You have roal

of the notations of Bessie's musical transcriptions.  They hav
 
been staring me in the face for months and only last night
 
able to sit down with Victor Grauer and give them a thorough
 
looking over.  First of all, he is most flattering about the
 
r
0u have done and the decisions you have arrived at.  He fec ::
 
nuite s u r e  that the situation you are coping with is, in its
 
n
eneral outlines, the one that Jones describes in his book oz..
 
frican music •
 It is in view of this that he has made a few
 
u
)estions about ways in which to handle the rhythm, which
 
ive the singer who wants to dig for it a sense of the rea f
l
.:
 
swinging quality of the tunes.
 In essence, he feels that,
 
't
hese songs as in much of African music, there is frequentT
 
alternation between measures of straight /
4 and irre
 
measuros.  You get two measures of 4/4, one of 3/8, one of 51L
3,
another two of L/
)4, etc.  The ties, he suggests,  should be
 
lightened in their effect so that the singer can f
 md the tom ,n
 
.
o
-footedly.  That is, instead of putting an 8th note before
 
the bar, you put a grace note and tie with a gliss sign.  Fur-
thermore, you note the irregularity of the meter by using a
 
dotted bar to divide the 3 from the 5 . 
In working this way,
 
singer can disregard the dotted bar and the grace note if he
 
likes,  or,  if not, can develop' his relationship to the 3 a
:i
 
by counting slowly,  still omitting the grace note; then, in the
 
final stage, put the grace note in.
 On some pages, we put not :
 
cbout how this night be done.
 It's not going to mean that whnt

I an
, much taken with the effect that Victor gets with this a - 
roach
  to the rhythm, as it seems to me that it corresponds
 
nicely to the feel of this music and to the heavy body ec .
 
that Bessie and her folks put in.  So much for rhythm.
 
I think the way that you are handling the variant tunes real
 
can't be improved on.  You are

Dear Bess,
 
Maybe this note will clear things up on the Bessie notations.  They seem to
 
be, in terms of my limited knowledge of this style, perfectly accurate, easy
 
to read, and singable.  My only suggestion is that you find a way of grouping
 
tkax some of the rhythm patterns so that their true impetus is clearer to
 
the singer.  What bothered i
ns, for instance, about PLUMB THE LINE is that your
 
notation would induce the singer to accent the d en measure 2 more than the
 
b.  My own feeling is that the third b of measure two is really the beginning
 
of a zkty rhythmic group, rather than just another l±g t x1wt u upbeat eighth
 
note.
 There are several ways of notating the song so that this pattern will
 
if
 
be expressed. (
see enclosed zkknlx sheet) By the way, I feel that1it i
s the
 
d which i
s reilly the most important note here
 the b before i
t
 
can really be treated as a grace note.  If, however, the tr*wz b is most im-
portant, then i
t should be the quarter note.  I suspect that Beasts slides to
 
the d anyhow, and this can be notated as on the music papir.  In any case, and
 
even if you feel that there i
s no glide and the rhythmic relationship between
 
the b and the d should remain as you have it, I think dotted lines separat*dg
 
the first three eighth notes from the last five of measure two will make the
 
situation much clearer.  It's interesting to note, by the way, that Itax
 
in this song at least, there is a xmgzztrx regular alternation between measures
 
of straight 4/4 and 4/4 measures divided into 3 plus 5
.  All that i
s required i
s
 
to insert a dotted line in the middle of every other bar.
 
I think that the basic principle of a 4/4 bar divided into 3/8 plus 5/8 can
 
be applied to almost all i
f not all of the synoopations.  I think that the new-
uses of this kini of notation is a lesser evil than strings of syncopated
 
quarter notes which are so diffCcult to sing accurately unless you beat your
 
foot so hard you z lose all flexibility.  A good case in point 18 GOOD BYE
 
AND FARE YOU WELL.  In bar three the singer has to sing  the words here and
 
2.
 
"long" to upbeats, t
L  two in a row, which is awkward.  I feel the d on the
 
word "long" as a downbeat and I
'm sure you agree.  In this case, the use of
 
a dotted line before the d is also awkward since it divides the bar ridiculously
 
into 7
28 plus 1/8.  Therefore, I suggest that, purely for practical reasons, you
 
re-bar the song, so that it begins on the third beat instead o
f the first.  I
 
agree that the song "feels" better at the beginning with i
i the barring that
 
you have, but I think the compromise is worth it, slneö the real problem comes
 
at that third bar.  35e enclosed ahhet for suggested change.
 
COME ON SISTi2 illustrates what I think is the difference between true synco-
pation and an actual rhythmic shift.  The If
mt first full bar is really not
 
syncopated (
neither were the r
lakjrix rhythms discussed above) but is a really
 
an alternation between 3/8 and 5/8.  The next bar, however, contains a true
 
syncopation which does not involve a rhy hmie ik'k
tx
 shift and feels much
 
different--much s
impler and ephemeral.  I think the division of the bar for
 
the rhythmic shift will, in addition to making the shift clearer, also clarify
 
the it difference between this effect and zj mzl�mx syncopation which is much
 
simpler.
 
PRETTY LIT T
hi GIRL M M and V
'P R  YOU GOIN BUZZARD are simpler and gmdx
 
'
I
 
clear as they are.
 
One more smalli idea.
 
I think that a lot of the slurs between twxtwmx
 
two notes o
f d
ifferent pitch would work bdtter as glissando marks.  I myself
 
feel more comfortable when I ig glide to these notes than when I just slur them.
 
Hope this helps you.  The  songs, though simple, are really fascinating.  I
 
hope you publish them and send me a free copy.
 
All best wishes,

 Incidentally, I don't have a stereo recorder; five of the

 I had to re-

the matter.
 The general co clusinn was that yo u  had taped

 I figured out that by f
lutting a lot of songs into 2/4 time,
 
could make the syncopation and the extra half measures (two  extru
 
oeats) look simi 1er; for exam ple, I could write out a song like

Because of misunderstandings that have arisen, this is to point out that
 
most British publishers define their exclusive territory as:
 
"The  British Commonwealth and Empire as politically constituted
 
at the date of this agreement together with South Africa, the
 
Irish Republic, Burma, Iraq, Jordan and the British Trusteeships."
 
In the case of books of American origin they give up Canada.
 
We understand the British Publishers' Traditional Market to be comprised of:
 
Aden
 
Ascension
 
Australia
 
Basutoland
 
Bechuanaland
 
British West Indies, comprising
 
Bahamas
 
Barbados
 
Bermuda
 
British Guiana
 
British Honduras
 
the Caicos, Cayman,
 
Leeward, Turks and
 
Windward Islands
 
Brunei
 
Burma
 
Ceylon
 
Cocos Island
 
Cyprus

Falkland Islands
 
Fiji
 
Gambia
 
Gibraltar
 
Ghana
 
Hong Kong
 
India
 
Iraq
 
Irish Republic
 
Israel*
 
Jamaica
 
Jordan
 
Kenya
 
Malawi
 
Malaysia, comprising
 
the Malayan Union

*at present optional
 
Malta and Gozo
 
Mauritius (including RodriL;uez)
 
Native States of India
 
New Zealand (including Ross)
 
Nigeria and the Cameroons
 
Northern Ireland
 
Pacific Islands, comprising
 
British Solomon Islands
 
Tonga
 
Western Samoa
 
Nauru Islands
 
New Hebrides
 
Gilbert and Ellice Islands
 
Union Islands (New Zealand)
 
Norfolk Island (Australia)
 
Papua and New Guinea (Australia)

United Kingdom (including
 
Northern Ireland, the
 
Isle of Man and
 
Channel Islands)
 
Zambia
 
In contrast to the exclusive territory listed above, The Open Market, so-
called, or perhaps more precisely, the Non-Exclusive Market, unless  otherwise
 
agreed is the Continent of Europe, and the rest of the world outside the
 
U.S.A.  and the Philippine Islands.

Dear Bess:
 
Was delighted to learn from Alan that you
 
have concluded your agreement with Doubleday
 
Book Publishing Company in regard to the
 
collections of songs by Bessie Jones.
 
As I informed Alan,  it  is our hope that we
 
can interest a recording company to  issue an
 
LP tied in with the book publication date,
 
or we might  even produce an LP in this regard.
 
Judy BeIL,of our office,  has spent considerable
 
time going through the available tapes of the
 
songs,  as sung by Bessie Jones,  and we find
 
these most useful  in determining which of the
 
songs could have  important possibilities for
 
recordings and p
erformances.
 
There are a number of titles  for which we have
 
no demonstration on tape,  and I' m told that per-
haps you would have these songs on tape:
 
--
-
EEN, GREEN THE CRAB APPLE TREE,  tape  5-9
 
--GREEN SALLY UP,  tape  5-9
 
--
--HEAD AND SHOULDERS BABY,  tape 5-7
 
I HAD AN OLD ROOSTER,  tape 5-11
 
LITTLE SALLY WALKER,  tape 5-5
 
LONDON BRIDG4  tape 5-10
 
- OH RANKY TANK,  tape 5-5
 
PEEP SQUIRREL,  tape 5-30
 
PIZZA PIZZA MIGHTY MOE,  tape 5-9
 
PRETTY PEAR TREE,  tape 5-9
 
PUNCHINELLO,  tape 5-6
 
WAY DOWN IN THE BINGO FARM,  tape  5-10
 
ZUDIE-O,  tape 5-6

We have just been advised by The Richmond Organization,
 
who publish some of the material you have created, that
 
you are not affiliated with our Performance Society. I
 
would like to point out some of the advantages of your
 
affiliating with BMI.
 
If you would contact me, I would be very pleased to
 
discuss the above in further detail.
 
Looking forward to hearing from you.

Have your letter of February 4th in rega:d to a number
 
of matters concerning the book you have compiled with
 
I have spoken to Josephine Rogers and assured her that
 
as soon as I sort out a number of matters involved, I
 
will prepare the proper writer credits and copyright
 
As for the copyright notices,  please understand that the
 
requirement of such copyright notice having to appear with
 
each song is based on the Copyright Law, which specifies
 
this as being a necessary procedure.
 Publishers request
 
this only because the Copyright Law itself specifies that
 
failure to do so will jeopardize the protections afforded
 
in the Copyright Law.
 
In reviewing your index, we note there are a number of
 
titles unknown to us and would appreciate knowing if the
 
songs listed below are derived from Bessie Jones' reper-
tory, or from other outside sources:

Dear Mrs.  Hawes:
 
Alan has sent me a copy of his February 10th letter,
 
written to you and we have noted his  information of
 
seven titles that come under the Bessie Jones agree-
ment with us.
 
Would like to hear from you in respect to my letter to
 
determine if there are any other titles  in your list
 
which indicate might be on our  list,  but under a different
 
title.

 would l

Mrs. Bess Hawes
 
2522 -
 24th Street
 
Santa Monica, California
 
Dear Bess:
 
The only thing I regret about the Sea Island copyright matters is that
 
I will now have to spend more time on the whole thing.
 I am inclined to
 
say at this point that I wish you hadn't got involved, because it just means
 
another few hours and a couple more gray hairs where they needn't have grown.
 
Did you know, by the way,  that Bessie and the Sea Islanders were
r x
 tt 
long and handsomely by Harry Belafonte and probably sold to him their entire
 
repertoire, which makes their previous copyrights valueless?  Bessie stayed
 
in town after the others went home, according to Mable, and since she doesn't
 
remember anything that doesn't suit  her dear heart
 ro ably sold hers all
 
over again, which would make three times.
 I am long past caring about the
 
whole thing.  It just shows you the best thing to do is not to help anybody
 
and to kick the underprivileged in the teeth whenever they come close to you.
 
I don't really mean that, but I gather that Belafonte, who has stolen every-
thing that was not hot and nailed down since he was a child, has convinced
 
Bessie that I have been doing her wrong.  She may have forgotten that, among
 
other things, she broke up my marriage by coming and living with us from the
 
third day after the honeymoon for three months and,when things went a little
 
wrong, as they sometimes do with newlyweds, advised Tony to put something in
 
my food, which poor Tony did and which completely wrecked us.
 Those old
 
home remedies are pretty hard to take.  As a folklorist, you know what I mean.
 
My advice to you, as from the beginning, was to pay absolutely no attention
 
to the whole problem and to get your bloody book out.  When, by the way,
 
i
s it coming?

There was nothing sharp in my last lettor
 
and hurried, as all my letters are nowadays.
 
I think your paper is magnificent in bouu oersions.
 I note
 
that you really know the literature and think you have polishec of
 
a study that can serve as a model for many others in the f
ield.
 
Alas,  so very few have your imagination and insight.
 
I had a long and, I think, useful (to you) talk wiub your noe
 
agent.
 I think it is a very good idea that you have her and I .

hope she can Fet some douTn out of Doubleday for you as soon as
 
possible.

New York, N.Y. 10019
 
Dear Mr.  Brackman:
 
Josephine Rogers, the agent who is handling the
 
book I
'm working on with Bessie Jones, recently sent me a letter
 
which she had written Alan asking about certain details on copy-
right matters; she wanted me to see if it was correct, according
 
to my understanding of the matter, and then send it on to him.
 
Coincidentally Alan phoned me, I mentioned the letter, he groaned
 
and then hollered a while about how busy he was and finally said
 
to send it to you.
 
A xerox copy of the disputed document is thus
 
enclosed; I have, however, sent the original to Alan so that
 
everyone will know what everyone else is doing.
 I gather that he
 
hopes you and Miss Rogers can clarify the problem between yourselves.
 
My own understanding is that the songs in the book should be listed
 
under the threeway arrangement already in effect between you, Alan
 
and Bessie; I only enter the picture as co-author of the book with
 
Bessie.
 I am perfectly satisfied with this arrangement, and it
 
only remains to settle the exact details.
 
While we are dealing with the subject, however,
 
I would like to go on record as strongly preferring to have the
 
copyright business mentioned only once somewhere in the book, rather
 
than under every song.
 I have, I hope, eliminated everything that
 
I R uqw!e1onged (so to say) to any of the other Sea Island Singers;
 
therefore all the songs in this book would be filed under the same
 
copyright description.
 Personally, I think the book would be far
 
more attractive and dignified in appearance if the legalities were
 
confined to a preliminary statement.
 
I a
n  enclosing a copy of the table of contents (as
 
it now appears) so that you can check on whether or not you have
 
copies of all the songs included for registration.
 I can send copies
 
of the words and music for any you don't have; again, I think all
 
these can legitimately be claimed by Bessie, but that's as much as
 
I care to say.
 mentioning this simply because I understand you
 
are also taking care of the other Sea Islanders' repertoires.
 Let
 
me know if you observe any mistakes.
 
I do hope you and Miss Rogers can get together
 
on this problem and get the matter cleared up easily.
 I only know
 
her through correspondence, but I think you will find her efficient
 
and extremely pleasant to deal with.
 
Sincerely,
 
c

Dear Alan:
 
Bessie, John at al are out here, and I have had several sessions with
 
them concerning the book.  She and I have agreed informally to give each
 
of the other Islanders (Mabel, John, Peter and  mea) $100.00 from our
 
advance (
that is, two hundred from each of us) as a fee for consultancy
 
on the book m
aterials.  This appears to satisfy everybody except, I think,
 
John, whose nose i
s somewhat out of joint.  He agrees that it i
s fair as
 
for a
s this book goes, but his masculine pride i
s hurt that Bessie i
s
 
getting all the attention in book-writing terms, and I don't blame him
 
as far a
s that goes.  I mentioned to his that be ought to get his life
 
down in interviews with you or somebody and he said he'd like to, and he'd
 
talk to Lomax about it the next t
ime be saw him.
 
He also got a bit insulted not to have been consulted about the copyright
 
problems on the various songs.  I sat his down alongside of Bessie yester-
day and read him off the list and he came up with the following statements:
 
Repertoire Accordtna to John:
 
Sea Islander songs:  (
Beasts agrees)
 
Hambone
 
Juba
 
Plaza Pizza Mighty Moe
 
Little Johnny Brown
 
Hanky Tank
 
Sandy Roe
 
Daniel
 
Sea Islander songs:
 (Bessie does not agree, says she taught
 
them to the Sea Islanders when she came)
 
Shoo Turkey
 
Knock Jim Crow
 
Johnny Cuckoo
 
Na Na Thread Needle
 
Horse and Buggy
 
Too co
n to be assigned to either one; therefore, according to
 
John's view, should be assigned to the group;
 
Go In and Out the Window
 
Punchinello
 
Little Sally Walker

I told John that i
t might be too l
ate, that, as for as I knew, the copy-
rights were already assigned and i
t would be impossible to change them,
 
However, I did tell his that I
 would write you what he felt about i
t,
 
which promise I am now discharging.  Do what you think would be practical;
 
I think John more wanted to be consulted than anything else.
 
I
've just written Shirley a lengthy letter about our plans which will no
 
d
oubt reach you along the f
amily communication l
ines.  Just to fill i
n
 
quickly, Butch and I
 will be leaving during July for a trip to Canada
 
t
o see Corey and Mike and then will return to Berkeley where I plan t
o
 
hole in for a year and s
tudy anthropology for which Dundee says he will
 
see to i
t that I get a MA in folklore.  So the academic world goes.
 
Butch and I are l
ooking forward to stirring ourselves up a bit; my main
 
concern i
s that the children should feel that we are following them t
oo
 
closely.  However, I decided that if they want to live where we want t
o
 
l
ive, that's no skin off my nose.  Naomi, in any event, i
s departing a
 
y
ear f
eom this June for northern India where she will study whatever i
t
 
i
s that l
emurs do.  John Bishop i
s also going along to act as T
IC p
hoto-
grapher f
or the various projects T
IC sponsors in India, so they have
 
decided to get married before they take off and we will no doubt be
 
organizing a
 we
dding sometime this year.  Corey i
s pregnant and will p
re-
sent us with our first grandchild sometime in January.  I do not know
 
what Nick i
s cooking up and as s
lightly scared t
o try and f
ind out.  We
 
are a l
ively bunch, aren't we ?
 
Much l
ove always  honey.  I have gotten excellent response f
rom everybody
 
I
've Play " the Black Encyclopedia record to •
 The major suggestion I
've
 
received i
s that another such record might be prepared, each cut to run
 
five or ten minutes, to be used as a basis for discussion in various
 
kinds of adult and high school study groups.  I
t's annoying how people
 
always come up with ideas of projects for other people to do, i
sn't i
t?
 
Anyway, several people are trying to get these used on t
he air and 1
 
hope to have some definite results to report soon

 PROTECTION OF SALE
 
The Author agrees that during the life of this agreement she will

V.
 OUT-OF-PRINT CONTINGENCY
  
The Publisher shall have the foregoing rights so long as it keeps
 
the Work in print, subject to the following:
 
1
.  If the Work goes out of print and the Publisher fails to
 
reprint within six (
6) months after receipt of written demand from the
 
Author to do so,  the Author may terminate this agreement by written
 
notice, which termination shall occur thirty (
30) days after the
 
Publisher's receipt of such notice.
 
2.  The Work shall not be deemed out of print so long as it is
 
available for sale either from stock from the Publisher's warehouse or in
 
the field.
 
3.  Upon such termination all rights granted hereunder except as
 
provided for in this paragraph shall revert to the Author, and the
 
Publisher shall be under no further obligation to the Author except that
 
all royalties under this agreement shall be paid as they become due.
 
VI.  ADVANCE
 
The Publisher shall pay the Author an advance of $500.00 which
 
shall be applied by the Publisher against the royalties to be paid by the
 
Publisher to the Author and which shall be payable upon the signing of
 
this agreement.
 
VII.
 ROYALTIES
 
Except in cases hereinafter provided, the Publisher shall pay the
 
Author, on all copies sold at full price less an allowable discount,
 
royalty of 10 percent on the clothbound copies and 7 percent on the
 
paperbound copies.  The said royalty shall be computed on the Press's net
 
receipts.  The Press shall render a statement of account annually, as of
 
June 30 of each year, and shall make settlements in cash with three (3)
 
months after the date of the statement.  No royalty shall be paid on any
 
copies sold at or below manufacturing cost.
 Payments amounting to less
 
that $
15.00 are normally held until royalties in excess of this amount
 
are accumulated.  Should the Author receive an overpayment of royalty
 
arising from copies reported sold but subsequently returned, the
 
Publisher may deduct such overpayment from any other sums due the Author,
 
it being understood, however,  that the term "overpayment" does not apply
 
to an unearned advance specifically agreed to as applying to one book.
 
2
 
VIII.  COMPLIMENTARY COPIES
 
Upon publication the Author shall receive 5 complimentary copies
 
of the Publisher's cloth edition and 10 complimentary copies of the
 
paperbound edition.  The author may purchase additional copies of either
 
edition at a discount of 40 percent off list price plus shipping charges.
 
XIV.  BINDING ON HEIRS AND ASSIGNS
 
This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
 
the heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns of both parties and
 
shall be governed by the law of the United States of America and the
 
State of Georgia, both as to interpretation and performance.  It may be
 
assigned as a whole (but not in part) by either party with the advance
 
written consent of the other.
 
Made this day at Athens, Georgia.

This is a small but highly influential publication and gets around all over

Finally, would you please ask your shipping department to send me another 10
 
copies of Step It Down to my home:
 
I Kvuld like to get the author's discount, of course, and will remit in full
 
upon redeipt of a bill including shipping etc.
 
Thank you very much for your help on all these small but to me significant

Dear Ms. Hawes:
 
The end of the year presents me with a perfect opportunity for
 
attending to long-neglected business.
 I do not believe I ever
 
provided you with a copy of the review roster for Step It Down. 
If
 
this is indeed the case, please examine the enclosed list and pardon
 
my unnecessary delays.
 Books went out long ago, of course, but if
 
you think an important review outlet has been omitted from the list
 
please notify us and we will be happy to send out additional copies
 
of your book.
 
I hope this holiday season finds you in good spirits and health.
 We
 
will be sending you copies of reviews of your book and advertisments
 
in which it was included periodically throughout the upcoming months.
 
In the meantime, please do not hesitate to contact me if I can be of
 
any service.
 
Sincerely,
 
Kristin Bluemel

Dear Mr. Pazzanese,
 
It's been so long since you wrote me I expect you've forgotten all about it
 
by now.  The truth is I just haven't had the time to organize the kind of
 
information you requested for your newsletter, nor did anybody else in the
 
small shop known as Folk Arts.  There are only six of us here, we work very
 
hard at our primary objective -
-
 a granting program -
-
 and much as we would
 
like to we just can't handle special requests for articles and the like in
 
good time.
 
Step It Down has just been reissued by the University of Georgia Press, and
 
I have asked them to send you a copy for review.  You can find out about the
 
Georgia Sea Island Singers, in their current form -
-
 by getting in touch With
 
Frankie and Doug Quimby at 2428 Cleburne, Brunswick, GA  31520,(912/265-9545).
 
The person who made Say Amen, Somebody, is George Nierenberg and you can
 
reach him at GTN Productions, 230 Park Ave., Suite 460, New York  NY  10017 ,
 
(
212/986-5557).
 
We will be getting out new guidelines some time this summer, and the Endowment's
 
Annual Report that gives all our grants for FY 87 will be out soon too.  I
 
will try to see that you receive copies though you will probably have to order -
 
and pay for the Annual Report itself.  In the meantime I
'm enclosing our current
 
brochure which you might not have along with a copy of last year's Heritage
 
award program book which lists (on the last page) all ouraawards under that
 
category.  I hope som e of this will be useful.
 
With all best regards.  By the way, why don't you put us on your mailing list?
 
I
've never seen your newsletter.  If there is a charge, please let me know.
 
Sincerely,
 
Bess Lomax Hawes

Dear Bess:
 
I am writing to update you on Cultural Views' activities.
 
The newsletter, well into its first year, has readers all over
 
the United States and Canada.
 Our first issue was on "Folklore
 
in education";  it included an article about an in-school oral
 
history program in Cambridge, MA,  a lullaby-collecting project
 
which New York City's Julia Lebentritt directed,  and a profile
 
of Arts,  Inc.  on the Lower East Side.
 We now have an issue on
 
"International children's art exchange programs" at the printer
 
and another about "Storytelling"  in the design stages.
 
We are planning a winter issue on "multicultural songs."
 
I am wondering if you could send me information about films
 
or other media productions that are about traditional music
 
to include in this last issue.
 I was interested in knowing
 
how to get information about the film,  "Say Amen,  Somebody,"
 
and if there are any documentaries on the Georgia Sea Island
 
singers.
 Any information you have will be greatly appreciated.
 
Also,  please send along information about the book,  Step It
  
Down.
 
I also wondered if you would be willing to write a short
 
article about the Quimbys or the contributions of Miss Bessie
 
Jones,  focusing on how they have passed down their songs to
 
young people in communities and schools, keeping the tradition
 
very much alive.
 This article could be 3-6 typed pages,  and
 
black and white photos would be helpful.
 I would need this
 
by January 10.
 
I look forward to hearing from you.
 My phone number is
 
1-524-2819.
 
Sincerely,

Dear Me. Orchard:
 
Herewith at long last the contract for reprinting Step It Down together with a
 
proposed introduction to the re-issue.  If you feel the latter needs editing,
 
I am used to being edited and don't take offense (
though I may bleed a little
 
quietly)
 
I am still looking for pictures and hope some good ones will eventually reach
 
you.  Mrs. Jones wasn't very photogenic somehow, a quality she shared with me,
 
but I will keep looking for some that look vaguely like her.
 
I am going on the assumption that the matter of increasing royalties will be
 
written into the contract as we discussed it over the phone, also that my
 
request that Douglass and Frankie Quimby receive copies at cost will be honored.
 
You will probably also be relieved to learn that all royalties should be sent
 
to me.  I will donate them in Bessie's na m
e to appropriate causes, such as the
 
ongoing Georgia Sea Island Festival and the Zora Neale Hurston Memorial Fund.
 
Best wishes, and please let me know how matters evolve and what the potential
 
publication deadline may turn out to be.
 
Sincerely,
 
Bess Lomax Haves
