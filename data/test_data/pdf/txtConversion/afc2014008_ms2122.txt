and engaging ideas.  People will be on the lookout for them,
 
interested to hear about them,  even to the point,  perhaps of
 
ear-marking some funds for them!
 
And now that the evil subject of money has come up,  I
 
can't resist throwing in an observation the novelist,  Kurt
 
Vonnegut,  once made pointing out that in any transaction
 
involving the transfer of money from one person to another
 
there is always,  as he called it,  a "magical moment",  a split
 
second,  during which the money doesn't exactly belong to
 
anybody,  And that,  says Mr. Vonnegut,  is the moment in which
 
somebody else can nip in there and get it.  He regarded
 
cashing in on the magical moment as the chief activity of
 
lawyers -
-
 but it's perhaps worth recommending to arts
 
workers as well.  Keep your eyes open.  Opportunities don't
 
come around very often;  we must be ready when they come.
 
So,  now is the time for every person in this room to
 
think hard about what could make your own particular piece of
 
this far-flung and complex field glow with health and vigor
 
and joy.  What does the art form you are interested in need?
 
What do its artists need? Maybe you have had some nifty ideas
 
on this already.  Well,  now is a truly favorable moment to
 
organize it into a form that could be a beacon -
-
 or anyway a
 
birthday candle -
-
 for the 21st century.  I myself hope that a
 
large part of this conference will be devoted to exchanging
 
ideas notso much about how to set things up  (which Americans
 
adore to talk about)  but about what ought to be set up or
 
what could be set up  (which we find a lot harder).
 
But getting back to my looking backwards to see if
 
thereby we can see forwards,  it does seem to me that some
 
different things have been happening in the past ten years,
 
some of which we might well be able to build upon.
 
For one thing,  the field of folk arts is gradually
 
becoming respectable. All right,  we are not and probably
 
never will be a strongly-institutionalized,  heavily-
researched,  broadly-supported arts field like ballet or easel
 
painting where everybody knows exactly what you are talking
 
about.  But more and more people have a good working idea of
 
what is meant by the term,  folk arts;  and our general
 
reputation for excellence is building.  One major arts
 
advocate has said that no state arts agency should exist
 
without the inclusion of the folk arts.
 
So,  here we are,  not just holding our own but
 
increasingly present,  increasingly called upon to demonstrate
 
the values that art can provide a complex and multi-parted
 
people.  On my bulletin board at home is a monthly calendar -
-
California Indian Arts,  1997 -
-
 in which an easel painting by
 
Harry Fonseca now of Santa Fe is followed by a photograph of
 
traditional Bow,  Arrows and Quiver,  made by George Blake,  who
 
earned a National Endowment for the Arts Heritage Award in
 
1992.  Both are unforgettable images and unforgettably
 
different. And there is no difference in the importance that
 
the calendar gives the two images,  and that is a fairly
 
recent development. Perhaps we should give additional serious
 
consideration as to how to ensure the simple inclusion of
 
traditional arts in more artistic events and venues.
 
Which brings me to a cautionary observation.  This ever-
growing inclusion of folk art has occurred because we have
 
insisted that these arts be taken seriously.  It is no longer
 
enough for a kindergarten class to play "California Indian
 
acorn basket making" by weaving little paper strips together
 
or to announce that the folk arts are great because Aaron
 
Copland used a few traditional fiddle tunes in his Rodeo.
 
There is nothing wrong with such things,  but at some point,
 
traditional arts must be enjoyed,  and evaluated in their
 
original form.
 
You notice I said "evaluated".  If I were in the audience
 
taking notes at this moment,  I would underline that -
-
 and I
 
would be maybe a bit worried...
 
But like all art,  the traditional arts thrive upon a
 
balanced diet of appreciation and criticism,  two sides of the
 
same activity.  Serious criticism must be advanced by one or
 
both of two groups -
-
 first,  the traditional artists of the
 
community who have absorbed the tradition through their bones
 
even though they may not have articulated it;  secondly,  those
 
other blessed individuals who have become so totally
 
captivated by a particular art form that they have studied
 
absolutely everything about it.
 
Now this latter group may well be from the traditional
 
community;  more often,  its members turn out to be outsiders.
 
But it really doesn't matter.  The issue,  you see,  is
 
knowledge,  expertise,  broad-scale experience,  sympathy,
 and
 
understanding.  We
  neeci such people to keep standards up,  and
 
to keep the fields truthful and honest.
 
You know,  the really important thing is not to lie.  If a
 
dancer on television is using Irish dance movements to
 
suggest an Irish jig,  it is important not to say that this is
 
a traditional Irish dance,  because it isn't.  That doesn't
 
mean that it is not a wonderful dance;  it  just is not a
 
traditional Irish jig.  Making distinctions,  as my friend
 
Barbara Rahm likes to say,  is not the same thing as making
 
judgments,  And so if a quilt borrows rural Pennsylvania
 
designs and colors,  though it may be splendid,  it is
 
important not to say that it is an Amish quilt -
-
 unless it
 
actually is.
 
I think we all understand such blatant examples. But
 
when we have to make similar decisions on a local level,  I
 
have noticed that we often tend to weasel out of our overall
 
responsibility of supporting the finest and most genuine
 
expressions of our many participating cultures.  It will help
 
immeasurably if right from the beginning of any project you
 
involve local,  regional,  or national expertise,  all of which
 
are available from many sources and all of which will help
 
project your activities onto an advanced level,
 
Let me be up front about something. A great many people
 
are chronically nervous about such issues as the fact that
 
most local Cambodian community teen-agers have a rock band
 
that they think is  just as Cambodian as the formalized court
 
dances of their homeland,  because,  after all,  they are
 
Cambodians and besides they are mostly singing in Khmer.
 
Now we do not have to scourge such youngsters from the
 
folkloric temple,  we just should identify them for the art
 
they produce -
-
 which is Cambodian interpretations of
 
American popular music. And then we should present them not
 
as representatives of the Cambodian musical future -
-
 who
 
knows what that can be? -
-
 but as a simple part of the
 
current Cambodian cultural scene.  That is
 present them if
 
they are any good. And they will know that themselves.
 
Remember:  all cultures make many kinds of music and
 
produce many kinds of art all at the same time.Much of the
 
field of folk arts has been concerned with finding and
 
supporting the oldest and deepest forms within a culture,
 
including those forms which are arising out of the old.  But
 
that does not mean -
-
 and never has meant -
-
 that there is
 
nothing else worthy to listen to or look at.  It is the task,
 
by the way,  of community arts programs to work within that
 
broader perspective.
 
In another development of the last years,  traditional
 
artists are now sometimes included,  as Dan Sheehy has pointed
 
out,  in programs designed for mass audiences,  and that is
 
truly new.  Twenty years ago,  if Linda Ronstadt had wanted a
 
mariachi accompaniment for her songs,  her record company or
 
t.v.  producer would have hired an arranger who would in turn
 
have hired a gaggle of studio musicians who would have read
 
the score and turned in a workmanlike facsimile of a great
 
Mexican musical tradition. Nowadays,  Miss Ronstadt is able to
 
work with the real thing -
-
 the Mariachi Vargas,  the great
 
mariachi from Mexico City -
-
 to the infinite benefit of the
 
music.  Perhaps at this conference we could begin to try to
 
think of other situations where the real thing could be
 
substituted for a copy.
 
Finally,  let me,  as I always do,  urge upon you more and
 
better field work.  I believe California is awash with
 
traditional artists of all shapes and sizes -
-
 from the
 
master immigrant musician who doesn't know how to find a way
 
into the musical world in this strange country and so falls
 
silent,  to the exquisite carver who has no idea that
 
whittling is considered by many an art form.  Such people
 
don't stand out on street corners saying "1 am a folk artist
 
-
-
 hire me",  nor do they often fill in questionnaires or
 
application forms.
 
They can and they do learn,  but they almost always need
 
help to polish up not simply their bureaucratic skills but
 
often even their art itself,  because it may well have
 
deteriorated through lack of practice.  This again is where
 
calling in outside expertise is helpful;  someone who knows
 
the Philippine rondalla tradition thoroughly can often help
 
recognize the real needs of a local group -
-
 perhaps the
 
inclusion of an older musician with a different repertoire,
 
or the location of higher quality instruments,  or bringing in
 
a master teacher for a few weeks.
 
In 1975 the Smithsonian Institution hired me to organize
 
an effort to bring exemplars of the traditional arts of
 
central California to Washington to join in the folklife
 
festival on the National Mall.  Lots of people at that time
 
told me that Californians didn't really have any traditional
 
arts -
-
 the state was  just too modern and too
 
wondered why I wasn't particularly interested
 
stands shaped like an orange or the important
 
San Fernando Valley backyard barbecue.
 
I fooled them,  though.  I got together a
 
class field workers,  including Dan Sheehy who
 
become my closest colleague,  and they devoted
 
goofy and they
 
in orange juice
 
foodways of the
 
team of first
 
was later to
 
their expertise
 
to locating and identifying outstanding traditional artists
 
from San Francisco to Baja California. And by the beginning
 
of the summer I had to beg the Smithsonian to provide the
 
money to bring in at least a hundred artists,  and everybody
 
admitted I well could have included more.
 
Well,  this is supposed to be a conference,  not a lecture
 
series.
 
 
I
 
Do lots of talking these two days,  my dear friends,  and
 
try to remember one or two of the points I have made: bring
 
out your best ideas as to what to do;  don't spend too much
 
time on bureaucratic implementation  (
you can handle a lot of
 
that later on E mail);  do lots of field work;  assemble the
 
best expertise you can locate to help you;  tell the truth;
 
be brave and adventurous;  and above all have fun.  It's art
 
we're working with after all,  not widgets or instructional
 
manuals,  but the glories of the human imagination. And aren't
 
we lucky!

FOLK ARTS  IN THE FOREFRONT;  THE AGENDA FOR THE YEAR 2,000
 
This  is a pretty magniloquent title and I' m  not at all
 
sure  I' m upNt\o it especially in front of this marvellously
 
diverse group \\But
 there is one thing I can do perhaps better
 
than anyone els
 here and that's look back,  for I' m older
 
than most of you
 nd so  I can look back further.
 
I'll bet the e are some people in this room who weren't
 
even born in 1976 when we celebrated the Bi-Centennial,  But  I
 
was grown up by then,  and I was working on it and I learned
 
quite a few things from the experience.  Maybe these things
 
can be of some help while we' re thinking about the new
 
millenium.
 
You may not have realized
 this but  in 1976 a great many
 
people in the world of arts and humanities were really afraid
 
that revisiting the 1776 of\ he
 revolution and the early
 
colonies would just result ift a rash of super-patriotic and
 
jingoistic activities.  And so '
they opted out.  They tried not
 
to notice that the Bi-Centenni 4 was even there -
-
 not
 
everybody,  of course,  but a sign ficant number.
 
And that  I believe was a mis
ake,  and I hope we don't
 
repeat it with the year 2000.  It w ç a mistake because human
 
beings keep on and on celebrating th \ngs -
-
 having holidays,
 
putting on parades and pet contests a I garlic festivals and
 
fireworks exhibitions -
-
 for s
.
& pretty good reasons,  one of
 
which is to stir things up some,  and,  in the process,  to
 
attack the status quo.
 
If you stop and think about it,  festivals and
 
celebrations are constructed to disrupt the ó derly flow of
 
everyday life.  They carve out  special time froç the routine.
 
Now why is that  important? -
-
 Well,  it's not on
 because
 
people get bored with the day to day,  but because things have
  
to be disrupted from time to time so that new and �±fferent
 
ideas can sneak in there and get tried out.

I  - 
present some new
 
and engaging ide
. People will be on the lookout for them,
 
interested to hea \aboUt them,  even to the point,  perhaps of
 
ear-marking some fu ds for them
 
And now that th' evil subject of money has come up,  I
 
can't resist throwing  f
l an observation the novelist,  Kurt
 
Vonnegut,  once made p01
 ing out that in any transaction
 
involving the transfer of  oney from one person to another
 
there is always,  as he ca11 * it,  a "magical moment",  a split
 
second,  during which the mone
oeSf
l't exactly belong to
 
anybody, And that,  says Mr. Vonn gut,  is the moment in which
 
somebody else can nip in there antkI
,get it.  He regarded
 
cashing in on the magical moment a
the chief activity of
 
lawyers -
-
 but it's perhaps worth r ecommending to arts
 
workers as well.  Keep your eyes open.
 \ p por tu nitieS don't
 
come around very often; we must be ready whef
l they come.
 
s
w is the 
1m 
fp  
every persori\
L this--
room to
 
think hard about what could ma ke  your
 own p rticular piece of
 
this far-flung and complex fie ld  glow
 with
 h
lth
 and
 vigor
 
and joy. What does the art form
 you  are  intere
ed in need?
 
What do its artists need? Maybe you have had som \nifty ideas
 
on this already. Well,  now is a truly favorable mo
t to
 
organize it into a form that cou ld  be  a beacon -
- or\ nywaY a
 
birthday candle -
-
 for the 21st century.  I myself hope" that a
 
large part of this conference will be devoted to exchanging
 
ideas notso much about how to set things up  (which Americans
 
adore to talk about)  but about what ought to be set up or
 
what could be. set up  (which we find a lot harder)
 
gett

 m.
 oking backwards
 
A to see  if  
thereby we ca\ see forwards.\ it does seem to me that some
 
different thin4p have been h ppenif
lg in the past ten years,
 
\
 
some of which we\might well bç able to build upon.
 
For one thing,  the field of folk arts is gradually
 
becoming respectabl
'
 All right  we are not and probably
 
never will be a
 heavily
 
researched,  broadly-supported art
 field like ballet or easel
 
painting where everybody knc
 what you are talking
 
peoples 0
 
li fornia Indian
 
about.  But more and more people have a good working idea of
 
what i
meant by the term, 1'olk arts;  and
 
general
 
reputati
n for excellence is\ uilding.  One m
or arts
 
advocate "bas said that no
 
without th
 inclusion
 
state arts agency should exist
 
of the fo c arts.

J\ )

Arts,  1997 -
-
 in which an easel painting by
 
A
 
Harry Fonseca now of Santa Fe is followed by a photograph of
 
traditional Bow,  Arrows and Quiver,  made by George Blake,  who
 
earned a National Endowment for the Arts Heritage Award in
 
1992.  Both are unforgettable images and unforgettably
 
different. And there is
 o difference in the importance that
 
the calendar gives the two images,  and that is a fairly
 
recent development.  Perhaps we should give additional serious
 
consideration as to how to en ure the simple inclusion of
 
o
f
 
arts in more artistic events and venues.
 
Which brings me to a cautionary observation.  This ever-
growing inclusion of folk art has occurred because we have
 
insisted that these arts be taken seriously.  It is no longer
 
enough for a kindergarten class to pJ
y "California Indian
 
acorn basket making" by weaving little paper strips together
 
or to announce that the folk arts are great because Aaron
 
Copland used a few traditional fiddle tune
 in his Rodeo.
 
There is nothing wrong with such things,  bu€". at some point,
 
traditional arts must be enjoyed  and evaluated in their
 
original form.
 Q
. 4
 
Y u notice I said "evaluated".  If I were in
, the audience
 
taking notes at this moment,  I would i
 -
 -
.
 -
 - 
'
I 
would be maybe a bit worr
-ied...
 
But
ike all art,  t4te traditional arts thrive upon a
 
balanced diet of appreciation and criticism,  two sides of the
 
same activity.  Serious criticism must be advanced by
 ne or
 
both of two groups -
-
 first,  the traditional artists of the
 
community who have absorbed the tradition through their bones
 
even though they may not have articulated it;  secondly,  those
 
other blessed individuals who have become so totally
 
captivated by a particular art form that they have studied
 
absolutely everything about it.
 
Now this latter group may well be from the traditional
 
community; more often,  its members turn out to be outsiders.
 
But it really doesn't matter.  The issue,  you see,  is
 
knowledge,  expertise,  broad-scale experience,  sympathy,
 and
 
understanding.  We
  need such people to keep standards up,  and
 
to keep the fields truthful and honest.
 
You know,  the really important thing is not to lie.  If a
 
dancer on television is using Irish dance movements to
 
A
 
suggest an Irish jig,  it is important not to say that this is
 
a traditional Irish dance,  because it isn't.  That doesn't
 
mean that it is not a wonderful dance;  it just is not a
 
traditional Irish jig.  Making distinctions,  as my friend
 
Barbara Rahm liked to say,  is not the same thing as making
 
judgments,
 Jf a- quilt borrows rural Pennsylvania
 
designs and colors,  though it may be splendid,  it is
 
important not to say that it is an Amish quilt -
-
 unless it
 
actually is.
 
\think we all understand such blatant examples.  But
 
when we have to make sir
n)Jar decisions on a local level,  I
 
have noticé
that we often tend to weasel out of our overall
 
responsibility\ of supporting the finest and most genuine
 
expressions of o r many participating culture .  It will help
 
immeasurably if, i
ht from the beginning of h
y project you c
 
involve local, /regionai
 or national expe]
ise,  a.l of which
 
are available' from many sources and all of which w f
l
-i help
 
project your activities onto an advanced level,
 
\  t me be up front about something. A great many people
 
are chronically nervous about such issues as the fact that
 
most local Cambodian community teen-agers have a rock band
 
that they think is just as Cambodian as the formalized court
 
dances of their homeland,  because,  after all,  they are
 
Cambodians and besides they are mostly singing in Khmer.
 
NOW we do not have to scourge such youngsters from the
 
folkloric temple,  we just should identify them for the art
 
they produce -
-
 which is Cambodian interpretations of
 
American popular music. And then we should present them not
 
as representatives of the Cambodian musical future -
-
 who
 
knows what that can be? -
-
 but as a simple part of the
 
current Cambodian cultural scene.  That is -
-
 present them if
 
they are any good. And they will know that themselves.
 
Remember:  all cultures make many kinds of music and
 
produce many kinds of art all at the same time.Much of the
 
field of folk arts has been concerned with finding and
 
supporting the oldest and deepest forms within a culture,
 
including those forms which are arising out of the old. But
 
that does not mean -
-
 and never has meant -
-
 that there is

In another development of the last years,  traditional
 
artists are now C
' 
'
-
included,  as Dan Sheehy has pointed
 
out,  in programs designed for mass audiences,  and that is
 
truly new.  Twenty years ago,  if Linda Ronstadt had wanted a
 
mariachi accompaniment  for her songs,  her record company or
 
t.v.  producer would have hired an arranger who would in turn
 
have hired a gaggle of studio musicians who would have read
 
the score and turned in a workmanlike facsimile of a great
 
Mexican musical tradition. Nowadays,  Miss Ronstadt is able to
 
work with the real thing -
-
 the Mariachi Vargas,  the great
 
mariachi from Mexico City
 -
 to the infinite benefit of the
 
music.

don't stand out on street corners saying "
1: am a folk artist
 
- -
 hire me",  nor do they often fill in questionnaires or
 
application forms.
 
They can and they do learn,  but they almost always need  :
 
help to polish up not simply their bureaucratic skills but
 
often even their art itself,  because it may well have
 -
 
deteriorated through lack of practice.  This aga ri is where
 
calling in outside
 
expertise is helpful;  someo

a tradition thoroughly can often help
 
reà gnize the real needs of a local group -
-
 perhaps the
 
incl sion of an older musician with a different repertoire,
 
or th
 location of higher quality instruments.  or bringing in
 
a mast r teacher for a few weeks.
 
In
 75 the Smithsonian Institution hired me to organize
 
an effort b\o bring exemplars of the traditional arts of
 
central Cali
rnia to Washington to join in the folklife
 
festival on the National Mall.  Lots of péQple at that time
 
told me that Californians didn't really hai. any traditional
 
arts - -
 the state was  just too modern and too goofy and they
 
wondered why I wasn't particularly interested in orange juice
 
stands shaped like an orange or the important foodways of the
 
San Fernando Valley backyard' barbecUe.
 
I fooled them,  though.  I got together a team of first
 
class field workers,  including Dan Sheehy who was later to
 
become my closest colleague,  and they devoted their expertise
 
to locating and identifying outstanding. traditional artists
 
from San Francisco to Baja California. Anck by the beginning
 
of the summer I had to beg the Smithsonian to provide the
 
money to bring in at least a hundred artists \ and everybody
 
admitted I well could have included more.
