DICK & SULLIVAN, in the office of the Librarian of Congress at 
Washington, D. C. 
I WISH THEY'D DO IT NOW. 
Copyright secured 1879. 
Sung only by C. P. HYLAND, the favorite Irish Vocalist, 
Comedian and Dancer. 
Oh, I 
was born in sweet Killarney, 
One day when I 
was young; 
And that is just the reason why, 
The blarney's on my tongue, 
The night was dark and stormy. 
And the rain came pouring down, 
And the midwife Judy Carney lived, 
A 
long way out out of town; 
My father got the donkey out, 
And off wint in a 
crack, 
ith old Judy stuck behind him, 
Shure he very soon got back, 
That I 
was a 
purty baby 
All the neighbors did allow, 
They brought the girls to kiss me then. 
I 
wish they'd do it now. 
When I 
begau to cut my teeth, 
I 
used to cry all day; 
It's then the girls would pity me, 
I 
have often heard them say— 
Oh, bless his purty little gums, 
Oh, does his toothings ache ; 
I'd look straight in their faces, 
Because I 
could not speak. 
They'd feed me with a 
bottle, 
For my mother died one day; 
They'd stuff it down my throttle, 
For I'd have to suck away. 
They'd rock me in the cradle, 
And if I 
kicked up a 
row ; 
Then they'd feed me with ice cream, 
I 
wish they'd do it now. 
5 
I WISH THEY'D DO IT NOW. 
Continued. 
When nine months old a 
finer boy, 
I'm sure you never could find; 
My hair was black and shiny, 
And hung in curl behind. 
Then the girls would throw me up, 
And catch me like a 
ball, 
I 
wouldn't let them do it how 
For fear they'd let me fall. 
And when the summer time it come, 
And bathing did begin, 
They'd take me to the water side; 
And gently dip me in. 
They'd swim with me upon their treks; 
To bring curls on my brow, 
And dress me up in pretty clothes, 
I 
wish they'd do it now. 
Then my father he sent me 
To learn to read and write, 
'Tis then the girls would bother me, 
And tease me day and night ; 
Then stick pins in my breeches, 
With pain I 
must allow, 
The master used to whip me then, 
I 
wish he'd do it now. 
But now since I 
a 
man have grown, 
My early pleasures flown, 
I'm not so very happy for 
The girls let me alone. 
They all prefer a 
sweetheart 
To a 
baby, you'll allow; 
Any girl that wants a 
husband, 
Let her come and take me now. 
PADDY GET VP FROM TEE FIRE. 
Written and sung with great sucCess by C. P. HYLAND. 
MY 
name do you see is McGuire, 
And I'll quickly tell to you, 
A 
party girl I 
admire, 
Named Katy O'Donohu . 
She's lovely fat and rosey 
Believe me what I 
say ; 
And every night when I 
go in her house, 
The old woman will surely say— 
CHORUS. 
Paddy get up from the fire, 
And give that man a 
seat, 
Don't you see that's Mr. McGuire, 
That is courting your sister Kate ; 
You know right well he's got a 
farm. 
A 
little way out of town ; 
So get up out of that you imprudent brat, 
And let Mister McGuire sit down. 
The first time that I 
met this girl, 
She was dancing the tra la- la- lee, 
Although I 
was a_new-comer, 
She got fearfully mashed on me. 
I 
asked her could I 
see her home, 
And with her to take tea ; 
And as soon as ever I 
wint in the house, 
The old woman did joyfally say— 
Paddy get up, etc. 
We're married now and settled down, 
As you can plainly see ; 
We have got two little young ones 
To dance upon our knee. 
We never go to picnics now, 
Or do the tra la-
la-
la, 
But every night when I 
go in the house, 
The old woman will joyfully say— 
Paddy get up, etc.

THE BD-BUG. 
Written by PETE CANNON and sung by C. P: HYLAND. 
'Twas on one summer's evening, 
In the merry mouth of June, 
When all the city sewers 
Were sending forth perfume. 
It was in the middle of the night, 
The truth all for to state, 
A 
creature of heroic blood 
Was forced to meet his feet. 
Just about the hour of one o'clock, 
When Michael 'lacy woke, 
And sat down on a 
three-legged stool, 
All for to have a 
smoke. 
But before he'd time to light his pipe, 
I 
vow and do declare, 
He saw a 
dreadful creature, 
That looked most awful queer. 
A bed-bug stood forninst him, 
The largest ever known ; 
He pretended not to notice Mike, 
But chewed upon a 
bone. 
Perbaps you don't believe me, 
But without a 
word of lie, 
If he didn't weigh three hundred pounds, 
I 
hope I'll never die. 
Thin Michael went and leased 
A 
great big caving knife ; 
He thought it was no treason, 
To take the creature's life. 
If Buffalo Bill had seen him, 
I'm sure he would have fled, 
But Michael Flacy, noble Mike, 
Was not the least in dread. 
THE BED-BUG. 
Continued, 
Then Michael started for the beast, 
Being full of self-reliance ; 
With his heart right in his breast, 
Being full of self-defiance. 
But the bed-bug understood the move, 
And before that Michael knew, 
He knocked him clown upon the floor, 
And beat him black and blue. 
Then Michael he got up 
And struck out for him once more, 
And stabbed the bed-bug to the heart, 
And left him in his gore. 
To give the divil's imp his due, 
He was both brave and bold, 
But now he's dead and in his grave, 
To himself may it be told. 
Then Michael called a 
neighbor in, 
His name was Paddy Moore, 
And asked him did he ever see 
Such a 
bed-bug beast before. 
Says he, it's not a 
bed-bug, 
But the beast belongs to me, 
I 
brought it home with me last night, 
'Tis a 
turtle, don't you see. 
Then come all you bed-bug turtles, 
Wherever you may roam, 
Don't go floundering about 
In Mickey Flacy's room. 
For if you do you'll surely rue 
The day you come to life, 
For Michael Flacy will be there, 
All with his carving knife, 
BROWN UP THE FLUE. 
To 
my friend, C. 
P. 
HYLAND. 
As sung by CIIARLEY HAMMOND. 
I 
am going to tell a 
story what happened the other day, 
To a 
smart young linen draper's chap, who courted a 
cook so gay ; 
She invited him to tea and said I 
hope you will come,, 
dear Brown, 
For Master and Mrs. won't be in, they are going out 
of town, dear Brown, 
They are going out of town. 
Next Sunday, Brown, dressed in his best on cookey he 
did call, 
He threw stones at the window, but his love was in the 
hall, 
She opened the door, and smiling said, I 
am glad that 
you have come, dear Brown, 
That you have not not disappointed me, but that you 
have come to town, dear Brown, 
But that you have come to town. 
Then she took him in the kitchen— the kitchen down 
below, 
Cook had served some nice cold beef, for Brown it was 
a go; 
He was just enjoying a 
piece of ham, when he nearly 
choked, oh, law ! 
For just as though it was to b', a 
knock came to the 
door, 
Oh, laws! a 
knock came to the door. 
Says cooky, that's my master's knock, whatever shall 
we do ? 
Then she near fainted—poor Brown looked uncommon 
blue, 
Continued. 
First he sighed and then he cried, cooky, cooky, what 
the devil shall I 
do ? 
When a 
lucky thought came in cook's head, and she 
put Brown up the flue, 
She did, she put him up the flue. 
When Brown went up the flue, there was not much fire 
in the grate, 
He heard the master and Mrs. talk, said they, there's 
no mistake, 
But I 
hope they won't make up the fire or in the kitch-
en sup, 
But the master and Mrs. feeling cold, they made a 
roar-
ing fire up, 
They did, made a 
blazing fire up. 
Oh, dear, said Brown, what shall I 
do, it's getting aw-
ful hot, 
And I 
dare not go down below or I 
will be boiling in 
the pot ; 
Then step by step he then climbed up, endeavoring to 
get higher, 
But every foot sent down the soot, and set the flue on 
fire, 
He did, he set the flue on fire. 
Now the master wondering what was up, told cooky 
for to run 
And bring to him his powder flask and doubie-barrell-
gun, 
lie loaded it and fired it up, saying I think that will 
do, 
Well, the contents lodged— but I 
won't. swear, but it 
brought Brown down the flue, 
Mind .you, it brought Brown down the flue.

WHEN 
THE SOUP-HOUSE 
'
BELLS ARE 
RINGING. 
Written by JACK CONROY, for COilitov & DALEY. 
Sung with success by C. P. HYLAND. 
When the soup house bells are ringing, 
We then will be happy and gay ; 
It's then the tramps will he singing, 
For they get three meals day. 
What a 
glorious time we will have, 
All gathered in a 
group, 
A-sitting at a 
pine-board table, 
All drinking turtle- soup. 
Soup, soup, soup, soup, oh, 
When the glorious soup is boiling, 
Oh, my! what a 
healthy smell; 
Arrah, says Pat, the soup is fat, 
Shure don't we like it well. 
CHORUS. 
Mary had a 
little lamb, 
She kept company with an alderman, 
Oh, when the soup- house bells stops ringing, 
Good bye, sweetheart for a 
while ; 
It's then we will be singing, 
Three cheers for Blackweil's Isle. 
When the soup-house bells stop ringing, 
It's then we will have cramps. 
We will go out in the wide-world, 
And try to raise some stamps ; 
We'll travel around from yard to yard, 
And rob each chicken coop, 
You can bet your life we'll never want, 
For a 
bowl of chicken soup. 
Soup, soup, soup, soup, oh 
When the soup is boiling ; 
Oh, my what a 
healthy smell, 
Arrah, says Pat, the soup is fat, 
Shure don't we like it well. 
Mary had a 
little, etc. 
THE PINK UMBRELLA. 
Sung only by C. P. HYLAND. 
Oft, I'm odd in my way, now I 
must own, 
For oddness is a 
passion ; 
I 
like to imitate myself alone, 
Not led by anyone's fashion. 
Through street and quare I 
do declare, 
The style in which bellow, 
And pretty girls they all know me, 
As the swell with the Pink Umbrella. 
Cifonus. 
For a 
concert or a 
ball, I'm star of them all, 
Because Pm a 
jolly good fellow ; 
I'm enveid by swells adored by the belles, 
When out with my Pink Umbrella. 
While strolling through the park the other day, 
Just luckly it came raining ; 
It's there where I 
met a 
lady gay, 
Of the weather she was conplaining. 
She said her hat and shawl would spoil, 
I 
told her she could shelter 
Then she consented with a 
smile, 
To walk beneath my Pink Umbrella. 
For a 
concert, etc. 
Now I'm not of your lar-da-da-do sort, 
That think people vulgar when jolly; 
I'm a 
fellow that's very fond of sport, 
Though people call it folly. 
Pd rather my life be sweet and short, 
Than live forever in a 
cellar, 
Not one of you miserly fretting sort, 
Is the swell i,vlL11 V:e Pink Umbrella. 
For a 
concert, etc.

THE MARQUIS' BALL 
As sung by TONY PASTOR, with great success. 
Air. —.-
Lanigan's Ball. 
THE story is strange that I'm going now to tell 
you 
I've put it in song for I 
thought it would please, 
I 
have lately returned from the Ball that was given 
To the Marquis of Lorne and the Princess Louise ! 
Some noted big-bugs in this town were invited, 
The great men of our country went to Montreal; 
And the meaning of what I 
shall tell in my ditty, 
Is the fun made by them at the Marquis' Ball! 
Mary Walker in waltzing she broke her suspenders, 
And looked like a Scotchman when dressed for a 
reel; 
Ben Butler he swallowed the good eye that's left him 
So he's blind as a 
bat and can never more steal. 
Dennis Kearney hit Murphy the teetotal apostle ! 
For making the dimes he made Dennis feel small; 
Mr. Beecher his lips be did smack and cry " Glory !" 
When the princess he kissed at the Marquis' Ball! 
r - 
While dancing the pillow of old Peter Cooper 
Blew up and sent Edward his son, our next 
mayor; 
On the lookout for sin in the style of great Talmage 
To the places where blooming young woman are 
there. 
Continued. 
THE MARQUIS' BALL. 
General Grant for refusing the Crown of Bulgaria, 
Got a 
fine leather medal so neat and so small; 
The Widow Van Cott in a 
corner embraced him, 
As he eat all the lunch at the Marquis' Ball ! 
Soon General Spiuola for help he did " holler !" 
The dancers around they looked on with surprise, 
He had cut his own throat with the edge of his 
As to shave off the whiskers of Wallack he tries. 
Johnny Davenport waltzed 
1\ ith a countess from 
Ireland, 
But be fainted away in compass so small; 
When she told him her husband had " Sixty-Eight" 
papers, 
It threw quite a 
cloud on the Marquis's Ball ! 
The Marquis's of Lorne lie held fast to Miss Woodhull 
She wished on the sly with John Kelly to talk ; 
Colonel Mapleson punched the big snout of Martzek, 
For hissing the garter of Miss Minnie Hauck. 
Maggie Moore she " Struck Oil" 
on the bead of 
Mayor Ely! 
As a 
New York policeman astonished them all 
He said that a 
thief was caught by a 
detective, 
So surprise put an end to the Marquis" Ball ! 
GREENHORN ON THE FLY. 
Revised and sung by JOHNNY ROACH with great success. 
Goon people all, take my advice, and listen unto me, 
But don't put too much confidence in every man you see, 
They say, fine feathers make fine lards, but not so every one, 
For men will often wear broadcloth, to hide their little game, 
But whether they are fish or fowl it makes no difference to I, 
I 
know my business, you can bet, I'm a 
greenhorn on the fly. 
There's Madam Morris, from Corsica, who with her telescope, 
Your future wife or husband shows— Good gracious ! 
that's a 
joke, 
If you give to her but fifty cents, she'll send you a 
card by mail, 
I 
think they ought to find her a 
home, six months in the county 
jail. 
There's the seventh daughter of the seventh son to swindle you 
thcy'll try, 
But I 
know then- little euchre game, I'm a 
greenhorn on the 
fly. 
In Chatham s 
reet, the other day I 
took a 
walk along, 
I 
heard a 
fellow crying out, going, going, gone. 
Vl'ho bids for it, this fine gold watch, the finest ever seen, 
They thought I 
was a 
little flat—perhaps a 
little green— 
I 
says, excuse me, please, if I 
wink so with my eye, 
I 
know my business, you can bet, I'm a 
greenhorn on the 
fly. 
There are fifty kinds of swindling- mills in the papers every day, 
And lotteries where you draw a farm ( God knows how far 
away.) 
The police say they searched very hard to find old Stewart's 
corpse, 
But I 
don't think they looked very far from the city of New 
York, 
if Judge Hilton had been wise, my friends, fifty thousand dol-
lars he might have laid by, 
If he'd give that job to someone else, say the greenhorn that is 
fly. 
MR. JOHNNY :DOUGHERTY. 
Written and sung by HENRY CARNEY, with marked success at 
TONY PASTOR'S THEATRE, New York 
You'vE all heard of the solid men 
And men of great renown; 
But if you'll listen for awhile 
I'm certain you will own. 
That I'm the most respected. man 
In this great town ; and why ? 
It is because when I 
walk out 
You will hear the people cry 
I'm Mr. Johnny Dougherty, the tailor 
A man of great renown ; 
And everybody knows that to make a, suit of clothes 
I'm the very best you'll find in all the town. 
I've heard. them say a 
tailor is 
A 
ninth part of a 
man ; 
Let them get up and knock me 
Into nine parts if they can. 
Devil a 
one would ever dare 
To box me for a 
foe, 
For I 
can box as v, ell as stitch, 
As very well they know. 
I'm 'Lir Johnny Dougherty, etc. 
WOMAN'S RIGHTS. 
Written by FRANK LOUGHLIN. 
Sung by CHARLES LADENDORF, with great success. 
In this world now every day, there is something new, 
they say, 
At least so much we must admit, 
t-;e 
listen everyone, both the old and young, 
And hearken well unto my little cut. 
I 
will sing of woman's rights, and their domestic fights 
Mid the trouble which they cause when they're at 
home. 
If women had their way, they would surely rule the 
day, 
And cause many a 
poor man's heart to mourn. 
Admit them to the bar, let them drive a 
railroad car, 
Or at voting just give them a 
chance ; 
Your troubles will begin, an end put to your fun, 
When the women first begin to wear the pants. 
Repeat last four lines. 
There's as many wags to woman's tongue as there was 
wives to Brigham Young, 
If you don't believe it, marry one and try ; 
They are fond of fighting, that's what thay delight in, 
They are bound to have the lasb word or die. 
Upon the excise board they would make happy horde. 
They would closejip every drinking saloon ; 
WOMAN'S RIGHTS. 
Continued. 
Your heart would lose its cheer, when they'd stop your 
drfnking beer, 
All your rackets would go up in a 
balloon. 
And then they'd put the collar upon your every dollar, 
You'd have to pay the fiddler while th7'd dance. 
I 
tell you, boys. it's tough, and it's going to be rough, 
When the women first begin to sport the pants. 
Repeat last four lines. 
Now all woman are not the same, them all we must not 
blame, 
For bringing scorn upon the men ; 
Some are rather cold, others worth their weight in 
gold, 
And more a 
little jealous now and then. 
In our trouble and our woe through fire and smoke 
they'd go, 
To lend us if they could a 
helping hand; 
While some would sit serene, and rule us like a 
queen, 
And have us to obey while they'd command. 
Old maids would start a 
bureau, of husbands try a 
few, 
Oh, boys, if at the future you could glance ; 
You would see yourselves at home, rocking the baby 
all alone, 
While your wives would be out sporting in the 
pants. 
SHE WAS A VIRGIN ONLY NINETEEN YEARS 
OLD. 
As sung only by C. P. HYLAND, with immense success in all 
the principal places of amusement in United States. 
ONE day as I 
was walking, 
Down by the strand, 
I 
met a 
fair damsel, 
All hooped up so grand. 
She had feathers and finery, 
She had jewelry and gold, 
And she said she was a 
virgin. 
Only nineteen years old. 
Her fingers were taper, 
She'd a 
neck like the swan, 
Her nose was a 
turned up one, 
And her voice not to strong. 
In three weeks we were married, 
And they wedding bells told, 
That I 
married a 
virgin 
Only nineteen years old. 
When the wedding party broke up, 
We retired to rest, 
But my hair stood upright, 
When I 
saw my love undress. 
When a 
cart load of wading, 
From her waist she did unfold, 
Thinks I 
you're a 
virgin 
Only nineteen years old. 
Then she unscrewed her left leg, 
Right down from her knee, 
And she pulled off her fingers, 
I dated just three, 
SHE W AS A YLUGIN ONLY NINETEEN YEARS 
OLD. 
Continued. 
When she pulled out her glass eye, 
On the carpet it rolled, 
Thinks I 
that's very peculiar for a 
virgin 
Only nineteen years old. 
When she wipe off her eyebrows, 
I 
thought I 
would faint, 
And down from her thin cheeks, 
Scraped a 
cart load of paint. 
When shc pulled of her black wig, 
Her bald pate soon told, 
I'd married a 
virgin 
Only nineteen years old. 
When she pulled out her false teeth, 
Oh, my heart struck with terror, 
For her nose and her chin, 
Very near stuck together. 
When she pulled off her corset, 
A 
large hump I 
did behold, 
Thinks I 
you're a 
virgin 
Only nineteen years old. 
So young men take a 
warning, 
When a-courting you go, 
Be sure your bride is perfect 
From top to the toe. 
Or else you'll be sorry, 
And like me be sold, 
To sum piece of patched-up stuff, 
About ninety-nine years old.

TURN OF THE GAS, 
AT THE METER. 
Sung by C. 
PI 
HYLAND. 
A 
worthy old Scotchman was Peter McLean, 
In business for several years he had been, 
In a 
shop somcwhere out in the Hammersmith road, 
Where the neighbors all call him a 
stingy old toad. 
His habits were frugal, he lived all alone, 
Economy seemed grafted into the bone, 
And for fear of a 
fire ere at night he'd retire, 
He turn off the gas at the meter. 
CI 
IORUS. 
He'd turn off the gas at the meter, 
He'd turn off the gas at the meter, 
Every night he would go to the regions below, 
To turn off the gas at the meter. 
Now as he grew older he took in a 
maid, 
And fifteen bright soverigns a 
year to her paid, 
She had to attend to old Peter and cook, 
And sometimes she'd read him the news or a 
book. 
Now McLean, who'd a 
bachelor been all his life, 
Began to have thoughts about taking a 
wife, 
For with the old fellow, she'd go down the cellar, 
To turn off the gas at the meter. 
He'd turn off, etc. 
So useful his housekeeper to him he found, 
He soon raised her wages another five pounds, 
He then began spooning and telling such fibs, 
While she in return used to nudge his old ribs. 
Though sixty, ' twas plain he with cupid was struck, 
He kissed and squeezed her and called her his duck ; 
But though his love was so hot he never forgot 
To turn off the gas at the meter. 
He'd turn off, etc. 
MR. 
CARNEY FROM THE LAKESIDE. 
Originally sung with success by C. P. HYLAND, 
When I 
left dear old Ireland, 
On a 
bright sunny morn, 
And parted there on dry land, 
The place where I 
was born ; 
I 
landed here in the middle of the year 
Just of the Battery ; 
And made my trip on a 
great big ship, 
And come to America. 
Cnottus. 
For I 
come from sweet Killarney by the lakeside, 
Where the pretty little ducks and drakes ride ; 
For my name is Mr. Carney 
From the Lakes of sweet Killarney. 
In the land where the floury praties grow. 
As soon as ever I 
landed, 
My friends wanted to know 
How things were in old Ireland, 
Where the floury praties grow. 
They told me I 
was welcome, 
And took me by the hand, 
Then we danced and sung till morning light, 
In praise of Paddy's land. 
For I 
come from, etc. 
So now I'll say good evening, 
I 
can no longer stay; 
I've done my best to please you, 
And it's time I 
was away. 
So now I 
must be leaving, 
And just before T 
go, 
We'll give three cheers for Erin, 
Where the floury praties grow. 
For I 
come from, etc.

Sung by C. P. 
HYLAND. 
Sweet poteen, you deceiver, 
I 
love you just as well, 
Since the day when first I 
met you 
You threw o'er me a 
spell. 
You're winning, you're enticing, 
As soft as Asia's silk; 
I 
love you, oh, my darling, 
As the baby loves his milk, 
CHORUS. 
Then drink to your neighbors, 
Drink to your friends, 
The dew from the mountain stream; 
If you once took a 
drop, 
Ton my soul you'd never stop 
A-drinking of the sweet poteen. 
Old Bacchus, you deluder, 
With all your coaxing ways, 
You've enslaved me like a 
spider, 
When brought within my gaze, 
Wid whiskey I'm so frisky. 
From my head down to my toes 
I'd praise you, oh, my darling, 
To your friends or to your foes. 
Then drink to your neighbor, etc; 
POLITICAL SITUATION. 
AIR—" Great Big Steamer." 
As sung by LEW SMITH. 
You have heard the song of the Boulevard 
To go there you must get a 
card, 
And how the poor man works so hard 
From morning until evening ; 
I 
once for a 
man did vote, 
And he gave me a 
bit of a 
note, 
By himself it was surely wrote, 
For to get me a 
situation. 
CHORUS. 
For to use shovels and picks 
On stones and bricks and clubs and sticks, 
And all such tricks they're good for nix, 
And I'm heartly sick of political situations. 
They gave me a 
shovel in my hand, 
They told me to dig up the land; 
Says I 
to myself, I'll see you be hanged, 
To work up on the railway ; 
This is what I 
did say, 
To work ten hours a 
day 
I 
tell you it does not pay 
Up in a 
Hundred and Eighty-Ninth street. 
For to use shovels, etc. 
At night I 
lay me down to sleep 
The Yankee bugs around me creep, 
The divil a 
wink they'd let me sleep 
Till daylight in the morning ; 
Next morning when I 
arose, 
And quickly I'd slip on my clothes, 
And just think where I 
had to go 
Up to One Hundred and Eighty-Ninth street. 
In Eighteen Hundred and Forty Five, 
When Daniel O'Connell was alive, 
At such a 
job I'd never drive 
To keep myself from starving. 
And now, although I'm old and poor, 
There is one thing that is sure, 
I 
don't want any sinecure 
Up in One Hundred and Eighty-Ninth street.

Music by DAVE BRABA3I. 
Words by ED. HARRIGAN. 
Sling by HARRIGAN Sr HART. 
THERE'S a 
bit of clay on a 
little stim, 
That's sweet enough to ate, 
Whin filled up wid tobacco 
'Twould put a 
man to slope. 
'Twos introduced in Ireland 
In the days of Brian Borhue, 
I'd rather lose ray life, my boys, 
Than lose my honey- dew. 
Some call it Cavendish, 
Or any name you'd wish, 
And they dale it out in plug, you know. 
When it is fresh and green. 
When from my work I 
tire; 
I 
set down by the fire, 
An' I 
watch the smoke roll up and curl, 
From my little ould Duddeen. 
CHORUS. 
My duddeen you are so sweet to me, 
I 
love to see your smoke go up 
Whin I 
get through my tea; 
My duddeen, you are in the family. 
I'd surely die if I 
found out 
You were stole away from me. 
If ye studied history, 
Ye'll read where William Pinn, 
Bought the state of Pinnsylvania 
From the wild red Injin men, 
THE LITTLE OLD DIIDDEEN. 
Continued. 
He never used a 
sword or gun 
When he met them face to face, 
But they all sit down continted, 
And they smoked the pipe of peace. 
If ye'd only take a 
puff, 
Shure one would be enough 
To put you in a 
slumber, 
A 
stupor, or a 
dream. 
Ye might say it's not ginteel, 
But so beautiful I 
feel 
Whin I 
sit down in the corner, boys, 
Wid my little ould Duddeen. 
My Duddeen, etc. 
A 
Frenchman smokes the little thing 
They call the cigarette, 
It makes him feel uneasy, 
As he blows, and puffs, and frets; 
The Chinese smokes the opium, 
'Till it puts him in a 
doze. 
And the Yankee smokes the bad cigar, 
Wid one end to his nose, 
But every Irishman— 
Bould Patsey, Mike or Dan, 
That was born in clear old Ireland; 
Where the grasses grow so green, 
If they've no coat to their back ; 
They've that bit of clay so black • 
It's a 
consolation to them, 
Is the little ould Duddeen. 
My Duddeen, etc.

She is thoroughly conversant with the art of etiquetbe,

As sung by CHARLEY HAMMOND, Ballad and Comic Vocalist. 
They call me Benjamin, but why I 
cannot tell, 
For I 
am not simple for a 
man that's not a 
swell ; 
I 
take things very easy as I 
pass my time away, 
Quietly and coolly as I 
jog along each day. 
I 
am never in a 
hurry, for no matter what I 
do, 
I 
always do it properly and try to do so, too, 
So follow my example if you wish to get along, 
And if you'll only do o 
you'll never go far wrong, ( that is.) 
Don't be in a 
hurry, boys never be in haste, 
Never pay for luxuries before you have a 
taste, 
For if you are disappointed you will have to suck your thumb, 
So never buy the cradle, boys, before the baby comes. 
Now when I 
court the ladies, they like me as a 
rule, 
Because I 
do not grumble or make myself a 
fool, 
For I 
always do my courting in a 
proper style, 
And always get rewarded with a 
loving, pleasant smile; 
I 
know the way to please them, for I 
know what they all like 
And while the iron is hot is the proper time to strike, 
So I 
always am a 
favorite no matter where I 
be, 
And if you wi I 
take my tip, boys, you'll be the same as me, 
(that is.) 
Don't he in a 
hurry, etc. 
Now if you dream of marriage wait until pu are wed, 
Before you speculate voa cash in mattresses and bed, 
For girls are very artful and when they have gone to church, 
They have been known to change their minds and leave men 
in the lurch. 
But when the happy knot is tied they then legin to buy, 
Crockery and furniture but do not on the sly; 
Speculate in cradles first, for you would hang your head with 
shame, 
If you had the cradle waiting and the kid he never came, 
(what a 
suck.) 
Don't e 
ii a 
burry, etc.

bonny, bonny lass, 
And this bonny lass loves me, 
She is happy as the birds in the summmer time, 
And as busy as a 
bumble bee. 
Her hair is light her teeth is white, 
She as a 
roguish black eye, 
And when e'er I 
ask her for a

She is sure to cry —

Will you drop that, now. 
Mary is the name of this bonny, bonny lass, 
She is a 
pretty country queen. 
And search the country all around, 
Her equals can't be seen. 
I 
have courted her for twelve long months; 
She as always been the same, 
For when e'er I 
ask her for a 
kiss, 
She'll cry fie for shame. 
Stop that, now, etc. 
Where e'er I

She always says I 
will, 
And when the parson makes use one, 
We will live like Jack and Jill.

Our time will pass away, 
And when e'er I

THE HARP AND SHAMROCK OF ERIN. 
Written by TONI CARY. 
Sung by C. P. 
HYLAND, the favorite Irish Vocalist. 
I 
wear two lovely emblems, 
1 
wear them on my breast, 
A harp entwined with shamrocks, 
Are the emblems I 
love best. 
They're symbAs of old Erin, 
The land that gave me birth ; 
The sacred soil of Ireland, 
The dearest spot on earth. 
Cliont1s. 
The Harp and Shamrock of Erin, 
The Harp and the Shamrock for me; 
And while I've strength to raise 
Voice I'll sing in praise 
Of the I 
larp and Shamrock of Erin: 
When I 
see a 
bunch of Shamrocks, 
I 
think of Patrick's Day ; 
And when I 
hear the tune struck up, 
It makes my heart feel gay. 
My spirits overcomes me, 
I 
begin to shout and bawl, 
Then touch the Harp of Erin, 
And I'll sing you Tara's Hall. 
The old stone cross of Ireland, 
Is an Emblem great and grand ; 
With the wolf dog resting calmly, 
'Neath the round towers of our land. 
They're relics dear to Irishmen, 
No matter where they roam, 
Good men are always firm and true, 
To emblems of their home. 
I'd like to see old Erin's sons 
United heart and hand, 
To eradicate the prejudice 
That spoils our dear old land. 
Let's smother party feeling 
And let the whole world see, 
We love our native emblems 
And we live in unity.

Oh I 
a 
horrible story of late I've been told, 
My heart ceased to pulsate, my blood's chill and cold ; 
It's about a 
young damsel with a 
face full of scars, 
Who fell in love with a driver ou the Third Avenue 
cars. 
The driver was rich, and he worked in disguise, 
And the gal was a 
villain, though blue were her eyes ; 
Wheue'er she'd go near him he'd yelp loud and strong, 
Get thee gone, girl, 
get thee gone, girl—but the girl 
wouldn't get thee gone. 
Oh, she tortured him daily and hung on like glue, 
He wasted away till his clothes he fell through; 
He rented a 
yard and he slept in a 
shed, 
But the maiden hung on till his reason most fled. 
She'd crawl through a 
knot-hole and roost by his side, 
With a 
piece of blue ribbon his ancle she tied; 
He'd awake from his slumber, in a 
tragic voice say, 
Get the gone, girl, get the gone, girl, 
but they girl 
wouldn't get the way. 
Oh, she followed him up till one morning he died, 
He opened his mouth and his breath he let slide; 
In an alley they laid him te sleep his last sleep, 
Where the Thomas cats fight and the oyster cans weep. 
She fixed herself up with a 
new Ulster coat, 
With a 
glue pot his age on a 
shovel she wrote; 
Now she gets biling full and a 
voice to her shouts, 
Get thee out, girl, get thee out girl, but the girl won't 
get thee out.

this evening. 
What is the matter. 
HARRY—Yes, Moses, I

My gal met 
with an accident the other day. 
MOSES—Was it very serious? 
HARRY—Yes, indeed ; her mother sent her down stairs for a 
couple of pickled eels' feet, and she feel down stairs and run a 
knot hole up her eye. 
MOSES—I 
understand you were to be married to the young 
lady. 
HARRY—Yes ; I 
would have married her if she would have 
had me. 
MOSES—What was the cause of her refusing you ? 
HARRY—Some person went and told her that my name was 
Johnny Somersault. 
MOSES—Did she refuse you on that account ? 
HARRY—Yes, Moses ; for when I 
popped the question she 
said that she would never turn a 
somersault for me or any other 
man. 
JOHNNY, does you love me? 
Well, Susie, I 
does. 
How do you know you loves me, Johnny ? 
Kase, Su ie, whenever I 
looks at you my heart jumps and 
knocks my stummick so hard, that I 
don't have any appetite for 
a 
week afterwards.

From the Bummers' Hotel.

Mv name it is McGinty, yes

With O'Leary, the walker, I

For to walk a 
mile a

About half- past twelve o'clock last night, 
A gang gave me a 
terrible fright, 
They woke me up and set me tight, 
For to walk against O'Leary. 
They took me to a 
great big field, 
And with alcohol set me crazy, 
They stripped the clothes off to the skins, 
And it makes feel so lazy ; 
it was then the gang began to talk, 
Saying who is the terrier going to walk, 
And they said they would hang me if I 
d

walked against O'Leary. 
The first mile I 
walked my legs were weak, 
And the gang commenced to holler, 
They sprinkled salted upon the track, 
And it made me feel so lazy ; 
All the other walkers were ahead, 
Eating sponge cake, pie and bread, 
0 
heaven, I 
wish that I 
was dead, 
When I 
walked against O'Leary. 
I 
walked until I 
catchd the cramps, 
Around and around the track, 
All the ladies threw bouquets at me, 
There was a 
corn on my back. 
The judge told me it was time to stop, 
As around the track like a 
chicken I 
flop, 
For the want of a 
whiskey I 
thought I'd drop, 
The day I 
walked against O'Leary.

BIDDY THE BALLET GIRL. 
Written by J. BRADLEY, and sung with great success 1-‘v 
PAT ROONEY at Hairy Miner's New Theatre. 
I 
AM a 
gay laboring man, 
And I 
have a 
beautiful daughter, 
Who never did care much for work, 
It's her mother's own,wish that she oughter 
It seems that she fancied the stage, 
So I 
granted her final request, 
And now she a 
beautiful dancer, 
And ranks along with the best. 
CHORUS. 
On the stage she is Madame La Shortie, 
But her right name is Biddy McCarty, 
She brings home at night, and at matinees, 
Large baskets of flowers and also bouquets. 
Oh, she is my only daughter, 
And I 
am the man that taught her 
To wear spangled clothes, and go round on her toes, 
And there is no such a 
girl as Biddy. 
When salary day does arrive, 
All trouble and toil it does smother, 
For just the day before that there was a 
kick, 
The girl had been scolded by her mother; 
She's courting a 
clerk in the bank, 
Who sees her safe home at the door, 
And pays a 
big gang in the gallery, 
To applaud in a 
perfect uproar. 
On the stage, etc. 
Last Saturday night I 
got paid; 
I 
thought I 
would go to the theater, 
And take the old woman along; 
In the parquette in front I 
did seat her. 
When Biddy came out for to dance, 
My son Danny was up in the tier; 
He cried: " Go in, sister Biddy," 
When they bounced him right out on his ear.

THE BOY FROM COUNT Y CLARE. 
Continued. 
Nell O'Grady is a 
lady 
Sweet as buttermilk, 
Although she wears no quality airs 
Nor yet the gown of silk. 
She has no hat, but what of that I 
And though her arms are bare 
She is a 
jade to suit a 
blade 
Like Pat from County Clare. 
For, to turn a 
stick, etc. 
I 
told my love I'd weep above 
A 
teapot full of tears, 
Unless she'd say she'd come my way 
And comfort Paddy's years. 
"I will" said she, and smothered me 
With kisses on the nose, 
" 
I'm fond of that," said she " that's flat." 
From old shillelagh blows. 
For, to turn a 
stick, etc.. 
So Paddy's life and Paddy's wife 
Are both as bright as day. 
Not anywhere in County Clare 
Are two so blithe as they. 
With dance and song they jog along 
In fair and stormy weather, 
And when they die they mean to try 
And do so both together. 
For, to turn a 
stick, etc.

WALKING ON THE BRAIN . 
Composed and sung by P. J. DOWNEY. 
Air :-- All Broke Up To Day. 
Thstre is another fever out, it's caught by every one, 
Young girls and boys about it shout, old men are on the run, 
And when it takes a 
soul away, I'm sure it goes with pain ; 
The doctor says it's nothing more than walking on the brain. 
CI
loRnS. 
Both white and black with humpty back, 
They crawl to gain a 
name ; 
Give them a 
track, they'd ne'er come back, 
It's walking on the brain. 
Great walking now is all the rage in town as well as city, 
They try it now at every age, there's some we have to pity ; 
There's one great man they call Iona I 
fughes,he's now laid on 
the shelf, 
And if he shows his nibs again, I'll have to walk myself. 
Both white and black, etc. 
There was a 
match the other day up here in Gilmore's Garden, 
For noble fellows, so they ,cay, to walk their feet did harden ; 
Their tramping made the saw dust fly, the belt is gone away, 
But we will have it back again, there's truth in what I 
say 
Both whit , and btack, etc. 
It's right to let the best man win, although we all feel bad, 
But as he won it honestly, we're all as glad as mad ; 
Give all their due, there are but few such men in nature's dairy, 
As Rowell, Ennis, Ilarriman, along with Dan O'Leary. 
Both white and black, etc.

THE BELLS OF SHAND ON. 
M AIIONY• 
`• Old Melody. 
Price to 
cents.  
Music to be had of E. 
II : H ARDING, 229 Bowery, N. Y. 
With deep affection and recollection, 
I 
often think of those Shandon Bells, 
W 
hose sounds so wild would in days of childhood 
Fling round my cradle their magic spell ; 
On this I 
ponder, where'er I 
wander, 
And then grow fonder, sweet Cork of thee ; 
With thy bells of Shandon sound far more grand on 
The pleasant waters of the river Lee. 
I've heard bells chiming full many a 
clime in, 
Tolling sublime in cathedral shrine ; 
While at a 
glibe rate brass tongues would vibrate, 
But all their music spoke naught like thine ; 
For mem'ry dwelling, on each proud swelling 
A' 
Of thy belfry, knelling its bold notes free, - 
Made the bells of Shandon sound far more grand on 
The pleasant waters of the river Lee. 
I've heard bells tolling, " Oldi,Adrain's mole" in, 
Their thunders rolling from the Vatican, 
With cymbals glorious, swinging uproarious, 
In the gorgeous turrets of Notre Dame ; 
But thy sounds more sweeter than the dome of Peter 
Flings o'er the Tiber, pealing solemnly. 
t 
Oh! the bells of Shandon sound far more grand on 
The pleasant waters of the river Lee. 
There's a 
bell in Moscow, while on tow'r and kiosk 0 I 
In St. Sophia the Turkman gets, 
And loud in air calls men to prayer 
From the tap'ring summit of tall minarets; 
Such empty phantom Lfreely grant them ; 
But there's an emblem more &Tar to me, 
Kris the bells of Shandon that sound so grand 
The pleasant waters of the river Lee.

BECAUSE WE WERE POOR 
To my friends McCullough & Casey. 
Words arid Music by C. R, DOCKSTADER. 
Music can be had at Krakur & Co., 40 Union Square, N.' V: 
THERE'S a 
dear spot in Ireland that I 
long to see, 
It's my own native birth-place, and it's heaven to me ; 
Shure my poor widowed mother lived there all along, 
With my brothers and sisters, 'twas a bright happy 
home. 
We hadn't much money, but my own mother dear, 
Pressed a 
kiss on my brow, bade my heart be good 
cheer, 
But the shadow of poverty darkened our door, 
And I 
left Ireland and mother because we were poor. 
Citoaus. 
Oh, my thoughts all go back to that dear little spot. 
To my brothers and sisters and the little thatched cot ; 
To my poor widowed mother, I'll ne'er see her more— 
'Twas a 
shame but I 
left her because we were poor. 
I 
will never forget on that bright rosey morn, 
When old Ireland I 
left how my poor heart did mourn; 
Whin my blessed old mother said be of good cheer, 
Good-by, Michael darling, farewell mother, dear. 
Then my brothers and sisters took me by the hand, 
They bade me do right when I 
left Ireland; 
I 
bade them good-by at our own cottage door. 
And I 
left Ireland and mother because we were poor. 
Row said is me heart now me poor mother's dead, 
God bless and protect him were the last words she said, 
And the ring that my father gave, she sent to me, 
It's a 
far dearer gem thin bright gold ere could be. 
And my brothers and sisters I 
wish they were here, 
For I'm longing to see them, but they'll come never 
fear; 
I've a 
neat little cot on America's shore, 
We're happy, we'll live, yes, although we are poor. 
THE WATERMILL. 
As Recited by Gus W ILLIAMS. at TONY PASTOR'S; with great 
success. 
LISTEN to the watermill, through the livelong day, 
How the clicking of its wheel wears the hours away, 
Languidly the autumn wind stirs the greenwood leaves ; 
From the fields the reapers sing, binding up the sheaves ; 
And a 
proverb haunts my mind, as a 
spell is cast— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Autumn winds revive no more leaves that once are shed, 
And the sickle cannot reap corn once gathered; 
And the rippling stream flows on, tranquil, deep, and still, 
Never gliding back again to the watermill. 
Truly speaks the proverb old, with a 
meaning vast— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Take the lesson to thyself, loving heart, and true ; 
Golden years are fleeting by; youth is passing, too ; 
Learn to make the most of life lose no happy day, 
Time will never bring thee back chances swept away; 
Leave no tender word unsaid, love, while love shall last-
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Work while yet the daylight shines, man of strength and will, 
Never does the streamlet glide useless by the mill ; 
Wait not till to-morrow's sun beams, upon the way, 
All that though canst call thine own lies in thy—to-day; 
Power, intellect, and health may not always last— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Oh! the wasted hours of life that have drifted by; 
Oh! the good we might have done, lost without a 
sigh! 
Love that we might once have saved by a 
single word 
Thoughts conceived, but never penned, perishing, unheard. 
Take the proverb to thine heart, take and hold it fast— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Oh! love thy God and fellow- man, thyself consider last; 
For come it will, when thou must scan dark errors of the past ; 
And when the fight of life is o'er, and earth recedes from view, 
And Heaven in all its glory shines, ' midst the pure, the good, 
the true--
Then you'll see more clearly the proverb deep and vast--
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
THE IRISH BRIGADE. 
Sung by the W ILKINSON BROS., and JOHNSON & BRUNO. 
Oh, don't be alarmed, friends, at seeing us here, 
We're two gems of the very first water ; 
You can see by our clothes we are noblemen, too, 
And sons of the Marquises daughter. 
My mother, God bless her, she doted on us, 
Said of danger we ne'er was afraid, 
So when we arrived at manhood, a 
commission 
we 
bought, 
And I'm one of the Irish Brigade. 
CHORUS. 
Then hurrah ! hurrah I 
for the true sons of Erin, 
Her stout hearted soldiers are never afraid, 
We 
are true to the core mid to death ever daring, 
We've two noble sons of the Irish Brigades. 
The Irish Brigade they are one, true and brave, 
And for fighting, the best in the land, 
In peace they are trm_-hearted, cheerful and gay, 
And like lions in battle they stand. 
And I 
am their leader, I'm proud for to say, 
That my soldiers they dote upon me, 
For oft ' midst the roar of cannons they'll shout, 
Give a 
cheer boys for brave Col. Shea. 
Then hurrah ! hurrah ! etc. 
To the roll of the gun we marched gayly on 
Through the field 'midst the dead and the dying, 
And high through the air through the smoke can be 
seen, 
The green flag so uobly flying. 
And there it waves proudly amid shot and shell, 
As my men to the charge they are led; 
They'd fight till they'd die ere .an inch they would 
cry, 
In defence of the flag o'er their heads. 
Then hurrah ! hurrah ! etc. 
DAN AND TEDDIE'S PARTING. 
LWritten by C. R. DOCKsTADER for fInRLEY & M ARA. 
Sung with success and made popular by DEvuNt & TRACEY. 
I 
AM bidding you good bye Dan, dear,

Going to America;

And send for all of you. 
CHORUS.

And try and not be grieving. 
Bear this parting like a 
man— 
Teddie, I 
will try, 
Good-bye, Daniel, 
Farewell, "Ceddie, 
Daniel-- Ted— good bye.

sad one, 
Whin you have gone away, 
And we will watch until a

Comes across the sea. 
And mother says her prayer shall be, 
God speed her own son Tech. 
Yes, you'll be always in our mind, 
Each day we break our bread. 
Good -bye, Daniel dear etc, 
So now I 
must be leaving you, 
But, oh, it won't be long, 
save up every cent I 
earn, 
For I 
am young and strong. 
And whin I 
reach America. 
I'll be soon sending home 
The money for my brother Dan, 
To come across the foam. 
Good-bye, Daniel dear, etc. 
WHEN I'VE PASSED IN MY CHECKS. 
A parody on " See that my grave's kept green." 
By L. J. KOHLMANN (LEW COLE). 
W HEN I've passed in my checks and have flown 
from your side, my darling, 
When your humble servant is snugly stowed away 
in his cold drear grave, 
When my spirit has winged its flight to the ethe-
real spheres generally designated by the term 
Heaven, 
To the locality where sulphurous fires and brim-
stone is not known to exist. 
When you are in that state of happiness and gaiety 
naturally characteristic of your nature once 
again, 
Exercising your memory in thoughts pertaining to 
the happy time that has been, 
There exists one diminutive favor I 
would consid-
er an insult to my memory if you would fail 
to attend to, 
See that the mound that covers my artificial incrus-
tation is kept in its natural state of verdancy. 
Chorus. 
Oh! the periods of twenty-four hours each will 
come td you, my darling, 
When no more I 
shall be observable to the multi-
tude on this mundane sphere, 
WHEN I'VE PASSEl) IN MY CHECKS. 
Continued. 
One exquisite little wish, darling, I 
hope you will 
have the benevolence to grant me, 
Observe that the hillock that o'ertops my last rest-
ing-place is kept in its primitive state of 
perpetual greenness. 
Will you retain your humble servant, my love, in 
fond recollection, 
When the volubility of grumblers, in general, un-
pleasantly jars upon the sense of hearing, 
When others may utter their complaints in con-
demnation and faultfinding, 
Speak not one single word that does not savor of 
your usual kindness and benevolence; 
When you have as usual regained you equilibrity 
and exuberance of spirits once again, 
Remembering with vivid imagination the fond 
recollections of former days, 
There is but one small-sized wish I 
would have 
your royal highness attend to, 
See that my little narrow bed is kept in its origi-
nal and primitive state of freshness. 
Oh! the periods, etc. 
MY MARY ANN. 
Written for Miss KITTIR O'NErL, by ED. HARRIGAN% 
On! My Mary Ann is an artizan, 
In a 
factory 'way down town, 
She makes umbrellas for the high-toned fellers, 
And she lives six stories from the ground, 
In a 
brick tenement, where they cut up devilment 
Every night in the week and every day. 
My sweet Mary Ann walks out upon the sand, 
Ev'ry summer at llockway. 
Her big brother Dan is a 
laboring man, 
On the pipes he's a 
civil engineer, 
His feet are as large as a 
picnic barge, 
He wears gum drops in his ears, 
He has a 
voice like a 
thrush, and he feeds on mush 
He's fond of his sister, they say. 
Sweet Mary Ann walks out upon the sand, 
With her big brother Dan at Rockaway 
Sweet Mary Ann plays the grand plan, 
She never studies notes from the book, 
The music clear lays all in her ear, 
As she rattles it off with her hands. 
Sundays nights, when the parlor's full, 
And dear Camelia May will you give me a 
welcome 
here ? 
Then sweet Mary Ann walks out upcn,the sand, 
Every summer on the beach at Rockaway. 
BABY MINE. 
Music of this song can be had of SPEAR & DERNHOTT, 717 
Broadway, N. Y. 
I'VE a 
letter from thy sire, 
Baby mine—baby mine;

He is sailing o'er the sea,

Baby .mine. 
Oh! I

Baby mine--h,aby mine, 
In his old accustomed place, 
Baby mine—baby mine. 
Like the rose of May in bloom, 
Like a 
star amid the gloom, 
Like the sunshine in the room, 
Baby mine—baby mine, 
Like the sunshine in the room, 
Baby mine. 
I'm so glad I 
cannot sleep, 
Baby mine—baby mine, 
I'm so happy I 
could weep, 
Baby mine—baby mine. 
He is sailing o'er the sea, 
lie is coming home to me. 
He is coming back to thee, 
Baby mine—baby mine, 
He is coming back to thee, 
Baby mine. 
THE DONKEY. 
Words and music by the late JAMES BRADLEY. As sung with 
great success all over the country by Tim ROGERS. 
I'VE got a 
donkey, he stands six foot high, 
I'll sell to the man that wishes to buy, 
He drinks Seltzer water whenever he's dry, 
In a 
race on the turf he has never proved shr, 
He makes good time, about one mile a 
day, 
I'll match him again any stallion or bay; 
lie fought for his country, he's been through the 
war, 
I 
feed him on herrings, hay-rope and tar. 
Chorus. 
I've got a 
donkey, he's not very chunky, 
I'll trade for a 
monkey, to any old flunkey, 
Now wouldn't that be hunky if he had my donkey, 
And I 
had his monkey, my donkey also? 
If he's locked in the stable he'll make a 
stiff kick, 
If lie wants to get out he'll pretend he is sick; 
I 
call out my donkey—his name it is Dick, 
I 
coax him along with a 
hickory stick. 
If I 
leave in his box a 
big bale of hay, 
He'll eat it all up and leave none for next day, 
Last week he broke loose and he got astray, 
lie was found in a 
sewer in Avenue A. 
I've got a 
donkey, etc. 
I 
harntinsect him up last St. Patrick's day, 
I 
rode on his back so cheerful and gay, 
We started from the corner of Tenth and Broad-
way, 
We rode to the hall without any delay; 
Just as we were passing by Central Park, 
A 
boy fired a 
pistol off, just for a 
lark, 
The donkey fell down which caused a 
blockade, 
Only for fifty horse-doctors he'd spoil the parade. 
I've got 4 donkey, ete, 
Sung with great success, by WILD & BRADLEY, of Theatre 
Comique, 514 Broadway, N. V. 
I'm a 
widow with a 
large family, 
My husband was killed in the war; 
He enlisted one day for a 
soldger, 
Faith, they murdered my darling agra ; 
From the government I 
receive a 
small pension 
Which all my family does share ; 
Faith, it ain't enough to maintain us, 
For I 
have to sell apples and pears. 
If I 
was a 
man I 
could labor, 
Sure, what can a 
poor woman do; 
I 
can't stand all day at the wash-tub! 
The reason I'll now tell to you ; 
I'm troubled with the rheumaticks, 
And to put up with many's the cares, 
And that's the reason you see me 
Out here, selling apples apples and pears. 
There's a 
great many men I 
could marry— 
There's Dennis McCarthy, so fat ! 
There's Patsy Marley, a 
sound boy! 
Faith, he is a 
good Democrat ! 
But they all do object to the children; 
To marry me, not one of them cares; 
So I'll let them all go to the divil, 
And stick to my apples and pears. 
Written by EDWARD HARRIGAN: 
Sung by Joitxxv ROACH, with great success. 
The young men's soeial club, 
They gave a 
grand excursion ; 
They had a 
band 
From Manahan, 
Two barges and a 
boat. 
The lads were titivated ; 
Yes, fit for sweet diversion. 
I'd Kitty McGlinn 
Away from home 
in a 
linen overcoat. 
CHORUS 
She played the concertina. 
As through the woods we rove ; 
I 
was all alone with Kitty McGlinn 
Up at Dudley's Grove. 
I 
danced in every set: 
In the waltz how gay I'd wheel her, 
No pivoter could equal her, 
A 
darling and a 
dear; 
A 
nd as we'd spin around 
They'd say, " A 
in't she a 
speeler !" 
Then I'd ta-ta up to the bar 
For a 
schooner of German hear. 
She played etc. 
You'd ought to hear her sing, 
Like a 
barber shop canary ! 
I 
hate to tell just like a 
lell 
she'd reach the upper C. 
Ballads are her style ; 
Like my own, my bonny Mary, 
She's a 
duck, and I'm in luck 
She's the lass that captured me. 
She played the, etc.

This book constitutes a 
second series of McBride's Comic Dialogues, and 
affords an additional variety of the spirited dialogues and short dramatic 
scenes contained in the latter book. They are all entirely original, and develop 
in a 
marked degree the eccentricities and peculiarities of the various ideal, but 
genuine characters which are represented in them. They are specially adapted 
for School Exhibitions and all other celebrations where the success of the en-
tcrtainuient is partly or entirely dependent on the efforts of the young folks.
