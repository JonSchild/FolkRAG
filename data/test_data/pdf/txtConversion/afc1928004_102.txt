KELLY & LEON'S 
'CHING-CHOW-HE' 
SONGSTER 
KELLY AND LEON. 
THE talents of the two renowned American Comedians, K ELLY and 
Lox, are varied and striking enough to keep their audiences in good 
humor, without the addition of the new piece. 
Mr. Edwin Kelly is a 
really accomplished Vocalist, Comic Actor and Mime,' whose abili-
ties, if exerted in logitimate drama would entitle him to take high 
rank as a 
comedian of the Mathews' and Yates' School. Leon is a 
still 
more extraordinary performer, whose peculiar and remarkable male 
soprano voice induces him to assume the " crinoline," in -which his 
apt impersonations are only rescued by the assumption of burlesque, 
from being too natural and life- like. 
ills characteristic sketch of 
"Saucy Sal," a Mississippi steamboat negress, is a piece of acting 
worthy of the first low comedian of the day ; in fact, in a 
variety ot 
forms these really clever actors make one regret that any disguise, 
however popular, should binder them from taking rank on an- stage 
where genuine humor and comic talent of the highest order might find 
a 
place.—[London Standard. 
K ELLY AND LEON'S MINSTRELS.—Of all the Minstrel Troupes now per-
forming in this city, this one alone has any claim upon the musical 
ear. 
Its instrumental and vocal music is far better than is ordinarily 
offered by the negro bands, and the singers and performers have claim 
to the name of Artists, as is perhaps shown in their constant produc-
tion of nerve and Offenbach. 
Leon whose wench business is in some 
respects remarkable, by no means furnishes all the humor of the eve-
ning. 
Mr. Kelly himself, is a 
Balladist of much talent, and has long 
been a favorite with all who admire the quaint and often tender 
pathos of many of the better class of Negro Melodies.-- IN. Y. Trorld, 
March 24, 1870.

POPSY WOPSY. 
Words by Miss A. A LEXANDER. 
Music by PAUL RtrrEn. 
(The music of this song is published by A. 
W UNDERMANN, Music Pub-
lisher 
669 Broadway. Price 35 Cents.) 
I 
am aq 'elpless female, 
An unprotected female, 
My husband's been and gone 
And run away my heart to wring, 
He's gone to join the Mormons, 
Those iray and festive Mormons, 
And while he's getting married there 
I'm left alone to sing. 
CHORUS. 
0 my Popsy Wopsy's vanished from my sight 
And we might have been so happy, so we might ; 
But now he's gone away to be a 
Mennonite, 
Arid I've no doubt but what he has a 
dozen wives 
or more. 
[Dances.] 
He bad a winning manner, 
A most engagin4 manner, 
And when we wed I 
never thought 
He'd come to serve me so, 
But he was so deceitful, 
The men are all deceitful, 
They bring poor girls like me to grief 
And that's as well to know. 
0 my Popsy Wopsy's &c. 
But I 
mean to go and join him, 
Go on the sly and join him, 
Just drop upon him unawares 
And end at once his fun. 
As soon as I 
can reach him 
The fact I 
mean to teach him, 
Though he may have a 
dozen wives 
Still I 
am Number One. 
0 my Popsy Wopsy, &c. 
Now ladies, take a 
warning, 
Let my fate be a 
warning, 
The men are all a 
sort of kind 
Of Bluebeard and not true, 
But if they will neglect us, 
To love they can't expect us, 
Fur what is sauce for goose you know, 
Is sauce for gander too. 
0 my Popsy Wopsfs, &c.

WEE SNOW WHITE. 
Sung by the author, Mr. LAWRENCE G RAHAM, 1st Baritone of Kelly & 
Leon's 'minstrels. 
Her face was as fair as the tracks of the snow, 
That lie ' neath a 
moons pale beam; 
And her spirit as calm as lillies grow. 
By the margin of man- ions streams. 
Not a 
hawthorn spray, in the woods of May, 
But were dimin'd by at brow more bright. 
And so softly she shone in this world's rough way, 
That I 
called her my Wee Snow White. 
That I 
called her my Wee Snow White, 
And so softly she shone on this world's rough way, 
That I 
called her my Wee Snow White. 
CHORUS. 
Wee Snow White, with a 
raiment light, 
And a 
face as fair as May; 
Shone for a 
space like all things bright, 
And faded then away. 
But the flakes that were light as her fairy feet, 
And the snow that was fair as she, 
Were cruel alas to my snow-drop sweet, 
And bore her away from me. 
She droop'd and she passed with the wintry blast, 
Like the dream of a 
lost delight, 
And left but the memory, love at last 
In my heart, of my Wee Snow White, 
In my heart, of my Wee Snow White 
And left hut the memory, love at last, 
In my heart of my Wee Snow White.

The soft dew is sleeping, 
The young buds are peeping, 
The sunbeams are dancing, o'er blossom and tree; 
But spring time returning, 
Is far colder burning, 
Than I 
my dear Marian, to come back to thee. 
And now that we're meeting, 
Your heart near me beating, 
It's little we'll think of the past that has flown; 
For your bloom that has faded, 
Your heart that was shaded, 
Will yet, like the flowr's, have a 
spring of their own.. 
The soft dew is sleeping, 
The young buds are peeping, 
The sunbeams are dancing o'er blossom -and tree; 
But spring-time returning,

In the moment of sorrow, 
When dark seem'd the morrow, 
I 
left thee and home to the Western Isle fam'd, 
But cold is the pleasure, 
The' bright be the treasure, 
When thinking to gain it we leave our dear land; 
But I 
told you when leaving, 
I'd nc'er be deceiving, 
That I'd never forget you, what e'er I 
might see; 
So I 
toil'd then with pleasure, 
But the best smiling treasure 
Is that which I 
gain now I've come back to thee.

Where is now the merry party,

Brightened by its ruddy glow;

They are all dispersed, and wandered'. 
Far away! far away 
Some have gone to lands far distant, 
And with strangers made their home.; 
some upon the world, of waters

There are still some few remaining, 
'Woo remind us of the past; 
But they change as all things change here, 
Nothing in this world can last:

Ere this closes--many may be

love a 
valiant soldier bold, 
Nineteen years old, with plenty of gold. 
On his dress, and if the truth he's told 
He's awful fond of me. 
The one that I 
love his name is Sam. 
Such a 
darling is Sam, without any cram; 
I 
like him far better than raspberry jam, 
For his like yet I 
never did see. 
cuonusb 
0, sha'n't I 
be glad when Sammy comes home, 
When Sammy comes home, when Sammy comes home, 
Oh sha'n't I 
be glad when Sammy comes home, 
When Sammy comes home in the morning. 
He wears a 
red coat and a 
sword by his sicle, 
With spurs on his heels and long whiskers 'aeside, 
And sometimes has a 
big horse for to ride, 
0 
don't he look martial and grand. 
On the top of his hat a 
feather there grows, 
Put there I 
suprose to show how the wind blows, 
is hair is Magenta, and so is his nose; 
With the handsomest form in the land. 
0, sha'n't I 
be glad, &e. 
My Sammy has travelled to many a 
shore, 
Where the elephants fly and the crocodiles roar, 
And, oh, should he never come back any more, 
For my Sammy ra die in .despair. 
No one could imagine what he has gone thro', 
lie can talk foreign languages until all is blue; 
Trench, Dutch, Spanish, Persian, and Irish, too, 
To hear him would make you all stare, 
0 
sha'n't I 
be glad, eco. 
1 
shall never forget when he told me his love, 
And vowed by 
ll the stars above, 
And squeezed my poor fingers as well as my glove, 
I 
believed every word that be said. 
But, oh, when he said that abroad he must hie, 
And wished me good-bye, I 
thought I 
should die, 
So I 
sat myself down and had a 
good cry • 
For without him I'd surely be dead. 
Oh, sha'n't I 
be glad, i&c. 
ENOCH ARDE.N. 
Cheer up, Annie darling, with hopeful emotion, 
To-morrow our parting must be; 
I'll sail the seas over, I'll cross the wide ocean, 
I'll sail the seas over for thee; 
I'll not forget thee, oh! never, no never I 
I 
cannot forget thee, I 
know: 
Thy smile, like a 
phantom, will haunt me foreveu 
And cheer me where'er I 
may go. 
CHORUS. 
Good-by, Annie, darling I 
I'll sail o'er the sea,

I'll cross the wide ocean for thee. 
I 
go, Annie darling, but leave thee in sorrow; 
I 
go for thy sake far away, 
Then bid me good-bye, with a 
smile on the morrow, 
And cheer me with blessings I 
pray. 
I'll think of thee ever, and pray for thee, 
As over the waters I 
roam; 
I'll tarry not darling, and leave thee all lonely, 
But hasten again to my home. 
Good-bye, Annie, darling, &c. 
Out, out on the ocean, away o'er the billow, 
My heart on its purpose intent, 
My brow shall find rest, when I 
seek my lone pillow, 
In knowing that thou art content. 
Cheer up, Annie, darling, break off from thy sorrow: 
'Tis sad that our parting must be: 
But give me thy smile, when I 
leave thee, to-morrow, 
To sail the seas over for thee. 
Good-bye, Annie, darling, are.

Oh, Birdie, I am tired now, 
L 
do not care to hear you sing: 
You've sung your happy songs all day, 
Now put your head beneath your wing. 
I'm sleepy, too, as I 
can be, 
And sister, when my prayer is said 
I 
want to lay me down to rest, 
So put me in my little bed. 
Oh. sister, what did mother say, 
When she was called to heaven away? 
She told me always to be good, 
And never, never, go astray ; 
I 
can't forget the day she died, 
She placed her hand upon my head. 
She whisper'd soLly, " keep my child," 
And then they told me she was dead.

But all in vain for me ; 
But all in vain for me. 
I 
count the weary hours, and sigh; 
A-far thy footsteps rove, 
While summer days are passing by, 
Oh ! come again, sweet love ; 
While summer days are passing by, 
Oh ! c,nne again, sweet love. 
I 
see thy face in every flow'r, 
Thy name is on the breeze; 
I 
live again the parting hour 
That bore thee o'er the seas: 
That bore thee o'er the seas; 
Then wander back unto thy nest, 
Thou truant weary dove; 
My heart shall be thy home of rest: 
Oh! come again, sweet love; 
My heart shall be thy home of rest.' 
Oh ! come again, sweet love.

CLEMENTINA."—[CoNcLuDED.] 
She asked me in such winning tones 
I'd not the heart to tell her no, 
I 
followed Wilhelmina 
And up-stairs I 
did go. 
I'd fallen dreadfully in love with her, 
It made me wild to see 
That she spoke to all the passers-by 
As she had done to me. 
Oh, Clementina I 
Wilhelmina I &re 
I 
used to call there twice a 
week, 
And wasted many afternoons 
In eating shrimps and drinking tea, 
(A dreadful case of spoons): 
One day I 
gorgeously arrayed myself, 
In splendid garments new, 
Resolved I'd ask for the hand and heart 
Of her I 
loved at Kew. 
Oh, Clementina I 
Wilhelminal &c. 
I 
reached the cottage-door, but found 
No lovely Wilhelmina there ; 
What did it mean! where could she be! 
'Twas more than I 
could bear;, 
I 
asked imploringly where she had gone, 
Alas! I 
heard them say, 
She has married George, the waiter, and 
Now lives over the way. 
Oh, Clementina! Wilhelmina I &re. 
I 
fled in anguish from the spot, 
With loud and dismal wailing cries, 
And now I 
never see a 
shrimp 
But tears come in my eyes: 
My dreadful history— although 'tis sad— 
A 
moral p'rhaps may teach: 
Beware of pretty little girls, and tea 
And shrimps at ninepence each. 
Oh, Clementina! Wilhelmina!

FINE OLD ENGLISH GENTLEMAN. 
I'll sing you a 
good old song, made by a 
good old pate, 
Of a 
fine old English gentleman, who had an old estate ; 
And who kept up his old mansion at a 
bountiful old rate, 
With a 
good old porter to relieve the old poor at his gate. 
Like a 
fine old English gentleman, all of the olden time. 
His hall, so old, was hung around with pikes and guns and bows, 
And swords and good old bucklers, which had stood against old Pies, 
And ' twas there " his worship" sat in state, in doublet and trunk hose, 
And quatl'd his cup of good old sack to warm his good old nose. 
Like a 
fine old, & c. 
When winter old, brought frost and cold, he opened house to all, 
And though threescore and ten his years, he featly led the ball ; 
Nor was the houseless wanderer ever driven from his hall, 
For while he feasted all the great ho ne'er forgot the small. 
Like a 
fine old, It:c. 
Bat time, though old, is strong in flight, and years rolled swiftly by, 
And autumn's falling leaf proclaimed, the old man—he must die! 
He laid him own right tranquilly, gave up life's latest sigh, 
A 
nd mournful friends stood round his conch, and tears bedim'd each eye. 
For a 
flue old, &e.

I'm as jolly as they make 'cm, 
In that place of education, 
'With a

A

With a

Champagne or Eau de Vie, 
For a 
student's life it is so very jolly. 
When a

And a 
round or two demands, 
My left bunch I 
gracefully put forward; 
He'll receive it with a

Fairly planted on his nob, 
No trifling with the festive lads of Harvard. 
The girls,they love us all,

And lay your brown head on my breast,

Your hands are as fair as the lilies, 
That blossom in the shadows of green, 
And their touch has magical power, 
My heart from all sadness to wean.

Oh ! what could be sweeter than dreaming 
This dream that is on us to-night ? 
Let us think of the present, my darling, 
The future is out of our sight. 
Come sit by my side, &c. 
Sing low in the twilight some ballad, 
As sweet as the smile on your face, 
That shall thrill me with melody's sweetness, 
And touch with its words tender grace. 
And I'll give you a 
kiss when it's ended, 
A 
kiss that the singer shall earn, 
And perhaps, do you hear, little darling ? 
I 
shall ask for a 
kiss in return.

RIDING ON A STEAMBOAT. 
As Sung in " SINBAD " by Misses M ARKHAM, DESMOND & ECAMMIliet. 
0, riding on a 
steamboat is just the thing for me, 
At least upon the river and not upon the sea; 
All up the lovely Hudson, or down the rippling bay,

advise you to spend a 
happy day I 
CHORUS. 
Now, then, gentlemen, there's the bell again, 
Look alive, my swell tip-toppers, 
Steam is up, and we must go; 
Now, then, gentlemen, there's the bell again, 
Riding on a 
steamboat is so nice, you know! 
Of all that leaves the harbor, I 
love the Bristol line, 
For there's a 
band of music a-playing so divine; 
And as they're tootle-tooing„ you gaze upon the tide, 
Or promenade the deck with the loy'd one by your side. 
Now, then, a:c. 
And then there are the staterooms, just seven feet by four, 
But why they are called state-rooms, it puzzles me full sore; 
They're just as comfortable as are the sleeping cars,

COME DOWN, DARLING, DO. 
As sung in " SINDBAD" by M R. DE SOLLA.:: 
The day-light, love, is dying, 
The soft low wind is sighing, 
And the veil-like clouds are flying, 
A-cross the sky's dark blue. 
Fear not to ope thy lattice, 
No one is nigh to hear thee, 
Only I, my love, am near thee, 
Then come down, darling do: 
Thy curtain moven' lightly, 
And there an arm is gleaming, 
And if I 
be not dreaming, 
'Tis thine and thine alone: 
And there an eye is beaming, 
Than stars more true and tender, 
h ! in ail thy maiden splendor, 
Come Quu(n, unto thy ilir:fle! 
TICE I.X.ION BURLESQUE SONG. 
A IR :—" Mabel Waltz." 
How doth the little busy bee, 
Delight to bark and bite, 
It gathers honey all the day, 
And eats it all at night. 
Three little boys went out to play, 
On a 
summer's day, 
One fell in and he was drowned, 
The others ran away. 
A 
boy stood on the burning deck, 
With his baggage checked for Troy, 
The ship went down and his hat blew off, 
And his name was Pat Molloy. 
Old Mother Hubbard went to the cupboard, 
To get her poor dog a 
bone. 
When she got there, the cupboard was bare, 
And so the poor dog got none. 
If I 
see you and you see me, 
We both see one another, 
If I 
didn't see you and you didn't see me, 
We wouldn't see one another. 
A hunky boy is U. S. G., 
But this it is a 
shame, 
That Johnny Bull does not come down, 
With the Alabama claims. 
Supposing now that I 
was you, 
Supposing you were me, 
Supposing I 
was somebody else, 
I 
wonder whose brother you'd be. 
Hey diddle diddle, the cat and the fiddle, 
The cow jumped over the moon, 
The little dog laughed to see such sport, 
And the cat ran,away ‘vith the spoon.

CHICE.ABIDDY; OR, GOOD-BYE, JOHN. 
'Twas on a 
Friday morning I— 
Bid New York town, good bye. 
The wind it blow d 
great guns, my boys. 
And the waters ran sky high, 
As I 
waved my new bandana to 
My Nancy on the shore, 
She sobb d 
and sigh'd, and wept and cried— 
When I 
sailed for Singapore. 
Spoken — Aye, lads, and weepingly she cried, 
C11011CS. 
Good bye. John, now don't stop long, 
But come back soon to your own Chickabiddy, 
For my heart beats so, when the winds do blow 
That takes away my sailor. 
Sweet Nancy was a 
lass, my boys, 
Ot fifteen stone full weight. 
Her face—it was a 
face, my boys, 
Like a 
good sized dinner plate; 
She kept a 
candy-shop, my boys, 
'Iwould your eyes do good to see, 
Sold loliypops, and Tom Thumb's drops, 
Bat nought so swt et as she. 
Spoken.— And her last words were 
Good bye, John, tViz., 
When I 
sail d 
for foreign parts I'd bring, 
Back presents to my love, 
Such as lnjin hats and Turkish mats, 
Or a

Sweet Nance would write me billet doos, 
Which took away my breath, 
And said as how she " by d

Good bye, John, &e. 
One night I 
had a 
dream, my boys. 
That Nance appeared to me, 
She look'd like a mermaid, boys, 
That floats about the sea; 
She wagg'd her tail at me, my boys! 
And then she shook her head, 
Then seemed to speak in fishy tones 
And this is what she said, 
Good bye, John, cto. 
Our gc.11ant craft reacli'd home, my boys. 
Next day to conic On board, 
My Nance put off in a 
boat to meet 
Her John whom she ador'd. 
When, mess:mates—hard the tale to tell 
She swerved 1 
the boat capsized! 
Down, down to the bottom went sweet Nance, 
The girl I 
dearly priz'ti— 
Spoken.—Aye, lads, there struggling in the embrace of the 
briny Hudson I 
beheld my own sweet Nance—and was I, a 
Yankee sailor, to stand by and see a 
Yankee female—and that 
female a 
woman in distress? 
No! to shiver my timbers, take 
a 
reef out of my slacks, and the quid out of my month was 
hut the work of three quarters ot an hour, and overboard I 
dived—when huzza! just as she was sinking for the thirtieth 
time I 
grasped her by the hair— the locks I 
loved so dear— 
saved ! savod 
I 
cried, when horror ! her hair come off! 
She 
never told me that she wore a 
wig—and down she went pug 
ling the words I 
hear the very wind that blows, 
Good bye, John, &c.

What if a

She came and vanished like a

Of rarest fancies born ; 
A dream that blesses sleep, but leaves

She gently passed away.

Of rarest fancies born ; 
A 
dream that blesseth sleep, but leaves 
The waking sense forlorn. 
Though cold and bleak the winds of March 
Swept over vale and hill, 
Yet sweetest song-birds twAt'ring came 
Around lier window-sill ! 
Bright messengers, they seemed to wait, 
That loved one's latest sigh. 
As though to waft on seraph wings 
Her spirit to the sky. 
She came and vanished, &c. 
Oft-times a 
dream is in my heart 
Whose pulses own its sway: 
E'en as a 
lute's responsive chords 
The minstrel's hand obey; 
She meets my gaze, that fair lost child, 
Her fingers clasp my own, 
Till, with a 
start, I 
w 
ace to weep, 
And find myself alDne. 
She came, and vanished, &c.

Down the stream we gaily float, 
While stars are shining bright, 
And swift as sea-gulls on the wing, 
We skim the wave to-night ! 
To music's chime we're keeping time, 
Our hearts are bold and free; 
Our home is on the waters wide, 
And merry birds are we!

The stars are dancing at our prow, 
And day but makes them dim.

We banish thoughts of pain; 
With love and pride we sail the deep, 
And hope to sail again!

The stars are paling now! 
And see! the spray—a 
silver shower, 
We scatter from our prow!

In the spring-time of life, Lai 
yes, onward we glide, 
With a 
clear stream beneath and a 
full swinging tide, 
Never heeding the ripples that pass by our side, 
Nor into the depths even peep. 
With success at the helm, then 'tis pleasure to row, 
While all things with us and the tide seem to go 
So smoothly along o'er the clear stream below, 
Though quicksands beneath us, beneath us may leap, 
We east, then, around us wit's keen piercing shaft, 
All's taut in life's frail bark, tho wind's fair abaft, 
While we gaze with delight on our neat trim-built craft, 
Nor dream that still waters, still waters run deep. 
CHORUS. 
In the springtime of life, ah I 
yes, onward we glide, 
"With a 
clear stream beneath and a 
full swinging tide, 
Never heeding the ripples that pass by our side, 
Nor dream that still waters, still waters run deep. 
In the hey-day of life, when with ardor we burn, 
Unobserved by ourselves oft the tide 'gins to turn, 
Alt I 
then at some cost 'tis too often we learn, 
As ago slowly on its doth creep, 
Our bark on its voyage should be well stored in youth, 
With a 
compass to steer by, whose pole should be truth, 
With white sails of wisdom well-trimm'd, then forsooth, 
And look-out ahead, yes, ahead we must keep. 
The God then above us our pilot will be, 
'With faith our sheet-anchor we'll venture to sea, 
Though the voyage may be long, safe in port we shall be 
If we mind that still waters, still waters run deep. 
In the spring- time of life. &c.

THE YALLER GAL THAT *WINKED AT ME. 
Music by 11. A. Elaaxi.Nnts.z. 
Your attention I 
ask for a 
while, 
To a 
song I'm going to sing you, 
Its about a 
pretty yaller gal I 
met while I 
was walking, 
And she threw such a 
glance at me— 
She was pretty and as sweet as a 
flower, 
Such clothes you never did see— 
She'd a 
darling little bonnet with a 
flower-garden on it, 
Had the yaller gal that winked at me. 
CHORUS. 
Oh my! she looked so sweet and she dressed so neat, 
With her tilting-hoops and pretty little feet, 
A., she went skipping along. 
Pretty little yaller gal I 
met while I 
was walking, 
As she skipped across the gutter, my heart went in a 
flutter, 
For the yaller gal that winked at me. 
I 
immediately asked her name, 
And she said it was Lucinda 
She said I 
was a 
stunner, and for life that I 
had won her. 
And married we should be. 
So, I'd dress up, and I'd walk by her house, 
Every afternoon, about three, 
And I'd glance up at the window for to see my dear Lucinda, 
She's the yaller gal that winked me. 
Oh my! she looked, &:c. 
Oh! you should have seen her, on her wedding day— 
She was handsome as a 
Venus— 
When the Parson made us one, ah then the thing was done, 
And I 
never felt so happy in my 
life. 
So, I've bought a 
little place out of town— 
If you go by, stop in and see— 
You'll be welcomed by a 
wife that's as dear to me as life, 
She's the yaller gal that winked at me. 
Oh my 1 
she looked, &e.

BATTY AVOURNEEN. 
'Twas a 
cold winter's night and the tempest was snarlin', 
The snow like a 
sheet covered cabin and stye, 
When Barney flew over the hills to his darlin', 
And tapped at the window where Katty did lie. 
" Arrah, jewel," said he, are ye sleepin' or wakin' ? 
The night's bitter cold, an' my coat it is thin ; 
Oh, the storm ' tis a 
brewin', the frost it is bakin', 
Oh, Katty Avourneen, you must let Inc in. 
Arrah, Barney, cried she, and she spoke thro' the window, 
Ah, would ye be takin' me out of my bed ? 
To come at this time it's a 
shame and a 
sin, too; 
It's whiskey, not love, that's got into your head. 
If your heart it was true, of my fame you'd be tender; 
Consider the time and there's nobody in, 
Oh, what has a 
poor girl but her name to defend her; 
No, Barney Avourneen, I 
won't let you in. 
Ah, cushla, cried he, it's my heart is a 
fountain 
That weeps for the wrong I 
might lay at your door; 
Your name is more white than the snow on the mountain 
And Barney would die to preserve it as pure; 
I'll go to my home, though the winter winds face me, 
I'll whistle them off, for I'm happy within; 
An' the words of my Kathleen will comfort and bless me: 
Oh, Barney Avourneen, I 
won't let you in 
HER BRIGHT SMILE HAUNTS ME STILL 
'Tis years since last we met, and we may not meet again; 
I 
have struggled to forget, but that struggle was in vain. 
For, her voice lives on the breeze, and her spirit comes at will; 
In the midnight on tit._ ...
as, her bright smile haunts me still. 
At the first sweet dawn of light, when I 
gaze upon the deep, 
Her form still greets my sight, while the stars their vigils 
keep. 
When I 
close mine aching eyes, sweet dreams my senses fill; 
And, from sleep when I 
arise, her bright smile haunts me still. 
I 
have sailed 'neath alien skies, I 
have trod the desert path; 
I 
have seen the storm arise like a 
giant in his wrath. 
Every danger I 
have known, that a 
reckless life can fill ; 
Yet her presence is not flown, her bright smile haunts me still. 
LITTLE MAGGIE MAY. 
1 
The Spring had come, the flowers in bloom, 
The birds sung out their lay; 
Down by a 
little running brook, 
I 
first saw Maggie May: 
She had a 
roguish jet-
black eye, 
Was singing all the day: 
And how I 
loved her 
none can tell, 
My little Maggie May. 
CHORUS. 
My little witching Maggie, 
Maggie singing all the day. 
Oh how I 
love her 
none can tell, 
My little Maggie May. 
Though years rolled on, yet still I 
loved 
With heart so light and gay, 
And never will this heart deceive 
My own dear Maggie May. 
When others thought that life was gone 
And death would take away, 
Still by my side did linger one. 
And that was Maggie May. 
My little witching, &c. 
May Heaven protect me for her sake: 
I 
pray, both night and day, 
That I 
ere long may call her mine, 
My own dear Maggie May. 
For, she is all the world to me, 
Although Pin far away : 
I 
oftimes think of the running brook, 
And my little Maggie May. 
My little witching, &e.

LITTLE BROWN JUG. 
W ords by GEORGE COOPER. 
Music by W. F. W ELLMAN. 
They talk of their wine and their goblets of gold, 
That sparkle in beauty and splendor untold; 
There's very good cheer in the draught I 
will own, 
But little to please us when weary we've grown. 
Oh, dear to my heart, yes, far dearer to me, 
Than wealth of the Indies, or gems of the sea, 
This rough-looking friend; out of clay he was dug, 
The pride of my bosom, my little brown jug. 
CHORUS. 
The little brown jug the little brown jug! 
0, sweet is a 
sup from the little brown jug. 
His face it is tanned with the heat of the sun, 
He's always a 
welcome of rollicking fun; 
Whatever the liquor that flows to this brim, 
It makes little difference to me or to him. 
But strangest of all, while together we pull, 
He's sure to be empty, I'm sure to be full. 
I 
ne'er had a 
wife, and so closely I'll hug, 
Thy form to my bosom, my little brown jug. 
The little brown jug, &c. 
We've journeyed together for many a 
day, 
And dear is our friendship as flowers of May. 
We both have grown older, but little I 
care, 
So long as they leave me his welcome to share. 
Thy features, old comrade, have many a 
scar, 
Once almost as bright as the moon or a 
star, 
But fondly togeth( r 
still onward we'll tug. 
My true friend, my dear friend, my little brown jug. 
The little brown jug, &c.

His first

"Agnes May," and " Star of the Evening." All of these songs Went 
successful, and then followed a 
delicious tide of pure and beautif 
that calminated in that outbreak of a 
Nation's hopes m. 1 
fears—tho aniversally popular, `• When this cruel war is over.' 
As f•r 
popnlarity and simplicity and correctness of style are concerned, 
Henry Tucker stands to-day highest among our native composers. In 
charaezer he is a 
kind, genial gentleman—the idol of his many friends. 
His Lame ; s 
a 
synonym. of all that is agreeable in social intercourse. 
In fact, Henry Tucker —with story—hi

circles. 
Tiis latest composition, ' Sweet Genevieve,' shows that his 
Lyre has net yet lost its wonderons charm, lie is at present engaged

Arabic expression, may henry Tucker's " shadow never grow less," 
bat may the world still be charmed by his heart-moving melodies-I 
0, Genevieve, I'd give the world, 
To live arrain the lovely past; 
Tho rose of youth was dew impearll, 
But now it withers in the blast. 
I 
see thy face in every dream, 
My waking thoughts are full of thee; 
Thy glance is in the starry beam, 
that falls aloag the summer sea.

My heart shall never, never rove. 
Thou art my only guiding star, 
For me the past has 110 regret,

I 
bless the hour when first we net.

THE MERRIEST GIRL THAT'S OUT. 
With laughter and good humor, why, 
I 
pass my time away, 
So, while 
here 1'11 do my best 
To please you with my lay. 
Then, come along and join my song, 
And raise a 
merry shout, 
To welcome me: for, I'm you see, 
The merriest girl that's out. 
CHORUS. 
Now then, young men, 
Don't be melancholy: 
Just see, like me 
If you can't be jolly. 
If any thing goes wrong with mo, 
I 
never sulk or pout: 
In fact, I 
am, and always was, 
The merriest girl that's out 
The gentlemen complain and say; 
I'm such a 
dreadful flirt: 
But if they will make love to me, 
Their hearth I'm sure to hurt— 
I 
really can't help laughing, 
When I 
hear them sigh about; 
For sentiment it don't suit me; 
I'm the merriest girl that's out. 
Now then, &c. 
The notes and presents I 
receive, 
Would fill a 
basket quite, 
While bouquets rare, I 
do declare, 
Are sent me every night. 
The notes all speak of broken hearts: 
Some mean it, I've no doubt; 
I'm sorry: yet I 
still remain 
The merriest girl that's out, 
Now, then, &G. 
To 
balls and parties I 
oft go: 
For, dancing I 
admire, 
And waltzing is a 
thing, I 
own, 
Of which I 
never tire; 
And should my partner squeeze my hand, 
I 
know what l'm about: 
It 
pleases him, and don't hurt me: 
I'm the merriest girl that's out. 
Now then, &a-
THE GRECIAN BEND. 
As sung by the GREAT LINGARD. 
Good evening to you one and all, 
I 
hope I 
don't intrude, 
Dressed in this quiet fashion, 
Pray do not think me rude. 
I 
always study " Le Follet," 
The fashion to amend; 
So I 
introduce you, ladies, too, 
This graceful Grecian Bend. 
CHORUS. 
The Grecian Bend, as I 
now show, 
You must admit is all the go. 
The head well forward, and the bouy you extend, 
To be perfect in the Grecian Bend. 
'Twas raining hard the other day, 
So I 
got into a 
stage, 
Some little boys began to shout, 
Which put me in a 
rage. 
The driver, too, said, " Really, Miss, 
You've room enough for ten," 
And actually charged me double, 
On account of my Grecian Bend. 
SPOKEN :—I 
wouldn't mind it so much only there was Ann 
Jenkins, who lives next door to me, in the same stage, she began 
to laugh at me, she's been practicing the Grecian Bend for 
three weeks, but she can't do it, she's jealous of me because I 
took her young man away. 
One gent had the audacity to tell 
me that the Creel.n Bend was nothing more or less than a 
spasmodic movement of the third rib in connection with the, 
left shoulder. 
In fact I 
need not tell you that— 
The Grecian Bend, cte.

THE GIRL OF THE PERIOD.--LCoNcLutED.1 
We pride ourselves on fine chignon, 
And charming style of hat; 
Which those strange men may smile upon, 
But we don't care much for that: 
We make " la mode" our study, 
Are first in fashion's field; 
And, 'spite the men, we'll so remain, 
And sooner die than yield. 
A 
Girl of the Period, &c. 
Our style attracts attention as 
We promenade the Park; 
Men tremble when they meet ua 
At Soirees after dark: 
We handle well the ribbons, 
When out upon a 
drive, 
And if you come to horsemanship, 
The odds are twelve to five— On us, of rf»tr.x. 
A 
Girl of the Period, 
When out upon the river, we 
Can show one how to row, 
Pace, forty strokes a 
minute,—now 
That's not so very slow! 
And when we do some billiards, 
We never play at 
pot," 
But " go in" for pretty cannons, or 
Score thirty off the spot. 
A 
Girl of the Period, &c. 
6. Let spiteful writers paint us black, 
And old maids have their say ;— 
The " Girl of the Period" 's 
no worse 
Than the " Young Man of the Day:" 
There may be faults to find with us, 
But the young men are to blame ;— 
Dress as we will, we know that still 
They'll love us just the same.

THOU ART SO NEAR AND YET SO- FA-11. 
I 
know an eye so softly bright, 
That glistens like a 
star of night; 
My soul it draws, with glances kind, 
To heaven's blue vault, and there I 
find: 
_Another star as pure and clear 
As that which mildly sparkles here. 
Beloved eye, beloved star, 
Thou art so near, and yet so far 
Beloved eye, beloved star, 
Thou art so near, and yet so far 
That eye so soft, like violets blue, 
A 
treasure bears of morning dew;. 
And whoa its light entraned I 
see, 
What joy, what pain possesses me I 
A world, where I 
would gladly dwell, 
Is that bright orb I 
love so well. 
Beloved eye, beloved: star, 
If closed at last that radiant eye should be, 
No more the day will dawn for me ; 
If night should dim its laughing light, 
Oh: then, for ever ' twill be night 
Those eyes that brightly, softly shine, 
For me the sun and moon combine. 
Beloved eye, beloved star, it.

Of duty and of care, 
How sweet to know the lov'd ones, 
Await my coining there 
A sweet face at the window, 
A 
dear one at the door, 
A 
fair form at the gate-way, 
To greet me home once morel 
A sweet face at the window, 
Oh! how I 
long to be 
Within that little cottage, 
Where all are dear to me, 
Where fond hearts beat responsive 
To every wish of mine, 
And love, like gentle ivy, 
In fragrance round it twine! 
A 
sweet face, &r.. 
A 
sweet face at the window, 
A spirit bright and blest, 
That watches for my coming, 
More constant than the rest. 
And she will come to meet me, 
The first, outside the door: 
With her, so true and loving, 
I'll tarry evermore

WHEN I SAW SWEET NELLIE HOltia 
In the sky the bright stars glittered, 
On the grass the moonlight fell, 
Hushed the sound of daylight hustle, 
Closed the Pink-eyed Pimper nell.

From Aunt Dinah's quilting party, 
I

In the sky the bright stars glittered, 
On the grass the moonlight shone, 
From Aunt Dinah's quilting party, 
I 
was seeing Nellie home. 
When the Autumn tinged the greenwood, 
Turning all its leaves to gold, 
In the lawn by the elders shaded, 
I 
my love to Nellie told. 
On the star-bespangled dome, 
how I 
blessed the August evening, 
As we stood together gazing, 
When I

The stars put on a

The sad word was: Good-bye I

Oh I 
tell me that you love me yet, 
For, oh! the parting gives me pain, 
Say, tell me that you'll not forgets 
For, we may never meet again!

tear-drop trembled on your cheek, 
In vain to tell my love I 
tried, 
Zty heart was sad, I 
could not speak. 
I 
promised that I

I'll sing of pretty little Flora, the gem behind the bar, 
At a 
place near Harlem, you will find my guiding star, 
She is the sweetest treasure, all around near and far, 
And to speak the truth, I 
adore her! 
Swells flock like little flies around a 
treacle pot, 
And want to steal my fair one, but I 
don't care a 
jot. 
They talk and drink, just to look large, and fancy they'r A 1, 
But they have not half a 
chance with little Flora. 
CHORUS. 
Lisfning to the music up in Central Park, 
All among the crowd I 
met her; 
Flora was her name, my heart is in a 
flame, 
And I 
never, never, never can forget her! 
How I 
love little Flora, and for hours I 
would stand, 
The proudest of the proud, and the grandest of the grand, 
And soon I'll place the gold ring upon her tiny hand, 
Yet I 
keep my eye on all who stand before her; 
When swells they pass a 
joke, she says, 
Sir, don't be rude,' 
And putting on a 
frown, declares they very much intrude, 
Then, turning round, she looks at me, as much as just to say, 
Oh ! George, you have the heart of little Flora! 
List'ning to the music, &c. 
I 
could eat pretty Flora my love is so sincere, 
She wants no Bloom of Youth, her skin it is so fair, 
Her eyes are full of fire, she's a 
splendid head of hair, 
And in a 
brooch she carries me before her; 
We've named the happy day, so I'm right for life, 
If all is true as she says, she'll prove a 
charming wife, 
So am I 
not a 
lucky man, my rivals to defeat, 
And marry ray own charming little Flora ?

Mynheer Vandunck, though he never was drunk, 
Sipp'd brandy and water gaily, 
And lie quenched his thirst with two quarts of the first 
To a 
pint of the latter daily ; 
Singing, " 0 that a 
Dutchman's draught should be 
As deep as the rolling Zuyder Zee." 
Water well mingled with spirits good store, 
No Hollander dreams of scorning, 
But of water alone he drinks no more, 
That a 
rose supplies when a 
dewdrop lies 
On its bloom on a 
summer morning; 
For a 
Dutchman's draught should potent be, 
Though deep as the rolling Zuyder Zee. 
MY OWN, MY GUIDING STAR. 
Thy gentle voice would lead me on, 
My own, my guiding star— 
Till every sense of life were gone, 
E'en wert thou placed afar; 
And now thou deign'st so near to shine, 
With rays that warm and cheer, 
The firmest, surest hopes are mine; 
My 
soul is strange to fear. 
Thou need'st not doubt, thou need'st not grieve, 
I 
bear a 
potent spell, 
Be certain love will ne'er deceive 
The heart that serves him well ; 
I 
know my path will serve me right, 
With such a 
prize in view— 
Arid happy omens bless my sight 
That must and shall be true.

I 
love sweet Isabella. 
She loves another fellow. 
I 
often used to tell her, and stamp my umberella, 
If with another I 
caught her, I'd from this world transport her, 
Her life should be much shorter than sun on a 
rainy day. 
I 
longed for her my wife to be—through going to Paris, it wasn't 
to be; 
For when she sat on a 
Frenchman'n knee, it wasn't the cheese for 
me—oll! no! 
cinutt-s. 
Oh ! sweet Isabella! her voice so sweet and Mellow ! 
I 
caught her with a 
fellow, then, with my umberella, 
I 
fetched him such a 
smeller, and knocked him down the' cellar 
Because she loved this fellow, and she would not belong to me. 
By Marcus' Paris excursion, to spend a 
week's diversion, 
I 
now make the assertion, I 
took Miss Isabella. 
She wanted no persuasion, but got up for the occasion. 
We took ourselves from London Bridge, the Exhibition to see: 
Scarce had we arrived in France, things went wrong, I 
saw at a 
glance ; 
She was struck with men who could Parlez-vous France, and 
didn't care " that" for me—oh! no ! 
Oh I 
sweet Isabella, & c. 
The Exhibition compartments we viewed, then took apartments 
The top- most garret departments, the Royal Hotel Victoria. 
We dined off roasted puppy-dogs, snails, and beautiful stewed 
frogs; 
And 1“ ,\
-1.1' knew what we had eat till we found them moving 
here." 
SWEET ISABELLA.—LCONCLUDED.] 
She began to talk French to the Valet-de-Shong—perhaps about 
me— she was talking so long, 
Running me down, as she could speak the tongue ; of French 
not a 
word could I 
say—oh! no! 
Oh! sweet Isabella, & c. 
Isabella, you couldn't resist her; just here she raised a 
blister, 
When once for hours I 
missed her, and knew the Frenchman 
kissed her. 
One day, she thought me sleeping ; not me I 
for I 
was peeping-, 
And saw my foreign brother with his arms around her wait ; 
My blood was up—then, with one blow, down the cellar-steps I 
laid lam low— 
When she—with her hands—soon let me know she loved him 
better than me— all 1 
yes ! 
Oh ! sweet Isabella, ct:e. 
My feelings I 
could not smother—I 
came back to my mother; 
She said: George, try another—as they love one another ! 
In France they soon got married, in France they never tarried, 
But came to good old England, and opened a 
rasberry shop. 
So, if ever a 
rasberry ice you get, I 
hope, poor me 1 
you won't 
forget 
how the Frenchman my poor life upset, NV1I0 lives in the White. 
Chapel-road—uh! dear! 
CHORUS. 
Oh ! sweet Isabella ! I 
hope you'll le:o;e the fellow, 
With his rasberry ice so mellow, but with t1.1.3 umberella, 
T 
could give him another smeller, and send him down the cellar, 
Because 
she lies this, fellow, awl she NVOla 111•10112', to me.

LOVE AMONG THE ROSES. 
SONG AND DANCE. 
Words by W. FL D ELEHANTY. 
Music by E. N. CA.TM:ks. 
It was on one Summer's evening, 
In the merry mouth of June; 
I 
beheld a 
damsel sitting 
'Mid flowers' sweet perfume. 
She had a 
novel, reading, 
Just as I 
was passing by, 
And as she turned another page, 
I 
saw the brightest eye ; 
A bewitching smile was on her face. 
As charming as the posies: 
I 
felt the smart of Cupid's dart: 
'Twas love among the roses. 
enonus.—Now, I 
hate to tell, but then t 
must; 
Within her heart I 
place my trust; 
She was sitting in the garden, 
Where the little butterfly reposes: 
And how we met, I'll rui'er fin-get, 
'Twas love among the roses. 
I 
passed her house next evening, 
The clock had just struck eight, 
And I 
saw my future happiness; 
She was standing by the garden-gate. 
She smiled as I 
approached her, 
And I 
begged her to excuse ; 
May I 
view those pretty flowers ? 
She murmured: If you choose. 
I 
spoke about the violets, 
Then finally made proposes: 
Thro' the garden we walked, of happiness talked; 
'Twas love among the roses. 
Now, I 
hate to tell, (te. 
I 
confess I 
love Matilda; 
Matilda, that's her name; 
And there is a 
charm about her, 
Which I 
never can explain. 
She dresses up to fashion, 
To her style there is no end, 
And, of course, she must look dashing; 
For, she wears a 
Grecian Bend. 
But she's left her home, and where she's gone, 
Most every one supposes; 
For, as dear as life is my little wife: 
'Twos love among the roses. 
Now, I 
hate to tell, ti:e.

Sleeping I 
dreamed, love, dreamed, love, of thee : 
O'er the bright \vaVs , 
love, floating were we ; 
Light in thy fair hair played the soft wind, 
Gently thy white arms round me were twined ; 
And as thy song, love, swelled o'er the sea, 
Fondly thy blue eyes beamed love, on me. 
Soon o'er the bright waves howled forth the gale, 
Fiercely the lightning flashed en our sail ; 
Vet while our frail bark drove o'er the sea, 
Thine eves:, like load-stars, beamed, love, on me

Thou art forsaken ! dream leant no more I

JESSIE, 
THE BELLE AT THE BAR. 
'Twits at a 
railroad station, in pursuit of my vocation, 
I 
saw a 
tall and handsome girl, who ptood behind the bar. 
1 
heard some one call her JCS 4i 
perhaps, 'twas Mr. Pond, the lessee, 
And her diamond eyes were twinkling, just like the evening star. 
1 
fouud this pretty dame mad° love to all that came, 
In a 
quiet sort of way, with her eyes so tiOn and bright. 
She had love t 
a 
half a 
score, always some one to adore, 
From the first train in the morning, till the last train out at night. 
SeonEN.—Yes, t4er admirers were, 
CLIORCS. 
A tinker mid a 
tailor, and a 
soldier and a 
sailor, 
And a 
swell who usedto talk about his pa and his ma, 
A butcher and a 
baker, and a 
quiet looking quaker, 
All courted pretty Jessie at the rail-road liar. 
Now 
this darling little creature, with a 
smile on every feature, 
Was serving all tie customers with cakes and bitter beer, 
A 
nil this was on a 
Monday; so, I 
asked her it on Sunday 
She would meet too at the Park gate, when she gaVe me such a 
leer, 
And then she said to me, " most happy I 
should be, 
t3ut I'm sorry to inform you that it's not my Sunday out; 
One Sunday out of nine is the only day that's mine ;" 
And then she had to leave me just to serve a 
glass of stout. 
SPOKEN.— Yes, but she never informed me that she had on previous 
Sundays walked out with— 
A tinker, etc. 
Well, better late than never, and I 
thought that I 
was clever, 
To get JePRie dear to meet me, when it was her Suneay out, 
With my hair curled and anointed, at the time and place appointed, 
I 
was there to the minute, and began to look about— 
And when my Jessie came, my heart was in a 
flame, 
When I 
saw her water- fall and her bonnet trimmed so gay. 
She politely took my arm, I 
admired her every charm— 
But judge of my surprise, when I 
heard some urchins say. 
SPOK EN. — I 
say, Pill, if there ain't Jessie, along with another swell! 
why, Pve seen her with— 
A 
tinker, etc. 
Now my confidence was shaken, but I 
thought the boys mietaken, 
And my modesty would not permit to ask if it was true. 
I 
proposed, and she accepted, in a 
manner unaffected, 
And the tears she shed completely hid from me her eyes so blue. 
Then I 
sent her a 
wedding dress, fit for an Empress. 
And saw the porter give it her, while serving at the bar, 
Bat or our weddiniz•day, Miss Jesam ran away 
And a t

The sunlight is beautiful, Mother, 
And sweetly the flo .

Are caroling ever so gay: 
And down by the rock in the meadow, 
The r

And, Mother, I, too, have been singing, 
The merriest all the day long. 
Last night I 
was weeping, dear Mother, 
Last night I was weeping alone 
The world was so dark and so dr, any, 
My heart it grew heavy as stone; 
I 
thought of the lonely and loveless, 
All lonely and loveless was I. 
I scarcely could tell why it was, Mother, 
But, oh! I 
was wishing to die. 
Last night I was weeping, dear Mother, 
But Willie came down by the gate, 
And whispered: Come out in the moonlight; 
I've something to say to you, Kate. 
Oh ! Mother, to him I 
am dear -r 
Than all in the wide world beside; 
He told me so out in the moonlight. 
And called me his darling, his bride. 
So now I

And t,vine in my long braided hair: 
Then Wibie will come in the evening, 
And smile when he sees me so fair— 
And out in the moonlivht we'll wander,

Oh, once I 
was happy and fat, 
But now I 
am wretched and lean; 
The cause of which is a 
nice young girl, 
As pretty as ever was seen; 
She said she loved me true, 
And truly I 
loved her too; 
But, alas! that's past—for I 
found that lass 
Turned out a 
regular do. 
CHORUS. 
She was such a 
nice young girl, 
And just seventeen years old, 
But she's thrown me off for a 
fellow 
With Plenty of California gold. 
She'd had a 
sweet-heart, it was said, 
But lonct• 
she'd thought him dead ; 
Thought I 
to myself, " Oh, won't it be nice 
If she'll take me in his stead." 
So I 
took her to this and to that. 
I 
took her to every show, 
Till the fair feminine said she'd be mine, 
LI

week or two. 
She was such, tittc. 
CALIFORNIA GOLD: 
The time was fast drawing near, 
When a 
strange tale I 
did hear; 
Her first young man had turned up from abroad; 
Oh I 
felt most uncommonly queer 
I 
first felt hot and then cold, 
When the truth to me was told 
That this fellow'd come home in a 
couple of ships 
Full of California gold! 
She was such, tic. 
Yes, in Cali-for-ni-a, 
A 
considerable distance away, 
This party found gold in lumps and clump 
(You've heard of the stuff, I 
dare say) 
It turned out a 
wonderful sort, 
And a 
nice little fortune it brought ; 
So my love deserted me for this fellow, 
And thus of my heart made sport. 
She was euch, 
I 
wish he'd been ate by a 
shark, 
I 
wish he'd been chawed by a 
pyke 
For taking my love away from me 
Without asking me whether I'd like.. 
I 
find I'm considerably sold 
By this damsel so fickle and bold, 
So I'll end my pain at the end of a 
chain; 
Made of Cclifornia gold.

" 
sit at the window," said Granny, 
And watch the garden gate, 
For I 
fancy that idle lad. sailor Dick, 
Will write to my bonnie Kate ; 
For she's imped and sighed all day, 
Since the ships were sent away, 
And early or late, she looks at the gate, 
FO 
r the Post. I'll be humid to say, 
For the Post, I'll be bound to say." 
Ent the twittering swallows under the cave 
Looked I 
auighi mug fr on 
their nest ; 
For the birds and bees, and sighing trees, 
Soon whispered Granny to rest. 
And when bv the rosemary bed, 
Kate heard the Postman's tread, 
Past Granny's closed eyes, she seized her prize 
And back to her spinning she sped, 
And back to her spinning she sped.

Tap, tap, tapping at the garden gate

Why do you blush and falter so ? 
What are you looking fur under the chair I 
The tap. tap, tapping comes not from there. 
Every ni ,dit about half- past eight,

Every night about half-past eight, 
There's tap, tap, tapping at the garden gato-
Oh ! you sly little " fox" you know, 7 
Fidgeting aoout until you go : 
Dropp'd the sugar-spoon I 
why, there it lies, 
Bless the girl, where are your eyes ? 
Were I 
able to leave my chair. 
Soon would T 
find out who is there. 
Don't tell me yon think it's the cat ; 
Cats don't tap. tap, tap like that! 
Cats don't know when it's half-past eight, 
And come tap, tapping at the garden gate.
