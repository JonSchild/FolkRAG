"Dear Mr. President", Tucson, Arizona, January or February 1942
AFS 6447B
Cut B1
Enos Francisco: My name is Enos Francisco. I am a member of the Papago tribe. I work in agriculture
chemistry now. What I think of the war is what all the other Papagos think and what other good
Americans think about cooperating and winning the war. I was very much surprised to go out to the
reservation the other day to find out that the Papagos heard about the Pearl Harbor being attacked.
They were very angry about it. They say that Pearl Harbor was really attacked and one of the cruelest
things that they ever heard. We always want to save our freedom in the olden days too, and now
that we've been attacked we feel the same way again, to fight for our freedom. [Harry(?)] [said to
interviewer].
Cut B2
Enos Francisco: I am a Papago Indian. My name is Enos Francisco and I work in the agriculture
building. What I think about the war is what any other American thinks and what all the Papagos
think. It was surprising to listen to some of â€” when I went up to the reservation the other day to find
that they were mad about Pearl Harbor being attacked. Well it is in same way as in the olden days
when we were attacked by the Apaches. Now the Apaches afraid might take our freedom and some
are [disc skips] away. Now the Germans are threatening to our liberties. It made us mad, especially
when we heard about the Pearl Harbor. Our members are buying defense stamps and are enlisting
and two of our boys have been casualties already, but that doesn't make us change our minds. We
want to do more. We want to do everything we can in working together with our new chief which we
used to do in the olden days, to do just what our chief want us to do. We like to work in any way and
do our best to do and win the war.
