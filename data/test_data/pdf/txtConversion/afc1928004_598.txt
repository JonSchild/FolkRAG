GEM OF THE EMERALD ISLE. 
Words and Music by PAT FEENEY, and dedicated and sung by 
Joux 1VALsu, the Great 1...sh Vocalist, at Harry Miner's 
Theatre, N. Y. 
I'll sing now in praise of the gem of old Ireland, 
Whose names are respected by friend and by foe; 
Of the men who proud to acknowledge their sireland, 
Of men who gained fame by words and by blow; 
Their hearts brave and true, never knew any danger, 
As cheerfully they for their country did toil; 
It must be acknowledged by friend and by stranger, 
That they were bright gems from the Emeral Isle. 
First is Brian Borne, the great King whose example 
If followed by Monarchs of this present day; 
A 
blessing would prove, for his wisdom was ample, 
He knew how to rule in a 
true Kingly way; 
Brave Patrick Sarsfield, exiled from his sireland, 
Exclaimed as he died on a 
foreigner's soil; 
Oh, may heaven grant freedom for old Ireland, 
Then died a 
bright gem of the Emerald Isle. 
If we boast of our gems, surely no one can blame us, 
When we've produced men like those I 
will name; 
Balfe Wallace and Tom Moore who made themselves 
famous, 
• 
With music and poetry they gained their fame; 
There's Sherridan, Goldsmith and Swift, three more 
great men, 
What nation on earth ever equaled their style; 
There's Davitt, Daily and Killen, three more great 
Statesmen, 
All these are bright gems of the Emerald Isle.

GEM OF THE SEA. 
Written by Scorr SANDILAND. Music by JOHN W ALSH, and sung by 
Ma. W ALSH with great success at Tony Pastor's Theatre, and

Greeks and Romans may boast of their ancient heroes, 
Philosophers, poets and orators, too; 
But although we have never had Homers or Nero's, 
Had they ever a 
prince like brave Brian Borne? 
A 
chieftain he was who made all the world fear us, 
In peace or in war he was dauntless and free; 
His shlagaun in battle oft-times did cheer us, 
He died for his country the Gem of the Sea. 
CHORIIs: 
Then hurrah for old Erin, the birthplace of beauty, 
Hurrah for her daughters so fair to be seen; 
hurrah for her sons who in war do their duty, 
Hurrah for the shamrock, that plant ever green. 
And has for the poet on history's pages, 
One name, 'tis deeply engraved I 
am sure; 
His equal they never had in their dark ages, 
Long life to his memory, the gifted Torn Moore; 
Statesmen and patriots we've had in numbers, 
The brave Dan O'Connell remembered will be; 
And also poor Emmet, who in his grave slumbers, 
He died for his country, the Gem of the Sea. 
Let them talk of philosophers, old Thiojaneurs, 
That some people said lived inside a 
tub; 
Compared to poor Paddy, we're certain quite green is, 
A 
smile, faith Pat has for the world's hardest rub; 
With his pipe and his glassful of smoking potheen. 
Sure no king on his throne is as happy as he; 
He's true to his friends and his darling colleen, 
Sure he'd die for his country, the Gem of the Sea,

BRIGHT LITTLE SPOT. 
Words and Music by JOHN W ALSH. The greatest Irish patriotic 
singer in America. 
—: 
0:— 
We're stout-hearted boys from the green shores of Erin, 
That Emerald set in the sea; 
Where bounteous nature her best doth appear in, 
And choicest gifts scattered free; 
Her mountains and valleys with produce abounding, 
Her rivers and lakes filled with life in galore; 
Loveliest scenes on all sides are surrounding, 
The home of the shamrock, old Ireland, asthore. 
CHORUS: 
Hurrah for that bright, little spot on the ocean, 
Harmless around it the rude billows roar; 
True Irish hearts love with fondest devotion, 
The home of the shamrock, old Ireland, asthore. 
Dear granuail, her daughters are peerless, 
Fair and as fresh as the morn; 
Ever in battle her sons they are fearless, 
Death do I 
hold but in scorn; 
Our hearts ever warm to welcome a 
stranger, 
Those in distress never turn from your door; 
And for our country we'll brave every danger, 
The home of the shamrock, old Ireland, asthore. 
I 
love the bright green, and I'm proud, boys, to wear it, 
To it I 
will ever prove true; 
All loyal Irishmen that feeling share it, 
Deeply, indeed, as I 
do; 
Distance or climate that bond cannot sever, 
True in our hearts all this wide world o'er; 
The land of St. Patrick, forget it, no, never! 
The home of the shamrock, old Ireland, asthore.

AS I 
STOOD BY THE DOOR. 
Words by SCOTT SANDILAND. 
Music by Anis W ALSH, and sung by 
MIL W ALSH with great success at all the principal 
Theatres in America. 
A 
short time ago when in Erin's green isle, 
Where freedom for ages has not dared to smile; 
I 
journeyed o'er mountains, through valley and plain 
And what I 
beheld, may I 
nc'er see again. 
A cabin I 
saw, but deserted it seemed, 
The Wintry sun on its roof cheerlessly gleamed; 
No smoke from the chimney curled up to the sky, 
Nor was there a 
trace of life as I 
drew nigh. 
The deadly wolf want, though, in that cot did reign, 
The struggle to keep him out had been in vain; 
Appalled, there I 
stood, touched to the heart's core, 
Now, I'll tell you my thoughts, as I 
stood by the door 
A 
child's voice I 
heard, it was puny and weak, 
In faltering tones the poor creature did speak; 
It begged very hard for a 
small piece of bread, 
Its mother through hunger, lay silent and dead. 
The father looked on, ah! but helpless was he, 
The sight, I 
am sure, it was dreadful to see; 
All in the place had been seized on for rent, 
The landlords with nothing else would be content. 
Assistance I 
gave, but, alas! ' twas too late, 
Child followed mother, a 
terrible fate; 
May I 
never again have such scenes to deplore, 
These were my thoughts, as I 
stood by the door. 
Words and Music by JOHN W ALSH, and sung by him only as a 
topical 
song, with immense success every place he appeared. 
The year of 1880 has gone now to decay, 
Another year from our lives has quickly passed away; 
But during its career many changes we have seen, 
And to many a 
poor man how eventful it has been; 
The truth of what I 
state, will appear now in my rhymes, 
For in them I 
mean to introduce some topics of the times; 
Plain talk alone I 
now will use, so listen to each line, 
And I'll name some things you all would like, ' tis the heart-
felt wish of mine. 
I 
really hope that it will never be my lot again, 
While strolling by the North River to see so many men 
With their faces pinched with hunger and shivering in the 
• cold, 
Such a 
piteous sight has to me quite a 
tale of misery told; 
The long- shore-men attend the stands, yes, morning, noon 
and night, 
In hopes for wives and families that they might earn a 
bite; 
But luck seems all against them, for bread their children 
pine, 
trust they_may see better days, 'tis the heart-felt wish of 
mine. 
A 
glorious brightness has across the Emerald Isle been cast 
Fortune long in coming, seems to smile on her at last; 
English persecution now, I 
think is nearly done. 
Their long, long race of tyranny I 
think is nearly run; 
Too lonc- has Erin slumbered 'neath Saxon's cruel spell, 
Thank God, she's now awakened at the call of brave Parnell 
use, rise, ye true born Irishmen, with a 
firm and resolute 
mind, 
To have our brethren set free, 'tis the heart-felt wish of mine 
Written by JOHN WALsn, and sung with great success 
all over the world. 
Many a, man grows tired and weary, 
As he toils life's road along; 
Everything looks dark and dreary, 
All he does seems to go wrong; 
Yet, I 
say, never be despairing, 
Fortune yet may smile some day; 
And her gifts with yon be sharing, 
So remember what I 
say. 
CHORUS: 
Never, boys, give way to sorrow, 
Sighing only is in vain; 
For the sun will shine to-morrow, 
And the grass will grow again. 
Though false friends should all forsake you, 
Laugh their dirty trick to scorn; 
Luck some day may overtake you, 
When you look the most forlorn; 
Troubles in this world are plenty, 
Few from them are always free; 
Though your pockets should be empty, 
Still take this advice from me. (Chorus). 
ORANGE NELL.. 
Written and sung by JOHN WALsst with great success. 
I'm a 
Nobleman's daughter, och, faith, what's the matter, 
Ye needn't be laughing, 'tis truth that I 
tell; 
I 
was born in Galway, I 
trade in a 
small way, 
The finest of oranges I 
have to sell; 
Don't think that I'm joking, or fun at you poking, 
'Tis truth, every word, och, bad scran to the lie; 
Ye may well believe me, I 
wouldn't deceive ye, 
Although I 
sell oranges, arrah, who'll buy? 
CHORUS: 
They're cheap at the money, sweet, too, as honey, 
As moist as the maiden, and thin-skinned as well; 
For fever and ague, or if thirst should plague you, 
The cure's in the basket of old Orange Nell. 
My dad's name was Ryan, my mother's O'Brien, 
Their relations were Kings at the time of the Flood 
If you look in my face, here, you plainly can trace here, 
The remnants of real, royal, red Irish blood; 
None could be purer, although I 
am poorer, 
Than they used to be, still my pride it is high; 
For the toss of my head, sure, will show I'm well bred, sure 
Although I 
sell oranges, arrah, who'll buy? 
Though I'm proud as Old Harry, I'm wanting to marry, 
Is there ever a 
boy here of high pedigre? 
With a 
pretty long stocking, be dad, I'm not mocking, 
If there is, here's my hand and my heart is quite free; 
lie must be an O'Grady, Mulroony or Brady, 
Six feet without brogues on, and not at all shy; 
Well fit for his duty, or I'll spoil his beauty, 
And make him cry oranges, arrah, who'll buy?

THE TWO MALONE 
S. 
Words and music by J. L. 
BARRETT. 
Dedicated to JOHN WALSH. Sung by FERGUSON and MACK, 
at Tony Pastor's Theatre. 
0:-
On the 15th of September, 
We dressed up neat and gay; 
For to join a 
grand procession, 
We at once set on our way; 
There were tinkers, tailors, scavengers 
And ladies short and tall; 
All went to see the opening 
Of our lovely City Hall. 
There was Mr. Michael Murphy, 
With a 
bran new suit of clothes; 
That was made by Johnny Doherty, 
Whom everybody know; 
Muldoon, the solid man, was there, 
As dacent as could be; 
But there wasn't one in all the lot, 
Could equal him or me. 
()onus: 
Did you see the two M'alones, 
With their shining, bran new hats? 
Did you see them marching off 
Like two young aristocrats? 
There were flags and banners waving high, 
And dress in style was shown; 
But the greatest swells in all the lot, 
Was Pat. and Tim Malone. 
11 
THE TWO MALONES—CoNnbarEn. 
The Mayor, upon the City Han steps, 
Quite stately took his stand; 
lie noticed none till we came by, 
And then he waved his hand; 
He saw at once the style was there, 
For he stared with both his eyes; 
As if he thought we were some lords 
Or dukes dressed in disguise. 
We marched all through the city, 
Till I 
thought we'd never stop; 
So I 
fell out, and then fell into 
Magee's to take a 
drop; 
The people there were talking of 
The sights they saw that day; 
We felt a 
little flattered 
When we heard the women say— (Chorus). 
We received an invitation 
To attend a 
fancy ball; 
Without our evening dress suits, 
We couldn't go at all; 
Mr. Doherty, the tailor, 
Our measure couldn't take; 
Because, for Owney Geoghegan, sure, 
He had a 
suit to make. 
So we both went down to Baxter Street, 
Bought new suits, second hand; 
With a 
piece of shamrock in our hats, 
We looked a 
trifle grand; 
We danced about till midnight, 
And when home in the dark, 
You could scarcely walk a 
foot, 
When you'd hear some one remark—(Cho.)

THE JOLLY OLD SAILOR. 
Written by JOHN W ALSH, and dedicated to and sung by NED BARRY, 
at the Theatre, Comique, N. Y. 
What curious people we meet 
As through this world we go; 
Some are full of deceit, 
While others honesty show; 
Some on mischief are bent, 
If you far from it will roam; 
And others like to interfere, 
With business that's not their own. 
Some will swear that white is black, 
And green is no color at all; 
And others seem to take delight 
In watching another man fall; 
But when inquisitive people 
Wish to know anything from me; 
I 
tell them to, 
ask the sailor, 
For the sailor has been to sea. 
CHORUS: 
For the jolly, old sailor, has been to sea. 
Where the stormy winds do blow; 
And as the sailor has been to sea, 
He's the man that ought to know. 
Old Brigham Young he is dead, 
In picture shape they show 
A 
comical sketch of his bed, 
And his forty wives also; 
• 
13 
THE JOLLY OLD SAILOR—CONTINUED. 
With sixty babes in the front, 
His breeches you'll see hanging there; 
Now there's a 
chance for young girls, 
Who would like the breeches to wear. 
Just fancy having forty wives, 
To please and ,amuse every one; 
They tell me Brigham did it, 
But it's wonderful how it was done; 
For I 
have one, and upon my word, 
She's more than enough for me; 
And one's a 
dose, I've heard it said, 
By the sailor that's been to sea. ( Chorus). 
There's Smikes just over the way, 
He gets so awfully wild; 
And grumbles all the clay, 
Because he's not blessed with a 
child; 
Whilst Smith can boast twenty-four, 
And looks with a 
doleful phiz; 
And says that Smikes should be compelled, 
To keep a 
few of his kids. 
Now when they meet, it's quite a 
treat, 
It causes a 
deal of fun; 
For the one that's got no children, 
Asks the other one how it is done; 
One says this, and the other says that, 
But when they refer-to me, 
I 
tell them to ask the sailor, 
For the sailor has been to sea. (Chorus).

I'm the father of a 
family, 
Six girls and one big boy, 
With the neighbors they are friendly 
They are their mother's joy; 
It's every summer evening, 
When the heat would make you droop; 
Friends there meet from every street 
To gossip on our front stoop. 
Thero's dainty Misses Grogan, 
Alexander McAfee, 
The undertaker Hogan,. 
The pride of Calvary. 
Such splendid vocalization, 
'Twould burst an opera troupe; 
The Sweet By and By would make a 
mat, cus, 
As sung on our front stoop. 
They talk about the kurphys, 
And say they put on style, 
And how their daughter Mary 
Wont down to Coney Isle 
With a

Who filled her with clam soup, 
Then they say, don't give it away,

You'd have to run the gauntlet, 
If ye were walking by, 
They'd have your family history 
In the twinkling of an eye. 
They'd turn you gently over, 
While they 
it there in a 
group, 
They'd give to you sweet Ballyhoo, 
While passing our front stoop. 
They send Kate with a 
pitcher, 
For Cincinnati beer; 
Then their conversation 
For a 
mile or two you'll hear, 
They talk about the babies, 
The whooping coughs mid croup, 
When the moon's out in sight, they say good night, 
And go home from our front stoop.

Private Affair of my Own. 
Written by BEN COLLENS, and respectfully dedicated to AL. W . 
FILSON, 
and sung by him with unbounded success. 
0 
I'm the prince of gay young fellows, 
Who possesses enormous wealth, 
And for those who do not know me 
I 
will introduce myself. 
I'm the favorite of the ladies, 
Refined and quite high-toned, 
My name I 
hope you will excuse 
For reasons of my own. 
SPOKEN—Yes, ladies, and gentlemen, I 
would like to tell 
you my name, but you see it might cause a 
slight misunder-
standing between several lady friends of mine. 
Oh, nothing 
wrong, I 
can assure you, I 
would tell you my name this even-
ing, but you see I 
couldn't, because it's— 
CHORUS. 
A 
private affair of my own, 
It's a 
private affair of my own, 
And it would not be right to tell you to-night, 
For it's a 
private affair of my own. 
Last evening at a 
party 
In the surburbs of this town, 
My heart was really smitten 
By a 
pair of eyes so brown; 
PRIVATE AFFAIR OF MY OWN. 
Continued. 
Her voice it quite bewitched me, 
When I 
heard her play and sing, 
Then a 
handkerchief flirtation, and— 
Oh well, all that sort of thing. 
SPORSN—Yes, I 
met the dear creature at the party, was 
introduved to her, &c., &c., and we became busily engaged in 
an earnest conversation. 
I 
made the proposal, she accepted 
—poor thing. 
I 
then called for some ice cream, soda water, 
and one thing and another. 
She then proposed a 
ride; it was 
agreeable, so I 
called a 
carriage. 
We got in, and we were 
driven to—well I 
would like to tell you where the carriage 
did take us, but I 
couldn't because— 
It's a 
private affair, &c. 
Well, we reached our destination, 
And we hastened to alight, 
Fur the ice cream and the soda 
Had affected my eye-sight. 
We called for more beer and oysters, 
Oh, you have all been there before, 
If not you can easily find the place 
By the number above the door. 
SPOKEN—Yes, we had just got comfortably seated when, 
on looking up, I 
beheld my astonished ,wife standing before 
me, whom I 
had left home three hours before. 
She uttered a 
piercing shriek, and throwing her arms aloft she exclaimed, 
"Sir, what does this mean, that beer, those oysters, that 
woman; explain yourself, sir, explain !" 
I 
arose with rather 
an unruffled expression upon my countenance and another 
upon my shirt-collar, and I 
said, " My dear, (
hit) can't you 
(hit) see, it's nothing WO 
but— 
A 
private affair, &c. 
True To The Core, 
As sung by BILLY RAY. 
MANKIND drifts along thro' this broad sea of care, 
With some 'tis foul weather, while with others ' tis Cal) 
Some help one another to reach the bright shore, 
While others sit silent, despairing the more; 
I've a 
few words to say if you'll list to my song, 
Your attention I 
claim, I 
will not keep you long, 
My subject you'll own t 
s 
a 
new one, I'm sure, 
For I'll sing about men that are true to the core. 
I'll sing first of one whom all Irishmen love, 
Who gave up his life his devotion to prove; 
He died for his country, he cared not for fame, 
And each true son of Erin reveres his dear name; 
I 
mean not brave Richard O'Connor o 
f 
old, 
I 
mean not staunch Daniel O'Connell the bold, 
Nor Ireland's sweet poet, the warm-hearted Moore, 
But brave Robert Emmett was true to the core. 
And now let me speak of America's friend, 
Who pledged his young life for Liberty's end, 
Hand in hand with our Washington, noble and true, 
Who fought 'neath our banner, the red, white and blue; 
Prom his own sunny Prance, from his kindred and home, 
Across the broad ocean he feared not to roam, 
Let the battle echoes of old days of yore, 
Tell if dear Lafayette was not true to the core. 
Another name dear to us all here to-night, 
He loved his own comrades who sought to do right, 
When the tierce storm of war overwhelming our land, 
To his country he offered his heart and his hand, 
Tho' some misconstrued him, the' others may blame, 
They never can tarnish his honor and fame, 
Let the red battle fields on Virginia's shore, 
Echo that brave little Mac was true to the core. 
I 
will sing now of one whom the whole world adores, 
Whose name is revered on all foreign shores, 
America's hero, Columbia's star, 
A 
statesman in peace, and a 
lion in war; 
trrom the bloody- stained battle-ground of Lundy Lane, 
From Princetown and Germantown rises again, 
The echo of voices, bring evermore, 
That Washington ever was true to the core.

The Widow in the Cottage by the Sea. 
Just one year ago to-day, lore, 
I 
became your happy bride, 
Changed a 
mansion for a 
cottage, 
To dwell by the river sides 
You told me I'd be happy, 
But no happiness I 
see, 
For to-night I 
am a 
widow, 
In the cottage by the sea. 
CHORUS.—( May be sung or omitted.) 
Alone, all alone by the sea-side he left me, 
And no other's bride I'll be; 
For in bridal flow'rs he deek'd me, 
In the cottage by the sea. 
From my cottage by the sea side. 
I 
can see my mansion home, 
I 
can see those hills and valleys, 
Where with pleasure I 
have roamed; 
The last time that I 
met him, 
Oh, how happy then were we, 
But to-night I 
am a 
widow, 
In the Cottage by the sea. 
Oh I 
my poor and aged father, 
How in sorrow he would wail, 
And my poor and aged mother, 
How in tears her eyes would swell. 
And my poor and only brother, 
Oh, how he would weep for me, 
If he only knew his sister, 
Was a 
widow by the sea. 
THE WILD IRISH BOY. 
1.s sung by M ILES M ORRIS, at Fox's American Theatre, Philad'a, Pa. 
FAREWELL to the dear land I 
have left far behind, 
Farewell to my father, although he was blind, 
Shall I 
ever forget him while my heart beats with joy, 
For he called me his own son, the wild Irish boy, 
Yes, he called me his own son, the wild Irish boy. 
When I 
came to this country I 
had brogans on my feet, 
And corduroy breeches, although they were neat, 
Sure the boys all laughed at me, but it gave me great joy, 
For they called me their hero, the wild Irish boy, 
Yes, they called me their hero, the wild Irish boy. 
I 
will send for my parents, and they will come here, 
To a 
land Elled with plenty and a 
land I 
love dear, 
I 
know they will bless me and it will give me great joy, 
For they will call me their darling, their wild Irish boy. 
Yes, they will call me their darling, their wild Irish boy, 
There's the land of my kindred, I 
ne'er can forget, 
They may hen time coming when it may be happy yet, 
I 
wish to God it were now, for ' twould give me great joy, 
For to gaze once more on it, though a 
wild Irish boy. 
Yes, to gaze once more on it, though a 
wild Irish boy. 
He'd a 
weed on his hat, this sad stranger, 
His clothing, tho' shabby, was black; 
His countenance seemed to grow paler, 
As he walked with his hands at his back. 
I 
wondered if he was reflecting 
On bitter, sad things past and dead; 
His mind, seemed to me, as rejecting 
Those things, for he oft shook his head! 
But plainer than words did the hat with the weiot, 
Tell a 
story of mourning and sorrow, indeed. 
He sat in a 
chair at the table, 
His eyes fixed steadfast on the floor; 
I 
sympathized, but was scarce able 
To tell him I 
pitied him sore; 
My glance caught his eyes as he raised them, 
My pity he seemed to detect; 
" 
This world's a 
sad dream," he exclaimed, then, 
I 
listened with silent respect— 
For I 
felt that a 
sorrowing soul was in need 
Of a 
friend that could feel, as I 
looked at the weed. 
He gazed on the floor for a 
minute, 
Then mournfully sighing, he said, 
" 
Ah, yes; a 
sad dream; nothing in it;" 
Then I 
asked, " if his mother was dead?" 
"No?" " Perhaps some dear sister or brother?" 
He answered, " I 
never had one;" 
" 
Some near, dear relation or other?" 
He replied, " There are none of them gone." 
Yet no common sorrow could make a 
heart bleed, 
Lit.,Q the heart of the man with the hat with a 
weed. 
• 
His mood changed. " Why question?" he thunderd, 
As he suddenly sprang to his feet; 
" 
Dost consider me prey to be plundered, 
By confidence man, and dead beat? 
Or art thou an Epitaph maker? 
As your questions would seem to imply? 
Or Tomb- stone man? Leech? Undertaker? 
Which, or either? Come answer, thou spy!" 
Then I 
stammered and stuttered, embarrassed, indeed 
Not a 
word could I 
utter, but point to the weed. 
The fierce light left his eye; " oh!" he muttered, 
" 
My violence pardon, he's dead;" 
Then his thanks for my pity he uttered, 
" 
His memory I 
revere," he said; 
" 
This weed on my hat's a 
memento, 
Of a 
father beloved, but now gone;" 
" 
Your Father? I 
asked;" No, his Country's, 
I 
mourn for dear George Washington; 
Then I 
borrowed a 
gun to accomplish a 
deed, 
Twas to shoot—not the man—but the hat with the 
weed.

THE WEARING OF THE GREEN. 
As sung by ALICE BEYNErr. 
Oh! Paddy, dear, and did you hear the news that's goin' 
round, 
The shamrock is forbid by law to grow on Irish ground; 
Saint Patrick's day no more we'll keep, his color can't be 
seen, 
for there's a 
bloody law agin., the wearin' o' the green ? 
I 
met with Napper Tandy and he tuk me by the hand, 
And he said " how's poor ould Ireland, and how does she 
stand ?" 
She's the most distressful country that ever you have seen; 
They're hanging men and women there for " Wearin' 
the Green !" 
[Repeat as Chorus.] 
Then since the color we must wear. is England's cruel red, 
Sure Ireland's sons will ne'er forget the blood that they 
have shed; 
You may take the Shamrock from your.hut, and cast it on 
the sod, 
But 'twill take root and flourish still, tho' under foot 'tis trod 
When the law can stop the blades of grass from growing 
as they grow, 
And when the leaves in summer time their verdure dare 
not show; 
Then I 
will change the color I 
wear in my corbeen; 
But 'till that day, please God, I'll stick to " Wearin' o' the 
Green." 
[Repeat as Chorus.] 
But if at last our color should be torn from Ireland's heart, 
Her sons with shame and sorrow from the dear old soil will 
part; 
I've heard whisper of a 
country that lies far beyant the say, 
Where rich and poor stand equal in the light of freedom's 
day; 
Oh, Erin must we lave you, driven by the tyrant's hand, 
lust we ask a 
mother's welcome from a 
strange but hap-
pier land ? 
Where the cruel cross of England's thraldom never shall 
be seen, 
And where, thank God, we'll live and die, still • Wearin' 
o' the Green." 
[Repeat as Chorus.]

The Wedding Day. 
IRISH COMIC SONG.

MACK. 
Published and copyrighted 1879, by E. H. Harding, 229 Bowery, and sent 
to any address, post-paid, on receipt of 35 cents. 
When I 
landed at Castle Garden, 
About ten years ago, 
I 
made my home in a 
tenement house, 
In Cherry street below, 
'Twas there I 
got acquainted 
Wid a 
German girl so gay, 
It was only six months after, 
She named my wedding day. 
CHORUS. 
Ring a 
wreath of roses, 
We'll ring a 
wreath for thee, 
All the little children, 
Sang so sweet to me; 
Ladies came in carriages, 
With presents and boquets, 
To little Michael Callihan, 
Upon his wedding day. 
It was on a 
Saturday evening, 
With laugh and merry shout, 
The boys and girls in the neighborhood, 
So gaily did turn out ; 
The old folks dressed their very best, 
And had funny things to say 
To Mike and Lena Callihan, 
Upon their wedding day. 
(Chorus.) 
There was August Schmitt and Kunkle, 
And Henry Ciselmyer, 
With all my wife's relations, 
And Cohn the old clothes buyer. 
My brothers Pat and Danny, 
Wid the ladies danced the glide, 
Bt the Germans tried to kill them when 
They tried to kiss the bride. 
(Chorus.)

_KISS, AND FORGET, LOVE, 
Words by ARTHUR W . 
FRENCH Music by CHAS. D. 
M AIM. 
As sung by JENNIE MORGAN. 
Music to be had of Wm. A. 
POND & Co., 547 Broadway. Price 30ets. 
Here by thy side, love, sadly I 
stand, 
Eager to feel the soft touch of your hand, 
Waiting to hear again thy sweet voice; 
Tender words breathing to make me rejoice; 
How have I 
suffered and wished I 
were dead, 
For those sad words that in anger I 
said ; 
Oh, whisper you cherish for all, no regret, 
Say you forgive me, then kiss and forget, 
CHOLUS. 
Kiss and forget, love, each angry word; 
Speak but to tell me my pleading is heard; 
Kiss and forget love, each angry word ; 
Speak but to tell me my pleading is heard: 
Why should your heart be repining yet? 
Say you forgive me, then kiss and forget. 
Why should your heart be repining yet? 
Say you forgive me, then kiss and forget. 
Smile on me, dearest, same as of old, 
Rest on my bosom thy tresses of gold; 
Tell me in accents tender and true, 
All that my loving lips once did repeat. 
I 
have been wayward and unkind to you, 
Yet in my heart I 
have ever been true, 
Think of the past with no mournful regret, 
Say you forgive me, then kiss and forget. 
Kiss and forget, &c. 
Why did we ever wander apart, 
Filling with sorrow each happy young heart, 
Love's rosy pathway should know of no teats, 
Never a 
shadow of sorrowful fears. 
Life should be joyous to you and to me, 
Fair as the sunlight that kisses the sea. 
Let us go back to the day that we met, 
Banishing all as we kiss and forget. 
Kiss and forget, &e,

Der mule shtood on der steamboad deck, 
For der land he wouldn't dread,

Und vacked him over der headt. 
But obstinate and braced he shtood,

Und dough dhey dundered blow on blow, 
He aldered nod his mind.

The Theatres, now, are voted slow, 
A 
Music Hall's the thing. 
We Hansom off to the joliest, 
To hear the Comique's sing; 
We go in for no end of charm, 
No end of bright Moselle; 
But when the ballad is over boys, 
We sally out pell-mell. 
Originally sung by MISS ELLA W ESNER, at the Eagle 
Theatre, with great success. 
Oh! " tou-jour gais," my motto, boys- — 
Confound your doleful dumps— 
I'm known upon the town, boys, 
As the jovial King of Trumps. 
I'm the favorite of all jolly dogs, 
They drag me out at night; 
For when they have got me with them 
Of course they know they're right. 
Trumps, trumps, trumps— 
Whenever you're down in the dumps, 
Come, come with me for a 
jolly spree, 
For I 
am King of Trumps. 
I've coffee and seltzer water boys, 
And look in at the Club; 
Shy in for chicken hazzard, boys, 
Or cut in for a 
rub; 
But when Big Ben strikes ten, 
We pitch pasteboard and bones away, 
For ten o'clock at night, boys, 
Is our favorite time of day. 
Trumps, trumps, tte, 
Trumps, trumps, Ice. 
VVe stand up, next, perhaps to dance, 
Or stand up in a 
row; 
But its all the same to us, you know, 
And we come out right somehow; 
I've visions next of Hay Markets— 
I 
hope its but a 
dream— 
But we mingle with society 
That's not the cream of cream. 
Trumps, trumps, Ize. 
Where next we go, I 
never know— 
It may be, perhaps. pell-mell; 
Or, perhaps it is Saint Giles ; 
But the wine begins to tell; 
We see a 
double everything 
In every street we roam; 
And so at last we call a 
cab, 
And double back to home. 
Trumps, trumps, &c.

Kicking Mule. 
Copyrighted, 1879, by A. J. FlanEn, 24 Vesey St., N.Y, 
Originally sung by BILLY CARTED,. 
There was a 
little kicking man, 
His name was Simon Slick, 
He owned a 
mule with dreamy eyes, 
And how that mule could kick. 
He'd shut one eye and shake his tail, 
And greet you with a 
smile, 
Then gently telegraph his leg, 
And raise you half a 
mile. 
CHORUS. 
This mule was a 
kicker, 
He'd raise you up slicker, 
And knock you down quicker 
Than Baxter street liquor, 
He eat like a 
micker, 
A 
hungry bill sticker, 
As a 
kicker, no quicker 
Could ever be found. 
His skin was gutta percha, 
And his hoof was hard as lead, 
He'd lift y( u 
like a 
feather too, 
And star d 
you on your head, 
He'd kick as quick as lightning, 
And he had an iron jaw, 
He was just the thing to have around 
To tame your mother-in-law. 
CHORUS. 
His hoof would amaze ye 
And make you feel hazy, 
How nice he could raise ye 
And knock you clean crazy. 
This mule was a 
daisy, 
Although he was lazy, 
This daisy so lazy 
Could kick like a 
steer.

KICKING MULTI 
(Continued.) 
116 bit a 
Thomas cat in two, 
And pulverized a 
hog, 
lie dissected seven Chinamen, 
And mash'd a 
yaller dog, 
He kicked the stuffing from a 
goose, 
And broke a 
nigger's back, 
And stopped an Erie railway train, 
And kicked it off the track. 
CHORUS. 
His shoes they were rusty, 
His temper was crusty, 
His eyes they were musty, 
His tail it was dusty, 
His shape would disgust ye, 
He'd kick till he'd bust ye„ 
He was musty and dusty, 
And rusty also. 
He'd stop a 
steamboat with his head, 
And kick it out of sight, 
He'd kick a 
boarding house apart 
At twelve o'clock at night. 
The boarders in their short stop clothes (suits), 
They stood and held their breath, 
When he rammed his hind legs down his throat 
And kicked himself to death. 
CHORUS. 
This mule he was spunky, 
He'd climb like a 
monkey 
And bray like a 
donkey, 
You bet he was bunkey, 
Although he was chulakey. 
No fool or no flunkey 
Played him for a 
monkey, 
Or donkey, oh, no.

I 
dream of the now, in thy beauty and pride, 
Sweet home that I 
left long ago! 
And friends of my youth roam again by my side, 
In twilight's enchantment and glow. 
In visions, I 
see lovely faces of old, 
And smiles like the blossoms of May ; 
Oh! blessings forever thy valleys unfold, 
Thou dear little Isle far away ! 
Cnouns 
The sweetest of homes, and the joy of my heart, 
Still fonder to me, day by day; 
Bright mem'ries of thee never more shall depart, 
Thou dear little Isle far away ! 
I 
roam on thy shore, in my childhood again, 
And list to the waves while they sing ; 
Thy visions of old are unclouded by pain, 
And sweetest of pleasures they bring. 
The voices I 
loved wake my heart to delight, 
While back to thy valleys I 
stray; 
And fancy can picture no lovelier sight, 
Than thee, little Isle far away!

Good-Tempered Man. 
Written and sung with tremendous success by the great and onli 
HARRY RICHMOND, the refined comic vocalist. 
What a 
pity to hear some people declare 
That life is a 
burden of sorrow and care; 
I've lived forty years in this valley of tears, 
And of troubles I've had a 
full share, 
And I 
find it is wiser to laugh than to cry, 
And merrily sing if you can; 
Clouds that are dark may clear by-and-by, 
So laugh like a 
good-tempered man, 
Ha! ha! ha! 
I 
was always a 
good-tempered man. 
My courting I 
paid to a 
fair pretty maid, 
When I 
asked her to wed she lovingly said, 
" 
Dear Daniel it's true I'm faithful to you, 
Believe me and don't be afraid." 
But in less than a 
month her promise she broke, 
And off with another she ran; 
I 
laughed and treated it all as a 
joke, 
For I'm such a 
good-tempered man. 
Ha! ha! ha! 
Oh, I'm such a 
good-tempered man. 
A mob in the street I 
happened to meet, 
A 
thief with a 
snatch ran away with my watch, 
My hat with surprise was knock'd over my eyes, 
Crying " Stop thief," the people all ran, 
But I 
never moved an inch from the spot, 
But to laugh and to dance I 
began, 
To think what a 
guy at that moment I 
look'd, 
Oh I'm such a 
good-tempered man. 
Ha! ha! ha! 
Oh! I'm such a 
good-tempered man. 
Then never give way to that demon dismay. 
If to-day you are down and acquaintances. frown 
To-morrow may bring quite a 
different thing, 
And life's but a 
flash in the pan. 
If care, as they tell us, once killed a 
poor cat, 
Though scarcely believe them I 
can, 
Like me you are bound to get jolly and fat, 
If you laugh like a 
good-tempered man, 
Ha! ha! ha!

good-tempered Mall* 
Goose with the Golden Egg. 
Writteh by Bobby Newcomb and sung by Chas. H. Dun • 
can, with the Bergers, season 188o- t. 
When I 
was of age my father he left 
To me quite a 
sung little sum ; 
He said, my dear boy, good sense please employ, 
And remember you've reached twenty-one. 
My friends when they heard of what had occurred, 
How they hastened to borrow or beg; 
For I 
flew a 
high kite, and they said, when in sight— 
He's the goose with the golden egg. 
To my utmost surprise I 
attracted all eyes, 
And persons inquired my name, 
Who a 
few months before had pronounced me a 
bore, 
Of my dress and my features made game, 
But they'd laugh when I'd joke,with me drink,dine or smoke 
To my face they were dumb as a 
keg; 
But when I'd turn my back how the'd laugh and the'd clack 
At the goose with the golden egg. 
Now the girls all so fair, admired my hair, 
It was auburn—before it was red ; 
They spoke of my style, drooped their eyes when I'd smile, 
And mamas marked me fit to be wed. 
Their daughters all sighed, and some their hair dyed, 
I 
was loved by Jane, Martha and Meg; 
My presents they took, and they all tried to hook— 
The poor goose with the golden egg. 
But a 
day came at last, I'd been living too fast, 
Run in debt and my money all flown, 
My friends when I'd call let me wait in the hall, 
And a 
message I'd get " Not at home." 
They giggled and jeered where'er I 
appeared, 
Pass me by with a 
nod or a 
sneer; 
For the goose it was dead, and the egg turned to lead, 
I 
had bought my experience dear. 
This subject of rhyme may just be in time, 
For the world—but I 
don't care a 
peg; 
But what I 
would say—I 
was once in my day, 
A poor goose with a 
golden egg.

FRIENDS THAT STAND BY US. 
Written and Sung, with great BLIOC888, by Wm. COURTRIQUIT. 
NOW, then, subjects for songs nowadays are so scarce, 
And to find one I've looked far and near every tay; 
And the more that I've looked, it seems more like a 
farce, 
For its something like looking fcr needles in hay. 
There's a 
song for the rich, the poor and the sot, and 
The aristocrat's conscience so weak and so dim, 
But now for a 
song of those friends ne'er forgotten, 
The friends that stood by us through thick and through 
thin. 
We'll first take the babe, as its nursed in the cradle, 
As its papa and mamma cries dear little elf, 
And vigorously uses one end of the ladle, 
I've no doubt you all know how the thing works your-
self. 
Now, boys, should a 
father or mother advise you, 
Pray do not get hot-headed and call it a 
whim, 
For right its their wish you can wager to guide you, 
They're the friends to stand by you through thick und 
• 
through tkin.

Our country's made up of all classes, all nations, 
Ev'ry mixture, all colors, all kinds and all creeds; 
Don% ffown oi a 
man in a 
poor humble station, 
But you must judge a 
man by his actions and deeds. 
At times when our old starry flag was in danger, 
Uncle Sam wanted brave hearts his battles to win, 
Our foreign friends, boys, were the first to endanger 
Their lives to stand by us through thick and through 
thin. 
Our great war is over, our bright starry emblem 
O'er thousands of freedmen in triumph now wave. 
God bless our brave soldiers, who that flag protected, 
Who gave up their lives, and now sleep in their grave. 
Our southern friends, boys, were true and brave soldiers, 
They stood their ground manly, and tried hard to win. 
And should they be called to expel some invader, 
I 
know they'd stand by us through thick and through 
thin. 
Written by JAMES RicnmoNn for PAT RooNEY, and sung by him 
with tremendous success. 
I 
am a 
swell, I 
am worth thirteen millions, 
The ladies say I 
am too sweet; 
I 
am as handsome as a 
clothing store dummy, 
I 
can put a 
baby's pair of shoes on my feet; 
They tell me I 
am a 
terrible masher, 
And I 
ought to make plenty of cash; 
When I 
wink at the girls they go crazy, 
To see me trying to raise a 
mustache. 
CHORUS: 
When I 
walk on the street fast for pleasure, 
They look at each other and gape; 
They'll holler out loudly from the windows, 
McCormick I 
am struck on your shape. 
My picture is for sale throughout the country, 
They all think I 
am some Duke or King; 
At a 
Ball or a 
high-toned Reception, 
All the girls ask me to sing; 
I 
am going to marry the Duchess of Chicago, 
And drive a 
great big four-in-hand; 
We'll have all the nobility at our wedding, 
And be serenaded by a 
sheet iron band. 
CHORUS: 
When I 
wink at the girls they go crazy, 
They think I 
am a 
Banker or own some Gold Mine 
They laugh at my collar and mustache, 
I 
am Clarence Wm. Henry O'Brien. 
BIDDY MULDOON. 
Written by Mrs. CHAS. A . 
GARDNER expressly for JAS. KEARNEY, as 
sung by him with CLINTON FALL'S STRATEGISTS. 
Of all of the darlings that ever I've seen, 
There's none in this world like my sweet little colleen; 
Her eyes are as bright as the stars in the sky, 
And my heart it keeps thumping whenever she's nigh. 
If there was an island away out in the sea, 
And only room on it for Biddy and me, 
We'd live there alone from December till .Tune, 
With only meself and sweet Biddy Muldoon. 
CHonus: 
Biddy, Biddy, Biddy Muldoon, 
Open your window and look at the moon; 
I'll knock any man in the middle of June, 
That dares to make love to you, Biddy Muldoon. 
We're soon going back to ould Ireland so green, 
Then she'll be all mine, my own sweet little colleen; 
Iler smile is as sweet as the violets in May, 
And the sunshine is cold when my Biddy's away; 
The daylight has gone and the stars are beyant, 
To stay here much longer I'm sure that I 
can't; 
She said she'd be here, by the light of the moon, 
Mavoureen, acushla, sweet Biddy Muldoon. (Chorus).

A 
man entered a 
well-known restaurant the other da) and 
called for a 
dinner. 
His orders were of the most elaborate 
character, and fairly staggered the resources of even so noted 
a 
restaurant keeper. 
He lingered long at the table, and 
finallytwound •up with a 
bottle of wine. 
Then lighting a 
cigar he ordered, he leisurely sauntered up to the counter, 
and said to the proprietor: 
"Very fine dinner, landlord, 
Just charge it to me. I 
haven't got a 
cent." 
" 
But I 
don't know you," said the proprietor, indignantly. 
" 
Of course you don't. 
If you had, you wouldn't have let 
me had tlre dinner." 
" 
Pay me for the dinner, I 
say." 
"And I 
say I 
can't. 
Haven't got the blunt." 
" 
I'll see about that," said the proprietor, somewhat furiouhr 
at the bill. 
Then he snatched a 
revolver from the drawer 
and leaped over the counter, collared the man, exclaiming, as 
he pointed it at his head: 
" 
Now see if you'll get away with that dinner without pay-
ing for it, you scoundrel." 
"What is that you hold in your hand?' said the getter-
away-with-free- dinners, drawing back. 
" 
That is a 
revolver, sir." 
"Oh, that's a 
revolver, is it. 
I 
don't care a 
pin for a r

thought it was a 
stomach-pump." 
I 
DO not remember to have seen any epitaph in which 
man's virtues are more concisely stated than that upon the 
tate Mr. Cut Mink: 
"

Pretty Little Blue-Eyed Stranger. 
Copyrighted 1877, by F. W . 
H ELMICK, 136 West Fourth street, 
Cincinnati, Ohio. 
Written, composed and sung by BOBBY NEWCOMBE, with great success. 
When the summer breeze was blowing 
O'er the land and far across the sea ; 
I 
met a 
little blue-eyed stranger, 
As pretty as can be, 
Her dress the pink of neatness, 
Her walk the height of grace, 
Her smile the mould of sweetness, 
And such a 
handsome face. 
CHORUS. 
Oh ! when the summer breeze was blowing, 
O'er the land and far across the sea, 
I 
met a 
little blue-eyed stranger, 
As pretty as can be. 
Wavy golden ringlets flowing 
To the breeze so merry, light and free, 
That kissed the little blue-eyed stranger, 
As pretty as can be. 
Towards her I 
walked gaily, 
While waves rolled on the shore, 
I 
tried to speak, but vainly, 
I 
ne'er felt so before. 
Oh! when the summer, & c. 
The sequel to the story knowing, 
The end of course you'd like to hear from me; 
I've wed this little blue-eyed stranger, 
As pretty as can be. 
'We're living in contentment 
just down by the shore, 
And another little stranger 
Now plays around the door. 
Oh ! when the summer, &c. 
The wards of this Song are published annonymously, and from 
eseir extreme martial character many would suppose them to be 
the production of some enthusiastic Highlander ; the absence of 
the writer's name might, at first, be intended to favor that conclu -
sion ; but now it is generally ascribed to the accomplished Author-
ess of the " Lays from Strathern." The music is original and very 
effective. 
There's many a 
man of the Cameron Clan 
That has followed his chief to the field, 
He has sworn to support him or die by his side, 
For a 
Cameron never can yield. 
CHORUS. 
I 
hear the Pibroch sounding, 
Sounding deep o'er the mountains and glens, 
While light springing footsteps are trampling the heath, 
'Tis the march of the Cameron men. 
Oh, proudly they walk, but each Cameron knows, 
He may tread on the heather no more; 
But boldly he follows his Chief to the field, 
'Where his laurels were gather'd before. 
I 
hear, ctc. 
The moon has arisen, it shines on that path, 
Now trod by the gallant and true,

My Old Kentucky Home, Good-sight 
llits%ic, with Piano Forte Accompaniment, published by Messrs. Firth 
Pond & Co., New York. 
THE sun shines bright in the old Kentucky home; 
'Tis summer, the darkies are gay, 
The corn-top's ripe and the meadows in the bloom, 
While the birds make music music all the day. 
The young folks roll on the little cabin floor, 
All merry, all happy and bright; 
By-' n-by hard times comes a-knocking at the do 
Then ray old Kentucky home, far away. 
Cuottus. 
Weep no more, my lady, 
Oh! weep no more to- day; 
We will sing one song for the old Kentucky home, 
For the old Kentucky home, far away. 
They hunt no more for the possum and the coon 
On the meadow, the hill, and the shore: 
They sing no more by the glimmer of the moon, 
On the bench by the old cabin door. 
The day goes by like a 
shadow o'er the heart, 
With sorrow where all was delight, 
The time has come when the darkies have to part, 
Then my old Kentucky home. good-night. 
Weep no more, & c. 
The head must bow and the back will have to bend, 
Wherever the darkey may go; 
A 
few more days and the trouble all will end 
In the field where the sugar canes grow; 
A 
few more days for to tote the weary load— 
No matter, ' twill never be light; 
A few more days till we totter on the road, 
Then my old Kentucky home, good-night I 
Weep no more,

The Greatest Trick Book of the Age. 
HiRPTY D'AVIPTY 
IT PLEASES BOTH OLD AND YOUNG, 
It is a Fac simile of a Trick practiced by all 
the Professors of Magic. 
It is arranged so systematically, and is accom-
panied with directions so plainly written, that, with 
a 
single perusal, any person may become an adept 
in an unfailing source of amusement. 
Read what a leading Journal says of it: 
" 
An ingenious little book of the thaumaturgic ordek 
has been sent us, called LIUMPTY DUMPY!, and bound 
in such a 
way as to give opportunity for a 
decidedly 
puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary appear-
ance of a 
child's picture-book, gayly printed and colored, 
it is so bound that a 
practiced manipulator, taking it 
up, and flirting the leaves rapidly over, can make it ap-
pear to be filled with copies of only one picture, or with 
blank pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of 
figures. 
One minute the pamphlet, quickly thumbed, 
appears to contain nothing but portraits of Harlequin, 
in his tesselated suit; the next, only Columbine; then, 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or Mephisto-
pheles. 
A. little practice, and the directions printed 
with the book will make anybody at _home in the hand-
ling of it."—Phila. Evening Bulletin.
