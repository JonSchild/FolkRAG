Interview 
[00:00:00] 
Sarah Filkins:   This is Sarah Filkins Interviewer, speaking with Lori Brown, AIA on Thursday, 
July 2, 2020. We were originally scheduled to meet on March at Ms. Brown’s office at Syracuse 
University in Syracuse, New York. Due to the covid pandemic we are now recording this 
interview remotely. Today Lori Brown is in her home office in Syracuse, New York and I am in 
my home office in Washington, DC. We thank Lori for agreeing to share her story with us as part 
of the Library of Congress,  American Folklife Center, Occupation Folklife Project funded by an 
Archie Green Fellowship. 
Lori Brown was born in 1969 in Decatur Georgia. 
In addition to her teaching responsibilities as a Professor in the Syracuse University School of 
Architecture since 2001and serving as the Faculty Advisor for Women in Design she is also 
Director of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion at the university. Lori discusses her current 
commitments. 
Lori Brown: I lead ArchiteXX, a women in architecture organization based out of New York 
City that I co-founded in 20—it started in 2012 but it became a nonprofit in 2015. So I teach full-
time both undergraduate and graduate students, I also am an activist with the organization and I 
research and engage different publics around issues of social justice and gender equity within the 
discipline and society at large. 
SF: 
When did you first become aware of architecture or the built environment?  
LB: 
So my grandfather on my Dad’s side was an engineer and had an engineering and 
construction company and my Dad had grown up working with him as well as my uncle growing 
up and then he ended up doing something else but then worked with him a little bit later on. And 
I—so from a very early age, construction and building was something I heard being discussed 
around the house and with relatives and didn’t know what architecture was but I knew that—I 
began to understand more about building and about construction but never was architecture or 
architects discussed within that framework. So it really wasn’t until high school when I really 
loved art and I loved the sciences and for some reason those two equated to architecture. I don’t 
remember exactly the moment that that happened but somehow that—those two things equaled 
architecture and so I decided to study it not really having any idea what that meant.  
SF: 
Did you know any architects or any women architects? 
LB: 
Definitely no women architects. I do remember we went to this Baptist church. I grew up 
in Atlanta, Georgia and the architects of the building that the church was housed in were 
members of the church. I remember the architect being called out and congratulated when they’d 
finished different renovation projects on the—in the complex of the church. So I remember just 
Lori Brown Interview, July 2, 2020
Women Architects, afc2019/031

thinking about the space where we were worshipping and the construction of it—it was a wood 
timber, really tall, multi-story tall sanctuary and I remember being intrigued by that space every 
Sunday. So when my mind would wander off I would just—I would really just look at the ceiling 
all the time. So whether that’s a direct correlation or not, I know it definitely had some impact 
just growing up and thinking and being surrounded by a space that had a certain power to it. 
SF: 
Did your family travel or were your parents—were they aware of women as architects —
of sharing different buildings with you when you travelled or pointing them out? 
LB: 
When we would travel we would go to art museums, but it wasn’t  
[00:05:00] 
that we were seeking out or my parents were seeking out specific buildings. It was really I think 
really about cultural spaces and I grew up in a household where I was incredibly supported to do 
anything I wanted and you know, looking back there still was a lot of gender divisions. I mean 
it’s in the South, it was—Atlanta was slower. That region of the country was slower I think to 
evolve than say the Northeast in some ways. And so, but there was never a question of whether I 
could do it or not just because of my gender. It was, “If that’s what you want to do, absolutely 
you should go do it.” So it was—I think the support of just studying what I was interested in was 
more important than what it actually was. 
SF: 
So when you started looking for a college you were looking specifically for architecture 
programs? 
LB: 
Yes, I was and I desperately wanted to leave the Southeast and my parents at that time 
were going through some financial difficulty and I really to this day can’t get a straight answer 
out of my Dad. My Mom passed away many years ago—about whether they had any idea about 
architecture programs beyond Georgia Tech which is where I went to undergrad. And in the end 
they basically said, “Well, it’s a state school. It’s very close. It’s affordable and that’s where we’ll 
pay for you to go to school. And I so wanted to leave but you know, there are financial 
constraints and it ended up being a very good program—one of the strongest actually in the 
country at the time. But I think it was serendipitous that the program was as good as it was. I 
really don’t think that my parents had any inkling that that was true. 
SF: 
But then you spent a year in Paris, didn’t you, studying your last year? 
LB: 
Yes, yes so the one really attractive element of going to Georgia Tech was they had a 
study abroad program your last year as an undergrad. It was a four year program, a bachelor of 
science, so yes and I was able to go and spend my entire senior year studying in Paris. And that 
was life-transforming. And that alone was worth, in the end, going to Georgia Tech for. 
SF: 
And so you took architecture specific classes and studios in Paris? 
Lori Brown Interview, July 2, 2020
Women Architects, afc2019/031

LB: 
Yes, so the way it was arranged at the time, and I think they’ve actually cancelled the 
program now but at the time there were Georgia Tech professors that would go for each quarter 
and there would also be some Parisian professors that would teach us as well so it was a 
combination of both Georgia Tech professors and the Georgia Tech professors, which the French 
professors were more responsible for walking tours and engaging in local history and culture. 
And then the Georgia Tech professors were our design studios and some of the more research 
oriented seminars that we would take. So in the end, it was a really great combination because 
you in some ways got the best of both worlds because the faculty at Georgia Tech were 
incredibly strong and maybe one criticism was that they didn’t act as if we were abroad. Like we 
didn’t get any—relief of expectations from our studios or other courses. There was the same 
amount of intensity and expectation whether we were in Atlanta or in Paris.  
SF: 
What aspects of architecture, as you were completing your undergraduate and then 
looking at graduate schools. What aspect of architecture was it that really intrigued you or 
interested you? Was it as a potential designer, construction or specifications or technology?Or 
opening your own practice? 
LB: 
Well, I loved design and at that point in time I—that was the kind of passion that drove 
me primarily. But then I also really liked the history courses that I took in urban form and some 
of the more visual representation courses but it was primarily design that really—a passion was 
ignited. And you know, I thought, one: I was there—what I imagined was that I was—have a 
small practice eventually and teach cuz I loved being  
[00:10:00] 
in school and I had some really amazing professors who also had small practices and taught part-
time and I just thought that would be a kind of perfect scenario where you’re alway affiliated 
with an institution but then you’re also out doing your own work. So that’s what I had imagined 
as I was graduating from my undergraduate degree. 
SF: 
How about your experiences at Princeton? Was that a nurturing environment for design or 
whatever? 
LB:  
No, well, no, I have to say Princeton provided a lot of what I did not get in my 
undergraduate which was much more theory courses and intellectual debate which was 
incredible so it was a really great flip-side to my undergraduate education. I was a bit 
disappointed in the studio sequence and even with my peers in studio, I think. The students that I 
was with both—there’s like a spectrum—the students like three years would be there about at the 
same time. And there were feeder schools, Georgia Tech being one of them, that had really 
strong design programs but then there were other schools that were much more intellectually 
heavy so it really created this mix of students who came in as really great designers but not 
intellectually mature and then the flip with very intellectually mature students that had never

designed anything. So Princeton was a real challenge in that it was incredibly competitive and 
super small. They had the smallest enrollment among all of the Ivy Leagues and at the time I was 
there they also were the most generous in fellowship and scholarship funding. So it produced an 
environment that could be a bit difficult. (laughs) 
SF: 
In what respect? 
LB: 
Well, everyone’s incredibly smart, super motivated, very opportunistic and—at least for 
me incredibly naive to many of these things—and there are a lot of very savvy students and I was 
not probably one of the more savvy students when I was there. I was incredibly focused on 
design and trying to play catch up in the intellectual realm of architecture and architecture theory. 
And, I mean, and because of the intensity—it’s a small building, it’s a small program—you really 
get to know your peers well within that context and I’ve noticed since graduating that other Ivy 
League students seem to keep in better touch than Princeton students, just more generally 
speaking. So it’s—it produces that kind of result in some ways, if that makes sense. 
SF: 
Yes, what about role models or mentors as you were going through Princeton or even 
women professors and studio teachers? 
LB: 
Right, well in undergrad I had very few female faculty and as it would happen, most of 
them were in the history courses. In the end there was one new junior faculty member, Annette 
Fierro who is now at University of Pennsylvania, who came in—started I think in my junior year 
or maybe my sophomore year—but I had her in my junior year and then she went to Paris. And 
at the time I was in Paris it was the first Iraq war and so faculty couldn’t leave so I ended up 
being taught by her twice and she became a really important mentor, the first female mentor I 
had. But then I also had several male mentors because I’d had so many male faculty and then 
getting to Princeton—it was apparently a really important—we were an important class because 
we were the first class that had fifty:fifty gender division. I mean it was so small, I had eight in 
my class so in some ways it’s not—okay four and four—but they made a big deal that it was the 
first class that had been admitted with gender parity. And there were some amazing women 
faculty there, who are still there, when I entered and I can’t— 
[00:15:00] 
I didn’t leave there with many mentors unfortunately. It just was a place for me that didn’t really 
provide that but to see these incredible women, incredibly successful, really well known and 
being taught by some of them did have an important impact on me and just—that models, seeing 
models that demonstrate You can do this too, I think is also really important. Although they 
didn’t become mentors, it was important to see these women and to be—but to hear them talk 
and to be around in that environment was incredibly important just in my own evolution. 
SF: 
So you were graduating and what were you thinking then in terms of where you wanted 
to go and who you wanted to work for?

LB: 
So I graduated in 1994 and I knew I would move to New York and I also—well I knew I 
would eventually get to New York but at the time there was a lot of building going on in Hong 
Kong and I’d never been to Asia so at that point in time that was really important—that was a 
place I wanted to go. And I knew that the work—it was kind of a mixed bag because the work 
would not be as great but to experience another part of the world be amazing. And before I set 
my sights on that, I did want to try and go back to Paris and see if I could find employment there 
first which I did for a few months but not enough to be able to sustain my existence there 
financially so I had to come back home.  
SF: 
So you first went to work for Pei Freed Cobb  & Partners so that was a Wow! 
LB: 
Yes, yes. So when I, yeah, well there’s a little bit that happened in between that became 
quite pivotal in my life. So when I came back from Paris, after grad school, this was in 
December of 94. My Mom ended up—she had cancer—and we didn’t find that out until a month 
after I returned—she had leukemia. And prior to her illness, the idea was I was going to become 
a famous architect like you know, I’d been taught by famous architects, I was really impassioned 
about architecture. And then my Mom got sick and my plans just basically were completely put 
on hold. We were incredibly close. And so I stayed in Atlanta during most of her illness which 
was very short. It was five months. I mean, we had no idea that was going to be the trajectory 
and so I ended up working for a local firm, just to make some money and to have something else 
to do besides visit and stay in the hospital with her. And after she passed away, it was June 1995, 
I—like that was earth-changing and I realized that being a famous architect wasn’t the most 
important thing anymore and that to just make a difference in the world was more important. I 
didn’t really know what that meant or how to do it but I knew that being famous wasn’t—like 
through architecture—in the sense that I thought after I graduated from Princeton something 
shifted. And so I did move to New York and I had a classmate who had been hired at Pei Cobb 
Freed [& Partners] so he helped me get that position. And that was my transition into New York 
City was working at Pei Cobb Freed. And that was rather short-lived because I wanted a 
permanent position and they were really slow. The GSD [Harvard Graduate School of Design] 
was a feeder school for them. There weren’t that many Princeton people there, I think just the 
two of us actually. And eventually because I was about to leave then they offered me a full-time 
position but I’d already accepted one at Gwathmey Siegel so I learned a lot while I was there but 
it wasn’t for that long a time. 
SF: 
And what kinds of projects were you working on then? 
LB: 
So at Pei Cobb Freed they were much larger cultural and institutional projects and I was a 
junior, junior architecture intern and so basically I would be picking up corrections on drawings 
and becoming more facile with AutoCad. And  
[00:20:00]

when I moved to Gwathmey Siegel, I began—I started working on more the residential side 
which was the Gwathmey side, that was the better—well that was the more interesting side in 
that office I think to be on and so I had—they started to give me more responsibility and working 
on very small teams which was a great experience and I learned so much and still am in touch 
actually with my kind of core teammates from Gwathmey-Siegel to this day.  
SF: 
That’s great. How long were you there? 
LB: 
I was there a year and a half and I would have stayed longer but they had a sudden 
downturn where jobs weren’t being—they had some in waiting but they weren’t being signed—
the contracts weren’t signed and lo and behold, I didn’t realize this at the time that I accepted the 
job, but they’re notorious—they were notorious for doing that—they would do all these hires and 
then as soon as there’s a dip in cash flow, they let people go. And so there were a few of us 
women that were let go—junior women—let go at the same time when I was.  
SF: 
Welcome to architecture 
LB: 
I know, exactly. It was so scary, living in New York, losing your job—like oh, my gosh, 
those two things were like—the fear. 
SF: 
So what did you do then? Go to Hong Kong? 
LB:  
So no, once my Mom passed away Hong Kong kind of went out the window and I ended 
up—one of the things Charlie Gwathmey would do if I guess he liked you and you were on his 
team, he would write letters and call his buddies around New York to help find you another job 
so he did that for me and I ended up going to—it’s Ennead Architects now but then it was 
Polshek and PartnersAnd I didn’t really want to take the job but I also knew I couldn’t be 
unemployed for a long period of time so I think I took a month off, did a competition, and then 
ended up taking the job. And that was not a great environment for me so I stayed there six 
months and then left. But at least I was able to land for a little while somewhere. 
SF: 
Yes. Not a great environment-the culture of the office or women? 
LB: 
Yeah, it was both. There was one female design partner but there was almost no women 
in leadership positions and definitely beyond that one partner who was a design partner, there 
were no other women even as design leads for projects. And it was a very male office, ahh—it 
felt—it was a bit overbearing. Some nice people but overall the culture, it just didn’t work for 
me. 
SF: 
So was that the you went to Hal Weiss Architects? 
Lori Brown Interview, July 2, 2020
Women Architects, afc2019/031

LB: 
Yes, yes and that was a great experience at Hal Weiss. She was on her own. She’d worked 
at Gluckman Mayner [Architects] for years and then went out on her own and it was just the two 
of us and I got so much experience both design, construction drawings, construction 
management, codes, building permitting—I mean the full gamut—writing specifications. It was 
incredible and I so hated—it was really disappointing when there was a downturn in projects and 
eventually she just couldn’t afford to keep me but that was a great—it was probably my best 
learning experience because I was able to do so many things. She gave me so much 
responsibility and autonomy. 
LB: 
And it was a woman so I mean that also in terms of just—I remember being amazed 
watching her on a job site with these contractors and just she wouldn’t take any BS. It was really 
empowering to see that. 
SF: 
And what were your experiences like on construction sites up until that point? 
LB: 
Well, I had not been on that many honestly until her office and you know it was clear that 
they didn’t often want to follow what I would say 
[00:25:00] 
and then Hallie would have to come later and reinforce what I was saying and then they would 
have to follow it so it really demonstrated some of the challenges that women have on job sites 
and not—and this is not uncommon but to see it play out between me, the younger woman and 
Hallie who was maybe in her late thirties, early forties and still having to fight with the 
contractors on a somewhat regular basis was, yeah, you become very aware of the power 
dynamics and learning how to navigate that space. 
SF: 
What did you decide to do then? Did you know exactly where you wanted to head or 
what you wanted in your career at this point 
LB: 
I thought, at that time so she hadn’t essentially let me go. She helped me find some part-
time work with some of her friends at another firm and I had also started to through some of 
these smaller jobs get connected with contractors so I was thinking, Well here is a chance to 
begin to maybe go our on my own if I could get a few jobs and just work out of my apartment. 
And I also—so that was kind of where I thought I was headed and then I had a former professor 
from Georgia Tech call me. It was early—it was either late July or early August and out of the 
blue he said, I need someone for the fall quarter—it could be for the whole year or you could try 
it for the fall—at Clemson. He was teaching at Clemson in South Carolina. Do you want to 
come? And he gave me a weekend to answer him. And I had been wanting to start to teach and I 
was finding it incredibly difficult to access the teaching scene in New York City so I thought, 
You know, why not. And at this moment there’s an actual kind of opening, almost like, there’s 
these two roads and they’re going to take me in two very different directions and I thought, If I 
teach I can still come back regularly and that practice could develop but that was really naive—I 
Lori Brown Interview, July 2, 2020
Women Architects, afc2019/031
10
mean in hindsight that was a naive thought. So I went and taught for what I thought would be a 
quarter and I loved it so much and they ended up needing someone for the following quarter, and 
then they also needed someone for the beginning of summer so I decided while I was there that I 
would apply for teaching jobs because I did not want to stay in the South even though it was a 
great first opportunity and that’s when I got the job at Syracuse—was through just sending out 
applications and going through that formal search process. And that really—I had no idea what I 
was getting into when I started to go into academia. I didn’t really understand that you needed a 
research agenda, that it’s not just being a good teacher, but you also have to be an academic and 
produce scholarly things, however one defines that within architecture. So it really changed the 
trajectory of my career significantly when I decided to move into academia.  
SF: 
Had you already taken your licensing exam before all of this? 
LB: 
So I had started while I was in New York and there were a few left and I think I passed 
one or two when I was at Clemson and then the last one I passed since I started Syracuse. I was 
determined—I mean I was going to get my license so it took me longer because of all these 
changes but yeah, whether I ever used it or not, in some ways did not matter but I wanted to be a 
licensed architect and kind of complete that cycle of education. 
SF: 
When you were teaching at Clemson what were the classes you were teaching there and 
what did you love about teaching? 
LB: 
So I was only teaching design studios. It was kind of the best of both worlds because I 
didn’t have to do any committee work or service and I was only teaching so I could just spend 
my time with students. And I loved the engagement and seeing students kind of get it 
[00:30:00] 
and their mind open and when they acquire certain skills, like they just—it was so exciting and 
brought me so much back to when I was a student and the professor Rob Miller—the one who 
invited me to Clemson—like he had a profound effect on me in my undergrad and so to be able 
to teach, not with him, but at the same institution and to be able to talk through and brainstorm 
pedagogical questions was really incredibly helpful as a very beginning design teacher. So I 
think it was the consolence—and I think there were a few new faculty as well—so there was this 
really great mix and energy of us. And then—I was not that much older than the students. I was 
in my early, early thirties and maybe I was just thirty—so although older, there was still a—it 
wasn’t that much older. It’s not like now. (laughs) But yeah and I think just—you know and 
Clemson is in the middle of nowhere so there’s nothing else to do but really focus on teaching.   
SF: 
In reading about you I keep coming upon where you talk about yourself at “the 
intersections of architecture, art, geography and women’s studies” and your belief that 
“architecture can participate in impacting people’s everyday lives”. How did that all develop and 
Lori Brown Interview, July 2, 2020
Women Architects, afc2019/031
11
how did all of those aspects sort of come together? Was that as a result of your teaching o r your 
practice? 
LB: 
Well, there’s many different, I think, things has brought that all together. One as I 
mentioned, in high school I took a lot of art classes and I continued doing various types of art 
and making in that way throughout, actually I mean, I still do some things.  And I at one point 
when I’d moved to New York I’d started to think about, Well should I pursue more of a career in 
art and you know maybe architecture would fall by the wayside? And that didn’t happen so 
there’s always been that interest in how art and architecture intersect and the influences between 
the two during some periods of time are really important and so that has always been an interest 
of mine from at least high school onwards and then becoming more aware of the lack of gender 
parity and equity. There were times in my undergraduate education where I was the only female 
student in my design studio and at the time I went to a technical institute so sadly that was not 
uncommon. Now it would be much more uncommon and should be—it should not happen at all 
but at the time it was somewhat expected, I hate to say, and as I went through and then at 
Princeton seeing that there are these important women in the discipline who are making an 
amazing impact and have great influence. And starting to see in practice where women still 
aren’t receiving enough acknowledgements and awareness of their contributions it was like this 
slow evolution of beginning to see there is a direct need to help support women and people of 
color to help diversify the discipline. And also to look at spaces that are inherently, that 
inherently affect women and that—I was never taught about any of these kind of things as an 
undergrad student. In grad school there was a seminar with Mark Wigley where he—for me it 
was foundational because it was really about these intersections between art, architecture and 
theory and he brought in different art practices, different architectural practices to show and talk 
about the relationships between space and gender and politics. And so as I was evolving in my 
own thinking and these experiences where women just were not—there weren’t enough women, 
they weren’t leading in the way that I think they should be—it provided an opportunity when I 
became a full-time professor to start to think about how can I become more— 
[00:35:00] 
how can my work contribute to changing that? And in part, early on when I was at Syracuse, it 
was maybe my second or third year, there were a group of undergraduate female students who 
came up to me and started talking about their frustration of not learning enough about women 
and their history in theory courses or in their design courses and like this is just not acceptable 
and I realized literally at that moment that I can no longer empathize because that was my 
experience but I have to now work to change it. And it was—you know when sometimes in life 
you have these moments where you look back and you know this was really a moment that 
redirected the course of your life. Well, those students—and I tell them—I mean I’ve 
acknowledged it over and over again—really changed or made more clear what I wanted to do 
and how I wanted to do it and what kind of contribution I’d like to make. And so it was at that 
point where I started to focus more explicitly on the relationship of gender and space and having 
work, looking at work, researching, designing an explicitly certain kinds of spacial situations 
Lori Brown Interview, July 2, 2020

whether it’s—recently incarcerated women being released from prison and spaces to enable them 
to be with their children again and to abortion clinics, to women’s shelters. Like it kind of pushed 
me to be far more aggressive about the ways we need to be thinking as architects in these 
everyday spaces that are ignored and not so significant within what would be referred to as the 
cannon of architecture.  
SF: 
How has that impacted then how you teach your students? How do you help them gain 
the foundational skills to be an architect and yet have the sensitivity to the issues you’re talking 
about? 
LB: 
It’s been really significant. And you know, not that my education was—I had a great 
education—but I decided that I don’t want to teach in the way I was taught in the sense that to be 
an architect in the world with all of these problems, with all of these needs—we have such an 
ability to help change people’s lives. So to have them have to reconcile and think about these 
very banal types of spaces whether it’s waste plants or transit hubs—now transit hubs have 
become a bit more popular to think about especially given the need and necessity of thinking 
more sustainably. But even thinking about public housing and bringing in these different voices 
and so that’s where my teaching really diverges from the way I was taught. I want these other 
voices to be a part of what students have to think about to be a more informed and thoughtful 
designer. So to read about people’s experiences living in social housing, to read about the impact 
of waste and how can we think about more efficient systems of waste and how it works say in a 
city like New York—where are those gaps in networks where we could be providing a different 
way to think about the movement of these materials through the urban landscape and bringing in 
these voices in these different readings. And to have them really—and I mean this in a positive 
way—struggle with what does it mean to have to think about your role as an architect in the built 
environment in these places that often are not very esthetically pleasing. And we need as a 
discipline to be really taking this on. So for me, it’s imperative that I require students to have to 
think about these things.   
SF: 
Do you think that women produce a different kind of architecture or a different quality of 
architecture than men? Do they come at differently? 
LB: 
Well, I think—I always get this question— 
[00:40:00] 
although it’s usually asked, “Do women design differently than men?” And of course not, I don’t 
see design as a gendered practice but what I do see is that one’s lived experiences are very 
different and what women encounter on a daily basis is very different from what men encounter. 
As so to think about what does it mean to walk through a city street when you’re a woman verses 
a man? What do you think about in housing to create a better engagement between dealing with 
children and having to prepare dinner? That’s not gendered per se but a woman’s experience of 
those things and those spacial relationships are different than a man’s. And unfortunately that’s 
Lori Brown Interview, July 2, 2020

very much about the way we’ve been socialized and the inherent gender structures that we still 
operate within—so not that we design differently but what we’re thinking about is different 
because our life experiences are different. And I want to foreground those things because then it 
helps students become, one—more aware how different people walk through life and that 
informs how you think about operating as a designer and as an architect. 
SF: 
Do you think that women work with clients differently than men? 
LB: 
Hmm. I think, I mean I really try not to essentialize based on gender but I think—I mean 
I can speak from my own experiences in relationship to say the men who I’ve been working with 
or working under in these firms and I think we do think about use and need maybe in slightly 
different ways because of the way we’ve been socialized. So thinking about when I worked at 
Gwathmey Siegel and I had to do all of these cabinet designs, furniture designs for a really 
wealthy family, and thinking about—you know kind of like walking through someone’s day and 
what kind of spaces do they need. Where do they need to store things? Where do they need to air 
things out? Like not that men can’t or don’t think about it, I just think we may—our experiences 
are different that way. So there are—there are—that does result in differences of approaches, I 
think. 
SF: 
Do you think we are moving away from that whole “starchitect” or star architect where 
the architect’s sort of this free-spirited creative genius who swoops in to solve the problem and 
maybe everything is not so client need centered? 
LB: 
I hope so. I really hope and I work very hard to try and deconstruct the star architect 
obsession. I mean, I as a student, I was just like that because you’re taught to emulate these few 
people but I really work—and the kinds of projects I ask students to do, the kinds of readings and 
references I give them very much downplays the star architect and really tries to teach a more 
collaborative, non-hierarchical way to engage and work with their classmates which will 
hopefully lead toward changes in the discipline. But the star architect—it is so problematic, still. 
Yeah, it does nothing to help the discipline at all. 
SF: 
you’ve written and lectured and then edited a book called Feminist Practices: 
Interdisciplinary Approaches to Women in Architecture so could you talk a little bit about that 
book and what you mean by feminist or feminist practices. 
LB: 
So as I mentioned that I had these undergraduate female students that came to me and 
wanting to know about more women so this—it began as an exhibition—in many ways a direct 
response to their questioning and I was interested  
[00:45:00] 
in bringing together a diverse group of women who were practicing at a variety of scales in ways 
that I was arguing they were feminist practices. I had a few debates with some of those I 
Lori Brown Interview, July 2, 2020
Women Architects, afc2019/031
14
included. They didn’t really want to be labeled as feminists or really didn’t think they were 
feminists that eventually I was able to convince them that in fact they were operating that way 
even if they didn’t identify as such. And it had been at least ten or fifteen years from the last 
publication in the US about women in architecture and so it was really important to try and have 
a diverse range of like from women looking at the body to looking at design/build with students 
to urban scaled projects to more research based projects and I was interested in just showing how 
or demonstrating through these examples that there’s—it doesn’t have to be focused on women 
to be feminist. But the way that these different women were operating was speaking about a 
series of issues that for me were explicitly feminist whether it was the way they engaged with 
clients so that it was very much a collaboration and not a top down approach—which if we go 
back to the star architects one can see happening quite often to looking at the body. There was 
one installation in the Toronto Design Exchange where Cynthia Hammond was looking at air 
ventilation in the women’s rest room and just like things that in some way people would not 
think about regularly and foregrounding how all of these things really affect your body in space. 
And so that began as an exhibition, toured around the country, and then Australia and then 
transitioned into an edited collection, my first publication, first book, that also I was able to do a 
lot of book talks and start to build a broader network of people in the country and abroad 
interested in similar topics. 
SF: 
So, have you kept in touch with some of these women and followed their projects and 
have you seen their projects expand into other areas or have an impact that they didn’t expect? 
LB: 
Hmm. That’s a great question. I am in touch with almost all of them sporadically and I 
think actually all of them in various ways have continued in these types of engagements. Some 
remaining more practice based and then some really transitioning to full-time academic. And 
yeah, that’s a really—and I thought about actually doing a version two like ten or fifteen years 
out to see—to invite them to include someone else so it would expand by one times the number 
that were in the book so that it continues to build the network. But I think they—I think they’re 
all actually—and especially the ones where I had to talk through why I thought they were 
feminists, now they’re unabashedly feminists but at the time they didn’t really see it that way. 
And I think as people get older and get more life experiences you also and especially I find this 
true for women, especially, there such ages in our society and I think you encounter other types 
of obstacles as you move forward in your career. And I think that’s also allowed some of these 
women to become more active and more explicitly engaged in some of these issues than they 
were nine years ago. 
SF: 
You have described yourself as an architect activist. So your second book if you could 
talk about that,  
[00:50:00] 
Contested Space: Abortion Clinics, Women’s Shelters and Hospitals and the importance of that  
book and the work that you’re doing there. 
Lori Brown Interview, July 2, 2020
Women Architects, afc2019/031

LB: 
So I was really interested in taking on something explicitly polarizing and engendered 
and I’m not sure there is any other space more polarizing than abortion clinics in many parts of 
the world. And I started this research not very aware of say the broader implications this may 
have because it is so polarizing but I was interested not so much how abortion clinics are 
designed but more that the legal—how would I say it—how laws affect what space can be or do 
or how it can perform. So the legal implications that we as architects have to contend with, 
which has led to a number of other projects still working along that line of thought. And I also 
included women’s shelters and hospitals because I had done some work locally with a women’s 
shelter and then began to be asked to review women’s shelter proposals and guidelines until I 
started to realize that there’s actually some similarities in both in issues of security and the kind 
of polarization of women’s shelters or the way they’re understood in this country. And then 
hospitals also have an incredible degree of security that I had not really thought about until 
starting to bring these three building types together. And they’re each—I would say hospitals are 
probably the most intentionally designed to think about security and to think for example the 
imbedding of the birthing area, the natal suite, because of the issues of making sure no one can 
just—anyone can walk into the room where the newborns are or to where the pharmacy is for 
that example so there’s lots of security that has a spatialized component in hospitals and then 
within abortion clinics which the book is primarily—I mean the majority of the material in that 
book is really focused on abortion clinics and I was interested first in just understanding the way 
they operated spatially and then looking at the legal structures around them and especially in 
very conservative states. And so in the end I traveled to many of the states where there were 
independent providers and interviewed them and had tours of their spaces and learned a lot about 
how they navigate this very contested terrain still between the built environment, public space 
and a woman’s federally guaranteed right to be able to access an abortion clinic. And I lectured 
widely on this material—on that research which has led to also looking at building codes where 
prior to 2016 there were a number of states using building codes—changing of building codes 
for explicit reasons for abortion clinics under the rhetoric of making them safer for a woman but 
in fact they were more just political machinations to close the clinic. So it began—so the 
activism part really started to become—I became more invested in that after doing the abortion 
research because I realized there was such a need for architecture expertise in these areas that are 
heavily politicized in this country. So for example, I’ve served as an expert witness for the 
ACLU Freedom Project where they’ve asked me to talk about certain building code changes that 
in no way improve the health or safety—the life or safety for the building and the users of the 
building. I created a series of diagrams to help lawyers argue before the courts why these 
changes were absolutely not useful. And then wanting to work with—there was an opportunity to 
work with some abortion clinics—a clinic in Mississippi and a clinic in Alabama and those have 
not been built yet but I’m hoping the one in Alabama will eventually be built.  
[00:55:00] 
It’s a public space interface that creates more security but also creates a better experience on both 
sides of what would be a wall and there’s landscaping and shading for those who have to wait 
Lori Brown Interview, July 2, 2020
Women Architects, afc2019/031

outside for their friend or loved one who are inside. So there’s—through doing this work there’s 
become all these opportunities to really be engaged in the broader public and the debate about 
space and the role that design can play and participate in—in space. And that was never the goal 
or goals starting out but it’s just opened up all these other doors where I find a lot of amazing 
people and a lot of energy that I want to invest to help them, work with them. 
SF: 
It was heartbreaking reading some of your stories and then photographs detention centers 
for immigrants and all of theses spaces. And you’ve been pretty vocal about architects should as 
a profession should become more involved in social justice issues. So how would you like to see 
them do that? 
LB: 
Well I think—so I guess I should preface that I know that I have a certain privilege being 
in the academy where I don’t—I’m not reliant on clients for my livelihood so I feel I need and 
want to use this privilege to help advance where architects can contribute. I know, having spoken 
to architects in the South, and actually ones in Mississippi who could never publicly say they 
support the clinic in the city because they’ll lose their livelihood. And I think as a discipline, we 
need to be far more forthright in these issues and if we did it collectively I think there’d be far 
less—I would hope there’d be far less ramifications on people’s livelihoods if we took more—if 
we were more proactive in speaking out for these kinds of spaces and helping make—helping 
working with those underprivileged constituents. So I think we as a discipline are way too timid 
and don’t take enough risks around these issues. But so I know it’s a—it’s a —flipped too 
because I understand that you don’t want to go out of business but yet there’s also the kind of 
ethics around these things too. 
SF: 
You’ve also been instrumental in creating resources to address equity and diversity and 
inclusion in the profession. One of them you mentioned was ArchiteXX which you cofounded. 
You’ve done some amazing things to  heighten awareness. Could you talk a little bit about how 
you see that as a resource for women and also male professionals. 
LB: 
So we’ve done a number of mini—I think really important things. Our mission is really 
about bridging between the academy and practice. My co-founder, Anita Freedman, whose no 
longer a part of it was in practice solely and I was in the academy solely and we realized that 
there’s all these amazing opportunities to help work between and we wanted to create an 
organization that would enable and support those kind of endeavors to happen. And it would help 
provide a network of young women coming out of schools to hopefully help them find 
employment and to find jobs and firms that they want to be in that have really good—that would 
have better labor practices and better equity. And so we—our programing kind of hovers or not 
hovers but is between these two realms. So we do—we’ve done workshops about salary 
negotiation. We’ve created—for a year we were working with NYU for a high school program to 
try to encourage more students of color to think about considering architecture for their college 
experience and education.  
Lori Brown Interview, July 2, 2020
Women Architects, afc2019/031

[01:00:00] 
We have created what we call a “University Brown Bag” programming where we work with 
students in schools of architecture and programs of architecture across New York State. And 
faculty to bring more women in to talk about the kind of work they do. One thing we noticed was 
that women are not being invited to the same degree that our male counterparts are to give 
lectures in schools of architecture. And I kept data on this for about four and one half years and it 
was kind of astounding how—I mean there were certain areas of the country where no women 
were on the lecture series and then a vast majority where there’d be one woman but there wasn’t 
a large constituency where there were—say half the lecturers were women. So the university, the 
Brown Bag series, allows—provides a way for more women to talk to students about what 
they’re doing and hopefully then eventually become invited on to the school’s primary lecture 
series. We also have—we’ve done two exhibits—the first one was around my research on the 
abortion clinic in Mississippi where we had a call for design ideas asking for anyone and 
everyone to provide a postcard of a design idea for the clinic in Mississippi about the public 
space—how to create a really more secure but more aesthetically rich interface that would 
respect the right to protest but also respect the right to be able to enter into the clinic. And we had 
some really great programming and that was at the New School back in 2014 and most recently 
we have a traveling exhibition called “Now What? - Advocacy, Activism and Alliance in 
American Architecture Since 1968”. And we were interested first, we as an organization are 
really interested in expanding the way we think about who can practice and how people practice 
architecture and we also realize there’s a rich history of this that has not been written. And that 
we wanted this exhibit to begin to help create this history. It will become a book. We have an 
online catalog that’s continually being updated and we see this as an archive always in the 
making so as it travels across the country we ask for local content to be added while the 
exhibition is in place so we have tabs and you pin them in and you write down local content that 
will then be translated into the exhibition as it moves on and it’s become—it’s an incredible 
resource for right now using a lot of the material around black architects to help raise awareness 
and support. The black designers now since the killing of George Floyd, and this has been 
incredibly well received. And students when we’ve gone and lectured at various institutions 
across the country—students are kind of blown away that so much of this history is not—they’re 
not taught. And we see this as really instrumental in changing the future of the discipline because 
it’s going to create new material for students to learn from and it is creating that. It’s creating 
ways to build new alliances. As it travels we bring in different organizations to talk about what 
they’re doing. So it’s both activist and academic at the same time which is very much how I see 
myself and how I operate in the world. And it’s changing the future of the history of architecture. 
And that’s really important. Women, people of color, and the voices, and their voices, and the 
kinds of work that they’re passionate about get highlighted. 
SF: 
And the I guess you’re doing the same thing through ArchiteXX with the Wiki 
 
LB: 
Yes, so we also have—thank you, I’d forgotten about that—so a friend and colleague of 
mine, Despina Stratigakos, who’s an architectural historian at Buffalo, she wrote a really 
Lori Brown Interview, July 2, 2020
Women Architects, afc2019/031
18
important essay in “Places” about basically editing women out of history. And when I read it, I 
was like, we’ve got to do something and so why can’t we just write more women in to 
Wikipedia, and we know, I mean I’m not going to say Wikipedia is the source but it is the source 
everyone goes to in the beginning and if there aren’t  
[01:05:00] 
enough women in Wikipedia then people aren’t, definitely in the broader public, aren’t going to 
understand that there are a lot of women architects. So with the architects we came up with an 
idea. I emailed everyone I knew in the world who may be interested and I’ve had such positive 
feedback and engagement that we’ve made it an annual event and we collaborate with 
organizations across the world to write more women into Wikipedia. And we’ve gotten the 
funding from the Wikipedia Foundation to do this. We’ve collaborated and been at the 
Guggenheim and at the Bard’s Graduate Center in New York. So this is something that is 
profound because as you’re writing —I mean I’ve found that there’s such a responsibility when 
I’m writing these entries that you don’t want to mess up and then you’re also adding to it which 
is amazing and teaching students to do it so we run them in schools and we work with 
architecture history classes and it’s—students get super excited that they can write their professor 
in and that’s important. That’s really changing the demographics of representation. 
SF: 
Well I have to say the book Where Are the Women Architects that you mentioned, that 
really prompted me to write the grant to do these interviews. So hopefully the— and the Library 
of Congress is very interested so hopefully it is something we will be able to continue. 
LB: 
Oh wow! Oh, that’s fantastic. Okay. 
SF: 
So where are you in your career today? You know things that you want to accomplish, 
projects that you would like to work on? 
LB: 
Oh, yeah, of course. I feel like there’s never enough time. I’m currently co-editing with 
Karen Burns, a friend and colleague out of the University of Melbourne, the Bloomsbury Global 
Encyclopedia of Women in Architecture, 1960 - 2015. And that expected publication date is 2021 
so we’re really in the throes of the entries and editing for the upcoming next several months, well 
actually probably through the end of the year to get the manuscript to the publisher. And this 
project is going to be a game changer also globally because we haven’t read that much read but 
what we have seen—we have amazing representation from countries that at least through the 
Western lens, we know so little about—so Africa, the Middle East, parts of Asia. Like this is 
going to be—no one can say after this that we just don’t know where to find women as architects 
because it’s over eleven hundred entries and it’s both the most well known and then the goal was 
to try and highlight as many women that one has never heard of as possible. So it’s a mix. It’s 
definitely a combination. We have ten area editors who oversee each of the regions. Each area 
editor will be writing an introductory essay to their region within this timeframe and then Karen 
and I are writing the broader introduction to position this through a transnational, intersectional 
Lori Brown Interview, July 2, 2020
Women Architects, afc2019/031
19
lens to really intervene if not completely alter the way people think about the canon of 
architecture from this point forward. And we—it’s both, I mean it’s an incredibly scholarly 
project but we both as activist feminists, see it as very much an activist project as well and we’re 
building this incredible network, global network of women, mostly women, there are some male 
contributors writing about women across the globe and I think it’s going to be profound. 
SF: 
That is so exciting and so needed.   
LB: 
Yes and it will be in print and there will also be a digital format. So it will be hopefully 
more accessible for certain parts of the world. And then Karen and I—so through this research 
we have become really interested in the UN and the role the UN has played to help advance 
women from the Global Souths ideas about feminism or the way  
[01:10:00] 
they’ve been able to push and evolve—the evolution of women’s contributions. So our next 
project will be looking at the UN and its role for women in the built environment once we finish 
this one. So, yeah, it’s been amazing just to come to understand the role habitat has played and 
all of the UN conferences on women have played. I mean not without critique of course but it’s 
been instrumental in getting gender out in to a kind of mainstream way of thinking and 
conversation and development—urban development that needs to be researched and written 
about.  
And you know, in terms of like there’s the border research that you mentioned that I’m—that’s 
going to become a book so I’m in the throes of that as well and then wanting to keep going with 
issues around social justice and space and I don’t—wanting to collaborate in an interdisciplinary 
way with those who can—well we can make a real difference in the world like in the built 
environment. I think, I like working between both being a scholar, being an activist, and being a 
designer. I’ve been doing less designing of late in a more conventional sense but I see actually 
the way I’m able to collaborate and connect with people across the world as a form of designing 
as well, designing networks, designing engagement so I will be doing that for the rest of my life. 
SF: 
That’s powerful. And I can see contested spaces when you think of the UN and then you 
think of women in all of the many sorts of spaces they are sometimes confined to and how that 
needs to change. Something needs to happen to provide better spaces. 
LB: 
Yes, for sure.  
SF: 
What do you wish—is there something you wish you had known before you started in 
architecture? 
LB: 
Yeah, I—and I know this may sound naive but I remember when I was in Paris and for 
some reason, when I first visited Sacré-Cœur which is up in the north of Paris and I was so 
Lori Brown Interview, July 2, 2020
Women Architects, afc2019/031
20
moved by the spaces that could create such a visceral impact in someone and I knew that’s what I 
wanted to do but as I’ve become more aware of the role of law and politics and economics, I 
realize that it’s not just design, but it’s all of these other issues which in many ways are far more 
influential in what the built environment can become that need to be understood more broadly as 
a designer and as an architect. So if and that’s—I mean it’s only because of my life experiences 
and interests that I’ve become aware of that but I was just talking to a friend the other day saying 
how when I was in fourth grade, I wanted to be a lawyer and somehow then the creative side 
took over but it’s like you know someday I still think to have a law degree would be so useful in 
so many of these cases and the spaces I’m interested in looking at and gauging and designing 
through because at the heart of what’s possible, at least in this country is the legal framework. 
And that impacts space so directly and I don’t think—so that’s another—it goes back to how I 
teach—like I want students to understand that you have to—you’re not just designing in a 
vacuum. They’re all of these forces at play, architecture is but one and to be more—to be 
educated and aware about these larger legal frameworks can only benefit your ability to operate 
within them and to push back on them. So I think I am never one to say, Oh I wish I would have 
done this but I think the law piece is a really critical one and I have been contemplating ways to 
not necessarily get a law degree but become more versed  
[01:15:00]  
in issues of law. And I just didn’t know that—I mean we didn’t—my parents didn’t have a lot of 
friends that were lawyers and you don’t really know what that means often, I don’t think. 
SF: 
What do you see as the possibilities for the future for your students for the people in these 
contested spaces and having to live through those. What are some of the possibilities you could 
envision for the future? 
LB: 
Well, I want to say I’m incredibly inspired and hopeful by my students and I know that 
they’re invested in a more just future and they have a certain amount of tenacity that they’re not 
going to accept no now. And I think that can only bode well for our future and I see it even this 
summer after George Floyd’s killing, a lot of students emailed me and said they—no one’s 
internship’s really happened or so few have. They’re all at home. We want to do something—like 
we can’t just sit here anymore and so we started organizing on line to have a series of 
discussions, reading sessions. We had a virtual town hall to talk about how they’re all doing and 
how they’re feeling right now. And they are committed and they’re also committed to altering the 
curriculum of architectural education and it is incredibly inspiring to see—they are fearless. And 
it is just—I mean I am so moved and all I want to do is push them forward as much as I can so I 
think their future is going to be really challenging given the economic situation we’re in and will 
continue to be in. I think the climate crisis is huge—I mean the most critical thing we all need to 
be thinking about that’s going to fall on them so much more than it falls on us but they care and 
they’re working towards making change and that is so inspirational to me.  
Lori Brown Interview, July 2, 2020

SF: 
YOU’re such a passionate teacher and I’m sure your students relish the fact they can 
explore all of these different issues with you and through you. 
LB: 
Well, thank you.  
SF: 
If you could change the profession what would you do? 
LB: 
I think we need to be invested far more in the civil aspects of what we do and I think 
having requirements of students to have to be public servants within their education would be 
instrumental in starting to further change the way architects understand the benefits of what they 
bring to society at large. I think because we’re within still this capitalist system, it’s really, it 
becomes an issue of economic survival for a lot of firms just to keep going and so it’s hard for 
them to do pro bono work or to do work that doesn’t pay as much but I think if we want to shift 
the—both the public’s understanding of what we do and what we give back—we have to start to 
put in place ways that we do that from education onwards. It also used to be within the licensing 
when you were acquiring your hours to sit for your exam, your licensing exam, part of it, there 
was a piece that had to do with volunteer hours. They’ve eliminated that as well so it’s as if the 
profession just does not value the kind of volunteer and contributions we can make at large and 
so that I haven’t had time to work on but that’s something kind of on my back list to really start 
to speak out about as well. I also think, I mean not just because of what we’re going through with 
a lot of the civil protests  
[01:20:00] 
and conversations around race and racism but architecture remains a white discipline and we 
have to diversify the discipline to be far more responsive to the population. And that’s going to 
take much more effort and financial willingness on the parts of institutions, granting 
organizations, higher ed, to make this happen. And it has to happen, it cannot remain the way it is 
moving forward. And one of the things that’s so inspiring for me with all of the protests is that 
this is now front and center and we have to make sure it remains front and center so that all of 
these bastions of white supremacy are eliminated. And that’s going to take years and years but 
we have to start. And architecture is one of the whitest disciplines that remain. And I think 
women, within that, there’s also women are still not paid equally. We still aren’t in enough 
positions of leadership so there’s work all around in the discipline of architecture that needs to be 
done.  
SF: 
And you won the AIA Diversity Best Practices Honorable Mention Award. Does a lot of 
this really need to come from the heart of the AIA before change will happen? 
LB: 
No, I mean I think the AIA needs to change but I don’t look for them to be the leaders in 
the change. I think institutions of higher ed have to change. I think clients have to require that 
more people of color—that they work with people of color. I know the Beverly Willis 
Architecture Foundation has a program where they work with kind of C-Suite people to educate 
Lori Brown Interview, July 2, 2020
Women Architects, afc2019/031

them about why the need for more diverse architecture firms is so critical and they’ve had some 
success I think in helping educate potential clients about that. And I think it has to come from 
both the top down and the bottom up but I don’t look for the AIA to be the leader in this. I mean 
they’ve been—and I am a member of the AIA but I’m not overly invested in it for change. Like I 
work outside of it to push back. 
SF: 
Are there any stories or projects you would like to add? 
LB: 
There is a—it informed part of my work in the Contested Spaces book that I did discuss a 
little bit which was working on a women’s shelter renovation in Syracuse and I bring it up 
because it was the first time that I used my architecture stamp, my license, and I remember I was 
so excited about this project because it was going to help the lives of these women who were 
living temporarily in a women’s shelter and there were so many difficulties with the organization 
and the lack of understanding value of what an architect brings and I just realized in that 
experience that one should never give away their expertise for free, that there has to be an 
exchange in value whether its drastically reduced or not but when you give it away people 
actually don’t value it and I just—I was coming from a place of just wanting to volunteer in my 
community and it was a pretty time intensive project and the contractors were getting paid and 
they did have another volunteer group doing some work but I realized that the contractors were 
bing treated differently than I was because there’s a value exchange and it really—so after that 
experience and when I talk about with students what kind of work do you want to do and when 
they talk about volunteer efforts, I’m always trying to encourage them to not do anything for free
—that their labor is not in some way compensated for because it just made me realize like when 
we do that we’re devaluing our expertise and the discipline at large 
[01:25:00] 
and it was a really important learning experience moving forward in terms of how one—like I 
want to work with those types of organizations who don’t think they can afford architects or 
don’t even know what we do but there has to be some sort of exchange and so that was an 
important lesson to learn from that. 
SF: 
What do you think your legacy will be? 
LB: 
Oh wow, huh, well if I hope that far more women’s contributions become known as a 
result of the work I do. I hope that where and how architects operate in the world, changes and 
expands to take on and work with some of the most underprivileged communities that need help, 
need their spaces to improve. And I think, I also hope that architects start to understand that we 
can bring a lot of expertise into areas that strictly aren’t about building. So I guess expanding the 
discipline’s contribution to society. I aspire for that to be a part of my legacy. And helping 
support and mentor those younger than me as they move forward, like really help lift and push 
them forward. Yeah, I mean, I had some really important people who are still in my life do that

and I think one can never have enough. There can always be more support and mentoring, yeah. I 
hadn’t thought about that question honestly. That’s really—I mean ultimately, I just want to make 
a difference in the world, is really the bottom line for me. 
SF: 
Well I think you are definitely, I can’t—hearing how you are still working—continuing to 
work with your students through the issues now that are front and center and I imagine your 
studios are pretty amazing, and mind provoking, and requiring a lot of hard work but definitely 
make for better architects. Well is there anything else that you’d like to add, any other stories 
or…  
LB: 
No, I think that’s it. Thank you so much. I’m so honored to be included. 
SF: 
Well thank you. And I actually discussed with several people, maybe we need to do this 
again in five years, come back and touch base and see… 
LB: 
That would be great! 
SF: 
Well, you have been very generous with your time. Thank you so much.   
LB: 
Oh, my pleasure.
