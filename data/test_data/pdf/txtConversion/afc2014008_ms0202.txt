 I
 made my collections exclusively fro m peasants and f
ro m people who e
ither were an essential part o
f v
illage co m munity
 
l
ife or else f
itted musically i
nto this l
ife by functions which gave the m importance i
n i
t (
gypsy violin p
layers)... But even
 
with the restriction of our choice to peasants and to village gypsies, so me sort o
f selection will be necessary.  I
t i
s not only
 
the mere for m of the melodies we have to care about, but a
lso whether t
he perfor mance and the s
inging t
echnic o
f the s
ingers
 
have been spoiled by urban i
nfluence... Fortunately, a
t t
he t
i me o
f t
he collection whole areas were s
till a
l most co mpletely
 
i
lliterate in Bihor, Hunedoara, and Mara mures .
.. As might be expected, wo men were much more reliable i
n maintaining the
 
rural s
tyle o
f perfor mance.  Men were more subject to wandering; a
lso, co mpulsory military service tore the m away f
ro m
 
their ho mes. 8

I
've s
tarted here a very interesting but, as a
lways, l
ong-drawn-out t
ask--one that I
 had never t
ried to do before.  S
trictly
 
speaking i
t i
sn't a musical labor.  I
 am c
leaning up and collating Wallachian folk-song t
exts---2000 o
f t
he m! .
.. I
 t
hink many
 
i
nteresting t
hings will emerge fro m this--pertaining to peasants, I
 mean.  For exa mple, t
hat t
o be j
ilted, abandoned, i
s a
 
bigger malheur for the g
irl than for the lad.  Of course, we knew this a
ll a
long but now i
t can be proven b
lack on white with
 
s
tatistical data.  Then, that g
irls (or wo men) are so much more vehe ment, full o
f fury than men.  We kne w t
his too, d
idn't
 
we? .
.. These imprecations, by the way, are extre mely curious.  What a Shakespearian fantasy i
s revealed i
n t
he m!  I
t's
 
quite amazing.  Alas, I
 can't quote to you fro m the Wallachian because you wouldn't understand t
hat tongue. 9

f t
he v
irtuoso dru m and xylophone p

f Seth Ladzikpo and Kakraba Lobi (Ghana), the
 
Hungarian folk t
unes p
layed on t
he f

tring f
iddle dan-nhi by Tran
 
Van Khe (Vietna m), and the dazzling perfor mance i
n t
he mode o
f segah p
layed on t

Iran).  Shanto Rao,
 
acco mpanied by her i
nstru mental ense mble, gave an artistic perfor mance o
f t

char med t

laying o
f Rokudan by Yatsuhashi Kengyo (
1619-1685) on t
he koto.  An outstanding f
eature o
f the con-
f
erence was the l
ecture-de monstration on t

infonietta by Villa- Lobos, and an early opera
 
by Kodaly, Szekely Pono (The Spinning Roo m) i
n concert for m, a
 work which makes generous use o
f Hungarian folk melodies.
 
By bringing t
ogether i
n c
lose association and exchange co mposers, e
thno musicologists, and folklorists the conference
 
achieved a desirable goal.  Conte mporary co mposers have been reluctant t
o exa mine the folk music o
f their own culture and t
he
 
music o
f t
he Orient has held l
ittle i
nterest for t

low i

tte mpting to relate t

f t

o t
he develop ment o
f art music.  The conference succeeded not only i
n widening t
he horizons o
f the
 
delegates within t
heir i
ndividual d
isciplines but a
lso i
nto t
he universal world o
f music t

!Black Orpheus" and "Ersatz," a short
 
subject, will be presented Saturday
 
afternoon, June 8, at 2:30 P.M.  in the

whether or not we can continue.

"The legend of Orpheus has attracted poets ranging from Horace to
 
Rilke; Gluck used the theme for a revolutionary opera, Tennessee
 
Williams and Jean Anouilh for contemporary plays, Balanchine for a
 
ballet, Cocteau for a film.
 Now it forms the basis of a stunning
 
film made in Brazil by a French director, Marcel Camus, whose
 
Brazilian Negro players speak their native variety of Portuguese.
 
The movie has been hailed as the most unusual of the many made by
 
the 'new wave'  of French directors, examples of whose work are
 
currently invading the art houses....  Cannes made it official by
 
awarding its grand prize to "Orph6e Ndgre;'or "Black Orpheus," as it
 
is titled here.
 Without doubt, it is a quite marvelous film
 
experience, blending really gorgeous color, hypnotizing sound and
 
music, the frenetic hi-jinks of the Rio Carnival, and a furious
 
display of energy by a largely amateur group of actors." ,

Hootenanny 
Richard Lynn, of 16409 Alora Ave., Norwalk,
 
is hosting a small hoot Saturday night,
 
May 25, with tuning in at 7:00 P.M.
 
The main interest is in traditional Appalachian material, mainly
 
that in the Child collection.
 Secondary interests include Carter
 
Family.
 Instruments of special interest will be dulcimer, autoharp,
 
and unaccompanied voice.
 
.An invitation is extended to those sharing similar interests.
 
Respect for the material is important; virtuosity and vocal quality
 
are not.
 The street is not shown on most maps,  so phone UN5-8663 first.

Alice Conklin
 
Newport Folk Festival
 
#3 Washington Square Vilkage
 
"
'ew York 12, New York
 
Dear Alice Conklin:
 
Thank you so much for your nice letter invi-
ting .
ne to the Newport Festival.  I would like very much to come,
 
though I do not feel that it would be wise to book me as a per-
former on the evening concerts.
 I think I could be of some use
 
in workshop situations, but I am not a performer by temperament,
 
talent or experience.
 
The term workshop is used so variously in
 
different situations to cover panel discussions, lectures,
 
general g4estion and answer sessions as well as participating
 
meetin s  that I would appreciate I
tnowing just how the :
.
"ewport
 
Festival uses the ter
ra.  Here at UCLA we leaned more toward
 
the de:lonstration-talk sort of pattern with a few that were
 
attempts to actually teach some particular subject or style.
 
The .
lost successful of the latter was the shape note worts shop,
 
I believe; this area can be discussed, demonstrated and a couple
 
of hymns taught with full parts in an hour or so, and I recommend
 
it for your consideration.
 In addition to shape note, I have
 
participated in various festivals in sessions on childrens music,
 
guitar teaching techniques, collecting :
methods and use of folk
 
material in elementary and secondary education.
 (
I'm putting
 
these in in case you're wondering what to do with me; I don't
 
have a special passion towards any one of the:.)
 
So far as I know I could be on hand for the
 
entire festival with the proviso that I :
rust be back in Los
 
Angeles on :
Monday July 2
9th in time to catch my breath and teach
 
an evening class.  This would probably mean flying out Sunday
 
night and I do not know the plane schedule.  Which brings up a
 
delicate point; I am perfectly happy to come for transportation,
 
a perdiem and scale, but I would like to have transportation
 
money in advance, _
qs Xktzxxttt the festival comes at t
he dry *oint
 
of the summer.  leachers, as you know, wallow in luxury all fall
 
and spring and sperld their summers in a state of suspended animation
 
waiting for that first fall pay check.
 
Please let a
le know if there i
s anything I can
 
do from here in the line of advance planning or whatever.  Also,
 
send me a schedule of the festival when you have it set.
 I
'll
 
look forward to a
eeting you.  With best regards to all my good
 
friends,
 
S
incerely,

Miss Bess Hawes
 
1628 Palm Court
 
Santa Monica, California
 
Dear Bess:
 
A short while ago we sent a rather bulky mailing
 
outlining the shape of the Newport Folk Festival
 
to meny people we hope to involve in the festival.
 
We did not have your address at the time, or you
 
would have received this mailing.
 We are enclosing a
 
proposal for you and hope you will read it and evaluate
 
the concept in principle and perhaps in detail.
 
The purpose of this letter is
 
participate in this year's fe
 
to assemble a program of wide
 
ambitious program and a multi
 
would contribute immeasurably
 
the first folk festival to be
 
the field of folkmusic itself
 
to invite you to
 
stival.  We are trying
 
scope and interest, an
 
faceted one.  Your talents
 
to the success of this
 
run eolely to benefit
 
All of us are working for union minimum scale in order
 
to achi6ve our aim.
 Naturally travel expenses and a
 
per diem payment will be given to each performer to
 
insure that while no one stands to make any money out
 
of this personally, nobody will lose any either.
 It is
 
a labor of love; there is no question about that.
 But
 
If you feel as we do, we hope you will join with us in
 
this venture.
 
There will be three evening performances during the
 
festival on Friday July 26, Saturday July 27 and
 
Sunday July 28.
 In addition as you will have read
 
in the enclosed material, there will be afternoon
 
workshops covering various facets of folkmusic.
 The
 
Idea is that each performer or group will participate
 
in one of the evening performances and/or a workshop
 
or two;
 the latter to be determined by the performer's
 
preference.
 
Bess Hawes

We would greatly appreciate an early reply from you;
 
in the affirmative, we hope.
 A great deal of advance
 
planning goes into an undertaking of this sort and time
 
is of the essence.
 So please, please let us know within
 
a week at most.
 One thing more:  we would like to have you
 
with us for the entire three days of the festival.
 However,
 
should you be able to be with us only part of the time
 
please let us know about it so that we may plan accordingly.
 
With beat wishes,

Dear Bess:
 
The time is drawing near when travel and other arrange-
ments should be made for your appearance in Newport.
 
We would appreciate your cooperation on the following
 
points:
 
TRAVEL:
 
Car  Artists travelling by road are requested to keep
 
receipts for gas so they may be accurately reimbursed.
 
Such reimbursement will be doubled to cover the return
 
trip.
 
Rail  
â
& Air Travel Reimbursement will be made to cover
 
round trip coach fare either by rail or air from and to
 
,
your point of origin.
 Kindly inform us which way you
 
intend to travel.
 
Since the mode of travel varies from case to case, you
 
are requested to book your own train or air passage.
 
Should you have any difficulties,  however, please
 
feel free to contact us as described below.
 
ATTENTION: 
If your financial situation does not allow you to lay
 
out the necessary funds for travel, please notify us
 
at once.
 The NFF will then supply you with the
 
required funds in the form of transportation tickets
 
or travel vouchers.
 
ACCOMODATIONS:  
All artists are requested to contact us with the
 
following information:
 
1.)
 Day of arrival.
 
2.)
 Day of departure.
 (We are assuming you intend to
 
arrive on Friday and stay through Sunday night,
 
but let us know anyway.)
 
3.)
 How many in your party?
 
4.)
 How many of those are not invited performers?
 
Bess Hawes
 "2-
Upon arrival, each artist or group of artists will be
 
assigned to living accomodations.
 Persons accompanying
 
festival artists will be accomodated also, but at their
 
own expense.
 The Festival will pay for artists accomo-
dations.
 
On each of the three nights there will be a picnic dinner
 
on the festival grounds for artists and staff.
 
With best wishes,
 
The Festival Directors
 
All replies and inquiries regarding the above matters are
 
to be addressed to:

GEORGIA SINGERS 
Bessie Jones and the Georgia Sea Islanders will
 
give a noon concert at Long Beach State College,
 
Monday, May 6, in Lecture Hall 1
51.  The five
 
Negro singers accompany themselves by clapping their hands, stamping
 
their feet, and occasionally playing tambourines.
 
The Islanders, originally from islands having little contact
 
with the mainland of Georgia and the Carolinas, still use an old
 
Negro dialect that dates from before the Civil War.
 Attention was
 
first brought to the island inhabitants by Alan Lomax, and since then
 
Guy Carawan has made tapes of their rituals to preserve their music.
 
(Those who attended the concert and seminar given by Guy Carawan in
 
October at L
.B.S.C. will remember his discussion of the Islanders
 
and some tapes he played of them.)  Recently, Bessie Jones and her
 
group performed at the Ashgrove Concert-Cabaret in Los Angeles.
 
ACTIVITIES 
Gary Hart gives lessons in f
 olksinging and
 
guitar-playing at the Torrance YMCA.
 
Folk dancers meet Tuesday evenings at 7:00 P.M.
 
in the Long Beach State College Women's Gym.
 
The Long Beach Jewish Community Center has regular
 
folk  sessions in which they sing, play, and give lessons on folk
 
instruments.

MAY 4 
In the town of his burial place near Cairo, a holiday
 
is celebrated in commemoration of the "Sultan of
 
Little Faith."
 
This Sultan openly refused to believe in the ascensiC
li of the Prophet
 
Mohammed, claiming it was impossible for any man to get out of bed,
 
go to Jerusalem, ascend to the '
7th sphert. of heaven, and return to
 
Mecca to find his bed still warm.
 â¢
â¢
â¢
 
One day a Saint visited the Sultan and challenged him to a game
 
of chance.
 The Saint won and as forfeit required the Sultan to dive
 
into his garden pool.
 The Sultan did so and was immediately transformed
 
into the wife of a prince.
 As time elapsed, the Sultan-as-princess
 
gave birth to a child, eventually another, and then another.
 Upon
 
the birth of the third child, the Sultan was returnea to his previous
 
state and found himself emerging from his pool dripping wet, face to
 
face with the: waiting Saint.
 When asked if he at last believed,
 
he replied,  "Yes, it's quite obvious now."

WEST
" VALLEY GUITAR GROUP
 
â¢ 
â¢ 
â¢ 
October 10, 1962
 
Ths following f
ew paragraphs are intended to provide a little historical
 
background to the West Valley G-aiï¿½ar Group 4 what it is, when and why it
 
was started, and how it functions at present.  The history is not completed
 
Many people h
ave contributed i
n special ways to make the group what it is
 
today.  H
ere is the abbreviated story.
 
Hav It  Started. The West Valley Guitar Group was started in the fa l
l of
 
1
9
.,
59. A course in folk music and guitar given at San Fernando Valley State
 
College, with Bess Hawes instructing, was the cause of it all.  There were
 
about 3
5 students in attendance.  Several of us decided to do a little
 
extr acurricular activity by getting together once a week to practice the
 
material presented at class.  Three of us Â® J
ane i
ioffstadt, Mac Mackdam,
 
and I met at my home for the first get together.  From this early beginning
 
the group h
as grown to considerable
. proportions, as evidenced by the
 
attached list of names.
 
This current list does not include the names of all who have participated
 
from time to time.  Rather, it is a liet of those who are currently
 
interested enough to show up regularly.  As interests change, as some
 
"go professional", and as people move in and out of the West Valley the
 
list changes.
 
The group is composed largely of those who have attended Bess Hawes'
 
repertory classes and of mutual friends of those in the group.  There
. are
 
no membership dues and no one is obligated to continue as an active
 
participant * Each individual's interests will determine the extent of
 
his participation.
 
Hmw It Functions. We meet once a week, on Friday nite9 at the invitation
 
of the host or hostess in whose home we meet.  This is dome voluntarily,
 
on a more or l
ess notational basis, among the groupo  In this way there is
 
no particular burden on anyone and the "providing.a place to meet" is
 
shared somewhat equally by everybody in the group.
 
R
efreshments (
or not) are served at the discretion of the host or hostess.
 
A 30-cup coffee maker is owned jointly by the group who contributed Blue
 
Chip stamps to obtain it.  I
t is passed around from host to host in time
 
each week for h
im to use it if he so desires Friday rite.
 
I
t has become the custom for the host or hostess to lead off and direct
 
the activities for the evening.  Normally, this follows a pattern somewhat
 
as follows:
 
1
. Singing and playing folk songs as a group effort.
 
2
. Introducing new songs to the groupo
 
3. Perforning singly, as a solo effort, before the rest of the groupo
 
There may be deviations from this general pattern depending on the whims
 
of the host or hostess,  O
ccasionally# special programs are planned.
 
The annual Christmas program is an example of this.
 
Well,thers it is.  I hope that these paragraphs will serge to bring
 
everybody up to date as to hoar it all began and how it functions nowo
 
I hope to see and hear you every Friday rite,

HOLIDAY
,: Nov. 9-10 
On the eve of Martinmass in Lousa, Portugal,
 
"Santa Eebiana" (the name derived from '
bebet,'
 
meaning t
,a s
irink) presides over all wine
 
drinking.
 A procession with torch bearers
 
wends its way through the village, carrying a
 
tippling "Santa Bebiana" aloft in a wheelbarrow.
 
When the procession stops, the impersonator preaches a mock sermon
 
on drunkenness and the followers applaud with a rousing temperance
 
hymn.
 Then the whole village makes good use of the wine harvest.
 
The next day, particularly celebrated in England, a traditional
 
goose is roasted in honor of St. Martin.
 The story goes that the
 
good man panicked at the news of his election as Bishop of Tours and
 
hid in a barn.
 A foolish goose there caused such a racket because
 
of his presence in the hay that the searchers were attracted to his
 
hiding place.
 The unlucky goose was cooked in celebration. By, S
al7,y R
eed.

American Folk Music Council
 
Newsletter No. 1
 
March 15, 1961
 
AFMC BACKGIiOUWD
 
Early in 1960, the Executive Boards of the American Folklore
 
Socie ty, the American Musicological Society and the Socie ty
 
for Ethnomusicolo gy approved in principle a proposal to set
 
up a Joint Organizing Committee to explore the feasibility
 
of establishing an American Folk Music Council.
 
The objectives of this council were to organize the present
 
widespread interest in folk music in the United States with-
in the existing
; societies in order to
 
1) bring to this nucleus of interest, which is comprised in
 
the main by students and graduates of universities and colleges,
 
closer contact with scholarship in the fields of folklore and
 
musicology;
 
2) bring to the support of existing organizations in these
 
fields a wider membership;  and
 
3) avoid impending formation of another separate organization
 
where there are already too many.
 
In addition, it is hoped that the formation of such a council
 
would provide a forum for the exchange of information and
 
opinion between the academic community and the many laymen of
 
specialized knowledge of American folk music.
 
The first meeting of the Joint Organizing Committee appointed
 
by the presidents of the cooperating societies took place in
 
June, 1960, at the University of California, Los Angeles. A
 
list of members of one or more of the societies was agreed upon,
 
these people to be invited to
 
1) form an Advisory Board of 37 members;
 
2) become charter members of the council;  and
 
3) recommend additional members and non-members of the cooper-
ating societies who would be invited to charter membership.
 
Of the 37, three were not heard from. Of the 168 additional
 
persons named by the Advisory Board -- most of them members of
 
one or more of the cooperating societies -- 155 accepted the
 
invitation.
 
On December 30, 1960, after the annual meeting of the American
 
1
,
1usicolo ical Society and the Society for ethnomusicology at
 
the universi
.t7T of California, B^rkeley, the American Folk Music
 
Council was founded.
 Temporary provisions for its governance
 
during 1961 were adopted and a committee to draft a set of by-
laws elected.

including suggestions will be submitted shortly to the
 
presidents of the three cooperating; societies for comment and,
 
it is hoped, approval.  The report will also be circulated
 
among the charter members of the AFMC.
 
The Organizing Committee will remain as a Steering Committee
 
for the year 1961 or until the First General Assembly of the
 
Council, will revise the report, if necessary, to include such
 
comments, amendments and suggestions as may appear to strengthen
 
the Council and will arrange for the holding of a First General
 
Assembly.
 
MINUTES OF THE ORGANIZING MEETING, AMERICAN FOLK MUSIC COUNCIL
 
The meeting
; was called to order December 30,  1960 at the
 
University of California, Berkel ey, at 2:10 pm by Charles
 
Seeger,  acting as chairman.
 
Tempora ry provisions and the Proposed Agenda as annroved by
 
the Advisory Council were adopted by voice vote, i
uith the
 
amendment of the first provisign to. read as follows:
 
"Persons nominated by the Urganizinrr Committee and its Adviso ry
 
Board who are or who become membe,:s, of one or more of the co-
operating societies  shall be Charter 1
1embers of the Council.
 
They shall Day dues not to exceed one dollar for the year 1961
 
and shall vote."
 
A three man committee to draft a set of By-laws for submission
 
to the presidents of the cooperating societies was nominated.
 
Willard Rhodes,  Charles Seeger and John Ward, with David h
lcAllester
 
serving; as alternpte, were named to the committee.
 
Upon a voice vote,  the Orj;anizinï¿½g Committee  (Austin Fife, V
jayland
 
Hand, Sam I
iinton, I
;
Iantle Hood,  Charles Seeger and John Ward) was
 
named to continue as a Steering Committee for the year 1961 or
 
until the First General Assembly of the Council as suggested in
 
the draft proposal submitted to the presidents of the three co-
operating societies.
 
Under the second  item on the agenda, membership drives were con-
sidered.
 Affiliation with local societies or clubs was favored --
with the AFIJC incorporating these local groups without destroying
 
their local autonomy
_.
 Two persons ;resent agreed to serve as
 
meribershi
.n chairmen in their local areas:  I
:
f
irs.  Rosalie Sorrels
 
in Utah and Idaho;  Barry Olivier in the San Francisco Bay Area.
 
Additional local chairmen will be as?.ed to serve b
ar the executive
 
secretary -- the ontire number to constitute a membership
 
committee with the executive secretary serving
; as chairman pro-
tein, the Steering; Committee to  sci,ve as ex officio mer
:ibers.

and acti n; executive secretary proposed the following types of
 
publications:
 
1) a journal;
 
2
,
) a monograph series;
 
3)  a newsletter;
 
4) phonograph records and/or tapes;
 
5) films; and
 
6)  so-called "paper" (plasticized paper) records accompanying
 
printed publications to illustrate musical examples discussed in
 
print.
 
The Steering Committee was requested to appoint a three man
 
committee to investigate costs of publication and to submit a
 
report for publication in a subsequent newsletter.
 
Under item five of the agenda, the Steering Committee was requested
 
to set a date for the First General Assembly.
 
Consideration of incorporation as a non-profit organization was
 
deferred to the Steering Committee. The acting
* executive secretary
 
has contacted a lawyer willing ,
tQ serve as legal counsel without
 
compensation. A report by the legal counsel and subsequent action
 
by the Steering Committee will be available by June 1.
 
Additional items on the agenda were the result of suggestions by
 
the Advisory Comrii.ttee. Mrs. Bess Hawes moved that honorary member-
ships be extended to outstanding informants. The motion was passed
 
unanimously.
 Mrs. Hawes is active as chairman in the formation
 
of a committee to recommend informants for consideration for
 
honorary membership.
 
Two annual awards were proposed:  a Phillips Barry Award for the
 
person presenting the outstanding study in American folk song and
 
an award to the outstanding folk singer or instrumentalist. Con-
sideration of these two awards was postponed for further study.
 
The meeting was adjourned at 3
:15 pm.

FOLK DANCING
, 
Part of the Folklore Institute's policy mentions
 
participation in any activities that seem appropriate
 
for the stimulation of interest in folklore.  Since
 
there is nothing more "
stimulating" than an evening of folk dancing, all
 
members and friends of the Institute are invited to dance with the long-
established, city-sponsored folk dance groups:  Long Beach Folk Dance Co-op
 
at Long Beach City College Women's Gym, Thursdays, 7
:30 until 10:30 and
 
Silverado Park, 31st and Santa Fe, Tuesdays, 7
:30 until 11:00.  Both groups
 
have beginning and advanced teaching each week and a special party night
 
once a month.  Institute members interested in exhibition work are asked to
 
come out to one or both of these groups and make themselves known.
 
MEMBERSHIP 
Did you know that exciting events are being planned
 
for the first of the year which will be open to
 
Folklore Institute: members only?  A "
member" has
 
paid his $1.00 dues and has a membership card to prove it.  Will you be
 
eligible for the Members Only events??  Checks made out to the Long Beach
 
Institute of Folklore and Mythology may be sent to Alice Gabrielson,
 
212 Prospect Ave., Long Beach 3
, California.
 
THANKSGIVING*CHRISTMAS On December 9
 at Point Hope, Alaska, the Eskimos
 
 
 traditionally hold a celebration to appease the
 
souls of animals they have killed so there will be
 
plenty available in the coming year.
 
In a special hall, the community gathers to sing hymns honoring whale souls.
 
A wooden bird hanging from the ceiling flaps its wings against a drum; a top
 
spins, scattering the feathers with which it is decorated; a ceremonial doll
 
bows and nods; the crew in a model whale boat sings and paddles.  Amid all
 
this a
.ctibity the center of attention is divided between several holes in opposite
 
walls of the hall
..  From one hole an ermine will run across the room and
 
escape through a hole in the other-side; if the ermine doesn't enter the proper
 
hole of escape, its behavior is interpreted as an omen: some member of the
 
community will die within the year.  Finally gifts are distributed and
 
the feasting commences.

It was unanimously decided to adopt a tentative structures with
 
temporar.T officers for the proposed Gradua te Folklore Students Asso-
ciation,
, to function for the remainder of the quarter. This aoproach
 
was taken in order to alleviat e the loss  o f momentum and interest
 
which would result from the further delay involved in setting formal
 
election proceedings.  It was emphasized that this is ta
Morary, with
 
the structure and operation open to .
review and revision,  Permanent
 
officers will be elected in Jinus
.ry, and will serve through the
 
summer, with new ores to be elected in the fall
_, It was discussed and
 
decided not to adopt a formal
. constitution. Witt, a loose structure,
 
precedents can be zat, methods
, established, and changes made w

having to follow a pre-es taol!stied pattern or make amendments.

The Folk Studies Society would like to welcome our
 
three new graduate students:
 
Pege Kohn-State University of New York at Albany
 
John Landes-Averitt College, Virginia
 
Steve Moorman-Georgia State University
 
FUTURE ACTIVITIES:
 
The Society is planning a picnic in the near future.
 
Everyone is invited to attend.  Our only delay is the
 
dreary weather Bowling Green has now suffered for over a
 
month.  We will set a date soon and then hope the sun
 
will shine.
 
A reminder:  Dennis Coelho and Dick S
 weterlitsch
 
are scheduled to speak in February; time and place to be
 
announced.
 
AWARDS: 
Mike Morse is the recipient of a statewide photography
 
award given by Associated Press for his work in the local
 
parer, The Park City News. 
Congratulations Mike!
 
Bruce Greene, an undergraduate minor in Folk Studies,
 
is also a recipient of an honors research grant awarded
 
by the Western Kentucky University Honors Committee for
 
his project, "Traditional Fiddle Music of South-Central
 
Kentucky .
"  Keep up the great work Bruce.
 
FOLK INSTRUMENTS:
 
Mike Holmes and Bruce Greene have just completed
 
their 30 minute film entitled, "Folk Instruments."  The
 
comments thus far have given it excellent reviews.  Anyone

interested in viewing the film can call the Educational
 
Television Department on campus and make an appointment
 
to see the film.  Those individuals teaching the phase
 
elective in folklore now have a good classroom tool for
 
use in the "Folk Music"  segment of the course.
 
STATE OF THE BUDGET:
 
The Folk Studies Society has come on hard times--
our expenses somehow exceed our budget.  So, we are
 
now going to have to submit to bureaucracy and begin
 
a dues and subscription rate of $1.00 per semester.  We
 
hope that our undergraduate students will continue to
 
participate and that the subscription rate is not meant
 
to exclude them from our group,  We're  just broke,  so
 
please fill out the form below (for our subscription list)
 
and mail or hand in your dollar and form to our
 
secretary, Ms. Lana Flynn, Van Meter 212.
 
Thanks.

R7VIEW OF FALL, 1973:
 
The Folk Studies Department co-sponsored the recent
 
annual meeting of the American Folklore Society meetings
 
in Nashville, Tennessee.
 Several graduate students from
 
our department participated in the meetings by giving
 
papers in various sessions:
 
Annelen Archbold-The Beeson Farmstead:
 A Black
 
Farmer in Butler County, Kentucky.
 
Peggy Boaz-Folklore and Undergraduate Education
 
at Western Kentucky University.
 
Chip Martin-The Folklore and Beliefs of the
 
American G.I.  in Vietnam.
 
Kathy Martin-Food Preservation and the Folk
 
Aesthetic.
 
Dan Steed-Traditional Auctioneering As A Folk Art.'
 
Don Whitaker-Eyewitness Accounts of the Cheyenne
 
and the Pend d'Oreilles:
 Games and Lifestyles.
 
Phyllis Whitaker-Barroom Jokes:  A Classification
 
and Analysis.  (undergraduate in Folk Studies)
 
As a result of the meetings,  the papers are now
 
being revised for a special edition to be submitted to
 
the Folklore Forum. 
In addition, Wayland Hand asked for
 
several entries from Chip Martin's paper to be included
 
in Dr. Hand's legend collection.
 Kathy Martin was  asked
 
to submit her paper to a special issue of Western Folklore.
 
The general response to all of the papers presented at
 
the meetings has been excellent and that is a good plug
 
for the department.

39pp  $7.95.
 
A biography of Vlad Tepes, Dracula, is now in print.
 
This documented account of the life of Dracula was the
 
result of ten years of research and exploration in libraries,
 
town archives, monasteries, and museums, as well as an
 
6
 
examination of ballads and local legends, mans,  ancient
 
letters, and artwork,  The book traces the history of Vlad
 
Tenes, who ruled Wallachia, Romania during three separate
 
periods  (
1448, 1
456-1462,
 1
476).  It also deals with
 
Dracula's heirs and considers Dracula and other vampires,
 
heroes and tricksters in realistic and literary
 
representation.  Numerous narratives are interspersed
 
throughout Dracula. Most are concerned with the treatment
 
of Dracula's enemies, friends,  and fellow Wallachians.
 
An extensive bibliography, notes, index,  illustrations, and
 
maps complete this well written study.
 
Peggy Bradley Boaz
 
The journal of Ethnohistory began as an anthropological
 
exercise in exploring the history of the American Indian
 
using the tools of ethnology and anthropological theories.
 
As the years passed, these anthropologists began exploring
 
other ethnic groups, while still emphasizing their
 
traditional Indian studies.  An example of these additional
 
efforts is the Winter, 1
972 issue which focuses on the
 
white ethnic community of Kentucky.  Because many of
 
the papers do not utilize the tools and training of the
 
historian and folklorist, many overtly incorrect studies
 
are presented; however, the materials and subject matter
 
are invaluable to the student of folklore.  For those
 
students enrolled in Dr. Ken Clarke's "The Oral Traditions
 
of the North American Indian," Ethnohistory may prove a
 
valuable source in their research.

ARCHIVE:
  
The following summary was prepared by Robert Phillips,
 
Director of the Western Kentucky Folklore Archive.  He,
 
naturally, omitted any reference to himself and did not
 
take credit for the accomplishments he has sL =arized,
 
but without his efforts we would not have the archives
 
which we have.  (Editor's Note)
 
Western Kentucky University is completing the third
 
year of a three-year program for the development of the
 
Western Kentucky University Folklore and Folklife Archive.
 
The archive has developed beyond all expectations in
 
terms of quantity and quality of resources deposited in
 
the archive.
 
During 1
973 the archive acquired the following:
 
Montell Song Collection, George Boswell Song Collection,
 
Gordon Wilson Collection, Campbellsville Barn and Crib
 
Collection, 1
1 2 tapes and cassettes, and 1
95 student
 
field collections.  With the exception of the Gordon
 
Wilson Collection, all materials received have been
 
completely indexed and are ready for research use.
 
The staff has worked diligently to develop all
 
resources into a workable research archives.  The staff
 
devoted to archival work has increased during 1
973 to
 
one full time secretary, two graduate assistants, and
 
two student assistants.  This is equivalent to three
 
full time persons devoted to archival works  Both graduate
 
assistants are receiving their M.A. in Folk Studies from
 
Western Kentucky University.
 
The library purchased the Legacy book display seen
 
recently at the A.F.S. meeting in Nashville, Tennessee.
 
Also, all major reference works used in folklore have
 
been ordered and should be ready for use by Spring of
 
1
973.  These reference works are duplicates of the
 
general reference area, however, these will be shelved
 
on the eighth floor of the Cravens Graduate Center.  The
 
objective is to have a complete research center for
 
folk studies in one location of the Cravens Graduate
 
Center.
 
The year 1
974 should exceed 1
973 in terms of acquisition
 
of archival materials.  Already we have received two
 
major collections, one of which will definitely result
 
in a major publication s There will be three publications
 
appearing in April, 1
974, which will assist all users
 
of the archives.  The three publications will cover
 
archiving procedures, subject heading assigned to resources,
 
and a users'  annroach to retrieval of archival resources.
 
8
 
All efforts have been designed to make the archive
 
a comfortable and rewarding place to gain information
 
for your nrogram at WKU,
 If anyone has suggestions,
 
which will improve the archive, please let them be
 
known.

GRADUATE COLLOOUIU14
 
The first of this season's Graduate Colloquiu:.S is beginning to
 
shape up.
 All that's needed is a place at which to have it.
 
The mysterious Jose Limon, who was sighted last week in the Folklore
 
Center for the first time this year, will be talking on t
'
_ze subject of
 
"Agringado Joking in Texas-^4exican Culture."  Also slated to perform is John
 
H. McDowell who has entitled his presentation "The Riddle of Riddles, the
 
Tale of Tales, and other Minor Enigmas" -- we all know what that will be about,
 
don't we?
 
These meetings are an attempt to give graduates a chance to find
 
out what their fellow students are working on as well as a possible time to
 
hear professors from other fields present material that has some connection
 
with folklore (and what doesn't?).
 
Richard Santos, a professor of history at Our Lady of the Lake in
 
San Antonio, will speak on "The Influence of Jewish Folklore on Hexican
 
Customs".

ACADEMIC INTERESTS AND WORK IN PROGRESS
 
Roger Abrahams is teaching at Indiana during the first summer session,
 
probably a "Performer in Culture" class and an introductory course.  He'll
 
spend July back in Austin, honing down those key concepts in his 341 course.
 
Tom Green will take on  a teac
hi ng  job in the English Department at
 
the University of Delaware this fall.
 
Joanne Krauss and her husband Bob Nowicki are presently in
 
Bloomington,  %
,here Bob has an appointment in the German department.  Around
 
the middle of February, Joanne moved to Aiami, Florida, to begin dissertation
 
research.
 She proposes to do an ethnographic and folkloristic study of
 
retired people.  She plans to visit Austin some time in (
larch, and if Bob
 
gets a grant to study in Germany this summer, Joanne may again rejoin our
 
singing and dancing throng.  Joanne recently acquired a car, and we hope that
 
this auto, unlike The Green Pepper and its various reincarnations, will not
 
contribute to her elbow fund.
 
Ginger Farrer is doing fieldi:
=ork at the Mescalero Apache Indian
 
Reservation.  Analysis of the data will enable her to work on curriculum

reports that she is learning the language -- grammar and 'folk speech',
 
social customs such as pow wow attendance, and is conducting a workshop on
 
intercultural education.  She welcomes visitors and letters.
 
Beverly Stoelt,e: ritual, play and symbolism.  Specific current
 
topics of interest include Phenomenology, Hegel, Bothy Ballads in Northeast
 
Scotland, applied folklore in everyday interactions, and children's folklore.
 
This summer she will be carrying out research in West Texas for her disser-
tation on the topic of rodeo as a form of ritual-play within the general
 
context of West Texas  Culture:.
 
John McDowell: creative application of tradition to circumstance,
 
e
.g., Latin American folklore including that of Chicanos, Anglo American
 
middle class culture, children's folklore, and certain nocturnal trepida-
tions of obscure fifteenth century Provencal peasants.  Also, the sociology
 
of voyeurism, the riddle of riddles, and the left-handed methods of playing
 
the Flemish concertina.  His paper, "Interrogative Routines in the Folklore
 
of Mexican-American Children," has recently been published as a Texas
 
Working Paper in Sociolinguistics, no. 20.

Melvin Wade: narrative analysis; proposed dissertation research is
 
an ethnography of communication among Blacks in East Texas; currently
 
working on a history of scholarship in Black American folkl
.ore.
 
Mar? Hardesty: political folklore; the manipulative use of folklore;
 
and the use of symbols in mainland China before, during and/or after the
 
Revolution.
 
Meg Brady: children's folklore.  Meg is learning to speak Navaho and
 
plans to visit the Arizona Navaho reservation this summer to study the
 
expressive play repertoires of children.  Her paper "
'This Little Lady's
 
Gonna Boogaloo' -- Elements of Socialization in the Play of Black Girls,"
 
based on her M.A. thesis, will soon be published by the Southwest Educational
 
Development Laboratory, Austin.
 
A
like Licht: drawing upon ethnographies, literary treatments, and
 
travelers' accounts in studying praise singing among the Hausa and other West
 
African peoples.  Also, Mike plans to use formal elicitation procedures to
 
investigate whether Austin high school students distinguish among types of
 
social identity on the basis of modes of expressive culture.  His paper,
 
"Some Automotive Play Activities of Suburban Teenagers," was published in
 
New York Folklore Quarterly 30,1 (
Marc h 1974), 44-65 . 
Shifra Epstein: planning a trip to New York City to work with Barbara
 
Kirshenblatt-Gimblett on an ethnography of a Purim celebration.
 Shifra is
 
the local representative of the American Jewish Committee Oral History Project,
 
which is studying the adjustment of Holocaust Survivors to pluralistic American
 
society.  She is also involved in plai -,
ring the southern regional meeting of
 
Israeli Students and Professors in America, to be held in Austin, March 8-11.
 
Nick Spitzer: folklore and popular culture; country-western and
 
suburban music; blues and jazz; performance and musical styles as reflective
 
of cultural change; radio ethnography.  Attended Mardi Gras celebrations in
 
Basile and Mamou, Louisiana.  Also interested in studying Black Cajun musicians
 
and festival behavior.
 
Ed Miller: twentieth century Britain, particularly Scotland, Northern
 
Ireland, and Northern England.  Genres of interest are folksong, monologue,
 
humor, dialect use and other such types of verbal performance, approached not
 
merely as texts but as forms of expressive art which have varying relations
 
to the social environment from which their performers come.
 In particular,
 
he is interested in the ways that traditional forms of expressive art, such
 
as folksong and monologue, are used, preserved, altered, and perceived in the
 
British '
folk revival.'  Topics of interest include life experience trans-
figuration in British dialect monologues, recent songs concerning the changing
 
environment of Glasgow, the acquisition of repertoire by a Northern Irish
 
singer, British regional Music Hall styles and their relationship to folk
 
performances, and repertoires of British soccer supporters.  Ed adds that he
 
desperately wants to spend three months in Scotland, talking to singers,
 
attending folk clubs and festivals, buying clothes, and drinking McEwans
 
Export.  Please send contributions to the E. M

DanieZZe Roemer:  dissertation research on folklore forms and perfor-
mance patterns among Anglo children, ages five through eight years.
 Particular
 
emphasis on describing children's 'rules'  -for interaction and creativity in
 
folklore performance.  Other interests include the use of Anglo cultural
 
symbols in nineteenth century black face minstrelsy, and the importance of
 
speaking in Black culture and its relation to the content and structure of
 
novels by Zora Neale Hurston (
particularly Their Eyes Were Watching God, and
 
A
JVZes and Men).  Tentative plans for the 1975-76 school year include inves-
tigating the folklore of Black school girls, working on a bibliographic essay
 
on scholarship dealing with women's folklore, and, God willing and the creek
 
don't rise, finding a job.

Alan Govenar: tattooing as ritual and expressive art; ethno-
medicine; narrative analysis.
 
Joyce Coleman: medieval European Culture
. and literature, especially
 
Anglo-Saxon; medieval legends, particularly tracing their passage across
 
time and from culture to culture (with past work done on Virgil The Magician,
 
The Flying Dutchman, The Hope of Britain theme); folklore in the medieval
 
chronicles; Norse and Celtic mythology; the Arthurian cycle; science fiction,
 
detective, and Gothic writing as twentieth century heroic romance; the
 
personal use of myth, including literary creations of myth; and the cognitive
 
differences involved in speaking different languages.  Also a lot of other
 
stuff that has even less to do with folklore.
 
Josh Limon: working on his dissertation, tentatively entitled
 
"The Expressive Behavior of Texas Chicano Youth," based on data he collected
 
at UT.  Will read a paper on "Agringado Joking in Texas-Mexican Culture" at
 
a UCLA Anthropology Department Colloquium on March 31.
 
Ruth Miller: working on folklore in religious expression, especially
 
among certain Anglo American sects founded and led by women (
the Shakers,
 
Universal Friends, Southcottians, as well as more contemporary groups of
 
a millenarian or enthusiastic nature).
 Interests include children's folklore;
 
popular culture; and material culture (
e.g., designs used in pottery, weaving,
 
etc., and the processes by which these are learned).
 
Tom Ireland: is busy being an overworked English Department T.A. and
 
taking three courses in his spare time.  This semester he is dividing his
 
course work between the Louisiana Cajuns (his  'folk')  and developing skills
 
in teaching and course design, with an eye toward employment in junior colleges
 
and satellite universities.  Possibly next fall, comprehensive exams and then
 
-- "laissez les Bon Temps roulez."
 (Actually what Tom says he would really
 
like to do is to quit school after this semester and become a shuttle bus
 
driver.)
 
Susan KaZcik: ethnicity, ethnic American folklore, and women's lore.
 
Dissertation research among Polish Americans in San Antonio; possible emphases
 
include folklore as it relates to the revival of ethnic identity, and the
 
manipulation of folklore elements in the creating of group identity.
 In
 
June she will begin coordinating fieldwork for the Old World Ways in the New
 
World Program of the Folklife Festival.
 
Becky LasZey: applied folklore; application of stereotyping theories
 
to reality; using folklore concepts in classroom and museum teaching; the
 
problems of methodology in the analysis of material culture; personal cogni-
tive response and traditional community response to religious and psychic
 
experiences.
 
Mary-Evelyn (Dianita) Porter: t
he choreography of the possession
 
trance dances of Condomble

cially music, ritual, dance, and drama.  Other interests include quilting,
 
ethnic studies, Black folk music.  Lorre is currently working with tape
 
recordings of the folk singer Mary Bird McAllister.

DEEP DOWN IN THE ARCHIVES
 
The department archivist reports that the archiving of undergraduate
 
papers is nearing completion.  The papers are filed alphabetically and
 
classified firstly by subject area (
e.g., Mexican, Texas, children, music,
 
etc.) and secondly by type (
e.g., myth, narrative, lore of specific groups,
 
graffitti, etc.).  Don't get too excited, however -- about 900- of the papers
 
are disappointingly shallow and can only occasionally contribute any data
 
useful for folklore research on such exciting topics as "My Elephant
 
Figurine Collection" and "Alpha Delta Phi Sorority songs."  Nevertheless,
 
the honourable Richard Dorson consulted these files and quoted some of the
 
papers in his America in Legend.
 Sc maybe there are a few grains of gold
 
dust waiting to be panned from the river of papers that flows into the
 
drawers.  One nugget to be recommended is a paper on Texas Fiddlers by
 
Bernard Mollbert.
 
The record collection is, to say the least, inadequate, unless you're
 
into Ewan MacColl (
an exercise in aural masochism).  However some good recent
 
additions include several Folkways recordings of cult music and drum rhythm
 
from Africa and the Caribbean; a number of Library of Congress records of
 
North American Indian Music; and Chris Strachwitz's first effort at recording
 
Texas/Mexican Norteno music.
 
If these don't satisfy your musical tastes, then make friends with
 
Nick Spitzer (
blues, country, country/blues, progressive and regressive
 
country and western) or Dave Stanley (
jug band, 50's and 60's folk,
 
Commander Cody, etc. etc.) .

U.T. WOMEN IN ANTHROPOLOGY
 
WIA is organized for graduate women in the Department of Anthropology.
 
We feel that in the process of developing professional careers it is neces-
sary for us to be aware of our changing social roles and in particular it is
 
necessary that we be aware of potential conflict between traditional woman's
 
roles and the emerging role of women as professional.
 
Our immediate goals are to render mutual support to each other and
 
to incoming students, and to sponsor programs of interest to ourselves and
 
the community of graduate anthropology students.
 
In accomplishing these aims we intend to:
 
7
 
1
.  Develop a program for contacting new female students and helping them
 
get settled in Austin.
 
2
.  Develop educational programs for learning about various aspects of
 
women's changing roles.
 
3.  Develop ways of keeping up with research in women's studies.
 
4
.  Sponsor programs and social events of interest to the membership.
 
Currently we are sponsoring an informal discussion on Assertiveness
 
Training for Women.  Assertiveness Training is a program that was developed by
 
businessmen to teach executives how to present a professional self-image.
 This
 
program has now been adopted for women to teach them to 'undo' traditional
 
feminine behavior patterns which handicap them in professional interactions.
 If
 
enough members of our group are interested, we will go through the training
 
program as a group.

FIELDWORK AND INTERVIEWING
 
The Austin Public Library maintains a card file of people who have ex-
pressed an interest in being interviewed.  Many of these people had a major role
 
in shaping both local and state politics in past years; others are long-time
 
businessmen in and around Austin.  Additionally, there are just plain folks who
 
would be happy to talk into your tape recorder.
 
The Library will furnish tapes, which remain the property of the Library.
 
The Folklore Center has recorders which you may borrow (
contact Ms. Frances
 
Terry).  You may use any data collected for class projects; however, any publica-
tion of material will have to be negotiated between you and your informant.
 
If you need an informant or are interested in the folklore of politics or
 
business, contact Ms. Audrey Bateman at 472-5433.
 Tell her you are a graduate
 
student in folklore and that you learned of the project through this Newsletter.

FOLKLORE SPOR:S OF VARIOUS DENOMINATIONS
 
On the Sports Score, the sin cebolla kid reports that there's definitely
 
a guacamole orientation in the department.  Volleyball is a distinct possibility
 
as a group activity -- all that's lacking just now is more people, a ball, a net,
 
and money to buy the latter two necessities.
 Soccer-wise, the hot news is that
 
Cosmos queen B. J. Stoeltje has handed over her captaincy to another team member
 
as she has decided it's impossible to run a soccer team, a family, and an aca-
demic career all at one time.  Armadillo old-stagers, E. M. and J. McD. are
 
suffering the rare experience of not being first in the Men's Soccer League, but
 
both have vowed to put their team on top again by Easter -- how else can you
 
maintain a reputation of being a legend-in-your-own-time?

Roger Renwick has so far declined to show his prowess on the soccer field.
 
It is rumored that he doubts if he'd F
-4.
t into the system that is a team.  He is
 
anxious, however, to contact twenty-one other players and two umpires to play
 
cricket as soon as a suitable wicket can be found.
 
Other sports in the department should leave a note of their telephone
 
numbers in John McDowell's mail box.
 
CHILDREN'S FOLKLORE RESEARCH TEAM
 
Richard Bauman, on a one year's leave from the University, is currently
 
heading a research project on children's folklore.  The project, funded by the
 
National Institute of Education, is part of a more comprehensive research and
 
development project in Children's Folklore undertaken by the Southwest Educa-
tional Development Laboratory, Austin.  The population consists of five through
 
eight year old Chicano, Anglo, and Black children.  The study's first phase,
 
which has just been completed, involved collecting items in the genres of
 
counting outs, jump rope, handclaps, interactional routines (
e.g., riddles, knock
 
knocks, catches) as well as narratives and entertainment rhymes and songs.  The
 
team arranged the data of each child by genre and maintained transcripts so that
 
social use of the items can be studied.  Analysis will include describing chil-
dren's developmental acquisition of sociolinguistic competencies.  Later compar-
ative work will study the relationship of genre, age, sex, and ethnicity to chil-
dren's manipulation of the items in their repertoires.  Members of the research
 
team are Richard Bauman, John McDowell, Dorothy Stroman, Andy Meditch, Meg Brady,
 
and Danielle Roemer.
 
COMING ATTRACTIONS ON THE JOB MARKET
 
Recently there has been a significant increase in the number of folklore
 
jobs in the public sector.
 In the past, jobs could be found with museums and
 
state and local societies.  For decades the only agency in the federal government
 
officially concerned with folklore has been the Archive of Folksong in the Library
 
of Congress, but their funding is small and provides little, if any, stimulus
 
for jobs.
 
The Smithsonian's participation in the Bicentennial is the first step in
 
changing that bleak picture.  Not only has the Smithsonian increased its staff
 
of trained folklorists (
Susan Kalcik is among its new members), but its interest
 
has established a climate in which government personnel and politicians know what
 
folklore is and can be approached.
 
Following the establishment of National Endowments for the Arts, and for
 
the Humanities, State Arts Councils were formed.
 So far only two state councils
 
have hired folklorists, and Tennessee is currently looking for a Folklore Program
 
Coordinator.
 
Another hope for jobs rests with passage of the Folk-life Bill.
 In the
 
last session of Congress, it had a good deal of support, but for a variety of
 
reasons, some political and others mechanical, the bill again failed to pass.  It
 
has been reintroduced and when passed, will establish the American Folklife
 
Center in the Library of Congress.  The Center's staff and responsibilities will
 
be larger and more encompassing than those of the Folksong Archive.  Once
 
9
 
functioning, it will employ trained folklorists and will be able to sponsor
 
fieldwork projects.
 
Another possibility for job hunters is to investigate positions in depart-
ments other than English and Anthropology.  Education departments are showing more
 
interest in folklorists, and a folklorist was recently hired to teach at the med-
ical school at Pennsylvania State University.
 
The job market will be better, and there are possibilities for actually
 
getting good.
 This won't happen immediately, but soon enough to make it worth-
while hanging in there.
 
RECORD RAMBLINGS,,
 
or,  "HALF-WAY BETWEEN LUST AND ARCHIVING"
 
by Ed Miller
 
Ed recommends that for the best of Irish music, one should have a listen
 
to any record by Planxty, the Chieftains, Na Fili, Al O'Donnell  (LER 2073), or
 
any of the Outlet series of All-Ireland Champions on whistle, accordion, fiddle
 
or flute.
 
For Scottish music, the pick of the revivalist bunch might be The Boys of
 
the Lough (
LER 2090 & 2086), Dick Gaughan, Isla St. Clair  (TGA 112), and The
 
Clutha (
12TS242).
 
And for a good sampling of English music and song, try Dave Burland (LER
 
2082 & 2029), Mike Harding  (LER 2039), Nic Jones (LER 2027 & 2014), and anything
 
by The High Level Ranters.
 
Anyone wishing to buy records of all kinds of British, and American folk
 
music can now do so from the following mail order discount company: Free Reed
 
Records, RD1, Wormer Road, Voorheesville, N.Y. 12186.

RECORD REVIEW
 
J'EmAIS AU BAL-MUSIC FROM FRENCH LOUISIANA  (
I Wert to the Dance)
 
by Nick Spitzer
 
Swallow LP 6020
 
The
 
Acadian, or
 
seventeenth
 
the eclipse
 
title of this excellent anthology LP is aptly chosen since the French
 
Cajun, music of Southwest Louisiana finds its antecedents in the
 
century French dance hall.
 Even in the post-World War II era with
 
of Fais-do-do's  (
house parties; literal meaning:  'go to sleep')  and
 
10
 
the rise of the honky-tonks, Cajun music is still dance music above all.
 The
 
stylistic influences of Country and Western, Blues and Rock, are evidence of new
 
and vital flavorings in the musical gumbo.
 
This album is the product of one and a half years of research, within a fifty
 
mile radius of Lafayette, by folklorists Ron and Fay Stanford.
 The work was
 
funded by a Youthgrant from the National Endowment for the Humanities and
 
provides perhaps the best sampling available of the music on one LP.
 (Other good
 
ones are: Arhoolie 5009, 5015, 5004, 5008; Old-limey 108, 109, 110, 111, 114;
 
Swallow 6001, 6
`
.003, 6009; La Louisianne 130; and two Sonnet LP's released in
 
Europe, The Cajuns, vols. I and II.)
 
Included are a number of traditional two-steps and waltzes such as:
 
J'Etais au BaZ Hier au Soir; La Valse des Meches; Bosco Stomp; La Robe d ParasoZ;
 
Cypress Inn SpeciaZ; and Madeline..
 
Also anthologized is Clifton Chenier's Toes Zes Temps en Temps, which
 
represents city Zydeco music  (
Cajun, Blues, and R & B on electric guitars and
 
piano accordion)  in an old Arhoolie studio recording, while Delton Broussard and
 
the Lawtell Playboys do Made
.Zine in a more rurally oriented style (acoustic
 
instruments, fiddle, and button accordion)  that is closer to white tradition.
 
Regionally popular stars like Clint West and Vin Bruce are also present.
 
West, in particular, has gone through a number of metamorphoses since his days as
 
a "Boogie King" in the 50's and early 60's.  His offering of Sweet Susannah shows
 
strong Country and Western influences and is a beautiful bilingual tearjerker
 
to boot.
 
Dewey Balfa of Basile, leader of the Ba la Freres, aided in collecting much
 
of the music.  His band with accordianist Nathan Abshire is heard on the title
 
track and on Casses pas ma T65te.
 
Also of note is a lone ballad from Mrs. Agnes Bourque, a seventy-seven year
 
old widow from Eunice.
 A major find of the Stanford's stay, she provides a
 
haunting song called La Veuve de Sept Ans  (The Seven Years Widow).  Ballads,
 
unlike traditional dance music, are nearly nonexistent among young Cajuns, and
 
Mrs. Bourque is one of extremely few ballad singers from her own generation.
 The
 
seven years probably refers to the Napoleonic conscription period; the rest of
 
the song's content is localized in time and geographic area to the U.S. Civil War.
 
The recordings are all of good quality and come from Cajun country living
 
rooms, dance halls, and recording studios.
 They represent the full spectrum of
 
Cajun music today; white/black, country/city, and traditional/commercial.
 The
 
lyric sheet,was-done by a bilingual community member (Dewey Balfa).  While not
 
phonetically perfect, it contains as good idiomatic translations as can be
 
expected.
 The Stanfords provide a booklet with descriptions and photographs that
 
are both entertaining and informative.
 
TRAINING PROGRAM FOR COLLEGE ENGLISH TEACHERS
 
by Tom Ireland
 
The English Department and the English Education Center (SUT 236)  are putting
 
the final touches on a program designed to train M.A.s and Ph.D.s to teach English
 
at community colleges in Texas.
 The program has been designed to
 
E
 
11
 
meet the specific needs of these colleges -- needs defined  through a series of
 
meetings held over the last two years with representatives of the various schools.
 
Familiarly referred to as the "M.A.--plus-3C  (
hours]" program, it is open
 
only to those who have a M.A. or Ph.D. and who want to learn how to teach English
 
at the college level.  The program does not award a degre6, but does provide
 
training that improves the student's expertise at teaching English -- making the
 
student better qualified than most to teach in a community college.
 
According to the program proposal, all students will be required to take
 
English 381L (
Teaching College English)  first, followed by or taken concurrently
 
with English 383L (
English Language, Literature, and Composition).  In addition
 
to these two core courses, "inserviee" students (
i.e., those already teaching in
 
a community college) will be required to teach a demonstration class and/or serve
 
as resource persons for the preservice students in the program.  Preservice
 
students (
those not yet teaching in a community college) will also be required to
 
serve a one-semester internship in a cooperating community college, for which they
 
will receive credit in EdC 697P (
Graduate Internship).
 
The student has considerable latitude ,
in choosing the courses needed to
 
fill out the remainder of the 30-hour requirement.  There are various criteria
 
established by the program which divide possible courses into five areas of
 
concern:  (
1)  linguistics and communication,  (
2) literature,  (
3) rhetoric and
 
criticism,  (
4) writing and composition, and (
5)  teaching and related problems.
 
Depending on your brand of folklore, you might want to concentrate on any one
 
of these.
 
The program has been informally approved by most of the principal people
 
involved and has now almost completed the formal process of approval by the
 
University.  Interested people should contact the English Education Center
 
(
471-3907) or Tom Ireland (at the Folklore Center)  for more details.
 
FOLKLORE IN FRESHMAN COMP:
 
WRITING ABOUT TALKING AND BELIEVING
 
BY Joe Graham
 
Folklore provides an excellent means of getting students out of the read-
discuss-analyze-write syndrom of many English classes.  I have used folklore in
 
Freshman Comp classes at Sul Ross State and at other colleges.  One of the bene-
fits is that students are using a literature familiar to them.  After deciding
 
on a topic such as the Three Nephites, the Hook or French Fried Rat legends, I
 
ask students to collect these narratives from informants and we discuss the
 
techniques of the interview.
 
The assignments usually go through the following stages: 1
) introducing
 
the topic; 2
) making the assignment for the interviews which, when written up,
 
constitute an outside paper to be turned in; 3
) having the students read the
 
papers aloud in class; 4
) discussing the legends collected; 5
) writing an in-
class assignment on some aspect of the narratives; 6
) discussing the implications
 
of believing or not believing the stories; and 7
) examining ethnic stereotypes.
 
Before one introduces the topic, he must know something about local lore
 
-- I find that local legends are the most fruitful.  One of the most widely
 
12
 
talked about subjects at Sul Ross is a mysterious light near Marfa, Texas.  The
 
next step is to introduce it to the class, and if the legend cycle is well known,
 
plenty of response will be forthcoming.  After a short discussion, I normally
 
introduce the next assignment as an interview to be conducted, and give a hand-
out which provides the students with the complete format which I expect them to
 
use, including the questions for which they are expected to get answers.  Then
 
we discuss the techniques of the interview, and sometimes I play a sample tape
 
from my own fieldwork.
 
The following period we discuss the stories and their implications.  This
 
is an excellent opportunity to demonstrate the use of the various rhetorical
 
strategies (
comparison and contrast, classification and division, etc.).
 
Also it is apparent to the students by this time t
'
,
'-.
,at there is something
 
peculiar about the tales -- the repeated motifs, and the unusual but identical
 
experiences reported by different individuals.  It is easy to make the point
 
that critical evaluation can help one avoid accepting stories just because they
 
seem believable.  This applies to what we read as well, and articles and stories
 
appearing in newspapers and magazines can be useful in demonstrating this.
 
We then examine where uncritical evaluation can lead in interpersonal
 
relationships.  Ethnic jokes are well known, and after eliciting a few of these
 
from the class, we discuss stereotyping.  After a general discussion, I have
 
students give the Mexican American stereotype of the Anglo and the Anglo
 
stereotype of the Mexican American.  There is a remarkable similarity between
 
the stereotypes, and the cultural differences which appear are usually couched
 
in pejorative terms.
 
It should be noticed that I have purposefully chosen to begin with
 
legends to which no one has any great emotional cor mitment -- it is easier to
 
look at them objectively.
 
This project has been successful for me, and is interesting for the
 
students.
 Invariably, I get the best student papers of the year from these
 
written assignments, not to mention the best class participation.

Freshman Comp should read the following two articles from CoZZege EngZi

The Folklore Students Association of Indiana University is pleased to announce
 
the establishment of the PREPRINT SERIES, an exciting new concept in f
olklore
 
Folklore is an expanding and highly innovative field which requires the rapid
 
dissemination of important ideas
 
scholars.  Yet we are all aware of the lapse of time between the acceptance of
 
an article and its publication.  We have established the PREPRINT SERIES as a
 
service for folklorists to insure that n
ew 
.
-as reach a wide audience
 
rapidly
possible.
 
We will publish articles, notes, bibliographies, d
issertations, and other
 
significant works submitted to and accepted by the Publications Committee of the
 
Folklore Students Association.  Several times during the y
ear we will send to
 
our subscribers a list of our publications which they may purchase for a modest
 
price based upon our c
ost of publication.  Each contributor receives ten free
 
copies of his work and retains the right to publish his article in a journal or
 
other publication of his choosing s
o that there is no c
onflict of c
opyright.
 
When one of our articles is published in a j
ournal or other publication, v
ie will
 
withdraw it from our 
list.
 
Our subscription rate is $1.00/year.  Make checks payable to Folklore Students
 
Association.  Address all inquiries, contributions and subscriptions t

Kentucky Folklore Society Meeting
 
On Saturday, November 23, 1974, there will be a meeting
 
of the Kentucky Folklore Society at Gordon Wilson Hall, Western
 
Kentucky University.  The general purpose of the meeting, which
 
is jointly sponsored by the K.F.S. and the Center for Intercul-
tural Studies, is to increase interest and participation in the
 
Society.
 Lectures by Dr. Kenneth Clarke and Dr. William Jansen
 
will provide a perspective on the discipline of folklore.  The
 
program will also encourage the use of folklore materials in
 
various areas of the public school curricula.  Workshops and
 
discussions will focus on media aids (recordings and films)
 
and will explore techniques to stimulate appreciation of our
 
culture and heritage.

Editor's Note
  
Although the primary function of this newsletter is the
 
dissemination of news to its readers, the Editor feels that at
 
least two other sections are worthy of inclusion in this pub-
lication.
 
9eginning with this issue, there will be a section entitled,
 
"Notesand Queries," the function of which will be to provide
 
an opportunity for the readers to exchange information with one
 
another.
 
Secondly, a book and record review section has been re-
instated in order that readers might keep abreast of the current
 
works in the field of folklore and other related disciplines.
 
If anyone comes across a recently published work t"tat you think
 
might be of interest to others, you are invited to submit a
 
review to the Editor.
 The reviews should be critical in nature,
 
(not just summaries) and should not exceed 200 words in length.
 
Faculty 
Dr. Lynwood Montell attended a conference of the Kentucky
 
Council for the Social Studies in Lexington, Kentucky on October
 
26th.
 Dr. Montell was a participant on a panel dealing with the

Comment and Criticism
  
Kenneth L.  Ketner.
 "The Role of Hypotheses in Folkloristics,"
 
Journal of American Folklore, Vol. 86 (
1973)9 pp. 114-30.
 
Ketner explicitly states that there can be no science of
 
folklore without the utilization of hypotheses for folkloristic
 
studies.
 He downgrades two specific types of inquiry used by
 
folklorists:
 1) data collection followed by hypothesis formu-
lation (inductive approach), 2) data collection with no specific
 
problem or purpose (that is, inquiry merely for the sake of
 
collecting).
 According to Ketner, true scientific inquiry
 
employs an hypothesis, a statement asserting a uniform connection
 
between phenomena, as a guideline for data collection.
 
Valid scientific inquiry begins with a puzzling question
 
concerning a specific relationship between items.
 One or more
 
hypotheses are then developed as an answer, which are testable.
 
Being testable essentially means that there need to be deduced
 
observable consequences derived from the relationship stated in
 
the hypothesis.
 These observable consequences are the basic
 
source of data collection.
 
Any hypothesis abstracts from reality in virtually the same
 
manner as does a detailed map of a geographic area.
 In both
 
cases, there can never be a perfect representation of reality.
 
But such abstractions can present the folklorists with a simple,
 
less cumbersome means of dealing with the real world.
 It is
 
then up to the researcher to logically determine whether or not
 
a particular hypothesis is both valid and useful.
 
The main advantage of using hypotheses for inquiry is that,
 
in effect, the folklorist is dealing with the interactions and
 
relationships of two or more distinct items.
 In contrast, folk-
lorists in general employ the materialistic approach--studying
 
one specific object or item without regard to its possible
 
interactions with other phenomena.
 While this has traditionally
 
been a most popular approach, especially for diffusionists
 
and separatists, Ketner suggests that the recent uprising of
 
scientific folkloristics will pave the way for new channels of
 
knowledge within the discipline.
 
It is important to note, however, that hypothesis formu-
lation is merely another method of inquiry.
 Not all hypotheses
 
are empirically testable.
 Others, while being testable, may
 
not be applicable to all geographical areas or may not hold true
 
over time.
 Therefore, there is a need for constant refining and
 
revising of accepted theory derived from scientific f
 olkloristics.

Notes and Queries
  
Recordings of folk music are generally difficult to locate
 
because most stores have little or no folk music available.
 If
 
they do carry any folk music, it is usually the Clancy Brothers
 
variety of commercialized recording.
 Even bluegrass recordings
 
are hard to find (in Pennsylvania, at least).
 Consequently,
 
for the past several years I have been dealing with some record
 
distributors which have large catalogs of traditional music
 
recordings and tend to have cheaper prices than either stores or
 
direct-from-company orders.
 I recommend any of the following
 
distributors for people who need to buy records, either for
 
personal use or for classroom purposes.
 
Roundhouse Records (formerly Rounder Records), P
.O. Box 474,
 
Somerville, MA 02144.  Extensive catalog of country and
 
blues.
 Good service and prices.
 
Dean Wallace, P
.O. Box 473, Noank, CT 0
6340.  New distributor.
 
Handles English and Irish imports.
 
Thomas H. Stern, P.O. Box 1228, White Plains, NY 10602.
 Un-
usual recordings of European music.
 Some imports which
 
are not available from Wallace.
 
There is a partial list of records available through
 
Wallace in the Folk Studies office.
 I would be happy to lend
 
anyone my Roundhouse catalogs or the Sterns listing.

I am doing research on flood tales of the North American
 
Indians.
 My particular interest is a universal flood;
 that
 
is, a flood that covers the entire earth.
 Any information
 
concerning these Indian accounts will be greatly appreciated.

Examples of oral narratives in our generation are hitch-
hiking stories.
 Everyone I know who hitchhikes has at least
 
one such narrative.
 I am interested in collecting these hitch-
hiking stories, and if you have any stories from your own
 
experiences or from the experiences of friends, please contact
 
me.

In 1966, the U. S
. Post Office initiated the "American
 
Folklore Series" with a stamp depicting Johnny Appleseed.
 The
 
1967 issue was Davy Crockett, and in 1968, Daniel Boone appeared.
 
For 1972, the Post Office issued a stamp showing Tom Sawyer
 
whitewashing a fence.
 The 1973 theme was the headless horseman
 
from Washinton Irving's "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow."

Folklore Society Meetings
  
On November 23rd, the Kentucky Folklore Society met
 
at Gordon Wilson Hall, here at Western.
 Highlights of the
 
meeting included talks by Dr. Kenneth Clarke and Dr. William
 
Jansen and film and folk instrument workshops, presented by
 
graduate students in the folk studies program.
 I
v
is. Camilla
 
Collins is to be congratulated for her efforts in organizing
 
the program and helping to make it a success.  The program
 
was well attended by folklorists from both Kentucky and
 
Tennessee.
 
Also, on Saturday, November 9th, several of the grad-
uate students attended the annual meeting of the Tennessee
 
Fol klore Society at Carson-Newman College, Jefferson City,
 
Tennessee.
 Talks by Thomas G. Burton, Saundra Ivey, Richard
 
Blaustein, James R. Reese, Charles K. Wolfe, and others
 
helped make the meeting a worthwhile event.
 Our thanks also
 
go out to Dr. Ralph Hyde for the many courtesies he extended
 
to the students who attended the meeting.
 
Faculty
  
The Hewers and the Carvers, an illustrated book on
 
traditional Kentucky woodcrafts is being prepared for the
 
University of Kentucky Press Bicentennial Bookshelf series
 
by Kenneth Clarke and Ira Kohn.
 They expect to deliver the
 
completed Manuscript to the press in the early summer of 1975.
 
Dr. Lynwood Montell and Mike Morse are currently working
 
on a manuscript dealing with Kentucky folk housing.  The work,
 
also a part of the Bicentennial Bookshelf series, duals with
 
architecture, function, aesthetics, and other aspacts of
 
folk housing in Kentucky.
 
Among the first four works to appear in the Bicentenn-
ial series is Kennett
. and ;
Mary Clarke's book, The Harï¿½xast and
  
The Reapers. 
Initial response has been favorable to this much
 
needed work, which traces the development of the discipline
 
of folklore in Kentucky.
 
Newsletter Exchange
  
Students in the program here have shown an interest in
 
activities of other folklore programs and organizations=
 
however, we often hear of these events only after they have
 
taken place.
 In an attempt to remedy this situation, we
 
would like to begin a reciprocal exchange of newsletters
 
with other folklore programs and organizations.
 In this
 
4
 
n
 
manner we could not only exchange news, but also publicize
 
future activities that might be of interest to others.
 If
 
your program or organization is interested in this exchange,
 
please let us know.
 
Notes and Queries
  
I want to make note of an alternative solution for the
 
use of printed questionnaires in linguistic surveys.  The
 
long, formidable list of questions has always seemed awkward
 
to me.  Three fundamental facets of the questionnaires need
 
to be revieweds  1
.
 the definition of the object or belief
 
is rigid and possibly not suitable for all geographic areas
 
surveyed; 2
.
 the use of printed multiple-choice answers is
 
complex and might cause the informant to select a compromised
 
answer; 3
.  the length of the questionnaire is too strenuous.
 
I believe that slide projectors could be of use in these
 
surveys.
 Many items on questionnaires can be represented
 
on slides.  The slides would tend to simulate real life in
 
which the informant would observe an object visually.  The
 
result would be a spontaneous, unbiased response from the
 
informant.
 Since slides can't depict all objects or beliefs
 
needed for a good study, perhaps they could be used as one
 
part of the survey--to maintain the interest of the informant.

Publication Noteds
 
Grunfeld, Frederic V.  The Art and Times of the Guitars  
An Illustrated History of Guitars and Guitarists
  
New Yorks  Collier Books, 1974.
 
Available in paperback at a $6 savings from the price
 
of the hardcover edition, The Art and Times of the Guitar
  
functions best as an overall survey of the history and role
 
of the guitar and guitarist.  The publication includes a
 
liberal amount of footnotes, a bibliography, and an index.
 
The illustrations suffer in quality in comparison with the
 
hardcover edition.

How can we make use of the computer as a tâol to develop
 
a network of retrievable, archived material?  I would like
 
to hear from anyone who may have ideas or interests in this
 
area.

Book and Record Reviews
  
In an attempt to stimulate more interest in this
 
section of the Newsletter, the Editor will begin contacting
 
various publishers â in order to acquire specific books and
 
records for review.
 Hopefully,  if we do receive the titles
 
we request, the reviewers will be able to keep the works
 
that they review.
 If there is a current work in folklore
 
that you would like to review, let us know and we'll try
 
to obtain it.
 
Graduate School Forms
  
Folklore graduate students are reminded that there are
 
several forms that must be filled out for the Graduate School.
 
The Graduate Degree Program (Form C) should be filed before
 
completion of 10 hours credit.

ester of course work.  The Application for Degree card must

 If you have any questions about these
 
forms, please contact Ms. Chris Jenkins in the Graduate College.
 
Folklore Student Completes Internship
  
Linda White, one of our folklore graduate students,
 
recently returned from Washington, D.C. where she completed
 
an internship under Dr. Alan Jabbour, Director of Folk Arts,
 
for the National Endowment for the Arts.
 
Linda's internship consisted of seminars, designed to
 
acquaint her with the staff and agency itself, and sessions
 
with arts administrators and people from art agencies around
 
the country.
 Ms. White also gained experience in arts admin-
istration procedures in working for the Endowment under Dr.
 
Jabbour.
