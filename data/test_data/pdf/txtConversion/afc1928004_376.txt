DEIINIIOFF, Washington, D. G. 
Soon I 
will leave thee. 
My dear German Home, 
In a 
new land afar off, 
A stranger I'll roam; 
Away from the friends 
Who have loved me so dear, 
But though far away. 
In my heart ever near. 
My old German Home. 
On the banks of the Rhine, 
May the sun ot prosperity 
On it brightly shine, 
I'm going to leave thee. 
Afar off to roam, 
But I'l: never forget 
My old German Home. 
I 
see around me. 
Those friends kind and true. 
Who have loved me since childhood, 
'Tis hard to leave you; 
Soon I 
will come back 
To this good home once more, 
May prosperity attend you. 
As in days of yore. 
My old German Home, etc 
As sung by LIZZIE BRIIIAM. 
I 
arise in the morn, 
At the break of dawn. 
From a 
sleep never troubled by dreaming; 
And greet with delight, 
The glorious sight, 
Of the sun with its early beaming. 
A meal then I 
make. 
That a 
giant might take, 
For of good things T 
know I'm a 
lover; 
I 
saddle my horse, 
.The country to cross, 
And away on my nag to the cover. 
CHORUS. 
Yo, ho 
Tally ho! 
And away we go. 
Over bush, over brake and thro. briar; 
Then who can there be, 
So happy and free, 
As a 
jolly old country squire. 
The bedewed ground yields, 
As we dash thro' the fields, 
With vigor and life both bounding; 
The mare, with a 
snort, 
Seems eager for sport. 
As the huntsman's horn is resounding. 
We both sniff the air, 
Such a 
jovial pair, 
It's a 
regular hunting day, boys. 
An old one is found, 
We are off with a 
bound, 
Yoicks! tally ho! and away, boys, 
Yo, ho, etc. 
Then hark ! forward's the cry, 
The old fox must die, 
Tallboy ! yo. ho ! boys. hie over ; 
Gates and hedges we clear, 
And our horses we cheer, 
As we all dart away from the cover. 
Then thro' branches and bush, 
Fearing nothing we rush, 
Over meadows—thro' wioodland go tearing. 
At the death to be in, 
And his brush, boys, lo win, 
Not a 
fig for the danger caring. 
Yo, ho, etc. 
If your life you'd enjoy, 
And you'd still be a 
boy, 
Copy me, and be up in the morning; 
And don't be abed, 
With a 
dull sleepy head, 
And spend half your lifetime In yawning. 
Buy a 
rattling horse, 
His back jump across, 
If you haven't got one—why then get it; 
Rise tip 'with the sun, 
And I'll bet ten to one, 
That you never will say you regret it. 
Yo, ho, etc. 
THE MIDNIGHT ROAMER, 
Sung by Lezzin 131: \ II ‘
1. 
Come ye swells of noble lineage, 
And all ye swells of low degree. 
Ditto who are short and needy, 
Don chapeau and come with me: 
For I'm the king of midnight roamers. 
John the banker's wealthy son. 
A 
rig say I 
for temperance roamers. 
I 
go in for glorious fun. 
Cm-
mats. 
So who's coining out for a 
midnight ramble? 
• Who's coming out for a 
jolly good spree? 
I'll be the organ, you turn the handle, 
I'll stand the exs's. come with me. 
In the glorious Halls of Mayfair. 
I'm considered quite an fait, 
Scheming mothers with their daughters 
Think it a 
very good chance they say. 
Married life to some is charming, 
To some silly fellows its quite the thinr, 
But to me its awfully alarming: 
I 
prefer to have my fling. 
WILE'S coming Olit, 
Every night our lot assembles, 
When Big Ben is striking 1(.11. 
Bobbies gaze at us and tremble, 
When we number more than ten; 
shifting knockers, bells aptd scrapers, 
Tradesmen's sign boards ofttimes change, 
Put Jones the snob on Smith the draper. 
Smith the draper on a 
man of ehange. 
A 
WONDERFUL WORLD, 
As sung by LIZZIE BEAHAM. 
What a 
wonderful world we are in to be sure. 
What a 
babel of bustle and strife. 
And ah what a 
burden some have to endure. 
As they journey the rough road of life: 
The strongest may push to a 
prosperous end. 
While the weak and unsteady may fall. 
But no matter my friend, how we finish depend. 
Old Adam was father of all. 
'llORI:S. 
Then never despair though ye have not a share, 
Of the riches that round you may fall, 
But be to each other like sister and brother, 
For Adam was father of all. 
I 
me man may be lucky and rolling in wealth. 
Being born to his ancestors' gains. 
While another may only have honor and health. 
And a 
cranium crammed full of brains: 
But health isn't bought, nor is happiness sold, 
So a 
man shouldn't merit despise. 
For a 
sorrow may come to the lordliest home. 
And a 
joy for the lowly may rise. 
Then never despair. 
e. 
No wonder that some men are born to command. 
While others seem born to obey, 
For one man will hold all he earns to his hand. 
And another will east it away: 
But make the best use of your talents and time. 
And fortune may ,,
rivP you a 
eall. 
For despite of our creed, we are all of a 
breed, 
And Adam was father of all. 
Then never despair, &e.

Down in the Dell Were the Brambles Grow. 
Sung by LIZZIE BRAIIAM. 
Of all the girls in this wide world, 
There's none can equal Flo, 
Her home is in a 
shady dell, 
Down where the brambles grow. 
She is the darling 6.1 
my heart, 
Her beauty's quite divine, 
And in about a 
month or so 
She's going to be mine. 
1'110i:us. 
Down in the dell where the brambles grow, 
Every night I 
to ramble go. 
Kissing and squeezing my darling Flo. 
Down in the dell where the brambles grow. 
She cannot boast ul untold wealth, 
Nor yet of noble blood. 
But she can boast a 
loving heart, 
And everything that's good. 
Her parents keep a 
little farm, 
And every night I 
go, 
Sweet tales to tell this Charming belle, 
Down where the brambles grow. 
Though she's a 
simple country lass, 
I 
love her as my life, 
And all my hopes will be complete 
When she becomes my wife; 
For when my darling smiles on me, 
My heart seems in a 
glow, 
It is so sweet that girl to meet, 
Down where the brambles grow. 
• 
THE FIRE BRIGADE. 
Sung with great success by JOHN CROAK. 
Some girls may like a 
soldier, or a 
sailor or marine, 
And some with a 
policeman may think themselves a 
queen! 
While some say they'll only have a 
fellow with a 
trade, 
And some will say they'd rather live and die an old maid, 
But, I 
know this I 
can say, and I 
always speak my mind, 
A 
braver set of fellows I 
know you'll never find, 
In fact I 
mean to say they throw all others in the shade, 
Those brave and dashing fellows in the lire brigade! 
But ' poll my word, sometimes you know, I'm in a 
dreadful fright 
To see the hose carriage rushing by—it's a 
most alarming sight 
tremble for the boys, and feel dreadfully afraid, 
For they run so many dangers in the fire brigade; 
But then how dreadful it would be when there are lives to sav,e 
If there were no one to be found, who would the dangers brave 
think you must agree with me, they can't be too well paid, 
For they risk their lives for others, in the fire Brigade. 
Then may Zephyr Hose and her men be ready night and day, 
I'm sure when duty calls them, the call they will obey. 
I'll ne'er believe the cry for help will e'er be made in vain ; 
They've proved themselves brave fellows, and so they will again . 
Then let us give them all a 
cheer,—it's nothing more than right 
They're the ones I 
know deserve it well, and that with a 
might. 
To go through tire and water, they never are afraid, 
Then hurrah! for those brave fellows in the fire brigade! 
As sung by LizzlE /31:111AM. 
As we go through the whirl of life, 
I 
lowever much we grumble, 
We must be always on the move. 
And often in a 
certain groove, 
Of low estate. but small or great, 
We often get a 
tumble, 
And many things we have to do 
Which go against the grain. 
We take dm cap and wear it, 
And though very slow to declare it, 
We have to grin and bear it 
But it goes against the grain. 
A 
young man courts a 
pretty girl 
And fancies she adores him, 
But when he thinks the game is won, 
With some one else away she'll run. 
Of course he'll swear he doesn't care 
Although it nearly floors him, 
Awl all the while he seems to smile, 
It goes against the grain. 
He'll fit the cap and wear it, 
And though very slow to declare it. 
He has to grin and bear it 
But it g( )e!: against the grain. 
old maids who don't deny their age 
Is something over thirty, 
May say they hate the sight of men, 
But still we find them now and then, 
At half a 
chance return a 
glance, 
And soon get gay and flirty, 
Which shows, if they still single stay 
It goes against the grain. 
They fit the cap, & e. 
The vile garroters when they're caught, 
And that is none too often, 
Are now rewarded with the cat, 
They very much object to that; 
And if some say it's not the way. 
Their brutal hearts to soften, 
It makes them yell so we can tell 
It goes against the grain. 
But they tit the cap, kc. 
Since Farragut's day upon the sea, 
We've changed our style of fighting, 
Still the brave blue jacket. lads, 
Cooped inside the ironclads; 
Are just as game and true of aim, 
When wrongs require a 
righting. 
As every foe must know although 
It goes against their grain. 
But they fit the cap, kc. 
WILL YOU, WON'T YOU? 
As sung by LizziE BR .UT \ M. 
The girls have much to answer for. 
The way in winch they tease. 
And twirl us round their little lingers. 
Do just as they please 
I'm suffering at present. 
From one who's most unkind, 
She keeps me on the " tender books." 
And won't make up her mind. 
SPOKEN.— Although for two mortal years have I 
been period-
ieally enquiring— 
Clionus. 
Will yon, won't you, do you, don't you love your cousin Joseph ? 
Can you, can't you, shall you, shan't you tell me so, 
Do you, don't you, will you won't you smile upon your .Joseph? 
Tell me anything you like but don't say '' no!" 
Sometimes we go to parties, where 
She's awful good at flirting. 
She ;.; tys there is no harm in it. 
I 
feel it's awfully " hurting." 
I 
try to read her thoughts, I 
do, 
And watch her every glance, 
And every morning, noon and night, 
Whenever I've the chance. 
SP0E-EN.—I 
whisper— 
She'll let me make her presents—yes 
And vows I 
make—absurd. 
She listens to my promise!,„ 
But never says a 
word; 
To write her loving letters, I 
Oft sit up half the night. 
Sometimes I 
think I'm doing wrong 
When to her I 
do write. 
SPOKEN.—And after covering and crossing a 
sheet of rooLS-
cap—the proper paper for love letters— I 
put a 
I'. S.— 
Will, you, won't you, & c. 
If she'd only give a 
whisper, 
/r a •• teener 
little '• yes," 
I'd feel as though in Paradise; 
My fate I 
then could guess; 
lit neither words nor ways. alas! 
Her consent can I 
trace, 
And if I 
break my promise. 
There's a 
breach of promise ease! 
SPOKEN,—SO 
you can see the tix I'm in through— 
Will you, won't you, 'cc. 
But to test the party's feelings, 
lye hit upon a 
plan. 
I'll go and make the strongest love 
To her younger sister " Fan," 
When damsels are so cool and coy, 
And cruelly demure, 
By jove T

THE SMOKE-HOUSE GRADUATES, 
Dedicated to the (Trooly Great) Ham ( and Eggs) Brothers. 
By .TAmns F. Doom-tv. 
Don't you wish that you was us, 
A singing here so grand? 
We knock the " tar" out of them all— 
Big money we command; 
We never yet " laid off" a 
week. 
We're never short of " dates." 
There's none that meet with such succes 
As the Smoke-house Graduates. 
CHORUS. 
Then watch us while we split and kick. 
For break, turn three complete back somersaults from ear

We make the other " planets .'

[Break.—Throw a

Intermission of nine 
minutes till they come down.] 
Our reputation is huge, 
The finest in the States. 
There's no one else so versatile 
As the Smoke- house Clraduates. 
Our bareback clog is simply " big." 
Our stilt-jig makes 'em hum; 
Of course it kills the "• gillies," 
But the " gods" declare it " some" 
We bring the house down every night— 
This object we'll explain: 
'Tis to benefit the artisans, 
Who build it up again. 
Then watch us, & C. 
We can also blow the cymbals,

THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE WRONG 
As sung by LIZZIE BRAIIAM. 
Just list to my song, and I'll not keep you long. 
For I've only a 
few words to say; 
For from what I 
can see, most things seem to me 
To be going in a 
very strange way. 
.1 ust point out. I 
might. tl ,e 
way to do right, 
llut I 
then should be jeered by the throng; 
So go on your own way, you'll find out some day, 
When too late, that that's where you're wrong, 
Yes I 
I 
tell you all, that's where you're wrong. 
Of the girls of the day, I 
must first have a'say, 
You don't mean to tell me it's right 
They should dress as they do, for excepting a 
few, 
Each one to my mind looks a 
fright. 
That vile Grecian bend, does me much offend, 
Then again, there's that nasty chignon; 
I 
think they look vile, but if you like the style 
I 
tell you all, that's where you're wrong, 
Yes! I 
tell you all that's where you're wrong. 
With the girls I've not done, now just find me one

young man a 
good wife, 
And not gad about, and be always going out, 
Thus causing him °other and strife. 
I 
tell you you can't for a 
good one there arn't, 
To be picked out among the whole throng; 
I'm right, I'll be bound, there's not one to be found, 
If von think there is. that's where you're wrong, 
Yes '

tell you . dl, that ,; where you're wrong.

Oft a 
man thinks his wife his good angel through life, 
So she is too, while fortune will smile; 
But if money gets short he quickly is taught 
She's a 
demon at heart all the while. 
'hen if he should die she will sit down and cry. 
But her mourning for him don't last long; 
But with tears and with sighs for another she tries, 
If you think not why that's where you're wrong. 
Yes! I 
tell you all, that's where you're wrong. 
When a 
man's doing well, I've no need to tell 
He can meet with good friends by the score; 
When he's down, 
be bound, there's none to be found. 
They'll all of them pass by his door. 
They're afraid to go in, he might borrow some tin, 
Their objection to that is most strong; 
So him all will slight, if you think I'm not right, 
I 
tell you all that's where you're wrong, 
Yes! I 
tell you all that's where you're wrong. 
ENCORE VERSF:. 
Now you can't call it fair for you to sit there, 
And try to make me sing again, 
Though I'm glad to admit, I 
feel proud ' hove a 
bit 
When your approbation I 
gain. 
I'm a 
man with a 
mind, as you all will find, 
If you wish me to sing one more song. 
It's best to be plain,—I 
don't sing again, 
If you think I 
will that's where you're wrong, 
Yes! I 
tell you all that's where you're wrong.

ROLLING ON THE GRASS. 
To those who live in cities, 
Where but bricks and mortar's seen, 
There's nothing so refreshing, 
As " a 
little bit of green i" 
So often on a 
summer's day, 
An idle hour to pass, 
Oft to the fields I'd get away, 
And roll about the grass. 
Rolling on the grass. 
'Mongst the buttercups and daisies, 
That s 
the way, that's the way, 
An idle hour to pass; 
Rolling on the grass. 
'Mongst the buttercups and daisies, 
Fancying you're.a child again, 
Rolling on the grass. 
The prettiest of carpets ' tis, 
That ever could be found, 
With daisies sprinkled here and there, 
And Maybuslies around 7 
A bright blue roof, above o'er which 
The silver clouds sail by 
And skylarks think it but a 'ark, 
To sing up in the sky. 
CHORUS. 
While you're rolling on the grass. 
Mongst the buttercups and daisies, 
That's the way. that's the way, 
An idle hour to pass. 
Rolling on the grass, 
'Mongst the buttercups and daisies, 
Fancying yomre a 
child again, 
Rolling on the grass. 
One day, whilst I 
reclining was, 
And half inclined to dream, 
25 
T 
suddenly was startled by 
A female's piercing scream; 
Towards me rushed a 
pretty girl, 
I 
it fearful state of mind, 
And followed by a 
frantic cow, 
Unpleasantly behind. 
SPOREN.—Of course to spring to my feet and catch the faint-
ing maiden in my arms was but the work of a 
quarter of a 
second; the cow on seeing my defiant attitude came to a 
full stop, 
and stared; I 
said, waving my hat commandingly, " Go away, 
cow—go away directly !" and Sc) she did, and sent us both— 
Rolling on the grass, 
'Mongst the buttercups and daisies, 
Tlads the way, that's the way, 
That awful cow did pass ; 
Rolling on the grass. 
'Mongst the buttercups and daisies, 
Fancying you're a 
child again, 
Rolling on the grass. 
I 
often met her after that. 
And this was my excuse, 
That should 
a 
frantic cow' turn up, 
I 
perhaps might 'be of use ; 
She's going to change 'her nanic , for mine, 
When a 
few short weeks shall pass, 
And so I 
bless that blessed cow. 
And rolling on the grass. 
Ciloars. 
Rolling on the grass, 
'Mongst the buttercups and daisies, 
That's the way, that's the way, 
An idle hour to pass.

When I

You call me sweet and tender names, 
And softly smooth my tresses, 
And all the while my happy heart 
Beats time to your caresses. 
You love me in your tender way, 
I 
answer as you let me; 
But ah! there comes another day. 
The day when you'll forget me, 
The day when you'll forget me. 
I 
know that ev'ry fleeting hour 
Is marked by thoughts I 
bring you, 
I 
know there dwells a 
subtle pow'r 
In the sweet songs I 
sing you. 
I 
do not fear the darkest way, 
With those dear arms about me, 
Ah! no, I 
only dread the day 
When you can live without me, 
When you can live without me. 
And still you call me tender names, 
And softly smooth my tresses; 
And still my happy answ'ring heart 
Beats time to your caresses. 
Hush! let me put that touch away, 
And clasp your hands above me; 
So while I 
ask to die that day, 
The day you will not love me. 
The day you will not love me. 
You need not check the thoughts that rise 
With darkness wrapt about them, 
For gazing in your earnest eyes, 
My heart can almost doubt them. 
Yet hush my whispers as you may, 
Such chidings do not fret me; 
! 
no, I 
only fear that day, 
The day when you'll forget me, 
The day when you'll forget me.

With all her mother's loving ways, 
Her eyes and golden hair,

And the other floated forward all alone,

Little Sweethealt, Come and Kiss Me. 
Ad dung by D. S. WAmBoLn. 
LITTLE sweetheart, echne and kiss me, 
Just once more before I 
go; 
Tell me, truly, will you miss me. 
As I 
wander to and fro? 
Let me feel the tender pressing 
Of your ruby lips to mine, 
With your dimpled hands compressing, 
. And your snowy arms entwine.

P:a I 
lithe sweetheart, come and kiss me, 
Come and whisper soft and low, 
That your heart will sadly miss me, 
As I 
wander to and fro. 
Little sweetheart, come and kiss rae, 
We may never meet again, 
We may never roam together, 
Down the dear old shady lane. 
Future years may bring us sorrow. 
That our hearts but L'Ale know, 
will of care we should not borrow,

As sting by Amorz BENNETT. 
Why turn away when I 
draw near? 
Why cold to-day? once I 
was dear; 
Then thy heart stirred and flushed thy brow; 
Never a 
word comes to me now— 
Now thy hand lies listless in mine ; 
Once its replies spake love divine; 
Cold as if we never had met ; 
Cart it then be hearts can forget? 
CHORUS. 
Speak to me, speak— 
Be my heart heard, or it will break, 
For one kind word; 
No vows to bind, no pledge I 
seek, 
Only be kind—speak to me, speak. 
One idle day thou did'st deplore 
Some castaway, on desert shore ; 
'Twas but a 
tale, by poet feigned, 
Yet thou did.st pale, silent and pained, 
And thou did'st moan—sad, sad to be 
'Utterly lone, by the bleak sea ; 
i\ly life is drear, I, cast away--
Give me the tear thou shed'st that day.

Sung with immense.spplause by Atli. Den& 
A TINY, pretty boy was seen 
To climb his father's knee, 
And kiss his brawny cheek and say,

He pressed his pining boy, 
For her he loved had gone before, 
And Willie's end was nigh; 
He bore him to his little cot, 
And dried the falling tear, 
And Willie murmured in his sleep,

One bitter word destroy?

Wither and fade and die.

Deathless in mem'ry last ?

AS Sung by the Foy SISTERS, BERTHA AND InA. 
The regiment is forming, now, 
• 
The ranks are nearly fill'd ; 
For valor or for victory, 
Our hearts are always drill'd. 
All Irishmen unite with us. 
And give their heart's consent 
To live or die like soldiers, 
In the Irish regiment! 
In dashing uniform we/go, 
So straight in every line, 
Admiring friends their praise bestow, 
And_,say we look so fine. 
CHORUS. 
Hurrah for the Irish Regiment, that waits the bugles call, 
Gallant soldiers all, who for their flag would fall! 
Of raging war or cannon's roar, we have no fear at all—, 
We'll march away to glory in the Irish Regiment! 
We'll show the Yankee nation 
What the Irishmen can do ; 
In the Armory or battle-field, 
To duty we are true; 
When marching on the gay parade, 
We are the nation's pride; 
While the " Stars and Stripes" and Erin's flag 
Are flying side by side! 
In dashing uniform, &c., with Chorus. 
The cause we serve is Liberty! 
And we're a 
valiant band; 
Some day we'll see the tyrants fall, 
And freedom in our land; 
But far away we now must stay, 
And be with hope content; 
While marching on to victory, 
In the Irish regiment!

To meet her, my darling, my own,

I'M waiting her sweet face to see, 
While we're parted I

But soon will my heart beat with joy. 
O'er the sea I'll be sailing again; 
Again her sweet kisses of love to receive. 
For her thc sea's storms I

To meet her, my darling, my own,

High in my window two love-birds 
Hung in their cage for a 
summer long; 
Their passion had not the relief of words, 
And they did not appear to know a 
song: 
But there they nestled upon the perch, 
Beak to beak in a 
loveable way, 
Like two young lovers just fresh from church, 
And a 
look in their eyes that seemed to say— 
Cuoaus. 
Hours go by 
Let them fly 
We'll mark them with a 
kiss. 
Hours go by 
Let them fly 
The time we pass in kissing, 
The time we pass in kissing 
Is time we never miss. 
My bird's example spread far and wide ; 
There in the window they kiss'd and coo'd, 
'Till it soften'd the hearts of folks outside, 
And quite affected the neighborhood ; 
And love grew in fashion more and yet more ; 
All thro' the terrace flirtation so rag'd, 
That no one of twenty, few of two score. 
But was either just wed or else engaged.

What forward things, I 
am flll'd with shame, 
No birds so acted in my young days, 
Their brazen imlnodesty pray disown, 
And send the creatures at once to roost; 
You ought to provide them a 
chaperone, 
And see them properly introduced. 
At last came some one to see the birds ; 
Somebody came, I 
won't tell who, 
But he begg'd them of me with pleading words; 
Ask'd for them and their mistress too: 
And some how, I 
and that foolish man. 
Tho' how it bappen'd I 
cannot swear, 
Agreed to follow the Love-bird's plan, 
And make two couples instead of a

I'VE been waiting for more than an hour, love, 
Yes, waiting and watching for thee, 
While hoping and praying you'd come, love, 
And keep true your promise to me; 
For, you told me you'd meet me this evening.. 
And listen to what I've to say— 
For, to speak the plain truth, I

I

By the cowslips that grow on the lea,

I'm waiting, my darling, for thee; 
I'm waiting, yes, waiting, 
I'm waiting, my darling, for thee. 
For more than a 
year I 
have waited, 
That promise from you to receive; 
So surely you'll not break your word, love, 
And leave me your absence to grieve. 
So I'll watch and I'll wait here still longer, 
In hope of your coming this way,

The Little Flirt.— Contains the ck.erets of Handkerchio., 
Glove, and Parasol Flirtations ; the coreNst tsterpretation of all Signals, 
superior to the deaf and dumb alphabet, as the notice of bystanders 
is not attracted; the most delicate hints can be given without danger of 
) 
misunderstanding—also, the Floral language of Love. The whole form-
ing a 
rare amusement for young ladies and gentlemen. Read what two 
leading New York papers say of it: 
The N. Y. Evening Nail writes: 
"A Little Book has lately appeared in print at Mr. A. J. Fisuka's, 98 Nas-
sau street ca led the ' Little Flirt." We cannot say that we recommend 
it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, as we think it would only 
encourage the bad habit of " flirting." 
Unfortunately, there is enough 
of it done without any further necessity of explaining " how, when and 
where to do it," and this little volume would advise and initiate the un-
corrupted in practicing what is commonly called "flirting." 
The N. Y. Eeening Telegram writes: " We have lately seen a neat little 
book, bound in Morocco leather, costing twenty-five cents, called the 
"Little Flirt," published by A. J. FISHER, 
No. 98 Nassau street. 
It 
gives information of the modua operandi of flirting, and of the meaning 
of every motion of the handkerchief, fan, glove and parasol. 
As there 
is nothing at all objectionable in the volume, and its contents might af-
ford some innocent amusement to many, we do not hesitate to recom-
mend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers."

an ingenious little book of the thaumaturgic order, has been sent us, 
called Huarrxr Derasserst,' and bound in such a 
way as to give opportte 
nity for a 
decidedly puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary ase 
pearance of a 
child's picture book, gaily printed and colored, it. Is s',

practised manipulator taking it up and flirting thr, leave( 
over, can make it appear to be filled only with one picture, or with blank 
pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of figures. 
One minute the 
pamphlet, quickly thumbed, appears to contain nothing but the portrait 
of Harlequin, in his tesselated suit; the neat only Columbine, then 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or Mephistophiles. A little 
practice, and the directions printed with the book will make anybody 
at home in the handling of it."—PAil. Eve. Bull

American Fortnne-Telling Cards.—This is the old-
est and most widely known pack of Fortune-Telling Cards. We have 
published it for years, and the demand is continually increasing. 
These Cards are arringed and printed in series—Hearts, Clubs, Dia-
mond and Spades—and each or these into K for King, Q for Queen, 
and K for Knave, and numbers 1, 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
four rows, and are to be read according to directions. 
Many of the an-
swers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under-
standing. 
Many professional Fortune- Tellers use these cards, and we 
are in receipt of letters in relation to them from all parts of the U. S. 
Inclosed in handsome case . .. Price 25 Cents.

1.1 lug Ca rd..—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want fiequently felt by young people—a want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a way as to be non-committaL 
Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too diffi. 
dent or too fearful of a 
i 
epulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unlady-like encourage-
ment. 
As a 
result of this dilemma, many 
lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and befog in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
he state of their affections, which fact makes further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players. 
may be enjoyed by evening parties
