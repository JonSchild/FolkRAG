Down Around the Coast of Les Barbarees *Oh, its two gallant ships from England they did sail,So
high, so low; and so sail we;It was one the Prince of Prussia Proossia and the other, Prince of
WalesCruising around down the / Coast of Les Barbarees."Jump aloft, jump aloft," our gallant captain
cried,So high, so low, and so sail we;"Look ahead, look astern astarn , look a-lee,Look around down
the / Coast of Les Barbarees."Oh, there's nothing ahead and there's nothing astern,So high, so low,
and so sail we;But the wind is on the breakers and the lofty ship is seenCruising around down the /
Coast of Les Barbarees.But the wind is on the breakers and the lofty ship is seenCruising around
down the / Coast of Les Barbarees."Oh, hail her, oh, hail heron the gallant captain cried,So high,
so low and so sail we;"Are you a man of war or a privateer," said he,"Cruising around down the /
Coast of Les Barbarees?""Are you a man of war or a privateer," said he,"Cruising around down the /
Coast of Les Barbarees?""I'm not a man of war, nor a privateer," said he,So high, so low and so sail
we;"But I am a sassy pirate and I'm waiting for my pay prey ,Cruising around down the / Coast of
Les Barbarees.""But I am a sassy pirate and I'm waiting for my pay prey ,Cruising around down the /
Coast of Les Barbarees."Then it's two-sided broadside these two lofty ships did pour,So high, so
low, and so sail we;'Til at length the Prince of Prussia Proossia shot away the pirates' mast,Cruising
around down the / Coast of Les Barbarees."Oh, for quarters, for quarters!" a saucy pirate cried,So
high, so low, and so sail we;"But the quarters that we'll give you, we will sink you in the sea,Cruising
around down the / Coast of Les Barbarees.But the quarters that we'll give you, we will sink you in the
sea.
