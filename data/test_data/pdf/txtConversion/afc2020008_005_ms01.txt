Jack Santo interviewed by Vyta Pivo on May 24, 2021 at the Lehigh Cement Company Plant 
in Nazareth, Pennsylvania. The interview transcript has been edited for clarity.  
 
[00:00:00] 
 
Vyta Pivo:  
So, today is Monday, May 24, 2021. This is an interview for the occupational 
history archive, which is part of the Folklife Center at the Library of Congress, funded by the 
Archie Greene Fellowship. As part of this project, I'm interviewing cement workers in the 
Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania, the birthplace of the modern cement industry in the United 
States. The recording and transcript will become part of the permanent collection at the Library 
of Congress. I am Vyta Pivo and today I'm speaking with Jack Santo, at the Lehigh Cement 
Company Nazareth Plant in Nazareth, Pennsylvania. And just to confirm, you, give me your 
permission to record the interview, is that correct?  
 
Jack Santo: 
Yes.  
 
VP: 
Thank you so much. So, could we, uh, could you tell me your full name, your year of 
birth, and where you were born?  
 
JS: 
My full name is John Robert Santo. I was born ---- 1955, here in Nazareth. At that time, 
there was no, I don't think there was an Easton Hospital, but I was born in St. Luke's over in 
Bethlehem, and I went to school at Nazareth High School, started working here in 1974 and 
had my 47th anniversary last week on May 20th. That was my anniversary date when I first 
started May 20th, 1974.  
 
VP: 
Congratulations.  
 
JS: 
Thank you.  
 
VP: 
That's a lot of years.  
 
JS: 
That's a lot of years.  
 
VP: 
How did you first learn about the cement industry?  
 
[00:01:31] 
 
JS: 
Well, as a kid growing up in Nazareth, every morning when I would wake up, go to 
school, the cars were all covered with cement dust. So, you know, at that time it was Coplay 
Cement down here, Lonestar, Hercules. So, when you’re raised in Nazareth, you know about 
cement, cement, dust, so.  
 
VP: 
Did your family work in the industry?  
 
JS: 
No, my father, who's also name is John, was a printer at the Nazareth Key and my mom 
was a housewife. So, I had two younger brothers and we used to grow up, we grew up on Center 
Street, Nazareth. And that's, you know, born and raised in Nazareth. And till I got married, 
that's where I stayed till and then moved down to Wilson Borough, where I live to this day.  
2 
 
 
VP: 
Do you remember playing with cement dust?  
 
JS: 
No, I just remember trying to clean it off my dad's car by washing the car and stuff like 
that. And, uh, but yeah, I would come out of the house, stand on the front porch, and we used 
to live right up on Washington Street and Center, where I could see right straight down and I 
could see Lone Star. So, you know, when you woke up in the morning and the cars were had 
cement dust on, you know that it's a cement community and that the private dust collectors 
weren't working quite good that night. So, but…  
 
VP: 
And then you said, that's where I want to be. 
 
[00:03:08] 
 
JS: 
No, you know, just different situations. I graduated from Nazareth, like I said, and went 
to Northampton Community College, where college just wasn't my cup of tea. So, I decided to 
go to summer help, come here as summer help. Back in 1974, the president was Dean 
Sandbrook, who knew my dad through the Jaycees in Nazareth and be as that I was 18 and 19 
years old, I was getting into trouble because you're able to, back in that day, you were able to 
drink alcohol over in Jersey at 18. So, when I graduated from high school, that's where our 
hangout was, over in New Jersey. And I tried to go to community college, like I said, it just 
didn't work out. So, I, while I was still enrolled in the community college, I worked here during 
the summer and I liked the paycheck. So, I decided to stay.  
 
VP: 
How many hours worked?  
 
JS: 
30-40 hours a week. And I was 19 years old. So, I was getting that paycheck once a 
week. And, you know, it was nice money having some money in your pocket. That way, I didn't 
have to go to my mom and dad for money and, you know, so college was done. And at that 
time, you know, you had major industry here with those cement mills. You had Ben Smith, 
Crayola was here, yet, Pfizer, you know, different, where you could make a living with a 
pension plan and stuff like that. So, I decided that this is it. This is, I'll do this the rest of my 
life.  
 
VP: 
Do you remember how much you got paid?  
 
JS: 
Six dollars and 66 cents. That's what I started with. And there were times when I was 
16 and 17 I'd be washing cars up at the local gas stations, making five bucks. You know, I also 
worked at a grocery store because they paid me 5.50 an hour. And then when I made 6.66, that 
was that was the cherry on the top, so. That's why I came here. And throughout the years, old 
classmates have started working here. Some of them have retired already. And I'm still here. 
So, it's hopefully within the next year I'll be retired.  
 
VP: 
So, what was the first job that you did at the plant?  
 
[00:06:01] 
 
JS: 
My first job at the plant was during summer help, it was to kick sand out of the kill 
room floor. Back in the old plant, we had eight little kills and in between the kills, it used to 
fill up with sand. And my job was to go between them and catch the sand out, get rid of the 
3 
 
sand so it could fill up the next day. And there was one day after the other just kitchen sand. 
And that was for summer help, you know, for the summer. And when I first became full-time 
then I was a laborer. I started it on the labor gang, also driving truck. Some of the laborers 
drove truck down in the quarry. And then in 1977, I got laid off because they were building 
this plant and I got laid off for five years and did various jobs just to keep ends going because 
I have a total of six children, four boys, two girls. And I had to keep working. So, I tended bar 
at different bar rooms in the area. Worked at, I forget the place down at Palmer Township 
making acetylene bottles, Taylor Warton, worked there, worked for Mrs. Smith Pie Company 
as a route driver. But I always knew I was going to come back to the cement mill because the 
union had got us a come back to work, the right to come back to work. So, I knew eventually 
that they would be calling me, which they did in, I think it was 1980 to come back to work, 
which I jumped at that chance to come back and been here ever since.  
 
VP: 
So, what different types of jobs did you do over times?  
 
JS: 
Yeah, I started as laborer, got laid off then and it came back. I worked as a truck driver 
down in a quarry, a PEO operator, portable equipment operator, worked on maintenance for 
almost 28 years. And then when Lehigh bought Essroc, one of my fellow millwrights who went 
under the salary side for Lehigh became maintenance manager and his name was Mike Transue. 
He offered me a maintenance supervisor position and because it was Mike, I accepted the job. 
If it would have been anybody else, I would have said no. Well, Mike originally came on the 
maintenance department when I was over there as a millwright. He joined us over there as a 
young guy and we took him, took him under our wings. We trained him. And it was nice to 
know that somebody like us could become a maintenance manager. And he did good for 
himself. So, when he came back as a boss, as a maintenance manager here, he hired a couple 
of guys first. And then he brought me and, you know, offered me a job and I accepted.  
 
VP: 
So, you trusted him?  
 
JS: 
Yes. Yes. And if it would like I said, if it would have been anybody else, I would have 
said no. But because it was Mike and I felt like I owed him something because he went on a 
limb for me. I’d go out on a limb for him.  
 
VP: 
And so, it seems like it's important to have camaraderie.  
 
JS: 
Yes. Yeah. Even to this day, deep down, I'm still a millwright maintenance guy. You 
know, I treat the guys over there like I would want to be treated. If I don't if I wouldn't want to 
do the job, I wouldn't expect them to do the job. So, I still get dirty. You know, I still will jump 
in if the guys let me just to let them know that I'm still capable of outworking them, so.  
 
VP: 
As a maintenance supervisor and manager, can you tell me what you do? What does 
your day look like?  
 
[00:10:52] 
 
JS: 
We put 10 to 12 hours in a day because I’m computer illiterate, I don't deal with 
computers very good. I'm just, it's not, I'm too old to deal with computers. I'm too old to deal 
with cell phones. You know, I had a flip phone when I came here. They told me I couldn't use 
it, I had to use one of these. But my day starts at quarter four. I wake up, jump in the car, come 
into work by 4:30, get changed. And usually I'm on a computer by quarter five, five o'clock 
4 
 
trying to get the daily schedule printed out, getting my safety conversations printed out for the 
day for the guys. And at 6:30 it's go time. And so, I lead, first thing I do is lead with a safety 
conversation. If anybody has any questions from the day before. And that, our biggest thing 
here is safety, we preach and preach safety. Also, with the Covid mess, we still have to have 
masks. I'm kind of anal about it because even though I've had the vaccine, I still wear my mask. 
My youngest son, who's in his 30s, is a police officer and his wife is a hairdresser who hasn't 
gotten the shots. So, when we go up and visit, we have to wear our we have to wear our masks 
because she's not vaccinated yet. And no matter what child I see of mine, my oldest is 43, he 
lives out in Pittsburgh, I still wear a mask. We go shopping, we wear a mask, you know, so it's 
an unfortunate thing that I'm going to end up dying with a mask on.  
 
VP: 
So, what else do the conversations about safety address?  
 
[00:13:10] 
 
JS: 
Everything safety: harnesses, reflections, where you walk, how you work, how do you 
conduct yourselves. It all has to be safe. Before we start our job, they have to inspect the area 
where they're working, make sure it's the equipment is safe, everything is safe, and then they 
can start work. And when they start, they'll look at their job sheet, what for the morning, for 
the morning job. And they do what they do best is fix or repair. And that's usually how we go 
about it day after day. Same thing, because everything breaks and we need guys to repair and 
fix and that's what we do.  
 
VP: 
Are there some things that break more often or on a predictable basis?  
 
JS: 
Uh. Things, everything breaks sooner or later, you hope it's later than sooner. Yeah, 
there are some things that wear out faster and then you get the engineer involved to see if we 
can design things differently to make it last longer. Cement is very corrosive and it wears out 
metal very fast. So, we do a lot of patching in chutes and it's very hard to keep up with that 
because of the abrasiveness. And so, we're always putting liners in or patching something until 
we can put a liner in. But yeah, when things ware out, you just got to fix them. And there are 
some places that wear out faster than others. Yeah. And it's probably the same with every 
cement mill, the same problems we have with things were the same thing happens at Hercules 
and Keystone.  
 
VP: 
So. So, how many people work under you as part of maintenance?  
 
JS: 
We have I think 17 or 18 millwrights. Some are, have been a little bit. Some have been 
here a lot. Others have just started. So, it's a balancing act by trying to train the younger kids 
with the older kids and also getting the job done.  
 
VP: 
Do they work as a team?  
 
JS: 
Yes. Well, usually we put two guys on a job, depending on the job. If it's a bigger job, 
we'll put three or four guys on it and try to mix the older guys with the younger guys and or fill 
in with somebody that hasn't been on the same job, put him on it, so he gets the experience. 
The ideal situation is to have the younger guys do every job there is, along with the older guys, 
because they know how to do it and then mix in the middle guys in the middle that might have 
done it, might not have, get them involved in it. So, it's always a teamwork kind of a thing. We 
5 
 
try not to put two younger kids together because one day they don't have the safety knowledge 
and also they don't know how to finish up the job.  
 
VP: 
How long do jobs typically take?  
 
JS: 
Uh, usually we hope they take eight hours. If it doesn't, we have an afternoon shift that 
could finish it up. If it's that big of a job to start, like I said, we'll put more guys on it. But yeah, 
our guys work eight hours a day, so most of the time there's going to be overtime at night. So, 
we'll ask for overtime. If we don't ask for overtime, we'll have the afternoon guys, which are, 
there's two afternoon guys. They could finish it up for us and then they would jump on their 
jobs that are assigned for that day.  
 
VP: 
And do they work at different parts of the plant? Do they rotate?  
 
JS: 
Yes. Right now, everybody on the maintenance gang rotates. We have a rotating 
schedule that I think it's eight weeks or nine weeks in between. They'll work in afternoon shift, 
they'll have a long weekend, and then they'll have a weekend where they have to work and it 
just keeps rotating. So, on one particular Monday, we might have six guys that two guys are 
on afternoon shift, two guys are on long weekend, and two guys might have vacation. So, like 
Monday is a good example is like today, we're shorthanded today because we have six guys 
off right now. So, Tuesday gets a little better because we'll ask for overtime for the guys that 
are on long weekend, that are off Monday and Tuesday. We'll ask them to work their Tuesday 
to just increase, help us knock down the workload a little bit.  
 
VP: 
How is maintenance work at the plant different from other types of maintenance work?  
 
JS: 
I don't know. I, this is the only job I've ever had. I, this is I, like I said, I've spent 47 
years here. This is the only maintenance job I've had.  
 
VP: 
And when you hire people to come in and work here, are there particular experiences 
or skills that you're looking for?  
 
[00:19:10] 
 
JS: 
Uh, we really not like to hire outside people because we'd rather do it in-house and have 
people promote themselves. But there gets a point in time where you don't want to be 
overloaded with new kids that have never done it. So, yeah, we do have to look outside and 
there it's very hard because some of their principles that they've developed elsewhere do not 
match ours. So, it's like a balancing act. We have a certain amount of time that we can see 
whether a person is going to be a good fit or not and usually we’ll make a quicker decision. 
But yeah, guys that have never worked in a cement mill really don't know what they're looking, 
getting involved in. And, you know, a couple of things is when you're going to get dirty, 
because it's cement, it's dusty. But we, you still got to fix stuff with, you know, your basic tools, 
your ratchets, your hammers, chisels, bars, and nuts and bolts, welding. We do a lot of welding 
and …  
 
VP: 
So, are there particular skills that you're looking for, personal qualities, because some 
of these guys don’t necessarily have maintenance experience. Are there particular personal 
qualities that you're looking for?  
 
6 
 
[00:20:47] 
 
JS: 
Well, we're looking for somebody that is going to be here every day. We're looking for 
somebody that knows how to weld, knows how to put a pump together and that wants to work. 
What I've noticed is the younger generation, [would] rather play with their phones and play 
games on their phones instead of. The older generation where, we kind of dig in and get the 
work done and years ago, we used to have a saying, eight hours of work for eight hours of pay, 
you know. And I firmly believe that because I'm here so long, I do like to work. I don't like to 
be on the phone because I don't know how to work the phones so, these young kids know how 
to play the phone so they, and it does become a hindrance after. And so, we try to direct the 
kids to put their phones away—you here to work. And we usually take care of that problem 
pretty quick.  
 
VP: 
Is there a requirement to not have the phone on hand when you're working?  
 
JS: 
Uh, no, no. So, we want some we want them to have a phone if it's their personal phone, 
because that way, one, I can call them if they don't answer the radio or if they get in trouble, 
they can call me because I always have my phone on or they look it up on how to do something 
or if they need some kind of knowledge of what they're working on, they'll Google something 
and look it up online. But, you know, there's still a fine line between misusing the phone and 
using it for work. So, we try to keep the phones away until you absolutely have to use it and 
then we'll go from there.  
 
VP: 
How else has work at the plant changed over time, over all these years?   
 
[00:22:57] 
 
JS: 
Uh, it's a bigger plant than the old plant. At the old plant, there were smaller piles at 
this bigger plant, it's bigger piles. The same piece of equipment at the younger, at the older 
plant you still get to, you still get a pile at the new plant. And this isn't the new plant anymore, 
this plant is 50 years old. So, it's starting to show its age a little bit, which means more 
maintenance, you know. But overall, I think this plant is a lot cleaner than the old plant, and 
even though it's bigger, I think we do a better job of maintaining and make it look nice, make 
sure it looks presentable for the people that come in for tours and people that drive by. So, you 
know, there's always something to clean, always something to fix, always something to 
maintain. And there's always going to be work here. Always.  
 
VP: 
Do you feel like before the focus was more on the manufacture and now the work is 
very big on maintenance? Or do you think it's always been a similar balance.  
 
JS: 
There's always a balance between production and maintenance, production and 
maintenance and safety. Safety has taken giant steps compared to what it was 40 years ago just 
because of the knowledge. So, yeah, there's a fine line between production and maintenance 
and there always will be, you know. Production guys got to produce, and when you produce, 
you're going to break things. And that's what we're here for, to fix them. But you still got to do 
it safely. And that's the biggest thing I've seen here is, compared to the old plant, was taking 
more of a precaution for safety, yeah. 
 
VP: 
And so, has part of that related to governmental regulation as well? 
 
7 
 
[00:25:31] 
 
JS: 
Well, that government regulation has to do with MSHA, we’re controlled with MSHA 
here. I care what MSHA thinks, but I got to think what what's best for me and what's best for 
my guys. If I feel it's unsafe, I'll do something about it, whether it's in a book or not. If one of 
my workers feel it's unsafe, we will take care of the problem right away. I will never question 
anybody on safety. If there is a question on it, we have a safety committee here that will get 
the guys involved and if there's a disagreement with, we'll work it out.  
 
VP: 
Is maintenance the most dangerous job in that way because you’re dealing with tools 
and technologies?  
 
JS: 
Uh, maintenance guys are prone to get hurt easier because of the tools, the hammers, 
the pinch bars. You still have to use a hammer. You still have to strike the hammer on a pinch 
bar. You're still going to miss, you're still going to hit yourself with a hammer and it's still 
going to bleed. So, you can be as careful as you want and things happen. And … at least that 
that's my opinion. We just try to make sure everybody is in the right frame of mind to go home 
at night. That's my biggest concern now, because, like I said, I'm one year away from retiring 
and I just want to make sure that everybody that comes to work on Monday goes home on 
Monday. And so, I try to do my best to make sure everybody works safe, think about what 
they're doing and, you know, just go about it safely.  
 
VP: 
What's the most challenging job you’ve worked at the plant over the years?  
 
[00:28:00] 
 
JS: 
This job right here—maintenance supervisor. Making sure that everybody works eight 
hours. And like I said, a lot of that has to do with the phones. For some reason, guys think that 
when they're done with the job, it's time to check your phone out, see who called, play the 
games on the phone. And since I don't know how to do that, that irritates me, so. We never run 
out of work here, there's always work to do, always jobs to do. If he's on the phone talking to 
his wife about supper, that's not the time. Now, you're on my time, that you could find that out 
when you're driving home, you know, but that's the biggest thing, making sure I get eight hours 
of work out of everybody.  
 
VP: 
What's, what would you say is your favorite part of the job?  
 
JS: 
My favorite part of my job is going home after eight hours, see my wife, see my 
daughter who still lives at home, and going to see my grandson play baseball. So, but no, it's 
just the camaraderie with the guys. Like I said, I see Mike every day, a couple of the other 
bosses of the company we've become good friends because I see them every day for hours 
amongst hours. And but once it's time to go home, that's, I spend more time here than I do at 
home, you know, because like I said, I'm here 10, 12 hours a day and my day ends at 7 o'clock, 
I'm in bed by 7:00, wake up at quarter four and I have time to go home to see my wife, eat, go 
to a game till 7 o'clock, leave early to go to bed. I mean, I still need sleep, you know.  
 
VP: 
So, how many hours a week do work? Yeah, it’s over 40 for sure.  
 
8 
 
JS: 
The hours that I work that it doesn't bother me. I have, I know what my job is, what it 
consists of. If it needs less hours, it needs less hours. If it needs more hours, I put more hours  
in. I just feel comfortable putting those hours in to make sure that I'm doing my job correctly.  
 
VP: 
You mentioned you have classmates and other parents who came into the cement 
industry later after you started.  
 
JS: 
Yes. 
 
VP: 
What do you think attracted them to the industry?  
 
[00:30:52] 
 
JS: 
The money. Yeah. And those guys, most of them retired already. And I get mad when 
I see that, you know. But they went to school, instead I came here and then when they got done 
with school or didn't make it out through school, they got hired here. And I might have had five 
or six or seven classmates that were here. And some of them, some of them retired already, 
even though they were the same age, they went early. I and I can't go early yet. Some of them 
had died. We have one gentleman that died maybe three months ago, a nice, healthy guy, 65 
years old, 66, retired a few months prior, maybe a year prior, and died while he was taking a 
walk. And so that had me thinking, I think about this gentleman every day, you know, and I've 
started to do the footwork to retire, talking to different people and getting the my financial stuff 
in order to retire.  
 
VP: 
What's had you working for so long?  
 
JS: 
Paying back my son's weddings. When, my four boys are married, so I don't have a lot 
of money in the bank, so I had to take out home equity loans to pay for weddings and stuff, just 
to pay them back. Actually, my wife screwed up on the last one because I should have been 
retiring this year, but she thought I would be able to work another year. So, she made it to 60, 
67, which is next year. So that's when the last loan gets paid off.  
 
VP: 
Do you have any siblings working in the industry as well?  
 
JS: 
No, not even though they did work here as summer help. Three of my boys worked 
here, I have a police officer, I have a computer genius that works for Pitt University. My other 
son lives down in Maryland. He's a pharmaceutical sales representative and my other one is a 
physician's assistant. He put himself through school, he went to the Air Force, put himself 
through school. So, he was my problem son. He's a firm Trump backer, and he also believes in 
the conspiracy theory, what's going on now. So, and he lives in Arizona.  
 
VP: 
So, you mentioned working during the pandemic has been challenging. How has it 
changed the work in the plant?  
 
[00:34:11] 
 
JS: 
And, uh, the work hasn't changed, the work still is still there. But you have to watch 
how people work together without being contagious or spreading Covid. You have to be honest 
about it with yourself. Everybody still wears a mask, even if you've had the vaccine, you still 
have to wear a mask here. But what it does entitle you to is if somebody has you on your contact 
9 
 
list and they get Covid, you don't have to take the ten days off or seven days off, because you 
have the vaccine, you can stay working. And because most of our guys are younger, I don't 
think they appreciate the amount of work that goes into keeping everybody safe. They figure 
since they're young, if they catch it, they're off for 14 days and they come right back to work. 
They don't see the other side of it, where people are at my age dying because of this Covid. 
Like I said, I wear my mask almost 20 hours a day.  
 
VP: 
Do you think that you have a different appreciation for safety and you value safety 
differently because of the way you started working in the industry in the 1970s and experienced 
a different standard?  
 
JS: 
Pertaining to Covid? 
 
VP: 
No, just in general that safety is a value that carries over into Covid.  
 
[00:36:10] 
 
JS: 
Well, young kids that come into this business have no idea what safety is, so they have 
to be trained and who's going to train them? The guys that have already been trained and the 
management. That's why we have safety meetings every day discussing millions of different 
topics; three or four times a week, it's about Covid, it's about life itself with covid. It's about 
my wife, my kids, my grandkids with Covid. And eventually they get it because they're going 
to start having kids that go to school and the kids stay home from school because of Covid, 
because the teachers and how it becomes political with the teachers unions and stuff like that. 
And so, it's a fine balance, you know. You have to do with what your family, what you think 
is right. And all this nonsense on TV, whether you're Republican or Democrat, it's a crock of 
shit, excuse my language. But it is. And that has to do with being safe. Now, is the CDC 
blowing smoke up everybody's butt? Might be. Did it actually come from China? Might have. 
Because there's so much bull that's going over TV, I don't even watch news anymore. I just get 
tired of it, because it's on 24 hours a day and you just get tired of it, you know? So, what I tell 
the guys here at work, you have to do what you think is best for you and your family. If you 
want to wear a mask, you wear a mask, just like the new ruling for the CDC that you don't have 
to wear mask. Well, that's ridiculous because, and I go right back to one of my experiences last 
Sunday, my oldest son had a lacrosse game. Everybody was lined up along the sidelines 
watching the lacrosse game. Not one of them had a mask on. My wife and I are sitting next to 
a pavilion on a bench by ourselves holding my two other grandkids. We have to wear a mask 
because my daughter-in-law decides not to get a vaccine. So, halfway through the crossmatch, 
it started to rain. Now, CDC says as long as you're outside, you don't have to wear a mask. It 
starts raining. You have 75 people in a small area in the pavilion, because it's raining there out 
of the rain, so close to one another that if somebody had Covid, everybody's going to get Covid. 
My wife and I, when it started raining, we go in our car and it was just, the CDC is wrong with 
their ruling, but that's not for me. I just listen to what they say, listen to what our human resource 
people here tell me, tell us to do and I act on it.  
 
VP: 
How has the labor union participated in this conversation?  
 
JS: 
Uh, we treat masks as a tool, if I say you have to wear a mask, you have to wear a mask. 
As long as you could stay six feet apart, your mask can come down on your neck or on your 
chin. The minute somebody violates your six feet space, that mass has to go on. If you're riding 
in a truck by yourself, your mask can be down. If you're riding in a truck with a passenger, 
10 
 
your mask has to be up. And we try to maintain, as long as you're working with somebody 
within six feet, you have to wear a mask. 
 
VP: 
Have some workers refused to wear the mask? 
 
JS: 
No. From day one, they didn't like it, but they did it. And sure, we had people that had 
Covid that had to go home. But then the guys realized that if they don't listen to what 
management is saying about the mask and they're on that person's contact list, that they're going 
to get sent home and not get a paycheck. So, that's why right now our main concern is getting 
everybody vaccinated, because that way you can stay working even if your name is on a contact 
list. It was hard because guys would be off for 10 days or 14 days, come back and then have 
their name on another person's list so that they could be gone two, three weeks without a 
paycheck. But even to this day, they haven't gotten the vaccine. So, and like I said, it's totally 
up to the person to get a vaccine. I get that. But all my kids, except for the one, have gotten 
vaccines. And because my son is … and he is a nurse and he wears, he wears a mask, but he 
hasn't gotten the vaccine yet.  
 
VP: 
Yeah, it’s a challenging family situation.  
 
JS: 
It is. I mean, I can talk to a blue in the face and he will not get it. He will not get a shot, 
I know it.  
 
VP: 
Well, thank you for your time. Is there something you would like to add or maybe there's 
a question I didn't ask or something you would like to mention?  
 
JS: 
No, just that a few years ago, I was nominated for Worker of the Month and we have  
 
VP: 
Congratulations! 
 
JS: 
Thank you. Well, that was about two, three years ago. So, we have a historical society 
around here over in Northampton. So, my picture hangs in that society as a Worker of the 
Month. And that was right before I came to the salary side, so. My kids are nice, when we, 
when the kids come in, I take them over every once in a while and they see their old man that 
try to make something of myself, you know. And I want my kids to realize that I am a hard 
worker, a good father, good provider, put kids through school, raise the family, and now it's 
one more year to go. And then I could just sit back and help my kids develop their careers and 
stuff like that and, or cut their grass or, you know, do their dishes, do their clothes, wash their 
clothes. But again, thank you for the opportunity, I greatly appreciate it. And if there's anything 
else I can help you with, feel free to call.  
 
VP: 
Thank you so much.
