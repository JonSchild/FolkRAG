No need for advertising. 'We've got it from mouth to 
mouth." Customers spread the word about Webb's 
Barbershop. 
King Davis 
01:43 
King Davis was born in Gurley, Louisiana. Moved to Baton 
Rouge in 1951. 
02:06 
Davis's stepfather was a 
barber. He wanted Davis to be a 
barber because they "made pretty good change." Davis 
went to barber school in Houston at the age of 16 for about 
a 
year. He then returned to Baton Rouge where he 
eventually went to work in his stepfather's barbershop, a 
shop that he had been running since 1924. 
03:55 
Sidebar on Lincoln Hotel next door. Now abandoned it was 
built in the late 1950s for an African American clientele. 
Largest hotel of its kind at the time for Blacks.

Five barbers worked in his step-father's barbershop when 
Davis first started. He was the second youngest among 
them. Davis's oldest brother also cut hair in the shop. 
Davis has worked at the shop his entire career. At age 
78 he still works part-time at the shop, now as the owner 
operator. 
05:08 
Lots of razzing by older barbers when Davis first came on 
the job. "You know that. That's way they do it, young men. 
Man, put you up a 
tree backwards, almost. Tell you, you 
don't know how to do this, boy. You don't know how to do 
that, boy. Let me show you." Now Webb's is the leading 
barbershop in the city. 
05:44 
Although Davis learned the fundamentals in barber school, 
they didn't teach him "how to cut no hair." Davis talked 
more about starting out in his step-father's shop. Small 
grinder in the shop used to sharpen the clipper blades. 
Started out with hand clippers. "You cut two heads a 
day, 
your hand be tired." Electric clipper soon came into use. 
06:59 
Davis gave more examples of tricks played on barbers in 
the shop. 
08:22 
Davis talked about one of the barbers named Leroy Smitty. 
He was a 
joker. " He'd run a 
joke across you so quick it'd 
make your head spin." Davis took his tools after he had a 
stroke in the shop. 
09:52 
Davis talked about giving shaves. No longer uses a 
straight 
razor with a 
strop. Now uses a 
razor with three blades on 
the head. The blades are disposable. Davis talked about 
sharpening his straight razors using a 
hand grinding stone. 
"You strap [strop] it. That still keeps the edge on it. 
11:47 
Davis talked about the tools used when he first started 
barbering and now. Older brother showed Davis much he 
didn't know including better ways to shape the hair. His 
older brother died in 2001.

Davis talked about using various guards on the clipper. He 
also talked about his skill using a 
scissor and comb to 
shape the hair. Younger barbers in the shop use clippers 
with a 
guard instead. Davis has customers who come to 
him because he uses old-style scissor and comb to 
"shingle" the hair out. 
15:56 
The barber next to Davis (chair #4) is an old friend who has 
worked in the shop for 41 years. His friend's son works the 
first chair (chair # 1). With but 19 years cutting hair in the 
shop, he remains the junior barber on staff. Davis's 
nephews (his brother's two sons) work chairs #3 
and #4. 
16:50 
Davis talked about different style of cuts. Philly Fade, Ball 
Fade, Ivy League, Ivy League with a 
part, and the Bush. 
"You got to remember all the hair cuts. Sometimes you see 
20 different kind a 
day." ( Note: the term King referenced is 
"fade," as in the Philly Fade cut.) More clarification on 
"shingling out" or fading out the hair. 
20:53 
"We cut white and Black hair." 
21:28 
Use of a 
style sheet to reference different hair cuts. 
Customer can pick a 
style off the sheet including 3-part, 
zig-zag (also called a 
lightening), initials, even mohawks. 
Don't do dreadlocks. 
22:56 
Davis commented on why customers come to him. Davis 
now cuts only the "older guys hair." Longstanding 
customers, some 40 to 50 years. "Want nobody to cut it but 
me, because he like the way I 
cut it and he my friend." 
Davis doesn't fool with the younger kids. " If you move, I 
don't cut." Davis doesn't mind if a 
customer switches to 
another barber in his shop.

The barbers talk all day. "You need a 
movie camera to 
catch all them cats be talking. They talk and joke ... my little 
`nep' he don't keep running his mouth." The customers 
come in part for a 
haircut, in part to be messed with. A 
good joke is a 
must. Arguing is a 
way of life in the shop, 
especially among the younger barbers, to keep the 
atmosphere lively. No more arguing with Davis. "My 
nephew used to drag me like a 
chicken." Davis has a 
bad 
heart so he cut that out. Davis tries to find out the 
customer's interests to keep the conversation flowing. 
28:31 
Lady barber worked in the shop for 12 years. Do not allow 
any cursing in the shop. "Anything other than that, she was 
right there." Rules apply. Act crazy in the shop, Davis will 
put you out. 
30:17 
Davis talked about dealing with mothers. 
31:32 
Barbershop is strictly first come, first serve. Most 
customers who come in like a 
particular barber's style and 
will wait for that barber. Sometimes as many as 8-10 
customers waiting in line for a 
particular barber. 
33:13 
Two weeks. Average time for customers to return for 
another haircut. Some customers come in twice a 
week. 
The second visit, typically, they have their hair "lined" (cut 
around the edges) with clippers and razor. 
34:25 
Davis shared humorous stories of some of the mistakes he 
and the other barbers have made cutting their customer's 
hair. 
35:43 
Lots more competition today. Black barbershops 
throughout the city. Back porch unlicensed barbers also 
operate. Davis has had customers from other states. One 
women from Texas brought her boys every two weeks. 
37:53 
Had three shoeshine men at one time. No room today. 
Shoeshine trade according to Davis is going out. "Only pair 
of shoes he rub 'em on himself to go to church with.

Haircuts change every 6 
to 8 
months. Still use chart to refer 
to old-style haircuts. "Oh man, they change styles like they 
change shoes." One of Davis's younger customers wanted 
a 
different kind of haircut every time he came in. Difficult to 
cut hair with oil or grease. White boys (some from the LSU 
and Southern football teams) come to get their Philly Fade 
or Ball Fade haircuts. 
42:09 
With new-style haircuts customers tend to be particular. If 
they don't like what Davis has done, they will move down 
the line to another barber. Davis enjoys older fellows 
because they tend to be ball headed. Davis is known as 
the "5-minute man." 
44:43 
Shaping beards and lining mustaches. Davis has worn his 
beard for 52 years. Uses electric clipper and straight razor 
with throw away blades. Beards very popular these days. 
"Everybody who can grow a 
little hair got some hair." 
46:30 
Good pair of clippers will last 8 
to 10 years. Need to buy 
new blades, as well. Clipper blade may last as long as 12 
to 14 years. 
47:36 
Davis semi-retired now. Shop is closed on Mondays. Davis 
works Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays. Wednesdays 
and Saturdays are his fishing days when he "hangs out" in 
the country. "I 
got tired of working hard everyday, 
everyday." Oldest nephew will take over shop (#3 
chair) 
when Davis steps down. All is written into a 
will. 
50:29 
Serving the larger community. Davis allows health testing 
for males in the parking lot across the street. Talked about 
free haircuts for poorer families. 
52:25 
Haircut prices go up every 7 
to 8 
years. Priced at 75 cents 
for a 
haircut, 50 cents for a 
shave, when Davis first started 
barbering. Now priced at $ 12 for kids, $ 15 for grown-ups, 
$7 for a 
shave. Barbers pay rent for chair. Everything they 
use they have to buy. Everyone has to wear a 
white smock.

Hat rack in the shop has changed over time. Now 
customers wear ball caps of every description. Dress for 
barbers in the shop was once more formal. Back in the day 
Davis wore a 
dress shirt with necktie under his smock. 
Barbers in shop today wear open neck shirts or white 
t-shirts. They can't wear their shirt tails out if they are 
longer than their smock. 
56:41 
How people address Mr. Davis. Davis's two brothers now 
deceased. Talks about how the neighborhood has 
changed. Many businesses are no longer. Many buildings 
in the area have been razed. "Started leaving out and 
tearing them down." Webb's off limits to robbers. Davis has 
pistols at the ready. 
01:00:15 
"Talk" elevated to an art form at Webb's Barbershop. 
Regular customers know they need to get their act (their 
talk) together before they walk in the door. Kids come in 
and do a 
dance, then egg Davis on about trying it out. "My 
legs don't work like that," is Davis's reply. 
01:01:39 End of interview.
