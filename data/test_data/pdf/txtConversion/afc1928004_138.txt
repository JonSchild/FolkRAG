THE MONEYLESS MAN. 
Is there no secret place on the face of the earth 
Where charity dwelleth, where virtue hath birth ? 
Where bosoms in mercy and kindness will heave, 
And the poor and wretched shall ask and receive. 
Is there no place on earth where a 
knock from the poor, 
Will bring a 
kind angel to open the door ? 
Ali I 
search the wide world wherever you can, 
There is no open door for a 
moneyless man! 
Go look in your hall where the .chandelier's hg lit 
Drives off with its splendor the darkness of night, 
Where the rich hanging velvet in shadowy folds 
Sweeps gracefully down in its trimming of gold. 
And the mirrors of silver take up and renew, 
In long lighted vistas the wildering view ; 
Go there in your patches, and find if you can, 
A welcoming smile for a 
moneyless man I 
Go look in your church with the cloud reaching spire, 
Which gives back to the sun his same look of red fire ; 
Where the arches and columns are gorgeous within, 
And the walls seem as pure as a 
soul without sin 1 
Go down the long aisle, see the rich and the great 
In pomp and the pride of their worldly estate— 
Walk down in your patches and find if you can, 
Who opens a 
pew to a 
moneyless man I 
[I] 
THE MONEYLESS MAN.—[CoNctunEo. 
Go look to you judge in his dark flowing gown, 
With the scales wherein law weigheth equity down, 
Where he frowns on the weak and smiles on the strong, 
And punishes right, while he justifies wrong. 
Where jurors their lips on the Bible have laid, 
To render a 
verdict they've already made— 
Go there in the court room, and find if you can, 
Any law for the cause of a 
moneyless man I 
Go look in the banks, where Mammon has told 
His hundreds and thousands of slyer and gold, 
Where save from the hands of the starving poor, 
Lies pile upon pile of the glittering ore. 
Walk up to the counter, ah ! there you may stay 
Till your limbs grow old, and your hairs turn gray, 
And you'll find at the banks not one of the clan 
With money to lend to a 
moneyless man ! 
Then go to your hovel no raven has fed, 
The wife who has sufftred too long for her bread, 
Kneel down by her pallet and kiss the death frost 
From the lips of the angel your poverty lost ! 
Then turn in your agony upward to God, 
And bless while it smites you with the elvist Meg rod; 
And you'll find at the end of your life's little 
an 
There's a 
welcome above for a

"TT/ A TWIN." 
SUNG BY Mn. 'TOWARD PAUL IN THE CHARACTER OP 
66 STALEY M YLDENV, THE POOR RELATION." 
In form and feature, face and limb, 
I 
grew so like my brother, 
That folks got taking me for him, 
And each for one another; 
It 'Puzzled all our kith and kin, 
It reached a 
fearful pitch, 
For one of us was born a 
twin, 
And not a 
soul knew which ! 
One day (to make the matter worse), 
Before our names were fixed, 
As we were being washed by nurse, 
We got completely mixed; 
And thus you see, by fate's decree, 
Or rather nurse's whim, 
My brother John got christened me, 
And I 
got christened him. 
This fatal likeness even dogged, 
My footsteps when at school; 
And I 
was always getting flogged, 
For John turned out a 
fool, 
I 
put this question fruitlessly, 
To every one I 
knew. 
What would you do if you were me, 
To prove that you were you! 
Our close resemblance turned the tide, 
Of my domestic life, 
For, somehow, my intended bride, 
Became my brother's wife. 
In fact, year after year, 
The same absurd mistakes went on; 
And when I 
died the neighbors came 
And buried brother John. 
O'BLARNEY. 
PARODY. 
Am—Kato Kearney. 
Oh! have you not heard of O'Blarney, 
Who came all the way from Killarney, 
If you wear a 
black eye, 
Take a 
warning and fly. 
For a 
broth of a 
boy is O'Blarney. 
When the pooteen, that's whisky, is steaming, 
'Tis nought but of fighting he's dreaming. 
And, och, I 
can tell, 
Where mischief does dwell— 
The shillelah of Paddy O'Blarney. 
Then should you ere meet this O'Blarney, 
Who rode all on foot from Killarney, 
Beware of his smile, 
Mind your eye all the while, 
A 
shellelah has Paddy O'Blarney. 
Though he looks so, 
bewitchingly simple, 
Och, faith, but he'd soon crack your pimple, 
And should he inhale 
A 
drop of the rale, 
Then's fatal the blow of O'Blarney. 
SHE IS FAR FROM THE LAND. 
She is from the land where her young hero sleeps,. 
And lowers are round her sighing; 
But coldly she turns from their gaze and weeps, 
For her heart in his grave is lying— 
For her heart in his grave is lying. 
She sings the wild song of her deaf native plains, 
Every note which he loved unchanging; 
Ali I 
little they think who delight in her strains, 
How the heart of the minstrel is breaking. 
He had lived for his love, for his country he died, 
They were all that to life had entwined him; 
or soon shall the tears of his country be dried 
Nor long will his love stay behind him. 
Oh, make her a 
grave where the sunbeams rest, 
Wh-Rn they promise a 
glorious morrow; 
They'll smile o'er her sleep, like a 
smile from the West, 
From her own loved island of sorrow

THE HEATHEN CHINEE;" 
" 
THE HEATHEN OHINEE ;" 
OR, PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES. 
Words by BRET HARTZ. 
Music by Hits AY TUCKER. 
[The Music of this piece, arranged for the voice and pianoforte, is 
published in DeTritt's Half- Dime Series of Choice Music. For sale by 
R M. Ds War, 33 Rose Street. 
Price Five cents., 
Which I 
wish to remark— 
And my language is plain— 
That for ways that are dark, 
And for tricks that are vain. 
The heathen Chine° is peculiar, 
Which the same I 
would rise te, explain. 
Ah Sin was his name; 
And I 
shall not deny 
In regard to the same, 
What that name might imply, 
But his smile it was pensive and child- like, 
As I 
frequent remarked to Bill Nye. 
It was August the third, 
And quite soft was the skies, 
Which it might be inferred 
That Ah Sin was likewise. 
Yet he played it that day upon William, 
And me in a 
way I 
despise. 
Which we had a 
small game, 
And Ah Sin took a 
hand; 
It was Euchre. 
The same 
He did not understand. 
But he smiled as he sat by the table, 
With the smile that was childlike and bland. 
Yet the cards they were stocked 
In a 
way that I 
grieve, 
And my feelings were shocked 
At the state of Nve's sleeve; 
hich was stuffed full of aces and bowers, 
And the same with intent to deceive. 
[1] 
OR, PLAIN LANGUAGE FROM TRUTHFUL JAMES--LCONCLIJDED.) 
But the hands that were played 
By that heathen Chine°, 
And the points that he made 
Were quite frightful to see; 
Till at last he put down a 
right bower, 
Which the same Nye had dealt unto me. 
Then I 
looted np at Nye, 
And he gazed upon me 
And he rose with a 
sigh, 
And said, " Can this be! 
We are ruined by Chinese cheap labor;" 
And he went for that heathen Chineo. 
In the scene that ensued, 
I 
did not take a 
hand, 
But the floor it was strewed 
Like the leaves on the strand, 
With the cards that Ah Sin bad been hiding, 
In the game" ho did not understand." 
In his sleeves, which were long, 
Be had twenty-four packs, 
Which was coining it strong, 
Yet I 
state but the facts; 
And we found on his nails, which were taper, 
What is frequent in tapers—that's wax. 
Which is why I 
remark,— 
And my language is plain,— 
That for ways that are dark, 
And for tricks that are vain. 
The heathen Chine° is peculiar, 
Which the same I 
am free to maintain. 
I WISH MY SALLY COULD SEE ME

I WISH MY SALLY COULD . [CONCLUDED.] 
My Sally's an infamous jilt, to her I 
was going t..) be wed, 
But I 
wasn't—oh no, she went off, and married another instead, 
She called me a 
lumbering lout, and treated me just anyhow, 
I 
think that she'd alter her tune, if she could but look on me now. 
SPOKEN - -Ville Veathers make vine birds—oh Sally, Sally, if 
thee wanted to marry a 
suit of clothes, why didn't thee tell I 
so ? 
I'd a 
come (
low!)a i 
nnirried thee drest like I 
am now, in a 
suit 
of clothes lit for a duke—but thee wentest off and married that 
skulemaster as ain't got money ettow' to dress like this—but thee 
shalt see me, Sally—thee slia;t see that Tony can look like a 
swell. 
I 
wish, oh, clang it— Chorus. 
Directly to "motion I 
got—I'd scarce jumped out o' the train, 
When I 
found the place to buy clothes is a 
street called Petticoat 
Lane. 
The tailors there were so polite, they suited Inc after a 
Lit, 
And they every one of 'em said, these clothes were a 
beautiful fit. 
SPOKEN—They ought to know thee knows, I'd bought the 
clothes; they cost me over four pun ten and the hat in. 
I 
said to 
tailor chap, ain't this rather loose here ? 
Loose, said he, now 
s'elp me port my vord—loose, no my boy, it's beautiful, worth 
dr)uble the moniesh, too. 
I 
said I 
ought to be taken in just here. 
Moses and Son, said he, Moses and Son, ve've taken you in quite 
enough—it's beautiful—it's the fashion—and so it is. 
Sally, thee 
might'st ha' had me and coat and all—but I 
wish she were here 
to see, I—I'd rile her—oh, I 
wish—aoruS. 
I 
know that all ways I'm a 
swell, for every one I 
meet, 
No matter if female or male, stops and stares at me in the streets, 
So Sally may go to the—well, it's no bit use to kick up a 
row, 
She'd be dying of envy if she could only just look on me now. 
SPOKEN—Eh, lads, thee doesn't often see yolks come out so 
extensive in tunnun. 
It baiut only the clothes, it be the figure as 
well—even the little poor boys in the street ha' bin a 
noticin. 
I 
Leered one say, Bill, d'ye see that blooming svell with the Grecian 
Bend on his shoulder? 
Yes, says the other ; vv, he's got the 
Roman Fall in von leg, and ram me into a 
rifle, if he ain't got the 
Almandria limp in his body. 
Yes, says a 
cabman, he's limp 
enough all over.

POOR OLD MIKE 
I 
was reared in Doncaster, 
Some forty years ago; 
But times are very different 
As many of you know. 
I've had my share of sunshine, 
Of course I 
can't complain, 
But the good old days have passed away, 
And they'll never come again. 
Poor old Mike. 
CHORUS. 
But now I'm growing old, 
And my two it does decay; 
A poor old worn out stableman, 
Every one does say. 
Poor old Mike! poor old Mike! 
When I 
was rising six years old, 
They first put me across, 
One ot Lord Derby's favorites, 
For a 
trial round the course. 
So firm and neat I 
kept may seat, 
The knowing ones they stared. 
As I 
rattled in from a 
two mile spin, 
Every one declared— 
'Twas clever little Mike. 
But now, &Lc. 
Then I 
was made a 
jockey, 
It suited well my taste; 
A handy chap at a 
handicap, 
Smart at a 
steeple chase. 
East, west, north or south, 
I 
could show an open face; 
For I 
always acted on the square, 
And never sold a 
race. 
Honest little Mike! 
But now, &c. 
But soon I 
grew too big, 
I 
could neither ' train' or ' waste; 
My 
patrons, too, they died, 
So I 
was sacked in haste. 
But posting days were in their prime, 
A post-hack I 
bestrode; 
With a 
smack, Fa hip!' crack goes the whip, 
Battling down the road. 
Poor old Mike! 
But now, &e. 
But steam sOOO run us off the road, 
And rhenmatiz set in; 
'Twas. then I 
first knew poverty, 
And my troubles did begin. 
Relations, friends, acquaintances, 
All dead, or far away; 
I 
was odd man in a 
stable-yard 
At half-a-crown a 
day. 
Poor old Mike! 
But now, &v. 
By the pomp, un's beaten out-and-out, 
And bundled from the yard. 
I 
touted in 
t. Martin's Lane, 
Or sold a 
racing card. 
Sometimes I 
get the " tip," 
When an old friend comes to town, 
And there's many a 
swell for the HeNTS I tell 
Will drop Inc half-a-crown. 
Poor Uld Mike '

" 
Well, really now, you seem so bad, your looks I 
am commiserating, 
Sir," she said, " but let me see, I 
must have time to think." 
She appeared so lovely, so bewitching, and so captivating-
"Anything you make," I 
said, " my darling, I 
shall drink." 
When for sonic seconds, more or less, this charming girl had stood, 
Said she, " I 
think an eye-opener, my dear, would do you good; 
You're queer about the optics, and you're husky in the voice, 
• But there's a 
card, with list of drinks, and from it take your choice." 
Spoken--And she handed me the card with such a 
sweet smile, some-
thing like this,-you know the . 
sort of smile-what I 
call the droop. I 
took the card and read as follows-Cnonus, as before. 
Said I, " A 
private smile from you is really quite as sweet as honey, 
And a 
lady's blush is more becoming than a 
frown; 
A 
pick-me-up is very nice, and, made by you, worth any money-
I'd enjoy a 
pick-me-up if you would knock me down." 
Said she, " Oh, come now, that's enough, sir, you're inclined to rave-
1 
wish you would be quick, and tell me what you're going to have I" 
Said I, " How can I 
choose, my dear, from such a 
splendid lot ? 
I 
can't make up my mind, so I'll have everything you've got." 
_ Spoken-" What," said she, " everything ?" " Yes," I 
replied, ' every-
' 
thing on the list."--Cuonus, as before. 
Said she, " Now don't be stupid, for to take them all wonld be such folly, 
One or two I'd recommend, but pray don't take the lot; 
For, as all the drinks are iced, sir, the result would be most melancholy, 
I 
am very certain you would freeze upon the spot." 
Said I, " I 
wouldn't care a 
pin. I'd think it rather nice, 
A 
smile from you, I'm very sure, would quickly melt the ice; 
And, as I 
must make up my mind, my choice at once I'll take, 
Indulge me, please, by mixing a 
luxurious rattlesnake." 
Spoken-I 
did enjoy it, too, it slid down my throat so beautifully, and 
was so nice that I 
was induced to try the lot- she couldn't attend to any-
body else, she was so busy mixing for me. Now you take my advice, boys, 
if ever you feel seedy, just turn into the Cafe Riche, 22f> Piccadilly ; ask 
for the proprietor and mention my name-that'll be quite sufficient, you'll 
be turned out immediately. 
But before you go, say, " I 
want to taste some 
of your American drinks I've heard so much about." " Indeed!" he'll 
ejmmlate, " I'm glad to hear they are spoken of in such complimentary 
terms; will you have one with me ?" " Thanks," you'll Fay, " I 
don't 
mind." " What will you take ?" k1J say. " Well," you'll reply, "I'll 
take-Cironus, as before.

A vic-timizedyoungiTin. 
When first I 
went out to a 
ball, I 
met a 
lady fan-, 
She'd had some words with her young man, and he likewise was 
there; [immense, 
• She danced with me throughout the night, and thought the chance 
To aggravate and jealous make her chap at my expense ; 
When going home he knocked me down, and then away he ran, 
And left me in the gutter there, a 
victimized young man. 
Near Oxford street a 
girl to me said, " James, how do you do V' 
I 
said, " You have th' advantage, miss, for I 
really don't know you." 
She then commenced to scream aloud, and seem'd with frenzy 
wild, [child I" 
Saying, " Wretch, you have deserted me, and where's the darling 
And there I 
like a 
dummy stood, for satisfied I 
am, 
• I 
knew her not, I 
felt I 
wa7, a 
victimized young man. 
A 
crowd had now collected round, and all were crying shame! 
Mry- hat was smasli'd, my coat was torn before a 
policeman came. 
She said, " That is my husband, sir, who leaves me starving ., ere," 
The Bobby said, " Oh man and wife, then I 
shan't interfere." 
'When she had turn'd her back to speak, like a 
deer away I 
ran, 
The boys all following pelting me, a 
victimized young man. 
I 
refuge took behind a 
stall not far from Drury Lane, 
The mud and stones about me fell, and shower'd down like rain 
It grew so hot that out I 
got, and once more beat retreat, 
half mad and smother'd o'er with mud, to the baths in Endell 
Street; 
Like lightning through the door I 
flash'd, and didn't stop to scan 
The money-taker, for I 
felt, a 
victimized young man. 
Up-stairs I 
rushed, with worry flush'd, and didn't stop to read 
Directions as where I should go I 
was too glad to be freed 
From the boys outside who would deride and follow in my path, 
When all at once I 
found myself in the ladies' swimming bath; 
Some laugh'd, some scream'd, and all like ducks into the water ran, 
And splash'd me till I 
was wet through, a 
victimized young man. 
I know not whether they or I 
at first was most surprised, 
I 
very soon was bundled out, and of course apologized; 
An explanation settled all, I 
wash'd and brush'd my clothes, 
Then haird a 
cab, and hurried home much better you'll suppose 
I 
never now go out alone for satisfied I 
am, 
That if I 
do I'm sure to be, a 
Nictinliz,A young man.

Oh! Brigham, Brigham Young, It's a 
miracle how he survives; With his 
0-- et-74T— e r 
roaming rams and his pretty little lambs, And his five-and-forty wives. 
His number fm-ty-five is about sixteen, 
Number one is sixty-and-three; 
And they make such a 
riot, 
How he ever keeps them quiet, 
Is a €1
,-)wn-ri_rht mystery to me. 
For they datter and they claw, and jaw, jaw, jaw, 
And each has a 
different desire, 
It would aid the renown 
Of the best shop in town, 
To supply them with-ha they require.— Cho. 
BRIGHAM YOUNG.—[CONCLUDED.] 
Old Brigham Young was a 
stout man once, 
Though now he is thin and old; 
And I 
grieve to state 
He is bald on his pate, 
Which once had a 
covering of gold. 
For his youngest wives don't like white wool, 
And his old ones won't have red; 
So with tearing it out, 
Taking turn and turn about, 
They have torn all the hair from his head.—Cnonus. 
Now his girls sing psalms all day, 
And his boys they all sing songs; 
And among such a 
crowd 
He has it pretty loud, 
For they are as musical as Chinese gongs. 
But when they advance, for a 
Mormon dance, 
He is filled with the greatest surprise, 
For they're sure to end the night 
With a 
Tabernacle fight, 
And scratch out one another's eyes.—Cnonus. 
There never was a 
home like Brigham Young's, 
So curious and so queer; 
If his joys are double, 
He's a 
treble lots of trouble, 
And it gains on him year by year. 
Yet he sits in state, and bears his fate, 
In a 
serve-me-very-right sort of way; 
If there's one wife to bury,— 
There's another one to marry, 
And there's something goes wrong everyday.—Cno. 
Now if anybody envies Brigham Young, 
Let them go to the Great Salt Lake, 
And if they have leisure 
To examine their pleasure, 
They will find it's a 
great mistake. 
One wife at a 
time, so says my rhyme, 
Is enough for the proudest Don; 
So ere you strive 
To be lord of forty-five, 
Live happy,—if you can,—with one.—CnoRus.

De 
_  
- 
ter - miu'd 
on 
cut - ting 
round holes 
in 
his 
shut- tore. 
Though aged forty-five, for the first time in life 
He'd recently married a 
good-looking wife; 
She was some years his junior, and had been a 
cook, 
And made up the match when he made up her book. 
A shopman. of course, he was bound to engage, 
A cousin of his wife and about the satme tht-e. 
And of hams and of bacon the best of all cutters, 
And useful at night just to pop up the ithutters. 
THE H OLE m THE .21HUTTER.—[CONCLUDED.] 
Thus related, the shopman and good Missus D. 
Were, perhaps, not so distant as strangers might be, 
Which annoy'd Mister Drake, for he could not resist 
The idea but what somethlhg perhaps wrong might exist. 
His jealousy roused, was not quickly subdued; 
lie watch 'd, and each look into love misconstrued; 
Took nightly his pipe with a 
friend, Mister Rutter, 
And returning, he'd peep through a 
hole in the shutter. 
To her sponse, after dinner one day, Missus D. 
Said, This afternoon, dear. I 
intend taking tea 
At my old ; riend, Miss Brown's ; without thinking, no doubt, 
Of tqe shopman, whom Drake had let half-a-day out. 
So, so, said 01(1 Drake, when she'd gone, 
be bound 
That wherever they are, they together are found, 
And they'll both come home early, said he with a 
stutter, 
When I'll catch ' em alive through the hole in the shutter. 
For his usual pipe out went Drake about nine, 
Didn't stay, but returned in a 
very brief time; 
In the meantime the shopman came stealthily home, 
For a 
quiet half-hour with the servant alone; 
Straightway in the parlor the loving pair went, 
At love-making both were on overtime bent, 
And began to kiss, cuddle, and sweet things to mutter, 
Just as Drake scrambled up to the hole in the shutter. 
Now, being near-sighted, old Drake, of course, thought 
how nicely his wife and the shopman he'd caught, 
And revenge, deep and dreadful, was pond'ring upon, 
When a 
second edition of kissing came on. 
"I say," shouted Drake, " here, you sir. what's your game? 
That's my with you're kissing. 
Oh, Mary, for shame 
When something gave way, down he roll'd in the gutter; 
On shutting the shop he'd not screw'd up the shutter. 
Now, to pick up the shutter, old Drake didn't stop, 
But junm'd o'er the stall-board and rush'd in tfie shop; 
When the shopman disturb'd he for love didn't stay, 
But popp'd from the parlor and met him half-way; 
-With the laiLh! bacon knife he had courage immense, 
While Drake, with the cheese- taster stood in defence, 
When faint in the arms of old Drake, in a 
flatter, 
Fell the girl just as Missus D. came to the shutter. 
With excitement old Drake scarcely knew what to do, 
And the girl faintin7, obstinate, wouldn't come to ; 
So, unconscious of all save of ea ,ing his legs, 
Full length laid her down in a 
box of fresh errrrs ; 
Missus Drake then came in when the shopman explained 
how a 
fox had been caught and a 
Drake had been tamed, 
And shamed too, for since he a 
word never utters 
Respecting the shopman or holes in the shutters.

THE MAD BUTCHER.—[CoNcLunEn.] 
Mary Jane, you don't know her, but, ha! 
The thoughts of her now makes me start, 
She shone on my path like a 
star, 
But she stolen my pluck and my heart; 
Each day she called into the shop, 
When my heart 'gainst.my ribs would go thump; 
When she ask'd me to weigh her a 
chop, 
And some suet, a 
jolly good lump. 
Spoken.—I'd cut her a 
hundred weight of suet and place it by 
tier chops, and think how well we should suit each other, but no, 
she refused me because— 
I'm the mad butcher, &c. 
She smiled on me one afternoon, 
I 
grew hot and cold by degrees; 
I 
told her my love very soon, 
In the sawdust I 
knelt on my knees; 
But she spurn'd me and then what was more, 
I 
know you will say it was too bad, 
She married the tailor next door, 
And ever since then I've been mad. 
Spoken.—Mad! stark, staring mad I She married the ninth 
part of a 
man! a 
tailor! 
in preference to me, but I 
had re-
venge—he took her abroad to Highbury, and there she got pos-
session of all his hard-earu'd savings, and she lavished it away 
upon dress, she bought a 
chignon and she practiced the Grecian 
Bend, and then she paid a 
lot of little boys to say— 
He's the mad butcher, &e. 
One day I'd a 
furious shock, 
I 
hack'd and chopped up the meat; 
At one blow I 
sever'd the block, 
And I 
pitched the sheep's heads in the street; 
By turns I 
now laugh and then cry, 
But.somehow I've lost all my trade: 
I 
cry, buy, buy, the, buy, buy, buy, buy, 
But my customers all seem afraid. 
Spoken.—Yes, and I'm as quiet as a 
lamb, I 
wouldn't hurt a 
worm, but they come round the shop and pick up the block orna-
ments, then look up to know the price; directly they see me they 
remain silent, not a 
word, but I 
can read their thoughts, that— 
I'm the mad butcher, &c.

I 
went there dresed in all my best, 
As f,lks are hound to do ; 
A bright blue exit, an orange vest, 
And rose of crimson hue; 
My income isn't large, you know, 
So at the fair I'd none to spare; 
But still I 
got on nice], till 
I

Spoken.—Yes, there was the dear girl— 
Cuoncs.—My Nancy fair, Jz.c. 
I 
loved my Nancy more than life, 
But if she'd loved me too, 
To ruin me at fancy fairs 
Was not the thing to do; 
She made me purchase at her stall 
A guinea doll, a 
parasol, 
And wooden parrot that you squeezed 
To croak out " Pretty poll." 
Cnoucs.—My Nancy fair, (ke. 
She talked about the naked .blacks, 
And infant nigger boys, 
And how they ran about the streets 
Without their corderoys; 
But when she'd cleared my pockets out, 
With face of gloom I 
heard my doom; 
She said quite fiercely, " Pray, move on, 
And don't take up the room." 
Spoken.—Didn't I 
bless the horrid little niggers at Carriboo 
Aint there enough blacks in London flying about ? Oh 
Cnonus.—My Nancy fair, &c. 
A ruined man, I 
blessed the blacks, 
And left the -wretched place, 
And never since that chky have I 
Beheld my Nancy's face ; 
Although they call them fancy fairs, 
They're not ideal, but very real; 
Then when you visit fancy fairs, 
Be careful how you deal.

To see her smile, I'd -walk a

think is worse

I 
met a 
most delightful girl, 
Out at a 
ball one night, 
I 
felt my peace of mind was gone, 
When first she came in sight ; 
I 
wanted to be introduced, 
And Brown soon did the job, 
By saying " Miss Jeznizna Green, 
MY 
friend young Richard Cobb." 
I 
said " a 
lovely morning, 
No ? no, I 
don't mean that, 
It's night of course, I'm quite aware, 
But have you seen the cat ? 
[
I'm nervous, &c.] 
No doubt she thought it very strarge, 
That I 
should talk ,tusli stuff, 
And as I 
stood, I 
felt that she, 
Must think toe quite a 
muff: 
I 
did not mend the matter much, 
When I 
turned round to say, 
" 
There's been a 
deal of weather, Miss, 
About the town to- day ;" 
And having made that sage remark, 
I 
sat down in a 
chair, 
Plump into Mrs. Johnson's lap, 
Whom I 
did not see there. 
" 
I 
beg a 
thou -
sand pardons" now 
I 
said to 'Airs. J. 
'Who only muttered some such word, 
As ' fool" and turn'd away; 
I 
felt so flurried and confused, 
I 
turned too quickly round,

But what was my dz

-To find the waiter stood behind, 
And I'd upset his tray.

I 
siid " Miss Green will you oblige 
Me with the next Quadrille ? 
As Waltzes—Polkas, I 
can't do, 
They always make me ill." 
But lor ! I 
,could not dance at all, 
They pull'd me here and there, 
My foot caught in 3entima's dress, 
And that began to tear ; 
Ile trimming twisted round my legs, 
In such an awful way, 
'That half a 
dozen soon went down, 
And 1 
among them lay.

I 
rush d 
down stairs to leave the house, 
A 
hat and coat I 
took, 
And not ' till I 
was nearly home, 
Did I 
once at them look: 
.But who can tell the shock I 
felt, 
When on the hat I 
found, 
A servant's black cockade was there, 
And gold lace band Ahl round; 
'The coat was green and trimm'd with red 
And liv'ry buttons bright, 
In fact it was the servant's coat 
And hat I 
took that night.

I 
took them back and got my own, 
And 'ere I 
left the-door, 
There came fr z,m out the drawing room, 
Of Iwo:liter quite a 
roar ; 
They put me down as " fool'. of course, 
And dear Miss Green, no doubt, 
Thought me the greatest " spoon" that she 
I 
lad ever met when out ; 
I 
lost the girl T 
doat upon, 
And made myself-a

Because my nerves won't. let me keep,

MR. SPRIGGS, THE GROCER.—[ConumED.1 
Missus Spriggs gave parties to tea and to dinner, 
And play'd guinea whist, tho' she ne'er was a 
winner; 
Poor Mr. Spriggs! 
She lov'd silver, muslin, French lace, and rich stuffs, 
Pelisses and tippets, and chinchili muffs; 
And some say she lov'd Captain Brown of the Buffs. 
Poor Mr. Spriggs; 
Oh! poor Mr. Spriggs. 
Mr. Spriggs and his wife fell out one night, 
And she vow'd she'd drown herself out of mere spite 
To poor Mr. Spriggs; 
She ran to the river, but when she walked in, 
Her courage grew cold as the wave touch'd her chin, 
And drowning herself she thought was a 
sin. 
Poor Mr. Spriggs; 
Oh 1 
poor Mr. Spriggs. 
A 
fisherman saw her, and thought she'd be wet, 
• 
So he pulled Sally out by a 
cast of his net; 
Poor Mr. Spriggs! 
Took her home, half-drowned, to her anxious dear, 
Who cried when he saw her, she was looking so queer: 
"Pray, sir, why the devil did you interfere 
With poor Mrs. Spriggs 1" 
Oh! poor Mr. Spriggs 1

Can we prevent it's flying?

We'll strew the way with flowers,

This familee, from (lay to day, 
Like hermits, pass'd the time away; 
They look'd such grim and grizzly frights,. 
With faces long as farthing kites ; 
They never did attempt a 
joke, 
And to each other seldom spoke, 
And each one suffeed, so they say, 
From melancholomania.—Cnouts. 
(1) 
A NORRI-BULL TALE.—[CoNcLunEn.) 
They never let no daylight in 
Their dwelling, which you'll say's a 
sin, 
But just like mice they stalk'd about, 
And never show'd their noses Out; 
'This miserable doleful lot, 
From wuss to wusser daily got, 
Until at last a 
form they plann'd, 
They each should die by their own hand.—Cnonus. 
The father into the garden did stroll, 
And blow'd out his brains with a 
sausage roll; 
The mother, seeing what he'd done, 
Stabb'd herself with a 
currant bun; 
Soon arter which the oldest boy 
Shot himself with a 
saveloy; 
The youngest daughter, Mary Ann, 
Garotted herself with the fryiug-pan.—Ctroauss 
The little boy, just turned six, 
Swallow'd a 
gross of flawkrs bricks; 
John with his life did make away, 
By shooting himself with an old tea-tray; 
The melaneholy-visaged groom 
Run himself through with the stable-broom; 
The housemaid into the house did rush, 
And cut her throat with a 
blacking-brIsh.—Cno. 
The infant child, just turned two, 
Drowned himself in an Irish stew; 
But one was left, and he, a-lack 
hung himself with the roasting-
jack; 
The black and white poor tabby-cat, 
Ohok'd herself with the street-door ttre,:„ 
And a 
fly upon the window pane 
Died of water on the brain.—Cnomaik. 
MORAL. 
Now here's a 
moral, don't give way 
To fits of Itypocondria; 
Remember life is but a 
span, 
And live as jolly as you can; 
For ain't it now a 
norribull tale, 
I 
see it's made you all turn pale, 
You're frighten'd into fits I 
see, 
Tweedle, twaddle, tweedle twee.—Cnoaug.

FOLLY CROW.—{GJNOLLIDVD.) 
As on we both did jog, I 
admired the little dog, 
And asked about its mother and its age; 
She said 'twas three months old, and also I 
was told 
That at home she had a 
parrot in a 
cage. 
I 
begg'd that I 
might call just to see her pretty Poll, 
She said, ' 0 yes, with pleasure, that I 
might;" 
She then came to a 
stop, just before a 
chandler's shop, 
And ask'd me in; I 
follow'cl with delight. —Clio. 
Her mother she sold candles, mix'd pickles, and broom handles, 
Red herrings, sugar, mustard, snuff, and tea, 
Firewood, soap, and cheese, hair oil, and split peas, 
And a 
jolly fat old body, too, was she. 
With Polly out I'd roam, or make myself at home, 
In the little snug back parlor (well I 
know), 
And one day to Mrs. C—, 
o'er a 
cup of strong Bollea, 
I 
promised that I'd marry Polly Crow.— Cno. 
• Now every afternoon a 
felloved play a 
tune 
On a 
dilapidated old banjo, 
He'd stand in the gutter, where he used to strum and splutizr; 
The boys they called him Burnt Cork Joe. 
Sometimes he'd try to sing, or do a 
solo on one string. 
Then he'd go round with his cap when he'd done; 
The folks he used to tell that he was a 
noble swell, 
And only played the banjo just for fun.—Cno. 
He'd heave tremendous sighs, show the whites of his eye; 
And one day he told Polly at the door, 
That if with him she'd roam, he'd offer her a 
home, 
And he'd never play the banjo any more. 
His father was a 
nobleman, and when the old chap died, 
he'd then have land and riches in galore; 
So simple-minded Polly agreed to be his bride, 
And off she went, and never came back more.—Cno. 
When her mammy found next day her child had gone away, 
She put the shutters up, and closed the door, 
She tore her old gray hairs, and rushing up the stairs, 
Committed suicide upon the second floor. 
Now Polly may be seen with a 
greasy tambourine, 
And with scarce a 
bit of leather to her feet, 
can but have pity on her, Atou'A a 
black prima donna 
To a 
baud of dirty niggers' 
the street.— CHo.

ALWAYS DO TO OTHERS.—[CoNcLunzn.] 
Perhaps in business you've been wronged 
By some " defaulting rogue," 
For by such scamps the world is thronged, 
They long have been in vogue; 
Don't seek revenge on such a 
wretch, 
But to forgive him try, 
And thus you " do to others, as 
You'd wish to be done by." 
CLIORUS.—Then " 
bear good will to all men," 
It's easy if you'll try, 
And " always do to others as 
You'd wish to be done by." 
If you are rich, and some " old friend" 
Is " down at heel" and poor, 
Well, let the bar of station bend, 
And " open wide your door" 
To welcome him, as you were wont 
"In better days gone by," 
And thus you do to him, poor man, 
As " you'd wish to be done by." 
CII0B.US.—Then " bear good will to all 
It's easy if you try, 
And " always do to others as 
You'd wish to be done by." 
I 
think by what I've said or sung, 
In this my song to-night, 
That I 
have proved to every one 
The glorious might of right. 
So let us all make this resolve, 
And keep it till we die, 
That is to " do to others as 
We'd wish to be done by." 
Cnoans.—Then " bear good will to all men," 
It's easy if you'll try, 
And " always do to others as 
We'd wish to be done by."

*AM: 
KILL OR CURE. 
I'm a 
roving Irish boy, I 
was born in Ballaragban, 
And christened with much joy, after my father, Patrick Faghan; 
I 
had a 
sweetheart Kitty, and I 
courted her so gaily, 
Devil a 
thought had I 
of trouble, as I 
twisted my shelalagh. 
CHORES. 
Musha, Kitty O'Shaughnessy, she's the girl for me, 
Whack fal do daddy, musha O'Shaughnessy. 
Och, ' twas herself I 
courted, a 
girl so neat and cosy, 
She said she loved me in return— her cheeks were red and rosy; 
Of sovereigns I 
had twenty, says she, I've seventeen, 
Faith, well join ourselves and them together, and live like king 
and queen. 
Musha, & c. 
So we both set sail for Liverpool, and packed our _ kits together, 
And married got so neat and cool, in spite of wind and weather; 
With our money we opened a 
shop, in business not amiss, 
We sold oysters, haddocks, mac'ral, mussels, praties, and fried 
fish. 
Musha, & c. 
In business we did well, till one day she was taken ill, sirs, 
And the doctor almost ruined me by sending in his bill, sirs; 
So I 
made a 
bargain with him, " kill or cure," for twenty pounds 
so frisky, 
He was a 
dacent sort, so I 
thought I'd stand a 
noggin of Irish 
whiskey. 
Musha, & c. 
But she grew worse and worse, which made me quake with fear, 
sir, 
The doctor he attended her for more than half a 
year, sir ; 
Till one fine morn she died, and myself ic did bewilder, 
And the doctor he wanted his twenty pounds, ( spoken) says 
I, von never cured her! 
No, says he—then says I, ( singing) you dare not say you 
killed her ! 
Musha, & c. 
So gentlemen enjoy themselves, the whiskey drink like thunder, 
You cannot help but own yourselves, there's mirth in an Irish 
blunder; 
But when for your wives a 
doctor you want, mind and yer be sure, 
Make the bargain as I 
did myself, wid the doctor, " kill or cure.'

I 
SHOULD LIKE TO BE A FAIRY .—[CONCLUDED:1 
If I 
had fairy wings, you know, 
I'd tease out of their lives 
Old bachelors, and flirting men, 
Who won't make girls their wives; 
I'd hover round their haunts, and show 
The joy a 
wedding brings, 
And try to touch their stony hearts 
With Cupid's fairy wings. 
Cnoaus.—I should like to be a 
fairy, 
So graceful, light, and airy ; 
How nice to be a 
fairy with 
A 
pair of paper wings. 
I'd try to show the wealthy few, 
The good they might insure, 
With fliry wings of golden hue, 
Amidst our starving poor; 
I'd teach them in sumptuous homes, 
That poverty oft brings 
The poor to lose it's honesty 
Through want of golden wings. 
Caonus.—I should like to be a 
fairy, 
So graceful, light, and airy ; 
How nice to be a 
fairy with 
A 
pair of paper wings. 
We've all our different fancies, let 
Them be whate'er they may, 
If we wish to do the heavy, why 
Then for it we must pay; 
So, when upon the " fly," my boys, 
Your sprees and little flings, 
Just bear in mind that bank notes make 
The best of paper wings. 
Cnosus.—I should like to be a 
fairy, 
So graceful, light, and airy; 
How nice to be a 
fairy with 
A

THE IRISH MULE-DRIVER.-[CoNcLuDED.} 
To atein' and dhrinkin' and sleepin' enough 
'Tis myself was always found partial, 
Bat these things were scarce, while the fightha' was tough, 
From the private up to the tield-marshal; 
'Twas only the doctbors, I 
found, did conthrive 
In the hest of condition to he, sir; 
High and low, right and left, ' twas the word " be alive," 
I: The minnit we saw an M. D., sir. : 1 
M. D. was the signal for clearing the road, 
When the baggage got stuck in some bye-way; 
M. D. had the best of good quarters allow'd, 
And carried all things in his high way. 
While others were starving, M. D. had his feed, 
While others were thirsty he drank full. 
" 
Oh," says I, " sure if Providence decreed 
t: To make me an M. D. I'd be thankful." : 1 
The war being done we were hid to embark, 
The ships tall as ever they'd holud, faith ; 
I 
made on my thrunk in big letthers a 
mark, 
And sthruttod aboord then quite bowld, faith ; 
The lathers I 
put on the box was M. D. 
The miunit the skipper espied it : 
" 
Of course the best cabin for you, sir," says he; 
E: I 
nodded and never denied it. : I 
▪ 
We sailed in the night, and ' twas all right and tight 
While darknes and silence surrounded, 
But in daylight and spakin', while breakfast was =kin', 
I 
feared that I 
might be confounded. 
Some officers look'd at me. sour as a 
lime, 
With suspicion, or something akin to it, 
But I 
never open'd my mouth all the time, 
r: Unless ' twas to put something into it. : 1 
With the best of good living and jolly (good berth, 
The days flew away to my liking, 
I 
ate, drank and smok'd like a 
lord of the earth, 
Throughout every bell that was rtrihing. 
With a 
book in my hand I 
would hod when they spoke, 
As it' study with me was the main thrick. 
So at last thro' the ship it was passed as a. joke, 
- 
That the M. B. was rather ecceuthric."1 
But, as had luck would have it, a 
fayver broke out, 
And they call'd upon me for to cure it. 
" 
In fayver," says I, " there is always great doubt, 
And the life of a 
man who can insure it ? 
I'll give up to none in the dhrivin' of mules, 
And they're obstinate bastes to be sure, sirs ; 
But I 
can't dhrive a 
fayver, so don't be such fools 
' E: As be axin' of me for a 
cure, sirs." 
" 
Then a'nt you a 
docthor ?" they all of them cried. 
" 
The dickins a 
docthor am I. dear." 
" 
Then why on your luggage M. D. have we spied ?" 
" 
Because ' tis my right to apply, dear." 
"M. P. manes a 
docthor," they joined in one cry, 
" 
Or titles are not worth a 
stiver." 
" 
If M. D.'s the sign of a 
docthor." says 
1" It stands quite as well for Mule-Driver." : 1

MY MOTHER-IN-LAW. 
I 
said on the morning I 
married, 
'Tis the happiest, day of my life, 
As down sunny Broadway I 
hurried, 
With my beautiful dutiful wife. 
E , ch 
day will but add to tny pleasure, 
Along with the one I 
adore, 
But I 
soon discovered the plague of my life, 
It was not my friends, my servants or wife, 
But my fussy old mother-in-law, the bore, 
My fussy old motherin-law. 
The honeymoon over, returning 
To town with toy dear little bride, 
The care of the world I 
was spurning, 
As we sat by our own fireside. 
Said she, to my side drawing nearer, 
As servants they are such a 
bore, 
And mother's a 
‘N idow and lonely, dear, 
We cannot do better than send for her here, 
I 
answered her, yes, to be sure—oh, Lot', 
Anil I 
sent for my mother-in-law, 
One morning, in desperate hurry, 
A 
call it. drove up to my door, 
Containing six boxes, a 
bundle, 
Two trunks and may mother-in-law. 
Down the steps, in a 
terrible flurry, 
To meet my wife's parent I 
tore, 
Saying. Welcome, dear madam, pray step this way, 
I 
'iii really delighted to meet you to-day, 
As I 
handed in mother-in-law, the bore, 
My respectable mother-in-law. 
My life up to this was delicious, 
I 
n,iver 1141 cause for a 
frown, 
But Maini»a was so very officious, 
My house it was turned up-side down, 
Tile way she upset all toy customs, 
[
1] 
MY MOTHER-IN-LAW. [coNcLuDED.] 
I 
very soon voted a 
bore, 
She worried and skurried me out of my life, 
.1 began to imagine, instead of my wife, 
I 
bad married my mother in-law, 
Officious old mother-in-law. 
„ca. 
In my house I 
was not my own master, 
Each day we'd a 
family jar, 
My wife couldn't expend it dollar, 
Without asking Darling Mamma. 
Mamma can do this, and Mamma can do that. 
At length very plainly I 
saw, 
If I 
wished to be happy and pass my life, 
Quite free front matrimonial strife, 
I 
must part with my mother-in-law, the bore, 
Interfering old mother-in-law. 
She told me so rudely one morning, 
I 
hadn't the least cumnion sense, 
Su it seems, my dear mother, I 
answered, 
With ycur presence I 
now can dispense. 
So pack up your luggage, and off you 
go, 
I've had quite enough of your jaw, 
I'm determined no longer you stay with me. 
She departed that morning and left me free, 
Of my fussy old mother-in-law, the bore, 
Disagreeable old mother-in-law. 
A moral my song is adorning, 
To persons about to be wed, 
Will serve as an excellent warning, 
Remembering- all I 
have sad, 
Relations are always best, apart, 
Is a 
saving you've herd once before, 
In two there is company, three there is none, 
Be certain your every comfort is gone, 
if you live with a 
mother-in-law, be sure. 
I FANCY I CAN SEE FIER NOW.

And said, in voice so sweet, 
You wear this for my sake, dear Joe," 
As she placed it on my feet. 
Spoken—My head I 
mean.—I'm thinkin' so much o' her, I 
don't 
know what I 
say.—Cnonus. 
The lovely bread she used to bake, 
The scones and pancakes too; 
And Everton Toffy she could make 
As sticky and thick as glue. 
I'd back her, too, agin the world, 
Liver and bacon to fry, 
When think o' the watery 'taters too, 
The steam comes from my eye. 
Spoken—I 
mean, when I 
think o' the steaming 'taters the water 
comes frae my eye, darned if I 
know what I'm sayin', thinkin' o' 
that lass.—Citonus. 
I 
bought her, once, a 
splendid dress, 
That cost me many a 
groat; 
To show ye how she loved me, now, 
I'll tell a 
nannygoat :—(anecdote.) 
She saved a 
great lump of her dress, 
This is a 
truth, I 
vow, 
And made me this fine waistcoat, 
That ye see me srearin' now. 
Spoken—Look at that!—there's a 
fit,—the Prince o' Wales' 
tailor couldn't mak' better nor that—no fear o' it splittin'—plenty 
o' room to grow,—ah she wor a 
good lass, she'd do onything 
tell her without me kickin' her. 
She wor dairy-maid wi' Farmer 
Fen, I 
used to work at plough,—then we used to romp when work 
wor done—I 
used to pinch her arm as hard as I 
could till she 
cried, and she used to hit I 
on the head wi' the spakle,—what 
fun we had.— Ctionus. 
It's no use me a-standin' here, 
I'm wastin' all my time; 
But to meet my Bet again, 
The highest mountains I 
would climb; 
If I 
can't see nowt on her here, 
Frae Lunnon 
retire, 
And weepin' for my Betsy Gray, 
Go back the Lancashire.—ermans„.

As I 
looked around me und saw no one was near, 
I 
tought I 
would make love on her, if der coast vas glear, 
I 
quietly walked up to her and called her pretty dear, 
She came und sat beside of me und drinked a 
glass of beer ; 
In her ways of feeling she soon won my heart, 
On her I 
spent my money rind swore we'd never part, 
Still we kept on drinking, drinking mit our might 
Till dot lager beer commenced to tell, und den we both got tight.

The aim of the author ef "DE 
W ITT'S CONNECTICUT COOK BOOK " has 
been to strip the art of cooking of all useless preparations, and all the un-
meaning jargon of the cuisine; and to write in a 
plain, common-sense way, 
giving only thrections that have been tried and not found wanting. 
Every 
mode of Cooking and Preserving described in these hares are the results of 
actual personal experience; and have never failed to produce the best tasting 
as well as the best looking dishes that can be placed on the table. 
Let any 
housewife follow the directions, and our word for it: Good digestion will 
surely " wait on appetite."
