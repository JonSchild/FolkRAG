for Joan Naviyuk Kane. 
 
[Carrie Ayagaduk Ojanen reads "Tiimiaq, something carried,"] 
 
CAO:  Unga Ayagaduk. I am Ayagaduk. My name is Carrie Ayagaduk Ojanen. Ayagaduk is the 
name my aapa gave me. My mom said when I was born my aapa looked at me and said, 
“Ayagaduk, at last you came back!” I was named for his favorite grandfather. My aaka and 
aapa, Cecilia and Edward Muktoyuk, Sr., were fluent Inupiaq speakers of the Ugiuvamiut 
dialect. We are Ugiuvamiut, King Islanders. Ugiuvamiut from Ugiuvak, King Island, a rocky island 
60 miles off the coast of the Seward Peninsula in Alaska in the abundant waters of the Bering 
Sea.   
 
My mom, Ruth Ayagiaq Ojanen, too, was a fluent speaker of Inupiaq as a girl. When the BIA 
closed the school on King Island in the 60s and wouldn’t send another teacher, the King 
Islanders were forced to relocate to Nome and beyond to meet federal education requirements 
for their children. She forgot how to speak Inupiaq in the all-English public school in Nome. She 
had to ask a friend to teach her as a teenager.   
 
It is a painful loss to lose one’s language. It hurts everyone: parent, child, grandchildren. I was 
an English and French double major in college. Learning French from books and in classes made 
me more confident to try to learn Inupiaq from books and to try to teach my children what I 
learn. It’s not easy. The dictionary I have is not published, it’s a copy of the book draft. It’s easy 
to get discouraged. But watching my bright and eager children, I feel hope that the efforts I 
make will take root. 
 
I dedicated this poem to Joan Naviyuk Kane. I never thought I would make it to King Island in 
this lifetime. But she raised funds and chartered a fishing vessel and invited me along. Along 
with Bernadette Alvanna-Stimpfle and Marilyn Koezuna-Irelan, both deeply involved in Inupiaq 
language and cultural preservation and teaching. Seeing our home island, climbing its steep 
cliffside, standing beside my grandparents' small home made me realize it’s still there. It’s still 
there. We can go back. The puffin, murre, and kittiwake are still there. We are still here. And we 
can be reunited. We Ugiuvamiut and our Ugiuvak. It draws us home. Perhaps someday my 
children or their children or their children’s children will again live in its abundant embrace.  
 
I am indebted in my poetry to the dedicated dancers, singers, carvers, beautiful and functional 
garment makers, artists, story tellers, poets, and linguists, of my people. I am one of many and 
indebted to them all.
