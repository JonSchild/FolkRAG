Last night I 
dreamed, 
What could it mean, 
I 
was your heart's love, 
You were my queen, 
And thus I 
came, 
And thus I 
knelt; 
Dare I 
repeat to you 
All that I 
felt ? 
Start not my darling 
If wild my word seem, 
'Twas out a 
dream, love, 
Only a 
dream. 
Last night I 
dreamed, 
0, were it true I 
I 
was your lover, 
Mine sweet were you. 
On your dear lips 
Kisses I 
prest, 
Drew you all willingly 
Close to my breast. 
Start r 
ot my darling, 
Tho' wild my vi ords seem, 
'Twas but a 
drcapn,.love, 
Only a 
dream.

Am.—" Perhaps She's On The Railway." 
I've lost my love, my turtle dove, 
She's gone across the seas, 
My heart is cracked and swollen up 
And full of bumble bees; 
Oh, with a 
chinaman she flew 
And gone I 
don't know where, 
And every corner of the street 
I 
stand. watching for her. 
Spok.en.—But its no use, wherever I 
go and stand watch-
ing and waiting for her, some policeman is bound to tell 
me to " Move on, go on," and when I 
ask whither I 
shall 
go, they say— 
CHORUS. 
Go on and take the railway, 
Go and travel West, 
Go on and see your grandma, 
Go pull down your vest, 
Go anywhere, go everywhere, 
Don't be loafing here 
Or you will get a 
head put on 
And waltzed oil on your ear. 
She used to read those story books 
About that " Wife of Mine," 
And sing the songs " They all do it" 
And " Pulling down the blind," 
At all theatres she would go, 
No matter what I'd say 
When " Romeo and Juliet" 
Was on the bill to play. 
Spoken. — That's what comes of taking your girl to see 
the play—she'll fall in love with some Montague or song 
and dance man and then she will shake you and tell you 
to--
(Chorus). 
I've got myself into a 
scrape, 
I'm full of dread and fear 
That every moment I 
will see 
Policemen coming here, 
To lug me to the station house 
For knocking some one down 
And putting a 
head upon a 
chap 
Who told me to go on. 
Spoken. — Yes, in my rage 
ve Knocked somebody down 
for being told to go on, but if I 
had come here I might 
have found my girl. 
Yes. you can always find somebody's 
girl here. 
Here's where everybody comes to enjoy them-
selves, and you are not told to—

tell you what everything is made of, 
Made of, made of, made of, - 
By your faces you show that you're anxious to know, 
So I'll tell you what everything is made of, 
When you do know what everything is made of, 
Made of, made of, made of, 
A 
look of surprise will open your eyes 
When I've told you what everything is made of. 
CHORUS. . 
Listen to me and don't think me too free, 
Of what everything is made at once I 
can see, 
So for a 
few moments just listen to me 
And I'll tell you what everything is made of. 
What is our city made,of—railroads, gin mills, taxes, 
That never relaxes and almost distract us, 
For the next hundred years it will be so, 
What are our politicians made of—strikers, fighters; 
highsters, 
That promise everything ' till an office they get in, 
Then go back on the boys and don't know them. 
(Chorus). 
What are our babies made of—squalls, brawls, crawls, 
Never any bother, a 
blessing to a 
father, 
And every mother thinks hers the prettiest, 
What is whiskey made of—benzine, six months, Jim 
jams, 
That makes you walk so crooked your sorry that you 
took it, 
And you fall in a 
sewer and get drowned. 
(Chorus). 
What are policemen made of—good men, dead beats, 
' 
bummers, ,"+ ° • .„ 
In unifdrin so pretty, seldom seen on duty, 
And when there is a 
fight you can't find them. 
What is the tombs made of—shysters, judges, 
prisoners 
And innocent people, all locked up for nothing, 
And thos-
e" without money can stag there. 
(Chorus). 
What are women made of—tongues, of jaw, and more, 
The greatest of blessings the world ever sent us 
And never could live now without them, 
What are our men made of—bread-winners, sinners, 
ginners, 
Who can tame more bourbon and lick any country 
Anywhere on the face of the globe, 0. 
(Chorus). 
What is our hash made of—everything, anything, many 
things, 
Old umbrellas, segars and shirt collars, 
Any boarding house keeper can prove it, 
What is the world made of—dollars, horrors, bothers, 
That will trouble and torture ' till you live as you ought to 
And stay home 
night with your wives, 0. 
(Chorus). 
What am I 
made of—segars, old hats, lager, 
But always am willing with my 
jokes and my singing 
To make you feel like a 
gay morning star, 0, 
What is this audience made of—ladies, gentlemen, 
children, 
Honest hard working men, always ready to defend 
Our homes, our rights and our country. 
(Chorus).

PARODY. 
Written by SAUL SERTREDV. 
AIR.—" Must We Then Meet as Strangers." 
Must we then meet as strangers, 
After all our rows 
And fights we've had together 
And many hard struck blows, 
Life without them were awful, 
To separate from thee, 
No more to fight or quarrel, 
Would be the death of me. 
Crioitus. 
Oh, hit me with a 
hammer, 
Do anything that's mean, 
Don't let us meet as strangers, 
My darling Imogene. 
How oft your smiles and glances 
Have given me the cramps, 
How oft when playing " poker" 
You've won from me my stamps, 
3Iust we then stop our fighting 
Because I 
struck you foul, 
And always keep your back up 
And never have a 
growl. 
I'll love you in the.morninf,r, 
I'll love you noon and night, 
love you all my life time 
And never quit your sight, 
I'll fire you out the window, 
I'll pitch you down the stairs 
If you don't stop your 
kicking" 
And putting on your airs.

That's all very & ce but I 
think you will agree 
If they'd make it right away how much better it would be, 
Oh, the sweet right away, Oh, ,he sweet right away, 
That's the song now to sing and the motto for the day, 
For life is but fleeting we haven't long to stay. 
Let our joys then by shining in the sweet right away. 
In the sweet by and bye. Oh, they promise everything, 
And the days they are passing, but aothing do they bring 
Oh, the " proof of the pudding" is in eating it they say, 
If that good time is coming let it comc right away, 
Oh, the sweet right away, ./ h, tne sweet right away, 
That's the style all the while and the motto for the clay, 
For life is but fleeting, we haven't long to stay, 
Let our joys then be shining in the swe right away : 
There's Tweed he is waiting

Oh, it's jolly to have money, 
Everybody should,

Everybody would;

From poverty secure. 
In times like these when you're at ease, 
Oh, don't forget the poor. 
Ye that's happy and have plenty,

MY NIGHT OFF, 
Written by SArt, SEBTREW. 
Ain.—"Immensicoff" 
Some like to stroll in Central Park 
To pass the time away, 
Some like to promenading go 
To see the styles so gay, 
And some at home the time employ 
And never venture forth, 
But I'm the boy that's full of joy 
When I 
have my night off. 
Spoken. — Yes, with a 
five cent shine upon my shoes, a 
dollar or two in my pocket, I'm just about as happy as 
they make 'em, when my work is done and I 
have the 
pleasure of being informed that— 
("flours. 
It's my night off, 0, my night off, 
I'm always gay on my night off, 
0, that's my style when I 
go forth, 
I'm one of the boys on my night off. 
All dressed up in my pretties now, 
0, I'm a 
happy cove, 
Then off to promenade I 
go 
And take my turtle dove, 
The peanut stands we patronize, 
And then to be immense, 
We walk up by Delmonico's 
Regardless of expense. 
13 
Spoken. — Yes, I 
always feel so happy when I am out 
with my sweet girl, Amelia. 
There's nothing mean about 
me. I 
bought her ten cents worth of chestnuts the other 
night and gave a 
bootblack $2 
to carry them home for her 
and she said " Why, Montague, how reckless you are with 
your wealth." I 
says, well you know my darling— 
(Chorus). 
My love is such a 
charming girl 
I 
takes her everywheres, 
She isn't pretty, but she's good, 
And never puts on airs, 
Instead of spending money now 
To make a 
show and dress, 
She goes around among the poor 
Relieving their distress. 
Spoken. — Yes, and she's got such a 
nice way of coming 
around you and making you do just what she says, and 
the other night while walking out she seemed so very 
happy I 
asked her what made her so jubilant, she says : 
"I gave a 
poor man something to eat to-day and if you 
could have seen how he enjoyed the food and how the big 
tears rolled down his cheeks when he thanked me, and— 
and—and—there's a 
poor woman with six children that 
lives around the corner and they haven't got anything to 
eat in the house, and I know where there's two little 
orphans ain't got no shoes to wear and it's awful cold 
weather," and then she commences to blubber and says 
[Mr NIGIIT Orr.—Continued.] 
it's awful, and I 
blubber and say its dreadful, and then I 
hand her my pocket book and then she smiles and then I 
smile, and we both feel so happy that we scream right 
out with joy, and somebody-asks me why I 
am so happy 
and I 
tell them. 
(Chorus). 
The other night I 
met some friends, 
Old times we did recall, 
And sung- and danced the whole night long, 
'Till sleep came over all. 
I 
dream't the good old times had come 
Once more with us to dwell, 
But when I 
woke up in the morn 
I 
found my dream a cell." 
Spoken. — Yes, I 
was sold, my dream ended in a " cell," 
four by two. I 
was then brought before a Judge and 
asked if I 
had anything to say why I 
shouldn't get six 
months for disturbing the peace by singing " The Star 
Bangled Spanner, - and in answer to his ' terogatives I 
remarked that it— 
(Chorus). 
It was meet in early childhood, 
To be rocked and hushed, " hushoe 
When an infant, screaming wild, would 
Soon fall sleeping, and lay low, 
But ' twas on a 
Mother's bosom, 
Softly, sweetly lulled to rest. 
Different, far, the raging Ocean— 
Cold and cheerlegs is its breast. 
But our Saviour—Great Omnipotent I 
Knoweth best the way to plan. 
On the Mother's breast the infant--
On the Ocean's breast the man. 
Daring hearts are those who venture 
O'er the wild and treacherous Sea. 
Faithful hearts are those who rest sure 
In God's guidance, safe to be. 
Even here, sweet thoughts remind us 
Of old friends and kindred dear; 
While we east a 
look behind us, 
Gushes forth a 
kindly tear. 
We may never reach old "England, 
Still, we hold bright hope in store. 
Angels guide us to the end, and 
We may reach a 
better shore.

COMING FROM THE MATINEE, 
THE BLUEJAY IS SINGING. 
Written by SAUL SERIIIEw. 
'Twas coming from the matinee, 
A 
damsel I 
did meet, 
The glances that she threw on me 
Just took me off my feet, 
I 
soon made overtures of love 
And going to the car 
I 
asked her if she would wed with me, 
She said go ask my pa. 
CHORUS. 
Go ask my pa, go ask my pa, 
And if he says I 
may, 
I'll let you know when next we meet' 
Coming from the matinee. 
I'll call upon her upon ancient dad 
And state the case to him, 
Though he may frown and gaze on me 
With gestures fierce and grim, 
I 
flatter with my style and shape 
His favor I 
will win, 
And when his daughter i 
have wed, 
0, won't I 
spend his " tin." 
As sung by the World's Greatest Song and Dance Artists,

Oh! de lamb, de Bluejay's singing, 
For his true love in de clouds. 
Nebecodnazer am de King, 
El;jar am de Prophet; 
He flew straight up to glory 
Upon a 
big sky rocket. 
CHORUS. 
But wait awhile, my lovely dears, 
The breeze is getting stronger ; 
On a 
summer day he'll come again, 
Then we will wait no longer. 
Solo] 
We'll raise our voices to de skies. 
Chorus] 
Oh! de lamb, de Bluejay's singing. 
And fly away like butterflies. 
Choras] 
Oh! de lamb, de Bluejay's singing, 
For his true love in de clouds. 
We'll fly away to Jericho, 
Put wittles in your pocket; 
The road is long, but we'll get there, 
With Elijaherara de Prophet.

M4, 
As sung by M ISS JF.NNIE ENGEL.. 
Oh, 
norrible tale I 
have to tell 
Of sad misfortunes which befell 
A 
family that once resided 
Just in the very same thoroughfare as I 
did. 
The pa-ri-ent was so grim a 
guffin, 
lie never liked no fun nor nutlin; 
In fact, he never made the least endeavour 
To be facetious notsumnever. 
CHORUS. 
For oh, it is such a 
norrible tale ! 
'Twill make your faces all turn pale! ! 
Your eyes with grief quite overcome ! ! ! 
Twiddle, twaddle, twydle, twaddle, twain it 
Though a 
very respectable family 
They never saw no company; 
And every boy and every gal 
Grew hy-po-chon-der-i-a-cal. 
They fancied they had all sorts of sorrors 
And conjured up all kinds of horrors. 
Till each, with a 
face as long as a 
ladder 
Turned pale as a 
sheet if they saw their own shadder. 
For oh, ,kc 
They sat with the curtains drawn down tight. 
On purpose to keep out the light; 
And the father, the mother, the sister, nor l'nk: urother, 
Never spoke a 
word to one another. 
At last this doleful, dismal lot, 
All so melancholy got, 
That an end to themselves they did agree 
To put, when they'd settled which end it was to be. 
For oh , 
C_ C. 
First, the father into the garden did walk, 
And beheaded himself with a 
toasting fork; 
And the mother an end to herself did pat, 
'Fly Strangling herself with the waterbutt; 
Then the sister went down on her bended knees, 
And drowned herself in toasted cheese; 
Whilst the, brother, a 
most determined young feller, 
Wnnt and poisoned himself with his gingham umbrella. 
For oh, Szt. 
Then the baby in the little cradle 
Shot itself dead with its silver ladle; 
And the servant-girl, seeing what it went and did, 
Smothered herself with the sance-pan lid; 
The miserable cat by the kitchen tire 
Swallowed the poker and did expire: 
And a 
fly on the ceiling—this case was the wust 
Went and ble‘i itself up with spontaneous combustion. 
For oh, S:c. 
Then in there walked the auctioneer, 
Who did with the furniture disappear; 
And the broker's man—mind this arn't no fable— 
Tie made bisself away with the three-legged table. 
When the house saw this its sides it splits, 
The windows went cracked, and broke themselves to bits; 
And the roof got a 
tile off, and so dreadful was this slaugh-
ter-rate, 
That nufiln was left vt last but an unpaid water-rate. 
For oh, &c. 
Now, here's a 
moral, if you choose: ' 
Don't go and give way to the blues., 
Or you might come to those dreadful ends 
Of these my melancholy friends, 
You'll find to laugh whene'er you can 
Is a 
very sensible sort of plan, 
And if from my song a 
laugh you caught of it, 
That Is about the long and the short of it..

Sung with great succes by FRANK BENNETT. 
Come o'er the lake with me, love, 
The moon is shining bright, 
Upon yon mimic sea, love, 
We'll float in her silver light; 
The balmy summer breeze, love, 
Scarce moves the passive tide, 
As it plays among the trees, love, 
That line the water's side. 
CHORUS. 
Come o'er the lake with me, love, 
The moon is shining clear and bright; 
Upon you mimic sea,. love, 
We'll float in her silver light. 
Sweet scents from new mown hay, love, 
Ascend from mead and vale, 
And from the forest gray, love, 
Trills forth the nightingale. 
They've left their gorgeous caves, love, 
Those naiads fair to play, 
On the lightly rippling waves, love, 
Where moonbeams sparkle gay. 
Come o'er the lake, eta.

blessed her tiny fingers while they dabbled in the flour ; 
But when she'd chopped the suet, put the big pot on the grate, 
I 
sung this Christmas carol for I 
could no longer wait. 
Currants and Plums, Ltc. 
My darling little Rosy blush'd a 
rosy, rosy red, 
She left -her Christmas pudding and hung down her pretty 
head; 
Then looking up, she clapped aloft, her floury hands in glee, 
Crying-" Come and see the pudding, love, I've made for you 
and me." 
Currants and Plums, S:c. 
We put the pudding in the pot, and watched it while it boiled ; 
For a 
Christmas pudding left alone's a Christmas pudding 
spoiled ; 
Then side by side before the fire, with many a 
loving kiss, 
We passed the happy hours away, and sung a 
chant like 
this. 
Currants and Plums, &,c. 
Of Christmas puddings in my time, I've tasted many a 
score, 
But I 
never tasted pudding half so good as this before : 
And I've got a 
precious promise, from my darling Rosy May-
To make another pudding on our happy wedding day. 
Currants and Plums, &c.

SPEAK, ONLY SPEAK, 
Sung with great success by the PEASLEYS. 
Why are you silent and sad, love, 
Filling my poor heart with pain ?] 
Lives like your own should be glad, love, 
Smile on me sweetly again; 
Surely I 
never can leave thee, 
Here with those tears on thy cheeks, 
What have I 
done thus to grieve thee ? 
Speak to me, love, only speak, 
CHORUS. 
Speak to me then, only speak, love, 
Why are those tears on thy cheeks, 
Give me the answer I 
seek, love, 
Speak to me, love, only speak. 
Lives like your own cannot live, love, 
Always in sorrow and pain, 
Whisper you gladly forgive, love, 
Kiss and be happy again; 
Cease then your weary repining, 
Banish the tear from thy cheek, 
With my arms round you entwining, 
Speak to me, love, only speak, 
Speak to me, then, etc.

SPARKING SUNDAY NIGHT. 
As Sung by the Foy SISTERS. 
Sitting in a 
corner, on a 
Sunday eve, 
With a 
taper'd finger resting on your sleeve ; 
Starlight eyes are casting on your face their light, 
Bless me, ain't it pleasant, sparking Sunday night! 
How your heart is thumping 'gainst your Sunday vest, 
How wickedly 'tis working on this day of rest ; 
Hours seem but minutes, as they take their flight, 
Bless me, ain't it pleasant, sparking Sunday night. 
Dad and marm are sleeping in their peaceful bed, 
Dreaming of the things the folks in meeting said ; 
" 
Love ye one anofher," ministers recite, 
Bless me, don't we do it—sparking Sunday night! 
One arm with gentle pressure, lingers 'round her waist 
You squeeze her dimpl'd hand her pouting lips you taste 
She freely slaps your face, but more in love than spite. 
Thunder! ain't it pleasant sparking Sunday night! 
But hark ! the clock is striking two o'clobk, I 
snum, 
Sure as I'm a 
sinner, the time to go has come ; 
You ask, in spiteful accents, if that old clock is right, 
And wonder if it ever—sparked on Sunday night. 
One, two, three sweet kisses, four, five, six you hook, 
But thinking that you rob her, put back those you took, 
Then as for home you hurry, from the fair one's sight, 
Don't you wish each day was only Sunday night.

DON'T CATCH A DU
. TTERPLT . 
Never was a 
man without a 
little boy! 
Just try to put the matter in your eye! 
You may not all of you believe the fact, 
But little boys grew bigger bye and bye, 
Roaming in the fields or over in the park, 
Before I 
was too big I 
used to try, 
As quick as any merry lark, 
Or little dog with snappy bark, 
To catch at a 
butterfly. 
CHORUS: 
Oh! now boys and girls beware 
And learn to mind your eye, 
While you are well enough 
Let well enough alone 
And don't catch a 
butterfly. 
When I 
sowed my oats I 
set up for a 
sport! 
And tho't it nice to take a 
drink and try 
To bet my money omi the bobtailed nag," 
But " Mountain Girl " was quicker on the fly; 
So I 
told my "  
Ma " justhow I 
had been hurt, 
Said she to me" my son, oh mind your eye I 
Just every time you will resort 
To bet your money like a 
sport, 
You're after a 
butterfly," 
Chorus. 
Then I 
did resolve to try and be a 
man— 
A 
girl she shot an arrow in my eye; 
My heart went pi-ti-pi- ti- pat and so 
I 
feared, oh, dear! I 
was a 
butterfly! 
"Pretty Mollie Jane," said I, " oh be my Queen!" 
Said she, " I 
will be your3, until I 
die."— 
'Twas walking out upon the green, 
When nothing but the stars were seen, 
I 
caught not a 
butterfly 
Chorus.

FORGOTTEN. 
Duett, Sung by the World's Premier Irish Sketch Artists. 
THE GREAT FIELDDIGS. 
Perhaps you'll remember, dear Mary 
If you listen to me for awhile, 
Some friends that lived in Tipperary, 
In your own little Emerald Isle. 
Now, just think of one out of many— 
Think of him darling, Cushla Machree, 
Who swore he would love you forever, 
And follow you over the Sea! 
Oh ! look at me closely, dear Mary, 
In your heart let me still find a 
place ; 
For although poor and ragged, my Mary, 
You will surely remember my face 
Oh, yes! I 
remember you, Phelim, 
Although you have altered since then; 
When I 
look at your face, it reminds me 
Of my dear Old Ireland again ; 
Where among the green Mountains and Callies, 
So often together we've strayed; 
When you kissed and caressed me so fondly, 
And you called me your dear Irish maid! 
Durrr. 
11E. —I 
see that you know me, dear Mary. 
SuE.—You see that I 
know you, dear Phelim. 
HE. —And you seem to be glad we have met. 
SHE. — And oh! I'm so glad we have met. 
HE.—You've always been true to me, Mary ? 
SB:E. — I've always been true to you, darling! 
HE. — And you have not forgotten me yet? 
Sraz.—And I 
have not forgotten you yet!

LONELY I 
wander, in sadness and pain, 
Longing to look on my dear ones again; 
Clouds of misfortune are over me casts 
Sadly I 
weep when I 
think of the past! 
No glances of pity or kindness I 
see, 
None seem to care for my sorrow or me; 
Lost in the whirl of the city I 
roam, 
Friendless, forsaken, I'm far, far from home. 
CHORUS. 
Houseless and weary, I'm plodding my way, 
Lost among strangers, from day unto day, 
No place of shelter 'neath you cheerless dome, 
Friendless, forsaken, I'm far, far from home. 
Once I 
was happy, and loved ones were near, 
Friends and companions were gentle and dear! 
Still I 
remember my mother's delight, 
Clasp'd in her arms while she bade me " good night,", 
Cold are the faces that now pass me by, 
What is there left for me now but to die ? 
Lost in the whirl of the city I 
roam, 
Hopeless and helpless, I'm far, far from home. 
Houseless and weary, ttc. 
Bright are the homes that I 
see on each side, 
Yansions of wealth, and of love and of pride; 
Once I'd a 
home just as bright and as fair, 
Loved ones and dear ones to welcome me there! 
Father of all, in thy; pity look down, 
Help me, tho' darkly the tempest may frown; 
Watch o'er my footsteps while sadly I 
roam, 
Save thy poor wand'rer, so far, far from home. 
Homeless and weary, ttc. 
Vr: 
Don't laugh—this ain't a 
comic song, 
But a 
story full of truth, 
And now, before you, you behold 
An infatuated youth. 
One evening, just like one of you, 
In a 
theatre I 
sat, 
And I 
met going out I 
tell you true, 
A 
girl with a 
broad- brimmed hat. 
I 
helped her passing through the crowd, 
She gently squeezed my arm, 
To ask her then to have ice cream 
I 
thought ' twould be no harm. 
We creamed, she told me that her pa 
Was worth a 
million tlat; 
Then I 
pitched in strong, a- making love 
To the girl with the broad- brimmed hat. 
We'd not been long together, 
When a 
stranger happened in, 
He spoke—she introduced him 
As her gallant " Cousin Jim." 
He's related to the President, 
And I 
must tell you that 
He's a 
postmaster away out West, 
Says the girl with the broad- brimmed hat. 
Her " cousin" ordered wine at once, 
To which / did not say nay, 
Until he handed me the bill, 
Which of course I 
had to pay. 
But when the waiter winked at me, 
As if .saying " You're a 
flat :" 
I 
kind of got suspicious of 
The girl with the broad-brimmed hat. 
A 
gent, who sat at a 
table near, 
Then instantly arose, 
Says he, " I've been a-looking for you, 
To prison now you goes!" 
You burglarized the Camtown Bank, 
And now I've got you pat, 
It's Skeleton Bill, and you're his pals— 
Both you and the broad-brimmed hat. 
Next day before the magistrate 
We were all three arrayed, 
But I 
very soon convinced him 
That a 
victim I'd been made. 
Ten years in prison each they got, 
And ever after that— 
I've steered clear of all " Cousin Jims," 
And girls with a 
broad-brimmed hat.

"THE RUSH IN BATH." 
(Comic Ethiopian Sketch.) 
FOR MINSTREL PERFORMANCE. 
SIX CHARACTERS. 
WRITTEN BY SAUL SERTREW. 
SCENE.— Table and Chair 1? 1st E. 
A large square or 
oblong box without a 
bottom to place over a trap-door near 
centre of the stage, the box to have a 
crank on the right end, 
with a 
cog-wheel and slat attached so as to make a 
noise when 
the crank is turned. 
Have painted in large letters on the 
front of the box: " Rush In Bath." 
As each man is thrown 
in he passes through the trap, then the crank is turned three 
or four times making as much racket as possible. 
Enter, 
Proprietor of the Bath. 
Bath Man.—Well, I've got my patent steam bath in 
working order and everything is ready for business except 
I 
am in want of a 
helper, and I 
have advertised this morn-
ing for a 
good strong healthy able-bodied man. 
Ladies 
and Gentlemen :—This bath is one of the greatest ever in-
vented ; it cures all kinds of ailments and allurements, and 
is very beneficial to drunkards and other peculiar individu-
als. 
One immersion in that bath will make a drunken 
man sober, and cures all desire for liquor, love, defaulca-
tion, staying out late at night, running away with excise 
funds, or any other weakness that we poor frail mortals 
are addicted to without regard to age, color or sex. 
It's 
very good for husbands who are out all hours of the night, 
then come rolling home in the morning and tell their 
Jvives they've been to the lodge!„OWell, all I've got to

[Tin; Rusn Ix I3ATn.—Continued.] 
say, one night's lodging in that bath will make an infallible 
cure, and you'll have peace and happiness for ever after. 
(Rap outside.) 
Bath Man.—Ali, some one is knocking; it may be a 
customer. 
Come in ! 
Come in I 
ENTER, SERVANT. 
Servant. — If you please, sir, is this the place where they 
want a 
man to Rush in Baths. 
Bath Man.—To rush in baths! 
Well, sir, I've advertised 
for a 
man to assist me in giving baths to all who may re-
quire them. • 
Servant.—Well, I'm out of a 
job and if you think I 
would 
be able for you I 
am willing to take hold. 
Bath Man.—Yes, that's what I 
want, a 
man who is will-
ing to take hold—for when my baths are prepared for a 
patient, you must snatch him quickly and rush him right 
in, or the bath loses its strength and spoils the effect of its 
wonderful properties. 
Servant-1V 
ell, sir, I'll snatch him with a 
rush. 
1 
like 
to do things quickly. 
Bath Man.—Now, my good man, I 
think I 
will engage 
you. 
Servant.—Yes, sir ; please tell me what you will pay for 
a 
rusher and what are the duties I 
am to perform. 
Bath Man.—I 
will pay you five cents a 
week for the first 
seven years, board and plank you. 
Serva hi. — What do you mean by board and plank. 
Bath Man.-1'11 tell you! the board is of cross grain, and 
the plank is of somewhat heavier material, very good to 
lay down on 
for a 
flooring. [Aside.—That's a 
very bad 
joke, but I 
got it from a 
carpenter I 
saw in a 
barber shop 
4 
who was trying to chisel the barber out of his shavingq and 
got hammered most to death for not being square]. 
Serve nt.—Yes, sir. 
Yes, sir. 
I 
understand it's all right. 
I'll wall on the job and go to work at once. 
Bath Man.—Very good. 
tell you what I 
want you 
to do. 
When any customer comes in to take a 
bath be 
polite as possible, and after he pays for the bath and I 
say 
Johnny, rush him in. 
You must snatch him and throw 
him in the bath. 
Do it gently you know and then turn 
the crank and let him soak for further orders. 
/Servant.—All right, sir. 
I'll do just as you say. 
Bath Man.—Some of my customers may be pretty 
healthy and robust, and make some objections as to the 
mode of administering the bath, but don't stand on 
ceremony, rush them in at once. 
(Rap is &aid outside. 
Goes to table as tf to write. 
Opens book, d'-c.) 
There, Johnny, 
is a 
customer. 
Go answer the door. 
(Servant goes to door 
and returns as) 
ENTER, FIRST CUSTOMER. 
Customer.—Good morning, sir. 
I 
have called in regard 
to your baths. 
I 
have heard so much about the " Rush in 
Baths " and their infallible cures. 
Well, sir, I 
am troubled 
with a 
very stubborn complaint. 
Bath Man,—Yes, sir. 
Our baths possess all those requi-
site qualities to cure the most stubborn cases. 
Pray, sir, 
what may be the nature of your affliction ? 
Customer. — I 
am troubled sorely with a 
great desire for 
most everything I 
see, and an uncontrollable feeling to 
seize it at once, and everything my hands touch they are 
sure to freeze to it I 
am of such a 
cold temperature. 
Bath Man.—Well, sir, these baths will warm you and 
relieve you of all those propensities; one immersion will 
effectuall5" cure you. f 
[THE RUST' IN BATH. — Continued.] 
Customer.—And how much do you charge for these 
baths? (Goes about picking up things and putting in, Ida 
• Bath Man.—Allow me to examine you for a moment 
and see what temperature of zone you will require. (Takes 
hold of the custome), turns him around with his back to the 
audience.) 
It will be necessary for you to hold up your 
lands above your head so I 
can examine you thoroughly 
and see how strong a 
bath you can stand. 
(Customer puts 
hands above his head. 
Bath _Mtn runs around in front of 
him„ounding his chest and stroking hint down, then gets be-
hind hint and feels in his pockets,takes out pocket- book and all 
sorts (g" raliculous things and passes them to the servant, who 
holds them op to view, then throws them one side, after which 
the Bath Jlan sags)—Well, sir, I 
have examined you and 
don't think you have got much of the greenbackerell lucre 
that often accompanies the disease you are afflicted with, 
and one immersion in the bath will make an infallible cure 
of your popular disease. 
Customer.- 0, thank you, sir; then you are a 
physician 
as well as keeper of these baths. 
Bath Mitn.—Yes, sir ; I 
have studied the anatomy and 
the aperatures of the human frame, where isgenerally con-
cealed the disease you are afflicted with. 
Customer.—And the price of these baths, sir; how much 
(lid you say ? 
Bath :Wm—Well, from general appearance of things, I 
don't think I 
can charge you more than seven dollars and 
a 
half. 
Customer.—Well, sir, I 
don't think I 
have got so much 
money in my clothes. 
m

Bath Man. [Aside.—Not if I 
know myself you haven't. 
Customer. —however, I 
will see how much I 
have got. 
(About to feel in his pockets). 
Bath Man. ( Suddenly stops him.) 
Oh, never mind, sir. 
Never mind, sir. 
You can pay me after you have taken. 
the bath. 
Rush him in, Johnny. 
Rush him in. 
(Goes 
and sits at table as) 
Servant. ( Grabs Customer and handles him very roughly, 
they skirmish for a 
while, then Servant throws him in the 
bath and turns the crank three or four times, which makes 
a 
feaiful noise.) 
Bath _Wm—That will do Johnny. 
Let him soak. 
Servant. ( Stops- and comes forward). 
Say, boss, how 
much money is there in that pocket-book ? I 
want half, 
you know. 
Bath ilLta.—What's that your business. 
(Rap at door). 
Go and answer the door, sir, and don't ask impertinent 
questions. (Servant goes to door as enter)— 
CUSTOMER No. 2. 
Customer. — How do you do, sir. 
Is this the place where 
they rush you in a 
bath and cure all kinds of trouble. 
Bath Man.—Yes, sir; we can cure most anything. 
Customer.—Well, I'm in love ! 
Bath Man.—[ Aside. 
Well, he's a 
pretty looking sub-
ject to be in love! 
Customer.—Excuse me, sir. 
Is there any danger of taking. 
cold after these baths, for I 
am subject to terrible fevers 
and burning sensations, and get excited easy and break 
things, and have to carry a 
piece of ice in my pocket all 
the time to keep cool, and I 
am a 
great sufferer from this 
dreadful malady and inclinations to break things. ( Takes 
hold qf the table roughly and overturns chair. The Bath Man

and Servant stop 7tim from doing any harm). 
Bath Man.—Oh, no, sir; there is no danger of taking 
cold. 
On the contrary, I 
think this bath will do you an 
immense deal of good and cure you of all inclinations to 
break things. 
Customer.— Yes, sir. 
What is the price to take one of 
these baths ? 
Bath. Man.—I 
am afraid you won't be able to take one 
unless you are healthier than you appear to be. 
However, 
I 
will examine you and see if you are able to stand one. 
(Era mines hint. 
Same business as before. 
Pulls out a , large 
night-cap and a 
gin bottle, passes them to the Servant, who 
holds them up to view; then a 
sandwich, which Servant eats; 
then a 
stocking with supposed coin, shakes it and it gingles,he 
puts it in his own pocket). 
There, sir; I 
have examined 
you and find you a 
little better off than I 
expected, and I 
think you are in condition to take a 
bath. 
Custoiner.—And what is the price, sir ? 
Bath Man.—Well, I'll charge you about $25. 
I'll have 
to make the bath pretty strong for you, being you are a 
lover. 
Customer ( dignified). —$25! 
Well, I 
don't think I've got 
anything smaller than a 
fifty. 
(Feels down in his boot leg 
and pulls out an immense pocket-book; opens it and takes out 
bill and hands it to Bath Man). 
Bath :Wan (surprised).—[Aside. — Goodness gracious! how 
could I 
be so careless as to miss this legacy! 
To Servant 
aside.] 
Johnny, when you throw him in the bath hold on 
to his boots, for there is considerable booty there! 
He may 
be Owen Murphy, but he won't owe me a 
cent when he 
comes out ! 
Rush him in, Johnny.

Servant.—(Same business as before). 
Servant.—(After throwing num in the bath comes forward 
feeling of his stomach and squirming about as if he was in 
pain). 
I 
say, boss; I 
don't feel very well after eating that 
sandwich, I 
feel as if I 
was full of sand-paper, and I 
think 
I'd better go home and send my big brother here; he's 
more healthier and stronger than I 
am. 
These customers 
are kind of too heavy for me. 
[Aside.—I 
think that last 
fellow I 
put in the bath fell clean through into the sewer, 
and I'm afraid I'll be arrested for suicide, and I 
want to go 
home]. 
Bath Man.—Oh, nonsense; you are strong enough for 
the work. 
Take a 
bath and you will feel better. 
Servant. — Yes, sir; that may be very good, but I'd rather 
be excused. (Rap at door). 
Bath _Min.—Come, Johnny, fly around; there's another 
customer. (Servant answers door). 
ENTER, CUSTOMER No. 3 
Customer.—( Rushes pellmell with a 
newspaper in his hand, 
runs around the stage tearing of 
pieces of the newspaper and 
throwing them about and giving each one a 
piece of the news-
paper, saying:) Take it! 
Take this! 
Take that! 
Take 
it all! 
Save it! 
Economy is wealth! (Stops suddenly and 
exclaims:) 
Ah ! where am I! 
Yes, ' tis so. 
No ! 
Ah! I 
remember well. ( 1 
ats hands to head). 
Yes, the spell is 
passed and I 
ant free again. 
(Goes to Servant). 
Excuse 
me, sir, don't be frightened. 
You see I am subject to 
spells of give-way-a-tire-ness, and when they come over me 
I 
give way all I 
have got. 
You see my mind is diseased, 
and I 
heard of your famous baths and was recommended 
to call here and take one, and that it would cure my 
disease, 
[THE RH-SH IN 
13ATEC-LContinued.] 
Bath 
I 
think the bath will cure you. 
Customer.—How much will it cost to occupy one of 
:these baths ?. 
Bath Man.-0h; the charge is very . 
reasonable. 
It de-
pends upon how strong a 
bath you can stand, and you will 
be under the necessity of undergoing an examination. 
(Same business:as before). [Aside.—Well, I've examined 
him and he ain't got a 
cent, but he can't fool me in that 
way]. (Goes to Customer). 
I 
have examined and sounded 
you, sir, but it's necessary to know the naked truth of your 
affliction, so just keep quiet as possible during the pro-
cess. 
I'll be gentle with you. 
(Suddenly grabs him very 
roughly, mashes his hat over his eyes, jerks his coat of, throws 
him down, puts one foot on his breast and pulls off his boots, 
hands the articles to the Servant). 
Throw him in the sewer. 
Now, sir; you will be required to balance yourself on 
your eyebrow, stand on your ear, and throw a double 
somersault. and then you will be in condition to take the 
bath 
Customer (astonished).—You don't say so! 
Well, I've 
left my mother-in-law outside and she carries my chalk, 
and I'll have to go and get it. 
I 
always have to chalk my 
feet before I 
do any circus business. 
Bath Man.—Oh, we don't chalk anything down here. 
Ain't got no time to waste. 
Rush him in, Johnny. 
Serrant.—(Seizes him and same business as before, and after 
he gets him in the bath he jumps in and stamps, as if packing 
him in the box). 
I'll learn you better, sir! 
I'll teach you a 
lesson! 
Bath Man.—What are you doing there, Johnny ? 
Sertant.—I'm putting a 
revenue stamp on him, 'cause he 
smuggled in here.

and silly). 
Bath Nitn.—Well,Johnny, who is it? 
Servant.—It's—it's— it's a 
woman! 
Bath Nan (amazed).—A woman! 
(Gels up from seat). 
Show her in the private office. 
No, on second thought, I 
will see her here.

Rush In Bath House, for 
the cure of all kinds of ailments and affections of the 
blood! 
Troman.—Ali ! now The thought rushes to my mind. 
It 
might do me good to take one of the rush in baths. 
You 
see I'm troubled with a 
rush of blood at the head, and then 
Irush headlong into anything. 
I've been known to rush

in a 
dry goods store and then rush out with all kinds of 
things hanging to my dress. 
Dry goods are so very fond 
of me. 
Yes, whenever I 
go into a 
dry goods store there is 
always something sure to follow me. 
Sometimes it's a 
camel's hair shawl, and sometimes a 
policeman ! 
ENTER, SERVANT. 
' Servant ( timidly), — Boss, 
shall I prepare the bath ? 
(Makes gestures behind the Woman as if he should throw her 
in the bath). 
Woman (discovers him).—Who's this? 
What kind of a 
thing is he? 
Bath Man.—That's my servant, who administers the 
baths 
-Woman. — Minister of a 
bath! 
That's the first time I 
ever heard a 
person taking a 
bath required a 
minister in 
attendance! 
Why, I 
thought he was the door mat. I 
stumbled over him outside and pitched him down stairs. 
Servant.—Yes, and I'll get even with you when I 
give 
you a 
bath! 
Bath Mtn ( impa(ient). — I 
can't stand her palaver any 
longer. 
Rush her in, Johnny. 
Rush her in! 
Servant.—( Grabs her very roughly and slings her about. 
She struggles with him and throws him in the bath and turns 
the crank. 
He jumps up and down crying:) 
Boss! 
Boss! 
Come bail me out 
Come take me out! 
She'll pulverize 
me into sausage meat! 
Woman (rushing at Bath Nan). — Ah, I 
have got the rush 
of blood at the head and I must be avenged! 
Blood! 
Iago ! 
Blood ! (
Seizes Bath Nan and throws him in the 
bath and turns the crank rapidly, making a 
terrible racket, 
while they jump up and down crying: " Murder! 
Match! 
Police!" 
Red fire, pistol shot, and scene closes. 
THE GYMNASTIC WIFE, 
sung with Great Applause by miss ELLA W EEINIB. 
SOMB folks think woman ought to be, 
Athletic—museular--strong— 
Alas! I 
used to think so too, 
When I 
courted Lucinda Long; 
When a 
mere girl, she then could do 
Over six good miles an hour, 
And in the feats of strength, 
She'd most remarkable p )wer. 
SITKEN.—Sometimes I 
wish Miss Long had remained Miss 
Long much longer for— 
CHORUS. 
My wife's so strong, and all day long, 
She frightens me out of my life, 
Whatever you do, oh! whatever you do, 
Don't have a 
Gymnastic Wife. 
I 
married sweet Lucinda Long, 
And blessed the lucky catch, 
But soon found out, she was so strong, 
I 
was not near her match; 
For at our wedding breakfast, oh! 
She gave the guests a 
treat, 
By seizing me by the hair of my head, 
And lifting me off my fe.t. 
For my wife's so strong, etc. 
Instead of walking down the stairs, 
She clears the flight at a 
bound, 
Catch hold of me by the tail of my coat, 
And swing me round and round; 
She throws half hundred weights about, 
And twirls the Indian club. 
Or balances, two chairs and the cat, 
On top of the washing tub. 
S. K.— And frequently winds up her performance by 
throwing an astounding somersault from the water- butt on to 
the dust-bin— 
She does the dumb- ells twice a 
day, 
(A terrible weight they are,) 
In the garden she's fixed a 
high trapeze, 
And a 
Horizontal-bar, 
And there she sports her lovely form, 
To the neighbors who come and stare, 
To see niy wife—the pride of my life, 
Going round and round in the air. 
SPoseri.—Or practising the somewhat difficult feat of hang. 
ing by her eye-brows, if I 
dare to remonstrate with her, she 
threatens to throw me into the next street, says she's certain 
she could do it, " once in three times," horror! I 
believe she 
could too—for— 
My wife's so strong, etc.

HE'S WORSE THAN MY BIG BROTHER. 
As sung by JENNIE HUGHES. 
I 
AM tormented night and day, 
The fact I 
cannot smother, 
By my intended husband, 
And also my big brother ; 
They're always teazing me, they are, 
I've not one moment's quiet, 
From morn till night, ' tis their delight 
In the house to cause a 
riot. 
SPOKEN : I 
used to think my brother a 
harem scarem, but 
I 
assure you my sweetheart, Lionel, is a 
perfect limb, always 
playing tricks upon us, but notwithstanding his faults— 
CHORE'S. 
Oh 1 
He loves me and I 
love him, 
We both love one another, 
Ile's such a 
dreadful teaze, he is, 
He's worse than my big brother. 
My brothers led my sweetheart 
To bitter beer and smoking ; 
They don't indulge too much, 
But then ' tis really so provoking. 
In the drawing room or sitting room, 
The fumes are wafted freely, 
The smoke in fumes does arise 
,And always chokes me nearly. 
45 
SPOiEN: No matter how I 
lecture them about smoking 
the drawing-room, they won't desist. 
Then Lionel says to me, 
"Now my darling wife, that is to be, you wouldn't debar your 
husband that will be, of one of his greatest enjoyments, would 
you? 
Well, there, I'll 
put out the pipe to oblige you? 
Directly I 
leave the room, there they are puffing clouds out 
again, but 
Oh I 
He loves me, &c. 
Now my brother climbs the house-top 
And down the chimney cries, 
When we're talking of the future, 
And arranging nuptial ties. 
Then Lionel my intended 
Makes all sorts of false alarms, 
By saying the wardrobe is on fire, 
And swoons in the servant's arms. 
SPOKEN : Well, Fillet him have his own way while he's 
single, but I 
believe he'll be just as bad when married. 
Well, 
I 
don't care if he is.

Some time ago I

With a 
nice young man from Spain; 
And I 
did hope that by and by, 
He'd love me back again. 
But h, my hopes that grew so bright, 
Came pnly to deceive me, 
For another girl, that no one knew, 
Made him go away and leave me. 
CHORUS. 
Oh. he was such a 
nice young man! 
He charm'd me quite, at the very first sight! 
He could give my heart delight, 
He was such a 
nice young man! 
He used to sit down by my side, 
And talk so sweet the while; 
lie pressed my hand within his own, 
And saw me sweetly smile. 
He brought me roses fresh and fair, 
And loved to see me smell them; 
Then friends now ask me, why I'm sad' 
I 
can only smile and tell them— 
Oh ! he was, &.e 
We sang sweet songs and when we talked, 
Our conversation dwelt 
On everything beneath the sun, 
Except what most we felt. 
Sometimes he asked me for a 
kiss, 
And how could I 
refuse him ? 
I 
never, never, never thought 
That I

THE LADY-LIKE YOUNG MAN. 
Sung by Miss JENNIE ENGEL. 
THEY call me sister Willie, for they tell me oft in fun, 
My manners are so lady-like, I 
ought to pass for one. 
And if I'd wear a 
proper dress, and change my style of hair, 
I'd make a 
very charming p.„-irl is what they all declare: 
But my papa he is so cross, and talks in such a 
way. 
A 
noodle, milk-sop, muff, or spoon, he calls me every day: 
He does not mean to be unkind, I 
know he don't, but then 
I'm not the same as other girls, I 
mean as other men. 
Cnoaxs. 
I'm not the same as other girls, I 
mean as other men. 
It 
net my fault, I'm timid, and all rough 1 
companions dread. 
I 
cannot smoke, it makes me ill, and wine gets in my head: 
The opera, concert. ball, or play, possess no charm for me, 
I 
much prefer the wax—work, or a 
friendly cup of tea. 
But hest of all I 
like the park, for oh it is such fun, 
To feed the pretty little ducks with little bits of bun; 
I 
often notice people smile. which makes me blush hut then 
I'm not the same as other girls. I 
mean as otlft,r 
men. 
I'm not the same. Sc 
ne'er can hope to marry, and my heart it sorely tries, 
I 
don't know how to ask them, and the girls don't care for 
sicrlis; 
And if I 
wrote my feelityrs down, and left them at the door, 
I 
should be too ashamed to meet the lady anymore. 
But to the altar if I 
went, so great would be my dread, 
That when I 
had to give the ring, my knees would knock in-
stead; 
It's very funny, is it not, to feel like this, but then 
I'm not the same as other girls, I 
mean as other men. 
I'm not the same, Av. 
LITTLE BAREFOOT, 
Sung by the LA

Words and Music by FRANK HOWARD. 
STANDING where the bleak winds whistled 
Round her small and fragile form; 
Arms within torn garments nestled, 
Standing there at night and morn; 
Hundreds passing by unheeding, 
'Cept to jostle her aside 
There, with bare feet cold and bleeding, 
She in tones of anguish cried— .

Mister! Please give me a 
penny, 
For I've not got any Pa— 
Please, Sir, give me just one penny—

While we beg for tiose with plenty, 
And for them to us unknown, 
Well not forget our little " bare-foots," 
They are heathens nearer home. 
Hailing thus elch passing stranger, 
As they hurriedly went by, 
Some would turn and gaze upon her, 
Pity beaming from their eye; 
I 
Others cast a 
frown upon her, 
Heeding not the plaintive cry; 
"I must have some bread for Mother, 
Or with hunger she will die." 
Mister! Please, _ 
There, one chilly day in winter, 
Barefoot sat upon the pave, 
Outstretch'd were her little fingers, 
But no pennies did she crave— 
There, while begging bread for Mother, 
Death bad chill'd her little heart. 
i'et each day we see some other 
Playing Little Barefoot's part.

To meet Matilda Pager, 
Who thinks it grand, you understand, 
To walk with her Drum-Major.

THE NAUGHTY LITTLE BOY. 
As sung by JENNIE HUGHES. 
THERE was a 
naughty little boy, as naughty as could be, 
Who used to scream, and vex his Ma, and spill his daily tea 
His leisure momeiits he'd employ regardless of her cries, 
In sticking pins and needles in his little sister's eyes ; 
He often used to lose himself, and gave his parents pain,--
By turning up his little nose, when he tamed up again ; 
He kicked his mother's poodle and then out of window threw 
him, 
And bit his little brother so, that people hardly knew him 
He used to smash his pretty toys, his Noah's Ark likewise, 
Where Elephants and Beetles were exactly of a 
size ; 
He amputateti Japhet's arms, and cut of Noah's feet, 
Persisting as lie swallow'd him— that ham was good.to eat ; 
He never once repented, though his gentle parents frown'd, 
But took a 
holiday froth school, to see the kittens drown'd ; 
In hiding Fido's meat he seem'd to take an honest pride, 
And teased the cat so much, that she committed suicide. 
He never shed a 
single tear o'er Pussy's mournful fate, 
But called his nurse a 
naughty name, and went to bed at eight; 
He put the candle out, and with the last expiring spark, 
He thought he saw two eyes thatglared and, glistened in the 
dark; 
He thought he saw a 
mewing, and he thought he heard a 
head, 
57 
That would have been like Pussy's only she waa cold and dead. 
Tho' dreadful eyes drew nearer—oh, most terrible of sights--
He screamed aloud—the cat! the cat! and then they brought 
the lights. 
They look'd about all in and out, but nothing could they see, 
That threw a 
light upon the cause of this catastrophee; 
Until the morning came, when nurse with dreadful horror saw, 
Each nail had grown a 
talon, and each little hand a 
paw; 
Ile took to catching mice, and even rats he'd not refuse, 
Was seized with cataleptic fits, and hung about the mews, 
And thinking he had got nine lives, he played at Pool all day, 
And joined the hippo-phalogical society, they say. 
Ile took to hating pastry, and he grew quite sick o' tart, 
Sat musing at the wiudow, till he heard the cat's-meat cart; 
His parents tried to win him back, with coaxes and with smiles, 
But he wouldn't own a 
feather bed's superior to tiles; 
I 
don't know what became of him, and what's more do not 
care, 
For naughty little boys like that, I 
never could a-bear,--
Be kind to cats and kittens is the moral I 
would tell, 
And send a 
friend to see 'em drowned, and that'll do as well. 
Sung by JENNIE EN(IIIL. 
THE snow has been falling and lies white in the street, 
And thro' it are wandering those little bare tem, 
With an old torn dress that tries to enfold 
Her shivering form from the merciless cold, 
She holds out her hand now chill'd with the blast, 
Hoping to find a 
hind word at last; 
But all pass her by, for they all have a 
home, 
Leaving nobody's treasure to wander alone. 
Ciro/117s. 
Nobody's treasure, nobody's treasure, 
No one will miss her, or speak words of love. 
Nobody's treasure, no one will miss her, or speak words of love. 
Nobody's treasure, Angels bear nobody's treasure above, 
Angels bear nobody's treasure above. 
The storm has been fierce and deserted the street, 
The snow-flakes still fall and are mingled with sleet, 
She sits on a 
doorstep and bitterly cries, 
But warmth is within and no one replies, 
She whispers a 
pray'r she learned on the knee 
Of one who's dead and from sorrow free; 
She's no one to miss her, and no words of love, 
So the angels bear nobody's treasure above. 
Nobody's treasure,

As sung with great success by EMMA DEZODA, in character.\ 
Oh, once I 
was as gay and as happy, 
As any as you'd wish to see, 
I 
had a 
kind father and mother, 
And life was as bright as could be; 
But father has taken to drinking, 
And mother's been taken away, 
And now for my bread I 
go begging, 
From the people I 
meet every day. 
Clionus. 
I'm cold, I'm tired and hungry, 
From begging all day on the pave; 
Since over the hill 'neath the willow, 
My mother was laid in her grave. 
Each one I 
ask for a 
penny, 
Will look with contempt and with scorn, 
While tears in my eyes would be swelling, 
And I'd wish that I'd never was born; 
Then a 
voice in my heart it would whisper, 
Try again and you will succeed, 
Then I'd gather up courage and try it, 
But not one my poor pleadings would heed. 
I'm cold, etc. 
But this cannot all last forever, 
Some day there must be an end, 
And then I'll be happy with mother, 
With angels the good Lord will send; 
And then I 
will be so happy, 
When I 
am laid there to rest, 
be happy with mother and angels, 
Then I'll be sheltered and blest,

°A 
Little Book has lately appeared in print at Mr. A. J. Frenzies, 98 Name 
NW 
Ilan street ceded the •‘ Little Flirt." We cannot say that we recommend 
it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, as we think it would only* 
encourage the bad habit of " flirting." 
Unfortunately, there is enough 
Of it done without any further necessity of explaining " how, when and 
*hero to do it," and this little volume would advise and initiate the EL. 
oorrupted in practicing what is commonly called "flirting.", 
- 
The N. Y. Eeening Telegram writes: " We has.e lately seen 
neat little 
book, bound in Morocco leather, costing 'ewenty-five cents, called the 
"Little Flirt," published by A. J. FISHER, No. 98 Nassau street. 
It 
gives information of the modus operandi of flirting, and of the meaning 
of every motion of the handkerchief, fan, glove and parasol. 
As there 
is nothing at all objectionable in the volume, and its contents might af-
ford some innocent amusement to many, we do not hesitate to recent-
mend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers."

Charlotte Tempi 
e.— To those who have never perused th..• 
sad story of Charlotte Temple, joyed with her in her early pleasured, 
syffipathized and wept with her in her sorrows, and glowed with indig-
nation at the wrongs which she suffered from base, calculating villains, 
an opportunity is afforded of reading one of the most absorbing works 
ever written, proving ' truth strang, r 
than fiction." The poet's lines 
are but a 
just description of the unfortunate Charlotte Temple: 
Her form was faultless, and her mind 
Untainted yet by art, 
Was noble, just, humane and kind, 
And virtue warmed her heart. 
But, ah! the cruel spoiler came—" 
This book, in the language of Mrs. Howson, " affords a 
striking example 
that vice, however prosperous in the beginning, in the end only leads 
to misery and shame."

ner, " the visitation of ihe sins of the parents upon the children."

Courting Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a want of means el 
expressing one's sentiments in such a way as to be non-committal. 
31any young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too diftl. 
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unlady-like encourage-
ment. As a 
resiilt a this dilemma, manylives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been 
prol
onged 
and 
enjoyed 
in 
the 
happiness of matrimony. This pack of Cards will overcome the dial-. 
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
Sh adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes further explanation un-
xtecessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties
