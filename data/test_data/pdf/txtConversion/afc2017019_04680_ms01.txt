Interviewed by Christopher Sims 
October 14, 2017 
 
 
CRUM [0:00:00]: But you can stand there, where I live, you can 
stand and watch the, them launch the missiles out Cape Canaveral 
or look. 
SIMS: Uh-huh. 
CRUM: Yeah.  
SIMS: Just for the record, could you tell, say your name and 
then sp-, do the, spell it.  
CRUM: Jim Crum, or Jimmie Crum, J-I-M-M-I-E C-R-U-M. 
SIMS: Okay, great. Did you have any, history of military service 
in your family?  
CRUM: In my family? 
SIMS: Mhm.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CRUM: My step-father was in the Seabees many years ago, for, not 
for long. And then, my brother, he was in the army for a while 
but, I’m, I’m the oldest so. 
SIMS: Uh-huh. 
CRUM: I did it first. (laughs) 
SIMS: So tell me, was it, was it right after high school that 
you joined? Can you tell me how- 
CRUM [0:00:50]: I joined, wasn’t even finished with high school, 
I was a dropout.  
SIMS: What, what year is this? 
CRUM: 1970. In fact, it was in July of 1970.  
SIMS: So, tell me what your decision-making process was. 
CRUM: You’re not gonna like it if I tell you. Judge says, “You 
need to find another place to live, son”. 
SIMS: Uh-huh. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CRUM: (laughs) That’s basically what it was. 
SIMS: Right. 
CRUM: And I went to see my mom, I was 17 years old, said I’mma 
join the army. And she signed for me and I joined the army.  
SIMS: And where did you, did you come to Fort Polk or- 
CRUM: Fort Jackson, South Carolina.  
SIMS: Uh-huh. 
CRUM: Went through basic training there, left Fort Jackson, 
South Carolina, went to Fort Bliss, Texas Air Defense, went 
through AIT there. 
SIMS: Mhm. 
CRUM: And went to a new unit that was just been activated on Big 
Phil, 1st and 59th 80-A. Didn’t even have NCOs, I was a squad 
leader so they made me a platoon sergeant. 
SIMS: Mhm. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CRUM: And, then I went from there to Korea. After I got married 
12 days before, I went to Korea. (laughs) 
SIMS: (laughs) Wow. So, tell me about, I guess the different 
jobs and assignments you had in the military, just to get a 
sense of like different places you were. 
CRUM: Well I got Korea, I was a senior gunner on the Vulcan Air 
Defense System, 20 mm gun. Then I became squad leader. 
SIMS: Mhm.  
CRUM: I left Korea, I went back to, I came back to the States to 
Fort Carson, Colorado. There I became squad leader again, and 
went through all the military schools, Basic, Non-Commissioned 
Officers course, NCO Academy, and all that. Left there, went to 
Germany, got to Germany and I was a, they made me a squad leader 
slash, and then I made platoon sergeant. Left Germany, went to 
Fort Ord, California. That’s where I got CNTC for the first time 
but it was Camp Irwin back then.  
SIMS: Mhm. 
CRUM: And they made me a platoon sergeant out there and I left 
there and went to recruiting command in Houston, Texas. I spent 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
three years on recruiting command, left recruiting command and 
came to Fort Polk. 
SIMS: As a recruiter? 
CRUM: As a recruiter. 
SIMS: Uh-huh. 
CRUM [0:03:00]: And station commander out of Rosenberg, Texas. 
And left there, come to Fort Polk, Louisiana. Went to work for 
the NCO Academy here and, left there in ’85 and went to Korea 
again and I was platoon sergeant and I come out on the E8 list 
over there. So I come back here and became a first sergeant, 
down, what we call South Fort. I was up in North Fort. Had a 
headquarters unit there, Headquarters Battery 155 80-A, then I 
left there, went back to the NCO Academy, became the Deputy 
Commandant of the NCO Academy, first sergeant. Left there and 
went to the Gulf War, in Germany, was shooting down SCUDs in 
Israel, with Patriot Air Defense which I’d never been to the 
field with but I went to war with. 
SIMS: Mhm. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CRUM: Left there and I said if I ever get back to Fort Polk, I 
will retire, and I came back to Fort Polk and I retired. 
SIMS: So tell me a little bit about Camp Irwin, remind me what 
year this was and then what it, what- 
CRUM: First time I, Camp, Camp Irwin it was 1978, and, wasn’t a 
whole lot there. Went there for a 30-day field problem, we 
convoyed from Fort Ord, California to Camp Erwin, which was two 
day, three day convoy. And I was in a Gamma Goat, pulling a 
towed Volken. Had a long haul. 
SIMS: Mhm.  
CRUM: In fact, I went to, in front of the recruiting board, I 
come out of Ford Ord, er, Fort Irwin, three days early for the 
field problem, I’m going in front of the recruiting board to go 
on recruiting duty, get out of Fort Ord, California. Any place 
that land moves under my feet, four to eight, four times in 
eight months, I don’t need to live there no more.  
SIMS: Uh-huh. 
CRUM: I went through four earthquakes. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SIMS: Wow. 
CRUM: Yup. So that’s basically it and then I come back here and 
I decided to retire in ’93 and I went to work for roleplay. 
SIMS: So why, of all the, so you went to all these different 
places, what was it about Fort Polk or Louisiana that made you 
want to-  
CRUM: I love to hunt and fish and at the time, that was the only 
place had a job open for me cause they didn’t have no slots open 
in Germany when I come off recruiting command.  
SIMS: Mhm.  
CRUM: And, come here, and it was, the army at the time was, you 
come to Fort Polk, you go to Korea, that was the, the routine. 
You went to Korea, you came back, come back to Korea. It was 
kind of like a turnaround. My daughter grew up here, she 
graduated high school here. 
SIMS: Mhm. 
CRUM: Loved it here, so.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SIMS: So what was, so this is ’93 you retire? 
CRUM: ’93 I retired. 
SIMS: And what was roleplay like in ’93? 
CRUM: I was the head of the police force, I was, gendarme.  
SIMS: Mhm. 
CRUM: Of Cortina. And, it was a lot of fun. I also had all the 
vehicles, we, I was the, over all the vehicles that we used for 
roleplay. Which were all called AH’s and reasoning for calling 
the AH’s because when they come down from Chaffee, the guys 
running the supply up there, his mom gave them those names 
because she called them assholes. 
SIMS: (laughs)  
CRUM: And they were, you know, everything from old Chevrolets 
and, really just, pieces of junk, we kept them running to get 
the role players back and forth, down range and- 
SIMS: Right. So how many people, early on, are like in the- 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CRUM: There were five full-timers and then we had, depending on 
role play, how many role players we needed per, to occupy the 
villages out there.  
SIMS: You were one of the five? 
CRUM: I was one of the five, mhm.  
SIMS: So TD and Jack- 
CRUM: TD Holcomb, me, no Jack wasn’t full time, no. I was full 
time before Jack. In fact, Jack used to work for me as one of my 
cops, back then. It was me, TD, Darren McConnell, Willene 
Patton, and Tom Barry. Tom Barry retired, South Com Major he 
dead now, Agent Orange got him. But, that was in ’93, ’94, ’95, 
and January of ’96, I went to South Fort and became a tech, 
assistant tech lead for Special Forces. And I spent, 19.5 years 
doing that. 
SIMS: Yeah, wow.  
CRUM: Yeah. 
SIMS: So, was that involving roleplay as well? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CRUM: We had role players who went out there and, but not as 
much because when rotation unit comes in, go through the 
rotation, I was the one who sat behind the radio and took down 
all the information, what they were doing out there as far as 
training was, and then put it in the computer.  
SIMS: Mhm.  
CRUM: And for the After Action Reviews and all this other stuff, 
so. And, go to NTC and take the unit out there, the OC’s go out 
there and evaluate the units out there while they’re going 
through the training. I did the same thing out there.  
SIMS: So back to the, the years when you’re doing roleplay, I 
guess ’93- 
CRUM: To ’96. 
SIMS: To ’96. Can you describe the villages and structures to 
me, relative to like how they are now? 
CRUM [0:08:57]: Oh, they, ain’t no comparison really. They’re, 
right back then, we had Corti-, Carness, Huffton, what did we 
call the one in South, Youngstown, Youngstown down there, we had 
three, three villages. Now, there is a bunch out there, you 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
know, and, Carness is still out there, by the NFLS which Smith, 
relative to, Smithville is right on the, land zoning out there 
was. And, Youngstown was down at the bottom, Huffton was halfway 
between Carness and Youngstown. Jettertown, not Youngstown, 
Jettertown, Youngstown now is out there as you go down the green 
gravel road.  
SIMS: Mhm. 
CRUM: Yeah. 
SIMS: And how did they like pick the locations in the Box for 
the places? Were there already some training sites there? 
CRUM: No, they built them, they built be-, in fact, I helped 
paint the buildings in Carness, and, down in Jettertown, and all 
those. We built those, we planted trees, planted gardens, we did 
all that good stuff. 
SIMS: Mhm. 
CRUM: So. And units came through, did their training, left and 
we’d go out there and clean up and redo it, get ready for 
another one.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SIMS: Right, so, it’s kind of, probably did a lot more different 
type of things than, how they have it now is probably - 
CRUM: Oh yes, it was different, totally different than it is 
now. Like I said, I was head of police force, I had, you know, I 
sat in the ACC buildings up there, with the unit commander that 
was coming in and the governor of Cortina. And tell them, hey, 
you don’t speed through my town, and you don’t do this, and 
don’t do that, and it was, it was a lot of fun.  
SIMS: Yeah. 
CRUM: It’s, it’s different. But, yeah. 
SIMS: So since it was so early, there, was there anything from 
Tigerland or anywhere else that gave you all some guidance about 
how to do it or is it- 
CRUM: Nope. The island of Aragon, and all that, the Cortina, how 
do I wanna put it, the Cortina, what you gonna do in Cortina, 
there’s, their customs and all that stuff was already pre-
written up in Fort Chaffee. Before they ever moved down here 
with JRTC, there was an area of study, area of studies is what 
I’m looking for, an area of study of Aragon, you know, and the 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
surrounding countries that were coming in to invade and all 
this. And what are you gonna come in here with mainly, they were 
coming in here to protect the civilians and the, from the 
invasion from the, other countries. Victoria and all that good 
stuff so. That’s what we did. (laughs) Yeah. 
SIMS: So what was the most fun part of that? It sounds like, in 
the early days, there’s a lot of- 
CRUM: Being the head of police and going out there and seeing 
the Opfor, be walking around in the village and you’re walking 
there and you’re seeing the green suiters which are the, player 
unit that’s there. Any OpFor, them are mixed in, in the 
nighttime they come in, sabotage the green suiters, you know. 
SIMS: Mhm.  
CRUM: Or if they’re doing a soft mission come in and wipe out 
the whole sniper and come in there, satchel charges and blow up 
the buildings and stuff, so.  
SIMS: Mhm.  
CRUM: Lot of fun. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SIMS: Did you have any type of training that was similar to that 
when you were younger in the- 
CRUM: No. Nothing like that. Nope. 
SIMS: So what, did you have any sense, like big picture, like 
when and why they decided to like introduce that type of 
training? 
CRUM: Only by area of study. The point, because everybody who 
was a role player up there, were, we had classes, that were 
taught by the writers and stuff that wrote the scenario and that 
wrote the role play instructions. I had a sheet that told me, 
that as the head of Cortina, or the, gendarme, police chief, 
this is my mission, and what I was to do. I would get briefed by 
TD Holcomb or whatever if I was going out there to, let’s say, 
go out to Carness and get with the mayor out there, Pete McQue 
at the time was the mayor. He’d come down, Chaffee will, what to 
go out there and talk to him about or what, tell the unit or any 
of this other stuff. And we’d have writers down South Fort, 
intermingle with the role players and stuff and they’d run our 
scenario.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SIMS: Mhm. Did the writers like, come into the box to get a 
sense of like- 
CRUM: Sometimes, they did. Sometimes, they did because, in fact, 
I can tell you a story. Me and Jack, he can tell you about it, 
went up to ISB, they all come into ISB up at Alexander. 
SIMS: Is that the airport? 
CRUM [0:14:00]: Stationary. Yeah. We went up there and Jim 
Williams, he was one of the roleplay writers, he was playing a, 
one of the role players, he was playing the governor, lieutenant 
governor. He was going to the ISB. We said, “Okay, come on, 
you’ll ride with us Jim?” “Oh no, y’all take up a Humvee, it’s 
too hot, I’mma take my car”. Okay. We got up there, go in to 
ISB, they let me through because I’m wearing a uniform badge, 
got ID, and all this other good stuff. And as we go by, here’s 
Jim Williams, over on his knees, and with his hands behind his 
head, and they’ve got him under. “Oh, Inspector Crum!” I said, 
“How you doing, Mr. Williams?” and kept right on walking. 
SIMS: (laughs) 
CRUM: So, you know. It was a lot of fun. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SIMS: Yeah. 
CRUM: It was, there no other job in the world like it, really. 
That I’d ever run into.  
SIMS: Mhm. So that ISB, even though it’s at like, is it a 
military space or it’s part of the airport?  
CRUM: Part, it used to be part of the airport, yeah. 
SIMS: Okay, and they’re, but now they’re building one here? 
CRUM: Not that I know of. 
SIMS: Okay. 
CRUM: No. ISB, they’re still using it, that’s where the troops 
come in and bus down to here, yeah.  
SIMS: So in between there and Leesville, when they’re like 
convoying, is that part of the box, or part of the training? Or 
basically nothing happens? 
CRUM: Nothing happens until they get into the box.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SIMS: Uh-huh. 
CRUM: Yeah. 
SIMS: And that’s, presumably for safety reasons and- 
CRUM: Yeah.  
SIMS: Uh-huh. 
CRUM: And you got state police and all that monitoring and all 
that stuff too, in the convoys and stuff, so. Pretty secure. 
SIMS: Mhm. 
CRUM: Yup. 
SIMS: What was the hardest part of the job in role playing? 
CRUM: Hours. I got stuck out there Jettertown one afternoon, or 
one morning, I went out there at eight o’clock in the morning. I 
didn’t go home until three o’clock the next day. If a fight come 
in that night, I was up all night long.  
SIMS: Mhm. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CRUM: But hey, you know, wasn’t everyday so that was one of 
those things. We used to run, that was probably the hardest part 
about roleplay. Now, working down South Fort’s spo-, office, 
twelve hour shifts, so, you- 
SIMS: Right. 
CRUM: Day shift or night shift. It was set by a computer. We 
said we were 70 in fluorescent because we didn’t go outside, we 
work indoors. So. 
SIMS: So rela-, I mean, relative to all of your military 
experience like out in the field, is, was the role playing 
comparable or easier or harder? 
CRUM: I wish we’d had it when I was in the army, back then, 
because we didn’t have that, okay. That would have helped a lot 
when I went to Israel, to learn how to deal with the, civilian 
population over there. It would help a lot to go to Korea when 
you go out to the field over there, you learn how to deal with 
the population over there. When I was in the unit, the unit was 
blind, you know, you go there, you don’t speak the language, you 
don’t understand the customs, you go through their little 
customs class. Here, it’s beaten into you before-    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SIMS: Right. 
CRUM: You know, the unit gets there.  
SIMS: So, what were some of the issues that came up in Israel or 
Korea that this type of training-  
CRUM: How to deal with, how to deal with civilian population. 
Yeah, basically how to talk to them, how to, you know, their 
customs and all this, yeah, where, you don’t know that, yeah we 
had some studies but when you go to war, you go to war, you 
know. You, you land, you’re in one place like Frankfurt, Germany 
one day, you’re in Israel the next day. (laughs) 
SIMS: I’m imagining, correct me where I’m wrong about this, but 
like in Israel, I’m guessing you’re at, like a missile boundary.  
CRUM: I was in a base, they built me a base, like there, I was 
in the compound where they did airborne training for the Israeli 
soldiers. And it was fenced in, I had fifty guards walking the 
perimeter at all times. And, they built it for me when I landed.  
SIMS: Mhm. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CRUM: It took them three days to build me a compound, for me to 
set up our unit.  
SIMS: And what was like the interactions with the civilians, or 
is it the Israeli military?  
CRUM: What, yeah, it was the Israeli military. It wasn’t that 
bad because Israel, English is the second language.  
SIMS: Mhm.   
CRUM: So most people speak English. And, it got along pretty 
good, I had a great relationship with the commander of the 
compound that I had. He was a major in the Israeli army. Hard 
part getting used to in Israel was walking around watching all 
these people walk around carrying guns with live ammunition and 
I’m talking about females, everybody.  
SIMS: Uh-huh. Especially at that time, right? 
CRUM: Yup. Sure is. Everybody’s in the military there. 
Everybody’s in the military. Reserve, reservists, whatever you 
want to call it. Females, on down, so.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SIMS [0:19:13]: So you’re talking US Military and then working 
afterwards in roleplay and, Fort Polk, I guess you’ve probably 
seen a lot more women in the force. How has that changed, like 
day to day life? Like in the army, from your perspective. 
CRUM: Well, as a first sergeant, I had, my last unit in Germany. 
I had females, I had lieutenants, in fact, I had a lieutenant 
shoot down a SCUD so. These guys, it’s an issue, especially now 
if you look at the Arabs and the way they train here for Iraq 
and Afghanistan and stuff. Females ain’t, they’re open to the 
side, you know, stay away and all this. I didn’t have no 
problems with them, mainly, wasn’t too bad I guess, come to 
think of it.  
SIMS: Mhm. 
CRUM: But it wasn’t, if you’re, any unit that is combat arms, 
this is before now where the females are allowed in the combat 
arms, we didn’t have them around. You didn’t have to watch your 
language or any of that other stuff. And then after I started 
getting females, I found out, okay, you can go out there and 
call them all a bunch of a-holes as long as you call them all, 
not just one, call them all, you know. That’s the way it goes. 
Other than that, wasn’t too bad. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SIMS: Mhm. So, back in the role playing days, can you tell me 
about some of the, like types of interactions that you sat in on 
between like the governor and the rotational unit? Like, what 
are they, what are they discussing at the meetings? 
CRUM: They would discuss stuff like what could the unit coming 
in do to assist the civilians as far as, you know, if they need 
water purification or if they need, and that was a big thing, 
like the governor used to say, “Okay we got water out there 
that’s contaminated in Carness. And we can’t water our crops, or 
we can’t harvest our crops, or we need to repair these 
buildings”, and yeah, you just try to get the coming in unit to 
do all kinds of stuff for you. Now they come out there and 
promise you the world, but they only here for 12 days.  
SIMS: Right. 
CRUM: Yeah, so yeah, I’mma do this, two weeks from today and 
you’re knowing that, you’re sitting there going, you know this 
already but you can’t say nothing because it’s part of the play.  
SIMS: Mhm. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CRUM: Yeah. But they come in, promise you the world. And I don’t 
blame them, I woulda done the same thing. 
SIMS: Right.  
CRUM: Yeah. 
SIMS: So would you participate in an After Action Review?  
CRUM: I did, when I was in role play, and some of them, they 
would call me in whenever they were doing their After Action 
Review to get my views on what I thought they could have done 
better.   
SIMS: Mhm. 
CRUM: Or where they really screwed up or whatever. And, 
basically, wouldn’t be long, 30 minutes, whatever, after the 
rotation’s over.  
SIMS: So let’s say in that After Action Review the rotational 
unit, like, made a pretty major mistake, but there, I don’t 
know, there’s some debate about it and you know, you would come 
and give your perspective and maybe the, the head of the 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
rotation unit is sort of upset or thinks it’s not fair, 
something. Do they, like, talk back to you or they just sort of- 
CRUM: Oh yeah, they, they, they have inputs, yeah, they have 
inputs or they’ve said, “What about this?” Well, this is what 
you’ve done, you know, you’re, you got out there, you run over 
to this child out there, you run over this animal, you killed it 
out there in the village, and now what are you gonna do to 
compensate for it, you know. Or you, or, you hit this tree out 
there that’s for bearing apples and now it’s, you know, it’s a 
livelihood of that family there, that’s how they make their 
money. Or you killed their chickens, which they didn’t. None of 
the little animals were killed or none of this other stuff, but, 
we always had something, you know, you’d throw in there. And, in 
the end, you’d have a colonel in there, “Oh no, my people didn’t 
do that, or “Oh, we’re sorry, we will pay you for this or 
whatever”. It’s a learning curve, learning thing, yeah.  
SIMS: SO, who’s running that After Action Review, like OC’s or? 
CRUM: Just the OC’s.  
SIMS: Yeah. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CRUM: Senior OC’s, yeah. Normally you got a senior OC and each 
TAFF, Training Action Facility, oh God, I’ve been gone too long. 
Been retired over two years now. Fully retired. Anyway-  
SIMS: Is TAFF one of the classrooms? 
CRUM [0:24:08]: Yeah, it’s, the TAFF is where they get in there 
and they, they monitor the radios and they, everything that’s 
going on, in the box. 
SIMS: Yeah, like at Shughart-Gordon, there’s like a bunker area. 
CRUM: Oh, that’s not a TAFF, that there, Shughart-Gordon is a 
live fire complex and that’s where they get in there and they 
run the live fire. 
SIMS: Okay, that’s something different. 
CRUM: Yeah, totally different, yeah. But, feedback facility, 
Training Action Feedback Facility, okay. You sat in there, the 
TAFF, there’s a senior in each TAFF and he’s the one that 
presents the ARR to the unit, like you’ve got, down there, 
you’ve got special forces, you got combat service support, you 
got filled artillery, you got, all those other nurs-, TAFF’s for 
each one of those. And at the end of the rotation, they all get 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
together, notes together and stuff and their seniors provide, 
provide them with an AAR, after action review. You tell them, 
“Yeah you did this good, no you screwed this up, you all still 
come out smelling like a rose”. 
SIMS: Mhm. 
CRUM: So. 
SIMS: So how are OC’s selected, like where do they, what- 
CRUM: They’re, that’s a good question. I’m not sure, the units, 
when they, some of these OC’s down here that come in, they’re 
assigned OC duty from when they come in here. From Germany or 
wherever they’re coming from, they come back, they’re, said, 
“You’re going to Fort Polk, you’re gonna be an OC.” Then they go 
through OC training. And, then they become an OC.    
SIMS: Is OC training here at Fort Polk? 
CRUM: Yeah. It’s normally unit taught, like if there’s filled 
artillery unit here or Tenth Mountain here. If they got OC’s 
they go out there and they’ve got a OC academy or whatever. Used 
to have a OC Academy here, trained by contractors, they don’t do 
that no more. Too costly.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SIMS: So how long are you, somebody an OC?  
CRUM: Normally two, three years. 
SIMS: Uh-huh. 
CRUM: Yeah, couple years. Until they rotate out of here, so.  
SIMS: So I, from what I’ve heard, like, well some people like 
recruiting, a lot of people like, think it’s a less desirable 
job?  
CRUM: Recruiting’s not one of the jobs, not one of the glorified 
jobs in the world depending on where you’re at.  
SIMS: Right. 
CRUM: So, sometimes, some places it’s easy, some places it 
ain’t. And I was out there when they come back and they put all 
the stipulations on, you can only put this type of individual 
in, gotta score this on the ASVAB test. 
SIMS: Right. 
CRUM: Yeah.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SIMS: So how does OC sort of rank as a job, like-  
CRUM: They, it’s good. Lot of the, when they go back to a 
regular unit back in, wh-, I’m talking now mainly about Special 
Forces. These guys come out here and they go through Site D up 
there, and they become an OC, and then they go back to one of 
the groups, third group, first group, tenth group, whatever. 
They go back to doing their job.  
SIMS: Mhm.  
CRUM: This OC training gives them an insight on what, they don’t 
get away from the army because you’ll see your units coming 
through your, and you stay up to abreast, what’s going on and 
doctrine and all this other good stuff, because you’re watching 
them. And then you leave here and you go back to the unit. You 
might go back to the unit, they remember you, back here, “Hey 
yeah, you were that a-hole that was down there at Fort Polk”. My 
OC gave me all this stuff but lot of times, they know the people 
in the group if they come from that group, because they’re such 
a small unit. Now, artillery, all that other stuff, aviation, 
CSS, that’s not necessarily the case because there’s much larger 
organizations, so, throughout the army.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SIMS: So, when you were going to Fort Irwin so often, thirty 
times I think you said. 
CRUM: Yeah. 
SIMS: Why, like, what percentage of the year are you there, 
like, why, why aren’t you moved there?  
CRUM: Oh. Because, I lived here- 
SIMS: Right. 
CRUM [0:28:27]: Site D, or Special Forces here, they’re only 
ones that have 06 throughout the army. So when there’s a unit 
training out at Fort Irwin, they send the OC’s out there. Well 
they gonna need TAFF support, which is us. So we go out there 
too. And we sit in a building, by a computer, listen to the 
radio and take down all that information. But it’s, it’s, you 
know, it’s TDY, basically what it is.    
   
SIMS: Right. 
CRUM: Temporary Duty. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SIMS: So at Fort Irwin, I know, it’s, I remember, there’s one 
building that looks down-  
CRUM: Star Wars building. 
SIMS: That what they call it? 
CRUM: Well there’s one when you first walk on post, all the 
antennas and stuff, kind of like JRTC. That’s Star Wars 
building, that’s where all the stuff is run out of, that’s where 
the TAFF’s are. 
SIMS: Okay. So in the, so I, let’s say you’re driving, I guess 
it’s north, out of, the main part of Fort Irwin, you get to a 
village and then you bear right, you drive like 20 minutes and 
then you go right and it’s about another 20 minutes, and there’s 
a huge, complex-  
CRUM: Complex, there you go. 
SIMS: And then, then up on this cliff, there’s like a, building 
there that has like the cameras- 
CRUM: Yeah. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SIMS: and the smells 
CRUM: Oh yeah. 
SIMS: And then I guess a couple classrooms where they do the 
AAR. 
CRUM: Yeah.  
SIMS: So, is that where your- 
CRUM: No, no, we’re on the post, we’re on the post. 
SIMS: Oh okay. 
CRUM: We don’t go down range, the unit goes down range with the 
OC’s, we don’t go down range.  
SIMS: So like what happens in that building versus what happens 
in yours? 
CRUM: That’s where they do the AARs and that’s where they 
monitor, like you said, the cameras and stuff, down range,  
SIMS: Mhm.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CRUM: And Fort Irwin has got one of the biggest camera complexes 
you ever seen as far as watching the training. They’ve got tanks 
and shit moving around out there. Yup. 
SIMS: So at Fort Polk there’s basically something comparable? 
There’s a TAFF?  
CRUM: Yeah, there’s, there’s, yeah, there, there the same things 
but like the headquarters building, JRTC headquarters building 
down there where it’s got all the antennas. Call it, we call it 
the IS building, instrumentation, system. It’s where all your 
computers and your stuff is, and your TAFF’s are sitting in 
there, monitoring. 
SIMS: And are those, the jobs in the TAFF, are they military 
jobs, civilian jobs, contractor jobs, or like a mix? 
CRUM: You have, there’s a mix. You, you have contractors in 
there that are handling the equipment, the computers and stuff 
like that, you have your TAFF operators who are in there 
monitoring the unit down range and all this good stuff. And you 
have your military counterpart there that’s in there in case you 
run into something, cause I’m a civilian. I can’t tell, the C7 
or E8 out there, you gonna do this. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SIMS: Right. 
CRUM: But I look over here and tell this Captain, “Hey, you need 
to tell him do that” and that captain turn around tells him, 
yeah. 
SIMS:  Okay. So does it make sense to view, like, what that mix 
is?  
CRUM: Yeah it does. 
SIMS: Yeah. 
CRUM: It keeps it, calm. (laughs) 
SIMS: Right. 
CRUM: Oh yeah. 
SIMS: So way back, maybe when you started your career, was it 
more, like, something like, even though they didn’t have that 
exactly, was basically everybody military? And then, - 
CRUM: I didn’t deal with civilians. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SIMS: Over time, like civilians and contractors came-  
CRUM: I never dealt with civilians or contractors. No, I didn’t 
even like them.  
SIMS: So when did that change, like- 
CRUM: When I got out, (laughs) I became the one. 
SIMS: (laughs) 
CRUM: Yeah. And Jack can tell you the same thing. I ain’t, I 
ain’t cared for the damn civilians, no. They were a pain in my 
butt.  
SIMS: Mhm, yup. So how would you, would you say it’s, now that 
you’ve seen both sides, does it seem like it’s a good 
functioning relationship?  
CRUM: It is, it is because it’s, they got your back and you got 
their back. You don’t let stuff happen cause, you know, you been 
there and you seen it.  
SIMS: Mhm. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CRUM: You know, they won’t let stuff happen to you because they 
know how to deal with the other side of the house too. But the 
army’s changing, so.  
SIMS: Mhm.  
CRUM: Gentler, kinder army. (laughs) 
SIMS: So the, I guess when I go into the box, I can, you know, I 
get some sense of like how many villages are in each place like, 
how, how much is not visible, like, to me in terms of behind the 
scenes? Like, what are, what are the different types of jobs 
that, cause I know there’s like writers, there’s- 
CRUM: There’s fire markers, there’s fire markers out there, 
there’s writers, there’s role players, there’s Opfor, yeah, it 
just depends on what you’re going to out to observe. You know, 
if you wanna go out there and observe, let’s say, a truck bomb 
that’s gonna go off around the village or something, you’re 
gonna have no lan-, there’s fire markers there, they gonna set 
it up, they go mark it off so people don’t get inside the 
explosion area.  
SIMS: Mhm. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CRUM: They gonna set off your pyro. Opfor, you know, OpFor could 
be out there, and they’d be mingling with the village and all of 
a sudden, they turn around and shoot somebody. Just depends on 
scenario. And what you’re going out to see.  
SIMS: So when you started, like in ’93, did, did Opfor come, 
like with the move from Fort Chaffee or? 
CRUM: No, they were here. 509th was here. They, well they come 
down here from upper I guess it was, and 509th is the Opfor. 
They’re a military unit and they train to do that. And they’ve 
very good at it because this is their home.                           
SIMS: Mhm. 
CRUM [0:34:17]: They know every tree out there and every road 
and all this other good stuff and the blue-for, the training 
unit coming here couldn’t figure out how in the world did Opfor 
come out of, wear us out, kill us, and all this good stuff. This 
is their home. This is their backyard, they know what goes on 
out there. So. 
SIMS: So how, how do soldiers end up in the 509th, are they 
typically-  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CRUM: They’re assigned to it. 
SIMS: Uh-huh. 
CRUM: They’re assigned to it just like any other unit, you know.  
SIMS: Is it, more likely that they would have had, like, can you 
go to basic AIT and then be in the 509th?  
CRUM: Yes. Primarily, infantry. 
SIMS: Uh-huh. 
CRUM: Okay, it’s a ground pounder, it’s a snake eater, bark 
eater, whatever you wanna call it. They’re infantry.  
SIMS: So they wouldn’t necessarily have had, like prior 
experience like overseas before they’re- 
CRUM: They could, they could be assigned back here to the 509th, 
they come from Germany, from Korea, or wherever, or from another 
post, Fort Hood, you know, it could be assigned 509th. 
SIMS: Do you have a sense of like how, like obviously you 
wouldn’t want, ideally, like 509th to be entirely people who are 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
just out of AIT. Like how do they, do they monitor like the mix 
of-  
CRUM: They, they have the, well they start out, you got your 
privates, you’ve got your specialists, but mo-, mainly, your 
509th is E-4 and above.  
SIMS: Mhm. 
CRUM: And NCO’s, because they’re dealing with, they’re a little 
bit more mature than you would be if it was straight out of 
basic AIT.  
SIMS: Mhm, makes sense. 
CRUM: Yeah. Army thought it out pretty good. It makes a lot of 
sense really. (laughs) 
SIMS: Right. And so how long would you want, would one typically 
be in the 509th? Is like a two to three year thing? 
CRUM: Yeah, it’s about like that. Yeah, it’s a normal tour, 
until you move on and go to Germany or go to another unit or 
whatever, get promoted, depends.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SIMS: And is that regarded as a pretty good assignment? 
CRUM: Yeah. 
SIMS: Yeah. 
CRUM: All the guys that I know in the 509th, they liked it. 
SIMS: Mhm.  
CRUM: Yeah. Yeah, they, yeah, it’s what you make of it. (laughs)  
SIMS: So with that job, I guess they’re on, are they working 
like 24/7 during the rotation?  
CRUM: Well, how that works is they have a unit or a platoon down 
there, let’s say that they’re gonna be the Opfor for this 
rotation, they work them out there, if one of them gets killed 
over here in this town, he’s liable to show up in another town, 
tomorrow, he’s his brother’s brother or brother or whatever. 
Yeah, so, they support the rotation. Just like everybody else. 
SIMS: But there, are they like, basically sleeping in the woods? 
CRUM: Oh yeah.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SIMS: Yeah 
CRUM: Oh yeah, they go out there and spend four, five days in 
the woods, come back in, take a shower, and go back out. 
SIMS: Mhm. And when they, like go in to take a shower, is it 
sort of like, should they call timeout and then they can sort of 
drive out without- 
CRUM: No.  
SIMS: Any danger? 
CRUM: No. 
SIMS: It’s all, until they get to the edge of the box? 
CRUM: Yup, til they get out of the box, yup. And, still alive.  
SIMS: Right.   
CRUM: Yeah. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SIMS: And then, so, let’s say a rotation is two weeks, and 
you’ve got another two weeks in the month in which there’s not a 
rotation, what does the 509th do- 
CRUM: Train.  
SIMS: During that time? 
CRUM: Mhm. 
SIMS: And what- 
CRUM: They, you’re, in the military you’ve always got your 
training going on, you’ve got to have ranges, you’ve got to have 
this and that, and stay proficient in your weapons training and 
all this other stuff so, they train if they’re not in rotation. 
Or they do the other admin stuff, go on sick call, hospital 
appointments, wives, leave, all this other stuff. 
SIMS: Right. I know some of it you might not be able to talk 
about but the, how would you say the SF training differs from 
like a regular rotation unit, is it, just more, that they’re 
expected to be more versatile- 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CRUM [0:38:33]: Somewhat, yes, yes. They have, their missions 
are a lot different, (laughs) believe me, than the normal unit 
would be coming here. 
SIMS: Mhm.  
CRUM: And like you said, I can’t go into a whole bunch of that, 
because it is - 
SIMS: Right. 
CRUM: Yeah. Well you see what’s going on in the world today, and 
you can tell, you know, in Afghanistan and then Syria and over 
there in Africa, you hear about the Special Forces on the news 
the other day, two of them got killed in Africa. 
SIMS: Mhm. 
CRUM: A lot of people don’t even know they’re there. 
SIMS: Right. 
CRUM: (laughs) So, yeah.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SIMS: So what was your sense of, when they did, MREs I think 
it’s called, when they had- 
CRUM: Mission Readiness Exercises. 
SIMS: Yeah, like, like actual Afghan Americans and Iraqi 
Americans, as role players alongside, sort of role players from 
the area- 
CRUM: Call them cultural roles. 
SIMS: Cultural, like how was that, how did that, what was that 
interaction like and- 
CRUM: It was good because it gives them a little bit of a sense 
of what, the unit, they will not be surprised when they get over 
there to Afghan, run into an Afghani over there in Afghanistan 
and they actually know a little bit about what they’re going to 
be expected of them once they get there.  
SIMS: Mhm.  
CRUM: And my feeling and I’m sure Jack could tell you the same 
thing, if the training here can save one life, it’s worth every 
bit of it. Something that you learn here, JRTC, and you see it 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
over there and you say, “Well I don’t really need to do that 
because I seen that in JRTC” and save one life, it’s worth all 
of it. 
SIMS: Mhm. So what, can you think of a particular, lessons that 
you heard about or saw in roleplay that seemed to be, like I’m 
thinking of one time there was a scenario where there was like a 
suicide bomber in Iraq- 
CRUM: IED, suicide bombers, all that stuff there, yes.  
SIMS: So what were the, can you think of any unusual scenarios 
that like one wouldn’t have, wouldn’t possibly imagine until 
like you kind of run into them at the box? 
CRUM: No, not off the top of my head, I can’t. Mm-mm. Cause 
they’re pretty well scripted so most of it, there’s, none of 
it’s free play. Some of it’s free play, in the Opfor sense that 
if they get, opportunity presents itself, that they can take out 
this or whatever, soldier, whatever, suicide bomb or, go ahead 
and do it. That’s called free play, most of it I s scripted, 
it’s really scripted. You get out there until you see, I mean, 
you follow the line, there’s no free play.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SIMS: Right. It sounds like there was more free play early on? 
CRUM: There was, early on, yes, back in the early days, but as 
we come on to MREs and, that, no, it’s all scripted.  
SIMS: So, what’s your opinion on, on what’s better and what’s 
worse, what’s not as good when you have the scripted? 
CRUM: Scripted I think is, is pretty good because you, you know 
what to expect if you’re, somewhat you know what to expect if 
you been there before and you’ve seen it, because they don’t 
change up a whole bunch, only MRE. You know, it’s this, on this 
day you gonna see this and this, this, this, this, and, it’s 
scripted. Free play, you get out there and it’s basically 
telling OpFor, “Do your best, do whatever you wanna do, go for 
it”. 
SIMS: Mhm. 
CRUM: And you end up having a bunch of stuff messed up (laughs). 
You could have a much of stuff messed up. So, just depends on 
the players. 
SIMS: Mhm.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CRUM: Yeah.  
SIMS: So tell me a little bit about the MILES gear. I’ve heard 
some people say there’s like a, it can be a near miss and it 
goes off and then it’s something different if you get- 
CRUM [0:42:53]: Yeah, it’s a tone, there’s a tone in there, it’s 
got a sensor on it. If they shoot at you and near miss you, you 
know, it’s, you’ll hear a beep, and if they shoot and hit you 
and it’s kill or whatever, hit one of the sensors, steadily 
toned. So you’re there, you sit down, you got a little yellow 
key, you turn it off until somebody comes up and resets you. But 
you’re dead.  
SIMS: Mhm. 
CRUM: And that used to be one of the big things about Opfor 
using their MILES gear and stuff, cheating, you can cheat on 
anything, so, you know.  
SIMS: (laughs)  
CRUM: Take the battery out of it. 
SIMS: Right. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CRUM: (laughs) And then you don’t get hit. But you lose the 
training- 
SIMS: Right.  
CRUM:  Benefit from doing that stuff, so.  
SIMS: So are there other, like if someone is a suicide bomber 
and runs into the middle of a crowd, how does the MILES, and 
blows herself up, like does some, does something go out that 
indicates it to the MILES? Or is it more of an OC- 
CRUM: You’ve got an OC sitting there, or standing there, most of 
the OC’s got what we call God guns, God gun gives life and it 
takes life. It’s got a green key on it, you sit there and do 
this and it’ll set off all them sensors.  
SIMS: Oh, I think I’ve, it’s like a little blue gun. 
CRUM: Mhm. 
SIMS: Basically he would shoot- 
CRUM: Yeah. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SIMS: Yeah. 
CRUM: Yeah. 
SIMS: And so like during that, referee type moment, is like, 
action halted? 
CRUM: Yeah. 
SIMS: Uh-huh. 
CRUM: Oh yeah. Oh yeah, this stops it. If there’s a suicide 
bomber, they’re in, until they assist and it, again, your unit, 
player unit will come in there and assist their casualties, 
figure out if they need to get them ambulatory evacuation, or 
treat them on site or have field medics there or whatever. You 
do an assessment.  And the OC is sitting there, counting, 
checking the marks, checking it off and saying, “Yeah, you did 
this, you did, oh you missed this step, why didn’t you do this?” 
SIMS: Mm-hm. 
CRUM: It will all come out in After Action Review, so. One of 
those things. (laughs) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SIMS: Yeah. 
CRUM: Either you’re good or you aren’t, eh, you’ll hear about 
it.  
SIMS: And did they have, or like, helicopters and airplanes 
ever? Can you tell me about how they’re involved? 
CRUM: Oh, they have MILES equipment on, they go off too, you can 
shoot them down, with small arms fire, whatever. And it beeps 
too, their pilot knows. 
SIMS: Uh-huh.  
CRUM: Oh yeah, you got earphones on just like you do, and you 
can hear it, yeah.  So, it’s- 
SIMS: And what, are the planes on the side of the rotational 
unit? Or are they- 
CRUM: They can be, it depends. You, you’ve got Opfor helicopters 
out there, you got friendly, you know, and, you got fast movers. 
Now, fast movers are fly, they’re doing bomb-and-runs and stuff, 
they’re practicing, they’re not part of the, sometimes they’re 
part of the rotation but normally they’re not.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SIMS: Uh-huh. 
CRUM: So. 
SIMS [0:46:00]: But helicopters aren’t like fighting each other- 
CRUM: No, no, no. They’re going to be inflight. 
SIMS: Right, it’s just that they’re another element. 
CRUM: Right, another element, yeah, yeah. 
SIMS: So, can you, can you give me a sense of like, a typical 
size of, number of soldiers in a rotation unit and then what the 
corresponding like 509th force size- 
CRUM: Oh, it depends on the unit. Again, it’s coming in here to 
train, you know, if it’s the first brigade of whatever, the 
brigade could be up to, what, four, five hundred soldiers. 
509th’s only got, total, whole unit, probably less than 500 
soldiers. I don’t know what total number is out there for them 
now, I’ve been away from it too long. 
SIMS: Mhm. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CRUM: But they might have two platoons that are supporting this 
rotation, with platoons it’s 22 people, 24 people, or 30 people, 
or whatever. And they keep rotating back and forth for 10 days, 
or 12 days, against all the other people. (laughs) Yeah, yeah, 
so.  
SIMS: So basically it’s not as if, if all the 50th were killed- 
CRUM: No, no.  
SIMS: They just get reset. 
CRUM: They’re not all out there at the same time. 
SIMS: Right.  
CRUM: They’ve got special ones that, platoons or whatever that 
they don’t have to support the rotation. And they know ahead of 
time who they gonna be, so they train for it.  
SIMS: So the 509th, does each individual also have a, like, name 
and story, or they- 
CRUM: It depends on what role they’re playing. If they’re out 
there and they’re into the villages and let’s say that they’re a 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
farmer or something there in the village, yeah, they’ll have a 
role.  
SIMS: Mhm. 
CRUM: And their role play sheet tells them, this is what you do, 
this is what you tell them and this, and this is also what you 
do, when you’re, at night, and you have a chance to do this.  
SIMS: Right.  
CRUM: Yeah. 
SIMS: But if you’re just a regular- 
CRUM: Joe, you, you’ll be out there, you’re just, a body in the 
village.  
SIMS: Right. 
CRUM: Yeah. 
SIMS: In terms of the cultural role players, like, where do they 
come fr-, like how are they recruited? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CRUM: They’re part of a contractor. 
SIMS: Uh-huh.  
CRUM: They’re a contractor, the-, they’re vested and checked out 
and all this other good stuff and they’re hired as role players. 
And, I haven’t dealt a whole bunch with them so I don’t know.  
SIMS: Right. 
CRUM: Jack will know more about that than I do because, when I 
was working up there in role play, unless we had a partnership 
for peace, we didn’t deal with any of those, they weren’t doing 
that at that time.  
SIMS: Right.  
CRUM: So, that was after I left, so.  
SIMS: So, how, at the time, how would you all find, part timers, 
was there, was it a contractor as well? 
CRUM [0:49:10]: Yeah, it was contractor, yeah, locally. Fact, a 
lot of people around here, if you go down here and talk to most 
of these people around here, they know somebody was in roleplay 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
or they were a role player. (laughs) Yeah, yeah, so, it’s pretty 
large.  
SIMS: And how would they, would they like advertise for the 
jobs?  
CRUM: Oh yeah.  
SIMS: Like- 
CRUM: Oh yeah, you go out, you interview and all of that other 
good stuff. You sit down and interview, take the application out 
there, and apply to be a role player. So. 
SIMS: So what would be, I guess, reasons why you wouldn’t get 
the job? Is it- 
CRUM: Be a criminal, have a criminal background and can’t pass a 
security check, that’s the biggest reason right there. Or, you 
know, I’ve interviewed people out there that come in, and sit 
down, want to go work for me wearing a bandana and sweat 
dripping off of their, smell and everything else, you come show 
up for an interview, for a job, looking like this- 
SIMS: Right. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CRUM: It ain’t gonna happen, so. It’s, civilians. (laughs)  
SIMS: Is it hard to find, I mean, enough people or, they’re 
turning people away because they can be choosy? 
CRUM: Oh yeah, they can be choosy.  
SIMS: Uh-huh. 
CRUM: Yup. And role players out there, most of them are part 
time. There’s o-, there’s quite a few full-timers now but, 
biggest majority of them are part-timers. They’re on call for 
the rotation. They call them up, say, “Okay, we got a rotation”, 
they had, get them all in there and they say, “Okay, how many 
people can work this rotation every day and this and that, okay, 
this ya’ll, rest of you can go, go home, we’ll call you next 
rotation”. 
SIMS: So, the full timers, what, are they given different types
