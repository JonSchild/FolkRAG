THE GERMAN BAND, 
OR THE DuTCII FLAGEOLET PLAYER. 
Behold a 
paor deluded man, 
A 
victi Ii to deception ; 
Forget WV Woes 1 
nese' can, 
Anil I 
wander in dejection. 
I 
married once a 
nice young girl, 
I'll ne'er forget the more ; 
For ever suite how oft I've wished 
I 
never had been born. 
unoat7s. 
I 
loved and she might have been 
Tho happiest in the land; 
But she fancied a 
foreigner who played a 
flageolet, 
In the middle of a 
German Band. 
She was all my fancy painted her, 
Her name was sweet Susannah ; 
She could sing, she could dance, she could parlezi 
And 'could play upon the grand piann er. 
rn 
ran
scais, 
What a 
blissful honey- moon we spent ! 
To her none have been kinder, 
For I 
male the hod and black- leaded the stove. 
While she played the 
(111sd and 
goa-enGii
 sh e
nder."might, &rt. 
She played all day whilst I 
was away 
A slaving for cash in the city; 
And if any musicians came down the street, 
On them she would take pity. 
So fond of the " f 
ml of love" was she. 
That she made them quite her hobbies, 
She'd often fill the streets with German brass bands, 
Till they ware bundled eitfl utdthaenbd she 
iems.ight, 
&c. 
Now there was a 
German band, three boys and a 
man, 
Who played there every afternoon ; 
They played a 
flageolet in C cornopean in D 
With a 
sackbut and trombone out of tune; 
They made an awful row, but still anyhow 
They wilt.) charmeii the heart of Susannah, 
For she'd sit at the window, whilst the German flageolet 
Used to wink in a 
most improper manner. 
I 
loved, and she might, &c. 
. 
4 
Such goings on were not quite right, 
And so I 
gently told her : 
And though with rage Ins, buzzum burned, 
I'd not the heart to scold her. 
The very next day, when I 
reached home. 
You might have knocked me down with a 
brick, sirs. 
She'd ran away with the German flageolet, 
And sold every blessed stick. sirs. 
I 
loved, and she might, &c. 
Now this happy loving couple did not love long, 
For ere they were a 
fortnight older, 
They had a 
jolly row, when the German flageolet 
Went and ' listed for a 
Yankee soldier. 
On the field of glory he got shot in the back, 
But 
should I 
now be caring ? 
For the foreign ragamuffin he's a 
clay cold corpus, 
And Susannah has got to go out ('baring. 
I 
loved and she might, &c. 
CAPTAIN =ICS OF THE HORSE MARINES. 
As sung by the GREAT LINGARD. 
I

I

I 
sport young ladies in their teens, 
To cut a 
swell in the army. 
I

How to dance, how to dance, 
I

For I'm their pet in the army. 
Po.—Ha! ha! ha 
CHORUS. 
I'm Cap-tain Jinks of the Horse Marinee, 
I 
give my horse good corn and beans; 
Of course its quite beyond my moans, 
Tho' a

I 
joined my corps when twenty-one, 
Of course I 
thought it capital fun, 
When the enemy came then off I 
run, 
I 
was'nt cut out for the army, 
When I 
left home mama she cried, 
Mama she cried, mama she cried, 
When I 
left home mama she cried, 
" 
He aiut cut out for the army." 
SPOKEN—Ns, she thought I 
was too young, but then, I •aid, 
ah 1 
mama, 
I'm Captain Jinks of the Horse Marines, Zikl 
The first day I 
went out to drill, 
The bugle sound made me quite ill, 
At the Balance step my hat it fell, 
And that wouldn't do for the army. 
The officers they all did shout. 
They all cried out, they all did shout, 
The officers they all did shout, 
" 
Oh that's the curse of the army." 
SPoKEN.—Of course my hat did fall off, but ah 1 
neverttlAless. 
I'm Captain Jinks of the Horse Marines, .te. 
My Tailor's bills came in so fasts 
Forced me ono day to leave at last,. 
ITALIAN GUINEA PIG BOY. 
And ladies too no more did cast, 
Shcep's eyes at me in the army. 
My creditors at me did shout, 
At me did shout, at me did shout, 
My creditors at me did shout, 
" 
Why kick him out of the army."

perhaps you are not aware, that, 
I'm Captain Jinks of the Horse Marines, &e.

As sung by the GREAT LINGARD.

And mine little sister cry, when I

OR, THE CALICO PRINTER'S CLERK. 
In Manchester, that city 
Of cotton, twist, and twills, 
Lived the subject of my ditty, 
And the cause of all my ills; 
She was handsome, young, and twenty, 
Her eyes were azure blue, 
Admirers she had plenty, 
And her name was Dorothy Drew. 
CHORUS. 
She was very fond of dancing, _ 
But allow me to remark, 
That one fine day she danced away, 
With a 
calico plinter s 
clerk. 
At a 
private ball I 
met her, 
In eighteen sixty-three, 
I 
never can forget her, 
Though she was unkind to me; 
I 
was dressed in pink of fashion, 
My lavender gloves were new, 
I 
danced the valse Circassian, 
With charming Dorothy Drew. 
She was very, ac. 
We schottisch'd and we po7ka'd, 
To the strains the band did play, 
We valsed and we niazourka'd, 
Till she valsed my heart away; 
I 
whispered in this manner, 
As round the room we flew, 
Doing varsoviana, 
I 
love you, Dorothy Drew. 
She was very, Etc. 
For months and months attention 
Unto her I 
did pay, 
Till with her condecension 
She led me quite astray ; 
The money I 
expended, 
I'm ashamed to tell to you, 
inform you how it ended 
With myself and Dorothy Drew. 
She was very, 45te. 
I 
received an intimation 
She a 
visit meant to pay, 
Unto a 
near relation, 
Who lived some miles away, 
In a 
month she'd be returning, 
I 
must take a 
short adieu, 
But her love for me was burning, 
Deceitful Dorothy Drew. 
She was very, Arr.. 
At nine o'clock next morning, 
To breakfast I 
sat down, 
The smile my face adorning 
Was soon changed to a

Had married Miss Dorothy Drew.

THE MABEL WALTZ. 
As Sung by TONY PASTOR. 
I 
once did know a 
pretty girl, 
She dressed so very neat; 
She used to run a 
sewing-machine, 
Down in Chatham Street. 
Her eyes were bright, complexion light, 
Her cheeks were like the rose; 
She'd a 
dimpled chin, and pouting lips, 
And a 
beautiful turn-up nose. 
I 
never can forget the night 
I 
met her at a 
ball: 
'Twas a 
fancy hop, a 
dollar a 
head, 
Up at Irving Hall. 
CHORUS. 
She looked so neat, I 
never thought she ever would prove false; 
Her step was light as the bounding fawn, dancing the Mabel 
Waltz. 
I 
often met her after that, 
Of tender things we talked; 
And, every Sunday out of two, 
I'd take her out to walk. 
I 
bought her lots of diamonds, 
At a-dollar-jewelry store, 
And also bought her a 
new silk-dress, 
Which every day she wore. 
In buying presents for that girl, 
I 
all my money spent, 
Until I 
found myself dead broke, 
And I 
hadn't got a 
cent. 
[CuoRus. 
And, then, I 
thought 'tw as getting time 
The question for to pop. 
I 
went one day dressed in ray best, 
Straight down to the shop: 
She didn't come; I 
asked the cause, 
And learned from one Miss Brown 
My charmer had, that very day, 
Just gone out of town. ' 
Judge my feelings when Miss Brown 
These cruel words let slip: 
It's my opinion she s 
gone off 
Upon her wedding trip. 
[CHoRtrs. 
" WALKING DOWN BROADWAY.'f 
And when a 
year had passed away, 
At a 
window I 
did see 
My fair, but false one, sitting 
With a 
baby on her knee. 
I 
quickly marched into the house, 
And, there, what met my view I 
'Twas a 
tall Policeman, six feet high, 
He was her husband, too 1 
He collared me, and then commenced 
A 
series of assaults, 
I 
never chassez'd it so fast before, 
While dancing the Mabel Waltz. [CrioRuB. 
WALKING DOWN BROADWAY." 
Sung by the GREAT LINGARD. 
The sweeteet thing in life 
And no one dare say nay, 
On a 
Saturday afternoon, 
Is walking down Broadway. 
My sisters, thro' the Park 
And at Long Branch wish to stay, 
But / prefer to walk 
Down the festive, gay Broadway. 
Walking (
low, Broadway— walking down Broadway— 
The 0. K. thing on Saturday is walking down Broadway. 
Walking down Broadway—the festive, gay Broadway; 
The 0 K thing on Saturday, is walking down Broadway. 
Last Wednesday afternoon 
My cousin Will did say, 
"Nellie, come along with me, 
I'll take you down Broadway, 
To the Theatre Comiqt.e, 
To see Captain Jinks so gay; 
Then we'll dine at Delmonico's, 
'Fore returning down Broadway." 
DIALOGLTE.—And I 
must say ladies and gentlemen, with all 
due deference to other pleasures in life, there's nothing so 
charming as—

As I 
waved my new bandana to

When I 
sailed for Singapore. 
Good bye. John, now don't stop long, 
But come back soon to your own Chickabiddy, 
For my heart beats so, when the winds do blow 
That takes away my sailor. 
Sweet Nancy was a 
lass, my boys, 
Of fifteen stone full weight. 
Her face—it was a 
face, my boys, 
Like a 
good sized dinner plate; 
She kept a 
candy-shop, my boys, 
'I would your eyes do good to see, 
Sold lollypop& and Tom Thumb's drops, 
But nought so sweet as she.

She look'd like a

She wagg'd her tail at me, my boys! 
And then she shook her head, 
Then seemed to speak in fishy tones 
And this is what she said, 
Good bye, John, et.4. 
Our gallant craft reacled home, my boys. 
Next day to come on board, 
My Nance put off in a

Her John whom she ador'd.

THE ROYAL WILD BEAST SHOW.--[CoNcLumm] 
The first one is the kangaroo, you'll know him by his hump; 
The next's the hippopotamus, you ought to see him jump; 
The third's the alligator and he's such a 
one to crow, 
Ile wakes us every morning in the Royal Wild Beast Show. 
The camomiles, &c. 
That pretty thing's the oozley bird, the other one's his aunt, 
The third we call the pelican, the next the pelicant; 
The other one's the solon goose-you musn't call out bo! 
Or you will hurt his feelings in the Royal Wild Beast Show. 
The eamomiles, & e. 
The donkey in the corner with the tiger on his arm, 
Comes from Assyria, where once his father kept a 
farm; 
That billy-goat that's dress'd in pink and walking rather slow, 
Is very hornimental in a 
Royal Wild Beast Show. 
The camomiles, &c. 
The tortoise, famous for his speed, unequal'd by a 
horse; 
The parrot, too, who talks in poily-syllables, of course ; 
The raging elephants that roar when stormy winds do blow, 
Are also represented in the Royal Wild Beast Show. 
The camorniles, &e. 
The next one is a 
mighty ape, indeed, I 
tell von true, 
It's only natural he should " go walking in the Zoo ;" 
Our stock of monkeys, you'll observe, at present is but low-
They are so plentiful outside the Royal Wild Beast Show. 
The camomiles, &e. 
The last's the boa constrictor, who eats all he finds about-
Why, who's been fool enough to let the nasty crittur out ? 
He's somewhere underneath the chairs, hi I 
mind 3, our legs, 
hullo I 
He's very quick hi cleaiing out the Royal Wild Beast Show.

CROSSING ON THE FERRY. 
Oh ! please don't laugh w 
ben I 
relate 
r10 you a 
story sweet: 
It's all about a 
charming- girl 
That 1 
by chance did meet. 
'Twas love at first sight when we met, 
Those lips so red and cherry. 
Oh! what a 
stunning girl it was, 
That I 
met on the ferry. 
CII ORIIS. 
Walking through the cabin, passing all the style. 
Smiling on the fair sex, hours to beguile, 
Nothing yet can cheer me, ; for, I 
can't be merry, 
Since I 
met that little dear crossing on the ferry. 
I 
scarcely knew which way to look; 
For, she a 
magnet seemed ; 
Electric sparks I 
thought I 
felt, 
So bright her eyes they beamed; 
For, every glance was like a 
lance, 
As in my ht:art they'd bury : 
Until I 
felt, I 
scarce know Low, 
While crossing on the ferry. 
Walking through the cabin, ege. 
Our journey's end at last approached, 
My heart beat slow and last, 
While passengers ran here and there, 
My love among them passed. 
She turned her bead and spoke to me. 
In a 
voice so soft and merry, 
Saying: Write a 
note to Station D. 
Sign, Crossing on the ferry.

STrAN'T I 
BE GLAD WHEN SALLY COMES HOME 
Oh i 
I've been so sad for a 
very long time, 
I 
thought I'd lost that girl of mine, 
Who really is an angel divine, 
And I 
have her absence been mourning. 
Oh, yes through her I've been made very ill, 
To her ' twas a 
trouble to keep her hand still, 
Through which she got six months on the treadmill, 
But she's coming out in the morning. 
CIIORUS. 
Oh I 
shan't I 
be glad when Sally comes home 
'When Sally comes home, when Sally comes home ! 
Shan't I 
be glad when Sally corn, s 
home! 
For she's coming out in the morning I 
Now Sally she is a 
young feminine fair, 
She was to me beyond compare, 
I 
much admire her carroty hair, 
For she scorns the use of a 
chignon. 
Her father sold baked tuna in a 
tin can, 
Her brother he was a 
fat six foot policeman, 
Her mother worked hard at the tub, pail and pan, 
And gained every one's good opinion. 
Om ! shan't I 
be glad, Itc, 
Now Sally she was her mamma's fondest pet, 
But unluckily, one day she mil, 
A 
friend of hers, called 
light-fineercd Bet," 
A 
girl much addicted to cheating. 
They walked in a 
lin ge draper's shop one fine day 
To buy some smart ribbons and flowers so gay, 
When Sally was seen walking quickly away 
With twenty-four yards of white sheeting. 
Oh ! shan't I 
be glad. Ara 
The shopman on her all the time had his eye, 
And called a 
bobby then standing by, 
Though Sarah she for mercy did cry, 
lie soon walked her off to the station. 
They took her before the Judge on that day, 
A 
most shocking bad case it was, he did say, 
So r 
six long months he sent Sally away, 
To be boarded and lodged by the nation. 
Oh! shan't I 
be glad, Itc. 
But courage and strength I'll endeavor to show, 
And set aside all signs of woe, 
From gaol to church we quickly will go, 
When they let her go out in tl:e morning. 
And when charming Sally beeames nis dear wife, 
We'll soon put an end to all trimble and strife, 
And, happily leading a 
good honest life, 
We'll set an example and warning. 
Oh I 
sImn't I

WHERE THERE'S A WILL, THERE'S A WAY. 
This life is a 
difficult riddle : 
For, how many people we see. 
With faces as long as a 
fiddle, 
That ought to look shining with glee? 
I 
am sure, in this world, there are plenty, 
Of good things, enough for us all; 
And yet, there's tiA one out of twenty, 
But thinks that his share is too small. 
cnonus: 
Then, what is the use of repining? 
For, where there's a 
will, there's a 
Way, 
And to-morrow the sun may be shining, 
Although it is cloudy to-day. 
Did you never hear tell of the spider. 
That tried up the wall hard. to climb ? 
If not, just take that as a 
guider: 
You'll find it will serve you, in time: 
Nine times, it tried hard to be mounting, 
And, every time, it stuck fast; 
But it tried hard again, without counting, 
And, of course, it succeedel, at last. 
t

et. 
what is, ogr.,c. 
Some grumble, because they are not married, 
And cannot procure a 
good wife: 
Whilst others, they wish they had tarried, 
And long for a 
bachelor's life. 
To me it is very bewilderin' : 
Some grumble, ( it must be in fun, ) 
Because they have too many children: 
And others, because they have none. 
Then what is, crtc. 
Do you think that, by sitting and sighing, 
You'll ever obtain all you want ? 
It's cowards alone that are crying. 
And foolishly saying; " I 
can't I" 
It's only by plodding and striving, 
And labouring up the steep bill. 
Of life, that you'll ever be thriving ; 
Which you'll do, if you've only the will.

THERE'S NO SUCH GIRL AS MINE. 
There's no such girl as mine, 
In all this wide world round, 
With her hair of gold so fine 
And her voice of silver sound ! 
Her eyes are as black as the sloe, 
Her lips in a 
smile combine, 
Her breath is as pure as the snow. 
There's no such girl as mine 
CHORUS. 
Oh there's no such girl as mine, ' 
In all this wide world round, , 
With her hair of gold so fine, 
And her voice of silver sound 
Oft her soul in sweetness flows, 
She's gainer of all hearts; 
There's a

And a 
sigh when she departs t

She is free from all dark design, 
She's welcome at every door: 
There's no such girl as mine ! 
Oh I 
there's no such girl, &e. 
She is light to the banquet hall, 
She's balm to the couch of care; 
When around us troubles fall, 
She calmly takes her share; 
At home or when far away, 
Her virtues will ever shine; 
Her heart is as open as day: 
There's no such girl as mine! 
Oh! there's no such girl, &c.

With spools of thread for fishing-lines,

They, always, wished in vain;

STANDING ON THE PLATFORM. 
Going down to Long Branch, one fine day, 
I 
chanced to miss the train ; 
I 
turned my head around, and there I 
saw, 
A sight which turned my brain. 
For there I 
saw a 
charming. girl, 
The prettiest I'd ever seen: 
Her voice was sweet, her dress was neat, 
She was a 
fairy queen. 
Spoken.— Yes, she was the prettiest creature that I'd ever met 
In the whole course of my existence, and I 
considered myself very 
lucky that I 
happened to be— 
C11011U3. 
Standing on the platform, waiting for the train, 
I 
met this darling girl, who winked at me so plain: 
Bright blue eyes so sparkling, teeth were pearly white, 
She was just the pink of fashion, and just the girl you'd like. 
Pray, sir, can you tell mc how long the train will be, 
Said I, " 
ask the guard," 
"I thank you for your kindness, sir ?" said she 
And looked at me so hard; 
We waited but a 
little while, 
For the train it soon was there, 
And then into one of the cars, 
I 
banded this lady fair. 
Spoken.— I 
was sorry to part with her, but she had to go ono 
way, I 
had to go the other, and of course, I 
couldn't detain her 
all day, a— 
Standing on the platform, ctc 
She kissed her hand to me, and said, " Dear sir, 
Farewell, till next we meet." 
And oh! the look she gave me as the train went off, 
I 
assure you was a 
treat; 
Yet oh ! some day, I 
hope to meet, 
This charming creature divine, 
And when I 
do, I'll tell you all, 
About this love of mine.

THE Pr../2 GI" TIE GIRLS AM I. 
Words by G EO. COOPER. 
Music by W. F. W ELL, 
Up and down the gay Broadway T 
go, 
Quite distingue in my dress and air ; 
All the la lies 1. ok at me I 
know, 
I'm got up with the greatest care ! 
All the tailors like me for a 
s'g,n, 
Everything about me is the st:‘ le ; 
Nothing coarse, of course, is in my line, 
A shining light from boots to " tile!" 
SroxEs.—Yaas ! weally ! 1 
don't see how it is, but I'm 
gweatly admired. 
I 
suppose though it's because—

CHORUS. 
The T 
et of the girls am 1, 
I'm happy to own it's the case, 
I 
make all their pretty hearts sigh, 
Don't you wish that you were in my place ? 
All the fellows they envy my lot, 
When I 
meet them at the club, you see ; 
But they haven't got the style I've got, 
Though everybody copies me! 
Gay moustache all t 
w 
isted to a 
hair, 
Dainty ringlets falling on my brow, 
Lots of friends and lots of cash to spare, 
I'm good for all except a 
wrow ! 
SPOKEN. — A wrow! 
Why ! it makes me shudder! 
Sup-
pose I 
should get a 
discolored optic ? 
That would never do, 
for you see— 
The pet of the girls, &e. 
I'm a 
butterfly please to observe 
And I 
flourish where the v.-roses grow; 
As for smoking, haven't got the nerve: 
My cane it weally tires me so 
On the street you'll find me any day, 
Kids and neck--!*,s 
are my swtet delight. 
0, to be a 
swell 
wr-rdy gay, 
pwartico it both tilt' ann! 
SPOTiEN.—If T 
didn't how could I get myself up in aim

PADDLE YOUR OWN CANOE, NO. L 
travell'd about a 
bit in my time. 
And of troubles I've seen a 
few, 
But found it better, in ey'ry clime, 
To Fiddle my own canoe. 
My wants are small, I 
care not at all 
If my debts are paid when due; 
I 
drive away strife, in the ocean of life, 
While I 
paddle my own canoe. 
CHORUS. 
Then love your neighbor as yourself, 
As the world you go travelling through, 
And never sit down, with a 
tear or a 
frown, 
But paddle your own canoe. 
I 
have no wife to bother my life, 
Nor lover to prove untrue; 
But the whole day long, with a 
laugh and a 
song, 
I 
paddle my own canoe. 
I 
rise with the lark, and from daylight till dark, 
I 
do what I 
have to do. 
I'm careless of wealth, if I've only the health 
To paddle my own canoe. 
Then love your, &c.„ 
It's all very well to depend on a 
friend, 
That is: if you've proved him true; 
But y•u'll find it better, by far in the end, 
To paddle your own ganoe. 
To BORROW is dearer, by far, than to BUY, 
A maxim, tho' old, still true; 
You never will sigh, if you only will try 
To paddle your own canoe 
Then love your, tt,o. 
If a 
hurricane rise, in the mid-day skies, 
And the sun is lost to view, 
Move steadily by, with a 
steadfast eye, 
And paddle your own canoe. 
The daisies that grow in the bright green fields, 
Are blooming so sweet for you, 
So, never sit down, with a 
tear or a 
frown, 
But paddle your own canoe. 
Then love your, &A. 
THE OLD PLAY-GROUND. 
I'm sitting to-day in the old play-ground, 
Where you and I 
have sat so oft together ; 
I'm thinking of the joys when you and l 
were boys, 
In the merry days now ,one, John, forever. 
'Twas here we sat in the merry olden time, 
And we dreamed of the wide world before us, 
And our visions and hopes of the coming time, 
Were as bright as the sun which shone o'er us.

O'er this threshold, John, we passed forlorn, 
To ‘vander we knew not where ; 
The heaven we thought, so bright was o'crshadowed 
by night,

But I'm sitting to-day in the ()Id play-.,•round,

STAR OF THE TWILIGHT. 
Star of the twilight, beautiful star!

Looks the lone traveller o'er the dark sea,

Light thou his pathway, beautiful star!

NOT FOR JOSEPH. 
I've seen a 
bit of gaiety throughout my short career, 
once, was foolish with my tin. but I've paid most dear, 
If folks would seek to take me in, they find it is no go; 
I'm up to almost every thing: You can't get over Joe. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! dear, no! not for Joe—if he knows it—not for Joseph. 
Oh! no, no! not for Joe—not for Joseph—oh! dear, no! 
The other day, I 
met a 
friend, we passed the time of day, 
And chatted gaily down Broadway : but ere I 
went away, 
I 
kindly asked the learned swell to take a 
parting drain, 
Oh ! yes, said he, I 
think I 
will : then let it be champagne. 
Spoken.—No, you don't, my dear fellow, you don't get 
champagne out of Joseph. 
Oh I 
dear, no, not &c. 
Some time ago, a 
friend of mine, he asked me out to dine, -
And there he introduced me to one he called divine: 
He said she'd make a 
charming wife, and had such lots of tin: 
A. widow only -forty-two: go in, my boy, and win. 
Spoken.—Matrimony and lots of money, and a 
widow only 
forty-two—well, the money is very good, but then—the widow. 
Oh! dear, no, not! &c. 
Of late, in town, there was a 
fuss about the Japs so grand: 
And, also, of the Russians who visited our land, 
And the country-companies we greeted with hearty cheers, 
We know they have been received well by the New York 
Volunteers. 
Spoken.- -What a 
glorious thing it is to fight and die for 
your country ! 
What can be more glorious than a 
bullet in 
your eve? What can be more painful than a 
bullet in the 
eye ? 
Nothing I 
should think— 
Oh! dear, no, not I &c. 
And now, perhaps, I've sung my song, you might be in the 
cue, 
To show you kind acknowledgement, but that with me won't 
do, 
As for to-night I've done my best, and that you ought to know: 
'au, if you want a 
song again, don't try it on with Joe I 
Oh I 
dear, Ito, not t 
eto. 
NO ONE TO LOVE. 
No one to love, none to ,caress, 
It ,aming alone through this world's wilderness; 
Sad is my heart, joy is unknown; 
For, in my sorrow, I'm weeping alone, 
.No gentle voiee, no tender smile 
Makes me rejoice, or cares beguile. 
CHORUS. 
No one to love, none to caress, 
Roaming alone through this world's wilderness, 
Sad is my heart, joy is unknown; 
For, in my sorrow, I'm weeping alone. 
!In dreams alone, loved ones I 
see, 
And well-known voices then whisper to ma: 
;Sighing I 
wake, waking I 
weep; 
Soon with the loved and the lost I 
shall sleep, 
Oh! blissful rest ! what heart would stay 
,Unloved, unbless'd, from Heaven away. 
one to love, 4ro., 
"So one to love, none to caress, 
None to respond to this heart's tenderness, 
Trusting I 
wait; God, in his love, 
Promises rest in his mansions above, 
Oh! bliss in store! oh! joy mine own! 
There never more to weep alone! 
No one to love, &c.

331ARY OF THE wELD MOOR. 
'it was on one cold winter's night, 
As the wind blew across the wild moor, 
When Mary came :wandering home with her babto 
Till she came to her own father's door. 
Oh, father, dear father, she cried, 
Come down and open the door, 
Or this .ohild in ,:ny arms will perish and. die, 
By the wind that blows across the wild moor. 
• 
Oh, why did I 
leave this dear spot, 
Where ,once I 
was happy and free? 
Mut now, Aloomed to roam without friends or home, 
And no one to take pity-en-me. 
The old man was -deaf to her cries; 
Not a 
sound of her voice reached his ear; 
But the watch-dog did bowl, and the village bell ton, 
And the wind blew across the ,wild moor. 
33ut how must the old man have felt, 
When he came to the door in the morn. 
Toor Mary was dead, but the child was alive, 
Closely pressed in its dead mother's arms. 
Half frantic he tore his gray hair, 
And the tears down his cheeks they did pour, 
Saying, this cold winter's night, she perished and Ilea, 
By the wiud that blew across the wild -moor, 
The old man in grief pined away, 
And the child to its mother went soon; 
And no one they say, has lived there to this day, 
And the cottage to ruin has gene, 
'The villagers point out the spot, 
Where the willow droops over the door, 
saying, there Mary died, once a 
gay village bride, 
the wind that blows across the wild moor!

Our happy time away.

THAT'S 0I7T. 
With laughter and good humor, why, 
I 
pass my time away, 
So, while I'm here l'll do my best 
To please you. with my lay. 
Then, conic along and join my song, 
And raise a

To welcome me: for, l'm you see,

Now then, young men, 
Don't be melancholy: 
Just see, like me, 
If you can't be jolly: 
If any thing goes wrong with me„ 
I 
never sulk or pout: 
In fact, I 
am, and always was, 
The merriest girl that's out 
The gentlemen complain and say; 
I'm such a 
dreadful flirt: 
But if they -will make love to me, 
Their hearts I'm sure to hurt— 
I 
really can't help laughing, 
When I 
hear them sigh about; 
For sentiment it don't suit me ; 
I'm the merriest girl that's out. 
Now then, &s. 
The notes and presents I 
receive, 
Would fill a 
basket quite, 
'While bouquets rare, I 
do declare, 
Are sent me every night. 
The notes all speak of broken hearts: 
$‘..zoine nielin it, l've no doubt; 
I'm sorry : yet I 
still remain 
The merriest girl that's out, 
sow, then, &a. 
To balls and parties I 
oft go: 
For, dancing I 
admire, 
And waltzing is a 
thing, I 
own, 
Of which I 
never tire; 
And should my partner squeeze ttly har.d,

know what I'm about: 
It pleases him, and don't hurt Ice: 
I'm the merriest.girl that's out.

The clock had just struck eight,

She was standing by the garden-gate.

Mav I

She murmured: If you choose. 
I

To her style there is no end, 
And, of course, she must look dashing; 
For, she wears a

Most every one supposes; 
For, as dear as life is my little wife:

LITTLE MAGGIE MAY. 
The Spring bad come, the flowers 
The birds sung out their lay; 
Down by a 
little running brook, 
I 
first saw Maogie May: 
She had a 
roguish jet-black eye, 
Was singing all the day : 
And how I 
loved her! none can tell, 
My little Maggie May. 
CHORUS. 
in bloom, 
My little witching Maggie, 
Maggie sin ring all the day.. 
Oh! how I 
love her! none can tell, 
My little Maggie May. 
Though years rolled on. yet still I 
loved 
With heart so light and gay, 
And never will this heart deceive 
My own dear Maggie May. 
When others thought that life was gone 
And death would take away, 
Still by my side did linger one. 
And that was Maggie May. 
My little witching, &c. 
May Heaven protect me for her sake: 
I 
pray, both night and day, 
That I 
ere long may call her mine, 
My own dear Maggie May. 
For, she is all the world to me, 
Although I'm far away : 
I 
oftimes think of the running brook, 
And my little Magge May. 
My little witching, &C. 
KISSING THROUGH THE BARS. 
'Twas in a 
grove I 
met my love, 
One soft and balmy night, 
I 
owned my flame. she did the same, 
And trembled with delight. 
When at her gate we parted late, 
I 
blessed my lucky stars, 
And stole a 
kiss to sial our bliss 
Between the wicket bars. 
I 
went again, but sought in vain 
The grove toy love to find, 
I 
feared the worst, and yet I 
thirst 
Not think she was unkind. 
To solve my fate, I 
sought the gate, 
And there, oh, happy stars, 
I 
found and press' l 
her to my breast 
And kissed her through the bars. 
I 
asked her why she did not fly, 
Like me, on wings of love, 
To where our vows beneath the boughs 
Were whispered through the bars. 
She said, of late, the garden gate 
Seemed nearer to the stars. 
The hint was plain, and so again 
I 
kissed her through the bars. 
But kissing leads to graver deeds, 
And constant visions brings 
Of golden showers and orange flowers, 
White gloves and wedding rings. 
And now our fate, no envions gate, 
With wicked, wicket mars, 
For wedded fast, we've learned at last ) 
To kiss without the bars. 
ALONE FROM HOME. 
Alone and from home, friendless and poor, 
how many sorrows and slights we endure ; 
Anxious I 
look for one face that I 
know, 
Watching the crowd as they passed to and fro, 
Some look upon me-with sorrowful eve, 
And drop a 
kind word as they quickly pass by: 
While others bestow but a 
cold glance of scorn, 
Nor pity the str..nger so sad and forlorn. 
ctionus. • 
Sadly I 
wander by day and by night, 
Counting the moments in Time's rapid flight, 
No one will care for me whether I 
roam, 
A poor weary stranger, alone and from home. 
Alone and from home, weary, oppressed, 
No one to welcome me, nowhere to rest, 
Where may I 
pillow my poor aching head, 
Who will weep over me when I 
ant dead? 
The night falls around me cheerless and still. 
The dew-drops upon me, so damp and so chill; 
"Its then that I 
long for the coming of day, 
For then the dark shadows will all pass away. 
Sadly I 
wander, ko

IS NOT THE MILES WE TRAVEL) BUT 
THE PACE THAT KILLS. 
As we jog along the Road of Life we pass a 
load 
Of discontented mortals who have gme too fast; 
Forfeiting their health, 
In the modern race for wealth, 
Until compl . tely beaten they break down at last; 
But others slow and sure, 
The journey can enduie, 
Altho' the road is rugged with its dales and hills, 
They ou ,rht to bear in mind, 
In life they'll always find, 
It's not the miles they travel but he pace that kills. 
CHORUS. 
Remember what I 
say, if ycn wish to pay your way, 
And not be troubled day and night with duns and bills, 
Don't travel on too fast, 
Or you may break down at last, 
For it's not the miles we travel but the pace that kills. 
I'll tell you in my song how it is I 
get along„ 
So easily and merrily on life's highway ; 
For riches I 
ne'er fret, 
And I 
don't run into debt, 
So I 
never find it difficult my bills to pay, 
I 
never rail at fate, 
I 
envy not the great, 
Employment keeps me healthy, and good temper keeps 
me gay, 
I 
know that labor's sweet, 
So I 
earn before I 
eat, 
And that's the way to travel, boys, on life's highway. 
Remember what, &c. 
If fortune won't be kind at first, why never mind, 
Keep boldly trudging on, but not too fast, 
Take both good and bad 
As it comes, and don't be sad. 
If you only persevere you'll reach the goal at last, 
And if your fare is coarse, 
Think it might have been much worse, 
So travel on contented and don't despise 
The man that's slow and steady, 
Always watching— always ready, 
ts the man to win the race for wealth, and gain the 
prize. l  
Remember what, &c. . 
I COULDN'T HELP LAUGHING, IT. 
TICKLED ME SO. 
From morning till night I'm indulging in mirth, 
I've always been so from the day of my birth; 
I 
grin like a 
Maltese cat all thro' each day, 
And never feel right unless laughing away. 
My infantile actions were certainly wild— 
All folks said I 
was a 
most wonderful chill; - 
And when first short- coated, I'd have you to know, 
I 
couldn't help laughing, it tickled me so. 
CITORUs. 
IIa! hal ha! ha! ho! ho! ho! hot 
I 
couldn't help laughing, it tickled me so. 
And when, by degrees, I 
had reached man's estate, 
I 
then looked about in search of a 
mate, 
My eyes soon I 
set on a 
girl tall and fair, 
And begg'd that my heart and my home she would share, 
And while so persistently urging my claim, 
She gave her consent, and at last the day came ; 
But, when in the morning to ehurch we did go, 
I 
couldn't help laughing, it tickled me so. 
I'm fond of a 
game, I'm a 
good one to chaff; 
At all kinds of mischief I'm certain to laugh; 
I 
oft play a 
lark on sotne innocent elf, 
Nor care though the laugh should be turned 'gainst myself. 
I 
once, walking out, saw a 
man in a 
fit, 
To make him come round I 
his ear quickly bit ; 
And when he jumped up, knock d 
me down with one blow. 
I 
couldn't help laughing, it tickled me so. 
Ha, ha, etc. 
My landlord once called for his two quarters' rent, 
But I 
couldn't pay it because it was spent ; 
So off to a 
broker he went very quick, 
And vowed he would seize upon every stick. 
Before he could get back, I 
gave hint leg 
For I 
shot the moon, but got caught, put in jail ; 
And tho' plac'd iii" limbo" for what I 
did owe, 
4, - 
I 
couldn't help laughing, it tickled me so. 
Ha, ha, etc. 
Three times in succession my partner had twins— 
y 
place to look like a 
small school- room begins; 
Throughout, all the day there is notlting but glee, 
For all of them have laughing fits just like mc 
The last time, to add to our family joys, 
To me three presented, a 
girl and two boys ; 
Whet I 
saw the three cherubs all of a 
row, 
I 
couldn't help laughing, it tickled me so. 
ha, ha, etc. 
Ha, ha, etc.

THE GAMBLER'S WIFE. 
Poetry by Dr. Crofts.—Music by Henry Russel. 
Dark is the night; how dark! no light—no fire! 
Cold on the earth the last faint sparks expire ; 
Shiv'ring, she watches by the cradle side, 
For Idol who pledged his love—last year a 
bride! 
Hark ! ' tis his footstep !—No, 'tis past—'tis gone 1 
Tic ! tic ! how wearily the time rolls on. 
Why should he leave me thus? he once was kind, 
And I 
believ'd % would last—oh! how mad, how blind! 
Rest thee, my babe, rest on,—'tis hunger's cry I 
Sleep for there is no food; the fount is dry ! 
Famine and cold their wearing work have done; 
My heart must break—and thou my child !— 
Hush! the cluck strikes one! 
/lush ! 'tis the dice-box,—yes! he's there—he's there 
For this he leaves me to despair ; 
Leaves love—leaves truth—his wife—his child—for what? 
The gambler's fancied bliss—the rtmbler's horrid lot 1 
Yet, 
not curse him,—no : 'tis all in vain; 
'Tis long to wait, but sure he'll come again ; 
And I 
could starve and bless him, but, my child, for y 
Oh, fiend I 
oh, fiend I—Hush ! the clock strikes two! 
Hark ! how the slon board creaks—the blast howls by. 
Moan, moan, ye winds through the cloudy sky. 
11;1! 'tis his knock ! he comes, he collies once more ; 
No, 'tis but the lattice-tlaps—my hope is o'er 1 
Can he desert us thus ? he knows I 
stay, 
Night after night, in loneliness to pray 
For his return, and yet he s-es no tear ; 
No, no, it cannot be—oh ! he will be here, 
Nestle more closely, dear one, to my heart 
Thou art cold—thou art freezing— but we will not part— 
Husband— I !— Father—it is not he, 
O 
God ! protect my child—Hush— the clock strikes three— 
They're gone—the .-,,
Iirninerintt, spark bath fled— 
The wife and child are number'd with the dead ; 
On the cold earth, outstretchd in solemn rest, 
The babe lies frozen on its mother's breast— 
The gambler comes at last, but all is o'er,— 
Dread silence reigns around—the cluck strikes four— 
THE GRECIAN BEND. 
As sung by the GRHAT LINCIAID• ; 
Good evening to you one and all, 
I 
hope I 
don't intrude, 
Dressed in this quiet fashion, 
Pray do not think me rude. 
I 
always study " Le Follet," 
The fashion to amend; 
So I 
introduce you, ladies, too, 
This graceful Grecian Bend. 
CHORUS. 
The Grecian Bend, as I 
now show, 
You must admit is all the go. 
The head well forward, and the body you extend, 
To 
be perfect in the Grecian Bend. 
'Twas raining hard the other day, 
So I 
got into a 
stage, 
Some little boys began to shout, 
Which put mein a 
rage. 
The driver, too, said, " Really, Miss, 
You've room enough for ten," 
And actually charged me double, 
On account J my Grecian Bend. 
SPOKEN :—I 
wouldn't mind it so much only there was An 
Jenkins, who lives next door to me, in the same stage, she begs 
to laugh at me, she's been practicing the Grecian Bend fc 
three weeks, but she can't do it, she's jealous of me because 
took her young man away. One gent had the audacity to te 
me that the Greci tri Bend was nothing more or less than 
spasmodic movement of the third rib in connection with O. 
left shoulder. In fact I 
need not tell you that—

She's bare-footed and pretty, she's lively and witty, 
She sines her wild songs to the murrmiring sea, 
She'll dance on the sand where the fisherman stands, 
And join in the music of a 
wild swelling glee. 
She sits in her boat and sings o'er thz billow, 
And flirts with the spray like a 
sea skimming gull ; 
She laughs at the winds whose revels are music, 
And beats to the time with the stroke of her scull.—Cho.

To see pretty Sarah, the pride of the sea, 
Who's going to be married next Sunday to me; 
Her hair I 
will deck with a 
wreath of bright sea weed ; 
I'll plant in her bosom a 
blooming moss rose : 
She shall go like a 
fay with sweet tinkling music, 
With rim on her fingers and bells on her tr.z1.—Cho.
