OLD HANNAH
Go down, ol' Hannah, well, well, well, don't you rise no more, Go down, ol' Hannah, don't
you rise no more, If you rise in the morning, bring judgment on, I ain't tired of living but I
got so long.
My mama called me, well, well, well, and I answered “ma'am”, And I answered, “Ma'am,
ain't you tired of rollin' for cl' Cunningham?”
I'm tired of rollin', well, well, well, But I ain't got long, but I ain't got long, I've got a few more
numbers and then I'll be gone, My papa called me and I answered “Sir” and I answered
“Sir, if you tired of rollin', what you stay there for?”
Go down, ol' Hannah, well, well, well, don't you rise no more.
