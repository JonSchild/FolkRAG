THE WALLACE SISTERS. 
3 
As the citizens of Titusville have been well entertained by these 
bright stars of the stage for several evenings, we think it may be in-
teresting to our readers to learn something of the past of tie beauti-
ful and gifted trio. 
These captivating and fascinating young ladies were born in Le 
cester, England, and at the ago of four years performed in the prin-
cipal London Theatres, in ehilde' parts, and created at that time a 
great sensation fur their wonderful adaptabVity for the stage. They 
made their first appearance at the Broadway Theatre, New York, in 
1169, then under the management of' George Wood. Miss Jennie 
Wallace soon became a 
great favorite, and won deserved praise in 
every rate she undertook. 
The mother has been on the stage since 
her childhood. 
She has brought up all her girls to the profession, 
and they have been thoroughly educated in every branch of the the-
atrical business, and when we take into consideration their age, and 
the brilliant dramatic talent which they now display, it Is safe to 
say that they have a 
great future before them. 
Their father was a 
music composer and leader ol an orchestra in one of the London the-
aters, and died when the girls were very young. Mrs. Walla ce i
s a 
very sell-re]iaut woman. Miss Jennie Wallace is probably the most 
popular actress that ever visited here. The performers of-this troupes 
are always free from the slightest tinge of vulgarity, either of speech 
or action, and they are always sure to draw crowded houses of the 
best of our citizens. 
Since starting from New York this season, the 
Wallace Sisters have met with an uninterrupted series of successes. 
We feel justified in saying that whenever these charming sisters— 
.Tenn, Minnie and Maud Wallace—with their profusion of golden hair, 
their invest, silvery voices, their sparkling and dashing style, their 
elegsat grace, and charming ways, return to Titusville they will 
meet with a 
warm and hearty welcome, and wherever they may co tho 
good wishes of all who have witnessed their fine and unexceptionable 
acting, and listened to their inimitable sayings, will go with them 
These girls have a 
high future before them, and will stand still higher 
in the ranks of their profession, in which, young as they are, they 
shine as bright stars. 
This little cluster of gems, Jennie, Minnie and Maud, and troupe, is 
under the able management of Prank Dobson, Esq..who deserves the 
greatest praise for his splendid management of tho best traveling 
organization in the world. 
[From the Titusville (Pennsylvania) Courier.] 
TO THE WALLACE SISTERS. 
By 
JOHN A. 
LANG. 
(Author of " Leisure Hours" and other poems.) 
I 
know three maidens fair, 
With flowing golden hair, 
Each one's eyes, 
Like azure skies, 
Gleam, Oh ! so heavenly clear. 
Even the stars by night, 
Glitter not half so bright. 
As the eyes of Jennie, 
Maud and Minnie, 
Beaming their mystic light. 
And these maidens three, 
Fair as fair can be 
Can play their parts, 
Like Cupid's darts, 
Oh, how brilliantly. 
When through the dance they glide, 
Gently side by side, 
Each and all, 
Throughout the hall, 
Wondering gaze, 
Swell their praise, 
And with one voice exulting cried, 
None like Jennie, 
Maud and Minnie, 
Sound their praises far and wide.

Good evening, friends, I 
hope you're well, 
A story to you I 
will tell 
how head and ears in love I 
fell 
With a 
dashing gay Brunette. 
The first time that I 
met her, 
I 
was riding in a 
car; 
A gentleman was with her, 
I 
think it was her Pa. 
I 
arose and said will you accept my seat, 
She bowed and thank'd me with a 
smile so sweet. 
This dashing gay Brunette. 
[Dance. 
We smiled and flirted as on we rode, 
I 
followed her to her abode, 
Into her hand I 
slipped a 
note, 
Asking if I 
might on her call ; 
Next day I 
got an answer, 
It filled me with delight. 
Stating I 
might call on her 
The coming Sunday night. 
I 
read and read her letter o'er again, 
I 
thought myself the luckiest of men, 
My dashing gay Brunette. 
At the appointed hour I 
rang the bell, 
'Twas answered by my little Nell, 
Iler blushing face at once did tell, 
Watching she had been for me. 
No longer could I 
hide it, so 
I 
told her of my love. 
And vowed I 
would be true to her. 
As are the stars above. 
She say'd that she could love none else but me, 
So next week 1 
am going to married be 
To my dashing gay Brunette.

You're looking remarkably well; 
No doubt you have met me before— 
'Twas at Long Branch, Broadway, or Palmall.

But you'll recollect me ' by the by ;" 
By respectable people I'm known 
As the swell with a

distinguished appearance, 
And as I 
go sauntering by; 
The darlings all sigh as though they would die 
For the swell with a

And make it stick out like a

Some have their weakness o R

No, by Jove, I 
can't see half as well;

It makes a

When the low folks they call me a

Which meets witi a

From this small piece of glass in my eye.

HIT THE RIGHT NAIL.—[CoeccLuDED.] 
The start in life we may compare 
To four cross roads that lead 
In different ways, but which to choose 
Is difficult indeed; 
Our judgment must be sign-post, and 
When that is wrong, we're led 
Through crpoked paths, and fail to hit 
The right nail on the head.—Cno. 
In courtship we should careful be, 
And pause upon the brink, 
For courtship is a 
ship, you know 
That easily will sink; 
Though matrimony's very nice, 
Pray, think before you wed, 
Or you may find, too late, you've hit 
rube wrong nail on the head.—Cito. 
Though luck may seem against us, if 
We only play with care 
The game of life, some winning cards 
Will fall unto our share; 
Don't throw the game up in despair, 
But try again instead 
With hearty will, and you must hit 
The right nail on the head.—Cno. 
There is a 
tide in the affairs 
Of man, said Shakespeare wise, 
That taken at the ebb will lead 
To fortune's lucky prize; 
Use judgement, and remember this 
" 
That, as we make our bed, 
So we must lie," so try to hit 
The right nail on the headl—Cm1

In the east the sun was rising, 
And the moon had gone to rest ; 
Sinking down behind the tree-tops 
To its home within the west. 
Where the pure white water lilies 
Bloom upon the river side, 
There, in the first flush of morning, 
I 
met Nell, the village pride.

lovely forest 
Sleeps this little woodland belle, 
And the birds are sweetly singing 
O'er the grave of little Nell. 
Sweet a 
lass as e'er a 
mortal 
On this earth e'er went to woo ; 
Laughing eyes all full of sunshine, 
Rivaling the sapphire's hue. 
In her cheek the rose and lily 
Sweetly with each other vied ; 
Aye ! a 
bonny lass was Nellie, 
Little Nell, the village pride. 
Now n 
it hin, 
Now she sleeps within the forest, 
Where the sweet Spring violets grow, 
And the lilies of the valley 
Blossom o'er her brow of snow. 
For one night in early Spring-time, 
With the falling of the tide, 
Angels bright came for sweet Nellie, 
Darling Nell, the village pride.

We watched the silver rays of light 
Above us softly quiver ; 
Oh 
life was fair, and rosy bright, 
Upon the Danube river. 
I 
held your little hand in mine, 
And thought not of the morrow ! 
I 
saw your eyes in beauty shine, 
Undimmed by clouds of sorrow. 
I 
would that both our lives might flow 
As calmly on forever ; 
'Twos Cupid at the helm, you know, 
Upon the Danube river! 
Wo watched the silver rays of light

Oh ! life was fAir, and rosy bright,

I SHOULDN'T 'LIKE TO TELL. 
'Twas in the early spring time, 
When birds began to mate; 
That first E 
met young Edward, 
Down by the garden gate. 
Upon the evening stillness, 
his voice so sweetly fell; 
The winning words he whispered, 
I 
shouldn't like to tell. 
In many a 
summer twilight., 
We stoo I 
together there; 
And, oh ! the bright world never 
To me seemed half so fair 
As when, above the chiming 
Of distant village bell, 
I 
heard that loving story-

shouldn't like to tell. 
Bright visions of the future, 
Our busy fancies wove ; 
As arm-in-arm together, 
We wandered through the grove. 
The boblink's note was sounding 
In copse and shady dell; 
And I 
listened to the story— 
I 
shouldn't like to tell. 
Out there, one summer evening, 
When stars were shining bright ; 
And the moon cast all around us 
Her chaste and silver light. 
Beneath a 
broad leaved linden, 
I 
yet remember well, 
I 
gave a 
solemn promise— 
I

Beneath an elm, beslcie the spring, 
I 
sat just as the moon came o'er the hill; 
And heard a 
voice in sweetness sing, 
Now methinks I 
hear it still. 
Angelic was the measure, 
It told of love and pleasure ; 
0, would she were my treasure, 
And I 
her chosen dear. 
cironus. 
To sit beside that cooling spring, 
Or dance upon the meadow's velvet green, 
And feel myself a 
woodland king, 
With a 
fairy little queen. 
Once more I 
went at set of sun, 
To hear that voice and catch the loving strain ; 
And ere the cuckoo had begun 
His sweet song, it came again. 
From out the limpid water, 
The gods had surely brought her, 
More fair than morial's daughter, 
Vtras she who drew me there.

To sit beside, 86e. 
My heart was filled with perfect bliss, 
When to me spoke that little water sprite ; 
Awl said her wish was only this 
That 1'41 conic, there ey'ry night." 
Now Wry night I 
meet her, 
Her voice is something sweeter ; 
'With mile and kiss. I 
greet her, 
Beneath that elm's cool shade

DARLING OF NY HEART. 
There's a 
lovely, charming girl. 
She's the sweetest one I've seen, 
And with such roguish, winning ways, 
Her age is just sixteen ! oh; 
C11011.tiS. 
She's an idol of a 
girl, 
My brain she set to whirl 1 
And in her dark-blue eyes, 
Lurks Cupid with his dart; 
The arrow came that bore his name, 
The darling of my heart. 
She's an idol, &C. 
She is just the raging style, 
Bewitching, gay and smart, 
I 
hope in time that she'll be mine, 
The darling of my heart. 
She's an idol, & c. 
She's the queen of lovely girls, 
That no one can deny. 
And it was she that smiled on me, 
And filled my heart with joy, oh I 
She's an idol, & e. 
I 
dream of her by night, 
Sweet love where .er thou art, 
My thoughts of thee shall ever be. 
The darling of my heart. 
She's an idol, & c, 
To-day I 
went up town 
My darling for to see, 
She spoke of a 
lad and made me mad, 
She likes him better than me, oh 
She's an idol, &C. 
She's dear to me as life. 
Till death we never part; 
Now I 
am thine and she is mine, 
The darling of my heart. 
e's an idol, eic.

When free from all the noise of town,

To wander with a 
little hand 
Laid gently on your arm ? 
Then tender words and loving looks, 
And pressure of the hands, 
All seem to come so natural 
When spooning on the sands.—Ciro. 
Old bachelors grow thoughtful as 
A 
happy pair goes past, 
And ancient maidens fondly hope 
Their turn may come at last; 
Then servants wish those children, who 
Are playing on the strand, 
Were far away, and wouldn't they 
Go spooning on the sand ?--Cuo. 
Papa and ma have had their day, 
And so they only smile, 
When bonnie Kate and handsome Jack 
Are absent such a

Of course, they say they only stayed 
To listen to the bands, 
To look at them, you'd think that they'd 
Been spooning on the sands.—Cno. 
Those sands are often quicksands, and 
When I 
their charms recall 
I 
only wonder we have left

There's magic in those sad sea waves 
That DO one can withstand,

MY LITTLE BUNCH OF ROSE. 
Words and Musis by Wm. IT. DtiLEZIANrx, 
I 
am waiting here to meet my darling, 
And my 'wart is in a 
flutter of delight; 
For we kissed last night when we were parting 
And this is where she bid me come to-night. 
When away from her I 
ant so lonely, 
I 
know not what to do; 
But her bright, sweet smile can ever cheer me, 
Iler heart is warm and true. Oh I 
Wheil we hissed then I 
saw her pretty blushes, 
She turned her face away the blush to hide 
I 
was happy with 
bunch of roses. 
My halo bunch of roses by my side. 
C110111.78. 
There is something that I 
must not tell, 
And that is where this maid does dwell, 
In her hair she wears a 
white camelia, 
And a 
dark blue is the color of her eyes. 
And I 
call her my little bunch of roses, 
My darling, charming, captivating prize. 
It was in those happy days of childhood, 
When first I 
met this roguish little belle ; 
By a 
streamlet running through the wild wood, 
Though but a 
boy, in love with her I 
fell. 
She is now the pride of all the city, 
Of Summers sweet sixteen, 
And is called by all a 
perfect beauty, 
A fawn-like, fairy queen. 
Olt ! 
Now I 
meet her almost every evening, 
And I 
think it is the sweetest thing in life; 
For to walk with the dower of my affection, 
Especially when she's soon to be my wife. 
There is something. & e, 
'Twas an evening when the moon was shining 
The little stars were twinkling far above; 
Arm- in-arm we were walking in the garden, 
'Twas there and then we both revealed our love. 
Si) I 
asked her then if she -would take me, 
For better or for W OrSi • ; 
When she smiled on no- so very swe,Ptly, 
A 
11(1 answorpd, " Yes, of course." 
Olt ! 
I 
confess that I 
otsVet waF4 So happy, 
Nor do I 
think that ever I 
could he; 
Till I've marriett my little hunch of roses, 
With a 
little hunch of roses nu my knee! 
There is something, & e.

MOONLIGHT AT CAPE MAY 
Oh ! my poor heart is not my own, 
It was stolen by a 
charming girl, 
Whose eyes are black and full of love 
And her teeth as white as pearl. 
How we first met I'll now tell you: 
'Twas to me such a 
happy day : 
"rwas down on the beach, in the evening, 
In the moonlight at Cape May. 
How sweet to me this girl did seem, 
The dear one of my happy dream— 
She's such a 
little beauty, 
Like a 
butterfly light and gay. 
I 
met her on the beach, in the evening, 
In the moonlight at Cape May. 
Oh ! she was gazing calml .
, , 
As the waves rolled near her feet; 
She turned her head as I 
came by : 
Then, of course, our eyes did meet. 
We spoke about the sweet moonlight, 
-While the hours they passed away. 
As we walked. I 
was so happy, 
In the moonlight at Cape May. 
How sweet to me, & e, 
Next evening as I 
passed the house, 
I 
called my love to see ; 
And side by side we rambled on, 
It was hours of bliss to me. 
I 
asked her it she \void(' have me: 
'Tor 
love you,'' I ( lid say. 
She promised then to be my wif 
In the moonlight at rape May. 
how sweet to me. &e.

'Now I'm going to tell you all a 
little story, 
But I 
promise you l'll not detain you long; 
its about a 
darling, charming, little sweet one, 
She's the captivating. subject of my song. 
But I'll tell you how we talked and how we flirted, 
When I 
met this belle: 
And ' twos then I 
called her little Dew D'Andies, 
For her name she would not tell. 
CHORUS. 
She's so sweet 
and so neat  
Oh I 
love the charming- little Dew D'Andics, 
She's the sweetest girl that ever you did see, 
And she often sings me love among the roses. 
Now boys, she's just the girl for me. 
When I 
met her first ' twos out upon a 
pic-nic, 
And I 
shall never forget her winning smile, 
For she danced and made the changes in the music, 
With her graceful pretty fascinating smile. 
Then I 
asked her for le:tr name and her directions, 
For I'd like to call, 
Then she turned around and whispered Dew D'Andies, 
And she smiling said ' twos all. 
She's so sweet, ctc. 
So, now listen to the sequel of my story, 
For as time rolled on we dearer friends became ; 
And though yet I 
call her little Dew D'Andies, 
I 
am sure she's trot another pretty mune. 
I 
have placed a 
ring upon her taper finger, 
So we're one, life fur life; 
And 
May my little Dew D'Andies, 
is may darling, charming wife. 
She's so sweet, Lti:c.

SHE'S THE SWEETEST EVER SEEN 
My heart it am so full of love, 
I 
don't know what to do, 
Since first I 
met that pretty girl, 
That I 
saw dressed in blue ; 
I 
was walking out one evening, 
My heart did palpitate, 
9nd passing by the house, I 
saw, 
Her standing at the gate. 
She's the sweetest ever seen, 
And dressed just like a 
queen 
Her hair it hung in ringlets, 
And then such lovely eyes 
If ever I 
should marry her, 
You bet, I'd get a 
prize. 
I 
went around to the house next evening-, 
Dressed in my clothes of best, 
With patent- leather high-heeled boots, 
A. nice silk hat and vest ; 
We walked and talked together, 
Until it was tiuile late, 
And bidding lia. iit,3weet good night, 
I 
left her at the gate. 
She's the sweetest, 
And now that we are to be married, 
And oh what happy times, 
An invitation I'll send all, 
To stop with us and dine ; 
But now I'll bid you all good night, 
I've no time to wait, 
I'm to go around the corner for 
To meet her at the gate. 
She's the sweetest. ttie.

I 
am a 
jovial collier lad, 
As blithe as blithe can be, 
For lot the times be good or bad, 
They're all the same to me; 
'Tis little of the world I 
know, 
And care less for its ways, 
For where the dog- star never glows, 
I 
wear away my days. 
cuonu.s. 
Down in a 
coal mine, underneath the grourd, 
-Where a 
gleam of sunshine never call be found; 
Digging dusky diamonds all the season round, 
Down in a 
coal mine underneath the ground. 
2.1y bands are horny, hard and black 
With working in the vein, 
And like the clothes upon my back, 
INly speech is rough and plain ; 
Well, if I 
stumble with my tongue, 
I've one excuse to say, 
'Tis not the collier's heart that's wrong, 
'Tis the head that goes astray. 
Down in a 
coal mine, & c. 
At every shift, be't soon or late, 
I 
haste my bread to earn, 
And anxiously my kindred wait, 
A 
nd watch for my return: 
For death that levels all alike. 
Whate'er their rank may be, 
Amid Eh. fire and damp may strike 
And fling his darts at me. 
Down in a 
coal mine, &c. 
How little do the great ones care 
Who sit at home secure, 
-What hidden dan..ers colliers dare 
What hardships they endure! 
The very fires their mansions boast 
To cheer themselves and wives, 
II vim]) tvere kindled at the cost 
Of jovial colliers' lives. 
Down in a 
coal mine, & c. 
Then cheer up, lads, and make ye much 
Of every joy ye can. 
But let your mirth be always such 
As best becomes a 
man ; 
However fortune turns about 
We'll mid be jovial souls, 
For what would nations be without 
The lads that look for coals.

EIS HEART WAS TRUE TO POLL. 
:—" 
In 1569." 
I 
heard my aunt once sing a 
chant, 
W ! licit now iir'aps it,n't new, 
Of Billy Kidd, who, whatever he did, 
To his Poll was always true. 
He sailed away in a 
gallant ship 
From the pretty port of jovial Bristol, 
And the last words as he uttered, 
While his hankerehee he fluttered, 
Were " My heart is true to Poll." 
My heart is true to Poll, (
bicsinees) 
No matter what you do, 
If your heart is ever true, 
And his heart was true to Poll. 
They were wrecked. 
William, to shore he swam, 
And he looked about for an inn, 
When a 
noble savage lady, of a 
color rather shady, 
Came up, with a 
cheerful grin ; 
Says she, " Marry me, and a 
king you'll be, 
And in a 
palace loll, 
Or they'll att you like a 
filet ;" 
So he gave his hand, did Billy, 
But his heart was true to Poll. 
My heart is true to Poll, &c.. 
So William Kidd a 
happy life led 
As the King of Kikaroos. 
Tie had nothing but a 
hat upon his head, 
And a 
pair of over-shoes. 
They made him a 
present of twenty wives, 
Which their beauties I 
cannot now extol; 
But one day they all revolted, 
So he back to Bristol bolted, 
For his heart was true to Poll. 
My heart is true to Poll, & c. (Dance.)

light, And the Wo- man in White,was—the Woman in White. 
I 
treated her twice to strawberry-ice, 
And nine oyster patties she put out of sight, 
She ate jelly and jam, and chicken, and ham, 
Till her face like her dress was decidedly white; 
Her mouth was so small and her appetite large, 
'Twas awful, 'twas awful 
Some two, ten and six was the moderate charge 
For feeding the Woman in White.—Cno. 
Her style was so nice, I 
laughed at the price, 
I 
expended on Polly Ann Sarah Ann Wright; 
I 
quickly proposed, and the bargain was closed, 
That I 
soon should marry the Woman in White. 
But to think of her now brings the tear to mine eye, 
It's awful, it's awful! 
She's a 
fright, and a 
sight, and a 
horrible guy, 
No longer the Woman in White. 
SPOKEN.—After our marriage she looked as white as a 
ghost 
that had been through the court and been whitewashed, as white as 
a 
marble Venus with its clothes on. 
Fluttered by excitement, I 
gave her the first thing to drink I 
could lay my hand on, or she 
would have fainted; I 
thought I 
gave her cognac, alas! it was hair 
dye, nitrate of silver; she drank, with what effect Wilkie Collirs 
and the next verse alone can tell—Cm. 
The notion is new, but it also is true, 
She swallowed her hair dye that horrible night, 
Her skin changed its hue to an indigo blue, 
Which made her at once a 
most terrible fright. 
There's a 
moral to come, in a 
present I 
think, 
It's awful, it's awful ! 
But hair dye's a 
lotion that no one should drink, 
As did the fair Woman in White.—Cito.

51' WITH THE LARK IN THE MORNING. 
I 
like to be jolly in a 
moderate way, 
But think it a 
pity to hear folks 
Dri k 
and be merry : ill the break of day, 
No " Jull Dog" am I. 
On my ercertion I 
dep nd, 
o 
other weal:h I 
crave ; 
And hough I 
have the heart to spend, 
I've still the sense to save. 
CHORUS. 
For I 
never drink h 
rd— it don't suit me, 
Nor toss 
y 
iriend w,th a 
one, two, three, 
Merry and wise is t .e 
motto for 
And up with the lark in the morning. 
There's a 
time for pleasure r 
rid a 
time for play, 
A 
time to labor and a 
time to be gi.y, 
if the sun shines bright, yr u 
must make ay, 
And I'll tell you the reason why. 
To-da we may be halo and strong., 
To-morrow who can tell, 
Without the heAth to earn a 
cent, 
Without a 
friend o 
s 
well. 
So I 
never drink hard, ike. 
If I 
had the money that some have got, 
I'd scatter a 
bit in the laborer's cot, 
And the struggling poor, for I 
pity their lot, 
No miserly man am I. 
So I've always a 
dollar if I 
want to spend, 
I've always a 
dollar if I 
want to lend, 
I've als\ ays a 
dollar for a 
poor old friend, 
For a 
careful man am I. 
Though I 
never drink hard, &e. 
No dePer ing man should ay 
He ever pas ed my door 
In want, upon the ‘rorld's highway, 
I'd ne'er forget the poor. 
I 
envy not the rich man's lot, 
Or princes diadem; 
The poor man working at the p7ough 
Will one day equal them. 
Yet I 
never drink hard, (ix;

THE PRIZE PACKAGE MAN. 
AVritten by GEORGE W . 
OSBORN. 
Sung by TONY PAsTOR. 
I 
saw him on the corner 
Of Broadway and Chambers street ; 
And all the people flocked around 
To hear his voice so sweet. 
To buy his candy packages 
The men and women ran ; 
There's a 
prize in every packag,e 
Says the prize package man. 
So jump up, and get up, any way you can, 
There's a 
prize in every package, says the prize package 
man. 
He was a 
gallus fellow, 
And he wore a 
big moustache ; 
he'd sing a 
song, and crack a 
joke, 
Which some might think was rash; 
But still they gathered round him 
As soon as he began. 
And all the ladies doted on 
This prize package man. 
:Nov jump up. and get up, any way you can, 
There's a 
prize hi every package, says the prize package 
man. 
I 
saw my Angelina 
Standing in the crowd ; 
The package man he smiled on her, 
And then she winked and bowed. 
Imitate 
And when she took a 
package, 
crying. 
I 
saw him squeeze her hand ; 
S 
There's a 
prize in every package 
Says the pi ize package man. 
So jump up, and get up, any way you can, 
There's a 
prize in every package, says the prize package 
man. 
I 
called on Angelina 
The evening of that day; 
_Imitate t And it almost br(lie my heart to hear 
crying. 
Thal she had run away. 
j 
A billy-dux to my address 
Was left upon the stand ; 
Saving she had skedaddled 
With the prize package man. 
Now if r 
catch the rascal. I'll bust him if I 
can, 
And I'll scatter all the prizes of the prize package man; 
UI jump up, and get up. any way I 
can, 
And I'll dislocate the bugle of that prize package man.

THE FEMALE AUCTIONEER. 
Well, here I 
am, and what of that 
Methinks I 
hear you cry I 
I 
am come, and that is pat. 
To see if you will buy ! 
A female auctioneer I 
stand 
But not to seek for pelf ; 
For the only lot I've now on hand, 
Is just to sell myself. 
CHORUS. 
And I'm going, going, going, going, 
Who bids who bids for me ? 
For I'm going, going, going, going, 
Who bids, who bids for me? 
Though some may deem me pert or so, 
They deal in idle strife, 
For where's the girl I'd like to know, 
Would not become a 
wife; 
Indeed, I 
really think I 
should, 
In spite of all alarms, 
So, bachelors, pray be so good 
As just to take me to your arms, 
For I'm going, & c. 
Ye bachelors my way tow'rds you, 
Should not your thoughts mislead, 
I've never vet been called a 
flirt, 
Or coquette—no indeed! 
My heart and hand I 
offer fair, 
And if you buy the lot, 
I'll vow all Caudling, I 
will spare, 
When hymen ties the knot 
For I'm going, & c. 
DARLING MINIONETTE. 
You may talk about your fascinating beauties, 
Your fashionable blondes and pretty beiles; 
But the subject of my song I'm going to sing you, 
Is par excellence the queen of all the swells. 
We met, ' twas in a 
crowd and then we parted, 
The beauty of her face I 
will ne'er forget, 
As she never told her name I 
cannot tell it: 
Bat I 
have christened her my Darling Miuionette. 
CHORUS 
She is sweeter than the flowers I 
name her after, 
And the memory of her beauty haunts me yet. 
There is a 
band of opera music in her laughter, 
You will know her she is my Darling INIinionette• 
She looked at me, a 
glance was all I 
wanted, 
As I 
followed her along the crowded street, 
And my memory with her loveliness was haunted, 
As she tripped so lightly on those fairy feet. 
The second time she cast her eye upon me, 
She smiled on me and then a 
moment more, 
She rang the bell and faded from my vision, 
Then all was dull, for she was there no more. 
She is sweeter, & c. 
Next day in hopes to see my little darling, 
I 
sought the house, 'twos No. ninety four, 
When the poodle in the house commenced a 
snarling, 
And barking loudly chased me from the door, 
I 
ran along the street and he ran after, 
And with his teeth he seized my pantaloons, 
He hu ng 
on whil e I 
he crowd convulsed with laughter 
Cried that's the chap that stole the silver $,poons. 
She is sweeter. & c.

THE RISING GENERATION 
Go where you will, you'll get your fill 
of modern airs and 
graces— 
Our little 
s 
desert their toys to put on manly faces— 
With dyed moustache they cut a 
dash, go in for dissipation ; 
With quizzing glass they eye each lass, this Rising Generation. 
When not sixteen they're often seen upon some midnight frolic, 
They wink their eye and wiggle by, like a 
lobster with tit' 
colic ; 
Oft in a 
fight at dead of night they're draggged off to the 
station, 
Papa will pay the fine next day for this Rising Generation. 
Their ma's we'd thank if they would spank those naughty little 
friskers, 
Or take the dears and box their ears, or 
pull their little 
whiskers. 
But no, they say, our boys are gay, a 
pattern for the nation ; 
They are our pride so let them slide, this Rising Generation. 
And then the girls with flowing curls raised on the head of 
others, 
Each one a 
belle who cuts a 
swell, outrages like the brothers; 
They flirt their fans like warming pans for public approbation ; 
Dressed out like dolls with waterfalls, this Rising Generation. 
And then the pets wear fishing nets, with which to catch some 
sculping ; 
They make you treat for all they eat, for they are fond of 
gulping. 
Ice cream, strawberries, peaches, cherries, they eat a hearty 
ration, 
And they don't go back on their apple jack, this Rising Gene 
ration.

I 
fell in love with a 
pretty girl, 
A few slim t 
years ago. 
All sorts of weather. hail or rain, 
To court her I 
would go; 
I'd ton , and sigh with love until 
'Twas time to be away, 
And when I 
asked a 
parting kiss, 
She always used to say: 
C1101:US. 
Oh, mother says I 
mustn't, mother says I 
mustn't ! 
Oh, George. please. George, not just yet awhile ; 
Mother says I 
mustn't, mother sAys I

Oh, George, don't, George, not just yet. 
I waiting" kept, at last, one day, 
I 
thought I'd know my fate, 
I 
sunk upon my knees in quite 
An agonizing state ; 
" 
Selina, say you'll have your George, 
And when shall we he wed ?" 
I 
longed to bear my love's reply, 
And this is what she said— 
Spokon—Well, George, dear, you're very kind, bat we could never 
live on two hundred a year, so until you are worth at least five 
hundred per annum, darling— 
Mother says I 
mustn't, & e. 
From then I 
went to work, by Jove ! 
I 
left no stone unturned, 
Until five hundred pounds a 
year. 
At last I 
really earned ; 
Selina heard how things had chamed, 
And when we wet o- e 
day, 
She senmed so pleasant, and at last 
She lovingly did say— 
Spoken—Yon remember. George, dear, what I 
said when yen asked 
too some time ago.—well, George, (leaf., as you have so improved in 
circumstances, suppose you ask 1110 91,010, Georgy, Porgey, darling ?

Well, said. I, upon consideration you're very kind. hut— 
Mother says I 
mustn't, fice. 
Give me the girl who loves a 
man, 
And loves him for himself, 
Whose first consideration is, not 
What he's worth in pelf: 
Al sordid-minded damsels, who 
May worship golden dr,,ss. 
May they be old maids till they die, 
And we'll never feel their loss— 
Spoken—So ladies who don't want to be old maids, mind you, don't 
once too often say—

SHATIESPERE'S DREAM, 
By T. M. SumLos. 
Am :—" Wearing of the Green." 
A victim of Circumstances and a 
Ba,shful Irishman 
Were seen, one morning, to dance the French Can-Can; 
The Lancashire Lass was seen a 'raining of the Shrew, 
With Barney, the Baron, on her man to help the matter through. 
TheOrand Duchess stoops to Conquer, Under the Gaslight After Dark, 
h 
Black-eyed Susan by her side : Oh ! isn't she a 
lark? 
Shylock keeps in Chatham street a 
Lager-Bier Saloon, 
Where Hamlet and the Orange Girl will spend their honeymoon. 
The Ticket-of Leave- Man's troubled, lest he'll be sent to Botany-Bay ; 
Bois Wait in_t for the Verdict, and I 
think he'll see Foul Play; 
The Ghost of Hamlet's Fattier was heard to raise a 
buzz ; 
The Emerald Ring will glitter, when Ireland's as it was. 
The Man with the Carpet-bag was seen to steal a 
silver spoon, 
Has Ben Butler for his counsel, and he'll .be Caste out soon ; 
It's mighty odd for Tommy Dodd he's always safe to win, 
Ile's run away, and married to the beautiful East Lynne. 
The Gentleman from Ireland is In and Oat of Place, 
There's No Thoroughfare in Camden where a 
horse can run a 
race, 
Jack Sheppard robbed Othello ; Falstaff's got a 
cramp, 
The Black Crook and the White Fawn have collected many a 
stamp. 
The School for Scandal's open, Jonathan Bradford has gone in, 
With Coriolanns on his back, to sing him 
it O'Linn ; 
The Tempest has subsided, now we'll have a 
Winter's Tale, 
'f.rhere's something wrong, I'm thinking, with the Rose of Ettrick Vale. 
Nicholas Nickleby and Oliver Twist are true friends now, I'm told, 
That's nothing new however ; for, they were friends of old, 
raid Pry is on his Last Legs: Robert Emmet lost his life, 
King Richard the III, has run awi,y with the Flying Dutchman's wife. 
A terrible Flash of Lightning was seen on the Jersey shore, 
The Rivals have had a 
scuffle with I 
lie peet Thomas Moore ; 
The Forty Thieves are all in jail, for making, too much noise : 
The Toodles have run away W th one of Julius Ctesar's boys. 
Our American Cousin's married, and Dnnitreary he has sneezed, 
Dick Turpin courted Jenny Lind and her hand Le gently squeezed ; 
The Tame Cat began to howl ; tint Wild Cats grew too fast,

There was Much Ado About Nothing when Lueullns slew the Mule.

THE DIAMOND TAKE THE HEART. 
AIR:—" Wearing of the Green." 
Kind friends I 
come to sing a 
song of what I 
do not know, 
Unless it is of what you've seen in the news sonic days ago ; 
If there's some that have not seen it, and studied well its part, 
I 
now tell them its title is—" The diamond takes the heart." 
You'll find it so in every place, whether you're good or bad, 
No matter if vou're homely, if you but own a 
nag ; 
And have plenty of money, why strangers will take your part, 
And say you're a 
good fellow, for the diamond takes the heart. 
You may be a 
noted vagabond, and have just knocked off the link, 
In a 
minute you're an honest man, if you but show the chink; 
And if a 
courting you should go, and cupid sends his dart, 
Though bad you be, if you've money, you're sure to win her heart: 
Mind I 
do not say in every case, that this is sure to pass; 
But nine-tenths I 
know will have you for your money in a 
mass. 
She'll not have you if you've on poor clothes, no matter if you're 
smart, 
Put a 
good rig on, she'll die for you—for the diamond takes the 
heart. 
Now when a 
man gets about forty, young girls will laugh at him 
And say he's an old fogy, and but a 
played out limb. 
They'll make all sorts of fun of him, and if he should propose, 
We tnay expect to hear the young girl say, " old man go wipe 
your nose." 
If his mouth does stretch from ear to ear, or if a 
byword be his 
name ; 
Or if he has no principle, or is broken down and lame; 
Or if he's forced to wear a 
wig, or on his nose there'd be a 
wart : 
Yet if he's rich, why she'll have him—for the diamond takes the 
heart. 
Now I 
think I've proven in my song, all what I've said is true : 
Yet still I 
hope and pray, it may never happen to you. 
Don't despise a 
man because he wears a 
ragged coat, 
You'll find an honest heart beneath, and staunch as a 
life-boat. 
Then if you are a 
young girl, love Into because he's poor; 
I 
ie may be rich one of these days, then can you wish for more ? 
Or if a 
young man you may be, then take her, do not start, 
Altho' she's poor, let it ne'er be said, that the diamond took the 
heart.

Behold in me a 
wretched man, quite broken down by woe, 
I've lost my wife and cannot find her anywhere 1 
go; 
At first she robbed me of my heart and now she's flown 
from me, 
And taken all my furniture, wherever can she be ? 
CIIORUS. 
Perhaps she's on the railway, with a 
swell so fair,— 
Perhaps she's up in a 
balloon, flying thro' the air; 
Perhaps she's dead, perhaps alive. perhaps she's on the sea ; 
Perhaps she's gone to Brigham Young, a 
Mormonite to be. 
She read so much of Mormonites, of nothing else she'd 
talk, 
And with a 
sanctified young chap each day she used to 
walk; 
She said he was a 
Mormon saint from far across the sea. 
I 
have not seen her for a 
week, wherever can she be ? 
Perhaps she's, & c. 
She can't respect the marriage vows, that faithfully she 
swore, 
I 
only hope her Mormon spouse has fifty wives or more; 
I 
hope he'll thrash her every night when he comes home 
to tea, 
I 
hope they'll always row and fight wherever they may be. 
Perhaps she's, &c. 
I 
hope she'll have a 
lot of hungry, squalling brats to keep, 
I 
hope they'll cry all night, and never let her go to sleep ; 
I 
hope her chimneys all may smoke, her lodgers never pay, 
And German bands and organ men annoy her all the day. 
Perhaps she's, &c. 
If she is in the railway train, I 
hope that it will smash ; 
If up in a 
balloon, I 
hope she'll fall out with a 
crash ; 
If on the road to Salt Lake, then, I 
hope she may get 
drowned, 
Then I 
will get another wife and quickly I'll be bound. 
Perhaps she's, &c.

NOTHING. 
Ain :—" The Irish Washerwoman." 
When rhyming and verses at first were in fashiOn, 
And poets and authors indulged in their passion: 
Select what they might for their subject ' twas new, 
A 
nd that's more than our modern Scribblers can ao. 
The ancients have wrote upon each thing in nature 
Descrili'd its variety, genius, ana feature; 
They havino- exhausted all fancy could bring, 
And as nothing is left—why of nothing I 
sing. 
From nothing we came, and whatever's our station, 
To nothing we owe an inmiense obligation ; 
'Whatever we gain or whatever we learn, 
in time we shall all into nothing return. 
This world came from nothing, at least so says history, 
Of course about nothing there's something of mystery ; 
Man came from nothing, and by the same plan, 
-Why, -woman was made from the rib of a 
man. 
Since, then, a 
man hunks a 
nothing of taking 
A woman to join, and again his rib making, 
There's nothing can give so much joy to this life, 
For nothing's so rare as a 
good-humour'd wife. 
Front nothing we came, & c. 
Thinking of nothing is some folks' enjoyment, 
Doing of nothing is litany's employment : 
Th e l

That they say nothing. do nothing, all the day long, 
Some folks do pass t

liv noticing losing, and by nothing wiii

Nothing they buy, and nothing tlitty 
Nothing tbey know, and of nothing they tell. 
From nothing we came, & e. 
There's something in nothing exceedingly clever, 
For nothing will last i•nt, for ever toil ever ; 
Time will make every thing, fade away last, 
AV hi iii, nothing will certainly durable last 
Yon make talk about anytlang, but its cont'ition 
With nothinJ for cc cmi t 
ean•t bear competition , 
And so I 
praise nothing, for nothing my gains, 
And nothing I 
certainly get for my pains. 
From •notlaitg we Came, & O. 
That life is all nothing is plainer and plainer, 
So he that gers nothing is surely a 
gainer; 
All about not

'fake nothing from nothing there'll ?lathing remain. 
Thus with this nothing the time out I'm spinning, 
And nothing will sometimes set many folks gtinning 
Believe lute. ill this there is nothing so true, 
Tho aupor who wrote this had nothing to do. 
From nothing we came, ig0., 
SOMETHING.

Attend, my good friends, for I've learnt something new, 
And something now prompts lute to sing it to you ; 
Folks a e 
eager for something wherever we go, 
For something is better than nothing:, you know ; 
Unless something happen to cause one to grieve. 
That sot/act/a/kJ for notning of course you would leave,

BUT OF COURSE ITS NO BUSINESS OF MINE. 
Words by GEORGE COOPER. 
Some people say I 
am curious, 
For they know that I 
never refuse, 
No matter from whence I 
obtain it, 
In getting the latest, of news. 
I 
certainly own that I 
do so, 
And no harm there is I 
opine; 
But whatever I 
hear I 
keep close, 
For of course it's no business of mine. 
Now, I 
see lots of chaps on Broadway. 
Who are dressed in very best style, 
With a 
diamond pin stuck in their bosoms, 
With kids and the shiniest tile. 
They measure out tape in some shop, 
And their salaries ain't very fine; 
Now I'd like to know how it is done, 
But of course it's no business of mine. 
Now, there's Jones, he's a 
temperance man, 
And he never will go near a 
bar, 
But his nose is as red as a 
berry, 
It shines like a 
lighthouse afar. 
He always drinks milk on a 
Sunday, 
And he says that it's wIndesome and fine ; 
He's a 
friend of the late Deacon Smythe, 
But of course it's no business of mine. 
Now, I 
know lots of married men, too, 
That are steady and sober at home; 
When they're out of the sight of their spouses, 
From paths which are narrow they roam. 
They drive about town in their coaches, 
And you oft see them kick up a 
shine; 
To the " Personals" daily they're writing, 
But of course it's no business of wine.

Let some folks talk of foreign life, its pleasures and its joys,

And rattling, dashing London, too, is quite thrown in the

Upon the Grand Parade, upon the Grand Parade, 
Oh ! such a

What can he more delightful, than the charming morning

And have for a 
very long time, 
The' I 
never had courage to tell her, 
So wrote down my feelings in rhyme. 
I've to meet her to-night in the Park, 
And while the iron's hot I 
will strike it: 
She never acknowledged she loved me, 
But I 
think it looks very much like it, 
Yes, I 
think it looks very much like it. 
IIer hair falls in curls down her back, 
And when at me she looks with her eyes, 
In that sort of way you all know— 
Then drops them again, and then sighs. 
Her cheek looks so beautifully plump 
That sometimes I 
think I 
could bite it, 
But that I'm afraid she'd object to. 
At least I 
don't think she'd much like it, 
Yes, at least I 
don't think she'd muf_th like it, 
One night 1 
went to her 
house, 
Intending to take her a 
walk; 
When I 
saw AngeliT:a with a 
stranger, 
having a 
nice little talk; 
I 
was in such a 
rage at the time, 
With my cane I 
thought i 
should strike him ; 
She afterwards said 'twas her brother, 
But T 
told her she wasn't much ike him. 
Yea, I 
told her she wasn't much like him. 
I 
seriously spoke to her after, 
For at that time I 
seriously thought 
If she didn't quite know what was right, 
1 
said she ought to be taught, 
She said she ne'er meant to deceive me, 
And if aught was wrong she would right it 
I 
don't think she tried to humbug me, 
But I 
think it looks very much like it. 
Yes, I 
think it looks very much like it. 
One thing about her I 
don't like, 
That is, that she often will smoke, 
And when I 
speak to her about it, 
She says it's done for a 
joke. 
From my case she last night b,ok a 
weed, 
And she knew the right way, too, to light it; 
I 
don't say she's given to smoking, 
But I 
think it Loks very much like it. 
Yes, I 
think it looks very much like it. 
By Jove, tho', I 
must go at once, 
Or I'm certain that I 
shall be late, 
For if I'm not there in my time, 
Angelina will be in such a 
state. 
For the kindness which you've shown to me 
I'll do my utmost to requite it; 
I 
don't say you're going to applaud rue, 
But I 
think it looks very much like it. 
Yes, I 
think it looks very much liku it.

Oh ! I'm in love, I 
do declare 
With the sweetest ever seen, 
A 
charming little maid so fair, 
Of her I 
ever dream. 
The first time that I

As she went passing by.

You may talk about your pretty girls, 
That to put on style they try, 
But you should have see my little girl, 
As she went passing by. 
I 
turned about to see which way 
The little beauty went, 
For in my heart I 
felt indeed 
Love's dart had there been sent. 
She was on the corner standing, 
And my courage I 
did try; 
I 
said I 
thought I 
knew her 
As she went passing by. 
You may talk, 
She smiled on me so sweetly

Words never breath'd beNore, 
Sounding so sweet to somebody, 
Under the maple tree, 
Dark though the shadow be, 
Plain enough they can see; 
Bright eyes has somebody. 
Somebody, (tic. 
No one sits up to wait, 
Though she is out so late, 
All know she's at the gate, 
Talking, yes, talking with som body, 
Two, sitting side by side, 
Float with the ebbing tide ; 
"Thus, d 
arest, may we glide, 
Through life," says somebody.

THE BIG WALL-FLOWER. 
There was a 
sort of kind of grace, 
About a 
girl I 
met, 
She wore a 
shawl of orange lace, 
Her hair was in a 
net. 
I 
met her in a railway train, 
When going down to Row; 
If I 
don't see that girl again, 
Whate'er shall I 
do.—Oh. 
CHORUS. 
For I 
felt just as happy as a 
big wall flower, 
Or any plant you like to show me, 
But ever since that day, I've fallen so away, 
That my shadow would never know me. 
I 
spoke to her, she spoke to me, 
And blushed a 
lovely yellow, 
"Oh,—go along, you are," said she 
' 
An impudent young fellow." 
I treated her to shrimps and tea, 
And paid without demur, 
And cruelly she treated me, 
When I 
had treated her—Oh. 
For I 
felt just as happy, fie. 
Oh, 'twas in an arbor quite apart, 
I 
went down on my knees, 
And offered her my hand and heart 
And said, " Oh, have me please ; 
She let me stay my knees upon— 
That cruellest of Belles— 
She knew that I 
was kneeling on 
Sharp periwinkle shells- 011. 
For I 
felt just as happy, ctc 
At last she slid, " it cannot was, 
Oh, no it inut not, be." 
I 
asked her why ? she said, " Because, 
married, don't you see.'' 
I 
fled away and since that day, 
I've grown so thin, I 
fear 
If I 
keep shrinking in this way, 
I 
soon shad disappear— Oh. 
For I 
felt just as happy, &o. 
I'M HERE AGAIN TO GREET YOU ALL. 
As Sung by TONY PASTOR. 
I'm here again to greet you all, 
To please you I 
must sing, sirs, 
And now I've got another song. 
You'll find is just the thing, sirs; 
The suoject is a 
common one, 
it's the last and best sensation, 
So if you listen I 
will toll, 
Of a 
terriole temptation. 
Yes, Ill engage it's all the rage, 
This terriblo temptation. 
A gay young clerk be falls in love, 
The sensation it is so funny, 
He presents makes of diamond rings, 
Gold watches chains, and money, 
His salary is quite small you know, 
But he's got a 
situation. 
-Where he helps himself to all he wants, 
For this terrible temptation. 
But soon he's caught, that ends his pot, 
'Tis this terrible temptation. 
A man gets married, settles down, 
Resolves to live quite steady, 
He stays at home, quite temperate lives, 
No more for sprees he's ready. 
In a 
little while be nil eets a 
friend, 
Takes a 
drink for recreation, 
He staggers home drunk as a 
lord, 
/Cs a 
terrible temptation. 
He says, dear wife, joy of my life, 
It's a 
terrible temptation. 
One day while walking round the town, 
A fellow less than human, 
Insulted on the public street, 
A weak, defenceless woman. 
I 
quickly put a " head " on him, 
Gave his eye an elevation, 
I 
kicked him where his coat tails hang, 
'Twas a 
terrible temptation. 
For woman's rights Pll always fight, 
'Tis a 
terrible temptation. 
A bachelor old and crusty grown, 
For bean ty has no eye. sir, 
Declares he hates all woman kind, 
Roll single live and (Pe. sir 
But let a 
young, bewitching elf, 
Try her powers of fascination.

About a
