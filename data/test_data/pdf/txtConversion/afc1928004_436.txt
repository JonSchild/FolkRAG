I 
took my girl one day, 
A sailing down the bay, 
And Emma was the darling creature's name; 
While standing on the pier, 
Some chaps at her did stare, 
And one and all around her did exclaim : 
CitoitUS. 
Oh! Emma, whoa! Emma, 
Emma, you put me in quite a 
dilemma; 
Oh! Emma, whoa! Emma, 
That's what I 
hear wherever I 
go. 
asked them what they meant, 
When some one at me sent 
An egg, which nearly struck me in the eye 
Emma began to scream, 
"Oh! Fred, what does this mean?" 
I 
asked again, and this was their reply: 
Oh! Emma, etc. 
I 
thought they'd never cease, 
So shouted out " Police I" 
And when he came he looked at roe so sly; 
The crowd then at me laughed, 
And said I 
must be " daft," 
And once again they all commenced to cry: 
Oh! Emma, ete 
An old man said to me, 
" 
Why, young man can't you see 
The joke!" and I 
look'd at him with surprise! 
He said " don't be put out," 
It's a 
saying's got about; 
And then, their voices seem'd to rend the skies! 
Oh Emma, etc,

He gave me a 
pretty red rose, 
While rambling to-night o'er the lea, 
And said as he kissed me good-bye, 
\Year this in your breast love for me. 
'Tis fading and falling apart, 
But close to my heart it will cling, 
While lonely I 
sigh for my darling's bright eye, 
Of my pretty red rose I 
will sing. 
CHORUS. 
My pretty red rose, my pretty red rose, 
'Tis a 
sweet little token, my pretty red rose, 
While lonely I 
sigh for my darling's bright eye, 
sing of my pretty red rose. 
'Tis a 
dear little mem'ry of love, 
How sad that it soon must decay, 
But fondly I'll treasure its leaves, 
Though their beauty may vanish away. 
Sweet moments of joy it recalls, 
And lulls every sigh to repose; 
Tho' now we're apart still my true lover's heart 
Seems to dwell in my pretty red rose.

Sweet visions of childhood, how bright they appear 
When our lives are o'ercloudod with care; 
How fondly we dream of them year after year, 
And how lovely they are and how fair. 
Oh, bless'd are the scenes I 
ne'er can forget: 
Dearest mother so kind and so true; 
Sweet home that I 
left with the saddest regret, 
How my heart fondly turns unto you. 
CHORUS. 
Sweet visions of childhood return to me now, 
And I 
weep for the days that are past; 
My fond mother's kiss and her hand on ray brow, 
In the days that were too bright to last. 
Sweet visions of childhood, how dear to each heart, 
Once again by a 
fair mother's knee 
I 
linger while fast welling tears fondly start, 
And the past comes in beauty to me. 
Oh, time may destroy all the bright joy of life, 
But this bosom will ever retain 
Lovely visions of thee, 'mid the world's busy strife, 
Bringing bliss to this fond heart again. 
Sweet visions, ir,e.

To him who my soul will save.

There's one little wis:. I

CHORUS. 
Oh, the days will come to you darling, 
When on earth no more I'll be seen, 
One sweet little wish, darling, grant me, 
See that my grave's kept green. 
Will you keep me, love, in remembrance, 
When the voice of chiding is heard, 
While other's may speak in censure or blame, 
Speak not one unkindly word.

Rockaby, lullaby, dear little rover, 
Down into wonderland, down to the underland, 
Go, oh go! down into wonderland go! 
Rockaby, lullaby, rain on the clover, 
Tears on the eyelids that waver and weep; 
Rockaby, lullaby, bending it over, 
Down on the motherworld, down on the other world, 
Sleep, oh sleep I 
down on the other world sleep! 
Rockaby, lullaby, rain on the clover, 
Dew on the eyes that will sparkle at dawn; 
Rockaby, lullaby, dear little rover, 
Into the stilly world, into the lilly world, 
Gone, oh gone! into the lilly world gone!

Last week my wife said-- Arthur dear, 
I 
should so like a 
change, 
it's rather dull for me at home, 
Now couldn't you arrange, 
To meet me after business hours, 
And then you know we might 
Just have a 
little dinner, dear, 
And go somewhere at night. 
Finsr DIALoGuE.—Why, certainly, my popsey-wopsey, we 
will 
So, meeting with my old friend Brown, he being a 
very 
jolly fellow, advised me to take her to see Pink Dominoes, ' twill 
make you roar! 
It did—with rage! for ever since he has done 
nothing but sing : 
CHORUS. 
Oh! Pink Dominoes, you've settled me for life, 
And why did I 
not see you first before I 
took my wife; 
She says she's found me out, and in my face she throws 
All the naughty things they do in Pink Dominoes. 
He thought he locked a 
guilty wretch, 
While everybody roared, 
He chewed Ins programme into pulp, 
He felt 80 very bored; 
11 
His wife she sat like all the rest, 
Laughing at the fun, 
Says she, " How could you bring me here, 
To show me how ' tis done?" 
SECOND DIALOGUE — So that's 
the way vou deceive your 
poor wife, is it? sending false telegrams and false letters, like 
that wicked fellow in the play .And ever since he has been 
singing— 
Oh! Pink Dominoes, etc.. 
Now should that author cross my path. 
I'll make him use his pen, 
To write a 
big apology 
To all the married men; 
And as for Brown— the horrid wretch— 
The cause of all my woes, 
I 
will be sure to pay him out, 
And give him awful blows. 
THIRD DIALOGUE.—No, I 
won't; 
I'll buy two orchestra tick-
ets, and send them to his wife; then perhaps he will have oc-
casion to sing— 
Oh! Pink Dominoes, etc.

You've heard aboud a 
gal I 
loved, 
Dot used to be so stout, 
How she " shook " me uml just because 
I 
vould not take her out 
To balls and parties und all dot, 
Vich I 
dought vas a 
sin, 
But now I've got a 
new sweetheart, 
Und she is awful thin. 
CHORUS. 
She is so thin, dot vere she here, 
You could not see her; 
don't dot seem queer? 
Bad luck have I— oh, I 
shall die, 
My vive is so awfully thin. 
Vere I 
first met dis female straw, 
'Dwas at a 
coundry fair. 
She VOS valking long mit her mamma, 
Und she had such nice blonde hair; 
I 
spoke to her, she spoke to me, 
Ye got acquainted den, 
Ye married vere, und after dot 
She commenced to grow thin. 
SPOREN.—She is the thinnest of the thin. 
She used to vork 
in an insdrument factory, cleaning out flutes; I 
used to play 
" 
Hide und Seek" mit her. und see used to hide in de gas pipe. 
I 
took her oud riding vonce, mid I 
grabbed her instead of de 
whip; I 
never took her °lid after dot. 
I 
vos valtzing mit her 
at a 
ball vonce, und de floor manager come up 'Ind said, " Young 
man, you ' ill have to leave your cane in de hat room, it's not 
allowed on de floor! 
I 
told him 'twas no cane, but my vife. 
De oder day vile ye vas oud valking, I 
saw a 
man selling leetle 
red balloons for ten cends; I 
bought vone, und give it to her 
to hold—she vent up, balloon und all: I 
haven't seen her since, 
but— 
She is so thin.

'Und people dey vould laugh at her venever she'd valk oud; 
But scull I

I 
dought dot in de future she vould gradually grow thin. 
CHORUS. 
She vas so stolid yen she'd valk oud, 
People vould dink dot she vos a 
balloon 
To take dem'up—just like a " scup," 
Und make a 
small call on de man in de moon. 
She looked just like an elephant, she had such a 
bigiear, 
But she could valk as lightly as any person here ; 
'Co tell you all aboud her, I 
now intend to try, 
Und vile I 
am a- speaking, I 
hope you viii not cry. 
SPOKEN.- 111 never forget ven I 
firsd got acquainted mit 
her, she vos travelling mit a 
circus, she vos de fat voman, she 
veiglied eight hundred pounds; I 
used to call her " Birdie!" 
her right name vos " Ostrich." I 
took her oud sleigh-riding 
vonce, she got in, und there vas just room for me to " cut on 
behind." 
I 
looked like an icicle on a 
gutter. 
Ye drove out on 
the road, und stopped in front of a 
hotel, the proprietor came 
ouch und toll me to move avay, as no vone could see de hotel 
vile she stayed dere. 
I 
took her bathing vonce, the moment 
she got in de vater, de tide vent up three foot, she asked me to 
float her; I 
tried to, but came near drowning; I 
told her I 
vos 
no derrick! 
But she could dance like a fairy—dot is a 
fairy 
her size; I 
used, in valtzing, to put my arm around her vaist 
as far as I 
could, und reach mit a 
boat-hook the rest of the dis-
tance; und she vos an awful eater, she could eat a 
vater-melon 
just as easy as I 
vould take a 
pill. 
I 
took the size of her finger 
vonce to have an engagement ling made; I 
vent down to the 
jeweller. I 
said, " Make me a 
ring dig size, und I 
vant it to lit 
yell." 
lie said, " Bring de keg down here, und let me fit it 
on." I 
don't speak to her now, because she vanted me to 
take her to a 
masquerade ball disguised as a 
pipe stem. I 
knew dot every vone vould laugh at me if I 
done so, for 
She vos so stoud, etc.

And this fairy little queen is only seventeen.

Her style is very neat, and she has such tiny feet.

Cease thy weeping, sadden'd heart, 
Brighter days are on the way, 
And the clouds so drear and dark, 
All will surely pass away. 
Flow'rs of spring will come again, 
Blooming sweetly o'er the lea, 
And the warblers of the grove 
Songs of love will chant for thee. 
Cnont -s. 
Oh, cease thy weeping sadden'd heart, 
Drive away all idle fears, 
Let those clouds of grief and care 
Melt away in silent tears. 
Cease thy weeping sadden'd heart, 
Why thy face so wan and pale, 
Has thy friend in death been laid 
'Neath the grasses of the vale? 
Ah! there is a 
fairer land, 
Where we meet no more to part, 
Let this cheer thee, gentle one, 
Let this soothe thy sadden'd heart. 
Oh, cease thy weeping, & c. 
Cease thy weeping sadden'd heart. 
Has thy loved one prov'd untrue, 
Has he broken every vow 
That he promis'd only you ? 
Weep not for him gentle maid, 
He who would both woo and win, 
Then turn traitor to his word, 
Deep has drank of darker sins. 
Oh, cease thy weeping, Sze.

I'm going to wed a 
nice young lass, 
In beauty none can her surpass; 
You may search the country all around, 
You'll not find one one like Susan Brown. 
Oh, I 
love Sue, and Sue loves me, 
We're happier than king or queen can be; 
But Sue, you must know, has a 
curious way, 
For when I 
go to kiss her she will always say: 
CHORUS. 
Oh! dear me, let me be, 
Get away, do, oh! don't tickle me; 
• 
Now then, Ted, stop your chaff, 
He, he, he, he, oh! you make me laugh 
I 
never shall the day forget, 
The first time I 
and Susan met; 
She was milking on a 
three legged stool) 
I 
called her duck, she called me fool. 
She gave me such a 
slap in the face, 
But I 
didn't mind that for I 
wanted to taste 
Her sweet pretty lips, like the roses so red, 
But when I 
went to kiss her, how she screamed and said: 
Oh! dear, etc. 
I 
said " I'll have one kiss," and then 
My 4rm went round her waist again; 
She shouted " Oh ! I 
feel so queer," 
She scratched my face and pulled my ear. 
But I 
held fast and declared that I 
Would either have a 
kiss or die; 
She said, " Well then, Ted, if you'll let me be, 
Just take one, ducky darling, but don't tickle me." 
Oh 
dear me, etc. 
(Encore 
Verse.) 
I'm married now and settled down, 
With my dear darling, Susan Brown; 
We are happy as a 
pair can be, 
And toss the babies on our knee. 
But when I 
chance to come home late at night, 
She's bound to catch me, and oh 1 
what a 
plight; 
For Susan don't stop to consider my plea, 
But with a 
pair of flat- irons she tickles me. 
Oh! dear MO, etc.

PAPA SAYS I 
MAY." 
CAPTAIN SPIKE OF THE MUSKETEERS. 
Ladies' beautiful serio comic song—composed and sung 
Iw nor.LIN HOWARD, in his great impersonation of " Mlle 
DESERTL," the Prima Donna, in his play of BAFFLED.

I've reigned with queenly sway: 
Though my Mother says I

My Papa says I

SO

Ma's cross the live long day ; 
Though my Mother says I

With all the fashion's capers ; 
But I'll not tell, 'twill be told so well

Oh! I'm a

Just from the war where the banners wave; 
I'll fight as long as I 
can see, 
Or stand behind a 
barn or tree. 
You bet I 
am a 
handsome man, 
And when I 
went away, 
It nearly broke the ladies' hearts; 
But now they often say. 
Oh myl they cry, Oh! who is he ?

KEEP ON KISSING ME 
Written and Arranged by Rol.z.nz HOWARD. 
MUSIC 
copyrighted 1818, and published by F. BLUME, 861 
Broadway. New York. 
Price 35 cents. 
Well there, now! did you ever ? 
Ma says I'm dreadful bold, 
Because when men come courting, 
I'm 
ot resery'd or cold. 
Now, gents, pray tell me, would you have me 
Make a 
face that's wry ? 
Or when you ask me once to kiss you, 
Like a 
fool to cry ? 
SPOKEN.—No, no I 
I'm sure you would rather I'd say 
CHORUS. 
Keep on kissing me, keep on kissing me, 
Bless me, Bob, don't be so shy; 
Keep on kissing me, keep on kissing me, 
Once more only love to try; 
Keep on kissing me, keep on kissing me, 
'Tis the height of true love's bliss ; 
Keep on kissing me, keep on kissing me, 
No joy equals love's fond kiss. 
Bob says not to mind mother, 
When she was young like me 
She ne'er tho't men a 
bother, 
Or married would not be; 
And so I 
thought if men would follow, 
I'd not say them nay. 
Nor for my mother, or any other, 
Bid them turn away. 
SPOKEN.—But I've made up my mind that when the right one 
comes along, I'll say   
Keep on kissing me, etc. 
25 
I 
think that Bob means business, 
Tho' not much yet he's said, 
But truly, from his actions, 
I 
think lie means to wed. 
Now should he ask me if I'll have him, 
I'll not bid him wait, 
And say the sea holds plenty fishes, 
For oft we lose our bait. 
SPOKEN.—Oh, yes, I 
tell you, these giddy girls who keep 
saying, " There's just as good fish in the sea as ever were 
caught!" they forget that sometimes they lose their bait. 
Not 
for me! 
Oh, no! 
I'll continue saying — 
Keep on kissing me, etc. 
As sung by BILLY PASTOR. 
If you perceive my bosom heave, 
'TiS caused by prou I 
delight, 
For I'm a 
very different man 
To what I 
was last night. 
For some time in my house a 
nurse 
Has aired her awkward charms, 
But, I'm glad to say, this morning 
I've found something in her arms. 
SPOYEN.—I 
said to the nurse in a 
very innocent sort of a 
manner : " Why, laws, missy, what have you got in your 
arms ?" She placed her finger on her lips and said, " h—s—h— 
CHORUS. 
Don't make a 
noise or else you'll wake the baby, 
Don't make a 
noise or else you'll wake the child; 
Don't kick up a 
row or else you'll disturb the infant," 
I 
feel so awfully awfully jolly, I 
think I 
shall go 
wild 
As soon as e'er the news spread 'round, 
In every neighbor comes; 
Some said " what a 
darling child !" 
And others " Bless its gums!" 
My feelings were so glorious, 
Describe them no one can, 
And the ladies seem to look on me 
As a 
very clever man. 
SPOREN.—"Why," said they, "JP. Snooks, Mr. Snooks, ycrts 
ought to be a 
very happy man;" " I 
am, /am!" I 
17;plied, ana 
I 
would have given away to my feelings and kicked up a 
row, only for the nurse, in her suggestive manner, said 
" 
h—s—h— 
To-day I 
married, so was Jones, 
Who said, quite on the sly— 
" 
Who'll be a 
happy father first, 
I 
wonder, you or I?" 
Jones always thinks he's No. 1, 
But to-day that bliss is mine, 
And when we meet, we'll have some fun, 
I'll crack a 
case of wine. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, and I'll 
make Jones drink the darling's 
health, and while he's drinking I'll say, " Jonesey, old boy, 
With a 
parent's fond affection now, 
I 
feel all of a 
glow, 
But what to call the lovely babe, 
I 
don't exactly know. 
I'd like to call him something grand, 
And worthy of a 
Snooks, 
And when he's christened you must come 
And F,%:e how nice he looks. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, I'll invite you all to attend the christening, 
but remember, h—s—h— 
Don't make a 
noise, &c. 
OH, WINE! GLORIOUS WINE! 
Sung by ELLA W ESNER. 
Let brightest wine sparkle 
Upon the gay board, 
The glorious vintage 
The vine does afford. 
'Twill give joy and pleasure, 
Renewing life's spring— 
Then drink—never measure, 
And merrily sing. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, wine! Glorious wine! 
What do the Poet's say ? 
What do we all say ? 
Oh, wine! Glorious wine I 
Give it us old or new. 
Let hermits and others, 
Drink of the cold spring; 
Wine makes us all brothers, 
And each man a 
king. 
For, while we are quaffing 
The ruby-red wine, 
We feel more than mortal, 
And almost divine. 
Oh, wine ! Glorious wine & c. 
Boys, fill up your glassez.. 
Be all hand-and-glove, 
Drink to the fair lasses— 
To honor, and love. 
With good wine before us, 
And music and song, 
Let this be our chorus, 
As time flies along: 
Oh, wine! Glorious wine, &c.,. 
Bright wine makes victorious 
he bold and, the brave; 
Rho rails 'gainst Bacchus, 
I'll hold him a 
knave. 
Away with all sorrow, 
Let trouble take wing, 
A 
fig for to-morrow, 
To-night let us sing:

JUST A LITTLE TOO FAR. 
Written and Sung by BEN DODGE. 
I 
suppose you have noticed some folks are peculiar 
And never can they well enough let alone, 
But matters still push of results irregardless, 
Until every prospect completely has flown. 
Advice that is given they pass quite unheeded, 
They think they've been born ' neath some bright lucky star„ 
Until when to the fact I 
have named they awaken 
And find they have gone just a 
little too far. 
Now the big ferry line which leads over to Brooklyn 
Has adopted a 
scheme the newsboys to defeat, 
And also prevent them from retailing tickets, 
While honestly earning their bread in the street. 
The ferries are owned by a 
rich corporation; 
For the poor children's suffering they don't seem to care— 
The greater their wealth the more grasping their natures, 
But I 
think they have gone just a 
little too far. 
We've been bothered some time with an Excise Commission, 
Whose actions I 
think you'll pronounce very queer, 
They have strained every point to refuse dealers license

Now there Henry Ward Beecher our most noted preacher, 
Who was foolish enough but last summer to say, 
That a 
poor laboring man should provide for his family 
Upon the small sum of a 
dollar a 
day, 
But if ever he practiced the doctrine he preaches, 
A 
great change would sure come to this divine star, 
And as he was feasting upon " bread and water" 
He'd find he had gone just a 
little too far. 
I 
suppose the old " Tammany Ring" is forgotten 
Which once ran New York in its own private way, 
But the justice adminstered unto its leaders 
Has been badly mixed I 
am sorry to say; 
Genet, and Sweeney are taking things easy, 
With no chilling prospect their pleasures to mar, 
While generous old Bill Tweed is lying in prison. 
Now I 
think this has gone altogether too far. 
Last evening I 
got myself into a 
pickle, 
When my hearts dearest object I 
dropped in to sea. 
On the sofa together we were cozily sitting 
And I 
am afraid I 
was almost too free, 
For she sprang to her feet with her eyes fairly blazing, 
Said she '' you just skip' or I'll call my papa." 
I 
tried hard to square it but she would'nt have it, 
She said •` I 
had gone just a 
little too far."

THE HERALD COMPLAINT soot 
A new idea for a 
song, taken from the column in the N. Y 
Herald, called the " Complaint Book," written by TONY 
PASTOR, and sung by PRANK LEWIS. 
The hit 
of the season at the Academy 
of 
Music, Pittsburg. 
Of course in search of novelties are people now-a- days, 
New subjects they are sure to find in novels, songs and plays: 
But if in search of something new, you only have to look 
And read the various grumbles in the Herald " Complaint 
Book." 
SPOKEN.—This is from a 
gentleman who takes his meals out— 
Mr. Editor, in the restaurant where I 
make my daily calls, 
I 
fonnd an India rubber shoe in one of my codfish balls; 
Now, will I 
sue the proprietor, or will I 
punch the cook ? 
Or will 
show the rascal up in the Herald " Complaint Book ?" 
SPOKEN.—In regards to the stage— 
There's a 
question I 
would like to ask, and an answer I 
expect, 
Why Mabel Leonard from the stage they forclbly eject? 
While the ragged urchins on the street they quietly overlook, 
Our Commissioners should look after them. 
Put that down on 
the book. 
SPOKEN.—From a 
respectable married lady— 
I've been married now five years or more, and have neither 
kith nor kin, 
And in the shape of a 
family there's nothing yet been seen; 
While Mrs. Jones, across the way, on a 
pair of twins can look, 
Won't some one stir my husband up in the Herald " Complaint 
Book ?" 
ROCKAWAY, 
Written by Ell. HARRIGAN for DICK PARKER. 
I 
took my gal last Friday fair 
To the Irish Saratoga, 
She'd a 
bathing suit and a 
Dutch spitz dog, 
With a 
head like a 
Russian Czar; 
She wanted to swim in the briny sea, 
She's big as a 
bale of hay, 
I 
made the trip to give her a 
dip 
On the beach at Rockaway. 
We soon got afloat on the Plymouth Rock boat, 
She squatted right down in the bow, 
She eat two hams and a 
hamper of clams— 
That's more than the law would allow; 
She began for to kick when she got sea-sick, 
The first thing I 
heard a 
sailor say— 
" 
Give her ipecac and let's put back, 
Or we'll sink ' fore we reach Rockaway." 
When we got to the beach she began for to screech— 
" 
Look out there I 
I'm going to make a 
dive! ' 
She dove on a 
Mick—he gave his last kick, 
As he plumb into China did drive; 
All day she did swim, she wouldn't come in, 
" 
She'll drown!" the people did say, 
She sunk like a 
stone, and left me alone, 
On the beach at Rockaway. 
She floated ashore, and a 
fat coroner, 
Twelve sailors and an Italian band, 
Sat on her all day, and the verdict they say 
Was, she died ' cause she couldn't live on land; 
Pooty soon she come to, saying, Richard, where are 
on 
Oh I 
lovey, take me home on a 
dray, 
I'm sweet sixteen, feed me on cream, 
Clams are too tough at Rockaway. 
RIDING ON THE RAILWAY. 
Written by D. A. 
KELLY. 
Sung by COLLYER .SL 
KELLY. 
While riding on the railway ears the other day, 
A 
very funny incident happened by the way; 
-A woman, with a 
large market basket on her arm, 
Got on at a 
way station, convenieht to a 
farm. 
She put the basket under a 
seat, and then she raised her vail, 
And turning to me, asked Is this the Morning Mail ? 
tow her that it was, and settled for a 
nap, 
When suddenly in my face I 
felt a 
most tremendous slap. 
CHORES. 
In the railway to the north, let it hail, rain, or snow, 
Along the iron railway, like lightening we go. 
That a 
man should be blamed for what he does not do 
Is certainly very hard, which I 
now will show to you. 
I 
turned to the lady, and inquired the cause. 
You dirty loaferI she says to me. Its very well you knows ; 
You ought to be ashamed of yourself, to treat a 
lady so. 
Says I, Madam. what I'm guilty of I'm sure I 
do not know. 
She sat down in her seat, then rose again in haste, 
And says, Is there a 
gentleman will save me from this baste ? 
Or bring me a 
policeman, for sure as eggs is eggs, 
I'll have this brute arrested for tickling of my legs. 
In the railway etc. 
The color rose to my cheeks, I 
swore it wasn't so, 
And asked if anyone would for the Conductor go. 
The Conductor he arrived, asked for an explanation. 
The old lady told her story, without any hesitation. 
The Conductor tried to calm her—she. was at fever heat— 
She wouldn't listen to him till he pulled from under the seat 
Her great big market basket, and then, how very shocking! 
Discovered a 
big rooster, who'd been picking at her stocking. 
Cuotics. 
Tn the railway, to the north, let it hail, rain, or snow, 
Along the iron railway, like lightening.we go. 
That a 
man should be blamed for what he does not do 
Ts certainly very hard, 
I 
tow have showu to you.

Did You Ever See an Oyster Walk Dpstairs, 
Written by F. Guaugnt 
I 
LOVE a 
very handsome girl with gleaming golden hair, 
My charmer will not marry me, she daily does declare: 
Upon my knees she asks me to, but in a 
knowing way,— 
She slyly shakes her saucy head, and then to me does say— 
CitoRus. 
Did you ever see an oyster walk up stairs? 
Walk up stairs ? walk up stairs? 
Well, when you do, I'll marry you and share your cares, 
But not before you see an oyster walk up stairs. 
I've got a 
nicely furnished house, a 
few pounds in the bank, 
My friends assure me that I 
am good tempered, gay and frank; 
All this I 
tell my darling, but her love I 
cannot gain, 
She shuts her eyes and then replies in this annoying strain— 
Did you ever, Sc.c. 
Fine satins, silks and laces rich, I 
say that she shall wear. 
If willing but to marry me, to buy them all I 
swear; 
To operas and theatres I 
promise she shall go, 
But still elleD.sks the question, and so slyly wants to know.. 
It I 
ever saw, &c. 
To all the oyster shops in town, I 
sadly wend my way, 
To Billingsgate I 
often go, as well as to Herne Bay; 
In hope to find an oyster that will undertake the task, 
But everybody laughs at me when dolefully I 
ask— 
CHOR`cti. 
IlaVe you got a 
leetle native that ca. 
stairal 
Walk up-stairs ? 
wsolk al-stairs ? 
For if you have, she'll marry me and sham my cares, 
But not before you 0-7, 2D lystsr walk up stairs. 
This question I 
will maks rroi own, and use it when I 
can, 
No matter what the query is, I'll answer every mail; 
For instance, if my landlord calls, demanding six month's zut 
say, "Old boy, you'll get it, if you witness the event"— 
C 
HORUS. 
The day ar, arm' oyster walks up stairs ? 
Walks up stairs? 
walks up stairs? 
For when you do, I'll pay it you, and ease your cares, 
Bat not before you see an oyster walk up stairs. 
ONE summer night some time ago, when birds had gone tc. 
Sleep, 
And little stars at heaven's gate came out to wink and peep; 
rue lilies and the pretty flowers wafted sweet perfume, 
A 
shepherd's pipe was heard afar, to play this pretty tune. 
CHORUS. 
While standing at the gate with Ada, 
While standing at the gate with Ada, 
While standing at the gate with Ada, 
One evening rather late, 
r 
press'd her hand beneath the tree, the lilac kissed her cheek 
Her pouting lips were just apart, her sigh was soft and sweet; 
The odor of her balmy breath was like sweet Indian spice, 
I 
stole a 
sweet enchanting kiss, I 
might have stole it thrice. 
While standing at the gate with Ada, &c. 
A. naughty bee out rather late, that moment by me flew, 
And his style quite plainly told he had been drinking dew; 
So deeming us too near his house, my cheek he quickly stung 
And as he flew into his hive right merrily he sung. 
While standing at the gate with Ada, &c. 
I 
bade my love a 
sweet good night, the hour was growing late, 
She press'd her lips against my cheek, and closed the wicket 
rrate • 
Click, went the latch, the door it creaked, I 
sighed, good night 
fair maid, 
A.nd to my love my own fond dove, I 
breathed this serenade. 
I'm waiting at the gate for Ada, &c. 
SOlVIETHING IN VIE CITY. 
Sung with great success by W ILL II. 
MORTON, with Harrigan 
and Hart's Combination. 
I 
live up town in Harlem, 
Every morning out I 
crawl, 
Perhaps I 
come to town, 
Perhaps don't come at all. 
My movements are uncertain, 
And curious folks I 
pity, 
For they would like to know quite well, 
What I 
do in the city. 
Spoken—My neighbors can't find out what I 
do for a 
living; 
they have all come to the conclusion, however, that I 
do— 
CHORUS. 
Something in the city, 
Something in the city, 
They don't know quite, they think they're right, 
Something in the city. 
(Repeat.) 
Some say that I'm a 
banker, 
Or deal in foreign wares, 
Some say that I'm a 
broker, 
Among the Bulls and Bears. 
Some say that I'm a 
lawyer, 
But all the maidens pretty, 
Think that I'm a 
preacher, or do 
Something in the city. 
Something, etc. 
Perhaps I 
meet with Smith, 
We talk about the weather, 
Up comes Brown (you all know Brown), 
We have a 
drink together. 
When I 
am gone, Brown says " who's he?" 
" 
That's Johnson, very witty," 
" 
What does h do?" " Bless me if I 
know, 
Spoken— Oh, yes l 
he does— 
Something in the city. 
Spoken—It's been remarked in my neghborhood that I 
VMS 
in the lottery business, and the young ladies they all say I'm 
on the press. 
But they are all wrong. 
Now I 
tell you confi-
dentially what I 
do for a 
living. 
Every time I 
go down town, 
I 
do—well— 
Something, etc. 
Wrinen and composed by JOHN READ. Arranged by H. W. FircHITT. 
Sung by TONY PASTOR. 
Some folks will cry " Oh I 
shame, Mrs. Jones, you are to blames 
I 
never should have thought it, ma'am, of you," 
While, if they'd look at home before abroad they'd roam, 
I'm positive they'd have enough to do. 
Mrs. Brown says it's a 
sin, that Mrs. Smith drinks gin, 
And harbors " tally-men" from day to day; 
While Mrs. Green was caught doing what she hadn't ought, 
When she in self defencs was heard to say— 
CHORUS. 
" 
They all do it, they all do it, 
They all do it, though ofttimes they rue It; 
Yet they all do it, they all do it, 
And so it will continue to the end of the world!" 
For ',lours three or four, lovers spooning at the door, 
On any moonlight evening may be seen; 
Though if they want a 
lark, they have it in the dark, 
And they " do it," though they say " they didn't mean," 
When creeping down the stairs, comes the old man unawareA 
And kissing catch the couple in the act; 
The mother,from above, says " Don't interfere, my love, 
You can't dispute this most important fact—" 
They all do it, etc. 
Old women do declare, girls should never dye their hair, 
And then again they say it's very wrong; 
Without the least restraint, their faces so to paint, 
And rob the easy chair for their chignon. 
Each girl a 
little puff, has inside a 
little muff, 
They are never seen without it, night or day; 
And her pretty nose she'll powder, if a 
moment is allowed her, 
When, if you laugh, she'll innocently say— 
They all do it, etc, 
But what does most impress, is the style in which they dress, 
It's enough to make you laugh when them you see; 
They've a 
hat upon their heads, large enough to make up beds, 
For pussy cats with kittens two or three. 
In their panniers, too, behind, if examined you would find, 
The most important papers of the day; 
The Chronicle and Chimes, the Telegraph and Times, 
Or anything that chance puts in their way. 
They all do it, etc. 
There's my neighbor, Dinah Down, brught two lovely boys to 
town, 
And her husband gets but one pound one per week; 
You often hear him say, " If things go on this way, 
We'll a 
lodging in the Union have to seek! 
For the doctor and the nurse, will drain my scanty purse, 
With many more expenses to defray;" 
Then he gets into a 
passion, when they tell him " it's the 
fashion," 
And they soothe him as they sing this truthful lay— 
They all do it, etc. 
Sung nightly for nearly four months, by HARRY MoNrAntirs, 
with overwhelming applause, at three of the leading varier 
theatres in New York. 
DID you ever make love? 
If not, have a 
try, 
I 
courted a 
girl once, so bashful and shy, 
A 
fair little creature who by the by, 
At coaxing ana teasing had such a 
nice way; 
Now every night to her house I 
went, 
In harmless delight our evenings were spent, 
But she had a 
queer saying, whatever it meant, 
For whenever I 
entered her house she would say 
Spoken—Charley, dear, before you take, a 
seat, won't you 
please go and 
CHORUS 
Pull down the blind, pull down the 
Pull down the 
lind, love, come don't be urikine... 
Though we're alone, bear this in mind, 
Somebody's looxing, low, pull down the blind. 
Dow loving we were, how cosy we'd chat, 
'Bout one thing and Vother, and this Juing ard that, 
With my arm round her waist -row ;osy we at 
Like two little iurtie-aoves perched on a 
tree 
‘7•ucti squeezing and teasing and pleasing we had— 
c.luch billing and cooing that make our hearts glad, 
With laughing and chaffing I 
near drove her mad. 
But sti') s was awfully s- cet ni me,

Sp'oken.—Well, I 
should. say so; I 
cut her other beau out al• 
together, so one night when we were alone in the front parlor, slie 
saw this other beau go past the window, so she drew up very 
close to me, and whispered— 
Pull down the blind, ,te 
One night, for a 
change, to the theatre we went 
And when we got home she was very content, 
She saw them make love, and so learned the way, 
The piece was " Claude Melnotte," and suited her fine. 
She called me her rose-bud, her duck and her dear, 
She threw her arms round me, while fast fell each tear; 
She cried, oh, don't leave me, for sadly I 
fear 
You don't love me truly, say, will you be mine? 
Spoken.—Yes, I 
popped the question to her right then and 
there, aLd dc you know at that highly interesting moment, just 
as I 
asked this fair creature to marry me, there was a 
police-
man went past, sc she drew up a 
little closer, and put her cl)ar 
arms arouna my neck, and looked up into my face with all her 
innocent simplicity, and simpered out, " Well Charley, if I 
marry 
you, yoi won't abuse me, will you ?" * Abusc you, why bless

THE HANDSOME LOVER, 
trug, by SALLIE PRIMROSE, in" Charlotte Temple.' 
There's a 
handsome young lover in town that T 
know, 
He's the prettiest fellow I 
know for a 
beau ; 
But he falls in love with each face that he sees, 
And that, if I 
marry, will sure make a 
breeze. 
I 
love him 'tis true, but what can I 
say, 
If his love for another comes into my way? 
I'll be angry enough to tear out his eyes, 
And all hi -> good looks I 
shall surely despise. 
Well, I'll give him a 
trial, and if he don't mend, 
As I, such a 
Tartar, he never could find; 
give him soft words and love's sweetest smile, 
And try with love's arts all his hours to beguile; 
And then should another e'en daie to intrude, 
'Round his ears such a 
tempest will gather, so rude, 
He'll declare, since the world by a 
deluge was drown'd 
Like me, not another on earth could be found,

Rollin Iltward's " Gem" Medley. 
Introducing his famous u 
You'll never miss the Water 'till 
the Well runs Dry."—As sung by him in his 
great play entitled " BAFFLED." 
There's a 
letter in the candle, 
It points direct to me ; 
How the little spark is shining ; 
From whomever can it be ? 
It gets brighter still, and brighter, 
Like a 
little sunny ray; 
And I 
dare to guess the writer, 
For it drives suspense away. 
Bright spark of hope, 
Shed your beams on me, 
And send a 
loving message 
From far across the sea, 
Bright spark of hope, 
Shed your beams on me, 
And send a 
loving message—From--
The little log cabin in the lane ! 
Ah ! yes, I 
am old and feeble now, my head is bending low, 
And I 
never more shall hoe the corn again! 
Yet the Angels they will lead me, when my time has come to 
Dance in the dreamy waltz, 
Beautiful, sweet and dreamy waltz, 
As round and round 
To sweet languid strains we whirl ; 
Dancing in the dreamy waltz, 
Beautiful, sweet and dreamy waltz ; 
Oh! the joys of dancing, 
In the dreamy waltz! 
51 
Then there is no harm in kissing, 
Pray tell me, is there dear ? 
Those rosy lips invite me now, 
And no one lingers near! 
Then loving ones are meeting— 
No prying eyes to mark— 
There is no harm in kissing, 
At twilight in the 
ark !— 
But—Wait ' till the moonlight falls on the water, 
Then take your sweetheart out for a 
walk ; 
Mind what you say. boys ; that's how to court her ; 
Tell het that you will wed her when the days grow short 
Then she'll say—Oh ! aint yon awful ! 
It's wrong you know to teaze me so ; 
Oh ! flint you horrid, 
You naughty, wicked man ! 
As we sat by the river, you and I, 
In the sweet summer time, long ago, 
Sc) smoothly the water glided by. 
Mak ng music in its tranquil flow. 
We threw two 1.aftets, you and I, 
To the river, as it wandered on ; 
And one was rent and left to die, 
And the other floated forward all alone, 
And, oh! we were sadden'd, you and I, 
For we felt that our youth's golden dream 
Might fade, and our lives be sever'd, soon 
As the two leaves were parted— As — 
The birds sleeping gently, 
Sweet Lyra gleameth bright; 
Her rays tinge the forest, 
And all seems glad to-night; 
The wind's sighing by me, 
Cooling my feverish brow; 
The stream flows as ever, 
Yet, Alice where art thou? 
One year back, this even, 
And thou wert by my side 
Vowing to love the. 
One year past, this even, 
And thou wert by my side— 
Vowing to—Love me once again, 
Meet me once aga'm; 
Old love is waiting, shall it wait in vain ? 
When a 
child I 
liv'd at Lincoln with my parents on the 
farm 
The lessons that my mother taught to me were quite a 
charm ; 
She would often take me on her knee, when tired of *
child-
ish play, 
And as she pressed me to her breast, I've heard my mother 
say :— 
Waste not, want not, is a 
maxim I 
would teach, 
Let your watchword be, dispatch, and practice what you 
preach ; 
Do not let your chances, like sunbeams, pass you by, 
For " You never miss the water 'till the well runs dry I'

QUEER sayings now are all the rage, 
We've new ones every day: 
Pve heard folks cry, " I'll have your hatl'' 
And, " What will mother say!" 
But the latest I'll now give to you, 
Which causes me much strife, 
For whenQ'er I'm out the urchins shout—

I 
went to Long Branch for a 
week, 
To have a 
change of air, 
Whilst strolling there upon the sands, 
I 
met a 
damsel fair, 
"

ride," said she,

When a

met, 
It rained in torrents as she did

When a 
chap who played a

Said—" Please to spare a

I'll tell, &743. 
My temper it does agitate, 
Whene'er that threat I

Those urchins—if they don't desist, 
Will drive me to my bier (

Kind friends, myself on you I 
throw, 
But pray don't tell my wife, 
If I 
should sing another song, 
Or it may cause more strife.

TWO ORPHANS, 
Composed and sung by P. J. 
DOWNEY, 
Air.—" Over the Hills to the Poor- House." 
The evening's bright stars they were shining, 
The moonbeams shone clear on our land, 
Our city was in peace and quietness, 
The hour of midnight near at hand. 
But hark! do you hear that cry? 
Fire ! 
How dismal those bells they do sound; 
Our Brooklyn Theatre is burning ! 
Alas, burning fast to the ground. 
CHORUS. 
We ne'er can forget the " Two Orphans," 
Bad luck seems to be in its wake, 
It seems it were brought to our city. 
The lives of our dear friends to take,. 
The doors they ware open at seven, 
The curtain was rolled up at eight; 
Them that had got seats they w re happy, 
Outside they were mad that were late. 
The play it went on very smoothly, 
Till sparks from the scenes they did fly; 
It's then that men, women and children, 
" 
Oh, God save our lives !" they did cry, 
Wt ne'er can. etc. 
Next morn in amongst those black ruins, 
Oh, God! what a 
sight met our eyes 
The dead they were lying in all shapes, 
Some there that none could recognize. 
Poor mothers there weeping and crying, 
For sons that were out all that night; 
Oh, God! let their souls rest in heaven, 
Amongst the innocent and bright. 
We ne'er 3an, eta. 
What means this large gathering of people, 
Upon such a 
cold dreary day? 
Or what means this long line of hearses, 
With tops plumed in feathery array. 
Far out to the cemetery of Greenwood, 
Where the 'wind makes the lone willow sigh, 
'Tis there where the funeral is going, 
The poor unknown dead there to lie. 
We ne'er can. etc. 
Written by HARRY BENNETT, 
Expressly for BRYANT & 
When twilight falls so soft and sweet, 
And silent is the hiur, 
My charming girl I 
long to meet, 
Within some leafy bower, 
And whisper sweet tales in her ear, 
And promises so true. 
To me she is the one most dear, 
My little bright-eyed Lou. 
CHORUS. 
(Tweak.) Her dancing smiles they seem to cheer my heart. ( Sym.) 
(Break.) I'm sorely wounded with little cupid's dart. 
Her smiles will ever cheer my way, 
She's loving, kinthand true. 
I'm waiting for that happy day, 
I'll wed my bright-eyed Lou. 
Her voice is full of melody, 
Her lips are rosy red. 
She wears a 
jaunty little hat 
Upon her darling head; 
A cunning little foot, Oh, my! 
The size is number two, 
'Tis all these charms that make me love 
My 
little bright eyed Lou. 
(
Break.) 
Her dancing smiles, &c.

EYES OF SPARKLING BRIGHTNESS. 
ORIGINAL SONG AND DANCE . 
Written and sung by the GIRARD BROTHERS. 
Those eyes of sparkling brightness, 
How they haunt us in our dreams, 
They're as bright as flowing ripples, 
Beneath the sun's bright beams ; 
Like dew- drops on the meadow, 
At morning's dawning hour, 
We feel within our heart and soul, 
Love's own sweet magic power. 
Over vale and mountain, (
sym.) 
Violets and fountains, (
sym.) 
Then we'll sing the praise of summer days, 
Of eyes that sparkle bright, 
Through weal or woe, where'er we go, 
They fill us with delight. 
When the nightingale is singing 
Her songs upon the lea, 
We hear sweet voices ringing, 
Of nature gay and free ; 
When the sun shines on the river, 
And the shadow's on the hill, 
We'll dream of thee though far away, 
Those eyes will haunt us still. 
Over vale, etc.

ever written, proving " truth stranger than fiction." The poet' 
lime

And virtue warmed her heart. 
But, ah! the cruel spoiler came—"

that vice, however prosperous in the beginning, in the end only leads 
to misery and shame."

Courting Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
So meet a 
want frequently felt by young people-a want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a way as to be non-committaL 
Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too diffi. 
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
front doing anything that would seem to be an unlady-like encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many 
lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of quostions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties
