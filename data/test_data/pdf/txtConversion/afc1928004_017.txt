JEFF DAVIS.. 
Sung by Mr. Tom D ONNELLY, Comedian. Music published at 
Burnton's, 241 Hudson street ( copyright). 
Oh! once I 
could ate my fill of good mate, 
And whisky galore I 
could rowl into me ; 
I 
could streel up and down every street in the town, 
With always a 
quarter to go on the spree. 
My clothes they were good, shure I 
ne'er thought of 
wood, 
A 
pick, or a 
spade, never entered my mind; - 
But now I'm in grief, since that black- hearted thief, 
Jeff Davis, he brought these hard times upon me. 
CHORUS: 
Bad luck to him early, bad luck to him dearly, 
May the divil admire him, where'er he may be; 
May rattle- snakes smite him, and mosquitoes bite him, 
The traitor that brought these hard times upon me. 
Oh ! I 
walk up and down every street in this town, 
But the divil a 
smell of a 
glass can I 
get ; 
I 
go everywhere to ease my despair, 
And the hunger, begor, keeps me in a 
big sweat ; 
Of my clothes, there's as much as would boulster a 
crutch; 
And my shirt wants a 
rivet or two in each seam ; 
May the hangman be brief when he hangs that ould 
thief 
Jeff Davis, that brought these hard times upon me. 
Bad luck to him early, &o: 
6 
THE FRISKY IRISH SONGSTER. 
So badly I'm broke I 
can't raise a 
smoke, 
Not even a 
chaw can I 
find in the street; 
Not a 
stump of cigar, though I 
search near and far— 
They're made into cloth, faith, it is my belief; 
The oyster bay swells sometimes gives me shells 
To polish my teeth on, be way of a 
smack ; 
Oh! my stomach gets rily, and then I 
curse wildly 
Jeff Davis, that brought these hard times on my back. 
Bad luck to him early, &c. 
Oh ! I'll spit in my fist, and then I'll enlist, • 
And off to the wars I'll march bould as brass ; 
I'll fight till I 
die, and e'er I 
will fly, 
I'll measure the length of myself on the grass; 
Like a 
brigadier private I'll march on the foe, 
I'll slather the rebels wherever I 
go. 
Oh! ' tis then I'll knock blazes out of Jefferson Davis, 
The traitor that brought these hard times upon me. 
Bad luck to him early, &c. 
THE YOUNG VOLU1NTEER. 
Composed for, and sung by Fred May, in the National Theatre, 
Boston, & c. &e. 
Dear Jane, I bid you adieu, 
For I 
am off to the wars; 
My Country calls on her sons 
To fight in a 
glorious cause. 
Then I 
will shoulder my gun, 
And leave all's dear to me ; 
And hie away to the wars, 
To fight for the flag of the free. 
Cnonrs—Then I 
will shoulder my gun, &c. 
Dear Jane, I 
bid you adieu, 
But, ah! ' twill be with a 
sigh! 
'Tis duty calls me away, 
So, Jane, my darling, good bye. 
THE FRISKY IRISH SONGSTER. 
For I 
will shoulder my gun, 
And leave all's dear to me; 
My duty calls me away, 
To fight for the flag of the free. 
Ah! I 
can never look on, 
And see the dread traitor's band 
Crush out the rights of the free, 
In this my own native land. 
So I 
must shoulder my gun, 
And leave all's dear to me; 
And hie away to the wars, 
To rescue the flag of the free. 
I 
pray that I 
may return 
To my home and those that I 
love; 
If not, I 
hope I 
shall meet 
You all in the bright land above. 
Farewell! Farewell! I 
now go, 
And leave all's dear to me; 
My country calls on her sons 
To fight for the flag of the free. 
THE WILD IRISHMAN. 
As sung by Billy O'Neil, the Irish Comedian and Vocalist. 
'When first I 
arrived in America's town, 
To view this fine city of fame and renown ; 
So while on my way here, I 
chanced for to stop 
In a 
big open lot where they kept a 
gin shop. 
CHORUS.--111-tu-ri-ni-ah, ri-tu-ri-ni-ah. 
I 
walked into the shop, whin who did I 
spy 
But two bouncing bullys, a 
fighting hard by; 
Says I, my fine fellows lave off with your tricks, 
For it's old country fashion a 
boxing with sticks. 
Ri-tu-ri-ni-ah, ri-tu-;i-ni-ah.

THE FRISKY IRISH SONGSTIM. 
I 
looked all around me, whin I 
did see 
A 
tight Irish lad from my own country ; 
He axed me my name, put his hand on my back 
Says he, lock at him, Paddy McLaughlin, whack! 
Ri-tu-ri-ni-ah, ri-tu-ri-ni-ali. 
Says I 
to myself, I 
think I 
will try ; [eye. 
Says one, hould your gab, Pat, or I'll blackin your 
For fear of my eye, divil a 
word did I 
spake, 
But I 
thought that the sowl in my body would 
drake. 
Ri-tu-ri-ni-ah, ri-tu-ri-ni-ah. 
No sooner did I 
get the word of command, 
Than I 
held my shillelah fast in my right hand ; 
And the first clip I 
gave him ' twas over the head— 
Troth, you'd have taken your oath he'was seven 
months dead. 
Ri-tu-ri-ni-ah, 
It took but a 
minute to clear the whole green, 
But bad luck to the Bully was there to be seen ; 
Says one to the other, why don't you run quick, 
Don't you see the wild Irishman with a 
big stick. 
Ri-tu-ri-ni-ah, ri-tu-ri-ni-ah. 
BATCH OF CAKES. 
AIR—
Bow- wow-wow, 
This world is a 
baker shop in which are many cakes, 
sirs, 
And oftentimes a 
queer one does mother nature make, 
sirs ; 
At cakes let no one laugh or flout, for, with truth, It 
may be said, sirs, 
If it was not for cakes, how many would go without 
bread, sirs! 
Cuoaus.—Bow-wow-wow ! 
THE FRISMY IRISH SONGSTER.

A 
rich man is a 
plumb cake, that's very full of juice, 
sirs, 
A 
bachelor's a 
stale cake, kept till he's no use, sirs, 
A 
gentleman's a 
butter cake, a 
true friend's a 
heart 
cake, 
And he that's six feet high you can't call a 
short cake. 
Bow-wow-wow! 
A 
poet is a 
seedy cake that's often poor enough, sirs, 
An upstart, that's swelled with pride, is nothing but a 
puff, sirs, 
The bucks that range about, so smart, dress'd up like 
simple tonics, 
Why, Lord! they are no cake at all, they're only mac-
aronies. 
Bow- wow-wow ! 
A 
miser is a 
spicy cake that never gives a 
crumb, sirs, 
A 
bailiff is a 
hard cake if you get under his thumb, sirs, 
A 
sailor is a 
biscuit—a 
merry fighting soul, sirs, 
And if the sea was chancery, he ;-"
d 
be master of the rolls, 
sirs. 
Bow-wow-wow. 
The ladies, they are sugar cakes, dear creatures—now 
and then, sirs, 
They frown and look like frosty cakes, to tease and tor-
ture men, sirs. 
What cakes old maids are, to define is quite out of my 
power; 
They might do well for tea cakes, but they'd turn the 
milk all sour. 
Bow-wow-wow. 
A 
counselor's a 
flowery cake—a 
soft cake his client, 
A 
quaker is a 
stiff cake, the devil can't make him pliant, 
A 
soldier is a 
fighting cake, and here I 
need not note, 
sirs, 
McClellan is a 
tough (Jake, stuck in Jeff Davis' throat, 
sirs. 
Bow-wow-wow. 
•

TILE FRISKY IRISH SONGSTER . 
Since in this world, beyond all doubt, so many cakes 
there must be, 
I 
hope my little batch, just now, will make none of you 
crusty; 
For if I 
gain your kind applause, my efforts it will 
crown, sirs— 
So, pray, be kind, good, gentle folks, and let my cakes 
go down, sirs. 
Bow-wow-wow. 
THE NEW YORK VOLUNTEER. 
DEDICATED TO THE BRAVE SIXTY-NINTH. 
Composed and sung by THOS. D ONNELLY, Esq., Comedian and 
Vocalist. 
Ain—Whisky in the Jar. 
I 
am a 
gallant hero the Southerners ne'er could frighten, 
And all I 
want's a 
belly-full of drinking or of fightin'; 
I'd die to guard the Union, as that alone can save us, 
And I'd rather be a 
blind jackass than that damn fool, 
Jeff Davis. 
For the Stars and Stripes hurrah ! that's the flag to 
float o'er us; 
That's the flag to float o'er us, and guide us tro the 
fray. 
I 
wint down to Virginny, with.Corcoran's bould Haroes, 
To have a 
hand at skivering the Southern would-be 
Naroes. 
They say that one can lick us-flve, but tho' I'm rather 
lazy, 
I 
knocked blazes out of twelve of them, and done it 
mighty aisy. 
For the Stars and Stripes hurrah! that's the flag to 
float o'er us; 
That's the flag to float o'er us, and guide us tro the 
fray, 
TIIE FRISKY IRISII SONGSTER .

The rebels soon must yield; they cannot stand our 
banging, 
And Davis, Wise, and Beauregard will in the air be 
hanging; 
The Stars and Stripes will wave aloft, from Oregon to 
Maine, 
And while the sun shines o'er us, they'll ne'er come 
down again. 
For the Stars and Stripes hurrah! that's the flag to 
float o'er us; 
That's the flag to float o'er us, and guide us tro the 
fray. 
ENCORE VERSE. 
We'll make thim blackguards fly, like chaff before the 
wind, sir ; 
The devil as much as a 
grease spot of thim you'll ever 
find, sir, 
In Maryland, and New Orleans, and down to South Caro-
lina; 
We'll make Floyd pay back what he stole, and fork up 
all the Rhino. 
For the Stars and Stripes hurrah! that's the flag to 
float o'er us; 
That's the flag to float o'er us, and guide us tro the 
fray. 
THE WIDOW THAT KEEPS THE COCK INN. 
A 
traveler for many long years I 
have been, 
But I 
never went over to France ; 
Most cities and all market towns I've been in, 
From Berlek on Tweed to Penzance. 
Many hotels and taverns I've used in my time, 
And many fair landladys seen ; 
But of all the fair charmers who others outshine, 
Give me the the sweet widow— 
I 
mean the sweet widow that keeps the Co-± Inn.

THE FRISKY IRISH SONGSTER. 
Her lips are as rosy as e'en is her wine, 
And, like all her liquors, she's neat ; 
She's full of good spirits that's really divine, 
And while serving her bitters, looks sweet. 
Excuse these outpourings— they spring from the 
heart--
You may laugh, so shall I, if I 
win 
One smile of consent (how ' twould lessen the smart) 
From the active young widow, 
The spruce little widow— 
The prim little widow who keeps the Cock Inn. 
There's Bet at the " Blossoms," and Poll of the 
" 
Crown," 
Pat Dolly, who owns the " Red Hart ;" 
There's Kate of the " Garter and Star" of renown, 
And Peggy, who keeps the " Skylark ;:' 
Spruce Fan of the " Eagle," and Nan of the " Bell," 
Pretty Jane of the " Man dress'd in Green"— 
But of all the fair creatures who others excel, 
Give me the widow— 
The sweet, pretty widow who keeps the Cock Inn. 
There's Nance at " The Old Woman clothed in 
Grey," 
I 
look black upon her, I 
vow; 
Even Letty, who graces " The Old Load of Hay," 
I 
don't care a 
straw for her now. 
There's another decanter'd just now in my heart, 
I 
for none of the rest care a 
pin ; 
Oh! that Cupid, the rogue. would but let fly his 
dart 
At the plump little widow, 
The gay little widow= 
The spirited widow who keeps the Cock Inn. 
When last in her little bar parlor I 
sat, 
I 
joked her about her lone state; 
A 
brood of young chickens, dear widow, mind that, 
Would be better around you to prate. 
'r-
111r7S471", 
V47,•.% 
Says she, " Pray, don't reckon them ' fore they are 
hatched'— 
Says I, 
Where's the harm, or the sin ? 
You can 
manage a second—we're 
very well 
matched— 
You dear little widow, 
You charming young widow— 
You're a 
nice little widow to keep the Cock Inn." 
Then, here's to the dear little charmer I 
prize, 
In a 
bumper now filled to the brim, 
For who could resist such a 
pair of black eyes, 
As in rich liquid moisture they swim. 
Away ! then, away with my bachelor's vow ! 
My hand, then, is her's, with the ring, 
For if she be willing to take me in tow, 
I'll marry the widow— 
I'll marry the widow, and—keep the Cock Inn! 
FRIEND, BY MY SOWL, I'LL WHISKY DRINK. 
Am—Come, dwell with me. 
Friend, by my sowl, I'll whisky- drink, 
'Tis better far than beer ; 
'Tis not so heavy I 
do think, 
But ahl '
tis far more dear; 
Like to fair woman's blush 
That steals away the heart, 
It quickly drowns your brains in lush, 
With senses does depart. 
Come, take a 
drop with me, my blade, 
We'll get drunk and loon ; 
And when we on the floor are laid, 
We'll snore away till noon ; 
Perhaps you think it is not paid, 
But that I 
chalk a 
score; 
Of that, my boy, he not afraid, 
But drink, and call for more.

THE FRISKY IRISH SONGSTER . 
THE STARS AND THE STRIPES. 
BY JOHN F. 
POOLE. 
As sung by Fred May. Ala—Darling Cul(' Stick. 
I've got a 
new song for to sing ye's to night, 
It's intended to put the Blue Devils to flight ; 
That it's got a 
fine chorus to you will be shown, 
And the inan that wont sing it can let it alone. 
It's of the blackguards our country that's ruinin'; 
The traitors all houlding coinmunion ; 
A 
trying to bust lip the Union, 
And pull down the Stars and the Stripes. 
When the rebils first hoisted their flag of seven Stars, 
With the bould Sixty-ninth I 
wint off to the wars ; 
Tho' the foes they were thick and our numbers but few, 
We made a 
charge on a 
masked battery or twO. 
Though we'd bate five to one on a 
livel, 
With a 
foe that would only act civil; 
I 
tell you we fought like the divil, 
Uphoulding the Stars and the Stripes. 
Then the bold Fire Zouaves—'twas delightful to see 
How they cut up the famous Black Horse cavalry ; 
And the foe got a 
taste, too, of mild Blinker Hill, 
For the brave Massachusetts boys fought with a 
will. 
They wint in with a 
whoop and a 
shout, sirs ! 
For the Union ! it was their cry out, sirs! 
Oh! the rebels found they were about, sirs, 
Uphoulding the Stars and the Stripes. 
Then at Port Royal, too, was the divil to pay, 
When they found Uncle Sam had his fleet on the say, 
And was coming to bate them, like rats in a 
pit, 
And to show them no matey, bad luck to the bit. 
For while they were trembling with fear, 
Their flag it came down round their ears, 
Up went, with three hearty good, cheers, 
The beautiful Stars and the Stripes. 
THE FRISKY IRISH SONGSTER . 
15 
We'll soon bate the blackguards, afloat and ashore, 
And our flag on Port Sumter be waving once more; 
Now they'd betther give in, for we'll gain the day, 
And Corcoran, too, we'll have back in the fray. 
-Whin the Star-Spangled banner he raises; 
Sure, he'll capture ould Jefferson Davis; 
And we'll bate all the rebels, like blazes, 
Or we'll die for the Stars and the Stripes! 
GOING HOME WITH THE MILK IN THE 
MORNING. 
Sung by Mr. CONLEY, at the Star Concerts. 
Grieving a 
folly, 
I 
hate melancholy, 
For mirth is the best thing on earth I 
can find ; 
Let them say what they will, 
Still my goblet 1'11 fill, 
And water as drink still be scorning. 
The headache and pains I 
all do defy; 
It's better, believe me, to laugh than to cry— 
Step out on the spree, 
That's the motto for me, 
And come home with the milk in the morning. 
Now, some people say, 
From the glass keep away: 
They are not to be thought of, the ignorant elves; 
I 
like to go out, 
And wander about, 
And stop with my friend till the dawning ; 
Sometimes I 
get more than my head can well bear. 
When some friend I 
meet, my enjoyment to share. 
I 
don't care a 
pin 
For the rows I 
get in, 
But reel home with the milk in the morning. 
Tide-oll-te-tol-lol. 
16 
THE FRISKY IRISH SONGSTER . 
Brown's an excellent fellow, 
And likes to get mellow, 
Stops out on the spree, never heeding the end; 
Although he is single, 
With us he can't mingle, 
For his landlady's given him warning: 
Mr. Brown, Mr. Brown I 
this conduct won't do, 
Here, night after night, I've to sit up for you— 
You shan't have the key, 
I 
assure you, from me, 
To come home with the milk in the morning. 
Tide-oll-te-tol-lol. 
To see the sun rising 
Is a 
sight most surprising, 
As it's topping with gold every red chimney pot, 
Like the hue on the cheek 
Of the maidens we seek, 
And the light of your eyes on it dawning ; 
To see the small sparrows, in quiet paths met, 
Hopping hither and thither, their breakfasts to get, 
It's a 
beautiful sight, 
Which our eyes must delight, 
Coming home with the milk in the morning. 
Tide-oll-te-tol-lol. 
There's little fat Briggs; 
He's been running his rigs, 
And has many skirmishes with the police ; 
And of-ten his eyes 
You, sure, would surmise, 
A 
circle of black were adorning. 
At last, Johnny Briggs got a 
week at the mill, 
Which proved to poor John such a 
nice little pill, 
He swore, ne'er again 
After twelve out remain, 
To come home with the milk in the morning. 
THE FRISKY IRISII SONGSTER. 
17 
But I 
hope you don't think 
That I'm given to drink, 
For that, on my part, a 
folly would be ; 
So, mind my example, 
And on it don't trample, 
But take from my moral a 
warning: 
There's no harm in taking a 
glass with a 
friend; 
But shun dissipation, or look to the end, 
For ' twould be sad to tell, 
That a

HOPPY HOOLAHAN'S LAMENT ON THE DEATH 
OF HIS DUCK. 
A celebrated old Irish lamentation song—sung by FRED M AY, 
with thunders of applause. 
Am—Jeff Davis. 
I 
once had a 
duck when I 
lived in Dramuck, 
I 
was quite out of luck when I 
lived in that land, 
Until some wicked thief, that was longing for beef, 
For to get some relief, he invented a 
plan. 
At the head of my bed, where my Swaddy was fed, 
By the hokey, says Ned, they broke open a 
hole ; 
Oh! one morning in May, jest at brake of day, 
I 
went to see had she laid, but my duck she was stole. 
With my right tooral laddy, my darling big Swaddy, 
Oh! right tooral laddy, Killcock and Coleraine. 
CHORUS—
With my right tooral laddy, &c. 
Her praises I'll sing, through Autumn and Spring, 
For England's own Queen, while she sits on the throne : 
Och ! I'll sing in her praise, while there's grass on the 
• 
braes, 
For to give my heart aise, while I'm sighing alone.

TR 
THE FEISKY IRISH SONGSTER. 
Through the streets, as I 
walk, I'm crying quack,quack ! 
Her affections from me they never could stray. 
May the curse of Kishogue light down on the rogue, 
May sweet bad luck attend him, the murthering thief. 
With my right tooral laddy, my darling big Swaddy, 
Oh! right tooral laddy, Killcock and Coleraine. 
My darling big Swaddy was raised in Glenaddy, 
From the sweet County Cavan her grandmother came; 
Her grandfather drake came from Ballymackfake, 
And there is no mistake she is of the best game.. 
Her eggs they were blue, most enchanting to view, 
Some days she lays two—I'm elated with grief. 
May the curses of nine all together combine, 
May the divil admire him, the plundering thief. 
With my right tooral laddy, my darling big Swaddy, 
Oh! right tooral laddy, Killcock and Colleraine. 
To curse him again I 
cannot refrain; 
Shure, you'll all say amen when I 
finish my prayer. 
May the bee and the asp, the bear and the wasp, 
Be his daily companions at markets and fairs— 
May the weasel and rat build their nest in his hat, 
And ten thousand lough leeches upon him be stuck— 
May everything fright him, and mad dogs to bite him, 
The monster that smothered my beautiful duck. 
With my right tooral laddy, my darling big Swaddy, 
Oh ! right tooral laddy, Killcock and Coleraine. 
My duck gave me bother, neither one way nor t' other, 
She always come home at the close of the day ; 
In lake, stream, or brook, I 
ne'er had to look, 
Or a perch from my cabin I 
ne'er had to stray ; 
While the ducks of the town they could never be found, 
For each maid, wife, and clown was out on the search. 
In the year ' twenty-nine, as ye's all bear in mind, 
She had twelve dozen laid on the tenth day of March. 
With my right tooral laddy, my darling big Swaddy, 
Oh! right tooral kiddy, Killcock and Coleraine.

My duck is good blood, tho' she waddles through mud, 
She's as white as a 
crud, when her wings she does shake, 
She's gray on the back, and she's green round the neck, 
And she's double related to Flaherty's drake. 
Every night, for my loss, on my pillow I 
toss, 
Over Flaherty's grave every evening I 
stray ; 
Through the streets as I 
walk, shure, I'm crying quack, 
quack! 
Shure, my heart is clean broke, since my duck's stole 
away. 
With my right tooral laddy, my darling big Swaddy, 
Oh! right tooral laddy, Killeock and Coleraine.

THE MAN IN THE MOON. 
A Favorite Comic Song. 
Ant—Things I 
don't like to See. 
When a 
bumper is ordered, ' tis vexing, no doubt, 
To find, when you'd fill, that the wine is all out ; 
And, surely, it's an equally unpleasant thing, 
To be asked for a 
song, when you've nothing to sing. 
I 
might try something old, if an old one would do, 
But the world is still craving to have something new; 
And what to select for the words or the tune, 
I, in fact, know no more than the man in the moon. 
As the man in the moon a 
new light on me throws, 
He's a 
man we all talk of, but nobody knows ; 
And though a 
high subject I'm getting in tune, 
I'll just have a 
turn at the man in the moon. 
And though a 
high &c. 
The man in the moon seems to lead a 
queer life, 
With no one about him, not even a 
wife ; 
No friends to console him, no children to kiss, 
No ohance of his joining a 
meeting like this. 
His changing his lodgings each quarter's unpleasant, 
Living first in a 
circle, and then in a 
crescent; 
If he rents by the quarter so fast going by, 
I 
should fancy he's rented uncommonly high. 
But he's used to high life, for all circle's agree 
None are moving in such a 
high circle as he; 
For though nobles go up in a 
royal balloon, 
They can't get introduced to the man in the moon. 
For though nobles &c.

'Tis thought that all madmen are moonstruck we find, 
And the man in the moon may be out of his mind; 
But it can't be for love, for ' tis very well known 
There's no girls there to meet him by moonlight alone. 
It can't be ambition, for rivals he's none— 
At least he's only eclipsed by the sun— 
Though his prospects are often o'erclouded, he sees ; 
But the man in the moon can make light of all these. 
In drinking I 
fear he may sometimes surpass, 
For he always looks best when he's seen through a 
glass. 
Then, for smoking, though he may smoke morning and 
noon, 
We can't blow a 
cloud like the man in the moon. 
Then, for smoking, &c. 
He's a 
mighty sad rake, he don't rise till ' tis dark, 
When the night it sets in, he sets out for a 
lark ; 
He goes roaming about, and sings out to the spheres, 
"We wont go home tilt morning and daylight appears." 
He looks in at the stars that go shooting up there, 
And lets loose the dog- star to bait the great bear; 
At the milky way stops for a 
minute or two, 
Has some milk, but don't pay, cause it's swill and sky-
blue. 
But daylight soon takes the shine out of him, quite, 
And ha goes home and gets into bed by sunlight, 
And though you may think him a 
regular spoon, 
You'd be plagued to get over the man in the moon. 
And though you may &c. 
PADDY'S GRAVE. 
A Parody on the death of Nelson. 
RECITATIVE. 
O'er Paddy's grave the boys and girls all pressed,

But all their sighing and bitter woes, 
Were turned from mourning into kicks and blows.

'Twas at the Pig and Cat, where Judy met her Pat, 
With his big nose so red ; 
Says she, " you've proved untrue, and faith I'll wallop 
you''— 
With that, she broke his head. 
Her brother, too, was standing by, who nately blacked 
her father's eye, 
For he was bould and frisky, for he was bould and 
frisky. 
Cnonus.—And trough the bogs this was the cry,. 
" 
Ireland expects you'll not be shy, 
But fight for love and whisky, 
But fight for love and whisky." 
The whisky now went round, while hundreds decked 
the ground 
With many a 
broken crown; 
And Judy, danger mocking, a 
stone put in her stocking, 
To knock the divils down. 
She hit Jim Connor o'er the sconce, floored dirty Dick 
and Joe, at once, 
And killed poor Connor Aisky, and killed poor Connor 
Aisky. 
Yet trough the bogs this was the cry, 
" 
Ireland expects you'll not be shy, 
But fight for love and whisky, 
But fight for love and whisky." 
At last, a 
dreadful row commenced—I'll tell you how— 
And Paddy's nose it bled; 
It was a 
dreadful shock, and Paddy felt the knock, 
And then he hung his head; 
" 
Oh! dear !" says he, " I'm kilt, I 
fear ; see how my 
nose is bleeding here, 
But still, my boys, I'm frisky ; but still, my boys, I'm 
frisky." 
He died, dead drunk upon the field, 
Crying, " Ireland expects you'll never yield, 
But fight for love and whisky, 
But fight for love and whisky."

DON'T YOU THINK SHE DID ? 
AIR—Trab, trab, trab. 
One day, I 
went out walking 
With such a 
nice young girl; 
She smiled, as we were talking, 
And shook each glossy curl. 
She'd patent boots upon her feet; 
Her gloves were made of kid; 
She asked me if I'd stand a 
treat— 
I 
said I 
would, and did. 
CHORUS— She asked me if I'd stand a

A 
ride she much desired; 
So, then, ' twixt me and you, 
A

And went up to Bellevue. 
The driver was a 
civil man, 
And looked where he was bid ; 
She said she quite enjoyed herself, 
And I 
really think she did. 
Cuottus—She said she quite enjoyed herself, &c 
We both sat down together, 
And had a 
jolly lunch, 
And then I 
asked her, whether 
She'd like a 
glass of punch ; 
She only answered with a 
wink, 
And closed one little lid : 
The punch come in—I 
begged she'd drink, 
And, to tell the truth, she did.

Glass after glass soon followed— 
I 
thought she'd ne'er be done; 
So quickly each was swallowed, 
I 
counted twenty-one.

But she said that she belonged to me,

I

A crack on the sconce, and the loss of a

Now, merry be Christmas, success to good neighbors, 
Here's a

High held up the glass, while he vented this prayer:

May whisky, by sea, or by land, in all weather, 
Be never denied to the children of care."

THE HUNGRY ARMY . 
Written and sung by Mr. J. KEARNEY, at all the Concert Halls in 
Dublin. 
The wind in thundering gales did blow, 
As I 
left home, in black October ; 
The hail and rain in torrents came, 
And the world I 
thought was surely over. 
The reason was, my colleen dhas 
And I 
fell out about cousin Barney, 
So I 
bid farewell to the town of Kells, 
And come up to Dublin to join the army. 
In Dublin City I 
soon arrived, 
And crossed the Liffey, that lovely river ; 
At the Castle yard, a 
big blackguard 
Asked me to enlist, the blacks to skiver;

, 
I 
did agree, then they gave me 
A 
gun, but the weight of it soon did warm me, 
So I 
hired myself, by the powers of delph, 
To go and smash China, along with the army. 
&c. 
One morning the captain bawled out, MAncn! 
In the barracks at Chatham we'll be quartered. 
By jabers ! you see you'll not quarter me, 
For I 
didn't join you to be slaughtered ; 
A. sergeant they said I 
should be made, 
But I 
knew the captain was tipping me blarney; 
The stripes I 
got on an awkward spot--
While my back was aching, I 
cursed the army. 
Ri-tal, &e. 
News from abroad soon made us look sharp ; 
In a 
hurry we packed our kits together. 
To keep up our hearts we'd a 
stock of the sup, 
And to keep up each head we'd a 
stock of leather; 
We marched to sea, playing Patrick's Day, 
The cries of the colleen's would most alarm you, 
Some thought in their mind of the girls behind, 
But I 
thought on the boys before our army. 
Ri-tal, &c. 
In a 
ship as big as a 
town we sailed, 
In every hole and corner stuffing us ; 
To keep out the cowld we got down in the howld, 
By the tarnal it wouldn't hould half enough of us. 
We were smothered to death for want of breath, 
And bursting with hunger,which did not charm me, 
We were order 'd to land, and make a 
brave stand, 
Oh! they might easy say stand to a 
hungry army. 
Ri-tal, &c. 
On the field of battle I 
hadn't been long, 
Till I 
was longing for it to be over; 
To let a 
ball pass, I 
lay down on the grass, 
But I 
didn't imagine myself in clover. 
THE FRISKY IRISH SONGSTER.

That ball, I 
can tell, was a 
great bombshell, 
It struck my rear, but didn't much harm me ; 
When to the next charge we were ordered to march, 
I'd a 
lame excuse to halt from the army. 
Ri-tal, &c. 
Unfit for the service, I 
got my discharge, 
Then go it, ye cripples, says uncle Toby, 
A 
pension I'll get. if not I'll be let 
,To go out to Killmainham and be a 
fogy. 
If I 
live a 
full score of years or more, 
With a 
fogy's haul each day to warm me, 
I'll remember the way I 
got gunpowder tea, 
When I 
went to smash China, along with the army.

The tear fell gently from her eye, 
When last we parted from the shore ; 
My bosom heaved with many a 
sigh, 
To think I 
ne'er should see her more, 
To think I 
ne'er should see her more. 
Dear youth, she cried, and canst thou haste away ? 
My heart will break—a 
little moment stay. 
Alas ! I 
cannot, cannot part from thee. 
The anchor's weigh'd, the anchor's weigh'd— 
Farewell ! farewell ! remember me.

trembling said ; 
rlonbt not a

ne'er shall meet another maid. 
Whose charms can fix this heart, like thine, 
Whose charms can fix this heart, like thine. 
Go, then, she cried, but let thy constant mind 
Oft think on her thou leav'st, in tears, behind. 
Dear maid, this last embrace my pledge will be :

Thin Biddy and I 
wint together to mass, 
And may-be she didn't outshine every lass; 
Oh! she looked so divine, and she prayed so devout, 
That, faith, I 
scarce knew what myself was about,

And love with myself being busy the while,

The first thing I 
saw, when I 
came to the door, 
A man they call'd Simon, he stood on the floor; 
He raised a 
drawn sword right over my head— 
For fear of my life, I 
was sorely in dread. 
Sing lilly-fal-la-da-dal-lal. 
The next thing I 
saw, it was a

He wore a

Sure, had I 
been home, I'd ne'er been a

saw, it was a

The hair on his chin hung down on his throat : 
Says I

I 
turned myself round, and made for the door. 
Sing lilly-fal-la-da-dal-lal. 
The buck was brought in, and I 
was put on; - 
The moment I 
mounted, they bid him begone; 
'Twas through a

THE GUAGER'S SLIP. 
Written and sung by Mn. JOHN KEARNEY, at the Dublin Concerts. 
Ant—Emerald Isle. 
I 
was born, one day, in a 
place called Green Erin, 
Where potatoes and whisky is plenty, they say ; 
The boys are good humored, the girls they are frisky— 
'Twas the seventeenth of March, and St. Patrick's Day. 
But as I 
grew ould, I 
grew fond of my country, 
I 
owed no gay fellow no envy nor spleen ; 
I 
whistled and jostled, I 
fought and I 
wrestled 
On the fields of ould Erin, because they were green. 
My nights and my days I 
spent merry and frisky, 
'Till I 
fell in love with one Biddy Malone ; 
Her parents distilled and sold good potteen whisky, 
For under the ground they made fine Innishowen ; 
And Biddy, I 
thought, was a 
venus for beauty 
I'd challenge against either a 
duchess or queen, 
But her own cousin-german, a 
north country carman, 
Came up, and he swore there'd be wigs on the green. 
When the spalpeen he found that Miss Biddy preferred 
me, 
He took up his wad ; to the gauger he went— 
Says he, now your worship I 
hope you'll reward me, 
To turn informer I 
am fully bent. 
There's my own Biddy Malone has got a 
husband, 
A 
lump of an ignorant, Dublin jackeen; 
Now, this very night, we'll both give them a 
fright, 
For we'll spill all the whisky about on the green. 
THE FRISKY IRISH SONGSTER. 
But I 
was wide-awake, for still and apparatus 
I 
yoked to the horses, for five miles away, 
Expecting the guager that night would come at us ; 
If not, 
was sure he would come the next day. 
I 
thin dug a 
hole at the door of the still- house, 
Just big enough to hold twelve or thirteen ; 
I 
filled it with muck, and upon it I 
stuck 
Some big sods of grass for to make it look green. 
Next morning, at daylight, we went to the trap, 
To see if we had e'er a 
gull in our clutch: 
There we found them both, after dropping in slap, 
And, in truth, didn't pity them much; 
The carman and gauger had sunk to the bottom, 
A 
bit of their carcasses couldn't be seen; 
Some were huzzaing, while others were praying— 
The same end to the foes of our island so green. 
Now, a 
bit of advice I 
would give all that's courting— 
It may be of service to every young man— 
Don't be misled by a 
colleen that's sporting, 
For fear that you should have recourse to a 
plan. 
Never be sure of the girl you're in love with, 
A 
spalpeen may drop in quite awkward between ; 
There's many a 
slip twixt the cup and the lip, 
Like the slip the poor gauger he got on the green. 
PETTICOAT LANE. 
Sung by FRED M AY. 
Ain—Rafferty's Boar. 
When to Dublin I 
came, from the sweet County Down, 
I 
called on a 
friend for to show me the town ; 
He brought me thro' streets, lanes and alleys so grand, 
"Till my brogues were most wore, and I 
scarcely could 
stand; 
show'd me fine houses, were built up so high, 
And a 
man made of stone almost up to the sky : 
But the names of them places went out of my brain, 
Except one, and he said it was Petticoat Lane. 
) 
THE FRISKY IRISH SONGSTER. 
35 
Convenient to Petticoat Lane, there's a 
place, 
And as we walked through it, we couldn't get peace; 
The shops were all full of fine clothes, black and blue, 
But the fellows outside nearly tore me in ,two; 
One dragged me this way, to get a 
good frieze, 
Another had corduroy breeches, my size; 
But one chap bawls out, when I 
wouldn't remain, 
Show him up to the college in Petticoat Lane. 
RI-to-ral-la-la, &c. 
We got loose from this spot, myself and my friend ; 
I 
couldn't do less than a 
teaster to spend ; 
But we spied boys and girls, in a 
laughable group, 
Sitting cross-legged, and they licking up soup. 
Says I, are these what you call your poor-house recruits? 
Ax the divil, says one, and his bowl at me shoots ; 
They roared with pleasure, while I 
roared with pain, 
Arrah, Paddy, you're welcome to Petticoat Lane. 
Ri-to-ral-la-la, ke. 
My friend thought to drag me away by the sleeve; 
When a 
tartar dropt over my bead an old sieve ; 
I 
turned for to strike her, but got in the eye 
A 
plaster of what they called hot mutton pie. 
I 
kept groping about, like a 
man that was blind, 
Till I 
caught hould of somebody:coining behind ; 
I 
prayed that I 
might get the strength of a 
Cain, 
To be able to whale him in Petticoat Lane. 
Ri-to-ral-la-la, &c. 
I 
walloped away, and I 
got walloped too, 
While all sorts of ructions were raised by the crew ; 
You would swear it was raining brick- bats and stones, 
Till I 
heard my antagonist giving some groans : 
Run and be damn'd to you, some one did cry— 
Sure, I 
can't, for the mutton that's stuck in my eye. 
I 
was led through the crowd, and heard somebody sayin 
There's a 
peeler most kill'd up in Petticoat Lane. 
&c. 
36 
THE FRISKY IRISH SONGSTER. 
These words, like a 
thunderbolt, fell on my ear, 
So I 
scooped all the fat from my eye, pretty clear ; 
My friend tould the crowd that was round to be mute, 
While we slipped to a 
house called the sign of the boot. 
There I 
call'd for a 
sup, and we both took a 
seat— 
Two or three that had backed us came in for a 
treat— 
When the reckoning was called for, my pockets were 
clean, 
For pounds, shillings, and pence were in Petticoat Lane. 
Ri-to-ral-la-la, & c. 
-The reck'ning it came to a 
hog and a 
groat, . 
For which the landlord he took the lend of my coat ; 
I 
started without, still cursing the town, 
When a 
policeman's pot-stick made friends with my 
crown : 
Says he, you lave killed C, 106 ;— 
Arrah, be aisy, sir, I 
want none of your tricks ; 
But the sergeant and twenty more swore it was plain 
That I 
was the bully of Petticoat Lane. 
Ri-to-ral-la-la, &c. 
They all swarmed about me, like flies on a 
cask, 
But to prison to take me was no easy task. 
When I 
got there, I 
was charged with the crime : 
'Twas my own brother Darby I 
bate all the time. 
Whin he seen me he let out a 
thundering curse 
On the day that he first went to join in the force ; 
He released my ould coat, and he got me off clean, 
To go home and say prayers for sweet Petticoat Lane. 
Ri-to-ral-la-la, &c. 
USEFUL KNOWLEDGE. 
A CELEBRATED COMIC SONG. 
I'm Simon Bore, just come from college, 
My studies I've pursued so far, 
I'm called, for my surprising knowledge, 
The walking Cyclopedia. 
THE FRISKY IRISH SONGSTER. 
Tho' some, perhaps, may call me quiz, 
Their jeers I 
value not a 
jot; 
In art and nature all that is 
I'll tell you—aye, and all that's not. 
CHORUS—These are sober truths, I 
vow, 
Pay attention to me now, 
And in the end you must allow 
That this is useful knowledge. 
Hay is brought to town in carts, 
Buckwheat cakes aint made of tin, 
They don't feed cows on apple tarts, 
Nor wear gilt spurs upon the chin, ; 
Bullocks don't wear beaver hats, 
Fiddles are not made of cheese, 
Nor pigeon pies of water rats— 
Lawyers always take their fees. 
These are sober truths, I 
vow, &c. 
Putty is not good to eat, 
There's no effect without a 
cause, 
Dust will never wet your feet, 
And spiders never break the laws ; 
Girls don't dance in hunting boots, 
The deaf and dumb are always mute, 
Houses are not made of hoops, 
And pigs don't play the German flute. 
These are sober truths, I 
vow, &c. 
Twenty turnips make a 
score, 
Children creep before they walk, 
A 
cow's tail never grows before, 
And Congressmen know how to talk ; 
A 
comic song is not a 
hymn, 
The French are mostly born in France, 
Fishes aint afraid to swim, 
Turkeys seldom learn to dance. 
These are sober truths, I 
vow, &c.

Johnny Bull once used his fist, 
Then John, he tried it,o'cr again, 
But the lion's tail, it got a

So, Johnny, don't try it again.

Cotton don't grow on a

We don't sup tea up with a

Jeff Davis aint an honest man, 
We don't make cabbage out of hay, 
Nor Turkey carpets out of bran.

-AN IRISHMAN'S EXCUSE FOR A FIGHT; OR, 
THREAD ON THE TAIL OF MY COAT. 
Ant—If you Travel the Wide World All Over. 
I 
learned my reading and writing 
At Bally Raggit, where I 
wint to school ; 
'Twas there that I 
first took to fighting, 
Wid the schoolmaster, Mr. O'Toole; 
He and I 
had many a 
scrimage, 
But the divil a 
copy I 
wrote ; 
But there wasn't a 
gorsoon in the village 
Dar thread on the tail of my coat. 
CHORUS—Sing whack! fal de dal. 
I 
was an litigant hand, too, at courting, 
For lessons I 
took in the art, 
Till cupid, the blackguard, while sporting, 
An arrow druv cane tro my heart.

Judy Connor, I 
lived straight forninst her, 
And tinder lines to her I 
wrote ; 
And who dar say a 
bad word against her, 
Whoo! I'd jump on the tail of his coat. 
Sing whack! fol de dol. 
A 
bog trotter, one Mickey Maloney, 
lie thought for to coax her away; 
He had money, and I 
hadn't any; 
So a 
challenge I 
sent him next day; 
Next morning we met at Killhaley, 
The Shannon we crossed in a 
boat; 
Who°! I 
lathered him with my shillelah, 
For he trod on the tail of my coat. 
Sing whack! fol de dol. 
My fame spread about through all nations, 
Folks flocked for to gaze upon me; 
And they cried out without hesitation., 
" 
Your a 
fighting man, Mickey Magee !" 
Sure I 
fought with the Finnegan faction, 
I 
bate all the Murphy's afloat ; 
If you're in for a 
row or a 
ruction, 
Just tread on the tail of my coat. 
Sing whack! fol de dol. 
ENCORE VERSES. 
Then straight I 
wint to Miss Connor, 
And with loving kisses, so sweet ; 
The next day the priest tied the knot, 
Faix you couldn't untie with your teeth ; 
Five pounds he axed for his fee, sir, 
Or a 
pig, horse, or sow, or a 
goat; 
But I 
flung him cane out of the window, 
For he stepped on the tail of my coat. 
Sing whack! fol de dol. . 
I've traveled through Ulster and Munster, 
Killkenny and Connaught likewise; 
'Twas there that I

youngster, 
Sure I

THE GREAT, BIG, UGLY IRISHMAN. 
Ant—Green Grows the Rushes, 0! 
There was a 
lady lived in Leith, 
A 
lady very stylish, man, 
And yet, in spite of all her teeth, 
She fell in love with an Irishman— 
A 
nasty, ugly Irishman, 
A 
wild, tremendous Irishman, 
A 
tearing, swearing, thumping, lumping, 
Ramping, roaring Irishman. 
His face was no ways beautiful, 
For with small-pox ' twas scarred across, 
And the shoulders of the ugly dog 
Were almost quite a 
yard across. 
Oh! the lump of an Irishman, 
The whiskey-drinking Irishman— 
The great he-rogue, with his wonderful brogue, 
The fighting, rioting Irishman. 
One of his eyes was bottle-green, 
And the other eye was out, my dear, 
And t
ehe calves of his wicked-looking legs 
Were more than two feet round, my dear. 
Oh ! the great, big Irishman, 
The rattling, battling Irishman, 
The stamping, ramping, swaggering, staggering 
Lathering swash of an Irishman. 
• 
THE FRISKY IRISH SONGSTER. 
He took so much of Lundy foot, 
That he used to snort and snuffle, 0, 
And in shape and size, the fellow's neck 
Was as big as the neck of a 
buffalo. 
Oh ! the horrible Irishman, 
The thundering, blundering Irishman, 
The slashing, dashing, smashing, lashing, 
Thrashing, flashing Irishman. 
41 
His name was a 
terrible name, indeed, 
Being Thimoty Thady Mulligan; 
And whenever he'd empty his tumbler of punch, 
He'd not rest till he'd fill'd it full again. 
The boozing, bruising Irishman, 
Th' intoxicated Irishman, 
The whisky, frisky, rummy, grummy, 
Bandy, dandy Irishman. 
This was the lad the lady loved, 
Like all the girls of quality, 
And he broke the skulls of the men of Leith, 
Just by the way of jollity. 
Oh ! the slathering Irishman, 
Oh! the barbarous Irishman; 
The hearts of the maids and the gentlemen's heads 
Were bothered by this Irishman.

My heart's like a 
beet- root choked up with chicken-
My head's like a 
pumpkin and running all to seed. 
I've a 
great mind to make myself a

And finish all my woes on the branch of a 
tree ; 
But I 
won't for I

And honor my death with a

THE PIRATE CREW. 
O'er the wide world of waters we roam ever free, 
Sea kings and rovers, bold pirates are we ; 
We own no dominion—what matter, we sail, 
Light-hearted and true, in the loud- roaring gale ; 
We love the black storm, as we ride o'er the billows, 
The strong timbers creak, the masts bend like willows, 
But fearless in danger, we brave the mad foam, 
Ever free on the deep, the wild ocean our home. 
Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah! merry the life of a 
bold pirate 
crew, 
Dauntless and daring the deeds that we do— 
Hurrah! the black banner is nailed to the mast, 
Death to the foe, as it waves in the blast.

Crowd sail, a 
strange vessel is heaving in sight, 
Shouts the pirate aloft, she is ours to-night ; 
How we dash through the foam, bearing down on the 
prize— 
No quarter we give to the stranger that flies. 
Clear the decks, ever brave are the pirates in battle, 
Our sabres flash brightly, the loud cannons rattle : 
Now we board her in triumph, and bear her away— 
Three cheers for the prize, as we bound o'er the spray. 
Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah! merry the life of a 
bold pirate

Dauntless and daring the deeds that we do— 
Hurrah! the black banner is nailed to the mast,

A TIGHT IRISH HEART FOR THE LADIES. 
Sung by Mr. J. 
COLLINS, in the Old Broadway Theatre. 
One day, madam nature was busy, 
Bright Venus beside her was seated, 
She looked till her head got quite dizzy— 
She lunged till the job was completed. 
Sure, I'm making a 
heart, sez the goddess, 
For love and its joys all betrayed is ; 
It's neither a 
stays, nor a 
bodice, 
But an Irishman's heart for the ladies. 
Singing to-ral la-loo-ral 
To-ral la-loo-ral la- lido, 
To-ml la-loo-ral la-loo-ral, 
And a 
tight Irish heart for the ladies. 
She bound it all round with good nature, 
'Twas tender and soft, like the dove, sir ; 
'Twas sprinkled with drops of the creature, 
And stuffed up with large lumps of love, sir. 
'Twas pure as the streams of the Shannon, 
And warm as a 
roasted potato, 
Red hot, like a 
ball from a 
cannon, 
Is an Irishman's heart for the ladies.

SPRIG OF SHILLELAH. 
Oh I 
love is the sowl of a 
nate Irishman, 
He loves all that's lovely, loves all that he can,, 
With his sprig of shillelah and shamrock so green. 
His heart is good-humored, ' tis honest and sound, 
No envy, nor malice, is there to be found ; 
He courts and he marries, he drinks and he fights, 
For love, all for love, for in that he delights, 
With his sprig of shillelah and shamrock so green. 
Had you ever the luck to see Donnybrook fair, 
An Irishman, all in his glory, is there, 
With his sprig of shillelah and shamrock so green. 
His clothes spick and span new, without e'er a 
speck, 
A 
neat barcelona tied round his neat neck ; 
He goes into a 
tent, and he spends half a 
crown, 
He meets with a 
friend and, for love, knocks him down, 
With his sprig of shillelah and shamrock so green. 
As evening returning, and homeward he goes, 
His heart soft with whisky, his head soft with blows, 
From a 
sprig of shillelah and shamrock so green. 
He meets with his sheelah, who, blushing a 
smile, 
Cries, get you gone, Pat, yet consents all the while : 
To the priest they then go, and nine months after that, 
A 
fine baby cries out, how do you do, father Pat, 
With your sprig of shillelah and shamrock so green.

Bless the land, then, says I, that gave Patrick his birth; 
Bless the land of the oak, and it's neighboring earth, 
Where grows the shillelah and shamrock so green. 
May the sons of the Hudson, the Tweed, and the Shan-
non, 
Thrash the foe who dare plant on our confines a 
cannon; 
United and happy, ' neath liberty's shrine, 
May the leak and the thistle long flourish and twine 
Round the sprig of shillelah and shamrock so green. 
SOLDIER'S DREAM. 
Our bugles sang tt uce, for the night cloud had lower'd, 
And the sentinel stars set their watch in the sky, 
And thousands had sunk on the ground, overpowered, 
The weary to sleep, and the wounded to die. 
When reposing, that night, on my pallet of straw, 
By the wolf- scaring faggot that guarded the slain, 
At the dead of the night a 
sweet vision I 
saw, 
And thrice, ere the morning, I 
dream'd it again. 
Me thought, from the battle field's dreadful array 
Far had I 
roam'd, on a 
desolate track— 
Twas autumn, and sunshine arose on my track 
To the home of my father, that welcom'd me back. 
I 
flew to the pleasant fields, traveled so oft 
In life's morning march, when my bosom was young, 
I 
heard my own mountain goats bleating aloft, 
And knew the sweet strain that the corn reapers sung. 
Then pledged we the wine cup, and fondly I 
swore, 
From my home and my weeping friends never to part ; 
My little one's kissed me a 
thousand times o'er, 
And my wife sobbed aloud, in the fulness of heart, 
Stay, stay with us—rest, thou art weary and worn 
And fain was the war-broken soldier to stay ;— 
But sorrow returned with the dawning of morn, 
And the voice of my dreaming ear melted away.

NELL FLAUGHERTY'S DRAKE. 
AN OUT AND OUT IRISH SONG. 
My name it is Nell, right candid I 
tell, 
And I 
live at Coot hill, I 
never will deny; 
I 
had a 
large drake, the truth for to spake, 
My grandfather left me, when going to die. 
He was merry and sound, and would weigh twenty 
pound— 
The universe round would I 
rove for his sake,--
Bad luck to the robber, be he drunken or sober, 
That murdered Nell Flaugherty's beautiful drake. 
His back it was green, and rare to be seen ; 
He was fit for a 
queen of the highest degree ; 
His body, so white, it would you delight ; 
He was fat, plump, and heavy, and brisk as a 
bee. 
This dear little fellow, his legs they were yellow, 
He could fly like a 
swallow, and swim like a 
hake ; 
But some wicked savage,to grease his white cabbage, 
Has murdered Nell Flaugherty's beautiful drake. 
May his pig never grunt, may his cat never hunt— 
That a 
ghost may him haunt in the dark of the night, 
May his hens never lay, may his horse never neigh, 
May his goat fly away, like an old paper kite ; 
May his duck never quack, may his goose be turned 
black ' 
And pull down his stack with her long yellow beak ; 
May the scurvy and itch never part from the britch 
Of the wretch that murdered Nell Flaugherty's drake. 
May his rooster ne'er crow, may his bellows not blow, 
Nor potatoes to grow— may he never have none— 
May his cradle not rock, may his chest have no lock, 
May his wife have no frock, for to shade her back-
bone ; 
That the bugs and the fleas may this wicked wretch 
tease, 
And a 
piercing north breeze make him tremble or 
shake ; 
THE FRISKY IRISH SONGSTER. 
May a 
four year's old bug build a 
nest in the lug 
Of the monster that murdered Nell Flaughterty's 
drake. 
May his pipe never smoke, may his teapot be broke, 
And—add to the joke—may his kettle not boil; 
May he be poorly fed till the hour he is dead, 
May he always be fed on lobscouse and fish oil; 
May he swell with the gout, till his grinders fall out, 
May be roar, howl, and shout, with a 
horrid tooth-
ache; 
My his temple wear horns, and his toes, corns, 
The wretch that murdered Nell Flaugherty's drake. 
May his dog yelp and howl with both hunger and 
cowld, 
May his wife always scold, till his brains go astray; 
May the curse of each hag that ever carried a 
bag 
Light down on the war, 
till his head it turns gray ; 
May monkeys still bite him, and mad dogs affright 
him, 
And every one slight him, asleep or awake; 
May wasps ever gnaw him, and jackdaws still claw 
him, 
The monster that murdered Nell Flaugherty's drake. 
But the only good news I 
have to diffuse 
is of Peter Hughes and Paddy McCade, 
And crooked Ned Manson, and big nose Bob Hanson, 
Each one had a 
grandson of my beautiful drake. 
Oh ! my bird he has dozens of nephews and cousins, 
And one I 
must have, or my heart it will break— 
To keep my mind easy, or else I'll run crazy, 
And so ends the song of my beautiful drake.

'Tis there you'll see Ireland, so famous, 
That was built before Adam was breech'd, 
Who lived in the reign of King Shamus, 
Ere he was at the Boyne overreached. 
CHORUS—With my whack! fal-de-dal fal-de-ral-la. 
Oh ! the land of shillelah for me. 
There you'll see my ancestors glorious, 
The sons of the brave O's and Macs; 
Who died whene'er they were victorious, 
And after that ne'er turned their backs. 
Our heads are stout and full of valor, 
Our hearts are wise and full of brains; 
In love we ne'er blush and change color, 
And the ladies reward all our pains. 
With my whack, Sw. 
St. Patrick is still our protector, 
He made us an island of saints; 
Drove out snakes and toads like a 
Hector, 
And ne'er shut his ears to complaints. 
Come, all you that would wish to be frisky, 
And never to die in your beds, 
Come to Ireland and tipple the whisky, 
And drink ten years after your dead. 
With my whack, Sze. 
THE MULETEER. 
Sung by M R. ALBERT B RAHAM, at the Broadway Music Hall. 
I 
am a 
simple muleteer, not too particular to rules, 
I 
treat the world, both far and near, as roughly as I 
treat my mules; 
If they attempt to give me laws, 
To give, to give me laws, 
Kick up a 
prance without good cause, 
Without, without good cause.

But, should they call, I

No, no, I'm ne'er afraid.

SUMMER HILL COURTSHIP.

On Summer Hill I

I'll tell you of a

Caused me to part, 
With my sweetheart, 
I'm telling of it now, sir. 
Indeed I

Last night I

With true love I

Whilst me she hooks, 
To a

And axed me for to treat her— 
To pies and tarts. 
At this I 
look'd quite funny, 
Says I, my darling honey, 
I've lots of love, 
As you can prove, 
But, faith, I've got no money. 
Indeed I 
hav'n't.

Oh, says she, you're not the thing, sir, 
I've got you on a 
string, sir, 
Get rid of hope, 
And buy a 
rope, 
Go, give yourself a 
swing, sir. 
That's what's the matter. 
A 
tear from my eye started, 
I 
sighed, quite broken hearted; 
I 
sighed a 
sigh, 
She blacked my eye, 
And that's the way we parted. 
If we didn't, damme. 
All men who would be doing, 
Afraid of mischief brewing,

With lots of cash, 
Whene'er you go a

There you may slip in to take a 
dip in, 
Fornint the shippin', that at anchor ride, 
Or in a 
wherry cross the ferry, 
To Carrigaloe on the other side. 
Mud cabins swarm in this place so charming, 
With sailors' garments hung out to dry ; 
And each abode is snug and commodious, 
With pigs melodious in their straw built sty. 
'Tis there the turf is, and lots of murphys, 
Dead sprats and herrings, and oyster shells ; 
Nor any lack, oh! of good tobacco, 
Though what is smuggled by far excels. 
There are ships from Cadiz, and from Barbadoes, 
But the leading trade is in whisky punch ; 
And you may go in where one Moll Bowen 
Keeps a 
nate hotel for quiet lunch. 
But land or deck on, you may safely reckon, 
Whatsoever country you come hither from, 
On an invitation to a

Of ships, there's one fixed for loading convicts, 
A 
floating stone jug of amazing bulk; 
The hake and salmon playing backgammon, 
Swim for divarsion all round the hulk. 
There saxon jailors keep brave repealers, 
Who soon with sailors must anchor weigh; 
From the Emerald Island ne'er to see dry land, 
Until they spy land in sweet Botany Bay.

By Irishmen planted, it flourished and grew,

Too-ra-laddee, &c. 
The shillelah's an Irishman's joy and delight, 
His companion by day, his protection by night; 
And though rough in appearance, you all must allow, 
That it's mighty engaging when seen in a 
row. 
Too-ra-laddee, &c.

Sung by E.

Oh ! don't you remember, Lilly dear, 
The mill by the old brook side, 
Where we used to go, in summer time, 
And view the rippling tide, 
THE FRISKY IRISII soxosTER. 
53 
And the miller, with his slouched hat, 
And his eyes of mildest grey, 
Plodding along at his dusty work, 
And singing, the live- long day— 
Eu-la-ra cu-la-ra eu-la-ra-e, 
Singing the miller's song, 
Eu-la-ra eu-la-ra eu-la-ra-e, 
Singing the miller's song. 
Ah! Lilly. the mill's now torn away, 
And a 
factory, dark and drear, 
Rears its smoke o'er the chimney-top, 
And dims the atmosphere. 
The only time for pleasure now 
Is the Sabbath, all day long, 
And what brings back the olden time 
Is the good old miller's song— 
Eu-la-ra eu-la-ra eu-la-ra-e, &c. 
Ah ! Lilly. the miller's now dead and gone— 
In the old churchyard he's laid, 
And the poor old dog that used to bark, 
As round the mill we played, 
He followed in the funeral train, 
As the villagers round did throng ; 
He died upon his master's grave, 
As they sang the miller's song— 
Eu-la-ra eu-la-ra eu-la-ra-e, &c. 
THE BELLS OF SHANDON. 
A BEAUTIFUL IRISH BALLAD. 
Sung by M R. DAN COLLINS. 
With deep affection and recollection, 
I 
often think of those Shandon bells; 
Whose sound, so wild, would in the days of childhood, 
Fling round my cradle their magic spells. 
On this I 
ponder where'er I 
wander, 
And thus grow fonder, sweet Cork, of thee ; 
With thy bells of Shandon, that sound so grand, on 
The pleasant waters of the river Lee. 
THE FRISKY IRISII SONGSTER. 
I've heard bells chiming full many a 
clime in, 
Tolling sublime in cathedral shrine ; 
While at a 
glibe rate brass tongues would vibrate, 
But all their music spoke naught like thine. 
For mem'ry dwelling on each proud swelling 
Of thy belfry knell, its bold notes free ; 
Made the bells of Shandon sound far more grand on 
The pleasant waters of the river Lee. 
I've heard bells tolling old Adrian's mole, in 
Their thunder rolling from the Vatican; 
And cymbals glorious swinging uproarious, • 
In the gorgeous turrets of Notre Dame. 
But thy sounds were sweeter than the dome of Peter 
Flings o'er the Tiber, pealing solemnly. 
Oh! the bells of Shandon sound far more grand on 
The pleasant waters of the river Lee. 
There's a 
bell in Moscow, while on tower and Kiosk 0, 
In Saint Sophia the turkman gets. 
And loud in air, calls men to prayer, 
From the tapering summit of tall Minarets. 
Such empty phantom I 
freely grant them ; 
But there's an anthem more dear to me : 
'Tis the bells of Shandon, that sound so grand on 
The pleasant waters of the river Lee. 
ROBINSON CRUSOE, 
When I 
was a 
lad, 
I 
had cause to be sad; 
My grandfather I 
did lose, oh I 
I'll bet you a 
Can, 
You've heard tell of the man, 
His name was Robinson Crusoe, 
Cuonus—Oh! poor Robinson Crusoe, 
how could you come for to go do so ? 
Tink a 
tink tang, tink a 
tink tang, 
Oh! poor Robinson Crusoe. 
THE FRISKY IRISH SONGSTER. 
Perhaps you've read in a 
book, 
Of a 
voyage he took, 
And how the raging winds blew so; 
That the ship, with a 
shock, 
Drove plump upon a 
rock, 
Near drowning poor Robinson Crusoe. 
Oh! poor Robinson Crusoe, &c. 
Poor soul, none but he, 
Remained on the sea— 
Oh! fate, how could you go do so— 
'Till ashore he was thrown, 
On an island unknown. 
Oh! poor Robinson Crusoe. 
Oh! poor Robinson Crusoe, &c. 
He wanted something to eat, 
And he sought for some meat, 
But the cattle away from him flew, so 
That, but for his gun, 
He'd been surely undone; 
Hard lines for Robinson Crusoe. 
Oh! poor Robinson Crusoe, &c. 
But he saved from aboard 
An old gun and a 
sword, 
And another odd matter or two, so 
That, by dint of his thrift, 
He managed to shift. 
Well done, says Robinson Crusoe. 
Oh! poor Robinson Crusoe, &c. 
And he happened to save, 
From the merciless wave, 
A poor parrot--I 
assure you ' tis true—so 
That when he'd come home, 
From a 
wearisome roam, 
She'd cry out, poor Robinson Crusoe. 
Oh! poor Robinson Crusoe, &c. 
THE FRISKY IRISII SONGSTER. 
He got all the wood 
That ever he could, 
And stuck it together with glue, so 
That he made him a 
hut, 
In which he might put 
The carcass of Robinson Crusoe. 
Oh! poor Robinson Crusoe, &c. 
He used to wear an old cap, 
And a 
coat with long nap, 
With a 
beard as long as a 
jew, so 
That by all that's civil, 
He looked like the divil. 
More than like Robinson Crusoe. 
Oh! poor Robinson Crusoe, &c. 
Then his man Friday 
Kept his hut nice and tidy— 
To be sure ' twas his business to do so; 
They lived friendly together, 
Less like servant than brother, 
Did Friday and Robinson Crusoe. 
Oh! poor Robinson Crusoe, &c. 
At last an English sail 
Came near within hail ; 
Oh! then he took to his little canoe, so, 
When on reaching the ship, 
The captain gave him a 
trip, 
Back to the country of Robinson Crusoe. 
Oh! poor Robinson Crusoe, &c.

Finds plenty, in abundance, 
And every furrow of the plough, 
A 
step to independence.

DOLLY DUNN OF DONNYBROOK.

I 
lent, do you see, some time ago, 
To my uncle, all my Sunday clothes, 
And the raison I

Nobody but my uncle knows. 
But soon I

Determined in some cozy nook 
To booze a 
bit, and have a 
smack 
With Dolly Dunn of Donnybrook. 
CHORUS—Tide-fol-de-did -el -ol. 
Now, Dolly was as nate a

As ever carried milk in pail ;

And something lively in her tail ; 
Her prayer- book, when she went to mass, 
She carried like a 
reaping- hook, 
And who could judge a 
whisky-glass 
Like Dolly Dunn of Donnybrook. 
THE FRISKY IRISH SONGSTER. 
As over Dodder s

See how it gapes—look, Billy, look— 
And I 
see something else, says I 
To Dolly Dunn of Donnybrook. 
Tide-fol-de-did-el-ol. 
And when we got beneath a 
tree, 
Says I, my blooming mossy rose, 
Admiring of your form so rare 
Will shortly bring things to a 
close. 
Don't lay a 
finger there, says she, 
But there's my hand, and kiss the book, 
And never turn your back on me, 
Says Dolly Dunn of Donnybrook. 
Tide-fol-de-did-el-ol. 
Thin into a 
tint we wint, 
Where we had the spre.e 
of sprees; 
The marriage money there we spent, 
And done the clargy of his fees. 
And whin she got a 
stitch in her wig, 
She roared at every swig she took, 
Here's glory to our Irish jig, 
Says Dolly Dunn of Donnybrook. 
Tide-fol-de-did-el-ol. 
Thin to the play-house next we wint, 
Where Dolly's grin would never fail 
To see when Harlequin was dead, 
Just like a 
man strung up in jail. 
But, worst of all, one Billy Potts 
Came grinning out like any rook, 
And roared a 
jackeen song in Scotts, 
About Dolly Dunn of Donnybrook.

Oh! Larry McHale, he has little to fear, 
He never could want if the crop didn't fail,

And the heart for to spend it had Larry McHale.

Oh ! it's little he cared for the Judge or Recorder, 
His house was as big and as strong as a 
jail; 
With a 
cruel four-pounder he kept all in order, 
He'd murther the parish, would Larry McHale. 
He'd a 
blunderbuss too, of horse pistols a 
pair, 
But his favorite weapon was always a 
flail; 
raix, you'd laugh for to see how he'd empty a 
fair, 
He handled it nately, did Larry McHale. 
His ancestors were kings before Moses was born, 
His mother descended from great Grannaile, 
He laughed all the Blakes and the Frenchs to scorn, 
They were mushrooms, compared to ould Larry 
McHale. 
Every day he sat down to a 
beautiful dinner, 
With uncles and cousins enough for a 
tale, 
And though loaded with debt, still the divil a 
thinner 
Could law or the Sheriff make Larry McHale. 
With his larder supplied, and his cellar well stored, 
None lived half so well from Fair Head to Kinsale, 
As he piously said, I've a 
plentiful board, 
And the Lord he is good to ould Larry McHale. 
So fill up your glasses, and a 
high bumper give him, 
Faith, ' tis little we'd care for the tithes or repale, 
For ould Ireland would be a 
fine country to live in, 
If the people were all like ould Larry McHale.

THE WEDDING OF BALLYPOREEN. 
.Descend, ye chaste Nine, to a 
true Irish bard, 
You're old maid's, to be sure, but he sends you his card, 
To beg you'll assist a 
poor musical elf, 
With a 
song ready made—he'll compose it himself: 
About maids, boys, priest and a 
wedding, 
With a 
crowd you could scarce thrust your head in, 
A 
supper, good cheer, and a 
beddin', 
Which happened at Ballyporeen. 
'Twas a 
fine summer's morning, about twelve in the 
day, 
All the birds fell to sing, all the asses to bray, 
When Patrick, the bridegroom, and Onagh, the bride, 
In their best bibs and tuckers, sat out side by side. 
Oh ! the piper played first in the rear, sirs, 
The maids blushed, and the brides-men did sneer, sirs : 
Mavrone ! how the spalpeens did stare, sirs, 
At this wedding at Ballyporeen. 
They were soon tacked together, and home did return, 
To make merry the day at the sign of the churn; 
When they sat down together, a 
frolicsome troop, 
Oh! the banks of the Shannon ne'er saw such a 
group: 
There were turf-cutters, thrashers and tailors, 
With harpers, and pipers, and nailers, 
And pedlers, and smugglers, and sailors, 
Assembled at Ballyporeen. 
There was Brian MacDermot, and Shaughnessy's brat, 
With Terrence and Driscoll, and platter- faced Pat; 
There was North McCormick and Brian O'Lynn, 
And the fat, red hair'd cook- maid, that lives at the Inn. 
There was Sheelah and Larry the genius, 
With Pat's uncle, Darby Dennis, 
slack Thady and crooked McGennis, 
Assembled at Ballyporeen.

Now the bridegroom sat down'to make an oration, 
And he charm'd all their souls wid his kind botheration,

cursed, 
They might ate and be * 0  0  aye, and drink till they 
burst.

have, if I 
thrive, sirs, 
I 
hope here again you'll all drive, sirs; 
You'll be welcome all dead or alive, sirs, 
To a

Then the bride got up to make a 
low bow, 
But she twitted and felt so, she couldn't tell how : 
She blushed and she stammered—the few words she let 
fall 
She whispered so low that she bothered them all. 
But her mother cried, what ! are you dead, child? 
Oh ! for shame of you, hold up your head, child„ 
Though I'm sixty I 
wish I 
was wed, child, 
Oh! I'd rattle at Ballyporeen. 
Now they sat down to meat, Father Murphy said grace, 
Smokin' hot were the dishes, and eager each face; 
The knives and forks rattled, spoons and platters did 
play, 
And they elbowed, jostled and walloped away; 
Rumps, chines and fat surloins did groan, sirs, 
Whole mountains of beef were cut down, sirs, 
They demolished all to the bone, sirs, 
At this wedding at Ballyporeen. 
There was bacon and greens—but the turkey was 
spoiled— 
Potatoes dressed both ways, both roasted and boiled, 
Hogs, puddings, red herrins—the -priest got the snipe— 
Calcannon, pies, dumplings, cods, cowheels and tripe. 
Then they eat till they could eat no more, sirs, 
And the whisky came pouring galore, sirs— 
Oh! how Terry McMannus did roar, sirs--
Oh ! he bothered all Ballyporeen. 
THE FRISKY IRISH SONGSTER. 
65 
Now the whiskey went round, and the songsters did 
roar : 
Tim sung " Paddy Riley", Nell sung " Molly Ashtore", 
Till a 
motion was made that their song they'd forsake, 
'And each lad take his sweetheart his trotters to shake ; 
Then the pipes and couples advancing, 
Pumps, brogues and bare feet fell prancing, 
Such piping, such fig'ring, such dancing, 
Was ne'er known in Ballyporeen. 
Now Patrick, the bridegroom, and Onagh, the bride, 
Let the harp of ould Ireland be sounded wid pride, 
And to all the brave guests, young or old, gray or green, 
Drunk or sober, they jigg'd it at Ballyporeen. 
And when Cupid shall lend you his wherry, 
r1'0 tip o'er the conjugal ferry, 
I 
wish you may be quite as merry, 
As we were at Ballyporeen. 
HANDY ANDY. 
Am—Billy Barlow. 
How are yez, my friends? sure I 
hope you're all well, 
My cruel misfortunes to you I 
will tell ; 
I 
was born on Friday, that ill-omened day, 
" 
He's a 
blunderin' blackguard," my father did say. 
CHORUS : 
Och hone! now ain't it a 
shame 
To be called Handy Andy, when Andrew's my 
name ? 
My blunder, the first, I 
remember it yet, 
I 
was sent to the Post Office, letters to get, 
"What name ?" axed the clerk, as I 
looked at him shy. 
" 
That's none o' yer business, ye blackguard," says I, 
Och hone! etc.

THE FRISKY IRISII SONGSTER. 
One morning there lay about two feet o' snow, 
Says my boss, " You must clear off the pavement, ye 
know," 
lie meant but the snow, but I 
cleaned it complete, 
By shoveling the bricks wid the snow in the street. 
Och hone! &c. 
One night I 
was waiter at a 
party so nice, 
They tould me to put the champaigne in the ice, 
I 
opened each bottle, and thought it all right, 
In the ice-water poured it and ruined it quite. 
Och hone! &c. 
Says they, " Ye young stupid see what you have done, 
You've spoiled our champaigne, likewise all our fun, 
Go bring in soda water. " Says I, " enough said," 
Soap and water I 
brought, which they threw at my 
head. 
Och hone! &c. 
Next I 
hired with a 
farmer to work by the year, 
One day he says, " Give the cows corn in the ear!' 
With shelled corn I 
filled up the ears of the cows, 
When the farmer he kicked me straight out o' the 
house. 
Och hone! &c. 
One day a 
man led his horse up to a 
fence, 
"Keep an eye on him." says he, " I'll give ye six 
pence," 
But he never paid me, ' cause the horse took a 
fright, 
Though my eye was on him ' till he run out of sight. 
Och hone! &c. 
Then a 
footman I 
was, to attend to the door, 
Where I 
had to tell lies as I 
did ne'er before; 
" 
Is your masther at home ?' one wud ax, wid a 
grin, 
"No, he told me to tell yez he wasn't jest in." 
Och hone! &c. 
THE FRISKY IRISH SONGSTER. 
67 
At last, then, I 
sez to myself : Andy, dear, 
If ye wudn't be spiled ye had better leave here. 
Now I 
work at railroading and digging canawl, 
And when grog time comes round, I'm there at roll-
call. 
Och hone! &c. 
• 
PAT AND THE PRIEST. 
Am—Villikens and His Dinah. 
Pat fell sick on a 
time, and he sent for the Priest, 
That, dying, he might have his blessing, at least, 
And to come with all speed did humbly implore him, 
To fit him out right for the journey before him. 
CHORUS—Sing tu-ral li-tu-ral li-tu-ral li-day. 
The good Father the summons did quickly obey, 
And found Paddy, alas! in a 
terrible way ; 
Fix'd and wild were his looks, and his nose cold and 
blue, 
And his countenance wore a 
cold churchyard-like hue. 
Sing tu-ral li-tu-ral, &c. 
The good Father bid Pat to confess all his crimes, 
To think of his sins, and forsake them betimes; 
Or his fate else would be, like other vile souls, 
TO 
be flayed and be salted, then roasted on coals! 
Sing tu-ral li-tu-ral, &c. 
Oh! think, my dear Pat, on that beautiful place, 
Where you'll visit St_ Patrick, and see his sweet face ; 
"Pis a 
country, my jewel, so charming and sweet, 
Where you'll never want praties nor brgues to your 
feet. • 
Sing tu-ral li-tu-ral, &c. 
68 
ME FRISKY 1RISII SONGSTER. 
Well, well thin, says Pat, with inquisitive face, 
That country must, sure, be a 
beautiful place— 
St. Patrick, no doubt, will give us good cheer, 
But d'ye think has he got any ould whisky there ? 
Sing tu-ral li-tu-ral, &c. 
The good Father, with wonder, amaze, and arprise, 
Clasped his hands, and next turned up the whites of his 
eyes: 
Oh ! vile sinner, says he, can you hope to be forgiven, 
If you think there is carousing and drinking in Heaven. 
Sing tu-ral li-tu-ral, &c. 
Well, well thin, say Pat, though I 
cannot help think-
ing, 
If in Heaven they can do without eating or drinking, 
(Though I 
don't mean to say what you tell is a 
Fable), 
'Twould be dacent, you know, to see a 
drop on the 
table. 
Sing tu-ral li-tu-ral, &c. 
WHAT AN ILLEGANT LIFE A FRIAR LEADS. 
Ant—St. Patrick was a 
Gentleman. 
What an illegant life a 
friar leads, 
With his fat, round paunch before him, 
He mutters a 
prayer, and counts his beads, 
And all the women adore him. 
It's little he's troubled to work or think, 
Wherever devotion leads him, 
A " pater" pays for his dinner and drink, 
For the church—good luck to her—feeds him. 
From the cow in the field to the pig in the stye, 
From the maid to the lady in satin, 
They tremble whenever he turns an eye, 
He can talk to the devil in Latin. 
THE FRISKY 1RISII SONGSTER. 
69 
He's mighty sevare to the ugly and ould, 
And curses like mad, when he's near ' em ; 
But one beautiful trait of him I've been tould, 
The innocent craytures don't fear him. 
It's little for spirits or ghosts he cares, 
For ' tis true, as the world supposes, 
With an " Ave" he'd make them march down 
stairs, 
Av they dared to show their noses. 
The devil himself's afraid, ' tis said, 
And dares not to deride him ; 
For angels make each night his bed, 
And then—lie down beside him. 
PADDY GOSHLOW. • 
By G. W. ANDERSON. AIR—Billy Barlow. 
My darling, don't smile, while to you I 
do tell . 
The very sad fate that to me has befell : 
I 
was crossing the street, to come here, ah ! oh! 
And slap into the gutter went Paddy Goshlow. 
With me hi ho, Paddy Goshlow, 
Slap into the gutter went Paddy Goshlow. 
I've a 
note which the President sent me, so fine ; 
He axed me quite dacent to go wid him and dine ; 
He said that the company ne'er could agree, 
Without the pleasure of my company. 
With me hi ho, Paddy Goshlow, &c. 
I 
arrived at the house, and I 
looked mighty glum; 
The President said, " Why, we thought you'd ne'er 
come." 
Says I, " Me clothes are all torn, and that yez all 
know, 
And a 
bashful ould fellowis Paddy Goshlow." 
With me hi ho, Paddy Goshlow, &c.

I 
was next introduced to the company fair, 
Whin a 
lady stood by me, with such sweet auburn 
hair, 
She seized hold of my hand, and shook it just so, 
Let go, you ould divil," cried Paddy Goshlow. 
With me hi ho, Paddy Goshlow, &c. 
I 
left the company all in despair; 
The women went crazy, and tore all their hair, 
They fell on their knees, and cried out oh! oh! 
Don't leave the dear company, Paddy Goshlow." 
With me hi ho, Paddy Goshlow, Scc. 
I 
was on my way home, on a 
moonlighted night, 
Far away in the distance I 
saw a 
beautiful sight : 
A 
crowd of young spalpeens had collected, just so, 
To take a 
good peep at Paddy Goshlow. 
With me hi ho, Paddy Goshlow, &c, 
I 
arrived at the house, and so as to be sure, 
sat on a 
tub, just close by the dure ; 
I 
got asleep on the edge, and it's in I 
fell, oh! 
And here's the drowned remains of poor Paddy

BARREL OF PORK. 
Two Israelite Brothers in New York once dwelt, 
And in all kinds of merchandise freely they dealt ; 
They were thought to be wealthy, between me and you, 
And each brother was really as rich as a 
Jew. 
Tol rol, &c. 
No creditor e'er went away from their door, 
'Till death called on Moses to settle his score ; 
No mortal can ever evade such a 
call: 
So, Moses he sleeps, sirs, his last sleet) of all.

TIIE FRISKY IRISH SONGSTER. 
Then Isaac, his brother, exclaimed : Lucky elf! 
All his goots and his moneys belong to myself— 
Ah! but stop, dere's his will, I 
must just read it thro', 
To see what poor Moses would have me to do. 
The will it thus run : When I 
shall cease to live, 
All my cash and my goots to my brother I 
give, 
Upon this condition: that hard he shall toil 
To bury my body in real English soil. 
Isaac tried every captain and could not prevail; 
For none would agree with the body to sail ; 
But not to be baulk'd, he set quickly to work, 
And embarked it, at last, as a 
barrel of pork. 
Mo was cut to pieces with chopper and knife, 
He had never been cut up so much in his life. 
Isaac wrote to his agent to tell him his plan, 
And begg'd him to bury the poor pickled man. 
Some months after this, as he walked on the wharf,. 
He met with the captain, a 
sallow-faced dwarf: 
Yell, good captain, he cried, looking steadfastly round, 
You delivered my barrel, I 
hope, safe and sound ? • 
Said the captain: Friend Isaac, I 
am sorry to say 
That, during our trip, we were near cast away, 
When, in sight of old England, we lay a 
sheer hulk, 
And provisions being scarce, we were forced to break 
dulk. 
Break .dulk! roar'd out Isaac, you're worse than a 
Thrk! 
But surely you ne'er broke my barrel of pork ? 
Indeed but we did, cried the captain, don't huff! 
For, I'll pay you a 
good price, though it was devilisk 
tough! 
Ah! mine Got! cried poor Isaac, as I 
am a 
sinner, 
You have eat my poor proder Moses for dinner. 
Your brother? why, zounds ! 
then myself and the 
crew 
Have feasted three days on a 
piece of tough Jew! 
" 
72 
THE FRISKY IRISH SONGSTER. 
But, come now, friend Isaac, to finish this work, 
I'll pay for your brother as though he was pork. 
No, no, replied Isaac, though we cheat one another, 
Our law won't permit us to sell our own brother. 
In his purse the Captain was putting his gold! 
When Isaac espying, cried: Goot Captain hold! 
Though I 
can't touch de cash, for dat proder of mine, 
You can pay me, you know, for the parrel and prine. 
SHEELAH O'NEAL. 
When first I 
began for to sigh and to woo her, 
Of many fine things I 
did say a 
great deal; 
But, above all the rest, that which pleased her the best 
Was—Och, will you marry me, Sheelah O'Neal ? 
My point I 
soon carried, 
For straight we were married, 
Then the weight of my burden I 
soon ' gan to feel , 
For she scolded, she fisted, 
Oh! then I 
enlisted, 
Left Ireland and whisky, and Sheelah O'Neal. 
Then, tired and dull-hearted, 0, then I 
deserted 
I 
fled into regions far distant from home— 
To Frederick's army, where none e'er could harm me, 
Save Sheelah herself in the shape of a 
bomb. 
I 
fought every battle 
Where cannons did rattle, 
Felt sharp shot, alas! and the sharp- pointed steel ; 
But, in all my wars round, 
Thank my stars! I 
ne'er found 
Aught so sharp as the tongue of cursed Sheelah O'Neal.
