T:  So you say Pepper was one of the (--)
A:  Yeah, Willie Pepper was one of the idols in our days.  You know, Willie [unclear] because he 
used to be so fast.  You know, jab, jab, he'd set you up, move in and out.  [phone rings]  Then you
had Sandy Sadlier, and then down the road you had Cassius Clay with the jab.  Remember he 
used to box everybody?  (T:  Yeah, yeah)  Then people, I think people started figuring that jab 
sets a lot of punches up and uh, rather than (--)  The more you slug with a guy, that means you're 
in close, the more you can get hit yourself.  You know, you box, you build points up.  (T:  
Umhm)  The whole thing started changing I think.  People start you know, combination fights 
and stuff.  
T:  Umhm.  Did Ali, did Clay really affect boxing around here?  Did he change anything?
A:  Oh I think Clay kept boxing alive.  You know, the way he used to talk.  You know, he's 
always knocking somebody you know, and you know, comical and everything else.  But he could
fight.  You know that kept people(--)  A lot of people, just to go down to see him, well they'd uh, 
just to see him get beat, because they were sick of listening to his mouth.  And other people, you 
know, they enjoyed watching him fight, you know?  (T:  Right)  He kept it alive.  
T:  What about his foot work?  Was that really knew when it came around, moving like he did?
A:  Yeah.  Well Willie Pepper like I say, had pretty good footwork, but like I say, you go back 
thirty years ago, a lot of these guys would just be walking bangers.  You know, you look at all 
your old fighters now at sixty, they're all scars and pug noses, cauliflower ears.  Look at guys like
Ray Leonard and them now, they don't even look like they got a mark on them, because they 
fight a little more with their head.  You know, they think a little bit, you know?  
T:  Uh huh.
A:  Like I say, the purpose of the game is to hit and not get hit.  You keep getting hit in every 
fight, you're not going to be around too long, you know?  
T:  There was a, is it Al Mello that's still, he's still alive, right?
A:  Yeah.  Al Mello is one of the greatest fighters that ever come out of Lowell.  Yeah.  Actually 
he fought two world champions and licked them out for titles.  He fought the Dundee and, I think
it was both Dundee brothers he licked, you know, in his days.  Uh, I know he was in the 
Olympics I think in 1928 was it?
T:  Yeah, '24 I think, in Paris.  Yeah.  
A:  But uh, he was a dog.  They say you could hit him all day, just walk through you and bang, 
you know.  And they, I guess they brought [few words unclear] to Gorilla Jones, or somebody, 
who just hit him in the arms the whole fight.  And that kind of was his down fall, you know.  I 
guess they never recuperated.  You know, muscles, hands couldn't stay up anymore.  He was a 
[unclear], but they say he was tough.  (T:  Uh huh)  Everybody that I talked, all the old timers, 
said he was the greatest thing that every come out of the city.
T:  Is that right?  (A:  Yup)  And his name is really something else. 
A:  His name is Tavares.  I know Al Mello pretty good.  (T:   Uh huh)  When my dad had a 
restaurant for years, Al used to own a bar right across the street.  And his sons, as a matter of 
fact, one of his sons is Head of Community Development here for the city.  Well one of the big 
positions in there, you know?  Jack Tavares.  But uh, was a nice guy.  Like I say, easy.  A matter 
of fact, I seen him about two years ago, he still looks in tremendous condition.  He does a lot of 
walking and everything else, you know?  (T:  Is that right?)  Yeah.
T:  Why did he fight under a different name?  
A:  Well years ago in them days a lot of people fought in different names, because the mothers 
didn't want them fighting.  They were, 90% of your old timers if you look, they all had alias, you 
know?  
T:  Uh huh.  So they'd actually train all that time and their mothers would never know what 
they're up to?  
A:  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know if that was the case with Al Mello himself, or you figured people 
recognized the name more than Tavares or something, you know?  (T:  Yeah)  Be remembered a 
lot more.  I'm not sure.  But I know years ago a lot of them used alias, you know?  As a matter of 
fact there were, some of the old time fighters used three or four different names, you know?  
Maybe they get a loosing record, or winning record.  And then if the guy heard the name they 
wouldn't fight.  So then they'd fight on another name to get a bout someplace, you know?  
T:  I see.  I see.  Do people do that now?  
A:  Not to my knowledge, I don't think they do it.
T:  Yeah, it would be harder to do now.  Okay, well I'll let you go.  I know you got things to do.  
We could do this for (--)
A:  Hey, I enjoyed talking to you.
T:  Yeah, I enjoyed listening to it.
A:  That's good.  You know you think back, it's good to go over some of the memories and things
way back.  You forget you know?  
T:  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's interesting [unclear] stuff.  Well uh, I would like to go back to the gym 
sometime.
A:  You just let me know, and uh (--)
T:  Is there somebody that could let me in?
A:  I could get you down today if you want to go down to take them pictures today.  
T:  Okay, that would be good.
A:  You know, if you, while nobody's there bouncing.  (T:  yeah)  Just let me know what time and
I'll make sure we get somebody.
T:  Um, let's see.  Let me see what time it is.  Now I have to go pick up my stuff, but uh (--)
