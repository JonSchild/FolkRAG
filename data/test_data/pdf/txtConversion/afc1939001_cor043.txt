[Letter from Harold Spivacke to John A. Lomax, General
Delivery, Huntsville , TX and Merryville, LA]
May 19, 1939
Mr. John A. Lomax General Delivery
Dear Mr. Lomax:
I am writing to both Huntsville and Merryville in the hopes that this letter will reach you
soon. Your package of records came, but the express company refused to deliver it for
less than five hundred dollars. It seems that you wrote the C.O.D. and the valuation closely
and did not punctuate it to the satisfaction of the express company. In spite of all our
protestations that the contents were government property and belonged to us, they really
refused to deliver it to us unless we paid the five hundred dollars. The records will be
held here for awhile until this matter is settled, but will you please communicate with the
express company immediately and explain to them the error of their ways.
With best regards,
Sincerely yours, Harold Spivacke Chief, Division of Music
HS mr
