WILL H. TRIMBLE. 
The subject of our sketch was born in the Crescent City (New 
Orleans, La.,) July 19th, 1854, of highly respectable parents, 
where he attended school, receiving a 
fair education. 
At the 
age of fifteen he was sent to work to learn the trade of machin -
t, 
ist, but having no liking for the above, he deserted a calling 
that had been distasteful to him. 
Ho next turned his attention 
to the show business, and made his first appearance on any 
stage in his native city at a 
small variety hall, as a 
jig dancer, 
in 1873, under the assumed name of Billy Williams. 
Having 
some little talent, and encouraged by the management and his 
many friends, he devoted his time entirely to the stage, and 
made his second appearance at the Globe Theatre, ( under the 
management of J. J. Kittredge. 
In the company were the 
Worrel Sisters, Pendy, Ernest Byne and others,) performing his 
Statue Clog Dance. 
After playing for two seasons in his native 
city, he went to Mobile, Ala., playing ten weeks' engagement; 
introducing for he first time his Mystic Changes and Pedestal 
Clog Dance, u 
ith great success 
Next went to Florida for two 
weeks, and then returned to New Orleans, playing an engage-
ment at Bidwell's Academy of Music, with tremendous success. 
The New Orleans Times speaking of his performance, says, 
" 
The dramatic portion of the entertainment terminated with the 
songs and dances of Mr. Trimble, a 
very clever actor, whose 
sudden transitions from gruff manhood to shrinking femininity 
filled the audience with merriment. 
After playing in New Or-
leans for quite a 
while, he next went to the Adelphi Theatre, 
Galveston, Texas, thence to Austin, Texas. 
The press of the 
latter city, commenting on his performance, says, " Mr. Trimble 
is a 
young man of fine promise, and in the five or six different 
characters he represents, of the serio-comic cast, is deservedly 
popular." 
He has performed in all the principal cities South, meeting 
with great success, and has travelled with the Reed and Mc-
Laughlin Minstrels and the Netton Bric-a-Brac Combination, as 
the principal feature. 
At the beginning of his theatrical career 
he showed the most unmistakable evidence for the highest suc-
cess in his profession, and is fast gaining the topmost round of 
the ladder to fame. 
He is strictly temperate and attentive to 
business, has made many friends both on and off the stage, and 
you will always find him with a 
helping hand and a 
welcome to 
all.

(Looks R.) 
Lord

(Enter Susie through gate with armful of wood.

UNCLE JASPER.—Don't ax me, chile ; don't ax me. 
SUSIE.—Dar am sumfm' wrong; come, daddie, tell me, and 
if dar am anything I

UNCLE JASPER.— Chile, T 
hates to tell you. 
But I 
will tell 
you, Susie. 
Yesterday, when all de hands was coining from 
working in de fields and bringing in de cotton, one oh de baskets 
was missed, and one ob de hands told massa ' twas I 
dat stole 
it. 
Susie, my chile, I 
was born and raised on dis plantation, 
and I 
never as much as stole a 
pin from any one. 
But I 
have 
missed a 
great many things, but I 
never once made a 
complaint 
to him (pause.) 
Massa came to Inc last night and told me dat 
I 
must leave de place, and he abused me and called me hard 
names. 
But I 
never spoke back to hm, for massa has always 
been good and kind to me. 
Ile never in his life spoke cros-, to 
me before. 
I 
have always been a true and faithful slave to 
massa, and I 
am willing to go down on my old hands and Inees 
and work for him. 
And let me tell you one thing, Susie; never 
take nuffin' but what belongs to you, ' cause 'taint right. ' Case 
if you do, you will be called away some day to heaven to ac-
count for what you have done in dis wicked world. 
Remem-
ber your poor old mudder and fader when dey am gone, and be 
a 
good girl. 
Always be good and kind to every one, and every 
one will be kind to you. 
(
Kisses her.) 
Dat arn what has trub-
bled your old fader. 
10 
SVSIE.—Daddie, I 
don't believe dat you would steal, 'cause 
you're so good and kind to every one. 
Dere must be somebody 
on de plantation dat does not like you, and has stolen de basket 
and blamed you for it, and has made massa abuse you, and turn 
you away from do place. 
(Pause.) I must go now, daddie. 
You know dat Dooley- promised to take me to de camp-meeting 
to- night. 
(
Exit into cottage.) 
.TASPER.—Good-bye, chile. God bless your little heart, honey. 
(Weeps.) 
My heart am sot on dat chile, and if massa was to 
drive me away it would kill me. 
(Looking off.) 
Yonder comes 
massa now, up de walk. 
He don't seem to be angry. 
(Enkr 
Harry through gate.) 
HARRY. — Jasper, I 
came to ask your forgiveness for treating 
you the way I (lid, awhile ago. and I 
hope you will pardon me 
for being so rash. 
JASPER.—Forgive you, massa. 
Yes, massa, I 
freely forgive 
you, as I 
hope to be forgiven myself, some day. 
HARRv.—Thanks, Jasper. 
Think no more of it, Jasper. 
(Exit Harry through gate.) 
.TAsPER (c. 
alone. laughs)—I knowed it: I knowed it. 
I 
knowed dat I 
was right. 
Lord bless you, massa, I 
never stole 
nutlin in my life. 
My gracious, how glad de old 'oman will be. 
1'11 go right in and tell her all. 
(Enter Susie in fancy dress.) 
Why, great Ceaser! 
Lord bless your little heart, honey; what 
hub got into you, gal, to put such fixins on. 
SUSIE.—What am de matter, daddie? 
Don't you like dese 
clothes ? 
JASPER — Bless your little soul, honey, whatever pleases 
you, pleases de old man. What you gwine to dowid dose fixins

Why don't you stay at home and read de Bible? 
SUSIE.—Now, daddie. don't begin to give me a

I

JASPER.— No I

No;

I 
wouldn't want you to leave me and de ole 
'oman for de world. 
I

neber had to run away wid your mudder. 
Neber run away, 
Susie, 'case ' taint right ' Taint right, and when Dooley comes 
here dis ebenin' tell him dat I 
want to see him. 
(Exit into cot-
tage.) 
SUSIE.— (
alone) Bless you, good, kind old heart. 
No, daddie, 
you will never see your Susie run away. 
You will never see 
your chile doing wrong. 
You hab been good and kind to me, 
and I 
will obey all your wishes. 
I 
likes to plague de ole man; 
I 
likes to plague everybody, and I 
likes to fool Dooley. 
It 
time dat he was here. 
(Laughs.) I 
know what I 
do; when 
Dooley comes down dis ebenin', I 
will liab some fun wid him— 
I 
will fool him. I 
will go into de house now and wait until he 
comes. 
(Exit into cottage. 
Enter through gate Dooley, in the 
height of fashion.) 
DOOLEY.— (
laughing) Gracious, glorious hallacalugilan! 
I 
wonder if de gal am home. 
Talk about gals! but Susie am too 
sweet for de sun to shine on her. 
(Pause.) 
I 
just come down 
to take Susie to de city to see de fun. 
I bought her a 
new 
dress to go to de ball wid. 
I 'spect she am in de house waiting 
for me. 
If she is I'll bring her out sure. 
(Sings)— 
I 
just come down to see my little Susie, 
She am all de world to me, 
I 
just come down to take her to de ball, 
And for to have some fun. 
We am goin' to be married soon, 
She am all de world to me, 
And if her parients don't consent, 
We'll cut our sticks and run. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, Susie! 
My darling!

Oh, Susie! 
My darling!

DORKINS WAS TIGHT. 
Written by BENJ. D. 
COLLINS. 
Sung by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
The theatre was full, and so were the actors, 
Dan Dorkins was going to appear 
Theit night in a 
barefooted slack- wire clog, 
For he was the Pompey round here; 
The bar- room was fearfully crowded with beats, 
Who awaited a 
pleasant surprise, 
For they knew they would eat 
When the lunch was set out, 
And they longed for the curtain to rise. 
The curtain arose, and so did the people, 
Who began to shout and hurrah ; 
Dan Dorkins came out with young Oliver Twist, 
But they gave him the laugh and yah! yall! 
The play it began when the curtain went up, 
But something was wrong I 
felt sure, 
" 
He's away off his base," says John James Mansfield, 
That never went back on the poor; 
A 
brick—well it was—I 
saw Dorking start, 
And carom on the dark red for two, 
And it made melfeellithirsty to see how he worked. 
But continually dropping his cue. 
He says, "I'm the king !" when a 
woman jumped up, 
Cried, " You lie, for you're one of the gang, 
And you owe me for washing." 
That knocked Dorkins cold, 
And his head on his breast did hang. 
At length the footlights he approached with a 
rush, 
And " Ladies and gentlemen," said, 
" 
If I 
haven't drank enough bourbon to-night, 
The fault is my wealth, not my head. 
Many a 
time I 
have made you all sick, 
And get up and go out for a 
beer, 
When me and Jim Stokes walked a 
mile in a 
week, 
How I 
wish Dan O'Leary was here. 
You insult me to-night and say I 
am sober, 
For years I've been a 
hamlet alone; 
I'll tell you the reason, I 
know you will treat— 
I've a 
mother-in-law dead—drunk at home.

He said, " Yes, I

I 
said, " You'll do

He said, " I

I

bottle, und wrote his name. 
Just den a

und beer)—" Luke Gerloot!" 
De man said, " Come in mit me, 
Mr. Whooping-cough." I 
vent in dere, und his vife vos laying 
on a

He knelt down mid printed a 
kiss on her forehead in large types. 
She took his foot 1:-. her 
hand, looked up, und said, " Oh! Luke is such a 
good husband 
yen he's drunk, but yen sober, he's N. G-1" (de first time I 
ever 
knew she spoke Latin.) 
De man said, " She says I 
am good!" 
at de same time pulling down de neck of his shirt, he showed 
me a 
second-hand scar. 
I 
said, " \Tore you vaccinated dere ?" 
His vife said, " I

done it mit a

Of my lips had been dry yen I

You've heard aboud a 
gal I 
loved, 
Dot used to be so stout, 
How she " shook " me und just because 
I 
vould not take her out 
To balls and parties und all dot, 
Vich I 
dought vas a 
sin, 
But now I've got a 
new sweetheart, 
Und she is awful thin. 
CHORUS. 
She is so thin, dot vere she here, 
You could not see her; 
don't dot seem queer? 
Bad luck have I—oh, I 
shall die, 
My vive is so awfully thin. 
Vere I 
first met dis female straw, 
'Dwas at a 
coundry fair. 
She vos valking long mit her mamma, 
Und she had such nice blonde hair; 
I 
spoke to her, she spoke to me, 
Ye got acquainted den, 
Ve married vere. und after dot 
She commenced to grow thin. 
SPOKEN.—She is the thinnest of the thin. 
She used to vork 
in an insdrument factory, cleaning out flutes; I 
used to play 
" 
Hide und Seek" mit her, und see used to hide in de gas pipe. 
I 
took her oud riding vonce, mad I 
grabbed her instead of de 
whip; I 
never took her oud after dot. 
I 
vos valtzing mit her 
at a 
ball vonce, und de floor manager come up und said, " Young 
man, you vill have to leave your cane in de hat room, it's not 
allowed on de floor! 
I

She is so thin, etc.

DINGELBENDER'S MULE. 
Written and sung by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
I 
keep a 
stable vay up town, und I 
have horses rare, 
De finest teams in all de vorld I'm sure you vill find dere, 
Among de many who have got deir horses in my place, 
Is Dingelbender, und he owns a 
mule vot runs a 
race. 
CHORUS. 
Of all de droubles dot I've had since first I 
vent to school, 
I 
don't dink anyding's as bad as Dingelbender's mule. 
Of I 
go in his stall at night he knows me right avay, 
Und for his broder dree miles off he loudly den vill bray ; 
Dot vakes up all de horses den, und such an awful noise 
As dey vill make, 'twould drive you mad, but I'm vone of de 
boys. 
SPOKEN.—He is vone of de nicest mules, sound und kind in 
harness—of you can ontly get id on him—dot dere is in de 
country. 
He vos an awful kicker dough; he can kick de barn 
into kindling wood in aboud two seconds. 
I 
took him to a 
fair 
vonce, de judge vos going to give him de firsd prize; de mule 
made a 
kick--ye found a 
collar button; ve haven't seen de 
judge dough. I 
clink he vos somevere; he'll come down afder 
a 
vile. 
He ain't much of a 
saddle mule, not dot he you'd trow 
his rider, but de saddle itches his back, und he has a 
habit of 
going up alongside of a 
house, und rubbing a 
fellow's leg off, 
und dot ain't very pleasant. 
Dot's de reason I 
say— 
Of all de droubles, etc.

THE TROMBONE PLAYER. 
Sung by Gus W ILLIAMS, 
I 
vonee vos so jolly, dough now meloncholy, 
Since I 
lost my Kadey I've nearly gone mad; 
A 
servant domesdic, of figure majesdic, 
To fly mit mine rival was rader too had. 
He played a 
drombone in a 
band in de sdreet, 
He'd hand 'round his hat every day; 
For him she has left me, of her he's bereft me, 
My Kadey, dear Kadey, de best in de land. 
She left me to bellar, she vent vit dot feller 
Dot blays de drombone in a 
German sdreet band. 
CHORUS. 
Born, born, born, born, born, de music used to blay, 
As dey dravelled drough de land; 
Und he'd born, born, born, und he bomed my girl avay, 
Did dot fellar in dot German band. 
He'd blay in de sdreet, und each day I 
vould meet 
My Kadey a-valking a 
hold of his hand • 
I 
den saw my fate, I 
knew I 
vas late, 
Und dot she had promised for to join de band. 
I 
asged her de reason, she laughed in my face, 
Und said I 
might go to de doose. 
My faithful love scorning, she left me dot morning, 
My Kadey, dear Kadey, de best in de land; 
I 
know he vill mind her, I 
never shall find her, 
Unless mit dot chap in de German sdreet band. 
Born, born, etc. 
THE WATERMILL. 
As recited by Gus "
W ILLIAMS, at the Olympic Theatre. 
Listen to the watermill, through the livelong day, 
How the clicking of its wheel wears the hours away, 
Languidly the autumn wind stirs the greenwood leaves, 
From the fields the reapers sing, binding up the sheaves; 
And a 
proverb haunts my mind, as a 
spell is cast— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Autumn winds revive no more leaves that once are shed, 
And 
sickle cannot reap corn once gathered; 
And the rippling stream flows on, tranquil, deep and still, 
Never gliding back again to the watermill. 
Truly speaks the proverb old, with a 
meaning vast— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Take the lesson to thyself, loving heart and true, 
Golden years are fleeting by, youth is passing, too; 
Learn to make the most of life, lose no happy day, 
Time will never bring thee back chances swept away. 
Leave no tender word unsaid, love, while love shall last— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Work while yet the daylight shines, man of strength and will, 
Never does the streamlet glide useless by the mill; 
Wait not till to-morrow's sun beams upon the way, 
All that thou canst call thine own lies in thy— to- day, 
Power, intellect and health may not always last— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Oh! the wasted hours of life that have drifted by, 
Oh! the good we might have done, lost without a 
sigh! 
Love that we might once have saved by a 
single word, 
Thoughts conceived, but never penned, perishing unheard, 
Take the proverb to thine heart, take and hold it fast— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Oh love thy God and fellow-man, thyself consider last, 
For come it will, when thou must scan dark errors of the past; 
And when the fight of life is o'er, and earth recedes from view, 
And Heaven in all its glory shines, 'midst the pure, the good 
the true. 
Then you'll see more clearly the proverb deep and vast— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
MI VIFE IS SO AWFULLY STOUD. 
Sung by Gus W ILLIAMS with great success. 
AIR.—" My Vife is so Awfully Thin," 
vonce did love a 
voman, dot used to be so stoud, 
Und people dey you! d 
laugh at her venever she'd valk oud; 
But sdill i 
loved her druly, I 
knew it vos no sin, 
I 
dought dot in de future she you'd gradually grow thin, 
CHORUS. 
She vas so stoud ven she'd valk oud, 
People vould dink dot she vos a 
balloon 
To take demlup—just like a " scup," 
Und make a 
small call on de man in de moon. 
She looked just like an elephant, she had such a 
bigfear, 
But she could valk as lightly as any person here ; 
'L'o tell you all aboud her, I 
now intend to try, 
Und vile I 
am a-speaking, I 
hope you vill not cry. 
SPOKEN.—I'll never forget ven I 
firsd got acquainted mit 
her, she vos travelling mit a 
circus, she vos de fat voman, she 
veighed eight hundred pounds; I 
used to call her " Birdie!" 
her right name vos " Ostrich." I 
took her oud sleigh-riding 
vonce, she got in, und dere vas just room for me to " cut on 
behind." 
I 
looked like an icicle on a 
gutter. 
Ye drove out on 
de road, mid stopped in front of a 
hotel, de proprietor came 
oud und told me to move avay, as no vone could see de hotel 
vile she stayed dere. 
I 
took her bathing vonce, de moment 
she got in de vater, de tide vent up dree foot, she asked me to 
float her i 
I 
tried to, but came near drowning; I 
told her I 
vos 
no derrick! 
But she could dance like a fairy—dot is a 
fairy 
her size; I 
used, in valtzing, to put my arm around her vaist 
as far as I 
could, und reach mit a 
boat- hook de rest of de dis-
tance; und she vos an awful eater, she could eat a 
vater-melon 
just as easy as I 
vould take a 
pill. 
I 
took de size of her finger 
vonce to have an engagement ling made; I 
vent down to de 
jeweller. I 
said, " Make me a 
ring dis size, und I 
vant it to lit 
veil." 
He said, " Bring de keg down here, und let me fit it 
OD" I 
don't speak to her now, because she vanted me to 
take her to a masquerade ball disguised as a 
pipe stem. I 
knew dot every vone vould laugh at me if I 
done so, for 
She vos so stolid, etc.

DORKINS' NIGEET. 
Written by BOBBY NENYCOMB, and sung with great success by 
W ILLIAM SCANLAN, at the Olympic Theatre, Broadway, N. Y. 
Mush; published by Joux PE:Buy, Washington St., opposite nostog 
Theatre, Boston, Mass. 
The theatre was full— it was Dorkins' night 
That is, Dorkins was going to appear 
At night, in a 
favorite comedy part, 
For he was comedian here. 
Funny ! why, he'd make you laugh, till the tears 
Ran down your face like rain; 
And every time he came on the stage, 
You'd try to stop laughing in vain. 
A 
family? yes, he'd a 
family, 
And he lov'd them as dear as his life; 
And you'd scarcely find a 
happier lot 
Than Dorkins' children and wife. 
And you'd scarcely find a 
happier lot 
Than Dorkins' children and wife. 
There came one night, and I 
was in front, 
And Dorkins was going to play 
A 
character new to himself and the stage, 
Which he'd trod for many a 
day. 
By eight the theatre was perfectly jammed, 
All awaited a 
pleasant surprise; 
For they knew they'd laugh ' till their sides would ache 
And they long'd for the curtain to rise. 
The play soon began—each neck was stretched forth, 
And eagerly watched each eye, 
For Dorkins to make his first entrance, and then 
To give him a 
cheerful hi! ltil 
For Dorkins to make his first entrance, and the& 
To give him a 
cheerful hi 1 
hi! 
4 t 
At last he appeared, amid loud applause, 
But something was wrong you could see; 
" 
Why, Dorkins is playing quite badly to-night!" 
The people said, sitting 'round me. 
A 
hiss 
yes, it was; I 
saw Dorkins start 
As if stung by a 
serpent's fang; 
And he'd cast a 
beseeching look all ' round, 
While his head on his breast he would hang. 
" 
He's drunk!" some one said, and I 
thought so myself, 
For, to me, it was awful at times, 
To see how he'd struggle along with his part, 
And continually stick in his lines; 
To see how he'd struggle along with his part, 
And continually stick in his lines. 
The footlights, at last, lie approached very slow, 
And, " Ladies and gentlemen," said— 
"If I 
cannot please you to- night, 
The fault's not the heart, but the head. 
There's many a 
night I've made you all laugh, 
When so ill I 
could scarcely well stand; 
And every effort was pain to me then— 
Yes, if even I'd raise but my hand. 
You hiss me to-night, and say that I'm drunk," 
From his heart came a 
sob and a 
moan; 
"I'll tell you the reason—I 
know you won't laugh— 
I've a 
little one dying at home) 
•

know you won't laugh—

Did you ever go into a

Arere they give you a 
free lunch mit a 
beer? 
And ven de barkeeper's back is turned, 
How the burns to the counter they all steer. 
CHORUS. 
Beefsteak pie, they all cry; 
And they chew as they never chewed before; 
Oyster pie, vat do you soi ? 
We'll have beats on that beautiful shore. 
You can see them any hour of the day, 
Around on the corners vere they stand, 
Awaiting for some one to treat, 
They would break up any soup-house in the land. 
CHORUS. 
Mutton pie, they all cry, 
For a 
free lunch all night they loudly roar, 
And when they die, by-and- bye, 
We'll have beats on that beautiful shore.

ARTISTIC SONG AND DANCE. 
Written by BEN Coudxs. 
Don't talk of new sensations, 
For I'm sure I 
take the lead, 
And ere I'm done most everyone, 
Will say I'm right indeed; 
Just watch me for a 
moment 
And your sorrows I'll beguile, 
I'll try my best to please you with 
My own fantastic style. 
CHORUS. 
Watch the motion I'll go through, (Break) 
Here's another that's quite new, (

I'm happy when I'm dancing, 
And it never seems a

To amuse you with my singing and 
My own peculiar style. 
(Dance.) 
I'm always fond of music, 
I 
couldlisten all day long, 
I 
love to play my harp and sing 
To all this happy throng; 
I 
am different•from every one, 
So just listen for awhile, 
And I'll show you something neater, 
In my own peculiar style. 
Watch the motion, etc. 
I 
do not sing of beauties, 
But I'll leave it all to you, 
Is there anything as graceful 
As the motion of my shoe? 
You can search the world all over, 
You can travel mile and mile, 
And you'll find I've not an equal 
In my own peculiar style. 
Watch the motion, etc.

A

One day I

A

The fat woman sat on a

a 
leedle boy on her knee. 
She was hugging and kissing him fondly 
And called him her own leedle dear, 
Of de fat voman sat on de boy, dough, 
Now Youldn't dot seem very queer.

Bill Tweed has escaped from de brison, 
Und de bolice are looking quite blue, 
He didn't hafe time to shake hands, but 
Avay from de cidy he flew. 
De sheriff is crazy to catch him, 
He's searched for him both far and near;

But she's got a

Dough her face is de vorst von dot der I

Una von she sits down to have her pictures tooker, 
De very first glance she gives breaks de machine. 
My lite is all droubles, I

I 
said to her vonce, " Ven I

I 
did not intend de whole family to ved." 
Deu she quickly caught hold of a 
bucket of vater. 
Und taking good aim let it go at my head. 
I

Dot do slims vas so close it vas almost a

But I'll bet ten dollars dot nothing can equal 
Dot iron-clad gunboat, my mother-iz-law.
