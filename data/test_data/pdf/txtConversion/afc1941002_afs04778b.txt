had been around all my, if I had, if he had lived now I might, I never would be like him. I never would
like him. Never under [heaven (?)]. I figure on some day writing young Jeff where, send me to go
there. Go over there where he is. I'm a write himanyhow, un, un, this week or next week. ’I want
some money. Yes, I am. I'm a write him. I need it. You know what I tell him what I need? For I get

Dr. Charles S. Johnson: Hmm
Mr. George Johnson: I get some coal for the winter, understand. You see. And I write him he send
it to me. I need it. He never will tell me no. Now when I ask him, tell him things right. Some people
ask a man for money for, for-r, for whatever; and he don't tell, he don't have time for no money
now. Because he got plenty money. That's a mistake. That's because I need. Say, ‘I need coal for the

can get a little cord, cord wood. You see. Block wood, you understand, for about four dollars, you
understand. You see. Well now, we should get rain hard, winter come, it cost me ten dollars. See
now? That's how it is. Because coal will cost more, more always cost more if you get it at the depot
there. For to haul put my yard shed, you understand. Something about three-and-a-half, and I do all
right. But don't take this go with you time get a hard raining. Because while they getting wood and,
out the woods to the ah gravel road, then you got to haul here, you know. Six miles. That's too long.
Only treat him like he treat me. He nice to me, I'm nice to him.
Dr. Charles S. Johnson: Ah, are there any musicians around here now?
Mr. George Johnson: No, sir. All my past music all them fellas, they all dead. They all gone.

Dr. Charles S. Johnson: Are there any, any fiddlers or banjo players left in the country? It's hard to
find a banjo player now.
Mr. George Johnson: No, sir. No, sir. Ain't none here. They started a little band at school there. Way
at school there. And you know what I'm saying? I sat out there and hear them try a play a piece. And
pray my lord. I stared and looked and looked and listened and listened, go down near the [county (?)]

practice three times a week. Practice Monday night. Thursday night. I mean, Wednesday night and
Friday night. Every night we play a brand new piece. Stay until two o'clock play a piece of music. But
these young musicians now they, they, they, they head ain't even right. They, they head ain't right.
They ain't got no room in-in-in there for common sense. That's a fact. Use their head just for hat
rack.
Dr. Charles S. Johnson: [laughs]
Mr. George Johnson: That's [poor (?)]. That's just [poor (?)]. I'm, I'm, you know what I'm saying?
I'm really glad I come up in the old days, so I know things. Young men don't talking about say, ‘He
don't know.’ Good thing he learn how to read and write and, and before he check on somebody I
know that's all you, all you can can do. Before he check on somebody. Fool somebody. Try and fool
somebody. Somebody put him in jail. And there he go. [disc scratch] Man, it's just common sense. I
tell you truth.
Dr. Charles S. Johnson: Well, ah you don't have any boys going through here now trying to fiddle or
play a banjo? You don't run, run into them now?
Mr. George Johnson: No, sir. I heard gang here, I believe this morning, yesterday morning, right out
there on the road there. I didn't get up to go out there to see.

about it. I pass along myself.
