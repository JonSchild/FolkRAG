INTERVIEW LOG 
 
00:00:40:  Name is Adelina Martinez.  Lives in Hillsboro, Oregon.  Born in 1969 in Cuernavaca, 
Mexico in the State of Morelos. 
 
00:01:40:  Other jobs have been teacher’s assistant, work at a pre-school, instruction for children 
at home, jobs in the fields, hotels, restaurants. 
 
00:02:57:  Has a child who is twenty years old.  Started as home provider for him ten months ago 
but has cared for him since 1994. 
 
00:04:01:  Other person helps care for her son.  Has two children with disabilities.  What’s 
important is that as a mother I understand needs of my child:  appointments, therapy, meetings.  
Involved in everything and always with him. 
 
00:05:40:  Has to act as “translator” for child because of way he speaks:  others cannot always 
understand him. 
 
00:06:25:  Home care in contrast to other jobs:  more personal, requires lots of patience.  Son 
gives me that patience.  Son is easy going and always has a smile.  He is a “happy boy.” 
 
00:08:00:  Need to be understanding, available, responsible. 
 
00:09:06:  Learned on her own about caregiving.  Not only by being a mother.  Therapist shows 
her things.  Form of learning for her. 
 
00:10:30:  Typical day:  bathing, teach child to be independent, help him get dressed, put shoes 
on proper foot, read books, give foot massages when needed. 
 
00:12:15:  Sometimes when meeting with other caregivers:  talk about schedules, proper lifting, 
how to handle difficult situations.

00:15:42:  Humor necessary with children.  Children feel it when someone is happy or sad. 
 
00:16:30:  Helping a child be independent is gratifying.  When parents are not around, hopes her 
child will be self-sufficient, be able to prepare a meal. 
 
00:18:27:  Frustrating not to know about resources such as things that can help with getting into 
a tub or onto a toilet.  Resources not fully explained.  Hears about resources by word of mouth 
from other parents.  Good to know about other parents who have children with disabilities. 
 
00:23:25:  Is member of the union but doesn’t know who to connect with.  Had a bad situation 
with another provider who was speaking to union organizer and she had to take care of her child.  
Was not a union member at that point. 
 
00:27:30:  Realized that she could be a provider herself.  Joined union recently. 
 
00:30:29:  As mother, takes care of children and their specific needs.  Has time to do that.  Her 
work but also that of her family.  Support to give children what they need. 
 
00:32:12:  Before:  had to rely on other people.  Others tried to take care of her child.  Some 
afraid to do so.  Others would charge a lot more and not do everything that a child needs. 
 
00:33:41:  To relax: takes walks with her husband, has coffee with friends. 
 
00:34:55:  Children have same feelings as everybody else.  They have a sincere love for others.  
No bad or malicious thoughts. 
 
00:36:28:  Difficult for a mother to separate emotions that she might have.  Friday “escapades” 
with friends are important given how hard her work week has been.  Helps her unwind. 
 
00:37:29:  End of interview.
