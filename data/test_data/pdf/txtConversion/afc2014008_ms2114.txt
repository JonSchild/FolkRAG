U.S.  Policies and Cultural Continuity
 1/9/95
 
(as  read)
 
I offer my observations on certain of the
 
policies pertaining to traditional music developed by the
 
government of the United States as a case study rather than a
 
model.  These remarks also reflect a work in progress.  Indeed,
 
when I return home in a few weeks,  I hope  I shall  find that
 
work still progressing.
 
The notion that governments,  outside of royal
 
kingdoms,  should have anything to do with any of the arts  is
 
a relatively recent  idea.  However,  it has certainly caught
 
hold.  The twentieth century,  especially in its  latter half,
 
has  seen a remarkable  increase  in active governmental
 
participation in the arts arena.
 
The particular history of  individual nations
 
appears to have  set the tone and style of their emergent arts
 
policies.  Art historians Cummings and Katz point out that
 
nations which emerged from earlier absolutist  states,  where
 
art patronage had been a privileged royal custom of long
 
standing,  have tended to continue that pattern in more
 
contemporary terms,  providing often substantial government
 
funds directly to national theaters,  art museums and training
 
institutions.  Russia and France may serve as historical
 
examples.
 
More mercantile nations with a history of  limited
 
monarchies and
 powerful plutocracies -
 e.g.  Great Britain or
 
the Netherlands -
 have allowed far less  lavish governmental
 
arts  spending,  practiced generally by a bureaucratic process
 
often described as  "at arms  length".  One common such pattern
 
has been to set up a two stage process:  the total amount of
 
money to be spent by the government on arts activities  is
 
agreed on by the legislature;  an independent agency such as
 
an arts council decides on how and by whom this overall  sum
 
is to be  spent,  tt r
ns distancing the  final action from
 
governmental  influence.

A third and final group includes  such young democracies
 
as the United States  and Canada which have only recently,
 
somewhat  reluctantly and with suspicion provided any public
 
moneys whatever for arts activities.  The philosophy that the
 
best government  is the least government was not a recent
 
discovery by United States voters;  it has been a sub-current
 
in American political thought  since the Revolution.
 
Indeed,  leaving aside earlier issues connected with
 
literary copyright  law,  it was not until the great depression
 
of the  1930's that the United States government was  impelled
 
into any real interaction with the arts world.  At that,  it
 
was  initially a forced marriage arising inexorably out of the
 
overall policies of the Works Progress Administration which
 
was established to put unemployed Americans back to work by
 
finding or creating them jobs  in their own areas of
 
expertise.  Under the terms of this remarkable piece of social
 
legislation,  if you were a carpenter,  the WPA would try to
 
find or create you a job in the building trades;  similarly if
 
you were a painter,  you could be paid a minimal living
 
stipend by the WPA to paint;  writers to write,  musicians to
 
play music.
 
There were some  complications of course.  I once met a
 
concert violinist  from the rural  state of Oklahoma,  who told
 
me that during the depression years  she had been commissioned
 
by the state WPA Music Program to teach a group of musicians
 
how to read music.  Curious about this odd assignment,  she met
 
with the group to discover that they were all local country
 
fiddlers who had been sitting drearily in the Oklahoma
 
Symphony Orchestra violin section for months drawing down
 
their desperately needed WPA checks but not allowed to draw
 
even one  long bow.  She was able,  I must reassure you,  to set
 
up a much more appropriate and useful project of sending the
 
gentlemen to give free performances on local dance floors
 
where they aided greatly in improving community morale.
 
The humane principles of the WPA did not  survive the
 
labor-hungry demands  of oncoming World War II.  The United
 
 
I
 
3
 
States Government  returned to its  former distant
 
relationship with the world of the arts,  its most  radical
 
move being to provide some  funds  for
 
overseas broadcasts.  Otherwise it maintained an essentially
 
custodial attitude,  expressed through the mammoth Smithsonian
 
Institution,  our national museum,  as well as
 the Library of
 
Congress which housed the  important Archive of American Folk
 
Song and later the American Folklife Center.
 
(Locating the American Folklife Center at the Library of
 
Congress was a politically dictated last-minute
 
improvisation;  it had initially been thought of as an
 
independent agency or perhaps one of the branches of the
 
Smithsonian.  It has never been a truly comfortable home.  Alan
 
Lomax has  since pointed out that  libraries are set up to take
 
care of square things,  and folklorists and ethnomusicologists
 
tend to produce and deal with round or irregular-shaped
 
things;  it  is quite possible that this geometric discrepancy
 
has been part of the difficulties the Center has  since faced.
 
Round or square,  the whole enterprise has frequently almost
 
fallen victim to the anti-government-in-the-arts philosophy
 
so prevalent  in the cyclical eruptions of anti-government-in-
anything American beliefs.)
 
In  1965,  as part of President Lyndon Johnson's Great
 
Society program,  the United States Government took an
 
unprecedented step into the unfamiliar waters of cultural
 
activism:  it established twin grant-giving agencies -
 the
 
National Endowment  for the Humanities and the National
 
Endowment  for the Arts.
 
The Arts Endowment  initially organized itself into
 
discipline-based programs which were to give ancillary
 
financial  support to theater,  dance,  visual arts,  opera,
 
music,  literature et al.  For example,  all forms of dance -
-
ballet,  hula,  tap,  modern,  gagaku  (bugaku),  moon-walking,
 
whatever -
-
 could theoretically receive grants of public
 
moneys  from the Dance Program.  Intellectually and
 
emotionally,  this was  and is an attractive concept to the
 
4
 
tidy bureaucratic mind -
-
 that each discipline should and
 
would support and celebrate  its own root traditions.  In
 
actual practice,  however,  in order to screen out  innumerable
 
amateur enthusiasts,  local commercial dance  studios and the
 
like,  Dance Program guidelines tended to require various
 
combinations of  lengthy performance seasons,  paid dancers,
 
specific budget  or staff sizes,  etc.  thereby
  
 
but effectively ruling out of consideration all but the more
 
well organized semi-professional dance troupes or training
 
institutions.
 
Clearly,  the very real problems of the American Ballet
 
Theater were  just not the  same as those of an Idaho American
 
Indian tribe wanting to revive its old Squash Dance that
 
nobody had done  for years  so that the essential and elaborate
 
costume regalia had to be remade at a serious expense in
 
labor and materials.  Nor were they the  same as those of a
 
small Finnish-American community in the Michigan Upper
 
Peninsula whose only winterized dance  floor was  finally
 
collapsing after years and years of being polka-ed and
 
t
h
'PPr
 
schottisched
4v­
,-
_r by well-nourished Finnish couples.  These
 
events were simply of a different order than a ballet gala or
 
a choreographers workshop.  There was no way to compare or
 
contrast their significance or meaning;  it wasn't even a
 
question of trying to compare apples and oranges  
 
more  like
 
watermelons and sugarcane.
 
The Arts Endowment took a leisurely route towards
 
addressing these issues.  During the agency's  first twelve
 
years,  funding policies  for the major artistic disciplines
 
were set  in place and minority arts groups that had already
 
organized themselves  into the structures and procedures of
 
the professional arts world were given their own special
 
funding category. (Expansion Arts) .
 Occasional experimental
 
dips  into that vast other world of American artistic
 
activities did occur,  but  it was not until  1977 that a real
 
niche was  carved out  for them with the establishment of the
 
c
 
5
 
Folk and Traditional Arts Program with its own guidelines,
 
its own policies,  its own budget.
 
I had the enormous good luck to be there throughout the
 
first  fifteen years of that program's adventure,  acting as
 
directorX' 
t of a staff of one,  that  later ballooned into
 
a princely six.  I' m going to speak about the program in a
 
little detail,  partly because  I believe it cleared some new
 
ground by attempting to develop a theoretically testable
 
basis  for  its work.  That work began in an atmosphere of
 
extreme urgency.  The  synthetic charms of mass culture were
 
daily drowning out the voices of  less amplified and more
 
specialized cultures;  memories of the  sad and sudden demise
 
of the WPA kept  reminding us that unusual and experimental
 
programs,  especially those crossing class  lines,  might not
 
survive very long;  and the  funds we had available  for our use
 
were extremely limited.
 
We were already committed by early definitions to a
 
multi-disciplinary approach including musical,  visual and
 
literary artistic traditions as  found among all family and
 
community groups,  whether ethnic,  religious,  occupational or
 
geographic.  And we were operating in opposition to the
 
previous  federal philosophy of the WPA when funds determined
 
by federal policies and federal projects  showered down
 
equally upon the sublime and the ridiculous alike.  We were
 
now to work within the competitive granting world where
 
people had to come to us with their projects planned;  we
 
could not tell them what to do.  We could be  flirtatious and
 
suggest that we would certainly enjoy funding certain types
 
of projects,  but we had no muscle enabling us to order such
 
projects  into existence as the WPA could and did.  Finally,
 
the Folk Arts  staff itself had no true authority.  We relied
 
upon outside panels to
 rants which
 
we then had to win approval for through an inter-locking
 
series of Endowment  committees and councils,  basically
 
selling them to the Endowment.
 
 
I

There seemed no advantage,  though.  in being mealy-
mouthed or bashful;  the Endowment was  just going to have to
 
cope with the existence of the Folk Arts Program head on.  We
 
began by behaving as though a policy of cultural pluralism -
 
a phrase coined by Alan Lomax -
 was already in effect
 
throughout the agency -
-
 and in a way,  because we had said so
 
and meant  it,  it was.  The conceptual ground rule was that the
 
artistic productions of every culture,  when practiced at
 
their aesthetic peak,  were as deserving of governmental
 
support as any
 European-based fine art.  And it turned out to
 
be very awkward for Americans,  reared in a basically
 
egalitarian tradition,  to publicly counter this position,
 
even if they didn't quite believe it.
 
We began to elaborate.  Folk Arts projects would never be
 
spoken of by staff in terms that  suggested they were either
 
pathetic or comical.  No matter how oddly dressed,  shambling,
 
or  socially unimpressive their practitioners,  they were to be
 
referred to respectfully as  "folk artists",  and what they
 
did,  from harmonica blowing to basket weaving,  was to be
 
called "art".  We elevated this rule by titling it  "framing",
 
an activity through which,  by placing a frame around a part
 
of the seamless web of human activity,  you give the enclosed
 
area a certain  focus,  cachet,  importance.
 
The underlying goal of framing was to convince,  not
 
simply the Endowment,  but every local community we dealt with
 
of the intrinsic value of their particular art  forms.  Over
 
and over we had found local artists refusing to pass along
 
their skills  claiming that  "nobody wants that old stuff
 
anymore",  and often enough they were right.  Charles Seeger
 
once pointed out:
 
Gradual loss of the oldest  songs  in a repertory,  while
 
new materials are being added,  is a normal course of a
 
vigorous tradition,  But where the loss of the older
 
materials  is almost total and the new has  little of
 
the nature of oral tradition and so is hard to
 
digest,  even the middle-aged materials may have gone by
 
7
 
the board and the very process of oral transmission
 
thwarted for lack of occasion for its  cultivation.
 
We began to try to provide  such occasions by a funding
 
policy:  to support needy activities within the artists'  own
 
communities.  We wanted the action there,  not  in the nearest
 
big city.  One powerful  strategy turned out to be the
 
development of touring troupes of master artists  from a
 
particular ethnicity or occupation performing
 
master classes  in outlying communities of the
 
where the tradition had perhaps weakened.  The
 
and giving
 
same group,
 
Folk Arts
 
cowboy music tour,  for example,  had a real impact not only in
 
c ct-'
 
the  small towns of the western-mainland but among the
 
paniolos
of the big island of Hawaii.
 
Among all our early problems,  the most  insistent was how
 
to  limit our responsibilities.  We  just did not have the  funds
 
to serve  in major ways all our enormous constituency,  and we
 
did not want to disappoint people by seeming to offer them
 
the world and then backing off.  Panelist and
 
ethnomusicologist Fred Lieberman gave us an important
 
strategic hint.  He remarked that we might try to take an
 
artistic event -
-
 say,
 
in a Mississippi rural
 
into the  succession of
 
about,  starting as  far
 
a residency by a local blues guitarist
 
public school -
-
 and break it down
 
things that had to happen to bring it
 
back as we could think,  even perhaps
 
to the composition of the particular music.  After the plot-
line,  so to say,  of each type of event had been established,
 
we could then consider at which particular points along the
 
historical  line,  outside money was useful or even desirable.
 
We had only money to work with,  you see,  and money,  as  I came
 
to discover,  is,  culturally speaking,  a blunt  instrument.  It
 
has great power -
-
 but  it  lacks precision,  and We had to
 
provide that.
 
For example,  when small marginal not-for-profit ethnic
 
and regional record companies came to us for general support,
 
we tried to look carefully into their actual needs.  It turned
 
8
 
out that they were already producing a remarkably number of
 
well conceived tapes and c. d.s.  But when financial
 
difficulties  loomed,  they tended to cut out their record note
 
inserts,  cut back their  jacket and brochure art design
 
budgets,  and not pay the musicians,  promising them royalties
 
instead.  We therefore  limited out grant  support to those
 
three areas,  and were gratified to see that the overall
 
production standards  for minority musical recordings rose
 
noticeably after a few years.
 
We tried the interesting trick of being simultaneously
 
broadly inclusive and tightly focussed.  We first opened our
 
funding categories to any kind of legally eligible
 
organization or artistic group,  inside or outside the
 
culture,  but then we  said they could only spend our money on
 
activities directly furthering the music or art traditional
 
to a group and their senior artists.  We knew this to be a
 
debatable policy -
-
 and it was certainly debated -
-
 but we
 
believed strongly that the  job of supporting the oldest
 
cultural  forms and styles  still extant was one that only the
 
Folk Arts Program would actually undertake,  while worthy new
 
emerging art  forms could often find assistance elsewhere.  We
 
also saw again and again that  small cultural groups without
 
vigorous older traditions  lacked a strong sense of cultural
 
identity and seemed weakened and uncertain.
 
A final important  strategy.  We determined that all Folk
 
Arts projects  should be as elegantly produced and as
 
historically accurate as possible so that everyone could be
 
proud of the results.  We therefore required the inclusion in
 
project budgets of production specialists as well as cultural
 
specialists.  Exactly who would fill these roles was  left up
 
to the group doing the project;  this policy generally
 
resulted in an  interesting balance of  insider/outsider
 
participation.
 
Overall,  I am proud of what happened during my fifteen
 
years  service even though when I retired the programs'  budget
 
was  still no more than 2%  of the Endowment's overall funds.
 
9
 
Most Americans  still think that European "fine" arts are
 
somehow finer than anybody else's fine arts,  and I do not
 
know if that will ever change.  But the overall Folk Arts
 
budget did grow from a few hundred thousand to 4 million
 
during my tenure.  More importantly,  I do not think that the
 
United States can ever in future  set up a national arts
 
program which does not  include what most people are now
 
comfortable in calling the  folk and traditional arts.  And
 
that  is 
a big change.

 There  simply isn t.
aoug- time but
 
I  will  just touch on two other major cultural strategies
 
practiced by other nations'
r we all  stand to learn from
 
them.
 
First  is the hands-off decentralized strategy noticeable
 
in Great Britain,  Canada,  Australia and most of the English-
speaking world.  This
 arms-length philosophy,  where the
 
independence of grantees and the minimizing of governmental
 
influence  is emphasized,  has many clear advantages even
 
though it  is generally based on the assumption that all
 
participating groups -
-
 ethnic,  native and other -
-
 are
 
internally homogeneous,  well versed in democratic principles,
 
and up to date  in scholarly research.  In the United States  so
 
far this has not generally been the case.  But times change.
 
The Folk Arts Program has expended much effort  in helping
 
applicants  learn how the granting system works;  perhaps  in
 
future a more arms-length position could be tenable with us.
 
A second approach has been taken by many so-called
 
"third world" nations,  of eastern Europe and Asia.  A major
 
part of this  strategy has been to support and present
 
particular traditional arts as public  icons-- representative
 
of the regional or national ethos.  In pursuit of this goal,
 
special local and regional  schools have been developed where
 
senior traditional artists  instruct talented young hopefuls.
 
10
 
Professional national  companies tour internally and abroad,
 
presenting exciting and dramatic interpretations of local
 
cultural traditions.  In an era of mass  communication,  the
 
sheer accessibility of this approach is  its greatest
 
advantage.  Emerging young nations  in Africa and the far East
 
have used it to great economic and political value.
 
In the United States  such professionalization has been
 
approached very cautiously, tend to look at  such companies
 
withAconcern because of our experience with the devouring
 
national popular music industry where novelty,  youth,
 
athleticism and noisiness tend to capture all the outlets,
 
too often  leaving the older,  quieter,  not -ever-ready-for-
prime-time artists unheard.  Not every music is appropriate
 
for the big stage and the mass audience,  and yet they may
 
feed that  stage  in ways we do not now recognize as clearly as
 
influences that  led to the development  of  jazz,
 
country music and rhythm and blues.
 
Certainly,  one of the primary deficiencies  in the
 
American system of governmental traditional arts  support  is
 
that we have not yet  learned how to promote the traditional
 
arts through the mass media successfully,  except,  perhaps,
 
in the area of recordings.  And these days,  if artists are
 
never seen on television,  they almost don't exist.  We have
 
come a bit closer to success  in this area through an
 
adaptation of the Japanese  idea of "intangible cultural
 
resources" evidenced by their "national cultural treasures."
 
The American National Heritage Fellowships,  awarded to some
 
twelve significant practicing traditional artists every year
 
have garnered both national and local publicity and
 
widespread approval and are today being replicated in
 
individual  states across the country.
 
My friends,  the world became concerned about the
 
destruction of the natural environment  far earlier than  it
 
began to worry about the destruction of its cultural
 
resources.  Indeed,  when  I started at the Arts Endowment  I
 
remember thinking that  since human beings as they spread over
 
11
 
the planet had become  so efficient  in wiping out differing
 
cultures along with their arts,  all  I. ad to do was  just the
 
opposite,  whatever that was.
 
But we  
 
be more sophisticated.  We have to
 
continue directing our most  serious thinking not  just to the
 
recording and replication of either the old styles or the
 
latest attempts to catch the popular music brass  ring,  but to
 
the  continuance of the local musics as potential creative
 
engines,  producing works  suitable for the past,  the present
 
and the future.  At conferences such as this we may be able,
 
if we choose to face this great task,  to develop truly long-
range strategies that will help our world of multiple  sounds
 
last  far beyond our own years -
 and ears.

U.S.  Policies and Cultural Continuity
 12 /1 0
 
By way of preamble
 
Twenty-five years ago a British anthropologist teaching
 
a graduate course in Minority Cultures at a California
 
university startled his  students -
-
 I was one -
-
 by
 
announcing that the United States would be ruled entirely out
 
of the discussion.  "You Americans," he pointed out,  "think
 
your country is the only one in the world with minority
 
problems.  I want you to spend a whole semester thinking
 
outside your own national situation;  and we will begin by
 
considering the national minority policies of the
 
Netherlands,  a nation which I am choosing precisely because
 
the complexity of its  situation within  its  extremely small
 
geographic boundaries will  startle you."
 
I was  indeed startled.  Cultural disjunctions and
 
dislocations that  I had been thinking of as exclusive to the
 
United States turned out to be common all round the world.
 
There wasn't anything so special about my country's
 
experience;  this was a world-wide phenomenon not  likely to go
 
away any time soon.
 
And so this morning I can confidently assume that every
 
nation represented here is experienced,  of course  in varying
 
fdrms and to varying extents,  with complex multi-cultural
 
problems.  Perhaps we can help each other;  perhaps we can even
 
learn from each other -
 that might be more difficult.  I shall
 
confine my remarks to aesthetic concerns and will begin by
 
sketching the barest outline of my own country's experience
 
in attempting to work out policies to make room for all the
 
musics that were born  in or found their way to the United
 
States.
 
The  first task was to realize that they were there at
 
all.  The earliest British settlers were not musically
 
inexperienced;  Thomas Jefferson played string quartet music,
 
Benjamin Franklin had strong and sophisticated opinions on
 
topical songs.  The great  church music of the Mediterranean
 
2
 
world and
 early Spanish light operas were performed in
 
southwestern states before the war with Mexico.
 
But European musical class distinctions were  imported
 
into the new world along with European languages.  By the mid-
nineteenth century the term "music" was effectively reserved
 
in the United States e
 lc
t for the high arts music of
 
Europe or its American imitations.  In spite of many attempts
 
to include arts training in public school curricuJ,a,  the
 
A-
 J
.
 
cultivation of music was effectively reserved for the class
 
/
\
 
that could- pay for music instruction.  And music itself1 moved
 
gradually into a larger category -
-
 "the arts" -
-
 generally
 
meaning all aesthetic activities of a formal nature,  almost
 
invariably dependent upon western European models.  I remember
 
during my own lifetime first hearing someone talk about  "the
 
arts" and thinking it was a sort of odd and unusual term,  and
 
I didn't  like it much.  I' ve gotten used to it  since,  along
 
with much of the rest of the world where  it also seems to be
 
a fairly recent  concept.
 
The notion that governments,  outside of royal
 
kingdoms,  should have anything to do with any
 
called "arts"  is another relatively new idea.
 
certainly caught hold.  The twentieth century,
 
of the so-
However, it has
 
especially in
 
its  latter half,  has  seen a remarkable increase in active
 
governmental participation in the arts arena.  This  is most
 
conveniently documentable in western European nations but
 
quite evident as well  in Russia,  China,  many African nations,
 
the near

east,  and the Pacific.
 
particular history of  individual nations appears to
 
the tone and style of their emergent arts policies.
 
Art historians Cummings and Katz point out that nations which
 
emerged from earlier absolutist  states,  where art patronage
 
had been a privileged royal custom of long standing,  have
 
tended to continue that pattern in more contemporary terms,
 
providing
governntent  funds directly to national theaters,  art
 
museums and training institutions.  Russia and France may
 
serve as examples.
 
3
 
More mercantile nations with a history of limited
 
monarchies and
 powerful plutocracies -
 e.g.  Great Britain or
 
the Netherlands -
 have allowed far less lavish governmental
 
arts  spending,  practiced generally by a bureaucratic process
 
often described as  "at arms  length".  One common such pattern
 
has been to set up a two stage process:  the total
 amount of
 
money to be spent by the government on arts activities  is
 
agreed on by the legislature;  an independent agency such as
 
an arts council decides on how and by whom this overall  sum
 
is to be  spent.
 
A third and final group includes  such young democracies
 
as the United States and Canada which have only reluctantly
 
and with a good deal of suspicion provided
 public moneys
 
w
±-ev r for arts activities of any kind.  The philosophy that
 
the best government is the  least government was not a recent
 
discovery by United States voters;  it has been a sub-current
 
in American political thought  since
 Revolution.
 
Indeed,  leaving aside earlier issues connected with
 
literary copyright  law,  it was not until the great depression
 
of the  1930's that the United States government was impelled
 
into any real interaction with the arts world.  At that,  it
 
was  initially a forced marriage arising inexorably out of the
 
overall policies of the Works Progress Administration which
 
was established to put unemployed Americans back to work by
 
finding or creating them jobs  in their own areas of
 
expertise.  Under the terms of this remarkable piece of social
 
legislation,  if you were a carpenter,  the WPA would try to
 
find or create you a job in the building trades;  similarly if
 
you were a painter,  you could be paid a minimal living
 
stipend by the WPA to paint;  writers to write,  musicians to
 
play music.
 
There were  some complications of course.  I once met a
 
concert violinist from the rural  state of Oklahoma,  who told
 
me that during the depression years she had been commissioned
 
by the state WPA Music Program to teach a group of musicians
 
how to read music.  Curious about this odd assignment,  she met
 
4
 
with the group to discover that they were all local country
 
fiddlers who had been sitting drearily in the Oklahoma
 
Symphony Orchestra violin section for months drawing down
 
their desperately needed WPA checks but unable to
 
participate.  She was able,  I must reassure you,  to set up a
 
much more appropriate and useful project of documenting their
 
repertoires and sending the gentlemen to give free
 
performances on local dance floors where they aided greatly
 
in  improving community morale.
 
The humane principles of the WPA did not  survive the
 
labor-hungry demands of oncoming World War II.  The United
 
States Government returned to its  former uneasy relationship
 
with the world of the arts and generally confined itself to
 
providing some  funding for overseas broadcasts through the
 
State Department  in pursuit of the Cold War,  assisting the
 
mammoth Smithsonian Institution with certain of its artistic
 
exhibitions and educational programs,  and funding the central
 
Library of Congress which housed not only the Archive of
 
American Folk Song but the American Folklife Center,
 
established there by Congressional mandate in 1976.
 
(Locating the American Folklife Center at the Library of
 
Congress was a politically dictated last-minute
 
improvisation;  it had initially been thought of as an
 
independent agency or perhaps one of the branches of the
 
Smithsonian.  It has never been a truly comfortable home.  Alan
 
Lomax has  since pointed out that  libraries are set up to take
 
care of square things,  and folklorists and ethnomusicologists
 
tend to produce and deal with round or irregular-shaped
 
things;  it  is quite possible that this geometric discrepancy
 
has been part of the difficulties the Center has  since  faced.
 
Round or square,  the whole enterprise has  frequently almost
 
fallen victim to the anti-government-in-the-arts philosophy
 
so prevalent  in the cyclical eruptions of anti-government-in-
anything American beliefs.)
 
In  1965,  as part of President Lyndon Johnson's Great
 
Society program,  the United States Government took an
 
5
 
unprecedented step into the unfamiliar waters of cultural
 
activism:  it established twin grant-giving agencies -
 the
 
National Endowment  for the Humanities and the National
 
Endowment  for the Arts.  Both were strictly limited by all
 
manner of congressional concerns,  most especially in the Arts
 
Agency where the slightest hint that it might try to
 
establish any "official" or  "national" art  form or arts
 
institution was anathema.
 
Since the United States  itself consists of a complex
 
confederation of states,  its art policy,  the Congress
 
believed,  must  reflect  such a complex constituency.  The
 
Statement of Mission of the National Endowment  for the Arts
 
reads  in part:
 
This nation's governance is based on our people's
 
commitment to freedom of imagination,  thought,  and
 
expression.  Our many aesthetic and cultural traditions
 
are precious to us -
 
for the rich variety of their
 
beauty and as a symbol of the diverse nature of the
 
United States.
 
To me,  this is a noble position.  It has not,  however,  been a
 
simple matter to put  into effect,  nor is  it  still.
 
The Arts Endowment  initially organized itself into
 
discipline-based programs which were to give give ancillary
 
financial  support to th ater,  dance,  visual arts,  opera,
 
music,  literature et al.  For example,  all forms of dance -
-
ballet,  hula,  tap,  modern,  gagaku  (bugaku),  moon-walking,
 
whatever -
-
 could theoretically receive grants of public
 
moneys from the Dance Program.  Intellectually and
 
C-'
 
emotionally,  this was an attractive concept to the tidy
 
bureaucratic mind -
-
 that each discipline should and would
 
support and celebrate  its own root traditions.  In actual
 
practice,  however,  in order to screen out  innumerable amateur
 
enthusiasts,  local commercial dance studios and the like,
 
Dance Program guidelines tended to require various
 
combinations of  lengthy performance seasons,  paid dancers,
 
specific budget or staff sizes,  etc.  unintentionally but
 
6
 
effectively ruling out of consideration all but the more well
 
organized professional dance troupes or training
 
institutions.
 
Clearly,  the very real problems of the American Ballet
 
c'
 
Theater wete  just not the  same as those of an Idaho American
 
Indian tribe wanting to revive its old Squash Dance that
 
nobody had done  for years  so that the essential and elaborate
 
costume regalia had to be remade at a serious expense in
 
labor and materials.  Nor were they the same as those of a
 
small Finnish-American community in the Michigan Upper
 
Peninsula whose only winterized dance  floor was  finally
 
collapsing after years and years of being polka-ed and
 
schottisched over by well-nourished Finnish couples.  These
 
events were simply of a different order than a ballet gala or
 
a choreographers workshop.  There was no way to compare or
 
contrast their significance or meaning;  it wasn't even a
 
question of trying to compare apples and oranges -
-
 more like
 
watermelons and sugarcane.
 
The Arts Endowment took a leisurely route towards
 
addressing these issues.  During the agency's  first twelve
 
years,  funding policies  for the major artistic disciplines
 
were set  in place and minority arts groups that had already
 
organized themselves  into the structures and procedures of
 
the professior al arts world were given their own special
 
funding category
 Occasional experimental dips  into that vast
 
other world of American artistic activities did occur,  but  it
 
was not until  1977 that a real niche was carved out for them
 
with the establishment of the Folk Arts Program with its own
 
guidelines,  its own policies,  its own budget.
 
I had the enormous good luck to be there throughout the
 
first  fifteen years of that program's adventure,  acting as
 
director,  first of a staff of one,  that  later ballooned into
 
a princely six.  The work began in an atmosphere of extreme
 
urgency.  The synthetic charms of mass culture were daily
 
drowning out the voices of less amplified and more
 
specialized cultures;  memories of the  sad and sudden demise
 
7
 
of the WPA kept  reminding us that unusual and experimental
 
programs,  especially those crossing class lines,  might not
 
survive very long;  and the  funds we had available  for our use
 
were extremely limited.  Every dollar had to tell.
 
Faced with a potentially enormous constituency,  we tried
 
from the  first to place our weak leverage where its impact
 
could be most  seriously felt.  In the process we developed
 
some politico/cultural strategies that may be of general
 
interest.  I shall have to summarize them unmercifully,  of
 
course,  and I ask your indulgence if they seem doctrinaire;
 
there is  little time to elaborate.
 
We were already committed by early definitions to a
 
multi-disciplinary approach -
-
 support of all community and
 
family artistic traditions whether musical,  visual,  or
 
literary.  This  improbable assignment was multiplied to the
 
nth degree by our intention to respond to the requests of all
 
the natiçn's  smaJ7l groups -
-
 ethnic,  religious,  occupational,
 
geographic.  It was a breath-taking responsibility,  and I
 
rather suspect the Folk Arts staff were the only ones who had
 
the  least notion how complicated and risky it was going to
 
be.  The Folk Arts  staff had no authorizing power;  we had to
 
win the approval of an inter-locking series of groups within
 
the Endowment  in order for a grant to go out.
 
There seemed no advantage,  though t in being mealy-
mouthed about the situation;  the Endowment was  just going to
 
have to cope with the existence of the Folk Arts Program head
 
on.  We began by behaving as though a policy of cultural
 
pluralism -
 a phrase coined by Alan Lomax -
 was already in
 
effect throughout the agency -
-
 and in a way,  because we said
 
so,  it was.  The conceptual ground rule was that the artistic
 
productions of every culture,  when practiced at their
 
aesthetic peak,  were as deserving of governmental  support as
 
any
 European-based fine art.  And it turned out to be very
 
awkward for Americans,  reared in a basically egalitarian
 
tradition,  to publicly counter this position,  even if they
 
didn't quite believe  it.
 
8
 
We began to elaborate.  Folk Arts projects would never be
 
spoken of in terms that  suggested they were either pathetic
 
or comical.  No matter how shambling,  oddly dressed,  or
 
socially unimpressive their practitioners,  they were to be
 
referred to respectfully as  "folk artists",  and what they
 
did,  from harmonica blowing to basket weaving,  was to be
 
called "art".  We elevated this rule by titling it  "framing",
 
an activity through which,  by placing a frame around a part
 
of the seamless web of human activity,  you give the enclosed
 
area a certain focus,  cachet,  importance.
 
The underlying goal of framing was to convince,  not  just
 
the Endowment,  but every local community we dealt with of the
 
value of their particular art forms.  Over and over we had
 
found local artists refusing to pass along their skills
 
claiming that  "nobody wants that old stuff anymore",  and
 
often enough they were right.  Charles  Seeger once pointed
 
out:
 
Gradual loss of the oldest  songs  in a repertory,  while
 
new materials are being added,  is a normal course of a
 
vigorous tradition,  But where the loss of the older
 
materials  is almost total and the new has little of
 
the nature of oral tradition and so is hard to
 
digest,  even the middle-aged materials may have gone by
 
the board and the very process of oral transmission
 
thwarted for lack of occasion for its cultivation.

Remember that we were working within a granting agency,
 
which means that our work was dependent upon outside
 
requests.  People had to come to us and say they wanted to do
 
thus and so;  we could not tell them what to do.  We could be
 
flirtatious and suggest that we would enjoy funding certain
 
types of projects,  but we had no muscle enabling us to order
 
such projects  into existence.
 
Among all our early problems,  the most  insistent was
 
how to limit our responsibilities.  We  just did not have
 
enough money to do very large projects and we did not want to
 
9
 
disappoint people by seeming to offer them the world and then
 
backing off.  Panelist and ethnomusicologist Fred Lieberman
 
gave us an important  strategic hint.  He remarked that we
 
might try to take an artistic event -
-
 say,  the preparation
 
of a tape documenting a shaped note hymn singing convention
 
or a residency by a local blues guitarist  in a Mississippi
 
rural public school -
-
 and break it down into the succession
 
of activities that had to happen to bring it about,  starting
 
as  far back as we could think,  even perhaps to the
 
composition of the particular music.  After the plot-line,  so
 
to say,  of each type of event had been established,  we could
 
then consider at which particular points along the historical
 
line,  outside money was useful or even desirable.  We had only
 
money to work with,  you see,  and money,  as  I have said many
 
times,  is,  culturally speaking,  a blunt  instrument.  It has
 
great power -
-
 but  it  can bash as well as build.
 
We settled on being simultaneously broadly inclusive and
 
tightly focussed.  We  first opened our funding categories to
 
any kind of legally eligible organization or artistic group,
 
inside or outside the culture,  but then we said they could
 
only spend our money on activities directly furthering the
 
music or art traditional to a particular group and their
 
senior artists.  We knew this to be a debatable policy -
-
 and
 
it was certainly debated -
-
 but we believed that the  job of
 
supporting the oldest  cultural forms and styles still extant
 
was one that only the Folk Arts Program would actually
 
undertake,  while worthy new emerging art  forms could often
 
find assistance elsewhere.  We also saw again and again that
 
small cultural groups without vigorous older traditions
 
lacked a strong sense of cultural identity.  They seemed
 
weakened and uncertain;  overall their situations seemed
 
especially precarious and urgent.  Finally,  with our limited
 
funds,  we believed that trying to get encouragement and local
 
expertise back to the communities where traditional artists
 
lived was a practical goal that might have wide-scale
 
effects.
 
f
.
 
10
 
In our broadly inclusionary working style,  we also took
 
in two areas that even we  felt were theoretically problematic
 
under a "folk art" program -
 -
 1)  arts traditional to the
 
tribes of North American Indians and 2)  the musical/dramatic
 
art  forms of the Asian royal courts that had been transported
 
to the United States  in the form of Chinese opera and the
 
like.  Both seemed to function within their own communities as
 
cultural  identifiers and reinforcers;  both,  because of their
 
unfamiliarity,  were ineffectively funded by the Endowment's
 
discipline programs.But  it kept on making us  feel
 
uncomfortable.  Eventually,  the appropriate solution seemed to
 
be to change our program's name rather than its constituency,
 
and so the the old Folk Arts Program was abandoned and the
 
Folk and Traditional Arts Program came  into being.
 
A final important  strategy I feel must be mentioned.  We
 
determined that all Folk Arts projects  should be as elegantly
 
produced and as historically accurate as possible  so that
 
everyone could be proud of the results.  We therefore required
 
the  inclusion in project budgets of production specialists
 
(e. g.  cinematographers,  sound engineers,)  as well as cultural
 
specialists.  Exactly who would fill these roles was left up
 
to the group doing the project.  They did the hiring;  the Folk
 
Arts Program
 occasionally offered advice as well as  lists
 
when needed of reputable and experienced scholars and
 
technicians,  especially those who could initiate  local
 
training programs.
 
Overall,  I am proud of what happened during my fifteen
 
years  service even though when I retired the programs'  budget
 
was  still no more than 2% of the Endowment's overall funds.
 
Most Americans  still think that European "fine" arts are
 
somehow finer than anybody else's  fine arts,  and I do not
 
know if that will ever change.  But the overall Folk Arts
 
budget did grow from a few hundred thousand to 4 million
 
during my tenure.  More importantly,  I do not think that the
 
United States can ever in future  set up a national arts
 
program which does not  include what most people are now
 
11
 
comfortable  in calling the  folk and traditional arts.  And
 
that  is 
a big change.  The American people now seem to
 
understand that there are other kinds of musics and other
 
4
 
kinds of people out there,  and that they must be  included.
 
When I first thought about doing this paper,  I had
 
intended to try to compare American policies  for supporting
 
their traditional musics with the cultural strategies of at
 
least a few other nations.

research;  It  is characteristic of what  I found that
 
in a book of 368 pages,  promisingly titled "The Patron State:
 
Government and the Arts  in Europe,  North America and Japan",
 
only one page even mentions any traditional art anywhere, and
 
that  shining exception details the governmental dollars
 
devoted to the Japanese national theater where Bunraku,
 
Kabuki and No performances are featured.  Apparently even in
 
Japan their own fine arts are  just a tad finer than their
 
other arts.

 example,  the
 
Canadian government,  which had led the way for the United
 
States  in the development of a modern arts  funding system,
 
sponsored during the  1970s and early 80s twin policies of
 
"cultural democratization" and "cultural democracy."
 
Democratization was a policy of heavily promoting and
 
diffusing high culture;  cultural democracy,  on the other
 
hand,  "sought to promote the self-expression of particular
 
sub-cultures." Equal value was put on any form of self-
expression -
-
 professional,  amateur,  or individual -
-
 the
 
process was to be emphasized rather than the result.
 Active
 
participation was the overall goal.
 
12
 
By the end of the 80's both principles had,  as various
 
Canadian commentators expressed it,  "fizzled out";
 
democratization ran up against the fact that the values of
 
high culture were both expensive and not of prime interest to
 
all Canadians.  The notion of cultural democracy collapsed
 
because extending equal significance to every expression by
 
every individual resulted eventually in mass boredom.
 
However,  the campaign did set  in place and familiarize the
 
Canadian people with the structure of provincial and national
 
arts councils that provide grants to individual artists
 
as well as to arts organizations.  Within this context,
 
traditional artists e
I be funded either by applying
 
through an ethnic organization or individually.  Indigenous
 
Native Canadian artists,  traditional or avant garde,  we-re not
 
generally considered for Arts Council funding since there
 
separate federal and provincial budgets  for Canadian
 
Indian affairs.

A second approach has been taken by
 
a more arms-length
 
many so-called
 
"third world" nations,  especially those of the former Soviet
 
Union and central and eastern Europe.  A major part of this
 
strategy has been to support and present their own particular
 
traditional arts as public icons-- representative of the
 
regional or national ethos,  the  spirit of the people--
13
 
before the widest possible audiences.  In pursuit of this
 
goal,  special local and regional  schools have been developed
 
where senior traditional artists  instruct talented young
 
hopefuls.  Professional national companies tour internally and
 
around the world,  presenting exciting and dramatic
 
interpretations of local cultural traditions.  In an era of
 
mass communication,  the sheer accessibility of this approach

because of our experience with the devouring national popular

the older,  quieter,  not -ever-ready-for-prime-time artists
 
unheard.  Not every music is appropriate for the big stage and
 
the mass audience,  and yet they may feed that  stage in ways
 
we do not  recognize as clearly as we see the influences that
 
led to the development of  jazz,  country music and rhythm and
 
blues.

My friends,  I have taken up a great deal of your time
 
and patience to raise and discuss problems that you may not
 
have known that you had -
-
 how your own government supports
 
or does not  support or even quite possibly unintentionally
 
attacks the traditional musics that are hanging on in your
 
own country.  Trying to preserve cultural diversity is a
 
relatively new idea.  The world became concerned about the
 
destruction of the natural environment  far earlier than it
 
began to worry about the destruction of its cultural
 
resources.  Indeed,  when I started at the Arts Endowment  I
 
remember thinking that  since human beings as they spread over
 
the planet had become  so efficient  in wiping out differing
 
cultures along with their arts,  all I had to do was  just the
 
opposite.  It made it all seem a bit more manageable.  Whatever
 
it was they didn't do,  I would do it,  and the other way round
 
as well.  (My Folk Arts colleagues have expressed this thought
 
more formally
 -
-
 "All we had to do was to reverse the
 
overall process,  in effect getting the prevailin2 cultural
 
I
 
tide to flow the opposite direction.")
 
But we have to be more sophisticated than that now.  We
 
have to start directing our serious thinking not  just to the
 
recording and replication of the old styles or to the latest
 
attempts to catch the popular music brass ring,  but to the
 
continuance of the local musics as potential creative
 
engines,  producing works suitable for those  folks who live
 
over here as 1

 to those  folks who live over there.  At
 
conferences  such as this we may be able,  if we choose to face
 
this great humanitarian task,  to develop long-range
 
strategies that will help our world of multiple  sounds  last
 
far beyond our own years -
 and ears.
