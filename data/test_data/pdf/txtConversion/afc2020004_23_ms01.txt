IN THE FIELD 
 
In the field 
on the Poet’s 
visions of earth that began 
their machine romance 
our dreams epidemic hearts beat 
fueled a little faster. 
where in the fossils world they’re released  
 
On a rainy winter day 
you dream 
of a sense of dislocation 
murmuring 
secrets of wind like rivers through murky waters—tinted  
tealike by 
the mangroves 
 
The way you described Geographica Power of Light 
archivists of flame 
at home among 
Silvery ghosts at twilight, 
Swim in circles, bump one another, turn, and fly the other way. 
 
Stand still, 
Watch rattled windows captures the plume 
twenty miles away 
 
Transformed its snow into Night Salt 
  
 
One language 
humming the words 
down from the summer 
the sprawling river are glorious 
color and the season 
the vibrancy of the apricot 
silhouetted against trees on the surface. Beneath 
palette are reflected in the singular 
have a textural sensibility 
 
Fires burning 
Think of the fall without your interior world 
Remembering this gift from the stars 
Grows in the sun and mirrored 
Surfaces were everywhere 
Where form word is “topography” 
 
 
 
 
  
 
Ghostly in the gaunt 
Shadows on wheat fields 
Dwarfed splendor 
Architects of the graffiti of isolation 
A grist 
Glacial calling Incandescent 
Fastness of the Frozen archive of 
Resonance 
Climatic and mysterious 
The secret of our Quiet 
Oasis in the stone 
Rises mushroom in the old 
Names of rivers— 
1,500 years of winter in the 
Heart 
Minimal lights, that mumbles saffron 
Dwellers 
And breathe in the ephemeral 
Hungry for a thousand years 
 
 
  
 
Felt 
House in mind put on this earth 
Surrounded by darkness, 
bayous of 
bone or teeth are exposed, 
(185 miles) north of 
Witness 
Articulate speech 
tumbling down 
as a cloth 
unwinding marionette lines 
protecting 
eyes of the weird 
pushes out of reservoir 
far as the door 
indeed 
mysteries do lie 
alone as the most 
of the unknown. Quickly hardened

pied territories 
of the morning trench

Dark purple

Days of sieving Sea Smoke 
The balance is harmonious 
Where we stood went 
Glories of the crow’s feet 
Still absent were coarse salt 
Fine lines 
of tobacco and a dab of burnt apricot 
blue with accents 
of the tea paper on the ceiling of the earliest higher

abducted grasping

Hence the reasoning 
 
 
  
 
Peering into landscapes in motion are common lunettes with foliate filling

scree riding a submerged ice core 
and thus winter

In the left ear a silver-colored falconry glove
