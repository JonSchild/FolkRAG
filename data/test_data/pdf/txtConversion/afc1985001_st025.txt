East Virginia Blues
EAST VIRGINIA BLUES 5123 A1
Wayne Dinwiddie Visalia, 1941
I was born in Last Virginia To North Carolina I did go Fell in love with a fair young maiden
But her name I did not know.
Now her hair were dark and curly And her cheeks were rosy red And on her breast she
wore white lilies Where I longed to lay my head.
In my heart you are my darling At my door yore welcome in At my gate I'll always greet you
Yore the girl I tried to win.
Now I'd rather be in some dark hollow Where the sun don't ever shine Than for you to be
another man's darlin' When I know you'll never be mine.
