"SPECULATION " 
is the theme 
That every soul arouses ; 
'Tis the maiden's artless dream, 
W ho sighs for love and houses ! 
" 
Speculation " never stops 
When once we all beoin it; 
Land, or gold, or flour, or hops— 
W hy, " 
There's millions in it !" 
SPOEEN.—Yes, it don't make any difference—for instance— 
" 
Hogs !" Why, here's a 
fortune there ! 
Any one may win it; 
"Corn 1" its wealth I 
can't compare--
Why, " There's millions in it !" 
" 
Fitz Auo-ustus " is a 
youth 
Whose noddle is the lightest ; 
Comes along the widow " Truth," 
With eyes that are the brightest ; 
Now h-r 
dimes are on the wane, 
His fortune, she must win it; 
" 
Speculation " is her game— 
Why, ‘• There's millions in it !" 
SPOSEN.—Dear little charmer, so unsophisticated— 
" 
Hogs !" 
So the world is wao-cring on, 
And will he till it ceases ; 
All lrive " speculative " grown, 
And want the weal h 
of C-oesus. 
Old and youn ,, their fortune see, 
And struggle on to win it; 
Each pet schmle they all a,ree— 
Why, " There's millions in it !" 
SPOICEN.—" Mules," or " Eyewash," or— 
etc. 
" 
Hogs!" etc.

No matter where you journey, 
Some " motto '' strikes the eye; 
'Tis well to think upon it, 
And to use it bye and by, 
When you set out on your race, my boys, 
Jog along until you win it; 
Do a 
good turn always while you may— 
You'll find there's millions in it. 
Then a 
cheer for every honest heart; 
May a 
blessing fall each minute 
On a 
worthy deed to a 
soul in need— 1 
Oh, you'll find there's millions in it. 
Don't frown when days are gloomy, 
Brace up to meet the stortn, 
For winter soon will vanish, 
And summer days grow warm; 
With a 
smile of joy for every one, 
Oh, the heart sings like a 
linnet; 
Tho' a 
kind word never costs a 
cent, 
Why, you'll find there's millions in it. 
Then a 
cheer, etc. 
When bright eyes smile upon you, 
And love lights up your heart, 
Don't linger dumb and bashful 
Till the chance to speak depart ; 
When you find a 
heart that is worth the while, 
Persevere until you win it ; 
Speak your mind for an honest woman's love— 
Oh, my boys, there's millions in it. 
Then a 
cheer, etc. 
Go help your fallen brother 
When he's trodden in the dust ; 
Although he proves ungrateful, 
hell) him up the hill " on trust." 
He may one day shine out like a 
star; 
If you've done no good, begin it; 
Oh, an easy conscience, that's the thing— 
Why, you'll find there's millions in it. 
Then a 
cheer, etc. 
This " motto " then remember 
In work, and love, and life; 
Go put your shoulder to the wheel, 
And overcome each strife, 
For a 
happy heart that sings all day, 
You every one may win it; 
Oh, it's worth a 
world of gems and go!d, 
And there's countless millions in it. 
Then a 
cheer, etc.

And we love each other all the time 
More than all the world beside.

Each night as you pass by, 
Will favor us with an early call,

I 
will love you just the same 
As the day I 
took your name. 
Yes, our locks may lose their gold, 
And our faces, too, grow old, 
But our hearts will be the same— 
Naught can dim love's holy flame.

Side by side, through storm and strife; 
Still together, hand- in- hand, 
Seek we now another land.

By the shining gates of gold, 
Where our faces ne'er grow old.

POPPING CORN. 
AND there they sat a-popping corn, John Stiles and Susan Cut-

John Stiles as fat as any ox. and Susan fat as butter ; 
And there they sat and shelled the corn, and raked and stirred 
the fire, 
And talked of different kind of ears, and hitched their chairs up 
nigher.

Then Susan she the hopper shook, then John he shook the pop-

Till both their faces grew as red as saucepans made of copper,

Five thousand miles von home.

Und I

I DREAM OF HOME. 
I DREAM Of my home, happy home of my childhood, 
Where life's sunny morning passed sweetly away; 
I 
dream of the cot that stood by the wildwood, 
Around which the young birds sang sweet all the day. 
cnoaus. 
Father, of you; 
Mother, of you, 
Sisters, brothers, all, 
I 
dream of you. 
In slumber I 
hear happy voices still singing, 
Echoed o'er valley and hill far away ; 
I 
hear from yon green the old church bell now ringing, 
To which all the children are hastening away. 
Father, of you, etc. 
Oh! sad was the hour when, my bright home forsaking, 
I 
roamed amid strangers cold-hearted and vain; 
But now I 
am weary; my poor heart is breaking; 
Then take me, oh I 
take me to my dear home again. 
Father, of you, etc. 
CALL ME PET NAMES. 
CALL me pet names, dearest—call me a 
bird, 
That flies to thy breast at one cherished word ; 
That folds its wild wings there, ne'er thinking of flight; 
That tenderly sings there in loving delight. 
0, my sad heart is pining for one fond word! 
Call me pet names, dearest—call me thy bird. 
Call me fond names, dearest—call me a 
star, 
Whose smiles, beaming welcome thou feelest from afar; 
Whose light is the clearest, the truest to thee, 
When the night-time of sorrow steals over life's sea. 
0, trust thy rich bark where its warm rays are! 
Call me pet names, darling—call we thy star. 
Call me sweet names, darling— call me a 
flower, 
That lives in the light of thy smile each hour ; 
That droops when its heaven, thy love, grows cold ; 
That shrinks from the wicked, the false, and bold ; 
That blooms for thee only through sunlight and shower I. 
Call me pet names, darling—call me thy flower. 
Call me dear names, darling—call me thine own.; 
Speak to me always in love's low tone; 
Let not thy looks nor thy voice grow cold; 
Let my fond worship thy being enfold ; 
Love me forever, and love me alone; 
Call me pet names, darling—call me thine own.

GENTLE jENNIE GRAY. 
MY 
heart is sad, I'll tell you why, 
if you'll listen to my lay, 
Which makes me weep when I 
sing, 
Of my gentle Jennie Gray. 
But I 
never can forget the days 
When with Jennie by my side, 
We talked of love and happiness, 
When she should be my bride. 
ClIORUS. 
Hush the banjo, toll the knell, 
I'm very sad to-day ; 
I 
cannot work, so let me weep 
For my gentle Jennie Gray. 
My Jennie had the sweetest face, 
And eyes of sparkling jet ; 
With lips like new born roses, 
She was my darling pet ; 
But death he called one morning 
And took my love away, 
And left me lonely weeping 
For my gentle Jennie Gray. 
Hush the banjo, etc. 
And in the ground they laid her, 
Close by my cabin door ; 
A rude stone marks the spot 
Where she sleeps to wake no more ; 
While at her grave I'm weeping 
At every close of day, 
I 
fancy then she's sleeping, 
And not dead! my Jennie Gray. 
Hush the banjo ; etc. 
SOMETHING TO LOVE ME. 
Somr:ruiscr to love me, something to bless, 
Something to smile upon and to caress ; 
Something to fill up the void in my heart, 
That will not when sorrow comes o'er me, depart. 
Something that loves not as summer friends love 
As true as the star in the blue realms above ; 
Something with instinct enough to believe, 
That will not, like most of earth's proud ones, deceive. 
Something to love me, something to bless, 
Something, to smile upon and to caress ; 
Something to fill up the void in my heart, 
That will not, when sorrow comes o'er me, depart. 
Something to love me, something to pet, 
Something that kindness can never forctet ; 
Something that clings to me, even a 
bird, 
in whose sweet music reproach is not heard. 
Something to cheer me, and stay by my side, 
That never will leave me whate'er may betide, 
That I 
may still in this hollow world find 
There's something still left to be loving and kind. 
Something to love me, something to bless, 
Something to smite upon and to caress , 
Something to fill up the void in my heart, 
That will not, when sorrow comes o'er me, depart. 
THE AMERICAN BANNER. 
FLING it out to the breeze, spread abroad every fold, 
For on it inscribed are the deeds of the brave ; 
Let nations oppressed all its beauties behold, 
As it gleams from our mountains, and floats o'er each wave. 
The Red, White and Blue—what is fairer to see, 
Than the banner inscribed with the deeds of the free '1 
Flinn- abroad the bright banner—a 
new constellation, 
Of stars are revealing the incoming day, 
When freedom shall be as a 
sun to each nation, 
And wrong and oppression will no more have sway. 
The Red, White, and Blue—What is fairer to see, 
Than the banner that heralds the deeds of the free 
The deeds of the brave ! ay, rightly upon 
Our banner is written a story sublime ; 
How the rich blood of heroes a 
legacy won, 
Which shall e'er endure through the annals of Time. 
The Red, White, and Blue—what is fairer to see, 
Than the banner that guards both the brave and the free I

ONLY a 
tress of hair 
lie had stolen one morning bright; 
But the old man dash'd from his cheek a 
tear, 
And murnmr'd a 
name to him so dear, 
As he kiss'd it, and gazed through the night ! 
" 
Canst thou see me, my darling," he cried 
From thy home with the angels now, 
As I 
watch, where so oft by my side 
Thou hast smiled on- me years ago 7 
Thou has smiled on me years ago 7 
I'm sad and lone now thou art gone, 
And oft is my heart like to break, 
Since from beav'n they came my angel to claim, 
And left mo to weep and wake 
But 0 
1 ' twill be sweet when yonder we meet; 
Till then, love, good night—good night." 
Only a 
wither'd flow'r 
She had worn ' mong her ringlets bright, 
But the old man tenderly laid it by 
With the tress he cherish'd, with many a 
sigh, 
And again looked far through the night ! 
' 
Hark !" he whispered, " a 
voice I 
hear 
Through the wind it murmurs low, 
And creeps to my heart so near, 
As a 
voice did years ago, 
As a 
voice did years ago ! 
'Tis thine, my love, it woos me above, 
To thy home where the weary rest, 
And I 
patiently wait till at heav'n's bright gate,

shall see thee ' mong angels blest 1 
And 01 ' twill be sweet when yonder we meet;

Music by ARTHUR S. 
SULLIVAN.. 
I 
IIPARD a 
voice long years ago, 
A 
voice so wondrous sweet and low, 
That trembling tears unbidden rose 
From the depth's of love's repose; 
It floated through my dreams at night, 
And made the darkest day seem bright; 
It whisper'd to my heart, " My love," 
And nestling there, forgot to rove. 
O 
my love, I 
lov'd her so ; 
My love that lov'd me years ago ; 
O 
my love, 0 
my love, 
O 
my love, I 
lov'd her so— 
My love that lov'd me years ago. 
But ere our summer pass'd away, 
That gentle voice was hush'd for aye; 
I 
watcli'd my love's last smile, and knew 
how well the angels lov'd her too ; 
Then silent, but with blinding tears, 
I 
gather.d 
all the love of years, 
And laid it with my dream of old, 
Where all I 
lov'd slept white and cold. 
O 
my love, I 
lov'd her so— 
My love that lov'd me years ago! 
O

LINGER NOT LONG. 
LrsoEn not long, linger not long, 
home is not home without thee; 
Its dearest tokens only make me mourn, 
Oh, let its mem'ry, like a 
chain about thee, 
Gently compel and hasten thy return ; 
Linger not long, linger not long. 
Linger not long, linger not long; 
How shall I 
watch thy coming 
As evening shadows stretch o'er moor and fell, 
When the wild bee bath ceased her weary humming, 
And silence hangs on all things like a 
spell 
Linger not long, linger not long. 
How shall I 
watch, how shall I 
watch 
For thee when fear grows stronger, 
As night grows dark and darker o'er the hill 7 
How shall I 
weep when I 
can watch no longer 7 
Oh, art thou absent, art thou absent still 7 
Linger not long, linger not long. 
Haste, haste thee home, haste, haste thee home, 
Unto thy mountain dwelling; 
Haste as a 
bird unto its peaceful nest— 
Haste as a 
skiff, when tempests wild are swelling, 
Flies to its haven of securer rest; 
Linger not long, linger not long.

LITTLE ANNIE LOWRY. 
Written by Winnum D ELEHAN TT. 
On! good- evening, gentle white folks, 
I'm glad to have a 
chance, 
For to come before the right folks, 
And sing a 
song and dance, 
If you listen to my story, 
I 
won't detain you long, 
It's about Miss Annie Lowry, 
The subject of my song. 
CHORUS 
The fairest flower that grows. 
The rarest, reddest rose, 
The lily or the daisy, 
The primrose of the dell, 
With Annie can't compare, 
She is so sweet and fair. 
Oh, my little Annie Lowry, 
My sunbeam, beauty ., 
belle. 
Oh, my little Annie Lowry, 
So blithesome and so gay ; 
If they should take you from me, 
I 
wouldn't live a 
day. 
Lord bless the day I 
met you, 
The maddest, merriest hour, 
And bless my hope to get you, 
, My sunbeam, and my flower. 
The fairest flower, etc. 
how deep in love I 
fell, 
There's none on earth can tell ; 
None but the Power above me, 
Knows that I 
love so well. 
Sweet golden days of life, 
When I 
can call you wife ; 
01, my little Annie Lowry, 
My sunbeam, beauty, belle. 
The fairest flower, etc. 
Thrice welcome, lovely springtime, 
Awl darling month of May ; 
Ye merry birds that make rhyme, 
Throughout the livelong day. 
Come forth, entrancing beauty, 
And glorify the earth ; 
And guard her path of roses, 
Prove Annie's wealth of worth. 
The fairest flower, etc.

LITTLE ANNIE LO WRY.—Continued. 
Oh, golden day of days, 
Oh, heart that never sways ; 
Oh, Annie, queen of beauty, 
The one I 
love so well. 
I 
asked her shall we wed 
To which she sweetly said ; 
I 
feel it much my duty, 
We shall, of course, we shall. 
The fairest flower, etc. 
DANCING ON THE LEVEE. 
I 
WAS dancing on the levee, - 
While the steamboat whistle Mowed, 
The captain was a 
calling, 
For us nigs and all the crew, 
Of course we obeyed orders, 
And on the boat went, 
And down the Ohio river, 
What a 
lovely time we spent. 
Indeed, indeed, I 
did, 
Indeed, indeed, I 
did. 
Indeed, indeed, I 
did, 
Double deed, 
Indeed, indeed I 
did. 
Of all the nigs in the land, 
What sails the Mississippi, 
you'll never find a 
happier nig than Joe. 
When we arrived in Tennessee, 
We throwed a 
gan ,, plank out, 
And when we got the freight ashore, 
The mokes commenced to shout ; 
The captain told us get the banjo, 
And we all could sing ; 
And when they play'd our favorite, 
We cut the pigeon wing. 
Indeed, indeed, etc,

Since de safe ole times when dis nigger was young. 
In de days I 
was young, nigger's wool didn't harp high, 
Poultry sold cheap and chickens wasn't shan high ; 
Young folks went to meetin' an' didn't go to musses, 
And folks went into honainy instead of homnybusses.

" 
Tom Collins" has insulted me, and must apologize, 
They say he talks about me in a

despise ; 
The other day I

friend and heard the worst of news, 
He told me, if I 
didn't mind, my lovely wife I'd lose I

Along with quite a

In one place, for the twentieth time, I 
call'd, and was kick'd 
out; 
No satisfaction can I

And never give way to despair, ha! ha !— Olio. 
No matter whatever you suffer, 
Somebody else suffers too, 
There's comfort in this little motto, 
"Soznebody's worse off than you;" 
Don't envy the rich, it's a

LINGERING NEAR THE DOOR. 
Words and Muric by FDANK VAN HESS. 
LINGERING near the door, 
How the moments fly! 
Joy o.er happy dreams, 
Fleeting, leaves a 
sigh. 
Twilight hour is past— 
Shadows lengthening still, 
Heart to heart responds, 
Love each breast cloth fill. 
cnoaus. 
Lingering near, lingering near, 
Lingering near the door, 
How the moments fly— 
Lingering near the door. 
Lingering near the door— 
Vision ever bright, 
Rosy morn appears 
With its flushing light. 
Sadly DOW we leave— 
Day dreams are before, 
Metn'ry'll fondly dwells, 
Lingering near the door. 
Lingering near, etc. 
THE PIC-NIC PARTY. 
OF 
all tbe pleasures on this earth, 
For fun and frolic, joy and mirth, 
Laughing, riding, walking, talking,, 
Give me a 
pic-nic party. 
Girls so pretty, men so witty, 
Rushing from the crowded city. 
List, I 
pray, to this my ditty, 
About the pic-nic party ; 
So lets be merry and contrive 
How to keep the game alive, 
On fun and frolic let us thr:ve 
At this our pie-inc party. 
Now there's the dinner on the grass, 
The spread, the knives and ferks, and g%ss, 
With pigeon pies and joints en masse, 
To feed the pic-nic party. 
'Tis true they leave the salt behind, 
The cork'crew they can never find, 
But to complain ' tweul I 
be unkind, 
So evervho ly says ' Never mind 
Now all are seated— they begin, 
When shrieks are heard—a 
horrid din, 
For a 
nest of ants they're sitting in; 
Oh, the joys of a 
pic-nic party. 
THINKING OF HOKE. 
M ANY a 
night on the silent deck 
Have I 
gaged on the stars above; 
As I 
looked abroad on the tranquil sea, 
My heart was filled with love. 
Thinking of home and the dear ones there, 
Have I 
felt the tear- drops flow, 
Breathing in silence a 
fervent prayer 
For the friends of long ago, 
CUORIIS. 
Many a 
night, many a 
right, 
Thinking of home; 
Many a 
night, yes, may 
8. night, 
Thinking, thinking of home. 
Father, and mother, and sister dear, 
Come to me in my waking dreams; 
And I 
hear a 
voice and I 
see a 
face 
That to me like an angel seems. 
But did I 
not give her my parting vow, 
As she owned her love for me'? 
Visions of beauty hear me now; 
Thus I 
sigh on the deep blue sea. 
Many a 
night, etc. 
Proudly let the Star Spangled Banner wave 
Wherever the salt seas flow, 
In a 
foreign land, wherever it be, 
Our sons will gladly go, 
Doing and daring beneath that flag 
All that men e'er do or dare, 
Who, thinking of fame, have left their home 
For the sake of the fond hearts there. 
Many a 
night, etc.

DON'T forget the old folks—

Near the shining shore.

Don't forget dear father, 
With his failing sight, 
And his locks once thick and brown, 
Scanty now, and white. 
Though he may be childish, 
Still do you be kind; 
Think of him as years ago 
With his " master-mind.' 
Don't forget the old folks, 
Love them more and more

They have known below. 
Don't forget sweet mother, 
With her furrow'd brow, 
Once as fair, and smooth, and white 
As the driven snow; 
Are her steps uncertain 7 
Is her hearing poor 7 
Guide her gently till she stands 
Safe at heaven's door.

Arranged by R. STErnLy. 
The Music of this song is published by E H III.11,DING, 288 Bowery, New 
York. 
Price 10 cents. 
IN 
the lonely night she rambled on, 
A 
stranger ev'ry where ; 
While the moaning wind and the silent snow 
Play'd with her golden hair ! 
There was light unwise in the heavenly eyes, 
And a 
shadow round her stnil'd ; 
'Twas a 
dream of death like an angel's breath, 
To the lonely orphan child. 
CHORUS. 
Poor little lonely orphan child, 
Creeping along with face so mild ; 
The cold wind cries, and the echo replies, 
Poor little lonely orphan child. 
She is old in grief, though young in years, 
Her friends are far away ; 
Where the days were bright, and her heart was light, 
In happy childhood's play. 
Now she wanders by with a 
cold heart- sigh, 
And her sweat lips part in prayer : 
" 
Oh, that I 
might dwell in that darksmne sky, 
Sweet angel, guide me there!" 
Poor little, etc. 
As the lonely night more lonely grew, 
She wept with cold and pain ; 
And the long lost, home in her youth she Ituew, 
Now seetn'd in sight aaain. 
Heaven heard her pray'r, as she trembrd there, 
And her sorrow soon was fled ; 
And the watchman found on he snow-clad ground. 
The outcast orphan dead. 
Poor little, etc. 
POP GOES THE WEASEL. 
THE painter works with ladder and brush, 
The artist with the easel, 
The fiddler always snaps the string 
At pop goes the weasel. 
CHORUS. 
From round about the countryman's barn, 
The mice beain to rnizzle ; 
For when they poke their noses out, 
Pop goes the weasel. 
The butcher. when he charges for meat, 
Sticks in the bone and gristle, 
But that's the way the money goes, 
And pop goes the weasel. 
From round about, etc. 
Potatoes for an Irishman's taste, 
A 
doctor for the measles, 
A 
fiddler always for a 
dance, 
Or pop goes the weasel. 
From around about, etc. 
Blood- pudding for a 
Dutchman's meal, 
A workman for a 
chisel, 
The tune that everybody sings 
Is pop goes the weasel. 
From round about, etc. 
JESSIE, THE FLOWER OF DUMBLANE. 
THE sun has gane down o'er the lofty Ben Lomond, 
And left the red clouds to preside o'er the scene ; 
While lanely I 
stray in a 
calm simmer gloaming, 
To muse on sweet Jessie, the flow'r o' Dumblane. 
How sweet is the brier, wi' its saft fauldin;.; blossom, 
And sweet is the birck wi' its mantle o' green, 
Yet sweeter and fairer, and dear to this bosom, 
Is lovely young Jessie, the flow'r o' Dumblane. 
She's modest as ony, and blithe as she's bonny, 
For Lwileless nimplicity marks her its am, 
And far be the villain divested o' reennci, 
Wa'd blight in its bloom the sweet flow'r of Dumblaic. 
Sing on, thou sweet Mavis, thy hymns to the evening, 
Thou'rt dear to the echoes o' Calderwood Gen ; 
Sae dear to this bosom, sae artless and wirniinrr, 
Is charming young Jessie, the flow'r of Dumblane. 
How lost were my days, ' till I 
met wi' my .1e.s•sie, 
The sports o' the city seem'd foolish and vain ; 
I 
ne'er saw a 
nymph I 
would ca' my dear lassie, 
'Till eharm'd wi' sweet Jessie, the flow'r of Dumblane.

On! Lillie dear, it grieves me, 
The tale I 
have to tell; 
Old massa sent me roaming, 
S..), Lillie, fare you well! 
Oh ! fare you well, my true love, 
Farewell, old Tennessee ; 
Then let me weep for you, love, 
But do nut weep for me. 
Farewell forever to old Tennessee; 
Farewell, my Lillie dear—don't weep for me. 
I's going to roam the wide world, 
In lands I've never hoed, 
With nothing but my banjo 
To cheer me on the road; 
And when I'm sad and weary, 
I'll make the banjo play, 
To ' mind me of my true love 
When I 
am far away. 
Farewell forever, etc. 
I 
wake up in the morning, 
And walk out on the farm; 
Oh! Lillie am a

Down by the river side; 
I 
tell her that I 
love her, 
And he must be my bride. 
Farewell forever, etc. 
Oh ! Lillie dear, ' tis mournful 
To leave you here alone; 
You'll smile before I 
leave you, 
And weep when I 
am gone; 
The sun can never shine, love, 
So bright for you and me, 
As when I 
worked beside you 
In good old Tennessee. 
Farewell forever; etc.

IP 
Mr parents are wealthy and live in style 
in a 
mansion of their own ; 
They dote upon me, and if faults they see 
They will never make them known. 
Some chide me and say in a 
gentle way, 
" 
You must change your careless ways ;" 
But it ne'er can be done, for while life is mine, 
I'm the boy that's hound to blaze. 
Bound to blaze, bound to blaze, bound to blaze. 
cnonus. 
I'm the boy that's bound to blaze; 
While I'm living I 
must be gay; 
My pa is rich, and my ma don't care, 
And Pm bound to blaze away. 
They say I'm so naughty ! the girls I 
mean, 
But they only speak in fun ; 
They know what a 
man of the world I'm am, 
And the hearts I've lost and won. 
I'll do as I 
please, understand, my boys ; 
Let the world give scorn or praise ; 
For evil or good I 
will he a 
blood— 
I'm the boy that's bound to blaze. 
I'm the boy, etc. 
I 
know all the sports, and the sports know me, 
And I'm welcomed everywhere; 
I 
handle the " ribbons " so wild and free 
All the people stop and stare. 
I 
drive thro' the Park when the day is bright, 
With my pair of shining bays ; 
Sensation is ever my heart's delight, 
And I'm always bound to blaze. 
I'm the boy, etc. 
I 
go to the races and bet my pile, 
Win or lose, it's all the same, 
For when you're in Rome you must feel at home, 
Never mind the future blame. 
Sometimes I 
awake with a 
great headache, 
And my fancy backwards strays ; 
No matter," 1 
say ; " this is just the way 
When a 
fellow's bound to blaze." 
I'm the boy, etc.

GOOD-BYE, DARLING, I MUST LEAVE YOU. 
Sung with great success by the late EDDIE NOLWOOD. 
On, I love a 
charming girl, 
And to her I 
never shall 
Say or do anything that's wrong; 
Now ' tis my great delight 
To bring her here each night, 
Just to hear a 
quiet little song. 
CHORUS. 
Good-bye, darling, I 
must leave you"; 
One more kiss before I 
go; 
I'll be here to-morrow night; 
If I

Just a 
word or two to let my darling know. 
Of all the girls that is, 
There is none like pretty Liz, 
For she's the lovely girl that stole my heart ; 
Now I 
don't wish to boast, 
But what grieves the chaps the most 
Is when of a 
night from her I 
have to part. 
Good-bye, darling, etc. 
She's a 
charming girl I'm sure, 
And when I 
meet her at the door, 
On her lips I'm sure to imprint a 
kiss ; 
She has such a 
slender waist, 
Rosy cheeks and pretty face, 
She's too good I 
think for a 
world like this. 
Good-bye, darling, etc 
Now when I 
meet my Liz to-night, 
I 
think I'll make it right, 
And ask her just to be my little wife ; 
Oh, sha'n't I 
feel so gay 
When she names the happy day ? 
Of course it will end all my cares and strife. 
SPOKEN.— Ah, my dear boys, I 
sha'n't have to say then— 
Good-bye, darling, etc,

REPLY TO " ROCK ME TO SLEEP, MOTHER." 
Wny is your forehead deep furrowed with care ? 
What has so soon mingled frost in your hair ? 
Why are you sorrowful, why do you weep 'I 
Why do you ask me to " rock you to sleep 7" 
Could you but see through this world's vale of tears, 
Light would your sorrows he, harmless your fears ; 
All that seems darkness to you would be light— 
All would be sunshine where now is but night. 
CHORUS. 
Follow me cheerfully, pray do not weep ; 
In spirit I'll soothe you and " rock you to sleep." 
Why would you backward with Time again turn 7 
Why do you still for your childhood's days yearn 7 
Weary one, why through the past again roam, 
While in the future the path leads you home 7 
Oh, dearest child, dry those tears! weep no more-
Call me not back from the " echoless shore." 
Follow me cheerfully, pray do not weep ; 
In spirit I'll soothe you, and " rock you to sleep." 
Follow me cheerfully etc.

I 
RATE no home, I 
have no home, 
I 
have no happy home; 
I'm left alone, a

And dwelt within a 
tidy cot, 
And never knew a 
fear. ,

I

Then chide me not; turn not aside 
My prayer I 
beg you hear. 
The little cot that gave me birth, 
The smiles of parents kind, 
The birds so gay, the flowers so sweet, 
All throng upon my mind ; 
My heart is full of grief and woe, 
My tears suffuse my eyes, 
When I 
recall to mern'ry dear 
Loved ones in yon bright skies. 
I 
have no home, etc. 
A 
father dear, whose care I 
miss, 
A 
mother full of love, 
Who taught me when I 
scarce could lisp. 
To trust in Him above; 
They've left this earth ; I'm here alone; 
There's none to cairn my fears; 
Kind friend, I 
beg thy hand extend, 
And wipe away my tears.

As sung by Gus W I/AAA:us. 
On! I 
am a 
bad luck Dutchman, 
And I'd have you all to know, 
I 
arrived in town the other day, 
From the State of Ohio. 
I 
went me down to the Battery, 
A 
bully place I 
took to see the grand procession, 
That was waiting for the Duke. 
Waiting for the Duke, waiting for the Duke, 
I 
tell you bow they smashed my hat, 
My pocket- book some one took that, 
While waiting for the Duke, waiting, for the Duke, 
0, gracious, how them fellows did go through me. 
I 
turn around and seized a 
man, 
Who said you Dutch gallout,ei 
Cheese it, Cully, swipes his nibs, 
He mashed me in the snout. 
A 
policeman he seized hold, and thus he rebuke, 
He took me to the station house, 
And I 
never seen the Duke. 
Waiting for the Duke, etc. 
Oh, when I 
found my watch was gone, 
thoualit that I 
would drop ; 
Althouoh that a 
nice stout watch, 
With me it did not stop. 
Police I 
cried with all my miaht, 
But they no notice of me took ; 
I 
found the police like all the rest, 
Was waiting for the Duke. 
Waiting for the Duke, etc.

WHEN A MAN'S MARRIED. 
, 
Sung by Tom BARRY. 
W HEN a 
man first appears in maturity's years, 
To encounter the troubles of life, 
He thinks with delight he could make himself right, 
Could he only get hold of a 
wife ; 
He'll sigh and he'll press, she will answer him " yes," 
He's married he thinks to a 
queen ; 
But the honeymoon o'er he feels rather sore, 
And says " what a 
sardine I 
have been." 
CHORUS. 
A man that is wed to a 
wife that is queer, 
Had better be plagued with a 
bug in his ear. 
At their first falling out she'll sigh, fret and pout, 
And say to her ma she will go ; 
For she knows that her mother will tell her brother, 
And send down his big brother Joe ; 
If at night he's out late her passion is great, 
lie is cruel and wicked she'll say ; 
When she was at home her time was her own, 
And Pa 
Jet her have her own way. 
A man that is .wed, etc. 
But before my song's done I'll rub off as I 
run, 
I 
don't mean the dear creatures to vex; 
It was but a 
joke every word that I 
spoke, 
For bless them, I 
love all the sex. 
So men take my advice, get wed in a 
trice, 
And of marriage be not afraid, 
And girls do the same, go change your name, 
For its shocking to die an old maid. 
CHOT:US. 
A 
man that is married and got a 
good wife, 
Finds it the happiest time in his life.

But still in this soul thine image will bloom. 
Thy hopes with thee I'll share, 
Thy wants shall be my care.

FAR AWAY FROM THP HOME OF 
HOOD. 
FAR away from the h 
Whose old see 
The meadow 
And 
me of my childhood, 
es return with a 
sigh, 
, 
the cottage, and wildwood, 
stream let that meanders by; 
me faces that ever look'cl loving 
And hearts that were genial and true, 
Through the great world for years to be roving, 
My Willie, my dear one, with you; 
Through the great world for years to be roving, 
My Willie, my dear one, with you. 
Thou hast promised thy darling to cherish, 
Thy nestling so loving, so weak, 
And though other joys may all perish, 
No more than thy love do I 
seek. 
The heart of fond woman, remember, 
As the tendril clings closely and true, 
I'll the spring share, and blasts of December, 
My Willie, my dear one, with you; 
I'll the spring share and blasts of December, 
My Willie, my dear one, with you. 
I'll be near thee in gladness and sorrow, 
Though weal or though woe may betide, 
And when dark clouds hang over the morrow, 
here's a 
bosom in which to confide. 
I'll for thee soothe the weary sick pillow, 
The hopes in my sad heart renew, 
And defy the rude rage of the billow, 
My Willie, my dear one, with you ; 
And defy the rude rage of the billow, 
My Willie, my dear one, with you. 
And when years have changed thee, my lover, 
When thy hair is of silvery hue, 
When the race of life is nearly over, 
Eternity's goal is in view, 
Our sorrows will then be requited, 
All changed from the old to the new, 
And I 
pray to be ever united, 
My Willie, my dear one, with you; 
And I 
pray to be ever united, 
My Willie, my dear one, with you.

The Music of this song is published by E. 11. HARDING, 288 Bowery, New 
York. 
Price 10 cents. 
I 
KNOW a 
little girl, 
The best in all the world ; 
Her equal is not living in the laud ! 
I 
see her ev'ry day, 
My pretty Kitty May, 
And when we meet I 
squeeze her little hand ! 
Oh ! how she makes me sigh! 
She's just as sweet as pie 
O 
pretty Kitty May, 
So charming and so gay; 
Her equal is not living in the land; 
She says she will be mine— 
() happiness divine 
For me she wears a 
ring upon her hand. (
Dance.) 
She's worth her weight in gold, 
And lovely to behold; 
Her smile of love, so gentle and serene, 
Shines o'er me like the sun. 
And will when we are one ; 
(), won't she be a 
perfect little queen. 
Oh, how she makes me sigh 
She's just as sweet as pie ! 
O pretty Kitty May, 
• charming and so gay; 
Her equal is not living in the land ; 
She says she \vitt be mine— 
(); happiness divine! 
For me she wears a 
ring upon her hand. (
Dnace.) 
No voice can sing as sweet, 
No form can look so neat; 
I 
know no gladness when we are apart; 
I 
wish the weary day 
To fly with wings away, 
That I 
may press her fondly to my heart! 
Oh, how she makes me sigh ! 
She's just as sweet as pie!

pretty Kitty May, 
So charming and so gay; 
Her equal is not living in the land ; 
She says she will be mine-
0, happiness divine! 
For me she wears a

Sung by Tom BARRY. 
OF 
all blessinos on earth many people agree, 
An affectionate friend is the best ; 
And there's hardly a 
treasure so far as I 
see, 
That's more likely to be in request. 
As I 
chanced long ago to be caught in a 
snare, 
To advise I 
may safely pretend ; 
So I 
beg you to choose with particular care, 
When you choose a 
particular friend.. 
CHORUS. 
Friendship's a 
jewel both precious and rare. 
And scarce to be found in this world, I 
declare, 
So I 
bid you to choose with particular care, 
When you choose a 
particular friend. - 
I 
once had an acquaintance, but not to be rash, 
I'll refer to him simply as Jones, 
And advanced him a 
good many trifles in cash, 
Which of course I 
regarded as loans ; 
When I 
mentioned the fact in a 
year or two, 
'Twas without any wish to offend, 
But he said that the shabbiest thing I 
could do, 
Was to dun a 
particular friend. 
Friendship's a 
jewel, etc. 
At the time I 
acknowledged I 
didn't much care, 
For it seetri'd there was little to fear • 
I 
was courting a 
lady accomplished and fair, 
Who had nearly ten thousand a 
year. 
But the matters went on in a 
flourishing way, 
They were far from correct in the end ; 
I 
was cut out by Jones I 
ant sorry to say, 
She prefered my perticnlar friend. 
Friendship's a 
jewel etc. 
I 
was robb'd of.my monoy, and robb'd of my wife, 
By this very respectable man ; 
And . 
to keep up a 
decent position in life, 
Is as much as I 
possibly can. 
Mr. Jones is ungrateful for all that is passed, 
And to know me will scarce condescend ; 
I 
was cut like a 
pauper on Saturday last, 
When I 
met my particular friend. 
Friendship's a 
jewel, etc. 
LONG, 
LONG AGO. 
TELL me the tales that to me were so dear, 
Long, long ago—long, long ago; 
Sing me the songs I 
delighted to hear, 
Long, long ago—long ago. 
Now you are come, all my grief is removed, 
Let me forget that so long you have roved, 
Let me believe that you love as you're loved, 
Long, long ago— long ago. 
Do you remember the path where we met, 
Long, long ago—long, long ago ? 
Ah ! yes, you told me you ne'er would forget, 
Long, long ago—long ago. 
Then to all others my smile you prefered, 
Love, when you spoke, gave a 
charm to each word ; 
Still my heart treasures the praises I 
beard, 
Long, long ago—long ago. 
Though by your kindness my fond hopes were raised, 
Lona, long ago—long, long ago, 
You by more eloquent lips have been praised, 
Long, long ago—long ago. 
But by long absence your truth has been tried, 
Still to your accents I 
listen with pride, 
Blest as I 
was when I 
sat by your side, 
Long, long ago—long ago. 
DON'T BE SORROWFUL, 
DARLING.

STANDING AT THE GATE WITH ADA. 
Sung by JENNIE ENGEL. 
Written and composed by SAM. BAGNALL. 
ONE summer night some time ago, when birds had gone to 
sleep, 
And little stars at heaven's gate came out to wink and peep : 
The lilies and the pretty flowers wafted sweet perfume, 
A 
shepherd's pipe was heard afar, to play this pretty tune. 
CHORUS. 
While standing at the gate with Ada, 
'While standing at the gate with Ada, 
While standing at the gate with Ada, 
One evening rather late. 
I 
press'd her hand beneath the tree, the lilac kissed her cheek. 
Her pouting lips were just apart, her sigh was soft anti sweet ; 
The odor of her balmy breath was like sweet Indian spice, 
I 
stole a 
sweet enchanting kiss, I 
might have stole it thrice. 
While standing at the gate, etc. 
A naughty bee, out rather late, that moment by me flew, 
And his style quite plainly told he had been drinking dew ; • 
So deeming us too near his house, my cheek he quickly stung, 
And as he flew into his-hive right merrily he sung. 
While standing at the gate, etc. 
I 
bade my love a 
sweet good- night, the hour was growing late, 
She press'd her lips against my cheek, and closed the wicket 
gate ; 
Click, went the latch, the door it creaked, I 
sighed, good night, 
fair maid, 
And to my love, my own fond dove, I 
breathed this serenade. 
I'm waiting at the gate, etc.

She msde my heart flipperty,.flippety, flutter, 
And she told me on the dance she was sound.

WHEN SHALL WE ALL MEET AGAIN ? 
W HEN shall we all meet again 7 
When shall we all meet again 7 
Oft the fiow'rs of spring shall blow, 
Oft the skies of summer glow, 
Oft shall stormy winter reign 
Ere we all shall meet again.; 
Oft shall stormy winter reign 
Ere we all shall meet again. 
Youth's bright dream will pass away, 
And our locks Nvith age be gray, 
For the living, for the dead, 
Tears will flow and prayers be said— 
Hours- 
of joy and hours of pain— 
Ere we all shall meet again ; 
Hours of joy and hours of pain— 
Ere we all shall meet again. 
Though in different lands we roam, 
Far from this our long- loved home, 
Though between us proudly rise 
Mountains mingling with the skies, 
Yet in memory's far domain, 
Oft shall we all meet again ; 
Yet in memory's far domain, 
Oft shall we all meet again. 
When the welcome goal is won, 
And life's wearying task is done; 
When oblivion's noiseless tide 
O'er our parted graves shall glide, 
Where our loved and lost ones reigns 
There may we all meet again ; 
Where our luved and lost ones reign, 
There may we all meet again, 
STEADY COMPANY. 
SONG AND DANCE. 
By NED. HARRIGAN. 
On ! ain't it nice on Wednesday eve, 
The time when lovers meet, 
.To have your girl lean on your arm, 
Oh, my ! ain't it a 
treat I 
Just once a 
week a 
call I 
make, 
To see my little one, 
She's just as sweet to me as cake 
Or a 
dainty sugar plum. 
CLIORES. 
I 
am keeping steady, steady company, 
Where there is lots of fun, yes, lots of fun for me ; 
I 
visit Jane on Wednesday eve, 
Just when the clock strikes nine. 
Now, really, folks, I 
do believe 
Sonic day she will be mine ; 
Her folks have no objection 
To my calling at the house, 
For I'm high in their affections, 
Just as innocent as a 
mouse. 
Jane blushes, too, all over her face, 
When I 
kiss her at the door, 
In all her blush and smile I 
trace, 
A 
lingering wish for more. 
I 
am keeping, etc. 
Now, young men, all just bear in mind. 
Same charmer you must get ; 
Some nice young damsel you must find, 
That you can call your pet. 
And call on her just once a 
week, 
You can do it if you try, 
With kisses one another greet, 
The same as Jane and I. 
I 
am keeping, etc..

As my sweet lovely Jean. 
KERMOODLE KERIVIOODLE KEYI 00. 
Sung by LARRY TOOLEY. 
Am.—" When Johnny Comes Marching Home." 
I'LL sing to you of a 
big Injun, 
Choctaw! oh, law 
He really was a 
number one, 
Oh, la ! hi, yah ! 
You never heard such a 
terrible yaw, 
Or felt the weight of such a 
paw ; 
Yet he dearly loved a 
little squaw, 
Called Kermoodle Kermoodle Kemoo. 
(Repeat.) 
This Injun now was seven miles high, 
I 
guess, more or less. 
His head it almost touched the sky, 
I 
guess, oh, yes! 
He jumped ten miles at a 
single bound, 
Although his feet weighed fifty pound, 
And he danced a 
jig when he heard the sound 
Of Kermoodle Kermoodle Kemoo. 
(Repeat.) 
Kermoodle she loved her big Injun, 
With regard, so bard ! 
That she and he agreed to be one, 
All right, that night! 
But up came a 
soldier all in blue, 
And shot Mr. Injun through and through, 
Till he yelled out hoop-de-dooden-do, 
At Kermoodle Kermoodle Kemoo. 
The Injun did the bucket kick, 
The shot made him drop, 
Kermoodle cried till she was sick, 
All wet with regret. 
She saw the Injun under ground all right, 
Then gave a 
scream with all her might, 
And married the soldier out of spite, 
Did Kermoodle Kermoodle Kemoo. 
(kpeat.)

THIS IS WHAT I 
DID. 
Sung by JOHNNY THOMPSON. 
KIND friends, I'm glad to see you a-smiling all around; 
I 
think I 
can amuse you, for I 
feel so good and sound; 
Oh, at dancing I'm perfection to the music of the fld, 
And when day's work is done to have our fun 
This is what I 
did. (
Dance.) 
When I 
first came to the city I 
was stylish to the feet; 
The ladies all they are so tall and dress so very neat ; 
I 
went into an auction store an 
for these shoes did bid, 
Ann when the man asked ma forsthe cash, 
This is what I 
did. (Dance.) 
When I 
went to get married, my girl was straight and tall, 
And master's clothes they fitted me like paper on the wall ; 
The parson says to me, Young man, which girl are you to wed 7 
When I 
answered the old preacher man, 
This is what I 
did. (Dance.) 
AS SWEET AS A ROSE IS SHE. 
Written by BOBBY NEWCOMB. 
As sweet as a 
rose is she, 
So charming in form and in pace ; 
Her eyes they have pierced my heart through, 
And I 
constantly dream of her face. 
Her voice is as clear as the lark 
That sings with the rising of the day, 
Her breath is as fragrant and sweet 
As the white blossomed flowers of May. 
CHORUS. 
As sweet as a 
rose is she, 
Her eyes they sparkle bright ; 
Fairer than all to me, 
I 
think of her day and night, 
There's none in this world so wide 
could be the same to me, 
As the girl I'd call my bride, 
As sweet as a 
rose is she. 
As sweet as a 
rose is she, 
The girl who has won all my love ; 
I'd willingly sacrifice life, 
To call her my own turtle dove. 
But she laughs in my face when I 
speak, 
And when I 
make love says, " I 
shan't," 
Then tells me I 
must her forget ; 
And I 
would, but then really I 
can't. 
As sweet as a 
rose, etc. 
As sweet as a 
rose is she, 
The girl for whose hand I 
have sighed ; 
The wealth of the world I 
would give, 
If only to call her my bride. 
I 
hope I 
may yet win her hand, 
That would make me so happy for life, 
If I 
do, when I 
meet you again, 
Then perhaps I 
will show you my wife. 
As sweet as a 
rose, etc.

I WISH YOUR MOTHER WOULD COME. 
I 
HAVE to hold the child the while my wife is out ; 
It makes me feel quite wild the way she gads about ; 
hush- a, bush-a-bye—there, suck its little thumb, 
And don't begin to cry. 
Oh! I 
wish your mother would come. 
Oh! I 
wish your mother would come. 
I 
gave the child some gruel, still louder tho' it cried, 
For I 
gave it boiling hot, and burnt its poor inside; 
wish that I 
were deaf, or else the child were dumb, 
For I 
cannot stand that noise. 
Oh I 
I 
wish your mother would 
come. 
Oh! I 
wish your mother would come. 
I 
used to think my wife had nought all day to do, 
But this nursing, ' pon my life, is work enough for two ; 
It's cutting its little teeth—there's one just thro' his gum— 
Be quiet, you little thief. 
Oh ! I 
wish your mother would come. 
! 
I 
wish your mother would come. 
If I 
only put him down, and chance to turn my back, 
lie gets the saucepan lid, and looks like a 
little black ; 
Jack and Jill went up a 
hill, turn ti turn, turn ti tuna ; 
I've got on all my Sunday clothes. 
Oh! I 
wish your mother 
would come. 
Oh! I 
wish your mother would come. 
Oh, husbands, who will blame your wives for doing nought, 
Just stop at home one day—experience must be bought ; 
I've only stopp'd two hours, and tho' you may think it rum, 
For more than half that time, oh ! I've wished your mother 
would come. 
Oh! I've wished your mother would come.

THE CHAP IN NUMBER NINE. 
By J. B 
MURPHY. 
Sung by JOHNNY W ILD. 
FOLKS wonder why I 
look so glum and seldom show my face, 
As once I 
did, a 
year ago, in every public place; 
But they don't know how my poor heart was shivered up so fine, 
By him that lives across the street—the chap in No. 9. 
CHORUS. 
My heart is broke—I 
nearly choke—when thinking of the time, 
That Sarah Glass—run off,. alas—with the chap in No. 9. 
I'll tell you simply how it was and how it came to pass : 
I 
loved a 
chambermaid next door, her name was Sarah Glass; 
I 
thought her soul a 
mirror pure—reflecting truth to mine, 
Tho' oft she flashed a 
smile upon the chap in No. 9. 
My heart is broke, etc. 
I 
took Miss Glass to operas, balls, and every brilliant place, 
And doated on her crystal eyes and clear, transparent face ; 
I 
bought her gems of sparkling hue and presents rare and fine, 
And dreamed of her and future bliss, nor thought of No. 9. 
My heart is broke, etc. 
At length the wished-for time was fixed to join our fates for life. 
When Sarah Glass should ease my pains and be my darling wife; 
I 
danced and sang all day with joy, such bliss I 
can't define, 
Nor envied once the fortunes of the chap in No. O. 
My heart is broke, etc. 
Alas! upon the very day that we were to be wed, 
My hopes were shattered— Sarah Glass cleared out, vamoosed 
and fled ; 
Her vows as brittle as her name, she broke with full design, 
She sloped—run off—got—went—with the chap in No. 9. 
My heart is broke, etc. 
And now the dark and dismal hours in loneliness I 
pass, 
Like some deserted picture- frame, forsaken by my glass ; 
Life's bitter goblet thus I 
drain and not a 
hope is mine, 
For they were smashed to pieces by the chap in No. 9. 
My heart is broke, etc. 
OH! SING TO ME! 
Oft ! sing to me one song of thine, 
One song before we part; 
That I 
may bear away with me 
Its music in my heart. 
Let it be a 
gentle one, 
A 
song of early joy ; 
Such as a 
fair-haired maiden sings, 
To win her much- loved boy. 
0 ! Sing to me the song I 
heard, 
The other day, at noon ; 
When it came to me like a 
warbling bird, 
And ceased as short and soon. 
Bashfully that song was still, 
For I 
started from out the trees ; 
So the bird is hush, when the bramble bush 
Stirs with the passing breeze. 
Turn lot so tearfully away-
1 
cannot bear to part, 
With anything but hope and joy 
In the swelling of my heart. 
Look up to me with lauehin,Y eyes— 
We shall meet again ere lona ; 
And then the greeting I 
shall have, 
Will be thy gentle song. 
So sing to me that song of joy. 
That song of summer bowers, 
3lurmurina like the soft warm breath 
Of a 
south wind over flowers. 
I 
will kiss thee as thou warblest on, 
My token as I 
part, 
And so will bear away with we 
The music in my heart.
