I met Charles "Cholly" DeStefano and his brother on 
October 15 while poking around G—Tuckerton; 15GT, having previously 
noticed that a lot of clamming seemed to be done in that area. 
Cholly and his brother were counting clams 
in the back of 
Cholly's pickup when I ran into them. 
They had just caught them 
for the second time 
in their leased grounds, where the clams had 
been left for a month to purify out the pollution from the area 
where they were originally caught (off Rumson, N.J.). 
I asked 
them if I could go along with them on their next clamming trip 
and they agreed. 
(animal) 
On the morning of the 17th I met Cholly at the Parkway exit 
(109) G—Rumson; Rumson Twp.7 
(not in Pinelands Reserve) and 
followed him out to where his boat was tied up. 
We were met 
there by a young man 
in his twenties who had been apprenticing 
with Cholly and who towed the boat into the dock from where it 
had been tied up a few yards out. 
On the way out I learned some 
of the problems the clammer faces. 
Most of the areas where clams can be caught in clean water 
have been pretty well fished out, so the state has set up a 
"relay" program whereby clams can be taken in strictly regulated 
areas that were hitherto closed because of pollution, then dumped 
into a clean area, allowed to remain there for a month and then 
harvested a second time. 
The clams therefore have to be caught 
twice. 
Conservation. 
Present prices for clams are: 
6 cents for "chowders," the 
larger clams, 8 cents for "cherries,' the cherrystones of 
restaurant fame, and 12 cents for "nicks," the clammers slang for 
littlenecks. 
Cholly noted that 10-20 years ago the price for 
chowder clams was also 6 cents. 
Two or three thousand clams are 
considered a good catch nowadays, and, based on an average price 
of 8 cents, this works out to $160—$240, divided by two, since 
they have to be caught twice, or $80—$120 a day when things are 
going well. 
As I was soon to observe, 
it takes a lot of good 
hard work to pull 
in this many clams. 
Czarnecki--83 Fieldnotes 
page 1 
Clammers work with long—handled rakes of adjustable length. 
The rake head 
is characterized by the size of the basket portion 
and the length of the teeth, with shorter teeth being more 
appropriate for a rocky bottom, while longer teeth are used on a 
muddy bottom. 
Today Cholly was using the long toothed variety, 
called a shinnecock rake, designed in N.Y. 
The smaller rake 
is called a Rhode Island rake. 
The length of the rake handle is 
adjusted by sliding sections that "nest" inside each other and 
are adjusted with hose clamps. 
Cholly's contribution to rake 
design was to move the point at which the rake head is attached 
to the rake handle farther down toward the rake head, thereby 
alleviating much of the torque on the drilled connection, which 
sometimes tears the softer metal of the handle. 
Technology. 
In working with a rake, the rake 
is cast out with a loose 
grip so the hose clamps do not tear the hands, and 
is caught at 
the "T" at the end of the handle at the end of the cast. 
There 
is a lot of touch involved here, as too vigorous a cast would 
result in the rake being thrown away, while too short a cast 
results in too little area being covered. 
The length of the rake 
handle depends on the depth of the water being worked. 
In 
working an area, Cholly usually mentally lays out a 100 x 200 
foot square, using dead reckoning. 
Since most clamming occurs 
within sight of 
land (today just about 10-20 yards offshore), 
it 
is quite easy to visualize these squares. Raking is done in a kind 
of rhythmic, circular motion, slowly digging at the bottom while 
pulling the rake toward the boat. The rake 
is pulled 
in toward the 
boat in the same direction the current is moving, so the current 
is actually pushing the boat away from the rake head. After the 
boat drifts down the length of the square, the clammer 
moves the boat back to the beginning and repeats the process five 
or six times before moving over 5 or 6 feet. 
The rake head 
is 
three feet wide, so the raked strips are pretty close together if 
not exactly adjacent. 
Every so often Cholly would let the rake 
handle "T" rest against his stomach and lean on 
it, thereby 
pushing the boat down away from the starting point. 
The stiller 
the water, the more this method has to be used to move down the 
course. 
Each time the rake 
is thrown and pulled 
in 
is referred to as 
a "grab", and a good grab may bring 
in 
100 lb. 
of material. 
Not 
all 
of this is clams — there are shells, rocks, crabs, bottles, 
and an occasional flounder or oyster cracker. 
In a really good 
spot, the clammer can "mug 'em up" or catch a lot of clams. 
The 
best spots are "pure corn," that is, solid clams, no shells or 
trash. 
When a clammer finds a good spot, he 
is 
"on the meat," 
"meat" meaning clams. 
Folk speech and naming. 
The area where we were clamming seemed to be yielding a lot 
of clams, and Cholly's apprentice, Glen Hagaman, seemed to be 
near ecstatic, today being the best day he ever had (about 2000 
clams). 
The clams seemed to me to be quite dirty, covered as 
they were with a thick coat of oil from the mud they were taken 
Czarnecki--83 Fieldnotes 
page 2 
from. 
The mud did not easily wash off and had quite an 
unpleasant smell, but Cholly reassured me they were quite safe 
in 
spite of the relay requirement by opening one up and eating 
it on 
the spot. 
He said he would never sell anything he wouldn't eat 
himself. 
One of the problems generated by the relay system is that of 
the "bootlegger." 
A bootlegger is someone who takes clams in a 
restricted area or who takes clams that are supposed to be 
transplanted and sells them by skipping the second stage of the 
process. 
Many clammers seem to think that areas that are part of 
the relay program are in fact quite safe and that the state would 
not open up a really polluted area at all. 
They 
therefore 
resent the restrictions placed on them by the program and feel 
that they are being forced to catch the same clams twice when in 
fact once would be enough. 
This relationship with the 
authorities is not at all ameliorated by the marine police's 
habit of making trivial checks for licenses and safety whistles 
which the clammers are required to carry. 
"When you show them 
the whistle, they ask you to blow it," Cholly's brother, Don, 
noted sarcastically. 
The relationship with the authorities seems 
to be a kind of Robin Hood thing, with the police perceived as 
the bad guys and the clammers as good outlaws. 
The clammers 
themselves don't have anything against the bootleggers since they 
perceive most of the regulations as ridiculous anyway. 
Crime, 
law enforcement. 
Clams caught on the relay program have to be bagged and then 
sealed with wire and a lead seal. 
One of the clammers, 
in this 
case Cholly, serves as relay coordinator and must fill out a 
"Hard Clam Relay Receipt" from the N.J. Dept. of Environmental 
Protection, Division of Fish, Game and Wildlife, Bureau of Law 
Enforcement, which shows where the clams were caught, how many, 
and the destination of the clams. 
Compliance is routinely 
checked by the marine police. 
One of the biggest problems of the relay program is that it 
leaves the clammer extremely vulnerable to theft. 
The thief need 
only keep an eye on the leased lots and watch when the clammer 
dumps his relayed clams onto his lot. 
All 
he has to do then 
is 
to go out and rake them up. 
While this 
is not my idea of easy 
thieving (each rakeful weighs around 100 pounds), the practice 
is apparently quite common, and every clammer nurses fantasies of 
revenge on the character who 
is dastardly enough to raid his clam 
beds. 
Some clammers also resent the influx over the past ten years 
or so of students and 
weekend and summer people who clam to make 
extra money or for recreation. 
This makes it harder for people 
who do 
it as a full time way of making a living. 
Cholly, for 
example, seemed quite bitter that as a Vietnam veteran he could 
not find a job 
in civilian life doing what he was trained in the 
service to do — operating a crane. 
He then turned to clamming as 
Czarnecki--83 Fieldnotes 
page 3 
a means of supporting his wife and five children. 
This particular day, however, ended well for clammer and 
photographer alike. 
Cholly caught 2300 clams, his apprentice 
Glen about 2000, while brother Don, who had been struggling using 
the wrong sized rake, got 1400. 
A policeman casually cruised by 
the dock as we unloaded, keeping an eye on what was going on, and 
Cholly headed back to Tuckerton to dump his clams in order to 
catch them once again.

On Tuesday the 15th I went out with Tom Brown to set 
traps for fox and coon. 
The process looks like this: 
1) 
A site for setting the trap is selected. 
In every case, 
Tom chose to set a trap next to a log, stump, or tree base, 
usually a small fallen log. 
Better yet is a spot where two or 
more logs cross. 
The idea is to force the animal to walk toward 
the trap from the right direction. 
2) 
Using a long—handled garden shovel about six inches 
in 
diameter, a hole is dug diagonally into the ground extending 
under the fallen log, with a flattened area just in front of the 
hole large enough to accommodate the leg—hold trap. 
The dirt is 
placed in a small sieve to be sprinkled over the trap later. 
3) 
The trap 
is set and placed 
in position. 
The position of 
the trap basically depends upon where the trapper thinks the 
animal will place his foot when he comes up to the hole to sniff 
the 
lure or eat the bait. 
Generally the center or trigger of the 
trap 
is six inches to a foot from the center of the hole. 
4) 
A special device called a cap 
is placed over the trigger 
to prevent accidental springing of the trap. 
Dirt is then tamped 
down into the trap base and around the cap so the trap 
is firmly 
anchored in the ground and will not move and spook the animal. 
The cap 
is removed. 
5) 
The dirt in the sieve 
is gently sprinkled over the trap 
to cover it up. 
The trapper may then also cover the dirt with 
leaves or needles, very gently so as to not set off the trap. 
6) 
The trap 
is baited 
in one or more of the following ways: 
a) 
A piece of rotten meat is placed into the hole. 
Sometimes a bit of the carcass of a previously trapped animal 
is used. 
b) 
A few drops of fox lure are dripped onto the 
log 
or stump. 
Tom uses two types, one for a regular set, and "gland 
lure" used for a "post set," the 
latter being designed to attract 
the animal 
to a urination spot rather than a feeding spot. 
c) 
Fox urine may be sprayed around the hole or on the 
log. 
This is almost always used on a post set, and Tom uses 
it 
quite frequently on regular sets as well. 
When handling traps rubber gloves are used to avoid leaving 
Czarnecki--83 Fieldnotes 
page 5 
a scent. 
Traps are previously prepared by boiling and coating 
them, then storing them in cedar boughs. 
A trap that has been 
handled will have to be treated again before being used.

On Thursday the 17th I returned to Tom Brown's G—Millville; 
Millville Twp.] to tend the traps that he set on Tuesday. 
As it 
turned out, he had caught two grey fox and a coon 
in the traps we 
set on Tuesday. 
This time we had less luck. 
One trap had been 
robbed, probably of a red fox judging by the tracks, and two had 
possums, not a very profitable animal for a trapper, the fur 
bringing only $2.50 as compared to around $30 for a fox. 
Tom 
released the first possum but decided to kill the second because 
he thought it would interfere with fox trapping by getting caught 
again. 
He dispatched the animal with a shot between the eyes 
with a .22 pellet, a slightly smaller charge than a .22 short. 
While not a great day as far as trapping is concerned, this at 
least allowed me to observe the skinning process. 
Basically, the 
legs are cut off and the skin 
is peeled off from the bottom 
towards the head, with as much care as possible taken not to tear 
the hide. 
The part requiring the most care 
is removing the skin 
around the head. 
The inside out skin 
is then pulled over a 
"fleshing beam", which 
is a 2 by 6 rounded at the edges and 
brought to a taper at the end, smoothed and mounted at about a 30 
degree angle into a bench about 15 inches high, made of a plank 
three or so feet long nailed onto two sections of tree stump. 
This 
is a convenient mount for scraping the fat off the hide. 
The scraped hide is then mounted on a stretcher, V—shaped and 
adjustable, to dry for a few days to a week, the length of time 
depending on the type of skin, the temperature, and humidity. 
Muskrats, however, may be sold without skinning them and are 
skinned out by the buyers. 
Tom, by the way, occasionally builds 
fleshing beams for other trappers.

Recommendations 
Equipment: 
I found that several people could have used flashes. 
Perhaps some research into a good hardy portable flash might be 
in order. A Vivitar 283 or one of 
its new cousins, Sunpak or the 
like might do the trick. 
An expanded light system might also be useful. 
A typical 
interior might be reasonably well yet simply lit using the two 
Lowell 
lights as bounced overall 
light boosters, with a couple of 
smaller, say 250 watt lights to give some highlights and 
modelling. 
In my opinion the simplest and most accurate means of determining 
exposure, with the fewest exceptions to the rule, 
is with 
an 
incident light meter. 
Considering the cost of film, I suspect 
that a good meter would pay for itself rather quickly. 
I am 
quite fond of my Minolta, which when set on a shutter speed gives 
an f-stop at the touch of a button. 
It also reads flash. 
By now 
there may also be something just as good and less expensive. 
The photographer's role 
in the project: 
If future projects continue to make extensive use of 
photography by non-professionals, 
it would be a good idea to 
think up ways to get them to take better advantage of the photo-
grapher as a resource. 
My experience in this project was that it 
was personality factors and characteristics rather than interest 
that determined whether or not a fieldworker sought out advice 
from the photographer. 
Perhaps this is because people who are 
enthusiastic about photography also tend to be introspective. 
I 
think one solution that could be tried would be two or three 
semi-formal meetings at the beginning of the project on topics 
like "How to use a light meter," How to use a flash," etc., 
perhaps an hour a shot in the evening. 
Just as 
it 
is empha-
sized 
in the photographer's contract that he 
is 
to act as a 
resource when necessary, 
it should also be emphasized in the 
fieldworker's contract that he be required to consult on a 
regular basis with the photographer, especially insofar as the 
Czarnecki--83 Fieldnotes

technical aspects of the work are concerned. 
A lot of work I 
saw going across the light table could have benefited enormously 
from a little technical 
improvement.

TXO1: For Tom Brown of Millville, 
the swamp at the mouth of the 
G—Great Egg Harbor River; 07GT in southern New Jersey 
is simply 
"the meadow." Hardly the benevolent, rolling meadow of "Lassie" 
fame, 
it 
is rather a vast bog of waist—deep mud punctuated by 
drier stretches where the hair—like salt hay grows, or by the 
"tussocks" (a 
local term, spelling unconfirmed) of relatively 
more solid mud that is held together in a mass by the roots of 
foxtail grass (plant), phragmites, and other marsh plants. It is 
this environment, however, that is 
ideal for Tom's work, muskrat 
trapping. (animal) 
The muskrats build "houses" which are really mounds of swamp 
grasses, and enter them through several tunnel holes at the base. 
A large house may be four feet or so tall, and to Tom it 
is a 
real 
"bruiser." Stretching outward from the "house" into the 
swamp is a maze of muskrat "runs," tunnels six to twelve inches 
or more in diameter that may be either on the surface ("surface 
runs") or actually tunneled through the mud, often several feet 
down. A particularly deep tunnel section 
is a "diving hole." It 
is 
in these runs that Tom sets his traps. folk speech and naming 
Things had been kind of quiet in the trapping business for 
Tom in the several weeks before my mid—February excursion with 
him. Extremely cold weather had frozen the traps open as well as 
icing up the actual runs themselves. Under such extremely cold 
conditions, the muskrats do not move about foraging as they 
usually do on the tender roots of the swamp grasses. They simply 
huddle up 
in their "houses," surviving on the accumulated supply 
of food which 
is the "house" itself. But with the weather going 
up 
into the high 50s and even the 60s, Tom expected that trapping 
would be pretty good. 
We arrived on the meadow at about 8 in the morning, not so 
much to get an early start as to synchronize with the low tide, 
which on this day started in the morning and lasted for four 
hours. Many of the areas where traps are set are actually under 
water during high tide, and the muskrats often swim through them. 
"Tending" the trap line required us 
to check out about 140 trap 
Czarnecki--84 Fieldnotes 
page 10 
sets 
in the area where Tom traps. (See USGS map, Marmon 
Quadrangle. The area Tom traps 
is just north of the unmarked 
Little Aaro (Aaron ? — ed.) 
Creek, which is the next creek north 
of Long Point Creek. This area is just to the west of the Great Egg 
Harbor River at the head of the swamp. The nearest town 
is Estell 
Manor. 
The trap locations are marked by stakes with small strips of 
rag tied to them. They did not seem entirely necessary since Tom 
knew where they all were even without the markings but they do 
spend things up a bit. The drawback is that other trappers or 
robbers can see where they are as well and a certain amount of 
thieving does seem to go on among the locals. The identity of the 
culprits eventually becomes known through the telltale trails of 
distinctive tire markings, footprints, etc., all 
of which are 
pretty well known to the trappers. Tom complained about several 
traps being robbed this season, particularly the fox sets (the 
furs being worth $40 and up, higher for the reds than the greys). 
The trap most commonly used for muskrat is the Conibear (see 
photos), a trap that is more often than not a killer trap which 
snaps the animal's neck or back. The traps are set either deep 
in 
a muskrat run, diving hole, or tunnel, or else on the surface 
(surface set). The trap must be secured just enough so that the 
trap offers enough resistance when the animal pushes against the 
trigger. With this trap, the muskrat actually steps through the 
center of the trap while walking or swimming through his 
accustomed "runs." If by chance the trap catches only a leg, 
which is 
rather unlikely, the animal dies by drowning when the 
tide comes in. 
I have never ceased to be amazed at what a 70—year old man 
who has been outdoors all 
his life can do and Tom Brown was 
another remarkable example. The "meadow" 
is so interlaced with 
muskrat runs over most of 
its area that the ratio of knee—deep 
mud to relatively solid footing is about 4 to 
1. A walking stick 
is a necessity, not only to maintain and regain one's balance 
while picking one's way across the "tussocks," but also to test 
the ground out ahead of one's feet to avoid a costly slip that 
often ends up sinking thigh and even waist deep into the mud. 
More than once I came within millimeters of having mud and water 
pour over the top of my hip boots. The degree of suction at this 
point is often so great that it 
is easier to walk out of the 
boots than 
it 
is to extricate leg and boot together. I was told 
that in very deep mud (i.e., waist deep) the trick 
is to either 
lay backwards or forwards and to try to extricate yourself from 
the position. A walking stick often 
is of help in getting a grip 
on something. 
A quick glance at the USGS map shows a series of parallel 
sets of cross—hatched lines. Out on the "meadow" nothing 
like 
this 
is visible but from time to time we had to cross "ditches" 2 
to 
10 feet wide with usually not much more than a trickle of 
Czarnecki--84 Fieldnotes 
page 11 
water, say ankle deep, over mud which was often several feet 
deep. Tom explained that these were dug with backhoes as drainage 
ditches to help control the mosquito problem. Crossing these 
ditches is something I would not recommend any novice to try 
alone, but Tom seemed to know where the relatively solid footing 
was and how to get from one side to the other in the fewest 
steps. Sometimes he would kneel his way through a particularly 
soft area, using his legs as snowshoes. With all 
the camera 
equipment around my neck and shoulders, I was very much 
in need 
of a helping hand 
in these spots. 
But one aspect of the 
battle over the mosquitoes created a situation that Tom could not 
control. Despite the 
ideal weather, the high temperatures, and 
several days of rain which helped to melt the 
ice, there were no 
rats 
in the houses. There were very few tracks to be seen 
anywhere, and likewise only a few sets of droppings. "He seems to 
be constipated," Tom noted, pointing out the dry clumped nature 
of the excreta, which are normally "like pills." Of course it 
is 
impossible to tell exactly why the muskrats have gone, but Tom 
speculates it may be because of the spraying for mosquitoes. A 
friend who traps in a private area not sprayed caught 120 rats on 
that day to our 2. A three—to—one trap—to—catch ratio 
is pretty 
good according to Tom, and his friends had about 395 traps out. 
It would be interesting, I think, to look at the muskrat 
catches in these areas and study them in relation to the amount 
of spraying going on. Perhaps such data are available through the 
Department of Fish and Game. This 
is a bit out of my area but the 
lack of animals in the area which was so obviously a natural 
habitat was rather eerie. 
Back to folklore for a moment. 
It 
is 
interesting, I think, 
to take a look at the whole trapping "ethos" that Tom Brown is 
coming out of. I got some hint of 
it just before fal I 
ing asleep 
in his trapper's cabin, where he keeps his old magazines and 
memorabilia. Tom has been was trapping since about 1921 when he 
was 11 years old. At that time a magazine called Fish, Fur and 
Game filled pretty much the same function as Field and Stream or 
Outdoor Life do today, except that their accounts of hunting and 
trapping and living off the land were really written by people 
who were, or had been, original pioneers in wilderness areas of 
the West. 
"I 
learned 
it from the magazines," Tom told me, 
"and I 
first caught a few squirrels and rabbits just to keep meat on 
the table." Well, yes, but maybe even more because of a boy's

TXO1: While visiting with Lou Peterson on his boat at the Bivalve 
Packing Co., I chanced onto a practitioner of one of the area's 
dying boatbuilding arts, corking. "Corking," 
presumably a 
dialect pronunciation of the world "caulking," is the method 
whereby the cracks between the planks that form the deck of a 
boat are stuffed to prevent leaking. According to my 
practitioner—informant, Larry Baglio (10 Memorial Ave., Port 
Norris, NJ), there are perhaps ten people in the southern part of 
New Jersey still practicing this old shipbuilder's art. 
"Corking" involves "sticking" (stuffing) a "line" of cotton, 
then "oakum," into the cracks on the deck, then "making" 
(tamping) 
it 
into place. The materials come packed in 
long, rope— 
like lengths, though the oakum has to pre—prepared since it 
is 
thicker in 
its original form. These are stuffed into the cracks 
using a rhythmic motion that requires a deft coordination between 
the 
left hand, equipped with a "finger stall" on which the 
"corking iron" pivots, and the mallet wielding right hand. A word 
or two about each: 
The corking irons are either "sticking" irons (for stuffing 
the material 
into the cracks where a sharp edge 
is used to catch 
the material), or "making" irons (where a blunt edge 
is used to 
tamp the material down into the crack). The other main variation 
on the iron is that it may be curved in 
its plane 
in order to get

lets and irons are hard to come by since neither are

The "finger stall" 
is made of 
leather and is a protection 
against friction as well 
as an extension of the finger, thus 
serving as a pivot. 
Besides the above, the corker uses a special stool, 
basically a wooden box with a canvas (instead of wood) top to 
ease the business of having to sit on something all day long, and 
a hole in the front so that tools can be carried around and and 
easily accessed. 
The other tools commonly used are a "hook" (see photo) and a 
"reefer," both used to ream out old corking (caulking). 
First the raw cotton line 
is stuffed into the cracks, then 
the oakum, which appears to be some kind of chemically treated 
hemp. Larry tells me 
it comes from somewhere in South America, 
though he was not sure where. Finally a tight coat of paint is 
coated over the while business to keep the rain out until the 
whole deck 
is coated. 
The pay rate for this work is $7-10 an hour and a good 
corker can cork about fifty feet in an hour's time. Most of the 
corkers in this area work at the boatyard in Egg Harbor, also 
picking up a few bucks on the side but doing private jobs for 
private owners like Lou. The art of corking is a dying one 
insofar as wooden boats are dying out to be replaced by plastic 
fiberglass, metal, etc. 
In Jersey it may be the diminishing 
supply of cedar for boatbuilding will eventually result in 
its 
extinction.
