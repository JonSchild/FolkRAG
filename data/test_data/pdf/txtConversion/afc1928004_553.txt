••••• 
The old willow chair now so aged and worn, 
Where grandmother sat years before I 
was born. 
Though covered with dust, and so near its decay, 
Is dear to my heart in itc treasures to- day. 
There often my mother would rock me to sleep, 
And when I 
was young o'er my fevered cheek weep; 
And then I 
would list to her low fervent prayer, 
While held in her arms, in the old willow chair. 
CHORUS. 
It rocked me by day, and it rocked me by night, 
While with us sweet songs filled my heart with delight, 
And then her dear lips, would repeat a 
low prayer, 
While holding me safe in the old willow chair. 
do not remember my grandmother mild, 
For when she went home I 
was only a 
child ; 
But mother has told me again and again, 
How calmly she bore all the long years of pain. 
By day and by night, she was happy they say, 
In rocking the hours and the moments away, 
And this is the present she left to our care, 
The best of all treasures her 
old willow chair. Chortizt 
It stood in the kitchen, long, long years ago, 
Through many a 
season of sunshine and snow, 
The old willow chair that our grandmother made, 
And wl,ere in the slumbers of youth I 
was laid, 
And there in the days I 
now love to recall, 
It was by our circle most treasured of all ; 
But now in the garret a 
relic so rare, 
All covered with webs stands the old willow chair.

In the early hours of morning, 
O'er the waves we swiftly go, 
heedless of the sailor's warning. 
Where the foam- capped billows flow; 
For this hour we long have waited, 
And the charms within our reach 
Make our hearts with joy elated, 
Off for Coney Island Beach. 
CHORUS. 
Some may sail across the ocean, 
Which is far beyond our reach, 
While we find enough commotion, 
Down on Coney Island Beach, 
Many pleasures now surround us, 
On this breezy summer day. 
And with charming friends around us, 
O'er the waves we speed away, 
'I ill we reach that isle of gladness, 
Which is just within our each, 
Where we banish all our sadness, 
Down on Coney Island Beach. 
In the chilling surf we shiver, 
But ° Jr hearts are light and free, 
While the wavelets dance and quiver, 
Rolling in front depths of sea. 
And the breeze is softly blowing, 
All our lonely ones should teach, 
That the wise much bliss are knowing, 
Down on Cony Island Beach.

Come, oh! come to my home by the dePp rolling sea, 
Where the fairest of pearls strew the shore, 
And the tides ebb and flow in their beauty and pride, 
While I 
wait for my bonnie Lenore. 
Then, oh! come to tue, on the sands of the sea, 
Where the music of waves thrill the soul, 
I 
have built me a 
home where the foam caps may come, 
And the tempests grow fierce round my goal.

Will you come to my home by the deep rolling sea,

Come, oh I 
come to my home by the deep rolling sea, 
Where the sunshine of life is so fair, 
And the waves throb with .)ain, then as calm as the heart, 
That would win thee such true love to share. 
Then come at the dawn of the morning so bright, 
Or when sunbeams grow dim in the west, 
When the sweet strains are heard, as old ocean is stirred, 
By the tempest grown fierce on its breast. 
Chorus 
Come, oh ! come to my home By the deep rolling sea, 
N1 here the pleasures of life may be found ; 
We will pick up the sl,ells which are strewn on the shore, 
And well bathe in the waves dancing round. 
We'll speak words of love on the samis of the sea, 
And my home shall be thine evermore, 
When old ocean is stirred and sweet music is heard, 
By the happy ones down on the shore.

Don't Blut out the moonlight, mother, 
Let each silver- lighted beam 
Softly on my dying pillow. 
In a 
flood of beauty stream, 
Let it shed its radi,int lustre, 
On my feeble fluttering breast, 
Let it bathe me in its brightness, 
Ere I 
pass away to rest. 
Don't shut out the moonlight, mother, 
Let each silver lighted beam, 
Softly 'o'er my dying pillow, 
In a

Don't shut out the moonlight, mother, 
I 
have ever loved that light, 
And have gazed for hours together, 
In some still andisolemn night. 
On the pale moon slowly floating, 
O'er the starry home on high. 
Dreaming of that land of plenty, 
Far beyond the azure sky. 
Don't shut out the molnlight mother, 
Let it beam on me once more, 
Let it light me through the valley, 
To that far off peaceful shore. 
And when I 
am coldly lying 
In that last long are:mien; sleep, 
Lay me where the silver moonbeams 
Softly o'er my grave will creep.

Oh! wake, bonnie Bessie, the bright morn is breaking,

In heart of the roses so fragrant and fair,

Oh! wake bonnie Bessie, the day dawn is fleeting, 
The horn of the hunter is heard o'er the moor, 
Afar front the highlands and roaming the lowlands, 
Is one true heart yearning to enter your door. 
So fair is the valley in sunshine and gloaming, 
Yet lonely I 
wander my true love i see, 
Oh ! I 
am so weary of watching and waiting, 
Then wake bonnie Bessie, with sweet smiles for me.

How fair are the sunbeams but fairer the shadows, 
Which bring fondest dreams of thy pure love to me. 
Amid the sweet bloom of the heath and the heather, 
Then wake bonnie Bessie, the fair stars to see.

My name is O'Brien from Harlem, 
An Irishman as you can see, 
I 
can sing like a 
thrush or a 
starling, 
Or the little bird up in a 
tree. 
But the gang that stands •there on the corner 
Are trying the teps and the dance, 
And they shout out whenever I'm passing, 
There's 01;rien with his high water pants. 
CHORUS. 
They tell me to go over to England, 
And pay, a 
short visit to France, 
And there to bring out my new fashions, 
And call them the high water panta, 
Last week I 
went to the theatre, 
Along with my first cousin Dan, 
We hired a 
seat down in the parquette, 
Behind the big man in the band. 
When a 
nager came out with a 
banjo, 
lie played up a 
highland clog dance, 
And he gave out a 
gag and con- nun-drum, 
'Bout O'Brien with his high•water pants, 
Cho. 
One night I 
strolled down the Bowery, 
Along with a 
friend Paddy Brock, 
We tho t 
we'd just drop into Geoghan's. 
To try some of his rye and rock. 
W 
hen the gang all cried. there's Dan O'Leary, 
The bar- tender shot me a 
glance, 
Id owld your tongues," then said he to the loafers, 
'I hat's O'Brien with his high-water pants.

never can forget that night, 
With all its inemory's sweet, 
When we, my pretty sparkling pearl, 
So joyously did meet ; 
Your eyes with love were radiant, 
Your face was fresh and fair, 
And yet still more did I 
admire 
The rosebud in your hair 
And yet still more did I 
!
admire 
The rosebud in your hair. 
The rosebud in your hair, 
The rosebud in your hair, 
You'll wear upon our wedding day 
A rosebud in your hair. 
'Twas simple and as beautiful, 
As ever I 
have seen, 
With little buds of myrtle 
And a 
spray of evergreen. 
When fate is kind and gives to me, 
That little face so fair, 
Ilow fondly we'll remember, 
The rosebud in your hair, 
Bow fondly well remember love, 
The rosebud in your hair,

And 113 swallowed it with glee,

his kisses, ma, 
And didn't care to try. 
Of kisses of all sorts and kinds, 
I've surely had mov share. 
From formal kiss of friendship, 
To love's salutation rare; 
But of them all i'in free to own, 
The sweetest one bv far, 
Was the first kiss of love which ope'd 
The eves of Inv mamma. 
Her voice how quick our dream did change, 
From pleasure unto pain. 
Alm! how I 
faltered, when in tears 
I 
softly did explain.

And the skies are soft and fair. 
Come then love and we will wander

Meet me in the grove to-night.

When the drowsy world is sleeping, 
Then I'll tell you of my love. 
Breathing words of sweet devotion, 
We will know no pain or blight; 
Hark ! love to my hearts devotion, 
Meet me in the grove to- night.

I 
am hard up, you don't know me, 
For my clothes are tat'ed and torn, 
My parents died when I 
Was young, 
I'm forsaken. dislikd and forlorn. 
I've travTd this country thro' and thro,' 
On the road and on the rail, 
My limbs era getting stiff and cold, 
For the want of a 
warm meal. 
CHORUS. 
They say why don't you go to work, 
Whed they know there's none to be had, 
They slain the door in front of your face, 
If you ask them for a 
bite of bread. 
Some tramps they beg from door to door, 
And they ask for charity, 
They say they've children ten at home, 
And they can't support their family, 
But place a 
nickle in their hand, 
lo some grog shop they will run, 
A poor man's money they will take, 
And spend it all for rum 
CHORUS. 
.Now that's the kind that want no work, 
For they're weak and sick is their plea, 
When they get bread they'll throw it away 
From a 
wolkingman's poor family. 
'Twas at an humble cot I 
called, 
And I 
rapped at the back door; 
A man asked me what would I 
have, 
I 
told him I 
was hungry and poor. 
Said lie come in and take a 
seat, 
And he gave Inc bread and tea, 
He was a 
son of Erin's Isle, 
'foiling for his family. 
CHORUS , 
I 
shook his hand so hard and tough, . 
And the tears rolled fast down my face, 
May Heaven protect his good family, 
For you're welcome always at his place,

One summer's night ten years ago, 
The gang and brother Jim, 
Brought me down to the dock you know, 
To learn me how to swim. 
They tied a 
rope around my waist, 
And then they heaved me in, 
To tell the truth, I 
was nearly drowned, 
The night I 
learned to swim. 
CHORUS. 
Swim out, says Pete, arrah kick your feet, 
Go over- hand, says brother Jim, 
The gang did shout, as the dragged me out, 
The night I 
learned to swim. 
" " 
Chair roast beef, the beef is tough," 
The gang sung out to me; 
They daubed my face with lumps of tar, 
I 
looked like a 
Chine. 
I 
made back-dives, and sommer-saults, 
Along with Shorty Tim; 
Both my feet were cut with eopper nails, 
The night I 
learned to swim. 
I 
was chock fill of salt water, 
Brought to a 
liquor store, 
There they rolled me on a 
barrel, 
For two long hours or more. 
Sure they made me drink some brandy, 
I 
had the jim-jam-jims. 
I'll ne'er forget, as long as I 
live, 
The night I 
learned to swim.

For old Erin's Inys, brave soldier boys,

The winter has come on, the summer's past and gone, 
The streets and squares are covered with ice and snow, 
The people are wearing heavy woolen clothes, 
To keep themselves warm as they walk to and fro. 
It is easy for the rich that can afford it. 
To keep a 
warm carpet on their floor, 
In a 
soft cushioned chair by a 
bright fire they sit, 
And never once think of the pennilest and poi'. 
So every wealthy man, give charity when you can, 
And never turn a 
poor beggar from your door, 
But give him a 
piece of bread, and a 
place to lay his head, 
A 
blessing you'll receive from the penniless and poor. 
There's the poor working- man who works hard all the day, 
And supports his family by the sweat of his brow, 
He tries to save a 
few shillings from his pay, 
To •' lay in " coal and flour if his means will allow, 
Bright and early each morn to his work he does go, 
Toils with a 
will to keep the wolf from the door, 
Stout-hearted lie trudges along thro' the rain and snow, 
For he knows what it is to be penniless and poor. 
Chorus. 
And there's a 
poor widow who lives in a 
garret, 
Who goes out poor thing to wash and scrub all the week, 
With her small basket she visits the market, 
To buy food cheap'for the little ones she loves. 
She toils early and late to make up the month's rent, 
So the landlord will not turn her out of the door, 
For that is what he'd do if she owed him one cent, 
No feeling has he for the penniless and poor.

How often have we lingered 
There, together, you and 1, 
To one another told our love, 
When no one else was nigh. 
Ah! those happy days have fled, 
Like the waters of the rill, 
That glided by— with merry song— 
Ihe old bench near the will. 
CHORUS. 
The miller long has gone to rest, 
The clanking wheel hangs still, 
For everything has gone to ruin, 
But the old bench near the mill. 
Old winter's snows have come and gone, 
Spring bath decked with beauteous flowers, 
The trysting place where you and I 
Have passed such happy hours. 
Now I 
wander there alone, 
Yet fancy oft doth fill 
The spot where I 
have held thy form, 
On the old bench near the mill. 
Chorus. 
They tell me thou art gone my own, 
To a 
home beyond the skies, 
Gone where the stars are shining gold, 
Where friendship never dies. 
When the messenger doth come, 
To bid this heart be still. 
May we find in heaven another spot, 
Like the old bench near the mill.

On these soft and balmy evenings, 
When the stars are shining bright, 
To be wand'ring with your sweetheart, 
Is a 
source of great delight. 
Just one kiss and then another, 
For she must not stay out late, 
Oh ! those moments are so blissful, 
Breathing sweet words at the gate. 
Oh ! delicious hours of courtship, 
Loving smiles intoxicate, 
Rosy lips all ripe for kissing, 
Breathing sweet words at the gate. 
Sitting quiet in the arbor; 
Now a 
blush and then a 
sigh, 
Not a 
word above a 
whisper, 
Lest some poing one is nigh. 
Thro' the vines papa is peeping, 
And he could not help exclaim, 
Let the dear young ones enjoy it, 
For I 
once did just the same.

Deep sadness fills my aching heart, 
And tears unbidden flow, 
For on this day my infant died, 
This day one year ago. 
tender bud so beautiful, 
So fragile, pure and fair, 
Its fragrance far too sNveet to waste 
On earth's sin- tainted air. 
Through many sad long hours of pain, 
My precious darling lay ; 
Then God in swe.it compassion took, 
My little one away. 
As cold and rigid in my arms, 
His lifeless form was placed, 
Such agony of soul then felt, 
Can never be effaced. 
CHORUS. 
Baby died one year ago, to-day, 
Baby died one year ago, to-day, 
Baby died, baby died, 
Baby died one year ago, to-day. 
In meek submission how I 
bowed, 
To God's all- wise decree, 
He only took unto hi imself 
The one He gave to me. 
And yet I 
never see a 
babe, 
But sending tears will start, 
And kingly I 
crave to clasp 
My lost one to my heart. 
If I 
my future home could choose, 
In realms where glory reigns, 
I'd ask to dwell with angel babes, 
Ever singing heavenly strains ; 
For sadness fills my aching heart, 
And tears unbidden flow, 
For on this day my baby died, 
This day one year ago.

Early in the morn we started, 
With spirits light and gay, 
Shure the boys were all light-hearted, 
For it was New- Year's Day. 
We hired a 
new buffalo robe, 
And a 
big wash- tub sleigh, 
With an old lame mule inside the shafts, 
To make calls on New- Year's Day. 
CHORUS. 
Faix, up and down, all thro' the town, 
In a 
great big wash- tub sleigh, 
We'd sing a 
song as we drove along, 
Making calls on New- Year's Day. 
The very first call that we made, 
On " Mary Ann Kelioe," 
Mary Ann was scrubbing the stairs, 
It was her turn you know. 
When she saw the delegation, 
She raised the pail that way, 
Threw suds and soap on Burke's white duck vest, 
With compliments of the day. 
Chorus. 
On Dan " McCarthy's Boarding House," 
The second call we made, 
He treated us to whiskey sours, 
Snow-cake and lemon-aid. 
We ate a 
seven pound turkey, 
Each man drank a 
bowl of Lay, 
Buried Dan's wife to her neck in snow, 
In the yard on New- Year's Day. 
Chorus. 
We visited all our old friends, 
At moon-rise we were tight, 
We could not tell our own sur-names, 
We were near froze that night. 
Worst of all the last call we made, 
The mule he run away, 
Oh! we walked home on our hands and knees, 
And that wound up New-Year's Day.

Lonely and wears', poor, homeless, forsaken, 
Out in the cold bitter hours of the night, 
Wandering far away, while feud awaken, 
Dread of the fast coming sunbeams of light. 
Far from the home and the pleasures of childhood, 
With vile companions an exile from joy ; 
Longing once more for the charms of the wildwood, 
And for dear mother to welcome her boy.

Co for my boy for I 
know he's heart broken, 
Bring him once more to life's sunshine and joy, 
Thus in the old home a 
dear voicl has spoken, 
Mother is waiting to welcome her boy. 
Cold is the night , and the wintry wind blowing, 
Chills the poor wanderer, friendless, afar ; 
'While in the darkness, which way is he going? 
Must he repose ' neath the pale evening star ? 
Wine is a 
mocker, then why is he seeking, 
That which will mar his pure heart with ahoy, 
While a 
sweet voice now is tenderly speaking,

waiting to welcome her lay.

Mother is Waiting to Welcome her Boy. 
CONTINUED. 
Oh ! how she peers in the face of each stranger; 
Eager to see her boys smiles once again ; 
Lunging and praying to shield him from danger, 
Anxious to care for and soothe hitn in pain. 
Lone is the heart of that poor mother waiting. 
Wrinkled and gray, for one moment of joy ; 
While with his evil companions he's straying, 
Far from the mother who longs for her boy. 
Go for my boy, tic. 
Once he was pure as the babe in the manger, 
But friends were false, and they led him astray, 
Far from his home he Itas wandered a 
stranger, 
Reckless through drink, as you see him to-day! 
But who can tell how his heart has been saddened, 
When he has dreamed of lost friendship and joy, 
With no sweet thoughts when his brain has been maddened 
Mother would welcome her wandering boy. 
Go for my boy, tic. 
Go for my boy to-night! search through the city! 
Tell him that mother will never forget! 
Though he is fallen— oh ! bring him in pity, 
Back to the mother who loves her boy yet! 
Tell him she never will weary of prayirg 
For his return bringing sunshine and joy; 
Bear him this message, where'er he is straying, 
Mother is waiting to welcome her boy. 
Go for my boy, dm

I'm bothered, yes, I'm bothered, 
Completely perplexed ; 
I'm the father of a 
little boy, 
I'm not happy, but Pm vexed. 
I 
have ninety-nine relations, 
And they nearly drive me wild, 
. 
Both one and all, both great and small, 
They want to name the child. 
CHORUS. 
My wife she wants him Michael, 
Her sister wants him Matt, 
ricr brother wants him Charlie, 
Whilst her aunty wants him Pat. 
Whilst my mother wants him Shamus, 
And my father wants him Paul, 
I 
do declare, I 
don't know what, 
I'll name the child at all. 
'Twas only here this morning, 
My brother came from Troy. 
He swore by this, he swore by that, 
That he would name the boy. 
36 
I'll Name the Boy Dennis, or; no Name at all. 
CONTINUED. 
Says my wife's brother Darby, 
He be hanged if that would do, 
And they jumped together on the floor, 
And hada bold set- too. 
CHORUS. 
My wife she said it'll be Michael, 
Her sister said it'll be Matt, 
Her brother said it'll be Charlie, 
Whilst her aunt said no, it'll be Pat. 
Whilst her mother wants him Shamus, 
And my father wants him Paul, 
By heavens sure I 
don't know what 
I'll call the child at all, 
Next Sunday is the Christening, 
And I'll tell you by the way, 
I'll have none of their connivings, 
I'm bound to have my say. 
They may call him this, and call him that, 
I 
don't give that for their call, 
I'm bound to call him Dennis, 
Or he'll have no name at all. 
CHORUS. 
My wife may want him Michael, 
Her sister may want loin Matt, 
My brother he may want him Charlie,

My name it is Magown, 
From dear old Wexford town, 
'Tis there that I 
was bred and born; 
Where the grass grows so green. 
Fine sights are to be seen, 
On a 
beautiful summer's morn, 
But I 
wanted to roam, 
And leave my good old home, 
The passage my parents did pay, 
Shure they did sob and cry, 
When I 
bid them good-bye, 
And sailed for sweet Arnerikay. 
CHORUS. 
In the ship " Erin's Isle," 
I 
left my native soil, 
On the twenty-first of May; 
Sure my spirits were bright, 
Tho' my pockets were light, 
When I 
landed in sweet Amerikay. ( Dance.) 
They put me in a 
bunk 
No larger than a 
trunk ; 
'Tis there I 
slept the nights away, 
I 
got goo,' food to ate, 
Warm praties and cold mate, 
Three meals they gave me every day, 
On board was O'Reilly, 
And his large family. 
An uncle of Shamus O'Day, 
And jolly Rody Moore, 
MacMullins by the score ; 
All bound for sweet Amerikay. 
Chorus. 
It's in this big city, I 
have an aunt Kitty, 
She's married to Darby McQuade, 
'She lives on the first floor, 
has a 
bell to her door, 
Her husband is tailor by trade, 
She is a 
sweet eraythur, 
So full of good-naythur, 
At her house I 
intend to stay, 
And happy I 
will be, in the land of the free, 
My blessing to sweet Amerikay.

So make hay while the sun does shine, 
And remember the adage so often told,

For where there's a

And never put of till to- morrow,

Make most of all your youthful days, 
Ev'ry hour brings decline, 
Save the pennies, and dollars will soon be yours,

Sure we thot' we'd make a

And tell you all about the widow's party, 
'Twas at Paythogoras Hall, 
We gave a 
break- down ball, 
And invited all the young Elks gay and hearty, 
There was handsome Paddy Grace, 
Sure he's now on the police, 
He was put there by a 
pol-i-tic-al party. 
He came from County Cork, 
To the City of New York, 
He joked and sang and made us all feel hearty. 
CHORUs. 
Alt ! the charming Widow Clancy, 
She was any man's fancy, 
She was a 
fluent talker, and a 
rattling six-day walker, 
And a 
Venus is the charming Widow Clancy. 
McGinn sang Pin-a- fore, 
Till his throat was very sore, 
And " Little Dudeen," sang by Smith so sweetly, 
Crosby sang a 
little ditty, 
The girls all called hitu witty, 
And McGuffin done an Irish jig so neatly. 
Flynn sang, " Dancing on the green," 
Also " She's a 
fairy queen." 
Fluod sang " Hold the fort for we're the 
strongest party," 
And Murphy and Tim Lang, 
Done the Lack-a-‘%an-na Gang, 
Down at the charming Widow Clancy's party. Cho. 
As it was growing late, 
Sure we tho't was time to ate, 
We went in two by two's down to the supper, 
We were hardly seated right, 
When iht-re was a 
fearful fight, 
For MeGui-iness ewire the whiskey was all water, 
All around 'twas hand to hand, 
And they nearly killed the baud, 
When in stepped the famous boxer Mike McCarthy, 
He swore by the powers above, 
That he'd just put on the gloves, 
And clear out every sucker in the party.

Sure, I

It's one who at betting can win, 
Who on a

Whose pockets are loaded with ' tin." 
When I

He must with me exactly agree, 
And not care a

That's the kind of a

Fair as poets sweetest dream, 
With a

Throwing pebbles in the stream.

Laughing, blue-eyed, blushing Daisy, 
Fairer than my fondest dream, 
Beat me on that summer morning, 
Throwing pebbles in the stream. 
There we sat beside the brooklet, 
Flowing onward to the sea, 
And my heart first learned its secret, 
Daisy was so dear to me. 
Then I

With a

And I 
knew my love would beat me,

SAVE MY 
CHILD. • 
Words by Dr. Theo. D. C. Miller, Music by W. Warren Bentley. 
- 
When the Steamer Seawanhaka was burning, a 
mother stood 
amid the flames, clasping her little child with a 
dying grasp, 
and 
holding it over the vessels side as far from the flames as possible, 
though fatally burned and exhausted, and knowing that her last 
hour had come, she held her darling one, and in pleading accents 
cried, " Save my child !" 
one of the heroes of that hour, and or 
whose deeds will not soon be forgott en. 
MR. JOHN HENRY nesid, of 
larietn, N. Y. went to the relief of that agonized mother. Rowing 
his bo.tt close to the vessels side, he succeeded in taking the child 
from the dying grasp of the mother. 
Ills own person was 
severely burnei, and alth nigh suffering intensely', was able to res-
cue tvventy-one others. 
The mother uied immediately alter her 
rescue, and her darling one in two weeks.

As a

Sought her side through fire and pain, 
At the vessel's side she lingers, 
Robed in fierce and cruel-

Firmly all her fond heart claiMs.

TAKE ME IN YOUR ARMS, MAMA. 
BEAUTIFUL SONG AND CHORUS. 
On that dark, foggy night when the ill-fated steamer Narra-
gansett was sinking with its scores of precious souls, a 
lonely 
mother, traveling with her little child, was among those whose 
safety lay througa unknown perils. 
While she was preparing 
to leap from the burning wreck, her little child, with heartfelt 
pathos, cried, " OH, TAKE ME IN YOUR ARMS, MAMA !" 
She tried to brave the angry billows with her darling one; but, 
alas, her efforts were in vain. The arms that held the cherished 
one relaxed their loving embrace, and when again tht, mother 
beheld the little pieader the once bright . eyes were closed for-
ever. She had exchanged mother's love for that of the angels.

CHORUS. 
Darker grew the hours of waiting, 
With no ray of hope in sight, 
While the mother clasped her darling, 
In her arms of love that night. 
In the waves so tired and feeble, 
Struggling for her darling's sake, 
Was that mother weak and hop less, 
Praying for the dawn to break. 
But the arms that held her pleader, 
Soon relaxed fir strength had gone, 
And the mother broken-hearted, 
In her grief was all alone.

When the morning dawned in beauty, 
With the sun-beams clear and bright, 
She went home alone to papa, 
Leaving child and love that night. 
But she often hears her darling, 
In the heartfelt pleading tone, 
Take me in your arms, dear mamma, 
Words that come in dreams alone.

Give me back my dear old home that I 
used to love so well, 
In the dear old sunny south so far away, 
Where the breeze is softly sighing thro' the trees every night, 
And the mocking- bird sings s%%eet the livelong day. 
Take me back, oh! take me back to that old familiar spot, 
And thro' the cotton fields, oh! let me roam ; 
For, I'm old and feeble, and before I 
leave this land, 
Let me see once wore my dear old Southern home. 
CHORUS. 
Take me back, take me back, 
Take me back to my dear old southern home! 
Take me back, take me back, 
Take me buck to my dear old southern home. 
They were happy, happy times, at the old plantation home, 
When at night we would play the old banjo; 
I 
was a 
picaninny and my heart is light and gay, 
But the days tho' short they seem, are long ago. 
I've traveled the wide world o'er and in distant lands 
have roamed, 
But the dear old sunny south I 
love the best, 
Take me back and leave me there in my dear old 
southern home, 
In the dear sweet sunny south lay me to rest. 
Churns. 
We may never meet again for my time is drawing near, 
When I'll have to leave this world for evermore ; 
So then take me back to die in the dear old sunny south, 
Where my wife and children have been laid before. 
Old maisa and old missus they w 
re always kind to me, 
But they've both gone to the better land I 
know, 
Where no care, no grief, nor pain, comes to cloud 
their aged brow, 
To that bright and happy land I 
long to go.

Where the softest breezes rustle, 
Through the fields of nodding rye, 
And the brightest sunbeams glimmer, 
In the azure- tinted sky ; 
Dwells a 
maiden •
 pure and lovely, 
As she gleans the golden grain ; 
One as blooming as the roses, 
Bright and winsome Winnie Wane. 
CHORUS. 
At the bright dawn of the morning, 
Or when twilight shades the plain, 
You may see our queen of roses, 
Bright and winsome Winnie Wane. 
Hearts were made for joy and sorrow, 
For life's sunshine and its gloom, 
And sweet Winnie in her gladness 
Rivals all that's bright in bloom. 
She is kind to those that suffer, 
And they never ask in vain, 
For the words of love and pity, 
From the lips of Winnie Wane. 
Would you know our fondest treasure, 
Who is fairest of the fair, 
Go among the poor and lowly, 
You will ever find her there. 
Touching brightly brows of sorrow, 
Soothing hearts that throb with pain, 
While the sunbeams fall in beauty, 
O'er our winsomo. Winnie Wane.

We're both growing aged together, 
And Jennie has left the old farm ; 
To walk by the side of another, 
As on in life's journey they roam, 
And John who was tender and loving, 
Has gone in the pathwhy to harm; 
And left his old parents in sorrow, 
To suffer or mortgage the tarm. 
CHORUS. 
It's sad to be aged and feeble, 
And know that this life has no charms, 
But when in old age we are childless, 
How painful to mortgage the farm, 
But when in old age we are childless, 
How painful to mortgage the farm. 
We thought John would be our protection, 
For he was so kind when a 
boy; 
And Betsey so gentle and loving, 
Would call him a mother's fond joy. 
But he was led off by companions, 
In ways that bring evil and harm ; 
And left his old parents in sorrow, 
To suffer or mortgage the farm. 
It's hard to be luveless and childless, 
When wrinkles are deep on the brow; 
And hair has grown aged and whitened, 
With footsteps so tottering now. 
But when we are feeble and helpless, 
With none to protect us from harm; 
We only can suffer in silence, 
Or tearfully mortgage the farm.

Once upon a 
time there lived a 
maiden, 
In a 
little cottage by the sea ; 
Twining round about, it heavy laden, 
Grew a 
honev-suelde fair to see; 
And the maiden watched the blossoms daily, 
heard the bees about it as it grew, 
Bent above it singing ever gaily, 
Every bud rind every blossom knew, 
When the wind a 
leaf blew down, 
Cattle a 
sudden dainty frown; 
Jealous was the maid I 
trow. 
Greater love she did not know, 
No! greater love she did not know, 
Know, know, know, know. 
To the maiden came one day a 
lover, 
Tall and brave, and full of manly grace s 
Whispering tender words he bent above her. 
Stooped and kissed her sunny smiling fans.. 
Underneath the honey- suckle walked they, 
But her Ei,es were cast demurely down; 
Seeing not as softly, sweetly talked they, 
How its leaves were turning sere and brow& 
Withered now its tendrils twine, 
Bird and bee have left the vine. 
Careless is the maid I 
trow, 
Greater love bath learned to know, 
No! greater love bath learned to know, 
Know, know, know, know.

On the bridge that crosses the brook.

Joys of my childhood are now gone forever, 
Bright hours of the past I 
shall never more see, 
Flowers of the wild wood and home by the river, 
Yes gone are the joys that were once dear to me. 
Rocks that I 
loved in the days of my childhood, 
And brooklets by whose peaceful waters I'd play, 
While watching the sunbeams which brightened the wildwood, 
Live only in memories chambers to- day. 
CHORUS. 
Joys of my childhood are now gone forever, 
Bright hours of the past I

Flowers in the wild wood and liwne by the nv r, 
Yes, gone are the joys that were once dear to me. 
Hours of my childhood come back in my dreaming, 
Once more in my fancy I 
see vale and hill, 
That flowing stream let whose waters were gleaming, 
While leaping o'er cascades to run the old mill. 
Forest of oaks where the sweet birds were singing, 
And roses abloom 'neath the fair summer sky, 
In dreams of the past sweet remembrance is bringing, 
Of days I 
onc e cheri

e 
Days of my childhood I 
love to remember, 
Bright hours of the past with their merry good cheer ; 
Bloom of the valley from May to December, 
The snow flakes which heightened the r.ist of the year. 
Then in the fall, picking apples so golden, 
Or making the sugar when springtime had come, 
We love to recount jcys of childhood so olden, 
When sunbeams shine brightly on dear ones at home. 
Clio 
Gone are the days that my heart fondly cherished, 
And past are the charms I 
would love to recall ; 
Dear is the thought that when childhood's joys perished, 
The bliss of remembrance was left to us all 
Now as down life's winding pathway I 
wander, 
My memory cling , to its past treasures yet. 
The sunshine which brightened iny chikl hood's home yonder, 
Chorus. 
And friends ever patient I 
cannot forget.

Sweetly in the twilight dancing, 
Fairy-like with form entrancing, 
Cunning elf with mischief glancing, 
Little roguish eyes ; 
O'er the dew with lightness creeping, 
While the glow-worm soft is sleeping, 
And the blight stars forth are peeping, 
Peeping with surprise. 
As she wanders through the dell, 
Hushed is every birdie's song, 
For each songster knows full well, 
She rules the warbling throng. 
Brighter seems the day declining, 
As with sunlight still combining, 
Where her gleam o'er all is shining, 
Little roguish eyes. 
Blithely in the eariy morning, 
Summer day is gently dawning, 
Lifting night's be-darkened awning, 
Little roguish eyes ; 
As she wades the brooklet flowing, 
Moves amid the violets growing, 
Not a 
thought on one bestowing, 
Which around her lies. 
May her future life be pure. 
May her sweetness never fade, 
May g,riin sorrow lie'er seCilre, 
My own dear mountain maid. 
Joy o'er all my darling flinging, 
Hear the lark her praises singing, 
For to all sweet mirth she's bringing, 
Little roguish eyes.

THE DAY I

You may think that I 
am mad, 
But I 
only feel so sad, 
The reason I 
will tell you every one; 
I 
courted a 
nice young girl, 
Whose name was Peggy Doyle, 
And I 
brought her to Coney Isle to have some fun. 
She is from the County Down, 
And she weighed two hundred pound, 
And I 
thought that she'd be true to me all the while. 
But if I 
had to do it again, 
She would never go to swim 
Along with me down to Coney Isle. 
CHORUS. 
She had salt water sure, galore, 
And she swallowed a 
quart or more, 
And the gang upon the beach began to smile, 
'I hey all did wave their hats, 
And shouted " float her pat," 
The day I 
brought My Peg to Coney Isle. 
Now its when we reached the pier, 
We went and had some beer, 
And after that we went and had a 
bathe, 
You may talk about your fat woman 
That traveled with liarnum's show, 
But you ought to see my Peg upon the waves. 
The gang commenced to guy us, 
My bosom was on fire. 
When the gang gave to me a 
grand hurray, 
When a 
lad with a 
crooked mouth, 
"Beheave us" shouted out, ( Chorus. 
There's one of the sea lions that escaped the other day, 
Of course I 
did feel mad, after listening to that lad, 
Of course he thought that he was awful smart, 
But if I 
had him in New York 
Up near the Central Park, 
You cau bet your life that I 
would break his heart, 
I 
don't say Pm a 
fighter, a 
cutter or a 
biter 
But I 
can taka my own part all the while 
Arrah-musha bad luck to Peg, she will stand 
upon her head, 
Before I 
bring her again to Coney Isle. 
Chorus.
