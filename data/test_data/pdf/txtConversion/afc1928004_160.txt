Lalla Rookh — Ali Pacha's 
Twenty Wives. 
Words by J. Foster. 
Music by II. Tissingtotr 
:HERE was Ali Pacha, he'd twico 
ten wives, 
.And once in a 
terrible passion— 
From the score complete he required. 
their lives 
In a 
very odd. sort of a 
fashion— 
In a 
muddy pond he the ladies pop't, 
While a 
legion of frogs there wa-s 
croaking; 
The water ran deer, at the bottom they 
.stop-t, 
Oh I 
what a 
IIindoo method of joking. 
Mild Mustaphey Bey had a 
gentle mode, 
He began by a 
sample of banging; 
And then if his charmers restive rode, 
Why he finished the matter by hang-
ing— 
8 • 
A 
nice silken cord to each lonely bride, 
And thus on the system of choking, 
By tying one knot he another untied; 
Oh! what a 
Hindoo method of joking. 
Had I 
twenty wives would I 
treat them 
so, 
Tho' twenty times more plague than 
pleasure, 
I'd give them wings, let nineteen of 
them go, 
One sweet little pet, my heart's treas-
ure, 
Oh! Leskar, dear Leskar, not a 
hair of 
your head 
Should he hurt were you always pro-
vokin 
Dear dimpled face rogue, better living 
than dead, 
We'd have no Hindoo method of jok-

The Perils of Flirting. 
DUETTO IN 4TH ACT. 
Words by J. Foster. 
Music by H. Tissingtom 
Pinion, solo : 
---1F a 
woman tells truth she will never 
deny 
Of that which I 
feel to be certain, 
That she loves for her charms to make 
the men sigh, 
6 
And doats in her heart upon flirting. 
4 
With a 
glance to encourage, a sigh to 
respond, 
Then a 
sweet trepidation, but nothing 
beyond, 
Oh! yes, you women, you doat upon 
flirting. 
10 
Leskar: 
Oh, yes, .flirting to all can a 
pleasure 
impart, 
Tho' some may perhaps think it cruel, 
Yet I'm sure ' tis nothing but touching 
a 
heart, 
Or getting you shot in a 
duel. 
With a glance to encourage, a 
sigh to 
respond, 
As you say, trepidation, but nothing be-
ypnd, 
Oh! yes, we wonvni, we clout upon flirt-

Denny Blake from County 
,Clare  
And here at your command, 
To sing a 
song in praise of home, 
And my own native land ; 
I've saird to foreign countries 
And in many climes lye been, 
But my heart is still with Erin, 
Where the grass grows green, 
love my native country, 
I'm loyal to my Queen; 
But I 
can't forget " Quid Erin," 
Where the grass grows green. 
Poor Pat is often painted, 
With a 
ragged coat and hat, 
Rig heart and and hospitality, 
Have much to do with that; 
22 
Let slanderers say what they will, 
They cannot call him mean, 
Sure a 
stranger's always welcome 
Where the grass grows green. 
I 
love, &c. 
He's foolish but not vicious, 
His faults I 
won't defend, 
His purse to help the orphan, 
His life to serve a 
friend; 
He'll give without a 
murmur, 
So his follies try and screen, 
For there's noble hearts in Erin, 
Where grass grows green.. 
I 
love, &e. 
'Tis true he has a 
weakness, 
For drops of something pure, 
But that's a 
slight lebility, 
That many more endure; 
4 
23 
Ue's fond of fun, he's witty, 
Tho' his wit is not too keen, 
For there's feeling hearts in Erin, 
Where the grass grows green. 
I 
love, tc.e. 
There's not a 
true born Irishman, 
Wherever he may be, 
But loves the little Emerald, 
That sparkles on the sea; 
May the sun of bright prosperity, 
Shine peaceful tuld. serene, 
And bring better days to Erin, 
Where the grass grows green. 
I 
love, & e.

Where man ev'ry joy upon earth may

Sure I've roam'd the world over from 
Dublin to Dover, 
But in all the strange countries whet.. 
ever I've been, 
I 
ne'er saw an island on sea or on dry

That's where You Make the 
Mistake. 
As Sung by Gin Williams. 
OME folks think the:4're awfully 
clever, 
That all other folks are but fools, 
Some people will often endeavor, 
To make other people their tools. 
Sonie people will boast of their know-
ledge, 
And fancy they're well wide awake. 
That none are so deep or so cute- as 
themselves. 
That's where they make the mistake.

There's just as good fish in the sea

As those we have managed to take, 
So don't be too proud, and don't

For that's where you make the mis. 
take.

Don't imagine you'll meet a

Don't imagine you'll find a

Declare that his fish are not sweet; 
Do not fancy you'll meet with a 
hack-
man, 
Who more than his fare will not take, 
as well think an oyster could crawl 
up a 
tree, 
And there you would make a 
mistake. 
Ef you fancy a

small kiss. 
You must be what some folks call t,

You may as well think that a

Has often a

You'll oft see a 
swell, all collar and

To his finger tips white as snow flake, 
But if you believe he's all over alike, 
That's where you'll make the mistake, 
The ladies still wear an abundence of

But if you imagine they grow it them-

When away from her I

I

But her bright, sweet smile can ever

In her hair she wears a

- As blithe as blithe can be; 
For let the times be good. or bad, 
They're all the same to me; 
'Tis little of the world I 
know, 
And care less for its ways; 
For where the dog- star never glows,

How little do the great ones care— 
Who sit at home secure— 
What hidden dangers colliers dare, 
What hardships they endure 
The very fires their mansions boast 
To cheer themselves and wives, 
Mayhap were kindled at the cost 
Of jovial collier's lives. 
Down in a

Then cheer up, lads, and make ye much 
Of every joy ye can: 
But let your mirth be always such 
As best becomes a

However fortune turns about, 
We'll still be jovial souls, 
For what would nations be without 
The lads that look for coals? 
Down in a

My hands are horny, hard and black 
With working in the vein; 
And, like the clothes upon my back, 
My speech is rough anti plain: 
Well, if I 
stumble with my tongue, 
I've one excuse to say— 
'Tis not the collier's heart that's wrong, 
'Tis the head that goes astray. 
Down in a

At every shift, be't soon or late,

As sung by aus 
MERICA is my nation, 
Humble is my station, 
A 
grocer by situation, 
0 how shall I 
explain; 
Well I 
loved a 
girl called Kitty, 
Who sells apples in the city, 
On me she'll not take pity, 
Her love I 
tried to gain; 
I've asked her in marriage 
I've a 
donkey and a 
carriage, 
And I'd take her out to Harlem, 
If she'd but name the day. 
But now she goes each morning, 
A.nd thro' the streets she's hauling 
A 
hand-truck, and loudly calling, 
*In a 
voice so loud and high, 
Apples ripe and rosy, 
Here's your fine strawberry, 
Damson plums, and cherries, 
You can taste before you buy. 
I 
oft at market meet her, 
And with smiles I 
greet her, 
And then I 
wish to treat her— 
As one that I 
love dear; 
And if I 
do tell her 
Of some bargains I 
ccfuld soil her. 
A 
nasty low lifed fellow, 
Says what do you want here. 
And if to her I'm speaking, 
Perhaps with fond words greeting, 
.This fellow's always sneaking, 
And ov'ry word will hear. 
And now she goes, &o.. 
I 
made up my mind one morning, 
-Upon this fellow calling, 
To tell him of my falling, 
In love with Kitty dear. 
Well I 
did repent it, 
For he raised his fist and seni it 
On my nose and bent it, 
What shall I 
do'? oh dear 
For her I'm always fretting, 
The tears my eyes are wetting, 
So I'll drown my woes in betting, 
For I've always in my ear 
So now she goes, &c.

WHICH HUNG IN THE WELL. 
ow dear to this heart are the scenes of 
my childhood, 
• When fond recollection recalls them to view 
The orchard, the meadow, the decp-tangled 
wildwood, 
And every loved spot which my infancy 
knew; 
The wide-spreading pond, and the mill which 
stood by it, 
The bridge, and the rock where the cataract 
I fell, 
The cot of my father, the dairy house nigh it 
The old oaken bucket—the iron-bound bucket 
The moss-covered bucket, which hung in the 
well. 
That moss-covered vessel I 
hail as a 
treasure, 
For, often, at noon, when return'd from the 
a 
field, 
T. found it the source of an exquisite pleasure, 
The purest and sweetest that nature can

Mother watched him from the ATI-) • 
These the only words he said: 
Let me pray before I 
die. 
Pale aT 'earful all around, 
Hushed the noise of breeze and wave; 
Cords are brought, his hands are bound, 
All are silent as the grave. 
Mild blue eyes are raised in prayer, 
• 
Death and parting bring no sigh; 
Please one moment do but spare, 
Let me pray before I 
die. 
Softened thus the sailor stood; 
Lc)! he heeds that pleading form. 
Brave his heart, so kind and good, 
Brightly fell the tear drops warm. 
Swiftly he flew, as ocean birds, 
There around. the joyful cry, 
Kissed the lips that breathed the words, 
me pray before I 
die.

Gone the happy smile.

(
Translated.) 
OME, children of your country, 
come, 
Now glory dawns upon the world, 
Oar tyrants, rushing to their doom, 
Their crimson standard have unfurl'd, 
already on our plains we hear, 
The murmurs of a 
savage horde; 
They threatened with the murd'rous 
sword, 
Your comrades and your children dear.

hen up, and from your ranks, 
The hireling foe withstand; 
March on, march on, his craven blood 
Must fertilize the land 
so 
Then tremble tyr..nt—traitors-----all— 
Ye whom both friends and roes do 
spise, 
Oil you shall retribution fall, 
Your crimes shall gain a 
worthy prize. 
Each man opposes might to might, 
And When our youthful heroes die, 
Our France can well their place supply, 
We're soldiers all with you to fight. 
Then up, cc:c. 
Come, love of country, guide us now, 
Endow our vengeful arms with might, 
And dearest liberty do thou 
Aid thy defenders in the fight, 
Unto our flag let victory 
Called by thy stirring accents, haste, 
And may thy dying foes at last 
Thy triumph and thy glory see.

NOT FOR JOSEPH. 
SUNG ET TEl CELEBRATED CHARLIE VITLA.X. 
'VE seen a 
bit of gaiety throughout ray 
short career; 
I, once, was foolish with my tin, but I 
have paid most dear. 
If folks would seek to take me in, they find it 
is no go; 
I'm up to almost every thing: 
You cant't get 
over Joe. 
CHORUS. 
• 
Oh! dear no! not for Joe—if he knows it—not 
for Joseph. 
Oh! no, no! not for Joe—not for Joseph: oh! 
dear, no! 
The other day, I 
met a 
friend, we passed the 
time of day, 
And chatted gaily down Broadway; but ere I 
went away, 
I 
kindly asked the learned swell to take a 
part-
ing drain. 
Oh! yes, said he, I 
think I 
will: then let It be 
champagne. 
SPOKEN—No, you don't, my dear fellow, you 
don't get champagne out of Joseph 
! 
no! no, no! etc. 
Some time ago, a 
friend of mine, he asked 
me out to dine, 
And there he introduced me to one he called 
diviao

she'd mal?..e a 
charming wife, Lnd had 
such lots of tin : 
A widow only forty-two: go in, my boy, and 
win ! 
SPOKEN—Matrimony and lots of money, and 
a 
widow only forty- two-;-
well, the money 
Very good, but then— the widow. 
Oh ! dear, no! etc. 
Of late, in town, there was a 
fuss about the 
'kips so grand : 
And, also, of 
the Russians who visited our 
land: 
And then the country companies we greet with 
hearty cheers, 
We know they have been received well by the 
New York Volunteers. 
SPOKEN—What a 
glorious thing it !s 
to fight 
and die for your country ! 
What can be more 
glorious than a 
bullet in ymr eve ? 
What can 
be more painful than a 
bullet in the eye? Noth-

Oh ! dear, no! etc.

I 
paddle my own canoe.

But you'll find it better by far in the end,

To borrow is dearer by far than to buy, 
A 
maxim, though old, still true; 
You never will sigh if you only will try, 
To paddle your own canoe. 
Then love your, etc.

And gaze upon the fashion, 
always see in merry glee 
The pretty girls so dishing; 
And as I 
get around them 
They greet we with a 
smile, 
But none among them pleases me, 
For Ella is my style.

She is so gayly dressed, 
She's my sweetness, she's my peach, 
When on me she throws a

There is no one to watch I.Ar, 
For Ella is my style. 
The first time tint I 
met her 
It was at a

The moon was shining brightly, 
T'was then I

If I

Have Faith in One Another. 
-7ave faith in one another, 
When ye meet in friendship's name, 
For the true friend is a 
brother, 
And his heart should throb the same, 
Though your path in life may differ, 
Since the hour when first ye met, 
have faith in one another 
Ye may need that friendship yet. 
Have faith in one another, 
When ye whisper love's fond vow : 
'Twill not be always summer 
Nor be always bright as now. 
And when winter time comes o'er thee, 
If some kindred heart ye share, 
And have faith in one another, 
Ye shall never more despair 
Have faith in one another, 
For should doubt alone incline, 
It would make the world a 
desert, 
Where the sun would never shine; 
We have all some transient sorrow, 
That o'er shadows us to day, 
But have faith in one another 
And it soon will pass away 
Have faith in one another, 
And let honor be your guide; 
And let truth alone be spoken, 
Whatsoever may be tide. 
The false may reign a 
season, 
And oh! doubt not that it will, 
But have faith in one another 
And tlie truth shall triumph still.

A ROGUISH BOY IS LOVE . 
Sung by Rount HOWARD. 
ad and sweet is love I 
What so sad and sweet? 
Mingled smiles and tears 
Make our lives complete. 
Love is either sighing, 
Pining, almost dying, 
Or he's gaily smiling, 
Merry hours beguiling. 
Hey ho I 
Hey ho very sad and sweet is love 
Hey ho! Hey ho I 
a 
roguish boy is love. 
When we seek the boy 
He is sure to fly I 
When we bid him go 
Then he lingers nigh I 
Ever more perplexing, 
Puzzling, too, and vexing, 
Who would care about him, 
Could we do without him ? 
Hearts go pitapat 
When he wanders near 
When he speeds away. 
Don' t 
we sigh and fear 
Pouting and coquetting, 
Into mischief getting, 
Oh! this naughty cupid 
Makes a 
body stupid.! 
Hey ho & c. 
Hey ho; ke.;

ssy, 
me crazy, 
Well bright blue eyes all men surprise ; 
Like diamonds on a 
daisy; 
By a 
Queen I'm lov'd as you know, 
Her name it is Queen Juno, 
My little heart from her won't part 
She's such a 
lovely girl. 
Oh a 
pair of bright eyes are the thing for nae, 
And we know they are such pretty things to see, 
When we are married oh how happy. we shall be, 
Among the upper ten how envied I 
shall be. 
Reposing on the flowers, 
Near the celestial bowers, 
I 
was made to start by Cupid's dart 
And thro' a 
golden shower, 
While feigning to be sleeping 
I 
saw my Juno peeping, 
'Mid the sunlit skies her bight blue eyes 
Said mortal I 
love you. 
Oh a 
pair, 40. 
EVERYBODY'S FRIEND. 
Sung by- the GREAT LIN G 
ARD. 
1. happy careless chap tun I, mid boast where e'er I 
go, 
That tho' I 
have made many friends, I've not a 
single foe. 
To be a 
genius I 
do not and never did pretend, 
But move in good society, as eYety body's friend. 
BteLoGuE—" And having lots of cash..". 
CHOuus—They take me tor a 
millionaire, my cash I 
freely 
spend, 
And so I'm welcom'd every where as every body's friend. 
A 
mother once with sixteen girls, to me thus did apply, 
Watch and protect my darling dears, so timid, young ani 
City. 
She said tho' once I 
really thought you marriage did intend, 
Then a 
breach of promise action brought ' gainat every body's 
friend. 
DIALOG E—" Verdict in her favor. Damages $ 10,000." 
MORAL— Avoid mothers with sixteen grown up, gushing 
daughters ; for, in their desperation to get them 
off their hands,they ' lido anything; especially if— 
CHOUUS— They take me, itc. 
A 
marriedman said,"Jack,my wife and I 
do'nt quite agree," 
The wife she whisper'd in my car, " Ile treats me shame-
fully." 
I 
gave the best advice to each, and of course, why in the 
end, 
They made it up, and kicked me out, and now I'm neither's 
friend. 
DisnoGnst--The husband was indignant, because I 
took her 
part ; and the wife, precisely fur the same rea-
son, called me a " nasty ,a- retch." But I 
don't 
care, for— 
Csit3P.us----They take me, &w. 
A 
friend of mine once bought a 
house somewhere close to Rye, 
And meeting me one day, said he, " A fool I 
was to buy, 
The walls are damp, the windows shake, and burglars oft 
attend. 
Dear Jack, do take it off my hands, you're every body's 
fi iend." 
• 
DIALO,it:E—I did, and I 
liad'nt been in the house three 
nights, betn:e the burglars broke in, and took 
every stick I had; and the last ruffian, as he 
descended the stairs, and got outside of the 
hou-e, looked up to me, at the window, and said: 
" 
I 
say, old boy,"— 
CHORUS- We took 
ou fur a 
millidnaire, your cash we'll 
freely spend, 
And so ye:1'i

As sung by Al!. Niles at Davis' 'Music Halt. 
ood evening folks, we've come to sing a 
littla 
song, 
And tell you about that gal who dresses so gay, 
In Central Park I

They say she is the beauty of Broadway. 
Should like an introduction to, that pretty gal 
dressed up in blue, 
And they say her name is Susina May, 
Oh, how my heart does beat, as I

With this pretty little beauty of Broadway. 
Uer pretty coal black eyes, like stars are in the

They stal'd this darkey's gizzard right away 
I 
followed her a

pleasant smile, 
From that pretty little beauty of Broadway.

WHEN WE WERE BOYS TOGETHER, 
IS forty years, my old friend, John, 
Since you and I 
were young, 
Bird-nesting 
through 
each forest 
glen, 
What merry, merry lays we've sung. 
We've climbed the rugged mountain Eide, 
And culled the bright topped heather, 
Methinks it seems but yesterday 
Since we were boys together. 
CHORE'S. 
Since we were boys, merry merry boys, 
Since we were boys together; 
Methinks it seems but yesterday, 
Since we were boys together. 
There's gladness in remembrance, John, 
Our friendship has been true, 
In all the weal and woe of life, 
No change that friendship knew; 
We've missed some loved ones, one by one, 
And turned our wreaths of heather, 
in fancy as we've decked their tombs, 
Since we were boys together. 
Since we were boys, etc. 
I 
need not bid thee ponder, john, 
Yon know our prime is o'er, 
The flower, the nest, the humming bee, 
For us will charm no more ; 
And our frail form is fading fast, 
We cannot bind the heather, 
s 
hand in hand, with gladsome brow, 
We did when boys together. 
When we were boys, etc,

GOOD-BYE JOHN. 
feTrrwas on a 
Friday morning I 
xBid Gotham City good-4e, 
The wind it blow'd great guns, my boys. 
And the water ran sky high. 
As .1 
waved my new Bandana, to 
INly Nancy on the shore, 
She sobb'd and sigh'd and wept and cried, 
I'Vhen I 
sailed for Singapore. 
SPOKEN—Ay, lads, and weepingly she cried, 
cuonzs. 
Good bye, John, now don't stop long, 
But come back soon to your own Chickabiddy. 
For my heart beats so, when the winds do blow, 
That takes away my sailor. 
Sweet Nancy was a 
lass,my boys, 
Of fiftecen stone full weight, 
Her face— it was a 
face, my boys, 
Like a 
good size dinner plate. 
She kept a 
sweet-stuff shop, my boys, 
"rwould your eyes do good to see, 
sold Loll:Tops and Tom Thumb's drops, 
But nought so sweet as she. 
SPOKEN—And her last words were 
Good-bye, John, (!ce. 
When I 
saii'd for foreign parts I'd bring 
Back presents to my love, 
• 
Stich lnjin Hats and Turkish Mats, 
Or a 
Chinese Turtle Dove. • 
Sweet Nancy would write me billey doos,-
Which took away my breath, 
She said as how she loved her John, 
With kind rey'ards till death. 
So loving. 
SPOKEN.—And at the bottom of the billy doox 
she used to put P. S. 
Good-bye, John, &c. 
• 
110 
One night I 
had a 
dream, my boys, 
That Nancy appeared to me, 
She look'd just like a 
mermaid, boys, 
What floats about the sea, 
She wagg'd her tail at me, my boys, 
And then she shook her head, 
Then seem'd to speak in fishy tones, 
And this is what she said, 
Good-bye, John, iSac 
Our gallant craft reach' d 
home, my boys: 
Next day to come on board, 
My Nance put off in a 
boat to meet, 
Her John whom she ador'd, 
When messuiates—hard the tale to tell, 
She swerved, the boat capsized, 
Down, down to the bottom went sweet Nance, 
Thezirl I 
dearly priz'd. 
SPOKEN.—Ali, 
lads, there struggling in the 
embrace of the briny Thames I 
beheld rely own 
sweet Nance—and was I 
a 
British Sailor to stand 
by and sec a 
British female—and that female a 
women in distress? 
No 1 
to shiver my timbers, 
take a 
reef out of my slacks, and the quid out of 
my mouth, was but the work of three-quarters 
of an hour, and overboard I 
dived—when huzzar! 
just as she was sinking for the thirtieth time I 
grasped her by the hair—the locks I 
loved so 
dear. ‘.‘ Saved ! Saved !" I 
cried, when horror ! 
her hair came off! she never told me she wore a 
wig—and down she went gurgling the words I 
hear in every wind that blows— 
Good-bye John, &c.

BE QUIET, OR I'LL SCREAM. 
NE bright midsummer's eve, 
With Barry by my side, 
As we went strolling forth, 
I 
fancied that he sighed; 41
1 
His arm around my waist, 
With joy his eyes did beam, 
He asked a 
kiss—says I, 
"Be quiet, or I'll scream." 
We reached my cottage door, 
lie bade me there good-bye, 
My heart rebuked me then, 
I 
thought of his*deep sigfi; 
So smiling at my beau, 
Who rather glum did seem, 
Says I, " Love, take a 
kiss, 
I 
never meant to scream." 
We tread the same old path, 
Though years I've been a 
wife, 
Our days glide on in bliss, 
We know no care or strife; 
The walks are just the same, 
The moon as bright doth beam, 
But if he failed to kiss, 
Oh dear! how I 
should scream.
