Mr. Harold Spivacke
Library of Congress, Washington, D. C.
Merryville, La. 5/18/39
Dear Mr. Spivacke:
I am assuming that you are sending the records to Merryville, La. My next address is Pine
Bluff, Ark.; next Sunday and Monday, Parchman, Miss.; next Livingston, Ala. c/o Mrs.
Tartt. Fifty-four records sent to you from Huntsville. The day of shipment being Sunday
the Express office was not open. A friend misunderstood my directions and on Monday
shipped them C.O.D. $500. His order should read charges collect. All goes well.
Miss T. and Jno. Lomax
