We Are Gwine Away. 
Written by C. H . 
SHEFFER, and sung with great success by FOLEY and 
SHEFFER. 
Oh, good evening white folks, one and all, 
We ask your attention for awhile; 
We'll sing and dance and do the best we can, 
We hope you'll like our old plantation style, 
Down on the Mississippi, where we were bred and born. 
But now we're gwine away, 
We ain't got long to stay, 
So fare you well white folks, one and all. 
How often we'd go up on the deck, 
'Twas then the moon was shining brigh: ; 
We sang dar our good old nigger songs, 
And den we jump and dance with all our might. 
The white folks used to laugh, and clap their hands so loud, 
They'd make us sing and dance again, 
Then didn't we feel proud. 
CHORUS. 
But bow we're gwine away, 
Wc ain't got long to stay, 
So fare you well white folks, one and all.

FOLEY in " Uncle Ike's Jubilee." 
A 
happy colored man am 1, just three score years I've seen, 
I 
am known about the village here as Uncle Isaac Green. 
Though old in years, my heart is young ; it won't be long 
before 
The gospel train will come along, bound for the other shore. 
CHORUS. 
I 
am Uncle Isaac Green, just three score years I've seen ; 
Though old in years I'm young at heart. I 
am Uncle Isaac 
Green, 
When the horn does blow the work am done, the niggers 
they all throng 
To our cot down in the lane to hear a 
good old song, 
But Gabriel soon will blow his horn, and tell us " all aboard;" 
How happy we will be that morn' in the army of the Lord.

Words by HARRY BENNETT. 
Music by BILLY CARTER. 
KEEP your eyes upon us. children from the South. 
We're as merry as the little birds singing on the trees: 
our hair's so tight we cannot shut our mouth, 
And we're always just as happy as can be. 
Then, (lancing, laughing. jumping all the day, 
Music makes us foolish as the chickens in the hay. 
Then singing,. shouting, to pass the time away. 
We're two happy little children from the South. 
When us darkeys we give it fancy ball, 
They watch us niggers as we promenade the hall; 
Singing, (lancing, we can beat them all. 
For we're two happy litttle children from the South. 
Then dancing, laughing etr.

BEAUTIFUL PINK AND WHITE ROSES. 
DOWN ON THE MISSISSIPPI SHIM 
Words and music written by W. 11. DELEHANTY. 
A s 
the merry birds that warble in the trees, 
Or the wild flowers that scent the summer breeze, 
As I 
wander here and there, aithout a 
thotOtt of care, 
My happiness does every hour increase. 
How sweet :%e 
love and be loved in return, 
When modest maiden cheeks begin to burn. 
And eyes of diamond light outshine the glare at night 
To wake from blissful dreams at early dawn. 
Oh dear? the ',ender passion love, 
How beautiful bewildering you seem ! 
Like a 
boon descending from above, 
Elisum the .:e,pturz_ of e, dream. 
Ohl brisht and merry pasr the hours away, 
And time but 
noment?, ,;
lacl and gay, 
As I 
wan ler '-hc grove to sin 
of her I 
love. 
And like the birds I 
carol forth my lay. 
Beautiful pink and white roses. 
Culled from 3 arden of posies. 
Loy°ly verdant ';ein so rich and rare, 
how sweetly you deck my darling's hair : 
You linger in my mind as something good and kind, 
Because you make my darling twice as fair. 
There's an ivy-covered cottage in the lane 
With its rustic little portico slain ; 
A charming little spot, a 
lovely garden plot 
Where every kind, of flowers bloom amain ; 
But the pride of all the garden is the rose 
Which here.and there in great profusion grows. 
The lovely violet and fragrant mignonette, 
There is none of them such beauty can disclose; 
But fairer far is Flora's face •,,nsee, 
It piereed mc into my very soul 
The day she pulled those pretty flowers for me 
And pinned them in my button-hole, 
Ohl since that time I 
placed them in my book, 
Where now and then my eye with rapture look; 
They make my heart rejoicc 
know they were her choice, 
The roses pink and white from her .1 
took.

Way down in Georgia, upon the old plantation, 
There's where to live to be happy, light and free; 
And when our work was over, we had a

And with the nigger wenches we had a

Off for Georgia before the break of day.

As sung by T. M. liENGLEB. 
I 
am growing old and feeble, 
My hair is turning gray ;

Are stiff, and won't obey. 
My dancing days are over, 
My pleasures are all gone; 
For goodness, not for greatness, 
You'll miss me when I'm gone.

When I'm gone, you will miss me; 
When I'm gone, you will miss me ;

When I'm gone, you will miss me; 
When I'm gone, you will miss me ; 
There is one kind heart will miss me, when I'm gone. 
What will you do without me 
When Winter time comes on? 
Who'll fold their arms around you, 
As I 
have often done ? 
Who'll hug you, and caress you, 
When I 
above have flown? 
You'll know where you can find me, 
But you'll miss me when I'm gone.

THAT'S WHEN YOU WILL KNOW WHO'S 
YOUR FRIEND. 
Written and sung by BEN DonoE. 
To my true friend W ILL 
H. 
MORTON. 
It's all very foolish to boast of your friends, 
And imagine them faithful and true; 
In the hour of misfortue you surely will find 
There's no one with friendship for you. 
Your child may be starviug and crying for bread. 
No one -has a 
penny to lend 
To help drive the dread wolf away from your door— 
That's when you will know who's your friend. 
Then take my advice— it is said for your good— 
Bear in mind I 
don't wish to offend; 
Being saving of cash, and keep plenty on hand, 
And you never will want for a 
friend. 
While jogging along -through the journey of life, 
You are sure to meet sorrow and care; 
But tight boldly onward, throtigh thick and through thin, 
And never give up in despair. 
Be honest and upright, whatever you do; 
Your honor at all II DIOS defend— 
All men will look up to you then with respect, 
And he ' ,rend to be known as your friend. 
Then take mv advice, dr,c.

OH, you've heard me sing of loves and fancies, 
And speak of the Belles and Beaux; 
But once I 
oft exchanged fond glances 
With a

Her face is bright as Summer, 
Her smile like the ripling stream, 
I 
tell you she's a 
stunner, 
Yes, the fairest that ever was seen.

That grows in the lielas so near; 
With love she's set me almost crazy, 
I 
tell you she's a 
dear.—Dance 
Oh, we met by chance as I 
was strolling 
Along the crowded street, 
And my eyes at once betrayed affection, 
She returned a 
smile so sweet ; 
I 
handed her a 
message. 
Which said, 
Will you love me, and be mine?" 
When she nodded luck coquettish, 
And replied, " It's for you to name the time." 
Oh, she's pretty, 
I'm feeling just as gay and happy 
As a 
prince with his mine of gold; 
I 
did meet my charmer co 
an evening, 
And a 
tale of love unfold: 
One day she asked my income, 
I 
told ner I 
was clerk in a 
store, 
When she quickly turned the corner, 
And I 
never saw her my darling more. 
Oh. She's pretty, ft.

CM! my heart is gone, and I'm forlorn, 
A 
darling face has won me, 
Such a 
lovely girl, with teeth of pearl, 
I 
met down by the brook, 
She is the prettiest, and the wittiest, 
Her smile has quite undone me, 
I'm her only beau, she told me so, 
When first my arm she took, 
She's as pretty as a

And her voice is just the cage, where the little bird's an 
singing, 
She's the sweetest, and the neatest, 
She's as pretty as a

The roses scarce could hear us, 
Then my heart in sport, ' twas cupid's oak 
Like fishes near the shore, 
When I 
loved her so, as I 
turned to go. 
She fondly lingered near me, 
And she dropped her head, and sweetly said,

Here we are, two " LI4awanna Spooners ;" 
While we're here keep your eyes upon us; 
We load coal from Harlom to Gowanus, 
We're the two selected " Spooners of the Gang." 
When we go home our family we embrace; 
We eat our meals with elegance and grace; 
For opposition shovellers we long to have a 
race; 
We're the two selected " Spooners of the Gang," 
CHORUS. 
As through the streets we walk along like soldiers, 
And baskets and shovels we have upon our shoulders; 
For to get a 
job there's none can be bolder, 
Than the two selected " Spooners of the Gang." 
(Chorus repeated.) 
On Saturday nights we stand upon the corners, 
Along with the gang that wears the Roll of Honor 
At Hibernian Hall we're going to raise a 
banner, 
To represent the " Lackawanna Gang." 
We all get shaved in the one barber shop, 
We use the same razor, lather brush, and cup, 
For Bay Rum and Tonic we long to have a 
sup, 
To stimulate the " Lackawanna Gang." 
As through, etc. 
We've accumulated wealth with hard work and endurance; 
With other scallawags we have no interference; 
We have been hard tried by work and perseverance, 
The two selected " Spooners of the Gang." 
With the " General Committee" we are two great big cards, 
Like " Muldoon, the Solid Man," we hold a 
grip in the ward, 
We could put you on the Pipes or the City Boulevard,

From the clime where I

To cheer me when in pain,

How we used to work on the grand old Mississippi. 
9h, the passengers they used to wink, 
And look at us so shy, 
Because we dance and do a 
break, 
And throw our legs so high ; 
But now we have sung our little ditty, 
We'll go back again to the grand old Mississippi. 
White folks, we can no longer'stay, 
Or the folks will think that we have run away; 
But as soon as we reach the old plantation, 
Why a 
song and dance will be our occupation. 
Oh, the Captain was as good a 
man 
As ever you did see; 
He used to feed us on hoe-cake, 
And sometimes hominy; 
But now we are through our little ditty, 
We'll go back again to the grand old

On de ole plantation year's ago, 
'Fore this cruel war begun. 
We hoed the cotton all day long, 
Each happy Black and Tan; 
An when de dinner horn did toot, 
We make de hoecake sick— 
Ole Massa laugh an Missus shout 
Ah! Dinah, Jim an Joe! 
We're happy little Flip-Flaps, Flip-Flaps, Flip-Flaps, 
Eating corn meal, Slap-Jacks, Slap-Jacks, Jacks ; 
And when we think of our old home we shed a 
silent tear 
'Till some policeman kindly says " jus walk off on your ear. 
'Twas in bright sunny Florida, 
Where sweet Persimmons grow, 
We alligators hunted, and 
First learn'd de " heel and toe !" 
Now we are free an Massa's gone, 
To de golden streets up dar, 
We nebber hear no dinner horn— 
"Twould make a 
horse fly swear. 
We're happy, Ste. 
We've heard of " Freedmen's Bureau," 
An of Freedman's Washstands" too, 
Still no one offers us poor mokes 
A 
job of work to do ; 
But de good Lord dat make black an white, 
Won't let a 
sparrow fall, 
An when he blows his dinner horn, 
You bet we'll hear de call. 
We're happy, &c. 
is sung by the " King Bees" DELZHANTY & CUMMINGS. 
On a 
little old plantation, 
Where de light I 
first did see, 
Down on de Swauee River, 
In de State of Florida; 
Old Massa he was fat and good, 
And always used me right, 
And when I'd sing or dance for him, 
He'd scream out with delight. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, my I 
I'm as Happy as a 
Clam, (Symph.) 
I'm India Rubber Gutta Percha Gum Elastic Sam. 
(Repeat Chorus.) 
When I 
left de old plantation 
This advice he gave to me: 
Don't never mix in politics, 
Or play in Policy. 
So off I 
went just like a 
gun, 
And now I 
take my chance, 
In going around de town, 
And for de white folks sing and dance. 
Oh, my! & c. 
I've danced for every nation, 
From de Dutch to de Chinese; 
I've danced up hill and down again, 
And I 
danced upon the Seas; 
But I 
know a 
little Yellow Gal, 
And her I'm going to try; 
And I'll dance for her affections, 
Or I'll dance until I 
die. 
DANCING ON THE BRAIN. 
OF all the figs you ever see for dancing or for singing, 
Such a 
nig as me you never see to set the boards a-ringing; 
I 
go to balls and parties too, in moonlight snow or rain, 
I've got so fond of dancing that I've got dancing on the brain 
CHORUS. 
You twist your heel and shake your toe, 
Now this is how you do it, (Music.) 
Everybody's getting it and none seem to complain, 
I 
reckon it's mighty pleasant to have dancing on the brain. 
There was a 
ball the other night, I 
got an invLation, 
I 
went and got my putty's on with the greatest exultation; 
I 
was not dancing long, when I 
found it mighty plain, 
That all the gals was after me for dancing on the brain. 
You twist your, & e. 
Such a 
happy nig I 
do declare was never yet created, 
To dance and sing is my delight, and yet I'm celebrated; 
And bow I 
got this (lancing fit I 
never can explain, 
;tit I'll carve my way to glory) oh, with dancing on the brain 
You twist your, dm

GOOD evening friends, Eli sing to you, 
A 
song and dance which is true. 
I 
loved a 
girl whose name was Lew, 
But now she's ran away, 
She could sing just like a 
bird. 
The sweetest voice you ever heard, 
Her lover too was so absurd, 
And you can always hear me say. 
(7110111:S. 
I 
think I 
made a 
big mistake, 
By falling in love with Louisa Flake, 
She ran away, and gave me the shati-, 
With a 
dark compleeted coon, 
Louisa's ma don't feel content, 
For marrying that coon without her consent, 
When she heard the news in a 
tit she went, 
And made a 
terrible grumble, 
I 
know I 
was left in the cold, 
And also I 
was terrible sold, 
I'm to blame myself, I 
scold. 
For causing such a 
trouble.

While the steamboat whistle blowed,

For us figs and all the crew. 
Of course we obey orders, 
And on the boat went, 
And down the Ohio river, 
What a 
lovely time we spent.

When we arrived in Tennessee, 
We thrnwed a

And when we get the freight ashore„

And when they play our favorite,

Well up I

But stony and cold has the world been of late, . r 
And poverty still seems a 
crime. 
I

Without money you soon will decay, 
And those who you thought you could count as your friends, 
When wanted were always away.

For poverty often offends ;

For money will always find friends.

In a

Their numbers I 
could count by the score. 
But now if I 
meet them and ask them for help, 
With a 
shrug of the shoulder they say : 
Excuse rue just now ; I'll see you again !" 
And nodding, they shuffle away. 
If poor, you will find, etc.

Will fade, and its place become bright; 
And fortune, though fickle, will smile once again

I'll pay baek to those with a 
frown 
Who ought to have helped a

THE sun shines bright in the old Kentucky home; 
'Tis summer, the darkies are gay, 
The corn-top's ripe and the meadows in the bloom, 
While the birds make music music all the day. 
The young folks roll on the little cabin floor, 
All merry, all happy and bright; 
By-' n-by hard times comes a-knocking at the door— 
Then my old Kentucky home, far away. 
CHORUS. 
Weep no more, my lady, 
Oh weep no more to- day; 
We will sing one song for the old Kentucky home, 
For the old Kentucky home, far away. 
They hunt no more for the possum and the coon 
On the meadow, the hill, and the shore: 
They sing no more by the glimmer of the moon, 
On the bench by the old cabin door. 
The day goes by like a 
shadow o'er the heart, 
With sorrow where all was delight, 
The time has come when the darkies have to part, 
Then my old Kentucky home. good-night. 
Weep no more, &C. 
The head must bow and the back will have to bend, 
Wherever the darkey may go; 
A 
few more clays and the trouble all will end 
In the field where the sugar canes grow; 
A 
few more days for to tote the weary load— 
No matter, ' twill never be light; 
A 
few more days till we totter on the road, 
Then my old Kentucky homer good- night I 
Weep no more, &c„

OLD MAN NEGRO CHARACTER SONG. 
Words aud Music by Roy LESLIE. 
Oh, here I 
an kind friends, 
A 
poor old colored man, 
Ileart broken by trouble and despair, 
Who no one seems to care for 
But the Heavenly Father above, 
Who I 
know still keeps a 
home for me there, 
lye wandered for years 
Ilomeluss On this earn'. 
I'm old and I 
cannot work no more, 
And it was a 
sorry day the time I 
came away 
From my.old home in Carolina for de war. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, give me back the old home of my birth, 
And I 
never will leave it any more, 
For I'll have a 
place to live, 
And they'll bury me when I'm dead, 
In my old home in Carolina ' for de war. 
Oh, well do I 
remember when I 
was a 
little child 
A 
playing around the boiler in the mill, 
A 
nil de sound of all de wheels as dey crushed de sugar 
cane, 
Are humming in my ears plainly still, 
And well do I 
remember when our day's work was done 
How we'd dance at night upon de old log cabin floor 
D(y can talk about the free man, 
But I'd rather be a 
slave, 
In my old home in Carolina ' for de war. 
And now kind friends I 
must be going, 
I 
cannot sing uo more, 
These happy recollections give me pain, 
Although I'm old and feeble I'll try to reach my home, 
For son my soul my father he will claim, 
it was a 
sad mistake, 
But now it is too late, 
Wh . n 
de North and du South were made one, 
For we den had enough to eat 
And we had a 
place to sleep, 
Many, many years ago when I 
was young.

MY POOR HEART IS SAD WITH ITS 
DREAMING. 
As sung by the 13th Ward Glee Club. 
MY poor heart is sad with its dreaming, 
It brings back the once happy day, 
When earth like a 
heaven was sectning, 
But now it has passed all away. 
They say that young loves like the flowers, 
That needs tender care in its urn, 
But mine'it was snatched from the bower, 
And I 
never gained one in return. 
CHORUS. 
My poor heart is sad with its dreaming, 
It brings back the once happy day, 
When earth like a 
heaven was seeming, 
But now it has passed all away. 
My sad heart recalls all the pleasure, 
Of thoughts that are all, all for thee, 
When dreaming of you, of its treasure, 
And you seemed to love none but me. 
Tho' we meet not as friends, yet I'll neve; 
One kind word to thee give, 
For your cherished memory ever, 
Shall be my souli oy while I 
live.

Drunkard's Lone Child. 
OUT in this gloomy night sadly I 
roam, 
I've no mother now, no friends, no home, 
Nobody cares for me, no one would cry, 
Even if poor little Bessie should die. 
Barefoot and tired I've wandered all day, 
Asking for work, but I'm too small, they say. 
On the damp ground I 
must now lay my head, 
Father's a 
drunkard and mother is dead. 
CHORUS. 
Mother, why did you love me alone, 
With no one to love me, no friends and no home. 
Dark is the night, the storm rages wild, 
God pity Bessie, the Drunkard's Lone Child. 
We were so happy till father drank rum, 
Then all our trouble and sorrow begun. 
Mother grew paler and wept every day, 
Baby and I 
were too hungry to play. 
Slowly they faded, and one summer night 
Found their sweet faces all silent and white. 
And with big tears slowly dropping I 
said, 
Father's a 
drunkard and mother is dead. 
Oh if some temp'rance man only could find 
Poor, wretched father and speak very kind, 
If they could stop him from drinking, why then 
I 
should feel very happy again. 
Is it too late? 
Men of temp'rance, please try, 
For little Bessie will soon starve and. die. 
All the day long I've been begging for bread— 
Father's a 
drunkard and mother is dead.

The Cards are arranged in

method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have

COlsrtittg, Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are \ isited by gentlemen who are either too Mi. 
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unlady-like encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many 
lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. 
This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of qeestions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties  . .

Little Book has lately appeared in print at Mr. A. J. Fuiassea, 98 Naar 
eau street called the " Little Flirt." We cannot say that we recommend 
It to our young lady and gentlemen readers, as we think it would only 
encourage the bad habit of " flirting." 
Unfortunately, there is enough 
of it done without any further necessity of explaining " how, when we'd 
her 
et to do it," and this little volume would advise and initiate the tut-
- •Orrupted in practicing what is commonly called "flirting." 
Irks N. Y. Keening Telegram writes: " We ha-
..e 
lately seen 
neat little 
book, bound in Morocco leather, costing 'dwenty-five cents, called the 
4` 
Little Flirt," published by A. J. 
FISHER, No. 98 Nassau street. 
It 
gives information of the modua operandi of flirting, and of the meaning 
of every motion of the handkerchief, fan, glove and parasol. 
As there 
is nothing at all objectionable in the volume, and its contents might af-
ford some innocent amusement to many, we do not hesitate to moms 
'mend it to our young lady and gentleman readers."
