Field Notes 
Interview with Michael Haycook, Vice President and  Branch Manager, Farm Credit East, 
Potsdam, NY 
Interviewer: Jill Breit 
Date: June 27, 2013 
The Potsdam branch of Farm Credit East is located in the commerce park outside the village of 
Potsdam.  The interview took place in Mike’s office.  He was a very good spokesperson for his 
industry.  I asked to meet with him to get a better understanding of farm financing.   His branch 
serves the St. Lawrence and Franklin County region where most of the farmers interviewed for 
TAUNY’s dairy farm research project operate. 
Mike said a few things off tape that are of interest: 
-Farm Credit East encompasses branches in NY, NJ, MA, RI, NH, CT.
-The Potsdam branch has around 800 customers.
-The loan portfolio at the Potsdam branch is $220 million.
Mike also spoke about the relationship with Cornell Cooperative Extension.  He said the 
Extension is the place for hobbyists and others without serious business intent to get advice 
and services.  While Farm Credit East works with many small operations, they “need to make a 
profit”, so are less inclined to invest energy where they did not see potential for payback.  His
perspective is that the combination of Extension services and those of Farm Credit East 
provide a full spectrum of assistance to anyone interested in agricultural enterprise.
