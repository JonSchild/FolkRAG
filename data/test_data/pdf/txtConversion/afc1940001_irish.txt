[30E - A1?] IRISH-AMERICAN RAG. This Jimmie Blyler was a piano player. He was sent out herefrom
the East to San Francisco to play in cafes and he wrote this.I suppose he just wrote this, you know
for himself.. Of course,we all picked it up. Every piano player in town tried to play it.Nobody could
play it like Jimmie Blyler, of course. Then a fewyears after that, why, it was really published. Jimmie
Blylercalled it the ENTERTAINER'S RAG [md] er [md] called it the [IRISH-AMERICAN,?]and he had, oh,
some Irish number in the middle of it. It wasquite a popular number. And then after that, why, it was
publishedand not quite the same, but almost the same. It was publishedby J. Roberts, a very fine
piano player [md] they were both finepiano players. But I don't play the whole thing; I just play apart
of it and put something else in it [md] I don't even know thename of it. So, you want to hear it?(Mrs.
Coffin plays the music of IRISH-AMERICAN RAG.)
