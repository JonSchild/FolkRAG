THE TAPE STOPPED--TECHNICAL PROBLEM 
This particular tape was a reuse of previously—recorded 
tape, and 
it 
is possible that I failed to rewind it all 
the way--
there may be "leftover" junk ahead of the eight minutes of the 
meeting on this side

SIDE ONE:

Discussion of the goals of the project led by Glassie. 
Begins with 
a long rap on "using" people; much give and take 
with Czarnecki. "Objectifying makes people objects." Then, turns 
to discussion of a general folklife project vs. a project that 
concentrates on the landscape, some discussion of this.

Description of work—to—date from Mal O'Conner 
11:55 
Discussion, some from Rubinstein, on person in time as 
well 
as place; general discussion.

Christine Cartwright introduces moral problem, fieldnotes 
may expose a person who 
is vulnerable. Reveal 
illegal activities, 
reveal their psyche. Glassie gives lecture on history of 
fieldnotes (Malinowski) and how NO ONE will ever see his except 
him. Discussion of techniques to be used on this project, the 
chances to edit what is written.
