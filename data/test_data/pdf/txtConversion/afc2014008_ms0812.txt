t
hing t
hat happened t

olkloric
 
s
alad days.
 
My husband and I
 were l
iving i
n Topanga, Cali-
f
ornia, a
t t
he t
ime, a
long with our t
hree children,
 
t
hen aged about s
even and a
 half
, s
ix, and f
ive. I
t
 
was an active bunch. We were a
lso very broke
 
and were l
iving i
n a r
idiculously small house,
 
probably originally built f
or a
 weekend g
etaway
 
cottage. My husband and I
 s
lept i
n t
he b
ig bed on
 
t
he s
ide porch; t
he t
hree children i
n bunk beds
 
i
n t
he s
ingle bedroom. There was a
 small l
iving
 
r
oom, a
 minute k
itchen, and a
 bath with only a
 
shower s
tall. The f
amily g
rouping was f
urther
 
adorned by the presence of a dog named
 
Quartsy —whom we had bargained f
or a
t a
 l
ocal
 
swapping f
air by t
rading s
everal quarts o
f my
 
homemade applesauce f
or one delightful puppy,
 
and t
hus t
he name Quartsy.
 
When I
 t
ook Quartsy t
o t
he l
ocal v
et f
or a
 checkup,
 
he l
ooked sober. We had been t
oo naïve t
o i
nsist
 
on any k
ind o
f medical r
ecord, and t
he v
et said
 
he d
idn't think our puppy had had t
he r
ight shots.
 
I
 suspect he knew a
t t
he t
ime t
hat she was c
om-
i
ng down with d
istemper, but hoped he c
ould
 
f
orestall i
t
. His p
ills and our e
arnest administra-
t
ion o
f t
hem d
idn't s
eem t
o help, and Quartsy
 just
 
got s
icker and s
icker. And t
hen my husband got
 
a
 week-long
 j
ob out o
f
 s
tate and had t
o l
eave home
 
f
or s
everal days. We needed t
he work and t
he
 
money, and he had t
o go.
 
Well. Early one e
vening, t
hen, I
 f
ound myself
 with
 
a
 dying dog, t
hree young and passionately i
nter-
e
sted children, and no backup. Quartsy began t
o
 
have c
onvulsions, and I
 f
inally l
ocked her i
n t
he
 
bathroom, a
fraid t
hat i
n her spasms she might
 
b
ite s
omeone. F
inally, she quieted down. I
 l
ooked
 
t
imorously a
t her —she was obviously dead —and
 
went i
nto t
he bedroom and t
old t
he children t
hat
 
Quartsy had d
ied, and now i
t
 was t
ime f
or a
ll o
f
 
us t
o go t
o bed. Which i
t was —and l
ate, t
oo. I
 
kept t
hinking I
 had t
o keep l
i
fe moving a
long i
n
 
as o
rdinary a
 r
outine as possible.
 
The children were a
ll o
f t
hem cheerful and v
ery
 
excited. They carefully i
nspected what t
hey c
ould
 
s
ee o
f Quartsy —she was l
ying c
overed by a
 t
owel
 
on t
he bathroom f
loor —then brushed t
heir t
eeth,
 
Page 2 -

put on t
heir pajamas and went t
o bed. I
 r
ead a
 
s
tory and sang each one a
 s
ong. There was only
 
one variation i
n t
he usual r
outine. The middle
 
child —the s
ix-year-old g
irl —bounced i
nto bed,
 
pulled up t
he c
overs, and said t
hat she wanted
 
e
verybody's animals t
o s
leep with. I
 said i
ncredu-
l
ously, "What?" She r
epeated her announce-
ment—it wasn't a
 r
equest —and t
hen I
 saw t
hat
 
t
he o
ther two (
the o
lder and t
he younger) were
 
p
icking up t
heir own e
very-night-clutched-to-the
 
bosom s
tuffed animals, f
our o
r f
ive apiece, and
 
t
aking t
hem over t
o t
heir s
ister without any s
igns
 
o
f r
eluctance, as t
hough i
t
 were a
 s
tandard part
 
o
f t
he n
ightly r
outine. She went t
o s
leep t
hat n
ight
 
under a
 small mountain o
f s
tuffed t
oys. Nobody
 
e
lse had any a
t a
ll. Nobody s
eemed t
o mind.
 
During t
he n
ight I
 was waked up by my o
lder
 
daughter, who said t
hat she had been having bad
 
d
reams about how I
 had d
ied. My husband was
 
away and I
 d
idn't f
eel a
ll t
hat good myself
, s
o I
 
t
ook her i
n t
he b
ig bed and we s
lept t
ogether
 
s
oundly t
he r
est o
f t
he n
ight t
hrough. There was
 
no word a
t a
ll f
rom t
he youngest child.
 
Next day was a
 s
chool day. I
 spent a
 good deal o
f
 
t
ime wondering what should I
 do now—get s
ome-
body t
o c
ome and d
isappear t
he dog while t
he
 
children were away, wait t
i
ll t
hey got home t
o do
 
i
t
, o
r what. F
inally, I
 decided t
hat f
ate had brought
 
i
t
 about t
hat t
his was t
he t
ime f
or us as a
 f
amily
 
t
o l
earn about death —in i
ts proper c
ontext, when
 
i
t
 a
ctually had happened. So when t
he children
 
came home af
ter s
chool, I
 announced t
hat we
 
would be having a
 f
uneral. We were going t
o bury
 
Quartsy up t
he h
ill behind our house, where I
 
had a
lready dug a
 shallow g
rave i
n a
 p
lace where
 
we c
ould go and v
isit her, and we should p
ick
 
s
ome f
lowers and t
hink o
f n
ice t
hings t
o say t
o
 
each o
ther about what a
 f
ine dog she was.
 
The c
eremony went of
f
 without a
 h
itch. We made
 
a s
traggly procession up t
he h
ill, me carrying
 
Quartsy who kept t
he bathroom t
owel a
s a
 shroud.
 
We each t
hrew a
 handful o
f d
irt on her as she l
ay
 
i
n t
he hole, and a
fter I
 had f
i
lled i
n w
ith t
he shovel,
 
we patted i
t
 a
ll down and sprinkled t
he f
lowers
 
over her. The children were t
hrilled and happily
 
proposed t
hat we go down and make a
 p
icnic f
or
 
supper and c
ome back and eat i
t
 a
t t
he g
raveside.
 
But by t
his t
ime I
 had about had i
t
. I
 was myself
 
g
rieved over t
he dog, and f
rankly I
 was beginning
 
t
o wonder i
f
 a
ll our t
hree charming children were
 
s
ome k
ind o
f
 undiscovered monsters. Nobody had

s
omewhat overstimulated. And t
he i
dea o
f
 a
 merry
 
p
icnic a
t t
he g
rave s
imply r
evolted me. I
 said ab-
s
olutely not, and we a
ll t
railed back down t
he h
ill.
 
I
 can't r
emember any more i
f
 t
he f
ormer n
ight's

epeated. I
 r
ather
 
t
hink t
hey were l
ef
t i

i

isome d
reams about my survival, and again we
 
s
lept t
ogether except I
 d
idn't s
leep v
ery well t
his
 
t
ime.
 
The next morning, a
 Saturday, my-f
ive-year-old
 
s
on appeared —all dressed, shiny, and cheerful —
 
a
te a
 hearty breakfast, and t
hen said, "Hey Ma,
 
s
ing me a
 dead s
ong." Previously he had made no
 
c
omment whatever about t
he dog o
r t
he f
uneral
 
o
r any o
f t
he adventures we had been having: he
 
had just c
ome a
long s
erenely f
or t
he r
ide, s
o t
o
 
say, watching what was going on.
 
I
 said, "
I
 don't want t
o s
ing a
 dead s
ong." I
 hadn't
 
e
ven had my c
offee yet. But my s
on, was —and

o
r 20 more r
equests o
f "C'mon Ma, s
ing me a

rritation boiled over. I
 said, "

I
 don't want t

f

."
 
He f
inally wandered outside. I
 drank my coffee
 
and f
e
lt abused and neglected. After awhile I
 heard
 
a
 young voice s
inging abstractedly out on t
he back
 
patio, a
ccompanied only by t
he r
olling wheels o
f
 
a
 t
ruck he was pushing:

I
 have t

hat my r
eaction was, Well, t

g
oodness he's t
hought one up. As t
he day went
 
on, s
o d
id our usual l
i
fe. We went on our weekly
 
Saturday expedition t
o t
he market and t
he pub-
l
i
c l
ibrary. None o
f t
he children brought up t
he
 
subject o
f t
he dog o
r t
he f
uneral o
r anything a
t
 
t
hat t
ime —they d
id i
n a
 f
ew days —but basically
 
l
i
fe r
esumed i
ts o
ld pace and pattern, except t
hat
 
i
n t
he f
ollowing weeks I
 began t
o notice my s
on
 
was s
inging quite a
 l
arge number o
f dead s
ongs.
 
I
t
 got k
ind o
f overwhelming.
 
He s
ang,
 
Hush, l
i
ttle baby, don't you c
ry,
 
You know o
ld Quartsy's bound t
o d
ie.
 
A
ll my t
r
ials, Lord, s

J

iver i
s chilly and c
old
 
l
ie s
ang,
 
Who k
illed o

illed o

Quartsy?
 
I
 s
aid t
he sparrow with my l
i
ttle bow and
 
a
rrow,
 
I
t
 was I
,
 oh, i
t
 was I
.
 
Who dug h

I
 said t
he snake, with my l
i
ttle spade and
 
r
ake,
 
I
t
 was I
,
 oh i
t
 was I
.
 
And he sang,
 
Old Quartsy i
s dead and l
aid i
n t
he g
round,
 
Laid i
n t
he g
round, l
aid i
n t
he g

Old Quartsy i

aid i
n t

round,
 
Way h
igh up.
 
There g
rew up an apple t
ree over h

And he sang,
 
Quartsy d
ied on Sunday, on Sunday, on
 
Sunday,
 
Quartsy d
ied on Sunday when t
he weather
 
was good.
 
We buried her on Sunday, on Sunday, on
 
Sunday,
 
We buried her on Sunday when t
he weather

And he sang,
 
Soon one morning death came a
-creeping i
n
 
t
he r
oom. (
3X)
 
Oh my Lord, oh my Lord, what shall I
 do t
o
 
be saved?
 
Well, death done been here, t
ook my Quartsy
 
and gone. (
3)Q
 
Oh my Lord, oh my Lord, what shall I
 do t
o
 
be saved?
 
And he sang,
 
I
 had an o
ld dog and h
is name was Quartsy,
 
And I
 bet you f
ive dollars he's a
 good dog t
oo.
 
Come on Quartsy, you good dog you. (
2X)
 
When Quartsy d
ied, he d
ied s
o hard
 
That he shook t
he g
round i
n my backyard....
 
I
t s
eemed t
o be endless. I
 began t
o worry af
ter
 
awhile. For heaven's sake, how many dead s
ongs
 
was he going t
o come up with? Admittedly h
is
 
poetic s
tandards were not t
erribly r
ef
ined. He just
 
substituted t
he dog's name f
or any deceased per-
f
'aqe 4—
 
s
on o
r t
hing mentioned i
n a
 s
ong, r
egardless o
f
 
rhyme o
r meter o
r e
ven s
ense, and sang on away.
 
And how many s
ongs about death d
id he know,
 
anyway? I
 had had absolutely no i
dea t
he extent
 
o
f h
is r
epertory o
f s
ongs about morbidity. I
 got
 
k
ind o
f embarrassed; admittedly I
 had sung a
ll
 
t
hose s
ongs a
round t
he p
lace, but I
 wasn't t
each-
i
ng t
hem t
o t
he children, I
 was just s
inging what
 
came i
nto my head, and t
here a
re l
ots o
f t
radi-
t
ional and nontraditional s
ongs about death, i
f
 
you s
top and t
hink about i
t
.
 
I
 t
hought a
 l
ot about t
he whole episode. For one
 
t
hing, t
he way t
hat t
he t
hree d
ifferent children
 
(
of t
hree d
ifferent ages, r
emember) had chosen t
o
 
deal with t
he dog's passing s
truck me particu-
l
arly. The o
lder child had t
aken t
he possibility o
f
 
death and l
aid i
t
 on me (
I
 suspect t
o shield her-
s
elf f
rom t
he e
ven more t
errifying notion t
hat she
 
herself c
ould d
ie). The s
ix year o
ld had f
ound a
 
d
ifferent s
olution, by calling on a
ll t
he available
 
animals t
o protect her, i
n r
eturn I
 suppose f
or
 
g
iving t
hem a
 s
ociable and c
omfortable warm bed
 
t
o s
leep i
n —a v
ery f
air arrangement, I
 t
hought.
 
I
n another way o
f putting i
t
, t
he o
lder child had
 
expressed her f
ears t
hrough another person, t
he
 
s
econd t
hrough t
hings t
hat she c
ould handle and
 
manipulate, while t
he t
hird had t
ried t
o deal w
ith
 
t
he desperately un-understandable e
vent s
ymboli-
cally, t
hrough l
anguage. I
 began t
o r
ealize t
hat,
 
o
f
 t
he t
hree, my young s
on had had t
he l
east p
rac-
t
ice i
n t
alking about so mething so t
otally
 
unfamiliar and b
izarre as death, and t
hat's p
rob-
ably why he d
idn't e
ver say anything much. The
 
g
irls had chattered on a
 good b
it, but t
hey were
 
o
lder and could r
ead, and he d
idn't know t
he
 
p
roper t
echnical t
erms. The s
ongs a
llowed h
im t
o
 
t
alk about dying and death and f
unerals i
n an
 
appropriate and d
ignif
ied way.
 
And as he sang on and on and on (
quite cheer-
f
ully, by way; t
here was no t
ragic note i
n h
is dead
 
s
ongs a
s f
ar a

 wondered i
f
 he wasn't
 
a

ort o
f
, absorbing t

My husband's s

ong s
ince gone, had a
 
c
lassic New England s
tyle o
f
 humor and d
iscourse,
 
and one o
f h
is f
avorite p

o i
nsist t
hat
 
a
fter a
 b
ig f
amily d
inner, e
veryone must go out
 
f
or a
 walk t
ogether. "We need t
o s
timulate t
he
 
phagocytes," he would say, beaming and rubbii
 
h
is hands t
ogether and swinging t
he l
i
ttlest chi
 
up t
o h
i  shoulder. And i
t
 was such a
 spiendi
 
i
n t
he f
amily has e
choed h
im e
ver s
ince. I
t
's j
ust
 
t
hat dumb t
hing you say when you go out f
or a
 
walk—you're going t
o go s
timulate t
he o
ld phago-
cytes. Frankly, i
t
 was only while I
 was writing out
 
t
his t
alk t
hat i
t suddenly o
ccurred t
o me t
hat I
 
r
eally ought t
o g
et t
he d
ictionary and s
ee i
f
 t
here
 
was any such t
hing as a phagocyte anyway. I
t
 
had a
lways had a s
ort o
f Lewis Carroll "
slithy
 
t

eeling t
o me. But by gum, t
here i
t
 was i
n
 
t
he o
ld Webster's —"a phagocyte: any l
eukocyte
 
a
ctive i
n i
ngesting and destroying waste and
 
harmful material, bacteria, e
tc. i
n t
he b
lood o
r
 
t

re
 
worthy i
tems t
o be s
timulated, and I
'm g
lad t
o
 
know t
hat, a
lter a
ll t
hese years.
 
But i

ense i
t
 d
idn't r

He d

You know, i

's only r
elatively r
ecently anyway t
hat
 
adults began t
o write special children's l
i

s

orth. I

 was surprised
 
t

c
ontemporaries, t
hey were r
egarded as r

p
ioneers i

Grimm s

riginally known as "
house-
hold t
ales," not f
airytales, and t
hey were t
old not
 
j
ust t
o children but t
o whoever happened t
o be
 
a

idn't have a

 I

ber i
t
: I
 haven't checked i

I
 had a

Oh doggy Do-lally, s

He l
ived upon c

and s
oda poppers,
 
And t

Oh f

She l

Well, I
 heard Pete Seeger s

 moved a

et
 
t

i
t was new a

 t
aught i
t
 
t
o a c
lass o

 had i

n t
he San Fernando Valley.
 
I
t
 was spring, and we were meeting a
t one o

women's houses, and t

t
heir mothers were p
laying a
round on t

and s
l
ides i

hey never d
id. Actually, t
hey paid
 
no a
ttention t
o us whatever, t
hey
 just swung and
 
s
l

I
n t

t

 was going t

 d

be a s

would a

I
'

what i

t said t
hat her s

i

s

f t

t a

t
hrough a

t made her f
eel t
erribly

He was r
ight r
eady t
o
 
l

, you s
ee, and —clomp! —he got i
t
 a
ll a

Furthermore, she said, i
n t
he next s
everal weeks
 
he had c
ome up with two s
tanzas o
f h
is own. One
 
went l
ike t
his:
 
I
 have a
 squirrel, her name i
t
 i
s Pearl,
 
Oh squirly, oh whiny with a
 l
ong bushy t
ail.
 
She l
ives upon walnuts and f
at nuts and t
all
 
nuts,
 
And i
n summertime, she dances i
n t
he t
rees.
 
I
 wish I
 c
ould have shown t
his t
o Malvina. I
t
 s
eems
 
t
o me t
hose f
our l
ines would have assured her
 
t
hat she had t
ruly h
it a
 home run t
o t

she was s

his young man
 
showed h
is r

trong poetic s
trut
 
t
ure; o
f
 i
nternal and external rhyme s
chemes; a
i
 
o
f t
houghtful, colorful l
anguage; and f
inally I
i
 
demonstrated h
is own i
ndependent authority t
 u
 
abandon a
ll t
he rules when c
ritical aesthetic i
 
sues a

f he wanted t

His s
econd production was:
 
I

Oh, s

 can't say a

She g
ets i

t

She i
s a
 b

 now c
lose my door.
 
Here we f
ind our poet utilizing t
he artistic s
truc-
t
ures available t
o h
im f
or purposes o
f
 protest. Very
 
f
ew experienced s
ongwriters have not done t

hing. A
lmost a
ll t
he f
amous protest s
ongs
 
a
re based on o
ther widely known t
unes and/or
 
v
erses, and t
hus t
hey carry with t
hem a
 double
 
o
r t
r
iple emotional weight. A s
ong t
hat I
've of
ten
 
sung, "Charlie and t
he MTA," was preceded by
 
"
The New York Subway That Never Returned,"
 
"
The [
Railroad] Train That Never Returned," and
 
"
The Ship That Had Never Returned" —all we ll
-
known and d
ifferent songs, a
ll widely sung. Each
 
t
ragedy, t
hen, ea r
ned extra power s
temming f
rom
 
t
he previous versions.
 
What I
'm saying here i
s that i
t
 i
s t
he contents o
f
 
one's head that produce poetry, s
ympathy, a
ffec-
t
ion, understanding, co mprehension, c
reativity.
 
As parents and as t
eachers and as people who
 
s
imply exist a
long with our young on t
he same
 
p
lanet, i
t i
s c
rucial f
or us t
o s
ee t
o i
t that our
 
children's heads have available t
o t
hem the best
 
we have ourselves l
earned —structurally, poeti-
cally, e
thically, i
n a
ll k
inds o
f
 ways. As I
'
ve a
lready
 
pointed out, t
hese patterns and i
deas a
re o
f-
t
en absorbed before t
hey are ever obviously
 
needed o
r ever obviously t
aught o
r even
 
understood. I
t
 i
s a
ll t
he more c
ritical, t
hen,
 
t
hat t
hey be patterns and i
deas t
hat a
re
 
suf
f
iciently f
lexible and s
trong t
hat our
 
children can g
row within t
hem.
 
As I
 said t
o begin with, I
 am not raising
 
children t
oday, and the outlook i
s aw-
f
ully d
ifferent f
ro m t
he t
ime when I
 was.
 
I
t
 i
s desperately t
ragic t
hat our children's
 
heads a
re being s
tuffed with v
iolence,
 
s
exism, r
acism, and o
ther abo minations
 
by t
he g
eneral surrounding culture. So I
 
want you t
o be confident t
hat, t
hough t
here i
sn't
 
any magical r
epertoire that will c
ombat t
his, t
he
 
t
ruly wonderful t

s t
hat every child will e
ven-
t
ually choose what he o
r she r
emembers according
 
t
o personal preferences, need, t

tural r
epertoire. Here i
s where g

appear on the f
ront l
ine, brave and devoted
 
enough t
o t
ake on the r
esponsibility o
f providing
 
new, i
ntriguing, and previously unexplored
 
nourishment f
or our children.
 
They deserve the best, and a
fter we've done
 
a

But I
 must c

 quite d

rom c

. P

bhorred i

 r
ight (
l
ef

e t
hought t

r
 
e
conomic c
lasses were a
bominable. He was a
 u
nion man, a
nd, l
ike my f
ather, h
e was a

f h

Now Woody h

There i
