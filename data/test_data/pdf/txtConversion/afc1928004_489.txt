SAM B. 
VILLA'S LIFE. 
EVERY artist, however humble or great, has a 
past, that, 
if truthfully told, is interesting to tile general public. 
Tile subject of OUr sketch was born in the classic precincts 
of 13Jston, and at the age of tour years showed musical 
ability of no CO 111111011 order. 
So great was his love tor 
music, that at the tere of seven years, without any tuition 
he played the popidar music of the day by ear. At the age 
of t,
,velye, he was considered one ot the best educated 
pianists in B.)ston, ansl his parents determined 10 educate 
him in all the branches of music, 
lie was considered by 
musical critics to be the best accompanist then known, 
and was eagerly sought after by the leading singers of 
Boston. 
Young Villa all this time was secretly hiding 
his love and intensity for the Dramatic Profession, and if 
a 
mistake was made in his -
playing, his excuse would be, 
"Plague take the stage." 
Oneo Ins mother overheard the 
remark, and being a 
stern opponent of the stage, was hor-
rified. 
Then it all came out, that under an assumed 
name Villa had for three weeks been a member of the 
Boston Atheneum Goan) Lay, and the only way to get to 
Boston in those day's ( his home was three miles from the 
heart of the city) was by skating over the back bay (now 
filled in), and after the plrforii tie s 
skate home again, 
and practising an unavoidable doe it on ins parents, who 
supposed that he was prasticing for concerts in the city. 
The " murder was out," and although denied the home 
that nurtured him, Villa persevered and showed remark-
able talent for the stage ; and after his mother, " who 
now rests in peace," found that argument was useless, and 
that " heT boy"' was not ruined, as people thought he 
would surely be, she opened her arms and bade him enter 
the profession he had chosen, and she would not forsake 
him. 
For years he studied hard, and success crowned 
his ell rts. 
He app..ared successfully at twiny of the 
princip ti theatres of the country, and eleven years ago-
15—he organized the 
present Agnes Wallace•Yilla 
Conabination—one of the best established and most sacs 
cessful conipiiiis in the country. 
His motto always has 
been to promise no Ui no that he feels he can do. ,
fristice 
to fellow actors, and a 
fair return to his audiences. 
This 
is his twelfth annual tour, and has begun most auspi-
ciously.

QUEEN OF THE NIGHT. 
M EDLEY No. 3. 
tiug with great success by SAM VILLA. 
QUEEN of the night, rise, rise, 
use in thy beauty. Queen of the night ; 
Queen of the night, rise, rise, 
Rise in thy beauty, Queen of the night, 
And meet me in the park next _Monday. 
0, don't forget, my pretty little pet, 
0, meet me in the park next Monday, 
And we'll wander all around, 
And we'll meet there by the river, 
\\ here the water lilies grow. 
Yes, we'll meet there by the river, 
Where the charming little water lilies, 
Dancing in the dreamy waltz, 
Beautiful sweet, and dreamy waltz, 
As round and round 
Through each magic strain we whirl. 
Dancing in the dreamy waltz 
Is perfection, perfection ; 
0, yes it is perfection. 
And if you notice my graceful style, 
You'll tind I 
am— 
Just about as jolly as they make them, 
Always laughing-, and I 
never frown ; 
So if you ever -wish to find me, 
Just inquire for the prettiest girl in town, 
For I'm just about as jolly as they make them, 
Always laughing, and I 
never frown ; 
So if you ever wish to find me, 
Call me sweet and tender names, 
And gently smooth my tresses, 
And all the while my happy icart 
Beat time to your caresses. 
SPOKEN. — Who does all this ? 
His name is Hildebrand Montrose, 
He meets me in the park, and pulls me by the nose, 
He calls me lump o' sugar, 
This very best of beaux, 
And says that he will marry me, 
His violet, his rose, 
RiToit, 
His name is, - etc. 
LOVE IN THE LANE. 
The music of this song is published by E. H. IllnpixG, 2.
29 Bowery, New 
York. 
W HILE lilacs bloom in yonder lane, 
Sweet resort of bird and bee, 
Ere the sun forsakes the plain, 
One I 
love will watch for me. 
Where the linnet fluttere.th low, 
Where the gate swings to and fro, 
Where the wild white roses grow, 
Agnes will be waiting me. 
CHORUS. 
My bonny Agnes will be waiting, 
Waiting at the gate for me. 
My bonny Agnes will be waiting, waiting, 
Waiting at the gate for me. 
To paint her beauty, words would fail 
Nature's own sweet child she seems, 
Leaning o'er yon time-worn rail, 
Lost in Love's delicious dreams. 
When to her this ring I 
show, 
Fast the crimson tide will flow, 
O'er her face and breast of snow. 
Stay, fair sun thy parting beams. 
My bonny Agnes, etc. 
She heard my step, one joyful start, 
One low cry of ecstasy, 
As I 
pressed her to my heart, 
'Neath the bright plumed lilac tree; 
Then we wandered side by side, 
As the purple twilight died ; 
And I 
whispered to my bride, 
0 how blest our home will be. 
My bonny Agnes, etc. 
PRETTY POLLYWOG. 
Sung by LUCIE VILLA. 
A. TREE-TOAD, 
dressed in apple-green, 
Sat on a 
mossy log, 
Beside a 
pond, and shrilly sang, 
Come forth, my Pollywog, 
My Pol—my ly 
my wog, 
My pretty Pollywog, 
I've something very sweet to say. 
My slender Pollywog. 
The air is moist, the moon is hid 
Behind a 
heavy fog; 
No stars are out to blink and wink 
At you, my Pollywog. 
My Pol—my ly—my wog, 
My graceful Pollywog. 
0, tarry not, beloved one, 
My precious Pollywog. 
Just then away went clouds, and there 
A 
sitting on the log— 
The other end I 
mean— 
Showed angry Pollywog ; 
Her small eyes flashed, she swelled until 
She looked almost a 
frog. 
" 
HoW dare you call me, sir," she said, 
" 
Your precious Pollywog. 
" 
Why, one would think you're life was spent 
In some low muddy bog ; 
I'd have you know to strange young toads, 
My name's Miss Mary Wog." 
ry-0 Wog, 
0, proud Miss Mary Wog, 
0, goodness gracious, what a 
joke. 
Hurrah for Mary Wog.

They tell me I 
am too bashful by far, 
And sometimes I 
think they are right, 
But so awfully naughty the masculines are, 
No wonder one feels in a 
fright. 
I've been led to believe men were born to deceive, 
So when they their compliments pay, 
In language absurd, I 
don't hear a 
word, 
But first as a 
caution I 
say: 
Cnonus. 
Go away, get along, go along, get away, 
You don't say what you mean, or mean what you say; 
'Go away, naughty boy, go ever so far, 
You are so awfully awful, you are. 
Go away, get along, go along, get away, 
You don't say what you mean, or mean what you say; 
Go away, naughty boy, go ever so far, 
You are so awfully awful, you are. 
When I 
go to a 
ball, and one asks me to dance, 
At the finish I 
soon slip away, 
For I 
know Mr. Noodle, if he has the chance, 
Is sure to have something to say; 
So I 
stop the sad man as soon as I 
can, 
In case he'd be going too far, 
Perhaps what he'd tell me he has told two or three, 
For such sad Don Giovanis they are. 
Go away, etc. 
I 
dread Christmas time whene'er it comes ' round, 
'Cho' it's awfully jolly, I 
know, 
But so many young men, again and again, 
Lead me under the mistletoe; 
Oh would you believe, on last Christmas eve, 
I 
found a 
young man at my feet, 
With an offer of marriage, a 
mansion and carriage, 
Of course I 
soon beat a 
retreat. 
Go away, eft, 
THE SHAMROCK. 
Recitation by MISS LI:CIE VILLA. 
Mr boy left me just twelve years ago; . 
'Twas the black year of famine, of sickness and woe, 
When the crops died out, and the people died too, 
And the whole land into one great graveyard grew, 
And our neighbors' faces were as white and as thin 
As the face of the moon when she first comes in ; 
And honest men's hearts were rotten with blight, 
And they thieved and they prowled like the wolves at 
night; 
When the whole land was dark as dark could be, 
'Twas then that Donald my boy left me. 
We were turned from our farm where we'd lived so long, 
For we couldn't pay the rent, and the law was strong ; 
From our low meadow lands and flax fields. blue, 
And the handsome green hills where the yellow furze grew, 
And the honest old cow, that each evening would stand 
At the little gate lowing to be milked by my hand ; 
And the small patch of garden at the end of the lawn, 
Where Donald grew sweet flowers for his Colleen Bawn. 
But Donald and I 
had to leave all these, 
I 
to live with father and he to cross the seas. 
For Donald was as proud as any king's son, 
And swore he'd not stand by and see such wrong done, 
But would seek a 
fortune in the wide, wide west, 
Where the honest can find labor and the weary rest ; 
And as soon as he was able, why, then he'd send for me, 
To rest my poor old head in his home across the sea. 
THE SHAMROCK.=Coutinued: 
And his young face flushed like a 
June sky at dawn, 
As he said that he was thinking how his Colleen Dawn 
Could come along to help me keep the house straight, 
For lie knew how much she loved him, and she'd prom-
ised to wait. 
I 
think I 
see him now, as he stood that blessed day, 
With his pale smiling face on the broad Limerick quay, 
And I 
leaning on his breast, with his long curly hair 
Blowing all about my shoulders as if to keep me there, 
And the quivering of his lip, that he tried to keep so proud, 
Not because of his old mother, but the idle curious crowd. 
Then the hoisting of the anchor, and the flapping of the 
sails, 
And the stopping of my heart when the wild Irish wails 
From the mothers and the children and the kinsfolk on 
the quay, 
Told me plainer than words, that my darling was away. 
Ten years went dragging by, and I 
heard but now and 
then, 
For my Donald, though a 
brave boy, was no scholar with 
his pen ; 
But he sent me kind words, and bade me not despair, 
And sometimes sent me 11101ley, perhaps more than he 
could spare. 
So I 
waited, and I 
prayed, until it came to pass, 
That Father Pat he sent for me one Sunday after mars ; 
And I 
went a 
little fearsome to the back vcstry room, 
Where his reverance sat a- smiling like a 
sunflower in the 
gloom, 
And he up and told me, God bless him, that my boy 
Had sent to bring me over, and T 
nearly died for joy.

' 
THE SHAMROCK.— Continued. 
All day I 
was half crazed as I 
wandered through the 
house ; 
The dropping of the sycamore seed, or the scrambling of 
a 
mouse, 
Thrilled through me like a 
gunshot. I 
durs't not look 
behind, 
For the pale face of my darling was always in my mind ; 
The dark face so mournful, the eyes so large and black, 
And soft shining as the deer's are in young Lord Mayor's 
park ; 
And the long chestnut hair, blown loosely by the wind, 
All this seemed at my shoulder, and I dare not look 
behind ; 
But I 
said in my own heart, it is the second sight 
Of the day when I 
shall kiss him, all beautiful and bright. 
Then I 
minute my box ready, to go across the sea ; 
My boy had sent a 
ticket, so my passage it was free ; 
Bat all the time I 
longed that some little gift I 
had, 
To take across the ocean to my own bonnie lad, 
A 
pin, or a 
chain, or something of the kind, 
.Tust to mind the poor boy of the land he'd left behind. 
But I 
was too poor to buy them, so I'd nothing left to do 
But to go to the old farm, the homestead that he knew. 
To the handsome green hill, where my Donald used to 
play, 
And cut a 
sod of Shamrock for the exile far away. 
All through the voyage I 
nursed it and watered it each 
day, 
And kept its green leaves sheltered from the salt sea spray, 
And I'd bring it up on deck when the sun was shining 
fair, 
To watch the triple leaflets opening slowly to the air.

THE SHAMROCK.—Coneluded. 
At first the sailors laughed at my little sod of grass, 
But when they knew my object they gently let me pass ; 
And the ladies in the cabin were very kind to me, 
And made me tell the story of my boy across the sea. 
So I 
told them of my Donald and his fair manly face, 
Till bare speaking of my darling made a 
sunshine in the 
place. 
We landed at the Battery in New York's big bay, 
The sun was shining brightly, and the wharves looked 
0-ay, 
But I 
could see no sunshine nor beauty in the place, 
What I 
only cared to look on was Donald's sweet face ; 
But in all the great crowd, and I 
turned everywhere, 
I 
couldn't see a 
sign of him—my darling wasn't there. 
I 
asked the men around to go and find my son, 
But they only stared and laughed, and left me one by 
one, 
Till at last an old countryman came up to me and said— 
How could I 
live to hear it—that Donald he was dead. 
The Shamrock sod is growing on Greenwood's hillside, 
It grows above the head of my darling and my pride, 
And in pleasant weather I 
sit by the headstone all day, 
With my heart growing old and my head growing gray, 
And I 
watch the dead leaves whirl from the sycamore 
trees, 
And wonder why it is that I 
can't die like these ; 
But I 
think that this same winter, and from my heart I 
hope, 
I'll be lying nice and quiet upon Greenwood's hilly slope, 
With my darling close beside me underneath the trickling 
dew, 
And the Shamrock creeping pleasantly above us two.

WHOA, 
EDITIA. 
SOME folks call me a 
laundress, 
Soapsuds, old starch, and blue, 
Because I'm a good Templar, 
And take in washing too ; 
But what care I 
for rude remarks, 
-Whatever I 
may hear, 
If I 
can only stop my wife 
Front drinking lager beer. 
CHORES. 
0, Emma ! Whoa, Emma ! 
Emma, this will never do. 
Whoa, Emma ! 
0, Emma ! 
Emma, I'm ashamed of you. 
(Repeat Chorus.) 
One time she was quite temperate, 
Just sip'd some currant wine 
'Whenever we had friends around 
At good old Christmas time ; 
But now she drinks just like a 
fish, 
In fact more like a 
whale ; 
If you should ask her what she'll take, 
SPOKEN. — She'll reply, " I 
don't mind—anything will 
do,—just— 
A 
small drop in a 
pail." 
0, Emma, etc. 
Each morning she is up by six, 
And flies away from home, 
Before she does a 
stroke of work, 
Or gives her locks a 
comb. 
When she returns of course I'm up, 
And all our children straight ; 
But she is always out again 
Before the clock strikes eight. 
SPOKEN. — Just for a 
thimble full, and when she returns, 
I, like a 
fond and affectionate husband, say-
0, Emma, etc. 
TAKE IT BOB." 
Written and Composed by A RTHUR LLOYD. 
I'M a 
jolly old in her, Bob B II is my name, 
And in my own village I'm well known to fame, 
I've a 
wife and a 
daughter, a 
dear little las«. 
I'm fond of them both, and I'm fond of a 
glass. 
Some say. I'm to 
fond, well, perhaps that may be, 
I 
try to be steady, and aan, s 
you see, 
But if I 
attempt to refuse al ink a-day, 
I 
fancy the wheel of the mill seems to say— 
Ca 0 
lain-3. 
Take it Bob, take it Bob. take it Bob, take it Bob, 
That's what I 
fancy the mill smys te inc; 
Take it Bob, take it Bob, take it Bob, taLe it Bob, 
Take it Bob, take it Bob, it's better than tea. 
I've tried very oft a 
tee-totlet to be, 
But my mill is quite right, nrandy's better than tea, 
And altho' what I 
say, you may all think absurd, 
I 
believe what the mill says is right, 'pen my we:rd. 
called on old Jones 'bout some business, you know, 
Ad 
be said, Bob, a 
pipe and a 
glass, ' fore ye go, 
Now I 
didn't require it. believe what I 
say, 
But altho' a 
mile off, I 
could hear the mill say— 
Take it Bob, Sce, 
Now I 
dreamt Vother night that Bob Bell was no more, 
That he'd died at the age of p'rhaps forty or more, 
Awl I 
beard people round me say, drink's done its worst, 
But altho' I 
was dote], I 
was dying with thirst. 
A bottle of brandy close by I 
could see, 
It was meant for the mourners, it wasn't for me, 
But as on my bed, still and silent I 
lay, 
In the distance distinctly I 
beard the mill may— 
Take it Bob, &i.e. 
I'm only up here for a 
bit of a 
spree, 
My wife thinks it's business between yon and mo, 
And you know the old saying, that never deceives, 
What time heart doesn't see why the eve doesn't grieve, 
I 
must todd.c at once. «o 
good bye to ye all, 
Next sea- on I 
hope I 
shall give ye a 
call, 
Don't ask moo to drink when I'm going away, 
'Jr I'm certain to fancy I 
hear hear the mill say— 
Take it Bob.

I'VE a

Baby mine, baby mine ; 
He can wrestle with a

Baby mine, baby mine ; 
Puts molasses in his hair, 
Knocks his head against the chair, 
Thank goodness there's not a

All his clothes he loves to tear. 
Baby mine. 
He's as gentle as a

Baby mine, baby mine ;

Baby mine, baby mine : 
When his face is like ft beet, 
And his fist he tries to eat, 
Mixes sugar with his meat, 
Baby mine, baby mine ; 
On the table goes his feet, 
Baby mine. 
Takes the kitten by the tail, 
Baby mine, baby mine ; 
Pnts ller in the water pail. 
Baby mine, baby mine ; 
Puts plum pudding on her toes, 
Sticks a

He's as sweet as any rose, 
Baby mine. baby mine ; 
Cares for neither friends or foes,

I LOVE but thee ; thee, only thee; 
My heart is truly thine ;

You're the dearest, the fairest on all the earth, 
And the only one I

And my heart to you is very very true. 
You're the fairest in all the creation,

You're the prettiest, and the wittiest. 
You're smile has quite undone me. 
You're my only beau, for you told me so, 
When first we met by chance ; 
You're the prettiest, and the wittiest, 
You're a

And the boys all shout, when we start out, 
Are you there, Moriarity ? 
You're a

And the boys all shout, when we start out— 
I've got a

Its just like a 
monkey or any flunkey. 
If you had that donkey, wouldn't it be hunkey ? 
Then you could,— 
Kiss me and caress me, and I 
wouldn't say no ; 
I 
couldn't say no, I 
wouldn't say no.

But if mamma knew it, what would she say ?

A 
GALLANT corps in Baxter street 
Have organized of late,

The pride of New York State ; 
They drill so strict the least mistake 
Puts Finn into a

The Finnegan Brigade. 
CHORT;S. 
Now mind me, one, two, three ! 
Shoulder arms ! 
Plaze howld your chin up, Darby Grady, 
Step off free, one, two, three ! 
What do we care if the people stare 
At Finnegan's Brigade ? 
With head erect and shoulders square, 
And step so firm and grand, 
While down the street, the music sweet, 
Plays " Dear Old Paddy's Land 
Oar colors wave and sabres flash 
Bright in the morning sun, 
While bouquets rare are sticking in 
The muzzle of each gun. 
CHORUS. 
March away, mind, I 
say, 
Ain't this fine ? 
Don't spread your feet so, Paddy Carey; 
Now with care, dr€ s

No wonder that the peuple cheer 
The Finnegan's Bil,gade. 
Last Patrick's day we in de a

For keeping time or straighter lines 
No better marching there;

WriEN on the downward hill of life, 
With its story almost told, 
Oh, welcome then each gentle word, 
And kindness to the old. 
The grace of loving tenderness, 
To them a 
blessing dear, 
Will fill their hearts with sweetest joy, 
While the good old folks are here 
CHORITS. 
Then cheer the Old folks with kind words 
Thro' each declining year, 
And let them live in pleasant peace, 
While the good old folks are here. 
Let us smooth their path while drifting on 
To bright eternal day, 
Ere life's uncertain, weary light 
Doth gently fade away ; 
Long time together have they toiled, 
And as the end they near 
We'll soothe their hearts . with dearest words. 
While the old folks are here. 
Then cheer the old folks, etc.

H ARDING. 
I 
AM paying my addresses to a 
lady rich and fair, 
She is very fond of music, she can sing most any air, 
To the Grand Italian Op'ra she was much inclined to go, 
So I made the preparations and we went to see the 
" 
show ;" 
I'm no great judge of music, I 
admire a 
good brass band, 
But these high toned foreign op'raS I can never under-
stand. 
CHORUS . 
There's an elegant soprano, and a 
heavy baritone, 
There's a 
double barrell'd basso with a 
deep and mighty 
groan, 
There's a 
chorus loudly shouting, there a

bland ; 
With fiddles, flutes and kettledrums all gathered in the 
band. 
There I 
sat like one enchanted, and I 
could not move Or 
speak, 
My companion was delighted, but to me it 
was all 
Greek ; 
There was sighing, there was crying, there was singing, 
there was woe, 
And it made me almost crazy when I 
beard the trumpets 
blow 
The tenor sang a 
solo, till his face got very red, 
And when the bass began to bawl I 
thought he'd bust his 
head. 
There's an elegant, etc. 
I 
remained a 
quiet list'ner and my eyes began to close, 
At the height of the performance I was sunk in deep 
repose. 
While unconsciously I slumbered, loudly I began to 
snore, 
Then a 
gentlemanly usher dragged me fainting to the 
door. 
I 
soon came to my senses, and since then I've taken care 
To keep clear of operatics, for they drive me to despair, 
There's an elegant, etc.

I 
wonder who he is? 
I 
saw him pass the window 
for the twentieth time this morning. and he (
lid look so gallant 
and charming in his dashing.,

Alissis is out, 
so I 
thought I 
would take a 
stroll, and perhaps meet him face 
to face. 
Oh, he's so sweet!

Ant—" There's a

There's a 
gay and dashing soldier 
Who I'm sure's in love with me, 
When I 
gaze from out the window 
Oh, his form I'm sure to see! 
lie looks up with smile so winning 
That he steals my heart away; 
And I'm dreaming, ever dreaming 
Of that soldier night and day ! 
Bright soldier boy, give one glance to me, 
And let me hear in loving tones your voice's melody ! 
Bri ,,ht soldier boy, give one glance to ate, 
And I 
will be forevermore as happy as can be!

Sitting at a

As I

For it's all about that husband of mine, 
That rollicking, bothering husband of mine.

No girl so neat as her,

Like Bidalia Jane McCann, 
The elegant Miss McCann, 
I'm sure there not wan, 
That can bate the bon-ton of Bidalia Jane McCann. 
Her education's wonderful, 
She spells and writes by ear, 
She plays the " Maiden's Prairie," 
And she sings " Beloved Ear." 
She says " I 
feel so fatigayed 
I 
don't know what to do." 
Says I, " Bidalia, some grub and ale 
Might help your fatigu." 
Bidalia Jane, etc. 
She gives a " German " ev'ry week, 
An " Irish " too as well. 
She says a 
cork would shade my face, 
So I 
could tend the bell; 
She sings duets all by herself, 
She talks French like a

She's very aurevore indeed,

I'M AS HAPPY AS A BIG BULLFROG. 
As sung by SAN VILLA. 
Words and music by T. BRIGHAM BisnoP. 
I 
ONCE was gay and happy, 
And no one dressed more natty, 
But 0 
that time is gone, 
And I 
am left forlorn ; 
I'm left to rue the day 
I 
came down to the city, 
And met this girl so pretty, 
Endowed with all the art 
To capture my poor heart, 
And with it rim away. 
CHORUS. 
And I'm feeling like a 
big bullfrog, 
Sitting on an old pine log, 
Waiting to be caught, and boiled in a 
pot 
For a 
Frenchman's dinner- day ; 
But I 
never shall forget Aleene, 
Stiching on a 
sewing machine, 
As I 
passed the door of a 
millinery store 
Upon a 
Christmas day. 
I 
once was young and tender, 
My ma was my defender; 
At home I 
was a 
pet, 
And never have as yet 
Had girls such privilege taken ; 
But how can I 
resist her ? 
She said she knew my sister, 
She said my sister Lou 
Was the sweetest girl she knew, 
And loved me for her sake. 
And I'm feeling, etc. 
It is with sorrow laden 
I'm thinking of this maiden, 
Who run off with a 
fop 
That gave her lollipop, 
And rounded on her deal. 
So here I 
am all shaken, 
Just ready to be taken. 
Would any one be pleased 
With a 
lemon that's been squeezed, 
With nothing but the peel ? 
And I'm feeling, etc.

SAMMY 
LIGr. 
From RICE'S opera of •• Evangeline." 
COME, listen to the mournful tale 
That I 
will try to tell to you, 
About a 
sailor, Sammy Snug, 
Who sailed upon the waters blue. 
Meandering one day on the sea, 
Poor Samuel was drowndi-ed, oh ! 
And whenever the ship it left the bay 
On Mozambique or Paraguay, 
He always used one thing to say, 
And this is what he said : 
CHORUS. 
" 0 
the wind is sou-son-en, 
The wind is piping free, 
The wind is blowing, and the ship is going, 
And carrying me away from thee. 
0 
the wind is son-son- en. 
The wind is piping free : 
The wind it is a-blowing 
And the ship it is a- going, 
Would always say Sammy. 
Now Sammy loved a 
gallus girl, 
And she did also love Sam well, 
And spliced they would have surely been 
But for a 
hideous blow as fell ; 
For, sailing one day on the sea, 
Poor Sammy, he was drowndi-ed. 
His messmates who were there that day, 
And grabbled in vain as he sank away, 
Say that some words they heard him say. 
And these are the words he said : 
0, the wind is. etc. 
Now that young girl that Sammy loved 
Took to her bed and sickened, 
And every night at twelve o'clock 
Her heart beats they were quickened, 
For a 
ghost in white stood by her side, 
With seaweeds on his head, oh ! 
And her ma, as in the room did stay, 
The very night that she passed away, 
Swears that a 
few words the ghost did say, 
And these were the words he said : 
0, the wind is,

Would set you wild with pleasure, at the Twilight Coterie,

I'VE often heard it said, that it's nice to be a 
father, 
And have a 
popsey-wopsey of your own ; 
But I'd rather be excused from such a 
little bother, 
Experiences of others I 
have known. 
If any thing will show more plainly than another, 
That George is " off his crank," the reason's plain, 
He's just become a 
dad, and his wife's become a 
mother, 
And they both have got the " baby on the brain !" 
CHORUS. 
The baby, the baby, it's nothing but the baby ! 
They bless it and caress it till it cries with pain ; 
They dance it up and down, and hiss it for it's mother. 
Oh ! it's awful to have a " baby on the brain !" 
How proudly does he tell all his friends that he's a 
daddy, 
And wonders why before they had not known ; 
He whistle and he sings, " with my folderolderaddy, 
And " remember, you have children of your own !"

'• Helen's Babies" have a 
charm, also " Other's People's 
Children," 
He's reads them over time and time again ; 
Oh ! ain't he got it bad, I'm afraid he won't recover 
From that ailment call'd the " baby on the brain !" 
The baby, the baby, etc. 
He's tickled most to death when his friends they all 
admire, 
And say he is the image of his dad ; 
They say he's got his nose, and they anxiously inquire, 
" 
If he's troubled with the collv-wobbles ' bad ?" 
The youngster doesn't. mind the trouble he is making, 
He eats and sleeps, and sleeps and eats again ; 
He's got the thing down fine, and with baby mirth he's 
shaking, 
For he knows his pop's got " baby on the brain !" 
The baby, the baby, etc. 
But the worst thing of it all, is the naming of the baby ; 
Mamma thinks " George Augustus " would be sweet ; 
Papa does not agree, he says " Christopher Columbus ;" 
And to hear the names proposed is quite a 
tr,=,sat. 
They finally agree, he's christened plain 
Augustus !" 
Sweet baby, may your glory never wane. 
Now ladies (pray excuse me), when you are thus afflicted, 
I 
hope you'll not have " baby on the brain !"

THE MAN IN THE MOON .

You all know what this feeling is, 
When at some quiet spot, 
All around you may be ice, 
But the love's burning hot. 
Of course her hand so tight you squeeze 
As you both gaze afar ; 
Yes, while the moon is laughing at you, 
Knowing what fools you are. 
SPOKEN. — When you are in love, and sitting on some 
romantic cliff, with the object of your affections, 
rQmember— 
CHORUS. 
The man in the moon is looking, love ; 
He's blinking, love ; he's winking, love ; 
And each little star can tell where you are. 
The man in the moon is looking. 
The other night, when at Oak Bluffs, 
A 
girl sat there with me, 
The moon above kept peeping out 
With look of naughty glee ; 
I 
whispered tales of love, and said, 
" 
Don't be a 
timid, miss, 
But while the moon's behind a 
cloud, 
Just one sweet little kiss." 
Srox.r.N.—" Not now ; don't you see that man?" 
"What man ?" " Why the man in the moon. 
He's 
laughing at us." " But just one, dear." " No, no !" 
The man in the moon, etc. 
As we sat gazing at the moon, 
Like spoony lovers do, 
My arm of course was round her waist, 
Nigh squeezing her in two ; 
I 
heard the moon say to the stars, 
" 
That pair I'll go and wed," 
And as the moon came from above, 
I 
rolled clean out of bed. 
SPOKEN.--It was a 
dream.

Grandmother's cat was a 
little Thomas, 
And weighed about forty-seven pounds ; 
He was older by half than his little twin-brother, 
And made with his mouth funny sounds ; 
He came in this world on the morning he was born, 
And was always his grandmother's pride ; 
But he kicked once—twice, 
Never to kick again, 
'Cos he was died. 
Nine seconds without slumber, 
Kick, kick, kick, kick, 
Awl he kicked like tunder. 
Kick, kick, kick, kick, 
But he kicked 
Never to kick again, 
'Cos he was died. 
in watching his dear mother catch rats and mice, 
Many days did he pass when a 
kit, 
And in kittenhood and catbood, he thought it was nice 
To hear the little Juices yell and kick ; 
But he didn't think it nice, when he went below the be, 
With his head to a 
little stone tied. 
So he kicked once—twice, 
Never to kick again, 
'Cos he WIN died. 
Nine seconds without slumber, 
Kick, kick, kick, kick, 
And he kicked like tunder. 
Kick, kick, kick, kick,

We meet at night, when stars shine bright, 
Down by the garden gate, 
And fond lips meet, in kisses sweet, 
Until the hours grow late. 
I 
whisper then to her again,

She says to me, I'll always be 
The sunshine of 3

PARODY ON " JOIIN:\.TY MORGA.N. 
Written and Sung by SAM DEVERE. 
The Gordon family of Mulberry street 
Were musical in their way ; 
'Twas worse than a 
bad Dutch band let loose, 
When they would sing and play, 
But Jimmy Gordon took the cake, 
The agony thick he piled, 
When he jerked on the Dutch accordeon, 
lic?cl set the neighbors wild. 
Jimmy Gordon, played the accordeon, 
Causing terrible woe; 
His sister she'd sing dizzy songs, 
The neighbors all went oh—oh—oh—Oh— 
Everywhere you'd hear them swear, 
Good Lord ! how they wou:d frown, 
And yell, " oh, shoot i 
t1" and bang the doors, 
And close the windows down. 
Up on the roof, down in the yard, 
And up and down the stairs, 
All over the house this accordeon and, 
Would slaughter the latest airs. 
One day he tried to play too fast, 
And dislocated his arm, 
And then the Dutch accordeon busted, 
Causing great alarm.

Jimmy Gordon, played the accordeon, 
Seventeen hours a 
day, 
And the neighbors stuffed their ears with rags, 
And the boys all yelled out ha—ha—ha—ha— 
Every night with all his might, 
This exhilerating young sardine, 
Would yank out the most excruciating time, 
From his screeching Dutch machine. 
His sister broke her jaw one day, 
On a 
note she couldn't reach; 
On his front stoop all night he made 
That Dutch accordeon screech. 
'Till some one let a 
chimney fall 
From the roof on to his head, 
Which put him to sleep, and they laid him out 
Upon his little bed. 
CHORUS. 
Jimmy Gordon, played the accordeon, 
As hard as he knew how ; 
Which sent the babies into fits, 
And the shoemakers' dogs went bow-wow—bow-
wow— 
On he went, for his mind was bent, 
And he'd make the accordeon scream; 
On " Home, Sweet Home," he'd work like a 
Turk, 
'Till the sweat poured out in a 
stream. 
?;, 
When Good Folks are at Home and 
Abed. 
Written aml sung by SAm DEVERE. 
Not a 
great while ago I 
was out rather late, 
With a 
friend that I 
happened to meet, _ 
And as we were jo7ging along toward home, 
We saw somy queer sights in the street. 
Now if you have not been out very late, 
No doubt in the papers you've read; 
Of the very queer things that occur late at night, 
When good folks are at home and abed. 
Curled up in doorways and straggling about, 
Were numerous American tramps, 
And lots of young fellows who were full of bay rum, 
Trying hard to hold up the street lamps. 
I 
saw a 
man fired from a 
Dutch beer saloon, 
They put on him a 
terrible head; 
And that's what he got for being out late at night, 
When good folks are at home and abed 
I 
saw lots of couples who were on their way home, 
Perhaps from a 
party or ball; 
And lots of young fellows who were telling nice things, 
And squeezing their girls in the hall. 
I 
saw a 
policeman take a 
drink on the sly, 
And he never put up nary a 
red, 
He made love to the girls in the basement next door, 
When good folks were at home and abed. 
I 
saw strings of cats all along in the street, 
Making love in their own funny way; 
And fellows called night owls who prowl around night, 
And sleep the best part of the day. 
There was nice looking girls fell in love with me, too. 
I'll tell you right here what they said ; 
But stop out a 
night and find out for yourself, 
When good folks are at home and abed.

Take me back to home and mother, 
1 
fun weary wand'ring here, 
There can never be another 
Spot on earth so dear to me. 
Though I 
roam 'mid scenes of splendor, 
Yet my heart is filled with pain, 
And a 
longing, sad and tender, 
Whispers take me back again. 
CHORUS. 
Take me back to home and mother, 
For my heart is filled with pain, 
Take me back to home and mother ; 
Only take me back again. 
Take me back to home and mother, 
To the happy scenes of yore, 
Friends of childhood, sister, brother, 
Long to welcome me once more. 
I 
can hear their voices ringing, 
In sweet memory's refrain, 
To the past my heart is clinging, 
Only take me back again. 
Take me back, etc. 
Take me back to home and mother, 
Gentle words will greet me there, 
For on earth there is no other 
Kindness like a 
mother's care. 
Life is but a 
dream of pleasure, 
Sweetest hours must turn to pain, 
Home is all I 
have to treasure, 
Only take me home again. 
Take me back, etc.

LAST ROSE OF SUMMER. 
M EDLEY No. 5. 
As suug by SAM VILLA. 
'TIE the last rose of summer, 
Left blooming alone, 
All her lovely companions 
Are--
Down in a 
coal mine, 
Underneath the ground, 
Where no ray of sunshine, 
Ever can be,— 
Dreaming of thee, only of thee, 
Still by thy side, love, longing to be, 
And feel as if I'd tumbled into honey, 
Or soniebody'd left me all their money. 
I 
feel so frisky and so funny, 
0 
it's funny when you— 
Kiss me if you dare, and I 
wont say no ; 
Kiss me if you dare, for I 
like it so ; 
Kiss me if you dare, for I'm rather shy ; 
Kiss me if you dare, and I'll let you try. 
Flirting with me, right by my side, 
Longing to ask me if I'll be your bride. 
You take me to a 
saloon, 
And ask me what I'll have, 
But do not notice what I 
eat, 
Until you pay for— 
Roast beef, boiled ham, pickled beets, 
And pie and cheese, plum pudding, wine,— 
I 
tell you it's immen,A)—small beer, sausages, 
Fried eggs and buttered toast, 
Added all together make one dollar fifteen— 
Years of age, I 
was my mother's fair haired boy, 
She kept a 
little huckster's shop, her name it wa$ 
Esmeralda, Esmeralda, Esmeralda Zingara 
Viola Gitana, Viola Gitana, 
Esmeralda, Esmeralda, Esmeralda Zingara. 
PLEASE, ma'am, hear nmy prayerful pleading, 
For my mother's ver:.- poor ; 
I 
have come to ask a 
penny— 
Do not turn me from your door. 
Mother's sick and weak aid feeble, 
And she sent me on the street, 
With my little empty basket, 
For we've nothing home to eat. 
CHORU S. 
Please, ma'am, wont you give me something ? 
I'll not come here any more ; 
God will bless you--wont you please, ma'am— 
Do not turn me from your door. 
Please, ma'am, wait amni let me tell you 
That my father was drowned at sea, 
And my poor heart-broken mother 
Has no children, ma'am, but me ; 
Do not spurn me, do not shun me, 
I'm a 
child and nothing more ; 
Give me something if but pity— 
Do not turn moo from your door. 
Please, ma'am, etc. 
Please, ma'am. j 
ist one moment listen, 
You are rich and 
pre poor; 
T'll go home and say to mother, 
That you turned me from your door. 
Good-bye—we can starve and suffer, 
Yet will look to God end pray 
That when you go to him begging, 
He'll not turn your soul away. 
Please, ma'am, etc, 
THE FISHERS, 
ONE morning, when spring was in her teens— 
A 
morn to a 
pc; . t's wishing, 
All tinted in delicate pinks and greens— 
Miss Bessie and I 
went fishing. 
In my rough and easy clothes. 
With my face at the sun tan's mercy ; 
She with her hat tipped down to her nose, 
And her nose tipped—rice repsq. 
I 
with my rod, my reel and my hooks, 
And a 
hamper -
for luncheon recesses ; 
She with the bait of her comely looks, 
And the seine of her golden tresses. 
So we sat us down on the sunny dike, 
-Where the white pond lilies teeter, 
And I 
went to fishing, like quaint old Ike, 
And she like Simon Peter. 
All the noon I 
lay in the light of her eyes, 
And dreamily watched and waited, 
But the fish were cunning and would not rise, 
And the baiter alone was baited. 
And when the time for departure came 
My bag hung flat as a 
flounder : 
But Bessie had neatly hooked her game— 
A 
hundred-and- fifty pounder. 
ACROSTIC. 
S 
o 
it seems that you never have seen him, 
A 
nd never have heard him sing ; 
M ore's the pity ; if you should hear him, 
V 
cry many of ye 
sorrows'd take wing. 
I 
saw him last Light as Clorinda— 
L 
ovely maid wit,1 the long golden locks. 
L 
aughter followel, and nothing could hinder 
A 
bursting of buttons from fro4ks.

MEDLEY N o. 4. 
Arranged by SAM B. VILLA. 
COME to me quickly, my darling, 
Leave me no longer alone; 
Troubles and sorrows will vanish— 
Only one kiss will atone. 
Heard are thy vows of affection 
Gladly, gladly of late. 
Now given o'er to dejection 
Sadly, sadly, I 
wait. 
Oh ! 
Come to ine quickly, my darling, 
Leave me no longer 
With  
Johnnie Morgan, who plays the organ, 
-Whose father beats the drum, 
His sister plays the tambourine, 
His brother goes porn, porn, porn, porn, porn, porn, 
All alone on a 
big trombone. 
The music was so sweet 
He always got a 
penny to go 
Into another street. 
Johnnie Morgan played the organ, 
His father beat the drum, 
His sister plays the tambourine,

Marching along the crowded street 
To the sound of fife and drum, 
The ladies wave their handkerchiefs, 
And to the windows come. 
They all salute us as we pass, 
And say we are trump cards, 
For well they know the handsome show 
Of the fine Maginnis Guards. 
As down the street we go, 
With colors waving high. 
We ) ear the welcome, shouts, hurrah I 
As we go passing by. 
Oh ! when we're on parade, 
The rest are in the shade, 
They give three cheers, and a 
tiger too, 
For the great Maginnis Guards.

Parody on PinafoT-e_ 
Written by Tilos. 0. DAVIS. 
Sung by KELLY 
the famous 
"liar Is of Tara." 
When I 
was a 
lad I 
sc eyed a 
term, 
As a 
latherer of mugs in a 
barbers firm 
As a 
five cent barbrr I 
soon got sore, 
So I 
got drunk one night when I 
wrote " Pinafore." 
I 
wrote " Pinafore " E 
o 
suceessfullee 
That its sung by all the snides in the country. 
As a 
great composer, I 
made such a 
mark, 
They made me inspector of the tramps in the park ; 
So for fear . tnall pox would destroy their gaul, 
I 
had them vaccinated with a 
cobbler awl. 
And by doing this job so " Komikally" 
They paid for my ferry over to Jersey. 
Between writing and shaving I 
made such a 
name. 
The Widow () livers lawyer I 
soon became ; 
Then 
L!11 led in a 
clothing store with an old galoot, 
That by ttn:ning live aces I 
won the suit. 
Oh, it fit me so quick and looked so 
That I 
sold it for a 
dollar in a 
hash foundry. 
By smoking. old stuniris I 
paralyzed my jaw, 
Then I 
went to rag pieking and a 
hand- cart did draw 
drawed S
c) we :I ar.1 became so smart, 
- 
I 
soon became the r 
wier of a 
hie- ash-cart. 
Now, I 
bored you ... 11 to-niglit so frightfullee, 
rd better rig my " Pinafore " and skip away to sea. 
BUTTERCUPS AND DAISIES. 
W ritten by BOBBY NEWCOMB expressly for W ILL. H. 
MORTON, 
America's Comique. 
W HEN a 
little boy I 
wandered, 'twas a 
pleasant summer's 
day, 
My heart was like a 
feather as I 
journeyed on my way ; 
To my eager footsteps soft the green grass laid, 
With a 
little playmate, such a 
tiny maid, 
Playing I 
was poor man, playing she was rich, 
How her merry laughter reached the highest pitch, 
Pointing to the daisies silver wealth untoi.1, 
Buttercups unnumbered, these she said were gold. 
With the time departing soon the air was chilled, 
Out upon the crisp wind loud the robin trilled ; 
Once again I 
wandered with my little maid, 
To our treasure garden vast in wealth arrayed. 
Soon we knew a 
robber, Jack Frost was his name, 
Had been there before us and taken all our gain, 
With his icy fingers and a 
grasp so cold, 
Stole our silver daisies and buttercups of gold. 
Man's estate I 
reached then, but I 
ne'er forgot 
My little maid companion and our treasure spot, 
For there was a 
lesson in our strange belief, 
Summer was our banker, Winter was our thief.-
So it is with friends, then, sometimes so with all, 
They're true to us in sunshine but leave us in the fall ; 
When a 
warm friend slights me or he treats me cold, 
I 
think of silver daisies and buttercups of gold.
