A PLANTATION PICTITR7.. 
THE harvest, redolent with Nature's 
luxuries, 
teems every green shrub with blossoms rich, varied 
and fragrant, and draws around each tree and plant 
the finest sense and satisfaction of man. 
Imagine 
ourselves early up, out for a morning stroll. 
The 
night sea- breeze has scarcely called home his refresh-
ing breath; the air is clear and each little voice of k 
the chirpers of the " pond- bushes" breaks attractively 
and welcome upon the attentive ear. 
Flit, flit, from 
the night-si,r,mded clumps rise these ever bright and 
attractive foresters. 
Let us ascend the rugged ledge-rocks to the left, 
and remain there, at least until the fiery orb of day 
drives us from our exaltation. 
The eye wanders over a 
broad expanse—the view 
uninterrupted, save where looms up the tall, majestic 
trunks of the cocoa, the 'bushy clusters of the banana 
or the sturdily set-up of the pomegranate. 
Far away, stretch in a 
bed of' yellowish purple, 
vast fields of the productive sugar cane. 
It is in 
bloom, and it sheds a 
gracious sweetness to the morn. 
On the right is the thatched top of Massa's dwelling, 
easily discerned by the gigantic, dark green, and 
tressilated tamarind tree which spreads its vigorous 
arms around, over and beside it, a 
shade from the sun, 
and a 
shelter from the tornado. hark ! the plantation 
bell has just sounded, and straightway totter forth 
the hands, 
In file, under direction of overseers, pro-
I

PANOIZASINA. 
ceed to their daily toil the sable inhabitants of the 
plantation—cutting the sugar cane to supply the mill, 
while others have entered the sugar house and are 
sedulousy employed stirring the boiling juice—the 
source of so much wealth to the planter, and useful-
ness in the economy of the world. 
We will now stroll towards a 
well built man, of an 
appearance of beaten copper, and at his invitation sit 
beside him. " Welcome, ; beautiful day. 
Will 
you not walk into the house. It is seldom my wife 
has the good nrtune to see a 
stranger, and the children 
will be delighted to see you." 
" 
Thank you, sir : it would please me well. I 
have 
wandered since morning admiring your estates, and 
the attractions of the neighborhood." 
" 
Anne, dear, I 
have brought, by the kind action of 
circumstances, you a 
friend who is out looking upon 
the beauties of a 
Southern plantation." 
" 
You are welcome, sir." 
Night comes on—the Western sky :s 
tinged with 
lights of gold and blue, and miniature auroras. 
The 
chirpings, carols and merry times of the birds are 
hushed ; the river water gurgles louder, the mill is 
still, but the sugar house kettles are in full blast, 
• 
the cows are on their way home—mules are returning 
to their fold, the negroes have entered their huts, 
where patiently they sit till the moon cheers their 
lonely natures, and then, then is the most happy mo. 
ments they enjoy. 
Young and old, stiff and nimble, 
gather upon the lawn and blow their outrageous 
corn-doodle, ( to them them fine music) play up their 
bulky drums, fife, whistle, and dance. 
Their eccentricities are side splitting, their mani-
festations of glee ridiculous. 
From these moments of 
humor has the genius of minstrelsy plucked the powers 
of his argument and extended the visions of Thespis. 
Yours, truly, 
J. B.

IT

The Slave's Refrain. 
BY J. BARBOUR. 
Age stops me in my walk of life, 
And with a

Quells fitful passions in their strife;

'Tis sad my fate, I 
oft opine 
The joys of life should fade. 
I 
glance within my children's eyes, and find 
My life iii them is stayed.

they fade; 
in garbs of dolor how oft arrayed.

The lessons of grief I 
early knew, 
For I 
was loved and lovely once; 
My wife from my breast they madly drew, 
And sold her from my yearnim glance. 
Two infants, like roses in a 
desert sprung, 
Cheered on my lonely course, 
And from my bosom passions wrung 
That burned sacred in their course. 
CHORUS : Dreams of youth, SLe. 
Give me back the hopes and joys 
Which radiant o'er me hung ; 
Restore the sweet which mind employs, 
And teach me the songs I 
sung. 
All,— they are not forgotten yet; 
But heart's true melody's fled. 
Let my eyes the sweet blue of Sarah meet, 
Then lay me with the silent dead.

(ifrastix Bust.) 
Soft angle of hope! she stays my hours; 
Strews my rough path with sweet flowers; 
(leers the day from sunset till morn 
With the song of—the dinner horn ! 
She lives in a 
palace with laces environed; 
She has horses and carriages all ironed; 
She has identy of employment to make life happy 
She washes de clothes of gen'lem and—pappy. 
She's blooming and fresh: she's young and fair, 
Of sweet starry eyes she posFesses a 
pair; 
Her feet are as small as a 
Chinese belle's, 
She has—fits by starts and by spells. 
No despair e'er sits on her marble brow; 
No canker-worm care does she ever allow 
Oil the sweet rose of her affections to feed,— 
She fills up the empty spot—wid weed. 
44 Peter, can you trust to my honesty?" 
44 
Oh no, I 
can't; you borrowed my watch the oder 
day, an you forgot to bring it back; but, I 
don't 
oare, I 
bought anoder one. I 
lent it to a 
man de oder 
night about free o'clock in de mornin.

" Why not ?"

was berry dark, an he axed me if I 
wouldn't lend him 
my watch. 
I

"
,And you never saw him before?"

gs Why, how stupid." 
"Oh no, I

big club in his hand."

She has a 
lover, and he is furious in love ; 
He hugged her one night, an eall'd ner his dove, 
But she softly protested, this sweetest of maids; 
lie should know better—than rumple her braids. 
She sat for her portrait, he went to the painters; 
He brought her a 
carriage driven by one :daynte.1 
They got in the carriage, this lover alai 2diss; 
He fainted ; she revived him with one sweet—kibs.

I'se walking thro' the street one day, 
With a

I 
accidentally met my lub. 
Site sel,

I 
tried to tell her how it was; 
But oh I 
she got so mad, 
She says, now you may think it does, 
But as it is, 
glad. 
Cuonus : Now don't go away my Clementine, 
But do let Inc explain ; 
The case is plainly to be seen 
if you will but remain. 
She would not listen unto me, 
But hasteu'd right away, 
And straigt to her papa to see, 
To hint these words to say— 
Ah ! dear papa! do not think strange 
Of what I'm gwine to do. 
The country now I'm gwine to range, 
lVy fortune to pursue.

For grief has got poor Peter fast ; my stomach's full 
oh fears, 
My heart jumps up an down so quick, when Massa 
calls my name, 
Dat de niggers shake dere heads an cry, poor Peter's 
not de same. 
Oh! 1

wid joy, 
De gals turn'd up dere eyes an sigh, oh what a

'Till on one dark and fatal day, Black Tom, the vil-
lage beau— 
He ran away wid 'filly Greene, an stole my banjo.

tilVd wid woe ;. 
Oh! dat Black Tom! oh! Tilly Greehe! an

De moon shone like a

In fury kick de panel in, and hit him in de eye. 
Wid dat de black nigger 'gin to roar, an grabb'd my

Yes, so do I. 
Oh ! Professor, what do you think 
ob love ?"

Well, Peter, its a 
very strange and strong passion 
belonging to animate nature." 
" 
Yes, sir, it is. 
I 
know you are berry well versed 
in dese matters—dat is, you know all about dem, as 
you am gen'lvn of extrftragant au4rology ; but why 
you shoubl throw yourself on your own circiunferencii

Well, love it is—it is—'tis ellectricical form on 
account of the 'trinsic value that is attached to the 
aforesaid distinctions of the two persons what's be-
trothed to be married, and of course if you look at it 
in de light you should, you'll obsarve there's a 
picu-
liarity to the benevolent society of your own sufficient 
a—a--beats there a 
heart." 
I 
see, sir, by the trying experience you have 
passed through, you are without a 
knowledge of the 
matter at all—that is—muddled." 
"Eugh I 
muddled who ? muddled me! I would 
raise my hand—my hand ob infinite courage—to de-
fend the weakness ob a 
delicate lawyer—from Ar-

Virginia's Land. 
Dark and black was de night, an de wild rolling 
storm 
Howled fearfully loud o'er valleys and sand, 
As a 
nigger rushed forf wid his breast beating warm, 
For de gal dat he bibbed in Virginia's bright land. 
CHORUS: Fast, fast run de dark 
As he scatter'd de sand, 
For de gal dat he lubb'd, 
In Virginia's bright land. 
Loud, loud roared de wind, and de midnight was 
near. 
As faster dis darkey rushed ober de sand. 
I'm off, I'm off, cried de nig wid a 
tear, 
To de gal dat I 
tubbed in Virginia's bright land,

And dus to young Jenny he cried, 
Clear de dishes away, lub, I'll be back wid all speed, 
To make k

He fled and she waited; but false, false was he, 
Ober de left ebery promise he sword, 
Some other he married, for Jenny to see 
The dark serenader no more. 
CHORUS: His loss she'll deplore, 
As she sits by de shore, 
Where de low sullen waters do roar. 
She soon heard de news, but scorned it she sed, 
While sorrow fast seized on her brain ; 
Her look got so wild, and her physiog displayed 
A 
tempest of madness and pain. 
She trembled and trembled, while blacker grew she, 
Her fingers her woolly locks tore. 
Den smiling she swoon'd, doom'd nebber to see 
De dark serenader no more. 
CHORUS: His loss, &c. 
She died like de tempest on a 
fine summer's day, 
And lifted her head nebber more:

JORDAN. 
BY T. VAUGHN. 
Of New York and its ways, it has been these latter 
days 
The custom of our poets to be hard on; 
But to set the matter right is my business here to 
night, 
And I'll show you row the other side of Jordan. 
Take off my coat, & c. 
True, now and then, there is found a 
dishonest man 
around, 
And for garroters you must ever be your guard on, 
But if you don't get tight, you can travel day or 
night 
On any road you please over Jordan. 
Take off my coat, & c. 
The laws are a 
little queer, but we've new ones eve-
ry year, 
And with dimes for every crime there's a 
pardon; 
Only show the police the chink, and at your capers 
they will wink, 
Till you're good and safe on Vother gide of Jordan. 
Take oil my coat. & c. 
If you happen to want a 
job to enable you to rob 
The city of the gold it's been hoarding, 
Merely tell the powers that be, you can offer them no 
fee, 
But a 
purse is at their option over Jordan. 
Take off my coat, &c. 
We've fashions of all kinds, with amusements for all 
minds, 
And music from the banjo to the organ; 
We've churches built for prayer, where folks show 
their gear, 
And the parson preaches anything but Jordan. 
Take off my coat, &c. 
But with all its faults you'll roam a 
mighty long way' 
from home, 
Ere a 
city like New York you're a- board on; • 
For tho' many things be ill, there's enough of good 
ones still 
To carry him in triumph over Jordan.

"'Well, ma'am,' sez I, 'de las regulation am

Well, sir,' sez she,

Dere's no decessity for dat, ma'am,' sez I.

"'Case,' sez I,

" Well,' sez she, 
we'll take yeu in.' 
"'1 tink dat will be mutual, ma'am,' sez I. 
Ha I 
ha! Jem—dat was a 
take in, indeedee! 
Well, Jem, in 
de ebenin, bein obercum wid fatwigs ob de day, I 
was 
shown to my chambre in de attic; but I 
tole dem to 
be particular an gib me a 
room whar dere was no 
bugs; so, dey sed dere wasn't a 
single bugs in de 
house, see? 
Yah, yah! I 
soon found out dey tole de 
truf for dere wasn't a 
single bug--dey war all mar-
ried an had large families. 
I 
tole dem dey must 
change my sleepin apartments; dat I 
didn' mind de 
bugs so much, but de fact was dat I 
hadn't got de 
blood to spare. 
One mornin a 
boy came an fotch'd 
me a 
pair ob boots for my own, one leg ob which was 
longer clan de oder. 
I 
axed him how it cum dat dey 
wasn't ob de same lengf? 
He sed he didn't know— 
didn't make 'em—but what bother'd him de most was, 
dat de pair down stairs was in de same perfixment. 
Well, I 
got on de boots, an went down stairs to break-
fast, an when I 
got dere I 
found de boarders had al-
ready assembled, an dere, in de centre of de table was 
for breakfast a 
leetle piece of bean, yer could jes dis-
kubber wid a 
spy-fly-glass. 
Now, help yerself to 
bean,' sed de lan'lady, 
don't be affraid.' I 
tole her 
no, I 
wasn't affraid, dat I 
had seen a 
piece twice as 
large, an it didn't frighten me a 
bit,' 
Well, when de 
dinner time cum. you orter seen de table. 
Ah! urn

SABLE SONGSTER. 
41 
144 Well, I 
rather guess it was, dey had been fur 
dinner ebery Sunday. 
Well, at de dinner your orter 
seen de luxumraries ;—dere was stewed cat steak 
serbed up in bean's oil, raw crockadile, monkey's 
feet, broiled flunkies, wid leader pickles, homicidal 
puddins and arsenical soups an all de so foorfs. 
De 
soups good, eh! eh l—fust rate: dey take a 
quart oh 
water an boil it to a 
point to make it strong. Fust rate 
sassengers, too, an all dat am necessary for de enjoy 
ment of dem is confidence; dats all. 
Sawdust pudclin 
anfried scrubbin brushes was among delicasums. 
Ebery boarder was requested to tak his meals afore 
a 
lookin glass; dey did dat to double de quantity on 
de plate; but I 
went down in de kitchen, an dar I 
spied a 
darkey wid his slebes rolled up, clivin in de 
pot. 
What am yer coin dar? said 1. 
I 
am divin 
down for to find de skin of de bean wat stuck to de 
pot, sez he. 
Anoder ting was when you had'nt squared up yer 
board, dey would lay an extra fork on yer plate, as 
much as to say, 
fork ober." 
Help yourself to but-
ter,' sed de missus. 
I 
begged her to 'souse me as I 
had just jined de temperance 'sciety, an it was ' gainst 
my principles to take anything strong. I 
had per-
eebed, Jem, dat it was bery rank when dey fotched 
it in de door. 
I 
golly! it was so strong it took two 
horses, free boys and a 
driber to hold it in de wagon; 
and when it was put on de plate I 
was nearly fright-
end to deaf lest it would knock me down. 
Now it was tea time: de tea was so weak dat it 
would run out ob de spout ob de kittle, and de bread 
was so hard dat dey had to break it wid a 
crow-bar, 
and had to get a 
mater stone-cutter to superintend 
de operation. Well, fur supper dey had clam soup wid 
short cake, an ascernomical beans, wat dey keep fur 
factorin corporation landnis. 
Dere was salt 'nuff in 
dem beans to make a 
camel leopard shak wid de 
blind staggers. I 
eat plenty ob clam soup. 
Yes, 1 
eat so much ob de clam soup dat my toe nails hab 
been sheddin clam shells eber since dat. 
At de table 
42 
CHARLEY FOX'S 
a 
feller entered inter conversation wid me ; an I 
axed 
him if he wouldn't be so kind as to inform me, as I 
was a 
new arribal an somewhat 'gusted, as to what 
-was de bissness or 'fession ob de oder gerulem board-
ers? when he proceeded to obsarbe dat de gemlem 
opposite, wid a 
forbidden countenance, was an auc-
tioneer; de oder two gen'lem engaged in conbersation, 
make dere libbin by swearin for it. I 
axed him how ? 
He sed dey bailed men out ob prison by swearin dey 
owned all de corner lots in town—(muddy bisness!) 
Fur myself, sed he, I 
am libbin on hopes--witch I'd 
recommend to you as a 
good idee while provisions am 
so high! [a 
good idea] Why, look at me, sed he, 
Young man free years ago I 
wasn't worf a 
cent, an 
now, see whar I 
am. Why, frough my own exertions 
I 
ave four dollars, 
Aye, sir, look at dat, and cheer 
up! an he proceeded to inform me dat if I 
knew ob 
any young lady dat am anxious to marry, to tell her 
dat she could hab him probided she could support him 
in de style in which he had been accustomed to lib, 
which was, free meals a 
day, a 
plug ob tobarchy a 
week, and a 
clean shirt fur Sundays. 
Look out fur 
de oder boarders case dey may want to impose on you. 
lloweber, I'll stand yer friend- 1'11 take yer part,— 
and I 
golly! he did, for while I 
was talkin he took 
all my part oh de dinner off de plate, after which, he 
arose, and sed dat he had free cents, so he would walk 
down de street, as he always liked to hab a 
paper 
after tea. 
I 
axed him what paper ? 
He sed a 
paper 
ob tobarchy. 
Well, de rest oh de boarders all oh a 
sudden was taken wid de shakes, caused by so much 
salt in de beans. 
Oh! how (ley shook; one nigger 
shook so hard dat he shook all de pegs out ob his 
boots, 
Anoder one shook so hard dat he had to ram 
a 
eorn cob in his mouf, to keep hissef from shakin his 
teeth out; I 
myself did not consperience any sensa-
tion oh de kind until 1 
had retired to my chambre in 
de attic, and bein obercome wid de fatwigs oh de day, 
soon fell into a 
deep slumber, when I 
was seized wid

dat it jarred de babies in de room beneaf, out ob

when de ceilin gub way an fell on all de million 
boarder's heads beneaf—woke up de roosters in Con-
necticut—made de boarders start up in wild alarm, 
cubbered wid dust and lime, an—an dere har full ob

Be 
heads ob dein boarders, after de ceilin fell, was de 
ugliest, scuriest an sabagest sights 1 
eber seen or 
'spects to see in dis world any how. I 
dreams ob it

wall den made up his mind he had too fur to jump, 
kum back agin wid out turnin round, tumble de bris-
tles all ober, as de butter, so mighty in strenft, hit 
him in de face and went right froo his jaw. 
He got 
up an run de carbin knife into hissef, clar up to de 
handle, fur to try de butter all de way down, an so 
he died. 
Anoder nigger came a 
rushin forf wid de 
hind end ob his galluses wrapped round his neck, 
wid de tail ob his coat bruk loose an flew up in de air 
firtty feet, an still raisin an blazin like a 
comet; his 
breeches hung loose on de front side like a 
forked 
apron, while de sittin part was Mowed to kingdom 
cum; his face was as black as a 
pot, 'ceps a 
white 
ring under de eyes, an he kept lookin ober his shoul-
der ebery minit, as if he 'pected to see de debble. 
Well, he spread hissef, an rushed for de yard wid his 
busted breeches' legs a swingin after him, run his 
head frough a 
board fence and hollared, fire! fire 
but de ole lanlady—you orter seen her. 
I'll neber

Well, Shy,

The Smoker. 
Now a

It's about a 
colored man, such a 
bery great smoker. 
He smoked away from de night till de morn— 
'Tis sed dat he smoked as soon as born.

Den listen to dis song dat I'll sing about dis moke, 
And when you've heard me frough you'll say it ends

He tried de Habanah—de Cuba, too; 
All kinds ob towbac,eo, but none would do; 
'Case to please him none ob dem did seem, 
So he got a 
cigar to smoke by steam. 
CHORUS: Den listen to dis song, ar.c. 
He lit his cigar and he puffed de smoke 
Wid such a 
force dat de winders broke 
And den de heat it was so strong, 
Pat it burnt de folks as he went along. 
CHORUS: Den listen to dis song, dm 
It burnt away to his heart's desire— 
Some folks thought de world on fire; 
And if he went out while de wedder rained. 
Dis nigga's cigar dried it up again. 
CHORUS: Den listen to dis song, (tc. 
He smoked till he thought he should suspire, 
But death appeared and quenched his fire; 
He put out his light for bit ob a

And den extinguished dis smoking dark.

As if dey was mustard lozengers instead. 
Now when I

Bet would gib it. ob de soothin lozenges a

quarter before six. 
Professor, dere was de awfullest 
confusion dat day you eber seen in all yer life. 
You 
see dis train ob cars wat I 
was in, an anoder train ob 
cars wat somebody else was in,—an you know, an 
both ob dose train ob cars came togeder—an you see 
before dey cum togeder dey was comm n 
down de road 
from de'oposite direction from one anoder, and wen 
dey struck, eugh !—it actually—it actually made me 
feel sick, and you see—de mocusslotion busted, and 
kind a 
raised all de passengers up in de elephants"— 
" 
In de elements, sir. 
" 
Eh, eh! an wen I 
was twenty miles up in de ele-
ments I 
met a 
man cummin down, wid a 
valise under 
his arm, and I 
axed him how much larder it was, and 
he sed, go on, I've been. 
So Professor, I 
went up 
twenty miles furder, and wen I 
got up dere—I—I was 
at a 
loss to conceit wherefore I 
should be precipitated 
widout habin any notice ob de forthcomin,—dat is to 
say, widout habin any little hint ob it, you see, by 
which I 
might—might defend myself to protest against 
any such proceedings dat would elevate a 
man's con-
degriffs ob de privateer; an so, ob course, when I 
was 
up dere it looked rader gloomy dere. 
You see de 
moon has jest broke forf as I 
reached dere. 
I 
dis-
cubberal Barnum—ere I 
speak false, he was dere— 
hangin on moon by his coat tail. As I 
passed him he 
wanted to know if 1 
wouldn't be so kind as to black 
his boots, and I 
told him, no, I 
guessed not; I 
didn't 
hab time as my intentions was to go a 
few stories 
higher to see if I 
could see anyting of de American 
Cousin." 
" 
Ah, Peter, what do you mean by the American 
Cousin 'I" 
" 
I 
don't mean dat—I mean—Bu-cusin, Bu-eusin." 
" 
No, Buchanan." 
" 
I 
think so. 
Wal, as I 
had heard from foreign re-
ports dat he was some whar in de Medatorial Sea."

CILARLEY Fox's 
an I 
felt rader damp, but den you know a 
feller must 
not notice any sich trifles, you know, when he am on 
de descendency, because it would hab a course to 
frow dem back, whereby dey would enable demselbes 
to look frow a microscope wid deminutive courage, 
an as 1 
was passin through de visions ob hope a 
squeal 
ob mine struck me--" 
" 
A 
squall of wind." 
" 
I 
think so. 
It struck me, and it knocked me off 
ob my innocent perseverence, dat is to say, it hit me 
on my larboard hatch, an it raised me ober carelessly, 
and my heart fluttered in de breeze, because 1 
had 
been leanin against an oak tree dat was on my left." 
" 
There are no trees up there." 
" 
Did I 
say a 
tree ?" 
" 
Yes ; you said an oak tree." 
" 
I 
did—I 
did! did 1 
mention de wood oak tree ?" 
" 
Of course you did, sir." 
" 
Eugh ! As an alderman, I 
am unawares ob eber 
makin such a 
remark which would lead you to tink 
dat for de last half hour I 
hab tole you one word 
which would decipate from my affidavit." 
" 
My dear sir, I 
don't doubt you in the least; I 
was only astonished at such an anomaly in nature." 
" 
As a 
lawyer, what was dat last remark you made 
use ob, sir?" 
" 
Anomaly, I 
suppose you refer to." 
" 
A 
nomily—a nomily! ha! golly! dats made one 
ob my teeth loose. 
Well, as I 
was a 
sayin, when I 
saw Buchanan he was sittin on de moon playin de 
ole banjo; I 
think he was singin " blow ye winds ob 
mornin," an it was berry high, and ob course he was 
poorty high himself, as he might suppose, an while 
we was talkin 'bout our former years, &c., 
An beats 
dere a 
heart," dere was a Mediterranean streak ob 
wind dat raised us, an landed us on de oder side ob de 
Gulf ob Mexico, " An all was calm !" but to our as-
tonishment we accidentally met Queen Vic, an she 
was singin a 
fling. I 
tole Buchanan dat I 
would racier 
sling a

Oh yeth, ob course you know I 
wouldn't say any-

De fact is my 
parients always says no." 
" 
Oh, I 
know you wouldn't." 
" 
Oh, no, ob course! 
Oh, den we met dose folks 
way up day on Pikes Peak, you know Massa, Strak-

Greesi, Smith O'Brien and Massa Ullman—an me an

" 
You and Bake? why, who do you call Buke ?" 
" 
Why Buke—cannon!" 
" 
Peter, you should be more respectful." 
" 
Why, he is as good as I 
am if he only behave his-
set Buchanan, he had his banjo wid him, an I 
axed 
him if he had any tar so we could black up. Well, I 
sent Buke round de corner—de Dutch grocery, you 
know—to get some tar, an he said he couldn't find any 
tar, so he brought me a 
dark eyed sailor, an dis dark 
eyed sailor he fotched some tar an we we all blacked 
up."

Well, Peter, with such great talent I 
presume 
you formed a

Oh, yeth. 
Miss Vic. she played a

When in their sunny bowers, spring birds rejoice, 
Mingling with budding flowers love's gentle voice. 
Grief to thy memory tuneth a

Lovely departed one, sweet Lilly Ray ! 
When liquid melody falls on my ear,

But when a

Sadly I

Fond breezes, wooingly, played with her hair, 
And to my dreaming heart, whispering, say, 
Lovely departed one.

Of all the girls that are so smart, 
There's none like pretty Sally 
She is the darling of my heart, 
And she lives in our Alley. 
There's not a

Who's half as sweet as Sally. 
She is the darling of my heart, 
And she lives in our Alley. 
Of all the days are in the week, 
I

And that's the day that comes 
Between a 
Saturday and Monday; 
For then I'm dress'd in all my best, 
To walk abroad with Sally. 
She is the darting etc., 
My master and the neighbors all, 
Make game of me and Sally, 
And, but for her, I'd better be

But when my seven long years are out 
Oh ! then I'll marry Sally. 
And then how happily we'll live, 
But not in our Alley.

Fox's Wants. 
If you think it will make you all merry, 
I'll sing you a 
song about wants; 
Though ob wit I'm sure I 
want plenty, 
For certain dat wid me is quite scant. 
But a 
woman widout any tongue 
Nebber can scold bery loud, 
And a 
man both deaf and dumb, 
Can make no great noise in a 
crowd. 
CHORUS: Den sound loud de bones and banjo, 
Just list to de song dat I 
sing, 
And hear de vibrations I'm makin 
While so lightly I 
pick on de string. 
A tar, wid no shot in his locker, 
May wander nobody cares whither, 
An there no greater want to a 
cobbler 
Can be, than his want of leather. 
A 
man, if he wants but a 
leg, 
Will make but a 
pitiful runner; 
An if he should chance want an eye, 
IIe'll sure make a 
very bad gunner. 
Cnonus: Den sound loud, &c. 
A

Perhaps may be wanting a

And a

Wants grace—or else I'm a

Sure must prove very bad beer; 
So a

She like a

A

Cnottus: Den sound loud, &c. 
A ploughman widout any plough, 
1 
think he may live at his ease; 
Yet a

Will not make much butter or cheese. 
A 
farmer widout any corn 
Can neither give, sell nor lend; 
But a 
man who is wanting a

his wife mayhap will stand him a

few tender speeches, 
When who should I 
see but my dear, 
Wid a 
gruff lookin dark in brown breeches; 
I 
swore, an he squar'd up to me, 
Gabe me a 
hit which made me squeak loud enough; 
Says he, come along—can you fight ? 
Says I, why I 
haven't got cheek enough. 
Next day, as I 
walked down de street, 
By the police I 
quickly was pounced on; 
When there I 
sord my dear with a 
child— 
A 
regular fat boy—a 
bouncin one. 
She sed that it's parient I 
was, 
And de young brat " daday" did squeak enough. 
Says I, Sir, entire I 
disclaim it, 
For pon my word I 
hadn't cheek enough.

You'll own this was a 
terrible affair; 
My passion completely was fired at it; 
But my tale I'll bring to an end, 
Lest you should begin to tire of it. 
Modest men on their merits are dumb, 
Boasters oft in sayings will speak enough; 
I 
hope there's none such now about, 
Yet I 
trust dey hab all got cheek enough. 
The rish Bob. 
In old Nantucket was I 
born— 
My mudder sold whale oil, and father blew de horn. 
Hear him blow! blow! 
The fishers were the men for me— 
The gals were those of Patie. 
Oh! thus they spoke. 
CHORUS: Oh! Nantucket Dan, 
You are the man 
That should be servant to me; 
Ha! ha! 
One day to the sea shore I 
sped, 
And dropp'd a 
line just under the eve of a 
shed; 
Ah! a 
pull, pnll! 
Overboard I 
fell right in the swell. 
I 
heard a 
soft voice sweetly tell, 
Be easy dear! 
Oxon-us 
Oh! Nantucket Dan 
You are the man, 
That should my company be. 
Yes, yes! 
I 
replied, my maid 'tie too bad 
I 
should be regarded by you as a 
cod— 
For your Tom, Tom. 
And I'll secretly say that I'm shivering, 
Like any tender hearted silvering 
That swims along. 
SABLE SONGSTER.

CHORUS: Oh! Nantucket Dan, 
You are the man 
That led to distraction. 
Nay, of that I'm more than secure, 
And to distracting the gals my conscience is pure— 
Very pure, pure, pure! 
Take care, you nigger man, Billy Briskin said, 
That girl is my bob, to the sea she's bred; 
I'll mash your pate, pate! 
CHORUS: Pat gal is my wife— 
She's half of my life, 
Till the fishes pull her in two. 
Runaway Darkey. 
Oh! why did I

Astonishing Nose. 
Came, listen to me, a 
tale I'll disclose, 
About an ole fig wid a 
bery long nose— 
Eke an elephant's trunk it reached to his toes, 
An wid it he would gib some most astonishing blows. 
CHORUS: Den don't you suppose 
flat I'm goin to blows, 
'Case I 
now speak ob dis wonderful nose. 
This wonderful nose he could swing left and right, 
An I 
golly ! it looked a 
most comical sight: 
No one dare come near, so great was his might, 
For a 
blow from his nose would settle dem quite. 
Cuonus: Den don't you suppose, &c.

Wid a

He used to lie in his bed, wid his nose on de floor„ 
An when he slept sound his nose it would snore 
Lik a 
dog in a 
fight—'twas a 
wonderful nose, 
An it follows him about wherever he goes. 
CHORUS: Den don't you suppose, &c. 
De police arrested him one morning in May, 
For obstructing de sidewalk, having his nose in de 
way. 
Dey took him to de court house, dis member to fines 
When dey got dere de nose hung on a

Maggie Gray. 
BY J. BARBOUH. 
Down in a 
dell where the bubbling waters swell, 
From out the rocks on the grassy hill side, 
eath an elm that drooping hangs, to tell 
Something chilly to the heart, does abide 
The ashes of sweet Maggie Gray. 
CHORUS: No more shall ardors flash 
Speed from 'neath that eye-lash; 
No more, as sun rise o'er the vale, 
Will sweep the smile that did trail 
Round the lips of dear Maggie Gray. 
Beside the towering elm, umbrageous cypress grew, 
To bar without the wind that boisterous moans. 
And fix an awe-fed reverence to herds that low, 
And on the evening zephyrs heave their groans. 
O'er the grave of sweet Maggie Gray. 
CHORUS: No more shall, &c.

Land of beauty, land of sorrow, must I 
bid thee then 
farewell. 
Dark will rise the coming morrow, breaking eve-
ry hallowed spell; 
Friends that love me, ties that bind me, 
Though I 
never see ye more. 
Distant days, and years shall find me, 
Pining for my native shore, 
Pining for my native shore, 
Erin, farewell. 
Erin, farewell. 
Wert thou all my prayers would have thee, 
Beauteous Erin, wert thou free! 
I 
should sorrow less to leave thee, 
Thou, who art the world to me ; 
But to leave thee in thy sadness, 
Ill becomes a 
son of Thine ! 
But ' tis not for scenes of gladness, 
I

Thou, who wert the Queen of Nations, 
Second Athens of the world, 
True in all the heart's relations, 
Yet at thee the bolt was hurled. 
Hurled by those whom thou hadsttrusted, 
Those who pledged the cup with thee, 
Oh ! that Erin's sword had rusted, 
England, ere t'was drawn for thee, 
England, ere ' twas drawn for thee,

BY J. BARBOUR. 
Grief! how sounds that spell of sorrow and of pain! 
How wakes our souls in long and sad refrain: 
Our childhood's starry hours are dimly traced 
Upon the future's sky, a 
stormy gathering waste; 
While every bud of life held dear. decays 
In the blast of that one word—alone. 
A 
mead skirted streamlet glides on and on; 
Its deep channel amid the rocks are worn; 
A 
beech tree breaks the golden rays alone, 
And shelters a 
fair maiden from her home. 
Grief palls her heart—grief dews her eye, 
And she doleful sighs—alone, alone! 
Scarce fifteen summers o'er her has sped; 
The flowers of youth, once bright, are dead. 
Her tale she mutters to the wandring breeze, 
As her spirits rise and fall, as do the seas. 
She looks abroad on her friends in coffins laid, 
And through a 
mist of tears she cries—alone. 
She has parted with those she held so dear; 
Her aching heart in anguish is stretched on their 
bier;

CHARLEY rox's 
And with a 
weary groan to Heaven she sighs, 
Woes which the heart broken alone may surmise; 
They're deeper than mortals ever wish to know. 
The waters rush on, but she sighs—alone.
