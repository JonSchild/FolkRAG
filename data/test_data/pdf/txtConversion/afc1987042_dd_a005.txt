Tape begins with Roger (Informant):
R:  Now in some (--)
D:  I want you to take this.
R:  In some of the very first pages of uh, of "Memory Babe" Gerald Nicosia says that the nuns 
gave Jack a beating that he never forgot.  No, no.  You know that too?  [D:  Yeah]  The nuns 
didn't go after the kids who were, who were shy.  They went after the kids who couldn't sit down 
and had, were always jumping.  They said, "keep quiet!"  Why?  Because they had eighty kids in 
the classroom.  And if one of you started making a disturbance, well how could she manage all 
of, all eighty of them?  And Jack wasn't that type.  Even in real life as an adult he was a shy kid.  
The shy kids are not the ones who get snapped on the knuckles with their "claquettes".  They're 
not, you know that.  
D:  I think I certainly do.  And I remember, [R:  man] remember that very well.
R:  Right.  [D:  Yeah]  Those god damn claquettes.  Oh do I remember them.  I'm trying to get 
one of them.  [D:  Now]  Weezle one of them out of, out of the nun.  [Chuckles]
D:  Now what, now that's interesting.  We didn't (--)  Now the teachers in, the nuns in our school 
used rulers.  Now what, what was a claquette?
R:  A claquette was, well here's the way the nuns used them.  They, they were little snappers 
made out of wood.  You know, if they snapped once you got up.  Snapped twice, you sat down.  
Snapped three time, you knelt down, or whatever.  There was a, a whole symbol behind the, the 
snappers the way they did it.  And some were nice you know.  Long, and they had little designs 
on them I remember.  And they, they knew how to use them.  Sometimes they'd [makes "ch ch" 
sound] snap you on, on the knuckles with them.  I know one of them, uh, Bob [Charidon?], we, 
we talked about it a week ago at the Pawtucketville Social Club.  And he says, "boy he says, you 
know he says, oh here he says, clink."  And he says, "put it on, he says, snap me with the 
claquette on the face."  But he was, he was one of those kids that really was, he was hard to 
manage.  [D:  Yeah]  He always has been!  Even now as an adult he's hard, you know?  You and 
me, we were the shy type probably.
D:  That's right.  That's right, yeah.
R:  You know, the nuns never hit us, but we know that they did.  They hit some kids.  [D:  Yeah]  
But they didn't hit Jack.  Jack's not the kid.  He was an angel.  [Chuckles]
D:  Uh huh.  Yeah, yeah.  You know it's really, it's, I think it's important what you're saying about,
about the whole thing.  About Nicosia and all of that.  That, that I really get the sense in Lowell 
that okay, it's all right if, it's all right if people in Lowell bad mouth Lowell, but there's just this 
tremendous pride underneath it all, you know?  And don't you know, if you're from the outside 
don't you go bad mouthing Lowell, cause you don't know what it's about.  
R:  Isn't that true about your family too?  [D:  Sure]  Yeah.  The wife who's going to berate her 
husband because he goes out drinking, but don't let anybody come over and tell her that he 
drinks.  No.  I can say it because he's mine.  There's a validity to that.  In the sense that he, you 
know, (--)  I don't believe Doug that this is the time for controversy.  There's a guy that was 
sitting there if you remember, he says, "well maybe it's, you know, it would be good if we had 
controversy and diversion of ideas.  No, we're going to dedicate a park to the guy.  Now is the 
time to, to say nice things about Lowell and true things.  And say true things about him too.  You 
know? 
     No.  Uh, the information that I have (--)  Oh, I have his fifth grade teacher.  I see him, he's at 
that monastery.  And I think that he should be invited to this, because he remembers him.  He's 
got pictures of him and everything that he, he shared with me.  This is 66 West Street.  Okay?  
Right, this one right here.  [D: Which one?]  Right here.  [D:  the one on the corner?]  Yeah, 
yeah.  66.  
D:  This one here on the corner.  Uh huh.
R:  This over here is the Dr. Sax house with the wild parties.  Okay.  This is taken from "Dr. 
Sax".  All right.  Here is is.  "The noise of the big family parties could only be heard faintly up in
Joe's fourth story attic, but oh, when it was at my house the cottage on West Street earlier, or later
on, wow!  The woops and screams of the ladies as "Mad Cap Duquette" would get Blanche to 
put all the lights out and start playing spooky music on the piano.  Up riseth the face powdered in
white flour, framed in an empty picture frame with flashlight under chin."  [Makes ghost sounds: 
oogoogoogoo!]  "The burst of howling laughter would just practically knock me out of my bed 
one flight above, but at least I had the satisfaction of knowing that no real shades would come to 
get me in the midst of such strong adult mockery and racket.  Gad that was a gang.  They called 
themselves "la moudie gang", until one of the couples died leaving them twelve couples instead 
of thirteen.  So it became the "Dirty Dozen".  Poor priest, la poule du prie."  So forth and so on.  
"Quebec, Darnais."  And you got french in disperse everywhere.  Over here.  
D:  Now who, who is this speaking?  
R:  This is Jack speaking about when he, he had the, they had these parties.  
D:  So this was one of the family houses?
R:  Yup.  And when they had the, the, the Saturday night parties.  See in those days the french 
people would not go out.  And this was in the thirties.  So what happened in the thirties?  Up 
until 1933 for a long period of time of years we, we uh, we had the prohibition.  Okay.  So they 
had to have their parties in the house.  And someone always showed up with moonshine, you 
know?  And uh, there is still some people in their sixties over here who remember these parties.  
And I found some who talked to me about these, these wild Saturday night parties.  And they call
themselves uh, wait a minute, uh, the, "The Jolly Fourteen".  [Laughs]  He doesn't call them that 
in here.  But "The Jolly fourteen".  And she described.  She told me who was in there, who the 
couples were and where they lived and everything.  And I'm able to reconstruct all of this.  [Loud
noise, sound of car passing by]  I haven't done it yet, but I've done it in, in one conference that I 
gave at LaVal, at the University up there in October.  And uh, she told me that all of these people 
would get up on Sunday morning and would all be lined up in church at 11:30.  Go to the 11:30 
Mass.  That was a big Mass.  They didn't want to go to 10:00 Mass, because that was the High 
Mass.  11:30 Mass was the last Mass.  Okay.  And it wasn't too long.  Everybody went to church. 
Gerald Nicosia in his book says that the old man never went to church, didn't go to church.  He 
may have gotten into an argument with the pastor, that again is the anti-clerical.  Where you, you 
mouth off at the pastor, but then you go to church.  You argue with the, with the men of the cloth,
but you go to church on Sundays.  [D:  Right, right]  As a matter of fact I found evidence in the 
Jubilee materials way back in 1929 when they were members of the parish, there's a whole list 
there of those who served on the, the Silver Jubilee Committee.  Leo Kerouac, Jack's father, and 
Gabrielle Kerouac, his mother served on two committees.  None church goers don't serve on 
committees of the Jubilee.  [D:  Yeah, really]  Does that fill in with your Italian upbringing too?
D:  Oh sure, sure.  
R:  Sure.  Non church goer, you don't serve on committees like that.  [D:  Yeah]  You say, "the 
hell with that."  You know, and he did.  [D:  yea, yeah]  He served on it.  So he's saying these 
things about Lowell and about the Kerouacs that we don't like.  Because really, we don't like it 
because it's not true basically.
D:  Sure. Yeah.  So that those Saturday night parties were essentially the "reveille." 
R:  "Reveille"!  That's it "Reveille."  I came from (--)  My family had a, a different circle of 
friends.  They weren't with them.  You see, they, they were in another family.  The Favreau 
Family.  They went into a big house up on Lakeview Avenue and that's where they went.  They 
were electricians.  [Few word unclear] electricians and uh, uh, they had, they even had priests 
that would go to those parties.  Uh, and they, they were envied.  A lot of people tried to come into
their group because they were a fun group.  She mentions some of the fun in it.  Of course you've
got to remember that Jack wrote this the, the uh,  "Dr. Sax", he was under the influence when he 
wrote that.  [D:  Yeah]  You know, he was, he either high on pot, or he had taken some pills, or 
something.  [D:  Yeah]  Ginsburg points that out.  Yet John Clellan Holmes says that you know, 
"no, it was really a well worked out novel and it was, it was polished and everything."  You 
know, but in a different style, [D:  yeah] you know?  So who are you going to believe?  You've 
got to believe what he wrote.  And what you can take out of it without trying to change it.  And I 
see in this over here a very good reflection of the popular side of our culture, our 
Franco-American culture.  Done in english, read by millions of people out there.  If he had 
written in french he wouldn't have been published.  You know?
D:  Yeah.
R:  They said up there at the international gathering in Quebec that uh, "oh, if he had written in 
french he would have been great over here in Quebec."  And all of that.  Nonsense.  Nope.  Nope.
Jack wrote about Lowell the way he was and the way it was outside to the world and they read 
him.  Yeah.  
D:  Great.  I just want to (--)  [tape shuts off momentarily]  Back to business.
R:  See, the identity of the, the french people was very strong for them, the french side, by the 
type of saints that they, they took as their models, or as their patron saints for their parishes.  St. 
Louis de France.  You know, the saint King.  The only King who was a saint among all of the 
kings of France.  Nobility.  You know, Crusader.  And then when St. Jeanne D'Arc was founded a
few years later in the 20's, 1923, again the identity, the french identity is to strong it's, it's 
undeniable.  I mean years from now you're going to say St. Jeanne D'Arc.  Saint Joan of Arc.  
You know, we fought against the British.  [Chuckles]  It's, it's incredible.  Uh, uh, it's strong.  It's 
right there.  Just, just by the choice.  You know, like the Irish like to call their, all of their 
churches St. Patrick.  You know, and the Italians have, have the saints too.  Saint Anthony, or 
Saint Francis (--)
D:  I, like I went to, I went to Saint Catherine of [Siena?] growing up.  [R:  Yeah]  Yeah. 
R:  You know.  The great doctor, it was a church.  So.  [Pause]  And they are, they're sort of 
heroes.  And uh, when Jack (--)  Oh, this over here in the summer is great.  Well not in the 
summer.  About, about in May.  April or May when, when the river is bulging you know, with 
water.  [D: Yeah]  And it's almost like a flood.  See all of the (--)
D:  Does, does this, does the bend in the river, does this have any name?
R:  This is it.  This is it.  [D:  What do they call]  This is the elbow.
D:  They call it the elbow?
R:  Yeah, it's the el (--)  Well Jack calls it the elbow.  It's like the elbow turning over here.  See in 
this neighborhood how low it is.  [D:  Yeah]  How low?  That is that chapter, book 3, or book, or 
is it book 4?  I'm not (--)  I don't remember.  "Dr. Sax".  That is it right there.  That's the 
Rosemont.  All of that. 
D:  All this is Rosemont.
R:  This was a dump.  When he talks about the dump there, that we mentioned earlier, it's right, it
was right here underneath this here.  
D:  That's what he's talking about in the "Town and the (--)
R:  Can you imagine if someone starts talking about the toxic waste that is under here.  [D:  
Laughs]  They'd have to rip up the whole thing.  Well look what they're doing in South Lowell.  
[D:  Uh huh]  By the way, on that Billerica Street, [D:  yeah] that's right next to Maggie Cassidy's
house.  [D:  Huh]  She lives there.   She's still alive.  
D:  Is she really?
R:  Ooh yes.  Can't get close to her.  She's angry because of what he said in Maggie Cassidy.  
And her name is really Mary Carney, but she's, she's married a couple of times.  So that her name
is something else now, you know?  [D:  Huh]  Oh yeah.  [D:  Huh]  
D:  Do you know what her name is now?
R:  Her name now?  Gee, you know, I'm trying to remember.
D:  Because I met a women who lives on Billerica Street, who is uh, [R:  who is that?] her name 
is Mary Minorgan.  
R:  Minorgan?  Oh, Mary Minorgan, I talked to her yesterday.  She lives on Fresh, Fletcher 
Street.  She's the one that's angry at Cardinal Law.  
D:  Yeah, about the Saint Peter's.  
R:  Yup.  How old is she?
D:  I have no idea.
R:  Is she an older woman, or?
D:  Yeah, she is an older woman.  
R:  Older woman, yeah.  Okay.  Yeah, she's uh, she's Irish, right?  [Chuckles]  [D:  Yeah]  Oh, 
she's, she's a wonderful soul.  [D:  Yeah, yeah]  What a combated type boy.  [D:  Yeah, really.  
Really]
D:  Why, why was it that the Kerouac family moved, moved so much?
R:  Well, to me I think they did that because uh, the rent was cheap.  They didn't, there is no real 
answer to that.  Some people are trying to say that he was a step ahead of the Sheriff and he 
didn't pay his rent.  I don't believe that.  So whether I believe it or now doesn't matter.  You want 
to find out why.  The only thing I can say is that he wasn't the only one who did that.  Lot of 
other people did.  The rents were, were, were very very cheap.  All of this area here was filled 
with cottages and duplexes and everything.
D:  This was all the area that got wet down in the flood?
R:  Yeah, well further down.  You know, lower.  
D:  Oh.  Now we're turning on to Bodwell are we?
R:  Yup.  Bodwell.  Then we go to uh, this first one here.  
D:  Was Pawtucketville (--)  [R:  This is Pawtucket (--)]  I mean you hear, it seems like a lot of 
people moved to Centraville first and then to Pawtucketville.  Is that right?  
R:  Yeah.  That, that or (--)  Yes.  Yes.  Uh, Pawtucketville had regions that were not developed 
yet.  You know, and you could buy into the woods and you know, it was still countryside, you 
know?  And that uh, it was probably a better neighborhood you know.  [Ruffling of paper]  
     They lived over here on this street.  On Ger...  Gershom.  Gosh, I don't remember the name of 
the street.  I'm drawing a blank.  When he was at the Bartlett Junior High School they lived in 
this house over here.  Yeah.  Sixteen.  [D:  The number is sixteen?]  I think it's sixteen, yeah.  
And then they moved just around the corner.  I mean if they hadn't paid their rent it would have 
been noticed, you know?
D:  Yeah, sure.  
R:  And they, they could have gone uh, gone after them.  This is Sarah.  They lived on Sarah 
Avenue.  Uh, this one right here.  Thirty-five.  
D:  This one, the grey one, huh.
R:  The grey one, yeah.  And then when he was in high school, in college, they lived in, well just 
around the corner on this one too.  
D:  Now the father died when he was in(--)  Was it after (--)
R:  When they were in New York.
D:  When they were in New York.  Okay.
R:  After they moved out, yeah.  I don't know which one they lived in, but in this triple at 
seventy-four Gershom.  This is Gershom.  
D:  Gershom, okay.
R:  And then of course they lived on uh, on the fourth floor of, of that one right there.  
D:  Near Astro Subs.  
R:  Yeah, Astro Subs.
D:  Yeah.  That was while he was in high school?
R:  Yeah, senior in high school.  [D:  Oh]  Yeah, that's Maggie Cassidy, 1938, 39.  That was a 
nice one.  That was a good book.  It is, yeah.  Of course Mary wouldn't say so.  Mary Carney was
her name.  We know that much, but she's never, she had never spoken to anybody.  Even Spike 
tried.  [D:  wouldn't talk]  No, she wouldn't even answer.  [D:  Wow]  The mother came over and 
answered and said, "no, she won't speak to anybody."  [D:  Huh]
D:  Well there's always a mixed feeling about an author that that, that writes from his own (--)  
My wife is from Ashville, North Carolina you know, and Thomas Wolf you know is the big thing
there. And you know, there's that same mix.  Some people you now, are real real proud of him, 
some people are still mad at some of things that he said about, about Ashville.  
R:  Well the, the uh, the town, "The Town and the City" is written modeled on him, on his type 
of, his style.  I knew (--)  There's a chapter in "The Town and the City" where he talks about rain.
And after you finish reading it you feel wet.  [Laughs]  You know, very good.  [D:  Yeah]  See 
you can't stay indifferent to Jack.  You read him and you dislike him, or you read him and you 
like him.  I happen to be of the later.  
D:  Did your paths ever, ever cross with his?
R:  Yes.  Only once, but it was uh, it was so brief it's insignificant.  It was at the high school.  He 
did come to Lowell High you know, to uh, to give a little talk.  Because one, one substitute 
teacher brought him in after a night of drinking.  [Chuckles]  And he gave a talk to a ninth grade 
english class on Moby Dick.  And he stayed a few, few hours.  But that was the only time.  This 
is the Martin house.  [D:  Oh!]  Right here.  Imposing.
D:  Boy, what a magnificent house!  [R:  Yeah]  And uh, now what street is this?  This is the one 
that goes by the hospital.
R:  This is uh, uh, wait a minute.  [D:  This is 187]
D:  That is an imposing house.
R:  Oh yeah.  And there's uh, there's a nice garage.  See in the back, a barn [D:  Yeah] and 
everything.  
D:  Now were they renting this house?
R:  Well, they never actually lived in it.  It's the mythical house of the Martin.  [D:  Oh!]  When 
he lived in that fourth decker he was fantasizing about living in this one.  [D:  I'll be darn]  You 
see?  [D:  Oh, okay]  It's in here somewhere.  Moody Street.  And another "Book of Dreams".  
Moody Street, Salem.  That's a sex dream, we go around that.  And then Gershom.  Saint Jeanne 
D'Arc's church where he found the word "beat".  Beatific Generation.  [D:  Uh huh]  It was taken 
from when he was at uh, Saint Jeanne D'Arc.
D:  But do you mean there was something in the church that said the Beatific Generation?
R:  To him he went in there and somebody must have, he must have thought about the word 
beatific.  Beat.  See to him he was interested in beat people.  People who were beat, down beat, 
you know?  "Start from the center of town on a sunny afternoon from Daley Square."  That's 
Kearney Square.  "And walk up River Street where all of the traffic is converged.  Past the bank 
the Galloway High School and the YMCA.  And move on up till private residence begin to 
appear.  Leaving the business district behind, the great factory walls are barely within reach the 
the left, and to the right of the business district.   Along the river there's a quiet street with a few 
sedate funeral homes."  That's (--)  "An orphanage, brick mansions of a sort, and the bridges that 
leave across to the suburbs where most of the people of Galloway live.  Cross the bridge known 
as the white bridge swooping right over the Merrimack River and pause for a moment to view 
the prospect.  City whiz, there is one more bridge.  The wide, smooth basin where the river turns.
And beyond that a far off flank of land thickly populated.  Look away from the city over the 
frothing falls and see into the misty reaches that include New Hampshire, an expanse of green 
placid land and calm water.  There are the railroad tracks running along the river on the other 
side.  A few water tanks and sitings, but the rest is all wooded.  The far side of the river presents 
a highway dotted with road houses and roadside, roadside stands and a return gate from up river. 
Up river reveals the suburbs thick with rooftops and trees.  Cross the bridge to these suburbs and 
turn up river."  So that's where we are, up, okay?  "Along the flank of populations, along the 
highway, and there is a narrow black tar road leading off inland."  This is the road he's talking 
abut.  [D:  Uh huh]  This is Old Galloway Road.  [Chuckles]  It's Varnum Road.  Okay.  "Just 
where is rises", over here, okay.  "Before dipping once more into pine forest and farmlands, lies a
concentration of houses sedately spaces off from one another."  That's behind us.  "A residents of 
ivy stone, house of a judge, a white washed old house with round wooden pillars on the porch."  
This is a dairy farm.  It's back there, the, the wide (--)  Wait a minute.  "There are cows in the 
fields that run rambling.  Victorian house with a battered grey look.  A high hedral all around.  
Trees huge and leafy that almost obscure the front of the house.  A hammock on the old porch 
and a disheveled back yard with a garage, and a barn, and an old wooden swing.  This last house 
is the home of the Martin family." 
    They say that it, this is the one.  You know, we'd have to get out and you know, look through 
the uh, uh, (--)  Because the house with the wooden pillars are a little bit (--)  We'll turn around.  
It's before this one.  But this is, this is generally the one that they, [D:  Uh huh] they think he had 
in mind when he wrote that paragraph, that description.  [Pause]  There were trees.  You know it 
changes as the years go along.  [D:  Sure, sure]  The pillar is probably of there, that one.  [D:  Uh 
huh, uh huh]  [Sound of cars passing by]  The white pillars.  I think it has to be that one. 
D:  Right.  Yeah, boy those are beautiful [unclear].
R:  See and some, some of these houses didn't exist in those days.  That one did.  Fewer homes.  
D:  Yeah, you can tell from the different architectural styles.  I guess if you really knew your 
architectural styles you can tell what period each house was. 
R:  Hm.  
D:  Yeah, there's some beautiful houses here.  When was it that uh, that you discovered Kerouac?
I mean you started reading his novels.  
R:  Um, about ten, fifteen years ago.  I, I started with "Dharma Bums".  No, "Subterraneans".  
"Subterraneans".  And I don't know, it just didn't turn me on at that time.  But then someone said, 
why don't you read "Visions of Gerard".  You'll recognize your parish and your neighborhood in 
that.  And I did!  And you know, uh, it struck me how he could write such beautiful things about 
you know, our parish and our, our neighborhood.  The guy was really into it.  [pause]  I don't 
think that I could follow with such devotion his commitment to writing.  No, I'm pretty much 
settled into a neighborhood person.  I'm a teacher.  Teach French and Latin.  And I don't have 
very uh, heroic ideas about going out there and giving a big message to the world really.  [Sound 
of clock ticking]  I'm not the type.  But I like, I like what he, he writes.  The way he writes.  
Some of his style and everything.  You know he's, he has reached uh, certain levels.  And this 
over here is the stations of the cross that he talks about in, in "Dr. Sax".  
D:  Yeah.  This really has to be one of the most impressive sights in Lowell.
R:  I come over here um, oh at least once a week.  When I walk and (--)  Even in the wintertime 
I'll come down.
D:  Uh huh.  What, now what is the story behind these.  When were these, when were they (--)
R:  1911.  And it was uh, it was built to commemorate Our Lady of Lourdes in southern France.  
You know, the apparition of uh, of our Lady to uh, Bernadette [Souberou?] in uh, uh, in 18, I 
don't know, the 18 something.  I don't remember.  1850's, 60's
D:  Was this built by a parish group, or was it built by the school, or?
R:  Yeah.  Not this school.  This was an orphanage.  It's called the Franco American School now, 
but this was an orphanage.  And the, the orphans lived here.  You know?  I want to show you 
something here.  [Looking for something in a book]  "The Grotto, it's beauty" (--)
side one ends
side two begins.
SIDE TWO BEGINS WITH ROGER IN MID-SENTENCE:
R:  "To the orphanage on the corner of Pawtucket Street and School Street at the head of the 
white bridge.  A big Grotto is their back yard.  Mad, vast, religious.  The twelve stations of the 
cross.  Little individual twelve altars set in.  You go in front, kneel.  Everything but incense in the
air.  The roar of the river.  Mysteries of nature.  Fire flies in the night flickering to the waxy stare 
of statues.  I knew Dr. Sax was there flowing in the back docks of this wild and [hinkty cape?]  
Culminating was the gigantic pyramid of steps upon, upon which the cross itself poked 
phallically up with its poor burden of the son of man all screwed across it in his agony and fright.
Undoubtedly this statue moved in the night after the last of the worshipers is gone.  Poor dog."  
[Laughs]  
     Come here, I want to show you something over here.  We'll go our just, just one second.  [D:  
Okay]  Okay, and then (--)  [Sound of car doors closing]
D:  So this, so this is the white bridge?
R:  That one.  See, it's white.  
D:  Right.  Was that his own name for it, or was that a name that it was know, that it's known by? 
R:  When I was a kid you say the white bridge.
D:  That's the white bridge.
R:  Yeah.  And that's a suicide bridge.
D:  Suicide bridge?  Oh.
R:  Yeah, it's very high.  Some people committed suicide there.  
D:  Really, okay.
R:  Oh yeah!  They go out and they gamble their money at the Lafayette Club, lose everything 
they had, then [makes sound].  [D:  Oh]  We know at least one or two that did that.  
D:  Oh.  So it's the suicide bridge and then the Aiken Street Bridge.  
R:  Yeah.  I call the Aiken Street Bridge my grandmother's bridge, because that was close to my 
grandmother's house, okay.  And then there was the uh, the Bridge Street Bridge.  And that was 
it, [D:  Uh huh] because we didn't have the other one, okay.  [D:  Uh huh]  I just want to show 
you something on the other side, okay?  This over here has some uh, somethings about it that, 
that was reminiscent of St. Joseph's oratory in Montreal.  Have you ever been up there?  
D:  Yes, yeah.
R:  Have you gone up on your knees?  
D:  No, I haven't gone on my knees.  
R:  Okay, but you know that that was one of the (--)
D:  Yes, yeah.
R:  Okay.  Over here, we can't go up it now, but there's a stairway that I want you to see.  See?  
The snow is on it now.  All right, but you see those things?  They're much too low to be, they, 
they're this low.  No, you need something high like this.  And the steps, I'll bring you back one of
these days.  And the steps are only this tall.  
D:  About three or four inches?
R:  Yeah.  And it's really not a step that you would use to walk on.  So you went up there.  There 
were twenty-eight steps okay.  And you went up those steps on your knees.  And you were helped
to go up by grabbing on to either one of those two uh, guard rails [D:  speaks too softly, cannot 
transcribe.] that you went up like this.  You said one prayer then you went up one with your knee.
And I did it one night, not praying, but I said to myself, "I wonder if it can be done."  I came 
over here, I got on my knees and I took the thing and I went up on my knees.  You know, each 
one and stopped for a second.  And I said, "yeah, people were doing this."  And I checked with 
my mother and she said, "of course, that's the way it was done."  When you went up there when 
you reached heaven where the cross is and you said your prayer.  And then you went down and 
you're all set.  [Laughs]  [D:  Um]  Huh?  You know where I want to go?  I want to go to Italy 
where they have that vile of blood of Saint Januarius.  [D:  Yes, yes, yes.]  The whole crowd goes
wild!  They had it on TV once.
D:  I saw that.  I saw that.
R:  Did you see that thing?  [D:  Yes, yeah]  Didn't it make you shiver?   [D:  Yeah, really]  My 
gosh!  [D:  Really]  Especially you, you're Italian!  [D:  Yeah, yeah]  Oooh!
D:  Now when he says the twelve little altars?
R:  Yeah, they're really fourteen.  I guess he got mixed up.
D:  So he meant?  [R:  He meant this]  He meant this. 
R:  Yup, all of these.  
D:  Are these statues, are they wooden, or are they plaster, or (--)
R:  No, they're, they're plaster.  They were made in the (--)  There was a mold that was made and 
then they just (--)  Not plaster.  I guess it's plaster, yeah.  They were, they were done by a 
frenchman and I don't even know the name.  The nuns probably would know it.  And at first they 
didn't have the little boxes.  That was put on later to protect them.  [D:  Oh, okay]  But still the 
vandals have, have reached a couple of them where something is broken, you know?  [D:  Yeah]  
Yeah you see, I'll show you one of them I think.  It's not too far so we can go over and look at it.  
Yeah.  See, this one.  [D: Oh yeah] The guy that's suppose to be nailing the uh, uh, that big nail, 
[D:  his hammer is {rest of comment unclear}] yeah, his, his, his arm was like this and somebody
you know, some guy must have come over here after taking a shot too many and threw (--)  No, 
you can't do that to Jesus.  You know.  [Chuckles]  [D:  Umhm]  This over here used to attract 
thousands.  Especially around Corpus Christi and around Easter, like Thursday, Holy Thursday.  
They had special ceremonies over here and this yard wasn't there.  I mean they didn't have this 
fence.  You can imagine how many people you can fit over here.  [D:  Yeah]  Okay.  And they'd 
have the ceremony over there.  They still have pictures of, of those days.  [D:  Hm]  And now 
people come over here, but it's a more privatized type of devotion.  But in those days, you know, 
oh big ceremonies and uh, uh, processions and everything.  And the priest got up on the pulpit.  
That's a pulpit right there.  [D:  Uh huh]  And he'd, he'd tell us we'd all go to hell if we don't keep
doing it.  [Laughs]
D:  Well then uh, so they'd, they no longer say mass here?
R:  They say mass.  We have one french mass over here every uh, uh, every year.  But the nuns 
have some.  Every once in awhile there will be.  Small groups will come.  And individuals come 
over here to pray.  I know I do.  Come here, I'll show you what it says down there.  It's uh, you 
ask a question, who did it?  Well it was the people of Lowell.  See, they wrote it up in french.  "In
the year of the Lord, 19 (--)"  [D:  "In the year of"]  Go ahead.
D:   In the year of the Lord 1911.  Thanks to the generosity of the parishioners of St. Joseph's , 
under the direction of the Reverend."  Actually what does RR {unclear}?
R:  Uh, the Reverend Fathers.  Oblates.
D:  "Oblates of Mary Immaculate, this Grotto was raised in the, to the honor, or in the honor of 
our Lady of Lourdes, protector of the Franco American Orphanage."  [R:  That's it]  "Orphans."  
R:  Yeah.  In 1986 uh, Alan Ginsburg and Gregory Corso came here for the first in a series of 
poetry reading that we've had since then.  And uh, Ginsburg, and Corso, and I, and many many 
others, say well, probably a group of I'd say fifteen.  We'd come over here and we're walking, 
you know.  And Ginsburg told us this story.  That he brought uh, uh, the singer there that was 
mentioned?  [D:  Uh, Dillon]  Dillon.  Bob Dillon, yeah.  He brought Bob Dillon over here once 
to Lowell to show him the Kerouac places, because Dillon was the one who said that Jack wrote 
in American.  He didn't write in english, he wrote in American.  He brought him over here and 
they each lit a candle, okay.  And Dillon lit his candle and then he was walking away with it.  So 
Ginsburg say, "hey, wait a minute now."  He says, "you leave it there."  He says, "why?"  He 
said, "I paid for it, why can't I keep it and walk away with it?"  He says, "no, that's not the way it 
works.  You light it and you leave it there to, to uh, to pray for you over here."  [Both Laugh]
D:  Paul brought, had brought um, in some magazine he found a photograph.  I guess it must 
have been from that visit.  And it's a picture of Dillon standing underneath the cross.  Have you 
seen that?
R:  No, I haven't seen it.  No I hadn't seen that.
D:  Okay, let's go, let's go to the office after this [R:  okay] and there's a zerox, there's a zerox of 
it.  
R:  Yeah.  I, I'd like to uh, I'd like to probably end it over here, you know?  [D:  Okay]  And uh, 
because I think if we go to the cemetery uh, it's way over and uh, I don't know if it's (--)  
Although I can tell you one time I went to the cemetery under these conditions, because the 
reporter insisted.  I said, "but we won't see it."  When we got there I said, "they just buried 
someone close to his grave."  It wasn't that.  Somebody had gone there and shoveled all the snow
away.  Let's go and see.  Let's go and check.  This is too much for me.  I want to see if they took 
the snow away from Jack's grave.  
D:  Wow.
R:  Do you want to?
D:  Yeah, I'd love to.
R:  Do you mind?
D:  No, I'd love to.
R:  Okay.
D:  I'd love to.
R:  Oh, and you know, it was Susan Trout, she's a reporter for the Globe.  And she says, "please 
take me."  I says, "why?"  I says, "you know, it's going to be all full of snow."  It was after a 
snow storm like this.  It was last February, a year ago.  [D:  Uh huh]
She says, "well, she says, I really would like to see where he's buried."  I said, "but it's going to 
be covered with snow."  Well we got there and then I said, "well wait a minute now.  This sounds 
too fishy to me."   I says, "let's stop at the house, I says, and I'm going to find out, get to the 
bottom of this."  So I saw uh, O'Keefe.  He's the guy, the grave digger over there.  I said, "what's 
the story?"  I says uh, "you showing partiality towards Jack."  She says, "no."  He says, "no, it's 
not me.  I didn't do that."  He says, "somebody else came in.  We don't know who."  "They came 
in and they just took the snow away.  [D:  Oh, wow]  I mean you, you got to like Jack to do that. 
D:  Yeah, really.
R:  You know?  [D:  Really]  Let's go over and check it.  Hell, and then we'll go to the office, all 
right?
D:  Okay, great.  Great.  It must have been a terrible time when they, when they tore down "Little
Canada."  
R:  Well it was terrible in one way, but in another you know, occupancy was going down.  There 
were a lot of empty buildings there.  They weren't, they weren't being lived in.  They weren't 
occupied, you know?  People weren't living there so it was dangerous for fire.  [D:  Uh huh]  
This is what I was told.  Uh, I think they could have handled it differently.  They could have 
taken the ones that were uh, empty and revitalized them.  And, but again, you know, those, those 
who wanted to move our to "Little Canada" where did they want to move?  Where do you think 
they want to move?  If you live in a place like that over there on the second floor, and you've got 
the means to move out of a place like that, what kind of place you going to move in?  A little 
cottage [D:  yeah] that's detached and has a little yard.  Or you're going to move in Dracut, or 
Westford.  I, you know?  [D:  Yeah]  It's not easy to, to stay in a place like "Little Canada" for 
some people.  And uh, apparently for a lot of people, because they were moving out.  Now a lot 
of people were happy there, because they felt comfortable with that identity.  I know my, I 
couldn't get my mother to say anything against "Little Canada".  Not at all. I says, "Ma, weren't 
their cockroaches there and everything?"  Oh, she says, "no."  She says, "no, the people were 
clean.  They kept it clean."  No, nope.  She says, "it was just little, it was just Cana... Canadians 
that lived there."  And when she means Canadians, she means french speaking, you know.  To her
when she says, [says it in french] Canadien, she means those that speak french.  [Coughs]  And 
you know she isn't that old.  My mother is only seventy, seventy-two.  Seventy-two.  But there 
was that brief moment in a very important time in my life when we lived there.  And I can't 
remember anything before that.  And I have very specific things that I remember about "Little 
Canada" that, that you know, I verify with my mother.  And she says, "yup, yup."  But (--)
D:  For instance what?
R:  All right.  For instance I know we lived next to the canal and we played around there.  And it 
was dangerous.  I remember that we lived on the second floor on Cheever Street of a building 
diagonally across from which there was a little girl who was uh, who's retarded.  But she made 
sounds and I imitated her.  And my parents told me to stop that.  [Coughs]  She used to say 
something like [makes sounds: ader, ader, ader].  And I'd go into the window and I'd respond to 
her.  I'd say, ader, ader, ader.  You know.  And uh, my parents say, "no, don't, don't do that.  She 
says, she's sick."  Uh, [coughs] I remember when we moved away from "Little Canada" and 
moved into Centraville on the second floor of a building, a duplex.  And the first thing I said, I 
was a little boy of three or four years old, "ooh, we have a bathtub."  Some apartments over there
didn't have bathtubs, you know.  [Coughs]  I mean it was uh, if you stayed planted in "Little 
Canada" you weren't expanding your world.  Why was it called "Little Canada"?  Because 
everybody there were Canadians.  And everybody spoke french.  [Coughs]  And we lived on top 
of one of each other, uh, of each other.  Sure it was nice.  And people came out.  I remember me, 
uh, remember we'd get out, outside and we'd sit on the porches and, and we'd talk to each other.  
Everybody talked to each other.  They, everybody new everybody else.  You know, there was 
Turner's Cafe.  My father loved it.  Uh, he loved it!  Go to Turner's Cafe and everybody was 
there.  [Coughs]  It was the bar room.  
D:  Turner's?
R:  Turner's Cafe.  Yup.  Turner's Cafe.  It was on Aiken.  And uh, I don't remember it, but I 
remember about it, because the people talked about it.  Later on, you know, I remember my 
father uh, talking about living in "Little Canada".  You know, "do you remember that?"  I says, 
"no I don't."  But some of the things I did remember that I mentioned.  I remember there was 
only my brother and I.  And then when we moved on to Lakeview Avenue, uh, we were so happy
there.  There was a, there was a yard.  You know, there were trees.  There was space.  And there 
were little houses.  There weren't, it wasn't just blocks.  You know what I'm saying?  You know, 
you live close to New York.  You've been to Brooklyn.  [D:  Yeah, yeah]  Wouldn't you rather live
in Grenich?  [D:  Oh yeah!]  You know, in Connecticut and, and uh, you know, just like Dracut is
a nice place in which to live.  And so it Westford.  And even Centraville and Pawtucketville.  But
"Little Canada" you're hammed in.  I'm not saying anything against "Little Canada".  I'm just 
saying that, that not, not every Canadian wanted to live there.
D:  Yeah, that's perfectly understandable that people move on.  [R:  You know, don't forget (--)]  
Well, you know, so you can have your little plot of land and you could you know, like you were 
saying before, you could have a garden and (--)
R:  Where did we live?  We lived in wide open spaces on the banks and the valley of the St. 
Lawrence River and the [Vichelieu?].  And we lived on farms.  Lot of air, lot of space.  We came 
over here so we could earn some and then go back up to Canada and buy a piece of land.  Some 
did.  They went back.  Others, we stayed here.  Hey, we integrated.  Uh, what the hell, we make 
enough money.  And then uh, this isn't bad.  And well we'll move out eventually.  Buy an acre or 
two, or go up to New Hampshire.  You know?  [D:  Umhm]  It, it's the story of integration and 
uh, note that I avoid the word that starts with "a".  S S I M I L I L A right?  [D:  {Laughs} right]  
All right.  I don't even want to say that, because it's suppose to be a tabu word.  It's a no word.  A 
yes word is integrated.  You know, when you integrate with someone it's better than to be uh, 
swallowed up, you know?  [D:  right]
D:  Right.  You have your own identity, but you're [R:  yeah], yeah you're (--)  This is a beautiful 
cemetery.  This is the uh, this is the Lowell Cemetery?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is the uh, Edson, Edson Cemetery.  Do you know that these are all maple, 
maple trees?  And in September is a wonderful place to come in.  Uh, nice!. 
D:  Oh yeah, it's the color.
R:  Beautiful, uh!  Great!  [Long pause]
  
D:  [Few words unclear] that the, where Kerouac is buried is the Sampas family plot?
R:  Yup.  That's the Sampas family plot.  Yup.  It wasn't done.  [D:  Uh huh]  See?  I'm 
unpleasantly surprised.  [D:  Yeah]  Here it is.  See where that little clump of thing is right there? 
[D:  Right, right]  Right over there.  [D:  huh]  Yup, they haven't done it yet.  Somebody will 
come over and do it though.
D:  Yeah.  Yeah, I understand that there's quite often things left on the grave and (--)  [R:  Oh 
Yeah]  Yeah.
R:  We came here one day and uh, I came here and [Darin Foye?] said, "have you tasted it?"  I 
said, "yes.  I wanted to know if it was real, real stuff."  There was a bottle of gin with some gin in
it.  He says, "oh, you tasted that?"  I says, "yeah!"  Because I wanted to know.  I tasted it, it was 
real gin.  I know gin.  It was left empty.  Half empty, you know?  [D:  Uh huh]  There was just 
this much in it [D:  uh huh] and it wasn't water.  So.
D:  Someone had a drink and left some for Jack.
R:  Yeah [laughing] left some for Jack.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
D:  Let's go on back to what you were saying before about the, the, the Veillez.  So that there 
were, and when you say be a group of families that, that regularly got together?
R:  Les Veillez, yup.  [D:  Yeah]  This, Les Veillez, either they were relatives, or friends, okay?  
But they'd get together on Saturdays.  I know in my family uh, we would go and visit my 
grandparents on Sunday afternoon, or Sunday night.  I know because he'd give me a little glass, 
you know, those whiskey glasses there with a little handle?  They look like little, little tubs.  [D:  
Uh huh]  He'd give me one full one before we leave home [D:  uh huh] of wine so I would sleep 
well.  [D:  Right]  And we'd get together and we'd sing songs, because uh,  there was always 
someone in the family who new how to play the piano.  You know, une carnavale de venise.  
D:  What was that?
R:  Carnavale de venise.  [D:  Huh]  The carnival of Venice.  [D:  Uh]  That was one of our 
french songs.  [Unclear] Venice.  [Chuckles]  And then there was uh, uh, Evangeline.  Oh yes!  
[Sings:  Evangeline!  La, la, la dum, da da da dum!]  You know, and we all sing in on it.  Sing 
along, you know.  And then uh, uh, the grownups would talk and the children would listen.  Very 
European.  
D:  Yeah, yeah.  
R:  A table as you know uh, in a french home as well in an Italian home in Italy, uh, the 
grownups talk and the children listen, [D:  I see] because it's there opportunity to learn.  [D:  
That's right, yeah]  Oh boy!
D:  Yes, we used to have five, six course meals in our (--)  And my grandparents would go on for 
you know, three or four hours.  And uh, yeah (--)
R:  Wasn't that wonderful!
D:  [Unclear], then we sat there and listened to the grownups talk.  Yeah.  [R:  Yeah]  Yeah.  Of 
course we got a little bored every once in awhile.  We'd crawl down underneath the table  and sit 
underneath the table while the grownups talked.  
R:  Yup.  Gee, Priscilla mentioned that.  She mentioned crawling underneath the table with Jack 
and Nin when they had those parties at uh, on 66 West Street and at her house, the Dupre house.  
[D:  Uh huh]  You know why I'm doing this?  I like it.  It's not that I'm a real re... I'm not a 
research person you know.  You must have noticed that right away.  Uh, but I like doing it 
because it's so much part of my life.  And all these people are still around.  It's going to have to 
be done now [D:  yeah], otherwise they're all going to die off and we're going to be gone.  And 
all we'll have uh, those self proclaimed experts who are saying things about us that are not quite 
true.  [D:  Right]  [Loud sound of car passing by]
D:  Are you going to try and put together a book?
R:  Well, a book.  I suppose I could, you know, on, on his childhood.  That's what I'd like to do.  
On the Lowell years.  [D: Yeah]  Because there's a lot to be said about this background that we've
only touch on this morning.  Uh, you know uh, the Franco Americans are not like the Irish let's 
say, or the Italians.  We've never reached the panicle of political recognizability if you will.  You 
know, like we don't have a Mario Cuomo among our people.  Or the Greeks.  We don't have a, a 
Michael Dukakis, but we have some significant heroes, but not of that stature.  You know, or a 
John Kennedy like the uh, the Irish have, or a Tip O'Neil.  [D:  Uh huh]  You know?  Where 
we're uh, there was nothing very vociferous about us, never.  That's why I laughed when I, I 
heard Nicosia say up in Quebec that Jack Kerouac's father was vociferously anti-catholic.  Well 
god, we shut up at the end of his talk.  We said, "how can you say that about him?"  Well now 
that I think about it, how can you say that anything we ever did was vociferous.  You know, we, 
we weren't.  [D:  Yeah]  We live uh (--)  And uh, Jack is one who in his own way, by writing what
he did uh, has talked about us in a very significant way.  
D:  Do you think that that, could that be one reason why a lot of people locally have mixed 
feelings about him?
R:  Yeah, they probably don't like what he said about us.  But I, I find nothing wrong what he 
said about us.  Really.  He never said that, that much that was bad.  [D:  Yeah]  You know, there 
was, there was never never anything real bad.  Awful.  He didn't tear us apart.  He talked about us
with, with a considerable amount of uh, of uh, feeling, positive feeling.  [D:  Uh huh]  You know,
those things I read to you about the party and everything, you know, they're a bit funny, 
humorous, but he's, he spoke with nice words about us.  People all over the world are reading 
these things.  And I guess it's not dying out.  Whenever you think it's going to die out, something 
pops up.  [D:  Yeah]  There he is.  Again.  [D:  Uh huh]  I thought he was gone.  Thought he was 
gone and forgotten, but he isn't.  This thing in June, I hope you're going to be around for that talk.
D:  I, I hope so.  I'm hoping that I can come back up for it.  
R:  Why, when are you going to leave?
D:  Well I'm here till the end of May.  [R:  Yeah]  And then I'll go back down to North Carolina.  
Uh, (--)
R:  Oh well, don't come back if you're going there, because your, your wife will be waiting for 
you. 
D:  Well then I'll find a way to come back.
R:  Come back with her.
D:  Yes.  [R:  You know?]  Yeah.  
R:  After all his hero for "The Town and the City" as far as method is concerned is Lowell, right? 
D:  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah that's really clear with just in that opening passage.  [R:  Yes]  Yeah, and he
must have, he must have seen himself in that, in that relationship to Lowell, the way that the 
relationship they both had to, had to Ashville.
R:  You know what, I'm going to tell you right now.  I've never read in any book, but this was 
given to me by some drinking pals of mine who had the opportunity to run into him in the 
drinking holes.  I wasn't lucky, they were.  I'm a reader, they're not.  But they told me this that 
"oh yeah, when we saw him he wanted to speak french to us."  And I've heard this so many 
times.  That when he'd come to Lowell, I heard it a couple of weeks ago, when somebody told 
me a story about what Jack thought of being Bourgeois, you know?  And uh, this guy says, I 
asked him I said, "was he speaking french by the way?"  "Oh yeah, he says, he was in the 
Pawtucketville Social Club.  He was sitting at the table and all of his friends were there from 
Lowell.  And he was speaking french."  He loved to speak french.  [D:  Uh huh]  You know, I 
think that's uh, uh, a significant thing there. 
    Oh, where are we going?
D:  Uh, let's go straight ahead and then turn, turn left down uh, down Middle Street.
R:  Okay.  I have a natural tendency to take a right there and go back to, go back home to 
[unclear].  Yeah, we got to go.  All right, we got to go back and park. 
D:  Well I, let's see.  We should be able to park on the street today, right?  Because it's a holiday.  
[R:  Sure]  So we can just go down to the end of the street and you can park you know, anywhere
you find down towards the end of the street, because the Commission is right on the corner.
R:  Okay, good.  Which office are we going to?  Oh, Paul's office.
D:  Yeah, Paul's office.
R:  Oh he's working today?
D:  No.  [R:  no]  But that's the office that we're working out of.  [R:  Oh okay]  And I've got a 
key to the office.  So we can go in then.
R:  Okay, all right.  Good enough.  Hm.  Yes.  Probably over here.
end of tape.
