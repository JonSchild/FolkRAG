3.  Libraries
  
4. Museum 
-
 Are the traditional crafts still prac-
ticed?

 Are the processes documented so that
 
others can learn in absentia?
 
-
 Are the senior crafts workers teaching
 
others?
 
-
 Are there adequate sales facilities
 
(where desirable?)
 
-
 Are senior crafts workers being ade-
quately supported economically so
 
they can pursue their work?

 How many native speakers are there?

 Have their traditional narratives
 
been documented?

 Is there a bi-lingual program in our
 
schools and/or a method by which
 
people can learn informally?
 
-
 Are the people teaching our language
 
in the school themselves native
 
speakers?
 
-
 Are there books,  pamphlets,  etc.  pu-
blished in our language?
 
-
 Does the local public,or school,or
 
university library have sufficient
 
informational materials concerning
 
our culture and history?
 
-
 If public facilities are inadequate,
 
should our tribe undertake founding
 
its own library for tribal research
 
purposes?
 
-
 Is there a near-by museum that contains
 
displays concerning tribal history
 
and skills?
 
-
 Should the tribe consider founding its
 
own musuem facility?
 Do we have

-
 Do we have the relevant information on
 
where such training can be obtained?

 Are we encouraging our young people to
 
get training in these areas?

funding sources for various cultural
 
projects?

maintained? Are there any we wish to
 
revive?

11.  Cultural facilities
 
-
 Do we have the necessary facili-
ties for tribal use -
-
 a cultu-
ral center,  open space appro-
priate for tribal dances and
 
ceremonies,  buildings appro-
priate for any of the above
 
uses?
 
I would add to this only similar questions concerning tribal
 
music,  dance and traditional sports/games.  BLH

Cheyenne-Arapaho Tribe
 
Dear Mr. Sutton:
 
When I arrived home in Washington, I discovered I had mis-
placed your address.  Therefore I an sending this letter
 
through Joy Reed at the Oklahoma Indian Affairs Comm'
 on,
 
who will. I hope
 • forward it along to you.
 
I an enclosing for your approval and correction the notes
 
I made on your "checklist* for Native American cultural
 
retention and restoration prog r
e s
s.  As I told you at the
 
conferences I was very impres s
ed with your remarks and
 
would like to be able to ut i
lize th e
n incconferring with
 
other tribes.
 
I was writing awfully fast while you wore speaking
 • øè it
 
is possible I didn't include everything you said • and it's
 
even possible that I mad, up s o
me of the questions myself!
 
Therefore, if you are still willing for me to ut i
lize this
 
list of yours as a kind of *talking paper" with other
 
Native American group. • I would be very grateful if you
 
wputd edèt èt really thoroughly and make sure it is entirely
 
correct from your point of view.
 
I an enclosing a stamped self- a
ddressed government envelope
 
for jou to use when you return the check-list to me • and
 
also another copy of the list itself in case you would like
 
to have it for your own records.
 
It was a pleasure meeting you in Oklahoma City
 • and pleas.
 
accept my very beat wishes and o
limenta.
 
Cordially.
