Though seas now divide, and the mountains so wide, 
I'll never once forget you far away; 
But I 
treasure still the flower that you gave me one 
sweet hour, 
When we watched the lads and lasses dancing gay, 
You've longed for my coming, and I've wept bitter 
tears, 
Your Scotch lassie still is your own; 
She never will he false, for her heart she left with you 
Nol your lassit, blue-eyed lassie will be true. 
CHORUS: 
Oh, laddie, my laddie far away, 
Still would your darling die for you; 
She never will be false, ah, no! no matter what they 
say, 
No, your lassie, blue-eyed lassie will be true. 
Then, love, don't forget that I 
think of you yet, 
Mid Scotland's bonnie hills across the sea; 
And though far away I 
roam, all! I 
know there is a 
home 
That is waiting there, my own, for you and me; 
I'll come to you laddie, like the bird to its nest, 
For still I 
am praying for you; 
Of all this world so fair I 
am loving you the best, 
And your lassie, blue-eyed lassie will be true.

Send Me A 
Rose From My Angel 
Mother's Grave. 
Music for sale and Copyrighted by B. W . 
HITCHCOCK, 166 Nassau 
Street, N. Y. 
Sung by BILLY BIRCH, ESQ. 
I've been thinking to-day of the happy years ago, 
And the tears quickly gathered in my eyes; 
As I 
held within my hand a 
portrait and a 
flower, 
Tokens bound to me by many sacred ties. 
The picture is my mothers, and she sent it cross the 
sea, 
And a 
blessing to her wandering son she gave; 
And this little faded flower blossomed on the grassy 
mound, 
For they sent me a 
rose from mother's grave. 
CHORUS: 
When you kneel down in prayer near the spot where 
she's laid, 
Remember this favor that I 
crave; 
Oh! take from the holy ground a 
blossom from the 
mound, 
And send me a 
rose from mothers grave. 
I 
would give all this world if it were mine to give, 
If my mother could return to me again; 
I 
would strive then to repay her many acts of love, 
For my heart is calling, and it calls in vain. 
Never more to feel her kisses and her words of bright-
est cheer; 
When she bid me hope, be patient, true and brave, 
And I 
keep my little flower ever near where e'er I 
go, 
For it blossomed on my angel mother's grave.

THE TENDERNESS OF LOVING. 
Composed by II. P. DANES. 
Copyrighted 1880. by B. W. H ITCHCOCK 
166 Nassau Street, N. Y. Sung by M INNIE LEE. 
-:0:----' 
All the earth is filled with blessing, 
Which no sorrow can destroy, 
And for every day of trouble, 
There shall come a 
day of joy; 
There are moments full of silver, 
All the showers from Heaven which fall, 
And the tenderness of loving, 
Is the blessing of them all, 
Cuoitus: 
Though the clouds may hang above us, 
Somewhere sunlight lingers still; 
And the good of every moment, 
Shall surpass the moment's ill; 
Love and trust are yet immortal, 
Loving souls immortal, too; 
And the glory of a 
jewel, 
Sparkles in a 
drop of dew. 
Take the dew-drops as God gives them, 
Be they moments be they hours, 
So the stream of life which bears you, 
Shall flow on through banks of flowers; 
There are moments full of blessing, 
As the showers from Heaven which fall, 
But the tenderness of loving, 
IQ 
the blessedness of all.

Hitch dem horses to de chariot, 
Drive right through de golden gate, 
Tell de children to be ready, 
For de time am growing late; 
Moses will be dar to meet you, 
With his sword right in his hand; 
And he will command the army, 
Marching to the promised land. 
All your garments you must bring, 
Long white robe and ebrything; 
When we meet de Angel band, 
Dis song we'll sing. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, keep dem golden gates wide open, 
Keep dem golden gates wide open, - 
Keep dem golden gates wide open, 
So de children can come in. 
When you climb de golden ladders, 
You must keep a 
sharp lookout, 
For de devil and his children, 
Might be hid somewhere about; 
KEEP DEM GOLDEN GATES WIDE OPEN. 
CONTINUED: 
Take your op'ra glasses with you, 
And your razor, sword and shield; 
So you can see all de children, 
As dey're marching through the field. 
All your garments you must bring, 
Long white robe and ebrything; 
When we meet de Angel band, 
Dis song we'll sing. 
Sing de news around de country, 
Tell de children near and far, 
flat dey'd better be dar early, 
While de gates dey am ajar; 
For old Moses am conductor, 
On de train dats on dis route; 
So just hab your tickets ready, 
If you don't dey'll put you out. 
All your garments you must bring, 
Long white robe and ebrything; 
When we meet de Angel uand, 
Dis song we'll sing.

My darling is a 
cashier, 
In a 
fancy dry-goods place; 
She keeps the cash all straight and square, 
With such an air and grace. 
She makes the change with such a 
dash, 
And very stylish air, 
That when it's done she sings out " cash," 
There's music in the air! 
CHORUS: 
Oh she's sweet, and she is fair, 
Full of styles and bangs her hair; 
She wears pull-backs and bangles rare, 
Oh she's a 
ducksey darling. 
Oh, then on Summer nights, you know, 
When business hours are done; 
We take a 
walk or else we go, 
To Central Park for fun. 
There stroll around and take an ice, 
Then in some arbor nigh, 
She'll say to me it's very nice, 
But dear, don't muss my tie. (Chorus).

MY DARLING LADY CASHIER—CoNnxuED.

On Sunday when the weather's fair, 
She gets herself up so; 
Regardless of expense or Care, 
In style from top to toe. 
With silk and satin, plumes and bows, 
And spit-curls on her brow; 
She's everlasting sweet, you know, 
Don't you forget it now. (Chorus). 
To Coney Island then we go, 
To have a 
jolly swim; 
The fellows all, they eye her so, 
But she only " takes it in." 
And when some sprig makes up to her, 
With such an air and dash, 
She only says young man, see here, 
Now don't you be so fresh. 
(
Chorus). 
And now next Spring she's promised me, 
To be my darling bride; 
We've bought the furniture, you see, 
And a 
cradle, too, beside. 
For when we're married, I 
presume 
As others always do, 
It will get filled—well—very soon, 
With little cashiers, too.

Though silence and coldness have us parted forever, 
I 
have come to tell, with deep pain in my heart, 
For the sake of the past and the love you once bore me, 
Oh 'twere but right that we in friendship should part. 
Even now, while the wound you inflicted is aching, 
A 
voice in my heart pleads -in soft tones for you; 
Who wavered and faltered, were fickle and altered, 
Oh, why were you false, when you could have been true? 
CI
-
TORUS, 
Why were you false, why so unkind, 
How could you forget one who lived but for you? 
The vows that were spoken, by you have been broken, 
Farewell forever, why were you untrue? 
Long years may elapse, and my name be forgotten, 
Although you once feared was my love for you true, 
But my love you accepted, first craved, then neglected, 
Whate'er unto others, I 
was faithful to you. 
New pleasures may greet you, new faces may meet you, 
New loves for a 
time your heart may entwine; 
Their friendship though newer, can never be truer, 
Or ever as tender or faithful as mine. (Chorus

PITY THE POOR.

Published by permission. 
Pity the poor this cold winter night, 
Keen blows the wind with merciless might, 
Fast falls the snow, oh, turn not away! 
Hunger and want on every hand stray; 
Give of a 
portion Heaven has sent, 
Ye who are blessed with wealth and content, 
Ye who have homes so cheerful and bright, 
Pity the poor this cold winter night. 
CHORUS: 
Turn not away, give, give of your store, 
Some weary heart make happy once more; 
Hari. to their cry, their pleading don't slight, 
Pity the poor this cold winter night. 
Cheerfully give and God will return, 
Thy brother's call, oh never more spurn, 
Always with us the poor still abide, 
Pass them not by, and turn not aside; 
Shivering forms with no where to go, 
Wearily plod, or crouch in the snow; 
Spare what you can, if only a 
mite, 
Pity the poor this cold winter night. (Churns). 
Do what you can, while journeying here, 
Some weary soul we always may cheer, 
Lighten the load of poverty's curse, 
All can spare some, though meagre their purse; 
Blessings and joys your days will pursue, 
Many are poor, the wealthy are few; 
All could be helped. if all give their mite, 
Pity the poor this cold winter night.

On Scotland's fair hills, or the mountains and rills, 
I've wandered there many a 
happy day; 
In looking at the lads and the lasses on the green, 
'Neath the fine old hills of Scotland far away. 
I've looked for her corning, but she's not come as yet. 
The truth seems to dawn on me plain; 
They say she is false but I'll still believe her mine, 
She's my darling blue-eyed Scotch lassie Jean. 
0 Jean, my dearest Jean ! 
Come to your laddie once again; 
They say you are false, but I'll still believe you mine, 
You're my darling blue-eyed Scotch lassie Jean. 
She said she soon would meet me, but I've waited long in 
vain, 
In lands far away she doth roam; 
Her promise she will keep, 0 ! break it not, my Jean, 
We'll be happy in our bonnie little home. 
Then let me not long wait, let me meet you soon, my Jean, 
And Heav'n will then smile on our love; 
And when life is ended, we'll leave this earthly scene, 
When our hearts will dwell in joy and bliss above.

Den we all would eat our supper, after dat we'd clear de

Dat's de only time we had to spare, to liab a 
little fun; 
Uncle Gabe would take de fiddle down, dat hung upon de

While de silvery moon was shining clear and bright; 
How de old folks would enjoy it, dey would sit all night 
and listen, 
As we sang in de ebening by the moonlight.

As we sang in de ebening by de moonlight. 
In de ebening by de moonlight, when de watch-dog would

In de corner near de fire-place, beside de old arm-chair; 
Whar Aunt Chloe used to sit and tell de piccaninnies sto-

And de cabin would be filled wid merry coons from near

All dem happy times we used to hab, will ne'er return

Eb'rything was then so merry, gay and bright; 
And I 
neber will forget it, when our daily toil was ober, 
How we sang in de ebening by de moonlight.

There's A 
Dear One Waiting For Me.

Sung by 
M ISS KITTY COLEMAN. 
I'm far away from the home I 
love, 
And my heart is sad and forlorn; 
I 
often think of my boyhood hours, 
Also the place where I 
was born. 
But Nellie my darling awaits my return, 
Her sweet face I'm longing to see; 
There's a 
sighing in my heart which keeps 
whispering, 
There's a 
dear one waiting for me. 
CHORUS: 
I'll soon return to my home again, 
How happy then I 
will he; 
When I'm welcomed back by my Nellie, 
For my darling is waiting for me. 
I've traveled across the ocean wide, 
And in strange countries have I 
been; 
I've been among people of all kinds, 
But no place like home have I 
seen. 
I'm longing to be back with my little dear, 
To my home across the wide sea; 
Oh, I'm weary and sad since we parted, 
There's a 
dear one waiting for me. 
While thinking about my childhood's days, 
When I 
used to play on the green; 
how oft I've roamed with my Nellie dear, 
I 
love to recall those bright scenes. 
Remembered and cherished are those childish 
hours, 
A 
wander no longer I'll be; 
For my darling is waiting and watching, 
There's a 
dear one waiting for me.

I'll take you home again, Kathleen, 
Across the ocean wild and wide; 
To where your heart has ever been, 
Since first you were my bonny bride; 
The roses all have left your cheek, 
I've watched them fade away and die; 
Your voice is sad when e'er you speak, 
And tears bedim your loving eyes. 
CHORUS: 
Oh, I 
will take you back, Kathleen, 
To where your heart will feel no pain; 
And when the fields are fresh and green, 
I'll take you to your home again. 
I 
know you love me, Kathleen, dear, 
Your heart was ever fond and true; 
I 
always feel when you are near, 
That life holds nothing dear but you. 
The smiles that once you gave to me, 
I 
scarcely ever see them now; 
Tho' many, many times I 
uee 
A dark'ning sh

ON YOUR KNEE.—COncluded.

DANCE ME ON YOUR KNEE. 
Sung with great success by Miss Minnie Leg 
When I 
was very young how fond I 
was of childisl% joys; 
I 
loved to play among the girls, but better with the boys; 
It was pussy in the corner, tag and ineminie, 
And when my ma put me in bed I 
would steel out on the 
sly. 
I 
dared not make the slightest noise when getting back in 
bed, 
The biggest boy would boost me in my window overhead; 
I 
would go to sleep and dream I 
was a 
lady young and 
gay, 
And when my ma would take me up to her I 
used to say; 
CHORUS— 
Dance me on your knee, mother, dance me on your knee; 
Clasp your arms around my waist, it wont hurt me. 
Hold me tight, don't let me fall, I 
won't be afraid at alt. 
Dance me, mother, dance me on your knee. 
ut when I 
wore long dresses first the little boys I 
shook, 
As my ideas developed the bigger ones I 
took. 
Instead of childish games it was parties, social balls and 
drives, 
Where'er I 
went I 
had my favorite escort by my side. 
But when I 
tire of one young man, another soon I 
take, 
For there's a 
way of knowing how to give the boys 'a 
quiet 
shake. 
And when I 
wish to call one back a 
smile would win the 
day— 
I 
need but look upon his face and coaxingly this say: 
Dance me on your knee, &c. 
I 
want to find a 
lover that will undertake the task, 
And understand just what I 
want, and never have to ask. 
If such can recommend himself I 
pray don't backward be, 
But be sure you're brave and strong enough to dance me 
on your knee. 
There's many a 
wish a 
young girl has she don't like to/ 
express, 
There's many a 
time we answer no, and heartily mean 
yes. 
I 
always warn the fellows when we are sitting all alone, 
sure don't rumple up my clothes, when you dance me 
on your knee. 
Dance me on your knee, &c.

Empty Is The Stable, Davy's Gone. 
Written by BEN COLLINS. COPYRIGHTED, 1881, by A, J. 
FISHER 
Sung with great success by LESTER 8...7 W ILLIAMS. 
I 
used to own a 
donkey, a 
bob-tail stubborn mule, 
He was born about the year of ' 49; 
His head was full of scars from stopping Railroad cars, 
He was ring-boned, spavined, deaf and blind; 
He could kick a 
steam engine, and raise you through 
the roof, 
And send you where Bob Ingersoll belongs; 
lie died at half past four, he's gone to that beautifu' 
shore, 
Empty is the stable, Davy's gone. 
CHORUS: 
Gone to join the angels with spit-curls on his hair, 
Died with epizootic in the head; 
He might have gone to Congress if he only lived, 
Empty is the stable, Davy's gone. 
His hoof was like a 
slungshot, he could raise you 
through the roof, 
he'd come into the house and kick you out of bed; 
His feet was full of bunions, he could eat a 
barrel of 
onions, 
And go to sleep a 
standing on his head; 
He'd go to a 
saloon, shove his hoof through a 
spittoon 
And kick the bar into the gutter for a 
joke, 
When he laid down and di -A, every mule in Jersey died 
Empty is the stable, Davy's gone. 
CHORUS: 
Davy's left the stable for the promised land, 
His overshoes and saddle are in pawn; 
No more hay he'll ever chew, they've turned him into 
glue, 
Empty is the stable Davy's gone.

Words and Music by Dorms. 
Music published and copyright 1879, by E. H. Harding, 229 Bowery, and 
sent to any address, poc-paid, on receipt of 35 cents. 
Sung by J. E. Munprry, of M URPHY & M ACK, for seventy-five consecutive 
nights at the London Theatre, N. Y., in their great sketch, 
" 
The Christening." 
Our club is always noted for its larking and sparkin' 
Such dancin' and singin' and jolly sport have we; 
Our picnics bate them all without denial, a 
trial 
Would set you wild with pleasure at the Twilight Coterie. 
It's dance and prance, and catch the motion easy, 
And in a 
whirl, swing your girl, now we're off in style 
you see. 
And still the fiddle and the horns are soundin' while 
boundin' 
• Are all the merry spielers of the Twilight Coterie. 
CHORUS. 
Then it's on a 
summer's night in the park, my boys, 
Where the merry girls are singin' light and free, 
hands around and round, and round, oh! what a 
lark, my 
boys, 
flow the spielers prance, at the moonlight dance, of the 
Twilight Coterie. 
There's honored delegations from the " Starlights" and 
"Skylights," 
The " Ours" and " Yours" and other coteries, 
Togethe'r with their friends and their ladies, the daisies, 
Invited guest whose hearts are blessed with all the beer 
they please; 
It's skip and dip, and sachez round in glory, 
Oh, Kate asthore I 
bang the floor, that's the style of girl 
for me, 
And so around we balance, and each daisy is crazy 
Wid great hilarity, all at the Twilight Coterie. 
(Chorus.)

OH! FRED, TELL THEM TO STOP. 
Written and composed by GEORGE M EEN. 
Sang by EDWIN BARRY. 
His latest hit. 
No doubt you have heard of the great fancy fair, 
That used to take place every day; 
Well, I 
thought for amusement I'd take my girl there, 
To pass a 
dull hour away; 
We went in you must know, and saw Barnum's show, 
Van Amburgh's menagerie, as well; 
There were round-about swings, and all kinds of things 
Forget the day I 
never shall. 
DIALOGUE.—Yes! when we got in the fair, my girl 
wanted to have a 
ride in the swing. 
I 
said, all right, my 
darling; but directly the swing went a 
little too high, sh9 
lustily cried— 
Cuonus: 
Oh, Fred, tell them to stop, 
That was the cry of Maria; 
The more she said whoa, they said, let it go, 
And the swing went a 
little bit higher. 
The people that stood round of course they all laughed 
But I 
only said, stop the swing; 
There were four or five others in boats beside us, 
Saying, master don't do such a 
thing; 
Then four or five roughs caught hold of the ropes, 
Maria fell down on her knees; 
And one of them said, the young man's getting red, 
But isn't he having a 
spree. 
DIALOGUE.—And Maria still cried out at the top of her 
voice— ( Chorus). 
They soon stopped the swing, Maria jumped out, 
And quickly fell down on the floor; 
They brought her some water, which soon brought 
her to, 
The girl I 
now do adore; 
Should you ever go there, to the great fancy fair, 
Friends, take advice while I 
sing; 
Of the great round- about, it's the best fun that's out, 
And finish the day with a 
swing. 
DIALOGUE.—And when you take a 
girl with 
her promise she won't call out— 
you, make 
(Chorus).

ALL ON ACCOUNT OF ELIZA. 
Music published by OLIVER DITSON & CO., Boston, Mass. 
Price, 
cents. 
As sung in the Opera of " Billee Taylor" by 
TONY PASTOR AND COMPANY. 
The yarn as I'm about to spin, 
Is all on account of Eliza; 
I'll tell you how I 
was taken in, 
All on account of Eliza; 
She said that she'd ever be true to one, 
But she bolted away with a 
son of a 
gun! 
So I 
cut my stick and to sea I 
run, 
That it's all on account of Eliza. 
CHORUS: 
All on account, all on account, 
All on account of Eliza; 
He cut his stick and to sea he run, 
All on account of Eliza. 
I've nearly been blown away in a 
gale, 
All on account of Eliza; 
And I've almost been eaten up by a 
whale, 
All on account of Eliza; 
I've had sword cuts by dozens, and I've been sho,, 
through, 
I've had yellow fever and also the blue; 
I've been bitten by sharks, and by crocodiles, too, 
All on account of Eliza. 
CHORUS: 
All on account, all on account, 
All on account of Eliza; 
He's been bitten by sharks, and by crocodiles, too 
All on account of Eliza. 
ALL ON ACCOUNT OF ELIZA—CONTINUED. 
My duty is now, smart lads, to press, 
All on account of Eliza; 
If they say " No!" why I 
say " Yes!" 
All on account of Eliza; 
So look up, my messmates, some boys for the sea; 
And if to your summons they do not agree, 
Why, shiver my timbers, just tell 'em from me, 
That it's all on account of Eliza. 
CHORUS: 
All on account, all on account, 
All on account of Eliza; 
Why, shiver my timbers, just tell 'em says he, 
That it's all on account of Eliza. 
I've courted the ladies all through my life, 
All on account of Eliza; 
But never could steer to the proper wife, 
All on account of Eliza; 
I've kissed and I've hugged them in ev'ry port, 
The fat and the lean, the tall and the short; 
But somehow or other, they weren't my sort, 
All on account of Eliza. 
CHORUS: 
All on account, all on account, 
All on account of Eliza; 
But somehow or other, they weren't my sort,

MARY ANN, I'LL TELL YOUR MA. 
Written and Composed by GEOFFREY THORN. Sung with reat success 
by TONY PASTOR, America's own vocalist, 
this 
song is published by permission of E. H. HARDING, 
229 Bowery, New York. 
Price 10 cents. 
I 
spoon a 
girl named,Mary Ann, a 
tender little dove, 
Who costs me lots of half-pence, and a 
precious deal of love; 
She's living with her mother, as a 
maiden ought to do, 
And looks as straight and proper as a 
saint, or me or you. 
But somehow when I 
trot her round, no matter where we go, 
I'm struck with all the people that this maiden seems to 
know ; 
For certain as Mary Ann I 
proudly take about, 
Some heads pop round the corner, and a 
vulgar voice will 
shoat— 
Cnonus: 
Oh, very well, Mary Ann, I'll tell your Ma, 
She little thought when you came out you'd go so far; 
I'm sure your mother doesn't know the girl you are, 
Mary Ann, fie! for shame, Yah! yah! yah! Oh! yah! 
We went last Whitsun Monday to the forest by the rail, 
We did the thing first class of course, at that I 
never fail, 
I 
tipp'd the guard a 
shilling, or what you might call a 
bob, 
To lock us in a 
carriage and preserve us from the mob. 
We sat on downy cushions and the curtains drew for fun, 
For Polly said her pretty eyes they could not bear the sun; 
But when we settled snugly and were just about to go, 
A head came through the window and a 
fellow shouted— 
(Chorus). 
29. 
MARY ANN, 
I'LL TELL YOUR MA . —CONTINUED. 
We wander'd through the forest glades as happy as could be, 
We thought from vulgar people there, we should at least 
be free; 
We sought a 
sweet secluded spot, where none our vows 
could hear, 
And whisper'd those soft, silly things, that lovers think so 
dear. 
We sat beneath a 
spreading oak, our loving arms entwined, 
While I 
was fond and foolish, she was gentle, sweet and 
kind; 
But just as I 
my passion told, and sealed it with a 
kiss, 
A chap birds-nesting up above, so rudely shouted this— 
(Chorus) 
We came away disgusted, and we quickly made for home, 
For everywhere we met the cry, no matter where we'd 
roam; 
My Mary Ann declared to me she knew those people not, 
In fact, she said she would not mix with such a 
vulgar lot. 
But on this precious mystery I 
have some little doubt, 
And almost think that Mary Ann museknow her way about; 
For when we parted at her door, or rather just inside, 
A voice came down the staircase, and her little brother 
cried— 
SOKEN.—Oh 
oh! oh! 
(Chorus).

My name is O'Brien from Harlem, 
An Irishman as you can see; 
I 
can sing like a 
thrush or a 
starling, 
Or the little bird up in a 
tree. 
But the gang that stands there on the corner, 
Are trying the steps and the dance; 
And they shout out whenever I'm passing, 
There's O'Brien with his high-water pants. 
Crtortus: 
They tell me to g0 over to England, 
And pay a 
short visit to France; 
And there to bring out my new fashions, 
And call them the high-water pants. 
Last week I 
went to the theatre, 
Along with my first cousin Dan; 
We hired a 
seat down in the parquette, 
Behind the big man in the band. 
When a 
nager came out with a 
banjo. 
He played up a 
high-land clog dance; 
And he gave out a 
gag and a 
eon-nun-drum, 
'Bout O'Brien and his high-water pants. 
Churns. 
One night as I 
strolled down the Bowery, 
Along with a 
friend, Paddy Brock. 
We tho't we'd just drop into Geoghan's, 
To try some of his rye and rock. 
When the gang all cried there's Dan O'Leary, 
The bar-keeper shot me a 
glance; 
" 
Howld your tongues " then said he to the loafers 
That's O'Brien with his high-water pants. 
Chorus..

A 
VIOLET FROM MOTHER'S GRAVE. 
Words and Music by WILL H. Fox. 
Sung by W E. McALooN in all the principal Theatres in America, and 
by O'NEn. & CONROY. 
Scenes of my childhood arise before my gaze, 
Bringing recollections of my childhood's happy days; 
When down in the meadow in childhood I 
would roam, 
But there's no one left to cheer now within ray good 
old home; 
Father and Mother they have passed away, 
Sister and Brother are laid beneath the clay; 
But while life does remain, there's one thing I'll retain, 
A 
small Violet I 
plucked from Mother's Grave. 
CHORUS: 
Only a 
Violet I 
plucked when but a 
boy, 
And often when I'm sad at heart, this plant has 
give me joy; 
But while life does remain, in memorium I'll retain, 
That small violet I 
plucked from Mother's Grave. 
How well I 
remember my dear old Mother's smile, 
As she used to greet me when I 
returned from toil; 
Always knitting in the old arm chair, 
Father used to sit and read for all us children there; 
But now all is silent around the good old home, 
They all have left me in sorrow for to roam; 
While life does remain, there's one thing I'll retain, 
A 
small Violet I 
plucked from Mother's Grave. 
(Chorus).

Copyright, 1878, by HARRISON MILLARD. 
Sung with tremendous success by W . 
FRED ArmAlt, America's 
Greatest Grotesque Clown. 
There it stands in the corner with its back to the wall, 
The old wooden rocker so stately and tall; 
With naught to disturb it but the duster or broom. 
For no one now uses that back parlor room; 
Oh, how well I 
remember in days long gone by, 
When we stood by that rocker, my sister and I; 
And we listened to the stories that our grandma would tell 
By that old wooden rocker we all loved so well. 
CHoRus: 
As she sat by the fire she would rock, rock, rock, 
And we heard but the tick of the old brass clock; 
Eighty years she had sat in that chair grim and tall, 
In that old wooden rocker that stood by the wall. 
If this chair could but speak, oh, the tales it could tell, 
How poor aged grandpa in fierce battle fell; 
'Neath the stars and the stripes he fought bravely and true 
lie cherished his freedom, the red, white and blue; 
It could tell of bright days and of dark ones, beside, 
Of the day when dear grandma stood forth as a 
bride; 
This is why we all love it, this old chair grim and tall, 
The old wooden rocker that stands by the wall. 
(Chorus). 
But poor grandma is gone, and her stories are done, 
Her children have followed her, yes, one by one; 
They have all gone to meet her " in the sweet by and-bye," 
And all that is left is dear sister and I; 
Never more will we hide her gold specks or her cap, 
Never more will we tease her while taking her nap; 
Never more will she slumber in that chair grim and tall, 
The old wooden rocker that stood by the wall.

Soft lilies and the rose

See when the moonlight falls on the streamlet 
Silvering each ripple with its brilliant rays; 
Out in the midnight making the heart light, 
Waking up the little birds before the break of day. 
Tickling and teasing, kissing and squeezing. 
Telling lots of little fibs and swearing they are true: 
Some say its naughty, others very pleasing. 
Just wait one moment and I'll tell you what to do.

Homeward retreating, a

Because she must bid you the last good night: 
She fondly wishes those stolen kisses 
Would last till the morning's broad daylight.

Carefully she raises the latch with her key; 
See then the dear miss rushes for the last kiss,

They thought to make us early birds,

If the police don't know us now, 
I'm sure they never will.

I 
went to the village school, 
And I 
proved so uncommon quick, 
That I 
galloped all through my geography, 
And I 
skipped my arithmetic. 
And ray writing was " up and down," 
In a 
new and original style, 
And I 
jumped clean over the globes, I 
did, 
I 
was so volatile. 
I 
was so volatile, I 
was so volatile, 
E'en the Rule of Three was naught to me, 
I 
was so volatile. 
3 
Then didn't I 
love the girls, 
And didn't the girls love me; 
But I 
never could keep to one you know, 
I 
AM SO VOLATILE. Concluded. 
Through this infirmity. 
For as soon as Mary Ann 
Had inveigled me with her smile, 
I 
was " off " again to Betsy Jane, 
I 
was so volatile. 
I 
was so volatile, I 
was so volatile, 
I 
never could stop the question to pop, 
I 
was so volatile. 
4 
Then I 
joined the Volunteers, 
And I 
raced the corps for a 
wager: 
But I 
couldn't keep still at the weekly drill, 
In spite of the Sergeant Major. 
And it ever I'm called to face 
The foe in rank and file, 
I 
very much fear I 
shan't be " near," 
I 
am so volatile. 
I 
am so volatile, I 
am so volatile, 
I 
fear I 
might be " out of sight," 
I 
am so volatile. 
I 
got more active still 
In the course of my career, 
For my Uncle Bill left we in his will 
Ten thousand pounds a 
year. 
That my poor relations grieve 
And despair, there's no denial, 
For I 
hear them cry, He never will die, 
He is so volatile. 
Yes, I 
am so volatile, oh, I 
am so volatile, 
They fume and fret, but nothing they'll get 
While I'm so volatile. 
(In an old man's voice.) 
6 
But now I'm getting old, 
My hair is thin and grey; 
And my voice is so weak, I 
can hardly speak, 
And I've rheumatiz they say. 
But as for my blessed limbs 
They're just as juvenile, 
For they riggle and riot, and won't keep quiet, 
They are so volatile. 
I 
am so volatile. I 
am so volatile, 
Tho' I'm getting old, yet still I'm told, 
I'm just as volatile.

In England your roses make mighty fine posies, 
Provoke Scotia's thistle you meet your reward; 
But share for its beauty an Irishman's duty, 
Will teach him his own native plant to regard. 
St. Patrick he set it, with dewdrops he wet it, 
And often to cherish and bless it was seen, 
Its verdures are rare too, it's fresh and it's fair too, 
And blooms but in Ireland's own Island of green. 
The sweet little Island, &e.

A 
sprig from each stem, forms a

More brilliantly bright than the dew on the thorn,

long may they flourish, may heavens dews nourish, 
Each warm kindred soil whe-fe the emblems are seen, 
May no fatal blunder, e'er tear them asunder, 
But long be they wreath'd in the Island of green. 
The sweet little Island, cte.

Success to old Ireland, its bog and its mireland, 
There's not such a 
universe under the sun, 
For honor, for spirit, Fidelity, merit, 
For wit and good fellowship, frolic and fun. 
With wine and with whiskey when once he gets frisky, 
An Irishman's heart in true colors is seen ; 
While with mirth overflowing, with love it is glowing, 
With love for its own native Island of green. 
The sweet little Island, ct-e.

She'll sing and she'll dance to the old mill clack, 
And the song that she sings " Will my love come back," 
Till her old grandpa with his long white hair, 
Laughs aloud till the tears down his cheeks run clear; 
And the lads in the village they know right well, 
What a 
charmer exists in that rustic dell. 
I 
love her all the better, its a 
fact what I 
say, 
She's as lively as a

How my heart goes bump when I 
think of the day 
That we both first met in the new mown hay, 
She looked like a 
rose with a 
delicate blush, 
Or a 
sweet water lily all among the rush. 
I 
sighed, " Pretty Polly, what a 
witch you are." 
And she said, get along, or I'll tell Grandpa." 
She's just like an angel that sweetly sings, 
I 
should really think she is, but she's got no wings.

said I 
loved her to distraction, 
I 
spoke to her old crusty dad; 
Gave him every satisfaction 
As to how much coin I 
had. 
And he gave me his permission, 
it I 
could, his child to wed ; 
Still she would not calmly listen 
To the loving words I 
said, 
But blushed and murmured, "stop that, mister," 
When I 
caught her in my arms, 
And if I 
but only kissed her 
She was filled with dreadful qualms, 
She'd struggle in my arms and cry: 
Oh! let me go, or I 
shall die.

At last one evening I 
did meet her, 
In a 
most retired spot; 
And I 
with a 
kiss did greet her, 
Ere she'd time to tell me not, 
And I 
quickly did discover 
That she was not now afraid, 
When I 
acted as a 
lover 
Soon great progress then I 
made. 
Married life she said she'd like it, 
And she'd gladly marry me: 
So a 
bargain we did strike it, 
And my wife she'll shortly be, 
And when arrives the happy day 
'When I 
squeeze her she won't say—

Georgie now you frighten me; 
We'll spend our future days at Dover, 
But I 
won't give over or let her be.

When courting time with us begins, 
And love is in its prime, 
The only fellow for making love, 
Is he who drinks his wine. 
You never find him bashful, 
The wine fills him with life, 
lie don't speak unheard, but out with the word, 
Will you be mine own darling wife? 
He don't speak unheard, but out with the word, 
Will you be mine own darling wife?

3. 
And when old age creeps on the scene, 
Our hair is turning grey, 
Louis Renouf fills us with life, 
And makes us young as May. 
Then happy's the man that is married, 
To the girl he's made his wife, 
The horse he drives, the wine he drinks, 
Then he's led a 
jolly good life, 
The horse he drives, the wine he drinks, 
For he's led a 
jolly good life. 
Cuo:—For Louis,lienours the wine for me, &e.

THE OLD FASHIONED HOME. 
Sang by NED BARRY at HARRIGAN & HART'S Theatre Comique, 
Broadway, New York. 
There's an old fashioned house in the old country, 
There's an old fashioned couple live there; 
There's an old fashioned gate by the old country road,. 
And an old fashioned man near the chair; 
An old fashioned woman is sitting there. 
Darning an old pair of hose; 
With her old fashioned cap on her old fashioned head 
And she's dressed in her old fashioned clothes. 
CHORUS : 
Hear those bells, those merry bells, 
And they fill my- soul with a 
thrill; 
'Tis the old fashioned sound from them old fashioned bells, 
In that old fashioned church on the hill. 
There's an old fashioned clock on that old whitewashed 
wall, 
With its old fashioned pendulum and hands; 
There's an old wooden bench by that old fireplace, 
With its bright copper kettles and pans; 
An old fashioned man is sitting there, 
Smoking his old fashioned clay; 
With his old favorite dog sitting close by his side, 
Watching the children at play: 
Heaven bless that dear old pair, may they live for many 
years, 
In that dear, little house in the lane; 
May they never know a 
care, but all happiness to share 
And think of the dear, old happy days; 
The same I 
wish to you, with a 
heart of conscience true 
May you live, yes, for many, many years; 
May you never want for wealth, but enjoy the best of 
health, 
It is the earnest wish I 
give to you.
