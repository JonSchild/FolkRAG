According to my Lomax  f
ile--which  is
 in my normal  state
 
of  d
i sarray --
the article  I found by your mother  on cowboy
 
culture was  in  the Overland Monthl y of January  1912.
 I read
 
and took notes from  it  at  the UCLA Research Li brary,  and  I
 
assume most bi g libraries 
 woul d have  it
.
 I hope you can
 
track  
 it down
 
Be t  regards.

a

was a
 complex man who has become a
 Texas I

Lomax
's ambition was t
o be a
 professor a

was t
hwarted despite h

urned t

He was "
a rare combination o

Southern f
