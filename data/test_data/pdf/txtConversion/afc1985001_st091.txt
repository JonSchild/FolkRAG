RING DING BILLY DING 5121 A1
Bill Jackson Arvin, 1941
Ring-ding-billy-ding cow-hee Play on little tom, play on he Call little Bill tum a ring-ding billy
ding, cow-hee
Saw a hawk set tin' on a limb He winked at me and I winked at him Tum a ring-ding-billy-
ding cow-hee Play on little tom, play on he Call little Bill tum a ring-ding-billy-ding, cow-hee
Went to the house to get my gun First at a walk and then at a run Tum a ring-ding-billy-
ding cow-hee Play on little tom, play on he Call little Bill tum a ring-ding-billy-ding, cow-hee
Shot at the hawk and missed my mark Shot my old black sow clean to the heart
Tum a ring-ding-billy-ding cow-hee Play on little tom, play on he Call little Bill tum a ring-
ding-billy-ding, cow-hee
Buried my old sow under the house Always had blood pudding and souse Tum a ring-ding-
billy-ding cow-hee Play on little tom, play on he Call little Bill tum a ring-ding-billy-ding,
cow-hee
My saddle and bridle hangin' under the shelf If you want any more you can sing it yourself
Tum a ring-ding-billy-ding cow-hee Play on little tom, play on he Call little Bill tum a ring-
ding-billy-ding, cow-hee
