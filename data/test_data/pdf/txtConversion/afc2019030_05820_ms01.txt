LG: 
Okay. My name is Lisa Gabbert, and today is September 20th, 2019. And I am talking 
today with Dr. Bill Walsh, as part of the Physician Oral History project. 
 
 
Thank you for agreeing to do an interview. You know you’re being recorded? 
 
BW: 
You’re welcome; yes.

LG: 
Okay. And for the record, can you state your birth year, please?  
 
BW: 
1969. 
 
LG: 
Okay, great; thank you.  
 
 
The first question I wanted to start with is if you could just describe (very briefly) your 
medical training: the years you went to medical school, where you went to medical 
school, your residency, etc., etc.? 
 
BW: 
I went to medical school at Indiana University School of Medicine. I started in 1999; I 
finished in 2004 (because I did an MPH program, because my wife was finishing grad 
school). I went to residency in Internal Medicine at the University of Utah from 2004 to 
2007. And then I did a fellowship in Pulmonary Critical Care Medicine, from 2007 to 
2010. I did research year after that. 
 
LG: 
Okay. And where do you currently work? 
 
BW: 
I do Addiction Medicine, and I have a clinic called Sovegna (S-O-V-E-G-N-A), which 
does – basically, we do psychiatric and internal medicine care for people with substance 
use disorder, or addiction. 
 
LG: 
Okay. And that’s here, in Salt Lake City? 
 
BW: 
It’s in Salt Lake City, yeah. 
 
LG: 
Okay; great, thank you. 
 
 
So, I’m going to start very broadly. How did you decide to become a doctor? 
 
BW: 
Oh, god [chuckles]. Well I guess I had resisted the notion. My father is a surgeon, and I 
resisted the notion of being a physician, because I didn’t want to be gone doing work – 
like as the only thing I did. I guess that was my view of doctors: is that they only worked. 
So, I kind of resisted the notion.  
 
 
And then my spouse was in a – well my almost spouse (we were not married yet) was in 
a PhD program and I was bored and decided I was either going to do a PhD in 
psychology or go to medical school. And after kind of revisiting psychology, I decided it 
was mostly smoke and mirrors, and decided to go to medical school.  
 
[02:43] 
 
 
[Laughs] So, a non-traditional approach; I did not want to be a doctor my whole life. So, I 
like science and I like talking to people and I didn’t want to sit behind a desk all day. So, 
those were my reasonings. And I was smart and I could – that was my other –

[Laughter] 
 
LG: 
Can you describe what’s it like to get into medical school? How do you do it? 
 
BW: 
So, basically you have to take, you know, certain courses, and take the MCAT (which is 
sort of a standardized exam); and then there is – yeah, there is a formalized program that 
everyone goes through, called ERES – electronic resident – not a resident, that’s actually 
a different, that’s for residency.  
 
 
Anyway, there’s a standardized form you fill out for most medical schools, and then 
there’s a secondary application for each school. So, you fill out this standard form with 
all your grades, and you get letters, and all that usual stuff people do. And you kind of get 
charged by the number of schools, so you kind of have to limit it.  
 
 
So, you go through this sort of mass application series, and then you get a series of 
secondary applications, and you do interviews all over and sort of wait to hear. It’s not 
like regular grad school, where you kind of get a bunch of letters all at once – or maybe, I 
don’t know, other grad schools are different.  
 
 
You get letters on a rolling basis, and you can kind of accept at one place. And then when 
the next letter comes in, you can decide if you want to accept that one, and then not do 
the other one [laughs]. 
 
 
So, yeah – I’d get acceptances and decide whether or not you wanted to take them. And 
then at the risk of taking one, and then – you know, if you accept one, you don’t have to 
necessarily go there.  
 
 
So, like the last person to get into my class – Indiana University was the second biggest 
med school class – so, the last person to get into my med school found out the day before 
that she was accepted. Because someone else had gotten accepted somewhere else, and 
then left IU; and so, she got a spot. So, it’s pretty crazy, actually. [Laughs] 
 
[04:48] 
 
LG: 
How did you feel when you found out you got in? 
 
BW: 
It was relief – because I needed something to do [laughs], I was so bored. I don’t know – 
just regular jobs were not very appealing to me. I had been doing sort of computer stuff, 
and I just was super bored at it, and needed something a little bit more challenging 
(which medicine was, for sure, and still is). 
 
 
Yeah, other people like get super excited and enthusiastic, and I had more like a sense of, 
[exhales] “Okay, good.” 
 
 
I also got into where my wife was in grad school, which was nice. So, I wasn’t sure that 
that was going to happen, because nothing is guaranteed.

LG: 
For the record, his wife is me. 
 
BW: 
[Laughs] 
 
LG: 
I am interviewing my husband; when he says his wife, that is me. 
 
BW: 
Yeah, that’s true. 
 
LG: 
Okay. For people who don’t know, which is the majority of people – what is medical 
school like? Can you describe that a little bit? 
 
BW: 
Well so, I can only talk about my experience. Every medical school is different. Indiana 
University has nine campuses, and each one of those is different in the way they set 
things up.  
 
 
 
The campus I went to, which was Bloomington for the first few years, and then 
Indianapolis for the last two (for the clinical years) –  
 
 
They basically have two years of coursework: it’s about 20-22 credits of work a semester. 
Everyone is in the same classes; you have class from like eight to five, and then you just 
do homework all night. There are exams – for us, there were exams all the time. So, there 
was that grinding stuff.  
 
 
And then there’s lab components. So, like for anatomy you have to dissect a person (a 
cadaver), and then know all the parts of – like anything is fair game. Like really, any 
small structure, like the smallest thing is fair game for the exams. So, there’s a fair 
amount of anxiety that’s there, all the time, for everyone, and people respond to it in 
really interesting ways [laughs]. 
 
[06:56] 
 
LG: 
Can you talk about that a little bit? 
 
BW: 
Yeah. I mean, some people, you know, wind up cheating – so, there were people kicked 
out of our class, like one at the end of second year (so, she had gone through two years of 
school, and then was expelled). Because they don’t – if you get caught cheating, you’re 
out.  
 
 
And you know, she was second in the class, so she wasn’t like she was a bad student; she 
just wanted to be first, and so I think she cheated on one question and got caught doing it, 
which is fairly insane, honestly. 
 
 
I don’t know, some people start drinking, some people – you just become really jerks. 
There is a fair amount of personality change. And then transitioning from classes to sort 
Physician Oral History: Bill Walsh  
Page 5 
 
of clinical work – it’s a lot more humbling when you’re working with actual people and 
actual disease, because there’s not like a right answer that ever comes out.  
 
 
I mean, you know, someone has pneumonia, it’s usually fairly obvious, except when it 
isn’t. You know, pneumonia can look like heart failure, heart failure can look like 
pneumonia. You can have all kinds of things that are complicating it, or it can be an 
autoimmune disease. So, that’s fairly humbling.  
 
 
And like you think you’re busy the first few years, and then you go to the third year, and 
it’s busier still; and then you go to residency, and it’s busier still [laughs]. And then 
fellowship, and you’re busier still. So, there’s progressive collapse and removal of free 
time.  
 
LG: 
When you said people become jerks in terms of personality changes – can you talk about 
that? 
 
BW: 
I just was thinking of particular people in my class, and I don’t really feel comfortable 
talking about them. It just like went from being –  
 
 
There was a basketball coach at IU called Bobby Knight, who strangled a student and 
then was fired for that. He was a very popular basketball coach. And people were so 
weird about that. Like anyone who thought it was right that he should be fired, they 
wouldn’t talk –  
 
[09:10] 
 
 
So, usually when faculty strangle students, they should be fired. Like he lifted him up by 
the neck with his hand –  
 
LG: 
What does it have to do with the medical students? 
 
BW: 
Oh, because like there just was this response to it from the med students. It was half-way 
through first year, and people just got like – were vicious and weird about that sort of 
behavior, which I think in a normal context wouldn’t happen. Because there just was no 
other outlet to express yourself.  
 
LG: 
And when you say after the first two years of classwork it became more humbling – 
medical school became more humbling – can you talk about that? 
 
BW: 
Well yeah – just when you see patients – I mean, it’s easy to be right on a question, right? 
Like you have a test question, it has a right or wrong answer, and that’s it. Like there’s 
certainty, right? So, but with patients, there’s not certainty; and a lot of the things that 
you think you know about clinical medicine turn out – not that they’re wrong, but that 
you misapply them, or you don’t understand it, or you have –  
 
Physician Oral History: Bill Walsh  
Page 6 
 
 
Anyway, so the people who are super – a lot of people were super arrogant the first two 
years, actually became more pleasant by the end of third and fourth year, because they 
just ran into repeated failure [laughs] and humiliation.  
 
 
So, you know, when you see patients, you see them as an individual initially, and then 
you see them with your intern or your resident, and then you go on rounds with the team, 
which includes an attending (a licensed physician), a senior resident (sometimes multiple 
levels of residents) – an intern, who is a first-year resident, and other medical students.  
 
 
So, then you talk about your patient first, and then you have to sort of know everything 
about it. And it’s just an awkward transition, because it’s not like regular life, where you 
sort of you know, have time to sort of adjust to stuff; you sort of have to make decisions 
pretty quickly.  
 
 
And you know, when you’re wrong, it has consequences for real people. So, you can’t – 
there’s not a lot of wiggle room and people will let you know that you’re wrong in [no] 
uncertain terms.  
 
[11:24] 
 
 
So, you know, you’ll hear things like, you know, “You sure slept a lot for a person who 
doesn’t read much.” So [laughs] –  
 
LG: 
My. 
 
BW: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
What was the hardest thing about medical school? 
 
BW: 
I think it just was the – you know, the relentlessness. I mean like, you know, like 
pediatric surgery, I think I would go home a lot, you know, at two in the morning, and 
then I’d have to go back at four. So, that’s not an easy physical thing to do. And then, you 
know, I didn’t see you, you know, sometimes at all.  
 
 
Like I’d come home and you’d be like, “You’re leaving,” [laughing] you’d say, “You’re 
leaving again?” Because I’d come home at two in the morning, and then I’d get up at, 
you know, 3:50 to get to the hospital at 4:10 or something for rounds.  
 
 
And just, you know, it’s physically difficult, and then it’s hard to not see anyone outside 
the context of school.  
 
LG: 
And what was the best thing? 
 
BW: 
Yeah, I did learn a lot and I got to be very good at making decisions in the face of 
uncertainty, and, you know, just learned that I could actually be good at making a 
Physician Oral History: Bill Walsh  
Page 7 
 
diagnosis and treating it fairly quickly. So, that was – so, you know, by the end of that, I 
actually felt like a reasonable physician. So, that was pretty rewarding.  
 
 
[Laughs] Yeah, I mean – it’s a lot harder than people think it is. So, it’s not – I don’t 
know, the only medical show that ever got the culture of medicine right was Scrubs. So, 
like the – although surgery and medicine wouldn’t share call rooms together. But just sort 
of that relentless grind of everyone always wearing clothes, and like just feeling dirty and 
sort of worn down. And like, the crazy people that work at the hospital [laughs]. 
 
[13:35] 
 
LG: 
Can you talk about your residency and fellowship training a little bit? Because a lot of 
people don’t understand the difference between medical school and residency.  
 
BW: 
Yeah. So, after you get your MD degree, you’re actually not allowed to practice medicine 
in any state; you have to at least do one or two years of residency training, which is 
basically post-graduate training. So, you go and do a particular specialty; you know, ones 
people know about would be like pediatrics, or family practice, or orthopedics (which is 
bones).  
 
 
So, I did internal medicine, which is sort of adult medicine – it’s like pediatrics, but for 
grown-ups – for my residency. And so, basically, that’s a three-year process. The first 
year is – I guess they don’t really call it intern year anymore, although everyone still 
does; it’s your R1 year (your first year of residency). 
 
 
And then you go from medical school, where you finally think you know something, and 
then you are immersed and actually having some progressive levels of responsibility. 
And you have more patients than you did when you were a medical student – so again, 
there’s this sort of difficulty in keeping up with what’s happening with patients, and 
making decisions.  
 
 
So, we also had a baby the first year, so I was exhausted from that – that definitely 
impinged on my reality of my training. And you know, most of the other residents didn’t 
have an infant and a wife who was a first-year faculty member. So, that was physically 
challenging, and then difficult to manage in terms of time. Because you really don’t have 
much free time, there’s just not –  
 
 
You know, we would do 30 hours on call. You’d come in at six in the morning and you’d 
get off at noon the next day. And you know, try to get all your work done in that 30-hour 
period. And then you’d have a little bit of time off, come back the next day, and then do it 
again [laughs]. So, it was pretty rough. 
 
[15:44] 
 
LG: 
And call – what does that mean? 
 
Physician Oral History: Bill Walsh  
Page 8 
 
BW: 
So, call for interns and residents means that you’re in the hospital. The reason they call 
residents “residents,” is that they used to live in the hospital. And the reason they also call 
house staff is that you’re just there all the time. And so, it was the people who are always 
in the hospital.  
 
 
People don’t live in the hospital anymore, but you spend an awful lot of time there. So, 
when you’re a resident you may have – you’ve got a bed, you may see that bed, you may 
not. I mean, there’s the old joke of, you know, you see a bed, sleep in it; you see a donut, 
eat a donut. And don’t touch the pancreas [laughs], it’s in a different role.  
 
 
But yeah, I mean – often on call, so you’d get there at six am, and you (theoretically) 
could go lay down when you had free time. But the first half of the year, you really don’t 
– you can’t do it, because you’re just working and trying to figure things out: trying to 
figure how to do things.  
 
 
And you know, if you have a good resident backing you up, you can get some sleep; but 
you know, sometimes you don’t – sometimes your resident like, is gone, or is sleeping, or 
just isn’t super smart – so you’ve got to pick up the load.  
 
LG: 
What does that mean, “Don’t touch the pancreas?” 
 
BW: 
Oh, the pancreas is a sensitive organ, so for surgeons (or if you’re doing things), you 
want to make sure you don’t knock that off-balance, because people think of pancreatitis 
as being painful – but you could dissolve yourself, essentially. 
 
LG: 
Ah [laughs]. 
 
BW: 
Die – not as a resident, but the patient. 
 
LG: 
Can you (briefly) describe – I know there’s no typical day for residency, but –  
 
BW: 
Yeah, a theoretical typical day? 
 
LG: 
A theoretical typical day for internal medicine? 
 
[17:41] 
 
BW: 
So, you get there between five and six in the morning (depending on your patient load), 
and if you know what the heck is going on, and kind of get what’s called “check out” 
from the resident that was covering your patients before. So, you just run through the list 
of patients you have, and hope and pray that nothing bad happened while you were gone.  
 
 
And then you go see them, and sort of find out a) what happened – like actually, like so 
you find out what happened from the other resident; but then make sure that that actually 
happened by looking at them and checking the chart, and talking to the nurses.  
 
Physician Oral History: Bill Walsh  
Page 9 
 
 
And then you go to team rounds. So you sort of sit down – depends; sometimes you do 
sit-down rounds first – so, you sit down and talk about all the patients with the lead 
resident and the attending on the service. And then you go do walk-arounds; or you just 
do walk-arounds and do everything while you’re walking about and seeing people.  
 
 
So, at that point – that’s when (actually) the final decisions are made, is when you are at 
the bedside, with the – theoretically with the nurse and any other support staff. And kind 
of communicate the plan to the patient, who may or may not understand anything you’re 
talking about because they might be super out of it, or demented, or [laughs] don’t speak 
English, or whatever. So, it’s the imperfect system. But that’s sort of intern year. 
 
 
And then as a resident, what you would do is you would come in and sort of more 
quickly see all the patients (because you’re hoping your interns are covering the detail 
work), and then do the same thing, you know: either sit-down rounds, or walk-arounds 
with the attending at the bedside. And it varies by service.  
 
 
So, like I know orthopedic surgery will see all their patients really quickly and then do x-
ray rounds, and then go into the OR. And internal medicine, we would spend, you know – 
we would probably finish rounding around noon, or hopefully before lunch conference.  
 
[19:55] 
 
 
Then there’s a conference at lunch – food may or may not be provided. And there’s a 
lecture, which you’re sort of required to go to, unless you’re like, you know, admitting a 
patient in the ER or some other reason.  
 
 
And then you sort of spend the rest of the day doing the things you talked about: getting 
procedures done, doing procedures, and straightening patients out. And if you’re not on 
call that night, you can go home between – well theoretically between two o’clock and 
five; but usually around four or five o’clock those days.  
 
 
If you’re on-call, then you take check out from all the other residents, and if you know – 
typically, then you’d start admitting new patients at that point, and admit them through 
until six in the morning the next day (just continuously, sometimes). [Laughs] Just one 
after the other.  
 
LG: 
What’s one of the most memorable things that happened during your residency? 
 
BW: 
Oh, Lord. I don’t know. I mean, there’s so many weird things.  
 
 
I mean, there was a guy whose boot I pulled off (to look at his feet) and his toe came off 
with it. It was kind of gross and memorable (but not in a good way). 
 
 
Yeah, and there’s patients you really help. Like there was a guy with Parkinson’s we 
admitted, who just couldn’t get his meds right. And so, we wound up admitting him and 
spent a couple weeks getting those meds straightened out. And he walked out and was 
Physician Oral History: Bill Walsh  
Page 10 
 
able to function for another couple years before he sort of lapsed into, you know, the end 
stage of the disease. 
 
 
Or you know, and then there’s like small stuff. Like there was a guy with HIV who just 
had, you know (this was the early 2000s, and I was training) – and he had contracted HIV 
in the mid-‘90s and his partner had died and had had a horrible exposure to the drugs that 
were available then. And we convinced him that the drugs available now really weren’t 
so bad, and he got better.  
 
 
So, we diagnosed a kind of pneumonia that you only get with AIDS in him, and then 
convinced him to then take, not only the antibiotics for that, but when he was finished 
medications treating his illness overall. So, those were rewarding. 
 
[22:35] 
 
 
And just a lot of small stuff like that. I mean, you know, sometimes it’s you know, like 
really long codes – like family just won’t give up, but the patient’s pretty dead. So, we 
just be doing it for a time [laughs]. Like one woman wound up being flat afterwards – 
like we had broken all her ribs, and she was dead for probably ten minutes before we got 
there. But the family just didn’t want to stop. And we finally just said, “We’re not doing 
this anymore. This is insane.” And wrapped that up. 
 
 
So, yeah – those are just hard things to do, you know? 
 
LG: 
What about memorable moments with residents? I mean, kind of either good or bad? 
 
BW: 
Oh, yeah. It’s just – it’s funny. I mean, I don’t know. I mean, there was a resident in my 
class and our teams were on call at the same time. And she got a viral gastroenteritis – 
she was pretty sick. But there was no one to cover her, so she had to stay. So, we gave her 
an IV pole and anti-nausea drugs phenergan. And she just walked around and did rounds 
with an IV pole on and got fluids the whole time. And you know, we gave her Imodium 
so the diarrhea sort of stopped. But you know, it was comical and sad at the same time.  
 
LG: 
Was that typical? Or is that unusual? 
 
BW: 
It happened a lot. [Laughs] I mean, there’s just not a lot of backup, right? So, there’s 
residents that are on service, who are like on some outpatient service, but they’re not 
always available to come in on call, or they, you know, don’t answer their pager, or they 
went skiing or something. You know, we live in Utah, so there’s – if they had a day off 
and they’re up in the mountains, they don’t get their page. And they come down, and then 
they’re like, “Oh, oops.” 
 
[24:43] 
 
LG: 
[Laughs]  
 
Physician Oral History: Bill Walsh  
Page 11 
 
BW: 
And you also didn’t want to make your fellow resident come in on those days. So, you 
felt that obligation to go to work when you were sick. 
 
LG: 
Why is that? 
 
BW: 
Just because you’re so tired, and when you get a chance to do something easier – 
especially if you know that that person has got like two young kids at home, or 
something, and she was doing outpatient, and she had been looking forward to seeing 
them forever – you don’t want to call her in and be like, “Hey, can you cover me on call 
tonight? Because I don’t feel so good.”  
 
 
So, you know, you’re like, “I’m just going to go to work and suck it up.” It’s called 
presenteeism and it’s sort of a problem. 
 
LG: 
Presenteeism? 
 
BW: 
Yeah, presenteeism. It’s the opposite of absenteeism. So, rather than missing a bunch of 
work, you’re just – you go in when you shouldn’t. So –  
 
LG: 
Do you think that affects people’s thinking in any kind of way? 
 
BW: 
Yeah; I think there’s sort of this obligation to the team, and sort of like a notion like, if 
you don’t show up, you’re weak. So, you know, people talk about weakness all the time. 
So, if someone does a really good job what you tell them isn’t, “Awesome job,” it’s, 
“strong work.”  
 
 
So, you know, or if a resident isn’t a good resident, you call him a weak resident. And 
you know, like when you’re coming onto a service that you don’t know, you know, you 
ask the senior residents, “Well who do I,” you know, (when I was a fellow) I’d be like, 
“Well who’s the weak residents? Who do I need to worry about?” And that’s how you 
would talk about it. 
 
LG: 
It sounds a little bit like kind of a culture of masculinity. 
 
BW: 
It’s just sort of a hyper-masculine – you know, even though like my residency class was 
more than 50% women, there was a lot of that like talking about like whose dick was 
bigger and stuff. And the women would talk about it. It was really weird. [Laughs] 
 
[26:54] 
 
LG: 
Can you talk a little bit about your current job? 
 
BW: 
Yeah. So, I do addiction medicine now – it’s substantially different than where I trained. 
Mostly what I do is talk to people. And so, it’s people with substance use disorder, you 
know: heroin addiction, alcoholism, porn addiction, food addiction – that kind of stuff.  
 
Physician Oral History: Bill Walsh  
Page 12 
 
 
And so, it’s mostly sort of a) peering out why they wound up being addicts, and then 
providing medications to support them that keep them from relapsing or dying – is the 
main goal: don’t let them die.  
 
 
And then getting them appropriate therapy. And then connections to mutual aid, or 
community support groups, like AA, NA, Refuge Recovery, Dharma Recovery – that 
kind of stuff.  
 
 
So, the patients are – a lot of the patients come in knowing they’ve got problems, but they 
don’t want to fully admit they have that problem, or that something that’s really just a 
symptom is the whole thing – and if they get rid of that symptom (like taking heroin) then 
they’re fine, and don’t need to do anything else.  
 
 
So, you know – there’s a lot of just kind of getting them to see the nature of their issue, 
and then get them the resources they need to get well. So, but that’s what that is.  
 
LG: 
You hear a lot about the phrase “being responsible” for a patient –  
 
BW: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
What does that mean? 
 
BW: 
So, you know, I talk about ownership too – it’s like you own that patient. So, anyone who 
is your patient, you have a certain level of responsibility for making sure that they’re at 
the correct set of diagnoses, that you have aimed them at resources appropriately, that 
you’ve explained it in a way that they can understand what they need to do to get well.  
 
 
You know, like if someone kills themselves, they you know, legally you have some 
responsibility to answer for that: like did you do due diligence? Did you ask those 
questions? Did you make sure that if they were expressing suicidal intent that you did 
planning with them to kind of make sure they didn’t take any action to harm themselves?  
 
 
Like you know, making sure all of the guns are out of the house. Or making sure that, 
you know – especially in this gun-crazy Utah; like it’s so hard to get people to get guns 
out of their house. They’re like, “Oh. Did you tell the police to get the guns out of my 
house?” I’m like, “Yeah.” [Laughs]  
 
 
So, that’s good – yay. So, in that way you’re responsible for a patient.  
 
[30:03] 
 
 
There’s a sense of ownership though too, when people talk about, you know – like if you 
do something with a patient, you kind of own that treatment. Like, “I am responsible for 
it.” But there’s a sense of personal, you know – like people talk about, “That’s my 
patient, so don’t like do stuff with them.” [Laughs] 
 
Physician Oral History: Bill Walsh  
Page 13 
 
 
So, you know, sometimes if you send someone to another physician, it’s with a particular 
question in mind and you don’t want them sort of running everything else, because you 
know, they may not follow the goal.  
 
 
For example, so my patients see (because of finance reasons) psychiatric APRNs for 
medical management of some of their psychiatric illnesses. And almost always they get 
put on a bunch of sedating medications because they express anxiety. So, they give them 
Xanax, and other stuff – even though they tell the nurse that they’ve got addiction. So, 
there’s this sort of missed gap – and that drives me crazy. 
 
[Soft laughter] 
 
 
So, but that’s you know, and so sometimes then you would call that person and be like, 
“Hey, you know they have addiction, right?” 
 
 
“Oh.” 
 
 
“So, please stop giving,” –  
 
LG: 
So, ownership in the sense that you’re guiding their care. 
 
BW: 
Well I mean, like the idea – the old-fashioned idea was that you – like the old paternalism 
idea was that you actually had like, they were yours. Especially within the hospital – you 
are really responsible, fully responsible, for everything that happens to that patient.  
 
 
Under the modern paradigm, like patients can refuse stuff (which is good), so there’s less 
of a sense of that. But the culture still carries forward that old idea of ownership in the 
same way that it was.  
 
 
So, even the patients can refuse treatments, or you know, there’s multi-disciplines – and 
nursing has more autonomy than they used to – there’s still that sense of, “I’m 
responsible for everything that happens.” 
 
[32:15] 
 
LG: 
That sounds difficult. 
 
BW: 
Yeah, it’s emotionally difficult. 
 
LG: 
Can you talk about that? 
 
BW: 
I mean, it’s just exhausting. So, you know, I mean like you’ll have – so, when I did ICU 
stuff, like I would come home, and you know, try to be sleeping. And like I’d, you know, 
I’d sleep for a couple of hours, then I’d wake up and I’d go check on stuff on the 
computers and call the unit to sort of see what was happening. And I would just go back 
because I couldn’t stand it. [Laughs] 
Physician Oral History: Bill Walsh  
Page 14 
 
 
LG: 
Because you were worried that something would happen? 
 
BW: 
I was worried that something was going to go wrong. Like especially if there was a 
resident on that wasn’t particularly sharp, or attentive, or just wasn’t really interested in 
intensive care medicine, or had something personal going on (which you don’t always 
know), but you know, they just seem really distracted.  
 
 
So, there’s no – people can die in like 15 minutes if you miss stuff. So, I would sort of get 
up – I knew labs were coming in at two, I’d get up at 1:45 and go check labs. Because I 
had ordered them for them, and if things were awry sometimes I’d just put my shoes on 
and go to work [laughs]. 
 
LG: 
And what happens if you make a mistake? 
 
BW: 
So, one patient we had who died – I don’t know that there’s –  
 
 
Well, there wasn’t really error, but the procedure did not go as planned. The patient had 
abhorrent anatomy, and there was an artery where it usually isn’t, and we put a needle 
through it and he hemorrhaged to death – not because we missed it, but because his 
tissues wouldn’t hold together. So, we tried to sew the artery together, and the surgeon 
tried to sew it together; and he just fell apart and he bled to death.  
 
 
So that family called the resident that did the procedure a murderer, and called me a 
murderer. And you know, it’s just hard to hear. I mean, when a patient dies anyway, it’s 
pretty hard, especially if they’re youngish (this guy wasn’t; he was in his 60s).  
 
 
But you know, it’s just hard to take. So, when you hear that, and there’s sort of this anger 
directed at you – there’s just not a lot of resources to manage that in the hospital, and –  
 
[34:43] 
 
LG: 
For the physicians? 
 
BW: 
For the physicians. I don’t really think for the nurses either, honestly; I think for nobody. 
It’s just not oriented that way. 
 
LG: 
And how do people deal with it? 
 
BW: 
Well you know, some people burn out and quit. There was a guy my intern year who just 
snapped. He was found wandering around in the parking lot talking to himself. And they 
tried to get him through the intern year – actually, he did get through intern year just 
doing outpatient. And then he (in the second year) he just quit one day: he just left work 
and never went back.  
 
Physician Oral History: Bill Walsh  
Page 15 
 
 
There was a guy that when I was a second-year fellow, who overdosed and died. And 
some people use drugs, some people use sex; people drink. A lot of people (out here) will 
like excessively exercise – which sounds healthy [laughs], but it isn’t. People get hurt 
repeatedly, just for different – it’s another healthy-looking response that isn’t healthy. Or 
they just will throw themselves into work. Divorce rate is pretty high.  
 
 
I think my class of fellowship was the first year that there wasn’t a divorce in 20 years. 
So –  
 
LG: 
How many of them were married? 
 
BW: 
All of us were married.  
 
LG: 
Oh – four. 
 
BW: 
Four, yeah; all four were married. [Laughs] 
 
LG: 
How has being a doctor changed you as a person? 
 
BW: 
Oof; it’s hard to say because you know, I was 30 when I started med school and now I’m 
50. So, I mean, like people change anyway. 
 
 
I’m both more and less sympathetic, meaning like I’m able to see people’s struggles a 
little bit more clearly, I have a broader perspective on the level of suffering in humanity. I 
mean, you really get a sense – people tell you all kinds of stuff. I mean, like people tell 
you stuff and you’re like, “Whoa; I didn’t expect you to tell me that.”  
 
 
I need to hear it for my work, and I’m glad that they do, and I’m grateful for the 
confidence that people give you; but you know, sometimes you have to hear really hard 
things. Like men who are beating their wives; or women that were repeatedly raped.  
 
 
And you know, I have patients that – I have to sort of conflate stories, because I can’t 
share individual stories, because it’s not permitted. But sort of, patients that are female 
and homeless, and are essentially trading sex – you know, they’re doing sex work to get 
housing, or medications, or for their doctor’s visits. 
 
[37:42] 
 
 
So, you know – so, I’m both more sympathetic and less sympathetic to people. And you 
know, like I have a lot of more resources to sort of deal with my own emotional problems 
from work now, and I don’t do intensive care anymore – although, I miss that sort of 
physiology, and all the craziness – you know, it just isn’t – it’s not sustainable 
(emotionally).  
 
 
So, I don’t know. I mean, that (I guess) not a very good description of how I’ve changed, 
but [laughs] –  
Physician Oral History: Bill Walsh  
Page 16 
 
 
LG: 
Oh, it’s a hard question – [inaudible] 
 
BW: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
There’s a lot in the literature right now on resiliency –  
 
BW: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
For physicians –  
 
BW: 
And burnout, yeah. 
 
LG: 
And burnout; can you talk about that a little bit? What does that mean? 
 
BW: 
Yeah. So, burnout is a nice word for physician abuse. So, I don’t dither around that. The 
system is not set up for sustainability. The way it was designed was sort of – when people 
would spend two or three minutes writing notes at the end of rounds, and just mostly for 
communication with each other, or reminders to themselves of what I’m supposed to do.  
 
 
And now, like you spend all this time doing documentation, and it takes away from both 
like family life and patient care. So, you get burned out on that, and pissed off. And you 
know, like there’s just not – people talk about resiliency, like there are some sort of tricks 
to introduce to that system, that are going to make doctors more productive (which is 
what they really want). 
 
LG: 
Um-hm. 
 
BW: 
So, that’s my little leftist take on that. 
 
 
But I think it is important to provide resources to nurses, physicians, and anyone else in 
the system (respiratory therapists, pharmacists) to sort of handle the stuff we see and do, 
and do wrong, or miss. And there just isn’t. 
 
[40:09] 
 
 
You know, they have EAPs and stuff, but they are awful. 
 
LG: 
What’s an EAP? 
 
BW: 
Employee Assistance Programs. 
 
LG: 
Oh. 
 
Physician Oral History: Bill Walsh  
Page 17 
 
BW: 
So, like out here – the big systems are the University of Utah and Intermountain 
Healthcare. And both of them have EAP programs, and I treat people who are within both 
systems (or who have left those systems). And they are awful.  
 
 
I mean, not that the individuals in them are bad people, but they don’t have the training to 
deal with those issues. Yeah, I think what they’re trained to do is sort of normal like 
workplace stuff, like sexual harassment, or like disagreements with that, or minor 
depression.  
 
 
And you know, when you see some guy blow his face off, you know – I had some patient 
blew his face off with a shotgun, like at his chin. And you know, I had to get a breathing 
tube through that mess, into his airway while he was busy drowning in blood, and his 
brains are hanging out. It’s not a normal thing. 
 
 
So, you know, and the EAP folks are sort of masters’ level trainees, who have mostly just 
finished school and are trying to get hours in so they can get a job where they make a 
little bit more money. And again, not bad people, but just not adequately prepared for 
talking to people about the stuff they see. And I don’t know. 
 
 
I mean, there is sort of this – right, there is you know, the well-advertised stigma on 
mental illness and medicine, and addiction and medicine. And you know, I’ve been in 
recovery for 29 years (since I’ve had a drink). But see – coming from that perspective, 
practicing medicine, even like within our ranks: like talking about the patients, it’s sort 
of, you know, a lot of ignorance about what that actually is and what depression actually 
is.  
 
 
In that sort of weakness-strength paradigm, it’s sort of seen as weakness to have a mental 
illness. And the main thing you don’t want to be is the weak link, because then it over-
burdens the other workers in the system.  
 
LG: 
Would you say that medical training and education is (or can be) traumatizing? 
 
BW: 
Yeah, I think it is. I mean, I think everyone who goes through it has this certain level of 
trauma – just because it’s a pressure cooker designed to weed out weakness. I mean, what 
you want is smart, hardworking doctors. And the way they sorted that out in the olden 
days was that people would literally be weeded out.  
 
[42:54] 
 
 
So, my dad started med school – the talk the first day of med school was, “Look to your 
right, look to your left; one of you won’t be here in four years.” So, meaning one in three 
people dropped out, and that was normal and expected. 
 
 
And then residency training used to be a pyramid system, where every year certain 
numbers of people weren’t renewed. So, you know, the chief resident would be the 
person who survived the, you know, the culling [laughs], essentially.  
Physician Oral History: Bill Walsh  
Page 18 
 
 
 
And that doesn’t really happen anymore; like they don’t cull people out – they actually 
try and (somewhat) support people through. But the system is still the same, and so 
everyone is kind of getting this crushing emotional and work pressure, and there’s not 
any outlets for that (beyond like ‘figure it out, kid’, or you know, go for a run, or maybe 
take a few days off, or something; you know, have a fun vacation). 
 
 
And there’s not much time off. I mean, our program only had two years off intern year, 
and then three the rest of the time. 
 
LG: 
Two years? 
 
BW: 
The first year, two weeks off.  
 
LG: 
Oh.  
 
BW: 
Sorry; did I say two years? 
 
LG: 
Yeah. 
 
BW: 
Oh, oops. 
 
 
Yeah, so two weeks off a year, the first year; then three weeks off the second – well, the 
last five years of training.  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
BW: 
So, it’s just not much vacation time. And sometimes when people take it, like the other 
parts of the service get mad. So, like in fellowship, you basically had to take your 
vacation during your research time, which was you know, also important if you wanted to 
advance your career as an academic.  
 
 
I mean, you know – so, it’s just a weird system. And it kind of produces people that sort 
of view work as sort of being the thing you should be doing, always. 
 
LG: 
All the time? 
 
BW: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
Well let’s turn to the topic of humor then. 
 
[44:56] 
 
BW: 
[Laughs]  
 
Physician Oral History: Bill Walsh  
Page 19 
 
LG: 
Doctors are pretty well-known for their sense of humor; and some people might even say 
that this is a stereotype of the profession. 
 
BW: 
Um-hmm. 
 
LG: 
Why do you think that is? 
 
BW: 
Can you repeat the question? 
 
LG: 
Just doctors are known for their sense of humor, and some people even say that it’s sort 
of stereotyped –  
 
BW: 
Oh.  
 
LG: 
Like that – why is that? 
 
BW: 
I don’t know. I mean, I guess because one of the ways of coping with (or dealing with, I 
don’t know if it’s coping, it’s just dealing with it) is joking and joking around.  
 
 
I mean, one way residency was explained to me was sort of like extended day camp. 
Because you’re constantly with a bunch of people that you see all the time, and you have 
sleepovers, but you’re at work. And so, it just gets to be this sort of chummy, joking 
environment. And you know, people will pull pranks and sort of, you know, one up each 
other with humorous stuff.  
 
 
And then you know, like you just see the worst in people, for sure [laughs]. You know, 
when someone hasn’t slept or eaten for 30 hours (or washed) – people get cranky. And 
so, you know, telling jokes helps like diffuse the situation.  
 
 
And things also, on rounds, can get tense because if someone made a mistake – like one 
that actually wasn’t just like, “oops,” it was, “oh my god,” mistake – you need to kind of 
like finish the day. So, humor helps with that. 
 
 
So, sometimes jokes, sometimes like, laughing about stuff. But it just – I think it’s 
helpful. 
 
LG: 
Do people actually pull pranks? 
 
BW: 
Yeah. I mean, there was one – people you don’t like – so you would short-sheet their call 
bed (especially people who really slept a lot), you know, like on call – you’d go short-
sheet their bed. Or like –  
 
[47:04] 
 
LG: 
Did you ever do that? 
 
Physician Oral History: Bill Walsh  
Page 20 
 
BW: 
I did not. 
 
[Laughter] 
 
LG: 
But you knew someone? 
 
BW: 
I encouraged other people to do it, and I showed them how to short-sheet a bed (because 
they did not know). 
 
[Soft laughter] 
 
LG: 
When did you first notice humor being used? 
 
BW: 
I think probably – I guess at the beginning of third year, there was –  
 
LG: 
Third year of residency? 
 
BW: 
Third year of medical school. 
 
LG: 
Or medical school? 
 
BW: 
There was – one of the interns, she was just finishing up her internship in OB/GYN. 
Because I had started early, because I had gotten – I was doing some stuff with the AMA 
where I was running for office – I can’t remember what the heck I was doing at that 
point, honestly; something. I don’t even remember, honestly. 
 
 
So, I was going for a week to that. So, I came in a week early and was the only student on 
service. And you know, the interns were just joking, it was OB/GYNs – the nurses were 
just joking about, and the residents were just joking – it was all women.  
 
 
They just had like all these vagina jokes, and were like eating breakfast (which hardly 
ever happened), because it was a quiet morning. And they were like loudly talking about 
vaginas in the cafeteria because like it just made everyone else really uncomfortable –  
 
LG: 
[Laughs] 
 
BW: 
All the regular people who were there. And it was legitimate work talk [laughs]. But like 
you know, like vaginal lesions, and you know, the surgery they were going to do – they 
were being as loud as possible about the word “vagina.” 
 
LG: 
[Laughs] 
 
BW: 
Yeah, because that’s, it was just – they thought that was hysterical. So, I was like, “Oh. 
Okay.”  
 
[Laughter] 
Physician Oral History: Bill Walsh  
Page 21 
 
 
LG: 
Do you have any examples of humor from gross anatomy? 
 
BW: 
Oh – they’re so inappropriate.  
 
[49:05] 
 
 
Yeah, there was one group of people that really – so, in order to keep – IU’s anatomy lab 
was a year, right? (On our campus; other campuses did it differently.) But so, August to 
May. So, that means that your cadaver like had to be intact and well cared for, for a year, 
or it would, you know, dry up or decay – it’s gross.  
 
 
So, there was one group that really just did not take care of their cadaver. And [laughs] it 
got all black – like it just turned black, and shriveled and gross. And so, people started 
like putting other organs in it (from other cadavers) to show them like – switching the 
liver out, for example. 
 
LG: 
Because their liver wasn’t good anymore? 
 
BW: 
Because their liver was like – you know, the liver is the size of like a football (sort of), a 
little bit bigger (just depends on the body size, obviously). Theirs had shrunk to the size 
of like a fist; and like they put the liver where the heart was, and just move it around, 
because –  
 
LG: 
In order to mess with them? 
 
BW: 
Yeah, just to see – they just didn’t come to lab. They weren’t doing patient stuff – like 
they were all going to do other specialties that didn’t involve touching people, or needing 
to know where things were in the body, necessarily. So, they just didn’t [laughs] come to 
lab very much. So, that was the thing. 
 
 
I don’t know. I mean, you know, sometimes you would like dissect something on 
someone else’s cadaver – this is super nerdy – but like if it had been improperly dissected 
and they had identified the wrong thing as some kind of feature [laughs] – we’d go over 
and re-dissect it. So, during the exam like the thing was actually there, and the students 
who had that cadaver were like – thought that the thing was lost and couldn’t identify –  
 
LG: 
Because they misidentified it in the first place? 
 
BW: 
Because they had misidentified it in the first place, and we didn’t want, on the exam, to 
have a pin in some nerve that wasn’t the nerve, you know. You know, one was the 
recurrent laryngeal nerve, which is in the throat – they had misidentified it. And so, I was 
like, “Oh, my god. That was the one,” you know – they’d had had some other nerve (I 
can’t remember) identified as that. So, we went and re-dissected it and – I don’t know; 
it’s super nerd humor, basically. 
 
Physician Oral History: Bill Walsh  
Page 22 
 
[Laughter] 
 
[51:34] 
 
 
It was funny to us. 
 
LG: 
That’s fine; that’s fine. 
 
BW: 
At the time. 
 
LG: 
Any other –  
 
BW: 
I guess the other thing was that like, you know, like when you’re hydrating the body, 
you’d use, you know, a preservative to kind of hydrate the body, and so it would collect 
in the abdomen – and so, we were trying to figure out a way of draining that fluid off 
[laughs]. So, you know, we just made all kinds of gross jokes about that. I don’t know. 
 
LG: 
That’s just fine. 
 
 
What about – talk about the use of humor in residency? 
 
BW: 
Some of it would be about like weird disease stuff you’d see. Sometimes it was with 
nurses. I don’t know – we had this patient who was – he was mentally ill, and super sick, 
and because of his disease he’d developed an enormous scrotum (like the size of three 
basketballs) – I mean, it was really big. It wasn’t just like, “Oh, that’s big.” And we had 
to develop, like come up (with urology) some sling for that.  
 
 
And then like – so, after the patient went home, like they kept the room that way, and like 
would put things in it (the sling) [dog barks loudly]. 
 
[Laughter] 
 
 
So, we’d have like a fake patient, and we’d like have some med student go in there. And 
we’re like, “oh, my!” [Laughing] 
 
 
So, you know; stuff like that. 
 
 
And it was a scrotal sling, is what –  
 
LG: 
The title of the –  
 
BW: 
The thing was; but like there wasn’t that guy’s poor scrotum in there anymore. 
 
LG: 
[Laughs] 
 
BW: 
So, anyway; stuff like that would be a thing you do. 
Physician Oral History: Bill Walsh  
Page 23 
 
 
 
Or you’d tell – people would sometimes tell like formal jokes on rounds – if things were 
really grim. Like there was a morning – like we just like, a morning of death. We had like 
some grandma come in (who was like 92), die. And then like some 19-year-old 
motorcycle accident, had the top of his head sheared off, die.  
 
 
And it was – it was just like that: boom, boom, boom, boom, boom – like in an hour. And 
one of our residents was like crying; so, you know, we just told jokes.  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. Formal jokes? Like –  
 
[53:50] 
 
BW: 
That’s where I told the joke about them – the stroke thing – [laughs] 
 
LG: 
I’ve got that one on tape, so –  
 
BW: 
Oh, I know, but –  
 
[Laughter] 
 
 
It’s just – I mean, it was a good joke to break the tension up, because like you know, 
there’s stuff worse than death. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
BW: 
So –  
 
LG: 
How do you think doctors view death? 
 
BW: 
Well it’s variable. So, like you know, like some people hardly ever see any of their 
patients die. You know, like OB/GYNs – that’s not, well: depending. So, like regular 
OB/GYN doesn’t do like maternal fetal medicine, or high-risk OB, you know, or 
pediatricians – they don’t usually see their patients die, and they sort of see death as this 
thing to be avoided, and sort of terrible.  
 
 
And you know, I think one in five of my patients died at the ICU. With addiction, I 
probably lose maybe three patients a year, maybe four. And I think most people have this 
view that’s this thing to be, you know, delayed, or avoided, or stemmed off as sort of a 
primary partner job. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
BW: 
And so, I think that’s probably how most people see it. And when you do ICU work, you 
know, there’s so much death that, you know – I told you this before – like at the end of 
every life, everyone dies.  
Physician Oral History: Bill Walsh  
Page 24 
 
 
 
And so, it’s a question of how – when someone is going to die, it’s coming; you know, 
how you handle that as a professional, how you help other people handle that is 
important.  
 
 
And I think if you take that step back and see it as inevitable, like this is going to happen 
to everybody, and how are we going to get someone there in the way that they would best 
want? Is kind of how I, through training, got that reframed for me – both by experience 
and then sort of, you know, working with palliative care groups, and trying to get them 
up to speed [laughs], then vice versa.  
 
[56:17] 
 
 
So, there’s some conflict between palliative care and critical care a lot, which is sort of 
obvious, but anyway. So, it’s hard to know how everyone views it, but it’s sort of –  
 
LG: 
Did you ever feel like you had somehow failed if a patient died? 
 
BW: 
Mostly not; I mean, honestly – most of the time when people died, it was because they’d 
got some incurable or untreatable disease that we either don’t have the technology to do, 
or was too far along by the time we got over to them. 
 
 
A couple of times we missed a diagnosis, I mean there was a guy that came in with 
pneumonia, and chest pain, and other stuff. And had you know, silent (or non-painful) 
aortic dissection, which is pretty rare; and that’s what he died from. So, I kind of felt like 
I missed the boat there. I mean, given the extent of the dissection, he probably would 
have died anyway; but it would have been nice to not miss that. 
 
[Dog barking] 
 
[Recording stops/starts] 
 
[57:28] 
 
LG: 
Okay, we were talking about dying. But obviously it’s a fact that people die. 
 
BW: 
Um-hmm. 
 
LG: 
Did this ever make your job feel futile, or hopeless in any kind of way? 
 
BW: 
I think – so, in critical care, the question – I think people (in regular life) think that 
there’s a real notion of medical futility: like we have some agreed-upon definition. But 
there isn’t. So, what might seem futile to like regular people – so, if there’s like a 5% 
chance of someone surviving, is that futile? Is it futile if it’s 1%?

So, I think if we gave a good effort, I mean, you know, had the correct diagnosis (or at 
least close enough), and you did the right stuff – I didn’t usually feel like my efforts were 
wasted. Sometimes I think we were wasting money. But yeah – I didn’t feel like we were 
just wasting time and effort, honestly.  
 
 
Sometimes – like I guess the stuff where we felt like (and partially why, after sort of 
reframing my career, I did do addiction medicine – although, that’s not something I need 
to go into) – was, yeah, how do we keep –  
 
 
The folks that kept coming in were alcoholics, and people with overdoses, and they 
would just come in over, and over, and over with you know, like ten overdoses in a year; 
or you know, we’d see the same guy drink so much that he didn’t wake up for five days 
and then had delirium tremens for two weeks. Then they’d be back.  
 
 
And you know, it just seemed like the system was missing that – or, we’d send 
somebody: we’d do a lot of hard work, get somebody well, and then send them out to the 
floor team. And they would miss them and they’d be back. So, that felt frustrating.  
 
[59:51] 
 
 
But mostly, I would get annoyed with other people, honestly [laughs]. 
 
LG: 
Other people, being? 
 
BW: 
Like other doctors, or nurses, or as a patient – like for screwing things up: “I did all this 
work, and you screwed it up.” [Laughs] 
 
LG: 
Did you ever make jokes about other doctors? 
 
BW: 
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. 
 
LG: 
Can you talk about that? 
 
BW: 
(It always seems mean.) So, let me, I’m going to reframe this. Some of the smartest 
doctors are orthopedic surgeons, I mean, so – but we talk about them being dumb all the 
time because I think they’re deliberately that way. So, a lot of the “smart” jokes are 
(smart-dumb jokes) are about orthopedic surgeons.  
 
 
So, there is all the “where can you hide a dollar from?” jokes, you know. You know, 
“Where can you hide a dollar from an orthopedic surgeon?”  
 
 
“You put it on the patient.” Actually, no – that’s –  
 
LG: 
Radiology? 
 
Physician Oral History: Bill Walsh  
Page 26 
 
BW: 
Yeah, that’s radiology. For orthopedic surgeon, you put it in the chart, or in a book – like 
you know, because they don’t really read, they just sort of do stuff. 
 
 
You know, for a general surgeon the joke was, “You can’t hide a dollar from a general 
surgeon.” For an internist, it was – internists don’t like to do GYN or rectal exams – you 
stick it in their butt.  
 
LG: 
[Laughs] 
 
BW: 
So, the weird thing was – when we were in the ICU, and we started talking, you know, 
we were talking about doctor humor, I could not find jokes about intensivists; and I still 
have never heard a joke about intensivists – I think it’s because we’re not funny [laughs]. 
Like I don’t know, like you know, I think we’re all Asperger-y, and you know, intense.  
 
 
But it’s not like – my friend, Robert Simpson and I were just actively trying to find jokes 
about intensivists at one point; and we could not get anyone to come up with one. And 
he’d Google on the internet – there’s no jokes about us. [Laughs] 
 
LG: 
Would people ever joke about the body? 
 
[1:02:04] 
 
BW: 
Yeah; I mean, you talk about your own bodies, you talk about patients’ bodies – because 
sometimes things were like weird. I mean, you’ve got somebody like with an open – 
come in with an open chest cavity. Sometimes it’s just like amazement: how is this guy 
alive? Like his lungs are shriveled up and dried; like how is this happening? Or, you 
know, just people with really big members, the nurses would be like, “Well!”  
 
[Laughter] 
 
 
“If this guy recovers, I’m going to ask him out.” They wouldn’t actually do that, but like 
that was the joke; that’s how you knew like, “Well someone’s got – is well-endowed.” 
 
 
So, that sort of thing would be there. Or you know, I had a patient who was morbidly 
obese, and like we were trying to like figure out where you could put a central line 
(because she was dehydrated and needed antibiotics), and it was a disaster.  
 
 
Like we found a mouse in her armpit, and a candy bar, and part of a sandwich, and stuff 
like that. So, that was sort of – and we didn’t necessarily joke about her – like the 
astonishment of like how bad things had gotten was a source of humor for years [laugh]. 
It was just like, “Wow! That was something.”  
 
 
And people just sort of – like the odd things people do to their bodies: medicines – well, 
folk medicines that people take, like the black cohosh here, like is the thing in Utah. And 
people will swear by it, and you know, it will erode your neck if you put it on your neck. 
So, a gal that came in had a fist-sized hole in her neck, no skin, could see all the anatomy; 
Physician Oral History: Bill Walsh  
Page 27 
 
but you know, that was sort of funny, and sort of not funny. Mostly, as a teaching point 
for the house staff about how to talk to people about like what are they really doing when 
you leave my clinic? 
 
[1:04:08] 
 
LG: 
What about jokes about death? 
 
BW: 
There’s a lot of jokes about death. I mean, you know, like patients die and be like, well – 
and that varied by hospital, so like in Utah people will talk about “celestial discharges,” 
because a lot of the people here are very religious, especially the nurses. At IU, we talked 
about “discharge to the basement” or you know, “the BU” (basement unit) –  
 
LG: 
[Laughs] 
 
BW: 
Which was the morgue. 
 
 
You know there’s a morgue rescue, you know, the morgue came and saved them from us, 
you know –  
 
[Laughter] 
 
 
That way you can’t poke any more holes in their body, you know? Some patients might 
be there for months; I mean, someone would get a terrible flu, and their lungs would turn 
into (basically) rocks. So, they couldn’t get off the ventilator, and you know, their brain 
had been injured from low oxygen tension, so they weren’t going to wake up.  
 
 
And the family didn’t want to give up; so, we can do a lot of things to keep them alive for 
a long time, and you know, we’d talk about the morgue rescuing them: rescuing that 
patient from us so we can’t put any more tubes or holes into their body or poke them 
anymore. 
 
LG: 
So, why do you think this kind of humor exists? 
 
BW: 
I think it’s because you have a unique relationship with people’s bodies: a) I mean, you 
see a lot of naked people (not that it’s sexual), but it just, you know, in normal life 
everyone wears clothes, and you know what I’m talking about? Bodily functions, it’s not 
appropriate, or it seemed to be inappropriate in modern life.  
 
 
And people don’t talk about or think about death, like ever, I think. Like they do as much 
as they could to avoid it; I mean, we’ve got family members that when we’ve brought up 
death, they have a conniption.  
 
[1:06:12] 
 
Physician Oral History: Bill Walsh  
Page 28 
 
 
Like so, you know, it just sort of – because it’s a unique relationship, when you go home, 
you can’t really talk about that stuff, because people would just – a) sometimes it’s not 
appropriate, because you can’t talk about patients in that way, because it’s confidential; 
and b) they just wouldn’t understand.  
 
 
There’s just not like – you know, you just can’t talk about like having to like hold 
someone’s head down to put a line in, because if you give them a sedating medication 
they’ll die, but they need that line for dialysis, so you’ve got to put it in. And they’re 
delirious, so they think you’re trying to kill them while you stick this giant catheter in 
their neck. 
 
LG: 
That sounds horrible. 
 
BW: 
So, you just don’t go home and talk about that; so, you joke about it at work. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
BW: 
[Laughs] I mean, that was a thing I had to do to some poor kid – well he wasn’t a kid, he 
was in his 20s, but he seemed like a kid to me. 
 
 
So, you know, that’s not normal conversation stuff. So, you tell work jokes, and that’s 
how it goes.  
 
LG: 
Do you feel like doctors suffer as a result of their work? 
 
BW: 
It’s hard – the people it attracts are mostly smart, hardworking people, right? Generally. 
And are a little reticent to talk about emotions, or lots of folk would say are emotionally 
stunted anyway, because we spent all our time doing schoolwork [laughs]. 
 
 
But I think most physicians suffer some, and it either comes out as about bitterness about 
the system, or bitterness about patients, or sort of, you know, BS about burnout. And you 
know, they do surveys, and I think it’s like two-thirds of physicians feel like they’re 
burned out; so, that’s a lot. And I think it’s probably the other third either figured 
something out, or they do derm or something: work eight to three and rake it in. [Laughs] 
 
LG: 
I tend to think burnout is a euphemism for suffering. 
 
BW: 
No, I think it’s a euphemism for burnout and abuse, you know. So, I think almost all 
house staff (almost all residents) have a fair level of suffering and trauma, unless they are 
doing something super cushy. I mean, there’s a guy I work with, and who’s sober, and 
he’s not in the state; but he you know, I was just sort of talking to him somewhat 
regularly about his training, and he’s been sober a long time, like you know. And he just 
really struggles.  
 
 
And he hadn’t thought about a drink in ten years before he started residency. And then he 
went through med school, and finished college, and all this stuff, and did fine. But like in 
Physician Oral History: Bill Walsh  
Page 29 
 
the middle of intern year, he was like, “Yeah, I can’t take care of myself, and I can’t do, 
I’m not getting to meetings.” And he feels like I can’t talk about this stuff with the fellow 
residents there. And finally I found him a sober physician who is actually in his hospital, 
that he could talk to.  
 
[1:09:45] 
 
 
But that was it; like he just didn’t have anywhere else he could kind of deal with that. 
And I think that’s pretty normal. And so, if you’ve got some kind of other issue going on, 
it really stresses you; because it’s super stressful.  
 
 
And this is a well put together guy: he’s super smart, he’s in a really competitive 
program, in a competitive field. And just you know, and he’s married to a physician, so 
he can talk about this stuff, it’s not like she doesn’t understand. But he just can’t – it’s 
just too much. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
BW: 
So, you know – I don’t know; I mean, that’s – it’s a broad generalization to say that 
everyone suffers –  
 
LG: 
Of course. 
 
BW: 
But you know, I think it’s a universal condition in the profession. And we have no real, 
good way of dealing with it.  
 
LG: 
Okay, well I know you have to go, so I’m going to wrap up. But is there anything else 
that you would like people to know about being a doctor? 
 
BW: 
I still think it’s rewarding. Like [laughing] I have all this stuff to say. 
 
 
But you know, when you see people come in, and they’re really just struggling; and then 
you keep at them for a while, and then they turn it around; or when I was in the ICU, and 
people would make it through – it’s just tremendously rewarding to have been of service 
to somebody.  
 
 
So, you know, it’s hard work, it’s difficult work, it’s difficult, emotional work. And you 
know, I’m still glad I did it; I don’t –  
 
 
You know, there’s always the like – you know, it’s just sort of like the hazed person, 
“Oh, yeah I made it through; therefore, it’s good. I’m glad I did it.” You know, I worked 
pretty hard during training to reform training. And then I took abuse for that. But I am 
glad that I did that. 
 
LG: 
Do you have time to talk about that a little bit? 
 
Physician Oral History: Bill Walsh  
Page 30 
 
BW: 
Oh, yeah. I was on the accrediting board – the ACGME is the professional accrediting 
board for allopathic physicians (MDs) in residency training: so, accrediting all graduate 
medical education programs.  
 
 
And while I was a fellow I was on the board of that organization, and we made a first 
pass (or second pass, really) at reforming duty hours based on sort of physiologic 
parameters. So, we tried to look at the research around sleep and learning, and come up 
with a reasonable alternative.  
 
 
Everyone pretty much hated our [laughing] thing. We got a lot of flak; I lost a lot of 
friends, and I got a lot of personal verbal and email abuse. 
 
LG: 
What was it you were trying to do? 
 
[1:12:47] 
 
BW: 
So, basically try and make residency training conditions better. So, both better for 
education, and so that you know, residents don’t get so tired that they get in the car and 
drive home and crash into a wall and die. So, you know –  
 
LG: 
[Sneezes] 
 
BW: 
Pretty minimal reforms. 
 
LG: 
[Sneezes] 
 
BW: 
But people didn’t make an effort to sort of understand what we were doing, or read 
anything we wrote about it, and just sort of reacted to the numbers that we put out, which 
is sort of getting rid of the 30-hour call thing: just making it 24 hours (which still, most 
people think that’s insane). And then a few hours to wrap up, so it was 26 hours, really. 
 
 
And you know, a few suggestions about having places for people to sleep, to take naps. 
And educating people about sleep hygiene and that sort of stuff. And so, that was in 
2011. It was pretty – 2010 –  
 
 
Yeah, I actually (deliberately), we went rafting that week – like we scheduled it so I 
wouldn’t have to be around for the press and people’s reaction when the hours rolled out. 
 
LG: 
And what were the final numbers? 
 
BW: 
Basically, its still 80 hours a week (and they’ve since been revised), but no more than a 
24-hour shift plus two hours to wrap up work. And you know, more vacation, paternity 
leave, maternity leave, that sort of stuff.  
 
 
People went bananas. I mean, it was really very controversial. And I was told that I had 
betrayed the profession – both for not over-restricting (like restricting it more), and for 
Physician Oral History: Bill Walsh  
Page 31 
 
restricting it – like people were mad that we didn’t get rid of 24-hour shifts and go to 16 
hours.  
 
[1:14:42] 
 
 
People were mad that we went away from 30 hours and they wanted to go back to 36 
hours (which is what my dad did). So, great. 
 
LG: 
[Laughs] 
 
BW: 
So, but you know, going home at noon after being up all night is just crazy; and you’re 
totally ineffective, you didn’t learn anything. And I think the sleep research helped us 
out.  
 
 
But it was not a fun time. So, anyway. 
 
LG: 
Is there anything else you want – you think is important for people to know about being a 
doctor? 
 
BW: 
I don’t know. I think it’s hard to be in like regular relationships and be married. You 
know, like have relationships with your kids – it just is so consuming as a profession; and 
the expectation is that you’ll devote all your time to it.  
 
 
So, you know, and then if you don’t want to do that, you’re seen as sort of like not caring 
about your patients. And so, it’s just difficult to not let it consume your whole life, and 
have some sort of room for personal (some kind of personal) something. Anything. 
 
[Laughter] 
 
LG: 
Okay. Well thank you very much.  
 
 
Again, this is –  
 
BW: 
You’re welcome. 
 
LG: 
Lisa Gabbert, and I am talking to (my husband) Dr. Bill Walsh. Today is September 20th 
–  
 
BW: 
Yep, still; yeah. 
 
LG: 
2019. Okay. 
 
BW: 
Alright. 
 
LG: 
Thanks.
