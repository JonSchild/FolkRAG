My father was a 
farmer, 
And lived upon his farm; 
And well I 
do remember 
The old farm house and barn. 
And the pretty little garden, 
Where often seeds l've sown; 
I 
love to think and ponder o'er 
My little country home. 
CHORUS. 
My little country home, 
On a 
bright and sunny morn, 
You could hear the birds a 
singing, 
When the day began to dawn. 
And the ducks would quack, quack, quack, 
And the chickens cacklz, too; 
The rooster he would flap his wings, 
And, cry cock-e-doodle-doo. 
We'd rise up in the morning, 
Just at the break of day; 
We'd drive the cows to pasture, 
And give the horses hay. 
Then to the fields we'd gather, 
To hoe and rake the corn; 
At noon we're always sure to hear 
The welcome dinner horn. 
On wint r 
nights we'd gather 
Beside the cheerful grate, 
And listen to the stories 
Our father would relate. 
But now those days have vanished, 
No matter where I 
roam, 
In meni'ry dear I 
will revere, 
My dear old country home.

When the roses fall asleep, love, 
In the fading of the day; 
Does your heart then silent weep, love, 
For the one so far away ? 
And, when kneeling, pure in prayer, love, 
Am I 
thought of then by thee! 
And does, while I 
am not there, love, 
One kind prayer ascend for me? 
CHORUS. 
When the roses softly sleep, love, 
When the roses softly sleep, 
Do you sigh then for my coming, 
When the roses softly sleep? 
Softly sleep, softly sleep, 
When the roses softly sleep. 
When the roses, love, are sleeping, 
Does your heart with thoughs of me 
Ever hold in sacred keeping, 
That sweet love for me at sea. 
Is there, then, one look of sorrow, - 
In thy blue eyes hidden deep ? 
Do thy lips call for the morrow, 
When the roses softly sleep. 
Chorus. 
When the roses, love, are sleeping, 
Do you feel that parting pain? 
Does thy heart while softly weeping, 
Call me home to th2e again ? 
Tg there, then, one kiss of gladness, 
Pressed upon the ring you keep ? 
Do you sigh for me in sadness, 
When the roses softly sleep.

part: 
I 
bid good-bye to thee alone, 
But not to thy fond loving heart. 
For though, for years, the treach'rons sea,

Will bring me back to thee again.

We only part to meet again. 
Good-bye, sweetheart, the day will come,

Then watch, with ever loving heart.

REGAN'S PARTY 
WORDS AND MUSIC BY WM CARROLL. SUNG BY THE MURPHY& 
MUSIC PUB. & COPYRIGHT, 1881 BY WM. J. A. LIEDER. 
It was over at old Regan's house, we had a 
jolly time, 
There was lots of dancing, I 
tell you it was fine, 
Oh ! the boys and girls enjoyed themselves, for 
they came far and near, 
And all the lads assembled there, to tty old 
Regan's beer. 
Old Regan he felt lively for a 
time, 
And a 
happier man I 
don't think could be found, 
He told us that the house was ours, to do just as 
we liked, 
So then we had a 
drink of bear all round, 
CHORUS. 
Oh ! such singing, and such dancing lion my 
word ' twas really grand, 
And the music sounded just as well as if it was a 
band 
While Murphy played the fiddle, they danced 
up and down the middle, 
And we never left old Regan till the morn. 
There was Mary Jones and Jerry Flynn got up 
to dance a 
jig, 
Along with Michael Cronin's wife, who looked 
like Murphy's pig, 
The floor they welted beautiful, and went round 
hand in han,l, 
But Cronin's wife she danced so much that she 
could hardly stand, 
Then James O'Brien he got up to sing a 
song, 
But they did not seem to relish it one bit, 
They yanked him out so gently that he thought 
his time had come, 
And the poor old fellow fell into a 
fit. 
Chorus. 
They danced away till broad daylight, the sun 
broke in the sky, 
But McCarthy's wife was so fatigued, she thought 
she'd really die, 
M'Guinness got overpowered on wine and lager beer, 
He felt so good he tried to do a 
pirouette on his ear, 
And poor old Jerry Dolan was found sleeping 
With a 
vice like grip upon a 
china cup, 
And when they danced the last quadrille the 
fiddler fell asleep, 
And that's what wound old Regan's party tr..).

BE HOME EARLY TO- NIGHT, MY 
DEAR BOY, 
SUNG WITH GREAT SUCCESS BY MISS QUEEN HETHERTON. 
IND LEW BAKER. 
I 
have traveled through life, I 
have seen many things. 
That surprised me in every form; 
I 
have been at the plow, I 
have been at the spade, 
'Till dark, and at sunrise in the morn. 
But at night I 
would go for some pleasure thro' town, 
I 
was always for pleasure and joy; 
My mother would say when going away, 
Be home early, to-night, my dear boy. 
CHORUS. 
Be home early, to-night, my dear boy, 
Be home early, to-night, my dear boy; 
Don't spend all your money to gamble and drink, 
Be home early, to-night, my dear boy. 
One night I 
left home, and my poor mother was sick, 
In fever of torture and pain; 
She says, my dear boy, take the motto I 
give, 
I 
may not give it to you again. 
But when I 
returned from my night's fun and joy, 
I 
heard my poor mother was dead. 
'Twas then a 
cold chill through my body did run, 
When I 
thought of the last words she said. 
Cho. 
All young men that are here, take a 
word of advice, 
To your father and mother attend; 
For a 
good mother's love it must not be forgot, 
When she's gone you've lost your best friend, 
Don't spend all your money to gamble and drink, 
There are many things you can enjoy; 
Take the lesson I 
give'twas a 
mother's request, 
Keep good hours at night my dear boys. 
Chorus.

THE BLUE ALSATIAN MOUNTAINS 
BY CIABABBLL. 
MUSIC BY STEPHEN ADAM. 
By the blue Alsatian mountains, 
Dwelt a 
maiden young and fair; 
Like the careless flowing fountains 
Were the ripples of her hair. 
Were the ripples of her hair; 
Angel mild, her eyes so winning, 
Inge' bright her happy smile, 
When beneath the fountain spinning, 
A-de, A-de, Ade, 
Such songs will pass away; 
Tho' the blue Alsatian mountains, 
Seem to watch and wait alway 
By the blue Alsatian mountains, 
Many spring-times bloomed and passed, 
And the maiden by the fountains, 
Saw she lost her hopes at last, 
She lost her hopes at last. 
And she withered like a 
flower, 
That is waiting for the rain; 
She will never see the stranger, 
Where the fountains fall again. 
A- de, A-de, A-de, 
The years have passed away, 
But the blue Alsatian mountains 
Ever watch and wait alway, 
A- de, A- de, A-de. 
The years have passed away, 
But the blue Alsatian mountains, 
Seem to watch and wait alway. - 
By the blue Alsatian mountains, 
Came a 
stranger in the spring, 
And he lingered by the fountains, 
Just to hear the maiden sing, 
Just to hear the maiden sing; 
Just to whisper in the moonlight, 
Words the sweetest she had known, 
Just to charm away the hours, 
Till her heart was all his own. 
A- de, A-de, A- de, 
Such dreams must pass away. 
But the blue Alsatian mountains 
Seena to watch and wait alway.

By my brogue you can tell I'm a

By my dress you can see I'm a 
true son if Mars; 
Tho' for fighting and blood-shed l'in not much careing. 
I'll show no white feather if sent to the wars. 
But I'll fight with comrades protecting the banner, 
Beloved by all subjects that's loyal and true; 
'us the pride of the world always waving supremely, 
It will ne'er be disgraced by Fitzpatrick Macliew. 
CHORUS. 
Then bring in the punch and replenish your glasses, 
And drink to our soldiers and jolly jack tars, 
Here's a 
health to old Ireland and all her fair lasses, 
Long life to each boy in the Irish Huzzars. 
I 
remember the ranks when I 
was a 
wee fellow, 
My father, drum major, was just six feet high, 
My mother, God bless her, I 
often wold,1 tell her, 
When a 
man I 
would fight to win honor or die, 
Since then to the country I've seen a 
great service, 
I've smiled at all danger ne'er wincing at sears, 
When bullets were flying, where the fray was 
the thickest, 
The foremost of all were the Irish huzzars. 
Chorus. 
To the bugle's shrill notes I've obeyed like a 
soldier, 
When hungers sharp thorns in my bosom were deep; 
When darkness our forms has shielded from 
dailger, 
The roar of the cannon has lulled me to sleep. 
At the close of the fight with the moon as our guardian, 
When peace was proclai 
1 'neath the bright 
meA, 
shining stars; 
Our commanders stern voices were heard loudly calling 
God bless you, my bold gallant Irish lluzzars.

I.am thinking of the day when but a 
little child, 
I 
wandered o'er the meadows to the hill, 
Where the sweet flowers grew, and forever 
growing wild, 
And the stream e'er flowed by the mill. 
But the old mill house has gone to decay, 
I 
loved it and so did darling Kate, 
And the miller he lies sleeping where the 
gentle breezes blow 
And we played ' neath the turnpike gate. 
CHORUS. 
For the turnpike gate is the pride of my heart, 
I 
loved it and so did darling Kate, 
When she sits beside me now, there's a 
smile 
upon her brow, 
That reminds me of the turnpike gate. 
And the old school house has gone to decay, 
Where the schoolmaster heard us recite, 
And those happy, happy days have faded 
from our view, 
When our little hearts were filled with delight 
And when school was out we would wander to 
the spring, 
Where I 
drew for you pictures on your slate; 
And those happy childhood days they'll come 
again no mon, 
When we played on the turnpike gate.

A POW OF TENEMENT HOUSES. 
SUNG BY NILES AL 
EVANS. AIR : 
BLUE ALSATIAN MOUNTAINS. 
In a 
row of tenement houses, 
Lived a 
damsel young and fair, 
Her papa wore the trousers 
When her mamma wasn't there. 
Maiden with a 
dimpled eyebrow, 
With a 
voice so young and 'fair, 
Maiden with a 
yaller bull-dog, 
That followed her everywhere. 
Each day, each day, each day. 
Some family would move away, 
For that row of tenement houses 
Never seemed to please or pay. 
To that row of tenement houses 
Came a 
granger in the Spring, 
Just to talk of sheeps and cowses, 
And to hear that maiden sing. 
Just to hear that maiden sing, 
Oh! he spoke about his barnyard, 
Of his chickens and his hog; 
But she thought he was giving her taffy, 
So she called her yaller dog. 
Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah! 
That granger he ran away, 
But left the bosom of his trouses, 
For the dog to chew that day.

MAN YOU DON'T MEET 
EVERY DAY, 
I've a 
nice little cabin that's built with mud, 
In the beautiful County Kildare, 
I've got acres of land, and men at command, 
And I 
have always a 
shilling to spare. 
Och! I 
didn't come here, boys, in search of a 
job, 
But just a 
short visit to pay, 
And as I 
walk through the streets, people say 
that I 
meet, 
There's the man you don't meet every day. 
CHORUS. 
Then call for your glasses, just have what you want, 
And whatever the damage I'll pay; 
Bhoys be airy and free when you're drinking wid me, 
For I'm the man you don't meet every day. 
When I 
landed in Glasgow, what a 
sight met 
my eyes, 
As I 
first put my foot on the shore; 
There was Felix O'Donough, blind Barney McGurk, 
And a 
round two or three dozen more. 
Och! murther! you ought to have seen them 
all stare, 
And then they did all run away; 
Says I, • 1 my spalpeens, do you think I'm a 
ghost, 
Because I'm a 
man you don't meet every day. 
Chorus. 
I'm in love with a 
nice little girl in town, 
And we're going to be married to-day, 
And if you come over a 
twelvemonth from now, 
A 
right welcome to all I 
will pay. 
And I 
think I 
can show you a 
little spalpeen, 
Who then will be able to say._ 
To my friends round about, while yointing me out, 
There's the man you don't meet every day.

Last winter was a

Well, ' tis myself that knows it, for it's many's the day, 
Your husband wasn't the only man sat behind the wall, 
There's my old man McGuiness didn't get no job at all. 
The politicians promised him work ors the boulevard, 
To handle a 
pick and shovel and throw dirt on the cal t. 
Ali! six months ago they promised hitu work he'd shortly get 
But believe me, my good woman, they are promising him yet. 
CHORUS 
Then cheer up, Mrs. Reily and dk n't give way to the blues, 
You and I

As for me l'm done crying, no more will I 
sigh or sob, 
DI wait till times get better, when McGuinness gets a 
job. 
The Italians, divil take them, why didn't they stay at home, 
Slinre we had plenty of our own class to ate up all our own; 
They come out like bees in summer time and sworn for to stay; 
The contractors they have hundreds for forty e-nts a 
day,

MeGuiness will go back to his trade, share he's a

Ton soould see him clindithe ladder as nimble as a

Lonely and weary, poor, homeless, forsaken, 
Out in the cold bitter hours of the night, 
Wandering far away, while fear; awaken. 
Dread of the fast coining sunbeams of light. 
Far from the home and the pleasures of childhood, 
With vile companions an exile from joy ; 
Longing once more for the charms of the wildwood, 
And for dear mother ho welcome her boy. 
Clioars. 
Go for my boy for I 
know he's heart broken, 
Bring him once more to life's sunshine and joy, 
Thus in the old home a 
dear voice has spoken, 
Mother is waiting to welcome her boy. 
Cold is the night , and the wintry wind blowing, 
Chills the poor wanderer, friendless, afar ; 
While in the darkness, which way is he going? 
Must be repose ' fiend' the pale evening star ? 
Wine is a 
mocker, then why is he seeking. 
That which will mar his pure heart with alloy, 
While a 
sweet voice now is tenderly speaking, 
Mother is waiting to welcome her boy.

Mother is Waiting to*Weleome her Boy. 
CONTINUED. 
Oh ! how she peers in the face of each stranger, 
Eager to see her boys smiles once again ; 
Longing and praying to shield him from danger, 
Anxious to care for and soothe him in pain. 
Lone is the heart of that poor mother waiting. 
Wrinkled and gray. tor one moment of joy; 
While with his evil companions he's straying, 
Far from the mother who longs for her boy. 
Go for my boy, dtc. 
jnce he was pure as the babe in the manger, 
But friends were false, and they led him astray, 
Far from his home he has wandered a 
stranger, 
Reckless through drink, as you see him to-day I 
But who can tell how his heart has been saddened, 
When he has dreamed of lost friendship and joy, 
With no sweet thoughts when his brain has been maddened 
Mother would welcl.,me her wandering boy. 
Go for my boy, ito, 
Gio for my boy to- night! search through the city ! 
Tell him that mother will never forget! 
Though he is fallen— oh I 
bring him in pity, 
Back to the mother who loves her boy yet! 
Tell him she never will weary of prayirg, 
For his return bringing sunshine and joy; 
Bear him this message, where'er he is straying,

THE GREAT MEN THAT IRELAND 
HAS SEEN, 
TEM MUSIC SENT TO ANY ADDRESS ON RECEIPT OF 40etse 
Now since I 
appear here before you once -more, 
I'll endeavor to gain your fair smile, 
Tho' years now have passed since I 
left the old shore, 
I 
still cling to the dear native isle. 
Ind I'll sing of old_ Ireland, the land of my birth, 
I 
will sing of the great men that's been, 
Khose deeds of renown shall shine round each heart 
They were great men that Ireland has seen. 
CHORTJS. 
Then here's to the sons of old Ei 
Go Bragh, 
May the memory of their names still be green, 
On sea, or on coast, let us drink off this toast, 
To the great men that Ireland has seen. 
O'Connell you know, as all history does show, 
Was a 
statesman; whose equal was few, 
At the great Parliament, he did often represent, 
That the wrongs of old Ireland were true. 
And Emmet the martyr, he fought for our cause, 
Like a 
laurel his name it keeps green, 
He died for his country and Liberty's laws, 
Those were great men that Ireland has seen. 
Cho. 
‘.nd then we had Sarsfield who conquered each foe, 
And never was known for to yield, 
The foeman would quake, aye, and tremble and shake, 
When his war horse would enter the field; 
And then as for poets there is no land I'm sure, 
Where such brilliant genius has been, 
There was Grattan and Lover, and famous Tom Moor; 
Those were great men that Ireland has seen. 
Cho. 
But though those great men have now passed away, 
Old Erin shall not be alone, 
We have men that would die for their country to-day, 
And a 
parliament wish of their own; 
But may God guide and guard them to do what is right, 
May they harbor no rancor or spleen, 
But when honor demands them they valiantly fight, 
Like the great men that Ireland has see'.

LAKE SHORE ON SUNDAY NIGHT, 
WRITTEN AND SUNG BY FRAME LIM 
I 
am going to sing a 
funny song, 
And the subject is not very long, 
It's all about the funny sights, 
On the lake shore on a 
Sunday night. 
Such droves of people I 
declare. 
From five till ten, are walking there, 
All other streets deserted quite, 
For the Lake Shore on a 
Sunday night. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! if you doubt then what I 
say, 
Go yourself most any day, 
rlo yourself and see the sights, 
On the lake shore on Sunday night. 
There are bachelors gay sporting away, 
Laughing and talking with maidens gay, 
And old maids you will often find 
With little poodle dogs behind, 
Oh! don't they one another squeeze, 
It's when they feel the evening breeze, 
If the stars could speak tell tales they might, 
Of Lake View Park on Sunday night. 
Chorus,. 
I'll tell you what me most annoys, 
It is to see so many naughty boys, 
Running around with common cigars, 
When they should be home with their 
pa's and mat.. 
And young girls scarce sixteen years old, 
Running around them so bold, 
And doing things that isn't right, 
On the Lake Shore on Sunday night, 
Chonbt 
Young widows tired of single life, 
Wishing to become again a 
wife, 
Are trying with many a 
wicked leer, 
To catch a 
stylish husband dear. 
And gay young sports a 
strolling along, 
Singing " Maggie Gordon" or some love song. 
With sweethearts under their arm so tight, 
On the Lake Shore on Sunday night.

PARODY ON EMPTY CRADLE. 
WRITTEN AND SUNG BY CHAS. G
-LIDDEN. 
Once I 
owned a 
yellow dog his name WAS 
Towser Jenkins, 
A butcher cut his tail off with a 
cleaver; 
Towser had his trade-mark on all the cats in town, 
And when he spotted one he'd never leave her, 
He wore his legs off stumpey, 
Chaseing milk carts round the country, 
But the little house is empty where we ties him, 
A 
policeman spotted Towser, put some arsenic 
in his grub, 
Empty is the dog-house Towser's pizened. 
CHORUS. 
He's gone to look for rats in the happy hunting grounds 
He died this morning while the sun was rising; 
The flees have all turned out to hunt up a 
new 
lunch route, 
Empty is the dog-house Towser's pizened. 
Oh! how that dog would grin, when a 
tramp 
would look at him, 
He used to put hay-windows in their breeches; 
Wore the hair all off his ribs, 
Chaseing cats around corn cribs, 
Had bunions on his knees from jumping ditches, 
On his nose he had two blisters, 
Where the rats chewed off his whiskers, 
When he was asleep they'd paralyze him. 
But now he's gone and dusted, 
And his chest prstector's busted, 
Empty is the dog-house Towser's pizened. 
CHORUS. 
He has gone to hunt for liver, 
Way acrossed the Swa,nee river, 
No more in the sewer we'll baptise him, 
No more he'll homeward sail, 
With tin can's upon his tail, 
Empty is the dog-house-Towser's pizened.

Sweet music it, was play'd; 
Arrah! forward four, we welt the floor,

At ten o'clock, precisely, 
We had to close the door; 
It was crowded to suffocation, 
And it could not hold no more. 
There was ninety-seven couples 
Round the hall did promenade— 
Did Ireland was represented 
At Kerrigan's Masquerade! 
Maw 
Kerrigan was dressed, I 
do declare. 
Regardless of expense, 
Re waxed his moustache up with soap, 
He fairly looked immense. 
His hair was tarred with axel grease. 
He had a 
five cent shave; 
it would make you die when to waltz he tried.

There's a 
dear spot of land far out, on the sea, 
And its known as fair Erin's green isle ; 
Sure it's there I 
was born on a 
bright summer's morn, 
And with joy my relations did rinile. 
My father and mother, my sister and brother, 
Were pleased, to- be- sure, all the while. 
fbey shed tears of joy, for their bright Irish boy, 
That was born on fair Erin's green isle. 
You may talk about France, or England or Spain, 
Of their beautiful maids and greut men ; 
Bat the whole world does know that fair Erin can shoal 
Nobler sons, truer daughters, than them. 
,Such names as O'Connell and Moore I 
will mention, 
And brave Duke of Wellington, while 
King Brian Borogline, and our bold Emmett too, 
Saw the light on fair Erin's Green Isle,

For their beauty is really sublime. 
There grows in profusion the dear little shamrock, 
Encouraged by Nature's sweet Jmile, 
Dear land of-my birth, garden spot of the earth,

That nestles alone in its resting plaoe,

Some sad, sad hope, that one did bloom,

There's a 
happy little cot down in southern Tennessee, 
Where the ivy blossoms twine round the door, 
And forever fresh and green in my memory it will be, 
Enough I 
know I'll never see it any more; 
But I 
never can forget the old home I 
love so well, 
And the many good old tunes that I 
have sung, 
And the tears they fill my eyes every time I 
try to tell 
Of the times I 
used to have when I 
was young. 
CHORUS. 
Vow the tambo and the bones, am forever lai .1 
away, 
The fiddle and the banjo am unstrung; 
But I 
often heave a 
sigh for the happy days gone by, 
And the times I 
used to have when I 
was young. 
When the autumn days had come, I 
would 
husk the yellow corn, 
In the fields I 
was singing all the day, 
taid before they made me free I 
had never cause 
to mourn; 
And around the old place everything was gay; 
Arid many and many a 
time when the work of 
day was over, 
'With my melody the old plantation rung, 
An d 
my heart does often long for the happy 
days of yore, 
Aaad the times I

Oh ! love it is such a 
very funny thing, 
It catches the young and the old, 
It's just like a 
plate of boarding-house hash, 
For many's the man's been sold. 
It will make you feel like a 
fresh-water eel, 
It will cause your heart for to swell, 
You may love your wife as you do your life, 
But 'twill empty your pocket-book as well. 
So boys, keep away from the girls, I 
say, 
And give them plenty of room, 
You will find when you're wed, they'll bang 
you till you're dead, 
With the bawld-headed end of a 
broom. 
When a 
man's in love with a 
pretty little girl, 
He talks as gentle as a 
dove, 
He calls her his honey, and he spends lots of money, 
For to show her he's solid in love. 
When his money's all gone, and his clothes up 
the spout, 
He will find the old saying true, 
That a 
bird in the hand is worth two in the bush, 
What the deuce is a 
fellow going to do. 
With a 
wife and fourteen half-starved kids, 
And tell you it ain't no fun, 
When the butcher comes around to collect his bills, 
With a 
dog and a 
double barrelled gun. 
So boys, keep away from the girls, I 
say, 
And give them plenty of room, 
You'll think you are in clover, till the honey-
moon is over, 
And then you will wish you were dead. 
With a 
cross-
eyed baby on each knee, 
With a 
wife with a 
wart on her nose, 
You will find that love don't run so smooth, 
When you have to wear your second-hand clothes, 
'When the rents are high the kids will cry, 
Kase they ain't got nothing for to thaw, 
You'll holler for your son to load up the gus, 
For to vaccinate your mother-in-law.

DON'T GO TO YOUR RELATIONS. 
  ,k.ND SUNG BY FRANK MM. 
We all have our shares of ups and downs 
In every rank and station; 
We are sure to get more kicks and frowns, 
If we depend on kind relations. 
It's all very well once or twice to drop in, 
And ask for a 
little in favor, 
But if by chance you go a 
third time, 
They'll construe it to your bad behavior 
CHORUS. 
So my advice take one and all, 
In every rank and station, 
And if you want a 
favor done, 
Don't go to your relations. 
I 
speak from experience, and some you'll find 
How often they'll invite you, 
But when poverty comes close behind, 
They will soon begin to slight you. 
It's clear away, there's a 
knock at the door, 
Don't open the door too wide John, 
I'm afraid it's that hungry brother of mine, 
Say I'm gone out for a 
ride, John. Chon& 
I 
thought my sister would prove a 
friend, 
But soon she did deceive me, 
She said these times were not times to lend, 
She would if she could relieve me, 
A 
trifle sister, would keep me afloat. 
I 
shall sink if you don't arrange it. 
She said. she'd no less than a 
five dollar note, 
Chorio 
And she hadn't time to change it. 
I 
lost my goods but found that day, 
Though against me they had sinned all; 
Death called a 
rich old friend of mine, 
Who left me a 
handsome wind-fall. 
But how they altered what they said, 
Their ways were so provoking, 
To hear them say as they hung their heads, 
k, 
Why Frank we were only joking. Chortil 
There is none in this world so blessed as _I, 
With so many kind relations, 
I 
am invited to breakfast, dinner, and tea, 
I've a 
hundred invitations. 
1 
refuse them all though my heart it burns, 
Their friendship I 
don't heed it, 
Tor I 
hate the cold heart that in poverty spurns, 
IWO only gives to those ths.t don't need ;A

I 
once did know a

He used to work upon his farm 
Around his country home. 
He had an only daughter,

asked her to be mine, 
The old man did reply.

Treat my daughter kindly, 
And say you'll do no harm, 
And when I 
die 
I'll leave you both, 
My little stock and farm; 
My horse, my cow, my sheep, my plow, 
My home, my pump. my barn, 
And all the little chickens in the garden. 
I 
loved this young dearly, 
And I 
thought that she loved me, 
And every evening I 
would go, 
Her lovely face to see. 
And watch her milk her father's cow, 
In it I 
saw 114) harm, 
And lots of fun I'd always have, 
Before 
left the barn. 
Her father has consented, 
And we two will married be; 
We'll own our little country home, 
And live in harmony. 
No sorrow seems to hover o'er 
Our little cottage home, 
For all is blithe and happiness, 
Although we live alone.

DEDICATED TO MISS ADA BURNETT. 
While it's true that fine feathers make fine 
l00%ing birds, 
A 
tree's known by the fruit that it bears, 
And a 
man should be judged by his actions not wprds, 
Nor that of the coat that he wears. 
For you'll find in the ranks of this world's brotherhood 
Much that's pure and vicious and bad, 
But never a 
man that is all over good, 
Nor one that is all over bad.

While a 
wolf in sheep's clothes shedding crocodile tears, 
Trys to pass liaise-f 
off for a 
saint, 
And the proud Pharisee hurries onward with livers, 
As the wayfarer looks sick and faint, 
How often we see some despised•Magdelene, 
Doing what good Samaritans do, 
And relieving the sufferers passed by proud men, 
Though they spend lifes of shame it is true.

Memory gently leads me backward to the shores 
of long ago, 
Bright with many recollections dear to me; 
Happy faces smile upon me mid the breaking 
o'er the strand, 
Of the silvery surges made by memory's sea. 
Childhood's playmates cluster round me, friends 
of manhood's sterner years, 
Who have ceased the weary paths of life to roam; 
But amid the throng of faces there is one I 
treasure most, 
Of a 
mother whom the angels beckoned home. 
CHORUS. 
'Tis the vision of my mother, she who rocked 
me when a 
babe, 
And who guarded me within my cradle nest; 
Earthly riches I 
would part with, just to hear 
her voice again, 
Of that mother whom the angels called to rest.

She it was who softly murmured loving words 
above my head, 
As she held me ere she laid me down to sleep; 
And through weary hours of danger, every 
effort gladly made, 
For my comfort, while she oft would o'er me weep. 
Faintly I 
can still remember songs of melody she sang, 
Prayers she offered that I 
might be always blest, 
But at last she left her treasure to the Saviour's 
watchful care, 
for the angels beckoned her to come and rest. 
I 
have passed those youthful hours and have 
grown to manhood's age, 
Still my fancy often bids me backward stray. 
To the sunny days of childhood when the 
hours were sweetly spent, 
With the loved one lying now beneath the clay. 
Childhood's prayers will have been answered 
when at last my life is o'er, 
And I'll deem myself forever blessed, 
,Can I 
meet again and listen to the one I've 
treasured dear, 
Whom the angels beekoned'home with them to rest.

Ther'es a 
dear spot of land far out on the ocean, 
The prettiest island that ever was seen; 
There's no place on earth that sc well suits 
my notioft. 
It's the Emerald isle where the shamrock is green, 
Alas ! the bold tyrant has taken possession. 
And driven our daughters and sons to exile, 
For no one could stand their tyranic aggression, 
And banished are we from the Emerald Isle. 
Then its God speed the day that will dawn with 
our freedom. 
When the stars and the harp shall be blended as one, 
Then the poor of ould Ireland will need no help

They'll belong to the country of brave Washington.

'When young I 
was praised, and my wages was raised, 
No labor then I 
ever did shirk; 
And my master would then point me out to the men, 
As the one who best stuck to his work. 
Now I'm feeble and weak, he'll to me hardly speak. 
Unless it's to grumble or scold; 
They simply make fun of what I 
have done, 
That's how you get served when you'ae old. 
Chorus 
My 
wife poor soul she is nearly seventy-three, 
How to keep her from want I 
don't know; 
If I 
beg, I 
intrude, and by police are pursued, 
And if to the Commissioners of Charities we go, 
To seek for relief they but add to our grief, 
You must go to the Island we are told, 
Part husband from wife, to be paupers for life, 
Thet's how you get served when you're old.

SOMEBODY'S MOTHER. 
RECITED BY GUS WILLIAMS. 
The woman was old and raged and gray, 
And bent with the chill of a 
winter's day; 
The streets were white with recent snow, 
And the woman's feet were aged and slow. 
At the crowded crossing she waited long, 
Jostled aside by the careless throng 
Of human beings who passed her by, 
Unheeding the glance of her anxious eye. 
Down the street with laughter and shout, 
Glad in the freedom of " school let out," 
Come happy boys, like a 
flock of sheep, 
Hailing the snow piled white and deep, 
Past the woman so old and gray, 
Hastened the children on their way. 
None offered a 
helping hand to her, 
So weak and timid afraid to stir, 
Lest the carriage wheels or the horses feet 
Should trample her down in the slippery street 
At last came out of the merry troop, 
The gayest boy of all the group; 
He paused beside her, and whispered low, 
" 
I'll help you across if you wish to go ?" 
Her aged hand on his strong young arm 
She placed, and so without hurt or harm, 
He guided the trembling feet along, 
Proud that his own were young and strong; 
Then back again to his friends he went, 
His young heart happy and well content, 
" 
She's somebody's mother, boys, you know, 
For all she's aged, and poor and slow; 
And someone, sometime, may lend a 
hand 
To help my mother—you understand 
If ever she's poor and old and gray, 
And her own dear boy is far away." 
" 
Somebody's mother." bowed low her head, 
In her home that night, and the prayer she sai6 
Was; " God be kind to that noble boy, 
Who is somebody's son and pride and joy." 
Faint was the voice, and worn and weak, 
But Heaven lists when its chosen speak; 
Angels caught the faltering word, 
And " Somebody's mother's" prayer was heard.

WHEN I 
SMOKED MY FIRST CIGAR; 
OM:POSED AND RECITED BY WALTER NAM 
Copyright 1SS1 by Mrs. Pauline Lleder. 
It was just behind the woodshed, 
One glorious summer day; 
Far o'er the hills the sinking sus, 
Pursued its western way. 
And in my lone seclusion, 
Safely removed afar 
From all earth's confusion, 
I 
smoked my first cigar. 
Ali I 
bright the boyish fancies, 
Wrapped in the wreaths of blue, 
My eyes grew dim my head was light, 
The woodshed round me flew, 
Dark night closed in around me, 
11,ayless without a 
star, 
Wm 
death I 
thought I 
had found. 
When I 
smoked my first cigar. 
I 
heard my fathers smothered laugh, 
It seemed so strange and far; 
I 
knew he knew, I 
knew he knew, 
I'd smoked my first cigar,

How are yous one and all, 
Sure we thot' we'd make a 
call, 
And tell you all about the widow's party, 
'Twas at Paythogoras Hall, 
We gave a 
break- down ball, 
And invited all the young fi lks gay and hearty, 
There was handsome Paddy Grace, 
Sure he's now on the police, 
He was put there by a 
pol-i-tic-al party. 
He came from County Cork, 
To the City of New York, 
He joked and sang and made us all feel hearty. 
CHORUS. 
Ali ! the charming Widow Clancy, 
She was any man's fancy, 
She was a 
fluent talker, and a 
rattling six-day walke-
., 
And a 
Venus is the charming Widow Clancy. 
McGinn sang Pin- a- fore, 
Till his throat was very sore, . 
And " Little Dudeen," sang by Smith so sweetly, 
Crosby sang a 
little ditty, 
The girls all called him witty, 
And McGuffin done an Irish jig so neatly. 
Flynn sang, " Dancing on the green," 
Also " She's a 
fairy queen." 
Flood sang " Hold the fort for we're the 
strongest party," 
And Murphy and 'lira Lang, 
Done the Lack-a-wan-na Gang, 
Down at the charming Widow Clancy's party. Cho. 
As it was growing late, 
Sure we tho't was time to ate, 
We went in two by two's down to the supper, 
We were hardly seated right, 
When there was a 
fearful fight, 
For McGuinness swore the whiskey was all water, 
All around 'twas hand to hand, 
And they nearly killed the band, 
When in stepped the famous boxer Mike McCarthy, 
He swore by the powers above, 
That he'd just put on the gloves, 
And clear out every sucker in the party.

Sweetly in the twilight dancing, 
Fairy-like with form entrancing, 
Cunning elf with mischief glancing, 
Little roguish eyes ; 
O'er the dew with lightness creeping, 
While the glow-worm soft is sleeping, 
And the bright stars forth are peeping, 
Peeping with surprise. 
As she wanders through the dell, 
Hushed is every birdie's song, 
For each songster knows full well, 
She rules the warbling throng. 
Brighter seems the day declining, 
as with sunlight still combining, 
Where her gleam o'er all is shining, 
Little roguish eyes. 
Blithely in the eariy morning, 
Summer d4ty is gently dawning, 
Lifting night's be-darkened awning, 
Little roguish eyes; 
As she wades the brooklet flowing, 
Moves amid the violets growing, 
Not a 
thought on one bestowing, 
Which around her lies. 
May her future life be pure, 
May her sweetness never fade, 
May grim sorrow ne'er secure, 
My own dear mountain maid. 
Joy o'er all my darling flinging, 
Hear the lark her praises singing, 
For to all sweet mirth she's bringing, 
Little roguish eyes,

You may think that I 
am mad, 
But I 
only feel so sad, 
The reason I 
will tell you every one ; 
I 
courted a 
nice young girl, 
Whose name was Peggy Doyle, 
And I 
brought her to Coney Isle to have some ftsk, 
She is from the County Down, 
And she weighed two hundred pound, 
And I 
thought that she'd be true to me all the whale. 
But if I 
had to do it again, 
She would never go to swim 
Along with me down to Coney Isle. 
CHORUS. 
She had salt water sure, galore, 
And she swallowed a 
quart or more, 
And the gang upon the beach began to smile, 
They an did wave their hats, 
And shouted " float her pat," 
The day I 
brought my Peg to Coney Isla. 
Now its when we reached the pier, 
We went and had some beer, 
Arxi after that we went and had a 
bathe, 
You may talk about your fat woman 
That traveled with Barnum's show, 
But you ought to see my Peg upon the waves. 
The gang commenced to guy us, 
My bosom was on fire. 
(Chem 
When the gang gave to me a 
grand hurray, 
When a 
lad with a 
crooked mouth, 
"Beheave us" shouted out, 
There's one of the sea lions that escaped the otherday, 
Of course I 
did feel mail, after listening; to that lad, 
Of oourse he thought that he was awful smart, 
But if I 
had him in New York 
Up near the Central Park, 
You can bet. your life that I 
would break his heart, 
I 
don't say Pin a 
fighter, a 
cutter or a 
biter, 
But I 
can talcs; my own part all the while. 
.Arrah-muslia had luck to l'eg, she will stand 
upon her he 
&lore I 
bring her again to Coney Isle.

While strolling out alone one summer's cley, 
Down by a 
running brook, 
A 
pretty girl I 
chanced to meet, 
I 
never shall forget her look. 
With dark blue eyes and golden . hair, 
And teeth as white as snow, 
Her heart I 
won in the shining sun, 
Where pretty lilacs grow. 
CHORUS. 
When the birds are singing in the glittering stuushistek 
There's none so fair as this pretty girl of mine, 
I 
never shall forget where first we met, 
My pretty little beau, 
One summers night when the moon shone bright, 
Where pretty lilacs grow. (Defoe.) 
There is a 
happy day to come, 
A 
day I'll never dread, 
When together to the church we go, 
And this pretty little maid I 
wed. 
Where the little birds are singing in the trot, 
We'll ramble to and fro, 
And ne'er forget where first we met, 
Where pretty lilacs grow.
