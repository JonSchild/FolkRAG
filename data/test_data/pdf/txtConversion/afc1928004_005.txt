KATHLEEN MAVOURNEEN. 
IRISH BALLAD. 
As sung by Miss CATHARINE HAYES. 
Kathleen Mavourneen! the grey dawn is breaking, 
'the horn of the hunter is heard on the hill, 
The lark from her light wing the bright dew is 
shaking, 
Kathleen Mavourneen, what slumb'ring still. 
! 'last thou forgotten soon we must sever? 
Oh ! bast thou forgotten this day we must part, 
It may be for years, and it may be for ever, 
Oh why art thou silent, thou voice of my heart, 
It may be for years, and it may be for ever, 
Then why art thou silent Kathleen Mavourneen. 
Kathleen Mavourneen! aWake from thy slumbers, 
The blue mountains glow in the sun's golden 
light, 
All! where is the spell that once hung. on my 
numbers, 
Arise in thy beauty thou star of my night, 
Arise in thy beauty thou star of my night. 
Mavourneen, Mavourneen, my said tears are falling 
To think that from Erin and thee l 
must part, 
It may be for years, and it may be for ever, 
Then why art thou silent thou voice of my heart 
It may be for years, and it may be for ever, 
Then why art thou silent Kathleen Mavourneen.

Those happy days are gone, 
And I

The blighting hand of care 
Is trac'd upon my brow. 
The greenwoods and the bow'rs, 
Despairing, now, I 
fly 
My tender plants and flow'rs, 
Neglected, droop and die. 
The silent tears I 
shed, 
Shall ne'er be seen by thee, 
Those happy days are gone, 
And thou art lost to me, 
Yes, thou art lost to me. 
I 
shun the world's cold gaze, 
From all I 
strive to flee; 
But busy tnern'ry strays 
Unconscious back to thee. 
The love thine eyes first taught, 
Still glows for thee alone ; 
A 
love with anguish fraught, 
That lives tho' hope be gone. 
The silent tears I 
shed, 
Shall ne'er be seen by thee, 
Those happy days are gone, 
And thou art lost to me,

THE POOR MAN'S BRIDE. 
By permission of Firth, Pond & Co , publishers of the 
songs, as sung by Miss CATHARINE HAVES. at her 
Concerts in America. 
'Tis long since we were forc'd to part, at least it 
seems so to my grief; 
For sorrow wearies us like time, but ah ! it brings 
not times relief; 
As in our days of tenderness, before IOC stilt she 
seems to glide; 
And though my arms are wide as then, yet she 
will not abide. 
The day.light and the star-light shine, as if her 
eyes were in their light. 
And Whis'pring in the panting breeze, her love 
songs come at lonely night; 
While far away with those less dear, she tries to 
hide her grief in vain, 
For kind to all while true to me, it pains her to 
give pain. 
I know she never spoke her love, she never 
breath'd a 
single vow, 
And yet I'm sure she lov'd me then, and still, oh 
still doats on me now; 
For when we met, her eyes grew glad, and heavy 
when I 
left her side, 
And oft she said she'd be most happy, as a 
poor 
man's bride. 
I 
toiPd to win a 
pleasant home, and make it ready 
by the spring; 
The spring is past what season, now, my girl unto 
our home will bring, 
I'm ill and weary, very weary, watching, morning, 
night and noon, 
How long you're coming, I 
am dying, will you 
come not soon?

SHE SLEEPS IN THE GRAVE. 
By permis4on of G. P. Reed & Co., publishers of the 
songs, as sung by THE 11NRAIONEONS. 
How oft have you asked why I 
never am gay, 
Why my forehead is wrinkled, my hair has 
turned gray, 
Why the friends of iny heart, and the tried ones 
of years, 
Have ne'er seen me smile but oft found me in 
tears; 
Why I 
fly from your sports and your pastimes 
pass by, 
And why from my bosom I 
oft heave a 
sigh; 
But listen, my friends, ' tis the last time I'll have 
To tell of the dear one who sleeps in the grave: 
CIIORUS. 
She sleeps in the grave! she sleeps in the grave, 
Where the sweet flow'rs grow and the tall 
willows wave, 
And the mcon when she sails in the heavens 
above, 
Looks sadly and cold on the tomb of my love! 
POPULAR SONGS . 
Yes, alas! oh, alas! she has gone, she has gone! 
I 
have none to love now! I'm alone, all alone! 
She was sick ; arid my heart said with many a

That Dinah, the wife of my bosom, must die! 
How my heart beateth now as her last words I 
tell. 
She kissed me and said—Fare thee well! 0, 
Farewell!

My Dinah, my darling, lay dead on my breast.

FADED FLOWERS. 
By permission of G. P. Reed & Co., publishers of the 
songs, as sung by THE HARMONEONS. 
Oh the flow'rs that I 
saw in the wildwood, 
Have since drooped their beautiful leaves, 
And the many dear friends of my chiklhood, 
Have slumber'd for years in their graves. 
Oh, the bloom of the flow'rs I 
remember, 
And the siriles I 
shall never more see; 
For the cold chilly mists of December 
Stole my flow'rs and companions from me. 
Other roses may bloom on the morrow, 
And many a 
friend have I 
won, 
Yet my heart it can part but with sorrow, 
When I 
think of the ones that have gone; 
'Tis no wonder that 1 
broken hearted, 
And stricken with sorrow should be! 
We have met we have lov'd, we have parted, 
My flow'rs, my companions, and me! 
Oh! how dark looks this world and how dreary, 
When we part from the ones that we love 
But there's rest for the faint and the weary, 
And friends meet with lost ones above ! 
And in Heaven I 
can but remember, 
When from Earth my proud soul shall be free 
That no cold chilly winds of December, 
Can part my companions from me! 
By permission of G. P. Reed & Co, publishers of the

There's many a 
rose that sweetly blows, 
There's many a 
violet blue; 
The fairest flow'r blooms but an hour, 
And bids the world adieu. 
The fondest heart meets but to part, 
The sunlight's gaudiest hue, 
Is lost and gone when night comes on, 
And love scenes open new. 
CHORUS. 
Home, home, sweet, my own dear happy home: 
Oh, would that I 
were once more there, my own 
dear happy home; 
Oh, would that I 
were once more there, my own 
dear happy home. 
Yet dearest one, thou art alone 
More beautiful and true; 
All nature charm'd would he disarm'd, 
By one bright thought of you; 
The stars have eyes that pierce the skies, 
And twinkle gaily too, 
But diamonds bright can ne'er delight, 
An absent friend like you.

Haunting her spirit with dreamings of him,

Drift up for the lost one, who weepeth alone!

THE OLD ARM-CHAIR. 
A HIGHLY POPULAR SONG AS SUNG BY THE PRINCIPAL 
VOCULISTS. ‘,,t 
I 
love ti, I

To chide me for loving that old arm-chair? 
I've treasured it long as a

In childhood's hour I 
linger'd near 
The liallow'd seat with listening ear; 
And gentle words that mother would give 
To fit me to die, and teach me to live. 
She told me that shame would never betide, 
With Truth for my creed, and God for my guide; 
She taught me to lisp my earliest prayer, 
As I 
knelt beside that old arm-chair. 
I 
sat and watch'd her many a 
day, 
When her eye grew dim, and her locks were grey 
And I 
alniost Nvorshipp 'd her when she smiled, 
And turn'd from her-Bible to bless her child. 
Years roll'd on, but the last one sped— 
My idol was shatter'd, my earth-Aar fled!

When first I

Its murmurs breathing lowly round, 
Upon my startled senses fell,

And joy so long bath said farewell,

tent in the greenwood, a

If one faithful heart will but share it with me.

Our ems shall be nature's own beautiful flowers '

The proudest might envy our home in the vale. 
Lov'st thou to listen to music's sweet voice, 
Then fly to the woods where the song-birds w.

Or wouldst thou be free, to the forest repair, 
The stag in its freedom bounds merrily there. 
When summer has gone, and winter's chill hours 
Have rifled the greenwood and blighted the

THE MINSTREL'S LAMENT. 
WRITTEN BY J. E. CARPENTER, Esct 
Oh! would that I 
had never known. 
The bright but fatal gift of song, 
My hours had not unheeded flop 
Devoted to a 
wayward throne' 
The trobbing heart, the burning brow, 
Had both alike been spared to me, 
I 
had not felt the anguish now 
The Minstrel's lot must ever be ! 
My hours had not unheeded flown 
Devoted to the wayward throng; 
Then would that I 
had never known 
The bright but fatal gift of song. 
'Tis vain, my strange and wayward fate. 
A 
blessing and a 
curse bath sent; 
That makes me love that I 
should hate, 
And sing again while I 
lament; 
The Minstrel's soul uncheer'd by praise, 
Is like a 
lute with chords unstrung; 
And thus we have the pensive lays 
That former bards have played and sung, 
And thus my golden hours I've thrown 
Devoted to the wayward throng; 
Then would that I 
had never known 
The bright but fatal gift of song.

One image alone, on my bosom imprest, 
I 
lov'd my bleak regions, nor panted for new; 
And few were my wants, for my wishes were blest, 
And pure was my thoughts, for my soul was with 
you. 
I 
Left my wild home, and my visions are gone, 
The mountains are vanish'd, my hope is no more, 
As the last of' my race, I 
must wither alone, 
And delight but in days I 
have witnessed before,

The rose bud ting'd wi' morning show're. 
Bloom'd fresh within the sunnie bow'rs, 
But my Lassie was the fairest flow'r, 
That ever bloom'd in Gowrie. 
I 
had nae thought to do her wrong, 
But round her waist my arms I 
flang, 
And said, my Lassie will ye gang 
To view the Carse o'Gowrie; 
tak' ye to my Father's ha' 
In yon green field beside the shaw, 
And mak' ye lady o' them a' 
The brawest wife in Gowrie. 
Saft kisses on her lips I 
laid, 
Sweet blushes on her cheeks soon spread, 
She wisper'd modestly and said 
" 
I'll gang wi' ye to Gowrie." 
The auld folks soon gacd their consent, 
And to Mess John we quickly went, 
Wha tied us to our heart's content, 
And now she's Lady Gowrie.

THE LASS OF PATIE'S MILL. 
The lass o' Patie's mill, 
Sae bonnie blithe and gay, 
In spite of all my skill, 
She stole my heart away. 
When tedding out the hay 
Bareheaded on the green, 
Love ' midst her locks did play, 
And wanton'd in her een. 
Her arms, white, round and smooth; 
Breasts rising in their dawn; 
To age it would give youth, 
To press them wi' his ban'. 
Through all my spirits ran 
An ecstacy of blis=, 
When I 
such sweetness fand 
Wrapt in a 
balmy kiss. 
Oh ! had I 
a' the wealth 
Hopeton's high mountains fill, 
Insur'd long life and health, 
And pleasure at my will; 
I'd promise, and fulfil, 
That none but bonnie she, 
The lass of Patie's mill, 
Should share the same with me.

A 
Highland laddie heard of war, 
Which set his heart in motion; 
He heard the distant cannon roar, 
He saw the smiling ocean: 
Come weal come wo, to sea he'd go, 
And left one morning early 
Lock Lomond Ben, and the willow glen, 
And Jean that loved him dearly. 
He wander'd east, he vvander'd south, 
But joy he could not find it; 
But he found out this wholesome truth 
And had the sense to mind it,— 
Of a' the earth, the bonny north 
To cherish late and early ;

And Jean that loved him nearly.
