"Dear Mr. President", Austin, Texas, January or February 1942
AFS 6403B
Sam Coffee: This is Sam Coffee, Route 5, Austin, Texas. Mr. President, we're behind you throughout
this country solid, a hundred percent. [pause] The only thing that confronts the people now is,
seem like prices are inching up daily. If something could be done about that why it looks like that
everything would be lovely. I think that Abraham Lincoln, George Washington, and President
Roosevelt are three of the greatest men in the United States, greatest generals. We're all behind you
[disc skips].
