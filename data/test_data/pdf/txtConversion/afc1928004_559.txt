Here we are two factory lads, 
From Lancashire we came, 
Our parents in the cotton mill 
Are working now at home. 
But trade was slack, and pay is bad, 
So they sent us here 
To try and show you all the way 
They dance in Lancashire. 
Cnonus. 
We will make the wooden clogs go tap, tap, tap, 
If you'll but give a 
cheer, 
And ' twill give us great delight, 
To show you here to-night, 
How they dance in Lancashire. 
When at night our work is done, 
We dance out on the green, 
The lads and lassies all are there, 
With smiling faces seen. 
Now we've told you all our history, 
If you think us sincere, 
Bestow your kind applause upon 
These lads from Lancashire.

Listening to the music, 
Those strains they're such a

So now we'll execute for you, 
In our peculiar style so neat. 
In dancing there is pleasure, 
For it drives dull care away; 
A 
pastime of our boyhood, 
When the -heart's both light and gay. 
Our school-mates used to watch us, 
And smile but with conceit, 
To see us both amuse ourselves 
In our peculiar style so neat.

We have but just landed 
A 
few short days ago; 
We came from dear old Ireland, 
Where the little shamrocks grow. 
Hard times it overtook us, 
So we had to roam, 
And came here to America, 
To try and find a 
home. 
CHORUS. 
We never know no sorrow, 
For trouble we never borrow; 
And for singing or for dancing, 
We're the the neatest ever seen; 
We'll show you how they dance at home, 
Upon the moonlight green. 
(Break.) 
When we left home we bid good-bye 
To the lads and lassies dear; 
They took our hands and shook them, 
In their eyes there was a 
tear, 
Our colleens said, God bless you, 
And keep you from all harm, 
And don't forget the old folks 
You left upon the farm.

We were born in a 
little mud cabin, 
With the roof all covered with moss, 
Where the grunt of the pigs in the morning, 
Kept harmony with the old hose'. 
When a 
child we were fed upon praties, 
But now we've rose to manhood's estate, 
We 
are known on the street by each one that we meet, 
As the " Carney's," Pat and Dennis so neat. 
CHORUS. 
We come from Killarney by the lakeside, 
Where the lads and lassies on the jaunting car ride, 
We're Pat and Dennis Carney from the lakes 
of sweet Killarney, 
In the land where the apple praties grow. 
In a 
steamship we sailed 'cross the ocean, 
To better our fortunes you see, 
But divil a 
bit of luck have we had here, 
We're as wretched as wretched can be. 
We sigh for the turf-pile so cheerful, 
When barefoot we trudged it afar, 
O'er mountains and hills, .cross valleys and rills, 
In the land of sweet ‘• Erin go bragh."

Oh ! we're the brother's DobkiN and we doesn't 
care by jove, 
So long as we get three meals each day, 
We're called two blarsted Englishmen, two 
,egular crooked coves, 
It makes no odds what people think or say. 
We were born in Lancashire, our accent does 
prove queer, 
To think of those days they always make us smile; 
how the lads would dance and sing and make 
the old clogs ring, 
For they're the chaps could do it up in style. 
CHORITS. 
So to-night we took a 
notion to put our feet in motion, 
Sit up straight and listen for awhile; 
We'll endeavor to show to you, in a 
style 
that's somewhat new, 
Some clog steps in good old English style. 
Ala I 
at sparring we're two good ones, at cards 
we take the cake, 
At billiards we were never beat a 
game; 
We can row a 
boat or swim, no matter what's 
the stake, 
We're bound to win the money just the same. 
But of all the games we play to carry us away, 
And cheer our spirits up when we're feeling blue, 
Is whenever we get a 
chance tor to try a 
little dance, 
And rattle off an English step or two. Chorus.

In a 
shady little nook close beside a 
running brook, 
Far across the sea on dear old Erin's shore, 
In a 
cottage lives my love where the birds 
sing sweet above, 
And the shamrocks grow in plenty round the door, 
'Tis her pretty face is bright as the stars that 
shine at night, 
And her pleasant smile the weetest ever seen; 
She's as happy as the lark from daylight until dark, 
Oh! I 
fondly love my own, my dear colleen. 
CHORUS. 
She will gladly welcome me when her pretty face I 
see, 
For when I 
land on Erin's shore so green, 
Then the happiest hour to me in all my life will be, 
When I'm wedded to my own, my dear colleen. 
She has eyes of perfect blue, she has cheeks 
of rosy hue, 
And a 
wealth of pleasant sunbeams in her smile.; 
She has such a 
roguish face and her every 
move is grace, 
While her voice is like the song of birds the while. 
In a 
little rustic cot she shall share my happy lot, 
And the birds o'er head shall sing their joyous lay, 
And the blowers shall bloom so sweet then 
with earthly joys complete, 
We shall pass our lives in sunshine bright and gay.

Be a

Though the sky is o'ercast, it is shining somewhere,

Against this be stubborn unyielding and strong, 
But whatever He sends be it blessing or ban, 
Accept in all kindness, and bear like a

Be a

By earnest and holiest endeavor to thrive; 
If thrift follows effort, remember the poor, 
And turn not the beggar unfed from your door, 
Obey God's injunction as near as you can, 
And in every condition of life be a

Be a

Let not its temptations its struggle and strife, 
For an instant incline you to swerve from the right,

I 
have a 
daughter of great renown, 
In the ballet she dances in a 
theatre up town; 
She's a

Is this girl of mine, Biddy McGee. 
She wears tarletan skirts all covered with tin,

She waltzes and pivots so neat on her toes, 
As 'round and ' round and ' round she goes;

She high-tened wants to be, but she's Irish you see, 
And her right name is Biddy McGee.

One evening lately to the theatre I 
went, 
And while quietly viewing the show'; 
There was a 
performer who recited some lines, 
Why she done it I 
do not know. 
She came to the footlights with a 
satisfied smile, 
And said, ladies and gentlemen all; 
But the rest was too sickening for me to repeat, 
In fact I 
would not have the gall. 
'Twas a 
plea to the public that she did get off, 
And I 
thought it decidedly queer, 
To ask them on actors not to look down, 
I 
guess she was too full of beer. 
For why should the public we try to amuse, 
Despise us in the scale low; 
It's a 
thing I 
confess, I 
can't understand, 
For you must have brains on the stage to go; 
A man must have talent, genious and wit, 
And in youth must spend years at school, 
For if you remember what Shakspeare says, 
It takes a 
wise man to play the fool.

It was so very sweet; 
He said that he would like to be 
Acquainted when we'd meet. 
He called me many loving names,

Better than grandure, better than gold, 
Than rank and title a 
thousand fold 
Is a 
healthy body, a 
mind of ease. 
And simple pleasures that always please. 
A 
heatt that can feel for a 
neighbor's woe, 
And share his joys with a 
genial glow; 
With sympathie's large enough to enfold 
All men as brothers is better than gold. 
Better than gold is a 
conscience clear, 
Though toiling for bread in an humble sphere, 
Doubly blessed with content and health, 
Untried by the lust of cares or, wealth. 
Lowly living and lofty thought, 
Adorn and enoble a 
poor man's cot, 
For man and morals on nature's plan, 
Are the genuine test of a 
gentleman. 
BETTER THAN GOLD. 
Better than gold is the sweet repose 
Of the sons of toil, when their labor's close; 
Better than gold is the poor man's sleep, 
And the balm that drops on his slumbers deep, 
Bring sleeping draughts to the downy bed, 
Where luxury pillows his aching head, 
His simpler opiate labor deems. 
A 
shorter road to the land of dreams. 
Better than gold is a 
thinking mind, 
That in the realm of books can find 
A 
treasure surpassing Australian ore, 
And live with the great and good of yore. 
The sage's lore and the poet's lay, 
The glories af empires passed away, 
The world's great drama will thus unfold 
And yield a 
pleasure better tham gold. 
Better than gold is a 
peaceful home, 
Where all the fireside charities come; 
The shrine of love and the heaven of life. 
Hallowed by mother or sister or wife. 
However humble the home may be, 
Tried by sorrow with heaven's degree, 
The blessings that were never bought or sold.. 
And center there are better than gold.

That runs about our streets, 
But no one knows from whence he came, 
Or where he sleeps or eats. 
His name, his race, his business here, 
Are hidden in the fog, 
There seems to be a 
mystery 
About that yeller dog, 
And very often I 
nave stopped, 
To gaze aucl try to trace 
The mournful thoughts that seem to flit 
Across his wrinkled face. 
Perhaps he dreams of days long passed, 
When filled with pleasure's cup, 
Of days of sunshine mirth and joy, 
When he was but a 
pup. 
Enough, I 
do not really wish 
To pry in his affairs, 
Though on his breast he seems to bear 
A 
weight of heavy cares. 
His name, his voice, his business here. 
Are hidden in the fog, 
There seems to be a 
mystery 
About that yaller dog.

" 
Toss the Turk," is getting stale, 
They've laid it in the trunk, 
The latest and the greatest is, 
" 
Go sell yourself for junk." 
CHORUS. 
Stag the gilly, ain't he fly, 
He's as pious as a 
monk; 
And if I 
speak then they all cry 
Go sell yourself for junk. 
I 
wonder what they mean at all, 
By such a 
funny word, 
" 
Go sell yourself for junk," 
That's the worst I 
ever heard. 
Pipe the tarrier, stag his nibs, 
He's off his nut he's drunk; 
As I 
go by them, they all cry, 
" 
Go sell yourself for junk." 
Of course I 
have to stand it all, 
And never say a 
word; 
But still I 
do not care a 
dang, 
I'm as happy as a 
bird. 
So let the boys have their good time, 
They think I 
am a 
lunk, • 
I 
guess I'll go take their advice, 
And sell myself for junk. 
Chorus. 
The bible says the father's sin 
Descends -upon th 
son; 
And as a 
witness to its truth, 
you'll find that I 
am one. 
My pa stays out late at night, 
lie's quite a 
swell egad; 
I'm always blamed for mischief done 
fly my awful dad. 
Go where I 
will, do what I 
may, 
The people think me bad; 
I 
think I 
will go crazy through 
My very awful dad. 
Now I 
am quite a 
model youth, 
I3ut oar names are both the same, 
And that's the reason why he's fined, 
In court I 
get the blame. 
There's seven breach-of- promise suits 
11Iy parents brought on me; 
And how I 
will slip out of them, 
I 
really cannot see. 
Now if he doesn't stop his tricks, 
I'll have to leave his house, 
For when I 
think of what I 
bear, 
My manhood it does rouse. 
I 
think I'll try to get a 
wife, 
The first that can be had, 
So that I 
then can rid me of 
My very awful dad.

have a 
son named Paddy, 
He's the divil I 
swear, to go on a 
tear, 
He's as straight as a 
poplar tree. 
His mother says I'm to blame., 
For the father and son are just the same, 
And the way he goes on is a 
burning shame, 
Sure`he copies it all from me. 
CHORUS. 
/6? 
Wid a 
diamond pin in his cravat, 
His black kid gloves and stove-pipe hat; 
The cut of his hair and the likes of that, 
Sure he copies it all from me. 
He licked three men in a 
fight last week, 
And didn't they try to jail him; 
It cost me seventy dollars 
For to go and set him free. 
I 
cheerfully parted with the pelf, 
For he laid the blackguards on the shelf, 
I 
think I 
could lick the gang myself, 
And he copies it all from me. 
Chorus. 
He's an illiga,nt hand at sporting, 
To shows and balls and parties, 
He's stays all night and comes home tight 
In the morning at two or three. 
Wid mud and slush all over his clothes, 
The door he breaks in with a 
couple of blows, 
And he lights himself up to bed with his nose, 
Sure he copies his ways from me,

my best to please, 
I 
have something sweet to say in words few; 
So listen, my friends, and I 
hope you will not sneeze, 
At this something I've got to say to you. 
Ah! it's well I 
do remember how my sister 
she would laugh, 
When she sat by the fire with my aunts, 
She was giggling, and was pointing at the 
object here in view, 
'Twas this patch from my angel brother's pants. 
CHORUS. 
Treasured in my memory like a 
happy dream, 
When I 
think about my ugly aunts; 
And the only thing they left me to remember 
him above, 
Is this patch from my angel brother's pants. 
This patch was put on by my mother's feeble hands, 
It puts me in mind of better days; 
And whenever I 
look ot this patch upon those pants, 
I 
think of bow my mother used to say— 
Augustus, my loved one, do not spoil that little spot, 
For yoa know it's a 
treasure to your aunts, 
It's the only thing we've left in remembrance of him, 
Yes, that patch from your angel brother's pants.

Oh I 
I'm in love with such a

Whose ways are winning, sweet, and sure to please,

Where the mocking bird is singing in the trees.

Where the honeysuckle and magnolia's blopm; 
And the little birds are singing in the branches, 
While the balmy air is scented with perfume. 
Arm in arm we gaily wander by the streamlet, 
As we watch the rippling waters murmur by, 
While my willing arm her fairy form encircles, 
She will gaze on me with such a 
loving eye.

Where the girls are so pretty, the lads are so strong, 
And the birds sing above on the trees all day long. 
I 
left dear old Ireland this country to see, 
And came to America, the land of the free; 
My pockets were empty my heart filled with pain, 
When I 
thought that dear Erin I 
would ne'er 
see agnin.

But ru sing, I'll dance, and do all in my might, 
To please the fair colleens I

My dear little colleen, I've left far behind, 
Where'er I

still bear her in mind; 
In form she is pretty, and full of sweet grace, 
I 
long for the day when I'll see her sweet face. 
'Tis then we'll be married, and live all alone, 
In a

And as happy as larks we will be all the day.

With the girls who love on Erin's shore, 
There are none who can compare.

THE music SENT TO ANY ADDRESS ON RECEIPT OF 40ets. 
Now. since I 
appear here before you once more, 
I'll endeavor to gain your fair smile, 
Tho' years now have passed since I 
left the old shore, 
I 
still cling to the dear native isle. 
And I'll sing of old Ireland, the land of my birth. 
I 
will sing of the great men that's been, 
Whose deeds of renown shall shine round each heart 
They were great men that Ireland has seen. 
CHORDS. 
Then here's to the sons of old Et 
Go Bragh, 
May the memory of their names still be green. 
On sea, or on coast, let us drink off this toast, 
To the great men that Ireland has seen. 
O'Connell you know, as all history does show, 
\Vas a 
statesman; whose equal was few, 
At the great Parliament, he did often represent, 
That the wrongs of old Ireland were true. 
And Emmet the martyr, he fought for our cause, 
Like a 
laurel his name it keeps green, 
He died for his country and Liberty's laws, 
Those were great inen,that Ireland has seen. 
Cho. 
And then we had Sarsfield who conquered each foe, 
And never was known for to yield, 
The foeman would quake, aye, and tremble and shake, 
When his war horse would enter the field; 
And then as for poets there is no land I'm sure, 
Where such brilliant genius has been, 
There was Gratan and Lover, ant famous Tom Moore, 
Those were great men that Ireland has seen. 
Cho. 
But though those great men have now passed away, 
Old Erin shall not be alone, 
We have men that would die for their country to-day, 
And a 
parliament wish of their own; 
But may God guide and guard them to do what is right, 
May they harbor no rancor or spleen, 
But when honor demands them they valiantly fight, 
Like the great men that Ireland has seen. •

I'm a 
true-hearted boy from the green shores of Erin, 
That" Emerald " set in the sea, 
Where bounteous nature her best cloth appear in; 
And choicest of g:fts scatters free. 
Our mountains and valleys with produce abounding, 
Our rivers and takes tilled with life galore, 
Loveliest scenes on all sides there surrounding, 
The home of the shamrock, wild Ireland asthore. 
Cnonus. 
Hurrah for that bright little spot on the ocean, 
harmless around it the rude billows roar, 
True Irish hearts love with fondest devotion, 
The home of the shamrock, ould Ireland asthore. 
Dear Grannuail thy daughters are peerless, 
Fair and as fresh as the morn, 
Ever in battle thy sons they are fearless,' 
Death do they hold but in swan. 
Our hearts ever open to welcome a 
stranger, 
Those in distress never turned from the- door, 
And for our country we'll brave every danger, 
The home of the shamrock, old Ireland asthore. 
Chorus. 
I 
love the bright green, and I'm proud boys to wear it 
To it I'll ever be true, 
All loyal Irishmen that feeling share it, 
Deeply indeed as I 
do. 
Distance or climate that bond cannot sevea, 
Firm in our hearts all the wide world Well, 
The land of St. Patrick, forget it no never; 
The home of the shamrock, ould Ireland asthore.

I 
am thinking of the day when but a 
little child, 
I 
wandered o'er the meadows to the hill, 
'Where the sweet flowers grew, and forever 
growing wild. 
And the stream e'er flowed by the mill. 
But the old mill house has gone to decay, 
I 
loved it and so did darling Kate, 
And the miller he lies sleeping where the 
gentle breezes blow 
And we played 'neath the turnpike gate. 
CHORUS. 
For the turnpike gate is the pride of my heart, 
I 
loved it and so did darling Kate, 
When she sits beside me now, there's a 
smile 
upon her brow, 
That reminds me of the turnpike gate. 
And the old school house has gone to decay, 
Where the schoolmaster heard us recite, 
And those happy, happy days have faded 
from our view, 
When our little hearts were filled with delight 
And when school was out we would wander to 
the spring, 
Where I 
drew for you pictures on your slate; 
And those happy childhood days they'll come 
again no more, 
When we played on the turnpike gate.

Since Willie's left us it's so lonely, 
No more his cheery voice we hear; 
He was my darling, yes, mine only, 
For, oh! he loved his mamma dear. 
His rosy cheeks, his eyes of heavenly blue, 
The smile that round his sweet lips played. 
His curling locks of' golden hue, 
But, oh! how quickly all did fade. 
CHORUS. 
Alas! they laid him in the cold, cold grave, 
His little spirit is at rest; 
vne token of remembrance I 
have saved, 
'Tis a 
blossom from our Angel Willis's breast. 
While all around my boy were weeping, 
He lay so silent and so cold; 
It seemed that he was only sleeping, 
That soon he'd prattle as of old. 
I 
knew the parting moments were so near, 
His pale cold lips to mine I 
pressed, 
Upon his face I 
dropped a 
tear, 
And plucked this blossom from his breast. 
Chorus. 
When I 
was but a 
little child I 
used to go to school, 
And there I 
was so very good, they thought I 
was a 
fool; 
Because I 
never claimed a 
thing that didn't belong to me, 
For I 
was just as honest and as truthful as could be. 
While walking Lut tae other day by a 
police man 
I 
was stopped, 
He says young man this piece of gold just from 
your pocket dropped; 
But as I 
never carried one, and had but little coin, 
Like an honest boy I 
did reply the purse it is not mine. 
Cuora-s. 
Ico it don't belong to me, it don't belong to me, 
You had better inquire of somebody higher, 
it don't belong to me, 
I 
never saw the purse before, it can't be mine you see, 
I 
know nothing whatever about the purse, 
it don't belong to me. 
My wages being very small I 
live in humble style, 
But with the girls I 
lardy dab, among the great and fine 
I 
tell them almost anything, for I 
have plenty cheek, 
But little they think I 
do the swell upon five 
dollars a 
week. 
The other day I 
bought a 
pie, I 
placed it in my hat, 
I 
saw a 
lady on the street, I 
knew she'd stop to chat, 
My hat blew off, the pie fJ.1 out, the little boys 
laughed with glee, 
But when they brought it back I 
said it don't 
belong to me. 
Chorus. 
I 
occupy an attic room in a 
street away up town, 
And in the next there lives a 
girl her name is 
Nelly Brown, 
Whenever I 
get a 
chance to talk or pass the time away, 
I 
have a 
little gossiping in a 
quiet sort of way. 
As I 
came home the other night oh ! what a 
dreadful scene, 
The landlord rushing after me saying, Bill, 
what does tis mean, 
Miss Brown has left behind this infant as you see, 
Says T, you quite surprise me, sir, but it don't 
belong to me. 
THE TRAMP, 
BEt.,iiRD BY FRANK RUM. 
Lemme sit down a 
minute, a 
stone's got in my shoe, 
Don't you commence your cusin,' I 
ain't done 
nothin' to you; 
Yes, I'm a 
tramp. 
What of it ? 
Folks say we 
ain't no good, 
But tramps has to live, I 
reckon, though 
folks don't think that we should. 
Once I 
was strong and handsome, had plenty 
of cash and clothes, 
That was afore I 
tippled, and gin got into my nose, 
Down in the Lehigh Valley me and my people grew, 
I 
was a 
blacksmith, cap'n—and a 
good one, too; 
Me and my wife and Nellie. 
Nellie was just sixteen, 
She was the pootiest creeter the valley had ever seen. 
Beaux ? why, she had a 
dozen—had ' era from 
near and far, 
But they were mostly farmers, none of 'em suited her, 
There was a 
city stranger, young handsome, and tall, 
Dam him—I 
wish I 
had him strangled agin that wall, 
He was the man for Nellie— she didn't know no, ill; 
Mother, she tried to stop it, but you know 
a 
young gal's will, 
Well it's the same old story—common enough you'll say, 
He was a 
soft-tongued devil, and got her to run away, 
More than a 
month or after, we heard from the 
poor young thing, 
He'd gone away and left her without a 
wedding ring, 
Back to her home we brought her, back to her 
mothers side, 
Filled with a 
raging fever, she fell at my feet and died, 
Frantic with shame and trouble, her mother 
began to sink, 
Dead—in less than a 
fortnight—that's when 
I 
took to drink, 
Gimme one glass, Curnel, and then I'll be on my way, 
I'll tramp till I 
find that scoundrel, if it takes 
till Judgement Day,

The wool was growing longer and Pompey 
getting stronger,4 
Before that morn of sunshine when massa set him free; 
He used to sing with pleasure, and play the 
songs we'd treasure, 
When we were all so happy before the jubilee. 
At breakdown and at party, old romp was 
hale and hearty, 
And none could dance so nicely, the colored 
maidens said; 
But time has brought him sadness, and gone 
is all his gladness, 
Old Pompey's gettin' barefoot on the top of his head! 
CHORUS. 
The wool no more is growing, and Pompey's 
heart is knowing, 
Those joys he fondly cherished in bygone days have fled; 
The past he will remember, tho' bleak is chill December, 
Old Pompey's getting barefoot on the top of his head. 
All day he worked for massa, and at night would 
court some lassie, 
Beneath magnolia blossoms that gleamed so fair 
and white, 
Or play the banjo sweetly, while darkies clanc'd 
so fleetly, 
When fell the southern moonbeans in floods 
of mellow light; 
But those fond ties are broken, and gone each 
tender token, 
That made his heart so happy, ere bliss of life had fled, 
Now days of joy are over, for maiden and for lover, 
Old Pompey's getting barefoot on the top of his head. 
The cabin too, is lonely, for cats and owls live only 
Where Pompey once was happy before they set him free; 
The honey-suckle clambers above his silent chambers. 
But no kind hand has trained them since 
dawned the jubilee. 
'Neath southern suns the brightest, old 
Pompey's heart beat lightest, 
And sweeter was the fragrance these blooming roses shed. 
But now he wanders lonely with dreams to 
cheer him only, 
Old Pompey's gettin.' barefoot on the top of his head.

Behold the Killarney Musketeers a walking 
down Broadway, 
With bayonets brightly glistening, and the band 
so gaily play; 
They're the finest soldiers in the land, and of 
battle not afraid, 
And they show the people how they shine, 
when out on grand parade. 
See the stalwart officers, and privates in the rear, 
The captain he is urging on the men that know no fear; 
So let us join together now and give three hearty cheers, 
And raise it, too, for the boys in blue, the 
Killarney Musketeers. 
CHORUS. 
All face about, all turn around, and raise your 
muskets from the ground, 
They marched away, so light and gay, with

So let us join together now and give three hearty cheers, 
And raise it, too, for the boys in blue, the

Brannigan's Band, 
The Sixty-Ninth and Musketeers will parade 
on the grand stand. 
The ladies waving American flags, ' twill be a 
grand display, 
Mingling with the dreamy waltz, enjoying a holiday; 
With boys so true, dressed up in blue, we'll 
give three hearty cheers, 
For the best parade that ever was made by the 
Killarney Musketeers.

Why Maloney is the man.

He's well educated and toney, 
His influence is great, 
Shure he takes the cake, 
There's no such a 
man as Maloney. 
You CAR see that I'm no fighter, 
And always take things cool, 
But if the boys make fun of me. 
They'll find that I'm no fool. 
I'm up and up with every one, 
There's no better in the land, 
So if you want an honest friend. 
Then Maloney is the man.

There is a 
little fellow, who no doubt you all have seen 
And Charley is the charmer's Christian name; 
fIe dresses in the fashion, with a 
bright neck-tie 
of green, 
And to tell the truth he never looks the same. 
Ills hair he curls quite nobby, and his moustache 
waxed to kill 
He's gotten up expressly for the day; 
He stands upon the corners, but really can't keep still, 
And should you chance to meet him I 
am sure 
you'd say— 
CHORUS. 
Charley he's a 
masher, Charley he's a 
pet, 
Charley he's a 
darling, he's a 
dandy you can bet; 
He's the object of attention from all the ladies fair, 
And when he's out on promenade you should 
see them at him stare. 
He attends all the theatres, and seems perfectly at home, 
Has invitations to the parties, balls, and fairs, 
He's a 
sort of privileged character and is always 
seen alone, 
He seems to run the gauntlet everywhere, 
•Ile's polished in his manner, in a 
la-de-da sort of way, 
But how he lives I'll leave it all to you, 
•You couldn't help but notice him he always looks so gay. 
It's a 
mystery how they do it but they do.

There's a 
happy little cot down in southern Tennessee, 
Where the ivy blossoms twine round the door, 
And forever fresh and green in my memory it will be, 
Enough I 
know I'll never see it any more; 
But I 
never can forget the old home I 
love so well, 
And the many good old tunes that I 
have sung, 
And the tears they fill my eyes every time I 
try to tell 
Of the times I 
used to have when I 
was young. 
CHORUS. 
Kow the tambo and the bones, am forever laid away, 
The fiddle and the banjo am unstrung; 
But I 
often heave a 
sigh for the happy days gone by, 
And the times I 
used to have when I 
was young. 
When the autumn days had come, I 
would 
husk the yellow corn, 
In the fields I 
was singing all the day, 
ilLnd before they made me free I 
had never cause 
to mourn; 
And around the old place everything was gay; 
And many and many a 
time when the work of 
day was over, 
With my melody the old plantation rung, 
And my heart does often long for the happy 
days of yore, 
And the times I 
used to have when I 
was young. 
Now the tambo, Sra. 
PAT MAY 87 FO3LISH, 
CORRECT EDITION. 
Let cowardly slanderers say what they will, 
Against the dear land of my birth, 
But I 
will maintain she always will be, 
The grandest old spot on the earth. 
Some say with a 
sneer, we are cowards at heart, 
Fit for nothing but drinking potheen, 
But I 
throw back the villainous lie in their teeth, 
They're as brave as the shamrock is green. 
CHORUS. 
41 
Pat he may be foolish and very often wrong, 
Pat's got a 
temper that don't last very long, 
Pat is fond of jollity, as everybody knows, 
There never was a 
coward where the shamrock grows. 
If ever he weeps at the voice of distress, 
Don't blame him, his heart is too warm, 
His family over the ocean, perhaps, 
Must weather black poverty's storm. 
Don't sneer at his sorrows, or laugh at his tears, 
Assist, at least, if you can, 
Remember that Pat on many a 
field, 
Has proved that he is a 
true man. 
Chorus. 
Remmiber the Celts and the Saxons are bound, 
By the ties of pure brotherly love; 
Come test him again, and you'll find him as true 
As the stars in the heavens above. 
And always give honor where honor is due, 
Let hands join'd in friendship be seen, 
For he who despises a 
man for his name, 
Is not fit for a 
country or queen. 
Chorus.

Falls the feathery flakes of snow; 
Wearing white, and pure, a

For the fruitful earth below. 
Ere they melt, I 
leave you, mother, 
Leave for ever, this world of pain; 
For, something tells me, I 
shall never 
See the buttercups again.

In the happy days long flown,

Hands all around, boys! 
Sweet music it was play'd; 
Arrah! forward four, we welt the floor, 
At Kerrigan's Masquerade. 
At ten o'clock, precisely, 
We had to close the door; 
It was crowded to suffocation, 
And it could not hold no more. 
There was ninety-seven couples 
Round the hall did promenade--
Old Ireland was represented 
At Kerrigan's Masquerade! 
Kerrigan was dressed, I 
do declare, 
Regardless of expense, 
He waxed his moustache up with soap, 
He fairly looked immense. 
His hair was tarred with axel grease, 
He had a 
five cent shave; 
It would make you die when to waltz he tried, 
The night of the masquerade.

Who shall judge a 
man from nature, 
Who shall know him by his dress; 
Paupers may be fit for princes, 
Princes fit for something less. 
Crumpled shirt, and dirty jacket, 
May beclothe both you and me, 
So with your lot try be contented, 
As the Pebbles in the sea. 
There are springs of crystal nectar, 
Ever swelling out of stone, 
There are purple buds and golden, 
Hidden, crushed, and overgrown; 
God who counts by souls, not dresses, 
Loves and prospers you and me; 
.24 
While He values thrones the highest, 
But as Pebbles in the sea. 
There are foam embroidered oceans, 
There are little weed clad rills, 
There are feeble inch high saplings, 
There are cedars on the hills. 
God who counts by souls, not stations, 
Loves and prospers you and me, 
For to Him all vain distinctions 
Are as Pebbles in the sea. 
Truth and justice, are eternal,

Secret wrong shall never prosper, 
While there is a

Clod whose world-heard voice is singing,

Through the fields of nodding rye, 
And the brightest sunbeams glimmer,

And they never ask in vain, 
For the words of love and pity, 
From the lips of Winnie Wane.

Who is fairest of the fair, 
Go atoo-nr, the poor and lowly,

Soothing hearts that throb with pain, 
While the sunbeams fall in beauty,

I 
once did know a 
farmer, 
And he was a 
faithful Soul, 
He used to work upon his farm 
Around his country home. 
He had an only daughter, 
And to win her I 
did try, 
And when I 
asked her to be mine, 
The old man did reply. 
Cnouns. 
Treat my daughter kindly, 
And say you'll do no harm, 
And when I 
die 
leave you both, 
My little stock and farm; 
My horse, my cow, my sheep, my plow, 
My home, my pump, my barn, 
And all the little chickens in the garden. 
I 
loved this young dearly, 
And I 
thought that she loved me, 
And every evening I 
would go, 
Her lovely face to see. 
And watch her milk her father's cow, 
In it I 
saw no harm, 
And lots of fun I'd always have, 
Before I'd left the barn. 
Her father has consented, 
And we two will married be; 
We'll own our little country home, 
And live in harmony. 
No sorrow seems to hover o'er 
Our little cottage home, 
For all is blithe and happiness, 
Although we live alone.

Set the old man drunk, and we'll have some fun. 
_Last Sunday when I 
came from mass, 
Ile asked me over to have a

drop of gin, 
Says he, drink it down, and I'll fill them again.

song of an Irish warrior, 
When one fellow says where did you catch the 
Says he, now, crack it light every one, 
I'm setting him drunk for to have some fun. 
He pulled out his fist and hit me a 
poke, 
By the powers I 
thought my neck was broke, 
And he ran me up against the wall, 
To give me a 
GreacoRoman fall. 
he comes to the house next Sunday night 
I 
will fire him down a 
a 
couple of flight, 
And get the police to give him a 
run, 
For setting me drunk to have some flak.

We never can contented be, 
With our own lot in life; 
We've always trouble on our mind, 
Some new born care or strife. 
Why not travel through the world 
With sunshine on your brow, 
For you'll never know the difference 
In a 
thousand years from now. 
CHORUS. 
Don't try to read the future, then, 
For this, and that, and how; 
For you'll never know the difference, 
In a 
thousand years from now. 
'Twon't do to be too proud these days, 
Because you have your wealth; 
You may some time the wrong man meet, 
And thereby lose your health. 
Don't scorn to earn your living, 
By the hoe, the spade, or plow; 
• 
For you'll never know the difference 
In a 
thousand years from now. 
Chorus. 
Because your parents are well off, 
Don't scorn to learn a 
trade; 
Remember when the sun is warm, 
You can't always find the shade. 
Don't scorn to do a 
little work, 
Though sweat adorn your brow, 
For you'll never know the difference 
In a 
thousand years from now. 
Chorus. 
SUNG BY WALTER MACK. 
In a 
boarding-housh across the staeet, 
Where all the Hungry actors eat; 
At noon they open wide their gash, 
To pulverize the beef and hash. 
At noon they all get out of bed, 
And rush down stairs for to be fed, 
They clean the table as slick as a 
mouse, 
In the hungry, starving boarding-house. 
CHORUS. 
Nobody knows what the boarders eat, 
No remarks about the meat; 
Please keep mum and hold your mouth, 
In the Hungry, starving, boarding-house. 
The cook sleeris on the second floor, 
With a 
paniocic hitched to every door, 
So as the boarders can't get in. 
Now where is Mose when they douse the glim. 
The actors all sleep in the attic, 
And all night long they raise a 
racket, 
They give the chambermaids the run, 
And chase them wit) l 
a 
gatling gun. 
Chorus. 
The other night an actor skipped, 
And out of the window he lowered, 
lie lowered himself down with a 
rope, 
And for a 
freight train did elope. 
The landlord bless his darling soul 
In the morning called the roll, 
His daughter screamed and cried. oh! Lord, 
lie has given us the sneak for three weeks board.

As through life we journey onward, 
, Queer sayings one hears, when traveling about; 
Some are odd, peculiar expressions, 
As " Put away the cradle baby's out." 
So now with your kind attention, 
I'll sing of the latest one to you; 
One that's sure to catch the fancy, 
And also become a 
popular one, too. 
Spoken.—You have heard all the expressions, 
" 
You're too fresh," " You're too new," etc, but 
the latest is— 
CHORUS. 
•' Tie him up, my friend," tie him up, 
Tie him up, now mind what I 
say; 
You'll be sorry when you're sober, 
And your little spree is over, 
Tie him up, without any delay. 
This world is composed of all sorts of people, 
Who occupy different stations in life, 
The rich and the poor are mingled together, 
A 
living to gain in this sea of strife. 
It matters not where fortune may bring you, 
Slang phrases one hears from day to day; 
The old and the young the same it both please, 
As " I 
should remark," and " Nay, Gussie, nay.* 
Spoken—Yes, one hears some very odd, peculiar 
expressions through travelling about, but I 
think 
the latest aid the best one is— 
Chorus. 
I've a 
nice little cabin that's built with mud, 
In the beautiful County Kildare, 
I've got acres of land, and men at command, 
And I 
have always a 
shilling to spare. 
Och ! I 
didn't come here, boys, in search of a 
job, 
But just a 
short visit to pay, 
And as I 
walk through the streets, people say 
that I 
meet, 
There's the man you don't meet every day. 
CHORUS. 
Then call for your glasses, just have what you want, 
And whatever the damage I'll pay; 
Dhoys be airy and free when you're drinking wid me, 
For I'm the man you don't meet every day. 
When I 
landed in Glasgow, what a 
sight met 
my eyes, 
As I 
first put my foot on the shore; 
There was Felix O'Donough, blind Barney McGurk, 
o. 
And a 
round two or three dozen more. 
°eh! tuurther! you ought to have seen them 
all stare, 
And then they did all run away; 
Says I, •` my spalpeens, do you think I'm a 
ghost, 
Because I'm a 
man you don't meet every day. 
Chorus. 
I'm in love with a 
nice little girl in town, 
And we're going to be married to-day, 
And if you come over a 
twelVernouth from now, 
A 
right welcome to all I 
will pay. 
And I 
think I 
can show you a 
little spalpeen, 
Who then will be able to say— 
To my friends round about, while yointin,g me out, 
There's the man you don't meet every day.

I 
like hoLest pluck in this warfare of life, 
No matter whoever I 
meet; 
I 
like a 
man boldly to say what he thinks, 
4i 
And not fill me with hollow deceit. 
It may not be pleasant at all times to hear 
The truth plainly told in your ear; 
Yet, 'tis better to know you're prepared for the worst, 
Than tremble like children with fear. 
CHOR17S. 
I 
do like a 
man that will boldly stand up, 
And tell me at once what he feels, 
I 
can fight with the lion t
.hat roars in my face, 
But I 
can't bear a 
cur at my heels.

like to be told of my faults like a 
man, 
And I 
ne'er knew the man who had none; 
Hard words may be.used, but I 
like him the most, 
Who has pluck all my faults to make known. 
If wrong I 
can cure the foul slander ot once, 
And destroy every venomous part; 
Yet I 
reel, when a 
Judas, who smiles in my face, 
Gives a 
stab at my back in the dark. 
Chorus. 
So behind a 
man's back always mind what you say, 
If you can't do him no good, do him no harm; 
If you don't like backbiting, don't do it yourself, 
And your good name will spread like a 
charm 
We all have to live, so let's try and make life 
A 
good open field for the race, 
And if you have cause of complaint 'gainst a 
man, 
Go tell him rigbt straight to his face.

I've been dreaming, oh ! yes, I've been dreaming, 
Of things that occur every day; 
I've been dreaming of people who worry, 
And plod through the world in dismay. 
They grumble at all that's around them, 
And snarl like a 
cur in the street, 
While if you attempt to approach them, 
They'll squirm like the snake at your feet. 
CHORUS. 
This world is as good as they make them, 
But snarlers I 
say, we must " shake" them, 
For no matter what way you may take them, 
They'll worry and grumble the same. 
I've been dreaming, oh! yes, I've been dreaming 
Of women who try to do well. 
But are always abused by their husbands, 
For failings too numerous to tell. 
If victuals ain't cooked right to suit them, 
They'll curse everything in the land; 
And if the poor woman disputes them, 
She feels the effect of a 
hand. 
Chorus. 
I've been dreaming, oh! yes, I've been dreaming, 
Of days in the future I 
see; 
When acts of the present will vanish, 
And all will be happy and free. 
As things at this time are progressing, 
A 
change for the better, we r.eed, 
For now it is really distressing, 
To look on each dastardly deed. 
Chorus.
