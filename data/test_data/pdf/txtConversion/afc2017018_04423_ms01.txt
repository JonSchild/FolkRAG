I: 
All right. Are we ready? 
I2: 
Yep. 
I: 
Great. We’ll start. I’m going to first of all say thank you so much for the work that you do, and for 
agreeing to this interview. 
P: 
Oh, yeah. No problem [laughs]. 
I: 
Really appreciate it. We’re excited about hearing your stories, and I’m going to jump right in and ask 
you to tell us your story. How long have you been doing this? How you got into personal care assistant work, 
and why? 
P: 
Okay. Well, when I was a teenager, my grandfather—I had one grandfather on my mom’s side that 
was—actually, took care of dementia patients. Volunteered at an Alzheimer’s sort of day center, and I had 
another grandfather that had Alzheimer’s, and so that was an interesting dynamic for me to see those two, and 
to be exposed to both dynamics. And my grandfather that had Alzheimer’s had it for about 5 years and then he 
passed away when I was about 17-18, and so I [84.20]—my heart was already kind of into that sort of thing 
around that time, and I took care of my grandmother when she got cancer, too, for the last summer that she 
was around in ’96. So, that kinda brought me the interest there, and then my former sister-in-law, she is the 
one that got me into health care, and being sort of an aide, and I started out in, actually, homes. And then I 
went into long-term care later, and then to assisted living. In about 2003 I started, so 15 years or so? Yeah. It’s 
weird to say, but yeah. It’s been about that long. 
I: 
And then before we actually started the interview, you were telling us about your mother.  
P: 
Yes. My mother came to live with me in 2007. I had already been an aide for quite some time, about 4 
years, and I had, actually, already received quite a bit of dementia training at this point, and started out on a 
dementia unit, which is kind of ironic, but somehow, I think it was all a big set up, if you will. Settin’ me up for 
what was comin’ next. I took care of—she actually just started out living with me, and then just slowly but 
surely we started noticing things. Her driving was off, and her—just different things about her was off, and it got 
to the point where it got so bad we got her diagnosed in 2011, and that was when everything came to surface 
about her frontal temporal dementia—is what it’s called. It is not Alzheimer’s. It does not appear—in 
appearance it is different completely from Alzheimer’s jut in the way it—she’s had it for over 10 years, and she 
still knows who I am to this day. Every time I walk in to see her, she’s smiling; she knows who I am. She’s very 
happy to see me. She’s not very verbal, and I think that’s where they say the dementia comes in there, but 
yeah, she’s in a nursing home now, but for 7 years I cared for her at home, and then had to make that kinda 
difficult decision to place her into an AFC Home, and then long-term care [81.49]. 
I: 
So, you actually come to this interview from both perspectives—as a family member who was providing 
care— 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
And a paid caregiver who provides care to other people’s family. 
P: 
Yes. Yes. Very interesting dynamic there [laughs]. 
I: 
Well, do you want to say something about that—the two different perspectives? 
P: 
Yes. I will definitely say that as a healthcare worker I underestimated the family side. You know, we, as 
healthcare workers I think we have a certain perspective, and we don’t necessarily know the people we come 
into contact with so personally, and it’s hard to sort of wrap your mind around trying to get that person-centered 
care down when you’re not a family member. And I think that’s an interesting dynamic, but I also think that as a 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018

family member, for me, it’s easier for me to come to a place of understanding when I’m watching the caregivers 
with my mom and watching how her care works because I know the life of a caregiver [laughs], and I know how 
crazy a job it can be. And so, I try to be, you know, I try to be pretty lenient in the things that I pick about or 
whatever, you know. And try to be pretty understanding about that, and yeah. 
I: 
You had mentioned earlier that you’ve done caregiving for a long time for pay, but you had no idea 
when you started taking care of your mother, you know, it’s totally different when it’s a family member. 
P: 
It is. Yes, it is. It’s just that you realize how much more patience you need with, you know, and day-to-
day how much it takes just to do that, you know. For my mom it got to where I was going to school, taking care 
of three kids [79.46], trying to go to work at a nursing home, and then take care of my mother on top of that. 
And I was working third shift at the nursing home, going to school during the day, so in between work and 
school I would get my mom ready for the day, and then I would go and do my stuff, and then—it was crazy 
[laughs]. It broke my body down, so I had to eventually stop doing all that and change my focus a little bit, but it 
was hard because being in the caregiver world, and seeing all that comes with that, it was a difficult decision to 
put her there. So, I’m very—I tend to be a very compassionate person, and I don’t like when I see things go 
wrong in the sense of people being mistreated and things like that. So, I had a hard time kind of getting over 
that idea of maybe that possibility. 
I: 
You mentioned person-centered care, how do you define that? 
P: 
Well, really, for me it’s, you know, especially right now, you know, when I walk into a client’s home I 
never know what to expect. So, when I go in there and I sit down, you know, and introduce myself the first 
thing I do is start asking them questions, you know. What kinda things do you like me to do here? What kind of 
things are you comfortable with me doing? What do you not want me to do? Are there areas of the house you 
don’t want me—things like that? Because those are the things—because it always revolves around the client 
and their wishes, not mine. You know, I can’t come into somebody’s house and tell them what I’m gonna do. 
You know, and to me that doesn’t sound fair or seem fair. You know, so I try to always accommodate that 
person that I’m caring for in regards to—well, if you don’t want to shower today, you don’t have to have a 
shower today. That’s fine. You know, if you’d rather have a bath than a shower, then we’ll do a bath. You 
know, however crazy or little their need may be, fill it. You know, a glass a water. You know, sometimes when 
they think, or well this person can go get up and go get a glass a water. Well, if I’m here to do it, why not I just 
do it, you know?  I guess you could say that’s what we get paid to do, even though it’s little minute things. 
I: 
So, you work for an agency? 
P: 
I do. Yes. 
I: 
Just one in particular? You don’t need to name it if you don’t want to. 
P: 
No. I do work for just one. Yes. 
I: 
So, when you go out to the client’s home they give you a sheet of paper that says something about that 
person? 
P: 
Yup. It gives you a general gist of what care they need [76.56] as far as whether or not they need 
personal care or just maybe like housekeeping. It can go as light, you know, it’s as light as light housekeeping. 
That’s the one end of the spectrum. The other end of the spectrum is getting somebody out of a wheelchair 
with a Hoyer lift and putting them into a bed, and all the personal care that comes with that. You know, 
showers and whatever. Whatever it may entail. I mean I do help people with showers, and I do help people 
with, you know, going to the bathroom or whatever. So, whatever their needs might be.

I: 
So, you mentioned earlier training. Can you—what kind of training have you had, and what do you see 
the role of training as? 
P: 
Well, in home care it’s a lot different I feel like than in the nursing world—when I was there. But I think 
the whole idea of the trainings in general are changing because we’re going to a technological world, so where 
now a lot of that’s online. I used to get a lot of that hands-on. I don’t know that I’d say one’s better than the 
other, but I do think that the dementia training has come a long way. I like the dementia training that’s out 
there. I think it needs to get more in depth with maybe with the different kinds—the different types of dementia 
because they all do present themselves so differently. Vascular dementia, frontal temporal dementia, 
Alzheimer’s, you know, those are three very different types of dementia, and understanding that and not 
grouping them all together I think is really important, and sometimes I think we do that. We kinda lump it all into 
Alzheimer’s. 
I: 
And you mentioned the Hoyer lift, and so, yeah, a number of certain kinds of skilled tasks that you do. 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
That you must have received some training for. 
P: 
Oh, yeah. We get all kinds of training—transfers—training on transfers, training on how to feed people, 
training on how to, you know, everything from catheters to how to change somebody’s brief, to just basically all 
kinds of care [74.31] related training, I guess is what I’d call it. Care-related training, [laughs] so yeah. 
I: 
So, 15 years—you had a lot of clients over the years. 
P: 
Oh, yes [laughs]. 
I: 
You’ve probably had some favorites. 
P: 
Yes. Yes. Yes. One lady that comes to my mind in particular, her name was L. I took care of her in a 
nursing home, and she’s a very good example of some of the things that are wrong with—her story is a good 
example of some of the things that have gone wrong in our system. She was a woman who had muscular 
dystrophy I believe, and when I first moved down this way and started working in a nursing home, she was one 
of my clients, and she—her care was very involved. It was a 45-minute routine at night. I don’t know what it 
was during the day ‘cause I didn’t take care of her during the day, but I worked second shift. And 9 times outta 
10 the aides were either allergic to her cat that she had in her room. And I say allergic [laughing] quotations, to 
her cat or there was some other reason they couldn’t be in there. And, personally, I knew that some of these 
people just didn’t wanna go there and do her routine because it was so lengthy, and it took so long, and she 
had things that she wanted done a certain way. And this is what I’m talkin’ about, too, with the person-centered 
care. Some people’s care needs are just beyond our limits in our mind, you know tell us they should be. Like, 
you know, for example she would set her elbows up on her wheelchair, and she couldn’t always keep ‘em up, 
so sometimes I’d have to move her elbow, and I’d have to move her arm a little bit to give her a little bit a 
breathing room, I guess, or she couldn’t do that on her own. Well, a lotta people thought, “She can do it on her 
own. She’s just not doing it.” Just little things like that. You get a lotta attitude from other caregivers sometimes. 
“You know, well, this person isn’t—should be in this state of mind,” and “This person’s not really this way.” You 
see a lot of that [72.15], you know, in the healthcare field, and it puts a bad taste in my mouth because we 
don’t know what’s going through the mind of that client. We don’t know what’s really going through the heart of 
that client either. You know, and what’s really going on inside of them, and when we’re telling them, well, you 
should be able to do this, or you should be able to do that, that’s not right. That’s not our place to do. We’re just 
there—if that’s what they ask us to do, that’s what we should just be doing.

I: 
So, help us educate people who don’t know what you do. You know there are a lot of people that just 
really don’t understand what personal care assistants do for a living, what you do for somebody, so maybe you 
could walk us through her case, for example. Forty-five minutes—what would you do during that 45 minutes? 
P: 
Well, it usually just started out where, you know, she was in a wheelchair, so I would take her down to 
the bathroom, and use a Hoyer, which is a lift that you use to transfer people. Sometimes you have an 
electronic one. Sometimes it’s a manual one, and that depends on the day. Sometimes they’re feisty [laughs]. 
Anyway, you use that and get her on the toilet. She had a particular way of getting washed up that she liked, a 
particular way or just all the moving—moving her around and doing all these things. Everything took time, you 
know. It may take you 5, 10 minutes to get her from the chair to the toilet, and then, you know, you’ve gotta 
wait for her to go, and then you’ve gotta, you know—and through all this time you’ve kinda gotta stay in the 
room because you can’t leave her alone, you know. And then just the little tedious things. Once you get her 
into the room, get her into the bed. So, you’ve gotta Hoyer transfer her from the toilet back to the chair, and 
then back from the chair to the bed. So, it just gets tedious, you know, and it does. And there’s—if she wanted 
to eat something or get something to drink, you know, you give her that. And sometimes you’ve gotta feed 
people, and other times, you know, you can just hand it to ‘em or whatever. But it really depends on the person 
[69.47], you know, as to how. But, yeah, you can just imagine just trying to take 5, 10 minutes to do each thing, 
how that could definitely add up. 
I: 
So, it’s interesting though that you say, a number of caregivers kind of avoided taking care of her for 
different reasons, but yet you referred to her as one of your favorites. 
P: 
Yes. I connected with her—actually, I didn’t connect with her right away, funny thing, is she sorta didn’t 
know what to make of me when I came in because I think she had been going this route with these aides for so 
long that she was kinda feeling like everybody was gonna be that way. And so, she was kinda cold-shoulderin’ 
me the first couple times I took care of her, and I started noticing the trend, and so one day when I went in her 
room I said something to her about it. I kinda broke down the wall, and I said, look I just want you to know I’m 
not like these other people. I really am here to, you know, care for your needs and tend to your needs, and 
honestly, after we broke that wall down, we got to be like really good friends [laughs]. You know, she got me 
reading my Bible again. She started reading to me out of her Bible. She asked me if it was okay, and it was 
something I hadn’t been exposed to in quite some number of years, and something I was missing, and so, 
yeah. And she was literally like my friend—best friend when I first moved down here, and I would spend 
sometimes lunch breaks in her room, and sometimes I just came on my own time, and [laughing] yeah, it was 
very fun. She just made life—she just made me look at life in a different way. She was 41-years-old. They told 
her she wouldn’t make it past the age of 3, so that’s pretty amazing. 
I: 
And how long ago did she pass away? 
P: 
She passed away in 2008 or ’09 maybe. 
I: 
How did that hit you? 
P: 
At that point I was pretty—death has kind of surrounded me a lot in my life, anyways, on a personal 
level. So, work level it was always a little bit easier for me to handle, but with her case, we kinda both made 
peace about it before she passed. We talked about it. We knew it was comin’. It was one of those things where 
she was kinda like, “Well, I’ll see ya in heaven.” You know, and that’s kinda the way it was, and I didn’t really 
take it that hard. I went to her funeral, and paid my respects, and I don’t always do that. You know, I don’t 
always go to my clients’ funerals and stuff, but there have been certain ones I have made it a point to do that 
[66.54] with. And you know, you get to know the family members of these people, too, and they grow to 
appreciate you as a person, and they see when you put effort in and when you don’t. And they know the good 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Jennifer Lugo. Grand Rapids. 6.9.18

ones, and they know who’s not doing the right thing. So, you know, you should always—as a caregiver you 
should always have that in the back of your mind, too, you know. 
I: 
So, she required quite a bit of care—high-level care, and then you have clients let’s say in their own 
homes that don’t need that much, maybe? 
P: 
Right. 
I: 
And you come in, and— 
P: 
Yeah [laughing]— 
I: 
Can you tell us about what that’s like? 
P: 
Oh, yeah. I have one recent case that I go into her home, and she’s not very far from me, but it’s so 
funny because every time I go in there she’s, “I don’t know why you’re here. I really don’t need you here. My 
kids probably sent you in here, and I just—there’s not really much for you to do,” Even though you can look 
around and you can see that the floor hasn’t been swept, and you can see that the bathroom needs to be 
wiped down, and you can see the different things that you should be doing. And it’s a hard thing, for me 
especially, not to just wanna jump up and start doing that stuff, but it’s also her house, and I don’t want to 
disrespect her by just startin’ to do all that. So, I’ve kinda been warmin’ up to her a little more, and just trying to 
ease into it. The first day I just told her, well, maybe your bathroom could just use wiping down a little bit, you 
know? Maybe I can just go in there and wipe things down, and that’ll be about it for the day, you know. And 
then I kept it [65.15] real simple, and then she was find with that. And the next day I went in there she was 
okay with me sweeping, and she was okay with me doin’ the dishes, and wipin’ down the counters. So, you 
kinda have to watch what you’re doing as far as that goes because you don’t want somebody to get upset with 
you, you know, that you’re in their house, and that you’re trying to take over. You don’t want them to think that 
you’re trying to take over there life, you know. So, it’s kind of a hard dynamic, but just I think even just—a lotta 
the times I find even if somebody doesn’t feel that you’re necessarily needed there, they really like the 
company, you know, and I haven’t had one person yet deny my company, so [laughing] that’s a good thing. 
I: 
It sounds like a lot of it is intention on building a relationship and some trust. 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
And sort of easing into things a little— 
P: 
Yes. Yes. And you have—you know, I do have clients where the first day I was in there I had to do their 
personal cares and stuff like that, and that’s, you know, on the side of—from the perspective of a person that 
has to have this done, I can’t imagine what that would be like. You know, to have a different face come in, you 
know, ‘cause we talk about the shortage of—there’s a shortage in homecare. You know, and that person 
sometimes may get the same aide, may not get the same aide, you know, in the morning you got one, and at 
night you got another one, and the next day you got another one. Just to have all these—it’s like a revolving 
door, so to speak, and for some of these people that’s gotta be an interesting dynamic, too. You know, to allow 
all these different kinds of people into your home, and you don’t know which ones you can trust and which 
ones you can’t ‘cause you’re relying on somebody else’s input, you know. 
I: 
So, you’ve had—we’re going to take a break in just a moment, but maybe you could tell one more story. 
You’ve had a number of favorite client’s over the years. 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
Can you think of somebody that was maybe not one of your favorites? Anybody?

P: 
Yeah. I had a lady jump out a window once [laughing]. 
I: 
That’s a story you could share. Do we have time for that story? 
I2: 
Yeah. 
P: 
She had renal failure, and this again, was when I was workin’ in a home—nursing home—but she had 
renal failure. I worked third shift. She should have been on a 15-minute check, and she wasn’t. I guess I wasn’t 
really aware of how many times that she had tried to escape that particular facility, but she had tried to escape 
quite a few times. And I was her aide that night, and we were supposed to do our 12 o’clock rounds, and I had 
checked on her a couple a times before midnight, but I didn’t check on her—I wasn’t checking on her every 15 
minutes, and when I went into her room at midnight I thought—the door to the bathroom was closed and the 
light was on. So, I checked her roommate, and I saw her room was there, and I figured she was in the 
bathroom. And then I walked out and checked—did the rest of my checks, and when I went back in there to 
make sure she was there, the bathroom light was still on, and I thought, well, that’s a little funny. And then I 
saw the curtain kinda blowing out, and I’m like wait a minute. Somethin’ doesn’t feel right here. So, I knocked 
on the bathroom door, and I got no answer. And then I went over to the window, and I pulled the curtain aside 
and the screen fell down [laughs]. And I’m like uh-oh. We have a problem [laughs], so I ran and got the nurse, 
and I told the nurse. We had a code, you know, code green or something like that for a missing persons—you 
gotta go in, you gotta check all the rooms, you gotta check all the bathrooms, you gotta check all the closets, 
check the whole entire building. Essentially, everybody has to do that, and basically stop what they’re doing 
and—we didn’t find her actually until the morning. And they found her in the back of a pickup truck on a side 
road just about a half a mile from where we were, and she had broken her ankle and then gone to the—they 
had taken her to emergency room when they found her, and she wound up passing within a week, and her 
whole thing was she just didn’t wanna die there. That was really all it came down to, and so, yeah. I thought I 
was gonna lose my job [laughing] 
I: 
That wasn’t one of your better days. 
P: 
No [laughing]. I was quite—I was really more fearful about her than losing my job, but you know when 
the state came in to get me, then I was a little bit fearful [laughing] of losing my job. 
I: 
Yes. That would be scary. So, we’ll take a pause here. I’ll let this continue, but so just out of curiosity, 
how many floors up was she [laughing]? 
P: 
We were only on the first-floor building, fortunately, which was the way she was able to get out so 
easily. I couldn’t tell you, actually, how she even got out ‘cause I didn’t think those windows opened so easily 
[59.53] [laughing] 
I: 
Yeah. And did she have dementia? 
P: 
She didn’t. She had renal failure. 
I: 
Renal failure. 
P: 
Yeah. And she was end-stage renal failure, so, yeah. I had another incident where—this one was really 
more to do with staff issues than it was the actual person. I had a lady that was—they had told me she was 
sick, and that she had maybe a flu or something, and so to keep an eye on her through the night, and I was 
workin’ third shift. And in the morning, we usually had about four or five people we had to get dressed. We 
didn’t necessarily have to get ‘em up, but we had to get ‘em dressed. And then so, this was one of my people 
that I had to do that with, and I had been goin’ in there frequently throughout the night and checkin’ her, and 
she seemed okay until about 6 o’clock in the morning when I went in there to dress her and started movin’ her 
around and her breathing got a little funny, and then all of a sudden, she stopped. And I’m like uh-oh, so I went 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Jennifer Lugo. Grand Rapids. 6.9.18 
 
6
and got the nurse, and put the call light on, and I didn’t wanna wait too long when the call light was on because 
she had stopped breathing, so I—not knowing what to do, I had went down and get the nurse probably 
knowing I shouldn’t have left her, but not, you know, really feeling like I was between a rock and a hard place. 
So, I got the nurse trying to explain to her you gotta kinda hurry up, you know, we gotta get down here, and 
she’s not doing well. And I don’t know that the nurse necessarily caught my drift ‘cause she wasn’t moving the 
fastest, and so I get down to the room, and trying to figure out what to do for her, and stuff, and the nurse 
comes down and she says, “Oh, we’ve gotta go get the backboard for CPR, ‘cause we’ve gotta start CPR on 
her.” And of course, at that point, I didn’t have my certification up to date. If ever I have regretted that in my life, 
it was at that moment because—and I have never ever since then let it lapse [laughing] because after that—
the two nurses that jumped onboard to do the CPR didn’t exactly know what they were doing and weren’t doing 
it properly. And she was at first trying to get her—do the CPR with her on the bed, and you can’t do that with a 
person on the bed. And so, you have to at least get’ em—take the sheet and get ‘em to the floor or use the 
backboard. And the other nurse had told me, “Go get the backboard.” So, I got the backboard [57.17], and I’m 
watching these two nurses, and I’m just in my mind I’m just crazy because I know I know how to do this. I know 
I could be steppin’ in here, but I know I’m not certified, so the lady wound up passing away which probably was 
inevitable anyways. But I couldn’t help but feel like there was a lotta things in that situation that coulda gone 
differently that—and so it’s hard ‘cause you have to—you have to work with people, and you don’t always know 
what they’re going to react like either. 
I: 
Right. It’s a great illustration though of— 
I2: 
I’m gonna stop here. 
I: 
Okay. 
I2: 
I loaded things up after you were already into it, and I was like man that was good. 
P: 
Augh [laughs]. 
I: 
We’re gonna circle back ‘cause I know— 
I2: 
One second, one second, one second. This is just starting. Okay.  
I: 
So, you just told a remarkable story about—and this was in a nursing home about a resident who 
stopped breathing and the nurses were doing CPR, and you felt like there were a number of things that could 
have gone differently, and the outcome might have been a little bit different. And I think that was an amazing 
illustration of the pivotal role of that one person, that one PCA can play in, you know, a good outcome [55.44] 
or a not so good outcome.  
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
It’s such a pivotal position. 
P: 
It is. It is. A few seconds can be the difference between life and death with a person, and you don’t 
really understand that until you kinda get into the work, and you really understand it. And I think a lotta people 
drop off when they have somebody that passes away. You know or getting into things that they didn’t really 
think about, you know, having to take somebody to the bathroom and they have an explosion, and then they’re 
like, “Oh, my, goodness. I can’t handle this,” and that realization kinda hitting you in the face. It’s easy to think 
about when you are sitting in a chair thinkin’ about it, but it’s a lot different when you walk into a situation, and 
you don’t know what you’re gonna walk into. One thing I can say about home care and the training in home 
care is I do not like the fact that you do not have to be a certified nursing assistant [54.45] to do that job. I feel 
like you should at least have that credential on your record in order to walk into somebody’s house because 
you’re dealing with people who you never know at what point something may happen to them. So, you know, 9

times outta 10 when I take on a client and I’m given a sheet that has their diagnoses on it, and there’s two, 
three, four, five, sometimes more diagnoses. So, if you’re talkin’ about people with COPD and people with 
congestive heart failure and, you know, somebody that’s on oxygen, there are certain procedures you should 
know as a certified nursing assistant to be able to take care of those things. Oxygen, you know, taking care of 
an oxygen tank, using a back-up oxygen tank, those are things we learn as a certified nursing assistant that—
Hoyer training. Now, they do offer Hoyer training at home care facilities, but you get 1 hour training a month in 
a home care—at least through my home care company. I get 1 hour of training a month, which means for 6 
months I may not get training on transfers, but I’m transferring people in that 6 months [53.31]. You see what I 
mean? So, it’s kind of a tricky situation I think for people that aren’t trained, and it’s kinda hard to think about 
somebody just walkin’ in off the street and doin’ that job. 
I: 
Especially when it’s a pivotal one like what we were just talking about. 
P: 
Right. Right.  
I: 
So, you’ve used a couple of examples from nursing homes where a situation’s come up and you felt 
you needed help, so you went, and you got a nurse. And you had backup help. You don’t have that in-home 
care.  
P: 
No. You don’t [laughs]. 
I: 
So, if a situation comes up, what do you do? 
P: 
Well, I’ve had situations come up where I’ve had to call 911. I’ve had situations come up where I’ve just 
had to call the family member. It kinda depends on how deep it gets, I guess, so to speak. If it’s any kind of like 
cardiac or breathing problem, you know, of course, you’re gonna call 911 right away. And then you go ahead 
and proceed to call the family and your company and all that stuff, but you call, you know, your company is the 
one that you rely on to report things to. You know, if I see a new bruise or something on somebody, then I 
report it to my company. You know, that kinda thing. We do have a nurse through our company that comes out 
and checks on that person, so they’re not completely without that element. But it is definitely different than 
having somebody down the hallway. 
I: 
So, have you ever walked in to a situation or had a situation that you didn’t know how to handle? That 
you felt like this is way over my skill level? 
P: 
[Laughs] the only time I did was actually a situation where it really wasn’t the—it was the environment 
that bothered me. It wasn’t the person, and it wasn’t my company. It was—I walked into a house and they had 
animals, and lots of them, and they used the bathroom in the house, and it was very evident when you walked 
in the door, and it was almost like you [51.12] really should have had a mask on your face when you walked in. 
And I was not prepared for that, and they were not very clean people. As a matter of fact, I kind of had 
[laughs]—I kinda had an issue where I wound up calling Adult Protective Services because I had been to this 
house several times, and the first time I was there I spent 4 hours in the kitchen, which is, you know, in my 
mind I thought, well, maybe if I do this, and I do a really good job it’s going to—and maybe they’ll feel like, oh, I 
can keep this up now. And that was my thought process. I didn’t think, oh, this is disgusting, dah, dah, dah, 
dah, dah. I didn’t try to go there in my mind ‘cause I wanted to do the best thing I could do for them. So, I had 
this whole elaborate routine I went through and did all this stuff, and I came back a couple days later, and it 
was practically just as bad as the first time I walked in. So, I thought, well, they’re not keeping it up, and they 
don’t seem like they’re going to. So, I kind of, you know, mentioned some things about, well, maybe this would 
be a good idea, and maybe that would be a good idea. Not to step on their toes or, you know, imply that they 
have to, but just to throw it out there, you know. Well, maybe this, you know, maybe organizing over here 
would be a really good idea. Just little things like that, and the woman I was taking care of—it really wasn’t her 
fault, which made me feel worse [49.38] because her daughter lived there. And then it got to feeling like, well, it 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Jennifer Lugo. Grand Rapids. 6.9.18

almost makes you wonder in your mind is this person taking advantage of the other because they’re not really 
caring for them, but you know you know that money’s comin’ into that household, and then it—so, in your mind 
it’s that dynamic of trying to be an objective caregiver and your humanity [laughs]. But I did wind up calling 
Adult Protective Services. I reported it to my company, and my company did the same thing. However, what I 
didn’t realize was when I reported it to my company and they didn’t respond to me that they were gonna do 
that, I just took it as they weren’t gonna do anything. So, I kind of misrepresented them in, you know, a little bit 
because they did actually call APS after that, but APS had been in that house several occasions, and what 
they essentially told me was we cannot do anything in the situation where this is the way somebody wants to 
live. If this is the way that somebody chooses to live as an adult, we can’t do anything about that. And it’s 
heartbreaking, it’s really difficult to see and to think that there may be a lot of other people that are living in 
those same conditions because in my mind I’m like if they would just get her outta here and into a facility, she 
would actually be better off. Her breathing would be that much better off. I mean just things like that, like her 
breathing was in jeopardy because of all that animal feces that was in that house. And, you know, it’s hard 
knowing your boundaries, and of course, my company came back to me and I’m like, oh, I called APS 
[laughing], and I’m like, oh, oops. Should I have not done that, like we took care of it? And I was like, oh. So, 
you know, we had to sort of—they kinda, you know, looked at me like [laughing], but they didn’t get upset with 
me [47.22]. You know, they didn’t get upset with me. They understood why I did what I did, so that was good 
too because I didn’t have that problem. 
I: 
So, what’s the ending of that story? Did APS—they weren’t able to do anything, and— 
P: 
Nope. My home care company actually pulled out of that because they felt like it was not a safe 
environment to put their workers in. 
I: 
Well, that was my next question. Since that story, have there been any times when you didn’t feel safe? 
P: 
Not, in home care. Really, I’ve had a pretty good run of it in home care. I’ve been doin’ it for a little over 
a year—about a year and a half now. I generally like the people that I’ve dealt with. 
I: 
Good. 
I2: 
I have a question. I want to go back to your last story of you calling APS, and then calling the care 
company, how do you balance what you think should happen for a person’s care because you’re so intimately 
knowledgeable about them and balancing rules and regulations or what your home care company’s own policy 
is? How do you balance those two things? 
P: 
Oh, that is so hard [laughing]. I can’t tell you how hard this one is. It’s sort of an interesting dynamic 
because there’s a lot to say about that, actually. The home care companies and their polices—and I don’t know 
if it’s a lot of the policies of the home care place or the way that the state looks at different things, but 
sometimes something like where you wanna go in and do something for somebody and technically you’re not 
allowed to. Like mowing the law because there’s a liability issue to using that lawn mower, we’re not really 
allowed to mow the lawn. We’re not allowed to do more than shoveling snow more than a driveway or more 
than a walkway, not a driveway. You shouldn’t shovel driveways, and again, it’s a liability issue. And some of it 
our policies from the place, and some of it are state issues, and I don’t always know which is which, but it’s 
hard as an aide when you want to just reach out to somebody and help them, and you’re not even sure if  
you’re allowed to do what you’re trying to do [44.53]. So, that gets to be an interesting dynamic. For me it’s 
kind of like I’ve gotten talked to [laughs]. I got talked to one time about plantin’ flowers. “Well, the state says 
you’re not there to beautify their house.” Oh, okay, then [laughs]. Planting flowers in my mind I’m thinking of 
this as, well, you know, this particular client is in a wheelchair, and he sits by the window, and when I planted 
those flowers I planted them in a planter where he could see them. In my mind, that’s life enrichment. How 
does that translate into beautifying his house?

I: 
How would it have been different if he—if that’s what he wanted? If he had said what I really want you 
to do today, is plant flowers. 
P: 
He did. He did actually say that to me. Yes. He said, “If you have a minute, and you’re able to do so, 
and you’re interested in doing so--,” all those things. He does say all those things, you know. Because he 
knows too, and it’s like—and then you put it on your paper because they tell you, “Write everything down that 
you do,” and then you put it on your paper, and then they come back at you and they say, “Well, you know, 
you’re not there to do this,” it’s so specific to the things that we’re there to do. Sometimes it’s like trying to color 
in the lines and you’re 5-years-old, and you don’t know how to color in the lines [laughs]. That’s the best way I 
can think of to say it. 
I: 
The examples you’re using I think must be at the agency level versus being at the federal or the state 
level. They don’t get down to, you know, you can’t plant flower, you can’t do this, you can’t do that. So, there 
must be so many fuzzy areas. 
P: 
There’s a lot of gray areas, and a lot of it comes—and a lot of it too is are the aides that come through 
or they, you know, hurt themselves by doing something or—and then it kinda ruins it for everybody else. You 
know what I mean [42.46]? So, it’s hard as an agency—that’s gotta be hard too to make those calls, you know, 
so I try to adhere to what they tell me. You know, and follow things because I know they have reasons, and 
they’re a good company, you know. I love the home care company I work for [laughs]. I probably should say 
their name right, but [laughing] you know who you are. No [laughing]. 
I: 
So, a lot of, as you pointed out, a lot of the restrictions are designed to keep the clients safe, but also to 
keep you safe, right? 
P: 
Yes. Yes. 
I: 
And do you worry about—have you ever been injured? Do you worry about injury? 
P: 
I have been injured in the past. When I worked in nursing home I had a client with dementia, and I sat 
her on the toilet, and I went to get her up and she kinda freaked out on me, and when I went to stand her up 
and she started yellin’ at me and fightin’ me, and when I went to try to turn her with the gait belt she didn’t 
wanna turn with me, and I turned in a funny way, and I hurt my back, and I pinched a nerve in my back. I was 
on light duty for like 3 weeks. It was miserable [laughing], but eventually I was able to overcome that injury, but 
I see things like that a lot—twisting, bending, especially in this job. It takes it’s toll on your body a lot, and I 
think people underestimate the physical aspect of being a PCA ‘cause there’s a lotta work to it. You have to 
answer a light, and then go answer another light, and then either that or if you’re workin’ even in residential 
setting, you’ve got four or five clients. Maybe they all have to use the bathroom at the same time. How do you 
get around that? [Laughing] I mean there’s just no way you can stick four people on it. There’s not four of me. 
There’s one of me and four of them, so how do you choose who goes first, you know? That’s an interesting 
thing. Sometimes you don’t know who goes first. First person to push the call light is first person to [laughing] 
get on the toilet. You know. Then you’ve got to run to the next one, and yeah. I got out of long-term care 
essentially because it felt too impersonal to me. It’s like spending 15 minutes in a room with a person, and then 
having to run out of the room to go take care of the next person [40.06]. 
I: 
What I’ve heard from a lot of people over the years is that that they move out of nursing homes into 
home care because they just can’t handle the physical side of it anymore. So, home care is physical but not as 
physical as having, you know, 12 people. 
P: 
Right. Well, sometimes as, you know, when you work in a nursing home, I’ve had up to, you know, 15-
20 people on my own, which is against the regulations, but you know, despite what the regulations say, staffing 
isn’t always there.

I: 
And even in the home, so you know, people—it’s a little less physically taxing, but I’m always struck 
by—it still can be very physical, right? 
P: 
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I have a guy that I go to in the mornings. I have to get him up out of the bed. Get 
him into his wheelchair, you know, make sure he’s changed—range of motion—all that’s physical. You know, 
having to roll him around, and things like that, and then to get him up in the chair, get him his breakfast. You’re 
feeding him, and then making sure he has everything he needs before you leave, and I go back at night and do 
the same thing gettin’ him back into bed and gettin’ him his dinner. 
I: 
The one thing that strikes me about that in-home care is that if you do get injured you can’t do your job. 
P: 
Right. 
I: 
And then there’s no income. 
P: 
Right. Yes. Mmm hmm. You’re just kinda stuck. 
I: 
Kinda stuck. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
We started out—you said you have lots of stories. What kind of stories? Can you think of a client that 
you want to tell us about or a situation you had? 
P: 
Let’s see. I had—well, besides the one that jumped out the window [laughing], mmm— 
I2: 
Let me add to that. You may be sitting—you may just have met someone. They’re like asking you about 
what you do and you’re like, “Let me tell you about what it was like once.” That’s kind of what we’re looking for 
because it kind of helps people relate to a small [inaudible] experience. 
P: 
Okay. Mmm, let’s see. Well, I have a home care client right now that I go in and I take care of—he’s 
through the VA [37.39], and he is well into his 90s. And he doesn’t walk a lot, and things like that, and he’s in 
his chair often, but when I first came to him they were very unaware of what any of the healthcare—any of the 
home care situation was. They had no idea. He’s askin’ me, “Well, do you work for the VA?” And, you know, 
the questions like that. And I’m like trying to explain to him, no, I don’t work, you know, don’t work for the VA, 
but I work—my company is hired by the VA. So, in around about way, yes, I work for the VA. And trying to sit 
there and explain to him, you know, I’m here to take of you, and he looks at me, and he says, “What do you 
mean take care of me? I don’t need you to take care of me [laughs].” It’s like okay. Let me put this a different 
way [laughing]. You know, and it’s trying to figure out, well, are there things I could do around the house or 
somethin’ like that? You know, if there’s anything you need me to do around the house, I can do those things, 
you know simple things like, you know, if you need your hair washed, if you need a shower, anything like that I 
can help you. He’s just kinda lookin’ at me, like, okay [laughs]. You know, now, we’re almost 6 months into that 
relationship, and I do soak his feet every time I’m there, and I wash his hair once a week, and I do a lot around 
the house, and the dynamic has changed, and he sees me—he sees more of what I do now, and he’s more 
comfortable with me in there. But at first, he was very hesitant to have me there, you know. 
I: 
All of these people that you help provide supports and services to, what would they do without you in 
their home? 
P: 
Now, granted some of them may make it okay, and they’d be alright, but you know, there are a lot of 
people that, [sigh] if you just—you don’t really necessarily see it when you see the person because the person 
is walking around, and they’re lookin’ like they’re okay, and they’re lookin’ perfectly healthy. And you think, oh, 
this person is still in their right mind. They’re still able to do all the things that a normal person can do, and then 
you start noticing ‘em walk around the house, and they’re getting winded as soon as they get, you know, take 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Jennifer Lugo. Grand Rapids. 6.9.18

10 steps, and they’re, you know, gotta go sit down for a minute because as soon as they get up, you know, 
they’re tired, and you realize that if you weren’t there, you know, their house probably wouldn’t get cleaned. 
You know, just the simple things like getting the dishes done, getting the counters cleaned, getting the stove 
wiped down, so that they don’t get mice in their house, you know. Simple things like that [34.56] can go a long 
way, and even when you’re not necessarily providing that personal body care to them, if they didn’t have a 
clean environment to stay in, then some of these people wouldn’t be able to stay at home. So, it’s very 
important that we’re there because we do provide that service as well, and it’s sometimes more important to 
have a clean house, and when they can take care of themselves, essentially, still do their own personal cares, 
but that other element of the house cleaning’s just as important. But vice versa as well, you know, if they can’t 
clean up their house, and they can’t even take care of themselves, how are they gonna be able to do anything 
else? So, you being there can sometimes be the difference between a person staying at home and going into a 
long-term care facility. 
I: 
And how do you feel about—I mean I often hear the work that you do referred to as either unskilled 
labor or low-skilled— 
P: 
[Laughing] hello to those people. You are wrong! [Laughing] that is such an understatement to me. Like 
I said, it goes back to not knowing what you’re gonna deal with when you walk into somebody’s house. You 
never know first of all the mental state of the person you’re walkin’ into their house, how they’re gonna look at 
you, and how they’re gonna treat you. You don’t know if they necessarily want you there. You don’t know—you 
don’t always fully—you don’t even always fully know their needs because sometimes some times when that 
person comes to assess the individual, their honesty level is not always there. If that makes sense? Like, “Oh, I 
can do more—I can do all these things for myself,” but when you get into the house [32.59] you start to realize, 
maybe not so much, you know. And then you got to start adding things to your list because where they told so 
and so or the daughter told the nurse, “Well, she can do this still.” Maybe the daughter doesn’t realize that she 
can’t do that anymore, you know. And those things can change so rapidly—those little changes can come so 
rapidly in a person, and you don’t always see it. Like my mom, when she was declining, I really didn’t 
understand how much she was declining when she stayed with me until I took her to the doctor one day, and 
he started asking her all these random questions about, “Do you know the month? Do you know the day? Do 
you know—”, and she couldn’t answer any of ‘em, and the only thing she answered was that Obama was 
president, and I was quite surprised at that. But knowing that I saw her every day, took care of her every day, I 
had no idea that she had fell off of the track in her mind so much. It hit me so hard. It was such a reality check 
to say, but my mother stayed with me in the same house, how did I not see that? It drove me crazy, you know, 
so to family members that are out there struggling with this same thing it’s like, I understand how you cannot 
know. You know, people are good at hiding things. People can be so good at hiding things, and I’ve seen 
people with dementia that are really good at hiding it. This little lady I take care of and I go into her house, the 
only way you know that she’s got dementia is because she’ll tell you the story about her trees all the time 
[laughing]. She planted the trees in her backyard, and she loves ‘em, and you’ll hear about the whole time 
you’re there. And that’s fine. That’s the other thing is you’ve gotta have a lot of patience for this job, and people 
underestimate [whispering] that too. When the person’s telling you the same thing over and over and over 
again, and you’re like, yeah, I already know. I already know. You don’t have to say you already know. You just 
say, oh, really? Wow. That’s neat. Oh, really, wow! That’s neat. No matter how many times you’ve gotta say it, 
what’s the harm in it you know? [Laughing]. 
I: 
That’s a great moment to pause [laughing]. I want to make sure we capture the stories that you were 
sort of thinking about before you got here. 
P: 
Yeah. It’s hard ‘cause my mind’s like all over the place [laughing] right now. 
I: 
Are we catching anything? 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Jennifer Lugo. Grand Rapids. 6.9.18 
 
12
P: 
Yeah. Yup. A few. 
I2: 
I love what you just said about the patience thing because that is a huge component. 
P: 
It is. And it’s such— 
I2: 
And it’s not so obvious to a lot of people. 
P: 
Yeah. Well, it’s one of those things where if you just had more understanding of the type of disease 
you’re dealing with [29.57] and you research it a little bit because I’ve done an extensive research on 
Alzheimer’s. I’ve done extensive research on frontal temporal dementia, even though there’s not very much 
research out there. That’s another thing. They need more research—a lot more research on that disease 
because it’s just the way that they describe it, it’s not—they describe it in medical terminology, but the 
presentation’s not very described, and in my mind,  it is so drastically different from the other types of 
dementia. My grandfather had Alzheimer’s for 5 years. I mean he didn’t die of Alzheimer’s, but he died 
because of malnutrition because he wasn’t eating because he didn’t remember to eat. And that’s essentially 
what happens, it’s the bi-product of those diseases, you know, but my mom is 10 years plus, and they’re 
looking at her and they’re going, “We don’t even know what to do at this stage because we’ve never seen 
somebody live past 10 years with this disease.” So, you know, and of course, a lot of that attribution—and I 
don’t know that this is the case, but a lot of the attribution goes to her staying at home. 
I: 
I was going to say, she got good care. 
P: 
In my mind, I can wrap my mind around that because somebody staying at home I feel like that gives 
them longevity. You know, when you go into a nursing home— 
I2: 
Let’s talk about this on camera. 
I: 
Okay. You ready? 
I2: 
Yeah. Well, let me get ready. I’m almost there. 
I: 
Well, we’ll back up for a second. Okay? 
I2: 
Okay. Yes. 
I: 
Okay. We wanna capture this story, you were saying that your mom is kind of defying the odds, 
according to the doctors, that she’s living well past what they expected in terms of years. 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
So, she’s— 
P: 
Well— 
I: 
Tell us that story. 
P: 
Yes. Frontal temporal dementia, they say has a—well, from what I’ve read and understand of it, life 
expectancy is around 10 years from diagnoses. Well, my mom was diagnosed in 2011, but she had it well 
before that. I mean she had it at least 2007, and here we’re on year 2018, so you’re talking she’s had it for 11 
years. And last year the doctors were just in awe at how well she has done, and even though, like for instance, 
she’s even still verbal. She can even still say I love you, and things like that. And they never expected her to be 
able to talk 11 years into the disease let alone be alive 11 years into the disease. And they do attribute a lot of 
that to her being—her initial care being at home, and how long she was able to stay at home, and because 
they say that, you know, and even in my eyes, when a person can stay at home [26.53] that will increase your 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Jennifer Lugo. Grand Rapids. 6.9.18 
 
13
longevity in your life. It will, you know, the more comfortable you are in your own skin, you know, and the more 
you can be yourself, you can’t always be yourself in these other places. You know you have to adhere to all 
these different rules and regulations, and you have certain times you gotta eat, and you got certain times you 
gotta sleep, and you know, it puts a lotta pressure on people I think. And even my mom, I saw that change. It 
was a very drastic change for her. You know, she’s lost probably mmm 40 pounds since 3 years ago. I mean 
she’s lost a lotta weight, you know, when she was at home with me, she wasn’t losing any weight. Just the 
differences—now I know the progression of her disease plays it’s part in that, but I also know that just the 
structure for her, she doesn’t care for it all. You know, it took her a long time to get used to that structure, and 
people don’t understand when we go from a home—from your home into a nursing home, the things you have 
to give up and the life you leave behind, I mean you leave your entire, you know, however many years’ worth 
of belongings. Sometimes they have to just get sold. Sometimes you have to sell your house, and just to make 
it into a place to live, and then your whole livelihood—everything you thought was gonna happen for you, just 
kinda goes away, and it’s no wonder that when people get into nursing homes that the depression, and these 
mental problems people have—it’s really no wonder [24.56], you know, and we underestimate that too as 
home care or as healthcare workers. On the flip side of that in-home care, it’s my privilege to be able to go into 
somebody’s home and make sure it’s clean, and make sure they’re taken care of, so I don’t see them wind up 
in a place like that. Interestingly enough I have had clients in home care that I took care of in nursing homes. 
I: 
Tell us one of those stories. 
P: 
That is very interesting. Actually, one right off the top of my head is a very recent case, and I’m actually 
still very involved in this family. Took take of this client at a nursing facility, basically across the street from 
where he lived. He had some health issues. Don’t remember if it was a stroke or I think he might have fell and 
broke a hip or something. And he came to the rehab unit where I was working third shift, and so helping him 
rehab back home, you know, it just—one of those things, you know, you go through with the motions, and ya 
do what you’re supposed to do or whatever. And then, okay, so 3, 4 years, 5  years later I’m in home care, and 
my company sends me to this address, and I’m lookin’ at the name, and I’m like, man, this name looks really 
familiar to me. And I just couldn’t get it outta my head, and I got there, and we started talkin’, and he makes 
mention of being in that facility. And I said, how long ago were you there? And he tells me, and I’m like, you’ve 
gotta be kidding me. I’m like that’s why you look so—that’s why it’s so familiar to me. I’m like I remember taking 
care of you, and it was just so neat. And it was funny because when I was talking to him I was on the side of 
him and he hadn’t even looked up at me yet, and when he turned and looked at me he recognized me [22.54], 
and it was the craziest thing. And it was really neat, and his daughter—his wife was on Hospice—his daughter 
had just moved back to their house to take care of them. And so, he was my home care client for a while, and 
then I actually stopped working for ACE for a little while, and just took some time off. I was painting with my 
husband for a minute, and then I had some family come in, so I took some time off. But when I went back to 
the company, I didn’t get him back as a client, but his daughter wound up calling me, seeing me in Meijer one 
day, and she asked me if I could come and help out because they had dropped my home care company 
because they couldn’t have Hospice and the home care company come in. But they needed both, and so, 
when my home care company dropped because they needed Hospice more than they needed home care 
because he had just come out of the hospital with a diagnosis of like stage 4 colon cancer. So, once she saw 
me she’s like, “Well, if you’re not doin’ anything, I could really use your help.” I was like, oh, I don’t know. I’m 
gonna have to check and see what I can do, and I wound up comin’ in there, and so once I heard her story and 
learned what she was goin’ through with the company, I’m like, that’s terrible you can’t have two different, you 
know, you need both of those services right now. It became a money issue. So, I don’t know if it became a 
money issue with the state or with the Medicaid/Medicare. I don’t know if he was on that, but—or with the 
insurance. But whatever the case may be, I went in there on a private note and I was doin’ stuff for him and 
taking care of him in the mornings. And then they had another aide that was taking care of him before that was 
involved as well on her own time. So.

I: 
Let’s talk about the money for just a moment. This last section I want to get into the role of personal 
care worker within a bigger context. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
One of the reasons that we are, you know, we hear over and over that one reason for the shortage of 
workers is because of the poor labor conditions like low pay. 
P: 
Oh, yes. 
I: 
Can you talk about pay just for a moment? 
P: 
Yeah. Well, on home care I can say it’s definitely a big jump down for me from working in a nursing 
home. It is—where I made $12 an hour in a nursing home, I started out workin’ for my home care company I 
think at $9 something an hour. Close to minimum wage, maybe minimum wage, and they did just bump us up 
to $10 an hour, and we were all kinda jumpin’ up and down about that one [laughs], but you know, as far as the 
pay goes, it’s—to me it doesn’t make much sense because you’re doing the same work [19.40] that you would 
do in a nursing home for a lot of the people that you take care of. And even if it’s not the same, you know, goin’ 
in and cleaning somebody’s entire house or kitchen, bathroom, whatever, you know, yeah, that’s work [laughs]. 
That’s work [laughs]. Anybody who says it’s not, they don’t like cleanin’ their own house, and so if you don’t like 
cleanin’ your house, how can you say it’s not work, right? [Laughs] but you know, it’s—there is a physical 
element to it even though it’s died down, per se, from the nursing homes, but you’re still essentially responsible 
for that persons’ wellbeing. So, to, you know, and personally I know what these home care companies get paid 
[laughing]. Some of ‘em it’s a little bit up there, and I know I don’t get paid $20 to $25 an hour. Now, I 
understand they’ve got overhead and all that kinda stuff too, but you know, the aide is the one that’s doin’ the 
work, you know, they’re doin’ all the work for that person. So, it’s an interesting dynamic to me. 
I: 
And can people make a living doing that with $10 an hour? 
P: 
Not particularly. No. If it wasn’t for my husband owning his own business, I would not be doin’ this. I 
would be probably working in a nursing home because we need the money. We need the money, and it’s kept 
me out of the nursing homes being able to have that financial freedom, but it’s sad because a lotta times where 
if I ever considered going back to a nursing home in my mind, it’s because of the money. 
I: 
What about benefits? 
P: 
Um hmm. What benefits [laughing]? There’s not a lotta benefits. My company’s good in the way that 
they give us a lot of praise, and they give us a lot of little things throughout the year, but as far as actual 
benefits go like 401K, insurance—insurance I think is really hard to come by in that field. I don’t think they offer 
much in the way of insurance. At least not a lotta home care companies, but home care is relatively—I don’t 
wanna say relatively new, but it is relatively new in the big scheme of things. It’s more the up and coming thing 
I fee like rather than, you know, assisted living [16.54]. I can think back about 10 years ago when assisted 
living was all the rave, and everybody was talkin’ about assisted living, and now we’re sort of phasing out of 
that again, and into the home care world. And you see home care companies poppin’ up all over the place, 
which is a definite indicator of the need. That’s my thing. If there wasn’t a need, they wouldn’t be there. So, on 
that respect I mean I think that these companies should be paying the same type of wages that you’d find in 
the nursing world. You know, because even though you’re taking care of one person at a time, you may not be 
taking care of 12 at a time. That’s a person you’re keeping from going into a place like that, you know. And if it 
wasn’t for you bein’ there, they probably would wind up there. 
I: 
So, another reason that we hear often for the turnover—the high turnover rate among home care 
works, is a lack of respect. That’s not just about the money, it’s about the way in which they’re being treated. 
How do you—

P: 
Well, I’ve had my qualms. I’ve had to tell my scheduler, like, ooh, ooh, ooh, whoa. Way too much. Way 
too much. Sometimes you get to the point where there’s not a real good communication, and so they’ll add 
people to your schedule, or they’ll have you driving out—way out here, and you don’t really wanna go out way 
out here. You have to be a little bit [15.21]—you have to kind of take a stand for what you want when you work 
in home care because you are able to make—at least at most home care companies that I’m aware of you can 
make your own schedule. So, and your availability, but you have to be pretty specific, but they will—there are 
things that they will have you do that some people don’t wanna do. Some people will just, you know, won’t 
clean toilets. You know, it kinda goes both ways I guess is what I’m sayin’. I haven’t really had the problem with 
respect. My home care company is amazing. They do really well by me. I’ve never felt mistreated by them, so I 
guess I don’t really know when you say lack of respect. 
I: 
Well, I guess I’m thinking more— 
P: 
Or is it from the clients? 
I: 
No. I’m thinking more from society in general. 
P: 
Ah, okay. 
I: 
So, how do you feel that—how do you think the society in general views the work that you do? 
P: 
Umm I’d say it is definitely not [sigh]—they have a very narrow view of home care. A lot of it is chalked 
up to house cleaning. The part that you’re missing is that—the part that people are missing in that it is just what 
I said before. It’s like you’re not just keeping somebody’s house clean, you’re keeping somebody at home. 
There’s a difference, you know, and when you look at it from the perspective of, “Oh, you’re just cleaning a 
house,” yeah, it seems menial, you know. It doesn’t seem all that important. Well, you don’t have to always 
have your house clean, you know, but what if that person’s incontinent? Then, yeah, it’s a good idea to clean 
their toilet, you know, a couple times a week [laugh]. You know, I have a couple of clients like that. If I didn’t go 
in there and clean on a weekly basis, boy, it would look pretty bad [laughs]. So, it’s all, you know, people don’t 
understand the dynamics that you have to deal with on a daily basis. They don’t understand what you may 
walk into, and they don’t understand the emotional ties that come with it too [12.58]. You know, you grow to 
learn about people, and to connect with them once you’re there, you know. And you build a relationship with 
somebody and they’re family, so it’s a really important job. It shouldn’t be underestimated because that’s the 
way we’re going. That’s the way this world is going is into home care. We don’t have enough nursing facilities 
to support the population growing consistently every day. With this baby-boomer generation, it’s crazy to me to 
see how many people really need care, and don’t ask for it, and it’s not just about—and it’s not just about the 
baby-boomer generation, it’s about the increase and rise in dementia. That is huge. There is a huge gap in 
acuity of care, and staffing ratios. Our staffing is—and this comes down to the state level. This really does. The 
state is not requiring these facilities to have the right number of staff per resident ratio. You know, you’re 
talking, oh, well, you know, 10 people—that’s not so bad. Yeah, well, you try taking care of 10 people with 
dementia, and then walk into our world one day, sit down, and deal with it, and then walk out and tell me 
something—tell me the same story. It’s one of those type of situations. 
I: 
So, given that situation, and the pay rate, and lack of benefits and everything, how are we ever going to 
recruit new people to the field and convince them that it’s a career they should aspire to? 
P: 
I think— 
I: 
What would you say to young people that you wanted to convince that this might be worth considering 
as a career? 
P: 
Well, you know, I would flip it around from the family perspective. You know, if this was your 
grandmother or grandfather or mom or dad or whatever, you know, where would you wanna see them spend 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018

the end of life? You know would you wanna see them spend the end of their life in a nursing home or would 
you rather see them at home [10.34]? You know, it’s—because if you just—if you open that door to perspective 
to somebody that doesn’t have it, you know, it’s just easy to think about it as being just a job. But you’re 
helping somebody keep their independence. You’re helping somebody keep their way of life and not lose 
everything they have. You know, and you’re an essential part of that, so it’s a big thing in their life. You’re a big 
part of many people’s lives and whatever house you walk into, however many houses you walk into, that’s how 
many people you’re keepin’ their longevity goin’, and you’re keepin’ their life goin’, essentially, and their 
comfort. 
I: 
And if you had a chance to talk to the policymakers, like the Governor or the President— 
P: 
[Inaudible – whispering] [group laughter]. 
I: 
Well, you can—give it your best shot. What would you tell them? 
P: 
I would tell them definitely look at long-term care in terms of their staffing. Home care staffing needs to 
be more put in the spotlight—the importance of it, you know, the awareness of the need needs to be raised, 
and you know, people need to know that there are—there’s just such a need out there. And you’re not going to 
get workers unless the pay is there because the work sometimes outweighs the pay by far, and that’s true. And 
so, it’s—you know, and that’s just on somedays. Somedays it’s light, and somedays it’s not, but when you’re 
considering all those people that are living in nursing homes and how many people you could just keep in their 
own homes, you know, you would eliminate a huge—you’d probably eliminate a huge cost to running those 
facilities if we just looked more towards home care too. You know, facility costs I can’t imagine what it costs to 
keep up some of these places, but if you have somebody individually going house to house, you know, it’s a 
little bit different I think. 
I: 
So, one of your recommendations would be to raise the pay rate? 
P: 
Yes. Pay rate, benefits, for sure in the home care field, yeah. 
I: 
Put the spotlight on home care versus nursing home care. 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
Other recommendations?  
P: 
Well, like I was sayin’ about the long-term care the staffing there. That’s such a big issue. And as far as 
home care goes [7.23], I guess just to maybe change even sometimes the—there’s a difference, too, in the 
way that the VA clients are—like VA clients, when you get hired for a VA client, I have to be a certified nursing 
aide, but I can go to the other side of my company ‘cause I work for basically two different sides of my 
company. Seeing’s that I’m a certified nursing assistant, I can do this side with just more involved care, but 
then on the flip side of that is the cleaning, more or less the light-duty stuff. Well, you don’t have to be certified 
to do that, but you’re still going into somebody’s home who has these problems, so you should still be certified. 
So, I think the standard of training needs to change, and they need to make that—pronounce that more like, 
you need to have more training before you go into somebody’s home. You need to be a certified nursing 
assistant at the minimum. It doesn’t take a lot to become a nurse assistant. I think it was like a 6-week program 
for me, so there’s ways of getting it paid for, too. So, the training is out there. 
I: 
So, require training. 
P: 
Yes! Yes. 
I: 
Minimum number of hours of training.

P: 
Yes.  
I: 
For home care aides? 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
Yes. Okay. And maybe make that mandatory for the agencies that are hiring them? 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
Okay. Other ideas? 
P: 
Um as far as home care, not so much I don’t think. 
I: 
So, we just have a couple minutes left, and are there stories that you wanted to tell that we did not draw 
out and you’d like to tell us or scenarios that I didn’t throw out there for you to respond to? 
P: 
Yes. I can think of one. I had a lady—and this was actually another dynamic of assisted living, but it 
kinda ties into the home care thing. I had a lady that I took care of in an assisted living home, and the home 
closed down, and while I was there, which was really interesting [4.56] because closing down these facilities 
people don’t understand what they’re doin’ to all these other people. You know, just how it affects them, but it 
really devastated her. She really liked this place. She was really comfortable there, and then she had to move, 
and she was already having—she was already having a hard time adjusting to that place, and then she had to 
move again. And I actually wound up going, sort of in a roundabout way, I went with her [laughs]. I wound up 
going to the next place where she was, and she really wanted home care. She wished so much that she would 
tell me all the time, “If I could just be at home with my husband, I would feel so much better. I wish there was a 
way I could stay home.” And I had mentioned, I was like, well, what about, you know, there’s home care. You 
know, I’ve heard of home care. There’s somethin’ like that, you know, maybe that’s an avenue. And she says, 
“Our insurance won’t pay for home care.” And I don’t know what type of insurance she had, but it was a 
prominent thing that she would say a lot, and it really depressed her that her insurance company would not pay 
for the home care. So, I guess that’s another block too that we need to get rid of is having the insurance 
companies—makin’ sure that they can accommodate for that if that’s what people want. 
I: 
Yeah. There’s hope that that’s actually gonna happen. There have been some changes to Medicare 
Part C, and we hear that by 2019 they might—that Part C might pay for home care, which would be a huge 
shift. 
P: 
Yes. It would. Yes. 
I: 
Any final thoughts? Anything you want to tell the world? 
P: 
We need more compassionate people out there caring for the elderly, caring for the people with these 
problems, this dementia. It’s becoming such a big issue, you know, you don’t know when you’re loved one’s 
gonna get hit with that disease—one of those diseases, and you know, it’s starting at a younger age. That’s the 
other thing that’s scary is dementia is actually—they’ve diagnosed it in children, which is really scary. I mean 
the need is growing. You know, people that have a hard time lookin’ for jobs, you will never have a hard time 
looking for a job if you are a nursing assistant or something of that nature because the need is always there, 
and it’s always constant, and it’s growing. So, I’ve never had a problem finding a job, ever, you know. So, it’s—
even after getting fired from a facility I didn’t have a problem, so it’s not—it’s not something that—healthcare 
isn’t something that should be taken lightly, and people do need to start getting more involved in even caring 
more for their family members. I think too, is another thing. You know, we’ve gotten away from taking care of 
our family members, and we’re busy. We’re so busy, you know, and it’s hard to put that time aside to go check

on mom and dad, but it might just be the best thing to do to keep ‘em at home. You know, and then you start 
seeing things, and then you can take care of it from there [1.09]. So, yeah. 
I: 
Good words to end on. I want to thank you so much for this interview, and for the work that you do that 
is so important to be able to allow people—to help people stay at home. It’s highly valued by us. 
I2: 
Thank you very much. 
P: 
It’s a comfort for me because I don’t wanna see ‘em wind up where I was [laughing]. 
I: 
You’re doing really, really important work, so I hope that these stories will help let the rest of the world 
know how important your work is. 
P: 
Yeah. Yeah, for sure. I hope it makes a difference ‘cause honestly I’ve wanted to for a long time come 
out with all this stuff [laughing]. 
I: 
You’ve gotta write that book. 
P: 
Oh, it’s already—I’m 50 pages in right now. So, it’s in the works [laughing]. 
I: 
Now, I’m gonna clear outta here, so that K can take your photos. 
P: 
Oh, okay. Should I take this off? 
I2: 
Yes. Please. Thank you. 
P: 
Or can I keep it? [Laughs] no.
