Dear Mrs. Allen:
 
The Board of Trustees of the Folklife Center has
 
been in existence for more than thirty n
io Ahs.
 In this
 
trial period,  I have refrained from writing to you or any
 
of your colleagues either with praise or criticism.
 
However,  I must now break silence and speak out as
 
strongly as  I can against the recent Board vote on the
 
folklife survey in conjunction with the Tennessee-
Tombigbee 1
1aterway Project under construction by the
 
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
 
Actually,  I first voiced my criticism of both the
 
project and the survey to Alan Jabbour early in 1978 --
in fact,  on the very day when he broached to me his
 
interest in this matter.
 Further,  I spoke directly to
 
you about my concerns prior to the Vermont meeting of
 
the Board.
 Finally, while Neil Rosenberg was negotiating
 
with Alan Jabbour to become sur
_ve_v director,  I indicated
 
to Neil  the quicksand bog- along  the
 I can
 
only assume that neither ;

e1tly,
 
the  Center was absolved of
 issu e
s in the
 
Corps project.
 I
n effect,  this defines folklorists as
 
impersonal body counters after a battle.
 I totally
 
reject such sophistry.
 From my perspective,  our natural
 
allies are conservationists and preservationists.
 Our
 
future lies  in coalitions with them.
 Presently,  the
 
Environmental Defense Fund is attempting to block the
 
Tenn-Tom project  in Federal court.
 I
deally,  individual
 
folklorists should join the American Rivers  Conservation
 
Council,  Sierra Club,  Rachel Carson Trust,  and other sane
 
citizens groups,  as friends of the court in opposition
 
to the Corps of Engineers.
 
For a decade, while lobbying for the Folklife Bill,
 
I attempted to articulate the necessity for folklorists to
 
link arms with true allies.
 I
t seeps perverse that the
 
Center's largest single survey is linked to and benefits
 
a Corps of Engineers project.
 I
n the event that members
 
of the Board of Trustees wish to absolve  themselves of
 
choice  in this matter,  let me remind you of a problem
 
in tactics.

Even iE the Tenn-Tom Waterway were not a literal
 
cut to disaster  (moving more earth than in the building
 
of the Panama Canal),  I would urge  the Folklife Center
 
to stay a
rray from Corps of Engineers bulldozers.
 
Metaphorically,  there are tons of earth to be moved by
 
the Center staff within the Library of Congress,  and
 
within walking distance of Capitol Hill.
 Let us be as
 
intelligent as we can in choosing between the terrain
 
through which the Corps of Engineers digs, , and the
 
social landscape through which folklorists thread their
 
path.
 
May  I urge you before the next meeting of the
 
Board to read something of the disastrous history of
 
the Corps'  water development projects.
 May  I urge you,
 
further,  to think through the awesome ethical consequences
 
of action by folklorists who work in conjunction with
 
the Corps while it destroys natural eco-systems and
 
disrupts human communities.
 Do we really want a Center
 
which signals to the country at large that folklorists
 
are  insensitive to land ethics and community stability?
 
For myself,  the choice  is clear.
 I shall withdraw
 
my support from the Center -- political,  economic, moral.
 
I
nstead of helping friends of the  Center in fund raising
 
and  in presentations  to Congress,  I shall devote my

Dear Mr. Ripley:
 
THE
. L
IBRARY OF CONGRESS
 
WASHINGTON, U
.C. 20540
 
January 31, 1979
 
Raye Virginia Allen has shared with me your letter
 
to her of January 25.
 She will be replying t
o you as Chairman
 
of the Board of Trustees of the American Folklife Center; but
 
she has suggested, and I agree, that it would be appropriate for
 
me t
o share directly with you my thoughts about the conception,
 
the plan, and the need for the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway
 
Folklife Project.
 
As I sat down to compose this letter, I reviewed the
 
various documents which had been prepared last summer for the
 
Board of Trustees.
 In particular, my lengthy memorandum of
 
July 10, 1978, to the Projects Committee of the Board (
including
 
you) still represents my sense of the need for this project.
 I
 
am enclosing another copy of that memorandum, in case the original
 
copy is not at hand for you, and I am also enclosing a copy of the
 
project statement sent t
o the Board and to the Department of the
 
Interior in July.
 
It strikes me, as I now reflect on these documents, that
 
your concerns about the project on policy grounds echo my own.
 
The Archeological and Historic Preservation Act (
P. L
. 93-291),
 
often referred t
o as t
he Moss-Bennett Act, states clearly the
 
obligation of the federal government to mitigate the adverse impact
 
of dam and waterway projects on the scientific and cultural
 
resources of the impacted area.  The vision to which I clung, as I
 
developed this project, was of a model project which for the first
 
time would use the authority of that preservation act to help preserve
 
the living cultural traditions endangered by the coming waterway.  Such
 
a project both would serve to define "cultural resources" in a
 
broader and more living sense, and at the same time would link, as
 
they properly should be linked, those forces devoted to cultural
 
preservation and those devoted to natural preservation.
 I regard
 
those linkages as a great national challenge for all of us in the
 
I
 
i
 
I
 
i
 
I
 
- 2 -
 
coming decade.  Thus, when you urge the Center t
o show sensitivity to
 
natural as well as cultural conservation issues, I find myself in
 
profound agreement with you.
 
In short, I wonder whether our differences on these
 
i
ssues are more apparent than real.
 Somehow I cannot help feeling
 
that this i
s an issue where our agencies share common interests
 
and the common cause of natural and cultural preservation.
 I
 
should be pleased to discuss further my perception of these issues
 
with you if you wish.

AMERICAN FOLKLIFE CENTER
 January 3

Dear Mr. Ripley:
 
Thank you for your letter of January 25th.
 I am
 
grateful for your expression of confidence in my tenure as
 
Chairman and your comments of general approval regarding the
 
approach of the Board of Trustees to field projects.
 
I assure you I am e
qually grateful for your expression
 
of concern regarding the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway Folklife
 
Project.  As Chairman of the Board, I am anxious to secure the
 
full participation of Board members on policy issues.  Let me
 
address your concerns, and perhaps begin exploring means for
 
easing them.
 
I
 
Your first consideration regards the management
 
experience of the Center for the endeavor.  The general
 
s
trategy we have employed in the Center's development from the
 
outset called for a small versatile professional staff capable of
 
managing various model projects engaged in with assistance from
 
outside sources.
 In the project at hand and in others currently under
 
consideration, our plan has been to engage fulltime project directors
 
who combine administrative experience with professional experience
 
in folklife to carry out the project under the broad supervision of
 
the Center's professional staff.
 
The magnitude of the project was prominently discussed
 
at the two Board meetings during which this project was under active
 
consideration, both within the Projects Committee and before the
 
full Board to which it was referred.
 It has always been the Board's
 
intent to build on the cumulative experience of the Center's projects,
 
refining professional and administrative techniques as our programming
 
moves toward new and larger initiatives.
 
Related t
o your managerial concerns is the particular
 
matter of the nature of the contract with the Project Director.
 
The procedure proposed by the Center is specifically authorized
 
in the Center's legislation (
P.L. 94-201, Section 7 (
a), paragraphs
 
7 and 8
),and the contract has been carefully drawn up by the
 
Library's Contracting Officer in close consultation with the Library's
 
General Counsel.
 I am of course confident in the Library's expertise
 
in these areas; the Center has greatly benefited from the administrative
 
assistance of the Library as an institution.

Regarding t
he second consideration, I appreciate and
 
sympathize with your concern t
hat the project incorporate a
 
sensitivity t
o the issues of ecological and natural conservation
 
raised by the building of the waterway.  Again, this is a matter
 
which was deliberated at the May and November Board meetings, both
 
with the Projects Committee and with the full Board.
 I agree that
 
any effort on behalf of cultural conservation in the area must take
 
into consideration and complement natural and ecological concerns.
 
The Director of the Center, who developed the philosophy of the
 
project and presented it to the Board, should perhaps present his
 
point of view directly to you.
 I have spoken with Alan Jabbour,
 
and he will write you on the subject.
 
I have asked the staff of the Center t
o prepare a
 
chronology which highlights the development of this project, and I
 
am enclosing a copy for your consideration.
 It indicates lengthy,
 
careful procedures in the development of the project and orderly
 
presentation of it to t
he Board.  You already have the minutes from
 
the May and November meetings which record the discussion that took
 
place then.
 
Finally, let me repeat my appreciation for your
 
expression of concern.
 I think it would be appropriate to share
 
your concerns with the Board at its next meeting.  The Board
 
will meet on Friday, February 23, 1979, at the Library of Congress,
 
and we shall include a place in the agenda for further discussion
 
of the project.
 It would be especially helpful if you were able
 
t
o attend personally to share your thoughts and reflections with
 
US.
 We shall be pleased to schedule the agenda to suit your
 
convenience.
 
Sincerely yours,
 
Raye Virginia Allen

Dear Archie:
 
February 2
, 1979
 
This l
etter in response t
o your January 30, 1979
 
letter is t
he most difficult letter I have ever written.  The
 
withdrawal of your support from t
he American Folklife Center is
 
both a personal disappointment and a shattering experience for
 
a chairman of the Board of Trustees.  On the personal side, you
 
are responsible for alerting me t
o t
he urgent necessity of
 
preserving our.American F
olklife.
 You are t
he evangelist who
 
influenced my participation in the crusade.  Your t
otal commitment
 
continues t
o be a source of inspiration to me.
 Your life is a witness
 
t
o all the best of human values.
 The integrity in you strikes t
he
 
chord of t
he best in me.  My life is better for having been
 
t
ouched by your life.  You are more t
han a friend; you are a hero
 
to me.
 
Li addition t
o t
hese personal concerns, you are a one-
man "institution" i
n t
he f
olk cultural world.  You are t
he father
 
of the American Folklife Preservation Act t
hat established our
 
Center.
 Everyone who i
s involved i
n t
he American cultural
 
landscape knows t
he contributions and sacrifices made by Archie
 
Green in behalf of cultural expression.
 Thousands of us are in
 
your debt for the investment you have made and continue t
o make.
 
Therefore, as a Board member and as chairman, your d
issatisfaction
 
is extremely grievous t
o me.  As I t
old you in our t
elephone and
 
face-to-face conversations, I find i
t quite difficult to accept
 
your disappointment and recent decision to withdraw support.
 But
 
accept the reality I must.  As an appointee of the Congress t
o t
he
 
Board (
to which I have taken an oath), and as the elected chairman
 
of that Board, I must carry out my responsibility as best I can.
 
As I have mentioned to you, I must e
=ither resign or I carry out my
 
duty as chairman.
 
I
n'the last several days f
ollowing our t
alks and your
 
letter
., I have attempted t
o thread through t
his controversy to
 
determine what steps I must t
ake.
 I have decided on t
he following
 
procedure.
 First, I will, of course, distribute your letter of
 
protest L
o t
he Tennessee-Tombigbee Folklife Project t
o t
he members
 
of the Board and t
heir representatives.
 Second, I plan t
o set aside
 
a block of t
ime for discussion of this i
ssue at t
he next Board
 
meeting on Friday, February 23, 1979,  Third, I invite and urge you
  
t
o present your views at this meeting.  The t
ime can be arranged t
o
 
fit your schedule.

In your letter you raise very large and complicated
 
questions concerning the moral issues involved in the work of folk-

 Archie, do you see the role of the
 
Board of the American Polklife Center as being the "theologians"
 
who write the "commandments" for the folklore profession?  At present--
and I speak only for myself--I do not characterize the role of the
 
Board as establishing a prescribed set of ethical and moral
 
standards which should be determined by the profession itself.
 
In your campaign of "consciousness raising" among folklorists and
 
related professions,  I beseech you to encourage groups to establish
 
a written set of standards that can be a guide for our Board decisions--
and for other similar boards in their decision making.
 The issue
 
of standards comes up frequently.
 In your knowledge, who has or
 
should articulate such a code?  And,  in your opinion, who should be
 
the custodians of such a code?
 
L am convinced that every u
u0mbcr of the
. Board of the
 
American Po.l
.klife Center takes "seriously"--Lo quote your letter--
the two central words in our act:
 "folklife" and "preservation."
 
I certainly do.

AMERICAN FOLKLIFE CENTER
 
Dear Archie:
 
THE L
IBRARY OF CONGRESS
 
WASHINGTON, D
.C. 2
0540
 
February 5
, 1979
 
I feel compelled to respond at length to your letter
 
of January 30 to Raye Virginia Allen, even though it was not
 
addressed to me, for your assertions and your rhetoric are deeply
 
painful to me.
 I cannot enter into debate on the subject in stark
 
black and white terms, but let me give you the carefully reasoned
 
and cautiously weighed stance which led to our decisions in the
 
first place.
 
I shall begin with a brief account of the development
 
of our project along the Tombigbee River.  First, the American
 
Folklife Center did not solicit this project.  Rather, we were
 
approached by archeologist-administrators from the Department of
 
the Interior and the Corps of Engineers who had heard of the work
 
of the Center in South Georgia.
 I believe I can say that they were
 
drawn to the Center for several reasons:  our strength in material
 
culture, our interest in experimental fieldwork, our serious concern
 
about public products of our work, and our concern t
o insure that
 
our work benefits those people whose cultural traditions are the
 
focus of study.  Our negotiations on the subject were extended, and
 
in the process I weighed the many opportunities as well as the dangers
 
that such a project might present.
 I talked with various people in
 
our profession, including you, and the concept of the project was ex-
tensively discussed with the Board of Trustees of the American Folklife
 
Center--both in its Projects Committee and before the full Board--at
 
its May 1978 and November 1978 meetings.  No Board member to my
 
knowledge endorsed the building of the waterway, and none of us re-
gards the project as in any way benefiting its construction.
 
Rather, the vision which made it seem worthwhile as a
 
matter of policy to undertake the project was precisely the vision
 
of common cause with forces of natural and cultural preservation
 
which you have urged upon us.  To understand this, one must look
 
more carefully at the Archeological and Historic Preservation Act--
the so-called Moss-Bennett Act--under which the funds were authorized.
 
The Archeological and Historic Preservation Act (
P. L
. 93-291) is
 
H
 
i
 
i
P
 
,
•

- Z -
 
an important component of the array of federal legislation touching
 
upon preservation.
 I
t declares that the federal government has
 
a responsibility t
o mitigate the adverse impact of water projects on
 
scientific and cultural resources in the area.  The determination
 
of an adverse impact is made by the Secretary of the Interior, and
 
upon that determination up to one percent of the construction budget
 
for a water project may be set aside to mitigate its impact.  Up
 
t
o now, the authority of the Act has been invoked chiefly by
 
archeologists, anthropologists, historians, architectural historians,
 
and historic preservationists.  Our project along the Tombigbee River
 
would for the first time implement that responsibility on behalf of
 
living folk cultural traditions.
 
Thus, in policy terms the "target agency" addressed sym-
bolically through the project is not the Corps of Engineers but the
 
Department of the Interior, and specifically the recently established
 
Heritage Conservation and Recreation Service (
HCRS), described in
 
the United States Government Manual as "the Federal focal point for
 
planning, evaluation, and coordination related to natural, cultural, and
 
recreational resources."  Let me mention here a few key preservation-
ist offices within HCRS: Historic American Building Survey, Historic
 
American Engineering Record, National Register of Historic Places,
 
National Landmarks Program, Interagency Archeological Services,
 
and Historic Sites Survey.
 Its Historic Preservation Fund provides
 
grants-in-aid t
o state historic preservation offices and to the
 
National Trust f
or Historic Preservation.  Our contract for the
 
Tombigbee River project is with Interagency Archeological Services,
 
but we anticipate working closely during the project with offices
 
such as the Historic American Building Survey and the Historic American
 
Engineering Record, both of which have already done extensive research
 
along the Tombigbee River.
 
My first goal in undertaking the project is to broaden the
 
definition of t
he word "culture" and the phrase "cultural resources"
 
within HCRS.  The agency has tended up to now to define "cultural
 
resources" in t
erms of things past and things artifactual.  Folklife
 
as a complementary concept would in my opinion strengthen and enrich
 
their vision of their cultural mission.
 
As a second policy goal, I hope through the project to
 
strengthen the concept of cultural preservation within the
 
Interior Department at large.  The Department of the Interior can
 
be viewed as a pyramidal structure incorporating an eternal debate
 
between preservation and conservation of our nation's resources on
 
the one hand, and development of those resources on the other.  The
 
decision-making pinnacle of the pyramid is of course the Secretary of
 
the Interior.  Thus, it is critical to inject a broad definition of
 
1 p
 
- 3 -
 
culture--present and intangible as well as past and tangible--into
 
the preservation and conservation wing of t
hat Interior Department
 
dialogue.
 I
t will strengthen the hand of t
he preservationists and
 
conservationists and help insure that the Department does not veer
 
into becoming simply a "
department of natural resources," as the
 
current administration has been advocating.
 
The wedding of natural and cultural preservation:
 t
hat is
 
the theme I return to again and again as I ponder our national future.
 
As I said once in a Director's Column of Folklife Center News, I
 
am convinced that our concept of folklore and folklife can be the
 
fulcrum which joins the two.  That is our awesome challenge and moral
 
responsibility in the next decade.
 
Let me now address some of the particular points of your
 
letter.
 First, t
he scope of the folklife project, as you can see
 
by reviewing the f
ormal proposal, clearly goes beyond mere documentary
 
preservation, or as you put it, being "impersonal body counters."
 
We all have envisioned a project which involved not only documentation
 
and analysis, but t
he development of products benefiting the human
 
communities along the Tombigbee River. All my public and private
 
comments.on t
he project have presented this perspective, including
 
statements t
o local and regional organizations and institutions.
 
There i
s certainly no reason why folklorists cannot lend their ex-
pertise both in documentation and analysis and in direct assistance
 
to the cause of preserving the continuity of traditional life in the
 
human communities where we work.  Certainly the state cultural agencies
 
of Mississippi and Alabama, t
he local colleges and universities, and
 
such local organizations as t
he Minority People's Council, which
 
monitors the development of the waterway, have understood this con-
joining of study and assistance to be our thrust.
 
Second, I fail t
o see how the project "benefits" the builders
 
of the waterway, as you say.  The f
iscal control is clearly in t
he
 
hands of the Center, which in turn will invest the project director
 
with a great amount of f
iscal and professional authority.  We carefully
 
structured the f
inancial relationships t
o reflect the proper independence
 
of the Center in its investigation.  In particular, we insisted that
 
the financial arrangements not be on a cost-reimbursable basis, in
 
order t
o insure that the published analysis would not be subject to
 
financial veto.
 The project director will thus be free to assess
 
with candor the impact of the waterway on t
he traditional culture of
 
the region.
 
Third, I certainly agree that professional folklorists
 
should carefully examine the ethical implications of future Moss-
Bennett preservation work.
 But our professional f
ield has not yet
 
focused adequately on these issues and questions, and a demonstration
 
I
 
I
 
- 4 -
 
project of this magnitude will enable us t
o debate t
he issues
 
more intelligently on the basis of real experience.  There is no
 
question that t
he issues involved here warrant serious reflection.
 
I feel deeply that folklorists would be remiss in regarding the
 
preservation authority of the Moss-Bennett Act simply as the source
 
of a pot of money for professional aggrandizement.
 
Fourth, the federal coordinative role you cite i
s nowhere
 
expressed in the statutory law which established the Center.
 It was
 
much talked about before the creation of the Center, and it is im-
plicit in the structure of the Center's Board, but to the extent that
 
it has become clearly associated with the Center, it is in part because
 
of my own articulation of that function.
 In testimony I provided the
 
Congress during hearings in 1977, I named the first goal of the
 
Center as coordinative leadership of the field; the other two goals
 
I articulated then were assistance to the field and model projects  
in the field. 
I do not regard it as a function of the Center to
 
undertake random field projects.  Rather, I regard projects as one
 
means of attaining and reinforcing our coordinative and advocacy
 
role.  Thus it is that our two most recent projects have both been
 
undertaken in cooperation with agencies of the Department of the
 
Interior, which in my opinion furthers the policy goals I outlined
 
earlier.
 
Fifth, we have heard and have already responded to your
 
wise advice not to spread our professional staff too thinly around
 
the country.  Our recent projects have been carefully structured to
 
reduce the involvement of the permanent staff of the Center, and
 
the Tombigbee project will require less t
otal t
ime on the part of
 
our professional staff than our earlier projects.  A casual survey of
 
staff travel in recent months clearly demonstrates this trend within
 
the Center, and the issue was prominently discussed in the November
 
Board meeting.
 
In conclusion, I remain convinced that we share the same
 
goals and the same basic concept of the Center's functions.  Our
 
differences may be profound on the particular issue of a project
 
dealing with the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway, but they seem to be
 
differences on how t
o attain mutually shared goals.  The Folklife
 
Center is not set on any preordained or immutable course, and I should
 
be personally and professionally distressed if you did not continue
 
to share with us your vision.

Director, American Folklife Center
 
Library of Congress
 
Washington,  D.C. 20540
 
Dear Alan,
 
I have indeed been thinking about the
 
project recently, but my first concerns about
 
dilemma that it is began last fall.
 My worry
 
of the experiences we all had in Galax, where
 
the National Park Service had to be clarified
 
many local people;
 in fact,  there were still
 
great hostility towards the Park Service.
 
When I heard about the Tenn-Tom Project,  I thought instantly
 
that the fieldworkers on that project may face a good deal of diffi-
culty on account of any sort of official association with the U.S.
 
Army Corps of Engineers;  I uncritically worried about the whole issue
 
at a sort o
f proverbial level:  "If you go to bed with dogs, you'll
 
wake up with fleas."
 I believe that Archie Green is absolutely right
 
in posing deep questions about the project, and will try to articulate
 
my current thoughts on it.
 
First of all,  I too believe that the Waterway Project itself
 
is a porkbarrel project of questionable economic necessity in the
 
long run to anyone but the Corps of Engineers.
 I also believe, along
 
with Archie,  that individual folklorists should oppose such wasteful
 
and environmentally harmful projects whenevnr and wherever possible
 
through the kinds of organizations he names,  e.g.,  the Sierra Club.
 
However,  this waterway development project seems to be a fact
 
to be dealt with, already authorized by Congress,  so in a sense the
 
battle for the Tombigbee has been lost.
 The issue therefore revolves
 
around the general -ethical questions that can be directed at the
 
Moss-Bennett Act, and the American Folklife Center's mandate under
 
that Act, both in general and in particular on the Tenn-Tom.
 As far
 
as I am concerned,  "salvage archeology" -- and likewise,  "salvage
 
folklife research" -- is not inherently immoral or unethical,  though
 
one percent of the construction budget in many cases is too little
 
and too late.
 A critical factor in such research, however -- and
 
most especially in folklife research -- is the research agency's
 
obligation not only to "mitigate the adverse impact" of development,
 
but also to fully document and present to the development agency and
 
other concerned citizens the staggering human and cultural toll.
 There
 
should be a full account of the traditional human sensitivities and
 
expressions that get impersonally steamrollered in the course of such
 
projects, as well as of the anger and frustration of the local populace.
 
It is the local people among whom "salvage folklife research" is
 
conducted that suffer disruptions to their lives and traditions;
 the
 
agency doing the research therefore has a short-term obligation to
 
make the particulars of those disruptions a part of the official r6cord.
 
There is also,  I think, a long-term obligation,  to make clear to
 
Congress and the Corps of Engineers the significance and extent of
 
the harm they unquestionably do to human traditions as well as to
 
animal and plant life.
 It seems not at all unreasonable or unlikely
 
to me that the American Folklife Center,  following its participation
 
in the Tenn-Tom project, may be able to use both folklorists'  experience
 
Tennessee-Tombigbee
 
it as the ethical
 
grew naturally out
 
our position vis-a-vis
 
quite delicately to
 
those who expressed
 
2
 
and the statements of informants as ammunition for future battles
 
against other Army Corps of Engineers boondoggles.
 
I don't envy the Tenn-Tom Folklife Project fieldworkers
 
a bit; they will surely have a rougher time by far than we did in
 
the Blue Ridge.
 But I feel that Archie's fears of "awesome ethical
 
consequences," while justifiable in the long run,  should not obviate
 
the American Folklife Center's plans to proceed.
 His cautionary
 
words must be heeded, though, both during and after the project;
 
as he says, we simply cannot afford to "signal to the country at
 
large that folklorists are insensitive to land ethics and community
 
stability."
 
I believe firmly in the ethical integrity of myself and most
 
other professional folklorists.
 I think we can do folklife field-
work -- even of the "salvage" type -- which will incorporate at the
 
level of the individual fieldworker the kind of human sensitivity
 
needed to preclude our being misunderstood by "the country at large."
 
In fact, the country at large will mainly come to understand us in
 
the long run through contacts made at a folkloristically-appropriate
 
level: one-to-one, face-to-face.
 At that level,  there need be no
 
misunderstandings; fieldworkers should take the time to explain their
 
own conceptions of their work (
including the ethics of their work)
 
anyway.
 More often than not, the fieldworker's personal opposition
 
to huge impersonal government projects can be understood despite
 
his involvement with a Moss-Bennett "mitigation" of such a project.
 
It would be a good idea,  in this-respect,  for the members of the
 
Tenn-Tom field team to fully explore their own understandings of the
 
ethical issues here, both individually and as a team; perhaps they
 
should even draft some brief statements of those views before, during,
 
and after the project.
 Certainly such statements should become a
 
part of the American Folklife Center's official report on the Tenn-
Tom Project as well.
 
I hope all this helps somehow.
 This issue is a very serious
 
one, with no clear-cut answer; although I don't mean to,  I find myself
 
equivocating on it.
 If you proceed with the Tenn-Tom Folklife Project,
 
I know you won't be mere "body-counters," but then again, how much
 
can you really mitigate the impact of this or any other huge waterway
 
develot
:)ment?  I wish the Tenn-Tom development had bogged down where
 
it should have,  in Congress;
 since it apparently hasn't,  I think
 
you should proceed, but with all the cautions and ethical fears
 
out in the open all the way,  shared not only by Archie, yourself,
 
and a few others, but also by the American Folklore Society, Neil
 
Rosenberg and the members of the fieldwork team, and most of all
 
by the people who live along the Tombigbee River.

crely yours,

Dear Alan:
 
I have your l
etter of February 7
, together with the a
ccompanying copies
 
of Archie Green's January 30th letter and your response.  The i
ssues
 
raised in the exchange have concerned me for some time, and I welcome
 
the opportunity to discuss them.
 
Based on d
iscussions with my archeologist colleagues, I have l
ong thought
 
that impact a
ssessment would be a highly appropriate and productive a
ctivity
 
for folklorists to undertake.  Indeed, much of the language of the Folklife
 
Preservation Act was borrowed from earlier l
egislation that constitutes
 
part of the charter for the activity of archeologists in this area.  A few
 
folklorists that I know of, most notably Roger Welsch, have a
lready carried
 
out impact a
ssessment projects, and I would l
ike to see as much more work
 
of this kind open up as the traffic will bear.
 
Even further, I believe that the Folklife Center can perform a very useful
 
s
ervice to the profession by undertaking what amounts to a major pilot
 
project in the f
ield of impact assessment.  That is to say, I do not
 
support the argument that the Center should confine i
tself wholly to
 
Washington-focused activity to the exclusion of any direct engagement in
 
substantive projects e
lsewhere in the country.  I
t seems to me absolutely
 
essential, though, that every project i
n which the Center does involve
 
i
tself must be selected with extreme care, to ensure that i
t will serve as
 
a l
ead, or a model, or a s
tandard for further work of i
ts kind, and i
t i
s
 
for that reason that I think the Tennessee-Tombigbee project i
s extremely
 
i
ll-advised.
 
I won't go into a critique here of the Corps of Engineers Tenn-Tom
 
Waterway project; suffice i
t to say that I am fully persuaded that i
t i
s
 
an outrageous boondoggle, ecologically and culturally destructive, and
 
more important, so are increasing numbers of government officials,
 
journalists, members of the public, and folklorists.  The waterway project
 
i
s so heavily tainted that I fear the Center will not be able to avoid
 
being tainted i
tself by association with i
t.
 If the efforts to block
 
the construction of the waterway are unsuccessful, and you feel that the

folklife of the region must be documented before i
t i
s destroyed, then
 
l
et the Center s
erve as a base for the coordination of folklife fieldwork
 
in the region i
ndependent of Corps of Engineers/Interior sponsorship.
 
I am sure that other sources of funding could be found for such a venture.
 
Other c
leaner and more appropriate opportunities will present themselves
 
for the Center to  undertake a pilot impact assessment.  To be sure, many
 
government funded public works projects (
of the kind that are l
ikely to
 
generate funds for impact a
ssessment) provoke some degree of public
 
opposition, but with most of them the controversy remains at the l
evel
 
of honest disagreement between reasonable people.  Tenn-Tom has gone way
 
beyond that point.  The Center is in the privileged position of being
 
able to choose its projects; to go ahead with participation in Tenn-Tom
 
would be a serious mistake.

Dear Alan:
 
Since I know so little about the Folklife Center's Tombigbee River Project, I
 
cannot discuss it in an informed way.  I do know that I dislike the Corps of Engineers,
 
and from what I have read of the Tombigbee River Project proposEdby the Corps, I also
 
oppose it.  This does not mean, however, that I am against the Folklife Center's
 
project.  Your goal, as I understand it is to document folklife along the Tombigbee
 
River and to do what you can "to mitigate the adverse impact" of the water project
 
on the traditional life along the river.  Archie's view, as I understand it, is that by
 
having anything at all to do with the Waterway Project you have lent your support to
 
the enemy and are therefore not worthy of your hire.  I am troubled somewhat by
 
both these views, but especially by Archie's.
 
Archie wants folklorists to link arms with their "true allies," the Sierra Club
 
and other like-minded groups, and with them to join in combat with those government bodies
 
like the Corps of Engineers which are insensitive to "community stability" and which
 
disrupt "human communities."  That strikes me as a lofty but highly over-simplified
 
approach.  I can't speak for other parts of the country, but in the West such an
 
alliance seems almost impossible, unless one is highly selective in choosing those
 
"human communities"  he wishes to preserve.  The problem is that many traditional groups
 
are threatened as much by conservationists as they are by agencies like the Corps of
 
Engineers.
 
For example, since the Folklife Center has spent considerable t
ime and money
 
studying western ranching, I assume that the cow-calf operation carried on by independent
 
ranching families is one of the lifestyles deemed worthy of preservation.  Yet had I gone
 
into Paradise Valley last summer and admitted membership in the Sierra Club, I probably
 
would have been run out of town on a rail--look sometime at the anti-Sierra Club bumper
 
stickers ranchers pvsre on their trucks.  After all, it was the Sierra Club and other
 
conservation groups who were ultimately responsible for the increase of wild horses and
 
burros on the government grazing land despatately needed by hard pressed ranchers for
 
their own cattle.  Similarly, these same conservation groups have been responsible
 
for the increase in predators that have threated the livelihood of sheep ranchers through-
out the West.  I rather suspect these ranchers wish someone would speak up for their
 
"community stability."
 
In many people's eyes the real monster threatening to destroy the ranchers' traditional
 
lifestyple is the Bureau of Land Management.  But what many of us fail to realize is
 
that much of the BLM's present policy results not from any desire on the part of that
 
organization to harass the ranchers but from a successful suit brought against it by a
 
consortium of conservation organizations.  The result, as Les Stewart in Paradise
 
Valley points out, is that rangers themselves are likely to become an endangered
 
species.
 
To a certain extent, Alan, your desire to wed natural and cultural preservation
 
seems to me similar to Archie's desire to bring folklorists and conservationists
 
together.  And it seems fraught with the same difficulties.  For example, I
'm con-
vinced that the range land around Paradise Valley has been badly overgrazed.  It needs
 
to be restored, but, unfortunately, adequate restoration will probably mean the de-
struction of the traditional life style in the valley.  So which do you opt for,
 
preservation of the land or of the community?
 
What I am saying should not be taken as an attack on conservationists.  I have
 
long supported most of the programs of the Sierra Club.  I love the land out here.
 
But I also admire the people.  Many of my friends and part of my family are ranchers.
 
I am frequently torn as I try to balance my love for the land with my concern for the
 
lives of these people.  I guess all I am really sayii:g -is that the issues at -hand are
 
so complex
 the American Folklife Center ought to stay out of them.  To put
 
the weight of the Center behind one of the competing factions is to assume a position
 
of moral superiority which may finally prove destructive both to the Center and to the
 
people it wishes to serve.  As I come to opinions about what is right in these matters,
 
I
'll fight for them as vigorously as I can through the traditional  political processes.
 
But I
'll not attempt to make the American Folklife Center a social action group for my
 
own political-cultural persuasions; and I resent those who try to do it for theirs.
 
I am committed to cultural preservation, but in a way many of my fellow folklorists
 
will probably find repugnant.  While I was working in Paradise Valley, I became painfully
 
aware that no matter how I felt about it, and no matter what the American Folklife
 
Center chose to do or not do, life in the valley was going to change.  It thus seemed
 
to me that I could perform real service by documenting life at that moment as carefully
 
and as sensitively as possible.  This kind of commitment to documentation perhaps
 
makes me one of Archie's body counters, though I must confess I never saw myself in
 
that light.  I had met some people in the valley I had learned to like and I wanted
 
simply to recount (preserve if you will) the details of their lives.  I wish someone
 
had done the same for my parents on the Utah and Idaho homesteads where they grew to
 
adulthood.
 
I'm not sure any of this helps , Alan.  I'm not even sure it is to  the point.  I
 
may have used your invitation to air some of my own concerns rather than to help you
 
solve your problem.  If you want to know why I am so opposed to the mixing of
 
scholarly and political activity look sometime at my book Folklore and Nationalism
  
in Modern Finland. Though the American Folklife Center is a government agency, I
 
hope it will stay away from the kind of political activism Archie is encouraging.

Dear Alan:
 
Thank you for sharing with me Archie's letter to Rae Virginia, and your response to
 
it.
 I agree that the issue is a serious one and I have given it quite a bit of thought
 
since I received your letter yesterday.
 I have also asked a colleague to read the
 
letters and then discussed them at considerable length.
 (That colleague is not a
 
folklorist but rather a medical sociologist and,  therefore, basically an impartial
 
observer at least in terms of the disciplinary details.)  The whole thing is very
 
complicated and requires discussion more than correspondence.
 Nonetheless,  I thought
 
that I would put some basic reactions on paper now, and then I assume that there will
 
be time for discussion at the upcoming Board meeting.
 
First, there is a great deal that I do not yet know in terms of the exact wording
 
of the "Moss-Bennett Act" and the wording of your contract with Interior.
 Presumably
 
some of this is directly important to the questions at hand and my comments are all
 
subject to revision if I find myself working with inaccurate assumptions or inferences
 
about those documents.
 
Beginning with Archie's letter I think that I find two basic and rather different
 
sorts of arguments presented, and presented in such a way that they are somewhat
 
confused with one another.
 First,  there is an ethical argument that the project should
 
not be undertaken because it somehow relies on "bad money;" that is, that the funds for
 
the project carry with them some of the moral burden that the water project itself has
 
incurred.
 The second argument is to the effect that this sort of work - i
.e.  fieldwork
 
ought not be a major task of the Center anyway.
 
The ethical argument is one which I think is valid in some cases, but not in this
 
case as I understand the facts.
 The project you are undertaking will, as I understand
 
it, do three kinds of things:
 1
.
 basic folklore field work;
 2
.
 documentation of the
 
cultural impact of the water project; and 3
.
 efforts to mitigate the negative cultural
 
impact in whatever ways are feasible and appropriate.  Whether such an operation is
 
tainted by the initial source of the funding hinges, I should think, on whether or not
 
the project "benefits a Corps of Engineers project," as Archie states.  You have said that
 
you don't see how it could.
 I can see only one way, and that bears checking into.  Does
 
the work sponsored by the Moss-Bennett Act constitute window dressing?
 Is it a sort of
 
public relations effort which allows the Corps,  Interior or whomever to say:
 "Yes, we
 
know that there are some unfortunate consequences, but we are making all reasonable efforts
 
to mitigate those consequences.
 Therefore,  there should be less opposition to such
 
projects on the basis of negative
 
ulltural o t
tcomes."

perfectly.
 There is also another argument which I think should be marshalled here.
 
That is that if such a Center completely removed itself from fieldwork the consequences
 
would eventually be disastrous for both the image and the functioning of the Center.
 
Our discipline is inextricably bound to fieldwork at all levels.
 If the Center staff
 
were to be composed entirely of "arm chair folklorists," if it worked exclusively with
 
the results the fieldwork of others,  if it spent all of it's time dealing with
 
academicians, politicians and bureaucrats, it would very quickly lose both its
 
reputation and its substance as a legitimate force in folklore.
 
In summary,  then,  if I understand the legislation and your proposed project
 
correctly the situation is precisely as you have summed it up.
 Archie and the
 
Center are in agreement on all of the basics.
 In fact,  in very vigorous agreement.
 
That the conclusions flowing from those basics are diametrically opposed seems to
 
me to result from the strength of Archie's emotional response to the very idea of
 
the Corps of Engineers, and perhaps from a lack of thorough discussion with you
 
folks at the Center about the whole topic.
 This last seems not to be the case since
 
both you and Archie refer to considerable discussion, but it is hard to imagine how
 
ample discussion of this could leave so much disagreement.
 And finally,  I have heard
 
some others raise some of these questions, so perhaps some dissemination of the
 
information we are talking about here to the folklore community at large is called for.
 
Well, Alan,  this is only a beginning and no doubt reflects the fact that I still
 
need a good deal of additional information.
 But I
 thought it best to get something on
 
paper to you before next week's meeting so that whatever discussion of the topic we have
 
there will not have to start from scratch.
 I look forward to seeing you and the
 
Board in Washington.
 
Best wishes,

Dear Alan  :
 
I am in receipt of your copies o
f the correspondence between you and Archie Green
 
and the Smithsonian, and I thank you much for sending them.  I concur with much
 
of what you said in your replies.  Archie G
reen's letter most eloquently points
 
out very serious concerns, a
nd the Tennessee-Tombigbee project obviously is
 
politically delicate.  I
 do, however, feel that Archie is condemning the folkli fe  
project by association, and fails to see the true benefits which can come from
 
the project.
 
I personally tend to agree with Archie
 that Tenn-Tom is a "two-billion
 
dollar porkbarrel project."  He is also p
robably correct when he says that the
 
p
roject is "
destructive of human communities in rural America."  So are McDonalds,
 
strip mining, and the federal buraucracy.  As folklorists, we are essentially
 
d
ocumenters.  That documentation may serve to "
preserve," but I think we may be
 
a bit pompous to think that we can have any real effect on the "preservation" o
f
 
traditional culture.  Culture is adaptive,  and our role in that adaptive change
 
process is minimal.
 
Coal going to Japan, environmental destruction, and waste of taxpayers' money
 
are very real concerns, but should these issues concern us as folklorists, or
 
should they concern us as individuals.  The Viet Nam War and strip-mining were
 
major concerns, but my opposition to both would not have kept me from documenting
 
Viet Nam war lore, and d
id not keep me from documenting the traditional culture of
 
a Kentucky community waiting to be "stripped" off the face of the earth.
 
True, the F
 olklife Center has a funding arrangement with the Corps of Engineers,
 
but weren't such arrangements anticipated in the formation of a federally-funded
 
folklife agency.  I
f we are going to place folklife in the federal government
 
realm, we must tackle the responsibilities that go with being part of the federal
 
government.  The federal government operates on a system of checks and balances.
 
The Corps of Engineers, The Department of the I
nterior, The Environmental Protection
 
Agency, and the Department of Energy, obviously h
ave different o
pinions to issues
 
and approaches to problems.
 
The Moss-Bennett Act was obviously not generated by the Corps o
f Engineers.  It was
 
generated by those wishing to place checks and responsibilities on the activities of

Corps.  I
t seems clear to me that for archaeologists, historians, or folklorists
 
to ignore the utilization of Moss-Bennett is to abandon the entire concept of
 
Moss-Bennett, a concept that I would assume most folklorists concur with.  And
 
the American Folklife Center, in abandoning its responsibilities to implementation
 
of Moss-Bennett, is ignoring its responsibilities as a federal folklife agency.
 
I would concur with Archie Green that the Corps of Engineers' projects do not
 
present the Corps as a g
roup allied with the mission of the American Folklife
 
Center.  That is precisely why this funding is coming through Moss-Bennett.
 
Simply stated, Moss-Bennett forces the C
orps to funnel funds in d
irections where
 
it wouldn't if it didn't have to.
 
This is the  first time that folklorists have been taken as seriously as
 
archaeologists and historians; but, more importantly, this is the first time
 
that the culture of living, breathing people has been taken as seriously as the
 
culture of those long dead.
 
Speaking as an A
 labam
llan, Greene, Sumter, and Pickens Counties are counties with
 
a deep history of deprivation, from plantation life to share-cropping to
 
widespread poverty.  The people of this area have seen federal program after
 
federal program .
.. all insensitive to their culture and to their needs.  The
 
Waterway project is the latest of these federal projects, whose stated benefits
 
to the a
rea will more than likely never be realized.  To those I have talked to,
 
the proposed folklife project is something quite d
ifferent.  There is almost a
 
suspicious d
isbelief that a federal agency would take an interest in documenting,
 
preserving, celebrating their traditional culture.  I
s it not the responsibility
 
of a federal folklife agency to somehow temper or minimize the effects of other
 
federal projects which are "destructive to human communities?"  Perhaps folklorists
 
are not quite ready for such lofty responsibilities.  This may well be true.
 
But if it is true, then we are also not quite ready for a federal folklif
-e center.
 
Where I disagree with Archie Green's letter the most is in his implication that
 
the folklife p
roject would "signal to the country at large that folklorists are
 
insensitive t
o land eithics and community stability."  I feel, quite to the contrary,
 
that this project would signal folklorists very real concern for these issues.
 
The decision on the Tenn-Tom folklife project is a critical one.  T
aking on the
 
project will initiate the involvement of folklorists in major cultural-political
 
issues, most probably leading to major cultural impact work in the future.  Not
 
taking on the p
roject, I think, will indicate our unwillingness, or lack of
 
readiness, t
o get involved with such issues.
 
This is the real issue.  The Moss-Bennett avenue of funding makes it quite clear
 
we are notwedding ourselves to the Corps.
 The question is do we want to get in the
 
political cultural-impact arena, and, if so, should the American Folklife Center
 
be the vehicle for entering this arena.  This decision, I guess, is up to those
 
who define, interpret, and shape the purpose and d
irection of the Center.

Dear Alan:
 
Thank you for sharing copies of your exchange with Archie Green; Z
 
welcome the chance to add my comments to what may hopefully be a lively
 
and productive debate.
 
First, I want to make it clear that I share fully Archie's malaise
 
about the Corps of Engineers and about t
he Tenn.-Tom project and about t
he
 
projected uses for th e waterway
. To that let me add that I have sim il ar  
feelings about the Bureau of Indian Affairs generally, the Park Service
 
in some particulars, the U.S. Forest Ser•iice and Bureau of Lund Management
 
in many respects, and about virtually every government operation which deals
 
with the manipulation of people and cultures.  The continued retention of
 
the Modoc skulls and countless other confiscated sacred objects and body parts
 
by the Smithsonian Institution is less outrageous than the Tenn-Tom project
 
only in scope; the morality on which they are based i
s essentially the same.
 
Virtually everything the gover ment does has an impact on the fragile
 
networks of folk tradition which provide stability, order, sense, and logic
 
for the countless close groups which people our land.  To overlook this i
s t
o
 
deal with Indian reservation "termination" as if it were s
imply a matter of
 
land use and real estate pricing; to dismiss Indian fishing rights cases as
 
simply matters of fish population; to view dam building, fire suppression,
 
national Park establishment and so on as if they had n
o relation t
o the fabrics
 
of heritage and tradition built up over years among the peoples thereby affected.
 
Folklorists can, as Archie suggests, keep themselves aloof from such nasty
 
considerations as these and pretend by not being there on the spot that they
 
bear no political responsibility for what our government does.  They can
. take
 
safe jobs in Washington and argue blue collar intere i
s whLle wearing white
 
shirts and ties.  They can construct delicate coordinative networks with
 
bureaucratic interchanges of folkloristic interest and pretend that tnezr
 
taxes are not paying for Tenn-Tom or some similar abomination.  But I see no
 
reason, moral or professional, why they should.
 
In fact, I feel the greatest mistake we could commit at t
his point i
n history
 
would be to allow such a project as the Tern-Tom to take place without f
olklorists
 
being present a

traditional life, and b) to help nurture and protect whatever aspects of
 
tradition we as professionals  can recognize and be articulate about.  One
 
eventual result :
night be that before such projects are undertaken, folklorists
 
will be asked to apply their expertise.  Another result might be that people
 
in this country will st art to take fo lkl ore  ser
iously,
 as  if  it  has  to do with
 
real life, not just with elite scholarly games.
 
Just as I don't believe those who tried to bail out the Titanic
 
necessarily loved the captain or admired the shipowner, I do not believe
 
that folklorists and anthropologists who work on Indian reservations show
 
thereby that they support and approve of the degradation, deprivation and
 
disorientation which are the government sponsored ingredients of life there.
 
I do not believe that archaeologists "salvaging" relics from sites to be
 
flooded are sho=wing their nonchalance about dam building.  I do not believe
 
that the anthropologists who worked in the Jap anese
 American concentration
 
camps condoned the barbarism of "relocation."  Without the work of these
 
people we would know nothing about these people and, more dismally, we could
 
comfortably ignore the effects of what we did (
and do) to them.
 
Perhaps it is clear by now that I support the idea of folklorists being
 
willing -- indeed obligated -- to get mud on their shoes, and I therefore
 
support the Centar's involvement in the Tenn-Tam project.  If we had the
 
money and per.sonna_
' I would want us on every such project from the t
1m
.- it
 
was first discus
s.  It is only fair to point out, however, that the results
 
of the fieldwork will have to be brutally honest in their presentation and
 
analysis or else  -e Center will have lost its credibility.  If the eL
,
,d results
 
are a few booklets on the "quaint-arts-and-crafts-which-once-flourished-here-
in-this-:ior
.�m?nt- u-man's-po;per-ovzr-ratura," a show of quilts, a fen whistles,
 
and an old man -whe sings ballads and plays fiddle for the tourists up at the
 
Visitor Center, then people in the folklore profession will conclude that you
 
are in the Corps of Engineers' hind pocket (
or thereabouts).
 
The potential goes far beyond this, as I know you are aware.  On the
 
one hand, you may be a
ide to show so vividly the cultural disaster that
 
accompanies such a major project that the Corps may wish it had never heard
 
of t
he Center.  Your Mork nay be used by activists for years to cone, for
 
Lney n od to show there is more to the opposition against darns than mere
 
Sierra Club opinionation.  On the o th er  han d
, to  be fair, you may find --
saints preserve us -- that there is no cultural effect at all in such a project,
 
and that the prophecies of disaster and betrayal are mainly political, not folk-
loristic.
 I
'm inclinad to think (and hope) that the former is more likely than
 
the latter.  But in either case, I
'm solidly convinced that if folklorists are
 
not involved we will end up where we are now, knowing nothing but our own
 
opinions.
 
If we give in to a fear of being involved, then indeed we might as well
 
accept that well-worn image of ourselves as antiquarian preservationists, ever
 
conversationally on the side of Right as we quietly and unobtrusively play with
 
our corn-cob pipes, duck decoys, love songs, quilts, and other unobjectionables.
 
I for one hope for something more meaningful -- and less boring -- than
 
one more office in Washington making the rounds to insure that the Washington
 
-3-
conversation stays coordinated and  virtuous.
 
Sincerely,
 
arre Toelken

I
 have rcad your reply to Archie Green concerning the Center's
 
i

 f
ind i

and specific.  I
 agree with i
ts content and tone co mpletely.  I
t assures me
 
that you are t
he r
ight person to be i
n charge of the A merican Folklife
 
Center.
 
These are my feelings, despite the fact that I
 share with Archie
 
serious concern about the way that this and other such boondoggles are
 
apparently s
lipping through the net t
hat President Carter pro mised us would
 
i
nterrupt the m.  Here i

irst
 
on his hit l
ist and i
s no w again moving forward, dei�troying trout s
trea ms,
 
wildlife habitat, and a few cultural s
ites a
long the way.
 
As a folklorist, I
 think my reaction to a survey project on the
 
CUP would parallel yours on Tenn -To m: I
f the da mn-da m thing does f
inally
 
co me to pass, then i
t i
s better to have a professional survey of what i
s lost
 
than to have an i
nco mplete record or none a
t a
ll.  One would hope that the
 
values d
iscovered i
n such a survey might have so me effect on future projects
 
that thrcaten our heritage, whether natural or cultural.
 
I
 feel that Archie makes two o
ther funda mental false assu mptions
 
t
hat your reply does not d
iscuss.  First, he suggests that folklorists as such
 
should join and support conservation and preservation groups; I
 feel that
 
i
ndividual concerned c
itizens should do t
his, quite apart fro m their
 
occupational or professional roles.  As scholars, we should be objective.
 
This lcads to the second point, that Archie urges an advocacy role for you,
 
your agency, and presu mably for folklorists i
n general.  Here too I
 feel t
hat
 
political action--fro m lobbying to protests and beyond--does not befit a
 
scholarly group except i
nsofar as specifically professional matters are concerned.
 
Obviously i
t would take a gnat many more pages for me to
 
argue and support my general rc-3ctions to t
he exchange of correspondence you
 
sent.  Pressures of teaching, editing, and rescarch prevent that at t
his t
i me,
 
so I
 hope t
his sketchy reply i
s useful.

Dear Alan,
 
Thanks for sending me copies of Archie Green's letter to
 
Raye Virginia Allen (
January 30) and your letter to Archie (
Feb-
ruary 5
).  I
've read through them many times and welcome the
 
chance to pass along my own thoughts on this Tennessee-Tombigbee
 
dilemma.
 
I was very sorry to read that Archie plans to withdraw com-
pletely from the Center.  That's a loss for us all.  Considering
 
how much of his life and wisdom he put into the Center's creation,
 
the decision must have been as painful as any he's ever made.
 
:
Maybe because my own life has been concentrated elsewhere, I'm
 
not ready to take that drastic a step.  I
tm glad to help you get
 
the ethnic re
'cordings manuscript into production, for instance,
 
because I see that as a positive contribution by the Center, part
 
of its function and duty.  On the other hand, because the Tenn-
Tom project seems to me to promise more negative than positive
 
results, I can't bring myself to speak for it.
 
The central issue is the American iolklife Center's participa-
tion in an Army Corps of Lngineers project.  Who approached whom
 
about this project is beside the point.  While the Corps might not
 
benefit financially from the folklife project, it would benefit
 
in terms of implied sanction, first by the Center and by extension
 
by the folklore community.  The larger spcnsorship of the '
Depart-
ment of the Interior, through the Heritage Conservation
. and Recrea-
tion Service, does not remove the Corps's involvement.
 
The Tenn-Tom issue was brought home to me in a way I hadn't
 
anticipated, when Neil Rosenberg asked whether I would consider
 
joining the projectts staff.  I have to admit that I felt honored
 
to be asked, and initially the offer was very attractive indeed,
 
because it would have meant doing work I like (
archiving, editing,
 
researching), with people I respect, in a part of the country
 
that interests me a great deal.  Some of the negative aspects
 
could have been worked out (
going on leave so soon again, being
 
away from home and husband).  But the one nagging element that I
 
knew would stay with me long after Tenn-Tom was finished and
 
all the archiving and editing was out of the way was that asso-
ciation with the Lrmy Corps of Engineers, with all that implied.

Given my observations of the harm and unhappiness the Corps has
 
caused elsewhere, I don't wish to have anything similar on either
 
my personal or my professional conscience.
 
In my experience, the Army Corps of Engineers is essentially
 
a destructive agency.  Locally, for example, we had a long debate
 
over a project that would have destroyed parts of Allerton Park,
 
a unique preserve, in return for uncertain water-supply benefits
 
that could have been obtained i
n cheaper and more straightforward
 
ways.  For another example, when I was a student at Indiana in
 
the early 1960s, I did a fair amount of fieldwork in the country-
side around Bloomington, and I have never forgotten the bitterness
 
1 encountered among people who were being displaced, or whose
 
friends and relatives were being displaced, because of dam construc-
tion.  I don't think that my depositing collectanea in the Indiana
 
archives, or producing an LF of their music, or mounting a photo
 
exhibition o
f their homes and farms, or any other "
development of
 
products" could ever have made up for the losses and insecurity
 
forced upon them.  I suspect that the money set aside by the l
Koss-
Bennett Act goes farther to mitigate twinges of governmental
 
conscience than it does to mitigate "
the adverse impact of water
 
projects on scientific and cultural resources in the area."
 
Your goal of enlightening the Department of the Interior is
 
commendable.  But aren't there more constructive ways to do this?
 
Arentt there more positive Interior agencies the Center could work
 
with?  Could the same kind of survey have been done in the same
 
area, but without Corps affiliation?  :
,c
ould it not demonstrate
 
more respect for folk culture if the Center had chosen to document
 
its viability, to argue that it should be,allowed to survive on
 
its own terms, rather than to assume its inevitable disruption
 
and to participate only after the fact?
 
You made a very pertinent observation in your letter to Archie,
 
that professional folklorists ought to examine carefully the
 
ethical implications of getting involved with projects like Tenn-
Tom.  Even though the Center's board of trustees has discussed this
 
at length, and some of us in the American Folklore Society have
 
had the chance to talk with you about it, sometimes it takes more
 
public debate and unhappy confrontation to bring an issue into real
 
focus.  I wonder if your board ought not take a hard, fresh look
 
at the project and decide whether it really is in the interests of
 
the Center to participate after all.  While the Center would gain
 
the funds to carry out a large project, presumably with some
 
Alan Jabbour
 
February 19, 1979
 
Page 3
 
tangible products to show for it, and Interior would have some
 
better notion of what folklorists do, I
'm afraid that the distress
 
generated, among both folklorists and the folk, threatens to far
 
outweigh those benefits.  You've put a lot of personal effort and
 
commitment into Tenn-Tom, and that's bound to make it hard for
 
you to even think about withdrawing.  But if, in light of all
 
the supplementary debate and the threat of real harm to the Center,
 
the board concluded that this isn't the best of all possible
 
projects, then you could with good reason tell Interior Thanks-but-
no-thanks, and all concerned would respect you for that.  I hope
 
you'll ask your board to advise you afresh what to do.
 
You also referred to living folk cultural traditions.  The
 
environmental issue is serious enough.  In the long run, though,
 
it's what happens to people's lives that matters--and not just
 
the people who are the subject of study.  F
low should we feel about
 
taking part in changes that have not been proven necessary?  Does
 
it harden us"to assume that those changes are inevitable?  Does
 
it destroy us, too, just a little if we decide that this kind of
 
last-chance fieldwork is justified?  I care about what happens
 
to the people along the Tennessee-Tombigbee iaterway, and I care
 
about you and Neil and nrchie and our other colleagues who are
 
taking whatever stand on this issue.  It troubles me to see so
 
much dissension--my pacifist upbringing coming out, perhaps--and
 
so much imminent damage.  Is it worth it?  Is it really too late
 
to reconsider the whole project?

I appreciate the opportunity to contribute my thoughts to the
 
discussion about the Tombigbee River project and the AFC's involve-
ment.
 I would 
- to qualify my remarks
 
have not 
-
 ...
 -
 ad-
dress
 
considerations that attended the formation of the Center.
 I am
 
reacting out of my own experience 
doing fieldwork
e South,
 
in discussing and formulating policy at the state level, and in
 
functioning as a humaniat and a folklorist.
 
With serious reservations, I support the Center's involvement
 
in this project.
 That is, I think the potential benefits out-
weigh the considerable dangers.
 
It looks like there are two issues here.
 One is the morality
 
of the Center's getting involved with the Tombigbee River project.
 
The other is the broader question of what direction the Center
 
should take in implementing its randate;
 i.e., whether to work as
 
ad advocate within the federal structure, or to work more directly
 
"in the field" across the country.

to do with this broader problem of Corps activity;  in fact,  the very
 
vehicle that makes possible the AFC survey--Moss-Bennett--may be
 
seen as an opening round in a reevaluation of Corps activity.
 
I have stressed the word logically in the last paragraph, and
 
stressed it for a reason.
 Many people are going to react to this
 
situation emotionally;
 there is no getting around it.
 Thus, regard-
less of how tight the syllogisms are, the Center is going to suffer a
 
certain amount of "moral contamination" from undertaking this work.
 
The extent of this is hard to assess;  it depends on a number of things,
 
including the degree to which folklorists today can accept the prag-
matism necessary to function in a non-academic or public sector
 
environment.
 I have seen at least one state level folklore position
 
go down the tubes in part because of an inflexibility of attitude,
 
and I suspect there are others.
 It depends on the political stances
 
of our colleagues:
 through the sixties it has been traditionally
 
"liberal"  (
whatever that means), but I see evidence that this too is
 
changing--not toward traditional conservatism but yet a third position,
 
as yet undefined and unlabelled.
 
One therefore has to weigh the "moral contamination" against the
 
practical and the
 c retical benefit, and I think the latter outweighs
 
the former:
 the risk is worth taking.
 
The second issue--the direction that the center should take--is
 
a much broader policy matter.
 Certainly by doing model field projects,
 
you are working toward establishing links in Washington.
 But there is
 
also the added benefit that you are making other people around the
 
country aware not so much of the Center, but of folklore as a legiti-
mate area for study, and as a professional discipline that touches on
 
the "real" world.
 
A final concern which has to be inserted into the debate somewhere
 
is the people along the Tombigbee River, the people themselves.
 This
 
thing is going to interrupt their lives, and destroy certain cultural
 
patterns, and some attempt should be made to document or salvage some
 
of this.
 It's too easy to lose track of the people involved--the
 
subjects of the projects--and to see them only as means to an end:
 i.e.,
 
"strengthing" the Center in Washington circles, or "contaminating" it
 
in AFS circles.
 How about arguing that the project needs to be done
 
because we can learn from it, and because it can help us understand
 
ourselves more?
 
Sincerely,

Dear Alan:
 
I read with interest the correspondence between Archie
 
Green and you concerning the Tennessee-Tombigbee Project.  When
 
you informed me of the Folklife Center's involvement in this
 
project, my first reaction as a person concerned with the
 
environment was negative;  I
've read too many things about the
 
Corps of Engineers' destructive policies toward the environ-
ment.
 I also feared that association with the Corps would
 
be bad for the public image of the Center.
 However, after
 
you explained to me theexact nature of the Center's role in
 
preserving folklife along the Waterway,  I became convinced
 
that it was right and proper that the Center continue its
 
involvement in the Project.
 
I hope the positive aspects of the Folklife Center's work
 
can be as lucidly explained to environmentalists as your letter
 
to Archie did.
 I noticed that Carl had some photographs in
 
the last i
ssue of Environmental Action, and that might be a
 
good place to begin the public relations campaign with the
 
environmental movement.
 I do agree with Archie that they are
 
our natural allies.
 
Feel free to make this letter public, and if I can be of
 
any further service, let me know.
 
Cordially 
 yours,

If you have ever wondered about the meaning of the proverb
 Good intentions
 
lead to hell", you need to ponder about it no more.
 The involvement of the
 
American Folklife Center in the Tenn-Tom project was conceived and nurtured with
 
all the possible well--meanings and intentions, yet it results in a most complex
 
case in which questions of ethics and scholarship are intertwined, and the issues
 
involved are of such magnitude that they will dwarf the ERA question that
 
embroiled the Society during the last two years.
 
Unfortunately,  I do not have any crystal ball that will enable me to see the
 
right course of action.
 I am struck by the inteqrity of your intentions, yet I
 
am aware of the ethical  implications of the project which Archie is
 
pointing out 
Perhaps the "guilt" with which he charges the Center results from  association
 
with a culprit, rather than from the actual commission of unethical acts.
 However'
 
highly visible public offices should be sensitive to such relations.
 
My immediate advice would be to follow the ideas that you articulate toward the
 
end of your letter  (
pp,  3-4). namely allowing folklorists to express their opinions
 
about the ethical implications of the Moss-Bennett preservation work in general
 
and the Tenn-Tom project in particular . 
Perhaps, if Archie agrees, you should
 
make your letters public, printing them in the Newsletter, and solicit reactions
 
to them,
 Later we can have a debate in the next annual meeting.
 I think that
 
the Board should have a discussion about the subject as well.
 Through public,
 
debates and exchanges of ideas it would be possible for us to clarify the issues,
 
to define the problems and perhaps to formulate a policy that would guide our
 
actions in this new era in which folklore moves from the academic shelter into the
 
open arena of public affairs.

Dear Alan:
 
Your reply to Archie Green was well-couched and persuasive.  Now
 
that you have taken your stand and made your arrangements, I
 
think it would be a great mistake if your board reversed its
 
decision.
 
My reservations on the project would be on intellectual rather
 
than moral grounds, if I were to raise questions.
 Since I
 
really know very little about the project, I restrict myself
 
to the comment that in listening to both you  and Archie, and
 
reading both your letters, I find yoir position the more convincing.
 
The two main objections to your involvement--that the project
 
is contaminated, and that you can't handle such a large sum--have
 
nothing to do with each other, and weaken the criticism by
 
being lumped together.
 
This does
 not m  n that I f
i ve much confidence in your board.

I am enclosing with this memo a packet of xeroxed copies of
 
letters which came in to me after the Board meeting, commenting on the
 
Tennessee-Tombigbee project.  The letters continue to arrive, but
 
perhaps the initial flurry is nearing its end, making this a good
 
occasion to take stock.  The Board already has copies of letters which
 
arrived before the meeting.
 
Several Board members asked what had been sent and to whom.
 
What I sent out was a xerox of Archie Green's letter of January 30, 1979
 
t
o Raye Virginia Allen and a xerox of my reply t
o Archie of February 2
,
 
1979.
 Attached t
o them was a brief cover letter, a sample of which
 
I am enclosing.
 
The pair of letters was sent to the Executive Board of the
 
American Folklore Society, the chairmen of the various graduate programs
 
of folklore, and a few other people who had expressed interest in the
 
project and the debate.
 In addition to the letters there have of course
 
been many telephone calls commenting on the issues.
 
To me this correspondence is far and away the most promising
 
outgrowth of our Tennessee-Tombigbee debate.
 I
t reveals a profession for
 
the first time seriously engaged by the issues we raised, thoughtful and
 
reflective, ready to examine the matter in its every aspect in preparation
 
for future action.
 If there is a single issue which recurs regularly
 
in the letters, it is the concern that we create structures which assure
 
the professional field of independence of inquiry.
 I feel very strongly
 
that it is our duty to promote further reflection on the subject within
 
the professional field.
 I sense that the profession is ready to grapple
 
seriously with this subject, and that the grappling will both enrich the
 
profession and prepare it for future undertakings.
 
Accordingly, I shall be speaking on the subject at every occasion
 
that presents itself in coming months.
 In particular, it is certain to
 
be discussed at a conference on "Folklore and the Public Sector" at Western
 
Kentucky University on April 12-14.
 If any of you are able to attend, it would
 
most likely be a useful experience.  Looking farther ahead, several people
 
I
 
- 2 -
 
have already proposed organizing a formal discussion of the Moss-Bennett
 
Act and related federal subjects at the annual meeting of the American
 
Folklore Society in Los Angeles.
 
I am writing to everyone who has written me on the subject
 
to solicit their permission for circulation of the letters they sent.
 
The archivist in me tells me that these letters constitute a modest
 
historic outpouring, and there will be demand for them.  Please t
o not

Memo
 
Telephone call received by Carl Fleischhauer
 
2-23-79
 
From: Kenneth Goldstein
 
Folklore Dept
 
Univ of Pennsylvania
 
Professor Goldstein said he wished to express his firm and complete
 
support of the position outlined by Alan Jabbour in his letter to
 
Archie Green.
 He said he felt Archie Green's argument was not cogent,
 
and said that if sensitive, thinking folklorists did not perform these
 
tasks that probably the "Army" would with disastrous results.
