WE MET BY CHANCE. 
Music by W . 
H. 
BROCKWAY. Words by JEPPE DELANO, and sung by 
the Great DELANO'S. The Hit Everywhere. 
—:0:— 
How oft while walking in the park, 
I've seen the sweetest face; 
It passes me when just at dark, 
Close by a 
flowery place; 
Oh, how I'd love to see her now, 
And have a 
pleasant chat; 
But then, you see, I 
dare not speak, 
So I 
only raise my hat. 
Her form is of a 
classic mould, 
Her dress, the latest style; 
Her hair is wealth untold, 
She has a 
winning smile; 
I'm sure that she will stroll this way, 
Before the day is o'er; 
And if she does, I 
think I'll say, 
I 
know we've met before. 
CHORUS: 
We met by chance before, 
And in those eyes so bright; 
For me I 
feel there's love in store, 
Oh, won't it be delight; 
When to her I 
shall tell, 
Of love forever more; 
And say, I'm sure, I 
think 'tis well. 
That we have met before. 
4 
WE MET BY CHANCE—CoxnsuED. 
The other eve while in the park, 
The fragrant air to seek; 
I 
met a 
very nobby chap, 
Who passed, but did not speak; 
He looked as if he'd like to stop, 
And loiter for a 
chat; 
And would, if I 
had let him, 
So in passing tipped his hat. 
Oh, there he is, how nice he looks, 
I've often seen that face; 
At matinees, I 
think, 
Or at some watering place; 
I 
wish that he would speak to me, 
This silence I 
abhor; 
I 
think he's very charming, 
And I 
know we've met before, 
He.— I'd really like to speak to her, 
But then I 
would not dare; 
She might get angry, and 
Give me a 
cold and haughty stare. 
She.—Frn sure he's very bashful, 
But I 
wish he'd speak to me; 
I 
know he wants to dreadfully, 
That I 
can plainly see. 
He.— I'll muster up my courage now, 
And something to her say; 
She.—I 
think he's very odd, 
He might just say good day. 
Both.—Oh. what's the fun of flirting, 
And keep silent ever more; 
I 
don't think it exactly right, 
When we have met before.

DOWN BY THE OLD MILL STREAM. 
Words by Gus W ILLIAMS expressly for JEPPE and FANNIE DELANO, 
--: 
0 :----
I'm in love with a 
pretty little charmer, 
And Agnes is her name; 
And if she don't return the feeling, 
I'm sure I'll go insane; 
She's got the sweetest, brightest eyes, 
That ever yet was seen; 
And where I 
met this charming little pet, 
Was down by the old Mill Stream. 
CHORUS: 
Down by the old Mill Stream, 
There many happy hours I've seen; 
Strolling day by day the time I 
pass away, 
Down by the old Mill Stream. 
She. —Last week while I 
was out a 
walking, 
I 
met a 
nice young man; 
He looked to me so very loving, 
Forget him I 
never can; 
He is good-looking, and stylish, too, 
The idol of my dream; 
I 
promised to meet him here to- night, 
And stroll by the old Mill Stream. (Chorus). 
He.—Good evening, I 
see you've kept your promise, 
' And I 
now confess my love; 
If we marry, I'm sure ' tis you I'll cherish, 
I 
declare it by all above. 
She.—Indeed, you must go and ask papa, 
He.—Where does he live my Queen; 
She.—Right over yonder in that house, 
That stands by the old Mill Stream. 
(Chorus), 
Sung by the DELA.NO'S, JEPPE and FANNIE. 
My grandfather's clock was all very well, 
When the song was first corning out; 
It was whistled and sung till its numbers now swell 
On ears that are all tired out; 
It is sung, it is hummed, it is played, it is drummed 
On the streets it is whistled at its best; 
Let us stop, short, and never sing it again, 
Let's give the poor song a 
rest. 
CHORUS: 
Ninety years they are singing, tick, tick, tick, tick, 
It's all in your eye, then, tick, tick, tick, tick, 
We'll s:op, short, and never sing it again, 
Or we 
war the poor song out. 
I 
took my girl one day, 
The song starts off this way, 
And Emma was the darling female's name; 
Let's sing of Sue and Sal, 
Or any other gal, 
To sing so much of Em. we are to blame. 
CHoitus: 
For 'tis whoa Emma! whoa, Emma, 
How we can stop it now, is our dilemma; 
Say Emma! hey Emma! 
Why did you come to bother us so? 
MIXED —CONTINUED. 
I'll sing a 
song that's all the rage, 
Its running wild, in fact; 
It affected folks of every age, 
From Maine to Kalimasack; 
But those who sing the song all day, 
And make us all insane; 
They had better right away 
Shut up on this refrain. 
Johnny Megan, break his organ, 
His father bust the drum; 
His sister lost the tambourine, 
The brother don't tom, torn, torn. torn; 
Any more on his ham-bone, 
He blew himself sky high; 
The poor old band is busted up, 
We'll let the old swig-

She.— 
I 
wonder where he's gone to, 
Nobby Gussy, dear; 
lIe. — Ha, ha! 
Little Robin tell Kitty I'm coming, 
Yes, tell her I'll be there at four; 
She.—That's his voice. 
I've been waiting for more than a 
hour, 
Yes, waiting and watching for you; 
Ile.— 
She.—Well: 
He.— 
She.— 
But they say you love another, 
And my dream of joy is o'er. 
I 
want to be somebody's darling, 
I'm tired of living alone; 
If I 
only knew his name, 
If I 
only knew his name; 
Do be careful, do be careful, 
They might see you and me too; 
And that would be too bad. 
lie. —But this fellow— 
He calls you sweet and tender names, and 
She.—What if he does? 
I'm the girl that stands no nonsense, 
Stands no nonsense;no not I; 
MEDLEY. —CONTINUED. 
He.—I 
want you to understand: 
I'm a 
very nice young man, 
And wear such nobby clothes— • 
Yes, yes, ' tis very plain to see, 
That you are very nobby; 
But you are not the man for me. 
He.—Can she mean it? 
Must we then meet as strangers, 
After my dream of love? 
She.— 
Give me a 
jolly fellow, 
Who's always full of fun; 
A 
careless, don't care sort of a 
chap, 
A wealthy banker's son. 
He.— I'll tix him. 
Take this letter to your lover, 
He'll reply if he's got any pluck. 
She.— Oh, pshaw! 
He isn't a 
marrying man you know, 
He loves every girl that he meets. 
He.—I'm so glad. 
For I 
dream of you where'er I 
go, 
I 
never can forget. 
Oh, a 
very sly young Quakeress am I, 
And they call me pretty little Ruth; 
And they say 'tis wrong for me to laugh and 
flirt, 
And enjoy the merry time of youth. 
MEDLEY. 
—CONTINUED. 
He.—Oh, my! 
Let's keep the music ringing, 
For it makes me feel so good; 
And if I 
make a 
slight mistake, 
And you should think me rude, 
Why then I'd say— 
She.—And I 
would say— 
I'm the greatest girl in town, 
That's what the people say; 
Because I 
laugh and sing— 
He.—That's the girl for me. 
Little dark eyes do you love me, 
Will you still be true to me; 
Come and whisper— 
Tra, la, in, George, tra, la, la, George, 
You must go and ask papa, George. 
He.—She don't care, I'll make her think I'm going. 
Mollie, darling, now good-bye, 
To Chicago I 
must go; 
Twill nearly break my heart to leave you, 
And still I 
cannot live here so. 
She.—I've been fooling him. 
Gussy, darling, do not leave me, 
Do not leave me, Mollie, dear, 
She loves none other, Gussy, darling, 
Say you will not leave me here; 
If I 
ever spoke a 
harsh word, 
Gussy, darling, now forgive; 
For I 
love you best of all, 
Both.— 
Both — 
She— 
Both.— 
She.— 
He.— 
Both. — 
MEDLEY.
— CONTINUED. 
Yes, I 
love you best of all. 
Oh, yes, my dearest darling, 
I 
love you best of all. 
Now we'll wed and settle down, 
Buy a 
farm just out of town; 
- 
We'll live happy, 
Yes, as happy as can be. 
Go to bed at eight o'clock, 
No more clubs or a 
night lock; 
No more flirting either, with the girls, for me 
Live on bread and milk and cheese, 
We will surely take our ease. 
If by chance things go amiss, 
We will right them by a 
kiss; 
That's the way we've done, 
When we have quarreled before. 
Meet by chance no more in fun, 
For our flirting days are done. 
With the peals of wedding bells, 
They'll come no more; 
Now, kind friends, upon us call, 
We will be at home to all, 
And be just as pleased 
To see you as before.

MAKING LOVE BY MOONLIGHT. 
Words and Music by J. K. JOHNSON. 
Sung by the Great DELANO'S, JEPPE and FANNIE. 
Moonlight softly beaming, loving words are teeming, 
Sentiment fraught with fondest love and true; 
Delightful hours beguiling, the while she's sweetly smiling 
Entrancing him with wondrous eyes of blue; 
Gazing at him merrily, as she chats so cheerily, 
Entwining him with a 
spell he can't resist; 
Picking lilies and roses, assuming pretty poses, 
Waiting and shyly longing to be kissed. 
CHORUS: 
Softly, low and thrilling is the music of her voice, 
Listening to its melody makes my heart rejoice; 
Softly mellifluous, thrilling through and through us, 
Melodiously, magically sweet; 
Silvery voice replying, as she's softly sighing, 
In words so dear I 
must not e'er repeat. 
In the garden resting, the trailing vines investing, 
The scene reflected from the moonbeam's glow; 
With hues of rarer beauty, than nature in its duty, 
Did e'er before upon such scenes bestow; 
hair in tangles glinting, with the moonbeams tinting, 
O'er her shoulders in resplendent streams; 
So carelessly tis falling, and the night birds calling 
Wake us from those blissful lovesome dreams. 
(Chorus). 
I 
begged my sweetest darling to be my life-long darling, 
The night birds ceased their melody to list; 
Then with sweet voice thrilling, the air with music filling 
She consented in our lovely garden tryst; 
My heart was tilled with rapture, my sweet, delicious cap-
ture, 
Diffused throug,h brain and heart a 
sudden glow; 
With sweet, ecstatic feeling, before my angel kneeling-, 
I 
slipped a 
pledge upon her hand of snow. ( Chorus). 
CHEATING GIRLS AT TWILIGHT, 
-: 
0:-
By RUTH the Gleaner, for JEPPE and FANNIE DELANO. 
I've met my darling after dark, 
Her cheeks were red and white; 
She smiled, I 
blushed because. you see 
I 
was not sober quite; 
She said, oh, laws! what ails you, George? 
Said I, don't ask I 
pray; 
And as sure as I'm alive, 
She walked off the other way, 
Cnours: 
So cheating girls at twilight, 
Is not so very smashing; 
For when you're trying to fool them, 
They grow a 
heap more dashing. 
But don't you think that I 
was right, 
Oh, no, you bet, for I 
had 
Only had a 
glass or two 
Of•soda on the sly; 
Ah, well, I 
did not say a 
word, 
But what I'm going to tell— 
And these were simply, kiss me, dear. 
Said she, what's that I 
smell? 
The sequel of this story is, 
Like all such things you see; 
I 
tried to fool the girl, but found 
That she was fooling me; 
For one fine evening afterward, 
I 
met her on the street; 
She merely bowed, and whispered, low, 
You've missed it on the cheat.

CAN YOU SO SOON FORGET ME 
'Written by FDWIN TALBOT, Esq. Sung with great success by HARRY 
KENNEDY, at the SAN FRANCISCO M INSTREIS, Nem 
ork. 
Music to be had at Mrs. P. 
LIEDER'S Music House, SO Chatham Street, 
who holds the Copyright. 
Can you so soon forget me, 
You loved me once so well; 
You loved me in the Summertime, 
The Wintertime as well; 
You said you would never leave me, 
My love you would never forget; 
And often in our tales of love, 
I 
called you my dearest pet. 
CHORUS: 
In the evening when 'twas twilight, 
You've often sat beside me; 
Whispering love, my turtle dove, 
Can you so soon forget me; 
I'm fading like the flowers, 
That blushed and bloomed in Summer. 
Dear is the vision that merrily recalls, 
Can you forget me so soon? 
Then my heart shall feel no trouble, 
My head shall feel no pain; 
Only to see thee, darling, 
And hear thy voice again. 
Just to press thy ruby lips, 
Your sunny face I 
see; 
Don't forget me, darling, 
Can you so soon forget me?

WALKING OUT ON SUNDAY. 
Sung with great success by JEPPE it FLYNT DELA.NO. 
He. 
Walking out on Sunday I 
think very nice, 
What I 
would dispense with, not at any price, 
So when the weather's proper, I'm ready in a 
trice 
To take my usual walk upon a 
Sunday. 
A 
drive out in a 
trap, how some folks seem to prize, 
But the exercise of walking I 
would most advise; 
And, oh, such funny sights, and, oh, such horrid guys 
You meet with when you're walking out on Sunday. 
CHORUS. 
Walking out on Sunday, in the afternoon, 
Driving out on Sunday, in the afternoon, 
Crawling out on Sunday, in the afternoon, 
It's awful jolly walking out on Sunday. 
She. 
Now there's Augustus Tompkins, a 
very heavy swell, 
He manages to live somewhere on Murray Hill; 
You'd think he was a 
banker instead of a 
Broadway clerk, 
As he goes out to take his walk on Sunday. 
With his silver headed cane, and a 
glass stuck in one eye, 
He twirls his fine moustache, which suspicious looks of dye, 
In fact you seldom see so elegant a 
guy, 
As Tompkins when he's crawling out on Sunday. 
Walking out, etc. 
There's that pretty little shop girl, as she sweeps along, 
With the newest style of hat, from the Bowery, corner of Bond. 
In the distance you might take her for one of the Haut ton, 
As she goes sailing out upon a 
Sunday. 
She. 
Oh, there's that nobby Broadway clerk, in business he's so smart. 
Got up regardless of expense to captivate some heart, 
His garments are from Brooks' fashionable mart, 
So off he struts to meet his girl on Sunday. 
Walking out, etc.

And eyes that beam so bright, 
With happy face so sweet and fair, 
And heart so fond and light.

And says lie loves me true; 
Yet I 
can scarce believe his words, 
Tell me, I

CHORUS. 
I'm sure I

He says he loves me, too; 
Yet I 
can scarcely trust the spell, 
Tell me. I

HE. 
I

maid so bright and fair, 
And sweet as she can be; 
With roguish eye and sunny hair, 
Such as you seldom see. 
She's merry as the laughing brook, 
I 
think she loves me, true; 
Yet I 
can scarcely trust her look, 
Tell Me, I 
pray, would you? 
CHORUS. 
I 
know I 
love her more than all, 
And think she loves me, too; 
And soon to ask her I 
shall call, 
Tell me, I 
pray, would you ? 
SHE. 
I 
wish he'd call me to his side, 
And whisper words of love; 
And call me all his joy and pride, 
His darling turtle dove. 
But, then, he never will do so, 
Although I 
love him true; 
I've half a 
mind to let him go, 
Tell me, I 
pray, would you? 
I'm sure I 
love him, etc. 
HE. 
Come, tell me, sweetest little pet, 
You'll love no one but me. 
SHE. 
While life shall last, without regret, 
I 
give myself to thee. 
BOTH. 
And as we journeysm through, years, 
We ever shall be true; 
We'll neyer shed regretful tears, 
Tell me, I 
pray; would you ? 
CLIORIIS—BOTH. 
We're happy as two turtle doves, 
We love each other true; 
We'll ne'er regret the day we met, 
Tell me, I 
pray, would you?

Gent.-0, such a 
charming girl I 
met 
While out the other day, 
For a

Upon our great Broadway; 
She tripped along, and looked so neat. 
Withal so very shy; 
As at her sprightly form I 
gazed. 
T

It really was alarming (Symph.) 
The way my heart wen i

As she went tripping by. 
When I'saw this sweet creature, 
So fair in every feature, 
With an awful lump, like a 
camel's hump, 
I 
really thought I'd fly. 
Lady.--While walking out the other day. 
0, such a 
handsome man, 
I

By accident, my fan

It to me with a 
bow;

cant forget his handsome face, 
Would he were with me now. 
CHORUS:

It really was alarming 
The way my heart went bumpety bump 
When to me he did bow.. 
My peace is gone completely, 
Since he smiled on 'me so sweetly.

Would he were with me now.

James Gordon Bennett's Carpet Bag. 
Written and sung by America's Favorite Motto and Comic Vocalist, 
CHARLES H . 
DuNcAN. 
I'll sing you a 
ditty that I'm sure you'll say is witty, 
And before I'm done will cause you all to laugh. 
'Tis of a 
man of some renown, and a 
native of this town, 
Connected with art editorial staff. 
He went abroad, ' tis said, some damsel fair to wed, 
Whose Chris-ian name, ' tis whispered round, was Mag. 
When he sailed for Liverpool, across the briny pool, 
In his left hand he held a 
carpet bag. 
I 
know ' twill be a 
task, an unpleasant thing to ask 
Your ears, but pray don't let your spirits flag, 
And I'll endeavor to explain, yes, each article will name 
I 
saw within James Gordon Bennett's bag. 
There was reports of the Brooklyn scandal, and a 
symphony 
wrote by Handel; 
Letters from the only girl he ever loved; 
A. pair of Harry Miner's dirty socks, wrapped in a 
note from 
" 
Sunset " Cox; 
A package of " queer " that some young gounoff shoved; 
Elizabeth Ti!ton's la'st confession, an article on secession, 
While tied up in Dr. Mary Walker's old suspenders 
Was a document rather suspicious, looking old and quite 
j 
udicious, 
Containing accounts of Senator Conkling's secret benders; 
Then a 
poem by deacon Smith, without either rhyme or pith; 
A 
new-fangled way to play the game of tag; 
A 
picture of President Hayes lacing Victoria Woodhull's stays, 
I 
saw within lames Gordon Bennett's bag. 
There was the long lost Charlie Ross with Jack Aberle on a 
hoss, 
Making love to Tennie Claflin on the sly; 
Old Ben Butler on a 
stump Potter's committee trying to pump, 
Senator Thurman he was chanting " Root hog or die." 
Owney Geoghan he was caught doing things he hadn't ought, 
Billy Sexton with a 
broken billiard cue. 
He was stirring a 
pot of soup for a 
girl who had the croup, 
Who rejoices in the name of Dick- foot Sue; 
Muldoon the solid man he had joined a 
Scottish clan, 
Little Mack was holding Bonnet's bobtail nag; 
But what caused by brain to whirl was Pastor's Coney Island 
girl, 
Dancing the can-can in James Gordon Bennett's bag.

THE MODERN SWELL" OF ERIN. 
Written, Composed and Sung by H ARRY W HALING at 
TONY PASTOR'S THEATRE. 
Good evehing, boys, you don't know me, 
As you've not seen me before; 
I'm a 
gentleman you all can tell, 
From Erin's lovely shore; 
So if you will just list to me, 
I'll make you understand; 
A few things that some here don't know, 
Of my own dear native land. 
CHORUS: 
Then for wit, good nature, 
Where's the men to beat those from our sSoil? 
They're ever frisky, ever gay, 
And willing hard to toil; 
They'll shake a 
stranger by the hand, 
And greet him with a 
smile; 
These are the sort of men you'll find, 
If you visit Erin's Isle. 
I've heard you call us ragged Pat, 
And dirty Irish, too; 
But we can dress in pomp and style, 
Ah! just .as well as you; 
We've gained respect through all the world, 
And on every distant shore— 
They praise " O'Connell," " Goldsmith," 
And our late " Sir Thomas Moore." 
(Chorus). 
4,•,S
5'='s • 
There's bad and good in every clime, 
That each of us well know; 
But still, to class all men alike, 
'Tis wrong you should do so; 
Is there a 
flock that hasn't got 
A black sheep, tell me that? 
Then take my tip, you'll find worse friends 
Than those you call poor Pat. 
I 
hope that with my little song, 
I've offended none of you; 
But always bear this in your mind, 
As this world you travel through— 
That man is man, and who is more, 
No matter what he be; 
Pat is flesh and blood, as well as you, 
Then why not all agree? 
(Chorus). 
(Chorus).

HI COCKALORUM, JIG, JIG, JIG. 
As snug with great success by Miss enginol HUGHES. 
In Harlem it was once my fate to see four little boys, 
Who, trying to enjoy themselves, kicked up an awful noise; 
The game they played was one which I 
had never seen before, 
But what drew my attention was to hear these urchins rear. 
CHORUS. 
Hi Cockalorum, jig, jig, jig, 
Jig, j 
ig, jig, jig, jig, jig, 
Classical language, don't you twig, 
Hi Cockalorum, jig, jig, jig. 
Returning to my friends to dine, I 
being a 
good young maw, 
They asked me if I'd say the grace before the meal began, 
All eyes were closed, each head was bent, hands clasped in 
style devout, 
I 
meant to say it proper, but instead I 
blurted out. 
CHORUS.—Hi 
Cockalorum, &c. 
Now, after this, most strange to say, the phrase ran in rrAy 
head, 
And though I 
tried to banish it, it never, never fled; 
I 
took to drink, I 
tried the turf; balls, concerts, or the play, 
But no odds what the music was, to me it seemed to say. 
CHORUS.—Hi 
Cockalorum, &c. 
Each girl who used to think me nice, soon put me down s. 
bore, 
Instead of warm receptions, I 
was cooly shown the door, 
At every such rebuff, of course, I 
asked the reason why 
And each bewitching damsel said in accents sweetly shy. 
CHORUS.—Hi 
Cockalorum, &c.

The Day When You'll Forget Me.

As sung by JEN= Monolaa. 
Iret...sic to be had of OTATICB Duval; k Co., Boston, Mass., Pries oets 
You call me sweet and tender names, 
And softly smooth my tresses, 
And all the while my happy heart 
Beats time to your caresses. 
You love me in your tender way, 
I 
answer as you let me; 
But ah! there comes another day. 
The day when you'll forget me, 
The day when you'll forget me. 
I 
know that ev'ry fleeting hour 
Is marked by thoughts I 
bring you, 
I 
know there dwells a 
subtle pow'r 
In the sweet songs I 
sing you. 
I 
do not fear the darkest way, 
With those dear arms about me, 
Ah! no, I 
only dread the day 
When you can live without me, 
When you can live without me. 
And still you call me tender names, 
And softly smooth my tresses; 
And still my happy answ'ring heart 
Beats time to your caresses. 
Hush! let me put that touch away, 
And clasp your hands above me; 
So while I 
ask to die that day, 
The day you will not love me. 
The day you will not love ma. 
You need not check the thoughts that ris4! 
With darkness wrapt about them, 
For gazing in your earnest, eyes, 
My heart can almost doubt them. 
Yet bush my whispers as you may; 
Such chidings do not fret me;' 
no, I 
only fear that day, • 
The day when you'll forget me, 
The day via.* you'll forget wt; 
Love Him all the Same. 
Sung by EMMA ROGERS, in the sketch written for her by NED STSAIGOT, 
entitled: " Jealousy ; or, Two can Play at that Game." 
Where are all the words endearing 
That my darling used to say ? 
Where the tones that were so cheering ? 
Oh bring them back to me, I 
pray. 
They say that he is false to me, 
Has brought upon me deepest sharaw ; 
Yet bring him back where'er he be, 
For, oh, I 
love him all the same. 
CHORUS. 
Tho' the ocean rolls between us, 
Tho' upon his name's a 
stain, 
Tho' he languish in a 
prison, 
Still I 
love him all the same. 
When we parted in the arbor, 
Sweet to me the kiss he gave, 
As his ship sail'd from the harbor 
My heart was lonely as the grave. 
Three long and weary years have flea 
One letter only from him came, 
"I'm coming back to you," he said, 
And oh, I 
love him all the same.. 
res., 
sung by Miss ELOISE LiNnoN. 
I 
am a 
girl of style you see, 
And everywhere I 
go, 
Some fellows always follow me 
If I 
walk fast or slow. 
Perhaps they think my heart is true, 
Or I 
have lots of cash, 
Or its cardinal red or navy blue 
I 
wear with such a 
dash. 
CHORUS. (Waltz.) 
When I 
walk out at 3 
P. M., 
To take the bracing air, 
I'm sure to meet a 
score of men. 
Always at me stare. 
I 
hear them say, I 
wonder who 
That daisy there can be, 
In the cardinal red and navy blue, 
Whom we so often see. 
Some say that I'm a 
fashion plate, 
Cut from a 
magazine, 
Others, I'm a 
counterpart 
Of some young foreign queen. 
But then I 
never mind the cut, 
But go right straight ahead: 
In my cardinal red and navy blue, 
To which I'm really wed.

walk out, etc.

Fly across the ocean, birdie, 
Fly beyond that gloomy sea; 
There you'll find a

Who has pledged his life to me. 
Tell him how my heart was aching, 
Aching that I

That my pride will not allow him 
To recall those words again.

Do not tarry on the way;

Tell him, birdie, to remember, 
How my curls have nestled there. 
Let him call to mind the momenta, 
When our hearts were both so free,

For I 
fell in love with such a 
dove, 
Df my heart she is the queen. 
ks she sweetly smiled she set me wi:d, 
With love I 
shall go crazy; 
For I 
scarcely knew just what to do, 
Her smile was so serene, 
Like a

And before I 
knew it this darling she had won me; 
She's the fairest, she's the rarest, 
She's a 
little dove in clover over there.

With sweet laughing•eyes, like the sunrise, 
She looked so fair, bewitching, 
And the world to me now seems to be 
So full of laughing eyes. 
With this little pet I 
met 
In golden mild September, 
How my heareit beat, she looked so sweet, 
Oh, I 
never can forget; 
And so now you see, she's the world to me, 
Her loving smile enchains me, 
And her eyes of blue they pierce me through, 
I 
wish the time was set. 
She's a 
little dove in clover, 
But will her love be true? I 
often sit and wonder. 
She's a 
darling, she's a 
starling, 
She's a 
little dose in clover over there.

There's a

Her mother she peddles lemonade, her brother he slings hash, 
Vet the neighbors say most every day, Johanna's on the mash.

She's a

Has something that you all would desire,

OH! fancy brings a

Of flowers sweet and rare, 
With grace and beauty there combined, 
And brightest hues so fair— 
Sc, like a 
maiden that I 
loved— 
It was my happy lot: 
I 
whispered when we parted last— 
" 
Oh! you'll forget me not!"

Farewell. 
The last tie is severed that bound me to thee, 
The struggle is over, and now I 
am free; 
I 
have loved thee so fondly no language could tett 
So proudly and coldly I 
bid thee " Farewell." 
The conflict is over. I've conquered at last, 
No longer in sadness I 
muse on the past; 
To my joy I 
have conquered, the conflict is o'er, 
So proudly I 
tell thee I 
love thee " no more." 
You may go and be happy—ne'er think of the past, 
You have slighted a 
love that could love to the last; 
You may now pass me by with that cold smile of yore, 
But proudly I 
tell thee I 
love thee " no more." 
I 
bid thee forget me, wherever thou art, 
Though thoughts of my first love may cling to my her, 
When friends shall prove false, and fortune decline, 
Thou wilt sigh for the love that no longer is thine. 
W HEN you see a 
young couple late at night on the lake

Words and music by JAS. W. WHITE. Sung with great success 
by PErrir and WHITE in all the principal 
theatres in the United States, 
I 
fell in love with a 
saffron-colored girl, . 
And I 
think the day I'll rue— 
She's freckled, she squinted, and her hair is red, 
And her eyes are Paris blue. 
She's a 
little bald-headed, but that's no sin, 
She looks just like a 
crane— 
With mouth like a 
tunnel, and nose like a 
funnel, 
And I'll tell to you her name. 
CHORUS. 
Why, it's Fanny Lucia Lucinda, 
Fanny Lucinda that's her name. 
(Repeat chorus.) 
She's a 
darling, she's a 
daisy, I 
know she'll drive me crazy; 
She's as playful and as lively as a 
goat. 
Her feet are like a 
camel's, went six month's without water, 
And her breath is strong enough to pull a 
boat. 
'She's the champion high kicker, there's no one can lick her, 
She's a 
sort of a 
go- as-you-please. 
She's worth a 
million in her mind, her likes you'll never find, 
And you bet your life that she is just the cheese.

Then to we you'll returr...

Allow me to See you Home. 
Sung by EDWIN BARRY at the Theatre Comique, New Yoric. 
They say I'm a 
desperate flirt, 
A 
gay and a 
festive young man; 
I 
admit it and boldly assert 
I 
will have all the pleasure I 
can; 
I 
admire pretty faces and feet, 
And whenever chance leads me to roam, 
If a 
sweet pretty girl I 
should meet, 
I 
insist upon seeing her home. 
CHORUS. 
Allow me to see you home, 
That is if I 
don't intrude, 
No matter how far, so pretty you are, 
I 
hope you'll not think that I'm rude : 
Oh do let me see you home 
You sweet little scrumcious maid, 
You've nothing to fear you sweet little dear, 
Come along and don't be afraid. 
Sometimes the fair creatures say " yes l" 
And often decidedly " no ;" 
'Tis then 1 
endeavor to press, 
Until they allow me to go; 
Then I 
secretly wonder how far, 
Sometimes it's a 
duced long way, 
I 
then think what fools we men are I 
But still I 
continue to say 
Allow me to see you home, &c. 
One night I 
was had for a 
mark 
And felt just a 
little bit small, 
'Twas a 
girl that I 
met in the Park, 
A 
13,2autiful figure so tall; 
She allowed me to stand her champagne, 
*And pay for a 
cab to her door, 
Then advised me to run home again 
As she did'nt NI ant anything more. 
SPOKEN.—Pretty thing to tell a 
fellow after standing supper, 
paying cab fare eight and a 
half miles; told me to run home 
again; bounced in and shut the door in my face. 
I 
declared 
that should be the last girl I 
should see home, but I 
scarcely 
got twenty yards from the house when I 
met another fair 
creature. 
I 
said " Ahem, rather late to be alone, miss." 
No answer, so I 
raised my hat and said, " I 
beg pardon miss 
but— 
Allow me to see you home, &c.

It's a 
shame on the stage how they mimic our race, 
In a 
style that's a 
mystery to me. 
How the gentry in front will stand such insults, 
And receive such block-heads with glee. 
But if they went to old Ireland they'd make their mistake, 
For our boys in style are well dressed, 
And in manners as well to you I'll now tell, 
Sure they stand in this land with the best. 
CHORUS. 
For singing and dancing, and all kinds of fun, 
And if ever to old Ireland you wen*, 
From their head to their toes they wear stylish clothes-, 
I 
speak of a 
True Irish Gent. 
Some make up their face and look just like folbls, 
And walk like a 
dog with three legs ; 
But if they went to old Ireland to show them such fun, 
They would pelt them with stones and bad eggs. 
For it's there you'll find ladies and gentlemen, too, 
Educated, kind-hearted and true, 
And I 
hope that we'll see that little isle free, 
And the green with the red, white and blue.

To words of love, just like a

The streamlet unto thee sings songs of welcome, 
And happy moments we'll with love beguile.

I 
pray that love will hasten thee, beloved one, 
And bear thee swiftly, darling, unto me.

Kind friends just listen now to us, 
And we'll sing to you a

With spirits always gay.

VIOLET FROM MOTHER'S GRAVE. 
Words and Music by W ILL H. Fox. 
Sung by Wm. McALoos in all the principal Theatres in America, and 
Scenes of my childhood arise before my gaze, 
Bringing recollections of my childhood's happy days; 
When down in the meadow in childhood I 
would roam, 
But there's no one left to cheer now within my good 
old home; 
Father and Mother they have passed away, 
Sister and Brother are laid beneath the clay; 
But while life does remain, there's one thing I'll retain, 
A 
small Violet I 
plucked from Mother's Grave. 
CHORUS: 
Only a 
Violet I 
plucked when but a 
boy, 
And often when I'm sad at heart, this plant has 
give me joy; 
But while life does remain, in memorium I'll retain, 
That small violet I 
plucked from Mother's Grave. 
How well I 
remember my dear old Mother's smile, 
As she used to greet me when I 
returned from toil; 
Always knitting in the old arm chair, 
Father used to sit and read for all us children there; 
But now all is silent around the good old home, 
They all have left me in sorrow for to roam; 
While life does remain, there's one thing I'll retain, 
A 
small Violet I 
plucked from Mother's Grave.

TAILORS ON THE SPREE! 
Composed and Sung by M ARRY W HALING, Author, Comedian and 
Vocalist, at Ton* PASTOR'S THEATRE, Broadway, N. Y. 
I 
am a 
man of noble fame, 
Deny it no one can; 
I'm known throughout the whole, wide world, 
As the ninth part of a 
man; 
With needle and thread, and goose half red, 
I 
stitch and press all day; 
But when I've got some money, 
Then from work I 
slink away. 
CHORUS: 
Then as we're rolling in the street, 
Dead drunk and cannot see; 
Oh! Bobby! in thy mercy spare, 
Us Tailors on the spree. 
Each Saturday when we get paid, 
We to the public run; 
We Snips, we do the heavy, 
And drink whiskey just like fun; 
From morn till night we drink a.nd fight, 
To see us is a 
treat; 
At closing time, the landlord throws 
Us all into the street. 
On Sundays we all stay at home, 
The cause you all can guess; 
13eeause we never like to show 
The style in which we dress; 
When Monday comes, then out we turn. 
And to the Pop Shop steer, 
And shove some swell's clothes up the spout, 
That we may get some beer.

SPEAK TO MY WIPE. 
Bang by NED BARRY With great success at HARRIGAN & HART'S 
Theatre Comique, N. Y. 
There's a 
great and glorious time in store, 
For husbands one and all; 
For the wives are coming to the fore, 
And husbands singing small; 
The ladies mean to do the work, 
And so, in consequence; 
The men, all trouble mean to shirk, 
Oh! won't it be immense? 
SPOKEN.—And indeed, fellows ought to be grateful to 
the darlings for waking up to the fact, that the husbands, 
have maintained the wives Jong enough, and now they 
mean to have a 
turn themselves. 
By jove! 
Won't it be 
immense? When the fellow comes for the Poor Rates, 
Water Rates, or any other Rates, to say, " Ohl If its cash 
you require, you must" 
CHORUS: 
Speak to Lucinda! 
Yes! speak to my wife! 
Speak to Lucinda! 
The pride of my life; 
She saves me all trouble, all bother and strife, 
So I 
beg that you'll speak to my wife. 
They'll have to take us out each day, 
To Concert, Ball, or Rout; 
They'll have to treat us to the play, 
To Oysters, " Cham." or Stout; 
The dears will have to find the cash, 
To meet each big expense; 
They'll pay the debts or " go to smash," 
Oh! won't it be immense? 
SPOKEN.—Oh! bless them, they shall have Woman'J 
Rights, and Woman's Responsibilities, and we fellows will 
stay at home and look nice, and, I 
say, won't it be immense 
to order carte blanche from the wine-merchant and cigar.

settlement of " the little 
account," to gently remark—

SPEAK TO MY WIFE.— CONTINUED. 
They'll drive us down in a 
Four-in-Hand, 
To the Derby, darling pets; 
And find us seats upon the stand, 
And lay us losing bets; 
We'll have new costumes ev'ry day, 
Regardless of expense; 
And the tailors' bills they'll have to pay, 
Oh! won't it be immense? 
SPOKEN.—And when they particularly wish to take us 
anywhere, we will say, " Oh, No! really can't go; haven't 
a 
thing to wear." 
Then, perhaps, they'll remark, " But 
where's that sweet costume you wore yesterday?" 
And 
we will reply, " The idea, that thing! Why I've positively 
worn it twice." 
Oh! won't it be immense to have a

rig out from Poole for every possible occasion, with the 
definite understanding that he is to— 
To business they will go by train, 
Or on the 'bus will ride; 
And if it should come on to rain, 
They'll hare to go outside; 
A thousand things they'll have to do, 
To their disgust intense; 
And if it only does come true. 
Oh! won't it be immense? 
(Chorus). 
! 
but I 
fear it is too good ever to come off. 
Nothing would suit me better than to change places with 
my wife, she to take the care and anxiety of the " head of 
the family," and I 
to live a 
life of luxurious ease at her 
expense. 
Just imagilie, you know, if Chips, the Banker, 
wrote to say that there wasn't sufficient cash in hand to 
meet those little pieces of paper that are flying about with 
my autograph at the tail. 
Eh! I 
say! 
Won't it be im-
mense to write back and say, " Look here, old fellow, its 
not my affair at all. 
You must—

Sung by EDWIN BARRY. 
When forced to bid farewell to Loo, 
Pull away, my boys, pull away, 
I 
did not know what I 
should do, 
Pull away, pull away. 
I 
left her weeping on the quay, 
She said she would be true to me, 
As we sailed away to the Southern sea ; 
Pull away, my boys, pull away. 
CHORUS. 
For the wind must blow, and the ship must go, 
And loving souls must part, 
Fr the ship will tack, and the tar come back 
To the first love of his heart. 
(Repeat.) 
But then, if false should prove my fair, 
Pull away, my boys, pull away, 
I'd burn this little lock of hair, 
Pull away, pull away. 
If she be false and I 
be free, 
I'll sail again to the Southern sea, 
Where there are plenty as good as she, 
Pull away, my boys, pull away. 
For the wind must blow, &c.

My grandmother she at the age of eighty-three, 
One day in May was taken ill and died, 
And after she was dead, the will of course was read, 
By a 
lawyer as we all stood by his side, 
To my brother, it was found, she had left a 
hundred pound, 
The same unto my sister I 
do declare, 
But when it came to me, the lawyer said I 
see, 
She has left to you her " Old arm-chair." 
CHORUS. 
And how they titter'd, how they chaft'd, 
How my brother and sister laugh'd, 
When they heard the lawyer declare 
Granny had only left to me her old arm chair. 
I 
thought it hardly fair, still I 
said I 
did not care, 
And in the ev'ning took the chair away, 
The neighbors they me chaff'd, my brother at me laugh'd 
And said it would be useful John, some day. 
When you settle down in life find some girl to be your wife, 
You'll find it very bandy, I 
declare. 
On a 
cold and frosty night when the fire is burning bright, 
you can then sit in your old arm chair. 
And how they titter'd, & c. 
What my brother said came true for in a 
year or two, 
Strange to say I 
settled down in married life, 
I 
first the girl did court, and then the ring I 
bought, 
Took her to church and when she was my wife, 
The old girl and me, were as happy as could be, 
For when my work was over I 
declare, 
I 
ne'er abroad wo'uld roam but each night would stay at home 
And be seated in my old arm chair. 
And how they titter'd, & c. 
One night the chair fell down, when I 
pick'd it up I 
found 
The seat had fallen out upon the floor. 
And there to my surprise, I 
saw before my eyes, 
A 
lot of notes, two thousand pounds or more, 
When my brother heard of this, the fellow I 
confess, 
Went nearly mad with rage and tore his hair, 
But I 
only laugh'd at him, and said unto him, Jem, 
Don't you wish you had the old arm chair? 
And how they titter'd, &c.

Such a

Cupid's with their arrows loving hearts to meet, 
Lots of blots for kisses, and a

Meaning that my love is true to you.

She's just as sweet as honey, and she writes to me— 
You see that we are parted, she is far across the sea. 
If you've ever been in love, of course you'll understand 
The feelings of my heart, when loving letters reach your hand. 
How 
you'll stand and wonder what your sweetheart she has said, 
As I 
did, with the one that I 
have read. 
For on a

Of course I'm going to answer in a 
true love strain, 
And ask my little darling to return again, 
And soon a 
ship that's sailing o'er the dark blue sea, 
Will bring me such a 
letter, from my sweetheart it will be. 
Then when we are married, I 
will write you all the news, 
Tell you how WC 
get along, and never have the blues, 
What a 
little treasure wife I 
got from o'er the sea, 
Our letters then will spell L-O-V- E.

But the old man has come back again, 
Though years have intervened •

Poor old Hannah she did cry; 
Please, massa, don't you part us now, 
Or the old man he will die.

The old man ne is feeble now, 
And always has been true; 
Please massa don't you part us now, 
And we will both bless you. 
But massa sold the old man South, 
Far from his dear old home; 
And from me he was parted, 
And I 
was left alone; 
But he's come back to his home to die, 
The Lord his soul will save; 
And soon the old man will be laid, 
With me in the cold grave.

'Twas down close by the running brook, 
Where first I

The whippoorwills were singing, 
And the moon shone bright above; 
Her eyes were like the brilliant stars, 
As she watched the brooklet flow; 
My heart I 
lost that summer nig4t, 
Down where the daisies grow.

With love, my heart is dancing, (Break). 
In sweet dreams, yes, I'm prancing; (Break). 
She is fairer than the blooming roses, 
That wave when the breezes blow; 
Where first we met, Pli not forget, 
'Twas down where the daisies grow. 
We've often met down by the brook, 
Where first in love we fell; 
And as the wavelets washed the shore, 
Our tales of love would tell; 
I 
gathered<flowers and decked her hair, 
Where the laughing streamiets flow; 
And carved her name on the old oak tree, 
Down where the daisies grow.

One evening we were walking down, 
The green and shady lane: 
'Twas then and there I 
asked my love, 
If she would change her name; 
She blushed, and murmured, with a 
smile, 
I 
really can't say no; 
And now we dwell in happiness, 
Down where the daisies grow.

Motto songs of every kind, 
Have through the world been sung; 
But I 
have one, the truest one, 
You'll say so when I'm done; 
A 
tale of woe I 
will unfurl, 
A 
sad one you will own; 
You'll curse the day you saw the world, 
If you don't leave drink alone. 
Cnonus: 
Boys, leave drink alone, 
If happy you would live; 
Boys, leave drink alone, 
To you this good advice I

Once I 
was a 
happy man, 
And had a 
loving wife; 
She said I'll do what I 
e'er can, 
If you quit the drunkard's life; 
The kind words that she gave to me, 
I 
hurl back in her face; 
Now those once happy lives we lived, 
We now must live apace. 
This is a 
tale I 
know that's true, 
As in the world you live; 
And in these lines I'll prove to you, 
The story that I 
give; 
You seem in doubt, you won't be long, 
When I 
tell you, you will start; 
The tale that I 
told in this song, 
Is from this broken heart.

WHAT I'D ADVISE YOU TO DO. 
[55 
Written and Sung by MR. HARRY W HALING with great success at 
TONY PASTOR'S THEATRE. 
Some advice I 
will give you, if you will list to me, 
On the way to get on in this land; 
If you're wealthy don't sneer at a 
man when he's down, 
For we all on life's wheel have to stand; 
And as it moves round, none of us can tell, 
How soon we may stumble and fall; 
Then, when too late, to your sorrow you'll find, 
The weakest must go to the wall. 
Chorus—So ne'er be too selfish, nor yet be too proud, 
As this world you go travelling through; 
If your wealthy why stretch out your hand to 
a 
friend, 
That's what I'd advise you to do. 
There are men in this world who are well-off and great, 
And they have heaps of gold hoarded away; 
They ne'er are contented though riches their lot, 
But they crave on for more day by day; 
But when summoned away by the grim captain death, 
Or their tombs they grow feeble and old; 
Had they but their time to live over again, 
They freely would give up their gold. 
Chorus. 
Penny-wise and pound-foolish is a 
maxim you've heard, 
And I 
firmly believe it is true; 
For there lot's of young sparks get money in heaps, 
And with it don't,know what to do; 
They'll refuse a 
poor man who asked for a 
coin, 
His family from hunger to save; 
And spend all they have on debauchery and drink, 
Which quickly sends them to their grave. 
Chorus. 
Speak well of the bridge that carries you o'er, 
You may one day have to cross it again; 
If to day you're blessed with the rays of the sun, 
To- morrow may drown you in rain; 
If you're cosey and warm and not out in the storm, 
And you see a 
friend naked and bare; 
Oh ne'er let him pass by or at him look shy, 
Of your shelter pray give him a 
share.

THE MAID AND THE MAGPIE. 
Sang by NED BARRY with great success in H ARRIGAN &:" HART'S 
New Play, - Mulligan Guards' Nominee," 
Theatre Comique, N. Y. 
Now once there was a 
maid kept an old magpie, 
And a 
parson who prayed lived very close by; 
When this maid met the parson they both stopped to talk, 
And often on the quiet go for a 
cosy walk; 
But her lover was a 
sailor who sailed across the main, 
Xnd he promised she should be his wife when he returned 
again; 
Still she let this parson see her home from church. 
And kiss her, never thinking of the magpie on the 
CHORUS: 
The maid and the magpie would talk all the day, 
The maid would believe all the magpie would say; 
She said I 
love the parson, don't you tell the tar, 
When the old magpie only said " guar! guar!" 
Now, whilst this sailor was away, so the story goes, 
This maid flirts with the parson, but, of course, nobody 
knows; 
Until she tells the magpie when talking one day, 
She'd rather have the parson now the sailor was away; 
But she said don't tell this secret, or I'll give you the birch 
Every night at nine, I 
meet the parson near the church; 
The magpie only guar, quar'd as he had done before, 
But he meant to tell the sailor boy when he returned on 
shore. 
(Chorus). 
THE MAID AND THE MAGPIE.—CoNnNuED. 
Whilst stationed at Gibraltar, this sailor, so it seems, 
When. 
sleeping in his cosy bunk, he had some funny dreams; 
lie dreamt the girl he'd left behind on dear old England's 
shore, 
Would, whilst he was away, flirt with half a 
dozen more; 
So he made his passage homeward a's quickly as could be, 
Landed safely at her house, but no maiden could he see; 
lie then talked to the magpie who was dancing on the perch, 
And the magpie told him all about the parson at the church. 
(Chorus). 
Now when the sailor met the maiden, he passed her with 
disdain, 
So she sued for breach of promise, tried five hundred to 
obtain; 
But he brought the magpie into court, which told the 
truthful tale, 
So to get what she required, this maiden did fail; 
She then went for the parson, but in vain for him did 
search, 
For he knew which way the wind blew, so he hooked it 
from the church; 
The lawyers couldn't find him, so the case went on the 
shelf, 
And this tricky little maiden had to live by herself. 
CHORUS: 
The maid and the magpie ne'er talk all the day, 
For the jolly little sailor took the knowing bird away; 
And now with all hi 
Fi shipmates, this rare good hearted tar, 
While the magpie tells the truthful tale, he sings " guar! 
guar"

MeCORMICK'S MULE. 
Written by JAMES RICHMOND. 
Recited by PAT ROONEY With great success. 
McCormick had a 
Jack-ass, 
Blind in the teeth, lame in one eye; 
He had a 
celebrated record, 
For eating water and drinking pie; 
This Jack-ass was a 
high kicker, 
He won many an undisputed prize; 
He kicked out seven rows of Mrs. Murphy's teeth, 
And jabbed out both her eyes. 
McCormick's Mule 
This mule was born in Ireland, 
He wears the Shamrock on his nose; 
At the Centennial he stole an iron safe, 
And dressed himself in a 
suit of clothes; 
He broke into a 
Jewelry store, 
Stabbed the proprietor with a 
nail; 
Chased four Policeman into the river, 
And set fire to the Jail. 
McCormick's Mule. 
McCormick was arrested, and produced the mule, 
For him all the neighbors had a 
grudge; 
He slapped the Jury in the mouth with his tail, 
And kicked the neck-tie off the Judge; 
The mule escaped, and they held McCormick, 
For the doings of the mule he was tried; 
lie was just getting ten years' sentenee, 
When a 
telegram came the mule had died. 
McCormick's Mule. 
Moral on his Grave-Stone. 
Judge me as a 
Jack-ass, 
Or judge me as a 
fool; 
I 
was smarter than some politicians, 
That went to Grammar School: 
I 
had the brains of a 
mighty man, 
But for one I 
could not pass; 
So please have printed on my grave, 
McCormick's little Jack-ass.

king on earth is richer, 
For no gold your love can buy. 
Linger near me, little treasure, 
Let me look into your eyes, 
Where the sweetest violets blossom 
Underneath the summer skies. 
Put your hand in mine, my darling, 
And believe the words I 
speak ; 
Never any rose was fairer 
Than the roses on thy cheek. 
Linger near me, &c. 
Linger near me, little treasure, 
While the days are passing by, 
Meet me with a 
kiss at nightfall, 
And the love-light in your eye. 
Oh, my darling, life without you 
Would a 
dreary journey be, 
Let me keep you always near me, 
For you're all the world to me. 
Linger near me. & c,

Good-bye, Jakey, don't forsake me, 
Say to me that 
be true, 
We have murdered, robbed and plundered, 
I 
will die with -on. 
You promised me that you'd be true, 
No matter where we roam, 
It's hard to be condemned to die 
So far away from home. 
CHORUS. 
Good-bye, Jakey, don't forsake me, 
Say to me that you'll be true, 
We have murdered, robbed and plundered, 
I'll never part from you. 
Good-bye, Paddy, you're the laddy, 
You're the one led me astray, 
Now you see both you and me 
Are to be hung to-day. 
Oh, how I 
wish that I 
was home, 
Oh how sadly I 
feel, 
You will never die alone, 
Because I'll never squeaL 
Good-bye, Jakey, & c. 
Good-bye, mother, sister, brother, 
To this world we bid adieu, 
Do not know us, but disown us, 
We throw no shade on you. 
If we had done as you advised us, 
• 
From bad company staid away, 
Do not cry, we now must die, 
For us we hope you'll pray. 
Good-bye, Jakey. &c.

American Fortune-Telling Curds.—This is theiold. 
est and most widely known pack of Fortune-Telling Cards. We have 
published it for years, and the demand is continually increasing. 
These Cards are arranged and printed in series—Hearts, Clubs, Dia, 
monds and Spades—and each of these into K for King, Q for Queen, 
sad K 
for Knave, and numbers 1, 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
four rows, and are to be read according to directions. 
Many of the an-
swers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under‘ 
standing. 
Many professional Fortune-Tellers use these cards, and vrf 
are in receipt of letters in relation to them from all parts of the U. S.

Courting Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such P 
way as to be non-committat 
Many young ladies are visited by 
ntlemen who are either too diffi-
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon askingthe momentous 
question. 
The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unladylike encourage-
; 
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are syent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolongeu and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. 
This pack of Cards will overcome the dill'. 
ittlty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of th ei
r 
affecti
ons, 
which 
fact 
makes a 
further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties

IT PLEASES BOTH OLD AND YOUNG 
ft is a Fac simile of a Trick practiced by alt 
the Professors of Magic. 
It is arranged so systematically, and is accom-
panied with directions so plainly written, that, with 
a 
single perusal, any person may become an adept 
in an unfailing source of amusement. 
Bead what a leading Journal says of it: 
" 
An ingenious little book of the thaumaturgic ordel 
has been sent us, called IlumPrY DIIMPTY,' and bound 
in such a 
way as to give opportunity for a 
decidedly 
puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary appear 
ance of a 
child's picture-book, gayly printed and colored, 
it is so bound that a 
practiced manipulator, taking it 
up, and flirting the leaves rapidly over, can make it ap-
pear to be filled with copies of only one picture, or with 
blank pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of 
figures. 
One minute the pamphlet, quickly thumbed, 
appears to contain nothing but portraits of Harlequin, 
in his tesselated suit; the next, only Columbine; then, 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or Mephisto-
pheles. 
A little practice, and the directions printed 
with the book will make anybody at _ home in the hand-
ling of it."—Phila. Evening _Bulletin.
