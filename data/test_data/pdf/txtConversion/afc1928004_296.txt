BENNETT & KERNELL 
HARRY BENNETT was ushered into this mundane sphere 
,about the time that Adam learned to dance a 
straight jig. 
Being nearly twenty-one when he was born, he was seized 
with an irresistable desire to become an Actor ; and this 
longing having become almost a 
second nature with him, 
he succeeded, after many disappointments in affecting an 
engagement with Mr Edwin Booth, the great common 
ball tosser, to play the part of a 
battle-axe in Shakespeare's 
romantic tragedy of " Who Died First ?" 
After traveling 
through China with this company for nearly fifty years, 
and having become an intimate friend of Napoleon I., he 
was sentenced by that monarch to ten year's imprisonment 
for refusing to officiate as a 
cork for a 
Weis- bier bottle. 
While walking through the streets of Paris one day during 
his imprisonment, he met a 
giddy young girl, over whose 
4 
head the moons of one hundred summers had barely passed, 
and upon his propAsing marriage, she immediately con-
sented to become his husband. 
They were instantly 
joined in the sacred bends of hemlock, and lived six 
months on bread and whiskey—she ate the bread and he 
drank the whiskey. 
Having discovered, however, that his 
wife was indulging in an innocent flirtation with a 
dummy 
in a 
dry-goods store, he obtained a 
divorce, and taking 
his family with him, which consisted of a 
Newfoundland 
cat and a 
consumptive umbrella, he sailed for America, 
where he obtained a 
situation as a 
razor strap in a 
barber 
shop. 
The strapping of razors on his body, however, 
made him so sharp that he soon became popular again, 
and he was then engaged by Harry Hill to play the lead-
ing spear in the battle scene of " Dutch Justice." 
The 
adventures of Mr. Bennett, had we space to chronicle 
them, would more than fill this little volume. 
He has 
been drowned three times, and has taken a 
prominent part 
in several first-class boiler ex:plosions. 
He is now playing 
8 
5 
4 
the table in the kitchen scene of the " Quarrelsome Ser-
vants." 
His name is as familiar as a 
household word in 
a 
livery stable. 
Jons KEENELL was born with a 
wig and side-whiskers, 
on or about the year 1927. 
At the early age of three he left a 
wife and nine children, and started to seek his fortune as con-
ductor on the Erie Canal. 
At thirteen this young lady was 
unanimously elected barkeeper for a 
temperance society in 
Oshkosh. 
Having acquired the art of singine, and dancing 
on a 
xelocipede, he obtained an engagement to stay at 
home and take care of a 
sick door- mat. 
This, however, 
proving injurious to his constitution, he applied for a 
po-
sition as red fire-pan in a 
sewing society, and was engaged 
at the enormous salary of four thousand dollars per sec. 
ond. 
After playing three weekly seasons with this com-
pany, he formed an alliance with the Grand Union Junc-
tion of the Bung,town Branch of the Independent Organ 
Grinders' Mutual Relief and Benefit Association. 
While 
with this party, he SYS, 
twice arrested on suspicion of 
being sober, and only escaped imprisonment by ordering 
the Judge of the Court to pay a 
fine of two hundred and 
fifty dollars. 
The company hiving broken up, in conse• 
quence of the Treasurer running away with a 
valuable 
paper collar belonging to the manager , and seventeen cents 
in cash, he was obliged once more to appeal to Frank Lum 
for assistance, and that gentleman generously responded 
to the call by ordering him to be shot. 
He next formed a 
partnership with a 
mule, but that animal proving to be a 
worse kicker than Jim Flake, he split—the mule's head 
with an axe. 
While out of his head in the streets of New 
York, he met Mr. Harry Bennett, and they then agreed to 
become partners. 
They are now playing a 
successful en• 
gagement, 
in the Chicago tunnels, and their ability as bal. 
let dancers is evidenced by the fact that they are receiving 
three encores yearly.

success by BENNETT and KERNELL at the Olympic 
Theatre, Broadway, N. Y.

0 WHISPER while we tell to yeti 
A 
story that is short and thrue, 
The rayson why we had to go 
Across the raging water. 
The British army we did jine, 
They ' listed us for twelve years time, 
And thought they had us very flue, 
But we skipped across the water. 
CHORUS. 
Shug a 
roog, a 
roog, snug. 
Shug a 
roog a 
roo, 
Shugar in the lay-pot, 
How are you ? 
Away on the big ship we did go, 
Across the raging water. 
We liked the army well enough, 
But rations there were N'ery tough, 
They fed us on salt junk and dutl, 
And stirabout and water. 
They put us in a 
coat of red, 
With a 
waivin' plume upon our head— 
We often wished that we were dead, 
Or drownded in the water. 
Shug, a 
roog, a 
roog, shug, Ace. 
They made us swear to serve the Queen, 
They took from us our coat of green, 
They took our ould dudeens away, 
And threw them in the water. 
Then we resolved to take Frinch lave, 
For liberty we did surely grieve, 
The British guard we did desave, 
And skipped across the water. 
Shoog a 
roog, a 
roog, slug, Ace. 
And now we're in Amerikay, 
We do our ivoi-.z and get our pay, 
And many's the time we've blessed the day. 
We skipped across the water. 
The stars and stripes are o'er our head, 
The green does wave above the red, 
And British laws no more we dread, 
Since we're across the water. 
Shoog a 
roog, a 
roog, shug,

As sung by JOHNNY lisxxruz. 
I 
KNOW you'll have pity 
When you hear what I 
say— 
The way I 
have been treated 
By the blackguards each day, 
Who stand on the corners, 
As I 
pass them by, 
You can hear them say plainly, 
Arrah, " stag the old guy." 
Cuoaus. 
Oh, they yelt out, " You terrier, 
Go shoot that hat quick 1" 
They call me a 
chow and 
A 
flannel-mouth mick. 
The other day while a- walking 
I 
went down the street, 
A 
charming young damsel 
By chance I 
did meet. 
Says I, " You look charming, 
Ah, cushla ma vick ;" 
Says she, " Drop on yourself, 
You flannel-mouth mick." 
Oh, they yell out., ett, 
When election day comes, 
I 
know what they'll say— 
" 
How are you, Mr. McGuinness, 
flow are you to-day 7 
good day." 
They'll baud me a 
ticket, 
Say, " Go vote it, now quick—" 
I'm a 
gentleman then, 
And no flannel-month mick, 
Oh, they yell out, etc, 
Written by 'TARRY BENNETr. 
AS I 
sat in my easy chair last night, 
Watching the fire's flickering light, 
I 
thought, in a 
sort of half dreamy way, 
Of things that are happening every day. 
And soon I 
fell into a 
quiet doze, 
When before my e:, es a 
strange vision arose--
I 
thought that the great Centennial was here, 
And the people I 
saw were very queer; 
First Moody and Sankey appeared on the scene, 
With clogs on their feet, and suits of bright green; 
They danced a 
hornpipe, and tumbled about, 
'Till Moody gave up with a 
twinge of the gout, 
,ext, Ward Beecher in my dream took a 
part, 
And turned six somersaults over John Hart; 
Then President Grant went on the trapeze, 
rurned eighteen flip-flaps, and fell on his knees; 
Billy Coartv,,right rode on a 
half-starved nag, 
Giving out tracks from his old 
Flewy" bag. 
Brother . Therman stood, with a 
tearful eye. 
Imploring Moulton to treat to old rye. 
Bill Allen his old " 
rag baby" did bring, 
And with Vicky Woodhull he danced a 
fling; 
01l on one side was Butler the " spooney," 
Dancing t 
t-
el with little Pat Rooney. 
Kernell came In on a 
terrible spree, 
And told John Hart " not to give it a 
wee," 
Then Big Six came in— the once famous " Boss"— 
And sang a 
duet with young Charley Ross. • 
Sweet Susan Anthony stood on the floor, 
.And wit:i her jokes kept the house in a 
roar. 
Tony Pas or sang " Ta, ta Baby Dear," 
And Tennie C. Claflin walked in on her ear. 
The ghost of Tom Collins appeared in white, 
And went ' round the room looking for fight. 
John Raymond raw turnips gave to the band, 
While Scanlon and Cronin stood " Hand in Hand 
Sam Rickey was there, with " John Wild's Old Man ;'' 
Barry kept time with 1is " Alabazan." 
Allen was " Schneider" than ever before, 
And John Thompson was " On Hand" at the door. 
Harrigan and Hart dressed in " Blue and Gray," 
And evidently both had been " Led Astray." 
Sam Sanford was seated on a 
high throne, 
And played " Little Sw, etheart" on the jawbone. 
Dick Carroll danced till he quite lost his mind, 
And dared Gus Williams to " Pull Down the Blind." 
George Knight made love to Hengler's " Sweet Aleen," 
And Ad. Ryman tried to eat a 
whole scene. 
They kept up their frolic an hour or more, 
When, to my surprise, I 
heard a 
great roar. 
The floor gave way, and they all tumbled in, 
Filling the air with a 
terrible din. 
I 
jumped from my chair with a 
fearful scream, 
And found I'd had a 
Centennial Dream.

Written and sung by IIARav BENNETT, 
After eating pigs- feet late at night. 
THE other night, while feeling bright. 
I 
thought I'd have a 
racket ; 
The thought itseh was. 'good enough, 
But I'd no stamps to back it. 
I 
went to take a 
two-cent sail, 
To keep my spirits merry, 
But now 1 
wish that I 
had died 
Before I 
crossed the ferry. 
With lively boys and witching girls, 
I 
tell you it was merry; 
I 
never shall forget that night 
A-crossing on the ferry. 
I 
paid my fare and jumped aboard— 
The weather it was breez,-
 ; 
didn't care for wind or rain, 
For I 
am free and easy; 
And I 
began to think and think 
About Beecher and Frank Moulton, 
When all at once I

fearful :

With lively boys, tte. 
I 
felt a 
crash, and up I 
jumped, 
There was a 
fearful clatter; 
I 
looked about, and then went out 
To see what was the matter. 
A 
gal was yelling muriter, and 
She was a 
fearful screecher— 
I 
saw a 
man fall overboard, 
She said that it was Beecher. 
Chorus.— With lively boys, 
c. 
Then overboard I 
quickly jumped, 
To try and save the preacher, 
Because I 
though it would be great 
To rescue Henry Beecher; 
But when I 
struck the water, oh! 
You bet it set me screaming; 
I 
found that I 
had been asleep. 
And jumped overboard while dreaming. 
Chorus.— With lively boys, &c. 
Respectfully dedicated to 
Johnson and Bruno, by 
HARRY BENNETT. 
WE have traveled North and South, 
And again from East to West, 
We've sipped champagne in bright and naughty France, 
We have 
plowed the raging main," 
And we've been in sunny Spain, 
And with the senoritas had a 
dance, 
But there's nothing can compare 
With the pure and balmy air 
And beauty of America's free land; 
For to us it is most dear, 
And just while we're standing here, 
White folks, we're going to try to do the grand. 
CHORUS. 
Then keep your eyes upon us coons, ( Break ) 
We bounce around just like balloons; ( Break.) 
And, as we sli g 
our feet so high, 
You'll see that we're immense; 
We'd cause 3 
ou one and all to cry: 
They're nigs par excellence," 
oh, we love to sing and dance ; 
And, whene'er we get a 
chance. 
We pivot on the light fantastic toe; 
We are just as light as air, 
And we cause the boys to stare 
As through our evolutions we do go. 
And we captivate the girls. 
With their (lark and witching curls— 
With the fair sex us nigs are number one; 
And we're sure to make them smile, 
With our easy, graceful style---
Our dancing is to them a 
mint of fun.

SINCE JAMES WINT ON THE STAGE 
Written by HARRY BENNETr. 
As sung by HARRY KERNELL' 
MY name is John McSorley, in this city I 
reside, 
I 
reared a 
son to manhood, and he was my joy and pride; 
ut now play-actors and such trash do all his time engage. 
He's off his nut entirely since he wint upon the stage. 
CHORUS. 
He wears long shoes and stroked socks, 
And he says they're all the rage; 
My carpet's tore, and my house is in a 
roar, 
Since James wint on the stage. 
He throws his feet up high, because he thinks it is the style, 
He broke my chandelier last night, and filled my clothes with 
oil, 
He says he'll make a 
terrible hit, and tells me he's immense, 
And he took the ould woman's petticoat to play the nagur-
winch. 
He wears long shoes and stroked socks, &c. 
He has my hat and coat all spoiled, and everything is broke, 
His foot wint throu 1h 
the floor whin trying to dance the lively 
moke, 
He sings " Ta, ta," and ‘‘ Tra-la-la-le," just like a 
bird in a 
cage, 
And has me nearly crazy since be wint upon the stage. 
He wears long shoes and stroked .socks, &c. 
SITTING IN THE TWILIGHT. 
Words and Music by HARRY BENNETT. 
As sung by BILLY: 
WiLsoN. 
THE brightness of the day had scarcely vanished, 
The sun was slowly sinking from my view, 
When strolling in the stillness of the twilight, 
'Twas just by chance I 
saw my darling Lou, 
She sat upon the moss beside a 
brooklet, 
Her pretty dimpled cheeks were all aglow, 
When I 
broke the spell by whispering to her softly, 
Your thoughts, my darling I 
should like to know, 
Cuoitus. 
In the twilight she was sitting—[ Break.] 
Through the trees the birds were flitting—f 
Break.] 
Affection from her pretty eyes was beaming, 
Those charming orbs of heaven's deepest blue; 
And while my heart with happiness was teaming, 
I 
vowed I'd e'er be loving, kind and true. 
My heart was filled with joy when I 
espied her, 
For it was my intention to propose; 
I 
sat upon the mossy bank beside her, 
And in her hair I 
placed a 
blushing rose, 
She thanked me with a 
voice so low and mellow, 
My soul was thrilled with rapture by its tone; 
I 
thought myself a 
very lucky fellow, 
When she told me her heart was all my own. 
Chorus.--In the twilight, &c 
Written by HARRY BENNETT. 
As sung by HARRY KERNELL. 
I'VE a 
daughter who's surely gone crazy, 
It is a 
hard thing, I 
declare; 
She's now a 
theatrical lady, 
And wears a 
wig over her hair. 
She says " Wilt thou meet me by moonlight ? 
My heart's blood I 
would lose for thee !" 
She strikes attitudes in the kitchen, 
And kisses her fingers at me, 
CHORUS. 
In the day time she's Mary MeGinness, 
And employs all her time washing clothes, 
I3ut at night on the stage she's a 
countess, 
And they call her the " Lady Montrose," 
Shure, the wash- tub she calls it a 
castle, 
The soap is a 
dagger so keen, 
The coal- box she calls it a 
grotto--
Such goings on I've niver seen, 
She stabs herself with a 
potato, 
And says "' Tis for thee, love, I 
die !" 
On the ceiling she has a 
tomato, 
And calls it the moon in the sky. 
In the day time she's Mary McGiuniss, & e. 
She tells me she'll be a 
great actress, 
Admirers she'll have by the score, 
She'll be courted by dukes, kings and princes, 
And the divel knows how many more. 
She uses my hat for a 
casket, 
For jewels she fills it with coal ; 
For a 
carriage she has the clothes-basket„ 
And the clothes-pins are silver and gold. 
In the day-time she's Mary McGinniss, &c. 
FAR back in the sweet past my mem'ry's oft wandered, 
To the spot that I 
loved neath the oil shady trees; 
Where oft with my books o'er quaint stories I've pondered, 
Or to dream-land was wafted by mid- summer's breeze. 
I 
recall with a 
sigh the bright days of my childhood, 
When ' Death the old trees with my comrades I 
strayed, 
And heard the birds singing sweet songs in the wild-wood, 
Or watched the bright brook as it flowed throng the glade 
Caottus. 
But, ah! the bright days of my boyhood are fleeting, 
The faces of dear ones are passing away; 
It makes my heart sad when I 
think of our meeting 
'Neath the old shady trees, every bright summer day. 
Long years have gone by, and my comrades have left me, 
Their voices no longer are heard in the glade: 
But I 
see the old trees that I 
loved in my childhood, 
With their wide-spreading branches, and welcoming shade, 
As I 
pause by the brooklet, old mem'ry's steal o'er me, 
My heart it grows sad—the hot tears will not stay; 
For the many dear friends that I 
loved in my boy-hood, 
Are gone from my sight, and are passing away. 
Chorus.—But, oh!, &c. 
.iectfully dedicated to the AINSLEY'S, by BARRY BENNETT. 
NO doubt you've seen the ballet girls, 
Who dress so trim and neat, 
With pretty satin slippers on 
Their tiny, little feet; 
They float around like fairies in 
The ILht and airy dance; 
But we can please you better if 
You'll just give us a 
chance. 
Cnoacs. 
We are c 
illets from the West—U3reak1 
And our dancing is the best—[ Break ] 
We are very fond of music, and 
We love to sing and dance; 
In fact, we'll quite surprise you if 
You'll just give us a 
chance. 
Our daddy used to teach us how 
To shuffle with our feet; 
And when he played the banjo, why. 
The music was so sweet 
That we could not keep quiet, and 
That's how we learned to dance; 
And now we'll try to please you if 
You'll just pive us a 
chance. 
Chorus.— We are comets, ttc. 
That Girl in the Skipping Rope Dance, 
Respectfully dedicated to John Pendy, by HARRY BENNETT. 
FOR pleasure one evening I 
started, 
Just after my day's work was done; 
Fur sometimes I 
feel quite down hearted, 
And longed for a 
night of good fun. 
I 
visited s 
N
-eral places, 
I 
saw the great cancan from France, 
But my heart was charmed with the ',races 
Of a 
girl in a 
skipping rope dance. 
CHORUS. 
For bewitchingly charming and fair was she, 
As rouEd the stage she'd gayly prance; 
Oh ! she was the darling that pulverized me 
With her beautiful skipping-rope dance. 
I 
quickly obtained an acquaintance— 
Of course, took her out for a 
ride; 
I 
filled her with champagne an I 
oysters, 
And askoI lit r 
if she'd be my bride. 
Alas: that my lopes should be shattered 
It pierced my

Oh, George!

Georgie my darling, my love and my charmer! 
Oh, George!

I'd trust him with any youn girl, he'd_not harm her. 
When the swallows homeward fly, 
And the stars shine in te sky, 
'Twixt the sunset and the dark, 
Georgie meets me in the park. 
For Georgie darling now I 
sigh, 
With his lavender kids and his red neck-tie

01). George! 
beautiful George! 
With his light nut-brown hair and his eyes blue and tender, 
Oh, Georcre! 
beautiful George! 
With his pearl-color'd pants and embroidered suspenders : 
His llute-like voice so soft and low, 
Straightway to my soul cloth go. 
It's ecstasy to hear him say, 
" 
Who's your baby darling, pray ?" 
With his pouting lips, and his teeth of pearls 
And his dimpled chin, just like a 
girl's ! 
Chorus—Oh, George, & c. 
Oh, George! 
beautiful George! 
You are my darling, the one I 
love only. 
Oh. George! 
beautiful George! 
Away from our side I'm down-hearted and lonely. 
At. the masled ball the other night, 
Ge rgie was the girls' delight; 
The pride and envy of the ball, 
Georgie won the hearts of all. 
With his swan-like neck, and his soft white hands, 
And his melting glances, thus he stands. 
Chorus—Oh, George, 
Spoken after chorus to 3d verse—aeorgie was a 
remarkably 
pretty child, so his ma says. 
She used to dress his hair in 
long " silken curls" down his back. " Why, what a 
pretty 
girl!" strangers would remark. " That's not a 
girl," his ma 
would say, '• he's a 
boy !" " Indeed, and what's his name?" 
"Georgie"," she would reply; and then they would say Oh, 
pretty Georgie !" and that used to p:ease his ma so much. Shs 
says, " he's so handy around the house." 
Why he often puts 
on his ma's nice white apron and helps her make pies; and he 
can do " fancy needlework" just as well as any girl. 
His ma 
says he's too pretty for a 
boy, he ought to have been a 
girl. 
His Ina calls him " pretty Georgie." I 
call him "Georgie dear." 
We had a 
private theatrical entertainment up at our house 
the other evening. We played " The Lady of Lyons." I 
played 
" 
Claude." and Georgie played " Pauline," and he did look so 
sweet in his " lotto- white satin trail" and a " blushing rose" 
on his breast. 
He acted like a " queen." and looked every 
inch a " young bride:" and in the " Cottage Scene" he sighed 
and made love to the "Prince'' just like a •" real girl!" His ma 
called him " Georgiana" all the evening. 
And now, some-
times, when we have a 
little " love spat," I 
call him " Georgi 
ana," sometimes I 
call him " sister ;" but the dear boy doesn't 
get angry at it. 
He's such a " sweet fellow," he merely looks 
at me with those " languishing eyes" and playfully exclaims, 
"Oh! you giddy girl, if you s 
ty that again I 
shall strike you 
real hard " Which f 
rces me to exclaim, 
Oh, George! beautiful George! 
Georgie my darling, my love and my charmer ! 
Oh, Geirgel beautiful George! 
I'd trust him with any young girl, he'd not harm her

Sing of love, of love only sing.

They came in fr‘ona every direction, 
A....a they anr.g up their hats in the hall: 
It seemed filo a 
county election, 
Or a -.Mich 1
,,,,r;,et-company's ball. 
" 
Pat aaloney'" czme first with his family, 
And " The bs,d,7acres" marched in a 
platoon; 
-‘ Mc&vegan l'rom Mayo" drank whiskey 
With the great roelitician " Muldoon." 
" 
The Donavans" sat at the table, 
" 
Mrs. Hennessey" gave them her card, 
And " Malone, at the Back of the Bar," 
Served out drinks to tho • Mulligan Guard." 
Then some one called for a 
ditty, 
Which was sung by " Muldoon's Brother Pat ;" 
The words of the song were quite witty— 
'Twas about bleNanIn's Ould Hat" 
Sweet " Hilderbrandt Montrose" came in late, 
With " The Man with the Terrible Gaul ;" 
His toast was " The Day We Celebrate," 
And he drank the best health to them all. 
The " Mulcahey Twins" danced a 
fine reel, 
And 
Poor Uncle Pete bandied the bow; 
He played them a 
tune quite familiar, 
'Twas the air of " The Great Circus Show." 
But at last the wniskey o'ercame them, 
And tneir tongues grew as heavy as lean; 
The last man to speak was Mulcahey, 
Who said " Swim Out, You're Over Your Head.' 
!they slept 'till daylight in the morning, 
Then all went out hand in hand, 
stnil marched to their homes, quite contented, 
To the music of • Sneicier's Brass Band," 
Written expressly for JOHNSON & BRUNO, by H. BnINETT. 
Oh! dancing is a 
happy occupation, 
No matter whether dancing reels or jigs; 
But if you want to see a 
big sensation, 
Cast your optics on these Acrobatic Nigs; 
We learned our dancing down in Alabama, 
Where all de darkies sing and crack their jokes, 
But if you want to burst yourself with laughter, 
Watch de motion of dese Indian Rubber blokes. 
Cont. 
We're sure to make you think you are in Heaven 
For your troubles, boys, you will not care a 
fig ; 
Oh! watch us while we sling these number 'levens. 
We are double-breasted Acrobatic Nigs. 
Oh! the boys were always jealous of these clarkies, 
Because they couldn't sling themselves around ; 
Oh I 
we used to set de Piccaninnies crazy, 
Two others, like us, never could be found ; 
And often our old Massa used to wonder, 
And many times we've seen him shake his fist; 
For it used to make him just as mad as thunder, 
To watch us while we done our double-twist. 
We're sure to make you, R.

THE JOLLY OLD MAN, 
Written and sung by HArain. BENNETT. 
You see before you a 
jolly old man, 
My age is seveiaty-two; 
I 
ne'er let sorrow remain in my heart, 
And I 
never am sad or blue ; 
I've wrestled with fortune many a 
year— 
Of trouble I've had a 
good share ; 
But I 
smokes my pipe, and drinks ray 
For misfortune I 
do not care, 
Cnoars. 
Fol de lol, lol d3 lol, dum de dam day, 
I 
sing and dance all ray sorrows away; 
I 
like to be merry, jolly and gay— 
Fol de lol, lol de lol, dum de dam day. 
Fsome people meet all their troubles half way, 
And always are borrowing WO3; 
And that is the reason their hair turns gray, 
And their spirits do get so low. 
Now take my advice, give care a 
wide berth, 
Let your hearts be happy and light; 
For nothing is gained by crying, you know, 
So keep your eyes sparkling and bright. 
Caosts. 
Fol de lol, lol de lol, dum de dum day, 
I 
sing and dance all my sorrows away; 
I

But with my daughter Mary Ann I

Since Mary Ann learned how to dance, 
I

She's out all night ' till broad daylight, 
A

On every moonlight pic-nic sure my daughter can be found, 
And when I 
bid her stay at home she says, • Go feel around ;" 
And on starlight excursions, where the band ',lays Flewy-

'Tis there I'll find my Mary Ann a 
skipping the Tra-la-la-loo! 
Since Mary Ann, &c. 
Bad luck to moonlight pic-nics, they have ruined Mary Ann,

They insult decent people, and call themselves toughs,

And they say I

They always do give me their slang and abuse, 
They cry out .‘ Gilhooley, your collar is loose ;" 
At Mulligan s 
wake sure they filled me with snuff, 
And tould me to go out and get meself stuffed. 
Sure, one of thim said, if I 
wanted a

To go to the river and shovel off fog! 
But to understand thim I'm greatly at loss,

Then they threw me down stairs with a 
terrible toss, 
And tould the police they had found Charley Ross.

The N. Y. Evening :Vail writes: 
" 
A

We cannot say that we recommend 
it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, as we think it would only 
encourage the bad habit of " flirting." 
Unfortunately, there is enough 
of it done without any further necessity of explaining " haw, when and 
where to do it," and this little volume would advise and initiate the un-
corrupted in practicing what is commonly called "flirting." 
The N. 
Eeening Telegram writes: " We have lately seen a neat little 
book, bound in Morocco leather, costing twenty-five cents, called the 
"Little Flirt," published by A. J. Flanks, No. OS 
Nassau street. 
It 
gives information of the modus opt randi of flitting, and of the meaning 
of every motion of the handkerchief, fan, glove and parasol. 
As there 
is nothing at all objectionable in the volume, and its contents might af-
ford some innocent amusement to many, we do tot hesitate to recom-
mend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers."

Bumpty Dumpty.—The greatest Trick Book of the Age 
It pleases both old and young. 
It is the Fac-simile of a 
trick practised 
by all the Professors of Magic. 
It is arranged so systematically, and is 
accompanied with directions so plainly written that, with a single pe-
rusal, any person may become an adept in an unfailing source of 
amusement. Read what a 
leading Journal says of it : 
An ingenious little book of the thaumaturgic order, has been sent us, 
called 'H UMPTY Duairria' and bound in such a 
way as to give oppoitu-
nity for a 
decidedly puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary ap-
pearance ef a 
child's picture book, gaily printed and colored, it is so 
bound that a 
practised manipulator taking it up and flirting the leaves 
over, can make it appear to be filled only with one picture, or with blank 
pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of figures. 
One minute the 
pamphlet, quickly thumbed, appears to contain nothing but the portrait 
of Harlequin, in his tesselated suit ; the next only Columbine, then 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or Mephistophiles. A little 
practice, and the directions printed with the book will make anybody 
at home in the handling of it."— P1111. Eve. Bull

American Fortune-Telling Cards.—This is the old-
est and most widely known pack of Fortune-Telling Cards. We have 
published it for years, and the demand is continually increasing. 
These Cards are arringed and printed in series—Hearts, Clubs, Dia-
monds and Spades—and each or these into K for King. Q for Queen, 
and K 
for Knave, and numbers 1. 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
four rows, and are to be read according to directions. Many of the an-
swers depend upon the position certain carcla bear to other cards. The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under-
standing. 
Many professional Fortune- Tellers use these cards, and we 
are in receipt of letters in relation to them from all parts of the U. S.

Court ing Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want ft equently felt by young people—a want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too diffi. 
dent or too tearful of a 
iepulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. 
The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unlady-like encourage-
ment. 
As a 
result of this dilemma, many 
lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers. will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties
