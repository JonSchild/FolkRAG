Fred Militello, Jr.

The interview begins with Freddy Jr. providing biographical data to 
complete the Louisiana Folklife Survey Form.   
 
3:00 
He got started in shoe repair by working in the family business.  He 
started working for his father, Fred Militello, Sr., in 1985, after he 
finished high school and after he was married.  He wanted to carry on 
the family name and business.  He learned by working with his father and 
other employees at the shop.  It was “on-the-job-training.”  As he was 
growing up, he learned the basics by doing odd jobs around the shop, 
“taking heels off, or putting heels on…sewing a sandal, or doing 
something.”  He officially began working for his father in 1985. 
 
5:00 
His father opened the business in 1970, and he learned from his father 
(Freddy Jr.’s grandfather), who started working in shoe repair in the 
1950s, in Gonzales, Louisiana. When the grandfather passed away in 
1965, an uncle took over the business.  Fred Sr. opened his own shop in 
1970.  Freddy Jr.’s grandfather and uncle sold shoes as well as doing shoe 
repair.

The most interesting part of shoe repair for Freddy Jr. is “taking a pair of 
worn-out shoes and making them look like new.  And getting the rewards 
of the customer liking the job, bringing back  “life into the shoe.” The 
repair of each pair of shoes requires individual attention since “not every 
pair is the same.”  He strives to put it back together the same way it 
came apart.” He characterizes top quality work by making the shoe look 
“as original as possible.”  He tries to use original materials that are “top 
quality.”  The shop’s focus is on repairing the shoes that people want to 
wear, that they enjoy wearing often.  Their focus is not on fashion but on 
comfort. 
 
8:20 
He focuses a great deal of attention on orthopedic corrections.  For 
example, when a person’s foot pronates or supernates, he can put 
wedges in the shoes.  He alters a shoe’s height for “leg discrepancy.”  
Customers who need orthopedic corrections have a prescription from a 
podiatrist.  Rather than fabricating a new shoe from scratch, he alters an 
existing shoe.  Contemporary orthopedics result in a much nicer looking 
shoe that in the past.  Sometimes, for comfort, he might lower an 
original heel from, for example, a four-inch heel to a three-inch heel.  He 
can add fillers and pads to make shoes tighter; arch supports to raise 
arches; metatarsal pads to relieve pressure on the ball of the foot; heel 
pads to keep the heel from sliding.  To do his work properly, he must 
know a lot about the foot. 
 
11:14 
Freddy Jr. is a “Certified Orthopedic Shoe Technician.”  He studied at Ball 
State University in Indiana, 1987-88.  In the course he learned more 
about filling orthopedic prescriptions, making molds, and doing other 
orthotics. 
 
11:44 
When his father’s shop got a machine from Holland, Freddy Jr. was sent 
to Holland for two weeks.  During that period, he worked in seven 
different shoe repair stores to study Dutch shoe repair methods.  He also 
worked in the machine factory to learn how to repair the machines. 
 
12:33 
The economics of the business are getting more difficult, with the profit 
margin dropping.  Shoe repair prices have gone up only twenty percent, 
while other costs have “doubled and tripled.”  For that reason, he 
believes it’s necessary to be in an urban center where there is high 
volume.  He says, “Back thirty years ago, we could do twenty or thirty 
pair of soles a week, work boots, guys in plants wearing boots and all, 
today it’s not that. Today it’s more of fixing the small stuff,” such as 
buckles, straps, or glue jobs.

In the past, the majority of the work was repairing soles and heels. 
Freddy Jr. believes the trend has changed because the cost of shoes has 
gotten cheaper, while the cost of repair hasn’t.  People are “buying boots 
that cost $79, and it costs you $65 to change the soles. So a lot of them, 
they’ll go tear them up and then buy a new pair of boots. Now, the 
person that buys the $150-$500 pair of boots, will spend the $65 to fix 
them. But there’s so many of these box stores that sell the boots for the 
$49.95, to $79.95 type, so they’re just not worth repairing. Now, they 
will replace heels, on some of them, some of them they’re not 
replaceable. And that’s hurting us as well.” 
 
 
PART 2

An additional factor hurting the industry is that manufacturers are 
making soles and heels that are molded plastic, and these aren’t 
repairable.  Freddy Jr. also observes that the standard of professional 
dress have become more informal, so that people who once wore 
leather shoes might now wear “tennis shoes” or “flip-flops.” In “big 
metropolitan areas” the standard of dress is more formal, but “when 
you’re here in the South, it’s a little bit more casual.  So in the casual 
atmosphere, it reflects all the way down to us.”  Baton Rouge is the 
capital city of Louisiana, so professional dress is perhaps more required 
among professionals, but Freddy Jr. says that “the numbers have 
dropped.” 
 
3:05 
Freddy Jr. speculates that about 65% of his clientele are women, who 
need repairs on heels, or buckles, straps; glue jobs; or proper fittings. He 
might, for example, adapt the shoe to a woman’s foot: “This lady will 
have a skinny heel, with a wide forefoot, so then you have to adapt the 
shoe to fit that.”  He is in the store “90% of the time.”  He believes that 
the doctors in town send patients to him because they know that he 
takes “a little extra pride” in taking a shoe apart, putting in a buildup, 
and putting the original sole back on.  As for the future of his business, 
he believes that it has “another ten years.”  After that, shoe repair 
people will not be able to make a living. 
 
4:54 
The decrease in materials reflects the decline in the industry.  In the past, 
there were 120 shoe dyes; today there are 60.  The manufacturers of 
these supplies are also in a downward trend.  Militello’s has close is full-
dye department because of the decrease in demand.  People don’t dye 
shoes to match clothes so much, and the materials don’t allow for shoe 
dying.

Militello’s has had several different stores in its history.  Freddy Sr. 
opened his first store in “69 or 70,” while he also worked part time at a 
plant.  The first store was in the Clover Leaf Shopping Center at Airline 
Highway and Plank Road in Baton Rouge.  Then Freddy Sr. opened a store 
on Highland Road, which lasted one year.  He then opened a store in D.H 
Holmes in the Bon Marche Shopping Center in downtown BR.  They 
opened the store on Sherwood Forest (the location of the interview) in 
1984.  It was the fourth store.  They then opened in Hammond Air Plaza 
on Airline Highway, then on College Drive, then on Corporate Boulevard.   
They had a shop in “the old Tick Tock store on Government and Acadian” 
which they kept for about ten years.  They were in Cortana Mall for 
about ten years.  They even tried opening two stores in New Orleans. At 
one point, there were seven stores open at one time. Now it is down to 
two.  In 2005, Freddy Jr. bought the Sherwood Forest store, and his 
father owns the Corporate Boulevard shop.  
 
9:33 
In the 1980s in New Orleans, there was a mall store in Lake Forest, and 
one on the corner of Carondolet and Baron Streets.  These stores last 
about 5 years.  Freddy Jr. commuted from Baton Rouge to New Orleans 
each day, and the commute became too difficult. In the mid-90s, 
women’s fashion went from spiked heels to flats, and that cut their 
business in half.  Spiked heels require frequent repair.  Now a person can 
wear a shoe for about two years before it needs repair. 
 
12:24 
One difference between New Orleans and Baton Rouge stores was that 
New Orleans had a stronger walking culture.  On sunny days, the shop 
would do really well; on rainy days, there was little business.  They also 
had a more difficult time getting employees in New Orleans.  The nature 
of the business is on-the-job training, so an employee must be willing to 
invest time.  There are no schools.  There is some training in prisons, but 
the workers learn limited skills, which require retraining on the job.

The tools required for shoe repair are, first, machines.  Today, the 
machines are made in Holland, and it costs anywhere from $20,000 to 
$60,000.  A shop also requires a stitching machine, which hasn’t changed 
in design for decades.  An outsole stitcher and an insole stitcher are 
required.  There are also patching machines to repair holes.  Hand tools 
are also required, such as needles, knives, hammers, pullers, clamps, 
drills, and plyers. A hand knife is used to cut off an old sole, for example. 
Freddy Jr. uses both machines and hand tools. 
 
2:47 
Hand tools are used for cutting soles, pulling nails, hammering nails, 
pressing soles, and gluing soles. He also uses hand tools for luggage 
repair where he changes wheels, zippers, and handles.  A sewing 
machine is used for sewing straps.

A new employee might first learn to polish a shoe correctly, by cleaning, 
conditioning, and then polishing.  For shining, one starts with a brush 
applicator and follows with a rag for high gloss.  Freddy Jr. has done all 
the stages of shoe repair, including polishing. 
 
5:53 
After learning how to correctly polish, a new employee will pursue skills 
that he or she is comfortable with: “Whenever you’re working with a 
person, you can tell if they have any skills, hand-eye coordination, and a 
lot of times you let them start taking the shoe apart. They have to learn 
how to take it apart to be able to put it back together. So it’s kind of hard 
for one person to take the shoe apart and then give it to someone else to 
put it back together.”  Easier jobs include pulling a heel off or putting a 
new heel on.  More difficult jobs include taking a shoe apart and putting 
it “back 100% like we took it apart.” 
 
7:14 
The value of the work for Freddy Jr. rests in customer satisfaction: 
“When you hand a shoe off the counter to the person, you want it to 
look new.  You want them to be wowed.”  The work, itself, is also 
satisfying.  He finds the shoe repair much more satisfying than the 
business end of running the shop. He has had ups and downs with 
customers, as expected. 
 
10:34 
Freddy Jr. is known for a story about “the shoe, which occurred about 15 
years ago: “What happened was, I was contacted by the Baton Rouge 
Zoo. They said that they had an elephant that had a foot problem. It had 
a sore on the foot that was not healing. So they would scrape the wound, 
they would pack it with medicine, then the elephant would walk out into 
the mud and water every day, and it would open back up and stay 
infected. They sent me a paper with some different ideas of some people 
throughout the country that had the same problem, where they would 
take a car tire or something to incorporate a sack around the foot so it 
would stay. Well, by me having the knowledge to make shoes, I took it a 
little farther. I went to the zoo and I cast the elephant’s foot. And by 
casting the foot—this is actually his foot. . . . [connect to photo] What I 
did was I cast the foot, and made this mold.  I took the negative part and 
then made the positive. Then after the positive, I made a canvas 
wrapping, then I took it to Rhino-liner. And I had them Rhino-line the 
bottom of it.” Rhino-lining is the heavy duty, hard rubber used to line 
pick-up trucks.  Freddy Jr. added the laces, which the elephant learned to 
untie.  The boot material is canvas, with a Rhino-liner sole of hard 
rubber.  The inside is vinyl.  The elephant wore the shoe for 6-8 weeks, 
after which time his foot healed.  This story is “the most unique 
problem” he’s encountered.

He recalls adjusting a shoe for a young girl who wanted to go to Disney 
World, but had to be 48 inches tall to be able to ride the rides. The girl 
was 47 ½ inches tall, so he put a half-inch build on her shoes for her to be 
able to ride the rides, saying “What do you do?  You do it.”  He 
appreciates knowing a story behind his repair.

I ask him to describe the process of replacing a heel from start to finish.  
He says, “There are twenty different applications of heels. Ladies’ heels, 
men’s heels, big shoes, small shoes, I got different ones. But basically, 
you have to pop the heel off, and then you have to level the base, or 
whatever the surface is that the new heel has to go on. You have to 
make sure that it’s flat and square and fits right on the shelf, because the 
person has worn that shoe, and they’ve always wore that heel off to the 
side. And when it does that, it takes the shoe out of shape. So correctly, 
you take the whole heel off, you make the whole thing flat again, 
whether you build it up, sand it down, whatever it takes. Then, whatever 
type heel that was, you go back in with the same type heel, to put back 
on. Then the shoe needs to fit level when it sits on the counter or on 
their foot, where they walk. You can take a shoe apart, what some repair 
stores do, is they’ll put a new heel on. Then after you get through, the 
shoe doesn’t sit right, so if it doesn’t sit right, it won’t feel right on the 
customer’s foot.”  
 
3:15 
To build up the area, he uses leather, rubber, “or whatever the shoe 
requires.” He uses the materials that were original to the shoe.  He tells 
his customers, “If your shoe doesn’t fit as good or better after I fix it, 
something’s wrong, bring it back.”  Sometimes he has to make the shoe a 
little less than perfect to accommodate the walking style of an adult.  
Children can adapt, but “you really can’t correct a grown person.” 
 
4:57 
He is aware of the many “foot problems throughout the whole country.”  
He believes that most of the problems are “due to the erratic-type fitting 
shoes, shoes that don’t fit right.”  He takes pride in adjusting a shoe to fit 
correctly so that a person who “walks in with a cane, walks out holding 
the cane in his hands.” 
 
6:21 
He will go beyond a podiatrist’s prescription only if the prescription 
allows him to do so.  For example, if a doctor prescribes an arch support 
that doesn’t fit the customer comfortably, he will work with that 
support, moving it around a bit, in order to make it more comfortable. 
It’s a matter of “fine-tuning.” 
 
7:21 
He has built shoes from scratch in the past.  He tells a story about a 
cafeteria worker with a club foot that had been operated on several 
times. She was elderly and was working in a military-style boot which 
would last three to four weeks. He molded a cast to fit her foot and 
made her a pair of boots, and she wore them for four years until she 
died.  He occasionally had to repair the sole, but she wore them every 
day: “She’d wear them to church, she’d wear them out in the garden, 
and she’d wear them to work. She was kin to my wife, so I knew a little 
bit more of her than that. But that was a pair of boots that I made.” He is 
not set up to make shoes.  He says he would have to have a lab and 
would have to be able to do multiple styles.  “It’s just not worth it,” for 
him or the customer.

Mr. Militello engages in a real “service industry” with his customers.  He 
must engage with a person and know the personal problems with a foot 
and/or shoe.  He doesn’t use a lot of “technology,” saying “There are no 
computers that can fix a shoe because every one of them is different.” 
 
11:17 
He would encourage someone to learn the business at this time, but “it 
depends on what level you want to take it to.  If you want to work in 
here every day, morning to night and you do all the work yourself, you’re 
going to make a decent living. You’ll never get rich in this type of 
business. I think we’ll always have a job.”   
 
12:23 
At the moment, he counts on the luggage business, which he does 
himself, to offset the drop in shoe repair. To repair the luggage, he finds 
parts to replace straps or handle clasps. He repairs zippers in luggage. He 
also repairs wallets and key chains. He replaces zippers in jackets.  He 
repairs women’s purses. 
 
PART 5 
 
FRED MILITELLO JR. 
0:03 
To repair a whole in a jacket, he’ll cut a section out, find a piece of 
leather, and sew a seam to appear unobtrusive.  For shoe soles, he 
orders the name-brand sole to match the original sole.  Sometimes it’s 
glued on, and other times it’s nailed on.  Basically, he does whatever he 
can to keep his business running. 
 
2:12 
The interview concludes.
