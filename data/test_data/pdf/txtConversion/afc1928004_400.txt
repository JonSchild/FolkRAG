Chop the Sauer Kraut, Jake. 
AIR: " Rock the Cradle, John." Words hy D ICK GORMAN, and sung 
by him with great success in all the leading theatres 
of England and America. 
Kind friends, if you will listen to me, I'll sing for you a 
song 
About a 
little Deitche gal that loves me very strong ; 
Her age it was about three feet, she lives just five miles out ; 
Her fader he sells lager beer, and she makes saner kraut. 
SPOKEN—Yes, I 
went to see her the other afternoon, the 
day before last night, and as soon as I 
got in the house she 
jumped up and went out in the garden, and got a 
large head 
of cabbage. 
She then got two knives, and gave me one. 
Turning round she said, " Why don't you go ahead ?" and I 
asked her what I 
would do, and she said, Why, all you have 
got to do is to help me— 
CHORUS. 
Chop the sauer kraut, Jake, chop the sauer kraut, Jake ; 
And then she hit me by my head whenever I 
make a 
mistake. 
Chop the sauer kraut, Jake, chop the sauer kraut, Jake ; 
I'm afraid she'll kill me dead some day, and say ' twas all a 
mistake. 
One day while I 
was at her house the old man he came there, 
He beat me till I 
was black and blue, then broke my nose 
with a 
chair. 
Louisa cried, and so did I, when he told me to go out. 
He said that I 
might still there remain if I'd .help make more 
sauer kraut. 
SPOKEN—Yes, that was all the old man said to me— 
Chop the saner kraut, & c. 
I
But now I 
was so happy with Louisa for my wife ; 
We have got a 
little baby,who was the comfort of her life. 
You ought to see him hop around each day when he does play, 
He tries to tell us what he wants, but this is all he says— 
Original Song by GORMAN and ROMER, the German Emigrants. 
Just fitty years ago to-day 
Since you became my wife, 
And yet it seems but yesterday, 
So bright has been our life. 
Hard working we have always been 
Und now, in our old age, 
We're going home to Faderland, 
Dot's where we'll end our days. 
CHORUS. 
This is our Golden Wedding day, 
A 
bright time for our life, 
Und it is just fifty years ago 
Since you became my wife. 
Together through life we have gone, 
Und we have kept side by side ; 
It don't seem fifty years ago 
Since you became my wife. 
A 
family, too, of boys and girls, 
z-io good and true we've raised— 
Und now were going to Faderland, 
Dot's where we'll end our days. 
This is our Golden, & e, 
Uncle Zeke. 
Written by M. H. FOLEY, and sung by FOLEY and SHEFFER. 
When you left the old plantation, old man, 
I 
didn't know where you went; 
I 
thought you had joined the soldiers, 
And the Lord knows how I 
felt. 
I 
couldn't sleep a 
bit at night, 
My heart was filled with pain ; 
And, Uncle Zeke, I 
never thought 
That I'd see you again. 
CHORUS. 
I 
feel so loose and careless 
That my heart is filled with joy, 
Let us do a 
step for the white folks here 
Before we say good-bye. 
Oh, now that I 
am home again 
And see my friends once more, 
Things have changed a 
heap, my boy, 
Since I've been here before. 
I've traveled this wide world over and over, 
And many sights I've seen, 
But I 
love the old plantation 
Better than any place I've seen. 
CHORUS. 
I 
feel so loose and careless, Szc. 
Now that you are home once more, 
You're never gwine to leave the old Kentucky shore, 
But stay with me and the little ones at home, 
'And sing and dance for us once more,

The Girl with a 
Wart on Her Nose. 
AIR: " 
Octoroon: . Written for PETE BAKER (
of BAKER & FARRON .
), 
and sung with great success by DICK GORMAN. 
About twelve o'clock this evening, while down by a 
beer 
saloon, 
I 
met a 
little Deitcher gal what looked at me so soon ; 
Her clothes were of the latest style, her shoes they were quite 
new, 
She looked at me, I 
winked at her—I 
couldn't help it, now, 
could you ? 
But then my heart it went flip- flap, when I 
heard her say 
good-bye, 
She threw a 
kiss across the street, saying " How low was that 
for high ?" 
My heart it came of my mouth, I 
was in love you may sup-
pose, 
I 
looked again and saw she had a 
red wart on her nose. 
As she passed by I 
smiled at her, while the gang they done 
the same, 
For she was very pretty, though she walked a 
little lame. 
her toes they out her shoes, her hair it was quite red, 
\Then one of them roosters hollered out, " Go quick and soak 
her head." 
It was then I 
got excited, whan I 
told them to look out, 
When three or four or five or six quick hit me of my mouth; 
I 
fell me in the sewer, where the water quick there flows, 
That's what I 
got for looking at that girl with a 
wart on her 
nose. 
The Alderman. 
Written and sung with great success by Mr, RICHARD GORMAN. 
I 
am a 
true born Irishman, and I 
never will deny that same; 
Sure I 
took a 
notion for to cross the ocean—to America I 
came; 
When I 
landed here, it was in the year of 1862, 
And I 
was willing to fight, both day and night, 
For the red, white, and the blue. 
CHORUS. 
Then I'm your candidate for Alderman, 
So believe me what I 
say, 
Lay off your coats and cast your votes 
For me on election day. 
When I 
first mixed in politics my friends were very few, 
I 
never shall forget, every one that I 
met 
Said that I 
was too bran new. 
I 
worked the pipes on the Boulevard along with Micky Hart, 
Who was foreman of the old Sixth Ward and the owner of a 
big dirt cart. 
CHORUS. 
Then I'm your candidate for Alderman, 
So believe me what I 
say, 
Lay off your coats and cast your votes 
For me on election day.

The heart in my bosom has lately been stole, 
By a 
sweet blushing maiden, just nineteen years old; 
She's half Irish, blonde, and likes pork and beans, 
Her feet are a 
feature— she wears seventeens. 
Her front name is Hanner, 
Her father's a 
tanner, 
Him she does hammer, 
In an artistic manner; 
She sings " Star-Spangled Banner," 
And " A Lean Banana," 
With a 
tooth-brush I 
fan her, 
When she thumps the planner. 
She wears a 
Moire Antique pull- back, cost six cents a 
yard, 
Her hat and parasol are made out of lard; 
She shall be 
lady, like Judy O'Grady, 
For I've wealt:i (to get) and will keep it shady. 
Her front name, etc. 
Her mouth—well, it stretches from ear to ear, 
Whenever it's open I'm afraid to go near; 
Whenever she talks I'm never around, 
For I'm sure I'd fall in, and I 
know I'd get drowned. 
Her front name, etc.

FROM our home the loved are going 
Out upon life's stormy sea, 
And our hearts are sad in knowing - 
We shall ever parted be; 
They are seeking other pleasures 
Far across the ocean's foam, 
Finding other hearts and treasures. 
Loved ones going from our home. 
CHORCS. 
From our hatne the loved are going 
One by one like leaves that fall; 
Ever going, softly going, 
Far away from our recall. 
From our home the loved are going, 
Leaving us alone to sigh, 
And our eyes are dimmed with weeping, 
As we bid them all good-bye; 
Laughing eyes and sunny faces 
From us evermore depart— 
Loving lips and warm embraces— 
How we miss them from our heart. 
From our home the loved, etc.

When telling that same ancient story, 
That's new since the days of the ark, 
That soul thrilling moment of pleasure, 
That gleam of love's light tbro' the dark; 
Our hopes and our fears are all waiting, 
One word from a 
fair maiden's lip, 
If " no" all the world is a 
desert, 
If " yes" life's best nectar we sip. 
CHORUS. 
Our hopes and our fears are all waiting, 
On" word from a 
fair maiden's lip, 
If " no ' all the world is a 
desert, 
If " yes" life's best nectar we sip. 
A 
blessing, just then, is a 
baby, 
Who comes as if sent from above, 
• 
To say to our sweetheart that really, 
"What we call 'espect, he calls love ;" 
And when the sweet damsel surrenders, 
Excuse for most exquisite bliss, 
The quiet remark of the young one, 
"Whoever I 
love, why, I 
kiss." 
(
"Ah! Chorus)
babies, though mar- plots, you're jewels," 
If one has the talent to take 
The proper amount of advantage, 
Of all the queer blunders you make ; 
And many a 
lover has reason, 
To bless for the whole of his life, 
The infant whose timely intrusion, 
Compelled him to 
for his wife.

But she could valk as lightly as any person here; 
To tell you all aboud her, I

SPOKEN.—I'll never forget ven I

took de size of her finger

vent down to de 
jeweller, I 
said, " Make me a

He said, " Bring de keg down here, und let me fit it

SONG AND DANCE. 
1 
HAVE sung about the yaller gal, 
And she's lovely as a 
rose, 
But now I'll sing a 
strain of one, 
Indeed, you can't suppose. 
Her form is like Adonis fair. 
And her cheeks blush like the flowers, 
But the only girl that holds my heart 
Is little Fannie Powers. 
CHORUS. 
It was early in the Fall I 
met her at a 
ball, 
And she wore a 
wreath of coral flowers, 
As by her side I 
sat my heart went pit-a-pat 
As I 
gazed on my little Fannie Powers. 
I 
asked her then to dance with me, 
If she felt so inclined, 
She gave a 
smile and a 
look 
And answered, I 
don't mind, 
We danced the polka o'er and o'er, 
And passed the merry hours, 
I 
found that night my heart had flown, 
To little Fannie Powers. 
It was early, 
c. 
I 
Could not work, I 
could not sleep, 
For my heart was full of strife, 
I 
went to her and asked her plain, 
To become my darling wife 
She hung her head and blushed so deep, 
And her answer—you may guess, 
She gave a 
sigh, and then a 
look, 
And faintly answered yes.

THE HERALD COMPLAINT BOOK. 
A new idea for a 
song, taken from the column in tho V F. 
Herald, called the "Complaint Book," written by TONY 
PASTOR, and sung by PRANK LEWIS. 
The hit 
of the season at the Academy 
of 
Music, 
Pittsburg,. 
Of course in search of novelties are people now-a- days, 
New subjects they are sure to find in novels, songs and plays: 
But if in search of something new, you only have to look 
And read the various grumbles in the Herald "Complaint 
Book." 
POKEY.—THiS is from a 
gentleman who takes his meals out— 
Mr. Editor, in the restaurant where I 
make my daily calls, 
I 
fonnd an India rubber shoe in one of my codfish balls; 
Now, will I 
sue the proprietor, or will I 
punch the cook ? 
Or will 
show the rascal up in the Herald " Complaint Book?" 
SPOKEN.--TH regards to the stage— 
There's a'question I 
would like to ask, aud an answer I 
expect, 
Why Mabel Leonard from the stage they forcibly eject? 
While the mgged urchins on the street they quietly overlook, 
Our Commissioners should look after them. 
Put that down oit 
the book. 
SPOKEN.—From a 
respectable married lady— 
I've been married now five years or more, and have iielther 
kith nor kin, 
And in the shape of a 
family there's nothing yet been seen; 
While Mrs. Jones, across the way, on a 
pair of twins can look, 
Won't some one stir my husband up in the Herald " Complain% 
Book?"

child 
I 
was up to every little trick that drove my mother wild. 
I 
would take the bellows on my knee, to blow the fire I'd try, 
And when the fire began to blaze, I 
lustily would cry. 
CHORUS. 
Jeremiah, blow the fire, puff, puff, puff, 
Jeremiah, blow the fire, puff, puff, puff; 
First you do it gently, then you do it rough. 
Jeremiah, Mow the fire, puff, puff, puff. 
When I 
grew a 
little older, to a 
blacksmith I 
was bound, 
To learn the art of shoeing, which a 
bootless task I 
found. 
They cancelled my indentures, for I 
raised the boss's ire 
By shouting Out the whole day long, while dancing round the 
tire. 
Jeremiah, blow the fire, etc. 
In time I

pretty girl, and strange though it may be,

ALWAYS HELP THE POOR, 
Written by CIIARI.Es BURKE, for FRANK LEWIS, and sung by 
him with marked success. 
Oh, what a 
pleasure ' tis to have a 
man extend the band 
Of friendship to you, when perhaps a 
stranger in his land; 
But greater still to know and feel on him you can depend, 
Who proves by acts, and not mere words. the value of a 
friend. 
Then never turn your back upon a 
man because he's down. 
But always lend a 
helping hand with smiles and not with 
frowns; 
Let him but think that happiness is yet for him in store. 
And he will bless the giver, boys, who always helps the poor. 
There's the poor boys, one and all, they've many noble traits, 
The millionaire might well be proud to have within his gates; 
The poorest bootblack on our streets may yet gain wealth and 
fame, 
And smile to hear them say, he once was poor, but that's no 
shame. 
Upon the crossing of the streets you'll find them every day, 
some with barely clothes enough to keep the cold away; 
Yet happiness is beaming upon each face secure, 
For well they know they're numbered to be helped among the 
poor. 
There's the working- girls, God save them from poverty and 
shame, 
A 
cruel word in idle jest might blacken their fair name; 
Then do them all the good you can, and ne'er let it be said— 
You gave them cause to wish themselves as numbered with the 
dead. 
From midnight until early dawn you'll find some hard at work, 
While others in the stores, by day, they gain their bread as 
clerks; 
They do the best they can to keep the wolf from out their door, 
Sonic future day God will repay the man who helps the poor.

Words and Music by W ILL II. Tnimm.c. 
Performed in his 
" 
Mystic Changes." 
Good evening to you all, 
I 
hope I 
don't intrude, 
Dress in this fashion, 
Pray don't think me rude; 
I'm leader of the style, 
That's plain enough to see, 
So if you want the fashion, 
Get pinned back just like me. 
All pinned back ! all pinned back! 
It's the style, you see; 
All pinned back! all pinned back! 
That's the style for me. 
Sonic people don't like it, 
And say you cannot walk, 
While dressed in a 
pinned- back, 
But that is foolish talk; 
They are only jealous, 
And to that you agree, 
So if you like the fashion, 
Get pinned back just like me. 
All pinned back, etc.

Far away in sunny meadows, 
Where the merry sunbeams play'd, 
Oft I 
lingered 'mid the clover 
Singing to a 
village maid; 
She was fairer than the fairest, 
Ever faithful, fond and true, 
And she wore beneath a 
bonnet 
Amber tresses tied in blue. 
CE1ORU S 
She was fairer than the fairest, 
Ever faithful, fond and true, 
Andhe wore beneath a 
bonnet 
Amber tresses tied in blue. 
Ere tie summer days departed, 
We had made a 
solemn vow, 
And I 
never, never wearied 
Kissing her sweet cheek and brow; 
She was dearer than the dearest, 
Pure as crops of morning dew, 
And adown her neck was hanging 
Amber tresses tied in blue. 
She was fair 
'Twas decreed that fate should part us 
Ere the leaves of autumn fell, 
And two loving hearts were severed 
That had loved each other well; 
She was all I 
had to cherish, 
She has bade a 
last adieu, 
And I 
see in ev'ry vision 
Amber tresses tied in blue. 
She was fairer,

American Fortune- Telling Cards.—This is me old-
est and most widely known pack of Fortune-Telling Cards. We have 
published it for years, and the demand is continually increasing. 
These Cards are arr.nged and printed in series—Hearts, Clubs, Die-
m:fonds and Spades— and each or these into K for King. Q for Queen, 
and K for Knave, and numbers 1, 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
lour rows, and are to be read according to directions. 
Many of the an. 
ewers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under-
standing. 
Many professional Fortune- Tellers use these cards, and we 
are in receipt of letters in relation to them from all parts of the U. S. 
inclosed in handsome case • • Price 25 Cents. 
Courting Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
40 meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too diffi. 
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. 
The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unlady-like encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many 
lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. 
This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties

it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, as we think it would only 
enoourage the bad habit of " flirting." 
Unfortunately, there is enough 
of it done without any further necessity of explaining " how, when anei 
where to do it,'' and this little volume would advise and initiate the uz.-
Oorrupted in practicing what is commonly called "fiirting.",

"Little Flirt," published by A. J. Farrell, No. 98 Nassau street. 
It 
gives information of the modus operandi of flirting, and of the meaning 
of every motion of the handkerchief, fan, glove and parasol. 
As there 
is nothing at all objectionable in the volume, and its contents might af-
ford some innocent amusement to many, we do not hesitate to mom-
mend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers."
