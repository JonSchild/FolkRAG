[Warde?] Ford [ ' ?] PUTTING ON THE AGONY Eighteen seventy-six , January first, I sat down by my
window to write this little verse, And glancing on the street, I saw something that made me smile;
There chanced to be a dandy putting puttin' on the style, Chorus: Putting on the agony, putting
on the style. It's what the stylish people are doing all the while. When I look around me it often
makes me smile T'see so many people putting on the style. A young man in his carriage driving
just like mad, With a matched gray span of horses he's borried from his dad. He cracks his whip so
gallantly to make his lady smile, Thinks that there is nothing like putting on the style. Sweet sixteen
at meetin's sits among the boys, Turns her head and giggles at every little noise; First on one side
and then the other awhile. Thinks that there is nothing like putting on the style, Putting on the agony,
putting on the style. 2 Page 2. PUTTING ON THE AGONY It's what the stylish people are doin' all the
while. When I look around me it often makes me smile To see so many people putting on the style.
Young men in the  grogg grog ? shop smoking dirty pipes, And looking like [ pumkins pum'kins ?]
that's only partly ripe, Drinking wine and brandy,gabbling ? all the while Gee, and all, there's nothing
like (defective) (defective) putting on the style.
