Cole YoungerI am a noted vengeance man, Cole Younger is my name,And for many a depredation
that brought my folks to shame,For the robbing of the Northfield Bank, and the same I can never
deny,And for that deed I'm a poor prisoner, in Stillwater jail I lie.The first of my depreciations, I now
can tell to you;It was a California miner, his name I do not know.We robbed him of his gold, my
boys, and bade him go his way,And for that deed I know I'll rue until my dying day.Then we started
northward, when my brother Bob did say,"Now let us buy fast horses and quickly ride away,We'll
avenge the death of our father, and together we will be,And fight just like those rebel boys until
our dying day."So then we started for Texas, that good old Lone Star State.'Twas on Nebraska's
prairie, the James boys we did meet,With shining knives and revolvers did we sit down to play,With
lots of good old whiskey boys to pass the time away.The Union Pacific Railroad was the next we did
surprise,The murder with our bloody hands would bring tears to your eyes,For there on Nebraska's
prairie a brave young hero lay,And for that deed I know I'll rue until my dying day.So then we started
northward and northward we did go,To that God forsaken country called Minnesotio.Our plans
were fixed on Mankato, when Jesse James did say,"Now, Cole, if you undertake that job, you'll surely
rue the day."Then we started onward, for Northfield was the town,'Twas there we dismounted our
horses and cautiously we got down,We swore an oath of allegiance, to each other we would prove
true,And for the rest of our conversation there, I fear 'twould never do.Then we mounted our horses
and straight to the bank we rode,We stood before the counter and struck a deathly blow,Saying,
"Deliver up what cash you've got without any further delay,For we are the noted /Younger boys
and we give no time to pray." Ben RiceCole YoungerI am a bandit [?] highwayman, Cole Younger is
