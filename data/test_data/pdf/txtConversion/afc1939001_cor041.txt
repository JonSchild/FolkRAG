[Letter from Harold Spivacke to John A. Lomax; General
Delivery, Merryville, LA]
May 17, 1939
Mr. John A. Lomax General Delivery Merryville, Louisiana
Dear Mr. Lomax:
Attached are the lists which Mr. Henderson prepared in accordance with your request. If
they are not satisfactory, please let me know and I shall have them revised.
With regard to duplication, however, I should like to say that in cases where the Archive
has only the aluminum records, it might be a good idea to replace them with new acetates.
Moreover it would give the student a chance to compare changes that take place in songs
with the passage of time.
With kindest regards,
Sincerely yours, Harold Spivacke Chief, Division of Music
HS mr
