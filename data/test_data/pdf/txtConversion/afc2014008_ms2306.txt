Dear ±eSS,
 
Very brief1y 1because .
t
. am due on a field
 
trip ten minutes ago 1 I have only time to answer your
 
questions about Bessie's transcriptions.
 
(i)  Put simple guitar chords in letter indica-
tions on
 
(2)  Transpose them into practical singing key
 
and note the original key.
 
(3)  I think your tempo idea is good.
 
(4)  your decision to put the clap patterns in
 
the introduction is right.
 
(5)  Be sure to record "Nero".  it would be a
 
first although this is found in the West
 
indies.
 
Anne and .

nastily and with much love.

Dear Alan.
 
This will be a book-length letter itself  I
'm afraid; I
'll
 
try to be as brief as I can.
 
A.
 Introduction.
 (
to the game book).
 I agree it i
s
 
far too long and have taken several unsatisfactory swats at re doin  it.
 
I have been distracted and unreliable for thie past malm month due to
 
having to get Nick off and happily established at San Francisco State.
 
Naomi moved back to Berkeley and cheered up after her tough problem
 
at the camp (
the director is running about spreading stories about her
 
locally); Corey and Mike and their mountains of possessions off to
 
Berkeley, and my own rather difficult teaching schedule started.
 
Another d4 1 4 —
�
Uty
 that much of the information in the intro is
 
essential for understanding various later references throughout the
 
book so that I keep taking things out and putting them back in.
 I
 
will try again next weekend.
 The humor is around somenlace.  I sunpose;
 
surely it will turn up...

r
2.
 Credits.
 I would be insulted if I were
. Lmt
 
since I spend half my time seeing to it that credits go where they should,
 
it seems to me.
 I simply had not given any thought to the matter as
 
far as this book goes, since I assumed that what
 did when writing
 
a book was to write a page or two as the final gesture before publica-
tion so as to be sure to get in anybody who had been any help, read the
 
finished mss and made useful suggestions etc.
 So far,  those I have
 
to thank include Drs. Justin Call (my psychiatrist friend from  J
CLA
 
medical school). Joan Rayfield iog Councill Taylor who rmxdxtkm have
 
read various parts and made encouraging noises all along. Tony and Irene
 
Saletan who helped with the work sessions at Idyliwild, Ed Cray, who
 
is allowing me to quote from his KPFA interview with Bessie (
some of
 
her best talk, by the way).
/ all the Sea Islanders and Ed Young.
 
my kids, who helped with secretarial
 
were not too busy. Toni, @ presume)
 
sent t xt1a a brutally illegible carbon copy to Brian Sytton-Smith;
 
should he return it with evidence of actually having read it,  I should
 
thank him for the effort if nothing more.
 I am also thinking of sending
 
work, music copying
 
etc. when they
 
d Bessie herself
 I have

oger and/or Alan Dundes; however,  it seems k so  t
o1f f
inished
 
(
in its theoretical slant anyway) that I am afraid a
d-ef inconclu-
sive argument might develop and
 t
.  Also Wally Goldschmidt
 
if he has anything to say.
 
took a look at mp a part of it; I will see
 
So, I had assumed that what would happen is that after
 
the book was accepted and I zmmtdxd was working on the clean-up bits
 
(a discography, further bibliography and annotations ±fxt
x
i* t
h z x
 
w
txt
x are yet to be added) I would write a couple of pages of appre-
ciative statements concerning all these people.
 Since this is my f
irst
 
literary production, maybe this isn't the way I should have done it,
 
but the t
i
ieaió
oesn't reflect the intentions.
 
It seems to me that you obviously deserve credit for:
 
"discovering" Bessie, your lengthy and sex sensitive interviews through
 
which she was able to recall so vividly her early life, your basic
 
direction of her late career, the idea for the Idyllwild workshop to
 
L
t
X
 
begin with, aw
t uia
 t the only theoretical reading I was able to find
 
plus, of course, help in the  *n * editing an  selling.
 
which was any help in understanding the materiall  I do feel, however
 
that this must skmismaky be put in such a way that it does not down-
to have been
 
grade Bessie, or make her seem /manipulated by that Machiavellian
 
Lomax family.
 I will work on it and send you a copy of the paragra h
 
I was intending to write on this.
 If you have any suggestions  let me
 
have them.
 
.go  in the book tr
nder ackno w-
ledgments or som e such t
-itie,,o
.r perha s -
 tacked on the introduction.
 
ow all this,  I assume, would go in the book und;r
 
acknowledgments or some such title, or perhaps he r tacked on the
 
introduction.
 Concerning the title page and legal credits, I am on
 
unfamiliar ground; it would seem to be more a legal than a moral
 
question, and I imagine that,  like most legal business, however it
 
comes out will be unsatisfactory to somebody.
 1
y own posttion,  I
 
think,  is this.
 I feel that the part of the book I can lay claim to
 
the idea of doing it.
,
 
is the bookriess of it itself :
/the organization  the essays, the theo-
itself
 
retical position m and so on.
 The material *tz* *  (the games etc.)
 
I would feel are Bessie's and yours according to whatever arrangements
 
you have worked out.  Although I suppose the musical transcription
 
and game descriptions /1 could claim a part of'as transcriber ,
 this

seems much too complicated/and I would just as soon waive
 rights
 
there.

As for what I want, it isn't money because I never expect
 
to get any really, though I do have a need for publication

neither of which I have at the moment.
 
and professional recognition/  What kind of wording would keep it all
 
straight?  A co-authorship between Bessie  you and me?  By me "with
 
Bessie Jones and Alan Lomax"? I would appreciate it if you would make
 
any suggestions; I am particularly concerned about the legal results

y working procedure has been as follows:
 I transcribed
 
all relevant songs and cotnmentaties from all tapes: your tapes
 
4
k30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37 (not all of which were complete
 
in the copies you sent me, I believe)  my own tapes (Bess 5-1
 
through 11), and relevant songs from Atlantic AMERICAN FOLK SONGS
 
FOR CHILDREN, and the Prestige Series:  DEEP SOUTH SACRED AND
 
SINFUL and GEORGIA SEA ISLANDS VOL II, also a very fine interview
 
over KPFK conducted by Ed Cray.
 Ed has given me verbal permission
 
to quote from his tape f
tx2s Song texts were transcribed  u x ox from all versions
 
and combined on occasion; most variation was so slight I don't feel
 
it's worth figuring out now exce p t for Sandy Ree  in which there was
 
considerable variation from take to take.
 In the rare case where
 
there was any significant change in the text of a word or two. I
 
used my own o
l editorial discretion.
 
Music was transcribed roughly from all sources and
 
a satisfactory (to me) compromise reached.
 Pitch and tempo was taken
 
in all cases possible from California recordings, since these were
 
taken while the dance or game was being played; essentially, then.
 
the music is
 from the California versions
 
by and large.
 
Quotations were taken by me from the complete trans-
criptions of all interviews concerning each song; those not contained
 
in the above lists came either from my interviews or Ed Cray's.
