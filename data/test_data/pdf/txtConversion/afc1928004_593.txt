In the ebening by de moonlight, when dis darkey's work 
was over, 
We would gather round de fire, till de hoe-cake it was 
done; 
Den we all would eat our supper, after dat we'd clear de 
kitchen, 
Dat's de only time we had to spare, to hab a 
little fun; 
Uncle Gabe would take de fiddle down, dat hung upon do 
wall, 
While de silvery moon was shining clear and bright; 
how de old folks would enjoy it, dey would sit all night 
and listen, 
As we sang in de ebening by the moonlight. 
Cnottus: 
In de ebening by de moonlight, you could bear us darkies 
singing, 
In de ebening by de moonlight, you could hear de banjo 
ringing; 
How de old folks would enjoy it, dey would sit all night 
and listen, 
As we sang in de ebening by de moonlight. 
In de ebening by de moonlight, when cle watch-dog would 
be sleeping, 
in de corner near de fire-place, beside de old arm-chair; 
Whar Aunt Chloe used to sit and tell de piccaninnies sto-
ries, 
And de cabin would be filled wid merry coons from near 
and far; 
All dem happy times we used to hab, will ne'er return 
again, 
Eb'rything was then so merry, gay and bright; 
And I 
neber will forget it, when our daily toil was °bort 
How we sang in de ebening by de moonlight.

SONS OF HAM. 
Written by AI A 
NN1E FRIEND. Sung by JAMES A
.. BLAND. Copyrighted

0 : 
The Order that we're members of, 
Is known both far and wide, 
Our rules and regulations from 
The world at large we hide; 
Our communications all are held, 
When night succeeds the day, 
Our countersigns and grips we give, 
As only brethren may. 
Our officers all stationed, 
Are East, West, North and South, 
To be elected as one of these, 
You must have a 
good sized mouth; 
Live on the Square and 
Never give each other any lip, 
And under every circumstance, 
We carry a 
policy slip. 
CHORUS. 
For we are known as the " Sons of Ham," 
Our order is spread throughout the land, 
Where'er you go, we'll have you know, 
You will find the Sons of Ham. 
In robes of white we always meet,. 
With sabres by our side, 
When members we initiate, 
They all the Goat must ridei 
Slide up and down the golden stair, 
Drink of the nectar sweet, 
Entering the portals of the lodge, 
The members they must greet. 
Our Grand Mogul is always dressed, 
in a 
gown of pink and gold, 
And to his right our Scribe you'll find 
Who writes down what is told; 
Our Deacons, Tylers and Wardens, too, 
On hand you'll always find, 
And when there's business before the lodge, 
'Tis then you'll hear their mind. 
To gain admittance to the Lodge, 
Upon a 
meeting night, 
A member has to give the sign, 
To see if he is right; 
Spit on the floor then shake his head, 
And look down at his feet, 
his hands must clasp behind his back, 
Thus the Guardian he must greet. 
Our Guardian then to him does say, 
"From whence does Brother come?" 
The answer then you'll quickly bear, 
"I'm Southwest from the Sun;" 
Then three times three he gives the rap, 
And the Brother is led within, 
lie takes his place, puts on his robes, 
And our services begin,

Though silence and coldness have us parted forever, • 
I 
have come to tell, with deep pain in my heart, 
For the sake of the past and the love you once bore me, 
Oh 'twere but right that we in friendship should part. 
Even now, while the wound you inflicted is aching, 
A 
voice in my heart pleads in soft tones for you; 
Who wavered and faltered, were fickle and altered, 
Oh, why were you false, when you could have been true? 
Cnonus, 
'Why were you false, why so unkind, 
How could you forget one who lived but foi you% 
The vows that were spoken, by you have been broken, 
Farewell forever, why were you untrue? 
Long years may elapse, and my name be forgotten, 
Although you once feared was my love for you true, 
But my love you accepted, first craved, then neglected, 
Whate'er unto others, I 
was faithful to you. 
New pleasures may greet you, new faces may meet you, 
. 
New loves for a 
time your heart may entwine; 
Their friendship though newer, can never be truer, 
Or ever as tender or faithful as mine. (Chorus).

:0: 
My darling is a 
cashier, 
In a 
fancy dry-goods place; 
She keeps the cash all straight and square, 
With such an air and grace. 
She makes the change with such a 
dash, 
And very stylish air, 
That when it's done she sings out " cash," 
There's music in the air! ' 
CHORUS: 
Oh she's sweet, and she is fair, 
Full of styles and bangs her hair; 
She wears pull-backs and bangles rare, 
Oh site's a 
ducksey darling. 
Oh, then on Summer nights, you know, 
When business hours are done; 
We take a 
walk or else we go, 
To Central Park for fun. 
There stroll around and take an ice, 
Then in some arbor nigh, 
She'll say to me it's very nice, 
But dear, don't muss my tie. (Chorus).

MY DARTANG LADY CASETItri—toyrIN-crEn. 
On Sunday when the weather's fair, 
She gets herself up so; 
Regardless of expense or care, 
In style from top to toe. 
With silk and satin, plumes and bows, 
And spit-curls on her brow; 
She's everlasting sweet, you know, 
Don't you forget it now. (Chorus). 
To Coney Island then we go, 
To have a 
jolly swim; 
The fellows all, they eye her so, 
But she only " takes it in." 
And when some sprig makes up to her, 
With such an air and dash, 
She only says young man, see here. 
Now don't you be so fresh. 
(
Chorus). 
And now next Spring she's promised me, 
To be my darling bride; 
We've bought the furniture, you see, 
And a 
cradle, too, beside. 
For when we're married, I 
presume 
As others always do, 
It will get filled—well—very soon, 
With little cashiers, too.

Pity the poor this cold winter night, 
Keen blows the wind with merciless might, 
Fa ,t 
falls the snow, oh, turn not away! 
Hunger and want on every hand stray; 
Give of a 
portion heaven has sent, 
Ye who are blessed with wealth . 
and content, 
Ye who have homes so cheerful and bright, 
Pity the poor this cold winter night. 
Cuoitus: 
Turn not away, give, give of your store, 
Some weary heart make happy once more; 
Hark to their cry, their pleading don't 
Pity the poor this cold winter night. 
Cheerfully give and God will return, 
Thy brother's call, oh never more spurn, 
Always with us the poor still abide, 
Pass them not by, and turn not aside; 
Shivering forms with no where to go, 
Wearily plod, or crouch in the snow; 
Spare what you can, if only a 
mite, 
Pity the poor this cold winter night. (Chorus). 
Do what you can, while journeying here, 
Some weary soul we always may cheer, 
Lighten the load of poverty's curse, 
All can spare some, though meagre their purse; 
Blessings and joys your days will pursue, 
11lany are poor, the wealthy are few; 
All could be helped. if all give their mite, 
Pity the poor tbi$ cold winter night.

Though seas now divide, and the mountains so wide, 
I'll never once forget you far away; 
But I 
treasure still the tlower that you gave me one 
sweet hour, 
When we watched the lads and lasses dancing gay, 
You've longed for my coming, and I've wept bitter 
tears, 
Your Scotch lassie still is your own; 
She never will be false, for her heart she left with you 
No! your lassie, blue-eyed lassie will be true. 
Cuoitus: 
Oh, laddie, my laddie far away, 
Still would your darling die for you; 
She never will be false, ah, no! no matter what they 
say, 
No, your lassie, blue-eyed lassie will be true. 
Then, love, don't forget that I 
think of you yet, 
Mid Scotland's bonnie hills across the sea; 
And though far away I 
roam, au! I 
know there is a 
home 
That is waiting there, my own, for you and me; 
I'll come to you laddie, like the bird to its nest, 
For still I 
am praying for you; 
of all this world so fair I 
am loving you the best, 
And your lassie, blue-eyed lassie will be true.

Send Me A 
Rose From My Angel 
THE TENDERNESS OF LOVING. 
Mother's Grave. 
Music for sale and Copyrighted by B. W. llacitcocii. 166 Nassau 
Street, N. Y. Sung by BILLY BIRCH, Fs9. 
I've been thinking to-day of the happy years ago, 
And the tears quickly gathered in my eyes; 
As I 
held within my hand a 
portrait and a 
flower, 
Tokens bound to me by many sacred ties. 
The picture is my mothers, and she sent it cross the 
sea, 
And a 
blessing to her wandering son she gave; 
And this little faded flower blossomed on the grassy 
mound, 
For they sent me a 
rose from mother's grave. 
Ctionus: 
When you kneel down in prayer near the spot where 
she's laid, 
Remember this favor that I 
crave; 
Oh! take from the holy ground a 
blossom from the 
mound, 
And send me a 
rose from mothers grave. 
I 
would give all this world if it were mine to give, 
If my mother could return to me again; 
I 
would strive then to repay lu.,r 
many acts of love, 
For my heart is calling, and it calls in vain. 
Neer more to feel her kisses and her words of bright-
est cheer; 
When she bid me hope, be patient, true and brave, 
And I 
keep my little flower ever near where e'er I 
go, 
For it blossomed on my angel mother's grave. 
Composed by H. P. DANES. Copyrighted 1.80. by B. W. HiTcucocK 
166 Nassau Street, N. V. Sung by MINNIE LEE. 
All the earth is filled with blessing, 
Which no sorrow can destroy, 
And for every day of trouble, 
There shall come a 
day of joy; 
There are moments full of silver, 
All the showers from Heaven which fall, 
And the tenderness of loving, 
Is the blessing of them all. 
Cnouns: 
Though the clouds may hang above 
Somewhere sunlight lingers still; 
And the good of every moment, 
Shall surpass the moment's ill; 
Love and trust are yet immortal, 
Loving souls immortal, too; 
And the glory of a 
jewel, 
Sparkles in a 
drop of dew. 
Take the dew-drops as God gives them, 
Be they moments be they hours, 
So the stream of life which bears you, 
Shall flow on through banks of flowers; 
There are moments full of blessing, 
As the showers from Heaven which fall, 
But the tenderness of loving, 
Is the blessedness of all.

I'm far away from the home I 
love, 
And my heart is sad and forlorn; 
I 
often think of my boyhood hours, 
Also the place where I 
was born. 
But Nellie my darling awaits my return, 
Her sweet face I'm longing to see; 
There's a 
sighing in my heart which keeps 
whispering, 
There's a 
dear one waiting for me. 
Cuonus: 
I'll soon return to my home again, 
How happy then I 
will be; 
When I'm welcomed back by in 
Nellie, 
For my darling is waiting for me. 
I've traveled across the ocean wide, 
And in strange countries have I 
been; 
I've been among people of all kinds, 
But no place like home have I 
seen. 
I'm longing to be back with my little dear, 
To my home across the wide sea; 
Oh, I'm weary and sad since we parted, 
There's a 
dear one waiting for me. 
While thinking about my childhood's days, 
When I 
used to play on the 
How oft I've roamed with my Nellie dear, 
I 
love to recall those bright scenes. 
Remembered and cherished are those childish 
hours, 
A 
wander no longer I'll be; 
For my darling is waiting and watching, 
There's a 
dear one waiting for me.

On Scotland's fair hills, or the mountains and rills, 
I've wandered there many a 
happy day; 
In looking at the lads and the lasses on the green, 
'Neath the fine old hills of Scotland far away. 
I've looked for her coming, but she's not come as yet, 
The truth seems to dawn on me plain; 
They say she is false but I'll still believe her mine, 
She's my darling blue-eyed Scotch lassie Jean. 
0 Jean, my dearest Jean! 
Come to your laddie once again; 
They say you are false, but I'll still believe you mine, 
You're my darling blue-eyed Scotch lassie Jean. 
She said she soon would meet me, but I've waited long in 
vain, 
In lands far away she doth roam; 
Her promise she will keep, 0 ! break it not, my Jean, 
We'll be happy in our bonnie little home. 
Then let me not long wait, let me meet you soon, my Jean, 
And Heav'n will then smile on our love; 
And when life is ended, we'll leave this earthly scene, 
When our hearts will dwell in joy and bliss above.

Jean, my dearest Jean! 
Come to your laddie once again; 
They say you are false, but I'll still believe you rAine.,, 
You're my darling blue-eyed Scotch lassie Jean. 
Written by JOHN W ALSH, and dedicated to and sung by NED BARRI4 
at the Theatre, Comique, N. Y. 
What curious people we meet 
As through this world we go; 
Some are full of deceit, 
While others honesty show; 
Some on mischief are bent, 
If you far from it will roam; 
And others like to interfere, 
With business that's not their own. 
Some will swear that white is black, 
And green is no color at all; 
And others seem to take delight 
in watching another man fall; 
But when inquisitive people 
Wish to know anything from me; 
I 
tell them to ask the sailor, 
For the sailor has been to sea. 
CHORUS: 
For the jolly, old sailor, has been to sea, 
Where the stormy winds do blow; 
And as the sailor has been to sea, 
He's the man that ought to know: 
Old Brigham Young he is dead, 
In picture shape they show 
A comical sketch of his bed, 
And his forty wives also; 
THE JOLLY OLD SAILOR— CONTINUED. 
With sixty babes in the front, 
His breeches you'll see hanging there; 
Now there's a 
chance for young girls, 
Who would like the breeches to wear. 
Just fancy having forty wives, 
To please and amuse every one; 
They tell Inc Brigham did it, 
But it's wonderful how it was done; 
For I 
have one, and upon my word, 
She's more than enough for me; 
And one's a 
dose, I've heard it said, 
By the sailor that's been to sea. (Chorus). 
There's Smikes just over the way, 
He gets so awfully wild; 
And grumbles all the day, 
Because he's not blessed with a 
child; 
Whilst Smith can boast twenty-four, 
And looks with a 
doleful phiz; 
And says that Smikes should be compelled, 
To keep a 
few of his kids. 
Now when they meet, it's quite a 
treat, 
It causes a 
deal of fun; 
For the one that's got no children, 
Asks the other one how it is done; 
One says this, and the other says that, 
But when they refer to me, 
I 
tell them to ask the sailor, 
For the sailor has been to sea. (Chorus). 
DONNELLY AND COOPER. 
Written by Dick Devlin and sung by Devlin and Tracy 
Come all you true-bred Irishmen, I 
hope -you will draw 
near, 
And likewise pay attention to those few lines you hear;. 
It's of as true a 
story as ever you did hear, 
It's about Donnelly and Cooper, that fought all on Kildare. 
'Twas on the 3d of June, brave boys this challenge sent 
o'er, 
From Brittania to old Grauna to renew her sons once more; 
To renew her satisfaction, and her credit to recall, 
For they're all in deep distraction since Donnelly con-
quered all. 
Old Grauna read .the challenge and received and she 
smiled, 
Saying; " You'd better hasten to Kildare, my Ns-ell beloved 
child, 
There you will reign victorious, which you often did before. 
And your deeds will shine so gloriously around old Erin:s 
shore." 
The challenge was accepted; these heroes did prepare 
To meet brave Captain Kelly on the Curragh of Kildare; 
When these two bully champions were stripped off in the 
ring, 
They both were still determined on each other's blood to 
spill. 
DONNELLY AND COOPER.—Continued. 
From 6 
to 9, parried their time, till Donnelly knocked him 
down, 
Old Grauna smiled: " Well done, my child; that is ten 
thousand pound!" 
The second round that Cooper fought, he knocked down 
Donnelly, 
Likewise true game was Donnelly, he rose most furiously. 
Right active then was Cooper—he knocked Donnelly 
down again; 
Those Englishmen then gave three cheers, saying. " The 
battle's all in vain." 
Long life to brave Miss Kelly; she's recorded on the plain ; 
She boldly stepped into the ring, saying: " Dan, my boy, 
what do you mane ? 
"My Irish boy," said she, " my whole estate I 
have bet 
out on you, brave Donnelly." 
Donnelly rose again, and meeting with great might, 
And to stagnate those nobles all, continued to his tight, 
• 
Cooper stood in his own defence; exertion proved in vain, 
He soon received a 
temple blow that knocked him on the 
plain. 
Now you sons of proud Brittania, your boasting now recall. 
Since Cooper, now, by Donnelly, he met a 
sad downfall, 
Out of eleven rounds gave nine knock-downs and broke 
his jaw- bone ; 
"Shake hands," said she. - brave Donnelly, the battle's all 
our own."

Her wool is straight, her lips do curl,

Such a

She weighs a

She's all mine, she's my own love.

Oh, this daisy is my own love, 
A sweet dove, a

To the ball we both will go, love; 
Our style will make excitement great, 
We'll take the cake when there, love.

Good evening, kind friends, we have just stepped in, 
If you'll listen, we'll tell who we are; 
We are a 
pleasant old couple as you can see, 
And we are known both near and far; 
We are old and gray, and we are on our way, 
Through the pathway of life; 
And as we pass by, the young folks they cry, 
There's old Mr. Logan and wife. 
CnoRus:

She.—I'm Mrs. Logan, 
Both.—Old Mr. Logan and wife; 
She's Mrs. Logan, I'm Mr. Logan,

We've settled down for life you see, 
In our little old country home; 
Two boys and a 
girl was our happy lot, 
So you see we are not left alone; 
Our life's a 
dream, with joy supreme, 
Devoid of care and strife; 
And as we pass by, the young folks all say, 
There's old Mr. Logan and wife.

They'd elevate their eyes and say, 
It's not the proper thing. 
We steal away to visit you, 
And please you 'tis the truth, 
Uncle Abe and sister Ruth. 
We're going back to Quakertown, 
We'll take the early train; 
And when the watermelon's ripe, 
We'll visit you again. 
So keep us in your memory,

And hope I

Though all mankind' my friend; 
The darling girls, the pretty dears, 
In ulsters cut a

How long before their chins will sprout, 
That's more than I

I 
know a 
widow, nice and sweet, 
And so bewitching, too; 
I 
breathed my passion at her feet, 
And swore my love was true; 
But widows they are dreadful sly, 
And oft turn out a 
sell; 
-Who kissed those lips when I 
vamoosed? 
That's more than I

pretty wife, 
The parson visits there; 
I 
can't see why, upon my life. 
Each day, through foul or fair; 
If duty calls him to her side, . 
Her griefs or cares to quell; 
Or comfort to her soul he brings, 
That's more than I 
can tell.

That's more than I

Will each of them have wings to flop? 
That's more than I

The preachers now are up in arms, 
To shut the playhouse doors; 
They preach about the awful harms, 
That wicked actors cause; 
Though black sheep dwell in every flock, 
How many parsons swell 
The ranks of scandal every year? 
That's more than I 
can tell. 
CHORUS: 
That's more than I 
can tell, 
That's mar° than I 
can tell, 
Why don't they let the actors rest? 
That's more than I

FLORA BELL. 
Words by J. M. JOHNSON, and sung by JOHNSON S: 
SwiIN 
with great success. 
In Maryland I 
had a 
farm, 
And happy, oh, so happy there did dwell; 
'Till I 
fell in love with a 
colored girl, 
Her name was Flora Bell. 
I 
east my eyes upon her face 
She bound me like a 
spell; 
And from that moment I 
loved that girl, 
Oh my pretty, my pretty Flora Bell. 
In joy I 
then did marry her, 
And happy, oh, so happy there did dwell; 
There were none so happy in all Maryland, 
As I 
and Flora Bell. 
When a 
white man came to Maryland, 
With some slaves to buy and sell; 
Ile so enticed that be bore away 
3fy pretty, oh, my pretty Flora Bell. 
Broken hearted and weary, 
I 
wandered alone through the del! 
When a 
colored girl fell at my feet, 
I 
saw it was Flora Bell. 
I 
thanked the Lord that I 
loved her still, 
When into in 
arms she fell; 
But in my arms she fell and died, 
My pretty, oh, my pretty Flora Bell.

Title and music composed by PADDY MURPHY. 
Copyrighted by A. 3. FISHER, 187g. 
We've heard marshal songs and songs of the sea; 
Love songs and comic songs, but they don't suit me. 
We love to sing of Ireland—sweet land of our birth— 
I'm Paddy, her son, and she's my mother earth. 
Oh Erin, my country it grieves us to see 
Our enemies prosper. and yet we are not free. 
We fight for other countries as through life we roam. 
When half of our fighting would free our old home. 
CHORUS. 
Then hurrah fdr the sons of Erin's Isle! 
Hurrah for the daughters, who on us do smile I 
A 
fig for her foes, where-ever they may be ; 
Three cheers for old Ireland and sweet liberty. 
Then arise, sons of Erin, and prove to the world 
The sunburst of freedom is once more unfurled. 
Be united like brothers, and join hand in hand, 
Then you'll drive the proud Saxon from off of our land 
Sure the land is the people's, and who dare to dispute 
The word of our maker—for he spoke the truth. 
Then desend from the hill, and arise from the glen, 
And once more the battle of freedom begin. 
Then hurrah, &c.

THE WATERMILL. 
As recited by Gus IVILLiams, at the Olympic Theatre. 
Listen to the watermill, through the livelong day, 
flow the clicking of its wheel wears the hours away, 
Languidly the autumn wind stirs the greenwood leaves, 
From the fields the reapers sing, binding up the sheaves; 
And a 
proverb haunts my mind, as a 
spell is cast— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Autumn winds revive no more leaves that once are shed, 
And iie sickle cannot reap corn once gathered; 
And the rippling stream flows on, tranquil, deep and still, 
Never gliding back again to the watermill. 
Truly speaks the proverb old, wai a 
meaning vast— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Take the lesson to thyself, loving heart and true, 
Golden years are fleeting by, youth is passing, too; 
Learn to make the most of life, lose no happy day, 
Time will never bring thee back chances swept away. 
Leave no tender word unsaid, love, while love shall last— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Work while yet the daylight shines, man of strength and will, 
Never does the streamlet glide useless by the mill; 
Wait not till to- morrow's sun beams upon the way, 
All that thou canst call thine own lies in thy— to- day, 
Power, intellect and health may not always last— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Oh! the wasted hours of life that have drifted by, 
Ohl the good we might have done, lost without a 
sigh! 
Love that we might once have saved by a 
single word, 
Thoughts conceived, but never penned, perishing unheard, 
Take the proverb to thine heart, take and hold it fast— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Ohl love thy God and fellow-man, thyself consider last, 
'or come it will, when thou must scan dark errors of the past; 
And when the fight of life is o'er, and earth recedes from view, 
And Heaven in all its glory shines, 'midst the pure, the good 
the true. 
Then you'll see more clearly the proverb deep and vast— 
The mill will never grind wi,g.  
the water that is past. 
BILLY BARRY'S PINAFORE. 
Composed, and sung with great success by the Great 
Billy Barry. 
I 
am the monarch of Limburger cheese, 
When I 
eat, it's go as you please; 
I 
wear piccadilly's and tight- legged pants, 
And so does my sisters, cousins and my aunts. 
Now I 
think that it's awfully mean, 
To treat a 
girl to ice cream, 
When you've only got a 
half-a-dollar in your pants, 
And she invites all her sisters, her cousins and her aunts, 
Henry Ward Beecher is a 
fine plum, 
He says that he never drinks rum, 
But he'll kiss a 
pretty girl when he gets a 
chance, 
And he'll never tell his sisters, cousins or his aunts. 
I 
am a 
pedestrian by trade, 
Seven hundred and fifty miles I've made, 
1'11 make another lap if they'll give me the chance, 
For to sit on my sisters, cousins and aunts.

Recitation, as. delivered by FRA.NK 
Dar's a 
lone grave on de oder side of de creek 
Dat knows no Decoration Day, 
For him who over yonder sleeps 
Is only a 
Nigger, dey say! 
Dey gave him his freedom, but took away his home, 
He died an old vagrant, entirely unknown, 
And left not a 
soul to be sad 
But an ole yaller dog—'twas all dat he had. 
Dey dug a 
rude hole and chucked him away, 
Dis poor ole colored slave; 
.N ot a 
prayer for his rest did anyone say, 
And dat ole yaller dog lay down on his grave, 
And dar you can see him day after day, 
At morning, at eve and at noon; 
But dar's no inducements can drive him away 
From his place beside de grave of a 
coon. 
Dar's a 
mighty fine monument close by, 
But to me dis little mound looks bigger; 
For dar's a 
monument money can't buy— 
A yaller dog's love for a 
nigger. 
The Tramp. 
As recited by aul COLLYER. 
Lemme sit down a 
minute, a 
stone's got in my shoe; 
Don't you commence your cussin', I 
ain't done nothin' to you. 
Yes, I'm a 
tramp. 
What of it ? 
Folks say we ain't no good 
But tramps has to live, I 
reckon, though folks don't think we 
should. 
Once I 
was strong and handsome, had plenty of cash and 
clothes, 
That was afore I 
tippled and gin got into my nose 
Down : n 
the Lehigh Valley me and my people grew, 
I 
was a 
blacksmith, Cap'en—yes, and a 
good one, too; 
Me and my wife and Nellie. 
Nellie was just sixteen, 
She was the pootiest creeter the Valley had ever seen. 
Beaux? Why, she had a 
dozen—had ' em from near and fur, 
But they were mostly farmers—none of 'em suited her. 
There was a 
city stranger—young, handsome, and tall, 
Damn him—I 
wish I 
had him strangled agin.that wall. 
He was the man for Nellie—she didn't know no ill; 
Mother, she tried to stop it, but you know a 
young gal's will. 
Well, it's the same old story—common enough, you'll say, 
He was a 
soft-tongued devil, and got her to run away. 
More than a 
month or tfter we heard from the poor young 
thing, 
He'd gone away and left her without a 
wedding ring. 
Back to her home we brought her, back to her mother's side, 
Filled with a 
raging fever—she fell at my feet and died. 
Frantic -with shame and trouble, her mother began to sink, 
Dead—in less than a 
fortnight—that's when I 
took to drink. 
Gimme one glass, Curnel, and then I'll be on my way, 
tramp till I 
find that scoundrel, if it takes till the Judg-
ment Day.

As sting by T. M. HENarmit 
I 
am growing old and feeble, 
My hair is turning gray; 
My limbs are weak and painful— 
Are stiff, and won't obey. 
My dancing days are over, 
My pleasures are all gone; 
For goodness, not for greatness, 
You'll miss me when I'm gone.

There is one kind heart will miss me, when I'm gone 
When I'm gone, you will miss me; 
When I'm gone, you will miss me; 
There is one kind heart will miss me, when I'm gout.. 
What will you do without me 
When Winter time comes on? 
Who'll fold their arms around you, 
Is I

Who'll hug you, and caress you, 
-When I

You'll know where you can find me,

pray you don't come near me, 
For I 
fell in love with such a 
dove, 
Df my heart she is the queen. 
As she sweetly smiled she set me wild, 
With love I 
shall go crazy; 
For I 
scarcely knew just what to do, 
tier smile was so serene, 
Like a 
little dove in clover, 
And before I 
knew it this darling she had won me; 
She's the fairest, she's the rarest, 
She's a 
little dove in clover over there. 
CHORUS. 
With sweet laughing eyes, like the sunrise, 
She looked so fair, bewitching, 
And the world to me now seems to be 
So full of laughing eyes. 
With this little pet I 
met 
In golden mild September, 
How my heart it beat, she looked so sweet, 
Oh, I 
never can forget; 
And so now you see, she's the world to me, 
Her loving smile enchains me, 
And her eyes of blue they pierce me through. 
I 
wish the time was set. 
She's a 
little dove in clover, 
But will her love be true? I 
often sit and wonder. 
She's a 
darling, she's a 
starling, 
She's a 
little clove in clover over there.

THERE is a 
girl not far from here, 
• 
Who stole my heart away; 
Her eyes are bright as stars at night, 
So lively and so gay. 
We met 'twas in a 
woodland dell, 
Where berries sweet do grow; 
'Twas there we plighted both our loTee, 
And I 
named her my June Rose. 
CHORUS. 
For she's just as pretty as a 
bouquet of 
That in the garden grows; 
And she has promised to be mine, 
My lovely sweet June Rose. 
We often meet each pleasant eve, 
And wander through the grove; 
And while the moon is beaming brighl 
We whisper then our love. 
Until the parting hour comes, 
Then from her I 
must go; 
But when she's mine no more I'll par' 
From my lovely sweet June Rose.

See that my Grave is Whitewashed 
Every Summer. 
Written by JAS. NicAvov expressly for the SPARKS BRarnEtzs, and sung 
by them with tremendous success. 
When I've cashed in my checks, little Rosebud, 
When I 
am six foot under the turf, 
I 
forgive you, but you played me for a 
gilly, 
You worked me for every nickel I 
was worth. 
Oh, you said I 
could look, but mustn't touch, 
And you put me in such a 
dilemma; 
But there is one little snap I 
want to fake up between us— 
That is, see that my glave is whitewashed every summer. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, the days will come to your poison face. 
Think of how you backcapped inc when I 
was living. 
Clean the snow off, when I'm planted, with a 
shovel, 
darling, 
And decorate my grave with turkeys' breasts, Thanks..

Don't get cranky when I 
ask you to remember, 
When you used to give me taffy on the stick, 
And with your funny gags you paralyzed me— 
But, my darling, you can't say I 
ever kicked. 
I 
will meet you in the happy land of Canaan, 
Tra-la-lee, skip the sewer, for you are my baby; 
Plant huckleberry trees in the next lot to where I'm 
planted, darling, 
And see that my grave is kept shady.

Where the water lilies grow, 
And the zephyrs gently blow, 
Where the waters softly flow, 
Meet me darling Annie. 
When the whippoorwill doth call, 
. And the dewdrops softly fall, 
While the moon shines over all, 
Kiss me darling Annie.

When the flowers fall asleep 
And the moon shines o'er the deep, 
Tell me I 
your heart may keep, 
Then, my darling Annie. 
Hearken to the turtle dove, 
Cooing from his nest above, 
List'ning to the tale of love, 
Whisper'd unto Annie. 
How he envies me the bliss, 
Pressing such a 
form as this, 
How he wishes he might kiss 
Your sweet lips, my Annie. 
When the flowers fall asleep, Ix. 
While the little stars do shine, 
Place your snowy hand in mine,

About twelve o'clock upon one 'Winter's night, 
Keep it mum; 
When this individual came to light, 
Keep it mum; 
When I 
was a 
lad, I 
was very headstrong, 
With my teacher at school I 
could not get along; 
But I 
hope what I'll tell you to-night in my song, 
You'll keep it mum.

The husband comes home from his 
club 
late 
at night 
Keep it mum; 
When the sun it is shining at break of daylight, 
Keep it mum; 
He tells his dear wife he's been out with a 
friend, 
And, of course, it was business he had to attend; 
She believes all he says, ' till in nine months they send 
'Well, keep it mum. 
Some wives get religion when parsons do call, 
Keep it mum; 
On a 
glass of old toddy, they glory do bawl, 
Keep it mum; 
The husband goes to labor up town, 
The parson stops at me, do not frown, 
Alone, when together, they glory rake down, 
But keep it mum. 
Now, there is Bob Ingersoll says there no hell, 
Keep it mum, 
That is the doctrine Robert does tell, 
Keep it mum; 
Now Bobby may walk, he may preach, he may pray 
And talk about Hell in his own funny way; 
But, perhaps he will find it out some future day, 
He'll keep it mum. 
As sung by W M. J. 
SCANLON. 
Only to see you, darling, 
Only to hear your voice, 
Even it's faintest whisper 
Would make my heart rejoice. 
Vainly I 
crave the sunshine 
Thy love would e'er impart, 
Longing once more to see thee, 
Once more before we part. 
Cnonus. 
Only to see you, darling, 
Only to hear your voice, 
Even it's faintest whisper 
Would make my heart rejoice. 
Gone is the sunlit future, 
Vision of joy so bright, 
Now every gleam bath faded, 
Vanished in darkest night. 
Too late, alas! I 
knew thee, 
Ah I 
could my poor heart tell, 
Breathe out it's bitter anguish 
in that sad wor0, farewell. 
(Chorus.) 
:ekki.t; 
I 
took my girl, Johannah, 
To a 
restaurant one night; 
She stuffed herself with cod-fish balls, 
Sauce, pigs feet and tripe; 
She called for roast, called for toast, 
She called for stew and fried; 
With a 
knife and fork she'd dive in pork, 
In grease up to her eyes. 
Cnonts; 
Oh, Johannah, she could eat immense, 
She nearly had me killed; 
For I 
hadn't but fifteen cents, 
Oh, Johannah, let up, 
I 
loud did bawl; 
I 
lost my breath, and suffered death, 
For the girl with the hungry gaul. 
The night we went to the restaurant, 
I 
remember well; 
She was longing for some oysters, 
And took them on the shell; 
She bent her head and shoulders, 
Like a 
preacher, in a 
prayer; 
And when she drew them up again, 
The oyster was not there. 
Says she. R. G., this just suits me, 
Its bully, its immense; 
Then she began to eat again, 
You know, at my expense; 
I 
told the landlord I 
was broke, 
The waiter at me stared; 
Then they grabbed thi4 delicate mar., 
And throwed me down the stair.

A YOUNG man to this city came, 
In walking he was slightly game, 
Patricius was his maiden name— 
McGinniss. 
The boys they used to call him gimps, 
As on the street he'd slowly limp, 
,They sold him Croton bugs for shrimp--
McGinniss. 
Taking a 
kind friend's gooa advice, 
lie went and got a 
job so nice, 
In the undertaker's, cracking ice— 
At first the times were rather rough, 
But now he's doing well enough, 
For he can stand them—he is tough— 
Met linniss. 
Long live that good young man, say I, 
And when time comes for him to die, 
Free lunches one and all will cry— 
MY DEAR LITTLE HOMES 
By Harry Percy of Concross & Dixey's minstrels, sung by vt* 
rIENRIETTA BAZZEL, of Newport, Ky. 
THERE'S a 
little white cot that is dearer than life, 
Where I 
haste when the day's toil is o'er, 
Where I 
carry no thought of the world's eager strife, 
When I 
enter its low humble door. 
Oh! the smile of a 
fond loving wife there 
see, 
And I 
hear all the children's glad tone, 
This earth has no tfeasure more sweeter to me, 
Than the dear little home of my own. 
Cnottus. 
I've a 
dear little home, yes .a 
home of my own, 
I've a 
nice little home of my own, 
And no king is more proud as he sits on his throne; 
Than am I 
in my dear little home. 
Oh! when ever I 
roam from this little white cot, 
In the hurry and noise of the day, 
My heart gladly turns to that heaven-like spot, 
And I 
long to its shelters to stray. 
And I 
long for the touch of a 
hand on my brow, 
For a 
dimpled one round my neck thrown, 
While the hours wanders by so wearisome now, 
Far away from my dear little home. 
I've a 
dear little home, ikx 
At the close of the day in the twilight so sweet, 
I 
wander again to the door, 
Where the loving ones over and over repeat, 
Their welcoming to me once more, 
As I 
sit by the fire with the children around, 
I 
think of the many that roam; 
No tAtace for a 
shelter, no bed but the ground, 
o 
dear little home like my own. 
I've a 
dear little bone. 
Merry Moke. 
Sung with great success by S. S. PErrrr throughout the United States. 
There's a

This merry little, funny little joker, 
He is such a

He would laugh all day, and at night he'd play, 
And he'd laugh with his ha, ha, ha. 
With his ha, ha, &c. 
At night when he'd go to his bed, bed, bed, 
On his pillow he'd lay his heal], head, head. 
He'd laugh himself to sleep every night in the week, 
And he'd wake with his haw, haw, haw.

Ohl we've parted from each other, 
And our dream of love is o'er, 
That bright dream was too beautiful to last• 
And we'll meet as only strangers, 
In the future evermore, 
Our once tender love is buried in tn.# past. 
Tho' I've tried to bear the blow, 
Without sighs or bitter tears, 
And tried to smile when my heart ached with pain. 
Yet the burning tears would tall, 
In spite of all that I 
could do, 
For the darling one I 
ne'er shall see again. 
CHORUS. 
My dream of love is o'er, 
I 
try to smile when my heart aches with pain; 
But the memory of the past comes up before 
Me like a 
dream, for the darling one I 
ne'er shall sti-
again. 
Oh! they say you love another, 
Who has claimed you for his bride, 
And you wish me to forgive and to forget; 
All the vows we pledged together, 
By the rippling of the tide, 
As I 
looked into your beauteous eyes—my pet. 
Ahl the heart is like the tides, 
That flow and ebb at will, 
would not cease to love thee if I 
could; 
thro' all the future years, 
I'll love thee fondly, dearly, darling! 
For I 
could not cease to love thee if I 
would.

ftecitation written by JOE Doysmx and recited with tremeadous 
success by him at the Park Theatre, Brooklyn. 
- :o:— 
One pleasant morning for recreation, 
And in meditation for to spend the day, 
With a 
congregation of my own relations, 
I 
went meandering adown Broadway. 
Like ladies shopping, each bar we would stop in, 
For to take a 
drop in for to make us gay, 
,70 When a 
policeman nabbed me, and as he grabbed me, 
He says, old man youv'e been led astray. 
With great vexation and botheration, 
Me to the station he then dragged along, 
With consternation and indignation, 
I 
was the sole attraction of all the throng, 
But I 
wasn't long getting to where the judge was sitting, 
And he looked over at me in a 
serious way, 
Irara, says I 
don't mind me, but by gob he tined me, 
And says he old man, you have been led astray. 
Then with humiliation and botheration, 
To my habitation, I 
then took my way, 
And with great vexation as to what narration, 
Would drive the anger of my wife away, 
I 
met her standing upon the landing, 
And the broom a 
handling in a 
threatning way, 
With a 
profound ovation upon dissipation, 
Says I, stop it darling, you have been led astray. 
Then I 
felt a 
pushing and I 
heard a 
rushing, 
And a 
great concussion like a 
heavy fall, 
Then madly stumbling and blindly tumbling, 
Bang! I 
went up against the wall. 
I 
looked all over for to discover, 
What tramp or loafet had been used that way, 
It soon was shown me, that down stairs she threw me, 
And I 
knew by gorra, I 
was led astray. 
LITTLE MAGGIE MAY, 
THE spring had come, the flowers in bloom, 
The birds sung out their lay, 
Down by a 
little running brook, 
I 
first saw Maggie May. 
She had a 
roguish jet black eye, 
Was singing all the day; 
And how I 
loved her none can tell, 
My- little Maggie May. 
CHORES. 
My little witching Maggie, 
Maggie singing all the day; 
Oh! how I 
love her, none can tel 
My little Maggie May 
Though years rolled on, yet still I 
loved, 
With heart so light ..nd gay, 
And never will this heart deceive 
My own dear Maggie May. 
When others thought that life was gone, 
And death would take away, 
Still by my side did linger one— 
And that was Maggie May. 
My little witching itc 
May heaven protect me for her sake, 
I 
pray both night and day, 
That I, ere long, may call her mine, 
My own dear Maggie May. 
For she is all the world to me, 
Although I'm far away, 
I 
oft times think of the running brool 
And my little Maggie Nay.

Soon I 
will leave thee, 
My dear German Home, 
In a 
new laud afar oft, 
A 
stranger I'll roam; 
Away from the friends 
Who have loved me so dear. 
But though far away, 
In my heart ever near. 
Citonus. 
My old German Home, 
On the hanks of the Rhine, 
May the sun of prosperity 
On it brightly shine; 
I'm going to leave thee, 
Afar off to roam, 
But I'll never forget 
My old German Home. 
I 
see around me, 
Those friends kind and true, 
Who have loved me since child, 
'Tis hard to leave you; 
Soon I 
will come back 
To this good home once more, 
May prosperity attend you, 
As in days of yore. 
Life on the Mississippi. 
Sung by H INES and BLOSSOM. 
Oh good evening to you, one and all, 
We have just come out to sing a 
little ditty, 
It's about the times that's past and gone, 
When we used to work on the grand old Mississippi. 
The passengers they used to wink, 
And look at us so sly, 
Because we'd dance and do our breaks, 
And throw our feet so high. 
But when we get through our little ditty, 
We'll go back again to the grand old Mississippi. 
(Repeat last two lines.) 
Now, white folks, we can no longer stay, 
Or the folks at home will think we've run away. 
But the next time we visit your great city 
We hope you won't forget our little ditty. 
Our old massa was as good a 
man 
As ever you did see ; 
He used to feed us on hoe cake, 
And sometimes hominy. 
Now when we n
-et done our little ditty, 
We'll go back agin to the grand old Mississippi. 
(Repeat last two lines.)

Written by N ED OLIVER, and sung by J. F. 
FIELDS. 
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, 
I'm glad to see you all; 
I 
was just a 
passing by this way, 
I 
thought I'd give you a 
call, 
To tell you how the darkies 
Used to frolic one and all, 
In that little cabin home in South Caroline. 
CHORUS. 
Don't talk of 'mancipation proclamation unto me; 
I 
was happier in slavery then I've been since I've been free. 
Oh ! we war so jolly, we war as happy as could be 
In that little cabin home in South Caroline. 
We used to get up in the morn, 
Before the break of day, 
And go off singing to our work 
In the cotton fields away. 
And when night came we'd sing and dance 
And on the banjo play, 
In that little cabin home in South Caroline. 
CHORUS. 
But these happy days are past and gone many years ago, 
My eyes are growing weak and dim, my steps are getting slow, 
And the time am drawing nearer now in which I'll have to go 
From that little cabin home in South Caroline. 
The Order of Old Bums, 
Written by Jerry Cohan and sung with great success by 
Billy Carter. 
The secret order of old bums, for gall will take the cake, 
They recognize the pass word, it's " What'll you have to 
take ?" 
We likes to drink, we likes to eat, and don't waste drops 
or crumbs, 
Cops and rounders all are on to the order of old bums. 
CHORUS. 
The first degree—charge it to me—then your eye you 
wink, 
The bottle tip, the glass you grip—password—What d 
ye 
drink ? 
For the back of your neck and the seat of your pants, 
The landlord gently comes, 
And lands you on the sidewalk in the order of old bums. 
When the little cop is staying, in some door way for a 
snooze. 
The " Bums" are on the war-path laying, 
For a 
lunch, a 
grasshopper, or booze, booze, booze. 
The watermelon season for a 
change will sometimes suit, 
And when we can't get soft shell crabs why then we'll 
tackle fruit. 
We work the bar for all it's worth till the landlord for us 
comes, 
We furnish politicians from the order of old bums. 
FIRST DEGREE SET TO. 
In the spring time and the summer, 
To the green fields and hen roosts off we goes, 
muBut in the winter the poor bummer, 
Must hustle in the jail for feed and clothes. I 
suppose. 
SECOND DEGREE SET TO. 
The object of this order is to walk when we can't ride, 
And fill ourselves with lager from the empty keg outside, 
We smoke the best Havana buts, and share 'em with our 
chums. 
And an unprotected clothesline is a Christmas for the 
bums. 
THIRD DEGREE SET TO. 
At election time it is our oyster— 
To the polls we gently, gently stray, 
And of schooners the burn is then a 
holster, 
As he samples with the keg election day. 
What d'ye say.

Glides little Maggie Ann.
