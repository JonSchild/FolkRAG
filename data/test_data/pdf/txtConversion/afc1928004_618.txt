SAM LUCAS. 
The subject of our sketch was born in Washington, 
Fayette County, Ohio, August 7, 1848, of poor but 
colored parents, who were formerly slaves, belonging 
to 
Samuel 
Cockerel!, 
Esq., ltionaney, 
Hampshire 
County, Va., arid for whom Sam was named. 
Suc-
cessfully passing the numerous vicissitudes usually at-
tendant upon early childhood, Sam was eventually 
placed in school where he remained for five years, and 
from which he graduated to become a 
farm hand, the 
irksome duties of which he performed till he was nine-
teen years old. 
Ile then went to Cincinnati, and entered 
a 
barber's shop, where he became a 
successful " Knight 
of the Razor." 
His early taste for music here had 
the first chance to develop itself in a 
public manner 
lie was connected with Hamilton's celebrated colored 
Quadrille Band as guitarist and caller, and, during the 
two years or more he was with them lie created quite 
a 
sensation. 
In the latter part of 1869 he went to 
New Orleans and taught a 
colored school a 
few 
months, the confinement of which proved disastrous to 
his health and unsuited to his roving propensities. 
Accordingly he went to St. Louis, Mo., where he 
4 
made his first appearance as a 
minstrel performer 
on any stage, 
with 
Lew. 
Johnson's 
Plantation 
Minstrels, as middle man and balladist; but here 
his growing popularity was remorselessly nipped in 
the bud by 
the company's only existing 
three 
short weeks, thus leaving Sam " out in the cold" 
when he had just begun to find out where he be-
longed; but he was not dismayed, not in the least, 
and satisfying himself that the show business was his 
element, he immediately returned to New Orleans and 
joined Jake Hamilton's Minstrel Company as a 
gen-
eral performer, where he made a 
big hit in his original 
act of Hungry Jake. 
In 1871 he returned to St. 
Louis and again joined the Lew. Johnson's party. 
This time they continued in operation for about one 
year, when Sam returned to his " Razors and Lather 
and Shave'em" at "Johnson's Parlor" on Fifth 
Street. 
Doubtless many who read this recollect the 
location. 
In a 
short time he received a 
letter from 
Mr. Charles Callender, the popular proprietor of the 
" 
Orignal Georgia Minstrels," offering him an engage-
ment which Sam could not resist, so dropping his " ton-
sorial 
togs," he started for Leavenworth, Kansas, 
and July 4 , 
1873, became a 
member of " Callender's 
Original Georgia Minstrels" as a 
ballad singer and 
and general business performer. 
His first act that 
gained any prominence was "The Vegetable Peddler," 
which made a 
big hit. 
In due season the troupe ar-
rived in New York, an0 so great had been their suc-
cess through the West and South, that others began to 
1"
44-
A 
form similar companies under the " Georgia Minstrel" 
head, and Charlie White, who had a 
troupe nearly or-
ganized, secured Bob Hight from Callender, thus leav-
ing a 
vacancy on the end which Sam was called to fill, 
and how acceptably, till the spring of 1875, we leave 
the thousands who have seen him in every State of the 
Union to tell. 
He is now secured by the Redpath 
Lyceum Bureau, to travel with the celebrated Hyer 
Sisters Dramatic Company, in their specialty and 
great moral drama," Out of Bondage," and to-day Sam 
Lucas is considered to be the best colored performer 
in his special line of business in the world. 
His acts ana 
character songs, are nearly all of them entirely original, 
and are gaining for him a 
world wide reputation. 
Among the principal ones may be mentioned, Hungry 
Jake, Slim Jim, Vegetable Peddler, 
Uncle Jasper's 
Home, Daffney (the original), Shivering and Shaking, 
Gwine in de Valley, Hannah bile dat cabbage down,

OLD UNCLE JASPER, 
I 
was born in ole Virginny where the fields of cotton grow, 
And de sugar-cane de sweetest in the land, 
And de possum and de coon, city was always fat and good, 
And when de boys would kotelt him dey feel grand. 
I 
hab trabbled o'er de land, many times my heart's been sad, 
But I'se tried to make de most of de good ole times I'se 
had, 
For de years are going fast, and I 
can't much longer roam, 
And so ole Uncle Jasper's going home. 
C11011IIS. 
Den get up early in de morn, I'se comin', comin', 
Ring de bell and blow de horn, and let me hear de banjo 
play, 
Den get up early in de morn, I'se comin', comin,' 
Ring de bell and blow de horn, and let me hear de banjo 
play. 
When de war was done and gone, den I 
left my cabin home, 
And I 
trabbled thro' de north and thro' de west. 
But of all de lands I'se seen, and of all the place I'se been, 
I 
like de land of sugar-cane de best. 
In de north it am so cold, dat de water freeze up hill, 
And it makes de ole man shake, let him do whate'er ho 
will, 
But de good old sunny south, where de orange blossoms 
grow, 
I 
lub dat good old home, soon back Pll go. 
Chorus.—Den get up early in de morn, dcc. 
Now good people one and all, I 
shall have to say good bye, 
For de heart is sighing for de friends of yore, 
And de older dat I 
grows, will de heart turn back de more 
To childhood's home on ole Virginny's shore.

EMANCIPATION DAY" 
White folks hold your bref while I

Dis old man now is free, in dis land of liberty, 
Uncle Pete is goin' to be a

You know dis wool am getting berry gray;

For I've lived to see emancipation day. 
Before the law was passed every thing was going wrong, 
Railroad stock was only taken at par; 
De darkey now am free in dis land of liberty, 
At de ' lection day you'll find de darkeys dar. 
Chorus.—White folks hold your bref, & c. 
But now we all am free in this land of liberty, 
Father Ab'ram he said it should be done; 
He said we should be free in this land of liberty, 
And his name will ever live with Washington.

GRANDFATIIER'S CLOCK. 
My grandfather's clock was too large for the shelf, 
So it stood ninety years on the floor; 
it was taller by half than the old man himself, 
Though it weighed not a 
pennyweight more. 
It was bought on the morn of the day he was born, 
And was always his treasure and pride, 
But it stopp'd short—never to go again 
When the old man died. 
CHORUS. 
Ninety years without slumbering, tick, tick, tick, deg, 
his life seconds numbering, tick, tick, tick, tick, 
It stopp'd short—never to go again— 
When the old man died. 
In watching its pendulum swing to and fro 
Many hours had be spent while a 
boy; 
And in childhood and manhood the clock seemed to Itti+w • 
And to share both his grief and his joy. 
For it struck twenty-four when he entered at the door, 
With a 
blooming and beautiful bride; 
But it stopp'd short—never to go again 
When the old man died. 
Chorus.—Ninety years without slumbering, & c. 
My grandfather said that of those he could hire, 
Not a 
servant so faithful he found; 
For it wasted no time; and had but one desire, 
At the close of each week to be wound. 
And it kept in its place, not a 
frown upon its face, 
And its hands never hung by its side; 
But it stopp'd short—never to go again— 
When the old man died. 
Chorus.—Ninety years without slumbering, & c.

It rang an alarm in the dead of the night, 
An alarm that for years had been dumb; 
And we knew that his spirit was pluming for flight, 
That his hour of departure had come. 
Still the clock kept the time with a 
soft and muffled chime, 
As we silently stood by his side, 
But it stopp'd short—never to go again— 
When the old man died. 
Chorus.—Ninety years without slumbering, & c.

THE DEAR OLD HOME WE LOVED SC 
WELL.* 
The dear old home we loved so well, 
Tho' but a 
hut down in the dell, 
Fond meary brings us back to dwell 
In that old home we loved so well. 
To this same home our fathers come, 
When daylight and their work is done; 
The children playing on the green, 
Ne'er thought a 
land had brighter scenes 
CHORUS. 
That dear old home we loved so well, 
Fond mem'ry brings us back to dwell; 
Tho' not one stone now marks the spot, 
We'll not forget that humble cot. 
How sweet the orange blossoms bloom 
Around that humble cottage home; 
Ala! how changed all things have come, 
Since we went forth the woods to roam. 
The mocking bird now sings no more, 
Around our humble cottage door. 
'rho' not one stone now marks the spot, 
I'll not forget that dear old cot. - 
Chorus.—That dear old home, &c. 
Good-bye, old home, thy charm has fled, 
I 
bid farewell to soil and sod; 
The only tie left is the dead, 
And those I 
leave in trust with God. 
My children they are scattered now, 
Since freedom brought to them its boon; 
But I 
am old and feeble now, 
My freedom lies beyond the tomb,

SHIVERING AND SHAKING OUT IN TH14: 
COLD.* 
Gazing on gentlemen's mansions of splendor, 
Filled with sweet perfume and shining with gold, 
The thought often strikes me, do great ones remember, 
Those who are shivering out in the cold. 
CHORUS. 
Hungry, dejected and unprotected, 
Houseless and homeless, sad to behold, 
Eyes red with crying, careworn and sighing, 
Shivering and shaking out in the cold. 
What has he ever done to be neglected? 
Why do they thrust him away from the door? 
Perhaps he one time was highly respected, 
The answer is simply because he was poor. 
Chorus.—Hungry, dejected, & c. 
No one will soothe his sad heart of sorrow, 
No one will pity his story old, 
No one will ask if he liveth to-morrow, 
Shivering and shaking out in the cold. 
Chorus.—Hungry, dejected, 6re. 
What is that object I 
see before me? 
Comes from the poor house, fun'ral I'm told, 
Bearing some poor wretch whom death now has set fret, 
He'll no more be shivering out in the cold. 
Chorus.—Hungry, dejected, & c.

Oh, the old home ain't what it used to be, 
The banjo and fiddle has gone, 
And no more you hear the darkies singing,

But this change makes him sad and forlorn' 
For no more we hear the darkies singing

But night bro't its pleasures and rest, 
In the old house down by the river's side, 
The place of all the world the best; 
Oh, where are the children that once used to play 
In the lane by the old cabin door? 
They are scattered now, and o'er the world they roam, 
The old mail ne'er will see them more. 
Chorus.—No, the old home, & c. 
The old man would have rather lived and died 
La the home where his children were born, 
But when freedom came to the colored man, 
He left the cotton field and corn;

And he'll soon have to lay down and die, 
Yet he hopes he will go to a 
better land, 
So now, old cabin home, good-bye.

WEEPING FOR LOST ONES.* 
San and lonely are the hours to-day, 
When mourning hearts in sorrow bide; 
Joy and comfort now are flown away, 
The weary hours in darkness glide. 
No more we'll clasp the loving hand, 
No more the loving smile we'll greet, 
Grief and pity rule the stricken land, 
And mournful worls our lips repeat. 
CHORUS. 
Weeping sad4y, 
For the homes bereft to-day, 
See the many bitter tears now fall 
For those who sleep beneath the clay. 
Tears of pity for the fond and true 
That leave us here so sad and drear, 
Sweet their sleep beneath the flowers and dew. 
While sad and lone we wander here. 
We toll the knell of sad despair, 
And think upon the homes of pain; 
Tears of sorrow now are falling there 
For those who ne'er will come again. 
Chorus.—Weeping sadly, & c. 
Gone, in all the bloom and pride of life, 
Oh, sad the hearts we leave behind; 
Gone, and left us in the weary strife, 
The fair, the loving true and kind. 
In homes of sorrow and distress, 
Oh, may the light of heaven shine, 
Peace and comfort now the weary bless, 
And hush the hearts that now repine.

Tiny feet that travelled lightly 
In this weary world of woe, 
Now silent lie in yonder church-yard,

Gliding by our cottage door,

By the golden river's shore, 
And my heart it yearns with sadness, 
When I 
pass that cottage door. 
Sweetly now the angels carol, 
Tidings from our loved ones far, 
That she still does hover O'er us, 
And will be our guiding star. 
She sleeps the sleep that knows no waking, 
By the golden river's shore, 
And my heart it yearns with sadness, 
When I 
pass that cottage door.

His necktie is of golden hue, 
This most exquisite fellah, 
He looks just like a 
Christmas toy, 
Underneath his silk umbrella; 
His boots are patent leather, 
His bills he never pays; 
He always drinks plain soda, 
And this is what he says: 
CHORUS. 
"u 
revoir, bye, bye!" you should hear him say, 
" 
I'll buy some gingerdrops for Camille across the way!" 
The ladies all together are sighing for a 
beau, 
Of course the individu al is Hildebrandt Montrose. 
He parts his hair with wondrous care, 
And chalks his paper collars; 
His Pa is very wealthy, yes, 
He is worth a 
million dollars 
In " Big Bonanza" mining stock! 
His voice is quite soprano, 
You should hear him sing " Love's Chidings ; 
To a 
Fogarty piano.

I'm the gayest girl in town, 
That's what the people say, 
Because I 
laugh and sing, 
To drive dull care away. 
Old ladies shake their heads, 
And on the sly they say, 
" 
She'll come to no good end, 
For she is much too gay." 
CHORUS. 
Drive, hoop, fence, dance, use the bow, the spear, 
the lance, the lance, 
I'm the gayest girl in town, my home is o'er the way, 
The village people here, all call me flyaway, 
I'm always full of fun, of wrong no one can say, 
My heart is light and free, I'm Rollicking Dollie Day. 
Sometimes alone I 
walk 
Upon the village green, 
To hear the people talk, 
And see what can be seen. 
And if I 
chance to meet 
Some cavalier so gay, 
It's sure to go the rounds, 
"He's sweet on Dollie Day." 
Chorus.—Drive hoop, fence, dance, & c. 
Though Rollicking Dollie Day, 
I'm always just the same, 
I 
laugh and chat with all, 
Pray tell me N
. 
vhere's the blame? 
Perhaps some nice young man, 
That's got a 
winning way, 
May ask to change my name 
From Rollicking Dollie Day. 
Chorus.—Drive hoop, fence, dance, & e.

HOMELESS TO—NIGHT.* 
Lone and weary thro' the streets we wandei, 
For we have no place to lay our heads, 
Not a 
friend on earth is left to shelter us, 
For both our parents now are dead. 
Poor mother died when we were both young, 
Yet father made for us a 
bony:, 
But now he's killed by falling timbers, 
And we are left here all alone. 
CHORUS. 
Lone and weary thro' the stree'n we wander, 
For we have no place to lay 9ur heads; 
Not a 
friend on earth is left to shelter us, 
For both our parents now are dead. 
Who will pity us, and who 'wi1 give us shelter, 
Thro' this sad and lonely right? 
Little brother now is cold an I 
hungry, 
And the tears roll down his cheeks so white. 
Oh, if our mother now wan left us, 
Then she would care for us to-night, 
But ah! the angels they have borne her 
Unto a 
home where a'l is bright. 
Chorus.—Lone and weary thro' the streets, & c. 
Come, good angels, take us to that bright world, 
Where our parents now have gone to dwell, 
Where the cruel flames will never reach us, 
And the orphar has no woes to tell. 
For oh, our ro.ot her oft did tell us, 
When she was with us here on earth, 
That G-od wnuld wipe away all sorrows 
That did not have in sin their birth. 
Chorus.—Lone and weary thro' the streets, & c.

SILVER BELLS OF MEMORY.* 
In the hush of eventide, 
Sitting by my cottage door, 
Fancy softly seems to glide, 
Backward to the days of yore, 
And I've heard in changeful swells, 
Sweetest tones of melody, 
'Tis the sound of silver bells, 
Silver bells of memory. 
CHORUS. 
Silver bells, silver bells, 
Silver bells of memory, 
Silver bells, silver bells, 
Silver bells of memory. 
Many faces have grown old, 
Many forms been laid to rest, 
Underneath the churchyard mould, 
Ones I 
loved the most and best, 
Since I've heard the distant swells, 
Floating on the winds to me, 
Low and sweet the silver bells, 
Silver bells of memory. 
Chorus.—Silver bells, silver bells, & c. 
Now, I 
seem to live once more, 
All the dear delightful past, 
E'er the shadows long before, 
Sunny skies had overcast, 
When we wandered in the dells. 
Linger'd in the flow'ry lea, 
List'ning to the silver bells, 
Now the bells of memory. 
Chorus.—Silver bells, silver bells, dm.

YOU NEVER MISS THE WATER TILL THE 
WELL RUNS DRY.* 
When a 
child I 
lived in Boston, 
With my parents at the farm, 
The lessons that my mother taught, 
To me were quite a 
charm, 
She would often take me on her knee 
When tired of childish play, 
And as she pressed me to her breast, 
I've heard my mother say: 
CHORUS. 
Waste not, want not, 
Is a 
maxim I 
would teach 
Let your watch-word be despatch. 
And practice what you preach 
Do not let your chances, 
Like sunbeams pass you by, 
or you'll never miss the water, 
Till the well runs dry. 
As years roll'd on I 
grew to be, 
A 
mischief making boy, 
Destruction seem'd my only sport, 
It was my only joy, 
And well do I 
remember, 
'When oft times well chastised, 
flow father sat beside me then, 
And thus had me advised:

When I 
arriv'd at manhood, 
I 
etabark'ed in public life, 
And found it was a 
rugged road, 
Bestrewn with care and strife, 
I 
spe culated foolishly, 
My losses were severe, 
But still a 
tiny little voice, 
Kept whisp'ring in my ear: 
Chorus.—Waste not, want not, &c. 
Then I 
studied strict economy, 
And found to my surprise, 
My funds instead of sinking, 
Very quickly then did rise, 
I 
grasp'd each chance and always struck, 
The iron while ' twas hot, 
I 
seiz'd my opportunities, 
And never once forgot: 
Chorus.—Waste not, want not, & c. 
Fm married now and happy, 
I've a 
careful little wife, 
"We live in peace and harmony, 
Devoid of care and strife, 
Fortune smiles upon us, 
We have little children three, 
The lesson that I 
teach them, 
As they prattle round my knee:

BEHIND THE SCENES.* 
When but a 
little boy, oh it really was my joy 
To visit the Theatre I'll admit, 
How happy I 
could be, the performances to see, 
Male seated in the gallery or pit. 
I 
fancied all was real that the curtain did reveal, 
But since that I 
have pass'd beyond my teens, 
I 
begin to understand tho' in front it may look grand, 
'Tis very diff'rent just " behind the scenes." 
So if you will attend for a 
moment now my friends, 
I'll do the best within my humble means, 
To show to you to-night, tho' in front it may look bright., 
'Tis very diff'rent just " behind the scenes." 
The Comedian is one, who, while causing lots of fun, 
his heart may yet hang heavy in his breast, 
And the man who plays the King, though it seems a 
cud-
ous thing, 
In private may be very poorly drest, 
The Ladies, too, so fair, who go floating through the air. 
And look like little Angels there instead, 
Sometimes have to roam unto a 
wretched home, 
And oftentimes go supperless to bed-; 
While those who play the parts of the men with stony 
hearts, 
And look as if their tempers were like fiends, 
Could you see them when away, you'd very likely say, 
They're the mildest looking men " behind the scenes." 
"Cis just the same in life, for what lots of care and ad!. 
And suffering some folks will undergo. 
Just to cut a 
shine and to make themselves look fine, 
And think of nothing else but outside show; 
'Published in sheet form by White, Smith & Co., price 30 cents 
45 
They fancy and suppose that those who wear good clothes, 
Always look the richest and the best; 
But an honest heart and mind is respected most you'd find, 
No matter whether poor or richly drest. 
Still many one you know have caused themselves much woe 
Through trying hard to live beyond their means, 
And though they wear a 
smile, yet really all the while 
They are very wretched just " behind the scenes." 
There's many a 
married pair, I've no doubt you are aware, 
Who in public are so tender and so kind. 
But could you only see them home in privacy, 
A 
very different state of things you'd find. 
Sometimes it is the wife who's the cause of all the strife; 
Sometimes it is the husband who's to blame. 
Let that be how it may who causes all the fray, 
Their quarrelling continues just the same. 
Yet still they try to hide, from all the world outside, 
The snarls and jars with which their household teems, 
And often when you hear them call each other dear, 
They hate each other, just " behind the scenes." 
The wealthy and the great, who can ride about in state, 
And have a 
host of wealth at their command, 
Have, you may be sure, as many troubles to endure 
As those who are the humblest in the land! 
For England's greatest Sage, says all the world's a 
stage, 
And each of us endeavor all our might 
Our follies to conceal, and only to reveal 
That which is most pleasing to the sight. 
No matter where you go, from the highest to the low, 
From Peasantry right up to Kings and Queens, 
Whatever they enjoy there's something to annoy, 
If we could only see " behind the scenes." 
BARNEY. 
Maggie, darling, now good-bye, 
To America I 
go, 
'Twill nearly break my heart to leave you 
And still I 
cannot live here so, 
'Twill nearly break my heart to leave you, 
Yet I 
must from oh! Ireland go. 
The old folks they are growing gray, Maggie, 
The farm it won't support us all, 
I 
cannot stay and see them suffer, 
So I 
must go where duty calls. 
CHORUS. 
BOTH. 
Maggie, ( Barney) dear, Maggie ( Barney) dear, 
Oh, should I 
never see thee more, 
My fondest hope is that you'll love me, 
When I ( you) have left old Ireland's shore.. 
I 
only fear for you, my darling, 
For I 
shall love you more and more. 
ISIA.uoiE. 
Barney, what will come of me, 
When you're gone far o'er the main? 
The birds will only sing in sadness, 
The sun will ne'er shine bright again, 
The birds will only sing in sadness 
Till Barney comes back home again. 
BARNEY. 
Oh, Maggie, Barney feels ' tis hard to part, 
To leave his home and country too, 
But times are getting hard here, Maggie, 
And I 
must now find work to do. 
Chorus.—Maggie ( Barney), dear, &c. 
BARNEY. 
Maggie, do not shed one tear, 
Barney's heart to you is true, 
Published in sheet form by White, Smith & Co., price 4o cent& 
And when he finds some work to do, 
He'll send to Ireland's shore for you, 
Now Maggie shed no bitter tears, 
For Barney's heart is true to you, 
Now Maggie, go and cheer my poor old folks, 
And don't let want e'er cross their door. 
And with God's help I'll work and strive hard 
To make a 
home on freedom's shore. 
Chorus.—Maggie ( Barney), dear, & c. 
ktAGGIE. 
Barney, let me go with you 
To America's bright shore, 
I'd rather die than live here, Barney, 
When you have left our native shore, 
I'd rather die than live here, Barney, 
When you have left old Ireland's shore. 
The old folks ne'er shall come to want, Barney, 
We'll help them as we've done before, 
And with God's help we'll work and strive hard 
To make a 
home on freedom's shore.

OH, THE PEANUTS.* 
'Twas a 
jolly day in June, and all was so gay, 
When I 
took my Lottie out to ride along the Brighton 
way, 
And as we rolled along, behind our fancy bay, 
We cracked in fun the peanuts crisp, and threw the shelLs 
away. 
Happy, happy day, as we jogged along together, 
Talking, talking all the way, of the roses and the weather; 
Till at last the peanuts gone, I 
dared my heart to say, 
" 
Will you crack with me the nuts of life and throw the 
shells away?" 
CHORUS. 
Oh, the peanuts crisp we'll crack and crack, we'll crack 
and crack for aye, 
For Lottie she now rides with me for life's long day, 
So mind we not the road, be rough or smooth it. may, 
We crack our peanuts, wife and I, and throw the shells 
away! 
So when the skies are fair, and Lottie's all so gay, 
We always take a 
little trot along the Brighton way, 
And as we roll along behind our fancy bay, 
We laugh and crack our peanuts still, and throw the 
shells away. 
Happy day, happy day, 'when we thus ride together, 
Talking, talking, all the way of the roses and the weather; 
Or should my heart be blue, ray Lottie'll always say, 
" 
Let's crack the nuts, enjoy the meats, and throw the 
shells away!" 
Chorus.—Oh, the peanuts crisp, ..tc.
