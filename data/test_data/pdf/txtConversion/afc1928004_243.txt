LONE and weary thro' the streets we wander, 
For we have no place to lay our heads, 
Not a 
friend on earth is left to shelter us, 
Eor both our parents now are dead. 
Poor mother died when we were both young, 
Yet father made for us a 
home, 
But now he's killed by falling timbers, 
And we are left here all alone! 
CHORUS . 
Lone and weary thro' the streets we wander, 
For we have no place to lay our heads; 
Not a 
friend on earth is left to shelter us, 
For both our parents now are dead! 
Who will pity us, and who will give us shelter, 
Thro' this sad and lonely night ? 
Little brother now is cold and hungry, 
And the tears roll down his cheeks so white ; 
Oh, if our mother now was left us, 
Then she would care for us to- night ; 
But ah! the angels they have borne her 
Unto a 
home where all is bright. 
Lone and weary, eh.. 
Come, good angel, take us to that bright world, 
Where our parents now have ft one to dwell, 
Where the cruel flames will never reach us, 
And the orphan has no woes to tell; 
For oh, our mother oft did tell us, 
When she was with us here on earth, 
That God would wipe away all sorrows 
That did not have in sin their birth. 
Lone and weary, etc. ,

SHE WAS A SERIO-COMIC SINGER. 
W ritten by GEORGE HERBERT. 
The other evening for a 
walk, 
Thro' Charing Cross I 
strayed, 
And just to pass the time away, 
Went into the Lowther Arcade. 
I 
shall ne'er forget the funny things 
That I 
saw there lor sale, 
'Twas there 1 
met a 
charming girl 
And she wore a 
bright green veil. 
0110RUS.—She was a 
serio-conic singer 
From the West- end Music Hall, 
And she quite took this heart by storm 
With her pretty green Parasol. 
As she passed me by I 
heaved a 
sigh, 
She gave a 
knowing wink, 
So I 
offered her my arm and asked 
If she with me would drink ? 
She paused and then replied " yes, sir, 
I'll have some ice cream soda," 
Then into Gatti's we went, 
And my love I 
quickly told her. 
Spoken.—Yes, and in return she told me it was the same with 
her, as it was with me, love at first sight, but she let me know 
more than she intended I 
could see, and that was, she was going 
to open at " Deacon's 
the next evening, as 
A 
serio-comic singer, itc. 
Next night, my boys, of course I 
went 
Into Deacon's Music Hall, 
And there I 
saw and heard my love 
As she did loudly bawl, 
But judge of my surprise, 
When a 
fellow rushed on too, 
I 
rushed out of the Music Hall, my friends, 
Not knowing what to do. 
Spoken.—Yes, at first I 
intended throwing myself down a 
plug 
hole and drowning myself, upon second thoughts I 
rushed back 
to the chairman and asked him what he knew of her ? he said 
he knew she was lately married to a " Pro," and that she now 
duetist, but before— 
She was a 
serio-comic, & c. 
But now I 
will be off, my friends, 
A broken hearted card, 
For all my hopes are blighted. 
And my happiness is marred. 
But I 
never inure will speak, 
To those charming little maids, 
Who try to catch their victims, 
While strolling in Arcades. 
She was a 
serio-cornie, cte.

OUT IN THE COLD. 
By 
SAM BACNALL. 
Gazing on noblemen's mansions of splendour, 
Fill'd with perfume and shining with gold, 
A 
thought often strikes me, do great ones remember 
Those that are shivering out in the cold. 
CIIORUS. 
Hungry, dejected, feet unprotected, 
Houseless, homeless—sad to behold, 
Eyes red with crying, care- worn and sighing, 
Shivering and shaking out in the cold. 
No one to soothe the sad heart of sorrow, 
None to pity—plenty to scold ; 
None will ask if he lives to-morrow, 
Shivering and shaking out in the cold. 
Hungry, (fa& 
What has he done to be so neglected ? 
Why do you thrust him away from the door ? 
Perhaps he was once most highly respected, 
The answer is simply,—because he is poor. 
Hungry, cfrc, 
What is that dark-looking object, before us ? 
A 
funeral, carried from the workhouse I'm told, 
They're taking a 
poor wretch home to his friends, 
They found him last night out in the cold. 
Hungry, &c. 
Friends of the churchyard, none there will scorn him, 
E'en from the best down to the worst ; 
He'll soon be forgotten, no one will mourn him, 
Where he commingles his dust with the dust. 
Hungry, (tc. 
Sad scenes of sorrow, each coining morrow, 
Brings in it's dull stealthy pace day by day; 
Heaping fresh troubles on inan to his horror, 
Till death seals his doom, aud lie passes away. 
Hungry, •fie.

PUT ME IN ItlY LITTLE BED, 
The mriliksic of this song is published by Wurre, SMITH & PERRY, US 300 
Washington Street, Boston, Price 40 cents. 
! 
birdie, I 
am tired now, 
I 
do not care to hear you sing; 
You've sung your happy songs all day, 
Now put your head beneath your wing; 
I'm sleepy, too, as I 
can be— 
And, sister, when my prayer is said, 
want to lay me down to rest, 
So, put me in my little bed. 
CHORUS. 
Come, sister, come kiss me Good-night 
For, I 
my evening prayer have said, 
I'm tired now, and sleepy too, 
Come, put me in my little bed.

sister ! what did mother say, 
When she was called to heaven away ? 
She told me always to be good, 
And never, never go astray ; 
I 
can't forget the day she died— 
She placed her hand upon my head, 
She whispered softly: " Kei p 
my child—" 
And then they told me she was dead! 
Come, sister, & e. 
Dear sister come and hear my prayer, 
Now, ere I 
lay me down to sleep, 
Within my heavenly Father's care, 
While angels brigbt their vigils keep, 
And let me itsk of him above. 
To keep my soul in paths of right— 
Oh ! let me thank him for his love, 
Ere I 
shall Lay my last Good-night. 
Come sister, cize

Washington street, Boston, Price 40 cents. 
In her" litt'e bed" we laid her, 
When the roses lost their bloom, 
And a 
valley-grave we made her, 
Close beside her mother's lonely tomb; 
Little birdie sang his sad notes, 
As her spirit passed away, 
Ere she sought the home of angels, 
In the land of perfect day. 
CHORUS. 
Little birdie sing your sweetest, 
For, darling is an angel now, 
She is free from pain and sorrow, 
With love's star upon her heavenly brow. 
Far top lovely was our darling, 
For this cold and bitter life, 
• 
And although we weep to miss her, 
She is ree horn mortal worldly strife; 
And we dream her angel mother, 
Strokes ag tin her darling's head, 
And, amid angelic music, 
Lays her in hr little bed. 
Little birdie, Ace. 
Little birdie, sing your svieetest, 
Darling is an angel now, 
She is free ftom piin and sorrow, 
'With love's star upon her heavenly brow; 
Happy child and happy mother, 
Reunited ne'er to part, 
In the angel home above us, 
Let this cheer our mournful heart.

WERE SHALL I TAKE MY BRIDE.

Where shall I 
take my bride?

! 
no I Ah! no I It is tunnell'd through 
To the dim and distant glen, 
Away from the haunts of men ? 
Ali no ! 
Ah I

And the shepherds's pipe is silent round, 
Or in the scream of engine drown'd. 
SPOKE'S. (But you shall have music a

The fiddles will go a 
twiddle twiddle dee, 
And the flute will toot a

And the drums will beat a

And the cornets blare pa pa pa pa! pa pa pa pa I 
And the piccolo squeak I 
And the ophicleide howl I 
And the cymbals clash! 
In the home that I

Where shall I

'Neath a 
branching shadow wide? 
Au ! no ! 
Ah I 
no ! 
That would trespass bet 
Gather berries in meadows gay ? 
Ali no, for with our taste they 
Would not, would not in the least agree. 
And ove needs careful feeding, so 
We to a

ALL THAT GLITTERS IS NOT GOLD. 
I.0 this world of care and trouble, 
Where men toil with hand and brain: 
Seeking fame— that airy bubble— 
And not always seek in vain. 
Though the path be strew'd 
itli flowers, 
And the laurels bind his brow, 
All his friends admire his powers, 
lie can do without them now, 
Still he's wasted, worn and weary, 
And he finds he's growing old; 
Remember thou the sage's adage— 
" 
All that glitters is not gold."' 
See the warrior, brave in action, 
Ever ready for the fray! 
Sternly, nobly, scorns all faction, 
And to freedom fights his way. 
How he bears with cold and hunger, 
Houseless, homeless, 'neath the sky, 
Be must march a 
little longer, 
Till he hears the battle cry. 
Then his soul is filled with glory, 
Tho' his friends lie stark and cold, 
Thus ends many a 
hero's story— 
" 
All that glitters is not gold." 
See that great and mighty noble, 
Rolling in his coach of state, 
Surely he has ne'er known trouble, 
His seems such a 
happy fate; 
He has heaps of land and money, 
Lovely wife and children fair, 
What a 
grand ancestral dwelling, 
Surely he has not a 
care ? 
Ask his friends and they -will mutter, 
By his bankers he's been sold, 
And this proves the truth I 
utter, 
‘` All that glitters is not gold."

IN 
THAT'S THE WAY—{CONCLUDED.] 
As Fan was going down Nassau Street, 
That's the way the story goes; 
Another young man she chanced to meet, 
That's the way the story goes; 
He looked so shy and winked his eye, 
To escape his glances Fan did try, 
'Twas all in vain, he gave her a 
pie,— 
That's the way the story goes. 
The pie, it gained the heart of Fan, 
That's the way the story goes; 
The rival of Dan was a 
penny pieman, 
That's the way the story goes. 
Fan gained her father's and mother's consent, 
To get married, and off with the pieman went, 
But since that day she's had cause to repent,— 
That's the way the story goes. 
For coming away from church that day, 
That's the way the story goes ; 
A German band began to play, 
That's the way the story goes; 
And frightened a 
horse in front of a 
car, 
Knocked down and killed the poor pieman, 
And made a 
widow of faithless Fan,— 
That's the way the story goes. 
Now, broken-hearted, about the streets, 
That's the way the story goes; 
Faithless Fan her Dan oft meets, 
That's the way the story goes ; 
He heeds her not, but passes her by; 
All hot! two a 
penny I " she hears him cry; 
" 
And " she's sorry she ever took the pie,— 
That's the way the story goes.

DAYS OF ' 49 IN CALIFORNIA. 
Oh, here you see old Tom Moore, 
A 
relic of former days. 
And a 
bummer too, they call me now— 
But what care I 
for praise? 
For my heart is filled with the days of yore, 
And oft do I 
repine, 
For the days of Old, the days of gold, 
And the days f 
Forty-nine. 
I'd comrades then who loved me well, 
A 
jovial saucy crew ; 
There were some hard cases I 
must confess, 
But still they were brave and true ; 
Who'd never flinch, what'er the pinch, 
Would never fret or whine, 
But like good old bricks, they stood the kicks, 
In the days of Forty-nine. 
There was Kentuck Bill, I 
knew him well, 
A fellow so full of tricks, 
At a 
poker game he was always thar, 
And as heavy too, as bricks ; 
He'd play you draw, he'd ante a 
slug, 
And go a 
hatful blind; 
But in a 
game with Death, Bill lost his breath, 
In the days of Forty-nine. 
There was Monte Pete, I'll n'er forget, 
For the luck that he always had ; 
he'd deal for you both night and day, 
Or as long as you had a 
scad. 
One night a 
pistol laid him out, 
Twas, his last lay out in fine, 
It caught Pete sure, right in the door, 
in the days of Forty-nine. 
I_ 1 
DAYS OF ' 49 IN CALIFORNIA. [CONCLUDED.] 
There was New York Jake, a 
butcher boy, 
So fond of getting tight; 
And whenever Jake got on a 
spree, 
lie was sp'iling for a 
fight. 
One day he ran agin a 
knife, 
In the bands of old Bob Cline, 
So over Jake we held a 
wake, 
In the days of Forty-nine. 
There was Rackensack Jim, who could out-roar 
A buffalo bull—you bet; 
He roared all day, he roared all night, 
And I 
believe he is roaring yet. 
One night he fell in a 
prospect hole— 
Twas a 
roaring bad design— 
For in that hole Jim roared out his soul, 
In the days of Forty-nine. 
There was a 
poor lame Jess, a 
hard old case, 
Who never would repent, 
Jess never missed a 
single meal, 
Nor he never paid a 
cent. 
But poor old Jess, like all the rest, 
Did to death at last resign ; 
For in his bloom, he went up the flume, 
In the days of Forty-nine. 
Of all the comrades I 
had then, 
Not one remains to toast ; 
They have left me here in my misery, 
Like some poor wandering ghost 
And as I 
go from place to place, 
Folks call me a 
traveling sign ; 
Saying, " Here's Tom Moore, a 
hummer, sure, 
01 the days of Forty-nine.'

The fortune's come we've waited for so long— 
Our dad's a

Bub, just take and fling them out the door; 
I'll have the best the market can afford, 
Now da:I's a 
millionaire. 
Hurrah ! hurrah! etc. 
MR. O'LEARY. 
Written and sung by JOHN FIELDING. 
I 
SUPPOSE yes have read of ould Ireland, 
And her dear little shamrock shore, 
Where the boys and the girls are so frisky, 
When smothered in whiskey galore. 
Oh ! musha, but that is the place, 
For fun, for blarney, and wit, 
So if yes will list to my rhymes, 
Be the powers I 
will tip yes a 
bit. 
CHORUS. 
For me name it is Mr. O'Leary, 
' 
Oh! Leary. 
Oh ! Leary, 
Who came from the County Tipperary, 
In the parish of sweet Gotlinahu. 
Our balls and our parties remember, 
All got up in illegant style, 
We have pipes, and tobacco, and whiskey, 
And butter- milk that would make you smile. 
We dance reels, jigs, and cowtillians, 
And break- downs by the score, 
Till the piper gets drunk as the divil, 
And he's taken home on the barn door. 
For me name, etc. 
At our fairs there is fun by the bushel, 
For those who will join in our games, 
At a 
christening there's oftimes the divil, 
In giving the poor child a 
name. 
At a 
wake there's sometimes a 
row, 
The divil a 
word of a 
lie, 
The corpse ofttimes goes to its grave 
With a 
most beautiful, delicious black eye. 
For me name, etc.

When all is lovely, calm and still; 
That welcome hour so dear to me, 
When purest thoughts my bosom fill! 
The bird flies homeward to its nest, 
The zephyr woos the wand'ring bee, 
The dewdrop seeks the lily's breast, 
So evening brings my heart to thee. 
CHORUS.

'Tis evening brings my.heart to the..

To mingle with the orb of day; 
A

Will lose itself in ocean spray; 
And when the sky with beauty glows, 
And starry eyes look on the sea, 
When weary nature seeks repose, 
Then evening brings my heart to thee. 
To thee! to thee, eta. 
Oh! I 
could linger at thy side, 
And dream away my every care; 
Or fancy life a 
silver tide, 
With not a 
wave to ripple there; 
Though fortune frown and coldly spurn, 
And mine a 
chequered path must be, 
Till mem'ry's lamp shall cease to burn, 
Will evening bring my heart to thee. 
To thee! to thee, eta.

As Sung by TONY PASTOR. 
Behold in me a 
pedagogue, 
Who keeps a 
little school ; 
To teach children to read and write, 
Is my never failing rule. 
From morn till night you can hear their tongues, 
In chorus go click, clack; 
And don't they have a

Whene'er I 
turn my back. 
And all day you can hear them say

Tho' always draw it mild ; 
But you know that if you spare the rod, 
You're sure to spoil the child. 
My scholars range from fifteen down 
To those who scarce can speak; 
And for their education, I 
Just charge one bob per week. 
And all day you can hear them say

The parents of my scholars 
Are not wealthy—that you'll know ; 
When I

For months they often owe.

In certain subjects suitable 
To all and every class. 
At one each day, you can hear me say

MARY AND HER LAMB. 
AIE:—" Mabel Waltz." 
From upward of a 
hundred manuscripts sent to the office 
of THE Sus, we select the following versions of the popu-
lar poem which relates the adventures of Mary and her 
lamb, as specimens of public opinion on the subject con-
veyed in metrical form. 
The variety and surprising nature 
of the adventures m which Mary and the lamb— and par-
ticularly the lamb—are involved, indicate a 
considerable 
development of the imaginative faculty among the eon-
tributers. 
These productions are in the sttietest sense pop-
ular poems. 
They emanate from a 
part of the great con-
stituency who read THE SUN, and are the artless, untutored 
utterances of the people. 
As such they will be sure to be 
appreciated. 
In most instances the authors modestly with-
hold their names; but the verses which we print first, in 
point of style and finish and in imaginative power, singu-
larly resemble those choice morceaus, by the H OD. Von 
O'llall with which our metropolitan weeklies are occasion-
ally enriched. 
The envelope enclosing them bore the 
monogram of the Lotus Club, of which the Hon. You. O'H. 
is President. 
Dare we surmise that the poem is from his 
polished pen ? 
Here it is : 
Mary had a 
little lamb 
That couldn't read or write; 
When Mary offered him his hash, 
Her hand he'd always bite. 
Mary took her little lamb 
Round to the butcher's shop ; 
Then Mary's father gave a 
teed 
With lots of mutton chop. 
3Iary had a 
little lamb, 
it jumped down in the well, 
And after Mary pulled it up 
It ran and jumped down again. 
And was drowned. 
Mary had a 
little lamb, 
its eyes were heavenly blue. - 
And if you touch that little lamb 
• 
put a 
head on you." 
And so the teacher turned him out, 
But still he lingered near, 
And w!liu-d pat iontly about, 
• 
Then vaii;ed off on his 
DIARY'S LAMB. (CONTINUED.) 
She put him in his little bed, 
And bade him go to rest. 
"You bet," the little lambkin said, 
"1'11 do my level best." 
Mary had a 
little lamb, 
She gave that lamb THE SUN, 
And when it red the news, it said. 
" 
That's how the whole thing's done. 
Mary had a 
little lamb, 
'Twas the very picture of jollity, 
But it never amounted to much, 
As it had no ancilliary quality. 
Marie hat von liddle scheep, 
Hish void vas piaci:: as ink; 
She dook him out to sehkate von tay, 
Unt tround him in der Rink.

But ven she vake, she vas misdake,

NEW YORK, feb. 1st, 1870, 
mr. editor dear sir ascept this from a 
little girl 8 
years 
old. 
mary had a 
little lamd 
with her it would not go 
she throughed it down a 
flight of stairs 
and how is that for low. 
Mary had a 
little lamb, 
And snow white was its skin, 
But when it followed her to school, 
The boys said, " That's too thin." 
She missed hint from her side; " Alas," 
She said, " my lamb's a 
goner." 
But he was only nibbling grass 
By the Little Church round the Corner. 
Mary had a 
little lamb 
That followed her with fear; 
When Mary stopped to get a 
SUN, 
He " walked off on his ear." 
[2] 
MARY'S LAMB. (CONTINUED.) 
Mary had a 
little lamb, 
That acted very queer, 
For every time she told it to 
'I' would t• walk off on its ear." 
By this, at last, it broke its neck, 
Then up at Mary looked, 
And murmured, as it closed each eye, 
" 
Dear Moll, my mutton's cooked." 
Mary had a 
little lamb. 
It's tail went with a 
jerk, 
So she cut it off behind the ears, 
To " see hows the old thing work." 
Mary had a 
little lamb, 
Its fleece was white as snow, 
And every time it heard a 
ba-a-h, 
It bleated "Not for Joe." 
Mary had a 
little lamb, 
Its wool was black as ink, 
And everywhere that Mary went, 
The lamb went too, I 
think. 
He followed her down town one day, 
Which made Miss Mary swear; 
She caught him by his little neck, 
And pulled him by the hair. 
She made him " walk upon his ear." 
And used him like a 
brute. 
Then ": put a 
head " upon the dear, 
And " bust him in the snoot." 
Mary had a 
little lamb, 
All covered o'er with NV001 3 
He wandered to the Stock Exchange, 
And tried to be a 
Bull. 
The brokers greeted him with joy, 
Approached him with a 
query, 
And offered to give him a 
certain point. 
On a 
few hundred shares of Erie. 
The Bears embraced him with a 
hug, 
And urged him to take a 
risk; 
But he vowed and swore he would'nt go in 
Until he could see Jim Fisk. 
[

MARY '
S LAMB . (CONTINUED.) 
For Jim he went to the Opera House. 
And wagging his tail with a 
jerk. 
Told him about the brokers, and asked, 
" 
How does the old thing work ?" 
But Jim replied in his choicest French 
Prenez garde you dot get soled ; 
Je'ne pane pas Anglais, 
Allez vous trouver Jay Gould. 
The last that was seen of the little lamb 
Was at the corner of Broad and Wall, 
He was going toward tile stock Exchange, 
And never came back at all. 
Mary had a 
little lamb 
As round as any gherkin, 
She took to school the old thing once— 
" 
That's how it was a 
workin." 
It made the children laugh and play 
To see a 
sight so new— 
A 
little boy to Mary cried: 
" 
I'll put a 
head on you." 
The teacher unto Mary said, 
"You cunning little elf, 
Why did you thins ?" and Mary said, 
" 
You know how ' tis yourself?" 
When Mary had to leave the school, 
She cried in a 
sad, sad manner, 
And went to bed, and softly said, 
" 
That's what's the matter with Hannah." 
Mary hat von leetle lamp, 
Dat vas its mistress' bride, 
It lift, oond lift, oond kept on lifting, 
Oond ten it shtoppt—oond died. 
Mary had a 
little lamb, 
He died and was a 
goner, 
She took him to Sabine, 
And he told her to go to the Little Church round the Cor-
ner.

MARY 
S LAMB. (CONTINUED.) 
Mary lost her littuel lam, 
Its fat was fried out in lard ; 
Its fleece made busily bombazine, 
Five quarters to the yard. 
Mary had a 
little lamb, 
It pleased Ulysses S.; 
She sent it on to Washington, 
And now she's Postmistress. 
Mary had a 
little lamb, 
It drank cold water freely, 
And looked so innocently wise, 
She called it Horace Greely. 
" 
Mary had a 
little Lamb," 
I've heard so often said, 
That all I 
know about it is, 
1 
wish that Lamb was dead. 
A contributor to the Virginia (Xev) Enterprise furnishes 
to that paper the following : 
"I cannot help writing poetry, no matter how hard I 
try. 
Legal, medical ttnd theological advice has been taken in 
vain— nothing stops it— it must come. My 
friends have advis-
ed me to persevere, and 1 
mean to do it. 
My 
last (and best) 
effort is as follows ; 
Mary had a 
little lamb, 
They got it very cheap, 
And when it was tired of being a 
lamb, 
It grew up into a 
sheep. 
One day it followed her from home, 
And didn't know what to think 
When it saw the people going around 
Inside the skating rink 
Then the lamb said ; It's very, queer. 
What ever could have got ern ! 
Just then poor Mary tumbled down, 
And bumped her little—head. 
Mary bad a 
little lamb. 
And liked it very much ; 
It pleased her better far than birds, 
Or ducks and geese. and such. 
[5] 
MARY'S LAMB . (CONTINUED.) 
Whenever Mary came from school, 
Her mother quick she sought, 
And gave her not a 
moment's peace 
Until her lamb was brought. 
And everywhere that Mary went 
The lamb was sure to go, 
Because when asked if she'd have more, 
She never answered " No." 
What made dear Mary like the lamb, 
Does any one inquire ? 
Because she knew how good it was, 
When roasted by the fire. 
Aed when served up with good mint-sauce 
And fresh green peas you'll know 
ow ti s 
yourself, and understand 
Why Mary liked it so. 
Mary had a 
little lamb. 
It's fleece was white as snow, 
And anywhere that Mary went, 
That lamb it wouldn't go. 
So Mary took a 
stick, one day, 
And lammed it for a 
spell— 
They had him with green peas next day 
And he went very well. 
Mary had a 
little lamb, 
She laid it on a 
shelf. 
And every time it wagged it's tail, 
"You know how ' tis yourself." 
Mary had a 
little lamb. 
That was all over white, 
She put his hide on every day, 
And to keep it from wearing out too fast 
She took it ofl at night. 
Mary had a 
little lamb, 
That stayed with her at home,

MARY S LAMB. (CONCLUDED.) 
But she broke its wretched little neck, 
Because its wool was so confounded tangled 
That it would not comb. 
Mary had a 
little lamb, 
Left Ireland to its fate, 
That dined at Sweeney's ev'ry day, 
And drank its whisky straight. 
Ulysses had a 
little lamb, 
lie called it St. Domingo— 
Now Sumner he went fierce for it 
knd grabbed it's wool, by Jingo! 
Mary had a 
little lamb 
That never missed its feed— 
It fed and whisked its little tail, 
Upon the Banks of Tweed I 
Mary had a 
little lamb, 
Sung Irish songs unfearin', 
But ev'ry tune had silvery sounds, 
To suit the (S) Harps of Erin. 
Mary had a 
little lamb, 
She sent to Colonel Burke, 
The exile smiled, and feebly said : 
" 
How does the old thing work." 
&try had an Irish lamb, 
From drink. she said, I'll wean ye, 
rite lamb broke lose and joined the crowd, 
You'll find with young DAN SWEENEY. 
Mary had a 
little lamb, 
His name was " Slippery Dick ;" 
But Haveymer—though jolly Green— 
Did beat him every trick.

IT'S FUNNY WHEN YOU FEEL THAT WAY. 
As sung by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
I SHAN'T forget how queer I 
felt when first I 
fell in love, 
I 
had a 
most severe attack through squeezing a 
lady's glove. 
Her lovely hand was in it as I 
danced with her so gay, 
I 
thought myself in paradise—it's funny when you feel that 
way. 
CHORUS, 
I 
felt as tho' I'd tumbled into honey, and some one had left me 
all their money. 
The -feeling's so peculiar and funny, it's funny when you feel 
that way. 
I 
took her down to supper, and sat down by her side, 
I 
helped her to the ices, and filled her glass with pride, 
In fact paid such attention, that she viewed me with dismay, 
I 
moved my chair so close to hers, it's funny when you feel that 
way. 
I 
felt as tho', etc. 
We met again cirke afternoon, and as we were alone, 
I 
plucked up nerve to ask her if some day she'd be my own; 
She blushed and said, go see papa and ask him if I 
may, 
I 
danced the cancan round the room, it's funny when you feel 
that way. 
I 
felt as tho', etc. 
The old man said that we might wed and so be crowned our 
bliss, 
And I 
shall be a 
married man in about a 
month from this. 
It seems as though the time, somehow, would never pass away, 
I 
long to hear those wedding bells, it's funny when you feel 
that way. 
I 
felt as tho', etc.

NEVER FORSAKE THE SHIP. 
Never forsake the ship ! 
Her keel drives on through the heavy sea, 
Like a 
ploughshare cleaving the furrowed lea, 
Tossing Riot t 
bright wreaths of spray, 
Feathery buds of the Ocean's May ! 
Coronals white as the stainless snow 
Shine in the wake of the vessel's prow ; 
Oh, never were blossoms so pure and fair 
As the vapoury jewels glistening there. 
Never desert the ship! 
The land lies yonder— through cloud and foam— 
Ever steer on for our distant home, 
Though the tightened cordage snap in twain, 
And the creaking timbers shiver and strain; 
Though the sluggish sails may droop and fall, 
Like the heavy folds of a 
funeral pall, 
The breeze will awaken, the wind uprise, 
And the brave barque speed under sunny skies. 
Never forsake the ship! 
Hope may wither and courage fail, 
If faith sustains us, no need to quail ; 
Oh, blinded vision— oh, darkened sight. 
Pine through the gloom of the shrouding night; 
Though the longed-for haven be hid from view, 
Believe that a 
home awaiteth you, 
Mariners! pause not to idly deplore 
The rugged path to that promised shore. 
Never give up the ship ! 
By the sunken rock and the shelving strand, 
Guide her still on with a 
firm brave hand, 
Steering away for the chainless sea, 
Her sails all set and her flag flung free, 
So let tus wrestle for freedom or life, 
[11 
7' 
NEVER FORSAKE, &C.—[CONCLUDED. 
Where the hurricane wages a 
generous strife; 
No hidden reef, like a 
treacherous foe, 
Lying in ambush to strike a 
blow. 
33 
Never desert the ship! 
Even though perils be brooding near, 
Turn not aside \\id' the recreant's fear; 
No one can tell when the heavens may lower, 
And the fierce storm burst out in its terrible power, 
Awl the lash of the sea. like a 
slave-driver's whip, 
Fall with its wrath on the beautiful ship ; 
Set her to rights, men, and keep her afloat-
, 
Nor slink in your dread to the life-saving boat. 
Never forsake the ship! 
The masts may be shattered, the white sails be rent, 
And the tapering spars, like a 
reed, may be bent ; • 
Yet cling- to the barque though her timbers may yawn, 
And the rudder you steered by be parted and gone, 
The fast holding anchor be wrenched from the chain, 
And her beam=, from the stem to the stern, riven in 
twain ; 
Flinch not, doomed comrades ! but terror dispel i 
Though her strong oaken rib s be crushed in like 
a 
shell. 
Never desert the ship ! 
Heed not the crash that has sundered the deck, 
Remember your oaths, men, and stand by the wreck; 
The keel's lying upinost. the mainmast below, 
And the sea- weed's dark tangles are wreathed round 
the prow. 
Gird up your souls, there is. glory in death, 
Who Nvould not strive for time martyr's pale wreath ? 
With brow still undaunted and firmly set lip, 
Let a wild cheer ring out, a d 
go down with the 
ship.

I WISH MAMMA WAS HERE. 
The 2tiusic of this Song is published by White & Goullard, 86 Tremont 
Street, Boston, Mass. 
Price 35 cents. 
Sun; with immense applause by TONY I'AsTrut. 
A 
TINY, pretty boy was seen 
To climb his father's knee, 
And kiss his brawny cheek and say, 
"Now papa, you kiss me." 
The father pressed his darling child, 
And smoothed his silken hair, 
And Willie murmured with a 
sigh, 
"I wish mamma was here !" 
I 
wish mamma was here ! 
I 
wish mamma was here!" 
And Willie murmured with a 
sigh, 
" 
I 
wish mamma was here !" 
A 
tear rolled down the father's cheek, 
He pressed his pining boy, 
For her he loved had gone before, 
And Willie's end was nigh; 
He bore him to his little cot, 
And dried the falling tear, 
And Willie murmured in his sleep, 
" 
I 
wish mamma was here !" 
" 
I 
wish mamma," etc. 
His darling pined that very night, 
Until the turn of tide, 
The angel death was near him then, 
At early dawn he died. 
The father cried ill wild despair, 
" 
Oh ! live, my darliner dear !" 
And Willie breathed his last fond sigh, 
"I know mamma is here !" 
"I wish mamma," etc.

I WAS DESPISED BECAUSE I WAS POOR. 
Its 
Farewel, false girls, I 
leave you in sorrow and in pain, 
My absence cannot grieve you, soon you'll bear a 
stranger's name, 
I'm forsaken for another, one with gold in store ; 
Then farewell father and mother, I 
m 
despised for being poor. 
We have lived and loved from childhood, and vowed we ne'er 
would part. 
Passed many hours in the wild wood but she has nearly broke 
my heart, 
There came a 
wealthy stranger, just from a 
foreign shore, 
He woo'd, and soon he gained her from me for I 
was poor. 
When wed the bells were chiming, as the carriage it pass'd by, 
The lads and ! asses smiling but a 
tear bedimn'd her eye, 
Farewell vain girl, the ocean will part us evermore 
I 
lov'd you with devott on, but was scorned for being poor. 
I 
shall never more behold her, nor hear her sweet voice again. 
I've enlisted for a 
soldier, to die on the battle plain; 
May sorrow ne'er distress her, but Lappiness in store, 
And yet loving I 
will bless her, though despised for being poor.

Kind folks T

Her uamo was Sally Bell, 
How she serv'tl this individual, 
Listen, and I

Oh i 
she really was a 
beauty, 
Oh, such a 
charming girl, 
A reglar blue-eyed Venus, 
Was my once 1 
w'd faithless Sal. 
She had such a 
lovely figure, 
And such a 
graceful walk, 
And her tongue it was like honey, 
Whenever she did talk, 
But now she's gone and left me, 
That fair deceitful Sal, 
And I 
lov'd her, oh, better by far 
Than any other gal. 
As we were walking out one day, 
Su happy arm in arm, 
" 
Hero comes my cousin Smith," says oho, 
Now don't feel alarm'd. 
Up came a 
heavy swell with such 
A fearful stock of hair, 
And shook my Sally by the baud, 
And gave a 
wicked leer. 
Says lie, " Dear, how Wye do." 
I 
know I 
then look'd blue, 
But before she spoke I 
said, " Sir," 
What's that to do with you, 
Says I, " this is my Sal. 
And stick to her I 
shall, 
Go and find anot ; er cousin, Sir 
Or any other gal."

Says she, " don't be a

" 
It's all right," said her cousin; 
" 
My dear Sir, take it cool." 
To strike him I 
felt 
But he was so jolly tall, 
And I 
felt at that moment, 
So particularly small. 
" 
This is an o:d acquaintance 
Of mine," says faithless Sal, 
"For you really are too soft for me, 
Or any other gal." 
My ears I 
could scarce believe, 
'T was such a 
fearful shock, 
At such a 
piece of impudence, 
My brain was burning hot.

And when lost to my view, 
I 
thought for a

THE ADVENTURES OF A DRY- GOOD'S CLERK. 
Ara.—" Charcoal Man." 
On, there was a 
young man lived in Harlem town, 
Vermicella was his maiden name; 
And he got tired of living a 
country life, 
And he wasn't very much for to blame; 
So lie emigrated down to this ere town, 
The fountain of all wealth, 
And he measured out tape in a 
dry-goods shop, 
Which wasn't very good for his health. 
Oh, he fell in love with a 
nice young dove, 
Her name it was Johanna, 
And she wore a 
magnolius crinoline, 
And she punished the grand piano; 
And he took her to Coney Island on the ferry boat, 
And fed her on strawberries and cream; 
She was chief engineer of a 
millinery shop, 
And boss of a 
sewing machine. 
There was a 
photographic man lived opposite her house, 
Who tried her cruel heart for to soften, 
And who won her young affections away, 
By taking her pictures for nothing; 
When the dry- goods clerk came to hear of this, 
Out of him it took the shine ; 
So he packed all his goods in a 
cigar box, 
And started up in Donaldson's balloon.

SQUINTY DAN. 
[BANJO SOLO.] 
rn tell you of a 
nice young man, 
And of a 
maiden gal; 
The neighbors called him Squinty Dan, 
And she long-legged Sal. 
They lived down on Centre Street, 
And loved each other well ; 
And it's of a 
dismal history, 
That now Pin going to tell. 
Now Squinty Dan he had red hair, 
And looked two ways for Monday; 
He peddled clams around the street, 
On every day but Sunday. 
But Sunkiays Squinty Dan would go 
r10 court long-legged Sal, 
And take her to ride in his clam-baroucha 
On the banks of Gowanus canal. 
He used to feed her on clam-soup, 
Clain-chowder, and clam- pie, 
And send her lots of long- necked clams, 
For her to roast and fry. 
Till the neighbors' gals, through jealousy, 
Male up a 
horrid plan 
To ireeze the love in the bosom of 
Her darling Squinty Dan, 
When Squity Dan heard the news, 
lie climbed to a 
chimney-top; 
He pulled a 
pound of powder out, 
And down he let it drop. 
It flashed up with a 
fearful roar, 
And blowed him so far on high ; 
He never came down—and that is the last 
Of this mournful his-to-ry.

THE TICKET ON THE SHAWL.----[CoNa.marD.] 
I 
bought the shawl without delay, 
Most girls, you know, like some display; 
That garment I so wished to don, 
So in the shop I 
put it on; 
Of course, I 
felt it no surprise 
To notice every body's eyes 
Attracted by my purchase, no, 
I 
felt quite sure it would be so. 
Oh dear, dm. 
My ears were startled, I 
declare, 
When I 
heard a 
lad cry out, " Look there! 
Why, I 
say, Bill, lor' bless my eyes, 
Don't she know how to advertise ?" 
Then Bill replied, " Well, I must say, 
The lady does look rather gay, 
She really is a 
charmer, Ben, 
And precious cheap at two pounds ten." Oh dear, dra. 
I 
walked as far as Temple Bar, 
When a 
girl said, " Oh, miss, there you are; 
I 
must confess you do look nice, 
tut you shouldn't ticket up the price." 
A 
cabman cried out, " Miss, good luck, 
I 
likes a 
girl woes got good pluck, 
I'll buy you for a 
wife, miss, when 
I 
saves as much as two pounds ten." 
Oh, dear, ko. 
I 
felt a 
kind of strange alarm, 
But a 
gent politely touched my arm, 
Saying, " Let ine your attention call 
To this ticket pinned upon your shawl." 
I 
nearly fell, but he caught my arm, 
And his soothing words had such a 
charm; 
We married, and I 
bless the hour when 
He met me marked up "two pounds ten." 
And now I am a 
happy wife, 
Surrounded by the joys of life, 
I 
often tell of where and when 
He saw nie marked up "two pounds ten."

THE OLD CABIN HOME. 
Words and Music by STEMEN C FOSTER. 
I 
am going far away. 
Far away to leave you now; 
To the Mississippi River I

I

And 
sing this little song— 
Away down in my Old Cabin Home. 
CHORUS. 
Here is my Old Cabin Home; 
Here is my sister and my brother; 
Here lies my wife the joy of my life. 
And my child in the grave with its 10,1

her. 
I 
am going to leave this land, 
With this our darkey band, 
To 
travel all this wide world o'er; 
And when I 
get tit. 
I 
will settle down to rest, 
4ittray down in my Old Cabin Home. 
Here is my Old Cabin Home, ea 
When old age comes on, 
And. my hair is turning gray 
will hang up the banjo all alone, 
sit down by the fire, 
And I'll pass the time away, 
Away down in my Old Cabin Home 
Here is my Old Cabin Home, Zto. 
'Tis there where I 
roam, 
Away down on the old farm, 
Where all the (iarkies am free; 
Ob! merrily sound the banjo 
For the white folks round the room, 
Away down in my Old Cabin Home 
Here is my Old Cabin Home, &o.

THE BUGABOO,, 
As Sung by JERRY BARRINGTON. 
COKE all ye tender-hearted boys, wherever you may be, 
And I'll tell you of the dangers upon the dark blue sea, 
Of the dangers and the hardships, nay boys, that I went 
through,* 
When I 
shipped as cook and steward my boys, on board of the 
Bugaboo. 
*Repeat. 
The day when first I 
joined her she lay in James street canal: 
She was large and stout and beautiful—forget her shape I 
never 
shall : 
The captain wore a 
large straw hat, knee breeches and a 
body 
coat so blue,* 
Arrah, boys, he'd made a 
fine figurehead for to ornament the 
Bugaboo. 
*Repeat. 
We soon weighed anchor and set sail to plough the raging surf, 
We were bound for the bog of Allan to get a 
load of turf. 
We sailed until we passed the back of Richmond barracks so 
true,* 
When the gallant 84th fired a 
royal salute of bricks at the cap-
tain of the Bugaboo. 
*Repeat. 
We sailed three years when a 
storm arose, and the sea ran 
mountain high, 
The thunder rolled, the lightning flashed and lit the dark blue 
sky, 
So the second mate gave orders to lower the sails and clew,* 
While the captain down below was smoking in his bed—he set 
fire to the Bugaboo. 
*Repeat. 
When the captain found what he had done, he loud for help did 
shout, 
He called up through the chimney- top for the helmsman to 
come and put it out; 
But the helmsman was fast asleep, and to his post untrue,* 
And the fire burned so hard through the middle of the turf, 
they couldn't save the Bugaboo. 
*
Repeat. 
When fifteen thOusamil miles from land in latitude fifty-four, 
The fire it burned so hard one night, that it couldn't burn any-
more; 
So the captain he gave orders to lower the boats and save the 
crew,* 
While 1,000 rods of turf and 50,000 men were smothered in the 
Bugaboo.

NEVER GO BACK ON THE POOR. 
Am.—" Don't put your foot on a man when he's down" 
IN 
this world of sorrow, of toil and regret, 
There are scenes I 
would gladly pass o'er, 
But stern truth compels that each fact must be told, 
That thro' life we may check them the more. 
Is it right that a 
man who has well earned his pay 
On the pipes by the sweat of his brow, 
Should wait like a 
beggar content day by day, 
Or else home in hunger to go 3 
If a 
man is in trouble, remember this song, 
Go drive the grim wolf from his door, 
Assist bitn in need, you will seldom be wrong, 
If you never go back on the poor. 
F.-om the will Avaste of waters a 
death-cry came, 
As dashed on the iron- bound shore, 
A 
noble ship struck in the darkness of night, 
And sank ' mid the tempest's loud roar,

NEVER GO BACK ON THE POOR.—Continued. 
When the divers went down ' neath the wreck to search 
For the victims that lay far below, 
"'Tis only a 
steerage," was oft the remark, 
As the ghastly form came up to view. 
As if only a 
steerage could shut out a 
soul, 
Because poverty claimed him her own; 
As if dollars and dimes are the standard of worth, 
And the pass to all good that is known. 
CIIORUS. 
But the White Star must change its emblem aloft, 
To blood-red, afloat and ashore, 
Till the steamer Atlantic's forgotten by time, 
With its cargo of unburied poor. 
At the stands on the corner of every street, 
The aged and the blind used to be, 
And work out a 
living to save them from want, 
From the poor-house that they might be free. 
But HOW, stout Italians, healthy and strong, 
Each old grandmother's driven away ; 
I 
don't think the people will stand the base wrong, 
Of these people who work under pay. 
And the newsboy or bootblack that toils morn and night 
To keep hunger and pain from the door

IN THE BOWERY. 
To 
PASTOR'S great Sensation Song. 
Ant.— " Piccadilly." 
This song hasheen called for nightly for months in succession anti 
having been sung by Mr PAsTort in his own inimitable aisle, has beet) 
received with thunders of applause.I 
Some say that Central Park's the place, 
For fun of every kind ; 
On Broadway and Fifth avenue 
Much pleasure others find. 
But I'm a 
different sort of chap 
No fun in that I 
see, 
For when I 
want enjoyment 
The Bowery for me. 
Spoken.—Yes, you may talk about your Broadway belles, your 
Fifth avenue swells, your exquisitely- dressed creatures, with 
their lavender kids, and their la-de-da's, now, what do they know 
about enjoyment? 
They are afraid to go in for a 
little fun for 
fear of disarranging their toilets: and then what would Mrs. 
Grundy say ? " Charles Frederick Augustus is getting decidedly 
vulgar ; Seraphina Einelia is positively shocking !" 
But here in 
the Bowery, people enjoy themselves just when they f, el like it. 
They don't care a 
curse what others may say, for that's the cus-
tom. 
In the flowery, in the Bowery, 
For beautiful girls with bright eyes and dark curls, 
In the Bowery. in the Bowers-, 
That's were I 
r _side when I'm home. 
No butte .
olles of fashion there, 
Or idlers may be found, 
But men with open hearts and hands, 
With honest labor browned ; 
Men who, to help a 
friend in need, 
Would their last dollar lend, 
Who never live on alter folks, 
But earn the cash they spend. 
Spoken —Yes, there is no place in the flowery for those well-
:reesed eorner statues to try to look like millionaire's sons, while 
:heir mothers are out scrubbing her a 
dollar it day to sit port 
Own in idleness.

The other day a

While walking through the street, 
Insulted a 
poor working girl 
With whom he chanced to meet 
A young mechanic came along, 
And heard the words he said. 
He soon pitched in to the fop 
And on him put a

Was found the Bowery boys. 
Spoken—When the call came for soldiers in the hour of danger, 
the Bowery was the first to send its volunteers, and nobly did 
they do their duty. 
Who does not remember that incident at 
the battle of Anteatam, when the enemy charged in full force, 
one brave regiment bravely stood its ground, under a

and changed the tide of scenting defeat to one of glorious victory.

BANNER SONG. 
Written and sung by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
THERE is a 
foreign country proudly resting from its strife, 
That is mighty on the land or on the sea ; 
Its sons are true to freedom, to justice and to right, 
Awl its record is a 
bright one, you'll agree ; 
I 
sin , of that old country, of the dear old Fatherland, 
That is precious to its sons o'er all the earth ; 
And its memory will grow dearer when they oft and proud'y 
think, 
That to Frederick the Great, their land gave birth. 
Then here's the flag of Germany, 
It waves o'er good and true, 
Long may it float in peace, beside 
The Red, the White and Blue. 
Music—" Die Waclit dem Rhine." 
There is a 
little island that is known unto you all, 
And its banner I'll unfurl unto your gaze ; 
A bright and glorious emblem that you'll recognize at once, 
As the banner of its bright and better days ; 
The sunburst and the shamrock shall yet over them prevail, 
In that dear little isle across the sea, 
And no power of might or right shall dare that flag assail, 
For in time that little isle shall be set free. 
Then here's the flan of Ireland. 
And blessed be every fold, 
Her sons shall spre , d 
it to the breeze, 
As powerful as of old. 
Music—" The Harp that once through Tara's Hall." 
There is another country that I 
now will sing about, 
And Fin sure you'll conicide with what I 
say ; 
She has helped our nation nobly, when she needed help the 
most, 
But her glorious sons have now all passed away ; 
Although beaten in the late war, she will be herself again, 
And show the world how great then she can be ; 
No king or queen shall rule her, no matter what they say, 
For like America she will be free ! 
Then here's the National Standard, 
That now floats over France, 
Her Government is wide awake, 
And keen as any lance. 
Music," Marseillnise Hymn." 
(1) 
49 
BANNER SONG.—Continued. 
Ttere's another little island that is struggling to be free, 
From the tyrants and oppressors who rule there ; 
She's an honor to the New World, and al ornament besides, 
But her troubles, they are more than she can bear ; 
IIer oppressors are a 
brutal set who do not recognize 
The law which God has given to us all, 
But murder and cold butchery they deal to every one, 
And that little isle for help does on its call. 
Then here's the flan- of Cuba, 
Down trodden though she be, 
But Uncle Sam will soon send aid, 
And give her liberty. 
Music—" Cuba Shall be Free." 
There is a 
foreign country far beyond the rolling sea, 
With its castles and its power on every hand ; 
It has great men in its conztells, and of (rood men not a 
lack, 
And a 
language that we all can understand ; 
She's a great and mighty nation, though her faults we can't 
ignore, 
But the founder of our Union came from there ; 
So while we honor her ()Teat power and her noble sons of toil, 
Yet we trust our love of justice she will share. 
Then here's the hag of England, 
And while it long shall wave, 
May we ne'er fail to love the land, 
That to us Shakespeare nave, 
Music.—" God Save the Queen." 
There is still another country that is dear to every man, 
Who should love his brother ever as he ought ; 
It spreads the name of Liberty, where there is human life, 
'Tis the tia ,, that was with blood of h- roes bought ; 
Her doors are always open to the sufferini and oppressed, 
Who may there in peace and plenty speed the right ; 
Her defenders are the patriots who of free ,lom know the cost, 
For Lie banner they will ever gladly tight. 
Then here's our National Einbieni, 
The Flan that Ft eedotn won, 
And those beneath it dearly love 
The Laud of Washington. 
Music—" The Star Spangled Banner."

" 
THE SPADE." 
As sung by Gas Witunsis. 
Give me the Spade and the man who can use it ; 
A fig for your lord, and his soft silken hands. 
Let the man who has strength never stoop to abuse it, 
Give back to the giver—the land, boys, the land. 
There's no bank like the Earth to deposit your labor, 
The more you deposit the more you shall have ; 
If there's more than you want you can give to your neigh-
bor, 
And your name shall be dear to the true and the brave. 
CHORUS. 
Give me the Spade, &c. 
Give me the Spade— the American's glory— 
That fashions the field from the bleak barren moor, 
Let us speak of its praise in ballad and story, 
While 
tis brightened with labor, not tarnished with 
0-ore. 
It Was not the Sword that ipour best battles, 
Create t 
our Commerce. extended our Trade, 
Gave rood for our WiVez7,, our children. our cattle, 
But the Queen of all weapons— the Spade, boys, the 
Spade. 
Give me the Spade, C. 
Give me the Spade. there's a 
magie about it. 
That turns the black soil into bright shining gold,

Now the cornstack is raised and have cleared a

BEAUTIFUL SNOW. 
THE following is an account of the origin and publication of 
these beautiful lines, pronounced by the London Spectator to be 
" 
the finest American poem ever wi Wen." and now going the 
rounds a
,,ain, 
has been attributed to various authors, and 
among them Miss Dora Shaw. 
Miss Shaw is not the authoress. 
In the early part of the war, one dark Saturday morning in 
deal of winter, there died at the Commercial Hospital in Cin-
cinnati, a 
young woman, over whose head only two and twenty 
summers had passed. 
She had been once possessed of an envia-
ble share of beauty, and had been, as she herself says, " flat-
tered and sought for the charms of her fice;" but alas ! Upon 
her fair brow ha's long been written that terrible word—prosti-
tute! 
Once the pride of respectable parentage, her first wrong 
step was the small beginning of the " same old story over 
again," which has been the only life-history of thousands 
highly educated and accomplished in manners, she might have 
shone in the best of society. 
But the evil hour that proved her 
ruin was but the door from childhood, and having spent a 
young life in disgrace and shame, the poor friendless one died 
the melancholy death of a 
broken-hearted outcast. 
Among her p-rsonal effects wa:; found in manuscript the 
" 
Beautiful Snow," which was immediately carried to Enos B. 
Reed, a 
gentleman of culture and literary tastes, who was at the 
time Editor of the -
Vational Union. 
In the columns of that 
paper, on the morning of the day following the * Fs death, the 
poem aplleared in print for the first time. 
When the paper 
containing the poem came out on Sundly morning, the body of 
the poor victim had not yet received burial. 
The attention of 
Thomas Buchanan Read, one of the first of our American poets, 
was soon directed to 
the newly published lines, and was so

taken with their stirring pathos that he immediately proceeded 
to the hospital, from whence he followed the corpse to its final 
resting place. 
0, the snow, the beautiful snow! 
Filling the sky and earth below; 
Over the house- tops, over the street, 
Over the heads of the people you meet, 
Dancing, 
Flirting, 
Skimming along, 
Beautiful snow! it can do no wrong; 
Flying to kiss a 
fair lady's cheek, 
Clinging to lips in a 
frolicsome freak, 
Beautiful snow from the heaven above, 
Pure as an angel, but fickle as love! 
0, the snow, the beautiful snow! 
How the flakes gather and laugh as they go! 
Whirling about in their maddening fun, 
They play in their glee with every one. 
Chasing, 
Laughing, 
Hurrying by, 
It lights on the face and it sparkles the eye ; 
And even the dogs, with a 
bark and a 
bound, 
Snap at the crystals that eddy around ; 
The town is alive and its heart in a 
glow 
To welcome the coming of beautiful snow ! 
How the wild crowd goes swaying along, 
hailing each other with humor and song ! 
how the gay sledges, like meteors, flash by, 
Bright for a 
moment, then lost to the eye— 
Ringing, 
Swinging, 
Dashing they go, 
Over the crust of the beautiful snow ; 
Snow so pure when it falls from the sky, 
To be trampled in mud by the crowd rushing by, 
(2) 
BEAUTIFUL SNOW.—Concluded. 
To be trampled and tracked by the thousands of feet, 
Till it blends with the filth in the horrible street. 
Once I 
was pure as the snow—but I 
fell ! 
Fell like the snow flakes, from heaven to hell: 
Fell to be trampled as filth in the street; 
Fell to be scoffed, to be spit on and beat • 
Pleading, 
Cursing, 
Dreading to die, 
Selling my soul to whoever will buy ; 
Dealing in shame for a 
morsel of bread, 
Hating the living and fearing the dead; 
Merciful God! have I 
fallen so low 1 
And yet I 
was once like the beautiful snow. 
Once I 
was fair as the beautiful snow, 
With an eye like its crystal, a 
heart like its glow ; 
Once I 
was loved for my innocent grace, 
Flattered and sought for the charms of my face! 
Father, 
Mother, 
Sisters, all, 
God and myself, I 
have lost by my fall ; 
And the veriest wretch that goes shivering by, 
Will make a 
wide swoop least I 
wander too nigh; 
For of all that is on or about me I 
know 
There's nothing that's pure but the beautiful snow. 
Hew strange it should be that the beautiful snow 
Should fall on a 
sinner with no where to go! 
How strange it should be, if, ere night comes again, 
The snow and the ice strike my desperate brain; 
Fainting, 
Freezing, 
Dying alone, 
Too wicked for prayer, too weak for my moan 
To be heard in the crash of the crazy town, 
Gone mad in the joy of the snow coming down, 
I 
should lie and should die in my terrible woe, 
With a 
bed and a 
shroud of the beautiful snow.

By

Oii ! 
I 
wander 'mid the roses in the golden summer time, 
And listen to the streamlet while it rinas a

But far sweeter than the roses and the streamlet unto me,

CHORUS . 
She is the fairest flower ever sent to comfort me, 
Pure and gentle as an angel, darling Bessie of the lea, 
Yes, she is the fairest flower ever sent to comfort me, 
She is my star and treasure, darling Bessie of the lea. 
Not a 
bird in the wild wood but will answer to her call. 
Oh ! most I 
love the twilight when the pearly dew- drops fall, 
Then she meets Inc in the valley and she kindly welcomes me, 
My bonnie star of evening. darling Bessie of the lea. 
She is, etc.

Price five cents.] 
Behold in me a 
wretched man, quite broken down by woe, 
I've lost my wife and cannot find her anywhere I 
go ; 
At first she robbed me of my heart and now she's flown 
from me, 
And taken all my furniture, wherever can she be ? 
CIIORUS. 
Perhaps she's on the railway, with a 
swell so fair,— 
Perhaps she's up in a 
balloon, flying thro' the air; 
Perhaps she's dead, perhaps alive, perhaps she's on the sea ; 
Perhaps she's gone to Brigham Young, a 
3.1ormonite to be. 
She read so much of Mormonites, of nothing else she'd 
talk, 
And with a 
sanctified young chap each day she used to 
walk ; 
She said he was a 
Mormon saint from far across the sea. 
1 
have not seen her for a 
week, wherever can she be ? 
Perhaps she's, &c. 
She can't respect the marriage vows, that faithfully she 
swore, 
I 
only hope her Mormon spouse has fifty wives or more; 
I 
hope he'll thrash her every night when he comes home 
to tea, 
I 
hope they'll always row and fight wherever they may be. 
Perhaps she's, &e. 
I 
hope she'll have a 
lot of hungry, squalling brats to keep, 
I 
hope they'll cry all night, and never let her go to sleep ; 
I 
hope her chimney's all may smoke, her lodgers never pay, 
And German bands and organ men annoy her all the day, 
Perhaps she's, &e. 
If she is in the railway train. I 
hope that it will smash ; 
If up in a 
balloon, I 
hope she'll fall out with a 
crash ; 
If on the road to Salt Lake, then, I 
hope she may get 
drowned, 
Then I 
will get another wife and quickly I'll be bound. 
Perhaps she's, &e. 
vos vonst a 
shoemaker, but now you'll understand 
I 
vos Dutch musician in Flipenheimer's Band ; 
Dot band it was notorious for der moosic it does play, 
Such talented moosicians you don't find every day, 
But the other night we gave a

In honor of Miss Dinkenspiel vot come from Germany; 
Oh! jiminy Christmas ! you vould be oxtonished right avay, 
To see the style und fashions, dure, it vos a
