businesses there. Oscar and his wife moved to Toledo, Ohio after they got married to start their 
own business. His parents still run the other family business. 
0:07:35 - Oscar talks about how offering authentic Mexican food is a 
lot of work because they 
use all fresh ingredients and don't use canned products. 
They make their own spices and then combine them into their own recipes. 
0:08:30 - They alter their food very little to accommodate what Anglos' tastes are accustomed to. 
The Latino customers do not complain about the slight changes, because the authenticity of the 
food is so close.

community, Oscar said they take requests, but for the mostly already they know what the people 
in the community want. 
0:10:55 - The group discusses the diverse gastronomy of Mexico and how each of the 32 states 
in Mexico has its food variations. There might be a 
food found in one state that is not found in 
another. 
0:13:00 - The food that they serve is not the TexMex food that many American's and Mexican 
Americans are used to. Maria says that the authenticity of their food is why it's so popular 
because it is not TexMex. Also, it's what you would eat at someone's house in Mexico. 
Oscar describes their food as more homemade. 
0:14:00 - Asked if patrons request a 
certain regional Mexican food and, if so, are they able to 
provide that for their patrons. Oscar said that they are able to if they can find them. They import 
products from Central and Southern America. Maria said that many times they may have the 
same thing but it's just a 
different brand.

Oscar also tells a 
childhood story 
of betting his Anglo friends to eat a

toy inside for Three Kings Day) that they know that people will use 
in their holiday meals. 
0:33:02 - Asked if they ever consider doing a 
different job since it's so demanding and takes so 
much time. Oscar would not want to choose anything else because running a 
market is almost a 
family tradition and he has a 
passion for the career. Anna loves working at the market. They 
encourage their children to do better for themselves, but also want them to take interest in 
running a 
market. 
0:37:29 - When asked if the market offers a 
sense of community for those who are Latino, Oscar

growing number of American people 
come in as regulars, and they seem to enjoy the atmosphere/community of the market as well. 
0:39:46 - Can special or ethnic food help build a 
community? Maria: yes because food is the 
attraction and then you can learn so much more about people. She told a

Chinese lady whom her daughter knew. Oscar told 
story of serving a 
group of Chinese people who did not speak any English. 
0:42:00 - Oscar feels that the gratitude he receives from his job is better than monetary reward. 
0:42:51 - Talking about the weather affecting business. (The hard winter kept customers away.) 
Oscar also discusses his emphasis in his running of the grocery/restaurant is on the kitchen over 
the office work (that is why he hired Maria). Oscar and his wife are very conscious of making 
sure their customer satisfaction is achieved by getting out there and doing the work in the 
kitchen, market, and restaurant. 
0:45:08 - Asked about how owning an ethnic grocery store is part of them, their personality, or 
their family history.

come to work. 
0:47:55 - Oscar wants to try new things (foods in the restaurant which is part of the market) and 
test them out on a 
few new people. There are foods that they make at home that many people,

member of his church. Maria shares a 
story of sharing her cornbread recipe with Anna. 
0:50:52 - Oscar says that at lunchtime at the market he likes that they (employees) share their 
lunches with each other. Sharing food at a

child, if you have a 
little bag of chips in the lunch 
room when you open them up you offer some to others at the table. 
0:52:32 - Oscar explains why he believes the sharing occurs as part of the Mexican culture. Anna 
agrees with a

kid; she wanted a 
piece of candy and she would collect 
bottles and sell them to collect money.

story about the time his father gave him a 
sucker. He ate the whole sucker except 
for a 
small last bit on the stick and saved it for the next day.

you get.

"Of course". Anna agrees too and shares with how Oscar and his wife are very caring. 
0:57:45 - Oscar compares the communities that he has lived in and explains how he feels that 
Toledo's Latino community is very friendly, and Toledo is welcoming to Latinos. 
0:59:58 - Oscar uses local companies to buy food. Whatever they can't find here they will buy 
for a 
Mexican company in Chicago. 
1:01:04 - Mexicans and farming in the local region (NW 
Ohio). Anna shares how she came to 
America as a 
migrant worker with her family and picked cucumbers and tomatoes.

Oscar shares as story about talking to immigrant children and how they identify as an immigrant 
worker. Discuss the increase of prices since the change in immigration regulations. 
1:04:00 - Talk about the hiring practices of San Marcos. It's a 
family business and mostly run 
and owned by family. Talk about other restaurants and markets that are owned by Oscar's 
family. They run a 
store and restaurant in Elkhart, Indiana that Lucy has been to. 
Not all of the employees at San Marcos are family, but Oscar says that there are some that have 
been working with him long enough that they feel like part of his family. 
1:07:17 - Creating their own culinary culture, a 
blend of Mexican and American, in the San 
Marcos market. 
1:07:45 - Talk about going back to his hometown in Mexico with some employees from San 
Marcos. 
Oscar's hometown in Mexico is Aguascalientes. Anna's hometown in Mexico is in Tamaulipas, 
a 
Mexican State that borders Texas. 
They said the food is different from both of their hometown. The food in the US is similar to the 
food in Northern Mexico. 
1:11:00 - Discuss the differences in mole and how it's eaten. Mole is a 
big, traditional party food 
(weddings, quinceaiiera, and holidays). They sell mole in the store but they have never sold it in 
the restaurant. 
1:13:00 - TexMex food uses a 
lot of gravies on their foods unlike authentic Mexican dishes with 
the exception of mole. 
1:13:30 - Experiencing other cultures' foods. They enjoy exchanging recipes with each other for 
different Mexican recipes, but also recipes for American foods. Anna gave an example of 
making and sharing vegetable pizza with her friends who had never had it before. 
Oscar said you can get recipes on the computer, but it's better to get the recipe from an 
individual. 
1:16:42 - Talking about purple hominy--how to cook it and it being used to make pozole and 
used in menudo. 
There are variations in pozole with spices and pork or chicken.

the corn/hominy as maize. Pozole was a 
soup dish created in Mexico. 
1:20:20 - Oscar and Anna talk about eating and serving tripe to others who have not had it 
before.

Felt they are really embracing his culture's foods. 
1:21:44- Oscar tells a 
story about his mom making liver tacos and feeding them to his friends. 
1:22:35 - Talking about tripe. Tripe in a 
taco is different from in menudo. At San Marcos they 
fry the meat where most places boil it. 
It is an involved dish and Anna says she would rather buy 
it at the restaurant than make it at home. 
1:23:50 - Closing comments; Talk about pictures taken of the market
