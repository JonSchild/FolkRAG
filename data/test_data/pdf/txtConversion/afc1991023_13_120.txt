TXO1: The days are colder now, and the nights unblanketed. 
The 
morning's heat comes from the Dutch mocha coffee that Nora 
Rubinstein keeps in our refrigerator. 
Having downed a cup of 
that by 7:30 I set out for some victuals at the Presidential 
Lakes grocery store, taking a great shortcut from headquarters to 
route 70. 
The 
yardscapes in G—Presidential Lakes; 21GT are quite 
interesting--exotic plants often appear on the boundaries, Yuccas 
being among the most popular. 
Yuccas usually stand on one or 
both corners of the driveway, or 
in the middle of a whitewashed 
tire. 
While the highway is edged with sweet "licorice" 
goldenrod, blazing star, huckleberry bushes, sheep laurel, and 
other celebrated Pine Barrens flora, people choose to distinguish 
their spaces with plants that they have to nourish--plants that 
compete with the native flora, such as marigolds, coleus, phlox, 
fire thorn bushes and geraniums. 
Everything, 
it seems, can be 
edged: telephone poles, side walks, bases of bird baths, and the 
flag pole, planted I suspect, so that the crowd of red, white and 
pink, bogonias could riot around its base. 
The store at Presidential Lakes did not have whole wheat 
bread or plain yogurt so I finished that trip at the Acme 
in 
Browns Mills. 
Much of the day was spent in training sessions with Carl 
Fleischhauer on Nagras and Nikons, until, 
in mid—afternoon, 
everyone drifted out into the field. 
On the heels of five days 
of orientation on the region and on equipment operation and 
maintenance, Jens declared, "I know there must be folklife out 
there, 
if only I could get to them." 
So they all went: Jens to 
the coast, Christine and Elaine to get a closer look at the 
woodlands towns, Jay to find some contacts in the Browns Mills 
black communities, and Sue and I headed for Rova in Cassville. 
TX02: 
Before we'd travelled a mile through G—Lebanon Forest; 21GT, 
we met a couple of teen—aged boys on mopeds, whom we questioned 
regarding the moped scene. 
Dan Martin, of Lebanon Lakes, belongs 
to the Mercy Medical Squad in Woodland Township, and 
is also a 
deer hunter. 
He'll be around for the Endora--a dirt—biking event 
Hufford--83 Fieldnotes 
page 1 
that draws people from Philadelphia and New York, and that will 
take place next weekend in the Pits near Chatsworth. 
He won't be 
there as a contestant but in the line of duty as a rescue worker 
for the Mercy Squad--the only squad with blue lettering on the 
truck. 
He threatened, not in any serious way, I'm sure, to put a 
hole 
in my tire 
if I showed up during deer season. 
TX03: 
Although Lebanon Lakes is just across the highway from 
Presidential Lakes, G—Presidential Lakes; 21GT is universally 
regarded as the source of teen—aged crime in the area --
Christine observed several that were unmistakably affiliated with 
the punk rock scene, at least in terms of costume. 
We took the road through Whitesbog that emerges at Hanover 
Furnace, a place highly valued by folks like Frank Bannish, the 
Township Planner for Pemberton, but not necessarily regarded as 
noteworthy by 
local people. 
Enroute we were caught in a 
torrential downpour--a Topaz—engulfing flood that slowed our pace 
but didn't alter our course. 
We made it to Cassville. 
TX04: 
St. Vladimir's Church--one of two Russian Orthodox 
Churches, the other one being St. Mary's--comes suddenly into 
view on route 
527--a gold zweibel turin towering over the pine 
trees in the vicinity, above a mosaic icon image of Christ 
overlooking the parking lot with the same sort of geometric 
presence that informs the work of Bill Wasiovwich. 
Wasiovwich, a 
woodsman and carver from Woodmansie, likes to go and look at St. 
Vladimir's, according to Dick Jeffries, another local artist who 
has befriended Wasiovwich. 
In the vicinity of the Church are several gift shops and a 
restaurant. 
G—Cassville; 45GT 
Sue and I met a fellow in the 
parking lot who was just finishing up a conversation with a man 
who was, 
in his terms the best gynecologist in the area. 
This 
fellow told us we were not dressed for the mass that was 
starting--we would have to be wearing skirts and veils or scarves 
or hats 
if we were unmarried. 
So he took us to the gift shop and introduced us to the 
proprietress who was dressed in a peasant costume, hand— 
embroidered, she said, 
in Russia. 
Russian is her first language, 
and she did not seem much interested in an extended conversation 
with us. 
When not engaged with customers, she sang, supplying 
Russian words to the music blaring from cheap speakers in front 
of the shop. 
The old men stood on the board walk leading into the 
restaurant laughing and talking in Russian. 
Inside are the accoutrements for being Russian away from 
Russia -- ceramic samovars, both life—sized and 
in miniature, 
elaborate wood inlaid boxes, a guitar for $175.00, costumes, and

icons, some of them hand painted by a deceased man who lived 
in 
Rhode Island. 
A selection of buttons available declared: "Kiss 
me, 
I'm (Russian) (Lithuanian)"; "Russian (Puerto Rican) Power"; 
and "Black is Beautiful". 
This is a case for a Russian speaker, 
perhaps Elena or Joseph.

We ate at the International Cafe for dinner and witnessed 
the dismay of the Korean woman who owns the place when she 
discovered that two local youths had left without paying. 
She 
refused to 
let us have a menu.

TX01: Sunday morning I breakfasted at the International Cafe, the 
place where I'd had substantial sukayaki the night before. 
G-Browns Mills; 21GT 
The menu there is 
international 
in the sense 
that the famed New Yorker's cognitive map of the country is 
comprehensive. 
The variety of Oriental cuisine from Japan, 
China, and Korea is complemented by a pan-American selection of 
cheeseburgers, hamburgers, tuna fish sandwiches and the like, 
with scrapple available for breakfast. There are Oriental Ribs, 
Rice Cake Soup, Udong Soup, Fried Mondue, and Oriental Steak 
(sukayaki), to be complemented with Mrs. Smith's pies for 
dessert. 
The proprietor, whose name is Nancy, gave us bubble gum 
when we had paid our checks. 
(foodways) 
The interior of this remodelled dairy bar is done in a 
classic kitsch style--with blonde panelling (the kind dubbed 
"mobile-home panelling" by Carl Fleischhauer) spaced between the 
perma-stoned corners. 
The running boards are spray painted in 
bright pink, and a bower of plastic flowers and one real cactus 
hanging from a white wrought-iron trellis lends ambience to the 
dining area, where Nancy and her daughter served customers who 
were black as well as white, but not oriental (at least while we 
were there.) 
TX02: 
Jay Orr and I drove to two of the local black churches --
both on G-Route 530; 21GT. 
One, the True Vine Baptist Church, was 
the church of Ulysses Jenkins, with whom Jay had spoken the day 
before. The second was the A.M.E. church out towards Whitesbog 
(or Whitesbogs, as many of the older local people call 
it). 
Both 
churches were silent from the parking lot, which was filled with 
large, shiny cars--the earmarks, perhaps, of upwardly mobile 
congregations. We did not go 
in, since we weren't dressed for it, 
but returned instead to headquarters, where Jay's assistance was 
needed on the computers, and Carl was ready to outfit 
fieldworkers, including myself, for documentation. 
TX03: 
That afternoon I set out, this time fully rigged with a 
stereo Nagra and two Nikon cameras, and Jay, 
in search of a place 
that I'd heard referred to as the G-Clay Pits; 49GT. 
Several years 
Hufford--83 Fieldnotes 
page 4 
ago Dave Ennis, of ANJEC (Association of New Jersey Environmental 
Councils) had given me directions to this remote section of the 
Pinelands. It 
is east of the railroad tracks that run through 
Woodmansie, Buckingham, and Pasadena (aka Wheatland), and just 
out of Lebanon State Forest. 
We hoped to go and observe people 
driving four—wheel drive trucks through a huge mud hole--an 
activity I'd heard referred to as "getting stuck", but first we 
had to find it. 
While Jay drove, I navigated from a USGS map 
that is still fairly accurate, though one has to trust to 
luck 
after leaving the macadam road and reassuring presence of the 
parallel railroad tracks. 
From there the gravel road leads to a 
network of ever—narrowing sand roads. 
When I was convinced we 
were in the right general vicinity, we stopped, rolled down our 
windows, and listened. 
In the distance, just to the northeast, 
we heard powerful motors, gunning, like chain saws. 
Turning 
around in a thicket of scrub oak, we headed toward the sound. 
Suddenly we were there, 
in a place that had been gouged into 
mounds and hollows by an extractive industry. 
Those mounds and 
hollows teemed with an activity superimposed on the clay miner's 
landscape--motorcycles buzzed around the mounds like angry 
hornets, and we inched toward a parking space with supreme 
caution. 
The parking space overlooked a "lake" that is probably 
no more than four feet at its deepest. Around the perimeters, the 
lake was an astonishing turquoise blue. 
At the center, however, 
where three large trucks were making their way through, there was 
nothing but mud. 
One truck was pulling another by means of a 
heavy cable. 
On the banks, on both sides of the lake were 
spectators--drinking beer, talking, and giving occasional hoots 
of encouragement to the drivers. 
recreation. 
The object of the sport is to make it all the way through 
the lake without getting stuck. 
Vehicles most likely to make it 
all 
the way through have been specially adapted with waterproofed 
distributors and extremely high wheels with deep grooves to 
enhance the traction. 
There were three—wheeled vehicles as well, 
and a dune buggy. 
Most of the people appeared to be 
in their 
twenties and thirties, with the exception of one youth who looked 
to be about 12, and who won the admiration of many with his 
antics on a three—wheeled vehicle. 
It was sheer spectacle, with some oddly juxtaposed elements. 
The motors blazed continuously with a kind of raw power. There 
seemed to be two kinds of activity--an idling, "priming" of 
vehicles as they bounced around the perimeter, and a focussed 
display of power that drew the attention of everyone when a 
vehicle withdrew from its orbit to head straight for the center 
of the lake. 
The appearance of a vehicle at the crest of the 
perimeter--the landing, slide, runway, or whatever--was dramatic, 
as was its steady movement into the lake amid a spray of mud and, 
sometimes, exhaust. 
The hole that many vehicles concentrated on 
on that afternoon was one that these vehicles made--someone said 
that when the lake was clear, you can read the terrain on the 
Hufford--83 Fieldnotes 
page 5 
bottom, and determine the path most likely to 
lead to a 
successful crossing. 
Those who are first to take that path may 
succeed, but they also make it harder for whoever follows, by 
churning up more mud. 
We saw this in the deepening of the 
favored crossing on Sunday. 
A vehicle would get into it, and 
sometimes go onto two wheels before becoming disabled--no longer 
able to propel 
itself. 
Other vehicles would then come to the 
rescue. Meanwhile, the antics of motorcyclists would continue--
very much like the clowns at a rodeo or the cheerleaders at a 
football game, until another truck appeared on the crest of the 
hill 
to throw down the gauntlet. 
The words that come to mind are oddly suited to this 
spectacle of man and machines: romping, leaping, plunging, 
bounding, and at the core a profound paradox, cast into relief by 
a fellow who says, "We're all here to help each other out." 
"But," I couldn't refrain from pointing out, "The fellow is 
getting himself stuck on purpose!" 
"Good clean fun" was another description offered by a mud— 
flecked participant. 
There is something truly urban about this phenomenon. 
The 
people gathered there are strangers, some from Philadelphia, 
Cherry Hill, Medford, and from Warren Grove as well. 
They are 
in 
a sense, "triangulating"--relating to one another through their 
vehicles, as (author?) noted of strangers and performers in 
Washington Square. 
There seems to be some value placed on not 
knowing some of the people who are there so that the emphasis is 
on helping people out for its own sake, rather than for other 
reasons. 
One fellow complained that occasionally someone will 
dig you out and then expect to be paid. 
"George! You said you made that mudhole?" someone shouted 
incredulously as I was taking notes. 
There are magazines catering to these people. 
One is called 
Off Track, and another was mentioned on the tape. 
My impression is that this phenomenon provides us with an 
example of a contemporary sport/ ritual that bears further 
investigation. 
The activity is controversial -- I have heard 
many local people complain about dirt bikes tearing up the roads. 
I also have a home movie from Caroline and Norman Taylor that 
features a motorcycle run that their son Eddie participated in. 
The controversy is reflected in other ways. 
The place, "Hidden 
Lakes", 
is not on the map, accountable for in part by the newness 
of 
its use--one fellow calculated that it has been used for this 
since 1978. 
I once heard another name for the place, bestowed by 
Johnny Earlin: "The Hippie Factory." 
He said someone asked him 
where Hidden Lakes was, and he, knowing full well 
its location, 
responded: "I don't know about no Hidden Lakes, but if you want 
Hufford--83 Fieldnotes 
page 6 
to know where the Hippie Factory is, I can show you that. 
They've made more hippies there than any place I know." 
His 
remark was perhaps a commentary on the adoption of a hippie look 
by a younger generation that is more established and probably 
more redneck than hippies were. 
Earlin, 
in his 70's, may be 
collapsing several younger generations. The land is, apparently, 
privately owned, though no one with whom I spoke could identify 
the owner. 
There are no trash cans, though the area is used 
extensively all weekend, every weekend. 
There is a mound of beer 
bottles and cans -- like rabbits, people don't litter 
indiscriminately -- which likewise attests to the ambiguity of a 
place poised between anarchy and organized fun.

This afternoon I drove around G—Lebanon Forest: 21GT to try 
and locate places that I'd heard of 
in order to photograph them--
places like Reeves Bogs, South Branch, and the Dry Ponds. 
On 
Shinn's Branch Road I encountered a fellow with an Italian 
accent--a condominium builder from Tom's River who was busy 
gathering mushrooms. 
Although he was too suspicious of me to 
give his name, he did let me take some pictures, and answered 
some of my questions. 
He used to have a permit to cut wood in 
the forest--in conjunction with the Homecutters program (exact 
title?)--but only to cut oak, not pine. 
It was in this section 
that he did the cutting. 
Wherever the oak had been cut, he said, 
edible mushrooms will appear around their bases, around this time 
of the year, and after it has rained. 
A consequence then of 
Saturday's deluge. 
He did not respond to my hint that I would 
like to have one specimen to identify, other than to warn against 
snakes when gathering them. 
I think he thought I was a 
competitor. 
(plant) 
He had slipped away from his work in order to gather the 
mushrooms, which he had 
in two bushel baskets, though they barely 
covered the bottom in each. 
He complained about the permit 
system for obtaining firewood -- a lottery, he called it, adding 
slyly, "But for me, you know, my number never {has to} come up!." 
He came to this country at the age of 16, and has been picking 
mushrooms for years. 
The oak stumps have to be two or three 
years old before they'll sprout mushrooms. 
During my ride with 
Ranger Earl Danley later that afternoon I learned that the 
woodcutting program was exactly three years old. 
I also learned 
a number of interesting ways to read oak trees from Danley. 
With regard to the Italian fellow, the mystery wrapped in 
the enigma remains: 
Why did he have so few mushrooms in 
different baskets if they were, as he said, all the same kind? I 
will watch for the rain and go back to that oak stand to look for 
viscous, yellowish mushrooms with gills. 
Earl Danley, who grew up 
in Pemberton, told me that many 
oriental people (he didn't know whether they were Koreans) pick 
Hufford--83 Fieldnotes 
page 8 
the ferns in the spring time, and he showed me two kinds of 
ferns--one that they pick, one that they don't . He doesn't have 
a name for either variety. 
He did tell me of an Italian family 
by the name of Cassidy that hunts mushrooms. 
They live on New 
Lisbon Road, and would, he said, be happy to talk to someone 
about it. 
Danley took me past the Penny Pine Plantation, to the Pakim 
Pond camping area, and to the Nature Center where the old Glass 
House used to be. 
We were out for several hours, and he offered 
to continue the tour another time. 
(I'll finish these notes 
after I've logged the tape.) 
G—Lebanon State Forest; 21GT 
TX02: 
That evening I went to visit Jack and Ann Davis, an 
elderly couple in their eighties whose parents came to the area. 
Both of them knew G—Whitesbog; 21GT as children--Ann's father was 
the Lou Grant of those days. 
(Lou Grant was an old foreman who 
knew the berry business inside and out.) 
Both Jack and Ann are 
hunters who have hunted many square miles of the woods all 
the 
way from Southampton to Berkeley and south to Hammonton. 
I 
wanted to secure a promise from them that they would go with me 
on a tour of places that are, or used to be important to them. 
I 
also wanted to pay my respects to them as a friend from several 
years back. 
Things have not been good for them over the past year. 
Jack's son—in—law and former inseparable hunting companion 
separated from Jack's daughter, and so they are not on speaking 
terms. 
Jack's Maryland Hounds and beagles have not left their 
pen for more than a year, a circumstance that is more related to 
a second misfortune. 
About a year ago, Ann had a stroke that put 
her in the hospital on and off for months. 
"I was afraid we was 
gonna lose her," Jack told me. 
Even now, 
in a state of advanced 
recovery, she 
is not like her former self. 
She has lost weight, 
and spends much of the day in a reclining chair. 
Her spirits 
are, understandably, much lower than I have ever seen them. 
She 
depends on an aluminum walker for mobility. 
(animal) 
They seemed glad for the diversion of the interview, 
speaking with ease into the Sennheiser microphones I'd rigged up 
to capture their voices in stereo. 
Ann spoke first, while Jack 
listened very quietly. 
I don't think he interrupted her even 
once, which impressed me, since so often I have noticed that 
couples tend to speak contrapuntally -- finishing each other's 
sentences and inserting clauses freely. 
When it was his turn to 
speak I was disgruntled to notice that she had turned her head 
away from us, as if to tune us out. 
Jack was not speaking into 
the microphone, but was turned toward me, who sat between them. 
Suddenly I realized that, on the contrary, she was extremely 
attentive, and was giving us her good ear, though she had to 
look 
away to do so. 
Jack, 
in turning away from the microphone, was 
directing his speech into her ear. 
I was struck then by the 
strength of the devotion they have for each other, 
even though 
Hufford--83 Fieldnotes 
page 9 
it's always been apparent. 
They would like to go on the tour I proposed, 
though the 
weather will have to be cooler and Ann will have to be 
in good 
shape for it. 
He said he'd had her out in the truck that Sunday. 
They tired earlier that night than they have previously -- though 
it was Ann who was tired, more than Jack.

TX01: This morning was devoted to writing up my fieldnotes from 
Sunday afternoon, and to small organizational tasks around the 
office, followed by a session with Christine over her strategies 
for approaching some of the subjects she's likely to encounter. 
This afternoon I went over to visit Mark and Ann Darlington, 
and their two small daughters, Emily and Tessa, both of whom were 
feeling sick. 
On my way there I stopped to talk with Tom 
Darlington, Mark's father, and the owner of J.J. White Cranberry 
Company. 
It's harvest time there, and they are among the oldest 
operations in the Pinelands. 
G—Whitesbog; 21GT 
Mark and Ann live 
in a house on the southeastern side of the 
bogs -- an 
isolated spot for a house that they've recently 
expanded and remodelled. 
G—Whitesbog; 21GT 
"We'll probably live 
here the rest of our lives," Ann remarked by way of explanation, 
"So we might as well make it really pleasant." 
She could not 
remember the name of the flower I brought in for her to identify, 
but commented that Tom had told her what it was one time -- a 
Pine Barrens endemic in any case, that I will have to identify. 
Ann did observe that, like cranberries, she had seen these 
blossoms turn pink with the chill of fall. 
Pinkness is something 
that Tom Darlington is trying to foster in the cranberries he 
harvests, since Ocean Spray pays more for the redder ones. 
White 
cranberries don't make it on the market. 
There are some changes pending, or to be hoped for around 
the place. 
The section known as Pole Bridge is to be converted 
into bogs, 
in accordance with a twenty—five year lease that the 
Darlingtons have with Lebanon State Forest. 
The problem is that 
the State Forest won't permit them to place a trailer or a 
dwelling near the bogs in order to house someone who could keep 
an eye on them, mostly to guard against vandalism. 
Vandalism is a problem, and was connected by both Ann 
Darlington and Earl Danley, the ranger whom I interviewed here 
yesterday, with the large number of people on welfare in Browns 
Mills. 
They are the ones, according to Ann and Earl, responsible 
Hufford--83 Fieldnotes 
page 11 
for the expansive dumps in Pole Bridge. 
The other problem faced by the cranberry operation is the 
challenge posed by an absentee owner of a large tract of land 
adjacent to their bogs, which, according to Ann, 
is currently not 
in any use. 
The speculator had hoped to sell to developers, but 
was thwarted by the establishment of the National Reserve. 
She 
still refuses to sell to the Darlingtons, demanding an exorbitant 
amount of money that they are unwilling to offer. 
In that 
instance the impact of the Pinelands Commission is more subtle. 
Lou Grant, the closest thing they had to a foreman -- he was 
more like a ranger or caretaker -- died last year, taking with 
him a vast and unrecorded knowledge of basic bog behavior. 
In 
his stead this year is Bobby Hopkins, whose name I believe I've 
heard from Norman Taylor. 
"Does he have a brother named Leon?" I 
asked. 
"No, I think his brother's name is Lester," Mark replied. 
I'm willing to bet that it's Leon. 
As Mark and Ann freely admit, 
they do not fraternize much with the local people. 
Their friends 
include people in Moorestown, whom Mark met when he attended the 
Friends School there. 
The family is of old Quaker stock. At any 
rate, Bobby's son is 
into dirt biking, and, according to Mark, 
is 
probably familiar with the clay pits at Hidden Lakes. 
If that's 
so, that makes two sons of foxhunters that I've encountered who 
prefer dirt biking to foxhunting -- at this stage in their lives, 
the other being Eddie, the son of Norman Taylor. 
Mark used to enjoy dirt biking -- through Lebanon Forest and 
the Wharton Tract. 
He now regards aspects of dirt biking with 
distaste, as destructive of trails and auditory canals. 
He mentioned a place that he'd heard Bobby mention, named 
"Willy's Hill" -- a sand and gravel site up toward Hanover 
Furnace. It was a new name to him, and he located it 
approximately for me on my Browns Mills quadrangle. 
I asked him about the extent to which cranberry growers face 
different challenges based upon their locations. 
He said that he 
knows that Whitesbog is often twenty degrees colder than Haines' 
bogs at Hog Wallow, but that temperature variation can be 
surprisingly substantial, even from one bog to another in 
Whitesbog. 
What can often make a bigger difference than 
location, he said, 
is the variety of cranberries. 
That's 
something I'd like to find out more about.

--morning office activities and trip to Whitesbog 
--trip to oriental food and gift shop 
in Brown's Mills 
--tour of Lebanon State Forest with Chris Bethman, the 
superintendant 
--dinner and meeting with team in the evening 
Carl and Jay left early this afternoon. 
While waiting for 
their departure I busied myself with organizational tasks, and a 
quick trip to Whitesbog to say hello to Caroline Taylor. 
The 
Taylors are an old established family in the G— Browns Mills; 21GT 
area, and friends of mine from several years ago. 
Caroline and 
her husband Norman agreed to take me on a tour of Lebanon Forest 
that would complement the tours I was taking with forest 
officials. 
I spent some time talking with Tom Darlington as 
well. 
He has an ex—sister—in—law living in Washington with whom 
he would like me to get in touch. 
Caroline invited me to come to 
lunch with herself and Norman on the following day, and I agreed 
to be there. 
I then went to the Pemberton Township police department to 
obtain an interview with Ed Carmen--a policeman who is married to 
Lou Grant's daughter, and who knows the township inside and out. 
Although he was too busy at that time to work with me on 
annotating some topographic maps, he did promise to talk with me 
soon. 
He mentioned, 
in passing, some interesting things. 
For 
one thing, there is a black civic association in the area, 
representing the exclusively black neighborhoods. 
He also spent 
some time musing on the sort of mixing up of cultures that is 
occurring in Browns Mills--symbolized by the appearances of the 
offspring of racially mixed marriages. 
Since I had invited the team to a dinner/ meeting this 
evening, I spent some time shopping for the ingredients right 
after Carl and Jay left. 
I decided I would try to find some tofu 
and some fancy soy sauce at Haruko's, an oriental store I used to 
patronize, but enroute my eye was captured by Eugene's Oriental 
Food and Gift Shop, and I stopped to look around in there. 
I 
Huff ord--83 FieIdnotes 
page 13 
found what I was looking for and then some. 
Although none of the 
sales people were very conversant in English, they agreed to 
let 
me photograph the store, 
inside and out. 
While I was snapping 
pictures inside I got into a conversation with Kimberly Banghart 
(sp?), a young Korean woman who is married to a German fellow and 
lives at Fort Dix. 
With her help I was then able to interview 
one of the salespeople. 
Unfortunately, I was using the new Sony 
cassette recorder with two lavalier microphones, and for some 
reason the microphones weren't working, although I found that the 
built—in microphone does work. 
At any rate, the information, as reconstructed from memory, 
goes something like this. 
Eugene's has been there for only one 
year, and serves a burgeoning Asiatic population that has 
filtered into the area through Fort Dix. 
Most of the people are 
Korean and Japanese--there are few Chinese people here. 
The 
Korean population worships at Saint Anne's Catholic Church (there 
was a sign with information about St. Anne's, 
in an Oriental 
script, up by the cash register, and a poster advertising a 
performance by Japanese dancer who, from what I could gather, 
lives 
in Lakehurst). 
Koreans also worship at the Korean Baptist 
Church on route 530, every Sunday at 2 p.m. 
The services feature 
Korean singing. 
Kimberly is 
in the choir. 
G—Browns Mills; 21GT 
Some of the produce at the store is grown in a garden behind 
it. 
The proprietress indicated that the red hot peppers strewn 
on the floor behind us had been grown by her, and that she 
intended to dry and sell them. 
She said that they grow hotter in 
America than they do 
in Korea. 
They mentioned some other plants 
that Koreans have grown here in gardens, from seeds originating 
in Korea, but the names were unfamiliar to me, and I can't recall 
them. 
They were quite friendly and will be receptive to anyone 
who returns wishing to document their gardens, foodways, and 
music. 
The store also caters to the population at large 
in Browns 
Mills. 
People often come in wondering how to prepare certain 
foods, and leave armed with tips from the proprietress and a few 
exotic items to try out. 
TX02: 
When I returned to the house I assembled dinner -- which 
consisted of rice and vegetables -- including carrots, red 
peppers, tofu, ginger, garlic and zucchini squash, while Sue 
prepared a peach cobbler. 
I then left for a tour of whatever 
could be seen in the remaining daylight with Chris Bethmann. 
He 
took me to some of the spots that Danley had covered. 
G—Lebanon 
State Forest; 21GT 
About four things of particular interest stand 
out in my memory. 
He showed me a plantation of hybridized pines 
-- wherein pitch pines were crossed with loblollies, commenting 
that it might be offensive to extreme preservationists. 
Bethmann 
personally thinks the pitch pine needs to have its appearance 
improved. 
A second thing is his story about the house at Reeves 
bogs, which they have been unable to rid of squatters 
Hufford--83 Fieldnotes 
page 14 
squatters who turned out to include someone I had met during my 
foxhunting fieldwork. 
He also had some stories about some local 
characters that I will transcribe when I get to the tape. 
At the goose pond, as the sun was setting, I removed a 
couple of sundew plants from the edge to take back to the kitchen 
for fruit fly control. 
At dinner and afterwards we talked, as we usually do, about 
what people are finding. 
At this stage, most of the field trips 
serve to give the fieldworkers a sense of the place they are 
working in. 
People have been documenting the people and sites 
that grab their attention. 
I asked that each fieldworker try to 
interview a municipal official -- said officials to be selected 
by inquiring at the Pinelands Commission and among people we 
already know. 
The purpose of the interview would be to derive an 
overview of each township, an overview that would crystallize 
into annotations on the quadrangle maps that fall 
into each 
fieldworker's territory. 
People agreed, though I sensed some 
resistance. 
I think that people conducting folklife research 
tend to shy away from official channels of information that could 
actually prove to be invaluable. 
I suggested that they try for a 
policeman or a township planner or a township administrator or 
mayor. 
The point is, as Alice D'Arcy of the Pinelands Commission 
observed, to find someone at that level who is involved with the 
people beyond the extent of processing applications, which means 
that in every township the official 
is 
likely to occupy a 
different office. 
We'll see how that goes.

TX01: This morning Sue and I set out to visit Frank Bannish, the 
Township Planner for Pemberton Township in Burlington County, and 
for Dennis and Upper Townships in Cape May. 
He gave us a guided 
tour, so to speak, of cultural groups and land uses throughout 
the Pemberton Township area. 
As Sue is transcribing that 
particular tape I'll not commit all the details of that meeting 
to print here. 
The strategy of having a township planner talk us 
through several quadrangle maps was invaluable. 
He commented on 
the relationship between Fort Dix (aka Camp Dix prior to WWI) as 
one that is not always beneficial to the local community, though 
it 
is an old relationship. 
Themes that he touched on included 
the faded resort area -- which South Jersey seems to be full of, 
when one considers the history of Chatsworth, Browns Mills, 
Lakewood, and even sections of the shore -- the high incidence of 
juvenile crime, which emanates not from the black and hispanic 
sections, but from the suburban Presidential Lakes -- and the 
elusive nature of the term "Piney". 
He will try to provide us 
with a list of contact people for various communities. Sue made 
friends with Earl Piper, the municipal code enforcement officer 
for Pemberton--a local fellow with whom Sue will work further. 
Jens should get in touch with William Kubiak, the building 
inspector for Dennis Township (861-5375) and Frank Murphy, the 
Mayor (263-8800), and, for Upper Township, Mayor Leonard 
Migliaccio (of an old farming family there) and building 
inspector Robert Hassipen. 
I called Kimberly Bankhardt (sp.?), the Korean woman who 
belongs to the Korean Baptist Church choir, and who I met 
yesterday in Eugene's Oriental Food and Gift shop on Route 530 in 
Brown's Mills. 
She will welcome a phone call and visit from Sue 
early next week. 
TX02: 
Then I went to have lunch with Norman and Caroline Taylor, 
a couple with whom I have been friendly now for several years. 
Caroline, who 
is 
in her fifties, 
is an administrative assistant 
for J.J. White Cranberry Growers, and has been for more than ten 
years. 
She is from Philadelphia, but came to G—Browns Mills; 21GT 
each summer from the time she was a small girl. 
Like Norman, her 
Hufford--83 Fieldnotes 
page 16 
husband who is now retired, she is keenly interested in the woods 
and the life they support. 
Norman's family has been in the 
Browns Mills area since the 18th century, and he 
is thoroughly at 
home 
in the woods. 
On a tour of the local area this afternoon, 
he showed me four places in which he'd lived since childhood, 
including his present home, which he built. 
To get to their house, you turn off of Route 530 onto Quail 
Hill Road, which takes you through a little development that 
Bannish identified as predominantly black. 
Norman commented at 
the end of our drive that they don't know all 
of the people who 
live there. 
You pass Pole Bridge Road, perhaps thinking, as I 
did, "That must meander for quite a ways until 
it crosses Pole 
Bridge--maybe I'll try that on the way back and see whether it 
will take me to Route 70." (I tried it on the way back, and 
it 
didn't). 
At the end of Quail Hill Road you come to Harding 
Boulevard -- which is a sand road, onto which you turn left, 
passing a gray trailer on your left as you do so, and coming face 
to face with a mailbox plastered with fox decals on both sides, 
which had to be accommodated by whoever inscribed around them: 
Norman, Caroline Taylor/ 312 Harding Boulevard. 
Turning right 
into the driveway, your ears are assailed by baying hounds, your 
eyes by pickup trucks, cars, horses, a bird bath, a dog pen 
enclosing about thirty foxhounds, and lots of vegetation. 
Norman, who still sometimes thinks my name 
is Lydia, greeted 
me at the door. 
Inside, 
in the kitchen, Caroline was just 
setting out a plate of ham, cheese, tomatoes, and cracked wheat 
bread, with generic mayonaise. 
As we ate, the conversation 
drifted to their trip to Nebraska last spring -- they had driven 
to the continental divide and back, via Kansas and Missouri. 
The 
animals were, predictably, of great interest to them -- the ring— 
necked pheasants, prairie dogs, one coyote, many rabbits, and no 
eagles. 
(foodways) 
Caroline recalled a great horned owl that was sighted near 
Whitesbog, and how Freeman was called in to catch it, because its 
wing was apparently injured. 
She and Bobby (Hopkins, I presume) 
were watching, and she lamented not having a movie camera to 
capture the event. 
Freeman used a box, she said, to prompt the 
bird into -- holding its injured wing to the side. 
Somehow the 
Owl Lovers Association came up, 
in connection with the name of 
the veterinarian in Tabernacle -- Jerome Glickstein (an Irishman, 
Norman said, tongue in cheek) who treated the bird (268-2100). By 
that time we were dipping ginger snaps into Celestial Seasonings 
Mandarin Orange tea, and the afternoon's agenda was set -- we 
would go on a drive through the Browns Mills/ Lebanon Forest 
area, to be narrated by Norman, and tape—recorded by me, and 
accompanied by Caroline. 
On the way out to the car, we slipped into a tour of the 
yard, which, 
lamentably, I did not record or photograph. 
The 
images are still vivid, however. 
It began with the plants 
Hufford--83 Fieldnotes 
page 17 
hanging outside the door--where they stay for the summer. 
She 
has got a large number of succulents, including a crown of thorns 
that has been blooming for 18 months, a rope plant, a moses—in— 
the—cradle, a rock plant, and cacti for Christmas, Easter 
(presently in bloom) and Thanksgiving. 
Thanks to the recent 
rainfall, they have a variety of mushrooms growing in the yard. 
Norman demonstrated how to peel the skin off of one (a specimen 
is now "sporing" for me 
in the kitchen) preparatory to cooking 
it, 
as he said his mother used to for spaghetti sauce, and he 
still does. 
Another variety, which he called a "button 
mushroom", Caroline was skeptical about eating. 
"There are very 
few mushrooms you can't eat," he said. 
yardscapes, (plant). 
On a chair near the cacti et al, Caroline has some holly 
trees sprouting in tiny planters. 
She removed them from under a 
large holly tree near the horse pasture. 
Something she said made 
me think that she ascribes a role in the germination process to 
the birds. 
Two highlights of the trip occurred after the batteries had 
worn down on the cassette recorder. 
One took place along Glass 
House Road -- near what I think Norman called "Glass House 
Swamp". 
As we were driving by there, he stopped the truck and 
jumped out, saying, "I'm going to check and see whether there's 
been a gray fox out here." 
So saying, he disappeared down a 
thickly sugar sanded road, and reappeared, declaring, "I saw 
evidence of three deer and one gray fox back there. 
Come see. " 
So we got out, Caroline and I, 
to go see. 
Sure enough, there 
were three sets of deer tracks, and one dainty set of cat—like 
tracks, that Norman identified as the legacy of 
a gray fox. 
He'd told me earlier that he had planted 9 red fox on the north 
side of route 70, and 10 on the south side, but had seen no trace 
of a gray fox. 
This satisfied him that he could come find one 
if 
he wanted to. 
While we were standing there, Norman gave me a 
lesson on how to distinguish a gray fox track from a red fox 
track. 
The gray is quite round, whereas the red 
is elongated, to 
put it simply. 
He also pointed to some very green pine tips that 
were scattered about, saying, "You know what did that, don't you? 
Gray squirrels. 
They also did that," 
he added, pointing to a 
slew of dismantled pine cones, and picking up a pine cone core, 
reminiscent of one that a squirrel had thrown down on me several 
weeks ago at the Developmental Center, he elaborated on the 
eating habits of squirrels. 
Birds also love pine seeds, he 
continued, recalling that he used to call on Allyns Manufactory 
for sacks of them, 
in order to feed the birds around his house. 
(animal) 
While we were standing there, Caroline discovered a neat 
little clump of reindeer moss, and had a discussion with Norman 
about the kind of moss that Tom Darlington's wife is 
looking for 
-- was it British Soldiers, Norman wondered. 
Caroline didn't 
think so, and we headed back to the truck, where Norman found her 
a paper towel on which to rest the moss. 
(plant) 
Hufford--83 Fieldnotes 
page 18 
To me the entire episode seemed like a small performance of 
woodsmanship, the kind of thing I'd hoped would happen in the 
course of the tour. 
The other highlight was having the grave of Lead pointed out 
to me, even though it was at 40 mph. (remember "Sport").

Spent the morning on the phone lining up municipal contacts for 
myself, Sue, Elaine, Christine, and Jens. 
Their task for the 
next week is to augment their casual encounters with 
living 
authors of the landscape by getting someone with an overview, 
however biased that overview may be, to share it with them, and 
to help them to fill 
in their maps with cultural 
information, 
such as "Here are the black communities," and "these are the 
names we used to have for those bodies of water." 
Then I went to 
open a bank account with Sue. 
This afternoon I visited Richard Gille, the zoning official 
for Lacey Township, and one of two "natives" who administer to 
the township.

--Morning's office activities 
--Interview and tour with boys from Lebanon Lakes 
--Tabernacle auction in the evening 
--Wee hours of the morning incident 
I spent the morning making plans for the afternoon -- called 
the Manchester Township Police Department in search of Richard 
Payne, the nephew, I believe, of Harry and Herbert Payne. 
He is 
also the chief of police, and was recommended to me by Russell 
Canfield as a knowledgeable resource for an overview of the 
township, 
in 
lieu of the township planner, who Alice D'Arcy 
warned me would not know as much as Frank Bannish does about 
Pemberton. 
Alice, one of three planning liaisons for the 
Pinelands Commission, suggested that she might know as much as 
anyone about who lives where in Manchester Township. 
Richard 
Payne, however, as a policeman and a member of one of the oldest 
black families in Whiting, 
is 
likely to be quite helpful. I 
suggested to Sue that she might try contacting him in my absence, 
but if she has no time for it, I will certainly try again next 
week. 
Suffice it to say that he was unavailable on Saturday 
morning, so I decided to pursue another topic that I'm curious 
about: the use of woodlands space by children. 
TX02: 
I asked Pat (?) at the Lebanon Forest office whether she 
knew of any kids who regularly play in the woods, particularly in 
the area surrounding Lebanon Lakes, a lake community about two 
miles from our headquarters. 
She replied that she does often see 
a group of boys riding on the forest roads on bicycles -- 
in 
fact, she said, any Saturday you can just bet on 
it that they'll 
ride up to the fire tower, park their bikes, and climb up to the 
top. She didn't know who they are, but she said that if I drove 
around for a while I would probably find them. 
G—Lebanon State 
Forest; 21GT 
Before setting out I worked with Jens for a while to puzzle 
out the manner whereby slides should be logged and stored. 
He 
was starting on the first batch to be 
logged up there, so , at 
Hufford--83 Fieldnotes 
page 21 
his request, I delayed my departure. 
Then I took off 
in the direction of Lebanon Lakes. 
Once I 
got there, 
it wasn't long before I saw them -- four boys riding 
on bicycles. 
I pulled up alongside of them and stated my name 
and business -- Mary Hufford, interested in what it is that 
people, including kids, use the woods for. 
"For instance," I 
elaborated to the four flummoxed but interested faces, "Do you 
ever build shacks in the woods?" 
"We build forts," one of them responded. 
"Would you mind 
letting me photograph one, and letting me interview you with my 
tape recorder?" I asked. 
"I have one," volunteered an eleven— 
year old named Mark. "But that's not in the woods," a thirteen 
year old corrected him. 
"Yes it 
is. I'll show you." 
And so I 
began to follow them. 
The fort was, as it turned out, 
in Mark's back yard, but in 
a heavily wooded section. 
The one—room structure was nestled in 
a pre—existing sandy dugout, and incorporated a diversified array 
of materials into itself. 
Plywood was nailed into place and held 
down with bricks. 
On top of 
it was a very large slingshot -- to 
call 
it a catapult would not be to exaggerate. 
I gathered that 
it was useful for firing acorns at would—be invaders. 
A short 
metal 
ladder, probably adapted from a sliding board, connected 
the roof to the ground. 
As we talked, I photographed, and then 
we headed off to view two other sites, both of them in a "real 
woods" section -- an 
island that was perhaps four or five acres 
large, and had no houses on 
it, but was surrounded by a road. 
We 
could see vehicles passing -- every time one passed the 
conversation halted while the boys tried to identify the driver 
of the vehicle, who most assuredly could not see us. 
architecture, children 
We arrived at the first "fort" (they do not call these 
places "shacks" as we did when I was growing up 
in Western 
Pennsylvania -- shacks are run—down dwellings in which people 
really live) by means of a path which they explained to me was an 
old deer trail. 
They apologized for its condition -- apparently 
it had been vandalized by younger kids, 
indignant at being 
excluded from its precincts. 
I was impressed to see that it had 
a matching couch and chair. 
To be elaborated on: social organization of kids and forts 
--stories about Freeman Taylor 
--bicycle stunts, popping wheelies and 
the like 
--their place names and views of certain 
plants and animals 
TX03: 
That evening Jens and I met Christine at the Tabernacle 
Auction--an event that occurs on Thursdays and Saturdays--every 
week. G—Tabernacle; 25GT 
Ronnie Harker was the auctioneer, whose 
style I did not find as exciting to listen to as that of Howard 
Hufford--83 Fieldnotes 
page 22 
Strothers, an auctioneer I recorded several years ago 
in Southern 
Indiana. 
The event in 
its entirety was nonetheless exciting --
as with the four—wheeling in Hidden Lakes, one has the sense that 
here is "where the action is". 
People are definitely there as 
much for entertainment as for economic reasons. 
There is plenty 
of sheer spectacle. I was amazed at the variety of birds, 
rabbits, and horses that were offered for sale. 
One bystander 
with whom I spoke likened the event to a parade, and I think he 
was referring to the people milling around as much as he was to 
the items being sold. 
Another fellow said that, though he often 
comes not intending to buy anything, he gets caught up 
in the 
excitement and winds up going home with an electric blanket or a 
spade that he didn't really need. 
Among those milling around 
were people trying to give away kittens and puppies. 
Most of the 
takers seemed to be small children, who could be seen toward the 
end of the evening contentedly cuddling their prizes. 
Opposite 
the auctioneer is a set of bleachers, filled with people who 
clearly have come more to watch than to buy, and they do so 
nibbling on hotdogs that they've gotten from the adjacent 
concession. 
(animal), marketing, (celebration), (foodways) 
I was fascinated with the animals that were available. 
As 
each animal was auctioned off, the "walker" would grab it and 
hold it high above his head amid a flurry of squawks, squeals, 
grunts, and much wriggling. 
I interviewed two particularly interesting people--one a 
scotsman with a thick brogue who made some interesting contrasts 
between Scotland and South Jersey, the other, a fellow from South 
Carolina who was especially interested in mules, since he keeps 
them himself for coonhunting. 
Other members of the coonhunters 
association also use mules, and there was a mule show last 
weekend. 
A social dimension in marketing is fostered at this auction 
and at the yard sales, which Christine thinks are more pronounced 
in the Pinelands than anywhere she's ever been. 
I might agree. I 
wonder whether Tupperware owes its success to the fact that it 
combines marketing with socializing. 
Perhaps it succeeds most 
among women with agoraphobia. 
I will continue this section after I've logged the tape. 
TX04: 
My third encounter with Pinelands culture came totally 
unexpectedly, and was due to unfortunate circumstances. 
As I was sitting in my car around 11:30, preparing to leave, 
I was astonished to see four young adults stagger toward me out 
of the woods. G—Lebanon State Forest; 21GT 
One of the girls was 
holding another girl up, and while they and a third girl 
leaned 
against one of the Lebanon Forest trucks, the young fellow who 
was with them came over to my car. 
"Is there anybody working in 
the ranger station,?" he asked, panting. 
I told him that someone 
Hufford--83 Fieldnotes 
page 23 
., 
would be working, but probably would not be 
in the office, and 
asked what was the matter. 
The fellow works for the state forest, as a maintenance 
worker, 
in fact (I wonder if he was the boy that Pat said they'd 
hired a year ago, who'd stopped into the office for years, as a 
routine stop on his bicycle route) -- at some point later in the 
evening he asked whether our heater was working yet. 
At any 
rate, he had been driving 
around the woods with the three girls 
when another truck had come along and run them into a ditch, and 
they were staggering because they'd had such a long walk. 
One 
girl, who is the niece of a fellow I'd met when riding with 
Norman Taylor, 
was clutching her side and crying in pain. 
I invited them to use our phone to call for help, which came 
in the form of a ranger who was on duty. 
When he suggested we 
call 
an ambulance for the injured woman (who will remain nameless 
here), she fiercely declined, and insisted on waiting until the 
truck was mobilized. 
So, while the men went off to move the 
truck, I sat with D. 
and K. 
in the kitchen over tea, while C. 
slept soundly on the couch in the living room. 
Despite all my 
efforts to get them to notify their parents (they are seniors in 
high school) they refused -- declaring that they'd rather 
postpone the wrath they would face. 
For the same reason they 
refused to 
let me summon the first aid squad. 
I suspected that 
some drugs may have been involved, but believed when they denied 
it. 
Finally D.'s pain was so great that I ignored her protests 
and called Central dispatch, the emergency number in Mount Holly. 
The EMT people wanted to take her to the hospital 
immediately, 
and when she refused, a shouting match ensued. (Sue, who was 
trying to sleep upstairs at the time, 
told me the next morning 
that she had imagined the worst -- that Jens and I were waging a 
battle under the influence of alcohol). 
One of the EMT people 
checked her eyes and declared her pupils to be fully dilated. 
As they left for the hospital, the young fellow showed up 
in 
the truck, which lacked a headlight. 
The last I saw of them they 
were all headed for the hospital. 
The encounter was sobering. 
It reminded me of how glad I am 
to be out of high school. 
It also gave me a glimpse of some of 
the activities pursued by that age group (suspected drug usage 
aside). 
D. told me that their plans for that evening had been 
to ride out to "the rye field" to watch deer feeding, and then to 
go and look at the bear hole -- a place out on Reeves Bogs that 
I've heard mentioned a number of times. 
They talked a little 
about four—wheeling as well. 
What really came through at times, 
however, was a certain sensitivity about the animals 
especially the deer.

Lots of things have happened since I arrived here on 
Monday afternoon, armed with the maps bestowed upon us by John 
Sinton. 
The maps detail the distribution of ethnic groups 
throughout the Pinelands. 
So far we've had little chance to 
appeal to them, given the amount of leads we have that we'll 
never be able to follow up on by November. 
Anyway, I got here on 
Monday. 
Monday night I logged some tapes and waited for Tuesday 
to roll around, which it did, shortly after midnight, but not 
before I discovered that I had left my suitcase in Washington.

Carl arrived on Tuesday, bringing the suitcase. On Tuesday 
I also picked up a car from Rent—a—Dent in Pemberton. 
While 
waiting for the car I was befriended by an elderly gentleman 
named Charlie Powell, who seems to be thoroughly acquainted with 
the Pemberton/ Woodland Township backwoods areas. 
We agreed that 
we should get together at a later date for a tour. 
One thing in 
that place interested me. 
It was a senorita, or a Chiquita 
banana type lady whose body was a Budweiser can, with arms made 
out of bottle caps, her hands of tab tops, her face a little 
wooden piece, her hat an ashtray (she was actually an ashtray), 
and she had large hoop earrings. re—use, arts and crafts. 
I talked with David Cohen that afternoon. 
The Commission 
has agreed that he should contribute to the project by doing some 
historical background research that might illuminate our 
findings. 
I logged tapes, 
several of them, and planned for the 
imminent arrival of numerous part—time fieldworkers.

On Wednesday, Rita Moonsammy arrived to help with some 
fieldwork. 
Within the hour she was off with Joseph to visit 
Father Konstantin Fedoroff of St. Vladimir's Russian Orthodox 
Church in G—Cassville; 45GT, to try to secure permission for us to 
attend a mass and document it. 
She returned with the news that 
the bishop will probably grant the permission, but we won't know 
for another week or so. 
Father Konstantin is an 
icon painter who 
has been working on the interior of the church in anticipation of 
its 50 year anniversary in two (or is 
it four?) years. 
The 
interior of the church is therefore in an unfinished state, and 
our photographic privileges may be curtailed as a result. 
At any 
rate, Rita was ebullient over her findings on her return, since 
they involve a kind of artistry that she feels the arts council 
will have to pay some heed to. 
And then she went home.

Thursday morning Tom Carroll, Mal O'Connor, Bonnie Blair, 
and Nora Rubinstein arrived. 
Jens Lund left for a Pioneer 
America meeting in Illinois. 
Christine visited a planner in 
Medford, and packed for her trip to Newfoundland to defend her 
dissertation. 
Carl trained the first three people on the 
recording equipment, and I gave them some leads to follow. 
Tom 
was to visit Joe Reid, a master garvey (bayman's work boat, 
indigenous to South Jersey) builder, Hurley Conklin, a decoy 
carver, and make some inroads into the fire companies in the 
area, perhaps specifically in Warren Grove. He was also to visit 
someone working out of one of Joe Reid's boats. 
Mal was to 
begin, with Joseph and I on Friday, by visiting Cliff Frazee, and 
touring Frazee's tree farm in Waretown. 
He was also to pay 
attention to Bill Lucas, a local woodworker, and Frazee's son who 
runs a sawmill 
in Double Trouble, and who also supplies people 
like Sam Hunt and Joe Reid with wood for their boats. 
Nora 
suggested that he contact a glassworker that she'd seen south of 
here, named Durofee. 
Bonnie was to get into the Hispanic 
community, through various and sundry leads. 
They all 
set out on 
Thursday afternoon. 
Thursday evening we all 
ate at Mayo's, and had a great time.

Friday. 
Joseph knocked on my door at six a.m. 
At 6:50 
Joseph, Mal and I were on our way to G—Forked River; 49GT to meet 
with Clifford Frazee, a long—time resident of Forked River, who 
manages some stands of cedar and pine back 
in the Forked River 
Mountains to the west of G—Waretown; 53GT. 
Before setting out with 
Cliff to tour some of his 800 (?) acres of woodland, we visited 
for a while with his wife Lucille. 
She 
is quite a fan of his, by 
the way, who reminded us several times that Cliff has a more than 
prodigious knowledge of the woods. 
Her forte, however, 
is 
dollmaking, a skill she plies with some help from a popular 
instruction manual. 
She also makes hooked rugs, and one example 
of her work that I walked on sported pine trees silhouetted 
against a large setting sun, a design of her own making. 
On one 
wall of the same room is a plaque that was awarded to Cliff for 
his outstanding management of the trees on his farm. 
(plant) 
Mal 
rode with Cliff to the site, with Joseph and I 
following. 
We drove down Route 9 to 532, and took 532 to the 
entrance to Joe Albert's hunting cabin and home. 
The road 
is 
called Bryant Road, I believe, and 
is 
lined with a variety of 
signs that Joseph photographed on the way out. 
Joe Albert was 
out foxhunting, according to Cliff, but at his suggestion we 
parked the car near to the dog kennel, 
in which a few Walker 
foxhounds and Beagles noisily took notice of our arrival and 
departure. 
Joseph and I then climbed onto the broad back of 
Cliff's pickup truck, while Mal joined Cliff in the cab, and we 
were off. (animal) 
From the back of the truck, Joseph and I could see where we 
had been, 
and we watched what seemed like miles of narrow sand 
road framed by short pine trees and scrub oak dwindling in our 
wake. 
Occasionally our heads were tousled by pine boughs, and 
often I wondered whether my jaw would need to be readjusted after 
having been so jostled. 
At any rate, we travelled at a good 
clip, at least as fast as some sneezes go. 
Sneezes, I'm told, 
have been clocked at 100 miles per hour. 
Lucille was anxious for us to appreciate her husband's 
Hufford--83 Fieldnotes 
page 28 
accomplishments. 
"It's amazing what he's done there," she told 
us as we were leaving. "He's cleared it all 
out, made it look 
like a park in some places. 
Of course, 
it's not all 
like that--
in some places he's the only one who can tell what's been done." 
She also tried to warn us about what actually did happen -- that 
her husband could easily wear us out. 
Cliff is presently managing several stands of cedar. 
The 
one he 
is cutting is not the best one he has, but he has to cut 
it because he bought it from someone who retained an option to 
buy 
it back in four years. 
Since clearing the land is a two year 
proposition, and he could lose the land 
in two years, Cliff is 
harvesting the cedar on that section of the North Branch of the 
Forked River now. 
One sees the work in progress only after 
pursuing an arduous path through several old and devastated 
corduroy roads and plowing one's way through dense walls of 
huckleberry. 
Although the sphagnum moss growing at the base of 
the cedars we passed is the biggest I've ever seen, Cliff said 
that it 
is not prize sphagnum for gathering. 
The really good 
sphagnum moss is not two or three inches long, but almost a foot 
long, he told us. 
He calculated that there must be 15 or 20 
varieties of wild huckleberry, and identified one for us as 
"huckleberry bells", because of the bell—shaped blossom that it 
bears. 
wood processing, (plant) 
(The rest of this 
is written from memory, on November 4, 
1383, back 
in Washington) 
He also identified a Towhee from its sound as a "Twink". 
Alan Jabbour later pointed out to me that a colloquial term in 
vogue prior to the twentieth century was "Chewink"--an 
onomatopoetic term based on the bird's call. In the mountain 
south the same process of naming yields "Joe Reid." 
Several aspects of Cliff's conceptualization of his work 
struck me. 
He speaks of competition between cedars and swamp 
maples and gums and this provides an organizing principle for his 
nurturing of cedar saplings beneath the cedar tops. 
This 
practice also inhibits browsing deer. 
There is competition as 
well among members of the same species, and for every cedar tree 
that lives to be harvested when it 
is a hundred years old, there 
are dozens that die along the way -- shaded or crowded away. 
He 
is 
into the business of shaping cedar swamps and pine forests, 
according to deliberate canons of taste. 
And he shapes what he 
can't possibly harvest, since the lead time is a hundred years. 
His work is very dangerous, and he discusses balance as a 
critical factor -- nothing is securely anchored -- cedar trees 
practically float, standing in what amounts to water and sphagnum 
MOSS. 
Consequently they sway 
in the wind, and cause each other 
to 
lean over. 
Paradoxically these competitive trees support each 
other in this manner, and this 
in 
itself represents a kind of 
balance. 
I had a funny sense that Cliff is not a tree farmer 
Hufford--83 Fieldnotes 
page 23 
when he 
is 
in the cedar swamp, but rather a tree shepherd. 
The 
acoustics in the swamp are lovely -- dampened by the moss 
underfoot, and backed by the creaking of cedar trees -- called 
"cedar music" by Jack Cervetto -- 
in the wind. 
To get back to 
the dangers of his work, Cliff 
is often standing on a bouncing 
bough with a chain saw in one hand and knowing how to move and 
supporting oneself in this treacherous terrain is 
largely, as he 
says, a question of balance. 
Several other things struck me about his way of relating to 
the woods. 
At one point, when we visited his pine tree farm, 
which was, as Lucille told us, all cleared out so 
it looks "just 
like a park", he orchestrated a search for charcoal pits, sending 
each of us out through the woods as 
if on a deer drive, to 
look 
for small clearings, carpeted with pine needles. 
Such clearings 
often exist because for two or three feet beneath them the ground 
is nothing but charcoal, a medium in which nothing can grow. 
At 
the base of some of these are butts from the pits that burned 
anywhere from fifty to one hundred years ago. 
On these butts can 
be found the axe "curfs" placed there by the woodsmen who are 
Clifford Frazee's predecessors, and 
in some cases, ancestors. 
Joseph pointed out to me later that, to an axeman (Cliff 
suggested several times that we take a picture of him trimming 
cedar trees with an axe--the point being that he was not using a 
power tool for this task) a century—old axe "curf" 
is an 
important cultural artifact. 
The important lesson for me 
in all 
of this 
is that people who use the woods regularly are perhaps 
more intent on reading the culture of the place than they are on 
reading the nature, and this 
is an important distinction between 
their way of relating to the environment and the way that nature 
lovers who come there for the day are prone to relate to the same 
place. 
He also took great pride in showing us the exact location 
of the oldest road in the area--Stout's Road--a road barely 
discernible but for the slight dip 
in the contour of the forest 
floor here and there. 
He says he found the road first and 
verified its location on an old map. 
I have marked this road 
with his help on my quadrangle for that area. 
We 
left Clifford at Joe Albert's and headed back up route 
72, stopping for lunch at a roadside stand. 
TX02: 
On my return I spent some time coordinating appointments 
and fieldworkers for Eugene Hunn's imminent visit. 
Elaine 
Thatcher secured an appointment for herself and Eugene with Leo 
and Hazel Landy for Saturday afternoon. 
The Landys operate a 
cottage industry called "Nature's Florist Supplies" 
through 
which they employ many local people in the gathering and 
processing of native plants for florists. 
Their names for the 
plants are colloquial and 
in some cases, they've made them up 
themselves. (See Eugene Hunn's fieldnotes for that day.) 
Rita 
scheduled a session with Tom Brown, a trapper and poet who lives 
in Millville but uses the marshes extensively in the Delaware Bay 
area, for Monday, and Joseph agreed to set something up with Bill 
Hufford--83 Fieldnotes 
page 30 
Wasiovwich, the fellow who was immortalized in McPhee's book as 
the reclusive, artful hermit who makes his living gathering pine 
cones and sphagnum moss. 
An appointment that Sue had scheduled 
with Helen Zimmer for Sunday afternoon had been cancelled at that 
point. 
That was all for the best, because Eugene needed some 
time to simply acquaint himself with the plants and animals of 
what was for him an extremely exotic area. 
(He has worked among 
the Tzeltal Indians of Mexico, and the Aborigines of Australia, 
but not much among contemporary Americans). 
That evening I set out to meet Eugene Hunn at the airport, 
and on our drive back we talked at some length about his role in 
the project. 
He seemed to balk initially at the prospect of 
"sampling" people with plant and animal "repertoires" in 
different ecological zones, favoring a more specific case study 
approach, given his time limitations. 
I think that at this point 
his greatest contribution will be to propose several case 
studies, based upon his visits to people in varied settings. 
We 
both agreed that he needed to balance his immersion in people 
with his immersion in the natural setting, which he managed to do 
very gracefully, while keeping the appointments that had been 
made in anticipation of his arrival. (See his fieldnotes). 
Saturday (Oct. 8) I made several recording appointments with 
the Second Baptist Church in South Tom's River.

Our quest to include some music from a black church among 
our documentation led us back to the Second Baptist Church in a 
small area named G—Manitou Park; 43GT or 44GT, an area that is 
annexed to, but not quite a part of, South Tom's River. 
I knew 
several people in the congregation there from my fieldwork in 
Berkeley Township in 1979. 
Mildred and Eddie Brown are on the 
custodial staff at Central Regional High School, and Mildred, who 
has a powerful voice, 
is a leader in the choir there. There are 
now, as there were then, two choirs: 
the Senior Choir and the 
Gospel Chorus. 
The minister is new -- Reverend Lawson has not 
been there for more than two years, and he commutes with his 
wife, son and daughter, from Freehold. 
Reta Lawson, his wife, 
conducts the gospel chorus, which is small 
in number, and 
comprised largely, as it turns out, of people from two families 
-- the Richardsons who now live in Whiting, and the Lawsons. 
Mario Lawson was the percussionist (another percussionist, also 
in his teens, was Tony Mason), and soloists included Michelle 
Lawson and Evelyn Richardson, both of whom I would judge to be 
in 
their early teens.) 
The music was upbeat, modern, and in several 
instances, very difficult, an indication of what Carl spotted as 
Reta's aspirations for upward mobility, culturally, for the 
group. 
It was a practice session, and as such, was valuable for 
information that Sunday morning performances do not convey. As 
Carl noted, there was quite a lot of discussion about costume--
they are instituting black skirts/ slacks and white blouses/ 
shirts in the stead of something that was "peach color rose". 
There was also the use of a tape for teaching a song, the quality 
of which was so poor that Carl and I couldn't hear much music in 
it -- yet the chorus picked right up on 
it. 
Mrs. Lawson also 
"choreographed," 
in the sense that she cued people in their 
swaying to the music, 
and she read them the riot act over their 
inability to "get" certain phrases, which I thought were 
extremely difficult. 
I think the song was "Be Grateful." 
About midway through the session a few teen aged boys and a 
girl wandered in. 
One of the fellows sat down at the piano, and, 
Hufford--83 Fieldnotes 
page 32 
after only two or three attempts, picked up the key and proceeded 
to accompany the chorus. 
No one took very much note of his 
presence. 
The girl, who was quite spiffily dressed, sat down in 
front of us, and the other fellow got into a busy discussion with 
Mario. 
The girl recently moved there from Brooklyn (and her 
gestures and accent showed that she'd spent a great deal of time 
there.) She attends the Holy Temple Church of God in Christ just 
down the street, and she invited us to go to one of those 
services too. 
Mrs. Lawson described their set—up with some 
amusement -- mentioning their use of washboard and tamborines, 
and the length of their services (three hours over and against 
their one hour). 
The book that is 
in the pews is: The Baptist 
Standard Hymnal with Responsive Readings, edited by Mrs. A.M. 
Townsend, professor of Church Worship, Music and Pageantry, 
Sunday School Publishing Board, National Baptist Convention, 
U.S.A. Incorporated, Nashville, Tennessee, 37001, 
Mrs. C.N. 
Adkins, executive Director, 1973. 
Townsend Press 330 Charlotte 
Avenue. 
They get lots of sheet music and tapes from a "Black Bible 
Store" at the Englishtown Auction. 
A word about the church interior. 
Before you get into the 
church, you walk through an anteroom that is flanked on the left 
by the minister's vestibule and on the right by a sound—proofed 
room with a window into the church, a kind of vestibule for the 
choir. 
Down the stairs to the left is the basement, where 
childrens' Sunday school classes are held. 
Down there as well 
are the bathrooms, which are very spare. 
Over the doorway into 
the church hangs a velvet depiction of the Last Supper. 
In the 
vestibule, the velvet painting is of the thorn—crowned Christ. In 
the back of the church are two real plants -- a schifflera in the 
right corner and a ferny—looking thing to the left. 
Looking to 
the front of the church past the pews one sees the recessed space 
that holds the Baptismal font, accentuated by a velvet painting 
of the Sacred Heart. 
Directly in the center line 
is a lectern, 
below which is placed on a table a cross and a bible. 
Flanking 
the lectern are silk flowers, blue and white: gladiolis, 
carnations, 
and daisies. 
Nothing is plastic, I think. 
interiors, architecture. 
The teen aged boys were, as I said, quite spiffily dressed. 
One of them had a sort of Michael Jackson hair style. 
Another 
wore circular tortoise shell glasses. 
Tony Mason, the second 
percussionist, wore a black sports jacket and shirt, with a white 
tie. 
He played with a toothpick in his mouth, manuevering it 
about with a studied nonchalance.

Carl and I attended the church service at the Second 
Baptist Church 
in the morning. G—Manitou Park; 43GT or 44GT 
We 
arrived in time to hear some of the adult Sunday School class 
being conducted in the church. 
There were among the half dozen 
or so 
in attendance Deacon Wallace Clark, Deacon Joseph Green, 
and Annie Logwood. 
I was sort of captivated by a discussion they 
got into regarding the Tree of Lebanon. 
It went something like 
this: 
"What is the tree of Lebanon, anyway?" 
"I think it's an olive tree." 
"I've never seen one, have you?" 
"No, I don't think it grows in this country." 
"Maybe it's a fig tree." 
For more detail regarding the rest, see my tape log. 
I will 
comment that, following the service, Harry Payne came up and 
embraced me warmly, and invited me to visit him at his home in 
Whiting. 
Harry, a woodsman now in his seventies, was interviewed 
by Herbert Halpert in the 1930s. 
I also was glad to meet Evelyn 
James, the mother of Mrs. Richardson whom I'd met the night 
before. 
She grew up 
in South Toms River and now lives in 
Whiting. 
I plan to return to her if possible.

TXO1: These are my first fieldnotes since Christine's death here, 
four days ago. 
A lot has happened since then, and the project is 
very different now. 
On Monday evening I was preparing to come 
here from Washington. 
At that point my plan was to bring Charley 
Camp with me -- he had expressed an interest in seeing our use of 
the computers in our project either here or 
in Washington. 
I was 
planning to conduct 
a dry run of the projected tour for the 
media, which was to occur on November 17, and was to begin in 
Philadelphia, moving east on 70 to 206, south on 206, with some 
guidance from Christine who saw that as an 
interesting stretch of 
highway, and to stop at the Putiris in Elwood where they would be 
making grave blankets, as part of their Christmas enterprise, 
using sphagnum moss that they still plan to gather on Tuesday, 
with Sue and Elaine along to document the process. 
From there 
the tour would proceed to Nesco for a stop at the Landy's, then 
to Green Bank, where Eileen Homiller, a ninth generation local 
woman, firefighter, and cranberry/ blueberry grower, would talk 
with them. 
Lunch would probably have been taken at Allen's Clam 
Bar 
in New Gretna, followed by a stop at Joe Reid's "boatworks" 
in Waretown, with perhaps even a little trip to the bay with his 
guidance. 
The last stop after that would probably have been at 
Rova Farms in Cassville. 
There were mixed feelings on the 
subject from the fieldworkers. 
Nora had, at my request, broached 
the subject with Jack Cervetto, who had, she reported, been 
singularly disinterested in the proposition. 
John Sinton told me 
later that Cervetto is outraged of 
late at the way things are. 
For example, he has been told to stop cutting cedar on his own 
land, a situation laden with irony 
in 
light of the law's 
powerlessness to compensate the Haineses for their loss of thirty 
acres of cedar to a thief. 
I had spoken with Christine that afternoon, regarding her 
plans for the remainder of the project. 
She had outlined her 
plan for the remainder of the week, which included visits to the 
Lees, to Garfield DeMarco, to Brad Thompson's aunt's house --
Mrs. Hitchner at Possum Trot -- with its interesting example of 
a "New Jersey Tightwinder" -- a staircase that Brad says came 
here from England, where it was connected somehow to the 
Hufford--83 Fieldnotes 
page 36 
positioning of the fireplace. 
Now the fireplace is prone to 
occur on the opposite side of the room. 
She reported having 
visited the garden club in Medford with Elaine -- a meeting that 
was dominated by Betty Woodford, whose invitation to visit the 
Cedar Run Wildlife Refuge was turned down by Elaine for want of 
time. 
She confessed, somewhat shyly, that she would be unable to 
do any more in Evesham, Medford, or Shamong -- though she 
recommended that someone like Carl or myself try to do something 
with the Shamong Township little league. 
She talked again about her fascination with the different 
ways one person may have of talking about the land, depending 
upon whether work or play is being discussed. 
She used the word 
"cameo" 
in connection with this, I think. 
Are the Pinelands for 
working or playing in? 
The cameo would occur in the 
juxtaposition of Landy's view of the land against Woodford's. 
We 
also talked about the tour -- and I know she wasn't enamored of 
the idea, any more than Nora was. 
Anyway, I went to pick up a loveseat for my apartment, and 
spent hours then cleaning the place up. 
Finally at midnight I 
went to bed, 
leaving the chore of packing my suitcase for the 
morning. 
I was deeply asleep when the phone rang, and it rang several 
times before I fumbled my way to 
it. It was Sue, 
and I'll never 
forget the cry 
in her voice, how it sounded when she said, 
"Christine got run over by a car." 
Shock and disbelief were my 
first responses, 
and, 
like the others, as I learned later, I 
couldn't get my clothes on as fast as I needed to 
in order to 
carry out what Sue requested -- she needed information on 
Christine's next of kin, for which I would have to go into the 
office. 
I couldn't get there very quickly either, by car, for 
the streets were barricaded by policemen in the aftermath of the 
bombing of the Senate room in the Capitol Building. 
It was about 
2:30 a.m., and the night was wrung dry with its own disasters. 
In the office I spoke with Sue again, with Heather Poscius, who 
cried softly into the phone when I told her what had happened, 
and sent Gerry over to Memorial University to look up the needed 
information. 
In our respective offices in the morning's wee 
hours, we continued to work, urgently and helplessly. 
I called 
Alan too, and spoke with Karen, who was still up reading. 
Alan 
had just returned from Philadelphia, where he'd delivered a 
colloquium on "Ten Things I Wish Every Folklorist Knew." 
In the morning I set out for New Jersey, but with Alan 
instead of Charley. 
We arrived at hq 
later in the afternoon, 
where we all talked about what had happened.

TX01: Just for now I'm going to ignore the stack of fieldnotes I 
still need to produce for last week, long enough to review the 
day's events. 
Tuesday I drove to D.C. with Sue, returned the 
rental car, and spent the day and evening talking with Alan and 
then Carl about the exhibit over which the arts council and 
several 
in—state institutions (The New Jersey Conservation 
Foundation and Smithville) are expressing enthusiasm. 
Carl and I 
completed a first edit of the slides, with several upcoming 
showings in mind. 
One was for yesterday, and never happened, 
since we arrived too late for the actual meeting. 
The next 
opportunity will be on Wednesday, November 30, for people who are 
interested in putting on this exhibit. 
That will be followed by 
a slide/ tape presentation for the Pinelands Commission on 
Friday, December 2. 
On December 1 I hope to visit Evelyn James, 
the woman I met at the Second Baptist Church in South Toms River, 
an appointment I made today. 
On December 3 Bonnie has plans to 
attend some sort of Puerto Rican religious celebration in 
Hammonton. 
Hazel and Leo Landy have invited me to return for the 
grave blanket making and placing, sometime in the third week of 
December. 
Anyway, Carl and I drove up here yesterday in a cargo van, 
rented by the Library from Northeast Ford in D.C. 
We arrived in 
Smithville in time for a discussion with Dirk van Nest, Rita 
Moonsammy, and Sue Samuelson about various facets of the proposed 
exhibit. 
My contribution, hopefully before the 30th, will 
consist of a storyboard, or chart, 
illustrating points that can 
be made by an exhibit from this project. 
Lots of apprehension 
was expressed concerning the appropriateness of our partnership 
with Smithville in such a venture, and Carl advised caution in 
the promising of large amounts of Center staff time and effort. 
More on this later. 
This morning, which was to have been the day of the media 
tour, I entered project headquarters to find Brian Griggsby, of 
the Philadelphia Inquirer waiting for me. 
Sue, Elaine and Carl 
had gone to Hammonton to visit the Putiris. 
Brian was the 
photographer sent to illustrate Mark Duvoisin's article, and he 
was hoping for some fieldwork shots. Tom Carroll had arranged to 
spend the day with Bob Hanley of the New York Times, first 
visiting Ken (?) who uses one of Joe Reid's garveys to clam from, 
and then visiting Ed Hazelton, a decoy carver. 
Then he was going 
to stop back here to talk with others on the team. 
TX02: 
I took Brian on two expeditions that were basically 
errands, and both developed into fieldwork. 
The first was a trip 
to the post office, where a brief introduction to Mr. Doyle 
developed into a longer discussion of the Christmas parties that 
he held here for sixteen years, and which Sue has covered in her 
fieldnotes. 
G—New Lisbon; 21GT 
What was especially interesting to 
me was the wall 
in the back office that was plastered with 
newspaper articles about the event, and the scrap book in which 
Hufford--83 Fieldnotes 
page 38 
the event is commemorated. 
The materials record the controversy 
that developed over Mr. Doyle's hospitality. 
Eventually the 
parties grew so big that people, evidently other post masters 
among them, began to complain -- intimating that Doyle's motives 
were suspect -- he would be running for office, or worse, that he 
was robbing the till. 
People took sides in a drama that had 
something in common with How the Grinch Stole Christmas. 
To 
counter charges that he shouldn't be using government property to 
give kids a good time (he sometimes "processed" several thousand 
children through there), 
people offered him the use of their 
yards, even of their municipal buildings. 
He stuck to his guns, 
however, and eventually came out on top of everything. 
TX03: 
Then we went to Landys' home and workshop in G—Nesco; 12GT. 
Leo was wrapping grapevine. 
Wreaths of various sizes hung in 
clusters from the ceiling of his shop. 
Opened pine cones were 
spread out on a screen through which the seed was sifted, 
evidently for sale to reforestation projects. 
Both he and Hazel 
seemed glad to see us, and while Leo took Brian around to show 
him a few things in the operation, Hazel talked to me -- about 
her own health, which has had its ups and downs, and about other 
things as well. 
She furnished some interesting details about 
animal deaths -- some funeral practices associated with pets, 
conducted for the sake of a distressed grandchild. 
The first 
animal was a pigeon, the second a family dog. 
The grandchild 
buried her own snapshot with the pet, and Hazel spoke of plans to 
put a grave blanket there this year. 
I was surprised to learn 
that both Hazel and Leo belong to a chapter of the American 
Prisoners of War Association. 
She spoke of the years of 
occasional trauma experienced by men who were prisoners. 
We were about to leave when I realized that Leo was making 
bread, a six—hour procedure which he takes charge of 
in that 
household. 
For the sake of a chance to document this, we decided 
to stay for lunch. 
Brian took a number of photos for us on this 
occasion, including shots of Leo carving the ham for lunch. 
TX04: 
Shortly after I returned, 
Bob Hanley showed up. 
He'd had 
a good day with Tom, but he wanted to discuss Pineys, and what 
we'd discovered in that vein. 
Despite efforts that Joseph, Jens 
and I made to convince him that this term is not altogether 
useful, and that it 
is based on a stereotype that we can't 
subscribe to as researchers, he continued to ask questions like 
"Are you going to visit any Pineys tomorrow?" 
I actually invited 
him to visit Vernon ("Pudgy") and Margaret ("Liz") Bakely with 
Carl and I, but he had to be back in New York for a conference 
with his daughter's kindergarten teacher. 
He's returning 
tomorrow. 
Meanwhile, the background on this interview.

This is to summarize conversations I had with George 
Campbell G—Eldora, 34GT, George Brewer (and Leroy Creamer) 
G—Dennisville, 34GT, and Tom Brown G—Millville, 38GT, on April 7. On 
April 8 I visited Joe Reid G—Waretown, 53GT Jack Cervetto G—Warren 
Grove, 56GT, 
and Clifford Frazee G—Forked River, 49GT. 
On April 7 
I also sat in on a class in the ongoing Folk—Artists—in—Education 
program in Cumberland County, conducted by Rita Moonsammy. The 
purpose of the interviews was to obtain information for an 
article on the Pinelands Folklife Project for the Folklife 
Annual. 
TX01: G—Eldora, 34GT 
I drove to Eldora with Rita Moonsammy, who is 
coordinating a folklife exhibit on the Pinelands National 
Reserve, 
in order to interview George Campbell, a salt hay farmer 
who is featured in the article. 
Rita welcomed the chance to meet 
him, since he may be featured in the exhibit as well. 
I wanted 
to get a clearer picture in my mind of the shape that a salt hay 
meadow has 
in the mind of a salt—hay farmer, and to understand 
what some of the geometric lines are in the aerial slides we have 
of the salt marshes. 
Keeping salt hay dry is essential, so salt— 
hay farmers ditch the meadows to drain them. 
The mosquitoes that 
thrive in stagnant water grow in the ditches. 
Before the great 
hurricane of 1950 they regulated the sea water by letting it 
in 
and out through sluices. 
They didn't have to bank and ditch 
because there were natural banks between the meadows and the bay, 
and the tides weren't as high. 
That hurricane wiped out the 
bank. He didn't remember the name of the hurricane. 
Since then 
they've had to artificially dike the bayfronts. 
An insidious 
side effect of the hurricane was the introduction of Phragmites 
(plant) also called foxtails, which indicate diseased marshland. The 
difference between the bank maintenance practiced by salt—hay 
farmers and muskrat (animal) trappers is that salt—hay farmers keep 
the water out, and muskrat trappers keep it 
in. 
The sluice boxes 
in the creeks, Campbell said, are made of corrugated pipe and a 
f 
I 
apper. 
As far as the salt—hay farmer is concerned, muskrat trapping 
functions as a kind of pest control, since muskrats destroy the 
banks. 
They encourage the presence of foxes because the foxes 
Hufford--84 Fieldnotes 
page 40 
eat the muskrats. 
There are some real traditional old foxhunters 
on Delsea Drive, Campbell said, who hunt mostly red fox. 
Grays 
seem to prefer the woods. 
The foxhunters use mostly Walkers. 
Campbell scrutinized the aerial that I showed in the slide 
presentation (PFP83—CJC046-03), and declared that it 
is not a 
salt—hay meadow. 
The hexagonal shapes, he said, are salt ponds, 
for killy fish to 
live 
in so that they can eat the mosquito 
larva. 
The ponds and ditches are maintained by the Mosquito 
Control Commission. 
In our aerial there's a little too much 
water, and not enough evidence of diking. 
That's how Campbell 
knows it isn't a salt—hay meadow. 
The meadows are made into 
squares to facilitate harvesting. 
The pieces run from 10 acres 
to 50 in size. 
Anything smaller than 5 acres wouldn't be worth 
the trouble. 
So, I conclude, they are for the most part larger 
than the average cranberry bog. 
Campbell says that three miles 
from the bay 
is about as far away as a salt—hay meadow can thrive. 
Aerial maps, based on aerial photos taken by the 
Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service of the U.S. 
department of Agriculture (P.O. Box 30010, Salt Lake City, Utah, 
84130 
(801)524-5856), are obtainable locally from the Soil 
Conservation Department in Seabrook. 
The Campbells and Coxes 
have their meadows along the banks of West Creek. 
You can pick 
up bombshells all over the meadows, and there are airplanes in 
the bottoms of the salt ponds, because the army used to practice 
dogfighting over the meadows during WWII. 
There are no magazines for salt—hay farmers, and no 
associations. 
Salt hay was grown at one time in Connecticut, 
Staten Island, and California, although the West Coast doesn't 
move gradually enough into the ocean. 
Campbell continually 
explores the meadows for the history deposited there, natural as 
well as cultural. 
The ocean is not claiming the meadows, but 
reclaiming them -- since 360 feet down there are oyster shells. 
"Our lifetimes don't mean that much to the larger cycle," he 
concluded. 
"A thousand years ago this was all under water." And 
over by Port Norris, where he 
is digging up cedar stumps, the 
reverse appears to be true. 
He remembers men digging them up for 
shakes (shingles) 
in the meadows up the Maurice River. 
I asked Campbell about the statement I'd read in Wilson's 
account of the cedar mining -- 
(Harold Wilson, The Jersey Shore: 
A Social and Economic History of the Counties of Atlantic, Cape 
May, Monmouth and Ocean, vol. II, p. 725) that the cedar miner 
would secure a chip from the submerged tree with his "progue" 
(colloquial for probe -- is this related to the term "proger" 
used interchangeably with mudwalloper to describe a person who 
lives off of the meadows? -- Anyway, the miner could determine 
from the smell of the chip whether the tree was a breakdown --
which had broken off at the trunk -- or a windfall, with its 
roots still attached. Apparently breakdowns were easier to mine. 
How could they tell by the smell? 
Campbell has a theory -- the 
Hufford--84 Fieldnotes 
page 41 
one that blew down would still have sap 
in 
it. 
The one that 
broke would lose it, 
like blood going out of a chicken after its 
head was out off. 
Why there are no salt—hay farmers' associations: 
"We're an 
individual bunch of coots!" 
He had used the term "beautiful hay" with Jens Lund. 
What 
exactly is beautiful hay? I asked him. 
Beautiful hay 
is dry, 
long, and yellow, and not caked. 
Owen Carney had to have long 
"rope" hay. 
"Hotbed" hay had to be 
long because it had to be 
rehandled for sweet potatoes and early seedbeds. 
He retold the 
anecdote recorded by Lund, about the insulating value of salt 
hay. 
He found ice crystals in a clump of it one time in June. 
(See Lund's Rlogs). 
"Short" hay 
is good for cement work or 
derrick work. 
[aesthetics, taxonomy] 
There is aristocracy all over the region it seems. 
Campbell 
wants to put in a camp ground on some of his Maurice River 
property, and Wheaton is opposing. 
CAFRA regulations required 
Campbell to have an archaeological sample taken. 
He was going 
to court that night to try to get his campground approved. 
Catering to tourists is a way of drawing an 
income 
in case the 
salt hay fails him. 
TX02: 
G—Dennisville, 34GT We stopped for about a half hour at 
George Brewer's place in Dennisville, to give him some copies of 
the Folklife Center News, containing an article about cedar 
culture in South Jersey, and to ask a few questions. On the way 
up on the train I had jotted down some areas for questioning: 
1) The distribution of corduroy roads 
2) The types and varieties of bottoms 
3) Smells, for example, that example of the windthrows 
smelling different than the breakdowns 
4) Different kinds of cedar: the difference between what 
gets called Juniper, Jersey, and Southern Cedar 
5) 
Prescriptive materials in existence for these various 
land and resource managers we're interviewing 
6) Cedar music 
Brewer and Creamer were getting ready to go to the sawmill 
which is close by -- within earshot of the house. 
They appeared 
to be rather shy at first, but, as often happens, when we began 
to 
leave, they became gregarious. 
Brewer pointed out that in the 
last century corduroy roads had to be built especially tightly in 
order to keep the feet of horses and oxen from falling into the 
cracks. 
This attitude may be connected with the contrast between 
Brewer's road and Frazee's road, evident in the photographs. 
Brewer's roads function to get the bulldozer through the swamp. 
Frazee would later on criticize Jan Adler's drawing in the 
newsletter, in which the slabs were placed too far apart. 
Frazee 
has a penchant for neatness, which he elaborated on in our 
conversation the following day. 
Pole roads were also built on 
Hufford--84 Fieldnotes 
page 42 
salt hay meadows, and involved mixing in some gravel. 
There was 
a real art to building the road so a horse could go over it, 
Brewer said. 
The builder was paid by the rod. 
We also 
discussed the cedar mining. 
Brewer speculated that the swamps 
could have been buried when a big comet knocked them down. 
The 
real question, as far as he's concerned, 
is how did the cedars 
fall down and get covered over all 
at once? 
Independence Hall 
in 
Philadelphia is covered with "dug", or mined shingles, and his 
brother has a cabinet built out of them. 
Brewer has supplied Joe 
Reid with cedar planking for his garveys, and Van Sant with the 
same for lifeguard boats, and, I discovered later, Harry Shourds 
buys from him as well. 
Northern Cedar, according to Brewer, grows in Maine. 
Southern Cedar is what we have here. 
Juniper, he said, does not 
grow here. He said that there are two kinds of red cedar: 
1) 
Aromatic, and 2) the poles from the Garden State Parkway. 
He 
said that Jersey southern cedar is different from North Carolina 
southern cedar, 
in that in NC the grain grows closer together. 
As we were leaving he showed us a piece of mined cedar, 
remarking that you can see the shingle was done by hand because 
the cut isn't true. 
He suggested that Charlie Pomlear is the 
kind of Piney that we might want to go and visit. 
(Jens already 
has). 
He told a story illustrating the shyness of Pineys, about 
travellers being able to see kids playing in the road from a 
distance, who disappear by the time the traveller gets to the 
spot where they were playing. 
TX03: G—Millville, 38GT 
Tom Brown, who has been photographed by 
both Joseph Czarnecki and Dennis McDonald, and interviewed by 
Eugene Hunn (see Gene's fieldnotes for October), 
is 
in his second 
year of participating in the Folk—Artists—in—Education program in 
Cumberland County, which Rita Moonsammy is directing. 
The day 
was gray, rainy, and cold, and both Tom and Muriel were 
housebound and seemed glad for our company. 
He has begun working 
in his garden, and plans to have onions, potatoes, radishes, 
corn, tomatoes, pole beans, beans, jonquils, daffodils, tulips, 
gladiolis, aster, amaryllis, cosmos, zinnias, and coleus, at 
least. 
He has built a wishing well and various stone pathways 
into his garden, 
in which a poem is mounted on a jagged piece of 
wood: "Here in my garden I spend many an hour/ Watching my 
vegetables and my flowers/ The Lord sends the sunshine and the 
showers/ Here I relax and rest/ and enjoy peace and happiness." 
He recited it for us, along with other poems he's written and 
memorized. 
The one he wrote on the occasion of his fiftieth 
anniversary was both amusing and moving. There is a rosebush in 
their garden that is exactly as old as their marriage. 
It's an 
American Beauty Rose. 
Roses, he said, are the hardest to grow. 
Tom grew the asters that were in his daughter's wedding basket. 
In 1946 he planted a lot of flowers for the grave of his three— 
year—old daughter, Doris Marie. 
His brother—in—law wrote a 
letter to him at that point, giving him a metaphor that helped 
Hufford--84 Fieldnotes 
page 43 
him to resolve the pain he had. "When you cut a limb out of the 
center of a tree," wrote the brother—in—law, "it leaves a scar, 
and the tree grows over it eventually so that you can't see 
it, 
but the scar never goes away." 
We were talking about the power of smell to evoke memory, 
and he said that kerosene does that for him sometimes, reminding 
him of the kerosene lanterns under the seats of old horse—drawn 
school busses. 
They are both fond of recalling the old 
technology. Muriel, for example, canned food over a wood fire in 
the early years of their marriage. 
She still cans, because, she 
said pointing to a can of tomatoes, "When you get to look at 
things all year like this, it;s worth it." 
Now, even though she 
could freeze things, she continues to can because "I got a 
husband that likes to see things. 
It's pretty in the can." 
Tom enjoys his grandchildren. 
To his grandson Bucky he sent 
a fox picture, one piece at a time, with a verse for each one. 
He taught Bucky how to hunt. 
His father was 57 when Tom was 
born, and he 
is 
in his 70s. 
The father was eight or nine years 
old during the civil war, and passed his memories of 
it along to 
Tom. There were five children in the family, and his father used 
to hold them all 
in his 
lap and sing civil war songs to them, 
songs like "Tramping Through Georgia." His mother, who was part 
Indian, gathered sassafras root, teaberry leaves, jimson weed 
(inhale the smoke from the leaves for asthma), plantain leaves 
for application against poison from sumac, poison ivy, ground 
oak, wild asparagus. 
He 
is, of course, a trapper. 
Red foxes are the most 
difficult to catch. 
The same set you make for a red will catch a 
gray. 
Fifty years ago there were only gray foxes in the area. 
Fox chasers, he said, brought the red fox in. 
Trappers and 
chasers are on good terms now, he said. 
Years ago 
it wasn't so 
good. It used to be 
if you lost a trap it was from a fox hunter. 
He taught one young man to tap and he caught 21 foxes the first 
year. The trick in trapping is cleanliness. 
One trapper asked 
him years ago what his secret is. Tom answered, "Remove all 
suspicion and put down a great attraction." 
Either you're a 
trapper or you're not. 
Gray fox will climb a tree. 
The foot print is cat—like. 
Red fox has a dog—like print. 
Silver fox is from the red line. 
He saw one once on Weatherby road. Not too many people see a fox 
in the wild. 
Otter and beaver are more common. 
Otter will put 
on a show for you, Tom said. 
"We heard [foxes] run rabbit at 
night -- like a puppy yippin'." 
Red fox and gray fox don't get 
along, he said, but I have caught 'em thirty yards apart. 
Coyotes'II run the fox out in the west." 
"We have coya dogs around here," he said. 
Dogs crossed with 
coyotes that weigh 44 pounds. 
Due to the dog part of them they 
have no fear, but they have beautiful fur. "They look exactly 
Hufford--84 Fieldnotes 
page 44 
like red wolves." 
There were seven of them to begin with. 
They 
caughtr two and killed them. 
Muriel: "They are wicked lookin'!" 
Tom caught an albino muskrat recently. 
drowned all the baby muskrats, so they 
which would have had young in the late 
should stop the season by the first of 
15th. 
The recent f

He thinks they 
March rather than the 
On the subject of teaching others to trap, Tom said that 
lots of trappers won't give away their secrets. 
"I was a loner, 
but I would take the time to teach a youngster," he said. 
He 
never stops learning himself, he added. "When you think you know 
it all, that's the time to quit." He keeps a log 
in which he 
enters the date, the temperatures in the morning and evening, the 
kind of fur he's taken, and where he's been. 
On the wa I 
I is a framed certificate of appreciation from the 
American Folklife Center, Library of Congress. 
"We call this place 'the little house with the large 
welcome'," he said as we rose to 
leave. 
TX04: 
That evening I attended a class that Rita is conducting 
for teachers in Cumberland County who want to use folk artists in 
their classrooms. 
The structure of the program is that the 
teachers apply for the money to bring in folk artists that Rita 
has documented in her fieldwork (some of them this year have 
surfaced through the Pinelands Folklife Project), and they have 
to attend classes in order to develop the presentations, and to 
integrate the artist into the curriculum. 
This particular class featured teachers who had successfully 
completed the program last year, and a potluck supper comprising 
family recipes prepared by the teachers. 
One of 
last year's 
teachers brought in a quilt made by here students. 
The appliqued 
patches included lockers, baseballs, a ms. pac man, a fishing 
hole, a house, a favorite with a swing (a memory patch from 
childhood). 
One teacher told of how he used an auctioneer for 
his math class. 
They used monopoly money and cut out items to 
sell from catalogues, with the real prices on the backs. 
They 
auctioned by ones, tens, hundreds, thousands, and then by 
fractions, to 
learn to add and multiply and economize quickly on 
their feet. 
They also acquired the auctioneer's patter. 
A number of teachers gravitated naturally toward the ethnic 
groups -- Japanese, Ukrainian, Hispanic -- which can obscure the 
folklife factor by foregrounding what's exotic. 
Folklife 
principles can be better epitomized in universally experienced 
contexts like family, region and occupation. 
The teachers were enthusiastic, and I think the model 
is the 
most viable one I've seen for making the teachers autonomous.

spend the summer making clam tong stales and working, or playing, 
in his words, with his miniatures. 
He would like to make one 
model of each kind of boat that has been used on the bay. 
He 
showed me the three models he could find. 
One had no cabin and a 
flat bottom, one had a cabin and a flat bottom, and the third and 
largest has no cabin and a V—bottom. 
I took color slides of 
these. 
Joe's nomenclature for kinds of cedar seems to be at 
variance with George Brewer's, though it agrees in part. 
Southern White Cedar is the same as Jersey Cedar, but Jersey 
Cedar is best for boats because the colder winters do something 
to 
it. 
He had a lot to say about the changes in the bay bottom. 
The seaweed changes it. Rotting grass softens the hard bottom, 
necessitating the use of different rakes, and making it easier to 
work. 
Such changes can occur in a matter of months. 
There are 
many small and unmapped channels. 
"Fishing Slough, Sammy Slough, 
Cooper Slough." 
When the grass leaves, the tide washes them 
away. 
Settin' poles help in navigating. 
You never know just 
where the grass'II stay and where it'll move. 
Where the grass 
lays 
it brings the clams up, so instead of 
laying at the bottom 
they have to come up. 
The sloughs were often named for the people who found them 
and the old clammers respected each other's spots. 
There have been a lot of changes in garveys since Joe's 
boyhood, and he admits that he's responsible for a lot of them. 
They used to be pretty much like boxes. 
They had no keels. 
With 
keels you have to pay attention to channels, but they can carry 
more sail. 
The main channel was marked in the bay: "Inland 
Waterway" it was called. 
Near developments they'll maintain 
their own channels. 
The changes in garveys have affected the 
Hufford--84 Fieldnotes 
page 46 
shapes and the look. 
Reid laminates the keel where it used to be 
cut out, he said. 
He has flared the verticals where the old ones 
were straight—sided. 
He built his first boat in 1936. 
About ten 
years ago ha started building boats full time. 
In between he was 
busy clamming. 
Boat building made for good work 
in his 
retirement from clamming, because it was easier. 
Now at 74 <?) 
that's beginning to prove strenuous. 
So he's beginning to build models. 
He thinks it's easier to 
go from the big boats to the models than to go from the models to 
the big boats -- so for him the models are not a way of studying 
the boat in order to internalize it or gain conceptual control over 
it. 
"You have to know how to make the big ones first," he 
said. 
"I hope to make one of each kind." That would include 
garveys, sharpies, dories, V—bottoms, flat—bottoms, bateaux, and 
sea—going -- small charter boats. 
Make a fleet of each kind. He 
doesn't need plans. 
He 
likes to talk with the older people for their memories. 
Rudolph Camburn, at 89, 
is one of Joe's favorites. 
Camburn 
actually raised Sam Hunt. 
The last sailing garvey in the bay was 
built by Joe's father, and ended up as a chicken coop in 
Camburn's back yard. 
John Reid (Joe's father) was a sailmaker 
from Aberdeen, Scotland. 
He worked on a square—rigger. 
In 1856 
he was shipwrecked off of Barnegat, and he married Mary Penn. Joe 
visited Aberdeen during the war, but gave up trying to find his 
father's fami ly. 
Buck's Channel was named after "Old Man Buck Ridgway." 
Buck 
died 40 years ago. He showed me a book written by Bob Sims that 
has some good pictures of old tools: Pages from the Past of Rural 
New Jersey Published by the New Jersey Agricultural society in 
1949. He 
is also  fond of the Foxf ire series. 
This 
is how Sammy's Slough got its name.

This method of reckoning is not to be confused with another that 
is called Triangulation (or "Apple Tree Navigation" as Rita 
Moonsammy reports it 
is called on the Delaware Bay)

Joe lamented the changing landmarks, brought with development, 
that have sabotaged this method of reckoning. 
He seemed pleased with the newsletters I gave him, and with his 
photograph on the front cover. 
TX02: G—Warren Grove, 56GT 
Drove to Warren Grove, following my 
visit with Joe Reid, and stopped in at the luncheonette there to 
inquire where Jack and Pearl Cervetto live. Was told, to a chorus 
of snickers that they have a house on the left with a large lake 
in the front (due to the wetness of the past few days). 
Jack received the newsletters happily enough, and spoke of 
an interview he'd had recently with a camera crew. 
I think it 
may have been Bill Teitler's operation. 
He didn't completely 
approve of our drawing of the corduroy road, and lapsed into an 
account of them. 
They used to build corduroy roads 20 rods apart 
(meaning that you can find one every 20 rods 
in the woods) and 
they were paid two cents a rod. 
The crossways themselves were 8 
feet wide. 
There were three basic supports, called "dead men" --
one on each side and one in the middle. 
Eight foot poles were 
built across the top. 
As the road would settle the the mud would 
Hufford--84 Fieldnotes 
page 48 
e
fill 
it 
in and seal the poles together. 
Some of the crossways 
are still 
in good shape. 
"All the crossways lead to Candlewood," 
was an old, well—known saying. 
Candlewood is three miles north 
of Warren Grove -- there's a little creek there, and 
it was the 
first sawmill 
in the area, according to Cervetto. 
Jack claims to be the third white man to cut the Oswego 
Swamp. 
"It takes a hundred years to get it near right. 
They use 
the same corduroy roads over again." 
Cervetto has sold a lot of 
cedar to Joe Reid. 
As far as controlling the water levels in cedar management, 
Cervetto just has to keep an eye on what the cranberry growers 
are up to. 
The cranberry grower three miles west of him, he 
said, sometimes holds the water too high. 
Each cedar has a 
hassock around it, from 8 to 12 inches high, and 
if the water 
gets above the hassock, 
it kills the cedar. 
The hassock is a 
natural entanglement of roots around the cedar, and it's where 
the moss (sphagnum) grows, and where the moss can be hung to dry 
when it's harvested. 
Types of swamp. 
There are hard bottom swamps, with islands 
and sloughs. 
In dry bottom swamps the cedar grows without 
hassocks. 
He said that male cedars are red and hard and that female 
cedars are white and soft. 
"Naturally the man is 
tougher," he laughed. 
"No comment," said Pearl. 
Types of bottom. 
There is oak bottom, pine bottom, gum 
bottom, maple bottom, cedar bottom. 
The bottoms change rapidly 
all over the Plains. 
In the South Plains every hill has a 
different material to it. 
One is a gravel hill, another has 
sugar sand, another ordinary sand, and some are solid rock. 
They 
have names too -- like Hogback Hill, Skunk Hill, (John) Bacon's 
Ridge, and Bear Swamp Hill. 
Some swamps are only 100 feet wide, and some are 600 feet 
wide. 
Oswego Swamp is 1000 feet wide. 
It starts at Coffin Board 
Hollow. 
Oswego Lake was built by the Civilian Conservation Corp 
boys for a recreation area. 
There are very few hardwood swamps, 
Cervetto said. 
They have some maple and bull pine mixed in. 
Along the edge of every swamp is a variety of species of plants 
-- a hundred before it goes into the wet part. 
Magnolia, gum, 
maple, huckleberry -- for 30 to 50 feet. 
He took a Pinelands Commission girl 
into a swamp that was 
almost all 
islands. 
On the islands there's no hassocks and the 
top 
is dry and turfy. 
There are three to four inches of mass 
roots. After they got into the swamp they saw huckleberries. 
Sloughs are made by springs -- self—fed streams. 
In the swamp 
there's no mosquitoes, and that's where the best blueberries 
grow. 
Mosquitoes don't like the sphagnum smell. 
There's a kind 
of medication in 
it. 
Hufford--84 Fieldnotes 
page 49 
The old—timers all used to watch the fire index -- that is, 
they would continually check the condition of the leaves, to see 
how crumbly they were. 
"After the rain you don't have to worry 
for two weeks, but when the ground is dry underneath he wouldn't 
go too far from home. 
The old—timers used to worry every spring 
about getting the burning done. 
Now he can't get a permit to 
burn his brush. 
The Pinelands Commission is more worried about 
polluting the air than about the fire hazard. 
It's no longer 
possible to burn off the ground in anticipation of fires. 
On the subject of the difference in smell between windthrows 
and breakdowns he had little to say. 
He's gotten good solid 
cedar under streams. 
"Chances are the broken off cedar would be 
better than a blown—over one," he said. 
Trees that rot in water: 
Birch, bum, black oak, pine. 
Trees that don't rot: White oak, cedar. 
What the water—checker does: 
Until the time the cranberry 
blooms, the checker makes sure the water is drained out. Dory 
Holloway, Pearl's brother, checks the water at Sim Place. 
"He'll 
go to sleep on a cranberry dam." 
Cedar music: "In freezing weather when the wind blows and 
the dead trees lean over against the green ones it's like an 
accordian. 
And every one sounds different. 
That's the beautiful 
part." 
"The weirdest sound that I've heard in the swamp is a snake 
swallowing a frog. 
It takes a long time for a snake 
to swallow 
a frog and the whole time the frog is squeeching! 
It takes about 
15 minutes!" 
Jack's permit was taken away from him by Rick Brown, when he 
had seven people cutting firewood. 
I didn't understand the story 
here, but he was certainly agitated. 
He's appealing it. 
People have stopped him on the road when he's been cutting 
cedar. 
He's been insulted by strangers for chopping down trees. 
"We like to look at them," they say. "Well then why don't you buy 
it?" 
They were surprised by the number of foxhunters I had spoken 
with, and the people we knew in common because of 
it. 
Pearl 
pulled out a photograph (I took its picture) of her father and 
some other foxhunters. 
It had been taken in the 1940s and there 
were some women with dogs among them. 
She didn't know the names 
of the women. 
The men included Tom Mick, Clarence "Bull" 
Stafford, Hank Corlies (related to the famed Rube Corlies who 
made decoys and garveys in Manahawkin), Alfred Stevenson of 
Chatsworth, Randall "Snap" Stafford (whom I have interviewed), 
Ward Holloway, Bill Holloway (Pearl's father), and Joe Holloway. 
Pearl did not remember much about the dogs. 
One dog used 
Hufford--84 Fieldnotes 
page 50 
to be afraid of showers and had a special cave to go 
into. 
TX03: 
My third stop was at Clifford Frazee's. 
Cliff was 
finishing his dinner, so I gave them the newsletter and sat down 
at the table for a few hours. 
He thought the drawing was good, 
and had two criticisms, which are linked with matters of pride in 
his own craftsmanship when it comes to road—building. 
The 
stumps, he said, were too tall. 
They cut them off closer to the 
ground. 
That can be remedied easily for the next publication of 
the drawing. 
The slabs were placed too far apart for his liking, 
though this was for graphic reasons. 
Like Joe Reid, Cliff has a favorite old—timer to talk to. 
Zeb Collins -- somehow related to Collin's Crossway?--is full of 
good information. 
Cliff also mentioned a fellow named Arie Couch who invented 
a spacer for planting cranberry vines, by putting spikes in the 
wheel of a wheelbarrow, eight inches apart. 
He made the "trunks" 
(gates) for the cranberry bogs at Howardville, all 
out of white 
cedar and two inches thick. 
He also made barges, 20 feet long 
and ten feet wide, with shutters on them, for sanding the bogs. 
They would put the sand on two or three inches thick and trup the 
shutters, and the sand would dump out on the bog. 
That was one 
method. 
Another method involved the use of a track for carting 
the sand out and laying it on with shovels. 
Another method was 
to spread the sand out on the ice 
in the winter. 
In those days 
they had model T's with one yard jiffy dumps. 
Sanding was done 
to fertilize the bogs and encourage new growth on the vines. 
The 
government used to subsidize it. 
Clam pearls come from very old clams. 
Lucille found one in 
the muscle when she was making chowder. 
"Pugs" are very old 
clams, with big thick shells, and hard to open because you can't 
find the line to open them. 
Horsefoot Slough is right by the Sedge Island. 
There's a 
hunting lodge on Sedge Island. 
Horsefoot Slough runs between 
Sedge Island and the Lighthouse. 
There are maybe fifty waterways 
running through the bay and they're about four feet deep. 
There 
were sedge oysters growing in clusters. They were ten inches long 
and very narrow. 
Cliff would fill up a rowboat with them in no 
time. 
Frankie Penn was the greatest bayman Cliff knew. (Was he related to 
Joe Reid's mother, Mary Penn?) 
He died 15 years ago. 
He caught clams and oysters and set fykes for flounders. 
He'd 
skull the rowboat and break the ice by rocking the boat. 
A 
flounder is a bottom fish. 
One of the best eating fish there is. 
It's also a winter fish. Frankie made $10 a day when everybody 
else was making nothing. 
Cliff caught seahorses and oyster fish. 
Hufford--84 Fieldnotes 
page 51 
Double Creek was/is? a marked channel. 
Mud Channel 
is also 
marked with buoys. 
Also Oyster Creek channel. 
A lot of them had 
elbows in them. 
The channel markers, made of cedar, have to be 
replaced each year, because the ice forces them out. 
There is 
soft clamming at Clam Islands. 
They have thin shells and get 
big. Cliff dug about 5 bushels a day. 
He always used a flat— 
bottom garvey, twenty—five feet long, with a tunnel 
in 
it, 
so 
that the wheel 
(of the propeller) would be drawn up into the 
boat, and thus not hinder the boat's passage through shallow 
waters. 
Sometimes people could get stranded on the bar. 
Ed 
Parker ("Big Ed") could go where no one else could go. 
There 
was usually a bar across the mouth of the slough. 
The Crossover 
was a place to jump over the flats. You can get a map from the 
Department of Navigation. 
You need a tunnel boat to get around 
in the bay. 
Most boats draw three feet of water, and a tunnel 
boat draws a foot and a half. 
There are parallels in the woods to those channels in the 
bay. 
There are branches -- those fingers of Cedar Creek and 
Forked River, and the saturated places called spongs. 
Branches: 
Stonehill Branch, Seabrook Branch, North Branch and its branches 
-- Sprague Branch and Flag Branch, and Cave Cabin Branch. 
Marcus Brown is an old guy who used to foxhunt, likewise 
Hayes Britton. 
Cliff's grandmother used to see bears when she was out 
huckleberrying. 
Bamber used to be Cedar Crest and Fargo. Party 
boats fished on the shellbeds which all had names to them. 
Cliff 
was employed staking out the channels in the bay and the major 
rivers: Egg Harbor, the Mullica, Toms River. 
He worked with a 
five—man crew -- one ran the boat, another man had a sounding 
stick, another one pumped the holes, another put in the stakes 
and another held the wheel. 
From 1949 to 1960 he worked on a 
buoy tender. 
In wintertime the buoys had to be replaced with 
spars, because the ice would cover the buoys. 
Spars marked where 
the light poles should go. Cliff's uncle ran across the 
ice 
in a 
Chevy one year -- in 1934 
when it was 17 degrees below zero, the 
coldest weather in Cliff's lifetime. 
Fred Grant kept the 
temperature records. 
He lives right on Cedar Creek and worked on 
the bay all his life. 
Regarding the problem of windfalls vs. breakdowns, Cliff 
commented that the stump that was attached would be older. 
A 
hurricane could lay a cedar swamp flat. 
Ed Britton found a log 
that was cut in 1900 but it was too big for them to handle. 
Water eroding the roots away will also cause the trees to fall 
over.

bay, as seen from the shore:

Cliff has a mockingbird that comes around when he cuts wood, for 
the worms. 
Local people are quite upset with the motorcyclists, Cliff 
said. 
They make the roads washboardy and impassable. 
People 
have taken matters into their own hands, string wires across 
roads -- which resulted in the tragic loss of a local girl's life 
-- and putting spikes in the road. 
Hazelton got three flat tires 
that way. 
Cliff suggests that they stick to the firebreaks and 
not use the roads that people need to work on. 
Cliff predicts a lot of forest fires this year, due lack of 
forestry staff to get the control burning done. 
On Tuesday there 
was a big forest fire. 
When there are no leaves on the trees the 
sun dries everything out quicker. 
Lucille thinks we should get Cliff and Dickie Taylor 
together. 
They've both got the Piney accent, according to her. 
Cliff doesn't know Harry Payne -- knows of him. 
Has worked with 
John Payne who 
is probably related. 
"The best woodcutter I 
knew." 
He wants us to bring a list of questions and a set of maps 
the next time. 
Sayings he 
likes: 
Hufford--84 Fieldnotes 
page 53 
"Let me 
live long enough to be a problem to my kids." 
"You never see a crow and a bluebird travel together." 
Lucille's comment on that: "But opposites attract." 
"He'd give you a cracker for a barrel of flour." 
Acton Bunne) used to say: "You can always judge a man by his 
tools." 
He lived 
in Lanoka. 
He was a character. 
Cliff latched 
onto that saying because he takes pride in keeping his work space 
neat -- he's always tidying up the swamp. 
He cited several 
boatbuilders who turn out absolutely beautiful boats but their 
work spaces and homes have suffered because of it, 
in his 
opinion. It seems as though he was discussing the opposition 
between type A and type Z personalities. 
Cliff's foot was almost totally severed when he worked with 
an axe in a fatigued state. 
He is also missing the tip of one 
finger. 
He shrugs: "When you work with a blade and you use 
it 
thousands of times, that's bound to happen." 
When he hurt his 
foot he was rescued by a "colored" fellow who answered his cries 
and carried him to where he could get help.

TXO1: This trip was a quick one -- I went to New Jersey on Friday 
evening, May 18, 
in order to participate in a day—long symposium 
produced by the Pinelands Commission on the history, archaeology 
and culture of the Pinelands on the following day. I spent the 
night at the home of Joanne Van Istendal, near Van Dal Lake 
in 
Marlton. 
Van Dal Lake is a lake community that was started by 
Joanne's uncle, and the houses there are the homes of two 
generations of Van Istendals. 
Joanne lives not far from her 
parents, with her four children and innumerable birds, goats, 
rabbits, a german shepherd named Christian, and whatever poor 
waifs the Fish and Game Commission send her way. 
She had custody 
of a young squirrel when I was there. 
There are no real 
roads to speak of connecting the houses --
only sand roads with tufted median strips winding about. 
In 
other words, the settlement does not have the air of a planned 
community. 
The lake was once a cranberry reservoir, and there is 
a cedar swamp right in back of the house. 
Joanne and her parents 
are being sued by a developer who was denied permission to flood 
their property 
(in order to drain off the section he wants to 
develop). 
Joanne is developing a Nature Trail through the swamp and 
woods near her house. 
All of their houses have exposed sand 
around them, for protection in case of fire. 
She has what she 
calls her formal gardens in the front of the house. 
Her place, 
on the rather gray, misty day I arrived, had some of the quality 
of an enchanted house in a medieval forest. 
There was a peacock 
in full display perched on the chimney, and the others were 
crying out intermittently from the ground. 
There's one cleared 
section Joanne calls the "dancing floor", where the male peacocks 
strut around and display themselves to the females who are 
in 
cages. She spoke of the various animals she has kept for short 
periods. 
Once she had a fox, and she marvelled at its 
intelligence. 
She said it would study the behavior of small 
chicks with an awesome intensity for hours and hours. 
She knew 
Hufford--84 Fieldnotes 
page 55 
that 
if the fox were let out a chick wouldn't stand a chance 
because the fox would know its habits so well. 
Her formal gardens are enclosed by a white picket fence. 
There is some statuary there, and the fence is edged with 
flowers. 
Brick walkways criss—cross the garden, which one has to 
pass through to enter the house. 
The walkways are inlaid with 
complex symbols. 
The inlays consist of broken brick held together 
with cement. 
One walk tells a complete story, beginning 
with a butterfly on the opposite side of the sun. 
The butterfly 
is travelling, and comes to ( or through?) the tree of wisdom and 
falls in 
love with a daisy, but because the daisy 
is root bound 
(in a heart—shaped pot) and the butterfly must be free to roam, 
they can't make a life together. 
The butterfly leaves, and the 
daisy is potted in a broken heart, with hand—prints from each of 
Joanne's children and from Joanne herself coming out of each 
petal 
Exotic birds are like money, according to Joanne, among the 
local people. 
She gained some acceptance with the old man at 
Friendship bogs (?) who told her the snapping turtle anecdote she 
recounted at the end of our meeting with Elizabeth Woodford et al 
in November -- when she began trading in exotic birds with him. 
She commented on an 
irony behind the releasing of wild animals 
into the woods around there. 
A woman who keeps a wildlife refuge 
cares for sick and wounded animals, and then releases them into 
the woods. 
But animals like raccoons and hawks no sooner leave 
her house than they turn to the garbage cans and chicken coops of 
the neighbors. 
A raccoon, facing the prospect of 
life 
in the 
wilderness, says, 
"I think I'll just go down the road a—ways 
here, to Joanne's and Doreen's and..." 
The symposium on Saturday was interesting. Michele Byers and 
Frank Bannish gave a presentation on Whitesbog. 
Michele works 
for ANJEC (Association of New Jersey Environmental Councils) and 
lives 
in Suningive, the former home of Elizabeth White at 
Whitesbog, named for a Swiss Chalet. 
Many of her slides were 
furnished by Bill Bolger, who did the historic survey of 
Whitesbog. 
I gave the slide presentation that we showed at the 
congressional briefing. 
Though the symposium was not well— 
attended, Joanne came, and I told her I would welcome her honest 
response. 
As someone who has grown up there, and who 
is working 
on the interpretive committee, and who takes an 
interest in the 
local culture, her perspective is valuable. 
Several days after I 
returned to Washington, 
laden with a blue—crowned conure she 
"loaned" me, I received the following letter from her: 
23 May, 1984 
Dear Mary, 
Hufford--84 Fieldnotes 
page 56 
Thanks for your visit, we all enjoyed it. 
the movie and 
wine were real treats. 
Darral and I are pleased you are giving 
the "bird" a loving home. 
You asked me what I thought about your slide presentation on 
the Pine Barrens. 
Frankly, 
it was the best I've ever seen but 
perhaps the feelings, the oneness with the land could be a little 
stronger. 
Perhaps "the common denominator of the sand and water 
should be emphasized more 
in dominating the cultural aspects of 
the environment. 
No matter where the settlement or the culture, 
we are ALL linked together by the sand and water. 
The operations 
are small and traditional usually because it's all 
the pressure 
the 
land can take. 
The cedars can't be hurried, the seasons 
can't be changed: We all must follow the seasonal rounds and look 
forward to them. 
The old timers don't live here to be rich, 
it's more 
important not to be bothered or rushed and above all 
to have the 
peace of freedom, money, 
if you have too much, buys the things 
you don't need. 
There's a lot of tradin, 
if you want to make 
friends, an honest trade means a lot. 
A good hunting dog's about as important as anything. 
Besides companionship, 
it helps provide food, fun, and shows you 
what's around. 
the hunts give hours of good storytelling 
afterwards. 
the dogs are usually disciplined better than the 
kids. A good fox hound will 
let a deer jump over him and keep on 
running true to scent. 
A friend of mine had a rabbit hound that 
would run a rabbit til 
the darn thing would jump in his arms, 
just to get away from that persistent dog! 
As far as I'm concerned, 
living in the Pines is a little 
like living on a ship at sea, the movement of the seasons, the 
water, and the sands becomes a part of you, you don't realize it 
until you go out of the place. 
You have to learn to ride the waves, like droughts and 
fires, and above all 
respect them. The sand can eat away at you 
if you try to change it. 
You can only exploit from her what 
she'll give you, and when. 
If you try to change the land it will 
fight you, and usually win! 
When she's ready to burn, the wind will dry her like a bone, 
you gotta feel and smell the wind, be ready for a good fight. 
When there's a fire at the other end of the Pines, we all feel 
it, 
it's always on our minds, 
it binds us together. 
The sands like the sea too, 
it keeps moving and filtering, 
trying to purify itself. 
If you learn to live with its vastness, 
it gives you a sense of security, of something greater than 
ourselves.

I drove to New Jersey on Saturday morning with Harry Byrd 
in tow. 
Harry is the blue—crowned conure that Joanne and Darryl 
Van Istendal gave to me on my visit there in May. 
He 
looked 
askance for most of the first half of the trip, and then settled 
down to enjoy an apple for the rest of 
it. 
We arrived at Olga's 
Diner at the appointed hour of 11:30, and waited for Gene Hunn to 
meet us 
in the parking lot. 
When he did, we drove in my car to 
Joanne's home at Van Dal 
lake -- 
in the heart of the Pinelands 
lake district, south of Taunton Lakes, 
in the town of Marlton. 
The name of the lake economizes on the family name, and only Van 
Istendals have settled there. 
Darryl fixed us grilled cheese sandwiches, and conducted 
Gene on a tour of the aviary (my term) annexed to the back of the 
house -- it's actually a converted porch. 
Everywhere in that 
house and in the yard the eye lights on something of 
interest, 
that prompts easy inquiry. 
From the dining room table near a big 
old cast iron stove one can see the tree house through the large 
picture window. 
A ramshackle affair wedged between the four 
secondary shoots of a chestnut oak (quercus prinus), 
it contrasts 
with the tiny schoolhouse Joanne had installed for her children 
over by the bird pens. One lapstraked cedar wall 
in the dining 
area was salvaged by Joanne from a building in ruins, and 
is 
decorated with taxidermic specimens -- as are many other corners 
throughout the house. 
Swans, a snowy owl, blue jays, squirrels, 
and the like, all 
of them stuffed and mounted by Joanne. 
She 
is rehabilitating a kestral (sparrow hawk) now for the 
fish and game commission, 
in addition to the squirrel (whose name 
escapes me at the moment) that was there in May. 
The squirrel 
is 
quite tame and galloped into the room while we were sitting at 
the table. 
She 
is being sued by a developer who would have to flood her 
land 
in order to develop his, and she is blocking him. 
One inch 
of flooding, she maintains, would kill the existing vegetation. 
Though the developer says it 
is swampland, she pointed out that 
pitch pine grows in the contested area, asking "Whoever heard of 
Hufford--84 Fieldnotes 
page 58 
pitch 
pine growing in a swamp?" 
The developer has harassed her 
on several occasions, and has succeeded in 
legally closing one of 
the access roads to her property, 
in addition to filing charges 
against her for trimming the vegetation along the road, as she 
has always done. 
We went for a tour of her yard and a nature trail that she 
is developing through the swamp behind her house. 
A sign that 
says "Van Dal Lake" marks the spot where you turn off from 
Tuckerton M 
Road. 
You drive through the woods on a narrow sand 
road for half—a—mile or so, passing a large field on your left, 
which they call the Horse Field, where her father pastures a few 
horses and cows. 
At a fork in the road two signs direct you to 
her parents' house, and to "Joanne's" (the latter sign 
is 
decorated with flowers). 
When her house comes into view, the 
road splits into a circular driveway, creating an island which 
she calls the teardrop, because of 
its shape. As she described 
her plans for cultivating it further I realized how carefully 
landscaped it 
is. 
The front end of 
it 
is lined with large chunks 
of bog iron, that define that area, and that to her truly 
represent the area in a broader sense, being related to the bog 
iron industry at Taunton Forge that comprises a historical 
backdrop for the land use there. The teardrop is a transitional 
spot, she told us, between the house and the woods. 
There are 
holly and yucca plants growing there (yuccas are aka century 
plants). 
There are some iris planted there, which require 
special attention, because the sand tends to suck everything down 
-- you can plant bulbs one year, she said, and the next year you 
will 
be unable to find them. 
One year she and her father planted 
daffodils in the basins of chestnut oak trees, as a way of 
keeping the sand from getting the bulbs. 
They came up, she said, 
for four years. In the bowl of a chestnut oak 
in the teardrop is 
a crop of teaberries. 
Goat's Rue (aka wild sweet peas and 
Tephrosia Virginiana) grows in the teardrop. There is a long 
bench in the teardrop, where Joanne comes to sit to get partially 
away from it all. She is developing the place as one of her 
sanctuaries, and her criterion as she adds to or subtracts from 
it 
is that "it has to hug me. That's this spot. 
That's what this 
is for." 
Just beyond the teardrop the road merges again, 
into a path 
to her front gate. 
It passes between two gardens that frame the 
walk, and that are framed themselves by rock walls. 
Inside the 
gate, completely fenced in on four sides, 
is her formal garden, 
described in the fieldnotes of 5/19/84.
