The Coons Around Our Block. 
BANJO SOLO. 
JAMES D. ROOME'S latest hit. 
Written for him by J. M . 
TURNER. 
Copyrighted by A. J. FISHER, 1879. 
If you've been vaccinated, take a 
walk with me to-night, 
I'll show you where the niggers and the Irish had a 
fight. 
You see old nigger Johnson hit McCarthy with a 
rock, 
Because McCarthy's kids were singing " Niggers on our block." 
The Fagans slugged he Johnsons, and the Johnson's they 
slugged back, 
And razors and shillalies were used by white and black. 
The blood flowed free'as water, and it looked just like a 
dock 
Where they whipped the gang of niggers, who were living on 
our block. 
CHORUS. 
Little Sally Dusenbury crying with the croup, 
Trying to'pick her teeth with a 
brown stone stoop, 
Rise, Sally Bounce, wipe your eyes out with a 
rock, 
Go tie an anchor round your neck, and then jump off the dock. 
You can hear them in the summer and the winter just the same 
The cross-eyed, spavined, red haired, hump backed, blind, the 
halt and lame; 
They form in long procession, and they march down to 
the dock, 
The Rigs and whites singing 'bout the " Niggers on our block.' 
It's ' nough to drive one crazy, they've nearly got me mad, 
They average ninety young ones to just about one dad ; 
The mother, too, is busy, for she's adding to the flock 
-0 
join the army singing bout the " Niggers on our block." 
CHORUS. 
Little Sally Dead- eye sittinR• in the sun, 
Crying and weeping for her daddy number one. 
Rise, Sally, rise, wipe your eyes out with your sock, 
You ain't the only kid who has no daddy on the block.

Accidents will Happen to the Best of Families 
BANJO SOLO. 
Written by J. M. 
TURNER for BILLY CARTER. 
It's hard to get a 
subject for a 
song that's not been sung, 
But I'll do my best to sing one, boys, although I've lost a 
lung. 
We've given the workingman a 
chance to strike for better pay, 
And let the poor ' longshoreman work for ninety cents a 
day. 
(Sym.) 
Our noble flag has long been waved o'er land and over sea, 
Our hands are joined with Erin's sons, so Holland will be free. 
But my subject here will please you, think of it as you please, 
'Tis accidents will happen to the best of fami—lees. 
(Sym.) 
Last night I 
took a 
little walk, a 
policeman did me spy, 
And said for breaking of the peace, I'd go with him or die. 
At first I 
made objections, but his club my head did squeeze, 
For accidents will happen to the best of fami—lees. 
(Sym.) 
The other night a 
pretty girl met me upon the street, 
She said if I 
would see her home, for wine she would stand treat. 
I 
said, you'll please excuse me, miss, it is'nt just the cheese, 
For accidents will happen to the best of fami—lees. 
(Sym.) 
In Brooklyn lives a 
preacher, known as Henry W. B., 
Who with a 
lamb belonging to his flock made rather free. 
He'd saved some trouble, if he thought, while sitting on 
her knees, 
That accidents have happened to the best of fami—lees. 
(Sym.) 
So all young men a 
warning take, keep my advice in mind, 
To always leave the girls alone, and never go it blind; 
Or you will find out some sad day, there's trouble in the breeze, 
For accidents will happen to the best of fami—lees. 
(Sym.) 
Just Say a 
Kind Word when you Can. 
As sung by JoE J. DOWLING in his Drama of" Long-fingered Jack." 
Music by KING SARBRO. 
Libretto by J. M. 
TURNER. 
In this world of trouble, how many there are, 
With grief lying sad at their hearts, 
Who silently strive their deep sorrows to hide, 
While writhing with agony's dart. 
A 
small word of kindness will cheer up the heart 
And soften affliction's hard ban, 
So give them your hand and assist them along, 
And bestow a 
kind word when you can. 
CHORUS. 
So say a 
kind word whereso'er you may go, 
Its music ' tis sweet to impart, 
'Tis blessed to give, for it banishes care 
From the weary and o'erburdened heart. 
A 
word spoken kindly wilt enter the heart, 
Ana ne'er be fiaced by long years, 
This life is so short, why should we cause pain, 
Or eyes to 
-loistened with tears. 
A 
word spoken kindly costs naught to bestow, 
'Twill force a 
new life in a 
man, 
So if you would lighten the burden of life, 
Just say a 
kind word when you can. 
So say a 
kind word, &c, 
A 
wo/d roughly spoken will ne'er be forgot, 
As over life's pathway we tread, 
So think how much misery and woe can be spared, 
If kind words are uttered .r,7tead. 
If you wish to give friend_nip, be welcomed with smiles, 
Remember this: Act liko, a 
man, 
An action of kindness in memory e'er dwells, 
So say a 
kind word when you can. 
So say a 
kind word, &c.

I 
will Meet thee, Darling. 
SONG AND DANCE. 
Words and music written for J. ARTHUR D OTY by J. M . 
TURNER. 
I 
will meet thee, darling loved one, I 
will meet thee 
• This evening as the hour approaches niro, 
When the little birds have ceased their merry warblings, 
And the pealing bells so sweetly sweetly chime. 
When the twinkling little stars are brightly shining, 
And the golden moon above doth softly beam, 
With a 
kiss of love I'll -reet your welcome coming 
In the gloaming by the little old mill stream. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, yes! my darling, I 
will meet you there, (Sym.) 
Where flowers sweet perfume the evening air; (Sym.) 
Where the rippling of the streamlet can but listen 
To words of love, just like a 
happy dream. 
You are alone my dearest, sweetest joy, 
I 
will meet thee by the little old mill stream. 
Then meet me with your loving arms to clasp me, 
I 
long and wait to see your pleasant smile; 
The streamlet unto thee sings songs of welcome, 
And happy moments we'll with love beguile. 
The hours which separate arc slowly passing, 
My heart is given wilally unto thee • 
I 
pray that love will hasten thee, beloved one, 
And bear thee swiftly, darling, unto me. 
Oh, yes, my darting, &c, 
My Thomas Cat. 
PARODY ON " WHOA, EMMA r 
BANJO SOLO—Written by J. M . 
TURNER for HARRY E. Low. 
I 
owned a 
Thomas cat, both lazy, big and fat. 
Old Biter was the darling pussy's name; 
He was chock full of gall, he could walk through a 
stone 
wall, 
Although his left ear was a 
trifle lame. 
SPOKEN—Yes, ladies and gentlemen, every evening as he 
sat in the first upper entrance on the 0. P. side of the fence, 
he would pitch his barrow-toned voice to " A 
scratch," and 
vocalize thus: 
CHORUS. 
Whoa, Maria! whoa, Maria! 
Come in the parlor and sit by the fire. 
Whoa, Maria! whoa, Maria! 
My love for you has made me perspire. 
The other night, quite late, while swinging on the gate, 
And singing to his love across the way, 
A Dutchman filled his gun with buckshot number one, 
But when he pulled the trigger Tommy said: 
Whoa, Maria, &c. 
His age was just one year the shot took off his ear, 
No more he sang " Oh, Ear-in is my home." 
His throat is rather sore, no more he'll wag his jaw, 
Upon the fences he has ceased to roam. 
Who, Maria, &c. 
We'll hear his voice no more on this unhappy shore, 
For yesterday, while suffering with the croup, 
He went for an alto note which bursted in his throat, 
And now he's planted under our back stoop. 
SPOKEN—So no more the refrain will be wafted on the 
midnight air of— 
Whoa, Maria, &e.

Since de Good Ole Folks Hab Gone. 
Words and music written by Jouti M. TURNER ibr DIXON and LOYD. 
Ole massa was a 
good old soul, 
And so was missy, too; 
Dey nebber used to whip us figs, 
As odder massars do. 
But de angels toted dem away, 
An' left us nigs to mourn, 
An' de ole homestead am broken down 
Since de good old folks hab gone. 
HE— 
SHE— 
CHORUS. 
De good ole times am past an' gone, 
We darkies wait for Gabriel's horn. 
Oh, de banjo string am broken, 
De fiddle am unstrung, 
No more we'll sing dem good old songs 
Like we did when we war young. 
But though you find us ole an' gray, 
An on de downward step, 
My Hannah here am just as dear, 
An' dere's life in de ole man yet. 
We hoe de corn an' sugar cane 
On de spot whar we was born, 
But de ole plantation ain't de same 
Since de good ole folks am gone.

Charles Augustus. 
BANJO SOLO. 
Written, composed and sung by FRANK B. 
CONVERSE. 
Oh! my name is Charles Augustus, and I 
trabbel on my figger, 
I 
love to play the banjo, for it makes me feel so gay; 
It fascinates the yaller gals, and drives away dull trubble, 
The white folks, too, they shake a 
shoe when I 
sit down 
to play. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, no! I 
guess not, it always kills 'em dead. (Sym.) 
It's no use a 
talkin', they just lay down and die; 
They nebber can stand de music of de string. 
It's a 
little ahead of anything that ebber was invented, 
Dey dance demselves to death when dey hear de banjo ring. 
De odder night I 
took Miss Rose down to a 
colored party, 
Dar sat Pete Blue, just ninety-two, an' ole Susannah Brown. 
Dey said dey couldn't dance bekase dey hab de influenzy, 
But dey made de people hustle when I 
took de banjo down. 
Oh, no! I 
guess not, &c. 
Young Caleb Broome, a 
dandy coon, insulted my Miss Rosa, 
He said she couldn't dance, bekase her feet spread all 
outdoors, 
I 
cut him with a 
razor, and a 
policeman he did grab me, 
Den he took me to de court-house ' cause dey said I 
broke 
de laws. 
Oh, no! I 
guess not, &c. 
De judge said he would sentence me for life up in de poorhouse, 
But I 
had de banjo wid me, so I 
just commenced to play. 
I 
got 'em all a 
dancin', when I 
struck 'em up de Juba, 
An' while de judge an' jury danced dis darkey ran away. , 
Oh, no! I 
guess not, & c. 
Diogenes Thump, the Sluggerite. 
BANJO SOLO. 
Written by JOHN M. 
TURNER for BILLY CARTEL 
Of a 
very hard case I'm going to cite— 
Diogenes Thump, the sluggerite--
You can bet he could chew and he could bite, 
For he loved a 
rough and tumble fight, 
He wipped his wife till she fell down dead, 
Then he licked his kids for crying for bread; 
He licked his landlord for charging him rent, 
Then he tore down the house and lived in a 
tent. 
He fought one round with old Joe Goss, 
And knocked him apart, as a 
matter of couse; 
He had a 
mouth like a 
sick giraffe, 
He'd break you in two and bite you in half. - 
He could take you in his mouth like a 
hinge, 
Then squirt you out like a 
big syringe; 
Oh, he was the man you had better avoid, 
He could eat yellow fever and vareloid. 
From a 
lamp-post he would bite a 
chunk, 
Then swallow the gas to mike him drunl, 
And though he weighed but forty pounds, 
He licked John Dwyer in seventeen rounds. 
He whipped his grandmother, aged ninety-four, 
And bit out the eye of his mother-in-law— 
For he was a 
terrible man. 
11 
Continued. 
Though he was clerk in a 
Sunday school, 
You can bet your life he was no fool, 
He'd read his little bible through, 
And used to go to vespers, too. 
He swallowed a 
pair of Arnheim's pants, 
Then gobbled his sisters, his cousins and his aunts; 
With Jimmy Elliot he swept the floor, 
And chewed up a 
crew of a 
Pinafore. 
He bit off the head of Dick Dead- eye, 
And washed it down with a 
gallon of rye. 
He swam with Boynton to Manhattan Beach, 
And licked all the Jews that came in his reach ; 
He cleaned out the bar of Corbin's hotel, 
And he knocked the guests too far to tell; 
He went to the beach to take a 
swim, 
But he drank up the ocean and sang a 
hymn. 
With a 
chew of tobacco he put out the moon, 
And Levy's cornet he kicked all out of tune ; 
Pushed a 
train of cars from the elevated track 
And then for a 
joke he put them all back. 
He started on foot to reach Brazil, 
And that is the last I 
have seen of the gill— 
For he was a 
terrible. man.

When silver locks replace the gold, 
I'll love you, darling, as of old, 
And kiss the cheek where bloom'd the rose, 
Ere life had crept so near its close. 
The eyes that were so fair and bright, 
Still shed for me their loving light, 
And on your lips I 
plainly see 
The smile that's always' dear to me. 
CHORUS. 
When silver locks replace the,gold, 
I'll love you, darling, as of4c1d, 
And kiss the cheek where bloom'd the l'CS.; 
Ere life had crept so near its elosa. 
When silver locks replace the gold, 
And love with some is growing old, 
I'll cling to you with all my heart, 
And death alone our love shall part; 
Thy face no more with ruby glows, 
The lily has replaced the rose, 
But still you are to me as dear, 
Your voice is just as sweet and clear. 
When silver locks, SI:e. 
When silver locks replace the gold,

And ' till life's busy dream is o'er 
I'll love you, darling, all the more.

When the roses bud and blossom 
By the rippling river side, 
Where they gently nod and listen 
To the music of the tide ; 
'While the early stars are shining, 
In the far-off azure deep, 
Come to meet me, clearest darling, 
When the birds have gone to sleep. 
CHORUS. 
Come to meet me, dearest darling, 
Where the shadows softly creep. 
In the calm and peaceful twilight, 
When the birds have gone to sleer 
How I 
long to hear you whisper 
All the story of our love, 
With nobody very near us 
Save the leaflets up above. 
Sweetest words to thee addressing, 
Loving arms around me creep, 
Could we evermore thus linger 
When the birds have gone to sleep. 
Come to meet me, &c.

WHEN ERIN FIRST ROSE. 
By the FIELDINGS. 
WHEN Erin first rose from the dark swelling flood, 
God blessed the green island, and saw it was good: 
The Emerald of Europe, it sparkled and shone, 
In the ring of the world, the most precious stone. 
In her sun, in her soil, in her station thrice blest, 
With her back toward Britain, and her 'ace to the West; 
Erin stands prouElly insular, on her steep shore, 
And strikes her high harp, ' mid the ocean's deep roar. 
By the groans that ascend from your forefather's grave, 
For their country thus left to the brute and the slave; 
Drive the demon of bigotry home to his den, 
And where tyrants made brutes, now let Erin make men. 
Let her sons, like the leaves of the shamrock unite, 
A 
partition of sects, from one foot-stalk of right, 
Give each his full share of the earth and the sky, 
Nor fatten the slave where the serpent would die. 
Alas! for poor Erin, that some are still seen, 
Who would dye the grass red, from their hatred to green; 
Yet, oh when we're up, and they're down let them live, 
Then yield them that mercy which they would not give. 
Arm of Erin be strong, but be gentle as brave, 
And uplifted to strike, be still ready to save 
Let no feeling of vengeance presume to defile, 
The cause of, or man of, the Emerald Isle. 
The cause it is good, and the men they are true, 
And the green shall unite with the Red, White, and Blue. 
And the triumphs of Erin her daughter shall share, 
With the full swelling chest, and the fair flowing hair. 
Their bosoms heave high for the worthy and brave, 
But no cowards shall rest in that full swelling wave; 
Men of Erin awake, and make haste to be blest, 
Rise arch of the Ocean, and quo 
of the West.

When My Ship Comes In. 
As sung by the FRENCH TWIN SISTERS. 
When the little birds begin to sing, 
And the silv'ry notes from their yellow throats 
Make the valleys and the woodlands ring 
With their music soft and low, 
I 
love to wander down beside the stream, 
In the twilight ray so dim, 
And I 
watch each night by the moon's pale light, 
For I'm waiting till my ship comes in. 
Ship ahoy 
CHORUS. 
When the little birds begin to sing, 
And the silv'ry notes from their yellow throats 
Make the valley and the woodlands ring, 
Then I'm waiting till my ship comes in. 
[Repeat last line. 
Oh, my love has gone across the sea, 
For he sailed away on a 
summer's day, 
And he took my loving heart from me, 
With his uniform so grand. 
He sailed away with heart so light and gay, 
In a 
ship so neat and trim, 
And no joy I'll see till he comes back to me, 
So I'm waiting till my ship comes in. 
When the little birds, &c. 
Oh, they say he'll be a 
captain bold, 
And will have command of a 
ship so grand, 
But I'm waiting, too, for something more, 
When my love comes back to me. 
For then I 
shall be dearer far to him 
Than the rank he strove to win; 
And my heart beats light, as I 
watch to-night, 
For I'm waiting till my ship comes in. 
When the little birds, & c. 
DARLING LITTLE GERTIE. 
Sung by DELEIIANTY & DENGLER's MINSTRELS. 
DARLING 
little Gertie, 
Winsome, bright, and fair, 
Sweeter than the blossoms, 
In the sunny air; 
Music of the brooklet, 
Melody of birds, 
Live within her laughter, 
And her loving words. 
CHORUS. 
Ah ! darling little Gertie, 
Fairy of our home, 
Joy and sunlight follow, 
Where thy steps ma :oam; 
Where thy step ..-ay roam. 
Fairy of our home, 
Joy and sunlight follow, darling, 
Fairy of our home. 
Darling little Gertie, 
Sunshine of our days,

All her loving ways 
Dearer than the dew-drops, 
To the fadinv flower,

Blooming in our bower. 
Ah! darling, Jpe 
Darling little Gertie, 
Ever fair and bright! 
Sunny be thy pathway, 
Idol of delight! 
May the kindly angels 
Guide thy little feet, 
When life's storm of sorrow,

Ah I

Fly across the ocean, birdie, 
Fly beyond that gloomy sea; 
There you'll find a 
truant lover, 
Who has pledged his life to me. 
Tell him how my heart was aching, 
Aching that I 
gave him pain ; 
That my pride will not allow him 
To recall those words again. 
ClIOLLIS. 
Birdie, Birdie, Darling birdie, 
Do not tarry on the way; 
When you hear the ocean murmur, 
Birdie, birdie fly away. 
Take with you this glossy ringlet, 
Place it on his bosom bare; 
Tell him, birdie, to remember, 
How my curls have nestled there. 
Let him call to mind the moments, 
When our hearts were both so free, 
When he pledged his life forever, 
Unto me, yes, unto me. 
Birdie, birdie, Ice. 
Let him think how once he falter'd, 
Near the window, by my side, 
When he ask'd me would I 
love him? 
When he ask'd me for his bride ? 
Fly away, now birdie, darling, 
Stay no more to hear me seigh ; 
There now, bless you, birdie, bless you, 
Bear my message through the sky, 
Birdie, birdie, Jr.o.

Presented to FIELDS and H ANSON. 
Give my boxing-gloves to brother, mammie, when I'm dead, 
When the sexton puts me under in my little bed ; 
If the job is like to throw him when the string he jerks, 
Get some little boy to show him how the old thing works. 
[Repeat last line, 
Mamma, buy me a 
bran new Ulster, hire a 
Pullman car, 
Give me a 
bath of Florida water, I 
see the gates ajar ; 
Give me a 
dose of paregoric—there's nothing about me mean, 
Give the sexton half a 
dollar to see that my grave's kept green. 
[Repeat last line. 
Give my chewing gum to sister, I 
don't want it any more, 
On my lips it raised a 
blister that was awful sore ; 
Sing to me the Last Rose of Summer—mamma, don't you cry, 
For in the clouds I'll raise a 
racket, in the sweet by and by. 
[Repeat last line. 
Sprinkle my body with powdered sugar, smear me over with 
tar, 
Cover my form with peacock's feathers—I 
want to be an 
angel, ma; 
Let me bite the old torn cat's tail off, she can't ketch no mice, 
Let me go bathing with the girls—it's naughty, but it's nice. 
[Repeat last line. 
Banjo Solo. 
Written by J. L. FREENY, expressly for JAMES D. 
ROOME, Banjoist. 
The gal that I 
will sing about, 
Is very fond of me 
Around the waist she's very stout, 
And stands about ten foot three. 
Her foot is a 
tremendous size— 
She wears number twenty-two; 
Her ears are like an elephant's, 
And she walks like a 
kangaroo. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, big-foot Sal, she's the gal, 
That's known by every one; 
She can waltz on her ear, and drink lager beer, 
And she weighs about five ton. 
She can sing, and play the old banjo, 
At that she can't be beat; 
And dance the light fantastic toe, 
With her tremendous feet. 
Her mouth resembles a 
railroad tunnel; 
She presents a 
terrible sight; 
Her hand would cover an acre of ground; 
Like a 
bull- dog she can fight. 
Oh, big-foot Sal, etc. 
She went to a 
ball the other night, 
And what do you think she done ? 
To raise a 
muss, she put out the light, 
Then took to her heels and run. 
The gals did scream, the men did shout, 
To catch that crazy gal; 
But there wasn't a 
man with bluck enough, 
To mule 
Oh, big-foot Sal, etc.

To please you all once more. 
Then pray lend your attention 
And listen to this "stew," 
A 
new conglomeration

The girl I

Was the dark girl drsssed in blue, 
She had a

Hip, up dee doo den doo. 
She had the ring her mother wore, 
Her name is Maggie May, 
We parted by the river side— 
She, I 
and old dog Tray. 
Dear mother I 
remember well, 
The days when I 
was young, 
rye often heeded your advice, 
Of Billy, hold your tongue. 
But now, I'm old and growing weak, 
And dead is Cora Lee, 
Oh give me back those happy dam 
In the cottage by the sea.

Cats in Our Back Yard. 
Copyrighted by A. 3. FISHER, 1879. 
I 
live in a 
brown stone tenement, 
With green shutters painted white; 
There's a 
family of cats lives in the rear, 
They play " Pinafore" every night. 
They sing something about Maria, 
And the times are very hard; 
Oh, they'll chew tobacco and spit in your eye 
The cats in our back yard. 
CHORUS. 
Tral a 
le, tral a 
la, 
For the cats in our back yard. 
(Repeat.) 
They have walking matches on the fence, 
Have picnics in the cellar; 
I 
threw seventy bricks at a 
Thomas, 
You ought to hear them beller. 
They sing alto, base, and tenor, 
Oh, they ought to be feathered and tarred! 
Oh, they are worse than Haverley's Minstrels, 
Yes, the cats in our back yard. 
Tral a 
le, tral a

BEHIND THE SCENES. 
As sung by WILL. Monrow. 
When but a 
tittle boy, oh, it really was my 
joy 
To visit the theatre, I'll admit, 
And how happy I 
would be, the performances to sere 
While seated in the gallery or pit. 
I 
fancied all was real, that the curtain did reveal, 
But since that I 
have passed beyond my teens; 
I 
begin to understand, though in front it may look grana% 
It's very different just behind the scenes. 
So if if you will attend for a 
moment, now my friends, 
I'll do the best within my humble means, 
To show to you to- night, though in front it may look bright. 
It's very different just behind the scenes. 
The comedian is one, who, while causing lots of fun, 
His heart may yet hang heavy in his breast; 
And he who plays the king, though it seems a 
curious thing, 
In private may be very poorly dressed. 
Then the ballet girl so fair, who goes floating through the air, 
And looks like little angels there instead ; 
Sometimes they have to roam, into a 
wretched home, 
And oftentimes go supperless to bed. 
And those who play the parts, of the men with stony hearts, 
And look as if their tempers were like fiends; 
Gould you see them while away, you certainly would say 
They're the mildest looking men behind the scenes. 
Now there's many a 
married pair, I've no doubt you are aware, 
Who in public are so tender and so kind; 
But could you only see them at home in privacy, 
A 
very difierent state of things you'd find. 
Sometimes it is the wife who causes all the strife, 
Sometimes it is the husband who's to blame; 
27 
But be that as it may, who causf 3 
all the fray, 
Their quarreling cont!nuesjuet the same. 
And oft they try to hide from all the world outside, 
The snarls and jars with which their household toemf. . 
And often when you hear them call each other dear, 
They hate each other just behind the scenes. 
Now its just the samo in life, though what lots of care and 
strife. 
And suffering some folks will undergo 
Just to cut a 
shine, and to make the tselves look fine, 
They think of nothing else but outside show. 
Some fancy and suppose, that those who wear good clothes, 
Always are they richest and the best; 
But an honest heart and mind, is respected most you"1 find, 
No matter whether rich or poorly dressed. 
Then r.o matter where we go, from the highest to the low, 
From peasantry ' way up to kings or queens. 
Whateser we enjoy, there's something to annoy, 
If we qould only peep behind the scenes. 
Written by E. HARRIGAN. 
As sung by the famous 
HARRIGAN & HART. 
I 
lived in Brooklyn, on the Heights— 
I 
often cross the ferry 
To Catharine street, where I 
usually meet 
Me second cousin Jerry. 
It was last night I 
got so tight— 
The divil a 
penny to- day. 
At Maloney's bar were beer and cigars--
I'm all broke up to-day. 
CHORUS. 
An me head feels like a 
cabbage, 
I'm laboring under a 
still; 
You'll hafter get a 
hoisting horse 
To draw me up a 
hill. 
I'm not intoxicated, 
But slightly elevated; 
With joy I'm overheated— 
I'm all broke up to-day. 
Prom Maloney's we went to Casey's— 
It was after twelve o'clock! 
We eat hot clams and fry's of lambs— 
Three barrels of saddle rocks ! 
Men from Tyrol and sweet Athlone, 
Across the Atlantic Sea, 
Had arguments—of consequence 
I'm all broke up to day. 
I 
am Coming, Darling, Coming.

I 
am coming, darling, coming, 
Down the dear old shady lane ; 
Tho' the birds and bees are humming, 
Yet my heart is filled with pain: 
For I 
know that I 
will miss you, 
Something softly tells me so ; 
So I'm coming, just to kiss you 
Once again before you go. 
CHORUS. 
I 
am coming, for I'll miss you, 
When you wander to and fro; 
I 
am coming, just to kiss you, 
Once again before you go. 
ham coming, for to-morrow, 
You'll be wandering afar, 
And the thought brings pain and sorrow, 
Since I've learned how dear you are; 
Smiles of thine no more may cheer me, 
But in mem'ry sweet and low, 
Tho'ts of thee will linger near me, 
As you wander to and fro. 
I 
am coming, 16c. 
I 
am coming where you wander, 
'Neath the shadows down the lane; 
And I 
dreamed of days o'er yonder, 
When in joy we meet again; 
Future years will keep no sadness, 
In their store for you and me; 
All the days shall smile with gladness, 
When our hearts united be. 
I 
am coming, tke.

Written and composed by HARRY MONTAGUE, and sung by 
ini with overwhelming applause at Tony Pastor's Theatre, New 
York. 
I 
met a 
fair charmer a 
few weeks ago 
In a 
Madison Avenue stage, 
Her style and her figure it pleased me you know 
She was just about the right age. 
As we were alone, I 
suggested to her 
In terms quite polite and refined, 
I'd be most happy to see her safe home, 
She said yes, if you'll be so kind. 
SPOKEN.—S0 
I 
took the young lady to her home, she invited 
ne in, and I 
spent a very pleasant evening, and just before t 
eft 
CHORUS. 
I 
tickled her under the chin 
tickl,;d again and again 
Sh. did no say no, she liked it you know 
When I 
tickled her under the chin. 
I 
called by appointment to see her next day, 
And asked her il she'd take a 
drive, 
She said I'm delighted, that's just what 
waatt 
And in a 
moment was close by my side. 
Now driving you know, max" your appetite keen 
So when we got baciK, to Delmonico's we wont, 
And I 
ordered some oysters 9.nd wine. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, we had a delightful supper together, a,-.11 
Iter supper when the wine commenced to make her CLIONES 
.
4Z,V! I 
reached across the table, and I 
_Pickled hoe under .iga 
46,t, 
31 
Now I 
see her quite often, and you wont be surpris.,d 
That our friendship ripened so fast, 
For I 
found that in her, I 
really had met, 
A 
dear, darling creature at last, 
And our love grows stronger, day after day, 
We're going to be married next June, 
And it all came about, through that queer little wt 
That I 
tickled her under the chin. 
SPOKEN.—S0 
last night when she bid me good bye, as 
front door, she said Charley, you dear good fellow, I'll never 
get the first time that you— 
Tickled me under the chin, 
That you tickled me under the chin, 
I 
didn't say no, for I 
liked it you know, 
When you tickled me under the chin, 
When I 
tickle her under the chin, 
I 
tickled again and again, 
She did not say no, for she liked it you know. 
When I 
tickled her under the chin. 
6rosEN.—This is the moral of the story: 
You all have a 
chance for adventures like this. 
With the charming young ladies you meet, 
And you'll find on an average that five out of ten 
Won't object to a 
drive and a 
treat; 
But pray let me give you one piece of advice, 
When a 
girl's loving kiss you would win, 
Just do it quite gently and don't be too rough, 
When you tickle her under the chin. 
CHORES. 
When you tickle her under the chin, 
Repeat—When you tickle her under the chin, 
Just do it quite gently and don't be too rough, 
When you tickle her under the chin. 
Written and sung by HAnal 13mm= 
You see before you a 
jolly old man, 
My age is sevetty-two; 
I 
ne'er let sorrow remain in my heart, 
And I 
never am sad or blue; 
I've wrestled with fortune many a 
year— 
Of trouble I've Lad a 
good share ; 
But I 
smokes my pipe, and drinks my be.,.-
For misfortune I 
do not care. 
CiloBus. 
Fol de lol, lol de lol, dum d,d dum day; 
I 
sing and dance all ray sorrows away; 
I 
like to be merry, jolly and gay— 
:Poi de lol, lol de lol, dum de dum day. 
kinie people meet all their troubles half way, 
And always are borrowing woe; 
And that is the reason their hair turns gray, 
And their spirits do get so low. 
Now take my advice, give care a 
wide berth, 
Let your hearts be happy and light; 
For nothing is gained by crying, you know, 
So keep your eyes sparkling and bright. 
CHORUS. 
Fol de lol, lol de lol, dum de dum day, 
I 
sing and dance all my sorrows away; 
I 
like to be merry, jolly and gay— 
Fol de loial

LITTLE BROWN JUG. 
My wife and I 
live all alone 
In a 
neat little cot we call our own; 
She loves gin and I 
love rum, 
I 
tell you what we have lots of fun. 
CHOB US. 
Ha, ha, ha! you and me, 
Little brown jug don't I 
love thee. 
*via ;mu that makes me wear old clothes. 
'Tis you that makes my friends my foes. 
were she is beneath my nose, 
Tip her up and down she goes. 
Ha, ha, ha! Ace, 
When I 
go toiling to my farm, 
I 
take little brown jug under my arm. 
I 
put her under a 
shady tree, 
Little brown jug don't I 
love thee. 
Ha, ha, ha! A7e. 
If I'd a 
cow which gave such milk, 
I'd clothe her in the finest silk; 
I'd feed her on the sweetest hay, 
And I'd milk her forty times a 
day. 
Ha, ha, ha! 
The rose is red, my nose is too, 
The violet's blue, and so are you ; 
And yet I 
guess before I 
stop, 
I'd better take another drop. 
Ha, ha, hat ecc.

While she in return used to nudge his old ribs, 
Though sixty, 'twits plain he with Cupid was struck, 
He kissed her, and squeezed her, and called her his duck, 
But though his love was so hot he never forgot, 
To turn off the gas at the meter.

One morning they walked off to church all-

They haven't a

But tells his young wife that there's time enough yet. 
They've a 
cot out of town where for light they've no lamp, 
But he's best pleased when living in town, the old scamp, 
For he says it's a

To turn off the gas at the meter.

EIT HIM AGAIN, HE'S GOT NO FRIENDS, 
Sung with great success by TONY PASTOR. 
The ups and downs of this great world, 
Would fill a 
mighty book, 
But those in luxury pass by, 
And seldom chance to look 
On those whom fortune has not blest, 
With friendship's pitying eye, 
But hear his story with a•shrug, 
And coldly pass him by (with)— 
CHORUS. 
Hit him again, he's got no friends, 
Drive him away from the door; 
Hit him, again, he's got.no friends, 
What good is a 
man when he's poor? 
A man of wealth may be a 
lion 
In party, club or ball, 
Courted by men of high degree, 
By ladies great and small; 
But speculations fickle hand, 
May sweep away his gold, 
What then do men of high degree, 
What will the ladies say ? (why)— 
Hit him again, etc. 
But then the road is very long, 
That turns not in its way, 
For tides will rise, the cat will mew, 
The dog will have his day; 
The rich man now may then be poor, 
The poor man have his place, 
And he who snubs to- day may look 
Into the other's face (and say)— 
Hit him again, etc.

SOMETHING IN THE CITY. 
Sung with great success by W ILL H. 
MORTON, with Harrigan 
and Hart's Combination. 
I 
live up town in Harlem, 
Every morning out I 
crawl, 
Perhaps I 
come to town, 
Perhaps don't come at all. 
My movements are uncertain, 
And curious folks I 
pity, 
For they would like to know quite well, 
What I 
do in the city. 
Spoken—My neighbors can't find out what I 
do for a 
living; 
they have all come to the conclusion, however, that I 
do.— 
CHORUS. 
Something in the city, 
Something in the city, 
They don't know quite, they think they're right, 
Something in the city. 
(Repeat.) 
Some say that I'm a 
banker, 
Or deal in foreign wares, 
Some say that I'm a 
broker, 
Among the Bulls and Bears. 
Some say that I'm a 
lawyer, 
But all the maidens pretty, 
Think that I'm a 
preacher, or do 
Something in the city. 
Something, etc. 
Perhaps I 
meet with Smith, 
We talk about the weather, 
Up comes Brown (you all know Brown), 
We have a 
drink together. 
When I 
am gone, Brown says " who's he?" 
" 
That's Johnson, very witty," 
"What does h do?" " Bless me if I 
know, 
$poken—Oh, yes l 
he does— 
Something in the city. 
Spoken—It's been remarked in my Deghborhood that I 
was 
in the lottery business, and the young ladies they all say I'm 
on the press. 
But they are all wrong. 
Now I 
tell you confi-
dentially what I 
do for a 
living. 
Every time I 
go down town, 
I 
do—well--
Something, et4 
Written by FRANK VAN HESS for ED. BURTON, and sung by him 
with great success. 
Oh! I 
love the bright days of my youth to review, 
And fancy again I'm a 
boy, 
With my merry companions so faithful and true, 
And friendship that knows no alloy. 
Oh ! the thoughts I 
review as I 
ponder the past, 
Recalling each dear youthful scene; 
The one I 
most prize, and will love to the last, 
Is the old village school on the green. 
(Repeat two last lines.) 
Near the old village school the cottage still stands, 
Where I 
first saw the dawn of light; 
And now over its porch in rich clustering bands, 
The roses are blooming as bright 
As ' twas when with garlands and wreaths of wild flowers, 
We joyously crowned our May Queen, 
And told childish love tales in neat little bowers, 
Near the old village school on the green. 
(Repeat two last lines.) 
I 
have left many dear and some loved ones behind 
To rest as I've journeyed along; 
There are others remain just as faithful and kind, 
To join in the laugh and the song; 
And when I 
am called by grim death to prepare, 
t 
will answer with spirit serene, 
they'll lay me to rest when I 
breathe my last prayer, 
sear the old village school on the green.

THE OLD LOG CABIN ON THE HILL. 
Witten by FRANK DUMONT, and sung by HARRY W OODSON 
with great success at Tony Pastor's. 
Far away in the South, among the cotton fields, 
is the place I 
ever long to see, 
Oh I 
the dear sunny clime where I 
was bred and born, 
And the memory is ever dear to me; 
Oh the mocking bird's singing in the trees close by, 
While far from the spot I 
now roam, 
In this wide, weary world wherever I 
may go, 
There is no place like the dear old home. 
CHORUS. 
Then give me a 
home in the dear old South, 
For fondly I 
love it still; 
Then I 
sigh night and day, I 
long to see again 
Is that old log cabin on the hill. 
Oh 
the ones I 
love is sleeping in the ground, 
When I 
am passing so fast away, 
And my heart grows so sad I 
long to return, 
Oh the old man ain't what he used to be; 
And the magnolias bloom around the cabin door, 
'Tis then I 
turn with a 
sigh, 
Oh i 
I 
will go back again, back to them cotton fields, 
In that old cabin home there let me die. 
Then give me, eve.

Her mother was his early love, 
Her sire his boyhood's friend, 
And when they pass'd away, their child, 
The old man vow'd to tend. 
She was the sunshine of his home, 
A 
rose so bright and fair, 
With all her mother's loving ways, 
Her eyes and golden hair, 
Her eyes and golden hair. 
What wonder to his lonely heart 
Crept back the love;of 
But autumn may not wed with spring, 
He cherished it untold; 
But autumn may not wed with spring, 
He cherished it untold. 
One day there came a 
seemly knight, 
To woo her from his side, 
The old man smiled upon him, 
For her sake, his joy and pride, 
His joy and pride. 
But fickle was the knight and false, 
(A story threadbare old.) 
He woo'd her for a 
little while, 
Then wed for lands and gold. 
A 
blighted flower can bloom no more, 
The old man wept one day, 
As murmuring the name she lov'd,

The Neighbors on Our Block. 
Written by W ASH. FAVOR for the " Irish Emperors," FAVOR and Sittwo9 
Now I'll try for to tell ye me troubles, 
And what I'm going to relate 
It happens to me almost dajly, 
In this unfortunate unlucky State. 
I 
have a 
large family of children, 
And they never wore shoe nor a 
sod:, 
But they all kick up the very divel 
With the neighbors that's on the same block. 
There's Cornelius, the youngest of eleven, 
He's a 
twin to his big brother Gile 
That's left him and went off to heaven, 
To spend six years up on the Isle. 
And Patsy, the Bum, as they call him, 
Was hauled in for picking a 
lock, 
And Mickey got licked like the divel 
By the neighbors that live on the block. 
Now there's Polly, my only daughter, 
Who's just turned twelve years of age, 
She's skipping and dancing the tra la lu, 
The same as they do on the stage. 
But the rest of the boys have me crazy, 
For on every one's door they do knock ; 
And I'm sure they'll be sent to the Island 
By the neighbors that's on the same block

One summer's night ten years ago, 
The gang and brother Jim, 
Brought me down to the dock you know, 
To learn me how to swim. 
They tied a 
rope around my waist, 
And then they heaved me in, 
To tell the truth, I 
was nearly drowned, 
The night I 
learned to swim. 
CHORUS. 
Swim out says Pete, arrah kick your feet, 
Go over-hand says brother Jim, 
The gang did shout as they dragged me out, 
The night I 
learned to swim. 
Oh! " chew roast-beef, the beef is tough," 
The gang sung out to me; 
They daubed my face with lumps of tar, 
I 
looked like a 
Chinee. 
I 
made back- dives and somersaults, 
Along with Shorty Tim; 
Both my feet were cut with copper nails, 
The night I 
learned to swim. 
(Ghoru8.) 
I 
was chock full of salt water, 
Brought to a 
liquor store, 
There they rolled me on a 
barrel, 
For two long hours or more. 
Sure they made me drink some brandy, 
I 
had the jim-jam-jams, 
I'll ne'er forget, as long as I 
live, 
The night I 
learned to swim.

Though Rich I'm No Better than You. 
MOTTO SONG. 
Sung with great success by HARRY MONTAGUE. 
What care I 
to-day for the world and its way, 
I 
can smile when the poor they do frown ; 
Though rich I 
have grown, there's no one can say, 
The poor man I 
ever put down. 
I 
help him along when I 
find him in need, 
What more would you ask me to do— 
But it's this that I 
want to impress on your minds-
Though rich I'm no better than you. 
CHORUS. 
Though you see me to-day in this costly array, 
Who knows what I 
yet may go through ? 
So you'll find just as far as equality goes, 
Though rich I'm no better than you. 
Last night in the street a 
poor man I 
did meet, 
Who asked me if aid I 
would give, 
I 
extended my hand at the poor man's demand. 
Yes, says I, my dear friend, you must live. 
I 
gave him assistance, he thanked me and said, 
It is hard sir, but what can I 
do ? 
Says I, my dear friend, be that as it may, 
Though rich I'm no better than you. 
Though you see me, &c. 
In conclusion I'd state though your lot may be great, 
Don't think yourself better than all, 
But bear this in mind, for its truth you will find, 
The greatest of men sometimes fall. 
Tho' the poor man may want and the rich man may haze, 
There's one thing I 
k
4how to be true, 
Let death come a- knocking at either man's door, 
Though rich I'm no better than you. 
Though you see rne, &c.

Topics of the Day. 
As sung by Miss LULU WENTwoRTH with great success. 
'Tis of a 
subject new I'm going to sing to you, 
Please give me your attention now I 
pray; 
It's about the Silver Bill and whose pockets it will fill, 
just listen now to what I'm going to say. 
Bard money at last has got the bill to pass, 
But to good old honest greenbacks we should cling. 
President Hayes made a 
veto, but he found it was a 
go, 
That shows that he's not solid with the ring. 
CHORUS. 
What does Congress mean to do to let such bills pass through? 
When they know our nation's debt we've got to pay. 
I 
thought it was but right to mention here to- night 
Some of the leading topics of the day. 
There's the Chinese question too,at Congress has pass'd through, 
There's enough of heathens in the Golden State; 
Now fifty pounds, I 
am told, they have to pay in gold, 
Before they'll be allowed to emigrate ; 
No more they'll wash the dirt from our collars, cuffs and shirts, 
We want no Chinese laundries in our land ; 
But still there's one thing more should be banished from our 
That's Sitting Bull and his bloodthirsty band. [shore, 
What does Congress mean, &c. 
There's little Jimmy Blaine, from away down East in Maine, 
He knows he's dealing with a 
lot of loons, 
And Ben Butler he is great, both his eyes are getting straight, 
He's looking out for some more silver spoons. 
Bob Ingersoll as well is telling us of hell, 
And Beecher giving lectures on the same ; 
I'm sure they'll meet there, for of sin they've done their share, 
And the devil on them both has got a 
claim. 
CHORUS. 
• 
What does Plymouth mean to do if what Elizabeth says is true; 
They've expelled her from the church, the papers said. 
I 
thought it was but right to mention here to-night 
:one of the leading topics of the day.

Sung with success by J. D. Roomc all over the country. 
Good folks listen, and listen to me right, 
I'm chock full of trouble from morning until night, 
Fell down stairs with my head full of bother, 
If I'd fell another step, I'd fell a 
step farther, 
Sisters won't you come and join our band, 
Brothers won't you come there too, 
Come and join us without a 
boot or shoe, 
For nobody knows, no not even to you. 
CHORUS. 
Nobody knows what trouble I 
see, 
Nobody knows in the world but me. 
Nobody knows what trouble I 
see, 
Nobody knows nobody but me. 
Skeeter and. a 
bed bug kept a 
hotel, 
Had twenty boarders doing mighty well, 
Business got bad, hotel went to smash, 
Skeeter and the bed bug smothered in the hash, 
Had a 
crate of chickens and they flew so mighty high, 
One of them flew in the skeeter's eye, 
Chickens got sick all laid up with the croup, 
Skeeter and the bed bug drowned in the soup. 
No body knows etc. 
Went to the ball at the other end of town, 
Down in the celler on the bare ground, 
Do a 
double shuffle just as I 
please, 
Dog was a 
dancing, so was the fleas, 
Went to the meeting and they axed me to kneel, 
In come Dinah with a 
square toed heel, 
Head in the house and heels in the street, 
And the preacher said, well Dinah, now I'm glad you brought 
your feet. 
No body know p

11ASV 
Sung by Pettit & White with tremendous alccuss. 
Gather around me brave and bold, 
If my song is new it can't be old, 
And if it's short it can't be long, 
And as it's right it can't be wrong, 
And as it's small it can't be tall, 
Of course there's more so that ain't all. 
Once there lived a 
colored man, 
And when he walked he never ran, 
When he was born his life began, 
And Mary's lamb it was a 
ram, 
He never drinks so he don't get drunk, 
And he has no clothes so he don't need a 
valise. 
Now when I'm happy I 
never frek, 
If your eyes are dry they can't be wet, 
For when you laugh you doesn't cry, 
If that's the truth it ain't a 
lie, 
When I 
am wrong I'm never right, 
I'll sing you some more to-morrow evening.

HARD TO LOVE. 
As sung by CHARLES BACKUS, of the San Francisco Minstres. 
I 
LOVED a 
girl not long ago. 
Her father drove a 
cart, 
But she's gone and left me all alone, 
And broken my poor heart. 
CHORUS. 
Hard to love, hard to love, 
hard to change my mind. 
She's broken the heart of many another nig, 
And she's almost broken mine. 
I 
know I'll die, I'm sure I 
will, 
I 
feel it in my heart, 
Aid if she don't marry me 
I 
will steal her father's mule and cart 
Hard to love, dte 
Her front name was Susan Jane, 
She had a 
foot like a 
giraffe, 
And every time she went to walk, 
She made the darkies laugh. 
Hard to love. lee. 
It ever I 
do marry again, 
It won't be for love or riches, 
I'll marry a 
gal 'bout ten-foot-ten, 
So she can wear my overcoat.

Kiss Me, Mamma, Kiss Me. 
Composed by Wm. A. 
HUNTLEY, and sung by J. S. 
KELLY, of Corncross' 
Minstrels. 
" 
Kiss me mamma, kiss me, 
For I 
am going to sleep," 
Rachoed through the boat's saloon 
That night upon the deep. 
The little one who spoke the words 
Was merry, sweet and fair, 
And with a 
loving sister kind, 
They were an angel pair. 
CHORUS. 
" 
Kiss me, mamma, kiss me, 
For I 
am going to sleep," 
Reechoed through the boat's saloon 
That night upon the deep. 
" 
Kiss me, mamma, kiss me, 
For I 
am going to sleep," 
Are words that stirred the strongest hearts, 
That made the tender weep; 
And when the sinking " Metis " fought 
The surging billows high, 
How painful must have been the sight 
To see the darlings die ! 
" 
Kiss me, mamma," &c. 
" 
Kiss me, mamma, kiss me, 
For I 
am going to sleep," 
Was a 
presentiment most true 
That night upon the deep; 
Though none had thought the coming morn 
They'd perish in the waves, 
Or that the little ones so soon 
Would sleep in silent graves. 
" 
Kiss me, mamma," &C. 
Kicking Mule. 
Copyrighted, 1879, by A. J. FIERIER, 24 Vesey St., N. Y 
Originally sung by BILLY' CARTER. 
There was a 
little kicking man, 
us name was Simon Slick, 
He owned a 
mule with dreamy eyes, 
And how that mule could kick. 
He'd shut one eye and shake his tail, 
And greet you with a 
smile, 
Then gently telegraph his leg, 
And raise you half a 
mile. 
CHORUS. 
This mule was a 
kicker, 
He'd raise you up slicker, 
And knock you down quicker 
Than Baxter street liquor, 
He eat like a 'nicker, 
A 
hungry bill sticker, 
As a 
kicker, no quicker 
Could ever be found. 
His skin was gutta percha, 
And his hoof was hard as lead, 
He'd lift you like a 
feather too, 
And stand you on your head, 
He'd kick as quick as lightning, 
And he had an iron jaw, 
He was just the thing to have around 
To tame your mother-in-law. 
CHORUS. 
His hoof would amaze ye 
And make you feel hazy, 
How nice he could raise ye 
And knock you clean crazy. 
This mule was a 
daisy, 
Although he was lazy, 
This daisy so lazy 
could kick 1;k- a

KICKING MULE. 
(Continued.) 
Ffe"bit a 
Thomas cat in two, 
And pulverized a 
hog, 
He dissected seven Chinamen, 
And mash'd a 
yaller dog, 
He kicked the stuffing from a 
goose, 
And broke a 
nigger's back, 
And stopped an Erie railway train, 
And kicked it off the track. 
CHORUS. 
His shoes they were rusty, 
His temper was crusty, 
His eyes they were musty, 
His tail it was dusty, 
His shape would disgust ye, 
He'd kick till he'd bust ye, 
He was musty and dusty, 
And rusty also. 
He'd stop a 
steamboat with his head, 
And kick it out of sight, 
He'd kick a 
boarding house apart 
At twelve o'clock at night. 
The boarders in their short stop clothes (suits), 
They stood and held their breath, 
When he rammed his hind legs down his throat 
And kicked himself to death. 
This mule he was spunky, 
He'd climb like a 
monkey 
And bray like a 
donkey, 
You bet he was Mulkey 
Although he was chunkey, 
No fool or no flunkey 
Played him for a 
monkey, 
Or donkey, oh, no.

GET THEE GONE GIRL. 
Written by C. R. Dockstader, for and sung by J. D. Rome. 
As I 
was a 
reading the paper last night, 
I 
saw there a 
story that I 
will recite, 
It's about a 
young damsel got stuck on a 
clerk, 
She bothered him daily while he was at work 
Oh, this gal she would watch him and on him keep an eye, 
She swore she would have him or with him she' d 
die, 
When she went to embrace him he'd yelp loud and strong. 
Get thee gone girl, get thee gone girl, 
But the girl wouldn't get thee gone. 
Oh, she tortured him hourly and stuck just like glue, 
Ire wasted away and his clothes he fell through. 
He rented a 
barnyard and slept in the shed, 
And this girl she hung till his reason had fled, 
Now she crawled through a 
knot hole and roost by his side 
-With a 
hunk of blue ribbon his ankles she tied, 
When he awoke from his sl ,Ambers like a 
hero did say, 
Get thee away girl, get thee away girl, 
But the girl wouldn't get thee away. 
Oh, she followed him around and one evening he died, 
He opened his mug and he let his breath slide, 
In an alley way they have laid him to take his last sleep. 
Where the torn cats do fight and the bull dogs do eat. 
Oh, she dressed herself up in a 
new sunday coat, 
With some white wash his age on a 
shovel she wrote 
Now she gets boiling full and the boys all Jo shout. 
Get thee out girl, get thee out girl, 
But the girl don't get thee out.

Dot Little Alley Vay. 
Sung by LARRY TOOLEY. AIR " 
Dot Little German Band." 
Two weeks gone by I've peen so dry, 
I 
couldn't get my beer; 
De Excise law closed all saloons, 
De front door und de rear. 
A 
friend of mine said go mit me 
Down to his father-by-law. 
De blace we found, but a 
sign, dot read, 
Closed by the Excise law. 
CHORUS. 
Dot little alley vay, dot little alley vay, 
De door vas closed, I 
vas most froze 
In dot alley vay. 
Dot little alley ray, dot little alley ray, 
I 
vas so dry, I 
dought I'd die 
Down in dot alley vay. 
We talked und valked about three miles, 
Den I 
commenced to dink 
De beer saloons vas.like de timbs, 
We couldn't get a 
drink. 
At last I 
vent into a 
yard, 
An' a 
hydrant dere I 
saw; 
Und de neighbors said de poor ding 
Vas closed by the Excise law. 
SPOKEN—Dalk about never mind, mind de river till de 
veil runs dry. 
I 
run—dry—a 
reek. 
Ve got in a 
blace at 
last und ye got a 
drink; und ve closed—vas de bar minder's 
eye vat ye closed. 
Den he closed; he got a 
good deal, 
Closeder before he got drough, he hit my partner in de mout 
mit a 
ballet. 
He vent home, got dr: lock jaws und couldn't 
open his mout. 
Dey had de bar minder put in jail, but de 
judge let him go; he said de man's mout vos closed by de 
Excise law. He took me vere his radder-by-law keep a 
saloon,

Vell, I

SUBOECT.—" And as the policeman raised the beautiful 
child, cold and damp from the dews of night, one thought 
alone possessed our minds: What if our dear child had 
shared his fate ?—.1forning Paper. 
The labor is over and done, 
The Sun has gone down in the West, 
The birds are asleep, every one, 
All nature has gone to its rest; 
But one little sleeper is out in the cold, 
Alone, in the rain and sleet; 
There's no one to greet him with welcome kiss', 
Or list to his coming feet. 
CHORUS. 
Dead! dead! found dead in the street. 
Dead in the cold night air : 
Dead for the want of a 
crust; 
With no one to pity or care. 
The daisy looks up from the grass, 
Just fresh from the fingers of night, 
To welcome the birds as they pass, 
And drink in fresh rivers of light. 
But one little sleeper has gone to his rest— 
Has gone to his Heavenly birth ; 
And there, all alone, by the Church door stone, 
He passe & from the sorrows of earth. 
Dead ! dead ! 
DRIFTING DOWN THE CREEK. - 
Written for TONY PASTOR, by FRiNk DUMONT. 
ONCE again I 
claim attention, 
While I 
sing these several lines, 
And a 
motto I 
will mention, 
One of course to suit the times. 
Some folks we're ever meeting, 
Through the world they go on cheek, 
Yet we know in spite of smiling, 
They are drifting down the creek. 
Down the creek, awn the creek, 
They are drifting down the creek. 
There's a 
friend who once had money, 
Now ' tis gone, he wants a 
lift, 
Make his days of darkness sunny, 
Never let him go adrift ; 
Even Grant, the nation's ruler, 
Distant cousins he will seek, 
" 
Dents - 
and presents he will never, 
Send them drifting down the creek. 
Down the creek, down the creek, 
He will never send them down the creek. 
Politicians too are needing, 
To keep open wide their eyes, 
The people's voice they'll soon be hearing, 
That will crush their plots and lies, 
Congress with its shares of railroad, 
leobilier stocks as presents seek, 
Colfax, Ames and all those fellows, 
Send them drifting down the creek ; 
Down the creek, down the creek, 
Send them sailing down the creek. 
In conclusion I 
will mention, 
Should any powers ever strive, 
To tread upon this Yankee nation, 
They'll find the " boys in blue" alive, 
With the niem'ry of our chieftain, 
George Washington of him I 
speak, 
Columbia rushes like a 
whirlwind, 
And sends them drifting down the creek 
Down the creek, down the creek, 
Send them scattering down the creek,

Dinah's Serenade. 
Written by GEORGE NELSON for CUMMINGS and limns, and sung laz 
them with marked success at Harrigan and Hart's. 
HE— 
SHE— 
BOTH— 
Oh Dinah, lovely Dinah, 
On you I 
thought I'd call, 
And ask you if you'd go 
To the darkies' fancy ball. 
Oh yes, I'd feel delighted, 
I'm spoiling for a 
dance, 
What lots of fun we'll have 
If they only give us a 
chance. 
CHORUS. 
Shout on, darkies, shout on, 
Shout on, one and all; 
Shout on, darkies, shout on, 
We're gwine to the ball. 
[REpEAT.] 
Uncle Peter he'll be there, 
With his banjo, I'll be bound, 
knd all the boys and girls 
For miles and miles around. 
We'll dance out in the moonlight, 
So happy, light and gay, 
And never will go home 
Till we see the broke of day. 
Shout on. darkies,

rare amusement for young ladies and gentlemen,

The N. Y. Evening Mail write4C,' 
" 
A 
Little Book has lately appeared in print at Mr. A. 
J. 
FISHER'S, 98 Nos 
sau street, called the " Little Flirt." We 
cannot say that we recommend 
it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, as we think it would only 
encourage the bad habit of" flirting." Unfortunately, there is enough 
of it done without any further necessity of explaining 
how, when and 
where to do it," and this little volume would advise and initiake the un-
corrupted in practicing what is commonly called "flirting." 
The N. Y. Evening Tel
egram 
writes: " W e 
have 
lately 
seen a neat rfffile' 
book, bound in Morocco leather, costing twenty-five cents, called the 
"Little Flirt," published by A. 
J. 
FISHER, No. 98 Nassau Street. 
It 
gives information of the modus operandi of flirting, and of the mean-
ing of every motion of the handkerchief, fan, glove and parasol. As 
there is nothing at all objectionable in the volume, and its contents 
might afford some innocent amusement to many, we do not hesitate to 
recommend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers."

quism is an art depending entirely on practice. Any person having

Prof. E. D. Davies, whose fame is equally great in Europe and America— 
can become proficient by application, it is an art which affords so

for Knave, and numbers 1, 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
four rows, and are to be read according to directions. 
Many of the an. 
ewers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under-
standing. 
Many professional Fortune-Tellers use these cards, and we 
are in receipt of letters in relation to them from all parts of the U. S.

iCourting Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such e 
way as to be non-co.nmittal. 
Many young ladies are visited by :stlemen who are either too diffi-
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. 
The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unladylike encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
' 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. 
This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi. 
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes a 
further explanation un-
necessary. 
The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties
