My heart's forever thinking of dem old times rocks! 
Gone is myAionle k'w

There I 
was gay and happy as could be. 
Grief comes along and at my door it knocks, 
I 
never more shall see again dem old times rocks. 
I'm sighing, 
Where is de stream by my little cabin door-? 
Where are de birds that I 
never hear no more ? 
New times hab come, but my grief dey only mocks, 
I'm weeping for de happy scenes of old times rocks. 
I'm sighing, etc. 
Once I 
was .yqungo,vicl de banjo by my side;

The Music of this song is published by GEO. M OLINEUX, 37 Fourth St.. 
Brooklyn, E. D., New York. Price 35 cents. 
I'sR a 
longing for de good ole times we used to hab of yore 
When we labor'd in de cotton and de corn, 
And eb'ry night de darkeys gather'd ' round de cabin door 
To de calling of de mellow bugle horn; 
We would dance and we would sing to de banjo's happy ring, 
De ole fiddle and de bones made music too, 
And eb'ry charming yaller gal would to her lover cling, 
While all our hearts were honest, kind and true. 
CHORUS. 
We would dance and we would sing to de banjo's happy ring, 
De ole fiddle and de bones made music too, 
And eb'ry charming yaller gal would to her lover cling, 
While all our hearts were honest, kind and true. 
Our ole massa used to like de fun, and laugh'd to see de reels 
Dat de boys and gals were always sure to dance, 
And when de " piccaninny nigs" would turn upon dar heels, 
De ole man would j'ine dem in dar merry prance; 
Tho' he used to give us blows when among de cotton rows, 
He was kind to ifs when daily toil was o'er, 
And eb'ry one dat workV upon de ole plantation knows 
His heart was bigger den our sunny shore. 
We would dance, etc. 
We have heard he j'ined de army after sending us away, 
And was killed in battle down in Tennessee, 
And some one else has tole us dat dey heard ole missus say 
He was sleeping ' neath de ole palmetto tree; 
If de last report is so, all of us would gladly go 
And shed upon his grave a 
friendly tear, 
For ever since we left him we have felt de keenest woe, 
Dar's nothing for de worn-out darkey here. 
We would dance, etc. 
OLD TIME'S ROCKS. 
Banjo Solo sung by BILLY W PM . 
The way we travel now-a-days, 
Surprises us with its different ways. 
In Chicago they go it by pitch and toss, 
You can jump off for ten minutes 
And:get a 
Divorce. 
CHORUS. 
Then it's old Time's Rocks is number one, 
Oh how is that for High. 
The Telegraph workers are on a 
striXe, 
The way things are working 
They don't seem to like. 
The last message thy sent I 
think was a 
stunner, 
To fight it out on one wire if it took all summer. 
Then it's, 4.4rde. 
Oh, Fisk, the Erie Prince, is pie, 
He's always exclaiming, " How's that for high." 
I 
hear from Alaska he's buying up bears. 
But in Jersey they've snatched him 
For raising the fares. 
Then it's, ite. 
The Mormons they have had a 
flare, 
Each other's opinions to pieces they tear. 
Brigham Young still coos like an old turtle dove. 
Says he's coming on North, 
To go in for free love.

THE RUSTIC DAMSEL. 
00MIC BANJO SONG. 
Written by W ALTER HOWARD, and sung by HARRY STANWOOD. 
A 
LONG time to come, I 
remember it well, 
All alone in the workhouse this beauty did dwell, 
With her father and mother she lived all serene, 
Her age it was red and her hair was nineteen. 
Now she had a 
lover, who close by did dwell, 
A bow-legged rustic and hump-backed as well, 
He said, " fly with me now by the light of you star, 
For you are the eye of my apple you are." 
But this beautiful maiden said gently, " be wise, 
My father would scratch out my nails with his eyes. 
If you love me so, you'll not brim:, me to disgrace," 
Sobbed the maiden, as she buried her hand in his face. 
So, so she refused him, he knocked down this maid, 
She suddenly opened the knife with his blade; 
He next cut the throat of this damsel so fair, 
Then dragged her along by the head of the hair. 
Now just at this moment, the old man appears, 
And he gazed on the sight with eyes in his tears; 
Re knelt down beside her, and her cold face he kissed, 
Then rushed with his throat at the murderer's fist.

How well I

'FLIRTING IN TIIE TWILIGHT. 
SONG .A.ND DANCE. 
011, I'111 very fond of roving 
When the stars are in the sky, 
And a 
heart so true and loving 
Often meets me on the sly. 
Thelweetegt'words she whispers, 
And her eyes are sparkling blue ; 
But what she says you may be sure 
never tell to you. 
Oh, we wander while the shadows fall, 
But a 
pair 'a eyes they are my light; 
Of all the joys, it'beats them all, 
This flirting in the twilight. 
C110IIUS. 
Oh, my heart kept going pit-a-pat, (
Break.) 
I 
scarce cOtild tell what I-was at, -; (
Break.) 
We wandered in the shadows, 
But her heat-Mpg eyes they are my light; 
Of joys we meet, there's none so sweet 
As flirting in the twilight. 
Now I 
called her pet and dearest, 
And I 
could not tell you half, 
And said she was the nearest, 
Then she laughed a 
little laugh. 
My arm I 
kindly offered, 
Then'l offered her my hand, 
And said she'd make her darling one 
The happiest in the land. 
There was a 
darkness in the pleasant air, 
But her beaming eyes they are my ; 
I 
kissed her ere she was aware, 
While flirting in the tWilight: 
Oh, my heart, etc. 
Now I 
never can forget her, 
Nor her dear enticing way, 
Near the place where I 
have met her 
I 
wander eyery day. 
My heart is in her keeping, 
She has stolen that, I 
know ; 
But she really makes a 
very sweet 
And fascinating beau 
Sp we wander in the darkness yet, 
- 
But her charming eyes they are my liaht; 
My heart was caught in Cupid's net, 
While 'flirting in the twilight. —

Why he like others am not gay, 
What causes the tear to flow down his cheek

My story, darkies, you shall hear, 
For in ray memory fresh it dwells,

will cause you all to drop a 
tear 
On the grave of my sweet Kitty Wells. 
CHORUS. 
While the birds were singing in the morning, 
And the myrtle and the ivy- were in bloom, 
And the sun on the hill was a 
dawning, 
It was then we laid her in the tomb. 
never shall forget the day, 
That we together roamed the dells, 
I 
kissed her cheek, and named the day 
That I 
should marry Kitty Wells. 
But death came in my cabin door, 
And took from me my joy and pride, 
And when I 
found she was no more, 
I 
laid my banjo down and cried. 
While the birds, 
I 
often wish that I 
was de ad, 
And laid beside her in the tomb. 
The sorrow that bows down my head 
Is silent in the midnight gloom.

ICARCHING THROUGH GEORGIA. 
By permission of ROOT and CADY. 
Bring the good old bugle, boys! we'll sing another song— 
Sing it with that spirit that will start the world along— 
Sing it as we used to sing it fifty thousand strong, 
While we were marching through Georgia. 
CHORUS. 
" 
Hurrah! hurrah! we bring the Jubilee I 
Hurrah! Hurrah! the flag that makes you free!" 
So we sing the chorus from Atlanta to the sea, 
While we were marching through Georgia. 
How the darkies shOuted when they heard the joyful sound! 
How the turkeys gobbled which our commissary found! 
How the sweet potatoes even started from the ground, 
While we were marching through Georgia. 
Hurrah, hurrah ! &e. 
Yes, and there were Union men who wept with joyful tears, 
When they saw the honored flag they had not seen for years; 
Hardly could they be restrained from breaking off in cheers, 
While we were marching through Georgia. 
Hurrah, hurrah! &c. 
" 
Sherman's dashing Yankee boys will never reach the coast r 
So the saucy rebels said, and 'twas a 
handsome boast, 
Had they not forgot, alas, to reckon with the host, 
While we marching through Georgia. 
Hurrah, hurrah! &c. 
So we made a 
thoroughfare for Freedom and her train, 
Sixty miles in latitude— three hundr, d 
to the main; 
Treason fled before us, for resistance was in vain, 
While we were marching through Georgia. 
Hurrah, hurrah! &c. 
But the march is not vet flni•,hed, nor will we let disband, 
While still a 
trace of treason remains to curse the land, 
Or any foe against the flag uplifts a 
threatening hand, 
For we've been marching through Georgia. 
Hurrah, hurrah ! &c. 
When Right is in the White House and Wisdom in her seat 
The reconstructed Senators and Congress men to greet, 
Why then we may stop marching, and rest our weary feet, 
For we've been marching Through 
Georgia. 
Hurrah, hurrah 1 &a.

THE TWO SARAHS. 
Sung by LESTER and ALT Ili 
Oa, I 
really think I 
shall go mad; 
I 
don't know- what to do; 
I'm in love with a 
charming girl; 
We're to be wed in a 
week or two; 
She is the darling of my heart; 
With her I'm dead in love; 
She's the sweetest girl for miles around, 
And I 
call her my turtle-dove. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, my, you should see my Sarah— 
Eyes so bright and teeth so white, 
The fairest in the land ; 
Oh, no, none could be so fair; 
Oh, banty toes and turn-up nose— 
My little Sarah Ann. 
Oh, we've known each other ever so long, 
And the first time that we met, 
I 
helped to push the barrel along, 
And the rain came down quite wet; 
I 
helped to push the barrel along, 
Until we got to the door; _ 
She gave me a 
penny to treat myself, 
Because she couldn't afford any more. 
Oh, my, etc.

Far you well, white folks, we can no longer stay; 
We're off for New Orleans before the break of day.

THE POOR OLD SLAVE. 
'Tis just one year ago to-day, 
That I 
remember well, 
I 
sat down by poor Nelly's side 
A 
story she did tell; 
'Twas about a 
poor unhappy slave 
, That lived for many a 
year, 
kut now he's dead and in his grave, 
No master does he fear. 
CHORUS. 
The poor old slave has gone to sea, 
We know that he is free, 
Disturb him not, but let him rest 
Way down in Tennessee. 
She took my arm, we walked along 
Into an open field, 
And she paused to breathe awhile, 
Then to his grave did steal. 
She sat down by that little mound, 
And softly whispered there, 
Come to me, father, 'tis thy child,

Poor Nelly that was my bride,

That it might shelter me.

SING LOW, SWEET CHILDREN. 
A COLORED CAMP MEETING SONG. 
Written by Wu. H. DELEEtANTY and sung by DELEHANTY and il.ENGLEB. 
I TOOK a 
stroll one afternoon, 
Sweet chil Iren hear dis tale, 
'Twas in the latter part of June, 
Children, mark dis tale. 
I 
sat me down beside a 
stream, 
Children, hear me thro', 
I 
somehow seemed to sleep and dream, 
That dream I'll tell to you. 
CHOEUS . 
Sing low, sweet children, 
The angels soon will come, 
Sing low, sweet children— 
They're coming to take me home. 
This an angel said to me, 
We're coming to take you home, 
Where all are happy, all are free— 
Coming to take you home, 
A (= olden chariot then came down, 
Children, mark dis tale, 
1.nd dere was angels white and browu, 
Sinners, mark dis tale. 
Sing low, etc. 
Angels twined about ray hair 
Flowers wet with dew ; 
A wreath of roses fresh and fair, 
Sweet children hear me thro'. 
Soon they robed me all in white, 
Oh ! the blessed Lamb. 
They set me in the chariot bright, 
Beside the blessed Lamb. 
Sing low, etc, 
Then I 
woke up from my dream, 
Den I 
hove a 
sigh, 
There I 
was beside the stream, 
And tears was in my eye; 
I 
took it for a 
warning sent, 
So I'm prepared to die. 
Don't grieve for me, 
well content, 
And I'm prepared to die. 
Sing low, etc.

DEW D'ANDIES. 
Words by W M. H. 
DELEHANTY. 
Mask by T. 
BRIGHAM BISHOP, 
Now I'm going to tell you all a 
little story, 
But I 
promise you I'll not detain you long; 
It's about a 
darling, charming, little sweet one, 
She's the captivating subject of my song. 
But I'll tell you how we talked and how we flirted, 
When I 
met this belle: 
And ' twas then I 
called her little Dew D'Andies, 
For her name he would not tell. 
CHORES. 
She's so sweet 
and so neat 
Oh I 
love the charming little Dew D'Andiet, 
She's the sweetest girl that ever you did see, 
And she often sings me love among the roses 
Now boys, she's just the girl for me. 
When I 
met her first 'twas out upon a 
pic-nic, 
And I 
shall never forget her winning smile, 
For she danced and made the changes in the music, 
With her graceful pretty fascinating smile. 
Then I 
asked her for her name and her directions, 
For I'd like to call, 
Then she turned around and whispered Dew D'Amlies, 
And she smiling said 'twas all. 
She's so sweet, .1c. 
So, now listen to the sequel of my story,. 
For as time rolled on we dearer friends beeame ; 
And though yet I 
call her little Dew D'Andies, 
I 
am sure she's got another pretty name. 
I 
have placed a 
ring upon her taper finger, 
So we're one, life for life; 
And Rosy May my little Dew D'Andies, 
18 my darling, charming wife. 
She's so sweet, & c.

MY OLD KENTUCKY HOME, Good-night 
[Copyright, 1876, by ROBERT M. 
DE-WITT.] 
A SKETCH FOR TWO CHARACTERS. 
[Scene. a 
wood. 
Enter PETE, an old darkey, with a 
stick and 
bundle over his shoulder. 
The music plays the first strains 
of " Old Kentucky Home.] 
PETE. — Ns a 
long, long road I've trabbled; and I 
don't 
seem to get any nearer to my journey's end. 
I've been north, 
and east, and west; but I 
nebber could content myself. 
Dar's 
no place like de old plantation. eHow many happy days I've 
spent dar! Dar's where my old woman libed long years ago. 
Dar's where my children used to play *round me, and where 
Massa and Misses used to be. 
Oh, de dear old home ! I 
wonder if dar's anyone livin' dar yet. 
No better home on de 
face of de earth. 
I've been gone many a 
year, but I've found 
no home. 
I'm trabbling on to rest dese old bones, under de 
shade of de trees, where I 
used to play when I 
was a 
boy. 
[Going.] 
[Enter MAss.s. CFAPT.ES..] 
CHIELES. — Well, as I 
live, if that isn't old Uncle Pete! He 
won't know me, of course. 
PETE. — I 
heard a 
voice somewhere, sure. 
CR 
iraxs.—Don't you know me, Uncle Pete? 
PE. —No! No! I 
doesn't remember any body in these 
parts. 
I've been gone so long. 
CHAELE,S.—W hy don't you know young Massa Charles, 
that you used to dance on your knee. 
PETE.—You Massa Charles? Well! well! Why I 
shouldn't 
have known you if I 
hadn't seen you! 
CHABLES.—[Adieu.) I 
see the old man is a 
little confused 
in the upper story. 
PETE.—Well ! well! Don't know your face; but I 
suppose 
you's Massa Charles. 
How's de old folks? 
CR4pLEs.—All well, and flourishing; hut the old home is 
ours no more. 
Do you remember the old home, Uncle Pete ? 
PETE. — Do I 
remember it? Ah, yes! 
CrrArax.s.—Do you remember that old song you used to sing 
about it? 
PETE. ----DO I remember it? Oh, how many a time I've 
sung it, as I've jigged along on de road, just to keep up clis 
old heart! 
CHARLES. —Sing it now, Uncle Pete, and it will gladden 
my heart to hear it. 
Peie.—Let me see, how was de tune.

APPLE OF MY EYE. 
Words and Music by W m. H. 
DELEHANTY. 
Oh where, oh where, 
Can all the music be, 
Falling on my ear, 
Floating in the air? 
Or, are the angels 
Singing love to me, 
'Bout Miss Susie Dean, 
The apple of my eye. 
Oh Susie, my darling, 
I 
hope I 
never die; 
That you may live forever, 
The apple of my eye; 
'Twas in the orchard, Susie darling, 
When no one else was nigh, 
I 
called you then ray star and treasure, 
The apple of my eye. 
It fills my soul 
*With joy and ecstacy; 
The mentory is so sweet, 
or when we first did meet. 
The sweetest fruit. 
That ripens on a 
tree, - 
With Susie can't compete, 
The apple of my eye. 
Oh, Susie, my darling, 
I 
hope I 
never die, 
That you may live forever, 
The apple of my eye; 
'Twas in the orchard, Susie darling, 
'When no one else was nigh, 
I 
called yeui then my star and treasure, 
The apple of my eye.

Its mother was weeping, 
For her husband was far on th

er beads while she number'd, 
The baby still slumbered, 
And smiled in her taco as she bended her knee— 
" 
Oh I 
bless'd be that warning, 
My child, thy sleep adorning, 
For I 
know that the angels are whispering to thee." 
" 
And while they are keeping 
Bright watch o'er thy sleeping. 
0! pray to them softly, my baby, with me; 
And say thou wouldst rather 
They'd watch o'er thy father— 
For I 
know that the angels are whispering to thee," 
The dawn of the morning 
Saw Dermot returning, 
And the wife wept with joy her babe's father to see; 
And, closely caressing 
Her child, with a 
blessing, 
Said." I 
know that the angels were whispering to thee."

MISSISSIPPI BOAT SONG. 
Some boats are fast and others slow, 
Stermwheel boats on the Ohio.

So shake her up and let her rip!

And when he,drinks he runs his face.

"ALABAMA JOE,"

lovely girl, 
And I 
thought that she loved me, 
Her mono was Lize, she'd coal black eyes, 
And none could dance like she.

And found it was no go, 
When I 
found out she'd ran away 
With Alabama Joe. 
But in spite of that I 
often think about her. 
My heart is sad since she has gone away, 
But what's the use to grieve, for in that I 
don't believe, 
I'm a 
happy darkey bound to be gay. 
I 
used to take her to all the balls, 
And all the sights in town, 
And everything that she did want 
Of course I 
handed it down ; 
But when the ball was over, 
And the folks began to go, 
She left me standing like a 
stick, 
And away he went with Joe. 
But in spite of that, tlic. 
Now my Lize has left me, 
And she's gone far away, 
And when she did skedaddle 
She took my heart away; 
But if ever she comes back again, 
Oh, marriedme will be, 
And then I'd like to see some " Nig." 
Take that gal from me.

HAPPY NIGGER JOSEPH. 
Composed by Wm. H. DELEITA-NTT. 
Attention please, both one and all, 
And listen to my rhymes ; 
1'11 tell you ' bout things as they are. 
In these pleasant, troublesome times. 
Nothing seems to worry me, 
And that you all must know, 
For I 
spend my time in singing, 
While I 
play the aged banjo. 
Happy nigger Joseph is my name, 
happy nigger Joseph is my cognomen; 
Did you ever see the debbil with his great woods, 
shovel, 
Digging up potatoes with his night-cap on f 
Happy nigger Joe is my signature, 
_Happy nigger Joseph is my autograph ; 
Hey diddle, diddle, the cat broke the fiddle, 
And the cow went up in a 
balloon. 
I 
fell in love with a 
nice young girl, 
Kit Burns was her name ; 
A bully little girl with a 
big glass eye, 
She walked a 
trifle lame. 
I 
whispered love into her ear, 
Brought her oysters by the keg; 
Besides a 
terrible Grecian bend, 
She swings a 
wooden hoof. 
Happy nigger Joe don't want it. 
Joyous nigger man wouldn't have it; 
Ding dong gaily on your own benzine, 
To meet Johnny Booker on the Bowling Greer 
I 
strut in my long tail blue, 
'When the swallows homeward flew. 
When day's work's done I 
had my run, 
With the wickedest man in New York. 
This hunky girl was sweet sixteen, 
As gentle as a 
camel; 
With eyes as black as the driven snow, 
And a 
mouth like a 
railroad tunnel. 
She looked so neat and dressed so sweet, 
while walking down the street; 
With Bismark shoes as big as mine, 
And a 
rattling set of false teeth. 
Then not for Joe, not any, 
I'm well supplied, you bet ; 
There's a 
rose in th e garden for you, young man, 
I 
can't hold the plow, but I'll do the best I 
can.

There is just complaint among teachers and parents who take an interest in 
the culture of youth, because of the very few books that exist containing first 
class Dialogues for two or more speakers. 
Most of this class of books are 
mere repetitions of books printed scores of years ago; while others omit all 
old ones, however good, and fill their places with weak, wishy-washy pieces 
merely because they are new. In this series the aim has been to select the 
Best, whether new or old—pieees as fresh as daisies and as bright as stars.

DE WITT'S " SCHOOL" SPEAKERS 
Neith,er talent, labor nor mow 
have been spared in producing this series 
of books .for youths. 
The result m 
that they excel all others both in, quality 
and quantity of superior reading, while none others approach them in 
neat printing and general appearance. 
Nothing would warrant such an 
nttlay but the enormous number sold, the price being only Ten Cents 
Por each book. 
Wo. I. DE WITT'S " PRIMARY" SCHOOL SPEAKER. 
This book is made up entirely of short pieces. 
Each article is exactly lilted, both In 
Ideas, sentiment and words, to interest, instroct and amuse the youngest reader and 
speaker. 
Every piece has been carefully garnered and winnowed from the best har-
vests of the best writers for youthful minds. 
No. 2. DE WITT'S " PUBLIC" SCHOOL SPEAKER. 
This work will be found well calculated for a 
grade of speakers a 
little more advanced 
than the " Primary." Many at the articles have been purposely written for these e 
pages by authoi s 
of approved ability ; others carefully culled from the hooks of leading 
writers in either hemisphere. Care has been taken that every doubtful phrase and 
sentiment, however brilliaut, should be eliminated from every line of this series. 
No. 3. DE WITT'S " EXHIBITION" SCHOOL SPEAK-
er. 
This work is for a 
grade of pupils still higher in intellect and learning than No. 2, 
The ideas and language are both more advanced, the selectione being made with the 
intention of rendering the work just the thing to place in the hands of pupils desiring 
to recite in halls of Academies and other places of education. 
It has been successfully 
aimed in this book to instil worthy seutimeuts while aiding in the cultivation of the 
forensic powers. 
No. 4. DE WITT'S " PATRIOTIC" SCHOOL SPEAK-
en. The finest, most poetical, most ardent apostrophes to Home, Liberty, Union, In-
dependence, will be found in this book. 
While specimens are given of the patriotic 
epics of other lands, our selections are mainly taken from the lyrics of our own great 
poets—poets who have poured out their burning phrases like molten lava streams, 
filling every American youth's heart with the idea 
"That the rude whirlwind and the torrent's roar 
But bind him to his 'Wive hills the more." 
No.5. DE W ITT'S " DRAMATIC" SCHOOL SPEAK 
er. 
This book furniehes a 
much needed collection of the most justly popular pieces 
in the language—pieces as remarkable for the parity of the sentiment as the chaste 
eloquence of the phrases. 
They are all characterized by strength, eloquence, and, in 
many instance., by gtandeur of expressioo. 
All of the articles are eminently fitted 
for oratorical practice end display in Private as well as Public Schools, Academies 
and other institutions at education. 
No. 6._ DE WITT'S " COMIC" SCHOOL SPEAKER. 
This most arousing hook includes ill its pages a 
great number of the beet humorous 
pieces in the language. They are of all shades of fun, from the most delicate play-
fulness to the most broadly farcical, but all full of the very spirit of harmless jollity. 
While some of the pieces are those old standard recitatione that never tire or stale by 
repetition, many others are full of the new and fresh, anti original humor of the time,.
