When Nature u

Of jarring a

And could not heave h

The tuneful voice was heard from h

Arise, ye more than dead."

Music was l
ong d
istinctive among the E
uropean arts for i
ts
 
universality and catholicity. More than l
iterature or the v
isual arts,
 
music was s
een as a semi-divine creation w
ith godlike a
ttributes and
 
powers. The S
irens, Orpheus, a
nd S
t. Cecilia p
ersonify the felt
 
transcendence of music beyond earthly r
ealms.

Synthesizers and boom boxes are today's equivalents of the battle-ax, the
 
r
ack, the trepanning saw, and the cat-o'-nine-tails; "
no one i
s safe from
 
music." Where Holst s
tressed s
ilence, h
is P
lanets Suite i
s now touted for
 
i
ts noisiness, "
brought to l
ife w
ith s
tunning l
ights & special effects,
 
p
lus themes from S
tar Trek, C
lose E
ncounters, & Star Wars." 5 
I
n the past, music was more d
ivine than i
nfernal. The S
irens whose
 
sweet songs l
ured ►
J
lysses were daughters of Hades and angels of death, y
et
 
they a
lso s
teered souls to heaven. Atop each of e
ight celestial r
ings, i
n
 
P
lato's myth of E
r, a s
iren sang one note as s
un, s
tars, and p
lanets
 
r
evolved; to their combined harmony the three F
ates chanted of past,
 
present, a
nd future. 5 As w
inged women w
ith feathered l
egs who bore k
ithara
 
a
nd a
ulos i
n their c
laws, s
irens were Lorelei as well a
s Harpy precursors.
 
Orpheus, a Thracian k
ing's son by the muse Calliope, not only l
ured
 
w
ild beasts w
ith h
is l
yre b
ut enticed trees and even r
ocks; to r
eclaim
 
E
urydice from Hades, he charmed Charon a
nd the gods of the underworld.
 
Orpheus's magical l
yre had b
een made by Hermes, go-between of gods and men,
 
to r
ecompense cows f
ilched from Apollo; the l
yre's s
even s
trings sounded
 
the s
even phases of the spheres. After Orpheus was d
ismembered by the
 
Maenads i
n punishment for h
is r
ejection of women, h
is head went on s
inging
 
u
ntil Apollo bade i
t cease meddling w
ith the gods. F
lung to the sky, h
is
 
l
yre became our familiar s
tarry constellation. A
ll men were mesmerized by
 
i
t, wrote Macrobius, "
for the soul carries w
ith i
t i
nto the body a memory
 
of the music which i
t k
new i
n the s
ky." How apt that the Australian l
yre-
b
ird today m
imics the chain-saw devastating the forest-home of this
 
antipodean c
uckoo. ? 
The awkward Orphic a
lloy of Apollonian r
eason a
nd D
ionysian ecstasy
 
exemplifies early Christian ambiguity toward music. The medieval Church
 
proscribed i
nstrumental music as satanic enchantment; a
s l
ate as the 1
9th
 
5
 
century Paganini, the "
wandering Orpheus," was s
uspected of owing h
is
 
genius to having sold h
is soul to the devil. Yet Orpheus was a
lso conflated
 
w
ith Christ, often shown w
ith a l
yre, the wooing of beasts echoing the
 
s
hepherd/Savior, the descent to Hades l
ikened to Christ's h
arrowing of
 
Hell. A i
n  Striggio's l
ibretto for Monteverdi's opera, Orfeo a
scends l
ike
 
Christ i
nto heaven, forgoing corporeal wedded b
liss to become one w
ith the
 
gods.
 
I
nitially held averse to music on account of i
ts s
inister s
irens, the
 
Roman convert Cecilia became i
ts patron saint i
n the 1
6th century; by
 
s
inging to God i
n her heart while s
uffering martyrdom, she a
ttracted a
n
 
a
ngel to earth. As Orpheus i
n Christian form, Cecilia's powers exceeded
 
h
is: "
He r
aised a mortal to the skies; / She drew an angel down." Dryden's
 
St. Cecilia conflates the music of the spheres w
ith the heavenly choir,
 
Job's "
morning s
tars [
that] sang together." Music moved hearers i
n various
 
ways, as specified by the drums a
nd trumpets, f
lutes and v
iolins i
n
 
Handel's 1
739 s
etting for Dryden's ode.9

I
I. Music Orphic and universal
  
The Orphic tradition changed profoundly over two m
illennia between ancient
 
A
thens and the E
nlightenment. From the mystical i
t came to celebrate the
 
r
ational, from the d
ivine the h
uman, from man's F
all h
is triumph. Once the
 
f
lux of d
ivine passion, music became an emblem of s
in a
nd sacrifice, then
 
of r
ational progressive science -- Dryden's d
iapason "
closing full i
n man."
 
B
ut Orphic effects a
ll a
long r
emained universal. General harmonic
 
l
aws were i
nvoked to ban Ionian a
nd L
ydian modes a
s too l
ax for P
lato's
 
Republic (
Dorian and Phrygian a
lone were a
llowed). The a
coustic r
atios that
 
made music one of the mathematical quadrivia of medieval s
chooling were
 
held to shape a
ll-pervasive powers. Baroque theory l
inked paradise w
ith E
 
major a
s the s
harpest key; l
ent F m
inor, the f
lattest, i
ts deathly,
 
i
nfernal r
epute; forged Masonic bonds w
ith the k
ey of E f
lat; and embroiled
 
champions of ,
j
ust i
ntonation against those of equal temperament. 1
0 Whatever
 
music meant i
t made s
uperhuman sense, mediating b
etween heaven and earth,
 
transcending the parochial, enlarging a
ll of l
ife.
 
HI. Music u
nconstrained by political boundaries
  
L
ike i
ts founding l
egends, Western music became universal i
n practice.
 
Though p
itch varied w
ith p
lace, Orpheus sang to h
is l
yre a
like i
n
 
Monteverdi's Mantua and i
n Stravinsky's Los Angeles, S
t. Cecilia s
ustained
 
music i
n Paris and London as i
n Rome. Freedom of movement r
eflected music's
 
u
niquely non-parochial nature. To be s
ure, song a
nd opera wed music to
 
words a
nd i
mages. B
ut music as s
uch transcended the tribal d
ivisions that
 
afflicted other human d
iscourse after Babel, when God s
et each ethnos apart
 
b
ehind i
ts own l
inguistic barricade.
 
More than a
ny other art, music breached barriers of culture a
nd
 
politics. Musicians habitually s
tudied and taught abroad; composers a
nd
 
p
erformers were besought out of their own l
ands. No freemasonry of painters
 
7
 
or poets, s
culptors or architects matched that of musicians. As
 
cosmopolites p
ledged to their muse beyond constraints of b
irthplace or
 
homeland, musicians were a
lmost u
niquely exempt from petty particularism.
 
Whether a music-maker was German or I
talian, E
nglish or Russian,
 
hardly mattered to patrons and i
mpresarios. Special talents were noted --
I
talian vocalists, German i
nstrumentalists -- b
ut their exemplars were
 
exported r
ound the world. Music "
became the property of a
ll E
uropeans,"
 
concluded Romain Rolland, because i
n i
t "
all r
aces have collaborated." 1
1 
Composers and performers s
till r
emain more u
niversal, l
ess culture-bound,
 
than poets, p
laywrights or painters.
 
I
C
I. The absent past
  
Over t
ime as over terrain, music opened catholic arms. A cohesive canon
 
s
tretched from baroque through r
omantic; the whole c
lassical r
epertoire was
 
p
erceived and performed as one grand unified enterprise. But while music's
 
spatial spread had ancient r
oots, the broad temporal r
ange was a 1
9th-
century novelty.
 
Awareness of past music had l
ong l
agged behind the o
ther arts.
 
Renaissance poets and painters, s
culptors and architects g
loried i
n the
 
a
ntique. B
ut musicians who c
laimed to admire a
ntiquity could neither
 
r
etrieve nor r
evive i
t. W
ithout common ways of transcribing, nothing could
 
be saved a
nd passed on. So d
im was the l
ight of antique music "
that many
 
consider i
ts wonderful excellence a dream and a fable," wrote V
incenzo
 
Galilei. And medieval music that d
id s
urvive was i
naccessible i
n notations
 
l
ater musicians could not decipher. 1
,
9 
Once a p
iece of music s
topped being performed i
t was l
ost. The most
 
"
ancient" music k
nown to Galilei, i
n 1
581, dated from early i
n the same
 
century. As l
ate as 1
776 London's Concert of Antient Music, founded to k
eep
 
past music from falling i
nto oblivion, i
nsisted that works on i
ts programs
 
8
 
be over twenty years o
ld -- an age seemingly v
iewed a
s hoary. 1
3 "
Classical"
 
tradition i
n music meant entreaties to r
eplace barbaric "
recent" music --
polyphony -- w
ith a s
ingle s
inging voice backed by i
nstrumental continuo.
 
This nuova manieri d
i canti was famously i
nnovated i
n the P
ellegrina 
i
ntermedii a
t a 1
589 Medici wedding. 1
4 
Hence the prevalent v
iew that only what was contemporary was any
 
good. I
n 1
477 T
inctoris declared that "
there does not exist a s
ingle p
iece
 
of music, not composed w
ithin the l
ast forty y
ears, that i
s .
.. worth
 
h
earing." That this made music a
nomalous Renaissance worthies were keenly
 
aware. "
How s
trange that we f
ind i
n music a s
ituation entirely d
ifferent,"
 
wrote L
uscinius; "
in the arts and l
etters...whatever comes c
losest to
 
venerable antiquity r
eceives most praise; i
n music, he who does not excel
 
the past becomes the l
aughing s
tock of a
ll." Some not only s
corned the
 
a
ncients, but "
will not examine a song u
nless i
t has just r
ecently
 
come... s
till g
lowing from the a
nvil." Moderns were praised for r
idding
 
music of past abuses; a confrere commended W
illaert for p
urging the
 
"
blemishes of antiquity." i
5 Not u
ntil the l
ate-16th century was a
ny earlier
 
work admired; even the l
ate-18th l
auded only a handful of r
ecent
 
precursors.
 
This b
linkered v
iew of the past l
ong endured owing to l
ack of access
 
to texts or i
nability to r
ead them. Rare exceptions were Josquin des Pr¢s,
 
preserved i
n 1
5th-century printed editions, and Palestrina, a sainted
 
pedagogic i
con. B
ut Dufay and Machaut, a
long w
ith earlier composers, were
 
u
navailable or i
llegible. Not u
ntil the 1
9th century d
id scholars l
earn to
 
r
ead early polyphonic notation. 1
6
 
V.  Creating an i
nclusive canon
  
D
uring the n
ineteenth century, a growing body of p
ast a
long w
ith present
 
music formed a s
tandard performance collection. No l
onger d
id new music
 
9
 
c
onsign o
ld to oblivion; i
t was n
ow grafted on to a
n e
nduring r
epertoire.
 
H

eethoven were n
ot s
upplanted by B
rahms b
ut k
ept their p
lace
 
i
n a
n i
mmortal a
nd e
lastic canon.
 
A
t f
irst, to b
e s
ure, the o
ld was not very o
ld; i
t was mainly what
 
moderns s
aw a
s their r
oots, a
t f
irst not even earlier than Handel. Not

That assimilative tradition i
s now much eroded. E

d
ifference, music makers and hearers eschew the omnium gatherum for
 
specific periods and p

ifferentiated f

then by h
istory amd epoch, i
ncreasingly abridges the cosmopolitan h

National d
ifferences earlier of small note became crucial to popular
 
nationalism. "

musical expression, i

eld a Scottish ballad
 
collector i
n 1
776 -- traits derived from "
climate and government, character
 
and s
ituation." A century l
ater, a German emigr6 i
n London endorsed music
 
"
composed i
n the peculiar taste of the nation," appealing s
trongly to
 
national feeling a
nd "
pre-eminently cultivated" i
n "
popular songs a
nd
 
dance-tunes traditionally preserved." So far had the cosmopolitan tradition
 
r
eceded by the 1
930s that F
urtwangler could c

I. P
eriod particularism
 
I
n contrast to i
ts 1
9th-century breadth, music i
s now much s
egregated by
 
epoch. D
ifferent eras get separate concerts. Going or gone i
s the eclectic
 
potpourri of familiar c

tandard performing r
epertory w

P
urcell followed by Strauss's A
lpine Symphony, or Boulez i
nterleaved w
ith
 
Mozart. Now the fashion i
s for programmes s
erved i
n p
ure period s
tyle.
 
Stress on h
istorical authenticity fragments performance needs and
 
i
nstrumental demands. Period experts are l
ess able or more r
eluctant to
 
s
witch their approach, l
et a
lone a
lter their p
itch, to earlier or l
ater
 
epochs. The i
ncongruity was noted (
but d
isregarded) even i
n 1
838: "
Very few
 
p
ianists can perform the o
ld music of Scarlatti a
nd especially of B
ach,
 
because the f
ingering habits i
t r
equires are a
lmost i

nachronisms: b
ack then
 
1

o
ld music got modernized; a c
entury on performers and i
nstruments were
 
a
ntiquated.
 
The E
uropean canon's s
weep through t
ime b
egan to contract a
t the
 
s
tart of the twentieth century. One r
eason was the a
dvent of modern music,
 
which could not or would not f
it i
nto i
t. Atonal a
nd s
erial music
 
deliberately broke w
ith the traditional r
epertoire; after Strauss and
 
Schoenberg, the mainstream ceased to b
e a navigable l
iving r
iver. Unable to
 
grow by accreting modern music, the mainstream canon came to feel l
ike a
 
r
elic of the past, no l
ess cherished b
ut c
learly out of date.
 
V
II. Early music and authenticity
  
One mainstream r
eaction was to s
eek deeper r
oots i
n the past. !
e
nable to go
 
forward, the canon grew backward. But medieval and Renaissance works proved
 
l
ess a
ssimilable than Bach. Early music d
iffered more r
adically i
n
 
dynamics, harmony, i
nstrumentation: a
nd mainstream p
erformance modes were
 
deeply i
ncompatible w
ith early music's own a
llure.
 
Early music b
uffs made f
etishes and facsimiles of a
ncient
 
i
nstruments, too -- i
nstruments i
ll-suited to the s
tandard concert s
tage.
 
Some could scarcely be heard; others demanded d
iscordant tuning or bowing.
 
L
ike early music i
tself, l
ute and shawm had to b
e h
eard on their own, not
 
as a
djuncts to the s
tandard ensemble.
 
By 1
950 early music, no l
ess than modern, was r
emote from the
 
mainstream. I
ts devotees were s
een as a breed apart, amateurs ,
joining
 
professionals not just on r
ecorders b
ut i
n an entire much-parodied l
ife-
s
tyle: bearded gurus and d
irndled f
lower children g
iven to brown r
ice a
nd
 
muesli, sandals and s
tripped wood i
n a post-Pre-Raphaelite i
dyll. Ancient
 
i
nstruments bespoke nature i
n their r
eedy quavers and organic constituents,
 
wood and gut and i
vory, things grown, n
ot m
ined or machined.41
 
1

A cult of a
uthenticity s
uffused early music from the 1
950s. D
evotees
 
who shunned the mainstream c
laimed to make music a
s i
t had b
een -- or had
 
been wanted. This was how i
t should b
e h
eard; i
n L
andowska's famous phrase,
 
"
You p
lay Bach your way. I
'll p
lay Bach h
is way." To be s
ure, authentic
 
angst seldom s
tifled early music even then; K
erman r
ecalls that Noah
 
Greenberg's Pro Musica performance of the medieval P
lay of D
aniel was
 
i
nterspersed w
ith comments on E
nglish a
lliterative verse, by W
.H. Auden,
 
dressed i
n a cassock. d
 2
? 
Authenticity today i
s not ,
j
ust a musical cult; i
t p
ervades a
ll the
 
arts, anthropology, h
istory, tourism, even cuisine. I
t r
eflects Western
 
r
evulsion a
t mass-produced commodities and nostalgia for what feels r
eal or
 
original as opposed to contrived a
nd self-conscious, for what i
s tribal
 
r
ather than i
mperial. I
t i
s a
lso s
elf-defeating, a contradiction i
n terms;
 
a
nything touted as authentic a
t once becomes i
nauthentic because so-called.
 
"
But the l
abel said a
uthentic," complains the b
uyer of a fake. "
That s
hould
 
have b
een your f
irst c
lue." 43  
'
 And original i
ntent i
s a frail r
eed a
t b
est -
 
- musicans i
nterpret their own music s
everal d
ifferent ways.
 
Authenticity i
n early music i
s specially futile. Much of i
t was n
ot
 
written down or even "
composed" b
ut i
mprovised by l
ibrettists and
 
performers, more l
ike jazz than c
lassical. Some written music was not meant
 
to be p
layed; Bach's B m
inor Mass was g
iven to the E
lector of Saxony as a
 
promotional portfolio, hence "
the most `
authentic' approach to [
it] i
s not
 
to perform i
t a
t a
ll, but to r
ead the s
core a
nd consider Bach for the job
 
of maestro d
i capella i

ocal church." 4

ccreting new music felt to be continuous w
ith the o
ld, what musicians
 
took a
s "
enduring tradition" was l
ikewise updated by current conceptions.
 
B
ut today, holds Robert Morgan, the past i
s no l
onger "
a continuous
 
corridor; i
t has become a f
ield of i
nstantaneous possibilities" from which
 
to conjure. The work of composers l
ike Wuorinen, Davies, Foss, Henze,
 
Z
immerman i
s l
aced w
ith a
llusions to the past, a post-modern collage that
 
juxtaposes new w
ith o
ld i
dioms. I
n Conrad Cummings' opera E
ros and P
syche,
 
an 1
8th-century quartet i
s tuned to baroque p
itch, a fraction l
ower than
 
the
 a
 orchestra

h
_ modern p
it  r
chest._ p
laying a
_  h_ s_m_ t
ime.
 
Such features make music today more l
ike the other arts, embedded i
n
 
cultural context and t
ime-bound l
anguage hostile to Orphic u
niversalism.
 
E
ven the concept of a mainstream canon becomes pass6. Not only does early
 
music now escape traditional performance, so does Mozart; even Beethoven
 
a
nd Brahms cease to be "
ours" when c
laimed by period specialists. The
 
expanding archival past shrinks the l
iving l
egacy; what was once
 
transmitted can now only b
e c
ited. Truncating the continuing tradition
 
makes i
t harder to hear
 
except

Yet a cosmopolitan tradition does s
urvive. The early music fraternity i

i
nstruments once s

s quaint -- harpsichord a

early music goes mainstream, one no l
onger h
ears g
ibes that baroque s

p
erformers are those who failed to make the grade i
n the s
ymphony
 
orchestra. 5
6
 
Music a

s next enjoyed as d

The cosmopolitan tradition outlasts nationalism too. The most f
