OUR FRONT STOOP. 
Words and music by ED. HARRIGAN, as sung in his great play, 
"Sullivan's Christmas." 
Copyright secured 1878, by 
Harrigan & Hart. 
Music published by Wm. 
Pond, 547 Broadway, New York. 
Pm the father of a 
family, 
Six girls and one big boy, 
With the neighbors they are friendly 
They are their mother's joy ; 
It's every summer evening, 
When the heat would make you droop; 
Friends there meet from every street 
To gossip on our front stoop. 
'There's dainty Misses Grogan, 
Alexander McAfee, 
The undertaker Hogan, 
The pride of Calvary. 
Such splendid vocalization, 
'Twould burst an opera troupe; 
The Sweet By and By would make a 
man die, 
As sung on our front stoop. 
They talk about the .Murphys, 
And say they put on style, 
And how their daughter Mary 
Went down to Coney Isle 
With a 
German music teacher, 
Who filled her with clam soup, 
Then they say, don't give it away, , 
What you hear on our front stoop. 
You'd have to run the gauntlet, 
If ye were walking by, 
They'd have your family history 
In the twinkling of an eye. 
They'd turn you gently over, 
While they sit there in a 
group, 
They'd give to you sweet Ballyhoo, 
While passing our front stoop. 
They send Kate with a 
pitcher, 
For Cincinnati beer ; 
Then their conversation 
For a 
mile or two you'll hear, 
They talk about the babies, 
The whooping coughs and croup, 
When the moon's out in sight, they say good night, 
And go home from our front stoop. 
By ED. HARRIGAN. AS 
sung by HARRIGAN 8: HART. 
(Air—" Gliding Down the Stream.") 
One year ago my Willie 
Gently took a 
sail, 
As far as Blackwell's Island, 
He couldn't find no bail; 
He'd been h'isting sour mashes, 
Till he got on too much steam, 
In a 
Bellevue ferry vessel, oh I 
He glided up the stream. 
CHORUS. 
Gliding up the stream, 
Oh 1 
how the snoozers scream, 
With bums afloat on a 
Bellevue boat, 
It's a 
ten day dizzy dream; 
Gliding up the stream, 
To wear a 
suit of Jean, 
Oh! what a 
gawk, to leave New York, 
And go gliding up the stream. 
They put him in the baker's— 
My Willie pure as snow, 
And made him count the raisins, 
And stamp down all the dough; 
They cut his curly ringlets, 
Yes, shaved his head off clean, 
To make him look respectable, 
After gliding up the stream. 
Gliding up, etc, 
When Will came from the prison, 
He floated in a 
tank, 
He landed in Astoria, 
On Long Island's grassy bank; 
He fell down on his benders, 
So bad his eye did gleam, 
Saying, " You'll never catch-ee me no more-ee, 
Gliding up the stream." 
Gliding up, etc. /

The Injun Will Cut Down the Army Oh! 
Written by EDWARD H ARRIGAN. 
As performed by HARRIGAN k HART. 
We're the boys dressed in blue, we stand forninst you, 
hearty and well, wid a 
strong appetite, 
Out in the far west where the sun goes to rest, 
Sent by the government the injins to fight. 
The man with two horses and big Sitting Bull, 
Nez Perces and Sioux, the woods they are full, 
They skip it away over to Canada 
After they cut down the army, oh ! 
CHORI1s. 
But Congressmen say, reduce our pay, 
In Arizona the blue U. S. A. 
Drive us away—what do you say ? 
The Injun will cut down the army, oh I 
In gulch or ravine on a 
pickle and bean, 
We've waited and waited and watched for poor Lo, 
The barber so red that ' lid shave off your head, 
Till never a 
hair or a 
ringlet would grow. 
Wid his scalpin'-knife he would aise you of life, 
As he'd say ugh- ugh- ugh, and give you the taffy oh, 
Then skip it away over to Canada 
After:he cut down the army, oh! 
But Congressmen, etc. 
There's Joseph the chief, he stole all our beef, 
An' horses an' wagons an' blankets an' clothes, 
While Howard did pray, Big Joe run away, 
And showed us his heels with his hand to his nose 
You can send out your agents an' fat missionaries, 
They'll raze their hair like singing canaries, 
Then skip it away over to Canada, 
After they cut down the army, oh! 
But Congressmen, etc. 
The man wid one eye and white man ate pie, 
Wid tall grass and mule's foot an' cheese it one day, 
The roaring cayote, and Chatham street boot 
Are Apacha warriors in Arizona. 
They have councils of war, where they smoke the big pipes you 
know, 
Fixin' the date for the hair of your head to grow. 
Then skip it away over to Canada, 
After they cut down the army, oh! 
But Congressmen, etc. 
HOTEL DE VARSELAY. 
By Ell. HARRIGAN. 
Sung by all the Eastern-bound Fleweys. 
I'm living at a 
boarding-house 
Up n 
Houston street, 
Where actors and musicians 
Eat their meals and sleep. 
There the hungry ballet tramp 
That come from Marcela, 
Dancing Danish polkas 
In the Hotel Varselay. 
ClIORUS. 
All night I 
am uneasy, 
No sleep at all I 
get, 
Wid bones and clappers rattling 
And a 
Prussian elarionet. 
They never talk in English, 
But parley vous Franea.y, 
I'll lose my life, upon my soul, 
In the Hotel Varselay. 
When we sat down to breakfast, 
It's Cully, pass me that, 
Or Nixy Weedy, Nibzy, 
Stag the tad wid the diZzy hat. 
They have ,a 
soup caged bullion, 
The butter runs away, 
The boarders holler out for dates 
In the Hotel Varselay. 
All night T. am, etc. 
The other night I 
tried to sleep, 
When a 
man from Calumet 
Came down through the ceiling 
Turning a 
summerset. 
I 
grabbed him by his necktie, 
He " Hay Rube 1 
hay Rube !" did say, 
I 
was kicked by a 
circus company 
From the Hotel Varselay. 
All night I 
am, etc 
I 
went up stairs to get my trunks, 
And have revenge or die, 
When a 
man they called a 
tumbler 
Said, "Shoot him—kill the guy." 
I 
drew a 
knife and grabbed my trunk, 
The French said "Allecushay," 
My trunk was nailed unto the floor 
.1he Hotel Vareslay. 
All night I 
am, etc 
THE RUE DE MULBERRY, 
By ED. HARRIGAN. 
With calm deliberation, 
Without any hesitation, 
I'll give a 
recitation 
Of the Rue de Mulberry. 
From every Gothic winder, 
You can observe its splinder, 
'Tis my duty to defind her— 
The Rue de Mulberry. 
Its buildings are tremendous, 
The population is stupendous, 
The citizens conscientious— 
In the Rue de Mulberry. 
Men from Italiana 
Play harps and the pis.nner, 
In a 
Lazeroner manner, 
In the Rue do Mulberry. 
Policemen from headquarters, 
Watch Italy's fair daughters, , 
And the lager-beer importers— 
In. 
the Rue de Mulberry. 
You could hear an Irish lecture, 
From the neighbors living next yer, 
In the splendid architecture 
Of tha Rue de Mulberry. 
For pugilistic demonstration, 
Of men from every nation, 
The only real location 
Is the Rue de Mulberry. 
'Tis there the solid voters 
Eat eels and Yarmouth bloaters, 
And wear piccadilly chokers— 
In the Rue de Mulberry. 
The perfume of the flowers, 
In the bucket shops and bowers, 
Waft their fragrance a* all hours, 
In the Rue do Mulberry. 
For vast accumulation 
Of a 
mighty aggregation, 
No other congregation 
Equals Rue de Mulberry. 
On Sundays, then, the ladies, 
Taking out their day days, 
With a 
hundred million babies, 
In the Rue de Mulberry. 
Written by ED. HARRIGAN for DICK PAAKER. 
I 
took my gal last Friday fair 
To the Irish Saratoga, 
She'd a 
bathing suit and a 
Dutch spitz dog, 
With a 
head like a 
Russian Czar; 
She wanted to swim in the briny sea, 
She's big as a 
bale of hay, 
I 
made the trip to give her a 
dip 
On the beach at Rockaway. 
We soon got afloat on the Plymouth Rock boat, 
She squatted right down in the bow, 
She eat two hams and a 
hamper of clams— 
That's more than the law would allow; 
She began for to kick when she got sea-sick, 
The first thing I 
heard a 
sailor say— 
" 
Give her ipecac and let's put back, 
Or we'll sink 'fore we reach Rockaway." 
When we got to the beach she began for to screech— 
" 
Look out there! I'm going to make a 
dive I 
She dove on a 
Mick—he gave his last kick, 
As he plumb into China did drive; 
All day she did swim, she wouldn't come in, 
" 
She'll drown !" the people did say, 
She sunk like a 
stone, and left me alone, 
On the beach at Rockaway. 
She floated ashore, and a 
fat coroner, 
Twelve sailors and an Italian band, 
Sat on her all day, and the verdict they say 
Was, she died ' cause she couldn't live on land ; 
Pooty soon she come to, saying, Richard, where are you 
Oh! lovey, take me home on a 
dray, 
I'm sweet sixteen, feed me on cream-, 
Clams are too tough at Rockaway. 
BLUE AND GRAY: 
Oh, mother, what do they mean by blue, 
And what do they mean by gray. 
Was heard from the lips of a 
little child, 
As she bounded in from play. 
The mother's eyes filled up with tears, 
She turned to her darling fair, 
And smoothed away from the sunny brow, 
Its treasures of golden hair. 
Why, mother's eyes are blue my sweet, 
And grandpa's hair is grey, 
And the love we bear our darling child, 
Grows stronger every day; 
But what did they—persisted the child— 
For I 
saw two cripples to-day, 
And one of them said he fought for the blue, 
The other, he fought for the gray. 
Now, he of the blue had lost a 
leg, 
The other had but one arm; 
And both seemed worn and weary and sad, 
Yet their greeting was kind and warm. 
They told of battles of days gone by, 
Till it made my young blood thrill. 
The leg was lost in the Wilderness fight, 
And the arm on Malvern Hill. 
They sat on the stone by the farm-yard gate, 
And talked for an hour more, 
Till their eyes grew bright, and their warm hearts seemed, 
With fighting their battles o'er, 
And parting at last with a 
friendly grasp. 
In a 
kindly, brotherly way; 
Each called on God, to speed the time, 
Uniting the blue and the gray..

THE MIDNIGHT OWLS. 
Comic duet for two swells. 
Sung by HARRIGAN & HART ir1 their great act—London Comic 
Singers. 
We 
are swells of the first water, 
Our dress is quite sublime, 
Admired in every quarter, 
As toffs we cut a 
shine ; 
At night we find much pleasure, 
For the midnight owls are we. 
We are all for life and gaiety 
And devils for a 
spree. 
SPOKEN • — Tom. Yes my dear friends, we are called by the 
snobs of society, and the readers of the Herald, lardy-dardy fel-
lows. 
Jerry, 
Ah, nevah mind what they call us, we'll soon show 
them that— 
CHORUS. 
We are the midnight owls, 
And jolly pals are we, 
We're out all night, in bed all day, 
So happy and so free. 
We drink our bright mosselle, 
And cut the heavy swell. 
Both near and far they say we are 
The dashing Midnight Owls. 
You should see at the races, 
With steppers make a 
show, 
tli 
At billiards, pool or boating, 
The owls are never slow. 
We are devils with the ladies, 
They say , we are divine, 
They take us for some lord or duke 
By jove we but it fine. 
15 
SPOKEN — (Tom.) 
They take me for Lord Sawdust. 
(Jerry). 
Well, what do you think they call me? 
(Tom.) 
I 
haven't the least idea. 
(Jerry.) 
Well, they call me Lord Muttonhead, there's a 
nice 
name to go to bed with. 
Bah! 
(Tora) 
Never mind, Jerry, old boy, what they call us, we'll 
50011 show them that— 
We are the, etc. 
At Long Branch or Saratoga, 
We're in it spruce and smart, 
The ladies throw such glances 
That pierce this noble heart; 
Now, flirting is a 
pleasure, 
There's nothing can compare 
I (you) like the dark-eyed beauties, 
You ( I) prefer the auburn hair. 
SPOKEN.—( Tom.) 
Yes, my dear fellow, I 
like the brunettes. 
(Jerry.) 
And I 
prefer the blondes; but I 
say, Tom, old fel-
lah, we musn't forget our appointment, this evening. 
(Tom.) I 
never knew we had one. 
(Jerry.) 
Oh, yes, my dear boy. 
Evening dress, a

DOT LITTLE SIDE DOOR. 
Written by ED. HARRIGAN, for BONNIE RuNNELLs, and sung by

Y. 
I

Tie loose der little side door." 
What kind of freedom is dot now,

PINE DOMINOES. 
Sung by TONY PASTOR. 
Copyrighted. 
Used by permission of FREDERICK BLUME, pub-
lisher, 861 Broadway, New York. 
Words and music, 
price 35 cents. 
Last week my wife said—" Arthur dear, 
I 
should so like a 
change, 
It's rather dull for me at home, 
Now couldn't you arrange, 
To meet me after business hours, 
And then you know we might 
Just have a 
little dinner, dear, 
And go somewhere at night. 
FIRST DIALOGUE.—W hy, certainly, my popsey-wopsey, we 
will 
So, meeting with my old friend Brown, he being a 
very 
jolly fellow, advised me to take her to see Pink Dominoes, ' twill 
make you rbarl 
It did—with rage! for ever since he has done 
Rothing but sing: 
CHORUS. 
Oh Pink Dominoes, you've settled me for life, 
And why did I 
not see you first before I 
took my wife; 
She says she's found me out, and in my face she throws 
All the naughty things they do in Pink Dominoes. 
He thought he looked a 
guilty wretch, 
While everybody roared, 
lie chewed his programme into pulp, 
He felt so very bored ; 
His wife she sat like all the rest, 
Laughing at the fun, 
Says he, ' How could you bring me here, 
To show me how 'tis done?" 
19 
SECOND DI 
A 
LOGUE —SO that's 
the way you deceive your 
poor wife, is it? sending false telegrams and false letters, like 
that wicked fellow in the play ! 
And ever since he has been 
singing— 
Oh I 
Pink Dominoes, etc. 
Now should that author cross my path, 
I'll make him use his pen, 
To write a 
big apology 
To all the married men; 
And as for Brown— the horrid wretch— 
The cause of all my woes, 
will be sure to pay him out, 
And give him awful blows. 
THIRD DIALOGUE.— No, I 
won't; 
I'll buy two orchestra tick-
ets, and send them to his wife; then perhaps he will have oc-
casion to sing— 
Oh! Pink Dominoes, etc. 
HER GOLDEN FLOWING HAIR. 
SONG AND DANCE. 
Words by J. D. 
NEPPERT, Jr. 
Music by FRED. G. 
CARNES. 
Copyrighted, 18'17, by Wm. A. FREY. 
While strolling out upon the beach, 
One Summer day in May, 
I 
met a 
charming little maid, 
Who chanced to pass my way; 
Such lovely eyes bewitel.ing me, 
I 
never saw more fair, 
But what won me completely 
Was, her golden flowing hair. 
CHORCS. 
She's such a 
little beauty, 
To love her is my duty. 
Such lovely eyes bewitching me, 
You'd surely at her stare; 
And what won me completely 
Was, her golden flowing hair. 
(Dance.) 
We chatted like two friends of yore, 
And leisurely strolled along, 
I 
praised her beauty more and more, 
She said that I 
was wrong; 
And when I 
reached her home, 
Where roses scent the air, 
She seemed like an angel grand, 
With her golden flowing hair. 
She's such, etc. 
Written for JOHNNY W ILLIAMS by ED. HARRIGAN. 
From dear old Albion's shore, 
It's lately I've come o'er, 
To try to gain my fortune and a 
name; 
From old Manchester town, 
Where I've rattled up and down, 
And put the other factory boys to shame. 
With a 
pair of wooden shoes, 
Which hard knocks never bruise, 
After working hard all day I've danced away with joy, 
And the neighbors out to ride, 
Would stop at the old roadside, 
Admiring the nimble touches of this jolly factory boy. 
When I 
get through my meal, 
I'd use my toe and heel, 
Just only to settle my dinner down, 
Then away to work I'd wing 
When I'd hear the mill bell ring, 
No livelier lad for many miles around. 
One day T 
took " French leave" 
And I 
really do believe 
I 
will make my fortune here and a 
happy life enjoy; 
I 
was born to good luck, 
And I 
know that I 
have pluck, 
And I'll try to deserve it like a 
jolly factory boy. 
Sung by HARRY Woonsox with great success at the How-
ard Atheincum, Boston. 
I'se gwine back to Dixie, 
No more I'se gwine to wander, 
My heart's turned back to Dixie, 
And I 
can't stay here no longer. 
I 
miss the old plantation, 
My home and my relations, 
My heart's turned back to Dixie, 
And the Lord knows I 
must go. 
CHORUS: 
I'se gwine back to Dixie ; I'm gwine to Dixie; 
I'm going where the orange blossoms grows 
I 
hear the children calling, the leaves on the trees a 
falling, 
My heart's turned back to Dixie, and the Lord knows I 
must go. 
I'se travelling back to Dixie, 
My step is slow and feeble, 
I 
pray the Lord shall help me, 
And lead me from all evil. 
And if my strength forsakes me, 
My kind friends, come and take me; 
My heart's turned back to Dixie, 
And the Lord knows I 
must go. 
I'se gwine back, iSce:

Come, my darling, come and haste to me,

With the loved one by my side ?

What a 
glorious peal to me, 
The present hour is brimming o'er 
With joy and ecstasy.

And when the proprieter's back is turned, 
All them bums to the counter they do steer. 
CHORUS. 
Mutton pie, they all cry, 
And they chew as they never chewed before; 
Beefsteak pie, what do you soyie, 
We'll have meat on that beautiful shore. 
You can sec them every hour of the day, 
Around on the corners they do stand, 
A-waiting for some one to treat, 
0 
they will bust up any soup-house ill the land. 
CHORUS. 
Oyster pie, they all cry, 
.For a 
plate of hash all night they loudly roar; 
And when they die, bye and bye, 
We'll have beats on that beautiful shore. 
Around our large hotels they can be found, 
They all have a 
lunch route of their own, 
They're the terror of the bake shops near and far, 
And at night to some hay-loft they do roam. 
Mutton pie, etc,

Where the water lilies grow, 
And the zephyrs gently blow, 
Where the waters softly flow, 
Meet me darling Annie. 
When the whippoorwill cloth 
And the dewdrops softly fall, 
While the moon shines over all, 
Kiss me darling Annie. 
CHORUS. 
When the flowers fall asleep 
And the moon shines o'er the deep, 
Tell me I 
your heart may keep, 
Then, my darling Annie. 
Hearken to the turtle dove, 
Cooing from his nest above, 
List'ning to the tale of love, 
Whisper'd unto Annie. 
How he envies me the bliss, 
Pressing such a 
form as this, 
How he wishes he might kiss 
Your sweet lips, my Annie. 
When the flowers fall asleep, &c. 
While the little stars do shine, 
Place your snowy hand in mine, 
Whispering softly " I'll be thine," 
Now, my darling Annie. 
From the clouds the moonbeams break, 
Show'ring silver o'er the lake, 
List'ning to the vows I 
take, 
From you darling Annie. 
When the flowers fall asleep, &c. 
THE WATERMILL. 
As recited by Gus W ILLIAMS, at the Olympic Theatre. 
Ltsten to the watermill, through the livelong day, 
How the clicking of its wheel wears the hours away, 
Languidly the autumn wind stirs the greenwood leaves, 
From the fields the reapers sing, binding up the sheaves; 
And a 
proverb haunts my mind, as a 
spell is cast— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Autumn winds revive no more leaves that once are shed, 
And .he sickle cannot reap corn once gathered; 
And the rippling stream flows on, tranquil, deep and still, 
Never gliding back again to the watermill. 
Truly speaks the proverb old, with a 
meaning vast— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Take the lesson to thyself, loving heart and true, 
Golden years are fleeting by, youth is passing, too; 
Learn to make the most of life, lose no happy day, 
Time will never bring thee back chances swept away. 
Leave no tender word unsaid, love, while love shall last— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Work while yet the daylight shines, man of strength and will, 
Never does the streamlet glide useless by the mill; 
Wait not till to-morrow's sun beams upon the way, 
All that thou canst call thine own lies in thy— to- day, 
Power, intellect and health may not always last— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Oh I 
the wasted hours of life that have drifted by, 
Ohl the good we might have done, lost without a 
sigh! 
Love that we might once have saved by a 
single word, 
Thoughts conceived, but never penned, perishing unheard, 
Take the proverb to thine heart, take and hold it fast— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Oh love thy God and fellow-man, thyself consider last, 
For come it will, when thou must scan dark errors of the past ; 
And when the fight of life is o'er, and earth recedes from view, 
And Heaven in all its glory shines, 'midst the pure, the good 
the true. 
Then you'll see more clearly the proverb deep and vast— 
The mill wi'l never grind with the water that is past.

I've a 
letter that was written long ago, 
'Tis a 
letter that I've treasured many years; 
Oh, how often I 
have read those fading lines, 
And over them there's traces of my tears; 
She sent to me her blessing in that missive, 
To see me was her constant prayer; 
The little lock of gray in this old letter, 
Is a 
lock of my angel mother's hair. 
I've a 
letter that was sent me long ago, 
A 
letter that I 
keep with tender care; 
The little lock of gray in this old letter, 
Is a 
lock ot my angel mother's hair. 
I've a 
letter that was written long ago, 
That was sent to me across the stormy sea; 
When 'mong strangers I 
was wandering far away, 
And longing home again to ever be. 
But underneath the sod my mother's sleeping, 
She's free from earthly trials and its care; 
But ever next my heart I'll keep herletter 
And the lock of my angel mother's hair. 
I've a 
letter, etc.

THE GOOSE WITH THE GOLDEN EGG, 
A true illustration of life, written expressly for FRANK LENVI 
by BOBBY NEWCOMB, America's Character Artist. 
When I 
was of age my father he left 
To me quite a 
snug little stun ; 
He says—" Now, my boy, good sense please employ, 
And remember you've reached twenty-one." 
My friends when they heard of what had occurred, 
How they hastened to borrow or beg; 
For I 
flew a 
high kite, and they said, when in sight— 
" 
He's the goose with the golden egg." 
To my utmost surprise I 
attracted all eyes, 
And people inquired my name, 
Who a 
few months before, pronounced me a 
bore, 
And of my dress and my features made game. 
They'd laugh when I'd joke, with me dine, drink or smoke, 
To ray face they were dumb as a 
keg; 
But when I'd turn my back, how they'd laugh and they'd 
clack, 
At the goose with the golden egg. 
Theyirls all so fair, admired my hair, 
Pt—was auburn—before it was red; 
They spoke of ray style, drooped their eyes when I'd smile, 
And mamas marked me fit to be wed. 
Their daughters they sighed, and some their hair dyed, 
I 
was loved by Jane, Martha and Meg; 
My presents they took, and they all tried to hook— 
The poor goose with the golden egg. 
But a 
day came at last, I'd been living too fast, 
Run in debt and my money all flown; 
Where'er I 
would call, they'd let me wait in the hall, 
And the message I'd get—" Not at home." 
They'd giggle and jeer, where'er I 
appeared, 
Pass me by with a 
nod or a 
sneer; 
For the goose it was dead, and the egg turned to lead, 
I 
had bought my experience dear. 
Now ray subject of rhyme may just be in time. 
For the world I 
don't care a 
peg ; 
But what I 
would say—I 
was once in my day, 
A poor goose with a 
golden egg.

LACKAWANNA GANG. 
As sung by KONOLLMAN and RiTrIE with great success. 
Also 
sung by CONROY and MURPHY nightly. 
Here we are, two " Laekawanna Spooners ;" 
While we're here keep your eyes upon us; 
We load coal from Harlam to Gowanus, 
We're the two selected " Spooners of the Gang." 
When we go home our family we embrace; 
We eat our meals with elegance and grace; 
For opposition shovellers we long to have a 
race; 
We're the two selected " Spooners of the Gang," 
CHORUS. 
As through the streets we walk along like soldiers, 
And baskets and shovels we have upon our shoulders; 
For to get a 
job there's none can be bolder, 
Than the two selected " Spooners of the Gang." 
(Chorus repeated.) 
On Saturday nights we stand upon the corners, 
Along with the gang that wears the Roll of Honor 
At Hibernian Hall we're going to raise a 
banner, 
To represent the " Lackawanna Gang." 
We all get shaved in the one barber shop, 
We use the same razor, lather brush, and cup, 
For Bay Rum and Tonic we long to have a 
sup, 
To stimulate the " Lackawanna Gang." 
As through, etc. 
We've accumulated wealth with hard work and endurance; 
With other scallawags we have no interference; 
We have been hard tried by work and perseverance, 
The two selected " Spooners of the Gang." 
With the " General Committee" we are two great big cards, 
Like " Muldoon, the Solid Man," we hold a 
grip in the ward, 
We could put you on the Pipes or the City Boulevard, 
The two selected " Spooners of the Gang."

To tell you all aboud her, I

In your path through life each day, you will meet upon the 
way, 
Fellow mortals upon whom this world cloth frown, 
Who, from poverty or crime, have fallen in their time, 
Or by circumstances crushed and striken down; 
Young men with blighted names, who once had noble aims. 
Young girls with shame and sorrow on their brow, 
Whom a 
kindly word might save, from a dark, dishonored 
grave, 
While a 
cruel one would drive to madness now. 
They were once to some one dear, so don't pass them with a 
Sneer, 
But speak a 
kindly word in cheering tone; 
You know not what's in store, for the loved ones you adore, 
Remember you have children of your own, 
The shop girls on the street, with as much respect should meet, 
As the millionaire who in his carriage rolls, 
And the honest laboring man, with his strong and horny hand, 
They too have hearts and feelings—yes, and souls; 
Their fixidly is as dear to them as any here, 
Though their clothes may be all ragged, torn and old, 
Dejected and forlorn, yet, still their hearts are warm, 
Though they lack the rich man's cheerful home and gold. 
They are all to some one dear, so don't pass them with a 
jeer, 
But speak a 
gentle word in soothing tone; 
You know not what's in store, for those whom you adore, 
Remember you have children of your own. 
Don't despise the wretched poor, whom perhaps grim want 
may lure, 
To steal the bread their starving children crave, 
Be not the one to blame, you yourself would do the same, 
With starvation at your door you'd dare the grave; 
And the wretched drunkard, too, who perhaps was once like 
you, 
Respected and beloved by one and all, 
Who no doubt through care and strife, or some sorrow of thei - 
life, 
Have fallen, but not quite beyond recall. 
And the poor outcast forlorn, don't pass them by with scorn, 
But speak unto them in a 
gentle tone; 
Perhaps they're not to blame for their lives of sin and shame, 
Remember you have children of your own.

Don't talk of new sensations, 
For I'm sure I 
take the lead, 
And ere I'm done most everyone, 
Will say I'm right indeed;

And your sorrows I'll beguile, 
I'll try my best to please you with 
My own fantastic style.

To all this happy throng; 
I 
am different from every one, 
So just listen for awhile, 
And I'll show you something neater, 
In my own peculiar style. 
Watch the motion, etc. 
I 
do not sing of beauties, 
But I'll leave it all to you, 
Is there anything as graceful 
As the motion of my shoe? 
You can search the world all over, 
You can travel mile and mile, 
And you'll find I've not an equal 
In my own peculiar style.

THE HERALD COMPLAINT BOOK. 
A new idea for a 
song, taken from the column in the 
Herald, called the "Complaint Book," written by TONY 
PASTOR, and sung by FRANK LEWIS. 
The hit 
of the season at the Academy 
of 
Music, Phtsburg. 
Of course in search of novelties are people now-a- days, 
New subjects they are sure to find in novels, songs and plays: 
But if in search of something new, you only have to look 
And read the various grumbles in the Herald " Complaint 
Book." 
6POKEN.—This is from a 
gentleman who takes his meals out— 
Mr. Editor, in the restaurant where I 
make my daily calls, 
I 
fonnd an India rubber shoe in one of my codfish balls; 
Now, will I 
sue the proprietor, or will I 
punch the cook ? 
Or will I 
show the rascal up in the Herald " ComplaiOnt Book ?" 
SPOKEN.—In regards to the stage— 
There's a 
question I 
would like to ask, aud an answer I 
expect, 
Why Mabel Leonard from the stage they forcibly eject? 
While the ragged urchins on the street they quietly overlook, 
Our Commissioners should look after them. 
Put that down on 
the book. 
SPOKEN.—From a 
respectable married lady— 
I've been married now five years or more, and have neither 
kith nor kin, 
And in the shape of a 
family there's nothing yet been seen; 
While Mrs. Jones, across the way, on a 
pair of twins can look, 
Won't some one stir my husband up in the Herald " Complaint 
Book ?"

I 
took my girl one day, 
A 
sailing down the bay, 
And Emma was the darling creature's name; 
While standing on the pier, 
Some chaps at her did stare, 
And one and all around her did exclaim: 
Cnortus. 
Ohl Emma, whoa! Emma, 
Kmma, you put me in quite a 
dilemma; 
Oh! Emma, whoa I 
Emma, 
That's what I 
hear wherever I 
go. 
I 
asked them what they meant, 
When some one at me sent 
An egg, which nearly struck me in the eye 
Emma began to scream, 
"Oh! Fred, what does this mean?" 
I 
asked again, and this was their reply: 
! 
Emma, etc. 
I 
thought they'd never cease, 
So shouted out " Police !" 
And when he came he looked at me so sly; 
The crowd then at me laughed, 
And said I 
must be " daft," 
And once again they all commenced to cry: 
Oh! Emma, eto 
An old man said to me, 
" 
Why, young man can't you see 
The joke!" and I 
look'd at him with surprise I 
He said " don't be put out,"

saying's got about;

HER FRONT NAME IS KANNER. 
As sung by LARRY TOOLEY. 
The heart in my bosom has lately been stole, 
By a 
sweet blushing maiden, just nineteen years old •, 
She's half Irish, blonde, and likes pork and beans, 
Her feet are a 
feature— she wears seventeens. 
CHORUS. 
Her front name is Harmer, 
Her father's a 
tanner, 
Him she does hammer, 
In an artistic manner; 
She sings " Star-Spangled Banner," 
And " A Lean Banana," 
With a 
tooth-brush I 
fan her, 
When she thumps the pianner. 
She wears a 
Moire Antique pull- back, cost six cents a 
yard, 
Her hat and parasol are made out of lard; 
She shall be 
lady, like Judy O'Grady, 
For I've wealt:i (to get) and will keep it shady. 
Her front name, etc. 
Her mouth—well, it stretches from ear to ear, 
Whenever it's open I'm afraid to go near; 
Whenever she talks I'm never around, 
For I'm sure J'd fall in, and I 
know I'd get drowned. 
Her front name, etc.

There's one sweet face in all this world, 
Whose smile to me is bliss, 
One pretty pair of pouting lips 
That I 
would love to kiss; 
And this fairy little queen is only seventeen, 
Her voice is sweetest music as it floats upon the air; 
Her style is very neat, and she has such tiny feet, 
And on her dainty finger is a 
sparkling solitaire. 
CHORUS 
She's deep blue eyes and golden hair, 
With dimpled cheeks and face so fair; 
She's a 
queen among the bon- tons, 
Is this lovely millionaire; 
Upon her dainty finger 
Is a 
sparkling solitaire. 
One moonlight night I 
whispered love 
Into her willing ear, 
She blushed and nestled to my side, 
And brushed away a 
tear; 
While my brain was in a 
whirl, I 
kissed this darling girl, 
We sat for hours so happy, and she said my lot she'd share 
And then we did agree that next week we'd married be, 
And on her dainty finger is a 
sparkling solitaire. 
She's deep blue eyes, cte.

And their fluent conversation; 
There's none with me, boys, can compare, 
I 
am the greatest in the natior. 
I 
am known by all, both great and small, 
An Irishman from Donegal. 
And the ladies all say, both one and all, 
I 
am a 
man of education. 
I 
am an Irishman, both heart and hand, 
I 
have just come over to this free land, 
And I

man of education. 
I 
am never taken for Charley Ross, 
I'm a 
man of solid foundation; 
I 
will tell you, boys, that I'm the boss, 
And I 
am proud of my high station. 
Of the war in Europe I 
know all about, 
A 
brass band rollows me when I

The boys all lift their hats and shout, 
For the man with education. 
I 
am an Irishman, etc

Words by GEORGE COOPER. 
As sung by Alrr..Es Monras, at the Theatre Comique, N. Y. 
I 
dream of the now, in thy beauty and pride, 
Sweet home that I 
left long ago! 
And friends of' my youth roam again by my side, 
In twilight's enchantment and glow. 
In visions, I 
see lovely faces of old, 
And smiles like the blossoms of May 
Oh ! blessings forever thy valleys unfold, 
Thou dear little Isle far away ! 
CHORUS 
The sweetest of homes, and the joy of my heart, 
Still fonder to me, day by day; 
Bright menfries of thee never more shall depart, 
Thou dear little Isle far away ! 
I 
roam on thy shore, in my childhood again, 
And list to the waves while they sing ; 
Thy visions of old are unclouded by pain, 
And sweetest of pleasures they bring. 
The voices I 
loved wake my heart to delight, 
While back to thy valleys I 
stray; 
And fancy can picture no lovelier sight, 
Than thee, little Isle far away! 
CHORD'S. 
The sweetest of homes, and the joy ef my heart, 
Still fonder to me, day by day, 
Bright mem'ries of thee never more shall depart, 
Thou dear litle Isle far away! 
OUR BONNY IRISH LASSES. 
l3y Envrattp HARRIGAN'. 
Sung in his new play, " My Wife's 
Mother." 
Copyright, i.&1'1, by A. J. Ftsiittt, 98 Nassau St., New York. 
Let every man from Paddy's Land, 
Sweet Cork, or Londonderry, 
Castlebar, or fair Armagh, 
Join hands and let us be merry. 
Far down or Tip. 
When potteen you sip, 
Plaze overflow your glasses, 
Let this be your toast, 
Old Ireland's beast, 
Our Bonnie Irish Lasses. 
CHORUS. 
The rosy cheek, 
The coal black eye, 
No girl on earth surpasses, 
The sweet colleen, 
From Erin green, 
Our bonnie Irish lasses. 
France and Italy, Scotland, too, 
Are famed for beauty rare; 
From Russia's snow, to Mexico, 
All have an equal share. 
Geographically, 
In history, 
Ancient or modern classes, 
Beauty's crown 
Was handed down 
For our bonnie Irish lasses. 
Soft and silky is their hair, 
Good natured as a 
dove, 
Ever true, the colleen rhu, 
'Twas she invented love. 
There's a 
story old, 
Of Adam bold, 
While dozing on the grasses, 
Good luck, says he, 
Whereer you be, 
You bonny Irish lasses. 
The rosy cheek, etc.

Words by EDWARD HARRIGAN. 
Music by G. W. H. GRIFFIN. 
Sung in EDWARD HARRIGAN'S great play of " Old Lavender." 
Oh many moons have passed and gone, 
Since first I 
went to school, 
At Harvard, dear old Harvard, friends, 
I 
learned the Golden Rule; 
My classmates scattered here and there, 
All trod their different ways, 
I 
love to think and ponder o'er 
My youthful college days. 
(Repeal last two lines.) 
I 
remember when a 
Freshman there, 
My age just twenty-four, 
In the Yale and Harvard race, my friends, 
I 
always rowed stroke oar;, 
Our colors—handsome scarlet bright— 
First led the van always, 
Admired by the ladies all, 
Was I 
in college days. 
(Repeat last two lines.) 
Oh, the day when I 
did graduate, 
I 
was my parents pride, 
Fitted for the bar or bench, 
A 
linguist, too, beside; 
Socially I'd always meet 
My colleagues bright and gay, 
And toss a 
merry social glass, 
To our commencement day. 
(Repeat last two lines.) 
Culture and intelligence, 
Are qualities quite fine, 
They help constitute the gentleman, 
In every worldly clime; 
You may crush them down unto the ground, 
With poverty's cold ways, 
They'll rise again, assert their claims, 
As taught in college days. 
(Repeat last two lines.) 
MANY CAN HELP ONE. 
Sung nightly by W ILL. H. MORTON, with HARRIGAN (
k., HART'S' 
Combination. 
Some very good sayings I've heard in my time, 
And some I 
believe to be true; 
The subject I'll mention to- night in my song 
Is one that is well known to you. 
Should you meet a 
man that is down in the world, 
And assistance you can't give him any, 
Remember that many can always help one, 
While one cannot always help many. 
A man may be wealthy one end of the year, 
The next one be wretched and poor, 
He struggles his hardest to keep himself up, 
But has sunk down to poverty's door. 
To styli worthy men, ' tis a 
terrible blow, 
So give it to those most in need, 
For you who've experienced poverty know 
'Tis a 
very hard battle indeed. 
I 
hope what I've mentioned to-night in my song, 
That nothing I've said out of place ; 
A man though he's poor may still honest be, 
For poverty is no disgrace. 
So give what you can with a 
generous heart, 
We don't know how scon things may turn ; 
Give him a 
chance to rise up in the world, 
And your kindness he'll surely return. 
Written by EDWARD HARRIGAN, and sung by him in his beauti-
ful sketch of " The Blue and the Gray." 
On the banks of the Potomac, 
I 
am lonely here to-night, 
Sure I'm waiting for the enemy 
To come out here and fight; 
Arrah, when this war is over, . 
Oh, I 
will bless the day, 
Let me be dead or living, 
I'd praise America. 
But sure I 
can't help thinking 
Of the girl I 
left behind, 
A 
rosy Irish lassie, 
So loving and so kind; 
My dear old grey-haired mother, 
I 
left there all alone, 
I'd feel like young Napoleon, 
When I 
go marching home. 
Oh, a 
soldier's life is tedious, 
When he's laying loose in camp, 
We never have excitement 
Unless we're on a 
tramp; 
A 
short life and a 
merry one, 
Is generally our lot, 
Till we get our life-long furlough, 
From the enemy's heavy shot. 
If a 
soldier's never kilt, 
Oh, he's smothered up in luck, 
Should he lose an ear or finger, 
Or be wid a 
bagnet struck; 
He can get a 
pair of crutches, 
From the doctor, it's well known, 
And feel like the King of Persia, 
When he goes marching home. 
It's a 
pleasure to the soldier, 
To look up in the skies, 
And see the stars a-blinking, 
Like a 
pair of roguish eyes; 
A-winking and a-twinkling, 
Jnst as if they'd say 
You may kiss me if you catch me, 
Before I 
get away. 
For to hear th2 wind a-howling 
And moaning through the trees, 
It's enough to make you shiver, 
And tremble in the knees; 
But I 
must do my duty, 
If I 
petrify to stone, 
I'll feel like Julius Cmsar, 
When I 
go marching home. 
(Original Song.) 
Words by .Tom: PEASLEY. 
Sung with great success by the 
PEASLETS, 
I'll tell you of a 
jolly time 
We had while at O'Reilly's raffle, 
Some were dancing, some were singing, 
Others making lots of fun. 
Some were dancing with their partners, 
Others kissing in the corners, 
Music playing, whiskey flying, 
At O'Reilly's raffle. 
We were called up to the bar, 
We took a 
drink with Paddy O'Mar, 
Mickey Flynn, who had the most, 
He got up and gave a 
toast. 
Clionrs. 
Here's good luck to all the party— 
James Muldoon and Biddy McCarty, 
Michael Dolan, Teddy Regan, 
Danced the dust out of the floor. 
Here's to all the pretty ladies— 
Katy Mack, the two O'Bradys, 
We won't forget the time we had 
While at O'Reilly's raffle. 
We played all games and danced all dances, 
From the break-down to the lancers, 
Cracking jokes and telling stories, 
The girls all were in their glory. 
Some were eating, some were thinking, 
Some were sleeping, some were drinking, 
Others shaking for the turkeys, 
At O'Reilly's raffle. 
Then the ruction soon began, 
'Twas woman to woman, and man to man. 
Broken chairs began to fly, 
One struck me right over my eye, 
CHORUS. 
Music playing, whiskey flying, 
Some were laughing, some were crying, 
Others taking off their coats, 
And getting ready for a 
fight. 
The girls they began a-squealing, 
The big blagnards they had no feeling, 
At it right and left they went, 
And busted O'Reilly's raffle. 
BERUD TEE SCENES, • 
As sung by W ILL. Moirrox. 
When but a 
little boy, oh, it really was my joy 
To visit the theatre, I'll admit, 
And how happy I 
would be, the performances to see 
While seated in the gallery or pit. 
I 
fancied all was real, that the curtain did reveal, 
But since that I 
have passed beyond my teens ; 
I 
begin to understand, though in front it may look grand 
It's very different just behind the scenes. 
So if if you will attend for a 
moment, now my friends, 
I'll do the best within my humble means, 
To show to you to-night, though in front it may look bright, 
It's very different just behind the scenes. 
The comedian is one, who, while causing lots of fun, 
His heart may yet hang heavy in his breast ; 
And he who plays the king, though it seems a 
curious thing, 
In private may be very poorly dressed. 
Then the ballet girl so fair, who goes floating through the air, 
And looks like little angels there instead ; 
Sometimes they have to roam, into a 
wretched home, 
And oftentimes go supperless to bed. 
And those who play the parts, of the men with stony hearts, 
And look as if their tempers were like fiends; 
Could you see them while away, you certainly would say 
They're the mildest looking men behind the scenes. 
Now there's many a 
married pair, I've no doubt you are aware, 
Who in public are so tender and so kind; 
But could you only see them at home in privacy, 
A 
very difterent state of things you'd find. 
Sometimes it is the wife who causes all the strife, 
Sometimes it is the husband who's to blame; 
But be that as it may, who causc:.; all the fray, 
Their guar.:041g cont:nues jmkt the same. 
And oft they try to hide froni all the worid outside, 
The snarls and jars with which their household teems , 
And often wliun you hear them call each other dear, 
They hate each other just behind the scenes. 
Now its just the samo in life, though what lots of care and 
strife. 
And suffering some folks will undergo 
Just to cut a 
shine, and to make time ' ,selves look fine, 
They think of nothing else but outside show. 
Some fancy and suppose, that those who wear good clothes, 
Always are they richest and the best ; 
But an honest heart and mind, is respected most you'll find, 
No matter whether rich or poorly dressed. 
Then no matter where we go, from the highest to the low, 
From peasantry ' way up to kings or queens, 
Whatever we enjoy, there's something to annoy, 
If we ould only peep behind the scenes. 
Sung by the new "BIG FOUR." 
White folks give me your attention, 
While I 
sing to you my song, 
It's about a 
gal I'm gwine to mention, 
And I 
promise not to detain you long. 
I've been courting her for many a 
day, 
And to her house I 
often come around, 
In her stocking feet she stands five foot, 
And weighs 150 pounds. 
Come all you Digs and join together, 
Hand the banjo down and we'll have a 
dance, 
I'm gwine to be married next Sunday eve, 
To my great big tall and greasy Sue. 
I 
have got my ma's consent, 
My father feels quite satisfied, 
.Next Sunday eve I'll take his arm, 
And to the church we all shall glide. 
And then when we are both united, 
We'll own a 
house and coach and four, 
And won't it be gay to see every day, 
Our little Lappells playing on the floor. 
Come all you figs, &c. 
Oh, Sue, I'm glad you got consent 
And what a 
happy pair we'll make, 
What funny names to be called out of church, 
George Lappell and Susan Flake. 
Then you'll be my wife forever, 
And lots of things for you I'll buy; 
I'll never go back on George Lapp°ll, 
Until the very day I 
die. 
Come all you nigs, SLe. 
MY MOTHER-IN-LAW 
Written and sung by BEN DODGE. 
I 
daily am growing depressed and disheartened, 
My griefs and my troubles to you I'll relate; 
Dame Fortune upon me is certainly frowning, 
The cause of my sadness is my cruel fate. 
The whole of my life is o'ercast with a 
shadow, 
For all kinds of pleasure I 
don't care a 
straw; 
It's simply because, like a 
fool, I 
got married, 
And I've got a 
bad case of a " mother-in-law." 
She comes twice every year to pay us a 
visit, 
And not stretching the truth the least mite, I 
can swear 
That each visit is fully of six months duration, 
And her presence completely fills me with despair. 
When she enters the house then my trouble commences, 
For the whole livelong day she does nothing but jaw; 
How often I've envied oar first father—Adam— 
For he wasn't cursed with a 
mother-in-law. 
Our servant girl, Sarah, is fresh from the country, 
An exceedingly good-natured and pretty young miss, 
One evening, while hugging her down in the kitchen, 
I 
thought I'd endeavor to steal a 
sly kiss. 
Said Sarsh, " Your wife would most surely be jealous, 
If she could but see us;" I 
answered, " Oh, shawl" 
When the door was burst open, and there stood before us 
that horrid old monster, my mother-in-law. 
The girl was discharged then and T 
soundly rated, 
For I 
couldn't lie out of the matter, of course, 
And my mother-in-law's tongue is constantly running, 
So my wife firmly vows se will have a 
divorce. 
Now our " Crack Rifle Team" does some mighty fine shooting, 
The result of each match is always a 
draw; 
I'll give any good marksman seven dollars and a 
half 
To take a 
few shots at my mother-in-law. 
Composed by HARRY BENNETT, and sung with success by BILLY 
CARTER. 
Oh, love is such a 
very funny thing, 
And it catches the young and the old, 
It's just like a 
plate of boarding-house hash, 
And many a 
man it has sold. 
It makes you feel like a 
fresh water eel, 
And causes your head to swell. 
You lose your mind, for love is blind, 
And it empties your pocket- book as well. 
Cnonus. 
Boys keep away from the gals, I 
say, 
Give them lots of room, 
Or you'll find when you're wed, 
They will bang you till you're dead, 
With bald-headed end of a 
broom. 
When man is gone on a 
pretty little gal, 
lie talks just as gentle as a 
dove; 
He spends all his money, and calls her his honey, 
For to show her he is solid on his love. 
When his money is gone and his clothes in hock, 
He finds the old saying it is true, 
That a 
mole on the arm is worth two on the leg, 
But what is he going for to do. 
Boys keep away, etc, 
When married folks have lots of cash, 
Their love is firm and strong, 
But when they have to feed on hash 
Their love don't last so long. 
With a 
wife and seventeen half-starved kids, 
tell you its no fun. 
When your butcher comes around to collect his bill, 
With a 
dog and double barrel gun. 
Boys keep away, etc. 
Young fellows just take my advice, 
Don't be in a 
hurry for to wed, 
You think you're in clover till the honey-moon's over, 
And then you'll think you're dead. 
With a 
cross-eyed baby on each knee, 
And a 
wife with a 
plaster on her nose, 
You'll find true love don't run so very smooth, 
When you have to wear your second-hand clothes 
Boys keep away, etc. 
When the rent is high, and the kids all cry 
Because there's no grub to chaw, 
You'll holler for your son 
To load up your gun, 
While you vaccinate mother-in-law.

DANCING IN THE SUNLIGHT. 
Written and composed by JAMES MAAS for the GIRARD BROTH-
ERS, and sun: by them with immense success, at the 
Howard Athenmum, Boston. 
What a 
pleasure there is in dancing the sunlight, 
When all earth seems to smile; 
It makes a 
merry ringing in your laughter, 
You have no care or guile. 
With ringing notes from pearly throats, 
We while the hours away; 
With beaming smile our time beguile, 
We are always blythe and gay. 
Oh, what a 
pleasure there is dancing in the sunlight, 
When all earth seems to smile; 
It makes a 
merry ringing in your laughter, 
You have no care or guile. 
CHORUS. 
Hark, hark I

Shout, shout I

What a 
pleasure there is dancing in the sunlight, 
When all earth seems to smile; 
It makes a 
merry ringing in your laughter, 
You have no care or guile. 
What a 
pleasure there is dancing in the sunlight, 
For it will make you glad; 
In the golden rays its shadow it will mock you, 
And whirl and dance like mad. 
When sunset's come, and day is done, 
And darkness claims her right, 
We'll go to rest, and the blest, 
The rays of morning light. 
Oh I 
What a 
pleasure there is dancing in the sunlight, 
When all earth seems to smile; 
It makes a 
merry ringing in your laughter, 
You have no care or guile.

These Cards are arranged and printed in series—Hearts, Clubs, Dia-
anonds and Spades—and each or these into K for King. Q for Queen, 
and K 
for Knave, and numbers 1, 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
four rows, and are to be read according to directions. Many of the an-
swers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under-
standing. Many professional Fortune- Tellers use these cards, and we 
are in receipt of letters in relation to them from all parts of the U: Et.

Courting Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too dial. 
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unlady-like encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many 
lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. This pack of Cards will overcome the difa-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players. 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties
