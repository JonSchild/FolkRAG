Utah Section"' 
FINAL REPORT 
"ITALIAN-AMERICANS IN THE WEST": UTAH SECTION 
AMERICAN FOLKLIFE CENTER/LIBRARY OF CONGRESS 
Submitted by Steve Siporin (Utah State University) 
Fieldwork for the Carbon County, Utah, section of the 
"Italian-Americans in the West" project took place during the 
summer and early fall of 1990. 
Fieldworkers Tom Carter, Phil 
Notarianni, and Steve Siporin generated 56 rolls of color slides, 
37 rolls of black and white photographs, thirty cassette tapes, 
and eleven reels of oral interviews. 
Carter was assisted by two 
graduate students from the School of Architecture at the 
University of Utah, Margaret (Bee) Bergold and Susan Anderson. 
Carter and his assistants furnished floorplans and perspective 
drawings of several key buildings, gardens, and an outdoor bake 
oven. 
Notarianni and Siporin also supplied three reels of video 
footage, two contemporary and one historic. 
Each fieldworker 
wrote copious field notes, and other miscellaneous documents were 
also submitted. 
Geology and landscape  
When one crosses Soldier Summit on US 6 and begins to 
descend this highway linking Carbon County with the Salt Lake 
Valley, where the vast majority of Utahans live, one major 
geological region has been left behind for another. 
Driving to 
Helper and Price from Salt Lake City, one leaves the Rocky 
Mountain physiographic province and enters the Colorado Plateau: 
A major portion of the state, in the southeast, falls within 
the Colorado Plateau Province, which is divided into three 
primary sections: the Uinta Basin, Canyonlands, and High 
Plateaus.l 
All three of the primary sections of the Colorado Plateau 
intersect in Carbon County. 
Here, in East Central Utah, geology 
turns one away from the Great Basin and the Northwest, orienting 
one eastward, to Colorado, and southward, to the Southwest. 
Although Salt Lake City is the nearest metropolitan area and 
communication is well developed in the Salt Lake City direction, 
ancient geology draws inhabitants in the opposite direction. 
The 
cultural differences between Carbon County and metropolitan, LDS 
Salt Lake City confirm the geological rift.2 
People  
Carbon County's population is exceptional in Utah. 
As one 
native proudly put it, "Carbon County is an island in the 
mainstream of Utah history. 
Fortunately, Utah is rapidly

LDS, but no other single factor defines its character as its 
Mormon heritage.

catching up with us."3 
The difference is most obvious in politics. 
According to 
the atlas of Utah, Carbon County is the only Utah county to be 
considered "solid Democratic" (p. 171). 
It was the only county 
to vote for Kennedy by more than a sixty per cent margin in 1960 
and to give Nixon less than sixty per cent of the vote (barely 
fifty per cent) against McGovern in 1972. 
Only one other Utah 
county voted for Carter in 1976 and not with the percentage 
Carbon County provided (pp. 171-172). 
This striking political 
contrast is merely the surface manifestation of a much deeper 
gulf. 
I almost suspect that if Utah were a Democratic state, 
Carbon County would have to be Republican. 
Carbon County was created out of predominantly Mormon Emery 
County in 1894 by the Utah Territorial Legislature 
...as an outgrowth of the fears of the predominantly LDS 
people of Emery County that their political machinery would 
be overwhelmed by a population of southern Europeans whom 
they thought of as ill-educated, uncultured, and Catholic. 
The Mormon population in Utah looked upon Carbon County as 
strange and alien. 
However incorrect the Mormons` 
preconceptions were about the nature of these people, the 
fear that they would lose political control was a realistic

City: Utah State Historical Society, 1981), p. 40.

one.4 
Even though large-scale immigration ended in the early 1920s 
and Carbon County's population continued to grow until the 1950s, 
there were fewer residents in 1990 than in 1950. 
The majority of 
Carbon County residents today are not Mormon, and ethnic 
diversity still remains a hallmark. 
Today's new immigrants are 
mainly Hispanic. 
Unlike much of Utah outside the Ogden/Salt Lake City/Provo 
corridor (which runs north/south along the Wasatch Front), 
agriculture is not one of Carbon County's main industries--
"agriculture has always been marginal" here, and coal mining and 
railroading are the controlling economic factors.5 
Residents of 
Carbon County have long lived with a boom-and-bust economy, which 
fluctuates with the demand for coal. 
As mentioned above, the 
population grew until the 1950s when it began a decline that only 
slowed with the energy crisis (and increased demand for coal) of 
the 1970s. 
But even by 1990, the population had not reached the 
level of 1950. 
(In fact, in the 1980s it slipped an additional 
8.8 per cent, from 22,179 to 20,228.) 
Today's mining technology 
has reduced the need for coal miners, even in the best of times, 
so that Carbon County seems to be facing a depressed economy 
unless, or until, its economic base can be changed.

Carbon County Coal Industry," in Notarianni, p.

Nevertheless, the human warmth, generosity, and genuine charm of 
the ethnic descendants of immigrant parents and grandparents make 
this bleak geologic and economic landscape an unsurpassed 
environment for folklore fieldwork. 
The Italian ethnic population exists within a context of 
ethnic diversity (an "outpost of ethnicity," as Hal Cannon calls 
it), and Italians are not necessarily the most "successful" of 
local groups in maintaining their group traditions, according to 
local opinion. 
A number of Italian informants pointed to the 
Greeks (with some jealousy) as the model ethnic group of Carbon 
County, noting that the Greeks have a separate church (with its 
own Greek priest), that they maintain their own language even 
among young people, and that there is a Greek restaurant and a 
Greek festival.6 
(The best-known and respected historian of 
ethnicity in Utah, Helen Z. Papanikolas, is a Greek-American 
native of Helper.) 
The unity of religion, language, and culture may appear 
stronger to outsiders than to insiders from the Greek community, 
who are familiar with their own internal rifts, but it is true 
that since Italians have to share their Catholic religion and its 
institutions with other Catholic ethnic immigrants like 
Slovenians and Croatians (and Mexicans and Mexican-Americans, 
today), and since their language is not canonized in a liturgy as 
is Greek (or Hebrew elsewhere), Italians have some different 
6 Greek language is taught through the Church. 
5 
problems With cultural continuity.7 
One Italian informant, Al 
Veltri, married a Greek woman. 
Although a rule cannot be deduced 
from a single example, it is significant that his son does not 
speak Italian but does speak Greek, a far harder language for 
English-speakers to learn. 
The name of the Catholic Church in Price, Notre Dame De 
Lourdes, indicates the homage paid to the French Basque family 
which was the church's benefactor. 
(The Nick family's name 
appears in one of the stained-glass windows of the church.) 
In 
Helper there is also the more modest and more Italian, St. 
Anthony's. 
For the Greeks, the church was an institution that 
reinforced ethnicity; for the Italians the church had to find 
commonalities between different ethnic groups and thus worked in 
somewhat the opposite direction. 
Today, Italian religious folk 
custom, to the extent that it is present, exists mainly within 
the home, and Italian language has not been maintained. 
There is 
no longer a noteworthy Italian restaurant in either Price or 
Helper--although two key informants, Josephine (Nick) Copfer and 
Palmina (Nick) New, have run a steakhouse in Price (called the 
Matador) for many years. 
Italian food used to be featured once a 
week. 
Thus one gets a certain sense of the retreat of Italian 
culture in Carbon County, and our fieldwork tended to focus more

felt Old World regional rivalries within their groups--Calabrese 
vs. Piemontese for the Italians, Cretans vs. mainlanders for the 
Greeks.

on historical rather than contemporary expressions of ethnicity. 
It is not that Italian ethnicity is entirely gone--regional 
Italian folklife has been adapted, and, even more significantly, 
has constituted a valuable tool of adaptation. 
But it would be 
an illusion and wishful thinking to claim that Italian ethnicity 
in Carbon County today is a dynamic, central force. 
That, of 
course, could change. 
Carbon County provides a clearly demarcated environment in 
which to observe the processes of culture change among immigrants 
and their descendants over the course of the last ninety years. 
Our fieldwork sought continuities with the Old World and creative 
adaptations to the New. 
As I review the material we generated, 
it seems to me that there are at least the following major areas 
of interest: 
-Architecture and stone masonry 
-Gardens 
-Foodways 
-Narratives of immigration, survival, and work 
-Gravemarkers 
-Matriarchal families 
Architecture and stone masonry  
Although all three of us had conducted previous research in 
the area, I personally had never realized the extent to which 
Helper, much smaller than Price, was the soul of Carbon County: 
7 
it is the still the rail center, it was a multi-ethnic mining 
town, and it remains the core of "Italian-ness." 
Helper's old 
commercial core is a National Register Historic District. 
But Spring Glen, located between Helper and Price, offers 
another area rich in Italian experience; it is the "truck-
farming" and dairy area: 
Today it is a town unique in Utah: 
a settled farming 
village with a Mormon-Italian-Yugoslav population. 
Utah 
contains many agrarian hamlets; they are heavily Latter-day 
Saint. 
Ethnically mixed communities also abound; they are 
commercial or industrial. 
Spring Glen is the exception.8 
Diffused along several roads, Spring Glen is the location of the 
Manina House (see Carter's drawings), the Saccomano Farm (see 
Siporin interview and slides) and the Bonacci home (see 
Notarianni and Siporin interviews, slides, and fieldnotes). 
The 
distance between Price and Helper is only about seven miles, and 
Spring Glen lies in between. 
Here I would like to quote from my fieldnotes and the draft 
of my essay, "Folklore and Survival: the Italian-Americans of 
Carbon County, Utah` 
Italians in Helper created not only their own economy 
8 Nancy Jacobus Taniguchi, "Rebels and Relatives: The Mormon 
Foundation of Spring Glen, 1878-90," in Utah Historical Quarterly 
48 (1990): 367.

and entertainment.; they created their own landscape as well. 
Parts of this landscape, like the outdoor babe ovens which 
were once a regular feature in so many yards, are mostly 
gone today, but driving or walking around Helper, one begins 
to realize that there is a particular balance to the yards 
that is quite different from other American towns and 
neighborhoods. 
Outbuildings like small shacks and converted 
garages (usually with smoke stacks) are bunched at the back 
or side of the yard, often adjacent to a fence. 
Some yards 
have two or three such sheds--and few have none. 
These were 
once used for making and storing sausage, prosciutto, 
capacolla, soprasatta, and wine, for baking bread, for 
drying oregano and garlic. 
(In contrast, only twenty-five 
miles away is the mining town of Scofield, Utah, which was 
home to many Finnish immigrants. 
Scofield lacks stonework, 
and the outbuildings are saunas rather than sausage-making 
sheds.) 
These outbuildings make Helper unique; they create 
a dense, intricate network, an industrial, urban village 
texture in the midst of a landscape dominated by rock-rimmed 
canyons, mountains, and the sky. 
The contributions of Italian folklife reached beyond 
the Italian immigrant community. 
Common skills the 
immigrants brought with them, stonemasonry in particular, 
were used to lay the foundations of towns and industry, to 
transform "that awesome space" of the West into a human 
9 
place.9 
But one locally-told anecdote about a Calabrian 
stone mason who built a jail suggests that Italians were 
punished rather than rewarded for their stoneworking skills: 
According to family tradition, after Felice 
Gigliotti completed the jail [in 190)4] and was paid by 
the United States Fuel Company, he entered the saloon 
in Hiawatha and offered to buy drinks for everyone. 
Two "Americans" announced that they would not drink 
with a "God-damn Italian." 
The highly insulted 
Gigliotti started a fight with the two, and as a 
result, he is credited not only with building the 
Hiawatha jail but also as being its first occupant.10 
But even today, towns like Helper are, from the ground up, 
the visible creations of Italian stone masons. 
The perception 
that the stone masons were from the Tyrol is incorrect.11 
Our 
fieldwork indicated that most of the stone masons were either 
Calabrese or Piemontese--Gigliotti, for instance, was Calabrese. 
Gigliotti's son, Ross, who was 87 in 1990, could point to the

buildings and railroad bridges his father made. 
Other names of 
Italian stone masons recurred in interviews and conversations--
Barzaga, Bianco, Biscardi, Borla, Elegante, Falsetti, Manelli, 
Manina, Putri, Seppi. 
Their stonework forms the physical base 
upon which Helper still stands and Carbon County still runs. 
Stonework was one area where Northern and Southern Italians 
had skills in common, for the roll of stone masons is as filled 
with Piemontese as it is with Calabrese. 
Italian stone masons 
from both the North and the South were called upon not only to 
build houses, stores, and boarding houses for private 
entrepreneurs; they also built the company-owned mining camps, 
including railroad beds, bridges, foundations, and buildings. 
And for city, county, and state government, they built 
embankments, highway bridges, and retaining walls. 
It is all 
built of native sandstone--timber was not plentiful. 
The sheer 
volume of the stone masonry in Helper and in mining camps like 
Columbia, Kenilworth, Hiawatha, and Standardville is astounding 
in itself.l2 
Hiawatha, for instance, where the Nicks spent 10 years in a 
tent, is a good example of a company town built of stone. 
Besides the famous jail (by Felice Gigliotti, 1904) there are the 
major buildings (see IAW-SS-B003; IAW-SS-B004-1-4; IAW-SS-0004-
8-20; IAW-SS-0005; IAW-SS-0006-1-9). 
One section of older houses 
has been destroyed, but the stone foundations still remain. 
12 Siporin, "Folklife and Survival: The Italian Americans of 
Carbon County, Utah," manuscript, pp. 21-23. 
11 
Everywhere there are the stone walls, built to hold back the 
earth. 
Today Hiawatha is eerie because it has many houses, but 
only a few are occupied, and the mine is operating, but humans 
are rarely visible. 
I quote from my essay again: 
Al Veltri, a retired pharmacist in Helper, asked to 
comment on the abundance of stonework, said, "Weren't all 
those Italians stone masons?"13 
In other words, wasn't it 
just another of those many remarkable skills that all these 
immigrants came equipped with? 
Wasn't it ordinary, barely 
worthy of mention? 
Perhaps the historic stonework of Carbon County can 
serve as a metaphor of Italian ethnicity today, as well. 
Stonework is everywhere, underlying everything--a whole 
economy was built on it, and it still provides the 
structure, literally the foundation for life today. 
Newer 
frame houses in Kenilworth, for instance, lie on older 
stonework foundations. 
[See IAW-SS-BO04-38; IAW-SS-BO05-0-
3; IAW-SS-CO08-7-9.] 
But you may not 
unless you train your eye to look for 
spends looking, the more one realizes 
everywhere. 
Maybe Italian ethnicity 
notice the stonework 
it. 
The more time one 
that stonemasonry is 
in Carbon County is also that

way. 
It is not readily apparent with signs saying "look at 
this, it's Italian" or in obvious genres, like language and 
song. 
But at a deep, structural level, that of behavior, 
Italian--and especially Southern Italian--values undergird 
the lives of many members of this society. 
The enduring 
Italianness of Carbon County is apparent not only in 
buildings, houses, fences, embankments, retaining walls, 
highway and railroad bridges--the works of native sandstone 
that form an unmistakable regional landscape shaped by 
skilled, immigrant hands--but also in foodways, matriarchal 
families, large gardens featuring favorite Italian 
vegetables and herbs, historical gravemarkers (in Italian or 
with Italian reference), and the Stella d"America Lodge--the 
oldest fraternal organization in the state of Utah.14 
One dimension of architecture that is hard to discover is an 
invisible dimension--or, perhaps more accurately, a dimension 
that is visible only to members of the group that uses the 
structure. 
This hidden dimension is where sentiment and meaning 
often reside. 
Here is an example from my fieldnotes: 
After breakfast, we went across the street to the 
original Nick homestead. 
The house has had major 
modifications since I was last there--a huge two-car garage 
with a breezeway for starters. 
Inside, Kerry has added new 
14 Siporin, pp. 23-24. 
13 
cabinets, appliances, paneling, etc. 
Most of the material 
was scavenged second-hand from buildings in town. 
Recycling. 
Kerry takes great pride in her carpentry and other 
construction skills.... Originally, their plan was to move 
into this house. 
But the city has delayed so long in 
putting in a sewer along the road that they have remodeled 
their old house instead. 
Now it's not clear what will 
become of this house. 
What is most interesting to me is how evocative for the 
Nicks this really nondescript, barren house and yard site 
is. 
It really looks like decay, and the barren hillside 
[where their father once grew his magnificent garden] grows 
weeds and a few scrawny plants at best. 
But Josephine and 
Kerry seem to see the old, thriving household they grew up 
in. 
Josephine points to a lilac (a barely recognizable 
lilac) and exclaims, "Look, Mom's lilacs!" 
She says the 
same of some flowers I would not have noticed. 
They recall 
the barn, the bake oven, the chickens, and so forth, with 
the enthusiasm of actually seeing them there. 
That's what they see in contrast to the barren 
landscape I see.15

documents a two-story, Piemontese house-type adapted to local

usage. 
Whereas in Piemonte the bottom story would have been used 
for animals and storage, and the top floor would have been living 
and sleeping quarters for humans, in Spring Glen this house was 
built as two apartments, one upstairs and one down--the same form 
but a different function. 
Carter's other architectural drawings include a food storage 
cellar, a babe oven, a garden layout, five identical stone houses 
known as the Milano Court, and the Columbia Steel Company 
Bunkhouse (for coal miners). 
It is also worth noting that in bath Price and Helper, some 
street names have been changed to honor local Italian-Americans--
Fabrizio Street in Helper and Nick Lane--where the old Nick home 
still stands--in Price. 
Gardens 
At the risk of evoking one of the most insidious of Italian-
American stereotypes, I would like to draw upon a scene from the 
film "The Godfather." 
It occurs near the end of the film, when 
Marlon Brando as the godfather has retired from being the "don"; 
he works in his garden, appearing like a typical Italian peasant 
immigrant male of his age and era. 
He has just been advising his 
son and heir, the next "don," with wise words that fittingly 
become his final legacy. 
In the garden scene which follows, he 
plays with his two or three-year-old grandson in the garden and 
is "shot," in play, by the grandson. 
At the same moment, the 
godfather has a heart attack and dies, collapsing in the garden, 
15 
alone with his grandson. 
Although there is a good deal of irony in the gangster who 
survived all challenges being "shot to death" by his grandson, 
that is not my point here. 
I think the godfather's death is, in 
a sense, a "perfect death" by his cultural standards. 
Being with 
one's own grandson in one's own garden means to be in the midst 
of a kind of purity and fulfillment, the final sign of an 
exemplary life, a kind of grace. 
It is a perfect time to die. 
I 
think this is the realm of meaning the garden carries for many 
Italian Americans. 
The importance of gardens in high Renaissance Italian 
culture is well-known as is the garden as a contemporary 
identifier of Italian ethnicity. 
In Carbon County, conditions 
were not promising for gardens--the soil is rocky and unfertile, 
water is scarce--available only through irrigation--and the 
climate is harsher than that of southern Italy. 
Yet Italian 
gardens were an essential part of the domestic economy and 
sentiment here, too, and they still flourish today. 
For some families, gardening became the main economic 
enterprise itself, and they became what is known in other parts 
of the country as "truck-farmers." 
I again quote from the draft 
of my essay: 
Survival periodically became an acute problem for many 
during railroad and mining strikes, especially when strikes 
failed. 
As Philip Notarianni writes elsewhere, after a 1905 
16 
strike and organizing effort was broken, some Italians began 
"truck farms" along the Price River.16 
The traditional 
agricultural skills of the Saccomano family, for instance, 
allowed them to develop a diversified farm which supplied 
fresh fruit and vegetables to the working miners in the 
remote company towns in the mountains: 
These are the boxes that we used to peddle with in 
the wagon. 
We special-made these. 
There'd be sixteen, 
in the wagon. 
We'd fill these with potatoes and 
tomatoes and vegetables... We made them ourselves--
there'd be four across and four down ... [to] fit the 
wagon.17 
The Saccomanos raised 
slaughtered their own 
sausages and salamis, 
sheep for wool and spring lamb, 
pigs to preserve a wide variety of 
and started their vegetables growing 
as early as February by using framed "hotbeds." 
They were 
self-sufficient. 
The wagon and specially-made boxes were 
eventually replaced with a truck, and they continued 
peddling fruit at the mining camps until the late 1960s. 
Today, Charlie Saccomano still raises pigs (for sale), 
rabbits, chickens, and a huge garden. 
There are also

orchards and fields of alfalfa.l8 
The Saccomano farm demonstrates the connections in the landscape 
between architecture and garden and is almost a museum of its own 
history: 
I would like to bring the architecture crew back again 
to record the Saccomano place. 
It has the following 
elements which have been missing in our work thus far: 
-It's a working farm (on a small scale--a "truck" farm, 
although I don't encounter that terminology here). 
Charlie raises pigs (for sale), rabbits, chickens, and 
a huge garden. 
Orchards and alfalfa as well. 
(See 
photos.) 
-The historic part of the farm has "everything": 
*The log house of the original settler (lived in 
by Charlie's father who bought it in the late 
19th century). 
*The first house (stucco) built by the Saccomanos 
*The second house (duplex, 2-level, like Manina?) 
built by the two Saccomano families and shared. 
*Bake oven. 
*The wagon used for fruit peddling. 
*Boxes built to fit this wagon (the original "4 X 
18 Siporin, pp. 15-16. 
18 
4"--four boxes by four 4 boxes filled it 
precisely.) 
*The first truck they peddled produce with. 
*A rig for hanging slaughtered pigs. 
*Outdoor stone kitchen. 
*Smokehouse. 
*Stone chicken coop. 
*Rabbit hutches. 
*Sheep pen. 
*Huge hay barn. 
*"Hot boxes" for starting vegetables early. 
*Well. 
*Stable. 
[IAW-SS-F080690.D] 
Most Italian-Americans in Carbon County were not truck-
farmers, but gardens were an essential part of their domestic 
economy. 
Work in the mines was periodic at best, and the summer 
was the slowest time of all: 
Coal mining was not the regular, dependable, year-
around occupation we expect jobs to be today. 
There was 
more work in the winter (although the number of days per 
week varied), when people heated with coal, but virtually 
none in the summer. 
Lou Colosimo recalls that when he lived 
in Mohrland, Utah, where he was born, his father had only 
19 
about one day's work per month.19 
For miners, income was 
not steady or even predictable. 
Most families lessened 
their dependence on cash income through the enormous gardens 
they planted, the animals they raised, butchered, and 
preserved, and the bread they baked with wood they gathered 
in outdoor ovens they had built. 
These traditional skills 
gave them an economic self-sufficiency without which they 
could not have survived in Carbon County.20 
Although we discussed gardens with many informants, only one 
garden was recorded completely, that of the Brunos: 
The garden is well documented by Tom's photos. 
Note 
its Italian character: 1 1/2 long rows of garlic, a long row 
of fave ("horse beans"), herbs (parsley, sweet basil, 
oregano) a long row of hot peppers, tomatoes, zucchini. 
Also 
fruit trees--cherries, apples, (golden and red delicious) 
apricot, peach, plum, and according to Kerry Fister, the 
only walnut tree in Carbon County. 
The garden is huge--they 
give most of the stuff away--but it's been cut back from 
earlier times. 
Interestingly, I think, when they cut back, 
they didn't do it proportionately. 
They eliminated some of

the less-specifically Italian crops--corn and carrots, for 
instance. 
The regional nature of the garden can be seen in 
the elaborate and careful irrigation system. 
They have 
personally extended the system, tracking their water after 
the garden to their relatives across the street. 
Even 
though these relatives also have "water shares," this is 
more convenient for them, and it conserves the water. 
(In 
some areas of Carbon County, water-rationing has been in 
effect for two years and outside use is totally banned.).

The above description of the garden was recorded early in the 
summer, on June 18, 1990. 
We returned to the Brunos and recorded 
the garden again on August 3: 
Guy, John Bruno"s 80-year old brother from the Bronx, 
21 
is just as enthusiastic about the garden--as if it were his 
own. 
His visit is, in fact, an extended one--about a month. 
Yesterday they harvested the oregano (see photos). 
And they 
harvested the garlic (see photos) a while earlier. 
Both are 
drying in "the shack"--indications that although food 
processing i2n t as c. xta.nsiva, as it once was, it still is 
important. 
The amount of garlic and oregano is far more 
than they'll use, and it is to be shared with neighbors. 
Tom later mentions what he calls the "scorched earth 
policy" of their garden. 
There's really no weeds, and the 
harvested areas are reduced to dirt as well. 
Guy points to 
an area that is no longer planted and tells us that it's 
been "sterilized" and nothing will grow there for seven 
years. 
(Watch that seven!) 
I ask why he did that. 
It's 
because the weeds growing there would seed the rest of the 
garden with weeds. 
But the "weedless look" seems to be 
valued in and of itself, as well. 
[IAW-SS-F08039O.C] 
Garden, landscape, and architecture interrelate intimately, and 
the Brunos' food-processing shed and storage cellar provides a 
good standing example of what seems to have been quite common. 
The cellar is underneath the shed (see Tom Carter's drawings and 
photo-documentation): 
The shed was organized for making salami and other pork 
products. 
Tom photographs it. 
The large trough for mixing 
22 
the pigs' innards is still there. 
Underneath, in the 
cellar, are old wine barrels, hooks and poles suspended from 
the ceiling for hanging the salami, ham and sausage, crocks 
for lard, spigots, etc. 
Now used only to store a few 
apples. 
[IAW-SS-FO6189O.B] 
Our fieldwork includes some discussion of gardening and food 
processing (especially on bread baking, wine making, and pork 
processing) in almost all the interviews 
There is photo-documentation of the Bonacci's garden--in a 
year when virtually no irrigation water was available in their 
area (Spring Glen). 
Photos at the Bonaccis include a shot of a 
beautiful pot of basil and shots showing the neatness of their 
garden and irrigation system. 
There are also some photos of Vito 
Bonacci's "zampone;" Vito refashioned American shovels into 
Italian hoes, a tool not available in America but fundamental in 
Italy. 
Foodways  
Gardens are part of the larger topic of foodways, and are 
discussed immediately above; here I will survey areas such as 
menu, diet, and restaurants. 
Identifiably Italian food is a significant part of the 
regular diet of Carbon County Italian-Americans. 
Richard Raspa 
has written about Italian foodways as ethnic boundary markers 
(see his "Exotic Foods among Italian-Americans of Mormon Utah: 
23 
Food as Nostalgic Enactment of Identity"21 
I have written about 
the conservation of traditional values through foodways 
superseding the preservation of particular dishes or the use of 
"Italian" ingredients in Carbon County.22 
Some informants, when 
asked what part of their diet was Italian, answered that it all 
was. 
When 
regularly, 
It is 
pressed to think of American dishes they ate 
the Bonaccis mentioned macaroni and cheese! 
also worth noting that, to a large extent, Italian 
foodways in Carbon County are regional Italian foodways conserved 
among descendants of immigrants from the various regions. 
Thus 
Piemontese continue to prepare polenta and baana cauda (an 
anchovy and garlic fondue); southern Italian pasta dishes are 
less obviously "regional" because they have become identified in 
America as "Italian," but Calabrian pastries like "ariustazoi," 
tordelli, frazzini, and pitta `upigliatta are common and 
widespread among Calabrese descendants. 
One disappointment to the visitor to Carbon County is that 
there are no Italian restaurants. 
This is not the place to try 
to explain this phenomenon except to note that Italian cooking at 
home continues to thrive in contrast to the lack of restaurants. 
There used to be Italian restaurants, probably to serve the large 
number of single Italian working men in the area in the past.

Dino Cinel points out in his boob, From Italy to San Francisco, 
some early Italian immigrants to the Sari Francisco Bay area 
established themselves by supplying an inexpensive Old World 
cuisine to their savings-conscious countrymen. 
One of the most 
striking stories I encountered was of a widowed Italian immigrant 
who supported her family by baking a hundred, pounds of bread each 
day: 
I was alone. 
This time I had four mouths to feed. 
What did I do? 
I balled my bread. 
Every morning at 5 
o'clock I kneaded one hundred pounds of flour into many 
loaves of my good bread. 
These loaves were baked in an 
outside oven. 
It was not easy, but we had each other and we 
made the best of life at that time. 
You do what you have to 
do and think about it later.23 
Most families appear to have baked their own bread in outdoor 
ovens, usually once a week; Elizabeth Marrelli evidently supplied 
single miners. 
There are two major supermarket chain stores in Price, but 
there are also several smaller, locally-owned grocery stores--at 
least three in Helper alone. 
(There is also Guido Rachiele's 
Checkerboard Grocery in Price; see the interview with him, IAW-
SS-A001.) 
Some Carbon County residents purchase "Italian

supplies" in Salt Lake City, at stores like Granato's, although 
none of the Nicks had ever been to any of those stores. 
Rich 
Colombo owns and is the butcher of J and R Market in Helper, and 
he makes Italian, Slovenian, and garlic sausage on a weekly 
basis. 
The Italian sausage recipe is his grandmother's, but he 
says that some specialties, like soprasatta, are imported from 
Canada. 
The sausage-making process was documented in photos and 
audiotape. 
In my essay, I cited Ann Bonacci recalling the goatherd and 
his cheeses, a familiar part of the Helper milieu of the 1920s: 
We used to have a goat herder. 
He lived way up in the 
mountains.... He'd make cheese out of goat's milk. 
And I 
grew up on that kind of stuff. 
On rigotta--Americans say 
1. ricawta" [laughs]--and all kinds of cheese. 
Something like 
mozzarella, that would melt--it's even tastier than the 
mozzarella we get in the stores .... They used to make cheese 
that you'd grate for your spaghetti.... 
He used to come down with the wagon and his horse-
-little one horse wagon--and he'd bring all his stuff .... He 
had his family up there; they all worked together.24 
According to Ann Bonacci, it was the lack of modern 
pasteurization--not lack of demand--that put the goatherd out of

business. 
Until quite recently, the Calabrian cheese-making 
tradition has been carried forward by Mrs. John Vea, of Spring 
Glen, who was born in Calabria and immigrated as a young adult. 
She made tuma cheese. 
Although cheese-making has ended, her 
family continues to butcher several pigs each November, storing 
the resulting prosciutto, capacolla, soprasatta, salame, and 
sausage in their traditional outdoor cellar. 
I have eaten at the homes of various members of the Nick 
family several times over the years. 
Typically, I am invited to 
eat an "Italian meal"; I am always struck by the way Italian 
dishes are integrated with "American" dishes rather than being 
served as the classical Italian menu of antipasto-primo piatto, 
secondo, etc. 
The meals are true hybrids in style and content. 
Everything is served at once, and the meals are real "gut-
busters." 
Here are two sample menus from the summer's fieldwork. 
The first was served at Palmina (Nick) New's home: 
Lasagna (not something their mother made) 
Ricotta ravioli (ricotta mixed with eggs, garlic, herbs 
rolled in flour, boiled) 
Stuffed zucchini 
Candied yams 
Flat beans 
Tossed salad 
Garlic bread 
Meatballs 
27 
Marinated olives (in oil, parsley, onion, pepper) 
Wine 
Served later: 
Italian cream cake (with ice cream) 
Coffee 
(See IAW-SS-CO01-1-6) 
The second meal was at Kerry Nick Fister"s home: 
Ravioli (homemade) 
Garlic bread 
Candied yams 
Salad 
Marinated olives 
Stewed meat from the tomato sauce 
Breaded chicken cutlets 
Lemonade 
Wine (Tom Carter brought this) 
Green beans with bacon 
Chocolate cake 
Apple pie 
Note that wine does not seem to be an essential part of the meal. 
(At the Bonacci`s, Phil Notarianni brought the wine, and I don't 
think either of the Bonaccis drank any.) 
Yet everyone has 
stories about their fathers making wine, of the sociality 
28 
associated with wine, and of Mormons coming surreptitiously to 
sample it. 
(A story about Mormons, important because it provides 
Italians with a sense of moral superiority over Mormons--
something the Italians perceive the Mormons as always claiming 
over them.) 
At the state liquor store I was told that the 
Italians buy basically two wines--"Paesano" and "Pastoso." 
(IAW-
SS-F080190.C) 
The Italians of Carbon County are not conoscenti  
about wine any longer! 
Today the stories are important, not the 
wine. 
At Al Veltri's I sampled wine his son had made, and Al

Foodways continue to be an important part of celebrations. 
When we visited the Brunos in mid-June, Mrs. Bruno had already 
been preparing a traditional Calabrian wedding cookie, 
..mustazoi," for her granddaughter's wedding the following August. 
(She was still baking more of them as well as other pastries when 
we ret ur ned in August!) 
She also followed the traditional 
Italian custom of

The Nicks are all

garlic bread, there was also a pepper and onion dish--
something like pepperonata, not made by them, but by Rose 
Craven (of an Italian maiden name).

Dried homemade pasta was also being sold. 
Narratives of immigration, survival, and work 
It is hard to separate 
together experientially. 
I 
and I have left these three 
analytically ideas that belong 
am not sure it is important to do so, 
narrative topics together as the most 
important themes of the narratives 
These three themes seem to 
be interwoven in the stories of most first and second generation 
Carbon County Italian-Americans. 
Almost everyone I interviewed had stories to tell about 
their parents' or grandparents' immigration experiences 
A few 
are explored in my essay, but there are more in the tape-recorded 
interviews. 
I think of Mary Nick Juliano's story as the classic, 
even archetypal immigration narrative; it may be literal, but it 
is most certainly mythic in its symbolism and resonance: 
It's still a vivid dream. 
I remember the old 
30 
cobblestone road--just an old road. 
We lived down there 
with my grandmother, my mother's mother, Serafina Sucurro. 
My dad's mother was way up the road, Angela Tangara, and my 
grandpa, Giambattista Nicolavo, my daddy's dad. 
I remember the church, on the right side, and a few 
dear neighbors, on the left. 
I was just a little girl.... 
Poppa didn't have any money, so he planned to come to 
America, and he left Momma and myself at Grandma Serafina's 
home .... My two uncles--no three!--Joe, Matteo, and Luigi--
were home, and we lived with Grandma until Poppa sent money 
for Momma and myself to come to this country.... 
There was a little scene in front of our home there in 
Italy that I'll never forget. 
I hung on to Grandma Sucurro, 
[voice shakes with emotion, on the verge of tears] and 
that's just as vivid as today. 
I wouldn't let go! 
It took 
two or three to unwrap my little arms. 
I was just five! 
And I screamed her name. 
My uncle grabbed me and hugged me 
tight. 
And the last thing I remember--is--that dear, dear 
little grandma, falling on the cobblestone road, screaming 
my name. 
We arrived in this country, but for a year, my 
mother thought I was going to die.25 
Mary's narrative is more than a personal history. 
It is 
told and retold in the Nick family in Price, because it says

something fundamental about immigration. 
Being torn from one's 
grandmother is literal here, but it is also an apt metaphor for 
being torn from one's motherland; and leaving the place where one 
is secure, and sheltered by an extended family, sounds like the 
loss of paradise. 
Such an expulsion is the kind of trauma from 
which one may die--or grow strong.26 
In fact, many immigrants tell similar stories. 
Til 
(Matilda) Davido tells one about her mother, Elizabeth Marelli, 
when she left the same town, San Giovanni in Fiore, for the same 
destination, Carbon County, Utah, to get married, at the age of 
21: 
Til Davido: 
When she got in the carriage to leave, she 
said she could still see her mother running after the 
carriage and crying. 
She said, 'That's something I'll 
never, ever forget--seeing my mother cry when I was 
leaving.' 
Steve Siporin: 
She probably figured she'd never see 
her again. 
Til: 
Yes, and she didn't. 
The only member of their 
family that she ever did see again was her brother, because 
he came here.27

32 
Parting from mother or grandmother was also a parting from 
family, home, and motherland--an event so painful for both women 
that its memory has been inscribed not only in their own minds, 
but in the stories told by their descendants. 
These stories 
typify two different, but common, immigration experiences: those 
of a young woman about to be married and those of a small child. 
Both narratives begin in apparent helplessness, but both are life 
stories of survival, of triumph.28 
Elizabeth Marrelli, Til Davido's mother, looked back at her 
journey over seventy years later, as she approached the age of 
one hundred: 
When I was nineteen, I received letters from America. 
They were written by a gentleman named Francisco 
Felice... Frank's letters and my responses were read and 
written by my aunt who was the village interpreter. 
After 
two years of corresponding, Frank sent me the money to go to 
America and become his wife. 
I left my village, wearing a sign saying Salt Lake 
City, Utah and traveled by train to Naples. 
From Naples I 
traveled by ship to New York City. 
When I arrived in New 
York City, I was stranded for three days because I was 
thirty-five dollars short for my train fare.... 
I had neither food nor money and I was only able to say 
"Helper, Utah America" in English, so I sat on the hard 
28 Siporin, "Folklife and Survival," p. 
6. 
33 
wooden bench alone in the big train depot. 
Finally, a shop 
keeper close by the depot came to help me. 
He was Italian 
and was able to speak with me. 
He wired Frank Felice in 
Helper, Utah and was able to get me the money.... 
My long journey finally ended at Salt Lake City, Utah. 
There I met Francisco Felice. 
He was a very handsome man.29 
Helen Z. Papanikolas, the historian of ethnicity and Greek 
native of multi-ethnic Helper, Utah, recalls that Elizabeth 
Marrelli's journey was not unique: 
I often heard music coming from the Denver and Rio 
Grande Western depot [in Helper] where the uniformed Italian 
marching band met incoming passenger trains. 
They were 
hired to serenade immigrant picture brides, sent by their 
families to marry men they had never seen.30 
Papanikolas's comment may explain the conclusion of Elizabeth 
Marrelli's immigration/marriage narrative--"He was a very 
handsome man." 
The brides were "picture brides," but often they 
had not seen images of the men they were to marry--until they met 
them. 
Men's immigration may have been terrifying in a different

34 
way--for often there was no one waiting to meet then, at the end 
of the journey. 
There was no end--one had to make one's end: 
i.e., find work and create a new life. 
Guido Rachiele, who today 
runs the Checkerboard Grocery in Price, tells an ironically 
humorous--though frightening--story about his father's journey 
from Reggio di Calabria to Carbon County. 
According to Guido, 
his father arrived in 1909 and first worked in Philadelphia as a 
cook for a construction crew. 
Then, based on the encouragement 
of others who had gone west, he headed for Southern California, 
because, as his friends had said, it resembled Southern Italy. 
But an encounter with cowboys in Elko, Nevada, threw his ultimate 
destination open to chance: 
When they were in Elko, there was a holdover, and it 
was about the time one of these cattle drives came into 
Elko. 
And of course the cowboys were jubilant: they were 
hitting Elko. 
They began shooting, they began hollering, 
and so my dad and his two companions got scared. 
Not 
knowing what was happening, they jumped off the freight--the 
passenger train, and headed off into the sagebrush--
worrying, that someone was after them, with all the 
shooting! 
So they stayed in the sagebrush all night. 
The 
next morning, when it became daylight, there was a passenger 
train, so they got on the passenger train. 
But not knowing 
that it wasn't going to California, it was heading back to 
Salt Lake .... So Elko was as close to California as he was 
35 
able to get!... 
There was a fellow in Salt Lake that said, 'I'm going 
to Carbon County to get a job in the coal mines.' 
So they 
got on a train and come back to Carbon County and was able 
to get a job ... in Mohrland .... And he and his two buddies got 
jobs in the coal mines there. 
And he became a settler of 
Carbon County.31 
Our tape-recorded interviews include many accounts of 
travelling back and forth between Italy and the United States, 
tending to confirm Dino Cinel's thesis about the dynamic nature 
"immigration," particularly before World War I. 
There are 
stories of abandonment and stories of ties maintained. 
Vito Bonacci and others tell stories about strikes, 
persecution, and mutual aid among immigrant families. 
Edna 
Romano answered my question about how families survived strikes: 
By helping each other! 
Those that had the farms and the 
cows and the milk helped the others .... They had huge 
gardens—and, all kinds of animals .... I think about all 
people ever bought, my mother said, was the coffee and 
sugar. 
But they all helped each other .... They could stay 
out on strike and hold up because they really stuck

36 
together.32 
Northern Italians in Helper created their own mutual aid society, 
the Stella di America. 
Informally, members sometimes bartered 
their goods and services--Edna Romano recalls how her mother, 
then a young girl, was paid in milk bottles for helping a mother 
with her newborn baby.33 
Dominick Besso, the shoemaker, tells the ironic story of how 
is brother-in-law was spared from the big Castle Gate mine 
explosion of 1924. He had gotten drunk the night before and 
didn't make it to work that day (IAW-SS-A 
). 
But the opposite 
story--of how Edna Borla's father (?) returned early from a trip 
and went back to work in the mine early and was killed in an 
accident, is also told (IAW-SS-A 
). 
The interview with Kerry Nick Fister (IAW-SS- 
) is 
filled with narratives about growing up in a big Italian-American 
family in Hiawatha and Price. 
Other versions of many of these 
same stories were collected by me in 1983. 
Mary Nick Juliano has 
made some of them into poems. 
It was also interesting to find some fragments of Italian 
marchen and recollections of storytelling sessions: 
"Cuoco, cuoco 
"Cook, cook

of the kitchen, 
What is the king doing 
with the slave queen?" 
"Suona e canta e balla." 
"He plays, sings, and 
dances"34 
This rhymed refrain is part of a marchen (perhaps a cante-fable) 
recalled by Ann Bonacci of Helper. 
A witch has turned a prince 
into a butterfly; he flutters at the window of the palace, asking 
what has become of the queen. 
Ann Bonacci and Til Pavido recall the fairy tales told by 
Frank Scavo, Carmana and Margaret Felice, Nick Vecchio, and Fred 
Nicastro in their Italian neighborhood of "Townsite" in Helper. 
One told the tales from "A Thousand and One Nights"; another told 
"Cicirinella" (Cinderella). 
Such stories were told in the 
evenings when people visited each other, especially in the winter 
when everyone gathered around the coal-burning kitchen stove: 
There was a lot of storytelling when we were kids. 
Lots of storytelling. 
We'd get together at nights with 
neighbors.... He [Fred Nicastro] used to come up every--
maybe three times a week, and oh!--he'd tell the most 
fantastic stories .... we would just wait for the night that

he'd come over .... He started to tell us the story of "A

We 
just could not wait for him to tell us those stories.35 
Gravemarkers 
Almost the first thing Tom Carter and I did on our initial 
ViPJ•. •ti, O.Artl l 
 
for 
px^o tji_=•.i•t 
to vioiit the Helper 
cemetery. 
Phil Notarianni also shot slides of gravemarkers and 
all together we documented five "major" cemeteries--Helper, 
Spring Glen, Price (the largest by far), Castle Gate, and 
Sunnyside (the densest concentration of Italian gravemarkers 3 
with many early gravemarkers in Italian)--as well as some smaller 
cemeteries like the one buried under coal dust at Hiawatha and 
others that had few Italian gravemarkers--like Scofield, 
Carbonville, Wellington, and Haycock. 
The gravemarkers provide strong indications of regional 
Italian identification continuing for the immigrant generation 
since older gravemarkers often include the natal town and/or 
province and may be written partly or completely in Italian. 
Then there is the seemingly odd gravemarker marked "born in 
Itley"--good evidence that, at least in this case, the gravestone 
carver was not Italian and the Italian customer did not know 
English, resulting in a typical American mispronunciation 
35 Tape-recorded interview with Til Pavido, Price, Utah.

39 
uncritically recorded on a gravemarker. 
If there were not 
Italian gravestone carvers, it is surprising there were not more 
errors of this kind. 
Phil and Maria Notarianni and myself were puzzled by the 
Italian of one gravemarker in Helper: 
Qui Giace

1917 
The desolated parents 
and siblings place this. 
But Maria, a native Italian speaker, says that, this does not 
really make sense grammatically. 
It seems likely that many of the immigrants were semi-
literate, that they spoke dialect rather than standard Italian, 
and perhaps the gravemarkers sometimes can be explained as 
reflecting these two facts. 
Older gravemarkers, in Italian, 
contain some widely variant spellings and forms of Italian words, 
including place names. 
Matriarchal familv  
I would like to conclude with a brief mention of this aspect 
of continuity with the Old World--briefly because it is only a 
41 
tentative idea in my own mind. 
According to Ann Cornelison, in 
her books like Women of the Shadows: The Wives and Mothers of 
Southern Italv,36 Southern Italy is, and always has been, a 
matriarchy and a society of sharp division between the men's and 
women's world: 
I believe that the social structure of Southern Italian 
villages, archetypical peasant societies, is 
matriarchal .... It is a de facto system, one that is felt by 
everyone, that functions every day, but is not codified and 
does not have to be recognized. 
It is simply there. 
There 
are no large decisions to be made by the men and day-by-day 
existence is left to the women, who unconsciously take over 
all the practical aspects of life.37 
The continuity of the matriarchy with the pre-Christian South is 
visible in religion: 
The Marian cult exists and has become the core of local 
belief.... Mary, the Earth-Mother figure, can be loved, 
trusted and prayed to, while God and His son, Jesus, remain 
cold symbols.... Much as the Vatican may deplore it, in the

The cleavage between the world of men and the world of women has 
increased in the past century with the absence of the many men 
who are working abroad--earlier in the Americas, now in 
Switzerland, Germany, 
strongly matriarchal, 
their husbands having 
North Italy, and elsewhere. 
The family is 
and women basically run everything at home, 
become occasional visitors. 
When I first visited the Nick family in 1983, it struck me 
that Cornelison's vision described them well. 
Both Josephine and 
Palmina's husbands had died young (and thus were "absent"), and 
the sisters raised their children and worked, becoming strong and 
self-sufficient. 
In some places I refer to Kerry's husband, 
Phil, as a "drone."39 
He's present, but seems always peripheral; 
he was riot successful financially (he was a cook and bartender), 
and Kerry is still the "doer" in their family. 
Mary, the oldest 
sister, was married to another immigrant, but he never learned to 
speak English and depended on her. 
I met him only once at their 
home; Mary seemed to operate completely independently of him. 
The center of these women's lives seem to me to be with each

39 In rereading Cornelison, I discovered that she used the 
same word: 
Why, for instance, do the women in one village compete to 
see which of them can 'keep her husband in the Piazza' with 
good clothes on his back and money in his pockets? And who 
in highest style? 
The men are drones, publicly on show to 
prove their wives' superiority.

other, not with their husbands. 
They help each other in the most 
basic ways, sharing each other's joys and sorrows. 
They joke 
with each other and tease incessantly. 
Their children and 
grandchildren seemed almost interchangeable; that is, they are 
equally comfortable with aunt or mother, and in each other's 
homes. 
The daughters and granddaughters also seem to be 
socialized to this female-centric world, helping each other with 
babysitting, economically, with volunteer efforts for the church, 
and so on. 
At the family gatherings I saw all of the women as 
the active agents, the men as passive, in an alien milieu. 
When 
Mary Nick Juliano, in her story about leaving her grandmother in 
Calabria, said that her grandmother was "the love of my life," I 
thought, "Of course." 
In this southern Italian world, the real 
loving relationships--the relationships in which one person cares 
and understands and sacrifices for another--are more common 
between women than between women and men. 
Women meet most of 
their needs in a world of women, and men meet most of their needs 
in a world of men. 
Thus it seems to me that a "hidden dimension," a deep 
behavioral dimension of southern Italian life, remained strong 
and ever present in the life of the Nick family. 
I do not know 
how generalized this pattern is (if, indeed, there even is such a 
pattern) among other southern Italian households in Carbon 
County. 
There are other topics that could be pursued from our field-
44 
collected materials--like the "standard" North/South rivalry, 
which even leads to different perceptions of local history. 
Stanley Littizette, for instance, a descendent of early 
Piemontese immigrants, denies the widespread presence of outdoor 
bakeovens our Calabrese informants all recalled. 
We do not know 
the proportions of Piemontese and Calabrese descendants in Carbon 
County today, but it appears that these are the two major groups. 
There seems to have been a major shift in regional Italian 
representation in Carbon County during the Depression, when many 
immigrants left for California and elsewhere. 
It appears, for 
instance, that there were numerous Abruzzessi until then, but we 
did not find any today. 
Even if we exhausted all the topics our fieldwork suggests, 
we would certainly not have exhausted all that Carbon County 
Italian-Americans have to offer. 
In several weeks of fieldwork, 
I think we were treated to the icing on the cake. 
I hope we saw 
and conveyed some impression of what lies beneath.
