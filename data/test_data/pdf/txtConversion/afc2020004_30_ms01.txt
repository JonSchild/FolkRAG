1918 Union Valley Road Oklahoma 
 
 
 
I 
 
Maybe it was while reading the 1918 Union Valley Bulletin  
A political handbill given John Hoggatt by a hacking cougher at the feed store  
Maybe it was the sour apple gone mahogany black that he’d eaten from his wife’s cellar stash  
He knew he should have given it to Trudy their hog 
Maybe it was the six-mile walk to and from his father’s farm in Stonewall  
 
Just to ask, need help with that heifer, Pop?   
Maybe it was the burning tingling running over the top of John’s head   
As if he was being roasted alive, filling him with fear 
 
He coughed into his fist, no  
Iva honey, lock the gate so the Crowder boys can’t steal our cow 
He coughed into his fist, no  
 
Iva honey, 
He coughed into his fist  
Iva, so cold.  
 
Winds like a siren whip the Junipers outside, maybe 90 per, 
He swayed left, and then right, and onto their Jenny Lind bed  
A wedding gift,  
Coveralls still on. 
 
 
 
 
II 
 
Shocked into  
consciousness  
by sunlight  
Iva supports  
herself with her  
arms and leans  
forward Eyes  
mucus glued 
Has she been  
crying in  
her sleep? 
 
The bed  
is cold, the  
stove out Her  
long black  
hair matted by  
 
high fevers. In  
her dreams,  
the sound  
of a gurgling  
brook She  
looks  
at John, her  
teeth chattering 
He is completely  
blue now. She  
presses on  
John’s  
chest. Blood  
and mucus slip  
between his blue  
lips Breathe, John,   
Breathe. 
 
Don’t  
worry I  
gave our baby  
girl to your  
sister, Euda   
Yesterday,  
the day  
before,  
maybe last  
week, but  
she’s safe. 
Didn’t make  
a sound, just  
waved bye-bye,  
Bye-bye,  
Mommy  
bye-bye. 
Like you,  
she doesn’t  
complain Like  
you, she’s more  
Irish than 
Cherokee –  
like me. 
 
Breathe, John, 
Breathe. Take  
a breath, John  
Hoggatt.  How  
many times?   
Iva curls  
up by his  
side, played  
 
out Who hast  
never bruised  
a living  
flower, she  
whispers. Now  
I lay  
me down  
to sleep I  
pray  
the Lord  
my soul to  
take.  
Breathe,  
John. 
 
 
III 
  
The sun is yet a rumor  
Iva sleeps like the dead  
Until she doesn’t. 
On the third day she feels herself rising  
 
 
Everything a moving cloud, 
She observes herself in the mirror  
Washes her mahogany cheeks  
That’s odd, she thinks  
Lock the gate, John, 
Or the Crowder boys will steal our cow. 
 
She coughs into her handkerchief   
John honey,  
She coughs into her handkerchief  
John honey,  
She coughs into her handkerchief   
Hear me.  
 
Yes Iva   
You live in unmeaning dreams, he says, 
The grave is ready. 
 
John honey 
Stay 
 
I washed your Sunday shirt  
Hung it on the line to dry     
We can bury our faces  
In summer laundry  
 
Taste the scent of sun 
In a field of light  
 
Breathing as one  
 
Stay  
 
 
IV 
 
 
Iva is dreaming again 
She hears his name, John, 
The sound like a bell on her tongue,   
                                                 John 
                                                      on 
                                                        on 
 
 
 
                   on 
                                              g-  
 
Breathe
