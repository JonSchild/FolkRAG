Chi Eta Phi Sorority Incorporated is a professional nurse organization comprised of registered nurses
and nursing students. Aliene C. Ewell, Registered Nurse, organized the Sorority on October 16, 1932
with the assistance of 11 other courageous registered nurses: Henrietta Smith, Mildred Wood Lucas,
Lillian Moseley Boswell, Katherine Chandler Turner, Susan Elizabeth Freeman, Bessie Foster Cephas,
Clara Belle Royster, Clara E. Beverly, Ruth Garrett, Gladys L. Catchings and Olivia Larkins. The
charter chapter, Alpha, was organized at Freedmen's Hospital in Washington D.C., at a time when
African-American nurses were denied membership to other national nurse organizations. The conception
of Chi Eta Phi Sorority Incorporated had two specific purposes: to elevate the plane of nursing and
increase interest in the field of nursing. The graduate chapters and undergraduate chapters, known as
Beta chapters, are grouped into five regions according to geographic areas. The chapters are located
throughout the United States, District of Columbia and St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands. The Sorority is
guided by the motto, service for humanity. The Sorority houses programs focusing on health promotion
and disease prevention, leadership development, mentoring, recruitment, retention and scholarship. The
vision of Chi Eta Phi Sorority Incorporated is that it is an internationally recognized leader in developing
healthy communities through advocacy, collaboration, education, leadership, research and service. The
mission of the Sorority is the encouragement of the pursuit of continuing education, recruitment
programs for health careers, the stimulation of close and friendly relationships among its members, the
development of working relationships with other professional groups, the identification of a core of
nursing leaders who will affect change, social changes, at the national, regional and local levels. Again,
the Sorority motto is service for humanity. The Sorority colors are pea green and lemon yellow. The
mascot is the turtle. Yes, the turtle. And you may ask, Why the turtle? Because the turtle is persevering,
sure-footed, purposefully directed, determined and a risk-taker. The Sororityâ€™s programs and projects
include disease prevention and health promotion through health screenings and health education. Health
screenings are methods developed to identify potential and actual health problems in targeted
populations and high-risk groups. Emphasis is placed on hypertension education and screening, which is
the organization's signature project, cancer education and screening, sickle cell disease awareness.
Programs for seniors provide various services such as travel assistance, health education, assistance with
navigating the healthcare system and there is also a system in place to check on the well-being of elderly
persons who live alone. Other projects and programs for seniors are developed to meet the individual
needs of the various communities. Programs for youth and young adults may include health education
sessions, peer forums, mentoring and healthcare experiences. The Community Health and Outreach
Program is designed to serve the members of Chi Eta Phi Sorority Incorporated. Leadership
Development is designed to assist the membership and the development of effective leadership skills.
Research Development is designed to provide assistance to novice and seasoned researchers with
scholarly activity that addresses research investigating health promotion, disease prevention and health
maintenance projects in vulnerable and underserved populations. Scholarship is a means where the
Sorority provides financial assistance to nursing students who meet established criteria as identified by
the national office. Recruitment and Retention: This program is provided to promote interest in nursing
careers, to provide financial, tutorial assistance and mentoring. These are offered to matriculating
undergraduate and graduate students enrolled in accredited nursing programs. The men and women who
are members of Chi Eta Phi Sorority Incorporated come from various cultural and ethnic backgrounds.
They are multi-talented and hold various educational degrees, while the Beta, the undergraduate
members, are in pursuit of nursing degrees and Registered Nurse licensure. Through our collective
efforts, we are able to intentionally, effectively and proudly uphold our motto: service for humanity.
