I NGS THE  BLUES
 
Pete Seeger says:
 
"Mable Hillery i
s a f
ine s
inger o
f
 
t
raditional Afro- A merican folk
 
music: blues, ballads and child-
ren's songs.  But more than this,
 
she i
s a wonderfully war m hu man
 
being, and i
s able to co m municate
 
fro m the stage.  A
. t
ruly exciting
 
perfor mer.
 
Alan Lo max says:
 
T
I
 The voice of Mable Hillery r
ings
 
s
trong with the wo man's b
lues,
 
and i
t's been a long t
ime s
ince
 
a good wo man's blues was heard.
 
She has sung with the best in the
 
country--the Georgia Sea I
sland
 
Singers, John Hurt, Brownie and
 
Sonny.
 Mable has not forgotten
 
the spirited tradition handed down
 
to her by a fa mily o
f s
ingers and
 
dancers."
 
Mable Hillery was born in the heart of
 
the South, and grew up hearing, l
earn-
ing, and s
inging the work songs, blues,
 
and religious songs of rural Georgia.
 
While s
till in school she began writing
 
her own songs.  As a young g
irl she
 
moved to the c
ity and continued t
o grow
 
with the Negro b
lues and jazz sounds of
 
the t
i me.
 
About thirteen years ago, she moved to
 
the sea i
sland of St. Si mon's on the
 
coast of Georgia, and there she l
earned
 
many o
ther songs dating back to s
lavery
 
t
i mes.  I
t was here that she began her
 
professional s
inging career as a me mber
 
of the Georgia Sea I
sland Singers.
 
Blues have always been the songs c
losest
 
to Mable Hillery's heart.  She has l
ived
 
with the blues, and knows what the blues
 
are all about.  In 1965, she decided to
 
start s
inging the blues professionally,
 
and the world hasn't been the sa me s
ince.
 
She began to have a following of devoted
 
fans after she sang at the Ash Grove in
 
Los Angeles that sa me year.

I

 and at colleges 3ncl c

in many areas o
f the country.
 
She has sung with Jesse Fuller, Skip
 
Ja mes, Muddy Waters and h
is bancl,Son
 
House and many o
ther great blues
 
perfor mers.
 
Mable Hillery has been heard on WB AI
 
Radio  in New York and seen on t

in Canada.  She just recently co mpleted
 
a very successful concert tour of England,
 
where she also appeared on t

She has cut an LP to be released soon
 
on the English Xtra label, t
itled Ain't
 
I
t Hard to Be a Nigger in Georgia.(acco m-
panied by an English jazz band.)
 
Mable Hillery i
s very concerned about
 
the future of traditional folk music, and
 
has been g
iven a grant by the Newport
 
Folk Foundation to work on several
 
projects designed to preserve pride in
 
the folk heritage among those who are
 
still part of i
t.  She has organized
 
several festivals in her own area of
 
Georgia, and has participated for sev-
eral years i
n the Southern Folk M usic
 
Tour, which yearly visits college ca m-
puses and co m munities, both white and
 
black, in twelve southern s
tates.
 
Mable Hillery's s
inging recalls the o
ld
 
t
i me s
tyle of Ma Rainey and Bessie
 
Smith; she i
s said to be the greatest
 
fe male blues s
inger in the country t

s a place with woods -

river on one s

woods in between -

 different roads, and the old
 
fort, and the old Spanish moss that hangs on the

t's Just a beautiful place to l
ive...
 
And I think that it's one of the most wonderful
 
places in the world...
 
St. S
imon's I
sland, Georgia, is one l
ink in the i
sland chain
 
that curves a
long the eastern shoreline of North American from Canada to
 
F
lorida, to tail off, at l
ast, into the Bahamas and the leeward i
slands of
 
the Caribbean.  Each i
sland is different from the next; each i
sland population
 
i
s special.  The particular distinction of St. Simon's i
s that among i
ts
 
people has been preserved one of the oldest layers of Afro-American culture
 
still viable within the United States.  Musically speaking, that venerable
 
l
ife-style has been represented for the past fifty years by the Georgia Sea
 
I
sland Singers, a unique local organization of black working men and women,
 
s
elf-dedicated t
o thnserving and performing the proud music of their forebears.

964, John Davis, Mabel Hillery, Bessie Jones, Henry Morrison
 
and Emma Lee R
amsey came to California as representatives of the l
arger group
 
of Singers back home on St. Simon's.  They had been singing in a l
ot of
 
s
trange c
offeehouses and before many unfamiliar kinds of people, but they
 
were s
till adventurous and energetic enough to be interested in the idea of
 
making a f
ilm of some of thetr songs.  At the time, I was teaching in the
 
Anthropology Department of San Fernando Valley State College where an exper-
imental e
thnographic film program had been set up under the leadership of

t

hairman, E
dmund Carpenter.  D
r. Carpenter persuaded
 
s
ome friends in the professional f
ilm industry to donate t
heir technical
 
s
ervices and arranged for us to use a c
ollege sound s
tage and recording
 
e
quipment.  No one c
onnected with the f
ilm besides myself had e
ver s
een t
he
 
S
ingers, nor, indeed, knew much about the l
ives they l
ed or the tradition
 
they represented.  The S
ingers had not been f
ilmed before, e
xcept within
 
a theatrical c
ontext.  When we assembled, one hot quiet Sunday afternoon,
 
I don't think anyone had much of an idea what would happen.
 
A few points had been s
ettled.  The Sea I
slanders wanted t
o c
on-
centrate on t
heir religious repertoire; though t
hey knew a variety of s
ecular
 
s
ongs and d
ances, their religious material was the philosophical and e
motional
 
core of a
ll their presentations.  From the f
ilm-aaker' s
ide, Dr. Carpenter
 
had decided not to a
ttempt a
 make-shift "realistic" background, but t
o
 
s
tage the f
ilming against a plain b
lack curtain.  This would enable t
he
 
c
ameramen t
o use angle shots impractical under documentary f
ield conditions,
 
and a
lso permit dissolves and fades in l
ater cutting, thus t
urning t
he s
terile
 
s
tudio c
onditions t
o a positive account.  But theme were the only points that
 
had really been settled in advance.
 
We worked a
ll afternoon.  Mrs. Jones' knees were badly s
wollen w
ith
 
arthritis and she moved with d
ifficulty; John Davis had only recently recovered
 
from a heart a
ttack.  The s
ound man, under the reasonable, though culture-
bound, a
ssumption that the S
ingers c
ould l
ip-synch their performances l
ike
 
Hollywood veterans, d
id not bother to try f
or proper "presence" i

is micro-
phone s
et-ups, and this was not d
iscovered until half the afternoon had gone
 
by.  (

slanders c
o-operatively tried l
ip-synching, i

 and Dr. Carpenter and I s
tood by i
n frustration
 
while Mrs. Jones, f
illed with the spirit, sang on and on and the c
ameramen
 
packed their gear and wound up the e
lectric cables.
 
Altogether, out of the I
slanders' total repertoire of hundreds
 
of religious s
ongs, we had f
ilmed s
ix.  Four are included in "The Georgia
 
Sea I
sland Singers".  Edmund Carpenter and Archer Goodwin edited and c
ut
 
the footage; I acted a
s editorial advisor; continuity and narration were
 
added l
ater from extracts of a taped conversation held between John Davis,
 
h
is brother Peter, Bessie Jones and Alan Lomax.
 
S
ince that afternoon in 1*64, John Davis has died.  This f
ilm
 
remains one of the f
ew records in e
xistence of that wholly remarkable human
 
s
pirit.
 
MOSES
  
John Davis once told me that he knew seven songs about Moses, and
 
that they covered the entire Biblical story from birth to death.  I don't
 
believe he ever recorded them all, not even in the long series of sessions
 
he had with Alan Lomax, who recorded John's repertoire more thoroughly than
 
anyone e
lse.  John l
iked to drop hints about special songs he knew; when you
 
pressed h
im to s
ing them, he would say that he wanted to save a few "
so you'll
 
have to come back to see me".  I
t was at John's insistence that this stately
 
and foreboding spiritual was included in the repertoire we filmed.  I had been
 
afraid that i
t would be too static.  When we looked at the footage l
ater,
 
became c
lear that John's aesthetic judgment had been far more perceptive
 
t
aan mine; the I
slanders' bodies sway together and apart l
ike a field of reeds,
 
just as their voices mesh and interlock in the grave cadences of this rare
 
and ancient s
ong.

On S
t. S
imon's, this ancient African cult dance has been translated
 
i
nto t
heological terms which reflect tragic memories of s
lavery in the
 
"
Christian" nineteenth century.  The handkerchief around which the buzzard
 
dancer c
ircles i
s the body of a s
lave, denied burial and thrown out in the
 
woods l
ike a dead animal.  The Buzzard tiptoes around the body, advancing
 
and retreating to make sure i
t i
s truly dead, and f
inally fulfills the
 
ancient African role of messenger by carrying the sacrifice back to the L
ord.
 
Meanwhile the watching s

When we began to shoot the Buzzard Lope, John Davis put o
n h
is
 
suit jacket.  I reminded him that he had not been wearing it in the earlier
 
shots and suggested that he remove i
t.  Later on, when he saw the footage,
 
he remarked that if I had "let him" wear i
t, he could have made "the wings
 
f
lap better".  I hadn't understood that part of t
he aesthetic, and John h
ad
 
been t
oo c
ourtly and k
ind to embarrass me publicly by pointing i
t out.
 
I
n his younger days, John used to pick up the handkerchief in his
 
teeth and whirl around and around with it before f
inal'y carrying i
t away,
 
but he said he was too o
ld to do that anymore.  John told me, too, that none

On St. Simon's, the typical accompaniment for "Adam in the Garden"
 
i
s a broom-handle, held vertically and beaten on the f
loor l
ike a r
ice-
pounder -
-
 or an Ashanti s
pear.  John Davis was a
lways very particular about
 
the correct resonance of this instrument and would refuse to "beat stick"
 
i
n an asphalt t
ile or l
inoleum floor.  The broom handle was traditionally
 
the only instrument used in Sea I
sland religious music; the Singers had
 
accepted Mrs. Jones' mainland importation of the tambourine, but note of
 
the native-born i

 I
n t

hey put t

the f

t l
ike a
 
buzzard dancing around a cow -
-
 a dead cow or
 
mule or s
omething.
 
Peter Davis:
 Well, that's the way they feel, you see -
-
according to how they were treated, you under-
s
tand me.  They said they were nothing but the
 
old dead carrion that they would throw away in
 
woods someplace; and then the buzzard would come
 
around, you know, and pick off the carrion.  The
 
angel was the buzzard that come p
ick up the soul
 
out of the old dead carrion...

 The "Buzzard L
ope", one of the most remarkable i
tems in t
he Sea
 
7 
I
slanders' repertoire, i
s not a "
shout". "Shouts"invariably involve whole
 
congregations; the "Buzzard L
ope" stands unique, the only solo dance in the
 
S
ingers' religious repertoire.
 
I
ts' roots are plainly African.  Melville Herskovits, the pioneer
 
i
nvestigator i
nto Afro-American anthropology, has provided h
ints a
s to i
ts
 
u
ltimate origin among the Ashanti-Fanti peoples of the Gold Coast, among
 
whè*mthe vulture  was a s
acred messenger who bore sacrifices to the gods.
 
During t
he 1
930's, i
n S
urinam, Herskovits saw "Opete" (
a Twi word for
 
culture) dancers among the Bush Negroes; under possession, Opete cult members
 
go out t
o f
ind dead animals for food.  "Those who danced for the buzzard...
 
went about i
n a c
ircle, moving with bddies bent f
orward from their waists

words o
f the accompanying song with their arms and upper bodies.  Their feet,
 
meanwhile, move in the "
shout step" -
-
 a f
lat-footed s
lide, with one foot in
 
the l
ead.  I
t i
s particularly important not to cross the feet or l
egs; such
 
a move would be "dancing", not "
shouting", and dancing in church i
s clearly
 
impious.
 
When we c
ame t
o film "Adam in the Garden", John Davis suggested
 
that we not include Mabel Hillery.  "Mabel can't shout", he said; "now,
 
Bessie (
Jones), she can't shout either, but she c
an walk around just fine."
 
Mrs. Jones had been born on the Georgia mainland and moved to St Simon's
 
only after her marriage in the e
arly 1
920's.  In some s
ignificant respects,
 
therefore, she s
till remains an outlander; and thus she does not attempt the
 
shout s
tep here, though l
ater -
-
 in "Down In the Mire" -
-
 she '
walks around"
 
l
ike an Egyptian queen on a frieze.
 
Mabel Hillery -
-
 island-born and herself a grandmother -
-
 was the
 
youngest and most up-to-date of the Singers.  I
t seemed impossible to leave
 
her out of the f
ilm (
there should have been many more participants anyway),
 
though she agreed quite cheerfully that she couldn't shout properly, pointing
 
out "
I just can't keep my heels down".  So she picked up (
or pinned up) l
eaves
 
with the rest of the I
slanders; but at the end of the song, she crossed her
 
feet in a s
ignificant, though probably quite unconscious, kinâsic s
tatement.
 
She had gone a
long with the old ways as well as she could, but now that that
 
was o
ver....
 
Oh Eve, tell me, where i
s Adam?
 
Oh, Eve!
 
Adam in the garden, picking up l
eaves...

Adam wouldn't answer.

The Sea I
slanders take the Bible very seriously.  Biblical texts
 
weaverthbeh h their everyday conversations; they enjoy arguing over the inter-
pretation of s
criptural texts, and they re-enact Biblical stories in their
 
holy dances or "shouts".  The "shout" has almost disappeared now as a viable
 
form of religious worship, but at one time it represented a workable doctrinal
 
compromise between two variant cultural stances: European Protestantism,
 
which held that dance was inherently s
inful or worldly, and African poly-theism
 
in which dance was an intrinsic part of a
ll significant activities, secular
 
and religious.  "
Shouting" -
-
 an organized form of worship conducted i
n
 
church -
-
 emerged as a form of behavior acceptable to both groups.
 
"Shouting", thus, has very s
trict rules, none of which h
ave to do
 
with vocalization; the term itself appears to s
tem from the Arabic word,
 
"saut", meaning, variously, to jump or to march.  In a "shout", participants
 
proceed i

Dear Dave:
 
It was nice to get a chance to chat with you the other day; I hope I
 
didn't take up too much of your time.
 
I
'm enclosing the Radim catalogue.  I know they're getting out a new
 
one, and I
'd suggest you write off for it; while I was in Chicago, Art
 
Brown was buying new films right and left, including the best one I ever
 
saw on a hunting and gathering people called "The Last of the Cuiva"
 
(
a South American tribe), a really gorgeous film, humane, admiring and
 
wise.
 
In this catalogue, the two films I was in on are listed on pages 18 and
 
19; "Say, Old Man, Can You Play the Fiddle?" -
-
 the one on the Missouri
 
fiddler, Earl Collins -
-
 will be listed in the new catalogue.  The only
 
other I film I
've been involved with (
the study of the traditional
 
Black singing games filmed in Los Angeles, "Pizza Pizza Daddy-O") is
 
distributed by Media Center, Extension Division, University of California,
 
Berkeley.  They'll send you all the info about it on request.
 
I
'll look forward to seeing your article and bibliography -
-
 also to seeing
 
you sometime this spring.  In the meantime, all the best,

'HE GEORGIA SEA ISLAND SINGERS
 
The original group of the Georgia Sea Island Singers was organized by
 
Mrs. Maxfield Parrish on St. Simon's Island near Brunswick, Georgia, in
 
the 1920's.  At the time, there were no roads into the island, and the
 
Negro communities had been isolated and virtuilly self governing since
 
the Civil War.  The original members of the group were all great folk singers
 
who remembered songs that dated back at least a century -
 rowing songs,
 
longshoremen songs, ring games, and especially the shouts, those vigorous
 
rhythmic progenitors of the spiritual.  They agreed among themselves to
 
cultivate the "old-time" way of singing and to admit new, younger people
 
into the group, only if they would conform to the tradition the group
 
esteemed.  The present group continues without change a tradition of singing
 
that goes back to the roots of American Negro music.  During three years
 
of professional touring, the Sea Islanders have performed for night club,
 
folk festival, classroom and concert audiences, weaving the songs together
 
with amusic and informative narration.  Onstage, the powerful singers take
 
their audience into a stirring and unforgettable experience of the best of
 
Negro folk life and music.

Newspaper reaction to the Georgia Sea Islanders:
 
Atlanta, Georgia, 1963:  SEA ISLAND'S FOLK SINGERS TOP THE BEST: The
 
Georgia Sea Island Singers dusted off an almost forgotten slave style of
 
vocalizing to run away with the plaudits at the biggest -
 and best - 
folksong festival held in Atlanta.
 
The New York Times, Robert Shelton, 1965:  The program was a vibrant ex-
cursion into authentic folk song.  The Sea Island quintet is a fascinating
 
group whose choral call-and-response singing, energetic dancing, and brightly
 
rhythmic hand-clapping held the audience of nearly 500 persons engrossed...
 
The performers put on a show as musically appealing as it was intellectually
 
stimulating.
 
Providence News: 1964:  The Georgia Sea Island Singers, an outstanding hit
 
at this year's festival...
 
San Francisco Sunday Chronicle, 1962:
 (Dean Wallace).  No description can
 
do justice to these singers; they have to be heard to be enjoyed.  There
 
are a pair of tremendous solo singers named Bessie Jones and John Davis,
 
backed by a miscellaneous group of fishermen and boatyard workers who could
 
hold their own against any professional ensemble in the business.
 
The Pasadena Art Museum, Mrs. Eve Eshelman, Director, 1963:
 I am personally
 
very grateful to you for coming to the Pasadena Art Museum.
 Everything
 
that we had heard about your group before was surpassed by the reaction tha
 
I had from the people who heard you in performance.
 
UCLA Campus Newspaper, 1963;  Among the traditional folk singers appearing
 
at the Folk Music Festival, Bessie Jones is the most impressive.
 Her style
 
is the simplest and most direct.  She always singi without accompaniment.
 
Charles Seeger, eminent UCLA musicologist participating in the festival,
 
called her style the most typical of the American tradition present at the
 
Festival.
 
Charleston News and Courier, 1964k:  Alan Lomax's description of the first
 
concert given by the Georgia Sea laland Singers to their own people:  An
 
audience of farmers and rural workers sat rapt in pleasure as the famous
 
Georgia Sea Island Singers performed the music of their great- gran
dp aren
ts .
 
An electric current of discovery ran through the hall, the thrill of a
 
people finding that they were carriers of a worthy tradition, that what they
 
knew was of interest iq to the whole wide world.
 
In an interview with Pat Watters of the Atlanta Journal and Constitution,
 
Bessie Jones says of her concert in Carnegie Hall:  Carnegie Hall was big-
ger than a hotel, all right.
 But there was nothing but heads out there,
 
That's all right with me; as long as they's peoples, I ain't afraid.  Long
 
as they don't change their faces.
 I know I
'm scared when a snake jumps.
 
Something like that.
 But people, that's all I know.

The Georaia Sea I

both performers and f

un.
 
There was no water c

rest of us and would s
top dead in the middle of an otherwise perfect
 
"
take", while the technicians cursed.  "Plane coming," John Davis would
 
announce l
aconically, and we would a
ll fall s
ilent; minutes later, i
t seemed,
 
we would hear the faint buzz appropching.
 
S
o i
t was l
ate in the day before the f
ilm crew got around to the
 
shots that Dr. Carpenter and I wanted, and we had to work fast, for the
 
Ug&tght was fading.  The three "takes" that make up the f
ilm "Buck Dancer"
 
are, in fact, a
ll that we were able to shoot.  Fortunately, it proved possible
 
to s
tring them together l
ater into a reasonably coherent s
tatement, but
 
this was due more to the vitality and consistency of Ed Young's tradition
 
than to any special foresight on our parts.
 
We had decided to concentrate on Ed Young, s
ince the previous summer
 
(
cf. the f
ilm, "The Georgia Sea I
sland Singers") we had f
ilmed a part of the
 
St. Simon's I
sland repertoire.  Mr. Young, although then resident in Memphis,
 
Tennessee, where he worked as a high school janitor, had been born and brought
 
up in the h
illylcountry of north-western Mississippi, just east of the delta
 
bottoms.  Add among the farming people of those l
ow hills has survived a
 
musical convention that can be dated back before the American Revolution-
-
-
the b
lack f
ife and drum band.
 
The transverse-blown f
ife (
often made of hollow reed) i
s an instru-
mental type older than B
iblical times, and there is much evidence that i
t was
 
known in African before the days of the s
lave trade.  Drums, of course, have
 
l
ong been a west African commonplace; thus, African musicians, transported to
 
this new country as s
laves during the 1
7th and 1
8th centurèes, found in the
 
military f
ife and drum c
orps of the colonists, a familiar instrumentarium.
 
There are many accounts of black fife and drum units during Revolutionary, a
s
 
well as l
ater Civil War, pimIdds.During the post-bellum period, these e
ssen-
t
ially military units gradually changed both focus and function, one of the
 
3
)
 
"
growths being the marching bands that s
till play the
 
'
rom the graveyard in some sections of the s
outhern b
lack
 
ty.
 
U
 
the c
orner of Mississippi that Ed Young grew up i
n, however,
 
w f
ife and drum band served another function; it was the main attraction
 
at l
ocal rural picnics.  Since Alan Lomax first recorded Ed Young's band
 
in 1
959, other s
imilar groups have been discovered in  the general area
 
by David Evans and o
thers; and i
t i
s becoming clearer that the Mèaats ippi
 
;
ountry picnic was -
-
 and s
till i
s, to a degree -
-
 an institution of real
 
s
tability and cultural importance.  Picnics are generally held on a Sa$drday
 
and attract black f
amilies from all around; even white politicians, sensing
 
the convenience of having so large a group of voters in one place, have begun
 
attending in recent years.  There is food and visiting, but the main attraction
 
i
s the band which p
lays, primarily for dancing, until midnight.  Ed told me,
 
"We s
tart out in the middle of a field and the grass i
s sometimes up to your
 
waist, and when we're through, i
t's a
ll gone.  They just dance i
t r
ight on
 
'
7 
down to the ground!"
 
Ed Young, l
ike many f
ife players, i
s h
imself an expert dancer,
 
and in this f
ilm he does a part of the "buck dance", a southern dance of solo
 
male virtuosity eggaged in by both black and white frontiersmen.  Indeed,
 
Ed's own dance s
tyle, according to Alan Lomax and Forrestine Paulay, of the
 
Caf
ltometrics Research project at Columbia University, i
s a combination of
 
African and European e
lements.  The relaxed f
loppy arms and subtle s
inuous
 
t
runk movements are African in provenience, along with the low dragging
 
f
oot moves.  However, the overall vertical s
tyle -
-
 the sense of dancing i
n
 
a confined space -
-
 i
s a feature found most frequently in western Europe,
 
a
s i
s the notion of f
loor sounding, or c
logging.
 
Thus both the music and the dance d
isplayed in this f
ilm can be
 
most accurately
 
4
)
 
most a
ccurately referred to as "Afro-American" -
-
 a new and creative
 
development, by black artists resident in the United S
tates, out of a
 
combination of o
ld world e
lements.  What i
s on the s
creen, however, s
hould
 
not be regarded as an accurate picture of the cultural reality.  Ed Young
 
should have been accompanied by his brothers' drums, rather than by the
 
Sea I
slander c
lapping (
though it should be noted that the unfamiliar com-
b
ination gave none of the participants any trouble at all, indicating
 
that they shared a common cultural underpinning).  The i
1ir
ni gcontext too,
 
in which the f
ife music would more normally be heard, was impossible to
 
create, and we didn't e
ven try.
 
Still, I am not s
orry that we made the f
ilm.  The fertile
 
culture of this small section of the United States gets a few minutes
 
exposure, and the artistry of that gentle .hisp of a man, Ed Young,
 
blowing his f
ife to the s
tars, is f
irmly demonstrated.  In f
ilm-making,
 
a
s i
n any o
ther anthropological e
ndeavor, you work with what' othezn.get.

.  Recorded by Alan Loma':,
 
This piece illustrates an older approach to fife and drun nusLc t
lr'a th
 
preceding one.  "After the Ball' i
omw composed by Charles K. Harris in lE',
 
remains a popular waltz in the repertoires of country string bands.  It-
we ei  in the black fife and drum tradition is a reflection of the origin o"
 
that tradition.  Military fiTe and drum music drew upon American popular song fer
 
its material as well as a repertoire of march tunes.  The four fife and
 
recorded by Sid Hemphill's band in 1942
 all reflect these sources.  Besiaa;
 t
'
 
piece presented here, the band recorded another popular song, "The Sidewalks o"
 
New York j) "Jesse James," a well known folksong performed mainly by whitest c'
 
a piece called "The Death March."  The last title indicates that Hemphill's b
-
might have played at funerals, although none of the current bands do and nobo
 
a the area can remember such a practice.  Hemphill was born in 1876, and his st'7'
 
drum is restricted to keeping time, while the snare drum; play practically in
 
unison and exhibit little improvisation and no syncopation.  The fife depart
 
little from Harris' published melody.  Since the turn of the century the bl
h
 
fife and drum music in this area has abandoned these characteristics, which ar'
 
more typical of white music, and become more syncopated and inn'ovi atioonl, no
 
exemplified in the preceding piece.  Older drummers to 'y can be

Sung, whistled, and played on the washtub by Compton Jones, with Mrs. Virgin
 
Mae Jones on "bow diddley," Willie B. Wren beating a chair, Dollie Mae and

Jones beating cans, and Annie Lee and Melvin Jones heating benches, near 5enatoh a,
 
c
 
Miss., July 6
, 1971.  Recorded by David1 Jnao ,
 
The style recorded here represents hone music in i
uitation of a fife vn(l dnun
 
band.  Compton Jones' whistling is the equivalent of the fife, while his washtub
 
roughly matches the bass drum.  The beating on cans, benches, and a chair actually
 
amounts to the equivalent of several snare drums.  The group consists of Ccnntos
 
Jones, his wife, their four children, and a nephew who lives next door.  They play
 
his kind of music in front of their house where the washtub is kept and where t
Jnn
 
several chairs and benches and a pile of wood scraps.  The chairs, benches, an -
are beaten either with sticks or the hands, while Jones stands holding t
i
 
'
ashtub in his left hand and striking it with his right thumb and fingers.  Mn

Dear Mr. Young,
 
I am writing you at the suggestion of David Evans of Fullerton, California,
 
who also gave me your address.  I need to get in touch with your father,
 
Ed Young.  The last I heard, he was l
iving in Nashville, Tennessee, but I
 
have lost his street address and none of my Nashville friends knows where
 
he is.
 
The reason I am anxious to reach your father is that almost ten years ago
 
my brother, Alan Lomax, and I were involved in making a short film of
 
Ed Young out here in California.  At the time, we couldn't interest
 
anybody in distributing the film, and I expect your father may have for-
gotten all about it by now.  However, recently an educational f
ilm company
 
has agreed to put the film out, and I need to get your father's agreement.
 
Any royalty money that may come in to the film company as the result of
 
sales or rentals of the film will be distributed between your father and
 
the Georgia Sea I
sland Singers, who were also in the movie, (
the people
 
like Alan and myself who worked on making the film will not be paid) and
 
I need to work out the details on this with your father also.  I do not
 
think there will be very much money, unfortunately; the film i
s very
 
short -
-
 only eight minutes -
-
 and will only be c
listrbuted to schools and
 
colleges; still, anything is better than nothing.  I have dealt with this
 
film company before, and they are honest people.
 
I am enclosing a stamped self-addressed envelope for your convenience.
 
Please just send me a note with your father's address, and his telephone
 
number, if he has one, as well.  And if you see him, please give him my
 
very best regards.  I
've heard that he has been very sick; I do hope he
 
is well and feeling better by now.
 
Yours truly,
 
Bess Lomax Hawes

Dear Sirs:
 
Ms. Cheri Hunter has permission to remove from your vaults for
 
examination, use and proper labelling all materials which may be
 
filed under the following titles:
 
Georgia Sea Island Singers
 
Buck Dancer
 
Yonder Comes Day

These materials may in turn be in vaults l

 In the past, we seem to have been unable
 
to get this situation totally under control; I an extremely hopeful
 
that Ms. Hunter will be able to organize, label and file all the
 
above footage properly.
 
Should you have any questions, please telephone me at 396-2982;

Dear Bess 1 
Received your letter of January 31 with regard to the
 
two educational films.
 
We are checking the titles you  listed to determine  if
 
these are in fact included in the repertory of titles
 
acquired from Bessie Jones.
 
For your guidance,  subsequent to her signing the agree—
 
ment 1 we learned that there were four or five titles in
 
the agreement which s
le  previously assigned to one of
 
the companies controlled by Hill and Range Music in New
 
York and since such agreement was prior to ours, we have
 
had to cede their rights to those titles.
 When you come
 
to New York, as you indicate, perhaps we can talk about
 
these.
 
In regard to your own educational film projects, please
 
know that we'll lend our fullest cooperation to make
 
possible your sale of these films to the distributor
 
and as soon as we determine if these titles are under
 
our control, we can then write you in greater details
 
f the procedures and suggest a fee that would be
 
t involved.
 
All gqod wishes,

Dear Art:
 
Alan just d
ropped me a note reminding me of a crucial i
ssue: t
he puestion
 
of c
learances and royalties f
or the two f
ilms, Buck D
ancer and G
eorgia Sea
  
I
sland Singers, o
r whatever you've named i
t. On the f
irst matter, I a
ssume
 
that Ted Carpenter got clearance f
orms s
igned by all the performers when
 
t
he f
ilms were shot, but I think i
t's an equally valid a
ssumption that l
i
e
 
has l
ost them by now, and I don't think i
t's worthwhile waiting until he
 
gets back f
rom New Guinea to a
sk him.  I suggest we start all over.
 
Personnel involved in the two f
ijjis (erforners, t

Thus far, I
 nope I
've raised no r
eal problems; however, there i
s a bit of a
 
sticker coming up.  John Davis (
who appears in both f
ilms) died last year,  ia
 
I
 have no idea whether or not he l
eft a will.  If he did, i
t would simplify
 
t
he problem in a
 way.  If he d
id not, I am sure the I
slanders would agree t
o
 
an equal d
ivision among the survivors, so t
o say; however, t
hat might leave
 
adim F

egally vulnerable i

I
