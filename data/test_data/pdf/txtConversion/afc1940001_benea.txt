Beneath the old oak tree

[?] BENEATH THE OLD OAK TREE (Betsy)O dark and stormy was the night and fast did fall the
rainWhen Betsy left her own dear home not to return again.She left her widowed mother's side,
not fearing storm or cold,For she was young and fair to view; but love had made her bold,And unto
James, her own true love, she'd promised for to beThat very night at ten o'clock beneath the old oak
tree.The night passed by, the morning came, and Betsy was not home;And much it grieved her friend
to know where this far maid did roam.The days passed by, she came not home. Her mother, nearly
wild,[Said]: "I'll hunt this kingdom over, but I'll find my darling child."The days went by for most a
month, and Betsy was not found,Until one day the Squire went out to hunt with all his hounds.And
up the hill and down the dale went the galliant company,Until by chance the fox was lost beneath
the old oak tree.The hounds stopped there and [scrached?] he ground, and loudly they did bay,
[????] And neither whip nor sharp command could drive those dogs away.The brave young men they
gathered round, they called for pick and spade,And there they dug, and there they found the dead
and missing maid.And who it was that did the deed, the truth seemed very plain,For O, the dagger
in her heart bore James McCulloch's name.I did the deed, the villain cried. The truth I will explain,
[md]For in an evil moment I had ruined Betsy's fame.She persevered, I tired grew, and as it seemed
to me,The devil whispered: Take her life then you will be free.For mercy now I do notask; you see
my guilt is plain.He drew a pistol from his belt and fired it through his brain.They buried him right
where he fell; no Christian grave got he,And none there were to bless the ground beneath the old
oak tree.The form should be like this: Two lines of the above to a verse [md]viz.,
O dark and stormy was the night,And fast did fall the rainWhen Betsy left her own dear home,Not
