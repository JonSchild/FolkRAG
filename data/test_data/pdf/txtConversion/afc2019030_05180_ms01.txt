And Mary, could you give your name and your birth date (for the record)? 
 
MB: 
Yes. Mary Burris; July 25th, 1974. 
 
LG: 
Okay, thank you. And you know you are being audio recorded? 
 
MB: 
Yes. 
 
LG: 
Okay. And we are here, in your office, at the University of Utah, at the University of 
Utah Neuropsychiatric Institute. And we’re talking about physician oral histories, and 
their work. 
 
 
So, if you could describe your medical background: where you went to school, residency, 
sort of the timeline of your training, please? 
 
MB: 
I went to undergraduate at the University of Nevada Las Vegas. And then for medical 
school, I went to the University of Nevada Reno. And then for residency, I went to the 
University of Utah, for psychiatric residency in general psychiatry. And then after that, I 
did two years of child and adolescent psychiatry fellowship at the University of Utah.  
 
LG: 
Okay; and what year did you enter medical school? 
 
MB: 
2000. 
 
LG: 
2000? 
 
MB: 
I graduated 2004, and then I started residency 2004. 
 
LG: 
Okay. And how about for the –  
 
MB: 
I’d have to do the math. 
 
[Laughter] 
 
 
So, that was three years of residency; I think I graduated from my fellowship in 2007, if I 
have the math right. I’ll have to look; I don’t remember the exact years. It’s been a long 
time. 
 
LG: 
Okay. 
 
MB: 
But 2004 is when I started, so it’s [counting to self-] five, six, ’07 is when I started my 
fellowship, I guess; then 2009 is when I finished my fellowship. 
 
LG: 
Okay. And then what kinds of employment have you had since your fellowship? 
 
Physician Oral History: Mary Burris 
Page 3 
MB: 
After fellowship, I began work at the Utah State Hospital, on the children’s unit. And I 
was there for five years. And then I left there and came back to the University of Utah; 
and I currently work as an in-patient child-adolescent psychiatrist at the Neuropsychiatric 
Institute. 
 
LG: 
Okay. Can you talk a little bit about your job? Your current job, and what your duties 
are? 
 
MB: 
So, I’m an in-patient physician. We have kind of a – it’s kind of seen as a hospitalist type 
of job. So, I see children from age (technically zero) to 17; but we don’t take kids that 
young here. So, really around five to age 17, sometimes 18-year-olds (if they’re still 
living at home and going to high school).  
 
 
And I treat kids who are in acute crisis. So, they’re coming for aggression, they’re 
coming in for harming others, they’re coming in for suicidal thoughts, they’re coming in 
for suicide attempts.  
 
 
Sometimes they come in for inability to function; for instance, unable to take care of 
themselves: eating, drinking, not going to school – not like refusing every once in a 
while, but like six months of not being able to leave the house to go to school – like that 
kind of non-functioning. 
 
[03:30] 
 
 
And they usually come through the ER first, and then they come in here. And then I 
assess their diagnoses, I look at medications (if they’re indicated). We work with the 
families on safety plans before they leave, and we help with the next level of care, after 
the in-patient unit.  
 
 
And they’re usually here about – each kid is here about seven to ten days. So, we have a 
big turn-around; so, I see lots of different patients every, single week. 
 
 
I’m on service seeing patients for about four to six weeks, and then I’m off service for 
one to two weeks, where I don’t see patients.  
 
 
 
I also have the added role as an associate training director for the general psychiatry 
residency. And so, when I’m off service a lot of my time is dedicated to that.  
 
LG: 
Can you talk about that a little bit? 
 
MB: 
Sure. So, there’s a program director, and I’m kind of the assistant to that director; and 
there’s three of us – I’m one of three. And my main job is to help with interviewing 
potential residents – that’s coming up right now, actually, in the fall.  
 
Physician Oral History: Mary Burris 
Page 4 
 
So, these are medical students who are graduating their medical schools, and they’re 
looking to start a psychiatric residency. And I help with the interview process, screening, 
who gets interviewed, and then the rank list (which decides who gets into our program). 
 
 
I also am in charge of the didactics for the current residents. And each resident class 
(there are four classes: PGY 1, 2, 3, and 4) – each class has their own didactic schedule 
for the entire year. And I get to put all that together: who is giving the lectures, what kind 
of lectures, when they happen. And their lectures are every Wednesday from 9 am to 4 
pm – so, that’s a lot of lectures that I’m scheduling [laughs]. 
 
LG: 
That is a lot of lectures.  
 
MB: 
Yeah, it’s a lot of lectures.  
 
LG: 
[Laughs] 
 
MB: 
So, yeah – so, that’s my main duty – those are my main duties with that.  
 
 
Also, though, I’m a mentor to some of the residents. If they’re struggling, if they need 
extra support, or they have questions about things I’ll meet with them and help them 
through whatever they’re struggling with, or what they need help with. 
 
LG: 
Is that a formal mentorship, or just informal? 
 
MB: 
Both. Some just come to my office, just randomly, and ask for you know, assistance with 
this, that, or the other thing; some are struggling to the point they need a formal mentor 
and that’s actually on the books, and maybe they need some remediation about 
something. And I actually have to keep track, formally, what’s going on with them. 
 
[06:15] 
 
LG: 
What kind of things do residents struggle with? 
 
MB: 
Oh, all sorts of things (because they’re human); so, they have personal things that go on 
in their lives: divorces, deaths in families that impact their ability to work, so they need 
to, you know, take a leave of absence. We have to help them get into their own therapy.  
 
 
You know, pregnancies – so then they need time off, and then we have to help them 
figure out, do they need to make make-up time, or not make up time and how that’s all 
going to look. They need to go down to half-time, and how that’s going to look.  
 
 
Other times, it’s clinically they struggle, – they just don’t have the knowledge base that 
they need to do well in their rotations, and the attendings give us feedback that they 
aren’t doing well; so, we have to remediate a little bit and maybe give them extra study 
help. 
 
Physician Oral History: Mary Burris 
Page 5 
 
All sorts of things; yeah.  
 
LG: 
How did you decide to become a doctor? 
 
MB: 
Well I am not one of those people that wanted to be a doctor since I was five years old. 
I’m just not one of those—that’s the typical story, “I always wanted to be a doctor when I 
was a kid,” and you know, “it was my dream.” And no – that was not my dream. I 
actually wanted to go into music: I wanted to compose music or be a choir director. So, 
yeah [laughs]. 
 
 
So, in college my major was actually music composition. And I realized pretty early on 
that I had the ability to do that job, but I didn’t have the natural talent to do that job. And 
the people – my cohort in that field – they had talent, and they were going to get all of the 
jobs [laughs]. And that was pretty clear to me [laughing]. 
 
 
 
My other love was science. I loved science, so I switched my major to biology, with a 
chemistry minor. And then I didn’t know what I was really going to do with that. I 
thought maybe I would teach, or I didn’t really know what I was going to do with that.  
 
 
And what changed my life was I was able to get a volunteer position at the Las Vegas 
medical examiner’s office. And so, I started working there and I started – there’s a term 
for what I did, it’s a “diener” [laughs] –  
 
[08:47] 
 
LG: 
A diener? 
 
MB: 
That’s what they called them, yeah. Basically, an autopsy technician, is the new, 
politically correct way to call it. 
 
 
So, I did autopsies. I removed the organs and gave them to the pathologist, and he would 
slice them and put them on slides. And so I did that for a couple years – volunteer basis. 
And I thought, “Okay, I found my career – I’m going to be this autopsy technician,” 
[laughing] so that was going to be my job.  
 
 
And I was waiting for a position to open so I could apply. And that was going to be my 
job. I also worked at a mortician’s office for a little while and embalmed (also for free, 
volunteer). I was really into it. So, yeah – I still love it, to this day. 
 
 
Then I thought, “Oh, maybe I should be a pathologist,” you know? And so I asked them, 
“How do I become what you do?” And he said, “Well you have to go to medical school.” 
And I had no idea what that entailed, and I thought, “Okay, well I guess I’ll just go to 
medical school then.”  
 
[Laughter] 
 
Physician Oral History: Mary Burris 
Page 6 
 
No big deal. Clearly, I was naïve at the time. He talked about residencies and fellowships, 
and that went right over my head – I had no idea what he was talking about. I thought it 
was like a club, like a “fellow-ship” is like a club – like I didn’t realize what that meant, 
in terms of training.  
 
 
So, I started researching how to get into medical school. And I did all the things, I 
checked all the boxes, I took all the classes I needed to take, I took the MCAT. And I 
applied to medical school. And it was very tough. I didn’t realize how hard it was to get 
into medical school. I ended up going to the medical school in my state, which was 
actually the best decision, I think, because of the tuition (it was in-state tuition). And so, 
my loans weren’t quite as crazy. So, that’s my getting into medical school story.  
 
[10:46] 
 
 
And then once I got into medical school, also I was not prepared for how difficult that 
was going to be. I didn’t have very good study skills, and so I kind of quickly had to learn 
how to be a medical student. And then in my second year, I took pathology (as we all do), 
and realized I do not like pathology [laughs]. 
 
LG: 
Why? 
 
MB: 
Well because it’s not interesting stories about how a person died. Pathology has this 
whole other section, which is looking at slides, and you know, diagnosing cancer, and 
looking at pathology slides from surgeries. Forensic pathology (which is my area of 
interest) was a very, very small piece of what pathology actually is.  
 
 
And I didn’t like looking at slides. I looked at these slides and I was just kind of like, 
“Oh, great; another pinkish-purple blob.” 
 
[Laughter] 
 
 
It was boring for me, to be honest. And I learned that what I liked about forensic 
pathology was not actually the pathology part. It was reading the police notes about how 
they found the body, and how the homicide came to be, you know? The blood splatters – 
it was the forensic part of forensic pathology, not the pathology part. 
 
 
And so, I had kind of a crisis, because the whole reason why I went to medical school 
was to be a forensic pathologist, and now that’s not what I wanted to do. And so, and I 
already had student loans; so, I kind of had to rethink all of this. And I thought for a 
minute about dropping out, because I didn’t know what I wanted to do otherwise.  
 
LG: 
This was second year? 
 
MB: 
Second year, yep. And everyone just kept saying, “No, stick with it; third year is going to 
be better. Hang in there, third year is when you start your clinical work.” 
 
Physician Oral History: Mary Burris 
Page 7 
 
I said, “Oh, okay; so, now I have to like see alive people? And am I going to like that?” 
 
[12:49] 
 
 
So, third year came and you do all your rotations, so internal medicine, family medicine, 
pediatrics, psychiatry, you know, neurology – all the things. And I loved all of it. So, then 
I had a different kind of crisis, because every rotation I went on, “Oh, this is what I’m 
going to be. I’m going to be an internal medicine doctor. I’m going to be a surgeon. I’m 
going to be an ob/gyn.” So, I fell in love with everything – which is a good problem –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MB: 
I suppose, to have. So, by that point I was thinking, “Okay, I’m going to finish this 
medical school thing, but now I’ve got to figure out what I want to be.” And I really 
thought I was going to be ob/gyn. But I really only liked normal, spontaneous, vaginal 
deliveries, and that’s it. I didn’t like the surgical part of it, and so my mentor (at the time) 
said, “Well you really want to be a midwife then.”  
 
[Laughter] 
 
 
And so, then I was like, “Yeah, I guess you’re right.” So, anyway – so, I went through all 
the things and then in fourth year, at the beginning of my fourth year I really liked 
neurology. I finally honed in on I’m going to be a neurologist; I really like stroke, and 
working in the neuro ICU. I actually got letters from neurologists for my applications, I 
applied to neurology. I was decided – it was actually between neurology and psychiatry, 
and I decided neurology was it. 
 
 
So, I applied, I started getting interviews for neurology, and then I, at the last minute 
decided, “No, this doesn’t feel right.” And I went to psychiatry at the very last minute. I 
had to pull my application, resubmit; I had to find new letters. Yeah, but it worked out. 
And I got interviews, and I got my first choice of where I wanted to go, which is the 
University of Utah. So, it all worked out in the end. 
 
LG: 
Why did you decide that psychiatry was it? 
 
MB: 
Well I think always knew psychiatry was it, I just wasn’t allowing myself to embrace it. 
Because being a psychiatrist kind of feels (to other people) that you’re not a real doctor. 
Like you went through all of medicine to not do medicine, if you will.  
 
[15:07] 
 
 
And so, once I kind of got over that it was a very clear path to me. So, I think it was that 
kind of stigma and barrier that I had to get over.  
 
LG: 
So, you were getting that message as a medical student? 
 
Physician Oral History: Mary Burris 
Page 8 
MB: 
Oh, yeah; it’s everywhere – from my family: like, “Why did you go to medical school 
just to be a psychiatrist?” Oh yeah, my own family said it. 
 
LG: 
Can you talk about that a little bit? 
 
MB: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
The stigma around psychiatry? 
 
MB: 
Yeah, I mean it’s just not viewed as a real medical field. I think it’s getting better, and I 
think part of it, it’s getting better because our research is getting more robust. Our 
research is becoming more and more biological. We have more and more imaging that 
we’re doing, and so it just feels more medical and science-based you know, compared to 
just talking to people. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MB: 
I feel like our medications are becoming a little more streamlined and focused than it 
used to be. But it’s still there – it’s still there that you’re not sort of a real doctor, because 
you’re not like listening to hearts all the time and getting blood work. You know what I 
mean?  
 
 
We are getting blood work, but it’s mostly, unfortunately, because of the side effects of 
our medications, is why we’re getting blood work. Although sometimes people come in 
psychotic and we don’t know why they’re psychotic. And it isn’t necessarily 
schizophrenia, so we have to work them up medically to figure it out. 
 
 
So, yeah – it was a hard decision. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MB: 
I’m fine with it now (obviously), but back when you’re in medical school you feel like 
you’re kind of giving up something.  
 
LG: 
Interesting. 
 
MB: 
You’re kind of giving up all of your medical training a little bit. But you’re not. The 
bottom line is you’re not, but you just don’t know that at the time. 
 
LG: 
So, what are some of the – I know that medical specialties tend to have stereotypes –  
 
MB: 
Um-hmm. 
 
LG: 
What, from a psychiatric point of view, are the stereotypes about that particular specialty, 
about psychiatry? 
 
Physician Oral History: Mary Burris 
Page 9 
[17:01] 
 
MB: 
About psychiatry? That’s a good question. I think one of the stereotypes is that we don’t 
know how to do medicine. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
MB: 
So, like if someone has a medical emergency, we don’t handle it – we have “real doctors” 
(if you will) take care of it, which isn’t the case. But that’s a stereotype. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MB: 
We handle all sorts of medical emergencies here, and we know how to handle it, and we 
handle it well, actually. And we have ongoing training – because it’s not something we 
deal with every, single day like some specialties (like ER), you know? 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MB: 
So, we do just have ongoing training, so we’re ready to go when it does happen. And I 
would even say because of that, we might be even better at it, because we get the 
specialized training. But that’s another issue. 
 
 
What else? I can’t think of anything off the top of my head right now. I mean, there’s like 
[laughs] – there are some, you know, there’s jokes that go along with it like, “How many 
psychiatrists does it take to change a light bulb?”  
 
 
“Depends if the lightbulb wants to change.” 
 
[Laughter] 
 
 
Stuff like that, you know what I mean? 
 
LG: 
I was just wondering if it stemmed from like Freud, or you know? 
 
MB: 
No –  
 
LG: 
Like historical [??] –  
 
MB: 
Not that I’m aware of; no, not that I’m aware of. It’s mostly just that we’re not always 
perceived as real doctors. I think that’s the biggest thing. 
 
 
However, I do have to say though, when other specialties like ER, or internal medicine, 
or family doctors, or pediatricians have psychiatric patients they are quick to call us. 
Because they’re not always prepared to treat those patients; they don’t get the same 
training at all. 
 
Physician Oral History: Mary Burris 
Page 10 
LG: 
Right; yeah, I’m sure. 
 
MB: 
Yeah. So, we get called right away to take care of those patients.  
 
LG: 
So, let’s talk a little bit about your training – what was the hardest thing about medical 
school? Most people don’t go to medical school, so can you talk about what it was like to 
go through that kind of training? 
 
MB: 
Yeah, yeah. Well it’s broken up into two areas: one area is the in-class training, and that’s 
where you just go to classes, and you go to lectures and take notes, and take tests. And 
you have to take, you know, steps, the board exams, step one, step two, step three. And 
the steps are coordinated with what level of training you’re in. 
 
 
There were a lot of hard parts. I think one of the hardest parts was (for me) was just the 
in-class training, it’s just a lot of material: very, very you know, hard material and a lot of 
it, and tests are hard.  
 
 
And you are kind of pitted against your classmates – you’re kind of scrabbling to be at 
the top, because you know the top people are going to get into the residencies that they 
want. And when you first get there, you’re not sure what specialty you’re even going 
into. So, you want to be the best you can possibly be, because there’s a potential that 
you’re going to pick a specialty that’s going to be very competitive to get into. 
 
[20:26] 
 
 
So, from the very beginning – even before medical school – you’re constantly trying to 
be better than your colleagues. And it’s unhealthy, I feel like. And I feel like that medical 
schools today are doing less of that. I think it’s more supportive now, and they’re trying 
to make it a little less that you’re competing against each other, but it’s still there.  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MB: 
I mean, you just can’t help it. So, it’s very competitive, it’s a lot of information coming 
very fast. And like I said, I don’t think I was prepared to study for all of that. Schooling 
kind of came to me fairly easy in high school and undergrad, and it didn’t prepare me – 
so, I didn’t really learn how to study very well. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MB: 
And so, by the time I got to medical school, it was a whole other level. And so, that was 
very difficult. You know, falling out of love with pathology was very difficult, so there 
was kind of that personal crisis I kind of went through with that; that was very difficult. I 
talked to a lot of mentors during that time.  
 
Physician Oral History: Mary Burris 
Page 11 
 
I think some of the techniques of how the teachers taught was difficult. Some of them 
purposefully tried to make you feel dumb during the class – they kind of call you out on 
stuff. 
 
LG: 
Can you give an example? 
 
MB: 
Yeah, I can’t give a specific example, but like one person I worked with, he was a 
teacher, and he was a PhD; and he liked to call all of us “doctor” (so, “Dr. Burris”). And 
he would say, “Dr. Burris!” And he would just call you out in front of the whole class.  
 
 
And he would actually ask questions until you could no longer answer. Sort of 
purposefully embarrassing you in front of your class. And in some cases, it would be one 
question in you [laughing] couldn’t answer. And in other cases, it would be maybe four 
questions in; it just depended on when he asked, you know?  
 
 
And then if you didn’t get it right he would say things like, “Dr. Burris needs to hit the 
books.” Or you know, or whatever; but it wasn’t just me – it was everybody. So, I guess 
we were all in the same pain together. So, it was helpful, actually, because he didn’t 
discriminate: he went after everybody. 
 
[Laughter] 
 
 
But that was hard. It was hard, it was embarrassing you know? And some of us forget our 
own name when we were called, let alone knowing what the slide was he was showing.  
 
LG: 
Yeah. 
 
[23:13] 
 
MB: 
But the flip side of that is that particular professor ended up being a favorite of 
everybody’s, too; because he did have a very warm side that he didn’t show in class – it 
was something you could only see when you met with him one-on-one. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MB: 
So, yeah – so, he ended up being a favorite – also of mine, even though it was very 
painful [laughs]. 
 
 
The other painful part of medical school, I guess, would be the third and fourth years, 
during your clinical years. It depended – again, it was very attending-dependent. In 
surgery – I think surgery is sort of notorious for this, they can be very mean. They’re 
yelling at the students, they’re yelling at the nurses in the OR.  
 
 
I remember one physician asking me and the other medical student who was in the OR to 
sit in the corner of the room during the entire three-hour surgery. And he just peppered us 
with questions about the surgery that we can’t watch, that we couldn’t see. 
Physician Oral History: Mary Burris 
Page 12 
 
LG: 
Wow. 
 
MB: 
Yeah, it was awful [laughs]. Yeah, and of course we didn’t know any answers, we didn’t 
know what he was doing, you know? And he was sort of notorious for that, so we kind of 
knew it going in. But it didn’t feel good.  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MB: 
I’ve had surgical equipment thrown across the room – not towards me, but just thrown 
because the surgeon was upset about something. Berating and belittling the scrub nurses, 
who maybe grabbed the wrong instrument. Yeah, it was tough. It was very – every time 
you went into an OR with certain surgeon, you would feel nervous because you wouldn’t 
know how it was going to go. 
 
LG: 
What about the workload and schedule during the clinical years? 
 
MB: 
It was, well, it was hard at the time; but in hindsight, it wasn’t that bad –  
 
[Laughter] 
 
[25:15] 
 
 
Because residency was so much worse. So, it’s hard to say at this point, because I’ve 
already lived everything. At the time, it was pretty busy; some specialties were busier 
than others. So, like surgery and ob/gyn were super busy; whereas, psychiatry, you know, 
and derm, and neuro and things like that were not quite as busy. But we’d be up all night 
with the residents and taking new admissions and working them up, and typing them up. 
It was pretty busy. But we weren’t as busy as the residents. 
 
LG: 
Can you talk a little bit about your residency? 
 
MB: 
Yeah, yeah. It was excellent. I feel like I got a very good training. The intern year (which 
is year one) was very busy. You’re just up all night. And they way psychiatry works is 
they split it up: half the year is internal medicine and neurology, in-patient, and a little bit 
of out-patient; and then the other part of the year is psychiatry, in-patient. 
 
 
And the hardest part of the year was actually in-patient internal medicine. They treated 
you just like they did their own interns. And so, you’re on-call every third or fourth night, 
and up all night, and working up new patients. And then super early in the morning 
you’re rounding on your patients, and you round as a big team. 
 
 
And you have to present your patients and have a treatment plan ready. It was just very, 
very busy. And I think I especially thought it was difficult because I had a six-month-old 
baby at the time, and I was still nursing. And I remember nursing in the call room – not 
Physician Oral History: Mary Burris 
Page 13 
nursing, but pumping in the call room in the middle of the night, as I’m typing up my you 
know, new work-ups and stuff. It was brutal.  
 
[27:14] 
 
LG: 
Can you describe call a little bit for people who don’t know what that means? 
 
MB: 
Yeah. So, usually it means you’re on-call from (I don’t know) like five pm, to like maybe 
eight am the next morning. And you are cross-covering (which means you are covering 
the patients that are already in the hospital) for your colleagues who are not on-call. So, if 
things happen in the night with their patients, you have to take care of it – either do 
orders, or see them, or move them to different units (if there’s something going on).  
 
 
And then you’re also working up new admissions that are coming through the ER. And 
you’re on, typically, with a senior resident. And so, you’re just running around the 
hospital all night long. You sit down for like ten minutes and your pager goes off.  
 
 
And you kind of have this belt of pagers across your belly; one is your own pager, one is 
the cross-cover pager, one is the code (the dreaded code) pager – the code pager is the 
one that goes off when someone is having like a heart attack, and you have to run and do 
the code. You don’t want that one to go off, ever. And then you have an admission pager. 
So, I literally had like four pagers across my belt of my scrubs – and they’re all going off 
at different times, about different things.  
 
 
And so, sometimes you have to be at three places at once. And so, every once in a while, 
you’d have to, you know, call the other intern who was on at the same time, saying, 
“Hey, I’ve got to be here, can you go over and do this for me?” And you know, vice 
versa: they call you if they need extra help, or whatever.  
 
 
So, it’s just super busy. You learn a ton. I mean, you’re seeing all sorts of things that 
come in, and you don’t know what’s coming in when they’re coming in. So, you just 
learn a ton. And it’s a little trial by fire, you know? 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MB: 
But sometimes that is the best way to learn. 
 
[29:15] 
 
 
We had residency work hours that started around that time, so you couldn’t go over 80 
hours per week. So, [laughs] –  
 
LG: 
So, to non-medical people that sounds like an incredible amount of work – 80 hours a 
week. 
 
Physician Oral History: Mary Burris 
Page 14 
MB: 
It is an incredible amount of work, yeah. And we always met those 80 hours; I mean, we 
went right up to the – bumped right up to that 80, for sure.  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MB: 
Yeah, I found out how – I mean, this may be an urban legend, I’m not quite sure – but I 
heard that they came up with 80 because the average person (in the world, you know) 
would work full-time would be 40 hours a week, and a doctor’s not an average person, so 
they just doubled it. 
 
[Laughter] 
 
 
And that’s how they came up with 80 [laughs]. 
 
LG: 
That sounds like folklore. 
 
[Laughter] 
 
MB: 
[Laughing] Sounds like folklore. 
 
LG: 
It does – it sounds like folklore. 
 
MB: 
But still – I kind of wonder (to this day) like how did they come up with 80? That’s such 
a – why 80? 
 
LG: 
I don’t know. 
 
MB: 
And it still stands: 80 is still the work limit. 
 
LG: 
Yeah. So, how did you handle that kind of work load, particularly in residency? Both 
emotionally and physically? 
 
MB: 
Yeah; I’m not sure because you don’t really have an option. You just sort of brute 
strength through it – is what I did. And I did a lot of sleeping when I wasn’t on-call. I did 
a lot of taking my child to parks and trying to make the most of my quality time with her.  
 
 
When I did have vacation time, we often did staycations, because if we left it would just 
be more stress – it’s not exactly relaxing sometimes to leave. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MB: 
So, we’d just do staycations, skied.  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
Physician Oral History: Mary Burris 
Page 15 
MB: 
We have the best skiing in the world here, so I did a little bit of skiing; friends – hanging 
out with friends, you know. 
 
[31:18] 
 
LG: 
Did you feel like you could talk to anybody about what was going on in residency, about 
your experiences? 
 
MB: 
Yes. I could talk to the people that were in my class going through the same thing. It’s 
almost a little like – it’s kind of like being in the trenches together, you know what I 
mean? Because we were all going through it at the same time.  
 
 
I had a harder time talking to my superiors about it, because they (of course) had it much 
worse, and they had to walk uphill in snow both ways, kind of – you know what I mean? 
So, they didn’t always appreciate it and they kind of took it as complaints, instead of us 
just expressing how hard it is.  
 
 
So, I’d say with my cohort I could definitely talk about it, but not the attendings, so 
much. 
 
LG: 
What about your family or friends? 
 
MB: 
Oh, yeah; yeah, I felt like I could talk about it with them. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
MB: 
Not in detail, because I don’t think they – they don’t really know what it’s truly like, you 
know? Unless you’ve actually gone through it, it’s kind of hard to describe. So –  
 
LG: 
Okay. 
 
MB: 
And I also can’t – I certainly couldn’t talk about patients –  
 
LG: 
Right. 
 
MB: 
You know, because that’s protected information. So, yeah. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm, um-hmm.  
 
 
How do you think going through medical school, and residency, and eventually 
fellowship changed you as a person? 
 
MB: 
Um-hmm. That’s a good question. Well I think the obvious part is just knowledge base. I 
just feel like I have, you know, mountains of more information than what I had when I 
first started – but I think that just goes with the process of learning in general. 
 
Physician Oral History: Mary Burris 
Page 16 
[33:14] 
 
 
I feel like I definitely have a different view of doctors compared to when I first started. I 
didn’t really understand what a doctor was, you know, until I started learning what it was 
and living it.  
 
 
It’s a hard job. There’s a lot of responsibility and a lot of assumptions people make, and –  
 
LG: 
Can you talk about that a little bit? 
 
MB: 
Yeah, sure. Well it’s a hard job because we have a lot of responsibility. We have 
responsibility to care for patients: make sure they are healthy, make sure they’re not 
dying – and that’s heavy. And sometimes if, you know, negative things happen we are at 
fault, even though maybe we are not at fault.  
 
LG: 
What do you mean? 
 
MB: 
Well perception in the community – they put a lot of fault on doctors if bad things happen 
during clinical care, but they don’t really understand the details of what goes into medical 
decision-making, or even the pathological process at hand.  
 
 
They don’t have the information to really understand why this person became more ill, or 
why this person ended up dying, you know, under this doctor’s care.  
 
LG: 
is it possible to give an example? 
 
MB: 
Maybe, let me think. I don’t know, like diabetic care, you know? Doctors do all they can 
to educate their patients about diabetes and what could happen long-term. And you know, 
if they don’t take care of it they might get infections that can’t heal and might lose fingers 
or toes, or limbs even, you know? They could have a heart attack and you know, die. All 
of these things.  
 
 
They try to educate their patients, but then when things go awry and they lose a foot, or 
you know, something awful happens – I don’t think always that the general population 
understands the details of diabetes, and what goes into that, and non-compliance; and 
they kind of blame the doctor for not doing enough. 
 
[35:26] 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm, hmm. 
 
MB: 
I think that’s one example. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
- 
Physician Oral History: Mary Burris 
Page 17 
MB: 
In psychiatry it’s also very difficult because we have kids that come in who are suicidal, 
and we try to diagnose them appropriately, and give them medications they need, therapy 
that they need; but sometimes they still commit suicide. It’s just a fact. But then they 
blame the doctor for maybe not doing enough. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm; that sounds really hard. 
 
MB: 
It is hard; it’s really hard, especially in my field (I feel). I think any death is hard, but I’m 
dealing with children who are taking their own lives. It’s very heavy. 
 
LG: 
Yeah. 
 
MB: 
So, yeah; so, I mean that’s definitely changed me: just the weight of that responsibility, 
and then maybe the general public not fully understanding the nuances that go into all of 
this. It’s just very easy to blame the one who they see as like the top of the pecking order, 
you know what I mean? It’s hard. 
 
 
And we are doing our best to educate people about this. I think that’s one of the newer 
things in the last (maybe) 5-10 years, is more and more education, so people have a better 
understanding of medicine and what really goes into it. 
 
LG: 
And how do you handle that weight? 
 
MB: 
Um-hmm. 
 
LG: 
That responsibility? Because that is a very different kind of responsibility, in terms of 
work, than other professions have.  
 
MB: 
Um-hmm, yeah. It was hard at first. I didn’t know how to handle it at first, so it would 
weight on me, I would think about it at my house, you know, when I wasn’t working. I 
would dream about it, I would ruminate about “What could I have done differently?”  
 
 
And then over time, you just sort of learn to sort of let it go after you leave work. Even 
though it sounds cold, there is some hardening that sort of happens over time, where you 
just have to let things go and not ruminate about the negative things or the darker things.  
 
[37:37] 
 
 
So, self-care is huge in that – I know it’s kind of a catch phrase these days, “self-care.” 
But what I mean by that is go out with your friends, or hang out with your family, or 
exercise and you know, just try to live a normal life outside of medicine.  
 
 
I also, for me (personally), and I know this is sort of a taboo thing, honestly, is I don’t 
feel like I’m a doctor when I’m not at work. So, most doctors are doctors in their hearts, 
everywhere they go, they’re a doctor when they’re picking up their kids from school; 
Physician Oral History: Mary Burris 
Page 18 
they’re a doctor when, you know, they’re getting their teeth cleaned. They’re always 
doctors.  
 
 
And for me, it’s not my identity and it’s more of my job. 
 
LG: 
But you think that’s an anomaly? 
 
MB: 
I feel like it is, yeah. I feel like it is. You have to ask other doctors [laughs] about that. 
 
LG: 
Put it in my question base [laughs]. 
 
MB: 
Yeah, yeah. So, we wear lots of hats; I mean, just because we’re doctors – we’re also 
mothers, and wives, and you know, sisters, and cousins, and grandchildren – I mean, we 
have lots and lots of hats. And I just don’t feel like doctor is my hat all the time. Do I put 
it on when I’m not at work? Yes.  
 
 
So, for instance, I’ve been in places where people lose consciousness right in front of me 
and they fall on the ground, and I’m in a public space (like at a restaurant or something), 
and yes – I put on my doctor hat and I help that person. So, I guess it’s always there – it’s 
not like I take it off permanently.  
 
 
But if I’m out and about I don’t introduce myself as Dr., or whatever. I don’t say, “Oh, 
I’m Mary Burris; I’m a doctor.” I don’t do that.  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MB: 
As a matter of fact, when people ask me what I do – like if I’m on a plane or something – 
I often don’t tell them that I’m a doctor. 
 
[39:38] 
 
LG: 
Why? 
 
MB: 
Because it – they either launch into like, “Look at this thing on my arm, is it cancerous?” 
[Laughs] And then I’m like, “I’m a psychiatrist, I don’t really want to look at the thing on 
your arm.” Even if I wasn’t a psychiatrist, I really don’t want to look at the thing on your 
arm, you know?  
 
 
Or they launch into, “What’s it like being a doctor?” Kind of like this interview [laughs], 
you know? But you don’t want to do that when you’re on an airplane, and going on 
vacation, you know? 
 
LG: 
Yeah. 
 
MB: 
You don’t want to talk about how you became a doctor and how you like your job. And 
once they find out I’m a psychiatrist, then they launch into, “Oh, my cousin – she’s got—
Physician Oral History: Mary Burris 
Page 19 
she’s mentally ill.” And you know, you get to hear their stories; and frankly, I need a 
break from that when I’m not at work. 
 
LG: 
Yeah, of course. 
 
MB: 
And so, I will say I’m a teacher – which is not a lie– it’s true: I teach. I teach residents, I 
teach medical students – I tell them I’m a teacher.  
 
LG: 
That’s funny. 
 
MB: 
Yeah, and I come from a long line of teachers, so I’m very familiar with the lingo that 
goes along with being a teacher. And so, yeah –  
 
LG: 
That’s funny. 
 
MB: 
I feel kind of bad about that, but I just need a break from it. 
 
LG: 
Well that’s funny because one of my questions is how do people treat you when they 
learn that you’re a physician? 
 
MB: 
Um-hmm. 
 
LG: 
Apart from asking stories – do you notice –  
 
MB: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
Sort of a difference? 
 
MB: 
Yeah. I would say I get first, “OH, you’re a doctor.” Then they start calling me “doctor” 
sometimes: “Well doctor, what do you think about,” even though that’s not the 
relationship we have at the moment.  
 
 
They ask me about my training. They ask, “Have you seen this, have you seen that? Have 
you seen that?” You know, they start asking those kind of things.  
 
 
And then (again), once they find out I’m a psychiatrist, I either hear their own personal 
family stories about mental illness – which has two sides to it. There’s the side that’s kind 
of like, “I don’t want to think about my work kind of stuff right now, and hear your 
story.” But the other side of it is I’ve heard some really touching, amazing stories from 
people – just sitting in the airport, waiting for my plane.  
 
[41:58] 
 
 
And I really like those stories, because in my particular work with in-patient, I treat them 
for the acute problem and then they leave. And I often don’t know how their stories turn 
out or how they unfold. So, whether it’s a success story or not – I don’t normally hear.  
Physician Oral History: Mary Burris 
Page 20 
 
 
So, when I’m sitting in the airport and someone is telling me their story about their son 
who has bipolar disorder. And they tell me all the wonderful doctors they’ve had and how 
they’re doing so much better – I love hearing those stories, because we don’t hear those 
stories very often. So, that’s the benefit of it.  
 
 
So, but I have to allow myself to be open to all the conversations [laughs]: the good, bad, 
and the ugly –  
 
LG: 
Right. 
 
MB: 
To get to the good. 
 
LG: 
Right. 
 
MB: 
[Laughing] So, yeah – so, they do treat me a little differently. 
 
LG: 
So, as a female – switching gears just a little bit. 
 
MB: 
Um-hmm? 
 
LG: 
Were there any barriers that you felt you had to overcome? 
 
MB: 
Yes. Let me think about that a second.  
 
[Short banter between interviewee and interviewer regarding something happening in their 
immediate environment.] 
 
 
It is sort of a men’s world (medicine is). I think it’s gotten better. My medical school 
class was 50-50 male-female. And I think they do that on purpose. And it was nice to 
have that 50-50 mix.  
 
 
I think where I felt it the most was having kids. So, the men in my medical school class – 
they had children during medical school, but they could continue coming to school the 
whole time. There was not a huge upheaval of their life so much, because their wives had 
the baby and stayed home with the baby.  
 
[44:05] 
 
 
I was pregnant with my first one in my fourth year of medical school. And I did all my 
rotations – and as a matter of fact, I had her the day after the last day of one of my 
rotations [laughs]. I mean, it was like unbelievable timing [laughs].  
 
 
And I had my maternity leave planned for that day. I couldn’t even believe it happened 
that way; it doesn’t normally happen that way: babies come whenever they’re going to 
come. I just happened to be lucky.  
Physician Oral History: Mary Burris 
Page 21 
 
 
But I had to take maternity leave. And so, I had to get creative. And I ended up doing like 
a self-study research thing, where I had to read a bunch of journal articles and write it up 
as a paper. So, I did that while I was nursing a newborn and taking care of my first child. 
And that was hard.  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MB: 
It was really hard. I would have preferred just have that time off, and not have to work on 
a journal article thing [laughs]. But that wasn’t a thing back then. So, that was hard. 
 
LG: 
And that was what year? 
 
MB: 
My fourth year – so, she was born in December 2003, that’s when she was born. 
 
LG: 
Okay. 
 
MB: 
And then I graduated that June or May/June of 2004. 
 
LG: 
2004? 
 
MB: 
Um-hmm. She was six months old when I started my internship. 
 
 
Yeah, so then – and I also got a lot of (and this was in medical school and residency, less 
so in fellowship), but I got called a nurse more times than I can even count. They thought 
I was always the nurse, and not the doctor.  
 
LG: 
When you say “they,” who do you mean? 
 
MB: 
The patients, other nurses [laughs], doctors, doctors from other specialties – yeah: 
everybody. 
 
[Laughter] 
 
[46:05] 
 
 
Yeah. The flipside of that, though – the male nurses were often referred to as doctors.  
 
LG: 
So, there’s still that stereotype? 
 
MB: 
There was still that stereotype, yep. So, I always wore my white coat that had my name, 
with MD behind it, always (or my badge that said MD), always. Because people didn’t 
know.  
 
 
This day and age I think we are getting better, making less assumptions. But back then 
that’s how it was. 
Physician Oral History: Mary Burris 
Page 22 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MB: 
“Back then” was only ten or 11 years ago. [Laughing] We’re not talking like 40 or 50 
years ago. So, yeah; so, that was a little strange.  
 
 
And then “back then” we didn’t have (I used air quotes: “back then”) we didn’t have 
maternity leave. And I had my, you know, second child and I didn’t have maternity leave 
for that either.  
 
LG: 
What year was that? 
 
MB: 
He was born in 2007, right before my fellowship. It’s kind of a joke between my husband 
and I that being eight months pregnant for my residency interviews and my fellowship 
interviews is my schtick. 
 
[Laughter] 
 
 
But of course, you can’t talk about being pregnant during your interviews. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MB: 
Or they can’t ask you, anyway; but I was eight months pregnant – so, it was elephant in 
the room. So, I always brought it up and allowed them to talk about it, and it was fine. 
But it was my schtick. 
 
 
So, I had to, you know, I had to save up leave time – like my vacation time, and use part 
of that. And luckily, though, the U is very family-friendly and flexible. And so, they 
really worked with me on how to figure it out. But at the time, they didn’t have a policy –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MB: 
On maternity leave; we had to just get creative.  
 
LG: 
Yeah.  
 
MB: 
Which they did, and I appreciate it. So, but now we have a policy for it, and people get 
maternity leave.  
 
[48:06] 
 
LG: 
Were you treated any differently, as a female going through your residency and training? 
 
MB: 
I would say – I’m thinking back – with psychiatry? No. I would psychiatry was very 
supportive and equal and I never had any problems with that in my residency and 
fellowship.  
Physician Oral History: Mary Burris 
Page 23 
 
 
In medical school, I think there was a little bit of a bias going through, especially with 
some of the specialties like surgery – they tend to be more geared towards men.  
 
 
So, like in orthopedic surgery they would assume I wasn’t strong enough to do some of 
the manipulations they had to do with the equipment – which may or may not have been 
true. But I wasn’t given the opportunity to try. They assumed I didn’t have the strength or 
torque to, you know, move what I needed to move.  
 
 
But you don’t say anything –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MB: 
You know, you just kind of go with it. But then my male counterparts (who were bigger 
than I am) were given the opportunity to do those manipulations. Yeah.  
 
 
But then I also tried to, you know, think in my mind all the things I had to do physically 
in forensic pathology with, you know, bodies that couldn’t help me maneuver –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MB: 
[Laughs] You know? 
 
LG: 
Yeah, they’re not very manipulatable. 
 
MB: 
No. They’re very unhelpful –  
 
LG: 
[Laughing] 
 
MB: 
In terms of moving. So, yeah – so, there was a little bit of bias there, in some specialties. 
But I can’t say that it impacted me in a severely negative way; it was more of an irritation 
when it came to that kind of thing for me. 
 
[50:05] 
 
LG: 
Okay. What is the best thing about being a physician? 
 
MB: 
[Laughs] The best thing? 
 
LG: 
Or a best thing? 
 
MB: 
Um-hmm. There are a lot of good things about being a physician. The same thing that 
makes me stress is the same thing that I love – which is being responsible for patient care. 
Being the one to help patients through some of their darkest hours, or their most stressful 
times.  
 
Physician Oral History: Mary Burris 
Page 24 
 
I really feel like I can impact people’s lives in a positive way, and a very deep and 
meaningful way. And I really love that. I love people who get better; who take my advice 
and change how they do things, and then their life gets better. I think that’s the biggest 
thing I like.  
 
 
I think that’s why you go into this: you want to help people – that’s the bottom line. I do 
feel like I help people. I wish I did hear more of those stories, long-term –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MB: 
But I don’t.  
 
LG: 
Wow. 
 
MB: 
Sometimes I have to hear it from the out-patient doctors, who follow them long-term, and 
I get the stories that they’re doing better, which is really nice.  
 
 
I like science, I like the brain; and so, this also ticks the intellectual part of me. So, it’s 
like the emotional part and the intellectual part: I like learning things. Being a doctor 
requires life-long learning, so it’s a very easy match for me, because I like learning. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MB: 
So, because it requires that it’s just an easy fit, I think.  
 
 
I also like teaching. And I teach medical students, I teach residents; and by teaching 
them, it also forces me to keep on my toes with the most relevant information. So, I like 
that.  
 
[52:08] 
 
 
I like trying to be a role model for the up and coming physicians: trying to help them, you 
know, manage all this information, manage the darkest hours, manage anxiety (their own 
anxiety); helping them develop as a physician-person, and not just a physician –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MB: 
If that makes sense? 
 
LG: 
Yeah. 
 
MB: 
Because there is a lot more to it than just the knowledge base, obviously. 
 
 
I also like the flexibility of being a physician; I feel like you can work as much or as little 
as you want. 
 
Physician Oral History: Mary Burris 
Page 25 
LG: 
Really? 
 
MB: 
Um-hmm. Yeah, even surgeons; I mean, you can work part-time. 
 
LG: 
Right. 
 
MB: 
And there’s downsides to that, because then if you’re working part-time, you might not 
get the, you know, the benefits, whatever – there’s all that like HR kind of stuff that you 
deal with. But yeah – you can work certain hours, you can work part-time.  
 
 
I think there is sort of a pressure for physicians to work 80 hours a week [laughs], still. 
And working part-time, sometimes, is frowned upon – but you can do it. And I think 
especially in psychiatry, there’s more flexibility. I can definitely work part-time if I 
wanted to – I choose not to, but it’s there.  
 
LG: 
What’s the worst thing, when you think about being a physician? Or a worst thing? 
 
MB: 
It’s some of the same stuff, actually. So, it’s like a double-edged sword, you know? Or 
two sides to one coin. 
 
 
The responsibility of caring for people. I mean, they put a lot of faith and trust into your 
opinions and your recommendations. And it has a lot of weight. Because then you think, 
“Boy, I hope I made the right decision for them. I hope this is the way for them to go.”  
 
 
But we use a lot of information – I use my knowledge base, plus all my experience to 
give that recommendation. And evidence-based medicine, you know, read journal articles 
and you know, what is the latest recommendation for x, y, or z? So, we put it all together 
and give a treatment plan for that person. And so, I think that’s really hard to have that 
weight that you were the one that they’re trusting for that recommendation.  
 
[54:35] 
 
 
I think the other hard part is when things don’t go as planned. You don’t get the good 
outcome. You have a kid who ends up committing suicide, or they get a side effect from 
your medication that might be permanent: that’s hard. And so, it’s just really important 
that you educate the families about those things. You know, there is a potential that this 
might not work –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MB: 
And they have to know that. And there’s a potential that they could get an awful side 
effect of this medication. Those are hard parts. Yeah. 
 
LG: 
Is there anything else that you would want people who don’t come from medical 
backgrounds to know about being a doctor, or what it’s like being a doctor?

MB: 
It’s harder than you think [laughs]. I think sometimes the perception about doctors – this 
is interesting, it’s kind of meta – like my perception on perceptions –  
 
[Laughing] 
 
 
You know? [Laughs] 
 
 
My perception about general public perception is that we just sit around in our big 
offices, with fancy cars and money, and just kind of willy-nilly make decisions about 
things and people’s care. We don’t really care, we just want to cash in and get as many 
patients as we can possibly get.  
 
 
I hope that most people in this world have a good connection with their doctors, and have 
a positive rapport with them, and understand the depth and breadth of knowledge that 
doctors have to have – no matter what their specialty.  
 
 
Just because you’re a hand surgeon, and that’s all you do is hands – they’ve had that 
training in ob/gyn, and family medicine and derm – I mean, they’ve had the whole 
training. They know so much, and they’ve been through so much to get there, because 
they care about you as a patient. That’s why they went into it – that’s why they went into 
all the pain – 
 
[Laughter] 
 
 
You know? The tests, the tests, upon tests, upon tests, the board exams (that we still have 
to take throughout our lives) – we have to do maintenance of certification until we die.  
 
LG: 
Yep. 
 
[57:02] 
 
MB: 
I mean that’s just – it’s ongoing. 
 
 
All the hours and hours and hours of work – it’s because we want to care for people. We 
really want to help people feel good and feel better, and live longer, healthier lives; that’s 
why. 
 
 
And so, I think that’s the main perception that I would want to break. We’re not doing 
this just to be doctors, and have the prestige, and you know, all that. I mean, there’s not a 
whole lot of prestige, to be honest with you. But we really want to help people, you 
know? And we went through a lot of work to get here.  
 
LG: 
Folklorists actually have a term for that perception of perception. 
 
MB: 
What is that?

LG: 
It’s called the esoteric/exoteric factor. 
 
MB: 
Oh, I like that –  
 
LG: 
[Laughing] 
 
MB: 
That’s funny [laughs]. 
 
LG: 
So, like perceptions we have of ourselves, versus the perceptions that we think other 
people –  
 
MB: 
Have. 
 
LG: 
Have of us –  
 
MB: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
As groups, you know? 
 
MB: 
Yeah, yeah. 
 
 
But I don’t think we could ever get rid of all negative perceptions. I mean, you’d have to 
live it or walk the walk to truly understand what someone’s going through, in general. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MB: 
You know? But it would be nice if some of the stigmas would go away [laughs]. 
 
LG: 
That’s interesting, because there is a different perception of doctors as sort of, you know, 
heroes, or you know? 
 
MB: 
Yeah, there’s that too. 
 
LG: 
[Inaudible] you know? 
 
MB: 
I don’t think that’s as often, though. 
 
LG: 
Really? 
 
MB: 
And I think it might also be specialty-specific. I think a lot of doctors working with 
cancer get more of that. But in some ways, maybe they deserve it – because they work 
with a very hard population. 
 
LG: 
Yeah, yeah; for sure. 
 
MB: 
You know what I mean?

LG: 
Oh, yeah. 
 
MB: 
Yeah; they have a very dark work, if you will. 
 
LG: 
Anything else you’d like to add? 
 
MB: 
I don’t think so. 
 
LG: 
Okay.  
 
 
Again, this is Lisa Gabbert; I’m talking to Dr. Mary Burris –
