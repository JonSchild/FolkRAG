Dear Bess:
 
It is with mixed feelings that I write this letter to you, and I
 
think you will understand why.
 
At Christmas I am getting married, which makes me very happy, but
 
the unfortunate part of it is that since I shall be living in
 
Virginia I won't be able to continue working with you.  Would that
 
I could do both, but I can't.
 
However, Collins-Knowlton-Wing will go on as it now does as a
 
division of Curtis Brown.  Henriette Neatrour, who has been around
 
here about as long as I have, will be running things in my stead.
 
Arthur Martin will be turning into her assistant.
 So you will be
 
dealing with the same people who are already familiar with every-
thing, anyway.
 
We see no disruption--except, I shall miss being a part of it all.
 
Sincerely,

o-sO.  Let that be my excuse.
 
am particularly proud (using
 
'ni
 meahings)that you say in your inscription that I in -

Tdvertently started you down this particular road.
 I do remember
 
that when we jointly talked at several of Wayland Hand's evening
 
'
xtension courses you had a bemused look at some of my expiosive'
 
off the cuff remarks, but if anything I thought you were a lit "
 
horrified when I suggested that some of the lullabies and game
 
people used with children were an unconscious attempt to get e
 
i
ith them.
 Or was it my contrast between the way white childrc
 
only reluctantly allowed their younger siblings into a singing
 
'ame while black ones  incorporated even the toddlers and gave
 
praise for their
 
the younger ones
 
I
'll never know, vdll T?
 :t any rate if I
 
T had started half a dozen people on ideas that they had deve c '
 
oven half as well as you have, I
'd feel justified for n0t being ab
 
to finish books of my own.  Rest assured I would never had the im.
 
ation and ability to work hard to equal yours, nor the maghifi-
cent ability to get into another person's skin and then be ab1
 
interpret the person and her culture to another group.
 It's t
'
 
-ind of thing Melville Jacobs was getting at about the need to
 
late a culture to understand an Indian folktale---only you have dor
 
without jargon and with such deceptive simplicity and clarity

)ear  iss Rogers:
 
I am shocked to realize that it has been three
 
weeks since I rac ived your nice letter.
 I have been struggling
 
with an infected tooth a.d i bad cold during this pertoA -
-
 not to
 
mention the conttnual education of the young -
-
 and my brain has
 
been so soggy that s
'tch vItal d ci io s as whether to scramble or
 
boil the bre' kfast eg s hay, re-duce-0 me on occasion to i  dithering
 
idiot.
 I fe l a hit l,s  like a sleepwalker tojay,  though, and
 
have actually mann
e
d to wrap and get my carbon of th  nanuscript
 
down to the p
cmt o fic .
 I '
1
.so dro p
1 arjrr e f
loi m1ly a note
 
Fayin;' that I was st
i
l
l
-
1
1 al ive and would be back to work on the book
 
this week, but I did not mention you, since I thought you should
 
be  llowad at last to look at th  ma:iuscrii-t before you were com-
mitted.
 (As I look at that last sentence, it occurs to me that one
 
could read more than one interpretation into it.
 So be it.)
 
"y own fe1ing is that you will not find two books
 
hiding in on  manu3cri't but r'th,r tb t it is addres3lng more than
 
one au(iience at the sane t
ime.  This seems to me unorthodox but not
 
really immor l an
d, A
 f it could come off,  should be an advantage
 
when it comes to
 Th  question is really wbeth r it can be
 
pulled off more effect v ly than in this attempt.
 
.Ass "onn l1y sent me back one section of mss • with
 
pencilled editorial suggestions.
 i
octly they revolve around problems
 
of form rath r than content, and I s
in greatly relieved; her 2reVious
 
letters had
 ven me  the impression th t she wanted to tear it to bits.
 
She is concerned about the introduction which is indeed far too long;
 
she dislikes footnotes which are easily dispensed with; and she really
 
doesn' t want anything that sounds too hard.  This I will have to quar-
rel with her (or someone) about.
 
I should 1i' e to work ovor her notes on the r
nanuscri,t
 
in detail this week, and there is also some rewriting I want to do on
 
my own -
-
 a coupl  of points whIch I do not think I ma -!e as clearly
 
as I could have.
 .hen I :
n through wi t
h those chores,  should I send
 
the results back to  iss '
)onneily or to you?  I will tean in on the
 
whole
 Oj CC
 this week and hopefully be raiy to :ov  as soon as I
 
hear from you.
 
Perhaps a phone conversation would be in order when
 
you've h

 1as  r ier
nb r it should be con-
sidered in part a kind of  tst- raft; it obviously n

incisions, especially in the introduction.

coming Thursday,  ay only day at hor3e.

termining of who exactly the book was to be aimed at.  The consensus herS-

ems to be at the elementary school music teacher and the people involved

f
olk lore is an obvious candidate as a reader--simply because there is so
 
ry little already written on the subject.  However, prime target and f
c ,  
the teacher.  Bearing this market in mind, I think will help solve r
 
your problems.  As you say, you have woven into the script everyiin
 
the subject.  What it now needs is simple direction and focussing.
 
sense some clarity will be effected simply by getting the book into t

this ground work squared away before we can get a contract o

Dear Josephine Rogers:
 
in case you have totally forgotten me,
 
I
'm the one with the over-stuffed manuscript of Negro childrens
 
games that has given you so much trouble.  As you  may remem
ber,  
I was off in Colorado this past summer where -
-
 as I might have
 
expected -
-
 I was kept too busy to ge t in muc
h ti me  on revisin:
 
the manuscript.
 But I have been working on it, and it is almost
 
done.
 I hope to send it to you by the end of next week.
 
The main thing I have done in the re-editin.
 
is to eliminate the old "essays", working the important information
 
into the chapter introductions; I have cut; and I have tried to
 
relax the general tone so that it doesn't sound quite as stuffy.
 
(this has made it longer in spots; I am horribly af ra i
d that, 
after all my agony, it may turn out to be just as long as it was
 
originally.)  Also I have tried to bring up 3essie's role as
 
a teacher; this seems to me to clarify the double authvvship:
 
i
3essie as ori,
•inator and me as interpreter.
 I do think the total
 
mss. is improved, though no doubt it could still be tightened.
 
I am beginning to feel a serious need for an editor.
 
At this point, I need a favor from you.
 
The original manuscript was sent, as you know,  to Doubleday;
 
Aarjorie Donnelly sent me back two sections from it with her own
 
editorial revisions before she went off to her new job.
 Now I
 
need phe rest of it; some pages could be used as is, saving some-
what on my retypin  chores.
 1
ore important, I need the extra
 
copies of the music pages that are in that first version. Could yo
 
possibly call up Doubleday, find out who has it and  et them to
 
return it to me air mail?
 I don't know whom to address there
 
myself.
 
busy but rather fun.
 
I hope your summer was pleasant; mine was

Dear Josephine  ogers:
 
Well, here it is again -
-
 old "Step It Down", the bad
 
Penny -
-
 though wider separate cover.
 I think I have cut it,
 
though by now I
'm not even sure of that; I also think it is perhaps
 
less schizophrenic in tone.  At least I tried.
 There are several
 
possibilities for further cutting/simplifying which I think 1 will
 
leave up to you and/or whatever editor takes the project or.
 
1)
 "Rap Jack" (the last of the "Outdoor Games" section)
 
may be objected to by the most unflappable of editors.
 7rankly,
 
I have left it in as a kind of stalking-horse, hoping that nobody
 
will notice by comparison some of the other things that might also
 
he thought of as "unsuitable" ft
hr children.
 I
'd like to keep it
 
in for perspective and scholarly completeness,
 but if anyone turns
 
really green over it, let it go.  Actually, it's mild stuff com-
pare(l to what the kids see every day on television.
 
2
)
 I have marked in pencil several paragransh for
 
possible cutting throughout the manuscript; I
'm too tired at the
 
moment to look them up for you.
 Let them Ro, let them go, Cod
 
bless them.
 
3
)
 I have been arguing with myself for a lo"g time
 
about the entire last section (
Songs and Stories).
 In a way i
 
like it and in a way I don't.
 The last sequence (Rabbit and the
 
Possum) though fascinating, maybe should go; but if anybody wants
 
to fool with the section more than to eliminate that, I
'd rather
 
cut the whole thing.
 Actually it was my idea x
imv rather than
 
F
3essie's, and I
'm not completely convinced it belongs.
 However,
 
since I
've already done all the work on it,  I thought I
'd leave
 
it in and ask an editor to think about it for a while.
 
I still don't feel that I have settled the sixty-four
 
thousand dollar question of who is goi'g to read this book, but
 
I do think more of a consistent tone has been struck, and it's my
 
tone, and I don't think I can do much more about it.
 !
iy strength
 
as a teacher apparently is s kind of informal informational style
 
and an ability to juxtapose ideas in unexpected combinations, and
 
I simply don't communicate any other way.
 I surely have tried
 
these past months.
 
I have now forgotten entirely what I so blithely ac
rreed
 
to do about the business end of thinps.
 I believe either you or
 
I was  going  to settle the matter of song copyright with Al
 rackman,
 
and either you or I or the publisher -
-
 whoever he may be -
-
 was
 
going to write the other Islanders n"d ofCer them a fee.
 I have
 
ruthlessly cut almost all of their contributions as far as songs
 
go, so that really it is just their participation in the learn ng
 
teaching experience that is left.
 It is possible, of course,
 
that they taught 3essie some of the songs to begin with, but I
 
absolutely decline to go into that; IhI taught them to me ,  and
 
e and I have the tapes to prove it.
 :
iowever, I still think
 
that Bessie would be more comfortable if the others were offered
 
some kind of a flat payment.  Please write me what I should have
 
already done, and I will do it.
 
And let me know if you think the mss, is in satisfactory
 
condition or not.
 I have no perspective whatever left.
 
Cordially,
 
Bess  awes
 
P
. S
.
 After I had numbered all the pages, it occurred to me that
 
perhaps the ""ote to Scholars" mi ht be moved to the e
'.d, imme-
diately (
and logically) preceding the Annotations, a section which
 
only scholars will or could love.
 I couldn't face renumbering,
 
and anyway don't have strong feelings one way or the oth er;  however,
 
if the introduction still seems too ion ,
 this would be one a way
 
of shortenin  it.
 
P
. .S.
 I i
aay already have written you about this, but my friends
 
Guy and Candie Carawan have put out a book of interviews and
 
pictures of Johns Island, South Carolina (a spot similar to but
 
different from st Simon's).
 The pictures are particularly fine,
 
and I understand their photographer has hundreds more that he 
didn't use, including many of c
Llildren playing.
 If anyone brings
 
up the question of illustrations, this mi ght ho o"e solution,
 
g
 
In any event, I
'd su;
est you take a look at the hook -
-
 it's a
 
beauty -
-
 titled "Ai-It You Cot a tight to the Tree of
.
.
. Life" -
-
 
a large flat paper-back book similar in format to the "amily of
 
'
I
an" reprint.

giving you vast opportunity for inserting bits of folklore that will ap e l

Dear Josephine Rogers:
 
Your pleasant and extremely heartening
 
letter arrived during my twice-yearly struggles with final
 
exams, term papers and other end-of-semester crises; I
'm sorry
 
it has taken me so long to pull my brains back into reasonable
 
shape.
 I have forwarded your letter to Alan, and also sent a
 
copy of it to Al 3rackrnan, along with a letter from me, a copy
 
of which I am enclosing for you .
 Somehow I keep remembering
 
that Lewis Carroll line about "It all returned from him to you
 
though it was mine before"...
 
In any event, if Mr. Brackman follows
 
through properly, you should be hearing from him shortly; I
 
think he is the one who will have to have the final say on
 
matters of credit lines and all, though Alan will referee if
 
needful.
 There really should not be any particular problem;
 
I did eliminate all songs that couldn't properly be laid at
 
Bessie's door -
-
 I think, I hope -
-
 so the only thing that needs
 
settling is just how the credit lines should read.
 Further,
 
Doubleday has dealt with both Alan and Al Brockman before, so
 
they should be quite calm about the whole matter.
 
Have you shown the book to Doubleday
 
again?  I hope I haven't delayed matters on your end too badly.
 
And thanks again for your cordial and painstaking letter; I
 
was beginning to feel lonely indeed.
 
Cordially,
 
Bess Lomax Hawes
 
P.S.
 Let's do hold off on the matter of the I
slanders' fee until
 
we have at least the offer of an advance.
 When we know more spe-
cifically what kind of advance we can get and when, I can write
 
Bessie and come to a more realistic agreement with her than I
 
think we could reach now.

Dear Bess,
 
All of what you had to say in your February 4tIr
 1
 letter us
-s most s
ensible
 
and to the point.
 
Al Brac1

rIar to uritino you his le Lsr O

he uaae it absolutely dour that he -.
t
ants to coo  rate in every way 5oss
 
bla.
 
Then yesterday Alan Lomax called and we had a nice discussion.  He says
 
that the understanding is that after a final checking, which he doesn't
 
;
ant to do until the book is under contract, all songs are available for
 
oublication with no payment and they will be happy to supply whatever
 
information and data that may be required.  It makes absolute sense to
 
wait for final checking until script is set to go to the printer for the
 
publisher, for reasons of length or whatever, may be forced to do some
 
cutting and therefore some of the songs now included may have to come out.
 
uch to my surprise, Ken McCormick has declined the book for Doubleday.
 
This puzzles me and from his enclosed
. letter I would guess that it is
 
more the decision of the publishing board.  Actually, I cannot say thu
.
 
I am too downhearted about this.  There were reasons both pro and con
 
for Doubleday publishing and
. I never have been absolutely sure that
 
would be the right publishers.  I s
in now trying Simon & Schuster who, I
.
 
they do take it, could well do a good job of
 
I know you were rather counting on Doubleday Lu.  ies

As I was telling Mr. Lomax yesterday, whenever a book is of a specializc
 
nature it can sometimes take a goodly time to find the right publisher.
 
So if you will just bear with me while we go through this process.

Curtis Brown, Ltd. and Collins-Knowlton-Wing, Inc. are two
 
distinct corporate entities, which share the same offices, the same
 
officers and personnel, and the same methods of operation.  The
 
distinction between them lies only in each corporation's client group,
 
and the specializations of the various staff members.  Those staff
 
members who deal mainly with one client group regularly consult and
 
work with all others within the office, so that in practice there are
 
few boundaries indeed.  Each of our authors, although continuing to
 
work through his usual contact, should always feel free to consult with
 
any agent in the office.
 
As you will see from what follows, the agency covers the entire
 
spectrum of markets for literary properties.  Staff members specialize,
 
of course, but everyone keeps abreast of developments in all other fields
 
through constant and deliberate inter-office conversations, staff meetings,
 
and workaday situations.  There is much more consultative communication
 
among staff members than many clients might imagine, and as a result,
 
there are many more knowledgable minds at work on behalf of each client
 
than he or she might suspect.
 
The agency deals with, and various staff members specialize,
 
in the following fields:
 
Dramatic or performance rights (motion pictures, television, etc.);
 
foreign translation rights; serial publication rights (domestic and
 
foreign magazines are included); book rights, and, as nearly separate
 
operations under that broad heading, trade books, textbooks, children's
 
and religious books.
 
Since few writers stick to one category of work exclusively,
 
we would like to take this opportunity to introduce you to the entire
 
staff, and would suggest that you keep these pages on file as a reference
 
source for your future dealings with your agency.
 
DRAMATIC, TV, AND PERFORMANCE RIGHTS:
 
Blossom Kahn heads the Curtis Brown and Collins-Knowlton-Wing
 
dramatic department.  Almost alone among literary agencies, our two
 
companies deal with motion picture, TV, and dramatic rights as a part of
 
the New York Office operations.  Many of you have seen how effective this
 
has been as radical changes have taken place in the production of films,
 
and New York has become more important to film makers than ever before.
 
Miss Kahn maintains close relations with West Coast offices and travels
 
to the Coast several times a year.
 
FOREIGN TRANSLATION RIGHTS:
 
Elizabeth Mowat heads the CE and CKW foreign department.  She
 
works directly with agents we have appointed to represent us in France,
 
Italy, Germany, Portugal, Spain, the South American countries, the Netherlands,
 
Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland, and Japan.  She also deals with the
 
publishing authorities in Poland, Yugoslavia, and Czechoslovakia.
 
MAGAZINE -
 SERIAL RIGHTS:
 
Emilie Jacobson, a new vice-president of

Dykstra responsible for the CKW magazine material.
 
closely with all the other agents at CE and CKW in
 
material.
 
BOOK tPARTMENTS:
 
Curtis Brown, heads both
 
Priscilla Woodsy and with Susan
  
Miss Jacobson works
 
placing their book
 
Martha Winston has l
aeen appointed head of both CE and CKW
 
book departments.
 
TEXTBOOKS:
 
Gerard McCauley is in charge of the college department of CE
 
and CKW.  This department is unique among literary agencies.  It has been
 
three and a half years since Gerry left the publishing side of the college
 
field to join us, and he has made enormous progress.
 
CHILDREN'S AND RELIGIOUS BOO M:
 
Marilyn Marlow heads the children's book department at Curtis
 
Brown, which has developed so importantly in recent years.  She also
 
handles many clients in the general adult and religious book fields.
 
TRAIE BOOKS:
 
Martha Winston, a new vice-president of Curtis Brown, long has
 
been a staff member handling a substantial list of American clients in the
 
trade field.
 
Josephine Rogers of Collins-Knowlton-Wing continues to handle the
 
affairs of many CKW authors and a number of A. P
. Watt authors in the
 
U. S
.  Like Marilyn Marlow, she is also a specialist in the children's book
 
field, with her own grouping of writers.
 
Ruth Bond represents a number of CKW authors and the U
. S
. interests
 
of many A. P
. Watt clients in the U. S
., as well as the Estate of Edgar
 
Wallace, and others.
 
Frieda J. Spiller continues to represent Hodder & Stoughton books

Perry H
. Knowlton, who works with all the various departments, personally
 
managing a group of clients for both CB and CKW, as well as involving himself
 
whenever and wherever needed with the affairs of any other client represented
 
by the agencies.  James McCawley, Mr. Knowlton's executive assistant, works
 
closely with him in several areas.  Frieda Spiller, also executive assistant
 
to Mr. Knowlton- in addition to her other duties, works with him in many

Mrs, Bess Hawes
 
Dear Bess,
 
The enclosed letter had already been dictated and I will simply add
 
another.
 
July 3rd would be fine by me.  You're right; we will be closed
 
Thursday and
. Friday.  Could you i ke it 11 o
'clock, Wednesday,
 
July 3rd?
 
Don't be too concerned that things s
eem to be moving in slow
 
motion.  Any specialized book always takes time and in actual
 
fact it would be pretty much impossible to get the book out
 
this year.  Generally count on nine months for production.
 
Much as I bate to forecast it, I think the educational climate
 
in which this book would be useful is going to be with us an
 
awfully long time.  I
'll try and s
ee if you can't meet with
 
Norton while you are here that Wednesday.  Since you are caning
 
this way why don't you bring the carbon of the s
cript with you
 
and we will let Norton do the xeroxing -  -  -
 whichever is easier
 
for you.
 
Sincerely,
 
JR/il

Dear Bess,
 
I
t has been known to happen, but fortunately rarely, that a manuscript
 
g
ets lost.  In this particular case STEP IT DOWN was in the briefcase
 
belonging to Bill 1
kMorris of Norton when it got stolen from the
 
coffee shop in Pennsylvania Station.  As you can imagine, everybody
 
is quite aghast and terribly upset and we've been hoping that it would
 
be returned
..  It hasd t and we can only conclude that it has suffered
 
the same fate as did
. T
 • E
 • Lawrence's SEVEN PILLARS TO WISDOM, which
 
evaporated from the left luggage room at Victoria Station in London.
 
In that instance there was no copy.  I just hope that you have one.
 
Rather than trust a carbon to the mails, would you get your copy
 
xeroxed, s
end that to me together with the bill which I shall have
 
Norton pay right away.  I hate to put you to this extra trouble and
 
it is absurd that such things t
hould happen.  So far, Norton are
 
favorably impressed but, unfortunately, Bill hadn't read the whole
 
thing.  I think mainly what troubles publishers is the marketing
 
angle and I
've discussed with Bill our line of thinking.
 
Sincerely,
 
\

a  Jos e
 me:
 
I am not surprised at the news From  orton;
 
own feeling was that our lunch  (
late represented an apology
 
rather than a ny  real interest in doing business.
 I
'
f Thopf
 
turns out sour also, how about trying the University o  Chicago
 
?ress? I am ra idly coming to the conclusion that the book in
 
its presert form is a folklore book -
-
 if it's anything at all -
-
and should be presented in that manner,
 The U
. of Chi's folklore
 
series is first-class; I have heard extremely nice things about
 
their royalties, distribution etc., and they exnressed interest
 
in the book in a note to me over a year a,
-
.,o
.
 
Though I agree with you that the problem to
 
which the book is in part addressed is  oing to be with us  for
 
a long time, my own experience tells me that fashions in crises
 
change fairly rapidly, and I
'll bet we are almost at the end  -
-
not of the crisis, god :nows -
-
 but of the period of wide public
 
concern with this particular crisis.
 I really think speed is
 
called for.
 I am also getting a lot of professional pressure to
 
;uhlish; though perishing is not in question, various more positive
 
oportunities are.
 Fesides, if I had any assurance that the book
 
in its present form is actually going to come out, I could turn
 
what few brains I have left to the obvious strategy of workin - up
 
a childrens' book spin-off, if that's the technical term.
 )
ne of
 
thc
' i
:
leas that has occurre4 to me, for instance, is to see if
 
coul'n't bring to7ether a brief, selective compilation of .eSt
 
African anrl  Afro- mericar childrens eames -
-
 the kind of t
'
riina, that
 
might go over as a trade book for the chil'tei.:

Dear Bess,
 
I agree that the University of Chicago's Folklore Series is first
 
class and, as far as university presses go, they are indeed one of
 
the best and upon occasion they do seem capable of universal d
is-
tribution.
 
It so happens that in this morning's mail came a turndown from
 
Knopf (

to Morris Philipson at the University of Chicago Press.  Letts
 
hope things work out with them.

 In the process, - 
it only improved the organization, as I think we both agree, I
 
L
iminated footnotes and some of the scholarly trappings which
 
ubleday editors thought superf locus.
 I am not at all sure thr
.
 
e way the University of Chicago Press editors would feel about-
'
,
 
depending on who they are; however, I know folklorists, and
 
know the first thing they look at in any manuscript is the h
 
ography and the damn annotations.
 The idea is that these
 
ctions prove you've done your homework and that you haver
.
 
.
.
de everything up out of your own head; anyway, if they've
 
e manuscript to someone like Richard Dorson, I know he woutc wa

 I wonder if there would be any
 
ctful way to
 explain to the U

capable of putting back what was left out if they would pref'
 
that way.
 (For example, I eliminated from the bibliography

Dear Bess,
 
Marjorie Martas of the Ford Foundation and I have been having
 
conversations on and off about STEP IT DOWN.
 
Actually, the University of Chicago Press did turn it down and I am
 
enclosing their l
etter.  I don't think it had anything to dowith
 
authenticating of fact and research for I think that the script
 
speaks eminently for itself and they know, if required, you could
 
come up with the proper acknowledgements, bibliography, etc.  I
 
had also spoken to two of the editors at Houghton Mifflin about
 
it and, unfortunately, it was a negative conclusion reached by
 
them too.
 
In the course of talking with Marjorie Martas, we exchanged views
 
and, largely in the l
ight of her conments, I have now sent it to
 
Alfred Prettyman at Harper & Row.  Harper is currently setting up
 
a program into which this book would logically fit -
-
 at least
 
according to my reasoning and also Marjorie Martas'.  In fact, we
 
have just heard from Alfred Prettyman that they are interested in
 
the book, although the interest isn't firm yet.
 
I am really surprised that someone hasn't snapped the book up.
 
It certainly impressed me no end when I first saw it and I am a
 
bit aggrieved that previous editors haven't reacted in exactly
 
the same fashion.  However, it is largely a matter of hitting the
 
right publisher at the right time and it's never easy when a script
 
doesn't fit into the normal pigeonholes.  I really don't have any
 
doubts about our ultimate success in placing it, but I just wish it
 
wouldn t take so long for your sake.  So, keep your fingers crossed
 
where Harper & Row are concerned.
 
Sincerely,
 
JR/il

Dear Josephine Rogers:
 
You must have thought I
'd fallen down a well.  Actually, there's been
 
no s
uch drama.  Just away for a few days, family with HongKong flu and
 
the end of the s
emester all at the s
ame time.
 
I am of course totally delighted myself that Harpers wants the book.
 
The terms of the proposed contract s
eem more than fair; and I am s
ure
 
I s
peak for B
essie on t
his.  In fact, I do s
peak for Bessie, via Alan,
 
who called me the other day on another mEter and who gives his blessing
 
as her "manager".  P
erhaps when the contracts are actually drawn up,
 
you might call him and s
ee if he advises s
ending the contract directly
 
to her, to me, or to him.  I am writing her in the meantime, at Alan's
 
s
uggestion, and cautiously a
dvising her that there may be a lump of
 
money forthcoming to s

Dear Bess:
 
I can well understand too much at once.  Of course, I am
 
delighted that you are delighted about the Harper offer.
 
Hopefully, they will de a good job of publishing the book and
 
I shall get on with drawing up the contract.
 
There are a couple of points that we should get absolutely
 
clear and those primarily involve the music end of it.  You'll 
remember that back in February of last year Al Bracc an said
 
he would be happy to co-operate in every way.  However, there
 
were some specific titles which were unknown to him and he
 
would need clarification from you.  Would you get this sorted
 
out with him now.  In the contract, I shall simply specify that
 
proper copyright for the music will have to be carried, but
 
Mr. BracInan will have to provide the pertinent copyright
 
information for the music.
 
One further point I don't think we ever clarified and I imagine
 
that you will take care of this on your own.  That is the
 
remuneration that is due the four other contributors.  Properly
 
at this point I should draw up a collaboration agreement between
 
you and
. Bessie Jones, spelling out the provision that you and she
 
shall split fifty fifty on any proceeds derived from the work,
 
whether it be in translation, dramatic or magazine form etc.  It
 
would also provide that the two of you would split the fees due
 
the other participants.  We are thinking in terms of $50 apiece
 
or would $25 do?
 
It has been helpful chatting with Margery Martas and although the
 
Ford Foundation is not formally endorsing the work, anything they
 
do by way of showing interest is most helpful and their chat to
 
Al Prettyman was helpful.  Actually, perfectly timed as he has
 
recently changed positions at Harpers and six months ago, he would
 
not have been involved in such a scheme.  So it really is perfect
 
timing.
 
Do let me know what about the Music.
 
ncerely

Dear Bess:
 
Here are the Harper contracts for STEP IT DOWN which should now be signed
 
by you and by Bessie Jones.As they have already been signed by Harper,
 
you may each keep a copy simply returning one copy to me.
 
Actually before sending this agreement along to Bessie Jones for signing,
 
I really ought to have a collaboration agreement drawn up between the two
 
of you spelling out the 50 -
 50 split and allowing for the fees to be
 
paid the other for consultance.  Those fees, I think, should come off the
 
tope of the advance before dividing up the proceeds between you and Bessie
 
Jones.  If you have some different understanding, do let me know.  It is
 
also my understanding that Bessie Jones contributed the basic information
 
and also the music score and songs.  Your contribution is the writing,
 
interpretation and presentation.
 
It is Harpers' intention to bring the book out this fall and to do so,
 
we are going to have to give them, just as soon as we can, the copyright
 
information for the music.  You will remember that Al Braclenan felt that
 
each page should contain the proper copyright information and that the
 
copyright notice on the back of the title page would not suffice as it
 
does for the text.  I have not wanted to speak with him without consulting
 
you first.  Harper should be going into production very soon and so I
 
would appreciate getting all this straightened away as soon as we can.
 
It is highly possible, in fact it is the current Harper thinking, to bring
 
out two editions of the book concurrently.  A hardback one for institutional
 
use and then a paperback one for use by teachers and classes.  This strikes
 
me as being a wise move for the two markets in no way conflict and by bringing
 
out the paperback edition right away, we get the book into the schools which
 
is basically where we want it.
 
Do let me know about both copyright and the collaboration agreement.  Once we
 
are square on that, do get Bessie Jones to sian too.

I was talking with Al Prettyman.
, the Harper editor,, this morning.  He had noL
 
thought the script required any further work and.
, in fact.

i
"

work the way it stood,  However,, he and I are agreed that you should have a
 
chance to get the script into exactly the shape you wish and so he is sendir
,, -
it out to you right away*  Any changes should be made now, for as you say,
 
alterations in proof cost money and these can mount up extraordinarily fast.
 
Al would like to have it back as soon as you can get it to him., for alrea�i,-

production schedule is a tight one*  It well may be that he will postpon-

publication to his winter list - January/February, but it wo-

surprised me if he would not have had to do that anyway.
 
As to terms with us, camnission is 10% for anything sold on this side of tL
 
Atlantic, 15% on sales to England where we have to split with our English
 
counterpart and 20% on sales abroad involving other agents.  This is pretty
 
standard practice and I am enclosing a pamphlet explaining what a literary
 
agent is to help explain things to Bessie Jones.  I am enclosing our regu1 '
 
agency agreement and if you are agreable, you might as well sign that no;
 
that we have got a contract under way.  The other copy signed by me is fo r
 
you.  I would not worry Bessie Jones with this, but seeing this agreemen.
 
. ii also clarify things in your own mind.
 
I think I have covered everything, but if you have any questions, do call me.
 
It seemed simpler for you to see the collaboration agreement and the form it
 
would take before discussing things and that is why I simply went ahead instead
 
o
f calling you.

Dear Bess:
 
I am so glad you called the other day because it seemed to clear up the re-
maining matters.
 
I talked with Al Prettyman and he is perfectly prepared to await the contract
 
until you have had a chance to explain everything to Bessie Jones and get
 
her to sign.  We would just as soon not have this drag on any longer than
 
it must, so if you could get to this soon after her arrival, that would be
 
great.
 
Actually,
 has already sent off to you -
 last week -
 the script, so do
 
make whatever alterations you want to.  Then mail the whole works back to
 
him, letting me have a cony of the letter you write.  That way, I will 
know where we are.
 
As you suggested, I shall talk with Al Brackznan and it will be fine if he
 
will deal directly with Al Prettyman on all the music matter.
 
Sincerely,
 
Josephine Rogers

Dear Bess:
 
"hanks for sending along the contract which I have
 
dispatched to Al Prettyman.
 
Just how are we supposed to deal with Bessie Jones?
 
Presumably, there is no reason why we should treat
 
her any differently than we do any other collaborator
 
and so we really should have her address so that we
 
may send her accountings to her direct.  Harpers' is
 
due to pay that $3000 advance now upon signing and
 
our usual procedure would be to send you each your
 
share after deducting our commission.  Please then
 
let me have Bessie Jones address or, on the other
 
hand, should we '
be making her payments to her in
 
care of your brother.  Just let me know how you
 
wish us to proceed and we shall do so.
 
If you remember that day when we were talking on the
 
phone, you had mentioned that records probably did
 
not apply in the collaboration agreement.  However,
 
records have been left in as have xdiod  and tapes.
 
Was this an oversight or did you later decide that
 
it was alright to leave this variants in?  If they
 
indeed should be out, would you cross them in each
 
of your copies and let me know so that I can do the
 
same to mine.  Otherwise I shall leave them be.

Dear Josephine:
 
There i
s certainly no reason you shouldn't deal with Bessie Jones the
 
way you do any other author; just bear in mind that her handwriting i
s
 
unpracticed and her spelling insanely l
ogical.  She is the living proof
 
that mastery of phonics i
s not the sole answer to problems of literacy.
 
I read her letters aloud to myself; that's the only way.
 
I have talked to her about the proper disposition of the money - -
 in
 
the bank - -  and the contract - -
 in a safe deposit box; and she i
s all
 
set so far as I know.  Her address i
s 22 Harlem Lane, St. Simon's Island,
 
Georgia, and she will be expecting to hear from you.  Please don't l
et
 
my remarks in the first paragraph put you off; she i
s a delightful woman
 
of extraordinary intelligence - -  otherwise she couldn't possibly spell
 
the way she does'
.
 
Thank you for noticing the point about the records, radio and tapes in
 
the collaboration agreement.  They indeed should be cut out, and I have
 
corrected Bessie's any my copies accordingly.
 
I have applied for a year's leave from my teaching chores, and will be
 
in Berkeley for the academic year 1
969-700  As soon a
s I have any kind
 
of permandnt address there, I will let you know, of course.  I can be
 
addressed here until around July first; after that - -  unless we have
 
found a house by then - -
 i
t might be safer to write me do Department of
 
Anthropology, San Fernando Valley State College, Northridge, California.

Dear Bess:
 
The other day, I was talking with an editor about American folktales and in
 
particular the Gullah heritage that is found around Sea Island, Georgia and
 
Charleston.  It suddenly occurred to me that with your background, you might
 
be interested in putting together such a collection, if indeed there does exist
 
such a canon.  Actually, I was thinking in terms of such stories for children
 
and Judith Elliott at World is basically interested in the idea for they have a
 
series of folktales and are always on the lookout for more that have their
 
heritage in America.
 
This may be an absolutely wild idea but if you see any merit to it, you might
 
give me a bit of discussion on the subject that I could take up with Judith.
 
I hope that it is proving to be a nice summer for you.

terribly sorry that it had to happen to you and Bessie Jones.

Pear Josephine:
 
Just a quick note to let you know where I am.  Yrom now until the
 
end of June 1970 at least, I can be reached at the above address
 
or, if necessary by phone, at area code 415  527-2417.
 I shall
 
write and tell Yr. Prettyman of my move this afternoon on the
 
optimistic assumption that anybody in that firm cares where I am.
 
You know, I still find it absolutely inexplicable that I have heard
 
nothing from any in
dividual in that firm.  All they ever send me
 
are forms to fill out, and frankly, it makes me very nervous.
 
Isn't there anybody home there?  I still have no assurances from
 
anybody except you that they are not planning extensive editorial
 
revisions; my tentative queries to :r. P. about editorial usage
 
have gone unanswered; my suggestions to the publicity people about
 
people to contact have apparently fallen down a hole.
 I don't
 
know what the book will look like or whether it is scheduled to
 
come out this year, next year, sometime or never.
 I haven't heard
 
from the music editor (and there are some musical problems) or
 
the education editor or the boy who sweeps out the front hail.
 
Is anybody really interested at all?
 
In my darker moments I wonder vven if uarpers isn't bringing out
 
the book just to keep :
iarjorie
 
:
artus off its collective back,
 
since I suspect  .
iss  .
 of having brought pressure to hear.
 If
 
that is the case, I almost regret having signed the contract since,
 
in my limited experience in the book business, having a major pub-
lisher is no automatic guarantee of success.
 J
ou1d we perhaps have
 
done better to go to a smaller publisher who might bring some i
raagi-
nation and enthusiasm into the deal?
 The overall impression I get
 
from these people is of massive corporate indifference, end damned
 
L
E
E I want my baby brought out on the assembly line.
 
I guess all this sou n
ds as though my nose is just out of joint -
-
and perhaps it is - -
 but I do know that the book business is not
 
yet totally automatic, and that sensitive editorial scrutiny, creative
 
book design and imaginative promotion still play a vital part in the
 
success or failure of a book.  Are Bessie and I going to get this
 
from Harpers?  You're the fully experienced member of the team, and
 
I depe n
d upon your advice.
 Shall I write :r. Prettyman how I feel
 
or leave it up to you?
 This is, after all, :
g  first - -
 and possibly
 
my last -
-
 book, and I know it is a solid one and it could even be
 
a useful oneif it gets any kind of a fair shake.
 
deli, this started out as a note and turned
 
the sutamergoes on, I will possibly get less
 
tough one so far, full of moving and family
 
I am looking forware
t to a long quiet winter
 
into a production.  As
 
neurotic; it's been a
 
illness and other traumas,
 
taking a few courses at
 
Eerkeley and generally catching up with thecontents o
f uy
 
own head.
 The chock did arrive by the way -
-
 the one you said
 
had been lost.
 t
hat on earth happened to it anyway?

Dear Bess:
 
Yo u are not  neurotic at ali
t.
 There is no  arth1y
 
reason why an editor should be leaving an author out
 
in limbo.  I have just finished talking with Al
 
Prettyman and he is most abject for he fully realizes
 
that he has been somewhat remiss.  He promises to
 
write t o you for the last thing he wants is any feeling
 
on your part that you are being neglected.
 
Apparently your suggestions for revising the manuscript
 
were taken into consideration and it is just being
 
checked before going into final copyediting.  I also
 
mentioned to him that he had best check with the
 
RIchmond people on the music end of things for obviously,
 
all should be clear on the music credits.
 
No, don't have any fears about Harpers for indeed they
 
are a good house and they would never take on a
. book
 
simply because they have been talked into it by Marjorie
 
M
artus.  I think that they were interested in her
 
comments but, after all, the s
cript stands on its own
 
and from all that Al Prettyman has said is that he is
 
enormously interested in it and sees a very real place
 
for i
t.

Dear Josephines
 
Do you happen to have an extra copy of the manuscript of
 
STEL IT DOWN?  I seem to recall that there was a xerox copy
 
made by the people who lost the first one, so we ought to be
 
back up to the original total of three, I should think,
 And
 
I have one and I assume Harpers has ones so do you have the
 
third?
 
It isn't of vital importance, but a very nice woman who is
 
rather a big wheel as elementary educators go has written me
 
and asked to see an advance copy.
 I would like to oblige her,
 
as she is just retired from being head of that huge project
 
in elementary curriculum reform  (the Tri-State project in
 
Lincoln, Nebraska) but I don't want to let go of my last
 
remaining copy of the m
int mae* until the book is finally in
 
my hands,  So if you have the missing copy and if you don't
 
feel you need to hang on to it, could you send it to me?
 
I finally got a very nice letter from Mr .  Prettyman which I
 
haven't answered, having been away on a trip the past couple
 
of weeks, so I guess we're all evens
 
Cordially.

Dear Josephinos
 
Could you possibly call Prettyman up for me,
 
since it is clear that he never intends to write me about any-
thing I ask him, and find out what they are doing about illus-
trations if anything?  De I have any control over this question
 
at all?
 
I am rapidly reaching the point of no return
 
with Harpers and have just consulted my contract which I notice
 
says that the book is supposed to be published within six months
 
of the date of signing.
 It is now one year and I can see abso-
lutely no progress.
 Dams the whole business anyway - -
 I could
 
have carved the entire book on stone by now.

Dear Josephinet
 
It is now two months since your last letter.
 I have not heard
 
from Al Prettyman - -
 though I never really expected to - -
 nor
 
have I heard from the new editor either.
 
1.
 
I really do not want the new editor to take me "kindly under
 
her wing" anyhow.
 I want some one in authority at Harper and
 
Row to say that they are going to publish Step It Down and
 
when.
 In the four communications I have received from that
 
so-called publishing house in the past year (
including a note
 
from a secretary saying P
. was out of town and a questionnaire
 
from the publicity office) absolutely no mention has been made
 
of a possible publication date.
 If it hadn't been for your
 
letters of assurance and for the contract (which no one at
 
i
iarpers seems to have paid any attention to, since it seems
 
to me tba a ht4iat they agree to publish within six months)
 
I wouldn't think the book had been sold at all.
 
The only thing I can conclude from my misadventures on the
 
Now York market is that Step It Down is not a book that inspires
 
enthusiasm in trade publishers, though from what I see coining
 
out these days I should think it would do at least as well as
 
the average new trade book.
 However.  I am quite ready to
 
withdraw it and take it myself to the University of California
 
press which tentatively offered to put it out several years
 
agos and one of these days I am simply going to explode and
 
do it and to hell with the contract - -
 I
've lived up to my end.
 
In my last unanswered letter to Prettyman I rather nicely.
 
I thought at the time, offered to recopy the music for the
 
benefit of the printers since it was so confusingly marked over
 
by the music editor.
 Would you advise me to write Miss  c-
Coullough and repeat the offer, or ask for the mss. back, or
 
simply sit tight?  I am getting mighty tired of the latter posture.
 
Yours,

Dear Josephine:
 
After my latest ill-tempered communication, you may not be
 
exactly looking forward to hearing from me again so soon, but
 
I have just received a letter that might be of interest.
 As
 
you may or may not knbw.  I have put on an educational film
 
(distributed by t
'edia Center. University extension, University
 
of California at Berkeley) on black children's games as they are
 
now being played in Los Angeles. The film is titled Pizza Pizza
  
Daddy- U. and the enclosed letter is from a lady who wants to
 
use the title for her own book on black games.
 
I have written her suggesting that, since I have a book in the
 
works myself,  I think her use of the film title for her own
 
book would completely confuse everybody.
 However, this is some
 
concrete evidence to indicate that I am not the only worker in
 
this particular vineyard, which is one of the reasons I have
 
been getting increasingly more and more worried - -
 not only
 
by the delays but by i
l
iarper and  owe's apparent lack of interest
 
in the book.
 
It also occurs to me for the first time - -
 I am not very smart
 
about such things - -
 that there may be some joint publicity
 
value between Step It Down and the film (which is getting a
 
pretty heavy play currently in educational circles).
 hat would
 
you suggest my doing about it,  if anythingt

Dear Josephine:
 
You will be pleased to hear that I actually got a phone call from
 
Fran £cCu1lough this morning and we had a long and  -
 I hope - -
mutually satisfactory discussion about "Step It Down".
 Apparently
 
Al irettyinan has all the past correspondence about the book with
 
him, wherever he is, and only disgorged the mangled music last
 
week; he certainly must be a strange human being.
 
Anyway,  I agreed to recopy the music which she is returning to me
 
and I am sending her xeroxes of my carbons of all the correspondence
 
which seems to me conceivably useful.
 oor woman  -
 if my book
 
is any example, she must have inherited an absolutely fantastic
 
mess.
 T
he hadn't for example, even heard about the problem of
 
copyrighting the songs and seems to have no record of any of the
 
correspondence with Al Lrackmann.
 
e1L, at least we are in touch, and it looks as though 1 can stop
 
hasseling you and let you get on to some new business for a change.
 
I (
10 thank you for your good offices in the matter; hiss P
.,ccullough
 
impressed me as a sensible, friendly and efficient lady and perhaps
 
o f
i  t P it Down is safely launched at last.
 aybe one of these
 
days it will eve n be published and 1 can get on to thinking about
 
another book  -
 a masochistic thought if ever 1 had one.

o impress it upon both of them
 
t
hat they s
hould d
o everything in their power to get it out by then.
 
T
his may prove impossible because of the mechanics of the music,

Dear Josephine:
 
Sorry to have been so long answering your most recent letter, but it
 
arrived on the same day I discovered I am a new grandmother and I
 
naturally had to drop everything and dash off to perfor!r
: my grand-
motherly duties.
 Though mother and grandson are both in fine shape.
 
I only Just now managed to tear myself away; .new babies are really so
 
much fun though, as a friend warned me,  they C
_o seeir to come s
!ralier
 
than tnoy uced to.
 
Anyway,  in answer to yours of the 2th of Lpril,  I believe you mis-
understand the situation with  :
ichmond .
 They operate e clue ively.
 
as a music publishing and licensing house, so fr as I understand it,
 
and have no control over whether recordings are n
ade or not.
 Their
 
function i
s to copyripht songs and then collect and disburse royalties
 
earned by those songs whether they are recorded,  played rver the radio,
 
sung in night clubs or whatever.
 They sinply  erve as a kind of watch
 
do for the song copyright owner, disburse per issions to use material,
 
and see that proper royalties are paid and collected.
 
In other words,  if we want to have recording  made, we'd have to go
 
ahead and get a recording company interested;  they would then pay
 
Richmond performance royalties; hichmond would then pay Lessie,  the
 
Sea i
slanders,  klan, or whoever but no me, since I elected to stay
 
out of this end of the busLn ss.
 Thus Cichirond is only  involved with
 
performance rights on the songs and their lyrics;  they have nothin
,2
, to
 
do with the  are directions or any part of the book itself ecept for
 
seeing to it that the copyright is correctly cited according to law.
 
(
I hope this is clear; if it isn't maybe you could call whats-his-name
 
at Richmond and go over it with him.)
 
As far as the movie goes,  i
 am sending you one of the advertising
 
brochures put out by the Nedia Center people as well as a copy of
 
the  '
Teachers'  Handbook" I wrote to accompany the film.
 You will note
 
that, although the songs included are sii ilar to 2es';i '  ,
 none of them
 
are exactly the  ace.
 This i
s what happens all the tim e with traditional
 
material.
 There is simply no defensible way cf handling the problem;
 
you're damned if you do (which is  i
lan's position) and daneed i
f you
 
don't.
 The horn of the dilemma, you see,  t
'  if '
;omeOne like Alan
 
doesn't force Bessie to claim copyright, somebody else like darry
 
Belafonte might (
ICCL(iO to record wore of her stuff  nd then claim
 
copyright him:self, as he has (
lone with his traditional Jamaican material.
 
And it's nicer for Bessie or the Sea Islanders to get that cent a record
 
or whatever the performance royalty now is than for helafonte, who
 
doesn't appear to me to need it.
 
As to the book title,  I just don't know what to say.
 The film was
 
titled Pizza Pizza Daddy-0 because that was these particular childrens'
 
favorite game.
 Bessie, however, didn't really know the game but simply
 
reported it to me in a final interview as a "new" game which the children
 
in Georgia were just starting to play; and I only included her incomplete
 
description in the book in order to demonstrate that "new" games to
 
arise and that the tradition is still viable within the black child
 
community.
 At the time,  I hadn't a clue that the game was being
 
played on the '
vest Coast and now,  I gather, rai right across the country.
 
(
I did the film two years after the book, after all.)
 
Thus, except fot the tie-up with the film and the fact that it seems
 
to be a catchy t
itle, it seem s to i
nc that  izza  izza Laddy   would be
 
an inap?ropriaee
 title for the book.
 On the other hand,  I have never
 
been es- ecialIy Jazzed over :
;tep It Down. 
Naybe somebody at Harpers
 
would have an idea on the probleu;  I real y just don't know.
 
It seems a bit o
irinous to me that I haven't heard from .'ran :cCullough
 
since her phone ca l
l;  I had understood she was going to send me the
 
music for recopying right away, but I will refrain from hysterics at
 
this point.
 T
he i
s probably coping with  rettymnan's mess.
 Iease
 
give her t
ry best wishes and sympathies when you are next in touch.
 
Yours,
 
F

 I believe 1 will send Fran  i
cCullough a copy of the 4

I

 g
ather t

I
 do hop# you've been able to explain to Bess why t

s
o f

ome l
ater d
ate I
 don't want t
o s
ee any s
trange charges appearing o
n

an author who has wanted t

T
 IT b
 
T

all to Fran McCullough because I wanted s
ome e
x Ln-
ation as t
o why t
he book had been put off until May.  From the
i s
ound of
 
t
hings, it's been a horror story of the f
irst degree.  I c
an only offer
 
y
ou my s
ympathies.  I
t's a complicated book, but jea11y thincs h
ave been
 
'
retty horrendous.
 
Fran tells me that the f
inished product i
s t
o be a really good-lookinn
 
book, and I
'm g
lad to hear it.  I
'm in s
earch of material to s
end t
o i
n
 
l
and, f
or word of the work has trickled over there. ,
However, s
ince t
h?, 
book i
s t
o be a b
ang-up job, I think I prefer to wait until f
inished
 
books are available rather than send s
bme s
ort of mish-mash over t
here.
 
I
've asked Fran t
o g
ive me a run-down on the promotion p

her c
apsuled description, they s
ound good and I
'm g
lad you were able t

f they c

alk about

 had mentioned to her s
omething about children's books
 
being c
ulled f
rom t

he told me that the two of you had
 
h
ad a t
alk about ghost s

T

Thank you for your l
etter about Bessie's bill problems.
 
Apparently the accounting department sends such bills
 
to authors as a matter of course.  If the author wishes
 
to charge the purchase against his/her royalty account,
 
that's fine and they will take  note of that, but they
 
send the bill so that when a deduction is made from
 
the royalty payment the author can see exactly  *tat
 
the deduction was made for.
 
In any case,  don't worry  about the bill -
-
 the charge
 
will be made against royalties as Bessie wishes.

Dear Bess,
 
I
'm s
orry to have missed you when you c
alled, f
or it would
 
have been n
ice to have s
ome chat with you.
 
I c
an well understand t
hat you would be c
oncerned about the
 
billing of those books that Bessie Jones ordered.  I
've
 
d
iscussed the whole s
ituation with Alice Rosengard, who i
s
 
Fran's assistant.  She's been helpful and in turn has been
 
trying t
o s
traighten t
hings o
ut with the accounting people - 
one Sylvia T
imourian.
 
I
t's their understanding at Harpers that t
hings have been
 
s
traightened out.  I
n other words any books ordered by Bessie
 
are t
o be charged t
o her royalty account, and any books ordered
 
by you will be charged t
o your account.  Books s
ent to the
 
office here will be charged 50/50 t
o e
ach of you, f
or that's
 
regarded a
s regular book expense.  Any of those books we'd be
 
using f
or s
ubsidiary s
ales,etc.
 
As t
o whether the system stands up is a different matter, and
 
I
've a
lerted her and our own accountant that come the next
 
royalty reckoning we s
hould all t
ake a very good c
lose hard
 
l
ook at how t
hese books are being accounted f
or.  O
ur accountant
 
i
s away at the moment, but I
'll tell her too in an effort t
o
 
pull a
ll this t
ogether.
 
I
f you have any queries yourself, don't hesitate to s
hip them
 
back t
o us.  O
bviously, you s
houldn't be s

Dear Josephine:
 
I am thrusting upon you (under separate cover) a manuscript I
'd
 
like to consult you about.  Actually, it's my M.A. thesis written
 
several years ago for the University of California, Berkeley, and
 
preserved there for future generations on microfilm.  It was a
 
jeu d'esprit -
 written with my academic tongue firmly in my aca—
 
demic cheek -
 but I've delivered several talks since (
both to
 
scholarly and lay audiences) on the topic and the reaction has
 
been such that I think that I should do something more with the
 
material. People seem to be really interested.
 
The question is what? It seems to me it either has to be boiled
 
down or fattened up; (in both cases, some of the obvious M.A.
 
thesis type of writing has to be redone).  I
've thought of going
 
two different routes: shortening it and making it the lead essay
 
in a book of essays on childrena folklore; I have several other
 
pieces that could be included and could do more.
 
The other strategy -
 and the one which appeals to me more
 would
 
be to put in another few months' research and try to get it pub-.
 
lished as a i
rn ll book all by itself, perhaps through the monograph
 
series of a university publishing firm or through one of those
 
small houses that specialize in odd books on odd topics.  I think
 
the reason I am currently leaning towards this alternative is that
 
the whole fun of the thing, it seems to me, is the spectacle of
 
how far you can go playing around with a single folkloric item;
 
it's kind of a miniature twentieth—century Golden Bou(h 
very
 
old—fashioned but kind of a kick.
 It could be sub—tit ed "A
 
Folklorist's Journey" or something of the kind.
 
By the way, Fran has aeon it.  I left it overnight after I
'd dropped
 
by to see her this summer, and the topic had come up.  I think she
 
rather prefers alternative number one, but we really didn't discuss
 
it thoroughly; we'd been talking more sociably than professionally.
 
Anyway, I
'd appreciate your reaction -
 also please return the manu—
 
script as I
'm not proposing it be shown farther than your office and
 
I
'd like to have the copy back for revision.  I am on sabbatical
 
this year and hope pretty soon to have my decks clear enough for some
 
real writing, so I hope you can get around to looking it over soon.
 
Cordially,

You must have t

whatsoever.  Now belatedly s
he has s

I s
uppose I am asking you whether you have any c
onvincing
 
arguments and ammunition which I can try to wield in an
 
effort to get STEP IT DOWN into paper.  I
f we c
an't convince
 
Harper to do t
heir own edition, then possibly we might get
 
s
ome o

o do it.  However, I rather
 
think that Harper should do a better job if it's school t

f
olklore world both, maybe you could provide some convincing
 
argument.  I hope s

After having ;

hate to bring the whole matter up, but I should l
ike to order ten (

of Step It Down which could be charted to my royalties, or for which I will
 
remit a check, or if preferable will bring to i

will drop me a note telling me how this mègtii more properly be done, I shall
 
be glad to do better next time.
 I am sure you're not the one who ought to
 
be bothered with sucn re quests, but I can't quite make but who should be.
 
I
'm enclosing for your interest a piece I finished up recently; perhaps I
 
showed it to you before, I

compliments.
 I plan to be in New York during the month of January; perhaps
 
we could have lunch together.

Dear Josephine:
 
Concerning the enclosed bill for Bessie Jones, I would suggest
 
taking the problem up with Fran McCullough at Harpers.  She told
 
a  quite clearly -
 and I imagine she told Bessie too -
-
 that
 
hors' copies could be charged to royalty accounts.
 I
've just
 
ceived a whopping bill from Harpers and am about to write them
 
ck and point this out insofar as my own case is concerned.
 
far as Bessie goes, my private advice to Harpers would be to
 
iiro  themselves a lot of time and postage money and jus t make 
ssie an
. exception.  I mean, they can harass me and eventually
 
will pay up, since I have money in the bank and a middle-class
 
s1ike of owing money, neither of which apply to Bessie who will
 
: ply never be able to locate $142.50 all at one time.  And if
 
she did, how would she convey it to Harpers?  So far as I am aware,
 
she has no checking account; they pay cash on the barrel-head in
 
;
aint Simons. Personally, I do not believe Harpers has a prayer
 
if a chance of collecting this bill short of taking Bessie to
 
art; I
'd suggest they charge this one up to experience and to
 
L
i r royalty account and write her a letter saying their policy
 
s changed (which it apparently has) and she can no longer charge
 
her royalty account in future.
 
i
 for new books, I have a sort of strange possibility in the works/

assume that the books .
bessie orders are for her, and
one.
 
order are for me.  I ordered quite a number last spring and
 
another batch several weeks before Christmas, 1972; and th"
 
is all.  Since we're in different parts of the c
c
 
shouldn't be difficult to tell which is for whom.
 
Maybe, though, it would be a good idea to write
 
and point out to her that these books are being charged ag.:
 
her royalty account and are thus not exactly "free".  She h
'
 
already been told this, of course, by me as well as others;
 
it likely wouldn't hurt to remind her again.  I
'm sending t
 
i
tatement you just mailed me back with this letter: I shouJ
 
think it might

 I
 
I

If this messes things aj

 cu
t
 u kJ .L L
i :
 
please let me know; and I
'll try to suggest another arrangemert.
 
In the meantime, just to spell it all out, I do not want to b
 
charged for Bessie's books; she is concertizing all over the c
 
and is thus in a position to sell lots of books and this is all
 
well and proper, but I would rather keep my own royalty account
 
separate and distinct.
 
Thanks very much for keeping an eye on this situation.  ActuaL
 
I find it rather surprising.  Doesn't Harper and Rowe have t-.
 
with this"  '

"ear Mrs. Hawes:
 
For your information I
'm enclosing a bill from Harpers f
or
 
50 copies of STEP IT DOWN which were ordered by Bessie
 
Jones.
 
According to Harpex3s
 letter of October 9th, 1
972, this
 
is strictly for your information and will be charged
 
against the royalty account.
 
It would be helpful however, if you could let us know
 
if all of these copies were for Bessie Jones, or if
 
any of them were for you, as we will have to alert our
 
accounting department to make s
ure that royalties are
 
deducted from the correct account.
 
With best wishes.
 
Sincerely,

I am enclosing a letter from your business office ;
ihicn r
ch
 
me at long last from our slightly bemused treasurer; does Par
 
and Row want to get me fired or something?  I am also enclssin
 
a letter sent me by Josephine Rogers' secretary (xeroxe ) pus:
 
my response (xeroxed) in which Itried to straighten out the
 
ficul -ty.
 Since I can't conceive'
hat point the confusion
 
trising, it's rather hard for me to know what I can do about
 -  
It does all seem to me that the situation boils down to bi f
li n
 
me (in person) for those books I order and billing Be::
 
those books she orders, or am I being com
pl etely naivc
 
One further thought occurs to me.
 Does the difficult,r re clue
 
around charging the books to Bessie's and my royalty accounts?
 
Is there no way of doing this more or less automatically?  Su
I
.j
 
a clever book—keeper or a creative computer could cope with thkn
 
problem; or do all other authors pay Harpers cash on the barrc
 
head for the copies of their books that they fob off on fr erun
 
are reviewers?  Are we the only sinners in your
 able':
 
In any event, please do what you can to get and kce1 y  r
 
office o
my University treasurer's back.  He is not
 cocally
 
interested in childrens games, has never read the book, a
rid can  
'

I
've been talking to the accounting people here to see what
 
solution we can come up with so as to keep straight youes
 
and Bessie's book purchases.
 
As things stand Harper is charging everything against
 
royalties.
 As long as Bessie goes around ordering books
 
in the amount of $600 there aren't going to be any royalties
 
paid out to anyone.  Obviously this isn't fair to you.
 
I hadn't realized that Bessie was selling these books she
 
ordered.  That being the case I think there is nothing for
 
it but that Bessie pay each time she orders books.
 It's too
 
much to expect Harpers to keep straight who is ordering
 
books and subtract the right amount from the right account.
 
Shall I write Bessie accordingly? And so instruct Harper?
 
Sincerelyq
