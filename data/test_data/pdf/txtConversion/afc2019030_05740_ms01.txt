LG: 
Okay, my name is Lisa Gabbert; today is February 24th, 2020. And today I am 
interviewing Dr. Sean Runnels, in his home in Salt Lake City, for the Physician Oral 
History Project as part of the Library of Congress. 
 
 
Thank you so much for talking with me today.

SR: 
You’re welcome; thank you for interviewing me. 
 
LG: 
And you know you’re being recorded? 
 
SR: 
I do. 
 
LG: 
Okay. For the record, can you state your birth year please? 
 
SR: 
Yeah, it’s 1966. 
 
LG: 
1966, okay. And can you give me your specialty and title? 
 
SR: 
I’m an anesthesiologist, and my title is Associate Professor, and then I’m also the CEO of 
a medical device company. 
 
LG: 
Okay. 
 
SR: 
So, that’s a title that got added on a few years ago. 
 
LG: 
And that’s Associate Professor at the University of –  
 
SR: 
At the University of Utah –  
 
LG: 
Utah. 
 
SR: 
Correct. 
 
LG: 
Great. 
 
SR: 
Department of Anesthesiology. 
 
LG: 
Great, thank you. 
 
 
So, let’s start off with kind of an easy question – how did you decide to become a doctor? 
 
SR: 
So, I originally thought I was going to go into law. And I worked as a paralegal, and it 
became quickly apparent to me that lawyers were always in conflict, and that that bled 
over into the way they interacted with human beings. And I was looking for something 
where, number one, I had a profession that nobody could take away from me (that was 
always needed, no matter where I was); and number two, where it was a win-win 
situation, and that I wasn’t in conflict.  
 
 
I had a family friend that I grew up with and his dad was a  pediatrician, and he seemed 
to really enjoy what he did. We didn’t have any physicians in our family, so he was the 
Physician Oral History: Dr. Sean Runnels 
Page 3 
 
only physician I knew. And he seemed to be a pretty happy guy, so that was kind of how 
I ended up in medicine. 
 
LG: 
Did you ever talk to him about it? 
 
SR: 
No. 
 
LG: 
Or ask his advice, or anything? 
 
SR: 
Not at all [laughs]. No, it’s interesting – I never once talked to him about medicine. He 
just really enjoyed what he did and I could see that.  
 
[02:04] 
 
LG: 
Can you talk a little bit about your process of getting into medical school? 
 
SR: 
Yeah, so I initially thought I wanted to go to law school; and once I decided that I wanted 
to go to medical school, then I transferred to Pacific Lutheran University, because they 
had a high acceptance rate to medical school (from what I heard). And really focused my 
last three – I wasn’t a very great student up until then. And then once I knew what I 
wanted to do, then I really focused on it and spent two and a half years just getting all my 
sciences together, and organic chemistry, and really focusing on getting in medical school 
and getting some research done.  
 
 
And then took my MCATs, and applied for schools; and got wait-listed at a couple, got 
accepted at a couple, and then came off the waitlist at my state school in Oregon. And it 
was a no-brainer, one was $50,000 a year, and Oregon was $8,[000]. And so, I decided 
I’d go to Oregon. 
 
LG: 
That sounds like a wise decision. 
 
SR: 
And medical schools are like pizza: they’re all pretty good. 
 
LG: 
Yeah [laughs]. 
 
SR: 
So, I decided to – and that was by the advice of another physician, who said, “It’s all so 
regulated now that you’re going to do fine, no matter where you go.” 
 
LG: 
And so, what medical school was that? 
 
SR: 
Oregon Health Sciences –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
SR: 
In Portland, Oregon. 
 
Physician Oral History: Dr. Sean Runnels

LG: 
And what year did you enter? 
 
SR: 
I entered in ’91. 
 
LG: 
’91, okay. 
 
SR: 
And then I exited in ’97; so, I did six years through medical school. I did a year where I 
was a pathology intern, while I was a medical student (so, that was a sub-specialty year). 
And then I did a year where I traveled overseas and did a little bit of medical work, but 
mostly just kind of took a year off and traveled in Asia. 
 
LG: 
Nice, nice. Can you describe a little bit, or talk about your time in medical school? 
 
SR: 
Yeah. So, I actually really enjoyed medical school. I was also advised by the same 
physician that if you end in the top third of your class, that that’s good enough to get 
wherever you want. And trying to get in the top like one to two percent, or five percent of 
your class is three times as much work, and it doesn’t really – other than attaining the 
status of the number – it doesn’t really prepare you any better for residency, or treating 
patients, or being a healer. And so I took that advice. 
 
[04:40] 
 
 
In Oregon, I was on the old curriculum, which meant that we did blocks by organ system. 
And what that meant was you could – you had a test at the end of every month that you 
needed to pass and that was what your entire grade was based on. So, if you were a 
learner that could learn from books, then there was no need to go to class. And if you 
were a learner that learned from class and books, then you needed to go to class. 
 
 
So I was a learner that could learn from books (mostly, only) and I didn’t find the lectures 
all that stimulating. And so, actually I had kind of an unusual first couple of years – there 
was another friend who was also, you know – he was actually top of the class, and he was 
also a book learner – and so we spent a lot of time backpacking and kayaking and being 
outside. 
 
LG: 
[Laughs] 
 
SR: 
And you know, reading textbooks, but not being in class. So, I enjoyed medical school; I 
didn’t get too stressed out by – you know, it’s a lot of work: you still have to drink from 
the firehose. But I didn’t get too obsessive about the whole thing: where my class rank 
was, or how I did on my boards. And I did fine. 
 
LG: 
I’ve had a lot of people use that expression: “Drink from the firehose.” 
 
SR: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
Can you explain that for me? 
Physician Oral History: Dr. Sean Runnels 
Page 5 
 
 
SR: 
So, yeah – it’s an expression that you get introduced to in medical school. And basically, 
you have to memorize a ton of information; very little of it is going actually to be used in 
your clinical practice (in the end). But it’s more of a body of knowledge that you need to 
master to get into – some of it is very useful for perspective, but a lot of it is just 
grooming. And you know, you could easily (instead of organic chemistry) say, “We need 
you to learn advanced Chinese, and you need to master 2,500 characters.” Some of it is 
just an initiation ritual. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
SR: 
Is what I think. 
 
[06:53] 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
SR: 
Into the priesthood of being a physician. 
 
LG: 
What was your favorite part about medical school, would you say? 
 
SR: 
My favorite part about medical school was my pathology year. I did a year of pathology, 
which was an extra year of medical school but I was effectively a pathology intern; and 
so, I looked at a lot of slides, did a lot of autopsies.  
 
 
But what it meant was that I also met with a lot of the surgeons and the medicine docs, to 
help them with tissue diagnosis and lab diagnoses. And what it did is it helped me put 
together all of the balkanized stuff I had learned, because the pathologists, you know, the 
joke is they know everything, they just know it two days too late –  
 
LG: 
[Laughs] 
 
SR: 
(For the patient) – but they really do understand how the disease process fits into the 
context of the whole patient’s pathology; where the renal doc would know, you know, the 
kidneys, but he might not (or she might not) understand like how that fits in with the 
lungs, and that kind of thing. But the pathologist actually gets to see all of the pathology, 
and really – you also have time to read –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
SR: 
Because you’re not doing patient care, you’re not writing a lot of notes; and so, I would 
read slide trays – where I’m looking at the tissue, and then I could (when I had something 
that I wanted to find out more about) there was a book right above my desk and I could 
dig into the book. And then at the end of the day I’d go over all of that with my attending. 
And so, it was a fantastic year for really putting it all together and learning. And it should 
be part of everybody’s years in med school. But so, I took that opportunity.  
Physician Oral History: Dr. Sean Runnels 
Page 6 
 
 
LG: 
Yeah. 
 
SR: 
And did that year. That was my favorite year. 
 
LG: 
Nice. What about – so, you did a lot of autopsies and –  
 
SR: 
Um-hmm. 
 
LG: 
And pathology – did you have to take (also) gross anatomy? Or did those two things –  
 
SR: 
Yeah, so you take gross anatomy (at least in the old curricula that I was on) – and I think 
this is still mostly true – gross anatomy is the first thing you take in medical school. And 
I think it’s – like I don’t think that vivisection via computer and things will ever replace 
that, because it serves a couple purposes: you get to feel the tissue, which if you’re going 
into surgery, you’ve got to be able to feel tissue.  
 
 
You also get to see the relationships, and then actually tactilely move the organs around, 
so that you can kind of understand how they work in a dynamic setting. You also can 
explore a little bit more than you can with computer vivisection.  
 
 
But I think maybe the most important thing, or at least another whole issue that comes 
along with (that’s being dealt with) is you need to be able to distance yourself some from 
the patients that you’re going to be interacting with. Because you know, it sounds – I 
think from maybe a lay perspective it sounds really cold; but you just can’t treat 
everybody like they’re your grandma –  
 
[10:08] 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
SR: 
Or you’ll just go nuts. You just can’t – there’s no way to see the suffering and see, you 
know, families that are losing an 18-year-old daughter of cancer, and be able to actually 
function if you don’t see that patient as a patient. And part of seeing them as a patient is 
breaking them down into organ systems, into tissue pathology, that kind of thing. You 
just – you know, I think it’s really necessary to be able to do that.  
 
 
And so, gross anatomy does that: you take a human being, and you, you know, literally 
and figuratively break them apart into organ systems. And I think that ritual is why gross 
anatomy is always going to be there. It’s currently the way we do that.  
 
LG: 
Yeah, yeah. 
 
SR: 
In medicine. 
 
Physician Oral History: Dr. Sean Runnels 
Page 7 
 
LG: 
Yeah, that makes sense. Well when we get to your current practice I’d like to come back 
to that idea –  
 
SR: 
Sure. 
 
LG: 
About how do you distance yourself from patients –  
 
SR: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
For emotional purposes.  
 
 
What was the most difficult thing about medical school? 
 
SR: 
That very same thing: the way it made you treat your family differently. Because you’re 
distancing yourself from human beings, and so – so, like when my mom would, you 
know, she had MS, and so she would talk to me about MS; and I could no longer just, 
you know, listen and say, “Yeah, gosh; it’s really bad.” You know, you had to get in – 
she wanted to know about diagnoses and tissues and things like, you know, how it 
affected her.  
 
 
And so, that was something I purposely never really did was learn anything about MS – I 
got an “F” in MS, because I didn’t want to treat my mom as a patient. I didn’t want to 
have her as a patient in my mind, I wanted her to be my mom. And so, those kind of 
things. They’re really pretty subtle.  
 
[12:00] 
 
 
The other thing is the tempo of medical school is so high, and it demands such, you 
know, really short communication and answers. I couldn’t – my mom would – I’d ask her 
a question and she’d kind of give me a wandering answer. And it’s like, “Could you just 
answer the question, mom?” 
 
LG: 
[Laughs] 
 
SR: 
You know? Because it’s hard to change pace, and you know, step into a world where 
people are talking about emotions and things like that. Because you know, physicians 
really don’t care about emotions, especially when you’re in med school and you don’t 
have any perspective: you’re very focused on all the tissue.  
 
 
So, I think that was probably the hardest thing, is the way it affected your relationships 
with non-physicians.  
 
 
 
You know, you were being clocked off into a group of physicians, and going through an 
initiation ritual where you really – if you weren’t careful, you could be pretty arrogant. 
And you know, it’s kind of like being a priest or something else – you’re just separating 
yourself from society and starting to join a club. 
Physician Oral History: Dr. Sean Runnels 
Page 8 
 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. And were aware of that process as it was happening? Or is that more 
retrospectively that you’re sort of –  
 
SR: 
I would say – I mean, I felt it happening, but I wasn’t aware of what was happening. I 
could feel the results of it, or the side effects of it, but I didn’t have any idea about, you 
know, any of – no. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
SR: 
Yeah, I knew something was happening, but I didn’t know what was happening.  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm, and you were pretty young when you went in? 
 
SR: 
No, I was 25. 
 
LG: 
Oh, were you? 
 
SR: 
So, I had to actually –  
 
LG: 
Okay. 
 
SR: 
Yeah, I did the rules of sixes in my life: so, I did six years of undergrad (but I spent a 
year where I was crew on a sailboat), and so, I took a year off there; and then I had 
another year where I worked as a paralegal (to pay for the last part of my college). 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
[14:00] 
 
SR: 
And then I did six years of medical school. And then we try to take every sixth year off 
and do a sabbatical of some kind (as a family). 
 
LG: 
Nice. 
 
SR: 
So, I guess it turns out to be the rules of sixes. 
 
LG: 
Yeah [inaudible]. 
 
SR: 
Yeah, I was a little bit older when I entered medical school. 
 
LG: 
I see. Well can you talk about your residency a little bit? 
 
SR: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
How you decided to go into anesthesiology? 
Physician Oral History: Dr. Sean Runnels 
Page 9 
 
 
SR: 
Yep. 
 
LG: 
And what that residency was like? 
 
SR: 
Yeah, so initially I was going to go into pathology. And I did a surgical internship, 
because I wanted to be an anatomic pathologist, where you look at a lot of tissue coming 
out of the operating room. And so, understanding the surgery, and the surgical 
environment was important to me; and I thought surgery would be a really fun year to do.  
 
 
And so, I did that and it was a ton of fun. It was probably the most fun year of my 
training. It was grueling and hard – we worked 90 to 100 hours, but there’s a real 
comradery with your colleagues, and I was really good at it and enjoyed the pace and 
enjoyed being tired and kind of all of that stuff.  
 
 
And I thought I wanted – I realized I didn’t want to be a pathologist because I wanted to 
have some practical skills –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
SR: 
And I knew that I wanted to work overseas (or I thought I wanted to work overseas in the 
future). And so, about three-quarters of the way through the year, one of the surgery 
interns dropped out, and so I was doing what’s called a “prelim year,” where there was no 
intent to go on to surgery. And the chair asked if I wanted to, you know, fill his spot and 
offered me a job. And I said, “Well I’ll think about it.”  
 
 
And then I went in on Friday, to say, “Yeah, I’ll take the job.” And he was already gone 
for the day. And then I had my golden weekend, which I saw – not my wife at the time, 
but my wife to be – and we spend the weekend together. And I thought, “Oh, my god. 
Wait a minute! I’m not going to do surgery.”  
 
 
And I looked around and you know, nobody was – everybody was happy in the operating 
room and in the hospital – but their lives were disasters outside, you know: their kids 
were messed up and they were on their second or third wife. And they were kind of, you 
know, sometimes assholes in the OR –  
 
[16:22] 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
SR: 
And I could feel that pull, and I didn’t think that I could do that and not become an 
asshole. And so, I just – I ended up looking around for anesthesia jobs and found an 
anesthesia slot and slipped into that. So, that’s how I kind of ended up there.  
 
Physician Oral History: Dr. Sean Runnels 
Page 10 
 
 
And I also looked around when I was – I looked around said, “OK, who does have their 
life together? Who is happy in the world, as far as physicians go?” And it seemed to be 
the radiologist, the pathologists, and the anesthesiologists.  
 
 
And you know, for anesthesia, it was clear that everybody was happy to see them when 
they come to the labor ward, the patients are like, “Please, you know, put an epidural in 
me. Thank you so much.” When you go to the ED, because everything’s falling apart, the 
ED docs are happy to see you. The surgeons are happy to see you.  
 
 
And they were the ones that could come in and pretty much stabilize and temporize any 
situation. And they couldn’t necessarily definitively fix the problem, but you could save a 
patient that was dying, right away. And so, that’s how I ended up saying anesthesia.  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. Well anesthesia also works pretty closely with OR –  
 
SR: 
Um-hmm. 
 
LG: 
So, it’s sort of –  
 
SR: 
Um-hmm. 
 
LG: 
You know, keeps that –  
 
SR: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
Interest in the OR –  
 
SR: 
Yep. 
 
LG: 
That you had, too. 
 
SR: 
Yeah, and it was – you know, I loved the OR culture: you’re working with the best and 
the brightest of the people in the hospital. The most responsive, capable people are in the 
operating room, because there’s very little margin for error. And there’s a lot of 
teamwork, and so I liked that part. I just didn’t like the –  
 
 
Well I loved being an intern, and being involved and tired all the time, but I didn’t see 
that as a sustainable way of life.  
 
LG: 
Right. 
 
SR: 
And so, little did I know that anesthesiologists worked just as much. 
 
[Laughter] 
 
Physician Oral History: Dr. Sean Runnels 
Page 11 
 
 
The whole idea that oh, we’re done at five is ridiculous. It turns out we’re there whenever 
the surgeons are there.  
 
LG: 
Of course. 
 
SR: 
Yeah. 
 
[18:23] 
 
LG: 
Can you talk about your residency then?  
 
SR: 
Yeah. So, yeah – residency I –  
 
LG: 
Where did you go? 
 
SR: 
University of Utah. So, I came to the University of Utah. And when I started, there was a 
dip in people going into anesthesia and into orthopedics. It was during the Clinton years, 
and there was some – I don’t know what triggered it, but there was a rumor that Medicare 
was not going to reimburse radiology, anesthesiology, or orthopedics. And that 
everything was going to an HMO. 
 
LG: 
[Inaudible] 
 
SR: 
And all of those jobs were basically going to disappear. And I don’t know who started 
that rumor, or how it – I don’t know any of the details. But what the medical students did, 
was they just quit applying for those residencies for a couple of years. And so, those are 
traditionally some of the hardest to get into, and suddenly you could just call a place up –  
 
 
Like, I called up the University of Utah, because I thought Salt Lake would be a good 
place to live, and do a residency, and they had a reputation as a decent program. And they 
said, “Oh, you can speak English, that’s great. Come on down.” They paid for my trip 
here, they put me up in the Marriott. I interviewed for a day and met people; and then at 
the end of the day, the residency director had a contract and said, “Sign here, we’ll give 
you a $500 bonus.” 
 
LG: 
Wow. 
 
SR: 
And so you could just walk into spots. So, when I arrived, it was the last year that that 
was true.  
 
LG: 
What year was that? 
 
SR: 
In ’99, I think – ’99, I think that’s right? Yeah, ’98-’99.  
 
 
And so what happened after that is applications went back up and everything went back 
to normal. But that meant that the people I was training with were a fairly sketchy crew. 
Physician Oral History: Dr. Sean Runnels 
Page 12 
 
There was all sorts of people that had filled those positions – like, there were 
international folks that really couldn’t speak English, that they were just kind of showing 
them where the OR was. It was a really sketchy time for anesthesia; orthopedics as well.  
 
[20:35] 
 
 
My chairman had just stepped down, and so we were without a chairman for two and a 
half years that I was there. And so, it was a pretty loose program. And then we got our 
new chairman, Dr. Cahalan came from UCFS and suddenly [snaps fingers] buttoned 
everything up at the end.  
 
 
But you worked a lot – there were no restrictions on work hours. I think we were working 
anywhere from 80 to 95 hours a week; and some weeks you’d work over 100 hours. And 
there wasn’t a lot of coddling – not that, you know, I’m not encouraging long work hours 
[chuckles] at all – they’re not good for anybody.  
 
 
But you know, just like it was very calloused to, you’re a resident, and you work, and 
that’s what you do. And you just get the shaft all the time. And you just expected that, so 
it wasn’t hard to – it wasn’t emotionally hard, but it was, you were very tired all the time.  
 
 
Like when I finished – I took three months off when I finished; and after a month I had 
actually caught up on my sleep, and I was like, “Oh, my god – this is what it’s like to 
actually be awake during the day.” You know? If I wasn’t focused, I’d just be drifting, 
you know: going off to sleep when I was a resident. 
 
LG: 
Can you – because I know for non-medical people it’s sort of unimaginable –  
 
SR: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
To think about an 80 to 100 hour work week – can you describe a little bit in detail, like 
how does that actually work? 
 
SR: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
Logistically. 
 
SR: 
Logistically, it means that you leave at anywhere from 10:00 to 12:00 at night, and then 
you’re back in the hospital between 4:30 and 5:00 in the morning. And that just 
repetitively goes on, over and over and over.  
 
 
And then every third night, you’re on-call. So, you get to the hospital at, you know, 5:30 
or 6:00, and then you stay until 7:00 or 8:00 the next morning, and then you go home and 
sleep. And then you come the morning after that; and then you don’t come in that day or 
night: you get 24 hours off. And then you come in and work a day again from maybe 
6:00 to 10:00 or 12:00 at night. And then you go home, go to sleep, come back at six. 
And then you work the whole next day again. 
Physician Oral History: Dr. Sean Runnels 
Page 13 
 
 
 
And it just goes on and on and on. And you’re tired, but what it really does to your life is 
all you do is work. You know, you really – you don’t have time to clean house, you don’t 
have time to go out to dinner. You just work. And all of your relationships happen in the 
hospital. 
 
[23:31] 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
SR: 
You know? You really get isolated. And then when you do have time off, people do – I’d 
say 80% of the people that are residents, you know, were young and they want to get out 
and do something. So, you go do crazy stuff – and you’re just backpacking, or you know, 
on the fly doing something all week long to try and jam in the rest of the year; or you just 
sleep. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
SR: 
Or you do both. 
 
LG: 
Extremes [laughs]. 
 
SR: 
Yeah, it’s all about extremes, right? 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
SR: 
And then you know, it’s very difficult for people who are in relationships. I think this is 
why so many relationships happen with other doctors or nurses – is because that’s who 
you’re exposed to. You know, that is your social – you’re getting all your social time at 
work. You know, doctors marry nurses because that’s, you know, 99% of the people 
you’re around (that are females if you’re a male) are nurses, or other, you know, other 
doctors. And so, that’s – it’s just more of a tradition, that’s who you are around. 
 
 
And then the other thing is that doctors are the only other folks that can really understand, 
oh, I get it – you’ve been up for 24 hours, it’s okay to be cranky, or why don’t you just go 
to bed? 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
SR: 
And even, you know, nurse-doctor relationships have that trouble. But my wife’s an 
OB/GYN, so that’s probably the only specialty that’s worse than surgery or anesthesia as 
far as work hours. And so, you know, that’s – she could understand that, and we 
survived. Because I think a lot of marriages survive –  
 
 
You know, I have a friend who got divorced recently – he’s an anesthesiologist. His 
wife’s very nice, but I remember a conversation he came home after 12 hours in the OR, 
Physician Oral History: Dr. Sean Runnels 
Page 14 
 
and she was like, “Oh, you’ve got to do this, or that, or the other thing.” And he just 
wanted to have a beer and watch tv. And she was like, “Look, all you do is sit all day,” –  
 
LG: 
Right. 
 
SR: 
And you know, “You’re just sitting in an OR.” But what she doesn’t understand is 
actually, you know, the weight of like, that patient is literally three minutes away from 
arrest the entire time that they’re asleep, and we’re breathing for them. If anything 
happens, you know, and you don’t get it right in the next three minutes, that patient has a 
catastrophic outcome. And so it’s that pressure.  
 
[25:52] 
 
 
And there’s a lot, you know; it’s fast-paced, you’re working with surgeons, there’s a lot 
of emotional things going on in the OR, and a lot of social hierarchy that has to be 
navigated. And it’s an exhausting job: emotionally exhausting. That’s a hard thing for lay 
people to understand, I think. And when I say lay people – there it is, we’re the 
priesthood. 
 
LG: 
Non-medical, yeah. 
 
SR: 
[Laughing] 
 
LG: 
Yeah. 
 
SR: 
They’re lay people – the non-medical people who are not really responsible for, you 
know – a surgeon, if you nick their aorta, the patient dies. Like you can’t make errors; 
there is no small error.  
 
 
In anesthesia, surgery – the specialties that are right at the edge of like, of causing death, 
or causing immense harm in a patient: neurosurgery, cardiac surgery, cardiac anesthesia, 
anesthesia, OB/GYNs, you know, where you’re three minutes away from really harming 
somebody irreparably – it does take a toll on you. And you don’t see it when you’re 
working in the milieu because it’s all so – But you know, emotionally your sub-conscious 
still gets it; and certainly your adrenal glands are firing off.  
 
 
My wife got me this watch that takes my stress level. Usually at home it’s about 55 –  
 
LG: 
Like a Fitbit or something? 
 
SR: 
Yeah, it’s like a Fitbit. And when I’m working in the OR, you know, it’s yeah – it’s like 
85/95 –  
 
LG: 
[Laughing] 
 
SR: 
And I don’t look stressed, and I don’t feel stressed. 
Physician Oral History: Dr. Sean Runnels 
Page 15 
 
 
LG: 
Right. 
 
SR: 
But it’s just a high-paced, stressful environment. And so – yeah. 
 
LG: 
Can you talk a little bit about the details – I mean, not the physiological details –  
 
SR: 
Um-hmm? 
 
LG: 
But the details of what you do as an anesthesiologist? 
 
SR: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
That contributes to that stress or that responsibility? 
 
SR: 
Yeah; so, I mean – a lot of it is kind of physiologic details. So, anesthesia is unusual – in 
fact, it’s unique because we take people –  
 
[28:00] 
 
 
You know, I guess I’ll step back a second. You know, the very simple model for what a 
human is doing is they’re consuming fuel, they’re consuming oxygen; we’re internal 
combustion engines, you know. If you can think of yourself as just a big candle flame.  
 
 
There’s glucose going in, which is the fuel; there’s oxygen that is coming from the air 
around us, that constantly has to be delivered to your tissue, which is just a billion little 
candle flames. And then you make ATP, which makes all your cells work. You make 
CO2, which you breath out [exhales], and a little bit of water and heat. And so, we’re just 
flames: we’re just a combustion process. And humans (just like a candle flame) – if you 
cut off the oxygen supply, the flame dwindles and then goes out.  
 
 
And so, you’re really, really good at delivering oxygen. You’ve never had more than a 
three minute disruption or all your little flames in your brain would go out and your brain 
would die. And your mom, before she had you, never had a three-minute disruption. And 
her mom, before she had her, never had a three-minute disruption.  
 
 
And so, you can picture a line of all of your evolutionary ancestors, back to whatever you 
think started the spark of life – it has had continuous oxygen delivery throughout.  
 
 
So, anesthesiologists take that – somebody like you, who has zero oxygen-delivery 
problems, and we put a Bell jar over you. And we put a Bell jar over you that we need to 
lift in a three-minute timeframe, or your little flame will go out. And the first flames to go 
out are the ones in your brain and your brain cells die.  
 
Physician Oral History: Dr. Sean Runnels 
Page 16 
 
 
And so every time we give somebody a medicine and we make them apneic, or we make 
them stop breathing, we have three minutes to get oxygen to their lungs again or they 
have a cardiac arrest.  
 
 
And so, when we’re delivering anesthesia, the patients are paralyzed – so, they can’t 
breathe without us breathing for them; or we have given them drugs that just make them 
stop breathing; or we’ve given them drugs so that their tongue kind of falls back and 
blocks their airway. All of those things mean that no oxygen is getting delivered to their 
lungs.  
 
[30:15] 
 
 
Now we’re doing that in perfectly healthy people. And so, you know, from the weight of 
what we do (perspective) – we’re not only responsible for that single patient that’s in 
front of us, we’re responsible for everything back in their evolutionary line that delivered 
oxygen to get that patient in front of us.  
 
 
And no other specialty electively interrupts oxygen delivery. That’s it. We’re the only 
one that does it.  
 
 
The other specialties that intubate or make people apneic are doing it in response to the 
patient already has an oxygen-delivery problem. The ED, the ICU – those are patients 
that are about to have a cardiac arrest because they have oxygen-delivery problems; so, 
they can be forgiven if they make a mistake because the patient got shot by an AK-47, or 
they got hit by a bus, or they’re having an MI. And so you can excuse a death there, 
because the patient was on the road to death anyway.  
 
 
For us, we take a 25-year-old mom who is going to have a cesarean section and we 
interrupt her oxygen delivery – we then, can you know, potentially kill the mom and the 
baby in three minutes.  
 
 
And so that’s why we are continuously present in a room, that’s why we’re always on-
point and paying attention to who is delivering oxygen to this patient’s lungs now? 
Because we are constantly – either the patient’s got to be able to take responsibility and 
do that, or we have to be responsible for it. And in any three minute period if we’re not 
paying attention, then the next thing we know the patient can be having a cardiac arrest 
and their brain cells can be dying.  
 
 
And so, that’s what makes it so stressful. Now, we do it every day, and so it’s like 
landing and flying a plane. You know, we can’t be stressed and do our job at the same 
time, as far as, we can’t be physiologically stressed: our heart rate can’t go up, those sorts 
of things. And so we train and it becomes – that’s all part of the process of kind of 
separating yourself from that immense responsibility. But in the back, it’s always there.  
 
[32:23] 
 
Physician Oral History: Dr. Sean Runnels 
Page 17 
 
 
And when it happens, then you know, usually if it happens, it’s happening to somebody 
else and all we say is, “There but for the grace of God, go I.” Because every day we run 
in front of a machine gun –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
SR: 
And if you do it long enough, you and your patient will be shot. We can’t take all the 
bullets out of the belt of the machine gun. But our job is to take as many out every day as 
possible. And so, it’s one of those things that you know eventually there will be a 
problem. I’ll do 30,[000] to 50,000 anesthetics in my life. Because I work at a university, 
people are very sick; and so, I’ll have one or two patients that has an arrest during the 
anesthesia, no matter what I do.  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
SR: 
Just by numbers. And then if I have any errors, or make any mistakes, or am distracted or 
something like that, then it can happen more frequently. And it’s a big deal when it 
happens. I mean, it really – there’s a lot of PTSD around it. And it happens very quickly, 
too; things unwind in the operating room very, very quickly. You know, they don’t 
happen slowly because it’s usually centered around you’re not getting oxygen to the 
lungs, and so it all kind of goes from fine, to –  
 
LG: 
Not fine. 
 
SR: 
Not fine in a three to five-minute period.  
 
LG: 
Wow. 
 
SR: 
And so, yeah – it’s an abrupt change. And then once it happens, then you’re on edge 
because then you realize man, it could happen any time.  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm, um-hmm. How do you deal with that level of responsibility? Or that level of 
stress? Even though there’s a great, you know, obviously the numbers are very small, but 
they have –  
 
SR: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
How do you deal with that as part of your work? 
 
SR: 
Yeah, so I think two things happen: number one, the people that can’t deal with it get 
selected out pretty early –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
Physician Oral History: Dr. Sean Runnels 
Page 18 
 
SR: 
Because they just can’t prioritize, they can’t manage that. And then as you train, you have 
somebody training with you that can keep you out of trouble. And so, you feel safe as 
you’re training, because somebody else ultimately holds that responsibility. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
SR: 
And then there is the part of – I think as you’re training, you know, you’re tired, you’re 
humiliated – not necessarily, well sometimes by your senior colleagues, but you know, 
you’re very humbled during training. And all of that is kind of like breaking you down, 
so that you’re entering a priesthood that gives you – a priesthood (I don’t know what a 
better word is), but –  
 
LG: 
Priesthood is [??] 
 
SR: 
A profession priesthood, whatever – but you’re separate from other people, and you do a 
special thing and that allows you to do that special thing. And when there’s a problem, 
you can just say well, you know, that’s just the way it goes; that’s part of my profession 
and I just have to deal with it. And so, it gives you some protection to be able to function 
every day.  
 
[35:40] 
 
 
You know, if you were a priest and you have to give Last Rites to people, and you don’t 
really believe that the Last Rites are helping that patient (or that person) get into heaven, 
then you’re probably not going to be able to do what you’re do – you have to really kind 
of drink the Kool-Aid to be able to administer to people that are dying all the time.  
 
 
And I think the same thing is true – you have to kind of drink the Kool-Aid, especially 
early in your career, that doctors are somehow immune to this. And then as you practice 
longer, you realize you are not, but you’re just more mature and can kind of understand 
what’s happening. But initially, you just have to kind of drink the Kool-Aid and say, you 
know –  
 
 
And I know you’re interested in humor – humor is a huge part of it. You know, being 
able to blow things off and distance yourself through humor is a massive part of that as 
well. There’s a lot of gallows humor. And people who are humorless just can’t make it in 
medicine – you’ve got to be able to laugh. And you’ve got to be able to laugh in the face 
of, you know, tragedy or you just – I don’t know much else about how we use humor, but 
I know it’s a vital part of getting through the whole process.  
 
LG: 
Can you talk a little bit about it in the OR? 
 
SR: 
Yeah. So, in the OR it is very rare (contrary to popular belief) that there’s much humor 
around like the physical aspects of people. You know, you hear reports of somebody, you 
know, saying, “Oh, the fat pig,” or whatever. Generally, that’s not what the humor is 
about; it’s less about the patient, and more about the situation.  
Physician Oral History: Dr. Sean Runnels 
Page 19 
 
 
 
So a great example is I was with a guy named Hutchinson, who is a hand surgeon, and we 
were in Nicaragua. And we were trying to do this crazy – it’s called a pollicization – to 
replace somebody’s thumb with their toe. (And why we were doing that in Nicaragua is a 
whole different thing: without, you know, the proper resources and everything.)  
 
 
And it was just kind of going on and on, and it wasn’t going very well. And one of the 
things you need for that is a tourniquet that goes up around the patient’s arm, so that it 
cuts off the blood supply so you can do the operation.  
 
[37:58] 
 
 
And so, the operation wasn’t going well, you know, it was just a lot of things that were 
not – it was clear that we were not in an optimal environment to do such a complex 
procedure. But we were soldiering on and trying to get it done. And just as things were 
not going well, the tourniquet exploded – just like [claps hands] boom! 
 
LG: 
No. 
 
SR: 
And pieces went flying everywhere, because you know, it was a Third World tourniquet. 
And Hutch turned to me and he said, “Tourniquet down.” 
 
LG: 
[Laughs] 
 
SR: 
Which is what we say when, you know, we’re done with a successful operation. And it 
was just like: and there it is. And we abandoned the procedure, and –  
 
LG: 
And that was it? 
 
SR: 
And that was it. But you know, we all had a good laugh about that.  
 
LG: 
[Chuckles] 
 
SR: 
It’s like all right, I can’t – yeah, we can’t get around that one.  
 
 
And in that kind of thing, where it’s just matter-of-fact: all right, I think we’ve reached 
the end of whatever.  
 
 
And so, that’s the kind of humor we – people don’t laugh about dead people and people 
don’t laugh about tragic situations, like you know, the 26-year-old who gets run over by a 
dump truck. None of that is funny and people get tears in their eyes.  
 
 
But I think it’s mostly situational, like things that the system– a lot of humor about how 
crappy the system is.  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
Physician Oral History: Dr. Sean Runnels 
Page 20 
 
 
SR: 
Around the EMR, and things like that – things that we’re stuck with. So, I think it’s kind 
of myth that we laugh at people, or we’re – you know, it’s more gallows humor in –  
 
LG: 
In the immediate context? 
 
SR: 
The system – the immediate context that we’re stuck with. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
SR: 
Because if you’re stuck with it then you might as well just get on with things and 
acknowledge it. And I think we sometimes acknowledge things through humor.  
 
LG: 
Yeah. 
 
SR: 
If that makes sense? 
 
LG: 
That’s one of the things that’s come out very much in these interviews –  
 
SR: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
Is how situational and contextual –  
 
SR: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
You know, humor is. 
 
SR: 
I’ve very, very rarely heard anybody say anything derogatory about a patient. 
 
LG: 
Yeah, yeah. 
 
SR: 
You know? 
 
LG: 
Yeah. 
 
SR: 
It just is kind of a myth. 
 
LG: 
What about derogatory statements about – or, not derogatory – humorous statements 
about specialties? 
 
SR: 
Oh, sure; yeah. 
 
LG: 
Anesthesiologists? Or surgeons? 
 
SR: 
Yeah, yeah. There’s all sorts of stereotypes around each specialty, and some are 
absolutely true, for sure. And so, that’s absolutely true.  
Physician Oral History: Dr. Sean Runnels 
Page 21 
 
 
LG: 
What do you hear about anesthesiologists? 
 
[40:35] 
 
SR: 
Oh, so anesthesiologists – that’s interesting; number one, that we don’t really bond with 
our patients, or we’re very much focused on the short-term fix, and that we’re super risk-
adverse.  
 
 
So, the surgeons would joke about you know, oh, the patient – like I got one surgeon (it 
wasn’t much of joke – or I didn’t find it all that funny), but you know, the patient had 
eaten a donut when they were supposed to have their surgery. So, we didn’t cancel the 
case, but we delayed the case because you want people’s stomachs to be empty, so that 
when they go to sleep they don’t regurgitate anything and get it into the lungs, because 
aspiration kills you. 
 
 
And so, one of the surgeons that I – it was an orthopedic surgeon – he was upset that I 
delayed the case. And he said, “Well what does the literature say about mortality for 
eating a donut in the morning?” 
 
 
 
And you know, it’s like well nobody’s done a randomized control trial about that, and 
blah, blah, blah. And so, he tried to use humor. But the interesting thing was I had heard 
that particular schtick before, and it comes from a very small contingent of orthopedic 
surgeons that have trained at an institution (that will not be named) in New York.  
 
 
And so, my question to him was like, “I’ve heard that schtick before. Did you train at X 
institution?” He was like, “Well, yeah – I did.” 
 
LG: 
[Laughs] 
 
SR: 
And I’m like, “Isn’t that interesting that I can tell where you trained by the shit you’re 
feeding me right now.” 
 
LG: 
By that question [laughs]. 
 
SR: 
And yeah, you know, the stereotype of the orthopedic surgeon is they don’t really care 
about anything but the bone they’re going to fix. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
SR: 
Which, you know, may or may not be true.  
 
[42:37] 
 
 
You know, it’ interesting – a lot of the sub-specialties – they take like the crème de la 
crème of – to get into orthopedic –  
Physician Oral History: Dr. Sean Runnels 
Page 22 
 
 
 
Perfect example: when I was a surgery intern I was on trauma service. And I was on with 
one of the orthopedic surgery R2s; and so we had to manage chest tubes, you know, all of 
the trauma service stuff. And then the next month he was back on orthopedic surgery, and 
he’s calling me and saying, “Oh, you guys are going to have to take this patient on your 
service because they have a chest tube.” 
 
 
I’m like, wait a minute, last month you could manage chest tubes –  
 
LG: 
[Laughs] 
 
SR: 
This month you can’t manage a chest tube, and you want us to be the primary service? 
And they’re just, you know, pushing people off their service. But you know, they need to 
do that because they’re busy in the OR, and –  
 
LG: 
Yeah. 
 
SR: 
All those things. So, you know – I think there’s stereotypes; and some are deserved, some 
are not. But most of the actions or the way people behave are not out of arrogance or 
anything like that. It’s the necessary way to behave to be able to actually practice in the 
system we’re in.  
 
 
You know, if you’re an orthopedic surgeon and you’re spending four days a week in the 
operating room then you’re not going to want to deal with somebody in congestive heart 
failure, or even, you know, write an order for that because it’s a distraction from being in 
the operating room and you’re already so overwhelmed. 
 
LG: 
Right. 
 
SR: 
And so, I think that that sometimes gets lost on people.  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
SR: 
But I think most of the docs are good people and they’re just trying to get done what they 
need done. And so, the pressures of your specialty kind of shape the way you behave.  
 
LG: 
That’s true. 
 
SR: 
And that’s kind of like why I didn’t do surgery, because I saw the pressures of general 
surgery, you know, created kind of abrupt, arrogant people.  
 
 
You know, for arrogance is a perfect example of – if you’re a surgeon or an 
anesthesiologist, you need a little bit of arrogance to be able to walk into situations where 
you’re it. I mean, if you walk into a situation and your instant response isn’t, “Yeah, I can 
take care of that.” Get somebody else.  
 
Physician Oral History: Dr. Sean Runnels 
Page 23 
 
[44:47] 
 
LG: 
Right. 
 
SR: 
Because if you freeze, or you think, “I can’t take care of that,” and you’re full of self-
doubt (or even a little bit of self-doubt), you’re not going to be able to serve that patient 
well.  
 
 
And so, there is kind of an arrogance that’s needed to do that. And as you move closer to 
the edge of like, “You’ve got three minutes to get it all right,” you’ve got to get it all 
right.  
 
 
Now, anesthesia is different in that we’re, on the whole, you know, culturally a little bit 
more humble, because somebody’s got to take care of the patient when all of this stuff is, 
you know – shit’s flying in the OR, and people are upset, and things like that. 
Somebody’s actually got to focus on what’s going on.  
 
 
And then we’re a service industry, in that we don’t bring profit to the hospital, or we 
don’t bring patients to the hospital; we allow the surgeons to bring patients to the 
hospital. And I’m not saying we’re not important, but we don’t have a lot of clout when it 
comes to if you get into a battle with a surgeon, like about what’s going on, you’re going 
to lose.  
 
 
Because ultimately the hospital is going to say, “Well, I could either choose to have the 
surgeon be happy or the anesthesiologist be happy.” If the surgeon’s unhappy, he’ll just 
go to another hospital and take his income stream with him. And so you quickly learn 
that that isn’t the proper way to deal with surgeons. And culturally, we try to keep things 
calm in the operating room.  
 
 
And so, you know, we’re all trained (very deliberately) to, when we’re faced with 
conflict to just say, “Oh, I’m sorry, you know, blah, blah, blah, blah.” And we will deal 
with it after the surgery is over. But the first duty in the operating room is to just always 
try to calm things down, so that we can get the surgery done, because that’s in the best 
interest of our patients.  
 
 
And so, in general, we’re not people that are inflamers. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
[46:46] 
 
SR: 
And that’s not always true –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
SR: 
Of other physicians.  
Physician Oral History: Dr. Sean Runnels 
Page 24 
 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm; no, that makes sense. 
 
SR: 
Not sure I want that on tape [laughs], but it’s the reality; yeah. 
 
LG: 
You can go through and edit. 
 
SR: 
And you know, there are some anesthesiologists that will get in your face, but not very 
many. 
 
LG: 
Yeah. 
 
SR: 
You know, generally, it’s just not productive. And usually it’s systems issues, not people 
issues anyway. And so, trying to fix systemic problems on a case by case basis is just 
going to make you sad, and it’s not going to get anything fixed.  
 
LG: 
Well speaking of systems things, and also getting a little bit back to that stress of just 
physicians in general – does the medical system (as you’ve experienced it), does it give 
physicians support for dealing with the stressors of jobs?  
 
SR: 
No, no. 
 
LG: 
Or does it just kind of –  
 
SR: 
Not at all. 
 
LG: 
You’re on your own. 
 
SR: 
You’re on your own. You know, this – right now, I actually really feel strongly about this 
– this idea that physicians need resiliency training –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
SR: 
And that we need to be more present and do, you know, internal calming and stuff. I 
would say of all people out there, physicians are some of the most resilient humans – I 
mean, for the stuff you go through, the hours you keep, what you do with your life and 
your relationships out of dedication to your patients and the profession – it’s judy 
insulting to physicians when administrators say, “Oh, we’re going to do resiliency 
training” or whatever.  
 
 
Currently, what has happened – and we’re at the highest rates of suicide for physicians 
right now. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
Physician Oral History: Dr. Sean Runnels 
Page 25 
 
SR: 
The highest rates of chronic clinical depression and the highest rates of people leaving the 
profession early. Right now. And what’s happened is we’ve allowed administration to 
become too revenue-focused. Or value, you know – value is kind of a tough word, 
because it’s difficult to define. But if you think of a medical system – the only value 
that’s created in the medical system is between the providers and the patients. That’s 
where the therapeutic relationship’s happening. Without providers and patients, there is 
no system. And so those are the two key value creation components.  
 
[49:17] 
 
 
Now, administrators and administration can optimize that value, or optimize those 
revenue streams, and they can enlarge the revenue streams; but they can’t create the value 
and they can’t create the revenue stream. And physicians and providers have lost the 
power, and because we’re a money-focused system, and essentially, we’ve allowed 
medicine to become a business. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
SR: 
And so by becoming a business, we’re like any other financialized business in that we 
have over-focused on enhancing the revenue stream. And now, you know, with EMRs 
that are primarily billing tools, with administrative growth over 3,000% in the last 30 
years –  
 
LG: 
Holy moly! 
 
SR: 
Where provider growth/physician growth has been 150%. And it’s actually gotten to the 
point where the administrative burden and the EMR burden is now decreasing the amount 
of provider-patient value creation (you know, that therapeutic relationship), to the point 
where we’re actually killing, you know, killing the golden goose.  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
SR: 
And you know, physicians are leaving because ultimately everybody (not everybody), but 
people went into medicine and the rewarding part for us is actually the human part. You 
know, you get financially rewarded as well, but there’s a cost – you know, you’re 
spending your life energy to get the dollars, and part of what refills your tank is looking 
at somebody, knowing you helped them, you know. Having them say, “Hey thanks, you 
really put me at ease before you went to sleep.” And you know, “Thank you, thank you.” 
That’s part of what refills our tank.  
 
 
And at this point, the administrative burdens have gotten to the point where it’s actually 
fundamentally interfering with the doctor-patient (or the provider-patient) relationship. If 
you’re taking a history, and you’re turned and typing on a EMR the whole time, and not 
looking at the patient, then the patient feels that distance.

LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
SR: 
And I think, you know, it can’t be overstated that we’ve been turned into data entry 
machines by the administration. And that’s actually gotten to the point now, where it’s – 
ultimately, we’re spending three times as much as most other countries on healthcare, and 
our patients over the last three years have been living shorter lives (on average) in the 
States. That’s a big deal. 
 
LG: 
I didn’t know that, yeah. 
 
SR: 
That is a big deal, right? And so, we’ve hit that point where, where something’s got to 
give. And yeah – something; and I don’t know what that will look like, but it will happen. 
 
LG: 
Yeah. Yeah, it’s interesting that you bring up the resiliency thing, because (as we were 
talking before the interview); from my impression, the literature on resiliency puts an 
additional burden on the physician. So, it’s so individual –  
 
SR: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
The work, right? 
 
SR: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
I have to do all this work, I have to –  
 
SR: 
When do you have time? 
 
LG: 
I have all this time, I have all these pressures. And then the resiliency is almost like. and 
in addition to all of this stuff –  
 
SR: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
It’s another responsibility. When it could be done differently, you know, like as a support 
system. 
 
SR: 
Yep.  
 
LG: 
And I don’t know what it would look like, I have no idea. 
 
SR: 
Yeah, and there’s just no time to do that.  
 
LG: 
Right, yeah. [Inaudible] 
 
SR: 
It’s like you know, they say, “Well, you know, we’re going to have these yoga sessions.” 
 
Physician Oral History: Dr. Sean Runnels 
Page 27 
 
LG: 
Right. 
 
SR: 
“Okay, well when are they?” 
 
 
“Oh, they’re between 1:00 and 2:00 at the library.” 
 
“All right, well; that’s great.” You know? Or, “We’re going to do these evening 
resiliency sessions.” 
 
Well you know, I’m already working 60 hours a week, so the last thing I want to go do is 
go to a resiliency set – I want to go to my kid’s swimming meet. 
 
LG: 
Right. 
 
SR: 
You know? There’s no time. And I think that’s the thing that’s changed, is we always 
spent a lot of time in the operating room, and we spent a lot of time with our patients, and 
we spent a lot of time in the hospital with our colleagues; but now our time is on screens. 
And you know, it’s a microcosm, but maybe even in sharper relief with physicians – but 
it’s a microcosm of what’s happening all over America, is everybody is spending more 
time on screens, less time looking at people, talking. 
 
 
I mean, how many times do you get a chance to sit down and actually have a 
conversation like this with people? You do all the time, because you got this great grant –  
 
[Chuckling] 
 
 
But you know, we don’t. And I think that’s what’s really –  
 
[54:18] 
 
 
You know, I worked in Africa for three years, and that’s what you had was time – you 
had great amounts of time. It was a relationship. You know, people were in the hospital a 
lot, but you were talking to patients; there was no EMR; and you know, information got 
transferred just as well. So. 
 
LG: 
Do you feel that that – I did know that statistic about the suicides –  
 
SR: 
Um-hmm? 
 
LG: 
Do you feel that contributes – that’s a contributing factor? 
 
SR: 
Oh, absolutely. 
 
LG: 
To the suicide rates? 
 
Physician Oral History: Dr. Sean Runnels 
Page 28 
 
SR: 
Yeah. Yeah, I suspect that there’s a correlation between clicks, and screen time, and 
suicide; absolutely. The EMR has been a disaster, and I don’t think it’s a fixable disaster, 
because the primary function of the EMR is to bill. 
 
LG: 
Bill. 
 
SR: 
And the information transfer and cataloging, and all of that is a secondary after-concern, 
right? And so, it does a whole bunch of things that are anti-therapeutic: number one, it 
makes physicians into liars, in that we have to click a whole bunch of buttons saying we 
did a whole bunch of stuff that we couldn’t possibly have done in the ten minutes you 
have to do an H and P on a patient. You can’t do a 16-point physical exam in that time, 
but it won’t let us go to the next screen until we click all the buttons. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
SR: 
And so, and every day you realize, you know, I’m actually – I mean, fraud is an ugly 
word, but it’s embedded systemic overstatement of what you’re doing. And that is built 
into that system. And so, every day it reminds you that it’s more important to click 
buttons and bill for the patient, and get the revenue, than it is to actually touch the patient, 
look in their eyes and talk to them.  
 
 
So, that’s – and I think that (again) gets to that, what’s your primary purpose of going 
into medicine? Most people went in there to get that win-win situation; so, it reminds you 
that you work in a business, and that the doctor-patient relationship is subservient, or that 
therapeutic relationship is subservient to the business. So, it does that. 
 
 
It breaks patients down beyond organ systems into billing systems. And so, you know, 
we flip through screens, and it’s all based on billing, and so it really changes the way we 
think about our patients, it’s very disruptive. 
 
 
So in medical school we take our patients and we break them down into a model called 
the organ system model. And then this model is not in our heads, it’s a billing system 
model. And so, I really – this, straight out of the back of my head, I have no evidence for 
this – but you know, what I feel like is it kind of puts you in that double-bind in that 
you’ve got two models going on: one you don’t even realize is happening, which is 
breaking your patients down into a billing system –  
 
[57:12] 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. That’s an interesting [??] 
 
SR: 
And it’s in conflict with what we are taught from day one in medical school.  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
SR: 
And so, I think that that leads to some really deep dissonance in physicians.  
Physician Oral History: Dr. Sean Runnels 
Page 29 
 
 
 
And then it just is, every time we end up with something that’s more efficient, then 
administration just shoves more work in it. And so, it’s not like, you know, if AI comes 
(which it will) and it takes some of the decision-making process out, administration is not 
going to fill that time and just say, “Hey, why don’t you spend 40 minutes with the 
patient instead of 20?” You know? Because AI is going to – they’re just going to say –  
 
LG: 
More productive –  
 
SR: 
Yeah, because it’s a financialized system (or a monetized system). And so, I think that 
that’s something that’s going to be addressed somehow, whether – you know, I don’t 
know what that looks like. But that’s got to be addressed, because it can’t go on. 
 
 
We’ve monetized as much of the system as possible, to the point where we’re (again) 
three times as much of the GDP is going into healthcare, but we’re getting –  
 
LG: 
Less results. 
 
SR: 
We’re actually getting negative results now. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
SR: 
You know, patients are declining in age, which is, you know – that’s a problem. The only 
places I know that that goes on is Afghanistan, Syria and the United States, where we 
actually have decreasing –  
 
LG: 
Longevity? 
 
SR: 
Longevity. Every place else, even the Central African Republic is increasing longevity 
right now.  
 
LG: 
Wow. 
 
SR: 
So, yeah: wow [laughs].  
 
 
So, I think we’ve hit that point where things that can’t go on, can’t go on. And I think 
that, you know, we can’t just put in more into the system, more money into the system 
when it’s producing negative results, is insanity. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
SR: 
It just can’t happen. And I think Americans are sensing that; they don’t want to go see the 
doctor – you know, I don’t want to go see the doctor because I don’t want to interact with 
the billing system. 
 
[59:15] 
Physician Oral History: Dr. Sean Runnels 
Page 30 
 
 
LG: 
Yeah. 
 
SR: 
So, I think that that – I don’t know how that will sort itself out; but I think that’s going to 
sort itself out. 
 
LG: 
Would you say that that’s the biggest challenge facing physicians, or that you face in 
your work? 
 
SR: 
I think that that is the biggest challenge facing physicians at the moment, is burnout 
stress, administrative burden, EMR; absolutely.  
 
LG: 
Okay. 
 
SR: 
I think that’s it. 
 
LG: 
Would you characterize that burnout stress as suffering? 
 
SR: 
Sure, yeah. 
 
LG: 
You would? 
 
SR: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
You’d say that’s a fair –  
 
SR: 
Yep. 
 
LG: 
Assessment? 
 
 
How do you think being a physician has changed you as a person? 
 
SR: 
I think the biggest thing that (well not the biggest, but one of the things that) I didn’t 
expect is you know, as a physician you get to see the width, breadth, and depth of the 
human experience. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
SR: 
You know, everybody comes to see you; you get to see all walks of life. I think judges 
get to see it, police officers, priests, and probably physicians. 
 
 
And so, you know, a much broader perspective about like what’s going on out there –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
Physician Oral History: Dr. Sean Runnels 
Page 31 
 
SR: 
Because you just can’t believe it if you’re an upper-middle-class or a middle-class 
person, and then it’s like, “They did what?” [Laughs] You know? Who thought that was a 
good idea? So, you get that. 
 
 
You know, we don’t see a lot of people die. I think that’s one of the other things that I’m 
surprised – I thought I’d be dealing more with like the full extent of human life – but that 
goes out to hospice now, and so we don’t see the end of life all that much as physicians. I 
see docs do a little bit –  
 
LG: 
That’s interesting, yeah. 
 
SR: 
But it’s not like you’re there at the deathbed, you know? 
 
 
I think it does make you resilient, like you know, if it doesn’t kill you in med school, 
there’s very little that – you know, like I’ve got a business and I start, and you know, I 
work a ton with the business, and I’m used to dealing with uncertainty and all of that. So, 
it makes you pretty flexible. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
[1:01:24] 
 
SR: 
And it gives you all sorts of options that you may or may not deserve. So, if you have an 
MD behind your name, there’s doors that open, whether you have that expertise and 
experience and they should open to you. So, it’s an incredibly flexible job, as far as -  you 
know, I can pursue work in any country I want, almost.  
 
 
It’s a very secure job in that people need doctors: human sickness and suffering is not 
going anywhere anytime soon. And so, you know, being that healer; a healer in any 
culture is important. And you’ll always kind of get away with (not get away with), but 
there’s always kind of a prestige to that, and a place in every society for you.  
 
 
Yeah, I think those are the things that really pop to mind.  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. And what advice would you give to somebody who is thinking about medical 
school today? 
 
SR: 
Yeah, I would say look beyond the (kind of) the EMR and all of those problems; they’ll 
work themselves out. It’s a fantastic profession. I would recommend it to anybody. You 
can do anything you want in it. It was one of the reasons I went into it, was, you know, at 
one point after I’d decided to go to medical school, I was toying with doing a molecular 
biology PhD instead –  
 
LG: 
[Laughs] 
 
Physician Oral History: Dr. Sean Runnels 
Page 32 
 
SR: 
And I realized that, you know, if I do a molecular biology, it will be super interesting, but 
it’s that really super narrow scope. And I could go to medical school and if I’m interested 
in physics, go into radiology. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
[1:03:12] 
 
SR: 
You know, I’m interested in engineering, and so I’ve got a medical device company. I 
worked for Africa for three years, and so I’m super interested in culture and anthropology 
– and I can do that. And I can, you know, I can investigate that if I want.  
 
 
And so, it really spans all other walks of life, and it allows you – you know, you’re not 
limited. You’re not limited. You can always do more, and you can always do things that 
you are interested in. So, if you’re an OB/GYN and you’re interested in anthropology – 
you can do the anthropology of, you know, childbirth. 
 
 
Yeah, and so it doesn’t limit you. And other – so, you don’t get pigeon-holed. And I think 
that’s the best part about it. Also, you get to – you have a special license to get very 
intimate with people (not in a physical sense), but in an emotional sense: in that you’re 
seeing people when they’re at their most vulnerable. And you can step in and really, you 
know, connect with those people in a very human way and really, really put them at ease.  
 
 
And I think that’s something that you don’t get in a lot of other jobs.  
 
LG: 
Yeah. 
 
SR: 
You know? And it’s a real privilege when, you know, you see somebody with cancer and 
you know that [snaps] – poof, disappear [speaking to dog] lay down. 
 
 
You’re meeting with somebody with cancer, you know they’re in palliative care now. 
And you can look at them and really connect with them as a human being and say, “I’m 
sorry,” you know, “this is a really hard experience.”  
 
 
And they might say something like, “Actually, it’s been the best thing that’s ever 
happened to me, because look – my family’s all here.” 
 
 
And so can, you know, how many times can you sit down and get that kind of, you know, 
real raw, emotional, you know, naked response from somebody? Where you really get to 
see how, “Wow, that wasn’t what I was expecting at all.” 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
SR: 
And so, you get to ask about people’s grandkids. And you know, when I’m in the 
operating room I do a lot of spinals for elderly people getting hip surgery, and so I don’t 
usually sedate them, I just sit and chat with them. And how often do you get to spend a 
Physician Oral History: Dr. Sean Runnels 
Page 33 
 
couple hours talking to somebody who is a World War II veteran? Or you know, people 
are really interesting and we just don’t have time to talk to them.  
 
 
But that’s unique in anesthesia, and you know, most physicians now don’t really have 
time to talk to their patients anymore. In fact, you know, just a couple weeks ago I was 
talking to a bunch of medical students and they were trying to decide what they wanted to 
do. And they all thought they wanted to do anesthesia, and I asked them why? And 
they’re like, “Oh, because you guys actually get to talk to your patients.” 
 
 
And I thought, “How crazy is that?” 
 
LG: 
Yeah. 
 
[1:06:21] 
 
SR: 
That when I was going into anesthesia, the stereotype was people went into it because 
they didn’t want to talk to patients.  
 
LG: 
Right, because you presume that the patient is out. [Laughs] 
 
SR: 
But now, students are going into it because they actually see that we’re not completely 
overwhelmed with charting. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
SR: 
You know, most of our charting in the operating room is happening automatically. But 
you know, I can still do the H and P pretty quickly, and then chart it in the operating 
room, not there. And so, I can just have eye-contact with my patient, put in the IV, chat 
with them for ten minutes, put them at ease and have that, you know, therapeutic 
relationship with them. And then get them off to the OR, ask them about their grandkids, 
and get them off to sleep, or put a spinal in and chat with them.  
 
 
And I thought, “Oh, my god – that is such a terrible sign that if you want to talk to your 
patients, you should go into anesthesia.” [Laughs] A bad sign of the times. 
 
LG: 
Well it shows how much the technology is also shaping students’ decisions. 
 
SR: 
Yeah, absolutely. 
 
LG: 
You know, about what they’re going to do. 
 
SR: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
You know? I mean, it’s interesting.  
 
SR: 
Yeah. 
Physician Oral History: Dr. Sean Runnels 
Page 34 
 
 
LG: 
A lot of people have mentioned the Electronic Medical Records, but nobody’s really 
talked about how it might be even shaping those kinds of decisions. 
 
SR: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
You know? 
 
SR: 
Yeah, you know – I mean, it’s like any other screen: if you stare into the screen for eight 
hours a day, there’s going to be culture coming through it –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
SR: 
It’s going to form the way the inside of your brain works. 
 
LG: 
Yep. 
 
SR: 
And you know, we shouldn’t be surprised that screens – you know, it’s like everybody’s 
shocked when you give a cell phone to your teenage daughter and suddenly she’s 
depressed, and all of that. It’s like, you know, come on; you know, if she’s staring at it 
eight hours a day, it’s pumping culture, it’s pumping, you know, how she embodies the 
world, or how she thinks she embodies being a young female, and all of that stuff.  
 
[1:08:23] 
 
LG: 
It infuses teaching too. 
 
SR: 
Yeah, yeah. 
 
LG: 
I mean, half the university courses are online. 
 
SR: 
Oh, yeah; no, it’s –  
 
LG: 
a whole different--all around. 
 
SR: 
It’s a different deal. And I think the proper way to look at it is, you know, from the same 
way we look at all interventions is there is benefits and there’s harm. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
SR: 
And I think we have like, you know, we’ve completely ignored the harm. And there are 
benefits to the EMR, for sure. But on the whole, I think the current embodiment of the 
EMR, in that its first principle is to bill (it’s a billing tool), that that has caused more 
harm to the profession and to the doctor-patient relationship and to medicine itself. 
Because it’s just furthered that transformation into medicine as a business. You know? It 
just reminds you every day the most important thing is that I bill. 
Physician Oral History: Dr. Sean Runnels 
Page 35 
 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
SR: 
And I think that’s, on the whole, the long-term aggregate harm from that outweighs the 
benefits. I don’t know of a better way to say it. And I think we’re going to find the same 
– you know, we already see, you know, like the massive online universities and things 
just aren’t working. You know, you’ve got to have a guide, you’ve got to have a sensei, 
somebody that can help you understand what’s important and contextualize.  
 
 
And you know, you’ve got to have humans in the system. Because it isn’t just 
information transfer. If it’s just information transfer, then you just, you know, can plug 
something into somebody’s head. And you know, you’re a computer – and we’re not 
computers, we’re humans.  
 
LG: 
Yeah. 
 
SR: 
And so, there’s got to be that guide that contextualizes stuff, and can explain things on a 
very individual, contextual level; or it just isn’t –  
 
LG: 
Well medicine is, you know, really an apprenticeship. 
 
SR: 
Um-hmm, yep. 
 
LG: 
I mean, it’s experientially –  
 
SR: 
Oh, yeah. 
 
LG: 
Based.  
 
SR: 
Yeah, if you think about, you know, I did a fellowship in Cambridge, England – and the 
only reason I bring that up is Cambridge is where, you know, some of the first 
universities, you know, came into existence. And I don’t know if this is true or not (I 
think it is, because it was told to me by a Cambridge professor, so they’re generally pretty 
reliable), but you know, initially those universities – and this is true, initially those 
universities were monasteries. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
SR: 
Right? And so, you had the apprentice monk – or, the novice, the apprentice – I can’t 
remember. But eventually when you became a full-fledged monk you were tenured, and 
you could stay in the monastery forever: have food, water, and shelter, and live your life 
out in the monastery and die there. And that’s, you know, largely the whole professorial 
system.  
 
[1:11:25] 
 
Physician Oral History: Dr. Sean Runnels 
Page 36 
 
 
And then the monks that took care of the flesh were robed in black – or I’m sorry, they 
were robed in white. The monks that took care of the interpersonal relationship (the legal 
guys) were robed in red. And the monks that took care of the spiritual stuff were in black. 
And those were largely the three kind of stems to medicine –  
 
LG: 
Medicine, law –  
 
SR: 
Legal system, and –  
 
LG: 
Priests. 
 
SR: 
The priests.  
 
 
And so, you know, we come from an off-shoot of the priesthood. And I think all of those 
legacy, you know, deep underpinnings are all still there in medicine, and in the legal 
system too: we still gather ourselves in robes, (even if it’s bad for our patients) we still 
wear our white coats. And patients expect that –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
SR: 
That’s what they’re looking for. You know, it never works very well when nuns dress in 
modern gear and then go try to minister to South Americans; they want to see a nun –  
 
LG: 
In traditional –  
 
SR: 
Same with in Africa, they want to see nuns in traditional dress. Because that’s part of the, 
you know, spiritual relationship. And same thing with the therapeutic relationship in 
physicians.  
 
 
You know, when I was in Africa, I had this crazy experience where I was talking. I was 
in South Africa, and I’d been in Africa for about two and a half years. And we were 
trying to decide whether to stay longer or (you know, another year or two), or come 
home. And I was in South Africa on vacation, and we were at a braai (a barbecue). And 
there was a guy there who was Afrikaans, he was like six-foot-six, white as you and I, 
just you know, six generations deep of Dutch Afrikaans.  
 
 
And he said, “Oh, what are you doing in Africa, you know? You’re an American.” I said, 
“I’m working in Rwanda, for the National University of Rwanda, you know, training 
residents and helping them get their training systems kind of set up.” 
 
 
And he said, “Oh,” you know, “there’s probably all sorts of things about your residents 
you can’t figure out.” I was like, “Yeah, by the way, there is.” 
 
[Laughter] 
 
[1:13:44] 
Physician Oral History: Dr. Sean Runnels 
Page 37 
 
 
 
And he said, “Well I’m a traditionally-trained African healer.” And I was like, “Really?” 
And he was like, “Oh, yeah.” And so we talked for hours. 
 
 
And it turns out there’s a whole training system in South Africa; or you know, they don’t 
limit themselves to South – but there’s a spiritual training system there. And there’s 
levels of training, a body of knowledge you master. It’s all informal –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
SR: 
Nothing written down; but you take tests, and you move up the ladder.  
 
 
And he said, you know, “Do you find your residents jump to a single diagnosis  and you 
can’t – they close their differential, and they don’t talk to the patients a lot? They don’t 
take histories?” 
 
 
And I’m like, “Yeah; that’s actually been driving me nuts.” He’s like, “Well that’s very 
simple, because in Africa, a healer is somebody that works in the spiritual world. Because 
the Africans are sick (central Africans) and people who are living in a traditional, non-
molecular world don’t get sick because of molecules and organ systems. They get sick 
because there’s an ancestor that’s upset with them.” But it’s all happening in the spirit 
world. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm.  
 
SR: 
And so, that’s what causes the sickness. And so, an African archetype of a healer (a 
traditional healer) works in the spirit world, where the patient can’t see. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
SR: 
And so, if you’re asking the patient, “What’s wrong with you? And, tell me what you 
think is going on?” You’re a weak healer, right? They didn’t come to you to have you ask 
a history. And so, you’re projecting yourself as a weak healer. And then the perception of 
the patient is, “Why are you asking me?” 
 
LG: 
Why bother? 
 
SR: 
And I heard that all the time from patients, “Why are you asking me?” You know, 
“You’re the doctor, why are you asking me?”  
 
 
And I didn’t even get that before then. And then I’m like –  
 
 
So, when you travel into the spirit world – so, you know, he just walks up and he can see 
what’s going on. And then the negotiation is, “What do you need to leave this person 
alone?” Or, “What do they need to do to alleviate,” you know, whatever they did. Or is it

a family member that did something, and the group is sick, and they’re manifesting in 
this patient, whatever.  
 
[1:15:55] 
 
 
And so, I was like, “So, is traveling in this space – is that a gift or a talent?” 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm; that’s a good question. 
 
SR: 
You know, and he’s like, “Oh, it’s a total skill. You learn to do it. You know, at first 
you’re a novice, and there’s a soap you lick, and that, you know, makes the barrier 
porous. And you only go in with a master. And he introduces you to the spirit world,” 
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And he was like, “You know, I can take you there tomorrow.” 
 
 
And I was just like, ah, you know – one part of me was like, great because I was like two 
and a half years into Africa, and there was all sorts of things going on with my patients 
that you can’t quite explain. And you know, the longer you’re there, the more you realize 
that the allopathic system has some huge gaps that, you know – depression (we kind of 
were talking about this before). But places without molecular mechanisms –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
SR: 
Because in the States we’re physician scientists, that’s what a healer is, and that’s what 
patients are (somewhat) expecting, although I think there’s some, you know, now that 
religion is broken down, they expect – they don’t have a place to find spiritual, get their 
spiritual needs met anymore. And we don’t do that well.  
 
 
And so, you see there’s huge gaps in the allopathic system, with places where we just 
can’t explain why the patient’s not getting better, or sick, or whatever. And maybe that’s 
filled in by there’s a spiritual part. And maybe, you know, the ancestor that’s bugging 
you is when you wake up at night, feel guilty that you didn’t say goodbye to your mom 
before she died. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
SR: 
You know, you missed that because you did something else instead. 
 
LG: 
So, did you say yes? 
 
SR: 
No. So, I decided it was time to come home because I felt like that would be kind of 
going through the looking glass. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
SR: 
And I wasn’t quite sure I was ready to – I mean, it sounds crazy, but it was just like you 
know, it was the moment of like, “I think it’s time to go home.” 
Physician Oral History: Dr. Sean Runnels 
Page 39 
 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
SR: 
And get back to the States for a while. Because I just wasn’t ready to let go of my 
worldview. 
 
LG: 
Grounding? 
 
[1:17:57] 
 
SR: 
Yeah, my grounding.  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
SR: 
I guess that’s the right word. It was one of those moments of like, but I was tempted. And 
I’ve got the guy’s email. And now that I’m grounded again [laughs] –  
 
LG: 
It sounds like he was a really great –  
 
SR: 
No, he was a great guy. 
 
LG: 
Helper. 
 
SR: 
No, he was. It was one of those kind of pivotal moments where I really realized how little 
I knew about the culture that I was working in. And where it was a reinforcement of like, 
you know, if you’re not aware of anthropology, and you know, the kind of world that you 
work in, in that anthropology and you know, storytelling and stuff is really about the 
underlying collective worldview that we don’t even understand is there. You know, the 
things that we just take for granted.  
 
LG: 
For granted.  
 
SR: 
Like a healer works in the molecular world. Or you know, what the white coat means, 
and you know, what a therapeutic relationship is, all that kind of stuff; you know, why 
people get sick. Without understanding that, then it’s really difficult to do any cross-
cultural work.  
 
 
And now that, you know, America’s face is changing so much, and we have all sorts of 
patients that are coming to us from completely different worldviews, and they’re running 
into this American medical system that’s really set up for Northern European, Anglo-
Saxon –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
SR: 
You know? 
 
Physician Oral History: Dr. Sean Runnels 
Page 40 
 
LG: 
Well that’s what we believe, is it’s just a –  
 
SR: 
It’s really, really tricky. 
 
LG: 
It’s just kind of an assumption –  
 
SR: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
And you don’t know that they’re there, because they’re sort of the base. 
 
SR: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
You know? 
 
SR: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
And so, yeah – until you find something that contradicts it, it’s hard to know that they’re 
there. 
 
SR: 
Yeah. Yeah, it’s the classic, you know, (this is so overdone) but you know, the “fish out 
of water.” 
 
LG: 
Yeah. 
 
SR: 
Fish doesn’t know what water is until you take it out. And I think that’s the value, you 
know, I have a lot of residents that ask, you know, “What can you tell me about global 
health?” And you know, some people are like – there’s a lot of questioning about what’s 
valuable about global health. And I’m not sure that the going over and doing medicine is 
the valuable part.  
 
 
In the way we practice global health now, the valuable part is it wakes up the western 
physician to culture, and how important culture is in shaping and making a sustainable 
medical system. You know, most of the work that’s done overseas has very little impact 
on the systems (or even negative impact) on the medical systems.  
 
 
You might impact a patient or two, but it’s often at the cost of the medical system itself. 
And I would argue that a lot of what you think is impacting a patient is actually, if you 
were there longer to see what happens to that patient over time – there’s negligible 
impact in the way we practice global health now.  
 
[1:21:01] 
 
 
But I think people are starting to wake up to that and global health is changing. But the 
bigger thing is it makes you come back to the States and you realize we’ve got global 
health [laughing] going right here, you know?  
 
Physician Oral History: Dr. Sean Runnels

Most of my patients (not most, but a lot of my patients) don’t speak English now. And 
they’re from cultures all over the world. And you know, I know little things like when 
Africans – when I have Rwandan patients (and there’s a few Rwandans in town now), 
you know, I know they don’t want to hear risks and benefits. They just want you to say, 
“I’ll take good care of you.” 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
SR: 
You know? And when you tell them all the risks, you’re just terrifying them. I mean, 
that’s not relieving suffering, those are legal check-boxes. And so, maybe I’ll get in 
trouble for that someday, but my standard thing is: 
 
 
 
“Here is the magnitude. Everything we do has risks and benefits. And the benefit is you 
can get surgery. Everything we do, including riding in a car, has risks. I can go into all of 
those things with you if you want to hear them, or I’ll just tell you we’ll take real good 
care of you. This is what I do every day, and I’m really good at my job.” 
 
 
And 90% of the patients, Anglo-Saxon, everybody else, you know, 90% just say, “Thank 
you. Thank you.” And they don’t want to hear anything about risks. So you know, but I 
wouldn’t have been sensitive to that before I worked in Africa. 
 
LG: 
That’s so nice to hear that perspective. 
 
SR: 
Yeah. But I’m sure that I’d be hung out to dry if I get in a lawsuit –  
 
LG: 
Right. 
 
SR: 
But that’s okay. 
 
LG: 
[Laughs] 
 
SR: 
We’ll see. 
 
LG: 
That is also the American medical system, right? 
 
SR: 
Not sure I want [inaudible]. Yeah right, it’s the American liberal system, so yeah. 
 
LG: 
Well is there anything that we haven’t talked about, in terms of medicine, that you feel is 
important, that you would want kind of a general public perception of your job, you 
know, that you would want people to know? 
 
[1:23:00] 
 
SR: 
No I think, I mean, I think most people understand medicine is pretty grueling. And I 
don’t think like the medical profession itself, the physicians (and I’ll just speak for 
Physician Oral History: Dr. Sean Runnels 
Page 42 
 
physicians, not nurses, and everybody else), but you know, as far as physicians, I don’t 
think that there’s a lack of trust in physicians.  
 
 
I think that the lack of trust and the problems with the medical system are really centered 
around the administrative, you know, bureaucracy. And I think physicians are really 
starting to push back on that. I don’t know that it’s being seen, but you do see it in like 
the AMA endorsed – I think they endorsed a single-payer system. You know, they said, 
“Yeah, actually we should do that.” 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
SR: 
And for the AMA, which is traditionally out protecting our income streams, to do that – 
that’s a big deal. And so I think that the tide’s turned, and I think over the next five to ten 
years there’s either going to be a crisis, and the business part of it will just kind of 
disintegrate, but physicians will still care for patients. Or there will be push-back. 
Although, I don’t know if the system can actually be changed without disruption at this 
point. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
SR: 
That’s my guess, is it will be disrupted. I just don’t know how, or what that looks like.  
 
 
But no, I think that you know, the specialty is in crisis in that physicians are in crisis. But 
I don’t think that the doctor-patient relationship is in crisis, in that it’s no less therapeutic 
than it used to be. It’s just being muted and snuffed or smothered by –  
 
LG: 
Shaped? 
 
SR: 
By the administrative and bureaucratic overlay right now. And I don’t know how that’s 
going to [laughs] come out on tape, but I don’t know of a more elegant way to say it. 
 
LG: 
Yeah. 
 
SR: 
You know, I think healers are fine. And I think, you know, we’re super resilient. And you 
know, people say, well the millennials aren’t as resilient or they don’t want to work the 
hours – absolutely they’re just as dedicated as anybody else. I think that what they’re 
trying to do is set up a system where they don’t have to work the hours. Because I don’t 
know that working really long hours is good for our patients either. And so, I think that 
that kind of hubris is starting to break down.  
 
[1:25:28] 
 
 
But I think that the profession itself is okay, it just is really stressed at the moment. I 
mean, we’re not going to be replaced by machines. Nobody goes to a doctor –  
 
LG: 
For a machine to see.

SR: 
Hoping a robot is going to –  
 
LG: 
Yeah [chuckles]. 
 
SR: 
Operate on them; nobody – you know, it’s like self-driving cars: there’s a small 
contingent in California that would be happy to do that, but most people want to control 
their own destiny. And physicians as well. AI will be fantastic in that it will augment the 
doctor-patient relationship, but it isn’t going to replace it.  
 
LG: 
It will be interesting to see in 25 years – there’s a lot of people who have sort of felt like 
medicine was kind of at a transition – like to see what happens. And then see, with these 
interviews, what people were saying, what they were thinking about. 
 
SR: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
Kind of after that transition. 
 
SR: 
Yeah, I mean, it will change for sure. But I don’t think ultimately – I think it’s going to 
be down to the doctor-patient relationship, and that endures.  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
SR: 
And I think physicians will get back to that. We’ll, you know, throw off the yoke of 
administration, or whatever – I don’t know. 
 
LG: 
Just a suggestion. [Laughs] 
 
SR: 
I don’t mean to sound crazy. 
 
LG: 
No, not at all. 
 
SR: 
But the system is going to change; but ultimately physicians aren’t going anywhere, and 
patients are still going to come to us because a lot of the reason patients get better is the 
placebo effect.  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
SR: 
And that is, essentially, the therapeutic relationship. And you know, if I went and saw a 
traditional healer in Africa and they put on a costume and went into a trance, and I had a 
cold, I probably wouldn’t – there’d be very little placebo effect because it’s not culturally 
contextualized to what I think a healer should be.  
 
[1:27:30] 
 
Physician Oral History: Dr. Sean Runnels 
Page 44 
 
 
But if it was a physician and they gave me an antibiotic, then my cold lasts – you know, 
sometimes it just gets better because I think the molecules are going to – and if they 
inject it, it’s even better still. 
 
LG: 
It’s also the invisible world. 
 
SR: 
It is, yeah, yeah, yeah. And so, I think ultimately that’s still there. And I don’t think that 
is in crisis other than it’s under attack. But I don’t think it’s going to be replaced by 
machines or anything like that.  
 
 
 
What we do every day will look different; hopefully it looks more like what we did in the 
past, which was to actually have human contact with our patients. And it may be, you 
know, that some of that placebo effect will be by physician, you know, advanced 
practitioners and all of those – I don’t think it has to be a physician, themselves. Like I 
don’t think that, you know, the doctor archetype – it will take a while for that to break 
down.  
 
 
But I think – my kids are all wanting to go into medicine and I’m not encouraging it or 
discouraging it. But I think it’s great; I’d be happy if they did. I think it’s going to be fine. 
 
LG: 
That’s great. 
 
SR: 
And I think, you know, we’re going to have – the system will have a crisis, but I don’t 
think physicians are going to have a crisis. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
SR: 
And I think ultimately, it will be better than it is now. So I’m optimistic about it. 
 
LG: 
That’s nice. 
 
SR: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
Yeah. Okay, is there anything else you’d like to add? 
 
SR: 
I don’t think so. I’ve probably talked too much already. 
 
LG: 
No. 
 
SR: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
Okay. I’m going to do the closing tag. 
 
SR: 
Okay.
