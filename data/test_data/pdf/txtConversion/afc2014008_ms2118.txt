DENVER CHAC REMARKS
 1995
 
I had the honor of speaking at a similar occasion  just one
 
year ago.  And now I have been invited back.  It's always a
 
special  joy to be invited back;  everybody knows how good that
 
feels.  I really thank you.
 
But  since  I was here a year ago,  the road we all travel on
 
has gotten kind of bumpy,  hasn't  it? And lots of people are
 
standing on either side of it yelling at each other using the
 
most uncongenial  language.
 
Now,  when the temperature of public discourse goes up,  all
 
kinds of useful  ideas get  scorched and twisted and savaged in
 
the  flames of partisanship.  Take the simple idea of multi-
culturalism.  It's really nothing but a new word for a very
 
old American principle that holds we should welcome people
 
who come new to this  country and value the  special gifts they
 
always bring with them,  But  sometimes now we speak of it as
 
though it were  something brand new -
-
 and possibly dangerous.
 
We really need a little chililing out -
-
 as my grandchildren
 
put  it -
-
 to remember that there never has been a time when
 
only one kind of people lived in the vast continent that  I
 
flew across yesterday.  We' ve always been multi-cultural here
 
Even pre-history shows different groups of indigenous tribes
 
and settlements occupying North America,  especially here in
 
the west.  And Eppie Archuleta's  fore-parents were raising
 
their sheep and cultivating their land when the New England
 
colonists were putting in their first crops.
 
I think one reason people are presently so worried and
 
behaving in such un-American ways  in expressing those
 
worries,  is because we' re getting a little more crowded.  We
 
run  into each other a lot more often.  The Plymouth settlers,
 
after all,  probably never even heard of the Spanish
 
conquistadores or the Ute  Indians and vice-versa,
 
Besides,  for much of U.S.  history,  everybody thought that
 
cultural differences would just go away eventually,  because
 
everybody believed in the melting pot theory -
-
 the notion
 
that the whole United States is a kind of huge boiling vat
 
into which everybody who comes here tumbles,  to be melted
 
into a sort of standard-issue American.
 
The automobile magnate,  Henry Ford,  was once  supposed to have
 
put on a dramatic presentation of the melting pot theory at
 
his plant  in Dearborn,  Michigan where he sent a parade of
 
automobile workers of all shapes,  sizes,  and ethnicities out
 
on the stage dressed in their original national costumes.  And
 
they circled around into a kind of central tent in which they
 
tore off their varied finery and came back out,  all dressed
 
in red,  white,  and blue,  all the  same,  waving American flags.
 
But a major problem kept arising with the melting pot theory
 
-
-
 it  just didn't work.  And really it hasn't ever worked the
 
way it was  supposed to.  As a
 theory,  it was a bust.  Though
 
some folks melt -
-
 and that's  just fine if they want to -
-
others  simply do not and will not melt,  and they go on kind
 
of floating around together in lumps.  Indeed this  is when the
 
idea of the so-called hyphenated-Americans came in,  because
 
people began talking about Greek-Americans,  Japanese-
Americans,  Mexican-Americans
 and so on,  by which they were
 
trying to indicate that these particular folks hadn't melted
 
nor did they show much signs of doing so.
 
So today,  even if the U.S.  Congress went completely insane
 
and decreed that not one new immigrant  should ever step on
 
our shores,  we Americans will go on,  as we are now and always
 
have been,  living in a multi-cultural  society.  And that  isn't
 
so bad,  is  it?
 It's kind of nice.  We might try to think more
 
about those nice parts.
 
What have we to offer each other across the cultural  lines -
-
what have we to gain from each other? The beauties of
 
differences.  (
If everything is the same,  there is no beauty
 
as Henry Ford made clear.)  And the reassurance of
 
similarities.  (To feel comfortable,  one needs to see some
 
shared qualities.)
 
Oh,  I know it's  complicated,  trying to understand and get
 
along with different kinds of folks.  Back during World War II
 
my husband's brother was  in the merchant marine,  stranded in
 
a desolate Saudi Arabian port town waiting for his ship to
 
clear.  He got to be friends with a little Arab boy,  a bright
 
cheerful  little  fellow;  they taught each other games and
 
words  from their languages and sort of palled around.  One day
 
the  little boy said proudly that he could write an English
 
word -
-
 and given a piece of paper and a pencil,  he did -
-
four staggering capitals that  spelled SHIP.  But the way he
 
did it was the Arab way.  He wrote it right to left the way
 
Arabic is written -
-
 P I H 5-- spells  SHIP,  doesn't it,  when
 
you  just  look at  it?
 He got the result just  fine,  but he
 
used a different process to get there.  And that was all right
 
except that he couldn't use his experience to go any further,
 
to  spell PUSH,  for instance.
 
He  just didn't  really comprehend what he was doing.  But we
 
have to agree he was doing it.  He was giving the business of
 
learning about another culture a good Arab try.  And so should
 
we all.  You have to work to figure anything out across
 
cultural  lines.
 
But  sometimes  I think we ought to try some easier ways too.
 
For instance,  last evening I and some other lucky people sat
 
in an old Hispanic church listening to Brenda Romero's  lovely
 
soft voice and guitar as  she  sang us  songs that were already
 
old in medieval times.  And we sort of bathed in a glow of
 
Chicano-ness  in all its complexity.  Oh,  it helped if you
 
understood Spanish;  it helped if you knew something of
 
Chicano history.  But  it wasn't necessary.  You could still
 
feel the passion,  for we were visiting the arts -
-
 and the
 
arts are ways of communication that have been invented and
 
developed by each and every group of people to explain
 
themselves,  to show themselves off with -
-
 to make their own
 
public statement about how nifty it  is to be a Pueblo Indian
 
or a cowboy or a Cambodian or a fellow from Veracruz or a
 
lady from the San Luiz Valley.
 
The arts of the people explain and demonstrate the special
 
beauty that  is the signal of each special people.  The
 
traditional arts are the old-timers,  tried and tested through
 
the years,  and they do the  job of showing off the wonderful
 
things about each group perhaps the most clearly.  But all art
 
grows out of tradition,  and shows  it one way or another.
 
We' ll undoubtedly understand this better when we actually go
 
outside and begin to look at and listen to the Chile Harvest
 
Arts Festival itself,  for we' re getting a double treat today
 
-
-
 a visit with the arts and a festival.
 
You know.  there are  lots of wonderful things about  festivals,
 
but the principle one  is that they are built  for rejoicing;
 
they are designed to make people happy.  That's what t ey do -
 
-
 help people mark something as
special,  m a7Ki:_-_
-
And when that happens,  when there is an atmosphere of true
 
celebration,  all of us tend to bring out the best and most
 
generous  sides of ourselves.  And that makes us rejoice even
 
more,  to be  in such fine company with such fine people.
 
The thing that  really makes me happy about the CHAC Festival
 
is that during a time of tight,  frightened,  neighbor-against-
neighbor feelings,  you folks out here  in Denver figured out
 
how to make a creative response to the currently fashionable
 
negative atmosphere.  You took two things that everyone agrees
 
are nice,  and they want them and they like them,  and you put
 
them together!  An arts  festival and a botannical garden.  What
 
a great  idea!  What a powerful combination!  Nature and culture
 
joining together and working together,  the way they are
 
supposed to.  I surely do hope you' ve got all those gorgeous
 
peppers growing here again this year;  I found that part of
 
the garden absolutely thrilling last year,  along with the
 
santos and the paintings and the tropical plants and the
 
matachines
 
I don't know if you really realize how remarkable this event
 
is,  how enobling your vision,  how exemplary your conduct.
 
I'll bet you' ve had an awful lot of fights bringing it all
 
off.  Getting two very different groups of people working
 
together isn't easy.  It was the  strength of the idea that has
 
pulled you this  far,  I'll bet.  I really congratulate you all.
 
A writer named Gary Snyder used an image in a recent book
 
that made me think right away of the CHAC Chile Harvest
 
Festival.  He was talking about the values of virgin forests
 
and the knowledge and wisdom of the peoples who originally
 
lived there.  And he said that each place and each people has
 
its own humus to grow in,  a special nourishing soil that has
 
been in place for a long time.  For human beings,  their humus
 
is  composed of custom,  myth,  lore,  art.  As this mixture ages
 
and is consumed,  new cultural items are added in with the old
 
to keep enriching the  soil where the children grow.  Eppie
 
Archuleta,  Eva Nuanez and other traditional artists whose
 
names we will never know gave depth to the soil,  but  I
 
believe that the Chile Harvest Festival will itself become an
 
important part of the humus  in which the children of Denver
 
will thrive and mature.  Thank you for inviting me here to
 
help you celebrate.
