Re:
 CERTIFICATE OF AMENDMENT OF CERTIFICATE
 
OF INCORPORATION FOR THE ASSOCIATION FOR
 
CULTURAL EQUITY,  INC.
 
Enclosed please find the revised first page of
 
the Certificate of Incorporation Amendment.
 Please initial
 
and redate the second page where you previously signed on
 
December 20,  1983.
 This original copy should be returned to
 
me for submission to the Attorney General's Office.
 I have
 
enclosed an extra copy for your files.
 
We are also enclosing Annual Report forms for
 
1981 and 1982.
 You must complete them,  and pay the fees and
 
deliquency fees before the Amendment can be filed.
 Please bear
 
in mind that your charter must be filed with the IRS by
 
February 11,  1984 so that you have no time whatsoever to lose
 
in filing these reports and in paying the late fees,
 since you
 
will lose your tax exemption if the papers are not with the IRS
 
on time and you cannot deliver the papers to the IRS unless you
 
file these reports and pay these fees.
 
Best regards.

Re:
 CERTIFICATE OF AMENDMENT OF CERTIFICATE
 
OF INCORPORATION FOR THE ASSOCIATION FOR
 
CULTURAL EQUITY,  INC.
 
Enclosed please find the revised first page of
 
the Certificate of Incorporation Amendment.
 Please initial
 
and redate the second page where you previously signed on
 
December 20,  1983.
 This original copy should be returned to
 
me for submission to the Attorney General's Office.
 I have
 
enclosed an extra copy for your files.
 
We are also enclosing Annual Report forms for
 
1981 and 1982.
 You must complete them,  and pay the fees and
 
deliquency fees before the Amendment can be filed.
 Please bear
 
in mind that your charter must be filed with the IRS by
 
February 11,  1984 so that you have no time whatsoever to lose
 
in filing these reports and in paying the late fees,
 since you
 
will lose your tax exemption if the papers are not with the IRS
 
on time and you cannot deliver the papers to the IRS unless you
 
file these reports and pay these  fees.
