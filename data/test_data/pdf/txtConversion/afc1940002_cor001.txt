Dear Mr. Spivacke:
I am contemplating a trip to southern Colorado and northern New Mexico next summer for
the purpose of gathering the music to popular ballads, wedding and miscellaneous songs,
at least twenty of which occur in the various folk plays of the region. As I understand it,
the Music Division of the Library of Congress has a recording machine that it lends out
on condition that it be given recordings of the material collected. If this is so, I should
appreciate it very much if you would write letting me know whether I may borrow the
machine and the exact conditions under which I may borrow it.
Yours sincerely, Juan B. Rael

Dear Mr. Rael:
The Library of Congress does lend its recording machines on occasion for the purpose of
collecting folk-songs for its Archive. It also supplies the collectors with disks and necessary
Library of Congress
Correspondence http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1940002.cor001
materials for the making of these records. These records, however, then remain the
property of the Library and are incorporated into the Archive. We do everything we can,
however, to cooperate with the collectors by accepting any reasonable restrictions on them
so that collectors may be assured of first publication.
The region you contemplate exploring interests us very much. If you will please give us
more information about your proposed trip and tell us approximately when you will be
needing the machine, we shall give very serious consideration the matter.

Dear Mr. Spivacke:
In view of the fact that you were uncertain as to whether of not you could lend me a
recording machine for the summer and since I could not wait till the last moment for a
definite answer, I have secured the loan of a machine elsewhere, which means that it will
be unnecessary for you to lend me one of your recorders.

Dear Mr. Rael:
First of all, I want to tell you that I am delighted to hear that you have obtained a recording
machine for your work this summer. When I wrote you last, I could not tell whether we
should have any machines at our disposal but since then, we have received a grant from
the Carnegie Corporation which should eliminate such uncertainties in the future. I am
enclosing a copy of a press release which will explain this. Please do not hesitate to call
on us for any aid which you think we can render.
I am returning the manuscript. Thank you for permission to copy it.

Mr. Harold Spivacke, Washington, D. C.
Dear Mr. Spivacke:
I am glad to hear that you received a very substantial grant from the Carnegie Corporation
and that you will be well provided with recording machines in the future.
If you would like to give me your cooperation, I think that we could be of great mutual
assistance to each other. As I wrote to you a while back, I am going to have a machine
available next summer, but there are several drawbacks in the use of this machine.
First, it is not a portable machine; second, it will be available to me only one week at the
beginning of the summer, and after that I would be able to use it only during week-ends.
The machine belongs to one of the southern Colorado colleges and they would have to
use it during school days. If at all possible, I much rather have a portable machine that I
could carry with me on all my field trips, so as to secure material that otherwise it would be
difficult to record.
The material in the region where I am going to work is so abundant that I do not believe
I shall have any trouble in gathering three hundred melodies of more. If you care to
derive the full benefit of the work that I am going to do, I shall be very glad to let you have
duplicates of all the Old Spanish folk tunes that I may collect, provided I may secure the
loan of one of your machines.
In one of your letters, you seemed to express concern over the possibility that Mr. Campa
and I might duplicate each other's work. I shall try to eliminate that by not recording from
people who have contributed to him, and, if possible, by not working in the field of his
investigation. However, there is bound to be expected a certain amount of duplication in
Library of Congress
Correspondence http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1940002.cor001
the sense that in some cases we shall record the same melodies, but you must remember
that there are many variants of the same melody, and, as a result, our collections will
be all the more rich for those “duplications.” Of the “valse” I sent you, for example, I
expect to gather this summer one or more variants, perhaps even better than the one we
recorded last summer. I think that we would be making a sad mistake by failing to record
the different variants of the same melody for fear of duplicating the work done by someone
else. After all, the expense of recording, once you have the necessary equipment and
you are out on the field, is negligible. However, if you decide to give me the necessary
assistance, I shall be very glad to get recordings of just the material you want, in case you
do not want duplicate recordings of every thing I collect.
I plan to reach the field of my investigation on June 9th and expect to get to work at once.
I intend to spend a month in southern Colorado and then move to northern New Mexico,
where I plan to spend a month more.
Whether you decide to lend me a machine of not, I should feel very grateful to you if you
would recomend what you consider the most satisfactory disks for my purpose, and the
best way to get them. If possible, I should like to get the blank disks from a dealer near the
region where I am going to work rather than buy them out here on the coast. If you have
any other suggestions, I shall appreciate them also.
Hoping to hear from you at your earliest, convenience, I am,
Sincerely yours, Juan B. Rael. Juan B. Rael.

Dear Mr. Rael:
I have delayed answering your letter of May 7 because we are just beginning to organize
our new activities in the field of recording which were made possible by the Carnegie
grant. With the approval of the Librarian, I can now tell you we shall be glad to lend you a
recording machine this summer for a period of one to two months. We should expect you
in return to send us the records you make so that we may duplicate them for our collection.
Actually we do not have a machine in the Library at the moment and shall have to
purchase one for you. Since our chief engineer who has just been appointed takes office
on June 3, I hesitate to make this purchase without having the benefit of his advice. For
the same reason, I hesitate to recommend any special make of disc. Once he is here,
however, it should not take us long to get organized. In the meantime, you can organize
your trip so that your recording work will be facilitated when you actually begin.

Dear Mr. Spivacke:
I am very glad to hear it will be possible for you to lend me a recording machine. However,
for several reasons, I should prefer that you provide the discs, as you gave me to
understand you might do in your letter of December 2nd. In the first place, I am mainly
interested in the music related to certain folk songs and folk dances connected with two
or three pieces of research I cam carrying on. The number of melodies that I shall be
recording for myself will probably not exceed one hundred, at the most. On the other hand,
there are from two to three times that number that I do not need in my collection but which
you would want in yours. Again, I should like to be well equipped with discs (not less than
one hundred, and still better two hundred). If I buy them, I would have no use for any blank
discs that I might have left, but if you furnish them, I could return them without any loss to
you, since you would be able to use them later on. I shall pay for any discs that I use for
making duplicates for myself.
I want to assure you that I appreciate very deeply what you are doing for me and I shall do
my best to follow your wishes in recording the melodies you want.
Hoping to hear from you soon, I remain,
Very Cordial ly yours Juan B Rael

Dear Mr. Rael,
1. Give your trip a name, vis, “John Doe's Expedition to Kalamazoo”, or something of the
sort.
2. Number the records in the order they are recorded, writing or stamping the title of your
trip and the number of your particular recording on the top of each record envelope.
3. Scratch or write in the center of each side the letter A  or B , thus identifying the record
side.
A1— Barbara Allen, sung by John Doe with guitar and with fiddle by?is Henry, Pasedena,
N. Y. Dec. 1844.
A2— etc.
A3— etc.
A4— etc.
B1, B2, B3, etc.
5. Naturally, we hope that you will be able to furnish us with a great deal of additional
material surrounding the recordings, both, in terms of careful field notes and interesting
interview
6. It is very important to record the tunings of all instruments which play a part in the
music, to photograph the instruments and get the informant to explain how he plays it.
In the case of unusual instruments, it would be worthwhile to make accurate drawings or
send the instruments where they could be drawn to scale. If part singing is recorded, it
Library of Congress
Correspondence http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1940002.cor001
would be a real contribution to record the parts in the harmony separately. This can be
done by shifting the singers in front of the microphone.
7. As you know, valuable material is to be had from comparison of different versions of the
same song from different regions. So also, are different performances of the same songs
in the same community by different singers, or the same song by different members of
the family or the same song by the same performers at different times. Therefore, it is not
so important to us that material be always rehearsed without a mistake or hesitation. The
great beauty of field recordings is that performers take their own time and do things their
own way, feeling that if they make a mistake, they can try again. The results are such that
any commercial recording company can ever hope to achieve.
With best wishes for a successful trip, I am,

The delay which we did not expect was due to circumstances arising from the fact that

Dear Dr. Spivacke:
The recording equipment arrived here about Wednesday of last week, but due to the fact
that I was in New Mexico I did not get it until yesterday.
The directions for unpacking the material and for operating the machine have been
followed closely, but we have been unable to do any recording because the “cutting
needle runs in a single groove through coating of the disc”, and this is not because of
forgetting “to push the lever (B4) back before lowering the cutting needle onto the disc”,
as suggested under the heading COMMON FAULTS IN OPERATION AND HOW TO
CORRECT THEM. Dean Kittle of the Adams State Teachers College, who has had
experience in recording, and I have read the instructions over and over and have made
several attempts at making a recording, but have failed each time. As far as playing back
records is concerned, the recorder operates satisfactorily. Please advise me what to do as
soon as possible, as I plan to leave the field of my investigation on about August 13th.
Let me know, also, if the machine may be used on a 115 A.C. I notice in the
mimeographed set of instructions that when there is no 110 A.C. the use of the batteries is
recommended. I believe all the currents in this region are 115 A. C.
Library of Congress
Correspondence http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1940002.cor001
Not wishing to run the risk of failing to get your recorder, Dean Kittle and I made
recordings of about ninety different melodies using a recording machine belonging to his
institution. The records made are quite satisfactory, and I shall be very glad to lend them
to you in order that you may make recordings from them for your files. As far as making
more new recordings, however, I feel that I am going to be greatly handicapped. My funds
reserved for that purpose are all used up. When I first came here I had planned to spend
a month in southern Colorado and a month in northern New Mexico collecting material.
However, due to the fact that the machine did not arrive when expected, I had to abandon
that plan completely and found it necessary to make periodic trips to Antonito, Colorado,
my headquarters, hoping to find the machine there each time. Not only this, but I have
had to modify my plans all along, making it necessary for me to cancel engagements with
contributors very often. It meant that each time I changed my plans I had to get in touch
with five or six persons, and that, in turn, meant loss of time and money. In view of the fact
that my financial resources are quite depleted, it looks as though I may have to Abandon
this region leaving behind much material that in a year from now may not be available. I
have in mind, in particular, the melodies to the songs in one of the old religious folk plays
which has ceased to be presented. As far as I have been able to find out, the only person
who seems to know these melodies is an old man from New Mexico. Incidentally, I shall
have to cancel my engagement with him for tomorrow as well as other engagements in
New Mexico.
I do not know whether your Division ever helps to defray the expenses of people gathering
material on field trips. If it does and it could
I want you to feel, Dr. Spivacke, that I am deeply indebted for what you have done
for me personally. I realize that the delays in sending the machine to me were due to
circumstances over which you had no control. And, even though your division may not be
able to give me any financial assistance to enable me to carry my work to completion and
Library of Congress
Correspondence http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1940002.cor001
regardless of whether I use your machine or not, I hope to be able to show my sincere
appreciation by sending you at least one hundred and fifty melodies.
In fairness to the American Philosophical Society of Philadelphia, who made my research
trip possible, I should like to have you give them credit on your records for making the
recordings of the melodies I may send you possible. The American Philosophical Society
was very generous to me, but I do not feel that I should call on them for more financial
assistance. Furthermore, it would be too late to get any help from them.
Enclosed I am sending a receipt signed by me.

with them.

I am sorry that you had any difficulty with the machine and should appreciate a detailed
report of the adjustments you found necessary. This information will enable us to avoid
such difficulties in the future. I appreciate your sympathetic understanding and know that
you will realize that yours was the first loan made under the new grant and we really had
insufficient time for field tests which might have eliminated such accidents.
Mr. Wiesner informs me that the machine can be run on currents varying between 100 and
125 volts, 60 cycle A.C. You probably have found this out by now.
We appreciate your kindness in allowing us to copy the recordings which you have already
made. Will you please send them to us by express  collect  immediately, before you play
them at all so that our copies may be made while the records are in perfect condition. We
shall of course put the name of the American Philosophical Society on our labels.
In spite of the fact that we cannot aid you financially at present, I hope that you will still be
able to use our machine for future recordings. Hereafter, as you know, we shall be able
to plan our trips away in advance and we therefore look forward to many opportunities for
cooperation in the future.

immediately the  white  bill of lading to Mr. Lomax and the yellow bill of lading to us. The
Express Company will retain the pink one. We should appreciate also your sending Mr.
Lomax the set of instructions for operating the machine which we sent you.
With regard to the discs and needles, please send them back here whether used or
unused. For this purpose, we are enclosing franked labels which will enable you to send
them by parcel post in packages whose weight does not exceed 25 pounds. If these franks
are insufficient for the shipping, please let us know and I shall send you an additional
supply.
Finally, will you please give us any comments that you might have concerning the
operation of the machine. As you know, we did not have sufficient time to subject it to field
tests, and should like to know, therefore, what must be done to improve it and if possible to
make it foolproof.

In attempting to answer requests for copies of our recordings, I often wish to know what
your wishes were about the use of the recordings you made for the Library of Congress.
These records of course, are especially useful in that we are exchanging material with
Latin America, and I would greatly appreciate a word from you about your desires in this
matter. Naturally, we want to make the material freely available to anyone who wants it,
but if you plan to publish your work within some resonable time we would be glad to abide
by the conditions you impose.
Sincerely yours,

Dear Mr. Lomax:
I have no objection to your exchanging any of the material I collected with Latin America,
but I should appreciate if very much if you would make it clear that I am preparing for
publication the song melodies I gathered. At present, Dean Kittle of the Adams State
Teachers College and I are working on the  alabados  and their melodies. We also plan
Library of Congress
Correspondence http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1940002.cor001
to prepare for publication the melodies of the songs in the different New Mexican-Spanish
folk-plays. It will probably take us five years to complete all this work. Incidentally I do not
have all the  alabado  melodies and I may have to make another trip to Colorado and New
Mexico to complete my collection. When the time comes, I shall be very glad to let you
know.
As to Gallegos, I know him fairly well. He is primarily interested in New Mexican folk music
for the money he might get out of it. He has a number of New Mexican melodies in written
form, but I do not believe he has anything that we do not have.
Very sincerely yours, Juan B. Rael. Juan B. Rael.

I gather that Rael wants a five year publication restriction. Please ask him to make a
formal request which we can then try to clear through Mr. .

Dear Dr. Rael:
Thanks for your kind letter about your records. I find it necessary for reasons of Library
policy to request you to set some definite (in terms of years) limit on publication restrictions
in relation to your recordings. This is necessary due to the fact that our collection has
grown so large and that material in such a Library must either be available to the public or
must have some definite mark of its availability in the future.

It is possible that you might be interested in working on, or using as comparative material,
the records of Spanish folk plays in Texas which we have in our collection. Among these
I can mention two versions of  Los   Pastores  , one of  The   Good   Thief  , and another
which concerns the immaculate Virgin. These records are unrestricted and available for
your use if you care to have them duplicated. You will be glad to know there has been a
great deal of interest in your work on the part of the now active music division of the Pan
American Union.
Do you have any suggestions to make upon the subject of a bibliography on Latin
American Christmas customs which might have escaped me?
The engineer of the Sound Laboratory has just reminded me that
yours,
Alan Lomax Assistant in Charge Archive of American Folk-song
P.S. A request has just come in from Mr. M.A. Wilder, curator of the Taylor Museum in
Colorado Springs, who wants a few records of various sorts, for demonstration only, in the
Museum. I had thought of duplicating a couple of your Colorado records for this purpose,
but wish your express permission.

I should like to have a maximum period of five years as limit on publication restrictions on
all the materials I collected, if that is satisfactory to you.
Thanks for your offer to make recordings for me of Spanish folk plays in Texas. Later on I
may need such recordings.
In connection with your question regarding a bibliography on Latin American Christmas
customs, I cannot think of anything that might have escaped your attention. However, I
shall keep this in mind so in case anything comes up that you should know.
You have my permission to make re-recordings of any of the material I sent you for
persons who need such material for demonstration purposes.
Very sincerely yours, Juan B. Rael. Juan B. Rael.
