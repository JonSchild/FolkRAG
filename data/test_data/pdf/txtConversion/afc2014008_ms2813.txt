Dear J00,

I
've never answered your n
ice l
ong l
etter  t
he one you wrote r
ight
 
after the family reunion and no doubt have forgotten about by now
 
not because I d
idn't want to but because I couldn't think just ho;
i
o
 
answer it.
 I still don't know just what to say, but New Years Day
 
upon me and I feel the need to c
lear the decks andxtakezzarexaf AcrX
 
aniex
mixymm and my conscience of those many many things I haven't
 
done.
 
The best -
-
 i
ndeed
,
 
 the only -
-
 advice I c
an g
ive you about s
 i
ng i
nn  i
s
 
to go ahead and sing, s
ing often and happily both in public and i
n rrivate.
 
I personally like to sing in the car; i
t resonates n
icely and nobody
 
can hear you except for your passengers of course.  The advantage cf
 
solitary singing is that you can sing the same sor over and over until
 
you either get it the way you a want it or get tired of it, whichever
 
comes first.
 I do think you'd enjoy singing more if you memorized the
 
songs; it frees you up to think about intonation, holding notes, attacks
 
and releases, all those things that go into s
tyle.
 
That's really what I had in mind, rather than l
imiting your r
epertoire:
 
I simply meant to suggest that you should concentrate on a few songs to
 
begin with and then increase your repertoire andxX as you got more and
 
more songs by heart.  You'll probably find, as I do, that songs begin to
 
come back to me when I
'm singing (
especially a
lone in the c
ar!) that I
 
don't remember ever cpnsciously l
earning -
-
 I had just picked them up
 
as I went along and there they were s
tored in my brain for when I needed
 
them.
 
Conviction comes with p
i'a cti c
c
' and t
he f
ec i
 i
ig you
've explored the s
ong
 
upside down and backwards, that's all.
 1 also l
ike to try to imitate
 
traditional singers rather than the people who learned from them (
that
 
includes my brothers as well!).
 I don't always imitate, b y the way, but
 
I enjoy trying once in a while for an exercise, and because the subtleties
 
become more apparent when you try to do exactly what another s
inger has
 
done.
 I remember Woody singing one phrase of the Southern Casey Jones
 
record about a
. million t
imes, trying to get the exact intonation: "on that
 
same trackl on that same track" over and over again until you wantcd to
 
break the recordi and gag him or something.
 
People forget, I believe, or e
lse never realize the incredible x n amounts
 
of practice singers and instrumentalists tnyex always have to put  i
n.
 I
t takes
 
a long time.  M
me Talent has i
nfinitely less to do with it than does interest
 
and desire.
 I x used to tell s
tudents that when I first met Pete Seeger he
 
was such a weak and pitiful singer that Alan and Nick Ray, who were using him
 
on a radio program, used to try to get up their nerve to f
ire him after every
 
show.  They never could quite bring thmmselves to do i
t because be was such a
 
sweet kid at the time, but musically speaking he just didn't have it.
 But
 
Pete never stopped making music.  I
t nearly drove you crazy to have him around,
 
he was so continuously making noise, singing, humming, whistling, playing
 
instruments, drumming on the table; he never stopped practicing. I personally
 
feel you have to he somewhat obsessed to he a first-class musician; but there
 
i
s plenty of fun to go around for the rest of us who have o
ther things we want
 
to do too.
 
So there you are,  my dear

Dear  1

Uncle  1ie put me onto the
 
Volume, captives of Abbix Valley from which 1 copied
 
the genealogy .

, that is in you for
 
U. generations do
wn tLru your own progeny.
 I enclose
 
a copy brought down f
or ea L in individual style.
 
think it very interesting that  the earliest ancestry
 
of this line was one lord i1an of Buolcenhall;
 then, to
 
,,at back t
o that a.me name by devious route.
 Uncle
 
Allie swears t
hat alan was named after his but father
 
ya 'twarnt so*
 4t least uncle
 11ie feels it an
 
honor to him t
o have a nephew named after him by ;
,is
 
sister, and we shouldn't di8illu3ion him.
 The de Uil-
ed story of the Indian massacre  was çite i
nteresting

non-conformity way back in the 17th Century * 
iow, me,

he very welcone letter came just before 1
 
left Lubbock,  and it surely cheered me to hear all the fabulous
 
family plans.
 I will get a le ter off to Corey very soon,  and to
 
aomi and Joi r
n,  I couldn't be more pleased and excited.  hargaret
 
and I have been talking about possibilities of coming to the wed-
ding, and of course I will have to lay plans to get away, s o o n
 a s
 
a date is set.  hargaret has gotten as far as to hlaa wuat Sue Ujil
 
w

 evenl
 
Susan has been staying with the  ouaxes for
 
a few days and she and I
, along with her two dashcunds ihantis and
 
i
i
-naree and m
y
 lovely indigo, will be here until the baby comes.
 
.
h i e
 date set was day before yesterday, but when Susan saw her doctor
 
±uesday he did not expect it to be so soon.  She is of course very
 
ready to domino, and pretty uncomfortable, but that's one thing in-
aossible to predict.
 W
e
 are all rallying around trying to plan  some-
thing for every day that would be fun,  so the time won't drag so
 
muche
 vhen she gets out of the hospital we will move to
 Kemah,

 Clear Lake, you can see the water from

 street have a motor boat and a small sailing boat, and wish to
 
s
:iare.
 
l
' m really ready for the quiet life, the dorm
 
w
a s  unusually active the -last couple of weeks, had two attempts at
 
:
oanty raids during exam week,  and we were up on guard until a f t e r
 
tour both nights.
 Dorothy let me leave four days before the dorm
 
closed,  and that meant there was a lot I had to do early that I had
 
been able to finish up after the girls left km f
trx in other years.
 
-
'
-en to finish me off, it was announced on Thursday (I left Sunday)
 
that best would not be agirls dorm next year,  and I had to start in
 
madly packing all the things that night have to be moved out before
 
1 get back.
 In the melee I managed to leave several things that 1
 
had plauned to take with me do a here.
 
,
i
i:
m pre ty sure I wrote you what I was planning
 
to do with my home, turn it into a duplex and reserve the back part
 
f o r  m y  use.
 It worked out fine, and I
' m glad and think its a good
 
mover, but it makes the house work double, and I haul back and forth
 
5nd forth and back, and never know where anything is,  I an just sure
 
its at the other end of the line when I want or need it.
 I got so
 
far behind v
L
 th the things I wanted to d
o in the yard, and the last
 
day I spent most of the dar.light hours trying to get them done.
 
fter
 
three years of neglect by the sorority  the weeds are unbelievable.
 
1 did manage to dig seven kinds of iris to bring down here to share
 
with margaret and with Susan a boss, another devoted gardener.
 But
 
1 ended up pretty w.11 tjred out, and am having a hard time regaining
 
m y  get up and go.
 
The plans are for Chris and Lisa to come for
 
at least a month, and that will be so great for us all.
 The lady
 
has the sailboat will teach them to sail, and says if they are not the
 
silly smarty kind of children she will tie a life belt on each and
 
let them at it.  hian has announced his arrival for the acoucbnient,
 
ac haven' t figure out how we will have him here at the right tine,
 
you know he has this thing about having to know exactly when and
 
d
1ere,  so he won't be away from his office too long.  The new
 
jet airport here
t
hich is long behind schedule is to open on the
 
0th, and its about thirty-five miles from here, and we hear the
 
access roads are not complete, in the process tho.
 John has direly
 
grumbled that he does not intend to meet anyone there, they can just
 
come in on the bus.  And Alan always arrives in the middle of the
 
night, usually w
ith one hour's warning, so it should  be interettin0 
to see how it works out.  By the way, I sent your letter on to Fat
 
V
.i
th instructions to send to Alan,  so he should get the good worn
 
if you haven 't written him.
 
So I know pretty well what a mess you are in, seems as
 
iO  I have not been really settled for a long time.
 did get my
 
house fixed up mighty nice, of course still have some things I want
 
to do, but
 •
 Fext fall I will go to another dorm, and the apart-
ment has two bedrooms,  I shall enjoy the room.
 It also has a large
 
east balcony,  second f orr,  and my plants should really flourish.
 
ext year should be the last,  age-wise, and really will be ready to
 
it.  The attitude of the students is so changed, mine changes too,
 
only not quite so fast, nor so far.  We  are opening an open door
 
aorn
i in the fall, too, for seniors and those 21 years of age.
 It
 
night be interesting to go there, it would be really different,
 but
 
I l
t  it to my buss to decide,  she knows the d
. tuation, and really
 
nothing defin te has been decided about what the s
ituation for the
 
counselor there will be.
 I told her that I would ice to take it if

 u ng without the four a day he takes.
 This has a really Lad
 
effect on nis disposition, so we all step lightly, and high,  t
ie will
 
do the do next week, then gradually get back on his pills.
 I have an
 
idea what he is going through, for the trip I made down on the first
 
of hay the airline lost my bag on the homeward trip.
 I had not been
 
without thyroid for twenty-five years,  and since the man assured me
 
the bag would arrive any minute I didn't think of reordering my pills
 
and by the ona of the third day  .
 thout tnyroid I was practically un-
able to do more than creep from the bed to the couch.
 I didn't realize
 
what the trouble was, thought I must be coming down with a i±t sleeping
 
sicknessi
 I wonder what would have been the next reaction.
 Of course
 
the bag has not been found,  so I al in a wrangle with Continental over
 
payment.
 
Marga et seems to  have regained her umph,  I
'm so ha yy to
 
have her seem like her old self.  The situation
 th Johnny is much
 
better, in many ways,  and Joe is here now, always a joy to have arouna.
 
no is des1e rat y in love with a gal in Virginia, and trying to figure
 
out how to get there,  and stay.  He is thinking now he will transfer
 
to the U. of indiana, where Lynn goes, next year.
 
I do hope that you will find a nice place, and plai to stay.

 By the way, you did not mention

 Love to a
l 1
,
 
Dear Alan:
 
I am sending along an unsolicited copy of my latest paper which I read
 
at the California Folklore Society meetings last week.
 I hope you like
 
it*
 I worked very hard on it indeed, and I suspect I still have a bit
 
to go, but I cannot decide in whether it needs to be cut or extended.
 
(I am not concerned over the length but the coherency and clarity of
 
the argument.)
 I think it has some really fresh ideas in it; they
 
are very female, as all my ideas seem to be, but perhaps that is my
 
back-handed contribution to the womens liberation movement.
 
I am also enclosing a letter from Shirley.
 She sounds unhappy and a
 
little distrait;  I hope she does come to see us this summer --  I think
 
she needs to be taken care of herself for a while and I shall have
 
a little time to do it, fof a change,  Ithink.
 
ButCh and I have decided to go back to Santa Monica this summer, and 1
 
will be teaching at Valley State again 1
1itz next fall.
 Essentially,
 
we are out of money --  that which we had decided '
to spend on this year -
-
and since no now offers have turned up that were esppcially attractive
 
it doesn't seem worth it to hang on here (which we could do via part-
time teaching and so on).
 My set up at Valley State could be much
 
worse than it is;  I have a nice little hole-in-the-wall corner where I
 
can do pretty much what I want to without being hassled, and in many
 
ways, what more could you ask?- especially these days?  Dundes has
 
offered to arrange to get me into the Anthropology Department for further
 
study next year if I want to, but it would take at least three more years
 
to get a PhD and I am not at all sure I could hold up for the distance.
 
This has been pretty strenuous so far; by the end of the year I will
 
have completed forty-two graduate units, a language exam and a thesis
 
which is almost unheard of in
 o
re academic year, but
 
I am too impatient to slow down and have too much else that I want to
 
do before 1 gCt too creaky.
 
A letter 1xxxxx9ni
abs --  quite long but very funny --  ksx
xtk xfax *yx
 
from Corey is a on the family rounds to you.
 She and Mike have decided
 
to adopt a baby and are all cleared and accepted; apparently waiting
 
i
s an intrinsic part of the process of acquiring children by whatever
 
means.
 Maybe it's just as well.
 Anway, we will have our first "grand"
 
inside another month,  I suspect; she and Mike intend to come to California
 
for a visit during August complete with baby and dog, so we should have
 
high times.  Nick has proceded against almost insuperable obstacles to
 
get himself into Cal where he is taking chemistry, botany, calculus
 
and two courses in folk-dancing.
 I suspect a young lady must be at the
 
bottom of at least part of this; he still works week-ends at the humane
 
society and we occasionally see each other across the campus.
 He is in
 
great spiritsa, has lost much weight and seems to be on top of his world.
 
Naomi has reached that point in her education where she should go on out
 
and do something about it; she knows this and is rather drudging along
 
simply serving out her necessary time.
 It makes me very angry --  not at
 
her but at the lack of imagination and flexibility of the system.
 She
 
is clearly recognized by everybody as the brightest and most creative
 
student in the whole department but she still has some units and some
 
exams to hurdle.
 Such a waste of time for everybody.
 She keeps a sense
 
of humor and proportion,  though.
 She is taking a course with Thelma  .
'
 
(L British-trained animal behaviorist (Tinbergen school) who has all her
 
graduate students in an enormous lab full of cages of varied animal life
 
from beetles to hamsters which they are supposed to observe until theyi
 
notice something significant,  I gather.
 I asked Naomi what she had doen
 
yesterday and she said that she had watched a cage of finches all after-
noon, the main problem being that they hadn't done anything witt±x
 
at all except that finally one of them dropped dead -
-
 which struck
 
Naomi as the ultimate of not-doing-anything, so she went home.
 So it
 
goes in higher education.
 
as I crossed the campus
 
I got tear-gassed today/on my way to file a request for advancement
 
to candidacy for the degree of masterR of In arts.
 I wonder if there
 
i
s anything significant in that?  Dr. Washburn emerged out of the boiling
 
smoke and he and I retreated to the Anthropology building where I sat
 
the rest of the afternoon and listened to Alan Dundes summarizing a
 
historical-geographic

 And at
 
the end of the day we all go home each wrapped in our separate uonxx
 
cocoon of air like so many space travellers  ãd trying not to bump
 
into each other tgp hard.
 It is a dream-world, this campus; and so
 
far as I can tell, the isolation of each individual -
-
 faculty, students,
 
administrators, police -
-
 is almost complete.
 
I hope all is going amazingly well with you, honey, and that the choreo-
metrics data is behaving itself properly.
 God knows, we need somebody
 
to find out something about something; these Berkeley children -
-
 and
 
I include here the faculty -
-
 haven' t
 
got so much as a clue, most of them.
 Sad but true,  I
'm afraid.
 Much
 
love always to you, honey, and write when you have time.

Dearest Shirley and Tom,
 
I
'm returning a few things you sent me (
with directions to return)
 
and adding a couple of things on my own.  The Peanuts cartoon i
s just in case
 
you didn't see it.  The newspaper xolumn about the fox I thought was a really
 
nice piece of writing -
-
 it kind of meanders along but then socks it to you.
 
Besides, i
t contains a sentence I just might embroider on a plaque
 
"As in many cases of failed heroism, they were ready in their
 
brave hearts, but were unsure what you do, exactly..
 
This might, it seems to me, be a motto for our times, or any other times,
 
as far as that goes.  Do you think Juluis Caesar was all that certain what he
 
ought to do next?  Or George Washington?
 
I
'm also enclosing a copy of the Heritage Fellowshipx awards for
 
this year.  We almost got it right this time.  We gave out the certificates
 
in the Senate Caucus Room against the red celvet draperies and the marble columns
 
and our voices echoed back through history with the Presidents and Vice Presidnets
 
and Senators who have brought this room to l
ife.  And then we had the gala concert
 
in the Ford Theatre, and the honorees stood right there where John Wilkes Booth
 
had jumped down from the balcony screaming "Sic semper tyrannis!"... And there
 
was Mr. Bua Xoa Mua standing (
all 75 pounds of him) l
ike a rock, so brave, so
 
incredibly brave, playing music he knew no one could understand to an audience
 
he didn't think would listen and facing a future no would could possibly foretell...
 
And then there was Mr. Horace "Spoon : williams, in his rented tuxedo
 
with his starched ruffled shirt, so neat, so clean, so xkz1
ox sharp, except when
 
he spoke and you heard the s
lur that a recent stroke had put into his speech.
 
He lived, Shirley, in a rat-infested apartment building that was so bad the city
 
of Philadelphia had stationed a cop , full-time, to keep the peace in the lobby.
 
When you wanted to talk to Spoons, the cop would answer the phone and holler up
 
the stairwell... Spoons was absolutely the best spoons and bones player I ever
 
heard, and he was a fine street poet too.... Well, he got the award and he
 
went back to Philadelphia and hx he bought a second hand car so that he didn't
 
have to go to his gigs on the bus, and a tape recordeg and some bits of furniture,
 
and he put the rest of his big $5,000 in the bank, and the next day he had
 
another stroke and died right there on the street while he was washing his new car.
 
Well, anyhow, he had his moment, and maybe he felt that his government at least
 
cared in some way what his life and work had amounted to.
 
Well, I could go on and on.
 Somehow these heritage fellowships have
 
amounted to more than they were intended to at first.
 I do hope that one day
 
you can come up and see them.  i  I
'd be interested in what you think father and
 
some of the other o
ld-
-timers might have thought about them.  Axxmq They just a may
 
last.
 
I
'm g
lad you had fun with Pat and Kay.
 I think they are good people.
 
Loye always to you both,

 is a little joint within

short r ones you c n sle'o on our living room couch which is
 
bumpy, that's all, but compl t-ly at your disposal for as long
 
as you can put uD with it.  V would surely love to see you as
 
you full well know and Susan too, but I rememb r back to the
 
days of my youth wh n visiting relatives was not exactly what
 
I wanted to do all summ'r long.
 
In any case don't l t the matt r of accomodation
 
or transportation stand in your way. Xx The old J
p still pulls
 
just fine on th  hills and is always available so we can get
 
around xkm even if you don't drive out.
 
Ne are right busy making music or what passes
 
for same in loci

 a variety of other activities
 
which are too complicated for a short letter. The beach has been
 
wonderful so far and th  kids are turning into water babies.

our baby goat in the Pet Parade and I hay" to contrive some sort
 
of harness and trappings which sh" can't eat -

P.S. Any chance of Chris's g"tting away for a spell with you?
 
Dearest Father and Deanie:
 
Butch is out this evening at a photography meeting , so I r
nn seizing
 
a few minutes to catch up with r
ay correspondence. Deanie's letter
 
came this morning, telling of Father's illness. We are both quite
 
distressed. Hurry up and feel better, Father, honey; and Deanie,
 
do keep us informed of how things progress.
 
Life is settling down a little -
-
 we celebrated our second (week)
 
anniversary yesterday with a small bottle of wine; and pretty soon
 
we should be a sedate married couple. Our apartment steadily grows
 
prettier, and when I get up and draw the blinds in the morning
 
and the son comes in, I hate to leave it to go to my crowded office.
 
Next week we expect our sofa for which we've been waiting so long;
 
and our friends in Detroit report they have at long last shipped
 
my Mexican rug and the two Canadian blankets to us. 7.
1l
e have an
 
over-plus of lovely things. Butch told me just a lay or two ago
 
that he was almost afraid to enjoy them too much -
-
 they might all
 
sullenly disappear. Thanks to you two we are completely set up for
 
household linens; and Butch's parents sent us a check ear-marked
 
for some really good stainless steel silverware. We had wanted that
 
because it seems toomuch x of a long haul to start out collecting
 
real silver. Then two of Butch's friends gave us just last week
 
a set of pottery casseroles of all shapes and sizes -
-
 the kinds
 
that can be put right into the oven -
-
 and I
'm turning into a
 
casserole cook.  I stewed a chicken last weekX that I bet Father
 
would have just loved. I only wish I could send one to you by
 
mail -
-
 you'd probably get well just by smelling it.
 
Our days are settling into a little routine now. We get up togeth r
 
and while I fix breakfast in my bathrobe, But
,iresses and goes
 
own to get our mail. Then after breakfast I
4  while he clears
 
away.  V
e are due respectively at the office and at photography,
 
school at ten
 so we walk to the subway together and meet
 
back at the apartment m
LRkxx about seven. I shop for groceries on
 
the way home and cook supper while Butch studies. Then we clear
 
up and do odd jobs, go to a movie once or twice a week, visit
 
friends, stay home and read aloud or just putter around. Then
 
Sudays we clean house and rest up. I want very much to get a girl
 
to come in once a week to do heavy cleaning an
•
:l wash out my silk
 
things, but as yet we haven't been able to get one -
-
 help's hard
 
to fin]
, these days as you probably already know. My hours are so
 
long-- yesterday from ten till eight, today from ten till seven-
thirty -
-
 sit full days a week that it's a little hard to worry
 
about heavy household jobs at the same time.
 
butch is working quite hard too -
-
 eight full hours at the school
 
l
urin g the lay and extra study and occasional lab work at night.
 
He likes the school very much, and is pleased with the progress
 
he is making. At his request they are pushing him hard and setting
 
erofessional standards for him to fulfill, and ikA his teachers
 
seem to k have taken quite an interest in him. His general health
 
I think is improving, although he had a little touch of intestinal
 
flu last week whiuii e
-ept him in bed for two lays. R There has
 
been a mild epidemic th0xhK3kzXeRkxaXd of flu in New York, and I
 
cor ider myself quite lucky to have escaped.  Incidentally, the
 
German measles are going the rounds in mj office; I
'll probebly
 
fall ignominiously to that, although I
've had it once before.
 
My work remains difficult but interesting, and
. I find Nick a
 
very decent person to work for. His immediate superior, a Mr.
 
Houseman, is also a very able person; and we have been able
 
to progress steadily in the volume and importance of the work
 
our immediate office turns out. I feel very satisfied with the
 
whole set-up, si ply because of that last fact. The thing I
 
think I objected to in my last year's job was that we weren't,
 
as a whole unit, getting anywhere.  In this job, I know that as
 
my work gets more difficult and there are more demands on my
 
time, it is because I am servicing more departments and doing
 
a better job for them. And that makes it fun.
 
I want to get a little note off to m
'  sweet Shirley tonight, and
 
also one to Johnny and Margaret; so I guess I
'd better stop before
 
my literary well runs dry. I came to love Xarraret very m
iich duri g
 
kxxxi her stay here; you know,  I
'd never had much chance to get
 
to know her before and
. I found her so sweet and unfailingly con-
siderate. I think we're lucky to have her around.
 
Butch tells me daily that he's going to write you. I seem to
 
h:ve unwittingly added another bad correspondent to the family -
-
but I know that sooner or later he'll do it. He's a little em -
barrassed
., you know,.
 fore I stop, I just want you to know that
 
I am tremendously happy, very much in love and in a state of
 
general well-being that keeps me walking with my head well back
 
and my shoulders straight.
 
Your very loving daughter,

Nay 15, 1970
 
Dearest Shirley:
 
We have -
-
 like ten million
 others,  1 suppose -
-
 been trying to call
 
i ever since we heard
 of the di saster with no luck.
 I finally
 
called Umps night before last and got the news as far as he had it.
 
If there is anything of a practical or impractical nature that we
 
can do,  I am sure you will let us know somehow, so I won't burden
 
you with requests for news or with what-kind-can-I-do kind of questions.
 
Just holler, honey, and we'll come running.
 
In the meantime, for what good cheer it can bring you, we are j
ust
 
back from Canada where we met our first grandson: name, Jesse Paul
 
Denos, weighed in at 6 pounds 4 ounces, born April 20th, 1970.
 
He has blue eyes and slightly reddish hair as far as he has any and
 
is a placid charming baby who lies and coos to himself when he is
 
comfortable (which is most of the time when I was there as there
 
were four adults ready to hop to it when he gave the slightest murmur
 
of distress).
 He seemed to i
nc strong and well coordinated, could turn
 
his head well and was getting his hands in his mouth with a certain
 
degree of precision at about ten (
lays to two weeks (which was when
 
we saw him).
 
:)parently the fashion these days i
s to tell t
-he parents a g
,
 ood dear
 
about each other, although anonymity is still total y preserved.
 But
 
Corey and Mike have seen the entire family medical history and report
 
it oam almost completely blank,  the most dramatic medical problem
 
being a great aunt on the father's side who was allergic to cat hair.
 
The mother was eighteen and the father 21;  they had known each other
 
for six years and been going together for three years.
 It is unclear
 
whether or not the father knew about the pregnancy; he was in the north
 
of Canada and was flying back to Vancouver in a private plane which
 
crashed killing everybody aboard, and the mother decided to put the baby
 
up for adoption.
 It's all rather sad Fmxtyq really, but the baby
 
couldn't have a nicer home in my prejudiced opinion, nor may two more
 
doting and calm parents.
 Both Butch and I are terribly happy about
 
the way it all turned out.
 
Corey is coping extremely well, not even being too daunted I by an
 
imminent visit from Mike's mother, which would formerly have thrown
 
her into a tizzy.
 And, as I said before, Jesse couldn't possibly he
 
more cooperative; he sleeps well and eats well, doesn't have rashes
 
axxmyxknrkamx or spit up, and delivers himself at each feeding of a
 
seri es of fine masculine burps leaving in you in no doubt as to the
 
state of his digestion.
 Mike is thorou h1y pleased with himself,  his
 
son, and the world, and we left feeling that that little corner of
 
our family was in fine shape.
 
verybody else is in reasonable shape also.
 Nick is thoroughly enjoying
 
university life, in spite of all the hoorahs hereabouts which he main-
tains a certain sensible perspective towards.
 He is getting more and
 
more interested in medicine though I am not supposed to say too much
 
about it,  I gather, since he doesn't want to be held to it in future
 
conversations with all his relatives.
 Anyway, he is majoring in zoolo y
 
and is  acti ve  in  the pre-med st ude nts  club, has joined the sai l i ng
 
club which gives him frno r

the bay and the folk dancing club.
 This Latter group has been goin
,.
 
out to parks and shopping plazas and putting on little performances
 
in the open air while some of them circulate through the admiring
 
throngs passing out post cards on which people can write their congr s-
men about the Cambodian situation.
 This strikes me as a terribly
 
touching activity somehow in view of all the hoorah that is  oin  on
 
simultaneously.
 Most of these kids are realty so nice 
 
e1l,  honey, call us collect any time you can and/or want to especially
 
if you just want to talk to somebody.
 We love you very much a

I am well, finally started losing again but will probably regain the 2 or 3
 
more pounds I m have managed to shed this weekend as I have to attend a
 
large number of ceremonial-type meals.  Nzykaxixxxx  I am very bored with
 
this routine of down three and up four; I had just gotten back into the
 
routine following the Canadian trip in which I also managed to reverse the
 
trend.  Maybe I can keep it off this weekend by sheer nervous tension; it's
 
my first ceremonial appearance as Madame Prez, I am delivering a paper
 
which I expect to cause a pretty hot debate and, as Barbara keeps on pointing
 
out sadistically, I have to do the ceremonial introducing of "zxXha&Xxatx
 
all the dignitaries at the banquet and you know how easily I blank out on
 
names.  Do you think if I wiggle my foot enough?
  
Must run and pack.
 I love you very much and miss you greatly.
 What do
 
you hear from Houston?  I've determined to keep my telephone bill down
 
this month and have been denying myself the luxury of long distance calls.
 
Hope all goes well with your oncoming visitors.
 Will write again soon
 
and let you know how Nick is and how my meeting comes out.
 
All my love,
 
P.S.
 The enclosed poem about Butch Mike gave me when I was in Canada.
 
O n
 39 A
W
 
I wish you'd send it on the family rounas, lastly to Alan,
 
who is, I think, currently in Italy for a few weeks.
 I think the poem
 
is really beautiful; Mike is really a dear person.
 
May 2

Dearest Shirley, T
Jmps, Margaret et al:
 
I really have no time for a proper letter, as I must leave for school
 
(my next-to-last afternoon seminar for the semester, thank goodness)
 
and must take this typewriter, which has developed an occasional
 
grinding noise in his its interior, by for the repair man to look over.
 
However, since the
 x± a
mx semi-annual crisis period of paper and
 
exam reading is almost upon me, I thought I
'd best get off at least
 
a note before I sink totally under the sea of folders which is already
 
up to my waist.
 I have a four-day week-end coming up, thank goodness,
 
and maybe I can get it down to normal size if I don't do anything else.
 
Anyway, herewith is the latest from Nepal, with some exciting news
 
about their trip home, which sounds magnificent to me, though I
'm
 
sorry they won't get in in time to join us in Oregon as we had all
 
hoped.  We now, by the way, have a house in Oregon -
-
 three bedrooms,
 
five beds, a block from the beach; for some reason, the real estate
 
company hasn't sent along the address, so I can't include it but will
 
write it to you as soon as I hear.  Now all I have to do is locate a
 
place to stay in Portland the nights I will be staying over for teaching,
 
and everything will be-all set.
 
Corey and Mike write that all is reasonably well with the young '
uns.
 
Megan's digestive problems appear to have settled down.
 Jesse's
 
current favorite song is "What'll we do with the baby-O?"(which ends,
 
as you may recall,  "throw her out the window-O"), but that seems fair
 
enough, considering that they went through a period when she had to
 
be fed no more than 2 ounces
 
at no closer than 2 hour intervals!
 I should imagine
 
that was a drag for everybody concerned, and I
'm surprised that any
 
of the family is even speaking to each other.
 
Jesse appears to be talking well now and produced, Corey writes, a
 
paragraph the other day.  When she told him they were going to go pick
 
up Mike at school, he announced:
 t
W "Jesse no go get daddy.  Daddy
 
come home on bus.
 Jesse go see Ailsa."
 (Ailsa is his best friend -
-
an extremely determined young lady of 2 years of age who lives a good
 
car-ride away and who has her parents exactly where she wants them:
 
under total control.  We visited her during my trip up there, and it was
 
pretty clear to me that Jesse is the only person in her immediate circle
 
who has the potential to stand up to her; they absolutely adore each
 
other and the battle begins the moment they have rushed into each other's
 
arms.)
 
No further news really.
 The Sea Islanders have departed; they are mar-
vellous fun to be with, but I must say I was glad to get them loaded
 
onto that plane.
 It took me a solid 24 hours of work to get them de-
cided on how, when,axi with whom and in which combinations they would
 
travel, including two trips to the travel kxrtax agency, and we still
 
had to run to make the plane!  Must run.
 Barbara and I both send
 
much love.
 
Affectionately always

'll drive her down to the coast w
 
ce for ±
xx
k a week-end's relaxation, then back to Portland t
 
1y home Monday.
 It will be nice to see her, and I hope she  '
ed

"
Ie

n mind for all the assorted grown-ups they deal with.
 
egan is settling down gradually, devel ping a fine smile and no -
_
 
eeming as tense as when I first met her this trip.
 She is not
 
asy gurgly baby that Jesse was, and her insides are still givin
 
ccasional troubles, bouts of colici in the evening and such, Vui
.
 
keep telling Corey she'll eventually grow out of it, and I ha
 
een perceptible progress just since I
've come.
 She's going to
 
r
fully pretty, lovely eyes and long fingers and toes; her hair a
 
rown, although lightening up a trifle and very fair pale skin al-
ost bluish in spots -
-
 not the rosy kind that Jesse had.  Her eye,
 
oem to be settling somewhere between brown and hazel though it's
 
c
it early to tell.
 I
've had no special experience about how Indi
 
abies look when small, but I suspect she will turn out more Med -  
erranean in appearance than Indian.
 She's a wirey strong-musci
 
caby and I expect she'
 
j
ust what Corey needs.
 
orey and Mike seem f aIk ;;

it more real vacationing in when I get out there to stay.  As i
z
 
i
tt's a trifle like home, I suspect, though the beach is gorgeous,
 
"
,
insets lovely, lots of tide pools to poke in and occasional trips •
L
 
earby parks etc.  But there's always diapers and bottles and tired
 
children to cope with; but then that's the way it gm will go for i
i
 
for the next few years.  As I say I hope we can make it a bit more
 
-acation-y when I
'm around to help out a bit more often; we've had
 
couple of pounce games and a scrabble round or ira of an eveninc,
 
aostly sit around pretty exhausted and chat.
 
haybe you will send the enclosed letter on

Dearest Shirley,
 
I am on my way to the post office
 (
played hookey today to get
 
the loan started for the apartment; I had thought of going in to work
 
after that but it was just so nice to have a day to catch up on things).
 
Anyway, I found this little pile of junk that I x had clipped out
 
of the newspaper for you.  Nothing special.
 I just thought you would
 
be amused to see what Vera 1
kxx1xk  (
of the scarves etc.) looks like;
 
there's hope for the two of us yet!  And then on thiat same page there
 
was such a nice appreciative article about irises I thoughtyou would
 
enjoy it.
 I realize, of course, nzgefeRzEz±sx
E e x you know all that
 
but I must say I enjoy reading this gardening writer in the Post.
 
Finally there is an article about the AARP, quite out of date, I expect
 
by now.
 It basically seems to revolve around the insurance part of
 
the operation; even after knowing and admiring Lonnie a
ll these years,
 
I still feel awfully suspicious of insurance companies.
 
I suppose I should not bite the hand that feeds me, speaking of insurance.
 
What with one thing an another, I just might have to sell a l
ittle
 
stock in connection with this apartment buying business. I really hope
 
it turns out all right.
 It is not my favorite of any apartment I
'v
 
been in -
-
 actually the one I
'm in now is my pet except for two Fat H
 
Flaws -
-
 I think if I
'm going to stay here for a while I really shot,] '
 
have another room, and the damn winter wind which whistles down this
 
particular way until I feel like I
'm l
iving in a Bronte novel.
 I toic
 
you, didn't I
, that I came home from work one blustery evening last
 
winter to find a two inch drift of snow all along the carpet along th
 
patio doors?  I had to xk w shovel it up with a tablespoon!
 
Anyway, 
Arlene
 
Covey thinks it's an excellent buy; it has better storage (
except in
 
the kitchen) of any apartment I
've been in; and it has a southern
 
exposure which means morning sun by the angle of this building.
 I
'm
 
worrying now about carpeting (
I can't l
ive with what's there) and furniture.
 
Wish you were here to hold my hand.
 I
'm beginning, though, to feel good
 
about bringing my bits and pieces from Santa Monica; it's time I started
 
l
iving here instead of just feeling like I
'm in an Rp especially comfortable
 
motel.
 
And -
-
 what I started out to ask you two paragraphs ago, how can I find
 
out the going rate for Employers Casualty?  I searched the financial
 
section last Sunday to no avail, but I seem to remember you located where
 
it was l
isted.
 I
'm hoping to get by without selling stock, but I
've
 
decided if I
'm going to do this, I
'm going to fix it up until T f(-1 cnnc1
 
in it, and that may take a little doing, financially speaking.
 
Must run, lovey.
 Be sure to let me know when you'll be coming
 
a complicated summer to schedule, especially since I
'll be moving in
 
August 15, and have to fit in birthing one baby plus getting out to CaL
 
to sort through my s
tuff, not to mention working one or two days in ther
 
Lovingly always,

Dearest Shirley,
 
I talked to Alan last week; he is deep in his movie project and hardly
 
ever coming up for air.  As a result, I think he is going to want me
 
to postpone my trip to New York for another few weeks; this is fine with
 
me, as I seem to have an indefinite number of things to do here and am
 
not really hurting for extra activity.  He proposed that we consider
 
(
after my stint in New York which would take about a month or six weeks)
 
taking a vacation in Saint Bart's or wherever all together -
-
 you and me
 
and John and Joey and Alan and maybe Carol depending on her state of
 
work -
-
 and staying down there for a month, maybe.  The way I figure it,
 
that would come in late April or maybe even early May.  How would that
 
grab you?  Sounds l
ike fun to me, and we could toot off from there or not,
 
depending on our exchequers, state of energy, and so forth.
 
So that's one way things seem to be developing.  Another thing came up which
 
I
'm interested in, and you might be or not, I don't know.  There's going to
 
be an international folktale meeting in Heiskinki from June 16-21st; and
 
Finn-Air has set up a package tour for people attending the conference to
 
tour the S
±etzH Soviet Union after the meeting; total time involved
 
June 14 (
leaving New York) to July 5th (
arriving back in New York).  Cost
 
is $995.00 including all transportation, hotel in Helsinki (
no meals), visas,
 
hotel and f
rill meals in Russia where we would visit Leningrad, Kiev and
 
Moscow, with various special tours of folkloric interest planned.
 (
Want
 
to go to a People's Hall of Weddings and see a Russian wedding?)
 I hear
 
from the University of Texas that Roger Abrahams and his wife are goin ,
 
as well as Dick Bauman, so there should be a good bunch -
-
 probably sort
 
of like your Mexican tour -
-
 and I think it might be a lot of fun.
 In terms
 
of cost, it doesn't seem excessive to me in terms of what we'd get; I
'm
 
a bit appalled at my total outlay, wkexz Qgzx&g Qxz1hy& if the Caribbean
 
trip comes through too, but I decided at the beginning of this year that I
 
really have plenty to do what I want to do, and this was going to be my year
 
to howl, so I shou l
d make full use of it.
 
Anyway, if the i
dea jut crests you, 1
 et mc know r
ight
 ay, as I should send
 
n a reservation for two or one, as the case might b
c  (
it's $110 extra to
 
travel in solitary state); maybe give me a call, or drop i
nc a l
ine.  You
 
might find the meeting boring, I don't know; on the o
'her hood, toikiorists
 
don't always talk shop... Anyway, think about i
t.
 
I
'm otherwise in good shape -
-
 lost 16 pounds and am determined on another 10
 
before I have to go east.  The store wouldn't take those brown pants back, it
 
had been so long since I bought them by mistake, so I have to reduce enough
 
to fit them!  The children are all well; I
'm taking the bus down to San D
iego
 
this weekend to visit Nick and Nicky; Naomi has been sick -
-
 various throat
 
troubles ever since she hit New England, that home of resporatory ailments,
 
but otherwise she sounds fin z fine.  Corey, Mike and the grands sound well
 
and happy and send l
ove, as do I
, of course, always,

the more harrowing details of the last three days -

T
uring the past month, we have had flu in several different disguises,
 T
 
i
.
tting each of the family at least twice to the point of incapacitation.
 
:
orey was in bed with a fever for one of her toughest finals and had to
 
;ke it -up; Naomi deveipped such a bad chronic bronchitis that the docto

uspected t

:
lear up.
 Berkeley lost Corey's high school transcript so we still don'
 
i
ow if she's been accepted to college there or not and won't until the
 
:
iddle of July!
 I have graded and read four thousand final exams and te'
 
apers till my head was reeling, plus breaking in Frank Hamilton to take
 
y place at UCLA next fall, involving seven or eight interminable conf

'elped produce a movie of the Bessie Jones singers, and coped with the
 
'assport, he kth card, vaccination routine and the myriad shoppings, a

in  the last three weeks.  Alan phoned me day before yesterday announci
 
That the Georgia Sea Islanders had to be in Asheville one day before t
i
 
ad planned to; I spent at least five hours running around to bus comp,"
 
I
r
ld air lines to work out possible schedules, only to discover after a
t
 
east three hours persuasive discussion on the phone, that they wouldn'
 
o anyway no matter what.
 This latter crisis broke just before Corey'
 
raduation; Bessie Jones then arrived for a visit with :
1rs. Goose Tatu
 
'md her little boy the afternoon of the girls' bus departure and staye
 
F
or two hours!  Well, the upshot of all this is that I have been findi
 
things the girls forgot all over the house, including Mx =iJxxMx1Wt
 
ômi's cuitar in the case of which she hac ncker

 This we will have to air
 
o anyway, intellectually,
 
over-weight (it's odd -
-
 I always gain during crisis periods and lo '
 
nen things simmer down) but otherwise blooming.
 I have accepted the
 
:t Valley State for next fall, with a lightened schedule in mind, plus
 
ore money.  txñ
;tx
 I don't know yet how it will work out or wheth
 
will enjoy it; if I had known how much trouble it would be to re-arr
 
t
ii bix things so I could cut down my xxit UCLA schedule with some confide:c

I thought you and Jargaret might get a smile out of a bit from Naomi's
 
first letter from New York.
 The Scout troop, together with Corey,
 
are staying at a Scout House out in New Rochelle until the troops
 
takes off (or they did take off today, I suppose).
 Herewith Naomi,
 
on her first experience in New York....
 
"Corey and I set out.  As the i
t train started in New
 
Rochelle, we met a girl who said she would help us get on and off
 
at the right places.  We got off at Grand Central Station and she
 
got us a taxi. Halfway through the ride, Corey whispered to me and
 
asked if we were supposed to tip taxi cab drivers.
 I said that I
 
didn't know and to wait and if he wanted a tip he would ask for 0 it.
 
When we arrived, Corey paid him $1.50 for our fare.  He sat there
 
with his hand out and so I told him that we were from Los Angeles
 
and never rode in taxis and did he want a tip?  He said that New
 
York drivers' rates were less than in L.A. and so they got a tip.
 
So, Corey gave him 50 .
 I was afraid it wasn't enough, but later
 
Uncle Alan told us he gave l5c  tips!
 So he
 
told us to go into a building that he (the driver) thouc
'iitwas 121,
 
but turned out be be a law school.
 So, Corey and I went down the
 
street till we found a door saying 1w 121.
 The door didnt èpen and
 
on the outside there were nameplates with buzzers under them so
 
we pushed the one under Lomax.  We were waiting for someone to come
 
when all of a sudden a buzzer rang.  We xxwRi
x waited some more
 
and finally we tried to push the door together but it was locked.
 
We rang the buzzer again and in a few seconds the buzzer rang at us.
 
We finally, nkmal after about fifteen minutes, asked a man if he
 
could tell us how to get in and he laughed and explained how the
 
door should be pushed when the buzzer rings.  After climbing four
  
flights of stai*s, we reached Uncle Alan and Anne

J
:ps,
 
I have been clearing up a mighty a t  back-log of filin:
 
tois past couple of days -
-
 the usual end-of-the-semester
 
job, and I came across the enclosed letter marked "please return'.
 
It;s mighty old and apparently I -
lust have had it forever, buL
 
here it is back to you anyway.
 
I also re-read one of your letters concerning Deanie's
 
estate, and it brings up a question I have been meaning to as:
 
you.
 I understand that Deanie's special bequest to me (
thanks
 
to your and Shirley's generous thoughts) is in the form of a
 
cash bequest.
 In the first place, it occurs to me that I haveu':
 
the foggiest notion what to do with that much cash except stick
 
it in the savings account (unless, of course, something special
 
comes up *xkR in the house line or something of the sort).
2mxHty:
;-
khaxn
 
It would seem to me that there ought to be some form of
 
investment that would make better sense than the old xx savings
 
routine, however.
 Which brings up the second question.  Am I
 
correct in assuming that Re. Bank stock will have to be sold in
 
order to provide the cash for the bequest?  This seems kind of
 
too bad, in view of how nice and steady this stock has been. I
s
 
it legally necessary to fill the bequest in terms of cash, or
 
could it be in the form of stock, should this seem the most s
:  s
i - 
ble thing to do?  If you don't know the anwer to this one, I D
 
can write Mr. McBain; I just regard you as an authority on thc
 
will and finances in general by now.
 If it's a nuisance to you
 
to find this out for me, I
'll take over, but I would appreciat
 
our views on the matterc in general, anyway.
 
Corey is in New York visiting Alan for a week or so,
 
taen sets sail for Boston to spend a week with her grandmother.
 
aomi is winging via Icelandic Airways to Luxemburg.  Nick a
rid
 
leave Sunday for Idyliwild for two weeks, where Nick plans to
 
scuip and I plan to do all the jobs I haven't had time to get d
-
this winter because the dum phone rings every five minutes.
 bu c
 
says phooey to all this long-distance stuff; he will stay home
 
quietly and paint pictures.  We all love you and hope to see yoi
 
s
aybe later this summer.
 Does the Mexico trip bring you within
 
hailing distance of southern California?  Maybe we can dash dow.
 
to the border and extend hands across anyway.... I

skinny; I didn't actually count the rooms, but I don't believe ther.
 
were more than six double rooms on Corey's floor plus a large and
 
i

as a common room for anybody who wanted to use it.
 I would say ther
 
i
ould be a maximum of fourteen girls per floor, which would certaid
 
cut down on the noise factor; also each room has its own tele hoae
 
connected with the switchboard, eliminating ths

onday when I went to get the dogs from the vet, the vet said we had

 She died the next day;  I have just gotten up my nerve to wri::
 
orey.
 Actually,  I had almost expected it when we left her; about
 
cek before she had almost overnight turned into a really old dog -

re
e  was suddenly almost total'y deaf and she kind of creaked arou:

ne house -

 and she had a real bad cough.
 The vet said at that t

r heart was going and gave her some digitalis which perked her u
 
;  little, but I kind of knew she was at the end of her trail.
 A
ft r
 
as closely as we can figure, she was fourteen, which is prett
 
old and I think it's a mercy she died as peacefully as she did.
 
'
et (a really nice person) called me about eleven o
'clock that ni -

erecking Otter, found she was going.
 She gave her some oxycen and

 I will be delighted when it i

over.
 One week after getting Naomi and Corey off for Europe, Nic
 
a d I went up to Idyliwild for two weeks.
 One week after we got bac
 
left for Newport, NewYork, Boston and points east, meeting Corey
 
d flying home with her.
 She looked tired but in pretty good spirit
 
.
 heat really got us both down; I had forgotten how bad it was w
 
e humidity was so high and I just dripped the whole time.
 Our
 
t
ree days in town we mostly ran around keeping up with Alan, seei
 
an Carey, who was the delight of our whole trip from my point o
 
H
 W,  and trying to get along with Anne who was in a bad state.
 A
 
:Ad me, and please keep this to yourself, since Iam not clear whe:.
 
is for f
± public news or not, that she had taken an over-dose o
 
.
eeping pills the week Corey was in Boston and had to be hospitaliz
 
r several days.
 It would surely seem to me -
-
 apparently this is
 
the first time, by any manner of means -
-
 that some sort of hor
 
aU therapy would be the thing for her.  Anyway, she was trying to
 
sweet and succeeded most of the time; I think she actually trier

October 25, 1963
 
Dearest Shirley, U
rnpty, Margaret, all neices, nephews and kind friends:
 
I hardly ever a resort to the carbon copy system, as you know,
 
but I owe everybody a letter -
-
 not to say two or three -
-
 and I am just
 
too busy (and too much of a chatter-box when I start writing) to get off
 
two letters today.
 
Our life this last month has been filled with one thing
 
after another and there appears to be no let up.
 In the first place
 
a standard looking letter from the Republic Bank arrived about three
 
weeks ago which, on being opened, proved to contain not only some more
 
Republic Bank stock but also a check for five thousand dollars, closing
 
Deanie's will.  We all though it should have at least been sent in a
 
gold- line(I envelope, if the Bank didn't want to be a ostentatious
 
on the outside.  I went around a day or two cussing myself for not
 
having discussed the stock business I wrote Umpty about with the Bank
 
before the settlement, and meanwhile stashed the f*vw check in the
 
savings account for safe-keeping.  However
  
At this point in our exciting saga, I have to digress
 
with an item that happened way back last summer; our landlord noti-
fied us out of the blue that he had sold our house to new owners - -

the neighborhood indicated that the W
.S.&M. Corp was acting as a holding
 
company for Sears, which has been gradually buying Up property around
 
here for a long time.  Another school of thought held that the Corp.
 
was buying in so as to be able to sell the State Highways Commission
 
a package of land around the oncoming freeway exit.
 
Anyway, two weeks ago, I came home at 1
1;OO p
.n. one
 
evening from a class to find that we had received a formal notice to
 
dispossess the house within thirty days.  We checked around with various
 
lawyers and were advised to go ahead and start looking for a place but
 
not to get too hysterical about the dispossess notice, as it seemed un-
likely that they would come in and start tearing things down right away.
 
Besides, at Chavez Ravine before the Didgers could move in, the bull-
dozers were kept at bay for over two years by a few Mexican families
 
who patiently declined to be evicted.  So we resisted the urge to
 
jitter and started looking for another place to rent,
 
at this
 
point
 
Our chief decision kaxtktaxk*wa was not to move out of
 
Santa Monica because of the kids; Naomi is a senior and Nicka sophomore
 
(we have a three year high school out here, so this means he has just
 
started).  The S M. High School is not the absolute marvel of the wor
ld,
 
but general opinion holds that it is much better than the high schools
 
of the surrounding area.  Naomi, as a senior, could conti nue  there  even
 
if we moved out of the district but even so would have to be hauled to
 
school and back.  Nick, whose academic standing has always been preca-
rious, seems to have settled in reasonably happily and is actually bringing
 
home some good grades.  He is crazy about Latin, incidentally, and talks
 
now of adding one or two more languages before he leaves high school and
 
becoming a linguist eventually.
 (Time, may I say, will tell.)
 
So, we commenced looking.
 It was rapidly born in on us
 
that renting a three bedroom place in Santa Monica would run us two
 
;
.
-uadred to two ivacired fifty a o
:iti if  ot
 $i
 ore we
 
a
nd talked to prospective landlords the more we thought of buying.
 
.
o, we finally took the plunge and in three weeks or so, you should
 
e addressing us at 2227 24th Street, Santa Monica.  tsutak  (Or, a
.
 
utch usually says, twenty-two, twenty-seven, twenty-fourth, hike!)
 
T
t seems a kind of crazy time for us to buy, at a period while the
 
family is
 
 
arra  ement.
 
In the first  Lacc,  I t
cin.c -
-
 ad variou&
-  eu
e C U
t
LL
 
i
s a very good and eminently a salable property.
 I
t is two blocks
 
from a grammar school on a dead end street which ends up at the sc .
.
'
 
7layground, and about ten blocks from the oncoming freeway (which
 
robably bring many prospective kuy New S
.M. residents in its wake - 
oeople who want to live x in the beach area but who couldn't face th€.
 
daily drive downtown to work.  Secondly, the house is in superb condi
 
tion; beautifully kept up with a new modern kitchen (
the first I have
 
ever cooked in) -
-
 disposal, wall oven, built-in range.  The forier
 
i
wners, who built the house, put in a half bath a year ago betwc
 
'itchen and one of the bedrooms and at that time replaced all
 
Lumbing in the house, including the pipes underneath the house.
 
he house has living room, a full bath with tub and separate sta
 
shower plus a half bath, three bedrooms, a nice sunny breakfast roo
 
md a kind of in between waste space room which really, I guess should
 
ae a dining room, but I have a horrible feeling will turn out to be
 
of place where everybody dumps their things.
 I may fence it off.
 
he backyard contains two very unusual structures -
-
 a goofy kind of
 
a grown-up play house with a concrete floor and wood siding containin L 
a concrete waist-high barbecue ñ xt deal and  a small sink.  I will
 
robably use that as my office, though we could perfectly well put Nic
 
here for increased privacy; this will come, I believe, at a later da
 
either Butch nor I feel that additional privacy is what Nick needs
 
a
t the moment.  The other thing is a large well constructed two c
 
:
arage with a slab concrete floor and a perfectly enorrnouo unfini
 
room off to the side -
-
 16 by 24 -
-
 complete with windows and goo'
 
concrete floor.  We plan to put in gradually over the next while
 
a couple of dead windows for more light, lay asphalt tile on the [
lc
 
and put up wall board (
it * has no interior siding) and convert it
 
to a rumpus room which can be used, if Butch wants to or we find we
 
cannot afford t9xkzimjFxktxxaxxAJ=xtknxa his current studio rental, fcr
 
a very good studio.  This maneuver would cut our ovcr'l'
 yentS
 
r
i about what we are paying out in rental now.
 
inartcially speaking, Umpty, we got advised o.
 
i
ut down more than we had to to get the place; this is the kind of
 
advice I don't understand, being the type who always feels better
 T 
I pay cash.  However, we have done this -
-
 with firm su pp ort  not  to  
say heavy pushing by various friends who are in real estate here -
-
we paid ten percent do n (out of our five thousand) and have a bank
 
loan of eighty percent føz at five per cent for thirty years which ic
 
* k *R payable at twenty per cent of the ttat balance per month, i
 
we want to pay it a all off at some point.
 (As I understand it, w e
 
could then pay the entire note off in five months if we cared to do s
..)
 
I am told the terms of this loan are excellent, and ma according to te
 
that say they know, ind cate that the bank thinks we have a very good
 
buy here.  Then we have a second trust deed at six percent for five
 
years.  This is the part that i ai not convinced of -
-
 we could get
 
x away not ta in  that at all..
,
 
a small amount of stock to do so, considering the extra expenses in-
volved in buying, moving and getting the place in the final shape we'd
 
like it in.
 Everybody we have consulted on this says that you should
 
have as little capital tied up in real estate as possible (unless you
 
are in the business) and that what we should do is to pay off the second
 
trust deed as we go, then at the end of five years when we come to the
 
balloon payment, re-finance Ix the house and go on from there.  This
 
kind of thing, I suppose, is what makes the wheels of progress go round,
 
but I do not particularly want them to go right over us.  Old Financier
 
U
tnpty, does this sound sensible to you?  Actually, I think the only
 
thing we have to worry about is if the whole real estate picture in
 
Santa Monica fell apart with a depression or something -
-
 and this
 
still seems unlikely to hurt us to me.
 There are lots of people in L
.A.
 
who have absolutely pots of money and who seem willing to pay it to
 
live close to the beach and the new marina they're building close by.
 
Anyway, our escrow closes December 5th -
-
 the sellers are in
 
their house and have to evict somebody else to move to their new place -
-
and we keep getting nasty letters from the Western Steel and Metals
 
Corp that we should hand over the keys on November 15th.  We have informed
 
them both pleasantly and unpleasantly that this would be extremely
 
inconvenient; at the moment there is a stand-still in our correspondence.
 
Anyway, if you see a story in the papers headed some
thing  lik e "Woman
 
Holds off Bulldozers With Shotgun", it, will probably be me.  Do you
 
think, on second consideration, Sears would sell us a shotgun to skun
 
shoot them with? -
-
 we don;t seem to have one around the house.
 
In the meantime life goes on as usual.  Corey phoned to ask if
 
she can bring her boyfriend home for Thanksgiving; he is the son of a
 
UCLA professor who has forbidden the boy to ever darken his door again.
 
She also wants to move in to an apartment in January.  Oh wise women,
 
how would you handle these problems?  Naomi is trying to decide where
 
she wants to go to college and is sending off frantic applications for
 
housing here and there.
 I have a strong hunch she will wind up at
 
Berkeley too; her academic average went down to a B last year because
 
of all the Europe hullab*aloo and I do not think she has much chance for
 
a tuitional scholarship at a private college.
 Since she is still set on
 
a medical career, i it seems to us rather foolish to blow our wad on
 
her undergraduate education -
-
 especially since she will have eight (
!)
 
more years after graduation and the Berkeley pre-med program seems highly
 
ranked by the best medical schools.  Nick is in the process of flunking
 
Drivers Education while making A
's and B
's in Geometry, Latin and such
 
frivolous topics.
 I am so annoyed with him.
 I have been trying to sell
 
him on just trying to get past the silly course, because it is required
 
but he just looks at me with this limpid gaze and remarks k  
-that it;s
 
so stupid he goes to sleep in class (and  oesn '
t ever
 hear  the ass
ign -
ments, the silly goose).
 I hasten to state this is not Drivers Training;
 
they xv never get behind the wheel -
-
 ju s
t take an  en tire  semester
 to  
worry the California Highway Code into their heads; heck, they could
 
memorize it in two weeks and in some respects I sympathize with
 
position.
 
Well, I must stop and cope.
 Sorry to have been so long in writing
 
and so long-winded when I did start.
 "
t
argaret, I hope you will have some
 
chance for peace and a rest this year; of all people I know you deserve

earest Umpty and i
largaret,
 
Well the date is all set (
assuming you
 
got our previous letter and know what I am talking about) and the
 
wedding will come off June 19th -
-
 not only Fathers' Day but, if
 
I am not incorrect June-teenth (or is that the 17th?).
 You will
 
get a formal invitation as soon as I can get down to the printers
 
and get the operation underway, but in the meantime, consider your-
selves all invited and see what you en can do about it...
 
1 It will be a hassle.
 The kids want to
 
get married at a Unitarian Church out in the vatim Valley; they like
 
the minister and they like the church -
-
 a strange looking affair
 
on the in outside looking something like a brown onion but really
 
quite nice on the inside.
 They everyone, I suppose will trek
 
fifteen miles or so on the freeway back here for a reception and
 
party.  Since Mike's mothers' list is 58 (
!), almost entirely elderly
 
and wealthy relatives who must be invited or they will be insulted,
 
we will,  I
'm afraid have a large and unhandy affair, but I am determined
 
to relax and enjoy it and not worry about whether the place isn't too
 
small and whether or not I oughtn't g to get in caterers and all that.
 
All Mike and Corey seem to care about is that we have to have cham-
pagne and in bottles and pop them -
-
 nof
leof that punch jazz -
-
 so
 
it's their wedding and we will have great big-
bottles of cham'pagne
 
and Fred Katz is bringing some of his friends to play for dancing
 
on the concrete in front of the garage and it should be very gay.
 
I don't know at the moment how the kids'
 
plans are coming for their trip and all.
 They want very much to go
 
to Europe, but may not be able to swing it financially.
 
I am going to call tomorrow ± night and hooe to find out what's up.
 
In any event they will settle in Berkeley and for at least a year
 
though Mike has applied to Harvard and Cornell for graduate studies.
 
Corey will try to race through her teaching credential and I hope will
 
have a year or two's experience before they settled down to having ti
 
their family.  They are starting off very well equipped.  Mike's sister
 
gave Corey a shower and some friends of mine another, s and I now know
 
where all my ft friends got all their fancy jazz for giving parties
 
and dinners and all.
 Butch and I got married all the wrong way, as far
 
as equipping a household goes; Corey already has more miscellaneous
 
stuff than I acquired the first ten years of our married life!
 Oh well,
 
r can always borrow from my daughter.
 
In between all this, I am teaching, making
 
speeches hand over fist, trying to finish an article for Western Folk-
lore and hopefully finishing the Bessie book.
 I have about come to
 
the conclusion that I will have to type and hand-copy it myself; nobody
 
else really understands me! and I keep editing and editing so that nothin
 
ever really gets finished.
 The President of Valley State finally
 
after much hassle, student petitions, threatened demonstrations, rx
 
letters etc. etc. etc. renewed my contract for another year.
 I
'd just
 
as soon not e accept, but we'll see.  He has saved face by stipulatina
 
that I undertake the acquiring of a masters degree (
 a point which
 
had never come up during my past eight years on campus), and at this
 
particular point in my life, I
'm not sure I want to do it.  Maybe as
 
the fall rolls around I will, but at the moment I have too many other
 
things I want to do rather than take a bunch of graduate classes.
 
Naomi may get down to your neck of the woods this su m me r.
 
She has been offered a camp counsellors job in New Mexico for six
 
weeks and then plans to spend all the dough she makes on a fast trip
 
to New York, passing possibly through Houston en route.
 It's not cer-
tain, so don't get alarmed yet.
 She is really quite a marvellous
 
erson; I wish we didn't
 t see each other so seldom, so you would
 
have a chance to see how what a wonderful kid she's turned out to
 
be.
 Corey is in very good shape too; Nick I think has turned the
 
adolescent corner -
-
 or is peeking around it -
-
 and has changed greatly
 
u during the past six months.  He and I drove up to San Francisco
 
last week where I attended a seminar on games and play in relation
 
to the Bessie book sponsored by an inter-disciplinary group of scholars
 
very exciting, and Nick took over all the masculine functions for me.
 
Very pleasant, since Butch at the last minute couldn't come.  He's
 
doing jury duty and for the first time in I six months a case dragged
 
o n  till Thursday, so he had to stay home and render his verdict proper-
ly.  He's on Municipal Rt Court panel and so only sits on traffic and
 
small liability cases -
-
 rather dull, but he's relieved.  He is actu-
ally enjoying the experience, as I thought he mi,ht, no and i
nstructs
 
us nightly in the finer points of the law.
 
Well, this is letter-writing day, so I must get on to
 
my ne'zt.
 Love to you all and write when you have time.  How is
 
Jo h n ny  -
-
 as  a  mat te r  of  fac t,  how is everybody?

Dear Dorry,  I miss you here.
 Your right thinking,
 
your open heart,  your responsiblemess in acting
 
on your loving were central  in my life and central
 
in the family I always enjoyed and still  love.
 
I miss being in touch with Bess,  Ellen,  Corey,
 
Naomi,  Nick,  Cristy,  even my own children.
 It was
 
easier when you & Bill were here;  you were centri-
petal.
 
It's one hundred years  today since you were born
 
in Northampton.
 Thanks  for your life
 love, Anne
 
Dear Bess,
 
I miss you.
 I think of
 
you with love.
 So happy
 
to hear from you at Christ-
mas;  I misplaced your ad
 
dress in my noncurrent book
 
in moving.
 I' m living in
 
the country,  with my woman
 
partner,  in the house Suzanne
 
bought about the time Dorry
 
died.
 We aretrenovating?) no,
 
really finishing the house,  &
 
there's  sawdust all  over.
 
But we're having fun.

After moving to Vermont in
 
'85,  I researched & drew up
 
a proposal  for the city of Burlington  for a comprehensive
 
sexual assault prevention program.
 After completing that
 
I' ve been doing office work and a little political  writing
 
for our Vt gay & lesbian newspaper.
 Just this past year
 
I have remembered how very much I love my music.
 I had been
 
teaching myself to play piano by ear.
 I started practi±ing
 
drums again.
 I think you knew that in  '77-80 in MA I
 
taught music,  after my year of training at the Kodaly Inst?
 
Now I' m remembering how much I loved teaching and how good
 
my classes were.
 So I' m organizing independent classes
 
& applying for substitute school music teaching and teaching
 
in community colleges.
 Please,  wish me well  in this adventure!
 
Thanks!
 
Are Naomi & John in Nepal now?
 Did the whole  family go?
 
I see Marianne in Boston & Claire at Wesleyan U in CT.
 Don't
 
see Suzanne much;  she is in Berkeley
 
L
 happy & well.
 
It makes me smile to think of you.
 What are you doing &
 
thinking these days?
 How are you?
 Can we hang out & catch
 
up sometime?
 
Happy Dorry's birthday!
 
Love,

li by h ing fort'in t
 enough to be �

z
hom I coild watch and who would occasionally show me a  f e w  thb
 .
 
It has always seemed to riO  that most guitar teachers teach more
'
 
than their students want to know;  I hav  met far too many peop
 
who started out on an expensive guitar course and dropped it  x
t n
 
in discouragement over technical difficulties. I have worked out
 
my teaching methods ectir,g on th  assumption that most people wart
.
 
to learn guitar (or banjo or mandolin) nxzxzxoa±K1 for their own
 
nersonal and social kicks ani that they want to have fun doing it.
 
The imaginary student for whom I plin my classes is a hard-workin.
 
citizen with a full time
 
job and allitional community responsibiiit
 
who xxxkx enjoys getting together with his friends once a week  n [
 
making some music and who wants at the same time to learn enou
 
on a simple i
ri tru,en
to be able to take it along to th  beach
 
eni accompany   
 
singing. This guy has little spare tir  to
 
practice so I plan long lessons -
-
 two to two and a half fours -
-
so that he con get a good work-out at least once a week. He probablg
 
has no
 xi  technical musical background so I use no written music,
 
only s
ong sheets, ani teach the fun amentals of harmony by ear ar
 
with the minimum of technical language. He is ghy about his music l
 
"ignorance" so I teach in large groups -
-
 ten to t wenty -
-
 whor
 
he can relax into the group and have fun without hearing his oam
 
early clinkers an:i participate from the beginning in rounds ant
 
part sin ing without worrying over his "lack of voice".
 
x
 
He is a social guy so
 
I stress right from the beginning ways to use both instruments o
r
 
voice in smaller groups;  I mnsioxx teach guitar, banjo, mandolin
 
ani an occasional ukelele student all together and urge, on the
 
frequent occasions when I have sevexral members of a family in th
 
same class, that they take up different instruments and work up
 
their own family hand. Incident5 liy th  hulk of my students are
 
married co'iples and in three cia '
s
 
exc
,
t1nf
l  f t m smallest kids.
 
T
his sounds as though 1 f
'inctiori mostl  as a song 1o J r
 
or so
 thing rather than as a guitar teacher.  I guess this is true
 
to a certain extent; my experience has he
 that technical dif f
lculti'
 
smooth th e
mselves out in time without too much hammering away by
 
the teacher; the main problem i
s getting everybody to play. I do ha v e
 
'
iuite a few really serious instrumentalists. Some of them are taking
 
lessons from classical guitar teachers as well, and I encourage this.
 
In
 class I have
 goinr now that has been meeting fx emxxx  for o er
 
a Year,
 exwi  I should say th e students learn equally as much from
 
each other as they do from me and class time is to a good cetent taken

Dear Pat and Lisa and Bob,
 
First, I must thank you for all the nice things you've
 
been sending me -
-
 theJ5k1rt (
which fits wonderfully) and
 
the various pant-socks and the crossword puzzles.  All
 
have been greatly enjoyed.
 
I keep calling Shirley as often as I can.  She seems in pretty
 
fair shape, though I think she is in danger of getting
 
discouraged, because l
ife is so daily and so difficult at
 
that.  Mostly, I think she needs to be needed -
-
 like anybody
 
e
lse -
-
 and the difficulty is to think of the needs that itxNmx
 
wouldn't be too hard on her A to fulfill.  Tgx This is why
 
Alan and I have been urging her to go to Austin to try to
 
get father's and Deanie's papers in order.  This is something
 
that she alone can do -
-
 with some help, of course -
-
 and we
 
have been trying to convince her to take it on.
 
Well, you know more about her state of mine than I do.  I am
 
urging her to think about a Caribbean Vacation during October
 
or November (
when I can get a week or two off).  She does
 
l
ove thee ocean and the snorkelling, and I have been thinking
 
that, if we could find a pleasant spot a bit closer than our
 
other voyages, VOC we might be able to locate a house, or
 
a houseboat or something 1that she and Alan and I could go in
 
on, so that she could stay down there part of the year and
 
we could all come and visit hwr.  She may not, of course,
 
want to leave Lubbock and her friends, but still it seems to
 
me that any kind of plan beats a blank...
 
Maybe six months or so in Austin and another in the Caribbean,
 
perhaps the Baklamas...
 She has said to me several times that
 
she doesn't see why she has to live somewhere where she doesn't
 
feel good when there are places where her knees stop hurting a
 
and she can enjoy herself.  Wouldn't it be fun if we could all
 
go to visit her some pretty place in those beautiful waters?
 
With Shirley l
iving there most of the year round and enjoying
 
herself?  Well, I
'm beginning to sound l
ike Alan
 long on
 
the romance and short on the practicality.  Even so...
 
I hope things are coming along well for you all, and that
 
all of your various enterprises are coming along.me W  Myself ,
 
I
'm set for an extremely busy summer -
-
 California, Oregon,
 
M&ine, Tennessee are in my immediate future.  Maybe one of
 
these days this list will include Iowa RxA and I can get by
 
for a visit.
 I
'll hope so.
 
Till then, ±xR take care of yourselves.  Much love.

Subject:  Birthday Greetings
 
Dear M:
 
Many,  many congratulations and good wishes on your birthday.
 
What better way to spend it than jetboating up the rapids in New
 
Zealand?
 Or are you spending it eating salty seabirds?
 
Whatever you're doing,  I trust the company is congenial,  the
 
surroundings stunning,  and the weather warm and balmy.
 I am told
 
that it's summer in New Zealand.. .<sigh>. .  .  It was *m inus
_40* this
 
morning as  I walked to work!
 
I am joined in these greetings of course by Lisa,  who tells
 
me to pass along the news that  "Squirt"  (as she calls her work in
 
progress)  is in fine form.  In fact,  at our last doctor's visit it
 
was wriggling around so much it was hard to keep track of.
 Lisa
 
dreamed last night that she had the amniocentesis:  they told her
 
that the baby was  fine and that it was a boy.
 She said she liked
 
the dream so much she went right back to sleep and dreamed it two
 
more times!
 
Much love and good wishes to you  (
and to Naomi,  too)

To the family and friends of Dewey Williams:
 
I first met Deacon Williams twenty-five years ago at t
iie
 
Festival of American Folklife on the National Mall in Washington,  D.C.,
 
where he stood directly in the shadow of the Washington Monument and
 
led his friends in programs of inspired songs that could have lifted
 
the heart of the Great Imancipator, Abraham Lincoln, himself.
 Many
 
people who come to Washington seem a bit stunted and diminished by
 
comparison with our national heroes,  but Dewey Williams always stood
 
tall,  confident,  and proud in their company.
 
Today,  as we mourn our loss and grieve with his family,  we
 
need also to remember that Dewey Williams lived his whole life with
 
joyful vigor, with energy,  and with great style.
 In nw mind Y  eye,
 
I always see him marching inside the square,
 bound for the prom ised
 
land,"  leading his singers,  his steps a bit slower as he aged but always
 
with that hint of elegance and verve,
 He always knew just exactly
 
where he was going,  and he gloried in the journey.
 
As we prepare to follow him,  I hope we can follow his example
 
as well,  remembering how he caught hold of his life and infused it with
 
his own unconquerable spirit,  his especial determination and grace.
 
Goodbye and God bless you, Mr.  Dewey.
 May every one of us who have
 
learned so much from you  live out our own lives as well as you have
 
lived yours.

I

So, here I

 I

even b

The l
ast t

hat we met, was a
t t

f your donated a

t
o CSUN--otherwise known a

what my d

t
 a

eminds me o

ate 60's o

arly
 
70'sby a
 r
owdy g
roup o
f f
un-loving young male s

Other t
unes and v
isions permeate my memories. You, p
icking up your
 
guitar, l
ooking up, and s
tarting "
Stewball" while we a
l
l y
earned t
o j
oin-in
 
a
nd s
ing a
long--as we o
ften d
id. Sometimes you would s
i
t a
s I
 r
ecall, and
 
s
lowly unwrap your package o
f c
igarettes (
we were s
t
ill a
l
lowed t
o smoke
 
i
n c
lass during t
hose days)--thinking o
f what you n
ext would s
ay. There
 
was t
he f
amiliar s
equence o
f c
losing t
he package c
ellophane, t
amping
 
down t
he c
igarette (
I
 t
hink t
hey were S
alem's), putting t
he l
i
ght away. An
 
ongoing r
i
tual amongst many I
 r
emember a
s s
o c
omforting.
 
We c
hatted and yakked about your b
rother A
lan, t

he
 
Weaver's, o
r who d
id t
he most a
uthentic v
ersion o
f S
henandoah--
depending on where i
t
 was s
ung a
nd by whom. I
 d
id a
 paper on
 
S
henandoah and t

f s
ea c

I
 l
oved t

 l
ooked f

 missed
 
you s
o when you l

very once i

B
arbara would get i
n t
ouch t

doing a
t t

 p
robably would have c

 d
