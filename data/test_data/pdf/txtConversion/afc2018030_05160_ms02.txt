These shelves hold both finished and unfinished pots. The light pink-ish colored pieces toward the top right are 
bisque ware, which has been fired once, but still needs to have glaze applied before it is fired a final time.

Two wood fired pots sit on a shelf in Delores Fortuna’s studio. Although her own kiln needs repairs and she has 
not fired it recently, she has often wood fired over the course of her career.
