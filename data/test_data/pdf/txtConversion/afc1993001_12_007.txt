The greatest amount of credit for this report on the Oskars Kalpaks
 
Latvian Saturday School in Wauwatosa goes to the very people it concerns--
the Milwaukee area Latvian community. Their graciousness, hospitality,
 
and full-hearted support for the Ethnic Schools Project made all the
 
difference in the world to the final outcome of the Project. As for
 
the fieldworker, he benefited more than he hoped:  for awhile I was
 
part of a community of very warm and generous people, and I was very
 
happy to be their school's chronicler for a few short, but exciting,
 
weeks. Even more so, as a Lithuanian, I was proud to be able to work
 
with people from my brother nation (bralu tauta). Finally, of all the
 
people I met in  the  Latvian community, one deserves special mention--
I mean, of course, Ilga Strazdi Ã . She was one of the very first
 
Latvians I met in M ilwaukee. And it was her enthusiasm for the Projec:,
 
especially her love for her culture and country, that excited me and
 
paved the road and opened many doors during my fieldwork. Without
 
Ilga's boundless energy in being my guide through her community,
 
this Project would not have recorded as much as it did. She is also
 
the kind of person whose concern for all people proves to be infectious
 
and inspiring: through Ilga's eyes the world blossoms with possibilities
 
for a deeply felt and rich life. I spent many hours listening to Ilga
 
as she unfolded the joy and the pain in her heart of being alive, of being
 
a Latvian. May all fieldworkers have such a companion.
 
History of the Latvian Nation
  
Latvia, along with its two neighbors, Estonia and Lithuania, lies
 
along the western shore of the Baltic Sea. Its area of 25,000 square
 
S 
ES$2: Ri ardas Viduti.s
 2
 
miles is about the size of Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island
 
and Vermont combined. Finland and Sweden are to the north; to the
 
southwest is Poland; and the Soviet Union lies to the east.
 
The capital city of R!ga is situated at the mouth of the River
 
Daugava on the Gulf of Riga. The capital was founded in 1201 and is
 
Latvia's industrial, cultural and shipping center.
 
Latvians belong to the Baltic branch of the Indo-European family
 
of nations and are distinct from the Slavic and Germanic peoples.
 
The Baits settled the western shores of the Baltic about 4
,000 years
 
ago.
 
Forming an almost natural threshold between West and Fast Europe,
 
Latvia has felt the onslaught of foreign armies for hundreds of years.
 
In 1795,
 Latvia was absorbed by Imperial Russia and held for over
 
one hundred years. The Russian Empire collapsed during World War I.
 
This enabled many nations of Pastern Europe to gain independence.
 
On November 18, 1918 an independent and democratic republic of
 
Latvia was proclaimed. By 1920 a peace treaty was signed with the
 
Soviet Union which renounced forever any territorial claims to
 
Latvian soil. But independence lasted only 20 years. In June of
 
l9 O Latvia was once again invaded by Russian troops following the
 
Molotov-Ribbentrop pact which carved out spheres of influence between
 
Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union.
 
In the +
3 years of occupation the Soviets have followed a policy
 
of ethnic dilution whereby large numbers of non-Latvians have been
 
brought in to settle among the local population of Latvians. The
 
effect of this policy has been to make Latvians an eventual  minority
 
in their own country. The number of Latvians in Latvia today is about
 
03 : Ri arda.s  T
izju i.s
 
The first Latvians to settle in North America did so in 1
638 in
 
Delaware Bay. By 1892 the oldest Latvian civic group formed the
 
Philadelphia Society of Free Letts. And by the end of the first
 
two decades of the 20th century, the number of Latvians in the United
 
States increased to about 30,000. This was a reflection of the
 
economic, military and political events in Eastern Europe during this
 
time. During the time of independence only 6
66 Latvians emigrated
 
to the United States, but once ,or1d War II arrived and independence
 
was lost, some 200,000 Latvians were displaced from their land. These
 
people were exiles who chose no: to return to Latvia which was under
 
Russian occupation. Of the 200,000 who fled their land, the largest
 
group eventually settled in the United States, while others formed
 
exile communities in Australia, Canada, England, Sweden, Germany,
 
Venezuela, and other countries. And of those who cane to the United
 
States, about 3000 LntJinnc nn

and following the war, reduced the population by about 25%. Those who
 
fled their homeland carry with them the knowledge that Latvian culture
 
is in a fragile and waning state. They fear that the Soviet policies
 
of Russification of their homeland will eventually lead to the ethnicide
 
of their culture. Most Latvian exiles know that the extinction of their
 
culture is a direct possibilit -.
. It is this knowledge and fear that
 
shapes the philosophical content of the emigre school system, and it
 
is the same fear that contributes to the dialogue between different
 
Latvian generations concerning the maintenance of ethnic culture in exile. i

In Milwaukee, the Ethnic Schools Project has recorded not just another
 
ethnic school system, but the crisis between generations over the proper
 
maintenance of Latvian culture in exile, a culture which may prove to
 
be the final vestige of the one brought from the homeland.
 
History of the Milwaukee Latvian Cornnunity  
The largest concentration of Latvians in Wisconsin is found in the
 
Milwaukee area. The Milwaukee Latvian colony also acts as a cultural
 
center for other small outlying Latvian communities in the cities of
 
Waukesha, Minominee Falls, Shorewood, Fond du Lac, and the farming
 
area of La Crosse. Following World War II, a couple of very active
 
Latvian families supported their emigre brothers and sisters to come
 
to Milwaukee. One such family, the Kazaks, brought -
fOO-500 Latvians
 
to Milwaukee from their initial work contracts in Mississippi. Prior
 
to their arrival there was no Latvian community in Milwaukee, but,
 
curiously, the oldest Latvian community in the States was founded
 
around 1900 in Irma, Wisconsin about lO miles to the north.
 
In its heyday of about 1956-68, the Latvian commuritv in Milwaukee
 
numbered approximately 3,000. Today that number has dropped to some-
where between 600 and 1,000. The growth  of the Latvian community
 
in Milwaukee since the 1950's has not resulted in ghetto clusters
 
of Latvians. Instead, the settlement patterns are d
if
fuse within the
 
city of Milwaukee and surrounding the city. The scattered nature 0:
 
the Latvian
 settlement can be explained by the kind of people t
.
 
exiles were--a highly educated elite upper class who could function
 
in any capacity of American society. For them isolation would be a
 
disadvantage, while mobility would reflect an educathnal background
 
E582: Riiardas Vidutis
 5
 
that allowed the exile to move to where the job was, or, because of
 
financial success, to move to more preferred outlying living areas.
 
About 25 years ago a small T
.
.tvian community developed from Mauston
 
north to Wisconsin Rapids and west near to Sparta with Tomah as the
 
focal point. This area is about 3 1/2 hours by car from Milwaukee.
 
In this area there are 8
-ia Latvian farms along with a few more
 
Latvians living in the periphery.
 
The Latvian exile community's concern with maintaining their
 
cultural heritage had its roots immediately following World War II
 
in Displaced Persons (DP Camps)throughout Western Europe. Most Latvians
 
(
75%) who fled communist occupied Latvia ended up in the occupied
 
sectors of 3ermany. Most Latvians believed that they would eventually
 
return to the homeland. In the mean time life had to go on in the
 
DP Camps; the culture had to continue, especially the education
 
of the children who one day would be returning. In the camps a
 
school system was created to function as a logical extension of that
 
interest in the homeland. By 191+
5 there were 294 DP Camps registering
 
82,000 Latvians in the three occupied sectors of Western Germany. 2 And
 
by 191+
6/1
+7, 11,200 students were attending 224 schools in the Camps
 
and were being taught by 1,073 teachers. 3 With the establishment of
 
the DP CamDs, the education of the children continued with the schools
 
reflecting,  in miniture, the educational system in pre-war Latvia.
 
By around :950
 most of the schools had closed down in Germany because
 
of the final relocation of T
ian exiles to host countries such as
 
the United States.
 
Latvian DP's arrived in large numbers in Milwaukee in 1950 -51.

By January of 1951 the now defunct Wisconsin Latvian Association
 
sponsored the establishment of a Latvian school system. Often held
 
in rented churches, even in private homes, the early locations of
 
the Latvian school changed place about nine times. In 1962 the
 
present location in Wauwatosa was chosen at St. John's Evangelical
 
Lutheran Latvian Church. Two Latvian congregations share the church
 
a
rid both offer free use of the church facilities (including utilities)
 
to the school. The school does not belong to the church but is
 
administered by parents of the two parishes of St. John's.

The Latvian School is held in Wauwatosa at St. John's. The church
 
complex
 (originally owned by German Baptists) is the oldest church in
 
Wauwatosa. Wauwatosa is physically adjacent to Milwaukee.
 
The building structure is made up of a church sec t
hn plus a back
 
section a
gned to classrooms. The school portion of the building
 
complex consists of five classrooms upstairs, two on the main floor
 
and two in the basement; each grade, beginning with the kindergarten
 
class, has its own room. The basement area, and the seventh grade room
 
on the main floor are also used "or dance practice and si: bin .
 
Adjacent to the seventh grade room is the kindergarten pl

Hare the children can sit at tables as they work or they can lourne
 
on the floor as they play. The classrooms upstairs are all s

with about 5-6 students in each grade. The upstairs also houses
 
z
i-
school library which has a small selection of books in Latvian
 
available for loan to the students. There are 17 teachers, including
 
substitutes, who teach aporoximately 4

His:cry of St. John's Evangelical Lutherai Latvian Church
  
Five pastors arrived with the exile I, tvians to Milwaukee in the
 
ear
-j 1950's. Each pastor brought with them a constituency and loyal
 
fol:o ing. The allegiances and loyalties were kept from Latvia and
 
Germany. This was the beginning of the problem of having too many
 
congregations for too few people. Pastor allegiance dates back to
 
Latvia when people alligned themselves with pastors who shared similar
 
interests be it academic, work, or sorority of fraternity affiliations.
 
Pastor allegiance was one way of maintaining former associations and

frie: ships from Latvia. Even
tua ll y,  due  to vocat
ional
 changes
 and  
moving away, the number of pastors narrowed down to three. To this
 
day there are three separate congregations in Milwaukee. Two Congre-
gations share the church in Wauwatosa and a third is in Milwaukee's
 
near south side. The building was purchased about 20-25 years ago
 
from a German Baptist congregations. It was decided that the two
 
congregations would buy one building because each separat a
ly was not
 
f:nanci a
lly strong enough to buy their own church.

Curriculum Materials
  
During the early years of Oskars Kalpaks, materials and books
 
from Latvia and those produced at the DP Camps were used to teach
 
students. Many of the books were published in Germany after the
 
war. By the early 1950's some texts were being printed in the United
 
States. And according to Eriks KrUmi; , today the American Latvian
 
Association is the largest publisher of educa t
hnal materials in the
 
free world serving 200,000 Latvians in North America. 16 The American
 
Latvian Association works together with the Canadian LA to produce
 
textbooks that are used by Latvians throughout the free world. Books
 
are chosen by teachers during a semi-monthly teachers' meeting to
 
discuss text availability, and also, the general course of instruc-
tion and the educational progress of the students. At the end of
 
each year, the curriculum materials are reviewed. 17
 
Although textbooks are not mandator:,  3c1e

purchase all textbooks except for religious books which are lent

are used in the designated grade levels, some teachers chose not to
 
use them and may even provide their own materials. According to the
 
opinion of a number of teachers, there are a few texts that are not
 
graded well enough for today's students; for example, texts on

Latvian agriculture are too difficult for today's students. The
 
assumption is that students know the language and should start reading
 
any text. This assumption may be too optimistic. In some cases,
 
teachers may allow translations rather than explain the Latvian terms.
18  
Some ex-students of Oskars Kalpaks remember the early days of the
 
Latvian School in Milwaukee with a bit of regret. Ilga Strazdi; , who
 
today teaches the kindergarten class at Oskars Kalpaks, remembers
 
those early days: "It was terrible. The curriculum was simply read
 
and answer questions and memorize, memorize and recite from poems
 
and proverbs. That was the kind of curriculum we dealt with in the
 
1950 s.,,
 19 She continues: "What was important then, in the curriculum,
 
was strictly Latvian, Latvian, Latvian--you spoke Latvian, you thought
 
Latvian, you read Latvian. Most of them /the authors/ were terribly
 
dull and complex to somebody that age. I was bored to death of Latvian
 
School. I didn't like it." 
20 It was not until the l9 0's that the
 
curriculum started to change. The ALA started to realize that the
 
students who arrived at the summer high school at Garezers  were
 
unequally prepared. Even though everyone should have had equal prepa-
ration at their local schools, the actual levels of competence varied
 
greatly. This made it difficult to coordinate a high school program
 
at Garezers. By the end of the 1960's the ALA had reformulated the
 
curriculum so that every local Latvian school would be able to foll w
 
a universaI curriculum. 21
 
The problems of the early years stem from the kind of cultural
 
Latvian who arrived in Milwaukee. Many of the children who potentially
 
would have been students spent their formative years in Latvia or
 
Germany. When they arrived in North America, many were about 8-15 years
 
ES82: Ri ardas Vidu t43
 
old which meant that they already spoke Latvian. Parents assumed that
 
there was no need to attend Latvian School because everything was already
 
known what needs to be known. Back then classes in Latvian School were
 
small although the number of young people in the community was rather
 
large. Emphasis was placed on learning English and getting an education.
 
And for the maintenance of Ttvjan society, the youth was encouraged
 
to participate in cultural events such as girl scouts, dances, and
 
choirs. Thus for some, Latvian School was a non-reality with many
 
Latvian children growing up not knowing facts about such subjects as
 
Latvian history or geography. These same people would in later years
 
make up the pool of potential teachers for Oskars Kalpaks.22 Ilga
 
Strazdii;g bemoans the situation that she feels has contributed to a
 
lack of interest among the students for Latvian School, namely, an
 
overly conservative approach to teaching in both methods and curriculum
 
materials: "If there had been that kind of curriculum /compared to
 
today/ in the 1950's, if, also, the parents had pushed a lot of us--
my age group and others--I think there would have been a totally
 
different approach in teaching, learning, liking and retention of
 
the language and everything else. There was a total gap f
or about
 
10 to 15 years /from the time of the exiles' arrival and ALA's refor-
mation of the curriculum/. I was bored to tears if somebody mentioned
 
Latvian School. I would cringe. I hated it simply because I felt that
 
most of the people teaching were 110 years of age and thought we
 
were in l
5 in a country school in Latvia." Ilga continues: "It was
 
an unpleasant situation. You had to perform rather than learn. And so,
 
the curriculum has changed wonderfully, but mean while what happened
 
was that there was a gap there between those who came later--already

more of a continuum--of curriculum, a reasonably good worked out
 
curriculum--the school would have been different." 23
 
Ilga's concern
 
for her culture and community is translated into positive action as
 
a teacher. She has introduced folkloric materials into  her classes
 
such as word games that are old and traditbnal. She has made her
 
youngsters act out Latvian folktales. And she has brought in amber
 
jewelry and a kokle2
 to show the students. Ilga has also translated
 
chidren's books from English into Latvian. There are too few colorful
 
children's books in Latvian up to the fourth grade, although some are
 
published in Sweden but they are very expensive. The books that Ilga
 
chooses to translate have many colorful pictures and very few words.
 
So far she has done about a dozen books. 
25  Regularly Ilga creates hand-
outs for the children using simple words along with drawings. She
 
estimates that throughout the years as a teacher she has put together
 
about 500 handouts. 
26
 
S
 
Teachers at Oskars Kalpaks
  
The first teachers at Oskars Kalpaks were professionals from Latvia.
 
Today many of the old professionals have retired but replacing them
 
has become a problem. Latvians place great emphasis and value on
 
education. Yet the ones who do get educated tend to leave the community--
it is a built-in dispersal mechanism that diminishes the Latvian
 
community in terms of population and in terms of profession a
l quality.
 
Many of the young people have gone away to school or in search of
 
better jobs. This reduces the pool of educated Latvians remaining in
 
the community. There are no teachers in their twenties and only a
 
F
i
.82: Ri ardas Vjdutis
 15
 
few in their thirties. There are two teenagers at the school and they
 
help their parents (Mrs.
 o ka1ns and Mrs. KrÃ¼mi
). With the disperse-
r
nent of the younger educated members of the community, availability
 
for teaching has become more important than certification. Use of
 
teachers who have not graduated from Latvian high school, or even
 
grade school, is becoming increasingly common throughout the Latvian
 
community in North America. Yet there is some concern 
27  that the
 
administration may have doubts as to the capability of people in
 
their twenties to be good teachers. And some are discouraged from
 
becoming teachers because they "didn 't have  a Latvian
 education."
 28
 
Parental Input
  
A loose PTA organization (Padoms) exists which elects a school
 
board to supervise the education of the school. 29 At the beginning
 
of each year each class has an elected parent representative.
 
Together they form a parents council which assists the principal
 
and teachers with resource materials, preparations and the running
 
of certain school programs such as food and activities for the
 
yearly graduation ceremonies.

0 But the curriculum is set. There is
 
very little the parents can do if they want their children later
 
to a
i
nd Latvian summer high school. They have to accept what is t r
 
and have very little choice about the subjects being taught. But th
 
do have a choice about the following: how the school is run, how
 
the teachers are compensated, how the school is remodeled, and every
 
Saturday a parent is at the school as a monitor making sure the
 
lights are turned off after c
lasses have ended and that the black-
boards are clean.3'

Latvian School and American School
  
In Latvian School students learn more and experience earlier much
 
more discipline. They also do more rote memorization. The academic
 
discipline in Latvian School seems to make the youngsters better
 
studeits in American School where they generally do better in all
 
subjects, especially in languages. 32 It is hoped by many Latvian
 
teachers that their efforts in the ethnic school will have an input
 
on American schools by making them aware of Latvia and its culture.
 
Ideally, students should get credit for going to ethnic school and
 
studying subjects not taught in American schools. Such accredidation
 
may also make a difference in the attitudes of the Latvian students
 
towards attending ethnic school and in maintaining pride in their
 
cultural background. At a time when many American school systems find
 
themselves economically strapped, accredidation for attending ethnic
-
school may help ease the economic situation. 33  Even though the ethnic
 
school would like to enter the public arena for purposes of accredi-
dation,  federal funding of ethnic schools is not incourages. It is
 
belie1ed chat any susidization brings with it attaches strings.
 thnic
 
schools can maintain their own integrity only if it comes from the
 
community. Federal funding seems to create more problems than i

Financial Commitment of 
-
 
It is not cheap being a Latvian. Special efforts have to be made
 
to attend cultural events to expose children to Latvian culture
 
outside the home and this may require travel to other cities. "It's
 
a ca mitment, not a burden," says Ilga Strazdi
. It's a financial
 
commitment which does not stop with the $100 tuition fee. Every social
 
o
ccasion at the s
chool requires expenditures for costumes, food, gasoline,
 
and f
lowers or gifts for the teachers. 35

their Latvian identity they wanted to improve their knowledge of i
t
 
by going to summer camps like the one at Garezers. And when they
 
became older, they wanted to marry Latvians and send their children
 
to Latvian Saturday School. 37
 
Summer Camrs and T
-a:vian High School
  
There are three summer high school camps for Latvians in the
 
United States: Kursa in Seattle, Garezers in Three Rivers, Michigan,
 
and Bever T
ha in Quakertown, Pennsylvania. Of the three, Garezers is
 
the largest and the most popular. The first high school class at
 
Garezers was taught in 1
968-69 with 15 students. Today there are
 
over 200 students who attend during the summer. Classes at Garezers
 
run for four consecutive summers. Each summer course lasts for six
 
weeks, six days per week. The subjects taught there are political
 
history, history, art history, geography, and literature. There is
 
also an extensive sports program, and a traditional arts and crafts
 
program which includes weaving, silversmithing, leather working,
 
i

wood working, and paint in

Language Retention
  
'
-he questio?i of w1r
i
ether language is important in
,maintaining
 
community and personal identity is answered in a number of ways:
 
for some, '
Language is the ultimate marker, for others it is just Dne
 
component of many that go into defining a Latvian. Janis Tupesis
 
believes that language is extremely critical but that it is not the
 
most important thing. For him the practice of traditions will prolong
 
the life of the community.
 4
0 Ilga Strazdii;L thinks that a person is
 
no longer a Latvian if he or she simply know the language but does
 
not know the cultural connotations that go with it. She searches for
 
an emotional identity that comes from intimate knowledge of rules
 
and regulations for her so3iety.
 41  Rev. Janis 1
ï¿½in5ns believes that
 
although language is a vital strong point in maintaining identity,
 
i
t is absolutely essential to be religious first. For him i
t is
 
possible to be a Latvian-Lutheran and not know the language. He also
 
reasons that- Latvian culture is not dying but just existing under
 
differing conditions and consisting of different traits.
 42  And
 
Walters Noliendorfs and Valdis Zeps think that language is the greatest
 
touchstone in the community. But they believe that Latvi
-ans are less
 
susceptible than others in the area of language retnetion which the
 
Latvians feel as a strong obligation to retain. They also believe that
 
loss of language can be overcome provided it is practiced somewhere
 
where i
t can be learned, for example, under conditions where nationality

is part u
 culture such as the home where language is part of the family.
 
The problem of the potential of language loss is not overlooked,
 
although, at times, there is little that can be done to lessen language
 
inarticulatioi. Part of the problem appears in the Latvian School. By
 
its very nature the ethnic school has to teach those subjects not
 
taught in American s
chools, but to teach other non-Latvian subjects
 
would be redundant in viei of time limitations. The absence of such
 
subjects as math or science in the ethnic school avoids development
 
and use of everyday or special terms. The problem is similar in Latvia
 
today where Russian is substituted for Latvian in specialized areas.
 
This leads to an inarticulation in certain areas of everyday life
 
when a switch is made to English. The exile often finds that the
 
et hnic language he uses is not always supported by a cultural context.
 
Under such conditicus certain areas of _ alL g u a g e  atrophy, for example:
 
technologies, bureaucratic language, telephone, television, and slang.
 
Some look towards the et h
nic school to help remedy the problem
 
of language atrophy. B--
i
t they find 1
:-stead what they believe to be
 
a school system chat sno:
-tc a conservative pull towards learning
 
grammar rather :hcc language. Tao ouch time is spert learning  punctu-
ation and rate memorization of f
lames and dates, and orthographr.
 
Some feel that che greatest problem lies in conceptual and methodo-
logical approaches to language teaching. It is o f t e n  assumed that te
 
student knows the language and needs only to improve his knowledge
 
of the grammar. In actual fact, they say, the approach should teach
 
both at the s a n e  tine: grammar together with the language. The
 
problems are not always solved in thetextbooks used today.

 Mr. Krumi;  mentions that in order to be Latvian you have
 
to have a Latvian orientation,  tha: is, knowledge of the language,
 
the history, and the culture. Wanting independence for Latvia is also
 
important. And teaching the children the cultural values of their
 
forebearers is also important. 49 Today's Latvian has to learn to
 
cope with the world as a whole, especially if the world wide community
 
of exile Latvians is to maintain cohesion. A "Global Latvian" is
 
developing because of the many far flung networks among the Latvians
 
scattered across the world. These networks include saturday schools,
 
summer camps, universities, and conferences in one country or another.
 
This can keep a culture alive and it may be going back some day to
 
reestablish ties. The only hope now seems to be for the Global Latvian
 
who is capable of functioning anywhere--an equivalent to the

Europe, Latvia has experienced the onslaught of foreign armies 41
 
hundreds of years. In 1
795 Latvia was absorbed by Imperial Russia and
 
held for over a century. When the Russian Empire collapsed during World
 
War I many nations of Eastern Europe gained independence. An
 
independent and democratic republic of Latvia was proclaimed on
 
November 1
8,  1918. By 1920 a peace treaty was signed with the Soviet
 
Union, which renounced forever any territorial claims to Latvian soil.
 
But independence lasted only twenty years.  In June 1940 Latvia was once
 
again invaded by Russian troops following the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact,
 
which carved out spheres of influence between Nazi Germany and the
 
Soviet Union.
 
The first Latvians arrived in North America in 1
638 and s
ettled
 
on the Delaware Bay. By the end of the first two decades of the 20th
 
century the number of Latvians in the United States had increased to
 
about 30,000. Between 1
918 and 1940, when Latvia was an independent
 
nation, only 666 Latvians emigrated to this country; but once World War
 
II arrived and independence was lost, some 200,000 Latvians were
 
displaced from their land. These people were exiles who chose not to
 
2
 
return t
o Latvia, which was under Russian occupation. Of the 200,000
 
who fled their land, the largest group eventually settled in the United
 
States, while others formed exile communities in Australia, Canada,
 
England, Sweden, Germany, Venezuela, and elsewhere. Of the Latvians who
 
came to the United States, about 3
,000 settled in the Milwaukee area.\ /
 
The oldest Lativan community in the United States was founded
 
around 1
900 in Irma, Wisconsin, about 1
50 miles to the north of
 
Milwaukee. Following World War II a couple of very active Latvian
 
families assisted their
 brothers and sisters to come to
 
Milwaukee. One such family, the Kazaks, brought four to five hundred
 
Latvians to the city following their initial work contracts in
 
Mississippi. Prior to their arrival their was no Latvian community in
 
Milwaukee; today the city has the largest concentartion of Lativans in
 
Wisconsin. The Milwaukee Latvian colony acts as a cultural center for
 
other small, outlying Lativan communities in Waukesha, Minominee
 
Falls, Shorewood, Fond du Lac, and the farming area of La Crosse.
 
Between 1
956 and 1
968 the Latvian community in Milwaukee numbered
 
3
,000. Today that number has dropped to somewhere between 600 and
 
1
,000. The growth of the Latvian community in Milwaukee since the 1
950s
 
has not resulted in ghetto dusters of Latvians.  Instead,  the
 
settlement patterns are diffuse throughout the city and its surrounding
 
3
 
areas. The scattered nature of the Latvian settlement can be explained
 
by the kind of people the exiles were âa highly educated, elite, upper
 
class who could function in any capacity in American Society.
 
The events of World War II and the terror of Sovietization during
 
and following the war reduced the Lativan population by about
 
twenty-five percent. Those who fled their homeland carry with them the
 
knowledge that Lativan culture is in a fragile and waning state. They
 
fear that the Soviet policies of Russification of their homeland will
 
eventually lead to the ethnicide of their culture. Most Latvian exiles
 
know that the extinction of their culture is a direct possibility. I
t
 
is this knowledge and fear that shapes the philosophical content of the
 
emigre school system, and i
t is the same fear that contributes t
o the
 
dialogue betweem different Latvian generations concerning the
 
maintenance of ethnic culture in exile.
 
The Latvian exile community's concern for maintaining their
 
cultural heritage had its origins in Displaced Persons (DP) Camps
 
tnroughout Western Europe which sprang up immediately following World
 
War II. Seventy-five percent of the Latvians who fled
 
communist-occupied Latvia ended up in the occupied sectors of Germany.
 
Most Latvians believed that they would eventually return to  their
 
homeland; but in the meantime life had to go on in tne DP coup .
 
culture had to continue, especially the education of the children woo
 
one day would be returning. The school system established in the camps
 
was a logical extension of the refugees'  continued interest in their
 
homeland. By 1945 there were 294 DP camps registering 82,000 Latvians
 
r
i
 
in the taree occupied sectors of western Germany.
v By 1946-1947  i
l,200
 
students were attending 224 schools in the camps;  they were  taught by
 
The curriculum in the schools reflected the
 
educational system in preâwar Latvia. Most of the schools  in Ger-many
 
had closed down by 1950 because of the final relocation of Latvian
 
exiles  to host  countries  such as the United States.
 
History of the Oskars Kalpaks Latvian Saturday School
 
The nowâ defunct Wisconsin Latvian Association sponsored  the
 
establishment of a Latvian school system in January 1951.  Often held in
 
rented churches and private homes,  the Latvian school changed location
 
about nine times in its first few years.  In 1962 the school moved to
 
its present location at St.  John's Evangelical Lutheran Latvian Church
 
in Wauwatosa. The church complex,  orginaily owned  by German Baptists,
 
is  the oldest  church in Wauwatosa, which is  adjacent  to Milwaukee.
 
The  building structure  is made up of a church section and a back
 
section assigned  to classrooms.  The school portion of the building
 
complex consists of five classrooms upstairs,  two on the main floor,
 
and two in the basement;  each grade,  beginning with the kindergarten
 
class, has its own room. The basement area and the seventh graue  room
 
on the main floor are also used for dance practice and  singing.
 
R
 
Adjacent  to the seventh grade room is the kindergarten play area. Here
 
children can sit at  tables as they work or lounge on the floor as they
 
play.  The classrooms upstairs are all small, with about five or six
 
students  in each grade.  The upstairs also houses the school library
 
which has a small selection of books in Latvian available for loan to
 
the students.  There are seventeen teachers,  including substitutes,
 
teaching approximately forty-five pupils.
 
The establishment of Latvian school in Milwaukee coincides
 
approximately with the beginning of Amerikas Latviesu Apvieniba,
 
the American Latvian Association (ALA).  Founded in 1951,  the ALA's
 
membership is open to organizations as well as individuals. By 1969
 
forty percent of all Latvian organizations belonged to the ALA.
 
The purpose of the ALA is  to superintend all Latvian schools,
 
design and publish curriculum guides,  call teachers'  conferences,
 
conduct standardized exams, and establish overall program grozils.  All
 
of  these activities are accomplished without any financial  support  froin
 
outside the Latvian community-ï¿½/
 
The first  curriculum guide for Latvian schoois was prepared in
 
1951. A new guide was published in 1969 with the help of the Canadiï¿½-,:
.
 
Latvian Association.
VAll Latvian schools try to follow the guideli -,
,
,-
of  the ALA.  The guidelines prepare students for entr

 C
,
 
6
 
School programs,  such as the one in Garezers at Three Rivers, Michigan.
 
Fiaii
l exams are closely patterned on standardized exam guidelines
 
administered by the educational s
ection of the ALA.
 
School Administration
 
Eriks Kr min ,  the school principal, is the only administrator a
t
 
Oskars Kalpaks.
 
All Latvian schools in the United States are independent and
 
locally supported. Tuition at Oskars Kalpaks is charged per
 
family--the tuition of $
100 permits any number of students from the
 
same family to attend school. The money collected from tuition goes for
 
classroom improvements, educational materials, reimbursement t
o
 
teachers for out-of-pocket expenses, such as gas, educational supplies
 
(
slide projectors, phonographs, copy machines), and development of the
 
school library.
 
Some  parents  have  questions  concerning  community input  into  the
 
decision-making process at Oskars Kalpaks. It is not always clear to
 
them who runs the school and who determines the rules. The :
 
while on the surface the school is run by a director, thert
 
enough parental input when decisions are made about the running of the
 
school. At best,  they feel, the input i
s only indirect.
 
Classes and Curriculum
 
Oskars Kalpaks is a selective school--it does not admit all the
 
children who would like to attend. Enrollment is based on a nominal
 
entrance exam given to those who want to enter, starting with s
tudents
 
entering  kindergarten. Students have to be six years old to attend the
 
first grade, although some older s
tudents may attend lower aged c
lasses
 
according to ability. Most students start the school at the lowest
 
level. There are many older Latvian children who do not attend the
 
school, but attempts to involve additional students at up ,

not encouraged. "Kalpaks seems battened down against later
 
because the non-attending students have not kept up a level of langu
 
usage or knowledge of other subjects, yet no alternative is provided,"
 
explains Valdis Zeps, -
-
-
-
-
 Students who are slow learners or who
 
flunk are passed from grade to grade without certification for passing,
 
only for attending.
 
Subject orientation determines the structure of the school.
 
Classes are arranged according to the subject matter and the system
 
itself is loosely based on the one in Latvia during i
ts years of
 
independence. Subjects taught at the Lativian school are based
 
exclusively on Lativan culture. They include Latvian language and
 
grammar, literature, history, geography, folksongs, and folk dancing. A
 
class in religion is also included, primarily stemming from the
 
Lutheranism. The subjects taught in the school are ones that students
 
will not get in American school.
 
8
 
Classes begin on Saturday morning at 9
:35 A
.M. and end at  1
:50
 
P
.M. The first period lasts forty minutes and the remaining five
 
periods last thirty-five minutes. Nine classes are taught during ecah
 
period, including kindergarten and first through eighth grades.
 
During i
ts early years the school used materials and books from
 
Latvia and the DP camps. Many of the books were published in Germany
 
after the war. By the early 1
950s some tests were being printed in the
 
United States. According to Principal KrT
hnin', the ALA is the largest
 
free world publisher of educational materials for the 200,000 Latvians
 
in North America. The ALA works together with their Canadian
 
counterparts to produce most of the textbooks used in North America.
 
Sometimes a school may be conclude that portions of the suggested
 
curriculum are inapporpriate, over the students' heads, or in incorrect
 
sequence. In those cases the teachers can decide not to follow the
 
recommendations of the ALA. Teachers chose the books during a
 
semi-monthly teachers' meeting; the meetings also provide an
 
opportunity to discuss text availability, the general course of
 
instruction, and the progress of the students. Curriculum materials are

.signated grade levles, some teachers chose not to use them and
 
ovide their own materials. According to a number of teachers, there
 
9
 
example, texts on Latvian agriculture are too difficult for toe
 
students. The ALA's assumption is that students know the language and
 
can start reading any text, but that assumption may be too optimistic
 
in some cases.
 
Some former students of Oskars Kalpaks remember the early days of
 
the Latvian school in Milwaukee with some bitterness. Ilga Strazdiri ,
 
who today teaches the kindergarten c
lass at Oskars Kalpaks, remembers
 
those early days:
 
i
t was terrible. The curriculum was simply read and
 
answer questions and memorize; memorize and recite from
 
poems and proverbs. That was the kind of curriculum we
 
dealt with in the 1950s.  .  .
 .  What was important then,
 
in the curriculum, was strictly Latvian, Latvian,
 
Latvian âyou spoke Latvian, you thought Latvian, you
 
read Latvian. Most of them [
the books] were t
err
Iv
 
dull and complex to somebody that age. I
 
death of Latvian school. I
 
The ALA began to realize that the students who arrived at the summer
 
high school at Garezers were unequally prepared. Even though everyone
 
should have had equal preparation at the local schools, the actual
 
levels of competence varied greatly. By the end of the 1
960s the ALA
 
had reformulated the curriculum so that every local Latvian school
 
would be able to follow the same one.
 
Some of the school's problems in the early years stemmed from the
 
background of the Latvians who arrived in Milwaukee. Many of the
 
Latvian children who were potential students of the school spent their
 
1
0
 
formative years in Latvia or Germany. When they arrived in North
 
America they were between eight and fifteen years old and already
 
spoke Latvian. Parents assumed that there was no need for them to
 
attend Latvian school because they knew everything they needed to know.
 
During the 1950s classes were small in the Latvian school, although the
 
numnber of young people in the community was rather large. Emphasis was
 
placed on learning English and getting an education. As for the
 
maintenance of Latvian society, the youth was encouraged to
 
participate in social and cultural activities, such as Girl Scouts,
 
dances, and choirs. Thus, many Latvian children grew up not knowing
 
facts about such subjects as Latvian history or geography.
 
Igla Strazdin , one of the school teachers, bemoans another
 
situation that she feels has contributed to a lack of interest in the
 
Latvian school among students--the overly conservative approach to
 
teaching reflected in both the teaching methods and curriculum
 
materials.
 
If there had been that Kind of curriculum [
compared to
 
today]  in the 1950s. If, also, the parents had pusned a
 
lot of us--my age group and others âI think there would
 
have been a totally different approach in teaching,
 
learning, liking, and retention of the language and
 
everything else. There was a total gap for about ten to
 
fifteen years  [
from the time of the exiles' arrival to
 
the ALA's reformation of the curriculum]. I was bored
 
to tears.  If somebody mentioned Latvian school, I would
 
cringe. I hated i
t simply because I felt that most of
 
the people teaching were 1
10 years of age and thought
 
we were in 1905 in a country school in Latvia. . . . .
 
was an unpleasant situation. You had to perform rather
 
than learn. And so,  the curriculum has changed
 
wonderfully. But meanwhile, what happened was that
 
there was a gap there between those who came
 
later--already they were loosing some of the Latvian
 
language.  If there had been more of a continuum, of
 
1
1
 
curriculum--a reasonably good, worked out
 
curriculum âthe school would have been different.
 
(ES82 - RV-c37,  Side 1
,  190)
 
Ilga's concern for her culture and community is translated into
 
positive action as a teacher. She has introduced folkloric materials,
 
such as traditional word games, into her classes. She has had her class
 
act out Latvian folktales and has taken in amber jewelry and a kokie. 
In addition,  she has translated children's books from  English into
 
Latvian. There are too few colorful children's books in Latvian up to
 
the fourth grade; a few are published in Sweden,  but they are very
 
expensive. The books that Ilga chooses to translate aave many coio
 
pictures and very few words.  So far she has cor
 
books. Ilga regularly creates handouts for the
 
words along with drawings.  She estimates that throughout her years as a
 
teacher she has put together about five hundred handouts.
 
The question of whether language is important in maintaining
 
community and personal identity can be answered in a number of ways.
 
For some language is the ultimate marker;  for others it is just one
 
component of many that go into defining a Latvian. Janis
 
Tupesis,
 ,
 feels that language is extremely critical, but that it
 
is not tne most  important thing. In his view the practice of traditions
 
will prolong the life of the community.
 
M 
Ilga Strazdin
 ) s
"
' thinks  that a person is no longer a Latvian if h
 
or she simply knows the language, but does not know the cultural
 
connotations that go with it.  She searches for an emotional identity
 
that comes f rom intimate knowledge of the rules and regulations of h
 
society. 
I 
Rev.  J57nis Kinihs,
 
, believes that although language is
 
vital in maintaining identity,  it is absolutely essential to be
 
religious first.  In his view it is possible to be a Latvian-Lutheran
 
and not to know the language. He also reasons that Latvian culture i
 
not dying, but just existing under differing conditions and consistil
l
 
of different traits. 
I 
The problem of potential lanugage loss is not overlooked by the
 
Latvian community,  although,  at times there is little that can be done
 
to lessen language inarticulateness. Part of the problem appears in the
 
Latvian school.  By its very nature the ethnic school has  to teach those
 
subjects not  taught  in American schools;  to teach other non - Latvian
 
subjects would be redundant in view of time limitations.  The absence in
 
the school curriculum of such subjects as math or science inhibits the
 
development and use of everyday or special  terms.
 
There is a similar problem in Latvia today, where Russian i
s
 
substituted for Latvian in specialized areas.  This leads  to an
 
inarticulateness in certain areas of everyday life, when a sw_
ï¿½''.
 
made into English.  The immigrant often finds that the ethnic language
 
1
3
 
he uses is not always supported by cultural context. Under such
 
conditions certain areas of language atrophy, for example,
 
technological terms, bureaucratic language, and slang.
 
Some look toward the ethnic school to help remedy the problem of
 
language atrophy. They find instead what they believe to be a school
 
system that shows a conservative pull toward learning grammar rather
 
than language, with too much time spent learning punctuation,
 
memorizing names and dates, and practicing orthography. Some feel that
 
the greatest problem lies in conceptual and methodological appraoches
 
to language teaching. It is often assumed that the student knows the
 
language and needs only to improve his knowledge of grammar. In actual
 
fact, they say, the approach should teach both at the same
 
time--grammar together with the language.
 
Teachers
 
The first teachers at Oskars Kalpaks were professionals from
 
Latvia. Today many of the old professionals have retired and replacing
 
them has become a problem. Latvians place great emphasis and value on
 
education. Yet the ones who are educated tend to leave the community--a
 
built-in dispersal mechanism that diminishes the Latvian community in
 
terms of population and in terms of professional quality. Many of the
 
young people have gone away to school or in search of better jobs,
 
reducing the pool of educated Latvians remaining in the community.
 
There are no teachers in their twenties and only a f
ew in their
 
1
4
 
thirties. There are two t
eenagers at the school who help their parents,
 
Mrs. Ro
alns and Mrs. Krtiinin . With the dispersion of the younger,
 
educated members of the connumity, availability for teaching has become
 
more important than certification. Use of teachers who have not
 
graduated from Latvian high school, or even grade school, is becoming
 
increasingly commong throughout the Latvian community in North America.
 
Yet there is some concern that the administration may have doubts about
 
the capability of people in their twenties to be good teachers. Some
 
young people are discouraged from becoming teachers because they do not
 
have a Latvian education.
 
Parents
 
A loosely organized Parent Teacher Association (
PTA), or Padoms,
 
exists which elects a school board to supervise the education a
t the
 
school. At the beginning of each year each class elects a parent
 
representative. Together they form a parents council which assists the
 
principal and teachers in locating resource materials and preparing and
 
running certain school programs, such as the yearly graduation
 
ceremonies. But the curriculum is set. There is very little t
he parents
 
can do in terms of curriculum, if they want  their cnildren t
o b
e able
 
to attend Latvian summer high school. Parents have t
o a
ccept wtiot  is
 
offered and have very little choice about the subjects being taught.
 
They do have a choice about how the school is run, how the teachers
 
compensated ,
 and how the school i
s remodeled, however.  In addition,
 
1
5
 
every Saturday a parent attends the school as a monitor, making sure
 
the lights are turned off after classes have ended and that the
 
blackboards are clean.
 
Meetings of the Parent Teacher Association (
PTA) determine how
 
each student is doing and problems are brought to the attention of the
 
parents. Some students who have fallen behind or have flunked are
 
assigned summer work as remedial or compensation work, or may repeat
 
the year.  Parents have to take responsibility for their child's
 
progress. In accordance with an old Latvian tradition, an assignment
 
booklet is signed every weekend by the parents who act as their
 
children's monitors.
 
Students
 
During the fieldwork the eighth grade graduating c
lass was
 
interviewed for comments on their experiences a
s s
tudents during nine
 
years of Saturday classes. All said that their parents made them atte
 
the school and that,  although they had certain reservations about the
 
school and its teaching methods, they were all in agreement that the
 
whole experience was worth i
t. Latvian school seems to have helped
 
deepen their commitment to being Latvian and caring about the country
 
from which their parents came. They thought that the subjects they
 
studied were important and relevant to Latvia and to what their
 
relatives lived through during and following World War I
I.
 
0 
Surprisingly,  a number of students thought  that the discipline
 
they encountered at Oskars Kalpaks was good for them,  and they felt  it
 
made them better students in American school. The students also felt
 
they knew more facts  than Americans,  in addition to the knowledge of a
 
foreign language. Being a "foreigner" was not a stigma anymore because
 
Americans "look up to you,  not down on You, .
. commented  
 
(ES82-RV-C17,  Side  1
,  090).
 
Although they speak a second language,  students do not always use
 
it when away from the supervision of parents and teachers. Which
 
language is spoken âEnglish or Latvian -- depends on where they are and
 
what  they are talking about. The students use Latvian when they do not
 
want people to know that they are being talked about. They equate
 
knowledge of Latvian with maintenance of their heritage.  They think
 
that  speaking Latvian makes a person Latvian. To foster their Latvian
 
identity they want  to improve their knowledge of it by going to summer
 
camps. When they become older,  they want to marry Latvians and send
 
their children  to a Latvian Saturday school.
 
Summer Camps and Latvian High School
 
There are three summer high school  camps  for Latvians  in tne
 
United States:  Kursa in Seattle, Garezers in Three Rivers, Michigan,
 
and Beverrna in Quakertown,  Pennsylvania.  Of the three, Garezers is  the
 
largest and most  Popular. The first high school class at Garezers was
 
t
 
taught  in  1968-1969

students who attend during the summer. Classes at Garezers run for four
 
consecutive sumemrs. Each summer course lasts for six weeks, six days
 
per week. The subjects taught include political history, history, art
 
history, geography, and literature. There is also an extensive sports
 
program and a traditional arts and crafts program, which includes
 
weaving, silversmithing, leather working, woodworking, and painting.
 
Concentration on cultural activities makes i
t impossible to
 
isolate the students from total immersion in Latvian culture at
 
Garezers. Nevertheless, not everyone i
s happy with the situation ther ,
 
Comments are often heard about the incompetence of administrators and
 
teachers, intolerance of dissent, last-minute scheduling of teacher ,
 
old staff that is retained basically for being orthodox in educational
 
and disciplinary matters, and a principal who does not have pedagogical
 
credentials. Some misgivings are also expressed that Garezers is not
 
being used as a teacher-training ground, inspite of the fact that i
t i
s
 
so close to Western Michigan University, which has a teacher-training
 
program for Latvian teachers.
 
Generational Conflicts in the Milwaukee-area Latvian Community
 
Latvians in their thirties and forties feel s
trongly that
 
opportunities to express dissenting opinions in the Latvian community
 
are minimal. There is a staunch conservatism among the older
 
generation, which leads them to feel that the World War II exile i
s the
 
sole bearer of Latvian culture. The younger generation feels that their

Conclusions
 
Today's Latvians are p
roud o
f t
ru er ethnicity and Americans are
 
said t
o b
e jealous, a
t least according to some of the students I talked
 
: ides toward ethnicity have changed through the years,
 
H
r1
ri
 due to the Black Movement of the 1960s and 1970s. Today many
 
lieve that the most important thing is to have an ethnic cultural
 
:kground and a strong historical sense of belonging. It is the
 
ctice of traditions, they believe, that will prolong the life of the
 
y
. Mr. KrT
hnin' mentions that in order to be Latvian you
 
3
 
atvian orientation, that is, knowledge of the language,
 
history, and the culture. Wanting independence for Latvia is also
 
ortant. Teaching the children the cultural values of their
 
forebearers i
s imporant as well.
 
Today's Latvian has to learn to cope with the world as a whole,
 
especially if the worldwide community of exiled Latvians is to maintain
 
cohesion. A "global Latvian" is devleoping because of the many
 
far-flung networks among the Latvians scattered throughout the world.
 
These networks include Saturday schools, summer camps, universities,
 
and conferences in one country or another, and may well keep the
 
Latvian culture alive.

The greatest amount o
f credit for this report on the Oskars
 
Kalpaks Latvian Saturday School in Wauwatosa goes to the very people i

concerns--the Milwaukee-area Latvian community. Their graciousness,
 
hospitality, and full-hearted support for the Ethnic Heritage and
 
Lanugage Schools Project made all the difference in the world t

final outcome. As for myself, I benefited from the experience more
 
than I had hoped. For awhile I was part of a community of very warm and
 
generous people, and I was happy to be their school's chronicler for a
 
few short but exciting weeks. Even more so, as a Lithuanian, I was
 
proud t
o be able to work with people from my brother nation (bralu
  
tauta). 
Of all the people I met in the Latvian community, one deserves
 
special mention âIlga Strazdin . She was one of the very first Latvians
 
I met in Milwaukee. I
t was her enthusiasm for the project and her love
 
for ner culture and country that inspired me to undertake the study.
 
She also paved the way and opened many doors during my fieldwork.
 
Without Ilga's boundless energy as she guided me through her community
 
the study would not have recorded as much as it did. She is the kind o
f
 
person whose concern for all people i
s infectious and inspiring.  I
 
spent many hours listening to Ilga as she unfolded the joy and p
ain in
 
her heart, of be in. o
