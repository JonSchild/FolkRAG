Summary of Interview: Nathan Tapio knew he wanted to be a nurse, so he began working as a 
CNA when he was 17. He notes that at the time, there were often waiting lists for nursing 
schools. He describes his first job after becoming an RN; he worked on in surgery at a hospital, 
including on the neurosurgical unit. He talks about going back to school to become a Nurse 
Practitioner (NP). He currently works in a correctional facility where he sees many psychiatric 
conditions. He notes he has better work/life balance as an NP. He sees nursing as a very 
rewarding and marketable field.

Introductions

Born in New London, Wisconsin, a small of town of about 6,000 in northeast 
Wisconsin, between Appleton and the Green Bay area. Only child. In high school, 
was more interested architecture. Aunt a nurse and nursing professor. In looking 
at career options, this was inspiring—“the ability to help people and have a career 
path that is very veritable and very marketable.” Started at 17 as a nursing 
assistant “just to get my feet wet” as a CNA—a nursing assistant—at a nursing 
home facility. 
0.02.09 
On this first job: “It was kind of an entry point into the field … It was helpful, you 
got paid a little bit more money. It was more weekend work, maybe weeknights 
here and there … But I don’t know that it was that different than any other 
position, you know? It was what it was.” 
0.02.59 
On what liked about this job: “I mean, I liked to help people. And especially in a 
nursing facility. It’s just—it’s hard work but it’s very rewarding. Many times, the 
patients and residents are just at the end of life. Or they’re there and they suffer 
from advanced dementia or Alzheimer’s. Their families may not come very often, 
or they may not remember many of their families. And it’s just nice to be able to 
help those people. You know, it’s a caring, helping profession. So that’s just a 
very rewarding position.” 
0.03.56 
Graduated high school in 2004. After that, worked as CNA for four years at the 
same nursing home. Changed position to CNA at a hospital; at the same time was 
going to school for nursing, in a two-year Associate’s degree at Fox Valley 
Technical College in Appleton, WI. 
0.04.56 
At that time, there was a waiting list for the nursing program. Did core 
coursework at this time while working and taking gen ed classes. The core 
nursing a combination of classes and clinicals in different sites, including 
psych/mental health. At that time, waiting lists were standard, but a lot more 
nursing programs now, so suspects this less of an issue—although there is a high 
demand for nurses still.

0.06.14 
Clinicals took place at nursing homes, in-patient hospital units, in-patient mental 
health. Mostly in the Oshkosh area. 
0.06.49 
On clinicals: “I did enjoy the psych/mental health clinical, the hospital settings 
and the psych/mental health. At the end there was a prolonged one-on-one clinical 
with a nurse in an ICU. That was interesting, but something that I wasn’t really 
drawn to. Most of the time the patients were intubated and sedated, and there 
wasn’t really a lot of interaction with the patient.” 
0.07.56 
On mentoring while training: “I don’t remember their names specifically, but 
there were some good instructors. Especially the clinical instructors, you just a 
felt bit more close to, because it was more intimate … And many times, you 
stayed with the same group during rotations, so you kind of bonded a little bit 
more with that group or those instructors. Those instructors were generally in the 
field as nurse practitioners, so they generally had a little bit more real-world 
knowledge as opposed to more of the theory of nursing side. So overall I would 
say more the clinical instructors.” 
0.09.21 
Most students at the Tech College had already had some experience—and were 
already nurse assistants and working. Some were adult students going back to 
school. Others were single moms—“I don’t envy them—I don’t know how they 
did it.” A variety of interests and backgrounds. A program requirement was to 
have a nursing assistant certification. 
0.10.42 
Each clinical was about 8-10 people. 
0.10.55 
After graduation with Associate’s degree, was still working at a hospital in 
neurosurgical floor was trauma patients, post-operative and in-patient. Did that for 
two years—this was the same unit had worked on as nursing assistant, so 
transitioned from one role to another. Then after taking a semester off, went back 
to school for bachelor’s degree at Marian College in Fond du Lac, doing a night-
time program. 
0.12.13 
On the transition from CNA to RN: “I’ve always said this, and it depends on your 
background, but I don’t think there should really be a hierarchy among nurses. 
And as a group, I think we have a tendency to ‘eat our young’, so to speak. And 
some nurses are more prone to delegate or to micromanage their nursing assistants 
or their licensed practical nurses. Assistants that worked below a registered nurse. 
And I think having the experience as a nursing assistant, you know that, you 
know, you can do everything that the nursing assistant can do. And it’s not out of 
your purview. When you talk about bathing or turning a patient, you’re still 
responsible for those things. I always thought it wasn’t above me to do those 
things, because I had been there. But I think it wasn’t as abrupt a change—I 
worked nights as an assistant and then days. So, the whole workload was a bit 
different. There was a whole orientation on the unit, but I was familiar with them. 
I had a rapport with some of those nurses … But it’s one of those things you learn 
best by doing. But I think it’s important to know if you’re managing or delegating 
to someone, it’s important to know those roles and what they do. But it just took 
time and shift change and getting oriented to the role and job was very helpful.” 
0.14.54 
On a typical day: “Oh, it’s busy—many times, you don’t sit down the whole shift. 
I can’t speak to it now. But you’re kind of the core of patient care. Usually, you 
get on the unit, get report, speak with the nurse you’re taking over for. 
Page 3 of 7 
 
Depending—if you’re coming in on the day shift, you might look at the lab work, 
see if there’s anything you need to call your provider about … And then you’re 
starting your rounds, seeing your patients, giving some medications, starting some 
IVs, and then you maybe finish your morning rounds, and kind of document 
things, and do all your charting. That’s probably around breakfast time, so if 
there’s medicines or anything like that, you’re doing that stuff. During the day, 
you’re either discharging a patient or receiving a post-operative patient. And one 
of the things I hated about floor nursing [laughs] is you had a phone on you—and 
it was the care manager trying to coordinate a charge, it was the CNA asking a 
question, it was maybe the doctor that had a question, or maybe a physical 
therapist or the pharmacy. It was just you were the core, and it was all these phone 
calls. Especially if you’re involved with a patient—I know you need to 
communicate and everything, but it just seemed to interfere with the patient care 
… Again at lunch time, med pass again, and by the end you’re doing your Is and 
Os (intake/output—recording what the patients eat and drink and pee, and so on), 
and it goes fast, and you had a routine—maybe a 2-4 hour routine—and no matter 
what you did, it was back to the patient. It was a busy role, and there’s nothing 
wrong with it—it is a good starting place for nurses—but it is what it is. And 
you’re dealing with a lot of moving pieces … And I guess it’s helpful to know 
that piece, but it is a busy role.” 
0.18.48 
Some of this work was specific to neurosurgical unit but feels that most places 
would have elements of this. 
0.19.27 
Floor nursing is work on an in-patient nursing. 
0.19.40 
This hospital had about 200 beds and was a Level 2 trauma center. 
0.19.52 
Then was in RN to MSN program, and you choose to do that to get the 
Bachelor’s, then the Master’s. This was still at Marian. Received Master’s in 
2015; so whole program, taken part-time, took about six years. 
0.21.01 
A ‘registered nurse’ is a license. Associate’s and Bachelor’s, or master’s or 
Doctorate, are different levels of nursing. And there’s also Diploma, but these are 
rarer. But no matter what level of education, you hold the same RN licenses, just 
at different levels of the license. There’s been some push to make all nurses have 
a Bachelor’s. But interviewee feels there isn’t a huge difference—some research 
component in the Bachelor’s, and some extra preparation for public health nurses. 
Sometimes people getting these are driven by institutional incentives or wanting 
to go into certain roles. 
0.23.06 
Interviewee took master’s because “I don’t like to be complacent. After two years, 
I did move to the operating room, and that was a whole other experience … It was 
basically continued growth, more autonomy as a provider, and I enjoyed being a 
student, plain and simple, that was just something I enjoyed.” 
0.23.53 
On work in the operating room: This is the actual surgery room where the actual 
procedures take place. “It was interesting, it’s a long, six-month orientation. So, 
there’s a lot of learning instruments and how to position a patient and this and 
that. It was a good experience—I really enjoyed it. It’s not as interactive—you 
know, the patient’s asleep, so your contact with the patient is very minimal … It 
just had a different—you really got to see more anatomy, which I really enjoyed. 
You got to see all sorts of different surgeries, trauma—it was just a really 
Page 4 of 7 
 
enriching experience, just to learn a little bit more in depth how the body works. 
And seeing the patients after surgery, it kind of gave some more perspective as to 
what happened before, and so seeing the whole thing in a circle was really helpful 
for me.” 
0.26.07 
On work as a nurse practitioner: Graduated in 2015. A nurse practitioner worked 
at the facility about a year before interviewee graduated; this person had 
significant experience. The facility developed time, working with neurosurgery, 
orthopedics, etc.; interviewee had worked with neurosurgery unit the most and 
was already familiar. This person took interviewee on as nurse practitioner, even 
before he graduated, which began the transition into this new role. Took on that 
role for a year and a half. 
0.27.38 
On the role of a nurse practitioner: “In that role, it’s very collaborative. I worked 
with the doctor—with the surgeon. We saw patients in the clinic, in the hospital, 
in the operating room. Some of it’s out-patient-based, in-patient-based, etc. It’s 
basically what providers do—whatever the provider may be—basically manage 
the patient’s condition, whatever the condition is. Nurse practitioners tend to be a 
little bit more in the realm of holistic and preventative as a history. So, nurse 
practitioners tend to work with patients a little bit differently. Not that one 
approach is better or worse or wrong or right. It’s just how we see patients and do 
what we do. So that role was good, busy, very stressful for me. So, I ended up 
taking a position in correctional health care, that’s what I do now … In this role, 
I’m a little more autonomous—I’m basically a primary care provider … just kind 
of a multi-modal approach as much as possible.” 
0.30.03 
On current role: “It’s a correctional facility, yeah. It’s an intake facility. So, the 
inmates come there for 8-12 weeks or so. They get their initial physical, dental, 
psych, and then it’s determined where they’ll go – I had worked at a maximum 
facility too, many of them are there for longer sentences, for violent crimes. So, 
depending on the length of sentence, some long term, some for short sentences.” 
0.31.22 
Has worked at two different correctional facilities. 
0.31.37 
On why wanted to work at correctional facilities: “It was something that was 
lucrative in terms of benefits and hours. That was appealing. But it is an 
environment where I did a practicum, kind of like a clinical, but it’s one-on-one 
with a nurse practitioner. So, I’d spent a semester in that setting. And the thing I 
enjoyed about it was that there was such a variety or exposure to diagnoses. And 
not even speaking about psychiatric—just medical. But obviously there’s a 
variety of psychiatric issues—depression, anxiety, psychoses. But leaving that 
aside, just the exposure to different medical diagnoses was intriguing to me—be it 
hepatitis C, rheumatoid conditions, a lot of addiction issues—that’s probably the 
highest mental health issue right now. But just the medical exposure was 
something I didn’t think I’d find anywhere else. But even if I did, they’d probably 
be something that would be handled by a specialist and I wouldn’t have direct 
exposure to or co-managing of. And obviously work/life balance as well.” 
0.34.21 
On nurse practitioner’s holistic approach: “Well, it’s are you treating a patient or a 
disease? And you try to do as much preventative healthcare and teaching as 
possible. And I think that’s probably the most important thing. If I could spend 
the whole day teaching a patient, that’d be great, but we don’t have time for that 
Page 5 of 7 
 
sort of thing. But that is probably the best thing is to educate the patients as much 
as possible so they can manage themselves, because when they leave your care or 
the corrections, they’re back on their own and they may have limited resources. 
So, having them manage on their own is very important. Involving sub-specialties 
as much as possible—psychiatry, psychology, etc. Working with the nursing 
staff—they’re really your eyes and ears—so if you educate them, you know what 
to expect. And I think that helps the patient as well. But I think the preventative 
healthcare is the most important thing, preventing disease, healthy lifestyle 
practices, sex practices. But there’s only so much you can do. But it’s just more 
looking at the patient versus the disease. Many times, patients just want someone 
to talk to, and they have anxiety. And a lot of time you just sit and talk and that 
alleviates a lot of issues right there. It’s just recognizing a lot of components.” 
0.36.40 
On working with the corrections population: “It’s hit and miss, some don’t care, 
some are very motivated. It just depends on the patient. Diabetes is a good 
example. Some want to get off insulin, want to do everything they can do. Others 
just order donuts from the commissary. I don’t know it’s specific to the 
corrections world versus the civilian world. It’s just the patient. Even sometimes, 
someone will come in for a DUI and be like, ‘I’m done with drugs.’ At some 
points, it may be that they’ve hit the bottom and are just done—I don’t know, I’m 
speculating on that. But it just depends on the patient.” 
0.38.18 
Hard to estimate number of patients that interviewee sees now, because they come 
and go so fast—but maybe 50-60 a week, or anywhere from 10-12 a day, 
sometimes more. 
0.39.23 
On dealing with the stress of nursing work in corrections and other environments: 
“It really depends on the role and how much you need to follow up. The 
neurosurgery job as a nurse practitioner was hard to manage stress, because you 
couldn’t take—you never stopped, really. It was just you couldn’t leave work at 
work. Many times, you were on call, you were calling patients at home. It was 
hard to deal with in that role. In this role, it’s easy; when I’m done, I’m done. Do I 
think about patients when I leave? Yes … And it’s hard to shut the brain off in 
what you do. But work/life balance is the important thing. But I cherish my 
weekends, and not a lot of jobs you have weekends off. And at least it’s a time 
that I have off—I can bike or hike or paint. I truly believe that you need an outlet. 
For me, it’s painting—I paint watercolors … But whatever it is, I think everybody 
needs an outlet, whether from their home life, their work life, whatever it is, that 
they can connect to.” 
0.41.51 
On work/life balance in nursing: Yes, especially if you have children. And “not to 
be sexist, but it is a pink-collar job, and from the 1970s it’s a female-drive career 
path. And many times, you’re a single mom, a working mom, whatever it is, and 
you have work at nights, weekends, on call, and I think it’s very difficult. And 
some people are workaholics and take as many shifts as they can. And you can 
only do that for so long before you break.” 
0.43.00 
Feels there is a danger of burnout, especially with forced overtime at some 
institutions. “And you can tell, when nurses get old, they’ve done it for 20 or 30 
years, and it’s time … Nursing there’s a lot of opportunity, and maybe it’s time 
for something else, and it’s time to teach or retire … Not all, but I’ve worked with 
Page 6 of 7 
 
enough nurses, and they’re good nurses, but they’re ready and they’ve lost the 
spark, so to speak.” 
0.44.07 
On nurses ‘eating their young’: “Nurses can be mean! And I can try to find videos 
for you if you want, but there’s videos out there—I think I’ve seen them—in my 
schooling maybe. They can be passive/aggressive. They can set younger nurses 
up for failure. And I don’t know why. I hope I was never like that. I don’t know 
why that is. I wish I understood it better. I don’t know if they’re threatened by 
younger nurses. We really need to help each other out … I’ve seen that, where a 
younger nurse asks for help or something, or they just aren’t overly helpful or too 
busy or whatever—and maybe it’s part of that whole burnout thing. And some 
nurses came to me—and I hope I’m not like that, because—I don’t think we even 
recognize when we do it. I don’t know why—I’ve never understood why we do 
it—especially when it comes to patient care. I don’t know—I wish I had a better 
response on that. I do see it.” 
0.45.54 
Feels that has experienced this to some degree himself. Feels that it’s correlated to 
some degree with managerial staff. “Some of the management styles I’ve worked 
with—I’ve seen bullying, and I think it’s just not effective. There’s a difference 
between management and leadership. I’ve seen a little bit of both. I’ve had good 
mentors … I think sometimes people have to prove themselves to another nurse 
before they’re going to say, ‘Oh you’re okay.’ And maybe it’s tough love too. I 
don’t know. I don’t know what it is, to be honest. It’s happened, I’m sure.” 
0.47.04 
On the qualities that make for a good mentor: “Experience. Willingness to help. 
Sometimes it just takes another look, on the mentee, to be open to feedback—
maybe you missed it—or open to another look. I’ve had good mentors. I have a 
friend who’s a PhD-prepared nurse, and she really was high-end on certification 
for nurses, to encourage certification and also professional organization—
organization specifically devoted to the nursing specialty. And that was huge—
those are the people you want to mentor you, the people who have a pulse on the 
field, on the politics of it, what’s new—those are the people you want to gravitate 
to, looking for those things.” 
0.48.51 
Was part of ARN [Association of Rehabilitative Nurses] as RN, and organizations 
for education for nurse practitioners in a variety of places in Wisconsin; finds it 
important to be involved in a variety of professional organizations—for 
networking, learning, education. 
0.49.48 
On future plans: is not sure about these; considered finishing terminal program in 
doctoral programs, or various certificate programs, and perhaps teaching. Feels 
happy with current role for the moment.  
0.50.41 
“It’s an excellent field. It’s something I’ve enjoyed in every role I’ve been in. I 
would encourage anybody that is thinking of going into nursing to consider 
shadowing people, working as a CNA, talking to people. I know myself 
personally I’ve spoken with people who have interest in nursing … It is a very 
rewarding field. There’s pros and cons. The economy makes a difference—patient 
census, insurance. You know, nurses have been laid off in the past—I don’t see 
anything like that in the near future; there’s such a demand. It’s a very versatile 
field, a very rewarding field, a very marketable field. You get sick of one thing; 
you can try something different. That’s what’s so appealing about it, is that 
Page 7 of 7 
 
there’s so many different opportunities at so many different levels … There’s 
good and bad to any job, it’s really something that’s very rewarding and very 
enriching. So, I would encourage anyone that has an interest to make their own 
stories.”
