LeAnne Howe:  I’m LeAnne Howe, Choctaw from Oklahoma. I’ll read from my poem set in 
Stonewall, Oklahoma, during the 1918 flu. This poem is about my grandmother who survived 
the 1918 flu pandemic, but her husband died in 1918. This is called “1918 Union Valley Road 
Oklahoma.” 
 
[LeAnne Howe reads “1918 Union Valley Road Oklahoma”] 
 
LH:  My name is LeAnne Howe. I was born and raised in Oklahoma and I’m an enrolled citizen of 
the Choctaw Nation. I’m a poet and playwright, novelist and scholar. But I’ll tell you a secret 
that I don’t think I’ve ever told anyone else before: I really wanted to be the female Will Rogers 
as I was growing up. I thought he was funny, ironic, and extremely talented, and I’ve seen most 
of his films. Life Begins at Forty is one of my favorite films. I thought all the time I was growing 
up I just would like to be the kind of insightful writer and comic that Will Rogers embodied as 
an Oklahoman. He’s really one of my heroes and he’s probably the reason that I thought that I 
could be a writer.  
 
So having said that, my house in Ada is my ancestral home and it’s not but about six blocks from 
the Chickasaw Nation tribal headquarters, in Ada. I really think I’m lucky. I’m surrounded by 
tribes and tribal people and kind of the ghosts of my ancestors, really, who lived in that house 
and lived around Ada. I have lots and lots of pictures and memories about spending my 
summers there in Ada, Oklahoma. Okay, that’s it. Thanks.
