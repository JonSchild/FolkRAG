Introductions 
00:00:35 
When Jade was growing up, her family used to use every big holiday as an excuse 
to bring everyone together for a 
huge feast. Foods would range from sushi to 
mashed potatoes to rolls to large plates of ginger, oranges, noodle dishes, and 
casseroles. It was a 
hybrid mix of Asian cuisine and Midwest American cuisine. 
Sometimes there would even be enchiladas and Mexican rice. It was very 
American in that it included a 
lot of different cultures. 
00:01:59 
Jade considers eating a 
hobby, so she has an extreme affection for it. She was 
always in the kitchen following her aunties around, watching them cook, and 
helping them with whatever they needed. 
00:02:48 
Jade always had a 
curiosity about where things were from and why they were 
eating certain things. Many times, she wanted to know what the food looked like 
before it became another consumable food. It wasn't until she was in her twenties 
that she actually took it upon herself to learn about food, culture, and what things 
are used and why. 
00:03:43 
From a 
young age, there were many Asian dishes that Jade was drawn to much 
more strongly than any of the Midwest American cuisine. She recalls the 
astonishment of her family when, at the age of six or seven, she started eating a 
large plate of sashimi at a 
family gathering. She was more naturally drawn to 
having a 
bowl of rice than a 
bowl of cheese. 
00:05:10 
When Jade was in her twenties, she started to realize that she was not only lactose 
intolerant, but also allergic to dairy. It limited what and where she could eat. This 
Jade Sato Interview Log, March 18, 2021

meant that she had to start cooking for herself, because it was the only way she 
knew she wouldn't get sick and have a 
reaction. 
Through more research and working with an acupuncturist, she learned that it's 
common for Asian people to be lactose intolerant, if not completely intolerant of 
dairy. They suggested she start eating the foods of her culture as a 
way to heal her 
body. It was a 
light bulb moment for her. She began cooking the foods of her 
culture before she started farming. However, at the same time, she was also 
curious about what ingredients were being used and where they came from. When 
she started getting more into the historical background of her culture's foods, she 
realized she had to grow it because no one else was. 
00:07:04 
Jade didn't realize she was craving flavors she had never tasted. She wanted to try 
shiso, and the first time she tried it, she couldn't stop eating it. She found herself 
craving the things that would heal her in the end. The determination to start 
growing all of that was otherworldly. It's an internal calling she can't really 
explain. 
00:08:18 
In 2013, Jade decided to save up money and quit her job in women's fashion to 
find out what her real passion was. That summer, her grandfather passed away. 
They were very close, and he set the tone for the culture of their family. When he 
passed, Jade realized there was a 
lot missing, especially when it came to her 
connection to food and culture. Her grandfather had worked in agriculture, and he 
did a 
lot of the cooking for their family. For Jade, searching for the flavors he 
would cook was another draw of getting into growing her own food and foods she 
couldn't find elsewhere. 
In 2013, she quit her job and tried to find starter jobs in agriculture. She 
approached her friend who was working at the farmers market, and she got her 
first job at Ela Family Farms in 2014. She was hooked. The fruit they grow and 
the way they grow it is spectacular. 
Through attending the farmers market, she started sinking her roots into the 
culture and getting to know the people around Colorado who are farming and 
selling at the farmers market. She also found little pockets of growers who are 
curious about other varieties of vegetables that aren't commonly found. 
00:11:37 
Jade talks about the biggest takeaways from her first season farming. First, she 
says she didn't have enough muscle. She also learned that she really wasn't very 
healthy. Because of her struggles with dairy, she needed to continue rehabilitating 
her body to keep up with farm work. She lost weight, but also started gaining 
more muscle. She used to have bad acne, but it cleared up after she started eating 
more fresh, local produce. She also learned that she doesn't know how to keep 
Jade Sato Interview Log, March 18, 2021

herself warm, dry, hydrated, or how to use sunscreen properly. There was so much 
she didn't know. 
As a 
kid growing up in her family's flower shop business, there were a 
lot of 
things people took care of for her that she didn't correlate with being an adult and 
having to do for herself. Farming taught her how to take care of herself better. 
00:13:19 
After the first season, she started working at a 
vegetable farm during the week and 
doing farmers markets on the weekends. It was her first introduction to row 
farming, and to the culture of farming in Colorado. She paid close attention to 
how they were growing things and what methods they used. 
She realized she loved farming, and she wanted to keep doing it. She liked the 
food and having access to the food and to sunshine. The desire to have her own 
farm started to grow. She didn't know what it would look like or what it would 
mean to her at the time. She just knew she is someone who gains a 
lot of 
perspective and humility from trying to do things herself. 
00:15:14 
Jade used her experience working on vegetable farms and on the fruit farm as a 
platform to imagine what she would do differently. 
00:15:43 
It was difficult finding farms to work on that fit her interests. Looking back, she 
wishes she had found a 
person of color mentor who was doing no-till, natural 
farming practices. Early on, she didn't know that was the kind of farmer she 
would want to be. There are also not that many farmers in Colorado that reflect 
what she looks for in a 
mentor, so she made her decisions based on word-of-
mouth. Friends who were in farming told her where they had worked and what 
their experiences were, which resulted in where she ended up going. 
00:16:54 
Jade discusses things she wanted to include on her own farm that were missing 
from others she had worked on. First, she emphasizes the need for diversity of 
people on farms. In the farming world, there's a 
great deal of talk about diversity 
of crops, but there's not much talk about diversity of people. When you include 
different kinds of people, problems or things that happen on farms are solved 
more effectively with different minds and perspectives. 
Second, Jade prefers for there not to be a 
real leadership structure. She feels like 
many farms are run like restaurant kitchens that are very hierarchical, military-
like, and kind of abusive. She liked farms with a 
little more chaos and anarchy in 
the system, which she thinks best mirrors nature. She also notes that the sense of 
failure decreases when you're approaching nature like that. Third, Jade says that 
incorporating rest culture and self care was important for her last year (in 2020).

00:20:31 
The farms Jade worked on were primarily white male-owned and white male-
staffed. The number of white women in agriculture is growing, but representation 
of women of color, especially Black women, is astonishingly low. Jade doesn't 
think we can have a 
healthy agricultural system if we don't bring everyone to the 
table. 
00:21:25 
Jade didn't think about her identity in relation to the white farm owners as much 
as she was forced to feel it due to their ignorance. She has had a 
lot of challenging 
and painful experiences on farms, especially with white, cisgender men. On her 
farm, she has a 
zero-tolerance policy for any of that behavior. Nothing will 
change in agriculture until we have more representation of other people. The 
behavior she experienced won't be called into question unless we have that 
representation and a 
place for others to be heard. 
00:23:27 
Jade has been very lucky to have good co-workers during her time farming. 
She believes most young people who are in farming are coming to farming with 
the tools to change how the whole system works, from equity to capitalism to the 
politics of it all. She has found refuge in her contemporaries, because they are also 
challenging the power structure of farming. 
00:24:30 
Jade hit her wits' end working on other people's farms. When she first started 
getting into farming, only the idea of wanting to own her own farm was 
percolating. By the time she hit year six of working on other people's farms, she 
had a 
laundry list of things she didn't agree with and things she thought were 
excellent. That list of things she didn't like started to include herself and being in 
those environments. She realized she was burned out and took a 
year off to refresh 
and confirm that she loved farming. She saved money to start the farm in 2019 
and held a 
Kickstarter campaign in January of 2020 to increase her funding. Her 
desire not to work on anyone else's farm was the impetus for Jade to take the leap 
of faith and start her own farm. 
00:26:54 
The first vegetable farm Jade worked for was owned by Tim and Claudia Ferrell 
in Brighton, Colorado. Jade emailed them in the winter of 2018 to see if she could 
lease some of their land to experiment with cover cropping and overhead 
irrigation. In 2019, she did just that. It was a 
gateway for her. Once she had 
access to land, it gave her confidence she could actually start her own farm. 
00:28:07 
Jade is on that same piece of land now. She can't afford to buy and own her own 
land, and she also struggles with the concept of land ownership. She would like 
there to be a 
land tax that benefits First Nations peoples, and before she could 
ever own land, she would like to see a 
more solid structure for who benefits from 
how much she's paying to buy land.

00:28:58 
Jade's farm is a 
two-acre operation. 
00:29:13 
She is the only one working on the farm in all of the roles. 
00:29:49 
She doesn't really have a 
business model. Like with many things on the farm, 
things pop up and happen when they need to. She got funding to help build 
infrastructure from her Kickstarter campaign in 2020. Combined with the savings 
she acquired from six years of working, she was able to avoid debt as much as 
possible. 
Jade is trying to be a 
year-round farmer to make food accessible to people all year. 
When farmers take the winter off, she worries about the people who are not 
eating, or who do not have access to food during those months. She also misses 
growing during that time. As long as she's happy growing, she'll keep going. 
Jade goes to the Denver farmers markets on the weekends and has a 
CSA 
(Community Supported Agriculture) model with summer and winter shares. She's 
trying to figure out how to do spring and fall shares as well. The majority of her 
share members are Asian American families, but there are also very mixed 
families, which reflects more of the current American experience. 
It's been fun for Jade to see who responds to the farm and the shares. It's easy for 
her to access a 
lot of East Asian vegetables, but she would love to grow more 
South Asian crops. The more familiar the farm becomes socially, the more people 
are warming to the idea of approaching her and asking her to grow specific crops 
for them. 
00:33:18 
The number one crop request from customers is shiso and perilla. Shiso is an herb 
that Asian and non-Asian people alike are craving. People were also very excited 
when she announced she would be growing bitter melon in 2021. Personally, Jade 
has never had bitter melon, but she is hoping to make a 
recipe for bitter melon 
that comes from a 
Chinese friend's family. 
00:34:55 
When deciding what to grow last year, Jade took a 
number of factors into 
consideration. First, she thought about the things she was tired of growing, such 
as beets. Next, she thought about crops that she wasn't experienced in or didn't 
have permission to try on other farms, such as shiso, okra, and Japanese icebox 
watermelons. She points out that a 
lot of farms she worked on were very 
concerned about the price per pound of their vegetables, and although she 
understands why, she believes it's a 
very narrow way to farm. 
The crops she's excited about growing are the ones her customers are also going 
to be excited about. Her customers understand that she's a 
small farmer and will 
Jade Sato Interview Log, March 18, 2021

charge more. It's exciting to find things you can't find anywhere else, and it's fun 
to buy fun food. 
00:36:58 
Many of the crops Jade is growing are meaningful to her. However, eggplant is 
particularly significant. When she was little, she remembers going with her 
grandfather to a 
farm north of Denver, where he taught her how to harvest 
eggplant. Whenever she works with eggplant, she feels like she is communicating 
with her grandfather. 
00:38:39 
Jade's family is very proud of her decision to farm, but also concerned at the same 
time. They come from the perspective of having worked on farms in agriculture 
for a 
very long time so she could have a 
different future. While she did go to 
college and do well academically, it also didn't feel right for her not to be outside 
in the soil. Her family understands that sentiment. 
00:40:10 
Because of COVID, Jade hasn't been able to share many of her vegetables with 
her own family. She wants to make more of a 
concerted effort to do deliveries for 
them so that they can stay safe and healthy with access to good vegetables. 
00:41:30 
Jade is a 
firm believer that the future is unwritten. Aside from the crop plan, she 
only tries to plan for a 
couple of weeks out. The pandemic helped her realize that 
if she's going to be growing, she can't just go to farmers markets. She wanted to 
include more families, so she ended up offering some CSA shares to provide 
consistent nutrients for the families who signed up. If any shift happened, the 
pandemic shifted her to do more than she originally planned. 
00:42:49 
Jade wasn't conscious of everything that happened in 2020. She, like many, 
couldn't catch up with everything going on and was in a 
mindset of living it and 
digesting it next year. 
September through November, she was the most stressed out she's ever been. A 
lot of the stress of the season caught up with her, including the stress of the 
business; trying to stay safe; keeping up with constantly changing information; 
and the political issues coming to the surface for a 
lot of white people. 
00:44:48 
Jade reflects on some positive things that came out of 2020. First, she became 
more in touch with what she wants from life. Her relationships have also gotten 
stronger, and she's communicating with people more. She says the best thing to 
come out of 2020 and the pandemic is cooking more Asian food at home. She 
spent time demystifying recipes she has always wondered about, including the 
scallion pancake. She and her partner began to derive more comfort out of Asian 
food. 
Jade Sato Interview Log, March 18, 2021

00:47:04 
She's using her own produce in the recipes they're cooking, and she's finally 
tasting the flavors of the restaurant they go to, or the flavors of her auntie, uncle, 
or grandpa. She's actually tasting how the food is prepared, and it feels very 
rewarding on multiple levels. 
00:48:17 
The immigrant community from Latin America has been extremely reliable and 
supportive of Jade. Because she is a 
small farm on her own in the middle of a 
big 
farming area, migrant farmers are like her co-workers. They work side-by-side on 
the same land, and they pay attention to what she's doing. If something is going 
wrong, they show up with support for her. That community has been the backbone 
of her experience. There's a 
ton of knowledge and skill in the migrant labor 
community, and she watches them to learn many of their techniques and 
strategies. Jade values them tremendously and is very appreciative of their 
presence. 
00:51:10 
It wasn't until Jade was brainstorming about what kind of farmer she wanted to be 
that she realized she wanted to grow vegetables of Asian cultures. It didn't occur 
to her until later in her farming experience that her heritage would impact the kind 
of farmer she is. Everything is connected. Wanting to farm, being an Asian farmer, 
her motivations for farming, and what she grows are all tied together. 
00:53:11 
Farming has strengthened Jade's identity and Asian American community. 
Conversely, she believes the stronger her Asian American identity gets, the better 
farmer she's going to become. Becoming more connected with the food culture 
and the foodways of the people in her life (friends, family, customers) is building 
her confidence to claim and hold that space for her own identity to grow and 
change within the phrase "person of color"/"woman of color." 
00:54:36 
When Jade first got into farming, she was concerned about tokenizing herself as 
someone who focuses on Asian vegetable varieties. She wanted to grow food with 
meaning for people who craved it. When she was farming previously, she didn't 
really get an education on Asian vegetables, because none of the white farmers 
she worked for grew them. She notes that with the release of the film Minari, 
people are learning that minari is a 
crop and are buying the seed online. 
Jade has found other Asian American farmers on social media. Even before she 
started her own farm, they set the tone for how to discuss identity in farming as an 
Asian person, especially with the historical background in the United States. She 
feels like there's more awareness of the Asian American identity in any profession 
right now, which is encouraging. 
00:57:49 
Jade talks about her family's history, describing it as one of the Japanese 
American experience. Her great-grandfather, a 
descendent of rice farmers in 
Jade Sato Interview Log, March 18, 2021 
7 
Nagoya, Japan, arrived in the U.S. in the nineteenth century. He ended up in 
California as a 
farmer, where he proceeded to have thirteen children who worked 
on the farm. When World War II hit, Jade's entire family was imprisoned in the 
Japanese internment camps. Her great-grandfather ended up working on a 
chicken 
sexing farm in Minnesota during the war. The amount he was paid (about nineteen 
dollars a 
month) didn't make up for what the family had lost. 
After the war, Colorado welcomed Japanese Americans into the state. Jade's 
entire family relocated there and gave up on what was their farmland in Stockton, 
California. At that point, her grandfather started a 
grocery store and then later 
opened Sato's Flowers in Littleton, Colorado. This history informed a 
lot of Jade's 
farming experience and identity. Her grandfather and great-grandfather set an 
example for her and showed her that it was possible to farm as an Asian person. 
1:02:24 
With her family's agricultural background, farming feels very comfortable for 
Jade. It also feels like she's still in dialogue with them. It makes her very happy. 
1:02:55 
Some of Jade's favorite customers are members of the elderly Japanese 
community who stumble upon her farm at the farmers market. Many younger 
folks find Jade through social media. She has had one family of older Japanese 
Americans love and support what she's growing. They have even come to help 
her on the farm. Through that experience, she got to hear about their family's 
relation to plants and crops, family flavors, and family stories. Jade treasures the 
moments when people share their family's connection to certain plants, much like 
her connection to eggplant. 
1:05:25 
Jade has quite a 
few people come through, some of whom are younger, that have 
family who were also in the internment camps. Many of their families moved to 
Hawaii, and through the combining of cultures there, developed a 
different way of 
eating. It's fascinating for Jade to hear about how families from Japan mix their 
traditions with other cultures. Jade's family has always had ties with Hawaii, too. 
It's fun for her to hear about what other families do with their food culture and 
traditions, and even how they break those traditions. 
It makes Jade happy to see that there's not really a 
focus on the authenticity of 
cuisine. She thinks that white culture often puts heavy emphasis on the 
authenticity of food from other cultures when it really has no idea. Every region 
in every country is different, as is every family. It's nice for Jade to see that 
authenticity challenged. 
1:08:11 
When writing the business plan for her farm, Jade's hope was to sell to Asian 
American people, but also to anyone who would come to her with things they 
wanted to see grown. Although there's only so much she can do in Colorado to 
Jade Sato Interview Log, March 18, 2021 
8 
control the growing environment, she will cater to any community that's 
underrepresented. However, she will only grow for that community until they feel 
like they have a 
representative in the farming community who is growing what 
they want. For example, Jade grows collards. She's happy to support the Black 
community by growing collards, because very few white folks know what they 
are. She says, though, that she would stop growing them if there was a 
Black 
farmer at the farmers market growing collards. She doesn't want to compete with 
them. 
She tries to keep that in mind when she's growing things, because there's cultural 
significance to everything we eat. She wants to grow for everyone that feels like 
they don't have their farmer yet. Ultimately, though, she wants to be the farmer 
for the people she relates with more culturally. 
1:10:21 
In the future, Jade would like to get better at growing Asian varieties and spend 
the time to get to know the plants she's working with. She likes to focus primarily 
on greens, such as the mustard greens Wasabina and Green in the Snow, and she 
would like to get better at growing them. She is in the midst of figuring out what 
greens are most successful in the summer, and which ones are good for the winter. 
1:12:38 
Within the broader food system, Jade would like to see more accessibility for 
anyone who eats. Some foods are made inaccessible because of price or location. 
She is currently working on a 
project to get all of the farmers markets in Colorado 
to accept and welcome SNAP/EBT (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Plan/ 
electronic benefits transfer) dollars. She feels like for so long, farmers markets 
have only incorporated one class of people, and a 
lot of times in Colorado, one 
race of people. 
She would like to see reparations for Black farmers or any Black folk, land back 
programs for First Nations peoples, and the return of food sovereignty to the 
Native American community. 
1:14:50 
Jade advises other people of color who are trying to get into farming to find their 
mentors. That's what she didn't know she should have been looking for ten years 
ago, and only now that she has her own farm is she starting to find people. She 
wishes it had happened earlier. Find a 
mentor or someone who you relate to on 
multiple levels, including culturally and even financially. 
1:16:39 
Hapa is a 
Hawaiian term used to describe someone half white and half anything 
else. In the past, it was used more specifically to describe Asian mixed kids. 
Recently, Jade has tried to get away from using that word to describe herself 
publicly, because it's not a 
word that's hers or part of her culture. 
Jade Sato Interview Log, March 18, 2021 
9 
Being half white has afforded her a 
lot of privileges. She has white-passing 
privileges that a 
lot of her Asian friends and family don't necessarily have. From 
the Asian American experience of being half Asian and half white, Jade says 
being a 
mixed race kid is like being the black sheep in two different family 
photos. You stand out in one family because you're not white enough, and you 
stand out in the other family because you're not Asian enough. That comes with a 
lot of questions about belonging and acceptance. She is still trying to get to know 
and become more comfortable with her biracial identity. It's so intersectional, and 
it's also more complicated, because she's a 
woman. 
Jade thinks she has been privileged enough to get access to land, because she's 
more white-passing. She hasn't been able to have the banks take her seriously for 
loans, because she won't have a 
co-signor. She has experienced racism and 
sexism on the farms where she has worked. However, being white-passing, she 
can also call out bad white behavior a 
little bit more comfortably and safely.
