Lina is talking, but it is difficult to transcribe her conversation.
J:  You were close, eleventh.
T:  Eleventh?  
J:  I shouldn't forget that, that's the day I buried my brother.  What was left of him.
T:  Today is the 11th, okay, and we're on Suffolk Street.  
J:  120 Suffolk Street.
T:  120 Suffolk Street.  Okay.  All right.  Why don't we start Joe with just some basic 
information, like your birthday, where you were born, when?
J:  My name is Joseph Tymowicz.  I was born in Lowell, Mass., August the 29th, 1920.  Let's see,
at the North Common in the Acre here. 
T:  Were you actually born in one of the rooms in the Common?  Or were you born in the 
hospital?
J:  Um, I was born in a room  (T:  Umhm)  They must have had a midwife.  At that time there 
was no such thing as doctors, you know.  So.
T:  And your parents were from?
J:  Poland.
T:  From Poland.
J:  Yeah, they come over in the ship.  (T: Umhm)  My mother come over with her brother.  My 
father come over with his brothers too.  So.  They come in and they both met down here in 
Lowell, and they got married.  
T:  What kind of work did they do?
J:  Uh, my father, he was a, mill work I believe.  (T:  Uh huh)  Everybody at that time was in a 
mill doing some kind of a work, you know?  And he was a violin player, and maybe played a 
little on the side.  (T:  Is that right?)  Oh yeah, so.  (T:  Wow)  I mean when the people got 
married at that time, remember when I was a little kid over here on Adams Street, there used to 
be some empty stores.  They'd get the violin players together, and maybe an accordion you know.
That was the whole wedding.  They went down the church, and then they had this hall, they'd fix 
it up with all kinds of Polish food.  And then they started playing and your old music would start 
going, and good old Polish blast would start you know, coming around.  Is at that time was the, 
well it was before the depression, I believe they uh, couldn't sell whiskey or beer at that time, but
what Polish fellow wouldn't have a little whiskey in his house on the side that they made it, you 
know?  So.  Everybody, they had enough and usually at every Polish wedding there'd be always a
little fight.  (T:  Is that right?)  Oh sure!  What the hell.  Never ended it without a fight at one of 
those weddings.  
T:  [Laughs]  Did the Polish stay, stick together in the North Common?
J:  Well yeah.  This was one of the areas right here on Adams Street.  And they used to call it 
Fenwick Street, where all the housing is right now.  And then, in Centraville there's a Polish 
district there, if you know where the Polish dome is up there, off Lakeview Avenue, up in the 
back there.  That used to be a Polish area.  It still is.  There's still quite a few Polish people.  
Around here, well they're practically all gone.  I'm just about, myself and maybe a few other 
Polish people that live around here now.  
T:  What?  When did you move out of North Common?  
J:  Oh I can't remember that.  I remember playing at the North Common.  But my mother, we uh, 
like I say, I was about two years old when my father died.  So my mother went to work in a mill, 
and I know that she moved from one place to another, you know, from one apartment to another 
apartment.  There was four of us in the family that she had to bring up.  And at that time there 
was no such thing as welfare.  (T:  yeah)  It was either make it, or break it, or starve.  And my 
mother had to like I say, go to work and make a buck here and there.  So she did.  And as far as 
living, she lived here in the, we did rather, in the Acre.   All our life I lived here on LaGrange 
Street, 1416 LaGrange Street, on Broadway, Adams Street, yeah, and Adams Street again.  It 
used to be right across from Saint Patrick's, there used to be all homes right along there.  I 
remember that very well, because I got a little boo boo there playing with another little boy.  
[Laughs]  So uh, I mean uh, not the way you think.  I, you know, I got wacked with one of these 
sewer things that were playing in the, before I went to school.  And I went to Saint Patrick's 
School.  (T: You did?)  Yeah, oh yeah.  I went till I was uh, what is it, around sixteen.   
T:  And Saint Patrick's Church too when you [few words unclear].  
J:  Oh yes!  I had to go.  And then you had to go to church every Sunday boy.  The sisters, if you 
were under the first, up to the, I forget what was it, the fifth grade, or sixth grade you was under 
the nuns.  And after that it was under the brothers.  (T:  Uh huh)  And there was this senior 
Brother, his name was Brother John.  And boy, he always carried this little, little uh, what do you 
call it?  Bamboo?  
T:  Uh huh.
J:  Up his sleeve, you know?  And if he caught you doing anything wrong boy, he'd just call you 
over.  And he's say either lift your hand up, you either got it on the hand or on the rare end.  And 
boy that really hurt.  If you know, ever got hit with a bamboo you know what I'm talking about.  
But I'm telling you, we had to learn, and we learned.  With the Brothers and Sisters we learned 
pretty good.  And there's no such thing as television at that time.  There's no such thing as radio.  
My mother had to burn wood and coal if she could get coal.  At that time, when I went to Saint 
Patrick's School, the first things I did was run from school and the old clothes, I'd change clothes 
and go up the tracks by the Lowell Gas House and look around for any coal that's laying around, 
you know, pick it up and throw it in the bag.  I'm going to tell you that, that I picked it up you 
know, off the tracks because, sometimes walk two or three miles down the tracks picking up 
coal.  And that was put away for the winter time.  And when they pulled up these ties, you know 
the ties from railroad tracks?  (T:  from the railroad tracks?)  We brought those home.  I had those
little carriage, we brought that, and that was our pleasure in the summertime, cutting ties for the 
wintertime, and chopping them, you know.  That was the fun.  Today, like I say, you got this TV, 
excuse me a second, I want to shut this off.  And if we're lucky, if I was lucky to get a bag of 
coal, extra, to make any kind of money.  We used to have the Royal Theater over here on 
Merrimack Street, and the Rialto.  And I think the admission at that time was ten cents to get in, 
and Friday was two movies, about three cartoons, and a serial.  And you had to see that serial 
every Friday.  I don't know about yourself, but when we were kids (--)  So once in awhile I could
sell a bag of coal to some other elderly people, you know, that need it.  And I sold it to them and 
bring home a quarter and take my mother. 
T:  Is that right?
J:  That was our big treat once in awhile, to go to the show like the Royal Theater, that was it.  
But there was no such thing as going in cars and everything like that.  I think I was only about, 
first bike I ever got I was about fifteen years old.  The rest of the time was mostly walking.  I 
remember transportation was right over here on Broadway.  There was a railroad car, I mean a 
Trolley car like you got in the Historic Park right now.  It used to run up Broadway, and it run all 
the way up to North Chelmsford.  And that's where my cousins lived.  So that's another big treat 
we used to have.  That, my mother used to take us on the trolley car when we lived on Broadway,
that was 169 I think, that was Broadway there.  Get on a trolley and it was at that time, what, a 
nickel a passenger, something like that.  And it took us almost all the way up the Crystal Lake.  
And my cousins lived up there.  My aunt and her uncle.  And he had a cow and chickens, and 
everything like that.  And the milk and everything.  So when we come back home we were 
loaded with apples, milk and everything like that.  Boy I'm telling you, that was a ball up there, 
out on the farm.  And at Crystal Lake.  Have you gone up to North (T:  Uh huh, yeah, yeah) 
Chelmsford?  Yeah?  I'd do a little fishing there.  And like I say, that was it.  That was our 
pleasure.  
T:  You fished?
J:  Fished, sure, and play in the hay, you know, in the fields over there.  In the woods.  
T:  What language did your mother speak Joe?  
J:  Polish.  
T:  So what did you grow up speaking?  What was your first language?
J:  Polish.  Polish, and I learned with the kids out in the street, you know what I mean?  (T:  Uh 
huh)  And going to Saint Patrick's School.
T:  But how, that's one thing I was going to ask.  Didn't some of the Poles, ain't there a Polish 
Church, Polish National Church in town?  
J:  Not at the time when I was born.  (T:  Okay)  At the time I was, I don't believe there was a 
Polish Church in Lowell at that time when I was born.  So everything was done over here at 
Saint Patrick's.  In fact I, it's too bad I didn't dig it up.  I don't think it says it on my mother's what
do you call it?  Certificate of marriage, where they were married, but I know I've got it there 
someplace.  
T:  So were there many other Poles at Saint Patrick's at that time?
J:  Yeah, we had to go to Saint Patrick's Church, yeah.  That was the only catholic school around.
So my mother lived on Adams Street, and Saint Patrick's was right across the street.  I was 
fortunate enough that the priest would let us you know, myself and my brother go at that school.  
(T:  Right)  My sister and my brother went for awhile, and then they had to leave and they went 
to Bartlett School.  so.
T:  And how much school did you end up going to?
J:  Not very much.  Eight grade.  (T:  Eight grade)  And then they come out with this, good old 
Roosevelt come out with the CCC's.  And my mother was pretty hard up.  And like I was telling 
you, I'd make a quarter on coal, or something like that.  So I signed up.  I re-enlisted for the CCs 
for six months.  Shipped up, I was fortunate, I was shipped up here to North Andover in the 
woods.  And the work was chopping trees, building roads and every thing like that.  I enjoyed it.  
I had muscles.  The food was good.  And they sent my mother a check every month for 
twenty-five dollars, and I got five dollars.  And you think five dollars, boy that went a long way.  
And that (--)
T:  Didn't you tell me that you used your brother's name to get in?
J:  Well I didn't want to mention it on this little thing over here.  [Laughs]  Yeah, I was only 
sixteen but you know, to help out my mother.  Because my brother was working over here on 
Fletcher Street.  There was a garage you know.  And he was doing a little mechanical work.  And 
then they had started I think it was ERA, or WPA at that time.  My brother went on that.  And he 
was making I forget what.  They were paying about uh, everybody worked about two or three 
days a week.  And he made about four or five dollars out of that.  And the other brother worked 
in a garage.  He just made tips.  All right?  There was no such thing as work.  Boy you had to beg
for work if you (--)  On the farm.  Before I forget, I used to, in the summertime, there used to be 
Alexander's Market down here on Merrimack Street, on the corner.  And I knew some of the 
guys there.  And we uh, I started talking to him.  And one guy had a farm there that he brought 
his produce to the Alexander's to sell.  And he gave me a job at the farm.  He picked me up in his
car and I went up there, and I worked for five cents an hour.  (T:  wow!)  That was, that was 
delicious, because I mean uh, make about fifty, and dollar a week.  That was a lot of money for 
me.  At least I could you know, buy some candy, go to a show.  There was no such thing as me 
being able to afford a milk shake, (T:  Right) or a banana split.  But those crab bags they used to 
sell in the stores, the big bag for a nickel.  And uh, my sister, she worked for some people, some 
rich people.  And they used to take her to camp out on the Lake someplace there.  And she used 
to get around, I don't know, four or five dollars a week.  No, three.  Excuse me, she started out 
with three.  After that she was about ready to quit on them, and they raised their salary to five 
dollars a week.  And that was seven days a week.  
T:  What did she do?  What kind of work?
J:  Housework.
T:  Housework.  
J:  You know, they took her out to the camp and she did all you know, washing the dishes and 
helping with the cooking.  Cleaning clothes and things like that.  And they had little room for her
where she was just a regular maid.  
T:  And that was people that lived in Lowell, like up on another neighborhood in Lowell?
J:  Yeah, like a doctors and lawyers, and things like that, you know?  (T:  Umhm)  They hired her.
So that, that, everyone of us, as soon as we turned old enough to get a job, or if we could find a 
job we helped out our mother.  So she worked up till let's see.  Oh I can't remember what year.  
But after that she quit and we all got started working, and we were living here on LaGrange 
Street.  And she was fifty three years old I remember at that time, and we just started.  I just 
started working full time at New Market Manufacturing cleaning drop wires for the looms that 
weave cloth.  And the poor woman had a heart attack and she passed away, just as we were all 
you know, gone to work, and we were making pretty good money at that time, you know, fifteen,
twenty dollars bringing home a week was something out of the ordinary.  So that was a very 
shame.  And it was 1939 she died.  And then we stuck together over here on LaGrange Street.  
One of my brothers got married, the one I just, I buried today.  Then forty-one as you know what 
happened,  Pearl Harbor broke out.  My brother went in, I went in, and we went in the service.  
So I stayed in the service from forty-one, and until the war was over.  And they uh, kind of 
begged me, the Officers in the service, the Captain of mine, he says, "Joe, everybody is leaving 
us, and we need men like you to train some of the other guys you know, coming overseas, 
because uh, for the different places."  And I was at 64 General Hospital at that time.  And I 
signed up for three years like a dumbbell.  [Laughs]  So I figures (--)
T:  Three more years.
J:  Three more years.  I figured, what the heck, I'll stay with my wife and kid over here, you 
know?  (T:  Yeah)  So I come back home for a three month furlough.  I went back, I went back to
Italy.  There's a long story about you know, them not wanting to send me there.  They didn't want
to send me to Germany because they said that was a combined [unclear] of operations at that 
time.  But I was fortunate enough to switch with another guy, Sergeant.  He went, he wanted to 
go to Germany, I wanted to go to Italy, and we had a good Sergeant that switched papers for us.  
And I went back to Italy, and I was fortunate enough again to get to Rome.  They places me in 
Rome.  I was suppose to go on the MP's, but the Major told me that he had a better job for me 
running the PX.  Looked at my records.  He seen I was pretty good.  And I ran a PX there for 
about what, a year and a half?  (Wife:  unclear)  For a year and a half.  And I had a nice 
apartment there in Rome.  So that was the life.  (T:  That was the life)  Until nice friends of ours, 
the Russians, signed the ratification, they were scared we were too close to them in Italy.  And 
they gave us, what was it?  Ninety days to get out?  (Wife:  Yeah, unclear).  We had to get out in 
ninety days.  I left my wife over there and I come back to the states.  And I had about a year, a 
little more than a year to go, about a year and a half.  That's how I ended up in Fort Brag, and 
then Fort Benny.
T:  Right.  Well how, tell me about how you all met actually, you know, the time you met?
J:  Over there?  My brother ran a little store there in Africa, you know?  
Wife:  My brother got a little store, a little store in Africa, you know?  
T:  Uh huh.
J:  And as soon as I went in there I noticed her and I, you know, got a liking to her.  And I kept 
coming in every day practically.
T:  That's in North Africa?
J:  North Africa, Oran, you know?  (T:  Uh huh)  So she got an eye out for me too.  Her brother 
threw me out a couple of times, because he figured I was getting a little too serious with her.  But
it's lucky that she liked me.  (Wife:  And we take off)  And we took off and got hitched.  
T:  You took off?
J:  Yeah, we got married.  
Wife:  I take off and go with him.  
T:  Did you tell your family you were leaving?
Wife:  No!
J:  No, no, no, no.  It was just her, her and her brother were there at the time.
Wife:  My brother.  I take off go with him. 
J:  And the rest of the family was in Sicily.  (T:  Oh, okay)  Messina, Sicily.  (T:  Uh huh)  
Wife:  That's because my brother [unclear].
J:  After, you know, that's the way they do it in Europe, all right?  In Europe if your family 
doesn't agree, or something like that, then they want to you know, get married to him, they elope.
They take off.  And they stay about two or three days, and then they come back, and then the 
family can't do nothing.  (T:  Right)  All right?  Because their honor is gone.  So you got to marry
him.  Either you marry her, or you're going to get, like I told you, a shot gun.  [All laugh]  (T:  
Right)  So the brother said okay, that's it.  So that's the way I met her.  So.  And she was lucky 
enough.  I uh, after what do you call it?  We made the invasion of Sicily, and she went home, 
then I went further up north and I ended up in [unclear], Italy.  (T: Umhm)  And that's where I 
stayed.  I stayed in uh, what was it?  I got a good job after that in the 5th Base Post Office, right? 
(Wife:  Yeah)
T:  So you all got married before the war was over?
J:  Oh yes.  
Wife:  Oh yes.  We made it like in the Army.  You remember Joe? (J:  Oh yeah)  We made it like 
in the Army [unclear].  Do you understand me?  They, do not touch me!  You understand?  
[Comment unclear]
J:  Yeah, because if, if, if I, if I, I, I tried it with my Captain, or tried it with my Lieutenant.  They 
says he, these women are no good.  You, you uh, you know, you got to go through a lot of 
bologna.  And I had to, a lot of paper work.  Signing this and signing my life away.  They says, 
you don't know what you're doing, you're too young yet to get married, you know?  And these 
women over here, they, you're going to marry them.  They're just marrying you for your $10,000.
(T:  Umhm)  You know what I mean?  (T: Right)  We had this insurance.  I says, hey, you don't 
want to do it?  Okay.  So the wife and I uh, got hitched outside.  
Wife:  And we married (--)
T:  And nobody knew it.
J:  Nobody knew it.  Not in the army.  No, no.  
Wife:  But we got married [unclear].  I got a paper, [unclear], I got a paper.  [Comment unclear]
J:  Yeah, Italians, you know?  
Wife:  Italia Police, do you understand?  [Unclear]
T:  Uh huh, right.  Mosselina.  
Wife:  You know, by the law the woman who go out with American soldier [unclear].  That's it.  
After him (--)
J:  After we uh, got uh, past what do you call it?  I say, after I ended up and I got a good spot 
there in [Laycon?], in the 5th Base Post Office, I sent for her.  And she come up to [Laycon?].  
And that was in what year?  1944?  (Wife:  44)  44, yeah!  
T:  That's in North Italy, Northern Italy?
J:  Northern Italy.  Yeah, we got up, they were fighting in Bolonia at that time.  
Wife:  At that time they fight in Bolonia.
J:  A little past Florence.  You say you've been up there.  So.  (T:  Yeah, yeah)  They were fighting
in Bolonia at that time.  And we were in uh (--)
Wife:  You were in the hospital at that time.
J:  No, I worked for the Post Office for awhile, remember?  (Wife:  unclear)  I was driving a big 
truck delivering the mail up to the front.  
Wife:  Yeah.  Now you go to work in the hospital [unclear].
J:  Oh that's after.  (Wife:  after, yeah)  After, after, after.  That's after the war was over with 
Germany.  Remember when they gave up?
Wife:  Yes, yes.  That's in Laycon.  We live in Laycon.  
J:  Yeah, well that's uh, that's when I got in the hospital after that.  
Wife:  The kid, we got the kid.  All right.  I got pregnant right away.  I left it to my mother, the 
kid.  (T:  Okay)  I'm going back with him.  With him, I'm going back with him.  We leave Laycon
in peace huh?  Boom boom, America with Italia.  (T:  Uh huh)  Close.  We close.  [Comment 
unclear]
J:  And I stayed with the hospital, that's right, I stayed with the hospital.  And then they started 
shipping everybody out, going for the other front to Japan.  I was over there already three years 
for crying out loud.  They're ready to push me too.  I'm going bananas, you know?  All of a 
sudden, well I can't say, a lot of people died, atomic bomb and everything like that.  (T:  Right)  
And that just, they gave up.  And so I was fortunate enough to stay at that hospital.  Remember?
Wife:  When we live in Laycon you got to, six o'clock you know, people no walk in the street no 
more at night.  What they call it?
J:  A curfew.
T:  Curfew.  
Wife:  Yeah.  Impossible to walk.  (T:  Uh huh)  They say seven, eight o'clock in the morning you
got to stay in.  Very bad.  I live across the street to the hospital, american hospital.  Remember 
Joe, we lived across the street to the american hospital?  
J:  Yeah.  And I had a nice little place there and I had the German prisoners of war make me 
either birthday cakes sometimes.  Bring a meal home to me.  Oh!  
Wife:  Oh yes.  The Germans. The Germany soldiers.
J:  So you can imagine why I re-enlisted for three years.  I figured you know, that's going to be a 
good twenty-year deal, especially after going through a depression, you know?  Because the 
depression just got over when the war started.  (T:  Right)  We just started work, you know, the 
WPA and things like that.  And uh, everybody was just started to work when the war broke out.  
So I figure, what the heck.  I might as well spend twenty years in the service, or twenty-five, 
thirty.  (T:  Take care of you, yeah) 
Wife:  All right.
J:  At the time I went in I was getting $25.00 a month, remember?  No, no, in Africa we got a 
raise.  The government gave us a raise to $30.00 in Africa.  
Wife:  Yes.  After you go to Laycon, you come in America, remember?
J:  Yeah. 
Wife:  You got back, you come after Rome.  
J:  That's after I re-enlisted again Lina.  
Wife:  You come after Rome.  Okay.
J:  After I re-enlisted.  
Wife:   He sent for me to go back to take me in Rome.  And we live in Rome.
J:  After I got an apartment fixed up for you and everything.
Wife:  Yes.  We got an apartment on Italia farm.  Rent a room.  (T:  Uh huh)  [Unclear].
J:  Oh yeah.  The use of the kitchen and everything.  Nice balcony, was about five floors.  Was it 
five or six floors?  (Wife:  six?)  Six floors up.  And you could see part of Rome, and you could 
see Saint Peters.  (Wife:  we lived in a beautiful city, Rome)  It was beautiful.  I lived like I'm 
telling you, nice!  And I ran his PX.  I was second in charge.  There was a Captain first, and he 
went back to America.  Then a Lieutenant Lane.  I'll never forget his name.  I took over with him 
until his Master Sergeant took over, and I was third in charge.  But we used to run this whole PX 
and I used to go from Rome up to Laycon with this big van, pick up cigarettes and you know, 
stuff for the troops there, you know?  I enjoyed it.  We had prisoners of war working for us.  The 
first were the Italians, then the Germans.  
Wife:  Germans.  Germans [few words unclear], Italia too.  
J:  After, yeah, they let the Italians go.  Yeah.  
T:  And then you all were saying the other day that you all had big parties while you were there?  
Were you just joking?
J:  Oh yeah, yeah, sure!  I mean uh, hey why not.  The war was over and everything like that. 
(Wife:  Yeah)  And we'd get together and with, they hire what do you call it, (Wife:  unclear) a 
whole like a restaurant or something like that.  The Captain would make sure that [Wife:  
unclear], yeah, yeah, yeah.  
Wife:  You know Brook, what's the name, Brook?  
J:  Brook, yeah.  (Wife:  The one in Massachusetts)  Senator, was it Senator Brook?  (T:  Brooks, 
yeah)  Yeah.  Yeah, he was(--)
Wife:  He's in Rome.  He married (--)
J:  ...With his wife.  He married an Italian girl over there too.  And he was living down the street 
from us.  (T:  Oh really?)  Sure.
Wife:  They divorced now.  We see him in Rome at that time.  And we knew him.
J:  Son of a gun.  (T:  Is that right!)  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, he use to say, "Hi Captain," hi this.  He 
used to come in the PX, you know?  
Wife:  We knew him.  He live on the end of the street.  He married an Italia woman.  Now him 
divorced.  He got a daughter.  Divorced again.  [Comment unclear].  
J:  Yeah, Senator Brook.  I remember that.  Yeah.

Wife:  And this one, him [unclear] with the other, maybe six or so you know, with a gun, you 
know, Memorial Day?  (T:  Right)  
J:  At attention.
Wife:  The choir.  The [unclear] choir.  (J:  With the music)  The little boy [comment unclear].  (J:
my son)  All six soldiers, nobody say one word.  Quiet.  Who's smiling?  President Eisenhower.  
(J:  Yeah, yeah)  He's smiling at him [unclear].  (J:  That was General Eisenhower then, yeah)  
[Comment unclear]  Him want to kill me.  [Comment unclear].
J:  Well you know, with the eyes.  Eyes straight ahead, you know, you stand in attention with a 
rifle in your hand.  You can't do nothing you know.  
Wife:  What's he going to do?  The kid don't (--)
J:  And all the people are spectators, they're all laughing, you know?  They got a boot out of it, 
you know?  But my face was just about as red as it is now maybe.  (Wife:  unclear)  My, my wife
called him, "kid, come on, come on, come on, come on.  Andy, Andrew, come on, come on."  
Finally he left, you know.  I'll never forget that day.  That was quite a (--)
Wife:  It was a beautiful day.  You know he got a lot of American women soldiers, [rest of 
comment unclear].  You got a lot of Officials too.  (J:  Oh yeah)  The name Captain, the General. 
A big day in Rome.  Big.  Big in Rome.  Memorial Day you got a beautiful, beautiful day.  That's
it.  I enjoy it.  I tell you the truth I enjoy my husband in the army.  I enjoy it.
J:  Yup, I enjoy it too, until like I say, they signed that ratification.  I come back here to the states.
I was disappointed, because where did they throw me?  Of all things, infantry.  (T:  Umhm)  And 
to toughen me up they threw me into Fort Brag.  (T:  Right)  You know?  From Fort Devens I had
to report to Fort Devens over here again.  And from Fort Devens they sent me to Fort Brag, 
because I think at that time they knew there was going to be something going on with Korea.  
Because the way they went me there and they were pushing us.  Then they sent me to Fort Benny
for more training, you know, basic training.  Not basic training.  I went through all that bologna.  
I was a rifle man anyway.  But I mean we're going out all week long, from Monday till Saturday. 
And Saturday we'd just clean up, get our rifles cleaned and everything like that.  They give us 
Saturday afternoon, Sunday, and out in the field we went.  Well I got out let's see, January 22nd.  
I'll never forget that.  No, 21st, 22nd?  1949.  (Wife:  yeah)  Yeah.  And my whole company went 
to Korea.  So I was fortunate enough that they they were begging me to stay.  You know, they 
knew something was going on.  We were going out on the field every week.  I said, the hell with 
this.  I got to take care of my wife.  I wasn't making enough money to send over there to take 
care of her and the kid.  
T:  She was still in Italy?
J:  She was still in Italy.  I couldn't you know, bring her over here and what?  (Wife: and we don't
know what happened)  She uh, she couldn't even speak a few words in english.  Just Joe, shut up,
and you know, go to bed, or something like that.  (T:  [laughs] , right)  
Wife:  No, he know why.  We don't know what happened to him.  It's better to stay in Italy.  
J:  Yeah, better I, better to keep her where she was safe, you know?  I didn't want her traveling 
around camp to camp like I seen some of the GI's that has their wives you know, and the kids 
going from here to there.  They couldn't make out on that.  (T:  Right)  So they had to get some 
kind of jobs for wives on the side here.  Either bar maids or something like that.  [Unclear]
T:  Right.
Wife:  Now, wait a minute.  (J:  Go ahead, I wouldn't...)  19 [rest of comment unclear]
T:  1950.
Wife:  50.  My husband want to take me to America.  Italy don't leave me go.  [Comment 
unclear]  Do you understand me?  (T:  Umhm, umhm)  I got to come to America.  Asked me the 
paper married.  Me, I married in the army, with the army.  I got married again.  (T:  You had to 
marry again?)  Italia way.  All right?  I got married again to make everything to my children, to 
myself, to make everything all set that I married in the church and everything.  (T:  Right)  While
him come back in Italy and we marry.  
J:  Well you got to remember Lina too, I didn't bring you over here until I got out of the army 
right away, because I had no place to put you.  My sister was here next door in this apartment.  
(Wife:  Yes, that's [unclear])  And I didn't have no money in my pocket.
Wife:  Now listen.  [Chuckles]
T:  So you went back to Italy to get married again?
J:  Well marry, not to marry, but to go to the American Consulate over there and fix all the papers
up.   (Wife:  Yeah)  I had to get all the papers straightened out and everything like that.  I figured 
she was going to come right over with me, you know, back with me.  I had just enough of money
to bring her back with me.  But no way, at that time they were really strict.  He says, oh no, no.  
She's go to file for other papers.  I says, "hey, she's my wife and everything.  You've seen the 
documents and everything."  He says, "no, no, no, no.  She got to make out different papers.  It's 
going to take awhile."  I says, "how long?"  He said, "I don't know.  Not too long.  Maybe a 
couple of months or so, and she'll be over there with you."  I said, "well that's fine, if it's only a 
couple of months", you know?   One, two months, three months go by, four, five months.  
Wife:  Right.  Yeah, that's (--)  We marry.  Okay, we marry.  And we go to honeymoon.  And we 
go to [unclear] me and my husband, and take my brother.  After we come back from [unclear], 
my husband come in America, and left it to me to make all the paper to go back.  Now my 
husband say, "we'll leave the kid in here, this way he go to Italia school."  Good thing we did.  
Now him got another language to teach.  And we left the kid in Italy.
J:  Why don't you tell him the truth!  We didn't have enough money in the first place.  We had to 
make out first for ourselves.  
Wife:  First, I'm coming over there I'm going to work right away.  I'm going to work.  Even I 
wanted to work.  [Unclear]  I don't know a job.  I don't know, needle I never seen in my life.  
Needle, never.  Coming [unclear].  He rented this apartment my husband.  
J:  Yeah, next to my sister right here.    
Wife:  No got anything.  We no got anything, just one bed.  The first thing we buy the frigidaire.  
(J:  And a stove)  And the stove.
J:  No, the frigidaire come later, remember?  
Wife:  Yeah.  We got a stove before we buy frigidaire.  I work in the mill.
T:  You worked in, which mill did you work in?
Wife:  [Name of mill unclear]
J:  [Repeats name of mill, unclear]
Wife:  I worked over there.  Started off with [unclear].
T:  And what did you do?
Wife:  Wind.
J:  A winder.  
Wife:  I worked, I come home.  My husband work night shift.  I worked 2-10.  And you don't 
know how much I cry. 
J:  And sometimes you worked on Saturday, remember?
Wife:  Yeah, I worked on Saturday.
J:  Tell him how much money you made that, that time a week.  How much money did you bring 
home to me.
Wife:  Maybe thirty dollars?
J:  That was when you had a good week.  When you worked Saturday, time and a half.
T:  Really?
Wife:  Yeah.
J:  Thirty bucks.
T:  Let me move this over here.  [Must have moved dishes out of the way]
Wife:  I started working.  After I started feeling for the kid, the boy, you know?  Oh jeese, I 
wanted the boy.
J:  Yeah, I also thought that you know, it was straightened out.
Wife:  We sign, we signed to leave the kid.  Remember over there we signed to leave the kid?  (J:
Yup)  We signed, we say, leave the kid.  And we got a lot of trouble to bring the kid over here.  
J:  Yeah, after that.  (T:  Oh really?)  She could have brought him over at first, you know, with 
her.  (T:  Right, but then to get it back)  But after we started you know, trying to make the papers 
off of him to bring it over here, for cripes sake there!  The government was so strict and 
everything with the kid, it wasn't funny.  I had to go and beg either (tape fades out).
