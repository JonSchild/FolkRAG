Words and Music by W ILL S. 
HAYS. 
As sung by Gus -W ILLIAMS. 
The Music of this Song is published by I. L. PgTERS, New York. 
Price 33 cents. 
Y011'VA no doubt heard the song. 
Of 
Father dear, come home," 
And the fate of hungry little Ben, 
Who sent for him to come; 
how the old man used to " smile," 
And cause the family pain, 
But he let up for a 
little while, 
And then got drunk again. 
CHORUS. 
We've given him up for gone. 
He'S lying in the lane, 
And almost every body knows, 
The old man's drunk again. 
He takes his. morning nip, 
And loafs about the door; 
He told his family more than once, 
That he would drink no more ;. 
But then he would forget 
From 
benzine" to abstain, 
The police, they would come and say. 
"The old man's drunk again." 
We've given him up for gone, ike. 
He'd smash poor mother's nose, 
And upset brother Ned, 
And drive us all into the street, 
Then tumble irno bed ; 
And when he'd be asleep, 
We'd go back and remain, 
Until he woke and lett the house, 
To come home drunk again. 
We've given him up for gone, tte. 
" 
0 ! Father, dear, come home," 
Stop drinking like a 
sow ; 
You've drank away the beds and stove, 
Don't swallow up the cow ; 
0! don't abuse the boys, 
And cause poor mother pain, 
Or we'll rebel and " go for you," 
When you get drunk again. 
,We've given him up for gone, ttc.

Won't you tell me, Mollie darling, 
That you love none else but me, 
For I 
love you, Mollie darling, 
You are all the world to me. 
0! tell me, darling, that you love me, 
Put your little hand in mine, 
Take my heart; sweet Mollie darling, 
Say that you will give me thine. 
CHORUS. 
Mollie, fairest, sweetest, dearest, 
Look up, darling, tell me this; 
Do you love me, Mollie darling, 
Let your answer be a 
kiss. 
Stars are smiling, Mollie darling, 
Thro' the mystic veil of night; 
They seem laughing, Mollie darling., 
While fair Luna hides her light. 
0! no one listens but the flowers, 
While they hang their heads in shame, 
They are modest, Mollie darling, 
When they hear me call your name. 
Mollie, fairest, tte. 
I 
must leave you, Mollie darling, 
Tito' the parting gives me pain ; 
When the stars shine, Mollie darling, 
I 
will meet you here again. 
0! good- night, Mollie, good-bye, loved one, 
happy may you ever be, 
When you're dreaming, Mollie darling, 
Don't forget to dream of me. 
Mollie, fairest. Ii5a.

Lookup, darting, tell me that 
You still love me, Molly darling, 
Don't despise me 'cause I'm lat.

We'll have lots of Dolly Vardens, 
Playing tag around the house ; 
You must give thew paregoric, 
Put them in their little bed, 
Should they annoy you, Molly darling, 
Gently put nn them a 
head. 
Roily, fattitst• Le.

-DON'T -GO, MOLLIE DARLING. 
Words by FRANK DUMONT. 
Music by J. HENRY W HITMORII. 
Oh! Mollie, darling, the anchor is weighed, 
The ship is now ready to sail o'er the sea, 
Each moment is precious and time will not wait, 
Oh! Mollie my treasure do listen to me; 
You're going far away from kindred and friends, 
011 to the land that is far o'er the foam, 
We've no one but you to gladden our hearts— 
Don't leave us, Mollie, sweet light of our home. 
CHORUS. 
Don't cross the sea, Mollie, and leave us alone, 
For dreary our beautiful home then will be. 
We've no one to care for but you, Mollie dear, 
Don't leave us, darling. Oh I 
listen to we. 
Oh !
Molliô, my darling, your father is ill, 
But still he has come down to see you depart. 
He stands by your side in our sorrow and pain, 
And tears tell the anguish that lies in his heart, 
Oh I 
come to my arms, let me fold you again, 
Close to the heart that is throbbing for thee, 
Remember the days when I 
sang you to sleep, 
Don't leave us, Mollie, to cross the blue sea. 
Don't cross the sea, Mollie, Sze. 
Oh! Mollie, my darling, say what will you do, 
Alone in a 
land were but strangers abide, 
No kind words you'll hear ot advice, Medic dear, 
But au I- many evils will lurk at your side; 
Let me kiss you, perhaps for the last time on earth, 
For we are old, and our days are but few, 
There's tears in your eyes, I 
see you'll not go— 
Heav'n pour sweet blessings, dear Mollie, on you. 
Don't cross the sea, Mollie, &c.

THE BARD OP ARMAGH. 
As sung by NED H ARRIGAN. 
0 t 
list to the lay of a 
poor Irish harper, 
And scorn not the strains of his old withered hands, 
But, remember those fingers, they once could move sharper, 
In raising the merry strains to his dear native land, 
It was long before the shamrock, dear isle, lovely emblem, 
Was crushed in its beauty, by the Saxon's lion paw, 
And all the pretty colleens around me would gather 
Call me their bold Phelim Brady, the Bard of Armagh. 
How I 
love to muse on the days of my boyhood, 
Though four score and three years have flew by them, 
It's king's sweet reflection that every young joy, 
For the merry-hearted boys make the best of old men. 
At a 
fair, or a 
wake I 
could twist my shillelah, 
And trip through a 
dance wid my brogues tied with straw, 
There all the pretty maidens around me would gather, 
Call me their bold Phelim Brady, the Bard of Armagh. 
In truth I 
have wandered this wide world all over, 
Yet Ireland's my home and a 
dweLing for me, 
And oh, let the turf that my old bones shall cover, 
Be. cut from the land that is trod by the free; 
And when serjeant death in his cold arms doth embrace. 
And lull me to sleep with old Erin-go-bragh, 
By the side of my Kathleen, my dear pride, oh place me, 
Then forget l'helim Bra.9y, the Bardof Armagh.

Half hid her face in shadow; 
Bat when e'er I

They shone like diamonds there; 
She's as pretty as a

And you never miss the sun whenever she is near you I 
If you saw her you'd adore her, 
She's as pretty as a

Oh my dm.,

When ' twas time to go we talked so slow, 
The roses scarce could hear us, 
Then my heart in sport ' twas cupid caught, 
Like fishes near the shore ; 
When I 
told her so as I 
turned to go, 
She fondly lingered near me, 
And she drooped her bead and sweetly said— 
I 
wish you " au revoir," 
She's as pretty as a 
picture ! 
And my heart's a 
golden 
She's a 
fairy blithe and airy,

The rain poured down alarmingly, 
When to a 
tree we came, 
And shelter took beneath it, 
There I 
quickly learned her name. 
She also told me where she lived, 
With pa down at the farm; 
A 
farmer's daughter I

That is an extra charm.

THE KISS BEHIND THE DOOR. 
OR, WHERE'S ROSANNA GONE? 
Sung With Greatest Success by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
By G. W HUNT. 
0 
once I 
was as gay 
As a 
jolly young cock sparrow, 
Who's perch'd upon an apple tree, 
Or down amongst the corn. 
But now clean through my heart 
You could drive a 
large wheel barrow, 
For my love has left a 
hole in it. 
0 
where's Rosanna gone. 
I 
shall never kiss my love again behind the kitchen door, 
I 
shall never squeedge my darling's little finger any more. 
And she'll ne'er pinch my funny-bone until it's rather sore, 
Oh where's Rosanna gone. 
I'm sure no other maid 
Could equal my Rosanna, 
Without my love this manly form 
Will soon became a 
wreck; 
Of her Dad I 
was afraid, 
lie's a 
disagreeable tanner, 
And he's often promised faithfully 
He'd dislocate my neck. 
So I 
used to kiss Rosanna just behind the kitchen door.

THE KISS BEHIND THE DOOR.--[CoNetuem 
Of an evening after tea, 
While her Daddy blew his `bacca,' 
I'd seek my love Rosanna, and 
Ask her to share my lot. 
But when he found it out, 
Oh my how he would whack her, 
While I'd jump over the garden wall, 
As tho' I'd just been shot. 
I 
shall never kiss my love, &a. 
I'd jumped over the wall one night, 
In search of sweet Rosanna, 
And tho' I 
gently whistled, 
My love did not appear; 
But my hair stood bolt upright, 
For out came her dad the tanner, 
Oh I 
my teeth they rattled like dominoes, 
And my legs doubled up with fear. 
Spoken—At the end, of our interview I 
felt convinced that he 
understood what ' tanning' was, and so did I. 
I 
also concluded. 
I 
should never see my love, 
Some say she's hid away, 
By her cruel Dad on purpose, 
To cure her of her love for me. 
Some say my love's no more. 
If she's defunct, then soon 
Shall they find my clay cold corpus, 
And our ghosts shall come and frighten Ler Dad 
Behind the kitchen door. 
So I 
used to kiss Rosanna just behind the kitchen door, 
But I 
ne'er shall squeedge my darling's little finger any more 
And she'll ne'er pinch my funny-bone, until it's rather sore, 
0 
where's Rosanna gone ?

It; 
YOU'LL HEAR NO NOISE. 
Sung by SHERIDAN and M ACK. 
Here we are, two merry boys, 
Full of life and tun, 
Singing, dancing every night, 
When our work is done ; 
The people everywhere we go, 
Call us their favorite boys, 
And when we sing and dance for them, 
We never make a 
noise. 
CHORUS. 
Just watch the way we throw our feet. [sym.] 
Our dancing is so very neat, wild 
Oh, how we love to sing and dance, 
'Tis one of life's best joys, 
You can see our feet move up and down, 
But you'll never hear a 
noise. 
To balls and parties we do go, 
And with the ladies flirt, 
Oh, ain't they nice young fellows, 
The girls II icy all assert ; 
The other gems get jealous 
And say we're fast young boys, 
They envy us because we sing 
And dance without a 
noise. 
Just watch the way, &c. 
I 
think there's some one calling us, 
So kind friends we must go 
We're sorry we must leave, 
But we've other work to do ; 
When you come some other time, 
You'll always find us boys, 
Ready to sing and dance for you, 
But you'll never hear a 
noise. 
Just watch the way, & c. 
DUTCH SONG AND DANCE. 
Ant:—"I 
love you." 
While valking in dot garten, 
Viewing pretty flowers, 
Den I 
valked around dot fountin, 
A looking at dem showers, 
It was thare I 
met a 
deitcher, 
Who sweedly said to we, 
Like one voice from heaven, 
Oh, Jakey, do you love Inc. 
CHORUS. 
Yes, yes, yes, I 
do love thee, 
And if you were my little wife, 
How happy I 
would be, 
I 
tink I 
hear dot music, 
A whispering sweedly, 
Or the voice of dot little deitcher, 
Who said do you love me. 
I 
sat down by her side, 
Enchanted by her view, 
For I 
was completely love struck, 
I 
would now, wouldn't you, 
I 
sat thar like a 
statue, 
A whispering like a 
bumble bee, 
When I 
heard her sweet voice saying, 
On, Jokey, do you love me. 
Yes, yes, yes. &c. 
I 
told her that I 
loved her, 
More than any von, 
Ven she told me, said she only said it,, 
For to raise it little fun, 
0 
den I 
got my mad up, 
And vent home don't you see, 
Yen I 
heard her sweet voice saying, 
Oh, Jokey, do you love nhe 
Yes, yes, yes, sioc,

To what I 
hear about the town 
I 
give my close attention; 
The sayings that I 
hear about, 
To you I 
often mention. 
How great the rage for by- wards now, 
It couldn't well be greater, 
But the latest ore ilat's come out is, 
Good-bye— I'll see you later. 
Tech little boy upon the street, 
Of men an imitator, 
Will holler to a 
boy he'll meet, 
Good-bye- 1'11 see you later. 
The other evening out I 
walked, 
My leisure time beguiling, 
When into a 
saloon I 
dropped, 
And found the boys a " smiling." 
" 
Come, Toi.y, j'in us, have a 
drink r 
Cried one wild dissipator. 
Says I, " Youl1 just excuse me now, 
Good-bye— Ill see you later." 
They held me fast. 
I 
had to drink 
Till my spirits grew elator, 
And very soon I 
staggered out, 
With " Good-bye— I'll see you later.' 
A pretty girl I 
met, her eyes 
A 
glance of love shot through me, 
And soon for supper we were bound, 
I 
thought, of course, she knew me. 
She drank so much, it really seemed 
'Iwould soon intoxicate her; 
Thinks I 
she'll break my pocket-book 
Before it gels melt later. 
To my dismay I 
caught her soon, 
A-winking at the waiter, 
Saying, " B 
ere's a 
fiat !" Says I, " Enough) 
Good-bye— I'll see you later." 
They called on me to pay the bill, 
Which I'd no inclination, 
A policeman, then, they soon brought in 
To take me to the station; 
He called me, saying, " Come along, 
My swindling operator, 
And soon I'll have you in a 
cell, 
Then, good-bye-- I'll see you later." 
But I 
tripped him up, and off I 
went 
As .swift as any skater, 
And to the peeler hollered out, 
" 
Good-bye— I'll see you later." 
I 
wandered home, and there my wife 
Commenced a 
curtain lecture, 
Says she, a 
nice hour you've come home, 
And what a 
looking picture. 
Of course I 
didn't have the heart 
To scold or irritate her, 
So says I. " Old woman, go to sleep, 
Good-bye- 111 see you later." 
So now ill finish up my song, 
To you I've come to cater, 
And U 
I've gained your kind applauae, 
Good- bye—H1 see you later.

TOOR.AL-OORA.L-OORAL LEE.—[COED] 
A 
feeling of anger o'or me spread, 
I 
threatened to punch young Tooral's head; 
Then Sally's face got awfully red, 
When I 
asked her which of the two she'd wed; 
She up and, said, I 
was misted, 
And was very ill-bred, on her heart to tread, 
That she couldn't conceive why I 
thought she'd deceive, 
That she'd very much grieve, if I'd disbelieve 
In her love, for she was certain that we 
Would always agree, and said that she 
Would sooner have me than Tooral-ooral-ooral Lee, 
Than Tooral-ooral-i-doe. 
So as on marriage we were bent, 
Why Sally and Ito the altar went, 
Though I'm sorry she ever did give her Cnr*fint, 
But the crime has carried the punishment-; 
For she's not content, that's evident, 
And I 
often lament that I 
underwent 
The experiment, for she's violent 
To such a 
degree, 'cos I 
could see, 
That Tooral Lee, was much too free; 
And between you and me, I 
think that sho 
Is rather fond of Tooral-ooral-ooral Lee, 
Of Tooral-ooral-i-doe. 
And therefore, as a 
last resource, 
I'm going to try and get a 
divorce, 
I 
find that'll be the easiest course, 
And I'll do it without the least remorse. 
For ye know, of course, I 
can't be worse, 
I'd best be a 
horse, or a 
bloated corse, 
Than allow she and Tooral Lee, 
To treat poor me as if I 
were a 
flea; 
But I 
hope with glee the day to see, 
When sorry she'll be she discarded me, 
Because she wanted Tooral-ooral-ooral Lee 
For Tooral-ooral-i-doe.

THE HAPPIEST DARKIES OUT. 
We've just arrived in town to-night, 
Our story for to tell, 
We don't care much if we ain't white, 
Our color suits us well ; 
We practice on the heel and toe, 
And then we sing and shout, 
We're always welcome where we go, 
We're the happiest darkies out. 
CHORUS. 
Just watch the movements of the shin 
We kick dull care about, 
And always wear a 
jolly grin, 
Thc happiest dailies out. 
When our plantation work is done, 
We go upon a 
spree. 
To have a 
little sport and fun, 
Our hearts chock full of glee; 
Let politicians lave and blow, 
Let everybody shout, 
We care for neither friend nor foe, 
We're the happiest darkies out. 
Just watch, ecc. 
We both support double-breasted heels, 
Which brings us lots of cash, 
We both love ' Utters and fried eels, 
And don't go back on hash; 
And thus we pass each night and day, 
Take dull care by the snout, 
Awl make him scoot some other way, 
From the happiest darkies out. 
Just watch, Scc. 
We go to a 
fancy colored ball, 
And dance a 
jig or reel, 
We fascinate the wenches all, 
By the movement o( the heel. 
They think we are aristocrats 
From Fifth Avenue no doubt— 
"But no." we cry, " that's all my eye," 
We're the happiest darkies out. 
Just watch, doc.

We're as happy, just as happy as can be, 
We're full of fun, my little Sue and me, 
We ran away from school to-day, 
And oh, we had such fun: 
Playing hookey from the school, 
I 
know is against the rule, 
But we don't care, when we got there, 
The school it was begun.

First we went and got some cherries in the rood, 
And

And then we went down to the pond, 
And with the ducks did play;

THE OLD HOME AIN'T WHAT IT USED TO B. 
Oh, the old home ain't what it used to be, 
The banjo and the fiddle has gone, 
And no more you hear the darkies singing, 
Among the sugar cane and corn ; 
Great changes has come to the poor colored man, 
But this change makes him sad and forlorn. 
For no more we hear the darkies singing 
Among the sugar cane and corn. 
CHORUS. 
No, the old home ain't what it used to be, 
The change makes me sad and forlorn, 
For no more we hear the dailies singing 
Among the sugar cane and corn. 
In the field I've worked when I 
thought 'twas hard, 
But night bro't its pleasure and rest, 
In the old house down by the river side. 
The place of all the world the best. 
Oh, where are the children that once used to play 
In the lane by the old cabin door, 
Tney are scattered now and o'er the world they roam, 
The old man ne'er will see them more. 
No, the old home, &c. 
Now the old man would rather lived and died 
In the home where his children were born, 
But when freedom came to the colored man, 
left his cotton-field and corn. 
This old man has lived out his three-score and ten, 
And he'll soon have to lay down and die, 
Yet he hopes to go into a 
better land, 
So now, old cabin home, good-bye. 
No, the old home, &c.

MAN IS BUT A PIPE AND HIS LIFE IS BUT 
SMOKE. 
Contented I 
sit with my pipe and my glass, 
Puffing sorrow and care tar away, 
Though liquor may banish man's reason afar, 
He's only a 
fool or a 
sot, 
While his sense and his reason are always at war. 
lie don't know when enough. he has got. 
CHORUS. 
Though many may laugh, others may joke, 
Man's but a 
pipe and his life is but smoke. 
Now man and a 
pipe are much nearer to kin, 
Than ever you have understood, 
For until with breath they are both filled within, 
Pray tell me for what are tbey good; 
For the one and the other's composed of clay, 
And if right I 
tell nature's plan, 
It takes but the breath from them both right away. 
The pipe dies and so cloth the man. 
Though many may, & c. 
Now I'm told by my pipe man's lot is to die, 
For sooner or later he must, 
And when to the end of life's journey he's got, 
Like a 
pipe that's smoked out he's but dust; 
Then all you that wish in your hearts to be gay, 
Encourage not grief, strife 
or sorrow, 
Make much of your pipe of tobacco to-day. 
For you may be smoked out on the morrow. 
Though many may, &e.

ON THE PARADE.—[CoNcLummi 
Now some like the jettys, 
And some like the piers, 
Infested by nurse-maids, 
And infants—" sweet dears"— 
And some climb the heights, 
But as I 
am afraid 
Of too much exertion 
I 
keep the Parade. 
Spoken.—If a 
fella goes up a 
bill, be has to come down again 
some time or other. 
If a 
fella does the Beach, it's all " now for 
rowing," or " now for sailing," " fresh baked shrimps," and " fresh 
boiled buns," and such like confounded bores so I 
keep— 
On the Parade, &c. 
Now some like the sands, 
Some rude fellas there be, 
Who quiz the fair charmers, 
Who bathe in the sea. 
Some " go in" for sailing, 
But of that I'm afraid; 
I 
feel so much safer 
When on the Parade. 
Spoken.—A" sail in a 
pleasure-boat," pleasure—oh, excuse me 
when a 
fella's on shore he knows where he is, but when a 
fella's 
in a 
pleasure (?) boat, he don't know where he is, and feels as if 
he didn't care where he went to; so I 
feel more " at home— 
On the Parade, &c. 
'Tis upon the Parade, 
When the sun's going down, 
One meets with the fairest 
Elite of the town. 
There's one charmer I'd " pop " to, 
But feel most afraid, 
She's the fairest and richest 
Upon the Parade. 
Spoken.—Beautiful creature! daughter of an Indian banker— 
nandsome girl—with an ugly old governor—the old buffer has a 
gambooge complexion, and a 
voice like a 
cracked trombone—does 
the Bath chair- business. Should" the gods smile upon my" wooing, 
by Jove, I'll live and die— 
On the Parade, ctc.

B= YOUR STAMPS ON US. _ 
By SHERIDAN and M ACE. 
There's some folks borrow trouble, 
And then they feel so blue, 
They go and throw themselves away, 
And don't, know what to do ; 
But we're a 
happy couple, 
Who don't make any fuss, 
And in this little song and dance, 
You can bet your stamps on us. 
CHORUS. 
Now don't you be a 
fool, 
But always take things cool, 
Jump 'round, break down, 
Twist your ankle thus, 
Don't you ever be afraid. 
To bet your stamps on us. 
There are some folks kind of airy, 
Who blow and talk quite loud, 
They would not notice common folks, 
They are so very proud ; 
But let them blow and put on airs, 
You needn't care a 
cuss, 
For whether school it keeps or not, 
You can bet your stamps on us. 
Now don't you, 86e. 
To keep out of double trouble, 
As through this world you roam, 
Don't let trifles worry you, 
But take things as they come; 
Go right in, through thick and thin, 
If you get in any muss, 
Just drop a 
line and every time, 
You can bet your stamps on us. 
Now don't you, ecc.

BOYHOOD'S YEARS. 
Au ! 
why should I 
recall them— the gay, the joyous years, 
Ere hope was cross'd or pleasure dinim'd by sorrow and 
by tears ? 
Or why should mem'ry love to trace youth's glad and 
sunlit way, 
When those who made its charms so sweet are gathered to 
decay 
The summer's sun shall come again to brighted bill and 
bower— 
The teeming earth its fragrance bring beneath the balmy 
shower; 
But all in vain will mem'ry strive, in vain we shed our 
tears— 
They're gone away and can't return—the friends of boy-
hood's years! 
Ah ! why then wake my sorrow, and bid me ncw count 
o'er 
The vanished friends so dearly prized—the days to come 
no more— 
, 
The happy days of infancy, when no guile our bosoms 
knew, 
Nor reeled we of the pleasures that with each moment 
flew ? 
'Tis all in vain to weep for them—the past a dream 
appears; 
And where are they—the lov'd, the young, the friends of 
boyhood's years ? 
Go seek them in the cold church-yard—they long have 
stolen to rest ; 
But do not weep, for their young cheeks by woe were 
ne'er oppressed : 
Life's sun for them in splendour set—no cloud came o'er 
time ray 
That lit them from this gloomy world upon their joyous 
way. 
No tears about their graves be shed—but sweetest flow'rs 
be flung— 
The fittest ofrring thou =1st make to hearts that perish 
young— 
To hearts this world has never torn with racking hopes 
and fears; 
For bless'd are they who pass away in boyhood's happy 
years.

BIG A ND THE LITTLE OF IT' 
By HARRIGAN and HART. 
First Lover. 
I've just arrived in town to-day, 
To see the girl I 
love ; 
She lives in yonder little Cot, 
She is my turtle dove. 
I 
know I've got a 
rival, 
That comes here on the sly; 
I'm bound to have the girl you bet, 
At least I'm going to try. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, my. the girl she must be mine, 
With her Grecian bend stuck out behind: 
I'm bound to have the girl you know, 
The fairest in the land; 
And I 
never will be satisfied, 
Until I 
take her hand. 
Second Lover. 
wonder who that feller was, 
lie thinks he cuts a 
shine 
He comes around the girl I 
lova, 
And very soon I'll find. 
He'd better quickly take a 
walk, 
On him I'll put a 
head ; 
And send him home with his Ma, 
She'll put him right in bed. 
Oh, my, the girl, &a 
Both. 
Ob, what's the matter ! excuse me, sir. 
What was you doing here! 
Second Lover; 
I 
came to court the girl I 
love, 
Now don't you interfere. 
First Lover. 
I'd interfere, just if I 
like, 
For you was now on time: 
Second Lover-
I 
reckon not if I 
know myself, 
She promised to be mine. 
Oh, my, the girl, &-tr. 
"HAPPY OLD MAN; 
'Oh, young folks, how do you do? 
You're all looking quite well ; 
lsuppose you don't know me. 
Well, my liame is Grandiather Ben, 
About sixty years ago, 
I 
was young and happy then ; 
But I'm told I 
m 
getting old, 
So pity Grandfather Ben. 
CHORUS. 
Fal de dal du ral da, 
Fat de dal du ral da, 
Fal de dal, fal de did, 
Pal de dal du ral da. 
in the days when I 
was young, 
Of civility one was sure; 
But now as you walk the street, 
You're either a 
guy or a 
cure. 
The other day some smart young chap, 
I 
think it was on Monday 
Says, see here, Old Cauliflower, 
Oh, where are you going next Sunday ? 
CHORUS.— It's the truth now, what 1 
say, 
The boys that you may meet. 
They're sure to shout, when you walk out, 
Hi! Governor, how's your poor old feet? 
So now I've had my say, 
I'll just begin to toddle, 
About sixty years ago 
I 
could run instead of waddle. 
But I'm glad to see you here, 
Whenever I've the chance; 
So now I'll bid you all good-bye, 
And off at once rit dance. 
CHORUS— No wonder you may laugh, 
When I 
say off 
dance ; 
There was a 
time when I 
could, 
But now the rheumatics won't give me a 
chance.

THE BOWERY GIRLS.--1CoscLuDED.] 
The Bowery girls, the Bowery girls, 
Make good wives when they marry, 
They ease man's life of care and strife. 
And make it one of joy. 
It's very well for folks to tell 
About our country beauties, 
They can't surpass the Bowery lass . 
In their domestic duties) 
Oh! the Bowery- 
girls, di•c. 
When husbands roam away from home, 
Say to their " club" they're going, 
Though he, they know, does elsewhere go, 
They never say one word. 
They're martyrs quite, sit up at night, 
His shirts and stockings mending, 
His garments turn, a 
penny earn, 
While he's a 
shilling spending! 
Oh! the Bowery girls, &c. 
It is their plan to comfort man 
And make his fireside cheerful, 
No undarned hose he ever knows, 
Nor shirts from buttons free. 
And if at night he goes home " tight," 
Then next day wakes up yawning, 
They for his sake get up and make 
His breakfast in the morning. 
Oh! the Bowery girls, &c. 
The Bowery girls, the Bowery girls 
Are all domesticated; 
They bake, they brew, the washing do, 
And toil from day to night. 
Throughout their lives, the best of wives 
They make man, beyond measure; 
The Bowery girls are priceless pearls, 
Each one's a 
perfect treasure I 
Oh! the Bowery girls, &c.

I've been waiting for more than an hour, love, 
Yes waiting and watching for thee, 
While hoping and praying you'd come, love, 
And keep true your promise to me ; 
For you told me you'd meet me this ev'ning, 
And listen to what I've to say, 
Tho' to speak the plain truth I 
am certain, 
I 
can't tell you all in a 
day. 
By the lilies that float down the river, 
By the cowslips that grow on the lea, 
By the roses that bloom in the forest, 
I'm waiting fair lady for thee. 
CHORUS. 
I'm waiting, yes waiting, I'm waiting my darling for thee, 
I'm waiting, yes waiting, I'm waiting my darling for thee. 
For more than a 
year I 
have waited, 
That promise from you to receive, 
So surely you'll not break your word love, 
Nor leave me your absence to grieve; 
So I'll wait and still watch here yet longer, 
In hope of your coming this way, 
When the dim misty veil of the twilight, 
liath shut out the brightness of day. 
By the lines that float down the river, 
By the cowslips that grow on the lea, 
By the roses that bloom in the forest, 
I'm waiting fair lady for thee. 
I'm waiting, &c.

SQUINTY DAN, 
[BANJO SOLO.] 
211 tell you of a 
nice young man, 
And of a 
maiden gal ; 
The neighbors called him Squinty Dan, 
And she long-legged Sal. 
They lived down on Centre Street, 
And loved each other well; 
And it's of a 
dismal history, 
That now I'm going to tell. 
:Nov Squinty Dan he had red hair, 
And looked two ways for Monday; 
He peddled clams around the street, 
On every day but Sunday. 
But Sundays Squinty Dan would go 
To court long-legged Sal, 
And take her to ride in his clam-barouche 
On the banks of Gowanus canal. 
He used to feed her on clam-soup, 
Clam-chowder, and clam- pie, 
And send her lots of long-necked clams, 
For her to roast and fry. 
Till the neighbors' gals, through jealousy, 
Male up a 
horrid plan 
To freeze the love in the bosom of 
Her darling Squinty Dan, 
When Squiry Dan heard the news, 
He climbed to a 
chimney-top; 
He pulled a 
pound of powder our, 
And down he let it drop. 
It flashed up with a 
fearful roar, 
And Wowed him so far on high ; 
He never came down—and that is the lass 
Of ,this mournful his-to-ry.

GIRL WITH THE FLOWING HAIR, 
Original. H ARRIGAN and HART. 
My thoughts of a 
girl I 
can't conceal, / 
I 
met the other day, 
She'd a 
dainty loot and a 
lovely heel, 
With, oh, such a winning way; 
No duck in a 
pond was half so light, 
As she with her careless air, 
The veil she wore was scarlet bright, 
The girl with the flowing hair. 
CHORUS. 
Oh ! my heart went pit-pat as she passed me by, 
So beautiful and fair, 
She glanced at me with her soft blue eye, 
The girl with the flowing hair. 
We met again, 'twas in a 
set, 
At the colored waiter's ball, 
As I 
balanced across her eye I 
met, 
I 
really thought I'd fall; 
The music stopped, 1 
stepped aside 
To let her pass with care, 
To speak to her I 
really tried, 
The girl with the flowing hair. 
Oh! my heart &e. 
Oh what is the use of feeling sad, 
When there's lots of pretty girls 
In this town yet to be had, 
With plenty of silks and curls, 
But she's the only one I 
love, 
I'd tell her if I 
dare, 
She's sweet to me as the turtle dove, 
The girl with the flowing hair. 
Oh! my heart. iSoc.

scot and lot, 
For 
that was old Pe - ter's 
way. 
Though Peter was handsome, he never would wed, 
Yet the ladies he loved passing well; 
And the reason he gave was of all the dear sex, 
Which he loved best he never could tell. 
The Pollys, the Sallys, the Aunies, the Fans, 
So smothered poor Peter's soft heart; 
A 
bachelor free he resolved to be, 
And never in wedlock take part. 
And he smoked his pipe and sang old song*, 
And merrily soaked his clay, 
And cheerfully paid his scot and lot, 
For that was old Peter's way. 
Old Peter jogged on in his usual way, 
And his pipe smoked with Reid's double stout; 
Till, driving one day, in his turn-out so gay, 
A 
sweet damsel upon him did pout. 
Her bonnie black eyes took him by surprise, 
He asked her if she'd be his wife; 
She smiling said, yes, and he gave her a 
kiss, 
And now they are settled for life. 
Still he smokes his pipe and sings old songs, 
And merrily soaks his clay; 
His children and wife loves more than life, 
For that is old Peter's way.

WALKING IN THE LAMPLIGECT. 
Alit:—" Walking in the Starlight." 
Sung by HARRIGAN and HART. 
He. 
Walking in der lamplight, some one by mine side, 
Und dat some one's arm mit mine vas hooked ; 
I

'Cause you know my heart already once vas tooked. 
Valking crossde gutters by de mittle of de street, 
Und all around dem steamboats by de dock : 
She eat so many doughnuts and didn't give inc any, 
When she set down on a 
stone so hard as rock. 
CHORUS. 
Oh ! yah, I

Oof I

She. 
Dare dat leetle deitcher goes out mit me to valk, 
He's got his feet so awful full of corns ; 
Und when he don't got sleepy, his eyes vas wide awake, 
I

He's filthier vas von Amsterdam, nod he vas a

his hair vas curly blue mit brown and red : 
Hod I

Oof I

Oh! yah, & c. 
Walking in de lamplight, yen de moon don't shine, 
Und de poleeses goes a

You can hold my umbrella yen do rain conies down so wet, 
Und do little stars don't try to get a

TAKE ME HOME. 
By RAYMOND. 
The Music A' 'Add Song is published by J. L. Bemis, New York. 
Price 30 cents, 
Take me home to the place where I 
first saw the light, 
To the sweet sunny South take me home, 
Where tIte snacking bird sung me to rest every night, 
Ah ! why was I 
tempted to roam. 
think with regret of the dear ones I 
left, 
Of the warm hearts that shelter'd me then, 
Of the wife and the dear ones of whom Pm bereft, 
And I 
sigh for the old place again. 
CHORUS. 
Take me home to the place where my little ones sleep, 
Poor massa lies buried close by, 
O'er the grave of the lov'd ones I 
long to weep, 
And among them to rest when I 
die. 
Take me home to the place where the orange trees grow, 
To my cot in the over green shade, 
Where the flowers on the river's green margin may blow, 
Their sweets on the bank where we played. 
The path to our cottage they say has grown green, 
And the place is quite lonely around ; 
And I 
know that the smiles and the forms I 
have seen, 
Now lie deep in the dark mossy ground. 
Take me home to the place, &c. 
Take me home, let me see what is left that I 
know, 
Can it be that the old house is gone ! 
The dear friends of my childhood indeed must be few, 
And I 
must lament all alone. 
But yet I'll return to the place of my birth, 
Where my children have play'd at the door ; [ earth 
Where they pua'd the white blossoms that garnished the 
Which will echo their footsteps no more. 
Take we home to the place, ctc. 
MY LOVE SHE LOVES ME NOT. 
Written and Composed by G. W . 
H UNT. 
I've loved a 
girl so deep and long, 
That of sense I 
am bereft ; 
I've made her heaps of presents, till 
I've scarce a 
penny left ; 
I 
tell her how I 
love her, and 
I 
pitch it jolly hot, 
But strange to say, unto this day, 
My love she loves me not. 
CHORUS. 
For her I'd go thro' fire, 
A 
mid ‘N'ater boiling het, 
If my love would only love me ; but 
My love she loves me not. 
I've taken her to parties, 
I've taken her to halls, 
I've taken her on the Elevated Rail, 
And up to the top of St. Pauls'; 
The Chamber of horrors at the Museum, 
And such cheering sights a 
lot; 
I've showed her Fulton Market, yes, 
But still she loves me not. 
For her I'd go thro' fire, &c. 
I've learnt to act like Kemblet, 
My lady-love to please, 
I 
swear in solemn tragic tones, 
And flop down on my knees. 
I 
sing " Die Wacht am Rhein" to her, 
And of other songs a 
lot; 
I've learnt to play the cheerful flute, 
But still she loves me not. 
For her I'd go thro' fire, Scc. 
Why Is she so eantankerouse, 
Why 
is she so unkind ? 
Why is she so obstropelouse? 
Why smash my piece of mind ? 
If she'd love me a 
little, 
I'd do I 
don't know what, 
For her l'd live on Australian beef, 
But, alas, she loves me not. 
-
For her I'd go thro' fire, &c.

THE GIRL AT THE SEWING BIACHINE. 
I 
am a 
most unlucky chap, who chanced one day to fall 
Bang over head and heels in love with a 
smart wench Sc 
tafl ; 
Her name was Jemima, Julia, Betsy Green, 
And she slaved away elgla hours a day at a Sewing 
Machine. 
CIIORUS 
Oh, now I've lost m3ri:eart, I 
wish I 
never had been, 
With that IliCe young girl, with lots of curls, who worked 
at a 
Sewing Machine, 
'Twas at a 
shop in Oxford street, 
gaw her first one day; 
Like hamme r and tongs at a 
No. 3, she was Nlorking away. 
I 
tipp'd the wink, which she returned, I 
saw she was'nt 
green, 
By signs she said, she'd very soon Le done at the Sewing 
Machine. 
Oh, now, &c. 
She came out when she'd done her work, we to a 
house 
went in, 
I 
melted half a 
dollar quick in brandy, rum and gin; 
A Hansom Cab I 
called, and to Cremorne we did go, 
Where both of us displayed our skill on the light fantastic 
toe. 
Oh, now, &c. 
She left me for a 
little while, and then came back to me 
That there was something in the wind, I 
Very soon could 
see; 
THE GIRL, 
&c.— [CONCLUDED. 
Said she, " Dear sir, this pocket book, just mind it for me 
I 
pray," 
Then put it bang into my fist, and stepp'd it clean away. 
Oh, now, &c. 
About five minutes afterwards, two bobbies came in view, 
And said, " a 
chap, a 
ticker has stole, we're certain that 
it's you ;" 
They lugged me to the station house, and swore that they 
were right, 
Then locked me in a 
cell, where I 
was minus grub all 
night. 
Oh, now, &c. 
Before the beak next morn at ten, they put me in the 
dock, 
The first word that the peelers said, quite gave my nerves 
a 
shock; 
Said they, " We in this pocketbook this paper did per-
ceive, 
Which, on inspection proved to be a 
genuine Ticket of 
Leave. 
Oh, now, &c. 
I 
told them how I 
came by it, the beak then shook his 
head, 
And did declare that he did not believe a 
word I'd said ; 
Said he, '‘ just take a 
twelve month, you have been bowl'd 
out clean, 
Then off they huddled me to goal, along with my Sewing 
Machine. 
Oh, now, &c.

THE CIRCUS MASTER. 
Written and Composed by A RTHUR LLOYD. 
In the circus I 
a 
ring-master am, 
Master am, master am ; 
In our corps is a 
beautiful girl, called Nan, 
Who has ta'en my heart by storm ; 
She is really so graceful 
In face, also in form, 
You'll always find the place full 
When she has to perform. 
CHORUS.—AQ 
round the ring she goes, 
Pointing her lovely toes, 
She is the cause of loud applause 
When she her agility shows. 
She's known to the public as Mademoiselle, 
Mademoiselle C. L. Estelle— 
Her proper name it is Nancy Bell, 
. Her mother's is the same; 
The applause tremendous sounds 
As I 
a flounce her name, 
Then in the ring she bounds. 
And my heart it does the same. [ As round, &c. 
My heart it goes pit-a-pat, of course, 
With dreadful force, with dreadful force, 
As I 
assist her to mount her horse, 
Then loudly crack my whip. 
All fear I 
know she scorns, 
As she proudly curls her lip, 
The' I 
stand as if on thorns, 
In case the darling slip. [As round, &c. 
After an act she makes a 
pause, 
Makes a pause, which always draws 
From the crowded audience loud applause, 
That makes the circus ring 
The clown then cracks his wheezes, 
Or a 
song perhaps he'll sing, 
And says, if the lady pleases, 
lie'!! some refreshment bring. 
rAs round, &c. 
Altho' I 
offer'd that girl my hand, 
That girl my hand, I 
understand 
She's going to be married to one of the band, 
At ten on Wednesdee. 
I 
wish them both success, and 
She happy ought to be, 
If she's loved by her husband 
As she's adored by me.
