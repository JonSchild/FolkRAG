I: 
All right. So, I’m already on air here. Are you? 
I2: 
Yup. 
I: 
Okay. Good. So, the first thing I want to say is thank you so much to both of you for doing this interview 
with us. 
LP: 
You’re welcome. 
I: 
And for the work that you do as personal care assistants, and I know PCAs go by many, many names. 
For this project, we’ve been referring to you as personal care assistants. And we have JK. 
JK: 
Yes. 
I: 
And L? 
P: 
P. 
I: 
P, joining us today, and we’re anxious to hear your stories about personal care work. We know the 
work you do is valuable, but we’re trying to get the message out to other people about what it is you do, and 
why it’s important. So, this is your chance to tell the world who you are and what you’re doing. So, J, I’m gonna 
start with you. Actually, L, think about this too, how you got into this kind of work, and why you did it, why you 
continue to do it? And, J, I know before we started you started to tell me about your grandparents, and maybe 
you could— 
JK: 
Yes. 
I: 
--finish that story. You grew up in Detroit? 
JK: 
Yes. I grew up in Detroit [22.04]. When I was a sophomore in high school, my grandparents bought 
property up here in Grayling. After I graduated, I went into the military, and then when I got out my grandpa 
had a major heart attack and needed some help around the house and help with taking care of his cats and 
stuff like that. So, I had moved up here to help them out, and my grandpa ended up getting better. I ended up 
staying up here. I lived with them for a while, and then about 2 years ago my grandpa was diagnosed with a 
brain tumor, and he passed away September of—a year and a half ago September. 
I: 
So, your grandma’s still living? 
JK: 
Yes. 
I: 
And are you still providing care for her? 
JK: 
Yes. She’s not as, you know, unhealthy or as sick as he was, but like she still needs help getting her 
medicines, and sometimes going to the doctor or going grocery shopping, and she really has nobody. I’m the 
only one up here, so we just—we’ll go over there and sit with her just so that she has company and stuff like 
that. 
I: 
You mentioned you were in the military. 
JK: 
Yes. 
I: 
Airforce. 
JK: 
Yes. 
I: 
Right? And any tours?

JK: 
I went to Iraq twice and Afghanistan once. 
I: 
Okay. And then when you came back you started doing this with your grandparents. 
JK: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
And then at some point you started doing it for other people who were not family members? 
JK: 
Yes. Actually, when I was doing it for my—helpin’ my grandparents out and stuff, I was actually a police 
officer [20.17]. 
I: 
A police officer. 
JK: 
Yes. So, I did that for almost 10 years, and then it just got to the point as a police officer that it just got 
too dangerous. I was married at the time, and people that I had arrested, and stuff were finding out where I 
was living and coming around and harassing me, but my step-kids were involved and stuff, so I told my ex-wife 
I need to find a job that I can do other than this, but still help people. And I found a place that would help me 
pay for the training to become a CNA, and I ended up doing that and I think it’s one of the best decisions I’ve 
made.  
I: 
In what way? 
JK: 
Just seein’ the joy on people’s faces when you’re providing them help that—with things that they can’t 
do and stuff like that. I mean it’s—it makes me feel like I’m making a difference. 
I: 
You mentioned you wanted to—you knew specifically that you wanted to do something that would help 
people. 
JK: 
Yes. 
I: 
And I’m guessing that’s one reason why you went into the police academy—became a police officer 
because you were helping people? 
JK: 
Yes. 
I: 
So, you know that about yourself? 
JK: 
Yes. 
I: 
And you find it rewarding, so you then went to work as a CNA? 
JK: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
For an agency or? 
JK: 
When I started I worked at a facility called Tender Care. I worked there for a little while in the dementia 
unit. I worked in the dementia unit for [18.24] a little less than a year, and then I went and worked for two 
different assisted-living facilities, and then I got a job offer with a travel agency that does contracts for both 
facilities, and homecare called Dedicated Nursing Associates and stuff. And I ended up going with them. They 
do contracts in like 4-week increments, and if you wanna stay—‘cause they’re contracted through different 
companies—if you wanna stay contracted with that company, you can have it renewed however many times 
you want or however long you want and stuff like that.  
I: 
So, you’ve been doing this kind of work now for a couple years? 
JK: 
Yes.

I: 
And it sounds like you like it? 
JK: 
Yes. 
I: 
Found a niche. 
JK: 
Yes. 
I: 
That’s great. L, what’s your story? How did you get into—you’ve been doin’ it a little longer than he has. 
LP: 
I have. I’ve been doing it 15 years—I’ve been certified, but I—my mom worked as a personal-care-aide 
at, you know, as a CNA when I was growing up, and in those days, it was okay to take your kids to work a lot. 
And so, I always told people that I, you know, half grew up in a local nursing home because that’s where my 
mom worked, and she worked long hours because, you know, CNAs do. So, I kinda grew up in a nursing home 
[16.56], and it’s just something I guess that’s in my blood in that, you know, I kinda always knew that I was 
gonna do this. 
I: 
So, you went through the training? 
LP: 
I did. 
I: 
You’re a CNA as well. 
LP: 
Yes. 
I: 
And worked in nursing homes, but also homecare, right? 
LP: 
Yes, yup. I did homecare for 8 years. 
I: 
Can you tell me what you like about it? What keeps you going? 
LP: 
Well, kinda, you know, the same thing that J said, but I think the relationships that you build with 
people. You know, in this line of work you do have a lot of people pass away, but knowing that, you know, you 
were able to hold somebody’s hand while they were dying because—and they weren’t alone, you know, 
because of that or just building the relationships, you know, the nicknames that the residents have for us, and 
you know, just those relationships—building those relationships with people and helping them. 
I: 
That’s important to you. 
LP: 
Yeah. 
I: 
Tell me what some of the hardest things are about being a PCA? 
LP: 
Well, like I just mentioned, watching somebody you love pass away [15.52]. It happens a lot, of course, 
so you, you know, kind of have to build that wall around your heart. You know, love people, but you have to be 
able to move on, and that’s hard. That’s one of the hardest parts. And then working with people with dementia 
is hard too. It’s different every day, and you know, an approach that works with them 1 minute might not work 5 
minutes later. So, just kind of always being on your toes, and you have to just adapt to every situation. 
I: 
That seems like a real skill— 
LP: 
Yeah. It definitely is. 
I: 
--to be able to think on your feet and problem solve right then and there. 
LP: 
It definitely is, yes. 
I: 
And what do you find difficult about it, J? What are some of the challenges you face? 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Jeremy Kilmas and Elizabeth Peterson. 7.23.18

JK: 
A lot of it’s the same thing with her is dealing with the death ‘cause a lot of these people that we work 
with and stuff they don’t have family, so you become their only family. And you get so attached to them, and 
they get attached to you, and then when something happens you have to be strong because you have to do 
the post-mortem care and stuff like that, so you have to be strong but inside it’s killing you because you’ve built 
such a strong relationship with them [14.20]. 
I: 
So, how do you deal with that? You’re strong for the family, but then what happens when you walk out 
the door? 
JK: 
I’m not gonna lie, there’s time that I’ve went home and cried because of a resident that I lost that I was 
really close with. There’s actually one resident that I still keep in contact with her son and daughter-in-law. 
When I was working at Tender Care in the dementia unit, she had dementia, but I was the only one that she 
remembered. If I wasn’t at work, they would literally have to call me at home to get her to let them do cares on 
her so that she could hear my voice. And she passed away, I was actually off the day that she passed away, 
and when they called her son to tell him that she had passed away he requested that they call me and see if I 
can come in there and do the post-mortem care on her. 
I: 
And did you? 
JK: 
Yes, because he wanted me to be there. And then about a week later he actually took casings from his 
rifle that he shot, and he polished ‘em up and made me a home-made ink pen and pencil out of ‘em. So, but— 
I: 
How does that make you feel? 
JK: 
It makes me feel good that the families and stuff see that what we do, you know, and how hard we work 
to make their family member, you know, comfortable while we still can and stuff like that, but I mean it makes 
me feel good. Like I said, that lady’s son he still invites me to, you know, their family events and stuff like that, 
and I mean it’s been 2 years, so. 
I: 
I imagine you have experiences where people aren’t quite so appreciative? 
JK: 
Yes. 
I: 
Any stories about that come to mind? 
JK: 
There was one resident that her son would always complain because when I was working at Tender 
Care [11.55], they do different things for the different holidays, and his mom was a Jehovah Witness, so he 
didn’t like the fact that she was around all that and stuff like that, and he wanted us to—anytime we had a 
holiday party—‘cause she was also in the dementia unit—anytime we had a holiday party or something like 
that he wanted us to put her in her room and lock her in there until we were done with it, and one, you can’t do 
that. That’s, you know, abuse, but even if we could I don’t feel that’s right to, you know, basically lock her up 
because he doesn’t—I mean like I said, she had dementia. She would talk about God all the time and talk 
about holidays and stuff, so she didn’t remember the fact that, you know, I mean I’m sure she remembered the 
fact that she was Jehovah Witness, but it didn’t bother her. It was her son that it bothered, and he used to 
always complain about it. He actually called the state on the facility at one point because we wouldn’t put her in 
her room for a Christmas party, so. 
I: 
We talked briefly about language and what the title of the work that you do—personal care assistance, 
but right before we got started you were talking about what some people refer to you as. 
JK: 
Yes. 
I: 
Can you go into more detail, and I’m sure you have examples too, L?

JK: 
The one biggest thing that you hear all the time is—when you tell somebody that you’re a CNA or a 
personal care worker—one of the first things they always say is, “Oh, so you’re a professional butt-wiper or you 
wipe butts for a living?” You know, stuff like that, and that’s not what we do. I mean there’s a lot more to it 
[9.55] than that. I mean, yeah, there’s times where we have to do that, but there’s a lot more to the job than just 
that. I mean you—like I said before, you know, sometimes there’s somebody that you’re taking care that 
literally the only help that they need is for you to sit there and talk to them. They need somebody to talk to; they 
need a companion because they don’t have family, and you’re the best thing to that. I mean there’s—I guess 
it’s hard to explain, but there’s a lot more to the job than just wiping butts. 
I: 
And how do you respond to somebody who says that to you? 
JK: 
I basically, you know, tell ‘em that’s not what we do, and I try to explain what we do and stuff like that, 
and some people will get it and some people don’t. I mean it’s just a matter of, you know, their thinking on it 
and stuff. But I try to explain it, but. 
I: 
It can’t feel too good? 
JK: 
No. 
I: 
How ‘bout you L? 
LP: 
I always tell people that what I do for a living is—and you know, I explain this to my kids like this when 
they were young that I’m taking care of God’s angels until he gets their house built. So, that’s how—what I 
always, you know, but it’s more than just that. Of course, it’s every aspect of care. You might get somebody, 
especially workin’ in a facility, you might get somebody who is there just for rehab because they broke their hip, 
and they’re there for a month for rehab and then they’re going home. You know, so—and it’s—you have to 
help ‘em with everything, you know. 
I: 
When you say I have to help them with everything, what does that mean? Explain—help people 
understand what that really means? 
LP: 
Well, it really means anything that you would do for yourself from the time you wake up in the morning, 
you know, something as simple as puttin’ your feet on the floor when you’re trying to get outta bed. Some 
people need help with even that. Brushin’ your teeth, brushin’ your hair, you know, giving showers— 
JK: 
Getting dressed. 
LP: 
Yup, getting dressed. Help, you know, with all their meals. Some people you just need to cut up their 
meat, other people you need to feed because they can’t do it on their own anymore [7.21]. 
JK: 
And some people just need the companionship. 
LP: 
Mmm hmm. 
JK: 
There was one resident that I worked with, again, when I worked in the dementia unit he was a World 
War II Vet. He knew that I was prior military, and everyday when I went to work the first thing he would say to 
me is, “Let’s share war stories. Let’s share war stories,” and I’d sit down with him for like half hour/45 minutes, 
and we would just talk about things that we did in the military, and that’s what made him happy. 
I: 
Validated him and his life. 
JK: 
Right. 
I: 
J, I wanna circle back to your story about the woman who’s son is still inviting you to family gatherings. 
Do you think that she responded to you the way she did partly because you’re a male, with a male voice? 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Jeremy Kilmas and Elizabeth Peterson. 7.23.18

JK: 
Yes. I think it was me bein’ a male, but I reminded her a lot of her grandson who he was in the military, 
and he was stationed over in Europe, so he never could come see her. But I reminded him of her ‘cause, you 
know, he was, you know, about my size and stuff like that, and I think that’s why she responded to me the most 
is because of the likenesses [5.45]. 
I: 
So, I’m glad we’re getting your perspective today because we only have one other guy in this project so 
far, and as you know there’s a huge shortage of personal care workers. 
LP: 
There is. 
I: 
But there’s also a huge demand for men— 
JK: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
--personal care workers. 
LP: 
Yes. 
I: 
And it’s hard to convince guys that this is a profession to go into, so I think—I’m really happy to get your 
viewpoint, but you could also speak to this too, the value of having male PCAs. Do you think it changes your 
perspective? Are there times when, you know, you’re asked to be a PCA just because you’re a male or guy? I 
mean what’s your perspective on all of this? 
JK: 
I mean I definitely feel that there needs to be more males. There’s, actually, one of the assisted-living 
facilities here in town or in Traverse City—there’s a lot of ‘em that is just females hired there. Where there’s 
been a couple people that work there said, you know, will say to me, “You need to come work here. We need 
males working here because of—sometimes the residents respond better to males.” You know, I’m not sayin’ 
anything about girls not being able to do certain things, but a lot of ‘em say that they need somebody that can 
do, you know, some of the more heavier lifting and stuff like that. And I don’t know, I guess, I definitely think 
that there needs to be more males, but there’s a shortage everywhere with males and females in this career 
field. I mean no matter where you look everybody’s hiring for males and females to do this.  
I: 
So, when you’re talking to people and trying to explain what you do for a living, and they are saying, 
“Well, you’re a professional butt wiper,” do you ever get any response about, you know, “Well, you’re a guy”? 
JK: 
Yes. When I first started doin’ it and stuff, the first thing people would say is, “Why are you doing that? 
That’s a female career.” But in reality, it’s not. They need males just as bad as they need females. I mean, 
yeah, in the past, like years ago and stuff, yeah, it was only females that did it and stuff. But a lot of things have 
changed to where they need males in this career, you know. 
I: 
L, what’s your perspective on all this? 
LP: 
I think it is so valuable to have male coworkers because people respond differently to, you know, 
different people and different personalities, so you have some, you know, especially men who would prefer to 
have another man give ‘em a shower versus a female, or you know, somebody that they can related to, and 
you know talk to or share war stories with or—and there’s some females that would prefer a male, you know, 
just more comfortable with them, and I think with men too, there’s less drama, you know, as coworkers. And 
then, of course, you have the, you know, there’s lots a times where, you know, we get hit and punched, and 
you know, just having a male there to—even just in the room sometimes is enough to keep somebody from—
keeping a male resident from [1.32] hitting, you know. 
I: 
We had one—we, actually, do have two now that I’m thinkin’ about it, but one of ‘em said he will not 
take female clients ever. It’s one of his rules because he’s so worried about being accused of sexual 
misconduct.

Jeremy Kilmas and Elizabeth Peterson. 7.23.18

LP: 
Yeah. 
JK: 
And see that’s the thing when working in like a facility— 
LP: 
That’s sad. 
JK: 
--I would always—anytime I went into a female’s room I would always have another CNA go in the 
room with me that way there would be nothing that could be said. I would always  have a witness [.48] no 
matter what. 
I: 
And then we’ve had a supervisor say that they prefer to put women with women—or with men 
because—or men with men, sorry, because there are some male clients who are sexually inappropriate with 
PCAs. 
JK: 
Yes. 
LP: 
Right. Yes. They can be very sexually [laughing] inappropriate at times, very [laughs]. 
JK: 
And that actually happens more often than not. 
LP: 
Yes. 
I: 
More often than not. 
JK: 
Yes. 
LP: 
Yeah. 
I: 
And then there’s the physical—just being able to do the heavier lifting. 
LP: 
Yup. 
I: 
So, we’re gonna take a brief pause. I can’t believe it’s already been 25 minutes, but okay. So, K, are 
you picking up their voices okay? [End tape 1]. 
I2: 
Okay. I am recording now. 
I: 
Okay. I’m not. I will be soon. All right. Here we are, Part 2 of this interview. So, we’re going to shift 
gears a little bit and talk about—get some more stories. Talk about some of your specific experiences as 
personal care workers. We kind of left it off talking about people being sexually inappropriate. Either the clients 
are or some PCAs, maybe. I don’t know. 
LP: 
Yup [laughs]. 
I: 
We have had the good fortune of talking with PCAs who are really dedicated, who are driven by, you 
know, a servant’s heart. 
LP: 
Yeah. 
I: 
And they want to do good work in the world, but I know there are a lot of PCAs out there that aren’t like 
that. 
LP: 
Yeah. 
JK: 
Right. 
I: 
I’m guessing you’ve worked with a few of ‘em? 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Jeremy Kilmas and Elizabeth Peterson. 7.23.18 
 
7
JK: 
Yeah. 
LP: 
We have. 
 
I: 
So, and you can probably tell us what defines a good PCA versus one that’s not so great, that should 
be in another line of work? 
LP: 
Well, I think that, you know, somebody who’s just [21.43] there for the paycheck is definitely in the 
wrong line of work, and then you have people who, mmm, come thinking that—if not knowing exactly what we 
do, and just plain don’t have the patience for it because this job does take a lot of patience. 
JK: 
It takes a lotta patience. 
I: 
It takes a lot of patience. You mentioned thinking on your feet, problem solving and— 
LP: 
Yes. 
I: 
--negotiating each situation. 
LP: 
Yes. 
JK: 
A lot of the patience comes in, too, when you’re working with somebody who has dementia because I 
mean 1 second they could be, you know, your best friend, tell you how much they love you and how happy 
they are for you to be there to help them with the things that they need help with, and then literally in a split 
second they could be kicking and punching you and cussing at you and telling you what a horrible person you 
are and stuff like that. So, I mean you have to be extremely patient when it comes to the residents with 
dementia. 
I: 
So, you mentioned that you’ve been referred to as a butt wiper. How do you feel about it when people 
say the work is unskilled or low-skilled? What would you say to people? 
LP: 
I would say that that is definitely untrue. It takes a lot of skill as far as, you know, knowing what you’re 
doing, and professional-wise, but it also takes a lotta skill, you know, personal-wise, and you have to have 
patience, and you have to have that love in your heart for the people. And so, I think that it is even, you know, 
above and beyond skilled—that you have to have to able to work in this career field. 
I: 
And what would you say to that J? 
JK: 
I agree with her a hundred percent. I mean it takes a lotta skill to do this job [19.32]. You have to 
genuinely care about your job and the people you’re taking care of in order to make it in this career. And like 
she said, you know, you have to have a lotta patience. There’s no other way you would be able to do this job. 
I: 
So, I’m gonna throw several scenarios. You’ve already mentioned one. You’ve both talked about being 
punched and hit and people flailing while you’re giving them a bath. It’s obviously something you’ve both 
experienced? 
LP: 
Yup. 
JK: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
It comes with the territory? 
LP: 
Definitely is, yup. 
JK: 
Yes. 
LP: 
It’s part of the job, yup. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Jeremy Kilmas and Elizabeth Peterson. 7.23.18 
 
8
I: 
Part of the job, and you just accept that? 
LP: 
Yeah. 
JK: 
Yes. 
I: 
And how do you protect yourself? 
LP: 
[Laughs] 
JK: 
[Laughs] you—in reality you can, and you can’t protect yourself. I mean it’s kind of a gray area ‘cause I 
mean you can only—you can’t do certain things because, you know, it could be abuse or whatever and stuff 
like that [18.28]. A lot of the times, like, if I’m workin’ in a facility or something, like, I’ll walk away and grab 
another CNA. A lot of the times a change of face, you know, different scenery and stuff will calm the resident 
down or whatever, or I’ll just, you know, if they try to punch me, like, I’ll just kind of keep an open hand and try 
and block it or whatever, and try and say somethin’, you know, so that their state of mind changes, and they 
calm down a little bit. But other than that, that’s pretty much all you can do. 
I: 
So, it happens to you—because you were saying sometimes if there’s a male in the room that’s enough 
to deter somebody— 
LP: 
Yup. 
I: 
But it sounds like it happens to you as well, J— 
JK: 
Yes. 
LP: 
Yeah. Some people. 
JK: 
There’s some people that it doesn’t matter if you’re male, female, if you’re related to ‘em or what. I 
mean it’s just—it happens. I mean that’s all part of the career, but— 
I: 
Do you worry about injury? Have you ever been injured? 
LP: 
I have. 
JK: 
I actually, when I worked in the dementia unit, I actually had to get stitches in the top of my head 
because one of the residents took a glass vase and smashed it over my head. 
I: 
Wow. So, you’ve been injured from physical violence? 
JK: 
Yes. 
I: 
And you were starting to say something? 
LP: 
Yeah. I’ve been punched in the face. I mean I never had to, you know, seek medical treatment for it, 
but—and it’s just something that happens, but part of our skillset, and something that you learn very quickly is 
to be able to kind of predict when that’s gonna happen, and you know, be ready for it [16.39]. I mean you learn 
really fast to be able to see that coming, to be able to see, even if the person is non-verbal, to be able to see 
the agitation in their face and in their body language and stuff. I mean it’s just something you have to learn 
[laughs]. 
JK: 
Just by their actions or their facial expressions and stuff, you—as you get to know the different 
residents and stuff like that, you can see that. I mean you can predict he’s gonna start swingin’ or she’s gonna 
start kicking or whatever, just by their body language, basically.

I: 
So, one of the things we were talking about earlier is that I think describing this to people and saying, 
“Well, we go into people’s homes,” doesn’t even begin to explain what you face when you go into those 
homes— 
LP: 
Correct. 
I: 
--and the range of homes that you get into. Can you talk about that for a minute? Maybe what the range 
is, and an example at both ends? 
LP: 
It’s just astronomical the difference in, you now, people’s homes. I’ve been in, you know, homes right 
on the bay that were a million dollar plus that had, you know, walk-in showers, and so you could, you know, 
take somebody into the shower and not have a problem, and then I’ve been in a home just south of here where 
it was a husband taking care of his wife, who his wife was 92, and she could not step over the side of the tub, 
so he built her a shower in the basement, and he would carry her downstairs to the shower. You know, I would 
come three times a week [14.51] to shower her, and he would carry her down the stairs, and you know, he built 
the shower in the basement so that she could, you know, actually get in the shower. And that was, you know, a 
pretty run-down, very poor place. 
I: 
How ‘bout you J? 
JK: 
Same thing. I mean you go into some really nice houses where like she said, like million-dollar homes 
and stuff like that, but then there’s some houses where you go into where it’s so run-down you wonder how it’s 
not condemned.  
I: 
Can you think of an example, a story? 
JK: 
There was one house that I went into in Petosky, probably about—well, it was right after I left Tender 
Care, so it was a while ago, where literally every window in the front of the house had cracks all the way down 
it. The screen door was literally just hanging there by one pin. You walked into the house, and just the smell of 
the house—it smelt like feces all over and stuff. I mean, but then I’ve gone into houses where they were in 
gated communities that were—I mean you walk into the house, and they got marble countertops and stuff like 
that, and you can just tell that, you know, these people, you know, they have money and stuff like that. And 
then, like I said, the other houses, you know, you go into and it’s like—you feel bad for them because of their 
living conditions and stuff, but you know, you really can’t do much about that. You know what I’m saying? 
LP: 
At the end of the day regardless of your, you know, economic situation everybody— 
JK: 
Everybody deserves the same care. 
LP: 
Yeah. And everybody’s gonna need that care at some point. 
I: 
And of course, economic status doesn’t guarantee that they’re—it doesn’t tell you whether they’re nice 
people— 
JK: 
Right. 
LP: 
Exactly. Yup. 
JK: 
Right. I mean you could go to, you know, somebody who’s got a million-dollar house and them be the 
rudest people you’ve ever met, you know. And go to somebody that’s living in a run-down house that smells 
like feces when you walk in, and then be the most genuine and caring people you’ve ever met in your life 
[11.56]. 
LP: 
Or vice versa.

JK: 
Right. 
I: 
And I’m sure you’ve seen a whole range of families—family members and family dynamics and had to 
sort of deal with family dynamics. 
LP: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
Can you think of some examples? 
LP: 
I took care of a gentleman who had Alzheimer’s, and his wife took care of him, and she had adopted—
or she had guardianship of two of her grandkids and had adopted the youngest granddaughter. So, you know, 
you would come into their house and the nicest people you’d ever hope to me. They all were just a really, really 
loving, genuine family who all worked together to take care of grandpa, and I mean it just depended on the 
day. She had other grandkids that would, you know, stay there, here and there, would move in and move out, 
and you know, daughter who was over the road trucking, and you know, she would be there sometimes, and 
you know, you just—just an absolutely wonderful family. And you know, just a lot of dynamics there with the 
family, and a lot of, you know, heartbreak and, you know, a lot of—a lot of love in the family to go around. They 
all, you know, kind of took care of each other, and grandma was definitely the matriarch of the family, and they 
all kind of took care of each other. 
JK: 
But then you see families on the other end [10.33] of the spectrum, too, that I’ve had families actually 
straight up tell me, “I don’t wanna deal with my grandpa or my dad’s problems. You can deal with it.” They 
don’t wanna be called or contacted for anything. They never come see ‘em, you know, and so you see both 
ends of the spectrum. 
I: 
Mmm hmm. So, one of the things about homecare—maybe this isn’t true for you, but especially that 
first visit and all you have to go on is what the agency’s given you, maybe a sheet of paper that shays you’re 
doing companionship work today or something. 
LP: 
Yup. 
I: 
Maybe a diagnosis. Maybe you get more information than that, but have you ever walked into a 
situation where you were just felt totally unprepared? Like this—yeah you both nodded. 
LP: 
[Laughing] 
JK: 
It happens more than you would think. 
LP: 
Yup. You just kind of have to go with the flow [laughing]. What do you do, you know? 
I: 
What was the biggest surprise you ever got? 
LP: 
I had a client that I took care of and her daughter went on vacation, and a really nice family. Her and 
the daughter actually both passed away now, but really super nice family. Daughter and son-in-law, who the 
mom lived with went on vacation, and her son, the client’s son was staying with her for, you know, the duration 
of their vacation—2 weeks or whatever, and I walked in I didn’t know that they were going out of town or 
anything, so I walked in, you know, to come and give their mom a shower, and the son was probably the most 
sexually inappropriate gentleman I have ever met in my life—you know, I felt uncomfortable enough to where I 
went outside and called my boss, and said, somebody needs to come out here [laughs] and be with me. I 
can’t—I’m not staying here. I have to leave, or somebody needs to come out, and so I left, and we rescheduled 
the visit, and from them on when the son was in town, and you know, it happened here and there, when the 
son was in town or staying with his mom we would double up. We would have two people go instead of just 
one. You know—

Jeremy Kilmas and Elizabeth Peterson. 7.23.18

I: 
So, you felt unsafe? 
LP: 
Very unsafe, and you know, I eventually had to tell him, you know, you’re being really inappropriate 
right now. So, you know, you need to stop or I’m going to leave. So. 
I: 
And he stopped? 
LP: 
No. He never did, but [laughing]. 
I: 
He never—how ‘bout you? What was your biggest surprise? 
JK: 
Actually, I was supposed to go to a house in Petosky where the guy had Alzheimer’s He was living by 
himself, and actually wen I got there and walked into the house he had two guns sitting on the table [7.30] with 
Alzheimer’s and by himself, which I definitely didn’t feel safe with that at all. So, again, I called—I was working 
for a company called AdvisaCare. I actually called my boss, and they sent another CNA out to come with me, 
but they also sent a social worker to help get the guns out of the way and stuff like that. And, basically, I was 
told if I go back there and he had guns out again to call the police instead of them, but they dealt the first time. 
It didn’t happen again, but. 
I: 
So, you didn’t feel safe. 
JK: 
No. 
I: 
There are times when you’ve gone into a home and you really did not feel safe. 
JK: 
Right. 
I: 
You felt like your life was in danger. 
JK: 
Right. 
I: 
Okay. I know a lot of what you do is trying to keep your clients safe. 
LP: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
And that’s hard to do sometimes, isn’t it? 
LP: 
Very hard to do. 
I: 
Can you explain that to people? Why is that hard? 
LP: 
Well, it depends on the situation. I had a client who she lived by herself. She had, you know, dementia, 
and they had tried already to place a guardian with her, and it did not go through. The courts said, no, that she 
was not at a point where she needed a guardian [5.57] but could not regulate her pills at all. So, even having 
somebody come out, which was what we eventually did. We would have somebody come out and set her pills 
up in like a pillbox for her, but she still couldn’t, you know, remember to take them or what pills to take when. 
Even, you know, we had it color-coded and all set out and wrote everything down for her, and she still, you 
know, couldn’t, and it was—kind of our hands were tied even working with social workers and trying, you know, 
documenting everything, and trying to get a guardian for her because she was her own guardian, we still— 
I: 
No family? 
LP: 
Nope. No family that cared. She did have family, but they, you know, wanted kind of nothing to do with 
her even though they lived next door. They didn’t help at all, and she’s, you know— 
I: 
What happened? 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Jeremy Kilmas and Elizabeth Peterson. 7.23.18 
 
12
LP: 
Eventually, she ended up falling and breaking her hip, so she went into a nursing home from there, but, 
you know, probably the fact that she couldn’t take the right pills at the right time had, you know, an impact on 
her falling and breaking her hip.  
I: 
How ‘bout you? Times when it’s been hard to keep a client safe? 
JK: 
You get a lotta times where there’s residents and stuff that forget that they can’t walk or that they can’t 
stand up on their own and stuff, and they try to get up and stuff, and you gotta, you know, keep them from 
falling, but in the same sense in this career, you’re always told they have a right to fall. So, you can’t force 
them to sit back down. You can just basically advise them, you know, your legs are weak. You know, we gotta 
get your legs stronger before you can stand up [3.56] and start walking and stuff like that, and if they choose to 
sit down after that, then that’s good. But if they don’t, you can’t force them to do anything they do wanna do. 
I: 
So, I’m glad you brought that up ‘cause there’s so much talk these days about person-centered care 
and respecting people’s values and preferences, and the right for people to make bad decisions. So, how do 
you balance that because the flip side of that is safety. 
JK: 
Right. 
I: 
Yeah. So, how do you balance keeping somebody safe, but also trying to honor their wishes or let them 
do what you might consider is dangerous? 
JK: 
Well, like the biggest thing with the whole, they have the right to fall thing, it’s not a matter of them 
falling to get hurt. I mean you can’t force them to sit down, but if you see that they’re starting to fall, you can 
help guide them to the floor so that they don’t get hurt. Different things like that. I mean like there’s residents 
that they have trouble swallowing, so you have to give them pureed food and stuff like that. But there was 
actually one that had dementia that I worked with where no matter how many times you stated it his son who 
was his guardian, he just didn’t get the fact that his dad couldn’t swallow properly and couldn’t eat, you know, a 
Big Mac and stuff that. And everyday he would try to feed him. He would bring him Burger King or 
MacDonald’s and stuff, and you know, you can advise ‘em, but you know, what could happen. You know, he 
could coke or whatever, but again, you can’t force his son not to give it to him. It’s his son’s decision being his 
guardian. 
LP: 
Yup. Lot’s of patient education and family education is big [1.54]. 
I: 
Is part of your role? 
JK: 
Yes. 
LP: 
Absolutely. Yup. Absolutely. 
I: 
So, the dietary example is a good one with people who wanna eat—I’m thinking of diabetics for 
example. 
LP: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
--who wanna eat sweets. 
LP: 
Yup. 
JK: 
And there’s a lot of facilities now that have special like snacks and stuff for residents with diabetes and 
stuff like that, where they can still have snacks and feel like they’re, you know, getting a sweet treat and stuff, 
but it not, you know, really be like hurting them.

I: 
So, I’m coming back to your story about the medication, and this woman here didn’t really have 
anybody to do it for her.  
LP: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
What would happen—what happens to people like her if there’s nobody like you? 
LP: 
You know, I don’t know. I think that it would just—I think she would probably end up dying, honestly 
[.51]. You know, and she definitely would not have been able to live in her home as long as she did without, 
you know, personal care aides or people coming in to help take care of her. 
I: 
So, you make the difference between people being able to stay home? 
LP: 
Absolutely. 
I: 
Or going to a nursing home. 
LP: 
Mmm hmm. Absolutely. 
I: 
Okay. I’m told we have to pause. 
LP: 
Okay [laughs]. 
I: 
I’m gonna take this minute just to shift my chair ‘cause now the sun is really coming. 
LP: 
Right. Right in your face. 
I: 
Yeah. This next section is going to be more about bigger context, so think about what you wanna tell 
the world about the work that you do. I’m guessing you don’t get asked this—[end tape 2]. Okay. Part 3. So, 
let’s talk about that a little bit more about what people do, don’t know. You know, we were just saying that the 
work that you do is somewhat hidden ‘cause it’s done in the privacy of people’s homes. So, it’s not like a 
nursing home where they can see what you’re doin’. Although the work isn’t all that different is it? 
JK: 
No. 
LP: 
No. 
I: 
The technical skills are the same? 
JK: 
Yes. 
LP: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
The people skills are the same. 
LP: 
Right. 
I: 
Maybe what’s different is you don’t have a whole support staff standing right behind you. You can’t 
scream for a nurse— 
JK: 
Right. And there’s a lot of the times when you’re in somebody’s home, you’re there by yourself with 
them. 
LP: 
Right. And supplies and, you know, in a nursing home you have shower rooms where, you know, you 
can set somebody on a rolling chair and wheel them into the shower. In homes it’s completely different. You 
just have to adapt with what’s there. Sometimes they have to step over [24.30] the edge of the tub. Or 
sometimes they have to, you know, scooch back and sit and then swing their legs over or, you know, you have 
to adapt to what they have. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Jeremy Kilmas and Elizabeth Peterson. 7.23.18 
 
14
JK: 
I mean, and there’s sometimes where you’re in a home where people don’t have a shower chair, but 
they need to be sitting down while you’re doing it. So, you have to use a chair like that white plastic one, you 
know, and you just have to adapt to, you know, what’s in the house that you can use or whatever. 
LP: 
You become very skilled in, you know, figuring it out [laughs]. 
JK: 
Right. 
I: 
Using what you have available, looking around saying, okay, how are we gonna make this work? 
LP: 
Yup. 
I: 
So, you’ve mentioned the bathing, and that’s a great example. I think it doesn’t tell people—when you 
say, yeah. I help people bath. I don’t think that even begins to tell people the range of scenarios of bathing, and 
what it takes to keep somebody safe just even bathing, right? 
LP: 
Right. It’s huge. 
I: 
What’s the most difficult experience you’ve ever had giving somebody a bath? 
LP: 
I used to take care of this gentleman in his home, and he had kind of a corner shower with like glass 
that kind of enclosed it, and so there was a small door in the front. And he couldn’t walk, and there was no way 
to, you know, even wheel something into a shower. So, his wife and myself would—we would transfer him from 
his wheelchair onto a stool, and then I would have to get in the shower, and you know, I, of course, would bring 
shorts with me and a tank top, and I would have to get in the shower with him and actually bath him from inside 
his shower because once I was in there, there was no way for me to get out. So, I would have to get in there, 
and kind of pull him back into—off of the stool onto the chair in the shower, and then bath him while I was in 
the shower with him because there was just no other way to do it [22.25]. 
I: 
Wow. That’s quite a story. 
LP: 
So, and you know, taking a shower was very important to him. Some people, you know would be fine 
with a bed bath, and he just wasn’t. He wanted to have a shower, and you know, dignity issues and all of that. 
You know, we just did what we had to do, so I would take a shower with him [laughing], you know, fully clothed, 
of course, myself. 
I: 
Soaked. 
LP: 
Yes [laughing]. 
JK; 
You definitely get wet no matter how you do it. 
LP: 
And you just have to change when you’re done. Yeah. 
JK: 
I mean even if you’re outside the shower, you definitely need to bring a change of clothes whether it’s 
scrubs or somethin’ else because you will get wet. I mean. 
I: 
I’m also thinking of slippery floors. 
JK: 
Yup. 
LP: 
Yup. 
JK: 
 A lot of ‘em I like to make sure even if I have to buy it out of my own pocket, is buy one of them non-
slip mats for the shower. 
LP: 
Yeah. They have to have a mat [21.31]. It’s imperative for their safety. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Jeremy Kilmas and Elizabeth Peterson. 7.23.18 
 
15
JK: 
And like there was one resident that I had to do at her house where almost the same situation as her, 
except this lady was a double amputee. And me and her husband who was in his 80s had to get her into the 
shower, but she had a disease that—I don’t know what the disease is called, but it basically turns your organs 
into stone. It’s a deadly. I mean you die from it, so like all her organs were starting to harden, which made her 
even heavier, so me and this 80-year-old guy had to pick her up and put her in the shower, and I mean it gets 
stressful sometimes. 
LP: 
Just imagine how hard the husband’s life was before you came along to help. 
JK: 
Right. 
I: 
How could he do it?  
LP: 
Yeah. 
I: 
How could he do it? So, J, you made a comment earlier about if you didn’t have these skills, like being 
able to problem-solve and be patient and all of this, you couldn’t make it in this field. 
JK: 
No. 
I: 
Right? But you didn’t talk about the financial. How do you make it financially? 
JK: 
There’s times where it’s hard. You definitely need somebody with a second income to help. I mean 
most CNAs even working in a facility [19.57] start about $10 an hour. I mean even like her with 15 years of 
experience, is still makin’ less than $18 an hour. I mean I only make between $14—depending on where I go, 
$14 or $15 an hour, so I mean there’s not a—I mean and like I said, the cost of living’s going up and stuff like 
that. So, it’s—you struggle a lot, but in the same sense, the things that you do to help people is very rewarding. 
I: 
Makes it worth it? 
JK: 
Right. 
I: 
And it’s not just the pay rate, it’s whether you get enough hours. 
JK: 
Right. 
I: 
And do you get enough hours? 
JK: 
For the most part you do. I mean there’s times where depending on what company you work for where 
you only can get part-time hours. But there’s also places where you’re gettin’ called in every day you have off 
because they’re so short staffed, and so I mean you can get the hours. But like I said, depending on where 
you’re working there may not be the hours out there for you and stuff. 
I: 
So, L, you were talking before we got started that your mother and dad just moved in with you? And 
your mom has a been a PCA for years and years, right? 
LP: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
And they’re not able to make ends meet. Your dad is sick. 
LP: 
Yup. 
I: 
So, they’ve moved in here for financial reasons. 
LP: 
Right. 
I: 
Do you wanna talk a little bit about makin’ it as a CNA? 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Jeremy Kilmas and Elizabeth Peterson. 7.23.18 
 
16
LP: 
It’s definitely hard. It’s, you know, one income doing this job is just not enough. It’s not, you know, what 
we make it’s not enough to live. It’s not especially if you have kids and, you know, worrying about daycare 
[17.53], and it’s just not enough to live off of. 
I: 
So, what do you make of the disconnect between the fact that there’s this huge shortage of PCAs, the 
work you do is vitally important to people being able to stay at home, it’s the difference between a broken hip 
and safely staying at home. 
LP: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
And yet, you can’t make a living at it. 
LP: 
Yeah. It’s sad. It’s sad. I feel like it’s, you know, the work that we do is important, and I feel like it’s kind 
of a forgotten profession. People don’t think about it, and people don’t realize the importance of the work that 
we do, and you know, I feel like if more people did realize it would, you know, boost the pay. 
JK: 
And like we said before, a lotta people don’t truly understand what our job entails, and they only see, 
you know, the bad part, the wipin’ butts and stuff like that, and you know, like she said before people will look 
at you and say, “I don’t know how you do it. I couldn’t do that for a living and stuff.” But they truly don’t 
understand what we do, and that’s why it, you know, steers them away from this career. 
I: 
Yeah. I think one reasons people are not interested in talking about it is because we’re so—as a 
society—so uncomfortable with talking about bodily functions. 
JK: 
Mmm hmm. 
LP: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
And human excrement, and— 
LP: 
right. 
I: 
--right? 
LP: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
We’re taught not to as little kids. You don’t talk about that. 
JK: 
Right. 
LP: 
Right. 
I: 
And here you are helping people with exactly that, so you know, it’s always striking to me people who 
say butt wiper, well, they have to wipe their rear ends. 
JK: 
Right. 
LP: 
Right. 
I: 
They have to do it. We all do it. So, what’s gonna happen when they need help? 
LP: 
Exactly [15.50]. 
I: 
So, pretend for a minute that I am a legislator or I’m the Governor, and you have to convince me that 
this is important work you do, and we should be paying attention to it. What would you say to me? 
JK: 
Mmm, you know, I would explain, you know, what we do and stuff, and that eventually in people’s life, 
you know, everybody will eventually need help at some point whether it’s in their home, in a facility, and you 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Jeremy Kilmas and Elizabeth Peterson. 7.23.18 
 
17
know, I think the best way to put it is like she said, we’re helping angels until God gets their house built and 
stuff like that because, you know, just because they can’t do things for their self, why should we not, you know, 
why should somebody not be able to help them and stuff like that, so… 
I: 
Everybody’s gonna need it. 
JK: 
Right. 
I: 
Even me. 
JK: 
Right. I mean eventually everybody’s gonna need it whether it’s just somebody for companionship or 
helping get their meds or being at a facility, you know, and needing help with everything. Everybody’s gonna 
eventually need the help, so why not, you know, get the word out there now, you know, so that we can get 
more help in this career field, so that, you know, you don’t have CNAs that are workin’ 80-90 hours a week, 
you know. Where they, you know, and they can actually be able to do their job and help other people, but still 
be able to spend, you know, time their kids and stuff like that. Like she gets her kids back today at 5, and she’s 
gotta go to work at 11, so she’s not gonna get much time with her kid. You know, and I mean it’s—if we had 
more people in the career, you know, you could work a 40-hour week, and yeah, like we said before, you 
struggle with the pay and stuff, but it’s worth it when you, you know, see the reaction of the residents or, you 
know, whatever, and when you help them and stuff and how happy they are to see you come to work and, you 
know help them [13.16]. 
I: 
What would you tell me? 
LP: 
Kind of the same thing. Kind of the same thing. 
I: 
Okay. So, let’s say you’ve convinced me that this work is important. Someday I’m gonna need it, and 
I’m selfish and I want somebody to take care of me, how do we fix this problem? What should I do? 
LP: 
I feel like with any profession, offering a higher wage is important. People are attracted to career fields 
where they can make a living and support themselves. You know, and that’s just not the case with this 
profession. And it’s expensive to take the class, and you know, take the state test, and I feel like that should be 
more readily available to people. More, you know, programs to help people pay for that. 
I: 
How about you? Do you have recommendations? 
JK: 
Well, like she said with the pay and everything I mean like she said, you know, people look at jobs and 
say, okay, this is what they pay an hour, and this job pays this an hour. I’m gonna take the one with the more 
money, but I also think that, you know, they should educate kids more on it like junior/seniors in high school. 
You know, give them education and stuff, you know. And like she said, the cost of the classes and stuff. I mean 
you’re paying anywhere between $900 and $1500 to take the class, and then another $200 to take the state 
test and stuff, make it more readily available. You’ve got jobs like construction companies that you get free 
training at and stuff, but healthcare workers have to, you know, pay thousands of dollars to get their training 
and stuff. I mean it should be more readily available like other jobs are [11.06]. 
I: 
So, you said educate teenagers, high school students. What would— 
JK: 
Have a class in the high school, you know, like they have the sex-ed class or whatever. Make a class 
on, you know, like different jobs. Where you can learn different aspects of different jobs. It don’t have to be just 
this career field, but like throughout the year, you know, learn about different types of jobs or do like, umm, 
classes where you can go work a job and get paid, you know, get your credits for school, and you know, make 
the money and know what it’s like to be in the workforce.

I: 
What would you tell a young person? Why should they pick this field? Low pay, no respect, what’s the 
plus thing? 
JK: 
It’s very rewarding. 
I: 
It’s very rewarding. 
JK: 
Yes. 
LP: 
Very rewarding. 
I: 
And that’s the main thing that keeps you in it? 
JK: 
Yes. 
I: 
And low-pay doesn’t deter you, and it’s not—you just keep going it because you— 
LP: 
Well, there’s also a shortage of CNAs or personal care workers [9.58], so you generally always have 
the option of picking up more hours, so if you have a good work ethic [laughing], and you’re willing to work 
overtime, it’s always there. It’s always available. 
I: 
So, you might not always get the number of hours you want, but you fee like it’s a job that—there’s 
always gonna be a job? 
LP: 
Yes. 
JK: 
Right. 
LP: 
Yes. 
I: 
What do you say to people who say that personal care workers just jump ship all the time for a quarter 
here, quarter there? Why don’t they just go down to MacDonald’s and make $15 an hour? 
LP: 
I think this is a calling not just a job. 
JK: 
Right. 
LP: 
It is, you know, caring for people or, you know, public service is a way of life for people, those who are 
dedicated. 
I: 
Because McDonald’s is always gonna be there. 
LP: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
You could get set hours there, and probably $15 an hour, so why not go there, MacDonald’s, you 
know? 
LP: 
Right. 
JK: 
Like she said, it’s—for somebody to work in this career field it’s a calling. I mean you get people that will 
take the class and stuff and get their license for it and stuff, and once they actually get on the floor or whatever 
and doin’ the job and stuff, they’ll straight up look at you and be like, “This ain’t for me,” and quit [8.33]. But like 
you get people like us where the second we stepped into the job, we knew that’s what we wanted to do and 
there was nothing gonna stop us from doing that. 
I: 
So much so, that you’re willing to live a life that’s a little bit paycheck to paycheck? 
LP: 
Mmm hmm.

JK: 
Right. I mean and don’t get me wrong, there’s times where, you know, we’ll look at each other and be 
like, I wish I got more money, but that’s not why we’re in this career. We’re not in it for the money. We, you 
know, it would be nice to have, you know, get more money and hour or whatever, but we’re in it because we 
genuinely care about the people that we’re taking a care of and not just them, but their families as well. 
I: 
So, you have no plans to leave this profession? 
JK: 
No. 
LP: 
No. 
I: 
No. 
LP: 
I have plans to further my career [laughing], you know. 
I: 
In what way? 
LP: 
Further my education. I either wanna be an RN or a paramedic, so eventually when I grow up that’s my 
plan [laughs] [7.23]. 
I: 
So, you might go to school down the road? 
LP: 
Yeah. 
JK: 
And the same thing. I eventually wanna be an RN or work for like the fire department or paramedic, but 
like my goal that I’ve always had—well, since I started in this career was, I’ve always either wanted to be a 
surgical nurse or work in the ER. 
I: 
Okay. So someday that’s what you’ll be doing? 
JK: 
Yes. 
I: 
So, part of what we’re doing here is trying to let the public get a sense of who you are as people, and 
we know that there’s more to you than just being a PCA. That’s your professional—your choice of professions, 
but there’s—you’re a more well-rounded person that that. You have kids? You have hobbies? You have, right? 
JK: 
Right. 
I: 
Do you want to just take a minute and tell us about who you are? How would you describe yourself, L? 
LP: 
Well— 
I: 
You like dogs. 
LP: 
[Laughs] I do. I have three kids. My kids are—my daughter’s 17, and my boys are 13 and 10, and 
that’s, you know, they’re my life, of course. I think like any other mom. I like dogs and watching my kids play 
baseball. My boys both play baseball, and I’m a huge family person. You know, our family’s always together, 
and we’re, you know, I guess that pretty much sums me up [laughing]. 
I: 
You said earlier you learned your caregiving from your mom? 
LP: 
I did, yes.  
I: 
Who’s a caregiver. 
LP: 
She is. 
I: 
How would you describe yourself?

JK: 
I don’t have any kids. I did when I was married before I had five step kids. All of us for the past [5.23] 9 
years have been involved with mixed Martial Arts, did a lot of cage fighting. I used to own a gym. I used to own 
a fight team, and I used to train people. I, you know, I played baseball my whole life. I had offers to college to 
play baseball and stuff and decided that it would be best for me go into the military instead of going to college, 
and that’s pretty much what I did. 
I: 
As he would say, what’s your favorite kind of ice cream? 
JK: 
Mine is probably strawberry. 
K: 
Strawberry. 
JKL 
I don’t like chocolate. 
I: 
No? You don’t like chocolate? 
JK: 
No. 
I: 
At all? 
JK: 
Not at all. 
I: 
Oh, my. Very unusual person. 
LP: 
[Laughing]. 
I: 
How ‘bout you? 
LP: 
I like Heavenly Hash. That’s my favorite. 
I: 
Heavenly Hash [laughing]. So, in the last few minutes, what would you like to tell the world? You know, 
what have I missed? I’m sure there are questions I should have been asking that I didn’t ask. And what would 
you love to tell everybody? 
JK: 
Basically, you know, if you want to work in a career that, you know, a rewarding career and stuff where 
you can actually make a difference [3.47] and stuff, this would definitely be a career to get into. 
I: 
Thank you. How ‘bout you? 
LP: 
This career field needs good, compassionate people. People who love people, and not just people who 
come to work and do their job. People who will build relationships with the people that they care for because 
everybody needs that. Relationships are, you know, one of the foundations of life, and people need that even 
when they’re elderly. They need that love and that, you know, person that cares for them not just takes care of 
them, but actually cares for them. So. 
I: 
And in addition to the higher wages, training, benefits, all of that, what would help you? What would be 
helpful to you to be successful in this career choice? 
JK: 
Sometimes you don’t get, you know, the best working equipment that you need.  Sometimes you have 
to use a lift on somebody and the lift’s not working properly or, you know, something like that. Sometimes you 
have to do blood pressures and take vitals and stuff like that, and you the equipment that you have doesn’t 
work properly, but that’s what you’re given, so you have to find a way to make it work. Better equipment would 
definitely be a plus in this career field. 
LP: 
Yeah. 
I: 
Anything you can think of?

21
LP: 
No, but I would agree with that. Better equipment, you know, more training, more genuine people who 
care. 
I: 
How ‘bout you mentioned a sense of community, and we earlier were talking about the fact that there’s 
no Association that you—you know, there’s not group that you can affiliate with. 
LP: 
Right. There’s not. 
I: 
And you would find that helpful? 
LP: 
I would, yup. You know, better education for the public, so, you know, people know what we actually do 
for a living and how important it is. 
I: 
And how would a professional association like that help you, personally? 
LP: 
I think that it would help, you know, get the name out there so we can, you know, and not just the 
name, but the, you know, the career out there, so that we can, you know, attract more skilled and 
compassionate and caring people to this career field, because it’s—you know, you’re always gonna need 
people. This career field is not going anywhere. You always have to— 
JK: 
It’s a career that— 
LP: 
It’s life-long. 
JK: 
--machines can’t take over.  
LP: 
Yup. 
JK:  
I meant there’s [.47] things that machines can’t do that have to be done in this type a career, and— 
I: 
You don’t want a machine giving you a bath? 
JK: 
No. 
I: 
Or changing your catheter? 
LP: 
[Laughing] right. 
I: 
No? 
LP: 
Not really. 
I: 
No. Not really. I don’t know many people that would. 
LP: 
Yeah. 
I: 
So, those are all of the questions I have for you. I’m going to close this again by saying thank you to 
you for this interview, but also for doing this valuable work that you’re doing. 
LP: 
You’re welcome. 
I: 
I think it’s a privilege to be able to talk with you and hear your stories. 
LP: 
Thank you. 
JK: 
Thank you. 
I: 
Thank you so much.
