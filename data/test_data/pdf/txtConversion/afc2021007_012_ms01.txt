whatever one wants.  Fishing longline openers west of Dutch Harbor “the big 
city” 
 
35:00-40:00 
Dutch Harbor continued.  Wild place, getting food, having fun going out.  Elbow

IFQ unfair transfer of wealth from open fishery to something owned.  North 
Pacific Fisheries Management Council.   Fishermen fighting against halibut and 
black cod IFQ program.  Fighting crab rationalization, crews left out as 
stakeholders.  Boat owners get quota, fishermen left out. Concern about 
fisheries being privately owned.  Access rights can be inherited, non-fishermen 
can control access to fisheries.  Communities, deckhands and future fishermen 
not included as stakeholders.  Red king crab fishery closed despite 
rationalization. Fisherman covers all costs and 80% of profit goes to resource 
owner.  Safety, less money for boat maintenance getting only 20% of catch 
profits.  Danger in crabbing driven by increased participation in response to 
concern fishery would be rationalized. 
 
55:00-60:00 
Fishing for History kills people, Scandies Rose running in bad weather to 
participate in fishery for fishing history.  Slowing down fishing after IFQ’s makes 
it safer.  But giving away access rights forever not good.  Halibut fishing 
communities pushed out of the halibut fishery.  Open access, crew can work, 
save money buy boat and participate.  
 
1:00-1:05:00 Giving access to processors presented as “community” Becoming better long line 
fishermen with longer season, better businesses higher quality.  Keeping up with 
skill set, baiting gear fast.

1:35-1:39:42 Values in fishing life, hard work, physically pushed beyond limits, not knowing 
what capable of, fishing shows you.  Learning about people you work with, 
learning about people.  How we choose to do things, the way we choose to do 
our jobs define us gaining friends you can depend on.  Fishing friends as brothers 
and sisters.  Giving up stability for deeper experiences, Having a cup of coffee in 
the middle of the ocean on a fishing boat as unique experience.
