2012/2013 
Came to HRH 
 
 
Looking for places that were medical and 
gave the same attention as her work in El 
Salvador 
34:06 
Dr. Raphael Cantara (GYN from 
the Dominican Republic)  
He helped her to get work at HRH. He 
worked at HRH with Comite Latino (to 
educate new immigrants about health 
center) 
36:19 
Promotora 
She wanted to be a promotora. She 
talked with the priest and he told me 
don’t talk about family planning 
36:59 
Family planning 
We are going to respect your beliefs. She 
knew from Salvador about family 
planning.  
38:09 
Church 
Only went to the church to get more 
promoters 
39:00 
Promoters 
She worked in Peekskill.  
40:00 
Who were the communities you 
were trying to reach?  
Whole families  
Visited families and they don’t have time.  
 
 
The work here can be more difficult 
 
41:00 
How did you go about visiting 
families 
Visiting the families. Found families in the 
park or on the street rather than door to 
door. Or people she knew already. Then 
she would go to the home.  
41:44 
New Immigrant 
New immigrant family Spanish speaking 
families  
42:17 
 
Works directly with Spanish people about 
visiting the clinic. Make them feel safe 
 . 
43:37 
Health is for everybody 
Don’t have papers and are scared to 
come to the clinic if they are sick. Having 
someone who speaks Spanish makes it 
easier. And the clinic accepts everybody  
- 
44:00 
Accompany to health center 
She would bring people to the center. Put 
them in contact with Raphael or Myrna. 
46:00 
Places to find people 
Parks and streets. Who someone who 
talks a lot and likes to work with people.  
 
Choosing promotoras 
People who like to talk with people, found 
some from her ESL class 
47:43 
 
Family by family, home by home. Specific 
places depend on the people. She walks 
around. On the bus.  
48:35 
Promotoras 
Encouraged to reach out to people in 
their own networks and as the go through 
life (Vilma) At events and such, wherever 
they feel comfortable working and talking.  
49:16 
Outside of Peekskill 
Easier to find people  
49:45  
Never had health care 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Success in reaching someone 
getting treatment 
 
 
Follow up 
How do you get people who have never 
had health care to trust you? 
She found someone who was sick but 
had never gone to a clinic. The woman 
talked with Dolores who told her she 
needed to go to the clinic. Not sure if she 
would come. Women with GYN problems 
feel scared and embarrassed and don’t 
want to talk with anyone.  
 
Deloros has found that some people will 
go back to their country if they feel sick 
rather than seek help here.  
 
In one case a man was very appreciative 
of getting his wife help 
 
 
Deloros likes to follow up and see what 
happens 
54:49 
When she started 
She went to the Deli and he told me he 
had a problem with his wife. Comite 
Latino is the first step to connecting 
 . 
56:36 
Trust 
People are looking for someone to trust 
and help them. Listens and pays 
attention. 
58:13 
What does it take to be a 
promotora 
A promotora, it has to come from both the 
heart and the head. It is something 
natural within someone 
 
 
 
 
 
Trusted network 
 
 
 
Accepting of people and not 
being judgmental 
Vilma noted that Deloros hands her 
people off to someone else that can be 
trusted.  
Warm hand to warm hand 
Building and keeping trust includes being 
a part of the community. 
 
 
Have to be open hearted and non 
judgmental. 
 
Promotor is someone the community 
trusts and is a leader. And is there even 
when the weather is bad.  
1:03:13 
What were the community groups 
you were a part of in Peekskill 
where you found people.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Can you talk about what you did 
on the board 
Community groups that Dolores connects 
to:  
 
 
ESL, church, Comite Latino (community 
driven) fitness classes 
 
Dolores is also a member of the SunRiver 
board of directors from 2013 to 2021 
representing the immigrant community on 
the board.  
 
Spoke in Albany.  
 
Sometimes she was scared to speak 
because she doesn’t think her English is 
good enough 
1:07:29 
Home Health Aid 
She also does that. She is working with 
an Italian man right now.  
1:08:02 
Professional 
She likes to be professional - it gives her 
confidence 
1:09:23 
Experience 
She brings all of her abilities to the table 
1:11:23 
What are the primary health 
issues in Peekskill 
People are scared. More issues around 
mental health. The diet is also not good - 
 . 
too much sugar, fast food. Nutrition is the 
biggest problem she has found. Big 
difference in what food is available to 
them. Don’t teach the kids to eat 
vegetables or fruit. In El Salvador they 
have chickens, and cows and plant their 
own vegetables, which cannot be done 
here.  
 
Dolores doesn’t like canned food. Better 
to have it fresh. She learned in nutrition 
about using soya beans and other foods. 
 
1:18:45 
Community Training about Food 
How to prepare the food that is available. 
She learned how to make soya meat.  
 
A university came and explained how to 
make the food. And how to read the 
labels on food.  
1:21:27 
Connecting individuals to 
services that are not health 
services i.e. housing 
It is all connected, water, health, 
plumbing, it all connected. 
As a promotora you have to keep your 
eyes open and be able to refer people to 
other services 
1:25:19 
Another problem  
In El Salvador, everyone walks. Here 
people don’t exercise. There are walking 
groups at the different sites.  
1:30:00 
Food in El Salvador as opposed 
to here. 
More food insecurity here than in El 
Salvador because they were farmers 
1:30:45 
Promotoras work alongside of 
charities 
Depends on their social networks.  
1:32:25 
 
Finding out the needs and problems. 
1:33:49 
Board of directors 
Brings all of her experiences to bear on 
solutions
