Born in Queens, New York, a “city boy.” Family moved to Long Island for a 
better environment in 1955 (he was born 1950). “Moving to heaven.” 
(01:01).Three generation household; Grandmother was his “real Mom.” 
Grandmother came from England; her brother was a homesteader on Long 
Island, built his own house; raised their own animals, food.  Grandmother 
canned vegetables and saved seeds. Longed to live in Canada. Did well in 
school and parents decided he should go to college. Went to Johnson State 
College and majored in education. Knew early on he didn’t want to be a 
teacher. Wanted to be outside and work with the land. Got to know dairy 
farmers near him. They had everything he wanted, had an understanding of 
the earth, access to this ancient knowledge—“thought of them of as modern 
day Native Americans who had an ethical connection to nature that I really 
wanted to be part of.”[4:28].

When finished school, he had an opportunity to care take a farm. Parents 
disappointed he wasn’t using his education the way they intended. But said 
he wanted to be happy and do what he wanted. Had been active in anti war 
movement and became more and more angry with it. His brother was

drafted and said it was complete insanity—go to jail or to Canada. He had 
pulled 95 so was going.  Showed how to get 4F. AT that point he realized he 
was becoming what he was fighting against and he had to do something 
different—farm and food really came into focus. Let me be outside and was 
doing something good for people. Caretook the farm for 7 years. Wanted to 
do it organically. His mother’s sister was attuned to negative effects of 
pesticides and herbicides.  Tried to find current resources and ended up 
having to go to books of the late 18th century and 19th century for answers. 
Extension service didn’t have the knowledge. Stayed 7 years on that farm 
and “learned of how to lose money on every form of agriculture you could 
imagine.” [7:25]. Found a niche in raising turkeys—successful, selling to 
restaurants, farmer’s markets, etc. Then decided he wanted to live in a yurt, 
farm with oxen and do it the old way. But realized he couldn’t ever have a 
place of his own to raise a family judging by the numbers. Had found a 
couple of plots of land he wanted to buy but ended up not being able to 
afford them. Finally found current space, worked with local banks, and it 
worked. Didn’t have the numbers they were looking for but was advocated 
for by a member of the board. Got a mortgage for the land; lived in a teepee 
for 2 ½ years, worked as a carpenter part time, too. Working with another 
friend at this point. Friend came from New York and fell in love with 
Vermont and moved here.

Greg asked about large community of young people during the 70s. He came 
to Rutland by accident. Burlington exciting but farming opportunities near 
Wallington. VT on “War wheat” farm (WWII). 100 acres, had to learn 
everything on how to do animals and pruning, sugaring, etc. Probably 
unrealistic but strong and energetic so wanted to do everything by hand. 
Learned to sythe, collect hay loose, and collected sap using oxen while a 
mentor made the syrup. Finally learned that the men who settled Vermont 
were “twice the mean they were.” “We don’t really understand what work

is. But they also drank a lot of alcohol to ease their pain [14:43]” (Laughs). 
Wallingford a happenstance. Looks back at parents and grandmother who 
taught him to act on an opportunity. Paid rent to himself so had enough 
money to put down payment on a farm.  Doesn’t exist today—then, prime 
land was $500 and acre, and costs so much more now.  Better markets now 
but access to land has become so restricted. Loves the Intervale for its 
generating access. 
 
Access changes for young 
farmers 
 
16:33 – 23:40 
Dreams to have a Rutland-based interval “but Rutland is such a tight 
community. You can make anything happen [16:59] “if you have a good 
idea.”  Sense of pride, a wonderful farmer’s market with 100 vendors  and 
only one in the state that runs 52 straight weeks, every Wednesday, every 
Saturday. Important for Rutland economy. But they have access issues too 
with boutique land prices. Has noticed a trend in young people today, 
though, who are very well educated and choosing agriculture “because it 
fills that hole in our soul.” [18:30]. He has apprentices and picks those with 
work ethic and smarts and ability to make it. Offer them use of land, 
markets, infrastructure, equipment, free of charge and can stay there as 
long as they can find a place of their own land. Proud of that. Five local 
farmers who have come through Boardman Hill. Some people see that he’s 
raising his own competition but 5 to 7% of food dollar spent locally so 93% 
opportunity. He doesn’t want to get bigger so he help other farmers get 
started. It becomes “more in the frontal lobe of everyone’s 
consciousness”[19:53] about farm stands.  He’s 65 and many others are too, 
so need young farmers. First goal of group in Vermont Farmers Food Center 
is purchasing a 3-acre industrial property and rebuilding the necessary 
infrastructure for agriculture. Used to be in down town Rutland with largest 
aggregation facility in the state (40s and early 50s) for agricultural products 
that went to NYC and Boston by train. Second goal is encouraging young 
farmers to replace aging ones. “We view part of Vermont’s future as

containing pieces from its past.”[21:57] and working on VT Farmers’ Food 
Train which will bring Rutland County food to NYC and bring money back 
and seafood (that we don’t have in Vermont). Working with VRans. Would 
love it to be by rail but may be hard at the beginning. MP from Canada 
wanted to do overnight train from Montreal to New York City stopping in 
Rutland, to connect a card and take vegetables to New York.  
23:40 – 29:24 
Trucking seems the way to start it though. July 5 unveiling plans for new 
aggregation distribution facility designed for the project all designed pro 
bono. Also Farmers Hall where winter farmers ’market runs. Can be used 
for all kinds of events. Enterprise launched by him, Paul Horton, Bill Clark, 
young farmers. “Act of planting a seed in the grown is an act of faith; but it’s 
an action [26:19]” Farmers don’t want to plan things or have meetings, or 
discuss or do surveys, etc., they want to DO action”[26:29]. Combination of 
older farmers have developed their business and new farmers. Find good 
markets that are within reach. Conduit between producers and consumers. 
System has to be developed. Box is 24 lettuce heads; not 20 large ones.

29:24 –32:41 
Rutland has many small farms. Develop a certain standard, then aggregate 
crops for quality so a better handle on it. Similar to many cooperative 
models. Theirs is non-profit model, wants to grow farmers, markets and 
efficiency. One idea to share commercial kitchen. Now have the building 
that they’d need. Looking at rebuilding a future food system. Bigger markets 
encourage growth--need medium sized farms to access the markets. 
How it works 
32:41 – 40:06 
Greg asked What’s next?  When he bought current property was a dairy 
farm, lots of corn, need a rest. Cover crops, cut, then cover crops again. 
Organic. Then built a barn in 1985 and sold to restaurants and camps and 
wholesalers (mixed vegetables). Leafy greens, basil, tomatoes, things that 
can be supplied on a regular basis. Then went to farmer’s market with only 
greens and spinach, then added different items. Moved away from 
restaurants. Farmers’ markets, farm stands, rented a piece of property in

center Rutland. Added flowers early in the season. Worked hard at farm 
stand, grew vegetables, got a little burned out laughs]. Open 7 days a week 
Worked 9 to 6 plus farming and farmers’ markets, but hard work. Wife is his 
rock. She picks up all the pieces that he drops,  2 daughters and a son. Work 
ethic has to reign. Son is farmer in waiting and runs crew in the summer 
even though he’s only 18. Wife (Gaye) has some income now. Wife got full 
time job to get access to healthcare for him as he needed 2 knee 
replacements. 
 
Family and importance of 
work ethic 
 
Family’s support 
40:06 –41:06 
A good friend of theirs told her she couldn’t turn the job down.” Farmers 
work til they die.”[40:12] Retirement is a concept made for people who 
don’t like what they’re doing.[40:30] Couldn’t stop—it’s his passion. 
Another organism out in the field.

41:06 – 50:44 
Greg asked him to describe what was here (Boardman Hill) now. 80 acres, a 
great place with amazing history. Timothy Boardman a ship’s carpenter, 
Oliver Cromwell; settled there. Built house, deacon at local church. He 
raised food, active in the community. First son was Elijah ( Mr. Cox’s dog’s 
name). He took such good care of the land. 1789 addition has a beam with 
Elijah’s name on it—a sense of place. When he first visited, grasses five feet 
stall, dear, blackbirds, etc. A piece of paradise. Only 4 miles from downtown 
Rutland. Had to work around killdeer and became part of the land. Sense of 
place is awesome—makes him really happy. Usually farms 10 to 15 acres 
depending the year, crew, weather. Field tunnels, can grow food year round. 
Greens 52 weeks a year. When peepers go into the fall, and encounters 
freezing and turn into a compound and come back to life. Large field tunnels 
can grow later. Spinach, chard, Kale, mustard greens, get to 80% maturity 
and then finish the rest. Plants in the ground. Plants freeze solid but pull 
them out of second later, respiration rates really low so they don’t turn 
bitter as they might to reproduce. Quality is great. Bench top crops also. 
Does baby arugula and baby spinach. People love fresh greens in the winter.

Greens have been excellent. If you create an economic opportunity, 
someone will fill it. For example, started winter market. They just did it. 
Good venue for Vermont crops, cheeses, yogurts, veggies, etc. Young 
farmers doing CSAs and veggies for winter market—beans, corn, etc. and 
freeze them and sell later. Opportunities to do it differently. People want 
choice. Winter market has 86 vendors.

Greg asked why do separate group rather than joining an existing group. 
Farmers tend to expand the envelope all the time, working their way 
through it, and understanding there’s so much that can be done. Want 
organization in the field who can understand the process. So older farmers 
and new ones together. Infrastructure is always lacking. Where is it when it 
used to be here. There’s so much that can be done. The organization is often 
comprised of outsiders. Keep thinking about various ideas, new ways to 
rearrange them.  Identity and market critical. Bottleneck in VT meat 
industry is cut and wrap, not in slaughter. Facility makes a huge difference. 
Working relationships with professional meat cutters who will teach 
farmers how to do special cuts. When everything is on site and storage 
facility, processing facility, etc. Energy. Young farmers don’t usually have 
the expensive facilities they need. He has a commercial kitchen because he’s 
been doing it for a long time. “Value added.” 
Food organization and 
different foci.

He and his wife do dilled green beans, pickled patty pan, “diddlehead .” Now 
can’t make commercial food in family kitchen. Legal regs get in the way. His 
grandmother said “you should go through life and treat everything with 
respect and reverence and let the tally show at the end that you have given 
more than you received.”[01:07:34]. “that’s a full life.” She was the brightest 
star in my life.”[1:07:44].  There are no self made men or women. We’re all a 
product of our environment and happenstance. Dealt hand: white, male, 
middle class in US, supportive family, great education and ability to 
recognize opportunity and act on it. None of that came from me. [01:08:19].

Some families damage children; some don’t. Agricultural parallel; Organic 
ag is management (“feed the soil, not the plant”); then conventional ag: 
mining operation and war fare to force the issue. Biodynamic ag., 
incorporating farm as ecosystem, a relationship of organisms. Degree of 
mysticism= ancient knowledge. Native Americans knew and people like Bill 
Clark. They are part of a system but not in control. He is biodynamic to a 
certain degree. Comes close to ritual. About involvement and attention to 
detail. “Control is an illusion: happiness is a choice.”[091:11:51] Need to 
become a part of it not in control of it. You can feel when it’s right.

Greg asked some details: do you house people on site. Answer: yes. 
Currently two young women and one 35-year-old man. They find him. That 
the base for future farmers for Rutland. Young couple in a tent now living in 
a tent, amazing young women who is “liquid.” [01:14:07] filling up “any 
vessel and take on its shape.” Program in Rutland: food is medicine; “health 
is a nutrient based system not a script based system.” Serving new farmers 
and people with food related illnesses. Put together program, primary 
physician screened for appropriateness of patients with some difficulty 
related to food, but no drugs :free food and food education. Paid young 
farmers on CSA model to give crops to the ill people. Youthworks, a faith 
based org. comes into Rutland, two days a week, one in the fields to help, 
one at the food center Kitchen, guests cooking, doing food demonstrations, 
etc. so patient group can go home with food, recipes and hopefully an ability 
to make some changes..

Greg asked about RAFFL: a couple, India Burnett Farmer, student, and Andy 
Farmer who was interning there, along with Tara Kelly, who was working at 
Planning Commission noticed agriculture is mentioned in all town plans but 
without action plans.  A couple of others farmers started meeting with them 
to address those issues.  Started as winter farmers’ market but outgrew 
before it opened. Parking not available, no visibility. Bill Clark said we need

a place of our own. They had to keep moving. Got a NOFA grant to find a 
site, decided to spend $3000 on feasibility study. RAFFL wanted no part of 
project, too big and had to resign as conflict of interests. Couldn’t be a 
501©3.  Had had vender tax prior which accumulated $10,000. Farmer’s 
market said okay. Arduous process. By-laws. Got 501©3 easily.

Greg asked Why Rutland. When he first moved to Wallingford he went 
through Rutland and noted it was pretty run-down, doesn’t look like 
Vermont. Lots of plastic facades on buildings—then they came down and 
are beautiful buildings. Rutland is real—and very conservative. Blue collar, 
Catholic, and can-do. They want their kids to have it better than they did. 
Some young farmers and other young people moved back from Burlington. 
Can make anything happen in Rutland if you have a good idea. People want 
to listen and become part of things. Has become known at food mecca. 
Why Rutland 
 
Rutland as place of action, 
sincerity, blue collar, and 
real.

The lost industrial jobs aren’t coming back. Agriculture will fill a lot of those 
jobs. New market tax credits. Food Center called purest form of economic 
development interviewer had come across. Jobs follow dollars. Food is 
important, what we have now is making us sick. Growing agriculture and 
reestablishing markets has potential. Drugs always linked to poverty. That’s 
everywhere. Agriculture employs a lot of people. Great opportunity now. 
There used to be a creamery in every community. All the little stores will 
happen again. They have to. Will provide own source of seed. No limits. 
People keep asking if food is organic. Add: he does this for selfish reasons: 
he has children and lives in the community. This will remain heaven. And is 
in Community Land Trust. Wants a good economic health for the 
community for his children.  Need to make sure we provide for our kids and 
have a quality of life that is passed on to them. Sees their lives at risk. Have 
to get out of ourselves.
