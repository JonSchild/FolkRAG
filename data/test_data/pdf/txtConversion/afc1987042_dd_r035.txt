P:  ...most people.  When I was up in Vermont we were reorganizing the CC Camp back in 1940, 
41.  I remember one time I was staying in this house, the name of Jim Farnham.  And one of his 
helpers came in and said, Jim, that storm last night, he said, we lost two maple trees two of the 
sugar trees.  Jim said, which one?  Now there's a whole big forest, this guy explained exactly the 
two trees, and Farnham new every tree in that forest.  And he knew the two that he had lost.  
F:  So that man had dialog with his environment.
P:  Well you go here, look it, you go along here.  What's that?  That's a tree.  It's not a, it's not a 
Beech tree, it's not an Oak tree, it's a tree.  All right.  Once you start getting more knowledge, 
now you're talking about a Pine tree, you're talking about a Beech tree, you're talking about an 
Oak tree, you're talking about a Hickory tree, you're talking about a Chestnut tree, you're talking 
about all of those particular types of trees that are around there.  And, and what had happened in 
Lowell is that the canals didn't even have names.  It's like giving your kid, not having any (--)  
How the hell can you have a dialog with a community when you had five and six, tens of miles 
of canals, and you had seven canals.  People didn't even know, they didn't put a name to it.
MA:  There are no local names for the canals?
P:  Well they had them, but see, this one here, the Merrimack Canal, I had a bet with someone.  I 
said, look it.  I bet we can go back, this is going right down behind the high school.  This one 
canal here.  (MA:  Umhm)  I said, I bet we can get all of your honor roll students for the last 
twenty-five years and say, you went four years to Lowell High School.  Behind Lowell High 
School was a canal.  What was the name of the canal?  And I bet 5% of them couldn't tell you.  
MA:  But did they have their own way of referring to it?
P:  No, they didn't even give it a name for cripe sake.  This is how disassociated people can come
from their environment.  Now, if they went to Ottawa, they would tell you the canal in front of 
the city hall in Ottawa.  Why?  Because people put a value on it.  People, they put a value on it, 
they put a name on it.  And they show a relationship to it.  So it's these relationships and 
connections.
D:  Okay.  I've put on the tape recorder already because I didn't want to miss that.  But let me 
just, so it's on there, say that today is November the 5th and we're talking with Pat Mogan and 
Mary Hufford, Paul Marion and Doug DeNatale.  I'm going to stop the tape right here.  
P:  ...how can you, how can you use it?  
MA:  Okay.  What I'm having to (--)  Okay, what I hear you saying is that you'd like to somehow 
get people, raise people's awareness of their environment, get them to appreciate and value it 
more.  And, and you think by involving the Harvard people this would, would help?
P:  I would say that if you take any ethnic group at all that was in the city, a great part of their life
was planting and growing things.  In fact most of them grew their own vegetables and the like, 
and they, and the like.  So their lifestyle is very closely associated with nature.  
MA:  Yes.  See, these aren't the people, they're not the ones you are saying are disassociated, 
disassociated.  They're (--)
P:  Their progeny is.
MA:  Okay.
M:  What Pat is saying is that (P:  Their progeny is) the contemporary people in Lowell right 
now for the most part do not have a dialog with their landscape.
P:  They don't realize how smart their ancestors were.
MA:  Okay (chuckles).  
P:  Yeah, yeah.
M:  And also the symbolic meaning of you know, certain plants and trees and so forth.  You 
know, just like you're saying, those people transplanted from the swamps, those birch trees 
because it reminded them of home.  
MA:  So the people from the [unclear] Botany Department could help to make that link, when we
had them coming in.
P:  Yes it could.  In other words, the things that they have to do, no matter what the hell their 
objectives are, it could fit in here. And where they could have here, they could have an urban 
laboratory here.  
M:  What we're saying is research.  (P:  Research, yeah)  That would be the(--)  Well first thing is
one of the things we're still trying to establish is this ethno-botany, is it, can an interest in this 
kind of, these medicines, or whatever, or is it also this kind of larger view of the while landscape 
of different cultures.
MA:  Yeah, like the way the environment, there's a reason for the way the environment looks, 
and it's partly, and sort of the way that people thought things should look, or the values that they 
had on planting certain kinds of (--)
P:  Let me put it another way.  To show you the connection between it.  I knew Chuck Roth very 
well from the Audibon Society.  And they did an inventory of trees right in the middle of the city.
And they said, and this is in the Acre, and they said there were so many different species of trees 
in there that it couldn't be an accident.  (MA:  Wow!)  So at one time they were very oriented 
along that line right here in the city of Lowell.  So what we're doing, see, you might get, in order 
to improve the so called quality of life, you might have others like bringing in paintings of 
something else.  The Mafia could buy all of the paintings you want.  Now is that culture?  What 
we want to do is to tie it in with the people.  Associate it with their, with their lives.  
MA:  Now this is great.  I mean this is really good, because what you're talking about too, is that 
planners, people who are concern with quality of environments often don't go to the local people 
and do any [unclear].  I mean if they did [unclear] and you know, looked at (--)
P:  Uh, I'll tell you one of the things though.  If they went to them they, the people are not you, I 
told you about(--)
M:  They've lost the knowledge (--)
P:  Well not only that, those people are smart enough, they had to accommodate to get along in 
this world.  They have no reason to believe you when you say that their way of life and what they
did was important.  Like when you talk to Emmanuel, Manuel didn't know whether to trust you 
or not.  So Manuel got back in touch with me instead of these people friends of yours.  Is is all 
right for me to say this.  So, so if you go and start talking to these people, and talk about their 
inner feelings, they're very hesitant to let those out until they have a complete trust in your.  What
I'm saying is we have done work of that nature, and when the people were able to think and plan,
and have, those people went through and gave their, gave their feelings.  I say you don't have to 
reinvent that part of the wheel.  I'm saying you set up a process whereby now they can become 
more associated and add more too.  Add more too.  Like uh, the uh, the medicines that the people
used at that time, they would be afraid to talk to so called sophisticated people, because they 
think it might be a lot of voodoo.  And they might think less of them from it.  But if you had, if 
you had the Harvard school come in, and we were talking about, we're tracing this thing back, 
which turned out to be a very important thing in history, and was the basis for an awful lot of the 
drugs, synthetic drugs that we made.  They initially came from nature.  And we understand that 
your group of people at one time or other used this.  All right.  Now you put it on, you put it on a 
different level.  But most, in school when I grew up, if you asked me questions about my home 
life, you got nothing.  I was a dumb as hell.  Anyone that spoke was an idiot, because we had no 
reason to trust them.  And that's the way we grew up, because we were referred to as second 
language problems, because our folks spoke another language.  You would have to be a real idiot 
not to realize that.  So with that particular orientation, how could you, you couldn't talk.  You're 
not going to get any information, and information out of the, out of the people.  
MA:  So were you aware when you were growing up of plants being used medicinally, or having 
been used in the past?
P:  No.  No.  No, what I was aware of growing up, is I did an awful lot of planting.  We grew all 
of our own things.  I'm realizing now when I look back, how much of a chemist my family was.  
We, we knew what to do with the ashes from the stove.  We knew how to rotate crops.  
MA:  What did you grow?
P:  Everything, everything we ate.  And we kept it in a cold cellar in sand.  And, and we, we 
would grow.  We had, we had a (--)
M:  This was in Norwood?
P:  Yeah, yeah.  I just can barely remember the pigs.  But we had chickens, we had ducks, we had
geese.  On the outskirt of, on the outskirts of the town, every Irish family had a plot of land 
whereas they grew all of their potatoes and all of their other vegetables. 
M:  Oh, that's interesting.  Who owned that land?
P:  We did.  We would buy it.  Yeah, we would buy the land on the, on the outskirts.  So growing 
up as a kid I remember going up there and knocking all of the potato bugs off the plants.  You 
had to do all of that stuff.  So, so this is what, yeah, I don't know if you want to put this down.  
There's a little bit of vulgar in it.  One of the Irish wits in the town is saying, he said I never 
though I'd see the day when you could make money selling water, dirt, and horse shit.  [Laughs]  
Because all of that was so free.  But you know, we were into the transition.  Now when, before 
you got all of that stuff for nothing.  Now they want money for it.  
M:  Right.  Right.  [All laugh]  When you talked to Georgie Kepisch, and you said you know, 
what will improve the quality of life?  What's the most you can do?  And he said, you know, 
bring the forest to the city.  Was that before he had been to Lowell, or in the midst of his work 
here?
P:  Oh, he had been he had been here for quite awhile.  We used to talk periodically.  And one of 
the things he had, all of his students were, were not the average age of students.  They were all 
graduate students.  And some, a lot of them were foreigners.  And some of them were architects 
going back to school for further education.  So he had a very advanced type of, of student.
M:  What's interesting to me is that you know, in terms of quality of life, he you know, he had the
kind of a real holistic vision, not simply the health of the environment, but also the esthetics.  
Because when he talked about you know, the sound of the trees, and the look of the, of the plants
and the trees.
P:  He was talking about the chlorophyll exchange and all of that.  
M:  Yeah, right.  Yeah, but he was able, because he's an artist, he's got artistic vision too.  He was
able to think of the esthetic impact (P:  Yes!) of plants, trees, shrubs and so forth. 
P:  And like, like he was saying that you know, the sound.  Everything is so harsh, because you 
go bouncing off hard things.  There was no moderating of your, of your environment.  These are 
the things that he, he was thinking of.  But the thing is this, your big thing is that your 
community, and your town, and your city is going to do something.  Why the hell don't they do 
something according to some kind of an overall plan?  
MA:  Well see that's, that's what's interesting when you think of a place as ethnically diversed as 
Lowell.  Does everybody, you know, in developing an overall plan, how do you, how do you 
accommodate what you might have diverse preferences?
P:  All right.  It's a lot of, you can't, for people who grew up in a society where there way of life 
has been depreciated by institutions, like your government and your school, and your like, and 
you had, you were the no nothing party.  This was the strong hold of it back here, you know, in 
the early days.  When you had people that grew up with that, it's going to take them quite a bit of 
time to change from the brainwashing that they had received over the years, back to this as a new
approach, rather than the fad that's going to exist for a couple of years, and they don't want to get
caught in that vine.  Like some of them are really reinstituting the names that had changed.  This 
is how bad the thing was with some (--)
MA:  Like what?  What are some examples of that?
P:  Well I, I came across a kid.  About four or five years ago I was at some kind of a conference, 
and a guy came up to me and he said, do you remember me?  I said, vaguely, I said.  I said, I said
did it have anything to do with the golf course?  He says yeah, that's right.  He said, I came from 
East Dedham.  And I came from Norwood.  The ones from East Dedham were all Italians 
[unclear], and we from Norwood are mostly all Irish.  And I said, what's your name?  He said, 
Drinkwater.  I said, jesus, I can't place you by your name, I don't know.  Well he said, it used to 
be [Bicalacqua?], which is Drinkwater in Italian.  
M:  Oh yeah, [Bevelacqua?].  
P:  Bevelacqua.
M:  Yeah, yeah, changed to Drinkwater.  
P:  So a number of them changed their names for acceptance.  A number of them changed their 
religion for acceptance.  And now, for them to go back onto that thing, there's in as much as I am 
one that lived in doubt all the time, you know, I hardly think there was an ethnic who wasn't 
expose to your institutions that didn't at one time feel ashamed of their parents.  If they were 
listening to the message that was coming out of that, of that particular school and out of your 
history books, and the like.  However, if you had an open mind and started to question it, there 
isn't one of them that at the time, even if they had switched over and became one of the others, so
called, who didn't see things of terrific value in their own background, which no longer exist 
today that would have made life way the hell better today.  At least you live in a community.  
And a community is a group of people that have something in common.  And you had, you were 
a member of that community.  I've seen a community, say an Irish community that was a 
community, end up with just a group of individuals living there with nothing in common.  And 
so, so there's, so what's happening over the things, in these trends that are going on among the 
Blacks and the other search for roots, almost everyone is searching for roots.  In this city of 
Lowell, in spite of all of the things that happened, the uh, on your thing on trying to homogenize 
America, you take the Lafayette Club in Lowell, it's virtually all professional people.  French, 
Franco Americans.  They have banded together for the perpetuation of the French culture which 
they believe in.  And there's mostly every other ethnic, but they only, most of those only can do it
under the cover of their own roof.  They were never able to come out of the closet and come out. 
And no one has ever made the statement of the positive role that they have played in the 
development America.  That's what the Park says.  But again you have the other trend going 
toward homogenization.  So there's still an ambivalence.  There's still a certain amount, certain 
amount of contradiction.  But what, what you, what you would do is, see most people don't know
their history.  They, they, most of them would never know.  They would marvel at what Manuel 
Figuero's done in his back yard.  But they don't see his back yard.  They never, they never saw, 
they knew little about the life that I lived as, as a kid.  And their ignorance is causing them to 
repeat history rather than learn history.  And I think that's the main part I think.  
D:  To repeat history in what way.  
P:  Well for example here, you take here in the city of Lowell, wherever you find a number of 
cultural groups, because of the process we use, we always use one culture against the other 
economically.  So there was always one group in the bottom and another group on top of it. 
D:  In terms of the labor force economics?
P:  Same as the labor force.  This was sponsored, this was nurtured.  All right.  So the uh, so, 
what was the question again now?  
D:  How, how are they reliving history?
P:  All right.  Back at the time, the dominant group you might take say, in the City of Lowell now
might be, if you want to associate with one of the various ethnic groups, were the Irish in 
numbers.  [someone coughs]  Unfortunately I believe that the most intolerant group too of all of 
the groups in the city.  Now, but what they don't know is they don't know their own history.
M:  Right.  So you're saying because they aren't aware of the experiences of their grandparents 
(--)
P:  They're not even aware that in Lowell I can show you a report in 19, 1844, of the Lowell, the 
what the heck do we call it?  The annual report of the school committee at that particular, that 
particular time, when it tells about the Irish in a segregated school.  
M:  Yeah, this is the so called Lowell Plan for separate schools for the Irish. 
P:  They had a separate school, and they kept them.  They wouldn't allow them to go into the 
regular public school.  Most Irish don't know that happened.  Now they were at the bottom of the
totem pole there, and they were demanding things at that time, and they got finally, your 
numerous culture groups in the city, if they ever demanded them they would run them out of the 
city.  They demanded their own teachers.  They demanded Catholic teachers.  They gave them 
catholic teachers.  But they were still segregated.  But they don't know that has, that has 
happened.  In other words the Irish were the Puerto Ricans of the 1940's and 50's.  See, and had 
they, if they knew more about (--)  In other words, I'm saying knowledge is needed among other 
things, and also more things are needed to (--)  Like you take another thing how times have 
changed.  In order to get along in today's world, hardly, mostly all of our manufacturing was 
done in foreign countries.  So mostly all the manufact...  If you had someone is going to work in 
that sector of the economy, the chances are they're going to go to a foreign country.  So one of 
the requisites of that is a knowledge of at least another language.  All right.  Well we have known
for a long time, the research, that in order to understand your own language, no matter what it is, 
suppose it's english, you can do it much better if you had another functional language as a frame 
of reference when you are developing that.  So if we were intellectually bound, and wanted to be 
better in English, we should be making sure everyone had at least one other language.  However 
you got some people in the city that want to band every language.  You know there was a time in 
Lowell, and a time in the United States when you couldn't teach German?  And you couldn't 
teach, this was after World War II, after World War I.  You couldn't teach these languages around 
the country.  So what I'm saying is that now, but what has happened in the meantime?  There is 
no such thing as an independent country in the world today.  They're all interdependent.  Our 
way of life in the United States could not exist without the products that are coming from other 
countries, and a lot of them are third world countries.  So whether we like them or hate them, if 
we like ourselves and our way of life, we better start changing our frame of reference and 
looking at it.  That's what Lowell should be the example of.
     If we're going to go into the era of interdependence, we need one country, one city in the 
United States which recognizes the interdependence.  And they need it as a stepping stone for our
relationships with the other countries of the world.  Like with the National Park here, and this 
will come down the ethinal part of it, ethnicity part of it, we could go with the government of 
Poland and say any kind of exchange programs we have we'd like you to work them out with the 
city of Lowell.  Because the city of Lowell, through the federal government, has made the 
statement to the National Park there, recognizes the positive role of the various cultures who 
played in the development of America.  So if your programs are going anyplace, it should come 
to the city of Lowell.  We should start that interchange.  We can go, no other city could say that.  
See, this is a statement by the federal government.  This federal government is not, the 
statements made by the federal government before was to keep your people out.  
M:  See, there's a clause in the law creating the National Park in Lowell, both the National Park 
and the Preservation Commission, that says that Congress finds that the cultural heritage of many
of the peoples who came to the United States in 19th and 20th century  still exist in the 
neighborhoods of Lowell.  And it's the only National Park that has that kind of language.  (MA:  
Uh huh)  (P:  yeah)  So what they're saying is that the Lowell neighborhoods are as significant as
the Grand Canyon in terms of the city's, the country's National Cultural Resources.  So Pat is 
saying that's why it's very appropriate for Lowell to take advantage of that you know, legitimate 
role that you know, that the fact the the Congress itself has recognized what exist culturally in 
Lowell as a means of opening dialog with other countries.
P:  Sure.  You have an entree.  You have an entree to those other countries.  It's a positive. 
M:  [Clears throat]  I wanted to refer back to something you'd ask before about how do you 
ensure the planning is inclusive?  You know, when you were talking about you know, the 
ethno-botany and so forth.  You know, I think what has happened here in Lowell is an example of
if you want to call it, multicultural planning.  Like you could go over, there's a plaque on a plaza 
that's in the Acre, and it's Ecumenical Plaza.  And there's a plaque there listing the people who 
were involved both on the city side, and also from the neighborhood group at the time called 
AMNO, the Acres Model Neighborhood Organization.  And if you look at the mixture of names 
on that list, I thinks it's a, you know, it's a tangible, it's evidence of this kind of multi-cultural 
planning.  And I think even this recent exercise that we had in doing cultural plan for the city, we
had thirty-nine member group and it represented you know, all of the constituencies in the city.  I
think there's a tradition here of inclusive multicultural planning if you want to call it that.
MA:  Yeah.  I was actually though, I was just thinking of getting down to the, when you're 
designing the way that a city is going to look, how do you accommodate what might be a very 
diverse assortment of tastes.
M:  There's got to be you know, some meeting of the minds, or compromise, or whatever, or also 
in recognizing that people have their own territories too.  
MA:  Okay.  Yeah, so within the territories you could do different things.
P:  Yeah, but I would do it another way.  I would never, after years I'd never sell anything on so 
called human good.  I'd sell it on economics.  
MA:  I don't, you have to explain that for me.
P:  All right.  I would say that Lowell's greatest potential economically is it's cultural 
composition, and it's ability to merchandise that composition.  It's going to do the most for the 
most people that could possibly be done.  So if you are looking for a place where you're going to 
be able, a good place to live in, to work in, and to learn in, and to play in, you would take 
advantage of this particular thing.  So it's not, it's, and it will be more economically productive to
go down this line and open all kinds of opportunity for you as a resident of this community, to go
down this line.  And for your kids, and for their kids.  So that's the ones we're thinking of.  You 
sell that particular argument, that particular argument to them.  Like if you want to go down the 
line and take (--)
MA:  To who?  Who do you sell the argument to? 
P:  Well you, you tell the world, you tell the world what it is.  Part of it is already (--)  You just 
take the statement that is made, like Paul mentions in the National Park Legislation on what we 
are.  (MA:  Okay)  We are a multi-cultural composition, and we're proud of it, and we want to 
nurture it, we want to enhance it, we want to share it.  We want to further develop, develop that.  
So, so that's what,(--)  Now if you went down the line, wouldn't you start talking about treating 
people the way the should be treated.  There's a certain amount of confrontation implied in that, 
and a certain amount of giving up.  I say, no, forget that line.  Go down the economic line, 
everyone is going to benefit in this, this particular thing.  If you couldn't, because you're going 
down the other line, someone thinks when you're going to recognize that person, you are taking 
something from me to give to him.  And I'm saying that you are nurturing a terrific economic 
bonanza if you go down this other line.  Like when we were at the Park, when the group was 
here in the Folklife Center, and they put on the Festival, I was up in the North Common and there
was a guy sitting there with his wife, and I gather his two kids.  
M:  National Folk Festival?
MA:  National Council [unclear].
P:  National Folklife, yeah.  So I saw the guy, and I kept on looking over.  And I said, I wonder, 
he was sitting there, I'm sitting in the grass with my wife.  I said, what nationality is he?  I 
couldn't figure it out.  Then when the Irish group got on, he had a bag there.  Out of the bag he 
took [unclear] drums, and he started to play along to the music.  The guy came from New Jersey. 
He had to come here to feel at home.  This is why(--)  Now there are people like that all over the 
United States, and no one has looked upon that.  In other words, the Federal Government has 
made a statement of the validity of cultures.  I don't know whether they believed it or not, but it 
was the right thing to say.  But that right thing to say, which came out in the law in 1972, was 
written into our plan about four or five years before, exactly the same words.  
     Let me go back here, and I found this thing here.  Talking about how, how some people don't 
learn from history.  You can either learn from history, or repeat history.  This is, this is from the 
1844 Annual Report of the Lowell School Committee.  I'm reading from the bottom of this.  "At 
the present time, March 1844, we have one grammar school and five primaries composed 
exclusively of Irish children.  Now let me read.  The committee thinks the advantages of this 
arrangements, thus having the Irish separate, must have been obvious to every observer in the 
improved condition and respectability of these children and in their redemption form intellectual 
and moral degradation.  In the first settlement of the town, owing to several causes, the Irish 
were collected and built their dwellings chiefly in one quarter on a track of land familiarly 
known to all by the name of the Acre.  A large population was here gathered, destitute of nearly 
every means of moral and intellectual improvement so generally enjoyed in New England.  At 
the Annual Town Meeting in May 1930, and article was inserted in the [Warren?] for the 
appointment of a committee to consider the expediency of establishing a separate school for the 
Irish population.  The sum of 50 dollars was appropriated for the establishment and maintenance 
of a separate school district for the Irish.  It was first done, associated with the church.  Now, get 
this, here was the first municipal regulation relating to this matter.  And the origin of the 
separation between the two races."
MA:  Races.
P:  Races!  (M:  Umhm)  Now if the Irish new (--)
MA:  What year was that?
P:  1844.  If the Irish in this town new that they weren't even considered part of the White race 
(--)
End of tape R035
Begin Tape R036
P:  ...relating to this matter.  And the origin of the separation between the two races."  (MA:  
Races)  Races!  (M:  Umhm)  Now if the Irish new(--)
MA:  What year was that?
P:  1844.  If the Irish in this town new that they weren't even considered part of the White race, 
they'd be very careful on how they're referring to some of the other people.  And also, there's 
another thing too.  A lot of the things you hear talked about.  You want to study anyone who 
understand history, let them read the history of Germany, and how, and how that, that [unclear] 
race supremeority concept was developed under you know, eventually by, you know, taken over 
by Hitler and what it did to that particular group.  They will find out they are repeating history 
again.  So, so I think that, that the telling of the complete story is needed for the, for the whole 
country, but now what you do is to make an environment that reflects the value and the dignity of
those people.  And if you're going to have trees, for cripe sake, put a Polish tree in it.  Put a 
Greek tree in it.  Put a French tree.
MA:  Do you know any examples of, could you, what are some, are you aware of any, like what 
a Greek tree, or a Polish tree would be?
P:  No.
MA:  I mean I'm sure there are examples, and I was just curious.
P:  There were, there were some, I imagine there were some trees that were almost basic to other 
countries, and you might have, you might have an oak tree that has a variation that happens to 
grow in Poland.  But see, in the Boston Public Gardens years ago they used to have every tree, 
and every tree used to have a legend on it.  And the people that walked by knew what those, what
those trees, what those were.  But now we're talking about a different thing.
D:  Here's a dilemma for us.  When you talk about, on the one hand the issue of ethnic heritage, 
and traditions, and culture, and recognizing the value of that, and then the, on the other hand the 
problem of a pluralistic society in which in order to have a single society, some of those values 
have got to be integrated somehow.  If you look at a situation like the 1840's, where the Irish 
were segregated into a separate school, you could have people arguing on the one hand, but that 
keeps them from assimilating into the greater society, or you could have people arguing on the 
other hand that by having a separate Irish Institution, it becomes a way to preserve Irish Cultural 
Heritage and all of that.  This is a dilemma that we constantly find ourselves in.  Which side of 
the fence you know, do we fall in.   What, how, do you see that as a dilemma at all?  How would 
you analyze that?
P:  I'll repeat it again.
M:  I was just going to say, maybe think of you know, Mico Kaufman, the sculptor, who lives in 
Tewksbury, and who was very well known in this area, and he's Romanian, right Pat?  (P:  Yeah) 
And he was in the, I believe he was in concentration camp as a kid, (P:  he was, yeah) and things 
like that.  Mico very strongly opposed sort of this sense of reinforcing people's nationalism, or 
ethnic identity, or ethnic identity, let me put it that way.  You know, his idea is you come here you
become American.  He said, because he says that what he witnessed at his experience is that this 
kind of people's commitment to their own heritage, or nation, was a disadvantage when it came 
time to say like, you know, fight in World War II, that kind of thing.  You know he, he feels that 
in order to have a strong you know, national identity and national defense even, you know, that 
this business of encouraging people's ethnic identity is dangerous because it waters down their 
commitment to the national identity, which is, which is very interesting and a very different kind 
of position.  
P:  But that, that's a base, remember you're talking about someone that came from a nationalistic 
country that didn't have the diversity, and they didn't want it, they didn't want the diversity there. 
But your history of the United States has been (--)  If you go and read the history of J. Edgar 
Hoover, when he was looking for agents for the FBI, he took them mostly out of Catholic 
Colleges, because those were your super Americans.  And in World War II, your history of that 
(--)
MA:  They also learned to grow up and be sneaky [laughs].  [Unclear]
P:  Yeah, I mean those were your super, your super Americans.  If you look at your volunteering 
for your armies, and everything else, and where they came from (M:  the Super Patriots), they 
were the super Patriots in the, in the thing.  So what, what you're doing is this.  Like suppose at 
one time you have a group of people that were going very nationalistic.  (M:  Umhm)  If they 
were going nationalistic to the extent, it means that they are homogenizing towards one group, 
which is one group in the thing.  What group is it going to be?  And once you do that you're 
going to deny an awful lot of the others.  So you're never going to have any harm.  But there is, 
there's a basic principal of social history that there are more similarities among cultural groups 
than differences, but the differences stand out first.  People never go into them far enough to find
the similarities.  And I think that's where the strength (--)  In other words, here we're coming 
down to a little(--)  That dilemma that you're talking about, the dilemma expressed by the federal
government, because the federal government is saying that we now recognize that the diversity 
here in American folklife has contributed greatly to the cultural richness of the nations, and has 
fostered a sense of individuality and identity among the American people.  All right?  A lot of 
scholars are saying that.  So what you have is to a degree, the other, is the orientation and the 
brain washing that was done by the institution of education,in saying that if you, if you are not 
this, of this particular background, we have to train you to bring you over into that particular 
orientation.  And so that, that's part of the dilemma.
M:  I think part of the answer too to what you're saying is that, and what I would sort of get from 
Pat, is that we need a more sophisticated educational process that can accommodate both having 
someone educated as a part of the mainstream culture, but also be a person who has a sense of 
his own heritage and identity.  And (--)
D:  Let me perceive this a little bit.
P:  All right.  There's an awful lot of work done.  And one of the best overall treatises of it was 
William O. Reischower, the former Ambassador of Japan, towards the 21st Century education in 
the changing world.  And he's talking about the comparative approach to education.  We're 
talking about, and that's what we're talking about here.  The more you know about the, about the 
various cultures, the more similarities they're going to find.  We know that.  But the thing is, the 
general, maybe the general public doesn't, doesn't know that.  And but how do you (--)  Now to 
go onto that philosophical thing would take maybe another 200 years to go down, because you 
have other scholars that say, like uh, like the Head of the Carnegie Foundation, Ernest Moyer, 
now the former U.S. Commissioner of Education.  His thesis is that we are being jolted into the 
era of interdependence.  We're more, we're more, we're more residence of the world, than we are 
of, this is where the thing comes back.  Again the same argument.  Once you make the people 
different, they are not going to be the residence of any one big, big global system.  So you have 
people who are talking about their avenue to it, reinforcing the homogenization thing, which 
denied the people as being a part of it.  They have set up a hierarchy, and this one on the top and 
all the rest down the, there's no need of reliving through that particular thing.  Because the only 
thing you're going to get out of that is an awful lot of chaos.  But the big, the thing, my argument 
is this, I wouldn't go into that part.  I would go into the things that are going to improve the 
quality of the life of the people here.  And there's, and when they, if someone wanted to do some 
history on the thing in the plant, and they got a tree there, a Polish tree.  What's the connection 
between this Polish tree, and that French tree, and that Greek tree?  Someone could say, you 
know, with those three trees, all right, they extract different types of things from that.  This is 
what they did in this place.  This is what, in other words they're going to take an awful lot of 
detail scholarly work to start, but you have the mechanism, you have the mechanism to do it.  
Because I think you will find an awful lot more commonness in that, in nature.  
MA:  But you know, you also could end up with, you could end up say if you started from 
another direction and you took, just take, take the whole Urban Plan, just go at all the Urban 
Plans, I mean you might find certain plans that have different meanings for the different groups.  
You know, that you could have like this [unclear], that tree of heaven which is a, which is a real 
weed tree, but, and it came from China.  And different people may have sort of different ways of 
relating to that one tree, which would be (--)
P:  You get a sophisticated person, and they could walk through a community.  And from the 
plants and the like they'll tell you what group is living there.  Because I've had that, and I've had 
them coming to Lowell.  Now if you had in this community here, and you fostered plant life, and
you had, you had flower boxes on the houses, there's, if a person wanted to associate their 
identity in some kind of a plant expression with their background, they could do it. 
MA:  See, I think if you'd want to also look at like ethno-botany, I mean you want to look at how 
broad a scope you want to have, but for some groups plastic flowers are preferable.  You know, 
maybe preferable in certain settings to like living ones.  And that would be like (--)
D:  Well let me try taking it (--)
M:  You won't find a plastic flower on your outside.  
MA:  Yeah, not here maybe.  I haven't seen any, but you find them elsewhere.
P:  Yeah, you've got still a great big business in this country.  And one of the things that they 
associate with suburbanization is your plant life, and your troubled lawns, and grasses, and 
flowers and shrubs, and everything else.  So there's an awful lot of interest in that by people 
anyway.  So they're going to do, they're going to be doing, doing something in those things.  So 
why not, why not come up with (--)  But I think that the main thing that I have on that, and 
particularly in the, in one of the ethno-botany, and I don't think maybe this is ethno-botany at all 
the way they're doing it, is the relationship that plant life had played in the various culture 
groups, in this country.  You know, remember, people see a drug store, and they see, they see 
pills in the like.  there was a time we never had those.  And, and about the only thing that 
medicine has done in the say, the modern era, was when they brought knives in and they started 
cutting people up, operations and the like.  A lot of the other things have existed down for years 
and years before it.  The positive things, you know, the things that, the natural things that we use.
There's (--)
M:  The herbal medicine.
P:  Herbal medicine.  Dick Donahue was the Head of the Lowell Plan.  He was on a trip to 
China.  When he came(--)  And he was surprised over there at the role that the herbal part played 
in the medicine of China.  And he came back, and when he came back he spent about two weeks 
in the West Coast.  And he was surprised as the role that the herbal plan, and the leading medical 
schools in California.  So it definitely is a different trend that's coming into this country.  And it's 
coming from the, that's coming from the East.  That part is.  So we are definitely influenced by 
you know, customs and traditions, and practices of those, those particular things.  But I would 
like to say one thing as forcefully as I can.  That, that to go into the part where you're bringing 
her down on a philosophical basis, I would say you're in for a confrontational state.  I would go 
and I could deal with this thing myself entirely from the economic basis.
MA:  Could you tell me how, exactly how having, what I don't have a clear picture of is how the,
how these, is the economic, with the economic advantages are going to be for this.  
P:  Take the economic advantages of it.  If we had say, this laboratory of, we're going to do the 
beautification along the canal banks, and the river banks, anyway.  Let's take that as a giving.  All
right.  There's an awful lot of money invested in that.  All right.  Now what we are, why can't, 
just like the buildings.  You go to Harvard, and you go to Smith College, and you go to Yale, go 
to any of them, the buildings reflect the culture of the people in the history, in the background.  
Why should we have less thinking of the culture of people and the like when we come into a 
city?  So if we're going to plant tree life here, why not respect the composition of our city in 
doing that.  All right, now, so that's one part of it.  Now, when those things are done, we are not 
disassociating ourselves from the people, we're associating with the people.  Now once this is 
done we go to a pharmaceutical company.  We say we have all of these various plant lifes, 
specifically design to reflect various things.  An awful lot of them have some kind of medicinal 
quality according to scholars.  They could tell us what they are.  All right.  If you were going to 
expand your company, here is an urban laboratory with this whole thing set up that we could put 
right in their lap.
MA:  So do you want them to get the chemicals from here, extract them from here, or to do the 
research?
P:  No, say the setting is here.  Otherwise how much would it do for institutional advertising for 
that pharmaceutical company to put their 5%, or whatever they're putting into that institutional 
advertising, to set up their particular building in the, in the city of Lowell.  
MA:  Okay, so the one side of it would be that you could sell this stuff from Lowell.  But that's 
not what you're talking about.  You're really talking about locating here.  
P:  No, what I'm saying is this.  If, if you're going to have, if that department of ethno-botany 
does go into the trees to find out what the medicinal qualities are in there, all of those research 
papers could go into a repository in Lowell, and be made available to that pharmaceutical 
company, or any other that would come here.  In other words, their research and development 
crew could be from all over the United States, because they'd be coming from the University of 
Pennsylvania, the University of South California, all of the other would become, they never 
could afford a research and development group like that.  This is part, just part of the way.  Now 
another thing that was (--)
MA:  Is should be an advantage to Lowell in terms of the taxes and that, you know, that this 
company would bring more money in.
P:  I'm talking about the jobs.  
MA:  The jobs.  Okay.
P:  I'm talking about the jobs.  You know, we have, we have 27% of our kids in the Lowell Public
Schools come from families below the poverty level.  So when you're talking about the economic
development and revitalization of the community, it hasn't come to the average person at all.  
Now if you were seeking out companies that were coming here, not to take advantage of that, but
to take advantage of a good paying industry anyway, you know, and they're coming here, those 
are other jobs for our people here.  Not the mass type of production jobs which we have gotten 
by accident, and no one has made a real point of going out.  In other words, I'm saying that, that 
if you sell, you sell those ingredients.  Like (--)
MA:  This is great.  No, it's really, it's amazing.  
P:  I think I mentioned George Bekrakis before?  
D:  I don't think so.
P:  Well George Bekrakis is the Head of the [unclear] Chemical Company.  It's an international 
chemical company down here on Rte 128.  He sells mostly to foreign countries.  About ten years 
ago, or less, we had a meeting of environmentalist down in the Lowell, the Lawrence Water 
Treatment Plant.  Senator Tsongas rowed down in a canoe, and other politicians rowed down the 
river, and we had the conference down there.  And the thing was on the Merrimack River, and 
how the Merrimack River was coming back.  It's about twenty years ahead of schedule on 
cleaning out the pollution and the re-introduction to salmon and all the other fish in the river.  So 
George, someone asked him, George happened to mention when he was on the panel, he 
mentioned, he said, as a kid I used to swim in the canals, and I used to swim in the river.  And 
some of the people kind of gasped at that.  And George said, oh, you people don't understand the 
water.  He said, I'm the president of a pharmaceutical company.  And he said, let me explain the 
process you go through to purify water for pharmaceuticals.  And he went through the whole 
process of explaining it.  He said, you know, when I finished that final process, he said, I could 
have turned on the Lowell water tap, it was about exactly the same.  
     You know, people were looking at Lowell and the river as a source of pollution.  And here's a 
guy in the business saying that this is about the same type of water the pharmaceutical companies
use.  And they have to go through a great big long process.  I'm saying examine the assets that 
you have and it's relationship to economics, (MA:  but it's interesting because) yeah, and don't go
down the road of saying that these human values have no economic connotations.  Because once 
you talk about human values, people think of cost deficit.  I'm taking human values and talking 
about cost benefit.  
MA:  What really is interesting to me about what you're proposing, is that instead of trying to 
attract companies like Wang, or whatever, that do provide job, that provide jobs, but that offer a 
product that's not connected to this environment, or to this heritage.  You bring in pharmaceutical
companies that have to draw on the past knowledge that went into this environment and then put 
young people, or people getting the jobs in touch with that, and they have to (--)  That's very 
interesting.  
P:  Are you acquainted with Pepperidge Farm Products?
MA:  Oh yes, I'm a big fan of them.  
P:  All right.  When that, we used to have Educator Cracks Companies in Lowell.  And back 
about 1965, 66, 67, in through there, they were in the process of receivership and bankruptcy.  
The one who was holding the paper on it was the Union National Bank.  And the Head of that 
bank was a fellow by the name of Homer Bourgeois.  And I went to Homer Bourgeois and I said,
said look it.  It looks like our Legislation is going to pass on the National Park.  I said, why, why 
don't we take, why don't you take Educator Crack and have them develop ethnic cookies, and 
package them.  And on the package you would have Lowell, and all of that, and have the Park 
and the (--)  He thought it was a good idea.  So, but he came back to me and he said, it's too far 
gone.  There was, it was bankrupt, you know, the company.  (MA:  The Lowell assortment)  But 
Pepperidge Farms did it.  They have the Belgium cracker, they have the Irish cracker, they have 
all of them, they have done (--)  (MA:  The Georgia cracker)  Yeah.  We should, we should go to 
Pepperidge Farm and say, for cripe sake, if you're going to expand, expand in Lowell, because 
that's, that's the theme of our Park.  In other words, I say there's a heck of a lot of economics 
associated with that, with that particular thing.  The Baklava, you know, I, you put some of that 
in a package and it will only way about two ounces, but Pepperidge Farm is doing that.  They 
only put about two ounces of that stuff in there.  But, but we could have, we could have the 
people here working in there, producing their own thing and sending it out.  Think about the 
Southeast Asian population, and who has done anything on any kind of a national level on 
promoting their particular product?  It's a big market, and people are not realizing how big it is.  
MA:  Well you find them, you know, in supermarkets.  You find the sections you know, that cater
to the local populations, but (--)
P:  But see, here's the other thing too.  You go into that thing and you see under Pepperidge Farm
this particular cooking that happens to be Southeast Asian.  I'm apt to buy the thing, see, who is 
of another background entirely.  And I'm getting to like the thing, and I'm telling other people.  
And they'll say, jeese, don't they have some nice stuff?  This is how you do it.  You do it in a 
more (--)
D:  Because it's mediated through the structure that people know, which is Pepperidge Farm.
P:  It's mediated through the structure that they know.  Yes, they're going to go into those stores 
and buy.
MA:  They're not going to buy them in the ethnic department, because that's for ethnics.
P:  Sure.  It's going to be bought into that, into that other thing.  And then so that's the part that 
I'm (--)
D:  Okay.  I just want to clarify one thing.  When you talk about the pharmaceutical companies 
coming in and having their laboratory here, are you talking about them using the gard, the 
gardens which would be developed along the canals, or are you talking about them using the 
plants in the communities?  How would that work out.  
P:  I would say it this way.  One thing I'll say, if we're going to do all of these things anyway, 
we're, we say to them that, that we have all of this various plant life, which is associated with 
medicines anyway, and as your institutional advertising, you say you are the forefront of 
pharmaceutical companies.  
MA:  They could pay local people to produce this stuff.  
P:  They could be given doctoral stipends and everything else for, for the different students from 
all over the world to start doing research on this thing here.  And they could be coming here 
doing the research.  The only thing we say, the products of the research, their papers become part
of our depository here in the city of Lowell.  
D:  Okay.  We're not, this makes, this becomes clearer to me.  When I, when I look at this, you're 
talking about things that we as folklorist have had a great interest in for a long time.  
P:  Yes, you already have the information, but you are thinking of a separate thing. 
D:  And when we, when we look at, when we look at Lowell, you know, we're aware that there is
so much knowledge, so much native knowledge about pharmaceutical plants, just about 
everywhere you go, that you know, I look at Lowell and I think, well now why Lowell?  You 
know, why this place more than any other place.  But do I understand it correctly, when you 
when you use the Pepperidge Farm analogy that, that you're making the argument here that 
Lowell has created a structure, I mean that Lowell itself has become a product that people 
recognize, and that by relating it to Lowell this ideas could be sold from that Lowell has this 
ethnic identity.  
P:  You're doing another thing.  Not only the statement has been made here, in these things here, 
like this Legislation, of the positive role that the various groups have played.  All right.  So this is
the center of that in the United States.  It's the only statement that was made about a group, and 
they happen to be here.  The Park happens, happens to be here.  So when they put out that 
package, they have on that package on the thing, the cultural you know, inter culture Center of 
the United States Park, you know, design to tell, to tell this particular (--)  But also take the new 
group that's here, and we have, they say we have 12,000 Southeast Asians in the city now.  That's
a hell of a market.  How many more in other cities around?  Who was package (--)  They have 
stores, they have to go to these little stores, because none of your big stores are carrying their 
products.  
MA:  Yeah, but you don't want to compete with the (--)
P:  No, I only going to take the cookies.  I want to take, I want to take the part of their culture 
that like, when I, when I had that Belgium cookie that Pepperidge Farm has, that was terrific.  
We go and buy the Belgium, it's Belgium mints.  Well that's a cookie that's been grown, that's 
been grown, they've been used in Belgium for a long time.  Someone just happened to be smart 
enough to package it.  The only progress we ever made in education was made with an individual
teacher that came up with a new approach, was using it successfully for years, no one every 
knew about it.  Someone found out about it.  So one of the book companies come in a found out 
about it, and they packaged it.  And I'm saying the same, the same things could be happening 
here.  
D:  So you're talking about going in, taking a cultural product, and repackaging it in a way that it 
become accessible for a larger audience.
P:  Well that would be one, that would be one thing.  I (--)
M:  And also it provides you know, like it's a home grown economy.  
MA:  Yeah, but it would provide a motive, an incentive for keeping something going.  To keep 
some kind of knowledge going, or something.  
M:  See my, see the dilemma that I see in a lot of this, and what I like you know, sort of Pat's sort
of dynamic version, you know, view of this, is that I, you know, I find like with myself, people in
my generation, you know, who's you know, ancestors are French Canadian, by the time you get 
to my level, there's a real washed out sense of identity and expression.  And what is it that can 
either re-instill or cultivate, you know, an appreciation and an understanding of you know, where 
I come from.  Of what I am.  You know, and that's what I keep looking for, you know, in terms of
this park.  Not that I just want my grandfather's photograph in a museum.  I want to know how 
(--) 
P:  It's not a thing of the past, it's a thing of the future we're talking about.  
M:  Right.  Yeah.  I mean I want to know how the fact that my grandfather had a, you know, a 
French Canadian meat market in Little Canada is going to have some importance, or connection 
to the life of you know, my brothers kids who are going to grow up in the city, you know.  
P:  Just to give you another just of the economics of it.  Part of this process, and your definition 
of culture is one that in fact, we worked a long time on a definition, and we were talking about 
culture.  And we had met with the Quebec government.  And they have a Minister in Quebec 
titled The Minister of Cultural and Economic Affairs.  Now that's one, cultural and economics, 
it's bound together.  We had a terrific reproductive experience.  We were talking about 
interchange of all kinds of cultural economic activities.  Some of our people going up there, their
people coming down here, and the things that we could be doing, and the things that we could be
sharing.  And so I, I was a little bit hesitant at first talking to them because we sold the things so 
quickly too them.  They agreed with the thing so quickly.  So I said, either they're very very 
smart, or they're very shallow.  And so about a month later I get a thing through the mail, and it's 
the white paper of the Quebec Government on what their definition of culture was.  Exactly the 
same as ours, and it was the harmonization between human and economic factors.  And that's, 
that's what their definition was.  In other words, when people are dealing with communities, 
where culture is that harmonization, and the way the people adjust, when they're dealing with 
Folklife they're disassociating at the thing which is the determinant.  (MA:  Umhm)  And that's 
why I say they're making, they're making the big mistake.  They should go back and take the two
things.  I'm saying that if we go and take culture now, and (--)
