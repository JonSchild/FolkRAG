By PETER K . 
MCCAREW. 
I'M the happiest man in the world to-day, 
An' the devil a

care, 
What envious people may think or say, 
For wid all sorts of humor Ill bear, 
For you know, don't you all ? 
Me name's Paddy McKee, 
And another's girl name is Kate. 
Now me name is ail me own, 
But before I'm done, 
I'll make it hers too, from consate. 
Cnonus. 
Oh, then come to ne shindig, along wid your girls, 
An' dance to the bould rocky roads, 
Bring your swallows and kids, 
And their chig,nons and curls, 
Ye devils of fun we'll have—loads. 
I've been to the Priest's to settle the bans, 
Jut for fear there would be a 
mistake. 
Says lie: " Thin me boy, yerselves are the wanE 
That a 
tearin' foine couple will make, 
An' me blessin I 
give, 
That it's long my

01 young Mac's may there be galore, 
With praties and tay

For them all the day; 
And houses and lots to the fore.` 
Oh then come, 
It's I'll have the mother in-law so fine, 
To make regulations and laws. 
Poor woman, I'm sorry she's deaf and bilnd, 
And her tongue don't sit right in her jaws. 
So betwixt Kate and I 
We'll be all in her eye. 
And when children will come, never fear, 
Won't she be the nurse, 
Thin she might be off worse, 
For the squalls will be all in her ear. 
Oh then come, &e. 
Thin if you all wish me lashions of joy, 
Wid me mother-in-law and me wife, 
You've the hand an' the heart of an Irish boy, 
In all of your struggles through 
May you all soon be spliced, 
As soon as you like, once't or twicet, 
So long as you're happy as me. 
An' ye may all depend 
At the troubles I'll tend, 
As sure as rm Paddy McKee.

TOM AND JERRY, THE TWINS. 
As sung by M ORTON 4.4; Iluarms. 
Oil, here we are a 
couple of gay colored darks, 
And were out on a 
bit of a 
spree; 
We ain't very parcicular about the style of our rig, 
As you can undoubtedly see. 
So girls, open your eyes, and go in for a 
prize, 
Now here's a 
chance, see who wins, 
For such gay darks you never can find, 
As gay Tom and Jerry, the twins. 
CEtORMi. 
For so gayly we feel, [ SYmr.] 
From our head to our heel, 
Such gay colored darks you never can find, 
As gay Tom and Jerry, the twins. 
'Way in our Southern home we'd oft' in trouble be, 
They could'ut tell him from me; 
We're both very sharp and we're out for a 
lark, • 
And we're gwine to join the jubilee. 
So look at our feet, don't you think them a 
treat, 
They are matched together like pins; 
We are handsome and gay, so the people all say, 
We are gay Tom and Jerry the twins. 
For so gayly, tlis.

SONG AND DANCE. 
OH, ain't it nice on Wednesday eve, 
The time when lovers meet, 
To have your girl lean on 3 
our arm, 
Oh, my! ain't it a 
treat. 
Just once a 
week a 
call I 
make, 
To see my little one, 
She's just as sweet to me as cake 
Or a 
dainty sugar plum. 
Ctioncs. 
I 
am keeping steady, steady company, 
Where there is lots of fun, yes, lots of fun for me, 
I 
visit Jane on Wednesday eve, 
Just when the clock strikes nine, 
Now really, folks, I 
do believe 
'Some day she 
ill be mine. 
Iler folks have no objection 
To my calling at the Louse, 
For I'm high in their affections, 
Just as innocent as a 
mouse. 
Jane blushes, too, all over her face, 
When I 
kiss her at the door, 
in a'l her blush and Emile I 
trace, 
A. lingering wish for more. 
I 
am keeping, etc. 
Now, young men, all just bear in mind, 
Some charmer you must get; 
Some nice young damsel you must find, 
That you can call your pet. 
And call on her just once a 
week, 
You can do it if you try, 
With kisses one and other greet, 
The same as Jane, and I.

JOLLY CROSS-TOWN NIGS. 
Written by JAMES JOHNSON. 
WE 
just arrived from across the town, 
And we are Laing mighty good, 
You see we're none of those common nigs, 
That hoists coal and shovels wood. 
But we are two of the jolliest coves, 
When dressed up in these rigs, 
We are known both far and near, 
As the jolly cross-town nigs. 
Cnonrs. 
t3o good evening all and how do you do, (Svmr.) 
Let the baud play whilst we hoist up our shoe, (Sx3rP). 
We throw our feet all out of shape, 
Mind, what we say is true; 
For you can all see at a 
glance 
We're so easy in our great big shoe. 
You have heard of dancing, dandy Ike, 
And pretty young Alabama Joe, 
Why they are so jealous of us 
That they hardly know what to do. 
But as for them, why, we don't care 
A bale of buttons or a 
box of figs; 
They have big feet and can't complete, 
With the jolly Cross-Town figs. 
So good- evening, etc. 
Now I 
guess we have said enough, 
About this handsome, stylish pair, 
But while we're singing here to you, 
They will wonder where we are, 
We've got an invitation to a 
ball, 
So we will change our tip, 
There will be none there so nobby, 
As the jolly Cross-Town Nigs. 
So good-evening, etc. •'

WOULD I 
WERE A 
FISH. 
014, would I 
were a 
fish, how happy I 
would be, 
If I 
could live upon the land as well as in the sea; 
In a 
bird cage I'd be useful 
As a 
preacher in the church, 
And when the birds would light on me, 
Why, then I'd be a 
perch. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, would I 
were a 
a 
fish, how happy I 
would be, 
If I 
could live upon the land as well as on the sea. 
Now if I 
was a 
fish, I'd like to be a 
trout, 
Swimming in the river and poking out my snout, 
Ana when you'd a 
fishing go 
You'd all get full of beer, 
I 
wouldn't bite at your old hooks, 
But slide off on my ear. 
Oh would, dee. 
III only was a 
fish I'd like to be a 
whale, 
So then I 
would be useful, from head down to my tail, 
And if some honest man, 
Who had to work and toil, 
Would bore a 
hole right in my back, 
Why, there he would strike oil. 
Oh would, Sm. 
Oh, if I 
was a 
fish, wouldn't that be sweet ? 
Made into a 
bouquet and thrown at some lady's feet. 
And when she'd pick me up, 
If so inclined she felt, 
She'd put me to her little nose, 
Why, theu I'd be a 
smelt. 
Oh would, Ac.

PANNIE POWERS. 
W ritten by .
EDDIE Fox, for GEORGE POWERS. 
SONG AND DANCE. 
I 
HAVE sung about the yaller gal, 
And she's lovely as a 
rose, 
But now I'll sing a 
strain of one, 
Indeed, you can't suppose. 
Her form is like Adonis fair. 
And her cheeks blush like the flowers, 
But the only girl that holds my heart 
Is little Fannie Powers. 
CHORUS. 
It was early in the Fall I 
met her at a 
ball, 
And she wore a 
wreath of coral flowers, 
As by her side I 
sat my heart went pit-a-pat, 
As I 
gazed on my little Fannie Powers. 
I 
asked her then to dance with me, 
If she felt so inclined, 
She gave a 
smile and a 
look 
And answered, I 
don't mind, 
We danced the polka o'er and o'er, 
And passed the merry hours, 
I 
found that night my heart had flown, 
To little Fannie Powers. 
It was early, Ix. 
I 
could not work, I 
could not sleep, 
For my heart was full of strife, 
I 
went to her and asked her plain, 
To become my darling wife. 
She hung her head and blushed so deep, 
And her answer—you may guess, 
She gave a 
sigh, and then a 
look, 
And faintly answered yes. 
It was early, ttc

MY LOVE TO THE WAR HAS GONE, 
As sung by Miss AN NIE ADAXs. 
I'M broken hearted quite. 
For me there's no delight; 
Oh, dear, oh dear, what shall I 
do. 
My love to the war has gone, 
And left me here forlorn, 
Oh, dear, oh, dear, my hopes are few. 
I 
wish there was no fighting, 
I 
wish there was no war ; 
If I 
the Goddess were of love, 
I'd rule it over Mar ; 
Or if our kings and rulers, 
They must bark and bite, 
Let those who make the quarrel take 
Upon themselves to fight. 
I 
shed tears fast as rain, 
And when I 
sleep would fain, 
My screams in dreams alarm the neighborhood. 
For I 
fancy I 
can see. 
Ify love so dear to me; 
Oh, Fred, there dead on the cold, cold ground. 
I

I 
cannot sleep at night, 
And I've lost my appetite,

LITTLE sweetheart, come and kiss me, 
Just once more before I 
go; 
Tell me, truly, will you miss me, 
As I 
wander to and fro ? 
Let me feel the tender pressing 
Of your ruby lips to mine, 
With your dimpled hands compressing, 
And your snowy arms entwine. 
CITOR175. 
Ah! little sweetheart, come and kiss me, 
Come and whisper soft and low, 
That your heart will sadly miss me, 
As I 
wander to and fro. 
Little sweetheart, come and kiss me, 
We may never meet again, 
We may never roam together, 
Down the dear old shady lane. 
Future years may bring us sorrow. 
That our hearts but 1.ttle know, 
Still of care we should not borrow, 
Come and kiss me ere I 
go.

But she's gone and left me all alone, 
And broken my poor heart.

Hard to change my mind. 
She's broken the heart of many another nig, 
And she's almost broken mine.

And if she don't marry me

WATER NYMPEr, 
BENEATH an elm beside the spring 
I 
sat just as the moon came o'er the hill 
And heard a 
voice in sweetness sing; 
Now methinks I 
hear it still, 
Angelic WJS the measure, 
It told of love and pleasure. 
Oh, would she were my treasure, 
And I 
her chosen der, 
To sit beside the cooling spring, 
Or dnnce upon the meadows, velvet green, 
And fT1 myse.f a 
woodland king, 
With a 
fairy little queen. 
Once more I 
went at set of sun, 
To hear that voice and calch the loving strain 
And ere the cuckoo had begun 
His sweet song it came again 
From out the limpid water, 
The Gods had surely brought her; 
More fair than mortals daughter 
Was she who drew me there, 
To sit beside the cooling spring, 
Or dance unon the meadows velvet green, 
And feel myself a 
woodland king 
With a 
fairy little queen. 
My heart was filled with perfect bliss 
When to me spoke that little water sprite, 
And her wish was only this: 
That I'd come there every night. 
Now every night I 
meet her, 
Her voice is something sweeter, 
With smile and kiss I 
greet her 
Beneath that Elm's co )1 
shade, 
To sit beside that cooling spring, 
Or dance upon the me idows velvet green, 
And feel myself a 
woodland King, 
With a 
fairy little Queen.

And told his story without scope, 
She at him flew and ran him through

DELEITANTY. 
AS I 
strolled out one evening, 
When the silver moon was shining, 
And 
little stars were twinkling, 
Alt in the month of June, 
I 
cnanced to meet a 
beauty, 
So syIph-like, neat and pretty, 
With pouting lips like ruby— 
Beach blossoms in full bloom, 
And as she came up nearer, 
Her sweet race full in view, 
My heart spake like a 
whisper, 
Fair maiden I 
love you, 
CHORUS. 
Oh? yes, yes, yes, she's all the world to me, 
No, no, no, there's none so fair as she, 
Her bright blue eyes betwiching, 
had pierced me thro' and tiro', 
My heart still breathes a 
whisper, 
Fair maiden I 
love you. 
Tho' strange it may be seeming, 
Her face is ever beaming, 
A 
starlight . n 
my dreaming, 
A 
daisy dipped In dew, 
Ah! could my arms perlieu her, 
I 
like a 
dove would coo her, 
And wed as well as woo her, 
This maiden fair and true; 
And all the world might envy, 
And wish me ill to do, 
But I 
would still be happy, 
Fair maiden, but with you. 
! 
yes, yes, yes - cfz,c, 
Ah here I 
have a 
letter, 
What could please me better, 
Now, who can be the writer, 
That hand I 
never knew, 
It says, dear friend, excuse me, 
If as a 
friend I 
choose thee. 
To meet me, don't refuse me, 
This course I 
must pursue; 
can no longer tarry, 
Since first my eyes met you, 
Now, if you wish to marry, 
You'll find me good and true.

As sung by W ALTERS & M ORTON% 
WHILE walking down the street one day, 
All in the wind and rain, 
I 
saw a

So listen, now, what I 
tc11 to you is true, 
She'd a

She's an India rubber yaller 
And wears a 
gingham gown—her maiden name is Lit, 
She threw both feet clean out of sight, 
Well, you know how it is. 
I 
ofrored her my untharel, 
She thanked me with a 
smile, 
I 
asked how far from there she lived, 
She said ' twas just a 
mile. 
I 
told her I 
would call on her, 
S:-.0 said. oh, not for Liz. 
illy father he would angry be, 
Well, you know how it is. 
That night she ran away with me, 
To the minister's we went; 
He asked me what we wanted, 
And if on marriage we were bent. 
Ile asked me for the license, then, 
I 
turned around to Liz, 
She smilingly replied to him 
Well, you know how it is,

THE TWINS. 
Sung by Miss JENNIE ENGL. 
IN form and features, face and limb 
I 
grew so like my brother, 
That folks got taking me for him, 
And each for one another; 
It puzzled all our kith and kin 
Anil reached a 
frightful pitch, 
For one of us was born a 
twin, 
But not a 
soul knew which. 
One day, to make the matter worse, 
Before our names were fixed, 
As we were being washed by nurse 
We got completely mixed; 
And so you se by fate's decree, 
Or rather nurse's whim, 
My brother John got christened me 
And I 
got chriz',ened 
Tins fata2 likehoss even dogged 
My footsteps when at 
And I 
was always being Bogged, 
For John turned out a 
fool! 
I 
put this question fruitlessly, 
To every one I 
knew, 
What would you do if you were me 
To prove that you were you. 
This sad resemblance turned the tide 
Of my domestic life, 
And somehow my intended bride 
Became my brother's wife; 
In fact. year after year this same 
Absurd mistake wen' on, 
And when I 
died. the neighbors came 
And buried—brother John. 
Sung by ITALTEns ,

going to tell you of my girl, 
Oh, Verbena ! 
She'd eyes like diamonds, teeth like pearls, 
And the honey from her lips 
Like the dew- drop gently falls, 
I 
intend to claim her some day. 
Ad 
then I'll happy be, and then I'll happy oe, 
We met at the gay mabelle, 
And we danced so merrily. 
CHORUS. 
Oh little Verbena, my Verbena. 
The lrst day that we met, 
fell in love with you at sight, 
The time Ill never . orget. 
I 
ye you now, and always shall, 
is lonp as ever J. can; 
Don:t leave me now, Y .
erbena twat; 
For that awful circus man. 
My love to her I'll ever sing, 
Oh, Verbena 
Fve purchased her cl wedding ring, 
A 
bran new parasol 
And a 
set of auburn curls, 
And now I'm sure she'll have me. 
And never more will look 
At the chaps with spangled trunks, 
Who turn flip-flaps, giant swings, 
And jump through paper hoops. 
Oh little Verbena, Zta) 
Them circus chaps are awful 'cute, 
Oh, Verbena! 
And tell things that they hadn't ought, 
And look so awful nobby 
As they ride around the ring. 
But don't believe what they say, , 
For you are the world to me, 
That's what I 
think of thee, 
And next Sunday we'll get married,, 
And then we'll happy be. 
CHORUS. 
Little Verbena, my Verbena!' 
Then you'll be my bride; 
I'll work and toil, attend to you,, 
And be ever by your side. 
No circus chap or tumbler bold, 
Can e'er you from me take, 
For if they try I'm very sure 
They'll make a 
grand mistake. 
I'M deep in love with a 
pretty little blonde, 
I 
met one afternoon, 
I 
watched her smile and caught her eye, 
My heart was gone quite soon; 
I 
then essayed to speak to her, 
And thus she answered me: 
Oh is it not a 
pleasant time 
At a 
Saturday matinee. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, yes, Pm caught in cupid's snare. 
I 
am to you, I 
do declare, 
For she is gay and pretty, too, 
As one would wish to see, 
Is this pretty little blonde I 
met just so, 
At a 
Saturday matinee. 
I 
walked with her and saw her home, 
And pressed her hand, oh, my! 
And promised that I'd call again, 
Before a 
week passed by. 
'Twas Thursday night that I 
did go 
To meet this charming blonde, 
I 
then declared to love her troo 
And ever to be fond. 
Oh yes, tte. 
Again I 
went dressea in my best 
This charming blonde to see, 
I 
popped the question boldly out, 
At a 
Saturday matinee. 
She answered yes, but then he sure, 
And you must promise me, 
To take me when I 
wan't to go 
To a 
Saturday Matinee. 
Oh yes, Sze..

OH! Mollie, darling, the anchor is weighed 
The ship is now ready to sail o'er the sea, 
Each moment is precious, and time will not wait,

You're going far away from kindred and friends, 
Off to the land that is far o'er the foam, 
We've no one but you to gladden our hearts— 
Don't leave us, Mollie, sweet light of our home. 
CHORUS. 
Don't cross the sea, Mollie, and leave us alone, 
For dreary our beautiful home then will be.

Oh! Mollie, my darling, your father is ill, 
But still he has come down to see you depart. 
He stands by your side in our sorrow and pain, 
And tears tell the anguish that lies in his heart, 
Oh ! come to my arms, let Inc fold you again, 
Close to the heart that is throbbing for thee, 
Remember the days when I 
sang you to sleep, 
Don't leave us, Mollie, to cross the blue sea. 
Don't cross the sea, Mollie, &c. 
Oh I 
Mollie, my darling, say what will you do, 
Alone in a 
land where but strangers abide, 
No kind words you'll hear of advice, Mollie dear, 
But ah ! many evils will lurk at your side; 
Let me kiss you, perhaps for the last time on earth, 
For we are old, and our days aro but few, 
There's tears in your eyes, I

you'll not go— 
Heav'n pour sweet blessings, dear Mollie, on you.

gal with all my might, 
Her name it is Afalinda White, 
I 
feel so very good to-night, 
I 
could throw myself clean out of sight. 
WHEN I 
landed at Swate Castle, Garden, 
I'd just came from the say. 
In my pockets I 
had not a 
farthing, 
As I 
stepped out up the Broadway; 
I 
walked up to a 
lamp-lighter, 
The mystery for to unravel, 
His hair was cut short like a 
flAter, 
So I 
shouldered my bundle and traveled 
Cnonts. 
Hurrah for the Stars and the Stripes, 
And the land where we never see fogs, 
If I 
hadn't come here by the pipes, 
I'd been digging up turf in the bogs. 
Shure the rola( it was dirty and sloppy, 
Until I 
came to a 
street called Wall, 
A 
blackguard shouted, there goes a 
Croppy, 
Whin I 
him to the big City Hall, 
I 
axed a 
Dutch barber the way; 
lie answered me dunder and blitzen, 
And a 
big old fat Yankee steppod out, 
And made me an American citizen, 
hurrah for the Stars, &c. 
The first time I 
wint out to Chicago, 
The weather it was very warm. 
The Commissioners axed me if I'd go 
And settle upon a 
nice farm. 
No, says I, 
go back to New York, 
Where the Politicks they are so pretty, 
Live your Dutchmen stop here and work, 
But be jabers I'll stick to the city. 
Hurrah for the Stars, &c. 
Bad luck to that villain from Sligo, 
Shure he tould me his name it was Hubbs, 
He sould me a 
card for Chicago, 
Be my soul 'was an ould Jack of Clubs, 
But I 
musn't indulge in reflections, 
What I've said isn't worthy of note, 
I'll be running for Sheriff next election, 
So step up me brave boys and vote.

And wilted like a

And married been beneath the mould, 
Though artfully I 
have been sold, 
He spurned me all for love and gold; 
But when my ghost he does behold, 
If ghosts can talk, he won't I 
scold, 
And her bed-post fast I'll hold, 
And cry your small game out, I'm told 
With fright he'll ugly turn and old, 
Then in a 
moment grow gray poll'd, 
And when out of bed he's rolled, 
He will in a 
moment turn quite cold, 
Then him in my arms I 
will enfold, 
And bear him away, where— 
Little Jack Horner sat in the corner, 
Eating his piece of Christmas pie, 
He put in his thumb, 
And pulled out a 
plum, 
And said— 
High diddle diddle, 
The cat in the fiddle, 
The cow jumps over the moon, 
The little dog laughed to see the sight, 
.o 
I 
hope I've pleased you all to-night.

TWO GREENHORNS. 
Written and Sung by TELE FIELDINGS 
WE'RE what yees call green horns. 
We're only just landed 
From the City of Dublin, 
Afar over the sea; 
Though to be called green, 
We will not stand it, 
Tho' foolish we look 
We know all your way. 
CHORUS, 
Tho' our native land ' Us green, 
Oh, that's no reason why, 
That we should be called the same, 
Remember that, me boys. 
'Twas not want nor starvation 
That brought us amongst you, 
As from our appearances 
That you can see, 
For at home we had plenty, 
'Tis the truth that I 
tells yees, 
But we longed for to see, 
This land of the free. 
Tho' our native, &e..

Written by jOIIN FIELDING% 
ARRAH, why do yees look at us so, 
I 
s'pose it's because we look green, 
We have but just landed you know, 
So yees ought not to trate us so mane, 
We left ould Ireland last month, 
On the steamer the City of Cork, 
And we came here all in a 
jump, 
To see the United States of New York. 
CIIORt7e. 
Just from Ireland, 
Just from Ireland, 
Yes we are, yes we are, 
We landed here an hour or two ago,

The day we celebrate, 
In honor of St. Patrick, 
Old Ireland's patron saint. 
CHORUS. 
On St. Patrick's Day, 
We'll march so gay, 
Up the Bowery and down Broadway, 
If we don't have fun, 
The devil's to pay 
On the Seventeenth of March. 
This is the hat I'll wear, 
And 
put on my false hair, 
And as we march together, 
The people they will say, 
There goes an Irish couple, 
That keep St. Patrick's day. 
On St. Patrick's Day, &c. 
CACKLE, CACKLE, CACKLE! 
MY name is Peter Simple, and I 
give you all 'a warning, 
That I'm an early riser, for I 
wake when day is dawning; 
At four o'clock I 
leave my bed in dreadful agitation, 
Awakened very ear:y by this farm-yard conversation. 
Cnoucs. 
Oh! cackle, cackle, cackle, cackle, 
At morning's early dawning, 
Cock-a-doodle-doo my friends, gives us all a 
warning, 
Fresh new laid eggs for breakfast ev'ry morning., 
Chuck, chuck, chuck, chuck, chuck, chuck! cock-a-doodle-doo 
Bright Chanticleer proclaims the morn, no doubt that's ver3 
right, 
I 
wish'd he not proclaim the hour so near the dead of night, 
lie is the best alarum, he ensures a 
fellow's waking, 
I 
wish he'd not begin before the early morn is breaking. 
Oh! cackle, 3.:c, 
I 
go to bed at tea time, glad to rest my weary legs, 
And my revenge upon the fowls, is eating up their eggs, 
I 
have perchance a 
pleasant l:Fe:1111 of fairies wittit number, 
All singing sweetly to me, when I'm waken'd from my slumber. 
! 
cackle, & c. 
I 
wish they'd let me lie a 
bed, but then you see they won't, 
Oh! cruel cock-a-do:I.:le-do°, please cock-a-doodle-don7! 
I've not a 
doubt my feather'd friends, that good are your inten-
tions, 
I 
wish tho' you'd go somewhere else to hold your " Hen con. 
ventious." 
FASCINATING GLANCES. 
ONE eve I 
took a 
stroll, 
And a 
sly meeting stole 
With my sweetheart in the garden, 
I 
snatched a 
kiss so sweet, 
When there we first did meet, 
And quickly asked her pardon. 
Then she pouted, and said I 
was naughty, 
This pretty, little belle. (SYm.) 
She stamped her little foot 
And looked so haughty, 
I 
promised not to tell. (Svm.) 
CHORUS. 
She had golden hair and rosy cheeks 
Eyes like cupid's lances, 
She won my heart that very night, 
With her fascinating glances 
It cannot be denied, 
We sat side by side, 
Talking sweet things in the bower, 
When I 
my love did tell, 
She on my bosom fell, 
And I 
kissed her for an hour. 
54 
Then she pouted, and said I 
was naughty, 
.This pretty little belle. (Srm.) 
She stamped her little foot 
And looked so haughty, 
I 
promised not to tell. ( Sym.) 
She had golden hair, .ke. 
I 
said sweet Anna Bell, 
You know I 
love you well, 
And I 
ne'er will cause you sorrow, 
I 
will happy be, 
If you'll but agree 
To marry me on the morrow. 
Then she pouted, and said I 
was naughty, 
This pretty little belle. ( Sym.) 
She stamped her little foot 
4.nd looked so haughty. 
I 
promised not to tell. ( Sym.) 
She had golden hair, Sm.

PLAYING HOOKEY. 
Original with SHERMAN & M ACK. 
WE'RE as happy, just as happy as can be, 
Were full of fun, my little Sue and me, 
We ran away from school to-day, 
And oh, we had such fun; 
Playing hookey from the school, 
I 
know is against the rule, 
But we don't care, when we got there, 
The school it was begun. 
I 
don't care, I 
don't care, 
Do you my little Sue, 
You know I 
don't, you kncw S 
dohl, 
I'm happy when with you. 
(Repeat.) 
First we went and got some cherries in the) 13-ood, 
And I'll bet you they tasted good, 
And then we went down to the pond, 
And with the ducks did play; 
Then Jimmy climbed an apple tree, 
And threw all the cherries down to me, 
But a 
great big dog he chased us, 
Oh, didn't he frighten me. 
I 
don't care, Sse. 
My 
lover he's going to sea, Oh ! Nicodemus, 
lie's ping away and leaving me, 
To watch the little fishes, swimming in the sea 
But he'll soon wiih for home, and to be back with me, 
The ship will heave to, Nicodemus! 
And so wretched yon will be, ,;o 
wretched you will be. 
CHOEU8. 
(Spoken.) So she said— 
Oh, Nicodemus ! Nicodeams! 
don't you go away? 
I've loved you N1COCIOM7li and I've hived you many a 
day, 
I've loved you in your plain attire, your lovely fustian coat, 
Don,t leave me Nicodemus, for that boiler-bursting boat. 
(SPosEN.) And again she began to sing--
Salt water, you know, is very wet, Oh, Nicodemus I 
You know you are my only pet, 
And your absence will cause me to fume and fret ; 
They will feed you on salt junk and nasty soft boiled peas, 
Think of this well : Ni2oderaus ! 
Ere you cross those watery seas, those windy watery seas; 
So she said, Lt, c. 
And she also said— 
Of pumpkins boiled you'll g t 
no more, Oh, Nicodemus I 
Convince yourself of this before, 
You can't run away therc's no back door: 
Reef the anchor, Nicodemus, he Cartain la3 will say, 
You'll have to hold on by your eyebrows, 
Or you'll be blown away, straight down to Botany Bay; 
So she said, 8-4. 
This is what !le said— 
It's no ire you talkibc, to me, waid Nicodenats ! 
7e'or I 
intend agoing oi lc sea, 
Out to China for Souchor:f., and Lingo Tea, 
That's a 
profitable cargo, in fact you can't get a 
better, 
Direct from Hong Kong, Australia, 
When you send to me a 
letter, you send to Int, a 
letter. 
And she began again yelping, 
Oh. Nicodemus, eke.

BEAUTIFUL LOVE. 
As sung by Gnonon lTAr.m , 
the English comique. 
LOYV, love, Oh, what is love? 
love. ' tis that makes man feel 
sc peculiar; 
Oh, love, who does not love a 
Maud, a 
Matilda, a 
Jane or a 
Julia ? 
Love it is, and love alone, that makes the world go round and 
round, 
Love is certain to be known, where a 
woman's to be found. 
When ooe has the first attack it's like raspberry jam, running 
down ons back. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, love, beautiful /ove, 1‘..ve it is that makes a 
man feel so pe 
culiar. 
Oh, love, beautiful love, a man's but a 
loot when he falls in 
love. 
Oh love, when you're in love, to presents to parties hndIpic-
nics you treat her, 
Oh love, just squeeze her glove, and you feel just as tho' you'd 
like to eat her ; 
But the best of loves must part—then an end comes to your 
bliss, 
You press the dear. one to your heart and take from her the 
parting kiss, 
You bid her good-byt. 1t the door with another sly kiss and two 
or three more. 
Oh, love, S:c. 
59 
Oh love, when you're in love every half hour you'd go to court 
her. 
But Oh, love, if she won't love, you talk about drowning your-
self in cold water; 
If it's all right she'll giggle and say please ask father if I 
may, 
Then you feel so jolly and gay, and tease her till she names t;I , 
day, 
You'll serenade her when she's abed and her dad drops flow 
pots on 
on your head. 
Oh love, Sze. 
Oh love, when you've your love out, all the money you have 
you must ladle, 
Servants, dresses, parties, and balls, perhaps each year a 
cherub 
to lay in the cradle. 
When the honeymoon is past then your eyes are not so blind, 
Your dream was far too good to last and your face grows long 
to find, 
Your looked for happiness begins with a mother-in-law and 
beatiful twins. 
Oh love, &-. e. 
THERE is a 
charm I 
can't explain 
About a 
girl I've seen; 
My heart beats fast when she goes past, 
In a 
dark dress trimmed in green; 
Itei• eyes are bright as evening stars, 
So lovio,2: ail(: so shy; 
And the folks all stop and look around, 
Whenever she goes by. 
Cuortes. 
And I 
feel just as happy as a 
big sunflower, 
That nods and bends hi the breezes, 
And my heart is as ligla as the wind that biow, 
The leav2s from off the trees—zees. 
As days past on, and we became 
Like friends of olden times, 
I 
thought the question I 
would pop, 
And as 
her to be ; nine; 
But the illISWer I 
received next day— 
Mow could she treat me so ! 
Instead of being mine for life, 
She simply answered, no. 
And I 
feel just as happy, &c. 
I 
went next day, dressed in m,y best, 
This young girl for to see; 
To ask her if she would explain 
Why she bad shaken me; 
She said she really felt quite sad, 
rt2 ,-) 
cause me such distress, 
And when I 
said, 
Wont you be mine?" 
Or course she answered " yes." 
And I 
feel just as happy, &e. 
Ts, those who have never perused the sad story of CHABL0172 
TIE:4PM; joyed with her in her early pleasures, sympathised and 
wept with her in her sorrows, a../(1 glowed with indignation at the 
wrongs which the suffered from base, calculating villains, an oppor-
tunity is afforded of reading one of the most absorbing works ever 
written, proving " truth stranger than fiction." 
The poet's lines are but a 
just description of the unfortunate 
Charlotte Temple: 
Her form was feu/fleas, and her mind, 
Untainted yet by art, 
Was noble, just, humane and kind, 
And virtue warmed her heart. 
But, eh I 
the cruel spoiler came—" 
This book, in the language of Mrs. Rowson, " affords a 
striking 
,x.ample that vies, however prosperous in the beginning, in the 
ød Imuls only to misery and sne.
