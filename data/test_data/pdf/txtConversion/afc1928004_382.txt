A LEAN BANANA. 
Written by SAM DEVERE, and sung with great success, at the 
Olympic Theatre, N. Y.

Air.—" Eileen Alanna." 
A lean banana, decayed to the core; 
Ever since I 
slipped on thy peel I 
feel so sore; 
On my back I 
linger'd just where I 
fell, 
The sweet words I 
uttered would not do to tell. 
If I 
could have caught that dirty-looking gawk 
Who threw that banana peel on the walk; 
It made me see stars that I 
never saw before— 
A 
lean Banana from some foreign shore. 
CHORus. 
Lightly I 
tread on the sidewalk ever since, 
A 
lean banana, I've heard of you before, 
I 
slipped on thee:once, I'll be cautious evermore; 
A lean banana, I 
love thee no more. 
A 
lean banana, you've caused many a 
sore; 
I 
slipped on thy peel and it turned me o'er and o'er: 
Young girls have blushed, too, when thrown off their pegs, 
Slipping on a 
banana and showing their legs. 
Many are the pedestrians you've caused to fall— 
Great, big and little, lean, lank and tall; 
The seats of fat men's pants you've busted and you've tore--
A 
lean banana from some Dutch grocery store. 
Lightly I 
tread on the sidewalk ever since, 
A 
lean banana, I've heard of you before, 
I 
slipped on thee once, I'll be cautious evermore, 
A 
lean banana, from FOnle Du' eh c•.rocery store,

Price 40 cents. 
Let the past be all forgotten— 
Why that look of weary pain? 
Tell me that you love me fondly, 
Take me to your heart again. 
Bid my days flow on so gently, 
Calmly as the Summer Sea; 
Whisper truly, dearest, sweetest, 
Have I 
not been kind to thee? 
CHORUS. 
Stay the teardrop falling fast, 
Darksome days will never last: 
Darling, whisper sweet to me, 
Have I 
not been kind to thee? 
Lovely roses soon will blossom, 
Tho' the leaves are falling round; 
What if days of sorrow greet us, 
Sunny hours will soon be found. 
Can we e'er forget the gladness 
That has bloom'd for you and me? 
Chide me not, but whisper .sweetly— 
Have I 
not been kind to thee? 
Stay the teardrop, etc. 
Drive away that look of sorrrow, 
Ev'ry fault of mine forgive; 
Let our past be all forgotten, 
Only for your sake I 
live! 
Smile your olden smile then, dearest, 
In those eyes my Heav'n I 
see; 
Doubt no more my heart's affection, 
Have I 
not been kind to thee? 
Stay the teardrop, etc,

I 
Never Was so Happy in My Life. 
NEW SONG AND DANCE. 
Sung by T. M. II ENGLER. 
I 
never was so happy in my life! 
I'm here to tell to you 
How I 
fell in love, one night last week, 
With a 
charming girl in blue. 
'Twits at a 
masquerade 
Where mirth and joy did reign. 
„My love was there as a 
Gipsey Queen, 
While I 
was King of Spain. 
You ought to see her dancing, ( symph.) 
Her pretty little dark eyes glancing 
So lovingly on 
Music by GIBSON. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, she filled my heart with sunshine, 
That rippled thro' hair, 
I'll never find, in all this world, 
Another girl so fair. 
Oh, my heart went pit-a-pat, 
When first I 
led her to to the dance, 
Her little hand was held in mine ; 
How could I 
lose the chance 
To ask if I 
might see her home, 
When e'er she choose to go. 
I 
really thought that I 
would die 
If she should answer no; 
But then she looked so smiling, 
Her pretty little ways beguiling, 
As she said, yes, to me. 
Oh, she filled my heart, & e. 
The stars were shining brightly in the sky, 
As I 
walked by her side ; 
I 
whispered all my love—plead 
That she would be my bride ; 
Of course, 1 
hate to tell you, here, 
The answer she gave me; 
But if you'll all be pleased to call, 
We'll have --ort stay to tea. 
Oh, she filled my hear!, ttc.

I'LL TAKE A 
DAY OFF ; AND FIND OUT. 
Written by HARRY BENNETT for SAM DEVERE. 
I'm going to sing of an odd little phrase, 
Of which you have heard. I've no doubt : 
Ask your friends any question, their answer will be 
"I'll take a 
day off and find out." 
You'll hear this expression each day in the week. 
In the town, If you're roaming about, 
And every one's gone on this quaint little speech— 
" 
I'll take a 
day off and tind out." 
CHORUS. 
There's many flash sayings in use now- a- days, 
You'll hear them while strolling about : 
But the strangest of all things I've heard is just this— 
•• I'll take a 
day off and find out. -
A man falls in love with a 
pretty young girl: 
And is anxious to make her his bride; 
His money he spends taking her out at night. 
Or out on the road for a 
ride. 
He's " giving her taffy," the young men all say, 
His wardrobe is all " up the spout;'• 
When he asks her to marry, her answer will be: 
" 
I'll take a 
day off and find out." 
There's many flash sayings, & c. 
If you go out at night and get fearfully tight, 
And try to be one of the gang, 
The chances are great that you'll get in a 
fight, 
And some one will give you a 
bang, 
And when it is morning, you're taken to court, 
And the judge asks what you were about, 
If you don't answer quick, why he surely will say : 
•• 
give you six months to find out." 
There's many flash sayings, & c. 
The great events of the past year, my friends, 
Were the stealing of young Charlie Ross, 
The trial of Beecher, who still wants to pray. 
And the flight of the once famous " Boss." 
And no one can tell where sweet William has gone— 
In fact, it's a 
matter of doubt; 
But if you are anxious to know where he is, 
•• I'll take a 
day off and find out." 
There's many flash sayings, & c.

WHEN I 
BEAT THE BIG BASS DRUM, 
Written by BOBBY NEWCOMD for SAM DEVERE. 
Air.—" When the Band begins to Play." 
I 
once was called head waiter 
In an eating-house saloon: 
But now, if you're observing, 
You can see I've changed my tune 
One day I 
went to Boston, 
To have a 
little fun; 
When they grabbed me for the Jubilee ; 
To play the big bass drum. 
CHORUS. 
For I 
always make a 
rumpus, 
When the big bass drum I 
play, 
The big bass drum I 
play, the big bass drum I 
play: 
The folks they like my music. 
They could listen all the day— 
Especially when they hear me 
And my boom, boom. boom! 
When Strauss he played his waltzes, 
And Gilmore led his band; 
The English, French and Germans, 
All gave him a 
helping hand. 
But in all the foreign countries. 
They couldn't find a 
one. 
To equal this here darkey, 
And his Jubilee bass drum. 
For I 
always, etc. 
THE LITTLE ONES AT HOME. 
As sung with great success by GEO. W. Wxym&y.str--
am thinking now of home among my native hills, 
And though afar through distant lands I 
roam, 
The memories of the past my heart with longing fills. 
To see the darling little ones at home. 
Ah! now their forms I 
seem to see, 
Far o'er the rolling ocean's foam, 
And hear their voices ringing in merry childish gleo, 
Oh! I 
long to see the little ones at home. 
CHORUS. 
The little ones at home, the little ones at home, 
1 
long to see the little ones at home, 
And hear their voices ringing in merry childish gle'.?; 
Oh! I 
long to see the little ones at home. 
LA ST TIME. 
Soon shall I 
hear your voices in merry childish glee; 
Proclaim the joyous welcome welcome home. 
The moon looks mildly down the same as oft before, 
And bathes the earth in floods of mellow light, 
But its beams are not so bright upon this lonely shore, 
As they seemed at home one year ago to night. 
Sadly my heart still turns to thee, 
Wherever I 
may chance to roam, 
I 
hear your voices ringing in merry childish glee; 
Oh! I 
long to see the little ones at home. 
The little ones at horn-, 
May guardian angels still their vigils o'er thee keep. 
May heaven's choicest blessings on thee rest, 
Till I 
am safely borne across the stormy deep, 
And meet again with those t 
love the best " 
Soon, soon your faces I 
shall see, 
Never, never more fr om thee to roam, 
Soon shall I 
hear your voices in merry childish glee. 
Proclaim the i0YOUS welcome, welcome home.

THE MIDNIGHT RANGER, 
rif a 
boy that is fond of a 
midnight lark, 
Some folks call me a 
gay young spark; 
The reason I 
suppose is, my deeds are dark, 
And they call me the Midnight Ranger. 
Music pealing, oft revearng 
O'er my senses softly stealing, 
Gas lamps burning, home returning 
Just before the break of day. 
CHORUS. 
Rollicking about on a 
starlight night, 
Tickling the girls is my 
soul's delight; 
I'm going to be married to Mary Ann White, 
And I 
really believe she's an angel. 
Shouting and bawling with might and main, 
Wetting our gills with bright Champagne, 
I 
never have a 
loss, it's always a 
gain, 
I 
find for the Midnight Ranger. 
Organs grinding, purses finding, 
Hats all batter'd, torn or lost; 
Umbrellas, drunken fellows, 
To the station— fine and costs. 
Rollicking about on a 
starlight night, &c. 
.Each pal I 
have is a 
gay young spark, 
And good for a 
spree when the night is dark; 
Our howling makes the watch-dogs bark, 
And we laugh to scorn all danger. 
Pebbles flinging, homeward singing, 
Wrenching knockers, ringing bells, 
Shutters marking, peelers chaffing, 
Laughing and larking with the girls,

THE MUFFIN NINE. 
Sung by Joux FIELDING. 
OH! Pm going to sing about 
Our greatest national game, 
For I'm a 
muff that just come out, 
With base ball on the brain, 
Our uniform is deep sky red, 
The buttons briptly shine, 
And if you take it in your head, 
Come join the muffin nine. 
CHOR1113. 
Standing in the field, boys, 
Watching for a 
ball, 
Catch 'em on the ground, boys, 
Wherever they may fall, 
The ladies they admire, 
They say I 
am sublime, 
When I 
catch a 
flyer, boys, 
From one of the Muffin Nine. 
'Ile Red Stocking and Chicago clubs, 
We challenge every day, 
They say we're all a 
lot of scrubs, 
Wherever we go to play, 
We do our best to make a 
run, 
They leave us, far bebinl, 
t 
hey whitewash us, oh 1 
just for fun, 
The horrible Muffin Nine. 
Standing in,

With the Mutuals we're a 
match to-day, 
'Twas a 
one-sided affair, 
Fifty cents you had to pay, 
To see the general scene; 
They white-washed us so Mutual, 
Like the French got on the Rhine, 
Of course you know its hard on us, 
One of the Muffin Nine. 
Standing in, ttc. 
We would take a 
traveling tour, 
But stamps is what we lack, 
Of course you know we all are poor, 
And we can't get 'em back, 
Pm captain of the nine, you bet, 
I

For we nay be the champions yet, 
This model Muffin Nine.

Banjo solo as sung by BILLY RAY. 
THIS morning at breakfast the papers I 
read, 
The Herald, the News, and the Times, sirs, 
When a 
very funny notion passed into my head, 
Which I'm going to put into rhymes, sirs. 
thought I 
would read, by way of a 
change, 
The columns across, not as downward they range, 
I 
found all the news and advertisements strange, 
Now I'm going to give you a 
sample. 
There was Wanted a 
Waiter for a 
Coal Yard, 
Theoddre Tilton for Sale Price two Dollars, 
The Latest from Europe, Old Bismarck to Let, 
Use Mrs. Winslow's Soothing Paper Collars; 
Use Cristadoro Hair Dye for Cloaks, Hats and Shawls, 
The night Blooming Cereus for Parties and Balls, 
Spauldings' Glue is recommended for Patent Waterfalls, 
Cut your Corns with the Saratoga Railroad. 
Strayed or Stolen, from Sing Sing direct, 
An End Man Eloped with a 
Banker, 
Barnum wants a 
Place to sell Peanuts, 
And a 
Boy to sweep out‘Boston Harbor; 
Lost on Broadway, near the corner of Grand, 
Twenty-two tons of Coal, Pickled Oysters on Hand, 
Ben Butler on Exchange for Ten Acres of Land. 
The Beecher Scandal still Rages. 
Off, YES! WE ARE GOING HOME.

The poets have sung about women and wine, 
But smoke is the theme of this ditty of mine ; 
I 
look on my pipe as a 
trusty old friend, 
Who's faithful whatever luck fortune may send ; 
Wherever I 
travel, north, east, west or south 
l've always a 
pipe or cigar in my mouth, 
For when I 
am smoking I'm up in a 
cloud, 
But of course, never go where no smoking' 
CHORUS. 
No smoking allow'd, what a 
terrible sell, 
When they put out my pipe I 
am put out as well, 
No smoking allow'd, what a 
terrible sell, 
When they put out my pipe I 
am put out as well, 
One day, by express on the Great Eastern 
I 
started to visit an old friend of mine, 
I'd lighted my pipe, and was watching the curl 
Of the smoke, when there popp'd in a 
pretty young !z:Irl. 
I 
cried " smoking carriage" the train was just oil; 
Of course I 
could not make the dear creature eough, 
So put down my pipe and stanr&sively bow'd 
To my Nei w*Ii I 
Mt wa4 ' No smoki(q.-; 
No talttlir4' 
I 
looked at the ceiling, I 
fear, with a 
frown, 
I 
looked at the lady, of course, she looked down; 
I 
oflered the paper, of weather I 
spoke, 
And talked about steam tho' I 
thought about smoke, 
So charming a 
damsel I'd never seen before, 
But soon I 
admired her fifty times more ; 
One small remark proved she with sense was endowed, 
She said, ' Go on smoking, sir, smoking's allowed.'' 
No smoking allowed, Sze. 
In comfort the rest of the journey was passed, 
I'd met with a 
sensible woman at last, 
And now we are married, I 
oft say in joke; 
Our joys and our sorrows have ended in smoke. 
She knows that those ladies who smoke cannot bear, 
Have husbands who take pipes and glasses elsewhere, 
So ladies pray try to get used to a 
cloud, 
And don't join the cry of " no smoking allowed." 
No smoking allowed, .te.

What ? no ! it cannot be that they've driven 
Their father, so helpless and old, 
(Oh, God, may their crime be forgiven,) 
To perish out here in the cold. 
Oh Heavens, he is sadden'd and weary, 
See the tears how they course down his ^heeks 
Oh, this world it is lonely and dreary, 
And his heart for relief vainly seeks. 
CHORUS. 
For he's old and helpless, and feeble, 
The days of his youth have gone by; 
Then over the hill to the poor house, 
He wanders alone there to die. 
Ah me! on that old doorstep yonder. 
I've sat with my babes on my knee, 
No father was happier or fonder 
Than I 
of my little ones three. 
The boys both so rosy and chubby, 
And Lily with prattle so sweet r 
God knows how their father has loved them. 
But theyy've driven him out in the street. 
For he's old, &a-
It'9 long years since my Mary was taken, 
My faithful, affectionate wife; 
&nee then I'm forlorn and forsaken, 
And the light has died out of my life. 
The boys grew to manhood; he gave them 
A 
ctecl for the farm! aye, and more, 
He gaw them this house they were born in! 
And r_.L.w he's turn'd out from its door. 
For he's old, Jul 
Oh, children! loved children! yet hear me, 
I 
have journeyed along on life's stage; 
With the hope that you all would be near me, 
To comfort and cheer my old age: 
My 
I'd gladly have given, 
To shield nd protect you! but hark! 
Though m3 heart breaks, I'll say it's you've driven 
Me out hse to die in the dark. 
For he's old, &c. 
t3ut, perhaps, they'll live happier without me; 
Farewell, d-or old home, ah! farewell! 
each pathway add tree here about me, 
Some memory precious can tell: 
Well! the flowers will bloom bright as ever, 
And the birds sing as sweet to the morn; 
Then over the hill from the poor house, 
Net Spring the old man shall be borne. 
FQr 1's old,

Oh, George! 
beautiful George! 
Georgie my darling, my love and my charmer! 
Oh, George! 
beautiful George! 
I'd trust him with any youn ,, 
girl, he'd not harm her. 
When the swallows homeward fly, 
And the stars shine in Cie sky, 
'Twixt the sunset and the dark, 
Georgie meets me in the park. 
For Georgie darling now I 
sigh, 
With his lavender kids and his red neck-tie 
CHORUS. 
Oh George! 
beautiful George! 
Georgie my darling, my love and my charmer ! 
Oh, George! beautiful George! 
I'd trust him with any young girl, he'd not harm her. 
Oh, George! 
beautiful George! 
With his light nut-brown hair and his eyes blue and tender, 
Oh, George? 
beautiful George! 
With his pearl-color'd pants and embroidered suspender6 
His flute-like voice so soft and low, 
Straightway to my soul doth go. 
It's ecstasy to hear him say, 
" 
Who's your baby darling, pray ?" 
With his pouting lips, and his teeth of pearls 
And his dimpled chin, just like a 
girl's ! 
chortv..,—Oh. GeorlfP Acc 
Oh, George! 
beautiful George! 
You are my darling, the one I 
love Only. 
Oh, George! 
beautiful George! 
Away from our side I'm down-hearted and lonely. 
At the mask'd ball the other night, 
Ge rgie was the girls' delight; 
The pride and envy of the ball, 
Georgie won the hearts of all. 
With his swan-like neck, and his soft white hands, 
And his melting glances, thus he stands. 
Chorus—Oh, George, U. 
Spoken after chorus to 3d verse--Georgie was a 
remarkably 
pretty child, so his ma says. 
She used to dress his hair in 
long " silken curls" down his back. " Why, what a 
pretty 
girl!" strangers would remark. " That's not a 
girl," his ma 
would say, `• he's a 
boy !" " Indeed, and what's his name?" 
"Georgie"," she would reply; and then they would say "Oh, 
pretty Georgie !" and that used to please his ma so much. Shs 
says, " he's so handy around the house." 
Why he often puts 
on his ma's nice white apron and helps her make pies; and he 
can do " fancy needlework" just as well as any girl. 
His ma 
says he's too pretty for a 
boy, he ought to have been a 
girl. 
His Iva calls him " pretty Georgie." I 
call him "Georgie dear." 
We had a 
private theatrical entertainment up at our house 
the other evening. We played " The Lady of Lyons." I 
played 
" 
Claude," and Georgie played " Pauline," and he did look so 
sweet in his " long white satin trail" and a " blushing rose" 
on his breast. 
He acted like a " queen." and looked every 
inch a " young bride:" and In the " Cottag,e Scene" he sighed 
and made love to the "Prince" just like a. " real girl!" His ma 
called him " Georgiana" all the evening. 
And now, some-
times when we have a 
little " love spat," I 
call him " Georgi-1 
ana," sometimes I 
gall him " sister;" but the dear boy doesn't 
get angry at it. 
He's such a " Sweet fellow," he merely looks 
at me with those " languishing eyes" and playfully exclaims, 
" 
Oh ! you giddy girl, if yen sly that again I 
shall strike you 
real hard !'" 
Which f 
Tees me to exclaim, 
Oh, George! beautiful George! 
Georgie my darling, my love and my charmer! 
Oh, Ge zge I 
beautiful George!

LITTLE MAGGIE MAi, 
THE spring had come, the flowsrs in bloom, 
The birds sung out their lay, 
Down by a 
little running brook, 
I 
first saw Maggie May. 
She had a 
roguish jet black eye, 
Was singing all the day; 
And how I 
loved her none can tell, 
My little Maggie May. 
CHORUS. 
My 
little witching Maggie, 
Maggie singing all the day; 
Oh how I

My little Maggie May 
Though years 'rolled on, yet still I 
loved, 
With heart so light ..nd gay, 
And never will this heart deceive 
My own dear Maggie Islay. 
When others thought that life was gone, 
And death would take away, 
Still by my siTe did linger one— 
And that was Maggie May. 
My 
little witching, &e. 
May heaven protect 1116 for her sake, 
I 
pray both night and day, 
That I, ere long, may call her mine, 
My own dear Maggie May. 
For she is all the world to me, 
Although I'm far away, 
I 
oft times think of the running brool 
And my little Maggie Nay.

O'er the bosom of the ocean, 
Shall the sea-bird cease to rove. 
Sun and stars shall cease their motion, 
Winds and clouds forget to move, 
E're my love for thee shall falter, 
Or my faith forgotten be; 
All things else on earth may alter, 
Still I 
love thee, love but thee.

Joyfully when first I 
found thee, 
Bowed my soul at love's behest; 
Now when sorrows gather round me, 
Thou alone can'st make me blest, 
Be my heart thy throne for ever, 
Let all tears forgotten be; 
Weal or woe es-trange us never, 
Still I 
love thee, love but thee.

BARNEY THE BOLD. 
Written for BARNEY W ILLIAMS, BY MR. GUEST. 
Should the mind be, over-burdened with sorrows or care, 
Should Fortune betray( 
us, or Friendship turn cold, 
What can turn into laughter the groans of despair, 
Like the wit and and 
jestures of Barney the bold; 
With his toe and his heel, and a 
twirl of his stick, 
He'll bate the blue devils at once to ould nick! 
Oh Comedy laughs in ea,ch glance of his eye, 
And his brogue it is sweeter than mountains poteen! 
To match him for humor, in vain ye may try, 
Whilst night follows morning, and noon comes between; 
And " Barney, bold Barney," cry thousands with joy, 
" 
Is the raal spalpane, is our own Irish boy!" 
Come watch him, ye actors, come one and come all! 
flow dull is your wit, and heavy your heels, 
Your efforts are great, but your acting is small, 
And Barney's the boy, all your humbug reveals! 
In the wide world he has not equal in that, 
For Paddy is Barney, and Barney is Pat!

Performed by NILES & EVANS with succesei. 
Oh, when we were two little boys 
Way down in South Canine; 
We used to sing and dance about, 
And with our hands keep time. 
But when we grew up bigger 
We had to work all day, 
And then we never had a 
chance 
To fool around that way. 
CHORUS. 
But, Oh! my! when our work was done—Sym, 
Then was the time that we all went in for fun; 
We used to sing and dance about 
Till Massa made us run, 
But now the times have changed you see, 
Down in our Sunnny Home; 
The Rebellion broke the country up, 
So now we have to roam. 
And what they want to do with US, 
We're sure we do not know, 
Unless to make us Senators 
To send to Idaho.

When he is in need, 
If always ready to help you,

Take your coat up to your uncle, 
And borrow a

He will use you well. 
If you have got a

No matter old or new, 
Take it right up to your uncle, 
He'll loan you a

You'll see a

Who is just getting over a

He's broke, he's spent all his money 
A

He says you k"ow those naughty girls, 
They've cleaned me through and through,

There's the fellow who feels pretty lucky, 
To make a

Goes into the faro bank smiling, 
Comes out with a

He says that's what I 
call tough luck, 
Not enough to buy a

I'll take my coat up to Iny uncle, 
And borrow a

The Gal' with the Striped Stockings on. 
(New air.) 
Words and music by SAM DEVERE. 
Copyrighteil 1876, by A. J. FISHER, 98 Nassau St., New York. 
'Twas a 
rainy day, I'll nere' forget, 
The prettiest girl that ever I 
met, 
And as she raised her dress from the wet, 
I 
saw she had striped stockings on. 
The stripes were red, and upon my soul, 
her shanks were the cut of a 
barber's pole, 
In the heel of one stocking was a 
great big hole, 
The gal with the striped stockings on. 
CHORUS. 
She's always out when the wind blows high, 
If the weather is wet, she'll walk or die, 
Raises her dress as she goes by, 
This gal with the striped stockings on. 
When I 
saw her zebra stockings there, 
I 
could do nothing but stand and stare, 
But quickly she became aware 
That I 
saw her striped stockings on. 
She blushed the color of a 
red, red rose, 
Then dropped her eyes, and then her clothes, 
Said, ain't you awful! I 
suppose 
You saw my striped stockings on. 
She's always out, &C. 
I 
liked her style, and thought I'd tell her, 
She says well now you're a 
real nice feller, 
I 
escorted her home under my umbrella, 
This gal with the striped stockings on. 
At last we parted in the rain, 
She said she hoped we'd meet again, 
She left and took my watch and chain, 
The gal with the striped stockings on. 
She's always out, Izz. 
MORAL CHORUS. 
So now when you see a

With peppermint candy stockings on her pretty little feet, 
Remember I

Copyrighted 1S76, by A. J. FISHER, OS Nassau St., New York, 
There's a

His name is Theophilus Aristides Brown. 
With weak-minded females he's gained some renown. 
This sweet- scented handsome young man. . 
He's as dainty as a 
butterfly, and in colors as gay, 
And flutters from corner to corner all day. 
He's too sweet for anything, that's what the girls say. 
Of this sweet- scented handsome young man.

He wears a 
red neck- tie, his compleation is fair, 
Straight down from.the middle he parts his blonde hair. 
He skips o'er the gutter like a 
thing made of air, 
This sweet-scented handsome young man. 
There's a 
few straggling hairs upon his upper lip, 
His legs are the size of a 
two cent tallow dip. 
He looks like a 
chicken that's just had the pip, 
This sweet- scented handsome young man. ' 
If caught in the rain he would surely expire, 
Gotten up expressly for girls to admire. 
He could jump through a 
sieve without touching a 
wire. 
Could this sweet-scented handsome young man. 
He wears a 
red neck tie. lc. 
To break the girls' hearts is Lis object 'twould seem. 
By day its his hobby, by night its his dream: 
His chief food is sponge cake, root beer and ice cream, 
This sweet- scented dainty young man. 
Such eriminate young men may be all vei7 fine. 
Their auention all clear headed girls will decline 
I'll be darn'd if he could marry any sister of mine. 
No such sweet- scented handsome young man.

He seems such a

He's known both near and far, 
He carries in his han& a

He's conductor on a

And he's got such a

When he helps the ladies to a

They blush and say, oh my.

As he goes through the car to collect his farce, 
Of stamps he carries a 
bunch, 
And he never was known to knock down a 
cent, 
For he carries a 
patent bell punch. 
He says as he waltzes through with a 
smile, 
Your fares now if you please, 
Then he plays you a 
tune on the patent bell punch, 
And he makes yotir change with eaie. 
He alivays keeps his weather eye peeled; 
For the people that he thinks will ride, 
And he's always got that same old cry, 
There's plenty of room inside. 
As he goes through, kA 
Move right up, there's plenty of room

And he packs you in like an old sardine,

FEARFULLY AND WONDERFULLY MADE, 
BANJO SOLO. 
(New air.) 
Written and composed by SAM DEVERE. 
Deception just now is the rule all around, 
Its practiced in all shades of life; 
Just mind what I 
say, and be careful my friends, 
When the time comes to pick out a 
wife. 
Her eyes may be loving, her smile may be sweet, 
When you anproach her she's timid and afraid; 
Be careful look well before making the leap, 
You don't know how the dear girl is made. 
In the good days of old, in our grand-mothers' time, 
Girls did'nt enamel or paint; 
Didnt' wear palpitators their bosoms to swell, 
Didnt' lace themselves up till they'd faint; 
Didn't wear patent calves, or use bloom of youth, 
And the rose in their cheeks di'dnt fade: 
You must know a 
girl well now before you get stuck, 
For she's fearfully and wonderfully made. 
Girls long ago didnt' pencil their brows, 
Use lotions to make the skin fair; 
The girls long ago combed the hair on their heads, 
Now its combed on the back of a 
chair. 
I 
got more to tell when I 
see you alone, 
I 
have said too much here I'm afraid, 
But betore you get married, examine them well, 
For they're fearfully and wonderfully made.

" 
A 
Little Book has lately appeared in print at Mr. A. 
J. 
FISHER'S, 98 Islas-
' 
sau street ca led the • Little Flirt." We cannot say that we recommend 
it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, as we think it would only 
encourage the bad habit of " flirting." 
Unfortunately, there is enough 
of it done without any further necessity of explaining " how, when and 
loh,ere to do it," and this little volume would advise and initiate the un-
corrupted in practicing what is commonly called "flirtinig.'• 
The N. sr. Eeening Telegram writes: " We have lately seen a 
neat little 
book, bound in Morocco leather, costing twenty-five cents, called the 
"Little Flirt," published by A. 
J. 
FISHER, No. 98 Nassau street. 
It 
gives information of the modus operandi of flirting, and of the meaning 
of every motion of the handkerchief, fan, glove and parasol. 
As there 
is nothing at all objectionable in the volume, and its contents might af-
ford some innocent amusement to many, we do not hesitate to recom-
mend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers."

of Harlequin, in his tesselated suit • the next only Columbine, thee

American Fortune-Telling Cards.—This is the old-

These Cards are arranged and printed in series—Hearts, Clubs, Dia-

and K 
for Knave, and numbers 1, 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
four rows, and are to be read according to directions. Many of the an-
swers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under-
standing. Many professional Fortune-Tellers use these cards, and we 
are in receipt of letters in relation to them from all parts of the U. S.

Courting Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too diftl. 
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unlady-like encourage-
ment- As a 
result of this dilemma, manylives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties
