TAKE 1T JAKE. 
Written and Sung by C. L. DAVIS. 
Now gentle folks it vos my turn to appear. 
Of course you know dot ven you all see me here, 
Von I

You all vant to know vot so color my nose. 
Veil, to color my nose, many dollars I 
pay! 
You go ask my vife, und I

CHORUS. 
"Lager bier, lager bier, aint it queer, lager bier," 
Dot's vot dey says vos the matter mit me, 
Lager bier, lager bier. 
Oh dear I

spree. 
"Take it Jake, take take it Jake, for my sake, take

Dot's vet my friends viii say to me, 
" 
Take it Jake, take it Jake, take it Jake, for my 
sake." 
Lager bier vos good ven you go on a 
spree. 
Dfar's no use in talking but lager vos good, 
Too much, and you don't den vos able to stood. 
You drink twenty glasses and you feel den so fine, 
You don't get some headache like von you drink wine, 
Veil, Saturday nIght von my vages I

Drink lots of lager, but do not drink too much, 
Don't link you can tackle it some as the Dutch ; 
Because if you ao mit too much get away, 
You're certain and sure to hear the boys say : 
Cuonus. 
"Cheese it Jake, cheese it Jake, ease it Jakeseize it

Dem little boys never do von't let me be.

" 
Take it Jake, take it Jake, take it Jake, for my

THE DITCHER 'SWELL.

Feeding the Ducks on the Farm.. 
Written and Composed by C. 
L. 
DAVIS. 
Sung with. 
great success, by Vic B.EYNOLDS. 
It's just one year ago to-day, 
Since I 
fir - t 
fell in love 
With a 
charming little fellow, 
Who calls me his turtle-dove. 
He asked me if I'd take a 
walk, 
And ofiered me his rm ; 
And said he would show me 
How to feed the ducks that's on the farm. 
Cnonrs. 
Feeding the ducks on the farm, Quack ! Quack! 
Feeding the ducks on the farm, Quack! Quack! 
His style is so neat, and he looked so sweet, 
While feeding the ducks on the farm, Quack! Quack! 
He has asked me to become his wife— 
I 
don't know what to say; 
He says I 
will make him happy 
If I 
wdl name the wedding day. 
I 
think that I 
shall answer yes! 
And to his sorrow put an end ; 
And when we move on the farm 
My a,istance I 
can lend. 
While feeding the ducks, &

Who'd. a 
Thought of Seeing You? 
When strolling out we often meet 
With those we least expect ; 
Perhaps some old, old friend, whose face 
You can scarcely recollect ; 
Your pardon, sir— is your name Smith ? 
Yes, sir : well, my name's Jones ! 
Then joyfully you greet him, in 
The liveliest of tones— 
Cllours. 
Who'd a 
thought of seeing you? 
Gracious me ! how do you do ? 
Do I 
make a 
great mistake ? 
Or is it, really, you ? 
A 
poor man, all at once, has money 
Left to him by will, 
Which lifts him from the bottom 
To the summit of the hill ; 
He moves in best society, 
With lots of cash to spend ; 
But this should be his first greeting, with 
An old and seedy friend— 
Who'd a 
thought, 47e. 
A 
man of sixty marries, too, 
A 
girl of seventeen ; 
He has money—she has none— 
The end is quickly seen. 
One night he goes home rather soon, 
And thinks how pleased she'll be ; 
But finds his precious wife upon 
Another fellow's knee ! 
Who'd a 
thought, Sce.. 
Just fancy getting married, on, 
Say—fifty dollars per year — 
Minus friends—ditto, cash. 
You'l soon repent, I 
fear, 
'When in due course it happens, that, 
To crown your everlasting joy, 
You find you are the father of 
A 
bouncing little boy ! 
Who'd a 
thought of seeing you? 
Gracious me ! how do you do ? 
Do I 
make a 
great mistake ? 
Or is it, really, you? 
Written and Sung by C. L. 
DAVIS. 
I'll tell you of a 
fellow, 
Of a 
fellow I 
have seen ; 
Who is neither white nor yellow, 
But is altogether green ; 
And his name it is not charming, 
It is only common Bill; 
And he wishes me to wed him, 
But I 
hardly think I 
will. 
Oh ! he whispered of devotion, 
Of devotion true and deep, 
And it seem'd so very silly 
That I 
almost fell asleep. 
And he thinks it would be pleasant 
As we journey down the hill, 
To go hand in hand together, 
But I 
hardly think I 
will. 
He has told me of a 
cottage, 
Of a 
cottage 'mong the trees ; 
And don't you think the fellow 
Tumbled down upon his knees; 
While the tears the creature wasted 
Were enough to turn a 
mill; 
And he begged me to accept him— 
But I 
hardly think I 
will. 
He was here last night to see me, 
But he made so long a 
stay, 
I 
began to think the blockhead 
Never meant to go away; 
At first I 
learned to hate him, 
And I 
know I 
hate him still ; 
Yet he urges me to wed him, 
But I 
hardly think I 
will. 
I'm sure I 
would not choose him, 
But the very deuce is in it ; 
For he says, if I 
refuse him, 
He could not live a 
minute. 
Now you know the blessed bible 
Plainly says, we must not kill. 
So I've thought the matter over, 
And—I 
rather think I 
will.

WE often read of the power 
Of princes and of kings. 
Who stripp'd of all their grandeur, 
Are but poor mortal things; 
But there's a 
power stronger, 
Which lasts for time untold, 
To which all men must bow and that's 
The bright, bright 
Cum:us. 
Gold, Gold, Gold: I 
love to hear it 
Gold. Gold, Gold ! its power is unto_ . 
We men strive hard to store it, 
And woman she'll adore it. 
The best friend that a 
man can have is 
Gold, Gold, Gold 
The man that's minus money, 
The world will cell a 
fiat: 
And pass him by. but if ne's rich,

It sneers at the unlucky, 
But smiles on he who wins, 
And gold will gloss and cover, 
Quite a 
multitude of sins.

The maid both plain and ancient, 
Appears a

If rich, her gold magnetic draws

It causes strife and pride,

blessing, 
When its properly applied.

Love and content in a

I've heard of, so have you,

And don't begin for to doubt me; 
I

bit o' land, 
There's no common stock about me. 
I

And left with heaps of lore; 
And came out here to this free land, 
Just pravious to the war. 
CHORUS. 
Roger O'Malley, that's my name,. 
Quite famous I 
have grown; 
I'm far superior to Muldoon, 
Mulcahey or Malone. 
I'm quite independent in my way, 
High-ton'd and well educated; 
All my taxes I'm ready for to pay, 
And I'm not in the least dissipated.

drink, and smoke a

With comfort and delight; 
But you'll never see me loafin' round

Like all my seven generations; 
With a 
good deal of Lirning in my mind, 
Which I 
use on important Occasions;

That fling their names all round, 
And the:,-'

For I'm sensible and sound.

YOU may talk about your dashing blondes, 
And lovely brunettes gay; 
But there's none so fair that can compare 
With my Belle of Pleasure Bay. 
She's only seventeen years oh, and has such modest grace, 
'Twould do you good, indeed it would, to see her smiling face, 
And hear her little prattling tongue, 
Would steal your heart away. 
Tier feet are small, and she's not tall, 
My Belle of Pleasure Bay. 
CHORUS. 
We first met, ' twas in summer, 
(BREAK.) 
And for life I 
think I've won her. ( nuEAK..) 
You may talk about your dashing blondes,: 
And lovely brunettes gay; 
-But there's none so fair that can compare, 
With my Belle of Pleasure Bay, 
Of course I've rivals by the score, 
Who think that her they'll win; 
They praise her hair but she don't care, 
She's not to be taken in. 
She treats them all with kind respect but; says she must refuse, 
For gold nor land can win her hand, from the lover she did 
choose. 
So soon we'll married be, and then 
I'll bring her here some day. 
And then with me, you \yin agree 
She's the Belle of Pleasure Bay.

Never to take a

And that's my blessed beer. 
Deprive me of whatever you like, 
But don't stop my beer. 
The other day. not feeling well, 
I

He frowned, and said you want to stop, 
I 
soon knew what he meant; 
Said he, you must give up the drink, 
Said I, oh, doctor dear, 
I'll drink your medicine by the quart, 
But pray don t 
stop my beer, 
You can g) and marry my mother-in-law, 
But don't stop my beer. 
I 
fell in love with a

A

I 
asked her if she'd be my wife, 
She said of course, my dear; 
But you must give up one bad fault, 
I 
began to feel quite queer, 
said, I'll do whatever you like, 
But let me have my beer, 
I'd stand on my head, till nearly dead, 
But pray don't stop my beer.

TO a 
ball I 
vone night was invided, 
And being so fond of de dance, 
At de brosbeet I 
felt gwide delighted, 
Und eagerly gumped at de chance, 
Dere VOS ladies dressed ub so stylish, 
Und as I 
had on a 
vite vest, 
I 
vas indroduced to a 
lady, 
Whom I 
thought outrivaled the rest. 
S
POKEN :—Yes, mid my friendt introduced me in dis sdyle 
" 
Mr. Sharlie Unkelstein, allow me to introduce you to Miss 
Anne Conder." I 
said: " 'Tabby to meet me, madame," und 
just as my friend vas leaving its togedder, he said to me : 
You've got de belle of de ball, Sharlie, 
You've got de belle of de ball,- Sharlie, 
You've got de bello of de ball, Sharlie, 
You'vo got de belle of de ball. 
De envy of all de fair dancers, 
She had such a 
fairy like grace, 
But yust in de midst of de hinders, 
De lady turned plack in de face, 
She gurgled, she gasped, and she hollered, 
Den took hold de tails of my coat, 
De top teeth of dis elegant lady, 
had subbed down her beautiful droat. 
51 
SPOKEN—Yell, I 
vosn't mad because she had a 
false (both

Ho! not I

Besides, yust den anoder vone 
of my friends came ub und said-
-You've got de belle, Sc. 
She retired and ven she recovered, 
In a 
quadrille I 
next took her hand, 
Yen a 
look in her eyes I 
discovered, 
Vich somehow I 
could not understand; 
Tier eyes vere as straight:as a 
needle, 
Yen I 
gazed at dem fondly 1;efore, 
But now von eye looked ub at de ceilinr1 
Und de oder looked down on de floor. 
SroKEN—Yes, dot's a 
fact, but 1 
vant to say anyding, 
so I 
kept on dancing, ven all of a 
sudden her vig fell off, und she 
was bald-headed, den her wax ear commenced to melt, und fell 
off too. 
She looked as if she vos going to faint, so I 
dook hold 
of her arm to lead her to a 
seat, ven off came de left arm. 
Dot 
VOs too much for me, so I 
run down stairs, got my hat und 
coat, und vent home, und venever I meet any of my friends 
now, dey alvays holler afder me, mid say : 
How is your belle of de ball, Sharlie ?

To those who have never perused the sad story of CHAR. 
LOTTE TEMPLE, joyed with her in her early pleasures, sym-
pathized and wept with her in her sorrows, and glowed 
with indignation at the wrongs which she suffered from. 
base, calculating villains, an opportunity is afforded of 
reading one of the most absorbing works ever written, 
proving " truth stranger than fiction." 
The poet's lines are but a 
just description of the unfor. 
Sumac Charlotte Temple: 
Her form was faultless, and her mind, 
Untainted yet by art, 
Was noble, just, humane and kind, 
And virtue warmed her heart. 
But, ah! the cruel spoiler came—" 
This book, in the language of Mrs. Rowson, " affords a 
striking example that vice, however prosperous in the be-
tinning, in the end leads only to misery and shame."

misfortunes of Charlotte Temple, with that auscrb-
ing interest which is inseparable from Mrs. Row-
son's writings, can rest satisfied while denying them-
selves a 
perusal cf the life of Charlotte Temple's 
Daughter, Lucy remplc. 
It is a

pathy, and consolations which those arcund us 
" 
can neither give nor take awoy." 
It contrasts in 
living colors the ri-3hest fruits of virtue and happi-

disappointments and =it resulting from once yizld-
ing to the seductive influence of passion. 
It points a

THE APPRENTICE, 
OR 
First Book for Mechanics, Machinists & Engineers 
By OLIVER B'YRNE.

-2mo., cloth. $ 1.50. 
ENDORSEMENTS OF THE PRESS. 
The highest praise which can be given to this excellent 
elementary work on practical mechanics, consists in the fol-
lowing simple statement of facts : The editor of this journal, 
while teaching natural philosophy and chemistry in the 
Cooper Institute from 1859 to 1864, was in need of a 
text-
book of practical mechanics, adapted to the advanced classes 
who had been trained in mathematics; in his search among 
the many mechanical text- books, there was not one which so 
fully answered his requirements as the above work. 
It was 
therefore adopted and used with perfect satisfaction, and it 
is with pleasure that he receives it now as an old friend from 
the publishers, gives it his most ea-nest recommendation, 
awl wishes it in the hands of all who are still in the fog about 
thc, units of work, calculation of the power of machinery, 
reistance to motion, strain on material, etc.—.11anufacturer 
and Builder, July, 1874. 
,,The author of this work is well known as an extensive 
writer who has r_:ade some valuable additions to American 
technical literature, enumerated above in detail. 
The work 
we are now noticing is a 
theoretical treatise on practical me-
chanics, designed to supply a 
recognized . deficiency. 
Most 
of the works on mechanics treat the subject in a manner 
which is not available to young men commencing as appren-
tices in shops. 
Any young man with a 
fair knowledge of 
arithmetic may, however, use this work to great advantage ; 
it is not only suitable for a 
text- book, but also as a 
k 
of reference. 
Most ambitions young men will make them-
selves so familiar with its contents as to be able to it fer 
readily to any portion of the book. 
The author has adopted 
a 
new notation to distinguish units of work from other units, 
which is not without value, and might be advantageously 
introduced into more ambitious works. 
The book is well 
printed on good white p 
ter. and bound in stiff cloth covers.
