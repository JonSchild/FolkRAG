The Wonderful Star. 
Written by CHARLES J 
EROM E, and sung with great success in the original 
musical sketch, " Comedy." 
I 
am an actor, you see, and you will agree 
That I 
am a 
wonderful star ; 
My appearance is fine, they say I'm divine, 
And I'm sought after near and far. 
The managers say that I'll have my day, 
They can't tell how far off it may be ; 
They know very well, but they don't like to tell, 
I'm the finest they ever did see. 
CHORUS. 
So don't you forget that I'll show them vet 
That I 
am away above par ; 
And I'm sure you will say, on some future day, 
That I 
am a " wonderful star." 
I've got letters here from managers " rpecr " 
That have heard of my talent before ; 
In their letters they say at night I'm t play, 
And take checks at the gallery door. 
And some \van t 
to know if I'll join a 
show 
Where my salary is paid in advance ; 
To the " props " must attend, and sit on the " end," 
And also do a 
good song and dance. 
So don't you forget, & c. 
But I 
do not fear, the day will be here 
When my name they will often repeat ; 
And I'll show them all that I've got the " gall," 
Count Joannes will take a 
back seat. 
Dr. Landis, old boy, will no more annoy, 
For he'll have to pack up and go West ; 
And then you will see that out of the three 
The " wonderful star " is the best. 
So don't you forget, &c. 
Words and music by CHARLES J 
ERONI E. TO 
my little friend, PAULINE 
AMES. 
In a 
little cottage down the road, 
Close by a 
running stream, 
Dwells a 
maiden fair, with golden hair, 
tier age is sweet sixteen. 
How many happy hours I've passed 
Beneath the old oak tree, 
With this little darling by my side, 
So happy, gay, and free. 
CHORUS. 
But the happy day will soon be here ( Sym.) 
When I 
shall wed this little dear ; ( Sym.) 
The marriage bells will toll so sweet, 
And the little birds sing with glee, 
To remind us of the hours we've passed 
Beneath the old oak tree. ( Dance.) 
Now when I've wed this little 
And she's my darling wife, 
In a 
little cottage by the stream 
I'll settle down for life. 
With this little maiden by my side 
I'll ever happy be, 
And we'll often pass the hours away 
Beneath the old oak tree. 
But the happy day, Scc,.

Let my Name be Kindly Spoken. 
Words by SAMUEL N. 
M ITCHELL. 
Music by II. P. DARKS. 
Sung by 
ELLA JEROME with great success in the sketch " Jealousy." 
Let my name be kindly spoken 
When you're far away from me, 
And although the vows are broken 
I 
will fondly speak of thee. 
All the scenes of days departed 
I'll endeavor to forget, 
And if you are broken-hearted, 
Think not of the days we met. 
CHORUS. 
Let my name be kindly spoken 
When you're far away from me, 
And although the vows are broken 
I 
will fondly speak of thee. 
In the past we loved each other, 
Loved each other fond and true ; 
And I'll never find another 
That can take the place of you. 
Tho' I 
wander on for ever, 
Seeking lands beyond the sea, 
Well I 
know that I 
shall never 
Never find the like of thee. 
Let my name, & c. 
If the fate should bid me meet you 
At some far-off distant day. 
I 
would fondly kiss and greet you 
In the old familiar way. 
Tho' the binding link is broken, 
It is sweet to part as friends, 
And the farewell word that's spoken 
To the heart a 
sweetness lends. 
Let my name, & c.

Now my Soul am Happy. 
Written and composed by W. C. H owARD, and sung with great success 
by CHAVLES JERONIE. 
Oh, mourners come and join the band, 
Now my soul am happy. 
March right on to Canaan's land, 
Now my soul am free. 
The angel Gabricl's coming round, 
Now my soul am happy. 
Don't you hear his trumpet sound ? 
Now my soul am free. 
Then shout on, mourners, now my soul am happy; 
Then shout on, sinners, now my soul am free. 
[REPEAT.] 
The land of Canaan's close at hand, 
Now my soul am happy. 
The Savior he has got command, 
Now my soul am free. 
We'll cross the river on a 
raft, 
Now my soul am happy. 
So jump on board the blessed craft, 
Now my sctul am free. 
Then shout on, &c. 
If a 
man is rich or he is poor, 
Now my soul am happy. 
If he don't shout he'll suffer sure, 
Now my soul am free. 
Good Si. Peter guards the gates, 
Now my soul am happy. 
If you don't mind you'll be too late, 
Now my soul am free. 
Then shout on, &c.

Looking for Dates. 
Written by CHARLES JERomE for his friend EMILE AMES. 
Good morning, Mr. Agent, 
Anything new to-day ? 
Heard fr on his Nibs in Boston, 
What did he have to say? 
What ! says he never heard of us ? 
Well, he must have a 
cheek ; 
We've been together for the last ten years, 
And never lost a 
week. 
Cull we have the finest wardrobe, 
And all our acts are new. 
My partner he can do the flip, 
And I 
can done, too ; 
Our breakneck biz it is immense, 
We're sure to kill them dead ; 
My pard he turns a 
double, 
And stands right on his head. 
We also do a 
double cloq, 
Or on the end can sit ; 
I 
know all the funny gags, 
And my partner does the split. 
We also do an Irish act, 
And I 
can walk a 
rope, 
Do straight biz for a 
stump speech, 
And we furnish oar own soap. 
I 
can sing a 
ballad, dance a ! ling, 
Or do the man fish act ; 
I 
work in dramas, l'm a 
funny clown, 
I 
can split them up the back. 
So that must be a 
mistake, 
Or the salary is too high ; 
You can't be up with (tunics 
Who think they are too fly. 
So just drop him another line 
And tell him what we do, 
And if you can't catch a 
hundred, 
Take twenty for the two. 
On the Road. 
Written Ly CHARLES F. JERomE. 
I 
tell you it's no use talking, boys, I'm going to stop right here, 
I've had no money for the last three weeks, and the " man-
ager" I 
think is queer ; 
Now, what's the old guy giving us, when he says he's got no 
money ? 
I'm sure the house was good last night, so he needn't get so 
funny. 
Why, the hotel man is kicking, and the board hill's up to- day, 
So if it's not settled by this evening, we'll have to skip away ; 
And the Chinese laundry's got my washing—I've only got one 
collar— 
And he says that he won't give them up, for I 
owe him just 
one dollar. 
So let us go and strike his nibs, and see what we can do, 
Tell him we must have some wealth, and we may catch a 
case or two. 
And if he doesn't give it up, we'll not go on to-night, 
For he cannot do without us, boys, so we have him dead to 
rights ; 
Just tell the song and dance men what we are going to do, 
And tell them not to wash up until they get their money, too. 
And tell that " serio-comic queen " she'd better write for dates, 
Or we'll put her up for a 
walking match against her rival— 
" 
Kitty Bates." 
Also that snide Dutch actor, he need not he afraid, 
If he gets left upon the road, he can go and learn a 
trade. 
So the best thing, boys, that we can do, is to try and stop this 
" 
beat," 
For he may think, as others do, that actors never cat ; 
And I 
know that I 
eat regular—that is, when I'm at home, 
And when I 
strike that good old spot, I 
never more will roam,

The Masher. 
Written by CHARLES JEROME. 
Who is it that we meet each clay 
On the Bowery, or Broadway, 
That dresses in a 
style so gay? 
The Masher. 
Who is it that is on the mash, 
In his pockets you will find no cash, 
And he often goes without his hash ? 
The Masher. 
Who smiles upon tive girls so sweet 
Whenever he meets them on the street, 
And his washerwoman he is sure to beat ? 
The Masher. 
Who is it knows the free lunch route, 
Where he cats his fill and then gets out, 
And says high living gives him the gout? 
The Masher. 
Who is it that often makes the remark 
lie spends hundreds of dollars while out on a 
lark, 
And for the want of a 
bed has to sleep in the Park? 
The Masher. 
PRETTY LITTLE 
TOMMY, 
Written and sung by BEN DODGE. 
One afternoon as down the street I 
rambled, 
My attention was attracted by a 
crowd 
Of people, who with open mouths were list'ning 
To some language, which to me seemed very loud; 
It issued from a 
chap upon the corner, 
A 
fellow who was overstocked with cheek, 
he'd a 
little rubber toy which he was selling, 
And he said it was a " Tommy with a 
squeak." 
SPOREN.—He pulled a 
string, causing the little rubber 
toy to move its arms and legs in a 
ridiculous min ner, and 
at the same time to utter a 
very peculiar little Equeak; then 
the gentleman would turn round to his audience and say--
CHORUS. 
Will you buy a 
little Tommy with a 
squeak, squeak, 
squeak, 
Pull it for a 
week it will squeak, squeak, squeak ; 
Buy a 
little Tommy with a 
squeak, squeak, squeak, 
Pretty little Tommy with a 
squeak. 
I 
purchased one, it was so very funny 
That I 
couldn't keep it hidden but of sight, 
At home we had a 
little boy in trowsers, 
Who had suffering been, and crying all the night ; 
And the cause, I 
found, of all his youthful sorrow 
WaS, he'd had the stomach-ache for near a 
week, 
But he laughed so loud, the pain at once departed, 
When I 
let him take the " Tommy with a 
squeak." 
Will you buy, etc, 
For some time I 
have sojourned in this city, 
And of course I 
have been looking out for fun, 
I've desired with the girls to get acquainted, 
But they " turn me the cold shoulder "— every one ; 
There is one by whom I 
have been captivated, 
And though to gain her notice I 
did seek, 
She somehow frowned on all of my advances, 
Till I 
showed the little " Tommy with a 
squeak !" 
SPOKEN.—That " broke the ice," for she turned around 
with an angelic smile and murmured— 
Pretty little Tommy, etc. 
Now advice in this matter I 
will give you, 
And I'm certain you will find it true indeed, 
If you try, and cannot win a 
girl's affections, 
Buy a 
little rubber toy, and you'll succeed ; 
For if when to plead your cause you would endeavor, 
Should the lady blush and hang her head so meek, 
She'll quickly smile and whisper yes so sweetly, 
When you show the little " Tommy with a 
squeak !" 
Will you buy, etc.

SKELLY. 
Sung by the Bra num,. 
Copyright, 1876, by and Music, to be ha,d of E. H. IlAuDING. 229 Bowery, 
New York, 
Last night I 
was out rather late— 
"r was only an innocent spree— 
My wife for my coming did wait, 
When sleeping I 
thought she would be ; 
I 
found her in temper and tears; 
" 
Oh," she cried, " it's a 
sin and a 
shame!" 
And she scratched both my eyes and my ears; 
But I 
told her I 
soon would explain. 
Cnonus.---The " Club " had a 
meeting to- night, love, 
Of bus'ness we had a 
great sight love; 
Don't think for a 
moment I'm tight, love, 
I ' we only been down to the " Club. -
My boots I 
left down in the hall, 
And softly I 
crept up the stairs; 
I 
kept rather close to the wall, 
And thought to ascend unawares; 
But just as I 
got to the door, 
I 
seemed to get lost in the dark; 
I 
stumbled and fell on the floor, 
And just then I 
could only remark— 
CRollus.—The " Club" had, etc. 
She sobbed and she wept and she screamed, 
Angl said she'd go back to her Ma; 
While I 
on the mantel- piece leaned, 
And tried to enjoy my cigar. 
I 
promised to buy her a 
dress 
If she 'd 
let me alone for awhile ; 
Then I 
gave her a 
sweet little kiss, 
And I 
saw her beginning to smile. 
SPOKEN.—So I 
thought it a 
favorable opportunity to 
assure her once more, as a 
positive fact, that— 
CHOIUTS.—The " Club" had, etc.

OLD BROWN'S DAUGHTER. 
THERE lives an ancient party, 
At the other end of town, 
lie keeps a 
little chandler's shop, 
His ahcient name is Brown ; 
lie's got an only daughter, 
Such a 
party I 
ne'er saw, 
13y jingo, I 
should like to be 
That old chap's son-in-law. 
CHORUS. 
Old Brown's daughter's a 
proper sort of girl 
Old Brown's daughter's as fair as any pearl, 
I 
wish I 
was the Lord Mayor, a 
Marquis, or Iti• Rah, 
I'm Wowed if I 
wouldn't marry old Brown's girl. 
Old Brown now he sells very nearly 
Everything you'd please, 
Treacle, soap, and bundles of wood, 
Lollypops and cheese; 
His daughter minds the shop, 
It's a 
treat to see her serve, 
rd like to run away with hers 
But I 
haven't got the nerve. 
Old Brown's daughter, &a. 
Poor old Brown, he's very often, 
Troubled with the gout, 
He " grumbles" in the little parlor 
When be can'tg,et9141 
15 
Then I 
go and make a 
purchase, 
0! and when she hands th change, 
That gal makes me jedyaLvanized, 
I 
feel so very strange. 
Old Brown's daughter, &e. 
Miss Brown she smiles so sweetly, 
When I 
say a 
tender word, 
But old Brown says that she shall wed 
A Marquis or a 
Lord; 
But I 
don't think as ever 
One of them swells I 
shall be, 
But, by jingo ! next election 
I 
shall put up for M. 
SPOKEN.—I 
shall then get in the house of COMMOHS, Whith 
i3 only next door to the Lords. " Who'll vote br Scroggins ?

Of Course It's No Business of Mine. 
Written and sung lry 11AnitY EVE, the Successful English Comic. 
SOME people they say that I'm curious, and tell me I 
never refuse, 
Ni) matter front whence I 
obtain it, in getting the latest of 
lleVVS. 
Well, I 
certainly own that I 
do so, and therein is no harm 
I 
opine, 
Whatever I 
hear I 
keep close, for of course it's no business 
of mine. 
Lltepeat.] 
For instance, at Mrs. Montgomery's, a 
gent with a 
big black 
moustache, 
Calls there most every evening, and for Mrs. Montgomery 
does ask. 
Ile stays till half-pist eight o'clock; Montgomery gets 
home about nine, 
Now I'd like to know what he does there, but of course it's 
no business of mine. [ Repeat.] 
Now, I 
met young Miss Smith ' tether ev'ning, she was 
taking a 
nice country walk, 
And as soon as she spied me she did commence for to have 
a 
long talk, 
All about her dear little nephew who, she says, is between 
ekr,lit and nine, 
Some say that it isn't her nephew, but of course it's no bus-
iness of mina [ Repeat.] 
At Mrs. Fitzgibbons, the baker's, tlw people are raising 
din, 
They say that she won't pr; her rent, So the sheriff and 
auctioneer's in— 
I 
can't tell what she does with her money, though Ms nose 
like a 
lighthouse does shine, 
S.mie say that she spends it for whiskey, but of course it's 
no business of mine. [ Repeat.] 
Perhaps the song you have just heard, you do not think iF 
worthy of praise, 
On the safe si he. my friends I 
have erred, for a 
laugh i 
I 
have 
hut tried to raise. 
If you're pleased I 
will sing you another if you call on me 
some other time, 
if a 
it pleased my advice to you is, of course, it's no 
'less of mine.

ON SUNDAY EVE AT EIGHT, 
Then Sunday evening came, and I 
On the corner, there, did wait, 
Where soon she met me and walk'd 
Thro' the Park until quite late ; 
We whisper'd words so low and sweet, 
For she's my darling " Kate 
We said good-night, to Yueet again 
On Sunday eve at eight. 
CHORUS. 
Oh ! how my heart did palpitate, 
As I 
linger'd near the gate, 
She's the fairest one in all the town, 
Some day she'll be my bride, 
I 
never can forget the day 
I 
first walk'd by her side. 
At a 
ball we went, and by my side 
Was my darling, fond and true ; 
We danced and spoke of the future bright, 
She said, " I 
love but you." 
I 
asked her to become my bride, 
She whisper'd 
Yes," when will it be? 
As I 
lingered near the gate ; 
• ' Next Sunday eve at eight." 
CHORUS. 
Oh ! how my heart did palpitate, 
As I 
linger'd near the gate, 
She's the fairest one in all the town, 
Some day she'll be my bride , 
I 
never can forget the day 
Drst walk'd by her side.

N Comic Duet. Written by 11.A1021' M ONTAGUE, and sung by MISg 
CARRIE D UNCAN and Hanity M ONTAGUE with great success. 
ITE—T tell you it's too had, I 
tell you it's a 
shame, 
For I've been nearly mad since first your mother came; 
She came here on a 
visit, she said she'd stay a 
week, 
Itut she's been here a 
year or more-- I 
never saw such 
cheek. 
I 
Early, what are you about ? 
IT E—So 
now I 
give you warning, 
She toe, to-morrow; morning. 
1HE—T Tarry ! 
ITE —Carrie, I'll turn your mother out. 
SHE---- So, sir, at last it's come to this, and I 
must plainly 
speak : 
No longer will I 
be so dumb, no longer I'll be meek ; 
You have no right to interfere in tins hnseemly way, 
And if you try to domineer you'll find I 
won't obey. 
TI E— Some Wives do. 
SHE—And some wives don't. 
IIE—Some wives will. 
SHE—Tut this wife won't. 
It seems very hard— 
HE--I 
don't think it should. 
SHE— I'll go and tell my mother. 
Jiu—T only wish you would.

letter.] 
IIE—Take this letter to your mother, 
Tell her she's a 
plague to me. 
23 
SHE---just excuse ine, you're another, 
And you'd better let her be. 
If you get me in a 
pa- ' n, 
Then your conduct you will rue. 
HE—Since divorces are the fashion, 
Would you like to leave me,- too? 
Take this message to your mother, 
Tell her that I 
hope she'll be 
Off at once, somewhere or other 
Far across the deep blue sea. 
SHE— I say it is disgraceful the way you're going on ; 
You know my ma is not the kind to play your jokes 
Upon. 
At six o'clock, when she gets up to get your breakfast, 
sir, 
This is the way, you horrid brute, you stand and talk 
to her : 
" 
Now, Maria, blow the fire—puff, puff, puff." 
IIE—That's because I 
know she's such a 
muff, muff, muff. 
SHE— I 
thought you were a 
gentleman, but I 
find you ate a 
rough, 
And of this conduct I 
have had enough, ' nough, ' nough. 
IIE—Your tongue is most unruly ; you really must reflect. 
SHE—'Twas you commenced this row, my dear, be pleased to 
recollect. 
won't be called a 
rough, my love, 
I'd sooner run away. 
SHE—Oh, you can go just where you like, 
I 
shan't ask you to stay. 
IIE—Good-bye, Carrie, I 
must leave you. 
SHE—Oh, why did I 
marry and believe you • 
HE—Your sweet mamma can stay, and I 
will go away, 
So think of me when sitting down to tea. 
SI1E—Oh, I 
used to think in the days when we were young, 
When boy and girl we played, 
24 
That you'd be ever true, for dearly I 
loved you, 
You made Inc such a 
happy little maid. 
When mother had the kettle on to boil, 
And made you stay and take a 
cup of tea, 
You told me then how gladly you would toil 
If you could only pass your days with me. 
I 
love to think of the days when we were young, 
When around your neck I 
clung. 
HE—Yes, we were happy then. 
SHE—We may be so again ; 
Oh ! Harry, think of the days when we were young. 
HE—Well, well, I'm cooler now, but your mamma's a 
bore 
You know we had a dreadful row about her once be. 
fore. 
SHE—Well, Harry, if you let her stay another week or two, 
I'll tell her she must go away, or else agree with you. 
II E—All right, my dear, and never fear, 
If while she with us dwells, 
If she don't scold me, then we'll be 
As gay as wedding bells. 
ToGETHElt— 
The bells that rang merrily, ding, cling, dong, 
I 
low happy I 
was wen I 
heard their sweet song ! 
I 
fancied they said " You shall never get wrong, 
But both be happy at home." 
II E—\ nd now I 
am as happy as when we first were wed. 
SitE—And when you said you'd leave me you didn't mean 
what you said. 
IIE—When I 
am angry, darling, I 
don't know what I 
say. ; 
SHE—And I'm certain if you left me you couldn't stay away. 
TOGETIIER— 
And now we'll happy be, 
And go through life so merrily, 
Ao merrily, so merrily, 
We go through life so merrily.

Now there's Polly, my only daughter, 
Who's just turned twelve years of age, 
She's skipping and dancing the tra la lu,

For on every one's door they do knock ;

THE MINSTREL'S DREAM. 
An original song, as sung by FRANK LEWIS with innuense 
success. 
One eve while sitting in my chair before my Are so bright, 
Its rays dispelled the midnight gloom, and lightened up the 
night, 
My thoughts reverted to the past, and brought before my gaze, 
The shadowed forms of minstrels great, the kings of by-gone 
days; 
I 
saw the people laugh and cry, as alternately they gave— 
The merry pun, the mirthful joke, the ballad sweet and grave, 
They formed a 
quaint procession, as they passed before my 
sight, 
The minstrels of our former days, thus conjured from the night. 
I 
saw George Christy shake the bones, sweet music from them 
drag, 
And how the audience it would roar, as he told each merry gag, 
Saw " Detddy " Rice in ecstacy, those legs of his to throw 
The father of the minstrels—he who danced the first " Jim 
Crow ;" 
Heard Mulligan, with towering form, pathetic ballads sing, 
When Long John opened once his mouth, ' twas down the house 
he'd bring, 
Stevie Rogers gave his excelsior clog, the greatest ever seen, 
And other well-known faces came to fill rny minstrel's dream. 
Noise Seymour showed his giant form, and passed me by and 
A 
friend to every one in need, the minstrel's favorite child,

No doubt you will wcnder why I 
dress so gay, 
Always in fashion this swell of the day 
My clothes they are cut, in the latest of style, 
And the darling young ladies on me fondly smile. 
My way is so winning, full of exquisite grace, 
Why they really do laugh when we meet face to face. 
The gents they all look with derision at me, 
Because I 
am always dressed up to a 
T.

While pivoting, waltzing in the grand dance so gay, 
At sweet Saratoga or Far Rockaway. 
Oh I 
the darling young ladies say I 
am a 
dear, 
Why none's half so charming as Clarence Lavere. 
On a 
nice afternoon if the weather is fair, 
To my barber's I 
go to curl up my hair, 
Brushoff my clothes fix myself all serene, 
For I 
always endeavor to look bright and clean.

goad hand at billiards and like my good wine, 
A card player, well I'm considered quite tine. 
I 
never borrow trouble, always feel well, 
And a 
good joke I'm always quite ready to tell. 
While pivoting, etc. 
At a 
quarter of two I 
must be on Broadway, 
To meet a 
young lady I 
slw the other dAy 
Her pa he is rich—so at least I've been told— 
And all I 
desire is to grab at his gold. 
Then to the sea- beach in summer 
go, 
Cut such a 
dash, nh ! what a 
show. 
There ih the ball- room to promenade and dance, 
With any young lady I 
meet there by chance.

Written and sung by BEN DODGE. 
Oh! T 
love a 
charmer—a 
sweet little maid— 
With eyes like the stars in the sky, 
tier home is a 
cot in a 
green, mossy glade, 
Where a 
swift flowing brook ripples by; 
'Tis fair as an Eden with beautiful flowers, 
And there day by day at her side, 
Together we talk of the bright happy hours 
We'll pass when I 
claim her my bride. 
CHORUS 
Under the lilacs, under the lilacs, 
Talking of love on a 
bright summer's day. 
Under the lilacs, under the lilacs, 
Together we lovingly pass time away. 
One warm day in summer we sat 'neath the shade, 
Tier hand within mine I 
held fast, 
So earnestly talking to her, I'm afraid 
I 
knew not how quickly time passed; 
I 
begged her to join me through life's coming hours. 
She promised that she'd be my wife, 
How I 
bless the day, when ' neath the lilac's sweet flowers, 
I 
won, her, my darling, for life.

DANCE. 
Susie dances two strains of music. [ At the end of first 
strain, Tommy appears at door with Umbrella and a 
paper 
Satchel, and walks towards Susie, and in time with the 
music—hits her with umbrella—she falls—but when she 
sees her dear Tommy, she is all smiles again, then Tommy 
sings]— 
Oh Susie, here I 
is at last. 
You know I 
said I 
would. 
But I'd it got here sooner, Sue----
Dat's if I

Yes, something was the matter, 
And I

I 
had to work so very hard, 
All this blessed day. 
Chorus as before. 
And first, Tommy dances—then Susie dances, and both 
dance together; and at the end of third dance, Susie (by 
mistake, of course), kicks her foot clean through the 
satchel in Tommy's hand. 
At this juncture music stops, 
Susie and Tommy hold the picture, and Mr. Dunlap ap-
pears and stands above them.] 
Mr. D.—Susie what does this mean, 
/ausk you ?" 
SusrE.—This is my brother Tom—and you said you

Mr. D.—Ah ! Very well, Susie, leave the room.

Mr. D.—No, sir ; you're just the lively sort of servant I 
want, and you can enter upon your duties at once. 
In the 
first place, let me inform you that my wife is afflicted with 
temporary insanity ; that is, in short, she is crazy ; and 
the only thing to cure her is a 
servant, lively, like your-
self. 
You must humor her in all her changing moods and 
caprices ; sing, dance, or act, as she desires. 
She may 
knock you down with a 
chair or anything else ; but you 
mus'nt pay any, attention to that. 
he may kiss you in a 
loving way, and you must pay no attention to that, or 
anything. but humor her in everything, as we all do ; and 
lay this flattering unction to your soul, that in case she 
kills you, you shall have the finest fun, nil that any of 
your kind, ever had. 
And now, I 
will pay you five dollars 
a 
day until she is better ; then if-you-are-alive, I 
will give 
you one thousand dollars as a 
present ; and you shall live 
right hero in the parlor. eat, drink and smoke, at your 
leisure. 
And now, sir, I 
shall send your sister up with 
your breakfast. [Exit Mr. D.] 
TommT.—I golly, dis' what I 
have been looking for so 
long—five dollars a 
day live. eat, drink and smoke, right 
here in de parlor, and 1:.! I 
got to do is to humor her, let

The Day When You'll Forget Me. 
Words by " MonoAN." 
Music by J. R. Tuomes. 
As sung by JENNIE M ORGAN. 
hrte3iC to be had of OLIVER DITSON & CO., Boston, Mass., Pries 4004. 
You call me sweet and tender names, 
And softly•smooth my tresses, 
And all the while my happy heart 
Beats time to your caresses. 
You love me in your tender way, 
I 
answer as you let me ; 
But ah! there comes another day, 
The day when you'll forget me, 
The day when you'll forget me. 
I 
know that ev'ry fleeting hour 
Is marked by thoughts I 
bring you, 
I 
know there dwells a 
subtle pow'r 
In the sweet songs I 
sing you. 
I 
do not fear the darkest way, 
With those dear arms about me, 
Ah ! no, I 
only dread the day 
When you can live without me, 
When you can live without me. 
And still you call me tender names, 
And softly smooth my tresaies; 
And still my happy answ'ring heart 
Beats time to your caresses. 
Hush! let me put that touch away, 
And clasp your hands above me; 
So while I 
ask to die that day, 
The day you will not love me. 
The day you will not love me. 
You need not check the thoughts that rise 
With darkness wrapt about them, 
For gazing in your earnest eyes, 
My heart can almost doubt them. 
Yet hush my whispers as you may, 
Such chidings do not fret me; 
! 
no, I 
only fear that day, 
The day when you'll forget me, 
The day when 
you'll forget me,

We're light upon the floor as any feather.

GOOD-EVENING friends, I 
hope you're well, 
To you a 
story I 
will tell, 
flow head and ears in love I 
fell, 
With a 
dashing, gay brunette. 
The first time that I 
met her 
She was riding in a 
car, 
A 
gentleman was with her, 
I 
think it was her pa; 
I 
arose, and said, ' Will you accept my my Seat?" 
She smiled, and tit:inked me 
(Sirm.) With a 
smile so sweet, 
This dashing, gay brunette. 
We smiled and flirted as ()Awe rode, 
I 
followed her to her abode, 
Into her hand I 
slipped a 
note, 
Asking if I 
might on her call. 
Next day I 
got an answer, 
It filled me with delight, 
Stating I 
might call 
The coming Sunday night. 
I 
read and read her letter o'er again, 
i,Svm.) I 
thought myself the happiest of men, 
Oh my dashing, gay brunette. 
At the appointed time I 
rang the bell, 
'Twos answered by my little Nell, 
Her blushing face at once did tell, 
Watching she had been for me. 
No longer could I 
conceal it, 
So I 
told her of my love, 
And vowed I 
would be true to her 
As the stars above. 
She said that she could love none else but me, 
.9trm.) So next week I 
will married be 
To my dashing, gay brunetu.,_ 
THE DAY THAT WE WENT WEST 
Written by ED. HARRIGAN. 
Performed by HAnntoAx & HART. 
Whin we came out from Cork, 
This day twelve months ago; 
We landed in New York, 
At the Battery here 1)elow. 
We whit out on the railroad, 
On the freight that whit so slow; 
An' settled down a-farmin', 
In the State of Ohio, 
CHORUS. 
Oh, it's bothered we are really, 
We never have no rest, 
Since we met with Horace Greeley, 
And the day that we whit West. 
The divil a 
bite we ate 
Till we got to Chicago; 
Nor not a 
wink of slape, 
Oh, how could they trate us so? 
Then we rid upon the stages, 
All 'cross the prairie land ; 
And left the State of Ohio, 
For the State of Michigan. 
Oh, it's bothered, etc. 
We're tired out complate, 
Wid work and fat-i-gue; 
It's our frinds that we will seek, 
D'yees know thim, now, any of you ? 
Sure we would like to find thim, 
If yees would interest 
Yerselves just for a 
moment, sure, 
We're strangers from the West. 
it's bothered, etc. 
Theye's a 
happy little cot down in soathern Tennessee, 
Where the ivy blossoms twine round the door, 
And forever fresh and greoo in my memory it will be, 
Though I 
know, I 
never see it any more; 
But I 
never can forget tire old home I 
love so well, 
And the many good old tunes that I 
have sung, 
And the tears they fill my eyes every time I 
try to te:, 
Of the times I 
used to have whon I 
was young. 
CHORUS. 
Now the tambo and the bones, em breve,' laid a 
ray, 
The fiddle and the banjo am unstrung ; 
But I 
often havo a 
sigh for the happy days gone by, 
And the times I 
used to have when I 
was young, 
When the autumn days had come I 
would husk the yello•Ar corn, 
In the fields I 
was singing all the day, 
And before they made me free I 
had never cause to mourn; 
And around the old place everything was gay: 
And many and many a 
time when the work of day was, over, 
With my melody the old plantation rung. 
And my heart does often long for the happy days of yore, 
And the times I 
used to have when I 
was young.

Good evening to you, one and all,

For she said she loved no one but me, 
And I

My pet, in the dollar store ! 
Next Sunday is the happy day, 
She says we're to be wed.

'TwAs in the summer time, when the sun was low, 
Sinking in the west with a 
golden glow ; 
Long, long ago where I 
met my Joe, 
Down in the meadows where the violets grow. 
We wandered together in the dim twilight, 
Lovingly together in the summer night; 
Nor thought we then of time's quick flight, 
Down in the meadows where the violets grow. 
CHORUS. 
Down in the meadows where the violets grow, 
Down in the meadows where the violets grow; 
Long, long ago where I 
met my Joe, 
Down in the meadows where the violets grow. 
'Twas sad when the parting time was nigh, 
When we whispered many a 
fond good- by, 
And a 
little tear trembled in a 
bright sky, 
Down in the meadows where the violets grow. 
And many a 
time we've been since then 
To meet my darling love again; 
And ne'er was I 
so happy in my life as when

On the meadow, the vale and the stream, 
And the nightingale softly is calling,

Sung by J. 
W. 
GRIFFEN, with fourteen encores. 
The white apple blossoms are falling in showers, 
The rose bushes bloom in the sweet summer air; 
Enjoying the cal n 
of the bright sunny hours, 
Grandinothsr sits in her old easy-chair. 
She reads in her Bible of cities fair, 
Whose walls are of jasper and gold, 
And waits for the angels to carry her there— 
Don't leave poor Grandmother, now she is old 
CHORUS. 
Don't leave poor grandmother, now she's old, 
White silver locks now have displaced the gold. 
Don't leave poor gTandmother, now she's old, 
White silvered locks have now displaced the gold. 
! 
well we remember when poor mother died, 
They laid her to rest where the green willows wave, 
how ,grandmother comforted us when we cried, 
Tenderly led us away from the grave. 
How patient, and gentle, and kind she's been, 
Her love for us ne'er can be told ; 
Oh, may her life's evening be calm and serene, 
Don't leave poor grandmother, now she is old. 
Don't leave, etc. 
The old village school-house that stands on the hill, 
The quiet village churchyard where tall grasses grow; 
The swift running stream near the old water mill, 
Bring back the men Cries of long, long ago. 
These may he forgotten, but grandmother's care, 
Her tenderness, richer than gold, 
Shall ne'er be forgotten, our home she shall share, 
We'll not leave grandmother, now she is old. 
Don't leave, etc.

ITow oft when we hear of misfortune, 
Befalling a 
friend or a 
foe, 
If in joy or regrets we express it, 
That's the way of the world you all know; 
I 
thought I 
would speak of a 
subject, 
Interesting each village and town, 
That is iron-heeled capital striving 
To put the poor workingman down. 
CHORUS. 
Let capital shake hands with labor, 
Let the poor have the bread that they earn, 
For surely they need every penny, 
Is a 
lesson quite easy to learn; 
Remember the poor love their children, 
So give them a 
smile, not a 
frown, 
Live, and let live, be your motto, 
Oh! don't put the poor workingman down. 
That money is the root of all evil, 
Why all of us likely's found out, 
The richer class think that the poorer, 
Should of pleasure know nothing about; 
The honest poor always will labor, 
They don't ask a 
title or crown, 
Why begrudge them sufficient to live on, 
Don't put the poor workingman down. 
Let capital, etc. 
So now in conclusion I'll mention, 
That life being dear to us all, 
The poorer class must have existence, 
So — 
don't push them close to the wall 
Now hope that in future, the richer 
On the poorer will smile and not frown, 
Who ask but enough just to live on, 
Don't put the poor workingman down. 
Let capital, etc 
Words and music by J. F. 
SHERIDAN. 
DoN'T leave me angry, my darling, 
Don't leave me sadly like this; 
Come back and give me one kind word, 
Give me a 
good- night kiss. 
Sorry indeed am I, darling, 
For harsh, angry words that "I 
spoke ; 
The longue is to blame for them darling. 
The heart now would pardon invoke. 
Cuours. 
Don't leave me angry, darling,, 
Don't leave me sadly like this ; 
Come back and give me a 
kind word, 
Give me a 
sweet good-
night kiss. 
Don't leave me angry, my darling, 
This may be our last farewell ! 
Grim- visaged death, so uncertain, 
Silently sounds his sad knell I 
Fate, cruel fate, may decree, love, 
We from each other must part! 
Don't go away angry, my darling, 
Clasp me once more to your heart. 
Don't leave me angry, etc.

CARRIE, 
I'VE just returned from the Opera, 
Where music and beauty are found, 
Fair girls are arrayed in such splendor, 
And the elite of the West-end abound. 
Just grant me your polite attention, 
I'll relate of a 
charmer so fair, 
She's a 
gem of the very first water, 
Is my Carrie with the golden hair.

CHORUS. 
The ballet was really entrancing, 
The beautiful girls were all there, 
My Carrie was belle of the dancing, 
The girl with the golden hair. 
To dilate upon this beautiful creature, 
Is a 
task not so easily done— 
She's a 
Venus in every feature, 
And her dancing is really A

,he can hop, skip, and do the little caper 
On her toes, and leap into the air— 
The other ballet girls can only ape her, 
Yes, my Carrie with the golden hair.

The ballet was really entrancing, etc. 
In bouquets I 
spend all my " ready," 
To throw at my daring's little feet ; 
She's invited to a " tea- fight " already, 
And a 
muffin strue.gle at c, school treat: 
I'm sure to be cut off with a 
shilling, 
By the gov'nor who's as cross as any bear; 
But to live on cold mutton I'm willing, 
In a 
cottage with my Carrie so fair. 
SPOKEN—Yes, there's the old adage " love in a 
cot( ap,•e," 
and tho' the gov'nor does not smile upon our 
union,

We'd not set sail six weeks or more, 
When lor, the winds began to blow; 
For Mary Anne my heart felt sore,

American Forttine-Teiling Ci;rds.—This is the old.. 
est and most widely known pack of Fortune-Telling Cards. We have 
published it for years, and the demand is continually increasing. 
These Cards are arranged and printed in series— Hearts, Clubs. Dia-
monds and Spades—and each of these into K for King, Q for Queep, 
toad K 
for Knave, and numbers 1, 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
four rows, and are to be read according to directions. 
Many of the an. 
swers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under-
standing. 
Many professional Fortune-Tellers use these cards, and we 
are in receipt of letters in relation to them from all parts of the U. S.

Courting Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such si. way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by 
atlemen who are either too diffi-
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. 
The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unladylike encourage-
, 
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
-.' tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. 
This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the gam e 
as th ei
r 
own, 
unless 
it 
accords 
with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes a 
further explanation un-
necessary. 
The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, - 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties

leading New York Papers say of it: 
The N. Y. Evening Hail writes 
" 
A Little Book has lately appeared in print at Mr. A. J. Fisnares, 98 Nas 
sau street, called the " Little Flirt." We 
cannot say that we recommend 
it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, as we think it would only 
encourage the bad habit of " flirting." 
Unfortunately, there is enough 
of it done without any further necessity of explaining "how, when and 
where to do it," and this little volume would advise and initiate the un-
corrupted in practicing what is commonly called "flirting." 
The N. Y. Evening Telegram writes: " We have lately seen a 
neat -tittle 
book, bound in Morocco leather, costing twenty-five cents, called the 
" 
Little Flirt," published by A. J. FISHER, No. 98 Nassau Street. 
It 
gives information of the modus operandi of flirting, and of the mean-
ing of every motion of the handkerchief, fan, glove and parasol. 
As 
there is nothing at all objectionable in the volume, and its contents 
might afford some innocent amusement to many, we do not hesitate to 
recommend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers."
