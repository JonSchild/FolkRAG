TO Tiff: 
:PUBLIC, 
It is a 
well known fact, that Messrs. JOHNSON AND BRUNO 
are the most versatile song and dance arsists at present in the 
profession. 
Their business and style are not only original, but 
there is a quiet fine.9se about every thing they do which at 
once commands the admiration and applause of their auditors. 
This is not merely the assertion of an individual, but the opin-
ion of thousands who have witnessed their 
performance. 
Their acts are unique, sparkling, and brimful of quiet wit and 
humor, without the slightest tinge of vulgarity. 
Their success 
in the principal cities of the United States is entirely without 
precedent, and in most instances, they have fairly taken the 
audience by storm. 
The linguistic powers of Mr. Bruno are 
truly wonderful, he speaking:and singing correctly in seven dif-
ferent languages, in whIch he is ably assisted by his partner. 
They are good singers, fine grotesque dancers, and were the 
first to introduce feats of contortion in song and dance. 
A 
visit to the theatre at which they are playing will fully substan-
tiate the above. 
Respectfully Yours, 
A. J. DICK. 
Dramatic Agent.

JUST FROM TENNESSEE, 
Original by JOHNSON AND Bnuso. 
White folks we are just from Tennessee, 
We left our homes to have some recreation; 
Greatly delighted we will be, 
If we can onli gain your approbation. 
We parted from the old folks with a 
sigh, 
And left them there a-crying on the station; 
But they'll miss us, 'deed they will, 
And the place will be so still, 
BecouSe the boys have left the old plantation. 
When moon-light streamed across the cabin floor, 
'Twos then the old man sat the banjo Tinging; 
The darkies used to gather round the dour, 
And mosso too would listen to our singing. 
But often now we sigh for our old hoi:e, 
For it is the happiest spot in all theination 
But we'll go there before we die, 
And now we are going to try 
To show the style down on the old plantation.

old times, d:e. 
Written for BARNET W ILLIAMS, BY MR. GUEST. 
Should the mind be over-burdened with sorrows or care, 
Should Fortune betray us, or Friendship turn cold, 
What can turn into laughter the groans of despair, 
Like the wit and and the jestures of Barney the bold; 
With his toe and his heel, and a 
twirl of his stick, 
He'll bate the blue devils at once to ould nick 
Oh Comedy laughs in each glance of his eye, 
And his brogue it is sweeter than mountains poteen 
To match him for humor, in vain ye may try, 
Whilst night follows morning, and noon comes between; 
And " Barney, bold Barney," cry thousands with joy, 
" 
Is the raal spalpane, is our own Irish boy!" 
Come watch him, ye actors, come one and come all! 
How dull is your wit, and heavy your heels, 
Your efforts are great, but your acting is small, 
And Barney's the boy, all your humbug reveals! 
In the wide world he has not equal in that, 
For Paddy is Barney, and Barney is Pat! 
Original by JOHNSON AND BRUNO. 
If you will listen to us, we will sing you a 
verse, 
And when we feel better, we never feel worse; 
Some people do say, we were born too young, 
And if we are shot, we-will never be hung. 
There was a 
young man, from Leavenworth town, 
And when he was standing lie never sat down; 
He had a 
voice like a 
saw mill, and a 
head like a 
calf, 
And when he was crying, he never would laugh. 
There was a 
young woman from Kalamazoo, 
Her eyes they were blonde, and her hair it was blue; 
If she had not been white, she would have been black, 
And the hump of starvation was stuck on her back. 
We never stand still when we are walking around, 
And when we are up in the air, we are not on the ground; 
And when we feel better, we never feel sick, 
And if you paste together, we never will stick.

As sung by JOHNSON AND BRUNO. 
Oh my soul, my soul, l'rn a

In the arms of the angel Gabriel; 
And I 
climb on de hill, and I 
looked to de \Vest, 
And I 
cross over Jordan to de Lamb; 
And I 
sit me down in de old arm chair, 
Oh brethren, I'll never tire ; 
Oh Satan may sneeze, but I'll take my ease, 
And I'll warm myself at the holy lire. 
CHORUS. 
For we'll dance, (

And we'll shout, (

And we'll rise up so early in de morn; 
Den we will rise, and rub our sleepy eyes, 
When a 
Gabriel am blowing his horn. 
Oh we shan't weep long, when we're going to leave 
So we'll pack up our band box, and we'll go; 
Oh me brudder I'm a 
thinking, and dont you ever grieve , 
For we's gwine up to glory very slow; 
And we'll eat our meals three times a 
day, 
And you'll bet your life we won't be late; 
Oh we'll have lots a 
fun, when you and my brudder come, 
For we's gwlne to take de tickets at de gate. 
For we'll dance, &c.

THE PAR EX, NIGS, 
Dedicated to JOHNSON AND BRUNO BY JAMES F. 
DOOLEY. 
Behold before you here to- night, two double-breasted mokes; 
We guarantee to cure the blues, and we'll prove that we're 
no hoax; 
Well do our best to please you, if we dislocate our necks; 
Observe us get our work in, then you'll gamble we're 
Par Ex. 
CHORUS. 
If we watch the capering of these gents, (
Break) 
We know you'll say that we're immense; (
Break) 
Just watch us while we sift around, and dance two or three 
steps; 
And when we're through, we know that you, will gamble 
we're Par Ex. 
When we worked upon the levee, way down at New Orleans; 
We had some very happy times, and seen some joyous scenes, 
We used to juggle cotton bales, upon the steamer's decks, 
And when the work was over, why, ' tis then we'd feel 
Par Ex. 
If you watch, &c. 
But perhaps we are intruding, upon you're precious time, 
11 so don't be offended, nor consider it a 
crime; 
For we always labor hard to please, and do not wish to vex, 
So we leave it to your judgment, if these coons are not 
Par Ex. 
If you watch, Ice.

CONEY ISLE. 
Written by ED. HARRIliA.N. 
Originally sung by 13n...ur CAirrnn. 
At le German Saratoga, 
Way down at Coney Isle, 
I 
thought I'd go in swimming, 
Just for to see the style 
Of the different kinds of Mermaids, 
And near them yell and screech. 
While flopping in the water, 
At Coney Island beach. 
There was ladies and babies, 
As happy as could be, 
Dutch tailors and Dutch brewers, 
A swimming in the sea. 
Dry goods clerks in bathing, 
Looking like a 
barber's pole; 
All de Dutch from Mackerelville, 
Like porpoise they did roll; 
The shop girls look like maids, 
Floating from the shore, 
Yoang man newly married, 
Trying to drown his mother-in-law. 
There was drummers and bummers, 
As dirty as could be, 
Taking in their maiden wash, 
A 
swimming in the ea 
All the biggest p11.
, 
The fattest and the lean, 
All the water in the ocean 
Conld'nt wash them clean. 
Barnnin's big fat woman 
Swam our to a 
boat, 
All the buoys in the water 
Woukilt make her float. 
There were llannahs and Johaunahs, 
31aria's and Marie, 
Treading clams, the little lambs, 
While swimming in the sea. 
There was a 
lot of preachers, 
Who came Loin Brooklyn town, 
Went in to wash their sins away, 
But wickedness wont go down; 
It floated like the garbage, 
And kept within their reach, 
There's a 
good deal from Brooklyn, 
Hangs heavy on the beach_ 
There were ladies and babies, 
As happy as can be, 
Eat chowder at Mike Norton's, 
After swimming in the sea_

And again from East to West. 
We've sipped champagne in bright and naughty France, 
We have " plowed the raging main,"

But there's nothing can compare 
With the pure and balmy air

For to us it is most dear, 
And just while we're standing here,

With our easy, graceful style —

THE ACTOR'S GREAT BALL. 
An Original Song by FRANK LEWIS. 
As sung by him 
with Great Success. 
A 
comical story I'm going to tell you, 
I 
wrote it to please both tile great and. the small; 
It's about some good fun I 
had in this City, 
One night at the Actor's Professional Ball. 
The first set of Quadrilles was danced b." Tony Pastor, 
Of which Clara Morris the figures did call. 
Mr. Daly and Pique waltzed round faster and faster— 
Ther was fun, you can bet at the Actor's .-treat Ball! 
Josh Hart brought his Eagle to fly at the party, 
John Brougham a 
kiss from Miss Neilson he toot! 
Lester Wallack, he shaved off his whiskers, and gave them 
Unto the two Orphans of Sheridan Shook. 
Mr. Levy, he played on his Cornet, a 
Solo, 
As he sat in the Crucible of Oakey Hall! 
Pat Rooney and Harry Bennett, to enliven the meeting, 
Danced the Tra-la-loo, at the Actor's Great Ball. 
Jennie Engle appeared with her figs used in singing, 
And Sol Smith. Russell commenced for to blow. 
Harry Hill's Female Boxers wentin to fling him. 
To the place underneath, where all Actors do go. 
Then Rclly and Leon went in rough and tumble, 
Tore Leon's new dress, which cost thousands, he'll say. 
Gus Williams got his steam up and bursted his boiler, 
Aud John Hart, the skeleton, he fainted away. 
Billy Pastor then tried to waltz with Miss Markham, 
But his body was lar: e 
and his legs they were small 
So he got the two Brahams to drop all their H's, 
They tripped up Jennie Hughes, her sweet vocals and all. 
Anna Dickinson then danced, her crown of thorns wearing. 
Which gave to the critics an unmerciful shock. 
While Jarrett & Palmer made Tooker keep swearing— 
There was no boat afloat like the great Plymouth Rock! 
As daylight approached, the fun kept increasing; 
Mr. Theodore Moss called his Jockey a 
fool— 
Then Boucicault came in with a 
play he had stolen, 
And closed up the clas lights of friend John F. Poole. 
Just then occurred what you would call a 
commotion; 
I Kate Claxton had Fannie Davenport Pinned ' gainst the wall. 
Harrigan & Hart then appeared in their unequalled effusions, 
And that put an end to the Actors Great Ball!

THE LITTLE PLAIN GOLD RING.

By EDWARD HARRIC4AN. 
Copyrighted lS7Ei, by A. J. P1SHER, 95 Nassau St., New York. 
ARILUI, when I was a young man, 
At the age of twenty-three, 
I 
loved sweet Molly Doolats. 
And I 
knew that she loved Inc. 
We courted In the winter time, 
And one May morn in Spring, 
She gave to me this token, boys, 
This little plain gold ring. 
Fond remembrances bring, 
[Spit.] 
This little plain gold ring. 
I 
remember well our wedding day, 
When the neighbors one and all 
With hope and sunshine on their face, 
So pleasantly did call. 
Arrah how they laughed, 
And how they danced, 
The presents the,. did bring; 
Sure, there it lays beneath my gaze, 
In this little plain gold ring. 
Fond remembrances bring, [ Syrn.1 
This little plain gold ring. 
Ah, I 
see the dreary winter, 
I 
hear the trembling wind, 
Whisper to me soft and low, 
Your Molly true and hind, 
Must leave you now, Danneen asthote, 
My wife, my everything, 
I 
pictured there beyond compare, 
In this little plain gold ring. 
Fond remembrances bring, [Syna.1 
This letter plain gold Ong. 
In these now hard, uncertain times, 
They do things very queer; 
If you hav'nt got the ready cash, 
You cannot get your beer; 
The man behind the bar will say, 
Just by way of a 
joke— 
He'll shake hiz head with a 
meaning smile— 
You know the slate is broke.. 
CHORUS. 
You're welcome in, to spend your tin, 
To have a 
drink or smoke; 
But you'd better put the money up, 
For you know the slate is broke. 
When you're daily labor is ended, 
And to walk you feel inclined ; 
As you pass along the busy street, 
How many friends you'll find; 
They'll say to you, come and take a 
think— 
You'll return it with ai
;,atok-e ; 
But () It'd better put the money up, 
Fcl. you know the slate is broke. 
You're welccutie, ke, 
Perhaps you'll make a 
night of it, 
The fun will run so high; 
You'll get drinking by the bucket-full, 
And always getting dry; 
But when the sober morning comes, 
You'll feel like a 
hungry moke; 
To think you've spent your ready cash, 
And know the slate 13 troli-e. 
You're welcome, Sr.o. 
It's one word more I'll say to you, 
And then I 
will be done; 
I 
hope that I 
have pleased you all, 
And have offended none; 
But before I 
say good-bye to you, 
My advice I 
hope you'll take ; 
Don't let your slate hang up too high, 
Or it may fall and break. 
CHORUS. 
You're welcome in, to spend your tin. 
To have a 
drink or smoke; 
But you'd better put your money up, 
For you know the slate is broke.

Our Pretty Rosy Posy's gone and left us in despair,

While slowly walking up the beach, a 
maiden there we 
spied, 
With her a 
few words we did beseech, she answered with 
a 
sigh; 
Of all the treaSures we possess, we truly make a 
vow— 
If with her love she had us blessed, we'd freely give them 
f. sad misfortune we have had, in this our love affair; 
"'Mt HOW its o'er, we feel quite glad, our hearts can be 
repaired; 
But still at times we love that maid, who look'd so neat 
and cosy— 
With us her charms will never fade—Our Pretty Rosy Posy.

There's a 
lovely little maiden, 
Living down in yonder lane, 
Who has promised that she'd see me here to-night; 
And my heart with love is laden. 
Oh ! the sweet, delicious pain, 
That enraptured hearts experionce with delight I 
And oh! she is charming 
As the flowers in May ; 
Or as lovely as a 
peach in the fall ! 
And I 
could'nt see the harm in 
Giving her my love to-day. 
For I'really think she's sweetest of them all

She's my own—my heart's desire— 
Is my dark- eyed sweet Maria ! 
Oh ! tell me why you wink your eye, 
You roguish little butterfly ! 
As if you knew the reason I 
am here. 
And merrily from every tree, 
The pretty warblers sing to me ! 
Because they know Maria loves me, dear! 
MARIA. 
Now I 
wonder, where's Charley ? 
Surely, this is where he said 
That he'd meet me when the evening's shadows fell. 
May be I 
have come to early ; 
Or, perhaps he has delayed, 
Culling posies for me in the flowing dell. 
But I 
feel just as happy 
As a 
sweet Magnolia flower ! 
Or the Honeysuckle, hanging to the wall! 
When I 
saw his manly beauty, 
I 
was victim of its power ; 
So I 
cannot help but love him best of all!

He's my own—my heart's desire— 
And he calls me his dear Maria !

Why, my pretty little primrose, 
I 
have heard your pretty song, 
Low and sweet as zephyrs passing thro' the trees ; 
Then a 
feeling in my heart arose 
That I 
had kept you long. 
And now, I 
hope that you'll forgive me, won't you,

Never ask me, Charley, darling! 
Long as you may ever live;

Where the rich and poor they both enjoy 
The same bright tight of day ;

For nobles without pay, 
But go and gain your liberty

For sweet kmerica.

The place of all the world the best. 
Oh, where are the children that once used to play 
In the lane by the old cabin door, 
They are scattered now and o'er the world they roam 
The old man ne'er will see them more. 
No, the old home, &R. 
Vow the old man would rather lived aml died 
In the home where his children were born, 
But when freedom came to the coloreo mar., 
He left the cotton- field and corn. 
This old man has lived out his three score at,...1 ten, 
And he'll soon have to . ay down and die, 
Yet he hopes to go unto a 
better land, 
how old abin home. good-bye.

WHERE THE WATER LILIES GROW: 
Music by ARTHUR PERCY. 
Published by Wm. A. POND & CO., 547 Broadway, New York.. 
'TWAS in the pleasant summer time, I 
met him all by 
chance, 
The robins sang their sweetest rhyme, and loving was his 
glance; 
We wander'd 'mid the blooming flow'rs, he called me sweet 
and fair, 
The queen of all the sunny bow'rs, the brightest rose-bud 
there. 
SPOILEN,—Oh, he was charming—such a delightful little 
fellow! 
I 
never can forget— 
• CHORUS. 
When we met there by the river, 
In the sun-light's merry glow; 
For my heart he won forever, 
Where the pretty little water-lilies grow. 
I 
dream of him where'er I 
go, I 
never can forget 
Those eyes that shone with sparkling glow, the day whkle 
first we met; 
The lilies all will fade and die. the birds will fly away, 
We can't forget, nor he nor I, the love was told that day.

I 
KNOW SHE LOVES ME. 
SONG AND DANCE. 
Sung by T. M. HENGLER. 
I 
know a 
little maiden, fair and young, 
The sweetest little creature in the village, 
Her face is like a 
garden of flowers, new sprung, 
And she lives within a 
rustic little cottage. 
There may be maidens just as fair, 
With the same bright winning ways 
But none with eyes so lovely, 
Such a 
sweet bewitching gaze. 
Oh, yes, she is a 
beauty, so loving kind and true, 
And the only girl to suit me, 
With her laughing eyes of blue. 
That's why I'm always happy, light and gay, 
Because, you see, my heart with love is laden ; 
Cupid came and drove dull care away, 
The day I 
met this pretty little maiden. 
I 
know she loves me dearly, (symph.) 
Her actions prove it clearly. ( " ) 
CHORUS. 
That's why Fin always happy, light and gay, 
Because, you see, my heart with love is laden : 
Cupid came and drove dull care away. 
The day I 
met this pretty little maiden. 
One day, while we were walking side by side, 
I 
never shall forget the look she gave me; 
'Twas when I 
asked her would she be my bride ? 
She smiling said, of course. if you will haire me, 
Then threw her arms around my neck— 
Which I 
took not amiss, and in that happy moment, 
You might have heard a 
kiss. 
Oh yes, she loves me dearly, and I 
love her the same 
While her actions prove it clearly 
That she'd like to change her name. 
So there will be a 
wedding some fine day, 
And you will hear the merry bells a 
ringing ; 
We'll live out in the country in grand array, 
In a 
flow of joy we'll dwell—to birds a 
singing. 
I 
know she loves me dearly, (symph) 
Her actions prove it clearly, ( " ) 
That's why I'm always happy, 
I've Only Been Down to the Club.

Last night I 
was out rather late— 
*Twas only an innocent spree--
Hy wife for my coming did wait, 
When sleeping I 
thought she would be; 
I 
found her in temper and tears ; 
Oh she cried, it's a 
sin and a 
shame— 
And she scratched both my eyes and my ears', 
But I 
told her I 
soon would explain.

meeting, to night, love, 
Of bus'ness we had a

My boots I 
left down in the hall, 
And softly I 
crept up the stairs; 
Y, kept rather close to the wall, 
And thought to ascend unawares; 
But just as I 
got to the door, 
I 
seemed to get lost in the dark;

And just then I 
could only remark—

BANJO SOLO. 
As sting by ANDY Connom, at ToNy PASTOR'S, Bay, 
N. Y. 
There was a 
young man who never had his health, 
He was subject to all kinds of ills ; 
He went down in town on Sunday afternoon, 
And bought a 
box of Vegetable Pills. 
He took twenty-six, and then he went to bed, 
And soon he was fast asleep • 
And to his surprise when he open'd up his eyes. 
He was turned to a 
big dead-beat. 
SPOKEN.—That's the reason. Ladies and Gentlemen, you 
should never partake of those luxuries commonly called 
Vegetable Pills— 
CnennTs. 
For if you do, surely you'l rue it, 
Though strange to you it seems. 
For how funny you. would look, all strung upon a 
hook, 
And all turned into beans. 
The old woman was taken with a 
pain in her head, 
And she sent for her darling Lou ; 
She says, go bring me that same box of pills, 
And I 
think I 
shall try some too. 
But the pills made her worse, when she sent for the nurse ; 
After taking in a 
great big number, 
When she look'd in the glass she was.just as green as gra.ss, 
She had turned to a 
big cucumber ! 
For if you do, (Ve. 
-Now the old pussie cat was looking for a 
rat, 
When she spied that box of pills ; 
She was looking all around when she gobbl'd them down, 
She thought they would cure all her ills ; 
But then the fun begun when the cat began to run 
From the cellar clear up to the garret; 
And her body it turned to a 
barrel of sour kraut, 
And her tail it turned into a 
carrot!

said before, Ladies and Gentlemen—

It's then to the neighbors we would run,

ORIGINAL RIVAL SONG AND DANCE. 
BY 
COTTON & BIRDW• 
First .Man.—Where grows the spicy Cocoa tree, 
And blooms the flowers over ; 
I 
met my little Nancy first, 
Beside a 
rolling river ; 
She swore to love me always, true, 
While strolling by the stream ; 
And life' seem'd brighter far to me, 
A 
sweet and sunny dream ! 
CHORUS. 
Where the billows roar, on the sandy shore, 
I 
wait, and almost fancy . 
I 
hear the footsteps, soft and light, 
Of pretty little Nancy ! 
Sec'd 
met my true love at a 
ball— 
She smiled on me so sweetly— 
She was the fairest of them all, 
My heart was won completely ; 
She told me Nancy was her name, 
And that she'd be my bride! 
And we through life should, hand in hand, 
Go drifting with the tide ! 
Where the billows roar, & c. 
1st. —Why, Brother John, how do you do ? 
2d.—My Gracious! Brother Peter, 
As we both seem to love one girl, 
One of us will have to shake her ! 
lst.—I'll tell you now, let them all go— 
Let Nancy wed another. 
2d.—Well, here's my hand

heard sweet music floating in the air, 
So sweet, so nice, enchanting does it seem, 
I

Oh, music! oh, singing! dancing is my style! 
For I

I 
thought it was near morning, while sleeping there last 
night. 
I 
thought I 
heard sweet music, while stars were shining 
bright; 
So sweet, so nice, enchanting does it seem, 
I 
feel as though I 
was dancing in a

Oh, music (Vc. 
We are two Fee G. Canibles, and love to dance and sing ; 
No sorrow ever troubles us, we're happy as a

As sung by Joinisoif t 
Butrzio. 
We're what you call two solid, gay young men. 
If you doubt us we will prove it, for we can; 
For to.sing and dance at night 
Gives us joy and great delight— 
In this country, our likes you ne'er can find. 
Cnosue. 
For we turn right around, 
Plant our feet upon the ground; 
And all the pretty girls are bound to bow you know, 
As down the street we go, 
From each tongue you'll hear it flow, 
There goes them two, solid gay young men. 
Oh we were at a 
ball the other night, 
And all the darkies they begin to fight; 
But then we never run, for we're always in for fun, 
And to sing and dance you find is our delight. 
For we turt: right around. Ika.

WE came from de city ob Charleston in de State oh South Car-
line, 
And we hab just dropped in to make a 
call. 
We've been a 
long time coming, but I 
guess we are in time, 
When we started it was early in de FalL 
We're not such very fancy darkies, 
Although we always keep a-looking clean, 
And we hope when you go home to-night your verdict it will be, 
That you are satisfied with what you've seen. 
We used to pick de oranges and sell dem in de streets, 
And seldom dat we made enough to lib; 
So den we went to blacking boots upon de gemmen's feet, 
But we got too big and had to quit de biz. 
Now we ain't got time to tell you all our history, 
For which, we hope, you will not think us mean, 
For where we go we always like to bear the people say 
Of us, they're satisfied with what they've seen.

I'D DO IT, OR KNOW THE REASON WHY, 
Air.—" 
Mmtle77f,11 Ilmn We Do It." 
Now I 
hope I 
don't intrude, and you mustn't think me rude. 
If a 
question I 
should ofTer to suggest; 
Some philos:pers do say " every dog will have his day," 
And they tell us everything is for the best. 
But as I 
look around, so many things I've found 
Which seem to me quite .wrong and all awry; 
I've noted down a 
few, which I'll 11GW recount to you, 
I'd correct them—or I'd know the reason why. 
The papers all do state that at Washington, of late, 
Dishonesty in office has been found; 
There's crooked Whiskey Rings, and a 
heap of other things, 
Where bribery and thievery abound. 
If I 
was only President, I'd- settle that machine. 
To rob our Uncle, Sam they shouldn't try; 
For every office-holder should show a 
record clean, 
And they'd do it—or I'd know the reason why. 
In time not long gone by, we the world could defy, 
On the ocean, just as well as on the land, 
But no navy now we've got, and our vessels go to rot, 
Yes, our National shipbuilding's at a 
stand. 
If I 
but had my say, I 
would start at them straightway, 
Our mechanics, who for work do daily cry, 
And each for honest labor should have his honest pay, 
Well, l'd do it—or I'd know the reason why. 
There's Justice figured blind, the reason you will find— 
For the rich and poor a 
different law we've got; 
If a 
rich man runs away with his thousands, they will say— 
He's absconded simply—but a 
thief he's not I 
But let a 
poor man steal but the buying of a 
meal, 
He's arrested, and his case at once they'll try; 
Now if I 
was but the judge, even justice I 
would deal, 
Yes, I'd do it— or I'd know the reason why. 
Another Indian war we have got to settle for, 
With the hostile Sioux we've trouble got on hand ; 
each manly heart alarms, for the Redskins are in arms, 
They've slaughtered gallant Custer and his band. 
The only way, no doubt, the red devils to wipe out, 
And safety for our settlers there to buy, 
Is to send a 
thousand riflemen, and every on a 
Neout! 
And they'll do it—or they'll know the reason why.

MASSA'S KITCHEN FLOOR, 
As sung by JOHNSON tt Biro. 
Two old Virginia Niggers, 
You musn't think we're green; 
When working on the Steamboat 
On the Mississippi stream, 
We used to tote the cotton bales, 
And heave the plank ashore; 
And often spend our money 
On the Old Virginia shore. 
CHORUS. 
Two lightning, colored Mokes, [ Break 
From Old Virginia shore. 
[Break 
[Repeat 
And now we'll show you how we dance 
On old Massa's kitchen floor. 
When on the old platatioia, 
Us darkies,held our sway ; 
We'd sing and dance from morn to night, 
And on the Banjo play; 
We'd pick the cotton, hoe the corn, 
And when our work was o'er; 
Then all together we would dance 
On Massa's kitchen floor. 
Two lightning, 4ka.

EMMET'S •NO MORE. 
By Hama OSBORNE_ 
Sung with great success by FANNY 
W ENTWORTH. 
AIP.: Exile of Erio. 
Despair in her wild eye, a 
daughter of Erin 
Appeared on the clift of a 
bleak rocky shore, 
Loose in th wind flowed her dark streaming ringlets, 
As heedless she gazed on the dread surges' roar. 
Loud rang her harp in wild tones so despairing, 
The tune passed away with the present comparing, 
And in soul-thrilling strains deeper sorrow declaring, 
She sang Erin's wrongs, or my Emmet's no more. 
Oh Erin, my country, thy glory's departed, 
For tyrant's and traitors have stabbed thy heart's core. 
Thy daugbter's now leave in the streams cf affliction, 
Thy patriots are fled or lie stretched in their gore. 
Ruthless ruffians now prowl in thy hamlets forsaken, 
And from pale hungry orphans their morsel have taken, 
Yet the screams of thy females no pity awaken, 
Alas, my poor country, thy Emmet's no more. 
Brave was his -spirit, yet mild as the brahmin. 
His heart bled in anguish at the wrongs of the poor, 
To relieve their haJd sufferings he braved every danger, 
The vengeance of tyrants undauntedly bore. 
Even before him the proud titled villains in power 
Were seen, though in ermine, in terror to cower, 
But alas he is gone, he has fallen a 
young flower, 
They have murdered my Emmet, my Emmet's no roeve

Our efforts all are meant— [ Bain 
We never take back pay, you know, 
It is beneath our gaze! 
We only take our salary— 
It's funny how it pays ! 
CHORUS. 
We are two colored Congressmen, 
And honesty we teach; 
We're never known to take a 
cent— 
When it's out of our reach ! 
To serve the public interests, 
It is our only aim ; 
And if the Treasury is rol- : 1, 
Why we are not to blame. 
Oh ! when we were elected, 
It was by the people's voice ; 
They knew that we were honest, 
And we were their willing choice ; 
And soon we will be Ministers, 
To England or to France ; 
And with the beauties of the Court, 
Oh! we will have a 
dance ! 
We are two colored, 4it.

A

it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, as we think it would only 
encourage the bad habit of " flirting." 
Unfortunately, there is enough 
of it done without any further necessity of explaining " how. when and 
where to do it," and this little volume would advise and initiate the un-
corrupted in practicing what is commonly called "flirting.'• 
The N. f. Eeening Telegram writes: " We have lately seen a 
neat litt!s 
book, bound in Morocco leather, costing twenty-five cents, called the 
"Little Flirt," published by A. J. Fisush, No. eti Nassau street. 
It 
gives information of the modus operandi of flirting, and of the meaning

American Fortune-Telling Cards.—This is the old-
est and most widely known pack of Fortune-Telling Cards. We ha-78 
published it for years, and the demand is continually increasing. 
These Cards are arringed and printed in series—Hearts, Clubs, Dia-
monds and Spades—and each or these into K for King. Q for Queen, 
and K for Knave, and numbers 1, 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
four rows, and are to be read according to directions. 
Many of the an-
swers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under-
standing. 
Many professional Fortune- Tellers use these cards, and we 
are in receipt of letters in relation to them from all parts of the U. S.

Cour 
t 
lig; Ca rds.— This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too diffi. 
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unlady-like encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many 
lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers. will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties
