FESTIVAL OF  AMERICAN  FOLKLIFE
 
TO OPEN  JUNE  25  ON  MALL
 
The  n i
n t h
 annual  Festival  of  American  Folki i
fe will  be  held
 
on  the  50-acre Mall  between  the  L
incoln  Memorial  and  the  Washington
 
Monument June  25  -

 6,  1975.
 
The  celebration of  traditional  American  folk culture  is
 
sponsored  by  the  Smithsonian  I
nstitution  and  the National  Park
 
Service.
 
James  R.  Morris,  Director of  the  Smithsonian's  D
ivision
 
of  Performing Arts,  which  produces  the event,  says  1975 will  be  a
 
time  to  refine  and  hone the  Festival  i
n  preparation  for the  summer-
long  Bicentennial  super  Festival  in  1
976.
 
The  Festival  is  a coming  together of  folk cultures,  a
 
kaleidoscope of  exhibits  and  demonstrations  tracing  roots  and
 
present  day  forms of  the  nation's  folk cultures.
 It  is  a free,
 
educational  and  non-commercial  event,  a family affair to p
lease
 
young  and  old.
 As  Festival  Director  Ralph  Rinzler points out,
 
it would  take a l
arge  investment of  time and  travel  across  the
 
l
and  to  locate,  see and  hear the  representative  sampling of
 
Americana  brought together  for this  annual  celebration  of  the
 
nation's  b
irthday.

"Old  Ways  i

brought with  them to the  New World,  including  crafts,  music,  dance
 
and  food  ways.
 This  year,  in  European  and  Asian  Ways,  participants
 
have  been  invited  from Japan,  Lebanon,  Germany  and  Italy  to join
 
with  their American  counterparts  i
n  traditional  celebrations,
 
weddings,  Saturday  n
ight  socials,  harvest  songs  and  dances.

Mexico.
 The  special  theme  evolving out of  Old  Ways  to  present
 
B
lack cultural  materials,  'The African  Diaspora,"  seeks to make
 
a comprehensive  statement  from the  B
lack American community  that
 
will  acknowledge the  African  presence  in  B

"Working  Americans",  the  third  main  Festival  theme,  has  been
 
a p
ioneer effort  in  folklore,  demonstrating  occupational  culture
 
and  folk expressions that  develop  among  working men  and  women.

ighlight Workers  in Transportation:
 
railroad  workers,  truck  drivers,  seafarers,  air  traffic
 
controllers  and  auto,  aircraft and  possibly  ship  assembly  workers.
 
A train  will  span  a portion  of  the Mall,  symbol  of  a major
 
recurring  folkloric  theme,  and  p
lans  call  for workshops  to  be
 
conducted  from  railroad  cars.
 
"Regional  America",  the  theme  that  began  with  presentations
 
from a featured  state,  will  this  year  for the  f

music,  cookery,  and  crafts  from two  regions:  Coastal  California
 
and  the  Northern  Plains  (North  and  South  Dakota,  Nebraska  and

Family  folklore  focuses on  four areas  common  to  a
ll  family
 
l

h
istories,  stories  handed  down  from the  past.  The  Family  Folklore
 
f
lenfer will  have a presentational  area  for  each  of  the media  in

 I
n  1974
 
Festival  tours  p
layed  to audiences  ranging  from  300,000  in
 
Detroit's On  the  R
iverfront  Festival  to the entire  Scandinavian
 
population  of  Minot,  North  Dakota,  who turned  out  to  see
 
Scandinavian  participants.
 
I
n  the  area of  refining  Festival  techniques,  special
 
attention  is  being  given  the site  in  terms of  structures  that
 
can  withstand  a summer-long  Festival  in  1
976;  the Park  Service,
 
with  p
lanning  under the  direction of  Douglas  L
indsay,  Bicentennial
 
Coordinator,  is  working on  l
andscaping  with  increased  use of
 
f
lowers,  crops  and  high  grasses,  and  alternatives  to  parking
 
using  shuttle  bus  service  begun  in  1974.
 A further  refinement
 
of  presentational  techniques  is  the  i
nclusion  of  l
earning  centers
 
i
n  primary  program areas.
 
The  Festival  is  supported  by  the American  Revolution
 
B
