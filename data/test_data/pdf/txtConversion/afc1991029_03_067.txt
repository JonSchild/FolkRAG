26-27
 Brassieur  and  Ornstein  examine  the  demolished  barn
 
belonging to Ethel Gagnon in Eagle Lake,  ME.
 Old barns
 
are  often  torn  down  and  the  wood  salvaged;  often  the
 
large frame timbers are used to construct a new barn.
 In
 
frame #27,  Mrs.  Gagnon's house and tool shed are visible
 
in the background.
 
28-29
 Ethel Gagnon
 
30-31
 An outbuilding behind the house which Mrs.  Gagnon called
 
the  "tool shed;"  outbuildings are typical  in the study
 
area,  and this appears to be one of the oldest in Eagle
 
Lake.
 Design  features  of  the  outbuildings  often  echo
 
those used in house construction; note the Greek Revival
 
cornices on this shed.

 Bernette  Albert  gives  her  talk  on  the  history  of  the
 
first  Acadians  to  populate  the  St.  John  Valley  at  the
 
memorial marking the spot where the Acadians first landed
 
4-8
 Looking  south  from  the  memorial;  note  the  hedgerows
 
traversing the hillsides,  which may mark property  line
 
divisions  of  the  early  land grants.
 These grants were
 
done in the typically French "long lots" and measured in
 
arpents

Front view of the Albert house, which has been moved from
 
its  original  location  to  the  property  owned  by  the
 
Madawaska Historical Society in St.  David Village.
 The
 
house  is a typical  type built  in the  study area  in the
 
mid-18th  century;  the  balustrade  was  likely  a  later
 
addtition.

 One of the looms
 
17-18
 A hinge  on the door  of  an  armoire;  the  hand-made nails
 
indicate this piece was probably made  in the early 18th
 
century
 
19-20
 A woven mat which was purportedly found in the walls of
 
the  Albert  house;  it  appears  to  be  of  Native  American
 
origin
 
21-25
 A part  of the mat  and a birch bark container which was
 
also found in the walls of the house
 
26-27
 A "ship's knee"  in the attic of the Albert house;  these
 
pieces  were  cut  from  the  root  and  trunk  of  a hardwood
 
tree,
 maintaining
 the
 natural
 curve
 of
 the
 wood.
 
Originally a maritime construction method,  these pieces
 
were  apparently used  fairly  often  as  roof  supports  in
 
18th century houses in the study area.
 
28-29
 A section of the Albert house roof; note the ship's knee,
 
the  compound rafters,  and the  large timbers which form
 
the top plate,  all typical of houses in the study area
 
30
 Ship's knee; these were attached to the framing timbers

(the spelling varies) are a type of onion widely grown in
 
the study area;  typically,  the bulbs are packed in salt
 
water and the tops are chopped and combined with salt and
 
herbs  to  make  les  herbes  salées, 
which  is  used  in
 
flavoring soups and other dishes.

 Freeman shows Brassieur the house;  houses of this  size
 
and proportion, with simple gabled roofs,  are one of the
 
most common types found in the study area.  Many of them
 
are log houses; Freeman describes his as being "pit-sawn
 
madrier,"  indicating that it is wood construction which
 
may or may not be log.
 
32-36a
 Scenes inside Freeman's barn;  note the picture of Saint
 
Therese and the rameaux (
"blessed palm")  hanging on the
 
post.
 Such religious objects can be found in every type
 
of  structure  in  the  study  area;  their  function  is  to
 
protect the building and occupants from disasters such as
 
lightning and fire.

Historic Places.
 All of the historic buildings have been moved to
 
the site from elsewhere in the study area.
 
2-4
 Roy house,  piéce-sur-piéce log construction;  apparently
 
the  corner  joints  of  this  house  were  partially  sawn

reconstructed.
 Detail  of  the  joinery  is  probably  not
 
historically accurate.
 
7-9
 Maison  Morneault,
 a  typical  Acadian  house  of  mid-
nineteenth
 century
 construction;
 the

 The most popular
 
dance  was  a mixer  called  "Lady  of  the  Lake,"  which  was  danced
 
several  times  during  the  evening  to  a variety  of  reel/hornpipe
 
tunes.
 Some of the dances,  including the "Lady of the Lake," were

 There
 
were tables  set up on both  sides  of  the dance  floor,  and people
 
would sit at these tables and socialize between dances.

These images document a nineteenth century Acadian house called the
 
Vitale Violette house,  also known as Maison Heritage.
 This house,
 
listed  in  the  National  Register  of  Historic  Places,  originally
 
stood  in  Van  Buren.
 It  has  been  dimantled,  and  currently  is
 
stacked under a tarp behind the home of Don Cyr at the presbytery
 
of Our Lady of Mount Carmel Catholic Church in Lille,  ME.
 These
 
photographs  were  taken  by  Don  Cyr  as  the  house  was  being
 
dismantled.
 Mr.  Cyr was not a member of the field research team
 
for
 the  Maine  Acadian
 Project;
 therefore,
 the  photos  were
 
accessioned and logged by fieldworker David Whitman on August 30,
 
1991.
 These prints were made using Don Cyr's negatives by Steve
 
Young,  proprietor of Young's Photography,  RFD #1,  Box 726,  Queen
 
Village,  Madawaska,  ME
 04756; phone  (
207)  543-6116.

 Rear corner view of house in early stages of disassembly.
 
This house  is a typical mid-nineteenth century Acadian
 
house  is  size,  proportion,  and architectural  features.
 
Like many of these nineteenth century houses, it has been
 
enlarged, and converted from one-and-half to two stories.

Front corner view; the large front door and second story
 
double  window with  Greek  revival  features  were  almost

 The
 
dark  outline  indicates  that  there  was  a small  lateral
 
addition on the house.

Inside view of walls.  The construction of this house was
 
of a type often called piéce-sur-piéce en coulisse, in
 
which horizontal logs are stacked one on top of another,
 
and at least some of the joinery is done with tenons on
 
the logs sliding into grooves in a vertical log.  On this
 
house,  the  pieces are  joined  to  the  window  and  door
 
frames  in  this  en  coulisse fashion.
 In  some  Acadian
 
houses,  the corners are joined in this fashion; this is
 
not  the  case  in  this  house  (see  #6  below).
 Note  the
 
tenons on the top of the vertical window frame members;
 
mortise-and-tenon  construction  was  a commonly  used  by
 
Acadian builders.

 This view shows the corner joints of the piéce-sur-piéce 
f
i
 
construction.
 This  type  of  joinery  is  not  a well-
documented  type,
 and  we  have  not  discovered  a  name
 
already  in  the  literature  for  it.
 Presently,  we  are
 
describing it as a flush-sawn trunnel-joined corner.  
Front  view  later  in  the  dismantling;  evident  in  this
 
photo is the construction method known as planche debout,
 
in which vertical planks are attached to the log walls.

This log describes a series of aerial photographs taken by Julie
 
Bayly of Fort Kent,  ME.
 Ms.  Bayly was contracted by the American
 
Folklife Center to accompany fieldworker David Whitman on a flight
 
over the study area and take these photographs using her medium-
format  (
2 1/4 "
 square)  camera.
 There are a total of nine logs in
 
this series,  MAP-DW-B0061 through MAP-DW--B0069,  each describing a
 
set  of  contact  prints  made  from  Ms.  Bayly's  negatives.
 These
 
photographs were accessioned and logged by David Whitman.
 
4-6
 Farmland and forest near the Frenchville airport; much of
 
the forest land  in the study area  is re-forestation of
 
abandoned farmland.
 
7
 Fields near Lavertu Settlement
 
8-12
 Lavertu Settlement, a small agricultural settlement near
 
Long Lake;  the long-lot rectangular shape of the fields
 
and  the
 line-settlement  pattern  are  typical  French
 
patterns.

 Madawaska, ME (top,  #2-4; right,  #5), and Edmunston, New
 
Brunswick,  the two largest towns in the study area,  face
 
each other across the St. John River.
 Each has a Fraser
 
Paper Co. mill.
 Note that there are two bridges between
 
the towns;  one is  for vehicular traffic  (right,  #2-3),
 
and  one  carries  materials  back  and  forth  between  the
 
paper mills.
 
6-7
 This  row of  large  commercial  buildings  lies  along the
 
railroad  tracks  in  Frenchville,
 ME.
 The  railroad,
 
although  still  of  some  importance,  is  no  longer  the
 
primary mover  of  goods,  and  there  are many  areas  like
 
this one in which most of the buildings have been either
 
abandoned or converted to another purpose.

 A twin barn near U.S. Highway 1 in eastern Fort Kent, ME;
 
these  side-by-side  twin  barns  are  an  important  type;
 
there are only a few still standing.

 Looking  west  along  U.S.
 1  in  Fort  Kent;  the  large
 
building in the center is St.  Louis Catholic Church.
 
8-9
 Heading north in Fort Kent along State Highway 11.
 Note
 
the row of large warehouses near the center of the photo;
 
most of these are potato houses, which were used to store
 
the  produce  prior  to  shipment  by  railroad.
 Today,
 
potatoes are shipped by truck, and many trackside houses
 
like these are either abandoned or converted to another
 
use.
 The river seen here is the Fish River,  a tributary
 
of the St.  John.
 
10
 Forest and farmland in either Fort Kent or Wallagrass,
 
ME;  the pattern of fields and roads suggests the French
 
long-lots.
 At  least  some  portion  of  this  land  now
 
forested was probably farm at one time.
 
11-12
 Soldier  Pond,
 along  the  Fish  River
 in  Wallagrass.
 
Several potato houses can be seen in this photo; the ones
 
to  the  right  (#11)  and  center  (#12)  belong  to  potato
 
grower Herman Deprey of New Canada,  ME.
