Entered according to Act of Congress. in the year 137o, by A. J. FISHER, 
in the Office of the Librariaa of Congress, at 1Vashington. 
W E, the undersigned, respectfully take pleasure in intro= 
ducing to the public this volume of our own original and 
latest songs, and take pleasure in stating that all of the en-, 
closed songs that are credited to our singing were originally 
written by us, and sung with great success throughout the 
United States. 
Hoping they will be cheerfully received and 
appreciated, 
We remain, 
The Public's Popular In 
li Specialty and Sketch Artists, 
MURPHY and MA CK. 
The Two McMullet's. 
Original words and music by JOHN E. 
MURPHY, and sung- by Mokrny 
and MAC!:. 
We are the two McMullen, 
As ye all do know, 
A 
little Irish dancing 
To ye we're going to show. 
We landed in this country 
Just fifteen years ago, 
And for making money 
You bet we are not slow. 
CHORUS. 
It was in the garden I 
met you, darling, 
Where the shamrock grows, 
It was there you stole my heart, dear Barney, 
Just twenty years ago. 
Is that so ? 
It is so. 
Oh yes, it is so. 
Is that so ? 
It is so-
Oh yes, it is so. 
So now we're going to leave you, 
We bid you all farewell, 
And of us two McNIullens 
We hope you will speak well. 
We 
have to toil and labor 
Our apples for to sell, 
And when he gets elected 
To you he'll quickly tell. 
It was in the tTarden, 
President McMullen. 
Original words and music by JOHN E. 
MURPHY, and sung by him with 
great success at the London Theatre, New York, 
I 
am a 
politician of integrity and fame, 
I'm a 
candidate for the President, and McMullen, that's my 
name ; 
I'm the talk of all the city now, it's well I 
know my fate, 
Four dollar cigars will not be smoked when McMullen rules 
the State. 
CHORUS. 
I'll give you my idea, that is, I'll give you some, 
Of what McMullen intends to do when he's there in Wash-
ington. 
(Repeat.) 
I'll raise the laborers' wages, politicians' I'll reduce, 
Soap and sugar I'll give away, and all kinds of produce; 
All Chinese must emigrate, and go back home again, 
And when I'm there in Washington I'll stick to Senator Blaine. 
I'll give you my idea, &c. 
No crooked men in office, stealing money from the poor, 
Politicians will have no graft, or any sinecure; 
The world will be rejoicing, and my friends will propagate, 
And they'll all find money in the street when McMullen rules 
the State. 
I'll give you rry: idea, &c. 
Original words and music by JOHN E. 
M URPHY, and sung by M URPHY 
and M ACK. 
Good-evening to you, one and all, 
We ask your kind attention ; 
The subject of our song ' tis one 
To you all n6wWe'll make mention. 
It's about a 
day that's not far away, 
Though it comes but once a 
year, 
That's the time we'll all feel gay, 
On St. Patrick's Day in the morning. 
CHORUS. 
The bands will play, and the fifes will play, 
As down Broadway we'll march away ; 
That's the time we'll all feel gay, 
On St. Patrick's Day in the morning. 
Now if on that day we should meet, 
We hope you won't get offended, 
For what we say and do that day 
It never was intended. 
When we march out we know what we're about, 
That's the time the boys will shout; 
And before it's night we are kicked out 
Of the barrooms in the city. 
The bands will play, & e. 
We learned our marching in the war, 
We fought with George McClellan ; 
We was high private in the rear, 
This is the truth we're telling. 
And when we're out upon parade, 
We throw all others in the shade; 
We march along in the Fenian Brigade, 
On St. Patrick's Day in the morning. 
The bands will play, & c. 
We've just come down here for to sing you a 
song, 
And we tell you we're not going to keep you too long; 
If. you think that we are, you'll see that's where you're 
wrong, 
For we have to go home in the morning. 
My name is Tim Doolan—and my name is Pat, 
If you want to see dancing, just stand out of that; 
We're both Irish boys, from the crowns of our hats, 
And old Ireland is the land we were born in. 
CHORUS. 
For we're the boys the shillelah to whack. ( Break.) 
All over Cork county, to Limerick and back, 
We're known as the wild Irish rovers. 
We traveled to Connaught, from that to Tyrone, 
And we walked all the way to the bridge of Athlone; 
Through Dublin and Kerry and Wexford alone, 
We roamed all around through the clover. 
We sailed over to France, from that into Spain, 
And we're going to America by the next train ; 
So we'll bid you good-bye, but we'll come back again, 
And we'll still be the wild Irish rovers. 
For we're the boys, &c. 
The Greenhorn. 
Original words and musk by JOHN E. 
MURPHY, and sung by MURPHY 
and MACK with great success. 
We just dropped in to see you, friends, 
And hope yoa are all well, 
And of our emigration 
To you we'll quickly tell. 
We left our native country 
For to cross the briny sea, 
For to try and better our fortune here 
In sweet America. 
CHORUS. 
Then we can't forget old Ireland, and the Paddies evermore, 
And the rosy Irish lasses so enchanting, 
And the merry happy dances we had upon the floor, 
When we kicked away the boards with our dancing. 
[REPEAT.] 
There's a 
land that's in this world, my boys, 
We're praying hard to see, 
And we hope it won't be very long 
Before that she is free. 
For her rivers, her hills and her valleys 
Are so beautiful and grand, 
We would like to go back home again 
To our own dear native land. 
Written expressly for MURPHY and MACK by FRANK E. 
McMint. 
AIR 
" Biddy the Ballet Girl." 
I 
am in love with a 
bouncing fat girl, 
Who is known all over creation ; 
She beats the life out of Harrigan's Mary Ann, 
Or Dr. Landis for a 
good education, 
A masher she is called on the street, 
In the " Black Crook" she does the statues ; 
But lately she has canceled all dates, 
And is off her nut on walking matches. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, her front name she says it is Mary, 
And she is a 
bouncing fat fairy. 
It is no use to talk, she's a 
daisy to walk, 
She has the score-board all marked with long streaks of chalk. 
As around on the track she goes creeping, 
And time to the music keeps beating, 
The men they all shout, " Give it up, you're too stout !" 
But Mary sticks out to the finis. 
Next Monday night she starts out 
To try and beat Harriman and Ennis, 
And if they don't do better than before, 
I'm sure that their names will be Dennis. 
Next season she goes out with me, 
Then I'll be as proud as a 
lord. 
No danger of my trunk's getting stuck, 
For Mary'll walk off with the board. 
Oh, her front name, kc. 
Flannel Mouth Mick. 
Words and music by BILLY W ELCH, of W ELCH and RICE 
'Id respect-
fully dedicated to M URPHY and M ACK, 
I 
know you'll have pity 
When you hear what I 
say, 
The way I've been treated 
By the blackguards each day, 
Who stand around the corners 
As I 
pass them by ; 
You can hear them say plainly, 
Arrah, stag the old guy. 
CHORUS. 
For they yell out, you terrier, 
Go shoot that hat quick. 
For they call me a 
chaw 
And a 
flannel mouth Mick. 
The other day, while out walking, 
I 
went down the street, 
A 
charming young damsel 
I 
did chance to meet. 
Says I, you look charming, 
A cushla ma vick ; 
Says she, go drop cn yourself, 
You ould flannel mouth Mick. 
For they yell out, Sce. 
When election day comes 
Shure I 
know what they'll say, 
It will be, Mr. McGinnis, 
How are you to- day ? 
They'll hand me a 
ticket, 
Say, go vote it now, quick. 
I'm a 
gentleman then, 
And no flannel mouth Mick. 
Written by FRANK E. 
Mc.NtsH expressly for MURPHY and M ACK. 
AIR: 
" Forget Me Not." 
Oh, I'm in lore with all the girls, 
The short, the lean, and tall, 
And I 
know that they are gone on me, 
For after me they call : 
There goes the beau ideal of man, 
I 
wish he'd come this way ; 
But I 
surprise them all, indeed, 
When this to them I 
say— 
CHORUS. 
Get thee gone, you naughty girls, 
1'11 strike you with my stick ; 
If ever I 
blow my breath on you, 
I'll make you fearful sick. 
Your mamma she won't know you 
When you go home to hash, 
So keep away from me, I 
say, 
For I'm not on the mash. 
One young girl, she loved me so, 
She wanted me to elope ; 
One hundred thousand dollars had she, 
While my poor bank was broke. 
I 
says, young lady, you must know 
That I 
love single days ; 
Yourself or money I 
don't want, 
So this to her I 
says—

The Man that Stole the Country. 
Written by FRANK E. 
Mt:Nisi-I, expressly for M URPHY and M ACK. 
We'll tell you of a 
terrible thief, 
Who for stealing things could not be beat. 
He'd even steal the grub he'd eat, 
The man that stole the country. 
In his sleep he'd dream of what he'd done, 
And when he'd awake, the son of a 
gun. 
He'd get up and go out and steal for fun, 
The man that stole the country. 
CHORUS. 
He stole a 
horse, he stole a 
cow, 
A 
stack of hay and a 
cast-iron plow. 
He swiped a 
dog most dead with old age, 
A 
whole row of footlights off from a 
stage. 
Last night he came in this very place, 
And took the nose right off a 
man's face. 
All kinds of fish, from a 
whale to a 
perch, 
Even the steeple of Trinity Church. 
A 
pile of timber, a 
liberty pole, 
Stewart's body he must have stole. 
He was bred of a 
family of very bad rank, 
He stole all the bonds in Manhattan Bank. 
The Elevated Road he would have got 
If it hadn't been riveted to the spot. 
He'd steal the tongue out of your mouth 
While you would be talking; 
He stole the shoes off O'Leary 
While he was a 
walking. 
He stole a 
mule that was dying with cramps, 
Then went out West and collared all tramps ; 
Into a 
shop and sneaked out the boss, 
Over to Philadelphia and nipped Charlie Ross. 
In Gilmore's Garden he collared the track, 
He even tried to steal Murphy and Mack, 
THE MAN THAT STOLE THE COUNTRY. 
Continued. 
And still he wasn't satisfied— 
The man that stole the country. 
To Blackwell's Island he was sent, 
And life- time given to repent 
For things he'd done with bad intent— 
The man that stole the country. 
But the villain he was very bold, 
And prison walls could not him hold, 
And he's around again, so we're told— 
The man that stole the country. 
CHORUS. 
A 
pair of boots a 
tub, and a 
saw, 
The wonderful man with the cast-iron jaw. 
A 
full brass band, and a 
new piano, 
The ballot boxes in Louisiana. 
President Hayes' ulster and beaver, 
Went to New Orleans and took the fever ; 
Came to New York to steal Hell Gate, 
And he'd had it, too, if he hadn't been late. 
He stole a 
whole gang that were out on a 
lark, 
If he hadn't been watched he'd had Central Park. 
Stole a 
street car, the driver and all, 
Then went up anl took Tammany Hall. 
Took a 
cop right off from his beat, 
Stole all th.t bears there were in Wail street. 
To steal the City hail he often did wish, 
He took the false teeth away from McNish. 
He stole a 
house they had just finished building, 
Took Bessie Turner from Theodore Tilton. 
Into a 
school and nipped the teacher, 
He'd had Elizabeth, too, if it wasn't for Beecher. 
Stole some young folks that were playing backgammon, 
Went to the London and stole Murphy and Shannon, 
And still he was not satisfied— 
The man that stole the country.

Words and Music by TM ROGERS. 
GOOD-EVENING, neighbors all, I've come to make a 
call, 
I'm going to give you all a 
little warning, 
I 
haven't been this way for a 
week or so to-day, 
And now I've come to see my little darling. 
She's the sweetest ever seen, with her flounces trimmed in 
green. 
She's the primrose of Ireland, and her age is seventeen, 
It will be on next Sunday night when I 
wed that little queen, 
And I'm going to give you all an invitation. 
CHORUS. 
We will dance (sym.), and we will sing (sym.), 
And we will raise the very divil in the nation, 
Now, laddies, don't you fail, we will have a 
keg of ale, 
When I 
celebrate my Irish invitation. 
How happy I 
will be, when my Mary marries me? 
Then I 
will drive away all care and aggravation, 
Happy as the days are long, I 
will sing a 
little song, 
And I'll be the happiest man in all the nation; 
I 
will give a 
hearty cheer, and I'll take my glass of beer, 
I 
will drive away all trouble when I 
wed my little dear. 
Now don't forget to come, for I'm sure we'll have some fun, 
When I 
celebrate my Irish invitation. 
We will dance (sym.), etc.

SONG AND DANCE. 
Written for and sung by the PEASLEYS, Jon, and Lau. 
Words and Music by JOHN D. 
KELLY. 
HE— I'm an Irish boy, (SITE) I'm an Irish girl, 
BOTH—As 
you can plainly see; 
We dance with joy, and twist and twirl, 
So happy, gay, and free. 
HE—To dance and sing (SITE) '
tis our delight, 
Indeed it is quite true, 
We bring ourselves out here to-night, 
To sing and dance for you. 
CHORIJS. 
And we'll live in clover, now we have come over, 
To the land of America. 
(Repeat.) 
SHE—The picnic, fair, or fancy ball, we always do attend, 
For summer, winter, spring, or fall, invites they never 
end, 
To please our friends we always strivs, as in the dance 
we whirl, 
There's nor,- can keep the fun alive, like the Irish boy' 
and trill 
I'm an Irish, etc. 
THE Rt;s§ntis' greatest success, performed only by them in all the ?rib. 
cipal theatres throughout the United States. 
Good evening, kind friends, one and all, 
We came for to sing you a 
song, 
We'll try our best for to please you, 
And we promise we'll not keep you long. 
We came a 
great way across the ocean, 
Your kind faces all for to see, 
To tell you of all our misfortune, 
For two lonely widows are we. 
CHORUS. 
Ho—ho— 
All alone! 
For two lonely widows are we. 
If any of you want for to marry, 
And settle completely for life, 
Now it's Michael or Dennis or Larry_ 
Come step up and pick out your wife. 
We'll cook and we'll do all the scrubbing, 
Boil your eggs and your coffee and tea, 
We'll be easy and quiet and loving, 
For two lonely widows are we. 
(Music.) 
(Music.) 
Chorus and Dance. 
The Irish Alderman. 
Written and sung with marked success by KANE and FAvon. 
Kind friends, your attention we ask for awhile, 
And we'll tell to you a 
story very true; 
Sure we looked for work almost everywhere, 
We searched this city through and through, 
But at last we got a 
sinecure 
Over here in the gas-house, wheeling smoke ; 
They say that we are tart, 
Though we think we're very smart, 
Especially when we crack some dizzy joke. 
CHORUS. 
For we're so glad we will go mad, 
Sure we don't know what to do at all; 
It is plain for you to see that we're as happy as can be, 
For we're going to run for Alderman— next fall. 
When we sit down for to eat our meals 
You can bet that we sail into our hash ; 
With the girls we make free, 
We're their favorites, you see, 
Sure they say we're bang up on the mash. 
If we should get elected, 
We'll invite every one of you to call, 
We'll have corduroy stew, and mashed potatoes, t, 
And a 
ball down at Wallahalla Hall. 
For we're so glad, Sca. 
Written and sung by the " Irish Emperors," FAVOR and SHIELDS. 
Here we are, an Irish couple, from the County of Kildare, 
And we ask your kind attention for awhile ; 
And before we go away you will be sure to say, 
There is not an Irish couple with our style. 
We landed in America in the year of ' 62, 
Were both very proud to let you know ; 
So just keep your eyes upon us, and you'll say that we have 
manners, 
And we'll show you what an Irish pair can do. 
CHORUS. 
From morning until night to sing and dance is our delight, 
We're both very proud to let you know ; 
And for singing and for dancing sure we think we have no 
peers, 
As we'll plainly show to you before we go. 
0, now we must be moving, or you'll think that we're in-
truding, 
But we'll do another step before we go 
And when we're gone away we know that you will say 
There was none so neat upon their heel and toe. 
We're going to Kalamazoo, in the County of Tralu, 
We may never see your dear old faces more ; 
So now we bid adieu to every one of you, 
But it makes our poor old Irish hearts feel sore. 
From morning until night, &c. 
Sensible Park. 
Written and composed by K. 3. ENNIS, and sung by BONIFACE and ENNIS 
the Original Irish Greenhorns. 
Here we are, two Irishmen, 
Just come across the sea; 
Ye're looking well, God bless ye all, 
We are glad to see ye that way. 
Our brother he's an Assemblyman, - 
And he's as popular as Noah's ark, 
And when we did land he put in our hand 
A 
job for Sensible Park. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, Sensible Park! Sensible Park! 
From daylight till dark ; we're up with the lark, 
And all the girls sure we do spark 
Beyant in Sensible Park. ( Repeat.) 
They gave us charge of the animals; 
Sometimes we feed the monkey, 
And when we get their cage c:eaned out, 
Then we feed the donkey. 
The other day we got blind 
And we took a 
sleep in the elephant's trunk, 
And I 
tell you what it's a 
cosy bunk, 
Beyant in Sensible Park. 
There's the eagle and the elephants, 
The tiger and giraffe, 
And to see the tricks in the monkeys' cage, 
Begorra it would make you laugh. 
They have animals there from everywhere, 
And all the ropes and chains they tear; 
And that's the place to see the bears, 
Beyant in Sensible Park. 
Oh, Sensible Park, &c. 
Of all tile strangest girk on earth, 
I 
think my girl's the one ; 
You know she has peculiar ways, 
And quite devoid of fun. 
She never sees a 
joke of mine, 
'Whenever humor flows, 
But gives me a 
disdainful look 
And quite turns up her nose. 
SPOKEN—SOMC girls like a 
little joke, you know, but mine 
don't, she tum3 1:cr nose up at it. 
I 
think she works it on 
the same principle as this (turning up nose with _finger). 
CHORUS. 
Some girls do, and some girls don't, 
omc girls will, but my girl won't ; 
I 
tried very hard to see if she would, 
She sa:.I she really couldn't, and I 
don't think she could. 
I 
took my love to see the play, 
As other fellahs do ; 
And thought that she'd enjoy herself, 
She cried the whole night through. 
And when we reached the street again, 
Some oysters I 
proposed, 
But she said, " No, not me, young man," 
Still turning up her nose. 
SPOKEN—Up 
it went again at three dozen of the best 
Saddle Rocks, just think of that. 
To see a 
girl turn up her 
nose at five cents a 
time. 
I 
said, " Well, my love, if you 
won't have any supper, we will have a

She replied, " No, young man, no four-wheeled cabs for me 
at this time of night." 
Some girls do, &c. 
We met one Sunday afternoon, 
For a 
day in Central Park; 
And when we mounted " One tree hill" 
"We had, well, say a 
lark ! 
Georgina said, " You know, young man, 
Some girls prefer a 
stroll ; 
Not me, when I'm in Central Park 
I 
dearly love a 
roll!" 
SPOKEN—NOW, there's an extraordinary girl for you. 
Of 
course, I 
wanted to take her for a 
nice qttict lover's walk in 
some shady lane, but she said she'd prefer a 
roll. 
Then I 
wanted to talk to her of love, romance, and poetry, but no, 
she said she'd " sooner have a 
good dinner." 
Well, 
Some girls do, & c. 
Not long ago my uncle died 
And left me fifty pounds; 
As soon as I 
received the news 
My joy it knew no bounds. 
I 
thought, well, I 
will marry now, 
So I 
at once proposed; 
But when I 
mentioned the amount 
Up went her lovely nose. 
SPOKEN—The had girl, she said she ought to have five 
hundred with such a 
man as me. 
I 
thought she would have 
jumped at me, you know, for, 
Some girls do, &c.

As recited by DAN COLLYER, 
You may get through the world, but ' twill be very slow, 
If you listen to all that is said as you go; 
You'll be worried, and fretted, and kept in a 
stew, 
For meddlesome tongues will have something to do, 
For people will talk. 
If you're quiet and modest, you'll have it presumed 
That your humble position is only assumed; 
- 
You're a 
wolf in sheep's clothing, or else you're a 
fool, 
But don't get excited, keep perfectly cool, 
For people will talk. 
If generous and noble, they'll vent out their spleen, 
You'll hear some loud hints that you're selfish and mean 
If upright and honest, as fair as the day, 
They'll call you a 
rogue in a 
sly, sneaking way, 
For people will talk.

Topics of the Day. 
As sung by Miss LULU W ENTWORTH with great success. 
'Tis of a 
subject new I'm going to sing to you, 
Please give me your attention now I 
pray ; 
It's about the Silver Bill and whose pockets it will fill, 
Just listen now to what I'm going to say. 
Hard money at last has got the bill to pass, 
But to good old honest greenbacks we should cling. 
President Hayes made a 
veto, but he found it was a 
go, 
That shows that he's not solid with the ring. 
CHORUS. 
What does Congress mean to do to let such bills pass through? 
When they know our nation's debt we've got to pay. 
I 
thought it was but right to mention here to-night 
Some of the leading topics of the day. 
There's the Chinese question too,at Congress has pass'd through, 
There's enough of heathens in the Golden State ; 
Now fifty pounds, I 
am told, they have to pay in gold, 
Before they'll lie allowed to emigrate ; 
No more they'll wash the dirt from our collars, cuffs and shirts, 
We want no Chinese laundries in our land ; 
But still there's one thing more should be banished from our 
That's Sitting Bull and his 'bloodthirsty band. [shore, 
What does Congress mean, & e. 
There's little .1
-rrimy Blaine, from away down East in Maine, 
He knows he's dealing with a 
lot of loons, 
And Ben Butler he is great, both his eyes are getting straight, 
He's looking out for some more silver spoons. 
Bob Ingersoll as well is telling us of hell, 
And Beecher giving lectures on the same; 
I'm sure they'll meet there, for of sin they've done their share, 
And the devil on them both has got a 
claim. 
CHORUS. 
What does Plymouth mean to do if what Elizabeth says is true; 
They've expelled her from the church, the papers said. 
I 
thought it was but right to mention here to-night 
Some of the leading topics of the day.

Do, da, day, do, da, day, 
He's asked me already to name the day. 
Do, da, do da, day. 
(Business speaking. — I 
know you, you rascal; you are like all 
the rest of the young men.) 
You all do it; you all do it; you all do it; 
And some time you'll rue it; but you all do it. 
And don't you wish that you were me, 
There is no use saying no; 
The boys, they say, I'm just the thing, 
I 
suppose they ought to know. 
They say I've got such graceful style, 
And my laugh in the air keeps ringing, 
And then my dancing all 0. K., 
And you can't discount my singing. 
So let this world go as it may, 
You'll always find that I

To please you all is my delight. 
I'll sing and dance for you all night.

I'm the father of a 
bouncing girl, 
With cheeks like cherries red; 
She's a 
credit to the neighborhood, 
I'm only twelve months wed. 
When I 
come home from labor 
After toiling all the day, 
Me wife puts Nelly in rue arms, 
And this to to me did say— 
CHORUS, 
Arrah Patrick mind the baby, 
Arrah can't you mind the child( 
Tie it up in an over-coat, 
She's surely going wild, 
Arrah Patrick mind the baby, 
Mind the child awhile! 
She'll kick and bite, 
And cry all night, 
Arrah Patrick mind the child. 
There was castor-oil, and soothing syrup, 
And paregoric to, 
Was give to the child when she had fits, 
But nothing would bring her to; 
She'd put mustard plasters on her feet, 
And give her a 
bowl of tea, 
And then she'd lay her in my arms, 
And this to me would say— 
Arrah Patrick mind the baby, k4 
Ah when Nelly grew up to a 
lady, 
I 
had no control at tall; 
She'd say I 
am no baby, 
As she waltz away to a 
ball. 
Bad luck to me joy thete came a

Last St. Patrick's day;

And this to me did say—

I've not very long been over, 
But I'm smart enough at that, 
Though whenever I

The boys will holler " Pat." 
CHORUS. 
Oh, Paddy McCoy, from where did you come, 
You're a 
regular Irish mick ; 
Look at the flannel- mouth son-of-a-gun, 
And gaze on his blackthorn stick. 
In politics I'm a

In the Fourth Ward I

And with the boys the sugar divide. 
When any man wants an office, 
To me he is certain to come, 
I

If he planks down a

Come and have a

And if we can come to arrangements 
Why, Governor you surely will be ;

And cigars and whiskey too; 
Now, what wealth do you think you'll stand ? 
Just say a

There's a 
family lives next to me that keeps up a

All join in the chorus with the sister and his mother; 
When I

CHORUS. 
Working hard all day, I 
think it mighty hard, 
Climbing up a 
forty foot ladder, carrying a 
great big hod, 
When I 
get home at night, boys, to hear that terrible roar, 
Of Eileen Alanna and their augus asthore. 
Early in the morning, before I

Before I 
ate a 
mouthful, or before I 
drink a 
sup; 
They be singing in the hallway ' till my heart it is quite sore, 
• About Eileen Alanna and their augus asthore. 
If I 
had influence in the ward I 
do belong,

I'd have them all arrested, and that would stop their roar,

Sing to me the Last Rose of Summer—mamma, don't you cry, 
For in the clouds I'll raise a 
racket, in the sweet by and by.

Let me go bathing with the girls— it's naughty, but it's nice,

In these now hard, uncertain times, 
They do things very queer ; 
If you hav'nt got the ready cash, 
You cannot get your beer; 
The man behind the bar will say, 
Just by way of a 
joke— 
He'll shake his head with a 
meaning smile--
You know the slate is broke. 
CHORUS. 
You're welcome in, to spend your tin, 
To have a 
drink or smoke; 
But you'd better put the money up, 
For you know the slate is broke. 
When you're daily labor is ended, 
And to walk you feel inclined ; 
As you pass along the busy street, 
How many friends you'll find ; 
They'll say to you, come and take a 
drink— 
You'll return it with a 
smoke ;

For you know the slate is broke.

method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have

Courting; Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
V, meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means o( 
expressing one's sentiments in such a way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too dif31. 
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unlady-like encourage-
ment. As a 
result a 
this dilemma, many 
lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of cr:estions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affection., which fact makes further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties   •
