About Mark Cannon… 
 
Mark Cannon was born in 1951 in Hugo, Oklahoma and lived there until 1998 when he 
relocated to Shawnee, Oklahoma. Mark is the grandson of Vernon and Jewell Pratt who are 
credited with bringing to Hugo the first circus to establish winter quarters there. Vernon 
Pratt loved circuses and eventually would own and operate the James Christy Brothers 
Circus for around fifteen years. He trained horses and performed a Liberty Act. In 1947 
Vernon took the circus to Hawaii where Mark’s parents met where his mother (Betty Jean) 
was performing a trapeze act and his father was a local electrician. Vernon passed away in 
the early 1960s and the circus was sold. 
 
Mark graduated from Hugo High School during the time the Vietnam Conflict and joined 
the army reserves. He attended the University of Oklahoma for a couple of years and 
married his high school sweetheart (Mary Jane Jeffrey Cannon), a graduate of Oklahoma 
State University. They have been married for over forty years, have three children, five 
grandchildren, and reside in Shawnee, Oklahoma.

My name is Juliana Nykolaiszyn, also with me is Tanya Finchum. We’re 
with the Oklahoma State University Library, part of the Oklahoma Oral 
History Research Program. Today is Friday, June 15, 2012. We’re in 
Shawnee, Oklahoma, interviewing Mark Cannon. Thank you so much for 
joining us today. 
 
Thank you for coming. 
 
We’re going to talk with Mark today about the circus. This is part of the 
Circus oral history project we’re doing with the Library [of Congress]. 
We first want to learn a little more about you. Could you tell us the year 
you were born and where you grew up? 
 
I was born in 1951 in Hugo, Oklahoma. I lived there until 1998, 
currently live in Shawnee.  
 
Can you tell us a little about your parents? 
 
Well, I lost my mother a couple years ago. She was born and raised her 
whole life in Hugo. We’ll get into this later, but they met in the 
Hawaiian Islands, wherein as my grandfather took a circus over there. 
They met and got married. He was born and raised in the Hawaiian 
Islands. He moved back to Hugo and he lived there the rest of his life 
and died there. So, like I say, they’re both deceased. But my dad had a 
good life. He passed away when he was eighty-six and my mother was 
about the same age, too. That’s a little bit about me. 
 
Well, your family has deep roots in Hugo and a strong circus tie to the 
Hugo community. It all really starts with your grandparents. Can you 
tell us about your grandparents, their names and their profession?

Well, my grandfather’s name was Vernon Pratt. People from Hugo may 
recognize the name Pratt. There were several brothers, and they were all 
in the grocery store business. He had a fascination with circuses. He 
attended a circus, it’s my understanding, over in Arkansas. The circus 
was finishing up the year there. It was the end of their time for that year, 
and they didn’t have a place to winter, park everything. They repaint and 
rebuild and work on all the trucks and all that [during the winter]. So, 
my grandfather offered to let them come to Hugo and stay out in his 
pasture, a ranch that he owned south of Hugo.  
 
It’s my understanding that the next year, they came and stayed there 
again, and then they eventually bought property, the circus. The Millers, 
they own quite a bit of land on the east side of Hugo, now. It just kind of 
took off from there. As I was growing up, I can remember there being 
five or six different circuses. I lived out south of Hugo and there was one 
right across the street from us, across the highway. Out on the east side, 
there were several out there. That was my granddad, and then my 
grandmother was from there, too. She was a Patterson. Her name was 
Jewel Patterson. She passed away just a few years ago at 103. She was a 
great, great lady. That’s a little bit about them.  
 
At some point, did Vernon start a circus? 
 
He did. I was talking to my cousin, my mother’s sister’s son, it’s a 
shame these people passed away and we didn’t document it better. But I 
do know for a fact that as early as 1947, he had a circus because in 1947, 
he took a circus to the Hawaiian Islands on a ship. My cousin, which his 
mother, her name is Rita Joe. My cousin has shared with me on a couple 
different occasions that his mother remembered standing out in front of 
the ship and going under the Golden Gate Bridge. But anyway, he took 
the circus to the Hawaiian Islands. My father was an electrician there, 
and he worked for Hawaiian Electric. It’s my understanding that he 
stayed out at the circus area to make sure if something went wrong with 
the electricity that he would be there to manage it. At that point, they 
met, he met my mother. She was active in the circus as far as she did 
stuff on the trapeze and different things. A lot of the pictures that we’ve 
talked about, there’s pictures of her doing this stuff. Anyway, they met. 
And keep in mind, my dad, he was born and raised out on the Hawaiian 
Islands and lived in Honolulu. In about two weeks, they got married and 
he moved back to Hugo and lived there the rest of his life. He was 
probably born in ’21 and he came back in ’47, so he was probably 
twenty-five or twenty-six years old. And then he lived there for sixty 
years.  
 
That’s a big jump from Hawaii to Hugo.

I’m telling you. I’m telling you. (Laughter) If you’ve been to Hugo, you 
know it. But that’s how he got here and that’s a little bit of history that I 
know took place.  
 
When he and your mother returned to Hugo, what did they do? 
 
My father was in the propane business and he had a plumbing and 
electrical shop. He had some licensed plumbers, and that’s mostly what 
he did. He had a few other little ventures. They had a bowling alley. He 
had a miniature golf course. He got a truck and started selling propane to 
rural areas. It grew over the years and it supported us. It was a profitable 
business. We were never wealthy or anything, but we never lacked for 
anything. That’s what he did. My mother, she was in the florist business 
for years and years. I think probably twenty-five years. She did that up 
until just a few years before she passed away.  
 
So, did the tie to the circus end after they got back from Hawaii? 
 
No, I was discussing this with my cousin, trying to get some bearings on 
it and some facts. This was in like ’47. I know they were in Hawaii. I 
was born in ’51 and after my third grade year in school, I would have 
been probably ten years old. That would have been in ’61 or ’62. As 
soon as school was out, they were up in Kansas or Nebraska and I got to 
go up and go with the circus and stay with my grandmother and 
grandfather. We went through Nebraska and South Dakota, North 
Dakota. We went all the way up to the Canada border. So, I know he 
still had the circus in ’61 or ’62. So, that’s a span of fourteen or fifteen 
years. I know that it ended shortly thereafter because my grandfather, he 
passed away, I think, in September ’65. He had a heart attack. I know he 
hadn’t been active in the circus for several years, so that was probably 
’61 or ’62 was about the end of this deal.  
 
The name of that circus as I remember it was James Christy Brothers 
Circus. I can remember my grandfather, he ran the whole thing. But I 
would get up about four o’clock in the morning and go with my 
grandmother and we’d put out arrows for the trucks to know where to 
go. I remember I had a big stapler, it was like a hammer. She’d tell me 
which way to point them and point them down, tell them to slow down, 
right or left. I’d put them on trees or telephone poles and use that stapler. 
We’d get there early and then she would be responsible for getting food 
for everybody. They had a trailer with a kitchen in it. That’s a little bit of 
the time frame, as I remember. 
 
That’s quite an adventure for a young kid. 
 
Yes, like I say, I was about ten or eleven years old. I got to ride the

elephant every day, like in the grand entry. I’d ride the elephant and then 
they had a horse and they asked for somebody to come out of the stands. 
So, I’d go down there and I’d ride this horse. It’d run around the ring. It 
had a belt on and had a rope that went up to like a carwash that swings 
around. This horse would do it and I’d fall off. Of course, I wouldn’t fall 
off because I had the rope and had the big belt on that would catch me. 
I’d hold onto its tail and go around and round the ring. I was just a little 
kid, so it was pretty wild. 
 
What were the campers like at that time? 
 
What we stayed in? 
 
Yes. 
 
My grandparents, they had a—it looked like an old—I don’t think it was 
an eighteen-wheeler, but it was a tractor-trailer rig. It was just an old box 
trailer. It had a place up over the fifth wheel, and my grandmother was 
pretty good at fixing things up, making them look pretty. She turned it 
into a house that was pretty crude, but had the beds up over the fifth 
wheel. You step down and she had a little kitchen area. They conducted 
all the business there, the ticket sales and all that. It wasn’t much to it, 
but that’s what they lived in. That’s what they traveled in. It’s not like 
you see today. There weren’t Airstreams or Winnebagos or anything. 
(Laughs) 
 
I understand water was always an issue? 
 
It was always an issue. Weather. I saw some tents blow, literally, away. 
All the employees of the circus would have to—the tent would be on the 
ground, and they would have to—everybody that was with the show, 
they had to get out there and sew up the rips. So, it was a traveling, 
interesting deal.  
 
Did you have siblings? 
 
I had three sisters, one older and two younger. They were around it 
periodically. For some reason, I got to travel with it for about two and a 
half, three months. So, I got a little exposure to it. 
 
So, you attended all your school in Hugo, elementary and high? 
 
Oh, yes. I mean, the summer that I got to go, since school was out, I left 
and then I came back. I didn’t miss any school. But there were kids, and 
still are, that were home schooled and they would have to do their work 
as they traveled. But that wasn’t my situation. It was just an opportunity

for me to experience and be with my grandparents. 
 
You didn’t get the bug? 
 
I did not get the bug. (Laughter) Obviously, my grandfather had the bug. 
I wish I knew some facts and figures whether he really ever profited 
from it greatly or it was just something he wanted to do. If you’ve been 
around circuses, it’s a grind. Set up, tear down, move, weather and stuff 
breaking down.  
 
How many children did your grandparents have? 
 
Vernon and Jewel, they had two daughters—my mother, Betty Jean, and 
then Rita Joe. She was from Corpus Christi, and my mother was born 
and raised in Hugo. 
 
Did any of the grandkids get into the circus business? 
 
Never. No one ever went that direction. It’s interesting, down there, 
now—you mentioned you know the—you got to talk to the Byrds, and 
their kids have gotten into it. There’s the Rawls, one of their daughters. 
He finally kind of semi-retired. He’s active. He’s been the mayor and on 
the council and stuff. They had a daughter, and she married a young man 
named Fry, Frank Fry, and they took the circus out. So, I’ve seen 
instances where the siblings did follow them, but it didn’t happen in my 
family. 
 
Did they stay in the grocery business? 
 
No, he got out of the grocery business. Again, I don’t know the years, 
but there were years that he was doing some of both. Not at the end. 
Like I said, some of the old videos I have have pictures of the old 
grocery stores.  
 
We’ve heard some people say that he invested in other shows in town? 
 
You know, those are things that—I mean, I was fourteen or fifteen years 
old when he died. I never discussed the finances. I don’t think that my 
grandparents ever accumulated anything to speak of, but obviously, he 
got to do something he loved. I guess it supported him. But at the end, I 
doubt if it was sold for any amount of money.  
 
They liked it well enough to keep staying in Hugo, though.  
 
Yes, yes.

Found something else to do, too. 
 
And I think when people talk about Hugo and circus, his name is almost 
always brought up as being an important part of why Hugo has the 
circus. 
 
I think the Millers and the original circuses that were there appreciated 
the fact that he offered the place for them to winter. They were always 
grateful. I know in some of the articles you read, his name will appear 
periodically, giving him credit for kind of starting that—turned Hugo 
into Circus Town, USA. There’s still a lot of activity down there now. 
You all have been there. I haven’t kept up with it, but you know there’s 
the elephant breeding program, and there’s still a few circuses. It’s pretty 
interesting to go out there and look at. 
 
Did he ever perform on the circus or was he just the…? 
 
You know what, he didn’t perform. He was a nice looking man. He had 
a full head of hair when he passed away. He didn’t perform, but he 
trained horses and he worked those in show. I think they called it a 
Liberty Act. He had, I think, some of the videos, he had one set, they 
were like black or black and white horses. They’d go in circles and all 
turn at the same time, rear up, put their feet on the next horse’s back. He 
did that. I guess, probably, he was the ringmaster. My grandmother 
didn’t perform, but my mother and her sister, Rita Joe, both performed. 
There’s pictures, a lot of pictures and documentation of what they did.  
 
And what did they do? 
 
It was trapeze and stuff on ropes and… 
 
Swinging ladder… 
 
Yes, yes.  
 
Did your mother miss it? 
 
She didn’t do it. She passed her—I think there was seven years 
difference in my mother and father’s age. She got married when they 
were in Hawaii so she got out of it pretty quick. I don’t know the exact 
age, but she was probably eighteen, nineteen years old. That was the end 
of it for her. My grandfather had circuses after that and I know she 
wasn’t active.  
 
And her sister?

Same way. She didn’t stay in it, either. When they went to the Hawaiian 
Islands, I’m going to guess she was probably fourteen, fifteen years old. 
 
Are your grandparents buried there in Hugo? 
 
Yes, they are. They’re not buried in what they call the Showmen’s Rest. 
They’re buried east of there, probably three or four hundred yards. I 
don’t know that in ’64, when my grandfather died, that that was started 
yet. I don’t know. Y’all may know the history of Showmen’s Rest, when 
it was started. 
 
Mid-’60s, I think. 
 
Mid-’60s, yes. Of course, it’s real popular that when you buy two plots 
you’ll be buried next to each other. So, they’re close, but not in that area. 
 
When was the last time you were at a circus? 
 
It’s been a while. (Laughter) I have a son that lives in Greely, Colorado, 
and my wife’s brother lives in Fort Collins. The circus from Hugo was 
in Estes Park just recently. They all went up to it. So, a little contact 
there. Some of our kids—I have a daughter that lives in Dallas, and she 
went to school with some of the kids that are on the circus now. She still 
knows them. I think they have a little contact, keep in touch.  
 
Well, the circus is a big part of the Hugo community. Growing up, could 
you tell a difference in town? 
 
It’s interesting. I don’t know what people’s perception of circus people 
are. This isn’t a knock on carnivals, but some people may, not 
necessarily to be ugly, but you talk about carnies or that kind of thing. I 
can tell you that the circus people—my father was in the propane 
business, in the plumbing, electrical. These people, when they came in, 
obviously they would get all their funds probably before they went back 
out. My dad did a lot of business with these people. A lot of them would 
leave town owing him money, and he always said that he never got 
cheated. They always paid. They were a high-class bunch of people. 
 
Of course, now, there’s a lot of acts that come from Argentina, Mexico, 
that kind of stuff. You can tell a difference. When these people came 
back into town, they were an impact financially. They spent a lot of 
money. They bought auto parts and food. There is a lot of people that 
benefitted from trading. Now they have events to welcome them in, and 
they usually have the first show there before they go out on the road. 
They’ll open in Hugo. So, yes, you were always real aware of it. You’d 
go down Kirk Street, which is where the circuses are, and there’d be

twenty-five or thirty elephants tied up, one after the other. Go out there 
and see—where can you go to see a whole herd of elephants? Pretty 
interesting. 
 
You lived there during the time that D.R. was still around. Did you have 
any interactions with him? 
 
Not really. I can see him just plain as day, but I didn’t have any dealings 
with him. I knew who he was and met him and talked to him, but don’t 
remember a whole lot about him. I’m sure y’all have documented that he 
died on the road and they froze him and waited until they came in where 
they could have a proper—quite a lot of fanfare. Pretty interesting. 
 
Were you down there for the funeral? 
 
I was not. I’m sure you’ve seen some articles. There’s some big articles 
written about it. 
 
Looking back on your family’s legacy in the circus, how do you hope 
people remember Vernon Pratt? 
 
Well, it’s my memory that they were well-liked and thought of in the 
community. My grandmother, she was probably the finest, strongest 
Christian woman I’ve ever met. She was remarkable. Of course, he died 
at a pretty young age, but I think they were very well thought of. It’s just 
that I didn’t get to experience my grandfather near as long as I did my 
grandmother. She was here just a few years ago. But they were well-
known in the community. Of course, it’s not a very big community, but I 
think everybody knew them. They had a good reputation. I don’t know if 
that’s exactly what you’re asking me. 
 
How do you stay informed of what’s going on in Hugo? 
 
Just about everybody has passed away, but I still have some friends 
down there. I owned some real estate stuff down there until recently. 
Like I say, I’ve got some friends. My mother and father were divorced 
along the way. He remarried and we’re close to his second wife, my 
step-mother. She’s a great lady. We go down and we see her. We still 
have contacts down there. We end up back down there, so we kind of 
keep up. Pretty informed about what’s going on. Can’t live someplace 
for that period of time… 
 
After high school what did you do? 
 
After high school I went to college. The Vietnam War was going on. I 
joined the army reserves, went to basic training, came back and went to

OU for a couple years and kind of hooked back up with my high school 
sweetheart that I’d been chasing since the third grade. (Laughter) We got 
married and that’s about forty years ago and we’re still married. That’s 
kind of the whole thing in a nutshell. I came here in ’98. I’d been in the 
insurance business and transferred here. It’s been a good move, we enjoy 
living here. 
 
I guess we can say on camera—why OU instead of OSU? (Laughter) 
 
Yes, I said OU, didn’t I? I said a bad word, didn’t I? (Laughter) 
 
That’s all right. 
 
My wife graduated from OSU.  
 
Well, good! 
 
But I have two sons who graduated from OU. 
 
Well, we won’t hold it against you. 
 
So, if you go look in the closet in there, there’s… We go to all the 
football games and stuff, so she’s kind of converted. (Laughter) 
 
Well, you kind of keep your finger a little bit on the pulse of the circus. I 
mean, you grew up in an area that is known for the circus.  
 
Yes. 
 
Where do you think the circus is going to go in the next ten to twenty 
years? I know it’s kind of hard to predict. 
 
Yes. It’s got to be a tough business. I will say this. I don’t know that my 
grandparents ever made a lot of money in the circus. I don’t want to 
speak for the Millers, but I know they’ve done really well. Gee, I don’t 
know. I guess if it’s in somebody’s blood, they can make it happen. I 
guess if you get bit by the bug, I guess that somebody can make it work. 
Like I say, it’s a tough life. I don’t know who is left of that deal. The 
Byrds have a couple daughters, I don’t know, are they involved? 
 
Yes. 
 
I don’t know how old Geary is, but they’re not that young anymore. But 
when I go down there, I have to make the circle and just kind of look at 
it. It’s not that I know what’s going on, but just something…

Where in Hugo was the original Pratt property? 
 
The ranch?  
 
Yes. 
 
I call it the ranch. Go south of Hugo like you’re going to Paris. You 
know where the road splits and turns into a four-lane? You go about two 
miles and there’s a cut in the road there, a crossroad, and there is a sign 
that says, “Goodland.” You ever seen that?  
 
Yes.

highways. There’s the four-lane and what they call the old highway. If 
you turned to go down to Goodland, he owned pretty much from the 
highway all the way down to Goodland. That’s where they wintered. 
That’s where a lot of the—even he had his stuff there. That’s where he 
trained the horses and all that stuff. 
 
Is that property still in the family? 
 
No. The old house is still up on the hill. I always kind of wished I owned 
it because of the memories. I kind of grew up up there. A guy named Joe 
Anderson bought it. I don’t know that it’s still in their family. He’s not 
alive, and I don’t know if his wife Bernice is or not. But I don’t know 
who owns it now, to be honest with you.  
 
As a third grader, what part of the circus did you enjoy the most? 
 
Gee, I don’t know. I was real involved in it, like I told you earlier. I got 
to ride the elephant and the horses, and I’d go eat with the rest of the 
people. It wasn’t much of a vacation. It was the same deal. It was seven 
days a week. I don’t know that I had to do any work so it was an 
adventure more than anything else. What my grandmother tried to do is 
we would go different places. She would show me—we went to the 
Black Hills. I remember we went to the Corn Palace. I can remember, 
but there wasn’t a lot of time for it. It was a grind. It wasn’t anything 
easy about it. 
 
There’s a lot of work.

It was a lot of work. Something was always broke or dragging a truck in 
or some problem, somebody not getting along. It was a tough life.  
 
You got to eat in the cookhouse with the rest of…? 
 
The cookhouse. I was trying to think of what to call that a minute ago, 
but it was a cookhouse.  
 
Did they have to sit in certain places? Did you have assigned seats? 
 
No, I remember tables and just benches. I guess the food was okay. I 
don’t remember it being bad, but it probably wasn’t five star cuisine. 
 
Or you could have popcorn later. 
 
I think I could have all the popcorn and cotton candy that I wanted. I 
remember I got a splinter in my hand and got blood poisoned. I had to 
go get some shots, but I didn’t ever… Thinking back, if I had a kid in 
the third grade and I’d known he was doing the things I was doing, I’d 
probably have had a fit. But nothing ever happened. The elephant they 
had, his name was Hank. It’s my understanding that he killed a couple 
men. They ended up destroying him. Shooting and killing him, putting 
him to sleep, whatever. I rode him in that grand entry every day. He’d 
lift his leg up and I’d shimmy up there. They had a big harness on him, 
and I’d hold on to that and… Pretty good memories. 
 
Just your normal summer vacation. 
 
Yes, how many third graders get to go to the circus for…? 
 
Do you remember some of the smells? 
 
Yes. Oh, yes. They were probably unique. Probably in the cook trailer or 
what you called it a minute ago… 
 
Cookhouse. 
 
Cookhouse, yes. The canvas, they’d roll that canvas up and had a big 
truck that that rolled it up. That’s the first thing, they’d unroll that 
canvas and they’d use the elephant just like you see. You saw the movie 
that was recently out. If you read that book, there is even some mentions 
of a couple circuses that were in Hugo. Other memories I had was is that 
we grew up south of town. I mentioned where my grandfather’s ranch or 
whatever was. Well, the property actually started where I grew up. It 
was the old highway and then the property started. They came in and cut 
through with the four-lane that goes from Hugo to Paris. Across the road

from us, there was a circus called Cole Circus. I can remember going up 
there. There was a barn they kept the elephant in there. There was a 
gentleman, his name was Tandy, T-A-N-D-Y. I’d go up there every day 
and hang around. They wintered there. I had a lot of exposure there. I 
remember he was my buddy. I was a little ole kid. He was my buddy. I 
made him a pineapple upside down cake. I baked it and I was taking it to 
him. I was crawling over this fence, and I remember I dropped it and it 
landed right upside down and it just splattered on the ground. (Laughter) 
Had to go and make him another one. But anyway. 
 
Good memories. 
 
Yes, good memories. 
 
What are some of the other circuses you remember from Hugo? 
 
Well, there was Carson Barnes and Al G. Kelly Miller Brothers and 
there was my grandfather’s circus. At least one of them I remembered 
was James Christy Brothers, and I don’t even know who James Christy 
was.  
 
Haven’t come across that name. 
 
Al G. Kelly Miller Brothers was, I guess, the big, the original. Then 
Carson Barnes kind of spurred off of there. Y’all probably know more 
history about it than I do.  
 
I’ve read of a Stephens Brothers. Does that ring a bell? 
 
There was a Stephens Brothers. I think my grandfather was associated 
with Stephens Brothers. See, that’s what’s a shame. Everybody is gone, 
and we don’t have—obviously, he had the bug or he wouldn’t have done 
the thing, but it’s just a little bizarre that somebody would put that stuff 
together. I don’t know if it was for the love of the road or the 
entertainment.  
 
And not having had done it before or been exposed to it. 
 
Yes, because he was probably—he was sixty-five when he died, sixty-
four, sixty-five. He died in ’65, so he was probably born about the turn 
of the century. So, he was probably around pushing fifty when he started 
the thing. It’s not like he—his family wasn’t in it. He didn’t inherit it. He 
wasn’t brought up in it. He just got the bug at middle age and decided to 
do it. 
 
And it worked for a while. And to go to Hawaii with it…

Yes. And there’s his kids right on the front of the boat. I guess it looked 
like something from The Titanic, going under the Golden Gate Bridge. I 
spoke with a gentleman recently that took a sailboat across. It took him 
about three weeks. They were probably out in the middle of the water 
for at least a couple weeks, ten days or something.  
 
Well, it’s a good family legacy. 
 
I can’t stress—not just necessarily my parents, but from what I know, 
the Rawls—you’ve met David and Bobby—when I moved here, I had 
been in the Lion’s Club with their father, Harry. I’m telling you, he was 
as nice a guy as I’ve ever met. He always spoke well of my granddad. I 
mean, they were good people. Everything I know about the Millers and 
Rawls, all those people that are still down there and their kids, they’re 
high class, good people. There wasn’t any crimes. You didn’t hear 
anything about stealing or anything bad going on. It was a very 
honorable bunch of people.  
 
Hardworking, too. 
 
Yes, guarantee you they work. 
 
Everybody worked. 
 
Everybody worked. Yes, it was interesting. You had multiple roles. I 
think even the performers had to chip in and help.  
 
Is there anything else you’d like to add or tell us today? 
 
No, I wish I was more of a history buff, but I’ve tried to pick—when you 
all called and talked to my wife, I kind of tried to pick everybody’s brain 
about stuff. Everybody’s kind of—we didn’t document any of that, so. I 
know it all happened because I was there and I have videos and you’ve 
seen pictures of it. Just kind of an interesting lifestyle for those people. 
 
And you can say you rode an elephant. 
 
Rode an elephant. All my family got to ride elephants. In all the home 
videos, everybody rode elephants.  
 
They were all Hank or different ones? 
 
Oh, no, they were different elephants. I just remember this particular… 
He’d do a show and they had like an eighteen wheeler. This elephant 
lived in the back half of it, probably a somewhat cruel life. But I

remember he’d get mad and he’d hit on the steel cage. But that breeding 
program down there is… 
 
Amazing. 
 
Yes. 
 
Well, thank you so much for giving us a little bit of background on your 
grandparents. We really appreciate it. 
 
Yes, I’d like to see the whole thing put together. I could probably learn 
some stuff.  
 
Thank you very much.
