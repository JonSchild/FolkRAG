PREFACE., 
Ir having become customary, in editing a 
work 
like the present, to address a 
few lines to the 
reading public—in acknowledgment of the gene-
ral custom, we claim the kind indulgence of our 
friends, the admirers of Ethiopian Lyrics, and the 
musical portion of the public in general. 
It is not 
our intention to trouble them with an elaborate 
and fulsome memoir of ourselves, so customary to 
Ethiopian performers; but, in our humble opinion, 
more honored in " the breach than the obser-
vance," retaining, as we do, the recollection of 
Dr. Pangloss' pithy observation, " Of their own 
merits, modest men are dumb;" therefore it is very 
evident, on perusal of many preceding works of a 
similar description, that the gross flattery, incorrect 
statements, and injudicious 
praise, so profusely 
spattered over many of our prominent colored 
8 
Preface. 
troubadors, is not only injudicious, but to use a 
more 
vulgar but very expressive phrase, it is " played 
out;" indeed so much so as to often make the un-
happy object blush (if possible), and exclaim, " Pre-
serve me from my friends!" 
The subject of our present notice, Mr. JAMES 
UNSWORTII (as many of our readers are aware), has 
suddenly sprung up into the notice and highest 
estimation of an appreciative New York public, and 
although a young performer, scarcely out of his 
teens, is already recognized as a 
star of the first 
magnitude amid the Ethiopian constellation, so 
much admired by our New York star gazers. 
And no matter to what peculiar or particular 
part of the black art his efforts have been directed, 
either as an original Banjoist, a 
composer of the 
celebrated Irish Quartettes (a 
new feature), or as a 
general performer, the applause and success his 
humble efforts 
to 
please have been rewarded 
with, either at the Bryant Brothers, or at the 
Campbell's Minstrels, render any encomiums of 
ours superfluous, and entirely unnecessary, bear-
ing always in mind the old adage, " Good wine 
needs no bush," and that an appreciative public 
are, in themselves, the best judges of the relative 
merits of various performers. 
It certainly is, to 
- '.• 
Preface. 
one of our profession, a 
great pleasure to notiCe 
the gradual advance of Ethiopian minstrelsy during 
the last ten years. 
Instead of the itinerant pro-
fessors of Negroraancy, who formerly were 
the 
terror of country hotel keepers, and the dread Of 
hedge-drying washerwomen, the 
profession 
has 
elevated itself, and now ranks among its numbers 
artists of considerable and acknowledged talent, as 
vocalists, instrumentalists, pantomimists, and first-
rate comedians; while poets, authors and compo-
sers contribute their best efforts to the advance-
ment of an amusement that is decidedly American 
in its origin, and is justly popular in almost every 
quarter of the globe. 
Its songs are heard from the 
boudoir of the fashionable Fifth Avenue beauty, to 
the workshop of the industrious sewing girl; while 
the splendid brass bands, which parade our streets, 
peal forth our melodies, only to be caught up again 
by the brave firemen, the vociferous newsboys, and 
all Young America generally—a// reecho the wel-
come strains of the minstrel. 
And when we look 
around and see the splendid halls in our principal 
streets nightly crowded by enthusiastic admirers 
we can perceive at once that Ethiopian minstrelsy 
is a 
National Institution, and can lay a 
just claim 
to a 
rank among the pioneers of musical civiliza• 
lo 
Preface. 
tion; and will, as long as our glorious banner floats 
around us, ever have and hold, in the American 
heart, a 
local habitation and a 
name. 
In conclusion, the author, in presenting this col-
lection, has yielded to the earnest solicitation of 
numerous friends to publish these, his original pro-
ductions, in the hope that they will not only be 
well received, but useful to the profession; and 
trusts that this, his first effort, will meet with the 
indulgence and approbation of 
his 
professional 
brethren and his kind patrons. 
UNSWORTH'S 
The Stage Driver. 
Composed by Unsworth. 
• 
Now white folks pay attention, Ise gwane to sing a 
song, 
I 
hope it's going to please you, though it isn't very 
long: 
It's about one of the old boys, so gallious and so 
fine, 
For he drove an omnibus on the Knickerbocker line. 
He was such a 
favorite wherever he went, 
And he never was known to knock down a 
cent, 
Ile slung a 
graceful whip, for he was bound to 
shine 
Like a 
high salary'd driver on the Knickerbocker 
line. 
He was driving down Broadway, the other arternoon, 
When just as he was passing a 
lager bier saloon, 
'Twas there he spied a 
young gal, the prettiest e'er 
was seen, 
She'd just arrived that morning from the Jersey 
quarantine. 
Oh, whar are you going, young woman ? he said; 
She guy him a 
look, dat like to kill him dead— 
She handed up her band-box, and den got up her-
self— 
She so exprized George Henry, dat he nearly lost 
his breff.

He thought he'd caught an heiress, a 
Southern Lucy 
Neal, 
Like the galliaut French capting and the maid of 
Says she, the sun am very hot, gib me half of your 
umbrella, 
My name is Miss Plehimmeson, and I 
peddles Sasa-
parilla. 
When George heard this news, which couldn't have 
been wus, 
His mug, it did turn yellow, and he rolled off' the 
bus, 
Dey bathed his head in winegar, to take away the 
scars, 
And now he's driving mules on the Second avenue 
cars. 
Unsworth's Lament. 
Pathetic Refrain. 
Now colored folks and citizens, I 
pray listen unto 
me, 
And darkey musicians, jes keep your strings in 
tune, 
For Mary Jane has gone from me, de police did get 
hold of she, 
She's up on Blackwell's Island for nipping silver 
spoons. 
CEtoaus.—So darkies all, and citizens, listen to him 
while he sing, 
He's going to run for alderman de next election 
day. 
Her brother's name am Weller, and he am a 
clever 
feller, 
And he used to sell umbrellers on the wet and 
rainy days, 
Burnt Cork Lyrics. 
But he travelled on his muscle, so that clobber man 
Judge Russell, 
He sent him up to Sing Sing to try and mend his 
ways. 
Cnottus.—So darkies all, and citizens, listen to him 
while he sing, 
lie's going to run for alderman de next 
election day. 
When Mary Jane is free again, we'll hab a

tion, 
So d 
irkies, I 
invite you all, and Stephen you come 
too. 
And when my troubles all are o'er, Ise gwane to 
keep a 
candy store— 
I'll wrap myself in de 'Mcrican flag, a 
hoop-de-
doodden-do. •

Opening Chorus from Lombardi. 
Written by J. II. Collins. 
FL.IG of Freedom our country en -
shrining, 
For thy fame thy brave sons so erullring, 
In one band for thy glory combining, 
Glorious liberty, bravely have won, 
And our glorious flag now securing, 
Free from insult as it floats on the breeze— 
By thy children forever protected, 
Star of empire, o'er land and o'er seas. 
Fairest land, where the murmuring breezes 
Gently ruffle the stream as it floweth, 
Where the sweetness of spring never ceases, 
And its fragrance is ever renewed.

Unsworth's 
Ah! how joyous, when memory painteth, 
All the joys that our loved home bestoweth, 
For your welcome the worn traveller fainteth, 
But your presence soon banishes pain, 
Home, home again, again; home, home again. 
To our loved homes again now returning, 
Where kind hearts and sweet smiles so alluring, 
Through our journey one danger appalled us, 
'Twas the thought we might never return, 
But your presence again now securing, 
Ne'er again shall our hearts feel neglected, 
And we feel all our hopes were protected 
By the kind friends who welcome us home. 
Fairest land, where the murmuring breezes 
Gently ruffle the stream as it flowed], 
Where the sweetness of spring never ceases, 
And its fragrance is ever renewed.

how joyous, when memory painteth 
All the joys that our loved home bestoweth, 
For your welcome the worn traveller fainteth, 
But your presence soon banishes pain. 
Home, home again, again; home, home again. 
Peanut Gal. 
(Comic Banjo aong.) 
By Unsworth. 
Now gather round me, colored folks, and listen to 
my ditty, 
It's all about a 
lubly gal, she libed in dig great city, 
Oh she libed wid her mother up seven pair 
Of stairs, in the Bowery street, near Grand, 
But her business place was on Broadway, 
Where she kept a 
peanut stand. 
There was a 
young policeman smiled on her, 
And he bought her peanuts too, 
Burnt Cork Lyrics. 
And she fell in lub wid his German silver star, 
And his lovely coat of blue. 
They loved each other like the shanghai 
Fowls, that walk about in spring, 
And he took her up to Jones' Wood, 
To hear the Dutchmen sing. 
She vowed she'd love him ever more, 
And ne'er from him would stray, 
But she shook him and left wid an organ 
Grinder, the boys called him old dog Tray. 
They give curbstone concerts on rainy days, 
Which has giv the young gal a 
bad cough, 
And the jealous young policeman, in revenge, 
When he sees 'em, he hollers Walk off! 
Called out Three Times. 
Mr. GINGER, I 
understand that you are an actor. 
Oh, yes sir! 
I 
played a 
star engagement at Ho-
bocken, under a

Ah! 
How did you make out? 
Make out! 
I

Indeed! Who by? 
Twice by de sheriff, and once by de washerwo-

Fond Memories. 
(A Ballad.) 
Words by Unsworth. 
How loved the haunts of childhood's days, 
Sweet scenes of youth to memory dear, 
My boyhood's home, e'er life's sad phase 
Had taught me there was aught to fear. 
Dear happy home of childhood's days, 
On thee may heaven's brightest rays 
Be shed around thee, lovely spot, 
By me thoult never be forgot. 
In life's short journey, oft we pause, 
To think o'er scenes too sweet to last, 
Though they to sadness may give cause, 
We prize as memories of the past. 
Dear happy home of childhood's days, 
On thee may heaven's brightest rays 
Be shed around thee, lovely spot, 
By me thou'lt never be forgot. 
The Female Smuggler. 
By J. II. Collins. 
IN 
sailor's clothing young Jane did go, 
Dressed like a 
smug-gu-lar, from top to toe, 
With a 
brace of pistuols all by her side, 
Like a 
warlike hero, like a 
warlike hero in all her 
natural pride. 
(Last line repeated in Chorus.) 
What do you mean ? says the commodore. 
I

She took her seven inch revolveure, 
And she shot him through, then to her parient flew.

Unsworth's 
The police they followed her, all to arrest, 
Iler sailor's clothing Jane put in her chest. 
They searched the cabin of her father's ship, 
And they found young Jane preparing for a 
trip. 
In her natural garments they dressed young Jane, 
And when the commodore did ascertain, 
Oh, the commodore, he felt quite well, 
And he felt much better, and he felt much betterer, 
he was nursed by a 
nice young gal. 
Now when young Jane at the bar did stand, 
IIe made her (this is the commodore) an offer of his 
heart and hand, 
And the female smuggn'ar and commodore, 
Lived for ever happy, and have little smuggulars a 
dozen now or more. 
MORAL. 
Now all young ladies what follow the sea, 
Take my advice, fight for victory. 
The female smuggular was nobly wed, 
.And she lived quite happy till she was dead.

The Charcoal Man. 
(Banjo Bong.) 
By U us wor th. 
IN 
Brooklyn city there used to dwell a 
gal unknown 
to fame, 
Her mother's name was Mary Ann, and hers was 
Mary Jane. 
Every morning in the summer time, she crossed the 
briny river 
To her market stall, where she sold fresh tripe, and 
sassangers, likewise liver. 
There was a 
gallant charcoal man, McClosky was 
his name, 
His fighting weight was seven stone ten, and he 
loved sweet Mary Jane. 
He drove her out in his charcoal wagon, 'twas on 
St. Patrick's day, 
When his donkey took fright at a 
Jersey man, and 
started down Broadway. 
They both did holler with all their might at the 
donkey for to stop, 
But he upset Mary Jane, wagon and all, right into a 
policy shop. 
When McClosky saw this cruel thing, his heart was 
moved to pity, 
So he stabbed his donkey with a 
piece of charcoal, 
and started for Salt Lake City.

(Song.) 
Words by J. II. Collins. 
'TWAS on the old plantation, not many years ago, 
Our work was done, at set of sun, we quit the spade 
and hoc; 
And on the green were darkies seen, in many a 
happy row, 
Dancing to the music of the bones and ole banjo. 
Our hearts were light, the moon shone bright, kind 
plasm he was dere, 
For nothing did hint more delight, our joys and 
sports to share.

Oh, I've come home, come home again, to lay me 
down and die. 
We stop de dance, we quit de song, and search de 
fields around, 
Beneath a 
tree, on bended knee, an aged man we 
found. 
'Twas poor old Joe, who years ago, to other lands 
did roam, 
Far from the spot whar he was born, from massa, 
friends and home. 
But he grew old, the world got cold, kase he could 
work no more, 
Forlorn and grey, he begged his way to his old 
massa's door. 
Oh, pardon, pardon, mama dear I 
was his last fee-

For I've come home, come home again, to lay me 
down and die. 
Unsworth's Headings 
From the New York Ledger. 
BONES, what are you reading there ? 
Why, Mr. Johnson, I'm reading a 
story in de 
Ledger. 
A 
story! what kind of a 
story? 
Oh, it's one of dem short-hand stories. 
What do you mean by a 
short-hand story ? 
Why a 
short-hand story is one where each word 
means a 
wolume. 
It's written by a 
friend of mine, 
a 
Mr. Corncob. 
Ah, indeed! 
Well give us a 
synopsis of it. 
I

Just as like as not.

Ah, sir; I 
see you don't understand what I 
mean. 
Read it for us. 
Well, here's the 
FIRST CHAPTER. 
'Twas morning—and as the sun rose above the 
western horizon, a 
solitary horseman might have 
been seen descending the mountain. 
He alights at 
a 
cottage, and speaks to a 
fair damsel a 
few hurried 
words. 
She enters the cottage. 
He mounts his 
horse, and rides away. 
End of the first chapter. 
CHAPTER DE TWO TIMES. 
Two big Dutchmen in the distance, one wid a 
sassao-e machine, de oder wid a 
meat axe. 
They speak. 
Listen! 
Ich can der Deutch vorstay, for ich wall nix der 
Inglish gasproken. 
Vendersay Speclenback's de

vil de fetch him out. 
They approach a 
cottage, and call for refresh-
ment. 
Young lady appears and waits upon them, 
but does not recognize her father and her brother. 
You see, Mr. Johnson, de old man's got a 
blan-
ket round him, and she cannot recognize the invisi-
bility of his incognito. 
Do you see ? 
I 
see. 
Go on, sir. 
Dutchmen separate hastily to meet again in am-

Billy White. 
(Comic Song.) 
With Original Verses, by J. H. Collins. 
KIND people listen to my song, 
I'll not detain you very long, 
It's all about one William White, 
Who was his parients' hearts' delight. 
CIIORIIS.-Right fol tiddle liddle 101, right fol lol lol 
liddle diddle lay. 
He courted Miss Jemima Green, 
As pooty gal as never was seen. 
And he was rather fond of she, 
But she wasn't quite so very fond of he. 
CHORUS.-Right fol tiddle liddle lol, right fol lol lol 
liddle diddle lay. 
So he jealous grew, as people say, 
Of a 
young soap-fat man, over the way; 
And because at him she threw sheep's eyes on, 
He run slap bang over to the corner drug store and 
bought him sixpenny worth of deadly pison. 
ClIORUS.-Right fol tiddle liddle 101, right fol lol lol 
liddle diddle lay. 
Some sheep's-head broth he made right quick, 
And put into it sixpenny worth of white ar-se-nic, 
And she supped at the soup as long as she was able, 
Then she fell flat stone dead right under a 
large 
mahogany table. 
Cnortus.—Right fol tiddle liddle lol, right fol lol lol 
liddle diddle lay. 
But to wicked William White, when he was asleep, 
There did appear the ghost of a 
sheep,

And unto him the ghost, it said— 
A 
gal you pisoned with my head. 
CHORUS.—Right fol tiddle liddle lol, right fol lol 101 
liddle diddle lay. 
Then they vanished off in a 
flash of lire, 
Which most of the neighborhood did very much 
admire, 
For they never seen the like before, 
And they didn't want for to see it any more. 
ClIORUS.—Right fol tiddle liddle lol right fol lol 101

MORAL. 
Young men don't pison your Jemima Green, 
For ne'er a

And falsehearted young gals ,
whenever you are 
sick, 
Think of William White, and his white arsenic.

The Uetired Physician. 
(Banjo Song.) 
By Unsworth. 
Now white folks listen unto my song, 
A 
lovely ditty I'll sin!-, for you, 
I'll sing it loud so you all can hear, 
And play it upon de banjo too. 
It's all about a 
retired physician, 
Whose sands of life had near run out; 
For the Sunday papers got down upon him, 
And his business all went up the spout. 
Oh! he wrote for Branch's Alligator, 
And paragraphs for the New York Tribune, 
He cured every ill in human nature, 
And made funny wood cuts for the Pickayune. 
He pulled out teeth for a 
shilling a 
dozen, 
Sold wooden legs made of Jersey bark, 
He was father-in-law to the four cent man, 
That sells enwollops round the Park. 
• 
28 
Unsworth's 
He made Brandreth's pills of castile soap, 
Which used to sell very well in a 
crowd. 
He inwented a 
cylinder escapement shower bath, 
Which used to make him feel so proud. 
But the Sunday Leader exposed him quite, 
And he'll have a 
speedy revenge he vows. 
So he's gone to Brooklyn out of spite, 
And opened an office for stump tailed cows. 
Good Evening, White Folk. 
(Local Banjo Song.) 
By Unsworth. 
GOOD evening, white folks, how do you do,

Oh l 
Blarney Castle. 
(Irish Comic Sang.) 
Sung by J. H. Collins. 
On Blarney Castle my &Arlin', 
Yer nothing at all but could sthone, 
Excipt an ould patch of ivy, 
That up your sides has grown. 
Oh it's once you wor strong and aincient, 
An' you kept all the Sassanachs down, 
In spite of the Lord Clancarty, 
That lived in swat° Dublin town. 
Bad cess to that villain ould Cromwell, 
And all his long batthering train, 
That rowled over here like a 
porpus, in 
Two or three hookers from Spain. 
An' beliase that he was a 
freemason, he 
Mounted a 
batthering ram, 
And he tilled it chock up wid gunpowther, 
That down in it's mouth he did cram. 
Thin it's one of de boy's of de castle, 
He looked over de battlement wall, 
There he saw that villain ould Cromwell, 
A 
feeding on powther an' ball. 
And the chap that married his dauther, 
With a 
great big grape shot in his jaw, 
Bould Iretown they called him, 
And he was his brother-in-law. 
Oh! dey fired their balls like tunder, 
An' they flew through the air like a 
snake, 
And they hit de high walls of the castle, 
That like a 
poor Curlew did shake. 
But de Irish had nothin' to tire, 
But their bows and their arrows, poor souls: 
Mighty bad tools for killing the Sassanaehs, 
But very good for killing wild chickens and 
fowls. 
Unsworth's 
Then it's one of the boys of the castle, 
lie picked up a 
Sassanach shot, 
Then he covered it up wid turf ashes, 
An' watched until it was red hot. 
Then he covered it up wid turf ashes, 
And trew it right over de wall. 
It would have burnt all dere tints into tinder, 
If it had happened on top of dem to fall. 
Then the castle it shook all over, 
Like you'll see an ould horse in July, 
When just on de tail of his crupper, 
lie's fazed wid a 
pesterhe fly. 
Then Cromwell he gave a 
dark signal, 
For in the black art he was deep, 
Though the eyes of the people were open, 
They soon found themselves all fast asleep. 
Wid his jack-boots he crossed on de water, 
And stepped right over the lake, 
And his sowljers they followed right after, 
As dry as a 
duck or a 
drake. 
To the Jeffries he then gave the castle, 
An' the lock on the rock closed they say, 
An' they kicked up the devil ever after, 
As his aunt-sisters do to this day. 
Queries. 
W ITT was Moses, when discovered by Pharaoh's 
daughter, like a 
buffalo hunter. 
Because he was a 
bull- rusher. 
When did Moses lie four in a 
bed ? 
When he slept wid his fore-fathers. 
Why does, or why should we suppose, a 
railway 
engineer understands punctuation well? 
Because he never puts a 
colon (coal on) when he 
wishes to come to a 
full stop. 
Walk Round, Stand the Storm.

The Groves of Blarney. 
Unsworth's Version. 
Oen, the Groves of Blarney, they look so charming, 
Down by the purling of swate silent brooks, 
All graced by posies that spontaneous grow there, 
All planted in order in their most beautiful rocky 
noo:ss. 
'Tis there's the daisy and the sweet carnation, 
The blooming p.nk and the rose so fair, 
Besides the lily, and that illegant dower some horti-
culturist call the daffy-Llown-dillv, 
All planted in order and stmAing up the most 
beautiful and salubrious morning air. 
'Tis Lady Jeffreys that commands this station, 
Like AlextunLr or like Helen fair, 
There's no commander in all the nation, 
For rigulation coald wid her compare. 
Such walls surround her, that divil a 
nine pounder, 
Could ever plunder her place of strength, 
Till Oliver Cromwell, the black muzzled ould villain 
he did her pummel, 
And made great breaches in her marble battle-
ments. 
An' there's a 
cave where no daylight inters, 
But cats and badgers are forever bred, 
All planted by nature, an' a 
dale complater 
Than a 
coach and six, or a 
long straw, six foot 
downy, feather bed. 
'Tis there's the lake well stored wid fishes, 
And the beautiful eels in the verdant mud, 
And the throat an' salmon, a 
sitting on their three 
legged stools, a 
playing a 
sociable and confi-
dential game of bac,igammon, 
But if you try to katch them, don't they cock up 
their tails to their noses, and swim so roman-
tically in order away. 
Burnt Cork Lyrics. 
There's statues gracing this noble mansion, 
All heathen gods and goddesses so fair, 
Bould Neptune, Plutarch, and Nickodemts, 
All standing together, whistling St. Patrick's day 
all in the open air. 
So now to finish my bould narration, 
Which my poor janius could not entwine, 
But were I 
Homer, or that grass ating thief ould 
Nebuchadnezzer, 
In every fatur I'd make it shine.

Why you can't tell that until it's hatched. 
The Dutch Barber. 
By linsworth. 
Now white folks listen a 
while, 
A 
story I 
will tell, 
Of an unfortunate little Dutch barber, 
Who in (his city did dwell. 
For he was of foreign extraction, 
And arrived in this city last fall, 
lie was made an American citizen 
Down at the City hall. 
Oh he opened a 
barber's shop, 
At 20 )0 
and 20 Broadway, 
And he soon got plenty of customers, 
But somehow they never would pay. 
36 
Unsworth's 
Oh! he fell in lub wid a 
young gal, 
Her name was Rachel Rebecca, 
Of a 
respectable Chatham street firm, 
And she papered up chewing tobacco. 
Oh! he bought his cigars from Rebecca, 
And always in hard cash he paid, 
But she run away one fine morning, 
With a 
Brooklyn dairy maid. 
Little Dutchy went crazy in consequence, 
And they shaved off his har just in time, 
And Frank Leslie's paper of yesterday, 
Says he's gone in the soap fat line. 
The Last Adieu. 
(A Ballad.) 
By J. H. Collins. 
CAN I 
forget the hour 
When first we fondly met? 
When the sun forgets the flow'r, 
Oh! then can I 
forget. 
When hearts have no emotion, 
Nor fond affection true, 
Then will die the deep emotion, 
Of my loved one's last adieu. 
'Twas on the golden sand, 
Where wave succeeded wave, 
Her bark that spurned the land, 
Flew o'er the surge so brave, 
We met, and there we parted ; 
Before the gale she flew, 
But, alas! I'm broken hearted, 
Since I 
breathed that last adieu. 
SHORT advice to people about to marry. 
Don't!

The Williamsburg Pieman. 
Composed by Unsworth. 
OH! across the river in Williamsburg, a 
pieman be 
did dwell, 
And his daughter Hangelina, of that town she was 
the belle, 
He used to drive round town in a 
handcart 
his mutton pies likewise mince, 
And the people said he made the worst pies 
They ever saw afore or since. 
Onortus of wind instruments. 
There was a 
ragman lived right on the next block, 
To Hangelina paid his distresses, 
And he used to make her Christmas presents 
Of nice second hand silk dresses. 
Whenever he wisited Hangelina, he had to keep 
still as a 
mouse, 
For her parients had wery politely forbid him to 
come near the house. 
CHORUS of ragamuffins. 
One Sunday the pieman at dinner-time was eating 
some pickled eeLs 
When he heard a 
noise in the chimbly, and he saw 
the ragman's heels. 
When the lovier seen the game was blocked 
He ran to Hangelina's room, 
And they poisoned themselves with Brooklyn swill 
milk, 
Which wai a 
terrible doom. 
CHORUS of stump tails. 
Oh! the pieman paid the newspapers to say, that 
his pies were the best around, 
Yet, strange to say, not a 
dog or a 
cat, could near 
his house be found.

Unsworth's 
But when he diskivered his daughter was dead, 
All the blame on himself he lies, 
And he doomed himself to a 
cruel death, 
By eating his own mutton pies.

By J.

Collins. 
On ! its meeting's a 
pleasure, and its parting's a 
grief, 
And an unconstant lovier is worse nor a

For the thief he will rob you, and just steal what 
you ha-aye, 
But an unconstant lovier will follow you to your 
grave. 
(Last two lines repeated in Chorus.) 
Oh, they'll buy you fine trinkets, fine garments and 
flowers. 
And they'll call in at tea-time to pay their devours. 
They'll swear that they love you by the light of the 
mune, 
And propose (marriage)—no, sherry cobbulars at 
Taylor's saloon. 
But when you are married, look out or your hub 
His evenings will spend at the odd-fellow's club. 
At the office or store he was kept, he'll pretend, 
And so he was too, drinking rum with a 
friend. 
Chorus.

Unsworth's 
But fortune's a 
false and fickle young jade, 
And it's worse than bad luck for to die an old

good-tempered wife.

Well what did she say? 
She said, don't.

Well, what did you do then? Why didn't you 
throw yourself at her feet, and exclaim: " Beloved 
Jemina, behold at your feet an ardent lover, who 
loves you to distraction; permit me to lead you to 
the altar, where by the light of hymen's torch, 
I 
shall be transformed from an ardent lover to a 
doting husband." (Imitates Johnson). 
No, sir, I

No,

BOYS (Fellow citizens I 
mane), Fellow citizens: 
I 
mane to say, that by giving your sup-
poort to McFinnigan, you will secure to yoursilves 
an ever dying wreath of odoriferous flowers of 
sublunary glory. 
An' whin the polls 
shall no 
longer remain, 
an' 
the 
glass 
ballot-boxes all 
smashed to smithereens, and your represintative 
is shakin' the American Sinate, wid the effulgence 
Unsworth's 
and earthquake-like terrors of his omnipotent elo-
quence. —Thin, 
in 
that 
glorious moment, en-
shroynded in the bosoms of yer woifes an' families, 
ye'll all turn round an' hug one another that you've 
chosen so magnificent and so efficient a 
ripresenta-
tive. 
Gintlemen, I 
repate it widout ripitition, a 
glory will accrue to ye, a 
glory like the tumbling 
avalanche, as the dolphin beautiful, and as the 
tnaarble delicious. 
You will see Mr. McFinnigan 
make himself a 
monumint out of the hearts of the 
people. 
He will be cloathed in the garmints of 
your good opinion, put his foot on the neck of cor-
ruption, and make a 
watch guard of the manacles 
of Freedom. 
Oh Dinah Dear. 
(kS'erenade.) 
Sung by J. IL Collins. 
Oii ! 
Dinah, dear, thy lover's near, 
Waiting for one smile from thee, 
The moon's fair light is flir less bright, 
Than is thy beauty, thy beauty, love, to me. 
The fairest flower in thy lubed bower, 
When compared wid thee, must fade. 
Then Dinah, dear, thy lover hear, 
While he sings lub's serenade. 
Dearest, awake, ere o'er the lake 
Beams the first blush ob coming day, 
Ere the first ray of coining day 
Bids thy fond lover, thy lover hence begone. 
Then do not chide, my own dear bride, 
Must my prayer in vain be made? 
l3ut Dinah, dear, thy lover hear, 
While thus he sings love's serenade. 
I 
know that my redeemer liveth, as the watch 
remarked to the Chatham street Pawnbroker.

Old Persimmons. 
(ffiesiss-ippi Boat Song.) 
By Unswo ,th. 
ON 
de Mississippi Riber, I 
used to cook de pork 
and beans, 
Chief cook aboard a 
steamboat dat run to New Or-
leans. 
I 
recomember well it was in de month of June, 
(SroKEN.— When de captain, old Persimmons was 
his sponsorial appellation, says) 
Darkies, take de banjo down, and gib de boys a 
tune. 
! 
I 
sot down on de capstan, and taked de banjo 
nice, 
An' ole sledge Sam did de essence like a 
mice. 
We used to call him sledge Sam, de reason am a 
fac, 
'Twas because he had an awkward way of turning 
up de Jack. 
De jinjincer was on de boiler deck, a 
sleeping away 
right smart, 
(SroKEN.—De jineneer's name was one-eyed Jo-
sephus, he lost de use of his mental faculties wid 
General Walker, in Nicaragua.) 
When he smelled de opposition bOat, her name it 
was de Dart. 
Oh, darkies, put de banjo up, and help to raise de 
steam, 
For I 
tell you now sure's you born, we'll be first in 
New Orleans. 
Den de captain grabbed his trumpet, and sung out 
wid might an' mane, 
We're bound to win dis race, boys, or neber run 
again, 
Burnt Cork Lyrics. 
So chuck in de rosin, boys, and make de fire burn, 
For de jinjineer's gone behind to gub her annuder 
turn. 
Den our ole boat started, de captain says all right, 
She run ober snags and all, an' kep ahead all nite. 
Oh de oder boat was no whar, her starn it was too 
heavy, 
An' six hours before de Dart, we landed on de levee. 
Wake up, Jeminah. 
(Local Banjo Song.) 
Composed and sung by Unsworth.

de Collins line of steamers was knocked down 
de oder day, 
So Cunard and Massa Vanderbilt hab it all dere

To bust up such a

But de lobby men at Washington must bar up all de 
blame.

Oh!

So they requested Manager Ullman to gib 'em some-

So he sent for the great Musard, all the way to

But he wouldn't come until he got his soap all in

An' to please you, here we will remain. 
Wove been rusticatin on de shelf, 
At Coney Island for our health. 
With rhyme and reason, 
We'll open de season, 
If de big bass fiddle will keep in tune. 
CHORUS.—De werry hot summer am gone and past, 
An' de telegraph cable am laid at last. 
Oh ! de cable am stretched from shore to shore, 
An' de good ship Niagara's here once more. 
To science and art things must yield, 
For nuffin can fail wid Cyrus Field. 
For I 
find on reflection, 
That widout his direction, 
That never a 
section of it had been laid. 
CHORUS.—De werry hot summer am gone and past, 
An' de telegraph cable am laid at last. 
New York has quite deserted grown, 
The codfish have vanished one by one.

The Opera's bust, and de legitimate drama, 
Has gone from our gaze like a

For novelty's the rage,

An' the rusty old fogies are all played out.

Forget Thee, Forget Thee, Thou Joy of 
my Soul! 
Written and sung by J. rt. Collins. 
FORGET thee, forget thee, thou joy of my soul! 
No, never, till I 
cease t..) be, 
For memory forever shall ONII thy control, 
And each thought be devoted to thee. 
For when I 
behold thee, thy beauty and truth, 
Free my soul from the world's sordid chain, 
And all the pure joys, and sweet dreams of my 
youth, 
Brightly gleam in this lone heart again. 
I 
languish, I 
languish, when thou art not near, 
Thou star of my soul's darkest night, 
What music the sound of thy footfall to hear, 
To meet thy fond gaze, what delight ! 
Come let me enfold thee to this faithful heart, 
Let thine eyes sweetly speak, I 
have loved not in 
vain, 
United for ever, no never to part, 
In darkness, in sunshine, in pleasure or pain.

The Dry Goods Clerk. 
(Banjo Song.) 
Composed and sung by Unsvrorth. 
THERE was a 
young man lived in Maneyunk town, 
Varmaceelli was his name, 
He got tired of living a 
country life, 
And he wasn't very much to blame. 
He emigrated down to this yah town, 
The fountain of all wealth, 
And he measured out tape in a 
dry goods store, 
Which wasn't very good for his health. 
Oh ! he fell in lub wid a 
sweet young dove, 
Her name it was Johanna, 
She wore a 
magnolious crinoline, 
And punished de grand piano. 
He used to take her to Taylor's saloon, 
And feed her on lemon ice cream. 
She was chief ingineer of a 
milliner's shop, 
And boss ob a 
sewing machine. 
Dere was a 
dogerrytype man libed opposite her 
house. 
And he tried her cruel heart for to soften, 
And he won her fond affeeshuns away, 
By taking her picture for noffin. 
When Varmaecelli came for to hear of this, 
lie was took with a 
very cold shiver, 
He tied an anchor round his neck for a 
life pre-
server, 
And he jumped right in de North River.

WnY is the American portion of the Atlantic ca-

Because it passed over the falls of the Niagara. 
She Wore a Wreath 
a of hoses. 
(Parody) 
By Collins. 
SHE eat twelve dozen oysters, 
At a 
stall when first we met, 
And pickled eels, and drank besides 
Six pots of heavy wet. 
Her figure had no lightness, 
Case it weighed full I 
wenty stone, 
A 
token that with the grub 
And gatter she'd been blown. 
I 
seed her but a 
moment, 
Yet methinks I 
see nets now, 
The pride she was of Five Points, 
And as drunk as Davy's sow. 
Six plates of beef and utters, 
When next we met she eat, 
The expressions that site used then, 
'Were far from being sweet. 
And standing by her side was one, 
Who strove, but all in vain, 
To get the money for the grab, 
She'd wolfed, he ne'er should see again. 
I 
seen her but a 
minute, 
Yet methinks I 
see her now, 
Lugged off by two policemen, 
For kicking up a 
row. 
MORAL. 
And wonee agen I 
sees that brow, 
No ringlets was there there, 
For she had got the prison crop, 
She'd been six mouths grinding air. 
She dwelt that time in solitude, 
But now once more she's free— 
She's joined a 
temperance s'iety, 
And means to live on tea. 
Unsworth's 
I 
seed her but a

Yet methinks I

With a

By Unsworth. 
Now all American citizens just listen unto me, 
For I'm a 
goin' to sing a 
song, as you can plainly 
see, 
It ain't about politics or such kind of capers, 
Nor noflin da.t you read about in all the Sunday 
papers. 
It's of a 
young culler'd man, his age was twenty-
nine, 
An' he drove a 
horse an' wagon in the soda water 
line. 
ho, my turtle dove, ha, ha, de lemon 
soda. 
Oh! he served de Dutch groceries, for they and he 
were thick. 
And he served the free lunch saloons, and never 
missed a 
trick. 
Oh, his mother was an artist an' used to- raffle tur-

kies, 
She was de first man that white-washed the Palace 
Garden Circus, 
But he couldn't make no money, not enough to 
tempt a 
greeny, 
Not half so much as the Herald gets for puffing 
Picollomini.

Says he, the surest way to wealth, is by the shortest 
cut, 
But his ambition met a 
check, like Bennett at Plum 
Gut. 
He bet his horse and waggon on the late prize 
fight, 
But he happened for to lose, which he didn't think 
was right, 
Oh! he took to gin and sugar, kase it used to tickle 
his throttle, 
And he hung himself with the copper wire of a 
London Porter Bottle.

Oh! Susannah—New Version. 
(Banjo S'.471 g.) 
Originally Written by J. H. Collins. 
I 
have recently arrived from an Alabamian locality. 
With the primitive Ethiopian musical instrument, 
generally known as 
the banjo, carefully 
placed and gracefully reclining on that por-
tion of the pedal extremities, most conven-
ient, when the human frame assumes a 
se-
dentary position. 
I 
am about to proceed in a 
southern direction, 
For the purpose of giving the beloved object of 
my veritable a&ction, a 
personal inspection. 
The pluvial emanations descended the whole 
of the evening, at the diurnal period of my 
departure, the terrestrial surface was totally 
deficient of moisture. 
I 
uttered a 
valedictory ejaculation and announced 
my intention of departure.

fully placed, and gracefully reclining on that 
portion of my anatomical development, gen-
erally known, styled or denominated, the Os 
Fsmorus, but in plainer language, better re-
cognized by the appellation of my knee. 
I had a 
noctural vision on a 
preceding evening. 
When no re-verberation, produced by con-
cussion was audible in the surrounding at-
mosphere. 
I 
perceived the personal resemblance of my Su-
sanhannah, descending the adjacent declivity 
in a 
circumnambular and rotary manner. 
The formation of fltrinaceous nutriment, was under-
going the process of mastication in her labial 
aperture. 
The lacrymal effusion issued from the gland, and 
overspread the cornea, produced by grief, 
was distinctly visible in her optical percep-
tion.

The City Beau. 
(Comic Song.) 
As Sung by Cool White. 
YOU'LL see a 
creature on the street, 
Most any sunny day, 
Who toats a 
little cane about, 
To keep the dogs away. 
He never hurries in his pace, 
But walks genteely slow, 
That all his graces may be seen, 
For he's the City Beau, 
That all his graces may be seen, 
For he's the City Beau. 
Cuoaus.—For he's the beau, for he's the beau, 
For he's the City Beau. 
His clothes are of the latest cast, 
And fit him like a 
skin, 
He promenades the Avenue, 
When working folks are in. 
And sometimes on his shoulder small, 
Just like an Esquimau, 
He hangs a 
blanket for a 
shawl, 
For he's the City Beau, 
He hangs a 
blanket for a 
shawl, 
For he's the City Beau. 
Cuoaus.—For he's the beau, for he's the beau, 
For he's the City Beau. 
He thinks the ladies dote on him, 
And fancies all the while, 
A 
snare in every glancing eye, 
A 
trap in every smile.

I 
SAY, Ginger, were you ever in love ? 
Well, I 
wasn't anything else, old hoss. 
Alt ! 
What kind of a 
ga' was she, Ginger ? 
Oh ! she was an elephant gal, highly polished. 
Yes indeed, her fader was a 
varnish maker, and 
what's better still, devoted to her Ginger. 
What do you mean by that ? 
She must have been 
a 
spicy gal. 
Ob course she was. 
That was de reason she was 
fond of Ginger. 
Do you know, Mr. Johnson, she 
was a 
poickess ? 
A poetess, you mean. 
Yes, I 
suppose so. 
She used to write verses for 
the Sunday papers, and the valentine shops, they 
used to call her blue stocking. 
Was that so ? 
No, indeed ; they was all white. 
Well, one day 
I 
went to the house ; my twilight was very elabo-
rate. 
In fact, I 
was dressed to kill. 
My hair was 
arranged a in negli, and my sur-lout 
ensemble 
fascinating in the extreme. 
Well, as soon as the 
gal saw me, she caved right in. 
She was a 
gone 
coon. 
When I 
left, she edged up to me, and whis-
pered in my ear, oh, Ginger, you're too sweet. 
Next day, I 
received a 
billet doux. 
How do you know it was a 
billet doux? 
Why because Billy Doo was de name ob de boy 
dat fetched it. 
It smelled all over like a 
doctor's 
shop, and had a 
green enwollop and a 
yellow seal.

LINES ADDRESSED TO GINGER. 
By Dinah Jalietta Beeswax. 
What love is, if you must be taught, 
Thy heart must teach alone, 
Two cabbages, wid but a 
single stalk, 
Two beets that are as one. 
Well, of course, you responded ? 
Yes, you see her father was a 
gardener, so I 
wrote what I 
calls wery appropriate. 
I 
calls it 
Wedgetable Poetry. 
LINES TO DINAH. 
Composed in a 
Kitchen Garden. 
Oh! you sweet and lubly Dinah, 
Than you der e 
can be nothing finer. 
Your tongue am sweeter dan a 
parrot's, 
Your hair hangs like a 
bunch ob carrots. 
Your turn-up nose, and den dose eyes, 
Golly, dey looks like two big gooseber-ries. 
And though of flattery I'm a 
hater, 
I 
lubs you better dan a 
sweet potater. 
Dat's what I 
call Wedgetable Poetry. 
So ap-
pealing it was to de gal's feelings, dat de next time 
I 
went dar, I 
found her dissolved in tears. 
What, weeping ? 
Yes, with tears in her eyes, and a 
big knife in 
her hand. 
She raised it as I 
approached. 
Rash girl I 
what was she about to do? 
Commit 
suicide ? 
No; she was peeling a 
lot ob big onions, to stuff 
a 
goose wid.

The Bonny Blue liandlcerehief. 
As I 
went a 
walking one morning in spring, 
To hear the birds whistle and the nigh tingals sing ; 
I 
spied a 
fair female who sweetly did sing, 
With her bonny blue hankerchief under her chin. 
Why wear you this handkerchief around you so tied, 
'Tis my country's fashion, kind sir, she replied; 
It's the fashion you know, sir, 1 
wish to be in, 
With my bonny blue handkerchief under my chin. 
This bonny blue handkerchief, my love gave me, 
lie told me it's colors they never would flee. 
And to him I'll prove true as the colors are in 
The bonny blue handkerchief under my chin. 
To kiss her sweet lips he was going to begin, 
Stop, sir, she replied, till I 
tell you one thing, 
lie that kisses those lips must produce a 
gold ring, 
With his bonny blue handkerchief under his chin. 
He put his hand in his pocket, pulled out a 
gold ring, 
Take this, my dear girl, will this one kiss win ? 
To you I've been true as the colors are in 
The bonny blue handkerchief under your chin.

(Banjo Song.) 
By Unsworth. 
OH! here I 
am, Ise gwan to sing, 
Ise gwan to gib you something new. 
I'll sing you now a 
sad refrain, 
And play it on de banjo too. 
It's of a 
high-strung southern belle, 
She lived with her parients in Mobile, 
But into sorrow they have fell, 
For the New York lawyers made 'em squeal. 
Burnt Cork Lyrics. 
One moonlight night, all was serene, 
When a 
knock was heard on the kurnel's door, 
An' in did walk a 
French sardine, 
An' they showed him up to de basement floor. 
De kurnel's lady, she was up stairs, 
Reclining on her couch to rest, 
When she heard of Count Sebastopol Mulliga-
tawney de Reviere, 
The Emperor Napoleon's inwited guest. 
De count made lub to de kurnel's daughter, 
An' persuaded her to run away; 
But de cruel parient, bent on slaughter, 
Collared dem both right in Broadway. 
Oh! he took her back to the sunny south, 
And de papers say he treats her kind; 
But de galliant capting looks down in de mouth, 
So he lectures on love to ease his mind.

The Jersey Fisherman. 
(Banjo Song.) 
By Unsworth. 
DOWN near the Battery, 
A 
young gal used to dwell, 
Her father kept an oyster stand, 
And sold 'em on the shell. 
Burnt Cork Lyrics. 
63 
Her mother she sold shaving soap, 
For renovating coats; 
But the gal sold sour apples 
On the Fulton ferry boats. 
There was a 
Jersey fisherman, 
his name it was Mr. Crank, 
lie used to dig for muscles 
On the Coney Island banks. 
He fell in love with this young gal, 
Before that he did know her, 
From seeing her picter painted 
On an omnibuses door. 
He took her to Staten Island, 
Where the sogers sleep in tents, 
And her cruel heart was konkered 
By the Dutch regiments. 
Come shange de rings mi,t me, my tear, 
A Dutchman he did say, 
lie mashed his drum on de fisherman's head, 
An' they both did run away. 
Now all you Jersey musclemen, 
What ever you may do, 
Don't go near the oyster gals, 
Or they'll get you in a 
stew. 
Hail Columbia up in de garret, 
Yankee doodle shouta, 
By an' by de policeman, 
He can nix fetch hint outa. 
Irish Ballad. 
SURE it's ait phin ye're hungry, 
An' dhrink phin ye're dry, 
If we've very good luck, sure 
We'll live till we die. 
Unsworth's 
Stay home wid your mudder, 
You'll find it no loss, 
For a 
sthone that kapes rolling 
Will gather no moss. 
Sure the purty young sparrows, 
They live widout harrows, 
No ploughs or wheelbarrows 
Have they to annoy. 
No diggin' or flusterin', 
Durty industherin', 
No windy blustherin' 
Hindhers their joy. 
Faix, the ducks an' the drakes, 
They likes rainy wedder, 
They'd sooner go intel 
The water than fly. 
Figs an' turkeys togedher, 
They don't wet a 
feddher, 
But sthand underneath 
The ould shed till it's dhry. 
The Jolly Beggar. 
(Old Scotch Song.) 
THERE was a 
jolly beggar, 
An' a 
beggar he was boun, 
An' he tak't up his lodgiu' 
In a 
barn ayent the toun. 
CHORIIS.—Sae we'll gang na, mair a 
roving, 
A 
roving in the nicht, 
We'll gang na mair a 
roving 
Let the moon shine e'er sae bright, 
Sae we'll gang na mair a 
roving. 
He wad na lie in barn, 
Nor wad he lie in byre,

Let the moon shine e'er sae bright, 
Sae we'll gang na mair a

The gudeman's dochter she gat up, 
A' for tel bar the door, 
When there she spied the beggarman 
A

He put his horn richt tel his lips, 
An' blaw baith loud an' shrill, 
An' four an' twenty belted knights 
Cam louping o'er the hill.

Larry Mac hale. 
BOULD Larry McHale had nothin' to fear, 
For he always had plenty phin the crops didn't 
fail, 
He'd a 
house, and a 
farm, an' a 
hundre a 
year, 
And a 
heart for to spend it had Larry Meliale. 
He's the joy of a 
party, the soul of a 
feast, 
An iligant song he could sing, I'll go bail, 
He would fight wid the parson, or dhrink wid the 
priest, 
Och, the divil's own boy was bould Larry McHale. 
How little he cared for the judge or recorder, 
For his house it was big an' sthrong as a 
jail, 
Wid a 
cruel four pounder he kep' things in order, 
Och he'd murder the county would Lary McHale. 
He'd a 
blunderbuss too, of horse pistils, a 
pair, 
But his favorite weapon was always the flail, 
Och if you could see how he'd itnty a 
fair, 
For he handled it nately did Larry MeiTale. 
His ancestors were kings before Moses was born, 
his mother decinded from Teddy O'Neal, 
He could laugh at the blinks of the Frinch all to 
scorn, 
They are mushiroons compared to bould Larry 
Merrale. 
Ile sits down every day to a 
plintyful dinner, 
With uncles an' cousins enough for a 
tale, 
Although loaded with debts yet 'liver a 
sinner, 
Could ere sarve a 
process on Larry Archaic. 
With a 
larder well stocked an' a 
plentiful board, 
Sure none lived so well from Fairhead to Kinsale, 
As he piously said I've a 
bountiful store, 
And dame fortune is kind to poor Larry Mella.le. 
So fill up your glasses, a 
stout bumper give him, 
How little we care for the tithes or repale, 
Sure ould Ireland would be a 
fine country to live in, 
If we only had plenty like Larry MclIale.

Teddy O'Neal. 
(Irish Ballad.) 
As sung by T. B. Prendergast, 472 Broadway. 
I'VE come to the cabin he danced his wild jig in, 
As nate a 
mud palace as ever was seen, 
Cousidering it sarved to keep poultry and pigs in, 
I'm sure it was always most iligant cane. 
But now all about it seems lonely and dreary, 
Sad, and all lonely, no piper, no reel, 
Not even the sun through the casement is cheery, 
Since I 
lost that dear darlint boy, Teddy O'Neal, 
SilIce I 
lost that dear darlint boy, Teddy O'Neal. 
I 
dreamt but last night, an' bad luck to my dream-
ing, 
I'd die if I 
thought it was surely to pass— 
I dreamt, while my tears down the pillow was 
streaming, 
That Teddy was coorting another fair lass. 
Och! didn't I 
wake with weeping and wailing, 
The thought of the grief was too deep to con-
ceal, 
My mother cries, Norah, child what is your ailing ? 
But all I 
could utter was Teddy O'Neal, 
But all I 
could utter was Teddy O'Neal. 
I'll never forget when the big ship was ready, 
And the moment had come for my love to de-
part, 
I 
cried like a 
spalpeen, good bye to you, Teddy, 
Willi drops on my cheek, an' a 
stone at my 
heart. 
Says he, ' tis to better my fortune I'm roaming, 
But what would be gold to the joy I 
should feel, 
If he only comes back to me honest an' loving, 
Still poor, but my own darling Teddy O'Neal, 
Still poor, but my own darling Teddy O'Neal.

Professor Unswortles Celebrated Lecture 
on the Atlantic Telegraph Cable. 
PROPERTIES— Table with diagrams and models. 
FELLOW CITIZENS AND CITIZEI•IISES 
hab been waited upon by a deputation 
from Hoboken, requestin' dat I 
shall lueidate de 
subject ob de great Atlantic Telegraphic Cable. 
Convalescent to their unmitigated acclamations, I 
will now shew forth my affidavit. 
De Telegraph Cable was laid for de purpose ob 
proving de fluency oh intermittent correspondence. 
Dar am free kinds ob correspondence: In de fag 
place dar am de written correspondence, which goes 
through de post-office in de form ob a 
letter, pro-
vidin' it don't say money letter on de back— in dat 
case, it stays dar. 
Secondly, dar am de newspaper 
correspondence, fellow citizens; 
and dar am a 
great many ob de population hab meddled wid 
newspaper correspondence; some hab been paid 
in specie for dar ' Iutninations, while udders hab 
been sent on de island. 
Thirdly, and lastly, we 
hab de great and glorious Atlantic telegraphic, gal. 
va.nic, moreantique, submarinetic cable correspon-
dence, de wonder ob de age, which was laid by de 
'Merican Eagle, las July, in spite oh de equinoxial 
benebolences, an' has united in de bonds ob hem-
lock England and America. 
Whar was dere eber 
seen such a 
happy marriage? 
Neither ob them 
had a 
word in two months. 
But who's fault am it 
dat de cable don't work, dot am de question? 
Don't we make walking canes ob it? 
Don't we 
hang it on our watch chains ? 
Don't we gib torch 
processions in honor ob it? 
Didn't we burn down 
de City Hall for it ? 
Den, fellow citizens, who can say dat we don't do 
ebervthing in our power to frustrate de great and 
glorious work. 
De mistake am in de sheenery, an' 
I'll shew you what's de matter wid him. De machine 
70 
Unsworth's 
de 'lectricians hab at present to produce de cir-
culation ob de blood in de cable, am null and woid. 
If, thercfore, fellow citizens, dey wish de pulse ob 
de cable to opperate, dey must put Cyrus Field in 
de hospital, an' send for me, No. 2 
Huckleberry 
abenue, next door to de poorhouse. 
Dis little 
arrangement, which you will perceibe here on my 
right, am a model ob my patent inwention for 
working de cable. 
Wid it I 
can produce conges-
tion ob de organs in fourteen minutes. 
Here am 
de investigator, and here de upheramby, here am 
de currieulium, an' dars de refrigerator. 
Any lady 
or gentleman casting dere optical delusion on dis 
galvanic reflector, will immediately perceive de vi-
bration ob de electric currant—dey must look wery 
sharp, though, in order to perceive it, case we 
can't afford to turn de gas down, as de gas bill am 
too high dis week. 
I 
will now proceed to gib you 
an illustration ob de way dat I 
propose to transmit 
a 
message to Walentia Bay, and znisa teerser. 
Many 
ob de citizens here present would imagine dat dis 
am a common tin plate, but it aint. 
It's a 
whole 
galwanic battery. 
In order to produce a 
transmission of de currant, 
I 
first, as you perceibe, rewolve de curriculium, wid 
a 
reNvolving movement—dat produces de extension 
ob de fibres, thus. 
Den, by agitating dis commu-
nicator, we hab de opherarnby. 
Dar you hab it, 
clar as mud. 
(Business.) 
By habing dis candle lit, so we save sixpence a 
night for lumination, I 
can produce ice cream in 
four minutes, and nobody under de table. 
Country 
orders attended to wid weekly dispatch. 
Now den, ladies and gentlemen, habing shown 
you de triumph ob my apparatus, I 
will now take a 
forty horse- power shock ob lectricity, jes to show 
you de 'feet galbanism has upon de human system. 
[Explosion, and Business general bust up.

Good Bye, Sweetheart, Good Bye. 
By J. L. Hatton. 
THE bright stars fade, the morn is breaking, 
The dewdrops pearl each bud and leaf, 
And I 
from thee my leave am taking, 
With bliss too brief, with bliss, with bliss too 
brief. 
How sinks my heart with fond alarms, 
The tear is hiding in mine eye, 
For time doth thrust me from thine arms, 
Good bye, sweetheart, good bye; 
For time doth thrust me from thine arms, 
Good bye, sweetheart, good bye. 
The sun is up, the lark is soaring, 
Loud swells the song of chanticleer, 
The levret bounds o'er earth's soft flooring, 
Yet I 
am here, yet I 
am here. 
For since night's gems from heaven did fade, 
And morn to floral lips doth hie, 
I 
could not leave thee though I 
said 
Good bye, sweetheart, good bye; 
Good bye, sweetheart, good bye; 
I 
could not leave thee though I 
said 
Good bye, sweetheart, good bye.
