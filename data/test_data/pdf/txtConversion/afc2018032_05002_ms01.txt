Introductions 
0.00.30 
From DeForest; family moved around to several places. Went to college in 
Platteville for a year. Worked for an insurance company. Later went to school or 
occupational therapy, while working four jobs. Worked as occupational therapy 
assistant for 10 years. At the time, Winnebago was short of nurses, and offering 
money for CNAs return to school. Graduated and switched over to nursing and 
have been nursing 10 years. At first, was nurse on the floor with criminal 
population. After being beaten up twice, and having to have neck fused, moved to 
utilization review role. 
0.02.50 
When young, “the blood and guts, that wasn’t my thing at all. But nursing here 
isn’t like that at all—there is some blood and guts—but there’s no surgeries that 
happen here. We do a lot of observation, documentation. My old unit, because it 
was forensic, we were kind of the eyes and ears for the doctors to say, ‘They are 
competent to stand trial.’ And I liked that aspect of it.” 
0.03.59 
At Platteville, first went to school to be phys. ed. teacher. This originated from an 
inspirational gym teacher at high school and enjoying looking after younger kids 
in sports activities at school. Lived in Madison for two years while working for 
insurance company, but “I’m not Madison type” (in the apartment, had to have 
music on all the time because there was gunshots) and moved back to Cambria 
area.  
0.06.02 
Prompted to return to school because degree could be financed by employer, and 
nurses make a lot more money than occupational therapy assistant. But a much 
more rigorous—and set—schedule as a nurse. When started as nurse, already had 
ten years seniority, so “wasn’t at the bottom of the barrel.” 
0.07.42 
The financing of degree was because of nursing shortage at the time. “Due to 
patient violence—the acuity of the patients—I think they were just trying to staff 
more so people wouldn’t leave, wouldn’t get hurt.” 
0.08.27 
Some people content not to return to school, but for those who wanted career 
advancement, made sense to take the opportunity. Was open to go to any nursing 
program had 16 hours a week, with work the rest of the time. But there were 
Page 2 of 7 
 
enforceable hours while on this program: you could get called back to work at 
almost any time. 
0.09.48 
Found time pressure a challenge, with commute family, work, and study 
commitments. “Driving down the highway to and from school in the daylight, I 
had notecards … You just learn to multitask.” On a family trip to south Dakota 
before Boards, took backpack with books and notes; felt that didn’t want to waste 
2.5 years of work. 
0.11.36 
Core classroom was all with same group of students, with different clinical 
breakouts.  
0.12.04 
“Everybody wanted to be baby nurses—three quarters of the class. I was like, 
‘This doesn’t interest me at all.’ Some wanted to do ICU type stuff, but I would 
say the majority were baby ones. I was like, ‘Ugh.’” Part of the scheme was that 
you had to stay at Winnebago for a period of time after completing the 
coursework. Interviewee always wanted to work there for 30 years.  
0.13.24 
On mentoring: did not feel that anyone played a mentoring role. “In fact, I really 
had a hard time with my mental health teacher.” Felt targeted because of having 
credits needed not to have to take class and only do clinicals; felt this person did 
not appreciate real-life nursing care. “That’s probably my strongest memory of 
nursing school, that woman.” 
0.14.54 
On nurses not in mental health: “Because mental health scares people. And when 
you hear people getting beaten up, or what the TV portrays those people as. And 
we do get some horrible people. But we also get people who we do wonderful 
things for.” Example: one young man with schizophrenia early in career ended up 
getting a job making more than interviewee; parents sent a check to allow clinic to 
do more activities with patients, in appreciation. 
0.16.17 
Finds working with children, especially those with birth conditions, very sad. And 
feels pressure of restrictions being a “middleman” kind of clinic. Finds it amazing 
how resilient some young people are. 
0.16.58 
On media portrayals: “I think a lot of it goes back to One Flew Over The 
Cuckoo’s Nest and The Shining … I think TV shows now are putting more of 
bipolar, depression out there … I just think more people are aware that if you 
have a lot of ups and downs, you might need a little something.” 
0.17.51 
Feels that changes have happened over several years, and the advent of advocacy 
groups. Feels this is related to transgender activism, and people shunned or picked 
on because of their gender identity, and that rates of mental illness among these 
people can be higher. Feels that families can be less supportive of these people 
than friends. 
0.19.18 
Used to be a floor devoted to kids, but because of state legislation changes, 
children are “emergency detained”, results in a non-verbal adolescent in with a 
drug-addicted kid. “How do you think that’s going to go? They’re going to get 
bullied.” One unit was long-term behavioral, with families involved, developing 
reward programs continued at home. But this not done any more—“we’re 
considered acute mental health, and that’s not acute … and no one wants to pay 
for that. And there’s three-month waiting lists. What are you going to do to fix 
it?” Feels that this degradation of care is one of the big changes that interviewee 
has seen over years.

0.21.05 
On Winnebago’s: can’t voluntarily commit oneself; population made up of people 
from across state; sometimes from police-involved incidents, where emergency 
detention process is started; after court review and assessments from two 
independent doctors (and possible emergency 14-day detention), decision made 
on whether to admit patient to hospital. Different commitment lengths, depending 
on details of how these processes go. Also, population includes people found not 
guilty by reason of mental defect, with different lengths of stay depending on 
length of sentence and whether parole is given (partly determined by assessments 
made in hospital). Mendota—the sister facility of Winnebago—doesn’t take 
female patients, so Winnebago takes many of these patients, or people transferred 
from a prison for mental health issues or new charges brought while in prison 
where a competency questions has arisen. 
0.24.55 
On ‘treating to competency’: these patients meet with social workers and 
psychologists, learning about their situation, their plea options, and a doctor 
decides whether they are psychologically stable. After a year in this status, a 
determination made whether they are competent to help in their defense. If not 
competent, charges ‘disappear;’ typically, this is followed by a civil commitment 
process. 
0.26.49 
“And this is an interesting time of year. You’ll see the numbers, because they’re 
hungry, they’re cold, they commit crimes because they need housing … You see 
an influx in the criminal admissions.” 
0.27.17 
On the relationships and teamwork between the different groups involved: “The 
CNAs—we call them PCTs here—they are really the eyes and ears. They’re out 
on the unit, 24/7. They come to the nurse and say, ‘So-and-so isn’t doing well. 
They’re responding to internal stimuli, etc.’ The nurse then makes an assessment 
and suggests different options to doctor. A lot of collaboration. “The doctors put a 
lot of trust in the nurses here—the psychologists are pretty Monday to Friday. 
Doctors are on call for admissions, but not here all the time. The nurses pretty 
much run the unit.” A large meeting held every week, running through the 
patients on each unit, reporting and deciding on changes in treat plans. Also, a 
treatment team meeting in mornings. Plans decided on ‘what needs to happen for 
this person to leave’—a variety of possible goals. Group facilitators on this basis 
decide which groups will be most beneficial for this patient. Some units do more 
team meetings than others—this depends on the staff. Some units more cohesive 
than others. Interviewee primarily deals with kids. Everyone very interested in 
patients. 
0.31.03 
On lack of cohesion at times: “Some units, you have people who don’t really 
enforce the rules. And we’re not behavioral treatment anymore—we used to be. 
Our unit guidelines—it’s not rules—but there’s certain things that can’t happen. 
It’s a safety thing … But maybe now you don’t get your snack tonight because 
you misbehaved. And some staff will be like, ‘I don’t care. I don’t want problems 
from you. Take it.’ But then the next day when the same thing happens—so there 
can be staff splitting in that way.” 
0.32.21 
A lot of staff turnover: the PCTs were ‘forced’ four to five days. That makes 
people tired and bitter. With a new training regime, people’s schedules have been 
more trammeled, with more mandatory overtime. “And people just left—they’d 
Page 4 of 7 
 
had it … Burned out. Because we couldn’t split. We always used to. If you got 
forced, you could say, ‘Hey, would you take the second half of my overtime?’ and 
then you couldn’t be forced because you’d worked for 12 hours.” When this 
scheme ended, this played a large role in nurses leaving. 
0.34.08 
‘Forcing’ is being required to play the whole next shift. Could happen for a 
variety of reasons: absences, or nurses out hurt, or people on vacation. Sometimes 
could know in advance, but when ‘trading’ scheme ended, this just left people to 
“stew” even when they knew in advance. Feel that this was especially hard on 
PCTs. Recent batches of nurses have left after a short time. Interviewee has 
trained recent incoming nurses, and this limits time on the unit. 
0.36.02 
Used to take notes on paper, handwritten, with occasional dictation from doctor. 
Med administration was on paper. Transition to an electronic system has been 
difficult, and system doesn’t work exactly as intended. Has also frustrated 
doctors, who had relied on nurses to do a lot of work, and who had limited 
training in new system. Nurses only have access to certain parts, and so have to 
refer more work to doctors. This institution was first to ‘go live’ of five agencies 
(i.e., the five or six DHS agencies), because of most diversity in institution. Feels 
that this has placed the institution in the role of a ‘test dummy.’ 
0.39.59 
On early experiences in Winnebago: “The grounds, I was amazed, there was not a 
fence all around it. Back in the day, the patients could smoke. I pulled up for my 
interview, and was like, ‘Who’s a patient? Who’s staff?’ … So that was weird. 
And I backed out of the interview a couple of times, I’d had mental health 
experience, but we rode the bus and ate cucumber sandwiches, we didn’t do a 
whole lot.” Initially didn’t have a whole lot of interaction with serious mental 
health issues. The week before interviewee’s wedding, took group of patients—
including old woman who had lobotomy—for a walk. And this woman, who 
didn’t like having anything drawn, “came swinging at me,” thinking interviewee 
was going to take her blood. “And I was like, ‘What on earth?’” 
0.42.00 
On the physical space of the hospital: This has changed significantly. When 
interviewee started in 1995, had 300 patients. A new hall was built. Now average 
census is about 170. Community reintegration has resulted in this downsizing. 
Used to be a group home building, with patients cooking for themselves and 
passed their own meds. There was staff there, and they would step down. But “no 
one wants to pay $1000 a day” for that kind of care, so closed down. Many units 
have merged or been reduced. “The whole behavior [modification] thing kind of 
went to the side of the road, and we don’t have that anymore.” 
0.44.07 
On the changes for nurses’ role: Nurses worked closely with PCTs to educate on 
the patient’s program, e.g., knowing how many contacts a day that patients would 
need to get a ‘token’. In the ‘medical model,’ on the other hand, still has a 
psychosocial component, but without the ‘consequence.’ Many more patients now 
come for shorter periods—a week—and don’t end up on meds; the question is 
whether counselling and groups will help instead. 
0.45.25 
Nurses no longer do some many groups, because of increased workload 
elsewhere. The group facilitator checks in before and after group activities with 
nurse, to update on patient’s progress.

0.46.10 
On returning to Winnebago after being at school: A different clientele, from kids 
to the criminally insane. “And just kind of being in charge. You know, the nurses 
are in charge of the unit, really. There’s a unit director, but they’re in meetings. 
So, huh, I was in charge. There’s PCTs who need to know what to do. The joke is 
my name is still on the binder, ‘You can only be on the phone for 10 minutes.’ 
They still say, ‘Get them off the phone’ [because of interviewee’s insistence on 
this]. It’s a rule!’” Another big change was deciding when to use restraints on 
patients, and the supervision of other workers. 
0.48.32 
An example: One patient just walked up and down the hall, talking to himself. 
Another patient was upset with this patient, and when interviewee intervened, 
“the riot started.” Interviewee pushed button to call other staff, to return patients 
to rooms. Because it was a weekend, “you just didn’t have the extra staff.” 
Interviewee felt overwhelmed. One nurse drew up shots. The patient whose 
behavior had started the incident couldn’t be found—had hidden in the seclusion 
room, knowing that patients were “coming for him.”  
0.51.11 
“When things go bad with the mentally bad, they go bad very quickly.” Has found 
that environmental changes have helped—changing furniture, staff wearing 
shatterproof glasses, etc. “But where there’s a will, there’s a way.” 
0.51.35 
On suffering injuries at work: One patient often took excessively long showers, 
turned up late for coffee. He was “getting in PCT’s face,” and nursing station is 
three sides of glass, and demanding coffee after coffee hour was over. Patient 
“just started swinging,” and one nurse suffered a concussion. Interviewee doesn’t 
remember being hit but had to go to doctor and had neck problems. On return to 
work two weeks later, another difficult patient had discovered that putting his 
back against the wall interfered with staff efforts to ‘take patient down.’ 
Interviewee was still not taking patient contact, because couldn’t turn neck, but 
when trying to give patient shot, “there was a pop.” “And I just tapped out—and I 
was just getting back to work.” Interviewee had delays in medical treatment, and 
treatment ultimately took a year. At this point, decided was done with patient 
contact. Another nurse several weeks later had to have cement anchors in 
shoulder, after a bad injury inflicted by a patient. This nurse also had to leave 
because couldn’t be replaced, and ultimately was let go. Interviewee finds this 
atrocious, especially because roles are sometimes ‘created’ for more senior staff, 
even though these people are not injured while in patient contact.  
0.56.15 
Interviewee is now an incident support staff. Some staff will have “life that is 
never going to be the same;” one gets around with a wheel walker. Interviewee 
herself has 15% disability. “This job just sucks that way.” 
0.57.40 
Minor injury incidents happen frequently, and some people are “right on the 
edge”. “It just depends—the unit the male nurse got hurt on is the long-term unit 
where things happen infrequently. Knees and backs are more the thing, because 
that happens doing the takedown … It doesn’t happen very often, but really bad 
stuff happens, and people are just like, ‘I don’t need this.’” 
0.58.33 
Training in nursing school doesn’t cover this kind of physical interaction with 
patients; in nursing school, this is not covered; instead you get “trained for 
everything”. Interviewee finds this strange. 
Page 6 of 7 
 
0.59.10 
Protocol for ‘take downs’: Typically, six people are desired, but in some 
interactions, if another patient is threatened, it has to happen with fewer people. 
There has more recently been ‘refresher’ training as techniques have changed and 
studies show that there’s a better way of doing it. Similarly, suicide assessment 
process has changed over the years. 
1.00.12 
“I think it’s stressful in a different way [the nursing job in this institution].” 
1.00.35 
On dealing with the stress: “Ideally, there’s supposed to be a debriefing after a 
stressful situation. I can say that I’ve seen that about five times in 23 years. I can 
say that a lot of it is going out after work … There are certain establishments in 
the area that are Winnebago-based.” Largely dealt with through informal off-
campus conversation. A string of informal mechanisms when staff realize that 
someone has had a particularly stressful encounter. There’s an employee 
assistance mechanism that occasionally is activated for serious incidents 
(therapists are made available to talk), “but I don’t think too many people took 
advantage of it.” “The belief is, if management is in there, if there’s going to be 
an investigation, they worry about saying something that will be used against 
them. We’ve had deaths. It happens. But people get very angry against 
management because they get targeted … They want to find someone responsible, 
and sometimes there’s no one responsible.” 
1.03.20 
On the differences between mental health nursing and other kinds of nursing: 
“Well, first off, general hospital, surgical, no comparison. You don’t have the 
patient interaction. If you’re the OR nurse, the patient comes in, unconscious 
within minutes. And some people love that for that reason. So that’s very much a 
medical type model; they’re in and out and moving on. I think in a lot of ways 
mental health nurse like being a clinic nurse, because of that psychosocial 
component. You learn a lot by talking to someone. And watching my daughter 
when we went to the hospital, the nurse really tries to pull stuff out of her without 
her knowing. And there’s a lot that here.” Feels that more of a rehab-type 
atmosphere. “Mental health impacts everything, whereas the medical nursing 
doesn’t come back this way.” 
1.05.20 
“[In any kind of facility] mental health involved. You just had heart surgery, but 
how are you doing with it? Will you have pain? How will you deal with it? … In 
everything, there’s a huge mental component.” 
1.06.06 
On what keeps interviewee in stressful job: Loves cases where “you feel like you 
made a difference”. One patient sent his graduation card; made a big impact on 
interviewee. Loves coworkers, feels that can help others with training; hopes she 
is perceived as someone who’s knowledgeable and helpful. “We’ve had lots of 
management changes over the year, but the camaraderie on the unit is top-notch.” 
And that essential to keeping patients safe: “if you don’t like or trust who you’re 
working with, this not the place for you to be.” 
1.07.27 
Some people who don’t feel connected, don’t feel listened to, decide to quit. One 
former coworker said, “I cry myself to work every day.” Others don’t have the 
right attitude to patient care, saying, “I can’t wait to fight with the patients.” Some 
units in particular “seem to eat their young. They have some seasoned nursing 
staff, and if they like you, they like you; if they don’t, they don’t.” Interviewee 
Page 7 of 7 
 
finds this puzzling: when people leave in these situations, everyone else gets 
‘forced’ more. 
1.09.17 
On training new nurses: Interviewee focuses on policy and procedure, but alerts 
incoming staff that some people will not get on well or might be referred to the 
supervisor by a PCT. “The nurse may run the unit in concept, but it’s the PCTs, 
you know, specific ones.” Example: one young incoming patient was covered in 
vomit and wouldn’t do anything. Interviewee and another young staff member sat 
for three hours picking out vomit from patient’s hair, but eventually had patient’s 
hair shaved. Another staff member was appalled by this, feeling that interviewee 
had not understood cultural significance of patient’s hair. But interviewee felt that 
coworker had not understood the effort she had put into cleaning hair and that had 
devoted half a shift to it and had other things to do.  
1.12.21 
Feels that people who haven’t worked in mental health sometimes “just don’t get 
it”.  
1.13.04 
On the role of a mental health nurse: “I think mental health nursing is there to 
help people help themselves, whether it’s building up their self-esteem, helping 
them get on medication that helps them to function. So many of our patients it’s 
that depression, bipolar stuff. Helping them to realize that they have potential … 
and why it’s so important to get the patient invested in their treatment or rehab. 
And all nursing is patient-centered, but it’s different, I think, than medical—
medical, it’s ‘Here’s a pill, your heart’s going to be fine, take this.’ And people 
don’t like to think that their mind isn’t at its peak, so to speak.” 
1.14.33 
“Or you have the manics who want to stay manic because having wild sex and 
being carefree is awesome. And they don’t want to slow down. So, the education, 
getting them on board, can be difficult.” One patient charged a $600 phone call 
from the institution to the Pope. “But those are happy stories.”
