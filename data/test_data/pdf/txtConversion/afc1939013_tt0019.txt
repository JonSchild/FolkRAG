English
The Mouse and the Cat
by Dalia Soto
A little mouse was hungry And a crumb he went out to find But the little cat who was
awaiting Didn't even let him take a step. The little mouse by another side A new exit at
last he found And he went very far, While the cat running and running In the back of him
stayed.
