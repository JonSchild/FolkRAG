Summary.  Renee Pupura is a resident of Seldovia Alaska.  She was born in 1958 and has been a 
lifelong resident of the Kachemak Bay region of Lower Cook Inlet in Southcentral Alaska.  Renee grew 
up in the community of Homer, Alaska, and moved to the south side of Kachemak Bay and off the road 
system in the late 1970s.  Renee and her late husband Robert lived life afloat, living on a small house 
boat and set netting for salmon in Kachemak Bay.  Central themes to Renee’s oral history, are her 
relationship with her late husband Robert, the off the grid small boat fishing lifestyle they shared, and 
building community with a small group of fishermen and boat builders living in the area She still lives in 
Seldovia, Aaska.

Hello, my name is Josh Wisniewski and this is Beyond the Breakwater in oral history project, dedicated 
to recording and celebrating the life histories, stories, and knowledge of rural Alaska skiff fishermen and 
residents of rural coastal Alaska. And the purpose of it is to document and share the stories of the 
coastal lifestyle and Skiff fishing as a way of life here in Alaska, and today is November 20 2021. And 
I'm here with Rene Pereira, who we're talking with today, as well as with Marissa Wilson. Renee is a 
lifelong resident of Kachemak Bay, a commercial salmon settlement, Fisher fisherman, and we are 
meeting today in Rene's home here in Soviet Alaska. And also, with us today is Cyrano of Seldovia. 
and Bella Luna. Rene’s lovely little dogs. So, Renee, thank you for having us today. I am super excited 
to get to do this interview with you. 
 
Renee: It's a pleasure 
 
Josh:  So I'm just going to start by asking you a couple basic questions. And then I'm hoping you'll just 
lead the conversation. And maybe I'll just provide some, a little bit of structure for it. I'm just going to 
start by asking you what year you were born. 
 
Renee  01:23 
So I was born in 1958 in Homer, Alaska, and grew up there as well. I was one of the first few children 
born in Homer rather than Seldovia. Because my brother Guy was born here in Seldovia, in 1956, 
because there was no clinics or doctor in Homer at the time until I came along. So and there if if you

talk to a lot of people that were brought up here, back during that time, even folks as far away as 
Seward, some of them came, and were born here in Seldovia, as well, because Seldovia was the hub. 
It was the largest town and freight came through here and mail came through here. And Homer was not 
a very big town at the time. 
 
Josh Wisniewski  02:27 
Nice. i So were you born in a hospital? Or did they have a clinic or something at that point in time? 
 
Renee  02:33 
Yeah, it was a small like two bed clinic in Homer, and I believe the building is still there up. Bartlett 
Street, close to where the large hospital is. South Peninsula hospital today. 
 
Josh Wisniewski  02:54 
Well, so as one of the first Homer born children, I guess my follow up question for you is like, what was 
what was Homer like then when you were growing up? 
 
Renee  03:07 
It was quite small. I remember, some of my first memories was my mom had a little grocery store out 
East End Road. And the road was gravel, of course at the time, and it was so infrequently traveled, that 
there was grass and weeds that would grow up in the middle of the of the road, going out east there. 
And it was, it was right there. Mom's little grocery store was that right at four-mile east end road. So it 
was just beyond the turn onto Kachemak Drive. It was just beyond that, that turn but it was on the right 
hand side of the road as you go out East End 
 
Josh Wisniewski  03:59 
Was the road from Anchorage to Homer paved at that time. 
 
Renee  04:04 
No, that was a gravel road. And it would it would take my folks were really wanted us to have good 
dental care, but there was no dentist in Homer at the time. So every six months, we would get in the car 
and it was a four hour drive from Homer to Soldotna, because it was gravel instead of payment. Now 
you can do it what in a hour and a half. Oh, wow. Yeah. 
 
Josh Wisniewski  04:35 
Oh Wow! Four hours, I thought you were going to say four hours to Anchorage. 
 
Renee  04:38 
It  was more like eight hours to Anchorage 
 
Josh 04:42 
That's a drive!

Josh Wisniewski  04:45 
So, I was wondering if you could describe a little bit what the what the fisheries in Kachemak Bay were 
like in the Homer and Seldovia based fisheries. I know there was shrimp and crab and halibut and I was 
wondering if you could describe some of the what those were like? 
 
Renee  05:01 
So, I remember when I was young, some of the Homer fishermen that were developing the king crab 
fishery, here in Kachemak Bay at the time, would come to mom's store and swear to secrecy they were 
buying the canned cat food and dog food to use in the pots as bait, they would just take a can opener to 
the can and, and that was that worked, I guess quite well to chum in the king crab. And they would also, 
if they had a tab with mom, some of the payment would be large crab. And it's hard to say you got sick 
of eating king crab.  But, you did. But I remember almost losing the end of my thumb, because I was 
playing with one of the large critters. And I thought it was not as lively as it was and it did grab a hold of 
me. And the the king crab were huge back then. 
 
Josh Wisniewski  06:22 
and the what kind of boats were they fishing because people think of crabbers today. But um, what kind 
of what kind of boats 
 
Renee  06:30 
mean, some of them were probably even using their Seiners and stuff, they're, you know, they were 
they, you know, they were, they were just kind of developing the fishery, and that all evolved to the size 
boat and what worked and what didn't, and when they fished and when they didn't, and it was more, it 
was more industry driven, you know, there weren't wasn't a lot of rules and regulations as to, you know, 
whether they were looking at the biomass of, of what was out there was it was all it was all pretty much 
open range. You know, just developing all of that. 
 
Josh Wisniewski  07:18 
 At that  time, was that more of a day fishery folks would go out for you know, if they were fishing Yeah, 
 
Renee  07:25 
I doubt if they you if they had any lighting, like, you know, I know that it evolved fairly quickly, where 
they would go out and, you know, fish in the darker hours, and go further out and stuff eventually.  But 
you have to remember this, this would have been in like the mid to mid to late 60s. You know, what, 
when my memory started to click in and, you know, was pretty young, when the king crab nabbed me 
there, I think I was probably, you know, four or five, six years old, something like that. 
 
Josh Wisniewski  08:10 
And so then out of that, it kind of develops into more boats that were even then designed specifically for 
crab fishing and fishing with pots.

Renee  08:19 
Right, right, and they would, you know, the fisherman would go out in the wintertime and maybe bring 
something up from Seattle that oh, you know, this is this is going to work better and you know, to 
develop, you know, different pots and what worked as far as the implements to catch the crab and that 
type of thing. 
 
Josh Wisniewski  08:45 
do you recall the names of any of those early boats? 
 
Renee  08:48 
Um, yeah, we're, we're on that page. They're on Facebook, Historical Homer and you know, there was 
there was all different you know, there was the Invader and Robert and I helped take that boat down to 
Port Townsend. It was 80 years old at the time and needed work. But yeah, there was quite a few 
vessels that I remember you know, like the Celtic up there and the Cape Chacon and the Bessie M, 
there was quite a few different vessels that I remember as a kid. 
 
Josh Wisniewski  09:32 
I remember at least Nancy telling me about Johnny Hilstrand owning the Invader. Yes. Did he own it 
when you went down to Port Townsend? 
 
Renee  09:41 
Townsend? No, that was Danny Verrhusen and that owned it then that used to live in halibut Cove at 
the time? But I do remember when John Hillstrand had it as well. 
 
Josh Wisniewski  09:57 
do you remember how long that trip took you to Port Townsend, 
 
Renee  10:00 
Oh gosh, I'm going to have to say maybe a couple of weeks. Because we left, we left 1981 We left in 
this first part of December. And we had a horrible time didn't take limping along boat down from Homer 
to Port Townsend and we made it as far as Seldovia the first night. And of course, hit the Lynwood and 
had a hell of a hangover and started around The Gulf and made it this into Elfin Cove, just by the skin 
of our teeth and had to kind of hole up there for a couple of days. And then, you know, we would have 
to really pick our weather. There were 13 scarfs in the bow stem. And so, anytime it would, you know, 
hit you know, hit the wave and take up a little bit of a plunge into the wave you'd have to go down into 
the engine room with your rain gear on because it would spew saltwater through all those scarfs. It 
really needed a lot of work. Yeah, my folks thought they'd never see me again. And that was just after 
Robert and I got together and got married. And they were thinking, “Oh, what is she thinking?”

So I guess following that I guess my question would be, you know, when did you/ How and when did 
you get involved in fishing and move across to the south side of the bay? 
 
Renee  11:46 
So my dad was an avid sports fisherman and he always had a boat and at first it was a skiff, and then it 
was a Hamm haul. And so I was the kid that really liked to go fishing with them. And every chance we 
got, we would, on the weekends, he was quite busy during the week, but we would we would go and 
spend the whole day just being on the south side of the bay here and that's where I developed the love 
for it and really enjoying this side of the Bay and then when I originally when I met Robert, he had that 
the Ragtime and it was just such a beautiful wooden boat. I'll have to get a better picture of it to show 
you, but I would see it tied up in the Homer harbor and I would go and I would I would walk the docks 
and sometimes it would be with my dad or later on. I came back from my first year of college and saw 
the boat and saw Robert there and we started to talk about his boat and where it was built and went up 
and got a burger at the Glacier Drive-in and the relationship started there. So, it was it was all on the 
boat. It was on the wooden boat. 
 
Josh Wisniewski  13:31 
Who built the Ragtime? 
 
Renee  13:33 
So a fellow that actually lived here in Seldovia. His name was Mike Ballough, he was an avid boat 
builder, and he just made the most beautiful, small wooden boats. And then I know that there's a few of 
them still around. Some in Seldovia and some have become potato patches here and there. But that so 
that's where the Ragtime was built. It had a it had a one lung inboard in it that you started with a 
flywheel and we actually fished it the first year, when I came in 1980, we that was the only boat we had 
to fish with it on our set net fishery. And it was rather kamikaze coming up on the nets because you 
couldn't put it in reverse. And, you know, you'd have to really scrutinize the current and the way the 
wind was blowing, because you'd have to shut the boat off and you had a cane to catch the first cork on 
the net. And has to stop the boat basically. 
 
Josh Wisniewski  14:59 
it would have been over Very heavy boat. 
 
Renee  15:01 
It was it was a fairly heavy boat yes and but it was just a wonderful boat to pick out of it was a it was an 
actual Grand Bank dory. And people were always so concerned about us because when two people 
would stand on the same side you were pretty low in the water but it made it pretty easy for picking the 
nets because you didn't you didn't have to lean over as far and or have the gunnel get you right there in 
the stomach trying to pick fish out of the out of the net. So, it really was it really was a wonderful boat to 
set that with you just couldn't pack much in it. You know, it wasn't that wide and you couldn't put a lot of 
fish in there. And it took so long to get back around the corner from the backside of McDonald Spit to to 
the inside to put your fish.   When I worked at the bank, and was coming over that in the summer of 79 
Renee Purpura, fisherman, Seldovia

to visit Robert. They would fly me in, in a Cessna to the airstrip in Jackalof. And I could hear Robert 
firing up the Ragtime with that one lung inboard all the way at the end of McDonald Spit And it would 
take him an hour and a half to get him to pick me up in Jackalof Wow. Yeah. So, it went about I don't 
know, five knots? 
 
 
Josh Wisniewski  16:51 
So, if you had good traveling weather, how long would it take to go from McDonald Spit to Homer, 
 
Renee  16:58 
Homer? Oh, gosh, maybe like three hours? Yeah, three or four hours? 
 
Josh Wisniewski  17:06 
Well, when I first got Martin's old, dory, and first met Robert, one of the things where I felt I had bonded 
with him was him telling us we were both dory men, that we both been sory men in our day. And I 
thought I was super cool to share that with him. So how did you set your net out of a boat like that? 
 
Renee  17:31 
We didn't set with that; we were partners with Dave Seaman.  So the nets would get set out of his 
original Skiff that he had built, the Merlin. And we used Captain Haddock in our portion to go out and do 
our picks. 
 
Josh Wisniewski  17:54 
in would you were you able to haul the net in with (the Ragtime) 
 
Renee  17:58 
No, we would always go out and haul the nets set and haul the nets in in Dave's boat at the time. 
 
Josh Wisniewski  18:08 
So you came over with Robert, but would you share a little bit about Robert maybe how he started 
fishing and kind of how he came over here? 
 
Renee  18:18 
So I think Robert came originally, He came from the East Coast to Alaska in the winter time. I think it 
might have been like, in the early 70s. And he worked as a he was a maitre d at the country club in 
New York City. And it's like the oldest country club on the Eastern Seaboard, and they wouldn't give 
him enough time off to come to Alaska.  But he quit his job, which was just unheard of, because you'd 
get like a $10,000 Christmas bonus at that time, and this is back in the early 70s. So that was like it was 
like big money. And but he quit his job and he came to Alaska and he met he met Dave Seaman at that 
time and they were they were really  interested in skiing and doing Alyeska and they met originally at a 
restaurant or a soup kitchen in Anchorage and they both did dishwashing shifts, alternate shifts, and 
that's that's how he came to Alaska. And then when he was there in Anchorage, he taught a cooking

American Folklife Center 
 
 
- 7 - 
course at the Cuddy Center which is affiliated with UAA strike They're on the campus. It's actually their 
cafeteria for the University of Alaska, and Mrs. Hillstrand that had Lands’ End at the time, she called the 
Cuddy Center and asked if they had somebody that they could send to Homer to be the chef at Land's 
End. And so, Robert took her up on that. And that's how we came to Homer. And then he, and then I 
I'm not quite sure how Dave came. But, but Dave, came about the same time. And they started to come 
to recreate on the south side of the Bay. I think Dave was at Land’s End as well working. And that's 
how they got to this side of the Bay. And then I'm not sure who got involved in the set netting originally, 
but I think, I think Robert, decided this looks pretty interesting. And so, in 1978, he, he decided that he 
was going to give it a try. And it was late in the season. He didn't have he didn't have anything. So he 
was he went to Port Graham and he was talking, I think the cannery was still in operation there. And he 
he pulled old webbing out of the dumpsters there and rehung it and, and, you know, laced it up as best 
he could, because he didn't know how to mend at the time, really. And that was the year that in 1978, 
when it was just phenomenal. The reds just came in to Kachemak Bay and stayed for like three weeks. 
At about the end of the first week in July, there was no he there, he didn't catch hardly anything. He 
was, you know, looking around for what sites to set and he didn't know how to fish really. And he was 
talking to an old-time fisherman there on the end of McDonald Spit, Sarah Baxter. And she would would 
give them pointers. And the Ross’s there at Baraara Point kind of took him under their wing and was 
teaching them how to you know, how to set his gear and work his gear and Sylvia would sit there and 
talk a blue streak and you have to really follow how she mended because she, it was to her it was just 
like knitting, and she would sit there and talk to you and you learned how to men by just watching Sylvia 
mend her gear and talk to you at the same time. And it was just it was just an incredible season that he 
had. The nets were sinking and he'd have to you'd fall asleep holding onto the onto the gear so that it 
wouldn't sink totally out of sight. That sinking with fish is sinking with fish, yeah. Yeah.  He always 
talked about 1978 he wish she could see one more year like 1978 because it's never happened and 
Kachemak Bay since. 
 
Josh Wisniewski  23:50 
1978 is a legendary year for our local set net fishery. I was going ask you a little bit about just what the 
at that time here just what the way of life was like, I mean, you're off the road system from Homer. So, 
it's a very boat driven lifestyle, but also from what I understand the history lots of younger and newer 
people were moving into the area too and maybe just you can just talk a little bit about what that was 
like. 
 
Renee  24:25 
Okay. So yeah, um, well, at that time, there were several of us that found these old cannery scows and 
originally, we thought oh would that would be a great thing to have your net racks on so you could you 
could clean and mend your nets and have your fish totes on that barge too and be a float when tender 
came around the corner to pick up your fish, you were you would just have your little living situation out 
there in the middle of Kasitsna Bay. And you know, there were little communities.  In Little Tutka there 
were quite a few people that were like minded and had, you know, that type of lifestyle where, you 
know, we were all just kind of living off the grid. And in different, some of us had land, some of us didn't, 
and some of us were living afloat, and others actually had cabins in different areas. And it, it was, it was 
Renee Purpura, fisherman, Seldovia 
Interviewed by Josh Wisniewski and Marissa Wilson 11/20/2021 
American Folklife Center 
 
 
- 8 - 
just a time that we all kind of came together and it's, not really there anymore. I mean Little Tutka 
doesn't really have that many year-round residents anymore, but we could get we could all get together 
and have a potluck at somebody's house for Thanksgiving and draw a name to make a gift for 
Christmas and have another potluck at somebody else's place whether, it was on you know, a float out 
in your house boat, which was kind of hard, you'd have to have several boats all rafted up together and 
do it that way. Or you could be at Greg and Sandy Christen and a sauna would be fired up. And, but, 
and then the children, they were being homeschooled and all incorporated in the general conversation. 
And it was just, it was just amazing lifestyle, and I'm so glad that I was able to participate in that, 
because it was something very special. 
 
Josh Wisniewski  27:18 
rRally it seems like the way you're describing it is a building community. 
 
Renee  27:24 
Yeah, we'd all get together and help each other whether it was to drive a few nails or you know, get 
together and have big canning parties to put up some winter food or you know, it was just it was just 
that type of community where we all helped each other out and, and we all were very diverse people, 
but it was it was always an in a great conversation when you all got together. 
 
Josh Wisniewski  28:03 
Sure. So where were you in Robert living at that time. 
 
Renee  28:08 
So when we…this kind of an interesting story. I was thinking about this this morning. That year of 79, a 
winter of 80. We dated and then I was working at the National Bank of Alaska as the drive thru teller. 
And most weekends I would try to come over and visit with Robert on the side of the Bay. And they 
actually gave me a letter of probation. And it said at the top it said and again, Renee Rosie went across 
the Bay. And Robert would say and this time she stayed. And so in May 17th of 1980 we married and 
the day before was just lovely and we were going to have an outdoor wedding on the end of 
MacDonald Spit there between Nubble Point and Nubble’s brother, but it was blowing about 40 knots 
and raining horizontally. So we said well as long as Brother Isaiah who was one of the original bare- 
footers in Homer, if he made it over to do the, the ceremony, and so it was about 30 people that 
showed up and Phil Broudy, who owned the Joyride, which was a seiner, he brought Brother Isaiah and 
it was either the Naomi  or the Nanook with Jack Estel  and, and he brought his family and a few people  
from Little Tutka, mostly the local community there. And there was there was, it was series a low tide 
and there was a bank in Palmer that would have their like, picnic on the beach there and do some clam 
digging and they happen to be there on the 17th of May. And we were hanging out.  We did it on our 
flat old Founder that was where the ceremony was. And it was still in the processing being built. So, 
you see our wedding picture here. And that that was that was that day. And, and we were able to get 
the 30 people and Cheryl Reynolds rom Seldovia. She was pregnant at the time, and she walked out, 
McDonald Spit carrying the cake, because she had made the cake. And so, Larry Reynolds was the 
doctor here and a good friend of Robert’s and then still is, of course, good friends of ours. But that we 
Renee Purpura, fisherman, Seldovia

- 9 - 
you know, as long as I say I did the ceremony and the people came we would we would go ahead. But I 
always felt so bad about those 50 or so people from the from the bank because they were not they 
were not geared up for it to be nasty weather like that. And they look down from McDonald's spit the 
backside of that where the beach grass is and they were wondering, well, how can we join that party 
down there? I'm getting way off. 
 
Josh Wisniewski  32:18 
No, not way off. This is your story. I wanted to ask you a little bit more about fishing. Because you 
described Little Tutka as such a community and a lifestyle of people all coming back over here living off 
a lot of seafood and that they were harvesting themselves and it seems like fishing was really a 
lifestyle. 
 
Renee  32:47 
Yes, that's the way we always thought about it. It wasn't, you know, wasn't any get rich quick scheme or 
anything. It was just, it just kind of evolved. We liked the community. We'd like to live in a float it was it 
was where we could do it. We, you know were able to be invest in the permits. And this established the 
sites and you know, it just kind of all went hand in hand living like having a lifestyle where you lived 
afloat to be involved in in the set net fishery there on McDonald Spit. And you know, there were quite a 
few different people that were involved in that too besides us it was Dave Seaman was our fish partner 
and Robert had a permit and then I was able to get a permit and we established more sites and Sara 
Baxter's fished there on McDonald Spit for many, many years. I'm not quite sure how, how many but for 
a long, long period of time. And then of course Vern and, Sylvia Ross, commercially fished up at Moose 
Point up up Cook Inlet and then kind of retired to Barabara Creek and continue to commercially fish 
there for a period of years with their son and his and his wife and their grandchildren. And so that's, 
that's what it was more about was kind of a fishing community. More than you know, I know that I know 
that it's not like fishing the Bering Sea on big boats where it's it requires a great deal of money and a 
crew and all of that it was, it was more of a family situation. And we were all community of friends that 
were that were doing it so 
 
Josh Wisniewski  35:24 
You all lived where you fished, you didn't travel somewhere else to do it, 
 
Renee  35:31 
Right, and we were we were local people, local residents, whereas some of the other even some of the 
other set net fisheries in Alaska are more coming from elsewhere and just maybe just fishing the what 
they call the peak. And, you know, we fished from the first Monday in June until we decided we'd had 
enough.  And you know, some seasons. The first the first season Robert nine, married we made all of 
$3,000 it was just not a really good season and we were kind of just starting out and we just had the 
one permit and so often times we kind of joke well we have to go away to support our fishing habit is 
the way we would put it.  So we were sitting in the Salty Dawg with our last $20 the fall of 1980 and 
somebody came in said he was looking for a cook for the king crab fishery in the Bering Sea and 
Robert said I’ll go and we came home and pack to sea bag and he was gone for 45 days and I was I

was there alone on McDonald's spit for that amount of time and that was that was very strange. I 
gained a lot of confidence while he was gone, that I had to take care of myself and you know, beat on 
the outboard if it wasn't running and just just make Do you know. 
 
Marissa  37:23 
Now can I asked a point of clarification you use the phrase living afloat? Is that a figure of speech you 
talking about? houseboats? Was there like a community? 
 
Renee  37:30 
Yeah, there was. We we lived afloat and that wasn't necessarily a houseboat. We had taken an old 
cannery scow from John Peters had it sitting up on the beach grass in his yard there up Tutka Bay. And 
it was it was you know, probably from back in I think they had those cannery scows at the end of the 
fish wheels and so that's what they came and they were probably from the 20s and you know the side 
that was in shade was rotten and so they come-a longed down the beach and you know filled up full of 
old barrels and a bit of Styrofoam to get it to float and you know he built an eight by eight shack on it 
and had his  net racks and totes for fish and then well this would be a great idea let's just make the 
whole thing a house and so that this is the old Flounder here 
 
Josh Wisniewski  38:56 
it is that the inside of the Flounder? 
 
Renee  38:59 
The inside of the flounder yeah that's when he made the bigger house and that was still unfinished 
inside. And so that's that was that's I guess what I call living afloat. And there were others Dave 
Seaman did the same thing. He found an old cannery scowl and then Randy Arsenault He found one 
and built the house on his and enticed his girlfriend from back east to come up and s0 Bernadette's 
become a fixture as well and that's how we all live to afloat. 
 
Josh Wisniewski  39:47 
So afloat you live you live on float houses and then and then getting around on boats. 
 
Renee  39:56 
yeah, we use we used our skill we know because we didn't have running water or electricity, you know, 
we lived off the grid that way. And so, everything you had to accomplish was like people get in their 
cars and commute to their work or to the grocery store, we did the same thing in our boats. And, and, 
you know, it was, you know, you jumped in your, you didn't think anything of it, you jumped in your boat, 
and you would go get your water from the closest stream and you'd have to go to your friend's house 
where you had a little place in their freezer, and you know, and then no telephones. Everything you 
communicated on CB radio with your neighbors. You know, if you could occasionally make a marine 
operator call. So, you know, you took your laundry did town to wash it every month if you ran out of 
clean clothes, and that's how we lived, you know.

Josh Wisniewski  41:22 
So very local, in very in a place. 
 
Renee  41:26 
Yes, we didn't move around too much. We would like you'd have to find up a fairly you know, place that 
was out of the weather, you know that you could tie up where you'd stay afloat. We call this the pothole 
because the channels in and out would go dry half tide. But though there was always water underneath 
you in that little bite or little cove. 
 
Josh Wisniewski  42:10 
In that pothole is in Little Tutka Yes. But you didn't start living in Little Tutka? 
 
Renee  42:17 
No, we were on the end of McDonald Spit with the old Flounder originally. And we stayed there for a 
couple of years. And that same place in between Nubble Point and Sara Baxter's place, there's a this, 
the tide would go out and you would sit on really hard packed, flat sand and we were tied off. We were 
tied off to the beach in the back. triangulated. And then we had a couple of anchors out front. So, we 
were tied off four points. And you would pretty much just go up and down with the tides and when the 
tide was out, you were you could get out and just walk around. You could get on and off the boat that 
way. 
 
Josh Wisniewski  43:17 
You must have had a few at least a couple interesting storms or something that you weathered? 
 
Renee  43:23 
Yeah, that that was a very interesting place to live on the end of McDonald Spit. It was pretty protected. 
But on those unless higher tides, the nineteens and above with a bad Southeaster it could get pretty 
choppy and there, you know, and you would have some nights that you might not sleep very well. 
 
Josh Wisniewski  43:59 
In addition to your fishing, you described Robert going out on the crabber that year that you made not 
very much money.  But fishing on other boats to supplement your income was a large part of his life 
too. 
 
Renee  44:18 
Yes, he made quite a career for himself for crab fishing, and then he got involved with the black cod 
fishery. The Kamishak Queen This was probably mid 80s to early 90s. I can't exactly remember what 
years those were but that was the one of the smallest catcher processors in the Gulf of Alaska, they will 
Go out for about two weeks and fill up that that freezer on the Kamishak Queen. And Robert’s job was 
to keep the fishermen well fed and he did a lot of wheel watches when the skipper had to lay down and 
he was he was quite the good hand on board when Robert passed away I got an incredible amount of 
people that got in touch with me that just said boy, they that you know, he was and then an incredibly 
Renee Purpura, fisherman, Seldovia 
Interviewed by Josh Wisniewski and Marissa Wilson 11/20/2021

- 12 - 
good friend and person that you'd want to have on a boat if things were going wrong or even if things 
weren't he just could keep every everybody together and healthy.  
 
Josh Wisniewski: He had a special personality 
 
Renee: He did have a special personality for sure. 
 
Josh Wisniewski  46:10 
Maybe if you're comfortable speaking too. One other aspect of of Robert fishing is that it was mobility 
was something he struggled with, and I wonder if you could talk a little bit 
 
Renee  46:24 
Sure, so Robert had a disability that happened later on in life. The had to wear a full-length brace on his 
right leg. And the injury happened in 1978 in the early fall of 1978, and I met him the spring of 1979. So, 
he was just recuperating from this horrible injury to his knee. And he really did not have a knee to 
support him. So, he had to wear this full length brace on his on his right leg. And originally, he couldn't 
wear rubber boots. So, it was kind of hard to be a fisherman that when you couldn't wear rubber boots, 
he had a that that brace had a stirrup under his that was built that was built into like a hiking boot. And I 
oftentimes if we were trying to get back on to the flounder when we were on McDonald Spit. I would 
have to carry him so he wouldn't get his feet wet those last few feet. And he joked with a friend of his 
that he went and duck honey with his name is Danny Knowles and he used to have the Tasmania here 
in Seldovia. And they went they went duck hunting across the inlet. And Dennis goes “well, how, you 
know you don't have rubber boots, you're going to get super wet.  How does this work Robert “My wife 
carries me. So, Dennis turns around and Robert climbs on, and then Robert says oh, well, there's 
something missing. And he just about dropped him off his back. But, yes, Robert had quite a disability 
that he had to overcome. But he had the incredible fortitude and desire to do what he loved. And part of 
it was being out there in the ocean on those big boats and feeding people.  Food was super important, 
Yeah. 
 
Josh Wisniewski  49:16 
I wanted to ask you about your sites. You fished in Kasitsna Bay and around McDonald Spit mostly. 
Could you describe maybe geographically where your sites were in Kasitsna Bay? 
 
Renee  49:31 
So, we fished with several different people. And we established and disestablished many, many places. 
But basically, it was open from the mouth of Jackalof Bay. And one of the sites was right there on the 
point at Jackalof Bay. And then you would kind of march around the corner and we had a we had a 
couple of sites that were there in front of the NOAA lab. And also on the bar there on the inside of 
McDonald Spit kind of where the old clam cannery was there the Ecrins clam cannery that we had a 
couple of sites off that sandbar where the good clamming is, and then we have a site that was kind of in 
the corner in inside McDonald Spit kind of there were what's the Doctor Paine, Lou Paine had a cabin 
Renee Purpura, fisherman, Seldovia 
Interviewed by Josh Wisniewski and Marissa Wilson 11/20/2021

- 13 - 
there. We call that one the flounder pounder. We had different names for sites. At the end, that was the 
founder pounder because that's what it caught, it caught a lot of flounder. 
 
Josh Wisniewski  51:04 
Do you remember the names for any of your other sites? 
 
Renee  51:08 
That one really sticks in my mind and the ones on the sandbar I think we call them bar one and bar two. 
Just because they were there on the sandbar and we fished we we really experimented with offshore 
sites, you know the ones that weren't attached to the land with the leads.  We moved many many sites 
around offshore and when we when we became partners with Jane and Ann Abbott the sisters. Pat and 
Ann Daigle, and Jane and Tim Wilkes. They bought out the Paine boys. And so we had the opportunity 
to fish Nubble Point, which is was probably the key net off the end of Nubble Point. And that opened up 
for some of the backside of McDonnell spit to us. Since we all fished together. There were several sites 
on the backside and McDonald's spit as well. So pretty much that entire area and it's open. It's it starts 
at the mouth of Jackalof and it goes down to the base of Mcdonald Spit and then it's not sure exactly if  
there is short closure and then Barabra Point, that area and then there's also here in Seldovia Bay. A 
good friend of ours, Dave Chartier and his family have set net sites here in Seldovia Bay and also in 
Halibut Cove. And so, when we decided that we would really like to value add for our fishery, we were 
able to kind of come together as a loose group and started to market our fish together as well. So that 
was that was really an interesting time when we weren't just selling to whatever tender came through 
as well. 
 
Josh Wisniewski  53:56 
Well maybe you could talk about that a little bit. I was interested in first maybe who you sold to when 
you guys were first starting and then how Robert kind of first came up with the idea a little bit of 
marketing and selling your own fish. 
 
Renee  54:16 
Yes. So, when we first started the cannery here in Seldovia was still going, and that changed hands 
many many times and I can't remember all of the different names that it was and I know that Robert 
would remember but I just don't really I know that Sea Galley had it for a couple of years which was 
kind of interesting. But the cannery here was still open which was nice because you know there that 
that was the economy here for Seldovia as well. But there were also quite a few cash buyers that would 
come there were there are all kinds of tenders that would, would come through Kasitsna Bay and they 
were all vying for fish. And so, you could sell, you could sell to the same cannery the entire season. 
And if you weren't happy with that, you could go to a cash buyer and hope for the best that there wasn't 
a little bump after the season from, from the main cannery here.  I think what we got really tired of 
dealing with the, the status quo is that ice wasn't always available. And you were at the whim of 
whichever establishment you were selling to, and whether or not they were going to send the tender 
often enough to keep the product from going bad in your totes. You know, it was just, it was a hard, it 
was a hard time, then because you couldn't always guarantee that you would have enough ice to make 
Renee Purpura, fisherman, Seldovia

- 14 - 
the period. And that is when the idea started developing that it would be kind of nice to keep a hold of 
the ownership of your fish and make sure that they were a quality product. And not just you know, 
something that had to be thrown over the side, you know, once you sold it or put in a can and you 
know, it was it was just it, it was just a horrible thing to do is such a lovely fish. You know, that's, I think 
that's what we took offense to the most. And so that's kind of what developed. We started to think, well, 
I we'd like to see more of this go fresh. And we always heard from the restaurants in Homer that you 
know, they had to get their product sent back to them from Washington from Seattle.  You know, it went 
out and it got frozen up and then it would come back. And they couldn't get you know, fresh fis, you 
know, they wanted to have you know, something that you know, they could impress people with when 
they cooked it. And so we started originally we would ever every Wednesday on Saturday when we had 
two 48 hours a week and we would put we get orders together from the different restaurants whether it 
was Land's End and the Porpoise Room and as far out east as the Homestead and we would put 
together these little ship to shore totes with their orders and we would load those out of our skiff when 
we bring into the Homer harbor and drive them out as far as the homestead on ice and they would get it 
within 24 hours of being caught and I don't know what kind of gray area we were skirting but we were 
we were making that happen and you know it was very really appreciated the restaurants really liked it 
and that's that's how that kind of evolved and then we were in Valdez one winter I was tagging pink 
salmon smolt and fry in Valdez there for a few years and Robert would come with me and Will Stark 
Sandy Christen’s  son is the banker in Valdez and has been for many many years now. But when he 
first started out, he gave us a loan while we were there and Robert bought the first MacBook the first 
laptop and a little printer that would only do one page at a time. And he went through all of these 
gourmet magazines, gourmet cooking magazines, and they're there in the back there, they had all of 
the list of the restaurants and who bought their seafood and he would send off these letters. 900 letters 
to restaurants all around the country. And that's kind of how that was born, we got a we got two or three 
hits from that. But we were trying to establish value added product. And then that evolved to getting our 
own tender and the fish factory started up and we would follow the fish from the nets to the totes to the 
tender, and then we would go and stand at the end of the of the line and look in every fish belly as they 
were headed and gutted. And they would get packed up and off to Favco and New Sagiya in 
Anchorage were some of our two first people that started to buy Kachemak Bay Salmon producers. 
Salmon. 
 
Josh Wisniewski  1:01:57 
Neat. So Robert, in a lot of ways was a real I want to say almost early innovator. 
 
Renee  1:02:08 
who He really was, it was he, he and just a couple of other people were starting to do that. I know it was 
we you know, there were in the cup in the Copper River fishery there was they were doing similar 
things. And we were just trying to be somewhat innovative. And you know, it was a bit of a risk because 
you're not only selling your own fish, but you're going together as a group and you're setting price and 
you have to take into consideration every penny and half penny and when you I forget the name of 
when you gut a fish too, you have to take into consideration that loss and what your what your bottom 
line is and what you have to sell that fish for to make it. You know, so you're not selling in the red.

- 15 - 
 
Josh Wisniewski  1:03:24 
That's amazing. 
 
Renee  1:03:27 
And he was just incredibly bright that way, you know, he made his own spreadsheets. And you know, 
you have the wharfage and this tax and that tax and the you have to make sure that all of those 
pennies are accounted for and just very innovative and bright and for a ninth grade drop out. 
 
Josh Wisniewski  1:03:58 
And that and that developed, in essence from you both selling your fish yourselves locally, to then 
organizing most of the set net fishermen here in Kachemak. Bay or helping them organize? 
 
Renee  1:04:16 
Yes, and came together as a group. Yeah. And it was it was nearly every person originally that was 
fishing at the time from and even a couple of the fishermen in Port Graham who were established in 
that early on and from Halibut Cove all the way to Seldovia Bay. I think at one time Robert said that was 
32 fishermen. 
 
Josh Wisniewski  1:04:52 
Amazing. One question I wanted to ask and I didn't ask you before was, It is two questions. One is at 
some point you moved from McDonald Spit to Little Tutka Bay. And then following up on that you 
eventually moved off the Flounder your float house into a houseboat. And I wonder if you could … 
 
Renee  1:05:16 
So, one Thanksgiving, we towed the Flounder from the end of McDonald Spit into the pothole in in Little 
Tutka and the reason being is we realized that it was we were going to go and have Thanksgiving 
dinner and you know, the, the daylight hours are quite short and we didn't want to come home and the 
dark in our Skiff back to the Flounder on McDonald Spit. And, you know, we wanted to have a nice time 
into the late evening hours there and so we just took our house with us so we had our own bed to sleep 
in. And we wouldn't be right there in Little Tutka where the festivities were happening and rather than 
tow the Flounder back home to McDonald Spit, we just decided well we're going to stay here in a Little 
Tutka. 
 
Josh Wisniewski  1:06:31 
and that when you moved into the pothole, 
 
Renee  1:06:33 
that's when we moved into the pothole. And then and then. So and it was it was just shortly after that. 
Our friend, Greg Christen was building the Marlinspike it hadn't been named yet in his big boat shop 
there in Little Tutka and he decided that it was a labor of love on his part. It's a Norwegian, taken on the 
lines of a Norwegian sailing scow, and he decided well, he didn't think that he was ever really going to 
Renee Purpura, fisherman, Seldovia 
Interviewed by Josh Wisniewski and Marissa Wilson 11/20/2021

- 16 - 
use it like he thought he would so he was going to sell it, and he sold it to Robert and I and that's how 
we ended up with the Marlinspike and moved out of the old Flounder the old Flounder became our 
storage shed and it was tied up next to the Marlinspike there in the pothole in Little Tutka Bay. 
 
Josh Wisniewski  1:07:43 
And then you would take the Marlinspike out into Kasitsna Bay for your fishing season. 
 
Renee  1:07:48 
Yes we we did at first we would take it out and it was hard to live a float there in Kasitsna Bay because 
it was so busy there with boat traffic and some of the big cabin cruisers would go by and might not be 
up on step and they would there would be a horrible waves from that and so many dishes… 
 
Josh Wisniewski  1:08:26 
Oh, I’m sure 
 
Renee  1:08:28 
so that's why we decided that we probably we just stay in the pothole then after that and just go in our 
boats to go make our picks and go pull the gear from and have our home base there in Little Tutka.  But 
that's kind of the nice thing about being on a liveaboard and living a float is so you can change your 
scenery. It's kind of like having an RV on the water. 
 
Josh Wisniewski  1:09:07 
Super Special, Um, I was wondering, you started by fishing a boat called the Ragtime that Mike 
Balough built who was a local Seldovia builder. But you've had other boats since then. And I was 
wondering if you could talk about some of the other boats you had? 
 
Renee  1:09:21 
Sure. So, um, we realized that the Ragtime had its limitations. And so that fall we were there in in 
Homer and a friend of ours. Michael Kennedy  had a like a you used mercantile right there where the W 
KFL Park is now next to the fire hall.  And it was called The Last Chance and there was an old fella in 
Homer. His name was Frank Rought and he had taken his old skiff by there that was named after 
nickname after his daughter, the Binki and it was an old plank skiff that was rather it was almost as 
wide as it was long and so it wasn't the most seaworthy boat but Michael had it there and I think we 
gave them $300 For that old skiff and brought it over to Dave's boat shop in Little Tutka and he added a 
new beefed up the bow stem with a spruce crook natural knee and this there in the stern as well. And 
so, we called that boat the Last Chance after Michael Kennedy's secondhand store there and there's a 
picture of it here somewhere too. I'll have to show it to you in a minute. But so that was one of our skiffs 
that we fished there for a couple years.  And it had its limitations to it was not very good and a following 
sea. You might like bury your bow and get just absolutely soaking wet because it was it was so short. It 
just wasn't the most seaworthy boat to have. And so, after the Last Chance we really liked the look of 
the boats that Dave Seaman was building at the time these beautiful lapstrake skiffs. And when Robert 
went out to the Bering Sea one year  he said you're going to choose our next boat and I had a choice of 
Renee Purpura, fisherman, Seldovia 
Interviewed by Josh Wisniewski and Marissa Wilson 11/20/2021 
American Folklife Center 
 
 
- 17 - 
two different boats i It was between Dave's lapstrake skiffs or the boats that Renn Toman made and so 
that I it was it was up to me to choose the next boat that we were going to have made Renn came over 
from Homer with one of his skiffs and they have merit, they're lightweight enough you can actually push 
them back into the water if they go dry and I liked that they have a little bit of a V in the hull.  And you 
could get behind the stern of those and push them right back into the water. It was amazing. But the 
thing that I didn't like about that boat is the sides were a little high and you know being so short up in 
the bow I'd have to either have my feet up off the deck and over the side trying to grab a hold of the net, 
or you know maybe have to build some floorboards or something in there to make it comfortable. So we 
ended up having a boat named Captain Haddock made. Dave Seaman built that for us. And it was a 
lovely skiff. And then we have another one made. Oh a few years after that, and that's Bianca and was 
another one just a little bit longer and about the same width as Captain Haddock and we also bought a, 
friend of ours in Homer had a Fredrikson skiff and was a taxi and he had it it was checker Blue was 
painted checker board. And you could see him going through the harbor and you could yell out taxi taxi, 
and he'd come and pick you up and you could you could go anywhere you wanted to go it was probably 
the first water taxi in Homer back in the 80s. Sometime Phil Clovertaughts. Yeah, and we have that 
Fredriksson it had a 90 horse on it and you could go out and you could pull all six nets in the boat and 
that was quite the time saver there. And it I'm not even sure how long it was maybe like 21-22 feet and 
maybe like eight feet wide. It was quite the packer. 
 
Josh Wisniewski  1:15:01 
and those are traditional set net skiffs for Cook Inlet? 
 
Renee  1:15:05 
yes it says Cook Inlet set net skiff and fellow by the name of Fredrikson used to build those. So that 
was another one of our boats and then I have a picture of a little boat that in here that we actually 
brought back from Port Townsend on the invader when we when we came back it's a little lake boat 
cute little strip plank thing and I had that for a while a little wooden boat. Yeah, that's that's her that's 
the Sea-nymph that was my little runabout I would go up to the Tutka get hatchery with that. That was 
my that was my little speed deamon. So, we had lots of skiffs in our lives. And we and we had an 
interesting we had names for them that were based on the Tin-Tin comics. So, all of our boats are 
named Marlinspike is after Marlinspike Hall, which is Captain Haddock’s estate. And then of course 
Captain Haddock was named after that too. And then Bianca is the opera singer in the Tin Tiin comics. 
And we had, we had a lund that we called Tintin and the little, the little boat that we found that was, oh, 
it was, like, row to shore boat that we called snowy. It was something that we found on McDonald Spit 
after a horrible storm and never could find the owner for it. And I can't remember what we called the 
Fredriksson. But it they were all they were all in the in that same theme. 
 
Josh Wisniewski  1:17:14 
Yeah, I love the history of your boats, and that they were local, built by Dave Seaman who was one of 
the other residents of Little Tutka at that time, kind of speaks to the whole community that was there 
and that you were creating. One of the things I wanted to ask about is, during this period of time is 
when there's the Exxon Valdez oil spill, and that oil moved out of Prince William Sound westward and 
Renee Purpura, fisherman, Seldovia 
Interviewed by Josh Wisniewski and Marissa Wilson 11/20/2021 
American Folklife Center 
 
 
- 18 - 
came into this area, and I was wondering if you could talk a little bit just what you remember about that 
as sure in the community response to that. Sure. 
 
Renee  1:17:49 
So um, when, um, when the oil spill happened when the Exxon Valdez went up on Bligh Reef, I was 
actually in valleys at that time, because that was, that was Good Friday, that was the end of March in 
1989. And I was over there tagging salmon fry, the Solomon Gulch hatchery. And so it was, it was 
really devastating. Because I was right there. And, you know, everybody was stopping the jobs that 
they were doing to go out and help with the cleanup. And one of the fellows that ran a hatchery, you 
know, they all kind of rub elbows with the oil industry. And they go, oh, well, they'll get that cleaned out. 
That's, that's not an and I go, I have a feeling that it's going to be coming up Cook Inlet, right about the 
time that I'm trying to participate in my fishery is what I said to him. And sure enough, you know, all that 
summer you could tell that the dispersants had been used because you had that that wax that was on 
the surface of the water and all the kelp that you that washed through your nets you could tell it was a 
horrible kelp year  because all of that the kelp was kind of dying off and getting cut loose and you know, 
we you know, they were really scrutinizing the fishery because they didn't want us to have oiled gear 
and have it on our on the product, you know. Meanwhile, in our community, we were really concerned 
about the impact if the, if the big part of the spill came into Kachemak Bay, so the group of us all got 
together to make booms and to try to protect the entrances of our, of our coves and bays. And, you 
know, lots of our community went off to help with the cleanup and it was it was just a really difficult year 
because you know, you could see the impacts on the wildlife and the birds that you would come in 
contact with that you could see were sick and oiled and we were right on the fringes of it.  
The oil was breathing in and out of Cook Inlet on every tide and you know, to this day some of the 
communities or you know, like, especially in Prince William Sound or are dealing with the impacts of it.  
We never really regained our markets in you know, Japan and such, because they went with farm 
reared fish more after that, that summer, and you know, the bottom fell out of our prices, and it was so, 
it was a real eye opener, you know. 
 
Josh Wisniewski  1:21:57 
Josh Wisniewski: I guess the risk that you were at at something like that happening or some other 
human derived environmental impact. 
 
Renee  1:22:08 
Yeah, it was you know, just the fact that it was you know, human error on you know, these large 
tankers that they take in and out of, the Valdez Narrows there and how quickly something like that can 
happen and how horrible it is,  not just not just humans, but the environment and you know.  I don't 
think a lot of people have ever really recovered from that in in some in some areas, you know, 
 
Josh Wisniewski  1:23:03 
I wonder if that raised for people's just feelings their concern or worry about something like that 
happening in Cook Inlet with oil development in the upper part of Cook Inlet, if that became something 
you even started to think about more?

- 19 - 
 
Renee  1:23:18 
Oh, yes. I think that that's on the forefront of a lot of our minds is, you know, that it that it's something 
that doesn't really go hand in hand. You know, there's, there's a cost to it. Not just economically but 
environmentally. You know, we have to have energy and a way to get around but it it's difficult when it's 
right in your backyard. You know, I remember when the George Ferris the oil derrick got stuck in Mud 
Bay years and years ago, and they had to blow the legs off of it to get it loose. That was back in the 70s 
Sometime. And just the residual oil that was on that vessel and you know, what fiasco that was they 
just left it there too long and it they couldn't get it loose. They were just storing it there, you know. 
 
Josh Wisniewski  1:24:45 
And that was at the same time if I remember right, that there was also oil and gas lease sales in in 
Kachemak bay that a lot of people organized to push back against. 
 
Renee  1:24:58 
Yeah, and I think that I think that that that little glitch with that oil derrick really brought it really brought it 
to the kind of the forefront of what might happen if we actually did have lease sales in Kachemak Bay or 
Lower Cook Inlet and what and what the impact of that might be. 
 
Josh Wisniewski  1:25:30 
As you as you talk about that the one of the questions that it brings up for me as having lived here, your 
whole life or some of the other just changes that you've seen in in the local environment. Maybe one 
thing I would ask about it's your what you remember about just kind of the way the fisheries changed 
the shellfish fisheries and then maybe just some of the general changes you've seen that are that you 
observe? 
 
Renee  1:26:00 
Sure. Well, I've seen I've seen a lot of fisheries change in the fact that you know, they were overfished 
you know. We that we were the king crab capital of the world at one time here. And you know, by 1981 
They no longer fish Cook Inlet for king crab. And the Dungeness, I think it was the entire biomass, 
molted on the backside and McDonald Spit in that fall was the last year that they could fish dungies 
because the fisherman targeted so closely as to where the entire biomass of the dungeness were. And, 
you know, the same thing with the shrimp. I mean, they basically they left that industry wipe out the 
entire shrimp population. You know, I think that some of these, some of these species are kind of 
making a bit of a comeback, but I don't know if they're going to allow them to populate enough before 
they start fishing them again. I mean, we're letting people go for personal use on tanners and I don't 
know if they can keep a close enough eye for you know, there's so many more people in Alaska now 
and so many more people that are wanting to consume these wonderful tasty things that if it’ll ever 
really recoup, you know.  I missed the shrimp the most because we have the tastiest shrimp in the 
world right here. They there's just something special about the shrimp, you know, the flavor, the flavor 
of the bay is in it.  it's just, it's just hard to describe.

Josh Wisniewski  1:28:33 
where you able to set shrimp pots yourselves. 
 
Renee  1:28:37 
So when, when I was a girl, my dad and I had a little string of shrimp pots and on the weekends, I think 
we had four or five shrimp pots, we get between a half and a five gallon bucket full of shrimp and take 
them home and we would just eat shrimp until they came out of our ears. And then when we first 
started set netting, there was a fella and I forget his name, but he would come by our set net scow. And 
he would collect all of our flounders and Bullheads and he would bait his pots and we get shrimp back 
from our trash fish that we picked out of the nets. So and so that was that the they were still a bit of a 
personal use for shrimp at that time in the early 80s. But they you know the draggers, the commercial 
fishing boats that they allowed to there was three different distinct species of shrimp, the small pinks 
and the the medium size, the coon stripes and then large spots. And at the end they left. They allowed 
the trawlers to go into Tutka Bay, and Sadie Cove. And they fished out these  spot too because they 
lived deeper in Sadie Cove and Tutka Bay more. 
 
Josh Wisniewski  1:30:23 
I'm sure in the early days of establishing communities here, the Little Tutka community and related that 
having access to those personal use fisheries crab pots and shrimp pots was a pretty important part of 
how people were able to live. 
 
Renee  1:30:41 
Yes, for sure. Yeah. That was the really nice thing is you could you could subsist quite well and lit and 
eat quite well, from the ocean. 
 
Josh Wisniewski  1:31:03 
I was wondering, kind of following that, you know, for you and Robert, and many people, as you 
describe fishing here, it was such a community and a way of life. And I was just wondering what you 
would see as some of the maybe challenges for people trying to get into fishing today, or maybe just 
some of the ways you see it as is different? 
 
 
 
Renee  1:31:29 
Well, I think it's, I think that it's hard to have kind of a grassroots and live that lifestyle anymore. 
Because there's more regulations, I don't think that the DEC is really excited about people living in all of 
these little bays on a float. And so I think it's, it's more regulated than it used to be. I, I think it's more 
expensive to, you know, you can't just go and hang out at a, cabin or, you know, establish yourself 
because the prices for the land itself and, and how expensive it is to get back and, you know, just the 
cost of gas and, and the, the inflation on the, the equipment that you need. And it's I think it's just, I 
think it's just harder, I just, I look at the prices in the grocery store, you know, in the 70s. I mean, 
sometimes you come across, like, we have this historical Homer Facebook page, and some people

saved the you know, the flyers out of the Homer News and what, what the prices, were at Proctors 
Grocery store and it's just, it just boggles your mind. And I know, you know, we were making less 
money and the, you know, the rates of inflation were a little bit different, but it's, it just it, it just appalls 
me at how much it costs to live. And it's, I think it's, I think it's just so much harder to think that you can 
go and, and be off the grid and, and actually make it economically. 
 
Josh Wisniewski  1:34:01 
I was wondering, to like kind of following that up, as you described your life with Robert and fishing, you 
really described it more than anything else as a way of life. Um, and that kind of part of a way of life that 
a lot of people were creating here. And I wonder is you've seen fisheries change if you've seen that part 
change? 
 
Renee  1:34:25 
Yeah, I I don't think that people, I do see families that are involved with the fisheries that that's still think 
of it as a lifestyle and that they, they live to fish, not fish to live. But I just think it's all so much harder, I 
think  in order to be competitive or to, to, to actually, I think you'd really have to embellish your fishing 
habit. You wouldn't necessarily be able to really live like we did. Right and fish right out your front door. 
 
Josh Wisniewski  1:35:33 
That's that was a special rare thing. But yeah, as like how you described living to fish not fishing to live, 
I almost wonder if that would be a model for sustainable fisheries. 
 
Renee  1:35:53 
We'd like to think so. 
 
Josh Wisniewski  1:35:57 
Well, Renee, I just want to thank you so much for taking the time today and sharing your stories in 
history. And it's been wonderful. 
 
Renee  1:36:07 
thank you. Thank you. I enjoyed it. 
 
Josh Wisniewski  1:36:11 
Good. I hope we have more time to go over and look at your pictures more and 
 
Renee  1:36:16 
maybe, maybe hit on some other things. I do feel like I'm kind of a little scattered. 
 
Josh Wisniewski  1:36:25 
No, I don't think so at all.

 Unless there's anything that you feel like, you know, is in the forefront of your mind or heart or 
 
Renee  1:36:35 
No, I think if we if we get together and do a little bit more, I might I might tell a few stories from myself. 
Yeah, 
 
Josh Wisniewski  1:36:49 
We will definitely do that. Thank you so much
