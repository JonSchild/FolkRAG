Words by Mr. Hinny CLIFTON. 
Music by VINCENT SMITII. 
There are times to be merry and times to be sad 
On this changeable earth of ours, 
There's a 
share of the good and a 
share of the Lad, 
In our journey thro' thorns and flow -rs. 
There are parts of the way that are blooming and gay 
There are parts that are stony ground, 
And so it will be I 
can easily see, 
As lone as the world goes round. 
CHORUS. 
As long as the world goes round, 
As long as the world goes round, 
And so it will be I 
can easily see, 
As long as the world goes round. 
Tho' our hearts may grow faint in the battle of life, 
'Tis a 
comfort at least to feel 
That the morrow may bring a 
new turn to the strife, 
In a turning of fortune's wheel, 
Tho' the sky be o'ercast, there is sunshine at last, 
Where the blackest of clouds are found, 
And so it will be I 
can easily see 
As long as the world goes round. 
As long as the world, dsc 
Let us bow to the sorrows fate throws in our way, 
There is hope when its frowns are worst ; 
And enjoy the bright weather of life while we may, 
For to-morrow the storm will burst. 
Seize the best when you cam bear the worst like a 
man 
'Tis a 
motto both safe and sound. 
And so it will be I 
can easily see, 
As long as the world goes round. 
As long as the world, dte

THE HOUSEKEEPER'S WOES. 
By H. A. PECHTER. 
[The Music of this piece, arranged for the voice and the pianoforte, 
is published in De Witt's Half Dime Series of Choice Music. For cola 
by R. M. Ds Wrrr, 33 Rose Street. Price Five cents•I 
Now, my dear friends, I 
pray that you will listen, 
The truth you will certainly find in -my lines ; 
It's all about what the poor housekeeper suffers, 
A 
tug with the dirt, takes the whole blessed time. 
One day in my rambles I 
heard a 
complaining, 
And saw a 
poor woman the picture of gloom; 
She glared at the mud on her door step, ('twas raining,) 
And this was her wail as she wielded her broom: Lliepeat. 
"This life is a 
toil, and love is a 
trouble, 
And beauty wilt fade and riches will flee; 
And pleasures they dwindle and prices they double, 
And nothing is what I 
could wish it to be. 
There's too much of worriment goes to a 
bonnet, 
There's too much of ironing goes to a 
shirt; 
There's nothing that pays for the time you waste on it, 
There's nothing that lasts us but trouble and dirt. 
[1] 
THE HOUSEKEEPERS WOES.—f 
comma% 
"In March it is mud, and it's slush in December, 
The midsummer breezes are loaded with dust; 
In Fall the leaves litter, in muggy September. 
The wall-paper rots and the candlesticks rust. 
There are worms in the cherries and slugs in the roses, 
And ants in the sugar and mice in the pies; 
And rubbish of spiders no mortal supposes, 
And ravaging roaches, and damaging flies. 
" 
It's sweeping at six and it's dusting at seven, 
It's victuals at eight and it's dishing at nine; 
It's potting and panning from ten to eleven, 
We scarce break our fast ere we plan how to dine. 
With grease and with grime from corner to center, 
Forever at war and forever alert; 
No rest for a 
day lest the enemy enter, 
I 
spend my whole life in a 
struggle with dirt. 
"Last night, in my sleep, I 
was stationed forever 
On a 
bare little isle in the midst of the sea; 
My one chance of life was a 
ceaseless endeavor 
To sweep off the waves ere they swept off poor me. 
Alas, 'twas a 
dream—again I 
behold it, 
cease—I 
am helpless my fate to avert I" 
She rolled down her sleeves, and her apron she folded, 
And ha. down and died, and was buried in dirt.

THE DAYS OF GLORIOUS WASHINGTON., 
Words by J. F. 
POOLE. 
Music by J. N. Sroam. 
In the days of glorious Washington, 
A long time ago, 
Our fathers true a 
Union made, 
To last through weal or woe ; 
The constitution then they frani'd, 
The charter ot the free ; 
And said the home of liberty, 
Columbia e'er should be. 
For to maintain the Union then 
True patriot blood did flow, 
In the days of glorious Washington 
A long time ago. 
In the days of glorious Washington; 
A long time ago. 
But years went by, peace ruled the land:, 
And then came wars alarms ; 
Columbia's tocsin sounded loud 
To call her sons to arms; 
And quickly they obeyed the call 
From city, hill, and lea. 
Once more they met the haughty foe 
And drove them o'er the sea. 
For to maintain the Union then 
They fought and beat the foe, 
In glorious Andrew Jackson's days, 
A long time ago. 
In glorious Andrew Jackson's days, 
A long time ago. 
Time spread apace, our country grew, 
And Freedom bless'd our shore; 
The thirteen stars upon our flag 
Now numbered thirty-four ; 
But traitors raise rebellions hands 
And dare its in the field, 
Our half a 
million gallant men, 
Will SOOTI make treason yield. 
The Union has victorious been, 
And ever shall be so. 
While brave Ulyses takes the field 
To lay rebellion low. 
While brave Ulyses takes the field 
To lay rebellion low.

"KEEP TO THE RIGHT.' 
Words by 'U REA' LINN. 
Music by ROLAND H OWARD; 
One day while walking thro' the streets, amidst a 
busy throng, 
Studying and musing on a 
subject for my song, 
A board nail'd to a corner, it quickly caught my sight, 
And painted there I 
saw the warning, 
Keep to the right," 
cfiOuus. 
Love whate'er 19 right, boys, shun whate'er is wrong, 
Then upon life's billows you'll go merrily along, 
Be honest in your dealings, morning, noon, and night, 
And let your watchword always he, boys, keep to the right. 
Keep a 
smiling countenance, never wear a 
frown, 
Do not try to raise yourself by pulling others down, 
Envy not your neighbor, ne'er indulge in spite, 
Malice brings unhappiness, so keep to the right. 
Love whate'er is right, boys, & c. 
Be sober and industrions, ambitious to get on, 
For in life's unequal battle you must struggle hard and strong, 
In gossiping or meddling, never take delight, 
Always mind your own affairs. and keep to the right. 
Love whate'er is right, boys, &c. 
Keep to the right then, how happy you will be, 
Your heart will be as light as air, your conscience pure and free, 
Behind the darkest cloud, the sun is always shining bright, 
Prosperity will crown you if you keep to the right. 
Love whate'er is right, boys, &c.

'TWAS RANK AND FAME THAT TEMPTED 
THEE. 
By M. W. BALFE. From the " Rose of Castile." 
'Twas rank and fame that tempted thee, 
'Twas empire charm'd thy heart; 
But love was wealth, the world to me, 
Then, false one, let us part. 
The prize I 
fondly deetu'd my own, 
Another's now may be; 
For ah! with love life's gladness flown, 
Leaves grief alone, alone to me, 
Leaves grief alone, to me. 
With love life's gladness flown 
Leaves grief alone to me. 
Lowly bred and humbly born, 
No loftier heart than mine; 
Unlov'd by thee, my pride would scorn 
To share the crown that's thine. 
I 
sought no empire save the heart, 
Which mine can never be; 
Then false one, we for ever part, 
Since love lives not, lives not in thee. 
Since love lives not in thee, 
Yes I 
false one, better part, 
Since love lives not in thee. 
DO A GOOD TURN WHEN YOU CAN. 
Words by CHARLES SWAIN. 
Music by S. NaLsoN. 
It needs not great wealth a 
kind heart to display ; 
If the hand be but willing it soon finds a 
way, 
And the poorest one yet, in the humblest abode, 
May help a 
poor brother a 
step on his road. 
Oh, whatever the fortune a 
man may have won, 
A 
kindness depends on the way it is done; 
And though poor be our purse, and though narrow our span, 
Let us all try to do a 
good turn when we can. 
Let us all try, let us all try, 
Let us all try to do a 
good turn when we can. 
The fair bloom of pleasure may charm for awhile, 
But its beauty is frail, and inconstant its smiles; 
Whilst the beauty of kindness, immortal in bloom, 
Sheds a 
sweetness o'er life and a 
grace o'er the toirb; 
Then if we enjoy life, why the next thing to do, 
Is to see that another enjoys his life too; 
And though poor be our purse, and though narrow our span, 
Let us all try to do a 
good turn when we can. 
Let us all try, let us all try, 
Let us all try to do a 
good turn when we can.

l'm sadly out of spirits, for I 
m out of luck, you see, 
Dame Fortune, that uncertain jade, has turned her back on me; 
Some men are born with silver spoons, I've oft heard people 
state, 
I 
fear the spoons that fell to me, were but electroplate; 
I 
recollect in childhood's days, when pretty toys I 
sought, 
;They told me,I must wait, until my ship came into port,— 
how hopefully I 
waited then, now comfortless I 
roam,— 
Perhaps things will be better when my ship comes home. 
CHORUS. 
When my ship comes home, boys, when my ship comes home, 
Like a 
jolly fellow thro' the world I'll roam ; 
When my ship comes home, boys, when my ship comes home, 
I 
mean to de some wonders when my ship comes home. 
'17lien childhood pass'd and youth appear'd, the dawn of man_ 
hood fair, 
long'd so for that ship, and built my castles in the air; 
What boon companions I 
would choose, what dinners I 
would 
give, 
What horses I 
would drive, and oh I 
in what a 
style I'd live I 
The world would not be large enough' for all the good I'd do, 
When once that visionary ship of mine oppeared to view; 
-"Alisfortune's gales, though, kept her back or sunk her in the foam 
And I 
am weary waiting till my ship comes home. 
When my ship comes home, boys, dzc. 
The years go swiftly by, for time is speedy in his flight, 
And not a 
vestige of the ship has yet appeared in sight 
The higher that one's hopes are raised the greater is the fall,— 
It will he hard indeed if she does not come home at all ; 
If friendly wind's should waft her here to me with wealth galore 
My heart will still be found tis true as in the days of yore-
No willirig man shall want for work, notapenniless shall roam, 
You see I'm only waiting till my ship comes home. 
When my ship conies home, boys, dm.

IT'S NAUGHTY, BUT IT'S NICE.—[CONCLUDEL 1 
Last night I 
called at Westbourne Grove, 
And asked if she would go 
A 
walk, and we would talk of love; 
At first she answered, " No I" 
Then consented, and we walked and talked— 
I 
thought it paradise,— 
But she said 'twas wrong ; I 
answered,— 
Well, it's naughty, but it's nice.—Cno. 
I 
put my arm around her waist, 
Tier form I 
gently pressed; 
And then she laid her lovely face 
Upon my manly chest. 
I 
kiss'd her two times on the cheek, 
I 
would have kissed her thrice, 
But I 
whispered, Ain't it naughty! 
She said, Yes, but it's so nice.—Ono. 
To-day she asked if she might wed, 
Her ma exclaimed, My dear! 
You must not think of marrying Fred 
For many and many a 
year : 
It's wicked, miss, your pa and ma 
And home to sacrifice. 
To get married—well, I 
know, said she, 
It's naughty, but it's nice. 
Cuo.—If you think marriage wicked, ma, 
You're guilty of that vice; 
You perhaps may call it naughty, 
But you also know it's nice. 
Her parents have consented, and 
In two years she will be 
My wife; so now you know my tale: 
I 
hope you will give to me 
The same applause, that from you all 
So often I 
entice; 
It's naughty p'rhaps to ask it, 
But to get it is so nice.—Ono.

MANY A TIME AND OFT. 
Words by A.

Music by J. 
F. 
DUGGAN. 
When the house is still, and the day is done, 
And the stars are out aloft, 
.1 sit by the failing fire alone, 
And dream of the days that are past and gone, 
Many a 
time, many a 
time and oft I 
I 
dream of that village beside the sea, 
dream of that seat by the trysting tree, 
And of one who will never come back to me, 
Never conic back to me. 
Then the city is husli'd and the chimes are still, 
And the voice of the crowd is soft; 
And the thoughts wander on at their own wild wil 
And my tears fall fast, and niy heart is chill, 
Many a 
time, many a 
time and oft 
I 
dream of the hopes that are faded and fled, 
Of the vow that is broken, the shaft that is sped, 
And of one to whom I 
forever am dead, 
Forever, forever am dead. 
'TWAS LIKE A SPIRIT'S SIGH. 
By W. F. 
TAYLOR. 
I 
wander'd forth one summer eve, 
My thoughts with gloom o'ercast; 
I 
sat me down beneath the trees, 
And thought of days long past. 
When suddenly a 
gentle sound. 
Seem'd floating in the leaves: 
So soft, ' twas like a 
spirit's sigh, 
Borne on the evening breeze. 
And ever on my memory, 
Doti' dwell that gentle sound ; 
It cheers rue to my onward task, 
When all is dark around. 
For oh that sweet JEolian sound, 
That seem'd among the leaves; 
Was like the voice of her that's gone, 
Borne on the evening breeze.

THE HAPPY MULETEER.. 
From the " Crown Diamonds" by AUBER. 
Oe'r mountain steep thro' vallies roaming, 
How happy is the Muleteer 
Oe'r mountain steep time' vallies roaming, 
How happy is the Muleteer. 
With joyous heart, with jocund song, 
From blush of day to twilight grey 
Laughing winds he his way along, 
The merry happy Muleteer, 
The merry happy Muleteer, 
At vine clad door a 
welcome guest; 
By toil subdued how calm his rest 
By toil subdued how calm his rest. 
Fading grandeur dreams of splendor, 
Build no rainbow castle in his breast, 
Thoughts of home there in are dear. 
Oe'r mountain steep thro' vallies roaming 
How happy is the limeteer, 
O'er mountain steep thro' vallies roaming 
How happy is the Muleteer 
Oh happy happy Muleteer 
Oh happy happy Muleteer. 
His native vale where flow'rs are blooming 
Enchants alone the Muleteer. 
Ills native vale where flow'rs are blooming 
Enchants alone the Muleteer. 
His rustic home, his lovely bride, 
Their heart's best joy the smiling boy 
Shunb'ring tranquilly by her side 
These delight the Muleteer, 
These delight the Muleteer. 
For them he braves the mountain way, 
The wolf by night the storm by day, 
The wolf by night the storm by day, 
Halls of splendor, dreams of grandeur 
Never lead his manly heart astray, 
Thoughts of home alone are dear. 
O'er mountain steep thro' vallies roaming 
flow happy is the Muleteer, 
O'er mountain steep thro' vallies roaming 
flow happy is the Muleteer. 
Oh happy happy Muleteer

KEEP YOUR POWDER DRY. 
Words by HENRY B. FARNIE. 
Music by D. GODFREY. 
Of all the lessons of the past, 
The one I 
like the most, 
Fell from our stout old Oliver, 
When Round- heads ruled the roast ! 
He wore a 
bible in his pouch, 
A 
sword upon his thigh, 
And lads, he cried, trust heav'n above, 
But keep your powder dry ! 
But keep your powder dry 1 
And lads, he cried, trust heav'n above. 
But keep your powder dry! 
Yes ! keep your powder dry, boys, 
Keep your powder dry, 
No prating poll was fine old Noll, 
So keep your powder dry 
O'er the battle field of life, 
Be careful as you go, 
For people are so civilized, 
One can't tell friend from foe! 
Take smile and pressure of the hand, 
For what they're worth, say I, 
But all the same, remember you, 
To keep your powder dry 1 
To keep your powder dry ! 
But, all the same, remember you 
To keep your powder dry I 
Yes, keep your powder dry, boys, 
Keep your powder dry, 
If false th' alarm there is no harm, 
But keep your powder dry! 
Union still is like old Noll, 
(Albeit unawares,) 
For girt with bibles and with sword, 
She conquers, but she spares I 
No man can love the Olive branch, 
Nor hate war more than I, 
But if we want peace, why we must 
Just keep our powder dry ! 
Just keep our powder dry ! 
But if we want peace, why, we ! Lust 
Just keep our powder dry ! 
Yes, keep our powder dry, boys, 
Keep our powder dry, 
'Tis good the foe should always know, 
We keep our powder dry ! 
JUDGE NOT A MAN BY HIS CLOTHING.

Judge not a 
man by the cost of his clothing, 
Unheeding the life path that he may pursue; 
Or oft you'll admire a 
heart that needs loathing, 
And fail to give honor w 
here honor is due. 
The palm may be hard, and the fingers stiff-jointed, 
The coat may be tattered, the cheek worn with tears; 
ep 
But greater than kings are labors

You can't judge a 
man by the coat that i.e wears. 
Give me the man as a 
friend and a 
neighbor, 
Who toils at the loom, with the spade or the plough ; 
Who wins his diploma of manhood by labor, 
And purchases wealth by the sweat of his brow. 
Why should the broadcloth alone be respected, 
And the man be despised who in fustian appears ; 
While the angels in heaven have their limbs unp. otected [
Repeat. 
You can't judge a 
man by the coht that he wears. 
Judge of a 
man by the work he is doing, 
Speak of a 
man as his actions demand ; 
Watch well the path that each is pursuing, 
And let the most worthy be chief of the land I 
And that man shall be found 'mid the close ra-ks of labor, 
Be known by the work that his industry rears ; 
And the chiefdom when won shall be dear to his neighbor,[ikpeat. 
And we'll honor the man whatever be wears.

THE OLD ENGLISH SQUIRE. 
By R. STEIRLY. 
The Music of this Song is published by E. 
H. 
HARDING, 288 Bowery. 
Price 10 Cents. 
About fifty years ago when George the Third was King, 
The Prince the star of fashion, btightly shone in pleasures ring ; 
Eiv'd a 
good old English Squire, a 
man of great renown, 
he'd an old hail in the Country, and a 
modern house in town. 
A 
justice of the peace he was and also an M. P., 
Was fetter'd to no pa , 
ty, in his principles was free; 
lie courted not the Premier, his sons were in the Guards, 
With Fox ho sometimes voted, but much oft'uer play'd at Cards. 
He kept a 
stud of racers, 'twas his joy to see them run, 
• 
His side boards were well cover'd with the Gold cups they had won ; 
To the town lie represented ev'ry year he gave a 
plate, 
And to the course in coach and six he always drove in state. 
Six goodly nags they were forsooth, tho' very fat and slow, 
Their manes well deck'd with ribbons and their flowing tails also; 
His lady sat beside him, tall and upright as a 
wand, 
The people loudly cheer'd them as they lighted at the stand. 
He kept a 
pack of fox hounds of the pure old English breed, 
Eight musical and staunch they were,tho' not much fa in'd for speed; 
his hunters were enduring, and could go a 
decent pace, 
To suit his hounds he bred them, not to run a 
steeple chase. 
lie boldly (lasted o'er hedge and ditch, nor stood at gate or brook. 
And many a 
Melton Mowbray swell would shy the leaps he took; 
'T was a 
pleasant sight to see him thro' a 
bound fence make a 
gap, 
With his hairjust like a 
drum stick, sticking out behind his Cap. 
On the first day of September, as the season it came round, 
The Squire in the stubble, with his pointers might be found; 
Ilis gun was like a 
musket, an old fashioned flint and steel, 
Wide muzzled and a 
kicker, she was heavy in the heel. 
But birds they being plentiful, he brought down many a 
brace, 
.And if he caught them sitting he showed them little grace; 
Talk of shooting flying, about fifty years ago, 
Kill when you can was then the plan but trust to shooting low. 
His rent day was at Michaelmas, beneath the old ork 
Where portraits, arms,and horns of deer bedeck'd each panerd wau.; 
'Twas his Custom and a 
good one, with his tenantry to dine, 
And the first toast that he gave, was in a 
gold cup flint with wine. 
Old claret rich and sparkling. such as seldom tasted now, 
"1' was the King and Royal Family and God speed the plough ; 
Amen ; exclaimed the V car, his patron seated near, 
The Farmers drank their bumpers off and gave a 
hearty cheer. 
About thirty years an-o, the time I 
well remember 
A dark and dreary day in the cold month of November ; 
This good old Country Sqoire, aged three score years and ten, 
Was ga heed to his Fathers, to the grief of all good men. 
In thevii lage Church he's buried, scarce a 
mile from the old Hall, 
Ilis heir he was chief mourner. six old neighbors bore his pall ; 
Ills memory still is cherished and many people say. 
With this good old Country Squire good old times have pass'd away.

Upon the stormy seas; 
I've seen some twenty banners float

The boast of England's tars, 
Yet none could thrill my heart like thee, 
My Country's Flag of Stars.

My Country's Flag of Stars. 
But thy bright azure fold is pure, 
My Country's Flag of Stars. 
In some fam'd foreign port I've seen 
The ships of half the world, 
To celebrate some gala day. 
Their bunting all unfurl'd. 
With eager heart, I've glanced my eye

My Country's Flag of Stars.

One spark of freedom's zeal,

Oh, dear me! these are trouble= t 
mes, 
There really is no seem' 
Which is the best locality 
" 
To be or not to be in." 
Tax gatherers stand on ev'ry hand, 
With arms outstretched to collar 414; 
And take away our dimes, by means 
Of which our miens are Dolorous. 
CHORUS. 
And it's oh! dear, oh! 
We're all going up in a 
Balloon 
As high as we can go. 
On ev'ry side there seems to glide 
A spirit of dejection; 
To think the only food that's cheap 
Is food for our reflection. 
But if things should much higher go, 
To reach them we'll be flustered; 
For we'll only just be " wor:h our salt," 
When all our funds are Mustered. 
And it's oh! dear, oh! &e. 
But our consciences are getting seared, 
Each day we grow more callous; 
Our gals are all less buoyous, 
And our boys all more gallus. 
And that the wife, to husband her supplies, 
Finds it. bewilderin' 
Whilst the father finds his " Undo" 
Is apparent to the Children. 
And it's oh! dear, oh ! &c. 
There's not a 
business in the laud 
But of the times afraid is ; 
And even Hackney Coachmen say 
It's at a 
stand their trade is. 
And milkmen, when we ask for cream, 
All tell us we must stop a 
bit; 
Because the milk has " riz " so high 
The cream can't get—atop of it. 
And it's oh I 
dear, oh! & c. 
The Butchers' trade is out of joint, 
He's cut up past revealing; 
And half inclined to drown himself, 
And sink the awful feeling. 
Chopfallen thus the Stak& to lose 
his " rib " grows spare and lender; 
With " heaps " of little tender loins 
But nsry legal tender. 
And it's oh! dear, oh &es 
The Baker rolls his eyes, and twists 
His bead at doleful " Clackers ;" 
But never in his fancy bred 
Such times as these for Crackers. 
And tho' he's not a 
loafer, 
To a 
sponge he's fast seceeding; 
For he finds that oftener than his dough 
It is a 
friend he's needing. 
And it's oh I 
dear, oh! &C. 
Shoemakers say ( poor sou/8) it's bootless 
To attempt a 
living; 
They know their all won't last till 
"Dead men's shoes" relief are giving. 
The Doctors lose their patience 
And for physic— they might make it; 
And " throw it to the Dogs," but well 
They know the dogs wonAlutta
ikie
vsito. 
h! dear,oh I &Ct. 
They've taxed our stages and our cars, 
Our steamboats on our rivers; 
They've taxed our lights, and probably 
They mean to tax our livers. 
And Washington Miss Nancy's, 
With their single eye, it may be; 
Will tax our wives, or make us get 
A license for a—Baby. 
And it's oh! dear, oh I & O. 
But where's the use of grumbling 
At the fiddler or the fifer; 
When it's well known that all who dance 
Must surely pay the piper. 
So let's support the Government, 
And cry, " Long live the President ;" 
Thankful, as yet no income tax 
Debars an Alms House resident. 
And it's oh! dear, oh! &is.

WORDS TO REMEMBER. 
By E3IIL STADLER. 
The Mush of this Song is published by E. H. HA 
RDING, 228 Bowery, 
Price 1U Cents. 
Words to remember are those that are spoken 
From lips that are breathing the tones of the heart 
Cherish'd like vows that are not to be broken 
These front our memories ne'er should depart. 
The voice of the stranger may charm for a 
season, 
The song of the syren the moment may please; 
Btu the words of a 
friend breathing love wed to reason 
Words to remember and cherish are these. 
Words to remember are those that are plighted 
When young hearts are blending their earliest vows; 
For hearts like the flow'rs of spring may be blighted 
And drop like the blossoms that fall from the boughs ; 
But time cannot alter the voice of affection, 
Though seasons may change both the flowers and the trees; 
For youthful love tones amid joy and dejection, 
Words to remember and cherish are these.

Now the summer's sunny gladness, 
Ilath faded all away 
And there breathes a 
tone of sadness 
In Autumn's lin Ong day, 
But I 
heed not change of season, 
All cheerless tho' it be, 
For the heart can feel but summer 
Whene'er I 
think of thee 
Whene'er I 
think of thee, love, 
Whene'er I 
think of thee, 
Oh, the heart can feel but summer 
Whene'er I 
think of thee. 
Well we know Autumn changes, 
To winter's biting storm. 
That o'er heart, and blossom ranges, 
To wither and deform 
But I 
heed not winter's raving, 
Tho' black its stcrms may be 
In this heart is summer's sweetness, 
Whene'er I 
think of thee 
Whene'er I

WItene'er I

Oh this heart feels summer's sweetness 
Whene'er I

THE SEA-RING'S BURIAL. 
W ords by CHARLES MACKAY. 
Music by HENRY RUSSEL: 
My strength is failing fast, 
Said the sea king to his men ; 
I 
shell never sail the seas 
Like a 
conqueror again, 
But while a 
drop yet remains 
Of the life blood in my veins, 
Raise, oh, raise me from my bed, 
Put my crown upon my head, 
Put my sword in my hand, 
And so lead me to the strand, 
Where my ship at anchor rides; steadily, steadily, 
If I 
cannot end my life, 
In the glorious battle strife, 
Let me die as I 
have lived; 
Let me die, let me die on the sea. 
They have borne him to the ship 
With a 
slow and solemn tread ; 
They have placed him on the deck 
With his crown upon his head, 
And in the hold beneath 
Lit the slow sure fire of death; 
There was music in her sails, 
As they spread them to the gales, 
And a 
dashing at her prow, 
As she cleft the waves below, 
And he rais'd his voice exulting I 
gallantly, gallantly, 
The life is in me yet, 
And the courage to forget, 
All my pain in my triumph, 
All my pain in my triumph on the sea. 
Once alone a 
cry arose 
Half of anguish, half of pride, 
As he sank upon the deck 
With the flames on ev'ry side, 
" 
I 
am coming," said the king, 
" 
Where the sword and bucklers ring," 
And of bolder warrior born, 
Nought remained at break of morn, 
Of the chared and blackn'd hull, 
But some ashes and a 
skull, 
And still the vessel drifted heavily, beavil 
With a 
pale and hazy light 
Until far into the night, 
When she founder'd in the silence, 
When she founder'd in the silence of the sea. 
ALL FOR MONEY. 
What will not most people do,

TAKE BACK THE HEART THAT THOU GAVEST. 
. 
Words by IfoN. Mrs. G. R. GIFForm. 
Music by CLAMBEL. 
Take back the heart that thou gayest, 
1Vhat is ray anguish In thee ? 
Take back the freedom thou cravest, 
Leaving the fetters to me. 
Take back the vows thou host spoken, 
Fling them asi(:e and be free, 
Smile o'er each pitiful token, 
Leaving the sorrow to me. 
Drink deep of life's fond illusion, 
Gaze on the storm cloud, and flee 
E;wiftly Oro' strife and confusion, 
Leaving the burden to me. 
• 
Then when at last overtaken, 
Time flings its fetters o'er thee, 
Come, with a 
trust still unshaken, 
Come back a 
captive to me, 
Come back in sadness or sorrow, 
Once more my darling to be, 
Come, as of old, love, to borrow 
Glimpses of sunlight from me. 
Love shall resume its dominion, 
Striving no more to be free, • 
When on the world weary pinion, 
Flies back my lost love to me. 
THE ANCHOR'S WEIGH'D. 
By BRAIIAM. 
The tear fell gently from her eye, 
When last we parted on the shore, 
My bosom beat with many a 
sigh, 
To think I 
ne'er might see her more, 
To think I 
ne'er might see her more ; 
"Dear youth she cried, and can'st thou baste away, 
My heart will break, a 
little moment stay, 
Alas I 
cannot, I 
cannot part from thee, 
The Anchor's weigli'd, the Anchor's weigh'd, 
Farewell ! farewell I 
remember me. 
" 
Weep not my love," I 
trembling said, 
"Doubt not a 
constant heart like mine 
I 
ne'er can meet another maid, 
Whose charms can fix a 
heart like mine 
Whose charms can fix a 
heart like mine!" 
Go then," she cried, " but let thy constant mind, 
Oft think of her you leave in tears behind ; 
Dear maid, this last embrace my pledge shall be, 
The Anchor's weigli'd, the Anchor's weigh'd, 
Farewell! farewell ! rdmember me. 
WRECKED AND SAVED. 
Words by J. BENDAHL.—Music by W. KNOWLES 
The day was fair, the sun was bright, 
Our ship so gaily dresa'd, 
All hearts were bounding with delight, 
Not one with fear oppress'd. 
The anchor weigli'd, each sail was spread 
To catch the freslfning breeze, 
And on our way we swiftly sped, 
Upon the boundh•ss seas. 
But soon a 
dreadful storm began, 
The livid light'ning flash'd, 
The troubled seas like mountains ran, 
The troubled seas like mountains ran, 
The troubled seas like mountains ran, 
And loud the thunder crash'd. 
The raving waters swept the deck 
And shiver'd ey'ry mast, 
All sails were gone, the ship a wreck. 
And down- ward sinking fast. 
Our Captain calm, sercine his brow, 
The fearful sentence gave, 
"We're lost, no pow')' can help as now, 
The sea must be our grave." 
E'en then we wept not in despair 
Tho' hope of life had flown, 
But rais'd one voice in holy prep, 
To Heavn's benignant throne. 
The last farewell, the last good-bye 
We gave, for death seemed near. 
When ho ! a 
sail, a 
ship comes nigh. 
Thank God, thank God, thine aid is near. 
Hurrah we're say'd now homeward bound. 
The ship speeds on amain. 
Soon shall our joyous shout resound 
In England once again. 
Hurrah ! we're say'd, now homeward bound 
The ship speeds on amain. 
Soon shall our joyous shout resound 
in England once again.

'Neath the village oak sat an old man worn, 
Leaning his hand on his tru-ty staff, 
lie was silent and sad on that beauteous morn, 
Till rais'd by the sound of a 
child-like laugh ; 
He raised his head and smiled, while a 
tear, 
CourAl gently down o'er his furrowed cheek, 
And the wondering child sought his grief to cheer, 
As he stroked the hand of that old. man meek. 
Sit down, my child, by thy grandsire's side, 
And he passed his hand through his golden hair, 
"While he smiled in the zest of an old man's pride 
O'er his childish form so blithe and fair; 
It led him back to his boyhood's days, 
When his arm was strong, and his laugh was free, 
E'er the storm had sprinkled his locks with grey 
Or he tempted the waves of the treach'rous sea.

How he wandered afar but found no balm, 
Through the weary course of many a

Till years brought age and age a

tear, 
Se the old man's eyes are closed in sleep 
And the visions change in his slumbers, now, 
For gentle smiles o'er his features creep 
Like the vaiied hues of the rain's brio-lit bow 
But never more shall the old man dream 
By the village tree of the days of yore, 
For his soul went out with the sun's last beam 
And his anchor is cast on the safe lea shore.

By the fierce red light of his furnace bright, 
The strokes of the hammer rung. 
And he lifted high his brawny hand 
On the iron glowing clear ; 
And the sparks rushed out in scarlet rout, 
As he fashioned the sword and spear. 
And sang hurrah ! for my handiwork, 
Hurrah ! for the spear and the sword, 
Hurrah for the hand that shall wield them well, 
For he shall be King and Loyd. 
To Tubal Cain came many a 
one, 
As he wrought by his roaring fire ; 
And each one prayed for a 
strong steel blade, 
As the crown of his desire. 
And he made them weapons sharp and strong, 
Till they shouted loud for glee ; 
And gave him gifts of pearls and gold, 
And spoils of the forest free. 
And they sang Hurrah ! for Tuba' Cain, 
Who hath given us strength anew ; 
Hurrah for the smith! hurrah for the fire, 
And hurrah ! for the metal trete. 
But a 
sudden change came o'er his head, 
Ere the setting of the sun ; 
And Tubal Cain was filled with pain, 
For the evil he had done. 
He saw the men, with rage and hate, 
Made war upon their kind ; 
[1] 
/11 
TUBAL CAIN.—[CoNcLunsn.1 
And the land was red with the blood they tilled, 
In their lust for carnage blind. 
And he said, " Alas ! that ever I 
made, 
Or that skill of mine should plan; 
The spear and sword for men whose joy 
Is to slay their fellow man." 
And for many a 
day old Tubal Cain 
Sat brooding o'er his woe; 
And his hand forbore to smite the ore, 
And his furnace smouldered low. 
But he rosa at last with a-cheerful face, 
And a 
bright courageous eye; 
And bared his strong right arm for work, 
While the quick flames mounted high. 
And he sang, " Hurrah for my handiwork," 
And the red sparks lit the air— 
" 
Not alone for the blade was the bright steel made,' 
And he fashioned the first ploughshare. 
And men, taught wisdom from the past, 
In friendship joined their hands; 
Hung the sword in the hall, the spear on the wall, 
And ploughed the willing lands. 
And sang hurrah! for Tubal Cain, 
Our staunch good friend is he; 
And for the ploughshare and the plough 
To him our praise shall be. 
But while oppression rears its head, 
Or tyrant would be lord; 
Though we may thank him for the plough, 
Well not forget t14(t sword.

MAN IN THE MOON. 
When a 
bumper is ordered, 'tis vexing no doubt, 
To find when you fill that the wine is run out , 
And ' tis surely an equally unpleasant thing. 
To be asked for a 
song when you've nothing to sing. 
Night try something old, if an old one would do, 
But the world is still craving to have something new; 
And what to select for the words or the tune, 
I 
in fact know no more than the man in the moon; 
Al ! 
the man in the moon a 
new light on we throws, 
Ile's a 
man we all talk of but nobody knows, 
And though a 
high subject, I'm getting in tune; 
I'll just have a 
turn at the man in the moon. 
The man in the moon seems to lead a 
queer life, 
With no one about him, not even a 
wife: 
No friends to console him, no children to kiss 
No chance of his joining a 
meeting like this. 
His changing his lodging each quarter's unpleasant, 
Living first in a 
circus, and then in a 
crescent, 
If be rents by these quarters, so fast going by, 
I 
should fancy he's rented uncommonly high, 
But he's used to high life, for all circles agree 
None are moving in such a 
high circle as he— 
For tho' nobles go up in a 
royal balloon, 
They can't get introduced to the man in the moon. 
'Tis thought that all madmen are moostruck we find, 
And the man in the moon may be out of Ids mind, 
But it can't be for love, for ' Lis very well known, 
There's no girls there to meet him by moonnlight alone. 
It can't be ambition, for rivals he's none, 
At least he is only eclipsed by the sun ; 
Though his prospects are often o'er clouded he sees, 
But the man in the moon can make light of all these. 
In drinking, I 
fear, he may somewhat surpass. 
For he always looks best when he's seen through a 
glass. 
Then for smoking, though we may smoke morning awl noon, 
We can't blow a 
cloud like the man in the moon. 
He's a 
mighty sad rake, he don't rise till it's dark , 
When the night it sets in he sets out for a 
lank. 
Goes mooning about and sings out to the sphere.,, 
We won't go home till morning, till day-light appears, 
Ho looks in at the stars that go shooting up there, 
And lets loose the dog star to bait the great bear. 
At the Milkv-way stops for a 
minute or two, 
itas some milk, but don't. pay, 'cos he swears it's sky blue. 
I;ut daylight soon takes the shine out, of him quite, 
And he goes home, and gets into bed by sunlight., 
And 44-sough you tniry think him a 
regular spoon,. 
You'd be plagued to -
get over the man in the tnecin. 
-PH(EBE, DEAREST. 
Plicebe, dearest, tell, oh I 
tell me, 
My I 
hope that you'll be mine, 
Oh! let no cold froovn repel me, 
Leave me not in grief to pine. 
Tho' tis told in homely fashion, 
Pincebe, trust the tale I 
tell, 
Ne'er was truer, inurer passion, 
Than within this heart doth dwell, 
Long I've watched each rare perfection, 
Stealing o'er that gentle brow, 
Till respect became affection, 
Such as that 1 
other now. 
If you love me and will have me, 
;I'rue I'll be in weal or woe; 
If in cold disdain you leave me, ' 
For a 
soldier I 
will go. 
Little care the broken-hearted, 
What their fate in life may be ; 
PiKebe, if we once are parted, 
Once for ever it will be. 
Say, then, yes, or blindly, madly, 
I 
will rush upon the foe, 
And will welcome, oh, how gladly 
Shot and shell that lays me low. 
NIAD E
IN 
I 
dream of thee, sweet Madoline, 
So beautiful and bright, 
My memory weaves each look of thine 
With ey'ry thought or light. 
Thou art the music of my heart, 
That whisper's through each (lay, 
That speaks tiny name in ey'ry breeze, 
When far from thee away. 
I 
dream of thee, tte 
I 
dream of thee, dear Madoline, 
Through life's sad waste or years ; 
Like spring's sweet breath to flowers that droop, 
Thy smiling; face appears. 
Whone'er the world may cast his care, 
When Si ii

I 
fear no shade, for in my grief,

Come out—'tis now September, 
The hunter's moon begun ; 
And through the wheaten stubble, 
Is heard the frequent gun. 
The leaves are paling yellow, 
Or kindling into red ; 
And the ripe and golden barley 
Is hanging down its head. 
All among the barley who would not be blithe, 
When the free and happy barley is smiling on the scythe ? 
The Spring she is a 
young maid, 
That does not know her mind. 
The Summer is a 
tyrant 
Of most unrighteous kind ; 
The Autumn is an old friend 
That loves one all he can, 
And that brings the happy barley 
To glad the heart of man. 
All among the barley, who would not be blythe 
When the free and happy barley is smiling on the scythe ? 
The wheat is like a 
rich mutt, 
That's sleek and well to do ; 
Th e oats are like a.pack of girls, 
Laughing and dancing too. 
The rye is like a 
miser, 
That's sulky, lean, and small; 
But the free and bearded barley, 
Is the monarch of them all. 
All among the barley who would not he blythe, 
When he '
free ai;(1 happy barley is smiling on the scythe ?

OH, AND HE LOVED ME DEARLY. 
There was a 
young man came a 
courting of me— 
Singing, Oh I 
my dear, and I 
love you dearly, 
The nicest young man as ever I 
did see, 
Singing, Oh ! and I 
love you so dearly. 
He was so tall and he was so smart, 
When he asked me to marry him it made I 
start, 
And his word went right clean through my heart— 
Singing, Oh! and. I 
love you dearly. 
Says he, " I 
must manage to find two pounds ten, 
Singing, Oh ! my dear, and I 
love you dearly. 
And as soon as I 
get it we'll be married then, 
For it's Oh ! dear, and I 
love you dearly. 
'Tis to pay clerk and parson, and the ring to buy." 
I've gut some money in the savings bank myself," said I. 
" 
Will you lend it me ?" " Of course I 
will," was my reply. 
For its oh I 
and I 
love you dearly. 
When five golden sovereigns to him I 
lent, 
Singing, oh I 
and I 
love you dearly 
And he showed I 
the ring, and I 
felt quite content, 
Singing, oh I 
dear, and I 
love you dearly. 
I'll be off to the parson at once, says he, 
So he did, and got married, but it warn't to me ; 
And my money not my lover no more did I 
see, 
And its oh I 
that he loved Inc dearly. 
MORAL. 
Now all you young women, take warning by me, 
When they say—My dear, oh I 
I 
love you dearly 
Never lend chaps your money us I 
did to he, 
Singing, oh I 
and I 
love you dearly. 
If they can't find the money to buy the rings, 
,Who's to pay for the victuals and such like things I 
For it's often for your money that a 
fellow sings, 
That it's—oh, but 1 
love you dearly.

THE SPIRIT OF THE STORM. 
Recitative. 
At sight of each terrific form, 
All trembling, and with fear oppressed, 
The halcyon quits her sea-built uest, 
Prophetic of a 
coming storm, 
To desolate a 
smiling land. 
Air. 
Loud roars the spirit of the storm; 
Their breasts the angry billows roar, 
Bursting their bounds they seem to arm, 
And battle with the murky air; 
The mariner then calmly feels, 
The perils of his hopeless state, 
Before high heaven he trembling kneels, 
And to its will resigns his fate, 
Though horrors rise upon his view, 
Resolved to steer the vessel true. 
Hoarse brays the trampet's throat—the while 
The fiends of war their firebrands shake; 
And carnage on some burning pile 
Sits brooding o'er an empire's wreck. 
'Tis thea the soldier's manly heart 
To home one tear-drop doth bequeath; 
Bends to that power that points the dart, 
Just midway twixt life and death, 
Though horrors rise upon the view, 
Resolved to fight the battle true. 
MANY HAPPY RETURNS OF THE DAY. 
Words by ELIZA COOK. 
Music by JOIIN BLOCKLEY. 
Merry words, merry words, ye come bursting around, 
Telling all that affection can say ;. 
'Tis the music of heart-chords that dwells in the sound 
" 
Many happy returns of the day." 
The red cheek of the child is more rich in its glow, 
And the bright eye more swift in its ray, 
When the mates hail his birth, in their holiday mirth, 
• 
And drink happy returns of the day. 
When his mate hail his birth, in their holiday mirth, 
And drink Happy returto of the day. 
But if ' midst the greetings there's one that we miss, 
And that one was the dearest of all, 
'Tis then we feel lone in a 
moment like this, 
When our loudly haird birthday shall fall. 
What would we not give if the hour could restore 
The dear form that is far, far away, 
If the voice of the loved one could wish us once more, 
"Many happy returns of the day." 
If the voice of the loved one could wish us once more, 
" 
Many happy returns of the day." 
The Old Man may smile while he listens and feels 
He hath little time longer to stay, 
Still he loveth to hear from the lips that are dear, 
" 
Many happy returns of the day." 
Then a 
garland, a 
bumper, a 
dance and a 
feast. 
Let the natal tide come when it mav, 
Be it autumn or spring, a 
gay chorus we'll sing, 
" 
Many happy returns of the day." 
Be it autumn or spring, a 
gay chorus we'll sing, 
n Many happy returns of the day."

AN ANGEL FORM IN DREAMS AEBELD. 
From BALFE'S Opera of SATANELLA. 
An angel form, in dreams beheld, 
Still charms my fancy's wakeful 
And morning's light has not dispell'd 
The radiance of its lovely guise, 
Still hovering near on buoyant wings, 
It bends on merits beauteous gaze; 
And in mine ear its sweet voice rings 
This wildest of all lovelorn lays, 
" 
Beloved by thee, myself to know, 
I'd welcome give eternal woe." 
Her beaming eyes were like in hue 
The azure deeps of ambient air, 
Her smile might bope and love renew, 
Within the blank breast of despair, 
And hovering o'er on buoyant wings 
She bent on me a 
wistful gaze 
Still in my ear her sweet voice rings 
The wildest of all lovelorn hys, 
" 
Beloved by thee, myself to know, 
I'd welcome give eternal woe."

A HUNDRED YEARS AGO. 
A hundred years ago, the world was just as now, 
The ways of men are same as then, and will be so, I 
trow, 
We've joy to raise our hearts, and grief: to lay them low; 
Yet joy and grief was just as brief, a 
hundred years ago. 
A hundred years ago, a 
hundred years ago, 
Yet joy and grief was just as brief, a 
hundred years ago. 
The gay and giddy crowd, which every day we view, 
Both young and old have passions strong, as those our grandsires 
knew ; 
In friendship and in truth, you'll find 'twas ever so; 
For fools believed, and knaves deceived, a 
hundred years ago. 
A hundred years ago, a 
hundred years ago, 
For fools believed, and knaves deceived a 
hundred years ago. 
Let heroes talk of war, in ages passed away, 
The laurels worn were proudly borne, as they that win to- day. 
What the' our valiant arms lay prostrate ev'ry foe, 
The men of old were quite as bold, a 
hundred years ago. 
A hundred years ago, a 
hundred years ago, 
The men of old was quite as bold, a 
hundred years ago. 
The since 'twas ever so, let pleasure be the theme, 
The song entwine with wit and wing, and woman reign supreme. 
Why gather life's dark flow'rs, when bright ones round us grow. 
It was the same whate'er you name, a 
hundred years ago. 
A 
hundred years ago, a 
hundred years ago, 
it was the satm., whate'er you name, a 
hundred years ago. 
THE CURFEW. 
Hark ! I 
hear the curfew's solemn sound 
Silent darkness spreads around ; 
Heavy it beats on the lover's heart, 
Who leaves with a 
sigh his tale half told, 
The poring monk and his book must part ; 
Awl f
,arful the miser locks up his gold, 
tjow, whilst labour siren aad_elatrmed sorrow, 
Forgets its heartfelt griefs until to- morrow, 
The winds whistle cold, 
And the stars glimmer red; 
The flocks are in folds, 
And the cattle in shed. 
When the hoarfrost was chill, 
Upon moorland and bill, 
And was fringing the forest bough, 
Our fathers would trout, 
The bonny brown bowl, 
And so will we do now, 
Jolly hearts! 
And so will we do now. 
Gaffer winter may seize 
Upon milk in the pail ; 
'Twill be long ere he freeze 
The bold brandy and ale. 
For our fathers so bold, 
They laughed at the cold, 
When Boreas was bending his bow, 
For they quaffed mighty ale, 
And they told a 
blythe tale, 
And so will we do now, 
Jolly hearts 
And so will we do now. 
SOUNDS SO JOYFUL. 
Sounds so joyful, bliss revealing, 
Pleasures o'er their senses stealing, 
Give my heart but bitter feeling 
Though a 
smile I'm doomed to wear, 
Every tribute they are bringing, 
All that beauty they are singing, 
Like an asp my bosom stinging. 
Yet delighted I 
mtr4 appear, 
From BALFIL'S Opera of " Satan()1Ia." 
Our hearts are not our own to give, 
They yield without a 
sign, 
Nor in our keeping seem to live, 
When once love says, " they're mine." 
In vain would reason's rebel voice 
The tyrant overthrow ; 
Did fate accord the power of choice, 
'Twould with our fond hearts go. 
Till, it securely Won, 
Love begg'd so piteously a 
part, 
I'd sought, and found I'd none; 
But o'er the theft I 
now rejoice, 
Such bliss from thence cloth flow, 
Did heaven accord the power of choice 
'Twould with my fond heart go. 
ECHO SONG. 
What fairy sound, 
Floats sweetly round ? 
Some spirit seems to play 1 
How did that note on ether float, 
And steal my soul away ? 
Still, still I 
hear the changeful strain— 
It mocks 1 
it echoes me again 1 
Is't fairy ground ? 
Are spirits round? 
Still, still I 
hear the changeful strain— 
It mocks, it echoes me again! 
- ' BE NOT FIRST TO OAST THE STONE: 
Often do we gaze below us, 
On a 
frail and falling form, 
Proud, as if sin did not know us, 
And our life- bloom hid no worm. 
Often do we breathe with scorning, 
Hard words in the sinner's ear, 
But methinks the holy warning 
Brings a 
gentler, gentler echo near. 
Pause, bold mortal, ere thou darest 
To ascend the judgment throne, 
He whose deeds were purest, fairest, 
Was not first to cast the stone. 
There is much of human trial 
In some human pathways set; 
Some lips drain the bitter phial, 
Which we have not tasted yet. 
Crime and folly mar the glory 
That lit up the Eden groie, 
But man's long and erring story 
Still seeks mercy, hope, and love. 
Pause, then, ye who sternly trample 
Those whom sin has overthrown; 
Heed your Master's great example, 
Be not first to cast the stone. 
THE FAIR LAND OF POLAND. 
When the fair land of Poland was plough'd by the hoof 
Of the ruthless invader— when might, 
-With steel to the bosom and flame to the roof, 
Completed her triumph o'er right; 
In that moment of danger when freedom invok'd 
All the fetterless sons of her pride, 
In a 
phalanx as dauntless as freedom e'er yok'd, 
I 
fon-ht and I 
fell by her side, 
My birth is noble, unstain'd my crest— 
As is thine own, let this attest. 
OLD MAD TON 
I'm old mad Tom. behold me I 
My wits are quite unfram'd; 
I'm mad, I'm sure and past all cure, 
And in hopes of being proclaimed. 
I'll mount the frosty mountains, 
And there I'll skin the weather, 
I'll pluck the rainbow from the sky, 
And I'll splice both ends together. 
I'll mount the stairs of marble, 
And there 
fright the gipsies; 
And I'll play at bowls with sun and moon, 
And win them with eclipses. 
I 
prentice was to Vulcan, 
And served my master faithful, 
In making tools h 
r 
jovial fools. 
But, ye gods, ye proved unfaithful. 
The stars plucked from their orbs too, 
And I'll put them in my budget; 
And if FM 
not a 
roaring boy, 
Then let the nation judge it. 
When I 
dream that you love me, you'll surely forgive, 
Extend not your anger to sleep, 
For in vision alone your affection can live, 
I 
rise and it leaves me to weep. 
Then Morpheus envelope my faculties fast, 
Shed o'er me your languor benign --
Should the dream of to- night but. resemble the last, 
Oh, what rapture, sweet love, is mine. 
Tho' in vision, sweet lady, perhaps you may smile, 
Olt, think not my rnance deficient : 
When dreams of thy presence my slumbers beguile, 
To awake will be torment sufficient. 
THE POWER OF LOVE. 
From BALFV8 Opera of SkLANELLA4 
There's a 
power whose sway 
Angel souls adore, 
And the lost obey, 
'Weeping evermore. 
I 
othtfnl mortals prize 
Smiles from it above, 
Bliss that never dies, 
Such thy power—oh, love 
Source of joy and woe, 
Foiler of stern hate, 
Lord of high and low, 
Woman calls thee fate. 
Fierceness owns thy spell, 
Vulture thou, and dove, 
Language cannot tell 
Half thy power—oh, love!

The cock may craw, the day may daw, 
And aye we'll taste the barley bree. 
Here we are met, three merry boys, 
Three merry boys, I ( row are we ; 
And mony a

And mony tnair we hope to be.

It is the moon I

'Twas lichaelmas eve, and rather late, 
Young Fanny went out to the Wishing-gate 
For often she'd heard the gossips tell— 
That was the spot where the fairies dwell, 
The fairies who granted to maidens dear, 
Whatever they ask at that time of year. 
So Fanny she went—her luck to try ; 
At the Wishing-gate ' neath the star-lit sky. 
But yet you shall hear, when the tale I 
state, 
That Fanny repented the Wishing-gate, 
"I wish for, I 
wish for," and here she sighed, 
I 
wish I'd a 
carriage, and grooms beside, 
I 
wish I 
had jewels—a 
wardrobe fine, 
Oh I 
what a 
dash at the boll I'd shine ! 
I'd marry the richest in all the land, 
Ad nobles and princes should ask my hand; 
And as to young harry, but never mind, 
He must think himself happy to ride behind. 
Oh I 
little she knew, tho' the truth I 
state, 
Young Harry stood close to the Wishing-gate. 
When Fanny went home, as the story's told, 
She had heaps of fine dresses and fairy gold, 
Her footman awaited their lady's call, 
And she went in her carriage to grace the ball I 
Young Harry was there, but he knew her not, 
Each youth that approached her soon fled the spot; 
For though all her raiment was rich and gay, 
Her face was bewrinkled, her hair turn'd gray;, 
So maidens beware of poor Fanny's fate, 
Don't ask for too much at the Wishing-gate

mode of Cooking and Preserving described in these pages are the results of 
actual personal experience; and hate never failed to produce the lact tasting

Let any
