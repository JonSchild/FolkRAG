RAPS AT FOLKS AND THE TIMES.

To shine with the upper- crust crew.

At their vile capers I think they've been

But they've got to knock under, and say 
they are wrong enough.

an' deir 
friends' pockets, likewise, precisely. 
TVhen 
will we hab peace ?
When de great American 
Eagle in triumph flaps his wings ober one 
Flag, one country, an' zwei glass oh lager 
beer. 
When will we hab peace? 
When we 
settle wid ole John Bull for his cowardly acts, • 
in aid ob Rebeldom. 
When will we hab peace? 
Yes, when, when? 
You know, my friends, 
arter a 
storm dere comes a 
calm ; an when it 
comes, I'll—I'll, yes, I
. will—run my face for 
drinks.

The Music of this Song to be had of Wm. R. Smith, 
Music Publisher, 135 North Eighth st., Philad'a. 
De old plantation's out oh fix, 
Who'll put it ' gain to rights ? 
Massa,'s gone an' lined de rebs, 
An' like old Satan fights. 
Old Missus locked de house, and left, 
And wid her took de key; 
De darkies, dey hab run away, 
All tinkin' dey am free. 
De old plantation's out ob fix, 
Who'll put it 'gain to rights ? 
De old plantation's out ob fix, 
For seh'ral days and nights. 
De fence rails, dey am scattered round, 
De grass, too's, lost its green; 
No chick- a-biddy-s ' bout de door, 
Or quackin' ducks are seen; 
De pen am dar, but nary hog, 
To gib a 
grunt or squeal; 
Uncivil war has been about, 
Dere's marks yet ob his heel. 
De old plantation's, &c. 
Great bits of lead and iron, too, 
Lie thick as hailstones round, 
You'd think some one had played at shoot, 
An' tore up all de ground. 
De mansion house, too's, suffered some, 
Whar massa passed his nights; 
It looks as though some wicked boys 
Had throwed and smashed de lights.
