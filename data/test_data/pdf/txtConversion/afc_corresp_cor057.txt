Mr. Harold Spivacke, Director Music Division Library of Congress Washington, D. C.
Dear Mr. Spivacke:
I am inclosing for your attention a letter from Professor Alton C. Morris, in which he
requests that duplicates of the 8 records of Greek folksongs made by him be sent to him at
the University of Florida.
The records referred to were sent to the Library of Congress on October 24, together with
a list of titles. Receipt of the records was acknowledged by Mr. Triggs on December 4th.
Included in this material (perhaps on an additional record) were several Czech songs.
Professor Morris allowed us to send these records to the Library of Congress because we
assured him that you had offered to send duplicates to our office, where he would have
access to them.
He has urgent need of the material, and we hope that you will be able to send duplicates
or the originals directly to him at the University of Florida.
