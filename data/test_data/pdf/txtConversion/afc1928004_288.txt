TONY 
P A STOR. 
A BIOGRIPIIICAL sketch of Tony Pastor would almost seem 
an absurdity. 
Tony Pastor is " one of the people with the-
people." 
Born in New York, he claims America, America 
whole and entire, from Maine to Mexico, as his birthplac, 
almost born in the profession, he has been for nearly twenty 
years before the public in the character of Amusement • Maker. 
For years, " Tony Pastor, Tim Clown" was a 
household word, 
now Tony Pastor, TUE Comic Vocalist," has taken its!lace. 
Tony Pastor's 6011 vs are sung in every household. I 
y 
every 
fireside from St Lawrence to the Gulf. 
He counts his ptrons 
by millions. 
At his Opera House in New York the popularity of hia 
songs are frequently attested by the audience joining in the 
chorus when he sings. 
A chorus of eight hundred voices is 
not infrequent. 
Tony Pastor has sung within the past ten years more orig-
inal songs than all the other singers in the world corn Dined. 
His songs are sung in the parlors of the rich and in the cab-
ins of the poor. 
For the past ten years he has been proprietor of Tony Pas-
tor's Opera House, 201 Bowery, New York, and during that 
time has presenied to the public every perf,rmer of note in 
the amusement world. 
Having the entire profession to choose from, he has been en-
abled to combine in his traveling company a greater amount 
of talent than has hitherto been embodied hi one organization; 
hence his present company, selected for his fourth annual 
tour. 
Tory Pastor is in person the very personification of good 
humor; his jolly round laughing face is a 
picture of mirth, his 
voice is remarkably clear and rich 
He acts his songs with an 
unction that is irresistible hence he is always en rapport with 
his audience. 
Tony Pastor can truly claim to be "America's representa-
tive vocalist." 
Tire only authorized edition of Tony Pastor's song book, 
containing a 
full collection of all of his songs, can be had 
via the troupe, or will be sent by mail postpaid on recept of 
2.5 cents, by the publisher, A. J. F

UNDER THE SEAS 
As sung by TON'Y PASTOR. 
'THE other night I 
went to bed, 
In ftct, I 
often do, 
..And in my sleep, went down to the deep, 
Where a 
strange tvprid met my view ; 
This world was called Concordia, 
Its people gay and free, 
wished ti a I 
were une of them, 
Fifty mile:. under the sea, 
cHunus. 
This is what I 
saw when dreaming, 
As plain, as plain could ! ,e, 
Tiny were oh s ) e 
m:ent. they never paid rent, 
Fifty miles under I 
liesea. 
Their food and drink was pare, and not 
Adulterated stun; 
They'd no G..od Tempi:ifs, for they knew 
\Vhen thty'd just 
enon t: h. 
They'd no ' blu,s 
p 
Lai ii to running in, 
No Div,,rec Court ita 
diev-7,0t. 
And they never ie.t I Pite Englishman," 
0 ! they were a 
h.tppy 
cuoacs. 
This is what I 
saw when dreaming, 
As plain, as plain could e. 
They'd ne'er had an " alger," no claimant" Sir Roger,'• 
Fifty miles under the sea. 
6 
They'd never had a 
national debt, 
They never were troubled with wars, 
They never had a 
man for the rates 
Come knock, knock, knock at their doors; 
The toothache, income tax, and corns 
They knew not—happy souls! 
Of railway smashes they'd ne'er heard, 
Nor the price of a 
ton of coals. 
CHORUS. 
This is what I 
saw when dreaming, 
As plain, as plain could be, 
You may doubt my tale, they'd no workhouse nor jail, 
Fifty miles under the sea. 
Itit ver a 
one had been known to dread 
The approach of quarter day, 
The ! mullet's- in-law all lived by themselves

away ; 
No pater was troubled with milliners' bills, 
Their children ne.er numbered a 
score, 
on may think it strange, it was wisely arranged 
That each should have two and no more. 
C 
H 
This is what I 
saw wiut a 
dreaming, 
As plain, as plain could be, 
I 
then heard a 
knock, and it's past ten o'clock, 
I 
came up then from under the sea.

NAUGHTY SUSAN JANE. 
As sung by TONY PLsToR, 
On, once I 
loved a 
little girl, 
Her name was Susan Jane, 
She set my brain all in a 
whirl, 
My bosom in a 
flame, 
For Tony Pastor, she has sold me, 
A 
fellow- you have heard, 
An u::ly brute who looks like me, 
Now wasn't that absurd. 
CHORUS-
Oh Susan Jane, oh Susan Jane. 
Once you said you loved me, 
Now I 
am full of grief anl pain ; 
You'll burst my heart, I 
know you will; 
Naughty Susan Jane. 
One night I 
asked my Susan Jane 
With me for to go, 
And hear the great star comique, 
Tony Pastor you all know, 
He came on the stage dressed up just so, 
In his hand he had a 
cane ; 
He touched his hat just like that, (Bus) 
Then winked at Susan Jane. 
Oh Susan Jane, etc. 
••• 
he waited for him‘here that night, 
While he came off the stage, 
And then he kissed my Susan Jane, 
Which made me boil with rage, 
He made a 
start then for to go, 
Miss Susan did the same, 
He turned and said, good night young man 
Then walked off with Susan Jane. 
The reason that I 
am here to-nialit 
Is to tell you of my grief, 
That's caused by that star comic, 
The great big sinzer chief ; 
He sings right here upon this stage, 
And he has gained great fame; 
But please don't let him sing again 
Till he gives up Susan Jane,

And her sweetheart who was my pal.

CENTRAL PARK, 
As sung by TONY PASTOR. 
Air " Beautiful Girts.” 
YOU may talk about pleasures gained 
By strolling on the sand, 
Or walking down Broadway where belles 
And swells oft do the grand. 
Or rolling home in a 
morning, boys, 
After a 
jolly lark ; 
But none of these can be compared 
With a 
stroll through Central Park. 
CIIORUS. 
Central Park when out for a 
lark, 
The place for enjoyment is Central Park, 
For beautiful belies, and flashy young swells 
You'll find them in Central Park. 
In Central Park one summer's night 
I 
met the girl I 
love, 
A 
graceful belle with sylph like- form, 
A 
perfect little dove, 
We strolled together arm in arm 
'Till it grew rather dark; 
'Tis blissful paradise on earth 
To walk through Central Park, 
Central Park, when out for a 
lark, etc. 
1 
I. 
We stopped a 
while to listen, 
To the music soft and sweet, 
Then saw her home, asked when and where 
Again I 
might her meet, 
She blushed and smiled, and looked so sweet, 
Then to me did remark ; 
" 
We'll meet again to-morrow night, 
The place, why Central Park." 
Central Park, when out for a 
lark, etc... 
While strolling in the Park one night, 
She gave me her consent; 
To see her ma and pa, of course 
We both together went, 
The moment that I 
asked for her,. 
The old folks did remark : 
" 
Yes, take her, and the honeymoon 
Go spend in Central Park. 
Central Park, when out for a

As sung by Tom, PASTOR. 
I 
COURTED once a 
lovely girl. 
A beauty young and fair, 
She'd cherry red lips, and teeth like pearl, 
And golden was her hair, 
Her eyes were like the evening stars, 
That shine in heaven above, 
And with this lovely beauty 
I 
was overhead in love. 
POKEN. — I 
shall never forget the first time I 
met that girl— 
ever— no never, and when the time came to bid her good 
bye, you know that time always comes, although it comes 
rather late with some, and rather early with others. 
We were 
early hirds that ti:ne—early in the morning you know. 
So, 
I'd gone through all the preliminary ceremonies, such as good 
bye, darling, and pleasant dreams, and I'd just slided my arm 
around her waist and was going to give her one good kiss 
right square on the mouth, when she boxed my ears and Ellid : 
011tS, 
" 
Don't you dare to do it, Gdorge, 
Don't you dare to do it, George, 
"If ' twas foulal out, what would my mother say? " 
Don't you dare to do it, George, 
Don't you dare to do it, George 
Ain't you a 
very, very, naughty man? " 
I 
took her for a 
walk one night, 
'Twos in a 
flowery dell, 
And while there, to my fair one, 
I 
tales of love did tell. 
She sat down in a 
shaded spot, 
I 
sat down by her side, 
And with my arm around her waist 
I 
said, ' darling, be my bride." 
SPOKEN. —" 
Yes," I 
says to her, says I— " Susan," sa19 
ys I 
— says I— " Susan," says I—. 
Darned if I know what I 
did say now ; but I know I said it, yes I 
did, and when I 
showed her the Hug, and asked her for her answer, she said: 
"get away George, you're always saying something," that 
means yes, yes it does, so I 
says to her, says I, I'll go and have 
our names put in the morning papers, and then 
go to the 
minister and have our names called in church next Sunday, 
George so-and-so, and Miss Susan so-and-so, to be joined to-
gether in holy wedlock, any one having any Objections will 
please state them or forever after hold their peace, and my 
Susan actually swooned over in my arms, yes she did ; and 
when she came to herself the very first words she uttered were: 
Don't you dare to do it, George, etc. 
Well I 
need not tell you more about 
Those happy nights we met, 
For soon we put otrcourting, boys, 
And married we did get, 
And now I 
feel so happy, 
Oh my heart is filled with joy ; 
For yesterday my Susan dear 
Brought forth a 
little boy. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, its the prettiest little baby you ever saw. 
Oh 
girls do come and see it ! all the girls in the neighborhood have 
been to see it, and they s,ly its the handsomest child they ever 
saw— the very picture of its father. 
I'm its father; yes I 
am. 
By the by, boys, before I 
go I'll let you into a 
little secret, on 
the quiet you know. When you take your sweetheart out for an 
evening's promenade and you want to kiss her good bye at the 
door, and she says, " don't you dare to do it," that's the time you 
must. 
They only pretend to be a 
little shy, why bless your 
souls after they're married their shyness and bashrtMiess all 
vanish just as quickly as a gLiss of lager in the hands of a 
thirsty Dutchman. Why, since I've been married, I 
don't reinetn-
her, not even once, my Susan ever saying : 
Don't you dare to do it, George, etc. 
As sung by TONT PASTOR. 
Air.—inarnensenuur. 
STRANGE sayings now are all the go, 
Wherever you may be, 
I 
don't know how it is with you, 
But t1s the case with me, 
Whatever kind of hat I 
wear, 
Let it be long or flat, 
Same urchin in the street is sure 
To sing out, " shoot the hat." 
CHORUS. 
,Shoot the beaver; shoot the hat, 
It makes a 
fellow look like a 
flat, 
Go where you will, you're sure that 
Some one will sing out, " shoot the hat," 
To a 
fancy ball I 
went one night 
With my sweetheart Sarah Jane, 
Determined for to cut a 
dash 
In my best hat and cane. 
When on the road an Irishman, 
I 
think his name was Pat ; 
Said, " Joe, dear friend, if I 
was you, 
I'de take and shoot that hat." 
Shoot the beaver, ,S:c. 
I 
went one night just for a 
walk 
Down 
street I 
strayed, 
Of that by word to rid myself, 
For a 
new hat there I 
paid, 
At 
famous hat store ' twas, 
The latest style that's out, 
I'd scarcely got outside the door, 
When boys began to shout: 
Shoot the beaver, ett. 
So now my friends, my song is done,

GO GET PERMISSION OF MA. 
As sung by TONY PASTOR, 
Air—" I 
fancy I've seen you before," 
I 
ONCE had a 
sweetheart, a 
charming young girl, 
A 
beautiful young village queen, 
A 
rustic young beauty with hair all in curl, 
And only just turned seventeen, 
When I 
told her I 
loved her, her head she hung down, 
And her cheeks colored up like the rose, 
So I 
thought I 
would try and just steal a 
sly kiss 
From the spot where her victuals all goes. 
SPOREN.—And I 
did try, but she stopped me and said; 
CHORUS. 
You must go get permission of ma, 
You must go get permission of ma, 
Before you attempt to do any such thing, 
You must go get permission of ma. 
While talking one night of what pleasure love brings, 
'Twas one pleasant evening in May, 
No dickey bird sailing through air on his wings 
E'er felt half so happy or gay, 
I 
asked my fair charmer if she would be mine, 
And begged she would then name the day 
When we should be married and settled for life, 
Just listen to what she did say : 
CTIORUS. 
You must go get permission of ma, 
You must go get permission of ma, 
Before we attempt to do any such thing, 
You must go get permission of ma. 
23 
Tier ma aid consent, and in one month from this 
Maria and I 
will be one ; 
To my suit the old lady with pleasure said yes, 
Her consent it was easily won; 
"But you must agree, said her mother to me, 
To what I 
am now about to say; 
When married you calmly submit and agree 
To let us have all our own way." 
SPOKEN.—This quite stunned me for the moment ; but re-
covering myself, I 
cooly replied : 
cnonus. 
You must go get permission of ma, - 
You must go get permission of ma, 
Before I 
agree to do any such thing, 
You must go get j)ermission of ma. 
A 
little advice to you girls I'll now give, 
So listen to what r 
shall say : 
When sweethearts want to marry, and with you to live, 
Don't say, " I 
must have my own way," 
If you do, as sure as I 
am singing to-night, 
Old maids I 
am certain you'll die, 
For a 
man's but a 
fool, if he does'nt tell you, 
Or rather unto you reply : 
cnonus. 
You must go get permission of ma, 
You must go get permission of ma, 
Before I 
agree to do any such thing, 
You must go get permission of ma.

DID you ever make love ? If not, have a 
try, 
I 
courted a 
girl once, so bashful and shy, 
A 
fair little creature who by the by, 
At coaxing and wheedling had such a 
nice way; 
Ev'ry ni-ht to her house I 
went, 
In harmless deight our evenings were spent, 
She had a 
queer saving. whatever it oitennt, 
For whenever I 
entered her house she would say : 
CHORUS. 
Pull down the blind, 1
,ull down the blind, 
Ptill down the blind, love, c.nne don't be unkind, 
Though we're alone, bear thi:, in mind, 
Somebody's looking, love, pull down the blind. 
How lovintr we were, bow cosy we'd chat, 
'Bout one thing and t'other, and this thing and that, 
With my arm round her \vaIst, how cosy we sat, 
Like two little turtle-doves perched on a 
tree; 
Such squeezing and teasing and pleasing we had— 
Such wooing and cooing to mak.. our hearts glad, 
With laughing and chaffing I 
near drove her mad; 
But still she was awfully spooney on Inc. 
SPOKEN. — AM1 if that soldier would only have left us alone, 
she would never have exclaimed: 
Pull down the blind, etc. 
One night, for a 
change, we went to the play, 
And when we got home she was awfully gay, 
She saw them make love, and so learned the way, 
The piece was 
Claude Melnotte," and suited her fine; 
She called me her rose- bud, her duck, and her dear, 
She threw her arms round me, whi:e fast fell each tear; 
She cried. oh, don't leave me, for sadly I 
fear 
You don't love me truly, say, will you be mine? 
SPOREN,—Just at that moment a 
policeman passed, and she 
said: 
Pull down the blind, etc. 
Our courting days o'er, at last we were wed, 
I 
oft bless the hoar when to church her I 
led, 
I 
now call her Mary, she calls we Ned, 
Were happy and loving-, 
and ncver know strife; 
-We've a

For her, I'd go din,' tire 
And water boiling hot. 
If my love would only love me, but 
Mv love she loves me not. 
I've taken her to parties, 
I've taken her to balls, 
I've taken her on the Underground Rail, 
And up to the top of St. Paul's, 
The Chamber of Horrors, at Madame Tussaud'S 
And such cheering sights a

I've showed her Dillingsg,ate Market, yes, 
But still she loves me not.

For my love I be a 
teetotaler, 
Or become a Hottingtot, 
If my love woulthonly love me, but 
My love she loves me not.

I've learned to act like Kemble, 
My lady love to please, 
I 
swear in solemn tragic tones, 
And flop down on my knees, 
I 
sing " Die Wacht am Rhein," to her, 
And of other songs a

I've learnt to play the cheerful flute; 
But still she loves me not. 
CHORUS. 
For my love I'd be vaccinated 
All over in every spot, 
If my love would only love me, but. 
My love she loves me not. 
Why is she so cantankerous ? 
Why is she so unkind ? 
Why 
is she so obstropelouse? 
Why smash my peace of mind? 
If she'd love me a

I'd do I 
don't know what, 
For her, I'd live on Australian beef; 
But, alas, she loves me not,

Ah, but yet I

shill nurrJ her some day, 
Although the date's beyond my calculttion,

THE GAY MASQUERADE. 
Sung by ELLA W ESNEA. 
SOME like gailyn parties, some like flower shows, 
For doing some spooning, just " under the rose," 
Some are partial to concerts, or lectures so staid, 
But my weakness, I 
fear, is the gay masquerade. 
CHORUS. 
I'm awfully fond of the gay masquerade, 
The gay masquerade, the bright masquerade, 
With sweet pretty darlings in costume arrayed, 
The gay masquerade for me. 
Some dances are like Quahers' meetings in style, 
So " starchy," and formal, one scarce sees a 
smile; 
But to do as one nes without feeling afraid, 
By jove the right place is the gay masquerade. 
I'm awfully fond of the gay masquerade, 
The gay masquerade, the dear masquerade, 
With sweet " tootsie wootsles'' so sweetly arrayed, 
The gay masquerade for me. 
To say most daring things, ' tis the easiest_task, 
To FOMO elegant creature whilst wearing a 
mask ; 
Oh the tales I 
have told, and the vows I 
have made— 
There's no place for flirting like the gay masquerade, 
47 
CHORUS. 
rm awfully fond of the gay masquerade, 
The gay mamperade, the bright masquerale. 
With dear " ppsy wopsics," so gaily arrayed, 
The gay masquerade for me. 
Each lady that's masked, for " a 
lrartiv," don't tall 
If you do then, " that's where you wii mal,e a 
mls,. ake," 
Some darling old spir eters you'll oft fad r.rrayckl. 
Who are fishiug fur flat; at the gay masquerade, 
SPOREN.—T. 
gPnerally go trt " Eornec,," and nntn.ally look 
out for my Julie 
my last " Ju'ict," was more fit for the 
part of " Norse—flfty if

I'm in love with such a 'laming little man. 
A 
musician in the military band, 
And I 
love him better thin gold or wealth, 
When I 
see Int in his uniform so grand. 
The first time that I 
met him, 
with love I 
was struck dumb, 
And my heart was in a 
flutter, 
When Charlie played the drum.

And it's 
One, two, three, with his sticks on the drum, 
Rap-a-tooele-tunAum, my sugar plum, 
Oh ! my ! but I 
tell you it's fun, 
When Charley plays the drum. 
Oh! he often comes to take me for a 
walk, 
And we stray along together, side by side, 
And so sweetly and so lovingly he'll talk; 
And once he ask'd me if I'd be his bride. 
And ev'ry Thursday evening, 
As soon as work iq done, 
I

My Charley play the drum.

THE evening star is brightly shining I 
ke a 
diamond in the sky, 
II-ste my love, my heart's , 
r. pining breathe thy tender 
shlh; 
Twitt.ring birds are fast asleep perched upon each verdant 
tree, 
Gentle zephyrs sighing creep o'er the deep tranquil sea. 
CHORUS. 
The evening star is bright shining like a 
diamond in the sky, 
Haste my love my heart's repining, gently breathe thy tender 
sigh. 
The tinkling bell is Leard afar, the frolicking lambs returning 
home, 
Then haste my I 
we from your mama, for this is the hour that 
you should come, • 
The dowsy beeI as ceased to hum, the daisie's closed its starry 
eye, 
The sun has sunk, the night has come, and here alone for thee 
I 
cry. 
The evening star is brightly shining, etc. 
What's that lightsome foot so near me, is it the leveret bound-
ing on? 
Will she come tomigi.t and cheer me? my lonely wanderer's 
song. 
Is that a ;41iost Oat comes to roar me? that's tills sound that 
makes me start? 
It's only the wind that's whistling near me, will the beating 
of my heart. 
The evening star is bri4htly shinin-, etc. 
Written and composed by OSWALD ALLAN. 
SHE said she'd only come to see how her poor daughter felt, 
She said I 
knew a 
mother's heart with fear was tit to melt, 
I 
did not then know mother's hearts, wife's mother's hearts I 
mean, 
I 
only know that since she came. I 
have most wretched been. 
SPOKEN.—She said she could not stop a 
moment, would not 
even take her things oil; but she's never been out of the house 
for twelve months till this morning, but now she's gone, so— 
CHORUS. 
Oh my ! hip hurrah ! 
My wife's mother's gone away, 
Stopped for a 
year— elite hT a 
day. 
Now she's gone, so hip hooray ! 
• 
The first thing that we fought about, was smashing all my 
pipes, 
And locking up the gin and rum, with nought to drink but 
swipes; 
Our grand encounter though remained, a 
dreadful thing to see, 
It was the evening when she made my wife dock my latch key. 
SPOKEN.—Ah ! 
I 
could stand anything, but the latch-key 
being docked, I 
even slept in the back kitchen, because moth-
er-in-law's cough was so had I 
put up with hot- tempers all the 
week, and cold dinners on Sundays, but now--now she's gone, 
Oh ! hip hurrah ! etc,.

YOU NEVER M1-35 THE WATER 'lin THE 
WELL RUNS DRY. 
WHEN a 
child I 
lived at Lincoln with my parents at the farm, 
The lessons that my mother taught to me were quite a 
charm; 
She would often take me on her knee when tired of childish 
And a
ila 
s
j s
31:e pressed me to her breast I've heard my mothet 
say— 
Waste not, Iva:lit not, is a 
maxim I 
would teach; 
Let your watchword be " dispatch," and practice what you 
preacht ; 
Do not let your chances, like sunbeams, pass you by, 
For you never miss the water till the well runs dry. 
As years roll'd on I 
grew to be a 
mischief-making boy, 
Destruction seent'd my only sport, it was my only joy; 
And well do I 
remember, when ofttimes well chastised, 
How father sat beside me then and thus has me advised. 
Waste not, &c. 
When I 
arrived at manhood, I 
embark 'd in public life, 
And found it was a 
rugged road bestrewn_with @ are and strife; 
I 
speculated foodshly. my losses were severe, 
But still a 
tiny, little voice kept whisp'ring in mine ear. 
Waste not, &c. 
Then I 
studied strict economy, and found, to my surprise, 
Ily funds, instead of sluicing, very quickly then did rise, 
I 
grasp'd each chance and always struck the iron while ' twat; 
hot, 
I 
seiz'd my ovportunities and never once forgot— 
Waste not, Jva. 
Im' married now and happy , I've a 
careful little wife, 
We live in peace and harmony, devoid of care and strife; 
Fortune smiles upon us, we have little children three, 
The lessons that I 
teach them, as they prattle round my knee 
Is, waste not. &c.

And the lads in the village they know right well, 
What a 
charmer exists in that rustic dell.

PADDIES FROM CORK. 
Entered according to Ant of Congress in the year 1,975, by A. J. 
rafri n, in the office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington. 
Written and sung by the GREAT FIELDING& 
A 
few years ago. from Ireland we sailed, 
Upon a 
big slip ',ha carries the mail; 
Nine days from the time that we left the Green Isle, 
We were both landed on American Soil. 
'Twas at Castle Garden we first struck tree clay. 
To see the City we walked up Broadway. 
As we kept walking, the people would stare, 
Remarking, ‘. Who is that beautiful pair 1" 
Crimaus. 
They're Paddies from Cork! 
Paddies from Cork! 
Only just landed in sweet New York. 
Each one we meet 
Says • There's two Green Horns, 
They're Paddies from Cork !" 
Since we have landed we've traveled a 
bit, 
And have not seen half this country yet 
I've learnt a 
lot, the short time I'm lre; 
Yes, he has learnt to drink Lager Beer; 
Yes, and play Billiards and Bagatelle ; 
And smoke his Cigar just like a 
swell ! 
Some dav of this City I 
may be Mayor. Misd,

with indignation at the wrongs which she suffered from

Teading one of the most absorbing works ever written, 
proving " truth stranger than fiction." 
The poet's lines are but a 
just description of the unfor-

Her form was faultless, and her mind, 
Untainted yet by art, 
Was noble, just, humane and kind, 
And virtue warmed her heart.

THE APPRENTICE, 
OR 
First Book for Mechanics, Machinists & Engineers 
By OLIVER BYRNE. 
12mo., cloth. $ 1.50. 
ENDORSEMENTS OF THE PRESS. 
The highest praise which can be given to this excellent 
elementary work on practical mechanics, consists in the fol-
lowing simple statement of facts 
The elitor of this journal, 
while teaching natural philosophy and chemistry in the 
Cooi)er Institute from 1859 to 1864, was in need of a 
text-
boo.;. of practical mechanics, adapted to the advanced classes 
who had been trained in mathematics; in his search among 
the many mechanical text- books, there was not one which so 
fully answered his requirements as the above work. 
It was 
therefore adopted and used with perfect satisfaction, and it 
is with pleasure that he receives it now as an old friend from 
the publishers, gives it his most earnest recommendation, 
and wishes it in the hands of all who are still in the fog about 
• 
tb 
units of work, calculation of the power of machinery,_ 
rejstance to motion, strain on material, etc. — ..Uanufacture • 
and Builder, July, 1874. 
The author of this work is well known as an extensivd , 
writer who has made some valuable additions to American 
tec'uuical literature, enumerated above in detail. 
The work 
we are now noticing is a 
theoretical treatise on practical me-
chanics, designed to supply a 
recognized - deficiency. 
Most 
of the works on mechanics treat the subject in 3, manner 
which is not available to young men commencing as appren-
tices in shops. 
Any yo4ng man with a 
fair knowledge of 
arithmetic may, however, use this work to great advantage ; 
it is not only suitable for a 
text-book, but also as a wolk 
of reference. 
Most ambitious young men will make them-
selves so familiar with its contents as to be able to refer 
readily to any portion of the book. 
The author has adopted 
a 
new notation to distinguish units of work from other units, 
which is not without value, and might be advantageously 
introduced into more ambitious works. 
The book is well 
printed on good white paper, and bound in still cloth covers.
