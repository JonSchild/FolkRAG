Dr. Hatcher, we left off one very important achievement that you have made, and you are in the
Academy of Nursing.
BH
Correct.
CH
Can you tell us about that?
BH
Okay. Well, the Academy of Nursing is an honor for those nurses who have attained a certain level, an
exemplary level of nursing throughout their career or throughout, you know, a specified period of time.
You are reviewed by a panel at the Academy to decide whether what achievements you have made in
nursing is worthy of the highest honor for nurses. So, there are increasingly more and more Black
nurses, but I am one of only three Chi nurses that are fellows in the Academy. One person died, one of
our past Supremes from Indianapolis, I'm looking at her, and another person from Indianapolis. No,
there's four of us, because we had two Supreme Basileus who were members, Rose and myself, make up
the four, and we have a fifth person who's an honorary member, Theta. So, those are the only nurses I
know of in the country that are Chi nurses and also on the Academy.
CH
Tell us a little bit more about the Academy of Nursing.
BH
Well, the Academy of Nursing started as-- It's, like, as an effort to recognize nurses for their
achievement in a variety of areas. Most people you will find in the Academy of Nursing are educators.
So, many of us who are more service people or policy people are kind of outliers, because that was an
effort that really was started by educators and a lot of researchers and things like that. So, the Academy
has people from across-- actually across the world who apply for it, and you should have sustained level
of excellence in nursing and measured impact. You can measure the impact of what you have done for
nursing in your field, in your area.
CH
When you are inducted into that you become a fellow.
BH
A fellow.
CH
What are the initials for that? Is that the FA?
BH
FAAN, they call it. Sometimes you'll have people call it Fanny. They used to call it Fanny.

CH
How many nurses are inducted? Is this annual?
BH
It's annual. It's increasing. They used to be really competitive but, I mean, at the most, there's about three
or 400 nurses.
CH
You apply for that or are you recommended?
BH
You have to be recommended. You have to have two people that nominate you for the Academy.
CH
They don't have to be persons who are in the Academy. They can be--
BH
Oh yes, they do.
CH
They have to be in the Academy to be--
BH
They have to be in the Academy, yes.
CH
So, this is peer-driven.
BH
Yeah, it is.
CH
What a great honor. Of course, we're so very proud of you and thank you so much for sharing that with
us.
BH
So, you know, and I think [inaudible 5:38] is probably in the Academy too, yeah. I think he came-- I'll
have to check on him.
CH
Okay. Alright. Thank you so much.
