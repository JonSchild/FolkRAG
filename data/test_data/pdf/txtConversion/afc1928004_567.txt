DOWN 
THE SIDE STREET TO THE GREEN LIGHT. 
I 
am hungry, I 
am cold, I 
am deserted ; 
0 
God! could I 
lie down and die! 
Is there no way my life could be righted? 
'Ti g 
bard to have no place to lie. 
From walking the streets I 
am weary, 
For me there is no shelter in sight; 
But down the Side Street to the Green Light. 
I 
go there for shelter to night. 
CHORUS: 
I am old, I 
am aged, and helpless, 
My young days of pleasure have gone by, 
When down the Side Street to the Green Light 
I 
wander alone there to die. 
My shoes they are toeless*and heelless; 
My pants and my coat are threadbare; 
My pleading for success is fruitless; 
I 
am a 
victim bowed down in despair. 
0 God, why was I 
born to be homeless? 
0 God change my darkness to light, 
For down the Side Street to the Green Light, 
I 
go there for lodgings to-night. 
Cnottus.—I am old, I 
am aged, etc. 
What! No, it can't be 'cause I'm aged 
They all shake their heads and pass by. 
Can it be those who are human 
Will see this old form starve and die? 
When I'm cold to be laid ' neath the green sod, 
And my soul takes a 
heavenward flight, 
My sufferings then they'll be over, 
No more then I'll seek the Green Light. 
CHonus.—I am old, I 
am aged, etc.

ARE YOU GOING TO THE MAT THI AFF?

There is a 
great sensation 
About a 
name yon hear now-a-days, 
The boys and girls all use it, 
It's about going to mat-in-flees; 
You can hear them say to each other, 
When they are going past, 
It's either Charles or Emma, 
"Are you going to the Mat this Aff?" 
Are you 
Not this 
Are you

By chance I 
met a 
lady friend 
I 
knew for many a 
day, 
I 
went with her out shopping, 
And I 
left her on Broadway, 
And the time that we were parting 
She winked at me and laughed, 
And then said, " Good-morning, Harry, 
Are you going to the Matt this Air?" 
CHouus.—Are you going to the Mat this Aff? etc. 
When boys are kissing pretty girls 
They don't know what to say, 
They commence to give them earaches 
Of new things out to-day.

THE GIRL IN THE BOSTON DRESS. 
1 
have been to Boston oft, and of its 
Passage made a 
fuss; 
.But now it, seems all things have changed, 
And Boston comes to us. 
1We meet everywhere we go, 
Where'er we walk or ride, 
And very often see some very pretty things inside. 
While promenading Regent Street, 
about three months ago 
I 
saw a 
strange person which made me cry out, Oh, 
:tars and garters! look at that! 
Oh, isn't it divine! 
it moves, it breathes, it lives, by Jove! 
I 
wish that it was mine. 
CHORUS. 
That girl, that girl, that dear girl, 
That girl with the golden hair— 
Frizzeled and fried, platted beside, 
Hanging right down to there. 
That girl, that girl, I 
found that I 
must caress 
The Boston in black buttoned right up her back, 
The girl with the Boston dress. 
r • 
5 
Now the Boston dropped its parasol, 
I 
rushed across the way; 
Some small boys thought it splendid fun, 
And shouted out hurrah! 
I 
picked it up, I 
wiped it dry, then handed it to her. 
She winked a 
wink and smiled a 
smile, 
And said, Oh, thank you, sir! 
I 
thought I'd never see a form so shapely, mixed with 
grace, 
The ancient statues of that girl-would never get a 
place. 
We chatted as we walked through terrace grove; 
And as I 
gazed upon that dress 
My blood grew bitter cold. 
CROiluS.—That girl, that girl, etc. 
I 
took the Boston ferry, where to every place I 
went, 
No end of time and money on the Boston dress I 
spent. 
I 
soon proposed, and it accepted me without delay, 
We went to church and got it done and then we came 
away. 
The guests had all, had all departed, 
And we two were left alone; 
1 
think it was the most momentous time I'd ever known. 
She east aside her Boston— 
Which was buttoned, tied, and pinned, 
And undone something like a 
tap, and 
Let out all the wind. 
CHORUS.—That girl, that girl, etc. 
TIIE WHALE GOT JONAH DOWN. 
The whale and Jonah wrestled one day, 
Jonah did his best to try and get away, 
The whale was quick and Jonah was slow, 
So the whale told Jonah he had to go, 
Jonah he tussled and kicked all around, 
So the whale got his holt and put Jonah down. 
CHORUS. 
The whale got Jonah down, 
The whale got Jonah down, he did, 
The whale got Jonah down, 
Kept him forty days and forty nights, 
Oh, the whale got Jonah down, 
The whale got Jonah down, he did, 
The whale got Jonah down, 
Kept him forty days and forty nights. 
While old Jonah was inside, 
Ev rybody thought that he would die, 
But old Jonah liv'd so very long that, 
Gradually he began to grow strong, 
lie asked the whale if 
he would let him up. 
And the whale says, No, but I 
ii keep you down. 
Chorus.—The whale got Jonah down, & e. 
Then brother Jonah thought he was right, 
And he tried to steal out on one Sabbath night, 
lie thought the whale was sleeping quite sound, 
Jonah s:aid to himself, Oh now I'm gone, 
So the whale heard him and said he was wrong. 
So he closed his mouth and he kept him down. 
Chorus.—The whale got Jonah down, &c. 
Just the night before the fortieth day, 
Jonah on the inside began for to pray, 
Ile wept' so hard and he sung so long, 
lie dra,w'd all the fishes from miles around, 
So the whale took sick and went to dry land, 
And heaved brother Jonah on a 
bar of sand. 
Chorus.— The whale got ,Jonalt down, & c. 
OUT IN THE CHILLY NIGHT. 
Out in the chilly night when snow is falling 
And mother nature looks pale a a 
sheet, 
A 
voice from the night winds plaintively calling, 
Sad and forsaken alone in the street; 
Perhaps • tis the cry of some poor friendless orphan, 
Or perhaps ' tis some wanderer lost in the snow, 
Or perhaps tis the wail of some poor helpless outcast. 
Sad and forsaken with nowhere to go. 
CHORUS. 
Out in the chilly night when snow is falling 
And mother nature looks pale as a 
sheet, 
A 
voice from the night winds comes plaintively calling. 
Sad and forsaken, alone in the street. 
Oh break, ye sa d 
hearts, from the confines that hold th- ,• 
Prisoner to fate and to cold ruthless man, 
'Twere best to die,than this wide world should scorn t 
how shall you escape the sharp sting of its pain? 
The snow that is falling shall make thee a 
pillow, 
The earth that is frozen shall be thy hard bed. 
And the stranger who gazes upon thee to-morrow 
Shall find the poor outcast frozen and (lead. 
Chorus — Out in the chilly night, & c.

To surprise me in Wry form ;

From dark until sunrise in the morn,

Be home early to- night, my dear boy.

KEEP YOUR TEMPER, JOHNNY. 
.1 thought. I 
would get married, about five years ago, 
So I 
did, and had good luck, which all my neighbors 
know ; 
I'm the leader of a 
family, and have little children three. 
And every night when I 
came home, little Bob would 
climb my knee, 
And then he would get sleepy, and loudly he would cry. 
My wife seeing me geCangry, these words to me she'd 
say. 
Keep your temper, Johnny, and do not be so wild, 
Keep your temper„ Johnny, for once you were a

You know it runs in families, so he is not to blame.

see,

IT DON'T BELONG TO ME. ' 
When I 
was but a 
little boy, I 
used to go to school,

was so very good, some said I 
was a 
fool; 
But yet I

thing that didn't beloiw: to me. 
I

The other day as I 
walked out, by a 
policeman I 
was 
stopped. 
He said, " Young man, this purse of gold now from your

But as I 
never carried one, and had but little coin, 
As an honest boy I 
did reply, The purse it is not mine.

lived in humble style; 
But with the girls I

I

But little they knew I

placed it in my hat, 
I 
saw a 
lady come down the street, I

GRANDMA'S OLD ARM-CIIAIR. 
Composed and sung by Frank S. Carr. 
My Granny, do you see, at the age of eighty-three, 
One day was taken ill and soon she died ; 
And after she was dead. the will to us was read, 
By a 
lawyer, as we stood side by side. 
To my brother then I 
found, she had left a 
hundred 
pounds. 
And the same unto my sister. I 
declare; 
But when he came to me, " Ah," the lawyer says, " I 
see, 
She's but left to you her Old Arm-Chair." 
CHORUS. 
How they they tittered! how they chaffed! 
How my brothers and my sisters laughed, 
When they heard the lawyer declare. 
Granny only left to me her Old Arm-Chair. 
Now I 
thought it hardly fair, yet I 
said I 
did not care. 
And in the evening took the chair away ; 
The neighbors at me laughed, and my brother at me 
chaffed, 
And he said. " 'Twill come handy. John. some day, 
When you're settled down in life, take some young girl 
for your wife.  
And then you'll be happy, I 
declare. 
And when at home at night, and your fire is burning 
bright, 
You can sit down in your Old Arm-Chair." 
Cilonus.—How they tittered! how they chaffed! etc. 
What my brother said came true, for in about a 
year or 
two 
I 
soon was settled down in married life; 
I 
first a 
girl did court, and then the ring I 
bought, 
Took her to church, and soon she was my wife. 
Now the old girl and me, we're as happy as can be, 
And when my work is over. I 
declare, 
Abroad I 
never roam, and at night I 
stay at home, 
And sit down in my Old Arm-Chair. 
CHORIIS;—HOW they tittered! how they chaffed! etc. 
Now one night the chair I 
found had fallen to the 
ground, 
And the bottom had dropped out upon the floor; 
And there, to my surprise, and right before my eyes. 
Laid some bank-notes of ten thousand pounds or more. 
When my brother heard of this, now the fellow. I 
confess, • 
And mad with rage he almost tore his hair, 
When I 
said, " Now, brother Jim, don't you think it is a 
sin 
Thatdidn't get the Old Arm-Chair?"

FIFTY CENTS. 
Words by Billy Mortimer. Music by D EM Lewis: 
I took my girl to a 
fancy ball, 
It was a 
social hop. 
We staid until the folks went out, 
And the music it did stop. 
Then to a 
restaurant we went, 
The best one on the street. 
She said she wasn't hungry; 
But this is what she eat: 
A dozen raw, a 
plate of slaw, 
A 
chicken and a 
roast, 
Some sparrow grass with apple sass, 
And soft-shell crabs on toast, 
A big box stew with crackers, too; 
Her appetite was immense. 
When she called for pie I 
thought I'd die, 
For I 
had but Fifty Cents. 
She said she wasn't hungry, 
And didn't care to eat. 
Now I 
have money in my clothes, 
That says she can't be beat. 
She took in so cosy, 
She's got an awful tank. 
She said she wasn't thirsty, 
But this is what she drank: 
A 
glass of gin, a 
whiskey skin, 
It made me shake with fear, 
Some ginger-pop with rum on top, 
A schooner, then, of beer, 
A 
glass of ale, a 
gin cocktail, 
She ought to have had more sense. 
When she called for more I 
fell on the floor, 
For I 
had but Fifty Cents. 
19 
You bet I 
wasn't hungry, 
And didn't care to eat, 
Expecting every moment 
To get kicked into the street. 
She said she'd bring her family around 
Some day and have some fun. 
I 
gave the fellow the Fifty Cents, 
And this is what he done: 
He smashed my nose and tore my clothes, 
And hit me in the jaw. 
He gave me the prize of a 
pair of black eyes, 
And with me swept the floor; 
He grabbed me where my pants were loose 
And kicked me over the fence. 
Take my advice don't try it twice 
When you have got but Fifty Cents.

SIGNOR MACSTINGER, THE BARITONE SINGER. 
I 
sing of a 
feminine gender, 
One whom I 
thought so divine, 
Delicate, gentle and tender, 
Hoping some day she'd be mine. 
For Op-ras this girl was crazy, 
And Opera singers as well, 
For when I 
said. Be mine, she replied, "I 
decline, 
And the reason I 
quickly will tell." 
CHORUS. 
She said at Her Majesty's Theatre. 
There was the man of her choice, 
Signor Mac Stinger, a 
Baritone singer 
With such a 
magnificent voice. 
I 
tried with my voice to enchant her. 
Tra la la, la la la, la. 
But she said, It wont fizz, yours is nothing like his, 
'Ira la, la la la,, la la in. In. 
Said I. Darling be not so silly, 
Let me not live, dear, alone, 
Smile on your own loving Billy, 
And turn up your big baritone; 
I'll take lessons from Mrs. Weldon, 
If you say that you'll marry me, 
Just wait for a 
year, and I 
have no fear, 
I'll warble as well then as he. 
SPOKEN.—No, it was no use.— 
Chorus.—She said at Her Majesty's Theatre, & e. 
I 
tried to persuade my dear Nancy, 
For that was the sweet creature's name, 
Said I, If long hair is your fancy, 
With pleasure I'll wear mine the same; 
And though— as you see— I 
have done so, 
-Wear fur on my coat too as well, 
I 
find it no use, I 
get naught but abuse, 
And she sticks to her baritone swell. 
SPOKEN.—Although I've spent no end of money on Mrs. Allen's Hair 
Restorer, and to dress Operaudo Italian°. No, it's no go. 
Chorus.—She said at Her Majesty's Theatre, &c. 
I've paid notes and gold for her daily, 
Plainly I've stated my case. 
In joke I 
have said to her gaily, 
That my notes wee good. his were bass, 
But last night she pointedly told me. 
My hopes and my wishes were vain. 
So I'll leave off my fur, and cut off my hair. 
And never be happy again. 
SPOKEN.—And as fat' as she is concerned. 
MITti
CHORUS. 
She can purchmse Her Majesty's Theatre, 
She can marry the man of her choice. 
And be Mrs. Mac Stinger, a 
wife of a 
singer. 
With such a 
magnificent voice; 
And though my warbling could not enchant her, 
Tra la la, in in la, la, 
And she says it wont fizz, it's much better than his. 
Tra In, In la in, la in la, In. 
OF WHAT IS THE OLD MAN THINKING? 
Of what is the old man thinking, 
As lie leans on his oaken staff ? 
From the May-day pastime shrinking. 
He shares not the merry laugh; 
But the tears of the old man flow, 
As he looks on the young and gay. 
And his gray head moving slow. 
Keeps time to the air they play. 
The elder are drinking. 
But not one cup will he quaff. 
Oh! of what is the old man thinking, 
As lie leans on his oaken staff ? 
'Tis not with a 
vain repining, 
That the old man.sheds a 
tear, 
,Tis not for his strength declining, 
lie sighs not to linger here. 
There's a 
spell in the air they play, 
And the old man's eyes are dim, 
For it calls up a 
past May-day, 
And the dear friends lost to him : 
From the scene before him shrinking, 
From the dance and the merry laugh; 
Of their calm repose he is thinking, 
As he leans on his oaken staff. 
THE 31ElillY CHINK, CHINK, CHINK. 
Some sing of charming women, 
Some sing of praise of drink, 
I'll sing of what we all adore, 
And that's the merry chink. 
You may call it filthy lucre, 
You may call it filthy dross, 
But up a 
tree you're sure to be 
When you've to mourn its loss. 
CHORUS. 
For there's nothing half so jolly as the chink, chink, chink, 
Nothing half so handy as the chink, chink, chink, 
You may do without a 
wife, you may do without a 
drink, 
But you can't do without the merry chink, chink, chink. 
A roguish little darling lends 
Enchantment to your life, 
Your paradise would be complete 
If she'd become your wife! 
Towards bliss :Master Cupid 
Blindly leads you to the brink, 
Where he very often drops you 
If you haven't got 
the chink." 
Chorus.—For there's nothing half so jolly, etc.

And where would be our darlings, 
0 
whatever would they do? 
There'd be no balls or picnics, 
Nor snug dinners up at Kew. 
Swan and Edgar's, Peter Robinson's, 
And such " sweet" shops I 
think, 
Would be naught to them without that 
Most accommodating " chink." 
Chorus.—For there's nothing half so jolly, etc. 
Should you wish to test your better half, 
As to her love for - Tin," 
Just sign a 
check— leave it blank. 
And let her 1111 it in. 
Each week the Bank rate would go up, 
We'd all go smash. I 
think, 
If lovely women only had 
The run of all the chink! 
Chorus.—For there's nothing half so jolly, etc. 
FIZZ! FIZZ! 
Where am I? Mister Lamp-post, don't dance in the air! 
I—I 
recollect now, that I've been 
To a 
glorious party, a 
full dress affair! 
And I'm now going home all serene. 
The spread was delightful, the wines were all right ; 
But the fact of the matter now is, 
That we have imbibed to our hearts' full delight, 
And got slew'd on glorious fizz. 
CEIORUS. 
Fizz, fizz, glorious fizz, 
I 
own it with meekness, 
I've got a 
great weakness 
For fizz. fizz, nothing there is, 
To equal the flavor of glorious fizz. 
When supper was over. I 
danced with Miss Brown, 
And she was the belle of the ball; 
But we hadn't stood up long, before we fell down. 
To the gratification of all. 
But in picking her up, I 
unfortunately 
Asked, Where did you hurt yourself, Liz? 
Said she, That's no business of yours. but I 
see 
That you've had a 
deal too much fizz. 
(SPOKEN.) "Beg pardon," said I, " allow me to inform you that, next 
to lovely woman, it is impossible to partake of too much— 
CHORUS.—Fizz, fizz, etc. 
We filled up each glass for the fortieth time, 
And the jolly good health we did drink 
Of our host and sweet hostess, in language sublime. 
With musical honors, I 
think. 
Then at the suggestion of old Tommy Jones, 
Who is reckon'd a 
bit of a 
quiz, 
I 
sang them a 
song in most sweet husky tones, 
Brought on through that last glass of fizz. 
(spoxEN.) I 
got about half way through the second verse when I 
broke 
down, and said, " Gen'inen, beg pardon, ladies and gen'inen, I 
can't sing , 
but I'll give you a 
toast instead—Here's long life to us all, and may we 
always have plenty of— 
CHORUS.—Fizz, fizz, etc. 
I've just shaken hands with the pump, I 
believe, 
Which has caused me a 
bit of a 
spill; 
But for such slight accidents I'll never grieve, 
Though I 
wish the lamp-post would keep still. 
My head is beginning to spin round and round, 
• 
And I 
fancy that this isn't " bizz," 
So 
wish you good evening, for I'm homeward bound, 
To sleep and to dream still of fizz. 
CHORUS.—Fizz, gzz, etc. 
4.,  
I'VE BEEN PHOTOGRAPHED LIKE THIS. 
To haN7e my photo taken in some strange outlandish dress, 
Or some more outlandish attitude has longbeen, I 
confess, 
The aim and object of my life, and if you only knew 
The months of thought it's taken me to hiton something new ; 
For I've been photograpled like this, I've been photograph'd 
like that, 
I've been photlgraph'd in this style, with a large Gains-
bore' hat, 
They have photograph'd me smiling at a 
bird upon a 
stick, 
But I 
never have been taken— as a 
raving lunatic. 
In former times by brush and pen and sword, folks rose to 
fame, 
But nowadays there's but one way to win a 
well known 
name.— 
You must be photograph'd and put about for public show— 
Then fame is sure, for as you walk about each one will 
know— That 
You've been photograph'd like this, you've been photo-
graphed like that, 
You've been photograph'd 'mid falling snow, in a 
large and 
furry hat, 
They have photograph'd you standing with your hands 
behind your back. 
But you've never yet been taken as a 
raving maniac. 
Love used to level all ranks. but the greatest leveller — 
That I 
know of at the present is a 
good photographer. 
Go seek his shop and there. I 
vow, may every day be seen 
Some naughty, naughty lady twixt a 
Bshop and a 
Queen. 
For 
She's been photo'd behind a 
fan with her face half hid from 
sight; 
She's been photograph'd upon a 
swing, with clothing rather 
light! 
They have photograph'd her leaning with her arms across a 
stile, 
But she'd better far been taken as a 
feeble imbecile. 
You all have read the story of Lord Lovel and the maid, 
Who, when ask'd what was her fortune, " My face, kind 
she said. 
If in 'those days a face was worth so much, one may 
surmise 
The fortune that a modern beauty now might real!!. . 
When 
She's been photograph'd like this, looking innocent and good, 
She's been photograph'd with lilies, and giving chickens 
food! 
They have photograph'd her driving in a 
sporting coat and 
hat, 
And the next time she'll be taken as the bounding acrobat. 
DOWN BY THE OLD MILL STREAM. 
You must know that my uncle is a 
farmer. 
Keeps a 
large farm in the \Vest. 
While staying there I 
met a 
little charmer, 
And many's the time I 
caress'd 
That girl so fair, with nut-brown hair. 
Her equal ne'er was seen. 
And where I 
met this charming little pet 
Was down by the old mill stream. 
Ah! 
Cnotzus. 
Down by the old mill stream 
There many happy hours I've seen. 
Strolling day by day we pass'd the time away. 
Down by the old will stream. 
Her father was the owner of a 
dairy. 
Her brother worked the plough, 
And while I 
used to roam with little Mary. 
Her mother would milk the cow; 
But hem father said we should not wed. 
Which I 
thought rather mean. 
As she could not be my wife, she said she'd end 
her life, 
By drowning in the old mill stream. 
Chorus.—Down by the old mill stream. etc. 
Now the old man looked at his daughter, - 
Saying. " I 
don't believe a 
word that you say," 
But when he saw her struggling in the water, 
He exclaimed. --Do save her. pray !" 
But it was too late, she had met her fate. 
Oh. what a 
terrible scene! 
The old man cried, as the neighbors tried 
To pull her out of the stream. 
Chorus.—Down by the old mill stream. etc. 
At last they got her out of the water. 
And sonic of the neighbours said. 
"0 Brown, you've been the ruin of your daughter, 
For the girl is really dead !" 
He tore his hair, gave way to despair, 
Ban away. never more was seen. 
And now, I'm told. the dairy is sold. 
That stood by the old mill stream. 
Chorus.—Down by the old mill stream, etc. 
0 FRED, TELL THEM To STOP. 
No doubt you have beard of the great Fancy Fair, 
That used to take place every day ; 
Well. I 
thought for amusement I'd take my 
To pass a 
dull hour away. 
We went in. you must know, 
And saw Richardson's show. 
And Forepaugh's menagerie as well ; 
There were roundabout swings, 
And all kinds of things; 
Forget the day I 
never shall. 
girl there, 
(SPogEN.
.) 
Yes, when we got to the fair, my girl wanted ta have a 
rido 
on one of the roundabouts; I 
said, " All right, my darling," and we had a 
swing; but directly tlie swing went to and fro, she lustily called out,— 
CHoRus. 
"Oh! Fred, tell them to stop ! " 
That was the cry of Maria; 
But the more she said, " Wo ! " 
They said, " Let it go!" 
And the swing went a 
little bit higher. 
The people that stood round of course they all laughed, 
But I 
only said, " Stop the swing! " 
There were four or five others in the boats beside us, 
Saying, " Master, don't do such a 
thing." 
Then four or live roughs 
Caught hold of the ropes, 
Maria fell down on her knee; 
And one of them said, 
" 
The young man's turning red, 
But isn't he having a 
spree?" 
Cflortus.--Oh! Fred, tell them," etc. 
They soon stopp'd the swing and Maria got out, 
And quickly fell down on the floor; 
They brought her some water, which soon brought her to 
This girl whom I 
now do adore. 
Should you ever go there, 
To the great Fancy Fair, 
Friends, take advice whilst I 
sing 
Of the great roundabout, 
It's the best fun that's out, 
And finish the day with a 
swing. 
(SrokEN.) Mark now before you get into the swing boat, make a 
bar 
gain with your young lady not to call out— 
CHORUS.— " Oh! Fred, tell them," etc. 
I've had all the ills that belong to our youth, 
The whooping-cough, measles, and cold; 
I've cut all my teeth, and don't eat with a poon, 
So now I 
begin to feel old. 
My ma gazes fondly upon her dear boy. 
With traces of care on her brow, 
And the tears fill her eyes, while fondly she sighs, 
" 
He's getting a 
big boy now." 
CHORUS. 
I'm getting a 
big boy now, 
And I 
fancy it's time I 
knew how 
To brush my own clothes, 
And to wipe my own nose, 
For I'm getting a 
big boy now. 
I 
smoke my papa's best cigars ev'ry day, 
And once a 
week I 
get drunk, 
I 
wink at my nurse when she puts me to bed, 
And rocks me to sleep in my bunk. 
I 
once tried to kiss her, she sternly refused, 
And said, " That I 
cannot allow, 
And in future, you elf, you must sleep by yourself, 
For you're getting a 
big boy now! " 
CHORUS. 
I'm getting a 
big boy now, 
Fin getting a 
big boy now, 
Sometimes I 
get tight, 
And stay out all night, 
For I'm getting a 
big boy now. 
If I 
go to a 
party, I 
flirt with the girls, 
That is, if they're bigger than I 
am; 
I 
wink and I 
squeeze, and make love on my knees, 
And always ready to sigh am. 
I 
once took my cousin away from the throng, 
For a 
kiss ' neath the mistletoe bough, 
She did what I 
bid, and she liked it, she did. 
I'm getting a 
big boy now. 
CHORUS. 
I'm getting a 
big boy now, 
I'm getting a 
big boy now. 
And they say before long 
They're afraid I'll go wrong, 
I'm getting a 
big boy now. 
This Christmas 1 
went to my first pantomime, 
I'd never been taken before: 
And now that I've been, and the fairies I've seen, 
I 
want to see several more. 
When I 
saw the fairies trip on to the stage, 
I 
felt I 
can scarce explain how. 
But I 
know that I 
thought their skirts rather short, 
And l'm getting a 
big boy now. 
Cliolius. 
l'm getting a 
big boy now. 
And that's the best part. you'll allow, 
Where they dance in a 
row, 
And stand on one toe. 
Oh, l'm getting a 
big boy now. 
Sometimes I 
go out for a 
spree with my pals, 
And we jump on poor cripples and babies, 
Old women and such, but men we darn't touch, 
For we're only a 
parcel of gabies. 
And when we can muster a 
hundred or more, 
We're ready to kick up a 
row, 
I'm a 
coward, 1 
own, for I'm no good alone, 
And I'm only a 
big boy now. 
Citortus. 
I'm getting a 
big boy now, 
I 
can fight, kick, and bully, I 
vow, 
And of course 1 
don't mind, 
I 
only get fined, 
Because I'm a 
big boy now. 
TOOTHPICK AND CRUTCH. 
I'm one of those enchanting youths that any day you'll meet. 
Say simply lounging in the " Row" or doing "Regent 
Street ;" 
I'm not o'erstock'd with cash or brains, but that don't mat-
ter much. 
I 
always look distingue with my " tooth-pick and my 
crutch." 
CHORUS. 
Tooth-pick and crutch, tooth-pick and crutch, 
Lisping a 
lingo, that sounds double Dutch, 
Eye-glass in eye, toddling by. 
Yes, fin the hero of " toothpick and crutch." 
I 
never think of rising till the streets are nicely aired, 
For what some folks call " exercise" this infant never cared; 
And oft when bent on "S 
and B," I 
toddle to my Club. 
I 
see the horrid common men who haunt the nearest " pub." 
38 
(SPOKEN.) Yaas, the drinking habits of the beastly populace are simply 
disgusting. What the deuce do they want with beer in the middle of the day? 
They're not up all night at Balls and Parties, and they don't get jolly in 
"the small hours;" consequently they don't feel seedy, and want, like me, 
a 
pick-me-up before they feel equal to— 
CHORUS—Toothpick and crutch, etc. 
At night to the Criterion or Gaiety I 
go. 
Anti all the pretty barmaids at those gay resorts I 
know; 
The little darlings say that I'm a 
prize they'd like to clutch. 
I've " slain" them all completely 
with my toothpick 
and my crutch. 
(SpoKEN.) Why, only the other evening I 
heard one of them say to 
another, " Ada, love, who is that dear delightful fellow who comes here so 
often and spoons you for three-quarters of an hour over a 
glass of bitter?", 
"Oh! why, that's my Charlie! 
Isn't he a 
pet? Do you know what we all 
call him here? why— 
CHORUS.—Toothpick and crutch, etc. 
Those vulgar comic papers do their best to drive me mad. 
They call me empty headed, idle, spoony. and a 
cad: 
But what they know about such things I 
wonder very much. 
It's a 
glorious Institution, is the toothpick and the crutch. 
(SPoKEN.—Yaas, and what's more, it's an institution that an awful lot 
of fellows go in for—and fine fellows, too— like me—every one of them! 
It's quite a 
sight! ' pork honor, to see the "tooth-pick brigade" parading in 
some fashionable locality, and to hear us chanting our own particular 
"God save the Queen," which runs somewhat after this style— 
CHORUS.—Toothpick and crutch, etc.

CARRY YOUR FRIEND IN YOUR POCKET. 
I 
don't say that I'm right, there's a 
saying quite trite, 
If you've goodness of heart tho' twill shock it, 
It's that selfish expression of mind number one. 
And carry your friend in your pocket. 
It's that selfish expression of mind number one, 
And carry your friend in your pocket. 
Ms a 
palpable fact. and requiring great tact. 
Grim Poverty's inroad to block it. 
For friendship's all fudge. and of that you may judge. 
if you haven't a 
rap in your pocket. 
Whilst you're young and in health. by industry gain wealth, 
Your coffer. you'll very soon stock it; 
After that you can go, and be bowed and scraped to, 
As they know you've a 
friend in your pocket. 
When ' tis known you have cash. why, the veriest trash 
You utter goes off like a 
rocket; 
You're a —brick," tho' a 
stick. and are flattered till sick, 
Thro the friend you have got in your pocket. 
But be poor and in want. and just ask for a 
loan, 
The need yott set forth, they oft mock it, 
And say, " I'm so short." or, " Really I 
can't," 
Or. "I 
haven't as much in my pocket." 
They say ' tis no sin to be wanting in tin, 
The nerve of those needy. ' twill shock it, 
So where'er you roam. abroad or at home, 
Put your only true friend in your pocket.

THE BALLET GIRL. 
I 
sing of a 
beautiful ballet girl, 
So sylph- like. so young and so fair; 
I 
ler lips were like coral, her teeth were like pearls, 
And she'd beautiful golden hair. 
I 
ventured to go to the play one night, 
And got a 
front seat in the pit; 
But the while this fair one was doing her pas, 
By Jove! I 
scarce knew how to sit. 
CHORUS. 
While she danced on the light fantastic toe, 
Round on the stage she used to go ; 
Had it not been for a 
man named Joe, 
She might have belonged to me. 
She always wore a 
most beautiful smile. 
When she near to the footlights came; 
When site danced on one toe, it affected me so. 
That my "buzzum" felt all in a 
flame; 
There was scarcely a 
day but I 
bought a 
bouquet 
To send her. which oft cost a 
crown, 
She was styled in the bills, " Mademoiselle de Blu-Pils." 
Which in English meant "Mary Ann Brown." 
Cthouus.—While she danced on the light fantastic toe. etc. 
To see my delight. I 
went there every night. 
For nothing could keep me away ; 
When she'd bound on the stage. her eye to engage, 
I'd cry out Brayvo ! and Hooray! 
When a 
swell got a 
using his opera glass. 
And a 
quizzing her elegant form ; 
I 
felt that I 
must either punch him or bust, 
For I 
felt so exceedingly warm. 
Utionus.—While she danced on the light fantastic toe, etc. 
41 
I 
wrote and I 
told her I 
loved her sincere. 
And begged that she'd answer my note; 
To say that she'd meet me, if only for once, 
But no, not a 
word she e'er wrote; 
To the stage door I 
went my love to give vent, 
And sent word that I 
wanted Miss Brown; 
When Macbeth in a 
rage ruslCd clean off the stage, 
Pulled my nose first and then knocked me down. 
Cuonus.—While she danced on the light fantastic toe. etc. 
That's the first time that I 
and Macbeth had e'er met, 
And that once. sure I 
thought quite enough; 
His right name was Joe, my ballet girl's bean, 
Oh. that news made me feel like " Macduff;" 
I 
challenged him flat to mortal combat, 
But got only laughed at for my pains; 
Then I 
rusb'd from their sight and vow'd that that night 
The river should hold my remains. 
CitoRus.—While she danced on the light fantastic toe, etc. 
I 
went towards the river, and then I 
turned back, 
For I 
couldn't quite make up my mind 
To lay down and die, without one more try, 
Some true little darling to find. 
I 
at times in the bills see the name of Blu-Pils. 
For she dances the while she has breath, 
And sometime ago, she married her Joe. 
Who murders • Shakspeare' and ' Macbeth.' 
Ctioncs.—While she danced on the light fantastic toe, etc.

A LOCK OF moTRER's HAIR. 
Words by James C. Field. Music by Dan Lewis. 
I've a 
treasure I 
hold I 
love dearer than gold, 
Which I've kept from the days of my youth, 
It's the dear little emblem of love and of hope, 
And it always has brought me the truth. 
It's advice and a 
gift that my dear mother gave. 
On leaving this great world of care. 
And though small, it to me is far dearer than life 
It's a 
lock of my dear mother's hair. 
Cnolius. 
Through this world I 
may yet have to roam, 
Of misfortune I 
might have a 
share, 
But there's nothing I'll prize, or within my heart lies. 
Like that lock of my dear mother's hair. 
Just a 
day before mother had gone to that land. 
She gave me advice for the best. 
And with it, a 
lock of that bright golden hair. 
Saying, Mother ' 11 be soon with the blessed ; 
You must be a 
good boy, for you were mother's joy, 
And we'll meet in that land bright and fair, 
And to keep my in memory, also my advice. 
I 
have given you a 
lock of my hair. 
CHORUS.—Titrough this world, Lte 
In this world I 
may yet meet with sunshine and gloom, 
I 
may meet with fine jewels quite rare, 
But that gift from my mother I'll prize more than all, 
For I 
know I'm endowed with its care. 
I 
will keep her advice, ' tis the joy of my life, 
Tin we meet in that land bright and fair; 
And 'till then I'll not part with that treasure so dear, 
"fis the lock of my dear mother's hair. 
CHORUS.—Throtigh this world, Ltc

THAT'S JUST HOW MARRIED LIFE SHOULD BE. 
My husband is a 
dear good man, 
He tries to please me all he can; 
I 
love him well, and he loves me, 
That's just how married life should be! 
He goes to bus'ness every day, 
From home he seldom stays away, 
But comes and sits and talks with me, 
That's just how married life should be! 
CHORUS. 
My husband is a 
dear good man, 
He tries to please me all he can ; 
I 
love him well. and he loves me, 
That's just how married life should be. 
When we were wed, we thought how gay 
We'd pass our time from day to day, 
But storms arose upon life's sea, 
That's just how married life should be! 
But after storms the sun does shine, 
And so it was with me and mine; 
The storms were braved together—we ? 
That's just how married life should be! 
CHORUS.—My 
husband, &c. 
And when sometimes cross words arise, 
(At which you will not feel surprise,) 
He is the first to say to me, 
'Tis not as married life should be! 
And if I 
still should frown or pout, 
He'll make a 
fuss and take me out; 
In fact, he will not disagree, 
That's just how married life should be! 
CHORUS.—My 
husband, &e. 
Thus years have passed, I 
scarce know how, 
But, we can take things easy now, 
We've saved enough for him and me; 
That's just how married life should be! 
And now were getting old and grey, 
We hope when life shall pass away, 
To meet above, both him and me, 
Thus ended married life should be! 
CHonus.—.11y husband, &c. 
I WON HER LITTLE IIEART WHILE DANCING. 
Of all the girls that e'er you meet, 
There's none that's half so fair 
As her I've chosen for my bride, 
With her none can compare. 
I 
won her little heart when dancing, 
She says my steps are quite entrancing. 
CHORUS. 
Ah! of all the girls that e'er you meet 
There's none that's half so fair • 
As 
her I've chosen for my bride, 
With her none can compare. 
I'm only waiting for the time 
When silo belongs to me, 
The wedding bells shall gaily chime, 
Oh then how happy we shall be. 
I 
won her little heart while dancing, 
She says my steps are quite entrancing, 
CHORUS._h!
Of all the girls that e'er you meet, etc. 
Music by Dan Lewis. 
I'm a 
noble son of Erin, 
Sure I'm well known to fame, 
I 
live above in Harlem. 
O'Hallahan's my name. 
As on the street I 
pass them, 
The blackguards at me cry, 
Who cut the string? see there he goes, 
O'Hallahan the guy. 
CHORUS 
Come, shoot the guy boys, stag him, they say, 
I'm persecuted by night and by day, 
If they don't stop soon I'll make them cry, 
I'm nearly distracted with O'Hallahan the Guy. 
Last Sunday morning early, 
The gang I 
chanced to meet, 
They had their fill of benzine, 
And kicked me around the street, 
A copper rushed upofithem, 
But at him they all cried, 
The tarrier has been cheating us, 
O'Hallahan the guy. 
I'm going to run for governor, 
Elected sure I'll be, 
I'll paralyze the blackguards, 
Throughout the country, 
ril keep them from insulting 
The decent passers by, 
I'll be time people's favorite, 
OlIallahan the guy. 
THE MINSTREL BOY. 
The Minstrel Boy to the war has gone, 
In the ranks of death you'll find him; 
His father's sword he has girded on. 
And his wild harp slung behind him. 
"Land of song !" said the warrior bard, 
."Tho' all the world betrays thee. 
One sword, at least, thy rights shall guard, 
One faithful harp shall praise thee !" 
The Minstrel fell !—but the foeman's chain 
Could not bring that proud soul tinder: 
The harp he lov'd ne'er spoke again. 
For he tore its chords asunder; 
And said, " No chains shall sully thee, 
Thou soul of love and bravery! 
Thy songs were made for the pure and free, 
They shall never sound in slavery." 
In the hush of eventide, 
Sitting by my cottage door, 
Fancy softly seems to glide, 
Backward to the days of yore, 
And I've heard in changeful swells, 
Sweetest tones of melody, 
'Tis the sound of silver bells, 
Silver bells of memory. 
CHORUS. 
Silver bells, silver bells, 
Silver bells of memory, 
Silver bells, silver bells, 
Silver bells of memory. 
Many faces have grown old, 
Many forms been laid to rest, 
Underneath the churchyard mould, 
Ones I 
loved the most and best, 
Since I've heard the distant ewells, 
Floating on the winds to me, 
Low and sweet the silver bells, 
Silver bells of memory. 
Chorus.—Silver bells, silver bells, & c. 
Now, I 
seem to live once more, 
All the dear delightful past, 
E'er the shadows long before, 
Sunny skies had overcast, 
When we wandered in the dells, 
Linger'd in the flow'ry lea, 
List'ning to the silver bells, 
Now the bells of memory. 
Chorus.--Silver bells, silver bells, & c.
