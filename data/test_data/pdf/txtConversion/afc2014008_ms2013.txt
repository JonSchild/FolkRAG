At t

.5-to-4 million
 
people a year co me by t

Metropolitan Opera, i
t

AR: Would you e
laborate a l
i
ttle on your
 
a
ssociation with t
he IMS?
 
DD: I
've been on i
t s
ince i
t
s beginning,
 
s
even y
ears ago. I
 went on originally be-
c
ause t
he National Endow ment f
or t
he
 
Arts never gave money t
o museu ms f
or
 
operating purposes. They t
hought i
t was
 
t
oo b
ig t
o t
ake on. They s
upport t
he oper-
a
tions of t
he perfor ming a
rts: s
y mpho-
n
ies, t
heaters, and dance co mpanies. But
 
t
hey never would s
upport museu ms. They
 
would help t
he m with projects, which was
 
of s
o me help, but i
t d
idn't answer t
he
 
proble m of paying t
he cost of operating.
 
So, I
 l
obbied f
or t
he l
egislation t
hat c
re-
a
ted t
he IMS. When we got i
t
, I
 went on
 
f
or a
 one-year t
er m. They persuaded me
 
t
hat i
t was necessary t
o s
tay on f
or a
 s
ec-
ond t
erm of f
ive y
ears. That ended l
ast
 
year, but no one was appointed t
o r
eplace
 
me. So, I
 am s
till t
here until t
he end of
 
t
he y
ear.
 
I
 t
hink t
he IMS i
s v
ery important be-
c
ause i
t
's t
he only group t
hat g
ives oper-
a
ting s
upport t

museu m co m munity had no p
lace t

natural h
istory museu m, a z
oo, an aqua-
r
ium or a botanical garden got no help
 
f
rom anyone. They now get i
t f
ro m t
he
 
IMS. My hope i
s t
hat, a
lthough we're r
ela-
t
ively modest i
n s
ize now, we get up t

ignificant job f

AR: You have been i
nvolved with the
 
Metropolitan s
ince 1951?
 
DD: Yes, I t
hink t
hat was probably t
he
 
year I
 was e
lected. I
 never r
e me mber
 
whether i
t was 1950 or 1951, but i
t was a
 
y
ear or s
o before I
 went i
nto govern ment
 
s
ervice.
 
AR: So, you were i
nvolved with a
ll of
 
t
hese concerns before t
he govern ment be-
gan f
unding t
he a
rts?
 
DD: I became i
nterested i
n govern ment
 
f
unding during my f
our years a
s Ambas-
s
ador t
o France. I
 witnessed what t
he Eu-
r
opean govern ments d
id f
or t
he a
rts and
 
l
 s
aw t
he importance of exchanges. I
 pro-
moted s
o me of t
he f
irst exchanges be-
tween t
he United S
tates and France i
n t
he
 
early '
50s. We had "Oklaho ma!" co me
 
over, and I
 got t
he Metropolitan and t
he
 
Fogg Art Museum t
o put t
ogether a
 great
 
collection of drawings t
o co me over. I
 got
 
t
he Museu m of Modern Art t
o l
et us
 
bring over so me paintings. And the
 
French people poured i
n t
o s
ee t
he m. I
 
s
aw i
t
 was a
 very great help i
n r
eaching an
 
understanding between peoples. So, I
've
 
a
lways been very s
trongly i
n f
avor of
 
t
hese a
rt exchanges.
 
Then I c
a me back here and got r
e-
i
nterested i
n museu ms. I
nflation was just
 
p
icking up. We, i
n t
he a
rt world, were just
 
beginning t
o have f
inancial proble ms and
 
naturally t
his o
ther experience came t
o
 
my mind. I
t s
ee med t
o me t
hat t
he Fed-
e
ral govern ment had a
 role t
o p
lay.
 
In Europe, a
lthough they are co m-
p
letely govern ment-supported, museu ms
 
s
t
ill enjoy r
easonable autono my. They a
re
 
not  politically controlled. That's s
ome-
t
hing everyone s
hould r
ightly be afraid
 
o
f. But i
t s
ee med t
o me t
hat, i
f t
he U.S.
 
Govern ment could do i
t t
o. an extent —a
 
small, not t
otal extent —that t
hat would be
 
very helpful. Then, the Endow ments
 
ca me a
long and supported the per-
f
or ming arts.
 
AR: As a me mber of t
he National Coun-
c
il, and f
eeling t
his way about govern-
ment s
upport f
or t
he arts, what would
 
you l

AR: How do you f

everyone i

There i
s a potential t
here f

f t
hey a

 t
hink t
hey c
an do a
 
great deal of good.
 
The Getty i
s v
ery good f
or Los Angeles.
 
I don't mind t
he Getty buying two or
 
t
hree great collections of photography
 
and suddenly s
etting up a photography
 
collection. I
 d
o mind, personally, t
heir im-
pact on t
he prices of paintings and draw-
i
ngs and t
hings of t
hat nature. They s
ay
 
t
hat t
hey only pay what t
he t
hings a
re
 
worth. But I
 don't doubt t
hat t
he Getty,
 
being a
ctive i
n t
he market and willing t
o
 
pay whatever people a
sk, has l
ifted t
he
 
general l
evel of prices of t
op-level work t
o
 
considerably
 above — maybe
 twice
 
above —what t
hey would have been with-
out t
he Getty. As s
o meone who i
s i
nter-
ested i
n acquiring works f
or another
 
museu m, t
hat's not v
ery a
ttractive.
 
I
 t
hink t
hey a
re t

o do t
he r
ight
 
t

hat much t
o
 
spend, i
t
's v
ery hard t
o s
ay, "Well, we
 
won't pay any more t
han t
his, and we'll l
et
 
the Metropolitan have i
t i
f they pay
 
more." You c
an't a
sk t
he m t
o do t
hat.
 
But, t
he r
esult i
s a r
atcheting effect on
 
t
he b
ids f
or a
rt which s
ends t
he prices
 
way up. So, I
 have mixed emotions about
 
t
he m.
 
AR: When d
id you begin collecting and
 
why?
 
DD: I
 went on t
he I
nvestment Co m mittee
 
of t
he Metropolitan Board, not because o
f
 
any great i
nterest i
n a
rt, but I
 was an i
n-
vest ment banker. Each t
rustee was a
s-
s
igned a department, and mine was t
he
 
Depart ment of Prints. The curator of
 
prints a
t t
he Metropolitan was a f
ellow
 
called Hyatt Mayor. My two years with
 
h
im f
ired me up. He got me v
ery i

e

Then, I
 went t
o F
rance where a
lt has i
t
 
h
igher profile t
han here. My i
nterest
 
grew, particularly i
n decorative a
rts.
 
When I
 got back here, I
 began t
o b uy  a
 
f
ew paintings. I
 never bought many —
 
eno ugh f
or a roo mful, maybe 15 or
 
20 —and t
hen I
 got i
nterested i
n c
era mics.
 
So, 1
 collected s

which I
 have s

F
inally, when I

beca me i
nterested i
n Chinese painting, an
 
a

n which we were weak. Professor
 
Wen Fong o
f Princeton was our curator.
 
He probably knows more about Chinese
 
painting t
han anyone outside o
f China.
 
He got me v
ery excited.
 
One of t

AR: Do you paint?
 
DD: I
 never was able t
o do t
hat. I
n f
act, I
 
was a v
ery poor draftsman. When I
 went
 
t
o boarding s

duce a

I
 r

 drew a

 was

Mine was s

s

"That way!" So, I

Mrs. Hodges s

here i
s a v
ery r
eal
 
danger  of  t
he  Endow ment  "over-
challenging" an organization.
 
"We've f

"Our budget o

ay: '
Look,

an do. We c
an't do any-

nto t
he

Under Jeanne Hodges, t
here will be
 
changes i
n t
he Challenge Grant Progra m.
 
"We don't f
und operating expenses
 
any more. We a
re going t

Jeanne Hodges believes a s
tate Chal-
l
enge (
;rant Program could work. "
1 co me
 
f
rom North Carolina, a s
tate with an ex-
t
raordinary a
rts program. I
n t
he early
 
y
ears, I worked a
t t
he North Carolina
 
Museu m of Art, which was the f
irst
 
museu m i
n t
he country where a
 s
tate l
eg-
i
s
lature appropriated f
unds f
or a
cquisi-
t
ions. For years, we worked i
n an o
ld
 
h
ighway  ad ministration  building.  Two
 
years ago, we f
inally got a museu m.
 
Again, t
he s
tate appropriated f
unds f
or
 
t
he new building.
 
"
I t
hink a l
ot of t
he progra ms t
hat t
he
 
Federal govern ment does f
und need t
o be
 
s
eriously considered by t
he s
tates and by
 
private enterprise and corporations."
 
Jeanne Hodges s
ees t
he private s
ector
 
a
s an important i
ngredient i
n t
he s
uccess-
I
 u
l s
upport o
f t

"
I would l
ike t
o encourage applicants
 
t
hat have not been f

he Endow-

o keep co ming hack and t
o t

again. I
'd l

"
I would l

But Jeanne Hodges i
s a

"

"
I'd l

n
 
1

o a
llow organizations t
o co me back
 
f

 t
hink t

been on t

I
 would have waited another year or s
o
 
before a

been deferred.
 
"
In another t

o f

our s

with a s

ike i
t or not, I
'm s
tuck with t
he
 
1983 decision t
o go back i
nto a s
econd
 
r
ound of Challenge Grants. So, having a
c-
c
epted t
hat, I
 t
hink i
n t
hree t
o f

we w
ill be f
aced with a l
ot of very, v

hard questions about Challenge. Do we
 
s

ions t

(

grant t
o he f
unded? Do we r
estrict or

a t
horough knowledge of her program

I t

VOICES

Dear ARTS Review:
 
I
n h
is r
eflections on "Art v
s. Arts"
 
(
ARTS Review, Summer 1
984), Ed
 
Newman observes, i
nter a
/ia, "Nobody
 
g
reets an Arthur w
ith, 'Hi Ya, Arts .
.....
 
Ed's p
rescience i
n t
his r
eminded me of
 
my Ode t
o Arthur S
chlesinger. The l
atter,
 
a
 h
itherto justifiably unpublished work,
 
was p
roduced i
n 1
963 and, but f
or
 
Newman's t
imely r
eminder, might never
 
have s
een t
he l
ight of t
he l
i
terati.
 
But, t
ouching a
s i
t
 does w
ith equal i
r
-
r
elevance on t
he weighty t
ruths r
evealed
 
i
n t
he ARTS Review, i
t
 would b
e a
 d
istinct
 
d
isservice t
o your r
eaders t
o k
eep i
t
 under
 
wraps f
or another t
wo decades.
 
Accordingly:
 
Oh Arthur S
chlesinger
 
Ask we w
ith v
erve
 
S
ince when s
uch a
 messenger
 
D
id f
ate deserve?
 
For u
s i
t
's euphorian,
 
Heady and r
are,
 
To know a
 h
istorian
 
Who was a
ctually t
here.
 
Actually, f
actually t
here.
 
And while you were d
issected
 
And t
aken apart
 
You were a
lways r
espected
 
And never c
alled, "Art."
 
Never c
alled "Art."
 
Music and Poetry, y
es, but not "Art."
 
Thus d
ignified
 
With p
roper Arthurity
 
Your f
ame w
ill abide
 
With e
ternal s
ecurity.
 
And any who'd s
ay
 
Your power has d
iminished
 
Might well t
heir words weigh
 
At l
east t
i
l you're f
inished.
 
I
n a
 desperate e
ffort t
o wrench t
he
 
f
oregoing i
nto s
ome r
ecognizable f
ocus, I
 
would posit t
hat t
he h
istory of a
rt i
s
 no
 
more c
ompelling a
 s
tudy t
han t
he a
rt of
 
h
istory. To s
ay t
he c
reative i
nstinct balks
 
a
t t
he t
hreshold of h
istorical analysis i
s
 t
o
 
belittle both t
he i
ntent and t
he s
kill of h
is-
t
orians down t
hrough t
he ages.
 
History, a
s we come t
o s
ee i
t
, i
s not, a
s
 
a
sserted Will Rogers, "
just one darn t
hing
 
a
fter another." I
t i

b
rushstrokes applied b

hat s
uccession of
 
i
ndividuals who c
laim, or a
re c
laimed, t
o
 
be h
istorians. These people a
re a
rtists.
 
Decisions must b
e made i
n painting and
 
s
culpture a
s t
o what t
o i

r omit i
n
 
order b
est t
o p
roject o
r c
onvey t
he a
rtist's
 
i
ntent. Can l
ess b
e s
aid of Herodotus,
 
Thucydides, G
ibbon, Toynbee, or Arthur
 
S
chlesinger? The h
istorian p
resents i
n t
he
 
c
olors he chooses, and i
n one, two o
r
 
t
hree d
imensions, a
 v
ision, or many v
i-
s
ions, of t
he p
ast. So, i
t
 i
s
 well t
hat t
he
 
Museum of History and Technology was
 
r
enamed t
he Museum of American His-
t
ory. At l
east t

rees
 
t
he mind t
o c
onsider t
he a
rtistic, not t
he
 
purely t
echnical, r
ole of t
he h

Anyway, t
hat's how I
