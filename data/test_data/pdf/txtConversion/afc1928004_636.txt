THERE'S A 'LAGER ON THE TABLE. 
Air—There's a 
letter in the candle. 
Written and sung by BILLY SNOW. Banjo solo. 
0 : — 
There's a 
lager on the table, 
And it points direct to me; 
If I 
only had a 
nickel, 
How happy I 
would be. 
How quickly I'd invest it, 
And quench my burning thirst; 
But there is no use in talking, 
I 
must get my nickel first. 
CHORUS: 
Bright days of old, come to my memory, dear, 
When I 
had money plenty, I 
always bought my beer; 
B:ight days of old, come to my memory, dear, 
When I 
had money plenty, I 
always drank my beer. 
There's some tramps around here told me, 
There was good times coming yet; 
I've been waiting here to see them, 
'Till I'm almost out of breath. 
If I 
thought that they would be here, 
Or knew that they would come; 
I 
think one glass of lager 
Would heal my burning tongue. 
Chorus 
You, bright, amber-colored fluid, 
That goes floating down my side; 
And for you there's been many a 
man 
Laid right down and died. 
I 
know you're good and healthy, 
And if I 
only had my way, 
And money to support it, 
I 
could drink five kegs a 
day.

END SONG. 
Written and composed by BILLY SNOW, and sung by him with great 
success. 
Now listen, white folks, and I 
will sing to you, 
Down in the Southern land, many years ago: 
When I 
used to pick de cotton and de sugar cane, 
Down in de Southern land, many years ago. 
There is old Uncle Ephraim and Aunt Caroline, 
Down in the Southern land, many years ago; 
They used to make de hoe cake and cook it in de sun, 
Down in the Southern land, many years ago. 
(humus. 
So wake up, ye colored folks, and roll up your pants, 
Git on de floor, be ready for de dance; 
De old moon is shining, she was up in de sky, 
And we'll dance till de sun rises in de morning. 
[Repeat. 
We stick in de field till de sun does set, 
Down in de Southern land, many years ago; 
Den we go 
to our cabins and we get our supper eat, 
Down in de Southern land, many years ago. 
There is oh! Uncle Ephraim, and I 
tell you he ain't slow, 
Down in the cotton field, many years ago; 
When he picks up de essence on de old banjo, 
Down in de Southern land, many years ago. [ Chorus. 
When old Eph begins a 
picking, de wenches get a 
kicking, 
Down in de Southern land, many years ago; 
The perspiration from the skin it poisons all de chickens, 
Down in de Southern land, many years ago. 
And when we get tired, we lay down on de floor, 
Down in de Southern land, many years ago; 
And dream of de same old gig, 4-11-44, 
Down in de Southern land, many years ago. 
Something of a 
Wrestler. 
Written by H. 
BENNETT, and respectfully dedicated to AL. W. 
FiLsots 
and sung by him with unbounded success. 
0, I'm something of a 
wrestler, I 
often take it in, 
Whenever there's a 
boxing match I 
ante up my tin. 
I'm something of a 
sporting man, I 
like to make a 
bet, 
I 
stand a 
chance of losing, but I 
never done it yet. 
A 
little bit of pleasantry occurred the other night, 
I 
went to see a 
wrestle and it ended in a 
fight, 
A 
Scotchman, a 
Dutchman, a 
Turk and a 
Mick, 
And poor Johnny Riley got slugged with a 
brick. 
CHORUS. 
Then nobody knows what a 
racket there was there, 
Nobody knows now, I 
tell you, I 
declare. ( Repeat chorus.) 
Now the cause of all the trouble I 
could never keep it mum, 
Somebody called Johnny McIntire a 
bum; 
Johnny got up and he stuck out his hand, 
And he swore he could lick any cripple in the land. 
Big John Monohan was standing by the door, 
He caught a 
hold of McIntire, and threw him on the floor; 
He went for little Brady, and he hit him such a 
crack 
That he knocked his Sunday shirt clean off of his back, 
Then nobody knows, &c.

New York. 
Last night I 
was out rather late— 
'T was only an innocent spree 
:My wife for my coming did wait, 
When sleeping I 
thought she would be; 
I 
found her in temper and tears; 
" 
Oh," she cried, " it's a 
sin and a 
shame!" 
And she scratched both my eyes and my ears; 
But I 
told her I 
soon would explain. 
CHORIIS.--The " Club " had a 
meeting to-night, love, 
Of bus'ness we had a 
great sight love; 
Don't think for a 
moment I'm tight, love, 
I ' ve only been down to the " Club." 
My boots I 
left down in the hall, 
And softly I 
crept up the stairs; 
I 
kept rather close to the wall, 
And thought to ascend unawares; 
But just as I 
got to the door, 
I 
seemed to get lost in the dark; 
I 
stumbled and fell on the floor, 
And just then I 
could only remark— 
CuoRus.—The " Club" had, etc. 
She sobbed and she wept and she screamed, 
And said she'd go back to her Ma; • 
While I 
on the mantel-piece leaned, 
And tried to enjoy my cigar. 
I 
promised to buy her a 
dress 
If she 'd 
let me alone for awhile; 
Then I 
gave her a 
sweet little kiss, 
And I 
saw her beginning to smile. 
SPOKEN.—S0 
I 
thought it a 
favorable opportunity to 
assure her once more, as a 
positive fact, that—

The Gray Hairs of My Mother. 
tVords by GEO. COOPER. 
Music by T. BRIGHAM BLSHOP. 
The gray hairs of my mother, 
This tress, this tress recalls them now, 
Again I 
see them cluster, 
In beauty, in beauty round her brow: 
Oh, then, tender are the mein'ries 
That wake from out the past, 
I 
live again life's morning, 
Too beautiful, too beautiful to last. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, the gray hairs of my mother! 
This tress, this tress recalls them now, 
Again I 
see them cluster, 
In beauty, in beauty round her brow. 
The gray hairs of my mother, 
This tress recalls them now, 
Again I 
see them cluster, 
In beauty, in beauty 'round her brow, 'round her 
brow. 
Once more I 
kneel at twilight, 
In childhood's simple, earnest pray'r, 
Once more I 
see the homestead, 
And all, and all the blessings there! 
Oh, lovely tress of silver, 
Whatever cares may be, 
My heart, in all its trials, 
Is nearer Heaven, is nearer Heaven for thee. 
Cnontis.---Oh, the gray hairs, etc.

Eva, Eva, Tell me where my Eva's gone, 
She has left here to sigh and to mourn, 
Can't you tell me where my Eva's gone I 
And in this that seem'd a 
happy dream, 
I 
was so proud and brave; 
And when I 
woke and found ' twas hut a 
dream 
I 
found myself a 
slave! 
Eva, Eva, &c. 
I 
long to dream that happy dream again, 
To see my home so fair; 
For now I 
roam where all is sad and drear 
And life is full of care.

THE SWEET RIGHT AWAY.

There's a 
sweet by and bye that they sing about of late, 
And the good time a

That's all very ti,ce but I 
think you will agree 
If they'd make it right away how much better i 
would p.) 
Oh, the sweet right away, Oh„ lie sweet right away. 
That's the song now to sing and the motto for the day, 
For life is but fleeting we haven't long to stay. 
Let our joys then by shining in the sweet right away. 
In the sweet by and bye. Oh, they piomIse everything, 
And the days they are passing, but aothing do they bring 
Oh, the " proof oi the pudding" h 
in eatmg it they say, 
It that good time is coming let 1, conic rigb.1 away, 
Oh, the sweet right away,

That's the stylc all hc whik and the motto for the day, 
For life is but fleeting, we haven't song to stay, 
Let our joys then be shining in the sweet right away. 
There's Tweed he is waiting for that sweet ny and bye, 
And Murphy skipped the gutter and took it on the fly, 
snd Mrs. Hicks she captured a " Lord" of high degree, 
And all upon the quiet they are singing merrily, 
Oh, the sweet right away, Oh, the sweet right away, 
That's the style all the while and the motto for die day, 
For life is but fleeting, Oh, make no delay, 
Let your joy f 
now be shining in the sweet right away.

THE STAGE.STRUCK FAMILY. 
11 
Written and sung with great success by BILLY Moonn, of 
MOOlts 8L DALY, Parody Singers. 
I've raised a 
family, there's just thirteen, 
From the eldest one, Dan, to the youngest just weaned: 
l've tried all my life to keep them at home, 
But you know that it's some children's nature to roam. 
There's the eldest one, Margaret, who is not yet of age. 
Ban away from her home, and went on the stage; 
But I 
can't blame her much, 'twas her nature you see, 
And, besides, every week she sends money to me. 
CEionus: 
I 
went last week to see her a 
dancing, 
I 
tell you, my bucko's, it was great fun; 
She came out on the stage with the music a 
prancinth 
And this is the kind of a 
dance that she done. 
(Dances a 
Fling). 
There's my son, Pat, he could never get fat, 
He'd dance on the corner from morning till night; 
He'd sing and he'd shout, and he'd wear his shoes out, 
And come home in the morning generally tight. 
Now, he has joined Haverly's big forty stars, 
He started away with them off on the cars; 
He wears a 
large diamond as big as my hat, 
I'm proud of my son, for an actor is Pat. 
CHORUS: 
When last he played here, I 
got chuck full of beer, 
And took all the family up to see the fun; 
The band gave a 
scream, and out came sixteen, 
And this is the kind of a 
dance that they done. 
(Dances a 
Clog). 
Sweet Camille. 
WritLen by Jerry Coburn. 
Sung with great succe 
by 
Billy Carter. 
In the back line of the ballet, 
Where I 
first met sweet Camille, 
As she tipped the light fantastic sweet and ga% 
And evening after evening 
I 
watched her skip along; 
One night I 
flipped by charmer a 
bouque*, 
And in it was a 
letter 
All scented up with mush, 
Requesting that she'd grant an interv-
:ew. 
She said that she would meet me 
Some evening at r 
dusk; 
So I 
went and ordered beer arid iced foi two. 
CHORUS. 
She had an appetite 
That was a 
daisy; 
She was hungry, she was dry, 
knd I 
couldn't say 
Where she ever put away, 
Or where she stowed the oysters, beer and pie 
So when the show was over, 
She took me to her house, 
A brown- stone front up in an alley-way 
She sat me in the parlor, 
And I 
heard her tell her ma, 
She'd caught another sardine sucker meaning me. 
When she washed with soap and water 
The powder 1.-om !aer face, 
13 
Her father then came in, and talked for half an hour or more, 
And she sat leaning all the while against the cupboard door, 
When the wine flask in my pocket broke and made a 
precious 
mess, 
Ran underneath the cupboard door, all round her new silk 
dress. 
CHORUS. 
For she wore silk she would you know, she would you know, 
she would, 
But then of course she would you know, she was just about 
the age. 
Her father saw the flowing wine, an 
said: " Sarah, what 
is that ?" 
She said: " Some jam and pickle jars are broken by the cat." 
He opened then the cupboard door, exclaiming, "'Who 
are you ?" 
And I 
was in a 
pickle, in a 
jam, and in a 
stew. 
CHORUS. 
The old man swore he would you know, he would you know, 
he would, 
But then of course he would you know, he was just about the 
age. 
He pulled me out and punched my head, then with good 
humor he, 
On hearing I 
was not bad 0U; 
invited me to tea, 
Since then I've married Sarah Green, and pleased I 
am to see, 
That she and all our little ones quite happy seem to be. 
CHORUS. 
But then of course she would you know, she would you know, 
she would, 
But then of course she would you know, she was just about 
the age.

PRETTY LITTLE TOMMY, 
Written and sung by BEN- DODGE. 
One afternoon as down the street I 
rambled, 
My attention was attracted by a 
crowd 
Of people, who with open mouths were list'ning 
To some language, which to me seemed very loud; 
It issued from a 
chap upon the corner, 
A 
fellow who was overstocked with cheek, 
He'd a 
little rubber toy which he was selling, 
And he said it was a " Tommy with a 
squeak." 
SPOKEN.—He pulled a 
string, causing the little rubber 
toy to move its arms and legs in a 
ridiculous manner, and 
at the same time to utter a 
very peculiar little squeak; then 
the gentleman would turn round to his audience and say— 
CHORUS. 
Will you buy a 
little Tommy with a 
squeak, squeak, 
squeak, 
Pull it for a 
week it will squeak, squeak, squeak; 
Buy a 
little Tommy with a 
squeak, squeak, squeak, 
Pretty little Tommy with a 
squeak. 
I 
purchased one, it was so very funny 
That I 
couldn't keep it hidden out of sight, 
At home we had a 
little boy in trowsers, 
Who had suffering been, and crying all the night; 
And the cause, I 
found, of all his youthful sorrow 
Was, he'd had the stomach-ache for near a 
week, 
But he laughed so loud, the pain at once departed, 
When I 
let him take the " Tommy with a 
squeak." 
Will you buy, etc. 
15 
For some time I 
have sojourned in this city, 
And of course I 
have been looking out for fun, 
I've desired with the girls to get acquainted, 
But they " turn me the cold shoulder "—every one; 
There is one by whom I 
have been captivated, 
And though to gain her notice I 
did seek, 
She somehow frowned on all of my advances, 
Till I 
showed the little " Tommy with a 
squeak !" 
SPOKEN.—That " 
broke the ice," for she turned around 
with an angelic smile and murmured— 
Pretty little Tommy, etc. 
Now advice in this matter I 
will give you, 
And I'm certain you will find it true indeed, 
If you try, and cannot win a 
girl's affections, 
Buy a 
little rubber toy, and you'll succeed ; 
For if when to plead your cause you would endeavor, 
Should the lady blush and hang her head so meek, 
She'll quickly smile and whisper yes so sweetly, 
When you show the little 
Tommy with a 
squeak 
Will you buy, etc.

DON'T 
SOME ONE WANT A 
WIFE ? 
Written and Sung by BILLY M OORE in character, with great success. 
: 
0: 
Oh, good evening, neighbors dear, sure I'm glad to see you 
here, 
And I 
hope you all will listen now, to what I'm going to 
say; 
I'm from Ireland as vou see, from the town of Skibboree, 
I'm a 
neat old Irish widow, and just in the prime of life. 
l'm not a 
woman of tishion, nor I'm not a 
woman of 
wealth, 
But I'm a 
stout old Irish girl that's always in good 
health: 
I 
can wash your clothes, or mend them, scrub the floor, or 
scour a 
knife, 
There's a 
chance for you, my darlings, now, don't some 
one want a 
wife? 
I've a 
house and I've a 
lot, I've a 
cow and the devil knows 
what, 
A 
stall down in the market, and keep potatoes that won't 
rot; 
'Iut there's one thing more I 
want, to make me happy all 
my life, 
There's a 
chance for you, Inv buckos, and don't sonic one 
want a 
wife? 
So now, kind friends, I 
niu-t be off, for this is market day, 
As no one wants me for a 
wife, a 
widow I 
must stay; 
But there's one thing I 
will do through this world of care 
and strife, 
I 
will never cease to holler out: Don't some one want a 
wife?

:itiug by 3. E. Mnspny, of M URPEtY & MACK, for seventy-live consecutive 
nights at the London Theatre, N. Y., in their great sketch, 
" 
The Christening." 
Our club is always noted for its larking and sparkin' 
Such dancin' and singin' and jolly sport have we; 
Our picnics bate them all without denial, a 
trial 
Would set you wild with pleasure at the Twilight Coterie. 
It's dance and prance, and catch the motion easy, 
And in a 
whirl, swing your girl, now we're off in style 
you see. 
And still the fiddle and the horns are soundin' while 
boundin' 
Are all the merry spielers of the Twilight Coterie. 
C
HORUS. 
Then it's on a 
summer's night in the park, my boys, 
Where the merry girls are singin' light and free, 
Hands around and round, and round, oh! what a 
lark, my 
boys, 
How the spielers prance, at the moonlight dance, of the 
Twilight Coterie. 
There's honored delegations from the " Starlights" and 
"Skylights," 
The " Ours" and " Yours" and other coteries, 
Together with their friends and their ladies, the daisies, 
Invited guest whose hearts are blessed with all the beer 
they please; 
It's skip and dip, and sachez round in glory, 
Oh, Bate asthore I 
bang the floor, that's the style of girl 
for me, 
And so around we balance, and each daisy is crazy 
Wid great hilarity, all at the Twilight Coterie.

Now Moses being my christian name, I 
used to feel afraid, 
And dreading something awful I 
for hours awake have laid, 
Sometimes I'd cry myself to sleep but horrid things I 
dreamed, 
For naughty ghosts at my bedside glared at me while they 
screamed: 
Cno:—Where was Moses when the light went out, &c. 
3. 
Upon the nurse I 
split and she was kindly asked to leave, 
But Moses Muggins married her for which we did not grieve, 
I 
met her in the street when she had just two days been wed, 
And didn't she warm my jacket when I 
innocently said: 
Cno:—Where was Moses when the light went out, &c. 
4. 
Some twenty years passed by before I 
heard the phrase again, 
Alone with a 
young lady I 
was riding in the train, 
We rushed into a 
tunnel and when all was pitchy dark, 
My lively little lady friend gave vent to this remark: 
Cno:—Where was Moses when the light went out, &c. 
5. 
Now when once more the light of day we saw to her I 
said, 
As you've 'waken'd up old memories you're the girl I'd like to 
wed, 
We're married now and six fine boys amuse us every night, 
And they never fail to ask when their Pa puts out the light: 
Cuo:—Where was Moses when th

LED ASTRAY. 
Written and composed by W . 
H. 
DEIZHANTT. 
Oh, let me speak, departing soul, 
E'er gone to ne'er return; 
That I 
may tell my wicked life 
To whom it may concern. 
It may, per chance, do some one good, 
And no one any harm; 
But block the road that leads to ruin, 
Wrought by fair woman's charm. 
The maiden, pure in innocence, 
Unknown to care and strife, 
May learn what comes of ignorance, 
To blast an holy life. 
And find a 
moral in this tale; 
For I 
was once as pure 
As snow, that scarce of Heaven fell 
But I 
am pure no more. 
I 
never knew a 
mother's love, 
Nor felt her tender care ; 
For she did give her life for me--
Ne'er blest me with a 
prayer. 
Though I 
was reared religiously, 
Was educated well, 
And moved in high society, 
Of which I 
blush to tell. 
Blush, said I? not blush, oh, no, 
I 
lost that with my name; 
And now but feel a 
justly throe, 
As one deluged in shame. 
I 
heard him promise faith and love, 
To share my life as well. 
In ignorance I 
sealed my fate. 
And so, alas, I 
fell. 
My father turned me from his door, 
And cruel words he said; 
My sisters dared not speak to me, 
So from the right I 
fled. 
Oh, curses on the promises 
That brightened all the way ; 
And false-eyed be that honeyed tongue 
That sweetened me astray. 
MORAL. 
Oh, innocence! oh, ignorance! 
Oh, youth! beware, beware! 
The path of love is beautiful, 
But ever hath a 
snare. 
E'en though ' tis decked with roses, 
The light of love adorns; 
Remember, where the flowers are, 
There's sure to be some thorn.

Flower From My Angel Mother's Grave.

Music copyrighted 1878, by Wm. H. KENNEDY, 128 Duffield street, 
Brooklyn, N. Y. 
Sung with great success by the German emperor, Gus W ILLIAMS. 
I've a 
casket at home that is filled with precious gems; 
I 
have pictures of friends dear to me, 
And I've trinkets so rare, that came many years ago. 
From my far distant home across the sea. 
But there's one sweet little treasure that I'll ever dearly prize, 
Better far than all the wealth beneath the wave; 
Tho' a 
small faded flow'ret, that I 
placed in childhood's days, 
'Tis a 
flower from my angel mother's grave. 
CHORUS. 
Treasured in my mem'ry like a 
happy dream, 
Are the loving words she gave, 
And my heart fondly cleaves to the dry and withered leaves--
'Tis a 
flower from my angel mother's grave. 
In the quiet country churchyard they laid her down to sleep; 
Close beside the old home she's at rest, 
And the low, sacred mound is enshrined within my heart, 
By the sweet ties of love forever blest. 
In the still and silent night I 
often dream of home again, 
And the visions ever tells me to be brave ; 
For the last link that binds me to the place I 
Jove so well, 
Is the flower from my angel mother's grave. 
Treasured in my mem'ry, &c.

I AM a

I

I'm not Champagne Charlie nor Tommy Coaloil. 
But you can see plain by my winning ways 
That I 
am a 
man that has seen better days. 
But for all tha, I 
don't care a 
straw, 
For I'm just aft; lively as ever, ha, ha! 
The pet of the girls I 
meet every day, 
And as they pass by me this is what they say:

Oh, my, ain't he a

Look at his walk—it's just like a

Oh dear, 1 
believe it is Grady! 
Look at his nice curly hair. 
Look at me well. 
Do I 
look green ? 
I 
have an eye that can capture a 
queen. 
With my graceful walk I 
make their heads whirl; 
My great Colorados the barbers do curl. 
I 
am a 
gambler at high jack and ' ow; 
I 
can play seven out and the great casino. 
There's no use in talking, now don't I 
look sweet?

When I 
see her sure my heart goes in a

She is thoroughly conversant wid the art of etiquette, 
And at cards she'd beat old Hoyle himself a 
game. 
Oh, she'd play you whist or cribbage, forty-fives or casino,

with unbounded applause. 
I'm not a 
wise man, but yet I'm no fool, 
I'm an American boy strong and hearty, 
I 
never mix up in political rings, 
I 
belong to the workingmen's party; 
There's the devil to pay in the papers each day, 
And half what you read may be true; 
But why people believe every word that they say, 
• 
I 
can't understand, can you? 
CHORUS: 
I

I 
don't understand, do you? 
Why Russia's great Czar was blown from Ws car, 
I 
can't understand, can you? 
Now there's Mr. Jones, my neighbor next door, 
Of a 
family he has quite a 
number; 
He's been married, I 
think about six years or more 
With six babies his life to encumber; 
While there is poor me, who's been wed about three 
And as yet there is nothing to show; 
But why such things should be, is quite funny to 
And I 
can't understand, can you? [me, 
CHORUS: 
I

Now there's General Grant, our Ex-President, 
He fought for the Star Spangled Banner; 
But the people do say that he'll fast forty days, 
For every one knows he's a 
Tanner; 
He has also been over Europe I'm told, 
They say he's as rich as a 
Jew; 
But why he don't retire to sweet private life, 
I 
can't understand, can you? 
CHORUS; 
I 
can't understand, can you? 
I 
don't understand, do you? 
Why we have a 
Mayor, by the way, who says 
Grace every day, 
I 
can't understand, can you? 
There's the handsome young lady, the belle of the 
day, 
Who is always dressed up in the fashion; 
Her beautiful form is developed to sight, 
She looks very stylish and dashing; 
With a 
sweet little bang on the front of her head, 
And she's made up quite pretty to view; 
But why she combs her hair on the back of a 
chair 
I 
can't understand, can you?

I 
don't understand, do you?

THE DONKEY. 
rirecds and Blusic by the late JAMES BRADLEY. 
As sung \ 
great success all over the country by TIM ROGERS. 
I'VE got a 
donkey, he stands six foot high, 
I'll sell to the man that wishes to buy. 
He drinks Seltzer Water whenever he's dry, 
In a 
race on the turf he has never proved shy; 
He makes good time—about one mile a 
day. 
I'll match him again any stallion or bay. 
He fought for his country, he's bee'. through the war; 
I 
feed him on herrings, hay, rope, and tar. 
CHORUS. 
I've got a 
donkey, he's not very chunky, 
I'll trade for a 
monkey, to any old flunkey, 
Now wouldn't that be hunky, if he had my donkey, 
And I 
had his monkey, my donkey also ? 
If he's locked in the stable he'll make a 
stiff kick; 
If he wants to get out he'll pretend he is sick; 
I 
call out my donkey—his name it is Dick. 
I 
coax him along with a 
hickory stick. 
If I 
leave in his box a 
big bale of hay, 
He'll eat it all up and leave none for next day. 
Last week he broke loose, and he got astray; 
He was found in a 
sewer in Avenue A. 
. 
I've got a 
donkey, etc, 
I 
harnessed him up last St. Patrick's day, 
I 
rode on his back so cheerful and gay, 
We started from the corner of Tenth and Broadway, 
We rode to the hall, without any delay. 
Just as we were passing by Central Park, 
A 
boy fired a 
pistol off, just for a 
lark, 
The donkey fell down, which caused a 
blockade, 
Only tor fifty horse-doctor he'd spoil the parade. 
I've got a

But a

So be aisy and free while you're drinking with me,

I've a

Oh, happy, contented is she: 
I've a 
thumping big lad that will say to his dad, 
There's a 
man you don't meet every day; 
And when for my leisure I'm out for a 
walk, 
The boys they all stop and they stare; 
And they say to each other as I'm passing by, 
There's a

Still sadly to my memory rushes, 
No matter where I

Written by EDWARD HARRIGAN. Dedicated to JOHNSON & SWAIN 
Behold these old time heroes, 
With hair as white as snow; 
We fit with Hickory Jackson, 
In Louisiana, low, low, low. 
We waited on the generals, 
And kept the powder dry; 
And stayed way back dar in the rear, 
We did not care to die, die. 
CHORus: 
Clare de track, plea% stand back, 
The old vets mighty glad; 
Dress yourself in bran new clothes, 
And bring along your dad, dad, dad. 
Hoist your umbrella's high. 
The wind ain't gwine to blow; 
Hush your mouths when old folks talk 
Of eighty years ago. 
Dare was de British general, . 
Oh, didn't we give him beans; 
When we lay behind cotton-bales, 
Down at New Orleans, Leans, Leans. 
De colored troops fought nobly, 
The guns went a-la-ba-zarn; 
We knocked de s,:cks clean off de heels 
Of General Packingham, ham, ham.

Though we aid our lame companions, 
Who are plunged in deepest strife.

To a

Has a

In this bustling world of care.

But, alas! ' tis soon forgotten

She smiles and bows her head, 
To the piano she lightly treads, 
And all those loyely songs she sings to me.

JOLLY GOOD LUCK TO ALL. 
Sang by NED BARRY at HARRIGAN & ILLaT's Theatre Comique. 
Music published at E. 
H. 
HARDINGS, 229 Bowery. 
If I 
had the power a 
gift to bestow, 
On the friends that around me I 
see, 
I'd give them the very best gift that I 
know, 
The gift that they lucky should be; 
For no matter how clever, how foolish, how wise, 
No matter how great, or how small; 
By luck more than merit, we fall or we rise, 
So, here's jolly good luck to us all. 
CHORUS: 
Here's jolly good luck to us all, my friends, 
The best of good luck to us all; 
For by luck more than merit, we rise or we fall, 
So, here's jolly good luck to us all. 
One man may be gifted with talents divine, 
But may still in obscurity live; 
While shallower mortals successfully shine, 
And take all the world has to give; 
One waits on in vain, for good fortune's caress, 
While the other some chance may befall; 
Which used to advantage results in success, 
So, here's jolly good luck to us all. (Chorus). 
So, up and be doing, deserving good luck, 
And good fortune may favor the brave; 
For some of life's prizes are won by sheer pluck, 
And are lost by the indolent slave; 
There is always one chance in the life of a 
man, 
Which, if lost, he can never recall; 
So work for it, watch for it, hope if you can, 
That there's jolly good luck for us all. (Chorus).

There's a 
girl of high degree upon whom I 
am awfully stuck, 
She dances in the ballet, while her father drives a 
truck ; 
Her mother she peddles lemonade, her brother he slings hash, 
Vet the neighbors say most every day, Johanna's on the mash. 
CHORUS. 
Johanna Louisa McGuire 
Is a 
girl that you all could. admire 
She's a 
voice like a 
bell, 
Though I 
never could tell 
Where she got it or how, 
Yet you all do allow 
That Johanna Louisa McGuire 
Has something that you all would desire, 
For she's awfully gay on St. Patrick's day, 
Is Johanna Louisa McGuire. 
f)he inhabits a 
little zky parlor up an alley where everything's 
snug, 
Her furniture's very antique, a 
table, three chairs and a 
jug. 
I 
one evening at the window sat as her invited guest. 
From the alley below some young devil did throw a 
cud of 
Jackson's best. 
SPOKEN.—It 
struck the girl bang in the eye, the old yellow 
Jack molasses tobacco. 
I 
was about to sympathize with her,

and THOMPSON at the Windsor Theatre. 
I-14re we are two Hebrew politicians, 
When we run for office we got terrible opposition 
From every creed that is known in existence, 
We are the Hebrew politicians of the day. 
When election time does come, lots of promises we do 
make; 
You should see them Hebrew voters how our money 
they do take, 
To go and cast their ballots, 'cause they know we take 
the cake, 
We're the Hebrew politicians of the day. 
CHORUS. 
When we go out we dress up nice and neat, 
We eat a 
piece of garlic, to make our breath smell 
sweet ; 
And the gang upon the corner holler, " Sheeneys, float 
your feet," 
We're the Hebrew politicians of the day. 
We are going to run for Alderman upon the next elec-
tion; 
Cast your eyes upon us—do yoit think we'll pass in-
spection ? 
And if you want to vote for us, we won't have no 
obj ection, 
We're the Hebrew politicians of the day. 
And when we are elected we will do the best we can, 
We'll give a 
good day's wages to every working man; 
And the people all will'say, " For them Sheeneys hip, 
hurrah, 
They're the Hebrew politicians of the day."

You will please to give me your attention, 
For just a 
little while; 
Until I 
with pleasure mention her, 
" 
The Belle of imberisle." 
She's the neatest and the sweetest maiden 
My heart could ever choose, 
And if I 
now sing and dance with joy 
I 
trust you will excuse. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, when I 
hear the music play 
I 
feel so happy I 
could throw mycelf away; 
Yes, I 
feel so good I 
can't keen from singing, 
My joy it is profuse, 
And the heeltaps will keep ringing, but, 
I 
trust you will excuse. 
I 
shall ne'er forget the moonlight picnic 
They gave at " Amberisle;" 
How the pleasures were ecstatic for 
The best of " bon ton" style. 
It was there I 
met my heart's best treasure, 
" 
Sweet idol of my muse," 
And when I 
asked to see her home 
She said " I 
can't refuse." 
(sym.) 
(synt.) 
Oh, when I 
hear, etc. 
Just the other day I 
popped the question, 
She said " I 
can't decline," 
So a 
cottage on the Hudson banks 
Will be her home and mine. 
We invite you all to call and see us, 
And hope you won't refuse; 
And if kindness fails to greet you there, 
I 
trust you will excuse. 
Oh, when I

The Lads Who Live in Ireland. 
OR, WHERE THE APPLE PRATIES GROW. 
As Sung by DAN NASH, the Great Character Artist. 
My name is Ned O'llanney, I 
was born in sweet Kilarney, 
I 
can fight, dance or sing, I 
can plow, reap or mow; 
And if I 
meet a 
pretty girl, I 
never practice blarney. 
I've something more alluring, which perhaps you'd like to knovh 
VIII none of your Bulgrudderies, nor other shabby families, 
But can unto my pedigree a 
pretty title show; 
Oh 1 
I'm of the O's and Macs, and likewise the sturdy Whacks. 
Crtonus. 
That live and toil in Ireland, where the Apple Patties grow; 
That live and toil in Ireland, where the Apple Poetics grow, 
I 
could a 
deal relate, if I 
could but trace my pedigree : 
My Mother was a 
Hogan, but my Father I 
don't know; 
I've ninety-nine relations in a 
place they call Roscarberry, 
kiad each unto their name hasfa-Mac or an 0; 
My Uncle was a 
Brallaghan, my Aunt she was a 
Callaghan; 
And as to my character, why, I 
can plainly show, 
I'm a 
rantin' rovin' blade, and I 
never was afraid, 
For I 
was born In Ireland, Szs. 
May Hem en still protect our hospitable Country, 
Where first I 
drew my living breath, and heard its cocks to crow. 
Adieu to its green hills and its lovely Bay of Bantry I 
Where many a 
pleasant evening, my love and I 
did go. 
Where shoals of fish, so pleasantly, did sport about so merrily, 
Beneath its glassy surface, their wanton tricks to show, 
Oh I 
those scenes I 
did enjoy like a 
gay unthinking boy, 
With the lade who live in Ireland, lee. 
St. Patrick was our Saint, and a 
blessed man, in truth was he: 
Great gifts unto our Country he freely did bestow; 
He banished all the frogs and toads that sheltered in ou: Country, 
And unto other regions it's they were forced to go ; 
There is one fact undoubtedly, that cannot contradicted be; 
For, trace the Irish history, and it will plainly show: 
Search the universe all round, tighter fellows can't be found,

717 Broadway, N. Y. 
Oh my name is Gilhooly Cornelius Gilh000ly, 
I 
live on the 1st Avenue; 
I'm a 
hard working man from the dear Irish land, 
With a 
heart that is honest and true; 
Every night just before I

I 
call to my wife " ducky" dear; 
Run around to Maguire's, it's now I 
desire, 
The Little Brown Pitcher of Beer. 
CHORUS: 
The Little Brown Pitcher of Beer, Mollie, 
The Little Brown Pitcher of Beer; 
Whem I'm dry it will fill me with cheer, Mollie, 
The Little Brown Pitcher of Beer. 
Then we sit down together and talk of the weather, 
And tell the events of the day; 
When the pitcher is empty, we fill it again, 
And in pleasure the night flies away; 
The place where we live is a 
fine Irish flat, 
And our neighbors are full of good cheer; 
If you want to be happy, just come and imbibe, 
From the Little Brown Pitcher of Beer. 
You may talk of your wines with their high sounding 
names, 
Whisky Punches and Hot Spicy Rum; 
But the Beer is the stuff, and it's quite good enough, 
For your Senses it can't overcome; 
If my friends call around, they'll have pleasure and 
fun, 
On a 
Christmas or happy New Year; 
We'll bring out Glass Goblets and off I 
will go, 
For the Little Brown Pitcher of Beer.

Music by GEO. CAREY. 
Sung by CAREY anti 
H AMLIN with great success in all the principle theatres South. 
Here we are two jovial lads from merry England shore, 
We never shall forget the time we crossed the ocean o'er, 
And landed in America, the place to us so dear, 
To show the people one and all the dance of Lancashire. 
CHORUS. 
So watch us while we execute the time and you will hear, 
The music in the dancing of the lads from Lancashire. 
We took to dancing when we were two little baby boys, 
And though the years have past and gone 'tis still our only joy, 
We are just as happy as can be as on through life we jog, 
One greatest feat in (lancing is the jig the reel, and clog. 
So watch us, &c. 
So now we've done our best to please we'll bid you all adieu, 
And hope we'll meet some future time our friendship to renew, 
We've showed you all those little steps to Englishmen so dear, 
So now we'll do the champion seven that's done in Lancashire. 
So watch us, & c. 
The Little Blonde in Blue. 
Words and music by PETER GALE, of the AMERICAN FOUR. 
While rambling in the country, 
Not many weeks ago, 
I 
espied a 
cottage by a 
stream, 
Where crystal waters flow, 
And passing by the garden, 
Where lovely flowers grew, 
I 
saw a 
beauty at the gate, 
A 
llttle blonde in blue. 
Cnonus. 
In form and features she was fair, 
Her eyes an azure hue, 
I 
can't forget the day I 
met, 
The little blonde in blue. 
We stood awhile conversing, 
Her voice was soft and mea, 
While the dimples in her rosy cheeks 
They played hide and seek. 
She saw I 
admired her pretty flowers, 
She gave to me a 
few, 
I 
stoic a 
kiss, but gave it back 
To the little blonde in blue. 
(Chorus.) 
We rambled down a 
graveled walk, 
Enclosed by hedges green, 
I 
asked her if she'd change her name 
As the moon began to beam. 
And on her homeward journey, 
She promised to be true, 
I 
blessed the happy day I 
met 
The little blonde in blue. 
(Chorus.)

The prettiest girl in all this town lives just across the way 
I'm going to call on her and see if she will name the day; 
She is very sweet on both of us, which one she cannot say, 
Snell a 
pretty girl is Katie Ann O'Connor. 
She promised to be mine, and said how happy we would be 
Before I 
went away she said she loved no one but me; 
She may be fooling both of us, but now we're going to sea 
Which one shall wed Miss Katie Ann O'Connor. 
CHORUS; 
Katie Ann O'Connor she is the prettiest girl I 
know, 
Katie Ann O'Connor said I 
might be her beau; 
She is sweeter than the flowers that in the garden grow, 
Such a 
pretty girl is Katie Ann O'Connor. ( Repeat). 
Now all the boys around the town have got her on the brain 
The girls they are so jealous that they're mighty near insane; 
But Katie she don't notice it, she loves me just the same, 
Such a 
pretty girl is Katie Ann O'Connor. 
So now we are going to leave you, and will come som e 
other time, 
And when we do, we'll let you know when the marriage 
bells does chime; 
To the wedding we'll invite you all, and won't we have a 
time, 
With this pretty girl, Miss Katie Ann Ok'onnor.

Sweet-Scented Handsome Young Man, 
(Kew air.) 
Written and composed by SAM DEVERE, and sung by him 
with immense success. 
Copyrighted 1876, by A. 
J. 
FISHER, 98 Nassau St., New York. 
There's a 
sweet-scented handsome young man in this town, 
His name is Theophilus Aristides Brown. 
With weak-minded females he's gained some renown, 
This sweet- scented handsome young man. 
He's as dainty as a 
butterfly, and in colors as gay, 
And flutters from corner to corner all day. 
He's too sweet for anything, that's what the girls say, 
Of this sweet-scented handsome young man. 
CHORUS. 
He wears a 
red neck- tie, his complextion is fair, 
Straight down from the middle he parts his blonde hair. 
He skips o'er the gutter like a 
thing made of air, 
This sweet-scented handsome young man. 
There's a 
few straggling hairs upon his upper lip, 
His legs are the size of a 
two cent tallow dip, 
He looks like a 
chicken that's just had the pip, 
This sweet- scented handsome young man. 
If caught in the rain he would surely expire, 
Gotten up expressly for girls to admire, 
-
 
He could jump through a 
sieve without touching a 
wire, 
Could this sweet- scented handsome young man. 
He wears a 
red neck tie, ie. 
To break the girls' hearts is his object 'twould seem, 
By day its his hobby, by night its his dream; 
His chief food is sponge cake, root beer and ice cream, 
This sweet- scented dainty young man. 
Such effiminate young men may be all very fine, 
Their attention all clear headed girls will decline 
I'll be darn'd if he could marry any sister of mine, 
No such sweet- scented handsome young man. 
He wears a 
red neck tie. tee.

Tell Me Love, Will You Remember? 
Duet sung with great success by the VirnrrxET's, in their original 
sketch, " Rehearsal in the Parlor." 
Tell me love, will you remember 
When I'm far away from thee ? 
Will you still be true my darling, 
When I'm sailing o'er the sea, 
Keep the vows of love we plighted 
When we bade our last farewell, 
That you'll keep me in remembrance, 
Tell me, darling, only tell ? 
CHORUS. 
Whisper softly, sweetly, darling, 
Say I 
will be true to thee, 
Though for years we may be parted, 
Promise to remember me. 
Tell me love, will you remember 
When the roses cease to bloom? 
And December, bleak and dreary, 
Takes the place of gentle June. 
Though we may be parted, darling, 
By the cruel hand of time, 
Promise that you will be true, love, 
'Till I 
come to call you mine.

Parody on Eldest Daughter Clara. 
Composed and sung by Pam, DaEssEn. 
I've a 
beautiful mother-in-law, 
She looks like a 
butcher shop Sign: 
She always looks neat and such beautiful feet, 
And her shoe is a 
small number nine; 
When she does the coffee-pot act, 
And powders herself with a 
broom; 
If you'd see her face, be heavens you'd swear 
That her breath would keep up a 
balloon. 
Cnonus: 
She waltzes me round upon my nose,—(Break.) 
She kicks the buttons all off my clothes.—(Break.) 
When she makes her appearance boys, 
Like Tom cats, we fight and we claw: 
Tom Allen, he never would stand a 
chance, 
In front of my mother-in-law. 
She had a 
desire to go on the stage, 
And be an actress of fame; 
She wanted to call herself Madam Loosecheese, 
When McGuinness that was her right name: 
You could hear her shout for four blocks away, 
This beautiful lemonade star; 
Three neighbors of ours went to the asylum, 
On account of my mother-in-law. 
She gave imitations of Sarah Bernhardt, 
On the clarionet she tried to spiel: 
One night she threw up a 
pair of susuendersi, 
In the death scene of the play called Camille. 
Her style was very much like Nis. Morris 
In her acting you'd not find a 
flaw; 
Jack Haverly offered her a 
dollar a 
night, 
So that croaked my poor mother- in, law.

In the air when he was eighty-three.

DUNCAN, the hit of the sfnotot 
at the Metropolitan Theatre, Louisville, Ky. 
usic copyrighted and published by R. A. SAALFIELD, 839 Wway, 1. 
Some think that life the most jolly 
Is found in a 
smoky town, 
But give me the glorious country, 
Where one can get healthy and brown. 
I 
like it now better than ever, 
I'll tell you the reason why— 
If you think I'm blind, perhaps 
am, 
For I've got a 
sweet girl in my eye. 
CHORUS. 
Down, down by the old water mill, 
Close by the side o, a 
rippling rill, 
In a 
dear little cottage just under the hill, 
That's where I 
met with my darling. 
She showed me the ducks and the drakes, 
She showed me the cocks and the hens, 
She showed me the shovels and rakes, 
And the dear little ba's in their pens. 
She showed me the birds and the bees, 
And likewise the pigs and the sows, 
She showed me the butter and cheese, 
And also the bulls and thc cows. 
Down, down, &c. 
The ducks they would waddle to greet her, 
The geese made a 
terrible row, 
The cocks and the hens raced to meet her, 
And merrily grunted the sow. 
She feeds them from out of her apron, 
Her kindness to all never fails, 
Whenever she passes a 
bull or a 
cow 
They're sure to waggle their tails. 
Down, down, &c.

Allow me to Bee you Home. 
Sung by EDWIN BARRY at the Theatre Comique, New '
ork< 
They say I'm a 
desperate flirt, 
A 
gay and a 
festive young man; 
I 
admit it and boldly assert 
I 
will have all the pleasure I 
can; 
I 
admire pretty faces and feet, 
And whenever chance leads me to roam, 
If a 
sweet pretty girl I 
should meet, 
I 
insist upon seeing her home. 
CHORUS. 
Allow me to see you home, 
That is if I 
don't intrude, 
No matter how far, so pretty you are, 
I 
hope you'll not think that I'm rude: 
Oh do let me see you home 
You sweet little scrumcious maid, 
You've nothing to fear you sweet little dear, 
Come along and don't be afraid. 
Sometimes the fair creatures say " yes 1" 
And often decidedly " no;" 
'Tis then I 
endeavor to press. 
Until they allow me to go; 
Then I 
secretly wonder how far, 
• 
Sometimes it's a 
duced long way, 
I 
then think what fools we men are I 
But still I 
continue to say 
Allow me to see you home, &c. 
One night I 
was had for a 
mark 
And felt just a 
little bit small, 
'Twas a 
girl that I 
met in the Park, 
A 
beautiful figure so tall; 
She allowed me to stand her champagne, 
And pay for a 
cab to her door, 
Then advised me to run home again 
As she did'nt want anything more. 
SPOKEN.—Pretty thing to tell a 
fellow after standing supper, 
paying cab fare eight and a 
half miles; told me to run home 
again; bounced in and shut the door in my face. 
I 
declared 
that should be the last girl I 
should see home, but I 
scarcely 
got twenty yards from the house when I 
met another fair 
creature. 
I 
said " Ahem, rather late to be alone, miss." 
No answer, so I 
raised my hat and said, " I 
beg pardon miss 
but— 
Allow me to see you home, &c.

As sung by SCANLAN it CRONIN. 
My name it is Mike Slattery, 
And from Ireland I 
came, 
And I've a 
son who's a 
big blackguard, 
And Terrence is his name; 
He wears a 
gold watch and chain, 
And lie calls it a super," and a " slang," 
Oh ! my heart is broke, God knows it is, 
Since Terry first joined the " gang." 
CHORUS. 
He'll come rolling home in the mornkig, 
And he'll give the door the divil's own bang,- 
Oh! my heart is brok,s, God knows it is, 
Since Terry first joined the " gang." 
When lie came home last Thursday night, 
Sure I 
talked to him very nice: 
When he said old man! you're getting to fresh, 
And we 11 soon have to put you on ice! 
lie told the old woman for to take a 
drop, 
And to shut up giving him her slang; 
Oh! her heart is broke, God knows it is, 
Since Terry first joined the ' gang" 
He'll come rolling home, itc. 
Sure, he stands upon the corner, 
From morning until night ; 
And if the policeman says 
move on," 
He'll spit at hint with spite. 
He went to the market only yesterday, 
And there he stole a 
hi, ham ; 
And he got three months in the Penitentiary, 
Along with the rest of the " gan,7!"

NEW YORK. 
the Greatest Trick Book of the Age. 
1-1111IPTY DIMPTY, 
IT PLEASES BOTH OLD AND YOUNG, 
ft is a 
Fac simile of a 
Trick practiced by a1,4 
the Professors of Magic. 
It is arranged so systematically, and is accom-
panied with directions so plainly written, that, with 
a 
single perusal, any person may become an adept 
in an unfailing source of amusement. 
Read what a leading Journal says of it: 
" 
An ingenious little book of the thaumaturgic order 
has been sent us, called Hum-PrY DumPry,' and bound 
in such a 
way as to give opportunity for a 
decidedly 
puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary appear-
ance of a 
child's picture-book, gayly printed and colored, 
it is so bound that a 
practiced manipulator, taking it 
up, and flirting the leaves rapidly over, can make it ap-
pear to be filled with copies of only one piature, or with 
blank pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of 
figures. 
One minute the pamphlet, quickly thumbed, 
appears to contain nothing but portraits of Harlequin, 
in his tesselated suit; the next, only Columbine; then, 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or Mephisto-
pheles. 
A little practice, and the directions printed 
with the book will make anybody at home in the hand.
