Undine Bereton interviewed by Christine Lewis 
00:05.1 
Interviewer: Hi, my name is Christine Lewis and we're doing archiving the voices of the women, 
Domestic Workers United women in the Library of Congress with the Archie Green grant. What 
is your name? 
My name is Undine Bereton. 
00:23.2 
Interviewer: And where are you from, Undine? 
I'm from Trinidad and Tobago. 
00:28.1 
Interviewer: What brought you to the United States? 
I would say a better life for myself and my children. 
01:00.1 
Interviewer: What is a better life to you? 
A better life is like my interpretation of a better life was at a time because of the devaluation of 
the Trinidad and Tobago dollars it was the multiplication of the US--to one US to the Trinidad 
dollar. 
01:00.1 
Interviewer: And what year was that? What are you talking about? So would you say that that 
was the neoliberal policies that brought people from whence they came to the United States in 
search of that better life that you're talking about? 
I would say 1990 something. When I was in Trinidad my mom had visited the US and they all 
came back with the idea that, 'It's so nice, things are cheap.' I never had it at the time in my 
thought to come to the US but I think curiosity got the best of me at one point and I decided, 
'Well, let me go see.' So I did go and get a visa and come here to the United States. 
02:01.3 
Interviewer: So what borough do you live in here now? 
Kingsborough.

Interviewer: What is your current occupation? 
 
My current occupation is nanny/geriatric caregiver/consultant/health coach. I'm a woman of 
many hats. 
 
02:37.2 
Interviewer: So how did you become a domestic worker? Well, and with all that you do how did 
you become a nanny--and that is in the genre of domestic worker--right? And what is a 
domestic worker if you may before you answer that question. But in you saying that--not all 
workers are undocumented, people have the notion that every domestic worker is an 
undocumented worker, it's not true, right? 
 
A domestic worker, for me, is someone who works in someone else's home. And how I became 
a domestic worker? Is because coming from my country the standard of education that we had 
and coming here it was in doubt. Trinidad and Tobago. And most people think that we are 
uneducated, so when we come here it is being questioned, so because of that we have to take 
the backseat and take whatever job--what meager job--we could get at the time in order to 
provide for our family in our country. So we come to the US even if we went to University of the 
West Indies or we have a degree or we have high school education, we still have to go ride back 
and because we don't have money and are undocumented we have to take the next best thing 
that is available. Cleaning houses. That is not true. Domestic workers, there are a lot of 
domestic workers who are documented, the majority, that is to say. 
 
04:41.2 
Interviewer: So how long have you been doing this work then? A nanny, a geriatric/consultant 
and also the nanny work? I don't know if I asked you this question: How did you become a 
domestic worker? Did I ask you that question? But to all of us though, I mean as you talk about 
the educational attainment when you come from where you come from you have to start at the 
bottom as you say, and I don't want to put words in your mouth, it's your story. And you've 
done the work for 15 years? 
 
The nanny and the geriatric elderly care, I have done it for more than 15 years. More than 15 
years. No, you didn't. I became a domestic worker because that's all that was available to me at 
the time. More than 15 years, yes. 
 
05:39.1 
Interviewer: So how many positions have you had? And that entails what, apart from the nanny 
work? 
 
I've had a number of positions. It's numerous. I can't specifically say how much, but I would say 
more than 10 jobs domestically speaking. Elderly care, house cleaning/housekeeping.

Interviewer: What motivated you to be a part of this project, however? The archiving of the 
voices? It's your story, though, and stories are riveting. And this is not "The Help," from the 
book that you read, "The Help," right? Well it kind of parallels that, right, if we may? 
What motivated me the most is for--I want the world to know and hear what's going on in our 
lives as domestic workers. The world needs to know, Congress needs to know, all the powers at 
be need to know what we face on a daily basis. And this is a narrative. A definition of a 
narrative is a true story of something that happened to you in particular. No, this is--I've never 
read the book and I have never seen the movie if there's a movie. Maybe it does, if that is what 
"The Help" has in it, but I've never seen the movie, I've never read the book. 
 
07:14.1 
Interviewer: So walk me through a typical daily routine of your day-to-day responsibilities. But 
what do you mean the mother can't handle the baby and it's her baby? 
 
As a nanny, I would first say as a nanny my day-to-day schedule would be like: I go into work, 
the time varies, it could be 7:30, it all depends if parents have something important to do or go 
away one parent is there by themself to go away then here comes the nanny, could you come 
in earlier on this particular day to help out? And 7:30, 8:00, no later than 8:00. It could be 
earlier. I have had jobs where I go in like 6:30 when father one parents probably travels and 
mom is there and she cannot handle the baby so I have instances where they would ask me to 
come in. The thing about it, it's her baby yes, but I would say I stepped in not filling the void, 
per se, as parent, but indirectly yes, filling that void, because a mom might have a baby, yes, by 
name by title, but how many hours does that mother spend with her baby when the nanny is 
there? That is me. So I come in at 8. The baby wakes up.  
 
Most moms want the baby to be up by 7. The time keeps on dropping lately, they want their 
sleep, they don't want to wake up early so they want the baby to sleep longer, and I have that 
from being a baby nurse myself, and they leave for work in a rush as though something is 
chasing them and here I am with the baby and I have the baby right through the day, right 
through the day, they come home at 6:00 or 6:30, they're always late, and here I am. The baby 
goes down at 7. Now I spend most of the time that the baby is up with the baby.  
 
10:03.1 
Interviewer: So give me an example or paradigm of that daily work with that baby. Could you 
outline? House technician. I think Jill. And by this time you've read Harry and the Purple Crayon 
five times, right? Or ready for his or her parent, right? Who he hasn't seen in the entire day. 
Yes, I could. I get in there, I open the door, I always show respect. Whatever job I'm doing, I 
show respect, so I say good morning, because I just don't want to walk in unannounced and 
startle anyone, so I will say good morning and if I don't see anybody or hear anyone, mommy or 
daddy will probably be with the baby and I take over, because the baby is always placed in my 
arms rather quickly, so I take over and I change the baby, get the baby dressed, I feed the baby, 
then I will pack the baby bag, wash the bottle, because the sink is always filled with bottles and 
baby breakfast and everything is waiting, everything is a total mess.

I think as a nanny, I was working like nanny/housekeeper/you name it. House technician. And 
fix it. Yeah, I was Jack of all trade. Jill and Jack too when Jack was not there. So I was wearing 
many hats on a given day as a nanny. So I would come in, take the baby, feed the baby, dress 
the baby, pack the bag, get the bottles, empty the dishwasher, load it, put the garbage out, 
then put the baby in the stroller on a normal day, and then we go out. We go out to the parks 
and the museums and that different places, then I would come back in with the baby at a 
certain point, feed the baby again, the same old routine, wash the bottles, clean, do everything, 
and it's a cycle. Then I put the baby down to take a nap in the crib because moms want the 
babies to sleep in the crib, I have to vacuum the house, make sure everything is clean. All the 
dirty laundry that is spilled all over, including underwears and briefs and you name it, I have to 
gather them up nicely and do the laundry, fold it, and here comes baby up again, 'Wah wah 
wah,' crying all over and I have baby on one shoulder and my hand is filled with hot laundry 
trying to carry there, it's spilling all over and the whole cycle at the end of the day, mummy 
comes, the house is clean, baby is well fed, baby is clean, baby is in his or her pajamas.  
 
I have read Green Eggs and Ham a million times. I know the words. I know all the storybooks. 
Dr. Seuss, you name it. Thanks to Dr. Seuss the late great writer and the baby's just ready, so 
exhausted too and ready and tired of me I guess and ready for bed. By that time mummy who 
leaves me, mummy is super exhausted she claims that she is so tired so she just don't want that 
baby to be crying or up. The cycle begins. 
 
13:47.3 
Interviewer: So what skill do you need to be a domestic worker? What skill is there to be 
needed? Is that in any book, though? So on that note, what training is necessary to be a 
successful domestic worker, if any? Well, you said before, motherhood that prepares you for 
that. Is that in a book, though? We should have patience?  
 
A skill of motherhood. No, that's in the book of experience. As a mother myself, that's what I 
brought to the table, that's how I was able to get a job. The skill of being a mother. I went to 
the university of motherhood. A head and a body and elbow grease, to be free that means 
working your ass off, working hard. Once you can do that, it doesn't matter if you could talk 
English, Spanish, or Dutch. Patience. They don't have patience. We nannies have patience. We 
graduate with our master's and PhD in patience and psychology.  
 
15:32.0 
Interviewer: So is there some specialty or expertise that you have? Yeah, or--yeah, what 
specialty do you bring to the table? What was the dream? To be precise, to be concrete as 
opposed to being abstract, what that dream was to? So in your summarization, that is the 
expertise and specialty that you bring to the table? Why common sense, though? Do you want 
to elaborate? And babies will cry that's part of a developmental skill, right?  
 
As a nanny? I bring a lot of specialties. When I came to the United States, I had dreams, just like 
Martin Luther had dreams, I had dreams too myself, I just did not waltz in here a little black 
woman from Trinidad and Tobago without any specialties. I came here as I said, with dreams, so 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
4
I wanted to--that dream is to be the best I could be no matter what I do, be the best at it. So if I 
was a nanny, I would be the best nanny, if I was a housekeeper or cleaner, I was the best 
housekeeper/housecleaner, if I was a geriatric attendant, I would be the best, if I had to scrub 
the floor, it would be the cleanest floor ever. And common sense, don't forget, least but not 
last.  
 
Yes, I want to elaborate, because without common sense--I'm not only dealing with the child, 
I'm dealing with the parents. They ask us some questions as if they never went to school. For 
instance: 'Why is the baby crying?' Every time I have to be saying, 'The baby cries because the 
baby cannot say, 'Oh, my diaper is wet or I'm hungry.' They're always asking, 'Why?' It is a part 
of developmental skills. Baby will cry to announce themself, 'Here I am, because I cannot say 
words yet, but I know to cry, I want to be held, I want love, I want to be fed, I'm upset for 
whatever reason.' That's how they speak, by crying--that's where common sense--until they can 
speak. 
 
18:21.1 
Interviewer: Is there any special skill you might have taught your employer? And I need to 
check--it comes back to as you say, common sense, right? Sounds like fiction, right? So I like to 
say, do you think it's mother's wit? I mean, I kind of come up with this fairly recent. They're 
telling you how to do and as you say you come, your skill you came with was being a mother. 
[unclear.] kids, right? Yeah, so that's why I say a mother's wit. So what is the specialty, though, 
in all that that you brought to that household or wherever you worked with, wherever your 
experiences were? What was that specialty or expertise that you bring? So is there any special 
skill, again we come back, that you might have taught your employer apart from saving the 
baby's life, is there anything else that you brought to that household? Could you single out 
one? What cord is that? Specially the creases, right, that can burst and cut? Because those little 
creases, those little dimpling of the skin can become infected, right? And you're the nanny, the 
baby nurse--to think of it.  
 
I would say yes. I am not trying to be giving myself self-praises or anything, but in many families 
that I have worked with, when I see that they don't know, here they have a baby or a child and 
there is no paper or leaflet that comes with the baby that says, 'This is what you have to do, this 
is what you have to give in case of that, that is what you have,' there is no--no, babies don't 
come with that, unfortunately, so that's where I come in. Many parents, I have to show them 
how to put the diaper on so it's the basic how to put the diaper on the baby the correct way, 
because I've seen many parents turn the diaper backwards, the opposite way, and I have--
common sense. And I taught how to burp the baby, for them to go and learn the basic thing.  
 
I had one family specifically who were in the medical field and the baby was choking on a toy 
and I was about to go through the door and I just heard my name screamed. When I rushed 
back in because I was taking off, I was about to take the top that I normally carry--the sort of 
clothes that I wear, because children, they spit up a lot and they're dirty, with a nanny we don't 
have a three-piece suit, we have our whatever clothes we go with is filthy at the end of the day. 
So I normally would carry--in order to look a little presentable walking down the street going 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
5
home in the afternoon--I would normally carry a T-shirt or you know something to substitute, 
and as I was about to pull that over my head, I heard my name called, I rushed out to the mom, 
'What happened, what happened?' because she was all panicked and here I am standing in my 
jeans and brassier and thank god I had worn a good bra that day, otherwise--and the baby was 
turning blue.  
 
It might sound like fiction, but when I looked in her face I knew everything was not okay, so I 
rushed in and grabbed the baby--thank god I know CPR--I turn the baby over and I hit the baby 
some good pat on the back quickly and the object just flew out and the baby let out a shrill cry 
and then I knew the baby was alright so it was fine, and up to today she tells everyone, 'Oh, you 
saved my baby's life.' And she had just finished her CPR like three months prior to that incident, 
working in a medical field-- Yes, never had a doctorate before, never had a master's in anything 
before, prior. Mother's wit/common sense. It was an expertise of inner knowledge. Things I 
have known unconsciously. A lot, a lot I have said. Yes.  
 
I have many instances, but on this specific instant I remember quite vividly working as a baby 
nurse and the cord, the baby's cord--number one, they didn't want to pay me to stay a long 
period of time, because they were already underpaying me, so I decide, well look, I'm not 
sleeping in the night and I'm not sleeping in the day while they're asleep, so I asked to leave so I 
left, the cord did not fall. The umbilical cord of the baby. So, because they didn't want to pay so 
I asked to leave, I wasn't sleeping. When I left now they were in a fright, because they called. 
'Oh, there is blood coming from around the baby--' better known as the navel--and I rushed 
back. In two days’ time I was back and the smell, it was the smell that was coming from there, I 
have to clean it even though I had been cleaning it all those days with the alcohol and the Q-
tips, she wasn't--the mom wasn't maintaining it--so I have to clean it properly and within two 
days of when I was back there, the cord fell off and I continued cleaning in order to give the 
baby the first bath.  
 
So on many of my jobs, I have to show the new moms the basic how to swaddle the baby, how 
to bathe the baby, how to clean all the different parts of the baby. Mother's work. As small as 
the baby--and newborns, some of them poop or defecate or have BM regularly and sometimes 
they get so irritated so that's basically common sense, how to put the nice little paste to keep 
the area from being damp all the time and wet, put the aquafor and the Vaseline and the 
different things to keep the baby comfortable, because a baby with a serious diaper rash. I was 
doing all of that--and being underpaid— 
 
26:51.0 
Interviewer: We'll come to that too. What conditions do you face throughout your work 
experience as a domestic worker? What motivated him to say that to you? So that is one 
condition--so you lump that as a form of racism or one of the 'isims'? Technically-- I would say 
the nanny/caregiver/domestic worker is a gem if-- So did you ask a question when it came to 
food, because you're there for how many hours? 12 or 14? So were you relatively new to this 
job and it had to do with cultural nuances as well? You know, you're new, you didn't know what 
to ask for or-- Because your first job you're kind of walking on a tight wire, because you're new-
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027

-new culturally to the people from once you come, you come from Trinidad, these are new 
people, new culture, go ahead-- 
 
Many discrimination. I even had an employer ask me if there was a phone in Trinidad and 
Tobago. Phone, if I knew about phone--telephone. And I looked at him. He was a big attorney 
and I look at him and I said, 'Could you repeat yourself, sir?' I said, 'In this day and age, what do 
you think Trinidad and Tobago is?' I think he was caught in the fantasy of having Verizon as his 
carrier and he was on his phone in his new apartment and he was talking about oh and phone 
and phone, he said, 'By the way, Undine, do you all have telephones in Trinidad and Tobago?' 
And I look at him I was thinking in my mind, 'What an insipid question,' and how as an attorney 
I wasn't expecting such poor grammar and total ignorance. A man who went to Harvard, or 
Harvard I would say, what a lawyer, how could he be so illiterate and literate at the same time?  
 
That is only one condition. It is one of the 'isims' but I would say, they look down on us even--
one famous statement, 'Our child is our prized possession,' so if your child is your prized 
possession and us nannies are taking care of your prized possession, would you not appreciate 
that person highly? Definitely, what I think, and I sum it up in one little sentence in my head. I 
was thinking when he was talking all this tata, like, I was saying to myself, 'He should just sign a 
check. Don't even put in the figures and let me put in the figures of what I'm worth, because I 
don't think there's a price for what I do.'  
 
I'm manager. Manager of the apartment when they're not there, also director because I direct 
workman in and out, Fresh Direct, what have you, nanny, laundry woman, housekeeper, there's 
something needs to be sewed, including his underpants, I'm the seamstress, yes. Yes, 
sometimes even in high society folks, they wear underpants that have little holes and need 
their nanny/seamstress to whip it up. That is only some of the conditions that I have worked 
under. 
 
In some of my jobs as a nanny, there wasn't even food there. Yeah. Their refrigerator--there 
was one night I was wondering if I was in the United States of America or--because the 
refrigerator was empty and here I am with a baby, nothing to eat. I need strength because I'm 
pushing a stroller and I think I deserve at least some little nutrients when the day comes to do 
all these portfolio I'm carrying around. I need something to sustain me. And they weren't poor 
people. Well, at the time I did not know that you're supposed to ask, because I felt utterly 
embarrassed to come up and say, 'And by the way--' because I didn't know, thought it wasn't 
my place to come and ask for some food, so I was hungry to the point where I would open the 
tap and drink the water when the day come. Well, in that instance, that was my first job. And I 
didn't know you could ask, 'Could you all put some food--provide some food for me.' I think for 
me it was like out of place if I asked, because I didn't know better. It was after by talking to 
different people and they say, 'Oh my employer's fridge is stocked and this and that and they 
would bring things for me,' then I got kind of a bit brazen and I asked, 'Could you all provide 
some fruits?' Yes. And after I asked, they asked, 'What do you want? What do you like?' I said, 
'Well, I like tuna and maybe some apples, whatever.' Well I didn't want to ask for too much at a 
time. I didn't want to overdo it, so they would stock up a lot of tuna there until I got tired, but I 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027

didn't want to come out and say no more tuna, just in case they stop so I would have tuna 
everyday until I get tired of the tuna and I started to leave it there and when it accumulated she 
would say, 'Oh, you don't like tuna any more?' I said, 'I can't eat tuna all the time I'm here, I 
need a change I need something different.'  
 
And then I would look forward for the Jewish holidays, because they were Jew and I would look 
forward for those days when they would have bagels and abundance, that's the day when I will 
go in the back and I'm allowed when nobody's watching to take the big chunks of challah bread 
up to today I still like challah from my first experience, because I would take the challah and go 
and squeeze it together and make a ball and eat it. I like challah bread.  
 
 
34:29.1 
interviewer: So what is the best part of your job and give an example. And don't you think that 
they understand, because they will reveal if you were nice to them. As little as they are. 
Because--can I say this?--I remember when I started to work for the three months old baby into 
the four months. He didn't know me from a can of paint, but the way I would sing to him and 
talk to him, when I came through that door his blue eyes were looking for Christine, I could see 
him looking through the door and I said, boy you would reveal if I was hurting you, even at 
three months old.  
 
The best part of my job working as a nanny was seeing the child at the end of the day so happy, 
so healthy; I think that makes my day. At the end of day, it doesn't matter how hard I work 
when I leave and I see that little smile and how that child will hold onto my finger with genuine 
love, because he or she gets to know me and they will hold on there's that little finger they will 
hold onto my hand as if they really appreciate what I was doing for them and seeing the look on 
their face and the smile, that alone was enough. Babies you would know, as they get older you 
will know, because they will not run away from you the will run to you. They would embrace 
you. They would they are very very transparent. That's how I categorize children, very 
transparent, they don't hide. As little as they are they are. Definitely, babies know.  
 
36:49.2 
interviewer: What is the worst part of your job, and give an example. So just let me say this, 
somebody could just say it's a gift, right? I'm just playing god's advocate. --and it's your money-- 
How old was that child? And meanwhile this baby kicks you. What, she was flailing or she was 
just acting up? So let me just back up, this same day that he kicked you is when you went into 
labor? And let me stop you again. The parents knew this? Why? I'm sorry. Was it the impact of 
the kick? Because when these little children flail they hurt you hard. Silence. I call it crying in 
silence. So you didn't heal? So can I say this? Aurora Levins Morales had written a book, I can't 
remember the book, but I read what she said, that our stories are our medicine, as you said 
what you said before, that someone is--you know you always want to write this but here it is. 
Somebody might hear this, yes? Because Johnny has to go to day care or apple picking today, so 
you--

The worst part of my job, I would say, I was doing a job I worked for that family for seven years 
and at the end of the day all they could have given me was a cookbook. And I look at them 
when I was walking away and I said to myself, 'A cookbook.' I have no intention of--number 
one, by then I was not eating meat and all these things so it didn't matter, but I am not a person 
who would stand hours making and experimenting with different things, I am not that person. 
My curiosity is limited when it coming to exploitation with different dishes. Yes, they could say 
it's a gift, but what I'm saying for seven years working without any kind of overtime many days 
standing in for both parents without any--when accident happens--it has developed from one 
child to two children.  
 
I was a baby nurse on the two cases and having accidents happening and having to grab the 
both of them without any money left in the house and rush them to the doctor with blood from 
head to toe in the height of winter and--how could I not. Look at that.  
 
That was an instance in my life when I myself was pregnant and one day I just came from work 
and I was almost due, got home, went into labor, go to the hospital, because that same day the 
older child had just kicked me in my stomach. The child was about two, almost two, and got 
home, go to the hospital, went into labor--and have to go to the hospital--I think he was just 
acting up. I would not blame him, but I went to the hospital. I went into the labor. I still stayed 
and gave him a bath. I never told the parents. I never told the parent. The reason why: I wanted 
to hold onto my job at the time because I had bills to pay and being pregnant I knew I will be 
home for a while after giving birth. So that's why I never said anything, I didn't want them to 
say, 'Oh you accusing my child.' I went into labor. I went to the hospital only to realize that my 
baby's heartbeat wasn't--there was no heartbeat. My baby had died. I had a baby and it was a 
girl.  
 
But I stayed home for a long time and while I was home only for my employer to call me and 
say that she's expecting. And how did I feel at the time? I felt terrible. Honestly, terrible, 
because here I am without my child and then she's calling me on the phone, she knows my 
baby died, at 38 weeks my baby died and here she is, 'Oh we are expecting.' What could I say to 
you? And I am asking myself, 'What should I tell her?' I said, 'That's nice,' but they didn't see the 
tears that were running down my face. It was a loss. My baby could have survived.  
 
I had more questions than answers. I asked the doctors, the doctor said my body was just tired, 
because I was carrying this huge tummy and I'm every day working, riding the subway, going to 
work, carrying that baby and me up and down without a day off, without time to rest, my body 
needed rest, I was overworked, I was doing everything, housework, everything, and I was 
pregnant. What was rather interesting when I look back, I have written a book about this whole 
episode and I said to myself, 'The reason why I haven't published that book yet is because I was 
waiting for the right time, but now I could do it, because it's part of healing, by telling my story. 
It's because I am to a point where I could talk about it without shedding a tear because I know 
inside my heart there is someone out there who is going through similar circumstances and 
who needs for the world to know people are suffering, nannies are suffering, our day workers 
are suffering. It's like slavery all over again but in a hush. It's like you're crying and nobody hears

but god, because on top of everything I came back and here she is asking me to be the baby 
nurse for the baby. I could not stand the smell of Johnson's baby powder, because I have to put 
all my baby's stuff away. I held my baby, as dead as she was, I held her, I love her. Don't they 
think that I was a human? Don't they think I have feelings like everyone else?  
 
And I came back and the first day I came back a few weeks after it wasn't long, like four weeks. 
My whole crotch was hurting me just from walking. Not from anything, just from walking 
because it wasn't, I come back and 'Take it easy Undine,' everything was thrown at me. 
Everything and more. I didn't get a chance. Yes, but you know what I reflect back and I said, and 
I am saying this loud and clear: we need people we need a voice like DWU to stand--we want 
more people to recognize DWU for what they are doing and for them to get the sustenance to 
help our poor brothers and sisters out there who are working under these conditions.  
 
Many of us want to go to the doctor and we cannot get a day off, because what? Our health is 
not important? 'Could you change the doctor appointment?' They always ask that. 'Why can't 
you change the doctor’s appointment?' Come on. We are human. When you cut their skin, the 
color of the blood is the same. My skin, the color of the blood is the same, so why-- I watch over 
the years, nannies, caregivers, collapse. Heart attack, cancer, obesity, all these things and it's all 
because of poor working conditions. Poor working conditions, no time off.  
 
49:05.1 
Interviewer: What are the challenges or sources of tension that you face on the job? So do you 
think that's the tension that you face? I mean the tension is with the parent? Give us something 
succinct, like name something, touch something. It could be redundancy, you know the bag is 
on the table they say the bag is brown, they're still telling you that the bag is brown, you know 
you've been there for one year and the bag is still brown. Because you are invisible, right? They 
don't want it from you. You're not credentialed. Yeah, a dumbing down. 
 
I think working with babies, the challenges is more with their parents than the child. Because 
the parents they ask you some question and you ask yourself--sometime you want to say, but 
you will be fired. You want to say, 'Why don't you go and Google? Go on YouTube and get some 
parenting information and stop asking such stupid questions.' Because the child has that 
genuine love, they don't see color. They don't see race. They're so innocent. They lift their hand 
to us on a daily basis, because they see us as their little protector, the one who takes care of 
them every single day. Routinely. So they raise their little hands when they see us with a big 
pure loving smile to us. Well, do you want an instance? I have many instances when I said that, 
because-- Yes, yes, because they would come to you, I remember working as a nanny with a 
baby nurse background and experience and you know you would say, 'Try this,' the baby is 
having a formula. The baby is colicky and you might give a simple solution and they never take 
your word for it. Or they go to the pediatrician and it's the same thing the pediatrician says--
You're not good enough. Credibility is being questioned. You are just good enough to wipe the 
poop every day and make sure my child's butt is clean, but you're not good enough to analyze if 
your baby has a temperature of 103.4 because we don't know the difference.

Interviewer: How's your relationship with your current employer? Let me ask you, though, I 
hear what you're saying, do you think culture has to do with that? Culture has nothing to do 
with that? You know we'll come back to that, we'll elaborate on that, but your relationship with 
your employer is you're watching, is that safe to say? You're looking? And it's been said that 
you can never know somebody.  
 
I would say I watch everything--I'm very aware of every little detail and I don't underestimate 
their--they seem to be nice, I would put it nicely like that. They seem to be genuine, but I don't 
feel it, they seem to be nice, I don't see it, because I'm always second guessing. Everything they 
do it's like there's a motive and so because of that I always look at my present employers--it will 
take a while, it will probably take years. No. Nothing. It's from experience.  
 
I see many Fridays in this industry. Employers come home and they say they don't need you no 
more. Many Fridays, and many nannies have to go home to their family without any kind of 
benefits, without knowing what the next meal or money coming from to buy clothes for their 
kids. Don't they think that we have family? This is a real job. Don't they think that we have 
needs? Don't they think that we have responsibility? Would you not kindly give me some 
notice? Like two weeks notice and say, 'You know on the 21st, this is the beginning of January 
and at the end of January, we don't think we need you enough. Please start to look for a job.' 
They don't. And there is nothing in Congress or wherever there is nothing in writing that we 
need to say if a nanny works 'x' amount of years this is what she or he is entitled to. There is 
nothing there in black and white for us.  
 
We are not only--I'm at my present job almost a year and sometimes I see a little fang for lack 
of a better explanation you might see a tiny hint of a different side. There's a mask. And then 
from time to time you see the mask might slide a little bit and then it comes back down. So for 
now, until I get to know who they are, because they're saying who they are is different and 
working with them, it only takes time. You can never know, you can be around them and never 
know because there's a mask. They never reveal their true self. 
 
56:45.3 
Interviewer: Are there relationships with your previous children who you have cared for that 
are particularly memorable in a good or a bad kind of way? Any of the kids in your industry that 
you've worked with--He made a discovery? Wow. And kids don't have a semblance of-- 
Somebody tell him something and the next day it comes he pinpointed it out. Yesterday he 
played with the kids, right? And this morning--And kids don't see--And that kind of stays with 
you. You want to give a good one? I mean this is good too, but do you want to give a feel-good 
one? Did they acknowledge that, though? Didn't even say thank you. You just do your job and 
you move on. 
 
I look back with a lot of fond memories and it was a privilege watching these children grow and 
develop. I had one instance where I had a little boy and he used to play with all the little kids 
and one day while playing he would play all with little black boys in the park and he would have 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
11
the best time playing basketball what have you because he was small but he knew everything 
and had his own ball and then I don't know if he had told his parents and one day when he's 
talking to me he is like, 'You're brown.' And he had never said that before. He made a discovery 
overnight after--because I said, 'Who told you that?' and he said his dad.  
 
So then with that discussion dad told him the difference between his shade you know the shade 
he has to my shade, so he discovered overnight so next day he could differentiate what color. 
And I was looking all the weeks gone by and he was playing with all these black children in the 
park and he'd never one day said, 'They're that color and I'm that color.' And I probably looked 
at him and said, 'Wow.' Overnight he could have known the different shades. Because children 
don't lie. Yesterday, and he knows different colors. They're colorblind when it's you and friends. 
It's the adults on the minds of the children. That stayed in my mind. And many other instances, 
it stayed on my mind.  
 
Many, yes, I remember one time with a baby and I watched her from the day she was born. She 
spent the first three months she was so tiny no one wanted to hold her and the doctor said to 
her mom she has to gain weight rapidly and in order for her to gain weight I have to spend the 
first three months with her on my boobs thank god at that time I had boobs, so I would put her 
here to sleep in my chest and here I am in a rocking chair every day and she did gain the weight 
nicely and I look back at her now, she's a big girl going to one of the most prestigious schools in 
New York City and doing very well and I was happy to be part of that. I don't think so; I don't 
think they remember all [unclear.] No. I do my job. At the end of the day now, I don't look for 
anything. At the Christmas if I don't get a present, I don't get a bonus, I don't miss it, because I 
don't live in preparation of expecting a bonus.  
 
1:01:11 
Interviewer: Do you feel the amount of hours you work and your holiday schedule are being 
respected?  
 
I would say I work ten hours per day. I think it's too much. It's a long day, because when I get in 
there at 8 the baby is my full responsibility until 6:00 and it's a lot. Childcare, if nobody knows 
the kind of job childcare entails until you work doing childcare, then you're going to realize how 
difficult that job is. Working as a nanny as a caregiver, it's very very difficult. It's too long, ten 
hours is too much, but vacation is okay. I got list of vacation for the year, I'm somewhat 
satisfied. The only thing that stands out--I had last year asked for Martin Luther holiday that 
was a holiday I asked, 'Why am I not getting it?' and I don't see it on 2016 holiday as a vacation 
day. So I guess it's not respected. 
 
1:02:46 
Interviewer: Would you say you or any worker that you know has been exploited due to 
immigration status? 
 
Yes. Yes. I have seen many cases where people, because of their status are being victimized, are 
being over worked and underpaid. I had a friend she was undocumented, working as a nanny 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
12
and long hours. She came down with breast cancer and unfortunately passed and left her only 
child to survive by herself and on her dying bed I was talking to her and one of the things stuck 
out in my mind was that if she had to do it all over again she would do it differently, because 
many times before she was diagnosed and she was complaining that she had a cough and her 
breast was hurting and all of these things, she could not get the time off to go to the doctor as 
she would have liked and because of that, by the time she got to the doctor it was already stage 
four. So her dying words was that 'if I had gotten the time that I had asked and not been 
postponed over and over, I probably would have been able to save my life.' 
 
1:04:32 
Interviewer: So do you ever share cultural things from your heritage with the family you assist? 
For example, food, language-- 
 
The only thing I share with the family that I'm working presently with is when I travel I talk 
about the mangos, organic--true organic. That is true organic, not the GMO not the modified 
food that is here with all the chemicals and the fertilizers and pesticides that people are eating. 
Go to the Caribbean go to different countries and sit under the mango tree and get the fruit as 
it falls from the tree. [unclear.] You sit there and you eat that and you enjoy it, then you know 
what is the beauty of organic. That is the definition of organic.  
 
1:05:32 
Interviewer: So do you currently have children of your own of family or individual 
responsibilities that you are taking care of? Here or there? Here and there as in where? So how 
do you manage to balance your personal life and your work life? How do you do that? Hare 
Krishna-- 
 
I do. All of the above. Here and there. In Trinidad and Tobago and the United States of America. 
I would only say a few words on that: by god's grace. It's only god, so for whoever--it's faith--for 
whoever is Christian will understand where I am coming from. They will understand the power 
of faith and who are Muslim they are going to understand in their own way for different 
denominations they're going to understand where I'm coming from. It's only god, no matter 
who you call him, whether Muhammad, whether you call him Allah--[unclear.] it's only one god 
and it's only because of him I'm here.  
 
1:06:49 
Interviewer: How does being a domestic worker impact your own family life? How does that 
really happen? And it does. So in saying that, if your family is here and you have to work it 
impacts your family, though, because you're working ten hours as you said before, you're 
barely able-- And hope that they swing how they swing? 
 
It does, because that's how I maintain--that's how I take care of my parents, my family. That's 
what's sustaining me. Yes --see them. By the time I get home I'm exhausted. I can't go 
anywhere I can't go nowhere, I can't take them nowhere, I just have to lie down and sleep I 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027

guess, now and then take a shower. I write directions: this is how you get there, this is how you 
go there. Socializing is out of the question. 
1:07:42 
Interviewer: Are you a member of other groups? 
Many groups. Including my church. 
1:07:52 
Interviewer: And when you are doing domestic work have you felt supported or have you felt 
like you're working in an isolated environment? What are your feelings? But when you started 
originally--But felt supported by who, though? 
When I'm doing my domestic work I feel empowered, because--I don't feel isolated--when I 
came from Trinidad and Tobago and I didn't know better, I felt like if I was saying to myself, 
'Don't people know that slavery still exists?' That was what I was thinking to myself, because of 
the way I felt the way I was treated, but then after as time goes on and I get to know people in 
other organizations I felt empowered and supported. By different groups, DWU was one of 
them. 
1:09:05 
Interviewer: When and why did you become a part of DWU and how did you hear about it? 
I became part of DWU I would say for as long as maybe close to 15 years that I've been a part of 
this movement and it has been--I heard about it, I think I was in the park and one lady was 
coming around and asking about workers, do we know our worker's rights and things like that. I 
remember quite vividly. A little Asian woman came and she was talking and I listened and I said, 
'Wow, she gave me the paper and that's how I went to a meeting. I became a member 
sometime later on I met members women very strong minded who were willing to go out there 
and fight for us and I said, 'If they can go out, why can't I?' So I started to go to the different 
meetings.  
1:10:12 
Interviewer: What has it meant for you and your work that the Domestic Workers Bill of Rights 
was passed in 2010. So you think the Bill of Rights has made that possible? 
A lot. A lot, because I could tell other people what that Bill of Rights means, not only to nannies 
and caregivers but even the workers who are working in places like McDonalds and other 
corporations. It impacts each and every one of us. I recently went to see a client and the client 
had a Spanish woman doing housekeeping for her, a young woman and she was going--she was 
presently away, this is me, this is April and she is presently away and she wanted to get 
someone because the woman is pregnant, going off on maternity, and I was telling her how 
much they should appreciate whoever is coming and pay them at least give them something to 
go home to so they could afford to feed and take care of their family and I tell her, 'Do you 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
14
know that right now there are different amendment to the labor laws and what workers are 
entitled to?' and I said, 'How much do you pay this lady?' '$12' and I said,' Really?' And she's 
pregnant, a young woman, but apparently she had been there for a while. She turn and tell her, 
I was listening to the news a while back and thanks to Undine here you will now be getting $15 
an hour, so $3 more per hour. I would say kudus, it did make a difference.  
On that day she went from $12 to $15. Why? Because she's from Mexico and she doesn't speak 
English properly and she's undocumented. Definitely yes, and we need to see more 
amendments and more being done not only in New York, but all throughout the different states 
for the people who goes to peoples' house and clean and cook and do all the--even the 
gardeners--everyone these. It will always have different categories of workers, but these 
workers need to get what they deserve, this is hard work. 
1:13:16 
Interviewer: So on that note, what would you like to see happen in the future with the Bill of 
Rights? And I touched the tip of it. 
Yes, I want to see more implementation. You could see more new things being added to it, yes, 
additions. 
1:13:47 
Interviewer: So from your perspective, why is Domestic Workers United important for domestic 
workers? And it's also important knowing your rights, I mean empowerment, right? I mean, a 
group of women leading a movement to change. 
It is important that people know this body this group of people who are willing to go out there 
and educate them on their rights because a lot of people are living in ignorance. They don't 
know their rights they go out and I know they have to support their family so they're grabbing 
and they're taking whatever comes their way, but at the end of the day they should be equally 
paid for what they do which is a true member's job.  
1:14:48 
Interviewer: And it's also important you're right knowing your rights, I mean empowerment, 
right? I mean a group of women leading a movement. A change, yeah? What would you want 
your legislators to know? What would you say to them? 
If I was talking to them face-to-face I would look them in their eyes and I would tell them my 
story, I would tell them about my struggle to support my parents. I am the mother of seven 
kids. To support my children to put them through secondary school. I want them to see we are 
the women who go out there not with the fancy nails--we can't afford that--but we go out there 
every day and make a difference in other people's homes. We have keys for your homes and we 
are not being paid properly. We are not being paid--and I heard Mr. Bernie, but he gave a 
statement recently where he said, 'Anyone working for 50 hours per week should not be living 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
15
paycheck to paycheck.' And we are working 50 hours and more per week and yet at the end of 
the week it goes right back, because it's just a little bit, it's not enough. 
So Mr. Legislators out there, all the people who make the rules and the laws of this great 
country of ours, United States of America, I, Undine, born and bred in Trinidad but I'm 
American, I want to tell you all, look down on us. We are New York City here and we are going 
out there and we're working many hours, nights, days, whatever it takes to support our family, 
but we need the help we need laws we need bills passed so that we could take care of our 
family. One country. One nation. 
1:16:56 
Interviewer: So are you happy with the bill's impact? And you kind of said it just now. Are you 
happy with the bill's impact? Why do you think that is, though? Because--and let me stop you--
in 2010 Domestic Workers United was so in vogue over every tabloid, right? And why are you 
still unhappy with the impact? Different reach. So is it safe to say that you're happy with the 
Bill's impact or not? 
I am happy to a point, but a lot of people need to be educated, a lot of people don't know it 
exists. Because-- We need some more, I would say, exposure. More meetings different places, 
different--And not only that, we need support financially and otherwise. The different venues 
and it takes money for transportation and all of this. I'm happy to a point, with a few more 
amendments to it it's going to be tremendous, yes.  
1:18:21 
Interviewer: What area of education/skills are you looking to gain? Nothing is wrong with that. 
To gain?  
Well, that is a very interesting topic. I look at myself. In my 20s I wanted to be 30s, because 
when people asked me my age and I was 20 I would say, 'hmm, close to 30,' in my 30s I wanted 
to be 40, in my 40s I wanted to be 50, now that I'm in my 50s, I want to be 20. Because here I 
am doing my degree at this age and looking to go on to do my bachelor's of science in the same 
at this age. So I'm just motivating and encouraging someone out there.  
It's never too late. From the cleaning of the kitchen, from the scrubbing of the floor for $10 an 
hour or maybe 8, here I am. Or 7 or 6, and here I am 2016 going on, going to college, going on 
for my degree, looking forward for my bachelor's of science in nursing and I had never said 
never, maybe my PhD one day, so that's how my education street is running for lack of better 
words. I'm doing all these fancy things from a college, microbiology, things I never dreamt I 
would be doing after having seven kids and grandchildren. Nothing is impossible. 
1:20:11 
Interviewer: What skills did DWU teach you and what type of training? 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
16
I learned quite a lot, because I was there from the very beginning and I learned how to stand up 
and speak up even if you're nervous, still speak. Someone is going to listen. It might take a 
while, but someone is going to hear, someone is going to get the message. 
1:20:43 
Interviewer: How is cultural expression used as a tool for outreach and advocacy in Domestic 
Workers United? Well, storytelling, how important that is culturally to movement building? 
Because if you may, somebody's story that made the movement. Somebody spoke that story 
that was able, somebody said, 'wow' and most movements are built on someone's story. 
Stories that make movements. So it's used as a form of advocacy and in advocacy work. 
Speaking that truth to power. 
I think when a lot of people come together and bring their differences--from different countries 
and merge and make it a combination it can be an interesting form of togetherness. I don't 
know if that answers your question. Yeah, because everyone has a different cultural--or story 
background and when one shares their story with another it might be in two different places, 
but there are a lot of similarities. So it's a merger of the whole global-cultural effect. Yes. 
1:22:23 
Interviewer: So do you have any last words or parting shots you would like to share? Anything 
you would like to just say? 
In closing, or concluding, I would say that thanks, thanks first and foremost to god and for the 
innovative personnel and persons of DWU, Domestic Workers United, for educating me in some 
of the basic when I didn't have a clue of what my right was working in the environment, 
working in someone else's home and being taken advantage of and I got it was an eye-opener 
when I first got involved with Domestic Workers United, they opened my eyes.  
I remember going to different symposium and there were editors and writers from all over the 
world and getting to tell my story and people were actually listening and they were coming up 
and they wanted to know you know what happened, what goes on, because some of us work 
for some of the richest people in America, in New York City and these are the people who 
would want us to be [hushing sound.] I remember working for one man and he was a big man in 
Lehman Brother's and Lehman Brother's went down. I actually saw him, the tears running out 
of his eyes and that's a day when I walk into his house and his two little children were standing 
on a little stool in the refrigerator helping themselves to some frozen waffles in order to make 
breakfast for themselves and I was watching the news. He didn't have to say a word because he 
never discussed it with me, I'm just a nanny, I'm just uneducated and black, I don't have any 
sense I don't look at the news I'm too tired and I look at him and when Lehman Brothers went 
down, I said to myself, 'Where did the money go?' Because these are the people that I look 
back 2016 now and they live on Upper West End, East End, from West End to East End and they 
are millionaires. Where did all this money disperse away and go? And they can't even pay their 
nanny a decent living wage. That's my final words.
