THAT WHICH ENDURES
 (rewite from transcription of 11/11/95
 
speech)
 
What  is  "that which endures"?
 Naturally I have been thinking
 
about this  for the last  few days,  for we have been in an
 
awfully complicated meeting with a lot of ideas floating
 
around and a lot of interesting problems that  I never even
 
thought about before,  frankly.  So I don't have any real final
 
ideas,  just a few notions to float out here along with a
 
bunch of little  stories,  vignettes  from my experience,  with a
 
few words  in between to try to explain what  I got out of
 
them.  And maybe  some of the  sum of it will make a kind of
 
sense.  And I thought  I would start with a story that my
 
father liked to tell.
 
My father was born in  1867,  and he used to say this story was
 
probably pretty old when he  learned it.  It was about an old
 
country fellow who came home from church one morning,  and
 
told his wife about the new preacher in town,  and his report
 
went:  "Well,  this new fellow,  he  spoke the unspeakable and
 
he  said the unsayable, and he unscrewed the  inscrutable.  But
 
you know what,  Martha,  he never did say wherein."
 
And during this  conference we have been saying the unsayable,
 
speaking the unspeakable and yesterday,  in that marvellous
 
media session,  we did some unscrewing of the  inscrutable,  but
 
we haven't really been talking about the wherein -
-
 which is,
 
of course,  art.
 
Now this  is very characteristic of conferences  in general,
 
and I think the planners of this particular conference are to
 
be complimented on the fact that there has  so far been any
 
mention at all of the  subject that brings us all here. When  I
 
used to work for the Endowment,  I went to meeting after
 
meeting in which the topic was art,  but art was rarely part
 
of the conversation and frequently never came up at all on
 
the  floor or in the  speeches.  This  is because,  you see,
 
Americans are such great technicians.  We love to think about
 
how to do it,  no matter what  "it" is.  (
I now must edit
 
myself.  What  I had intended to say was that Americans of
 
European backgrounds are marvellous technicians and such
 
folks tend to talk excessively about how to do things and
 
relatively little about what they are doing)
 
Artists,  on the other hand,  are not  "how" people,  they are
 
"what" people and they
 are out doing the "what" as hard as
 
they can go.  In fact,  I believe that  is why we have artists
 
around,  and why they are such awkward people to deal with so
 
much of the time.  They are doing things without consideration
 
of "how" except  in terms of their own individual  "how"
 
problems,  which of course they have to take up themselves.
 
Essentially they are  focussed on  "what"
 
So that  is/ "what" we are dealing with.  That  is what  is
 
enduring -
7
"
- art and trouble.  Those are the two things  I
 
thought
 
o  right away when  I saw this title -
-
 ar t an d
 
trouble. /Nothing stops them.  We change them,  we fool with
 
them,  we make different ways  for them to evidence themselves,
 
but they are constant  in the human experience.
 
When I was  in my teens,  I was going to college in
 
Philadelphia and I used to come down to see my folks in
 
Washington D.C.  every couple of months.
 One time  I came and
 
the WPA -
-
 the whole Works Progress Adminiustration wasn 't
 
there.  It was a big place;  it employed lots of people,  and it
 
was gone!  The desks,  the chairs,  the telephones,  the electric
 
fans,  the  file cabinets.
 They were  just gone.  They still
 
turn up every once in a while in Washington in someone's
 
garage or cellar;  a little piece of the WPA washes to the
 
surface and gets put  into an archive.
 
But the entity was gone.  It was a real  shock.  I didn't  know
 
things disappeared like that.  Years  later when I got a job at
 
the BNational Endowment  for the Arts,  the very first day I
 
walked into what was to be the Folk Arts Program  (it was  just
 
an empty little room with a desk and a stenographer's chair
 
that had about  a five  foot high pile of correspondence)  I
 
asked "What am I supposed to do?" And they said, "Take care of
 
that." And I sat down and thought to myself,  "Bess,  you ' d
 
better work fast.
 You; d better think what y ou want to do
 
and get on with it,  girl,  because this place is going to
 
explode on you too one of these days.  One of these days,  you
 
are going to come to work and it  is not going to be here."
 
Thinking that way right  from the very first day informed
 
everything I did
 
w th a sense of..
.±you only have this chance
 
for a little while  .
 So,  if it doesn't work that way,  let's
 
try it this way.  Let's work as  flexibly and as steadily and
 
as purposefully as we possibly can and try to get as much
 
done as possible because this whole place is  liable to blow
 
up one of these days.  Everything does.  There  isn't anything
 
constant but art and trouble.
 
There is a folklorist who wrote a very interesting paper in
 
which he pointed out that amongst the people  in the United
 
States who communicate basically in English,  there are two
 
different  clusters of traditional tales that center around
 
two different main characters.  He thought both the characters
 
and the stories  represent two different ways Americans  like
 
to think of getting things done.
 
One of those characters  is Paul Bunyan and,  like John Henry
 
in some ways,  he got things done by virtue of power and
 
muscle,  size and energy.  He made the Great Lakes by stomping
 
a bug that was biting him and he made the rivers  flow
 
backwards and he blew the  forests down.  He was the epitome of
 
raw power.  The other group of stories have to do with Brer
 
Rabbit and also,  by the way,  the Jack and the Beanstalk
 
fellow about whom similar stories are told.  They are the same
 
kind of leading character because they are not very big,  in
 
fact they are small and get things done by virtue of being
 
witty,  cunning,  fast moving and able to change directions
 
very quickly but  still keep going for what they want.
 
So when I began at the Endowment,  another thing that came to
 
my mind was that paper,  and it was plain to see that  I wasn't
 
one of the Paul Bunyan kind.  I had less than $50,000  for my
 
first years budget and that knocked me right out of the Paul
 
Bunyan class.  So I was going to have to be a Brer Rabbit.
 
At this conference  I have  looked around this  room and heard
 
different people talk and spotted some Paul Bunyans and some
 
Brer Rabbits and I suspect that the Foundation world is a
 
compound of groups that are using these two different
 
strategies,  Both of them are,  of course,  very good in terms
 
of getting things done.  I do not claim one is better than the
 
other. Which strategy you use has to do with the relative size
 
you are and the relative gifts you have to offer and what
 
kinds of power you can bring to whatever your particular
 
problems are.
 
But to return briefly to the WPA situation,  after it  fell,  I
 
noticed it was gone and I am sure a lot of other people
 
noticed it was gone too.  But the sun came up the next morning
 
and the moon rose that night,  and things wen't on happening.
 
Art didn't  stop and trouble didn't  stop;  they just got
 
organized differently,  especially in that the art occurred in
 
different places  so that  it was  seen or heard by different
 
people.  This made for changes
 
Maybe those changes would have occurred if the WPA had stayed
 
alive,  I don't know.  But  I do know that,  as Bella Lewitzsky
 
pointed out  so vividly in her talk,  the enormous black hole
 
that was  left by the disappearance of the WPA was very
 
quickly occupied by a number of forces that had helped
 
engineer its collapse,  because government doesn't  stand for
 
vacancies.  I was concerned to sense a number of people here
 
thinking the Endowment  is now effectively out of the picture
 
so we will have to manage by working out various  coalitions
 
of smaller groups.
 That  is a good Brer Rabbit strategy,  but
 
I would point out that  it will operate  in opposition to some
 
Paul Bunyans,  politically speaking,  who are preparing to move
 
into the vacancies that will occur should the Endowment
 
collapse.
 
One of the things  I believe needs to happen is that the
 
conversation should stop centering so much on the Arts
 
Endowment and turn to discussing what  is important about
 
federal participation in the arts anyway?
 What would be the
 
ideal way of organizing federal activity? Shall we recommend
 
re-creating the Endowment  in gentler times? Or what? We need
 
to have some ideas.  Otherwise we may well be left with a
 
black hole that will be very very difficult to defend.
 
Now if you notice,  I have with the best of intentions been
 
talking almost exclusively about the "hows"  instead of the
 
"whats".  I can't help it;  it  just bubbles out of me.  I am a
 
standard European American and I love technology;  I love to
 
think about how to do things.  I have been telling you a
 
little bit about how to be a Brer Rabbit and how to be a Paul
 
Bunyan and I haven't told you about what at all.  But now let
 
me propose a "how" that we can actually turn into a "what"  if
 
we  just go and do it.
 
I think we must  say that,  in the world of the arts,  it  is
 
time to stop talking about multiculturalism and be
  
multicultural.  We go on and on and on discussing it and we
 
don't  "be"  it primarily because  it  is  such hard work.  It
 
really is.  Being multi-cultural  is very difficult not because
 
of a lack of good intentions but because it  is hard to
 
understand other peoples) and other peoples have a hard time
 
understanding us.
 
My brother in law was  in the Merchant Marine during World
 
Watr II,  and he got  stuck waiting for a shipment  in a bleak
 
port  in North Africa,  really just a bunch of sheds,  not a
 
cafe,  not a store,  nothing.  So he made  friends with a little
 
Arab boy,  a son of a local  laborer.  The child spoke a couple
 
of English words and Pete  learned a couple of Arabic words
 
and they played finger games and drew things  in the sand,
 
amusing each other and trying to be friends.
 
One day the little boy said,  "I write English".  Pete said,
 
"Oh,  wow,  can you?  I' ll get you a piece of paper and you show
 
me." So he got out  some paper and a pencil and the little boy
 
made four staggering capitals,  writing right to left -
-
 P,  I.
 
H.  S.  It  spelled SHIP when you looked at it.  There it was!
 
SHIP!  The  little boy had copied it  from the sides of the
 
anchored freighters,  and he did it  just  fine.  He was making a
 
good solid Arab try at a cross-cultural experience,  using all
 
the  skills he knew  (working harder than Pete was at the time,
 
actually.)
 
And he was right -
-
 he could spell SHIP.  But because he was
 
going from right to left  instead of left to right,  he
 
couldn't build on what he thought he knew -
-
 he couldn't
 
spell PUSH for instance.  But he was working so hard.
 
That  SHIP  comes  into my mind all the time when I am talking
 
with people from other cultures,  because  I always need to
 
remind myself deep inside that things  I think I understand
 
could be backwards.  I could be operating  just the wrong way
 
around,  and so could the people who are trying so hard to get
 
together with me.
 
Now,  my dear friends,  when you really understand that,  when
 
you get that  into your heads permanently,  you are going to
 
drop this terrible metaphor we use -
-
 the model of the
 
grantor and the  supplicant,  the  lord and the peasant who is
 
coming in to get  funding.  You are not going to think that way
 
any more. You are going to realize instead that you are
 
working with people conjointly on a problem connected with
 
art  into which vou can put  in some money,  perhaps,  but,  they 
have to put  in some things too.  It  is a reciprocal
 
relationship you have  set up there,  and I urge you to try it,
 
to use  it as a model.
 
I was thinking yesterday that at this meeting we are actually
 
talking about philanthropy.  We are working within this
 
culture's philanthropic system and suddenly it hit me that we
 
are only talking in terms of our own;  we don't talk about
 
anybody else's  system of philanthropy,  do we?
 
Hear 
eoples other than western Europeans take care of their
 
educational systems and their health systems and their arts
 
too,  and so they have developed ways of doing all that.  But
 
we rarely think to bring other ways  into the discussion.  I
 
know,  just  from visiting a little bit,  that most American
 
Indian tribes,  for example,  have a philanthropic system that
 
is very reciprocal.  They have potlatches and giveaways and,
 
when you give somebody something,  they are obligated to give
 
something back.  Now that puts a different  spin on how we
 
should be giving money in the  Indian world,  doesn't  it? Maybe
 
we are putting burdens on people.  Maybe they want or need to
 
accept those burdens,  but maybe the discussion of the
 
transaction ought to be different,  which is what  I am
 
suggesting here.
 
h
 
work better
 
Whether you are a Paul Bunyan or a Brer Rabbit,  I would like
 
to see you to take on a problem or two,  not  just an
 
institution.  One of the strongest advantages of the old Folk
 
and Traditional Arts Program was that our field was  so
 
underinstitutionalized we didn't have to spend most of our
 
energy working with institutional complexities.  Most of you
 
are  stuck with them,  but you can begin to reduce their size a
 
bit.

Try thinking in terms of problems for a change.  How about
 
doing something to try to take care of the very real needs of
 
the performing arts? They need rehearsal spaces,  they need
 
publicity materials,  they need all kinds of things right
 
across the board from New York to California.  And visual
 
artists need marketing knowhow and supplies.  How about  some
 
kind of a cheap warehouse where people could buy not-for-
profit-priced photographic materials,  or clay,  paint and
 
canvas?
 
There was once an old blind lady named Emma Dusenberry.  She
 
lived in Mena,  Arkansas and she was born blind and she sang.
 
B  the time any folklorist  found her,  she knew hundreds and
 
h undreds of songs all the way through.  She  sat there with
 
her blind eyes  looking out at whatever she saw in her head,
 
and she was  just a river of song.  One time  somebody asked her
 
how she came to know so many songs,  and she  said,  "Well,  you
 
know when  I was a little girl  I decided I was going to learn
 
every song in the world.  Every single one.  And so every song
 
I heard,  I learned it,  and I learned and I learned and that
 
is how I know these  songs." The  folklorist  said to her,
 
"Well,  Mrs.  Dusenberry,  did you succeed in learning all the
 
songs  in the world? Did you ever get there?" She  said,  "No,  I
 
had to quit.  They kept on making up new ones."
 
I think that  is the beauty of the work we are involved in.
 
The artists and the troubles are out there enduring,  and they
 
keep on making up new ones  for us,  so we'll always have
 
something exciting to do and to get together about and to
 
join hands on and to have a wonderful time with.  So finish up
 
your meeting in great  spirits,  go home,  add just maybe one
 
what to your hows and maybe one problem to your institutional
 
list and remember what you' ve learned these  last three days.
 
And if you ever want to talk about  it all,  just call me on
 
the telephone.

THAT WHICH ENDURES
 
Speaker:
 Bess Lomax Hawes
 
Well, naturally I have been thinking about this.
 It has been
 
an awfully complicated meeting with an awful lot of ideas floating
 
around,  an  awful  lot  of  interesting  problems  that  I never  even
 
thought about before came up,  and what to say about "What Is That
 
Which Will Endure?".
 I finally decided to string together a bunch
 
of short little stories,  little vignettes from my experience, with
 
a few words in between to try to explain what I got out of them in
 
the hopes that maybe some of this will make sense.
 I don't know.
 
Because, like everybody else, I don't have any final ideas.
. . I just
 
have a few things to float out here and I thought  I would start
 
with a story that my father liked to tell.
 
He was born in 1867 and he used to say this story was probably
 
pretty old when he learned it.
 It was about a country fellow that
 
came home from church one morning and he told his wife about the
 
new preacher in town and he said,  "You know this man, he spoke the
 
unspeakable.  He said the unsayable .. .he unscrewed the inscrutable.
 
But you know what, Martha?
 He never did tell us we
e in."
 
I kind of thought about that with this conference.
 You know,
 
we have been saying the unsayable,  speaking the unspeakable,  and
 
yesterday in that marvelous media event, we did some unscrewing of
 
the inscrutable,  but we haven't been talking about the wherein.
 
Now this is very characteristic,  by the way,  of conferences and I
 
think  the  planners  of  this  conference  are  to  be  enormously
 
complimented on the fact that there has been any mention at all of
 
art.
 When  I used to work  for the  Endowment,  I went  to meeting
 
after meeting, national meetings,  in which the topic was art and it
 
-1-
was never part of the conversation.. . never came up at all,  on the
 
floor or in the speeches.
 Because, you see,  I think Americans are
 
technicians.
 That was one of the things that came up at various
 
times.  We love to think about "how" to do it.
 We are very good at
 
it.
 Now,  I should immediately go back and edit myself.
 What I
 
intended to say there was that Americans of European background are
 
marvelous technicians.
 That's what we like to think about and I
 
notice  in my own self,  although I keep on trying to stay on the
 
point,  I constantly  get  off  into  "hows".
 Americans,  European
 
Americans in particular,  talk excessively about how to do things
 
and very little about what they are doing.
 In fact,  it sometimes
 
doesn't occur to them to think of it at all, I think.
 Artists, on
 
the other hand,  are "what" people. .  . they are not how people.
 They
 
are out doing the what.
 In fact,  I think that is why we have them
 
around and why they are such awkward people to deal with an awful
 
lot of the time.
 They are doing things without consideration of
 
how, except in terms of their own internal "how" problems, which of
 
course  they  have  to  take  up  themselves.
 Essentially  they  are
 
t2
'\'C tS
 
focused on "hew &.
 So that is what we are dealing with here.
 That
 
is what is enduring.
 Art and trouble.
 Those are the two things I
 
thought
 of
 right
 away  when
 I  saw
 this
 title.
 Art
 and
 
trouble. .  . those are what endure.
 Nothing stops them.
 We change
 
them,  we  fool  with  them,  we  make  different  ways  for  them  to
 
evidence themselves, but they are constant in the human experience.
 
When I was in my teens, I was going to college in Philadelphia
 
and I used to come down to see my father and my brother about every
 
couple of months in Washington.  One time I came and the WPA wasn't
 
there.
 I mean it was gone!
 It was a big place.
.
.  it had lots of
 
people.
 I mean,
 it  was  gone!
 The  desks,  the  chairs,  the
 
telephones,  the electric fans,  the file cabinets.
 They were just
 
gone.
 They still turn up every once  in awhile  in Washington  in
 
somebody's garage or cellar .
... there is a little piece of the WPA
 
that washes to the surface and gets put into an archive.
 But,  it
 
was gone.
 It was a real  shock.
 I didn't know things went  like
 
-2-
that.
 I didn't know things just disappeared.
 Years later when I
 
got a job at the National Endowment for the Arts in connection with
 
the Folk Arts program,  the very first day that  I walked  in that
 
office  (it was just an empty little room and it had a desk and a
 
little  stenographer's  chair  that  had  about  a 5'  high  pile  of
 
correspondence), I said, "What am I supposed to do?" and they said,
 
"Take care of that."
 I sat down and thought to myself,  "Bess, you
 
better work pretty fast.
 You better think what you want to do and
 
get on with it girl,  because this place is going to explode on you
 
one of these days.
 One of these days you are going to come to work
 
and it  is not going to be here."
 I thought that right from the
 
beginning and  it  informed everything I did with a sense of  'you
 
only have this chance for awhile', so gosh, if it doesn't work this
 
way,  let's try that way.
 If it doesn't work that way,  let's go on
 
this way because you are not going to go by here again.. . you are
 
not going to get another chance at this.
 Let's go as flexibly and
 
as steadily and as purposefully as we possibly can and see how much
 
we can get done before this whole place is liable to blow up one of
 
these days. Everything does.  There isn't anything constant but art
 
and trouble.
 
Now, there is a folklorist who wrote a very interesting paper
 
in which he pointed out that amongst the people in United States
 
who communicate basically in English, there are two different kinds
 
of story groups.
.
. about two different characters.
 He thought they
 
represented  two  different  ways  that  Americans  like  to  think  of
 
getting things done.
 One of those characters is Paul Bunyan with
 
whom John Henry is in certain ways connected. .  . not all ways by any
 
means,  but  Paul  Bunyan  got  things  done  by  virtue  of  power  and
 
muscle and size and energy.
 You know,  he made the great lakes by
 
stomping  a bug  that was  biting him  and he made the  rivers  flow
 
backwards and he blew the forests down.
 He was the epitome of raw
 
power.
 The other group of tales have to do with Brer Rabbit and
 
also, by the way, that Jack the Beanstalk fella about whom a lot of
 
other  stories  are  told.
 They  are  very  much  the  same  kind  of
 
-3-
character because they are not very big.
 In fact, they are kind of
 
small.  They are always portrayed as small people.  They get things
 
done by virtue of being witty and cunning and thoughtful and very
 
fast moving and being able to change directions very quickly,  but
 
still  go  for  what  they  want.
 So,  when  I started  at  the  Arts
 
Endowment, another thing I thought about was that paper and I knew
 
darn well I wasn't one of the Paul Bunyan kind.
 I only had $50,000
 
for my first budget for the year.
 That kind of knocked me out of
 
the Paul Bunyan level.
 So, I was going to be Brer Rabbit.  At this
 
conference,  I have  looked  around  this  room  and  heard  different
 
people talk and I spotted some Paul Bunyan's  and I have spotted
 
some  Brer Rabbits  and  I suspect  that  the  Foundation world  is  a
 
compound of groups that are using these two different strategies.
 
They are both very good,  by the way,  in terms of getting things
 
done.
 I am not saying one is any better than the other.
 It has to
 
do with the relative size you are and the relative gifts you have
 
and what kinds of power you can bring to whatever your particular
 
problems are.  Now,  I want to stop off and put in just a postscript
 
about the WPA.
 You see,  after the WPA fell,  after it wasn't there
 
anymore,  I noticed  it was  gone.
 I think  a lot  of  other people
 
noticed it was gone.
 But the sun came up the next morning and the
 
moon rose that night and things went on.
 Art didn't stop, trouble
 
didn't stop.
 It just got organized very differently and I have to
 
say that the  art happened  in different places.
 It was  seen  or
 
heard by different people.
 And it also,  to a degree,  was changed
 
and maybe those changes would have happened if the WPA had stayed
 
on;
 I don't know.
 But I do know that as our dear friend,  Bella
 
Louwitzke pointed out to us so vividly last night,  that that hole
 
that was left,  that black hole that was left by the disappearance
 
of the WPA, was very quickly occupied by a number of people who had
 
engineered  its  collapse,  because  government  doesn't  stand  for
 
vacancies.
 I was very concerned to hear what seemed to me a number
 
of people saying that the Endowment is going to be gone and so then
 
we will manage by working out various coalitions of smaller groups.
 
Now that is a good Brer Rabbit strategy,  but I would point out to
 
-4-
you  that  you  are  up  against  some  Paul  Bunyans,
 politically
 
speaking, who are preparing to move into the vacancies that would
 
occur  should  the  Endowment  collapse.
 I think  that  one  of  the
 
things that needs to happen is that the conversation should stop
 
talking about the National Endowment for the Arts and begin to talk
 
about what is  important about federal participation in the Arts.
 
What would be our ideal way of doing this?
 A lot of people think
 
that the Endowment did a lot of wrong things, and I do too.
 I have
 
many  quarrels  with  it  which  I have  delivered  myself  of  very
 
vociferously while I was working there.
 But,  I also think that we
 
will  find  ourselves  with  a black  hole  that  will  be  very,  very
 
difficult to defend.
 I think we should be ready for a big battle.
 
Let me talk just about a couple of other things.
 Let me talk,
 
with the best of intentions,  about "hows"  instead of "whats".
 It
 
just bubbles out of me.
 I am a standard European American.
 I love
 
technology.  I love to think about how to do things!
 I have been
 
telling you about how to be a Brer Rabbit  and how to  be a Paul
 
Bunyan and I haven't told you "what" yet at all.
 I would like to
 
talk a little bit about the whats if I can force myself into that
 
line of thinking.
 One of the first things I think we must say is
 
that  it  is  time  in  the  world  of  the  arts  to  stop  talking
 
multiculturalism and  be  multicultural.
 We  go  on  and  on  and  on
 
discussing it and we don't "be"  it because it is very hard work.
 
It really is.
 It is very,  very difficult and it is difficult not
 
because of a lack of good intentions and feelings and everything.
 
It  is hard to understand other peoples and other peoples have a
 
hard time understanding us.
 
My brother-in-law was in the Merchant Marine during WWII and
 
he  got  stuck  in  a bleak port  in North Africa,  which was  really
 
nothing but a bunch of sheds, waiting for some kind of ship to come
 
by.  He made friends with a little Arab boy.  There wasn't anything
 
there  to  do.
 There  was  not  a cafe. .  . there  was  nothing.
 This
 
little boy was one of the sons of the laborers there.
 The child
 
-5-
spoke a couple words of English and Pete learned a couple words of
 
Arabic and they tried and they played little finger games and they
 
drew things in the sand.
 They amused each other and tried to be
 
friends.
 The  little boy one day said,  "I write English."
 Pete
 
said,  "Oh wow,  can you?
 I will get you a piece of paper and a
 
pencil."
 He got out a piece of paper and pencil and the little
 
boy made four staggering capitals:
 P,  I,  H,  S.
 It spelled ship
 
when you looked at it.
 There it was!
 SHIP.
 The little boy had
 
learned this from the ships that came by looking at the things on
 
the side and he could spell ship.
 And he did it just fine.
 He was
 
making a good solid Arab try at a cross cultural experience with
 
the very,  very best hardworking intentions  (much harder work than
 
Peter was putting into it).
 Based on the fact that he was going
 
from right to left instead of left to right,  he couldn't build on
 
that and he couldn't ever learn how to spell PUSH for instance, but
 
that didn't hit him at all.
 But,  he was working hard!
 That SHIP
 
comes  into  my  mind  all  the  time  when  I am  talking  with  people
 
because I have to continually understand deep inside myself that
 
things that I think I understand could be absolutely backwards.
 I
 
could be operating exactly the wrong way around and so could the
 
people that are trying so hard to get together with me.
 Now,  my
 
dear  friends,  when  you  have  that  relationship,  when  you  really
 
understand that, when you really get that into your heads and you
 
have that relationship with people who come in to talk to you about
 
arts work,  you are going to stop talking like this terrible model
 
we have of the grantor and the supplicant, the lord and the peasant
 
that  is  coming  in  to  get  funds.
 You  are  not  going  to  do  that
 
anymore.
 You are working conjointly on a problem connected with
 
art in which you can put in some money,  but boy they have got to
 
put in some things too.
 It is a reciprocal relationship and I urge
 
you to try it.
 I urge you to use that as a model.
 I was thinking
 
at yesterday's session that here we are in a place talking about
 
philanthropy really.
 The philanthropic system of this country...
 
and  it suddenly hit me right here  in this meeting that we don't
 
talk about anybody else's system of philanthropy,  do we?
 
-6-
Now other peoples take care of their arts;
 other people take care
 
of their education system and their health system and so they have
 
ways of doing that.  But those don't ever come into the discussion.
 
I know,  just from visiting a little bit, that most American Indian
 
tribes,  for example,  have a system that is very reciprocal.
 They
 
have  potlatches
 and  giveaways
 and,
 when  you
 give
 somebody
 
something, they are obligated to give you something back.  Now that
 
puts  a different  spin  on  how  we  should  be  giving  money  away,
 
doesn't it?
 Maybe we are putting burdens on people.
 Maybe they
 
want  that,  but  maybe  there  ought  to  be  a  different  kind  of
 
discussion, which is what I am suggesting here.
 Maybe we ought to
 
think  (although  I have to point  out  to you  in all  honesty  that
 
there comes another "how"  instead of a "what")  about a few other
 
things.
 How about apprenticeships?
 What I would like for you to
 
do is whether you are a Paul Bunyan or a Brer Rabbit,  I would like
 
you to take on a problem,  not just an institution.
 We have to get
 
out of that institutional setting which,  in fact,  is one of the big
 
strong  things  about  the  FolkArts  program.
 We  were  so  under-
institutionalized that we never had to fight that battle.  You guys
 
are stuck with it,  but you can begin to pull it down a bit.
 How
 
about doing something to try to really take care of the needs of
 
the  performing  arts?
 They  need  rehearsal  space,
 they  need
 
publicity materials, they need all kinds of things right across the
 
board.
 That  is  a  big  problem.
 It  goes  from  New  York  to
 
California.
 Visual artists need supplies.
 How about some kind of
 
a cheap  warehouse  where  people  could  buy  not-for-profit  priced
 
photographic material,  artistic materials?
 
There was an old blind lady named Mrs.  Emma Doozenberry.
 She
 
used to live in Mena,  Arkansas.
 She was born blind and she sang.
 
By  the  time  many  folklorists  found  her,  she  knew  hundreds  and
 
hundreds  of  songs  all  the way through.
 She  sat there with her
 
blind eyes looking out and she was just a river of song.
 One time
 
somebody  asked  her  how  she  came  to  know  so  many  and  she  said,
 
"Well, you know when I was a little girl,  I decided I was going to
 
-7-
learn every song in the world.
 Every single one.
 And so,  every
 
song I heard I learned it and I learned and I learned and that is
 
how I know these songs."
 The folklorist said to her,  "Well,  Ms.
 
Doozenberry,  did  you  succeed  in  learning  all  the  songs  in  the
 
world?
 Did you ever get there?"
 She said,  "No,  I had to quit.
 
They kept on making up new ones."
 I think that is the beauty of
 
the work that we are involved in.  The artists and the troubles are
 
out there enduring and they keep on making up new ones for us,  so
 
we'll always have something exciting to do and to get together for
 
and to join hands on and to have a wonderful time.
 So finish up in
 
great  spirits,  go  home  and  remember  what  you  learned,  and  if
 
anybody ever wants to give me a call,  I am in that little address
 
book.

Dear Ms. Hawes:
 
On behalf of the National Endowment for the Arts I an
 
pleased to appoint you as a member of the National
 
Heritage Fellowships Panel for the FOLK & TRADITIONAL
 
ARTS Program.
 The panel will meet March 8-10,  1995.
 
As you know, the Endowment is the Federal grantmaking
 
agency that Congress created to support the visual,
 
literary,  design,  and performing arts,  to benefit all
 
Americans.
 The Arts Endowment's mission is twofold:  to
 
foster the excellence,  diversity,  and vitality of the
 
arts in the United States; and to help broaden the
 
availability and appreciation of the arts, bringing the
 
best art to the most people.
 In fulfilling this mission,
 
our authorizing statute advises the Endowment that the
 
public funding of the arts should foster mutual respect
 
for the diverse beliefs and values of all persons and
 
groups.
 The Endowment seeks to encourage works of
 
substantial artistic and cultural significance that
 
reflect American creativity, professional excellence,  and
 
cultural diversity.
 
The Endowment is advised by the National Council on the
 
Arts,  and assisted by advisory panels in each program
 
area.
 Each application receives three independent levels
 
of review.
 The first level,  in which you will
 
participate,  is the advisory panel, which discusses
 
applications and supporting materials and makes
 
recommendations for funding.
 The second is the
 
consideration and review of panel recommendations in open
 
meeting by the National Council on the Arts,  a
 
Presidentially appointed body.
 The third is final
 
decision on grants by the Chairman.
 Customarily,  each
 
panel meets once a year and the Council meets quarterly.
 
Your participation in the panel is a matter of public
 
record and some panel sessions may be open.
 However,  all
 
panel discussions concerning applications and other
 
sensitive matters will be closed to the public.
 
-2-
Your task as a panelist is to make recommendations as to which
 
applications best exemplify artistic excellence and artistic
 
merit,  and,  in some cases,  to inform policy in the field.
 
For each day spent at panel meetings, panelists will receive an
 
honorarium of $100.00.
 This honorarium must be understood as
 
only a token of our appreciation for the invaluable work done by
 
the panelists.
 Also,  the Endowment reimburses travel costs and
 
per diem expenses up to a fixed maximum for each city.
 The
 
compensation of panelists  (honorarium,  travel costs,  and per
 
diem)  is handled on a contract basis.
 A separate contract is
 
drawn up for each panel meeting.
 
The FOLK & TRADITIONAL ARTS staff will communicate further with
 
you concerning the contract requirements.
 They will also
 
provide you with more specific information about the FOLK &
 
TRADITIONAL ARTS Program and about dates and assignments for the
 
panel meeting.
 
If it would be helpful to you to have a copy of this letter of
 
appointment and the explanatory information provided by the
 
Program Director sent to an official of your organization,
 
please advise the Program as soon as possible.
 
We very much look forward to working with you,  and are confident
 
that your participation on the National Heritage Fellowships
 
Panel will be a mutually rewarding experience.
 
Sincerely,
 
Jand Alexander
 
Chairman
 
The bad part of this is that I don; -L
-- know if the way I feel is because
 
of the traditions I didn't represent with sufficient fire or because I
 
am just feeling let down by my peers.
 
I keep feeling that I should -
-
 dammit -
-
 have worked harder and spoken
 
more eloquently for the small traditions I had hoped to present at this
 
meeting.
 I shouldn't have let Joe Wilson get away with his eloquent plea
 
for the down-trodden Appalachian luthiers  (who no-one had ever trodden down
 
to begin with).
 I kept thinking that surely somebody else besides me would
 
speak to the upper New York state dulcimer player or one of the Pacific
 
Island folks -
-
 all of them little and elegant and not terribly exciting
 
or influential and god knows not money-making.
 But nobody else did.
 And
 
this is a democratic society and I do believe deeply in the panel p4ofess of
 
collective judgments.
 
So I guess I was wrong for this year.
 Or maybe I just wasn't smart and
 
sharp enough -
-
 that's what's upsetting me.
 Joe and Worth ± k
x look at
 
this is a totally political process,  and they play off each other with
 
skill and mutual admiration for each other's slickness.
 
So, when I think back,  I do feel that I tried to support other people'
 
visions,  and they didn't support mine,  and I guess I am very angry about
 
it still.
 I wish I thought it would make me tougher next time around;  I
 
think instead it will make me less willing to participate.
 I just whould
 
have done a better job.

I had the honor of speaking at a similar occasion just one

I think one reason people are presently so worried and
 
behaving in such un-American ways in expressing their
 
worries, is because we're getting a little more crowded. We
 
run into each other a lot more often.  The Plymouth settlers,
 
after all,  probably never even heard of the Spanish
 
conquistadores  or the Pueblo Indians and vice-versa,  though
 
they were all living on the same continent at the same time,
 
But they were so far apart that nobody needed to worry over
 
the fact that all the different  folks  spoke different
 
languages and practiced different customs.  Nowadays we  live
 
closer together,  and that makes a big difference.
 
Besides,  for much of U.S.  history,  everybody thought that
 
cultural differences would just eventually go away,  because
 
everybody believed in the melting pot -
-
 the notion that
 
the whole United States  is a kind of huge boiling vat  into
 
which everybody who comes here tumbles,  to be melted into a
 
sort of standard-issue American.  The automobile magnate,
 
Henry Ford,  was once  supposed to have put on a dramatic
 
presentation of the melting pot theory at his plant in
 
Dearborn Michigan where he sent a parade of automobile
 
workers of all  shapes,  sizes,  and ethnicities out on the
 
stage dressed in their original national costumes.  And they
 
circled around into a kind of central tent  in which they tore
 
off their varied finery and came back out,  all dressed in
 
red,  white and blue,  waving American flags.
 
I do believe that most people in the  19th and early 20th
 
centuries really believed in and approved of the melting pot.
 
But a major problem kept arising -
-
 it didn't work,  and it
 
really hadn't ever worked the way it was supposed to.  Though
 
some folks melt  -
-
 and that's  just  fine if they want to
 
others simsply do not and will not melt,  and they go on kind
 
of floating around together in lumps.  Indeed this  is when the
 
idea of the so-called hyphenated-Americans came in,  because
 
people began talking about Greek-Americans,  Japanese-
Americans,  and so on,  by which they were trying to indicate
 
that these particular folks hadn't melted nor did they show
 
much signs of doing so.
 
So today,  even if the U.S.  Congress went completely insane
 
and decreed that not one new immigrant  should ever step on
 
our shores,  we Americans will go on,  as we are now and always
 
have been,  living in a multi-cultural society.  And that  isn't
 
so bad,  is  it?
 It's kind of nice.  We might try to think more
 
about those nice parts.
 
What have we to offer each other across the cultural lines
 
what have we to gain from each other?
 The beauties of
 
differences -
-
 the reassurance of similarities.
 
Oh,  I know it's  complicated,  trying to understand and get
 
along with different kinds of folks.  Back during World War II
 
my husband's brother was  in the merchant marine,  stranded in
 
a desolate Saudi Arabian port town waiting for his ship to
 
clear.  He got to be  friends with a little Arab boy,  a bright
 
cheerful  little  fellow;  they taught each other games and
 
words  from their languages and sort of palled around.  One day
 
the  little boy said proudly that he could write an English
 
word -
-
 and given a piece of paper and a pencil,  he did -
-
four staggering capitals that  spelled SHIP.  But the way he
 
did it was the Arab way.  He wrote it right to left the way
 
Arabic is written -
-
 P I H 5-- spells SHIP,  doesn't it,  when
 
you  just  look at  it?
 He got the result  just  fine,  but he
 
used a different process,  and that was all right except that
 
he couldn't use his experience to go any further,  to spell
 
PUSH,  for  instance.
 
Lots of our attempts to reach across cultural distances
 
founder because we like the differences but we don't really
 
understand the processes,  how those differences come about.
 
And maybe,  in a nation like ours that contains  such an
 
astounding number of different  cultural groups,  we  just can't
 
hope to learn them all.
 
We can try to understand and learn -
-
 and we ought to -
-
 but
 
we need simpler ways to get together.  One way is to
 
concentrate on areas that have been invented and developed by
 
each ethnicity or tribe or people to explain themselves,  to
 
show themselves off with -
-
 to make their own public
 
statement about how nifty it  is to be a Pueblo Indian or a
 
Cambodian or a fellow from Veracruz or a lady from  (Colorado
 
region?)
 
We can concentrate on these people's arts, for that  is  just
 
what art does-- explaining,  demonstrating the special beauty
 
of each special people.  Now,  the traditional arts are the
 
old-timers,  tried and tested through the years,  and they do
 
the  job of showing off the wonderful things about each group
 
perhaps the most clearly.  But all art grows out of tradition,
 
and shows  it one way or another.  We'll undoubtedly understand
 
this better when we actually go outside and begin to look at
 
the Chile Harvest Arts Festival  itself.
 
So now,  with my time almost up,  here  I am finally getting
 
around to what  I was  invited here to speak about to begin
 
with -
-
 arts  festivals and what they' re for.  I
' ve  just  said
 
a word or two about art,  how about  festivals? Well,  there are
 
lots of wonderful things about festivals,  but the principle
 
one  is that they are built  for rejoicing;  they are designed
 
to make people happy.  That's what they do -
-
 help people mark
 
something as  special,  make things festive.
 And when that
 
happens,  when there is an atmosphere of true celebration,  all
 
of us tend to bring out the best and most generous sides of
 
ourselves.  And that makes us rejoice even more,  to be in such
 
fine company with such fine people.
 
Now the thing that really makes me happy about the CHAC
 
Festival  is that during a time of tight,  frightened,
 
neighbor-against-neighbor feelings,  you folks out here in
 
Denver figured out how to make a creative response to the
 
currently fashionable negative atmosphere.  You took two
 
things that everyone agrees are nice,  and they want them and
 
they like them,  and you put them together!  An arts  festival
 
and a botannical garden. What a great idea!  What a powerful
 
combination!  Nature and culture  joining together and working
 
together,  the way they are  supposed to.  I surely do hope
 
you' ve got all those gorgeous peppers growing here again this
 
year;  I found that part of the garden absolutely thrilling
 
last year,  along with the  santos and the paintings and the
 
tropical plants and the matachines.
 
I don't know if you really realize how remarkable this event
 
is,  how enabling your vision,  how exemplar7 your conduct.
 
I'll bet you' ve had an awful lot of fights bringing it all
 
off.  Getting two very different groups of people together
 
isn't easy;  it was the strength of the idea that has pulled
 
you this  far,  I'll bet.  I really congratulate you all.
 
A writer named Gary Snyder used an image in a recent book
 
that made me think right away of the CHAC Chile Harvest
 
Festival.  He was talking about the values of virgin forests
 
and the knowledge and wisdom of the peoples who originally
 
lived there.  And he said that each place and each people has
 
its own humus to grow in,  a special nourishing soil that has
 
been in place for a long time.  For human beings,  their humus
 
is  composed of custom,  myth,  lore,  art;  as it ages and is
 
consumed,  new cultural items are added in with the old to
 
keep enriching the soil where the children grow.  I believe
 
that the Chile Harvest Festival will become an important part
 
of the humus  in which the children of Denver will thrive and
 
mature.  Thank you for inviting me here to help you celebrate.

Chile Harvest Festival;
 Glossary of musical terms
 
(Notes by Brenda Romero)
 
August 25,  1995
 
Conjunto -
 lit.  " c o
m b o
"
.
 Originally the Cuban conjunto.
 In the
 
1940s the Chicano Conjunto became the standard backing for
 
corridos,  rancheras,  and other vocal forms.
 In the Southwestern
 
U.  S.  it has come to mean Tex-Mex,  Norteno style, with an
 
accordion lead,  guitar,  and/or bajo sexto,  and often a bass.
 
Corridos -
 Ballads usually about tragic or memorable,  public
 
events.
 
Rancheras -
 The equivalent of North American country music.
 
It is sung in an emotional style,  one of whose
 
characteristics is a held note at the end of a line,
 
culminating in a "dying fall"  (John Storm Roberts in
 
The Latin Tinge). 
This characteristic described by Roberts
 
amounts to a popular cultural musical symbol;  it is
 
also heard frequently in corridos.
 
Nortenas -
 Songs from the northern parts of
 
Mexico,espeCially along the Tex-Mex Border.
 
Cuinbias -
 originally from Colombia;  a dance music with much
 
African influence.
 
Danza Azteca -
 Traditional dance of the Meshica (Aztec)  tribe,  as
 
it has evolved in Mexico and the Southwestern United States.
 Use
 
of the huehueti,  a sacred drum for the Aztecs.
 
Flamenco -
 In Spain,  this is the music of the gypsies.
 It is not
 
ethnically Spanish,  although it is the most famous of folk music
 
from Spain.
 The gypsies originally came from South India,  and
 
flamenco still incorporates some remnants of South Indian dance,
 
such as the hand movements and rhythmic footwork.
 Because
 
gypsies in Spain came across North Africa,  flamenco also
 
incorporates in interlocking rhythmic patterns from Sub-Saharan
 
Africa that have influenced North Africa.
 Flamenco
 son
g style is
 
highly influenced by the Moors  (Arabs) who lived in Spain from
 
711 to 1492.
 There are many different dance types,  including
 
Alegrias,  Bulerias,  Seguidillas,  and others.
 
Bulerias -
 Intricate,  12-beat,  fast,  improvised dance with
 
guitarist;  difficult rhythms.
 Done in fiesta,  upbeat style.
 
Seguidillas -
 A kind of blues;  heavy,  deep,  cante hondo
 
(profound song).
 
Alegrias -
 A kind of folk bulerias;  uses folk melodies,
 
lighter than bulerias, with set melodies in different
 
sections to form a suite.
 The dancer interprets the light
 
mood in her own style.
 
March -
 A procession  (march)  and intricate web that the leaders
 
do to showcase the bride and groom who end up dancing in the
 
middle of a circle.
 Couples are led into different dance
 
formations,  like a bridge for people to go under;  this and other
 
aspects of the marcha have visual,  psychological,  and religious
 
symbolical effects.
 
Entriega -
 (Entrega is the newer spelling)  -
 Borders on being
 
religious,  depending on the verses that are sung.
 Some of the
 
verses include reference to the Virgin Mary,  to God,  and to the
 
witnesses of the marriage and members of the community.
 The
 
marriage itself is seen as a metaphor for the foundations of
 
faith.
 Rudy Bustos commented to me that traditionally we as
 
religious people often feel that marriage is a lifetime
 
commitment.
 Yet modern urban culture does not see marriage as
 
permanent -
-
 assimilation has done that to us.
 Playing the
 
Marcha and Entriega are a way of reinforcing the oldcr, mole
 
rural values of permanance, despite the urban setting.
 
Manito Music -
 the traditional music of New Mexico and Southern
 
Colorado;  usually accompanied only by violin and guitar.
 What
 
Rudy Bustos calls "ranchero manitos.tt
 
Manito is short for
 
"hermanito"  for brother.
 
Mariachi -
 A wide-ranging musical tradition from southern Mexico
 
that has steadily grown in popularity in the Southwest United
 
States since the early part of this century.
 It is celebratory,
 
upbeat,  fast (typically), and the musicians dress in the Mexican
 
charro outfit made popular in Mexican films of the 30s and 40s.
 
The name, mariachi,  comes from a kind of wood used to make
 
instruments in the southern regions Mexico.
 The players are
 
often virtuosic players on the violin,  guitar,  guitarron (large
 
bass-guitar),  and vihuela (a 5-string rhythm guitar without
 
frets).
 They play Mexican sones.
 (And today many other genres.)
 
Son (p1. sones) -
 Generic for song/dance genres.  (Mexico)
 
Huapangos -
 A son style from the Huastec region
 
of Veracruz.
 Huapangos include falsetto  (falsette)  and song
 
verses are often sung back and forth between two singers.
 
The violin style is distinct.
 
Bolero -
 Rhythmically similar to huapangos,  but more
 
closely related to classical music styles  (bel canto opera
 
style);  love songs.
