anchor on scow drags.  Taking a tender back out to reset anchors.  Towing to

10:00-15:00

and sailing to Mexico 
 
15:00-20:00  Buying land on Galanikin Island getting job at Sitka shipyard doing shipwright 
repair work on wooden fishing boats.  Learning wooden boat building and repair.  
1984 only one welder in Sitka.  Starting to do metal fabrication.  Learning to weld 
aluminum.  Opening boat shop specializing in metal work, learning to weld.  
Reading, and self-taught. 
 
20:00-25:00 
Being one of two welders in town, only marine fabricator.  Busy from day one.  
Shop next to the Sitka Shipwright Coop. Loving the work boat repair by day 
reading and studying boat work.  Learning how to find and buy shop equipment 
before the internet.   
 
25:00-35:00 
Getting Stationary tools for shop 35 years of developing business. Repairing the 
FV Archangel. Boat went on rocks on first trip, being hired for metal fabrication 
Hires Deuce, deckhand on boat. Legendary fishing family.  Icy Queen.  Five-year 
training process when hiring new person to get fully up to speed.  Hiring welders 
doesn’t work, to set in their ways resist re-learning.  Having background in 
wooden boat repair focus on the “fit” of pieces. Consistent fit, consistent welds, 
strength and beauty versus “shipyard” tradition, heavy plates fit not critical, 
focus to just get into water quickly, versus precision.  Orientation toward quality.  
Identifying as a welder is not accurate.  Fabricator is welder, in same way a 
carpenter is a nailer, design layout, fitting, welding. 
 
35:00-40:00 
Finding good crew, admiration of work, willingness to learn, reliability.   Changes 
in fishing fleet.  Movement from wood to aluminum watching first custom and 
commercial welded aluminum boats come about.  Boats built down south not 
built tough enough for Alaska work condition.

40:00-45:00 
Changes in costs, can’t see how people can afford to build boats.  High speed, 
high fuel usage, faster more expensive Bristol Bay model, Southeast Alaska, 
fishing profits more marginal.   
 
45:00-50:00 
Cannot give advice to next generation.  World changed to much from when 
started, can only advise based on experience.  People are more forward thinking 
and business oriented.  Days of being able to come to Alaska with nothing are 
over.  Traits that lead to success in fishing in Alaska, trails that would result in 
failure down south.  Conformist, work within the rules gets an easy life.  Success 
in fishing, fanatical, work hard in unbelievable conditions.  Contrasts are not as 
extreme as they use to be.  Point in time where opportunity to access fishing, 
change openness and opportunity in Alaska.  Limited Entry limited access to 
salmon trolling.  IFQ program, milestone in death of small boat fisherman.   IFQ 
biggest impediment to entering fishing. Can try with marginal fisheries like jig 
and dingle bar fishing.  Harder than it was before. 
 
50:00-56:45 
Learned was not a good fisherman. Having a boundless interest for boats and for 
boats in this region.  The Traditional wooden troller as absolute pinnacle of 
human ability, skill and design.  The curves found on the classic Pacific Northwest 
fishing boats are not found anywhere else with that level of sophistication or 
skill.  Working with them.  Prolonging their lives and being around them,  
Fortunate to come to Alaska when fisheries were lucrative , not crowded, and 
prices were u, possible to make a living doing boat work and fishing.    
Abundance of work opportunities fortunate conditions for the creation of a life. 
Being a Romantic
