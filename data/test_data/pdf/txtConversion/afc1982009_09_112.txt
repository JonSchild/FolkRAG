McKinley Brim in Tobacco Field 
BR8-TE-1 
Identification 
McKinley Brim picking sucker leaves 
from his bright leaf tobacco plants. 
He plants less than five acres of 
tobacco each year. The Brim family 
farm is located in the Carter's Mill 
community of Virginia near the town 
Ararat—Carter's Mill is on C.R. 814 
off of C.R. 774. 
He strips the plants in the morning, 
as part of his morning chores. Doing 
a few rows each day, rather than the whole) 
planting all at once. If these sucker 
leaves were not removed, it would cut 
down on the quality of the mature tobacco 
leaves. Tobacco is a hand crop. 
"no machine can care and pick tobacco," 
Brin told me as he walked rows and 
spoke of getting the second picking 
ready for market next week.

tricks and toys, but it was the 
need to do something after his

that got him involved with carving

Cabbage Farm--VA. 
Identification 
The Goins Brother's Cabbage farm 
in both Carroll and Patrick co 
of VA. They started farming cabbage 
in 1947 with their father. It was 
a shoestring operation. The brothers 
(Three of the) went into other businesses.! 
About seven years ago everyone came 
back up the mountain from Mt. Airy 
and started farming the family land. 
The now farm about 150 acres. Most 
of the workers are teenage relatives 
and friends. Although this year for 
the first time they hired 5 Mexicans 
The Goins are the second growers to 
hire Mexican/migrant labor. The Banks' 
farm started bringing in migrants about 
3 years ago. 
Goins contracts cabbage from the field 
to the store. They run a direct sales 
operation delivering cabbage up and 
down the east coast. Philly to Miami 
and as far west as Louisville (Lowelville)I 
High School friends packing cabbage 
for summer money. They go to school 
at Lorel Fork. Summer for them is 
picking and packing cabbage and running 
the roads at night.

A lot of spraying goes on the modern 
crop. 15 years ago you would 
spray a crop once or twice. Now the 
crops are sprayed 10-12 times before 
they are picked. The biggest 
crop worry is club root...an 
unexplained root desease that they 
do not know how to stop.

The Akers tent revival is 
known as a fourty miler on the 
revival circuit . Robert Akers 
of Hillsville Va. is a contractor 
during the weekdays...and a preacher 
at night. He has a regular church 
just north of Hillisville on 221 
that he heads for Sunday services 
as well as a radio program. He 
has heard the message of the Lord 
and is spreading it daily. 
He sets his tent into an area 
for two or three weeks at a time. 
Always within an area close to 
Hillsville in driving distance. 
Thus the name 40 mil&r. 
The service is a series of songs 
spaced with testimonials and special 
singing. A series of warm up acts 
until Akers presents his special 
message in song and testimonial leading 
to the sermon. 
This was the closing night of the 
revival in Galax. Akers is a sharp 
well meaning man, who cares for 
his followers and the message he brings. 
He was pleased by our pressence,yet, 
concerned that we were not out to 
make them look foolish.

An example of his craft and under¬ 
standing of how to end a two week 
(or better) stay in Galax. When the 
final alter call was given there was 
only one young (7) man who came 
forward. Akers then switched his 
call to ask all Christians to 
come forward to pray for new spirit 
and guidance. Suddenly the alter 
was filled. The sprit...the 
chanting...the trimbling....the 
joy became overwhelming and 
infectious. It is ending the stay 
on an very positive note. 
Many of the people attending the 
service follow Akers on his rounds. 
Perhaps as many as 15 percent of the 
200 or so people are nightly people 
and would follow Akers to the next 
town-or wherever.
