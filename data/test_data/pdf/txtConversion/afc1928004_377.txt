We are very often told, 
All that glitters is not gold, 
And we're not as we all ought to be; 
And you'd quite believe it true, 
If you saw the things I 
do, 
When I 
get upon the strict " Q. T." 
Cnonus. 
Oh, my ! what a 
pious world this is, 
And how very good we all seem to be; 
What a 
duffing lot you find, 
If you only raise the blind, 
And see us on the strict " Q. T." 
Old ladies oft declare, 
Girls should never wear false hair, 
The locks ,that once adorned another she, 
Or to use that lily-white; 
But they draw the curtains tight, 
And use it on the strict " Q. T." 
Oh, my! etc. 
With a 
lady when you dine, 
And you ask her to take wine, 
She says " I 
couldn't touch it," not for me! 
Say " Mum's the word," make haste! 
And I 
think you'll find she'll taste. 
That " mum " upon the strict " Q. T." 
Oh, my! etc. 
Just take a 
pretty miss, 
And offer her a 
kiss, 
When there's anybody standing by, to see, 
She'd say she'd rather die, 
But you may snatch it on the sir, 
And she'll like it on the strict " Q. T." 
Oh, my ete

The Russians in the East, 
Were preparing for a 
feast, 
They meant to carve the Turkey, don't you see? 
They said, " It's peace were on," 
But their little game was Con-
Stantinople on the strict " Q. T." 
Oh, my ! etc. 
Each girl a 
little puff, 
Will in her pocket stuff, 
She cannot do without it, all agree, 
And her pretty little nose she'll powder, 
When a 
moment is allowed her, 
To do it on the strict " Q. T." 
Oh, my! etc. 
When Sunday comes you fear, 
You can not get your beer, 
It's forbidden in the city of the free, 
it's naughty, but its nice, 
But if von ask for " Weiss," 
get, in on the strict " Q. T." 
Oh, my ! etc. 
Now, there's the needy swell, 
Who calls a 
girl a gell," 
Wears an -Ulster quite a 
yard below his knee. 
Then comes the ancient beau, 
Upon whose cheek there is a 
glow.

AWFULLY AWFUL. 
Written and composed by U. W. HUNT. 
Sung by LYDIA TUOMPSON. 
They tell me I 
am too bashful by far, 
And, sometimes, I 
think they are right, 
But so awfully naughty the masculincs are., 
No wonder one feels in a 
fright; 
I've been led to believe men were born to deceive, 
So when they, their compliments pay, 
in language absurd, I 
don't hear a 
word, 
But, first, as a 
caution I 
say. 
CHORUS. 
Go away, get along, go along, get away! 
You don't say what you mean, or mean what you say, 
Go away, naughty boy, go ever so far, 
You are so awfully awful, you are! 
When I 
go to a 
ball, and one asks me to dance, 
At the finish I 
soon slip away, 
For I 
know Mr. Noodle, if he has tide chance, 
Is sure to have something t
o 
say ; 
So I 
stop the sad man, as soon as I 
can, 
In case he'd be going too far, 
Perhaps what he'd tell me, he has told two or three, 
For such sad Don Giovanni's they are. 
Go away, etc. 
I 
dread Christinu,,, 
whene'er it collies round, 
Tho' it's awfully jolly, I 
know, 
But so many young men, again and again, 
Lead me under the mistletoe ; 
Ohl and would you believe, on last Christmas eve, 
I 
found a 
voun man at my feet, 
With an offer of marriage, a 
mansion, and carriage, 
Of course, I 
soon beat a 
retreat. 
Go away, etc.

If I 
WaS only long enough, 
A soldier I 
would be, 
The girl I 
thought would be my wife, 
llas proved 60 fahie to me. 
She's turned me up, and now walks out, 
With one she calls her swain, 
Whose whims and psalms outdone my charms, 
And nearly turned my brain 
SPOKEX.—Yes. I'm mad. 
To think the girl— the only one I 
ever loved—should give me lip for another. 
And— 
f 
I 
was on'y long enough, a 
soldier I 
would be. 
To fight fot my country, and be revenged on she. 
Then if a 
war broke out, she'd never see me. more, 
But away, yes away. I'd go off to the war. 
The donkey rides I've had with her, 
The shrimps, the lovely teas. 
And trousers that cost t•rt-!- -:3 and six, 
I've worn out at the knees: 
Through making love, like fellows do, 
In some secluded spot; 
But all my spooning was in vain. 
The girl she loved me not, 
SPOKEN'. —She loved another. 
A woman that would fool a. 
man that had paid sixpence in one day for ginger beer and don-
key rides, is not worthy the name of woman. 
She's—well, 
never mind. 
If I 
was, etc. 
At night I 
dream of battle fields, 
And fancy I 
am there, 
With blood all round, and cannon balls 
All flying In the air; 
And on the field I 
met the wretch, 
Who's caused our love to part, 
And as we're standing face to face, 
I 
stab him through the heart. 
SPOKEN.—Ha! ha! ha! 
I 
stab him to the heart. 
If I 
was, etc. 
Short soldiers at the seat of war, 
Have gained old England fame, 
And p'raps Joe Smith of Seven Dials, 
Will make as great a 
name • 
And she that's proved so false to me, 
May see my name inscribed, 
In the annals of her country, ha, 
Among the brave that died. 
SPOKEN.—'-Drunk— 
If I 
was, etc.

He always came home to tea.

Tins is trash I'm writing,

For a

As this to be rather short 
Of a

'Tis featlul to want a

This wicked world you can never get thro', 
Lest you're possessed of a

if you your friends would try, 
There's but one thing to do, 
Just ask them to lend you 
Put a

Anti you will find your sworn friends 
Tum their backs upon you, 
For it is dreadful to want 
Just a

Ohl one evening lately. I 
dressed up nately, 
I 
put on my Sunday clothes, plug- hat and all; 
And I 
started proudly. while whistling loudly, 
For Neal Bro:ran's, rattle at Hibernia Hall. 
Going round a 
corner, a 
gang of rowdies: 
Oh! I 
know they're rowdies for they never work, 
Says, let give this ould Tad a 
racket, 
We will have a 
pie-nie, boys, and toss the Turk. 
CHORUS. 
Now I'm not a 
fighter, nor yet a 
biter. 
But when duty calls inc I 
never shirk ; 
So I'll tell you plainly, tho' I 
look ungainly, 
That they had no pic-nic when they toss'd the Turk. 
Oh I 
the big ring-leader, a 
free lunch raider, 
Says, " O'Brien you had better paint the ' tile,' 
Put crape around it, get an axe and pound it!" 
And he thought ' twas funny when the gang did smile. 
It was then my dander rose like a 
gander, 
For I 
heard one loafer say he'd flash a 
dirk; 
So I 
tapp'd him lightly, and surprised him quitely, 
And they had no pie-nic when they toss'd the Turk. 
Now I'm not, etc. 
Oh! they gather'd round me, and thought to pound me, 
But I 
put my back against a 
big brick wall; 
You can't go behind me, says I, now mind me, 
If you stand forenint me I 
can bate ye all. 
Titer- the gang did face me and thought to lace me, 
But I 
showed them tricks I 
learned at Donegal; 
Right and left I 
pounded, they were dumbfounded, 
And at last for mercy they began to bawl. 
Spoken after 3d verse.—" Well, they looked surprised, and 
'Red Handed Mike' says, ' Who are you?' 
Well, says I, my 
name is Cornelius Thomas Francis Meagher O'Brien, and, 
moreover," 
I'm not, etc.

WAKE NOT MY DARLINGS. 
Composed by MATT O'REARP4N.

HARDING, 229 Bowery, opposite 
Prince St. N. Y. 
Price 35 cents. 
Mv golden-hair'd darlings, disturb not their rest, 
Sweet Angels have 
them to sleep on my breast; 
O'er their calm slumbers a 
vigil they keep, 
My babes feel no hunger while buried in sleep. 
WhenCer they awake, my fond heart, in its dread, 
Grows sick in the fear that I 
cannot find bread 
To give to my dear ones, so please let them rest; 
While Angels are watching them, slumber is best. 
CHORUS. 
Tread softly, speak lightly, disturb not their rest, 
While Angels are guarding them, slumber is best. 
Hunger is bitter, while slumber is sweet, 
Wake not my darlings, they've nothing to eat. 
Lull them to rest! lull them to rest! 
Lull them to rest! lull them to rest! 
They say there is plenty and peace in the land, 
And that charity gives with a 
lavishing hand; 
Notwithstanding that church spires point to the skies, 
Wealth fattens on plenty, while poverty dies! 
There's one, by whose aid the sparrows are fed, 
And I've prayed unto him for our daily bread; 
feel that I'm going my Saviour to meet, 
Where Ill not see my darlings want something to eat! 
Tread softly, etc. 
SHY, SHY, DREADFULLY SHY. 
HAD I 
been a 
monk or a 
hermit that dwelt 
In a 
cave where the world could not see, 
I 
then might be quiet, collected and cool. 
But fate has not will'd it to be; 
I'm thrown on the world with its troubles and teals, 
To avoid them I 
every day try, 
I'm nervous, fidgety, very reserved, 
In fact, I'm most awfully shy, 
I 
can't look a 
girl in the face, but I 
blush, 
For I 
feel most awfully shy. 
CHORUS. 
Shy, shy, shy, shy!

I'm so shy—dreadfully shy, 
Shy, shy, shy, shy! 
I 
can't pass a 
stay shop, because I'm so shy. 
one people go to the theatre each night., 
To see actresses dress'd comma ilfaut, 
But I 
never will cast my eyes on the stage 
Unless the footlights they put low; 
There's the ballet girls too, so graceful to view, 
To see them is stretch'd ev'ry eye; 
To some this is good, but ' tis not to me, 
For I 
feel most awfully shy, 
Ballet girls' movements are all very well, 
But I 
feel most wretchedly 
Gtioutit. 
Shy, shy. shy, shy! 
Oh! I'm so shy—dreadfully shy, 
Shy, shy, shy, shy: 
would it I 
could, but I 
can't; I'm so shy. 
For all I'm so shy, I 
once fell in love, 
To my sweetheart no question could pop, 
For hours I 
would sit by my loved one and say— 
Nothing! and then I 
would stop; 
She put the question, I, blushing, said " yee 
Got married—I 
felt I 
should die, 
To think or the future, tea..s came to my eyes, 
I 
felt so terribly shy, 
Yes, to think of the future, tears came to my eyet, 
or 1 
felt so uncommonly shy.

FISHING IN THE STREAM, 
SCENIC DUET. 
Written by PETER F. 
STOUT. 
W ILL. 
I've been hanging round this place for two hours ; 
there lies my angling-rod. 
Luck ? you bet! 
Bites? millions 
of them, ' Skeeters though. 
Symphony begins. 
W ILL (BERTHA) sings. 
I 
sauntered down the creek to-day, 
And thought to try my skill, 
I 
cast my line a 
stone's-throw off, 
Below the Old Stone 
When, deeply musing, came a 
voice 
Like thunder, too, it seemed, 
" 
Get out, you city pirate! git!" 
"You're fishing in my stream!" 
FANNY ENTERS. 
Away I 
went— the bulldog came, 
You see that gaping seam? 
His teeth inserted, tor3 my pants, 
While fishing in the stream! 
FANNY. 
Dear Will, what's he matter? 
W ILL. 
I 
was fishing in the mill-race, when your delectable 
parent deliberately let loose his hound of war, who with malice 
aforethought, kc., (to., made a 
rush for me, and just as I 
was 
lifting my 128 avoirdupois over the hedge, got a 
bit, you see, 
and I 
assure you I 
shan't go back and ask him to return it. 
FANNY. 
Well, Will, he's the first clog that ever got a 
bit of 
TOU.

FANNY ( IDA) SINGS. 
Oh, don't! Oh, don't! you naughty Wili 
You never get enough, 
You city fellows crave us girls, 
And think we cannot bluff; 
I 
have a " stunner" in my eye, 
I 
haven't seen him, late, 
Ile's coming here to-night, about, 
Let's see. yes! half- past eight. 
He's not the lad to saunter round, 
And idly mope and dream, 
lie knows the time when luck's about, 
For fishing in the stream! 
We'll cast our lines, nor fear results, 
Life's ocean's deep and wide, 
We'll cheer each other as we tug, 
While rowing ' gainst the tide; 
And over shoals and hidden bars, 
We'll sail, yes, hand in hand, 
And on the other side, at last, 
Of Jordan, we shall stand! 
So flip your fine, nor mind the world 
What is life, but a 
dream? 
There's something more than suckers 
While fishing in the stream !

Then Sunday cycling came, and I 
On the corner, there, did wait, 
Where soon she met me and walk'd 
Thro' the Park until quite late ; 
We whisper'd words so low and sweet, 
For she's my darling " Kate ;" 
We said good-night, to meet again 
On Sunday eve at eight.

At a

Was my darling, fond and true ; 
We danced and spoke of the future bright,

Who'd a 
Thought or seeing You? 
Ag Sung by Romax HowAr.o. 
When strolling out we often meet 
With those we least expect ; 
Perhaps some old, old friend, whose face 
You can scarcely recollect ; 
Your pardon, sir—is your name Smith ? 
Yes, sir ; well, my name's Jones! 
Then joyfully you greet him, in 
The liveliest of tones— 
CliORUS. 
Who'd a 
thought of seeing you? 
Gracious me! how do you do ? 
Do I 
make a 
great mistake ? 
Or is it, really, you? 
[Repeat Chorus. 
A 
poor man, all at once, has money 
Left to him by will, 
Which lifts him from the bottom 
To the summit of the hill; 
He moves in best society, 
With lots of cash to spend ; 
But this should be his first greeting, with 
An old and seedy friend— 
Who'd a 
thought, &c.

A 
man of sixty marries, too, 
A 
girl of seventeen ; 
He has money—she has none--
The end is quickly seen. 
One night he goes home rather soon, 
And thinks how pleased she'll be ; 
But finds his precious wife upon 
Another fellow's knee! 
Who'd a 
thought, Itc. 
Just fancy getting married, on, 
.Say—fifty dollars per year— 
Minus friends—ditto, cash. 
You'l soon repent, I 
fear, 
When in due course it happens, that, 
To crown your everlasting joy, 
You find you are the father of 
A 
bouncing little boy ! 
CHORUS.

O'er everything else I've a

To flirt with the gents whom I

And tell me it should not be done— 
It is only a-game I

And it's only, just only in fun.

And many, I'm sure, are desiring, 
Attentions on me to testow.

ONE day while walking down Broadway 
I 
met my cousin Joe, 
He ask d 
me then if I 
wi Ii him 
To the Central Park would go. 
With my consent we then did start, 
And reached th lake at three, 
We took a 
sail, and words of love 
Were pass'd by Joe and me. 
Crionus. 
Sailing on the lake, 
To the music of the birds, 
The rippling of the waters 
And the sound of loving words. 
( 
On our return we took a 
stroll, 
And soon did reach the mall, 
When from the distance music sweet 
Upon our ears did fall. 
We sat and listened to the band, 
Beneath a 
hawthorn tree, 
While gentle breezes carried words 
Of love from Joe to me. 
Chorus.—Sailing on the lake, itc. 
Now Joe has asked me to be his, 
Of course I 
won't refuse, 
And Pa has given his consent— 
This chance I 
must not loose. 
And wl!en some day at Central Park 
The lake you go to see, 
I 
know you'll whisper words of love 
Like my dear Joe and me. 
Chorqs.—Sailing on the lake, 
As sung by LIzziE BRAHAm. 
Dear friends, again I 
greet you all, 
Your kindly smiling faces view, 
Which memory will oft recall, 
When I 
am far away from you. 
All have desires, if the truth were confessed, 
Some wish they could have wealth, 
But of all things I 
can wish you the best 
Are freedom, contentment And health. 
CHORUS. 
Then let us be content, 
Nor envy him who thrives, 
And may the present moment be 
The worst one of our lives. 
I 
hope that everything with you 
Will prosp'rous be in every way, 
And recollect, whate'er you do, 
To put by for a 
rainy day. 
Charity oft will make sorrow depart, 
No one should miserly hoard, 
But with a 
free hand and generous heart 
Give what your purse can afford. 
Then let us be content, &c. 
The ladies! that angelic sex, 
You know I'm always glad to see, 
And nothing me can ever vex 
When in their sweet society. 
Those who are married, whose husbands are kind, 
Trouble and care may defy, 
Those who are single I 
hope soon will find 
gusbands as happy as I. 
Then let us be content, kc.

I 
TOOK my love one evening, 
When the summer moon was beaming, 
Thro' the silent arbors gleaming, 
Where cupid has control. 
I 
wanted to tell her, 
How dearly I 
adored her; 
But Oh! she wouldn't listen, 
Tho' I 
tenderly itnplor'd her, 
Oh t 
love, oh! love, why don't you hoed ma, 
How can you treat me so. 
In vain, in vain, in vain, 
She heeded not my pain, 
he turn'd away her head, 
Aud this was all she said.

Ohl ain't you awful, 
It's wrong you know, to love me so, 
Yes you are awful,

Oh ! ain't you awful,

To make my feelings clearet 
I 
advanced a 
little nearer, 
And said I'd like to see her, 
Say yes and ease my mind, 
She fumbled and mumbled, 
And laughed at my attention; 
She said mamma wouLl scold her, 
If such things she dared to mentkv.. 
Come love I 
cried we'll run away, 
And leave your mamma behind, 
Oh no, oh no, she said, 
Don't ask me now to wed,

And drew her close beside me; 
But she began to fidget, 
And her roguish eyes defied me, 
And soon she told me with a 
Put* 
That she did not care for me, 
My love was all in vain, 
She heeded not my pain, 
She turned away her head, 
And this was all she said.

Find that they have got no show, 
Deeming you so proud and pert—

While, of course, just there and then

In a 
little cot by the brookside, 
Dwells a 
sweet one with lovely golden hair, 
It's of this little dear I 
will tell you, 
With a 
dashing style that is very rare. 
You should : ee her for she is bewitching, 
When she is dressed up in her suit of light blue, 
And looking up says " now, ain't I 
pretty ?" 
Tell me sweetness, ! tell me, ain't it true?" 
CHORUS. 
When she stands before her mirror, 
And I 
her try to please, 
Then I'll tell her that I 
love her, 
And then she'll coax and tease, 
Then she'll look up with a 
smile, she's so witty! 
" 
If you love me, tell me, ain't your darling pretty." 
The other morning we went out walking, 
And took a 
promenade upon the green, 
And I 
only wish you could have seen us, 
Such a 
gay sight never before was seen. 
tell you the lads they all me envy, 
And I 
so very unconcerned do seem, 
Yes, I 
think I 
heard " oh ! ain't she pretty?" 
A dozen times upon that vilage green. 
Chorus. 
But still these happy days are passing, 
And soon will be the day she'll be my bride, 
Oh! how dear I 
love the little darling, 
As through the future happy years we'll glide. 
To see her you'd envy and not pity, 
For all my cherished hopes I've centered there, 
The first thing you'd say " oh I 
ain't she pretty," 
With her flowing locks of bright golden hair.

By her little cottage gate;

Comb again some other night, 
Come just after candle light ! 
Now I

Oft I

Breathing words of fondest love, 
'Neath the shining stars above. 
Roses sleeping, never hear 
What I 
whisper in her ear: 
Sweetly smiling, she does say, 
As I 
leave her side to stray, 
Come again, etc.

We will ever fondly dwell. 
'Mid the bliss of wedlock's spell;

Don't Ask Me To Give Up Joe!

Such a 
charming beau is Joe; 
He has asked my hand in Marriage, 
But my Pa and Ma say no;

Give him up; but I 
say no; 
Ask any thing in this wide world, 
But don't ask me to give up Joe 1

Ask the little sparrows not to chirrup, 
Ask the tide to cease to ebb and flow; 
Ask the little lambs and sheepies not to bleaty pleaty, 
But don't ask me to give up Joe I 
Ask lovers not to ever quarrel, 
Or Dutchmen to leave their lager beer, 
Ask Greely- what he knows of farming, 
Ask the old maids why they act so queer, 
Ask Police to come when wanted ; 
Or unseen to let you go, 
Ask Alexis who shot the Buffalo, 
But don't ask me to give up Joe! 
CHORUS. 
Ask little fishes not to swim, please, 
Ask little flowers not to grow, 
Ask birdie-wirdies not to singie pingie, 
But don't ask me to give up Joe! 
Ask the " Committee of Seventy" to vamoose 
And no more indictments to find, 
Ask Bergh to let them shoot pigeons, 
When a 
fellow feels so inclined, 
Ask a 
man to leni you a 
dollar, 
When your funds have run quite low, 
Ask Gen'ral Grant to take no presents, 
But don't ask me to give up Joe I

Ask oysters not to bloom in Winter, 
Ask pumpkins on apple trees to grow, 
Ask little doggie-woggies not to barkie-warkta, 
But don't ask me to give up Joe 
Ask Mormons not to marry Young ; 
And editors to tell the truth, 
Ask old men to stick to facts 
When they tell us about their youth; 
Ask the lawyers never to charge a

And women's rights folks not to blow; 
Ask England to settle the Alabama Claims. 
But don't ask me to give up Joe I

Written and Compomed by G. W. Eiusr. 
Sung by J. L. THAYER. 
Now some girls are bashful, 
And others are bold, 
Now I 
know a 
charmer 
Of nineteen years old; 
About her—like some others— 
There was much pretense, 
For at the least thing 
She'd be sure to commence ( with her) 
CHORUS. 
Oh, my! fie, for shame, 
What would Mamma say? 
What would Papa say? 
Oh, my! fie, for shame; 
Get along Joseph, do. 
I'd take her about 
To wherever she'd please; 
When we were alone 
She'd appear ill at ease; 
Now a 
kiss, once a 
week, 
Every fellow'd expect, 
But when 1 
tried for one, 
She'd be sure to object (with her) 
Oh, my! fie, for shame, &A 
Her Pa and her n. 
Out of town chanced to be, 
So I 
called on my charmer, 
And with her took tea; 
The time like a 
slow 
Quaker's meeting did pass, 
Till she somehow by accident 
Turned out the gas. 
SPOHEIN. — There we were all in Cie dark. I 
was afraid 
to move for fear of breaking something, and she couldn't 
or wouldn't find the matches; when she found I 
didn'l 
niorb, she said— 
Oh, my! fie. for shame, &c. 
She seemed, oh, so awfully 
Coy and demure, 
- 
That I 
thought her complaint 
Only marriage would cure; 
So I 
asked, " If she wed, 
Did she think she would die?" 
She pretended to faint, 
But her only reply was— 
Oh, my! fie, for shame, &c. 
Now I 
found out this bashful 
And timid young lamb 
Was simply a 
con-
glom-er-a-tion of sham; 
To two other parties 
Her kisses were free ; 
Perhaps she had one of them, 
But she didn't "have me," ( with her) 
Oh, my! fe, for shame, deCr 
Sung by W ESTERN SL ALLING, with great applause, 
at the National Comique, Cincinnati, 0., 
WHILE walking down the lane just now, 
With pleasure and surprise, 
I 
saw a 
pretty brunette face, 
She had such lovely eyes, 
She smiled, I 
winked, she kissed her hand, 
I 
beckoned her this way, 
l'll stop and wait a 
little while, 
To hear what she will say. 
ell ORES. 
I 
hope this young girl's not afraid, 
To come and meet me here, 
My heart's all in a 
flutter now, 
To see this brunette dear. 
I 
wonder where that young man's crone, 
That passed my house just now, 
I 
know his face but not his name, 
His style is grand I 
vow. 
He winked at me so slyly then, 
I 
kissed my hand that way. 
I'll stop and wait a 
little while, 
And see him come this way. 
CHORUS. 
I 
hope that young man's coining back, 
To show his style and grace, 
My hearts all in a 
flutter now, 
To see his handsome face. 
Please pardon my intrusion, Miss, 
Alt, its nothing more than fair, 
Your right is in flirtation, 
My name is Kitty Claire. 
Well now then say that little yea, 
And then you'll change your name, 
One kiss I'll have and then we'll go, 
Down in the shady lane.

WE 
often read of the power 
Of princes and -4 
kings, 
Who stripp'd of all their grandeur, 
Are but poor mortal things; 
Int there's a 
power strongcr, 
Which lasts for tine untold, 
To which all men must bow and that's 
The bright, bright Gold. 
CHORUS, 
Gold, Gold, Gold! I 
love to hear it ilny

Gold, Gold, Gold: its power is untold, 
We men strive hard to store it, 
And woman she'll adore it, 
The best friend that a 
man can have Ls 
Gold, Gold, Gold! 
The man that's 'pilaus moumW, 
The world will cell a 
nat. 
Ad 
pass him by, but il Ite's rich, 
will gaily raise its hat.; 
It sneers at the unlucky, 
But smiles on he who wine, 
And gold will gloss and cover, 
Quite a 
multitude of sins. 
The maid both plain and ancient 
Appears a 
perfect " sweet," 
If rich, her gold magnetic draws 
"Fond" lovers to her feet; 
Some say this Gold's a 
curse, and that 
It causes strife and pride, 
But we know it is 
blessing, 
When its properly applied. 
Gold, Gold, doei, 
Love and content in a 
cottage, 
I've heard of, so have you, 
But I 
fear that kind of bliss, 
Is only experienced by few: 
What trouble comes unto the door, 
Love flies, or else grows cold, 
And the only thing to warm it up is 
Gold, Gold, Gold!

We'd not set sail six weeks or more, 
When lor, the winds began to blow; 
For Mary Anne my heart felt sore, 
I 
wished myself at home with her in Pimnoo. 
The sea behaved uncommonly rough, 
To the gallant " Tirnbuctoo," 
And gave her a 
shock that sent her on a 
rook, 
All amongst the Chunkumchoo, 
'Mongst the horrid Chunkumchoo.

In nothing but top boots, feathers and paint,

Her husband I 
should be, 
But as she'd nine, I

Her making the tenth of me,

Rushed off to find my Mary Anne. 
I

loved, 
Also her children three; 
And her husband, oh lor! showed me the door, 
Said " there was no room for me." 
He " regretted" he'd no room for me.

Fond memory weaves a 
blissful dream, 
Of love and long ago; 
That hovers near me like a 
beam 
Of golden sunset glow. 
A 
dimpled hand is laid in mine, 
Blue eyes upon me gaze; 
And stars of heaven softly shine, 
As in sweet other days. 
And stars of heaven softly shine,

I 
hear a 
gentle voice repeat 
Affection's story still: 
So fall the hours or sad or sweet, 
My heart with rapture thrills. 
By 
leafy glade and tlow'ry dell, 
My heart in gladness strays; 
And recollection weaves a 
spell 
Of love and other days.

I 
know a 
youth with golden hair, 
And eyes that beam so bright, 
With happy face so sweet and fair, 
And heart so fond and light_ 
He's merry as the joyous birds, 
And says he loves me true; 
Yet I 
can scarce believe his words, 
Tell me, I 
pray, would you ? 
CHORLTS. 
I'm sure I 
love him very well, 
He says he loves me, too; 
Yet I 
can scarcely trust the spell, 
Tell me. I 
pray, would you? 
I 
know a 
maid so bright and fair, 
And sweet as she can be; 
With roguish eye and sunny hair, 
Such as you seldom see. 
She's merry as the laughing brook, 
I 
think she loves me, true; 
Yet I 
can scarcely trust her look, 
Tell me, I 
pray, would you? 
CHORUS. 
I 
know I 
love her more than all, 
And think she loves me, too; 
And soon to ask her I 
shall call, 
Tell me, I 
pray, would you ? 
I 
wish he'd call rue to his side, 
And whisper words of love; 
And call me all his joy and pride, 
His darling turtle dove. 
But, then, he never will do so, 
Although I 
love him true; 
I've half a 
mind to let him go, 
Tell me, I 
pray, would you? 
I'm sure I 
love him, etc. 
Come, tell me, sweetest little pet, 
You'll love no one but me. 
SHE. 
While life shall last, without regret, 
I 
give myself to thee. 
BOTH. 
And as we journey on through years, 
We ever shall be true; 
We'll never shed regretful tears, 
Tell me, I 
pray; would you ? 
CHORUS—BOTH. 
We're happy as two turtle doves, 
We love each other true; 
We'll ne'er regret the day we met, 
Tell me, I 
pray, would you? 
Originally sung by VAGINIA STICKNEY. 
Why do the men try to deny, 
They 'ovo that pretty girl, 
And then if they do pass her by, 
Just to give their eye a 
twirl; 
They cannot help it no they can't, 
I 
judge them by myself, 
For when I 
met that girl to-day, 
You know how it is yourself. 
Cnom:s. 
For oh, she was so handsome, 
And graceful as a 
fawn, 
How could I 
help but love that girl, 
With all those nice clothes on, 
And when she cast that smile on me, 
I 
knew that I 
was gone, 
For oh, she was so nobby, ha, ha, 
That pretty little blonde. 
I 
asked her if she'd walk with me, 
She smiled and answered yes, 
You should have seen me swell beside, 
That nobby, nice silk dress, - 
I 
asked her if she liked ice cream 
To cool her blushing tongue, 
flhe said she thought t 
would taste nice, 
With all those fine clothes on. 
For oh she was, Ize. 
QUEER sayings now are all the rage, 
We've new ones every day: 
Pve heard folks cry, " I'll have your hat!" 
And, " What will mother say!"

Which causes me much strife, 
'For whene'er I'm out the urchins shout—

But that's just what I

For she knows she's the Belle of Broadway, 
When she is in her prettiest dress'd ; 
Gents say that she is a

And fiirting's the fashion with Belles, 
But I

They can't talk to the Pet of the Swells!

Blasi° to be had of Wm. A. Pomo & Co., 547 Broadway. Pr4oe 80 es. 
High in my window two love-birds 
Hung in their cage for a 
summer long; 
Their passion had not the relief of words, 
And they did not appear to know a 
song: 
But there they nestled upon the perch, 
Beak to beak in a 
loveable way, 
Like two young lovers just fresh from church, 
And a 
look in their eyes that seemed to say— 
CHORUS. 
Hours go by • 
Let them fly • 
We'll mark them with a 
kiss. 
Hours go by * * * 
Let them fly * * • 
The time we pass in kissing, 
The time we pass in kissing 
Is time we never miss. 
My bird's example spread far and wide; 
There in the window they kiss'd and coo'd, 
'Till it soften'd the hearts of folks outside, 
And quite affected the neighborhood; 
And love grew in fashion more and yet more; 
All thro' the terrace flirtation so rag'd, 
That no one of twenty, few of two score, 
But was either just wed or else engaged. 
CHORUS. 
Kiss and coo 
I 
and you • 
Take our delight in this. 
Kiss and coo • 
I 
and you 
To share a 
perch together, 
To share a 
perch together, 
And kiss and kiss and kics 
lly aged Granny, a 
prim old dame, 
Was wholly perturb'd at their wooing ways: 
What forward things, I 
am 
with shame, 
No birds so acted in my young days, 
Their brazen imaiodesty pray disown, 
And send the creatures at once to roost; 
You ought to provide them a 
chaperone, 
And see them properly introduced. 
Chorus as before. 
At last came some one to see the birds; 
Somebody came, I 
won't tell who, 
But he begg'd them of me with pleading words; 
Ask'd for them and their mistress too: 
And some how, I 
and that foolish man, 
Tho' how it bappen'd I 
cannot swear, 
Agreed to follow the Love-bird's plan, 
Aucl make two couples instead of a 
pair.

gay dashing belle, 
As you are all aware, 
I 
love to dress and cut a

With me none can compare; 
I'm always cheerful, light and gay, 
My heart is never sad, 
I 
strive to cast dull care away, 
To keep my spirits glad. 
Oh! yes, I 
am a 
gay young belle, 
And well I 
love to cut a 
swell, 
Among the boys and girls as well, 
I'm call'd a 
female swell. 
As I 
walk down the crowded street, 
I 
toss my flowing curls, 
And smile on ev'ry gent I 
meet, 
I'm envied by the girls; 
The little dears, they are so shy, 
Their thot's they dare not tell, 
They are afraid to wink so sly, 
Like me, the female swell. 
Oh! yes, I 
am, &c. 
The other day I 
caught a 
beau, 
He offer'd me his arm, 
He talk'd so sweet. we walk'd so slow, 
He worship'd ev'ry charm;

Here by thy side, love, sadly I 
stand, 
Eager to feel the soft touch of your Land, 
Waiting to hear again thy sweet voice; 
Tender words breathing to make me rejoice; 
How have I 
suffered and wished I 
were dead, 
For those sad words that in anger I 
said; 
Oh, whisper you cherish for all, no regret, 
Say you forgive me, then kiss and forget,

Kiss and forget, love, each angry word; 
Speak but to tell me my pleading is heard; 
Kiss and forget love, each angry word; 
Speak but to tell me my pleading is heard: 
Why should your heart be repining yet? 
Say you forgive me, then kiss and forget. 
Why should your heart be repining yet? 
Say you forgive me, then kiss and forget. 
Smile on me, dearest, same as of old, 
Rest on my bosom thy tresses of gold;

Yet in my heart I 
have ever been true. 
Think of the past with no mournful regret, 
Say you forgive me, then kiss and Iorget. 
Kiss and forget, .Sc. 
Why did we ever wander apart. 
Filling with sorrow each happy young lynrt. 
Love's rosy pathway should know of no ter, 
Never a 
shadow of sorrowful fears. 
Life should be joyous to you and to me. 
Fair as the sunlight that kisses the sea. 
Let us go back to the day that we met, 
Banishing all as we kiss and forget.

lettimply Dumpty.—The areatest Trick book of the Age 
It pleases both old and young. It is the Fac-aimile of a 
trick practised 
by all the Professors of Magic. It is arranged so systematically, and if 
accompanied with directions so plainly written that, with a 
single po. 
rued, any person may become an adept in an unfailing source of 
amusement. Read what a 
leading Journal says of it: 
'Ann ingenious little book of the thattmaturgic order, has been Bent Ufa 
called 'HUMPTY DIIMPIT,' and bound in such a 
way as to give opporta. 
nity for a 
decidedly puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary ap. 
pearance of a 
child's picture book, gaily printed and colored, it is S. 
bound that a 
practised manipulator taking it up and flirting the learnt 
over, can make it appear to be filled only with one picture, or with blank 
pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of figures. 
One minute the 
pamphlet, quickly thumbed, appears to contain nothing but the portraii 
of Harlequin, in his tesselated suit • the next only Columbine, then 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or Mephistophiles. A 
little 
practice, and the directions printed with the book will make anybody 
at home in the handling of it."—PAa. Lee. Bua
