LG: 
Okay, today is August 28th, 2020; and my name is Lisa Gabbert, and today I am 
interviewing Dr. Ravi Ranjan here, at the University of Utah. And this is for the 
Physician’s Oral History project for the Library of Congress.  
 
 
Dr. Ranjan, you know you’re being recorded? 
 
Physician Oral History: Ravi Ranjan 
Page 2 
 
RR: 
Yes. 
 
LG: 
Okay. And for the record, can you please give me your birth year? 
 
RR: 
Nineteen-seventy-one. 
 
LG: 
Nineteen-seventy-one; thank you. 
 
 
Okay, to kick it off, can you start by telling me how you decided to become a doctor? 
 
RR: 
Yeah, it’s a little bit of an interesting journey, in the sense that I didn’t grow up in a 
family of physicians, or being exposed to much of healthcare. I always liked science; 
physics was my favorite subject. So, I actually ended up doing my undergrad in 
engineering (and it was electrical engineering). But I always liked biology and the 
functioning of the human body – it always intrigued me.  
 
 
So, while doing undergrad I had taken some biomedical engineering classes, which sort 
of exposed me a little bit more to medicine. And then I decided to do grad school in 
biomedical engineering, which sort of further exposed me to the world of medicine.  
 
 
And it’s interesting – I think it happens to be coincidence – the place where I did my PhD 
in biomedical engineering, we had to take the entire first year of medical school as 
exposure to the medicine side of biomedical. 
 
 
So, that really made me a bit more intrigued about the human body. Then I said, “Hmm, 
why not sort of do medicine?” And that’s when I started applying to medical school.  
 
 
So, it’s a little bit of a circuitous journey, because I came from the scientific side of 
things, and I was more intrigued about the functioning of the human body. And that’s 
how I got into medicine. And research and interest of how things work, and how to do 
better continues to be a big part of what I do.  
 
[02:02] 
 
LG: 
That is really interesting. And no physicians in your family? 
 
RR: 
So, my uncle was a physician, but he died an early death from kidney disease. And I 
think he passed away even before I was born, or shortly thereafter. So, I don’t have any 
memory of that; and no other person in medicine in my family.  
 
LG: 
And where did you grow up and go to college? 
 
RR: 
So, I grew up in India, and I did my undergrad in India, in one of the technology 
institutes called Indian Institute of Technology. And then I came over to the States to 
pursue grad school.  
 
Physician Oral History: Ravi Ranjan 
Page 3 
 
LG: 
And where did you complete your PhD? 
 
RR: 
At Johns Hopkins, in Baltimore. 
 
LG: 
And then can you talk a little bit about the process of applying to medical school, and 
what that was like? 
 
RR: 
Yeah; so, as I said – mine was not the traditional route of going to medical school. So, 
when I was doing grad school I decided I was going to pursue medicine, or at least apply. 
And that was an interesting process in itself, because (obviously) you had to meet course 
requirements and stuff, and doing a PhD (obviously) made a big difference in terms of – I 
guess I was different from the standard applicant pool [laughs].  
 
 
And so, the application and stuff was pretty routine. I mean, all universities have a pretty 
standard office that helps students who want to go to medical school. So, that was all 
pretty straightforward. 
 
 
Once I applied, interviews were interesting. Some places (most places) wanted in-person 
interview (now it’s a few years ago). I remember, so it’s been awhile back, so I’ll have to 
sort of dig a bit deeper into my memory. 
 
 
But the place that I ended up being, I had a great interview (obviously) because you can 
imagine, I ended up talking to my interviewer for a couple of hours. It was – obviously, 
we hit it off. We talked about lots of stuff, and I guess made some impression on him.  
 
LG: 
Nice. And where did you end up going to medical school? 
 
RR: 
So, I ended up going to medical school at Harvard, in Boston. 
 
LG: 
And what year did you enter? 
 
[04:01] 
 
RR: 
That was 1997. 
 
LG: 
Nineteen-ninety-seven. And was it a traditional four years? 
 
RR: 
So, a little bit of an interesting anecdote there as well – yes, traditionally it is four years; 
but I was at a Harvard/MIT joint program that’s called Health Sciences and Technology – 
more-so for people who are more quantitative and want to pursue (I guess) academic 
medicine more-so, in terms of research and stuff. And they have a mix of people who 
wanted to do the traditional four year; lots of them take additional time to do research or 
pursue other interests.  
 
 
So, I happened to take a year off (or at least do some research), but it ended up being 
working for a start-up in combination at MIT. 
Physician Oral History: Ravi Ranjan

LG: 
Okay. 
 
RR: 
So, it was a little bit of interesting aside of my academic journey. So, it was fun: it was a 
great experience; we were developing sort of voice-based applications and technologies. 
So, as you can imagine, this was – oh, December (year 2000, or so) – hand-held 
technology was just coming out. And there used to be this small hand-held (I’m 
forgetting the name of that particular device), but it had very little memory, and you 
could have a few of your contact information and stuff. Maybe it was called Palm –  
 
LG: 
Like a Palm Pilot? 
 
RR: 
Palm – yeah, so it was just before the Palm Pilot, just about when I was doing this the 
Palm Pilot had come out. And Palm Pilot, for the first time, had nice colored screen, had 
a little bit more computing power.  
 
 
So, we were like, “Oh, maybe we can use this to our advantage in the world of 
medicine,” and develop algorithms to help physicians keep track of their patients, their 
medication list. And as a physician, if you look at somebody’s medication list, that gives 
you some idea of what problems they have. So the idea was to develop algorithms – and 
this is where sort of the MIT connection came in.  
 
 
So use artificial intelligence (which is sort of a big buzz word these days). This was way 
back 20 years ago then, and we were trying to use it to identify what more could be and 
should be done for that particular patient, with the limited amount of information that was 
there on the Palm Pilot.  
 
[06:18] 
 
 
As you can imagine, now we are in the world where the entire sort of medical record 
exists on the computer, so you can really do extensive kinds of things with that 
information. But back then, the computing power of these things was rather limited.  
 
 
But as physicians then, even when you see that limited information, that gives you a lot 
of ideas about what that patient is about, and what can be done to make their sort of 
medical condition better, and improve their quality of life. So, that was the whole sort of 
project – that is how I got involved in it.  
 
 
Yeah, it was an interesting journey. I did it for a year, then it was time to get back to 
medical school and finish up this stuff. 
 
 
So, the long answer to your question, “Was it four years?” No, it was five years for me, 
because I ended up taking a year to do this kind of stuff. 
 
LG: 
What a unique opportunity, for sure. 
 
Physician Oral History: Ravi Ranjan 
Page 5 
 
RR: 
Yeah, it was a great experience. I mean, it was a start-up, and there were lots of people 
there. I learned quite a lot. 
 
LG: 
For people who don’t know, can you talk a little bit about your general medical school 
experience? Like what was that like? 
 
RR: 
Yeah. So, I mean – medical school is pretty traditional in most places, with some 
variations place to place. I mean, the first two years are sort of mostly in-class education, 
where you sort of get the theoretical knowledge. And then the last two years are mostly in 
hospital wards, when you are sort of going around learning from that sort of practical 
experience.  
 
 
And my experience was very similar. It was a little bit more quantitative (being sort of 
part of this program), and my background being in engineering was sort of a better fit for 
me. So, I really enjoyed that aspect of it. And as I was telling you earlier, I was always 
intrigued with the enormous complexity of the human body, even at a single cell level. 
And despite the complexity, how well it functions most of the time.  
 
 
 
Obviously, when it doesn’t function – that’s where sort of we come in as physicians; but 
the vast majority of time it works remarkably well. And that is what was amazingly 
intriguing to me – it was like, “This is incredible.” And that still sort of excites me and 
gets me to ask new questions, and sort of address these issues.  
 
[08:32] 
 
LG:  
What was the most difficult or challenging thing about medical school for you? 
 
RR: 
I mean, obviously, when you’re applying to medical school you have some sense of what 
it is to take care of patients, and people who are sick, and whatnot. But as you go through 
that journey, you do really see some people who are sick, and some even pass away – and 
that can be challenging, especially in the beginning.  
 
 
It can be a very humbling experience that despite you, or everybody else – despite all 
their best efforts, cannot every time save everybody. And especially when you’re doing 
in-hospital sort of rotations where people are sick, especially in ICU and whatnot. It can 
be challenging in the beginning; but obviously, there’s a system in place to help students 
deal with that and learn from it (some places better than others, I guess). 
 
 
But that was obviously a challenging experience; you learn from it. As I said, it’s 
sobering, it’s humbling –  
 
LG: 
Do you have a particular example that you’re thinking of? 
 
RR: 
I don’t have a particular example. I mean, maybe that’s one part of – at least learning for 
me – has been to sort of get a general sense of what it is like and how to deal with it, and 
Physician Oral History: Ravi Ranjan 
Page 6 
 
not sort of dwell in particular instances that leave some sort of scarred feeling in you. So, 
maybe those memories are suppressed down below [laughs]. 
 
 
But you learn how to deal with it. And as I said, when you are facing – for a med student, 
typically you are assigned a few patients that you take care of, that you are involved with 
from the beginning; and you continue to take care of them on daily basis (mostly you’re 
sort of managing their progression and helping the team in getting information and sort of 
checking on with the patient and stuff).  
 
 
And then when that person doesn’t do well it can be, as I said, a sobering experience. But 
you learn to live with it. 
 
[10:36] 
 
LG: 
So, for the general public, the most famous piece of medical school (of course) is gross 
anatomy – can you talk a little bit about your experience there? 
 
RR: 
Yeah. So, yeah – so, learning anatomy is obviously a big, integral part of medical school. 
And it’s an experience. Going in that room itself, where you’re doing the dissections can 
be challenging. It has obviously the smell of formalin or formaldehyde, and it does take 
some getting used to, the experience. 
 
 
But you focus on the deed that needs to happen. If you’re dissecting the arm, you just 
focus on dissecting the arm. You sort of narrow your vision, focus on what needs to be 
done, and move on instead of thinking more about that person.  
 
 
But in our case, at the end when everything was done we did get to know why that person 
died and whatnot; that sort of provided some closure as to what was happening to the 
person. And obviously, there are times when there is some pathology associated with that 
disease that also you come across, that provides some closure.  
 
 
But yeah; it’s a sobering experience. 
 
LG: 
And what was the best part (or one of the best parts) about medical school for you? 
 
RR: 
It was the comradery; I mean, I still remember – I mean, we were all in it together, taking 
care of people, going through this process. But we all really worked together. I still 
remember those rotations; I still remember times when we would be sort of in the middle 
of the night, dealing with some complex, difficult case where all of us (no matter where 
we were in the hospital) would get together, help each other out to do what needed to be 
done.  
 
 
And we were all there to support each other. And that sort of made it easier to deal with 
these bigger-than-one-person moments in taking care of people, that we could not have as 
one person.

[12:40] 
 
LG: 
Can you talk a little bit about your residency program – where you went –  
 
RR: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
And what it was like? 
 
RR: 
Yeah. So, I was at Mass General – so, I stayed in Boston for my internship and residency 
(it was residency in Internal Medicine). And again, it’s a great program, with obviously 
very dedicated, smart people in the residency program. It was (again) an experience that 
forces you to learn very quickly, humbles you, and at the same time provides an 
opportunity to help a lot of people. 
 
 
It was a difficult couple of years, in terms of work hours and whatnot; but at the same 
time, one of the most rewarding experiences of my life. I mean, essentially residency was 
essentially just thinking about the hospital and patients and going through rotations, with 
little time to do much on the outside. So you were completely consumed in that process; 
but also forced you to learn very quickly. That’s what I remember about that process. 
 
 
Obviously, every residency program is different in terms of how that training is 
structured. At Mass General, it was much more a resident-driven program: residents were 
sort of playing a very active role in taking care of patients. And that forced you to learn 
very quickly. And that sort of approach worked for some people; it wasn’t for everybody.  
 
 
And that sort of was a self-selected group of people who wanted to be residents there, 
who wanted to sort of do what needed to be done, make decisions. Obviously, there was 
supervision, there was appropriate level of supervision for us to sort of make sure we 
were doing the right thing.  
 
[14:45] 
 
 
And obviously, it’s a place where there are world-renowned experts in just about every 
field you can ask or think of. And they were easily accessible to take care of these 
patients. So, that (obviously) gave us that sort of additional advantage in knowing that we 
had the best minds for us to approach if there was an occasion to do so.  
 
 
But what I remember sort of distinctly of that experience was how it forced you to grow 
up quickly, make decisions to take care of patients.  
 
LG: 
Do you have a particular memory or story about residency that you’d like to share? 
 
RR: 
[Chuckles] Yeah; as I said (again), I still remember a few of the cases, especially some of 
the more difficult ones that sort of gets etched on your mind.  
 
Physician Oral History: Ravi Ranjan 
Page 8 
 
 
I remember of a case who (relatively) young person who had been through a few other 
local hospitals and was transferred in the middle of the night to our team. I was the – I 
want to say, it might be internship, or the junior (or the second-year) resident – I don’t 
remember at this point.  
 
 
But quite a sick person, and wasn’t completely clear what was wrong with that person. So 
it was challenging. And it took us a couple of days to really figure out what was 
happening. And the person had one of the rarer diseases of inflammation – that’s why it 
took a little bit longer, and perplexed a lot of other people. But that person stayed in the 
hospital for a few weeks, walked out of the hospital.  
 
 
And those are the kinds of stories that you remember, where you – it was essentially up to 
you. Obviously, the team was there, but you are the only person there in the middle of the 
night who knows the patient the most.  
 
[16:48] 
 
 
When a patient comes in, you talk to them, you get their story (as to what’s wrong with 
them). And maybe you spend an hour knowing everything about that patient. It’s 
challenging for the morning team to come and spend that much time; so, you are 
essentially the one getting all the information, and asking all the relevant questions, to try 
to figure out what is happening. So, you happen to know that person the best.  
 
 
And the way the system was structured then was that person continued to be your patient, 
and you were the advocate. Obviously, the whole team is there taking care of it with the 
attending. But since that was a little bit of an enigma in the beginning, I still remember 
doing lots of research, asking that person lots of relevant questions – going back and 
asking that person as to what was going on. And doing some very interesting diagnostic 
tests to figure out what was wrong.  
 
 
It happened to be one of the case reports in New England Journal of Medicine –  
 
LG: 
Wow – super rare. 
 
RR: 
It was a rare case, and that’s why it was – I still have memories of that particular patient. 
But as I said, at the end of the day he walked out of the hospital, which was hugely 
gratifying to the whole team. 
 
LG: 
And to him, I’m sure. 
 
RR: 
Oh, I’m sure. 
 
LG: 
[Laughs] 
 
RR: 
He was incredibly thankful to the whole team – the fact that we could figure out what he 
had, and to have the ability to help him. 
Physician Oral History: Ravi Ranjan 
Page 9 
 
 
LG: 
Yeah. 
 
RR: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
Yeah. Nice.  
 
 
Can you talk a little bit about the workload and the residency hours that you experienced 
then? Because that’s obviously one of the most competitive programs in the country. 
 
RR: 
Yeah. So, we were just going through this transition while I was in residency, of this 80-
hour work week. And traditionally, I guess people are called residents because they lived 
in the hospital (that’s what we were told) [laughs]. Obviously, that’s changing and we 
don’t live in the hospital anymore.  
 
 
But the ethos still was that you essentially did what you had to, to take care of the 
patients (irrespective of the hours you had spent). And that clearly has issues, and far 
from being ideal, in terms of people having any [chuckles] work-life balance, or life 
outside the hospital.  
 
[19:11] 
 
 
So, we were going through that transition, and sort of rules had been put in place for us to 
work no more than 80 hours. But I said, it was a little bit of a transition time. And a lot of 
it is also driven by, as I said, interns and residents who wanted to take care of their 
patients, and spend more time to get to know what is happening.  
 
 
So, it was an interesting time from that perspective. And as I see, that sort of system has 
evolved now into where there are a lot more shift hours, or shift-like – well-defined 
shifts, where people have fixed number of hours. And there’s lot of handing over of 
patient care and whatnot. And you can argue there are pluses and minuses (obviously) to 
both systems. But having said that, there obviously has to be well-defined sort of limits 
on number of hours you’re expected to work and what not.  
 
 
So, it was an interesting transition. And we (obviously) were part of that sort of transition 
team, as things were moving from just your patient, and you being in the hospital all the 
time, to this concept of teams and taking care of patients that way, so that physicians –  
 
LG: 
So, the team concept also evolved with the change of residency work hours? 
 
RR: 
Yeah. No, I mean there was always – there was a team, you were part of a team. But now 
it’s more so, just because one isn’t sort of spending all the time in the hospital. So, you 
are out of the hospital, and you are done, and somebody else is taking care of the patient. 
So, nobody is sort of calling you, “Okay, you need to do this,” or, “What happened with 
that patient?” Or, “What was going on?” So, more people are obviously involved in their 
Physician Oral History: Ravi Ranjan 
Page 10 
 
sort of well-defined systems in place, to sort of how to make that transition more 
effective, so that things aren’t dropped in the process, and whatnot. 
 
LG: 
Can you talk – do you need to go? 
 
RR: 
Yeah, can I? 
 
LG: 
Yeah, we can pause it. 
 
RR: 
Just pause for one second. 
 
[21:14] 
 
LG: 
Can you describe a little bit about what your call experience was like during that period? 
Do you remember? 
 
RR: 
Yeah. I think we used to do – I mean, we were doing 24-hour on-call (some rotations, 
obviously not all rotations). But when we were in-patient service, I think we used to do 
24 hours of call. And then the following day (after those 24 hours), we would do morning 
rounds.  
 
 
Our program was sort of the noontime: we used to have a noon conference, where there 
was an academic sort of lecture. And we used to get lunch – that used to be one way to 
draw everybody to that noon conference; obviously, you had to eat, and you got to learn 
something while you were eating – was one good way of making use of that time, and it 
forced everybody to come together.  
 
 
But the notion was that you would go home after that noon conference. But I remember, 
invariably there was more stuff that needed to be tied down or taken care of, and then we 
would stay a little bit longer, and then go home. So, I don’t think it ever was a full 36 
hours, but definitely somewhere between 30 and 36 hours of staying in the hospital, every 
fourth day (I want to say). 
 
LG: 
One in four? 
 
RR: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
And then what happens – how does one, after internal medicine residency, become a 
cardiologist? What’s the process there? 
 
RR: 
Yeah. So, the way the residency (or the training) is set up now, is you do med school, you 
do three years of internal medicine, and then you go into different sub-specialties 
(cardiology being one of them). And typically, cardiology is three more years of 
fellowship to become a general cardiologist.  
 
Physician Oral History: Ravi Ranjan 
Page 11 
 
 
And then there is further sub-specialty training within cardiology, if you want to further 
specialize in things (like electrophysiology, which is what I do). So, there’s two more 
years of training after cardiology. 
 
LG: 
And you say cardiology is three years? 
 
RR: 
Cardiology is three years. Yeah, so three years of internal medicine, three years of 
cardiology, and then one to two years of further training, depending on what sub-
specialty of cardiology you want to do. And not everybody is required to do further sub-
specialty in cardiology – you can be a general cardiologist and that’s three years. 
 
[23:41] 
 
LG: 
Okay. And where did you do your fellowship and sub-specialty, or specialty training? 
 
RR: 
Yeah, so I ended up going back to Johns Hopkins – I had done my PhD there in 
biomedical engineering (as we were talking about earlier). And as part of my PhD, I used 
to work closely in the cardiology department, because my research was cardiology 
related. So, my mentors and people whose lab that I worked in, they were still there in 
cardiology. So, I ended up going back to Johns Hopkins for my cardiology and 
electrophysiology training. 
 
LG: 
So, you did all five years there then? 
 
RR: 
I was there for five years. 
 
LG: 
Okay. And then how did you end up here, at the University of Utah? 
 
RR: 
Yeah, so I had no connections to the western part of the United States. As part of my 
training I had gotten interested in research work using MRI. So, this sort of gets a little 
bit into my day-to-day life of cardioelectrophysiologist, so I sort of call myself an 
electrician of the heart. So, I take care of electrical problems of the heart.  
 
 
And as part of my electrophysiology training, we would do regular procedures on patients 
who had electrical issues. And one of the big things that we take care of is atrial 
fibrillation, which is a relatively common arrhythmia, which happens in the upper 
chambers of the heart; and that can make people’s heart beat fast, and in an irregular 
fashion. And that can have varying consequences for people. Some are incredibly tired; 
some get light-headed, dizzy when their heart is racing. The other end of the spectrum is 
people who are not even aware that their heart is out of rhythm. 
 
 
So, obviously we take care of that. And the severity of that sort of varies a lot from 
person to person. And we do – there’s obviously a whole bunch of things we can do for 
this arrhythmia, but one of the things you do is a procedure called an ablation – where we 
put catheters into the heart, and cauterize a piece of the heart muscle where some of this 
irregular arrhythmia is coming from. 
Physician Oral History: Ravi Ranjan 
Page 12 
 
 
[25:56] 
 
 
And we would do this, and the procedure – when I was training – would be three to four 
hours, we would be sort of doing these procedures. And the procedure is good, but by no 
means perfect. And a lot of them would have a recurrence, and we would bring them 
back to the lab for these redo procedures. And we would wonder – while we were in that 
room for three-four hours, obviously, you thought about what was happening.  
 
 
And one of the things we would see is areas that we had cauterized would have 
restoration of electrical function. And when we say cautery, we essentially either heat the 
tissue or cool the tissue to kill the tissue. Mostly it’s heating, but cooling is also another 
way of doing it.  
 
 
So, we would have nice results in the case where we thought we had taken care of 
scarring the tissue. But when we would bring the same patient back, that area was not 
scarred. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
RR: 
And sort of would make (obviously) made us think as to what was happening. And I 
started doing some research work involving the use of MRI. So, MRI is a very nice 
imaging tool to look at soft tissue (as opposed to x-ray). And in an MRI, you can see lots 
of things that’s happening in the soft tissue. So, I started doing that research using a lot of 
MRI-based technology to look at what was happening at Hopkins. And Utah has a very 
strong MRI group, and the place had made some investments in that sort of technology. 
And that is sort of what lured me to come to Salt Lake. 
 
LG: 
I see. 
 
RR: 
And that’s –  
 
LG: 
That’s interesting. 
 
RR: 
Where I’ve been. Yeah. 
 
LG: 
And how long have you been here? 
 
RR: 
Ten years now.  
 
LG: 
And what’s your current title or position? 
 
RR: 
So, I’m associate professor in medicine, in cardiology. And I’m also the director of the 
electrophysiology lab – sort of managing sort of the day-to-day functioning of the 
electrophysiology labs.  
 
Physician Oral History: Ravi Ranjan 
Page 13 
 
[28:01] 
 
 
And I also spend half my time doing academic/research work. I have grants from NIH 
and the American Heart Association where we – the goal is, again, to understand 
arrhythmias, how to sort of take better care of these patients, develop new techniques to 
treat them. So, I have a research lab comprising students: PhD students, post-doctoral 
fellows, technicians – where we sort of explore different things, in terms of 
understanding these arrhythmia mechanisms, understanding the pathophysiology (or how 
sort of this disease progresses) so that we can develop better techniques to take care of 
these patients.  
 
LG: 
And which parts of your job do you like best? Because you have different kinds of jobs 
here in your position. 
 
RR: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
Different things that you do. 
 
RR: 
Yeah. It’s interesting in the sense that I wear different hats: obviously I take care of 
patients, I have clinic – I see them in clinic; we do procedures as needed in these patients; 
there’s a little bit of administrative duties and research.  
 
 
I find that having a mix of both of them helps me—meaning, obviously when I take care 
of patients the goal is to sort of do the best for that patient, to help that patient. But it also 
lets me ask questions that gets into what we can do better in general for everybody like 
that. And that is a daily process where I see certain things working, certain things that 
need improvement, certain things not working.  
 
[30:01] 
 
 
And that allows me to take those questions to the research side, where we can investigate 
some of those in much more detail. And if there are ideas to try something new, it 
provides a place to explore those things in more detail.  
 
 
So, I go back and forth. And I find that to be highly stimulating for me. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
RR: 
There are times when research – the whole idea of research is obviously not everything 
that you want to do works, right? I mean, there are frustrations; there are days when you 
feel like, “Hmm, nothing is working.” At that point, I’m like, “Okay, I’m going to go take 
care of patients.” You know? I mean, that sort of provides the –  
 
LG: 
Concrete thing— 
 
Physician Oral History: Ravi Ranjan 
Page 14 
 
RR: 
Yeah. At the end of the day you help somebody, and it provides the necessary, uplifting 
sort of emotion that you need to go back to the lab and, “Okay, let’s start again. Let’s see 
what worked. Why didn’t work?”  
 
 
And vice versa. There are times where difficult cases -  you have done just about 
everything you could and nothing is working your way.  
 
 
So, going back and forth I find to be very stimulating – not just from an intellectual 
curiosity or standpoint, but also to [laughing] escape when something isn’t working on 
one side. 
 
LG: 
It provides balance. 
 
RR: 
It provides very necessary balance in my mind, to move from that sort of frustrating 
moment to the other side; that sort of provides the necessary needed upliftment to move 
on. 
 
LG: 
Nice. 
 
RR: 
Yeah. And it’s not like I cannot do one or the other – I mean, if I had to just do patient 
care, I would thoroughly enjoy it – I enjoy that side of my work, I enjoy the research side 
of it. But if I were just doing sick cases – I mean, if I did 500 of them, I don’t know how 
intellectually stimulating I would find it: to do the same thing over and over again.  
 
[31:59] 
 
 
So, having that sort of escape, where I can now do something different: I can think 
differently – at least I find it to be very stimulating.  
 
LG: 
That makes sense. 
 
 
For people who don’t really understand, can you talk about what it really means to be 
responsible for a patient and for patient care? 
 
RR: 
Yeah; no, I mean it’s a huge responsibility – and I guess that’s why you have this long 
training to take you where you get there.  
 
 
Obviously, when we see patients with a particular problem there are some that are – in 
my field, there are some that are highly elective, in the sense that there’s this disease 
entity called SVT: it stands for supraventricular tachycardia where in people that 
completely structural normal hearts, their heart can race at very high rates of 150-200 
beats a minute.  
 
 
And it happens in people of all ages: it happens in kids, it happens in people who are 70 
years old. It is not life-threatening; it’s not something that you die from. But as you can 
Physician Oral History: Ravi Ranjan 
Page 15 
 
imagine, if you’re sitting there and all of a sudden your heart starts to race with 170 beats 
a minute, it is not a comforting feeling.  
 
 
So, the treatment for that is: one, is you can say, “Do nothing, you’re not dying from it. 
It’s uncomfortable, but you’ll live with it.” We can give medications, and we can do a 
procedure where we can go in the heart, figure out where this arrhythmia is coming from, 
and then cauterize that piece of tissue. And over the years, that procedure has gotten to be 
so good that the chance of it being successful in patients is 90-95%. And once you have 
gone through this procedure, you’re cured for life – I mean, it really is gone with such a 
high success rate (like I said, 90-95%). And you live a completely normal life after that.  
 
[34:02] 
 
 
So, as you are talking to a patient who has had this, you have to understand, in that 
moment of discussion, as to what the patient wants. Everybody is different; not 
everybody wants the procedure, and not everybody – because there are risks. I mean, 
obviously these are invasive procedures.  
 
 
And even though the procedure works remarkably well, with a great success rate – there 
are complications that can happen. And granted, over the years we’ve gotten so good at 
this that the rate of complications is very small. But even if it is half a percent, if you do 
enough of these cases, one in 200 is going to have a complication. So that needs to be 
balanced, and that needs to be conveyed to the patient.  
 
 
And it’s not unusual – well obviously, most patients have some sense of what they want. 
And we sort of tailor make the decision to what’s the requirement of the patient. But it’s 
not unusual for patients to say, “What do you recommend?” Or, “What would you do if it 
was you?” Right? I mean, that can be a difficult question to answer. I mean, essentially 
the patient is asking you to make a decision for them.  
 
 
I try to give them all the facts and help them towards making a decision that they’re 
comfortable with. So, that (obviously) is a sense of responsibility that I feel I have, to 
give them all the information: the pros and the cons, and help them get to a decision that 
they are going to be comfortable with – even if they happen to be that unlucky half a 
percent who has a problem, so that they are comfortable with that decision.  
 
 
And having said that – so, if they do decide to go with the procedure, that’s the procedure 
I do. And there is this huge sense in my mind that they are trusting you to do this. So, 
there is a sense of responsibility that you have to make sure you do the best you can for 
that patient, and make sure they have a good outcome.  
 
[36:18] 
 
 
Yes, theoretically, we all want that to happen every time, but I feel like the patient is 
entrusting you to do this – and again, this is not unique to my field: all of medicine is 
essentially taking care of people and patients trusting you to do the right thing. 
Physician Oral History: Ravi Ranjan 
Page 16 
 
 
 
So, I think you have a sense of responsibility to do what is optimal and best, given the 
knowledge and the circumstances of that patient.  
 
 
So, that (I think) makes you mature, do the right thing for the patient. And that might not 
be obvious – it is obvious most of the time, but there are times you could go either way: 
you could make a decision one way or the other. And those are the ones where I think 
that added sense of responsibility makes you think harder, to figure out what that patient 
would want to do. 
 
 
It’s a little bit easier when there is sort of a life and death situation, right? I mean, 
obviously you will do everything to keep the patient alive and going. And if it’s clear-cut, 
then in my mind, even though the decisions might involve a big procedure, but can be 
straightforward: you know what needs to happen.  
 
 
But when it’s not so clear, and it is a decision where you could do lots of different things, 
I think you need to step back and think a bit more, and sort of makes you sort of think a 
bit harder.  
 
LG: 
How did you learn to kind of handle that weight of responsibility over the course of your 
training? 
 
RR: 
Yeah. I think as long as the guiding principle is to do what is best for the patient, I think 
then you’re okay. 
 
[38:16] 
 
 
There are lots of distractions for a physician – you have to see certain patients, you have 
to generate certain revenue, you have to do certain things. And that’s (obviously) 
understandable from a system standpoint: the hospital has to make money to survive, and 
things need to happen. 
 
 
But I think as long as (at least for me, I can say) the guiding principle has been to do what 
is the best for the patient, even though that might not be say, the most lucrative; it might 
not be the most expensive, it might not be the shortest, it might not be the most optimal 
use of your time.  
 
 
But I think if you’re doing with that fundamental endpoint, then I don’t have a problem 
with the decisions I make, no matter how it goes. So, that’s how sort of I have sort of 
grown into that responsibility. And I think it takes a little bit of time to get there. As I 
said, there are lots of pressures to produce, and be productive; and obviously, there are 
markers for productivity, and that needs to be quantified, and it’s perfectly legit.  
 
 
But if the overarching goal is to do the right thing, even though that might not be the 
most financially rewarding – I think everybody understands that. And I am very 
comfortable with that, and I think that is what I bring to the table for my patients.  
Physician Oral History: Ravi Ranjan 
Page 17 
 
 
LG: 
That makes sense. So, kind of a grounding with the decision-making process? 
 
RR: 
Yeah. Yes – no,  I mean that’s a nice way to put it. I mean, that to me, as long as that is 
the overarching and ultimate goal, and you move towards that goal – I think I feel very 
comfortable with the decisions I make, as does everybody else, or nobody is going to 
come and say, “Why did you not do something else?” And as long as I have a good 
explanation, I think everybody is happy and nobody can say sort of, “No, we should have 
done something else.” 
 
[40:45] 
 
 
There are obviously situations where there isn’t one perfect answer; and that’s where 
your sort of experience of taking care of patients for some years, and having some gray 
hair (I guess) helps. Then you can say, “Yeah, in my opinion that was the right thing to 
do.” 
 
LG: 
Let’s see – how has being a doctor changed you as a person? 
 
RR: 
I think you’ll have to ask people around me that question better, I guess. But I think 
having more empathy becomes part of you, to some extent. I mean, you are obviously 
taking care of people; and helping becomes part of what you are. The idea is to make 
people feel better.  
 
 
So, I think that changes you to some extent. It can also change you in a bad way: you 
start thinking you are the only one who can do this. And as long as you realize that 
everybody is fully replaceable, and there are lots of others who can do something just as 
good (if not better), then I think it makes you realize that okay, you’re there to help. And 
as long as that’s the mission, you feel good about it. And that’s how I feel it has changed 
me.  
 
 
I mean, when you are doing other scientific pursuits, you might lose sight of what the end 
goal is: is to take care of patients at the end of the day. And you could get carried away 
doing things; but I think for me (at the end of the day), that grounds me: that that is sort 
of the purpose, of at least my professional life. And I suspect maybe that carries over to 
other things that I do.  
 
[43:00] 
 
LG: 
Well doctors are pretty well-known for their sense of humor. Can you talk a little bit 
about what role (if any) humor plays in your own work? 
 
RR: 
Yeah.  
 
LG: 
It’s sort of a stereotype of the profession.  
 
Physician Oral History: Ravi Ranjan 
Page 18 
 
RR: 
Yeah, I guess. So, obviously there’s a huge spectrum, right? I mean, as in any field there 
are sort of stereotypes, and there is reality.  
 
 
Obviously, being funny and humorous is sort of an individual trait more than anything 
else. But you have to have these moments where you can laugh about things, otherwise 
life would be difficult taking care of serious stuff all the time. So, sort of everybody does 
it sort of in their own way. 
 
 
As I was telling you, our procedures tend to be a little bit on the longer side – they can be 
two to three hours when we are sort of in the lab taking care of stuff. And there’s 
obviously a team that is there in the lab, taking care of the patient. And we banter and we 
sort of joke around things; it provides lighter moments when things are going well, and 
things are going smoothly – thankfully which is, by far, most of the time.  
 
 
We do banter and joke around and sort of poke fun at each other. And that makes those 
two-three hours go very quickly, and everybody has a good experience. And at the end of 
the day we’re like, “Oh, that was a good day.” We sort of accomplished certain things, 
and we laughed a little bit, so it works out great. 
 
LG: 
Are there any cardiologist jokes that you know of? 
 
RR: 
I’m sure there are –  
 
[Laughter] 
 
 
I’m not the one who sort of tells lots of jokes, so I don’t have a good memory. I 
remember there was a colleague of ours here, who really – every time you met him he 
would tell you a few jokes (I don’t remember right now, off the top of my head). But 
obviously, there is a huge spectrum of people –  
 
LG: 
Yeah. 
 
[45:00] 
 
RR: 
 But that was how he was known. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
RR: 
Every time you met him it was like, oh – he would ask you something or tell you a joke. 
And he was sort of known to be that kind of person. 
 
LG: 
Right. 
 
 
The other aspect of doctoring that I am interested in is the question of suffering and 
whether or not the act of taking care of sick people can affect physicians and cause them 
to suffer; I was wondering if you might comment on that a little bit?  
Physician Oral History: Ravi Ranjan 
Page 19 
 
 
RR: 
Yeah. No, it’s obviously a real and serious issue. I think as you go through the training 
process, I think it prepares you for those things. Obviously, we are in a profession where 
people do get sick, some people die. It varies a lot from your specialty to specialty. So, 
the degree of what you see in terms of suffering and death is hugely variable (of course), 
depending on what you do.  
 
 
In cardiology, we do take care of a lot of sick people. Electrophysiology (what I do) tends 
to be a big spectrum; the vast majority of what we do is people who are not that sick, but 
at the same time we take care of certain diseases where people are quite sick. And you do 
lose some people, despite your best efforts.  
 
 
And one aspect of my profession is sort of seeing some of these patients over many years, 
how they have sort of – most of them do remarkably well, some of them don’t. And 
taking them through the process, and helping guide them. You do get to know some 
patients really, really well, and you develop a relationship with them. And to lose them 
can be challenging. I mean it obviously forces you to stop and think.  
 
[47:30] 
 
 
But I think there’s enough of a support and understanding that you learn from it, you 
grow from it, and do better for the next person – not just in terms of medical care, but sort 
of preparing them, their family, preparing yourself for that outcome, if that is to be 
expected.  
 
 
And I think that is what sort of keeps you going, sort of you know (in certain cases) that 
despite the best efforts, people will die.  
 
 
But I think as long as you understand it, as long as everybody comes to that 
understanding I think it’s easier for everybody. There are clearly certain cases where 
people are not ready to understand what is happening, or they don’t want to – maybe not 
don’t want to, but at least do not appreciate the seriousness of their illness; and then it’s 
obviously a bit more challenging for everybody if something bad happens.  
 
 
But I think it’s a process. And I think that process makes you deal with it as you face 
these eventualities.  
 
 
As I was saying, every specialty is different. I think specialties where you take care of 
such sick people (cardiology being one of them), it also humbles you. I mean, you are 
humbled by, despite all technology and everything we can do today, we still lose people: 
people still have their organs fail. And despite technology being what it is, we still have 
more work to do.  
 
[49:55] 
 
Physician Oral History: Ravi Ranjan 
Page 20 
 
 
And that also, in certain cases, sort of makes you think and ask more questions to figure 
out what more needs to happen, as we sort of deal with these disease entities.  
 
LG: 
What advice would you have for people who are thinking about going to medical school 
today? What kinds of things would you want to tell? 
 
RR: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
Prospective students? 
 
RR: 
Yeah. I mean, I have students in my research lab, both some were in medical school, 
some before medical school, some who are thinking about medical school. And I’ve had 
multiple discussions. And what I tell people who want to be physicians is do this for the 
right reasons.  
 
 
Meaning, it is a long journey: lots of school, lots of training; there will be difficult 
moments where you will face situations that will make things difficult, in terms of either 
a difficult situation, in terms of a patient not doing well. There will be long hours. And 
it’s a very long journey. So, do it for the right reasons. Meaning, if you really want to do 
this.  
 
 
There are some people who really enjoy this, in the sense that the ability to take care of 
others and help them makes a big difference to them. And if that is the motivation, then 
dealing with the long hours, the school, the difficult moments – it’s just part of the 
process and it’s not overwhelming to you. 
 
[52:00] 
 
 
But if you got in for the wrong reasons – you just thought being a doctor is sort of some 
nice thing to do, and you’re not in it for the right reasons – then life can be very 
challenging and difficult.  
 
 
And there are people who obviously (a very small minority of it) – people who change 
courses as they are going through med school or training, and they do realize it is not for 
them, and they sort of move on to do other things.  
 
 
But I think as long as people go in with a very clear-eyed notion of what they are getting 
into, and if that is what they want to do – I think people have a very rewarding 
experience. I find myself to be very lucky in that position: that I do something that I find 
to be hugely rewarding.  
 
 
I feel very satisfied with what I do on a daily basis, both in terms of taking care of 
patients, on the research side – I find myself to be in great sort of privileged position of 
feeling very satisfied. There’s a purpose to everything I do every day, and it sort of 
getting up in the morning, getting out of bed has a huge sense of purpose. I really feel 
Physician Oral History: Ravi Ranjan 
Page 21 
 
great about it, “Okay, this is what I’m going to do today.” It’s very rewarding at the end 
of the day. 
 
LG: 
Nice.  
 
 
Well I’m kind of done with my questions. So, is there anything else that you feel is 
important for the general public to know about either doctoring (generally), or being a 
cardiologist (specifically), that you would want to share? 
 
RR: 
There are an incredible number of TV shows out there put out what physicians do 
[laughing]. 
 
LG: 
Yeah. 
 
RR: 
Some of it glorified and far from reality. 
 
[53:57] 
 
 
The only thing I would say is it’s a journey. We work together with patients, in terms of 
taking care of them. It’s an honest dialogue of what we know about certain things, what 
we can do about certain things, what we cannot do about certain things. And as long as 
the patient is open to the dialogue process, it’s a rewarding experience for everybody.  
 
 
But if the expectations are that you walk in and all of a sudden with some magic wand, 
things will be taken care of – then it leads to sort of people feeling a bit bitter and 
unhappy.  
 
 
But I think most people (obviously) have a very realistic expectation of what they want or 
get out of from their physician. And that is what sort of on a day-to-day basis makes it a 
very rewarding experience for me, and hopefully also for most of my patients – that they 
feel satisfied at the end of the day after a visit or procedure, that they feel their issues 
were taken care of and they find that we did something to help them.  
 
LG: 
My conclusion from doing a lot of these interviews is it sounds like an incredibly 
rewarding and incredibly difficult profession.  
 
RR: 
Yeah. No, I mean if you look from outside, some of the things we do is crazy, right? I 
mean, it’s just mind-boggling to think what we do, yet we’ve been able to do this only 
because people have thought about this for long periods of time and have come up with a 
process – a lot of it by trial and error, I might add – as to what works and what doesn’t.  
 
 
And that is – I mean, I am amazed by (as I was sort of telling you in the beginning) – I’m 
amazed by the complexity of some of the things that the human body does; and yet, it 
works so well most of the time.  
 
[56:16] 
Physician Oral History: Ravi Ranjan 
Page 22 
 
 
 
And what we do in terms of procedures – some of the procedures have become incredibly 
complex, and yet they do work quite well most of the time. And that’s (again) because of 
all that people have done over the years to fine-tune it. And when things don’t work, 
things just fall apart so rapidly; and the results can be catastrophic only tells you that 
there is a lot to be said about the process that goes into working out every fine detail to 
make sure it works.  
 
 
I mean, it makes me think of say, flying airplanes. I mean, it’s sort of a metal tube that 
flies at 500 miles an hour at 30,000 feet. I mean, if you think of what it took to get there, 
and in not a long time. I mean, we went from the first flight, to now planes being safer 
than any mode of travel. And if you think of it, it’s essentially a metal tube flying. So, 
obviously a lot has gone into it to make it safe, despite the process being so remarkably 
complex. 
 
 
And sort of similarly to what we do, I look at it as complex procedures; but as long as 
things are thought through and done in a meticulous way, it makes a big difference. And 
we will obviously continue to do better, in terms of taking care of people.  
 
LG: 
Is there anything else you would like to add? 
 
 
Alright. Well thank you very much for doing this interview.  
 
 
Again, my name is Lisa Gabbert. Today is August 28th, 2020, and I’m talking to Dr. Ravi 
Ranjan, here at the University of Utah. 
 
 
Thank you so much.  
 
RR: 
Thank you, Lisa; thank you for your time.
