Interview Log: afc2015027_03420_ms03  
 
00:00:00   Pat Francois introduces herself and the project.  Valerie Murray currently works as a 
senior care provider, working with a patient in the second stages of Alzheimer’s.  She gets 
private cases by word of mouth. 
 
00:01:00  Getting jobs through agencies.  She did an Alzheimer’s Association course.  Private 
cases pay better.  
 
00:02:30  She gets paid $30 an hour, whereas through an agency they keep $20, given you ten, 
and tax it.  She lives in King’s County, originally from Trinidad and Tobago.  How she got into 
domestic work.  Worked in a bakery and a customer told her about Domestic Workers United. 
  
00:05:30  Various jobs she has had, one babysitting, mostly with elderly.  In the babysitting job 
there was tension around the child calling her Mommy. 
 
00:07:00   She retained relationship with this boy.  Now tenth grade. 
 
00:08:00   Valerie describes a typical day doing elder care.  Her biggest elder care job was with 
two patients in Manhattan.  She had total responsibility.  She had to pay rent, bills, buy groceries 
and personal items.  They ran out of money.  Worked for three weeks without pay.  No need to 
go to foreign countries for charity work, it was right there.  Signed them up for Medicaid.  
 
00:10:00   How patients were in denial about running out of money and she had to leave because 
she wasn’t getting paid. 
 
00:10:30   Difficulty of signing them up for Medicaid.  She cried.  They were helpless.  They 
finally got help from the government.    
 
00:11:00   Apartment was being sold while they were there but new owner agreed to let them 
finish their lives there.  Even now Valerie still pays the man’s telephone bill.  He is still on her 
account for his cell phone.   
 
00:12:30   They were “the worst people” before they ran out of money.  The work was 
sometimes 24 hours.  
 
00:13:30   She became their manager. 
 
00:14:00   Skills for domestic work, working with Alzheimer’s patients requires communication 
skills.  Regular elderly like to talk.  You learn their life story. Special skills for bedridden 
patients.  
 
00:17:00   Sociology might be helpful for people to deal properly with the elderly.  You have to 
be a people person.  Usefulness of training, especially CPR, can save a life.

00:19:00   How her patient was hospitalized because he fell down.  Danger of bruising when 
blood doesn’t clot properly.  Herbal remedies and eating right are important.  Importance of 
protein and iron.  She pureed food for her client.  
 
Day by day he ate a bit more after getting out of hospital.  Gradually she added more foods to his 
diet.  Used coconut oil on him. 00:22:00  Made sure her client took his medications.  He regained 
his strength and is still alive today, four years after that hospitalization.  Domestic work is real 
work if you take it to heart.  
 
00:23:00  She expects to be treated nicely.  She treated him well and he was not obnoxious to her 
as he was to other workers. 
 
00:24:00  Ways to help elderly fall asleep.  Be quiet, put TV on, leave them alone, they will doze 
off.  
 
00:25:00  How talking about his mother calms him down.  Remedies she uses:  coconut oil and 
turmeric.  Turmeric has helped his wife with sciatica.  You can add it to eggs, tea, oats.  
 
00:27:00  More skills for elder care.  Making sure patient is not on a wet bed, to avoid bed sores. 
 
00:27:30   Best part of the job. Being trusted, and not watched like a thief, so she felt at home.  
 
00:28:00   Worst part of the job.  Patient screaming and cursing at the other workers.  He made 
his first three million at 23, and the next minute could barely buy a loaf of bread.  That can be 
frustrating.  It was not dementia. 
 
00:29:30   Current job, the gentleman has Alzheimer's.  He and his wife are respectful and they 
trust her. 
 
00:30:00   Wife trusts her enough to leave her credit card with her to buy food.  Another job she 
had in Mount Vernon.  They went to the Hamptons and wanted her to come but she didn’t want 
to go there.  That was a memorable job.  Knowing when to talk and when to be quiet.  Difficulty 
of working with some of the client’s relatives.  Sometimes there is jealousy over the role of the 
caregiver. 00:33:00   How one day her client called bank and suggested they give Valerie power 
of attorney.  She talked him out of this, to give it to a family member.   
 
00:34:00  Work and holidays:  Valerie didn’t take holidays.  Only took sick time off.  At first she 
worked seven days a week.  She had to cut down.  
 
00:35:00   She and another woman were threatened due to their immigration status.  Her friend 
from DWU reassured her. 
 
00:37:30   Personal and work life balance, how does Valerie do this?  The work breaks the 
mother child bond unless you bring the child with you.  She started domestic work when her son 
was older.  She managed to be there when he was home from school and was there to help him

with his homework, so there was balance. 
 
00:39:00   Women who work long hours have to worry about where their children are.  
 
00:39:30  Getting phonecalls that a son is trouble and being stuck at the job, especially hard for 
single parents.  
 
00:40:30   Young children need their parents there.  Her being there for her son paid off.  He 
never got in trouble.  He is 22 now. 
 
00:41:00   Valerie only belongs to DWU, no other organizations.  Feels she belongs at DWU 
meetings.  
 
00:42:30   She tried to be there for her son in high school as well, not going here and there, 
elsewhere. 
 
00:43:00   Now that he is busy with his life she is making use of this time.  The Bill of Rights is 
good because it’s scary not to know you have rights.  
 
00:43:30   Valeries shares a story of a worker whose employer came to an event at her house, 
decided she had too nice a lifestyle, and fired her.  This is why DWU is important. 
 
00:45:00   She respects DWU for letting people know they have rights.  That situation was a 
form of discrimination, an employer deciding an employee had too nice a home.  This woman 
did not know about DWU. 
 
00:46:30   Valerie would like to see the Bill of Rights being enforced more, sick days, real 
vacation time, not everyone gets these.  People are still threatened with firings.  DWU is the only 
group standing up for domestic workers. 
 
00:47:30   Without DWU the bill would not be in place.  The bill is not really being enforced.  
People still treated unjustly.  Pat provides examples of the low wages she has been offered, such 
as $5 an hour.  Importance of not working under minimum wage.  
 
00:50:00   Women take it because they have to pay rent and bills, and feed their children.  
Women take what they can get.  How employers don’t view workers as real people with real 
lives.  Sharing stories makes workers stronger. 
 
00:51:30   What skills would Valerie like to gain:  sociology, to deal better with people.  DWU 
taught Valerie to stand up for herself. 
 
00:52:30   People can feel less alone and less subject to abuse, that’s what it gave Valerie.  DWU 
is a refuge.  
 
00:53:00   Parting words:  Valerie would like to know that the dream of DWU will live on, that 
more people find out about it, it becomes more widespread, a household name, like a brand

name, that domestic workers can always turn to to make their lives easier.  
 
00:54:00   If people know they can lean on DWU, their lives will be easier. 
 
00:54:30   What Valerie has learned from the elderly:  many lessons, but mainly that money does 
not bring happiness or peace.  Being a good person and being spiritual brings peace.  Being at 
peace with yourself, loving yourself, and being as good a person as you can be are most 
important. 
 
00:56:00   Pat thanks and commends Valerie for her work.
