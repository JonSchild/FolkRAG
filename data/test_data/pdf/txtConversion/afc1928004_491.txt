Our Stage-Struck Daughter. 
Written by JOHN SHEEHAN, and sung by SHEEHAN and Jorms with great 
success at Tony Pastor's. 
Pat MeMonaghan, that is my name, 
And I 
have lately crossed the water; 
My heart it is completely broke, 
For I 
have a 
stage-struck daughter. 
She says she supports Edwin Boots, or Shoes, 
Mary Anderson whit her lays low; 
Then thousand dollars is the salary she does ask, 
Or to the theatre she won't go. 
CHORUS. 
She has her mother's heart near broke, 
Whit play-acting she is crazy; 
Her mother wanted her to be a 
servant girl, 
But for work she was too lazy. 
She calls herself the leading lady 
In the Ballet or Can-Can; 
She is a 
perfect masher, and 
She broke upon the leading man. 
As a 
slack-wire dancer she is great, 
She plays the villian's part ; 
In the character of Juliet 
She broke poor Romeo's heart.

If I 
was an Alderman. 
Written by JonN SHEEHAN, and sung with great success by SurssAmi-
and JONES in their original sketch entitled " Duffy's Lane." 
If I 
was an alderman in this great glorious land, 
To help the workingman I'd make people understand 
That I 
would be the first to holler about the thieving silver 
dollar, 
And all who kicked should get the collar. 
If I" was an alder-
man, 
The East River Bridge should be done, and elevated roads 
be run 
For five cent fares, to help the workingman. 
Then I'd have a 
great big say about all sinectirists' pay, 
Who work but two hours a 
day, if I 
was an alderman. 
And then I'd help the poor who are starving by the score, 
They should never beg no more—I 
would have an open door. 
Two good gold dollars a 
day should be the laborer's pay, 
That's what I'd surely say if I 
was an alderman. 
I 
should make a 
liquor law that would never be a 
bore, 
And not favor one particular clique or clan; 
Put insurance thieves in jail, and have no one to go their bail, 
Up the river they should sail, if I 
was an alderman. 
I 
would look for all the cranks who burst our savings banks, 
Then drown them all in tanks and gain the people's thanks. 
I'd hang Henry Ward Beecher, the notorious Brooklyn 
screecher 
And famous free-love teacher, if I 
was an alderman. 
Then I'd bring ould Ireland here, who is to my heart so dear, 
And not let England make slaves of the Irishmen. 
The red, white and blue and green together should be seen; 
No one should go between if I 
was an alderman.

That Son of Mine. 
Written for SnamtaN and JoNes by BEN. H. 
BENTON. 
I 
sing to you of my darling son, whose maiden name is Billy, 
He wears a 
great big stand-up collar that he calls a 
Picadilly. 
He travels on the Avenue in a 
style that you'd call grand, 
He talks a 
sort of lingo, and swears by jumping jingo, in a 
way you wouldn't understand. 
CHORUS. 
He's President of the Nimble Five, 
And his gang call him their god, 
And say they'll make him Alderman, 
To represent their ward; 
Whenever his club give their ball, 'tis then my- darling's 
dressed, 
With his choker collar and patent leather shine, his clothes 
are of the best; 
And, with his girl upon his arm, he's sure to lead the march, 
With a 
bill of fare pinned to his coat, he marches as stiff as 
starch. 
He's President, &c. 
When he comes home from work at night, he goes down to 
Harry Hill's, 
'An when there's to be an exhibition there, his name's in big 
letters on the bills; 
He generally sets-to with the Mouse, says he makes a 
rattler 
with young Kelly, 
But when I 
put the mits on with him, he hits me a 
whack in 
the belly. 
He's President, &c. 
He steals his mother's underclothes, to give to an Irish fairy, 
And, to keep himself in practice, wrestles with his sister Mary; 
He feeds his bull-dog chicken pie—when his mother kicks, 
he'll choke her; 
He puts my Sunday clothes in pawn, for money to play poker. 
He's President, &c. 
When I 
say to him, " Now, Billy, dear, do not be such a 
dandy," 
He says I'd better take an hour, and not be giving him candy. 
God knows what has come over him—he's cracked, as I'm alive, 
He's broke my poor old heart in two since he joined the 
Nimble Five, 
He's President, &c.

I 
Havn't an Equal. 
Written by CHAS. DOCKSTADER for SHEEHAN and JoNaa. 
Oh some facts I 
am now going to tell ye's, 
And of course I'll enlighten your minds, 
Whin you've heard all me discourse this evening, 
Faith I 
hope you's won't turn away blind, 
I'm a 
great politician and statesman likewise; 
I 
could greatest improvements invent. 
Then form strong resolutions widout desolutions, 
And make me your next President. 
CHORUS. 
I 
am courted be young girls and ladies, 
They're in love wid me style and me grace, 
Ah, me figure and form are intrancing; 
Don't you think I've an ilegant face ? 
Well, I'm Irish, and I 
knows you's don't think it, 
For of course ye's all thought I 
was Frinch; 
I've the greatest respect for officials, 
From a 
policeman till the judge on his binch. 
I've a 
friend in the city in business— 
He does carry a 
sign for a 
store— 
He's a 
man of high standing and laming, 
And his equal you never see more. 
CHORUS. 
I've a 
cart and a 
proud Irish donkey, 
And I 
often goes out for a 
drive. 
Shure I 
has the whole neighborhood crazy 
In the part of the town I 
reside,

Owen Slattery, 
Writton by DAVID DILLON, and sung with great success by JOHN SHER-. 
HAN, in the greatest of all Irish sketches, entitled 
" 
THE ASH BOX INSPECTOR ." 
My name is Owen Slattery, I 
am a 
cobbler by trade; 
By mending your shoes me money I 
made. 
I 
have a 
devil's own wife, I 
wish she was dead; 
She can sing tralaloo, and she stands on her head. 
It was only last night that me daughte; Kate Ann 
Invited to supper a 
handsome young man. 
When asked his name he said it was Spoons, 
Recommended by Barnum for juggling spittoons. 
" 
Me fine laddie buck," says I, " March out of here, 
Or be the ghost of old Foley, I 
will bite off your ear." 
)He made a 
lush for the door, with a 
lump on his skull. 
He thought I 
was Ajax, or else Sitting Bull. 
Me wife, in a 
flutter, seized hold of a 
brick, 
And called me a 
slugger and flannel-mouth Mick. 
" 
Tearanouns," says I, " Ellen, don't give me a 
guy." 
I 
made a 
short stop on the ball of her eye. 
There's Pat McNamara, from sweet Donegal, 
The ash box inspector, elected last fall; 
He wears a 
gold watch and chain and a 
scented boquet, 
I 
wish that the devil may wid him fly away. 
It was only this morning he sent me a 
card 
To fresco the alley, and whitewash the yard. 
Bad luck to the sucker, if I 
had him here, 
I 
would play seven-up on the edge of his ear.

Enthroned the great Jehovah holds 
The glitt'ring sceptre Aurora holds! 
To light the morning path o' life. 
Thou, happy, free from earthly strife, 
Then wend thy way o'er roses sweet, 
Where cunning violets greet thy feet.

Oh, why are you so shy my love 
When I 
am by your side, 
And why within your handkerchief 
Your pretty dimples hide; 
I 
try my best to win your heart, 
You answer " yes" and " no," 
Oh, darling, if I'm in the way 
Why don't you tell me so ? 
CHORUS. 
No satisfaction I 
can get, 
You answer " yes" and " no,' 
Oh, darling, if I'm in the way 
Why don't you tell me so? 
Why do you turn that little head 
When I 
attempt to kiss, 
And why your drooping 'eyelids close 
-Oh, darling, tell me this? 
To me you are the fairest flow'r, 
The sweetest bud I 
know, 
But if my love you can't return, 
Why don't you toll me so ? 
No satisfaction, &c. 
Why is it that you cannot love 
When I 
am close to thee, 
Oh, tell me why you will insist 
To scarcely notice me; 
My heart I'll fondly give to you, 
Oh, now 'tis bowed with woe, 
, 
And darling, if you will accept

I 
wish you'd tell me so. 
No satisfaction, &c.

Shure mild Ireland is our home, 
All alone o'er the foam,

THE TWO LOVE LETTERS. 
Written b: CHARLEY EVAN8. 
Performed by the Great Specialty Comedians, Num & Evatis. 
Copyright 1876, by A. J. Rama, 98 Nassau Street, New York 
First Swell. 
Oh what a 
shocking plight, I 
was placed in Sunday night, 
Just listen to me now, and I 
will tell: 
I 
was sitting by the side of her that was to be my bride, 
When in came a 
gallus colored swell. 
He came up to we, and spoke with perfect candor, 
And swore he'd wed my own, my sweet Amanda, 
And that if I'd interfere, he would stand me on my ear, 
But I'm sure that she levee none else but me. 
[Dance and exit. 
Second Swell. 
Ah! this must be the street where they say he °Wei to meet 
Nearly every night, at eight, my own beloved. 
Now 
if this Nig. I 
see, I'll shoot him or he'll shoot me, 
And I'll make his nose look like a 
boxing glove. 
Then I'll marry her, my beautiful Amanda, 
We'll pack our duds and go to Indiana; 
Then if we don't agree, a 
divorce will set me free, 
And back I'll come to win another girl. 
[Dance—enter 1st swell. 
Second Swell. 
Ha! Ha! we meet at last. Now to you do I 
request, 
That you, to me your claim on her give over. 
First Swell. 
No, no, I'll never yeild if I 
have to take the held, 
And my claret must be spilt upon the clover. 
Spoken.—Nay, nay, kind Rudolph, I 
will not give up the guyrl. 
Second Swell. 
Then, by Heaven's, you die at early candle light, to-morrow 
at noon. 
First SWell. 
But the young lady loves me the best, because I 
received 
a Billy Ducks from her a 
few moments ago. 
Second Swell. 
Oh! you mean a 
billet doux. 
Well, that's funny, I 
got one 
myself which I 
hav'nt had time to read,

first Swell. 
Well, I'll read mine-right in front of you to show how I 
stand 
with Amanda. (Opens envelope and reads.) 
Mr. Duplex— 
Dear Sir: 
It would give me great pleasure never to 
see your ugly face again, and if you ever show your monkey 
form at our domicile I'll have you saluted with a 
stuff club. 
Yours in disgust, 
• 
AMANDA. 
Oh! this is too much. 
Second Swell. 
Well, I'm sorry for yon, my friend, but none but the brave 
deserve the fair. 
Listen to what she says. (Opens envelope 
and reads.) 
Mr. Oliver Lush— 
Dear Sir: 
I 
would like to see you, no more, 
and ft you present yourself to my residence agaiu I 
will have 
you arrested for arsenic. 
Yours, etc. 
P. S.—I'm to be married to Billy, the Butcher, at 9 
o'clock

First Swell. 
I'll arrest her now on charge of Breach of Promise.

Then we'll be rich you bet. 
Both, 
And we'll buy the butcher out arouud the corner.

WOMAN'S RESOLUTION. 
Written and Sung by C. L. 
DAVIS. 
I'll tell you of a 
fellow, 
Of a 
fellow I 
have seen; 
Who is neither white nor•yellow, 
But is altogether green; 
And his name it is not charming, 
It is only common Bill; 
And be wishes me to wed him, 
But I 
hardly think I 
will. 
Oh! he whispered of devotion, 
Of devotion true and deep, 
And it seem'd so very silly 
That I 
almost fell asleep. 
And he thinks it would be pleasant 
As we journey down the hill, 
To go hand in hand together, 
But I 
hardly think I

With pigeon pies and joints en ?name,

The Grassy-clad Hills of Ould Ireland. 
BUNG BY J'OEN FIELDING. 
It every one cherish the land of their birth, 
No matter what creed on face of the earth. - 
With conviviality, friendship and mirth, 
And charms their own little sire land. 
For it's all Botheration to spoke of a 
nation, 
Or ran down its station from bottom to top; 
The same sky is over its wheat and its clover, 
The time it moves o'er its strength to each crop.

Hurrah for the hills and murmuring rills 
Where the shamrock illumines the mire land, 
Hurrah for a 
home, mnsha vilan och hone, 
Near the grassy-clad hills of °old Ireland. 
In praise I 
will sing of that ewate little place. 
Its name from my bosom will ne'er be erased, 
Until the cold turf o'er my body is placed, 
'Neath the soil of my dear native Ireland. 
Where there's rale hospitality, friends in reality, 
An abundance of charity always in store, 
Plenty to trate yez with, milk and potatoes, 
And plenty to greet yez with, whiskey galore. 
Hurrah for the hills, 
These fond recollections of Erin asthore, 
Will ne'er be effaced from my mind I 
am sure, 
For my heart dwells in transport on that little short., 
Near the grassy-clad hills of ould Ireland; 
For near those hills a 
place is where a

Whose presence it graces a

A

THE GEM THAT DECKS THE SEA. 
Written by HARRY BENNETT for THE M URRAYE. 
Old Ireland's sons and daughters fair, 
They long to see her free; 
They love that little isle so green, 
That nestles on the sea. 
Adversity has been your fate, 
Your sons have had to emigrate, 
The day will come, if we but wait, 
When Ireland will be free. 
CHORUS. 
Erin, Erin, the gem that decks the sea, 
Erin, Erin, the home of mirth and glee. 
Your brave.sons, with stout hearts will fight for liberty; 
Erin, Erin, we'll die to make you free. 
Prosperity and happiness, 
For Erin are in store, 
And all her sons, so brave and true, 
Will hasten to her shore. 
The turf fires they will brightly burn, 
The good old times they will return, 
llibeRnia's sons no more will yearn 
When Ireland she is free.

are four dissipated tramps, 
And that you plainly see; 
We came all the way from Buffalo 
A week ago to day. 
We worked our way upon the cars, 
For money we hadn't a 
dime, 
Until we reached this city 
And our comrades here did join. 
CHORUS. 
Now don't sneer at us when we pass, 
Or say there goes a 
stager! 
Although we're victims of the keg, 
You'll find far worse than " Gaugers." 
This world owes us a 
living, 
And we'll have it to a 
man! 
So let no one despise us 
Because we carry a 
can. 
There's a 
branch that " carries the banner," 
That branch is called V. G.; 
But we're delegates from the " Gaugers," 
Which is far above that degree. 
We go 
our rounds within our bounds, 
So give us the respect we're due. 
We never go around singing:" hard up," 
Or " The faded coat of blue." 
Now don't sneer, etc. 
Bad scran to the " five-cent schooners," 
But it's them we do disdain! 
Since the first day they were introduced 
In the kegs there's not a 
drain! 
But before we turn the corner 
We'll fill our cans, we'll wager, 
And drink the health of " The Hard-up Club," 
And of Our fellow " G-augers." 
Now don't sneer, etc.!

Alit: 
Oatorobn." Written for PEtir tAktk (of-BAKE* ik ir;kaitto.), 
and sting with gteat success'by Dick GbithtAti. 
About twelve o'clock this evening, while down by a 
beer 
saloon, 
I 
met a 
little Deitcher gal what looked at me so soon; 
Her clothes were of the latest style, her shoes they were quite 
new, 
She looked at me, I 
winked at her—I 
couldn't help it, now, 
could you ? 
But then my heart it went flip-flap, when I 
heard her say 
good-bye, 
She threw a 
kiss across the street, saying " How low was that 
for high?" 
My heart it came of my mouth, I 
was in love you may sup-
pose, 
I 
looked again and saw she had a 
red wart on her nose. 
As she passed by I 
smiled at her, while the gang they done 
the same, 
For she was very pretty, though she walked a 
little lame. 
Her toes they out her shoes, her hair it was quite red, 
When one of them roosters hollered out, " Go quick and soak 
her head." 
It was then I 
got excited, whan I 
told them to look out, 
When three or four or five or six quick hit me of my mouth; 
I /*
ell me in the sewer, where the water quick there flows, 
That's what I 
got for lookiiig at that girl with a 
wart on her 
nose.

BROOKLYN CURIOSITIES. 
Bram in Brooklyn by SAm DEVER; at Park Theatre. 
NOW some people are awfully funny, 
Take for instance the " Twelve o'Clock Man," 
Always pro ni tly on han I 
for his money, 
Thou ii his debto. is never on hand. 
Disappointed e 
ch day for these many long years, 
Still he come; a d 
N\ ill stand like a 
rock, 
Always lookin 
for some one who never appears,— 
As he prom sed,—by twelve of the clock. 
MORAL. 
Now if all who get tick would only come up to time, 
And pay off their debts when they can, 
Nobody would sutler for another one's crime, 
Like our friend,—the poor Twelve o' Clock Man. 
Brooklyn city has another curiosity, 
A 
darkey who whistles by steam,— 
He whistles with 1,ghtning vel city, 
With a 
noise like a 
bald eagle's scream. 
He will whistle or die, and he seldom " brakes " down, 
On Yankee Doodle— is favorite air,— 
He whistles a 
1 
d 
iy as he goes th ou h the town, 
And at night he even whistles his prayers. 
MORAL. 
A man may be poor and yet hold up his head, 
And be as gay as a 
bird on a twig, 
He may laugh at life's 
trobles and knock the blues dead, 
If he'll only w..istle, like our nightingale Nig. 
When you want to go over East River, 
And you can't et across for the ice, 
Then you stand in the weather and shiver, 
And say,— ' Wouldn't a 
bridge now be nice." 
That's just what you want, both for pleasure and ink. 
But oftentimes loth are delayed 
By a 
blockade of ice, when there comes a 
big freeze, 
And that's why a 
bridge should be made. 
'Tis all well enough in the summer, perhaps, 
But ferry boats in the winter won't do; 
Then up with a 
bridge and let the ferries collapse,— 
That's my ticket and I 
hope it suits you. 
2s, 
Blow Nutly, Winds, Blow Gently. 
As I 
wander through the fields 
Where the sweet flowers are growing, 
Or down in the meadow where the streamlet is flowing. 
I 
sing that.my love may come safe back to me. 
Blow gently,. winds, blow gently, 
While my love is on the sea. 
For, oh! he is coming ; coming back to me. 
Blow gently, winds, blow gently, 
While my love is on the sea. 
Though the sky is fair and calm 
Above, in sunlight brightly glowing; 
And through the softly waving trees the mildest breeze 
is blowing, 
Far, far, upon the Ocean, ah! what storms may there 
not be. 
Blow gently, winds, blow gently, 
While my love is on the sea; 
For oh! he is coming, coming back to me. 
Blow gently, winds, blow gently, 
While my love is on the sea.

Whatever you require; 
'Twill be my greatest pleasure 
To do what you desire. 
I 
never stop, I 
never " drop," 
I'm up to every plan; 
And everybody tells me 
I'm a 
very handy man. 
CHORUS. 
I'm just the man you're looking for, 
I'm just the man you're looking for, 
Make no mistake, my word you may take, 
I'm just the man you're looking for. 
I 
cross the ferry every day, 
From Jersey's foreign shore; 
Strange people always meeting, 
That I 
never met before. 
If I 
see a 
lady in distress, 
Who does not know the way: 
I 
go to her politely, 
And with a 
smile I 
say— 
I'm just the man, etc. 
I 
have a 
confidential friend, 
Who lives way out of town; 
Last week he sent me a 
letter, 
To say he vr,s coming down. 
He's going to bring his pocketbook, 
To see the sights he'll try; 
Of course I 
wrote immediately, 
• 
And this was my reply— 
I'm just the man, etc. 
Now there's Tom Jones who once was rich. 
His father owned a 
bank; 
But all that's left of fortune 
Is now a 
great big blank. 
From " ducats" he came down to " sous," 
From " sous " to something worse; 
All he can give is " I 
0 
Us," 
When drawing on your purse. 
1 SPOKEN.--I 
met this gentleman to-day. 
He suddenly con-
fronted me; didn't know it till he had me by the hand. " Ah, 
how do you do, old boy?" he said, " I'm delighted to see you!" 
Beautiful weather, isn't it? 
But say, excuse me, I'm—I'm 
rather short to-day; could you oblige me with—" " Now hold 
,on," I 
said, " that's enough"— 
I'm not the man, etc. 
I 
used to visit a 
pretty girl, 
Who said she loved me true; 
My hand and fortune I 
offered her, 
Now what more could I 
do? 
But oh, that girl went back on me, 
For a 
fancy Broadway gent; 
He took her off to parts unknown, 
I 
don't know where they went. 
SPOKEN.—I 
don't blame her so much, but that man—that 
horrid man—who stole away my Maria, oh 
if I 
could only 
lay my hands on him now— 
He's just the man, eta. 
I 
LIVE a 
Jovial, country life, 
Happy am I 
with my home and wife, 
Some met( are richer, I 
envy none, 
Fm rich enough with my dog and gun, 
Early at morning I 
leave my home, 
That is the time in the fields to roam, 
Down in the valley my house you'll see, 
Folks say it's small bat itjust suits me 
Caosus. 
I 
love my wife, my pipe and my glass, 
Gaily along life's road do I 
pass, 
Jolly and free it just suits me 
Out with my gun in the morning. 
Who'd lie in bed when the lark sings higi, 
Up in the blue and cloudless sky, 
Gay as the birds to the fields I 
go, 
Back I 
return in the sunsets glow, 
My dear little wife, as I 
cross the stile, 
Welcomes me home with a 
loving smile, 
P'rhaps other women may fairer be, 
But she's my own and she just suits me. 
I 
love my wife, &c. 
Winter may come and the winds may blow, 
Safe in my home from the frost and snow, 
By my fire-side with my wife I 
sing, 
I 
wouldn't change with a 
crowned king. 
Happy am I 
in my little cot, 
While I 
am content with my humble lot, 
Peonle may sneer at my low deo•ree.

'Twas at a 
ball I 
first met my girl, 
The fairest in the land; 
She had pearly teeth and a 
dimpled chin, 
And a 
little slender hand. 
She skipped around in mazy waltz 
As graceful as a 
fawn ; 
When the dance was o'er I 
asked Irene 
To walk out on the lawn. 
CHORUS. 
We sat by the brook and the stars shone bright, 
And we whispered words of love on that summer night. 
So we walked and talked till it grew quite late, 
But I 
know she has my heart; 
Then I'll bless the day when we get wed, 
And from her I'll never part. 
Next eve we met, near a 
running stream, 
And I 
walked close by her side; 
I 
told her then how I 
loved her so, 
And she said she'd be my bride. 
How happy I'll be all the while 
When Irene is my wife. 
We will have a 
cot by a 
babbling brook, 
And we'll settle down for life. 
We sat by the brook. Scc.

Some deem it but a 
little thing 
To trifle with another's love ; 
To gain the heart's best offering, 
And then to other objects rove.

smart, 
Which years alone can e'er allay, 
And broken many a 
faithful heart 
Which might have thrill'd with love to-day. 
CHORUS. 
Take heed how ye in future deal, 
Nor rudely strike affection's string, 
For wounds which time can never heal 
Have sprung from such like little things. 
Some deem it but a 
little thing 
To pass their humble brother by; 
Nor deign to yield the joys that spring 
From outstretch'd hand and friendly eye. 
But it has caus'd, this little deed, 
Full many a 
scalding tear to roll, 
And many an aching heart to bleed, 
And untold anguish of the soul. 
Take heed, &c. 
Some deem it but a 
little thing 
To sever Friendship's sacred chord, 
And rudely snap the ties that cling 
Around the heart, by some false word. 
But it has caus'd a 
world of strife, 
Where love and peace were wont to reign, 
And many a 
year of after life 
Made doubly desolate by pain. 
Take heed, &e.

About three miles from here,

And the girl helps at the trade, 
And when I've called upon her 
These words I've often said:

Mary Ann McLaughlin, don't you cry, 
Take that apron from your eye ; 
Don't you let the neighbors hear you sigh, 
And we'll be married by-and-by. 
Now soon I'm going to married be, 
Of course I'll settle down ; 
I'll buy a

I 
Only Just Wanted To Know. 
How oft you are meeting with people 
Who seem to have nothing to do, 
But prying in somebody' L 
business 
Or asking their questions of you, 
And when you ask why they're so anxious, 
They will stammer and smile and they bow, 
And then they will say, 0, excuse me I 
pray, 
Now I 
only just wanted to know. 
Cno-
tscs. 
Now I 
only just wanted to know, 
You know, you know, you know, you know, 
No barns in the question to ask you know, 
For I 
only just wanted to know. 
If the ring that you wear is a 
diamond, 
If your gold watch and chain isn't brass, 
If your moustache is red and you dye it, 
If one of your eyes isn't glass, 
If the lady you took to hear Beecher 
Is the wife of your friend so and so, 
Now don't think me rude or I 
wish to intrude, 
Now I 
only just wanted to know. 
(Chorus). 
There's Jones and his wife are so happy, 
Their twins took a 
prize at the show 
For having the hair that was reddest, 
While there's is black as a 
crow, 
Jones asked me if him they resembled 
And in answer I 
said to him " No," 
He rusliel down street and while running screeched 
That's all, lie just wanted to know. 
(Chorus). 
If somebody knows there is something 
That nobody else doesn't know. 
Should somebody tell it to some one 
if somebody wanted to know, 
For somebody said that somebody 
Had been saying somebody said so, 
Now don't think me rude, that I 
wish to intrude, 
For I 
only just wanted to know. 
(Chorus). 
W HEN I 
landed in New York, 
All the way from Cuslialoch, 
Where the black birds sung their notes of lamentation 
In every little lay, 
Sure I 
thought I 
heard them say 
May good luck attend you. Pat, in every station. 
When I 
landed in New York 
Sure I 
thought that I'd get work, 
But I 
found that was a 
matter rather hard, so 
I

There I 
think I'll do the best 
When I 
meet my sister Katie in Chicago. 
CHORUS. 
In Chicago, in the State of Illinois;1 
But before I 
say adieu 
I 
will take a 
step or two 
Just as graceful as a 
little lustiardo. 
So blaze away and tear, 
Now the divil a 
hair I 
care, 
For I'm going to meet my sister in Chicago, . 
Down at Castle Garden gate, 
Sure it's there I 
had to wait, 
Now I 
know y-e's all will say it was a 
pity; ! 
The divil a 
one I 
found 
Who would show a 
Paddy round, 
So you see I'm led astray now in your city. 
And no matter where I 
be, 
All the boys make game of me, 
And they holler pipe the tarrier Bernardo; 
With their cry, '• What d'ye saby I" 
Faith me heart knows little joy, 
Till I 
meet my sister Katie in Chicago.

Now don't go giving me advice, I 
know what I'm about, 
I 
am not going to make A 
speech, to drive the people out; 
I'm simply going to sing a 
song, to show that I 
am straight, 
My friends hero tell me I 
am drunk, and say " it's growing 
late." 
Well, they may go, but I'm content to stay just where I 
am, 
When I 
get drunk I 
always go as mildly as a 
lamb; 
But first, allow me to declare that what they say is stuff, 
I 
never get off my lea-base, I 
know when I've enough. 
My wife tried to convince me once, that I 
was beastly tight, 
Of course I 
had been smiling, boys, as I 
have been to- night, 
I 
tried to reason with her, but she said I 
was a 
brute, 
I 
saw a 
storm was brewing, so, says I, " Old boy, keep mute I" 
My wife has got a 
lightning tongue—some of you smile, I 
see; 
Perhaps that some of you, to-night, are in the boat with me; 
Her arguments are striking ones, and I'm not over tough, 
Said I " My dear, I'll go to bed, I 
know when I've enough I" 
A 
big policeman t'other night was going to take me in, 
Says I, " What for?" says he, " Because, you bum, you're full 
of gin!" 
I 
stood up on my dignity and tried to give him bluff, 
He clubbed me 
till I 
cried, in pain " I 
know when I've enough!" 
I 
now submit my case to you, and hope you will agree 
I 
never get chock-full, although I 
like a 
little spree; 
Don't ask me now to take a 
drink, although it's rather rough 
To decline a 
friendly smile, but then, " I 
know when I've 
enough I"

XT'S NOT THE MILES WE 
TRAVEL, BUT TAZ 
PACE TEAT KILLS. 
As we jog along the " Road, 
Of Life" we pass a 
load 
Of discontented mortals who have gone too fast. 
Forfeiting their health, 
In the modern race for wealth. 
Until completely beaten they break down at last, 
But others slow and sure, 
The journey can endure, 
Altho' the road is rugged with its dales and hills, 
They ought to bear in mind, 
in life they'll always find, 
It's not the miles we travel but the pace that kills. 
Remember what I 
say, 
if you wish to pay your way, 
And not be troubled day and night with duns and kil!s, 
Don't travel on too fast, 
Or you may bleak down at last, 
For it's not the miles we travel but the pace that kills. 
I'll tell you in my song, 
How it is I 
get along. 
easily and merrily on life's highway; 
For riches I 
ne'er fret, 
And I 
don't run into debt, 
.;o I 
never find it difficult my bills to pay, 
I 
never rail at fate, 
I 
envy not the great, 
I:mploynient keeps me healthy, and good temper keeps nisfaty 
I 
know that labor's sweet, 
So I 
earn before I 
eat, 
And that's the way to travel, boys, on life's highway. 
Remember what, &c. 
If fortune won't be kind, 
At first, why never mind, 
II-cep boldly trudging on, but not too fast, 
Take both good and bad, 
As it comes, and don't be sad. 
If you only persevere you'll reach the goal at last: 
And if your fare is coarse, 
Think it might have been much worse. 
So travel on contented and don't despise, 
The man thiit's slow and steady, 
Always watching—always ready, 
Is the man to win the " Race for Wealth" and gain the priZa 
I'M ON THE TEETOTAL. 
As sung with great applause, throughout the United 
States, by Miss ELLA W ESNER. 
Day fellow sinners, lend, I 
pray, attention most intense; 
in me you see a 
shining light of total abstinence. 
I've passed a 
very sinful life, got queer for nights and days; 
But praised be thanks, I 
now perceive the errors of my 
ways. 
CHORUS. 
And now I'm on the teetotal, total, total- turn-total, 
Yes, I'm on the teetotal, total, teetotal-ttuai-tay. 
In earliest childhood I 
commenced and with my 
A. B. C. 
Drank S. and B. and prime L.L., took gin with my Bohea. 
I 
nursed the foe that stole my brains; and that is why, I 
think, 
I've grown a 
brainless enemy to every kind of drink. 
SPOLEN. — Mat when I 
signed the pledge suddenly, the 
Delicious trembles came back ten hundred times worse, 
and I 
shook like a 
dish of jelly with the palsy. " Ease it 
off gently," says the Doctor; " dcn't be too rash. 
Take 
your noggin of gin at breakfast, and your Irish hot at 
lunch, and you'r bottle of Port at dinner, and you'r boiled 
brandy and cayenne at bed time. 
Only," says the Doe-
toT, " be moderate." 
Of course medical scienec must be 
rosspcted, so here goes--( takes a 
bottle from his pocket 
and drinks.) 
For I'm now on the teetotal, &c. 
Your worst rogue makes your holiest saint, and that's the 
reason, clear, . 
I'm down upon the moderate man whom I 
catch sipping 
beer; 
I 
call him sundry awful names, and urge him to repel 
The deadly poison; it he won't, he'll sign his own death

I Won't Hear Old Ireland Run Down. 
Written and sung by HENRY CARNEY, with great applause. 
There's a 
dear little spot call'd the Emerald Isle. 
And there one fine day I 
was born, 
So that is the reason my blood always boils 
When people speak of it with scorn; 
Her sons and her daughters are gallant and fair, 
And the country itself is so grand 
That I 
cannot imagine why people should speak 
In dispraise of my dear native land. 
CHORUS. 
So--.. 
for old Ireland, the land of my birth. 
Her sons have gained famous renown, 
'Tis known as a 
glorious picture on earth, 
So I 
won't hear old Ireland run down. 
I'm sure that no Irishman ever need be 
Ashamed of those heroes gone by, 
Who fought like true Irishmen only can do 
When foes of their country were nigh; 
And in modern times, when for England thay fought, 
They were foremost and first in the fray, 
And at the Crimea, when danger was near, 
Pat never kept out of the way. 
So--Hurrah for old Ireland, &c. 
The names of O'Connell, and all such as he, 
Should make every Irishman proud; 
They were Ireland's heroes, and showed that they were 
With wit and with wisdom endowed; 
They spoke for their country. as every man should, 
No matter what country or creed; 
'So we never need be ashamed of Ireland's sons, 
For they proved true in thought, word and deed. 
So—Hurrah for old Ireland, &c.

So there's no use in telling ye's that; 
The place that I 
came is far o'er the main, 
Where every one is known as Pat! 
Now my brogue to you may seem strange— 
It has such a 
perculiar twang! 
But the accent is sweet and the movements is nate 
Of a 
North of Ireland man. 
CHORUS. 
I'm a 
North of Ireland man, 
And me name it is Roger McMann; 
The style of me brogues, 
And the cut of me clothes,

first struck this beautiful place,

Sung by the FrELmsos. 
When first we struck this country, 
You never saw such a 
pair. 
We were both green—also very lean; 
And kind of off was our hair. 
She wore an old homespun dress, 
And I 
the corduroys, 
Big brogues and breeches short! 
We were a 
a 
treat for the boys. 
CHORUS. 
We're not so green now as then, boys! 
Not so green now as then; 
We went through your schools, 
When we were both fools. 
We're not so green now as then! 
They called us Gawks, and Hi Pubes; 
And about fifty more such names. 
We lugged bags full of bricks— 
Some of you may have done the same. 
In the street we have kicked hats, 
And nearly broke our toes; 
We've chased Tom Collins a 
whole block I 
And have had corks upon the nose! 
We're not so green, &c. 
NOT BEFORE PA, DEAL 
As sung by COOL BURGESS. 
Some lovers are so bashful, 
They will never say a 
word, 
But only blush and tremble, 
Which looks, I'm sure, absurd. 
While others they will kiss their love, 
Or know the reason why; 
But when my charmer's pa is near— 
These words are her reply— 
CHORUS. 
Not before pa, dear, not before pa, 
Say that you love me, but not before pa; 
Not before pa, dear, not before pa, 
I 
don't mind a 
kiss, dear, but not before pa. 
_ 
I'm very fond of flirting, 
But there's one I 
love best; 
I'm sure I'm rot too bashful 
In seeking love's request. 
Last night I 
went to see her pa, 
To squeeze her hand I 
tried; 
When I 
called her my little queen, 
These words she then replied_ 
Not before pa, &e. 
We strolled into the garden, 
And underneath the trees, 
We sat upon the lovers' seat, 
To inhale the summer breeze ; 
I 
told her how I 
loved her, 
Which caused a 
dreadful sigh; 
And when I 
said, " Oh, name the day," 
These words were her reply—

CENE. —A 
drateing-rown. 
Frank (writing at table).—Well, thank Heaven, the bustle 
and stir of our wedding is all over. 
I 
can hardly realize 
that I am a 
married man. 
What ! I, a 
quiet batchelor 
heretofore—almost afraid of the sound of my own voice— 
to be suddenly transmogrified into a 
happy husband! It's 
a 
pleasant dream! 
It can t 
be real. 
What a 
pleasure it is 
to sit down and write in the seclusion and quietness of 
one's own house. 
No noise. 
No tumult. 
Thank the 
stars! I've got such a delightful, good-tempered, and 
charming little wife, too. 
Why, she is just as quiet as a 
mouse in a pineapple cheese. 
Alt! there's nothing like 
matrimony, after all; that is, for such a 
nervous indi-
vidual as myself. 
There, I 
have almost finished my 
letter, 
and I 
have not suffered a 
single interruption. 
Now, if I 
were a 
batchelor, there would most certainly be from half-
a-dozen to a dozen wandering organ-grinders prowling 
about my window by this time. 
Kitty (singing without). 
Frank.—That's my wife! Oh, Lord! I 
thought she did ' nt 
sing. 
Ugh! how that " crescendo " grates upon my poor 
nerves! 
Really, it's too much. I 
can't stand it,

ENTER, K ITTY. 
Kitty. — Why, how do you do this morning, my dear 
Frank? Come and kiss me, do now ; wont you, my darl-
ing teazy-weazy pet of a 
husband? (They embrace.) Thank 
heaven, therels no " excise " edict against a 
man kissing 
his lawful wife, is there, Frank ? 
Fat nk — No, my love. 
In my case, you see, it's the 
"Frank-ine privilege. 
Really, I 'm delighted to see you 
look so charming this morning; but, don't you think you 
will injure your throat by such vocal gymnastics as I 
just 
heard you perform, and so early in the day, too? 
Kitty. — Oh, bless you, no! 
Why, when I 
was at home 
I 
used to wake up everyone in the house, long before day-
light, practicing my favorite operatic gems. 
Everybody 
used to admire them so. 
Frank—Did they, indeed, my love! 
[Aside.- 011, dear ! 
here's a 
pretty prospect for a 
quiet man.] 
So you were 
quite an early bird, eh ? 
Did you ca:ch the worm, my 
love ? 
Kitty.—Yes, and I 
pleased Ma and Pa immensely. 
Would you not like to hear me render my last " scena," 
Frank? 
Frank ( aside).—[ Worse than "sena" and salts to me!] 
"Well, my pet, you must excuse me. I 
have to go directly 
down town. 
Some other time I 
will hear you with pleas-

Kitty. — Yes, and I 
am so glad that I 
have got such an 
appreciative husband. 
You know I 
can sing you to sleep, 
sing you awake, and sing—sing to delight you all the 
blessed time.

too, just as much as I 
like!

single moment.

you?

on his back, and Kitty beating it violently in the rear.]

LOVE'S SEREN ADE, 
Words and Music by CLAUDE DEHAVEN. 
(Copyright secured.) 
WHEN in my dreams I 
fondly think of brother, 
When in visions fondly dream of motber, 
When the night long watch is ended, 
And the busy day suspended, 
All my fancies, all my visions may come true, 
Still in fancy dreaming I 
only love but yo4u. 
Whed the midnight stars are peeping, 
And the silvery dew seerating 
Fragrance for the corning day; 
When auroras charms are blended 
To the Southern skies extended, 
Memory paints the picture—no m 
itter what you st,y. 
Deftly clings the moonlight 
On the curtained starlight. 
Chequered clouds of fancies floating all around; 
Glinted zephyis playing...stately actions swaying 
In this pure Elysian—this holy fancy ground.. 
Fire-flies dancing in the humming. 
Angels on their lutes are strumming. 
Love's cohorts in armor coming, 
O'er the mountains dipped in dew. 
Victory on their banner ensigned, 
Glory on their armor entwined, 
still in fancy dreaming, I 
only love but you.

celebrated sensational play, called 
CHARLOTTE TEMPLE. 
Oh! can it be, innocent maiden, 
Thou k

When Nature with passion is laden, 
From gray earth to bright sky above ? 
What softens the dark rugged mountain 
What daintily 'tireth the corn? 
What peoples with Naiads the fountain, 
And perfumes the zephyrs of morn?

It is love! the spirit of beauty!

Nor thence let him ever depart.

And pack up our duds to come here—

For though black slaves are of course unknown here, 
We wives you'll find are the slaws of the ring, 
Our husbands nightly, most unpolitely 
With their companions abroad will roam; 
Of us ne'er thinking, they go off drinking, 
While we are crying our eyes out at home. 
CHORUS. 
Think, think, how slowly the moments pass, 
While you're enjoying your pipe and gl ss, 
Think, think how slowly the moments pass, 
Now gentlemen pray mind what I 
say, 
And look, look at the zlock. 
Now thus to leave us, and so deceive us, 
I'm sure you'll own is a 
monstrous sin, 
For there's no knowing where you are going, 
Or what bad company you may get in, 
For when you tell, deceitful fellows, 
That at your club you have passed the night. 
At that casino you're often seen oh, 
You must acknowledge now that is not right, 
Think, think: &c. 
Then when returning we're soon discerning. 
That in your manner there's something queer, 
You whisper Sa:mon but that's all gammon, 
It's something stronger than that I 
fear, 
It must be really, for when awaking, 
A 
noise you're making for a 
cup of tea, 
You didn't ought to want Soda water, 
Through eating Salmon you must agree, 
Think, think, cte. 
I'm light as a 
cork, I'm happy and gay ; 
On the heel- tap I 
come, just to pass time away. 
Oh, I 
in happy-go-lucky, all day, you see, 
The merriest darkey that ever could be. 
I 
charm all the fair sex, I 
make their beaux frown; 
My heel makes the music just where it comes down. 
Oh, I 
feel like a 
grasshopper, nimble and gay, 
And dancing just carries this darkey's way. 
CTIORUS. 
Dancing all the time! 
Dancing all the time! 
On the light fantastic toe, I'm dancing all the time. 
Dancing all the time! 
Dancing all the time! 
Trouble never troubles me, I'm dancing all the time. 
Old trouble may come, I'll let him alone; 
He's a 
bad friend, I'm sure, for a 
fellow to own; 
Oh, the twist of the grape-vine is just my style, 
It makes a 
man happy most all the while. 
'Way down in the ball- room I 
make the folks stare, 
For fun and for frolic, you'll find I 
am there. 
So wherever I 
go, if there's fun to be found, 
If you keep your eye open, you'll find me around. 
JOLLY PADDY. 
NEAT IRISH SONG AND DANCE. 
(A Parody on " Pretty Peggy.") 
Written and composed by DAN SULLY 
Performed by Miss EMMA DEZODA. 
I 
love an Irish boy now, Paddy that's his name, 
Laughing Paddy, jolly Paddy, he loves me the same; 
'Twas a 
fine Summer's night, 
And the morn was shining bright, 
I 
met Paddy, my darling, my true one. 
He told me that he'd be true, 
And I 
said I 
loved him too, 
Then we commenced to sparking. 
Down by the brook at the end of the lane, 
Of the future and our love we both were talking. 
(Dance.) 
About a 
year has passed, and the time is coming fast, 
When myself and Paddy shall be one at last ; 
Then we'll settle down, in a 
cot not far from town, 
We'll be happy and jolly, 
And in quarreling we'll not be found. 
I 
will ne'er forget the day, 
That I 
heard him say--
Oh! Peggy, I 
love you. 
As he is an Irishman to keep his lov( I'll try, 
He'll keep his vows to Peggy, I'll be bound,

JOHN THEY WANT YOU FOR MAYOR. 
I 
NSTRUCTIVE AND INTERESTNi, 
Written by FRANK TURNER for JOHN REILLY. 
Good evening, m, friends, you're all looking well, 
I 
came here to see you -and my troubles to tell ; 
Whin I 
go along the street the boys at me stare, 
And they all holler out, •‘ John, they want you for Mayor!" 
The other day, walking down Baxter street, 
One fellow said I 
looked like a 
beat. 
I 
ran for the blackguard and pulled down his hair, 
And he shouted out " John, they want you for Mayor!" 
Their shouting at me I 
now understand, 
It's because they want my education and land. 
They'll never get nothing from me, I 
do swear, 
unless they all say '• John, we want you for Mayor I"

American Forttinc-Ta ; Ing Cards.—This is tne old-
est and most widely known pack of Fortune-Telling Cards. We have

monds and Spades—and each or these into K for King. Q for Queen, 
Snd K 
for Knave, and numbers 1, 3. to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
tour rows, and are to be read accord.ng to directions. 
Many of the an.

method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very httla study will suffice to an ordinary under-
standing.

Courting Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a way as to be non- committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too difti. 
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture uprn asking the momentous 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unlady-like encourage-
Mont. As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prol onged

enj
oyed 
i
n 
the 
happiness of matrimony. This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of qaestions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties
