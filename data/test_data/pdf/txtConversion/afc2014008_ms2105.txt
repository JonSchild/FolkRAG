For t

J

i
l
led y
ou i
n on my background,
 
but t
here was one period o
f my career I
'
d l
i
ke t
o e
xpand on a l
i
t
tle. I
 
was happily t
eaching away a
t a California S
tate University i
n 1
975
 
when I
 was i
nvited by Ralph R
inzler, D
irector o
f t
he Festival o
f
 
American Folklife t
o help work on t
heir b
ig B
icentennial
 
e
xtravaganza. I
 t
ook a t
wo year l
eave o
f absence and moved t
o
 
Washington D
.C. and somehow o
r o
ther, never again had t
ime t
o l
ook
 
back. To s
tart w
ith t
he 1
976 Festival was an absolute s
tunner, a
 
r
eally  m
ind-blowing experience. .
 No one, I
 believe, who had t
he
 
g
reat good f
ortune t
o see i
t
 a
l
l t
he way t
hrough was ever quite  t
he
 
same again.
 
I
t l
asted 12 weeks, a massive d
isplay o
f American t
raditions
 
and t
heir r
oots as t
raced a
round t
he g
lobe, o
rganized i
n
to major
 
sections, each t

t
s p
lace i
n t
he g
rassy space a
long t
he
 
r
eflecting pool between t
he Washington Monument and t
he L
incoln
 
Memorial.  Talk about empowerment.  We were s
urrounded a
l
l day
 
l
ong by t
he most potent and best beloved s
ymbols o
f our c
ountry.
 
One morning t
he entire I
talian-American delegation i

laying t
heir
 
t
amborines and bagpipes and button accordions a
round and a
round t
he
 
s
tatue o
f t
he Great Emancipator. You could hardly help t
he t

i
ke
 
most o

hat morning
 
t
hey absolutely r
evelled i

There were f
i

-

A

each week. And t
here was O

i
nally  t
here was Regional America, t
hat t
ook
 
a k

rought i
n
 
1

ive t

a

rriving f

he United S

and f
rom a

One o
f my particular duties t
urned out t
o be t
he welcoming o
f
 
each g
roup o
f newcomers as well as p
residing over t
he departure,
 
a
lways t
earful, o
f t
he p
revious week's participants.  A kaleidoscope
 
o
f cultures spread out before me -
-
 every week f
i

ix h
undred
 
people speaking any number o
f d
ifferent l
anguages, making more
 
k
inds o
f music and weavings and pots and i
nstruments and s
tories
 
and carvings and dances t
han any sane h

i

o e

And s
o I
 ended t
hat m
ind-blowing s
ummer marvelling a
t
 
a
.  t
he s
heer n
umber o
f small g
roups, s
elf-identified,
 
culturally active, and e
thnicly d
istinctive not only i
nside t
he United
 
S
tates but t
hroughout t
he world.  The t
erm "multi-culturalism" was
 
not i
n u
se a
t t
hat t
ime, but i
t a
lready was p
lainly t
he o
rder o
f t
he
 
day and obviously had been f
or a l
ong l
ong t

omeone who
 
had t
hought a b
it about both anthropology and f
o
lklore, o
f c
ourse I
 
a
lready k
new t
hat -
-
 t
he g

s populated b
y a myriad o
f small
 
g
roups, be t
hey t
r

thnicities, sects -
-
 what e
lse i
s i
t
 
populated w

 k
new i
t
 -
-
 b
ut  I
 s
omehow hadn't s
een  
i
t before i
n
 
a
l
l i
t
s variegated splendor.
 
and b
. I
 came t
o marvel a
t t
he v
i
tality and s
ignificance o
f t
he
 
a
rt f
orms p
roper t
o a
l
l t
hese g
roups.  The Festival was called t
he
 
Festival o
f American Folklife and could and d
id  deal w
ith c
ustoms
 
outside t
he a
rea o
f t
he f
ormal a
rts; however, t
he participants
 
t
hemselves needed t
o be good communicators i
n t
hat u
nfamiliar
 
s
i
tuation i
n
to which t
hey were p
lunged,  and a
rt i
s a r
eadily
 
accessible c
ross-cultural communication s
ystem enjoyed by
 
everybody., participants and observers.
 So s
omehow o
r o
ther, i
t
 
was mostly a
rtists -
-
 g
reat t
alkers a
t t
he l
east,--who t
ended t
o be
 
t
he ones who came t
o d
isplay on t
he National Mall.  And a
fter twelve
 
weeks o
f l
ooking a
t s
nippets o
f t
he aesthetic behaviors o
f a
lmost
 
t
he entire p
lanet, I
 never again could t
h
ink o
f a
rt a
s being a f
r
i
ll o
r
 
an add-on o
r casual o
r i
nsignificant.  I
n every g
roup f
rom
 
everywhere, t
heir a
rt f
orms seemed t
o i
nterlock i
nextricably i
n
to
 
t
he core values o
f t
heir  particular c
ultures.
 
And t
he f
olks t
hemselves a
l
l seemed t
o  k
now t
hat and o
ften
 
made i
t c
rystal c
lear
 i
n t
heir own performances.
 I
 w
ill never
 
f
orget a young Scots woman who t
urned up a
l
l by herself, about a
s
 
b
ig as a m
inute,  w
ith a sweet v
oice l
i
ke some k
ind o
f a Scots s
ong
 
s
parrow.  She was s
upposed t
o t
each s
inging games i
n t
he Childrens
 
Area but she k
new so many s
ongs s
he performed i
n o
ther p
laces
 
a
round t
he f
estival as well.
 One day I noticed t
hat s
he was
 
s
cheduled t
o s
ing a
l
l by herself on t
he main s
tage f
or a half h
our a
t
 
noon.
 Thinking t
his was  a p
retty daunting  assignment f
or an
 
u
naccompanied solo s
inger f
rom anywhere, I
 d
ropped b
y t
o c
hat a b
i
t
 
i
n case s
he was nervous.  And here i
s what s
he t
o
ld me.  "
You k
now,
 
when I
 f
i
rst got here w
ith my l
i
t
tle packet o
f Scots songs and I
 
walked a
round t
he f
estival and I
 heard a
l
l t
he wonderful music here
 
-
-
 t
he A
frican d
rum c
hoirs and t
he b
lue g
rass bands and t
he
 
t
amburitza o
rchestras and t
he I
ndian f
lutes and a
l
l -
-
 I
 t
hought I
'
d
 
j
ust better go back home.  I
 was r
eally s
cared.  But y
ou k
now, every
 
t
ime I
 get up and I
 begin t
o s
ing one o
f my own s
ongs, way down
 
i
nside i
n my own secret p
lace, I
 k
now  
i
t
's t
he p
rettiest t
h
ing o
f a
l
l."
 
And s
he walked out on t
hat enormous bare s
tage and her v
oice r
ang
 
out c
lear and confident and I
 went on my way.  She d
idn't need me a
t
 
a
l
l.  She k
new j
ust who s
he was and j
ust what s
he c
ould do, and her
 
c
ultural i
dentity was doing j
ust f
i
ne.
 
So -
-
 when t
he National Endowment f
or t
he A
rts, a g
rant-
g
iving agency, o
ffered me a j
ob a
t t
he end o
f t
he f
estival helping
 
extend i
t
s p
rogram t
o i
nclude t
hose a
rt f
orms t
raditional t
o small
 
g
roups w
ithin t
he United S
tates, I
 was r
eady t
o t
ry i
t
. I
 a
lready had
 
s
ome i
deas and I
 was a
lso t
otally convinced t
hat t
h
is would t
urn out
 
t
o be a constructive and s
ignificant e
ffort, t
hat i
t was r
eally a
 
u
seful t
h
ing t
o be doing.
 
I
 r
emembered hearing t
he anthropologist Edmund Carpenter
 
r
emark t
hat one o
f t
he i
mportant f
unctions anthropologists had
 
u
ndertaken way back i
n t
he beginnings o
f t
he d
iscipline was t
o
 
search f
or t
hose f
actors t
hat were e
ssential t
o t
he p
reservation o
f
 
t
he human species.  They d
id t
h
is b
y t
rying t
o f
i
nd what e
lements i
n
 
h
uman society were u
niversals -
-
 what f
eatures o
f  behavior were
 
p
resent i
n a
l
l g
roups -
-
 and he said t
hat  much t
o everyone's
 
s
urprise, one o
f t
he r
e
latively f
ew t
rue  u
niversals t
urned out t
o be
 
a
rt.  Absolutely no people -
 not t
he Eskimos, n
ot t
he Australian
 
aborigines, not t
he most environmentally and physically p
ressured
 
h
uman beings we k
now o
f -
-
 n
one o
f t
hem l
ack a
rt.  They a
l
l devote
 
p
revious energies-- p
recious calories, i
f you want t
o t
h
ink o
f i
t on
 
t
he most basic l
evel -
-
 t
o t
he p
roduction o
f music, o
r carvings o
r
 
s
tories o
r some k
ind o
f aesthetic behavior.
 
So when I
 l
ooked a
t t
he NEA, I
 d
idn't s
ee j
ust a bastion f
or t
he
 
e
l
ite a
rts, I
 t
hought t
h
is m
ight r
eally be t
he p
lace, a
t l
east f
or me.
 
Here a l
i
vely s
hop could be set up i
n an activist agency e
stablished
 
b
y  Congress t
o encourage t
he p
roduction and d
istribution o
f a

which I
 had g
rown t
o r
espect a
s a powerful s
chematic o
f t
he v
i
tal
 
qualities o
f t
he many cultures t
hat made up our nation.  And t
hen  I
 
f
ound i
n t
he Endowment's m
ission s
tatement t
he f
o
llowing l
anguage:
 
"
This nation's governance i
s based on our people's
 
commitment t

You had multi-culturalism written r
ight i
nto t
he f
undamental
 
s
tatement o
f t
he agency's purpose, even i
f t
hey called i
t d

t

t
 seemed c

hat t

nderstood  t

o be i

f a
l
l k

ot j

but avant garde, experimental and -
-
 o
f most i
mportance t
o t
he
 
d

f f

o s
haped my particular perceptions
 
-
-
 t
he a
rts t
raditional t
o t
he many g
roups across t
he American
 
l
andscape. Such l
anguage doesn't appear r
egularly i
n American l
aw;
 
p
rior  t
o 1950 serious o
fficial f

t
he establishment o
f what was t

So t
here weren't many models t

But I

I
 believe we must  
encourage t

f our many
 
peoples because only as we hear and s
ee each o

now
 
each o
ther and, l
ooking i
n
to t
he m
irror o
f h
umankind, come t
o s
ee
 
ourselves more c
learly and u
nderstand ourselves better. This i
s t
rue
 
empowerment.  No culture i
s a
l
l o
f a p

ithin i
t
 
s
eeds f
or multiple k
inds o
f development.  Not every part o
f every

hould be equally celebrated; t
