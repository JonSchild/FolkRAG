The Colored Alderman. 
Foster & HUghe'S Great Success. 
Oh ! here we are two colored men, 
As you can plainly see; 
,We both did run for office 
Way down in Tennessee. 
Of course we were elected by 
Majority of one hundred and ten, 
Now everybody greets us as 
The Colored Aldermen. 
Cnonus. 
We'll sing and dance f 
r 
you all night, 
Our style is upper Up; 
To please you all is our delight, 
We're two Colored Aldermen. 
When we were in our southern home, 
We were not satisfied; ' 
We took a 
notion for to roam 
To see this world so wide. 
We started North, East and West, 
To the South we'll go again, 
Where we w.11 be elected as 
The Colored Aldermen.

Our Jack's Come :Lome To-DaY. 
Su ghy C'.F.Sta 
Our Jack's come home from sea. I 
o- day, 
And brown and b.onzed is he, 
For many a 
year he's been away,. 
From his hoine his love and 
tts 
Yet his heart is true as it was of yore, 
his spirits light and gay, 
You little k ow the j 
y 
we felt. 
When be came home to- day. 
You little know the joy we felt, 
When became home to day. 
Cnonus. 
Our Jack's come home to- day, 
Oi r 
Jack's come home to- day; 
The good ship Jane's in 
art again, 
Our Jack's come home to- day. 
Our Jack's come home from sea to-day, 
To make his Neh his bride; 
With loving faith she ne'er despaired, 
Though hope with us died. 
Yet her eyes grew dim, her cheek grew pale. 
She slowly pined away, 
But the lovely bloom's on her face again 
Her Jack's come home to- day, 
But the lovely bloom's en her face again, 
Her Jack's come home to- day. 
Chorus. 
Danger Alley Ball. 
Sung with success by Foster & Hughes. 
Look out we're going to tell you of a 
time we had, 
Way down in Danger'Alley, where the nigs were bad. 
Big Mag with the razor, carve you to de fat. 
Carve off your Sunday clothes, and lacerate your hat, 
One big Carolina coon he had an awful hoof, 
Raised up both hands and took away the roof, 
Wing.up so high hit the ceiling with his head, 
Big wenches fall around untill they were nearly dead. 
Dance. 
Clotilde hemmed away while Jackson led the way, 
All hands full of gin, and bound to have their way, 
Some coons make remarks others didn't like, 
All hands pulled their razors and began to strike, 
Break, 
Big Mag she gave a 
ball pat on her Sunday duds, 
Sent us an invite for a 
couple of bloods, 
Big Mag got excited and slugged a 
German Brewer, 
Next minute all hands tumbled in a 
sewer. 
Dance. 
Only a 
Pansy Blossom. 
Su g 
by Banks W. Winter " Leavitt' Minstrels." 
Alt! only a 
pansy blossom, only a 
withered flower, 
Yet to me tar dearer than all on earth's fair bower, 
Bringing me back the June time of a 
summer long ago, 
The fairest, sunniest summer that I 
shall ever know. 
Cnonus. 
Ah! only a 
pansy blossom, only a 
withered flower, 
Yet to me far dearer than all on earth's fair bower, 
Bringing me back the Ju e 
time of a 
summer long ago, 
The fairest, sunnies summer that I 
shall ever know. 
Only a 
pansy I 
gathered at h r 
feet, 
Faded, unlike the ore that made that summer sweet, 
Still in that pansy blossom her tender feet I 
see, 
From under the church yard grasses bringing her 
back to me.

Bung with great success by EVA BENNETT. 
I've a 
letter that was written long ago, 
'Tis a 
letter that I've treasure0 many years; 
Oh, how often I 
have read those fading lines, 
And over them there's traces of my tears; 
She sent to me her blessing in that missive, 
To see me was her constant prayer; 
The little lock of gray in this old letter, 
Is a 
lock of my angel mother's hair. 
I've a 
letter that was sent me long ago, 
A 
letter that I 
keep with tender care; 
The little lock of gray in this old letter, 
Is a 
lock oi my angel mother's hair.

letter that was writteli long ago. 
That was sent to me across the stormy sea; 
When 'mong strangers I 
was wandering far away, 
And longing home again to ever be. 
But underneath the sod my mother's sleeping, 
She's free from earthly trials and its care; 
Butever next my heart I'll keep herletter, 
Aud the lock of my angel mother's hair.

On a 
cold winter's ev'ning, when bus'ness is done, 
And to your home you retire, 
What a 
pleasure it is to have a 
bright bouncing boy, 
One whom you love to admire; 
You hug him, and kiss him, you press him to your heart, 
What joy to your bosom ' twill bring; 
Then you place him on the carpet, 
And you'll hide behind the chair, 
And to please him you'll commence to sing: 
Cum:us: 
Peek-a-boo! peek-a-boo I 
Come from behind the chair! 
Peek-a-boo! peek-a-boo : 
I 
see you hiding there ; 
Oh! you rascal. 
There. 
Oh, my heart's always light when at home with my wife, 
There joy and peace ever reign; 
With my boy on my knee I'm as happy as can be, 
I 
never knew care or pain; 
He's pretty, he's gentle, he's kind and he is good, 
And ev'ry thing nice, him I 
bring; 
Oh, if ho attempts to cry 
When I 
am standing by, 
Just to please him I 
commence to sing; 
Peek-a-boo! peek-a-boo! Zze. 
When the sunshine of youtb fades, and age bends us low,— 
Joys, like the birds, flown away; 
Then the smiles of our children ever brighten the path, 
Leading where loved ones do stray. 
The music and laughter we ever love to hear, 
Will beam like a 
rain-bow in spring; 
By the fire-side at night, 
With our hearts so free and light, 
We will listen while our children sing: 
Peek-a-boo! peekta-boo! Sae

Close the shutters—Willie's dead, 
Whom we loved so dear— 
Like a

From our home, now sad and drear; 
When the spring-time flowers were blooming, 
And the happy birds sung sweet, 
Anaels called him to their home, 
in Heaven where we shall meet.

Gone in childhood's bloom— 
rillow'd now his lit:13 head 
Li the cold and silent tomb. 
O'er his grave the daisies blossom, 
Where his little form is laid ; 
And the murm'ring streamlet plays 
'Neath the willow's quiet shade. 
Close the shutters, iko. 
Close the shutters—`t7illie's dead; 
Death has claimed him now ; 
Never more, his smile will shed 
Sunshine on poor mother's brow. 
She in almost bro!:en-helrted, 
And our home is sad to-day ; 
Life has lost its Imp,: and joy,

True Irish Gent. 
Words acid music by PADDY M URPHY* 
Copyrighted and published by F. A. NORTH, Music Publisher, 
Philadelphia Pa. 
It's a 
shame on the stage how they mimic our race, 
In a 
style that's a 
mystery to me. 
How the gentry in front will stand such insults, 
And receive such block-heads with glee. 
But if they went to old Ireland they'd make their mistake 
For our boys in style are well dressed, 
And in manners as well to you I'll now tell, 
St it they stand in this land with tlpo best. 
CHORUS. 
For singing and dancing, and all kinds of fun, 
And if ever to old Ireland you went, 
From their head to their toes they wear stylish clothes-
I 
speak of a 
True Irish Gent. 
Some make up their face and look just like fools, 
And walk like a 
dog with three legs ; 
But if they went to old Ireland to show them such fun, 
They would pelt them with stones and bad eggs. 
For it's there you'll find ladies and gentlemen, too, 
Educated, kind-hearted and true, 
ind I 
hope that we'll see that little isle free, 
And the green with the red, white and blue. 
For singing and dancing, &c.

McTurk was a 
Handsome Man. 
AN IRISH RECITATION. 
Delivered by the greatIval of Henry Ward Beecher and 
Bob Ingersoll. 
Pat Reilly. 
INIcTurk was a 
cross-eyed Granger, 
Who came here from Kalamazoo; 
He looked like a 
living skeleton, 
That a 
saw mill had cut in two. 
His wife was a 
second cousin 
To Mulcahey's cousin Dan, 
And it was believed by all the family 
That McTurk was a 
handsome man. 
He met with a 
rai'road accident, 
And lost four out of his five wits, 
He was so ugly if he looked at a 
kicking mule, 
He'd scare the animal into fits. 
A 
wart as big as a 
door knob, 
On the end of his red nose grew, 
He would fall apart only he was stuck 
Together with Spahling's glue. 
He slept on the top of a 
picket fence, 
And the sparrows and Jersey crows, 
ID 
winter time used to warm themselves 
At the tire on the end of his nose. 
He never changed his linen, 
lie lived on the free lunch plan, 
And now ain't it funny, 
Because he had money, 
The Bowery girls called him honey, 
And said MeTurk was a 
handsome DAIL

My name is O'Brien from Harlem, 
An Irishman as you can see; 
I 
can sing like a 
thrush or a 
starling, 
Or the little bird up in a 
tree. 
But the gang that stands there on the corner, 
Are trying the steps and the dance; 
And they shout out whenever I'm passing, 
There's O'Brien with his high-water pants. 
ClIORts: 
They tell me to go over to England, 
And pay a 
short visit to France; 
And there to bring out my new fashions, 
And call them the high-water pants. 
Last week I 
went to the theatre, 
Along with my first cousin Dan; 
We hired a 
seat down in the parquette, 
Behind the big man in the band. 
When a 
linger came cut with a 
banjo. 
He played up a 
high-land clog dance; 
And he gave out a 
gag and a 
Con-nun-drums 
'Bout O'Brien and his high-water pants. 
alums 
One night as I 
strolled down the Bowery, 
Along with a 
friend, Paddy Brock. 
We tho't we'd just drop into Geoghan's, 
To try some of his rye and rock. 
When the gang all cried there's Dan O'Leary, 
The bar- keeper shot me a 
glance; 
" 
Howld your tongues " then said he to the loafers 
Ma's O'Brien with his high-water pants.

Ho:v JOHN REILLY, who stands without fear whenever he does appea.r. 
I 
Ye got a 
crazy daughter, she's foolish in her head; 
She never minds me in anything I 
say. 
She's always reading song books, never goes to bed, 
For her schooling every month I 
have to pay. 
She's stuck on the profession—on actors she is mashed— 
She's crazy for to work in Harry Hill's. 
She has challenged Murphy and Rowell to win O'I,eary's belt. 
She is the laughing stock for all the gills. 
CHORUS. 
Eileen banana, sweet Louisiana, 
Slobbery days, baby mine. 
Flaherty's frisky from drinking whiskey, 
What an education has Miss Rubenstein. 
I 
sent her to the country to benefit her health, 
For the people on our block are mighty glad. 
Ever since she's been away she's never been herself, 
And the folks they say she's raving staving mad. 
She walks the streets barefooted, wears her sister's clothes, 
Rings the door bells on our block each day; 
She's milking all the chickens, feeding corn to cows, 
And scares the people when they hear her say— 
Eileen banana, Sze.

Never Prove False To a 
Friend. 
Written by CLAUDE DE 
HAVEN, 
Sung with great applause 
by TONY PASTOR, America's Own Comic Vocalist. 
Never prove false to a 
friend, 
In love and in friendship be true ; 
Never prove false to a 
friend, 
So long as he's faithful to you. 
He may be dishonest—a 
knave— 
In other's opinion—but then 
To you he is generous and kind, 
And one of the noblest of men. 
CHOEUS.—Never prove false, Jr..e. 
Is any man free from each fault, 
All righteous and good in his ways ? 
Lives there a 
woman on earth, 
That she can be named but in praise ? 
Never speak ill of a 
friend, 
To gossipers keep closed your ear ; 
An excellent rule, in the main, 
Is to credit one- tenth what you hear. 
Cuonns.--Never speak, Ix. 
Stand by a 
man in distress, 
When you know he is really in need; 
Altho' by misfortune he falls, 
There's honor for you in the deed ; 
That one may deceive you ' tis true, 
Then his, and not yours, the disgrace; 
Because we find one man untrue, 
Should we wrong and distrust a 
whole race? 
CHORUS. — Never prove false, &c. 
Censure a 
man for his faults, 
Give him honor where honor is due; 
But never prove false to a 
friend, 
So long as he's faithful to you. 
But should you prove false to a 
friend, 
And think he's ungrateful to you, 
When the journey of life's at an end, 
You'll find he's superior to you, 
Parody on Little Widow Dunn.

Originally snug by Wru 11. lionToN, America's Comique, at the Park 
Novelty Theatre, Brooklyn. 
New sayings arc all the rage on the street and on the stage 
And many a 
glorious maxim you may find, 
But there's one more than the rest seems to linger in my 
breast, 
And often comes a 
floating o'er my mind, 
I 
will tell you here to-night this motto true and bright, 
A 
lesson it conveys sublime and grapd, 
To the beggar at your door, to all people rich or poor, 
Always speak a 
kind word when you can. 
Now if perchance you meet an old friend upon the street, 
lie is poor and all the world may sneer at him, 
Oh, do not pass him by in despair to live or die, 
But remember that his poverty is no sin, 
then help him with a 
will, show that you respect him still, 
Welcome him and grasp him by the hand, 
Do not turn your head away, but remember what I 
say, 
Always speak a 
kind word when you can. 
There's many and many a 
man who no riches can command, 
Yet he may be the noblest of them all, 
Many a 
glorious deed he's done, many a 
victory he has won, 
Yet his honors and rewards are very small, 
But when he's dead and gone, his loss they deeply mourn, 
He's a 
monument of friends on every hand, 
And his praises they relate when they know it is too late, 
For they Dever speak a 
kind word when they can.

Biddy the Ballet Girl. 
Composed by Jas. BRADLEY, and sung with great success by CHAS. 
REDMOND and GEORGIE BLAKE, at Miner's New York Theatre. 
We are a 
gay laboring pair, 
And we have a 
beautiful daughter 
Who never did care much for work, 
'Twas her mother's own wish that she ought to 
We thought that she fancied the stage, 
So we greeted her final request, 
And now she's a 
gay ballet dancer, 
And ranks along with the best. 
CHORUS. 
On the stage she is Madame La Shortie, 
But her right name is Biddy McCarthy, 
She comes home at night and from matinees 
With large baskets of flowers and little bouquets— 
Oh she is our only daughter, 
And her father's the man that taught her. 
She wears spangled clothes, goes round on her toes. 
The pride of the ballet is Biddy. 
La:it Saturday night I 
got paid, - 
So I 
thought I'd go to the theatre, 
So I 
took the old lady along, 
And in the parquet I 
did scat her. 
When thddv came out for to dance 
Our son Danny was up the tier, 
And i 
c 
cried out " Go in, sister Biddy," 
And they bounced him right out on his ear. 
On the sage she is, & c.

Graceful and as charming as a 
lily in the pond— 
Time has passed so swiftly—for, of her I 
am so fond—, 
Basics and the roses, too, they grow around the spot 
Where we parted and I 
whispered— 
" 
You'll forget me not! " 
(Dance) 
We met—I 
really don't know where— 
But still ' tis all the same— 
'or love walks in the busy streets 
As well as in the lane: 
I 
gently pressed her tiny hand: 
She glanced at me a 
shot— 
She dropped a 
flower. I 
picked it up— 
A sweet forget-me-not 
(Chorus and Dance.) 
At last there came a 
happy day 
And something that I 
said 
Just caused her lips to murmur 
And shortly we were wed. 
A 
little cottage by the brook, 
And a 
tiny garden spot 
Where grows a 
little flower called— 
A sweet forget-me-not1

Now list ye to my classic lay, 
Politely hearken loudly, while 
I 
sing of Levi Kassiday, 
A 
blazing star of solid style ; 
From Coney Isle to Zululand, " 
From sweet Cohohohoes to Newfoundland, 
Roam where you will a 
man you'll never find 
Like Levi Kassiday. 
CH011.1711. 
For he's a 
man, understan, wid a 
very fine eye for a 
nice 
young girl, 
And a 
primo judge of Dublin wine, 
And creamy cream of the style, do you mind, 
Wid a 
rose like his nose, 
Of a 
color as bright as the red blue say, 
Oh, it's on the street, there's few you'll meet 
Like Levi Kassiday. 
&-down the street with stately tread, 
And style that dislocates them all, 
Meanders he, enveloped in 
A 
brand new fresh spring suit of weed; 
upon his arm hangs Julia Ann, 
Sweet lady bird of this daisy man, 
A. Don Juhannes in his mind is he, 
This Levi Kassiday. 
(Glarus.) 
When voices sweet were handed round, 
Levi was not behind the door, 
An over strung bass voice has he, 
He sang the " mast " in " Pinafore" 
From Asiah to Kalamazu, 
From Canada w 
to San Frandsen, 
Another one of it vou'il seldom meet 
Like Levi Kassdav

Still I

Massa Clare has gone to Eva, 
Leaving friendless poor old Tom! 
Yet, with trust and strength in Heaven. 
I 
remain a

When de whip to me am giben, 
I'll think of Him who died to save! 
Shall I 
turn against my brother, 
Raise the hand of cruelty?

we must love one another, 
Den we'll get where all am free. 
Patience here I'll go to glory, 
There is comfort for the slave ; 
When de lash makes dis flesh gory, 
I'll pray to him who died to save. 
Good bye, Chloe, farewell children, 
Poor old Tom you'll see no more; 
Mind, be good and hab religion, 
'Twill bear you to the faithful shore. 
Do not wee; nor feel dejection, 
Suffering's over in the grave ; 
But at the glorious resurrection, 
We'll meet with Him who died to save

She showed me the ducks and the drakes, 
She showed me the cocks and the hens, 
She showed me the shovels and rakes, 
And the dear little bass 
in their pens. 
She showed me the birds and the bees, 
And likewise the pigs and the sows, 
She showed me the butter and cheese, 
And also the bulls and thc cows. 
Down, down, 8v.; 
The ducks they would waddle to greet her, 
The geese made a 
terrible row, 
The cocks and the hens raced to meet her, 
And merrily grunted the sow.

Her kindness to all never fails, 
Whenever she passes a 
bull or a 
cow 
They're sure to waggle their tails.

Sweetest darling Cherry Norine; 
Blue eyed beauty, sweetly dreaming,

Form of fairy, winsome, airy, 
Movements of a

Brighter gem than decks the starry 
Diadem of night; 
Rose tints wreathing, perfume breathing, 
Cheeks and ruby bps ; 
Chains of love unconscious weaving, 
Where'er her footstep trips'. 
Merry, laughing, &e 
What the measure ? Gods would treasure 
Such transcendent bliss ; 
Oh ! the deep, enchanting pleasure— 
One ecstatic kiss I 
Still to love her, still to hover 
Near her, and to gaze 
Into orbs whose liquid lustre 
Brightens all one's days.

Oh, how soon we are forgotten 
In this busy world of ours, 
Though we often strew the pathway 
Of our friends with choicest flowers. 
Ev'ry loving deed and action 
is remembered but a 
while; 
And the thanks are oft as heartless 
As a 
flirting maiden's smile. 
Tho' we often strew the pathway 
Of our friends with choicest flow'rs, 
We are very soon forgotten 
In this thankless world of ours. 
Oh, how soon we are forgotten 
in the paths Df daily life. 
Though we aid our lame companions, 
Who are plunged in deepest strife. 
Ey'ry tender word that's spoken 
To a 
friend in sad despair. 
Has a 
meaning seldom relished 
In this bustling world of care. 
Tho' we often, etc. 
Oh, how soon we are forgotten 
When the form is cold and still, 
Though we've helped the poor and needy 
To ascend life's ru gged hill ; 
Some, perhaps, will have it sorrow 
When the Reaper calls us in, 
But, alas! ' tis soon forgotten 
In this thankless world of sin.

You'll Miss Me When I'm Gone# 
As sung by T. M. HENGLER. 
I 
am growing old and feeble, 
My hair is turning gray; 
My limbs are weak and painful— 
Are stiff, and won't obey. 
My dancing days are over, 
My pleasures are all gone ; 
For goodness, not for greatness, 
You'll miss me when I'm gone. 
CHORUS. 
When I'm gone, you will miss me; 
When I'm gone, you will miss me; 
There is one kind heart will miss me, when I'm gofte. 
When I'm gone, you will miss me ; 
When I'm gone, you will miss me; 
There is one kind heart will miss me, when I'm gone. 
What will you do withont ine 
When Winter time comes on? 
Who'll fold their arms around you, 
As I 
have often done ? 
Who'll hug you, and caress you, 
When I 
above have flown? 
You'll know where you can find me, 
But you'll miss me when I'm gone. 
When I'm gone, itz.

Style is what Catches the Girls. 
Copyrighted by E. H. HARDING, 229 Bowery, New York, 
Sung by HARRY BECKWITH. 
Behold a 
young man with a 
weakness for dress— 
I 
trust you won't say that I 
go to excess— 
The latest thing out is my passion to wear; 
I'm envied by gents, and ad rd by die fair! 
Out of the fashion, you're out of the world •, 
Society's pleasures away from you whirl'd, 
At last, tho' not least, now in spite of the churls, 
I 
tell you that style is what catches the girls. 
CHORUs. 
Yes, style is what catches the girls 
Talk about diamonds and pearls ! 
They won't go a 
mile unless you're in style, 
And style is what catches the girls. 
The darlings exclaim as .i. pass down the street : 
" 
Oh ! isn't he ravishing, heavenly sweet 1" 
I 
pass by them slowly with such nonchalance, 
And see them upon me admiringly glance ; 
A 
prince in his carriage could nc'er hope to see 
The sweet admiration bestowed unon me ! 
They smile and they whisper,,and she.ke out their curts, 
I 
tell you that style is what catches the girls. 
Yes, style is, &c. 
Now, not being wealthy, to keep up this pace 
Adversity often allows me no grace 
My chances, sometimes, they are terribly slim, 
But I 
keep my head up, it is sink or to swim ! 
Some maiden of wealth will 
et sweet upon me; 
How can they resist wh-- - their eyes plainly see 
An Adonis in form, fashion, moustache and curls 1 
I 
tell you that style is what catches the girls. 
Yes, style is, Sze.*

You'll find You're the Winner in the End.

Air—True as Steel. 
All this life is but a 
race, of men to gain a 
place, 
Of wealth, destruction, and a 
happy home; 
Some may come in away behind, but you'll very oft?.n 
find, 
That many a 
noble man is left alone; 
But my advice to all mv friends to-night, 
Although you're poor, look manly, stern and bri‘
crlit; 
Love you: neielbor as you ought, and when - life's 
battle's fought, 
find that you're the winner hi the end. 
It was just eight years ago, on a 
night of storm and 
sno 
When a 
beggar, thinly clad, stood on the street; 
A 
rich Banker passes by, but stopped at that sad cry, 
Of a 
penny, just to buy some bread to eat; 
Does he help him as he should, I 
ask of you, 
No! lie scorns him just as rich men often do; 
And the beggar with a 
sigh, says my time is by-and-by 
And he'lliind that I'm the winner in the end. 
Now the years have past and gone, and the subject of

g, 
,if you will listen for a 
while; 
Now the Banker he is poor, even riches are not sure, 
And the Beggar he has riches, wealth and style; 
With cold e 
ad bitter hunger, nearly dead, 
The Banker asks the Beggar for some bread; 
And the pityful cry is heard, he gives him money with 
the words, 
YOU have found that I'm the winner in the end. 
Now 
in this, our glorious town, as I've very often found 
There's a 
hundred just such cases every day; 
Gold is all you need, you'll find, to prosper bear in mind 
It's the king of all the nation people say; 
Our country's been in trouble near and far. 
Peace and honesty seems like a 
distant star; 
We'll reform and do our best, with victory on our crest, 
You'll find we'll be the winners in the end.

The lane that led to school. 
The birds are singing just as sweet 
Upon the chestnut boughs, 
The youthful lovers, as they meet, 
Exchange the older vows ; 
I 
see the fields in verdant gown, 
And feel the breezes cool, 
That used to blow so gently down 
The lane that led to school. 
I 
see the mossy, .te. 
The woods are ringing far and near 
With shouts of boyish glee,

With O'Leary, the walker, I

For to walk a, mile an hour, 
About half past twelve o'clock last night 
A gang gave me a

They woke me tip and set me tight, 
For to walk against O'Leary. 
They took me to a 
great big field, 
And with alcohol set me crazy, 
They stripped me clothes off to the skin, 
And rt made me feel so lazy ; 
It was then the gang commenced to talk, 
Saying who is the terrier going to walk, 
And they said they would hang me if I'd hauls 
When I 
walked against O'Leary. 
The first mile, I 
walked my legs were weak, 
And the gang commenced to holler, 
They spiinkled salt upon the track 
And hit me with an iron dollar_

In after years when you recall

We will put on lots of style, 
And be happy in our little Irish home.

BRIGHT LITTLE SPOT. 
Words and Music by JO/IN W ALSH. The greatest Irish patrioad 
singer in America. 
We're stout-hearted boys from the green shores of Erin, 
That Emerald set in the sea; 
Where bounteous nature her best cloth appear in, 
And choicest gifts scattered free; 
Her mountains and valleys with produce abounding, 
Her rivers and lakes filled with life 
i 
ga:oro; 
Loveliest scenes on all sides are surrounding, 
The home of the shamrock, old Ireland, asthore. 
Cllont:s: 
Hurrah for that bright, little spot on the ocean, 
Harmless around it the rude billows roar; 
True Irish hearts love with fondest (12votion, 
The home of the shamrock, old Ireland, asthore. 
Dear granuail, her daughters are peerless, 
Fair and as fresh as the morn; 
Ever in battle her sous they are fearless, 
Death do I 
hold but in scorn; 
Our hearts ever warm to welcome a 
stranger, 
Those in distress never turn front your door; 
And for our country we'll brave every danger, 
The home of the shamrock, old Ireland, astbore. 
I 
love the bright green, and I'm proud, boys, to wear it, 
To it I 
will ever prove true; 
All loyal Irishmen that feeling share it, 
Deeply, indeed, as I 
do; 
Dktance or climate that bond cannot sever, 
True in our hearts all this wide world o'er; 
The land of St. Patrick, forget it, no, never! 
The home of the shamrock, old Ireland, asthore.

THE WEED ON THE HAT. 
A Parlor Recitation by JERRY COHAN, 
He'd a 
weed on his hat, this sad stranger, 
his clothing, tho' shabby, was black; 
His countenance seemed to grow paler, 
As lw walked with his hands at his hack. 
1 
wondered if he was reflecting 
On bitter, sad things past and dead; 
his mind, seemed to me, as rejeetimr. 
'Chose things, for he oft shook his head! 
But plainer than words did the hat with the wemia. 
Tell a 
story of mourning and sorrow, indeed-
He sat in a 
chair at the table, 
His eyes fixed steadfast on the floor; 
T 
sympathized, but was scarce able 
To tell him I 
pitied him sore; 
My glance caught his eyes as he raised them, 
My pity he seemed to detect; 
" 
This world's a 
sad dream," be exclaimed, then. 
1 
listened with silent respect— 
For I 
felt that a 
sorrowing soul was in need 
Of a 
friend that could feel, as I 
looked at the weed 
He gazed on the floor for a 
minute, 
Then mournfully sighing, he said, 
"Ali. yes; a 
sad dream; nothing in it;" 
Then I 
asked, " if his mother was dead?" 
"No?" " Perhaps sonic dear sister or brother?" 
lie answered, '' I 
never had one;" 
" 
Some near, dear relation or other?" 
He replied, " There are none of them gone." 
Yet no common sorrow could make a 
heart bleed, 
Like the heart of the man with the hat with a 
weed: 
55 
M 
THE WEED ON THE 
-HAT—CONTINutp. 
His mood changed. " Why question?" he thunderd, 
As he suddenly sprang to his feet; 
" 
Dost consider me prey to be plundered, 
By confidence man, and dead beat? 
Or art thou an Epitaph maker? 
As your questions would seem to imply? 
Or Tomb-stone man? Leech ? Undertaker ? 
Which, or either? Come answer, thou spy!" 
Then I 
stammered and stuttered, embarrassed, indeed 
Not a 
word could I 
utter, but point to the weed. 
The tierce light left his eye; " oh!" he muttered, 
" 
My violence pardon, he's dead;" 
Then his thanks for my pity he uttered, 
" 
His memory I 
revere," he said; 
" 
This weed on my hat's a 
memento, 
Of a 
father beloved, but now gone;" 
" 
Your Father? I 
asked; " No, his Country's, 
I 
mourn for dear George Wa ,ltington 
Then I 
borrowed a 
gun to accomplish a 
deed, 
Twas to shoot—not the man—but.the hat with the 
weed.

THE PULPIT, THE PRESS & THE STAGE 
Written by JERRY COHAN for W ALLY PRICE MOTTO SINGER. 
Of all the great levers that move this world, 
The principal ones are but three; 
And when my stran.ge argument I 
unfold, 
Wise people with me will agree. 
The Newspaper ball keeps rolling on, 
While the Pulpit controls the mind; 
The theories that these powers expound, 
Are moving ones you'll find. 
The Theatre, too, does not fail to improve, 
The wisdom of every age; 
So the principal levers that make the world move,, 
Are the Pulpit, the Press, and the Stage. 
Conviction is carried to every one, 
That this life's but a 
fleeting show; 
So Religion is the lever strong, 
To remind us of this, we know. 
Why the veriest hypocrite that can talk, 
And wear sanctimonious ways, 
'Let him enter the Pulpit, we listen, and oft 
are persuaded to believe all he says. 
The Christian, rhe Infidel, no matter win.% 
The wicked, good, weak and strong, 
Must acknowledge the Pulpit a 
lever of power, 
And it moves this world along. 
57 
THE PULPIT, 
THE PRESS, 
AND THE STAGE. 
CONTINUED . 
Next comes the Press, a 
most wonderful power, 
That we love, we fear and admire; 
it tells us the doings of every hour, 
Ad 
of all events as they transpire. 
Its reviewed by all classes, all nations and men, 
Propounding the wrong and right; 
Observe how the Press has improved the world, 
And brought us from darkness to light. 
It brings closer together all countries apart, 
Of all races of men tis the voice; 
The Press moves the world with unerring power, 
'Tis a 
lever in which we rejoice. 
Next comes the Stage, nature's mirror so true, 
both criticised, praised and condemned; 
But the Pulpit and Press has abuses, too, 
And the Stage has so much to commend. 
The grandest of minds were its patron's, I'll prove, 
Even those who have worshipped the Press; 
•And spoke from the Pulpit the doctrine we love, 
Its Charities cannot grow- 
less. 
So the Stage moves the world with the Pulpit and 
Press, 
In one how ' twill portray- a 
whole age; 
And the principal levers that move the world, 
Are the Pulpit, the Press and the Stage.

A. man well known to fame, 
I'm a 
shining light at all the clubs, 
I'm a 
man of pluck and game. 
I'm the best known man on Broadway, 
On account of my form and face. 
And the stylish way I

With a

I'm a 
man of splendid parts. 
I've a 
high-born education, 
I'm decomplished in all the arts 
I 
can swim like Captain Boynton,

Fm a 
crack shot ou the wing.

CHORUS. 
Waltzingham McSweeney, 
That's the cognomen I 
be, 
The ladies admire my pretty share 
And aristGcratic air, 
The swells they all get jealous, 
When the dashing girls at me tear, 
'or my graceful glide in the ball-room, 
I'm called the gay cavalier. 
I'm a 
great pedestrian walker, 
My record dates far back, 
I'd be sure to beat O'Leary, 
If they'd let me on the track, 
I'm known at all the races, 
My bets are all the boast, 
I 
can always name the winning horse, 
Before he leaves the post, 
All politicians seem to know me, 
They shake my hand with pride. 
For they know my great influence 
In elections turn the tide. 
All the Congressmen and Senators, 
Admire me everywhere, 
And Waltzingham McSweeney, 
some say will be your Mayor.

You've all heard of the solid men, 
And men of great renown; 
But if you'll listen for awhile 
I'm certain you will own 
That I'm the mot respected man 
In this treat town ; and why? 
It is because when I 
walk out 
You will hear the people cry— 
CHORUS. 
I'm Mr. Johnny Dougherty, the tailor 
A

And everybody knows that to make a 
suit of clothes 
I'm the very best you'll find in all the town. 
I've heard them say a 
tailor is 
The ninth part of a 
man; 
Let them get up and knock me 
Into nine parts if they can. 
Devil a 
one would ever dare 
To box me for a 
foe, 
For I 
can box as well as stitch, 
45 very well they know. 
I'm Kr. Johnny Dougherty, &C.

American Fortune-Telling Cards.—This is the old.

Va e 
have 
published it for years, and the demand is continually increasing. 
These Cards are arranged and printed in series—hearts. Clubs, Dia-
monds and Spades—auti each of these into K for King. Q for Queen, 
and K 
for Knave, and numbers 1. 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
four rows, and are to he read according to directions. Many of the an-
swers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. 
The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under• 
standing. 
Many professional Fortune-Tellers use these cards, and we 
are in receipt of letters in relation to them from all parts of the U. S.

Courting Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
ta meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of moans of 
expressing one's aentimeats in such a 
way as to be non-committal. 
Maw...young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too diffl. 
O2 
er, nevoo fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the zumnentoms 
ntratram. 
The lady is restrained, by cuatom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unladylike encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. This pack of Cards Will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes a 
further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed oy evening parties
