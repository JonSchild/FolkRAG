Interview Log 
00:00:01 Introduction 
00:00:15 Tracey's job title: Diversion Coordinator; she works with clients coming for shelter and tries 
to find solutions to prevent them from having to enter the shelter system; also completes 
intakes for shelter placements when no other alternative can be found. To access city- 
funded shelters, a referral is required; 
00:01:16 To access city-funded shelters, people must have a referral from a location such as hers, and 
these shelters call her location 3 times/day to advise if they have openings. Of the city- 
funded shelters there are: 
• 15 shelters for families; 
• 7 shelters for single women; 
• 6 shelters for single men; 
To stay at private (non-city-funded) shelters, clients can walk in without referral; 
00:02:20 Shelters are over-capacity this time of year (October) due to: 
• impending colder weather when people might otherwise stay outside; 
• "eviction season" (which is her phrase) because landlords cannot evict people 
during severe weather so many hurry to evict right before winter; 
• the start of the school year when families want to be stable and have their kids in 
school so they are looking for housing resources; 
Prior to trying to accessing shelter, many families move house-to-house with friends and 
family; 
00:03:59 When shelters are at capacity, families stay here at Garfield Center "overflow"; (can fit up to 
170 people); if Garfield Center is full, people are sent to Salvation Army;

Outreach Worker doing:

room; there are four transportation teams, each with an area of town; teams also do "drive- 
bys" to see if they find people in need;
