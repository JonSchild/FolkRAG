QUESTIONER: Did you ever eat the sunflower seeds?
RESPONDENT: Oh yeah, I'd buy them here.
Q: How do you eat them?
R: Well, I just eat them like peanuts. We got some over there, they're already, they're
already shelled. But over there, you'd cracked them out, you see.
Q: How did you do that?
R: Just in your mouth.
Q: Just in your mouth. What did you do with the ...?
R: Spit seeds, and spit the hulls ... peeling out.

Q: Did you put them in a container, or was that right next to you on the floor?
R: Well, you'd have them in a container, you know, you'd have them, you'd stick them in
your pockets unless you was going somewhere. And eat them.
Q: You must have been neat, because I remember my grandfather he'd sit at a table and
he'd have a whole pile of sunflower seeds. And they'd call them canuck seed. Is that what
you called them?
R: No. (unintelligible).
Q: A what?
C 20 page 2
R: Summer blooming cairn.

R: No. Well, I mean they'd mill, but they could shell them, the stuff. I didn't see the little
mill. They had a little mill in the town. Somebody owns, you know. And they'd, they'd crack
the seeds out, and get the hulls out. And there'd be a little of, sometimes a few of the
seeds they'd been, and they'd press the oil out of it. And then whatever staid in the cake,
they'd give you the sunflowers, back the cake, there'd be some seeds in it and there's what
have you, you see. The waste, they'd give you back, and you'd feed that to the horses.
Q: Well that was good feed.
R: You see, they'd put it in water, you know, and then they'd sprinkle it over the feed.
Because over there, they feed straw. Rye straw.
Q: Rye straw.
R: I mean wheat straw.
Q: Oh.
R: And the shaft is something special.
Q: Yeah.
R: You see they'd put it in a special place. Everything eats

straw over there. They don't have any hay. Where we come from. And then you take the
<unintelligible text> pen up in the wintertime in a shed, and if a lamb, if a sheep has lambs
in the wintertime they got the stove embedded in the house, you know. It's about say
about a bit longer than this, and you can put in about two cast iron kettles in there. And
that's where the heat comes out. And the stove, the stove might be that far from the wall
on the one side. On the other side it's further away.
Q: Four or five feet.
R: About three, four feet. On the one side. But on the other side, it's wider, you know,
where the beds are setting. And if you get a small calf or a lamb, you'd take it in there and
you'd keep it on you, you might have it take out, let the lamb suck, you'd take it out. The
calf, you'd keep it in there until you let it get pretty good size before he turned. Of course
they had them on the bucket. They milked the cows and fed the calves on the bucket, you
know. But the lambs, they let them suck, they take them out and let them suck, and bring
them back in, see. But they have, come in January, because over there it gets forty below
zero, where we come from. And the snow gets three or four foot deep.
Q: Is that all?
R: So when you break a horse to ride, and if he gets to bucking, you just head him out into
the snow and he'll just quit bucking because snow's too deep, you see.
C 20 page 4
Q: Yeah, yeah.

R: And the roads, they was no fences where we come from. The government owned the
land, you know. Where we come from.
Q: You didn't ...
R: You owned the land as long as you live. And every so many years they re-divide it.
Q: Oh yeah.
R: The ones that died, they'd take them out and the ones that was born, they'd get land.
If you had, if you had four sons, you'd all get land. If you had four daughters, you wouldn't
get no land. See?
Q: So if you had eight daughters and no sons, you were out?
R: You was out of luck.
Q: Of course then the daughters had to quick marry somebody that ...
R: Unless the guy she married had some land, see. But the last time he was there in 1911,
they said, well, they going, they voted the ones that had the land was going to keep it and
the ones that didn't have it, wasn't going to get none: Well, this right away said that the
dead don't eat watermelons, you see.
Q: Oh, that's right.

R: So that's when the rebellion came. The war broke out in 1914, then's when the rebellion
come.
Q: So that's, you started out by washing your clothes. Now, tell me about your house, for
instance. What was it like?
R: The house furniture?
Q: The whole, the house.
C 20 page 5
R: Well, the house would be, say it'd be long enough to put two or three beds in a row. At
least two beds and up to three beds. And if you was well-enough-to-do, you'd have two
rooms. In the middle of the house, you'd have maybe a spot from here to there, and they
call it "fire house." You see, that's where you cooked. And that's where you heated, put the
stuff in for the stoves. You see to heat, heat the house.
Q: To heat. Oh, uh-huh.
R: There wasn't no ashes in the house because that was all out in the fire house. And if
you cook, you done the same thing, you'd have a couple of holes out there where you'd,
big enough to set a kettle on. You'd fire sunflower stems or sunflower roses, whatever.
You didn't burn it out in the weeds like we do and go up in smoke. You'd save that all to
burn, to use. Or cow chips, you know. And the manure, I mean the people had animals,
they used the manure to burn. You see they'd take it in the spring of the year, they'd take it

out behing the village, you know, and put it on the place and then haul water on it and put
the horses on the trump. Trump it until it's mixed fairly good, about that feet deep.
Q: About a foot deep.
R: And then when they got fairly mixed, then they'd flatten it out and then they'd stick it, put
it in cakes about that big.
Q: They had to let it dry a little bit then.
R: A little bit. Then they'd stick it in cakes about so square,
C 20 page 6
And they'd let it lay about two or three days until it got stiff enough that you could handle it.
Q: About a two, two ...
R: Yeah, about a four, about eight inches square or something like that. And then they'd
set that on racks, you know, where the wind could blow through, you know. And when it
got good and dry, they'd haul it into a dry place and that's what they used in the wintertime.
And if you didn't have no stock, you'd have to either buy from somebody or you'd have
to go, like when we was there and my dad bought some of the manure out of the, out of
the sheep pen, you know, where they take the sheep out there in the summertime, in the
daytime they'd take them out, and in the winter, in the night time they'd bring them in the
village, you know, to put them in the corral so that the coyotes, the wolves don't get them.

See. And then you'd sell that stuff out of there, and you'd pay so much a rod or so much a
foot for it, and that's what you'd burn. Or you go out and pick the cow chips.
Q: Burning the manure like that, that was too bad. They should've, what happened to the
fields, then?
R: Well, I mean they never put no manure on, all the manure they got in the fields, what
when the stock was out, for grazing, that's all. Everything was burned for fuel. Because
people didn't have no wood. There was very little wood. There was wood there, but they
could just allot you a bare little bit. See. That wouldn't even be enough to talk about. You
see.
Q: Well then the fields suffered, but they didn't get the ...
C 20 page 7
R: Well. they raised good stuff when we was there. Of course that's been a long time ago,
you know. See. You take, hell it's 1910, that's been, seventy-some years ago, that's when
we were there. But when we was there, they raised good stuff. You could raise a beet that
big by just carrying a little water on it to start it, and then you'd have no more water. It'd
come from above. You see. And they raise as good a wheat as we do here at dry farming.
In them days, you know. Sometimes they'd have a famine, but when they did have a
famine, the government'd have a granary in the village and they'd loan you the grain and I
mean this government, I mean the czar.
Q: Yeah, not this one.
Library of Congress
Oral history with 85 year old white male, Montrose, Colorado (Transcription) http://www.loc.gov/resource/
afc1986022.afc1986022_ms1804
R: And they would loan you that grain and even to eat. My dad was telling me one time
they had seven years in a row famine, and they didn't grow nothing.
Q: Famine. Famines.
R: Yeah, the government would have soup lines, you see. And so, but when, but my dad
was big, it grew while he was there. Of course he was a young man when he come here.
Q: Did you ever sow two grains in a field? I remember seeing somewhere ...
R: In one year, you mean?
Q: Well, like peas and rye.
R: Well rye, the rye is planted in the fall. And they, that rye, they don't feed the rye straw,
that's what they put on the roofs. When they put a straw roof on, they cut the rye with a
C 20 page 8
cradle. You know they cut it right to the ground.
Q: With a scythe?
R: Well, a cradle they called it. You call it a cradle here. Over there it's a (unintelligible),
you know, German.

afc1986022.afc1986022_ms1804
Q: Reff.
R: Yeah. Cradle in English.
Q: Oh, oh.
R: And they just cut that close to the ground, and hell, they could make a seven-foot swath
with that cradle.
O: then did you tie the ...
R: They'd tie it with rye straw. See?
R: You gathered it up in a bunch and ...
R: Well, I mean they made, they made a rake out of wood. And the rake'd be about that,
that long, you know.
Q: Three four feet?
R: It's wood, and they had teeth about that long in it, you see.
Q: About six inches long?
Library of Congress
Oral history with 85 year old white male, Montrose, Colorado (Transcription) http://www.loc.gov/resource/
afc1986022.afc1986022_ms1804
R: About six inches long. And then the women and the men that didn't have nothing to do,
some people had a machine to cut it with, but a lot of us cut by the cradle. But then the
women come along and have this rye straw tied together on the ears, you know. Have it
stuck on their belts, you know, and when they'd get a big bundle, they'd make bundles like
that over there, they don't make little bundles like they did here, you know. And then that's
what, and then when, what they mowed in the daytime, like the
C 20 page 9
people scythed by hand, like they done for money. Moonlight, they'd shock it.
Q: They'd pick it up in ...
R: In shocks.
Q: When they tied the shocks together, are they ...
R: Bundles?
Q: Bundles.
R: They just twisted like that and shoved it in. To keep it from coming apart.
Q: They'd make sort of a rope out of it and twist it.

afc1986022.afc1986022_ms1804
R: Well, I mean it was maybe about thick, that thick, you know. But that rye straw was
really, they'd wet the straw, you see, before they'd tie it together.
Q: Oh. Oh.
R: You see. And that stuff was pretty, pretty strong. And that's what they used to make
roofs out of, that's rye straw. But the rye straw, they used to burn, too. You didn't feed it
because stock wouldn't eat it, and they used that to heat. If you was a poor guy and you
knew somebody in the village who was well-off, why he'd give you some straw. He would
get you a bundle of straw to heat your house with.
Q: Yeah?
R: And they'd build a fire once a day. And then if you want to bake bread, your rake the
ashes out and put your bread in and bake your bread.
Q: But, burning straw, I remember, did you have thrashing machines, or how did you
thrash?
