Humpty Dumpty. 
Am— " 
The Cork Leg." 
BY II. L. WILLIAMS. 
There was a 
young chap in the Bowe-rie 
Who thouolit in Broadway his luck ho would try : 
So bidding farewell, he " cut his stick," 
And his shingle stuck up at the 0-lym-pic. 
CHORUS. 
Singing, Humpty Dumpty, Dumpty dum, 
liumpty Dumpty, dum. 
Now this ere chap— whose name it was Fax— 
Took hold of Dame Fortune's twisted locks— 
He caught her where " the liar was short," 
And .prepared to show New"Yorkers sport. 
Singing, &c. 
Now 0. K. Hall he furnished the rhyme, 
While Fox he furnished the pantomime, 
So they mixed up dancing and everything nice— 
And even got up a " big thing on ice !" 
Singing, &c. 
The Massacres in Syria. 
Full of thrilling details, and more thrilling pictures.

There are lots of girls, just like so many Eves— 
Who forget in their hurry to put on fig leaves— 
Who in short are such glorious and lovely young 
witches, 
We hope they will ne'er take to wearing the 
breeches. 
Singing, &c. 
There's a 
plump gushing girl who in air seems to 
float, 
With a 
diamond necklace and no petticoat— 
And sweet singers in tights, and fair dancers in 
lawn, 
Who looks as if' all their good duds were in pawn! 
Singing, &c. 
And there's the lair Betty—that's surnamed the 
Ri g'1— 
(Where did she get a name rhyming only with 
wiggle?) 
Unless 'tis to prove Shakspear's meaning complete, 
Call a 
rose what you please, it will ever be sweet. 
Singing, ,t,c. 
And there's G. L Fox, that beats every clown— 
Grimaldkor Ravel, of funny renown— 
Who by antics so comic—so odd a 
grimace, 
Would make e'en a 
Deacon put on a 
gay face. 
Singing, &c. 
And there's Charley, his brother, another queer 
cuss, 
That never is quiet but when in a 
muss; 
There's the odd little donkey—whose nice little 
part, 
Is to bring on two clowns in a 
little go-cart. 
Singing, &c.

Paul was the Prince of Highwaymen—the best man in his trade.

There's a 
dear little singer that plays a 
gay spark— 
And trills like a 
nightingale out for a 
lark! 
Who warbles as sweetly as if bees had kissed 
her— 
One would like to have just such a 
gal for a— 
sister. 
Singing, &c. 
There's the graceful Sangalli— the Goddess of 
Dance— 
With limbs like Diana, and joy in each glance— 
Who leaps o'er Black Crooks—bounds like a 
White 
Fawn— 
And might pass for Aurora unveiling the Dawn 
Singing, &c. 
But more splendid than all 
is the Valley of 
Ferns— 
Where naiades and houris and cupids—by turns— 
Attract every eye to their beautiful form— 
And " bring down the house" in a 
regular storm. 
Singing, &c. 
Under the Gaslight. 
OR, POOR LITTLE LAURA. 
Under the gas-light, while the snow falls, 
And the chill night-wind wearily calls :— 
When the lone beggar creeps to his shed, 
And the rich miser lies in his bed— 
Hear Little Laura making her moan, 
Poor little orphan- child weeping alone— 
" 
Pity me, stranger, help me I 
pray, 
Father and Mother have sent me away 1" 
Under the gas- light, Laura's asleep, 
While the snow's mantle round her doth creep—

But, in her dreaming, wanders she now 
Where the bright Angels will smooth her fair 
brow. 
Well—for, the life- tide's ebbino• so fast, 
All earthly sufferings soon will be past. 
Under the gas- light, rescue is near! 
Poor Little Laura hush every fear ! 
Kind hands have borne thee, far from the storm,

Through tears, the Future so brightly will shine—

The Sailor's Grave. 
Our bark was far, far from the land,' 
When the fairest of our gallant band 
Grew deadly pale, and waned away 
Like the twilight of an Autumn day. 
We 
had watch'd him through long hours of pain, 
Our cares were great, our hopes in vain, 
Death's stroke he gave no cowards alarm, 
But he smiled, and died in his messmate's arms. 
We had no costly winding-sheet, 
We paced two round shots at his feet ; 
He lays in his hammock as snug and as sound 
As a 
king in his long shroud, marble bound 
We proudly deck'd his funeral ve4, 
With the Starry.Flag upon his breast! 
We gave him this as a 
badge of the brave, 
And, then he was fit for a 
sailor's grave. 
Our voices broke, and hearts turn weak ; 
Oft tears was seen on the brownest cheek ; 
The quiver played on the lips of pride, 
As we lower'd him down the ship's dark side. 
Then a 
splash and a 
plunge, and our task was o'er, 
And the billows rolled as they rolled before, 
And many wild prayers hallow'd the wave, 
And he sank into a 
sailor's grave.

The Yaller Gal That Winked At Tile. 
Your attention I 
ask for a 
while 
To a 
song I'm going to sing you— 
It's about a 
pretty yaller gal I 
met while walking, 
And she threw such a 
glance at me— 
She was pretty and as sweet as a 
flower— 
Such clothes you never did see— 
She'd a 
darling little bonnet with a 
flower-garden 
on it, 
Had the yaller gal that winked at me. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, my! she looked so sweet 
And she dressed so neat, 
With her tilting hoops and pretty little feet, 
As she went skipping along; 
Pretty little yaller 
I 
met while I 
was walking, 
And she threw such a 
glance at me, 
As she skipped across the gutter, 
My heart went in a 
flutter, 
For the yaller gal that winked at me. 
I 
immediately asked her her name, 
And she said it was Lucinda, 
She said I 
was a stunner, and for life that I 
had 
won her, 
And married we should be. 
So I 
dress'd up and I'd walk by her house, 
Every afternoon, about three— 
And I'd glance up at the window, for to see my 
dear Lucinda— 
She's the yaller gal that winked at me. 
Oh, my I 
she, &c. 
Oh i 
you should have seen her, on her wedding 
day— 
She was handsome as a 
Venus—

Dark and Roguish Eye. 
We 
all do like the pretty girls, 
We see them day by day— 
And how at first sight fall in love, 
When e'er they pass that way ! 
But a 
charming girl, the other morn,.. 
I 
saw come walking by, 
And, as she gazed, I 
saw she bad] 
A 
dark and roguish eye. 
CHORUS. 
I 
never can forget her— 
The first time that I 
met her : 
And, as I 
looked, my fate was booked, - 
I 
sealed it with a 
si!-rh— 
I 
found that I 
had fell in love 
With a 
dark and roguish eye. 
Her dress was in the fashion cut, 
Hooped up so gay and neat— 
And as she went to cross the way,1 
I 
saw her pretty feet. 
By chance she dropped her handkerchief, 
'Twas marked; L- u-c-y; 
I 
picked it up, she thanked me with, 
A dark and roguish eye.

He lately had struck ILE.

Upon the school- house playing ground, which 
sheltered you and me ; 
But none are left to greet me, Tom, and few are

now 
That played with us upon the green, just Twenty 
Years Ago. 
The grass is just as green, dear Tom; bare-footed 
boys, at play, 
Are sportiwr just as we were then, with spirits 
just as gay ; 
But master sleeps upon the bill, all coated o'er with 
snow, 
That afforded us a 
sliding-place, just Twenty Years 
Ago. 
The old school-house is altered some, the benches 
are replaced 
By new ones, very like the same our pen-knives 
had defaced ; 
But the same old bricks are in the wall, the bell 
swings to and fro, 
The music just the same, dear Tom, ' twas Twenty

The boys are playing some old game, beneath that 
same old tree, 
I 
do forget the name. just now—you have played 
the same with me ; 
On that same spot, 'twas played with knives, by 
throwing so and so, 
The leaders had a 
task to do there, Twenty Years 
ago. 
The river is running just as still— the willows on 
its side, 
Are larger than they were, dear Tom, the stream 
appears less wide ; 
The grape- vine swin ,r 
is ruined now, where once 
we played the beau, 
And swung our sweet hearts, pretty girls, just 
Twenty Years Ago. 
The spring that bubbled 'neath the bill, close by the 
spreading beach, 
Is very high—'twas once so low that we could 
almost reach ; 
But in kneeling down to get a 
drink, dear Tom, I 
started so, 
To see how sadly I 
am changed since Twenty 
Years Ago. 
Down by the spring, upon an elm, you know, I 
cut 
your name— 
Your sweetheart's just beneath it, Tom—and you 
did mine the same ; 
Some heartless wretch has peeled the bark—'twas 
dying sure. but slow, 
Just as the one whose name you cut did, Twenty 
Years Ago.

come in my eyes:

loved so well—those early 
broken ties ;

Years Ago. 
Some are in the church-yard laid, some sleep

But few are left of our old class, expecting you and 
me ; 
But when our time shall come, dear Tom, and we

And which shar'd without complaining, 
All the ills my bosom knew ; 
It was thine, my gentle Mary, 
Thou wert all the world to me, 
And, however fortune vary, 
I 
will still be true to thee. 
Thou wert dear to me in childhood; 
When the rosebud on its tree, 
As it blossom's on the wild wood, 
Was an emblem, love, of thee. 
In thy youth thou wert still dearer ; 
With the dawn of reason came, 
Thoughts that brought thee to me nearer, 
Tho' they bore not yet love's name : 
But thy womanhood unfolding,

As nice a

Her hair was red, her eyes were blue, 
Her dreadful end I'll tell to you.

And left his red hair'd wife at home, 
With strict injunctions ne'er to roam, 
But of course at times she out would pop, 
To get some bread at the Baker's Shop, 
And the Baker a

He threw sheep's eyes at the Clam-man's wife.

And that put an enI to the Clam-man's wife. 
Now when he found she was no more, 
With grief he like a

Thc Fate of Poor Dog Tray. 
But unless my watch is fast, 
The morning time has past, 
To sing of the dawn its too late in the day, 
Yet I've tried a 
change of air, 
Almost more than I 
can bear, 
It minds me of my Old Dog Tray. 
Old Dog Tray is ever faithful, 
Grief come upon him one day, 
For the Government hacks, 
Would insist upon the tax, 
Which was fatal to my Old Dog Tray. 
Old Dog Tray, &c. 
He was very good at rats, 
And a 
mortal foe to cats, 
We were more like brothers then I 
care to say, 
But five dollars every year, 
For his company was dear, 
And there's no•hing left of Old Dog Tray. 
Old Dog Tray had a 
plateful 
Of bones and potatoes one fine day, 
And inside the sav'ry mass hid, 
Was a 
dose of prussid acid, 
Which made an end of Old Dog Tray. 
Old Dog Tray, &c. 
They bore him from my sight, 
For it overcame me quite,

was ill I 
was wretched, I 
was wasting away, 
From my food I

And my dinner 'beer I 
spurned,

Over the waves went they, 
For a

Came on her trackless way ; 
Th"y saw afar, each tap'rino- spar, 
Of a

Too fragile were for the tempest there, 
And rent by the storm's rude gales. 
Then cheer for the Pilots, whoever you be, 
Who have anxiously watch'd for a 
friend on the

The storm rag'd high, and the rocks were nigh, 
But the Pilot's hark was driven 
Far, far, aback from the vessel's track, 
Which they to reach had striven ; 
And darkness came—save when the flame 
Of the vivid lightnin r threw 
A light that bore, to their friends on shore, 
The ship—but no Pilot's crew. 
Then cheer for the Pilots, Sze. 
The storm was o'er, and a 
calm, once more, 
-Was over the sea and sky, 
The ships, with the tide, in the harbour glide, 
But no Pilots' btrque was nigh ! 
A mariner's form, 'mid the wrecks of the storm, 
Was seen on the ebbing wave, 
Its pulse was cold, and a 
tale it told— 
That the deep was the Pilot's grave. 
Then cheer for the Pilots, whoever you be, 
Who brave even death, for our friends on the sea.

The old Garden Gate. 
One even, Dame Gray, at her own cottage door, 
Sat watching the pathway that leads up the moor, 
For Ellen, her darling, had gone to the fair, 
And the Dame couldn't fancy what ' twos kept her 
there, 
While deep were the shadows the sunset had flung 
And the Dame had forgotten what she did when 
young, 
She waited and wonder'd why Nelly was late, 
And long'd for the click of the old garden gate. 
Now had she but look'd up the path oil the hill, 
There Nelly was coining, with Hal of the mill ; 
.Not hurrying homeward, I'm sorry to say, 
But loitering, sadly, the rest of the way— 
In converse so earnest, with gesture and tone, 
As if they two made up the whoie world alone ; 
And still they would linger, altho' it was late,

There's None Like a Mother. 
Air :—" Cottage and Water Mill." 
You tell me you love me, I 
fain would believe, 
And will make me your own bride and never de-
ceive; 
You offer to me your heart and your hand, 
And make me the mistress of houses and land. 
I 
am but a 
poor girl, the truth I 
will tell : 
My mother's a 
widow, in yon cottage cloth dwell, 
She who nursed me in sickness, with little in store, 
Now I'll never desert her, because she is poor.. 
You have promised me servants, and carriage so 
gay, 
And perhaps to deceive me and lead me astray, 
For some men they will flatter,' to destroy a 
girl's 
name. 
And soon she's reduced to a 
sad life of shame; 
And ten she's insulted by each passer by, 
Her life is a 
burden, she could lay down and die. 
While here I 
ant contented by our own cottage 
door, 
There's none like a 
mother, if ever so poor. 
My dear father's words still ring in my ear, 
When dying, he bade me my Maker to fear, 
And be kind to my another from her never part, 
If I 
were to leave her, it would break her heart. 
Still if we were to marry I 
should lead a 
sad life, 
When your friends that are rich, knew you'd got 
a 
poor wife; 
Your parents might slight me, it has been so before, 
I'll not leave any mother, altho' she is poor. 
But if I 
were your equal, with wealth to command 
I'd willingly give you my heart and my hand, 
And sooth every sorrow, dispel every care. 
For there's truth in your face, I 
believe you're 
sincere.

Some time ago, 
where'r I 
strayed, I 
heard the 
observation made, 
To which I 
close attention paid—' how very, stout 
you're getting." 
Said one " Amt. me, you waddle quite ! you bid fair 
to become a 
fright 
Another said, " You're such a 
sight! you're like a 
bladder blown out tight 
And only see, where'er you go, how you're compel-
led to puff and blow, 
You surely soon will burst your do' if you don't 
follow Banting."

Humpty Dumpty Songster. 
At these remarks I 
took affright and so resolved 
that very night 
I'd put myself at once on diet, and try this wondrous 
Banting. 
A plan straightway I 
undertook and though my 
appetite it shook, 
Immediately I 
sacked my cook, and sent at once 
and bought his book; 
I 
left off milk and cut my bread, no more with 
butter was it spread,— 
By weight and measure drank and fed, in deference 
to Banting. 
My ruddy face soon grew so pale,—.a 
fact I 
really must bewail— 
Alack, but thereby hangs a 
tale—that all 
grew out of Banting. 
Ere this reducing I 
essayed, I 
wooed a 
very charm-
ing maid, 
Who tried her utmost to persuade me not to follow 
Banting. 
! 
pray your lovely fat retain, she pleaded in a 
tender strain ; 
I 
on my knees fell to restrain, with struggles I 
arose again— 
An argument's before your eyes—some of this 
flesh I'll sacrifice— 
I 
can't arise I'm such a 
size, I 
really must try 
Banting. 
Well then, if you a 
Banting be, I 
will forbid 
the banns, quoth she ; 
I 
hate thin men, you're lost to me if you per-
sist in Banting. 
And now I've grown so spare and lean, she tells me 
I 
look lank and mead"— 
Oh: why was I 
so jolly green—extremes to go in

Red Head Sal. 
If you'll listen to me, a 
tale I'll relate, 
About Pickled Eel Bob, and a false-hearted mate, 
And how he's been served by a 
fickle-minded gal, 
She was known by the name of Red Head Sal. 
With her fol the rol and her flaxen hair, 
She was a 
beauty, I 
do dt dare ; 
She lived in the Bowery and sold sage, 
And sweet seventeen was just her age. 
As Bob was going to market one day, 
For a 
peck or two of eels his barrow to adorn, 
When all of a 
sudden, why, who should he see, 
But this pretty little Sally tripping up to ne. 
My dearest Sarah, Bob to her did say, 
Have you made up your mind to name the day ; 
She said—oh, Bob, don't talk such stuff, 
You know mother says there's time enough. 
At last Sarah said—if you will me bring, 
A 
nice satin dress and a 
large gold ring, 
I'll ask my mother to give her consent, 
Bob said he would, and and away he went.

Sarah went to her mother and to her did say, 
Pickled Eel Bob wants me tonatne the day : 
You sled I 
have my cousent—'twill be a 
good job, 
To get you married to Pickled Eel Bob. 
Now a 
rival Bob had, lie played well his part, 
He used to sell sand with a 
mule and cart ; 
Bob had often heard Sarah with him crack a 
joke, 
And sometimes he'd give her a 
ride on the moke. 
But now comes the worse of a 
very bad job, 
Strait got married, but it wasn't to Bob, 
lie's a 
poor lost man, and his heart never heals, 
To hear Sarah singing—Eels, here's pickled eels. 
Sarah wrote Bob a 
letter and to him did say, 
I 
wish from my husband I 
was away ; 
I 
love you the best, but the truth must be spoke, 
I 
only married him for the sake of the moke.

Well, her favourite band had four boys and a 
man, 
They play'd all the afternoon. 
The French horn was in C, and the flageolet 
in G, 
And the rest of them all out of tune, 
Amid this awful row there was somehow. 
One who won the heart of Susannah, 
Who stood latio-hing at the window, while the 
Germin flageolet, 
Winked at her in the most reckless manner. 
I

Proceedings like that you knew are not right, 
And so indeed I 
told her;

But I 
was loth to scold her.

Says he, " what is your property, though lucre I 
despise, 
But we cannot live on nothing, which to try 
would not be wise, 
We've both on us got appetites, which satisfied 
must be, 
And we can't have proper dinners if we haint got 
proper tea." 
Says she, " oh, James, you've called me oft my 
beautiful, my hown, 
And said as how you did adore me, for myself 
alone !" 
I 
give thee all I 
can, no more, as says one of the 
songs, 
I've got fifty dollars, a 
silver watch, and a 
pair of 
sugar tongs. 
Says he, " taint much considering, how much pur-
visions riz, 
But we'll be married next Sunday three weeks as 
ever is ; 
The sweets of matrimony will improve life's bitter 
cup, 
Some folks would put down Sunday bands, I'll go 
and put ours up. 
The three weeks passed like lightning, time ran 
on rapid wheels, 
And James called on her hevry day, and hal ways 
had his meals. 
At last the happy day did come, a 
select partee of 
five 
Set trembling in the vestry, but, her James did not 
arrive. 
Says she, " why don't he come, oh dear, I 
thought 
to me he'd rush, 
I'm much afraid he's been run over by a 
homble-
bush ; 
When some one handed in a 
letter to the trembling 
bride,

" 
Farewell, for I 
was not aware when first your 
form I 
saw, 
That you was thirty-four, you should have told me 
that afore 
I've spent your tin, I've sold the watch, the sugar 
tongs I've spouted, 
You'd have been dear, love, at the price, and so that 
is all about it." 
Now at this sad intelligence, the friends did jeer 
and scoff, 
How Susian poor thing went on, and then poor 
thing went off; 
They all left bride likewise bridesmaids, the clerk 
also the minister, 
And as for Susian poor dear, why she is still a 
spinster.

One night to his home he wended his way, 
He'd been out slaughtering sheep all the day, 
When he got to his door he guy a

For there all in white stood the ghost of his

He lifted the latch, and he stepped inside— 
There stood his father with his mouth open wide, 
He'd taken some Thorley's food for Cattle, 
And ten minutes arter he guy his death rattle. 
But Oh, &c. 
Of course he was frightened out of his life, 
When he suddenly heard a 
shriek from his wife, 
He rushed to her room—but too late !— for rum, 
By mistake, she had taken Col-chi-cum! 
That very same night his two little boys, 
Both died through licking the paint off their toys, 
While their poor old nurse, in despair through a 
sin, 
Went off—Just so 1—on a 
quart of gin.

I'm not seeking You. 
As I 
was walking out one day, 
I 
met a 
charming blade, 
Says he to me why out alone, 
And sucn a 
smiling maid. 
My heart then filled with fright, I'm sure,

could do,

I 
am not seeking you

was, &c.

hung my head and sigh'd ; 
He took me by the hand and said, 
Will you be my bride ?

own, 
And thought what can I 
do, 
I 
said, pray, sir, leave me alone, 
I 
ani not seeking you. 
As I 
was, &c. 
Still more terror o'er me stole, 
I 
sinking faintly cried, 
I 
wish I 
was at home once more, 
And by my mother's side.

do ? 
I 
said, pray sir, begone from me,

Plain sailing to his port, the heart, 
He knows no jealous folly ; 
'Tis hard enough at sea to war 
With boisterous elements that jar

Clouds frown, and angry billows roar, 
Still is he brisk and jolly : 
And while carousing with his mates, 
Her health he drinks— anticipates

I 
once went courting a 
lady, 
She went by the name of Jane Bell, 
All others Jane sure she'd surpass, 
The truth unto you I 
will tell. 
Ve ,retarians they say, is all my eye, 
But to purchase meat Jane had'nt the means, 
But when she went to market she'd buy 
About eight or nine bunches of greens.

For her breakfast she'd take watercresses, 
For her dinner have flour and beans, 
For her tea she'd take mustard and cress, 
And for her supper take nothing but greens. 
We went for a 
walk the other day, 
The weather it being very fine, 
We stopped in a 
field on our way, 
Aril there we sat down to dine. 
In lier basket she'd brought a 
nice cake, 
All you lovers take this as a

But inst 4L.1 of eating the cake, 
She had a

She was a

If she wanted to look well and get fat, 
Ric inust take meat in a 
moderate way. 
It's true she had a 
good apetite, 
Tie envy of kia•rs and queens, 
She'd often wake up in the night, 
And begin to sing out for her greens.

She was fond of everything that was green, 
She drank nothing else but green tea,

'Till at length he one morning was bowled out 
quite clean, 
When he chopped up a. man in his Sausage 
Machine. 
Mr. Grabetn, an officer, once to him went, 
With a 
writ that the Sheriff had issued for rent, 
Bone sharpened his knife and said with a 
grin, 
" 
Are you quite sure tnat noho,iy saw you come 
in ?" 
Mr, Grahem said, " Yes." 
Then said Bone with a 
shoot, 
" 
I'll take deuced good care no one sees you come 
out." 
Then he, with a 
sharp knife, Grabem's head cut off 
clean, 
And then flung him into the Sausage Machine! 
In a 
very few moments poor Grabem was ground 
Into savoury sausages, four- ' woe., a 
pound, 
Bone flavoured hint up with pepper and spice, 
The customers thought that they steel very nice, 
And hundreds that day helped poor Grabem to eat, 
And a 
luxury thought it to get such a 
treat, 
And at eight o'clock made into hot pork pies, 
He, with baked beaus made a 
good supper for boys. 
No one need have known what di,1 Grabem befall, 
Had not Bone, like a 
flat, chopped him up clothes 
and all ; 
Some folks went back to him and said, very wroth, 
" 
I 
never knew sausages were made out of cloth !" 
While others did say, " He was worse than a 
brute, 
To imagine that they could disgest an old boot," 
Said they, " They're nought else but brace buttons 
an.i rags, 
No wonder that folks call 'em Mystery bags'."

It must have been instinct by which he could tell, 
He the sausages eyed as if he knew them well. 
He purchased a 
pound and them home with him 
took, 
But he thought he'd dissect them, before he'd 
them cook, 
And the very first one that he laid on his plate, 
Was enough to convince him of poor Grabem's 
fate. 
From the sausage he drew, with a 
terrible frown, 
The writ that poor Grabem had taken to Bone, 
While out from another, a 
portion be took, 
Of the hand he so often in friendship had shook. 
He, to Bone's, like a 
man of his senses bereft, 
Went and seized all the sausages he had got left, 
But Bone, ' stead of standing it out like a 
brick, 
Hung himself to a 
hook, and the bucket did kick. 
Twelve Jurymen then on the sausages sat, 
And this was the verdict they did arrive at, 
" 
We find Mr. Grabem has been chopped up clean, 
By being thrown into a 
Sausage Machine, 
And as prime beef sausages has been purveyed, 
And the purchasers' thus have been cannibals 
made." 
When you're sausages eating, you'll oft think I 
ween, 
Of poor Grabem's fate, and the Sausage Machine.

There was a 
young man lived in Harloam town, 
Vermicelli washis maiden name, 
He got tired of living a 
country life, 
And he wasn't very much to blame. 
Oh! lie emigrated down to this here town, 
The fountain of all wealth, 
And he measured out tape in a 
dry goods chop, 
Which wasn't very good for his health. 
Oh! he fell in love with a 
sweet young dove, 
Her name it was Joanna; 
She wore a 
magnolious crinoline, 
And she punished the grand pianner. 
Oh! he took her to Coney Island on the ferry boat, 
And fed her on strawberries and cream, 
She was chief engineer in a 
milliner's chop, 
And boss of a 
sewing machine. 
There was a 
photographic man lived opposite her 
house, 
And he tried her cruel heart for to soften, 
And he won her young aff ctions away, 
By taking her picture for noffin', 
When the draper's clerk came to hear of this, 
Out of him it took the shine ; 
He pack'd his clothes in a 
cigar-box, and bought

through ticket, 
And Baird for Melbourne on the Black Ball line.

The Last Adieu. 
Farewell, dearest! fare thee well, and blessings 
with thee go, 
May sunshine be upon thy path, and flowers

Farewell, dearest! &c. 
Farewell, dearest! still I

sigh ; 
Once more thy hand is pressed in mine, once more 
I 
feel its spell, 
Oh give me but one sunny smile, then dearest fare 
thee well!

Thus cruelly to part, my Katy ? 
Is this thy faithful swain's reward— 
An aching, broken heart, my Katy ?

Canst thou leave me thus, my Katy ? 
Canst thou leave me thus, my Katy ? 
Well thou knowest my aching heart.

Farewell! and ne'er such sorrows tear 
That fickle heart of thine, my Katy I 
Thou may-'st find those will love thee dear— 
But not a

Scenes that are Brightest. 
Scenes that are brightest 
May charm, awhile, 
Hearts which are lightest. 
And eyes that smile; 
Yet o'er them, above us. 
Though nature beam, 
With none to love us, 
How sad they seem. 
Words cannot scatter 
The thoughts we fear 
For, though they flatter, 
They mock the ear: 
no-es still deceive us 
With tearful cost, 
And when they leave us, 
The heart is lost.

enclosed in a handsome cover, with an illustrated engraving 
and sold 
at the remarkably low price of TEN CENTS. 
..Vo. 1. The .Denzon of the Desert. 
This book is one of the most powerfully 
exciting 
novels 
ever written. 
The 
scenes are laid in the land of the rifle, 
the tomahawk and the scalping-knife, 
Terrible 
adventures crimson almost 
every page. 
No. 2. Prairie Pete; or, The 
Trapper's Avenger. 
Of all the tales of 
wild adventure in forest and prairie 
this Is the most excellent. The reader 
seems to actuilly hear the yell of the 
demon red- skins, sees 
their painted 
faces, 
puenesses the lurid flames of 
the frontier log cabin. 
No. 3. Wild Bill, the Indian, 
Slayer. Wild Bill, who is anInveter-
ate hater of the Indians. 
He never 
walks out of the house without a 
brace 
of fine revolvers slung to his waist, and 
woe to the Indians that cross his path. 
No. 4. The Death Trail. 
Vividly 
arc these pages filled with the doings of 
the terrible Regulators of Arkansas. 
Some of these incidents are fearfully 
terrific, such as the vigil of the Indian 
by the corpse of his wife, and his awful 
revenge upon her slayer, in the mined 
wigwam. 
No. 5. Grey-Eyed Luke. Every 
page of this thrilling book is ful I 
of in - 
cident. 
Tne characters are natural. 
the actions life- like and full of daring. 
The hot sun of Sonora fills their veins 
and excites them to deeds of despera-
tion. No book of its class can begin to 
compare with it. 
No. G. Six- Shooter Jim. This 
book will find readers as long as there 
exists a 
taste for the wild, the terrible, 
and the sanguinary. It is a 
truthful 
picture of real life as it exists upon the 
frontiers where the revolver, meets the 
rifle, the tomahawk and scalping knife. 
No. 7. The Wrecker's Victim. 
This Story is terribly interesting. The 
daughter of the iron- hearted smuggler 
and the wrecker is one of the loveliest 
maidens that ever pressed foot on sea.. 
sand. Her admirers were many among 
the ruffians that surround her—ruffians 
more cruel than the awful waves that 
dash on the wreck-strewn shore by 
which she lives. 
feso, 
No. S. The Storm. Child. wrie 
dark caverns that honey-comb the storm 
lashed rohores of Cornwall witness terri-
ble crimes in their recesses. 
Smugglers, 
aye, and red-handed pirates, are the ac-
tors who seek by the fiercest means to 
perpetrate terrible and unholy crimes. 
[ovxn. ] 
De Witt's Ten Cent Romances continued. 
No. 9. Captain Bob, the Moun-
tain Devil. A 
few years ago there 
dwelt in the almost impenetrable reces-
ses of the Ozark Mountains, a 
wretch 
whose name was a 
terror to the inhabi-
tants of the surrounding region. With 
his band of outlaws, Indians and cut-
t 
hroats, he made raids upon the outlying 
plantations, plundered them, and, if op-
position were attempted, arson and mur-
der were added to the other dark deeds. 
No. 10. Wild Bill's _First Trail. 
I. a 
plain recital of the first of the many 
adventures in which this daring Indian 
Fighter, Buffalo Hunter, Trapper and 
Union Guide, was an actor. The story 
is told by himself, and is very entertain 
ing. 
No. 11. Sam Sutton, the Scalp 
Taker. In this bock figure many of 
the Indians who are now making the 
Great Plains a " dark and bloody 
ground." Sam will be readily recogniz-
ed as a 
real character by all our officers 
who have been stationed in the Indian 
country. 
No. 12. The Crawling Snake. 
This famous Scout and Indian Scalper 
went for ahead of the most cunning In-
dian,. in tricks and stratagems. 
He 
could crawl right through the best 
watched camp, and knife an Indian in 
the heart of his encampment. 
No. 13. Big .Lige; or, The Red 
Cloud of the Soshones. The best of good 
stories. 
It tells of a 
young hunter who

his blessing and his rifle. When he 
himself is attacked Big Lige comes to 
his aid.

Scout 
with the eye of a 
hawk and a 
heart of 
steel—with a 
wit keen as his scalping-
knife. 
A love story runs its silver 
cord through the blood-stained tissue. 
No. 15. leatherskin; or, The 
Prairie Guide. This well-hnown Scout 
was an odd mixture of Kit Carson and 
Old Adams the grizzly-tamer; and 
could out-ride, out-shoot and out-fight 
the tallest red-skin that ever took a 
white man's scalp. 
No. 16. Black-Beard. This fero-
cious pirate, who seemed to love crime 
for its own sake, was one oi the most 
skillful sailors that ever took his " trick 
at the helm;" and his terrible deeds are 
listened to with a 
strange interest in the 
folcastle, when the wind is " blowing 
great guns." 
No. 17. Adelaide, the Avenger. 
How a 
young, lovely and innocent giri, 
followed the fortunes of a 
black-hearted 
corsair, ( seeking to avenge the wrongs 
inflicted on her lover) is fully told in 
theso pages. Amid toe hushed calm or 
the fearful storm, the fair girl follows 
the wretch like the figure of doom. 
No. 18. Old Pike, the Indian 
Trader. Cobb, Robinson an i 
Ben-
nett sem to have united all their skit i,. 
producing this most capital Indiao 
story

of the first—the fidelity of the second, 
and the fluency or. the third. 
It is mar-
vellously well told and true to life.

Spectre of the Swamp. Fearfully inter-
esting are the strange scenes in this book.
