I was interested in interviewing Karen Pelletier because she is a female who owns a 
barbershop with a predominately female staff. Her barbershop is located on a tree-
lined street in the small, quaint town of Georgetown, Massachusetts. It looks like it’s 
straight out of a Norman Rockwell painting. 
 
We arrived at Karen’s Barbershop at 10am. The barbershop is spacious, bright and 
clean. At the time no one else was in the shop except Pelletier’s staff and her 
client/hair model. He was sitting in the chair ready to go. I set up the tripod and 
starting shooting. Karen is very efficient and precise with her barbering skills. She 
cut her client’s hair and shaved the back of his neck with a straight razor. 
 
After her client left, we went to the back room to do the interview. Once we started 
the interview her employee’s customers arrived in the shop. We had to stop the tape 
a few times because of the noise from the vacuum and customer noise. At one point 
a little boy was whistling in the chair, again reminiscent of a Norman Rockwell 
experience.  
 
Initially Pelletier was all business but once we settled into the interview, she warmed 
up and shared her story about becoming a female barber in a conservative town that 
values tradition. During the interview I mentioned that I may have to pause the 
interview for a minute to feed the parking meter outside, and she assured me that 
“they don’t ticket here.” After being in New York, Washington and Boston, I knew we 
were in a different place. We finished the interview and left around 12:30pm.
