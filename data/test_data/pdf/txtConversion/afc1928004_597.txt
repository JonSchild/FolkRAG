Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1881, by A  J. 
FISHER, in the office of the Librarian of Congress, at 
Washington, D. C. 
Words and Music by JOHN McVEtou, and originally sung by 
JOHN MCVEIGH & M ISS KATE MONTROSE in their great 
Character Sketch, entitled "Spirits Frumenti." 
The Arions gave a 
ball last night, 
And didn't we have fun; 
Two Germans played on clarionetts, 
And a 
Frenchman beat the drum; 
A Colored man with a 
tambourine, 
And a 
Jew with a 
big trombone; 
W hile a 
Chinaman he beat a 
gong, 
To give the band a 
tone. 
All the ladies were a 
singing, 
Merry, happy, light; 
And the music was a 
ringing, 
At the Anion ball last night. 
CHORUS: 
All cross bands, balance to your partners, 
Forward four, here the leader call; 
All promenade, salute your partners, 
At the Anion festive ball. 
Susie Summerfield she was there, 
I 
tell you she looked neat; 
She raised the dust up to the roof, 
With her eighteen carat feet; 
Miss Mollie Williams, too, was there, 
I 
thought her heart would break; 
For the bell of the ball was Lizzie Hall, 
Who carried off the cake. 
All the ladies were a 
singing, 
Merry, happy, light; 
And the music was a 
ringing, 
At the Anion ball last night.

THE HEATHEN CHINESE. 
Written and sung by JOHN M CVEIGH with great success. 
The Chinese in this country, 
Are getting awful thick; 
With long pig tails down back, 
Complexions like a 
brick; 
They cheat the poor washerwoman, 
Because they work for cheaper price; 
It doesn't cost them much to live, 
They eat onions, rats and mice. 
CHORUS: 
Hi, yi, ki, citing, chang, chang, 
When you get a 
Chinaman, kill him if you call; 
Kill him with a 
razor, stab him with a 
brick, 
Then you're sure to settle a 
Chinaman. 
They wear their shirts outside their pants, 
'Cause they're got no coats; 
They shave their hair all off in front, 
They look like Wm. Goats; 
The men and women look alike, 
As all of you do know; 
They're a 
mixture of a 
bull dog, 
A wolf and kangaroo. 
(Chorus). 
May the man who brought them to this country, 
Be stung to death with flies; 
May mosquitos bore a 
hole through him, 
May boot-blacks bang his eyes; 
May Old Nick come after him some day, 
And take him down below ; 
May a 
pig tail grow on the end of his nose, 
By the Jerry, Jehosophat Joe, 
(Chorus), 
• 
I 
CAN'T EXACTLY SAY. 
Written by Jolts- 111cATEIGH for M ISS KATE M ONTROSE. 
I 
feel in love with a 
nice young man, 
his name was Alonzo Blanc; 
Of me he was fond, he's a 
strawberry blonde, 
fie completely has turned my brain; 
lie took me out to many a 
ball, 
And every evening used to call; 
II3 asked me if I'd marry him some day, 
I 
answered r 
couldn't exactly say. 
Ghortts.—I couldn't exactly say, I 
couldn't exactly say, 
Perhaps I 
will, perhaps I 
won't, 
But now I 
cannot inform you; 
Say no, I 
never could do, 
To say yes might not be true; 
So I 
think it best to let it rest, 
For I 
couldn't exactly say. 
One night he came to visit me, 
And my father had gone to bed; 
When he talked so loud that the old man heard 
Mo,:t every word he said; 
He wanted me with him to elope, 
But just at that time the old man awoke; 
Did Alonzo get hurt, you ask me, elm? 
Well, now, I 
couldn't exactly say. 
SPOKEN. — I 
know that Alonzo has been very sick in his 
room ever since. 
Some people say that the mark of a 
No. 
10 boot is on his best Sunday pants, but whether it is or 
not, why— ( Chorus). 
I 
want to find a 
nice young man, 
lie mustn't be very old; 
And handsome, too, with a 
black mustache, 
And plenty of stamps and gold; 
I'll marry him and make agood wife, 
And bless his present and future life; 
And spend all his money, did you say? 
Well, now, I 
couldn't exactly say. 
SPOKRN.-4 might manage to get away with eight or ten 
thousand dollars a 
year for silk dresses, and after he got 
broke. I 
might possibly give him the shake, and apply for 
a 
divorce, but whether I 
would or not just at present, why 
(Chorus).

KATE FROM OLD KENTUCK. 
Words and Music by JOHN MCVEIGH. 
Originally sung by MISS KATE MONTROSE. 
----:0:----
My little Kate from old Kentuck, 
I 
love her, oh! so well, 
I 
love her in the morning, noon and night ; 
I 
love her in the evening, 
When the twilight shadows fall, 
I 
love her pretty, blue eyes, bright 
I 
learned to love her years ago, 
And her ways I 
did admire; 
I 
loved her first in school-boy days, 
She did my heart inspire. 
CHORUS: 
My little Kate whom none could hate, 
To win you was my good luck; 
My charming Kate, my pretty Kate, 
My Kate from old Kentuck. 
I 
love her in the spring time. 
When the summer roses bloom, 
I 
love her in the autumn just as well, 
I 
love her in the winter, 
When snow it cloth appear, 
And chilly winds creep round our cosy dell: 
I 
love her for herself alone, 
Far dearer than my life; 
I 
love her for her gentle ways, 
That's why I 
call her wife. 
(Chorus).

MARRIED MEN-GAMBLERS 
End Gag. Written by JOHN MCVEIGH. 
0 :--
When a 
man's single and courting his wife, 
his head like a 
pumpkin is mellow; 
lie curls his mustache and wears a 
silk dice, 
And she calls him a 
dear little fellow. 
At last he tesolves the question to pop, 
There's a 
tickling in his throat like the mumps; 
You can bet that he gambles at that particular time, 
And plays high, too, for hearts are the trumps. 
The honeymoon o'er, comes a 
change o'er the scene, 
On his back like a 
camel there's a 
hump; 
His wife wants a 
new dress, a 
bonnet or shawl, 
lie then finds that diamonds are trumps. 
A month or two later he's not feeling well, 
And his wife's got a 
fit of the dumps; 
A 
dispute here arises, which perhaps ends in blows, 
And if so, why, then, clubs are the trumps. 
But later still, he goes out with the gang, 
And by accident totters home drunk; 
His wife his head with a 
shovel does thump, 
It's easy to see how the game's going now, 
To his sorrow he knows that spades are the trump. 
He then takes a 
seat and tries to keep still, 
But she says that he never did suit her; 
She calls him a 
knave, he can't make a 
point, 
Too late then he finds that its euchre. 
At last he gets rattled, tries to hold out, 
And does all in his power to choke her; 
But she changes the game, it's her favorite, too, 
He gets the worst of it sure, for it's poker. 
She then grabs a 
boot-jack and hits him a 
crack, 
That knocks him over a 
keg; 
It's seven up now, clubs are trumps, she's a 
handful, 
The result is, he's forced to beg. 
The game's finished at last, she finds that he's /
ow, 
And for peace sake admits he's to blame; 
While she crows like a 
rooster and triumphantly cries 
I'm high-boot Jack and the game.

'Twas a 
beautiful day but a 
short time ago, 
I 
met a 
young friend named McKay; 
Says he if you'll come, we'll have lots of fun, 
At our picnic that's going down the bay; 
I 
refused first to go, but he'd not accept no, 
On my going he insisted quite hearty; 
Saying please conic along, you can sing us a 
song, 
And help entertain our small party. 
CHORUS: 
Dancing with the girls and boys, 
Schottische, and waltzing so gay; 
I 
danced so much I 
was really tired. 
At the picnic down the hay. 
The gents were all dressed in suits of the best, 
And the ladies looked happy and light: 
As the boat left the pier, we loudly did cheer, 
It was really a 
beautiful sight; 
Both the old and young had plenty of fun, 
To hear the girls laughing and singing; 
Our joy to enhance, we'd each other outdance, 
While the band its sweet music kept ringitp-

A Beautiful Ballad. • 
-Vritten expressly for Miss KATE M ONTROSE, by FRANK LAVARNIE, 
-cis strange, tho' I 
cannot forget, 
'Twas just one year ago; 
To better lands, tho' far away, 
My little pet did go. 
Tito' cherished with the fondest hopes, 
Her love I 
ne'er could tell; 
Until I 
left her one bright morn, 
It was my last farewell. 
CHORUS: 
Oh, yes, ' twas but a 
year two, 
Her love I 
know it well; 
It seems to me but yesterday, 
I 
took my last farewell. 
She's left this world and gone above, 
With angels to rejoice; 
Where they will welcome her with love, 
On bearing her sweet voice; 
When e'er I 
pass that little cot, 
That stands beside the dell; 
I 
often think of days gone by, 
When I 
took my last farewell. 
Written by JOHN McVEion. 
tiung with great success by Miss KATE MONTROSE. 
A 
simple song I'll sing to you, 
The subject's anything but new; 
But yet I 
trust ' twill please a 
few, 
Perhaps nine out of ten. 
It's meant to suit the grave and gay, 
A 
healthy moral to convey; 
And if you'll follow all I 
say, 
You'll all be happy men. 
To those who feel dispirited, 
I 
merely wish to show; 
The future will be brighter 
If you try and make it so; 
Now if a 
moment you'll allow, 
And pay attention to me now, 
I 
fancy I 
can tell you how 
To be a 
happy man. 
If you are anxious to get well, 
By beauty only don't be led; 
But look for sterling worth instead, 
And find one if you can. 
Whose trust in faith and constancy, 
Will cheer you on life's stormy sea; 
And even in adversity, 
Make you a 
happy man. 
THE WAY TO BE HAPPY. — CoNmoJED. 
Be gentle to each other, 
No matter what intervenes, 
Remember if you want to live, 
To live within your means; 
The truth of this you can't deny, 
If on yourself you will rely; 
Success will greet you by-and-by, 
And you'll be a 
happy man. 
Never shirk nor sneer a 
friend, 
A. possible chance you may offend 
And wound him when you don't intend; 
So let this be your plan. 
What faults in others you detect, 
Take to yourself and then reflect; 
Perhaps you have the same defect, 
And remember it if you can. 
Civility costs nothing, 
Of that you may be sure; 
Respect show you to every one, 
And kindly treat the poor; 
Your business done, don't stay out late, 
To help a 
friend ne'er hesitate; 
Live well yourself, but moderate, 
And you'll all be happy then.

A 
BIRD FLIES HIGH, FLIES LOW. 
Words by JOHN MCVEIGH. 
Music by Jour: CASEY. 
Sung With tremendous success by M ISS KATE MONTROSE. 
A moment now I 
ask with you, 
Attention give me, pray; 
I'll sing a 
song, it's not too long, 
To miss the time away; 
The title chosen, long since heard, 
When a 
child sonic years ago; 
has just of late been called to mind, 
A 
bird flies high, flies low. 
Cleorr(R.—It's a 
motto good, you will find it true, 
No matter where you go; 
The lines I've Spoken I'll respect. 
A 
bird flies high, flies low. 
I 
studied well the motto o'er, 
And a 
good deal in it find; 
It tends to soften and instruct, 
The very coarsest mind; 
Tho' rich to-day, you to-morrow may, 
Be very poor and low; 
The truth this motto here conveys, 
A 
bird flies high, flies low. 
C/wom.--Then pity at least we should extend, 
Even to our bitterest foe; 
For who can tell what time may send, 
Since a 
bird flies high, flies low. 
If a 
business venture you should try, 
Let honesty be your aim; 
And if you lose make no complaint, 
For you're the one to blame; 
If a 
man don't suit you, don't abuse, 
But gently let him go, 
Be sure you're right, then go ahead, 
For a 
bird flies high, flies low. 
(Thora.. —To err is human, to forgive divine, 
Of course, that you all know; 
So a 
kind word speak to every one; 
For a 
bird flies high, flies low. 
THE LOSER IN THE END. 
Written by JOHN -McVmaft. 
Sung with great success by Miss KATE MoNmosE at 
Novelty Theatre, New York City, 
As you walk along the street, how often do you meet 
Some people who would prcudly pass you by; 
And because they're better dressed, why do they you detest 
And with disdain upon you cast their eye? 
I 
here declare such actions are not right, 
But my friends you know that dollars have their might; 
So let them have their way, and perhaps some future day, 
They may come out the losers in the end. 
'Twas but a 
day or two ago, while walking out quite, 
I 
saw a 
beggar sitting in the street; 
As a 
rich man missed him by, he loud for alms did cry, 
But he spurned the beggar with his feet; 
1 
inquired his name and found it to be Brown, 
He'd got f 
ich by bursting penny banks in town; 
And as I 
to the beggar went, and gave him my humble cent 
I 
thought Brown might be the loser in the end. 
One thing we can't erase, this life is but a 
race, 
In which each one tries to pass the other by; 
Some in riches take the lead, while others poor indeed, 
Can't get along no matter how they try; 
But to-night, my friends, the object of my song, 
Is to prove that right is greater far than wrong; 
And the man that robs the poor, and then drives him from 
his door, 
Must surely be the loser in the end.

Don't give up the Old Friend for the New 
A 
very popular Motto Song. 
Words by JOHN MCVEIGH. 
Music by JOE A. 
Gumcit. 
Sung with great success by MISS KATE MONTROSE at Novelty Theatre 
New York City. 
There's many a 
song with many a 
motto, 
, 
Each containing good advice; 
Obey their teachings, too, we ought to, 
Tho' great temptations us entice; 
To sing a new song I'll endeavor, 
And one I 
hope will please a 
few; 
Make all the friends you can, but never 
Give up the old friend for the new. 
CHORUS: 
Then listen to the motto that I 
give you, 
You'll find a 
good one it will prove, and true; 
Make all the friends you can, 
Always lend a 
helping hand. 
But don't give up the old friend ftr the new. 
You may be poor in life's beginning, 
A 
man you meet just like yourself; 
His friendship you succeed in winning, 
He helps you on the road to wealth; 
And when you've won it, do not sever 
The ties that bind him still to you; 
lie helped you in your need, so never 
Give up the old friend for the new. 
To those who may, perhaps, be married, 
A word or two I 
have to say; 
By fairer faces be not carried, 
Completely off and led astray; 
In this, the age of quick divorces, 
Men love their wives a 
year or two; 
Then wander into other courses, 
Give up the old wife for the new. 
(Chorus). 
(Chorus).

McCORMICK'S MULE. 
Written by JAMES RICHMOND. 
Recited by PAT RooNEY with great success. 
McCormick had a 
Jack-ass, 
Blind in the _teeth, lame in one eye; 
He had a 
celebrated record, 
For eating water and drinking pie; 
This Jack-ass was a 
high kicker, 
lie won many an undisputed prize; 
He kicked out seven rows of Mrs. Murphy's teeth, 
And jabbed out both her eyes. 
McCormick's Mule. 
This mule was born in Ireland, 
He wears the Shamrock on his nose; 
At the Centennial he stole an iron safe, 
And dressed himself in a 
suit of clothes; 
He broke into a 
Jewelry store, 
Stabbed the proprietor with a 
nail; 
Chased four Policeman into the river, 
And set fire to the Jail. 
McCormick's Mule. 
McCormick was arrested, and produced the mule, 
For him all the neighbors had a 
grudge; 
lie slapped the Jury in the mouth with his tail, 
And kicked the neck-tie off the Judge; 
The mule escaped, and they held McCormick, 
For the doings of the mule he was tried; 
lie was just getting ten years' sentence, 
When a 
telegram came the mule had died. 
McCormick's Mule. 
AINP. 110. 
Moral on his Grave-Stone. 
Judge me as a 
Jack-ass, 
Or judge me as a 
fool; 
I 
was smarter than some politicians, 
That went to Grammar !School; 
I 
had the brains of a 
mighty man, 
But for one I 
could not pass; 
So please have printed on my grave, 
McCormick's little Jack-ass.

MY ELDEST DAUGHTER CLARA. 
Copyrighted by A. J. Fisher, 1880. 
Written by James Richmond for Pat Rooney and suN 
by him with great success. 
Sure I 
have a 
lovely daughter, 
On the stage she cuts a 
dash, 
She wears blonde wigs and powders her face, 
To try and catch a 
mash. 
She can dance a 
tailor's hornpipe, 
She tell the old woman that she is fine, 
She wears flesh colored pants when sh2 comes 
out to dance, 
And gets drunk on German wine. 
CHORUS. 
She wears dizzy diamonds and wings on her back, [ break. 
In the ballet dance she is like a 
jumping jack, [break. 
She has a 
barrel of paint on her face, 
Like a 
fairy from Conamarra, 
The pride of the McCormick family, 
is my eldest daughter Clara. 
You should see her in the can- can, 
She is the dead picture of her ma, 
She has a 
foot as big as a 
telegraph pole, 
Her features are like her pa. 
She has all the swells near crazy, 
An engagement for life she has signed, 
She is hitched to a 
man named Freddie McCan. 
He has a 
million dollars in his mind. 
HORSESHOES. 
Written by Jerry Cohan expressly for Billy Carter, and 
sung by him with great success. 
Copyrighted by A. J. Fisher, 1880. 
Since horseshoes are in fashion why a 
horseshoe song I'll 
sing, 
Its the latest superstition, the most fashionable thing, 
But the only ones 'cept horses who wear them as a 
rule, 
To do them any good must be the jackass or the mule. 
The ladies wear the horseshoe on their fing-ers,ears and hair, 
The men wear horseshoe pins and canes, it's horseshoe 
everywhere, 
They hang them on the masts at sea to keep away the gales, 
There's horseshoe clocks and bootjacks, horseshoe tracks 
and horseshoe nails. 
They put a 
horseshoe at the gate to keep the witches out, 
Thin people carry a 
horseshoe for luck to make 'em stout, 
And fat folks keep the horseshoe for luck to make them thin 
Yet the bummer sells the horseshoe to the junkman to get 
gin, 
The gambler carries the horseshoe his victim for to skin, 
And the victim carries a 
horseshoe to take the gambler in, 
The fisherman carries a 
horseshoe to help him make a 
haul, 
And if he catches only horseshoe fish he has no luck at all. 
They bake the bread in horseshoe pans, and mould the 
butter, too. 
They nail the horseshoe in the trunk to make the old 
clothes new, 
They hang 'em on the church door and for good luek to 
'em pray, 
And the preacher carries a 
horseshoe to keep the girls away 
The temperance man he carries it to protect him from the 
rum, 
And in hopes he may keep always drunk it's treasured by 
the bum, 
If you want to see a 
horseshoe fly just tickle a 
mule and 
get struck. 
I've sung myself quite horse shoe see, so I'll wish you all 
good luck. 
The Poor Serio-Comic, 
Words by John McVeigh. 
To my friend Wm. Carter, and sung by him with g 
ea 
success. 
Oh ! the titles of songs of late are so used 
That it's hard a 
new one to find, 
But I've hit one at last and I 
think 't 
will please, 
So carefully bear it in mind.

Remember the poor," " You've children of your own, 
I'll admit to be very good logic, 
But the title I've given to the one I'll now sing, 
Is " Pity the poor serio-comic." 
See how she struggles with music and words, 
She acts like a 
colt on a 
frolic, 
She yells and she screeches then gets out of key, 
So pity the poor serio-comic. 
About six months ago, a 
mechanic she was, 
In a 
hotel at the corner of the street, 
Till she formed the acquaintance of a 
bad actor so gay, 
Who told her she was charming and neat, 
He put her on the stage with about a 
dozon more. 
And they say now that she takes a 
tonic, 
But she isn't to blame—sure she's working for fame, 
So pity the poor serio-comic. 
CHORUS. 
Then help her along to the jail if ybu can, 
And her discords put to an end, 
Treat her with kindness, then slug her with Wicks, 
And prove your the dizzy's best friend. 
NoN..,- these poor serio-comics oft have nothing to wear, 
Except ar-,ses that cost a 
hundred or two, 
And I'm sure that's enougb and I'll know you'll admit, 
To make any poor creature feel blue. 
Oh, they get by the week ten dollars or so, 
Which makes them feel badly and chronic, 
Vet they wear diamond rings that would swell a 
man't 
head, 
Those poor dizzy serio-comics. 
CHORUS. - 
Then always extend to them your hand or your foot, 
In kindness to them never lack, 
For the poor serio-comic don't know what she does, 
Let her alone and she'll surely come back. 
The Man that Knew the Actors. 
Written and sung by JOHN AlcVEton. Dedicated to my friend HARRY 
McAvoy. 
Of a 
queer young man I'm going to tell, 
And every one of you know him well ; 
He's rather a 
sort of a 
dizzy swell, 
The man that knew the actors. 
He knew every actor, both east and west, 
The highest, the lowest, the least, the best ; 
In fact he would never give you a 
rest, 
The man that knew the actors. 
He knew Frank Girard, Charles White and Pat Rooney; 
When he spoke of Add Ryman he nearly went " looney." 
He knew both the Tonys, Pastor and Hart, 
And said he gave Harrigan his very first start. 
He knew John Wild, Johnny Shay and Bill Gray; 
And he knew Bill Thompson, wrote many a 
play. 
He knew Billy Barry as well as his mother, 
And Frank Bennett to him was as dear as a 
brother; 
Watson and Ellis he knew thoroughly well, 
And he put in the business John and Henry Kernell. 
He knew the Deveres, both Samuel and Billy, 
And he raised Cool Burgess, who knocked the " guys " silly 
Gus Williams, he said, is a 
great friend of mine, 
" 
He eats nothing but birds, and drinks nothing but wine." 
Lew Simmonds and Richmond are two of his pards, 
And Sanford and Wilson enjoy his regards. 
Continued. 
Billy Emerson and Newcomb are two of his friends, 
And to Schoolcraft and Coes his best wishes extends ; 
He knows Hughey Dougherty, and of him spoke well, 
And he lived in the same house with Senator Bell. 
Delehanty and Hengler, Harry Thompson and McKee 
Were many times out with him on a 
good " spree." 
He gave Charley Diamond his first lesson in music, 
And writes all the songs for Bill Morton and Gulick. 
He knows Backus and Wambold, and fat Billy Birch, 
They introduced him to Thatcher one day in a 
church. 
Billy Carter, Jaques, Kruger and himself are quite thick, 
He knows all the Nortons, including one they call Nick; 
Milt Barlow, George Wilson, and West and Primrose, 
Wouldn's lose his good will for a 
million of shows. 
He knows Larry Tooley, Joe Lang, and Ned West, 
And Cummings, and Harrington, his friendship attest. 
He knew Quilter and Goldrich, and old Walter Bray, 
In fact, he knows every actor in the country to-day. 
He knows people that were dead for ninety-nine years, 
And whenever he spoke of them he always shed tears. 
A 
Mick who was listening to him a 
couple of hours, 
Said: "Do you know a 
young man by the name of Ed Powers?" 
He said he did not—and could you suppose 
That the terrier thumped him square on the nose, 
Saying: " Ye're a 
liar," as his ear he did eat, 
And made a 
kick at his neck as he ran in the street; 
And now he knows no actor.

A 
Contradiction. 
" 
The mill will never grind again 
With the water that has past." 
A 
maxim of the olden time 
That will forever last. 
This theme, in verses written, 
Preaches a 
sermon to all; 
But critically weighed with wisdom, 
How does the lesson fall ? 
The mill lipon a 
slope doth stand, 
It bears an antique shape; 
Waters from the mountain-land 
Seem happy to escape, 
And, rushing by the old mill's wheel,. 
Causing it to grind, 
Bound madly on the vale beyond, 
A 
level there to find. 
The race now o'er, with calmness 
Into a 
lake the water flows, 
And, mingling with the tranquil flood, 
Seeks peace in sweet repose. 
The bright sunbeams then visiting 
This realm to Somnus given, 
The tiny globes in vapors rise 
To space above in heaven. 
Once in air, they congregate, 
Fantastic clouds to be, 
And, wafted by the summer breeze, 
Float off most gracefully. 
Soon the mountain tops are reached, 
Ere they cling for rest; 
Each rugged peak is hid from view, 
Each in vapor dressed. 
At morn the clouds would fain ascend, 
And leave this dreary plain; 
But, chilled through by the frigid air, 
Condensed, they fall in rain. 
As the pearly drops alight, 
They dance about with glee, 
For are they not of earth again, 
Just as they used to be ? 
They prance, they skip, and race along 
O'er pebbled brook and rill— 
When lo! they reach familiar ground, 
And pass the saute old mill. 
In doing so they turn the wheel, 
With sparkling spray o'ercast. 
Thus proving that the mill does grind 
With water that has past. 
Philosophically the lesson's taught, 
Bidding us beware, 
Although a 
chance unheeded pass, 
Not to incite despair. 
Labor on with redoubled zeal, 
Lost hours to redeem, 
And teacn your conscience thus to feel, 
That things are what they seem. 
Opportunities appearing lost, 
And numbered with the slain, 
By providential agencies 
ill surely come again. 
Now bear in mind, although the Fates 
Your hopes continuahy blast, 
Kind Nature's mill will grind again 
With water that has past.

Published by W HITE 
SMITH & Co., 516 Washington St.. Boston Mass. 
The sweetest treasure life can give 
I 
clasp linto my heart to-day, 
And childhood's golden moments live 
In dreams that soon must fade away. 
I 
see my angel mother's face, 
I 
hear her voice so true and brave, 
Her smile beams out with hallowed grace, 
From thee, my rose from mother's grave. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, dearest spot of all on earth, 
That grassy mound where willows wave 
Oh precious gem of countless worth, 
My rose from angel mother's grave. 
What memories cluster around it now, 
Like jewels around some holy shrine; 
Her loving hands are on my brow, 
her eyes so fondly gaze in mine. 
I 
seem to gather to my breast 
The place and comfort life would crave. 
And dewy tears so fond and blest 
Are thine, dear rose from mother's grave. 
Oh, dearest spot of all on earth, & c. 
It whispers that she dwells afar, 
And watches o'er her loved ones here ; 
Oh, brighter than the morning star 
Each thought of thee my mother dear. 
Thy loving arms again caress me 
With all the hope and joy they gave, 
While fondly to my lips I 
press 
Thy leaves, my rose from mother's grave. 
Oh, dearest spot of all on earth, &c.

A 
VIOLET FROM MOTHER'S GRAVE, 
Words and Music by Wriz H. Fox. 
Sung by Wm. McAtooN in all the principal Theatres in America, and 
by O'NEIL & CONROY. 
Scenes of my childhood arise before my gaze, 
Bringing recollections of my childhood's happy days; 
When down in the meadow in childhood I 
would roam, 
But there's no one left to cheer now within my good 
old home; 
Father and Mother they have passed away, 
Sister and Brother are laid beneath the clay; 
But while life does remain, there's one thing I'll retain, 
A 
small Violet I 
plucked from Mother's Grave. 
CHORUS: 
Only a 
Violet I 
plucked when but a 
boy, 
And often when I'm sad at heart, this plant has 
give me joy; 
But while life does remain, in memorium I'll retain, 
That small violet I 
plucked from Mother's Grave. 
how well I 
remember my dear old Mother's smile, 
As she used to greet me when I 
returned from toil; 
Always knitting in the old arm chair, 
Father used to sit and read for all us children there; 
But now all is silent around the good old home, 
They all have left me in sorrow for to roam; 
While life does remain, there's one thing I'll retain, 
A 
small Violet I 
plucked from Mother's Grave.

Why Did My Josie Go? 
Written by Wm. J. SceismoN, of SCANLON & Csomig. 
I 
went up to Barnum's a 
short time ago, 
The circus of course there to see, 
The evening being fine and to spend a 
nice time, 
I 
brought my dear Josie with me. 
She seemed so delighted it made me feel good, 
My heart with joy it did beat, 
And when it was over we started to go 
From the circus out into the street. 
Crionus. 
Oh, my I 
wasn't it fine, 
Oh, how the riders did shine, 
The clown he was laughing, talking and chaffing, 
My 
little Josie she laughed all the time. 
Last night when we reached my dear Josie's home, 
She said, now don't think me a 
bore 
If I 
ask you to call here again to morrow night, 
To the circus we'll go just once more. 
My answer was yes, of course, my dear Joe, 
What e'er your request it may be, 
I'll grant it, my love, if it lies in my power, 
For my love it is always with thee. 
Next evening again to the circus we went, 
My Josie she looked like a 
queen, 
When the riders came out they all looked at her, 
She very much embarassed did seem, 
But, alas! she cried out to the man in the ring, 
My darling, l'm waiting for thee, 
She jumped from my side to my great surprise, 
And every one there laughed at me. 
(Chorus.) 
CHORUS. 
Oh, my! why did she go ? 
Oh, why did she treat me so, 
She was my darling, always so charming, 
None in this world like my own little Joe.

Copyrighted and published in sheet music by E. H. HARDING, 229 Bowery. 
Price 4o cents. 
Published by permission. 
We've oft sung of the major, 
And of the captain too, 
But now I've chosen for my rhyme 
A 
subject new to you. 
'Ms of our gallant soldier boys. 
All honor them the while, 
Out boys in blue and sailors true, 
Who belong to the Rank and File. 
CHORUS. 
Eyes right! Steady, boys! 
Merrily we cheer, 
Under the starry flag, 
That ever we hold dear. 
Gaily the music plays, 
The ladies love to smile 
Upon the throng a 
thousand strong, 
Who belong to the Rank and File. 
In the tented field of honor 
We hold our lives but small, 
And bravely clan together 
At the bugle's martial call. 
We greet the shouts of victory 
With cheers and saddened smile, 
And sigh for slaughtered comrades 
Who belonged to the Rank and File. 
Eyes right, &e. 
When in the days of Seventy-six 
Our country plunged in war, 
And peril ev'rywhere beset 
Our foe invaded shore; 
Bold, sturdy men were needed then, 
To win proud vict'ry's smile, 
So while we're here let's give a 
cheer 
'or America's Rank and File. 
Eyes right, tke,, 
Kiss Me, Love, Before I 
Go. 
Composed by W M. A. 
HUNTLEY, and sung by DAVE W AMBOLD, of the 
San Francisco Minstrels. 
I 
must leave you, love, to-morrow, 
Leave you here, to roam afar, 
And it gives me pain and sorrow, 
Since I 
ve learned how dear you are. 
Well I 
know you'll not be near me, 
As I 
wander to and fro; 
So, to comfort and to cheer me, 
Kiss me, love, before I 
go. 
CHORUS. 
Sweetest thoughts of thee I'm keeping, 
Smiles of thine should brightly glow; 
Can I 
go and leave you weeping, 
Kiss me, then, before I 
go. 
You will sit here in the gloaming, 
As you have so oft before, 
But you'll wait in vain my coming 
To the little cottage door. 
For ' mid oher scenes and pleasures 
I 
shall wander to and fro; 
If yoar Ite:rt keep mine in treasure, 
Kiss me, love, before I 
go. 
Sweetest thoughts, &c. 
You may never sit beside me, 
Never hold my hand again ; 
Yet your sunny face will guide me, 
In the sunshine, in the rain. 
Where on earth I 
chance to wander, 
Still a 
memory sweet and low, 
Of the faded past I'll ponder— 
Kiss me, love, before I 
go. 
Sweetest thoughts, &C. 
Kicking Mule. 
Copyrighted, 1879, by A. J. FISIIER, 24 Vesey St., N. Y 
Originally sung by M IXT CARTER. 
There was a 
little kicking man, 
His name was Simon Slick, 
He owned a 
mule with dreamy eyes, 
And how that mute could kick. 
He'd shut one eye and shake his tail, 
And greet you with a 
smile, 
Then gently telegraph his leg, 
And raise you half a 
mile. 
CHORUS. 
This mule was a 
kicker, 
He'd raise you up slicker, 
And knock you down quicker 
Than Baxter street liquor, 
He eat like a 
micker, 
A 
hungry bill sticker, 
As a 
kicker, no quicker 
Could ever be found. 
His skin was gutta percha, 
And his hoof was hard as lead, 
He'd lift y u 
like a 
feather too, 
And st,rf d 
you on your head, 
He'd kick as quick as lightning, 
And he had an iron jaw, 
lie was jast the thing to have around 
To tame your mother-in-law. 
CHORUS. 
His hoof would amaze ye 
And make you feel hazy, 
how nice he could raise ye 
And knock you clean crazy. 
This mule was a 
daisy, 
Ahhough he was lazy, 
This daisy so lazy 
Could kiek like a 
steer. 
KICKING MULE. 
(Continued.) 
Hd bit a 
Thomas cat in two, 
And pulverized a 
hog, 
He dissected seven Chinamen, 
And inash'd a 
yaller dog, 
He kicked the stuffing front a 
goose, 
And broke a 
nigger's back, 
And stopped an Erie railway train, 
And kicked it off the track. 
His shoes they were rusty, 
His temper was crusty, 
His eyes they were musty, 
his tail it was dusty, 
His shape would disgust ye, 
He'd kick till he'd bust ye, 
He was musty and dusty, 
And rusty also. 
He'd stop a 
steamboat with his head, 
And kick it out of sight, 
Ile'd kick a 
boarding house apart 
At twelve o'clock at night. 
The boarders in their short stop clothes (suits) 
They stood and held their breath, 
When he rammed his hind legs down his throa 
And kicked himself to death. 
This mule he was spunky, 
He'd climb like a 
monkey 
And bray like a 
donkey, 
You bet he was brinkey, 
Although he was chunkey, 
No fool or no flunkey 
Played him for a 
monkey, 
Or donkey, oh, no.

HI COCKALORUM, JIG, JIG, JIG. 
As sung with great success by Miss JENNIE HUGHES. 
In Harlem it was once my fate to see four little boys, 
Who, trying to enjoy themselves, kicked up an awful noise; 
The game they played was one which I 
had never seen before, 
But what drew my attention was to hear these urchins revr. 
CHORUS. 
Hi Cockalorum, jig, jig, jig, 
Jig, jig, jig, jig, jig, jig, 
Classical language, don't you twig, 
Iii Cockalorum, jig, jig, jig. 
Returning to my friends to diRe, I 
being a 
good young moar, 
They asked me if I' d 
say the grace before the meal began. 
All eyes were closed, each head was bent, hands clasped in 
style devout, 
I 
meant to say it proper, but instead I 
blurted out. 
Cockalorum, & c. 
Now, after this, most strange to say, the phrase ran in my 
head, 
And though I 
tried to banish it, it never, never fled; 
I 
took to drink, I 
tried the turf, balls, concerts, or the play, 
But no odds what the music was, to me it seemed to say. 
CHORTJ.S.—rn Cockalorum, & c. 
Each girl who used to think me nice, soon put me down ft 
bore, 
Instead of warm receptions, I 
was cooly shown the door, 
At every such rebuff, of course, I 
asked the reason why 
And each bewitching damsel said in accents sweetly shy.

How sinks my heart with fond alarms, 
The tear is hiding in mine eye, 
For time doth thrust me from thine arms; 
Good bye, sweetheart, good bye! 
Good bye, sweetheart, good bye! 
For time doth thrust me from thine arms. 
Good bye, sweetheart, good bye!

When I'm dead and-gone from you darling, 
When I'm laid away in my grave, 
When my spirit has gone to heaven above; 
To him who my soul will save. 
When you are happy and gay once more, 
Thinking of the days that have been, 
There's one little wish I 
ask of you, 
See that my grave's kept green.

HORUS. 
Oh, the days will come to you darling, 
When on earth no more I'll be seen, 
One sweet little wish, darling, grant me, 
See that my grave's kept green. 
Will you keep me, love, in remembrance, 
When the voice of chiding is heard, 
While other's may speak in censure or blame, 
Speak not one unkindly word. 
When you are happy and gay once more, 
Thinning of the days that Lave been, 
There's one little wish I 
ask of you, 
See that my grave's kept green.

To our bountiful Father above, 
We will offer the tribute of praise, 
For the glorious zift of his love, 
And the blessing that hallow our days'.

See that my Grave is Whitewashed 
Every Summer. 
Written by JAs. McAvoY expressly for the SPARKS BROTHERS, and sung 
by them with tremendous success. 
When I've cashed in my checks, little Rosebud, 
When I 
am six foot under the turf, 
I 
forgive you, but you played me for a 
gilly, 
You worked me for every nickel I 
was worth. 
Oh, you said I 
could look, but mustn't touch, 
And you put me in such a 
dilemma; 
But there is one little snap I 
want to fake up between us— 
That is, see that my grave is whitewashed every summer. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, the days will come to your poison face. 
Think of how you backcapped me when I 
was living. 
Clean the snow off, when I'm planted, with a 
shovel, 
darling, 
And decorate my grave with turkeys' breasts, Thanks-. 
giving. 
Don't get cranky when I 
ask you to remember, 
When you used to give me taffy on the stick, 
And with your funny gags you paralyzed me— 
But, my darling, you can't say I 
ever kicked. 
I 
will meet you in the happy land of Canaan, 
Tr-la-lee, skip the sewer, for you are my baby; 
Plant huckleberry trees in the next lot to where I'm 
planted, darling, 
And see that my grave is kept shady. 
Oh the days will come. &c.

OH fancy brings a 
thought to me 
Of flowers sweet and rare, 
With grace and beauty there combined, 
And brightest hues so fair— 
So like a 
maiden that I 
loved— 
It was my happy lot: 
I 
whispered when we parted last— 
" 
Ohl you'll forget me not!" 
CHORUS. 
Graceful and as charming as a 
lily in the pond— 
Time has passed so swiftly—for, of her I 
am so fond--
Basics and the roses, too, they grow around the spot 
Where we parted and I 
whispered— 
" 
You'll forget me not! " 
(Dance) 
We met—I 
really don't know where— 
But still 'tis all the same--
For love walks in the busy streets 
As well as in the lane: 
I 
gently pressed her tiny hand: 
She glanced at me a 
shot— 
She dropped a 
flower, I 
picked it up— 
A 
sweet forget-rne-not I 
(Chorus and Dance.) 
At last there came a 
happy day 
And something that I 
said 
lust caused her lips to murmur " yes " 
And shortly we were wed. 
A 
little cottage by the brook, 
And a 
tiny garden spot 
Where grows a 
little flower called— 
A sweet forget-me-not!

Now the cause of all the trouble I

Somebody called Johnny McIntire a 
bum; 
Johnny got up and he stuck out his hand, 
And he swore he could lick any cripple in the land. 
Big John Monohan was standing by the door, 
He caught a

He went for little Brady, and he hit him such a

That he knocked his Sunday shirt clean off of his back.

We've heard marshal songs and songs of the sea; 
Love songs and comic songs, but they don't suit me. 
We love to sing of Ireland—sweet land of our birth— 
I'm Paddy, her son, and she's my mother earth. 
Oh Erin, my country it grieves us to see 
Our enemies prosper, and yet we are not free. 
We fight for other countries as through life we roam, 
When half of our fighting would free our old home. 
CHORUS. 
Then hurrah for the sons of Erin's Isle! 
Hurrah for the daughters, who on us do smile I 
A 
fig for her foes, where-ever they may be; 
Three cheers for old Ireland and sweet liberty. 
Then arise, sons of Erin, and prove to the world 
The sunburst of freedom is once more unfurled. 
Be united like brothers, and join hand in hand, 
Then you'll drive the proud Saxon from off of our land.. 
Sure the land is the people's, and who dare to dispute 
The word of our maker—for he spoke the truth. 
Then desend from the hill, and arise from the glen, 
And once more the battle of freedom begin. 
Then hurrah, &c.

MY POOR HEART IS SAD WITH ITS 
DREAMING. 
As sung by the 13th Ward Glee Club. 
MY poor heart is sad with its dreaming, 
It brings back the once happy day, 
When earth like a 
heaven was seeming, 
But now it has passed all away. 
They say that young loves like the flowers, 
That needs tender care in its urn, 
But minelt was snatched from the bower, 
And I 
never gained one in return. 
CHORUS. 
My poor heart is sad with its dreaming, 
It brings back the once happy day, 
When earth like a 
heaven was seeming, 
But now it has passed all away. 
My sad heart recalls all the pleasure, 
Of thoughts that are all, all for the; 
When dreaming of you, of its treasure, 
And you seemed to love none but me. 
Tho' we meet not as friends, yet I'll never, 
One kind word to thee give, 
For your cherished memory ever, 
Shall be my soulj op while I 
live.

My Mother-in-law 
sung with grcat success by HARRY McAvoy at the London Theatre, 
New York, in the sketch of " Jealousy or Two Can Play at that 
Game," and in all the principal theatres in America. 
If you'll listen while I 
will sing you a 
ditty— 
It's about the worst woman that ever you saw, 
And when you have heard it you'll say it's a 
pity 
That ever I 
had such a 
mother-in-law. 
Whatever I 
do she is always fault finding, 
Wherever I 
goshe is sure to be there, 
And if I 
don't do why just as she asks me, 
She will help herself to a 
lock of my hair. 
CHORUS. 
My life is all troubles, I 
cannot live happy, 
If I 
open my mouth she will shove in her jaw, 
I'd rather be sent to jail or to congress 
Than to live ail my life with my mother-in-law. 
Now she is so ugly she frightens the children 
Whenever she happens to go out in the street, 
She's a 
hole in hei mouth like a 
crack in a 
pumpkin, 
A 
hump on her back—I'll never mention her feet, 
And she's got a 
notion that she is good-looking, 
Though her face is the worst one that ever was seen, 
And when she sits down to have her picture taken, 
The very first squint she breaks the machine. 
My life is, &c. 
Now I 
told her one day when I 
married her daughter, 
That I 
did not intend the whole family to wed, 
When she quick helped herself to a 
bucket of water 
And taking good aim let it fly at my head. 
Now I've heard that they had some good shooting at 
Creedmoor, 
And the shots were so close they were all but a 
draw 
1;ut I'd give ten dollars to any good shooter, 
That could rid me at once of my mother-in-law. 
My life is, & c.

We went next day when the weather it was fine, 
Ili, Jenny; ho, Jenny—come along with me, 
We treated her to cider, hoe cake and wine, 
Hi, Jenny; ho, Jenny Johnston, (Break.) 
We took her to a

Then there was a

Love Him all the Same. 
Sung by EMMA ROGERS, in the sketch written for her by N ED STRAIGI/T, 
entitled: " Jealousy ; or, Two can Play at that Game." 
Where are all the words endearing 
That my darling used to say ? 
Where the tones that were so cheering? 
Oh bring them back to me, I 
pray. 
They say that he is false to me, 
Has brought upon me deepest sharne; 
Yet bring him back where'er he be, 
For, oh, I 
love him all the same, 
CHORUS. 
Tho' the ocean rolls between us, 
Tho' upon his name's a 
stain, 
Tho' he languish in a 
prison, 
Still I 
love him all the same. 
When we parted in the arbor, 
Sweet to me the kiss he gave, 
As his ship saird from the harbor 
My heart was lonely as the grave. 
Three long and weary years have fleti 
One letter only from him came, 
" 
I'm coming back to you," he said, 
And oh, I 
love him all the same. 
Tho' the ocean rolls,

On a 
bright summer morning I 
pursued my way, 
As happy as a 
robin when he trills his lay, 
That morning such a 
letter from my true love came, 
Commencing with " My Dearest," and concluding with her 
name. 
Such a 
pretty letter, with its perfume sweet, 
Cupid's with their arrows loving hearts to meet, 
Lots of blots for kisses, and a 
seal of blue, 
Meaning that my love is true to you.

For on a

pursued my way, 
As happy as a 
robin when he trills his lay, 
That morning such a 
letter from my true love came, 
Commencing with " My Dearest," and concluding with her 
name. 
Now who the letter came from I 
of course must tell, 
A charming little maiden, and her name is Belle, 
She's just as sweet as honey, and she writes to me— 
You see that we are parted, she is far across the sea. 
If you've ever been in love, of course you'll understand 
The feelings of my heart, when loving letters reach your hand, 
How 
you'll stand and wonder what your sweetheart she has said, 
As I 
did, with the one that I 
have read. 
For on a 
bright summer, &c. 
Of course I'm going to answer in a 
true love strain, 
And ask my little darling to return again, 
And soon a 
ship that's sailing o'er the dark blue sea, 
Will bring me such a 
letter, from my sweetheart it will be. 
Then when we are married, I 
will write you all the news, 
Tell you how we get along, and never have the blues, 
What a 
little treasure wife I 
got from o'er the sea, 
Our letters then will spell L- O-V- E.

bright summer, &c.

LOVED ONES AT HOME, 
Written and sung by Devlin and Tracy. 
Is there one here among us who cannot recall, 
Some bright happy scene of the past, 
Or some little token of friendship received, 
Which memory will hold till the last, 
It is fond recollections which guides me through life 
And will serve me wherever I 
roam, 
On land or on sea, they are pictured to me 
In my heart, those dear loved ones at home. 
There are times in our lives when the memory recalls, 
Sweet childhood which seems like a 
dream, 
And how we have strayed from a 
kind mother's words 
Now only remains to be seen, 
For each unkind word we have spoken to her, 
How gladly we now would atone, 
And oft heave a 
sigh for the days gone by 
When we think of the dear ones at home.

AIR—Fire in the Grate. 
Grandma has tendered her resignation, 
From this wicked world of sin ; 
She packed her valise and departed, 
It contained a 
pack of cigarettes and some nigger girt 
She left her false teeth to Cousin Minnie, 
She gave pa the price of a 
shave, 
They put Dennis Kearney's picture on her tombstone, 
To keep the crows from off her grave. 
CHORUS— 
Her mind was always mashing, 
She was too fresh and awful shrewd ; 
She weighed ninety pounds when in fighting condition, 
And she never smoked or chewed. 
She used to go fishing with Christopher Columbus, 
And shooting shadows till she went insane, 
For a 
curiosity she took the prize, 
My great grandma, Sarah Jane. 
She tried to sing bass and swallowed her teeth, 
Her lungs from eating snuff were sore; 
She was so baShful if there was a 
man in her room, 
She'd get up and shut the door. 
She willed her voice to her uncle's nephew, 
When she died she was one hundred and eighty-seven, 
They say she is cook in a 
five-cent restaurant, 
Four miles and a

Her mind was always, etc. 
A RECITATION. 
Written by SHEEHAN and MCGLONE. Respectfully dedicated 
IO JOHN REILLY. 
O'Reilley owned a 
billy goat 
And a 
great buck goat was he, 
He would buck almost any thing 
That he'd happen for to see. 
And if at night he'd roam the streets 
And a 
drunken man he'd meet, 
He'd buck him till he was sick and tired, 
And then his clothes he'd eat— 
O'Reilley's billy goat. 
He knew every policeman on the beat, 
And he knew if him they found 
That he'd spend a 
short vacation 
Down here in the c:ty pound. 
He ate Mrs. Mulligan' underclothes 
That was hanging on the line, 
Shure he bucked a 
Dutchman in the belly, 
And knocked him out of time— 
O'Reilley's billy goat. 
But every goat must have his day, 
And this goat's day did come— 
He met a 
butcher's dog one day, 
And the dog for him did run. 
He chased the goat through the streets, 
Shure the dog for him was too smart, 
He chased him till he lost his wind 
And he died of a 
broken heart— 
O'Reilley's billy goat. 
Now, down here in a 
vacant lot 
In a 
corner quite alone, 
There we buried O'Reilley's goat, 
And over him raised a 
stone; 
And perchance you'd pass that way, 
You'll find those words on it are wrote: 
Sacred to the memory of 
O'Reilley's great buck goat.

With the always-idle tramps.

Or lay upon the grass, 
And beg a

From any one whol pass.

Tlien march down Broadway, 
They pick up stumps and work the pumps, 
They're the terrors of the day.

When the little tramps are begging, 
They say they never begged before, 
They'll sleep in a 
cart or some alley, 
And beg at every basement, basement door. 
They take the road the 1st of may, 
Put lightning on their heels, 
And steal the farmers chickens and corn 
If they don't get three square meals; 
Beat every freight train in the land, 
When they're catched they make 'cm sick, 
And when snow falls upon the ground 
To the city double quick.

They're as quiet as a

The Captain of Police fcr to sleep in the Station fIouse.

THE OLD VILLAGE SCHOOL. ON THE 
GREEN, 
Written by FRANK VAN HESS for ED. BURTON, and sung by him 
with great success. 
Oh! I 
love the bright days of my youth to review, 
And fancy again I'm a 
boy, 
With my merry companions so faithful and true, 
And friendship that knows no alloy. 
Oh ! the thoughts I 
review as I 
ponder the past, 
Recalling each dear youthful scene; 
The one I 
most prize, and will love to the last, 
Is the old village school on the green. 
(Repeat two last lines.) 
Near the old village school the cottage still stands, 
Where I 
first saw the dawn of light; 
And now over its porch in rich clustering bands, 
The roses are blooming as bright 
As 'twas when with garlands and wreaths of wild flowers, 
We joyously crowned our May Queen, 
And told childish love tales in neat little bowers, 
Near the old village school on the green. 
(Repeat two last lines.) 
• 
I 
have left many dear and some loved ones behind 
To rest as I've journeyed along; 
There are others remain just as faithful and kind, 
To join in the laugh and the song; 
And when I 
am called by grim death to prepare, 
1. will answer with spirit serene, 
.1i they'll lay me to rest when I 
breathe my last prayer, 
Near the old village school on the green.

Copyrighted and published, 1878, by F. 13LumE, 86/ Broadway. 
Published by permission. 
In the old home by the hillside 
The days were full of glee, 
There were kind and loving faces, 
At night to welcome me ; 
The birds they sang to cheer me, 
I 
knew no care or woe, 
I 
was happy and contented, 
In the old home long ago. 
CHORUS. 
My heart was light and gay, 
And happy was each day, 
In the dear old home far away; 
I 
never can forget, 
No matter where I 
stray, 
My home by the hillside far away. 
In the old home by the hillside 
I 
used to laugh and play, 
And I 
never thought of sorrow 
Till the old folks pass'd away; 
Then I 
was left to wander 
In loneliness and pain; 
Oh my heart is ever praying, 
"May I 
see that home again." 
My heart was light, eze.

OLD MAN CHARACTER SONG. 
Lord I 
am coming up to dis yah glory, 
To follow my Loved one's in the Sky; 
I 
am tired of the sin down below here, 
And I'll tell you the reason why. 
I 
am weak and weary, so sad and weary to-night, 
I 
think I 
hear the Angels call, calling me home to-night; 
And when the sun is setting way far beyond the mill 
I'll sing the old, old story, and climbing Zion's Hill, 
CHORUS: 
Den come this way children, 
I 
am on my journey home; 
Good-bye old Snow Drop Nancy, 
Farewell old Aunty Chlo. 
Jest hand the Instrument down to me, 
I 
mean de old Banjo; 
And I 
will play my last farewell, 
Then Angels carry me home. 
Oh Lord let me be happy, let me walk the Golden Street, 
Where everything is lovely, and the Angels look so sweet; 
I 
want to be up higher, my massa he's gone there, [ there. 
And though I'm old and feeble, I'll sing and dance when 
I'll send down blessed tidings when trouble you offends, 
At sunrise every morning, I'll bread from Heaven send; 
Then good-bye now I'm happy, good-bye, fare you well, 
I'm climbing up the ladder, and ringing heaven's bell.

I 
know a 
little rosy bud, 
A 
light-weight of sixteen, 
Wid hair where warmest colors blaze, 
And heart where truth do beam. 
She have a 
cheek where freshness dwells, 
She'd spoil up any man, 
A lump of carrot gold is she, 
This little Maggie Ann. 
CHORUS. 
This little Maggie Ann, 
This rosy Maggie Ann. 
She'd strike you blind dumb, 
This sweet little plum, 
This slick and entirely bewilderin' young girl, 
They call little Maggie Ann. 
This rosy Maggie Ann, 
A Vaynus is she, 
Whatever that may be, 
Is little Maggie Ann. 
She used to be a 
working-man 
Down in a 
laundry fine, • 
And wrestle wid discouraged shirts, 
Till wid new life they'd shine. 
But she bekem high-tony, as 
Would any other man, 
And now a 
rale pure Irish nurse 
Is little Mary Ann. 
This little, &c. 
The babies all she washes, 
And then irons them out well, 
And fetches them a 
lively slap, 
If out of tune they yell. 
A fancy night-cap then she wears, 
This French Hibernian, 
Then to the Park wid all the babes 
Glides little Maggie Ann.

Courting- Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such P. way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by 
ntlemen who are either too (11111. 
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unladylike encourage. 
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. 
This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes a 
further explanation un. 
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties

Au ingenious little book of the thaumaturgic order

in such a 
way as to give opportunity for a 
decidedly 
puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary appear-

it is so bound that a 
practiced manipulator, taking it 
up, and flirting the leaves rapidly over, can make it ap-
pear to be filled with copies of only one picture, or with 
blank pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of 
figures.

appears to contain nothing but portraits of Harlequin, 
in his tesselated suit; the next, only Columbine; then, 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or Mephisto-
pheles.

ling of it."—Phila. Evening Bulletin.
