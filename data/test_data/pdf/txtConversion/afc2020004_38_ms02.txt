nn:  Read from nila northSun’s home on the Fallon Indian Reservation in Nevada. Commentary 
for the poem “i gotta be Indian tomorrow” by nila northSun:  
 
I selected this poem because it’s a reflection of what many Native Americans face each day as 
acculturation and traditional identity become blurred. Most Indians are a mix of races, most 
Indians live off reservation, and many don’t practice traditional ceremonies. Besides being a 
‘card carrying’ enrolled tribal member, is their tribalness in their darker skin, dark hair, 
knowledge of traditional ways? Right now my hair is purple. Does that make me less Indian? 
 
I suppose it depends on the audience. As the poem was about a radio interview and poetry 
reading, I realized the audience couldn’t see me, that in order to be ‘recognized’ as a Native 
American poet I should include some stereotypical cliché, short of teepees and war cries. There 
is resistance in trying to fit into a perceived mold yet still valuing and acknowledging my tribal 
identity. 
 
With many tribes lowering blood quantums for tribal enrollment, in an effort to keep 
membership high enough for grants and services to justify continued programs for tribal 
members, the physicality of tribal members begin to bleach out. There are a lot of blue-eyed, 
blonde Indians. Does that make them less? What if they know their history, their ceremonies, 
speak their language? What if their darker cousin embraces ‘the American dream’ of the 
‘colonizers’ turning their backs to all things native? 
 
I think it is a conundrum many of us face. Are we Indian enough? Is it reflected in our everyday 
behaviors? Or only when we put on our beaded earrings?
