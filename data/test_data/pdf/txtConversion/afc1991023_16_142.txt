operation of Clifford Frazee and his son Steve. 
The pictures are 
arranged in the order of steps taken by the Frazees. 
For further 
information please refer to PFP83-FMO1014 and the corresponding 
black and white contact sheets.

the area to be cut next. 
5-6 look west, the direction from which 
we entered the cedar swamp. 
7: 
The truck with winch used to hoist the logs onto the truck. 
Steve is on the truck and Cliff is 
looking for the next log to go 
on 
8: 
Steve wraps the hooked cable around a group of 
logs near the 
butt of the log, preparing them for hoisting up to the truck. 
9: 
The logs are on the truck, and Steve unhooks the cable 
10: 
Steve pulls the cable (as Cliff gives it slack from the 
controls) 
in order to get the cable to the next group of logs. 
11-12: 
The pulley, at the end of the beam, through which the 
cable runs that is used to hoist the logs. 
13-14: 
Logs lined up by the side of the corduroy road that are 
positioned to make the hoisting as easy as possible. 
15: 
The butt end of a cedar log. 
16-20: 
Cliff hands the 
logs 3-5 inches 
in diameter to Steve to 
be placed at the top of the load. 
These logs will be used for 
fenceposts. ( The cutting process continues on PFP83-CM0002.)

Please 
note the depth of foliage, and the balance necessary to work 
in 
this swamp while knee deep in trees and tree debris. G-Forked 
River; 49GT. 
1: 
Steve pauses while cutting limbs with axe and throws limb 
toward corduroy road. 
2-3: 
Logs after limbs have been cut off. 
Notice that limbs are 
cut so that log has no stubs afterward, just one smooth surface. 
A very difficult operation. 
4: 
Axe placed 
in stump when not in use. 
5-6: 
The thin brown stick 
in these pictures is 8 feet long 
and used by Steve to measure the trees. 
once the limbs are cut 
off they are logs. 
7-9: 
Steve uses the stick to measure logs 
in this series. 
Every two lengths he marks the 
log by notching it with his axe. 
(Refer to PFP83-BM0215661-05) 
10: 
When enough logs are notched, they are cut into 16 foot 
lengths with a chain saw. 
Here Cliff prepares to cut. 
11: 
Cliff cutting horizontally. 
12: 
Cliff holding chain saw vertically to make cut. 
13-14: 
Cliff begins a cut when point of cut is 
in the air by 
cutting from the top down. 
In 
14 he finishes the cut from the 
bottom up so the saw won't bind in the 
log, thus avoiding 
possible injury. 
15: 
Cliff trims limbs while Steve cuts lengths with his chain 
saw. 
This is as close as they get to each other while cutting. 
16: 
Steve walking on 
log and looking for next log to cut.

upper handle with their left. 
6-9: 
Before the logs are cut to 
length (and afterward) the limbs 
are taken to the corduroy road and placed on top of the logs 
there. 
This series shows Cliff doing just that. 
(For a 
description of the corduroy road see FM0001)

Also in this picture are 16 foot long 
cedar logs that have been flipped end over end or dragged to the 
side of the road, where they can be hoisted on the truck the next 
time the Frazees come to the cedar swamp. 
Also 
in

begin with pictures 
circling the building that houses the cutting machinery. 
Following this tour are slides of the milling operation itself. 
The Frazee sawmill 
is one part of tracking cedar from the swamp 
to the mill and on to people like boatbuilder Joe Reid and his 
customers. 
For more information on the Frazee cedar cutting 
operation see PFP83—CM0001-003, PFP83—BM0215661-01, 02, & 05, 
PFP83—BJC216395-06 & 11, 
and PFP83—FM0001, and PFP83—RM0014-016. 
G—Forked River; 49GT. 
1: 
Steve, 
in the distance, and his older brother roll 
logs 
into 
place for cutting on the carriage that will cut them into 4x4's, 
and lx boat lumber. 
These cedar logs were unloaded from the 
truck pictured in PFP83—CMO001/002. 
They sit on these racks 
until they are milled. 
2: 
This shot is what one sees on driving into the millyard, and 
is 45 degrees around from #1. 
You can see Steve's brother at the 
right of the photo. 
At the right are half logs that have not 
been sold and are gradually becoming unusable, too grey and too 
exposed to the weather for too long. 
On the left are 1x boards 
that also have not been bought yet. 
Behind them are stacked 
4x4's that Steve sells to a cedar shed manufacturer. 
Steve and 
his father made the lean—to that houses the mill 
in the center of 
the photo. 
3: 
Moving opposite to #1 this view shows how lumber that has 
been milled is stacked. 
Behind the 4x4's are slabs out 
especially for a cabin 
in the woods. 
These were cut to the 
specifications of a customer. 
4: 
The stack of 4x4's from behind the shed, 90 degrees from #2. 
5: 
View just to the right of #1. 
Extra racks for holding logs 
ready to be cut are 
in the foreground. 
To the right is 
the truck 
(See #6) that holds the sawdust from cutting the 
logs. 
To the 
left are the thin logs that will 
be used for fenceposts. 
In the 
distance a log sits on the carriage ready to go 
into the mill and 
through the blade. 
Also 
in the distance Steve's brother carries 
a future fencepost to 
its appropriate pile. 
6. The truck that receives the sawdust from the mill. 
The shoot 
above left on the truck carries the sawdust from the mill 
to the

truck 
7 A log that has been cut once and turned so that the cut, flat, 
side 
is down 
is readied for a second pass through the blade. 
The 
carriage, sitting on metal rails on wooden tracks, supports the 
log. 
The carriage has two vertical gauges that adjust to set the 
thickness of the cut desired. 
More about this later as we enter 
the mill 
to watch the cutting operation. 
8-9: 
Before we move into the mill, here are two more shots 
that bring us full circle to #1 position and a little to the left 
of 
it (in a position between #1 and #2). 
10-13 
A log 
is set up in front of the blade. 
At this point 
it can be checked to see that the gauge 
is set correctly. 
14: 
This 
is the same set up from a different angle (as #10). 
15: 
After an initial pass to square up the log Steve checks 
the depth of cut before making the next pass. 
16-20: 
These shots begin a series showing the first pass of a 
log through the blade. 
Steve begins in #16 by pushing the lever 
to the right with his left hand. 
In #17 the blade can be seen 
cutting what will be a slab to be brought back to the swamp and 
used to fill 
in uneven places on the corduroy road. 
#18 shows 
the slab cut along the entire length of the 
log and the grain 
pattern and knots of the soon-to-be board. 
In #19 Steve begins 
to turn handle to 
left to return log to beginning position while 
his brother moves slab to truck. 
#20 shows Steve pushing lever 
all 
the way to the left as the 
log slides back on 
its carriage.

7: 
Steve begins to move the lever to the left so 
log can return 
to starting position. 
This marks the end of this series. 
8-11: These shots show cuts along the vertical sides of what may 
end up as a 4x8 or two 4x4's. 
The opposite end of the tracks can 
be seen also, and the cable that pulls the carriage along the 
track. 
The slabs from earlier cuts are to the right of the 
track. 
Also note the shoot, diagonal board on the left, that 
takes the sawdust from 
pit under the blade to the truck shown in 
PFP83—CM0005. 
12-14: 
Here the blade 
is cutting the horizontal edges of what 
might become a 4x8 inch board. 
15-17: 
The log sitting on the carriage and being lined up (#17) 
just before passing it through the blade. 
These are similar to 
shots 
in CM0005 but are taken from inside the shed at the point 
where the 
log stops at the end of a cut before returning to 
its 
starting position.

Close-up of porch door seen in CMO(d03-12. 
14 
View to the north of the LaMonaca house on the Pine Road side. 
The red 
building is the summer kitchen. 
In front of it is a 
large tree that 
splits the sand driveway entrance in two. 
To the right is the "parking 
shed" where cucumbers and peaches are sorted according to size and packed. 
15-17 
View from Pine Road across the road from the packing shed, looking at the 
north side of the house and summer kitchen. 
18-19 
View of packing shed with storage truck backed up to it from the field 
on the other (east) side of Pine Road. 
On the left in the background is 
the "shop," the third building on the same site. 
(See AMO 
). 
Originally 
it was a 
horse barn, when horses pulled farm machinery. 
Now it houses 
parts and machinery to fix machinery that replaced horses. 
On the right 
of the packing house is the new cooling shed (see AMO 
). 
Ed LaMonaca 
and his father, Hugh, built this cooling shed a 
few years ago to replace 
the smaller one in the packing house.

01 
View from Union Road, of driveway on the west end of the house and porch, 
mentioned in CM0003-12. 
02 
View from Union Road, looking straight down driveway of 01. 
On left is 
the old baker's house and bakery (when the stage stop was in use). 
On 
right is Hugh LaMonaca's porch addition to the main house. 
In the distance 
on left is the "shop," and in the distance on right is the "packing shed." 
03 
Another view of the bakery. 
Currently the two-story section of the build-
ing is rented as an apartment; the one-story section, which used to house 
the bake ovens, is a storage area the size of a 
three-car garage. 
04 
Walking down the driveway - 
the red painted building is the summer kitchen 
that was originally attached to the stagecoach stop portion of the farm-
house. 
05-06 
View from the blue station wagon in 04, looking back out the driveway tow-
ard Union Road. 
Note the angles on the addition Hugh LaMonaca built. 
07-08 
Two shots of the old bakery from a 
point just south of the summer kitchen. 
Note the space where the old entrance to the building was, in the two-
story section. 
09-11 
Views of the west side of the bakery. 
This is a 
fascinating building. 
Note the salt-box slope to the roof-line of the one-story section and 
the way a 
piece of that roof overlaps part of the two-story section. 
This section may have been enclosed fairly recently. 
12-14 
Standing in the same area as 09-11, but facing north (parallel to Union 
Road and the driveway in 01). 
This is a 
view of two rows of tomato plants 
and the beginning of the peach orchards.

View from the packing shed, looking south across the yard to the house 
and bakery.

01 
View of south entrance to shop from the northwest corner of the main house. 
02 
Looking along the west side of the shop toward an old apple tree. 
The 
LaMonacas used to keep part of their orchards in apples, but have gradual-
ly discontinued them. 
(See AMO 
). 
Peach Orchards begin on the 
far side of the apple tree. 
03 
View of orchards on the left (west) and the south side of the shop. 
Some 
machinery, not in use at the moment, parked outside the shop. 
04-05 
View from the driveway of CM000 3, looking across the yard at the south 
and east sides of the shop, with the parking shed on the right. 
Grey peach 
crates are stacked to the left of the packing shed. 
06 
View from the west side of the shop, near the apple tree in photo 02. 
To the left of the shop is the packing shed. 
The Mexican workers have 
just brought in crates of cucumbers and are unloading them before sorting, 
packing, and shipping them out. 
07 
View of the north side of the shop with the packing house to the left. 
The pile of wood is apple cordwood. 
Ed sells this during the winter months, 
as he cuts down dead apple trees that remain on the farm. 
08-09 
Similar views, moving a little farther south with each shot. 
The building 
to the left of the packing shed in 08 is the new cooler. 
There is a con-
crete ramp between the cooler a 
nd the packing shed that can be seen on 09. 
It flattens out where the doors are, on the south aide of the cooler, to 
allow the forklift to carry crates and smaller boxes of peaches on pallets 
from the packing shed to the cooler, and vice-versa. 
On the Union Road 
(east) side of those buildings, the flat concrete platform ends abruptly, 
enabling a tractor-trailer or other truck to be loaded directly by fork-
lifts 
10 
View from the opposite (north) end of the two rows of tomato plants in 
CM000 . 
11 
View across yard of southwest corner of packing shed and east side of the 
shop. 
The ladders leaning against the crates are aluminum ladders used 
to pick peaches. 
They have a 
pole for support, instead of the usual step-
ladder frame. 
This makes it easier to get in between the tree branches, 
and closer to the trunk. 
12-13 
View of the west sides of the packing house and cooler. 
I 
am not sure 
what that red hopper is used for. 
14 
Closer view of the west sides of the packing house and cooler. 
Also visi-
ble to the right of the Dodge pickup truck is the red, metal-framed "hydro-
cooler" through which each crate of peaches passes in order to cool the 
pits to 35 °, 
before packing and storing or shipping. 
(See AMO 
.)
