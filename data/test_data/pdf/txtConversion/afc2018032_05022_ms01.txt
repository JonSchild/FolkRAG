Introduction 
0.00.30 
Grew up in Argyle (?), moved to Blanchardville (?), about twenty miles from 
Monroe. Family roots in area. 
0.01.12 
Took test in school close to graduation to test skills. A top occupation on 
interviewee’s list was LPN nursing; didn’t initially want to do that, so went to 
college for business administration and finance at UW-La Crosse. But discovered 
this was not skillset. In retrospect, might have decided on nursing earlier if had 
shadowed a nurse. Felt that nurses were mostly focused on emergency room care 
(as one might see on TV), and felt that this was not something could have done 
when younger, although views might have changed now. 
0.03.26 
Moved to La Crosse for college, met future husband, and returned home for 
family-related reasons, and later got married after return home. Worked at 
Advanced Transformer (factory work) after return home for 11 years, a firm that 
family had connections with. 
0.05.48 
After that time (around 1998), went to school and got CNA (certified nursing 
assistant), discovered this was a good career path. A friend said, “‘You know, 
Vicky, you’d make a great CNA.’ At that time you could work and get the CNA 
on the job—you didn’t have to take a separate class.” Got CNA while hired at the 
nursing home in New Glarus. Found that loved dementia ward. “I found I really 
connected with those older folks who sometimes knew who they were and 
sometimes didn’t. I really fell in love with that.” 
0.07.27 
Around 100-110 beds at the New Glarus nursing home; about 20 in dementia 
ward. This was a locked, closed ward, with a keypad, for patient safety. 
“Although we had a very very smart lady that knew what was up, and she would 
just mosey down there and watch people. And so we had to change the keypad 
several times. She wanted to get her hair done or whatever. And we’d say, ‘Oh 
there she goes again.’ And then we’d take her out—and she was just a busy girl. 
And I’m sure she was busy when she was out and about. So we’d try to do that.” 
0.09.22 
Had to take a written and skills set for CNA, proctored by an outside facility. 
0.09.46 
Loved the aspect of helping and nurturing people in this role. “If a person needed 
to be, you know, hugged or loved, I could do that. If they needed, ‘You know, you 
need to sit down right now, it’s not time for that.’ I could pull out the mother love 
and know what they need. And I was really good at entering their world when 
they needed me too—because their world maybe was not reality.” 
0.10.34 
On entering patients’ worlds: “We had one lady, and every so often she knew that 
she was still back—she had a restaurant of sorts, and this was back in the day. So 
Page 2 of 6 
 
she was feeding the men. And she would wake up, and she’d be bellowing orders: 
‘Girls, you got to feed those men!’ And you could not get her out of that mindset. 
That would be silly to even try. So, yeah, we ‘fed the men’, ‘we’ve got everything 
done’, we’ve folded the clothes. Whatever she wanted done. We were her girls—
her hired help. That kind of thing.” Another patient—originally Polish—would 
‘order a beer’. Interviewee would bring two juices, and talk to another patient, 
thinking he was drinking beer. “It was that kind of thing—entering their world 
and not trying to alter it. Because that’s where they were at the time.” 
0.12.39 
Didn’t feel a huge culture shock moving to this new role—felt that had grown up 
with these skill sets: “You grow up playing make-believe as a child. You know, I 
had imaginary friends. It’s not unusual … I had paper dolls; an imaginary world 
that you make up stories about … So that’s not so unusual. It’s just having real-
life people; it’s not that much different.” 
0.13.29 
Worked for less than 5 years at this position. Had a friend who worked at VA 
hospital, and kept going to school during day and working nights. Was hired as 
health tech at VA hospital in CCU (critical care unit). Mostly cardiac patients. 
Continued on and got LPN and RN, and at that point VA hospital in Madison did 
not hire (two-year) associate degree nurses (ADN) any more—was trying to get 
‘magnet’ status, which required a certain population of bachelor-prepared nurses. 
Worked there for quite some time, enjoying work and not wanting to lose VA 
benefits; around 2008, got RN. Went to Black Hawk Tech, taking several classes 
online, for this. A great learning experience—worked as telemetry and helper 
nurse, doing what other nurses wanted her to do. And since only four nurses on 
shift at night, got a great training jumping on and getting hands-on experience. 
0.17.23 
“A lot of hierarchy in the VA. Many of the staff are military. But I enjoyed that. I 
learned a lot of things. That was a culture shock, because I didn’t know anything 
about stuff like that—the military hierarchy, and it’s more of a big-city cultural 
thing. I worked with all kinds of different people. Down here in Monroe or New 
Glarus, it’s all ‘good ol’ boys’, Caucasian folk. And I really loved working with 
other kinds of people. And I do miss that … I miss different worldviews and 
different cultural backgrounds.” 
0.18.42 
One nurse, Deanna, knew interviewee was interested in doing many things. And 
through her, had others teach interviewee many new skills. With smaller number 
of nurses and larger number of patients, and ‘all hands on deck’ environment, 
interviewee was constantly learning new things and becoming someone to rely on. 
“I’m a doer, a hands-on learner, that’s how I learn best. If you show me, I can see 
it. And then help me do it, and I can do it. I might not be the best at it, but it takes 
practice.” 
0.20.24 
“I will tell you I was quite intimidated for quite a long time, because it was a 
hospital setting and I’d never worked in a hospital setting. The VA isn’t in itself 
large, but being connected to the UW, we’d see so many different things. But the 
patient population was wonderful—I loved them—very respectful and most of the 
time so appreciative of whatever they had. And just a wonderful camaraderie 
between them. It didn’t matter that they hadn’t met each other before. And in med 
surge (?) you’d see them visiting each other’s rooms. You wouldn’t normally see 
that. So it was that type of atmosphere I really loved. But it was intimidating, 
Page 3 of 6 
 
because of all the bells and whistles of a teaching hospital—and huge amounts of 
doctors running in packs—taking over the whole unit. And just seeing the 
hierarchy of those folks coming in.” 
0.22.01 
On in-patient side, VA doctors all UW doctors, although not on clinic side. 
0.22.43 
Left because was not getting hired, even though was not being hired. Was a 
private-duty nurse, as an RN, elsewhere, for a patient born with a brain defect, a 
‘smooth brain’, who needed a round-the-clock in-home nurse. Worked a day shift 
there, about three 12-hour shifts a week. But because this was private duty, no 
insurance associated. Working at the VA was therefore important, because of the 
benefits afforded. Found this stressful because family dynamics were very 
challenging. Family claimed patient was one of oldest living sufferers with this 
rare condition. Patient was both sweet but also headstrong and could be 
combative. Would run activities alone with this patient, and would go to family 
functions or accompany patient to appointments, to be there in case of seizures. 
0.26.01 
Found this solo experience also manageable, even though different from large-
team environment. Only family dynamics were the biggest challenge. Eventually 
decided to look for other jobs because this stress was not very manageable. 
Helped to talk informally with other nurses ‘off-line’ at the report time in between 
shifts, and to work through some of the challenges with the family directly. At 
reports, was important to check on last ‘grand mal’ seizure (?): this was helpful to 
track patient’s condition and predict what could be done in the following hours. 
Patient had difficulty walking and bathing: interviewee would walk behind her 
with a gait belt. Patient was also very nervous around water. She could talk, but 
hard to understand for outsiders. Had mental capacity of 3-5 year old. 
0.29.23 
Then took job where learned the most of any job: as a jail nurse in Dane County, 
working in corrections. “That is quite a situation—from coming in the door, 
you’re watched all the time. Of course there’s cameras everywhere. Just learning 
how you needed to be aware of your surroundings at all time.” Pass key to enter 
the door, but then having to turn all keys to security to be allowed to get on 
elevator. Required to carry walkie-talkie at all times—had never used one before. 
Also had to learn to work with deputies and to take care of inmates. A very 
different workplace culture. 2-3 nurses (including interviewee) had worked there 
for the long term (about 2 years or more—a lot of staff turnover). Medical team 
consisted of one doctor, one mental health doctor, and one dentist. 
0.32.34 
Procedure: inmates would give in a slip if they wanted to be seen by nursing 
staff—this was ‘nurse call’. And then after nurse assessment, the nurse could put 
a patient on the ‘doctor call’ list. A new experience: passing a huge amount of 
meds twice a day; this required a large amount of organization, and knowing how 
to be safe. Inmates could sometimes try to exploit and “get what you had—
everything in jail is a commodity and anything can be traded and used for 
whatever else they needed”. Felt that her “rural street smarts” didn’t let her know 
what the “hierarchy of the game was”; learned from how other inmates treated 
certain people about the hierarchy. Inmates would sometimes try to get nurses to 
take something to other cell blocks. A large amount of training—e.g., not to talk 
to inmates. A ‘hands-off’ type of environment. Would see “some of the worst 
conditions in jail, because inmates just didn’t take care of themselves … and that 
Page 4 of 6 
 
would be on top of their drug or alcohol abuse”. Interviewee was the ‘Huber 
nurse’, to do with work release for (largely non-violent) inmates. “The worst cell 
block was the female seg (segregation). This was my opinion, but I’m sure others 
would agree … These are locked down and you only get one hour out a day. And 
they’re just manipulative, behavioral, nasty women. And they have mental health 
issues.” These cells were about 7x8. “But there was many times when a deputy 
would be called and you’d have to run. One of the major times was when a female 
was acting out, and a deputy would have to hold them down, and we’d have to 
give ‘held-all’ (?) in the hip—an injection.” Another instance involved removing 
a ligature that had been around an inmate’s neck. A lot of physical exertion in 
running to and from emergency cases. In some cases, inmates needed care after 
being pepper-sprayed or Tased—checking wounds were okay and inmate was 
stable or else call ambulance and give directions.  
0.39.36 
On day shifts, two nurses would be on shift per building—e.g., maximum 
security, medium security—for med pass. And then at night just one nurse would 
be on shift. But around the clock would be the ‘intake nurse’. Interviewee did not 
like working as intake nurse. “You had a bunch of inmates that came in, the salad 
port (?). And sometimes you had 15 people waiting for you. And you had to get 
all this information, and inmates were, as you can imagine, not very happy to be 
there. There was quite a hullabaloo in that area.” Preferred working in ‘male seg’, 
with withdrawal patients who weren’t fit to go to general population or were 
waiting to go to court. In all interactions, nurse would be accompanied by 
deputy—except at ‘Huber center’. Interviewee was last nurse to be alone with any 
inmate because of being threatened once in a way that was very upsetting to 
interviewee. 
0.41.47 
Discussion of ‘Huber jail’. Learned a lot about what deputies do in this capacity. 
0.44.25 
On relationships between deputies and medical staff: “You had to be careful with 
deputies. They would throw you under the bus … If something went wrong, it 
wasn’t their fault; it was yours.” Would sometimes “get an attitude, like ‘That’s 
not my job.’ They had an attitude, most of them. Does that color my attitude of 
deputies in general? Yeah, it does.” Helped interviewee see how racial prejudice 
might develop or be sustained in deputies: “I hope I’m not like that, but I might 
be—I don’t know … I check myself all the time to see, ‘Oh, was I judgmental?’ 
But I do—I look at people’s charts, and I don’t necessarily look to see if they’re 
black or white, but I look to see how old they are or their height and weight. 
When they’re complaining about something, does that bring in something of their 
cultural background?” Interviewee didn’t realize that there was geographical 
differences in educational experiences—“I just figured everybody was the same, 
until you get out in the world” and discovered different educational experiences. 
0.48.39 
“I think that—I hate absolutes like everyone or anyone—but everyone is there and 
it can stem back from a mental-health type problem. If you’re there and on your 
third OWI, you have substance abuse, which can lead back to mental health.”  
0.49.32 
Also worked in Green County jail—smaller than Dane County, which had federal 
inmates, who had different place in jail hierarchy. 
0.50.27 
Felt that inmates who were unpleasant to nursing staff was a strong  indicator of 
serious mental health problems. In general, inmates understood that nursing staff 
Page 5 of 6 
 
was there to help them. Nursing staff could also advocate on their behalf to 
deputies. 
0.51.42 
Not entirely all-female nursing staff. But very positive treatment of nurses, 
regardless of gender, by inmates. “And we always had to do an intake exam. And 
that’s where I got my assessment skills really down pat. Because we had to do a 
full intake assessment on an inmate.” A full test, including TB skin test. “And I 
would dismiss inmates if they were being—some of them hadn’t settled in. And I 
would be like, ‘I’m sorry, but one more time and you’re out of here.’ And I would 
get apologies.” “You couldn’t have friends. There was one nurse who was 
dismissed—she was being too friendly to one of the inmates.” 
0.54.06 
Worked at jail for three years. But did not feel safe—was sometimes even 
escorted to car from door. “I was always nervous, and I didn’t realize how 
nervous I was. I had GI problems—losing weight, all these things. I was just so 
nervous all the time. And it took me quite a long time of being out of jail before I 
wasn’t compelled to have some sort of usable weapon in my hand when I was 
outside a building.” Had to learn to read subtle signs and changes—e.g., a deputy 
driving on the parking ramp or meeting interviewee at the door to be escorted. 
“But I learned a lot—I did learn a lot. I did dental assessments—I hadn’t known 
anything about teeth—but then I had to make the determination whether they had 
to go to the dentist or not.” “It was hard work but I learned a lot, but I couldn’t do 
the job I do today if I hadn’t done that.” 
0.58.13 
Now works as a triage nurse. “I was never so happy as when they called me.” 
Hired as a ‘float’: ‘floating’ to every department, so every day could be different. 
“I love that, because I like different things. I like to learn different things, and a 
lot of things.” “I picked the float pool because I don’t like to sit still. And now 
I’m the triage nurse, on the phone all the time—which was a wonderful 
adventure, because there wasn’t a triage nurse before me, so I kind of developed 
the job.” 
1.00.26 
Need for a triage nurse role came from a new call center. Began as a small center 
in 2015, and now expanding. Performed dual role, dealing with emergencies and 
also fielding calls as needed. “I’m the RN—they affectionately call me ‘doc’.” 
“They have a list of symptoms people call in on where they have to have a 
nurse—shortness of breath, etc.—there’s a list of 30 or more symptoms that the 
PRR has to have a nurse triage. So I take those calls. So I’m quite busy. Also I do 
follow-up calls with folks who have been in the emergency room (for people who 
don’t have a primary care provider)”. Also works as “watchdog” for e-visits, 
using Skype to make sure patients are assigned. 
1.04.33 
E-visits a relatively new program. Sometimes a challenge to get patients assigned 
to a provider. “I like technology … I like to find out about it, and I’m learning it 
bit by bit. There was one computer in high school but you couldn’t get close to it, 
because all the boys were hovering around it.” Dane County jail had no electronic 
charting. At Green County jail, had been no medical staff previously, so 
interviewee set up whole medical system. VA had very elaborate medical records 
system. Some humor at jail—when inmates were booked for 100th time—and had 
huge paper charts. At Green County, were progressive in trying to set up a 
charting system that would work for deputies.

1.10.47 
On the intersection of nursing and mental health: “It struck me as kind of funny 
that it would be an intersection, because in my view every phone call I have, 
every encounter I have, is a mental health encounter. You’re working with the 
patient—you can’t pull out the medical aspect or the physical. They’re connected 
to their spirit or their soul. So their mental health plays a part in every encounter I 
have. So whether it’s the last person I talked to today before I left having a very 
hard time with a physical condition but yet it was the barrier of her mental health 
that she was having a terrible time expressing what was going on with her. And so 
I had to pull out my dementia hat, and say, ‘It’s okay if you can’t tell me.’ And I 
would ask her and she could say ‘yes’ or ‘no’, because she was having a terrible 
time with word-finding. She could tell me, No, her husband wasn’t home, and 
Yes, she’s safe … She wanted to, but she was struggling. And I didn’t want to 
push her, because she knew she was struggling. And I would say, ‘You’re safe 
right now. And I’ll call you tomorrow.’ So every encounter I have has mental 
health involved. 
 
 
Last week a patient called having … missed his appointment. He realized 
his appointment was missed and he had a meltdown because he ‘failed’. So then 
all these things were coming up on him. He ‘failed’ this, he fell asleep. So I said, 
‘We’re not mad.’ … ‘Oh my goodness, my dog has cancer. My mom died of 
cancer.’ So I ended up talking to him, and I needed the PRR call 911, because he 
gave me all the reasons he didn’t want to live. He didn’t have plan. But he was 
struggling. So we had to get the authorities, and we worked together to get a 
deputy over there. So that’s a major explanation—a major thing where nursing 
and mental health are together. Sometimes we’re back and forth, over a river, a 
stream that’s coming in and out.’ 
1.14.30 
“We get many medication questions. Well—‘I need a refill of major medication.’ 
‘Well, do you realize you can call your pharmacy?’ … You need to enter their 
level of education. And I consider that also mental health. Some people get in 
right away and some people can’t wrapped their head about it … ‘Oh yeah, now I 
understand it.’ And that’s mental health too—that education.” 
1.15.55 
“And some of these curmudgeonly older gentlemen, I have to give it to them 
straight. And sometimes you have understand between the lines. Is it because 
they’re hurting that they’re so ornery? Are they so OCD that they’re not going to 
hear you anyway because this doesn’t make sense to them? Are they chauvinist? 
I’m a woman. You usually can tell right away—how they’re talking, how they’re 
expressing themselves.”
