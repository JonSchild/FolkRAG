Introduction

Gardening not huge part of childhood. Parents always had small garden. 
Grew up in older suburb in NJ with yards and trees. In 1960 and 70s still 
fair amount of farms there. Always had local veggies and parents loved to 
cook, but not a huge interest of his growing up. More interested in games, 
sports, grew up in neighborhood with lots of kids and played outside a lot. 
Have older brother and older sister. Sister lives in Calais, brother down the 
coast, only one farming. Dad was a lawyer, mom worked for university in 
publications, then managed estate of Benny Goodman. Dad was excited 
about him farming, though they were curious and concerned as well. First 
time parents visited his farm saw why he loved it so much. Growing up 
didn’t have a clue about his future. Loved working with animals when 
younger, but faded as he got older. Graduated from high school, went to 
some college in upstate NY but dropped out because didn’t know what he 
wanted to do. Went to Colorado for a few years to work in mountains, got 
healthier, but didn’t love being far from family on east coast. Came back to

UMass Amherst, saw farming as potential reality. Studied environmental 
design and became interested in breadth of work in that field. Like idea to 
form Appalachian Trail. Was influenced by environmental writing, and had 
housemate from China who shared her parents perspectives on land from 
their life in China. Wendell Berry’s “Unsettling of America” greatly impacted 
him. Realized he was in great valley for farming in western MA and had 
opportunity to farm and run a business there. In young 20s, had a lot of 
questions about his life. What is community? Wanted to connect different 
threads of what he was seeing, Berry’s writing helped him do that and 
started paying more attention to agriculture in the area. 
00:11:16-00:16:35 
At 24 years old attended talk on agriculture and health by biodynamic 
farmer. Asked farmer if he would teach what he knew, Satz went to work on 
their new farm as an intern. Had no background in agriculture or using farm 
equipment, but made good relationship with farmer and instantly loved the 
work. Worked there summer 1989 in Hatfield, MA. “I hadn’t realized at the 
time that I was basically eating chocolate cake for my farming breakfast, so I 
kind of thought that’s what soil was. It was years later when I left that area 
where people would scream at me when they found out that I had 
voluntarily left that area.” “But it was something just that completely caught 
every part of my being. Taking the vegetables, planting them, growing them, 
all the way through harvest – there was everything about it that I loved. As 
well as the marketing - every Saturday we’d do the farmers market down in 
Northampton and that was like a day off. It was a blast to go down there and 
sell your wares.” Sold some to restaurants but most to farmers market. 
Planned on working there again, but that farmer ended up supporting his 
wife’s business more than the farm and lent Satz their farm to continue 
their work. A great opportunity. Many growers in that area, very helpful and 
supportive. Only one older neighbor and grower who didn’t believe in 
biodynamic practices.

Many different preparations and nettle stews in biodynamic farming. One of 
first days he picked dandelions to stuff into a stag bladder and brewing 
them. Haven’t used those preparations in several years, but was big part of 
opening his eyes to breadth of agriculture possibilities. Steiner had infinite 
wisdom on agriculture connecting to human life. Had approach for 
rehabilitating soils and agriculture, was sought to help Germany and 
Austria. Steiner had 7 or 8 lectures that are pinnacle of his work. Had big 
influence on Satz. “I see nothing but incredible vibrancy on the farms that 
follow biodynamic practices. There’s quite a few hybrid groups out there. I 
think when I was younger I used to think of it as more than organic; I no 
longer see it as black and white. He has a very strong influence on approach 
towards agriculture just as any of the many versions of organic agriculture 
that are out there, or conventional. And I honestly have learned as much if 
not more from a lot of conventional farmers as I have from organic. There’s 
a lot more similar than there is dissimilar.”

Farm that started out on was biodynamic, but owner didn’t have time to 
evolve the land. Wanted land to keep going with those practices in mind. A 
year later met other grower nearby who was more focused on wholesale. 
Satz brought retail and diversity skills to combine businesses with his scale 
and equipment. Continued Northampton markets and restaurant 
relationships, expanded to Boston markets, first Brookline, very good urban 
markets. Used wholesale accounts David had going. Combined all efforts 
between the businesses. First time building a greenhouse, growing own 
starts. There for a few years, but Satz wanted to focus on retail and partner 
more on wholesale. Parted ways. Took a few years away from agriculture to 
visit other interests. “It was several years later before I got back into 
farming, but I came into it a little bit slowly knowing that I really only 
wanted to get involved if I could own land, or at least have that promise of 
having that ownership. So I did not want to – there’s often not a lot of cash,

or there’s not lot of equity often in farming, so I saw in my own experience 
and in other friends where you could work for years and after, if 
circumstances didn’t continue positive, you can kind of end up with nothing. 
And I had just seen enough of that to say no you know I’d like to go towards 
having a farm and owning a place. So I did want to do it I just went back at it 
slowly and kind of defined more what I wanted.” Worked for other growers, 
and for NOFA inspections. Helped run farm at school in Vershire. Had mixed 
farm with veggies and grazing animals. Defined the kind of agriculture he 
wanted to stay with over time. 
00:23:49-00:25:31 
Had one year to learn from Clifford’s farm in MA, next year on his own. 
“Anyone can put some seeds in the ground.” Used seed guide to learn basics, 
but had to pick up details and nuances over time. “The rocket science isn’t in 
any one crop – it’s how to put it all together. And it’s still not rocket science, 
but it was a learning curve.” Orchestrating crops comes over time. Preferred 
lots of crops at same time and trying to keep up with it all.

Started looking for land when left Mountain School in Vershire. Sister was 
already living in Vermont near Milton and Georgia, used to visit her and 
loved coming to VT. When older, came up here for camping, backpacking. 
When came back from living out west, knew western MA very similar to 
southern Vermont. “A lot of the growing community, the ag community, is a 
very vigorous and friendly and social group of people, so the winter 
conferences you’re always meeting growers from different places.” Going to 
Vershire cemented connection to Connecticut River Valley. Had friends in 
Brattleboro, Putney. Started looking further from MA based on affordability, 
southern VT had very expensive land. Looked for land between jobs. 
Financially was a trick, had to afford borrowing money for land in good 
enough place to support your business. “Over time I came to the feeling that 
I really wanted to have a farm stand. That just became I think, as much as a I 
enjoyed going to farmers markets – loved going to farmers markets – I

didn’t want that to be the bread and butter of the business. The setting up, 
the – at least when you’re not doing a lot of markets in a week - I don’t know 
if pressure is the right word, but it has to be a nice day because your 
business rises and falls with the weather. And it’s going to do that anyway 
but when you go to a farmers market it hinges on that one day.” Can spread 
that risk by going to markets every day, but setting up also exhausting. 
Doing NOFA inspections brought him to a lot of new places in VT, and got to 
see a lot of different models in vegetable farming. It’s hard to figure out 
exactly what you do and don’t like about others’ operations, but farms with 
farm stands felt like the best overall setup. When started looking at land, 
kept farm stand idea. Can have farm stand off-site, but on-site is ideal. Heard 
about his current farm for sale from friends, met Bob and Sally selling 
Wood’s Farm on inspection in Brandon. Purchased later on. Loved getting to 
know Bob and Sally, treasured that transition. Became friends over a few 
years before buying the land. Met Bob in the cornfield, met Sally, got a tour 
of their farm, instantly wanted to be there in his long-term future. Had a lot 
of acreage, buildings, didn’t know if could afford it financially and labor. Met 
them in 1997. Kept in touch after meeting them but never talked about 
buying the farm, knew the price was above what we could afford. Continued 
to look for land but things kept falling through. Was working with MA 
Extension in 1999, grant let him contract work with them but with intention 
of long-term. A week after taking that grant and agreeing to work, found out 
people set to buy Wood’s Farm backed out a few days before closing. Bob 
and Sally offered it to him, was a big surprise, but wanted to go see Bob and 
Sally to discuss it. Hadn’t seen farm when farm stand was open based on 
seasons, came during harvest season in September and knew it was 
everything he was looking for. Had known Vermont Land Trust, worked 
with them to get creative financing across multiple groups and worked to 
buy farm by that fall. Bob and Sally really didn’t want business to shut

down, everyone was ready to make commitment. Happened quickly but 
strongly. 
00:36:21-00:44:42 
When bought current property, was really 2 farms. Small home farm that 
Bob grew up on with about 50 acres of woodland, meadows, only 10 of that 
in production. Had 100+-year-old house that had some renovations. 
Multiple old barns, farm stand with infrastructure. Also other farm as 
security blanket of extra land to secure business in case something 
happened to the land. Bob and Sally made commitment in late 1980s with 
H-2A program to employ seasonal foreign workers once their kids left the 
farm. Many orchards use this too. Part of H2A requires provided housing. 
Created small living area on other farm, so got those buildings too. Roughly 
100 acres with 25-30 tillable land, plus house, barn, farm stand, and labor 
housing. From what he was used to, was large enough. Had done 25 acres 
with Dave doing wholesale crops, worked for much larger operations, but 
personally had not run much larger farm. Depends on your labor force. 
Looking at land previously, would either be good land and bad house or vice 
versa. Got fussier because saw pieces of what he wanted but not the whole. 
Wanted house set back from road but access to good road for business. Now 
have exactly that with farm stand on Route 7. A lot more sense of privacy 
than living on road. Feel very fortunate to have come into this land. Their 
legacy was growing quality vegetables and having good relationship with 
customers and community. Big shoes to fill but so much support to continue 
business. Bob and Sally moved into other house and were very helpful with 
the transition.

On first day meeting Sally, was asked what he would do. Wanted to add 
greenhouses for early tomatoes, more fruits. Can understand limits of 
making change for long-term things on farm. Their business worked for 
them, but at time Jon had room to make changes. Wanted to work in 
greenhouses. Since vegetable business as established and successful,

wanted to start the greenhouses for tomatoes. Had unconventional 
agreement. Didn’t close until January, but best time to build greenhouse is 
before ground freezes. Was working 3 other part-time jobs, came up 1-2 
days a week to build first 2 greenhouses in fall 1999 before owning the 
farm. Lived into house Bob and Sally would live in after closing. Helped each 
other with the transition. Bob was in legislature and busy in winter, so they 
switched houses before closing. Very simple with everyone on the same 
page, worked really well. Shared growing records, but everyone grows 
differently. But nice to understand how they used the land. Also shared 
weather books Sally made, with minimum, maximum, and comment on 
weather every day from 1960-2000. Helpful in knowing patterns. A lot of 
planning over first winter. Waited in bedding plants first years because too 
hard to start everything at once. Focused on early tomatoes plus growing 
own field starts. Changed farm stand a bit, but didn’t want to completely 
redo it. Wanted to add other products that weren’t from farm to create 
more of a market including baked goods, cheese, fruit, to make it easier for 
people to come and do full shopping but with focus on farm’s produce. “You 
do whatever you can do in the winter, and I did that year to get it all ready, 
because the train leaves in late April, early May and you just hang on, which 
is what that first year, or two or three, felt like – still does.” 
00:51:21-00:57:28 
2000 was first growing year at Wood’s Farm. End of 2000 met worker Elsie 
Cheryl who still works on farm. Also put up two more greenhouses for 
bedding plants by that fall. Spring 2001 Beth Wimmet started working there 
and is now greenhouse manager. “The people here is a big part of it.” 
Business grew a lot in first few years, bedding plant business wide open. Put 
up more greenhouses each year, by 2007 had 7 greenhouses with ½ acre of 
covered space. April 2007 had windstorm that wrecked a lot of 
greenhouses. Fall 2007 started rebuilding greenhouses with better 
construction based on their needs. Now have nicer peak-net greenhouses.

Having better greenhouses is a big benchmark because can control 
environment better. Met wife Courtney in 2008, her mom was one of his 
first customers. Started family on farm, have 2 little boys, has changed 
things significantly. Road construction on Rt. 7 is least favorite benchmark. 
Had 2 years of hell from that, second year had personal bout with cancer 
and was very challenging. Now Jon and road better, but economy is not. In 
those years were a lot of challenges, made him look strongly at business as a 
whole. Had gone from years of growth to dropped business. Brandon had 
lost a lot of jobs, gas prices doubled so not as many customers from Rutland. 
Economic changes impacted who was able to shop at farm stand and how 
often. Decided only way to support business was to look at outside markets, 
especially positive wholesale markets, in 2008-2009, because farm stand 
would not grow. Added capacity to grow more acreage, rent 50 acres from 
neighbor. Certified about 50 acres organic each year recently. Coming to 
Wood’s farm became worth it to obtain organic certification in 2009-2010 
for wholesale markets to obtain premium. Farmed organically but without 
certification before that. 2014 hit goal where half of produce was sold at 
farm stand and half sold off-farm, either through CSA or wholesale accounts. 
Wanted that diversity so wouldn’t be entirely dependent on farm stand. 
00:57:28-01:02:58 
Middlebury Co-op is single largest wholesale account. Once certified, could 
go to them and step up in their priorities. They’re very focused on local and 
organic. Officially would have been called conventional even though 
growing organic, so certification helped a lot. Jon selling directly to them. 
Great people to work with. “They’re actually a tremendous group to work 
with. They’re completely opposite from my previous wholesale experience 
down with a distributor down in Massachusetts. It’s very one to one, it’s box 
to box, it’s very much a two-way conversation, which is great. It’s not just 
numbers, ordering this and that.” Primary off-farm CSA is project with two 
other growers, Justin Rich in Huntington and Erin in Warren and Waitsfield,

the Kingsbury Market Garden, and the three together created the Muddy 
Boots CSA. A collaborative CSA. Have 150 people in Warren, 250+ in Canton, 
MA where they send weekly shares. Started 3-4 years ago with 100 
members, has been significant part of off-farm income. The three work as 
one farm. Each grower focuses on their own specialties, go into year with 
rough plan of what they want to grow and how much, put together rough 
outline of the share. Box everything themselves, aggregate products at 
Erin’s place, have one distribution center there on Wednesdays. Thursday 
morning rent a box van from Burlington with driver who takes CSA to 
Canton to drop off share. They ship whole crates, don’t bag individual bags. 
Shareholders come and have list of what they get, sometimes with choices, 
and make their own bags. Really helpful that they don’t do individual 
bagging. Do similar format in farm stand in fall. Run CSA in fall after farm 
stand closes, lay out stations for people who signed up to build their own 
share often with choices.

“Part of what I love is the diversity of it. Part of what I hate is the diversity of 
it. It’s the bane of our existence – it’s the fun and challenge of it. It’s part of 
the most difficult things, it’s hard to not get scattered and hard to do a really 
good job on all these different things.” Corn, strawberries, and tomatoes are 
each about a quarter of income, all other things that take up 90% of space in 
farm stand is only 25% of income. “They’re not hobbies. You’re trying to 
make a living, you’re trying to actually make an income while you’re doing 
these things you enjoy. But it’s more, it’s increasingly difficult when you’re 
doing smaller amounts of things. There’s no way to get around economies of 
scale, and yet it’s the small attention to detail work that is also enjoyable. 
It’s kind of the little niches of what we do in a day that are fun.” But can’t 
ignore main crops because they are the income. Seed order in spring of 
flowers and vegetables is now around 600-800 kinds of seeds. Are experts 
at being novice Excel users to keep track of what they’re doing. “I still do

quite a bit of harvesting; there’s some crops that I don’t ever touch. I’m a 
grower, but I’m usually setting up the work for someone else or moving on 
to the next thing. It’s a lot of orchestrating is what I do as the manager, 
owner, whatever you want to call it, is keeping the whole train running. And 
so there’s some things that are just by nature delegated or just done better 
by people other than me.” Has to pick slowly because can get very 
distracted. Guys that come up through H-2A program are so good at staying 
on task. They each have favorite crops to pick whether or not they like to 
eat it. “Everyone pretty much here has a lot of pride in what we put out. 
What we love, all the work and everything, it’s so wonderful to have the 
farm stand – especially because that’s right in your face – but to have it all, 
see it go out, and not just in a box going out.” CSAs and Co-op give great 
feedback that makes it worth it.  
01:08:00-01:10:25 
More challenging in VT to stay connected to grower community than in 
western MA, due to location and geography. Brandon has low population 
and not a lot of great growing land. Not a lot of nearby vegetable growers. In 
western MA had big population, great land, and a lot of growers nearby. Not 
possible here. Share stories over time, listservs to communicate over email 
with vegetable growers group in VT, but become friends with people you 
reach out to with helpful advice, have common experience, winter 
conferences, farm tours in summer, word of mouth, exchanging equipment, 
etc. “It’s not a secret to know there’s roughly, or less than 1% of the people 
are actually on a day to day basis growing food, so there’s that automatic 
brotherhood or sisterhood that your shared experience and it’s not as 
common as it used to be. So I think people seek out that little common is 
when you do cross paths with people who do it.”

about it. In 70s, no one had corn until August, where now people race to 
have it earlier. “More and more people grew past their local, and this is 
going back in time now, and started shipping, and your grocery stores 
started bending the rules of what’s in season. It’s been one slow croddle like 
get anything you want any time. So, like a frog boiling in water, that 
happened increasingly so over the last 30 years. I remember growing up 
even in New Jersey just eating in the summer from these farm stands. That’s 
not really the case except for a few exceptions anymore. But, these 
incredible grocery stores that make it like you’re in a farm stand – you don’t 
even know what season it is sometimes. But I’d be the first to say they do a 
heck of a lot better job than they did even 10 years ago. I mean produce has 
become a much more focused-on thing in a lot of stores in a quality kind of 
way. So Sally had been telling a story of how, yeah, you know people 
wouldn’t buy the corn unless it was local, not just us, but they would wait. 
People would wait. They didn’t go buy it in a grocery store, they wouldn’t 
buy it if it was shipped up from a farm in the Hudson Valley, they’d wait. 
The first big week was always like the first weekend in August, and she goes 
there’d be a line up Route 7, up past the little cabins up the road here, a 
quarter mile up the road of just people coming in when the corn here finally 
came in. That people honored it a lot more back in the day because it’s what 
they knew and there was a lot more pride. And, as the supermarket 
mentality, whether it be fresh, or frozen, or whatever, it became less special. 
And I think only in the last, especially like you’re saying in the last 10 years, 
where it’s just become sexy again to kind of pay attention to it – I don’t 
think it’s anything new. You know there’s a lot of press that comes on from 
the younger set growing, which is really fascinating and wonderful to see a 
lot of younger people get into growing. There’s this incredible group of 
people that started farming in the 70s and 80s who didn’t have a 
background doing it, kind of part of that Back to the Land movement. And

they became for one reason or another, depending on opportunities, 
growers, and that became their vocation and profession. And there was 
never this huge pat on the back; they’re kind of these like quiet mentors. 
And occasionally they’ve gotten accolades I think they deserved, but the 
way the media works now is a lot more attention on sort of  the younger 
things coming up, which is positive but it’s interesting to see a lot of the 
people who laid that ground work now for what is so popular, quieter. I 
think it’s part of our culture now, a little bit more, ‘Ta-da’, look at me kind of 
thing.” Lots of growers who have been doing it for a long time, running 
incredible businesses.

Need for urgency may not be best way to address local food movement. 
Regarding producing and consuming local food, “It’s as important as any 
language. There’s a skillset to it. There’s something so phenomenally 
tangible. I mean what person doesn’t put on a big smile and feel really good 
biting into something fresh in the middle of the summer, or in winter 
something stored and cooked well. I mean food is such a universal language, 
and an important language that can be I’d say the accent of the local 
agriculture. And agriculture has, it is so much a part of our heritage, and it’s 
always going to be a part of our future.” But may not always be understood 
and appreciated very well. “I think there’s a lot more sustenance and 
aliveness that can come out of the whole local food, I don’t want to use the 
word economy, but that whole momentum that has really kind of regained 
some of its own momentum. And I think a lot of it is just people willing to 
listen to it. I wouldn’t be surprised if it sometimes fades or sometimes gets 
stronger in different ways – I don’t know how it’s going to go.”

Dairy has more cows now than ever before, but just a fraction of the farms 
milking them. In 1950s were 11,000 dairy farms, now fewer than 1,000. 
Only have 6-7% of people involved in dairy, hardly anyone. Vegetable 
farming has small seasonal spike, highly perishable so don’t typically use 
distributor. So much energy behind it because of the short season, if had 
longer seasons would probably take away the explosion of interest in crops. 
Vegetable industry wouldn’t lend itself to big producers or distributors, 
don’t have distribution and population to support other than micro 
enterprises. Some places better at larger production, if distribution 
improves could reach more Boston markets. California farmers live in 
country and market to city, even if several hours away. Boston and NYC 
very close to VT, has that same potential.

people, now not so clear. More complex now to form an opinion. All food 
comes from farms somewhere, even if it’s not local. There are different 
advantages to buying local, but those stores still have to meet their needs in 
an economy of scale. Farmers won’t get farmers market prices at wholesale 
level, so might have challenge getting bigger if only stay with that. 
Wholesale is a very different kind of market, need to increase production 
but won’t get as big a price. Every producer has to find their niche market 
and decide what kind of business and life is important to them. Many 
growers didn’t grow up doing it, so have to find your path as you go along. 
Leaves a lot of room for creativity, especially with younger producers

because they don’t personally have precedents for how they should do 
things. Invent business as they go along, brings you to really interesting 
nuances of farming. Will always be new small growers, some will stay small, 
others will grow, others will drop out. “Land is clearly one of the biggest 
challenges, access to land.” Have to gain knowledge from your network, and 
experience only comes with time. Capacity is more important on 
consumers’ end, growers can step up to it when consumers ready. Some 
areas have more support than others, especially working institutions into 
their market. Interest in supporting local food is newer, trying to bridge the 
gap between retail-focused producers and wholesale-focused buyers. 
Bigger buyers have lower budgets, hard to produce at their scales, but 
institutions are making strides to include local food. Some schools doing 
great job of working with local growers. UVM Medical Center tries really 
hard.

Occasionally read Wendell Berry, but could revisit him again. Turning 50 
this year, becoming more reflective but has lack of time given family. 
Always relevant though. Berry also has other great non-ag related reading. 
Will always appreciate Berry’s ability to verbalize connection with farming.

Never had explicit list of future needs, definitely had goals but maybe not 
clearly laid out. Fall under worker bee category, work is satisfying. Probably 
first summer on Clifford’s farm realized that. “I noticed really quickly, 
subconsciously or over the table consciously, that it’s a work that keeps you 
very honest. If you don’t go do something, it shows. If you don’t go water 
that, that can die. You don’t take care of that, that dies. It’s driving in and of 
itself, and so there’s a discipline that comes from it. If you have the goal of or 
the enjoyment of what the results are as being good, you’ve  got to do the 
work.” Work comes in many different forms, many different steps, but you 
get to feel the season. Envies orchardists because have season but trees last 
a lifetime. Vegetable farming is life and death every season, no final goal

because always ongoing. Challenge and exhaustion at end of season, 
sometimes don’t know if can do it again, especially in winter, but energy 
always comes back in spring. Didn’t plan that drive and interest. None of his 
recent generations did this in family, a lot of friends who are growers didn’t 
grow up doing it either, but worker bee nature keeps it going. “Nothing too 
fancy or mysterious about it on some level, you bring your personality and 
your drive to it and you get a lot of different interpretations of it.” Many 
small joys in work, sometimes hard to completely stop and enjoy it because 
always moving forward, but get used to it. A rush to get through season and 
have it go well, deal with challenges of weather, economics, but still come 
out successfully on a lot of different levels. Economics always a driver 
because if not successful there, can’t succeed on other levels, so always part 
of the business. Probably why younger growers more focused on balance 
between business and growing, will keep them in business longer.
