Dear Bess:
 
Got your FAX last week and your letter today. Thanks for all
 
the kind thoughts.
 
Be
.  the AFS Annual Meeting, Folly and I
 
discussed the wisdom of your suggestion about holding off
 
until next year's confab,  then decided to go ahead with the
 
proposed panel this year anyway. For a number of reasons
 
(
1) the panel topic fits into this year '
e conference theme.
 
"Transnational Articulations";  (2) Folly may not be in the
 
Virgin Islands next year;  (3) we're both hot for the idea
 
and Judy is willing to do a paper that should fit right  in
 
Also,  I feel an urge to get back and see my 86-year old
 
Mother in Buffalo--a side trip that I can tack onto
 
Jacksonville--and I think I can get the trip funded by CFAC
 
while I am still associated with the Arts Council.
 
As I think I told you,  I am not yet permanently out of
 
the picture at the Arts Council. Tile has managed--for the
 
time being--to shoehorn me into the budget at half time and
 
half pay.  (Of course, the job is still pretty much still
 
fulltime, so I just work at double the pace.) But then,  when
 
she retires at the end of this month and is replaced,  there
 
is no t
elling what will happen.
 
I have managed to get some
 
short-term funding for Le Vaomatua, and they have agreed to
 
hire me (the other) half time as office manager, and I have
 
landed a couple of short term consultant and environmental
 
curriculum writing jobs through Le Vaomatua that keep me
 
busy and generate occasional paychecks.  It's a transition
 
period.  I
've been through these before. The Arts Council gig
 
allows me to keep this (busted) housing for the time being.
 
I
'm really not too worried.  I rather enjoy transition
 
periods--as,  I gather, you are enjoying your current one.
 
If I could stay on at the Arts Council, being paid part
 
time to run the Folk Arts Program,  the Master/Apprentice
 
program,  writing their grants, and doing their
 
correspondence that would be fine.  It all depends on who the
 
next E
.D.  is. The truth is that the regional environmental
 
work through Le Vaomatua has been getting at least half my
 
heart and energies the past year or so. There is so much I
.e
 
do,  it is so urgent, and the thicket of politics is so
 
thick.
 
Of course, neither job understands that it is part
 
time,  and so they have become rather rose-and-briar-bush
 
intertwined.  (For instance, Greenpeace has asked me to
 
commission art work from my folk carver Sven Ortquist, and
 
Le Vaomatua is sponsoring talks and studies on traditional
 
methods of resource management
 
About the Pacific Arts Festival in Rarotonga: after the
 
Governor declined Tile's request to appoint me as the next,
 
or at least interim, Arts Council E
.D.  (because I am not
 
Samoan) and my reduction to part-time status and my total
 
failure to get any local support for a canoe-building
 
program for the Cook Island Festival,  I began to sense that
 
I was somewhat marginal to the next version of the Arts
 
Council.  I am very afraid that the Arts Council's mandate
 
and programs may return to the level of local political
 
ball-bouncing, ala CNNI and here under Brownie.  I will do
 
all I can to have a respect4ble Samoan craft and performance
 
presentation in Raro, but the writing on the wall says that
 
in the end I probably wouldn 't get to go, would be the first
 
expendable when it came to getting a seat on the plane.  (
In
 
truth,  I am also not a fan of large events, huge unknowing
 
crowds, and multiple venues. When recently offered a
 
delegate's post to the UNCED "Earth Summit" in Rio be
 
Janiero in June,  I demurred and proposed Sinavaiana
 
instead.)
 
The Pacific Arts Festival is a great show, probably
 
one of the best;  I enjoyed it--in retrospect--tremendously
 
in Australia four years ago.  It was one of the more intense
 
weeks of my life. But unless realities here turn out quite
 
differently than I expect,  I won't he there. Which is
 
another reason I opted for Jacksonville.
 
I
t
 late at nigJt
. and I have a miserable unid.  There is
 
something about having a "cold" in the tropics that is
 
disorienting. The boy is asleep. Sinavaiana has been up in
 
Honolulu the past several months,  trying to finish up her
 
dissertation and its defense. No idea when or if she'll he
 
back. Four nights hence I
'll he travelling up there myself
 
to represent Pacific environmental NGC)s at a conference on
 
oceans and the environment  I still have a statement to
 
write and FAX about that tonight before I join the boyc in
 
dreamsville.  (
I've been putting it off by writing you.)
 
OK,  so you won't make it to Samoa on this trip into the
 
southern salty waters--which seems a shame and a waste of a
 
trip to the antipode--but when will you get here? You have a
.
 
place to stay always in my place, a room to yourself, etc.
 
Just let me know so that I can sweep off the screens and
 
change the sheets. The cicadas are haunting tonight, with an
 
almost full moon and lightening on the seaside horizon. A
 
dog barks at nothing but the d
iffer ent l
ights down in the
 
village.
 
Be well.

THE WESTERNIZATION OF TIME & SAMOAN FOLK ARTS
 
The Samoan Islands, politically separated as they are
 
between the independent nation of Western Samoa and the U.S
.
 
Territory of American Samoa, offer a particularly valuable
 
opportunity to observe the effects of disparate economic and
 
societal influences upon the evolving traditional practices
 
of a homogeneous cultural base. Over the past quarter
 
century the forces of modernization have enjoyed a far
 
greater influence in American Samoa than they have in
 
Western Samoa. The results of this amplified continental
 
influence are evident in a comparison of the current
 
practices of traditional material art forms in American
 
Samoa and Western Samoa--particularly the arts of pandanus
 
fiber-plaiting and mulberry bark cloth (ia o) manufacture
 
and decoration.
 
While many factors are at play in this accelerated
 
erosion of vernacular craft practices in American Samoa--
economic and electronic, expectational and self-
definitional--one of the more potent agents is the increased
 
westernization of time in American Samoa as compared to
 
Western Samoa. This subtle paradigmatic shift in the
 
autochthonous woridview of American Samoans has had a
 
practical impact upon these two forms of traditionally
 
female arteraft. While the folk aesthetic,  i
nherited skills,
 
and raw materials to produce these still highly valued
 
indigenous products continue to exist, the time-intensive
 
aspects of the process of their manufacture have come under
 
abnormal stress with the westernization of time.
 
Through the identification and tracking of this
 
singular impediment to the continuation of these traditional
 
art forms,  strategies can be devised to attenuate its
 
impact.
 
At the outset I would like to make clear that the
 
analyses and conclusions drawn in this paper are based
 
entirely upon my observations while working as a public
 
sector folklorist in Samoa. As a "public sector folklorist"
 
(
I hate that self-descriptive phrase), as a folklorist in
 
the service of the folk,  I see my job as not only to
 
observe, document, catalog, analyze, and comment upon
 
aspects of vernacular Samoan culture and art, but also to
 
identify specific areas of stress upon indigenous art forms
 
and artisans and to suggest ways in which intrusive causes
 
of stress may be skirted or cushioned in order to assist
 
native craf.tfolk in the perpetuation and gradual evolution
 
of their art forms.
 
What do I mean by that aspect of continental cultural
 
impact that I am referring to as the westernization of time?
 
In one sense it is obvious. The Samoan word for clock is
 
uati, a cognate for watch. Although there are many different
 
context-specific Samoan words for time, clock time (numbered
 
time) is tainii. These concepts are expressed as cognates of
 
English words because there were no words for, ergo no
 
concepts of,  such values before continental contact. No
 
weekdays; no weekends. No 9 to 5
.
 
In another sense,  though, the westernization of time is
 
more subtle and,  I believe, constitutes what Kuhn (1962)
 
defines as a paradigmatic shift in the woridview of those
 
Samoans exposed to and influenced by a continuous contextual
 
immersion in the conceptual world of western time
 
consciousness.  It can make a big difference when one
 
switches from thinking in terms of "weather days" to "week
 
days",  from the "right time" for doing things to "available
 
time" for doing things.
 
In my experience,  the impact of this paradigmatic shift
 
has been considerably more pronounced recently on Tutuila,
 
the main island of American Samoa, than it has been on the
 
islands of Western Samoa.  I remember when I first arrived on
 
Tutuila in 1976 as a typically right-time-conscious
 
American, being amused by the temporal vagaries of the noon
 
whistles at the tuna canneries on Fago Fago Bay, which
 
whistles wandered daily as much as twenty minutes to and fro
 
from what I deduced to be the "proper"  lunch hour times.
 
That does not happen today.
 
Although most Samoans still retain a highly
 
individual/social sense of personal time,  for many whose
 
lives are now organized along continental time lines into
 
seven-day weeks,  five-day work weeks, eight a
.m.  to four
 
p
.m. work days, bus times, school schedules for children,
 
and extra-cultural calendar events,  their real time has been
 
drastically altered from what it was a generation ago. For
 
those thus effected by this necessary lifestyle shift there
 
has also been a concurrent diminution of seasonal and
 
climactic temporal consciousness. There has been a drastic
 
decline,  for instance,  in the use of tapu, the traditional
 
method of resource management which recognizes that
 
ecological and social considerations dictate the proper time
 
for certain harvesting activities.
 
The two genres of traditional Samoan material art which
 
I have chosen as my core examples--pandanus mat plaiting and
 
siapo production---were chosen because the stress brought
 
upon their manufacture by the westernization of time is more
 
obvious than it is for other varieties of Samoan expressive
 
culture. However, examples could also be drawn from
 
tattooing and wood carving as well as from some forms of
 
traditional performance arts, which, as Sinavaiana (1989)
 
has shown, persist primarily in the nonurban areas of
 
Western Samoa.
 
Both pandanus mat plaiting and Oiapo bark cloth
 
construction are time-intensive activities. Cultivation and
 
preparation of the ingredient plant materials are necessary
 
skills equal at least to the ancillary skills of fiber
 
manipulation and decoration.
 
In the ease of pandanus mat plaiting, proper stands of
 
pandanus must be maintained on land which is also suitable
 
for the cultivation of more immediately marketable (i.e.,
 
male) cash crops such as bananas. When the serrated-edged
 
pandanus leaves are harvested,  they must be correctly cut,
 
trimmed, dried, cooked, peeled, soaked in the sea for a
 
fortnight, redried in the sun, split, scraped, and readied
 
for plaiting. The entire process can take more than a month
 
(Buck 1930:  275-77).
 
While the plaiting is usually done in communal groups
 
of women, the cultivation and preparation of the 1aufa1k or
 
laui'e is ordinarily more an individual or family activity.
 
In Western Samoa and--more rarely today--in rural villages
 
of American Samoa one still sees the front yards of family
 
fales filled with strips of pandanus drying in the sun.
 
The preparations of 5iaoo from the inner bark, or bast,
 
of the paper mulberry (u'a) tree and of the dyes for its
 
decoration are activities requiring a similar investment of
 
attention over a period of time. Like the pandanus,  the i
'a
  
plant requires periodic pruning and tending to insure the
 
suitable growth of saplings for bark cloth manufacture. The
 
complex process of stripping, peeling, scraping, rasping,
 
smoothing,. drying, bundling, beating, stretching, redrying,
 
patching, and joining which follows the harvest of the
 'a
  
saplings and preceeds the process of decorating the ziaDo
  
with natural dyes is time dictated, as different steps of
 
the process must take place while the bast material is at
 
proper degrees of natural moistness or dryness (Buck 1930:
 
283-294).
 
In the traditional Samoan timeframe the details of
 
these processes transpired within the context of a Samoan
 
woman's village and family life. The season,  the weather,
 
the flux and pull of other domestic,  social, and
 
provisionary obligations obviously influenced the actual
 
timing of events, but the processes once begun could proceed
 
as the needs of the materials being processed dictated.  In a
 
sense,  the process ruled time. The timimg of other events
 
could be altered so that the laui'e or u
'& would not be
 
spoilt.  In cases of emergency there was always the large
 
extended family,  the aiRa, to call upon for assistance. When
 
the weather turned, there were children to bring in the sun-
drying pandanus or to quickly wrap up all the half-prepared
 
mulberry bast in old barkeloth or to fetch the rolls of sea-
submersed laui'e tied to rocks out on the reef. There were
 
hands about to help.
 
The children were not at school, nor the men at work
 
away from home. The women were not teaching or shopping in
 
town or cleaning fish at the canneries,  listening to a
 
squall passing through and wondering if someone at home in
 
the village was doing what they were not there to do.
 
Western time.
 
If the process is broken by absences dictated by the
 
obligations of another time context,  the process will tend
 
to cease.
 
My original understanding about the decline of 5iapo
  
production in Tutuila was that there was no
 'a available.
 
Local 5iapo artists purchased finished sheets of bark cloth
 
from Western Samoan sources when it was available. But then
 
the export market of Western Samoan bark cloth became
 
dominated by high-paying German fine-paper firms. Similarly
 
made Tongan ta a available was generally rejected by Samoan
 
artisans as not of fine enough quality.
 
Inspite of this lack of local material there was still
 
interest in siapo decoration within the community. A few
 
older women were still familiar with the entire cloth and
 
dyes manufacturing processes, and younger women (and men)
 
were interested in learning from them. There was still a
 
folk aesthetic that appreciated siapo of good manufacture
 
and design, and families still treasured fine heirloom
 
pieces. There had even been a striking recent evolution in
 
the execution of 2iapo decoration, based upon a freer, more
 
individually interpretive use of traditional motific
 
elements. But there was little or no bark cloth upon which
 
to work.  In our arts instruction programs we had begun
 
substituting unbleached muslin for
 
Then I discovered that some farmers on the island
 
consdidered the paper mulberry plant a weed and were hacking
 
back thickets of it that invaded the margins of their
 
forest-cleared plantations. As I investigated further,  it
 
slowly dawned upon me that the reason local production of
 
mulberry bark cloth had virtually disappeared on Tutuila was
 
not that the u
'a plant had disappeared but that few women on
 
the island any longer had the type of time available to them
 
that was needed for them to see its manufacture successfully
 
through to completion.
 
For the same reason, most of the laufala and laui'e
  
used in mat plaiting was being imported from Western Samoa.
 
And similar levels of interest,  skill, and folk aesthtics
 
applied to mat plaiting as well, with the  ie toga, or fine
 
mat,  still the most highly valued item of traditional gift
 
exchange.
 
After consultations with craftspeople and other Samoans
 
familiar with the situation, a number of strategies were
 
devised to assist native artisans in dealing with this
 
stress introduced by the time bind. Obviously, the usual on-
going activities of a folk arts program--fostering the
 
recognition of folk arts and artists through fairs, shows,
 
workshops, artists in the schools,  etc.---though still
 
important avenues of empowerment, would not resolve the
 
problem.  Somehow the vernacular time envelope had to be
 
nurtured.
 
Through a grant from the Folk Arts Program at the
 
National Endowment for the Arts a Samoan Master/
 
Apprenticeship program has been initiated. Master crafts-
people are paid to pass on their skills to apprentices of
 
their choice. The time frame is determined by the craft
 
being taught. One condition for receipt of local subgrants
 
in this program is that the entire craft practice--from
 
cultivation and preparation of ingredient materials through
 
to production of the final art object--be demonstrated.
 
Another strategy has been to offer practical assistance
 
and encouragement to artisans in the outer islands of the
 
Territory of
 
time has not
 
of our pilot
 
American Samoa, where the impact of western
 
been as intrusive as on Tutuila. The majority
 
Master/Apprenticeship partnerships, for
 
instance,  have been sited upon the smaller outer islands.
 
Also,  an u
' 
cultivation and production project has been
 
initiated on our tiniest and most remote inhabited atoll,
 
Swains Island, where the paper mulberry plant has never been
 
grown before. As encouragement for their efforts,
 
craftspeople have been assured a market for whatever
 
products they produce in excess of their own communal needs.
 
All this is possible because Samoan traditional culture
 
is still vital, displaying the resilience and adaptivity of
 
a majority autochthonous people at home at and at peace with
 
their past and who they are. When one spends real time with
 
Samoans in any of their islands--Western Samoa or American
 
Samoa--one learns that at heart it is the process of life,
 
not its products,  that truly matters. And so should it
 
continue to be with their arts as well.

Had we s

Prepared for the Heritage Interpretation International
 
Third Global Congress, November 3-8,  1991, Honolulu, Hawaii
 
The  ala a: Samoan Traditions of Hospitality
 
The concept of hospitaljty ks not some Platonic given.
 
Insofar as it is universal,  it i
 
i 
s culturally and regionally
 
defined and understood.  It is important to keep in mind the
 
raot that these dirrerenoes exi t as we talk about
 
"tourism." To that end I would ]
1ike to look briefly at
 
Polynesian, specifically Samoanj'traditjons of hospitality.
 
It should not, perhaps, be surprising that the
 
traditional oral narratives of the people we call
 
Polynesians are filled with sto ies and proverbs about
 
travel. The Polynesians are, after all,  the people who
 
colonized and voyaged over the largest,  last,  and most land-
vacuous livable area of our globe--the Pacific Ocean. To do
 
so they developed the greatest human nautical and
 
navigational skills of their epoch. They also evolved a vast
 
cultural web of customs and legends that supported, made
 
sense of,  and carried forward their shared sense of that
 
achievement. Traditional Polynesian heroes and heroines are
 
primarily travelers--Tinilau, Maui, Pele, Nafanua, Lata,
 
Sina. Most of the seminal stories have journeys in them.
 
An inevitable part of goin  on a journey is arriving
 
somewhere,  and the oral narratives of Polynesia also present
 
a code of conduct about how travelers are to be treated by
 
their hosts. These customs of hospitality are so much an
 
assumed part of t
lie woridview of the traditional narratives
 
that any exception from the customary--any show of
 
1
 
2
 
hostility, coldness,  lack of respect--immediately becomes a
 
pivotal point in the story. All visitors--other than war
 
parties--are to be treated with deference and generosity;
 
they are to be feted and fed and honored. To do otherwise is
 
the gravest insult.
 
Given the great distances and perilous nature of travel
 
in the old South Pacific,  this should al o not be
 
surprising. At some level human riature truly and naturally
 
does follow the injunction of do unto others as you would
 
have them do unto you. These customs of reciprocal
 
hospitality became an essential part of Polynesian culture.
 
For the past decade I have been the thankful recipient
 
of the benefits of those customs of hospitality
, in the
 
islands of Samoa. For, although times have changed and
 
methods of travel and the nature of visitors have changed
 
with the times,  traditional values linger on;  and the
 
customary treatment of a j
ualaga--as a travelling party is
 
called in Samoa--is little changed from the time of the
 
legends. As a working folklorist in Samoa I am often "out in
 
the field'--as they say in my field, meaning not in the
 
office--and on countless occasi ons I have been honored by
 
the warmth of a Samoan host's welcome. The essence of this
 
mala a tradition persists throughout Polynesia, but allow me
 
to stick to the culture I know best and draw upon Samoa for
 
my primary examples.
 
Let me give you a quickie version of a Samoan tale
 
about the hero Tigilau, which,  on the surface,  is entirely
 
3
 
about the customs of hospitality. As neighboring
 
archipelagos, Tonga and Samoa have
, a long tradition of
 
conflict and conciliation. Ther  has always been a
 
considerable amount of communication between them. Tongan
 
chiefs,  in fact,  often came on Malaoa to Samoa in search of
 
chiefly brides. Perhaps that was the Tongan chief Ae s
 
unsuccessful original intention when he wade the trip this
 
legend speaks of:
 
After visiting with the Samoan Chief Tigilau as
 
honored guest for many days,
 the Tongan chief Ae
 
asked his host if he could provide him with trans-
portation home, as his boat had been sailed back and
 
he feared it would not be returned for a long time.
 
Against his better judgement Tigilau lent Ae his
 
two pet riding turtles that he dearly loved. Ae
 
promised to treat them well and send them back
 
immediately.
 
The turtles were fast swimmers and Ae alternated
 
between them for the two-day journey to Nukualofa.
 
But, upon landing he ordered the young men on the
 
beach to  '
pull those turtles of the Samoan
 ig out of
 
the water and kill them." One escaped,. but the other
 
was cooked and eaten.
 
The remaining turtle swam back to Samoa. Enraged,
 
Tigilau sent his demons to get Ae. They reached Tonga
 
when he was asleep and they brought him without
 
awakening to Tigilau s house. At dawn Ae awoke to see
 
Tigilau squatting nearby.
 
Startled,  he mumbled,  "I am sitting here.  I am
 
(This has become a proverb meaning,  "
I have done wrong.
 
Please forgive me.")
 
The implacable Tigilau ordered Ae bound hand and
 
foot and laid on the grounc  to roast in the sun until
 
evening when he was set aflame with torches of dry
 
coconut leaves, which burn 'slowly with intense heat.
 
Ae died in great agony and Tigilau sat by him enjoying
 
every minute of it (Fitisemanu n
.d.).
 
The magic turtles,  of course,  as emissaries of Tigilau. 
and guests in Tonga, were due far more respectful treatment.
 
The covenant broken, Ae fried.
 
4
 
Early visitors, primarily missionaries, described and
 
commented upon the ralaga customs. John Williams, for
 
instance,  the first caucasian Christian missionary to visit
 
Samoa, observed:
 
A custom prevails much amongst them which gives a
 
degree of life & variety to the otherwise monotonous
 
routine of domestic life as it exists among the
 
Samoans. Chiefs with many people of their tribe are
 
continually journeying about 0n visits to their
 
different relations. .  .  . [T]hey gener lly contrive to
 
give their friends notice of their intended visit
 
two or three months before they actually arrive in
 
order that their friends may have time to prepare
 
[
tapa] cloth and [fine] mats for them. .  .  .
The stay of
 
the malagna [sic.]  is six eight seldom more than
 
ten days during the whole of which time they are
 
regularly supplied with food by the Chief & people of
 
the settlement. .  .  .
The i
nalagna system appears of great
 
importance in the political economy of the Samoa
 
Islands (Williams 1984).
 
Williams also speculated upon the economic and social
 
aspects of these mass visitations, observing that they were
 
means for the visiting chief to obtain gifts of iapa and
 
fine mats, which were the traditional items of economic
 
exchange in the islands. He also mentions that a nalag 's 
visit was the occasion for the performance of various games
 
--"such as racing wrestling clubbing spearing sham fighting
 
dancing." Of this last "game" he adds,  "The obscene dances
 
are also generally danced when malagnas are present"
 
(Williams 1984).
 
This same basic pattern continues to the present day.
 
However,  the economic purpose has become, usually, a fund-
raising tour for a church or school group;  and the po ula,
 
or night dancing that Williams thought "obscene," was
 
quickly and consistently opposed by the missionaries.
 
5
 
A century later, Margaret Mead supplied observations
 
about the function of Malag& in the Sanojc l
lanu'a Islands.
 
Although the reason for a malaga may be utilitarian--for
 
instance,  to acquire a needed commodity such as sugar cane
 
thatch--the event itself, no matter how small the visiting
 
party, was always an occasion of ceremony and flirtation.
 
Mates from other villages are gen&rally desired in Samoa,
 
and a malai
za was an opportunity for a girl to make her debut
 
and for young men to court. Mead also notes that,  "
In the
 
midnight conviviality of a walaga the dance often becomes
 
flagrantly obscene and definitely provocative in character"
 
(Mead 1928).
 
A century had passed since the missionaries had
 
outlawed the po ula. In fact,  in 1903--a quarter of a
 
century before Mead's visit--the newly self-declared
 
colonial administrations of Samoa, German and American,  had
 
made  ma1ag& themselves illegal unless licensed by the
 
colonial powers (Gray 1960).
 
We could take that date--1903--as an emblematic
 
beginning of the confusion between Zala
 (or native
 
visiting parties) and tourists (or temporary visitors from
 
outside the culture). Here were two "tourists"--Governor
 
Soif of German Western Samoa and Naval Commandant Underwood
 
of American eastern Samoa--officially discouraging Samoan
 
visiting parties. Sixty years later, when Western Samoa
 
finally won its erancipation from colonial powers,  its early
 
independent administrations followed a more or less standard
 
6
 
unwritten policy that while visitors and inter-village
 
visiting parties would not be discouraged,  tourism--as an
 
industry--would not be encouraged. To this day the tourism
 
industry has had little impact upon either Western Samoa or
 
American Samoa. On Malaga field trips to villages on
 
Savai'i,  Samoa's largest and most traditional island,  I have
 
heard my chiefly hosts inveigh at length '
against the evils
 
of tourism,  even as I
, as a visitor, was being waited upon
 
hand and foot and lovingly by their extended families
 
So,  here is a culture with a long tradition of
 
hospitality for whom the visitor industry has been an
 
univiting alternative. What is going on? Where do we not
 
understand each other?
 
There are two very different things going on here,  two
 
very different sets of purposes,  intents,  and outcomes.  In
 
•
Z system--the  ala
--hosts prepare for and accept an
 
A
 
immediate economic loss as the result of a visitation.  In
 
the other system--tourism--the visitation is a source of
 
economic gain for the hosts  In both cases something
 
meaningful is exchanged--or else it wouldn 't happen--but in
 
both cases what is exchanged is differently understood.
 
Ala (peaceful) social exchanges occur because of a
 
reciprocity on one level or another:  I give you this, you..
 
give me that. But when there is such a disparity as exists
 
between the culture that creates the palaga, and the culture
 
that creates tourism,  there is bound to be dissonance in the
 
understanding of the term "hospitality."
 
7
 
Mead posited that in Samoa the village is the god.  In
 
Samoa,  the Lala & functions as a •mniature travelling
 
cosmology of the village. The reciprocity of the mala a was
 
one between villages, between village gods,  if you will. Any
 
village could go on a  ala a; any village,  theoretically,
 
could collect upon that privilege. A g
i&1ag& was a sort of
 
pilgrimage executed inside a closed,  reciprocal system of
 
respect.
 
Something quite different is going on in tourism,
 
something that I will not attempt to typify here. However,  I
 
do think it important to keep in mind,  as we discuss
 
"quality tourism" over the next four days,  that tourism has
 
many faces. The same act, visitation,  can have dramatically
 
disparate meanings,  especially when the cultural leap is as
 
large as it is between continental cultures
. and the cultures
 
of Oceania.
 
I must leave you with one of my favorite Samoan
 
proverbs, which, coincidentally,  has to do with visitors,
 
specifically with over-staying visitors:
 
L
J
a afu le laufala: The floor mats are sweating.
 
Or the approximate equivalent of the phrase where I come
 
from,  "Here's your hat, what's your hurry.'
 
Fa'afetai. Soifua..

Saipan
  
by John Enright
 
Even when new,  unpainted cement looks old.  Bare cement
 
and cement block walls and buildings  shape first impressions
 
of Saipan.  What is called the bush or the jungle elsewhere
 
in Oceania is called the boonies here,  and the boonies along
 
the road from the airport to Garapan seein especially well
 
scattered with bare cement structures in various stages of
 
construction and deconstruction.
 
The boonies are well named. Open spaces here are not
 
filled with tropical jungle or plantations but with an
 
impenetrable, undistinguished low scrub of tangan-tangan and
 
mile-a-minute vines. On distant hillsides sometimes there
 
are glimpses of coconut palms and taller trees
;.
 
Wails of unpainted cement block and expanses of flat
 
cement ioofs with rusted rebar fringe for decoration make up
 
the view from my motel window.  The flat cement roof of the
 
neighboring building--gray even in the acetylene sun
 
-
--is a few feet away from the lip of  my second-floor room's
 
cement balcony. What windows there aro in this view are
 
small or have air conditioners stuck in them.
 
Insight:  I am not enjoying Garapan.
 
Along the beach is a string of resort hotels,  the seeds
 
of Garapan's Waikiki
. future. The shallow blocks behind the
 
backs of these Japanese honeymoon havens,  where my humble
 
motel squats,  are packed with a jumble of over-priced
 
Japanese shops,  karaoke clubs,  restaurants,  stands selling
 
gold by the inch,  and more cement-block buildings under
 
construction filling i
n the remaining street-front gaps.
 
Nan yo the Japanese called these Micronesian islands
 
when they seized them from the Germans in 1914.  Nan yo---the
 
South Seas. The islands are American now,  have been for 45
 
Years,  but on the hot and bumpy streets of Garapan it is
 
hard to tell--except that everything is priced in dollars,
 
dollars rounded off to the highest convenient round number.
 
The streets have the unnatural feeling of an occupied
 
zone.
 
Saipan is the principal island of the Northern
 
Marianas,  14 degrees north of the equator and 2000 km east
 
of Japan.  It's population is around 18,000. The original
 
inhabitants of the island were Chainorro,  aMalayo-Polynesian
 
people,  who first arrived on the island at least 3500 years
 
ago.
 
The first European  invasion of these islands began in
 
the 1660s,  led by Spanish Jesuits. Thirty years later the
 
few remaining Saipan natives were forceably removed from the
 
island to Guam,  the Spanish base of Christian operations.
 
Their subsequent history is not much more cheerful.  In 1899,
 
when Germany purchased the Northern Marianas from Spain,
 
only about 1300 Chamorros lived in all seven of the islands
 
including Saipan. They had been joined by 700 natives of the
 
neighboring Caroline Islands.  But these repatriated
 
Chainorros had been rather thoroughly Catholicized and
 
Ibernianized i
n their 200-year sojourn in Guam.
 
Fifteen years of German exploitation of the island was
 
followed by thirty years of Japanese subjugation.  By the
 
late 1930s there were over 42,000 Japanese nationals in the
 
Marianas.  The 4000 Chatnorros and Carolinians in the islands
 
had become an insignificant minority,  second-class citizens
 
who were expected to adapt to the ways of the new empire.
 
I
 
The new empire. On an excursion along the western coast
 
from carapan to visit the war memorials and "Bonzai Cliffs
 
at the northern tip 01  the island,  the towers of yet another
 
multimillion-dollar 0z-like resort development rise from the
 
dry scrub on the seaside of the road. The road is pot-holed
.,
 
poorly i
naint-l
ined,  torn-up by heavy equipment. Across the
 
road from this newest xanadu is alow hillside community of
 
neat geometric suhurb n splitlevel hous;s,  where th
 
Japane:e staff of this Japanese resort reside.
 
On June 13,  1944,  eighteen U
.S. battleships and
 
destroyers fired more than 15,000 rounds of sixteen inch and
 
five-inch shells onto this west coast of Saipan, preparing
 
it for the first wave of Marines who landed two days later.
 
It took the U
.S.  forces almost two months to secure the
 
island after one of the fiercest battles of the Pacific
 
campaign.  As Lhe  Japanese resistance crumbled,  thousands of
 
civilians,  fearful of American reprisals, jumped to their
 
deaths from the high cliffs at the northern e
nd of the
 
island.
 
Today in Saipan I feel like I am visiting a place that
 
is stil.
1  a battlefield. Although the  lines are more subtly
 
drawn and the weapons are far more sophisticated than tanks
 
and sixteen-inch shells,  the battle for Saipan continues.
 
And again it is the native people of the' island who are
 
caught in the war zone  Visitor opulence and collapsing
 
infrastructures. The mammon of foreign investment and the
 
temptation to sell it all. A proud people hired out as
 
servants.
 
Chamorro clerks speak in Japanese and English. The only
 
magazines for sale at the newstands are Penthouse and
 
Playboy.  At the airport Duty Free shop as I leave,  a bottle
 
of Hennesy is on sale for $490.
 - 
The story of Saipan is a sad one  Perhaps it sh ould be
 
read as a cautionary tale.

In an almost full moon
 
John Enright
 
Around eleven o
'clock tonight a man went crazy down i
n
 
the village. Probably drunk, but his screams and hollare--
whioh I could hear all the way up here--were much more than
 
drunk. He was t
rying to call down the known cosmos onto his
 
head. The dogs i
n the village barked so l
oud at him that
 
they set off the dogs i
n the next village in the next cove
 
down the coast.
 
Several pairs of young men dressed only i
n their night -
time lave
,lavas strolled, arms crossed, down toward the
 
village from the houses across the stream and the plantation
 
above. A couple of times over the y
ears I have been in those
 
parties myself--the men oonverging on one of their brothers
 
i
n trouble. Usually he must be violently subdued. That i
s
 
the only solution he knows to cry out for--combat with his
 
brothers, something that real and painful. Crying out for
 
the only powers--physical powers--that by overpowering him
 
can force him back i
nto his proper place--the muscles to
 
reset the separated joints of his for whatever reason
 
damaged psyche.
 
This time I watched and listened from the porch,  i
n my
 
bedtime lavalava, a drink in my hand, smoking a oigarstte
 
mostly l
istening because although a few l
ights have gone on
 
and the moon i
s high, the village is dark beneath i
t. trees.
 
The pairs of young men converging on this acting-out
 
reassures me. Soon the self-torturing one will be surrounded
 
by male friends and family to subdue his devils. That is
 
what he is calling out for. The cross-armed men chatting and
 
strolling down toward him know this, are calm i
n their
 
acceptance of his screamed obligation, the reciprocity of
 
their role. It i
n ages old. I will k
now him i
n the village
 
tomorrow by his battered, humbled, thankful f
e
.oa. I
'm not
 
here to explain i
t, just describe i
t.
 
And then, just now, as I was writing this, a gun shot
 
rang out in the village, the sound bouncing once off the
 
narrow valley's facing ridges, setting off the fruit bats.
 
And his caterwauling stopped, replaced by female scream' and
 
other stern male voices giving orders. Something arohe
.iQ has
 
gone terribly wrong. The dogs stop barking.
