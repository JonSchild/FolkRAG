AMERICA'S SER1O-COMIC VOCALIST, 
JERRIE AWE& 
• 
This lady, who is undoubtedly one of the most popular vo-
calists in America, was born in the city of New York, where 
she first appeared as a 
vocalist and at once became a 
favorite; 
possessing a 
sweet soprano voice peculiarly adapted for the 
rendition of plaintive ballads. 
Her singing of " Katy Avour-
neen" and " The Pretty Girl Milking her Cow " are still re-
membered with pleasure. 
Miss Engel also introduced for the 
first time in this city Will. S. Haye's " Nora O'Neil," an Irish 
ballad whieh at once sprang into favor; " The Dear Little 
Shamrock" was also sung by her at the same time, and her 
name and fame as a 
vocalist became a 
household topic. 
She 
travelled an entire Season with the Original Hibernicon of 
Ireland, and received the highest encomiums from the Press of 
Canada. 
For three Seasons she sang and acted for the celebrated firm 
of Spalding and Bidwell, undoubtedly:the most prominent and 
yesponsible theatrical managers in the Vnited States, 
No To-

enlist before or ever since created such a 
genuine furore in the 
city of New Orleans, lisr benefits being perfect ovations. 
At 
the Howard Atlimnum, Boston, Miss Engel sang for one year, 
and of all singers, is to-day the greatest card in Boston,— her 
genuine and legitimate receptions testify to the fact. 
For two 
consecutive Seasons she has been one of the principal features 
of the Tony Pastor Combination. 
In the city of Chicago her 
favoritism and popularity are beyond description. 
For eight 
Seasons she has sung at Tony Pastor's Opera House—which 
is a 
sure guarantee of her ability. 
Ever studious and contin-
ually on the alert for new and attractive material, she nn-
doubtedly introduces more new songs for public approval 
than any other vocalist. She has achieved a 
substantial popu-
larity by her untiring efforts and close application, and ranks 
the foremost in her profession; and without the aid of that 
foreign introduction, the paid clacquer.

THAT'S THE WAY THE STORY GOES, 
Sung by Jzzoms ENGEL. 
THERE was a 
Young Woman her name was Fan, that's the 
way the story goes, 
She fell in love with a 
man named Dan, that's the way the 
story goes, 
1C"Ow Dan loved Fan and Fan loved Dan, as true as a woman 
loves a 
man, 
And Dan he owned a 
Potato eau,—that's the way the story 
goes. 
"Yid like to get married," says Dan to Fan, that's the way 
the story goes, 
Say's Fan, " I 
quite approve of the plan, "—that's the way 
the story goes, 
Dan said, " go get your parents' consent," Fan said " she 
would," and away she went 
Looking so fair and innocent,—that's the way the story goes, 
As Fan was going down Nassau Street, that's the way the 
story goes ; 
Another Young Man she chanced to meet, that's the way the 
story goes; 
He looked so shy and winked his eye, to escape his glances 
Fan did try, 
'Twas all in vain, he gave her a 
Pie,—that's the way the 
story goes, 
6 
The Pie it gained the heart of Fan, that's the way the story 
goes, 
The Rival of Dan was a 
Penny Pieman, that's the way the 
story goes, 
Fan gained her Father's and Mother's consent to get married 
and off with the Pieman went, 
But since that day she's had cause to repent,—that's the way 
the story goes. 
_3 
For coming away from ChurCh that day, that's the way the 
story goes, 
A 
German Band began to play, that's the way the story goes, 
And frightened a 
horse in front of a 
car, knocked down and 
killed the Boor Pieman. 
And made a 
widow of faithless Fau.—that's the way the story - 
goes, 
Now broken-hearted about the streets, that's the way the' 
story goes, 
Faithless Fan her Dan oft meets, that's the way the stry 
goes; 
He heeds her not but passes her by, "all hot! Two a 
penny,' 
she hears him cry, 
'And" she's sorry she ever took the pie,— that's the way the 
story goes.

The Scamp, or They Can't Hold a 
Candle to Ms 
I 
FLATTER myself I'm a 
rogue, 
And candidly own I'm a 
cad, 
A 
sharp, a 
leg, a 
vagabond, 
And everything else that is bad. 
I 
proved to my parents a 
bane, 
A 
perfeci. young fiend to my nurse, 
And every year I 
continue to live, 
I'm getting from bad to worse. 
CHORUS. 
Oh 
If there was ever a 
scamp, 
I 
flatter myself I 
am he, 
From William the Norman, to Brigham the Mormon, ; 
They can't hold a 
candle to me. 
I 
was leader in mischief at school, 
Though always so humble and meek, 
And when I 
discovered a 
chance of reward, 
I 
was always informer and sneak. 
By the evil example I 
set, 
Other boys into mischief were led, 
But I 
always managed to pocket the spoil, 
And get other boys wholloped instead.

VERSION OF " 
LET HER APPLY TO ME" 
W ords and Music by Gronon W ARE. 
SOME ladies are not happy, 
When a 
husband they have got, 
But wish that they were single, 
And grumble at their lot; 
I 
really should be happy, 
If a 
hus5and I 
could get, 
I 
Must wait a 
little longer, 
And I 
may be happy yet. 
But there, I'll keep my spirits up, 
And sing a 
cheerful song; 
I 
can't tell what may happen, 
Mr. Wright may come along. 
And if he o:dy see's me, 
If we can agree, 
If he only has Ten Million Pounds, 
Let him apply to me.

In fact, if he behaved himself, 
I 
perhaps to him might say, 
George, go and get the Brougham 
And see me to the play. 
And, perhaps, if he was very good, 
I'd let him stay a 
bit; 
While I 
was in the boxes 
'He might go in the pit. 
Now gentlemen, here is a 
chance 
You don't meet every day; 
You've only got to raise the funds, 
I'll throw myself away.

And take me all about,

There, I'll let him keep my mother; 
And my father. too, as well, 
And all our poor relations 
In the house with us could dwelL 
I'd make any fellow happy, 
Only let me have my way, 
To order lots of dresses 
And Lave him the bills to pay. 
Now what could be more jolly, 
For a 
husband all his life, 
To see his cash invested, 
By me, his darling wile.

TAKE IT, BOB. 
Written and composed by AntrucrnLLorn. 
I'M a 
jolly old miller, Bob Bell is my name, 
And in my own village I'm well known to fame; 
I've a 
wifa and a 
daughter, a 
dear little lass, 
I'm fond of them both, and I'm fond of a 
glass. 
Some say I'm too fond, well perhaps that may be. 
I 
try to be steady, and am as you see; 
lint if I 
attempt to refuse a 
drink-a- day. 
I 
fancy the wheel of the mill seems to say,-
CHORUS. 
Take it Bob, take it Bob. take it Bob, take it Bob, 
That's what I 
fancy the mill says to inc. 
Take it Bob, take it Bob, take it Bob, take it Bob, 
Take it Bob, take it, its better than tea. 
I've trie71 very oft a 
tee-totler to be, 
But my mill is quite right, brandy's better than tea; 
And altho' what I 
say, you may all think absurd; 
I 
believe what the mill says is right, ' pon my word, 
I 
called on old Jonas, ' bout some business you know, 
And he sail. Bob, a 
pipe and a ;lass ' fore ye go; 
Now I 
didn't require it, behove what I 
say, 
But Lath(); a 
mile off, I 
could hear the mill say,— 
Take it Bob, cte, 
*Now 1 
dreamt eother night that Bob Bell was no more, 
That he'd died at the age of p'rhaps forty or more; 
And I 
heard people round me say, drinks done its worst, 
But altho' I 
was dead, I 
was dying with thirst. 
A 
bottle of brandy close by I 
could see. 
It was meant for the mourners, it wasn't for me; 
But as on my bed, still and silent I 
lay, 
In the distance, distinctly I 
heard the mill say.— 
Take it Bob, ttc 
I'm only up here for a 
ht of a 
Spree, 
My wife thinks it s 
business between you and me; 
And you know the old saying, that never deceives, 
What the heart doesn't see, why the eye doesn't grieve. 
I 
must toddle at once, so good bye to ye all, 
Next seasen I 
hope I 
shall give ye a 
call; 
Don't ask me to drink when I'm going away, 
Or I'm certain to fancy I 
hear the mill say, 
Take it Bob, &th

PAM 
I'VE SEEN YOU BEFORE,.) 
Bung with the greatest success by FRED. COYNE. Written and coin: 
rosed by T. DODSWORTEL 
I'M one of the jolliest dashing young blades,' 
'Twas ever your lot to observe, 
A 
boisterous, roving, clever Jack-of-
a1I-trades, 
By no means deficient in nerve, 
I've travell'd all over the countey you see, 
So my breath it would not take away, 
If some of you here would recognize me, 
And politely come forward and say. 
CHORUS. - 
I 
think I 
have seen you before, 
I 
fancy I've seen you before, 
Your face seems to be so familiar to me, 
That I 
fancy I've seen you before. 
Thro' life I've been neither too proud nor too nice. 
Though of course that's no business of thine, 
And although the three card trick's considered a 
'
Plea, 
'Twas a 
favorite hoby of mine. 
But last Epsom races while plying my game 
(Which I 
never shall do any more,) 
A 
fellow came up and requested my name, 
For he fancied he'd seen me before. 
(He said) I 
think I 
have, Icc. 
I 
told him that he was a 
stranger to toe, 
But next moment I 
stared with surprise, 
When the fellow quite cooly informed rue that ilea 
ida :404/ilia+ 444 
14 
Was a 
mounted police in disguise; 
Well, he took me in charge, locked me up for the night, 
And next morning I 
had to appear, 
Before the old judge who startled me quite, 
By mumbling these words in my ear. 
I 
fancy I 
have, &c. 
I 
politely informed the old gent he was wrong, 
For I 
ne7er had been there before, 
When he warned me that I 
must not come out too strong,. 
Or he'd certainly punish me more; 
The three card trick game was then proved against me, 
Which I 
stoutly and firmly denied, 
But it made no impression, I 
plainly could see, 
For the magistrate coolly replied. 
CHORUS. 
I've heard that old story before, 
I've heard that old story before, 
The tale seems to be so familiar to me, 
That I 
fancy I've heard it before. 
Well, he gave me three months which my feelings annoyed. 
And in prison three mouths I 
did stay, 
Since which I 
have sworn lawless games to avoid,/ 
For I 
find that they don't always pay, 
So I've turned comic singer, and nightly appear, 
To amuse and obtain an encore, 
Yet folks everywhere, when my voice they do hear, 
Still fancy they've seen me before. 
I 
think I 
have, *0.

Did. You Ever See an Oyster Walk Dpstairs. 
Written by F. GILBER/ 
I 
LOVE a 
very handsome girl with gleaming golden hair, 
My charmer will not marry me, she daily does declare: 
Upon my knees she asks me to, but in a 
knowing way,— 
She slyly shakes her saucy head, and then to me does say— 
CHORUS. 
Did you ever see an oyster walk up stairs? 
Walk up stairs ? walk up stairs? 
Well, when you do, I'll marry you and share your cares, 
But not before you see an oyster walk up stairs. 
I've got a 
nicely furnished house, a 
few pounds in the bank, 
My friends assure me that I 
am good tempered, gay and frank; 
All this I 
tell my darling, but her love I 
cannot gain, 
She shuts her eyes and then replies in this annoying strain— 
Did you ever, &c. 
Fine satins, silks and laces rich, I 
say that she shall wear. 
If willing but to marry me, to buy them all I 
swear; 
To operas and theatres I 
promise she shalt go, 
But still she asks the question, and so slyly wants to know— 
If I 
ever saw, &c. 
To all the oyster shops in town, I 
sadly wend my way, 
To Billingsgate I 
often go, as well as to Herne Bay; 
In hope to find an oyster that will undertake the task, 
But everybody laughs at me when dolefully I 
ask— 
_ 
16 
CHORUS. 
Have you got a 
leetle native that can walk up stairs? 
Walk up-stairs ? 
walk up-stairs ? 
For if you have, she'll marry me and share niy cares, 
But not before you see an oyster walk up stairs. 
This question I 
will make my own, and use it when I 
can, 
No matter what the query is, I'll answer every man ; 
For instance, if my landlord calls, demanding six month's rent 
I'll say, "Old boy, you'll get it, if you witness the event."— 
CHORUS. 
The day an artful oyster walks up stairs 
Walks up stairs ? 
walks up stairs ? 
For when you do, I'll pay it you, and ease your cares, 
But not before you see an oyster walk up stairs.

THE LITTLE HIBERNIAN HARP. 
Written and composed by Sex. BAGNALL. Sung by JENNIE ENGEL. 
ALI! well I 
remember, one frosty December 
The winds whistled cold and the snow it fell sharp, 
I 
saw a 
young maiden whose arms were quite laden, 
She carried a 
little Hibernian harp; 
She stopped near the door of a 
mansion so stately, 
The lights from the windows shone full in her face. 
I 
thought it my duty to watch that young beauty 
Whose foot pressed the snow with such delicate grace. 
CHORUS. 
The wind whistled keenly, but she sang serenely, 
And tinkled her little Hibernian harp, 
The wind whistled keenly, but she sang serenely, 
And tinkled her little Hibernian harp, 
Bright jewels were shining, ' mid tresses entwining 
On heads of fair beauties, all blushes and sigh, 
But they saw not the beautiful jewels that sparkled 
And fell from the lids of this poor maiden's eyes 
asks over the harp strings her fingers were straying 
The notes on the night wind came plaintive and slow 
The pale lamp of heaven shone forth on the maiden 
Who stood like a 
statue transfixed to the snow. 
And the wind, ezci, 
18; 
I 
spoke to this maiden, whose heart was so laden, 
Who stood so forlorn in the streets for a 
while, 
Her sobs wrung my heart as she answer'd me sadly, 
And said I 
am far from the Emerald Isle : 
My parents are dead, and I 
wander dejected, 
In search of a 
boy that I 
love and adore; 
He's long since departed from me broken-hearted, 
And I 
am alone far from Erin's green shore. 
The wind whistled, &c. 
Need I 
say, I 
saw her, with bright hopes before her, 
Embark in a 
vessel for Erin's green shore, 
I 
watched her on deck till the evening's dark shadows 
Shut out from my sight, and I 
saw her no more; 
On a 
cold winter's night as I 
sit by the fire. 
And mournful winds whisper that snow's falling sharp, 
I 
think of the desolate, poor Irish maiden 
Who tinkled the little Hibernian harp. 
The wind whistled: &c.

NGEL. 
Written and composed by S
AM. B
AGNALL. 
ONE summer night some time ago, when birds had gone to 
sleep, 
And little stars at heaven's gate came out to wink and peep; 
The lilies and the pretty flowers wafted sweet perfume, 
A 
shepherd's pipe was heard afar, to play this pretty tune. 
Onnus. 
While standing at the gate with Ada, 
While standing at the gate with Ada, 
While standing at the gate with Ada, 
One evening rather late, 
• r 
press'd her hand beneath the tree, the lilac kissed her cheek, 
Her pouting lips were just apart, her sigh wag soft and sweet; 
The odor of her balmy breath was like sweet Indian spice, 
I 
stole a 
sweet enchanting kiss, I 
might have stole it thrice. 
While standing at the gate with Ada, &c. 
A. naughty bee out rather late, that moment by me flew, 
And his style quite plainly told he had been drinking dew; 
So deeming us too near his house, my cheek he quickly stung 
A.nd as he flew into his hive right merrily he sung. 
While standing at the gate with Ada. &c. 
I 
bade my love a 
sweet good night, the hour was growing late, 
She press'd her lips against my cheek, and closed the wicket 
gate ; 
Click, went the latch, the door it creaked, I 
sighed,- good night 
fair maid, 
And to my love my own fond dove, I 
breathed this serenade. 
I'm waiting at the gate for Ada, &c,

THE YOUNG MEN OF THE DAY, 
Sung by JENNIE ENGEL. 
I'M a 
young man of the present day, 
And the fashion has created— 
Many men like me, as you will say, 
Tho' not so bad as stated. 
About the little village I 
can find my way, 
And I'm very seldom seen inebriated, 
Tho' a 
fast young man of the present day, 
Of the present, of the present day. 
CHORUS. 
For I 
am a 
young man of the present day, 
Tho' I'm not so bad as some people say; 
If I 
drink, and I 
smoke, and I 
dance and play, 
I'm not such a 
bad one for all that. 
Now and then at Billiards I've a 
spin, 
In a 
Theatre oft am seen, o' 
At Music-Halls sometimes I 
look in, 
Or else at the Casino. 
A 
little recreation in the dancing way, 
Is enjoyed with a 
zest so very keen o' 
By the fast young men of the present day; 
Of the present, of the present day. 
For I 
am, to. 
I 
find myself in togs and tiles, 
My ties and crabs providin', 
And if I 
have to go two miles— 
A 
handsome cab I 
ride ; 
The cost of washing linen I 
of course defray, 
For a 
nobby-looking shirt, I 
take pride in, 
Like the other young men of the preseut day; 
Of the present, of the present day. 
For I 
am, Sr,c. 
They say that I've a 
wish to roam, 
And that I 
avoid as blisters,— 
My Pa and Ma, also my home, 
My brothers and my sisters. 
To stay out half the night, I 
am inclined, they say, 
That my manners altogether are remiss, sirs, 
Like the other young men of the present day. 
Of the present, of the present day. 
For I 
am, &c. 
Now, as my faults to you I've told, 
Or, of what my friends accuse me; 
To ask a 
favor I 
make bold, 
And know you'll not refuse me, 
Be a 
little lenient to me, I 
pray, 
For what I 
have done was only to amuse ya 
As a 
fast young man of the present day 
Of the present, of the present day. 
For I 
am, &A

ANSWER TO LITTLE BROWN JUG. 
Suny by JENNIE ENGEL. 
MY wife and I 
lived all alone, 
In a 
brown stone house we call'd our own, 
She had money and I 
had none, 
And that is why we were joined in one. 
CHORUS, 
Ha! ha! ha! just bear and grin, 
When you have found you're taken in. 
Ha! ha! ha! just sear and grin, 
When you have found you're taken in. 
I 
thought I 
made a 
point so fine, 
That mine was hers and hers was mine, 
With golden hooks we fish'd for fate, 
And both caught gudgeons with our bait. 
Ha! ha! hat &e. 
Par she supposed that I 
was rich, 
While I 
was on the self-same " hitch," 
The cruel vixen had me pinned 
To one lame leg, and a 
bag of—wind. 
Ha! ha! ha! &c.

THE VILLAGE CLOCK. 
Sung by JENNIE ENGEL. 
THE village clock is striking eight I 
As the misty twilight closes, 
And some one stands in the cottage porch, 
Under the clustering roses; 
And ever she gazes down the road, 
Her young heart anxiously beating; 
" 
Why stays he so late" thinks she, 
Her lips each stroke of the clock repeating 
" 
Why stays he so late" thinks she, 
Her lips each stroke of the clock repeating. 
The village clock is striking ten 
While two 'neath the roses lingar, 
And something bright in the fair moonlight, 
Shines on the maiden's finger; 
And whispers the youth " to morrow morn 
As he bias good-bye in the door way: 
Oh! hasten thy coming, happy dawn, 
There shall some one be waking before ye 
Oh! hasten thy coming, happy dawn, 
There shall some one be waking before ye. 
I'VE heard some people say,—If you only know the way: 
Success is very easy to obtain, 
Of that I've not a 
doubt, the way you first find out 
And then success you certHnly may gain; 
Some men as you're aware, build castles in the air, 
But very soon they vanish and decay, 
Whilst others on firm ground build castles firm and sound 
It's easy, if you only know the way. 
CHORUS. 
My advice now don't forget, and never run in debt, 
One hundred cents in the dollar always pay; 
Then Fortune's sure to smile, and you may live in style, 
it's easy, if. 
you only know the way. 
Some men of honest mind, examples to mankind, 
Who never do a 
fellow creature wrong; 
Because they're not unjust, get lower in the dust 
And vainly struggle in life's busy throng. 
Some men you may remark, like working in the dark, 
And others in the honest light of day, 
But be it dark or light, some gain ambition's height 
It's easy, if you only know the way. 
My advice now, &c, 
26 
-Some bankrupts, when in debt, soon out of trouble get. 
And companies there are too by the score; 
Whose base Directors will their gaping pockets fill 
With savings of the honest, needy poor, 
Then fortune-hunters bold, although they're sometimes sold, 
A winning card will very often play, 
And wed some foolish dame, with money and a 
name, 
It's easy, if you only know the way. 
My advice now, &c, 
Let each one do his best, and luck will do the rest 
As on life's stormy ocean we are tossed, 
Don't borrow from a 
friend, and don't too freely lend 
For through it. friends are very often lost; 
Then try with all your might, to do what's just and right 
And don't let vulgar tastes your judgment sway 
But work with light good wi:1 to climb Dame Fortune's Mil, 
It's easy, if you only know the way. 
My advice now, .&c,

The Blighted Husband, or Poor Married Man. 
Sung by JENNIE ENGEL. 
KIND friends I'm a 
martyr, a 
thing of the past, 
A 
poor faded flower that cannot long last, 
Tho' once I 
was jolly handsome and free, 
But my wife has quite settled me. 
I 
thought when I 
got married to Miss Angelina Green, 
That I 
should be the happiest man the world had ever seen, 
But how to tell, this awful tale my blighted features scan, 
Then let me be a 
warning to each unmarried man. 
SPOKEN—Yes, my happy single friends, look at me—a mar-
ried man. 
You see I'm married, although a 
few months back 
was considered a 
sweet and interesting youth; but now they 
call me the " Caution."— 
CHORUS. 
I 
once was so handsome, rosy and gay, 
But now 1. am settled and faded away, 
In fact I 
was rakeish and called " Giddy Dan,", 
Behold me a 
poor married man. 
No youth could be fairer than I 
used to be, 
The pride and hope of the whole family. 
The image of my mother, the pet of my dad, 
A 
sweet'tempered, round shouldered lad ; 
My youthful hopes all vanished when my 
away, 
I 
thought Miss Green had money, but grieves me now to say, 
She was ugly, lame and squinted, and tall as a 
Giraffe, 
My friends instead of pitying me they only jeer and laugh. 
SPOKEN—Yet she never treated me to a jam tart, or a 
penny 
valentine ; all she thinks about is reading all the high class 
novels, 
Jack Sheppard," " The Road to Ruin," " The New-
gat& Calendar," " Sketches" by Turpiu and Calcraft, and 
other eminent authors; whilst I—poor Bounce she calls me 
"Boggy"—has to do the washing and run errands for the 
lodgers; but mind you, a 
day will come, 'twill be a 
will-come 
day.— 
I

THE ALPHABET OF SWEETHEARTS. 
Sung by JENNIE ENG. Written by CHARLES SANSOM, 
SWEETHEARTS I've had six and twenty, 
All ages, colors and tempers too; 
So to amuse I 
will attempt, and 
Tell what they all contrived to do: 
Miss A. left me for Alfred Ardine, 
Miss B. bolted bellowing like a 
bear, 
Miss C. was cross-eyed, crook'd and cranky; 
Miss D. drove off with Doctor Drear. 
CHORUS. 
Miss E. eloped with Edward Easy, 
Miss F. she fled, where no one can tell, 
Miss G. she grizzled and went to Gravesend, 
Miss H. hopped off with a 
howling swell; 
Miss I. insane became I'm certain, 
Miss J. jilted me for Joiner Jack; 
Miss K. she kissed and got kidnapped, 
Miss L. for a 
lark gave me tile sack. 
SPOKEN.—S0 
you'll see and agree with me that a 
very bad lot

Miss 0. objected to my offer,

Miss R. with a 
Robert to Reading flew; 
Miss S. she slipped away with a

Miss Y. unwisely went to Yorkshire, 
Miss Z. she died in a

Sweet spirit hear my pray'r,

And in such a

That you'll remember me. 
Come where my love lies dreaming, 
Far, far upon the sea; 
I'm a 
young man from the country, 
But yon don't get over me, 
I'm a 
young man from the country, 
But you do not swindle me. 
Come into the garden, Maud, 
Under the old oak tree; 
For no one knows a 
father's love, 
But impudent Barney O'Hea; 
Then nil de,.Terandum, 
never despair 
For the love of Nancy Till, 
But I'll hang my harp on a

A

THE YOUNG OHAP DRESS'D IN BLUE 
Sung by JENNIE ENGEL. 
I'LL tell you a 
tale about Dorothy Vale 
A 
cook in Grosvenor Square, 
Who fell in love with a 
fine young man, 
Who'd about his face much hair. 
His eyes they were of' a 
gooseberry t 
int, 
'Tis as well to tell to you, 
With a 
slight procliTity to a 
squint, 
And he wore a 
suit of blue. 
CHORUS. 
He was a 
fine man, fol de diddle I 
do 
He was a 
fine man tol de riddy eh! 
He was a 
fine man, fol de diddle I 
do, 
He was a 
fine man, fol de diddle day. 
On his collar there was a 
number plac'd, 
On his arm there was a 
band, 
And as he walk'd with a 
stately step, 
No one looked half so grand. 
The little boys with their kites and hoops, 
From him like wild fire flew, 
While cookey would hand up the mutton chops, 
To this young chap dress'd in blue. 
He was a 
fine man, ttc. 
The magistrate committed him, 
The cookey lost her place ; 
But the cabby shorgy married her, 
To kiver her disgrace; 
The poor policeman got six years, 
Penal servitude to do; 
So that's all I 
know of the cabby, the cook, 
And the young chap dress'd in blue, 
Who was a 
fine man, &c.

PLIRTING IN THE TWILIGHT. 
Wordu by MISS JENNIE ENGEL. 
MUSIC 
by DAVID 1311111114 
OH I'm very fond of roving 
When the stars are in the sky; 
And a 
heart so true and loving 
Often meets me on the sly. 
The sweetest words he whispers, 
And his eyes are sparkling blue; 
But what he tells, you may be sure, 
I'll never tell to you. 
Oh! we wander while the shadows fall, 
But a 
pair of eyes are my light; 
Of all the joys it beats them all, 
This flirting in the twilight. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! my heart kept going pit-i-pat, 
I 
scarce could tell what I 
was at; 
We wandered in the shadows, 
But his beaming eyes they were my light. 
Of joys we meet, there's none so sweet 
As flirting in the twilight. 
(Symphony, when dance is omitted.) 
Now he called me " pet " and " dearest." 
And I 
could not tell you half! 
And he said I 
was the " nearest " 
Then I 
laughed a 
little laugh! 
His arm he kindly offered, 
Then he offered me his hand, 
And said, he'd make his darling one 
The happiest in the land! 
Tho' twas darkness in the pleasant air, 
Yet his beaming eyes were my light! 
He kissed me—ere I 
was aware— 
While flirting in the twilight! 
Oh my heart, &e. 
Now I 
never can forget him, 
Nor his dear, enticing way! 
Near the place where I 
have met him 
0, I 
wander every day! 
3Iy heart is in his keeping, 
He has stolen that I 
know, 
He really makes a 
very sweet 
And fascinating beau! 
So we wander in the darkness yet, 
But his charming eyes are my light! 
My heart was caught in Cupid's net 
While flirting in the twilight! 
Oh my heart, &c,

Out of the Frying Pan into the Fire. 
Sung by JENNIE ENGEL. 
PITY my sorrow and melt at my woes, 
What I've put up with you wouldn't suppose, 
How I've been treated and snubb'd all along, 
Listen to me and I'll tell in my song; 
When but a 
schoolboy tho' trying my best, 
In the last form I 
continued to rest, 
Getting well fiogg'd when I 
tried to rise higher, 
'Twas out of the frying pan into the the. 
CHORUS. 
Out of the Frying Pan, out of the Frying Pan, 
P'rhaps you may fall, if too high you aspire, 
Out of the Prying Pan, out of the Frying Pan, 
Out of the Frying Pan into the fire. 
When tired of leading a 
batchelcr's 
Looking around me I 
sought for a 
wife, 
Met with an angel with manners so soft, 
Face like a 
Cherub's that sits up aloft, 
Oh! how I 
pictur'd our lives free from care, 
4 
Happy as dicky birds up in the air, 
But such a 
temper had darling Maria, 
'Twas out of the Frying Pan into the fire. 
Out of the Frying Pan, &a 
Doting on children, to babies endear'd, 
Happy was I 
when the first twins appear'd, 
But the next year they were triplets we had, 
Somehow or other I 
wasn't so glad; 
Now at my table twelve mouths do I 
see 
Hungry and open and waiting for me, 
Why did I 
ever to marriage aspire, 
Twas out of the Frying Pan into the Fire. 
Out of the Frying Pan, ite. 
Once I 
bought shares in a 
line that they made, 
Twenty per cent. was the dividend paid, 
Crash went the bubble, my savings entire, 
Went out of the Frying Pan into the Fire, 
Since then I've found that it's best to stand still, 
Letting the world jog along as it will, 
Fearful to move lest I 
sink in the mire, 
Out of the Frying Pan into the Fire. 
Out of the Frying Pan, Ice.

BILL? WELLER. a 
vocalist, young and ambitious, 
Whose muse was decidedly good and propitious, 
He sigh'd for high honors and tuned his banjo, 
And nightly drew plaudits from the gods at the show, 
The fair sex admired him, he made conquests a 
score, 
The artists too laughed at his puns o'er and o'er, 
But sad his misfortune and bitterest of pills, 
His name wasn't large on the regular bills. 
CHORUS. 
The ballet girls adored him and stood in the wings, 
While he tuned his banjo and said funny things, 
But sad his misfortune and bitterest of pills, 
His name wasn't large on the regular bills. 
His fame kept increasing throughout all the land, 
And scores of new friends he shook by the hand, 
The dailies, too, praised him in articles long, 
For his manipulations of banjo and song, 
Then resolving to be in the profession a 
beau, 
He called on a 
tailor for a 
suit comme il faut, 
But the snip would not trust or measure his limbs, 
For his name wasn't large 011 the regular bills. 
The ballet girls, &c. 
A 
bewitching brunette did his senses entrance, 
His heart was a 
slave to her enraptured glance, 
He proposed, was refused, so to end all his woe, 
Packed his things up at night bade adieu to the show, 
And now o'er the sea in far distant climes, 
He wanriers on foot, plays his banjo and rhymes, 
Foe 
ountry or home his heart never thrills, 
For

THE FACTORY GIRL OF ,KANCHESTER. 
As sung by M ISS JENNIE EIN GEL.

blue print gown, and a 
shawi c•n her arm, 
And a

charming little head, the hair of which was red, 
And smothered all over with cotton.

I 
brought her up to town into Westminister, 
She was highly delighted with the dancing; 
And her pretty little clogs went tap, tap, tap, 
a 
And I 
couldn't keep her still for her prancing 
She said she was single, and would like to wed 
To some one who was a 
famous Comic Singer, 
Then she said to me, I'd like to marry thee, 
If thou'll place the little ring upon my finger; 
I 
ran as quick as thought, and the little gem I 
bought 
And gave it her for ever, as I 
told her; 
But the naughty little Miss, a 
few weeks after this, 
Was married to a 
six-foot soldier. 
I 
brought her, &c. 
What these pretty girls will do to lovers kind and true, 
how they fool them, teaze them, and despise them; 
Until it is too late, and they have joined their fate 
By wedding those who know not how to prize them. 
So you see I've lost the girl, who I 
thought a 
priceless 
It serves me right for being such a 
spooney, 
So young lads beware, of this factory girl take care, 
Or like me you'll become a 
perfect looney.

Courting in the rain, courting in the rain, 
'Twas sweeter far than moon or star, 
Whilst courting Mary Jan' 
The rain poured down alarmingly, 
When to a 
tree we came, 
And shelter took beneath it: 
There I 
quickly learnt her name. 
the also told me where she lived. 
With Pa down at the farm, 
1. farmer's daughter: well, said I, 
That is an extra charm. 
SPOKEN. —I 
glory in country life, and a

what could be better ? I 
wished the rain would keep on as 
rather liked— 
Courting in the rain, &a 
At length the rain abated, 
And the sun shone out quite bright, 
The little birds began to sing, 
My heart it felt so light— 
I 
gently pressed her arm in mine, 
And said: " Now don't say nay, 
But let me come and meet you here 
Again, some other day." 
SPOKEN.—" Well, she said, I 
can't exactly decide, you must 
ask my Pa—" So I 
made up my mind to go in and inform tin 
old L-entleman we'd been 
We reached the old farm-house, and then 
She introduced to me 
Her Pa, a 
jolly nice old ropy, 
With him I 
made quite free: 
I 
told him where and when I'd met, 
ills daughter in the rain, 
And bleitied the lucky chance that took 
Me down that country lane—

kind attention, :Ind I 
soon gained ills consent, which proves the 
truth of the old proverb—" It never rains out it pours," and sv

They seem laughing, Mollie darling, 
While fair Luna hides her light; 
Oh! no one listens but the flowers, 
While they hang their heads in shame, 
They are modest, Mollie darling, 
When they hear me call your name. 
Mollie, fairest, &c.

Though the parting gives me pain; 
When the stars shine, Mollie darling,

Happy may you ever be, 
When you're dreaming, Mollie darling,

MY NATIVE LAND SO GREEN.

CARRY. 
Sung by JOHN FIELDING. 
I 
AM a 
true born Irishman, I 
came from Paddy's land, 
Where the stranger finds a 
welcome with the grasp of 
friendship's hand, 
Where the wit it flows spontaneously, and pleasure' does 
abound, 
And good nature mixed together in abundance can be 
found, 
Where the boys are all so jolly at a 
pattren race or fair, 
For courting pretty girls, none with them can compare, 
They're the bravest set of boys that ever yet were seen, 
The boys of dear ould Ireland, my native land so green. 
You will surely find that Paddy, his aid will always lend, 
And be ready to assist you, if e'er you want a 
friend, 
If his cabin you should enter, you as well as me, 
He'll treat you to the very best, quite welcome you will be, 
He'll share his pipes and whiskey, your spirits he will c 
beer, 
Oh ould Ireland you're my darling, the spot I 
love so dear, 
For true hospitality, no matter where I've been, 
There's no place like ould Irelend, my native land so green. 
If e'er you're bent on pleasure, abroad you need not roam; 
There's no such sights in foreign lands like those we have 
at home, 
Killarney's lakes are beautiful as everyone must own, 
And if you're fond of nonsense, just kiss the Blarney stone. 
We have scenery in Wicklow, there's the Giant's Causeway 
too, 
The bay and sights round Dublin are splendid to the view, 
I 
have travelled many a 
thousand mile, strange countries 
I 
have seen, 
But none to equal Erin's Isle, my native land so green. 
Then here's success to Erin, my own dear native Isle, 
May discontent soon vanish, and plenty on her smile, 
May discord and ill-feeling be banished from thy shore, 
And prosperity shine on thee as it did in days of yore; 
I 
only wish for happiness, that our troubles soon would 
cease, 
So we might live like brothers in unity and peace, 
May trade increase and flourish and shortly will be seen, 
The people gay and happy in my native land so green.

'DOLLY D0'11. 
AB 
sung by MISS JENNIE ENGEL. 
I'M told that once there lived a 
maid, 
Whose name was Dolly Dot, 
And while her Pa soled boots .and shoes, 
She sold potatoes hot; 
He never stirred from out his stall, 
But Dolly had to roam, 
For she repaired to Madison Square 
While be repaired at home. 
CTIORUS. 
Dolly Dot was handsome, Dolly Dot was fair, 
Dolly Dot potatoes hot sold in Madison Square; 
Oh! Dolly Dot was charming, Dolly Dot was gay 
And just the sort of a 
girl to steal a 
fellow's heart away 
Now as she earned her daily bread 
'Tis said that it befel, 
She won the heart of one who came 
Ills daily bead to sell; 
So gay was he that in his coat 
A 
flour was always found, 
And he went round the Square because 
The Square was in his round. 
Dolly Dot, a. 
PUt Dolly hay/ a 
black amour 
A 
chimneg sweep so cute, 
Auld as she helped the black-a-moor, 
She looked upon his soot; 
An ah persuading tongue had he 
And 
as sub an adept, 
That all h. crked was chimneys weep 
I And then tlio chimneys wept. ‘1, 
Dolly Dot, &c. 
These two heroes were bosom friends 
Until it cane about, 
That they fell in with Dolly Dot 
And then they both fell out; 
Beside poor Dolly's can they met 
For her fair hand to fight, 
And soon they had the matter up 
And down in black and white. 
Dolly Dot, &G. 
The baker soon began to tire, 
For duagh is tender stuff, 
And when they'd a 
bout or two 
He'd -
nad about enough; 
The lucky chimney sweep thus proved 
His right to Dolly's charms, 
And soon his sweetheart flew unto 
gqr..i0VV4 victorious arms. 
*Dot, its. 
LET people talk of foreign life 
Its pleasures and its joys, 
But continental gaiety 
To me's all empty noise. 
And rattling, dashing Broadway, too, 
Is quite thrown in the shade, 
By Long Branch in the season there, 
Upon the Grand Parade. 
CHORUS. 
Upon the Grand Parade, 
Upon the Grand Parade, 
The Grand Parade at Long Branch 
Throws our Broadway in the shade. 
Upon the Grand Parade, 
Upon the Grand Parade, 
For such a 
jolly set you'll meet, 
While on that Grid Parade. 
What can be more delightful 
Than a 
charrning morning's wak, 
-With lots of dashing fellows there, 
,Alid lots ot ninny taikz• 
-

And sum pretty little speeches, too; 
Yet I 
sadly am afraid 
There are some naughty fibs all told, 
Upon that Grand Parade, 
Upon the Grand Parade, & c. 
For girls that want a 
husband, 
That's the place to pick and choose, 
There's Dutchman, Frenchmen, Germans, Turks 
Italians, Greeks, and Jews; 
And fine old American gentlemen 
Who have their fortunes made, 
And gay young swells with none at all, 
Upon that Grand Parade. 
Upon the Grand Parade, &e, 
If ever I 
get married, 
Why I 
hope that it will be, 
To some nice, jolly captain, 
Whose been all his life at sea. 
And then I 
shah persuade him to 
Buy his little dear in trade, 
A handsome villa by the sea, 
And near that Grand Parade. 
Upon the Grand Parade, &e.

AFTER ME. 
.tig by Miss JENNIE Ewan. 
I 
AM a 
jovial customer, all miseries I 
shun, 
And as the proverb tells us. I 
take care of number one, 
I'm not at all a 
selfish man, my maxim don't you see, 
Is to let other folks go first, go first? yes, after me. 
CTIORIJS. 
After me, After me, tor greediness don't thirst 
Alter me, Yes, After me and then you shall he first. 
Whilst walking out the other day ' twas somewhere near the 
strand, 
In my coat pocket soon I 
felt a 
rather clumsy hand, 
Some rough was just about to take my handkerchief away, 
But I 
was quick I 
collar'd him, and thus to him did say— 
After me, & c, 
I 
had a 
dance one night last week 'twas at a 
tradesman's ball, 
With such a 
charming partner too, the handsomest of all, 
At my expense she drank Champagne when sonic swell said 
my dear, 
When the ball is done I'll see you home, I 
whisper'd in his ear. 
After Inc. &e. 
I 
know a 
sponging fellow who somehow will not act square, 
And when the ' settling" times come round will never iuy his 
share, 
lie did the usual greedy at a " Wine Party" to day, 
lie seized a 
bottle but I 
snatelid it from him and did say— 
After me, &e. 
a 
TWILIGHT IN TUE PARE, 
Sung by MISS JENNIE ENGEL. 
'TWAS 
on a 
summer's day. 
I 
met her all by chance; 
Her smile was bright and gay, 
And loving was her glance! 
We wandered in the ' mall," 
We 
strolled beside the " lake ;" 
Her pretty hand so white and small 
Of course, I 
chanced to take I 
We talked about the swans 
And all the other birds, 
I 
thought I 
heard sweet music 
When I 
listened to her words! 
She leaned upon my arm ; 
The sun went down the west, 
I 
tried in vain to whisper all 
The love within my breast! 
CHORUS. 
Twilight in the Park! 
Twilight in the Park I 
Cupid lingers there, 
And no one near to mark! 
Some one by your side, 
Happy as a 
lark ! 
That's the time I 
love, 
Twilight in the Park I 
She left me at the gate, 
And sweetly said good bye; 
I 
begged to know my fate, 
And half suppressed a 
sigh-1 
SPEAK OUT LIKE -A 
MAN, 
Sung with the greatest success by ;JENNIE ENGEL. 
THOUGH you gentlemen are smiling, 
It's very plain to me, 
But most of you are single, 
Which of course ought not to be, 
There's girls I'm sire in plenty. 
Who would your happiness advance, 
By wedding you to morrow 
If they only had a 
chance. 
CHORUS. 
Then don't be shy, for single life's a 
sin, 
Fair lady, as the proverb says, 
Paint heart did never win. 
Then don't be shy, but do the best you can. 
And when you go a 
courting, 
Why, speak out like a 
man. 
When at your kind attentions, 
We appear to take offense, 
Pray don't be disconcerted 
That's merely a preence. 
if to wring your ears we threaten 
We, of course, mean no such thing, 
It's merely a 
suggestion, 
We ourselves should like a 
ring. 
Then don't be shy, (1
1-e. 
Now you gentlemen attention, 
If you'd happy be for life, 
Don / live in single wretchedness, 
But quickly take a 
wife. 
There's a 
funny man sitting there, 
Like ore upon the shelf, 
T ) set you an example, 
I'll make love to him myself. 
Then don't be shy, L'ic.

THERE'S BOUND TO BE A 
ROW. 
Sung by Miss JENNIE ENGEL. 
I'M a 
poor unlucky married man, 
I've got an awful wife, 
To please her I 
do all I 
can, 
But still she plagues my life, 
If I 
do everything that's ri?.ht, 
She'll find a 
fault some how. 
And if not in at eight each nigh $ 
There's bound to be a 
row. 
CHORUS. 
There's bound to be a 
row, 
Bound to be a 
row, 
Do all in life to please my wife, 
Yet there's bound to be a 
row. 
She makes me do the household work 
When I 
come home at night, 
If I 
cough or sneeze when going to bed, 
Of course that is not right. 
If she should wake the young ones up, 
With rage she'll storm I 
vow, 
And if I 
snore too hard for her, 
Why there's bound to be a 
row, 
There's bound, Sze. 
55 
She wakes me early eviry 
In an awful cruel way, 
She kicks me round about the room, 
Yet not a 
sentence dare I 
say, 
I 
have to wash my stockings, 
My pants and shirts I 
vow, 
And if I 
don't wash for her as well, 
There's bound to be a 
row. 
There's bound, Icc. 
And when I'm paid my wages, 
After working hard all week, 
I 
give her ev'ry farthing up, 
And then she's got the cheek, 
To give me two pence for myself, 
And for that I 
have to bow, 
But if I 
spend it all at once, 
There's bound to be a 
row. 
There's bound, & o. 
The original Copy of this song was given to Johnny Roach by 
George Harris, the great English Comique. 
I 
sha'n't forget how queer I 
felt when first I 
fell in love, 
I 
had a 
most severe attack through squeezing a 
lady's glove. 
Her lovely hand was in it as I 
danced with her so gay, 
I 
thought myself in paradise—it's funny when you feel that 
way. 
CHORUS. 
I 
felt as tho' I'd tumbled Into honey, and some one had left me 
all their money. 
The feeling's so peculiar and funny, its funny when you feel 
that way. 
I 
took her down to supper, and sat down by her side, 
I 
helped her to the flees, and filled her glass with pride, 
In fact paid such attention, that she viewed me with dismay, 
I 
moved my chair so close to hers, it's funny when you feel that 
way. 
I 
felt as though &c. 
We met again one afternoon, and as we were alone, 
I 
plucked up nerve to ask her if some day she'd be my own ; 
She blushed and said go see papa and ask him if I 
may, 
danced the cancan round the room, it's funny when you fee) 
that way. 
I 
felt as though &Le. 
The old man said that we might wd and so he crowned out 
bliss, 
And I 
shall be a 
married man in about a 
month from this. 
It seems as though the time, somehow, would never pass away 
I 
long to hear those wedding bells, it, s 
funny when you fee.

BEAUTIFUL LOVE, 
As sun,9: by G
EORUEIIARRIS, 
the Engli4i Cori, qdc. 
LOVE love, Oh, what is love, ' tis that makes man feel so pc• 
euliar ; 
Oh, love, who does not love a 
Maud. :a 
Matilda, a 
Jane or a 
Julia ? 
Love it is, and love alone, that makes the world go round aim 
round, 
Love is certain to be known, where a 
woman's to be found. 
When one has the first attack it's like rasperry jam, running 
down o

CHORUS. 
Oh, love, be mini love, love it is that makes a 
man feel so pe-
culiar. 
Oh, love, beautiful love, a 
man's but a 
fool when he falls in 
love. 
Oh love, when you're in love, to presents, to parties and pic-
nics you treat her, 
Oh love, just squeeze her glove, and you feel as though you'd 
like to eat her; 
But the best of loves must part, then an end comes to your 
You press the dear one to your heart and take from her the 
p 
tiling kiss, 
Yon bid her good-bye at the door with another sly kiss and two 
or three more. 
Oh, love, &c. 
Ii 
lie 
Oh love, when you're in love every half hour you'd go to court 
her. 
But Oh, love, if she won' t 
love, you talk about drowning your-
self in cold water ; 
If it's all right she'll giggle and say please ask father if I 
may, 
Then you feel so jolly and gay, and tease her till she names the 
day, 
You'll serenade her when she's abed and her dad drops flower-
pots on your head. 
Oh love, &c. 
Oh love, when you've your love out, all the money you have 
you must ladle, 
Servants, dresses, parties, and balls, perhaps each year a 
cherub 
to lay in the cradle. 
When the honeymoon is past then your eyes are not so blind, 
Your dream was far too good to last and your face grows long 
to find, 
Your looked for happiness begins with a mother-in-law and 
beatiful twins. 
Oh love, &c, 
— 
OH! NICODEMUS. 
My 
lover he's going to sea, Oh! Nicodemus, 
He's going away and leaving me, 
To watch the little fishes, swimming in the sea 
But he'll soon wish for home, and to be back with me, 
The ship will heave to, Nicodemus I 
And so wretched you will be, so wretched you will be., 
CHORUS. 
(Spoken.) So she said— 
Oh, Nicodemus I 
Nicodemus! 
don't you go away ? 
I've loved you Nicodemus and I've loved you many a 
day, 
I've loved you in your plain attire, your lovely fustian coat, 
Don,t leave me Nicodemus, for that boiler-bursting boat. 
(SPoxEN.) And again she began to sing— 
Salt water, you know, is -very wet, Oh, Nicodemus I 
You know you are my only pet, 
And your absence will cause me to fume and fret; 
They will feed you on salt junk and nasty soft boiled peas, 
Think of this well: Nicodemus ! 
Ere you cross those watery seas, those windy watery seas; 
So she said, Ice. 
And she also said--
Of pumpkins boiled you'll get no more, Oh, Nicodemus I 
Convince yourself of this before, 
You can't run away there's no back door; 
CO 
Reef the anchor, Nicodemus, the Captain hdowill say, 
You'll have to hold on by your eyebrows, 
Or you'll be blown away, straight down to Botany Bay ; 
So she said, &T. 
This is what he said— 
It's no use you talking to me; said Nicodemus ? 
For I 
intend agoing out to sea, 
Out to China for Souchong and Lingo Tea. 
That's a 
profitable cargo. in fact you can't get a 
better, 
Direct from Hong Kong, Austi alio, 
When you send to me a 
letter, you send to me a 
letter. 
And she began again._yelphag,
