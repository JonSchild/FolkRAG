How the MitchelUbt family bought frcm the Barnards 
around 1900; original burned in 1949; had been 
run XXXMX by W's uncle Jess; only wheel was 
left of original bldg but nothing salvaged; 
(never clear about the bldg we were in, was it 
and adjundt bldg that didn't burn}_ 
Present mill uses vertical stones; old ones 
had been flat, horizontal. 
This wheel is "new" — old: 5' wide 18' high 
this one 3 16 
How find Darts in 1949? find used or abandoned 
equipt. restored to use 
Rebuilding of mill in 1949 was done by uncle 
Why would scmeone do that? 
He wanted to beat the power ccmnanies (jest) 
He was a miller, daddy was a miller, he raised 
me and that's where I got to be a miller... 
get com meal in your blood.. 
started as hobby & I went to it full time 
Work also as machinist in Mt Airy 
Been here for about 3 yrs, owned mill for 4 yrs 
Put in the self-rising equipt; put in feed mill 
Rough feeds, dairy cattle 
dairy farmers, cattle farmers were custoners, 
without Q2QHD feed mill (Mitchell shut it down 
because Anoalachian Powere was charging so much 
for electricity — discussed pre-taping) and 
now housewives, local housewives are customers. 
Corn waslocal, but last yr the crop was bad so 
he has been buying it frcm supnly hruses. 
page 2 — BR8-CF-R10 
±2. be plenty of corn this yr; trade corn 
for meal. Store iij bin upstairs, bjrt nothing 
on hand now 
Who buys? Don't know, gone know 
working again as mac inist— 
9 now the power ccmoany has put me cut 
cf business 
10 About putting in a generator run by water 
for $500 or so to generate power. But I'm not 
going back into the feed business, in 13 yrs 
I'll retire and then spend more time with mill 
(been working at job for 12 yrs) 
11 born Collinsville, grew up here Claudville 
Claudville covers three miles square, post office 
raised around this old place; moved away for 25 yrs 
job to job until I got married, travelled in NC, 
Maryland and Washington (DC) 
13 Unble ut the dam in - flume is new, built recently 
by Walter, rots when it sits dry 
Earlier dam on the other creek — this creek is 
Brown's Dan; joined at this point by the Little 
Dan and “ocker's Creek; mill is almost at 
confluence 
First dams were on the Little Dan, washed out 
second dam on Little Dan; 
15 first — railroad irons and planks— irons (rails) 
planted into solid rock 
Creek cane a hugh flood and washed out the first 
one out — back in the forties, about "ten years" 
before the fire. Then #2 — small dam on the 
Little Dan, built a dam of plank, 
in 1949, when all burned, the granite dam went 
into the Brown's Dan — Mt Airy granite; has 
a gate in botton to drain the dam 
17 to permit cleaning; cneeX a TV floated down 
Junk in creek canes from "the Narrows" — 
"good neighbors" throw their junk in the creek. 
W.M. tries to stop them, but to no avail 
16 Seen a big garbage bag there this week — address 
in the bag — from Mt Airy; so I sailed & he 
seemed ashamed when I aalled him 
I try to keep it decent, I like for people to see 
it. ‘“'on's girlfriend painted the sign (name 
collected later: Jane Hill of Claudville) 
This bigg not at all like old one — old one three 
stories, put together with ^egs; this is a little 
20 chicken coop in canoarison 
Between about 1949 and recently it ran down, overgrown 
Uncle got sick; cleared out and rebuilt during four 
years that W.M. had it. W.M. bought frcm Jess's 
son .. he inherited it but sold it to W.

23 CF: Why do it? 
WM: Not too many of these, doen it more less 
out of curi usiy, snent $13000 to get it running 
incl cost of feed mill; haven't got a third of 
it back; power con nay knocked me down 
CF: Motives? 
WM: My uncle wanted to see it run so badt 
I thought H I wou d ... sentimental reasons 
no income 
wife is tick&fed over it, she sells meal when I'm 
24 gone 
have son and daughter son goes to schoo at Norfolk 
Son helpdd restbre it — daughter wants mill in the 
family, I think he would sell it, daughter doesn't 
want it to leave family; she wants will fixes so 
he can’t sell it 
26 Work — winter, cold, keen ice off wheel; break
