Micronesian ancestors no longer speak to their descendants,  for the
 
descendants have ceased to listen, and have lost understanding of
 
the once-rich, now partially-obsolete vocabularies, the raunchy idioms,
 
the complex metaphors, the terse  (
almost short-hand)  code expressions
 
that ancestors used to express their poignant, most tender, most robust
 
sentiments--even brutal sentiments  (when brutality best served a commu-
nity's need to survive); and to define social behavior, and to dictate
 
rules of conduct and decorum and loyalty that once stabilized and gave
 
meaning and delight and confidence to island lives .
 .
 .
 generation
 
after generation after generation,  from time of void and myth and the
 
creation of islands up to a time when our very oldest citizens were
 
the promising young generation of these same islands.
 
Poetical expression came naturally to the ancestors, and songs, chants,
 
and epics set to poetical cadence and  (
often)  to rhyme, were the medium
 
by which a complete, practical,  sometimes pragmatic but always honorable,
 
cultural heritage was comprehended and preserved and transmitted--almost
 
as if it had been engraved in tablets of stone.
 For the ancestors these
 
songs, chants, and epics were their Book of Genesis, their Book of Kings,
 
their Psalms, their Songs of Solomon, their Magna Charta.
 
This is particularly true of the Trukese oral literature which goes back
 
to the time when supreme god lifted Truk Lagoon islands from ocean's depth
 
and brought forth the first Trukese man and woman to populate them; a time
 
of creation when gods and men communicated freely to establish a system of
 
behavior and belief that became the distinctive and powerful cultural heri-
tage of all Trukese, and that shaped much of the history (both recorded and
 
legendary) of the Western Pacific--that continues even now to influence the
 
behavior and attitudes of village Trukese and of the descendancts of those
 
Trukese who once migrated to Saipan and who now constitute its considerable
 
Carolinian population
 .
 .
 subliminally, thouqh, for the source of this
 
heritage, these chants and songs,  is being forgotten.

A truly ancient oral literature deali ng  w ith ear
th' s crea
tion  an d fi rst  
gods no longer exists in the Northern Marianas, and poetical creativity,
 
so far as it can be documented, began and ended with a period of notable
 
cultural achievement, a kind of social and '
literary' Renaissance when
 
traditional Chamorro ways of life fused with Spanish manners and customs,
 
Spanish mores, Spanish music, Spanish verse-making--a fusion that many
 
look back on as a time when traditional cultural values were heightened
 
on these islands, a time when ordinary people turned naturally to poetical
 
expression and created some of the most intensely human and sensitive
 
poetry in all folk lore.
 It should be noted that traditionally these
 
verses were improvised before eager audiences, and performers were judged
 
by their technical competence at instantaneous improvisations, a skill
 
that few Chamorrita singers possess today (
though several Rota singers
 
maintain this skill).
 Fortunately for us, many of the best of these
 
improvised songs have been remembered and now constitute the repertoire
 
of the few old people who can qualify as Chamorrita performers.
 
The oral literature of all Micronesia is in acute danger of extinction.
 
The present study, however, concerns itself only with preservation of the
 
oral poetical literature in the Northern Mariana Islands, and was designed
 
originally to give equal attention to preserving the literature of its two
 
ethnic groups:
 the majority Spanish-influenced Chamorro group and the
 
minority Carolinian group whose ancient heritage came with ancestors from
 
either Truk or Yap depending on the area from which they migrated.
 Recovery
 
of the traditional Chamorro poetry has been wonderfully successful for a
 
number of participants in Programs for the Aged, especially on Rota, have
 
shown themselves to be competent and eager singers and interpreters of
 
Chamorro songs.
 But discovery of Carolinian poetry has been discouraging,
 
so discouraging that I am forced to the conclusion that most of this material
 
is now beyond recall and must be regarded as extinct.
 I have found only one
 
Carolinian chant that was sufficiently intact to be reconstructed and used.
 
To partially compensate for this Carolinian deficiency, it was decided to
 
use materials from Truk and Yap that were once the basis for Carolinian lore.
 
Here we were very fortunate in being able to enlist the cooperation of Truk's

 Lack of time has prevented
 
discovery of a Yapese informant who could act in this role.
 
most celebrated and revered singer and compiler of Trukese chants and
 
I must acknowledge that the original ambitious design for the program
 
(
comprehensive compiling of the oral poetry of the Northern Mariana Islands)
 
has not been accomplished, but I assert emphatically that the material as
 
it exists stands on its own merit and reveals that a substantial and worthy
 
body of poetry exists which gives new insight into the sophistication and
 
esthetic orientation of these unlettered ancestors, and that reveals, above
 
any, other available source, the cultural heritage that they have bequeathed
 
their descendants.
 Collectively these poems are a statement that transcends
 
in depth of emotion and candor and insight anything that historians have
 
written.
 Though incomplete and, no doubt, defective in details of presen-
tation, they are the Northern Mariana Islands only anthology of its survi-
ving poetry.
 
To know these poems one must first know the world from which they came,
 
for literal translations nearly always leave them embarrassingly bare of
 
apparent content, and stripped of the extensive annotations that a know-
ledgeable audience unconsciously and eagerly supplies.
 First, consider
 
the problems that are specific to the Chamorro material.
 Here is an
 
example:

A rendition that, by itself, falls flat to the uninitiated, both in
 
Chamorro and in the literal English translation.  And this is a shame:
 For
 
this poem is from a song that stirs deep emotions in an audience of old
 
Chamorro-speakers who relish the insight it gives them into a bygone social
 
order where a wife, by wifely subtlety, could bring a macho husband under
 
her minute control, even to the extent of getting the shirt off his back;
 
and then disguise her motives by the trickery of self-abasement:
 admitting
 
(
or at least pretending)  that she had improvidently used up all her
 
good arrow-root starch and must, to her shame, use lowly-esteemed rice-
water instead.
 Thus was a macho society controlled by faminine wiles
 
and ingenuity; and, at the same time, entertained by its singers' reve-
lation of the routine antics of clever, aggressive Chamorro wives.
 
An attempt has been made to go one step beyond literal translation and
 
incorporate essential, missing information into the poems themselves so
 
that their full intent becomes clear to modern readers and reclaims for
 
them some of the esthetic joy that is intrinsic in the poems.
 This has
 
usually meant abandonment of the original four-lined-rhymed stanza form;
 
and the completed poems, edited in this way, should be regarded as modern
 
poems based on the Chamorro version rather than as their precise interpre-
tation.
 
These Chamorro poems, by convenient and fortunate coincidence, came ex-
clusively from the small island of Rota  (
though some of them survive on
 
Saipan and Tinian), where Gerald M. Calvo, who has made most of their
 
literal translations,  is coordinator of the Program for the Aged.
 Tra-
ditional way of life is strong on Rota and its aging members are a strong
 
and respected minority.
 I am told that the language of the Chamorro songs
 
is antique, classic Chamorro, perhaps of the order of Spencerian English;
 
and it is important that the one who made the literal translations was in
 
position to repeatedly question his informants on the precise meaning of
 
each phrase, not only for its literal meaning but also for all it connotes
 
of the social order that dominated island life when these same people were
 
young, and sang these songs to each other in courtship and to explain them-
selves to one another.
 
This material is presented,  for sake of coherence, first in its final,
 
edited form, and then in the original Chamorro side-by-side with its
 
literal translation.
 Several of the original poems and their literal
 
translations stand alone without editing into modern English poetic form.

The one Carolinian poem that I have found on Saipan,  has been recons-
tituted from fragments,  and its complete vernacular form,  so far as I know,
 
no longer exists.
 But it is a remarkable poem and I include it as an exam-
pie of a literature that has been allowed to perish.

*  Carolinians on Saipan have forgotten their origin.
 Their language indicates
 
kinship with islanders of the Western Truk or Eastern Yap districts.
 This
 
chant, with its reference to a 'red canoe' suggests that it originated in the
 
area of Satawal in the eastern Yap area, where the great ocean-going, out-
rigger canoes were traditionally (
and still are)  red.
 
* *
 
To search all islands of the known '
inhabited world',  if necessary, & to
 
find and fetch (
possibly by force)  the miscreant relatives--a dangerous
 
assignment.
 
The above poems represents one 'root' of the Northern Mariana Islands'
 
Carolinian heritage.
 Other 'roots' are in the oral literature that came
 
with those ancestors who migrated from the Truk* area, but which are now
 
remembered imperfectly or in fragments.
 To recover these  '
roots' we must
 
look to Truk itself.
 There the oral literature, though fading, is still
 
considerable, and has an intact central core of epics and admonitions that
 
are of profound social consequence.
 This core of central belief is the
 
province of Itang, an hereditary, near-priest cast, that has preserved,
 
cherished, and guarded the material in its own secret, metaphorical language.
 
Access to it has been hampered by secrecy until Chief Kintoki Joseph and
 
several others have become concerned that the entire literature will soon be
 
lost unless it is recorded in written form and placed in the public archives.
 
*  Similar  '
roots' may exist for those who migrated from islands in the Yap area;
 
have not yet located informants from that area who can prove this point.

Chief Kintoki recently spent one week in Saipan reciting chant after chant
 
after chant from his remarkably fertile memory.  And after each recitation
 
he spent at least half an hour explaining its implied contents and its his-
toric or legendary associations.
 Nachsa Siren, who made the literal trans-
lations and is head of the Trust Territory Environmental Protection Agency,
 
is my long-term friend.
 He regards Chief Kintoki Joseph with the reverence
 
that he should since Kintoki is his chief on Udot Island (
in the Truk Lagoon)
 
where both claim residence.
 No doubt Trukese readers, just as Nachsa, will
 
have difficulty with the vernacular text.  Nachsa said,  "I can understand
 
most of the Trukese words, but not the way they are put together; and, except
 
for Chief Kintoki's explanations I would be unsure of my translation."... And
 
I
, if I had not spent many hours talking to Nachsa and the Chief (and, no
 
doubt, had not lived three years in Truk in a Trukese village), would have
 
had no confidence at all in trying to see this material in its context of a
 
Trukese universe that began in void and myth with just one man and woman, and
 
evolved into an ordered social structure that we can still admire, and whose
 
acculturation we must now lament.
 I must apologize to Trukese readers that
 
space limitation prevents the inclusion of the vernacular and literal English
 
texts at this time.

HUK:  THE BEGINNING
 
I speak the Beginning:
 
Soukachau who with one woman
 
first inhabited Chuk*
 
Soukachau whose seed is the seed of all
 
born on these islands
 
Soukachau,  first parent, creator of laws--
eternal demigod of Chuk
 
I am Soukachau
 
Who with one woman
 
Sailed a canoe West from Rock**
 
home of the gods, demigods,  & the first people
 
West beyond mankind's profoundest knowledge
 
West into Ocean's Void, next its very Brink
 
As commanded by Anulapelap
 
mightiest of mighty gods
 
Whose very hand was with us & steadied our course
 
among the great waves
 
Exhausted, near death, came to
 
Tonamar Island where we rested three days
 
Then Anulapelap spoke:
 
"Not here, not here on this bare sand.
 For beyond the next
 
horizon are mountains /Chuk/ that I have prepared for thee,
 
that I have lifted from ocean's bottom & molded for thee &
 
thy descendants.  Bide thy fierce thirst, thy fierce hunger
 
seven more days only, and Chuk's springs shall refresh thee"
 
Thus spoke great God
 
And the seven more days' thirst & famine
 
were as nothing
 
For in seven days there stood before us
 
A mighty mountain
 
Sheer & wonderful, new-made & empty
 
And I called it Tonachau
 
For its peak pierced the clouds
 
And the dry land I first stepped onto
 
I called Metchitew--
Metchitew on Tonachau's flat, narrow foot
 
Where sweet spring water flows freely
 
There built I the first hut &
 
There the race of Soukachau multiplied mightily
 
From the seed of Soukachau
 
In the womb of one woman
 
*  Chuk:
 Traditional name for Truk; means  'mountain'; rhymes with duke.
 
**Rock:
 Refers to Kosrae.
 Trukese name for Kosrea is Acahu which translated
 
to Rock quite appropriately since Kosrae is an island of high rocky pinnacles,
 
peaks,  and crags.

In the Beginning one clan only:
 Sapunupi
 
And there was no incest
 
Until
 
Strange sounds were heard in the night
 
In the hut
 
Outside the hut
 
Sweet, low, pleading
 
Cried Soukachau
 
When he heard these sounds of love
 
"0 my children, this cannot be
 
Willfully ye disobey thy father
 
Willfully ye break sacred laws
 
Willfully ye shame & sorrow me
 
0, if each of ye had but one ear like the octupus
 
Ye would be teachable
 
But thy ears are in many rows like sharks' ears
 
And listen in all directions at once
 
Abomination on ye!
 
Abomination on thy father & on thy mother's womb,"
 
And the sons answered
 
"In all ways but one do we honor thee & obey thee
 
In all ways but one hast thou provided for our needs
 
But our need for the soft flesh of women
 
only our sisters can provide"
 
And he drove them from his presence & from his clan
 
And each couple became a clan on a different part of_Wono
 
though Soukachau remained their honored Samol /
chie f/
. This
 
was the origin of multiple clans on Chuk.

Great wooden urns piled full of pounded breadfruit and baked fish are carried

Turning away from the people,  the narrator bows solemnly in all four directions,
 
then looks up at the thatch over the HAS & shouts  exultingly:
 
And ye, ye hungry multitude of jhosts
 
Both benign & evil
 
Who watch over us

Ye whom I have removed from this holy place

Know that in God's food
 
There is fellowship & well-being & nourishment
 
For all Trukese & for all
 
Their unseen gods & ghosts
 
Who attend them.
 
At this point the narrator throws the remaining food at the ceiling of the RAS
 
until the thatch is dripping with it;  &, also, at which point fermented palm
 
wine appears & is passed from hand to hand far into the night & the last drop
 
is gone.

Prepare youselves for our good meal."
 
We are terrified

Itang Chief's spirit is on fire
 
And will consume the universe

Hastily cool him down with water from bottom of the lagoon
 
Cook him 0 cool him emphatically

Ah,  his head is cold,  cold enough to eat
 
Are his arms cold?
 
Cold enough to bake
 
Are his legs cold?
 
Cold enough to boil
 
And his heart?
 
Cold enough to sacrifice
 
Come,  then,  Itang Chief
 
Come as our lover
 
come to our cooking pots & meet God of the Rainbow
 
He will chew you & swallow you
 
What will he chew?
 
He will chew your head
 
And swallow it
 
He will chew your arms
 
And swallow them
 
He will chew your legs
 
And gulp them down

And make us invincible
 
Come to us d

MORAL F
OR WARRIORS
 
Seinon, his name
 
Souofeng, his clan
 
which means Sea Snake
 
Udot, his home
 
Brave Seinon,  noble Seinon
 
Strong & lithe as a god
 
Udot's famous Sea Snake
 
And when Murino*
 people
 
Distant & near Earth's edge
 
said
 
"Our enemies on Nomwin*
 require dstruction"
 
he sent word
 
"So be it.
 They shall die horribly
 
and with honor"
 
So he built many great war canoes
 
And filled them with
 
a hundred
 
no!
 hundreds
 
no!!
 thousands
 
of warriors,  fierce & painted & full of hate
 
Terror struck Nomwin
 
when people heard these things
 
All trembled on Nomwin
 
when these things were known
 
All save Aunu
 
whose name means Reef
 
Said Aunu,  "I am the Reef that destroys transgressors
 
Sea Snake shall not pass this Reef & live"
 
And he lay awake many nights devising trickery
 
Then to his sweet wife, said
 
"The honor is thine
 
For thou shalt greet Sea Snake to Nomwin
 
Without shame,  sweet wife
 
Shalt thou stand naked on the reef
 
And beguile him to his death--
Thy feminine  wiles
 
for which thou art well known
 
thy musty,  salty sex
 
that men adore
 
Shall keep thee safe
 
Let the flower of thy thighs be seen
 
Opening & closing like a sea clam
 
Until sex-starved from his long voyage
 
Seinon follows thee to ambush on the beach
 
And when he falls on thee
 
In thy tight embrace,  then
 
Shall my spear pass through his body
 
So she stood on the reef
 
Calling to the great warrior
 
*Murino and Nomwin: both in the Hall Islands of Truk, many miles from Udot.
 
"Come take thy fill of love
 
As is proper after a long sea voyage.
 
See how my sex opens & closes like a sea clam
 
0 it is musty & salty
 
And longs for thy penetration."
 
And he left the safety of the sacred lagoon
 
And followed her as a fish
 
going into a fish trap
 
As a trapped turtle waits
 
for the spear that will tear out its heart
 
As a seabird heedlessly
 
dives into a black ocean
 
But so great was his ardor
 
That he did hot notice
 
the spear that pierced his body
 
or that he was dying
 
and that a great battle had been lost
 
I say to thee
 
young, lusty warriors
 
though ye be a fierce & doughty 1 t
 
I say to thee
 
Hark to this true tale & remember it forever
 
That ye never be beguiled as was Seinon
 
By sweet flesh closing & opening as a clam on a reef
 
Or by the sweet, musty, & salty smell of women
 
For killing is thy duty
 
Steadfast & undistracted be ye in battle
 
And faithful, above all, to the spear in thy hands
 
Thus shall the honor of Udot & all its clans
 
be preserved

OMMENT ON TRUKESE MATERIAL
R
in j*7
 
Space constraints and printing costs permit only a fraction of the Trukese
 
material in our possession to be included in this volume.
 But this should
 
be sufficient to indicate that here is an oral literature of high esthetic
 
and social value that should be preserved.
 As I read and reread these poems,
 
the word 'apocalyptic' constantly occurs to me to explain the power and
 
grandeur I feel in them.
 But on reflection I know this is wrong, and that no
 
grand, heavenly-type apocalypse is being foretold, for it had already occurred.
 
It occurred when the first man and woman set foot on Truk.
 All else has been
 
fulfillment and realization of that divine moment,  for Trukese literature,  from
 
its very beginning, defines a perfect world of order and understanding, of
 
authority,  loyalty, and submission.
 And it was the impact of this precise
 
unequivocal vision that molded a millenium of behavior of Trukese who were
 
tutored by it--even of those who migrated from island to island and now live
 
in the Northern Mariana Islands where they are categorized as  '
Carolinian'.
 
This presentation of Trukese poems,  then, is only a sample of the material
 
already in our possession, and, certainly, a very small sample of the
 
material that we believe still exists in those areas which were not surveyed.
 
We hope that the sample will lead to a demand for fuller presentation which
 
will include the original Itang vernacular and its word-for-word literal
 
translation into English.  We hope that there will be demand for the program
 
to be enlarged in scope so that field studies extend beyond Udot Island
 
(where this material came from)  to all Truk lagoon islands, and to the remote
 
outer islands where the tenets of ancient beliefs and ancient precepts are
 
regarded with special reverence and are best preserved.
 We believe that the
 
techniques that were used to unearth and restore the present material should
 
be extended to a much larger program so that a definitive and comprehensive
 
Trukese Testament may be recovered and treasured in archives, in schools, and
 
in homes .
 .
 .
 I postulate that to Trukese  (
and all other dwellers on Western
 
Pacific Islands)  such a compilation,  such a Testament, would be as important
 
as the Dead Sea Scrolls are to scholars of religious and social history; and
 
that it would be a source of enduring pride, for here is palpable evidence
 
that within Trukese lineage there existed poets and philosophers and social
 
stra tegists of truly exceptional qualities.

Rotanese, when speaking Chamorro,  favor antique usage of grammar, words,
 
and phrases; and this is especially apparent when older citizens recall
 
songs that have descended to them from past centuries.
 Gerald Calvo, born
 
and raised on Rota (
college educated, still young)
 'keeps the faith' with
 
local traditions and sets these 'classic' Chamorrita in the authentic verna-
cular in which they actually exist, and that preserves and emphasizes their
 
full Rotanese flavor and origin.

 I came asking your parents for
 
your hand in marriage,
 
and they gave me a year's time of engagement.
 
Maybe I could continue,
 
if I am not hit by sickness.
 
And if I count how many months,
 
twelve months for me to finish off
 
I pray to God, hoping that I won't die.
