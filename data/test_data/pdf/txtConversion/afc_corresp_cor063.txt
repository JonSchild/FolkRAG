Dr. Carida Doggett Corse Florida Writers Project Jacksonville, Florida
Dear Dr. Corse:
Some amount of search has been necessary to locate the approval for copying the
photographs made by the Florida Writers Project in connection with their folk lore
research. I have finally found this approval, however, and can now order the material
necessary for this work. Will you be able to make copies of these photographs for the
Library of Congress if we furnish the materials? The collection is referred to as the
“Collection of Photographs of Folk Singers Photographed in their Native Surroundings”.
Very sincerely yours, Alan Lomax Assistant in Charge Archive of American Folk Songs
