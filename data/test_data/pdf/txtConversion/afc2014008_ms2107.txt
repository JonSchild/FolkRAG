Dear Jeff:
 
Herewith the manuscript.  If any of it  is  illegible,  Un-
understandable,  or otherwise displeases or upsets you,  you
 
can reach me until January 2 (
3?)  at
 
Naomi/John Bishop
 
8378 Faust Avenue
 
West Hills,  California
 91304
 
818/704-9538
 
The Folk Arts Program also has this number and knows  I will
 
be there,  in case you misplace this.
 
You will  find relatively few changes:
 
p.  5 for smoothness
 
p.  16 for vagueness;  I began to worry that this
 
young man could find himself in difficulties with
 
congregations who felt  left out or mistreated for one reason
 
or another,  so  I thought  I wouldn't be so specific in print.
 
p.  18 and 19.  These represent Dan's revision of the
 
figures.  I personally have reworked these "statistics" to try
 
to make them more clear and compelling at  least  five times,
 
and have concluded I will never again mention even one number
 
in any of my future essays.  They are simply too unreliable.
 
I' m not even sure Dan's  figures make real good sense,  but  I
 
wouldn't  change them again for a gold nickel.
 
p.  19 includes our attempts to soften the rhetoric
 
so that  it doesn't  seem as though I am singling out the NEA
 
for attack.  I hope you can read it and that  it makes
 
reasonable sense.
 
p.21  I tried to give the ending a bit more punch.
 
Thanks  for being such a friendly and compassionate editor.
 
And the happiest of holidays to you and all your crew.
 
Yours ever,
 
Bess Lomax Hawes

SEM LECTURE -
-
 9/8/93
 
I haven't been able to think of a good title  for this
 
speech,  mostly,  I think,  because  it  isn't really a speech,
 
it' s more a bunch of reminiscences and observations and
 
exhortations.  (My grandfather on my mother's  side was a
 
Presbyterian minister and so I always have to exhort
 
somebody) .
 But  I wouldn't want you to think  I haven't been
 
taking this  speech seriously;  actually I am greatly honored
 
by your invitation to give this year's
 Seeger lecture.
 I
' ve
 
always  liked and admired ethnomusicologists,  you know -
-
partly because they re generally  just  such a lovable bunch
 
and partly because  I know of few other academic disciplines
 
that are both so tolerant and so self-assured as to allow and
 
even encourage the participation of outriders like myself.
 
But then,  here you are with the Seeger Lectures to put
 
on,  and Charles  Seeger himself was certainly more than a bit
 
of an outrider.
 Overall one could describe him as
 a scholar
 
of music,
 su
e
 he was also a composer,  an
 
arranger,  an editor, an educator,  a statesman and a
 
bureaucrat,  and he worked a great deal  in matters to do with
 
how music might properly and effectively be  included in the
 
purview of government,  and also how music might  itself affect
 
the course of government.
 
Actually,  it's hard to think of a single aspect of the
 
world of music that Charles Seeger didn't at  least express an
 
opinion about.  I first met him in Washington when  I was  15,
 
brought up from Texas by my father John A.  Lomax,  to help him
 
and my brother Alan with their new book,  later to be
 
published as  "Our Singing Country".  It was my first big trip
 
into the big world,
  
 
and my father's distinguished
 
friend,  Charles  Seeger,  at that time seemed immensely old and
 
immensely knowled
ble to me.
 There didn't  seem to be
 
anything that he didn't know and he was  so sharp-minded and
 
precise and sure.  That whole elegant cool New England
 
intellectual style was  completely new to me as a youngster
 
and a southerner besides,  and I was a bit  intimidated by it
 
and by Charley,  truth to tell.  So I turned to his wife,  Ruth
 
Crawford Seeger,  I suppose because she was younger and a bit
 
more approachable.  And she was a wonderful mother besides,
 
and I got  in on  just a bit of that great mothering that  she
 
exuded from every pore.
 
I am sure that Charley would not take  it amiss  if  I
 
reminisce a bit more about Ruth,  for Ruth was a very
 
important  Seeger,  she was  indeed,  and I think that somewhere
 
in the ultimate history of the Seeger lectures,  someone
 
should say so.
 At the time I knew her in the\ ate 30's  she
 
was transcribing the music for "Our Singing Country"  from
 .
 
fatherS and Alan's  field recordings and-- with her left hind
 
foot and a certain amount of household help  (Elizabeth Cotton
 
was  yet to come)  -
-
 she was also raising Michael,  Peggy and
 
Barbara  (Penny
 was yet to come too) .
 The three children were
 
aged somewhere around
 five and three and sort of minus one
 
if my memory is  correct.
 
One of my tasks at the time was to act as liaison
 
between my father and brother,  at their book and record
 
strewn desks  in the
 Library of Congress,
 and Ruth at her
 
home work-station in Silver Spring,  where she was all fitted
 
out with a record player with a massive sixteen inch
 
turntable  for the heavy field recordings plus a set of
 
earphones,  an artist's drafting table with T squares and
 
t
 
rulers and pots ofACarters  India  Ink with which she created
 
her elegantly calligraphed musical scores.
 And then there
 
was a small desk with a few pencils,  a telephone,  and a
 
notebook in which she kept  a tally of the number of times  she
 
listened to every single piece of music in the Our Singing
 
Country corpus.  Occasionally -
-
 as happens not  infrequently
 
in the  imperfect art of transcribing songs -
-
 disagreements
 
would arise between the book authors and the musical editor
 
over particula.r—te-
 or -
evaR interpretations of evanescent
 
and tricky melodies A and it was generally my responsibility
 
to transmit messages  from one camp
 f -
a
+e
 to the
 
other.
 "Bess,  you tell Ruth that no blues  singer God ever
 
made would sing  'redder than rouge'  -
-
 it's  'redder than
 
ru(by)'  with a voice break in the middle-- that's why she
 
doesn't hear it  right."
 "Now,  Bess,  you go back and tell
 
Alan and your father that  I have listened to this  song
 
exactly 78 times all the way through,  not mentioning single
 
verses.
 How many times have they listened to it?  Get them to
 
tell me that."
 
It was quite an education,  and I was at the  same time
 
being allowed the opportunity to observe an extraordinarily
 
r +e
.
 
talented and
 ±-ft
 woman functionning in a multiplicity of
 
roles that must have been tearing her apart.
 At one point
 
that year all the children got whooping cough and had to stay
 
home from their day-care center and they played,  rolling
 
about  like so many puppies on the living room rug noisily but
 
pleasantly enough  ("Gentle voices,  gentle voices",  Ruth kept
 
singing to them),  until a whoop would start.  The victim would
 
trot docilely off to the bathroom to throw up and Ruth would
 
take off her earphones and go into the kitchen to make a
 
little restorative snack for the sufferer,  see to it that he
 
or she got  it down,  and then return to the  79th careful
 
listening to
 "Go Down,  You Old Red Rising Sun" or the  112th
 
to  "Bonaparte's Retreat Across the Rocky Mountains"
 
And then Charley would come home  from work -
 was  it then
 
the Writers Project or the Pan American Union? -
 and every-
thing would stop.  He would beam largely around upon us all
 
and give Barbara  (
the crib baby)  a special flare of his hand,
 
a kind of starfish effect that  she would always return in
 
kind;  and then special hugs all round and a nice  settle-down
 
by the fireplace with  (generally)  Peggy on his knee.  The rest
 
of us  showed off for his attention,  but at heart the family
 
action always  really swirled around Ruth it  seemed to me.
 
Oh dear Ruth.
 She was  indeed so dear that the children
 
and even Charley called her "Deo".  She taught me a lot about
 
how to be a grown-up and a woman and for that  I will never
 
forget her,  but  she also taught me something else that  she
 
possibly wasn't aware of.  She taught me that professional,
 
academically trained,  avant garde,  politically radical,
 
totally up to the minute musicians like Charles Seeger and
 
Ruth Crawford Seeger could and did stand in awe of the
 
musical achievements of old country ladies,  black stevedores,
 
Mexican field workers,  Ohio canal boat captains,  and all the
 
other amazing casts of characters my father and brother had
 
been for so long re-introducing to their own homeland
 
audiences.  I already sort of knew all this,  of course,  but  it
 
4L r
c-a  
 
was Ruth who diagrammed out -
for me,,how smoothly and
 
inevitably a 5/4 meter worked in a Cajun ballad,  how
 
rhythmically complex an apparently routine Kentucky fiddle
 
tune turned out to be,  how a meltingly liquid Alabama field
 
holler really defied standard music notation.  And so it was
 
through Ruth and Charles Seeger that  I began to realize that
 
the musics  I had heard most of
 my life on field recordings
 
were,  in their exceptional performances,  as totally excellent
 
as the exceptional performances of any other musical
 
tradition -
-
 even the Baroque,  even the Romantic.
 
For  I had been brought up as a classical pianist,  and
 
although I had heard field recordings all my life,  I found
 
myself following
 Charles and Ruth through their process of
 
discovery in dealing with my father's and brother's
 
recordings with  just a bit of their feelings of genuine
 
surprise.  The senior Seegers had listened widely to the
 
musics of Africa and the far East but,  like most musicians of
 
their day,  they had not heard the United States,  and thus
 
their entire musical training -
-
 sophisticated and wide-
ranging as  it was -
-
 had not prepared them for the sonorities
 
of north Georgia shape note hymn singing or Mississippi
 
African American work choruses.  Hearing Ruth and Charles
 
Seeger professionally and seriously discussing the musical
 
qualities of field hollers and banjo tunes opened a door that
 
I hadn't  known was closed,  and made me  literally face the
 
music.
 
For you see,  in the other part of my day,  I was being
 
trained by my father and my brother as a folklorist as well.
 
My particular responsibility at the time -
-
 and at the age of
 
15  it was a mind-boggling assignment,  especially since it was
 
for real -
-
 was to help annotate the songs that were being
 
put  into  "Our Singing Country":  that  is,  I was to search
 
through other collections of traditional songs and ballads  in
 
order to be able to cite parallel texts and tunes  from which
 
the history of  individual  songs might one day be established.
 
I read through all the great  literary collections -
-
 Child,
 
Sharp,  Randolph,  Belden,  Frank C,  Brown -
-
 and I could see
 
v'  4
a+Le
, 
what these great collectors 
A were talking about:  there were
 
indeed songs -
 specific conjoined texts and tunes -
 that
 
seemed to move  independently,  infinitely flexible but somehow
 
invariably recognizable no matter in what guise they turned
 
up.
 
For even the world of music was  in many ways  confined to
 
print  in those days,  and it was because of the
 
unchallengeable authority of the printing press that we were
 
still laboring almost exclusively with   
p
from the pre-
electronic past although my own father and brother were major
 
leaders  in using the new and developing electronic capacities
 
to capture the actual act  of musical performance.
 
But  certainly
 most  folk music lovers of the 30's and
 
40' s  still thought that  it was "the song"-- an intact package
 
of words and one or two particular tunes -
-
 that  really
 
mattered,  so that we constantly hunted for "good ones" that
 
could encircle the globe and bring us all together and solve
 
all manner of problems and make us brave and fearless and
 
educate us to our beautiful differences.  And so we happily
 
chased songs around the countryside and when we caught one we
 
thought nothing of writing
 a simplified version of it down
 
and publishing it and fixing it up in ways that would make it
 
especially appealing to one kind of taste or another and
 
teaching it to all manner of other people.  And that was a
 
good thing to do;  all of us have grown in wisdom and humanity
 
because we heard and learned our great  songs.
 
ieS
e
 
throughout history,  most people b
.ad thought that
 
e
 
folk and traditional musics existed i c !
.q  to entertain the
 
masses and to inspire,  feed and nourish the higher musical
 
arts anyway.  A lot of people still think so.  When  I was a
 
teen-ager working at the Library of Congress,  such eminent
 
composers as Aaron Copland and Virgil Thompson came in
 
looking for some interesting musical folk idioms but most
 
particularly for some  solid and long-lasting melodies for use
 
in their symphonic compositions.  And I helped find the field
 
recordings that they listened to and later put to extensive
 
use.
 Charles Seeger himself composed a symphonic
 
variation that wove together 7 or 8 of the many elegant
 
melodies  folks had developed for a single romantic ballad,
 
"John Riley".  (It was years  later that  I heard Leonard
 
Bernstein say that he thought the hardest  single part of
 
musical composition was to latch on to a really good and
 
memorable tune.
 No wonder American composers were interested
 
to  find an archive full of them!
 
So the composers  sat  in the Archive of American Folksong
 
jotting down the tunes of the songs they heard,  and
 
professional copyists  copied down any transcribed tunes they
 
could find so that music publishers could copyright them,  and
 
the people who wanted to learn songs or teach them to
 
children in school looked inside  folk song books  for sources
 
of material,  and folklorists spent months and years chasing
 
down the original author/composer of particular songs
 
believing sincerely that when they had found that out,  they
 
would know the single thing that was the most  important to
 
know about them.  Remember,  every song was a thing and things
 
have makers and copiers and owners ) and big money-making
 
industries can be built around them 
)and were.  But the
 
recording machine
 took the song out of the book
 
and the library and the printing press and brought  it to life
 
as  an event  in time and space.
 
But each time a song was  recorded it was a new event and
 
these things multiplied and pretty soon each song was
 
a conglomeration of multiple events complete with multiple
 
variations and after a while what on earth was it you were
 
dealing with?
 I remember hearing Charles Seeger say once
 
that the only truly unchangeable and therefore copyrightable
 
thing about a piece of music was the pattern of the grooves
 
cut  into a record.  And now we don't even have grooves any
 
more, and we are  still dealing with the challenging
 effects
 
of this revolutionary shift of emphasis  from print to sound,
 
on h ve
ómmented on
 
thJ
i
t perhaps not  from the perspective  I saw it as  it was
 
happening.
 
It  always was a struggle.  For the early recordists to do
 
their field work,  it was not only an intellectual and social
 
struggle but a downright physical one as well.  Even after the
 
period of the cyllinder and the  fearsome horn into which only
 
the RCA dog seemed able to sing with any pleasure,  came the
 
enormous back-breaking "portable" recording machines,  each
 
one run off of 4 to  6 automobile batteries,  and served by
 
weighty boxes of 16  inch discs.  At one point  in the 40s when
 
Father took the daring step of buying a brand new Ford to
 
take him just once more through the southern backwoods,  he
 
had the garage rip out the whole back seat and install a
 
built-in platform with a special  set of shock absorbers to
 
accomodate the burden.
 And I will spare you my views of the
 
horrors of the  subsequent wire recorders,  their,f
l uge tangled
 
spools eyed grimly by the most dauntless of
 sound
 
engineers.
 
But  other major consequences kept on rippling out  from
 
the central disturbance -
-
 for example the specific singer of
 
a song,  typically recognized in print by a simple footnote,
 
became in recordings a person of prominence and importance,
 
a performing artist".  Indeed in popular music,  the name of
 
the artist came to be
 more commercially valuable than the
 
name of the songs 
- ecording contracts were proof of that,
 
even saving royalty money by requiring singers to compose
 
their own  songs  since nobody much cared about what song they 
anyway.  (
Parenthetically,  this ,I believe
 
accounts at  least to a degree for the massive decline in
 
quality of the American popular song in recent years;  there
 
are  lots more good song singers than song writers.)
 
Another major change was the enormous  increase in the
 
availability for the general listener of both local American
 
and worldwide musics.  Only fifty years ago  
 
you could not listen  seriously to African-American work song
 
singers or Mexican-American corridistas or Anglo-American
 
shape note congregations unless you travelled to the place
 
where they were actually making the music or visited the
 
Archive of American Folk Songs at the Library of Congress or
 
the Sound Archives at the University of Indiana.  There were
 
some spasmodic commercial recordings but basically it was
 
these somewhat daunting academic archives that held in trust
 
the voices of the varied peoples of the United States -
-
 the
 
non-standard,  specialized,  quirky,  powerful,  angry,  hopeful
 
people who had broken free  from the second-handedness of
 
print and allowed their especial musical talents,  their
 
especial musical visions,  and their own private voices to be
 
recorded for the benefit of -
-
 God knows who they thought.
 
I recently listened to some old field recordings my
 
father made and every time he recorded a tune he said,  "This
 
song was  sung by Mister so and so of such and such a town
 
recording on thus and such a date for the Library of Congress 
in Washington " He made it  sound so important.  Maybe they
 
thought the Congress was going to listen to them -
-
 or maybe
 
President Roosevelt.  Maybe,  in a way,  that's'4 4-&-of what did
 
happen;  things  certainly aren't the same as they used to be.
 
For whenever  I like  I can now listen to the major
 
repertoires of hundreds of different world-wide cultures and
 
almost every small group in every state in the union. (
If I
 
had my brother' s magical "Global Jukebox" at my personal
 
disposal,  I could not only triple or quadruple this
 
repertoire but vastly enhance with critically important
 
ethnographic information and film the musics available to me
 
at a fingertip) .  And all this richness  is right there for
 
anybody --awkward .

-erc.  Thanks to the prevailing recording machine,
 
these musics are no longer within the private purview of the
 
people who happen to live  in a particular part of the world,
 
or the people who have troubled to go to that part of the
 
world,  or the people who have announced themselves to be
 
world music students  and scholars.
 
And this  is a brand new state of affairs.  The nature,
 
significance and responsibilities of the work of folklore and
 
ethnomusicology have changed forever.  Nothing is a simple
 
one-way street anymore.  Everything works differently in
 
imponderable and disconcerting ways.  A couple of years ago
 a
 
Boston friend told me a story about a Masssachusetts student
 
of African music who had climaxed his  studies by spending
 
several years  in a particular African nation as a disciple of
 
a particular master tribal drummer.  Upon his  return to the
 
United States,  the young student  determined to try to
 
recreate  in all  its glory the marvellous music he had tried
 
to learn,  and in the process he transformed himself into a
 
one-man band,  attaching pulleys and levers to his body
 
through which he could sound the bell pattern with his  right
 
hand while he led the mama drum with his  left  foot and
 
handled the shakers by nodding his head and so forth.  It was
 
an enormously complex venture and he was  legitimately proud
 
when he could finally bring it all off,  cross -rhythms and
 
all.  And then
 he heard that his old teacher from Africa was
 
coming to town with a visiting troupe.  He delightedly made an
 
appointment to see him at his hotel,  he arrayed himself for a
 
triumphal performance and he played his heart out.  And his
 
teacher looked at him affectionately and remarked,  "Oh,  you
 
poor fellow.  Don't you have any friends?"
 
Here we  see African musical  standards being applied to
 
European musical tactics and what are we to make of that?
 
The communicative dyad is more of a triad or a quartet or
 
chorus these days,  and folklorists and ethnomusicologists are
 
no  longer lonely explorers  into uncharted areas  ( f

Folklorists are perhaps a bit more used to this,  since
 
their work though generally distributed in print ) has used the
 
alphabet  rather than specialized notation methods and has
 
always emphasized the English language.  And as general
 
literacy became the norm ) folklorists'  so-called informants
 
could and did read the books  in which their material was
 
printed and they were duly critical of the results,  all the
 
way from how the book royalties were handled,  down to the

So none of us who consider ourselves  scholars,  lovers,
 
savants,  of music s any longer work
 But

irrelevant.  In fact  I believe that the work of
 
the afficionado,  the dedicated student
 -the deep lover of
 
particular art  forms  (from
' Vi  4
 inside and outside the culture)
 
may become ever more  impor'tant and ever
more crucial as time
 
goes by.  One of the more troubling assumptions of our period
 
is that any member of any group b
simple virtue of that
 
membership
 has an inborn
 unmatchable intellectual tie
 
'
 
with its  cultural manifestations.  Not  s
-a.  It
 oüld be so nice
 
if it were
 but many -
 possibly even most
 
people both of the majority and of smaller groups are simply
 
not  interested.  They have chosen to focus their efforts upon
 
other fields,  and that  is well.  We don't need everyone to be
 
a cultural authority.  But we do need some ,
\ and it  is plain
 
that the kind of perspective essential to the understanding
 
of any art  form is developed through intense,  disciplined and
 
comparative study,  no matter if the student  is an insider or
 
an outsider of the particular culture.  For both it represents
 
hard self-dedicated work and attentiveness,  the kind of
 
strict professional attention I saw Ruth and Charles Seeger
 
devoting to my father's and brother's  field recordings.
 
But what,  in another fifty years,  will be there be for
 
us  insiders or outsiders,  or our insider and outsider grand-
children,  to study? When I look at a record or

c. d.  these days and note the date when the recording was
 
actually made,  I begin to wonder.  They were all made so long
 
ago.  Even the new ones tend to be re-releases.  In fact,  when
 
I talk to young people today about how they should be doing
 
field work,  especially
 recording,  they tell me gently that
 
all that  kind of thing has already been done.  And I laugh,
 
but then could it  really be true? Can it really be that the
 
peoples of the world are abandoning their own glorious
 
historical musical achievements  in order that their young
 
people can grab a few dimes off of today's amplified pop
 
music merry-go-round? Or letting their music go on the cheap
 
so that  somebodyfrom the popular music world or any other
 
musical world can fix it up the way zwnvW *6_*

back in the  fall of  1975  I attended my first  SEM
 
meeting with the idea of telling the membership that during
 
the  summer of 1976 a marvellous event was to take place  in
 
Washington,  D.C.  -
-
 a summer-long Festival of American Folk
 
Life during which traditional artists  from across the United
 
States would conjoin with traditional artists  from their
 
original country or tribe.  At the least,  I said in my naive
 
enthusiasm,  exciting previously unheard musicians would be
 
appearing on the Mall
 and at the best,  some significant
 
interchanges between old and new world musicians might occur
 
that might  lead to some re-invigoration of marginal musics.
 
I was quite unprepared for the general  lack of
 
enthusiasm my report  received.  I was gently informed by one
 
responding speaker that the events  I was projecting
 were
 
only of marginal interest to the Society,  that festivals were
 
purely temporal events of no long-term consequence,  that the
 
true function of ethnomusicology was to record reality -
 -  
in this period,  the  inevitable gradual decline of local
 
musics under the onslaught of national popular musics.

appropriateness of their participation in such events.  Their
 
training had been that  scholars  should always remain separate
 
from the topic they study and that they must  in every way
 
attempt not to  influence the course of its development. ( This
 
is,  if nothing else,  a position that grants a genuine dignity
 
to both parties  involved -

 the  students and the  studied.  But
 
others had other points of view.

neutrality's making for awfully boring conversations, *&

I think this position over-estimates
 
the actual weight and importance of
 opinions.  At the Folk
 
Arts Program in the Arts Endowment we  found out quickly the
 
limits of outsider views -
 even those that are backed by
 
grants money -
 for although our scholarly panel might vote
 
not to fund a project,  the  local  folks very often went  right
 
on ahead and did it anyway.  Af

 but generally we serve
 
inter-connecting functions.  So most of the time we needn't

anything in particular or that we will do anything

 we have an obligation to do as well as we can
 
just whatem ow it  is that we do.  Ethnomusicologists are
 
important parts of human society and we are supposed to be in
 
there pitching.  If we weren't there,  we would have to be
 
invented,  for music is  important.In the NEA Folk Arts Program
 
Dan Sheehy,  Terry Liu,  Barry Bergey,  a host of collaborators
 
and I have had that proven to us over and over again as we
 
watched a fifteen year spectacle of musical situations
 
develop,  misfire,  subside,  explode and thrive. And we learned
 
that every form of music is  i mportant  for somebody no matter
 
how micro the music or the population.
 Music is the ultimate
 
morale builder;  its absence is always associated with
 
listlessness and anomie.  Ethnomusicologists all really know
 
this,  and when they ask me what
 
can do to help the
 
musics of the world flourish in the strange times we live in,
 
I tell them t
ç4 lots of things -
-
 most of them very simple,
 
all of them quite consonant with their academic and scholarly
 
responsibilities:
 
For one thing,  every ethnomusicologist  can devote energy
 
to the performance of the  simple  straightforward Ruth Seeger
 
manouvre,  continually and publicly pointing out the
 
complexity and interest of the musical  forms that  surround us
 
in the world.  It's a truism that  all teaching doesn't have to

take place in a classroom,  but we need to look actively for
 
more opportunities to make what we know more widely available

language and data that will help them defend their own
 
musics.,

as  invented a brand new
 
way of teaching within a festival ê
v calling for
 "pop-up
 
presenters",  people
 who will wander around in crowds
 
starting conversations about the performances,  drawing
 
attention to their technical complexity,  their originality,
 
showing people how to listen.  That's teaching.
 
And
 every ethnomusicologist can  look carefully
 
about the place where he is-- not where she might  like to be
 
-
-
 noting the kind of people who live there,  finding out what
 
their musical state of life is,  assessing the vitality and
 
the artistry that  lives or droops or thrives  in the
 
surrounding community.  Always remember that the United States
 
is the end point of most of the recent mass human migrations
 
and we therefore willy-nilly host many world-level artists
 
here.  Many of them are in fine shape,  but  far too many are
 
disconnected,  despondent,  out of practice,  embarrassed,
 
angry,  desperately in need of an interpreter,  a mentor,  some
 
help in cracking through to audiences  in this new land.
 
I find the number of ethnomusicologists who have no
 
knowledge of or connection with the musical  life of the place
 
where they live most troubling.  And it's an interesting
 
contrast with folklorists who have
 
aA 
v
.
tendency to work
 
within their own geographic area,, while èthnbmusicologists
 
really seem to want to go far afield.  It's noticeable even in
 
the classroom;  an ethmomusicologist  is  far more likely to
 
bring to class a visiting
 Chinese musician than a local
 
blues guitarist while a folklorist will take  just the
 
opposite tack.  Perhaps we  should  join  forces,  but  since  I
' m
 
talking to ethnomusicologists )
, I will urge
 u  -
&  look
 
with greater care into
 own  local musical community
 
resources.  Musicians,  after all,  need to be employed.  If they
 
don't get  jobs,  they stop being musicians and do something
 
else.  It's as  simple as that;  if you want musicians to
 
thrive,  get them some work.
 
And then every ethnomusicologist  can and should function
 
as a critic.  Maintenance of standards  is absolutely essential
 
to the health of any art form.  It  is easy enough for a
 
production of "Oklahoma" or even  "Carmen" to get a sensible
 
and informed response  from a general audience along with some
 
good ideas  in next day's newspaper reviews  for the
 
improvement of future performances.  This is not the case for
 
the multi-cultural festivals,  for the  "visiting national
 
troupe from the Caucasus" or for the local Chinese opera
 
production.  All these efforts deserve and could benefit
 
enormously from carefully thought out, engaging and well-
informed
 professional response.  This may require  some of us
 
to do some extra homework;  well,that's  invigorating,isn't  it?
 
And finally,  every ethnomusicologist should take on the
 
responsibility of developing some minimal degree of practical
 
entrepreneurship,  learning how to make our special musics
 
broadly accessible.  There are  so many ways to do this -
-
 good
 
solid academic ways.
 
I recently read a report  from a folklorist who became
 
fascinated with a particular African-American religious  song
 
tradition practiced in rural areas around his host
 
university.
 He  followed it  from little church to  little
 
church,  mapped out  its provenience,  made friends with the
 
folks who sang it and the ministers whose churches hosted it,
 
and after a couple of years developed it into his
 
dissertation topic.
 So far -
-
 so normal.  But he also worked
 
out with the practicing groups the following scheme:  a
 
recording was produced from his  field work that  followed t
-he
 
ir -
-mus ic
 a
 1 sessions but
 
included many of the active singers.  He applied for grant
 
money to produce both cassettes and CD's of the result,
 
distributing more than  600  casssettes to group members as
 
partial honoraria and more than 400 complimentary CDs to
 
archives,  historical  societies,  college libraries,  non-profit
 
radio stations etc.  in the area.  Publication of the recording
 
was heralded by a public symposium at which both academic and
 
religious  leaders  spoke and each of the 29  still active
 
musical groups  in the region were publicly awarded an
 
honorarium of $250.00 -
-
 the largest  single expense of the
 
project.  Future profits  (in terms of royalties which will
 
undoubtedly be microscopic)  are being placed in a trust  fund
 
for the Singing and Praying Bands,  as they call themselves,
 
three members of which have been elected as trustees along
 
with the director of the local museum and the project
 
director
 
It  is too early to tell the effect of this project upon
 
the music itself -
-
 like many another vivid and electrifying
 
music it  comes  from a non-standard doctrinal group whose
 
activities are often snubbed by more respectable uptown
 
churches,  and some disagreement over the
k increased
 
prominence of these nonconformists is to be expected.  But
 
overall the project  seems to me a model of responsible broad-
brush inclusive planning,  clearly and positively educational,
 
in the best  sense of the term.  The project director recently
 
received a letter written by the  son of two of the local
 
singers  (on stationery from the Wall Street  firm where he
 
works)
 
.in this age of Afro-centrism -
 or the adding of
 
value to the history of people of African descent-  (your)
 
work takes on increased importance.  No longer will my
 
forefathers be  looked at as wild beasts who are too ignorant
 
to know any better,  but as Africans who adopted Christianity
 
and brought their age-old,  traditional  style of worship to
 
this new faith and new land.  Be encouraged,  your work is
 
greatly appreciated.  .
 .
 .
 "
 Now that's a letter to get,
 
isn't  it?
 Good as an A any day.
 
I think there are hundreds of such potential projects
 
lying around just waiting for an energetic,  competent,
 
responsible,  patient  scholar to add his or her expertise to
 
the mix.  Don't worry;  you won't get  far if the musicians
 
themselves don't want to work with you or if the project
 
really doesn't  suit the folks.  And think of the high school
 
classes where you might be able to help present a Vietnamese
 
musician or a local  instrument maker,  the local comm unity
 
radio or t. v.  station where you could play your record
 
collection like Fred Lieberman did when he used to bill
 
himself as  "the world's first equal cultural opportunity disc
 
jockey".
 He would put on an Albanian record and then say,
 
"Hey,  is there anybody out there that's from Albania?
 Why
 
don't you bring your own records  in to the station and we'll
 
put them together with mine and have a whole program of this
 
great  stuff!"
 here are thousands of things to do.
 
And so I want to close with a challenge.  I have recently
 
 
 
from the National Endowment for the Arts,  a federal
 
granting agency charged with the  following mission:
 "to
 
foster the excellence,  diversity and vitality of the arts  in
 
the United States today and to help broaden the availability
 
and appreciation of such excellence,  diversity and vitality."
 
Did you know about that? Did you know that that language is
 
now part of the  law of our land.  It still gives me
 
F
 
goosebumps.  But there it  is and it d
.i f
i' *-1
 -
 We
 
didn't think about music or art  in that way.  But now we have
 
a clear statement codified into legalese and well expressed) 
and it  says that the work of the musician,  the dancer,  the
 
artist has  stature and is a proper matter of national
 
concern.  The arts are  right up there with housing and foreign
 
relations and commerce and national defense.
 
Of course they don't get much money.  The overall  funds
 
the National Endowment  for the Arts has to distribute in
 
terms of grants  is  in the neighborhood of 175 million,  give
 
or take a million or two.  That really is peanuts  in
 
Washington terms.  Butjthe other day I took the peanuts and
 
sorted them out  roughly and came up with some interesting
 
figures -
 large approximations,  of course.
 
Something over  60% of the  175 ,
M goes out directly to
 
fund arts projects and institutions rather than being given
 
out through state or regional or local arts agencies.  Of
 
that,  about 25% goes to various efforts to support what most
 
people call classical music -
-
 opera,  choral,  chamber,
 
symphonic  ,even  jazz -
-
 a figure of 17 or 18 million dollars.
 
The two Endowment programs that  fund all other kinds of music
 
(along with all other genres of traditional arts)  have
 
devoted at a generous  figure perhaps a third of their budgets
 
to funding music projects -
-
 together perhaps  $3 million
 
dollars.
 
So,  of the total number of dollars made available by the
 
Congress
 for nation-wide support of the arts,  approximately
 
14%  goes to the general area of music of which
 
12% goes to "classical" western European music leaving
 
2%  for all other musics including:  "American folk
 
music",  the classical musics of non-western European cultures
 
such indigenous  forms as the blues,  blue grass,
 
gospel,  corijunto,  salsa,  klezmer,  et al.
 
a
 
It's k4nd- of shocking,  isn't  it?
 When  I was working at
 
the EndowmentX for the last  five or six years  I used to feel
 
I was  swimming desperately in an indoor pool and that the
 
level of the water -
-
 the  level of demand -
-
 kept on
 rising
 
so that there was  less and less air between me and the
 
ceiling and no matter how hard I swam I couldn't push that
 
roof any higher.  I was  just  stuck.
 
And maybe  I was  right.  Let's  look around beyond the
 
range of government -
 government  is an awfully easy target,
 
as every day's newspaper shows.  Let's  look at our own
 
grounds.  Let's  look at academia.  How do the budgets
 
in or own home  institutions compare along this simple schema:
 
% of budget devoted to arts
 
% of that budget devoted to classical music  (including,
 
to be  fair,  music teacher training),
 
% of budget available  for other musics  (ethnomusicology)
 
I
'll take a bet  right here and now that the ratio between
 
classipal music instruction
 and ethnomusicology budgets  in
 
90% of universities  is no whit better than the federal
 
budget.
 Indeed,  I think that's why the federal budget  is and
 
bids  fair to stay so low -
-
 it reflects the situation we have
 
allowed to maintain across the country.  We have not made our
 
case.
 
I know many of you are weary from the endless  struggle
 
within your own separate institutions and I know that you
 
have valiantly raised the  issue of our European dominated
 
academics time and again.  But we must never stop.  We must
 
seek new sources of strength,  perhaps through alliances with
 
other groups both academic and lay.  Throughout this over-long
 
paper I have been emphasizing the changes that  I have seen
 
during this half-century.  The simple dyad of author/reader is
 
now only one way of communicating;  with recording and
 
television,  communication goes every which way,  the
 
conversation is enormously extended,  much to our mutual
 
benefit,  I believe,  and thus we may find ourselves able to
 
join hands with previously unsuspected allies -
 most
 
particularly the musicians themselves.  But there is much to
 
do.
 
At the  1992 Festival of the Pacific Arts  in Rarotonga in
 
the Cook  Islands there was a pre-festival conference that  I
 
was allowed to attend as observer.  One of the participants
 
was an elegant,  dignified and gentle-spoken senior woman from
 
American Samoa who spoke as  follows;  (this  is not verbatim,
 
buL
i e
 n t
 Tán
 ere is what  she said.)
 "I was
 
born and brought up in American Samoa,  but  I went to the
 
United States  for my advanced education,  and I am now back
 
home working as an educator in my turn.  During my
 
undergraduate and graduate career in several American
 
universities,  I took many art appreciation courses,  some in
 
visual and some  in the musical arts,  and I loved them.  But
 
now that  I am back home,  I realize that  I never once heard
 
any music other than European in any of my classes.  And now I
 
am president of the Community College in American Samoa,  the
 
only institution of higher education there,  an I hope someday
 
to be able to learn about the music of the Pacific Islands."

And I found myself d
y embarrassed and ashamed.  I
 
hardly knew where to  look,  especially since  I don't think
 
things are the  least bit better now than when she was
 
receiving her aesthetic "education"
 Think back to those
 
devastating budget  figures and this  in a time when "multi-
culturalism"  is the watchword and hardly anybody knows what
  
it means. Can't we grab that multi-cultural ball and do some
 
running with it?
 As an organization? As a discipline?
 
Suppose we took as a simple common purpose to see to it that
 
no American will ever again go through their education
 
without hearing  just one piece of music from a Pacific Island
 
-
-
 China -
-
 Africa -
-
 Alaska-- the other places of the world
 
we all live together in? Could we not work up a plan for that
 
to  send to Washington  (which is a very different place these
 
days)  so that nobody ever again can say what that  college
 
president  said.  I think a lot of people would like that and
 
support t4
.
 Couldn't we give  it a try?

and a southerner besides,  and I was a bit  intimidated by it
 
and by Charley,  truth to tell.  So I turned to his wife,  Ruth
 
Crawford Seeger,  I suppose because she was younger and a bit
 
more approachable.  And she was a wonderful mother besides,
 
and I got  in on  just a bit of that great mothering that  she
 
exuded from every pore.
 
I am sure that Charley would not take  it amiss  if  I
 
reminisce a bit more about Ruth,  for Ruth was a very
 
important  Seeger,  she was  indeed,  and I think that  somewhere
 
in the ultimate history of the Seeger lectures,  someone
 
should say so.
 At the time  I knew her in thelate 30's  she
 
was transcribing the music for "Our Singing Country"  from
 
father and Alan's  field recordings and-- with her left hind
 
foot and a certain amount of household help  (Elizabeth Cotton
 
was yet to come)  -
-
 she was also raising Michael,  Peggy and
 
Barbara  (Penny
 was yet to come too) .
 The three children were
 
aged somewhere around
 five and three and sort of minus one
 
if my memory is  correct.
 
One of my tasks at the time was to act  as  liaison
 
between my father and brother,  at their book and record
 
strewn desks  in the
 Library of Congress,
 and Ruth at her
 
home work-station in Silver Spring,  where she was all fitted
 
out with a record player with a massive sixteen inch
 
turntable  for the heavy field recordings plus a set of
 
earphones,  an artist's drafting table with T squares and
 
rulers and pots of Carters  India  Ink with which she created
 
her elegantly calligraphed musical scores.
 And then there
 
was a small desk with a few pencils,  a telephone,  and a
 
notebook in which she kept a tally of the number of times  she
 
listened to every single piece of music in the Our Singing
 
Country corpus.  Occasionally -
-
 as happens not  infrequently
 
in the imperfect art of transcribing songs -
-
 disagreements
 
would arise between the book authors and the musical editor
 
over particular texts  or even interpretations of evanescent
 
and tricky melodies,  and it was generally my responsibility
 
to transmit messages  from one camp of authorities to the
 
other.
 "Bess,  you tell Ruth that no blues  singer God ever
 
made would sing  'redder than rouge'  -
-
 it's  'redder than
 
ru(by)'  with a voice break in the middle-- that's why she
 
doesn't hear it  right."
 "Now,  Bess,  you go back and tell
 
Alan and your father that  I have  listened to this  song
 
exactly 78 times all the way through,  not mentioning single
 
verses.
 How many times have they listened to it? Get them to
 
tell me that."
 
It was quite an education,  and I was at the  same time
 
being allowed the opportunity to observe an extraordinarily
 
talented and gifted woman functionning in a multiplicity of
 
roles that must have been tearing her apart.
 At one point
 
that year all the children got whooping cough and had to stay
 
home from their day-care center and they played,  rolling
 
about  like so many puppies on the living room rug noisily but
 
pleasantly enough  ("Gentle voices,  gentle voices",  Ruth kept
 
singing to them),  until a whoop would start.  The victim would
 
trot docilely off to the bathroom to throw up and Ruth would
 
take off her earphones and go into the kitchen to make a
 
little restorative snack for the sufferer,  see to it that he
 
or she got  it down,  and then return to the 79th careful
 
listening to
 "Go Down,  You Old Red Rising Sun" or the  112th
 
to  "Bonaparte's Retreat Across the Rocky Mountains"
 
And then Charley would come home  from work -
 was  it then
 
the Writers Project or the Pan American Union? -
 and every-
thing would stop.  He would beam largely around upon us all
 
and give Barbara  (the crib baby)  a special flare of his hand,
 
a kind of starfish effect that  she would always return in
 
kind;  and then special hugs all round and a nice  settle-down
 
by the fireplace with  (generally)  Peggy on his knee.  The rest
 
of us  showed off for his attention,  but at heart the family
 
action always  really swirled around Ruth it  seemed to me.
 
Oh dear Ruth.
 She was  indeed so dear that the children
 
and even Charley called her "Deo".  She taught me a lot about
 
how to be a grown-up and a woman and for that  I will never
 
forget her,  but  she also taught me something else that  she
 
possibly wasn't aware of.  She taught me that professional,
 
academically trained,  avant garde,  politically radical,
 
totally up to the minute musicians  like Charles Seeger and
 
Ruth Crawford Seeger could and did stand in awe of the
 
musical achievements of old country ladies,  black stevedores,
 
Mexican field workers,  Ohio canal boat captains,  and all the
 
other amazing casts of characters my father and brother had
 
been for so long re-introducing to their own homeland
 
audiences.  I already sort of knew all this,  of course,  but  it
 
was Ruth who diagrammed out  for me how smoothly and
 
inevitably a 5/4 meter worked in a Cajun ballad,  how
 
rhythmically complex an apparently routine Kentucky fiddle
 
tune turned out to be,  how a meltingly liquid Alabama field
 
holler really defied standard music notation.  And so it was
 
through Ruth and Charles Seeger that  I began to realize that
 
the musics  I had heard most of
 my life on field recordings
 
were,  in their exceptional performances,  as totally excellent
 
as the exceptional performances of any other musical
 
tradition -
-
 even the Baroque,  even the Romantic.
 
For  I had been brought up as a classical pianist,  and
 
although I had heard field recordings all my life,  I found
 
myself following
 Charles and Ruth through their process of
 
discovery in dealing with my father's and brother's
 
recordings with  just a bit of their feelings of genuine
 
surprise.  The senior Seegers had listened widely to the
 
musics of Africa and the far East but,  like most musicians of
 
their day,  they had not heard the United States,  and thus
 
their entire musical training -
-
 sophisticated and wide-
ranging as  it was -
-
 had not prepared them for the sonorities
 
of north Georgia shape note hymn  singing or Mississippi
 
African American work choruses.  Hearing Ruth and Charles
 
Seeger professionally and seriously discussing the musical
 
qualities of field hollers and banjo tunes opened a door that
 
I hadn't known was closed,  and made me  literally face the
 
music.
 
For you see,  in the other part of my day,  I was being
 
trained by my father and my brother as a folklorist as well.
 
My particular responsibility at the time -
-
 and at the age of
 
15  it was a mind-boggling assignment,  especially since  it was
 
for real -
-
 was to help annotate the songs that were being
 
put  into "Our Singing Country":  that  is,  I was to search
 
through other collections of traditional songs and ballads  in
 
order to be able to cite parallel texts and tunes  from which
 
the history of individual  songs might one day be established.
 
I read through all the great  literary collections -
-
 Child,
 
Sharp,  Randolph,  Belden,  Frank C,  Brown -
-
 and I could see
 
what these great collectors were talking about:  there were
 
indeed songs -
 specific conjoined texts and tunes -
 that
 
seemed to move  independently,  infinitely flexible but  somehow
 
invariably recognizable no matter in what guise they turned
 
up.
 
For even the world of music was  in many ways  confined to
 
print  in those days,  and it was because of the
 
unchallengeable authority of the printing press that we were
 
still laboring almost exclusively with concepts from the pre-
electronic past although my own father and brother were major
 
leaders  in using the new and developing electronic capacities
 
to capture the actual act of musical performance.
 
But  certainly
 most  folk music lovers  of the 30's and
 
40's  still thought that  it was  "the song"-- an intact package
 
P

of
 and one or two particular tunes -
-
 that really
 
mattered,  so that we constantly hunted for "good ones" that
 
could encircle the globe and bring us all together and solve
 
all manner of problems and make us brave and fearless and
 
educate us to our beautiful differences.  And so we happily
 
chased songs around the countryside and when we caught one we
 
thought nothing of writing
 a simplified version of it down
 
and publishing it and fixing it up in ways that would make it
 
especially appealing to one kind of taste or another and
 
teaching it to all manner of other people.  And that was a
 
good thing to do;  all of us have grown in wisdom and humanity

And throughout history,  most people had thought that
 
folk and traditional musics existed V mmdn W
.
 to entertain the
 
masses and to inspire,  feed and nourish the higher musical
 
arts .4M@mq
M A lot of people still think so.  When I was a
 
teen-ager working at the Library of Congress,  such eminent
 
composers as Aaron Copland and Virgil Thompson came in
 
looking for some interesting musical folk idioms but most
 
particularly for some solid and long-lasting melodies  for use
 
in their symphonic compositions.  And I helped find the  field
 
recordings that they listened to and later put to extensive
 
use.  Shoot,  Charles Seeger himself composed a symphonic
 
variation that wove together 7 or 8 of the many elegant
 
melodies  folks had developed for a single romantic ballad,
 
"John Riley".  (It was years  later that  I heard Leonard
 
Bernstein say that he thought the hardest single part of
 
musical composition was to latch on to a really good and
 
memorable tune.)  No wonder American composers were interested
 
to find an archive  full of them!
 
So the composers  sat  in the Archive of American Folksong
 
jotting down the tunes of the songs they heard,  and
 
professional copyists  copied down any transcribed tunes they
 
could find so that music publishers could copyright them,  and
 
the people who wanted to learn songs or teach them to
 
children in school looked inside  folk song books  for sources
 
of material,  and folklorists spent months and years chasing
 
down the original author/composer of particular songs
 
believing sincerely that when they had found that out,  they
 
would know the single thing that was the most important to
 
know about them.  Remember,  every song was a thing and things
 
have makers and copiers and owners and big money-making
 
industries can be built around them, and were.  But the
 
recording machine -
-
 well,  that took the song out of the book
 
and the library and the printing press  and brought  it to life
 
as an event  in time and space.
 
But each time a song was recorded it was a new event and
 
these things multiplied and pretty soon each song was kind of
 
a conglomeration of multiple events complete with multiple
 
variations and after a while what on earth was it you were
 
dealing with?
 I remember hearing Charles Seeger say once
 
that the only truly unchangeable and therefore copyrightable
 
thing about a piece of music was the pattern of the grooves
 
cut  into a record.  And now we don't even have grooves any
 
more and we are  still dealing with the challenging
 effects
 
of this revolutionary shift of emphasis  from print to sound,
 
And of course many people  from McLuhan on have commented on
 
this but perhaps not  from the perspective  I saw it as  it was
 
happening.
 
It  always was a struggle.  For the early recordists to do
 
their field work,  it was not only an intellectual and social
 
struggle but a downright physical one as well.  Even after the
 
period of the cyllinder and the fearsome horn into which only
 
the RCA dog seemed able to sing with any pleasure,  came the
 
enormous back-breaking "portable" recording machines,  each
 
one run off of 4 to  6 automobile batteries,  and served by
 
weighty boxes of  16 inch discs.  At one point  in the 40s when
 
Father took the daring step of buying a brand new Ford to
 
take him just once more through the southern backwoods,  he
 
had the garage rip out the whole back seat and install a
 
built-in platform with a special  set of shock absorbers to
 
accomodate the burden.
 And I will  spare you my views of the
 
horrors of the  subsequent wire recorders,  their huge tangled
 
spools eyed grimly by the most dauntless of
 L.C.  sound
 
engineers.
 
But  other major consequences kept on rippling out  from
 
the  central disturbance -
-
 for example the specific singer of
 
a song,  typically recognized in print by a simple  footnote,
 
became  in recordings a person of prominence and importance,
 
"a performing artist".  Indeed in popular music,  the name of
 
the artist came to be  far more commercially valuable than the
 
name of the song,  and recording contracts were proof of that,
 
even saving royalty money by requiring singers to compose
 
their own songs  since nobody much cared about what song they
 
were singing anyway.  (
Parenthetically,  this  I believe
 
accounts at  least to a degree for the massive decline in
 
quality of the American popular song in recent years;  there
 
are  lots more good song singers than song writers.)
 
Another major change was the enormous  increase in the
 
availability for the general listener of both local American
 
and worldwide musics.  Only fifty years ago -
-
 say in 1943,
 
you could not listen seriously to African-American work song
 
singers or Mexican-American corridistas or Anglo-American
 
shape note congregations unless you travelled to the place
 
where they were actually making the music or visited the
 
Archive of American Folk Songs at the Library of Congress or
 
the Sound Archives at the University of Indiana.  There were
 
some spasmodic commercial recordings but basically it was
 
these somewhat daunting academic archives that held in trust
 
the voices of the varied people 
of the United States -
-
 the
 
non-standard,  specialized,  quirky,  powerful,  angry,  hopeful
 
people who had broken free  from the second-handedness of
 
print and allowed their especial musical talents,  their
 
especial musical visions,  and their own private voices to be
 
recorded for the benefit of -
-
 God knows who they thought.
 
I recently listened to some old field recordings my
 
father made and every time he recorded a tune he said,  "This
 
song was  sung by Mister so and so of such and such a town
 
recording on thus and such a date for the Library of Congress
 
in Washington." He made it  sound so important.  Maybe they
 
thought the Congress was going to listen to them -
-
 or maybe
 
President Roosevelt.  Maybe,  in a way,  that's kind of what did
 
happen;  things  certainly aren't the same as they used to be.
 
For whenever  I like  I can now listen to the major
 
repertoires of hundreds of different world-wide cultures and
 
almost every small group in every state in the union. (
If I
 
had my brother's magical "Global Jukebox" at my personal
 
disposal,  I could not only triple or quadruple this
 
repertoire but vastly enhance with critically important
 
ethnographic information and film the musics available to me
 
at a fingertip) .
 And all this richness  is right there for
 
anybody --awkward to get hold of maybe
 and costly,  but  still
 
it  is there and it usen't to be there.  It couldn't be got
 
hold of before.  Thanks to the prevailing recording machine,
 
these musics are no longer within the private purview of the
 
people who happen to live  in a particular part of the world,
 
or the people who have troubled to go to that part of the
 
world,  or the people who have announced themselves to be
 
world music students  and scholars.
 
And this  is a brand new state of affairs.  The nature,
 
significance and responsibilities of the work of folklore and
 
ethnomusicology have changed forever.  Nothing is a simple
 
one-way street anymore.  Everything works differently in
 
imponderable and disconcerting ways.  A couple of years ago
 a
 
Boston friend told me a story about a Masssachusetts  student
 
of African music who had climaxed his  studies by spending
 
several years  in a particular African nation as a disciple of
 
a particular master tribal drummer.  Upon his  return to the
 
United States,  the young student determined to try to
 
recreate  in all  its glory the marvellous music he had tried
 
to learn,  and in the process he transformed himself into a
 
one-man band,  attaching pulleys and levers to his body
 
through which he could sound the bell pattern with his  right
 
hand while he led the mama drum with his left  foot and
 
handled the shakers by nodding his head and so forth.  It was
 
an enormously complex venture and he was  legitimately proud
 
when he could finally bring it all off,  cross rhythms and
 
all.  And then
 he heard that his old teacher from Africa was
 
coming to town with a visiting troupe.  He delightedly made an
 
appointment to see him at his hotel,  he arrayed himself for a
 
triumphal performance and he played his heart out.  And his
 
teacher looked at him affectionately and remarked,  "Oh,  you
 
poor fellow.  Don't you have any friends?"
 
Here we  see African musical  standards being applied to
 
European musical tactics and what are we to make of that?
 
The communicative dyad is more of a triad or a quartet or
 
chorus these days,  and folklorists and ethnomusicologists are
 
no longer lonely explorers  into uncharted areas  (if ever we
 
were) .
 Nowadays we are engaged in continual conversations
 
with everybody -
-
 musicians,  educators,  deans,  concert
 
promoters,  singers,  radio producers,  griots,  record company
 
executives,  community activists,  politicians,  reporters,
 
students,  and the Lord knows who all.  The one man band is out
 
for us.
 
Folklorists are perhaps a bit more used to this,  since
 
their work though generally distributed in print has used the
 
alphabet  rather than specialized notation methods and has
 
always emphasized the English language.  And as general
 
literacy became the norm folklorists'  so-called informants
 
could and did read the books  in which their material was
 
printed and they were duly critical of the results,  all the
 
way from how the book royalties were handled,  down to the
 
iconography -
-
 "It's neither right  spelt nor right  setten'
 
down" as  an irate  lady remarked to Sir Walter Scott on one
 
historic occasion.
 
So none of us who consider ourselves  scholars,  lovers,
 
savants,  of music any longer work alone if ever we did.  But
 
neither are we  irrelevant.  In fact  I believe that the work of
 
the afficionado,  the dedicated student and the deep lover of
 
particular art  forms  (from inside and outside the culture)
 
may become ever more  important and ever more crucial as time
 
goes by.  One of the more troubling assumptions of our period
 
is that any member of any group by simple virtue of that
 
membership
 has an inborn and unmatchable intellectual tie
 
with its  cultural manifestations.  Not  so.  It would be so nice
 
if it were that  simple,  but many -
 possibly even most -
 
people both of the majority and of smaller groups are simply
 
not  interested.  They have chosen to focus their efforts upon
 
other fields,  and that  is well.  We don't need everyone to be
 
a cultural authority.  But we do need some,  and it  is plain
 
that the kind of perspective essential to the understanding
 
of any art  form is developed through intense,  disciplined and
 
comparative study,  no matter if the student  is an insider or
 
an outsider of the particular culture.  For both it represents
 
hard self-dedicated work and attentiveness,  the kind of
 
strict professional attention I saw Ruth and Charles Seeger
 
devoting to my father's and brother's  field recordings.
 
But what,  in another  fifty years,  will be there be for
 
us  insiders or outsiders,  or our insider and outsider grand-
children,  to study? When I look at a record or a tape or a
 
c. d.  these days and note the date when the recording was
 
actually made,  I begin to wonder.  They were all made so long
 
ago.  Even the new ones tend to be re-releases.  In fact,  when
 
I talk to young people today about how they should be doing
 
field work,  especially
 recording,  they tell me gently that
 
all that kind of thing has already been done.  And I laugh,
 
but then could it really be true? Can it really be that the
 
peoples of the world are abandoning their own glorious
 
historical musical achievements  in order that their young
 
people can grab a few dimes off of today's amplified pop
 
music merry-go-round? Or letting their music go on the cheap
 
so that  somebod krom
 the popular music world or any other
 
musical world can fix it up the way can fix it up the way
 
they would like to hear it? We ought to be beyond that by
 
now.
 
Way back  in the  fall of  1975  I attended my first  SEN
 
meeting with the idea of telling the membership that during
 
the  summer of 1976 a marvellous event was to take place  in
 
Washington,  D.C.  -
-
 a summer-long Festival of American Folk
 
Life during which traditional artists  from across the United
 
States would conjoin with traditional artists from their
 
original country or tribe.  At the least,  I said in my naive
 
enthusiasm,  exciting previously unheard musicians would be
 
appearing on the Mall
 and at the best,  some significant
 
interchanges between old and new world musicians might occur
 
that might  lead to some re-invigoration of marginal musics.
 
I was quite unprepared for the general  lack of
 
enthusiasm my report  received.  I was gently informed by one
 
responding speaker that the events  I was projecting
 were
 
only of marginal interest to the Society,  that festivals were
 
purely temporal events of no long-term consequence,  that the
 
true function of ethnomusicology was to record reality -
 -
 
in this period,  the  inevitable gradual decline of local
 
musics under the onslaught of national popular musics.  Jeez.
 
How bleak.  How unappealing.  Surely the whole discipline,  I
 
thought,  can't approve.  I mean,  who wants to be someone who
 
only gets to take notes on the relative rate of decay of
 
something?
 Maybe  I didn't get  it right.
 
And of course  I hadn't.  Many ethnomusicologists
 
contributed to,  learned from,  and delighted in that vast
 
summer spectacle.  I had many chances to talk with them,  and I
 
came to realize that many had truly deep concerns about the
 
appropriateness of their participation in such events.  Their
 
training had been that  scholars  should always remain separate
 
from the topic they study and that they must  in every way
 
attempt not to influence the course of its development.  This
 
is,  if nothing else,  a position that grants a genuine dignity
 
to both parties  involved -
-
 the  students and the  studied.  But
 
others had other points of view.
 
For one thing it  is plain to many that  culture never is
 
just a popularity contest with winner take all.  Within any
 
ongoing population there will always be several active
 
artistic traditions -
-
 old-timey,  new-fangled,  idiosyncratic,
 
original,  imitative,  archaic -
-
 all concurrent,  all  jostling
 
for place and a piece of the action,  all lively and
 
meaningful.  Different  forces within and outside the culture
 
support and further different choices within this menu.
 
Personally,  I tend to find that  I am an unregenerate and
 
moldy fig,  and I invariably announce that point of view early
 
on in a new situation so that  it  can be taken into account as
 
I rave on.
 And nobody seems to mind that much.
 
But  I think some of us  feel that  it  is  somehow unfair
 
for scholars and savants to express anything but total
 
neutrality in such ongoing cultural struggles.  Aside from
 
neutrality's making for awfully boring conversations, Iwould
 
like to comment gently I think this position over-estimates
 
the actual weight and importance of our opinions.  At the Folk
 
Arts Program in the Arts Endowment we  found out quickly the
 
limits of outsider views -
 even those that are backed by
 
grants money -
 for although our scholarly panel might vote
 
not to fund a project,  the local  folks very often went right
 
on ahead and did it anyway.  And I have to say that gave me a
 
lot of confidence  in the good sense of everyone concerned -
-
the panel and the  folks.
 
In the  short term,then,  it  is
 rare for scholars and
 
savants to wield coercive power.  Our contributions tend to
 
work towards slanting,  mediating,  highlighting,  pointing
 
things out,  maybe mushing them up -
-
 but generally we serve
 
inter-connecting functions.  So most of the time we needn't
 
worry that our pronouncements are going to directly change
 
anything in particular or that we will do anything
 
catastrophic by publicly expressing our delight  in,  concern
 
for,  or worries about  such phenomena as  local musical
 
traditions and artists.
 
Besides,  we have an obligation to do as well as we can
 
just whatever it is that we do.  Ethnomusicologists are
 
important parts of human society and we are  supposed to be in
 
there pitching.  If we weren't there,  we would have to be
 
invented,  for music is  important.In the NEA Folk Arts Program
 
Dan Sheehy,  Terry Liu,  Barry Bergey,  a host of collaborators
 
and I have had that proven to us over and over again as we
 
watched a fifteen year spectacle of musical  situations
 
develop,  misfire,  subside,  explode and thrive. And we learned
 
that every form of music is  i mportant  for somebody no matter
 
how micro the music or the population.
 Music is the ultimate
 
morale builder;  its absence is always associated with
 
listlessness and anomie.  Ethnomusicologists all really know
 
this,  and when they ask me what they can do to help the
 
musics of the world flourish in the strange times we live in,
 
I tell them -
-
 lots of things -
-
 most of them very simple,
 
all of them quite consonant with their academic and scholarly
 
responsibilities:
 
For one thing,  every ethnomusicologist  can devote energy
 
to the performance of the  simple straightforward Ruth Seeger
 
manouvre,  continually and publicly pointing out the
 
complexity and interest of the musical  forms that  surround us
 
in the world.  It's a truism that all teaching doesn't have to
 
take place  in a classroom,  but we need to look actively for
 
more opportunities to make what we know more widely available
 
especially to the musicians themselves who often need the
 
language and data that will help them defend their own
 
musics.  My friend David Roche  (who is calling an organizing
 
meeting at  9:00 a. m.  Sunday morning for a new SEM standing
 
committee on public music -
-
 plug)  has  invented a brand new
 
way of teaching within a festival -
 calling for
 "pop-up
 
presenters",  people
 who will wander around im  crowds
 
starting conversations about the performances,  drawing
 
attention to their technical complexity,  their originality,
 
showing people how to listen.  That's teaching.
 
And then,  every ethnomusicologist can  look carefully
 
about the place where he is-- not where she might  like to be
 
-
-
 noting the kind of people who live there,  finding out what
 
their musical state of life is,  assessing the vitality and
 
the artistry that  lives or droops or thrives  in the
 
surrounding community.  Always remember that the United States
 
is the end point of most of the recent mass human migrations
 
and we therefore willy-nilly host many world-level artists
 
here.  Many of them are in fine shape,  but far too many are
 
disconnected,  despondent,  out of practice,  embarrassed,
 
angry,  desperately in need of an interpreter,  a mentor,  some
 
help in cracking through to audiences  in this new land.
 
I find the number of ethnomusicologists who have no
 
knowledge of or connection with the musical  life of the place
 
where they live most troubling.  And it's an interesting
 
contrast with folklorists who have a strong tendency to work
 
within their own geographic area,  while ethnomusicologists
 
really seem to want to go far afield.  It's noticeable even in
 
the classroom;  an ethmomusicologist  is  far more likely to
 
bring to class a visiting
 Chinese musician than a local
 
blues guitarist while a folklorist will take  just the
 
opposite tack.  Perhaps we  should  join  forces,  but  since  I
' m
 
talking to ethnomusicologists today,  I will urge you to look
 
with greater care into your own local musical community
 
resources.  Musicians,  after all,  need to be employed.  If they
 
don't get  jobs,  they stop being musicians and do something
 
else.  It's as  simple as that;  if you want musicians to
 
thrive,  get them some work.
 
And then every ethnomusicologist  can and should function
 
as a critic.  Maintenance of standards  is absolutely essential
 
to the health of any art  form.  It  is easy enough for a
 
production of "Oklahoma" or even "Carmen" to get a sensible
 
and informed response  from a general audience along with some
 
good ideas  in next day's newspaper reviews  for the
 
improvement of future performances.  This is not the case for
 
the multi-cultural festivals,  for the  "visiting national
 
troupe from the Caucasus" or for the local Chinese opera
 
production.  All these efforts deserve and could benefit
 
enormously from carefully thought out, engaging and well-
informed
 professional response.  This may require  some of us
 
to do some extra homework;  well,that's  invigorating,isn't  it?
 
And finally,  every ethnomusicologist  should take on the
 
responsibility of developing some minimal degree of practical
 
entrepreneurship,  learning how to make our special musics
 
broadly accessible.  There are so many ways to do this -
-
 good
 
solid academic ways.
 
I recently read a report  from a folklorist who became
 
fascinated with a particular African American religious  song
 
tradition practiced in rural areas around his host
 
university.
 He  followed it  from little church to little
 
church,  mapped out  its provenience,  made friends with the
 
folks who sang it and the ministers whose churches hosted it,
 
and after a couple of years developed it into his
 
dissertation topic.
 So far -
-
 so normal.  But he also worked
 
out with the practicing groups the following scheme:  a
 
recording was produced from his  field work that  followed the
 
traditional course of one of their musical sessions but
 
included many of the active singers.  He applied for grant
 
money to produce both cassettes and CD's of the result,
 
distributing more than  600 casssettes to group members as
 
partial honoraria and more than 400 complimentary CDs to
 
archives,  historical  societies,  college libraries,  non-profit
 
radio stations etc.  in the area.  Publication of the recording
 
was heralded by a public symposium at which both academic and
 
religious  leaders  spoke and each of the 29 still active
 
musical groups  in the region were publicly awarded an
 
honorarium of $250.00 -
-
 the largest single expense of the
 
project.  Future profits  (in
 
undoubtedly be microscopic)
 
for the Singing and Praying
 
three members of which have
 
terms of royalties which will
 
are being placed in a trust  fund
 
Bands,  as they call themselves,
 
been elected as trustees along
 
with the director of the local museum and the project
 
director
 
It  is too early to tell the effect of this project upon
 
the music itself -
-
 like many another vivid and electrifying
 
music it  comes  from a non-standard doctrinal group whose
 
activities are often snubbed by more respectable uptown
 
churches,  and some disagreement over their increased
 
prominence of these nonconformists  is to be expected.  But
 
overall the project  seems to me a model of responsible broad-
brush inclusive planning,  clearly and positively educational,
 
in the best  sense of the term.  The project director recently
 
received a letter written by the  son of two of the local
 
singers  (on stationery from the Wall Street  firm where he
 
works)
 
in this age of Afro-centrism -
 or the adding of
 
value to the history of people of African descent-  (your)
 
work takes on increased importance.  No longer will my
 
forefathers be  looked at as wild beasts who are too ignorant
 
to know any better,  but as Africans who adopted Christianity
 
and brought their age-old,  traditional  style of worship to
 
this new faith and new land.  Be encouraged,  your work is
 
greatly appreciated.
 .
 "
 Now that's a letter to get,
 
isn't  it?
 Good as an A any day.
 
I think there are hundreds of such potential projects
 
lying around just waiting for an energetic,  competent,
 
responsible,  patient  scholar to add his or her expertise to
 
the mix.  Don't worry;  you won't get  far if the musicians
 
themselves don't want to work with you or if the project
 
really doesn't  suit the folks.  And think of the high school
 
classes where you might be able to help present a Vietnamese
 
musician or a local  instrument maker,  the local community
 
radio or t. v.  station where you could play your record
 
collection like Fred Lieberman did when he used to bill
 
himself as  "the world's  first equal cultural opportunity disc
 
jockey".
 He would put on an Albanian record and then say,
 
"Hey,  is there anybody out there that's from Albania?
 Why
 
don't you bring your own records  in to the station and we'll
 
put them together with mine and have a whole program of this
 
great  stuff!"
 Oh,  there are thousands of things to do.
 
And so  I want to close with a challenge.  I have recently
 
resigned from the National Endowment  for the Arts,  a federal
 
granting agency charged with the  following mission:
 "to
 
foster the excellence,  diversity and vitality of the arts  in
 
the United States today and to help broaden the availability
 
and appreciation of such excellence,  diversity and vitality."
 
Did you know about that? Did you know that that  language is
 
now part of the  law of our land! It  still gives me
 
goosebumps.  But there  it  is and it didn't use to be.
 We
 
didn't think about music or art  in that way.  But now we have
 
a clear statement codified into legalese and well expressed
 
and it  says that the work of the musician,  the dancer,  the
 
artist has  stature and is  a proper matter of national
 
concern.  The arts are right up there with housing and foreign
 
relations and commerce and national defense.
 
Of course they don't get much money.  The overall  funds
 
the National Endowment  for the Arts has to distribute in
 
terms of grants  is  in the neighborhood of 175 million,  give
 
or take a million or two.  That really is peanuts  in
 
Washington terms.  But\ he other day I took the peanuts and
 
sorted them out  roughly and came up with some  interesting
 
figures -
 large approximations,  of course.
 
Something over  60% of the  175 M goes out directly to
 
fund arts projects and institutions rather than being given
 
out through state or regional or local arts agencies.  Of
 
that,  about 25% goes to various efforts to support what most
 
people call classical music -
-
 opera,  choral,  chamber,
 
symphonic  ,even  jazz -
-
 a figure of 17 or 18 million dollars.
 
The two Endowment programs that  fund all other kinds of music
 
(along with all other genres of traditional arts)  have
 
devoted at a generous  figure perhaps a third of their budgets
 
to funding music projects -
-
 together perhaps  $3 million
 
dollars.
 
So,  of the total number of dollars made available by the
 
Congress
 for nation-wide  support of the arts,  approximately
 
14% goes to the general area of music of which
 
12% goes to "classical" western European music leaving
 
2%  for all other musics including:  "American folk
 
music",  the classical musics of non-western European cultures
 
as well as  such indigenous  forms as the blues,  blue grass,
 
gospel,  conjunto,  salsa,  klezmer,  et al.
 
It' s kind of shocking,  isn' t  it?
 When  I was working at
 
the Endowment,  for the last  five or six years  I used to feel
 
I was  swimming desperately in an indoor pool and that the
 
level of the water -
-
 the  level of demand -
-
 kept  on
 rising
 
so that there was  less and less air between me and the
 
ceiling and no matter how hard I swam I couldn't push that
 
roof any higher.  I was  just  stuck.
 
And maybe  I was  right.  Let's  look around beyond the
 
range of government -
 government  is an awfully easy target,
 
as every day's newspaper shows.  Let's  look at our own
 
stamping grounds.  Let's  look at academia.  How do the budgets
 
in mr 
0
own
 home  institutions compare along this  simple schema:
 
% of budget devoted to arts
 
% of that budget devoted to classical music  (including,
 
to be  fair,  music teacher training),
 
% of budget available  for other musics  (ethnomusicology)
 
I
' ll take a bet  right here and now that the ratio between
 
classical music instruction
 and ethnomusicology budgets  in
 
90% of universities  is no whit better than the federal
 
budget.
 Indeed,  I think that's why the federal budget  is and
 
bids  fair to stay so low -
-
 it reflects the situation we have
 
allowed to maintain across the country.  We have not made our
 
case.
 
I know many of you are weary from the endless struggle
 
within your own separate institutions and I know that you
 
have valiantly raised the  issue of our European dominated
 
academics time and again.  But we must never stop.  We must
 
seek new sources of strength,  perhaps through alliances with
 
other groups both academic and lay.  Throughout this over-long
 
paper I have been emphasizing the changes that  I have seen
 
during this half-century.  The simple dyad of author/reader is
 
now only one way of communicating;  with recording and
 
television,  communication goes every which way,  the
 
conversation is enormously extended,  much to our mutual
 
benefit,  I believe,  and thus we may find ourselves able to
 
join hands with previously unsuspected allies -
 most
 
particularly the musicians themselves.  But there  is much to
 
do.
 
SEN LECTURE -
-
 2/18/94  revision for ETHNOMUSICOLOGY..
 
I am truly honored to have been invited to give this
 
year's Seeger lecture,  though I fear it will be less of a
 
lecture than a pastiche of reminiscences,  observations and
 
exhortations.  I will begin by remarking that,  even in the
 
throes of the most passionate exhortation,  I continue to like
 
and admire ethnomusicologists.  This  is partly because they
 
tend to be such interesting people,  and partly because  I know
 
of few other academic disciplines that are both so tolerant
 
and so self-assured as to allow and even encourage the
 
participation of outriders  like myself.  Such serenity in the
 
face of diversity possibly derives  in part  from the fact that
 
one of the Society's early founders,  Charles Seeger,  was
 
himself more than a bit of an outrider.  Overall,  one could
 
describe him as a scholar of music;  he was also a composer,
 
an arranger,  an editor,  an educator,  a statesman,  a
 
bureaucrat,  and he worked a great deal  in matters to do with
 
how music might properly and effectively be  included in the
 
purview of government,  and how music might  itself affect the
 
course of government.
 
Actually,  it's hard to think of a single aspect of the
 
world of music that Charles Seeger didn't at  least express an
 
opinion about.  I first met him in Washington D.C.  when  I was
 
15,  brought up from Texas by my father John A.  Lomax,  to help
 
with a new book manuscript which was to be co-authored with
 
my brother,  Alan,  and published under the title of Our
  
Singing Country. It was my first big trip into the bigger
 
world and my father's distinguished friend,  Charles Seeger,
 
seemed at that time  immensely old and immensely
 
knowledgeable.  There didn't  seem to be anything that he
 
didn't know,  and he was  so sharp-minded and precise and sure.
 
That whole elegant cool New England intellectual  style was
 
completely new to me as a youngster and a southerner besides;
 
and I was a bit  intimidated by it and by Charley,  truth to
 
tell.  So  I turned to his wife,  Ruth Crawford Seeger,  I
 
suppose because  she was younger and a bit more approachable.
 
And she was a wonderful mother besides,  and I got  in on  just
 
a bit of the great mothering that  she exuded from every pore.
 
I am sure that  Charley would not take it amiss  if  I
 
reminisce a bit about Ruth,  for Ruth was a very important
 
Seeger,  and I think that  somewhere in the ultimate history of
 
the Seeger lectures,  someone should say so.  At the time  I
 
knew her  in the  late 30's  she was transcribing the music for
 
Our Singing Country from my father's and Alan's  field
 
recordings and -
-
 with her left hind foot and a certain
 
amount of household help  (Elizabeth Cotton was yet to come) --
she was also raising Michael,  Peggy and Barbara  (Penny
 was
 
yet to come too) .
 The three children were aged somewhere
 
around five and three and sort of minus one  if my memory is
 
correct.
 
One of my tasks at the time was to act as liaison
 
between my father and brother,  at their book and record
 
strewn desks  in the
 Library of Congress,  and Ruth at her
 
home workstation in Silver Spring,  where she was all fitted
 
out with ear phones,  a record player with a massive sixteen
 
inch turntable  for the heavy field recordings,  and an
 
artist's drafting table with T squares and rulers and pots of
 
coal-black Higgins  India Ink with which she created her
 
elegantly calligraphed musical scores.  And there was also a
 
small desk with a few pencils,  a telephone,  and a notebook in
 
which she kept a tally of the number of times she  listened to
 
every single piece of music in the Our Singing Country
  
corpus.  Occasionally -
-
 as happens not  infrequently in the
 
imperfect art of transcribing songs -
-
 disagreements would
 
arise between the book authors and the musical editor over
 
the  interpretation of evanescent and tricky melodies or
 
particularly difficult texts,  and it was generally my
 
responsibility to transmit messages  from one camp of
 
authorities to the other.
 
"Bess,  you tell Ruth that no blues  singer God ever made
 
would sing  'redder than rouge'  -
-
 it's  'redder than ru(by)'
 
with a voice break in the middle -
-
 that's why she doesn't
 
hear it right."
 "Now,  Bess,  you go back and tell Alan and
 
your father that  I have listened to this  song exactly 78
 
times all the way through,  not mentioning single verses.
 How
 
many times have they listened to it? Get them to figure that
 
out."
 
It was quite an education,  and I was at the  same time
 
being allowed the opportunity to observe an extraordinarily
 
talented and spirited woman functionning in a multiplicity of
 
roles that must have been tearing her apart.  At one point
 
that year all three children got whooping cough and had to
 
stay home  from their day-care center.  But they had each other
 
to play with,  rolling about  like  so many puppies on the
 
living room rug noisily but pleasantly enough  (
"Gentle
 
voices,  gentle voices," Ruth kept singing to them),  until a
 
whoop would start.  The victim would trot docilely off to the
 
bathroom to throw up and Ruth would take off her earphones
 
and go into the kitchen to make a little restorative snack
 
for the sufferer,  see to it that he or she got  it down,  and
 
then return to the 79th careful  listening to
 "Go Down,  You
 
Old Red Rising Sun" or the  112th to "Bonaparte's Retreat
 
Across the Rocky Mountains."
 
And then Charley would come home from work -
 was  it then
 
the Writers Project or the Pan American Union? -
 and every-
thing would stop.  He would beam largely around upon us all
 
and give Barbara  (
the crib baby)  a special flare of his hand,
 
a kind of  starfish effect that  she would always  return in
 
.

by the  fireplace with  (generally)  Peggy on his knee.  The rest
 
of us  showed off for his attention,  but at heart the family
 
action always really swirled around Ruth,  or so it  seemed to
 
me then.
 
Oh dear Ruth.  She was  indeed so dear that the children
 
and even Charley called her "Dec." She taught me a lot about
 
how to be a grown-up and a woman and for that  I will never
 
forget her,  but  she also taught me something else that  she
 
possibly wasn't aware of.  She taught me that professional,
 
academically trained,  avant garde,  politically radical,
 
totally up-to-the-minute musicians  like Charles Seeger and
 
Ruth Crawford Seeger could and did stand in awe of the
 
musical achievements of old country ladies,  black stevedores,
 
Mexican field workers,  Ohio canal boat  captains,  and all the
 
other amazing casts of characters my father and brother had
 
been for so long re-introducing to their own homeland
 
audiences.  I already sort of knew all this,  of course,  but  it
 
was Ruth who diagra
med out  for me the musical qualities  I
 
had been hearing -
-
 how smoothly and inevitably a 5/4 meter
 
worked in a Cajun ballad,  how rhythmically complex an
 
apparently routine Kentucky fiddle tune turned out to be,  how
 
a meltingly liquid Alabama field holler really defied
 
standard music notation.  And so it was through Ruth and
 
Charles Seeger that  I began to realize that the musics  I had
 
heard most of my life on field recordings were,  in their
 
exceptional performances,  as totally excellent as the
 
exceptional performances of any other musical tradition -
-
even the Baroque,  even the Romantic.
 
I myself had been brought up as a classical pianist,  and
 
although I had heard field recordings all my life,  I found
 
myself following Charles and Ruth through their own process
 
of discovery in dealing with my father's and brother's
 
recordings with  just a bit of their feelings of genuine
 
surprise.  The senior Seegers had listened widely to the
 
musics of Africa and the far East,  but,  like most musicians
 
of their day,  they had not  listened similarly to the United
 
States,  and thus their entire musical training -
-
sophisticated and wide-ranging as  it was -
-
 had not prepared
 
them for the sonorities of north Georgia shape note hymn
 
singing or Mississippi African American work choruses.
 
Hearing Ruth and Charles Seeger professionally and seriously
 
discussing the musical qualities of field hollers and banjo
 
tunes opened a door that  I hadn't known was closed,  and made
 
me  literally face the music.
 
For in the other part of my day,  I was being trained by
 
my father and my brother as a folklorist as well.  My
 
particular responsibility at the time -
-
 and at the age of 15
 
it was a mind-boggling assignment,  especially since it was
 
for real -
-
 was to help annotate the songs that were beirq
 
put  into Our Singing Country: that  is,  I was to search
 
through other collections of traditional  songs and ballads  in
 
order to be able to cite parallel texts and tunes  from which
 
the history of individual  songs might one day be established.
 
I read through all the great  literary collections -
-
 Child,
 
Sharp,  Randolph,  Belden,  Frank C.  Brown -
-
 and I could see
 
what these great collectors,  including the Lomaxes,  were
 
talking about:  there were  indeed songs -
 specific conjoined
 
texts and tunes -
 that  seemed to move  independently as units,
 
infinitely flexible but  somehow invariably recognizable no
 
matter in what guise they appeared.
 
Even the world of music was  in large part confined to
 
print  in those days.  And it was because of the
 
unchallengeable authority of the printing press that we were
 
still  laboring almost exclusively with concepts and
 
procedures  from the pre-electronic past,  although my own
 
father and brother were major leaders  in using the new and
 
developing electronic capacities to capture the actual act of
 
musical performance.
 
Most  folk music lovers of the 30's and 40's believed
 
that  it was  "the song"-- an intact package of words and a
 
particular tune -
-
 that  really mattered,  so that the primary
 
job was to try to find the  "good ones" that  could encircle
 
the globe and make plain our own history and bring us all
 
togetherand make us brave and wise.  And so we happily chased
 
songs around the countryside,  and when we caught one those of
 
us who were comparative musicologists worked to get  it down
 
on paper accurately,  preparing research articles  for
 
scholarly  journals and technical transcriptions of entire
 
performances.  Others worked to share our song findings with
 
the general public,  preparing easier-to-read versions of the
 
tunes and fixing them up so that they might be remembered by
 
all manner of other people.  And those were all good things to
 
do in that complex and transitory period.  All of us have
 
grown in wisdom and humanity because we heard and learned our
 
great  songs.
 
Such work was also necessary because,  throughout
 
history,  most people have thought that  folk and traditional
 
musics existed simply to entertain the uneducated and/or to
 
inspire,  feed and nourish the "higher" musical arts.  A lot of
 
people still think so.  When I was a teen-ager working at the
 
Library of Congress,  such eminent composers as Aaron Copland
 
and Virgil Thompson came in looking for some  interesting
 
musical folk idioms but most urgently for solid and long-
lasting melodies  for use in their symphonic compositions.  And
 
I helped find the field recordings that they listened to and
 
later put to extensive use.  Charles Seeger himself composed a
 
symphonic variation that wove together 7 or 8 of the many
 
elegant melodies  folks had developed for a single romantic
 
ballad,  "John Riley".  (It was years  later that  I heard
 
Leonard Bernstein say that  in his experience the hardest
 
single part of musical  composition  is to latch on to a really
 
15
 
good,  memorable tune.  No wonder American composers were
 
interested to find an archive full of them!)
 
So the composers sat  in the Archive of American Folksong
 
jotting down the tunes of the songs they heard there,  and
 
professional copyists  copied down any transcribed tunes they
 
could find so that music publishers could copyright them,  and
 
the people who wanted to learn songs or teach them to
 
children in school  looked inside  folk song books  for sources
 
of material,  and folklorists spent months and years chasing
 
down the original author/composer of particular songs
 
believing sincerely that when they had found that out,  they
 
would know the single thing that was the most important to
 
know.  For every song was a thing, and things have makers and
 
copiers and owners,  and big money-generating industries can
 
be built around them,  and were.  But the recording machine
 
took the  song out of the book and the library and the
 
printing press and brought  it to life as an event in time and
 
space.
 
And then still other brand new problems arose,  for each
 
time a song was  recorded,  it was a new event,  and these
 
events multiplied,  and pretty soon each song was a
 
conglomeration of multiple events complete with multiple
 
variations,  and after a while what on earth was  it you were
 
dealing with?
 I remember hearing Charles Seeger say once
 
that the only truly unchangeable  (and therefore
 
copyrightable)  thing about a piece of music was the pattern
 
of the grooves  cut  into a record.  And now we don't even have
 
grooves any more,  and we are still dealing with the
 
challenging effects of this revolutionary shift of emphasis
 
from print to sound,
 
I never knew it when  it was not  a struggle.  For the
 
early recordists to do their field work,  it was not only an
 
intellectual and social struggle but a downright physical one
 
as well.  Even after the period of the cyllinder and the
 
fearsome horn into which only the RCA dog seemed able to sing
 
with any pleasure,  came the enormous back-breaking "portable"
 
recording machines,  each one run off of 4 to  6 automobile
 
batteries,  and served by weighty boxes of 16 inch discs.  At
 
one point  in the 40s when Father took the daring step of
 
buying a brand new Ford to take him just once more through
 
the  southern backwoods,  he had the garage rip out the whole
 
back seat  and install a built-in platform with a special set
 
of shock absorbers to accomodate the burden.  And I will  spare
 
you the horrors of the subsequent wire  recorders,  their huge
 
tangled spools eyed grimly by the most dauntless of Library
 
of Congress  sound engineers.
 
But other major consequences kept on rippling out  from
 
the central disturbance -
-
 for example,  the  specific singer
 
of a song,  typically recognized in print by a simple
 
footnote,  became  in recordings a person of prominence and
 
importance,  a "performing artist."  Indeed in popular music,
 
the name of the artist came to be far more commercially
 
valuable than the name of the song he or she was  singing.
 
Recording contracts were proof of that,  even conserving
 
royalty money by requiring singers to compose their own
 
songs,  since buyers cared much more who was  singing than
 
which song was being sung.  (
Parenthetically,  I believe this
 
development certainly accelerated,  if it did not  indeed
 
initiate,  the massive decline in quality of the American
 
popular song in recent years.  Many excellent  singers turned
 
out to be  less than competent composers,  and in general it
 
appears that there are many more good song singers than good
 
song writers.)
 
Another major change was the enormous  increase in
 
availability,  for the general listener,  of both local
 
American and worldwide musics.  Only fifty years ago one could
 
not listen seriously to African-American work song singers or
 
Mexican-American corridistas or Anglo-American shape note
 
congregations without travelling to the place where they were
 
actually making the music,  or visiting the Archive of
 
American Folk Song at the Library of Congress or the Archives
 
of Traditional Music at the University of Indiana.  There was
 
some spasmodic commercial recording of these musics,  but
 
basically it was the academic archives that held in trust the
 
voices of the varied peoples of the United States -
-
 the non-
standard,  specialized,  quirky,  powerful,  angry,  hopeful
 
individuals who had broken free  from the second-handedness of
 
print and allowed their especial musical talents,  their
 
especial musical visions,  and their own private voices to be
 
recorded for the benefit of -
-
 God knows who they thought.
 
I recently listened to some old field recordings my
 
father made and every time he recorded a tune he said,  "This
 
song was  sung by Mister so and so of such and such a town,
 
recording on thus and such a date for the Library of Congress
  
in Washington!" He made it  sound so important.  Maybe they
 
thought the Congress was going to listen to them -
-
 or maybe
 
President Roosevelt.  Maybe,  in a way,  that's what did
 
happen;  things  certainly aren't the same as they used to be.
 
For whenever I like,  I can now listen to the major
 
repertoires of hundreds of different world-wide cultures and
 
almost every small group in every state in the union.  (
If I
 
had my brother's magical "Global Jukebox" at my personal
 
disposal,  I could not only triple or quadruple this
 
repertoire but vastly enhance,  with critically important
 
ethnographic information and film,  the musics available to me
 
at  a fingertip.)  And all this richness  is right there for
 
anybody -
-
 awkward to get hold of maybe and costly,  but
 
still,  it  is there.  Thanks to the prevailing recording
 
machine,  these musics are no longer within the private
 
purview of the people who happen to live in a particular part
 
7
 
of the world,  or the people who have troubled to go to that
 
part of the world,  or the people who have announced
 
themselves to be world music students and scholars.
 
And this  is a brand new state of affairs.  The nature,
 
significance and responsibilities of the work of folklore and
 
ethnomusicology have changed forever.  Nothing is a simple
 
one-way street anymore.  Everything works differently in
 
imponderable and disconcerting ways.
 
A couple of years ago a Boston friend told me a story
 
about a Masssachusetts  student of African music who had
 
climaxed his  studies by spending several years  in a
 
particular African nation as a disciple of a particular
 
master tribal drummer.  Upon his return to the United States,
 
the young student determined to try to recreate in all  its
 
glory the marvellous music he had tried to learn,  and in the
 
process he transformed himself into a one-man band,  attaching
 
pulleys and levers to his body through which he could sound
 
the bell pattern with his  right
 hand while he led the mama
 
drum with his left  foot and
 handled the shakers by nodding
 
his head and so forth.  It was an enormously complex venture
 
and he was  legitimately proud when he could finally bring it
 
all off,  cross-rhythms and all.  And then he heard that his
 
old teacher from Africa was coming to town with a visiting
 
troupe.  He delightedly made an appointment to see him at his
 
hotel,  he arrayed himself for a triumphal performance and he
 
played his heart out.  And his teacher looked at him
 
affectionately and remarked,  "Oh,  you poor fellow.  Don't you
 
have anybody to play with?"
 
Here we  see African musical norms being applied to
 
European musical tactics and what are we to make of that?
 
The communicative dyad is more of a triad or a quartet or a
 
chorus these days,  and folklorists and ethnomusicologists can
 
no  longer think of themselves as  lonely explorers  into
 
uncharted areas.  Nowadays we are engaged in continual
 
conversations with everybody -
-
 musicians,  educators,  deans,
 
concert promoters,  singers,  radio producers,  griots,  record
 
company executives,  community activists,  politicians,
 
reporters,  students,  and the Lord knows who all.  The one man
 
band is out  for us.
 
Folklorists are perhaps a bit more used to this,  since
 
their data is generally expressed through the standard
 
alphabet  rather than specialized notation methods,  and they
 
have always emphasized standard European languages as well.
 
Thereby,  as general literacy became the norm,  folklorists'
 
so-called informants  could and did read the books  in which
 
their material was printed and they were duly critical of the
 
results,  all the way from how the book royalties were handled
 
down to the iconography -
-
 "It's neither right  spelt nor
 
right  setten'  down," as an irate country lady remarked to Sir
 
Walter Scott on one historic occasion.
 
So none of us who consider ourselves  scholars,  lovers,
 
or savants of music any longer work alone  (if ever we did)
 
nor do we work the way we used to.  But we have not become
 
irrelevant either.  In fact  I believe that the work of the
 
afficionado,  the dedicated student,  the deep lover of
 
particular art  forms  from both inside and outside the culture
 
may become ever more  important and ever more necessary as
 
time goes by.
 
One of the more troubling general assumptions of our
 
period is that any member of any group by simple virtue of
 
that membership has an inborn,  unmatchable  intellectual tie
 
with its  cultural manifestations.  This  is  just not true.  It
 
would be  so nice if it were,  but the fact  is that many -
 
possibly even most -
 people of the majority and of smaller
 
groups,  are simply not  interested.  They have chosen to focus
 
their efforts upon other fields,  and that  is well.  We don't
 
need everyone to be a cultural authority.  But we do need
 
some,  and it  is plain that the kind of perspective essential
 
to the understanding of any art  form is developed through
 
intense,  disciplined and comparative study,  no matter if the
 
student  is an insider or an outsider of the particular
 
culture.  For both it  represents hard,  self-dedicated work and
 
attentiveness,  the kind of strict professional attention I
 
saw Ruth and Charles  Seeger devoting to my father's and
 
brother's  field recordings.
 
But what,  in another fifty years,  will be there for us
 
insiders or outsiders,  or our insider and outsider grand-
children,  to study? When I look at a record or tape or CD
 
these days and note the date when the recording was actually
 
made,  I begin to wonder.  Most were made so long ago.  Even the
 
new ones tend to be re-releases.  In fact,  when I talk to
 
people today about the necessity of field work,  especially
 
recording,  many inform me gently that all that kind of thing
 
has already been done.  And I laugh,  but then I wonder what
 
are they telling me? Are the peoples of the world actually
 
abandoning their own glorious historical musical achievements
 
while their young folks busy themselves learning how to grab
 
a few dimes off today's amplified pop music merry-go-round?
 
Do they feel resigned to letting their music go on the cheap
 
so that  somebody from an outside musical world can fix it up
 
for a more remunerative pay-back? Such questions don't go
 
away,  even if no one knows the answers yet.
 
Back in the fall of  1975  I attended my first  SEM meeting
 
with the  idea of telling the membership that during the
 
summer of  1976 a marvellous event was to take place in
 
Washington,  D.C.  -
-
 a summer-long Festival of American Folk-
life during which traditional artists  from across the United
 
States would conjoin with traditional artists  from their
 
original  country or tribe.  At the least,  I said in my naive
 
enthusiasm,  exciting,  previously unheard musicians would be
 
appearing on the Mall,  and at the best,  some significant
 
interchanges between old and new world musicians might occur
 
that might  lead to some re-invigoration of marginal musics.
 
I was quite unprepared for the general  lack of
 
enthusiasm my report  received.  I was politely told by one
 
responding speaker that the events  I was projecting were only
 
of marginal interest to the Society,  that  festivals were
 
purely temporal events of no long-term consequence,  and that
 
the true  function of ethnomusicology was to record reality -
 
in this period,  the  inevitable gradual collapse of local
 
musics under the onslaught of national popular musics.  I was
 
astonished.  It  seemed such a bleak,  such a totally
 
unappealing prospect.  Surely,  I thought,  the whole discipline
 
can't want  simply to take notes on the relative rate of
 
decline of their subject.  Maybe  I hadn't heard the unvoiced
 
reaction -
 there must have been one.
 
And of course  I hadn't.  Many ethnomusicologists came to
 
contribute to,  learn from,  and delight  in that vast  summer
 
spectacle.  I had many chances to talk with them,  and I came
 
to realize that many had honest and deep concerns about the
 
appropriateness of their participation in such events.  Their
 
training had told them that  scholars  should always remain
 
separate  from the topic they study and that they must  in
 
every way attempt not to influence the course of its
 
development. (This  is,  if nothing else,  a position that  grants
 
a genuine dignity to both parties  involved -
-
 the students
 
and the studied.)  But others had other points of view.
 
For one thing it  seemed plain to many that culture never 
is  just a popularity contest with winner take all.  Within any
 
ongoing population there will always be a number of active
 
artistic traditions -
-
 old-timey,  new-fangled,  idiosyncratic,
 
original,  imitative,  archaic -
-
 all concurrent,  all  jostling
 
for place and a piece of the action,  all lively and
 
meaningful.  Different  forces  in and out of the culture
 
support and further different choices within this menu.
 
Personally,  I tend to find that  I am an unregenerate
 
moldy fig,  and thus  inevitably discover myself backing the
 
older traditions,  no matter how broad-minded I try to be.
 
Indeed,  I have  found it well to convey my personal
 
preferences early on in new situations  so that if  I should
 
happen to go a bit overboard,  people can say,  "Oh well,
 
that's  just the way she is." And that  seems acceptable to
 
most people  I meet  in the  field,  for most  such people are of
 
a kindly disposition.
 
But  I think some of us believe that it  is unfair and
 
manipulative for scholars and savants to express anything but
 
total neutrality in such ongoing cultural  struggles.  Aside
 
from neutrality's making for awfully boring conversations,  I
 
think this position overestimates the actual weight and
 
importance of scholarly opinions.  At the Folk Arts Program in
 
the Arts Endowment we  found out quickly the  limits of
 
outsider views -
 even those that are backed by grant money -
 
for although our scholarly panel might vote not to fund a
 
project,  the local  folks very often went right on ahead and
 
did it anyway.
 
It  is actually rare  for scholars and savants to wield
 
coercive power.  Our contributions tend to work towards
 
slanting,  mediating,  highlighting,  pointing things out,  maybe
 
scrambling them up -
-
 but generally we  serve interconnecting
 
functions.  So most of the time we needn't worry that our
 
pronouncements are going to directly change anything in
 
particular or that we will do anything catastrophic by
 
publicly expressing our delight  in,  concern for,  or worries
 
about  such phenomena as  local musical traditions and artists.
 
And we have an obligation to do as well as we can  just
 
what  it  is that we do.  Ethnomusicologists are important parts
 
of human  society,  and we are supposed to be  in there
 
pitching.  If we weren't there,  we would have to be invented,
 
for music is  important.  In the NEA Folk Arts Program,  Dan
 
Sheehy,  Terry Liu,  Barry Bergey,  a host of collaborators,  and
 
I have had that proven to us over and over again as we
 
watched a fifteen year spectacle of musical  situations
 
develop,  misfire,  subside,  explode and thrive.  And we learned
 
that every form of music is  important  for somebody no matter
 
how "micro" the music or the population.  Music is the
 
ultimate morale builder;  its absence is always associated
 
with listlessness and anomie.  Ethnomusicologists all really
 
know this,  and when they ask me what they can do to help the
 
musics of the world flourish in the strange times we live in,
 
I tell them there are  lots of things,  most of them very
 
simple,  all of them quite consonant with academic and
 
scholarly responsibilities.
 
For one thing,  every ethnomusicologist  can devote energy
 
to the performance of the simple,  straightforward Ruth Seeger
 
manouvre,  continually and publicly pointing out the
 
complexity and intrinsic interest of the musical forms that
 
surround us  in the world.  It's a truism that all teaching
 
doesn't have to take place  in a classroom,  but we need to
 
look actively for more opportunities to make what we know
 
more widely available especially to the musicians themselves,
 
who often lack the language and the data that will help them
 
defend their own musics.  There are many ways to do this,  and
 
many more to be discovered and developed.  For one example,
 
David Roche has  invented a brand new way of teaching within a
 
festival,  calling for "pop-up presenters," people who will
 
wander around in crowds  starting conversations about the
 
performances,  drawing attention to their technical
 
1
)
 
complexity,  their originality,  showing people how to listen.
 
That's teaching.
 
And then every ethnomusicologist  can look carefully
 
about the place where he is-- not where she might  like to be
 
-
-
 noting the kind of people who live there,  finding out what
 
their musical state of life is,  assessing the vitality and
 
the artistry that  lives or droops or thrives  in the
 
surrounding community.  Always remember that the United States
 
is the end point of most of the recent mass human migrations
 
and we therefore willy-nilly host many world-level artists
 
here.  Many of them are in fine shape,  but far too many are
 
disconnected,  despondent,  out of practice,  embarrassed,
 
angry,  desperately in need of an interpreter,  a mentor -
 or
 
even more simply,  an agent -
 some bit of help in cracking
 
through to audiences  in this  strange land.
 
I find the number of ethnomusicologists who have no
 
knowledge of or connection with the musical  life of the place
 
where they live most troubling.  This  isn't quite as true of
 
folklorists,  who have a tendency to work within their own
 
geographic area and language,  while ethnomusicologists are
 
scampering across the  face of the globe.  This difference is
 
noticeable even in the classroom;  an ethnomusicologist  is  far
 
more likely to bring to class a visiting musician from Korea
 
than a local blues guitarist,  while a folklorist will take
 
just the opposite tack.  Perhaps we should join forces,  but  in
 
any case  I urge  looking with greater care into the local
 
musical community resources.  Musicians,  after all,  need to be
 
employed.  If they don't get  jobs,  they stop being musicians
 
and do something else.  It's as  simple as that;  if you want
 
musicians to thrive,  get them some work.
 
Further,  every ethnomusicologist  can and should function
 
as a critic.  Maintenance of standards  is absolutely essential
 
to the health of any art  form.  It  is easy enough for a
 
production of "Oklahoma" or even "Carmen" to get a sensible
 
and informed response  from a general audience along with some
 
good ideas  in next day's newspaper reviews  for the
 
improvement of future performances.  This  is not the case for
 
the multi-cultural  festivals,  for the  "visiting national
 
troupe from the Caucasus," or for the  local Chinese opera
 
production.  All these efforts deserve and could benefit
 
enormously from carefully thought out,  engaging,  and well-
informed professional printed reviews.  Audiences would
 
benefit too;  more people read newspapers than attend
 
Ethnomusicology  101  classes.
 
And finally,  every ethnomusicologist  should take on the
 
responsibility of developing some minimal degree of practical
 
entrepreneurship,  learning how to make the musics we so
 
/
 2
 
deeply admire more broadly accessible.  There are  so many ways
 
to do this -
-
 good solid academic ways.
 
I recently read a report  from a folklorist,  Jonathan
 
David,  who became fascinated with a particular African
 
American religious  song tradition practiced in rural areas
 
around his host university.  He followed it  from little church
 
to little church,  mapped out  its provenience,  made friends
 
with the  folks who sang it and the ministers whose churches
 
hosted it,  and after a couple of years developed it into his
 
dissertation topic.  So far -
-
 so normal.  But he also worked
 
out with the practicing groups the following scheme:  first,  a
 
recording was produced from his  field work that  included many
 
of the active singers.  He applied for grant money to publish
 
both cassettes and CD's of the work,  distributing more than
 
600  casssettes to group members as partial honoraria and more
 
than 400  complimentary CDs to archives,  historical societies,
 
college  libraries,  and non-profit radio stations  in the area.
 
The  issuance of the recording was heralded by a public
 
symposium at which both academic and religious leaders  spoke,
 
and each of the 29 still active musical groups  in the region
 
were awarded an honorarium of $250.00 -
-
 the largest  single
 
expense of the project.  Future profits  (in terms of royalties
 
which will undoubtedly be microscopic)  are being placed in a
 
trust  fund for the Singing and Praying Bands,  as they call
 
themselves,  three members of which have been elected as
 
trustees along with the director of the local museum and the
 
project director.
 
It  is too early to tell the effect of this project upon
 
the music itself -
-
 like many another vivid and electrifying
 
music it  comes  from a non-standard doctrinal group whose
 
activities tend to be snubbed by more respectable uptown
 
churches,  and some controversy over the increased prominence
 
of these nonconformists  is to be expected.  But overall the
 
project  seems a model of responsible broad-brush inclusive
 
planning,  clearly and positively educational,  in the best
 
sense of the term.
 
The project director recently received a letter written
 
by the son of two of the local singers  (on stationery from
 
the Wall Street  firm where he works)
 
.in this age of Afro-centrism -
 or the adding of value
 
to the history of people of African descent-  (your)  work
 
takes on increased importance.  No longer will my forefathers
 
be  looked at as wild beasts who are too ignorant to know any
 
better,  but as Africans who adopted Christianity and brought
 
their age-old,  traditional  style of worship to this new faith
 
and new land.  Be encouraged,  your work is greatly
 
appreciated.  .

 What a compliment.  Good as an A any day.
 
I think there are hundreds of such potential projects
 
lying around just waiting for an energetic,  competent,
 
responsible,  patient  scholar to add his or her expertise to
 
the mix.  Don't worry;  you won't  get  far if the musicians
 
themselves don't want to work with you,  or if the project
 
really doesn't  suit the folks.  And think of the high school
 
classes where you might be able to help present a Vietnamese
 
musician or a local  instrument maker.  Or consider the local
 
community radio or t. v.  station where you could play your
 
record collection as Fred Lieberman did when he used to bill
 
himself as  "the world's  first equal opportunity disc  jockey."
 
He would put on an Albanian record and then say,  "Hey,  is
 
there anybody listening out there that's from Albania?
 Why
 
don't you bring your own records  in to the  station and we'll
 
put them together with mine and have a whole program of this
 
great  stuff!" There are thousands of things to do.
 
And so I want to close with a challenge.  I have recently
 
retired from the National Endowment  for the Arts,  a federal
 
granting agency charged with the  following mission:
 "to
 
foster the excellence,  diversity and vitality of the arts  in
 
the United States today and to help broaden the availability
 
and appreciation of such excellence,  diversity and vitality."
 
Did you know about that? Did you know that that  language is
 
now part of the  law of our land?  It  still gives me
 
goosebumps.  But there  it  is and forty years ago it wasn't.  We
 
were not thinking about music or art as national resources.
 
But now we have a clear statement,  codified into legalese and
 
well expressed,  and it  says that the work of the musician,
 
the dancer,  the artist has  stature and is a proper matter of
 
national concern.  The arts are right up there with housing
 
and foreign relations and commerce and national defense.
 
Of course the arts don't get much money.  The actual
 
funds the National Endowment  for the Arts has in its annual
 
budget these days tends to be in the neighborhood of 175
 
million,  give or take a million or two.  That  really is
 
peanuts  in Washington terms.  But the other day I took the
 
peanuts and sorted them out roughly and came up with some
 
interesting figures -
 large approximations,  of course.
 
Something over  60% of the  175 million goes out directly
 
to  fund arts projects and institutions,  rather than being
 
given out through state or regional arts agencies or utilized
 
in manners other than direct grants.  This  leaves around 105
 
million for grants to the various art  forms:  theater,  visual
 
arts,  literature,  dance,  media arts and so on.  For various
 
historical reasons,  music has always been the fiscal leader
 
at the NEA.  In most years  20 to 25 percent of grants monies
 
go toward the support of what most people call classical
 
music -
-
 opera,  choral,  chamber,  symphonic,  including even a
 
small amount  for  jazz -
-
 a figure that  in 1992 amounted to
 
approximately 23 million dollars.
 
The two Endowment programs that  fund all other kinds of
 
music  (along with all other genres of traditional arts)  tend
 
to devote at a generous estimate perhaps a third of their
 
budgets to funding music projects -
-
 together perhaps  3
 
million dollars.
 
So,  of the total number of dollars the National
 
Endowment  for the Arts expends annually in direct grants to
 
music projects of all kinds,  89% goes to "classical" western
 
European music leaving 11%  for all other musics  including:
 
"American folk music",  the classical musics of non-western
 
European cultures and such indigenous  forms as the blues,
 
blue grass,  gospel,  conjunto,  salsa,  klezmer,  et al.
 
That proportion  is a bit  startling,  when it appears  in
 
print,  isn't  it?
 When I was working at the Endowment,  for
 
the  last  five or six years  I used to feel  I was endlessly
 
swimming in an  indoor pool and that the level of the water -
-
the  level of need and demand -
-
 kept on rising,  so that there
 
was  less and less air between me and the ceiling,  and no
 
matter how hard I swam I just couldn't  figure out how to push
 
that  roof any higher.  I was  stuck.
 
And maybe  I was  right.  Let's  look beyond the range of
 
government,  for government  is an awfully easy target,  as
 
every day's newspaper shows.  Let's  look at our own home
 
grounds -
-
 the academy.  I'll wager that the ratio between the
 
budgets  for classical music instruction  (including music
 
teacher training)  and for training in all other musics
 
(ethnomusicology)  in  90% of American universities  is no whit
 
more equitable than that of the  federal budget.  Indeed,  this
 
may well be why the federal budget  is and bids fair to stay
 
so low -
-
 it reflects the  situation we have allowed to
 
maintain across the country.  We have not made our case.
 
I know many of you are weary from the endless  struggle
 
within your own separate institutions,  and I know that you
 
have valiantly raised the  issue of our European dominated
 
academics time and again.  But we must never stop.  We must
 
seek new sources of strength,  perhaps through alliances with
 
other groups,  both academic and lay.  Throughout my remarks  I
 
have been emphasizing the changes that  I have seen during
 
this half-century.  We must begin to re-align our strategies
 
to these changes by going beyond the simple dyad of
 
author/reader or the  imitative pattern of record/listener or
 
television program/viewer.  The technical revolution now
 
provides us with possibilities  for communication moving every
 
which way all around the world,  enormously extending the
 
potential  for truly meaningful and significant conversations.
 
We may thus  find ourselves able to join hands with previously
 
unsuspected allies -
 most particularly and most happily,  the
 
musicians themselves.  But there  is much to do.
 
At the  1992 Festival of the Pacific Arts on the island
 
of Rarotonga in the Cook Islands there was a pre-festival
 
conference that  I was  allowed to attend as observer.  One of
 
the participants was  an elegant,  dignified and gentle-spoken
 
senior woman from American Samoa who spoke as  follows;  (
this
 
is not verbatim,  but a summary from my notes of what  she
 
said.)
 "I was born and brought up in American Samoa,  but  I
 
went to the United States  for my advanced education,  and I am
 
now back home working as an educator in my turn.  During my
 
undergraduate and graduate career in several American
 
universities,  I took many art appreciation courses,  some in
 
visual and some  in the musical arts,  and I loved them.  But
 
now that  I am back home,  I realize that  I never once heard
 
any music other than European in any one of my classes.  And
 
now I am president of the Community College  in American
 
Samoa,  the only institution of higher education there,  and I
 
hope that  someday I will  find a way to  learn about the music
 
of the Pacific  Islands."
 
And I found myself both embarrassed and ashamed.  I
 
hardly knew where to look,  especially since  I don't think
 
things are the  least bit better now than when she was
 
receiving her aesthetic "education." Think back to those
 
devastating budget  figures -
-
 90%  for European music,  10%  for
 
the rest of the world -
-
 and this  in a time when "multi-
culturalism"  is the watchword and hardly anybody knows what
  
it means. Can't we grab that multi-cultural ball and do some
 
running with it?
 As a discipline? As an organization?
 
Suppose we took as a simple common purpose to try to see to
 
it that no American can ever again go through their education
 
without hearing  just one piece of music from a Pacific
 
Island,  or China -
-
 Africa -
-
 Alaska -
-
 the other places of
 
the world we all live  in together? Could we not work up a
 
plan for doing that very simple thing that could be sent to
 
Washington  (which is a very different place these days)  so
 
that nobody ever again can say what that college president
 
said.  Or could we not  just do it,  each one of us  seeing to
 
our own part  in our own place?  I think a lot of people would
 
like that  idea and would support  it.  Couldn't we at  least
 
give it a try?  It would be a beginning.
