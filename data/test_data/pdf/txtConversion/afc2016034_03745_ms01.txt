Interview Log 
00:00:01 Introduction 
00:00:13 Job title and description; Program Manager for the Gay-Lesbian-Bisexual-Transgender 
(GLBT) Host Home Program for the nonprofit, Avenues for Homeless Youth (Avenues); 
Avenues has four host home programs, two of which are queer/trans-specific; Rocki is 
manager of the oldest one, which offers longer-term host homes; the other two are 
suburban host home programs; 
00:01:46 History of the need for host homes; early-mid '90s; people noticed that programs for 
homeless GLBT youth were not addressing their specific needs, such as: 
• Youth feeling they could not be "out" about their identity; 
• Youth lacking confidence in staff respecting that identity; 
• Staff not stopping homophobic or transphobic language from guests or other staff; 
• Respect and safety for trans youth in a shelter system that is gendered—that is, male 
beds and female beds; 
Due to this, GLBT youth would not stay in shelter as long, so remained homeless longer 
without access to services; monthly group of workers and community members called 
"Partnership for GLBT Youth" met at District 202 to look at resources and needs; Matt Halley 
was the first openly GLBT individual hired specifically to work with GLBT youth in the Twin 
Cities metro at Youthlink; Richard Wayman was also a member; host home program was 
developed by this group based on the model used by The Center in Denver, Colorado; 
homelessness not on the radar of national GLBT rights groups at this point; 
00:11:47 Rocki hired Fall 1996 by Youthlink's Project Offstreets Program of the Minneapolis Youth 
Diversion Program; Rocki is from Brazil; discussion of status; Masters of Social Work; 
received her green card under a "special interest waiver" due specifically to her work with 
queer and transgender youth; April 1997, the first young person moved into a host home;

Description of how a host home works; her job is to recruit, screen, train, and support adults 
who volunteer to host; hosts don't have to be queer or trans, but the majority are; they 
open their homes to a young person; average stay about a year; longest stay close to four 
years; shortest stay a couple weeks; the program is intentionally outside the system and 
doesn't use government funding; it's intentionally not foster care because youth leaving 
traditional foster care too frequently become homeless; young people get to choose the 
host home; participants today are ages 16-24-years-old; hosts apply, write letter for youth 
to make a choice; youth can also see background information such as criminal check; in 
these ways the balance of power is flipped from traditional foster care; hosts have very little 
information about the youth; 
Rock! is more the case manager for the hosts; another youth worker is the case manager for 
the youth; home visits done monthly; 
Intentionally keep the program small; no more than ten active host homes at one time; 
Rock! shares the model and encourages others to start other small host home programs; 
belief that GLBT host home model works because it was community-driven; 
Discussion of the error of lack of focus on racial justice in the 1990s planning; Minnesota as 
a state largely Caucasian and with history of charity rather than justice; white liberalism; 
majority of queer and transgender youth who are experiencing homeless are youth of color 
while hosts are typically white, middle-class people; planners assumed the program would 
be for GLBT youth who had been kicked out of their homes—this is the most common 
narrative about homeless GLBT youth: parents kicked them out for being GLBT; but there 
are also queer and trans youth who are loved by their parents but are living in poverty, 
creating a hierarchy of valuing kicked out youth over homeless youth in poor families who 
become homeless for economic reasons; demonizing families rather than demonizing 
systems; 
Discussion of how youth come into the program; differs among populations; juvenile justice 
systems; chemical dependency facilities; self-referrals; other organizations who would 
provide case management while the youth was in a Host Home program; school counselor 
referral; variety of creative ways of providing case management, including volunteers; 
Discussion of funding and funding cuts and impact on program; Rocki's move from Youthlink 
to Avenues for Homeless Youth; a United Way "Arise Project" grant enables them to hire 
case managers; youth can decide if they want to keep a supportive adult in their life; 
Specific discussion about 16-17 year old program participants; there is not an emancipation 
process; parent/guardian has to sign a Delegation of Parental Authority (DOPA) to be in the 
Host Home program; have also had 15-year-olds in the program; story of a youth where a 
judge signed the DOPA as being in the youth's best interest; generally not seen as a referral 
source for wards of the state because its outside the system, not licensed; 
More details about how the program works: Rock! and co-worker Ryan practice "old school 
community organizing"; attending events; speaking opportunities; Rock! thinks of herself 
more as an activist rather than a licensed social worker; word of mouth is an important tool; 
hosts are interviewed twice, sometimes three times, references, criminal background checks 
and sixteen hours of training over a weekend; focus on youth issues, but also issues the 
hosts may have such as power dynamics and/or racial privilege; story of an applicant who 
was unwilling to look at his own privilege; reasons host applicants aren't ready to host; 
Expectations of hosts: housing and food, but also good communications, boundaries, and 
flexibility; Rock! views her role as half supporting host parents and half challenging them;

help them understand normal teen behavior or trauma or survival, or the hosts own issues; 
host trainings include documentaries, "Homeless Youth: Finding Home" made by Twin Cities 
Public Television and the Wilder Foundation and "The Infamous T" by filmmaker Melissa 
Cook; 
Aside about "The Infamous T"; discussion of how social services can exploit young people's 
stories; Rocki prefers artists or external individuals that help youth tell their own stories, 
such as Kulture Klub; story about working with Melissa Cook and Jonathon, the focus of 
"The Infamous T" and his experiences, including with the Host Home Program; 
Included in the training is someone who talks about positive youth development and trauma 
and resiliency; trans 101; white privilege; panel of individuals serving as existing host home 
parents; panel of young people who were or are in the program; 
Defining success in the program; story of a former host's definition of success in the 
program; the program goal is that for "x" months, the young person didn't have to worry 
about food or shelter; graduating from high school, getting a job, saving money, improved 
relationships are the icing on the cake; 
Types of host homes; a closet-turned-bedroom for short-term; sleeping on the couch; 
licensure would not enable these types of situations even though the youth may choose it 
over other options; 
Discussion of current availability of shelter for youth in the Twin Cities Metro; not enough; 
Avenues for Homeless Youth has two shelters: 20 beds in North Minneapolis and 12 beds in 
Brooklyn Park; in Minneapolis, providers of youth shelter include The Bridge, Hope Street 
Shelter, Ain Dah Yung in St. Paul; permanent and transitional programs include Youthlink's 
Barnabas, Archdale, Nicollet Square; 
Discussion of the need to support families rather than demonize the families of homeless 
GLBT youth; story about a phone call from a greater Minnesota mom of a transgender 
youth; 
Discussion of whether this work will continue; Rocki notes that young people are more savvy 
about intersectionality, and identity; her daughter's role in Black Lives Matter; Trump 
administration, misogyny, sexism, privilege; charity vs. solidarity; foresees more authentic 
movements that aren't about single issues; 
Regarding the future of homelessness/housing, hopes to see more responses that are 
"outside the system"; the need for creativity in community responses balanced with rules, 
"best practices" or funders requiring certain outcomes; trusting community responses; 
Discussion about United Way funding requirements, funder reports; Rocki reports on: 
getting five new host homes every year to maintain 20-25 homes; three trainings per year; 
ten young people in host homes at any given time; 75% of youth move into other stable 
housing;
