IC GSTER 
FAYETTE LODAWICK ROBINSON. 
This live showman—more preperly known as " Yankee Robinson" 
—is a 
direct lineal descendant ot Dr. _Robinson, the eminent divine 
who canto to this country in the" _M ay Plower." 
Ile was born near
 
Avon, Alineral Springs, Livingston county, N. Y., May 2d, 1818. 
Cora-
l rimmed his career in the show business, with Old Sickles' show. 
Ile made his first appearance on any stage at a 
school exhibition in 
his native town, as tf onathan Doolittle, in the play of " A Yankee in 
England." In 1836 he NV cut to _Niedina, Mich., built a 
shop, and carried 
on the business or shoemaking with great encouragement. At the 
cod of a 
year he returned home and was married, and i
n a 
few months 
after, his wife died. 
We next find him on a 
traveling tour, for a 
few 
months, bringing up at Dausville, N. Y., AN here lie again embarked 
extensively in the shoe trade, when he married ag..in. 
In December following he found himself in St. Louis, Mo., -where 
he made his first appearance in tiagtAly as Radclitie in " Richard III." 
He went througn Illinois and 
isconsin, part of the time in con-
nectiou with June and Turner s Circus. 
Ile organized a 
ROOM Show at Eaton, Preble county, Ohio. his wife, 
who assisted, afterward made her mark in general chambermaids and 
particularly Yankee gals. 
Ho traveled under the title of the " Robin-
Family. "  play 
ill g tames, singing quartettes, comic songs, etc. Ho 
made his mark in localizing -Yankee stories, in which be has no equal. 
Finding his business increasing, he then made a 
tent with his own 
hands, at Quincy, Illinois, and started May 2tli , 
1851. he soon dis-
banded, losing all be had accumulated, and several thousand dollars 
bessdes. The following winter he built another tent at Rock Island, 
Illinois, and started the " Robinson Athenremn," playing the " Drunk-
ard," and like pieces. Ile finally selected Indianapolis as headquarters 
playing in winter and travelling with a 
canvas in the summer. Do 
has been extensively engaged since in circuses and animal shows. 
While in Columbia. S. C., m 1809, his wife died, and for a 
while our 
hero was nearly broken up ; but the indomitable spirit broke forth 
anew, and success was varied for a 
few years. He made his first ap-
pearance as a " star," at Grover's Theatre, -Washington, D, C., and 
last at Crosby's Opera House, Chicago, when his success was beyond 
any similar attraction. 
Ho has now the largest show in America.

li;ted with the three nionthq,boys, 
Way down in old Varninint ; 
Our capting, he was a 
real hoss, 
He'd W 
hip a 
catamount. 
Jist as the roll was all filed up, 
We started off for war; 
We did not care who we fit with, 
We waent par-tic-u-lar. 
'We landed down in Washington, 
With knapsacks all well filled ; 
But our capting tho't, before we fought, 
We'd better all be drilled— 
So 'twas, ' eyes right," " toes out,"" form in line," 
Aud " march out, tew by tew ;" 
But there wan't a man in the company, 
That any of these things could do. 
Our sargent finally made a 
move, 
Which all of us thought right, 
That every man in the company 
On his own hook should fight; 
So off we started in the night, 
And just as day begun, 
We jilted U. Sam's grand army, 
And arrived safe at Bull Run. 
When the ball began to whistle round my head, 
I 
felt a 
sort a 
skittish, 
For I'd oft times heaid my Gran Dad tell 
'Bout fight in' with the Brittish ; 
So I 
jump'd behind a 
big stone wall— 
Never thought about the stretcher— 
And every time I 
raised " old betsy" up, 
Down pop'd a 
d—d 
sesesher. 
I 
fit till I 
got a 
little tired, 
And begun to feel a 
sort of dry ; 
And as I 
raised my canteen up, 
I 
spied 
Black Horse' Cavalry : 
So I 
cut dirt and run like a 
deer, 
(Yew couldn't see my coat tail for the dust,) 
At two-forty pace, ! cn thousand in the race, 
Tow see who'd get to Washington fut.

Angels on de wing,

On dis darkie's head. 
CHORUS.

THE PUGNACIOUS PURP. 
A man he owned a 
terrier dorg— 
A bobtail,: „ oinry cuss— 
And that there purp got that there man 
In many - in ugly muss ; 
.For the man he was on his mussel, 
And the dorg was on his bite, 
So to kick that dorg-goned animile 
Was sure t,) raise a 
tight 
A woman she owned a 
Thomas cat, 
That fit at fifteen pound. 
And other cats got up and slid 
When that there cat was round. 
The man and his dorg came along one day 
Where the woman she did dwell, 
And the parts he growled ferociously. 
Then went for the cat like 
lie tried, for to chaw the neck of the cat, 
But the cat he wouldn't be cltawed, 
So lie lit on the back of that there dorg, 
And bit, and chAwed, and clawed! 
Oh ! the hair it flew I 
and the pump he yowled . 
As the claws went into his hide, 
And chunks of flesh were pealed from his back, 
Then he flummixed, and kicked and died. 
The man he ripped, and cussed, and swore— 
As he gathered a 
big brickbat— 
That he would be durned essentially, 
If he didn't kill that cat! 
But the wonmrt allowed she'd be blest if 1;e did. 
And snatched up an old shot gun, 
'Which she tired and peppered his diaphram, 
With bird shot number one. 
They to ed him home on a 
window blind, 
And the doctors cured him up, 
But he never was known to fight again, 
Or to own another purp. 
Folks may turn up their snoots at this rhyme, 
I 
don't care a 
cuss for that! 
All I 
wanted to show is that fighting dorgs, 
.24Iay tackle the wrong Tem cat.

I 
have been to the North, I 
have been to the South 
But in travling a 
man may afar go 
To the jumping off place before he will find 
A town c•unp tred witn Chicago. 
If you never have altered your name in your life, 
Nor never did up to the bar go. 
Or else run away with another man's wife, 
They won't let you live in Chicago. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! Sodom was some, and Gomorrah was great, 
And in Venice each man was an Iago, 
But nothing out there can a 
moment compare 
With the sweet stat e 
of things in Chicago. 
Some people send on by Adam's Express, 
And some put their faith in a 
Fargo, 
But if you would go to the devil direct, 
You enter yourself at Chicago. 
They won't let a 
clergyman live in the town, 
On such they have put an embargo, 
Unless he drinks sherry with all his young friends, 
And then he may stay in Chicago. 
Oh! Sodom was some, &c. 
I. 
There the infants are fed on whisky direct, 
For liquor they all to their ma 
And the muley co x

man might expect, 
Milk punch in the town of Chicago. 
The town with fast ladies mid gay gamboliers 
Is as full as a 
ship with her cargo, 
And the very best men it is truthfully said, 
Fight cocks in the town of Glicago. 
Oh! Sodom was some, drc. 
There all the small boys played at ' poker' and ' cram,' 
For inot, of them did to the war go, 
All they sin! , that wild song, call -d ' I

All night in the strcets of Chicago.

Who live in the town of Chicago.

THE MERRIEST GIRL THAT'S OUT. 
With laughter and good humor, why, 
I 
pass my time away, 
So, while l'm Inre l'ii do my best 
To please you with my lay. 
Then, come along and join my song, 
And raise a 
merry shout, 
To welcome me : for, I'm you see, 
The merriest girl that's out. 
cnonus. 
Now then, young men, 
Don't be melancholy: 
Just see, like me, 
if you can't be jolly. 
If any thing goes wrong with 111.3, 
I 
never sulk or pout: 
In fact, I 
am, and always was, 
The merriest girl that's out 
The gentlemen complain and say; 
I'm such a 
dreadful flirt: 
But if they will make love to me, 
Their hearts I'm sure to hurt--
I 
really can't help laughing, 
When I 
hear them sigh about; 
For sentiment it don't suit me ; 
I'm the merriest girl that's out. 
Now then, &e, 
The notes and presents I 
receive, 
Would fill a 
basket quite, 
While bouquets rare, I 
do declare, 
Are sent me every night. 
The notes all speak of broken hearts: 
Some mean it, I've no doubt; 
I'm Sorry: vet I 
still remain 
„ 
The merriest girl that's out, 
Now, then, 614. 
To balls and parties I 
oft go: 
For, dancing I 
admire, 
And waltzing is a 
thing, I 
own, 
Of which I 
never tire ; 
And should my partner squeeze my hand, 
I 
know what I'm about: 
It pleases him, and don't hurt me: 
I'm the merriest girl that'a out. 
Now then, die.

THE YALLEIC, GAL THAT WINKED AT ME. 
Music by M. A. 11ERNANDEZ. 
Your attention I 
ask for a -while, 
To a 
song I'm going to sing you, 
It's about a 
pretty yaller gal I 
met while I 
was walking, 
And she threw such a 
glance at me— 
She was pretty and as sweet as a 
flower, 
Such clothes you never did see— 
She'd a 
darling little bonnet with a 
flower-garden on it, 
Had the yaller gal that winked at me. 
CHORUS. 
Oh my! she looked so sweet and she dressed so neat, 
With her tilting-hoops and pretty little feet, 
As she went skipping along. 
Pretty little yaller gal I 
met while I 
was walking, 
As she skipped across the gutter, my heart went in a 
flutter, 
For the yaller gal that winked at me. 
/ 
immediately asked her name, 
And she said it was Lucinda 
She said I 
was a 
stunner, and for life that I 
had won her, 
And married we should be. 
So, I'd dress up, and I'd walk by her house, 
Every afternoon, about three, 
And I'd glance up at the window for to see my dear Lucinda, 
She's the yaller gal that winked me. 
Oh my I 
she looked, &c. 
Oh 1 
you should have seen her, on her wedding day— 
She was handsome as a 
Venus— 
When the Parson made us one, ah then 1 
the thing was done, 
And I 
never felt so happy in my life. 
So, I've bought a 
little place out of town— 
If you go by, stop in and see— 
You'll be welcomed by a 
wife that's as dear to me as life, 
' She's the yeller gal that winked at me. 
Oh my 1 
she looked, &e. 
OUR GRAND-FATHERS' DAYS. 
A 
song for to please all my kind friends before me: 
I've been thinking', of late, a 
new subject to raise, 
And one I've got and I 
know it will please you: 
am going to sing of our grand- fathers' days. 
In our grand fathers' days, men were judged but by merit 
And those who were sound, got their measure of praise; 
But, now-:t 
days, folks judge of men by their money— 
That wasn't the case in our grand-fathers' days. 
In our grand- fathers days they had no patent leathers, 
Garot-choking collar, or no peg tops pants; 
Young men didn't go it with two- forty horses, 
Or visit young ladies, at night at their aunt's, 
The boys didn't then congregate on the corners 
To see the gals crossing, on wet slushy days, 
Nor the gals didn't want a 
policeman to help them— 
That wasn't the style in our grand-fathers' days. 
In our grand-fathers' days, billiard-markers neer sported 
Mustache on their lips, or goatees on their chins, 
Nor did six penny barbers drive out in light wagons, 
Nor did fish-bail waiters wear diamond pins. 
The gals didn't paint, stuff themselves up with cotton, 
They didn't wear hoops, patent bustles or stays, 
Didn't smoke cigarettes, or drink cock-tails at Taylor's: 
That wasn't the style in our grand-fathers' days. 
In our grand fathers' days married men they were steady; 
You'd not find them out every day of their lives, 
Nor see them out, late, walking home with their cousins; 
They always retired in good time to their wives; 
They had no Champagne- suppers, no little flirtations, 
No trying to go it in various ways; 
Didn't stop in saloons with a 
female acquaintance— 
They had no waiter girls in our grand fathers' days. 
In our grand fathers' days, when a 
man ran for office, 
He did it alone for the national good. 
And not for the dollars and cents he ml lit pocket— 
That is something that. now-a-days, ain't understood. 
The Government, then, was for wisdom selected 
Rebellion hadn't set the Country a- blaze; 
But the people have sworn that our Flag shall float over 
The Union that was in our grand-fathers' days!

I MET HER AT THE MATINEE. 
Words and Music by—FRANK HOWARD. 
(Published by ROOT & CADY.] 
My self I 
dre6sed all in my best and with some surpins cash, 
I 
started for the 7Alat-inee I 
thought to cot a 
dash. 
The house was fill'd with beaux and belles as happy as could be, 
And to my coat my heart I 
lost while at the Mat-ince, 
My love had curls and teeth like pearls and wore a 
saucy hat. 
And when she peeped from under it my heart it went pit pat, 
Among the crowd of beauties there no other could I 
see, 
That would compare with her I 
met while at the Mat-inee, 
CTIORUS. 
My love had curls and teeth like pearls and were a 
saucy bat, 
Arid when she peeped from under it my heart it went pit pat. 
Among the crowd of beauties therk, no other could I 
see, 
That Would compare with her I 
met while at the Matinee. 
Along with other pretty boy" just as the play was o'er, 
I 
took a 
good posish to stare closely by the exit door, 
And as my charmer came along 1 
made so bold and free, 
To offor her my company home from the Matinee, 
She took my arm and with an smile, as bright as morning dew. 
She says' my name is Angeline. now pray sir who are you ? 
I 
said ray name was Clarence Charles that she was to me, 
By 0.1r the dearest girl I 
saw while at the Matinee 
My love had curls, &c. 
We strol'd around an hour or more as happy as two birds, 
In telling her my fervent love, there was no lack of words, 
1 
asked if she was free to wed and if she would be mine, 
She answer with cunning leer, " l'll tell some other time, 
Of course we had to have ice cream fruit cake and lemonade, 
Five dollars 1 
was minus by the time the bill was paid. 
Oh ! then I 
saw her safely home and there she promised me, 
Without a 
doubt next Wednesday she d 
be at the Matinee 
My love had curls, d:c. 
We kept up our flirtation often meeting after that, 
Until one day I 
saw her home, oh I 
did not I 
feel flat, 
As at the door a 
man we met, my husband dear ' says she, 
This is a 
nice young man I 
met while at the Matinee, 
I 
MET, [coNcLunim]. 
My heart felt like a 
piece of lead, I 
thought that I 
should choke 
The husband says " my darling wife so loves a 
little joke." 
Of course I 
tried to laugh the joke I 
could not see, 
And now I 
shun the girls I 
meet while at the Matinee. 
CHORUS. 
Now all young men of good advice, just take a 
word or two, 
In forming new acquaintances be careful what you do, 
Dont let your charmers steal your heart until you plainly see, 
That they'r not like that girl I 
met while at the Matinee. 
FORTUNE IN TEE FIRE. 
Sweet Norah, come here, and look into the fire, 
Perhaps in its embers good look we may see; 
Don't come too near, or your glances so burning, 
Will put it clean out, like the sunbeams, machree. 
Just look 'tween the bars, where the black sod is smoking, 
There'S a 
sweet little valley, with rivers and trees. 
And a 
house on the bank quite as good as the squire's, 
Who knows but some day we'll have something like these 
Who knows but some day we'll have something like these? 
And now there's a 
coach with four galloping horses, 
A 
coachman to drive, and a 
footman behind, 
That shows that some day we will keep a 
fine carriage, 
And fly through the street at the speed of the wind. 
As. Dermot was speaking, the rain drops came hissing 
Down thro' the wide chimney, the fire went out; 
While mansion and river, and horses and carriage, 
All vanished in smoke- wreaths that whirl'd about, 
All vanished in smoke- wreaths that whiad. about. 
Then Norah to Dermot this speech softly whispered, 
" *Twere better to do than to idly desire; 
. 
And one little cot by the roadside is better 
Than a 
palace with servants and coach in the fire, 
Than a 
palace with servants and coach in the fire." 
I COULDN'T HELP LAUGHING, I.. 
TICKLED ME SO. 
Vrom morning till night I'm indulging in mirth, 
l've always been so from the day of my birth ; 
I 
grin like a 
Maltese cat all thro' each dav, 
And never feel right unless laughing away. 
My infantile actions were certainly wild— 
All folks said I 
was a 
most wonderful chi1J; 
And when first short-coated, Fa have you to know, 
I 
couldn't help laughing, it tickled me so. 
moans. 
IIat ha! ha I 
ha! ho! ho! ho! hot 
I 
couldn't help laughing, it tickled me so. 
And when, by degrees, I 
had reached man's estate, 
I 
then looked about in search of a 
mate, 
My eyes soon I 
set on a 
girl tall and fair, 
And begg'd that my heart and my home she would share 
And while so persistently urging my claim, 
She gave her consent, and at last the day came ; 
But, when in the morning to church we aid go, 
I 
couldn't help laughing, it tickled me so. 
I'm fond of a 
game, I'm a 
good one to chaff; 
At all kinds of mischief Fm n 
certain to laugh 
I 
oft play a 
lark on some innocent elf, 
Nor care though the laugh should be turned 'gainst myself. 
I 
once, walking out, saw a 
man in a 
fit, 
To make him come round I 
his ear quickly bit; 
And when he jumped up, knock'd me down with one blow. 
I 
couldn't help laughing, it tickled me so. 
Ha, ha, etc. 
My landlord once called for hi 
But I 
couldn't pay it because 
So off to a 
broker he went 
And vowed he would sei 
Before he could get ha 
For I 
shot the moon, 
And tho' plac'd in • 
I 
couldn't help la

two quarters' rent, 
it was spent; 
very quick, 
Le upon every stick. 
k, I 
gave him leg bail, 
but got caught, put in jail; 
'limbo" for what I 
did owe, 
ughing, it tickled me so. 
Three times in succession my partner had twins— 
My place to look like a 
small school-room begins; 
Throughout all the day there is nothing but glee, 
For all of them have laughing fits just like me. 
The last time, to add to our family joys, 
To me three presented, a 
girl and two boys; 
Whet I 
saw the three cherubs all of a 
row, 
I 
couldn't help laughing, it tickled me so. 
Ha, ha, etc. 
Ha, ha, etc. 
A
:-" Beautiful Bells." 
Don't talk to me, it's quite absurd, 
Of dashing fellows' please; 
I'll never listen to a 
word, 
But think you mean to tease; 
Although in V 
heart is broken quite 
It goes on'neating still, 
For one I 
loved with all might, 
ly be-eutiful, my Bill. 
(Wlusn,E)--Be-eutiful Bill was a 
beautiful beau, 
Beautiful Billy who bother'd me so: 
Sweetest of Will 
adorable Will, 
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful Bill. 
'Twas at a 
ball I 
met my Bill, 
lie made the neatest bow, 
He squeezed my hand in a 
quadrille, 
And went on anyhow : 
Ile praised my toilet, thought it neat, 
As we walked to and fro ; 
The things he said were very sweet; 
But then his waltzing, oh 
Be-eutiful 
The waltzing done, be said " my love, 
This balcony is nice," 
And then, oh! foolish, fluttering dove, 
I 
let him kiss me twice ; 
And though I 
said, " Please let me go," 
Resistance was in vain, 
His lips were very near, and so 
I-I-I 
kissed him back again! 
Be-eutiful Bill, &C. 
Ile promised we should meet next day, 
Whatever did befall, 
And so we did— up North-west-way, 
The Zo-o-lo-gi-cal. 
'Twas in the Parrot-house that Bill 
Proposod a 
little walk, 
For pretty Poly-syllables, 
To hear the parrots talk. 
Be-eutiful Bill, &LI 
The chatt'ring Parrots made a 
din, 
Enough to drive one wild, 
I 
didlit notice coining in, 
A lady and her child; 
Bill blushed, and though he look'd confused, 
With all the cheek in life— 
The lady then he introduced 
As Mrs. Brown, his wife. 
Be-eutiful Bill, Sze 
With hopes all crushed and tumbled down, 
I 
stagger'd to the door, 
And murinur'd faintly, " Mrs. Brown, 
I've heard that name before!" 
And that is why I'm single now, 
And shall be so until 
Some future day, when perhaps I 
may 
Take up another Bill. 
SPoKF's.—And the next one must bo a superior article without en-
cumbrances, quiet to drive in double harness, in fact—

M ARTHA, 
THE MILKMAN'S DAUGHTER. 
The object that you now behold 
Once loved a 
darling fairy, 
In the shape of a 
blue-eyed, fair-haired girl, 
Whose father kept a 
dairy. 
Not far from the middle of the Harlem Road, 
how well I 
knew it rather, 
She lived with her daddy, a 
cross old buffer, 
And my loved one's name was Martha. 
SPCA: 
Weet Martha. 
CHORUS. 
Alt ! I 
once was as happy as a 
young cock robin, 
Or the pretty little fishes in the water ; 
Those days are gone, for now I 
mourn 
For Martha, the milkman's daughter. 
She served the milk in hap'orths and peinfort. 
From the bottom of a 
bl,wk-tin pail ; 
The only cow her father kept 
Was the one with an iron tail, 
And thAt vas kept in the little back 
against the whitewashed wall, 
It. always yielded plenty of— 
Well, I 
musn't tell you all.

Ah! I 
once, & c. 
When the cld boy used to " walk his chalks," 
'Twits then I'd call on Martha ; 
I 
loved the very ground she trod, 
But I'd strong objections to her father. 
Unexpected he one day returned, 
And upon me placed a 
cheek, 
For he nearly shook toe inside out, 
And vowed he'd break my neck. 
S,aoKEN.—The brute !

once, (tc. 
MARTHA , 
THE MILKMAN'S DAUGHTER. 
[CONCLUDED.] 
Then I 
used to wander near the house, 
In hopes my love to see, 
She'd take a 
survey from the second floor front, 
In hopes that she'd see me. 
One day she threw a" billet doux," 
Which made my blood turn cold— 
Her daddy demanded that she should wed 
An old codger with lots of gold. 
SPOKEN.—The mot of all evil! 
Alt! I 
once, &c. 
In time the wedding day arrived, 
When she was to be bound 
To a 
rich old fool she couldn't love, 
But the bride could not be found ! 
They searched the house and scoured the streets, 
When at last they did discover 
A note to say that she'd gone away, 
To die for her true lover. 
SPOKM—And that was me! 
Alt ! I 
once, efc. 
Next morning in the pure, bright Hudson, 
IIer lovely form was found, 
With all her clothes in such a 
mess, 
IIer darling self she'd drowned. 
From the horrible effects of sugar of lead 
Tier daddy died that night, 
And the verdict the coroner's inquest found, 
Was—" It served the old fool right !" 
SPOKEN.—And so it did 
Ah! I 
once, dc. 
In the middle of the night I 
jnmp upright, 
For I 
dream such dreams while sleeping, 
That the ghost of Martha, dressed in white, 
Comes to my bedside weeping. 
Without that lovely sky-blue maid, 
I 
neer can be a 
liver; 
If I 
knew how to swim, or wasn't afraid, 
I'd throw myself in the river I

P1TLLING HARD AGAINST THE STREAM. 
[CONCLUDED.] 
Many a 
bright, good-hearted fellow, 
Many a 
noble-minded man, 
Finds himself in water shallow ; 
Then, assist him, if you can. 
Some succeed at every turning, 
Fortune favors every scheme, 
Others, too—tho' more deserving, 
Have to pull against the stream. 
So then, do your best, cte. 
If the wind is in your favor, 
And you've weathered every squall, 
Think of those who luckless labor, 
Never get fair winds at all: 
Working hard, contented, willing, 
Struggling thro' life's ocean wide; 
Not a 
friend, and not a 
shilling, 
Pulling hard against the tide. 
So then, do your best, .to. 
Don't give way to foolish sorrow, 
Let this keep you in good cheer; 
Brighter days may come to-morrow, 
If you try and persevere; 
Darkest nights will have a 
morning, 
Tho' the sky be overcast; 
Lono-est h:neg must have a 
turning, 
And the tide will turn at last. 
So then, ao your best,

THE ROLLICKING RAMS. 
Button up your waistcoat, button up your shoos, 
have another liquor and throw away the blues, 
Be like me and good for a 
spree. 
From now till the day is dawning, 
For I 
am a 
member of the rollicking rams, 
Come and be a 
member of the rollicking rams, 
The only boys to make a 
noise, 
From now till the day is dawning. 
We scorn 3uch drinks as lemonade, Soda, seltzer, beer. 
The liquors of our club I'd tell to you, 
But I 
can't, for there's ladies here. 
Come along, come along, come along, 
CHORUS. 
For I 
am a 
member of the rollicking rams, 
Come and be a 
member of the rollicking rams; 
Out all night till broad daylight, 
And never go home till morning! 
When once you're a 
member of the rollicking rams, 
All things real, we have no shams, 
Except Cliampagae, good Champagne, 
We drink till the day is dawning ; 
In all the pockets of the rollicking r 
ms, 
Each one puts a 
bottle of Chant. 
And on some doorstep sit and drink, 
Till daylight in the morning. 
With a 
pocket full of money the Police make right, 
To what we do they're blind, 
Such as pulling down bells and breaking lamps, 
For which we should be fined, 
Come along, come along, come along. 
For I 
am a, &c. 
The Milkman in the morning he knows us rams, 
We follow up behind him and empty the cans, 
Which down the area he has put, 
For breakfast in the morning. 
Upset a 
coffee stall as we go home, 
With us our landladies pick a 
bone, 
And get kicked out of house and home, 
'Without a 
moment's warning; 
But we don't care we're single men, 
ltiot hampered with a 
wife. 
So now my friends if you like the style, 
Come and spend a 
noisy life, 
Come along, come along, come along, 
For I 
am a, ite.

TRT1 MOUSE-TRAP MAN. 
As Sung in the Burlesque of " Pluto," by M ISS A LICE DUNELVL 
Kind friends in me you an object behold, 
Wounded in feelgs, and minus his heart. 
I 
lov'd a 
girl, but by her I've been sold, 
All for a 
mouse- trap man spicy and smart'. 
Outside her door loudly bawling he'd go • 
" 
Mouse-
traps a 
penny" thrd -out all the day. 
In her good graces, he soon got, I 
know, 
Caught her with " mouse-traps" and stole her away 
CHORUS. 
'Mouse-traps, mouse- traps,' he'd cry, 
• 
Mouse- traps, fine mouse- traps' who'll buy ? 
Strong as a 
house, just have one and try, 
Mouse-traps a 
penny, a 
penny, who'll buy ?" 
In a 
dark corner this trap she did fix, 
Baited each hook with a 
piece of burnt cheese, 
Woke up next morning and there she found six 
Poor little mouses as dead as you please 
When she diskivered ' em, she cried ` 0 
lor, 
Never before was the like seen of sitch, 
Him as brought that ere m > usetrap to the door, 
l'm sure he's a 
conjuror, leastways a 
witch.' 
Mousetraps, mousetraps, &c. 
No more cold wittles I 
got from that day, 
All of her perkisites' went to that chap, 
When I 
asked for 'em, she used for to say, 
As how she wanted 'em to bait the trap. 
'That may be true,' said I, 
but, ' p'raps you'll tell, 
Where are the governor's left off suits 
You must have them for you know very well, 
They don't bait mousetraps with old trousers and boots! 
Mousetraps, mousetraps, &c. 
She kick'd me out, slamm'd the door in my face, 
Sent me adrift with a 
fle-a 
in my ear, 
She'd guy me • turnips,' and it was a 
case,' 
I 
was outrivalled by that chap, 'twas clear, 
LAst Sun ay week they were man and wife made, 
Which fill'd 
bunom with .frief, care and woe ; 
Now they are doing a 
fine roaring trade, 
For mousetraps a 
penny,' they both brawling do go. 
Mousetraps, mousetraps, & c.

That my costume is quite comme

You'll observe that my watch has been left with a

There are traces of wear on my elbows and knees, 
And my boots have run down at the heel;

When a 
man has grown Shabby Genteel.

And I 
bear my bad luck like a

If I

I 
must still do the best that I 
can; 
And remember, good people, that Fortune some day, 
By a

May reduce one of you in the very same way, 
To the level of Shabby Genteel.

THE CAT IN THE CORNER. 
As Sung by Bryant's Minstrels. 
Och. I 
weep for the day when we were torn from our cot, 
Our praties and meal and our stirabout pot, 
When Judy kept everything piping and hot, 
So snug with the cat in the corner. 
The pigs and tha dogs with the children agree, 
Lay down on the floor so decent with straw, 
While the rooster and hen sat perched up avak, 
Right over the cat in the corner. 
Our cabin was tidily covered with thatch, 
It looked like a 
harlequin's coat patch for patch, 
And the door opened nately by rising the latch, 
Wid a 
thong that hung down in the cornet'. 
With scythe stuck up here and a 
reaping hook there, 
And Paddy's shelalah, the pride of the fair, 
Was stuck in the chimney to season with care, 
Right over the cat in the corner. 
Our windows so clean by an unlucky stroke, 
had three of the prettiest panes in it broke, 
And we fastened up two with a 
tail of a 
coat, 
And the smoke went through one in the corner. 
Our dresser was dressed in litigant style, 
The trenchers and noggins, your heart 'twould Leguile, 
While the goose she sat hatching her eggs all the while 
Along with the ea, 
in 
corner

As I 
st,pped out up the Broadway; 
I 
walked up to a 
lamp-lizhter, 
The mystery for to unravel, 
His hair was cut short. like a 
fighter, 
So I 
shouldered my bundle and travelled. 
CHORUS. 
Hurrah for the stars and the stripes, 
And the land where we never sr.e fogs,

l'd been di.,.ging up tuif in the bogs 
Shure the road it was dirty and sloppy, 
Until I 
came to a 
street they call Wall, 
A blackguard shouted, there goes a 
Croppy. 
Whin I 
kim to the big City Hall, 
I 
axed a 
Date I barber the way; 
He answered me dunder and blitzen, 
And a 
big old fat Yankee stepped out, 
And made me an American citizen. 
Hurrah for the Stars, &o 
The first time I 
wint out to Chicago, 
The weather it was very warm 
The Commissioners axed me if I'd go 
And settle upon a 
nice farm. 
No, says I, I'll go back to New-York, 
Where the Politicks they are so pretty, 
Lave your Dutchmen stop here and work, 
But be jabers

And swore that none should dance with Poll, 
There at the fancy ball.

While Pompey Smash he shook his fist, 
With vengeance in his eye;

Away went Pomp with Polly Ann, 
The gayest of them all.

Pomp cleaned the gemmen's clothes, 
And Polly shouted: Hot corn! where

And you'll see them here no more, 
Cause Pompey's made his fortune, 
And has gone to Baltimore. 
Now, strike up, &o. 
AN ORIGINAL SONG. 
You have heard of Teddy Regan, 
How he won his Winnie fair, 
And her fortune, fifty guineas, 
Set them up in business rare. 
For they crossed the briny ocean 
To deal out the whiskey swate 
At the famed hotel d'Irish 
Down in lovely Baxter strate.

Things kept working brave and hearty— 
Proving money makes the man— 
'Till the Dimycrathic party 
Put Ted up for alderman. 
Misther Regan felt the honor 
With a 
relish of delight, 
And resolved to give a 
swario 
When it came election night. 
Fal de ral, 
With the strongest kinds of welcomes 
Rue de Baxter did abound; 
For throughout that lovely section 
Dimycrats are aisy found: 
There was Levi, the old do' man, 
Smelling like the days of yore, 
And 31cTurk, a 
fine Dead Rabbit, 
True and honest to the core. 
Fal de ral, 
Dan McCraisy, licensed vender,

Soon the whiskey done its duty— 
Wall Eyed Bill began the job, 
And with his black-thorn shillaley

There was feathers on a

Soon they knocked the bar to splinters, 
Kicked the panels from the door; 
For it was a

While the whiskey -flowed galore.

With the poker got a

By the howly mine murther, 
Banged his sivin sinses out.

When the styles are on the street, 
People driving up and down, 
Lots of pretty chaps we meet, 
Gaily dressed from toe to crown, 
But the sweetest time, you know, 
When we're gayest of the gay, 
Is while toddling to and fro, 
Coming from the matinee. 
SPORT:N.—Delightful! Kids on—smiling and doing our very 
prettiest—there's nothing so pleasant as 
CHORUS. 
Corning from the matinee, 
Coining from the matinee. 
Don't you think its very gay— 
Coming from the matinee? 
Coming frem the matinee, 
Coming from the matinee ? 
Don't you think it's very gay— 
Coming from the matinee, 
Lovely belles are laughing then, 
Handsome chaps are laughing too, 
Parted hands can meet again 
While the crowd we're passing thro",. 
Some one meets us at the door— 
Very pleasant words he'll say; • 
I 
could linger evermore 
Coming from the- matinee. 
SrorEN.—Everyone 
oks at you so 
But then, you know, 
ladies don't object to being admired, when they an got up re. 
gardless, as they always are when— 
Coming from the matinee, 
Coming from the matinee,

Don't you think it's very gay— 
Coming from the matinee ?, 
Coming from the matinee, &c. 
Once I 
had a 
handsome beau, 
And he loved me very dear— 
For he often told me so, 
Many hundred times'a year 
Everywhere he followed me, 
And of course we met one day--
Just as sweet as he could be, 
Coming from the matinee. 
SPOKEN,—W hy, Willie, how do you do? where have you been/ 
Why, darling, (that's what Willie said) didn't you see me ? When 
We met, I 
was— 
Coming from the matinee, 
Coming from the matinee, 
Dont you think its very gay— 
Coming from the matinee ? 
Coming from the matinee, stc. 
Side by side we wandered on, 
And again he told his love; 
Shall I 
own my heart was won, 
When he called me little dove? 
When he begged his fate 
share, 
Really, now, what could I 
say ? 
Yes, he " popped the question" there, 
Coming from the matinee. 
SroREN.—Of course it wasn 
exactly the proper place to ask & 
lady's hand; but I 
don't think I 
shall ever regret the day Willie 
:met me— 
Coming from the matinee, 
Coming from the matinee, 
Dont you think it's very gay—

THE DUTCHMAN'S SLATE,. 
Ant—." Enoch Arden." 
Kind friends, you was listen, I 
told 7-ai one story 
What happened to me, here, one da. 
I 
keep of this city a 
lager-bier saloon, 
And I 
think of that business will pay. 
But my lager run out, and my Switzer-Kase, too, 
And I 
found out, when it has been too late, 
Of you want to make money in this kind of business, 
By dam! you must nat keep a 
slate. 
My friend, Gasper Hunt, he called on me one day„ 
And asked me for em n 
glass of bier: 
ne drink that, andsaid: It was bully I 
anudder, 
And then rubs his belly—right here. 
He called for more lager, and Switzer-Kase, too ; 
And then he said: That 11 as, first rate! 
When I 
ask him for pay, he do so—mit his; eye, 
And told me : Put that car the slate. 
Now, I 
don't like that business and so I 
was told hirx,, 
One day, when he came mit my store, 
And there I 
silly Gasper a- drinking mine lager, 
And huggin' my wife mit the doar : 
I 
take him shnst so, mit the slack of his breeches, 
And pitch him right oat on his head: 
I 
take down that slate, and I 
break up that business, 
And den, ten tausend II was mad. 
OLD SARAH WALKER. 
Kind friends, I'm clad to see you all, 
suppose you don't know me, 
But who I 
am I'll very quickly mention, 
And before I 
go away I 
mean to have my say, 
That is if you will give me your attention. 
You've no need to be told that I 
am growing old. 
And at this time of life I 
am no talker, 
But listen, unto me, and you will plainly see 
The opinions of old Sarah Waller. 
How many of our poor, who beg from door to door, 
Are wanting clothing, food and even shelter. 
And if without a 
bed, they should sleep beneath a 
shed, 
They're hurried oft to prison hater skelter. 
There's no denying- that the convicts do get fat, 
They prefer a 
jail or workhouse, and they ought to ; 
While they treat the poor so had, and the criminals so well, 
We shan't be wanting for thieves, says Sarah Walker. 
Of }reload. I 
must say, we've found out in our day, 
That there's not a 
nation truer, tir yet bolder, 
For their hearts are warm, I'll prove, and the girls, oh, can't 
they love. 
And she's brought forth many a 
statesman and a 
soldier. 
There's one that's long been gone, I 
mean Emmet, Ireland's son, 
Who to a 
proud nation proved a 
baulker. 
Long may old Ireland be the emerald of the sea, 
And prosperity be her's, says Sarah Walker.

SONG OF THE FARMER. 
"I have cattle that feed in the valley, 
And herds that graze on the hill. 
And I 
pride in the fruits of my labor 
For, I'm lord of the land that I 
till. 
I 
have plow'd the rough hill and the meadow, 
Till feeble with age and with toil, 
And I 
know before long that another 
Shall reap the new fruits of the soil. 
For, the son that bath toil'd for me ever, 
And faithfully stood by my side, 
Hatt' a 
hand flint shall gather the harvest, 
When his feeble old father bath died. 
c
And the daughter so kind to her mother 
I Shall share with him all I 
possess ; 
• 
For, I 
feel that they love me as father, 
And welcome my tender caress. 
There's my faithful, my trusting companion, 
My kind-hearted, dear loving wife, 
I 
have toiled for her comfort with pleasure; 
For, such was the pride of my life. 
And still in my manhood I 
love her, 
For her kind and affectionate care, 
And all that the earl' can afford me, 
With her I 
most willingly share.

TELE TILT SKEItT: 
Air, " Charming Young Widow." 
While walking down Broadway, one morning, and thinking, 
Of the funny creations which Fashion, has bred, 
As shown by the - Pancakes," the " Suudowns„' the " Gypsies," 
And all the queer things the girls wear on their bead, 
I 
saw " Waterfalls," " " Rats," " Mice." and cheek "Pltlinpairs 
Worn by maids, wives and widows, and dashing young flirts,. 
But, nothin r 
so much took my eye or my Miley, 
As those kiing, enchanting, suggestive Tilt 
kirts..• 
While thinking, before me, I 
saw, what a 
Spare, 
My eyes were entranc'd, I 
was dumb with surpriB0, 
She 
the waist of a 
Venus 
i a 
bust fit for Juno, 
And the wickedest, killingest kind of black eyesI 
She smil'd, such a 
smile! as before a 
shop window, 
She stoppd, first to peep— if was on the alert, 
And as gracefully forward, she stoopd for a 
moment, 
I 
saw such a 
sight 
Oh, that blessed Tilt Skirt. 
What a 
foot! 
What an ankle! 
They set my heart bumping!' 
Oh, how my month water'd, as she onward sped, 
And I 
follow'd, panting, and hoping and fearing, 
With a 
thousand wild thoughts rushing through my poor head. 
When, all of a 
sudden she dashd in a 
doorway, 
And up stairs, she tripp'd—I hope 'twas not pert 
But who could restrain his eyes from then feasting, 
On all twas reveal'd by that blessed Tilt Skirt! 
What a 
foot! 
What a 
gaiter 1 
an ankle, oh, dear me, 
It Quite drives me mad, but to think of it now, 
And then what a 
leg! spann'd by such a 
sweet gaitert 
I 
felt. quite all over, I 
cannot tell how t 
I 
waited, how could I 
leave a 
feast so enchanted, 
Five long minutes pass'd and still on the alert, 
I 
saw her come down, and at each step she tilted, 
And I 
fairly wilted! oh, that Inessed Tilt Skirt. 
For a 
moment I 
stood without power to follow, 
As she daintily tripp'd along, over the " Russ," 
But soon summoned courage, and caught up with my charmer, 
Just as she her fingers held up for a 
bus! 
it stopped. 
The door opend. Her dry goods she lifted, 
I 
stood in the rush, unmindful of hurt. 
Ye gods! what a 
heaven to my eyes was then open'd1 
As once more sho tilted, that blessed Tilt Skirt! 
I 
rushed in behind her, a 
seat took beside her, 
At the end of the street she rose to go out, 
And I 
rose as well, I 
was in such a 
fever 
That really I 
knew not what I 
was about! 
1 
follow'd her, spoke; she blush'd, I 
insisted 
On seeing her home, and she prov'd no flirt— 
For she quickly consented. and I've never repented 
The day that I 
first saw that blessed Tilt Skirt.

Bear me, ye light dancing billows,

Whisper love-songs to the breeze!

Over each valley and hill, 
Blissrully I

Lull'd by some murmuring rill 
In that far land the sun, shining, 
Burns with a 
soft, subdued light; 
Then the soul never is pining, 
For the cool stillness of night. 
Zephyrs of p.tradise, sighing, 
Sing to the trees a 
sweet strain, 
Whilst angel voices replying, 
Murmur the cadence again !

41: 
ON SPRINGFIELD " MOUNTING." 
Copied from " The Squibob Papers." 
On Springfield " Mounting" there did dwell, 
A 
likely youth, I 
knowed him well. 
Leftenant Carter's only sou, 
A comely youth nigh twenty-one. 
On Monday morning he did go, 
Into the meadow for to mow, 
And all ter once he filar did feel, 
A 
pizen sarpeut bite his heel. 
Quick as he felt the sarpent bite, 
lie raised his scythe with all his might, 
He strick ter once a 
deadly blow, 
That laid the pizen creature low. 
He tuk the ryptile in his hand, 
And straight he went to Molly Bland: 
Ohl Molly, Molly, here you see 
A 
pizen sarpent what bit me. 
Zerubabah why did you go, 
Inter the meadow for to mow? 
Ohl Molly Bland, I 
thought you knowed, 
'Mass father's field and must be mowed. 
Then Molly Bland she squatted down, 
And sucked p'zen from the wound; 
But oh! she had a 
rotten tooth, 
The venial soon affected bothe. 
Oh! then they war all spotted o'er, 
With all the colors the sarpent wore; 
They laid 'em both upon a 
bed, 
And they swelled up and di-i-ded. 
THE STANDARD BEARER. 
Upon the tented field a 
Minstrel Knight, 
Beside his standard lonely watch was keeping, 
And thus, amid the stillness of the night, 
He strikes his lute, while all around is sleeping--
CHORUS. 
The lady of my love— I 
will not name, 
Although I 
wear her colors as a 
token, 
For I 
would fight for liberty and fame, 
Beneath the flag where first our vows were spoken. 
The night is past, the conflict's come with dawn, 
The Minstrel Knight has seen its fortifying ; 
'Midst death and carnage onward still are borne-
- 
His song is beard ' midst thousands aroundheitn
,t;c.
dy 
The lady of my 
lov  
Stern Death now sated quits the gory plain ; 
The life blood from the Warrior Bard is streaming, 
While on his flag he rests his hand with pain. 
And faintly sines— his eyes with fervor beaming. 
The lady of my love I 
will not name ; 
I'll still retain her colors as a 
token ; 
I've fought and fell for lib* rty and fame, 
And never have our knightly vows been broken. 
VIVA L'AMERICA.

Noble Republic

Throughout the world our motto shall be--
Viva l'America, home of the free!

Exile his heritage, his name a

COUNTY JAIL. 
Good people, all give ear I 
pray, and mark ye all to what- I 
sayi 
To my misfortunes, great and small, come listen and I'll tell yo* 
all: 
I 
used to lead a 
glorious life, devoid of care, devoid of strife; 
Could go to bed and fall asleep, no ugly visions around me creep— 
But, oh I 
the toots and Cupid gods, they nearly drove me ramp-
ing mad, 
They piped into a 
railroad mail and carried me off to the County 
Jail! 
And when we got to the end of the route, the turnkey turned my 
pockets out, 
To see if I 
had got such stuff as money, grub, tobacco, or snuff; 
They took me in to try my size, the color of hair, the color of 
eyes— 
They measured me up from root to lip, to see if I 
had but one'top 
lip; 
Then straightway to the yard did go and ordered me a 
suit of 
clothes, 
The kyds came out and did me hail; " Another new cove for 
County Jail I" 
Then one of them, with a 
roguish leer, says. " My 
jolly old cove, 
what brought you here I" 
'What do you think brought me out, what brought me here but 
your railroad route? 
Then they gathered around me like so many fools, and one talked 
about the Hales, 
That each new comer should sing a 
scng, or tell a 
tale-God knows 
how long— 
Or they'd break his wind and give him a 
whack, or they'd take 
him down to Black Jack, 
From there they wollop him, tooth and nail, with an old wet 
towel from County Jail 
As I 
walked out and strolled the yard, thinking my 
case was won, 
drous hard, 
All at once I 
heard a 
din, the deputy warden shouts " All in -' 
Then lumbering down the yard we go, like beasts let out of a 
wild beast show— 
COUNTY JAIL.—[CONCLIIDED.j 
Some cracked in mind, and some in wind, and others with a 
creel; 
behind; 
Then one by one we march around the tub to get our county 
allowance of grub, 
Which blew our ribs out like a 
sail with a 
skilly and whack from 
County Jail 1 
At five o'clock one of them said; " It is nearly time to go to bed :" 
The truth from him T 
-cound did creep, for all turned in and went 
to sleep. 
The turnkey bawled as stiff as starch: " Right about face and 
then quick march !" 
We did, and made such a 
rush like monkeys marching around a 
bush. 
Such clanking of clogs, such shaking of knees, such croaking of 
bellys, and clanking of keys, 
Such damning beds as hard as a 
nail, they'd starve a 
poor devil 
in County Jail! 
At six next morning up we got, each man was called to clean his 
pot, 
Then through the yard we did lurch, all fell in lino to go to 
church; 
And there such dresses as met my view, one arm was red, the 
other was blue— 
One leg was yellow, the other was gray, and then the parson be-
gan to pray. 
He said that Elijah went up in a 
cloud, and Lazarus walked about 
in his shroud, 
And that Jonah he lived inside of a 
whale, a d—d 
sight better 
than County Jail! 
Service being over, we all got back, and fell in line for skilly and 
whack; 
We crushed like pigs all in a 
lump—at nine each took his hand at 
pump. 
At ten we raised a 
glorious mill, and smothered each other with 
right good will! 
At eleven we raised it and quit the house, all fell in line for pans 
of skouse. 
Then if there's a man, no matter how droll, we pop him into 
Pompies hole, 
Where whack and water-cocks his tail, there's glorious times in 
County Jail/

DEAREST 'STAY, 
0! niggers come and listen, a 
story 
relate, 
It happened in a 
valley in de ole Carolina state: 
It was down in de meadow I 
used to make de hay, 
I 
always work de harder when I 
tink on you, dear May. 
CHORUS, 
Oh 
dearest May, you're lovelier dan de day, 
Your eyes so bright dey shine at night, 
When de moon am gone away. 
My massa gib me holiday, I 
wish he'd gib me more, 
I 
thanked him very kindly as I 
pushed my boat from shore. 
And down de ribber paddled,wid a 
heart so light and free, 
To de cottage ob my lovely May, I 
long'd so much to see. 
Oh! dearest May, tte. 
On de bank oh de ribber where de trees dey hang so low, 
When de coon among de branches play, and de mink he keeps 
below. 
Oh dar is de spot: and May she looks so sweet, 
Her eyes dey sparkle like de stars, and her lips am red as beet. 
Oh 1 
dearest May, &c. 
Beneath the shady ole oak tree I've sot for many an hour, 
As happy as de buzzard bird dat sports among de flowers; 
But dearest May, I 
left her, and she cried when both we parted, 
I 
gib her a 
long and farewell kiss, and back to massa started. 
Ohl dearest May, dm 
NOT FOR SOSEPII. 
I've seen a 
bit of gaiety throughout my short career, 
I, once, was foolish with my tin, but I've paid most dear, 
If folks would seek to take me in, they find it is no go; 
I'm up to almost every thing: You can't get over Joe. 
c 
FIORLTS. 
Oh! dear, no! not for Joe—if he knows it—not for Joseph. 
Oh 1 
no, no! not for Joe 
not for Joseph—oh! dear, no 1 
The other day, I 
met a 
friend, we passed the time of day, 
And chatted gaily down Broadway: but ere I 
went away, 
I 
kindly asked the learned swell te take a 
parting drain, 
Oh! yes, said he, I 
think I 
will: then let it be champagne. 
Spoken.—No, you, don't, my dear felTow, you don't get 
champagne out of Joseph. 
Oh 1 
dear, no, not I &c. 
Some time ago, a 
friend of mine, he asked me ont to dine, 
And there he introduced me to one he called divine: 
He said she'd make a 
charming wife, and had such lots of tin: 
A widow only -forty-two: go in, my boy, and win. 
Spoken.—Matrimony and lots of money, and a 
widow only 
forty-two—well, the money is very good, but then—the widow. 
Oh! dear, no, not 1 
ac. 
Of late, in town, there was a 
fuss about the Japs so grand: 
And, also, of the Russians who visited our land, 
And the country-companies we greeted with hearty cheers, 
We know they have been received well by the New York 
Volunteers. 
Spoken,- -What a 
glorious thing it is to fight and die for 
your country! 
What can be more glorious than a 
bullet in 
your eye ? 
What can be more painful than a 
bullet in the 
eye ? 
Nothing I 
should think— 
Oh I 
dear, no, not 1 &e. 
And now, perhaps, I've sung my song, you might be in the 
cue, 
To show you kind acknowledgement, but that with me won't 
do, 
As for to-night I've done my best. and that you ought to know: 
Su, if you want a 
song again, don't try it on with Joe 1
