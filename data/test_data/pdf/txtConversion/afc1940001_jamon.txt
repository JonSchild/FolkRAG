Foreman MonroeCome all you brave , young shanty boys, a tale [to?] you I'll relate,Concerning a
young riverman and his untimely fate;Concerning a young riverman, so manly, true and brave,'Twas
on a jam on Gerry's Rock where he met his watery grave.'Twas on a Sunday morning, as you will
quickly hear.Our logs were piled up mountain high, we could not keep them clear.Then up stepped
our young foreman, said, "Who'll volunteer to goAnd break the jam on Gerry's Rock with your
foreman, Young Monroe?"Now some of them were willing, while others they were not,For to work
on Sunday they did not think they'd ought.But six of these bold rivermen did volunteer to goAnd
break the jam on Gerry's Rock with their foreman, Young Monroe.Now, they had not cleared off
many logs when they heard his clear voice say,"I'd have you boys be on your guard, for the jam will
soon give way."These words he'd scarcely spoken when the jam did break and go,Taking with it six
of these brave boys and their foreman, Young Monroe.Now, when these other shanty boys, the
sad news came to hear,They all pulled for the river, for Gerry's Rock did steer,Where six of those
brave rivermen a-floating down did go;While crushed and bleeding on the bank lay their foreman,
Young Monroe.They lifted him from his watery grave, brushed back his raven hair;There was one
form among them whose cries did rend the air,One fair form among them, a girl from Saginaw
town,Whose cries rose to the misty skies for her lover who'd gone down.Fair Clara was the lady's
name, the riverman's true friend,Who with her aged mother lived at the river's bend.She was to wed
young Monroe some sunny day in May,And the boys made up a generous sum and gave to them
next day.
