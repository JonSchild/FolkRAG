along with the " Banker's Daughter" should not be "Led 
Astray by " Fritz," when " My Partner" came along with

You have seen white folks that were hierlitoned, 
But we leave them in the shade, 
We always grab on the latest style, 
Of the finest clothes that's made.

FIRST LOVER: 
I've just come here to see my love, 
She's just inside the door, 
To me she'll ever prove true 
And faithful evermore. 
I 
hear there is another chap 
That always comes around, 
If ever I 
get a 
hold of him, 
His head will kiss the ground. 
CHORUS. 
He'd better go it rather slow, 
Or I'll catch him on the fly, 
For this is what I 
want to know, 
Who gets her, him or I. 
SECOND LOVER: 
I 
wonder who that fellow is 
Comes loafing round about, 
I'll assassinate him you can bet, 
If I 
can find him out. 
He comes to see the girl I 
love, 
He thinks he's very shy, 
But I'll go in, I 
want to know 
Who gets her, him or I.

Now tell me how you come to go 
To see this gal of mine, 
SECOND LOVER: 
Don't talk so sassy to me now, 
This isn't any time, 
FIRST LOVER: 
She says she won't have either one, 
So, come now, let us fly. 
SECOND LOVER • 
And let us be friends, for surely we 
Don't want her, you or I. 
CHORUS. 
We'd better go it rather slow, 
Or break our hearts and sigh, 
We'll do a 
step to let her know, 
She's free from you and I.

Diving deeply in the denseless of the doll.

Standing by the gatelet, 
Where the merry maiden waitlet, 
I

Such a

Where the hilltops were floating in the breezes, 
Dodging hailstones from the gay simoon, 
Picking sponges in the dewItglit of the morning, 
'Neath the darling, charming, old jibboon. 
Citonus. 
Oh, such a 
happy lotlet, 
Standing by the cotlet, 
I 
tell you it was hotlet, 
Then she hit me with a

Mr. Johnny Dougherty. 
Wriacn and sung by H ENRY CARNEY, with marked success at Tony Pas-
tor's Theatre, New York. 
You've all heard of the solid men, 
And men pf great renown; 
But if you'll listen for awhile 
I'm certain you will own 
That I'm the most respected man 
In this great town; and why? 
It is because when I 
walk out 
You will hear the people cry— 
CHORUS. 
I'm Mr. Johnny Dougherty, the tailor 
A man of great renown; 
And everybody knows that to make a 
suit of clothes 
I'm the very best you'll find in all the town. 
I've heard them say a 
tailor is 
The ninth part of a 
man; 
Let them get up and knock me 
Into nine parts if they can. 
Devil a 
one would ever dare 
To box me for a 
foe, 
For I 
can box as well as stitch. 
As very well they know. 
I'm Mr. Johnny Dougherty, Sze.

MY MOTHER-IN-LAW. 
Sung by BILLY PORTER. 
AIR.—" Grandfather's Days." 
If you will listen to me I 
will sing you a 
ditty, 
About the worst woman that ever you saw, 
And when you have heard it you'll say it's a 
pity, 
That ever I 
had such a 
mother-in-law. 
Whatever I 
do she is always fault finding, 
Wherever I 
go she always is there, 
And if I 
don't do everything that she tells me 
She quick helps herself to a 
lock of my hair. 
CHORUS. 
Nfy life is all trouble, I 
cannot be happy, 
If I 
open my mouth she will put in her jaw, 
rather be sent to jail or to Congress, 
Than live all my life with my mother-in-law. 
Now, she is so ugly she frightens the children, 
Whenever she happens to walk in the street, 
For she's got a 
mold like a 
crack in a 
fountain, 
A hump on her back, and such very large feet, 
But she got a 
notion that she is good looking, 
Though her face is the worst one that ever was seen, 
And when she sits down to have her picture taken, 
The first glance she gives breaks the machine. 
My life is all trouble, etc. 
I 
said to her once " When I 
married your daughter, 
I 
did not intend the whole family to wed," 
Then she quickly caught hold of a 
bucket of water, 
And taking good aim let go at my head. 
I 
hear that they do some good shooting at Creedmore, 
That the shots were so close it was almost drawn, 
But I'll bet one dollar that nothing can equal 
That— I 
am glad you beat my mother-
in-law. 
My life is all trouble, etc.

Price 30 cents. 
I've wandered very far away 
From the clime where I 
was born, 
And my poor heart has been so sad, 
Dejected and forlorn; 
No master kind to treat me well, 
To cheer me when in pain, 
I 
want to see the cotton fields, 
And the dear old home again. 
Cnottus. 
Oh the good old days are passed and gone, 
I 
sigh for them in vain ; 
I 
want to see the cotton fields, 
And the dear old home again. 
I'm left all sad and lonely now, 
When my days are very few, 
My wife and children both are gone, 
I 
don't know what to do; 
My master too, he may be dead, 
His hair was turning gray, 
Oh, let me see that good old home, 
Before I 
pass away. 
Oh, the good old days, etc. 
When I 
was free I 
left that land, 
Where the days are bright and fair, 
Where missus spoke to me so kind, 
When I 
was bowed with care ; 
I 
left that home no friends to find, 
My heart was filled with pain, 
Oh, take me to that good old home, 
To see it once again. 
Oh, the good old days,

If I 
Catch The Man Who Taught 
Her to Dance. 
Written, composed and sung by Wm. J. SCANLON, in SCANLON & CrtoNLN's 
famous sketch, entitled " Life in a 
Tenement House." 
I've got a 
daughter I 
talk to all day, 
But the devil a 
word will she mind what I 
say, 
In spite of advice she'll go far away. 
Sometimes she cannot be found. 
If I 
say stay at home, begorra she'll get mad, 
She'll call me an ould tad, say I've got them bad, 
Inside of an oyster I 
ought to be clad, 
To a 
nannie goat I 
ought to be bound. 
CHORUS. 
Ali, but if I 
catch the man 
That taught her to dance 
The la-de-da dance, the tra-le-la dance, 
On the top of his nose I'll make my fist prance, 
And twist off the both of his legs, ha, ha 
Repeat.) 
At night she'll put on her fol-de-lol-1015., 
Then she'll skip off to her picnics and balls, 
Then on the neighbors she'll make her grand 
Borrow all the clothes that she can. 
For a 
bustle she'll 1,vear IIIy co(ierie pants, 
My chin-chilly vest, or anything by chance, 
But if I 
catch the laddie-buck that taught her to dance, 
twist off the both of his legs. 
(Chorus.)

Gwine to take de Tickets at de Gate. 
Oh my soul, my soul, I'm a 
going for to rest, 
In the arms of the angel Gabriel; 
And I 
climb on de hill, and Hooked to de West, 
And I 
cross over Jordan to de Lamb; 
And I 
sit me down in de old arm chair, 
Oh brethren, I'll never tire ; 
Oh Satan may sneeze, but I'll take my ease, 
And I'll warm myself at the holy fire. 
CHORUS. 
For we'll dance, (
Break) 
And we'll shout, (
Break) 
And we'll rise up so early in de morn ; 
Den we will rise, and rub our sleepy eyes, 
When a 
Gabriel am blowing his horn. 
Oh we shan't weep long, when we're going to leave 
So we'll pack up our band box, and we'll go; 
Oh me brudder I'm a 
thinking, and dont you ever grieve 
For we's gwine up to glory very slow; 
And we'll eat our meals three times a 
day, 
And you'll bet your life we won't be late; 
Oh we'll have lots a 
fun, when you and my brudder come, 
For we's gwine to take de tickets at de gate. 
For we'll dance, Sze.

Dedicated to my brother, GEO. A. 
13zANR, J . 
When the dew drop in the buttercup was glistening, 
We wandered o'er the fragrant lea, 
With a 
throbbing heart I 
eagerly was listening; 
To words my lover breathed to me. 
"Believe me when I'm by your side, love, 
I 
never have a 
care, 
Will you ever be my wife and pride, love, 
My treasure rich and rare 
Ever linger by my side. ( Break.) - 
Never let our path deride, (Break.) 
And when no one but the cooing doves were listening, 
Ile kissed me when he told his love, 
Ills black eyes were brighter than dew drops glistening 
On wild flowers in the grove. 
While the rising sun in all his golden splendor 
Smiled on us from the azure sky, 
Close he pressed me to his breast with kisses tender 
As at the gate we said good-bye. 
O'er and o'er I 
softly was repeating 
One little word I'd said, 
With fond love my happy heart was beating, 
I 
whispered I 
would wed.

To the opera I 
went one night, 
And " Martha" was the play, 
The mu ,

And the scene was bright and gay. 
Jewels sparkled on fair forms 
And eyes sparkled as bright, 
And oh, I

The g

My heart beat fast, my cheeks glow 'd rcd, 
My eyes they danced 
Just like two round and shining stars

But every other eye was bent admiringly on me. 
I 
turned my head to look awhile 
And gaze upon the stage, 
I 
knew my hair and dainty bat 
Would soon be all the rage. 
I 
heard a 
long drawn tender sigh, 
The house was then quite still, 
And turned to meet a 
pair of eyes 
That made my IFisom thrill. 
A

And a I 
gazed and listened

As the lady's song her lover's heart 
With the thread she did entwine.

Music, singing, niggers singing and dancing in the barn. 
Den we's off to work in the morning, 
Singing as we go out to the field, 
Picking cotton, all else forgotten, 
Except to see how much de ground do yield.

DANCING IN THE SUNLIGHT, 
Written and composed by JAMES MAAS for the GIRARD BROAII-
ERS, and sung by them with immense success, at the 
Howard Athenmum, Boston. 
What a 
pleasure there is in dancing the sunlight, 
When all earth seems to smile; 
It makes a 
merry ringing in your laughter, 
You have no care or guile. 
With ringing notes from pearly throats, 
We while the hours away;

I'se longing for the good ole times we used to hab of yore 
When we labored in de cotton and de corn, 
And eb'ry night de darkies gather'd 'round de cabin door 
To de calling ob de mellow bugle horn; 
We would dance and we would sing to de banjo's happy ring. 
De ole fiddle and de bones made music too, 
And eb'ry charming yaller gal would to her lover cling, 
While all our hearts were honest, kind and true. 
CHORUS. 
We 
would dance and we would sing to de banjo's happy ring, 
De ole fiddle and de bones made music too, 
And eb'ry charming yaller gal would to her lover cling, 
While all our hearts were honest, kind and true. 
Our ole massa used to like de fun and laugh'd to see de reels 
Dat the boys and girls were always sure to dance, 
And when the " picaninny figs" would turn upon dar heels 
Be ole man would join dem in dat merry prance; 
Tho' he used to give us blows when among de cotton rows, 
lie was kind to us when daily toil was o'er, 
And eb'ry one dat worked upon the old plantation knows 
his heart was bigger dan our sunny shore. 
(Chorus). 
We have heard he joined de army after sending us away 
And was killed in battle down in Tennessee, 
And some one else has told us dat dey heard ole missus say 
lie was sleeping ' neath de ole Palmettostree; 
If de last report is so, all of us would gladly go 
And shed upon his grave a 
friendly tear, 
For eber since we left him we have felt the keenest woe, 
Dar's nothing for de worn out darkey here.

Jealousy." 
Let my name be kindly spoken 
When you're far away from me, 
And although the vows are broken 
I 
will fondly speak of thee. 
All the scenes of days departed 
I'll endeavor to forget, 
And if you are broken-hearted, 
Think not of the days we met. 
CHORUS. 
Let my name be kindly spoken 
When you're far away from me, 
And although the vows are broken 
I 
will fondly .speak of thee. 
In the past we loved each other, 
Loved each other fond and true; 
And I'll never find another 
That can take the place of you. 
Tho' I 
wander on for ever, 
Seeking lands beyond the sea, 
Well I 
know that I 
shall never 
Never find the like of thee. 
Let my name, &c. 
If the fate should bid me meet you 
At some far-off distant day, 
I 
would fondly kiss and greet you 
In the old familiar way. 
Tho' the binding link is broken, 
It is sweet to part as friends, 
And the farewell word that's spoken 
To the heart a 
sweetness lends.

FANCY LITTLE STEP! 
As sung by the RICHMOND SIsrErts. 
Oh! I've come here to tell about 
A 
little lover fair, 
That occurred to me as I 
walked out 
To take the evening air ; 
And on a 
girl I 
chanced to throw 
Such a 
charm, I 
can't forget. 
My admiration was bestowed 
On her fancy little step. 
CHORDS. 
For so easy and so gaily shedid glide, 
[ 
For that little fairy I 
would have died, 
(Break, 
For her head was bending low, 
As he gracefully on did go, 
With a 
silver pair of tassells 
On her high-heeled boots, 
And her fancy little step. 
[Daaa. • 
Iint.she has gone, and now I 
grieve, 
I 
really think its mean ; 
And after this I 
will believe 
That love is but a 
dream; 
And when many years have gone, 
I 
never shall forget 
The girl that had the pleasant smile, 
And the fancy little step!

I 
need no introduction, so well known am I, 
For my honesty in this city I've gained fame ; 
I'm called by some Boss O'Kelly, I 
run the Tammany Hall, 
Bum politicians tremble at the mention of my name. 
I 
have but to spake the word, and you'd perish from my sight, 
There's very few can beat me turning a 
trick ; 
I 
could make you President, or to Washington have you sent, 
What a 
King I'd make, oh, oh, I'm solid as a 
brick. 
CHORUS. 
I 
am so consequential, and so influential, 
When once I 
make a 
move, ' tis useless to kick ; 
Noted for my f
-entility, Pm a 
man of great ability, 
I'm John O'Kelly, the Great, I'm solid as a 
brick. 
When Congress it does meet, before they pass a 
law 
All our statesmen can be seen consulting me ; 
'Tis then I 
spake my mind, like the honest man I 
am, 
But of course I 
don't forget ould Tammany. 
There are some renegades—there's black sheep in every flock, 
But with our next move we'll make them sick ; 
When once more we have—on next election day— 
*Tis then they'll see I'm solid as a 
brick. 
I'm so consequential, &c,

WHEN YOU HEAR THE BUGLE. 
Written by Ned t
r:oss. 
As sung by Goss and Fox. 
You may take me to the east, 
You may take me to the west, 
lint I'll hear that bugle sounding in the morning, 
On the land or on the sea, 
No matter where I 
be, 
I 
will hear that bugle sounding in the morning. 
Citonus. 
You will hear those sinners cry, 
And look up to'ards the sky, 
When they hear the bugle sounding in the morning, 
Yes, they'll look up to'ard's the sky, 
And watch the black angels fly, 
-When they hear the bugle sounding in the mottling. 
Just at the nick of time, 
When we reach the dividing line, 
We will hear that bugle sounding in the morning, 
We'll see sinners on that day, 
Flop their wings and fly away, 
When they hear that bugle sounding in the morning 
CHORE'S. 
You will hear those sinners cry, 
And look up to' ards the sky, 
when they hear the bugle sounding in the morning, 
Yes, they'll look up to'‘ards the sky, 
And watch the black angels fly, 
When they hear the bugle sounding in the morning. 
We'll all get Jolly as the Night Wears on, 
I 
don't like a 
fellow who's stingy and close, 
And can't bear to part with a 
crown, 
Nor yet do I 
like him who's stern and morose, 
And looks on the world with a 
frown ; 
But give me the fellow whoe'er he may be, 
Who cares not for peasant or king, 
Who likes a 
good spree, that's the fellow for me, 
And with him I'll merrily sing—. 
CHORUS. 
Drink, boys, drink, and let your glasses jingle, 
Drink, boys, drink, and bid dull care be gone, 
Shout, boys, shout, and let your voices mingle, 
We'll all get jolly as the night wears on. 
'Tis fine of an evening when business is done, 
And the toils of the day have gone past, 
To sit in the parlor of some cosy pub. 
And drown all your cares in a 
glass ; 
Let squeamish teetot'lers drink coffee and tea, 
And prate of the coppers they save, 
I 
laugh at their cant, and tho' they may rant, 
I'll sing till I'm laid in my grave— 
Drink, boys, drink, &e. 
Of friends I've a 
few, such a 
rollicking crew, 
And trouble assails us in vain, 
We meet every night and often get tight, 
On brandy or glorious champagne; 
For frolic and noise faith we are the boys, 
And then as the hours speed along, 
We call in the host, who gives us a 
toast, 
Or sings us this right jovial song— 
Drink, boys, drink, &c. 
To fall deep in love with a 
sweet turtle dove, 
Very fine for some fellows may be, 
But the exquisite bliss of a 
woman's sweet kiss, 
Has no great attraction for me; 
At young Cupid's shrine to kneel I 
decline, 
To Bacchus I'll Vick hard and fast, 
With a 
dollar to spend and another to lend, 
And gaily I'll sing to the last— 
Drink, boys, drink, &c. 
We Are Gwine Away.

Oh, good evening white folks, one and all, 
We ask your attention for awhile; 
We'll sing and dance and do the best we can, 
We hope you'll like our old plantation style, 
Down on the Mississippi, where we were bred and born. 
CHORUS. 
But now we're gwine away, 
We ain't got long to stay, 
So fare you well white folks, one and all. 
How often we'd go up on the deck, 
'Twas then the moon was shining bright ; 
We sang dar our good old nigger songs, 
And den we jump and dance with all our might. 
The white folks used to laugh, and clap their hands so loud, 
They'd make us sing and dance again, 
Then didn't we feel proud.

So fare you well white folks, one and all.

You see before you now two peculiar sort of figs, 
Aunt Hannah and Aunt Chloe,

There's where it is our glory. 
But when we lived in Florida how happy we were then; 
We had a 
good old massa and he was the best of men. 
CHORUS. 
Old aunt Hannah and aunt Chloe 
Is happy as can be; 
Old aunt Hannah and aunt Chloe 
Were born way down in Florida. 
(Dance.) 
Them good old days are gone, and they'll never come 
no more 
To the children of this nation, 
When we would sing and dance on the old kitchen floor, 
And raise a 
big sensation; 
You could hear us darkies laughing almost a 
mile around, 
When all was still and silent on the old plantation 
ground.

M Y 
joyous days have passed away, 
For me there's no more rest; 
In Heaven's home soon I 
will be 
Amongst the innocent and blest, 
With angels bright in robes so white 
To protect and guide me on. 
There's a 
laurel now awaits the brow 
Of poor old, feeble Uncle Tom. 
No friend, no home, I'm left alone; 
To my grave I'm journeying on. 
Who will care, or shed a 
tear 
For poor old, feeble Uncle Tom? 
My wife and children, far apai t, 
In some distant spot this world they roam, 
Or the good lamb granted their desire 
And their spirits away to heaven have flown. 
When my bones lay beneath the clay, 
And this sheep to his shepherd has gone; 
When you kneel to pray, a 
prayer then say 
For poor old, feeble Uncle Tom. 
When my bones lay beneath the clay, 
And this sheep to his shepherd has gone; 
When at prayer you kneel, a 
prayer then yield 
For poor old, feeble Uncle Tom.

Kissing in the Moonlight. 
As sung by Miss GRACE GARLAND. 
There are many pleasures spoken of 
By all, both young and old 
There are fishing, boating, parties, too, 
And picnics, I 
am told. 
But of all the pleasures there is none— 
I'm sure you'll say I'm right— 
As to place your arm round her you love 
And kiss her in the moonlight. 
'CHORUS. 
She's aslandsome as a 
lily in the summer, ( Sym.) 
I'm proud to tell you all that I 
have won her. (Sym.) 
Of all the pleasures spoken of— 
I'm sure you'll say I'm right— 
Is to place your arm round her you love 
And kiss her in the moonlight. 
I 
met her first one summer's eve, 
I 
raised my hat and said. 
" 
I 
pray, dear miss, may I 
beg leave 
To ask you if you'll wed?" 
She raised her eyes, and sweetly smiled, 
It filled me with delight; 
So I 
placed my arm around her waist 
And kissed her in the moonlight. 
She's as handsome, &c.

Good evening, how do you do? 
I'm not very well myself. 
I 
haven't had a 
drink to-day, 
Because I

Now what do you suppose ?

'Cause I 
had blossoms on my nose.

Going down the street to-day,

friend of mine; 
He asked me for to have a 
drink, 
Of course I

And called me a

With blossoms on your snoot."

As I 
came down the street to-day 
I 
saw some girls and boys

On Simpson's alley gate.

Oh yes, you bet we had good times 
In old New Hampshire State, 
When brother Ike and I

To play with me and Ike, 
But when we swung him on the,gate 
His clothes caught on a

He tore his coat and trousers, too; 
When he got home ' twas late, 
His father swore at me and Ike 
And Simpson's alienate.

Our Own Original Style. 
GROTESQUE SONG AND DANCE. 
Words by Geo. Leslie. 
Music by Ned Straight. 
Sung by Leslie & Mack. 
Here we are two lively coons from sunny Georgia, 
Where the sugar cane and cotton flowers grow, 
And we used to work all day hoeing sweet corn 
On the banks where the Mississippi flows. 
When our master is away we practice dancing, 
Play the banjo till its time to get our meals, 
After supper we would go into the barn yard, 
And dance the Essence and Virginia Reels, 
CHORUS. 
For we're high-toned aristocratic nigs, (Break.) 
Double-breasted acrobatic rigs, ( Break.) 
For we will join together and sing and dance all day, 
Throwing somersaults is our delight, 
To us it's only play, 
We'll throw our feet clean out of sight, 
We're bound to make you smile, 
For what these nigs can do, 
We will quickly show to you, 
In our own original style. 
Oh, we twist ourselves in every shape and form, 
For to please you all kind friends we'll try, 
While dancing we are in the hours of pleasure, 
And our legs in knots together we will tie. 
We're grotesque, break neck, like india rubber, 
And we kick our feet so gently in the air, 
Keep the time so perfect with the music, 
For we are a 
team that make a 
lively pair.

And there'll be razors flying in the air. 
And when the ball ivas over, 
We all went merrily home

There's a 
maxim I 
can give, 
Simple, clear, and true, 
Teaching you the way to live, 
Showing what to do. 
Stand by this where'er you go, 
Wheresoe'er you dwell, 
Be your station high or low, 
" 
Do your duty well." 
CHORUS. 
If you would from care be free, 
Every grief dispel, 
Let your motto ever be 
" 
Do your duty well." 
If you rule yourself aright, 
If you persevere, 
You may make the future bright, 
Though the past be drear; 
Every man must play his part, 
Sorrow comes to all, 
But a 
light and cheerful heart 
Makes the trouble small. 
If you would, ote. 
Don't let envy fill your mind, 
If upon the road, 
You should meet a 
friend and find, 
His a 
lighter load. 
Though you have more hardly faired, 
Lessons you will learn, 
Which will make you well prepares 
When the tide shall turn.

you would, eta.

Oh I 
am an unhappy moke, 
A more wretched one never wa2 seen, 
Pll tell you the cause, 
And you'll say what & victim rye been. 
Por I 
loved a 
fair =id, 
As black as the ace of spades; 
She was chef engineer of a 
kitchen near hero, 
And boss of the scullery maids. 
CHORUS. 
Oh my, what a 
shame, another galoot came about, 
He was a 
black millionare, and quickly he cut me out, 
My eye what a 
shame, if I 
only could catch that galoot, 
I'd send him a 
challenge ts meet me to night, 
And I'd bat him right in the snoot, 
Her name you must know 
Was Georgia Juliet Fan; 
His name I've been told 
Was Alonzo Othello M'Cann, 
He was a 
native of Greece, 
A man infthe soap fat line 
And only she fell in love with his can, 
That kitchen maid might have been mine. 
Oh my, e..c. 
One night to the kitchen rwent, 
And then what a 
sight did I 
see; 
The soap fat man was there with his can, 
And she sittinuight on his knee 
In a 
rage I 
rushed at them both; 
Him to the ground I 
did fling; 
And there in the kitchen I 
knocked out his orifne.) 
With a 
stone from my Diamond ring 
' 
Oh my, &ea 
She for a 
policeman did call, 
And quickly they rushed to the stoop; 
They found the girl was smothered right there 
With her head in a 
pot of clam soup 
They dragged me off to the court. 
And there not a 
word could I 
speak, 
They tried me for stealing the soap fat can, 
And hung me in less than a 
week. 
CHORUS. 
Oh my, wha a 
sname, another galoot came about, 
He was a 
black millionaire and quickly he cut me out; 
My eye, what a 
shame, that yaller gal might have been min 
And we'd all be alive if it wasn't for him, 
That man in the soap fat line. 
The Electric Light. 
Sung by TONY PASTOR, at his own theatre, Broadway, with great 
success. 
The time is coming when no one can tell the day from night, 
And that will be when we shall see the new electric light. 
Then gas will have to vanish, as all gassy subjects should, 
And the "Yankee Triumph" it will shine upon the bad and 
good; 
The bold policeman on his beat can never go to sleep, 
While all our ball-room beauties, who now look so nice at night, 
Will not seem quite so charming by the new electric Light_ 
CHORUS. 
There's some of us will welcome, 
And some will hate the sight 
Of the latest, greatest wonder, 
That's the new Electric Light. 
The light will show our loving wives if husbands come home 
" 
straight," 
And all the " spooney " pairs at night a 
kissing at the gate! 
'Twill show the rich man just the way to help the starving 
poor, 
And the way to keep the prowling wolf from honest labor's 
door! 
'Twill show the road to " good old times," now specie pay-
ment's here, 
And how long Murphy's converts will abstain from gin and 
beer! 
'Twill show us how our sweethearts keep their " curls" so 
long and bright, 
We'll see what makes their " blushes " by the new Electric 
Light. 
There's some of us, &c. 
THE ELECTRIC LIGHT. 
Continued. 
This light will show us how to got the " cash " from " broken 
banks," 
And why them bold directors are allowed to play such pranks. 
'Twill show us why policemen club the helpless and the old, 
When the banks are robbed in broad daylight by burglars 
stout and bold! 
'Twill help a 
girl to ferret out what tints her sweetheart's 
nose, 
And why her dashing neighbors wear such fine, expensive 
clothes. 
'Twill show us if those " cyphers " that we read of were all 
right, 
We'll find our honest statesmen by the new Electric Light. 
There's some of us, &c. 
This light will show the 'honest man beneath the ragged coat, 
And why our " Little Johnny" wouldn't let the people vote. 
'Twill guide the Reverand Talmage on some other vice to 
speak, 
And will show him clearly " some " are " frauds" who hear 
him twice a 
week. 
'Twin show who writes the " Personals," and what they all 
may mean, 
And why the girls with " navy busts' when dressed so stout 
are seen ? 
Why some one found a 
baby on his door step one fine night, 
Nill soul look quiet apparent by the new Electric Light.

GET 'Mr 
-dgif 
Written by C. R. Dockstader, for and sung by .J. D. Roome. 
As I 
was a 
reading the paper last night, 
I 
saw there a 
story that I 
will recite, 
It's about a 
young damsel got stuck on a 
clerk, 
She bothered him daily while he was at work 
Oh, this gal she would watch him and on him keep an eye, 
She swore she would have him or with him she' d 
die, 
When she went to embrace him he'd yelp loud and strong. 
Get thee gone girl, get thee gone girl, 
But the girl wouldn't get thee gone. 
Oh, she tortured him hourly and stuck just like glue, 
He wasted away and his clothes he fell through. 
He rented a 
barnyard and slept in the shed, 
And this girl she hung till his reason had fled, 
Now she crawled through a 
knot hole and roost by his side 
With a 
hunk of blue ribbon his ankles she tied, 
When he awoke from his sliimbers like a 
hero did say, 
Get thee away girl, get thee away girl, 
But the girl wouldn't get thee away. 
Oh, she followed him around and one evenitg he died, 
He opened his mug and he let his breath slide, 
In an alley way they have laid him to take his last sleero. 
Where the torn cats do fight apd the bull hogs do eat, 
Oh, she dressed herself up in a 
new sunday coat, 
With some white wash his age on a 
shovel. she -wrote 
Now she gets boiling full and the boys all Jo shout, 
Get thee out girl, get thee out girl, 
But the girl don't get thee out.

On the Road. 
Written ty CHARLES F. 
JEROME. 
I 
tell you it's no use talking, boys, I'm going to stop right here, 
I've had no money for the last three weeks, and the " man-
ager " I 
think is queer ; 
Now, what's the old guy giving us, when he says he's got no 
money ? 
I'm sure the house was good last night, so he needn't get so 
funny. 
Why, the hotel man is kicking, and the board bill's up to-day, 
So if it's not settled by this evening, we'll have to skip away; 
And the Chinese laundry's got my washing—I've only got one 
collar— 
And he says that he won't give them up, for I 
owe him just 
one dollar. 
So let us go and strike his nibs, and see what we can do, 
Tell him we must have some wealth, and we may catch a 
case or two. 
And if he doesn't give it up, we'll not go on to-night, 
For he cannot do without us, boys, so we have him dead to 
rights; 
Just tell the song and dance men what we are going to do, 
And tell them not to wash up until they get their money, too. 
And tell that " serio-comic queen" she'd better write for dates, 
Or we'll put her up for a 
walking match against her rival— 
" 
Kitty Bates." 
Also that snide Dutch actor, he need not be afraid, 
If he gets left upon the road, he can go and learn a 
trade. 
So the best thing, boys, that we can do, is to try and stop this 
" 
beat," 
For he may think, as others do, that actors never eat ; 
And I 
know that I 
eat regular—that is, when I'm at home, 
And when I 
strike that good old spot, I 
never more will roam.

Grandpa's chair is vacant, 
Near the fire in the grate; 
Where he told his tales of boyhood, 
Kept the little ones awake. 
One eve, so worn and weary, 
Sleeping on his knee they lay, 
Death called that night, like the fire bright, 
Grandpa passed away. 
Camas. 
So let the room be cheerful, 
Place the old arm chair 
Where we talked to Grandpa, 
With his silvery snow white hair. 
How he'd watch the falling ashes, 
And sadly meditate, 
Gently sigh, we all must die, 
Like the fire in the grata. 
One bitter night in winter, 
The snow fell fast and wild; 
A 
girl looked in the window, 
A 
careworn, hapless child; 
Then Grandpa whispered " baby," 
And toddled to the gate, 
To save from sin, he brought her in, 
Near the fire in the grate. 
So let the room, etc 
Keep the fire burning, 
'Tis charity's bright flame; 
Reminding of the evening 
The orphan Mary came, 
Bo ragged, cold and hungry, 
With Grandpa from the gate; 
For hin she kneels, sprayer she yields, 
Near the fire in the grate.

String Clam Jimmy. 
Written and sung with great success by NED TALa0T. 
Aia : " Champagne Charley." 
Some time ago there was a 
fig, 
Who used to go about, 
A 
screaming " Who'll buy my string clams, 
I 
feel so awful stout." 
This fig he was the size of a 
pig 
A 
feeding in the sty, 
And the only thing that happened him, 
He had a 
string clam eye. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, String Clam Jimmy was his name, 
His old woman never could make him tame, 
He'd roar with fright both day and night, 
For String Clam Jimmy was his name, ta ta. (Repeat.) 
Now Jimmy he fell in love one day 
With a 
girl with cross-eyed feet; 
She said she would not let him go 
Until she'd cut his teeth. 
She busted his poor pocketbook, 
Which made him fell so sore; 
She gave him the slip and split his lip, 
Then skipped right out the door. 
Oh, String Clam Jimmy, &c. 
Dear Jimmy is contented now, 
He never goes about, 
He says bad times has spoiled the trade, 
Now don't that nigger shout. 
He feels so weak, he's got a 
cheek 
About three ton and a 
half, 
He looked so nice they put him on ice, 
Now how's that for a 
laugh 7 
Oh, String Clam Jimmy, & c.

The Pride of Petticoat Lane. 
I'm not going to say that she's a 
queen because I 
know she 
aint, 
Nor yet a 
perfect beauty, an angel nor a

For I

Always Speak A Kind Word When 
You Can. 
Originally sung by Wmr.H.1411oirrox, America's Comique, at the Park 
Novelty Theatre, Brooklyn. 
New sayings are all the rage on the street and on the stage 
And many a 
glorious maxim you may find, 
But there's one more than the rest seems to linger in my 
breast, 
And often comes a 
floating o'er my mind, 
I 
will tell you here to-night this motto true and bright, 
A 
lesson it conveys sublime and grand, 
To the beggar at your door, to all people rich or poor, 
Always speak a 
kind word when you can. 
i 
Now if perchance you meet an old friend upon the street, 
lie is poor and all the world may sneer at him, 
Oh, do not pass him by in despair to live or die, 
But remember that his poverty is no sin, 
Then help him with a 
will, show that you respect him still, 
Welcome him and grasp him by the hand, 
Do not turn your head away, but remember what I 
say, 
Always speak a 
kind word when you can. 
There's many and many a 
man who no riches can command, 
Yet he may be the noblest of them all, 
Many a 
glorious deed he's done, many a 
victory he has won, 
Yet his honors and rewards are very small, 
But when he's dead and gone, his loss they deeply mourn, 
He's a 
monument of friends on every hand, 
And his praises they relate when they know it is too late, 
For they never speak a 
kind word when they can. 
'Always Count The Cost. 
Written tali sung by HARRY BECKWITH, "America's ComiqueX 
lnere's many maxims quaint and old 
We find to-day quite new, 
And though we oft have heard them told. 
Yet they are good as new. 
While looking over them one day, 
This one I 
came across: 
ILet Life's affairs be what they may, 
Tis best to count the Cost." 
CHORUS. 
/Then always count the cost, 
Yes, always count the cost ; 
I 
Bear this in mind, don't go it blind, 
But stop and count the cost. 
'cis quite the fashion nowadays 
To go it rather fast; 
Excesses in a 
hundred ways 
The health of many blast. 
The fruits of toil or wealth, perhaps, 
Is from them idly tossed; 
,But by and by a 
grand collapse 
Will make them count the cost. 
Then always count the cost, zte. 
Perhaps a 
simple life to you 
Seems not a 
blissful state, 
And so you find, as many do, 
Some day, perhaps, a 
mate. 
Now marriage is quite well, but still 
Love's labor will be lost 
And wedlock prove a 
bitter pill 
Unless you count the cost. 
Then always count the cost, &e 
Each day we see some splendid chance 
Our money to invest, 
And hopes of gain our soul enchants, 
So then we make the test; 
In stocks, and bonds, and savings banks, 
We think it can't be lost; 
$ome day you'll find that Fortune's pranks 
-.Will make you,GQ_Iw, the cost. (Clio

Husband...10 CtS. 
American Fortune-Telling Cards.—This is the‘old-
est and most widely known pack of Fortune-Telling Cards. We have 
published it for years, and the demand is continually increasing. 
These Cards are arranged and printed in series—Hearts, Clubs, Dia-
monds and Spades—and each of these into K for King, Q for Queen, 
tied K 
for Knave, and numbers 1, 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
four rows, and are to be read according to directions. 
Many of the an-
swers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under-
standing. 
Many professional Fortune-Tellers use these cards, and we 
are in receipt of 
l
etters 
in 
relation 
to them from all parts of the U. S.

Courting Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such P, way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by 
ntlernen who are either too diffi-
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. 
The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unladylike encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. 
This pack of Cards will overcome the dim. 
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the ga me 
as 
their 
own, 
unless 
it 
accords 
with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes a 
further explanation un-
necessary. 
The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties

And virtue warmed her heart. 
But, ah l 
the cruel spoiler came—" 
This book, in the language of Mrs. Howson " affords a 
striking example 
that vice, however prosperous in the beginning, in the end only leads 
to misery and shame."

leading New York Papers say of it: 
The N. Y. Evening Mail writes 
" 
A 
Little Book has lately appeared in print at Mr. A. J. Fisakn's, 98 Nas 
sau street, called the " Little Flirt." We 
cannot say that we recommend 
it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, as we think it would only 
encourage the bad habit of " flirting." Unfortunately, there is enough 
of it done without any further necessity of explaining 
how, when and 
where to do it," and this little volume would advise and initiate the un-
corrupted in practicing what is commonly called "flirting." 
The N. Y. Evening Telegram writes: " We have lately seen a 
neattile 
book, bound in Morocco leather, costing twenty-five cents, call4d the 
"Little Flirt," published by A. J. 
FISHER, No. 98 Nassau Str6et. 
It 
gives information of the modus operandi of flirting, and of the mean-
ing of every motion of the handkerchief, fan, glove and parasol. As 
there is nothing at all objectionable in the volume, and its contents 
might afford some innocent amusement to many, we do not hesitate to 
recommend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers."

Prof. E. D. Davies. whose fame is equally great in Europe and America— 
can become proficient by application. -It is an art which affords so 
much entertainment in the way of harmless jokes, that all who have 
xisnre should not neglect cultivating it .
