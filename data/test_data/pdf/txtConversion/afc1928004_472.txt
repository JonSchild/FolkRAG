Biographical Sketch 
OF 
LITTLE ROSEBUD, 
The above-named prodigy of juvenile talent was born in Washing-
ton, D. C., in the year 1872, and is therefore at the present writing 
but seven years of age. 
Considering this, it seems little short of 
being miraculous that such a 
tender mite of humanity should already 
figure as the most talented child actress on the American stage. The 
first appearance of the precocious little lady on the boards was at 
the National Theatre, Washington, under the auspices of the vet-
eran manager, Mr. John T. Ford, on the occasion of the benefit of 
" 
Buffalo Bill," (Win. F. Cody), in the year 1877 when she was only 
five years old. 
So favorable was the impression created by the as-
tonishing child artist that the stage immediately marked her for its 
own. In the two years which have elapsed since that night of infan-
tile success, LITTLE RosEnun has gone on in her sweet way, winning 
triumph and captivating the hearts of all who have seen her and 
watched the unfolding of her surprising genius. 
She has played the 
most successful engagements which have ever been scored to the 
credit of a child artist, appearing at Harrigan & Hart's Theatre 
Comique, Tony Pastor's New Theatre and leading theatres through-
out the United States. 
Her talent is as versatile as it is surprising. 
Nothing seems to be too difficult for this fairy star to attempt and 
accomplish. 
Her imitations of older professional favorites are 
simply wonderful for their cleverness and correctness, ranging, 
as they do, from the life-like reproduction of the brusque, side-split-
ting drollery of the popular Pat Rooney to the champagny vivacity 
of the Great Mdlle. Aimee. 
Her childish beauty is attractive ; her 
songs are new, original and exquisitely sung; while her dancing is 
the perfection of ease and grace. 
There is a brilliant future before 
the gifted child artist; may she live long to look back with pride and 
pleasure to her very early triumphs.

I AM LITTLE, BUT YOU BET THAT I 
CAN 
DANCE. 
Copyright secured 1879. 
Written by ANDY HUGHES, for LITTLE ROSEBUD, and sung by her 
with unbounded applause. 
No doubt you look at me 
As my tiny form you see, 
And think that I 
am very, very small ; 
But yet, despite my size, 
I 
will make you ope your eyes, 
And I 
hope for an encore you will call. 
I 
will now tell to you 
How it was I 
never grew, 
If you will only give me but a 
chance; 
And when I'm done 
see 
You will all agree with me 
I'm little, but you bet that I 
can dance. 
(Dance) 
I 
used to watch the boys 
Dance around and make a 
noise, 
I 
used to try and beat the very best, 
And with my little jig 
made a 
hit so big 
That they said I 
was the boss of all the rest. 
I 
conic here every night, 
When I 
see your eyes so bright, 
For I 
delight around the stage to prance, 
And when I'm done you see 
You will all agree with me, 
I'm little, but you bet that I 
can dance. 
LITTLE ROSEBUD. 
Written by Wm. ScANLoy for LITTLE ROSEBUD, as sung by her with 
great success. 
I 
feel so good this evening, 
1'11 sing for you with ease, 
And while I'm here before you all 
I'll do my best to please. 
I 
am always dress'd in fashion, 
For I 
love to dress in style, 
Especially when dancing, 
The hours to beguile. 
Cumws. 
Little Rosebud, Little Rosebud, 
That's what they all call me ; 
Of all the flowers that bloom in spring 
There's none so sweet as me. 
(Repeat) 
My Pa and Ma are wealth*y, 
The pride of all the town, 
For wealth and fashion they have gained 
A name of great renown. 
You should see me out on Sunday 
As I 
walk along the street, 
For grace and style I 
am admired 
By every one I 
meet.

THE PALACE UPON T111", ROCIO. 
Written and sung by JACK CONROY. 
Pat McAllister of Harlem Flats 
Presents himself to you ; 
And whin he has on his Hibernian dress 
He is a 
masher too. 
A 
widdy fell in love with me, 
In Erie she has stocks, 
She has a 
palace at Central Park, 
Built upon the rocks. 
SPOKEN. — And every Sunday, dressed in my cross-
grain de Bashall suit, I 
visit the little palace, chat 
love for awhile, she then calls her only son in a 
musi-
cal son in a 
musical voice, and says— 
CHORUS. 
Paddy conic here to your mother, 
That's the darlin' dear, 
Don't you cause any bother, 
Run out for a 
quart of beer. 
Don't go near the Dutchman's avick, 
You know he is a 
skin, 
But go around where it is cheaper and better, 
Go around to Teddy McGlynn. 
I've taken her over to Hoboken 
On many a 
summer's day, 
And there upon the Elysian Fields, 
Our figures we'd display. 
Her's was nate and trim, me boys, 
Three-fifty was her weight. 
She'd make me stand outside of the boat, 
For she wouldn't fit in a 
sate. 
Paddy come here to your mother, etc. 
In a 
snug retreat at Central Park, 
We wint one beautiful night, 
An' there we had a 
jug of the best, 
Both of us got tight. 
A 
policeman he came along, 
And the both of us took away, 
And next morning down at the Tombs 
I 
had both fines to pay. 
Paddy come here to your mother, etc.

LEVI KASSIDAY. 
Written, composed and sung by J. E. Munpny, of Murphy & Mack 
in the laughable sketch, entitled " The Secret." 
Published and copyrighted 1879, by E. H. 
HARDING, 229 Bowery 
and sent to any address, postpaid, on receipt of 35 cents. 
Now list ye to my classic lay, 
Politely hearken loudly, while 
I 
sing of Levi Kassiday, 
A 
blazing star of solid style; 
From Coney Isle to Zululand, 
From sweet Cohohohoes to Newfoundland, 
Roam where you will a man you'll never find 
Like Levi Kassiday. 
CHORUS. 
For he's a 
man, understan', 
Wid a 
very fine eye for a 
nice young girl, 
And a 
prhno judge of Dublin wine, 
.And creamy cream of the style, do you mind, 
Wid a 
rose like his nose, 
Of a 
color as bright as the red blue say, 
Oh, it's on the street, there's a 
few you'll meet 
Like Levi Kassiday. 
A-down the street with stately tread, 
And style that dislocates them all, 
Meanders he, enveloped in, 
A 
brand new fresh spring suit of gaul; 
Upon his arm hangs Julia Ann, 
Sweet lady bird of this daisy man, 
A Don Jubannes in his mind is he, 
This Levi Kassiday. 
For he's a 
man, etc. 
When voices sweet were handed round, 
Levi was not behind the door, 
An over strung bass voice has he, 
He sang the " mast" in " Pinafore." 
From Asiah to Kalamazu, 
From Canadaw to San Franciscu, 
Another one of it you'll seldom meet 
Like Levi Kassiday. 
For he's a 
man, etc.

When I 
landed at Castle Garden, 
About ten years ago. 
I 
made my home in a 
tenement house 
In Cherry street below. 
'Twas there I 
got acquainted 
Wid a 
German girl so gay, 
It was only six months after, 
She named my wedding day. 
Cuonus. 
Ring a 
wreath of roses, 
We'll ring a 
wreath for the; 
All the little children, 
Sang so sweet to me ; 
Ladies came in carriages. 
With presents and boquets, 
To little Michael Callihan, 
Upon his wedding day. 
It was on a 
Saturday evening, 
With laugh and merry shout, 
The boys and girls in the neighborhood, 
So gaily did turn out ; 
The old folks dressed their very best, 
And had funny things to say 
To Mike and Lena Callihan, 
Upon their wedding day. 
Ring a 
wreath of roses, etc. 
There was August Schmitt and Kunkle, 
And Henry Cisehnyer, 
With all my wife's relations. 
And Cohn the old clothes buyer. 
My brothers Pat and Danny. 
Wid the ladies danced the glide, 
But the Germans tried to kill them when 
They tried to kiss the bride. 
Ring a 
wreath of roses, etc. 
AN THE NEWSBOY. 
Words by GER. FALCON. 
Who is there that's heard not of Newspaper Nan, 
That broth of a 
boy with the soul of a 
man; 
He's the peer of the piers and the dolphin of docks 
With the heart of a 
lion, the wit of a 
fox ; 
As swift as a 
shark and as strong as a 
seal, 
With wave-toughened muscles and sinews of steel, 
The eye of an eagle and visage of tan, 
I'm sure we have dog-ger-o-typed Newspaper Nan. 
CHORUS. 
Jolly Nan! Plucky Nan ! though why he's called Nan, 
I'm sure I 
don't know—you may tell if you can. 
He's fearless of heart and he's sturdy of limb, 
He is hefty on diving and great on the swim, 
Not one of the crowd, Patsey, Jerry or Dan 
Can hold a 
cent candle to Newspaper Nan. 
Some folks have been puzzled to know how he came 
To carry through life such a 
feminine name, 
Some hint he's a 
mermaid devoid of the tail, 
While others as stoutly contend he's a 
male; 
That matter he leaves them to fix as they please 
While he goes a-STARIN' the rivers and seas, 
Astonishing dogs brought from far Newfoundlan', 
For the prince of life-savers is Newspaper Nan. 
Jolly Nan! plucky Nan! etc. 
He beats Captain Boynton in spite of his suit, 
And gives him a 
mile or two's start into boot ; 
He shrinks not from Webb, saucy king of the sea, 
For his chums swear he's just as web-footed as he. 
Across the Atlantic he swims very soon 
To pick up what drops from the mammoth baloon, 
And then we will see with his tail like a 
fan 
Come back o'er the ocean great Nobleman Nan. 
Jolly Nan! plucky Nan! etc.

LITTLE ROSEI3UD. 
Words by DEXTER SMITH. 
Music by W. H. BROCKWAY. 
Music to be had of Wm. 
Co., 25 Union Square. • 
[Sung with great success by the little favorite, LITTLE ROSEBUD. 
Little Rosebud, are you lonely, 
Now I 
am so far away? 
For of you I'm thinking only, 
As I 
ever sadly stray; 
Since from you I 
sweetly parted, 
Earth has no delights for me, 
And I 
wander heavy hearted 
O'er the land, and o'er the sea. 
CHORUS. 
Little rosebud, are you lonely, 
Now I 
am so far away? 
For of you I'm thinking only, 
As I 
ever sadly stray. 
Little rosebud, I 
am coming 
Rome to see you once again; 
For I'm weary now of roaming, 
Drifting o'er the stormy main. 
Will you welcome home the ranger 
To the sunshine of your smile? 
Then will sadness be a 
stranger, 
And life's sweetest joys beguile. 
Little rosebud, etc.

BUTTERCUPS AND DAISIES. 
11 
As recited by LITTLE ROSEBUD. 
WHEN a 
little boy I 
wandered, ' twas a 
pleasant 
summer's day, 
My heart was like a 
feather as I 
journeyeu on 
my way, 
To my eager footsteps soft the green grass laid, 
With a 
little playmate, such a 
tiny maid; 
Playing I 
AtiaS poor man, playing she was rich, 
How her merry laughter reached the highest pitch, 
Pointing to the daisies silver wealth untold, 
Buttercups unnumbered, these she said were gold. 
With the time departing soon the air was chilled, 
Out upon the crisp wind, loud the robin thrilled, 
Once again I 
wandered with my little maid, 
To our treasure garden vast in wealth arrayed; 
Soon we knew a 
robber, Jack Frost was his name, 
Had been there before us and taken all our gain 
With his icy fingers and a 
grasp so cold, 
Stole our silver daisies and buttercups of gold. 
Man's estate I 
reached then, but I 
ne'er forgot 
My little maid companion and our treasure spot, 
For then was a 
lesson in our strange belief, 
Summer was our banker, winter was our thief; 
So it is with friends, then sometimes so with all, 
They're true to us in sunshine but leave us in 
the fall; 
When a 
warm friend slights me or he treats me 
cold, 
I 
think of silver daisies and buttercuti; of gold,

I 
have a 
daughter, name Julia, 
She's seventeen, 
And I'm tould by all the neighbors, 
That she is like a 
queen. 
At all the balls and parties, 
My Julia she is all the rage, 
In the ballet she is a 
star, 
When my daughter leaps out on the stage. 
CHORUS. 
Dancing round on her toes, 
To the music around she goes; 
Oh, waltzing around with Julia, 
My Julia she is all the rage, 
In the ballet she's a 
star, 
When my daughter leaps out on the stage. 
When the music's playing, 
How the people all shout; 
On the stage they throw bouquets, 
When my daughter does come out. 
She dresses like a 
fairy, 
At it she's engaged ; 
She looks like me in the tra la la lee, 
When my daughter leaps out on the stage, 
Papcing round on her too, etQ.,

PEE= AS A PICTURE. 
As sung by MACKIN & W ILSON, 
Jh! my heart is gone, and I'm forlorn, 
A 
darling face has won me, 
Such a 
lovely girl, with teeth of pearl, 
I 
met down by the brook, 
She is the prettiest, and the wittiest, 
Tier smile has quite undone me, 
I'm her only beau, she told me so, 
When first my arm she took, 
She's as pretty as a 
picture, 
And her voice is just the cage, where the little birds ar5 
singing, 
She's the sweetest, and the neatest, 
She's as pretty as a 
picture all the while. 
CHORUS. 
Oh ! my heart is gone, and I'm forlorn, 
Her darling face has won me, 
Such a 
lovely girl, with teeth of pearl, 
An angel without wings,

,,,,  
The roses scarce could hear us, 
Then my hears in sport, 'twas cupid's caught, 
Like fishes near the shore. 
i 
When I 
loved her so, as I 
turned to go, 
She fondly lingered near me, 
And she drooped her head, and sweetly said, 
I 
wish you au—revoir, 
She's as pretty as a 
picture, 
And my heart is a golden frame, whenever 
find her, 
She's a 
fairy blithe and airy, 
She's as pretty as a

BIDDY THE BALLET GIRL. 
W ritten by J. BRADLEY, and sung with great success 
PAT ROONEY at Hairy Miner's New Theatre. 
I 
AM a 
gay laboring man, 
And I 
have a 
beautiful daughter, 
Who never Cid care much for work, 
It's her mother's own,wish that she oughtf4 
It seems that she fancied the stage, 
So I 
granted her final requests 
And now she a 
beautiful dancer, 
And ranks along with the best. 
CHORUS. 
On the stage she is Madame La Shortie, 
But her right name is Biddy McCarty, 
She brings home at night, and at matinees, 
Large baskets of flowers and also bouquets. 
Oh, she is my only daughter, 
And I 
am the man that taught her 
To wear spangled clothes, and go round on her toes, 
And there is no such a 
girl as Biddy. 
When salary day does arrive, 
All trouble and toil it does smother, 
For just the day before that there was a 
kick, 
The girl had been scolded by her mother; 
She's courting a 
clerk in the bank, 
Who sees her safe home at the door, 
And pays a 
big gang in the gallery, 
To applaud in a 
perfect uproar. 
On the stage, etc. 
Last Saturday night I 
got paid; 
I 
thought I 
would go to the theater, 
And take the old woman along; 
In the parquette in front I 
did seat her. 
When Iiiddy came out for to dance, 
My son Danny was up in the tier; 
He cried " Go in, sister Biddy," 
When they bounced him right out on his ear.

MY MARY ANN. 
Written for Miss KITTIE 
O'NEIL, by ED. HARRIGAN.. 
On! My Mary Ann is an artizan, 
In a 
factory ' way down town, 
She makes umbrellas for the high-toned fellers, 
And she lives six stories from the ground, 
In a 
brick tenement, where they cut up devilment 
Every night in the week and every day. 
My sweet Mary Ann walks out upon the sand, 
Ev'ry summer at Rockway. 
Her big brother Dan is a 
laboring man, 
On the pipes he's a 
civil engineer, 
His feet are as large as a 
picnic barge, 
He wears gum drops in his ears, 
He has a 
voice like a 
thrush, and he feeds on mush, 
He's fond of his sister, they say. 
Sweet Mary Ann walks out upon the sand, 
With her big brother Dan at Rockaway 
Sweet Mary Ann plays the grand plan, 
She never studies notes from the book, 
The music clear lays all in her ear, 
As she rattles it off with her hands. 
Snndays nights, when the parlor's full, 
And dear Camelia May will you give me a 
welcome 
here ° 
Then sweet Mary Ann walks out upon,the sand, 
Every summer on the beach at Rockaway.

Written by Tiros. DALY. 
IN 
the summer when the birds begin to sing, 
And the pretty notes from their yellow throats, 
Make the valley and woodland ring, 
Down by a 
little running stream. 
In a 
neat white cot, down in a 
shady dell, 
There lives a 
fairy queen; 
She is the fairest maid, there is beneath the sun, 
Is my Evangeline. 
CHORUS. 
In the summer when the birds begin to sing, 
And the pretty notes from their yellow throats. 
Makes the valley and the woodland ring, 
wed ray sweet Evangeline. 
Now of all the sweetest creatures in the land, 
Ever the sweetest one, yes, the dearest one; 
And 
happy be whene'er I 
gain the hand, 
Of my pretty sweet Evangeline. 
For she is such a 
bell, and always looks so well, 
And mine she'll surely be, 
I'm as happy as a 
king, or a 
bird upon the wing; 
And I 
sing and dance with glee. 
In the summer, etc.

I 
went down to Goerck street 
To a 
nice little surprise party, 
And the charmer that I 
met there was 
The darling, Biddy McCarthy. 
'Now Biddy was the finest girl, 
And the amusement of the party, 
Says I, I'm surely dead in love 
With the darling, Biddy McCarthy. 
CHORUS. 
With me tra-la-lee, now don't you see, 
I'm gone on Biddy McCarthy. 
(
Repeat) 
We danced the polka " mazourka,” 
Likewise the dizzy lancers, 
And as we moved around the floor 
We were two darling dancers. 
Says Biddy sure I 
feel afraid 
That I'll have to shake the party, 
I 
says wait awhile until I 
smile, 
And I'll go home with you Biddy McCarthy.

went home to Biddy's house 
A 
laughing, talking, chatting, 
I 
met her father at the door 
All out of breath a

Says he. now Biddy where did you get this, 
Did you get him at the party ? 
Oh, yes, your honor, was the reply 
From darling Biddy McCarthy. 
With me tra-la-lee, etc. 
I 
am happy now. I

Away across the water. 
My mother-in-law she calls on me, 
She is a 
roaring tartar, 
Her husband as well is like a 
bull, 
But I 
love my Biddy McCarthy. 
Sung by JOHN ROACH. 
MY bark of life was tossing down the troubled 
stream of time, 
When first I 
saw your smiling face, when youth 
was in its prime; 
My days of darkness turned to light, my sorr.ow'd 
heart was free, 
Oh, since that time I've always found you've.been 
a 
friend to me. 
Chorus. 
I'll ne'er forget where'er I 
roam, 
Whatever I 
may be, 
If ever I 
had a 
friend, 
You've been a 
friend to me. 
Misfortune nursed me as her child, and. fondly 
loved me, too, 
I 
would have had a 
broken heart, had it not been 
for you; 
Kind words were whispered soft and sweet, but 
glad I 
could not be, 
Until I 
found that you had been a 
faithful friend 
to me. 
I'll ne'er forget, etc. 
The light of hope from your bright eyes dispelled 
the clouds of strife, 
And threw their rays of sunshine down my weary 
path of life; 
I 
now look back upon the past, along life's stormy 
sea, 
I 
smile to think 'mid all life's scenes, you've been 
a 
friend to me.

Yes, my love, we're growing old— 
Silver threads among the gold 
Shine upon our brows to-day ! 
Life has lost its bl000ming May ! 
Still your eyes so fondly beam ; 
Time flows onward like a 
dream ! 
What though dark the days may be, 
You are always young to me. 
CHORUS. 
Yes, my love, we're growing old— 
Silver threads among the gold 
In our fading locks we see ; 
But you are always young to me. 
Days may come and days may go, 
But our hearts will fondly glow ; 
For the past we've no regret, 
Since the hour when first we met ; 
Lay your hand in mine once more, 
Every dream of youth restore ! 
Still your words are melody ; 
You are always young to me. 
Yes, my love, etc. 
Down the bill of life we stray, 
Soon will come the parting day ; 
O'er the river dark and lone 
We shall meet again, my love! 
Still we journey, hand-in-hand 
To the brighter, better land ; 
In your eyes my heav'n I 
see ; 
You are always young to me. 
Yes, ray love, etc, 
YOU AND I. 
WE 
sat by the river, you ana 
In the sweet summer time long ago 
Smoothly the waters glided by, 
Making music in its tranquil flow ; 
We threw two leaflets. you and. I, 
To the river as it wander'd on, 
And one was rent and left to die, 
And the other floated forward all alone. 
And. oh! we were sadden'd, you and I, 
For we felt that our youth's golden dream 
Might fade, and our lives be sever'd soon, 
As the two leaves were parted in the stream. 
'Tis years since we parted, you and I, 
In that sweet summer time, long ago, 
And I 
smile as I 
pass the river by, 
And I 
gaze into the shadow depths below; 
I 
look on tho grass and bending reeds, 
And I 
listen to the soothing song, 
And I 
envy the calm and haPpy life 
Of the river as it sings and flows along; 
For, oh! how its song brings back to me 
The shade of our youth's golden dream, 
In the days ere we parted you and 1, 
As the two leaves were parted in the stream.

LisrEN to the watermill, through the livelong day, 
How the clicking of its wheel wears the hours away, 
Languidly the autumn wind stirs the greenwood leaves ; 
From the fields the reapers sing, binding up the sheaves ; 
And a 
proverb haunts my mind, as a 
spell is cast— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Autumn winds revive no more leaves that once are shed, 
And the sickle cannot reap corn once gathered ; 
And the rippling stream flows on, tranquil, deep, and still, 
Never gliding back again to the watermill. 
Truly speaks the proverb old, with a 
meaning vast — 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Take the lesson to thyself, loving heart, and true ; 
Golden years are fleeting by ; youth is passing, too ; 
Learn to make the most of life lose no happy day, 
Time will never bring thee back chances swept away ; 
I.eave no tender word unsaid, love, while love shall la.st-
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Work while yet the daylight shines, man of strength and will, 
Never does the streamlet glide useless by the mill ; 
Wait not till to- morrow's sun beams, upon the way, 
All that though canst call thine own lies in thy—to- day ; 
Power, intellect, and health may not always last— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
3h! the wasted hours of life that have drifted by ; 
Oh ! the good we might have done lost without a 
sigh! 
Love that we might once have saved by a 
single word 
Thoughts conceived, but never penned, perishing, unheard. 
Take the proverb to thine heart, take and hold it fast— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
lb ! 
love thy God and fellow-man, thyself consider last ; 
For come it will, when thou must scan dark errors of the past ; 
And when thp tight of life is o'er, and earth recedes from view, 
And Heaven in all its glory shines, ' midst the pure, the gcod s 
the true --
Then you'll see more clearly the proverb deep and vast— 
The mill will nev r

W ALKING Out on Sunday I 
think very nice, 
What I 
would dispense with, not at any price; 
So when the weather's proper, 'm 
ready in a 
trice, 
To take my usual walk out on Sunday. 
A 
drive out in a " trap " now some folks seem to 
prize, 
But the exercise of walking I 
would 'illicit advise, 
And oh, such funny sights, and oh, such horrid 
guys 
You meet with when you're walking out on 
Sunday. 
Cleor. 
Walking out on Sunday in the afternoon, 
Crawling out on Sunday in the afternoon, 
Driving out on Sunday in the afternoon, 
It's awful jolly walking out on Sunday. 
Now there's Augustus Tompkins, a 
very heavy 
. 
swell, 
He manages to live somewhere on Murray Hill, 
You'd take him for a 
banker or a 
broker down on 
Wall street, 
When lie crawls out to do his walk on Sunday. 
With his silver-headed cane, and a 
glass stuck in 
one eye, 
lie twirls his fine mustache, wnich suspicious looks 
of dye, 
In fact you seldom see so elegant a 
guy, 
As Tompkins when he's crawling out on Sunday.

Ain—Remember You Have Children of Your Own. 
Sung by TONY PASTOR, at his own Theatre, Bro.adway with 
great success. 
From beneath those sunny skies, 
Where the summer never dies. 
ItVhere Mississippi sweeps its lenghts along , 
Borne North on every gale, 
Comes a 
sad and plaintive wail, 
That does its own sad misery prolong. 
It calls on us to hear, 
How the brethren we hold dear, 
Are b3ttling sore with hunger and with want 
How hope gives way to fear, 
As they see approaching near 
The spectre of the Fever grim and gaunt. 
They call on us to save, 
And the bounty that they crave, 
The North gave as it would in days of yore. 
They are brothers in distress, 
And heaven the North will bless, 
.Tor it gave as tho' there'd never been a 
war, 
Fair Memphis droops her head, 
'Tis a 
city of the dead, 
That was once the proudest in the land. 
Her soul's with sorrow filled, 
Her nerveless arm is chilled, 
Her parched brow by the fever blast is fanned. 
Then, from the woods of Maine, 
To each distant western plain, 
Send forth your answer to her sobbing moan. 
And unto others do, 
As you'd have them do to von, 
For remember that her fate may be our own. 
When the stake is death or life. 
Who would think of " section's" 'e 
rife, 
While brothers heart are bleeding to the core? 
Think of those not far away, 
To whom sorrow comes each day, 
And give as tho' there'd never been a 
wax.

Were steady and upright, 
But now in sporting spend their time, 
And in it much delight ; 
They drive about fast teams, 
On the governor's money, too, 
It shocks me quite, I 
don't know how, 
They do it, but—they do.

Young ladies now are not 
Like those I

THE SHIP THAT NEVER RETURNED. 
Composed and sung by GEO. S. 
SOBER. 
ON 
a 
summer day as the waves were rippling, 
By the soft gentle breeze ; 
Did a 
ship set sail with her cargo laden, 
For a 
port beyond the seas. 
There were sweet farewells, there were loving signals, 
And the fate was yet unlearned ; 
Though they knew it not, 'twas a 
solemn party 
• On the ship that never returned,

Did she never return, 
She never returned, 
And her fate is yet unlearned, 
Though for years and years there were fond one's 
watching. 
For the ship that never returned. 
Said a 
feeble lad to his anxious mother, 
I 
must cross the wide wide sea; 
For thcy say perchance in a 
foreign climate, 
There is health and strength for me. 
'Twas a 
gleam of hope in a 
maze of danger, 
And her hunt for her youngest earned, 
Though she sent him forth with a 
smile and blessing, 
On the ship that never returned. 
Did she never return, etc. 
Only one more trip, said a 
gallant seaman, 
As he kissed his weeping wife ; 
Only one more boy of the golden treasure, 
And will last us all through life. 
There we'll spend one day in our cozy cottage, 
And enjoy the sweet rest we earned ; 
But, alas ! poor man, who sailed commander, 
On the ship that never returned. 
Did she never return, etc.

Come and fill the groves with song, 
Make the orchards white with bloom,

ONE day while walking down Broadway, 
I 
met my cousin Joe, 
He asked me then if I 
with him 
To the Central Park would go. 
With my consent we then did start, 
And reached the lake at three, 
We 
took a 
sail, and words of love 
Were pass'd by Joe and me, 
CHORUS. 
Sailing on the lake, 
To the music of the birds, 
The rippling of the waters 
And sounds of loving words. 
On our return we took a 
stroll, 
And soon did reach the mall 
When from the distance music sweet 
Upon our ears ,did fall. 
We sat and listened to the band, 
Beneath a 
hawthorn tree, 
While gentle breezes carried words 
Of love from Joe to me. 
Sailing on the lake, etc. 
Now Joe has asked me to be his, 
Of course I 
won't refuse, 
And Pa has given his consent— 
This chance I 
must not loose. 
And when some day at Central Park 
The lake you go to see, 
I 
know you'll whisper words of love 
Like my dear Joe and me.

Copyright, 1877, by E. H. Harding. 
Is your path thro' life each day, 
You will meet upon the way, 
Fellow mortals upon whom this world cloth frown, 
Who from poverty or crime, 
Have fallen in their time, 
Or by circumstances crushed and stricken down. 
Young man with blighted names, 
Who once had noble aims, 
Young girls with shame and sorrow on their brow, 
Whom a 
kindly word might save 
From a 
dark, dishonored grave, 
While a 
cruel one would drive to madness now. 
They were once to some one dear, 
So don't pass them with a 
sneer, 
But speak a 
kindly word in cheering tone, 
You know not what's in store 
For the loved ones 'you. adore— 
,
e--
Remember you have ehildren of your own. 
The shop girls on the street, 
With as much respect should meet, 
As the millionaire, who in his carriage rolls ; 
And the honest laboring man, 
With his strong and horny hand, 
They, too, have hearts, yes, and souls.

Though no doubt from care and strife. 
Or some sorrow of his life, 
Has fallen, but not quite beyond recall. 
And the poor outcast forlorn, 
Don't pass her by with scorn, 
But speak unto her with a 
gentle tone; 
Perhaps she's not to blame 
For her life of sin and shame— 
Remember you have children of your own. 
Don't despise the wretched poor, 
Who perhaps grim want may lure, 
To steal the bread their starving children crave ; 
Be not the one to blame, 
You yourself would de the same; 
With strarvation at your door you'd dare the grave ; 
Their family is as der, 
To them as any here; 
Tho' their clothes may be all ragged, torn and old ; 
Dejected and forlorn, 
Yet still their hearts are warm, 
Though they lack the rich man's cheerful home and 
gold. 
They are all to some one dear, 
So don't pass them with a 
sneer, 
But speak a

You know not what's in store

A 
rose so bright and fair. 
With all her mother's loving ways: 
Her eyes and golden hair, 
Her eyes and golden hair. 
What wonder to his lonely heart 
Crept back the love of old. 
But autumn may not wed with spring, 
He cherished it untold ; 
But autumn may not wed with spring, 
He cherished if untold. 
One day there came a 
seemly knight 
To woe her from his side, 
The old man smiled upon him; 
For her sake, his joy and pride, 
His joy and his pride. 
But fickle was the knight and falss) 
(A story threadbare old), 
He woo'd her for a 
little while, 
Then wed for land and gold. 
A 
blighted flower can bloom no more, 
The old man wept one day, 
As murmuring the name she lov'd, 
His darling pass'd away, 
As murmuring the name she 
His darling, his darling, his darling, pass'd 
away. 
PALLET OF STRAW. 
Words by EDWARD W ISE: 
Air—'' Over the hills to the Poor no-use." 
Pm sitting alone in a 
garret, 
While the sleet and the snow's falling down, 
Yet God knows I 
am hungry and dying, 
And I'm waiting for Jessie to come ; 
I 
sent her out early this mot thug, 
To bring me some pennies or bread ; 
But I 
think when my litVe one comes, 
She'll find that her mother is dead. 
CHORUS. 
Pal cold, and Pm hungry and helpless, 
And my loved one I'll never see ;
ore, 
For I'm dying alone in a 
garret, 
On a 
thin little pallet of straw. 
Would to God that my child had a 
father, 
Or some one to watch o'er her with care ; 
Or some kind-hearted friend to protect her, 
Then I'd die without sorrow or fear ; 
Should the storm keep my child from returnins 
To her mother, so helpless and sore ; 
Who is sitting alone in her garret. 
On a 
thin little pallet of straw. 
Pm cold, and I'm hungry and helpless, 
And my loved one I'll never see more; 
For I'm dying alone in a 
garret, 
On a 
thin little pallet of straw. 
When I 
parted with Jessie this morning 
She kissed me good by, and she said, 
" 
I 
SODll shall return, dearest mamma, 
hether I 
get pennies or bread ;" 
I3ut the night's coming on and I'm weaker, 
And I 
think I'll see Jessie no more; 
For when she comes back she will find me 
Lying dead on my pallet of straw. 
Cnouus. 
She parted from cold and from hunger; 
And her loved one she'll never see more ; 
For she's lying dead up in a 
garret, 
On a 
thin little pallet of straw. 
OLD GRIMES' CELLAR DOOR. 
How oft we talk of childhood joys, 
Of tricks we used to play, 
While playing bookey from the school, 
All the livelong day. 
And oh I 
my eyes how I 
have longed, 
For those bright days of yore, 
When Sally Brown and I 
slid down 
Old Grimes' Cellar Door. 
CHORUS. 
! 
I 
would give all my greenbacks, 
For those bright days of yore, 
When Sally Brown and I 
slid flown 
Old Grimes' Cellar Door. 
Some boys would stealing apples go, 
While others used to stray; 
Down on the docks where sugar casks, 
In rows together lay: 
But Sal and I 
would seek the spot, 
So dear to us of yore; 
And side by side together slide 
Down Old Grimes' Cellar Door. 
But alas a 
change came o'er the scene, 
When poor old Grinaesy died; 
His son removed the cellar door, 
On which we used to slide. 
Our mothers they were glad of it, 
For our pantaloons we tore ; 
They had to be half-soled and heeled, 
From sliding on the door. 
One day the old man fell asleep, 
Upon his cellar door; 
The boys all came to take a 
peep, 
And hear him loudly snore. 
They tickled his nose with feather and straw 
And laughed till their sides were sore, 
The old man awoke with a 
loud haw ! Law ! 
And slid down on his own e;_•Ilar door,

But with truest friends, darling, there we will be, 
So, Mollie dear, Mollie deer Come then with me ! 
Come, Come, etc

Ould Father Maguire for these two hour has been, 
And I've got the ring, so Cushla Machree,
