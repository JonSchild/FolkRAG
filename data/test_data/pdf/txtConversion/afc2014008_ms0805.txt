Dear Richard Kurin:
 
3800 North Fairfax Dr.  #410
 
Arlington,  Va.  22203
 
March 20,  1995
 
I worked with Dr.  Peter Seitel for approximately a year and a
 
half  (June  1975 -
 December  1976)  helping prepare the
 
Smithsonian Bi-Centennial Festival of American Folklife.  We
 
have since maintained casual professional contact,  mostly at
 
subsequent Festivals and occasional in-house Smithsonian
 
meetings.  I have read his book,  See So That We May See and
 
such articles as appeared in several FAF program books.
 
Otherwise,  I am assessing his professional accomplishments on
 
the basis of the C. V.  you enclosed which I understand he
 
prepared in anticipation of such review.
 
In your letter of March 4 requesting my participation in the
 
review process,  you cite four areas  for assessment:
 
Research. Dr.  Seitel appears to have directed his
 
research towards two primary topics.  The first,  occupational
  
folklore was his area of interest when I first knew him as
 
program coordinator for the Transportation presentation in
 
1976.  In  1977,  he edited a book on the Labor Press:  Ring Like
  
Silver,  Shine Like Gold. His  interests apparently shifted
 
somewhat  for he did little other work in this area until  1984
 
when he researched and presented Alaskan occupational
 
folklore at that  summer's Festival.
 
A long-standing interest  in discourse and
  
narrative, especially in connection with traditional verbal
 
forms,  appears to have absorbed most of his attention.  Here
 
he has confined himself almost totally to his field work with
 
the Haya people of Tanzania,  the basis  for his  1972 PhD
 
dissertation and his  later book,  See So That We May See
  
(
1982),  an imaginative and complex book of high scholarly
 
quality.  Since  its publication he has produced one book-
length manuscript  (unpublished and currently withdrawn for
 
revision)  on Haya discourse;  another,  still  in preparation,
 
will contain eight Haya epic ballads.  In 1986,  1987,  and
 
1988,  he gave three  invited scholarly papers using the Haya
 
materials,  none of which are in publication.
 
I have no question about Dr.  Seitel's
 
scholarly abilities;  to me,  a serious and central problem is
 
that he has  limited hmself almost entirely to a specialized
 
group of materials and has not  succeeded in making his
 
conclusions generally available.  His overall work therefore
 
does not  really allow for much collegial evaluation.  It  is
 
possible,  of course,  his analyses could set new standards  for
 
this type of research,  but only a bit of evidence has accrued
 
so far.  It  is also disappointing that his research activities
 
appear to have decreased  (in terms of output)  during the
 
1980's and 1990's rather than increased,  as one would have
 
anticipated from a maturing scholar.
 
Collections. Dr.  Seitel has his Tanzanian research
 
materials,  as previously noted.  As  far as  I know they are in
 
his private possession and are adequately cared for;  I do not
 
know if any one else has ever asked to use them.  This
 
category would seem not especially applicable to Dr.  Seitel's
 
primary responsibilities.
 
Exhibition/Media. In addition to his direction of the
 
1976 Transportation presentation,  Dr.  Seitel  in 1982 acted as
 
folklore consultant to the year-long Smithsonian exhibit,
 
"Celebration:  a World of Art and Ritual",  guest-curated by
 
anthropologist,  Victor Turner,  for which he also edited a
 
small ancillary publication.  In  1985,  during his  five year
 
period as Director of the Office of Folklife Programs,  he
 
made scholarly contributions to the new theme of "cultural
 
conservation" demonstrated for the first time at the Festival
 
that year.  Since  1990 he has edited and co-edited the
 
Festival Program Book.  It  is possible that he has had
 
responsibility for the conception and/or execution of other
 
Festival programs but there is no written evidence for this,
 
and the impression I receive from his C. V.  is that he has
 
tended to remain remote from the general operations of the
 
Center for Folklife Programs and Cultural Studies,
 
Public Service: There is no real evidence in this C. V.
 
that Dr.  Seitel has participated in much community-based
 
public service,  although he has attended a number of
 
international and national conferences.  During his
 
Directorship,  he undoubtedly did work with many public
 
constituencies but he does not detail any of this,  nor is
 
there evidence that he directed the activities and energies
 
of the Office of Folklife Programs towards new or innovative
 
forms of public service.  He has given an unspecified number
 
of public and academic lectures and taught one course.
 
Overall,  though I find the quality of Dr.  Seitel's
 
writing high and his  research,  as  far as  I have seen it,
 
worthy,  I am disappointed at the meagre results of a more
 
than twenty-year career during which he has been free from
 
teaching and other academic distractions.  It  is difficult to
 
perceive  just where he has placed his energies,  and to what
 
purposes he has  dedicated his excellent education and skills.
 
Sincerely,
 
Bess Lomax Hawes

Richard  Kurin,  Director
 
Center for Folklife Programs
 
& Cultural  Studies
 
Smithsonian Institution
 
Washington,  DC  20560
 
Dear Dr.  Kurin:
 
I write today in response to your recent letter
 
requesting an assessment of Peter Seitel's professional
 
accomplishments.
 Having reviewed his CV,  and having read
 
several of his academic papers as well  as his articles
 
in Festival of American Folklife program books,  I suggest
 
that he has not performed at advanced conceptual  or
 
pragmatic leadership levels.
 
To begin:
 Dr.  Seitel's CV is unusually thin for
 
a GS-.14 level employee associated with the Smithsonian
 
Institution since  1974.
 In the arena of scholarship,  he
 
has continued to mine his  1972 thesis on Haya proverbs.
 
Within the Smithsonian,  he has paid particular attention
 
to occupational  folklife,  yet he has published no article
 
of substance--theoretical  or empirical  case study--in this
 
challenging field.
 
In reviewing Dr.  Seitel's writings and  festival
 
program activities,  I ask:
 How did the Tanzania  study
 
contribute to planning/staging the Festival  of American
 
Folklife?
 Tn  short,  where did personal  research  inform
 
institutional  practice?
 Similarly,  why have two decades
 
of concern with the experience of working people not  led
 
to learned-journal  articles  on occupational culture?
 How
 
does one explain  the consistent return  in academic
 
publication to a pre-Smithsonian thesis-subject without  a
 
parallel  turn to activity  involving yearly participation
 
by working people  in a Smithsonian festival?
 
Beyond the matter of subject choice and purpose
 
n scholarly writing,  I question Dr.  Seitel's professional
 
commitment to the development of public  folklife as a sub-
field  linking academic folklore,  arts/humanities  activity,
 
and public-agency administration.
 The  Smithsonian's pioneer
 
role  in opening this area  is  exemplary.
 One might  assume
 
that key  individuals  directing the Festival  of American
 
Folklife would accept an extra measure of responsibility
 
in refining public-folklife practice as well as  in firming
 
th
e o ry to undergird the field.

In reflecting upon Peter Seitel's CV and writings,
 
T conclude that he falls short of both university and museum
 
norms.
 Beyond these significant lacks,  he has  let down
 
colleagues engaged in sustaining and advancing the field of
 
public folklife.
 After long years of participation in campus
 
and public cultural programs,  I am at a loss to understand
 
why anyone privileged to work as a Smithsonian folklorist
 
would be content to march aimlessly under drab banners.

how occupational narratives taken in thematic sets define partic-
ular worlds with specific boundaries,  causalities,  social roles,
 
values,  and histories.
 
1986
 "The Discourse of violence in epic,"  invited paper for
 
panel on violence at the African Studies Association Meetings.
 
Based on an analysis of Haya epics about kings,  the paper
 
explores represented violence as a meaningful discourse,  with
 
styles and purposes associated with particular social roles.
 
1987
 "Mugasha  in the discourse of spirits:  political
 
resistance and religious co-optation in the Bachwezi cult in
 
Buhaya,"  invited paper for panel on myth at the African Studies
 
Association Meetings.
 A study of the epic of Mugasha,  the most
 
geographically wide-spread member of the Bachwezi pantheon in
 
eastern Africa.
 Worship of this god was co-opted by state-making
 
pastoral royalists in their struggle with indigenou€ patrilineal
 
clans,  but he is envisioned in the epic tradition as the embodi-
ment of,  among other things,  commoner resentment over social
 
inequalities expressed symbolically in hypergamous
, marriage and
 
assymetrical verbal greetings.
 
1988
 "Dialogue and discourse in informant-assisted transla-
tion,"  invited paper for panel on informant-assisted translation
 
at the American Anthropological Association Meetings.
 The paper
 
uses the above-mentioned key terms in the critical vocabulary of
 
Bakhtin in conceptualizing issues and methodology in the text-
oriented dialogue between informant and translator that informs
 
translations.

MARCHING DOWN FREEDOM'S ROAD: Songs from World War II
 
Compiled by Jeff Place and
. Guy Logsdon; annotated by Guy Logsdon
 
(The idea for this collection came from Jeffery Place.
 A
 
few years ago, when he and I were listening to and selecting
 
songs for the previously unissued Woody Guthrie songs
 
collection, Long Ways
 to Travel 1944-1949
  
Smithsonian/Folkways Recordings 40046, he suggested that we
 
not use any war songs for there were enough other artists in
 
the Moses Asch/Folkways Archives singing war songs to
 
justify a separate collection.
 He worked long hours in
 
ferreting out the songs and artists in this collection and
 
deserves recognition for his determination and perseverance.

INCLUDED -

The Second World War had a unifying effect on the United
 
States never seen before nor since.
 Occurring only eighty years
 
after the nation had been divided by civil war, it came as the
 
nation was slowly emerging from the Great Depression and
 
recovering from major drought in the mid-west, the bread basket
 
of the nation.
 Scars from the 1860s still remained as well as
 
scars from World War I
, but equally as troubling, the
 
depression/drought years eroded national pride.
 
The 1930s were devastating years for the self confidence of

Those who mourn the passing of the  "real" old musical
 
traditions  should take note of this book.  They will find
 
many old singing styles
 still with us,  some in altered
 
form,  some

lose to the way they
  
 
They will also find new approaches to God through song,  raw-
boned and unrefined sometimes,  but glorified by the vision
 
that has brought the people through

This  is an extraordinarily democratic publication,  evidencing
 
on every page the remarkable flowering of sacred song that

INTRODUCTION
 
by Henry Willett

 �

For some 200 years, communities and congregations from Athens
 
to Mobile have created, nurtured and sustained a variety of sturdy
 
and  joyful  sacred music  trad'tions of  immense beauty and power.
 
Folklorists and ethnomusicologists have long recognized Alabama's
 
sacred  music  traditions  as  among  the  state's  most  remarkable
 
cultural jewels.
 
Alabama's settlement in the early nineteenth century followed
 
closely the spread of religious revivalism,  known as the  "Great
 
Revival" or "Second Great Awakening," that swept across the South
 
in that period.
 The movement,  initiated by Tennessee preacher
 
James McGready's fiery sermons on a second Pentecost,  brought to
 
Alabama, through tent meeting services, evangelical Protestantism,
 
particularly among Baptists and Methodists.
 
This religious fervor renewed interest in sacred song.  Dozens
 
of songbooks, such as j
(entuc}çy Harmony, Uniqn Harmony and Southern
 
harmony, were  published,  and  found  widespread  popularity  at
 
religious  gatherings  throughout  the  state.
 The  sacred  music
 
repertoire  of  this  period  (
1800-1850)  was  comprised  mainly  of
 
psalms,  hymns  and  spirituals.
 The  second half  of  the  century
 
(
1850-1900) saw the spread of shape-note singing, particularly from
 
The Sacred Harp, across Alabama.  The twentieth century brought the
 
explosion  of  gospel  music,  in  its  many  forms,  with  Alabamians

playing major roles in the development of those musical styles.
 
Antebellum Alabamians sang the psalms and hymns of sixteenth
 
and  seventeenth  century  British  composers  and  eighteenth  and
 
nineteenth century American composers.  This period also witnessed
 
the development of African-American spirituals.
 
Events of history and culture combined to produce a unique
 
musical  tradition  in  Selma  -
-
 an African-American  congregation
 
preserving a music tradition with direct links to the psalmody of
 
sixteenth  century  Scotland.
 The  Reformed  Presbyterian  Church
 
maintains a 400 year-old music tradition,  holding to the belief,
 
based upon Biblical directive, that unaccompanied singing of texts
 
from the  Book  of  Psalms  is  the  only proper way  to  sing God's
 
praise.
 
Other  Alabama  congregations  have  preserved  sacred  music
 
traditions  with  origins  in  the  religious  music  of  Africa.
 
Spirituals,  first  recognized  in  the  early  nineteenth  century,
 
retain African emphases on vocal embellishment,  strong rhythmic
 
qualities,  hand-clapping percussion,  improvisation and call-and-
response.
 
An antecedent to spirituals, "moaning," is regularly practiced
 
in a number of African-American churches in Alabama.  During Sunday
 
devotional service at Spring Hill Baptist Church in Macon County's
 
Cotton Valley,  or at any one of scores of other churches across
 
Alabama,  the moving and plaintive sound of moaning can be heard.
 
Moaning is often a part of,  or interspersed with,  the lined-out
 
singing of "Dr. Watts" hymns.
 
"Lining  out,"  more  than  likely  evolving  as  a practical

solution to a lack of hymn books and literacy in both white and
 
black churches, is where a song leader sings or reads two lines of
 
a hymn, the congregation then repeating the lines in song.
 "Dr.
 
Watts"  refers specifically to the English composer Isaac Watts;
 
though, in fact, refers to any hymns sung in that particular style.
 
Typically written to be sung in simple meter (common meter,
 
long meter,  short meter,  etc.),  Alabama's African-American  "Dr.
 
Watts" adherants sing the hymns with abundant meliematic adornment,
 
counter-rhythm and improvised harmony.
 The effect is successive
 
waves of vocalization climbing one over the other.
 
A very different  style  of  hymn  singing is  found  in  those
 
Sacred Harp singings of which some 300 occur in Alabama every year.
 
Taking its name from the songbook The Sacred Harp, first published
 
in Hamilton, Georgia, in 1844, this style of singing predates the
 
actual  publication  of  the  book.
 By  the  eighteenth  century
 
religious songbooks were commonly employing shape-notes to indicate
 
the sounds on the then-popular English musical scale fa-sol-la-fa-
sol-la-mi-f
 a
.
 From the fuguing tunes of William Billings to the
 
popular  melodies  of  Jeremiah  Ingalls,  religious  songs  found
 
widespread circulation in shape-note hymn books such as 5outherq
 
Harmony and Social Har . 
It was in this setting that The gacrscl
 
harp made its appearance in Alabama in the mid-nineteenth century.
 
Taught by singing school masters to first sing the notes and
 
then the  lyrics,  that  practice  remains  to  this  day  a defining
 
characteristic of  this  a cappella tradition.
 Another  defining
 
characteristic is the practice of forming

 basses,
 
tenors, trebles and altos all facing one another.

Typically associated with white culture in the Deep South,
 
southeast Alabama has,  nevertheless,  enjoyed a vibrant African-
American Sacred Harp tradition for well over a century.
 Alabama
 
slaves might have  sung Sacred Harp with whites as  early as the
 
1850s, establishing segregated singings and conventions after the
 
Civil War.
 
The exceptional durability of Alabama's Sacred Harp tradition
 
is no doubt the result of the strong dedication of a number of
 
extended families -
-
 the woott ens of north Alabama's Sand Mountain
 
and the  Jacksons of southeast Alabama's Wiregrass region -
-
 who
 
have  taken  on  the  responsibility  of  keepers  of  this  cultural
 
tradition.
 
Similarly, the Deason family, of Bibb and Tuscaloosa Counties,
 
has played a key role in the nurturing of another important Alabama
 
shape-note  tradition,  Christian  Harmony.
 First  published  by
 
William Walker, who earlier had published the four-shape 5outheril
 
arrno y, 
Christian  Harmony, published  in  1866,
 employed  the
 
"modern" seven character note system do re -1
ni - fa-so1-1a tj_do.  It
 
also contained a number of newer, more contemporary compositions.
 
There  was  a time  when  the  two  traditions  competed  for
 
followers,  and,  in  the  end,  The  Sacred  Harp won  many  more
 
supporters.
 But,  as witnessed in the annual Capitol City Shape-
Note Singing, where both four-shape and seven-shape songs are sung,
 
there are now a number of singers who participate in and support
 
Sacred Harp singings and Christian Harmony singings.

While the early twentieth century brought the "Golden Age" of
 
Sacred Harp singing in Alabama,  it also brought a new style of
 
sacred music -
-
 gospel.
 
The roots of gospel music can be traced to the emergence of
 
camp meeting songs, revival
, music, and the incorporation of various
 
styles  of  secular  popular  music  in  the  religious  songbooks  of
 
increasingly sophisticated music publishers.  The James D. Vaughan
 
Publishing Company,  founded in Lawrenceburg,  Tennessee,  in 1903,
 
issued one or two new paperback songbooks a year, and, by 1
.912, was
 
averaging sales of nearly 100,000 books annually.
 
These books, printed in seven-shape notation, contained mostly
 
new  material  with  about  25  percent  of  the  pages  reserved  for
 
standards and old favorites.  To help promote and market the books,
 
Vaughan created a music institute in Lawrenceburg, where dozens of
 
Vaughan quartets were trained and then sent out to Alabama and
 
across the South to organize singing conventions, to teach singing
 
schools,  and,  of  course,  to  sell  songbooks.
 Vaughan  Boon  had
 
competitors, most notably from the Dallas-based Stamps-Baxter Music
 
and Printing Company, with its theme song "Give the World A Smile
 
Each Day."
 
The  direct  result  of  the  publishing  activity  of  Vaughan,
 
Stamps-Baxter and others are the dozens of community gospel singing
 
conventions, both white and black, found throughout Alabama.
 The
 
indirect  result  is  the profound  impact on the development of a
 
whole variety of gospel styles.
 
C.A.  Tindley,  considered by music historians to be the true
 
"father"  of African-American gospel,  was composing gospel  songs

during the first decade of the twentieth century; but, it was
 
Georgian Thomas A. Dorsey, composer of such standards as
 
"There Will Be Peace In The Valley," who became the giant of black
 
gaspsl in the 1930s.
 
A  certain  combustion  of  sacred  music  styles,  fueled  by
 
African-American migration  from Black Belt  tenant  farms  to the
 
mining and mill towns of Birmingham gave birth to a unique gospel
 
sound.
 The development of Jefferson County's   cApDel_14 gospel
 
quartet singing tradition, beginning in the first quarter of the
 
twentieth  century,  gave  rise  to  the  "Birmingham  sound,"  an
 
important and enduring contribution to American gospel music.
 
Combining the rich harmonies of the various university jubilee
 
singing groups (Fisk, Hampton, Tuskegee) with the style of Vaughan
 
quartets and elements of jazz and ragtime,  the Jefferson County
 
quartets discovered a vital new sound characterized by precise,
 
snappy timing and harmonies, a preaching style of lead singing, the
 
trading off of voice parts and a distinctive, percussive "pumping"
 
base.
 
Early  quartets  -
-
 the  Foster  Singers,  the  Dunham  Jubilee
 
Singers, the Famous Blue Jay Singers, the Heavenly Gospel Singers
 
and the Sterling Jubilees,  under the tutelage of extraordinarily
 
talented quartet trainers such as Son Dunham and Charles Bridges,
 
set a standard of excellence for other quartets to follow.
 
Through recordings, radio programs and live performances, the
 
"Birmingham  Sound"
 was
 exported  to
 other
 cities,
 further
 
influencing other singers and performers.
 And just as the early
 
quartets had borrowed from popular, secular music styles, popular

performers borrowed from the gospel quartets.  The sounds of the
 
Mills  Brothers,  the  Ink  Spots,  the  Platters,  Sam  Cooke,  the
 
Temptations and Boyz II Men are all legacies of the "Birmingham
 
sound."
 
A number  of  Birmingham's  older  gospel  quartets  are  still
 
active.
 The Sterling Jubilees, the Four Eagles and other groups
 
have  maintained  the  tradition's  standards  of  excellence  while
 
inspiring younger groups,  like the Birmingham Sunlights, who are
 
bringing fresh innovations to the music while remaining true to the
 
tradition's heritage.
 
The small town of St. Stephens, in southwest Alabama, has, in
 
recent years, earned a reputation as the center for the promotion
 
of  a  different  kind  of  gospel  Sound  -
-
 bluegrass  gospel.
 
Bluegrass, as a popular musical form, incorporates Southern string
 
band music with elements of  jazz,  blues and gospel.
 Its vocal
 
style is closely related to the gospel quartet style.
 
Since Bill Monroe first created bluegrass music in the early
 
1940s, gospel has been a part of its core repertoire,  The Sullivan
 
Family of Washington County, in their dedication to an exclusively
 
gospel repertoire, have earned the unofficial title "First Family
 
of Bluegrass Gospel Music."
 
A significant portion of the Sullivang'  repertoire is drawn
 
from the gospel compositions of the Louvin Brothers,  Charlie and
 
Ira, from the Sand Mountain town of Henagar.  This country brother-
duet was immensely popular in the 1940s and 1950s, and a number of
 
their songs have become bluegrass gospel standards.
 
Other bluegrass  gospel  bands,  the Maharreys  and Jerry and

Tammy Sullivan (both with connections to the Sullivan Family Band)
 
also make the St.  Stephens area of Washington County home.
 All
 
three bands have deep ties to the Holiness-Pentecostal faith,  w
ith
 
its  relatively unstructured,  emotional  atmosphere,  the Holiness
 
Church accepts a variety of music styles, and warmly embraces the
 
bluegrass gospel of the Sullivans and Maharreys.
 
Bluegrass  gospel  adds  one more  sound  to  the  polyphony
 
of
 
sacred  sounds which echo  across Alabama:
 the  sound of  Luella
 
Hatcher raising the "Dr. Watts" hymn, "A Charge to Keep I Have," at
 
Orrvilla's  Mt.  Mariah  Primitive  Baptist  Church;  the  sound  of
 
Japheth Jackson coming to the center of "the square" at the County
 
Line Church in Slocornb, or of Terry Wootten doing the same thing at
 
Antioch  Baptist  Church  in  Ider,  calling  out  "page  82,"  and
 
launching into  "Bound  for Canaan,"  a Sacred Harp favorite;  the
 
sound of Deacon Tim Menefee of Macon County's Spring Hill Church
 
quietly moaning "Uphill journey but I
'm on my way;" the sound of
 
Ernest Phillips as he  leads off the monthly meeting of the Lee
 
County Gospel Singing Convention at the Auburn Recreation Center;
 
the sound of John Alexander's Sterling Jubilee Singers performing
 
"God Shall Wipe All Tears Away" at the quartet's 65th anniversary
 
concert at the Bessemer City auditorium; the sound of song leader
 
Gregory Woodson as he leads Selina's Covenantere in the singing of
 
Psalm 95,  "0 Come and to Jehovah sing...."
 With voices raised,
 
these individuals,  and countless others,  serve as the keepers of
 
our cultural heritage.  In their sacred sounds is the legacy of the
 
Alabama experience.
