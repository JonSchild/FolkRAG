Mr. Alan Lomax, Assistant in Charge, Archive of American Folksong, Library of Congress,
Washington, D.C.
Dear Mr. Lomax:
I am sorry to have to report that the Writers' Project is no longer able to work with folklore
materials, and it would be impossible for us to make copies of the Florida recording
pictures.
A fairly comprehensive set of 5 × 7 prints was sent to the Library of Congress, and was
examined by Dr. Botkin and Mr. Seeger. I trust that you still have them on hand.
We have a considerable number of other photographs of Florida golk groups, such as
the Greeks, Negroes, Latins, Crackers, Conchs and Seminoles, but only a few of them
show recordings being made. If you can use such pictures, let us know the kinds you are
interested in. We can only loan you the prints, as we do not have the negatives.
Sincerely yours, Carita D. Corse Dr. Carita D. Corse, State Supervisor, Statewide Writers'
Project, Work Projects Administration, 49 West Duval St. Jacksonville, Fla.
