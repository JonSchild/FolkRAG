From off the monument.

The bird on the tree is singing his song, 
So sweetly to me the whole ev'ning long; 
flow happy and gay, how joyous and free, 
He is with his song, sweet bird on the tree. 
The daylight is fleeting, the moon shines above, 
'Tis time for our meeting, 0 
Cora, my love, 
To guide thee to me, dear, the woodlands along, 
The bird on the tree, dear, is singing ; is singing his songp 
ClIORUS. 
Then listen, then listen, then listen, then listen' 
The bird on the tree, dear, is singing his song, 
The bird on tree is singing his song? 
Yes, be calls, yes, he calls, 
He is calling for thee, 
He is calling for thee, 
Is the bird, is the bird on the tree, 
The bird on the tree sings carols so clear, 
His song full of glee now falls on mine ear ; 
Then haste to me, pray, I 
am waiting for thee, 
And fain would be gay like the bird on the tree, 
The blossoms are sleeping, the wind softly sighs, 
The fair stars are peeping above in the skies, 
To guide thee to me, dear, the woodlands along, 
The bird on the tree, dear, is singing, is singing his song,.

THE T.A .R.R SIDE SHORE 
Summer's. breath is lightly failing 
On the silent waters blue, 
And the moonbeams bright are sporting' 
With the drops of glittering dew. 
Hark ! a 
way upon the waters 
There's a 
sound of dipping oar, 
And a 
boat's song loudly chanted, 
Echoes down the lake-side shore. 
Now the night-bird's song comes floating 
Sweetly down the midnight air, 
Waking all the depths to listen 
To the bird that thus should dare 
Tohreak the weird and solemn stillness. 
That had reigned so long before, 
In the wood and mead, and valley, 
On the silent lake-side shore. 
Now the song comes swelling bolder, 
And the boatman's chant is heard 
Louder o'er the distant walers 
As if it would outvie the birds; 
But each song at last is finished, 
And the bird to rest once more, 
Leaves no sound to break the quiet 
Of the happy lake-side shore. 
Who can say there in no pleasure, 
Thus to walk the night alone, 
List'ning to the night-birds music, 
Or the boatmen's solemn tune ? 
Where is there a 
spot more lovely, 
Where the vail of night hangs o'er, 
Where another peace more holy 
Than this silent lake-side shore ?

So politely offered her my arm.

I've racers and hunters as well, 
Estates and lands in the country, 
So much money I 
cannot tell.

And neither spend money, or lend, 
For money well spent brings joys. 
Yes, money was made to spend. 
Chorus.—After the opera's, &c. 
After the opera's over, 
Belgravia could tell many tales, 
But as I 
am one of its people, 
It wouldn't be fair to drive nails; 
Suffice me to say that at night 
Nye dance, we sing, and we play; 
We " Upper Ten," with hearts so light, 
Thus merrily while time away. 
Chorus.—After the opera's, &e. 
After your business take pleasure, 
But business, by Jove, I've none, 
A

Why, hang it, I

Live in the squares of Belgravia, 
And the pleasures of life you'll see.

SHE'S THE LOVZ,LIEST GIP..1.1 I EVER SAW. 
11) ROLLIN HOWARD. 
I 
was in the public garden the other afternoon, 
I 
saw a 
lovely tnaiden, who passed me very soon, 
The place seemed like an Eden, myself I 
could not contain, 
I 
asked her where she was going, and she said to see the foun-
tain. 
CII(
)RUS. 
She's the loveliest girl I 
ever saw, 
She's touched my heart's fond chord, 
And the prettiest girl I 
ever saw, 
She is, upon my word. 
She was dressed so gay and nobby, and then so sweet she'd 
talk, 
I 
told her it was toy hobby to take fin evening walk, 
She said she'd take one with me, and pleased I 
was, you bet, 
She seemed I 
think to love me, but I 
have not offered vet. 
She's the loveliest girl I 
ever saw, dtc. 
But on Sunday next I'm going, all dressed up in my best, 
To ask her if she's willing to answer my request, 
And that will be to have me, so never more to part, 
If from her soul she loves me, she'll be queen of my heart. 
She's the loveliest girl I 
ever saw, (4.:c.

A YEAR OR TWO AGO. 
Ant.—" Twenty years ago." 
I've wandered near the gin mill, Totn, 
The gin mill on the hill, 
Whero everything lo , ked once so gay, 
flint pow looks dark and still. 
The shurters were all up, dear Tom, 
The s'gn swung to and fro, 
Its music sounds just as it did 
A year or two ago. 
You I:new the man who kept it, Tom, 
MeGinness was his name; 
He always used to treat us right, 
Both you and I 
the same. 
But now he's dead and gone, dear TOM, 
And in his grave laid low; 
We'll no more " tick" him as we did 
A year or two ago. 
You know, dear Tom, we often spent 
Such happy hours there ; 
Both von and I 
at drinking gin 
Were, counted pretty fair. 
'We always used to ' hang it up," 
We hever paid. you know, 
Oh, these were jolly times we had 
A year or two ago. 
One Sunday night, some time ago, 
As we sat drinking gin, 
Somebody rapped upon the door, 
A 
rid said, " Come, let tin' in." 
It proved to he the exeisem an , 
And Mac was caught, you know, 
His license then they did revoke, 
A year or two ago. 
When Mac found out the oxei-zema rt 
Would not license him again, 
lie took to drink arol dh ,r1 quite. soon, 
Of " Bourbon on the brain." 
And now the plaee is eloscd, dear Torn, 
The pigs roam to and In, 
All through the spot where we got tight, 
A year or two ago. 
IMP 
THE JERSEY LOVERS. 
Of a 
heart-rending trad-gi-dy, 
A story I 
will tell, 
Concerning a 
maid nam'd Sari Jane,: 
And a 
youth called Sam-u-el. 
They loved each other tenderly, 
And the Jersey people said, 
That " before the cruel war was o'er 
These lov-i-ers would be wed." 
One day, as Sam was taking a 
walk, 
By the Elysian Fields, it seems, 
lie spied his charming Sari Jane 
Walking with his rival, Jeems. 
He jumped and raved upon the grassr,-
And his golden locks he tore, 
Saying, " Fare you well, my Sari Jane, 
You ne'er shall see me more." 
Then he ran down by the river-side, 
But being out of breath, 
H e fell down on a 
big data shell, 
And scraped himself to death. 
'When Sari Jane she heard of this, 
She gave a 
piercing squall, 
Then tied a 
grindstone round her neck, 
And jumped in the raging canawl.

HUNTING SONG. 
List to the merry 1 
.
11tilt ing _ torn, 
O'er Idd and dale its echo flies, 
Waking up the drowsy morn, 
As toe sim looms in the skies. 
Vault into saddle and away, 
'10 saddle and away, 
The chase admits of no delay, 
Admits of leo delay. 
Off to the meet, to cover start, 
Whip, crack, the course is clear, 
Let whip and splx do their part, 
To follow fox or deer. 
CHORUS. 
Whip, crack, the course is clear, 
'Whip, crack, the hounds forward cheer, 
Whip, crack, after lox or deer, 
A 
hunter knows no fear. 
Spoken — Out of nest into 
saddle, toes in, heels out, crack 
thong, give !wad rein, over the down for some ups and downs. 
In the hounds dash the brush wood among, 
Sly Reynard is quaking with fears, 
The first of the pack old Towler gives tongue, 
lie breaks cover as Reynard appears, 
A burst ! leiter skelter we go . 
Whip a 
run! spur, dash onward, we push, 
hark forward voax ! tally-ho ! 
Neck or nothing fir winning the brush. 
At ox-renco, gate or hedge ‘Ne dash, 
At. a 
flying leap we clear, 
In river, pooi or stream we splash, 
Onward the hounds we cheer. 
Whip, crack, dn. 
Up with the hounds away we go, 
The scent laying full- breast high, 
To the view hallo 
Hark, tally-ho 
We echo the huntsman's cry. 
Horses and hounds now pant for breath, 
Fagged, they pant for breath, 
lie's fairly run down, up rind in at the death. 
We'll up and in at the death. 
To crack the off on I 
push, 
Whip, smack, my course is clear, 
And in inv cap I 
mount the brush, 
To a 
rattling tally- ho cheer. 
Whip, crack, Arc. 
LIFE IS A RIVER. 
Oh ! Lire is the river, and man is the boat 
That over its surface is destiti'd to float, 
And ji IVis the cargo so easily stor'd 
That be is a 
fool who sorrows on board. 
We all have a 
taste of the ups and the downs, 
As Fortune dispenses her smiles and her frowns ; 
But may we not hope that if she's frowning to-day, 
That to- morrow she'll lend us the light of her ray. 
I 
would not that Man without caution should steer, 
From the quicksands— the rocks that encircle him here ; 
Be Honor his compass—the Magnet his breast, 
Let him stand to Truth's course, and to Fate leave the rest. 
There's plenty of sunshine; then why choose the shade? 
Half the clouds that come o'er us, our own fears have made. 
When go right-a- head, and there's Joy's smiling bay, 
Why run from our course to meet trouble ha,f way? 
'Would summer be priz'd for its fruit and its flow'rs, 
If winter ne'er follow'd with storm- winds and showers ? 
And does not the brightest of pleasures appear, 
Still brighter when checquer'd by moments of care? 
I 
ask not for gold—are there virtues hi wealth 
So dear to the heart as contentment and health ! 
Oh ! give me but these, nought can add to my store; 
Without them tho' riches are mine, I 
am poor. 
THINKING OF OLD FRIENDS. 
Thinking of old titres, hopes ne'er to be, 
Dreaming of old friends far o'er the sea, 
Distance can change not dear friends like you, 
Fortune estrange not kind friends so true; 
Thus in the twilight fond thoughts will stray 
Back to the old times and homes far away. 
Oh, ' mid the old scenes I 
no more see, 
is there a 
kind thought ever for me 
If there's but one wish—one hope, though vain, 
If there's but one sigh, I'll not complain. 
Thus in the twilight, tears oft will stray 
Back to the old times and homes far away.

THE SONG OF SONGS. 
A IR—" Cottage by the Sea." 
Childhood's days now pass before me, 
When this old hat was new, 
We are coining sister Mary, 
Have you seen the boys in blue? 
tiet me kiss him for his Mother, 
Underneath the Greenwood Tree, 
Come where my love lies dreaming, 
In the cottage by the Sea. 
Fancy painted Old Bob Ridley 
Going home to Dixey's land 
Arm-in-arm with Billy Pattison, 
Who wouldn't give his Heart without his Hand, 
Unless he married Old Aunt Sally 
Then how happy he would be, 
The Ship's on Fire, so Man the Lifeboat, 
In the Cottage by the Sea. 
If your Mother keeps a 
Mangle, 
Then No Irish Need Apply! 
In Tara's Hall's the Irish Emigrant,

The Cure he c

Who said, " Come Back Peter Gray ;" 
And the Young Man from the Country, 
Was caught ill-using Old Dog Tray.

As we parted at the gate. 
A little heart that longing waits 
To know what next

A little face that shyly looks

Oh ! why is your bark thus at rest?"

But I 
don't like to venture alone,

Jut half in despair, kr. 
There's mans' a

There's many a 
pleasure I 
miss; 
it vexes Inc most to confess, 
I'm in such a 
dilemma as this. 
Oh ! were I 
in Congress to- day, 
I'd use every effort I 
know ; 
To make it the law of the land, 
To provide every girl with a 
beard 
I'm half in despair, 
I 
declare, I 
declare, 
Ittronbles and vexes me so. 
To think there's no cure, 
But to wait and endure, 
As we must who haven't a 
beau, beigho! 
Won't somebody send me a 
bean? 
I'm half in despair, & u. 
Am.—" Learned Man." 
By thus addressing the fair sex, 
I. hope I 
to one hero shall vex, 
'Tis to advise and lot perplex, 
If youll listen to my plan. 
It is to aid in your great cause, 
To assist in your rights and laws, 
To rectify the slips and flaws 
Von often meet from nian. 
First you can't be too particular 
In all you say and du, 
Fut down just half of 
What men say as true. 
Another to 
bear in mind, 
Don't he too distant or too kind, 
Be not to your own feelings blind, 
But still beware of man. 
If men flatter, vow and swear, 
Affect the pangs of deep despair, 
Girls, of such a 
mall beware, 
Let this be your plan. 
Laugh at all he does and says, 
Vow you detest such childish ways, 
With all your judgment scan. 
If he have true love, 
lie will throw these airs aside, 
If he's all deception, 
You g-a.1 and wound his pride. 
If this should answer, in the end 
You gain the lover and a 
friend, 
Or else a 
roeue and fool offend--
But still beware of man. 
Girls. if a

try, 
Which you may see with half an eye, 
'To true love don't the truth deny, 
Don't be slow and shy.

And so it is with man. 
MOONSTRUCK. 
There's a 
sweet one that I've often seen— 
A form and face divine, 
Her style is dashing—just the tiling; 
I 
tlrink her most sublime. 
Her charms so fascinated me, 
That I 
in love did fall; 
And since that time she's been to me, 
The dearest one of all. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, I 
cannot live without her, 
And I 
always dream about her, 
I 
have had no peace of mind, 
Since I 
in love did fall ; 
And ever since she's been LO 
ITHe 
The dearest one of all. 
She's dearer far than life to me, 
This dearest, darling one, 
And when her smiling face I 
see, 
With joy I'm overcome. 
How lone is single life to me, 
Since I 
in love did fall, 
For my heart has flown to her I 
think 
The dearest one of all. 
I'll ask this dear one to be mine, 
To cling to me through life; 
And if she will consent to be 
My darling little wife 
I'll prove to her my love so true, 
And in her mind install, 
And she through life shall over be 
The dearest one of all, 
Oh, I 
cannot live without, tte. 
THE HOLLY. 
A 
traveler have I 
been from birth, 
A traveler must I 
be, 
Yet ne'er I 
saw the tree on earth 
That's like the holly tree. 
Beneath the palm I've found relief, 
Beneath the great banyan, 
But nothing's like the holly leaf 
Unto an Englishman. 
CLIORUS. 
The holly, the holly, with berries red, 
That garlands the snows of old winter's head. 
The cedar is a 
mighty thing, 
It formed the temple's roof, 
The oak it is a 
forest king, 
With trunk of tempest proof. 
The cocoa cures a 
thirsty grief, 
As well as cup or can, 
But nought is like the holly leaf, 
Unto an Englishman. 
The laurel pays the poet's deeds, 
The laurel soldiers win, 
But lattice panes with holly beads 
As red as hearts within. 
To make the traveler's sorrows brief, 
'Fake off the pilgriin's ban— 
No, nowdit is like the holly bid 
Unto an Englishman.

STILL I AM NOT HAPPY.—NONCLUDED.1 
When big enough to go to school, they sent me far away, 
Where all was work and drudgery, and never any play; 
No marbles, tops, no kites or hoops allowed were, but such sums 
Were set us, and small exercise for our poor teeth and gums. 
We had of meat the smallest cut, of drink the weest drappie, 
I 
almost died from hunger, but—but still I 
was not happy. 
Before I 
left, as a 
reward for never telling lies, 
The stern head-master handed me a 
volume as a 
prize; 
'Twas bound in calf, with pages gilt, ' twas heavyish to lift; 
At length, thought I, is happiness, as I 
beheld the gift; 
All tremblingly I 
opened it, alas I 
this eager chap he 
Read Martin Farquhar Tupper's works, and still I 
was not happy. 
ENconn VERSES. 
Grown up I 
thought a 
doctor I'd eventually be; 
I 
changed my mind, and tried the law, and then the law tried me. 
I 
made the slightest of mistakes about a 
party's purse, 
The sentence passed upon me was ridiculously terse; 
They locked me up, cut off my hair, my " backy," and my rappee, 
And put me on the treadmill, where—where still I 
was not happy. 
I 
married three years back a 
wife, but found I'd been deceived, 
The property did not exist in which I 
had believed; 
Her mother pays short visits of just seven months or so, 
Her six big sisters come in turn, but never seem to go; 
Five brothers daily dine, and tell all new that's in the tapis. 
They kindly stop to tea as well, but still I 
am not happy. 
I've speculated right and left, in bank and railway shares, 
But in each instance have they proved most ruinous affairs. 
I 
always tread on orange peel, or slides made in the gutter, 
And if my bread and butter falls, it's always on the butter. 
I 
get run over in the street, and cabmen call me " sappy," 
I 
digest nothing that I 
eat, and still I 
am not happy. 
I've failed in trade—the doctor says I'm " going to be ill." 
To-morrow I 
must come to grief through backing Walker's " Bill." 
My pipes have burst, my chimney smokes, my rent's long overdue, 
There's one man in possession now, to-morrow there'll be two. 
But crowning bliss of all my wife has left off being snappy, 
And vows she'll " stick to me through life," but still I 
am not happy,

,  
One sultry summer morning, 
A year ago, or past, 
We met beneath an awning 
When it was raining fast; 
She looked so very s 
st eetly, 
As ne'er had lass before; 
I 
was in love completely 
&fore the rain was o'er. 
CILOn US 
She looked so very sweetly, 
As ne .er had la s 
before, 
I 
was in love completely 
Before the rain was o'er. 
I 
said ' twas quite a 
shower; 
'Tis so, the lass replied, 
And, for it full half hour, 
We chattod side by side; 
I 
found I 
knew her brother, 
And she had heard of mine, 
And, then—somehow or other— 
She asked me home to dine. 
She looked so very sweetly, dm 
Soon after, we were married, 
And sell led down in life ; 
And I 
have often tarried 
Where first I 
met my wife. 
And, though life's plea- ant morning 
Has dawned on us again, 
I'll ne'er forget tile a 
wiling— 
Nor that, sweet summer rain.

And front her hands a

Oh ! I'm in lave, I

Of her I 
ever dream. 
The first time that I

I 
turned about to see which way 
The little beauty went,

For in my heart I 
felt indeed 
Love's dart had there been sea. 
She was on the corner standing, 
And my courage I 
did try; 
I 
said I

knew her

You may talk, 
She smiled on me so sweetly 
Said I 
don't remember you, 
Oh I

_MANAGE YOUR OWN CANOE.. 
Some silly girls for husbands do sigh, 
And for sweethearts try all they can do, 
But they get further off, the inure they try, 
To IIlaiittqC another's Canoe.. 
Now that's. not the- way I 
paddle through life, 
Though of young men I 
have seen a 
few, 
But I 
never met one fit to make me a 
wife, 
Or to manage for me my canoe. 
C11011.CS. 
But where there's a 
will there is always a 
way, 
A right and a 
wrong way, that's true, 
But I 
find it hest and the fairest play, 
To manage your own canoe. 
But the yonng men now assume such Tice? shapes, 
Always bringing up some fashions new, 
But instead of smart fellows they look like dull apes', 
That can't manage a 
trim canoe. 
With a 
short bobstaird coat, to taste mere pretence, 
And a 
small childish hat cocked askew, 
But the hat's big enough to hold all their sense, 
But they can't manage a 
trim canoe. 
Bat where there's a 
will, & c. 
Then their ways and- 
means are mostly mean ways. 
Hunting up sensations new, 
But these fast young men turn nights into days, 
Yet they can't manage a 
trim canoe. 
And in their amusements are not over nice, 
At morality scoffing and scorning, 
Drinking and smoking, with cards, billiards and dice, 
Going home with the milk in the morning. 
But where there's a- will, &c_ 
Present persons excepted is alwava my rule, 
So I 
don't mean, gents, a y 
of von, 
You are all first-clasa, of th e gentleman school, 
And can all manage a 
trim canoe,. 
And I 
shamld not fear to give up my heart 
To a 
real gent that's consistent ; mad true, 
But I 
am not the horse that lotus after the cart—

But where there s

TCIT, THE COBBLE:R. 
Kit, the cobbler, had built him a 
kali, 
By the side of the Barley Mow, 
And he leaves his shoes to run after the news, 
It's the way of the trade, I 
trow, 
There he'll sit in the tap, with the jug in his lap, 
And he gives as his reason why, 
That he's forced to get to a 
tap that's wet, 
When the tap of his own gets dry. 
And tap, tap, on the stone in his lap, 
For an hour or so in cold weather, 
— You may catch Mtn at work, with nose rrnd knees like a 
Turik„ 
Singing, " Oh, there's nothing like leather." 
The clerk and he they never agree, 
For Kit at the parson mocks, 
And the cause of his wrath is that one of his cloth, 
Once put Master Kit in the stocks. 
For Tory or Whig he don't care a 
fig, 
The one is bad as the other, 
A 
fifty- dollar note he will have for his vote. 
He wouldn't take Irss from his brother. 
So rap, rap, clown with it slap, 
A man should stick to his tether, 
If I 
was rich, oh, I'd not do a 
stitch, 
But sing, Oh, there's nothing like leather. 
Rit has a 
wife as 'keen as his knife, 
Arid as sharp as a 
bristle too, 
And folks do say she will have her way, 
As wives now and then will do. 
At night she'll wait at the little front gate, 
Till she heart' him lift the latch, 
Then out she'll fly, and Kit slips by, 
For he knows what he's like to catch. 
But whack I 
whack I 
down it comes on its back, 
And that not as light as a 
feather, 
For he rubs and swears, as he tumbles upstairs, 
Confound it, there's nothing like leather.!"

He walks Broadway

He took TOO Out to P-ospect Park,

Two-forty to the mile.

In the meantime, 
you must not forget 
He is such, etc. 
The kisses rained down thick and fast, 
I 
thought he'd ne'er get through, 
Of course he had to rest at last, 
But said he, " I 
love yon." 
You can't imagine bow I 
felt 
When he popped the question square, 
I 
felt as thoo ,, ii I'd like to melt 
Into the thinest air. 
Spoken—Yes, we are tt be married next week, and I would be 
pleased to see all hero again at that time, and then you can judge for 
yourself whether or no— 
He is such, etc.

And nothing ever could surpass 
Ills charming, easy gait.

And makes hint look the man, 
And cane which he knows how to swing,

WAITING FOR THE MAY. 
Ah ! my heart 1- weary, waiting, 
Waiting for the May; 
Waiting for the pleasant rambles, 
Where the fragrant hawthorn bramblee, 
With the woodbine alternating, 
Scent the dewy way. 
Ali! my heart is sore with sighing, 
Sighing for the May ; 
Sighing for the sure returning, 
When the summer beams are burning 
Hopes and flowers that, dead or dying-, 
All the winter / ay. 
Ah ! my heart, my heart is throbbing, 
Throbbing for the May; 
Throbbing for the sea-side billows, 
Or the water- wooing willows, 
Where, in laughter and in subbing, 
Glide the streams away. 
LOVE'S TRIUMPHS. 
Though glory loudly strikes my ear, 
The softer notes of love prevailing, 
Every sense assailing, 
Or swell with hope or sink with fear, 
My heart that points to fame, 
Shall rise to love as honor true, 
And fan the double flame. 
With sighs which breathe a 
last adieu. 
I 
go, my faith and love to prove, 
Valor ne'er was foe to love, 
Tho' bravest hearts obey the call, 
Love's triumphant over all,

ROLLICKING GAL. 
Good evening, friends, how do you do, 
rye come to sing a 
song. 
The subject you will soon perceive, 
As I 
sing right alone. 
It's about myself ' us plainly seen, 
My name is only Sal. 
So lively am I 
all the time, 
I'm called the Rollicking Gal. 
CTIORUS. 
Rollicking Sal is a 
Rollicking Gal, 
Rollicking Sal is a 
Rollicking Gal, 
Full of fun and nonsense too, 
Is this Rollicking Gal. 
I'm a 
coquette too, ' tis my delight, 
Young men will break their hearts 
For me ; but I 
am ever shy 
Of Cupid .s 
loving darts. 
They sigh and moan on bended knee, 
Oh 1 
love rue dearest Sal, 
But I 
say no ; ant off in a 
flash, 
For I'm a 
Rollicking Gal. 
Rollicking Sal, &c. 
I'll have to stop sometime, I 
know, 
My wild and foolish way, 
As age will creep npon us all 
I 
cannot then be gay. 
I 
would then like to settle down, 
Who'll have me ? Romping Sal. 
Will you ? will you ? I 
know you will, 
For I'm a 
Rollicking Gal. 
Rollicking Sal, crtc. 
Now, good night, friends, I'll have to go, 
conic another time, 
To try and please you, best I 
can, 
With my poor, simple rhyme. 
So good bye all, don't take offence, 
At me, your lively Sal, 
For here I o, good lock to all, 
Is the wish of the Rollicking Gal. 
Rollicking Sal, ctte. 
NATILDA TOOOTS. 
One frosty day, on pleasure bent, I 
strolled into the park, 
With skates in hand, upon the ice to have a skating lark, 
Some were whirling round like tops, sonic (loran!, lik e a 
fl ash, 
Others cut their names out, too, and others cut a 
dash. 
But not alone was I 
that day, for there, in fur-topp'd hoots, 
And four rows of pearl buttons, was my own Matilda Toots. 
Oh, my own Matilda Toots, you should have seen her boots 
Upon the ice they looked so nice, did the boots of 'Tilda Toots. 
CHORUS. 
Oh ! Matilda Toots, you should have seen her boots ! 
Upon the ice they look'd so nice, did the boots of 'Tilda Toots 
She had the prettiest pair of skates, of highly-polished steel, 
And gracefully in chair she sat, wItile I 
prepared to kneel 
Down at her feet to put them on, by boring in the soles 
Of those fur-topp'd pearl-button'd boots the smallest gimlet holes; 
But just as I 
upon my knee had got one of her boots, 
A skater from behind upset me, chair, and ' Tilda Toots 
! 
Matilda Toots, you should, tie. 
As 1, the chair, and 'Tilda Toots were struggling in a 
heap, 
A dozen skaters, more or less, came o'er us with a 
sweep, 
Some went tumbling head o'er heels, others on the back, 
When suddenly where 'Tibia lay, the ice began to crack, 
The water next came bubbling up ! crash I I 
saw the boots 
Alone above the -tvaters where had gone <bull "filda Toots. 
Oh I 
Matilda Toots, you should, dic. 
"'Scope ladders, grappling hooks, help help!" I 
roared with all 
my might 
A squad of gallant " Park Guides" then quickly hove in sight. 
They ran a 
ladder across the hole, the men aside I 
cast, 
I 
scarcely think I 
touched a 
rail. I 
rusli'd along so fast, 
But I 
was there in dine to save the soul of my pursuits 
For by those boots, those fur-topp'd boots, I 
dragged out 'Tilda 
Toots. 
Oh ! Matilda Toots, you should, tic. 
With 'Tibia in my arms to the Refreshment 'House I 
flew— 
They used tue proper remedies, and quickly brought her to. 
I 
called a 
c 
ib and saw her home—and saving thus her life, 
Matilda Toots agreed next day to he : ny darling wife, 
And as the -water did not sp)il those furtopp'd button'd boots. 
Why, in those boots— identical boots— I 
nut rried 4Matilda Toots, 
Oh I

WHEN I WENT OUT SKATING.. 
One day I 
took it in my head to go and have a 
spree; 
So off to Central Park I 
starts, to see what I 
could see ; 
I 
took ray skates into my hand, and muffled up so nice I 
So I 
resolved to try my skill of skating on the ice. 
CHORUS. 
So I 
started off to have a 
little spree, 
But I'll tell you all, white folks, what happened to me. 
So I 
just like a 
gallus sport, strapped on my skates so neat; 
Then, to be smart, of course, I 
thought I'd stand upon my feet. 
My heels went up, my head went down, just like a 
dancing-jack; 
I 
soon found out I 
was smart enough to lay upon my back. 
So I 
started off to have a 
little spree, &c. 
I 
scrambled up as best I 
could, and thought I'd try again 
To be a 
brick and strike out bold, but my luck was all the same 
For, soon I 
slipped, sad to relate, the ice was very thin , 
It quickly broke, and in I 
poked, right chuck up to my chin. 
So I 
started off to have a 
little spree, (kc. 
I 
scrambled out the best I 
could, with cold I 
soon was shaking ; 
So I 
resolved no more to try the manly art of skating; 
Now if you don't know how to skate, to learn you surely ough ter ; 
Take my advice, before it's late, and don't go near the water. 
So I 
started off to have a 
little spree, etc.

White folks, 1 
conic to tell you 
Of the days that's past and gone, 
how my daddy ussd to do 
When he was young and strong; 
How, when the work was over, 
For the banjo I 
was sent, 
Upon the old cabin floor, 
This way my daddy went. 
And when the dance was over, 
And the figs got settled down, 
Sal the good th ngs would bring out, 
And make me pass them round, 
And dad brought out the corn juice— 
On a 
good time they were bent— 
And when be once got warmed up 
This way my daddy went. 
Those days have passed away; 
Dad's no longer young and strong— 
When he hears the banjo play 
Thinks of the days that's gone. 
He tells the nig-, to listen to 
The happy hours he's spent; 
And, when he sees me dancing, says: 
This way my daddy went.

THE ROARING BOYS! 
Words by E LTON. 
Music by A.LFIIED LEE. 
Of jay dogs and noisy swells, 
You've all heard tell before, 
But I 
represent a 
noble set., 
We've come out with a 
roar. 
We're known as a 
set of roaring boys, 
And if you fun would see, 
Or revel in life's truest joys, 
You must come out with me 
Drink, boys, drink, while here you are, 
And altogether laugh, ha 
For those who wish to taste life's joys, 
Must join our school of roaring boys I 
When we go out we all mean fun, 
And come whate'er there may 
'We stand together every one, 
And always gain the day. 
The police avoid us when they can, 
And hide up in some door ; 
For with us all they find each man 
Can fight as well as roar. 
Drink, b 
ys, drink, etc. 
We ne'er play jokes on people old 
Or tricks on lame or blind ; 
For in such cowardice so cold, 
No pleasure can we find. 
The ladies, too, we will protect, 
And fr them stake our lives, 
For be who'd show them disrespect, 
All roaring boys despise. 
Drink, boys, drink, etc. 
THE RAILWAY GUARD. 
At the terminus at. Euston, of the .North Western Rail, 
A buxom wench, fair, fat, and forty was seated in the Mail, 
sh e showe d 
her ticket to me, and asked if she was rie-ht ; 
I 
told her ' yes," and loped she'd pass a 
very pleasant night. 
I 
shut the door, my whistle blew, the engine gave a 
scream ; 
We slowly left the platform, proHled along by steam ; 
Into my break I 
quickly junped, " all right I '' the word was 
And atgt
it
y::anitling pace along the Euston Line was driven. 
CHORUS-. 
In the Mail-train to the North, let it rain, hail, or snow. 
Alom; the iron railway, like lightning on we go; 
I 
care not 1r the weather ., 
and my break id not discard ; 
For, as happy as a 
king am 1, tattle' a 
Railway- Guard. 
We stopped at Rugby, when the lady called me to her side, 
She said she'd been insulted by a 
gentleman 
Who had never ceased annoying her, she was hi such a 
fright, 
And begged that I 
would quickly take the ruffian from her 
sight. 
I 
said, " Oh yes, hut first tell me the crime he has committed.' 
" 
ConunittefI " echoed she, so fierce, I 
thought she was half-
witted ; 
Go fetch me it policeman, and as sure as eggs is eggs, 
I 
will give him into custody for tickling of my lees. 
In the Mail-train to the North, etc. 
The gentle he said, 'twas false, the wo man most 
be ma d, 
Or would not charge him ‘vrongiully, it really was too bad, 
lie had not once been near her, her story was untrue ; 
H e kept apart., for " distance lent enchantment to the view." 
Into the carriage I 
immediately did go, 
To try and find the culprit who had tensed the lady so. 
Whet) underneath the seat where she sat, how very a °eking- ! 
Was a basket of game fowls that had been pecking at her 
stocking. 
In the Mail-train to the North, etc. 
An apology she quickly made to him ere he departed ; 
And grieved to think that she had been so very chicken hearted. 
The gentleman accepted it, and loudly laughed outright, 
And advised her to " put " gaiters" on if there she stayed that 
A warning this to vonne• men be, the danger here is shown, 
Of riding in a 
train at night., with a 
female all alone. 
Look out for baskets ' neat Ii the seat, before you start away, 
Or you perhaps, may be acco-ed one day, of some foul play. 
In the Mail-train to the North, etc.

I REALLY THINK SHE DID, 
SHE DID. 
Itrusiz published by F. VAN lliss, 320 Eth Avenue, N. Y. 
I 
courted once a 
nice young girl; 
I'll tell you if I 
can, 
The whole affair as it occurred, 
Between me and Mary Ann. 
She was a 
blooming girl, 
As charming as could be. 
And these the words she always said, 
That she loved no one like me. Now, 
cnout -s. 
Do you realy think she did, she did, 
Do you really think she did ; 
Oh, tell me, if you'll he so kind, 
Do you really think she did. 
I 
used to take my Mary Ann, 
To every ball and rout; 
In fact I 
spent all th' stamps I 
had, 
In lugging her about. 
She was very foal of oysters, 
She'd eat until she was blue • 
But she said, " it's not the fish I 
like, 
My love, it's only you." Now, 
Do you really think it was, it was, etc. 
This charming girl told me, 
On a 
sick friend she would call ; 
So I 
thought I'd have a 
jolly spree, 
So I 
started for the ball. • 
The first I 
saw was Ataxy Ann. 
Upon a 
young man's knee ; 
And. when I 
asked her what she meant, 
She said she thought it was me. 
Do you really think she did, she did, etc. 
Spoken— At last, with much persuasion, some days after the ball, I 
managed to marry the girl. 
Every thing went lovely as could be for 
a 
few months, but— 
I 
went home rather soon one night, 
And such a 
sight was seen! 
There sat my wife with her arms around 
The neci: of a 
Horse Marine. 
Said I 
to her, " I 
won't stand that, 
Your conduct is not right." 
Said she, " Now John, don't he a 
fool. 
it's my cousin, Sergeant White." 
Do you really think it was, it was, etc. 
One morning off she bolted, 
I 
shall never forget the day, 
For she sold every stick I 
had, 
And lett me the bills to pay. 
In a 
note she left behind her, 
She said it was all serene, 
That she couldn't live with such a 
flat, 
For I 
was so wry green. 
Do you really thiA I 
was, I 
was, etc. 
THE NIGHT WHEN FIRST WE DIET, 
Ant.—" W reath of Roses." 
She ate six score oysters, 
The night when first we met, 
With pickled eels and lush, 
Besides a 
lut of heavy wet. 
Her body had no lightness, 
She weighed full forty stone, 
The token of the lots of grub 
With which she had been blown 
I 
saw her but a 
moment, 
I 
think I 
see her now, 
At a 
flash bar in the city, 
With her hair all on her brow. 
Six plates of meat and potatoes 
She ate when next we met, 
The expression she made use of 
I 
never shall forget; 
And standing by her side was one 
Who 
strove, though all in vain, 
To get the money for the grub 
He neer would see again. 
I 
saw her but a 
moment, 
I 
think I 
see her now, 
Being lugg,'d off by two policemen 
Knocking up a 
jolly row. 
When next again I 
saw that lass, 
No ringlets then were there, 
For she had had the prison crop 
And a 
month to grind the air. 
She passed her time right gaily, 
And once more she is free, 
She's been and joined the temperance, 
And 111PRIIS to live on tea. 
I 
saw her but a 
moment, 
Methinks I 
see her now, 
Standing on a 
chair and preaching 
With a 
false front on her brow.

DON'T CATCH A BUTTERFLY.

But littl e boys g

used to try, 
As quick as any merry lark,

Oh I 
now boys and girls beware 
And learn to mind your eye, 
While you are well enough

set up for a

And tbo't it nice to take a

"To bet my money on the bobtailed nag," 
But " Mountain Girl" was quicker en the fly; 
So I 
told my " Ma" just now I 
had been hurt, 
Said she to me " my son, oh mind your eye 
Just (-bevy time you wil resort 
To bet your money like a 
sport, 
You're after a 
butterfly," 
Oh I 
now boys, ctc. 
Then I 
did resolve to try and be a 
man— 
A girl she shot an arrow in my eye; 
My heart went pi- ti-pi- ti-pat and so 
I 
feared, oh, dear ! I as a 
butterfly ! 
"ilb-etly Mollie Jane," said I, " oh be my Queen !" 
Said she, " I 
will be yours, untill I 
die."— 
'Twas tvalking out upon the green, 
When nothing but the stars were seen, 
I 
cau,.;ht not a 
butterfly.

WHAT OTHER NAME THAN THINE, MOTHER. 
What other name than thine, mother, 
What other name than thine, 
Can bring to hearts bowed down, mother, 
A balm so like divine? 
CII OR 
US. 
'Tis like a 
beam of light, mother, 
Our darksotne way to cheer, 
Dispelling eilown of night, mother, 
And bringing gladness here. 
What other voice than thine, mother, 
What other voice than thine, 
Can waft a 
magic spell. mother, 
O'er sorrow's tearful shrine ? 
'Tis like a 
beam of light, a:e. 
Thou'rt with us yet ; but oh I 
mother, 
flow long ere setting sun, 
Shall shroud in gloom and night, mother, 
A day so bright at noon? 
CHORUS. 
At morning when we kneel, mother, 
A. ,, cends an earnest plea; 
At evening's holy cal a. mother, 
A prayer ascends f'or thee. 
Dost think that we neglect. mother, 
To prize thy dearest name ? 
Thou knowest not how warm, moth. r, 
Is fire without, a 
flame.

At morning when we kneel, •atc.. 
I WANDERED BY THE RIVER. 
I 
wandered by the river, 
It still flows on the same 
As when, in early childhood, 
I 
learnt to know its name. 
Its soft and plaintive murmurs 
Still sound most sweet to me, 
As through the broad, green valley 
It flows down to the sea. 
The little round white pebbles 
Still near the brink are laid, 
The tall trees spread their branches 
In mingled light and shade. 
Like some forgotten music, 
Its voice comes back to me, 
As through the broad, green valley, 
It runs clown to the sea. 
I 
wandered by the river, 
And happy was the day, 
I 
spent in gathering pebbles, 
Beneath the sun's bright ray. 
And now, though all se-ems altered, 
The change is but in me, 
My young life floweth onward, 
As the river to the sea. 
S. 
SUCH A HAPPY PAIR. 
Oh, Sally Snipps she was a 
gal, Joe Simmons was a 
chap, 
They loved each other dearly from the time they first eat pap, 
And often in one gutter, they'd together sit and play, 
And share their bread apd butter, a 
happy couple they. 
0 
dear, oh, they were such a 
happy pair, 
The way they loved each other, it was beyond compare. 
Oh, dear, oh, such a 
happy pair, 
Joseph's locks were carrotty, and Sal's was auburn hair. 
Now her mother was a 
woman, her father was a 
man. 
They tried to thwart this loving pair, so straightway they began 
To make young Joe a 
soldier, whilst poor Sal quite forsook, 
They sent her away to Pimlico in service there as cook. 
Oh, dear, oh, they were, tkc. 
Now the nurse there was a 
female, and the footman was a 
male, 
They used to flirt whilst Sal w,tuld her poor Joe bewail, 
Till at last there came a 
paceman who oft with Sal would stay 
But from her mind the thoughts of Joe she could not drive away. 
Oh, dear, oh, they were, dx. 
You see the policeman's clothes were blue, the soldiers they 
were red, 
And one night as the bobby in Sally's kitchen fed. 
lle, red witti clothes and pission, appeared unto the two. 
And the bobby, like his uniform, did look uncommon blue. 
Oh, dear, oh, they were, Sze. 
Oh, dear, the policeman's staff was wood, Joe's bayonet was 
steel, 
And the bobby never lived to see the finish of his meal, 
The bayonet pierced the bobby's breast, the staff broke Joseph's 
head, 
And Sal, of course she broke her heart, to see her Joseph dead. 
Oh, dear, oh, they were. & c. 
I 
see ray song has made you laugh, it should have made you 
cry, 
Because it isn't pleasant from steel or wood to die, 
bull I 
would steal your kind applause, that is if you think it 
fair, 
For telling you of Joe and Sal, that very happy pair. 
Oh, dear, oh, they were, & c.
