BLUE RIDGE QUILTS—Plain and Fancy 
I. Introduction 
Toward the end of my stay in the Blue Ridge as a part of the 
American Folklife Center's research team, I interviewed Zenna Todd, a 
traditional quilter from Ennis, North Carolina. During the course of 
our conversation, she told me the following narrative and later alluded 
to parts of it several times, an indication of its importance in her 
repertoire of narratives: 
I'll never forget the first quilt that I cut out by pattern; 
it was a Monkey Wrench. My mother-in-law, she was going to 
show me how to quilt, you know, and how to do it. So she 
helped me to get started. The lining was kind of a deep 
rose color, and I said to her, I said, what kind of thread 
should we use to quilt this with. Oh I was really tickled to 
get started, you know, on that quilt, and she says, well. I'd 
just use black. Said you've got an awful lot of dark colors 
in it. So we hanged the quilt from the ceiling with cord, 
and put it in a frame, and she helped me to get started. She 
didn't tell me to pull the knots through the lining and have 
them on the inside so they wouldn't show. She says, well 
now you just go ahead and quilt all the way across there, and 
I'll be back tomorrow and see how you're doing. So I quilted 
all the way across one side. She didn't tell me about the 
knots, and where I'd tied those knots and I hadn't pulled 
them through, and there they showed, just them black knots 
on the underneath side. So when I rolled the quilt up, I 
rolled it up so we could walk under it and around it, and I 
looked up under it, and it looked like flies a-setting on 
the quilt. I said when she come back, I said, my goodness, 
I've just ruined this quilt. I said, I've got, it looks 
like flies a-setting on the lining. She says, my goodness, 
says, why didn't you pull them through. And I says, why, you 
didn't tell me.

Mrs. Todd's narrative is both amusing and instructive to a local audience; 
in addition, it makes several important points about Blue Ridge quilting. 
First, this woman, like so many others in the region, learned how to quilt 
from her mother-in-law after she was married. She did not set up house¬ 
keeping with the proverbial dozen quilts or an elaborately stitched bridal 
quilt.1 Second, the quilting process itself was, and still is, a solitary 
affair performed in the home with quilting frames suspended from the ceiling. 
Quilting bees are relatively modern devices used primarily for fund-raising 
by local groups. Finally the quilts were pieced in traditional block 
patterns and quilted with thread of a contrasting color. Elaborate patterns 
radiating from the center are uncommon, and thread colors were seldom chosen 
to blend in with the color of the quilt top or lining. 
These observations contradict some common notions about quilting, 
and at the same time reinforce the importance of continuing serious inves¬ 
tigations into regional quilting styles. Although many scholars believe 
that this particular area of women's studies has been examined in micro¬ 
scopic detail, we have done very little to examine the entire range of 
quilts created in any given region. We have poked at quilt tops until they 
are ragged, documented quilting bees ad infinitum, and more recently, 
2 
investigated ethnic sources of quilting styles. One reason for this 
narrowed vision seems to be our scholarly preoccupation with the Pennsylvania- 
German quilting model; individual quilters or comnunities of quilters that 
do not fit the stereotype are routinely ignored. We need to begin to 
examine the entire scope of a woman's handwork and produce more descriptive 
essays dealing with regional quilt types and quilting techniques. Finally 
we also should document the quilter's words and narratives to better under¬ 
stand the history, vision, and spirit of women who create such intriguing 
iterns.^ 
3 
Peering more closely at specific regions gives us an opportunity to 
look more closely at the impact of specific socio-economic forces. The 
quilting revival, for example, has now had a significant effect on tradi¬ 
tional quilting techniques. Quilting books, magazines, and newsletters 
clutter our libraries and newsstands. No corner of our vast country is 
safe from tourism, and federal programs occasionally reach those for whom 
they are intended. All these influences should be considered particularly 
when we look at any potentially marketable craft. 
But, at the same time, we must remember that some privacy remains 
in American life. Comercial ventures, the media, and the federal govern¬ 
ment often fail to impinge upon the everyday lives of the resilient folk. 
One researcher said that it would be "difficult for fieldworkers to find 
craftspeople not influenced by the 'revival' and its educational institu- 
4 
tions." Such is not the case. Many traditional craftsmen carry out their 
work unfettered and uninterrupted by scholars, book salesmen, craft shop 
owners, social workers, and probably even field researchers for the Library 
of Congress. 
Occasionally we did intrude, however, and the observations made 
in this paper are based on tape recorded interviews with sixteen Blue 
Ridge quiIters and informal discussions with many other quiIters, craft 
shop owners, and residents of our eight county area. I located infor¬ 
mants by visiting craft shops, talking to County Extension Agents, and 
simply driving around the countryside. Sixteen hundred photographs, 
primarily of quilts, provide the visual documentation for this essay, 
and 102 pages of field notes add some contextual background to these 
mechanical images. 
In searching for Blue Ridge quilts and quiIters, I looked for some 
pattern in the visual and verbal images that bombarded me each day. 
4 
Was it geographical? Did North Carolina quilts and quiltmaking tech¬ 
niques differ from Virginia's? Did quilts "up the mountain" vary from 
their counterparts "down the mountain?" No such simple answer emerged. 
Instead of a pattern of geographical variation, I found a somewhat 
blurry pattern of socio-economic differences. Women living within one 
or two miles of one another created items that reflected their unique 
lifestyles, purposes, values, and finally individual styles. I chose 
to call these two types of quilts the plain and the fancy. 
In using these two terms, I am not simply referring to the surface 
appearance of the quilt as most folk art historians do. Rather I am 
speaking of the cluster of conceptual and behavioral processes shared 
by the women who make each type of quilt. I am focusing on the fabrics 
used in the quilt top and the techniques used to piece or applique it; 
the filler or lining the quiIters use; the quilting thread and the 
stitches they make; the way the quilt is bound; and finally the use to 
which the quilt is put. Plain quilters share a common set of values 
in these and other matters as do their fancy counterparts. 
Plain quilting, with its roots firmly planted in tradition, was 
born of necessity and nurtured by both white and black cultural tradi¬ 
tions in the area. As one woman explains, "Just so we had quilts for 
our own use. That's all we thought about in them days. That's how 
people kept warm then, you know. They didn't keep their houses warm all 
night like they do now. We depended on those quilts to keep warm." 
To a lesser degree, fancy quilting also existed in the Blue Ridge, but 
the tradition has been strongly influenced by the quilting revival and 
a host of outside forces, especially federal and state poverty programs, 
tourism, and national publications. 
5 
Several words of caution are necessary here. First, the words 
"fancy" and "plain" come from the quiIters themselves. Fancy quilting 
is a label promoted by quilting books and newsletters, but the women 
of the region also call themselves and others "fancy quilters."® Zenna 
Todd, for example, tried to describe a fancy quilt to me that same 
afternoon: 
A fancy quilt I would call one that was pieced by a pattern 
and quilted around each piece on each side of a seam and then 
if it was put together with say one piece block and then a 
solid block. Then do some kind of real pretty design in 
the solid block. Then you do the border then to correspond with 
the quilting you did in the solid. Now that's what I would call 
a fancy. 
Then she went on to discuss the plain quilt. "The other kind," she 
said, "would be just something that you would need to keep the bed 
warm." The term, "plain," then is used less often by the quilters to 
refer to women who make primarily utilitarian quilts. 
Second, there is considerable cross-over between the two categories. 
Most fancy quilters began as plain quilters; some women now make both 
types--the plain to use at home and the fancy to sell. "If I make a 
fancy one, I sell it," Ruth Holbrook of Traphill, North Carolina says. 
Then she describes how she makes the rag quilts as she calls them: 
The ones that I use at the house, there's not much work in 
them. I stick them on the sewing machine and sew them up, 
and then quilt them with stitches about a quarter or eighths 
long,so they'll hold together and throw them on the bed and 
go on. 
Finally, little communication takes place between the two groups, and 
there seems to be little familiarity with the types of quilts made by a 
neighbor who participates in a different quilting network. 
6 
II. Plain Quilts 
Twelve out of sixteen quiIters I interviewed could be called 
plain quilters. Sociologists would probably place most at the lower end 
of the Blue Ridge socio-economic scale, and because of this, the women 
share a similar world view and set of domestic values. The quilts they 
make display certain common characteristics that readily reflect the 
unique vision of their creators. They are born of necessity and meant 
to be used when people "got good and cold;" because of this they are made 
quickly from bits and pieces of dark fabrics generally found in today's 
clothing. In working with very limited resources, these quilters show 
as much ingenuity as their needle-wielding ancestors did. They stitch 
block patterns almost exclusively with the LeMoyne Star a favorite 
motif. The blocks are then stitched into strips and later into stan¬ 
dard sized quilts. In terms of quilting process, then, the greatest 
continuity of tradition is found in the plain quilt. 
In function, the plain quilt was, and still is, made because it 
is needed as a bedcover. Blue Ridge winters are cold, and those 
interesting vernacular houses are drafty and cold. Rug weaver Mazie 
Beamer describes her large I shaped house for me: 
It was just a frame house. There was no insulation. They 
didn't storm side houses then; they just put up their weather 
boarding, and then they sealed with beaded sealing inside, 
and there was no way . . . When the wind blowed and the snow 
come, it snowed in the house too. I know when you get up of 
a morning, you'd have to get upstairs to the attic and scoop 
up, sometimes the snow would be six inches deep up there, 
and you gotta get that out before you got the house warm 
enough for it to melt and run down through. So you always 
had to move around when it was that kind of weather. 
7 
Obviously, she continues, "When you lived in a cold, cold house, you 
had to have a lot of quilts to keep you warm." Roxie Ray's father 
slept with anywhere from five to seven quilts on his bed, and another 
woman claims, "We couldn't turn over," at night because the quilts 
were so heavy. Although most Blue Ridge homes are warmer today than 
they once were, these quiIters still cling to their old habits making 
quilts from heavy materials, filling them with thick batting or blankets, 
and creating an item that weighs heavily on the body at night. 
The plain quilt represents a salvage craft at its very best. 
Tops are pieced with any kind of material found around the house and 
farm--feedsacks, old clothing, and scraps from homemade clothing. 
"Whatever you had you had to use it," said Roxie Ray, a 
quiIter from Poplar Springs, North Carolina. "You had to figure out 
some way to use it because people didn't have the money, and my folks 
wasn't the only ones that didn't have it. It just wasn't there." 
Her ingenious family made strip quilts from old sandpaper belts re¬ 
trieved by her father from the furniture factory in nearby Elkin: 
It was sandbelts that run the sander at the furniture factory 
where my Daddy worked. When the sand was wore off them, they'd 
take them off and put a new one on. They'd reach across this 
room and more. One of these long belts, you know, that run 
those wheels, and they'd just throw them away. Well, my father 
got to bringing them home, and he found you could put them in 
a tub of water and soak them, and all that sand would come off. 
Then mother would take them and boil them, and they'd be white, 
and then she'd dye them pink, or green, and make strip quilts 
out of it like that. And the lining, top, and back. And she 
would tack them though. 
8 
Later some quiIters could afford to buy special fabrics for their 
quilts, and as Zenna Todd points out, their quilting improved: 
I didn't do the fancy thing about quilting, like cutting out 
by patterns. At that time we didn't have too much to do with, 
and we would just sew them up every how the pieces come, you 
know. Call it crazy quilt. But then as the years advanced, 
we got on up where we could buy a little better material 
and cut out by patterns and pieced. 
But most plain quilters still use scraps from sewing and old clothing 
given to them by family and friends. If they buy fabrics they still 
cling to those standards of the past. White, for example, 
is not a popular color in these quilts. "Most of the time, we tried to 
make the quilts dark regardless of the pattern," Roxie Ray recalls, 
"and we tried to get dark outing. Gray outing they called it, to make 
the linings out of." White is seldom found in quilts meant to be 
used, but instead the brightly colored solids, large prints, and plaids 
of everyday clothing predominate. Finally, because so many fabrics 
used in sewing today are man-made, plain quilts are often created from 
both woven and double-knit polyester. 
These quilts are frequently filled with homemade cotton 
batting, blankets from the local Chatham Blanket Factory, old 
clothing, and less often, store bought Mountain Mist filler. Zenna 
Todd recalls that her mother-in-law used to make her own warm wool 
batting: 
She would buy this wool when people would shear their sheeps. 
She would go and get this wool and wash it, and then she had 
cards, what she called cards. I had never seen any until after 
I was married. She would card this wool, and it would be about 
a three by six inch little bats. She'd lay them in a box; when 
she got ready to fix her quilts, she'd get them out and put them 
on there. Oh it just made one of the wonderfulest quilts you've 
9 
ever seen. It would be so soft and so warm. That real sheep 
wool. But it was a lot of work in it, but you know, people 
had more time than they had money at that time. 
Wool seldom appears as a filler in today's quilts except in the form of 
new blankets or worn-out clothing. When old clothes are used as filler, 
the seams are ripped apart, the worn parts cut out, and the pieces 
simply laid on the lining or basted together to form one piece. 
The linings and joinings, on the other hand, are often made from 
feed sacks, either dyed or not, old sheets, or curtains. Again, Roxie 
Ray remembers the fabrics used to line the quilt and to set or join 
the blocks in the top: 
We used to buy our linings out of feed sacks or get domestic 
and dye them. Plain old factory cloth. We'd dye it with dif¬ 
ferent colors, and sew a seam and that would just be seventy- 
two inches wide. It was only thirty-six inches. And then 
two and a half for the lining. But everybody back in my days, 
they couldn't buy stuff to set them together with, so we used 
whatever we had. Costed too much especially where there's a 
big bunch of kids to sew for. They had scraps, they called them, 
and they used that. 
Two quilters told me they pieced together small smoking tobacco sacks 
to make a quilt lining. They split the unbleached muslin sacks, washed 
them, and stitched them together to make a perfectly suitable lining. 
Some Blue Ridge women collected the thread to piece the quilts 
and sometimes quilt them by unravelling worn-out socks or feed sacks, 
winding the thread on a spool, and using it later in the quilt. Maggie 
Schockley of Hillsville, Virginia, still uses the thread her mother 
unravelled from socks or later collected from factories: 
She would ravel old stockings, and I have seen her tak,e you 
know, material was pretty good at that time, and she would 
pull the ravel!ings off the edge of the material, and double 
10 
it together and use it to quilt. The tops of socks was 
always made out of just a little bit better material than 
the other cotton, and she saved all the little sock tops 
and ravelled that off and made the balls. Then later in 
years, in the past 20 years, I guess, there would be differ¬ 
ent people, who worked at factories where they used threads, 
and the little dabs of thread that was left on the cones, 
they would bring it to her, and I have balls of this thread 
now that she has wound up and that I do my piecing with. 
Tacking a quilt demanded even more ingenuity. "We didn't have nothing," 
Roxie Ray says, "only just those . . . thrums from the mill we tacked 
with, or a nickle ball of tobacco twine." 
The fan, frequently highlighted by using a thread of a contrasting 
color, was by far the most popular quilting pattern for these women. 
Elizabeth Smith of Mount Airy, North Carolina, used to buy her mother's 
number eight quilting thread, and her choice of color depended upon the 
shades in the quilt top. "If it was a real light color, she'd use 
dark thread, and if it was a dark color, she'd use the white thread. 
So it would show, her design would." Apparently the stitches were 
meant to be visible in direct contradiction to those values usually 
associated with Pennsylvania-German quilting traditions. 
Fan quilting represents most clearly the tensions between old 
and new, plain and fancy quilting in the Blue Ridge. Used almost 
universally in older regional quilts, this pattern may well reflect the 
Anglo heritage of the region. A similar pattern, called sea wave, 
was "popular among Welsh workers," and the fan itself seems to be found 
everywhere except in those regions dominated by Pennsylvania-German 
quilting traditions.7 Ruth Holbrook calls it the "easiest and the 
oldest quilting pattern." Another quilter claims that she does "mostly 
what the old folks call the fan pattern and put about four lines in 
11 
the fan." Finally it may be that sense of heritage that keeps the 
quilting pattern alive, for even fancy quilter Crystal Cruise uses it 
in about forty percent of her quilts. She remembers her mother laying 
off the fans with chalk: 
That's how I learned to lay off was by watching my mother 
lay off with the chalk and the cord. Laying off the fans, 
I remember so well watching her as a child even. That's 
how she did her quilting. I never saw her quilt a quilt 
other than by fans, and she did a lot of them. 
The semi-circular lines both hold the filler tightly and follow the 
natural movement of the arm as it moves across the quilt top making the 
pattern easy to quilt. Roxie Ray believes she is anatomically suited 
to fan quilting: 
Now quilting is right down my alley. That's my hobby. And 
I always get the fans. I reach out the farthest of any of 
the rest cause I got the longest legs, and the longest arms, 
and the longest feet of any in the bunch. ... I am really 
long cause I'm a big person. I'm not too fat, but you'd be 
surprised how much I weigh cause I've got a body. So I reach 
out yonder, see, this is the way you reach out for a quilt, 
you know. 
Although fan quilting is still popular in the Blue Ridge, these quilters 
seldom emphasize their stitches by using a contrasting thread. Instead 
threads that match either the lining or the quilt top are chosen, and 
thus even these women are moving away from the aesthetic values of the 
past. 
Fan quilting itself may be an endangered species among both plain 
and fancy quilters in the region because it is so often ignored by 
quilting newsletters and roundly condemned by at least one craft shop 
owner along the Blue Ridge Parkway. "I was quilting for one lady," 
12 
Zenna Todd told me, "She wanted me to do some quilts for her one time 
. . . and she says, for goodness sake, don't do any in the fan. Says 
I don't like that." Thus because the most traditional and distinctive 
quilting pattern in the region is perceived as somehow inferior to the 
more fancy Germanic tastes of outsiders, it may become obsolete. 
These women also care very little about small, even quilting 
stitches. They all joke about their handwork saying they make stitches 
so big "they have to be careful they don't hang up their toenails in 
them at night." Roxie Ray even claims that "it's much better to have 
them a little bit long. They used to make those little, teeney-weeney, 
short stitches," she says, "and they'd make them so short that they'd 
punch back through" the quilt top. Large stitches, of course, made 
the quilting easier and faster, but if the women felt particularly 
rushed, they tacked these quilts using the regular tacking method or 
what one quilter calls secret or hidden tacking. "We tacked more 
quilts than we quilted." rug weaver Thelma Melton said, "because it 
was quicker and there was so much to do we didn't have time to do 
this fancy stitching and all that." Ruth Holbrook, however, refused 
to tack a quilt unless she was "covering an old quilt." Even then, 
she continues, "somebody else gets that on their bed. The tacks 
tickle my face. The string gets in my mouth." 
To finish the quilt, most plain quilters would do as Carrie 
Severt describes, either bring the quilt lining up over the top and 
stitch it down by hand, or fold the top down over the lining. She 
13 
makes her decision based on both practical and aesthetic considerations 
Sometimes I turn the lining up on the top, and sometimes 
I turn the top down on the lining. You can hem them either 
way you want to do it. It's just according to what color 
they are, and what color the lining is. If the lining 
matches the top pretty good, I put the lining up on top of 
the top. But it works both ways. 
Few would go to the additional expense or work of making a piece of 
bias tape to bind the quilt's edge. 
Everyday quilts made primarily for warmth can be divided into 
three categories. Many women choose to follow a specific pieced 
pattern, usually borrowed from a friend or neighbor, but others prefer 
the string quilt, and still others the strip quilt. 
String quilts carry several different labels in the Blue Ridge; 
they may be called block, rag, or even crazy quilts. The true string 
quilt consists of scraps of fabric stitched onto a square of old cloth 
or a piece of paper. The largest piece of fabric runs diagonally 
from corner to corner of the block, and the remaining pieces are 
stitched to it. Then, the loose ends of the strips are cut follow¬ 
ing the paper pattern, and the resulting blocks sewn together. Ila 
Patton of Gal ex recalls using pages from the Sears, Roebuck or Wards 
catalog for her paper patterns: 
We used to use old catalogs. It was paper, you know, the 
sheets out of it, it was thin, and it wasn't as rotten as 
the thicker paper would be. Take the leaves out of, well, 
we called it Roebuck catalog. Wards, we'd just tear them 
pages out, and just piece them and then sew them together. 
Black quilter Donna Choate doubts that catalogs were used by her 
neighbors; she says "Course they wouldn't hardly tear up a catalog. 
14 
They was a rarity in those days." She recalls, too, that some women 
left the paper on the square to make the quilt warmer: 
I'd hear people laughing and talking and saying, yeah, leave 
that paper, make it that much warmer. All the ladies would do 
it. Piece it on a piece of paper, and then when they got that 
square done, they laid it right on that quilt. Leave that 
paper there. Now Mama pieced on paper sometimes, but she tore 
the paper off. She never did leave the paper on the square. 
The blocks, with or without the paper, were either sewn directly to 
one another or joined with a two to three inch strip of material 
called a joining. 
Both black and white area quilters make strip and string quilts. 
One black quilter pieces strip quilts exclusively, but another had only 
one in her collection of six quilts. Among white quilters, prefer¬ 
ences are equally as mixed. Mazie Beamer says she "pieced one crazy 
quilt fashion, and it almost made me crazy." Ila Patton, however, 
prefers what she calls a crazy quilt: 
I'll tell you, I'd used to just rather piece them in little 
strips every way and every color. I liked them that way. 
I called them crazy quilts. That's the way I most always 
pieced mine. I didn't hardly cut any patterns. It took a 
lot more material when you cut a pattern, and when you piece 
them crazy, you can just use every little scrap in it. 
Frequently these quilts were tacked or quilted in the fan, and when 
fan quilting is used, the visual tension created by the rectangular 
strips and the primarily circular fans is most intriguing. Area 
quilters claim these quilt tops and quilting patterns were "easy to 
make," but the complex visual appeal, heightened by the contrasting 
15 
thread, certainly played some role as Carrie Severt notes: 
Now some you can lay it off in fans, what they call fans, 
and when you quilt that, you see, them shows up there 
pretty. And some of them where you quilt them like they're 
pieced, they don't show up as pretty as the fans does. 
Mamie Bryan, who is "just awful to make quilts," is one of two 
black quiIters I interviewed. The dozen quilts she had neatly stored 
in her bedroom clearly represent her repertoire and add further evi¬ 
dence to Vlach's theory that a separate black quilting aesthetic modi- 
O 
fied basic Anglo-American forms. Mrs. Bryan, however, also shares 
certain characteristics with her plain quilting neighbors. She 
learned how to quilt after she married to provide a warm cover for her 
family: 
ten's mother showed me how to quilt. I married when I was 
just about 15 going on 16. I was young when I married. She 
showed me how to do my work. I didn't know too much about 
quilting. I married and came in the house with her, and 
she showed me how to quilt, how to piece, and things like 
that. So I learned. Cause I needed them anyhow, so I had 
to learn. 
Later quilting became a way to ward off the loneliness of a big two 
story I house while her husband worked in the West Virginia coal mines 
or spent the evening fox hunting with his friends. "He went out fox 
hunting," she says, "and I'd sit and piece quilts while he was out 
hunting. Me and the children. I'm glad it's all over with." 
All of Mamie Bryan's quilts are block or strip, pieced "by the 
finger," and tacked or quilted in the fan. She uses no pattern," 
and just "kinda matches up my colors to make them look pretty." 
Feed sack linings, most often dyed by Mrs. Bryan, form the colorful 
16 
linings for her quilts. She used every scrap available to her in those 
days; "I had to save everything," she says, "and piece everything that 
I could get to keep us warm. Sorta hard living back yonder." She 
also used old clothing for the filler in her quilts: 
You couldn't get everything you wanted then. Everything was 
hard to get ahold of. I'd use sheets, and then sometimes if 
I'd wash our clothes and just tear out the good pieces like a 
skirt, just take the band off . . . and wash it nice and clean 
and lay it right in there. That would be for your padding. 
Mamie Bryan may tell the outsider that her quilts are "sorry stuff," 
but she also recognizes them as special items to hand down to her 
children. 
a. 
On silk quilt Mrs. Bryan thinks "moreof . . . than I do of any of 
them" is actually a counterpane completed by Mr. Bryan's mother some¬ 
time before 1958. It is appliqued in an elaborate Dutch Girl pattern 
and tufted around each square. Mrs. Bryan wanted to put the fragile 
counterpane to better use, so she bought silk pieces for one dollar 
and turned the counterpane into a string quilt: 
I kept the counterpane a long time, and I decided that I 
didn't want to use it on the bed just for a counterpane, 
and I was going to make a quilt out of it. So I just 
went and bought me some silk pieces . . . and made a silk 
top to it. It's beautiful. 
After she had stitched the silk squares together, she used white 
thread to quilt the entire piece in the fan or squared fan pattern. 
Obviously this heirloom was valuable to the Bryans; the fact 
that Mrs. Bryan actually paid money to buy fabric is a testimony to 
that fact. She also spent a considerable amount of time piecing the 
quilt; "that was the hardest one I've ever pieced in my life," she says. 
17 
"I had a job with that quilt." Thus the strip piecing and white fan 
quilting were not simply utilitarian devices for Mrs. Bryan, but 
instead clear examples of her Afro-American aesthetic values 
at work. 
Mamie Bryan also started what she labelled a Log Cabin quilt, 
but the item that emerged represents a battleground of personal 
values more clearly than most quilts. She made four or five 
Log Cabin blocks that closely resemble the patterns suggested by 
Vlach; later she said she just got tired of it because it went so 
slowly, and she created the rest of the quilt from her own improvi- 
9 
sational blocks: 
His mother had a log cabin quilt . . . and I wanted to learn 
how to make one. So I started mine, but I got tired of it. I 
got got along too slow. So I quit. But now you can tell it. 
Here's the blocks. Them's the blocks I got pieced, and I got 
tired of that log cabin. Now she called it a log cabin quilt. 
Blocks. So I got tired of that, and I says I'm going to 
piece my own to get the quilt done. So I just pieced mine 
any way I wanted. All of them's in blocks and strips. . . . 
I said well I didn't have but four blocks. I said I'll put 
it right in the middle of my quilt. I couldn't finish it. 
It was too slow. 
Did fatigue or impatience cause her to change her pattern, or did the 
improvisational blocks seem visually more appealing to her? We can 
only guess. 
Donna Choate, on the other hand, is a black quilter whose mother 
"came up with white people." Only one out of six of her quilts is a 
strip quilt; one was simply a quilted floral sheet, and two others 
were rather precise pieced patterns. "Black people had it pretty 
rough," she says, and when she visited her friends, she noticed that 
18 
"their quilts were not as good." Design or pattern is the character¬ 
istic that distinguished her family's quilts, and it is a value that 
remains with her until today: 
Well, I would think the design would be the main thing about a 
quilt. Because if you just piece up a strip just in any form, 
amount or any, it doesn't harmonize, it's not going to be very 
pretty. I'd rather piece my pieces, make squares, and put them 
together. Now a lot of people they have strip, a strip of this 
kind, a strip, they go to the store and buy remnants, you know, 
and make quilts. And they have all kind of colors. But mother 
taught us to use designs. If I was to make one now, it'd be 
some kind of design, I don't know what it would be. 
A nine patch pattern completed by Mrs. Choate several years ago, however, 
showed that same random arrangement of blocks suggestive of black improvi 
sation in quilt making.^ 
Not far from the Choate farm lives Carrie Severt, a quilter who 
uses approximately twenty to twenty-five quilts in her home. About 
one-fifth of them are strip quilts consisting of large squares and 
rectangles of dark brown, gray, blue, and black. The rest of her 
quilts include such familiar pieced patterns as Lone Star, the Tree, 
and the Wheel. Several others are similar to Mamie Bryan's quilts; 
the patterns tend to be less discernible because Pennsylvania-German 
quilting standards are not carefully heeded by Mrs. Severt. 
The Severts' handsome rented farmhouse is made even grander on 
days when Carrie Severt airs out her quilts. "If you ain't used them 
too much," she says, "airing does them as much good as washing them." 
She washes the heavy quilts only once a year, but airs them as she 
feels it is necessary. 
Carrie Severt gets her quilting patterns from neighbors, friends 
and family members, and makes her own cardboard and sandpaper templates 
19 
to use in piecing. Like most plain quiIters, she refuses to buy 
patterns or make applique quilts. Once she bought some applique 
patterns, but found the process entirely too wasteful: 
I ordered me a bunch of patterns one time out of a magazine 
some way, but I never have thought too much of them. They're 
pretty, but it takes a whole lot of stuff to fix one of the 
things. You've got to have material to sew these patterns 
down on it, and some of them it takes great big old long 
pieces to put them designs on there. 
Thus pieced patterns better suit her thrifty nature. 
Carrie Severt is an avid quiIter, and during one winter pieced 
over forty quilt tops. For her it is not simply another household 
chore, but an activity that engages her emotionally and intellectually 
But, law. I'd rather quilt than eat. I love that quilting. 
I ain't too good a hand at it, but I just dearly love it. 
My husband gets so made at me he could kill me. He said 
I'd sit here and piece them old quilts and let him starve to 
death. I told him I'd rather quilt than eat. But I never 
let him get hungry. I always fix his meals. 
During the winter, she quilts alone in her bedroom after helping her 
husband with the outdoor chores. He may grumble about her devotion to 
quilting, but he good-naturedly draws off the fan patterns for her 
with a piece of chalk and a string: 
But I always make my husband lay mine off. Cause he can do 
a better job than I can. He can keep it more evener than I 
can. But he's always laid mine off for me. I'll make out 
like to him I can't lay them off. I could. 
The Wheel quilt is one of Carrie Severt's favorite patterns. It 
allows her to use efficiently the many scraps of fabric given to her 
by friends and neighbors. She will use any type of fabric for her 
20 
quilts; thus polyester double-knit, flannel, and even blanket material, 
often appear in the spokes of her wheels. White is the only color 
banished from her color schemes; "You can use a little white in the quilt," 
she says, "but I don't like too much white. It's too easy to show 
dirt." She makes no attempt to coordinate the colors or patterns of 
fabrics even in the four sections of background material. The result 
is a bold quilt that adds a riot of color and pattern to her simply 
decorated, almost austere, bedrooms. 
The Lone Star and Tree quilts illustrate Carrie Severt's prefer¬ 
ence for solid, rich colors. The Tree quilt is also a fine example 
of her lack of concern for exact repetition and precision in creating 
the blocks in a quilt. Some trees face different directions, and others 
have fewer branches than their neighbors. The joinings are not of 
equal width, and corners frequently do not meet. A rigid adherence 
to a superimposed set of rules is not a part of Mrs. Severt's 
aesthetic sensibility. Improvisation, in other words, may play a 
greater role in white quilting traditions than we had previously 
thought. 
Naturally most women do not fit neatly into one category or the 
other. Quilters like Ila Patton have always made both plain and fancy 
quilts. Other women, such as Ruth Holbrook, are plain quilters who were 
21 
plucked out of their community, sent to college, and taught the rules 
of fancy quilting. Still other women, such as Josie Goad, have adapted 
their plain quilting techniques to the demands of the tourist market. 
The quilt patterns she uses are familiar, the colors bold, the linings 
often figured sheets, and the familiar fan quilting predominates, but 
the quilt has been refined slightly to make it a more appealing item. 
Ila Patton's quilt collection clearly represents the work of a 
woman who could piece such contemporary and complicated patterns as 
the Cathedral Window, but preferred the simpler strip quilt stitched 
in elaborate fans with contrasting thread. Mrs. Patton also made a 
regional favorite, the Nine of Diamonds, a simple nine patch turned 
on its point. One is joined with navy blue joinings and quilted in 
diagonal lines drawn on with flour and water: 
We would dip yarn string in, take a little flour and make a 
little paste and put that yarn string in it and fasten it 
from one corner to the other and just flip it, and it would 
draw these lines clear through, and I believe that's the way 
this is laid off. 
Ila Patton also uses "secret tacking" to stitch her quilts; one long 
stitch, about an inch long, is hidden in the filler and only the small 
stitch shows. It is, she says, "a little easier and quicker done." 
Basically plain quiIters use their ingenuity to create an item 
that is both useful and visually intriguing. This quilting style 
most clearly preserves the traditional process of quilting--using 
scrap materials to make a product for immediate use. These everyday 
quilts have not received the attention they deserve, and the unique 
principles of design that underly them deserve further examination. 
22 
III. Fancy Quilts 
The fancy quilt, on the other hand, has been analyzed, discussed, 
and photographed in great detail. Four of the quiIters I interviewed 
are considered fancy or "quality" quiIters by their community, and 
they consider their own work to be fancy quilting. "I call it fancy 
quilting; I don't know what other people call it," one woman said. 
Although these women often live within a mile or two of their 
plain quilting neighbors, they are only vaguely familiar with the 
quilt made for "service" because their networks are limited to 
other fancy quiIters. Most are college educated, and a few are former 
schoolteachers. They get some of their quilting information and 
inspiration from printed sources--books, magazines, and quilting news¬ 
letters. Generally they enjoy a higher socio-economic status than 
plain quiIters. One woman, for example, quilts with her husband 
each winter; "it's good therapy," she says. They try to complete 
four or five quilts before they move to Florida for the rest of the 
winter months. 
All fancy quiIters grew up in families with strong quilting 
traditions. Most began as plain quilters, but soon improved their 
aesthetic and technical skills. "I've changed from plain quilting 
to fancy wreaths and fancy designs," says Lura Stanley. "Now I 
quilt for the beauty of a quilt. I make quilts just for the beauty 
and not really for the service." These women seldom speak 
in reverential tones about the quilting of their forebears. Crystal 
Cruise of Meadows of Dan, Virginia, recalls that her mother's quilts 
were "not what I would call pretty." She continues: 
My mother never did a nice job of quilting. She did a lot 
of quilting, but it was never what I considered a nice job. 
23 
I guess she didn't have the time. She was a very busy 
person raising that many children, and my father was sick 
for fifteen years. I expect it was more or less for warmth 
that she quilted. 
These women recognize that their mothers and grandmothers quilted in 
the fashion of the day, "more for warmth than beauty," but they also 
believe that their ancestors just did not know as much about quilting. 
These four women have been directly and indirectly influenced by 
the complex forces that struck the region after 1930. Craft shops 
grew up along the Blue Ridge Parkway bringing new ideas to the region 
and offering a sales outlet for the local women who sought both the 
income and prestige associated with handcraft sales. The most recent 
quilting revival, which apparently reached the area in the early 1970's, 
made the craft a socially acceptable and even a desirable skill. Nora 
Glasco, a fancy quilter from Ennis, North Carolina, most clearly dates 
the beginnings of that revival in a rather poignant narrative: 
My father died about seven or eight years ago, and we were 
going through the house; they lived in an older type house, 
and we were going through and kept seeing these raggy quilts 
Some of them were just threadbare, but they were beautiful. 
They were the older type materials. We burned a lot. A few 
months later, some people came down and told us that these 
quilts were worth a lot of money. 
Craft shop owners from major urban areas now scour the region looking 
for quilters; local professionals of some prestige--the minister or 
physician, for example--admire the woman's handwork. But most impor¬ 
tant are the family members who have a new appreciation of the women's 
technical skill and aesthetic judgment and in this subtle way encourage 
her to spend long hours at the quilting frame producing an item they 
know will eventually be theirs. 
24 
Federal and state programs have also intervened on several levels 
to influence regional crafts. Government sponsored craft outlets tried 
to help the quilters improve their skills and thereby increase the 
marketability of their quilts. One craft shop manager told a quilter 
that creativity was the essence of craft and urged her to be more creative 
in her work. Zenna Todd's response is almost a classic statement of 
the power of tradition even in the mind of the fancy quilter: 
They wanted me to come up with some kind of pattern just, 
you know, that I could do, something that I would think 
about creating myself. Very creative. But I've never 
got in on that. I told them I didn't want to concentrate 
that much on it. I don't mind changing something just a 
little bit, or maybe doing it a different way to what 
somebody else has done, but they said that that was really 
craft when you done that. And I guess it is. 
Finally an 0E0 craft program administered by Appalachian State College 
in Boone, North Carolina, affected the lives of both low and middle 
income quilters in the North Carolina portion of our region. Quilter 
Ruth Holbrook learned through that program that, although she knew how 
to quilt, she was doing everything wrong: 
I just used the same material that my dresses were made out of. 
I didn't press my seams open. I did use big thread. I 
quilted them all in fans. Didn't know no different. Or 
diamonds. After I read those books, and that lady told me 
I was doing everything, I knowed how to do it, but I was 
doing it wrong. I got matching my colors and material, and 
things like that. I can sell them faster than I can make 
them. In fact, they're most of the time sold before they're 
put in the frame. 
Now she makes enough plain quilts to "keep my bed warm," and sells 
the fancy ones she learned how to make at the college. 
25 
In the hands of the fancy quiIters, the craft is no longer a 
salvage craft. These women spend both time and money shopping for 
fabrics to use as quilt pieces, filler, and linings. As Ruth Holbrook 
quickly learned, used fabrics have no place in the products of a 
college trained quiIter. 
Relatively rigid rules dictate the colors, patterns, and fabric 
content of a fancy quilt. Fabrics for the quilt top should be a 
small print in colors that sell well; local women chuckle about the 
popularity of so-called "earth tones," especially brown. Those were 
colors seldom found in a quilt until the quilting revival. The print 
should be nicely coordinated with solid colors, and both should be a 
cotton or a cotton-polyester fabric. The filler is most often 
Mountain Mist polyester or a cotton-polyester blend, which gives the 
quilt a nice, puffy look. The lining should be a solid color, prefer¬ 
ably a white or off-white sheet or unbleached muslin. Finally the 
edges of fancy quilts are usually bound with bias tape, either home¬ 
made or store bought,in a color that matches the quilt's top or 
lining. 
Technically these quilts are also very similar. They are quilted 
in white thread which usually matches the lining, and the quilting is done 
"by the piece" with elaborate quilting patterns in the solid blocks 
and around the border. An astonishing amount of creative research goes 
into developing a unique quilting pattern. Some women borrow patterns 
from neighbors; others adapt them from pattern books. Nora Glasco 
traced the outline of an overturned bottle; "it was shaped so pretty," 
she says, "that I copied it off and made a quilt pattern." These 
quiIters also follow the well-known rules set down for fancy quilting 
26 
stitches. "They all want them little fine stitches," Ruth Holbrook 
says. In piecing, the quilter must use sixteen stitches to 
the inch and in quilting, ten to twelve stitches to the inch. 
Although many women may violate one or more of these rules on 
occasion, their overall purpose in adhering to the general principles 
of fancy quilting seems clear. They are creating an item with a 
self-conscious eye to both the past and the future. They are re¬ 
creating the quilt as they believe it existed in the past. The model 
they follow, however, is not that of their own region, but rather the 
Pennsylvania-German model which has set the standard for this most 
recent quilting revival. Lura Stanley, for example, searches for hard- 
to-find small calico prints because "those calicos of a long time ago 
were small flowers." One craft shop owner bans polyester from her 
shop and urges her quilters to use cotton filling. "She says its 
the old time way of doing it," I was told. Many quilters refuse her 
request because "its very hard to quilt, and it just doesn't hold 
up as well." This careful probing of the past brings with it a 
corresponding look into the future. Quilts are now made for succeed¬ 
ing generations. "I hope my quilts are here for the . . . 21st 
century and maybe longer if they're taken care of," says Lura Stanley. 
Finally many of these quilts are made to be sold, and their 
mobility is astounding. Anyone who believes that quilts are still 
being pieced by little, white-haired women who quilt them alone in 
their living rooms or with the church quilting bee is hopelessly 
romantic. Quilts are moving from one end of the continent to the 
other. Quilt tops pieced in Georgia and Washington are quilted in 
the Blue Ridge and later shipped back to Washington or on to New England. 
27 
Quilts are pieced by one woman and quilted by others who send them to 
a third for re-sale. Regional patterns at this level are breaking 
down as quilts move rapidly into and out of a specific community. 
One tie that binds these communities together is use; most 
women who make and women who buy fancy quilts use them in bedrooms as 
bedspreads. They are an investment meant to be seen and appreciated 
in an appropriate environment. Only in craft shops did I see quilts 
and quilt patterns used in unconventional ways. Craft shops fre¬ 
quently display quilts hanging from a wall or covering tables. A quilt 
pattern on a pillow, obviously, is the most common revival form of 
quilting, and several fancy quiIters make pillows as gifts or for 
sale in local shops. Very few use them in their own homes. 
While many fancy quilts are sold, others are given as special 
gifts to members of the community. The highest use to which a quilt 
can be put, however, is to serve as a heirloom for children and 
grandchildren. The quiIters expect their children to use these quilts-- 
as bedspreads more than blankets perhaps--but basically they are to be 
cherished as a legacy from a skilled parent or grandparent. Scorned 
is the child who does not appreciate such a gift. "I made my son 
two real fancy quilts," Ruth Holbrook told me. "He didn't appreciate 
them. He throwed them on the bed, and he smoked and burnt holes in 
them. Won't get no more." 
Lura Stanley, for example, is a fancy quilter who never sells 
her quilts, but gives them to her children and grandchildren as 
gifts. "My grandchildren know how to work me," she says with a 
laugh. She knows that people could not afford to pay her 
28 
what these quilts are worth to both her and her family: 
The money doesn't excite me at all. I would not sell a quilt. 
I give my quilts. There's too much time and effort put in a 
quilt for me to sell. I'd have to have more than people would 
give for my quilts. They're large; they're large enough for 
spreads, and there's so much time in them that I don't think 
people would pay me what I'd have to have for my quilts, so I 
just give them. 
Lura is an unconventional Blue Ridge quilter in many ways. She quilts 
with a hoop instead of a large quilting frame. This makes her quilts 
looser than some, but also makes it easier for her to quilt the 
elaborate circular patterns she finds so appealing. She draws all of 
her own quilting patterns onto the top of the quilt using a homemade 
stencil and a soft lead pencil. In making the circular feather 
wreath, for example, she uses a handy saucer to draw the basic circle 
and then draws each feather by hand. 
Lura does not consider herself the best at making quilts; her 
work is "passable" she says. When she started quilting some fifteen 
years ago, she began with the Drunkard's Path, which she quilted "in 
the seam" instead of one quarter inch from the seam. She did not want 
her big stitches to show; now her stitches are smaller, but she still 
uses linings with small prints to hide the stitches on the quilt's 
reverse side. Because she matches her quilting thread to each color 
in the quilt top, this patterned lining also masks the variety of 
thread colors on the back. "I ignore my lining when I'm quilting, 
and I quilt for the top of the quilt," she says, "the color that the 
material is." 
Mrs. Stanley considers a quilt a "beautiful art work," and thus 
places her emphasis on the pieced or appliqued quilt top pattern, 
29 
which she purchases or creates herself. Her prize quilt seems to be 
a Sunburst pattern copied from a magazine and pieced in the familiar 
earth tones: 
I got it from a little tiny picture in a magazine of some 
famous quilt in a museum somewhere. Just a little tiny 
picture, and I thought that was so pretty. It was in color. 
But it didn't show the outside of the quilt; it just showed 
the center. 
She had no idea how to fill in the border of the quilt and finally 
made up her own pattern of LeMoyne Stars pieced from various shades 
of orange, beige, and brown. 
Again,toward the end of our Blue Ridge stay, the whole process 
of field teamwork blossomed during one fascinating morning of work. 
As I interviewed Mrs. Stanley, Lyntha and Terry Eiler photographed 
her quilts by hanging them over a line strung between two trees. It 
was the first time she had ever seen them displayed this way, and 
instead of the mundane discussion of each quilt I expected, I 
recorded a wonderfully spontaneous outburst of praise for each quilt. 
"I didn't know they were so pretty," she said softly at first and then 
much louder. "I had really never seen them outdoors," she continued, 
"Isn't that gorgeous. It is really." Finally she concluded, "I 
don't usually brag on my handiwork, but when I see them a-hanging out 
on the line, they do look so pretty." Clearly the folk aesthetic-- 
the joyous outburst when confronted by the attractive item--was 
evident in her remarks and reserved for the patterns, color combin¬ 
ations, and quilting on the quilt top. ^ 
Nora Glasco is another fancy quilter who quilts primarily for 
other people. She, her mother, and her sister used to quilt from 
30 
ninety to one hundred quilts a year during their peak quilting period. 
Working from an unfinished store front, they quilted tops for customers 
both within and without the region and their own for resale at a nearby 
craft shop. 
The Log Cabin quilt Nora was working on alone when I saw her tells 
us much about Blue Ridge fancy quilting. The top, a pattern fairly 
common in the area, had been pieced in Georgia and was sold already to 
a New England woman. Mrs. Glasco would do all the fancy quilting for 
forty dollars. The quilt colors are the modern earth tones; the 
pattern is small and the solid colors blend well with the pattern. 
Mrs. Glasco was quilting it "by the piece" and trying to plan a fancy 
quilting pattern for the border around the edge of the quilt. The 
final product would surely be an elaborate but mellow quilt that would 
fit into any modern bedroom decor. 
Mrs. Glasco has an older Lone Star quilt pieced from old neckties 
by her grandmother some thirty years ago. The juxtaposition of 
patterns now seems jarring to her, and she talked to me about tearing 
the quilt top apart and adding rows of solid colors to it to give it 
a more contemporary appearance. Surely the values of the quilting 
revival have influenced both the technical skills and aesthetic 
sensibilities of these fancy quiIters. 
IV. The Process 
In terms of performance, Blue Ridge quilting is, and always has 
been, a solitary, or at most, a family affair. Again climate and 
vernacular architecture may have caused this. Rooms in private homes 
are relatively small and not conducive to eight or ten women moving 
31 
about a rather large quilting frame. Churches in the area lack large 
social rooms, and thus there seems to be no suitable place for women 
to gather. In any event most women prefer spending two or three 
solitary days stitching on a quilt suspended from the ceiling of a 
small bedroom or living room. 
I heard of only three quilting groups, all of which were 
relatively modern innovations. We observed two of these groups at work. 
One, organized by the local Homemaker's Club in North Carolina, is 
held in an old abandoned house. A second group of women filled the 
basement of the Baptist Church in Meadows of Dan, Virginia. Even 
this so-called quilting bee reflects the area's major thrust toward 
solitary quilting. The entire group gathers on the first day to put 
in and begin work on the quilt. Then the women come in by one's, 
two's, and three's each day until the quilt is finished. Crystal 
Cruise, the group's organizer, describes the process: 
Sometimes you'll be in quilting all by yourself, and 
sometimes you'll have somebody with you, you know. You 
don't hardly ever meet all in a group. Maybe the first 
day, but where you're having this group quilting, you 
don't always have them all there. 
Mrs. Cruise remains the primary force behind the Church group's quilting. 
She pieces many of their quilt tops, and each year she and her husband 
quilt four or five quilts, including elaborate applique patterns which 
she purchases in kit form. When I visited her, she was piecing a Grand¬ 
mother's Flower Garden sent to her from the state of Washington. She tried 
to stitch the fifteen hundred hexagons together by hand. Finally, overwhelmed 
by the task, she threw the bundle down in disgust, and her husband 
solved the mathematical puzzle after she fled the house. She asked 
32 
the Church ladies to quilt the top for sentimental reasons even though 
she knew that some would not do a good job. Occasionally she brings 
the quilts home and tears out the most offensive stitches. "On 
my own quilts," she warns, "I would not recommend group quilting." 
Ten women gathered at the Meadows of Dan Baptist Church one 
Thursday morning. Four team members recorded the event on film and 
tape. The highly self-conscious women still managed to discuss the two 
major events of the week--a local woman had won the title of Miss 
America and the National Park Service had once again provoked the 
community. Family and community gossip intertwined with comments 
about the quilt and quilting itself. After the obligatory covered 
dish dinner and a visit by the minister, the group continued to quilt 
until 4:00. Once a woman took me off to the side to tell an off¬ 
color joke, and the minister discussed local politics with me in 
some detail. The event was surely contrived, but then most Blue 
Ridge quilting bees are more or less. 
The strong emphasis on the social dimension of quilting keeps 
us from looking deeper into a woman's psyche to discover other forces 
that drive her to the quilting frame and threaded needle. The 
solitude, sense of comfort, and need for beauty are all aspects of 
the craft that deserve further exploration. As we delve into quilt¬ 
ing from an art historian's or sociologist's point-of-view and search, 
as we must, for the item's regional boundaries, the subtle nuances in 
the woman's personality must not be overlooked. 
33 
V. Conclusions 
Blue Ridge quilts, like quilts everywhere, are intimately tied 
to the region in which they are created. Basically they were used to 
keep warm in an area with low income, cold winters, and drafty houses. 
In our search for deeper social and aesthetic meanings, we cannot 
ignore this basic and fundamental fact. If we do we may well over¬ 
look that very interesting body of quilts tucked away in closets through¬ 
out the country--the plain quilt. 
Farm wives showed tremendous ingenuity and skill in creating 
quilts from the remnants of their environment--the scraps, feedbags, 
and worn out socks that eventually reappeared in quilts. Their pieces 
did not match and their stitches were sometimes too large, but these 
quilts too reflect an aesthetic that has only begun to be explored 
among some black quiIters. White non-Pennsylvania-German quilts also 
deserve attention. 
Now that Appalachia has been discovered as a fashionable area 
of poverty and old-timey ways, fancy quilts in particular illustrate 
the results of government intervention, folk craft enthusiasm, and the 
quilting revival in general. The Blue Ridge Parkway, slashing through 
the region, provided a market for women who wished to sell quilts that 
met certain standards. Federal poverty programs, on the other hand, 
attempted to squash local quilting traditions and replace them with 
those deemed aesthetically and technically superior. Thus if the Blue 
Ridge experience is any example, future studies of quilts should also 
examine the positive and negative aspects of the quilting revival as 
it is manifested in regional tourism and federalism. 
34 
Basically, however, these quilts—both plain and fancy--i11ustrate 
for me the values I heard so often articulated in the personal 
narratives, jokes, and gossip these women shared with me—the value 
of home, family, and community. Nora Glasco expressed it verbally 
when she compared her seventeen years in the Hanes textile mill with 
work in her home and church: 
When you go into a factory, so much of the time, I speak 
for a lot of people, I think, when I say this, you feel like 
that you just go in and your life is just revolved around 
a machine. When you're home doing your housework, doing 
things for the neighbors, working with your church, working 
with craft groups and things, you feel like you have broader 
view of life and you feel like your life is more wholesome 
and worthwhile. You don't make any money, but you sure do 
enjoy yourself a lot more. Factory work is fine for those 
that enjoy it; I did not enjoy it, only for the people. 
Zenna Todd's crazy quilt illustrates those same values in material 
form. Pieced from her children's old clothing, the quilt contains, 
in embroidery, the family's secrets and jokes. Sewing materials, an 
old phonograph, a pet duck, and even Mrs. Todd's own hand complete 
with the nail polish her children tease her about, are all recorded 
in this document. Fancy or plain—directly or indirectly—the 
Blue Ridge quilt is both a protector and documentor of family life. 
We folklorists, then, who are particularly interested in the 
values and creative activity of women, need to discover what women 
are really saying and doing. We need to investigate regional styles 
in quilting as well as other types of handwork. We need to investi¬ 
gate socio-economic factors as they relate both to the item and to 
the process. Finally we need to document the entire range of 
materials created by women in their domestic careers. "Now do you 
reckon that they will enjoy seeing quilts like this?" Mamie Bryan 
asked. The answer should be yes.

Many contemporary studies listed in the above bibliographies focus 
primarily on the quilt top as a work of art. See, for example, 
Jonathan Holstein, American Pieced Quilts (Washington, D.C.: 
Smithsonian Institution, 1972); Jonathan Holstein, The Pieced Quilt: 
An American Design Tradition (Greenwich, Connecticut: New York 
Graphic Society, Ltd., 1973); Lenice Ingram Bacon, American Patchwork 
Quilts (New York: William Morrow and Co., 1973); Effie Chalmers Pfon? 
Progressive Farmer Award Winning Quilts (Birmingham, Alabama, 1974). 
Susan Stewart explores the social and religious dimensions of 
quilting in "Sociological Aspects of Quilting in Three Brethern 
Churches in Southeastern Pennsylvania," Pennsylvania Folklife 23 
(1974): 15-29. Finally, for comments on black quilting traditions, 
see John Michael Vlach, "Quilting" in The Afro-American Tradition 
in Decorative Arts (Cleveland, Ohio: The Cleveland Museum of 
Art, 1978), pp. 44-75. 
3. Two contemporary works attempt to place the quilts within the 
Page 2 
context of the quiltmaker1s lives; see Clarke, and Patricia 
Cooper and Norma Bradley Buferd, The QuiIters: Women and Domestic 
Art (Garden City, New York, 1978). Some older works captured the 
spirit of the quilter as well; see, for example, Ruth E. Finley, 
Old Patchwork Quilts and the Women Who Made Them (Philadelphia: 
J.B. Lippincott Co., 1929). For the best discussion of the 
history of the quilt, see Patsy and Myron Orlofsky, Quilts in 
America (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1974).

Folk!ife Project (Washington, D.C.: American Folklife Center, 
1978), p. 20. 
5. No one considers the quilt to be a "painting" more than Jonathan 
Holstein. See American Pieced Quilts, p. 7; The Pieced Quilt, 
p. 8. Holstein's assumptions about the quilter's vision of her 
own work seem naive, and <8££gv more discussion with women who quilt 
F 
might help him modify some of his remarks. Unfortunately Vlach 
suggests that Holstein's quilt collection is the Euro-American 
norm to which he compares Afro-American quilts, p. 44. Several 
other books serve as excellent guides to quilt top patterns and 
names; see Carrie A. Hall and Rose G. Kretsinger, The Romance of 
the Patchwork Quilt in America (New York: Bonanza Books, 1938); 
Margaret Ickis, The Standard Book of Quilt Making and Collecting 
(New York: Greystone Press, 1949; reprint ed. New York: Dover 
Publications, 1959); Carleton L. Safford and Robert Bishop, 
America's Quilts and Coverlets (New York: E.P. Dutton and Co., 
6. 
1972).

The "sea wave" is also referred to as the "fan" and is "by no 
means exclusive to Wales" according to Averil Colby in Quilting 
(New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1971), p. 50. Colby states 
that the pattern was generally used in borders, but Mavis 
Fitzrandolph in Traditional Quilting: Its Story and Its Practice 
(London: B.T. Batsford Ltd., 1954) includes a photo of a quilt 
with an over-all "sea wave" pattern which looks very much like a 
fan. Joyce Joines Newman in North Carolina Country Quilts 
(Chapel Hill, North Carolina: The Ackland Art Museum, 1978) finds 
that fan quilting predominates in the more "unsophisticated" 
quilts of the Scots-Irish in one of three North Carolina regions. 
For further discussions of fan quilting, see Josephone Lonferdo, 
"Folk Crafts," in Introduction to Folklore, ed. Robert J. Adams 
(Bloomington, Indiana: Indiana University, 1973): 90-99.
