DOMINION TRPITIIE.—The Manager and Actors of the 
Theatre, as well as several of the friends of the For Sisters, 
the two charming Artistes who give such pleasure to the 
frequenters of the Dominion Theatre, met last evening to 
show how highly they had appreciated their talent. 
Headed by a 
band of music, and each one carrying a 
lighted torch in his hand, they narched to the Dominion 
Cafe, where the Sisters Foy resided, and there serenaded 
them. The Manager immediately invited them into the 
drawing-rocm, where an appropriate address, and two mag-
nificent boquets were presented to the two charming Sis-
ters, Bertha and Ida. 
It is a 
well deserved tribute. 
The Sisters Foy have suc-
ceeded in pleasing to the utmost. and in giving the highest 
degree of pleasur -, 
to all those who have witnessed their 
performances .---.1.Wrer!!, (Crtn,pla) Paper. 
ROYAL CAMBRIDGE, M ITSIC HALL, LONDON. — The Sisters 
Foy, are indeed the most graceful duettists we have seen 
upon the music-hall stage, for some years. 
Their business 
is original and is performed in a 
manner perfectly charm-
ing. 
The dancing of Miss Ida Foy is indeed perfection, 
and should tend to make her a 
great and popular favorite.— 
English Paper. 
AN almost entire change of programme occurred 
the 
past week at the Howard Athernetim, Boston, Mass. 
The 
Foy Sisters, Ida and Bertha, opened with the week, and 
their duets have become quite popular, " The Dal Masque" 
being especially good. — Boston Paper.

As sung by file For SISTERS. 
M RS. THOlipSoN. 
WHY does my husband leave me, 
And with false words deceive me, 
Why does his absence grieve me, 
When from home he stays away 
My feelings I 
cannot smother, 
My grief tell to anot7acr, 
There's nought but strife and bother, 
When from home he stays away. 
—Since our wedding, there has been no animosity 
on either side. 
Mr. Thompson, my husband, will provoke 
me by saying he is my lord and master. 
Whoever made this 
man my 1..)rd and master? I 
suppose it must have been the 
parson and that little word 
Yes." Now I 
have a 
good mind 
to say " Yes" no more, and to say " No," instead. 
What a 
curious little word this is; it draws my lips together (looks 
into a 
1pol-dug glass). 
No- o- o-o ! oh, how it puts my mouth 
out of shape; but nevertheless I 
shall give it a 
trial and try to 
cure him of his j 
7alousy. 
Oh, there he comes ; now gentle-
men, please don't look at me, he's awfully jealous. 
(She leaves. 
M R. THOMPSON enters.) 
(HE 
Sings.) 
Oh, I've got a 
teasing wife, 
Full of trouble full of strife, 
She plagues me every hour of my life, 
Perpling Mistress Thompson; 
No matter how I 
try to please, 
I 
never get a 
moment's ease, 
11 wish her tongue from noise would cease 
Charming Mistress Thompson.

I

Now, I

ALL AMONG THE CLOVER. 
Sung by the Fox SisTEns. 
Some people love to roam about on a 
starry night, 
Well that's the very sort of thing that fills me with delight, 
For I'm a 
happy sort of lad who dearly loves a 
spree, 
All among the clover, that's the style for me. 
Cuor.us. 
It's all among the clover, in the merry month of May, 
When the clay is over, to the fields I 
hie away, 
Sniff the balmy breezes in the dell, 
And place my heart's affections on the girl I 
love so well. 
Now don't you think its very nice, in such a 
scene as this, 
To fix your arm around her waist—steal a 
gentle kiss ! 
And whisper talcs of love to her, end pre.,3 
her to your heart, 
And vow by all the purple heads your love will ne'er depart. 
It's all among the clover, &c. 
Then pluck the gentle clover, that blushes at her feet, 
And robe your love in garlands there's nothing half so sweet, 
The rose will mantle on her cheek, her eyes will sparkle 
bright I 
All among the clover, on a 
Summer's night. 
It's all among the clover, &c. 
There's nothing in this wide, wide world, could please you 
half so well, 
As strolling in the clover, with tales of love to tell, 
It makes your heart rebound with joy, and fills your soul 
with bliss! 
To stroll among the clover, and steal a 
loving kiss! 
It's all among the clover, &e.

"VERY SULIPICIOITS."

./ 
the Hay. 
EL. 
The first years of our matrimonial life, 
I 
considered extremely delicious, 
But lately my charming and dutiful wire, 
You appear to be very suspicious ; 
I 
cannot wall: out by myself half a 
mile, 
Or dine with a 
few hearty fellows, 
But a 
frown on your face takes the place of a 
smile, 
gr ,, 7731 so exce6sively jealous. 
SHE. 
SpoKEN.----And why, Sir ? 
7)u go out with the boys, Sir ! 
You go out with the boys, 
l)rinking champagne all the night, 
And kicking up a 
noise. 
You go out with the boys, Sir, 
Yru go out with the boys ! 
Instead of being home with me, 
You go out NV 
t 
1.(1 boys ! 
AIR. - 
in a 
Balloon. 
Suspicious you say, no wonder indeed, 
Your condue -
rs outrao
"eons. 
Go on Tvia'm, proceed, 
Your mauner am eharm:ng and lady-like, quite. 
You may sneer as you please, Sir, but you know fin right, 
It's lucky my temper is even and tni:d. 
nemarkably so, quite the style of a 
child, 
A 
temper like yours, when your tongue is unfurrd, 
Would make a 
man wish himself out of the world. 
Up in a 
balloon, Ala'ain, up in a 
balloon, 
There's where I 
shall wish myself, 
Belie-ye me, very soon. 
Up in a 
balloon, ala'ana, 
Up in a 
balloon! 
I 
should get a 
little peace, 
If I 
was up in a 
balloon ! 
meet thee in the Lane. 
[SnE.] 
Yon promised to be at home Sir, at six to dine, 
Instead of that you eme at half past nine. 
[HE.] 
Allow me to explain love, 
And then you'll not complain, love ; 
'Business detain'd love. 
Till the clock struck nine! 
Not business, Sir, but pleasure. 
The home you one did treasure, 
You come to at year leisure, 
And wish me to hAieve 
That business could detain you 
"Till half past nine. 
If that is your excuse, Sir, I 
must decline 
r.s2o hear another word Sir, 
Such quibbles are absurd, Sir. 
Why cannot I 
convince this wife of mine?

A 
nt.—..1 orrible Tale. 
[FIE.] 
I've often heard it said and sung, 
That men and women, old and young, 
If e'er convinced against their will 
Were of the same opinion still ; 
And as I

MY HEARTS BEST LOVE. 
Sung by BERTHA Fol.. 
My heart's best love, thou art mine own! 
Bright star of hope, that guides me o'er life's main! 
My fondest dream is thine alone, 
My dearest wish, to meet the once again! 
When thou art near, my life is calmly flowing, 
Thine eyes are beams of sweet and joyous light; 
Thy gentle smiles their kindly rays bestowing, 
These are like Lleav'n unto my longing sight!

My heart's best love ! my joy each day ! 
My dream by night! my rose in winter drear ! 
I

stray, 
And sigh in vain, and wish that thou wert ever near!

THE HAPPY POLICEMAN, 
27 
Sung by the Foy SISTERS. 
[Robert.) 
Thro' Squares and Street corners, 
On my beat how I 
wander, 
Thinking of one who is dearest to me ; 
She lives over yonder, 
Sixteen is the number, 
If she'd be my bride oh how happy I'd be. 
lIer name is Susannah, genteel is her manner, 
I've long loved her dearly, as no tongue can tell ! 
But I 
feel like a 
lost man, of 1:te, there's the Postma 
Obtains all her smiles, and good graces as well. 
Why Should I 
grieve, how foolish I 
must be, 
Very plainly seeing that she don't care for me, 
But I 
will know my fate, whatever it may be; 
I'm a 
broken-hearted servant of her Majesty. 
I 
hear her voice singing she's coming this way. 
(Susannah heard singing 
With a 
ulio Is ! With a

With a 
ulio, ulio, ulio Is ! 
With a

[Susannah.] Oh ! Robert, what ails yon, pray? / 
You're looking as pale as a 
Ghost, man. 
Yqs ! day by day I 
waste away, 
Since I 
saw you speak to the Postman. 
You know for years I've lov'd you true, 
And I'm not bad looking!

Don't boast, man.

I'm sure I've heard quite enough. 
Ton my word, 
I

only wish I 
were a 
Bird. 
So you arc quite a 
Goose for your pains. 
Your cuts they will kill me, 
Oh ! why be so cold?

And you've often been told, 
" 
That I 
never would have you,

I

Your frowns I 
cannot bear ?

Don't stand whining there, 
The Postman I 
prefer, 
For you I 
do not care. 
[Robert.] 
Oh! Susannah, you drive me to despair. 
[Susannah.] We Sir, should never agree, 
You are so dreadfully jealous 
[Robert.] 
Well, but the Postman you see. 
[Susannah.] Is one of the best teraper'd fellows; 
He never comes to upbraid me, 
In this cross ill-bred manner! 
[Robert.] 
I'm sorry for what I've said, 
Wed and forgive me, Susannah! 
[Susannah.] Married I'd certainly be. 
But you must never b.--; 
jealous. 
And everybody shall see, 
What a 
dutiful wife I 
wiffbe; 
And everybody will see, 
What a 
dutiful wife she will be.

Nothing like the present, 
Time is on the wing, 
So early in the morning 
I

And when I'm made Inspector, 
Happy we will be ! 
[Susannah.] Yes, we'll be happy yet, 
If you'll remember me ! 
You shall be object of my idolatry, 
And our time will pass away in true felicity. 
Yes, early in the morning, 
I ( you) will buy the ring,

No time like the present,

PET OF THE ARGYLL. 
Written and sung by Jonx   
I 
was born and brought up in the West,. 
In the City of Chicago! 
But for pleasure I 
took a 
trip East, 
Our Western styles for to show 
With the Upper-Tendem I 
go; 
The Ladies all on me do smile, 
No party is complete without me,. 
Oh! John of the Argyll! 
I'm the Pet of the Argyll, 
The Beau of the Ball ; 
he Pink of Perfection, 
Acknowledged by ; 
The leader of fashions, 
I 
carry the sway ; 
Of all other swells, 
I'm the swell of the day! 
I 
never retire ' till daylight, 
For fun never begins before one, 
And the Can Can, it is my delight! 
While others do think it is wrong. 
I've a 
Box at the Olympic each night, 
I 
know Williams's songs all by heart, 
But the Ballet is what I 
erjoy, 
For at dancing I 
can play a 
part. 
I'm the pet of the Argyll, 4ke, 
I 
rise every morning at ten, 
Take breakfast of course, in my room ; 
Then read o'er the personals in the Herald, 
Then take a 
short drive before noon. 
Then to pass the time away, 
I 
play billiard..4 and have a 
few smiles ; 
But when the clock strikes twelve at night, 
Then you'll find me at the Argyll ! 
I'm the Pet of the Argyll, Ike.

Oh! my heart is broke, God knows it is, 
Since Terry first joined the " gang." 
When he came home last Thursday night, 
Sure I 
talked to him very nice ; 
When he said old man! you're getting too fresh, 
And we'll soon have to put you on ice! 
He told the old woman for to take a 
drop, 
And to shut up giving him her slang ; 
Oh! her heart is lftoke. God knows it is, 
Since Terry first joined the " gang." 
He'll come rolling home, Jrc. 
Sure, he stands upon the corner 
From morning until night; 
And if the policeman says, " move on," 
He'll spit at him with spite. 
He went to the market only yesterday, 
And there he stole a 
big ham; 
And he got three months in the Penitentiary, 
Along with the rest of the " gang !" 
He'll come rolling home, cte.

WAIT TILL THE MOONLIGHT FALLS. 
CEASE your repining, bright eyes are shining, 
Font, ! Icart:!,. 
are melting with fervent love; 
Red cheeks, are paling, sweethearts bewailing, 
Tarry not one moment from the girl you love. 
She's sure to cheer you when she comes near you, 
She's ever waiting for the fond sweet kiss; 
If you're inclined for a 
midnight ramble, 
Tell me what you think of a 
scene like this. 
Wait till the moonlight falls on the water, 
Then take your sweetheart out for a 
walk, 
Mind what you say, boys, that's how to court her, 
Tell her that you'll wed when the days grow short. 
See when the moonlight falls on the streamlet, 
Silvering each ripple with its brilliant rays; 
Out in the midnight, making the heart bright, 
Waking up the little birds before the break ot day. 
Tickling and teazing, kissing and squeezing, 
Telling lots of little fibs, and swearing they are true, 
Some say it's naughty, others very pleasing, 
Just wait one moment and I'll tell you what to do. 
Wait till the moonlight, &c, 
Sung by ELLA. W ESSER. 
SOME like garden parties, some like flower shows, 
For doing some spooning, just " Under the rose," 
Some are partial to concerts, or lectures so staid, 
But my weakness, I 
fear, is the gay masquerade. 
CHORUS. 
Pm awfully fond of the gay masquerade, 
The gay masquerade, the bright masquerade, 
With sweet pretty darlings in costume arrayed, 
The gay masquerade for me. 
Some dances are like Quakers' meetings in style, 
So " starchy," and formal, one scarce sees a 
smile; 
But to do as one likes without feeling afraid, 
By Jove the right place is the gay masquerade. 
CHOPXS. 
I'm awfully fond of the gay masquerade, 
The gay masquerade, the dear masquerade, 
With sweet " tootsie wootsies" so sweetly arrayed, 
The gay masquerade for me. 
To say most daring things, ' us the easiest task, 
To some elegant cre.ture whilst wearLig a 
mask ; 
Oh the tales I 
have told, and the vows I 
have made— 
There's no place for flirting like the gay masquerade, 
CHORUS. 
I'm awfully fond of the gay masquerade, 
The gay masquerade, the bright masquerade, 
With dear " popsy wopsies," so gaily arrayed, 
The gay masquerade for me. 
Each lady that's masked, for " a 
beauty," don't take

I'm in love with such a - harming little man.

love him better than gold or wealth, 
When I

When Charlie played the drum.

When Charley plays the drum. 
Oh! he often comes to take me for a

And we stray along together, side by side, 
And so sweetly and so lovingly he'll talk; 
And once he ask'd me if I'd be his bride. 
And ev'ry Thursday evening, 
As soon as work is done,

My lover he is going to soft, oh, Nicode-mus! 
He's going away and leaving me, 
To watch the little fishes swimming in the sea ! 
But he will soon wish for home, and to be back with me— 
The ship will heave to, Nicoetemus ! 
And so wretched you will be, so wretched you will be. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, Nicodemus, Nicodemus! don't you go away ? 
I 
love you Nicodemus, and I've loved you many a 
day, 
I 
loved you in your plain attire, your lovely fustian coat, 
Don't leave me Nicodemus, for that boiler bursting boat? 
Salt water you know is very wet, oh, Nicodemus! 
You know you are my only pet, 
And your absence wilLeause me to fume and fret ; 
They will feed you on salt "• junk." and nasty soft boil'd peas, 
Think of this well, Nicodemus, 
Ere you cross those watery seas, those watery seas. 
Oh, Nicodemus, & c. 
Of pumpkins boiled you'll get no more, oh, Nicodemus ! 
Convince yourself of this before, 
You can't run away, there's no back door ; 
" 
Reef the anchor, Nicodemus," the Captain he will say ; 
You'll have to hold on very hard, 
Or you'll be blown away, straight down to Botany Bay. 
Oh, Nicodemus, &c. 
" 
It's no use you talking to me ?" said Nicodemus, 
"For I 
intend a-going to sea, 
Out to China, for Souchong and Congo tea ; 
That's a 
profitable cargo, in fact you can't get better ; 
Direct, Hong Kong, Australia, 
When you send to me a

there lies my angling-rod. 
Luck? you bet! 
Bites? millions 
of them. ' Skeeters though. 
Symphony begins. 
W ILL (BERTHA) sings. 
I 
sauntered down the creek to-day, 
And thought to try my skill, 
I 
cast my line a 
stone's- throw off, 
Below the Old Stone Mill ; 
When, deeply musing, came a 
voice 
Like thunder, too, it seemed, 
' 
Get out, you c'ty pirate! git!" 
'You're fishing in my stream?' 
FANNY ENTERS. 
Away I 
went— the bulking came, 
You see that gaping seam? 
His teeth insertel, tore my pants, 
While fishing in the stream!

He's not the lad to saunter round, 
And idly mope and dream, 
He knows the time when luck's about, 
For fishing in the stream: 
DUET. 
We'll cast our lines, nor fear results, 
Life's ocean's deep and wide, 
We'll cheer each other as we tug, 
While rowing ' gainst the tide; 
And over shoals and hidden bars, 
We'll sail, yes, hand in hand, 
And on the other side, at last, 
Of Jordan, we shall stand! 
So flip your line, nor mind the world 
What is life, but a

There's something more than suckers caul, 
While fishing in the stream!

RUSSELL S
.; CO. 
TO a 
ball I 
was one night invited, 
And being so fond of the dance, 
At the prospect I 
felt quite delighted, 
And eagerly jumped at the chance; 
There were swells looking out, for the belles, 
And belles were looking for beaux, 
But a ' Tat' introduced me to one, 
Whom—thought far out-rivalled the rose. 
SPOKEN .— My friend introduced me to her, saying: " Charlie 
my boy, you're lucky, for—" 
CHORUS, 
This is the belle of the ball, dear boy, 
This is the belle of the ball, dear boy. 
This is the best of them all, dear boy, 
She is the belle of the ball. 
The envy of all the fair dancers, 
She had such a 
fairy-like grace, 
But just iu the midst of the lancers, 
The lady turned black in the face; 
She gurgled, she gasped, and she glared, 
And sized hold of the tails of my coat, 
Alas the top teeth of my partner, 
Had slipped down her b.:.autiful throat. 
SPOE.EN.—Well, there is nothing so awfully detrimental in 
al1 tooth or two, so I 
still thought that 
This is the belle of the ball, dear boy, etc. 
She retired, and wall she'a recovered, 
In a 
quadrille I 
next took her hand, 
When a 
look in her eyes I 
discovered, 
Which somehow I 
could not understand; 
Her eyes were as straight as a 
Venus, 
When I 
gazed at them fondly before, 
But now one eye looked vp at the ceiling, 
And the other o3ked clown on the floor. 
53: 
SPOKEN.—MOSt extraordinary appearance! she evidently, 
had a 
glass eye. 
Some of my friends whispered, " I 
ear,. 
Charlie," 
You've got the belle of the ball, etc. 
How the ladies they giggled and tittered, 
Of course you may easily guess, 
Though my feelings were sadly embittered, 
I 
would not leave a 
gill in distress; 
So we madly rushed into a 
waltz, 
When she stumbled o'er some fellow's leg, 
When off came her hair, twas all false, 
And her head was as baEd as an egg. 
SPOKEN— Horror upon horror—she'd no more hair upon hez. 
respected cranium than you d 
Liscover upon a 
billiard ball. 
I 
found my coat and hat, called a 
cab and went to bed, and 
whenever I 
meet any of my " pals," they cruelly enquire,— 
CHORUS. 
How is your belle of the ball, dear boy ? 
How is the belle of the ball, dear boy ? 
0 
wasn't she bald at the ball, dear boy ? 
Oh, how is the belie of the ball?

We lightly breathe the parting words, 
Good night, and think of me.

••••• 
No one who has read the touching account of the 
misfortunes of Charlotte Temple, with that absorb-
ing interest which is inseparable from Mrs. Row-
son's writings, can rest satisfied while denying them-
selves a 
perusal of the life of Charlotte Temple's 
Daughter, Lucy Temple. 
It is a 
sequel possessed of all the thrilling in-
terest that characterizes the life of the unfortunate 
mother, while it exemplifies in a 
wonderful manner 
" 
the visitation of the sins of the parents upon the 
children." 
It depicts sorrows that refuse the balm of sym-
pathy, and consolations which those around us 
" 
can neither give nor take away." 
It contrasts in 
living colors the richest fruits of virtue and happi-
ness on the one hand, and the bitter end, blighting 
disappointments, and ruin resulting from once yield-
ing to the seductive influence of passion. 
It points a 
moral that commends it to the atten-
tion of all, and is pervaded by an interest that will 
hold the reader in rapt attention to the end.

To those who have never perused the sad story of CIIAIL 
',OTTE TEMPLE, j 
oyed with her in her early pleasures, sym-
pathized and wept with her in her sorrows, and glowedl 
with indignation at the wrongs which she suffered from 
base, calculating villains, an opportunity is afforded of 
reading one of the most absorbing works ever written, 
proving " truth stranger than fiction." 
The poet's lines are but a 
just description of the unfor 
tunate Charlotte Temple: 
Her form was faultless, and her mindt 
Untainted yet by art, 
Was noble, just, humane and kind, 
And virtue warmed her heart. 
But, ah! the cruel spider came—" 
This book, in the language of Mrs. Howson, " affords ft

ginning, in the end leads only to misery and shame."

THE APPRENTICE, ' 
OA 
First Book for Mechanics, Machinists & Engineers 
By OLIVER BYRNE. 
I2mo., cloth. $ 1.50. 
ENDORSEMENTS OF THE PRESS. 
The highest praise which can be given to this excellent 
elementary work on practical mechanics, consists in the fol-
lowing simple statement of facts : The editor of this journal, 
while teaching natural philosophy and chemistry in the 
Cooper Institute from 1859 to 1864, was in need of a 
text-
book of practical mechanics, adapted to the advanced classes 
who had been trained in mathematics; in his search among 
the many mechanical text- books, there was not one which so 
fully answered his requirements as the above work. 
It was 
therefore adopted and used with perfect satisfaction, and it 
is with pleasure that he receives it now as an old friend from 
the publishers, gives it his most earnest recommendation, 
and wishes it in the hands of all who are still in the fog about 
the units of work, calculation of the power of machinery, 
resistance to motion, strain on material, etc.—Manufacturer 
and Builder, July, 1874. 
The author of this work is well known as an extensive 
writer who has made some valuable additions to American 
technical literature, enumerated above in detail. 
The work 
we are now noticing is a 
theoretical treatise on practical me-
chanics, designed to supply a 
recognized deficiency. 
Most 
of the works on mechanics treat the subject in a 
manner 
which is not available to young men commencing as appren-
tices in shops. 
Any young man with a 
fair knowledge of 
arithmetic may, however, use this work to great advantage; 
it is not only suitable for a 
text-book, but also as a 
work 
of reference. 
Most ambitious young men will make them-
selves so familiar with its contents as to be able to refer 
readily to any portion of the book. 
The author has adopted 
a 
new notation to distinguish units of work from other units, 
which is not without value, and might be advantageously 
introduced into more ambitious works. 
The bk 
is well 
printed on good white paper, and bound in stiff 6th covers.
