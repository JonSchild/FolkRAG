DRIVING LEVEE
Oh, I b'lieve I git religion an' jine de church; I'll be a black-jack preacher, an' not have to
work.
Louisiana is a murderer's home; It may be a graveyard, but it's my home.
Goin' to Oklahoma, git behind de sun; I don' mind rollin'; got to roll so long.
I been down jumpin' long; Well, I don' mind rollin', Cap'n; I roll so long.
There ain't but one thing worries my mind; I hate to go leave my Willie behind.
If ever I git back in de country; Gwine tell de boss, “Don't come for me.”
Only one thing I done wrong; Stayed in Texas one day too long.
Oh, what can it be? Heart full o' sorrow an' misery.
I been down to Georgy an' Tennessee; Lookin' for de woman what's crazy 'bout me.
Sung by a group of Negro convicts, Clemens state farm, Brazoria, Texas, April 16, 1939.
