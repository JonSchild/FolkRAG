Dear Ms. Gray,
 
We corresponded about a year ago concerning my interest in btaining
 
at "author's price" copies of my two films:
 
Georgia Sea Island Singers
 $66.40
 
Buckdancer
 $48.46
 
I should l
ike now to order those two f
ilms.  At the time we wrote, you
 
quoted the above prices to me and also informed me I could purchase a
 
copy of the Cantoinetrics Training Tapes by Alan Lomax.  I believe I should
 
prefer to pay l
ist price, which I understand is $
150.00, for that
 
purchase.
 
I enclose my check for $264.86 in hopes that the quoted prices still hold.
 
If not, please inform me, and I shall make up the difference immediately.
 
Thank you for your assistance in this matter.
 
Sincerely,
 
Bess L*ax Hawes
 
P
.S.  If you should wish to telephone me directly about this matter, I can
 
be reached during business hours after Labor Day at 202/682-5449 or before
 
then at my home number 703/243-2271

Dear Sirs:
 
You have been distributing several of my films over t
he past many years,
 
including Pizza Pizza Daddy-U, The Georgia Sea I
sland Singers, and Georgia
 
Buck.  Recently I di cussed with my partnew, John Bishop, putting our
 
other f
ilm, Say Old  i
an Can You Play the Fiddle with another distributor
 
who is working up a package of films on traditional American fiddle styles,
 
but I
'm not sure whether he has written you about this or not.
 
The purpose of my letter i
s to enquire whether or not I might he allowed
 
an  author sI
 discount for order some of these films.
 I particularly would
 
l
ike to buy a copy of the Georgia Sea I
sland Singers and Georgia Buck.
 I
 
should Also like to purchase two copies of my brother's Cantometric Training
 
Tape package (
Alan Lomax).  Would you please send me your current film and
 
tape catatôgues so that I can sn ddin an order, and at the same time let me
 
know if I would qualify for any kind of discount.
 
Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.
 
Sincerely,
 
Bess Lomax Hawes

 For reasons too complex and borin'

t

it, but if you could get it down to a week or something like that
 
f could try to work around that time here.

Dear Bess:
 
During the 1967 Summer Institute in Anthropology you were kind
 
enough to share with us the films of the "Buck Dancers" and the "Sea
 
Islanders."
 
This semester the Black students at MacMurray College have begun
 
study in a course entitled "Afro-American Peoples and Culture," and
 
due to my enthusiastic endorsement of this documentary of American
 
Folk music and dance, would very much appreciate viewing the films.
 
Would you be so kind as to send them as soon as possible--since we
 
would like them for a mid-November seminar?
 
We will naturally reimburse you or the agency involved for shipping
 
and rental when we return the film to you.
 
Your help and consideration will be greatly appreciated.
 
Incidentally, my love for the Auto-Harp has not subsided. Although
 
I hold out no hope for ever being as proficient as John Greenway or you,
 
I do enjoy playing it.  Best wishes to you.
