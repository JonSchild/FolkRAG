VC:  So, this is Monday the 19th of August and I’m here at the dining table of the Deckers, Clark and 
Nancy, and I’d like to do this follow-up interview, particularly with Clark. But Nancy since I know that you 
have a significant role here on the farm, I’d like to have you just, first of all before we talk too much 
about the farm life, just like your own personal background. How you got to the farm, what you grew up 
doing? 
ND: Sure, well Clark and I grew up together here in the same area. We both went to the little two-room 
schoolhouse across from the church when we were kids, up ‘til fourth grade and then on to Potsdam. I 
attended Potsdam State, uh with a major in math. And ended up getting certified to teach math, which I 
taught for two and half years and when we started having the family, I decided I wanted to stay at home 
and raise my children on the farm. I’d seen the wonderful life that could be given to the children here 
and uh, never went back to teaching, so. 
VC: Uh, and your own family history, your personal… 
ND: I…my parents, my father was Walter Everhart. We had a little house right here by the bridge in 
West, live right by the bridge in West Stockholm. He worked in Potsdam, he had Queedle equipment, 
which was the heavy equipment dealership at the time the Seaway came into the area. He was selling 
cranes and dump trucks and was a businessman in the Potsdam area his entire life. 
VC: Uh huh, I remember that company. 
ND: Yeah. 
VC: And , so you actually didn’t grow up on a dairy farm. 
ND: No. 
VC: But you (laughs), so what was your… 
ND: I was a, I was, wonderful 4-H experience, uh I just actually, we were friends for-  
CD: years. 
ND: In the same 4-H club and just friends for years. He went took, he’s, to Cornell but I went to Potsdam 
State. 
VC: I usually don’t like to ask this question but the Library of Congress wants us to know the year of your 
birth? 
ND: Oh, okay. I’m 7-8-54 was my, the day I was born. 
VC: (laughs) And Clark I forgot to ask yours. 
CD: Yeah, I was 8-2-51. 
VC: (laughs) Okay, good. 
CD: Just went by my 62nd. 
VC: Good for you. So, uh so 4-H, let’s talk a little bit about 4-H cause we haven’t talked to that many 
people who had a 4-H experience? 
ND: Oh, we had a major 4-H experience. I started as early as you could, back then it was eight years old 
and thoroughly enjoyed it. We did the cooking, the clothing, chickens, I had poultry even though I lived 
down in the major part of West Stockholm, we still had chickens, and kind of tagged along once in 
awhile when they were at the fair, I could be there a little bit and what a wonderful experience that was, 
to see the showing of the cattle at the fair. But uh, public presentations were a huge lesson to give to 
children, I think to be able to let them feel comfortable talking. So, when we started dating, he was 
already a leader of Busy R 4-H Club. He was doing it while you were in the bank. 
CD: Yup. 
ND: And I helped him and it ended up we were leaders of the club for a while and then when our 
children were born they started Cloverbud, so I just had a lot of little children in the area so I started a 
Cloverbud club. They were six to eight, little kids and they showed as Cloverbuds at the fair but, at the 
time when our boys were probably, um about seven and eight years old, there were a lot of children, 
considering, well there were about ten little boys over here every day. 
VC: (laughs) 
ND: So, I might as well have a 4-H meeting, and do something construct- 
CD: Do something positive with it. 
ND: Build things (laughs). But uh, our children grew up in 4-H too. And they showed at the fair and they 
did public presentations, we used to tell them that they had to do public presentations until they got a 
blue ribbon at state fair. So, they all did as good as they could. 
CD: So they all got blue ribbons at State Fair. (laughs) 
ND: So they could stop doing them. (Laughs) 
CD: Yeah, probably fourth or fifth year they did them, they all ended up- 
ND: qualifying to go. 
CD: Yup, qualifying, so that they uh, didn’t have to extend it out over a long period of time. 
ND: And they did the judging teams, which is another, if you are going to be a child on a farm, know 
what to look for in a good animal and they were on the dairy and livestock judging teams. Horticulture 
judging teams, I think that’s one reason our daughter works, she works at Fort Drum right now as a, uh 
in the environmental, but she’s did wetland elliniation her first year. She’s like an expert on plants, little 
things like- 
CD: A lot of it came from the experience she had, you know when she started- 
ND: Through this horticulture group. And she went on and just studied and studied on her own to know. 
Sh-I didn’t even know there were ten varieties or Golden Rod but this girl- 
CD: And she can identify them. (Laughs)  
VC: Really. 
CD: I know there’s a yellow plant out there and we, us just called it Golden Rod. 
VC: Until you’re allergic to it. Seems most people are. 
ND: Yeah don’t go looking too close. But if I don’t know a plant, when she’s up I have her look at it. 
0:06:00 
CD: Yup, Nancy’s oldest brother had worked here on on the farm with my dad so uh, I think that was 
kind of the way the family could…cause Kenny was interested in uh, showing and uh, was involved with 
our family when we showed at the fair and stuff like this so our families were involved through the 4-H 
and through the local church and stuff so a lot of uh, interactions, our families, so kind of gave us a 
background, got to know each other. 
VC: What’s the value of 4-H? 
ND: 4-H is, uh  not too involved in to at present, although (laughs) 
CD: It’s looking like (laughs), our grandson is five so- 
ND: Grandson is five and I- 
CD: I think cloverbud starts at six. 
ND: I think he will be highly involved and I think it’s tremendous, yes it is tremendous. You know the 
judging, the public presentation, they’re just a little aspect of it but they can learn so much and have the 
social interaction with, when we were in 4-H and we went to 4-H camp too. It was a lot of farm kids and 
of course that picture has changed cause there are not that many farm kids. When our boys were in FFA 
at the school, they had Dave Schifer, who’s tremendous, oh he just did a wonderful ag program but, and 
actually they started the sugar house out there. And um, but he said there were only three farm kids in 
the ag program he had. So to keep the farm community involved too is pretty significant to do that. 
CD: Our oldest son Wade, uh, is the one who took the presentation to the school board to get the sugar 
house project approved. Our next oldest, Mark, was the one that was involved in the construction and 
then our daughter Ann was the first one to be involved in boiling sap there. 
ND: They’re only, like the three of them, the oldest was three and a half when the third was born so 
they were close but, the teacher had one and then another one and another one. It was- 
VC: Sure, interested. 4-H is still active then. It’s still active-  
CD: It’s still in St. Lawrence Country, it’s a lot more independent, I think more independent members 
now, not as many clubs, uh but they are still very active at the camp and at the fair, and I say our 
grandson’s mother’s family has been very involved in 4-H and showing and so it’s just going to be a 
natural progression for him to get involved in 4-H. 
ND: Yes, we’ve got a calf that was just born out here, looking like it’s going to go to the fair next year. 
(Laughs) But our niece Dietre is the director up at 4-H camp this year. 
VC: Oh interesting.  
ND/CD: Meredith’s daughter. 
ND: Jim Tuggey retired and- 
 CD: She took over. 
ND: Dietre took over. 
VC: Very good. Now that’s at- 
CD: Overlook. 
VC: Overlook. Owls Head. 
CD: Yup, 4-H Camp Overlook, Mountain View. 
ND: Mountain View. 
VC: Right, right, interesting. 
ND: It was a very 4-H oriented camp, now with the smaller number of children on farms it’s- 
CD: More urban. 
ND: -different but- she’s 
CD: Still teaches the same classes and yup. We were both counselors there for years. 
VC: Were you. As teenagers or even as adults. 
CD: As teenagers. 
ND: Well, I think even when I was a freshman in college, was my last year. 
CD: Yeah, same with me, freshman or sophomore year. 
0:10:02 
VC: Interesting. So Nancy, so then you moved onto the farm when you were married and you 
immediately, did you immediately start working with animals or with crops or whatever your role has 
evolved to be. 
ND: I think the first year we were married I was still teaching and then I also had- 
CD: I do remember though about two days after we got back from our honeymoon, I stepped off the 
tractor and rolled my ankle, swelled up like a bowling ball and Nancy- 
ND: So I started working on the farm (Laughs), been tired ever since. 
CD: Nancy went over and started milking, yup we were milking on another farm in addition to here at 
that time and at one time we operated three milking herds at three farms. 
ND: I did pretty much milk until I started babysitting for, and that was in 2008, for Owen. I did both the 
milking straight through the whole system. 
VC: Now you say you did the milkings- 
ND: With somebody. 
VC: Cause this farm was different from other farms we’ve been working on. What specific tasks do you 
have to do for milking? On your farm. 
ND: Well when I started we were using a thing called a dumping station, where you’d have to just go in 
with the machine to each individual cow and prep them and milk them and dump the milk into a thing in 
the center of the barn which would then vacuum it back into the tank. But I didn’t go earlier than that. 
Then we ended up going to a pipeline and then it went to automatic takeoffs and meters and then I hurt 
my knee and he decided it was time to build a parlor. 
CD: 2002 we built a parlor. 
ND: And I milked in the parlor, with somebody usually, until I started babysitting. But uh, Wade was 
bringing Owen over at five in the morning so at that point it shifted where I got up and fed  calves and 
then got in so that I could take care of the babysitting. And I milk. 
0:12:20 
VC: And your, uh you told me I’m sure Clark but remind me the size of your parlor? 
CD: Double eight parallel parlor. 
VC: And you’re milking how many now. 
CD: Oh hundred and fifty, sixty, yup. 
VC: I wanna come back to you but Hannah reminded me of a question to ask since I was, I talked with 
you last. One of the points you brought up about keeping the farm the way it was was because of Kefell. 
And as our understanding is that the number’s changing on Kefell. Is that something that would change 
your- 
CD: That was Governor Cuomo’s idea of a way of perhaps allowing dairy farms to expand but the, where 
the, the farmers are still at two hundred animal units or two hundreds milking cows are going to have to 
be responsible for all of the regulations, it’s just that they don’t have to file the paperwork. So, if 
something were to happen and you were to have a manure spill or something that went wrong, you 
would still, could be held liable for DEC for the regulations so. I still believe that the boys will probably 
look at about two hundred, they’re interested in an operation where the two of them and a hired man 
can handle most of it and not look at a, and the other thing to have is land to substantiate the amount of 
feed you need and uh, 
ND: The land based around here, tillable land is- 
CD: Land based, yeah, we have to go, have to have enough, the tillable portion is so small in this section 
of the town that, we’re travelling five six miles to get land as it is, so it really wouldn’t be beneficial.  
There comes a point where you just can’t go any further. 
0:14:30 
VC: So,right right, you’re really probably going to keep where it’s been. 
CD: Gunna stay, they’re hoping to gradually through internal growth grow to about two hundred and 
then call that about it. 
VC: And that would be large enough to sustain a couple of families? 
CD: Uh, it’ll it’ll, it would have to be diversified, I mean while we were doing this, you know I have always 
been involved in maple and sold fire wood and stuff like this and you know there again if you own 
enough land to get a tillable base, you’ve got a lot of other, so we’ve been very involved in getting 
forestry remanagement plans on all of the land that we have so that uh, there will be an opportunity for 
additional income down the road for forestry products too. 
VC: So it’s all in the planning, right? (laughs) Okay, well I want to remember to ask that question and 
that’s a good answer. Okay so, Nancy now then are your various tasks related to the farm these days? 
ND: Well, I am still probably a pop in substitute milker. I do feed the calves. 
CD: Which is a major job. (laughs) How many, any where from 22 to 26 at some times. 
ND: Well it’s small compared to- 
VC: How many? 
CD: 22 to 26 calves. 
VC: Wow. 
ND: The guys are, this more of a bunk house than our home. There’s constant traffic. He’ll eat and then 
one of the boys and another boy and they all come in at a certain time and they all, it’s constant traffic 
here in the house and I am still going to babysit for Wade’s son and I took care of his parents, was 
caregiver for his moth- father for years and now his mother. 
CD: Probably substitute babysitter for Gwen (laughs). 
ND: Oh yeah, I hope so. 
VC: So, from what you know, is this atypical of farm women these days or is it, what are women doing 
on the farm? 
ND: I think it is atypical. I think they are working off side the farm, off off, outside the farm to 
supplement the income if they are at this level of a farm. 
0:17:15 
VC: I grew up with dairy farmers who often had wives who were teachers. 
CD: Right. 
ND: Well I was. 
VC: You were. 
ND: And actually I thought things were sort of slowing down here enough at one point, I thought maybe 
I will get back in and then I’ll have a little more toward my retirement and I interviewed as a teacher aid 
because, you have to get your masters within so many years or your certification, I would have had to 
get my masters to teach again. And when I went for the interview to be a teacher’s aide it looked, you 
know as though, yeah we’ll have you start. Okay so it was how much money will I make and as I thought 
about it, well I’ll need a car and I’ll need clothes and we’ll need to hire somebody to do this  and it 
wouldn’t have paid to do it. I was doing, I had a much bigger garden when the kids were bigger. I used to 
preserve, everything was our own meat and vegetables there for a while. Now I kind of, not all of our 
food was grown on a farm but a lot of it was. 
VC: That’s interesting. 
CD: But if you look at, another thing to keep in mind as you look at some of the more successful farms in 
St. Lawrence County, McKnights, Greenwoods, a lot of these, Fishers, all those cases the wife is very 
active, involved in the farm operation. 
VC: Yes. Often the book keeper, do you do that? 
ND: Yes, I do the books. 
VC: Now are you computerized? 
ND: Yes. 
VC: Are you computerized with, forgive me for asking, it sounds like a dumb questions, but I have been 
learning a lot about the nature of farming in the last few weeks. 
CD: (laughs) We’ve had the books on the computer since the late eighties. 
VC: Now do you have the information on your individual animals on the computers too? 
ND: Yes. 
VC: Feeding plan for each of them and so forth. 
CD: Right, the boys- 
ND: We got that, well we used to have DHI, in fact he used to be on their board of directors for some 
time but um, we ended up buying our own meters and our own program and just doing the books on a- 
CD: Did it manually for quite a few years. And then once we got the computer, we started putting all the 
information on the computer, I wanna say the late eighties, early nineties. 
ND: Yup. All the cows are on- 
CD: Yeah, at one point we even did a genetic mating on all the animals. We have someone come in every 
year and evaluate all the cows and then that information was put in the computer and come back with a 
list of recommended bulls to breed to. So it’s uh, yeah computers have changed management of dairy 
farms. I can remember when we used to sit down and figure out a feeding program by hand. It would 
take you forty-five minutes to an hour to, you know once you got all the roughage information back, to 
sit down and manually figure what you needed to do and I mean now, uh the boys call it in on the com- 
send it in on the computer and you get the information back in a matter of minutes, hour at the most so, 
yup. 
0:20:34 
VC: Now is that part of your bookkeeping or are you doing more of the financial? 
ND: I did start it but I actually tried to through it in the lap of my son that milks and he did take it over 
because in order to be good with his particular job, he needed that familiarity. 
VC: Sure. 
ND: I can do it and he can do it. He does all the entries now. 
VC: So, feeding the calves. This is from the time they’re first weaned. 
ND: Well, from when they’re first born ‘til they’re- 
CD: First four or five milkings and then after that, it’d go on to, it depends, milk replacer, whole milk- 
ND: We had like four born this weekend. I did get to, I am in from the start yes. 
VC: So you’re going down every afternoon to feed calves. 
ND: Well, just morning and night, twice a day. And I used to be out at night to deliver the calves but now 
I can call Wade when it looks like a really big calf coming (laughs). You have a calf freshening over here 
instead of me going out to pull the calf, yes. 
VC: Handy to have him nearby. 
ND: It’s nice yes. 
CD: He might regret it. 
VC: So, uh, Clark is obviously very involved on the farm and the community as well with both- 
ND: Yes he is. 
VC: The dairy business and town business. Are you involved in the community too in different ways? 
0:22:22 
ND: I have tried to be, continue to be very active in the little church right here in West Stockholm. And 
other than that my world had shrunk to (laughs) the boundaries- 
CD: Of the farm. 
ND: of his folks and here. I take his mother, she goes to the doctors about once a week. When she’s in 
the hospital it’s me and I don’t regret that step back from the community to care for her, but I’m going 
to try to, at some point get involved again more. 
VC: Sure. Those are just transitional periods in our lives. We all, unfortunately are going to have to go 
through those. Um, okay, either one of you jump in on these but Clark, this is a particular question I 
think I was going to start with you on, that I had written out. You partially answered this before but I’d 
like to kind of have you think about it again. You went to Cornell and then you went into the banking 
business. 
CD: Correct. 
VC: What brought you back to the farm? 
CD: Well, I really enjoyed commercial lending, I enjoyed working with the farmers but um, I had a lot 
different perception of the farmers than what management, senior management of the bank does and it 
was at a time of very high interest rates and stuff like that and there was quite a lot of pressure to get 
involved with raising rates for the farmers and I knew what impact, I mean we were even at that point in 
time, margins were pretty narrow and so there was a lot of pressure on me to continue to generate 
income and at that same time we were, Nancy and I were getting engaged and the idea of raising a 
family and, with the responsibilities that were there at a commercial bank, it just became obvious that 
the farm was the place to be for raising a family. We just enjoyed every aspect of the farm and part of 
the aspect is of being a family, of being family oriented. Probably, um, there’s been a few times in the 
last few years when I’ve talked to, maintained a lot of friends who stayed in the commercial banking and 
as I listened to them telling about their retirement and (laughs) I kinda, sometimes grinning, but no no 
regrets. 
0:25:14 
VC: That’s good. You two however, unlike I think most of the farms that we have talked with, maybe all, 
any of the other farms we’ve talked with on this project have a long family history on the farm. 
CD: Yup. 
VC: A century farm. 
CD: Um, more. Hundred and, well 1849. 
ND: 164. 
VC: Right. 
ND: One hundred and sixty- four. 
CD: Yup. 
VC: Oh yeah, cause it was 150th here wasn’t it. 
ND: That was ‘99. 
CD: There was a reunion in ’99. So it’d be 160, 160 pretty near 165. 
VC: That’s a pretty long time. And your father of course had the farm. 
CD: Yup. 
VC: Did he, was he, did he go to Canton, Canton College? 
CD: He was a Canton College graduate, yup. Him and the neighbor Paul Kellum, who just passed away 
here a couple, about a month ago. Um, went, graduated from Potsdam High School and both went to 
Canton. 
ND: He studied dairy, right? 
CD: Farm Management, yup. 
ND: Farm. 
CD: Got all of his old textbooks upstairs (laughs). 
ND: Some of them are pretty practical for even today. (laughs) 
VC: So, he was probably knew Evan Dana. 
ND/CD: Yes, oh yes. 
CD: Real good friends.  
VC: When I first went to teach at Canton College, that’s, Mr. Dana was still there, you know. 
CD: Yeah, Dad thought the world of him. 
VC: So- 
CD: When he was at ATC, it was still over on the St. Lawrence campus. 
ND: The Kennedy- 
CD: And he went to- 
ND: Or wasn’t it down where Extension is, or no? 
CD: No, it was where, right there on the St. Lawrence campus. And he, used to go to hockey games and 
got real involved with St. Lawrence hockey and I was probably one of the very few St. Lawrence hockey 
fans that went to Potsdam High School (laughs). 
ND: When you went to Cornell, your, um views changed. 
VC: Decided which side of the rink to sit on. Um, so for bringing it up in the first place, um, was there, 
clearly there must have been a real sense of family pride in have maintained a farm like that through the 
generations. Was there also- 
CD: Pride and burden too. (laughs) 
VC:  Was there a sense of pressure too, to keep it-? 
CD: No, no my parents were very, I think they were very, matter of fact I bought the farm couple of 
years before I got done at the bank. Uh, simply because my dad was at the point where he was, didn’t 
want to do the, you know, I mean the taxes and all this were, were quite a burden so, I had owned the 
farm and operated it a couple years while I was still in the bank but uh, then I say it’s, they, they never 
pressured, they were surprised, I think they were kind of really surprised and I think they questioned me 
quite thoroughly when I got ready to leave the bank. They said they sold it to me thinking I was going to 
stay as a banker and operate this on the side. They really questioned whether I was, really wanted to 
leave the bank and come back. Similar to- 
ND: And I think, in the following through on that, our boys worked, Wade worked on a crop farm for a 
year after and Mark worked for an equipment repair business for a year and we actually had them be 
here on the farm for a couple more years before we really had them decided whether to go into the 
partnership or not. They needed to know- 
VC: What it takes. 
CD: You know I mean- 
ND: It was nothing, the longevity was a neat little, you know mode of interest but it was not the reason 
for any- 
CD: Motivating factor, no. We didn’t, you know, our whole objective in everything we had done over the 
years as far as buying additional land and stuff like this was with the idea that should the boys be 
interested, we would have a viable operation. Um, that would be able to support them. However, on the 
other hand, it would have been fairly simple to, the way it was set up, to have liquidated and moved on. 
But with their interests, I mean it is awful hard to say no.  
VC: Having said that, um, have you as a family, or as a couple or whatever, or with the boys developed 
what we call a business plan for the farm and looking forward, this sort of plan for it? 
CD: Yup, we have regular business meetings and, uh plan and projecting for the future. 
ND: We did for the NLLC with- 
CD: Yup, when we, so- 
VC: So do you sit down with a financial advisor or do you do that yourselves or how do you do that? 
CD: Um, we work with a bookkeeper that keeps all the recordkeeping and stuff. 
ND: Accountant. 
CD: Accountant. And we uh, review everything every year and go through it and summarize where we 
are and where we want to go. 
VC: I’m asking this because in our conversations with farmers, it’s just become such a business, you 
know it’s just such a business, it’s not, it’s not just in it for the love of animals anymore, you know. 
CD: No, no, and it’s the business aspect, you know. The people who weren’t good business organizers 
and managers aren’t farming anymore. 
ND: No, I had, we had an accountant retire and we just were searching around for another one and we 
tried a different fellow one year and I came in and he said farmers aren’t good businessmen and I was 
like well, I think in order to stay farming you have to be- 
CD: Pretty good bus- 
ND: Otherwise you’re, you’re not going to be in business. 
VC: That’s right, yeah. And I think that’s, the implications of what you’re saying is that some farmers are 
not good businessmen, which- 
CD: Well- 
VC: Maybe he was- 
CD: And I say those people aren’t farming anymore. 
VC: Right. 
ND: We decided not to stay with that particular accountant. (laughs) 
CD: Year or two and that was it. We moved on. 
VC:  One of the things that’s been our observation in these conversations, is that for our less, especially 
for the big operations, the much bigger operations is a lot, this is really about productivity. It’s really 
about productivity, do you feel that too? 
CD: Oh yes, yes probably even more so than they do because we don’t have the units to, uh add up to, 
with an incremental for each unit, we have fewer units to add up to for a total profit. So, I think it’s 
probably, maybe even greater pressure than what they face. 
ND: We had a boy working here for us, I think it was last year and we were really studying commodities 
because we had enough corn where we would be able to sell some, and he was just amaz- he had no 
idea what farming is like now. It is like a day by day, tracking commodities and, well, because we buy it 
for the feed in the bins, just kind of track how much, how much to we buy of this and when. 
CD: Yeah, the average, average person going up and down the street hasn’t got a clue. 
VC: Well, I think I had said it to you before Clark, one of the things, it didn’t surprise me because of 
ability, it just surprised me because of the nature of the change over my own lifetime here in the North 
Country, how many farmers, in particular, successful farmers are college graduates now. I mean, I know 
obviously Cornell, or an agriculture background makes a lot of sense, um well I think a lot of the people 
we talked to like you have had that kind of background. So it’s, it’s, that’s so different now. Something 
you just referred to reminds me to ask the question. What, now this may take a few minutes, what sort 
of, are the tasks on the farm, month by month, or better say season by season? When do you, do you 
figure this at the beginning of the year or does it just keep going? 
0:33:56 
CD: Tops and flow, yeah. There’s more seasonality now that I’m not involved, I mean when you milk 
twice a day, every day, it’s a lot more continuous. Now with not being involved so much in the day to 
day, right there at the, milking aspect, there’s more seasonality, you know. I spent the fall and early 
winter in the woods, uh, logs and firewood and thinning, you know, maintaining the roads and that and 
then start the first of February, everything is sugaring pretty much from the first of February to the first 
of May or so, it’s all sugaring and then the planting season and then the harvest start with hay and stuff 
so. 
VC: So, when does planting season start here? 
CD: About the first of May. Take and, although I used to say I’d clean my pick-up out at the end of 
sugaring but now still maintaining lines year round so, very seldom does my pick-up get cleaned out. But 
uh, we, when we get a rainy spell and can’t chop I’m in the woods walking lines and not for a few days 
yet but, I’ve got a kid that’s working with me that’s been in walking lines and stuff so. 
VC: Tubing lines, right? 
CD: Right. A lot of wind this summer, a lot of limbs down, so he’s been maintaining them while I 
couldn’t. But yeah, there’s, I say I have more seasonality now probably than the boys do because I kinda 
get to shift hats as we go through the year whereas before it was just more of a continuous flow. 
VC: So for crops, you plant, how much crops does your farm plant? 
CD: Well, we, right now it’s primarily corn and then alfalfa and alfalfa grass mixtures. For several years 
we grew soy beans but we’ve kind of moved away from those and just concentrating on the corn and 
the profitability of corn, we’ve concentrated more on the corn aspect. We raise corn for silage, corn for 
the snaplage we use for our own and then we- 
VC: And what is that again, snap- 
CD: Snaplage, where we just take the ear and grind it, and take it and store it in a bag. And then we also 
have Bordoes come in and combine shell corn. Some which, sometimes we store and use or there again, 
depending on the market we may end up selling some of it. 
VC: This is your observation about the commodities earlier. 
ND: Right, the corn is price per bushel. 
CD: Ten years ago, I didn’t know what commodities were. I took a commodities course when I was at 
Cornell and kind of put, that kind of slipped away but- 
VC: That’s pork bellies were- 
CD: Yup. Buying pork bellies, paid a lot of money on paper when I was in class. But it’s an aspect of the 
farm today that you’ve really got to keep up on, tracked all the time. 
0:37:31 
VC: So the boys are doing this now. The planting and the- 
CD: Yeah, I’ve worked with them most all the time during the planting and maybe not actually running 
the planter so much as I used to, is logistics, moving and getting things ordered, getting deliveries here 
in time, moving this ahead so when they get to a field things are ready to go so. 
VC: I noticed driving up your road, which is a beautiful road this time of year, you know maybe, it looks 
to be a brand new cutting, hay there, is that like the second? Second. 
CD: Yup. 
VC: Do you do more than two? 
CD: Yup, we’ll be, next week probably starting third so. We’ve been through, this is just some of the last 
their baling for beefers and calves and heifers. 
ND: I can remember my sister one time asking me when we’d be done haying and I was like November. 
(laughs, phone rings) 
CD: Always keep going. 
VC: You want me to pause this, okay she’s going to take this. So, um, so there are, of course seasonal 
and even monthly kinds of things going on but you yourself are personally more removed from those 
now is that what you were saying? 
CD: Right, yeah. I, uh, and I say I enjoy the work that I do at the town and it’s uh, I probably put in 15, 16 
hours a week there at, in the office and another 6-8 hours here on the computer, just keeping things up, 
you know it’s just, the town, the town government is getting to be a tight, tight situation. 
VC: Meaning? 
CD: Uh, working on budget right now, it’s the, you know we’ve held the line for years on taxes. 
Stockholm’s got one of the lowest tax rates around but, now all of a sudden we’re looking at 5-10% 
increase in taxes, just costs, 10 years ago they weren’t paying anything for state retirement. In 2008, we 
paid about $30,000 towards state retirement. 2014 they are estimating $80,000. Health insurance, I 
mean it’s up to $100,000 for health insurance for the six employees at the town and uh, you start, once 
it gets to that level you start talking 15% increase, you’re looking. And maintenance on the highway 
department, you know it’s just, everything is just exponentially increasing. 
VC: Yeah, and the more, and obviously you’re trying to keep it as under control as possible, but that just 
takes a lot more time, conversations and such. Trying to keep people happy, talking about the town 
budget. 
ND: Oh yeah. 
0:40:45 
VC: Okay, let’s see, um, we talked a little bit about earlier when I first came in about maple. Is that, 
that’s become a pretty good source of- 
CD: Supplemental income. 
VC: Supplemental income.  
CD: Yup, and I’m not a real strong advocate for some of the things that are going on on the state level. I 
mean, it appears to me that the, right now with New York State you can apply and get grants to put big 
ROs and these new more efficient evaporators and stuff like this, I mean the-, Cornell and the 
Department of Agriculture are pushing producers to go from 500 to 5,000 and from 5,000 to 50,000. 
And it reminds me of the state we were in with the dairy market back in the late 70s and early 80s, 
where they were pushing for expansion and pushing for, you know, modernizing and then more 
efficiencies and stuff like this. And what we ran into with the increased production, you didn’t see a 
whole lot of increase in profitability, you know, expenses rose as fast as income and, uh right now with 
the situation with maple, there is a potential on a good year with the cooperation of the weather, you 
can actually generate a little income. If a lot of these big producers come on and world market supply 
increases, price drops, you wonder what the potential is. 
VC: Doesn’t make it worth it to you, yeah I understand that, sure. It’s the, and some of it, I have a friend 
actually who lives in Litchfield, CT but he grew up in Watertown and his grandparents lived in 
Hopkinton. So when we were kids, he would come for the summer and he’s gone on and he’s had a very 
successful career in corporate business. He worked for Kraft Foods, but his, he has this hobby with 
maple. In fact he’s on the, I don’t know, the board of the maple museum over in Croghan, he travels all 
over, you may even know him, Mark Harren. 
CD: I’ve heard the name. 
VC: I just was on the phone with him, ‘cause he’s coming up to visit. His family is buried over, his parents 
over in Hop- grandparents over in Hopkinton. So ,uh, but anyway we went to visit him in Litchfield, and 
he’s got a beautiful old farm house, this is very tony pricey community over in western Connecticut. 
Where you and I would just be visiting but anyway. But anyway he’s got this maple operation, it’s not 
big, it’s totally energy efficient, I mean it’s unbelievable. It’s a room this size, it has this one, the 
evaporators is tiny but it produces all kinds, I mean it has the potential t for- 
CD: Yup, ROs. 
VC: Is that what it’s called? RO stands for? 
CD: Reverse Osmosis Machines. 
VC: Okay. 
CD: You run it through and concentrate it. Yeah, there’s people, I mean we have 3,000 taps and we have 
a 5x14 evaporator with a steam away. There’s people who have 3,000 taps and run a 2x8 or 2½x8 
evaporator. But they run it through the ROs until they concentrate it up to about 10% so. They don’t, 
they only run about a quarter the amount of sap through, but the price of new evaporators. If you had 
to go and buy- 
VC: Well, that’s exactly what you were saying a few minutes ago as far as dairy, the equipment becomes 
so expensive that you really have to be big in order, first of all to buy it and in order to maintain it. So 
that’s not an encouraging thing. But, so you have about 3,000 taps and on a good year, I don’t think this 
year was a particularly good year. 
CD: This, this, yeah, we made the most syrup we’ve ever made. Not the most sap per tap but we’ve gone 
to buying some sap from neighbors and they want to eventually get involved but they find that by selling 
the sap for a couple of years, it gives them some money to invest in getting started. 
VC: So how much syrup did you make? 
CD: Uh, 910 gallons.  
VC: So you are big time. You’re one of the bigger maple producers around then. 
CD: Well no, Charlie Rutley’s right down here in Sanfordville with 30,000 taps so. Rutley Farms. 
VC: Really, so does he sell locally at all? 
CD: Very little, he sells out of his sugar house but mostly wholesales. 
VC: So you sell different grades of it to different places. 
CD: Right.  
VC: So even like the darker stuff? 
CD: We keep some of the darker to make granulated maple sugar. But we, most of the syrup that we jug 
and sell locally is all medium, medium amber. Uh, we keep some of the fancier light amber that we use 
to make maple cream and maple candies. 
VC: Oh you do. 
0:46:16 
CD: So- 
VC: That’s interesting, but that’s less, is it more sugar content, the fancy. 
CD: Less. 
VC: Less. So, it takes more of it. 
CD: Right, but you get more of a, the, we’ve made some with medium, made some candies with medium 
and they were almost too sweet.  
VC: Oh, interesting. One of the things, interesting, one of the observations I’ve made over the years is 
that it seems the more urban want darker syrup, is that true? 
CD: We’ve always had a- 
ND: Depends on how you label it. 
CD: And how you grade it too. We’ve always had a fairly strong demand for medium.  
ND: The older generation, if they came to the sugar house, they were always hoping we had some dark 
syrup for them. 
VC: Did they? 
CD: Because a lot of the times when they were growing up, it was more of what they- 
ND: More of their memories. 
CD: But now you see at L.L. Bean you can buy a quart of dark amber for $28 or something. 
VC: Exactly. 
ND: But the fancy restaurants know that the lighter is more or what they consider a gourmet. 
 CD: But the restaurants, all the stuff we sell to restaurants is all medium.  
VC: Are there a number of restaurants that, in, is this in Lake Placid? 
CD: Right. 
VC: That are actually using real maple syrup. Are they calling it Adirondack maple syrup? 
CD: Could be. I guess we’re on the border of the Adirondacks. 
VC: I never really thought there was much maple syrup being made in- 
CD: There is a place in Lake Placid that makes it, they’re supplying a few and a couple of the restaurants 
where we’re taking in granulated maple sugar and maple cream and candies is buying this syrup from 
this other producer. 
VC: Uline probably isn’t it? 
CD: No, that’s the research, that’s Cornell, there is an independent, and I can’t think of his name right 
now, but he has a real nice operation up there in Lake Placid. It was a person that made a business 
fortune someplace else and came back to the- 
VC: Into the maple syrup. 
CD: Invested it in maple. 
VC: Like my friend that I was telling you about. 
CD: Yeah the same. 
0:48:21 
VC: Same idea. So, you, move on because I know we need to get moving on here, the division of labor is 
pretty well spelled out in the things we talked about earlier, what you do, your sons. Sons divided the 
labor up too or? 
CD: As far as the farm yeah, Mark does most of the milking and breeding, Wade does most of the crop 
work and planting, he also mixes and feeds so it’s- 
ND: Mark does the mechanical and- 
CD: Yup, but they, it’s kind of just evolved, there was nothing where we sat down and said today you’re, 
and the other thing on weekends they each take a day off and they switch so that they’re constantly 
kept up to date on what’s- 
VC: The other person. 
CD: Wade milks on Sunday so that he can, if something were to happen he could step in and Mark mixes 
and stuff so that they’re covered. 
0:49:27 
VC: Major changes over the years, even, well you acquired the farm? 
CD: Right. 
VC: What have been the major changes that you recall? 
CD: Well, when I bought the farm it was 33 cows, uh, there were, we were very involved in pure bred 
guarantees, did a lot of showing at the St. Lawrence, Franklin and State Fair. So, the year that I bought 
the farm we expanded, added on and expanded, went to 60 cows here and then I leased another 
operation so that we were up, milking over a hundred that very first year. That was in ’77, in ’78 we got 
married, that was quite a change, ’79- 
ND: You got that right. (laughs) 
CD: ’79 we bought, I got out of the lease we were in and bought our second farm up on MacIntire Road 
and then put a herd on there so we were, we stayed still about a hundred cows. Then in ’86 we bought, 
added onto this end of the barn and brought it up to about a hundred cows here and bought the old 
Wells farm so we were put on about a herd of 40 there so we were up about 180 at that time. So, that 
was probably the peak and you know you could hire, we had men that working for $75 or $100 a week 
at that time and were real pleased and did real well. Buy a new car and have a pick-up and a 
snowmobile. But as we moved into the ‘90s it just came to a point where it wasn’t sustainable to keep 
three operations going so we ended up consolidating everything here at the home farm. Ended up 
milking around 110, 120 cows. Then, as we moved forward and the boys looked more interested in 
coming back, probably the next major change was in 2000 we started the free stall barn. In 2002, we 
added the milking parlor and then 2006, I think it was, we, 2007, we added the addition onto the free 
stall barn. It’s been a gradual evolution. 
ND: There are a lot of things that I look at him and think, my goodness if his father, would never have 
dreamed. The computerized world is a big deal now. To go from milking in the hand milking, to the 
parlor, the labor saving- 
CD: Yeah, when I was a kid, dad had two milking machines and I would milk by hand so to speed it up I 
would go through some of the tail enders and stuff. I’d milk half a dozen to a dozen by hand while he 
was milking the other two, cause I also wanted to get out and get the crops going (laughs). 
VC: Yeah, so, one of the other farmers said that vaccinations have been a big deal. Is that, would you 
agree with that? 
CD: Oh yeah, it’s evolved. I mean when I first started farming all you did was vaccinated for shipping 
fever every fall and that was it. Now the boys have a whole check list that they go through with every 
animal. When they’re dried off and when they freshen, all the vaccinations that are done is just amazing. 
Yup, the evolution. 
VC: And how about the changing nature of equipment. Is it, that had an impact for you? 
CD: Uh, it’s impacted us but probably not to the extent that the larger operations. We, you know, now, 
when I first started farming, when I bought the equipment from our, my father and leased the other 
farm, the largest tractor was a 45 horse tractor. The last one the boys bought was 240 horse so, um 
yeah, for years we used the 12 foot wheel harrows and now we’re using 22s. 
ND: Well, and I think when we were first married, I was picking the hay up off the ground and putting it 
on a wagon- 
CD: Yup and it’s, when we first started farming we were putting up 25, 30 thou- when we were running 
the three operations, we were putting up around 30,000 bales of hay. 
ND: And now they bag instead of the silos, are almost obsolete. 
CD: And now we use, they bale 3-5 thousand bales of hay. 
0:54:41 
VC: Do you have a bunker silo? 
CD: No, no all bags. 
VC: All bags. Interesting, and that’s cost efficient? 
CD: It’s more costly to put it up than it is in a bunker but with the small herd, it’s a lot less spoilage. We 
have used the bunker in the past, have one just in between the two farms here and ran into a problem 
with being able to maintain a space especially during the summer months, without molding and 
spoilage. 
VC: When we talked before, if I remember correct, I think you mentioned some like hundred day 
varieties of crops, does that sound familiar? 
CD: Right, yup corn varieties. 
VC: Are they hybrid? 
CD: Yes, everything is hybrids. A lot of it is genetically, well this year I think it’s all genetically modified. 
VC: And GMOs- 
CD: Genetically Modified, yup. 
VC: That’s what you’re talking about now. 
CD: Probably the greatest thing that happened to dairy farmers in Northern New York is the advent of 
the Roundup resistant corn varieties. For the benefit of the environment as well as the health of the 
farmers. When I first started farming, some of the chemicals that we were using scare the living hell 
right out of me now. We didn’t have any concept of- 
ND: Oh his father, I, he, you think my gosh they used that back then and they didn’t think a thing about 
it. Finally finding, it almost like they moved ahead too fast so they didn’t really have a chance to study- 
VC: the effects. 
CD: A lot of, well the atrozine and all I can think of glomazone, what it was called before that but, you 
could be overcome with the fumes but it was nasty stuff. Roundup now, I mean people buy it and spray 
it on the side of their, their sidewalk and around their flowerbeds and I mean that’s the same intensity 
and same material that we’re using on corn so. A lot better for the environment and a hell of a lot better 
for the people who are using it. 
0:57:17 
VC: Sure, sure. Now of course there’s, as we all know there’s a certain amount of controversy about 
everything in this life, there’s controversy about crop technology and stuff. Is that a consideration for 
you, is that some of the things you’re referring to or-? 
CD: No, it’s a no-brainer as far as I’m concerned.  
ND: I think there’s a lot more regulation going on now than there was when it was first- 
CD: proposed. 
ND: First steps of these. You know like you’re father’s generation. I think the regulations just weren’t in 
place yet but- 
CD: I, a neighbor, my dad and a neighbor on the farm I ended up leasing in ‘77, used to share a sprayer 
back and forth and I can remember my neighbor reaching, you know pouring the atrocine into the tank, 
then reaching down with his hand and stirring that stuff up. Grab a hold of a clump and bring it up and 
you know, wring it out between his fingers, scare the hell out of you today though. So, so, I’m sure there 
are people that have concerns and maybe in their eyes, in their view they have something to be 
concerned about but boy as far as from my perspective and what I’ve seen in the past, I mean, we’re 
light years ahead of where we were. And it’s, like I said- 
ND: And with these concentrated, the nutrient management plans that they have, we, he keeps that up 
to date. Where you have a crop consultant- 
CD: that works with us, yup, that comes up with a cropping program-  
ND: make sure you aren’t-- 
VC: Do you drink your own milk? 
ND: Kids grew up on it. 
CD: Yeah I don’t so much now simply because all the- 
ND: too much fat. 
CD: yup. 
ND: the butter fat is close to four. 
CD: Yeah they wanted me on the skim but I, most I could do is 1%. 
VC: I, I can’t take skim. It’s like dish water. (laughs) 
ND: We grew up on it. 
CD: Yeah, we’ve always drank all our own milk. 
VC: Do you still? 
CD: I don’t but- 
VC: but the boys do? 
CD: Yeah. 
VC: ‘Cause you know some of these big farms don’t, they say they can’t get to it. 
CD: Oh I can imagine. 
VC: They say they can’t get to it. It’s in those big tanks. 
CD: Yeah, yeah, it’s probably justified. 
VC: Isn’t that strange. 
CD: You’d have to have a ladder to- 
ND: But that, that again, everyday our milk is sampled at the plant, we get a print out. We know how, if 
the bacteria were to be high, you know like a compressor went one day and the bacteria- 
CD: Spiked. 
ND: Well they have different, it was still safe but, you know everyday what the butter fat, protein, what 
the solids are. And all I got to do it go to the computer and check it and I how how it’s- 
CD: And Marcus is watching it all the time for the, muns and stuff like that so that, in case there is a 
drastic change in the feed, they can check when they altered the feeding program, checking to make 
sure everything has stayed in line. Stuff that never would have dream- 
ND: His father, just sort of takes the fun out of it, some of that to but (laughs), it’s a good thing. 
1:00:49 
VC: So used, have you used in your, over the years, Nancy, have you used a, made butter or made 
cheese or that kind of thing? 
ND: That time of the ice storm, they couldn’t come and get the milk and we did end up skimming the 
cream off before we ran it out- 
CD: Dumped the rest. 
ND: And made butter, yup. With, actually with his mother’s involvement in that. 
VC: ‘Cause there are, I’m not sure there are many people left old enough- 
ND: Yeah I used to do the heavy, the heavy cooked cream- 
VC: To make cottage cheese and those kinds of things- 
CD: Yup, I can remember as a kid, every now, see my dad put a tank in in about ’64 and when we first 
started there, every now and then somebody would forget to turn the tank on and I can remember my 
mom going out a skimming the sour cream off and making sour cream bars and stuff like that (laughs) 
and doing everything you could to, capitalize. 
VC: Sure, sure. 
ND: Yeah, we used to sell, and we don’t anymore but back when we first started there were people who 
would come and want to make their own yogurt, would come and buy the milk from right out of the 
tank. 
CD:  Yeah we had several- 
ND: Now you can’t do that. You can’t sell it. 
CD: Well I guess if they want to come and buy it, we’ve had a couple people that have asked about it and 
they’ve come and, just too much of a hassle. 
ND: We sort of discourage it, yeah, it’s just not- 
VC: Well you don’t want to be held responsible, well for one thing. So do you think, you mentioned, 
Nancy, regulations, are regulations a good thing? 
CD: You’ve got to have them today. I mean with the market the way it is, the concern that there is for, 
you know, the public and the way they keep track of what’s going on. And it’s going to be even more so I 
think here in the future so. 
ND: Yeah, it’s good. 
VC: Okay, just a few more questions. What’s the average production per cow, do you have any idea? 
CD: Last time that Mark and I were looking at it, it was around 23-5, 23,500. 
VC: Per year. 
CD: Per cow per year, yeah. 
VC: Per cow per year. Is that average? Good? Above average? 
CD: It’s continued to escalate. I mean, I would imagine, I don’t haven’t even, you know- 
ND: We used to be on DHI, but I think probably some of these larger farms are able to get a higher 
production per cow. 
VC: DHI meaning: 
CD: Dairy Herd Improvement Association. 
VC: Okay, DHI. 
CD: We, this is just all calculated on, when we weigh every month so. Their pretty, they keep it very- 
ND: Yeah, cause the tank weight matches the other, yeah. 
VC: Sure, sure. What’s your favorite job on the farm? (laughs) Or do you even have one? 
CD: Raising grandchildren. (laughs) 
VC: Or do you have one? Put you on the spot. 
CD: Well mine is, I really enjoy planting corn. I mean, I’ve always enjoyed the crop work. Probably to the 
point where we could have been a little better off if we concentrated a little more on the herd but, at 
the time when we started farming, the most important thing you could do for maintaining production 
was to have good quality crops. And then on the other hand you’d have the dairy herd person who was 
saying well in order to maintain maximum production you have to concentrate all your time on 
maintaining the herd. And I think this is where some of the larger farms have a little advantage. I mean, 
you can have a herdsman who concentrates entirely on the cow aspect and you can have a crop person 
who concentrates, but at the time when we were right in our heyday, why you wore both hats and 
balanced things accordingly. 
ND: But and I also think that that is an advantage of having a smaller farm is that our boys know how to 
do everything, on the farm, but specializing is good but I think it’s also good to know how to do 
everything. And as far as my favorite, I thoroughly enjoy being with grandchildren, but I don’t consider it 
a job, I guess. (laughs) So as far as the farm job, I like working, I like being at the computer and working 
on the books. 
1:05:36 
VC: So do you have a least favorite? 
CD: Feeding calves. (laughs)  
ND: It’s beginning, it’s beginning to be ready for a replacement on the calf care. But I do still, I don’t, I 
don’t mind doing it but- 
VC: Not your first choice. 
CD: There comes a time. 
VC: Do you have a least favorite Clark? 
CD: Oh… 
VC: ‘Cause we all have those on our jobs. 
CD: It was, I mean I enjoyed every aspect of it. You know the years that I was involved in day to day, um I 
don’t know- 
ND: You don’t like book work. 
CD: Well, you’re right. (laughs) 
VC: So you became Town Supervisor. 
CD: Well, no, but I mean as far as, yeah, that probably was the day that Nancy stepped up and started 
taking over the check book probably was the best thing to happen for our books. 
VC: I understand that from my own household. 
CD: We used to use the Cornell Cash Account Book and uh, 
ND: Yeah. 
CD: had a heck of a time balancing, you know, I figured if I got within $10, I was close enough. Nancy was 
off two cents she’d sit here for hours trying to find- 
VC: A lot of late nights. (laughs) 
1:06:56 
VC: Is there a most challenging part to the farm work for either of you? 
CD: Just keeping up, you know. 
ND: Yeah, just- 
CD: I mean when- 
ND: The financial aspect. 
CD: When we were, you know, involved, when I was involved in the day to day, it was probably a little 
easier to keep but now with the outside interests and stuff, it’s a challenge to keep up with the modern 
technologies. 
ND: Yeah I don’t know, his father used to say, the difference between you and me is the number of 
zeroes but as I got, I think it was a different multiplier as it went through the years. Maybe at the time 
he said that it was but now. One of his old income tax returns I found, he had been getting $5, 100 for 
his milk and seed purchases for that year was $200. A bag of corn seed now this year, $200 you can 
spend $280. 
CD: Well we averaged $289 for a bag of corn seed. 
ND: And we’re not- 
VC: And how big of a bag? 
ND: And that’s not a number that you- 
CD: 8,000 kernels. It’s not even a full bushel anymore. They count the kernels. 
VC: Really? (laughs) 
CD: So, yeah it’s I really think that the time when my parents were involved in farming, they enjoyed it a 
lot more. 
ND: They had a lot of social time, evenings- 
CD: They, yup, we’re involved in 4-H, involved in FFA, they had time to spend, you know, I guess I told 
you before, you know, I can remember getting up at 3:30 and milking and getting in the car and driving, 
spending the day at the State Fair. All of us coming home and going out and doing chores and getting in 
at 9:30 or so at night. And you didn’t worry about it. I mean you might have lost fifteen pounds of 
production, but so what? 
VC: That was the price of going to the fair. 
CD: But you got to spend the day at the State Fair. Now- 
VC: Just isn’t time for that kind of thing now. 
CD: It’s just impossible, you know. 
ND: They would have friends over at night and it was wonderful, pies and cards and- 
VC: You just don’t see that now. 
CD: You crawl in at night now and you just get to the chair and collapse. It’s a lot more intense than it 
ever was when I was a kid, you know. The intensity is just, and it’s every aspect is just so micromanaged 
compared to what it was then. Um, I mean, you didn’t, we’ve talked about chemicals, my dad never 
knew what a license was and now I have to, when we first started licensing to handle pesticides, there 
were so many farmers they had all kinds of meeting where you could go and maintain your credits and 
stuff like that but now you have to hunt and peck to find enough to maintain the credits that you need 
to keep certified. And I say, it’s just one area after another that just keeps requiring a much more 
intense management. You talked about vaccinations, I mean, that’s something when we were, the vet 
came in fall and we vaccinated the cows and that was it, shipping fever and IBR and Blackfoot or 
something like that. Now it’s another whole management program that you have to maintain. So, it’s, I 
say it’s a whole different world, it’s evolved amazingly over thirty-five years. 
ND: And they’re tested so, and another example of something that’s for the, of course when a newborn 
calf is born you feed the mother’s colostrum to the calf, well if you dry treat your cows at the end of 
their lactation so they don’t freshen with mastitis, they have that dry cow treatment. Well now they’re 
testing the calves at the sale so if you feed a bull calf the colostrum from the mother that was dry 
treated, then you can’t have him go to the sale until that has been flushed through his system, the 
colostrum so even little things, like I have to keep track of, (phone ringing) I have to feed heifer milk to 
certain calves or it’s just more complicated. And it’s a good thing. 
VC: Do you need to get that? 
CD: No, it’s mine. 
ND: It’s his. 
CD: I’ve got voicemail. 
VC: Okay. Interesting, that’s very interesting. Um, couple of other things here. The, does the farm, what 
role do you think the farm, in Northern New York, or in St. Lawrence County, or in your part of St. 
Lawrence County, whatever you choose, the role of the farm in the larger community, is it as, is it like it 
was before, how would you assess it, the role of the farm? 
1:11:59 
CD: I, one advantage of our size is that I think we have a better perception by the neighbors and 
community than some of the larger operations. I think there’s more of a tendency to look at a two 
hundred cow farm as a family operation when the ones that are milking 700 or 1200, even though it is 
entirely a family operation, it’s viewed more as a business or corporate operation or something like this. 
We have people that we lease land from that only lease it to us because we are a small family operation. 
They know me on a personal basis, I take them maple, I take them syrup and candies and stuff like that. 
We don’t pay a great deal of rent but if some of the large operations come in looking at the land, they 
won’t have anything to do with them. They don’t want to be involved with this corporate, so they call, 
corporate farms. I think that our size operation does have a few advantages in that aspect. Other 
neighbors that we have have been approached by some of the larger operations to lease their land to 
them and they just simply say, as long as the Deckers are operating, why we’re going to work with them. 
I try to take the time to maintain a personal, I stop in and talk and stuff like this where some of the 
larger operations would rather just cut them a check. And these, a lot of these people are older, people 
that own land and they was to discuss what I’m going to grow and they want to discuss, and they may 
only want corn in that field for a couple years. We can accommodate that. 
ND: Yeah and I think knowing that, if they are in trouble they can come to use for help. Like how many 
people go off in the ditch in the winter and there they are, can you pull us out. 
CD: We’ve got the person that we use- 
ND: They know us enough to be comfortable. 
CD: A guy that we use his land and he bought a little tractor and was back in the woods and got stuck 
and called and said, I’d hate to bother you, and I mean it was three miles for us to take a tractor up and 
so we went up, we got him, we pulled him out and came back and we hadn’t anymore than got back 
here and he called again and said you aren’t going to believe this, I’m stuck again. So, you know we 
turned around and went back up and pulled him out again. That I think is one of our advantages, you 
know with this size operation, we’re able to be a little more personal and accommodating than, uh the 
large operations, you know, they aren’t going to have time to send somebody out with a tractor to pull 
somebody out with a tractor. 
1:15:14 
VC: Right, right. One last question for both of you, as far as I know, and then if you have something you 
want to add. What are you most proud of, particularly related to the farm and I know you’re proud of 
grandchildren and- 
ND: Well, the children.  
CD: The boys. 
ND: I-I do think our children are definitely the pride of our lives. 
CD: Not, not only, you know the boys here but our two daughters. One that works for the Soil and Water 
is renowned throughout the state for her abilities for balancing budgets and working, complying with 
state regulations and stuff like this. She graduated from, with a four year degree from Cobleskill in three 
years and so. 
ND: She was the top ag student. 
CD: Top, had the highest cumulative grade of anybody who had graduated from ag and economics. And 
then our younger daughter has developed a reputation here in the North Country for her abilities. She 
worked for Soil and Water a year ago and they still call her with questions about plant identification and 
stuff like that. 
ND: Yup, she gets more pictures sent to her, what is this? 
CD: And she has developed a very good rapport down there at Fort Drum and has worked with the, not 
only with the Land Management division that she’s in but with the foresters  and stuff are real anxious 
to work with her and have her help them. She helped with the maple sugaring and developing the maple 
project there at Fort Drum as well. Yup, our children have all been, we are proud of the boys for their 
interest and desire to come back and maintain the operation but we got a lot of respect for the girls too. 
They still, like Crystal was up this weekend and helped me with the, helped Nancy and I with making the 
maple candies and maple cream and stuff like that. Rayann, if Nancy’s out with mom at the hospital, 
Rayann will come over and help feed calves and stuff. So, I mean it’s a very interwoven family operation 
and we’re really proud of what the kids have done. 
VC: Anything to add, Nancy? 
ND: Nope that is (laughs) my answer too. 
VC: Do you have, now I think that was a wonderful answer. As far as the farm itself goes though, over 
the years or currently? 
CD: Well just surviving. (laughs) 
VC: Really. 
CD: One hundred and sixty-four years. 
VC: Yeah really. 
CD: Well, I say it’s a, we’ve been adaptable. You know you start, my goal was to be at 200 cows in five 
years when I started and we got pretty close to it and then I had some respiratory problems with, and 
with the farmer’s lung disease and that was about the time when economics of agriculture were 
changing. We looked, didn’t really want to do it but we ended up consolidating and refocusing and 
worked here just keeping things going and then gradually, when I got through that, got my health back, 
then we started gradual expansion and moving back up and then with the boys coming back, we’ve 
continued and I say will be back at the 200 cow level here within a year or so. It’s just a case of take, 
taking the lemons and making the lemonade. 
VC: Well I can’t thank you both enough, really for doing this with us. I think it’s, this has been a huge 
learning exp- I mean I grew up, not on a farm but with farmers around me you know and uh, but also 
just because of the changes that have occurred within the last fifty years. 
CD/ND: Amazing. 
VC: Amazing things that are happening on farms. And so it’s been a real learning experience for us at 
TAUNY and it’s something I think when we hear from other people we’ve started sending some of our 
reports around the country, they’re just really amazed at the information we’ve gathered. Okay I’m 
going to turn this off and I am going to ask one thing.
