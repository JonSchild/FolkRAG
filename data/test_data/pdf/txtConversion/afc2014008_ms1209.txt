Both  Guam  and  Saipan  are  territories  with  political  affiliation
 
with  the  USA.
 Guam  is  considered  a territory  of  the US.
 Saipan,
 
Rota,  and  Tinian  are  the maj or  isl ands  of  the Commonwealth of  the
 
Northern Mariana  (CNMI)  or Mariana Province.
 Since the  late 1980' o
 
both  of  these  island  territories  have  experienced  maj or  growth  in
 
their  tourist  and
 travel
 rel ated  industries.
 This  growth  has
 
resul ted  in  infrastructure  improvements  to the area of  the isl ands
 
that  serve  the  tourist.
 In  contrast  the  areas  of  both  isl and
 
territori es  that  do  not  cater  to  the  tourism  boom  receive  less
 
attention.
 As  a  result  of  the  decline  of  the  eighties  boom  in
 
Japan,  other  Asia  countries  and  the  United  States  the  islands  are
 
now experiencing  a decrease  in  economic  growth.
 However,  tourism
 
and  rel ated  businesses  are  still  the  maj or  empl oyers  and  sources
 
of  income.
 
The  two  isl and  territories  have  a weal th  of  traditional  arts  and
 
rich
 cultural
 heritages
 in
 both
 the
 Chamorro
 and
 Carolinian
 
communities.
 This  is  al s o  t r u e  o f  the other  immigrant communities
 
which now call  these  isl ands  home,  such as  the Philippine,  Korean,
 
Japanese,  Chinese,  and  mainl and  and  locall y  born  Americans.
 This
 
cultural  diversity  on  both  isl ands  makes  them  potential  crucibl es
 
for  the  growth  and  preservati on  of  equall y  diverse  performing,
 
visual,  and  literary  traditional  arts.

Contact  Person:  Sandy  McKenzie,  CCAC  Deputy  Executive  Director
 
I arrived  on  Saipan  on  the  afternoon  J a n u a r y
 19th  after  the  two
 
flights necessary  for  the  trip  from Yap  in  the FSM.
 I was greeted
 
at  the  airport  first  in  the  baggage  and  customs  area  by  an  agent
 
and  his canine  and  given  a thorough once over  by  an  educated nose.
 
The  CCAC  deputy  director  Sandy  McKenzie  w a s
 there  to  pick  me  up
 
and  assist  in  finding  a hotel  to  stay  in  for  the  night.
 The  face
 
of  the  island  had  noticeabl y  changed  since  I left  in  1990.
 There
 
were  traffic  lights  and  middl e  road  was  now  a four  lane  road  with
 
turning  lanes and a MacDonalds,  an ominous sign.
 The gubernatorial
 
inauguration  hand  taken  pl ace  the  previous  week  making  Froil an  C.
 
I
 
Tenoria  the  new  Governor.
 I was  informed  that  staff  at  the  CCAC
 
were pensive about  possible changes due  to the new administration.
 
The  evening  of  the  19th  I surveyed  a bit  of  the  commercial  areas
 
along  Beach  Rd.  and  Middl e  Rd.  on  my  way  to  dinner.
 There  were
 
sign  of  the  tourist  related  growth  I spoke about  and  a noticeable
 
increase  in  resident  mainland  Americans.
 The  architecture  along
 
both roads has  increased.
 The roads  to  the north are still  in the
 
process  of  being  resurfaced  and  there  is  a jogging  trail  around
 
American  Memorial  Park  and  the Marina  area  in  Garapan.
 
I spoke with Sandy McKenzie over  breakfast  about  the  future  plans
 
of  the  CCAC.
 The  subj ect  of  the
 grant  application  from  Inetnon
 
Manako'  Luta  the  group  from  Rota.  Evidently  the  application  was
 
submitted  to  the  NEA  Folk  Arts  program  without  any  consultation
 
with  the  CCAC  staff  on  Saipan  and  was  very  premature  to  say  the
 
least.
 One  memoer  of  the  group  Richard  Mangiona  was  the  CCAC
 
representative  on
 Rota
 in
 1990.
 This  may  seem  puzzling  but
 
politics,  like  the  Mariana  Trench,  run  deep.
 I shared  the  panel
 
comments  with  Sandy  and  she  was  not  surprised  at  the  outcome.
 I
 
was scheduled  to meet with the board of  the CCAC  that afternoon at
 
2: 00pm.  In  the mean  time  I went  up  to  the CCAC offices on  Capitol
 
Hill  to  see  the  facilities  and  meet  the current  staff.
 
The office had expanded in size since my  time as a staff member and
 
the  signs  of  growth  were  everywhere.
 I noticed  an  increase  in
 
Contemporary  '
Lsual  artist  showing  and  working  on  island.
 I met
 
Margarita
 Wonenberg
 Executive
 Director,
 Sinforosa
 Pinaula,
 
Traditional/visual
 Arts
 Coordinator,
 and
 Acelia
 Dela
 Cruz,
 
Administrative Specialist.
 Ms.  Wonenberg was the one member of  the
 
staff  appointed  after  my  departure  in  1990  as  Sinforosa,  Acelia,
 
and  Sandy  were  staff  before  and  after  my  time with  the CCAC.
 
I discussed  the  possibility  of  creating  a Folk  Arts  Coordinator
 
position with MS. Wonenberg and Sandy.
 Sinforosa Pinaula was named
 
as  the  most  likely  candidate  for  the  position  and  I was  informed
 
that
 it
 was
 very
 unlikely
 that
 a  person
 of
 non-Chamorro  or
 
Carolinian
 descent
 would
 be  given
 the
 position.
 There  were
 
concerns  exf
lr
ssed  about  Sinforosa
s  aual
4 ic3t1ons  sinc
 she  has
 
no  lormal  Folkl ore  training.
 I suggested  that  she  might  begin
 
researching  the  coll eges  ad  universities  that  offer  programs  or
 
courses  in  the
 field  and  workshops  offered  by  other  state  and
 
federal  arts agencies.
 I also noted  that she did  have a number of
 
years of  practical  experience.
 There  is  the  further  complication
 
of Sinforosa  s home situation as sol e care taker of  infirm parents.
 
I believe  this  5ltuatlon  will  take  some  future  foll ow  up  to  keep
 
it  a part  of  the  future  agenda.
 
After  this morni ng meeting  I toured  the new performance  facilities
 
i
t American Memori a l Park  in Garapan and the new La Fiesta shopping
 
mall
 performance
 facilities  in  San  Rogue.
 The
 facilities  at
 
Ame ri can  Memorial  Park  were  impressive  at  first  d ance.
 1 had
 
produced  the  9th  Annual  Fl ame  Tree  Festival  in  this  park  and  one
 
of  the problems that plagued  the program was the need for a covered
 
stage  large  enough  to  accommodate  a dance  group.
 The  sun  can  be
 
brutal  here and  it  was  hard  to  keep  the stage surface cool  so  the
 
dance  groups  didn' t
 hurt
 their
 feet
 or  over
 heat.
 The  new
 
facilities,
 which
 were
 used
 for
 the
 inauguration,
 are  quite
 
substantial  by  any  standards.
 The  stage  is  covered  by  a sloping
 
roof  and  the backstage area  is enclosed with a green room etc.  The
 
audience  seating  was  not  as  polished  and  still  in  the  process  of
 
being  constructed.
 I was  told  that  there  were  infrastructure
 
probl ems  with  the  water  and  sewer  service  to  the  site  that  may
 
require extensive modification  to  the  to existing  structures.
 
La  Fiesta,  the  new  shopping  mall  in  San  Rogue,  is  a multi-l evel
 
building with an open-air central  plaza.
 The performance space has
 
yet  to used  by  local  traditional  or  contemporary  artist.
 However
 
the CCAC  has  held  craft  and  art  fairs at  the  plaza.  This  is quite
 
an  improvement  over  past  tourism  related  development  since  the
 
local  traditional  crafts  peopl e  have  limited  bu.t direct access  to
 
the  tourism econ omy
.  Th e arrangements
 as  there are still
 in need
 
of  improvement  as Sandy pointed out  the sales of  local  crafts have
 
not been very promising.  She attributes some of  the causes for this
 
as  being  the  size  of  the  works  be  they  paintings,  carvings,  or
 
textil es  and  the  subjective  taste  of  the  tourist.
 The  Japanese
 
tourism  industry  is  known  for  being  a closed  system  and  the  mall
 
is a private commercial  venture which  leads me to assume that there
 
are
 other
 actors
 to
 be
 considered.
 Nevertheless,
 it
 is
 an
 
impressive  structure  and  has  potential  as  a  public  performance
 
space.
 
After  lunch  I met  with  the  director  of  the  CC AC  Ms.  Margarita
 
(Maggy)  Wonenberg,  Sandy  McKenzie,  and  three  members  of  the  CCAC
 
board:  chairperson Lucy Nielsen,  Noel  Quitugua,  and Victoria  (Vic)
 
Cepeda.
 Noel
 Quitugua
 discussed
 the
 Historic
 Preservation
 
Offices  s plans  for  a museum  and  acquisition  and  exhibit  of  some
 
250 photographs  from  the German era on Saipan  that  bel onged  to the
 
German  era  district  administrator.
 All  the  members  of  the  CCAC
 
board who were at  the meeting agreed  that  there was a need for more
 
programs
 that
 '
-j
cuse
 on
 the
 traditional
 arts.
 Ms.
 Nielsen
 
mentioned  that  an ancestor of  hers was a blacksmith and  had  passed
 
away  without  any  documentation  or  record  of
 his  work.
 I was
 
encouraged  by  the  dialogue  at  this  meet
 
and  again  of  the  probl em of  short  staff
 
skills  in  the  local  community.
 To  this
 
must  be  made
 1 f  any  progress  in
 this
 
reality.
 It  1
 s also  apparent  that  with
 
Local s  the  L

 of
 
I Was  given
 
a copy  of  the  CCAC  Grant  Application  Guide and  Program Guide and
 
some programs  Irom the Flame Tree Festivals and the Governor
s Arts
 
Awards ceremonies.
 I have included  these in  the report along with
 
some news  clippings  from  the  local  papers documenting  CCAC events
 
from  1991
 to
 the  present.
 There  is  a  noticeable  absence  of
 
apprenticeship programs,  which  I pointed out  to the board and CCAC
 
Staff.
 
Before  I departed  for Guam  I met with Vicky Olopai  at her house in
 
Chalan  Kanoa.
 Ms.  Olopai  is a highly  respected  in  the Carolinian
 
community  and  the  leader,  organizer,  and  director,  of  an  all  male
 
Carolinian  Dance  troupe named  the Carolinian  Warriors.
 Her group
 
was  featured  as  one  of  the  CNMI  performance  groups  at  the  1992
 
South  Pacific  Festival  in  Roratonga  Cook  Islands.
 She  expressed
 
some  aversion  to  the overly  political  nature  of  the  arts  council
 
and  the  handling  of  the  trip  to  the  festival  in  Roratonga.
 Th
 
type of  sentiment  may  be what  Bess  Lomax-Hawes  spoke off  when  she
 
mentioned  there were noticeable signs of corruption among  the CNMI
 
contingent  in Roratonga.
 Off  island  travel  has been and continues
 
to be perceived  locally as a privil ege of  the well connected,  which
 
it  is  in  many  cases.
 This  fact  should  be  kept  in  mind  when
 
refl ecting  on  the  Rota  grant  application  and  future  applications
 
involving  travel  outside of  the  Micronesian  area.
 
GUAM
 
Contact  Person:  Judy  Flores,  Folk  Arts  Coordinator
 
I arrived  on  Guam  the night  of  the 20th  and  provided  a niahts
 
-
Accommodations  oy  Donald  Rubinstein  former  director  and  staff
 
member  of  the  Micronesian  Area Research Center  (MARC).
 We
 
discussed  the  future  prospects  of  Folk  Arts grant  applications
 
from MARC  and  the communities  they  serve.  I passed  on  the  panel
 
comments  concerning  the grant  application  from MARC  for  the
 
survey  of  Marshall  Islands  pandanus  weavers.
 He was not
 
discouraqed  by  the  rej ection  and  mentioned  that  he was  made  aware
 
f
 he  ausi
:ai nn
 ut  after  its
 -ubmicsion.
 He vas  encouraged
 
to  find  that  MARC  could  be a conduit  for  programs  focusing  on  the
 
traditional  arts  of  the  Islands  in  the FSM and  Palau.
 There  is  a
 
good  chance of  more  applications coming  through MARC  in  the
 
future.
 Mr.  Pubnstein  would  be  a good  consultant  on  future
 
projects  in  this  area  as  he  has  a scholars  knowledge of  the area
 
and  i s
 involved  with  the Carolinian  Community  on  Guam and  the
 
other  islands.
 
On  Friday  mcrnlrin  [
)on  dropped  me  at  the  CAHA  offices  and  gall ery
 
-here  I met  Judy  Fl ores.
 She  said  that  funding  for  her  position
 
had  been  taken  uver  by  the Guam  government,  an  encouraging  sign.
 
Judy  organized  a days  tour  for  my  visit  and  we  took  off
 
lmmediatelv.
 ent  to  Gef  Pa (3o  the  Chamorro  cultural
 
4
 
village site on  the  bay  in  the village of  Inarajan.
 I was  taken
 
on  a guided  tour  by Karen  and  f
lea  two members of  the Gef  Pa'  Go
 
staff  and  residents  of  the village.
 Both Karen  and Bea were
 
knowl edgeabl e of  the  history,  folkways  and  folklore of  Inarajan
 
village  and  provided  a very  informative and  personable  tour.
 
Karen  is  the younger  of  the  two,  and  it was  impressive to witness
 
her  pride  in  imparting  her  knowl edge of  Guam  traditions to myself
 
and  the other  visitors  to Get  Pa'  Go.
 Bea was very dynamic  and
 
exuded  enthusiasm and  also  presented  and  performed  a piece on  the
 
Belembaotuyan.
 I felt
 privileged  to  have  the attention of  both
 
Karen  and  Bea.
 I doubt  anyone  received  as  personlized a tour
 
that day.
 
The site of  Gef  Pa'  Go  is on  the  bay  in  Inarajan  village which
 
has many  homes  and  structures on  the Historic  Preservation
 
Register.  The  replicas of  pre-contact Chamorro  houses were
 
impressive especially  in  light  of  the  recent  earthquake that
 
toppled  the steepl e of  the  historic  church adjacent  to  the site.
 
(Karen  and  f
lea  pointed out  that  the walls of  the church have
 
withstood  many  a quake and  typhoon  due  to  the  local  materials
 
used  as opposed  to  imported  concrete.)
 There were  two designs of
 
pre-contact  houses  one was a small  pitched  roof  thatch structure
 
identified  as  a low class  house.
 The second  type was a bi-level
 
structure,  tn
-l evel  if  you count  the sleeping  platform,  also
 
with a pitched  thatch  roof.
 Each  building  or  hut  housed a
 
dis play  of  traditional  folkways:  salt  refining,  coconut  frond
 
weaving,  LOconut  grating,  candy  making,  and  other  coconut derived
 
products,  pandanus weaving,  and  a katupat  and  foodways
 
demonstration
 
The other  exhibits  were  a hibiscus  rope making  device which
 
produced  a rope  rated  at  around  3, 000  lbs.
 test,  traditionally
 
t
is ecl  to  tether  the carabao  among  other  things.
 Mr.  Manuel
 
Afaison  demonstrated  the  technique  fishing  by  net  casting,  with a
 
net  he  has used  for  more  than  thirty  years.
 He was  also
 
possesses  a wealth of  insight  and  information  on  local  history
 
and  folkways.
 
A s part  of
 the  village  tour  I was  shown  an  ifil  wood  house

  the  19th century.
 
it
s  owned  by  Margaret  L. G.  Bias,  program manager  of  Gef  Pa'  Go,
 
and  descendant  of  the original  builder.
 The  front  room was used
 
to display  historic  photographs,  furniture,  a bel embaotuyan,  and
 
an  old  chamorro  board  game named  chonka.
 It  was  identical  to  the
 
ancient  african  games named  bao  (Tanzania),  omweso  (Uganda),  and
 
ayo (Yoruba/Nigeria)
 
Near  the end  of  my  visit  I had  the  opportunity  to observe a group
 
of  Taiwanese  tourist  visiting  the  village.
 The  Tiatano Dancers,
 
who  are  hiqh  school  students  trained  by  dance  instructor Frank
 
0abon,
 performed  a number  of  historic  dances  as  part  of  the
 
tour.  The  dancers  were  very  professional  and  exhibited  self
 
est e e m  an d
 r id e  throuahout  their  performance.
 Mn.  Rabon  is
 
5
 
 
I
 
regarded  as a master of  traditional  chamorro dance and demands a
 
serious commitment  from his dancers.
 They are selected not only
 
for  their skill  but consideration  is given  to their  being at risk
 
of  delinquency.  Their  performance obviously  impressed  the tourist
 
and afterwards we were all  treated  to a meal  of  traditional  foods
 
such as  kelaguen,  fish,  and  other delights.  The meals was
 
prepared  in  the homes of  residents of  Inarajan village.
 All  of
 
these  things were evidence of  the dedication and  commitment of
 
the community  to make Ge -f Pa'  Go a success.
 
The village was  first  funded  by grant  for underserved
 
communities,  (States and Regional  Program)  and  had started  by
 
providing  field  trip services  to  the  local  schools.  The growth to
 
now providing services  for  tourist and a contrast  to the more
 
glitzy and glamourous  tourist  sites on Guam is a very positive
 
sign  in  my opinion.
 As  I flew  from Hawaii  to Guam the inflight
 
tourism promotional  video about Guam  featured  two host  (a male &
 
female)  neither of  whom were of  Chamorro or Carolinian  heritage.
 
The sights and  locales  they  focused on were more representative
 
of  big city mainland  America attractions such as designer  fashion
 
stores,  discos,  and  broadway show reviews.
 I was  impressed  to
 
see  that  in  spite of  the growth of  that  type of  tourism the Gef
 
Pa'  Go  village  is able  to serve both  the  local  community and  the
 
tourist which do  provide a major source of  income  to  the island.
 
Later  in  the  day  I met  with  Jack  Lujan  the  bl acksmith  at  his
 
home.
 He  snowed  me  his  workshop  and  forge  which  he  has
 
redesigned  so  he  can  work  without  an  assistant.
 He was  featured
 
in  the Taipei  International  Exhibition  of  Traditional  Arts &
 
Crafts  1993 and  the exhibition catalogue.
 This exhibit was
 
produced  by  the Taipei  Fine Arts Museum and  the Council  of
 
Cultural  Planning  and  Development.
 As  is  implied  by  the  titl e  of
 
the  exhibit  ca
ta logue
 Mr.  Luj an
 was
 in  the  company  of  world  c
.i ass
 
traditional  artist  this  shoul d  be  considered  during  the next
 
heritage  awards  revi ew  panel.
 Mr.  Luj an  mentioned  a few of  hi s
 
apprentices  and  expressed  concern  about  their  commitment  of
 
continuing  with  the  trade.
 He  mentioned  that  a pressing  concern
 
of  some  of  the  apprentices  was  their  needs  to make  a living.
 The
 
work  he  disp
avpn  for  me  was  impressive  and  I mentioned  that  I
 
had  seen  his working  exhibit  at  the  1990 Guam Micronesia  Island
 
Fair.
 He  1 5
 an  extremel y  keen  thinker  and  very  personabl e
 
gentl eman.
 
I was unable  to  meet  with  Jesus Crisostomo,  the Belembaotuyan
 
master,  Judy  said  he was  busy with  previous commitments.
 
Evidentl y  he  is  invol ved  with  a number  of  community  based  groups
 
and  proj ects  and  likes  to  stay  occupied.
 I was  tol d  that  his
 
apprentice  (whos p  na me  I can' t  recall  at  the  moment)  went  to
 
Taiwan  last  year  as  he  was  sick  and  coul d  not  make  the  trip.
 
Judy  sai d  that  thi s  is  some  indication  of  her  pl aying  ability  and
 
willingness  to  perform  in  public.
 
After  leaving Mr.  Lujan' s we went  to visit with Segundo Bias the
 
woodcarver at  his  home.
 He  is also a very  humble and  astute
 
person.
 I was welcomed  into his  home and workshop and shown a
 
number of  his canoes,  statues,  and  a storyboard  table.
 He also
 
showed me his  first adz  that  he made when  he was  fifteen.
 He
 
spoke of  his past as a carpenter on  Saipan during  the Japanese
 
era and  later during  post WWII  times,  needless  to say he- was a
 
survivor of  the massive bombings and destruction of  WWII.
 He
 
lost  his wife  last year and  is  living  alone next door  to some
 
family members.
 
Judy  told me  that Manny  Ikea  has chosen  to go underground  (to
 
Satawal?),  due  to his  fear of  prosecution  for a vehicle accident
 
that  resulted  in  a fatality.
 She expressed  her disappointment at
 
this development  but was optimistic  about  the canoe and
 
navigation  projects continuation.
 I can  attest  to  the  fear of
 
Carolinians  have of  receiving extra stiff  prosecution  by
 
authorities on Guam.  Don Rubinstein  spoke to me about  the
 
treatment and  bias some FSM and Palauan citizens receive from
 
some members of  the Guam government  and community.
 This  is  I
 
feel  a result of  the uneven  and  selective relationship the US
 
government  has  had  with this area  in  general  fostering  an elitism
 
that  is  based on  this  relationship.
 This  has a direct affect on
 
the  traditional  arts as many  in  the upper class are attempting  to
 
distance  themselves  from their  less. americanized neighbors.
 I
 
was short  for  time at  this  point,  had  a plane  to catch and  I
 
would  have gladly  stayed  longer  as  there was much more  to see and
 
learn  about  the  traditional  arts  in
 Micronesia.

Editor's I
ntroduction
 
Nearly e
ighty-seven years ago, a young German f
oreign s
ervice officer
 
named Georg Fritz a
ssumed h
is post a
s District Officer of t
he German Mariana
 
I
slands.  Fritz p
roved t
o be an energetic and capable administrator and h
is
 
e
ight-year t
enure on Saipan was marked with s
olid achievements. I
n addition
 
t
o h
is administrative duties, Fritz a
lso f
ound t
ime t
o make observations about
 
t
he l
ocal Chamorro and Carolinian cultures.  Early i
n h
is administration, he
 
p
repared  a h
istory  and  e
thnography  i
n  which  he  r
ecorded  many  o
f  t
hese
 
observations, e
specially f
ocusing on t
he i
slands' Chamorro population. His account
 
was l
ater published i
n t
he German j
ournal Ethnologisches Notizblatt i
n 1904.
 
The Saipan Fritz v
isited a
t t
he end o
f t
he n
ineteenth century bears l
ittle
 
r
esemblance t
o t
he bustling capital of t
he Com monwealth of t
he 1980s. When
 
Fritz arrived he f
ound t
he i
sland's 1
,600 r
esidents l
iving i
n quaint, t
hatched-roof(
 
houses i
n two small v
illages. There was no e
lectricity, running water o
r medic
 
f
acilities, nor was t
here a cash economy o
r a t
rade deficit. Chamorros a
t
 
Carolinians l
ived peaceful, i
f uneventful, l
ives t
ending t
heir small gardens a
t
 
l
ivestock and a
ttending daily mass a
t t
he Catholic church.
 
Fritz's account, which i
s r
ich i
n details o
f everyday l
ife, p
rovides t
he r
ead
 
with  an accurate  p
icture  o
f what  modern  Chamorros  consider t
o be  t
he
 
t
raditional customs. The account t
akes on a special importance i
n t
he l
igi
 
of t
he rapid westernization of t
he Chamorro culture f
ollowing t
he Second Won
 
War.
 
The t
ext of Fritz's account was t
ranslated i
n t
he early 1980s by E
lfried
 
Craddock, a native German speaker who j
v a
lso f
luent i
n t
he English l
anguagn
 
Her manuscript served a
s t
he basis f
or t
his published account. Editorial work
 
was  l
imited  to  rendering  o
ften  convoluted  German-English  s
entences  m
t
 
understandable  English.  This  work was compounded by Fritz's i
nclination t
'
 
connect series of sentences by t
he u
se of s
emi-colons. These have been change
 
t
o be consistent with modern punctuation. The editor, while making t
hese changes
 
has attempted to r
emain
 a
s c
losely a
s possible t
o Fritz's o
riginal s
tyle am'
 
meaning.
 
One confusing aspect of t
his account i
s Fritz's habit of mixing accounts
 
of early European observations of Chamorro culture (
notably t
he accounts o
f
 
Le Gobien) with h
is own observations. While one can appreciate h
is i
ntentions,
 
i
t i
s often d
ifficult t
o determine whether t
he observations p
resented a
re o
l
 
p
recontact  Chamorro  customs  o
r  of  customs  contemporary  with  Fritz'
-
administration.
 
No a
ttempt was made t
o r
ender Fritz's spelling o
f Chamorro words m
t
 
modern  orthography.  They  appear,  i
talicized,  as  t
hey  d
id  i

n cases where i
t was suspected t
ha
 
a t

t
he western and eastern oceans and a new r
oute t
o I

t
he worst hardships, mutiny, s
torms, cold and f
a mine, he r
eached t
he s
trait
 
which bear h
is name, i
n t
he Pacific Ocean, on 2
7 November 1
520. He had a
lreat
 
l
ost two ships. Water and f
eod were r
unning s
hort and officers, and c
rews wer ,
 
becoming unsure of t
heir u
ltimate success. The f
orce o
f h
is personality a
lor
 
s
upported the uncertain ones and with courage o
f genius, he continued t
he voyay
 
i
nto t
he unknown. Many men f

ispair r
ose t
o i
t
 
peak after more t
han a month when t
he f
irst i
slands were d
iscovered. The
 
p
roved to be uninhabited and desert-like. They called t
hem '
Las Desventurada
 
t
he Unfortunates.
 
This d
istress l
asted two more months, until 6 March 1
521 when two beautif ,
 
i
slands emerged which Magellan named after Saint Lazarus. A number of sm e 
canoes with t
riangular s
ails soon surrounded t
he ships, manned by completet
 
naked natives. They came on board without f
ear and b
rought t
he Spanish f
ruit
 
of t
he l
and. But soon t
hey became t
oo obtrusive. The small p
resents o
f t
i
 
Spanish, e
specially t
hose made f
rom metal, which was until t
hen unknown
 
t
nem, encouraged t
hem to t
ake t

heir own. Yes, t
hey t
ook one of t
i
 
boats and this r
esulted i
n a f
ight. The natives f
ought w
ith t
hrow spears an
 
s
lings and covered t
he s
hips with a hail of s
tones. But t
heir weapons were n
(
 
equal to t
he Spanish f
irearms. The Spanish k
illed some and p
lundered and burn
 
a small v
illage on t
he beach. Because o
f t
hese events, Magellan named t
he i
slan
 
t
he  Ladrones  or '
I
slands o
f Thieves'. After t
he f
leet was s
upplied with wat
 
and f
ood, i
t sailed on 9 March 1521 and r
eached t
he Philippines where i
ts darir

ook off completed t
he f
irst c

and returned to Spain under t
he com mand of E

 September 1522.
 
On a second voyage, E

iscovered t
he i

n 1524. On
 
t
hird, Legaspi t
ook f
ormal possession o

I
n 1665, on h
is voyage t
o Manila, Sanvitores had s
topped b

He deplored t
he nakedness and t
he paganism o

he i

is r
eports
 
moved t

I

P

stablished a s

This

 t
 
I

Before t

There were no chiefs, only a f

The weapons of t

On t

lago,  Juapsan,  Juarahan,  Merizo,  Hu matag and  Agat.  He destroyed a
ll other
 
l
ocalities and yards and forced the natives to settle around the churches.
 
At the head of the co m munities he p
laced Cha morros devoted to h
i m. This
 
entralization  had  the desired success.  Under the constant supervision of the
 
p
riests, the people gave up their o
ld custo ms, forgot their songs, covered their
 
nakedness and ca me to mass regularly. They married for l
ife and buried their
 
end i
n the co m mon ce metery. The skulls and the l
ances made of hu man bone
 
anished. They ate meat, p
lanted corn and d
id not s
in openly any more. But one
 
i
ore t
ime the enslaved people arose for a l
ast, a
l most successful s
truggle.
 
Quiroga, the f
eared and active f
riend of the  Jesuits, was replaced by Esplana
 
i
n 1683. However. Quiroga re mained under the co m mand of the l
atter and sailed
 
with a part of the t
roops acco mpanied by 40 canoes which v
isited Saipan. As
 
a result of the d
isturbances i
n the l
ast few years. a
ll of the priests had withdrawn
 
f
ro m the other i
slands [
those north of Gua m]. They [
the Spanish expedition] put
 
i

irst, where the i
nhabitants, under the l
eadership of Kaisa, sub mitted
 
without resistance. They s
trengthened the f
leet with their canoes. They sailed
 
to the port of Tanapag and were attacked there by the Saipanese who a
l most
 
succeeded i
n taking away the f
rigate. The Spaniards and their a
llies l
anded under
 
a hail of s
lingstones and l
ances. They put the ene my to f
light and l
aid waste
 
to the i
sland. The main settle ment Alaian -
 p
resumably Laulau on t
he east coast.
 
where extensive r
uins a

in t
he early 1
900s] -
 was burned. The
 
p
rincipal l
eader, Ladahan. e
scaped t
o Gani, t
he name g

o t
he i

f

he Spanish f

orce s
ailed t
here and
 
s
ubjugated t
hem without effort. Quiroga, however, whose a
llies s
eem t

deserted h

imself i
n t
he south of Saipan.
 
I
n t
he meanti me, t
he Chamorros on Guahan under t
he l
eadership of Jula,
 
had organized a conspiracy. Experience had t
aught t
hat an open a
ttack, even
 
with overwhelming numerical superiority was l
ikely t
o be unsuccessful against
 
t
he f
irearms of t
he Spanish. Therefore. one Sunday, only 60 determined men
 
came with concealed weapons t
o t
he church i
n Hagatnia. At t
he end of t
he mass,
 
t
hey a
ttacked t
he Spaniards. k
illing 45 s
oldiers and some p
riests and wounding
 
t
he governor s
everely. Then Jula, t
heir l
eader, f
ell and a
s a
lways i
n t
heir battles,
 
t
he smallest s
uccess of t
he enemy caused t
hem t
o waver.  This accident a
lso
 
cost them v
ictory, which t
hey a
lready had i
n t
heir hands and s
aved t
he Spaniards
 
f
rom total destruction. The s
urvivors gained t
ime t
o collect t
hemselves and t
he
 
f
aithful Chamorro chief Hineti with h
is people, hastened t
o t
heir a
id and d
rove
 
t
he rebels away.
 
When t
he  news  of t
hese events spread, t
he p
riests Angelis [
Theofilo] i
n
 
Ritidian, Boranga [Carlos] i
n Rota and S
trobach [Augustin] i
n T
inian, i
n addition
 
t
o s
ixteen Spanish soldiers, were murdered. The men of T
inian burned Quiroga's
 
f
rigate which was anchored t
here and r
etired with t
hose f
rom Rota t
o Saipan.
 
Quiroga r
epelled t
heir a
ttack and, when he f
inally l
earned of t
he events i
n Guahan,
 
r
eturned there with e
ight canoes. Three of t
hese capsized and t
heir c
rews s
aved
 
t
hemselves by swim ming t
o T
inian. They were well r
eceived t
here and were s
ent
 
back t
o Guahan.
 
The behavior of t
he i
nhabitants on T
inian shows how much t
hese people
 
were moved by t
he mood of t
he moment, which made p
lanned, consistent action
 
[
against  the Spanish]  impossible.  I
n t
he course o
f one year, t
hey had a
llied
 
t
hemselves with Quiroga against Saipan, t
hen k
illed t
he Spanish occupants and
 
t
hen united with Rota and Saipan against Quiroga and f
inally welcomed helpless
 
Spaniards. They submitted, upon s
eeing t
he Spanish f
ighting f
orce, r
evolted when
 
t
hey received t
he news of t
he d
isaster of t
he Spaniards on Guahan and t
hen
 
supported them again when t
heir a
ttack on Saipan was unsuccessful. The 25 soldiers
 
and Father Coomans [
Pierre] s
ent by Quiroga t
o Gani, r
eturned t
o Saipan i
n f
ive
 
4
 
boats. On a p
rearranged s
ignal, t
he native l
eaders capsized t
he boats. Only f
ive
 
soldiers and Coomans could s
ave t
hemselves by swim ming t
o Alamagan. Despite
 
t
his reprieve, t
hey were a
lso murdered after r
eturning t
o Saipan.
 
However, another danger r
eappeared; t
he l
eaders Esplana and Quiroga were
 
i
n d
isagreement and were j
ealous of each o
ther. The p
riests acted against t
he
 
governor who was not t
o t
heir l
iking and t
he t
roops became demoralized. After
 
Esplana's departure, t
he soldiers r
evolted and j
ailed Quiroga and t
he Tagalogs
 
supported the natives. Only with d
ifficulty was o
rder r
estored again. I
n 1694
 
Quiroga became governor again and completed h
is t
ask of centralization, which
 
resulted i
n the depopulation of a
ll i
slands besides Guahan and Rota and t
he
 
destruction of the natives. I
n 1695, a
ll i
nhabitants of T
inian, who had f
led t
o
 
t
he i
naccessible i
sland of Aguigan, were b
rought t
o Guahan and t
hose f
rom Goni
 
t
o Saipan. Those a
lso had t
o s
ettle i
n Guahan i
n 1
698.
 
What t
he war d
id not destroy was now e
li minated by epidemics and f
a mine.
 
I
n 1688, a ship f
rom Mexico b
rought an epidemic which d
id not spare anyone.
 
"
It was a k
ind of cold. accompanied by f
ever and spitting of b
lood. All t

however, who l

Le Gobein 3
76).
 
I
n 1700, a t
errible epidemic carried off a
lmost t

(
de l

o t

he e

but supported by enumeration of v

The r
esult of t
he s
laughter were a

s

heir colonies, t
he Spaniards were able to conquer
 
and to destroy but not t

The t

therefore not capable of improvement. I

consisted of 150 men, two companies of Spaniards and one company of F

Le Gobien made t
he f
ollowing observations "These i

n Guahan a

When t

150 smaller ones, l

rom t
he r

ther s

One counted 180 l

han twenty houses. I
f one calculates f
or
 
each only f

t r
esults i
n a mini mum number o

t
here a
re t

han twenty houses
 
and t
he numerous i

here a
re  unmarried  men who
 
had t
heir com munity house i
n each v

stimate t
hat Guahan had 30,000
 
i
nhabitants does not s
eem a
t a
ll exaggerated.
 
After e
ight months o
f missionary activity, t
he number of t
hose baptized
 
-
 on a
ll i

 amounted t
o 1
3,000. There were more t

catechumens, among t
hese were 4
,000 baptized on t
he r
elatively unimportant
 
Gani i

672, about 50,000 had been baptized (
Le Gobien 1

Further, a

we may believe t

ssume a

Then came t

he Tagalogs with t

unions which were encouraged by
 
t
he p

I
n 1790, besides t

I
n 1815, Carolinians f

n t

1865 to 1869, over 1
,000 workers f
rom Lamotrek, Satawal and E

ettled
 
on Pagan, Saipan and Guam (
in Tamuning); some f

b
irth and do not even get t

heir boats
 
went f

o i

ince t
hese [
the i

t
hese voyages ceased. S
till, until t
he 1880s, t
hese ocean boats t
ravelled between
 
Guam, Rota, T

hese shipwrecked, t
he Spanish
 
government p

his t

raffic completely [
Fritz appears t

r

o Carolinian sailing canoes which were built and sailed among t
he
 
i

The Spanish government had moved t

rom t

s

hey became unaccustomed
 
t

hese accomplishments r
e mained skills
 
which d
id not develop i

rofessions because no demand existed f
or t
hese
 
performances and p
roducts.  Their  Christianity i
s very superficial i
n spite of
 
t
heir seeming p
iety. And i
n spite of t
heir p
ride and self-interest, t
heir l
aziness
 
does not permit t
hem t
o work t
oward more t
han what t
hey need. There a
re
 
no artisans i
n our [German] s
ense, who pursue t
heir t
rade exclusively o
r a

and s

Only sometimes out of necessity o

leasure does one work as a smith,
 
a cabinet maker o

but r

The mono t

t about one and one half Marks, someti mes
 
r
eplaces, even today, money and one calculates according t
o mono. I
f a
 Chamorro
 
needs money, he sells h

I

his i
s t
he case, t
he f
ollowing
 
calculations are used: one mano t
chupa equals one kaban foe (
unhusked r
ice),
 
one kaban equals 25 gantas, one ganta equals e
ight t
chupa, and one ganta equals
 
t
hree l

The ancient Chamorros knew no household animals and only a f

t

occupied honorary positions and r
eceived small pay. However, t
hey enjoyed an
 
a
lmost unli mited rule a
t t
heir d

as, able-bodied men f
rom
 
1
5 to 50 years of age, were obligated to a work assignment of f
ifteen days
 
annually f
or com munity and s
tate purposes.
 
This obligation could be i
ncreased o

he d
iscretion
 
o
f t
he l

or t
he v

and t

I
n t
he administration of j

he whole population was dependent upon
 
t

he p

The  German  administration  has  r

a

Chamorros and Carolinians happened very s

These bad ghosts, even when unprovoked, l
ove t
o make f
ools of humans.
 
This i
s what happened t
o two s
isters, one of whom was married and p
regnant
 
and the o
ther s
ingle. One evening t
hey walked t
hrough t
he f
orest. The p
regnant
 
one had to g

o t

ther s
atisfied her bodily f
unctions near
 
an ancient house and f
ound t
he p

o her surprise, i
n her b
readbasket.
 
Despite t
heir u
sually unfriendly f
eelings t
oward t
he Christians, t
he anite
 
are not unapproachable. They cultivate f
riendship and r
elations with certain
 
f
amilies whose members t
hey counsel during hunting and f
ill t
he f
ishnets f
or
 
them. Mostly women a
re t
he f
riends of t
he unite and are called kakana (
not
 
macana, a
s Le Gobien r
eports). Through t
he i
ntercession o
f s
uch persons, much
 
can be obtained f
or o
ther people f
rom t
he f
orest s
pirits. [
For example] two
 
children were l
ost i
n t
he woods. The parents s
earched f
or t
hem i
n vain and f
inally
 
t
urned t
o t
he kakana f
or a
ssistance. The kakana named t
he p
lace where t
he
 
children were but warned t
he parents not t
o s
top a
long t
hey way. They d
id i
t
,
 
i
n s
pite o
f t
he warning, and t
he children were f
ound dead.
 
I
n Garapan l
ives a woman who communicates with unite. Her f
ather was
 
a
lso acquainted with one. The woman's husband has observed how s
he walked
 
i
nto t
he f
orest a
t n
ight and t
alked with ghosts. She i
s not a
fraid but he does
 
not l
ike s
ee her do t
his.
 
Another kakana wanted t
o g
ive up her unchristian communications w
ith
 
the unite. She put on t
he e
scapulario and went t
o church. Now, however, she
 
does not dare walk i
nto t
he f
orest a
t n
ight. Also s
he became s
ick f
or a l
ong
 
t
ime.
 
Naturally, t
he kakana l
earn f
rom t
heir s
pirit f
riends many s
ecret a
rts and
 
magic. One kanaka had a
 c
raving f
or a
 certain pastry which another woman offered
 
for sale. When t
he seller denied t
he pastery t
o t
he kakana s
he got s
ick and a
lmost
 
choked on a b

tuck i

ushed t
o t
he kakana
 
and t
hreatened her with death. H
is wife got well again a

a

Soon a

Marianas, a
nd workers were s
oon b

J

These i

ttempts a

ugar
 
i
ndustry f
ailed miserably due mainly t
o mis-
management a
nd a s
lump i

or s
ugar.
 I
t was not until 1921 t
hat t
he
 
Nan'yo  Kohatsu  Kaisha  -

known a

 was e
stablished i

Under Matsue's s

The i

he
 
hallmark of t
he J
apanese administration, was
 
r
esponsible f
or u
shering i

rofound changes i

THE GATHERING STORM
 
As t
he Mariana I
slands were being a
ssimilated a
s
 
an i
ntegral part o
f t
he J
apanese Empire, t
he
 
government of J
apan began i
ts move t
oward
 
militarism.  The a
rmy, which had t
raditionally
 
p
layed an important r
ole i
n t
he a
ffairs o
f t
he
 
J
apanese nation, during t
he 1930s, a
ssumed an
 
even g
reater i
nfluence over f
oreign policy, an i
n-
f
luence which r
esulted i
n J
apan's i
nvasion o
f
 
Manchuria i
n 1931.  This military adventurism
 
g
reatly antagonized J
apan's r
elations with t
he
 
United S
tates and, not s
urprisingly, af
fected i
ts
 
r
ule of t
he Nan'yo.
 
P
rior t
o t
he i
nvasion o
f Manchuria, t
here had
 
been l
i
ttle debate concerning J
apan's r
ule o
f
 
mandated Micronesia.
 For nearly a decade,
 
members o
f t
he League of Nations were content
 
t
o r
eview t
he d

eports meticulously
 
p
repared by t
he Nan'yo cho c
oncerning i

apan's a

l
ater Korea, however c
onvinced military l
eaders
 
i
n J
apan and t
he United S
tates t
hat a war
 
between t
he two Pacific powers was i
nevitable
 
and, owing t
o i
ts obvious s
trategic v
alue, t
he
 
Nan'yo s
oon c
ame t
o dominate t
he t
houghts o
f
 
military p
lanners on both s
ides.
 
As a
 r
esult of i
ncreasing c
riticism o
f i
t
s military
 
policies by t
he western powers, J
apan, i
n 1935,
 
announced i
ts i
ntention of withdrawing f
rom t
he
 
League two years hence, an a
ction which f
urther
 
s
trained i
ts a
lready poor r
elations with t
he United
 
S
tates. By v
irtue of t
his move, t
he i
s
lands o
f
 
Micronesia became de f
acto possessions o
f t
he
 
J
apanese Empire, a
lthough J
apan c
arefully r
e-
f
rained f
rom annexing t
hem outright.
 
With t
he possibility o
f war with t
he United
 
S
tates i
ncreasing, t
he J
apanese Navy implemented
 
measures t
o c
onceal t

which was now being t
outed a
