Mrs. Johnson Yuba City, Calif., 1940
Goin' down to Rousers, To Rousers, to Rousers, Goin' down to Rousers, To get some
lager beer.
Right and left to Rousers, To Rousers, to Rousers, Right and left to Rousers, To get some
lager beer.

Shoot the Buff-a-lo, Oh we'll shoot the Buff-a-lo, Rattle through the cane-brake To shoot
the Buff-a-lo.

Happy was the miller boy That lived on the hill. Every time the mill turned It turned at its
will.
Hand on the hopper, Foot on the slab - Every time the mill turns, Grab boys, Grab!
