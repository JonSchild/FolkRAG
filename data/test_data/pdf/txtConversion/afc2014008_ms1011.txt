REMA
.RKS BY THE PRESIDENT
 
IN WHITE HOUSE PRESIDENTIAL ARTS MEDPL CEREMONY
 
T H E  P RESI DEN T :
 
y o u
 v e r y
 
m uch.
 
As a person who at various times in his life has been a
 
frustrated writer and a frustrated musician, this is an extremely
 
humbling event for me today.
 (Laughter.)
 But I
've been getting a
 
lot of training in humility lately.
 (Laughter.)
 I have a Vice
 
President who humbles me all the time by all the things he teaches me
 
about things great and insignificant -- (
laughter)  -- and who unlike
 
me actually got to go on David Letterman to prove how funny he was.
 
And I have a wife who swept the television ratings last
 
week talking about the arcana of health care with a passion and an
 
eloquence -- (
applause).  As if that weren't bad enough, USA Today
 
had the bad grace to go out and poll the American people, and 40
 
percent of them said she was smarter than I am.
 (Laughter.)
 To
.-
which I reply, of course, what kind of dummy do you think I am.
 
(Laughter.)
 How else would I have gotten elected President.
 
And just to drive this humility home -- this is the
 
actual true part of this wonderful story -- I went to southern
 
California last week, or the first of this week, and I was looking
 
forward to staying in the Beverly Hilton -- it seemed like an exotic
 
sort of place.
 And I showed up, and Mery Griffin, who owns it, shook
 
hands with me, and took me up to the floor where I was staying --
there is only one person who is a permanent resident of the floor
 
where I stayed in the Beverly Hilton -- Rodney Dangerfield --
(
laughter)  -- who said they had put me there because we seem to
 
belong t
i
-u4athar.
 (Laughter.)
 An
.d gave me 12 roses with a little
 
respect on a gift card.
 (Laughter.)
 
I am delighted to be here to honor this year's winners
 
of the National Medal of the Arts and the Charles Frankel Prize --
men and women whose achievement6 represerre the t
.nduring power of the
 
arts and humanities and, in a larger sense, of the creative spirit in
 
all of our lives.
 
Throughout history, the arts and humanities have been
 
the cultural signature of this great nation.
 They have enabled
 
Americans of all backgrounds and walks of life to gain a deeper
 
appreciation of who they are as individuals and who we all are as a
 
society, stirring our minds and our senses, stimulating learning and
 
collective discourse, the arts and humanities teach us in ways that
 
nothing else can about the vastness and the depth of human
 
experience.
 They are. our great equalizers.  We inherit them, and we
 
can all participate in them.
 
-2 -
Whether or not one plays an instrument, reads poetry,
 
learns to pirouette, or spends hours alone in a local art gallery, we
 
all have the capacity to be moved by a song, a poem, a story, a
 
dance, a painting.
 We can feel our spirit soar when we see an
 
intriguing film, or the sudden illumination of a new idea, or an old
 
idea put in a new way.
 
At a time when our society faces new and profound
 
challenges, at a time when we are losing so many of our children, at
 
a time when so many of our people feel insecure in the fa
 of
 
change, the arts and humanities must remain a vital part of our lives
 
-
-
 as individuals and as a nation.
 
For 200 years, the freedom of our artistic and
 
intellectual imagination has contributed to the quality of our civic
 
life.
 It has helped to shape American ideas of democracy, of
 
pluralism, of tolerance.
 Three decades ago, President Kennedy said
 
this:
 "There's a connection, hard to explain logically but easy to
 
feel, between achievement and public life, and progress in the arts."
 
The Jeffersonian era gave birth not only to the Declaration of
 
Independence, but also to beautiful Monticello.
 The age of Lincoln
 
produced the Emancipation Proclamation, along with the Hudson River
 
School of Painting and the writings of Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry
 
David Thoreau and Harriet Beecher Stowe.
 
The first half of this century gave us universal
 
suffrage and the empowerment of American workers, as well as Charlie
 
Chaplin, Frank Lloyd Wright, William Faulkner, Marian Anderson and
 
Duke Ellington.
 
The same unbridled energy and potent imagination that
 
took Americans to the moon inspired rock and roll, Motown, modern
 
daiica and a new U
.Mphdb
.-L
b On civil and human i
.ighLs.
 
Those of you gathered with us today are reminders that
 
the human imagination is still the most powerful tool we have in
 
moving forward as a civilization.
 You provoke our minds, you enliven
 
our senses, endow our souls, help us to give our lives meaning.
 
That's why public support for the arts and humanities remains
 
essential today and for generations to come.
 (Applause.)
 
Today, we are indeed fortunate to have inspiring new
 
leaders working in government to expand our artistic and humanistic
 
endeavors, to carry on our heritage to future generations.
 I'm very
 
proud of the work and the life that Sheldon Hackney and that Jane
 
Alexander have lived before they came to this work.
 I thank them for
 
their work here.  And I tell you that we welcome all of you to give
 
us your ideas, your suggestions and your energy as we try to move
 
forward together.
 
!
T z it la a privil
e '
to call forward the following
 
recipients of the National Medal of Arts.
 
First, the contributions of Walter and Leonore Annenberg
 
to American cu1ti re can literally not be overscated.
 The Asirien
rgs
 
have enriched our appreciation of the arts through public service,
 
publishing, and as board members of major arts institutions.
 They
 
have given generously of their time and their money.
 And they
 
provided among other things the magnificent portrait of Benjamin
 
Franklin, which hangs in the Green Room at the White House -
-
 one of
 
the most prized possessions of this, your American home.
 (Applause.)
 
(Medal is presented.)
 
The legendary vocalist and bandleader Cab Calloway has
 
had indeed a remarkable career -
-
 one of the originators of American
 
jazz.
 An enduring figure in popular music, Cab Calloway added "Hi-
dee-ho" and the "scat" sound to our musical vocabulary.
 
MORE
 
-3 -
And for those of us who have lived a while, we can enjoy
 
seeing the brightness of his smile in our memories going back for
 
decades.
 He is an American original, and I am deeply honored that
 
he's here with us today.
 (Applause.)
 
(Medal is presented.)
 
MR. CALLOWAY:  Hi-dee-ho!
 (Applause.)
 Thank you very,
 
very much.
 This comes on a very, very beautiful day for me.
 This. is
 
my 49th wedding anniversary.
 (Applause.)  My wife is here -
- .
 
(Applause.)
 
Literally for decades, Ray Charles has been one of
 
America's favorite singers.
 From his roots in Georgia, he became one
 
of the first great truly American singers, one of the first to
 
combine the dynamic energy of gospel music with rhythm and blues.
 
His songs are indelibly etched in the hearts of millions of
 
Americans.
 
I can tell you that it's a particular honor for me to
 
give him this award today, because I suppose no singer ever had a
 
bigger impact on my musical life than Ray Charles.
 I still remember
 
over there in Constitution Hall a concert I attended on June the
 
24th,  1967.
 I was notable for being one of a few members of my race
 
in the audience.
 And Ray Charles electrified that crowd so much that
 
that night, I literally could not go to sleep until 5 a
.m. in the
 
morning -
-
 I went out and ran three miles to get the energy out.  And
 
I still remember to this day the date of the concert.
 That is
 
testament to the enduring impact of this phenomenal American
 
original.
 (Applause.)
 
(Medal is presented.)
 
Our next honoree, I believe, is part of the only
 
brother-sister team ever to receive this great award.
 Bess Lomax
 
Hawes has played a major role in the American folk movement since the
 
1940$ as a singer, a teacher, a composer, an author of articles and
 
books that help bring the folk arts into the lives of countless
 
Americans.
 At a time when our native folk arts are largely lost to
 
millions of our younger people, she has performed an invaluable
 
service to our nation in helping us to remember who we are and how we
 
got here.
 (Applause.)
 
(Medal is presented.)
 
You know what she said?  She said, I wish all the
 
beautiful artists I
've recorded and seen across the years in this
 
country were here to receive this award for me.
 They were the
 
inspir'
.ticn for what I did.
 Thank you.
 (Applause.)
 
Poet and educator, Stanley Kunitz has spent a life
 
opening America's eyes and ears to poetry.
 He makes the ordinary
 
become extraordinary, the everyday become timeless and significant.
 
He was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for ?o√®try in 1959, and his works
 
grace us still.
 
Welcome, Stanley Kunitz.
 (Applause.)
 
Robert Merrill has been acclaimed by critics as one of
 
the great natural baritones of the century.
 He's appeared in 787
 
performances at the Metropolitan Opera over a 31-year operatic
 
career.
 He's also sung on Broadway and many solo recitals and on
 
television.
 And all of us who have ever heard him sing wish, as I
 
tried to persuade him to do today, that this would be the 787th
 
performance.
 (Laughter.)
 He turned i
nc down, but I still think we
 
should give him the medal.

Mr. Robert Merrill.
 (Applause.)
 
(Medal is presented.)
 
Arthur Miller has given our nation some of the finest
 
plays of this century.
 His character, Willy Loman in "Death of a
 
Salesman," caught the public's imagination by conveying the tension
 
and drama of a common man's life.
 In "The Crucible," he focused on
 
issues of conscience by probing the Salem witch trials of the late
 
17th century.
 H? won the pujitze
, ,f Prize for Drama in 194
 The
 
thing that has always impressed me about him was the continuing
 
energy he has brought to his work over such a long period of time,
 
seeming forever young with something always new to say.
 Please
 
welcome Arthur Miller.
 (Applause.)
 
(Medal is presented.)
 
Robert Rauschenberg is one of America's most innovative
 
artists whose remarkable works have been displayed in museums and
 
galleries around the world, and who has really helped to transform
 
our notions of contemporary art.  Modern art is often inaccessible to
 
a lot of people who don't go to art galleries and often don't
 
understand it.
 I have personally been impressed by how many people I
 
know who don't count themselves as connoisseurs, who have seen and
 
been moved by the works of our next honoree, Robert Rauschenberg.
 
(
Applause.)
 
(Medal is presented.)
 
He's also a pretty good comic.
 I said it's great to see
 
you here today.
 He said, oh, I
'll show up for this anytime.
 
(Laughter.)
 
Lloyd Richards has devoted his career to promoting
 
theater in America.  As Dean of the Yale School of Drama and Artistic
 
Director of the Yale Repertory Theater, he has trained some our
 
nation's finest young talents, many of whom have turned into our
 
finest, not so young talents, helping to make for him a remarkable
 
legacy for which we are all grateful, Lloyd Richards.
 (Applause.)
 
(Medal is presented.)
 
Well, I got another little lesson in humility back
 
there.
 He said, you both have said some nice things today; and then
 
he looked at me and he said, and you did something for stand-up
 
comedy also.
 (Laughter.)
 And then he said, well,  at least you
 
didn't set it back.
 (Laughter.)
 
William Styron's haunting works,  including "Lie Down in
 
Darkness," "The Confessions of Nat Turner," and "Sophie's Choice"
 
capture '
,ur biqtnry i
 h
 ct
 vith a pa
iM  and insight few
 
others have ever achieved.
 His compelling prose as a fiction writer
 
and essayist has won him readers around the world -
-
 those of us who
 
anxiously await each new word.
 
I can tell you that as a young southerner, the impact of
 
"The Confessions of Nat Turner" on me was truly stunning.  And I can
 
say that for a whole generation of us who had never quite found words
 
to give expression to many of the things we had imagined until we
 
read the works of William Styron.
 (Applause.)
 
(Medal is presented.)
 
Paul Taylor has been one of our nation's preeminent
 
dancers and choreographers for more than three decades.  And I might
 
say, he looks as if he could outdance most of us in this country
 
still today.
 His more than 80 works explore the richness, the
 
complexity of the American character, and graphically demonstrate the
 
MORE
 
L
.
 
-5 -
deep undercurrents of human relations in a way few other
 
choreographers have ever been able to do.
 Please join me in
 
welcoming Paul Taylor.
 (Applause.)
 
(Medal is presented.)
 
Since coming to this country in the 1930s, Billy Wilder
 
has helped to transform the American motion picture industry.  As a
 
writer, director and producer, his name attached to many classics of
 
American film.  H's won six Academy Award:; and millions of fans.
 
And, perhaps most imp or tan t, he 's g iven
 us  a lot  of moving movie
 
moments.
 If you've never laughed at a funny Billy Wilder picture,
 
you have never laughed.
 (Laughter.)
 Mr. Billy Wilder.
 (Applause.)
 
(Medal is presented.)
 
Now, it is my great honor to introduce the winners of
 
the Charles Franke2
. Prize.
 Ricardo E. Alegria is an historian and
 
anthropologist who has dedicated his career to the study and public
 
appreciation of Caribbean culture.
 I
'm glad to see so many of his
 
supporters from his native Puerto Rico today, and I thank him for
 
coming this long way to be with us.  Mr. Alegria.
 (Applause.)
 
(Award is presented.)
 
In a 50-year career as a writer and a teacher, historian
 
John Hope Franklin has been a leading scholar of African-American
 
studies and an active voice in the social transformation of America.
 
He's won nearly 100 honorary degrees.  He's served on the National
 
Council of Humanities.
 His writings have illuminated his subject for
 
a whole generation after generation of young readers.
 I was once one
 
of them -
-
 a reader, and young -
-
 reading John Hope Franklin.
 
And I
'd like to say that one of the great moments of our
 
1992 campaign was when John Hope Franklin came on one of our bus
 
trips with us; and Al Gore and Tipper and Hillary and I sat and had a
 
chance to visit with him, and really learn something from a man -who
 
has mastered the mystery of America.
 John Hope Franklin.
 
(
Applause.)
 
(Award is presented.)
 
Manna Holborn Gray has had a truly remarkable career.
 
She served for 15 years as President of the University of Chicago,
 
where she became a highly visible and widely acclaimed advocate for
 
higher education.
 She has been honored for her scholarship, her
 
words and her work in many ways, especially in receiving the
 
Presidential Medal of Freedom, our country's highest civilian award.
 
She deserves greatly the award she receives today.
 Manna Gray.
 
(
Applause.)
 
(Award is presented.)
 
After a distinguished career as Chairman and Chief
 
xecutive Officer of Tii a Inccr orated, Andrew
 was appointed
 
founding chairman of the President's Committee on Arts and Humanities
 
in 1982.  As a leader in promoting the Arts and Humanities, he
 
energetically, and I echo energetically, persuaded cultural leaders
 
and business executives to support cultural activities and
 
institutions.
 He filled a void in American life at a time when we
 
need him.  And today we thank him for that.
 Andrew Heiskell.
 
(
Applause.)
 
(Award is presented.)
 
There are a lot of funny people.
 He said, all this and
 
dinner, too?
 (Laughter.)

Historian Laurel T. Ulrich has introduced both scholarly
 
and public audiences to the lives of ordinary people in New England's
 
past.
 Her recent book "A Midwife's Tale:
 The Life of Martha
 
Ballard,  Based on Her Diary," won the 1991 Pulitzer Prize for
 
History,  among other honors.
 
Now that I have become President, perhaps I can say this
 
with greater authority than would otherwise be the case -
-
 we often
 
times tend to see our history too much through the lives and works of
 
the famous and n t  i
.:''f
t thr
gh the remirkab'.e lives of t'
 
who are not famous.
 She has made a truly significant contribution to
 
our understanding of our roots.
 And for that we thank her.
 
(Applause.)
 
(Award is presented.)
 
And now I have one last special honor,  and that is to
 
present to Congressman Sidney Yates the Presidential Citizens Medal
 
for his exemplary deeds of service in the area of arts and
 
humanities.
 The last time Congressman Yates was here for an occasion
 
at the White House,  it happened to be on the day he and his wife were
 
celebrating their 58th wedding anniversary.
 And today, we honor him
 
for that many years,  and more,  of dedication to our common cause.
 
Congressman Yates, please come forward.
 (Applause.)
 
(Medal is awarded.)
 
Again,  let me thank the honorees for being here today,
 
thank all of you in the audience who have come to support them and to
 
support the arts.
 
Before we go,  I just can't resist saying this.
 Just
 
before I came ou. nei.e,  i
 ied

 itc-
and a friend of Hillary's and mine's, Tony Morrison was awarded the
 
Nobel Prize for Literature today.
 (Applause.)
 I hope that in -the
 
years and struggles ahead we will work hard together to keep the arts
 
and humanities alive and flourishing -
-
 not just here in the nation's
 
capital or in the cultural capitals of this great land, but in every
 
community and in every neighborhood.
 
Remember,  all the people we honor today were once in an
 
ordinary community in an ordinary neighborhood living only with the
 
imagination they had that brought them to this day and this honor.
 
We have to find that imagination and fire it in the children all over
 
America.
 
Thank you all and God bless you.
 (Applause.)

I would like my brother Alan Lomax to escort me to the
 
afternoon awards  ceremony on the White House  lawn:
 
At the  lawn ceremonies  I
 would also like to have my sister,  my
 
two daughters and my son in law:
 
Shirley Duggan
 
Corey Hawes Denos
 
Naomi Hawes Bishop
 
John Melville Bishop
 
If there  is any possibility to have my four grandchildren
  
there as well,  it would of course be wonderful.  
Jesse Paul and Megan Kate Denos
  
Noah and Amanda Bishop
  
At the Library of Congress  luncheon,  I would like to have:
 
Noah Bishop
 
Amanda Bishop
 
Jesse Paul Denos
 
Megan Kate Denos
 
Pat Gordon
 
Carol Kulig
 
Anna Chairetakis
 
Lisa Ornstein Hawes
 
I wish my family weren't  so complicated,  but of course  I am
 
completely delighted that they are so happy for me as to pack
 
up their busy lives and take the  long trip to Washington.
 
Anything you can do to edge in another spot or two for any of
 
them would be enormously appreciated,  especially for the lawn
 
ceremony,  but  I will completely understand if no other spaces
 
become available.  What we have will work,  and thanks again
 
for always being so patient and pleasant.

Att:  Rosemary Cribben
 9/29/93
 
A nephew,  John Lomax III,  who had previously told me he
 
likely could not get away to attend the National Medal of
 
Arts doings,  called me  last night to say he had made
 
arrangements to be in Washington October 7 and 8.  I told him
 
it was now highly
 unlikely that he could attend any of the
 
formal occasions,  but that  I would put his name into the
 
hopper,  which I am now doing:
 
John Lomax III
 
757 Brownlee Drive
 
Nashville,  Tennessee
 37205
 
If by any wild chance an extra seat turns up for the luncheon
 
at the Library of Congress or the ceremony at the White House
 
grounds opens up,  I would appreciate  it very much if you
 
could slip his name into the Hawes pack.
 
One of these days  I hope  I will meet you so as to thank you
 
in person  for your patience and efficiency.

Dear Mrs.  Hawes:
 
While reading the enclosed remarks by the
 
President,  I was able to reflect on
 
yesterday's memorable events celebrating
 
your achievements.
 I wanted to add my
 
personal congratulations to the many
 
laudatory remarks you received during this
 
special day.
 
As a momento of the presentation ceremony,
 
I have enclosed a copy of the remarks by
 
the President.
 I will send photographs to
 
you in the near future.
 Again,  my
 
congratulations.
 
With best wishes,
 
Ann Stock
 
Social Secretary
