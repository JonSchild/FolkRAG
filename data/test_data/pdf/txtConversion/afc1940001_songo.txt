1878 [???]
"Song of the Flume"I sought the shore of the sounding seaFrom the far [Sierra's?] height.With a [stary
breast?] and a snow-capped crest,I [foamed in?] a path of light;But they bore me thence in a winding
way [md] They [fettered?] me like a slave,And as [serfs?] of old were sold for gold,So they bartered
my soil-stained wave.
starry
Lift me aloft to the mountain [browl.?][Fathom?] the deep blue vein!And I'll sift the soil for the
shining [soil?],As I sink to the valley again;The swell of my [starthy?] breast shall bearPebble and rock
away,Though they brave my strength, they shall yield at length,And the glittering gold shall stay.
