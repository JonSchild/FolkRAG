IAW-DD-AO10 
--opening announcement (interviewer gives date and name of informant) 
--when John's father came to America, the family name was Riale, not Royal; 
John's father's name was Archile Riale [sp?]; his brothers convinced him to 
"Americanize" his name to Archie Royal 
--John's father was from the province of Reggio Amelia [sp?], he was born in 
mountain town of Valvona [sp?]; it's in the mountains near Genoa 
--when Archie was a kid he worked as a sheepherder for his father, then got a 
job in the marble quarries in Carrara; his father didn't want him to work i 
the quarries, so he encourage Archie to join his brother (i.e., Archie's 
brother) in Pueblo, Colorado 
--Archie arrived in Pueblo in 1913 and found his brother there; his brother 
eventually returned to Italy and never came back to the United States; 
therefore, Archie was the only member of the family to remain in the U.S. 
--John not sure what brought Archie's brother to Pueblo; he had been there 7-
8 years before Archie joined him; probably he came over to work and send money 
back to the family in Italy 
--John recalls that his father used to talk about coming through Ellis Island; 
story about Archie traveling from New York to Pueblo by train and living on a 
bag of fruit he bought in New York; he arrived in Pueblo on the Fourth of 
July; the symbolism of his arrival on this American holiday was not lost on 
him [John's secretary brings in cups of coffee for John and Doug] 
--Archie's work in the marble quarries; "Yeah, he was just a kid. 
And the job 
he got, he was scaling the cliffs by rope and knocking off the loose chips of 
marble so it wouldn't fall down and kill the workers. 
And they had to 
communicate with him by flags, you know. 
And he'd swing from one cliff to the 
other and on the ledges and that. 
And his dad saw, found him the next spring 
what he was doing done there, and his dad fainted. 
He said, 'My god,' you 
know, 'you're going to kill yourself.' 
He said, 'Well, I don't want to go 
back up in the mountains and freeze, you know, in the winter time and ah herd 
sheep.' 
So his old man said, 'Well, if you don't want to come back and do 
that then go to America and find your brother.'" 
--the living conditions in Pueblo when Archie arrived; the conditions were 
bad; most of the men were bachelors and they lived in tents or shacks; mining 
companies controlled the towns; "It was like slave labor conditions, it was 
very, very bad" 
--Archie was involved in early efforts to form the mine workers' union; he was 
involved in 18-month strike in and around Pueblo and Trinidad, Colorado; the 
Ludlow Massacre occurred at this time; "And he went through that whole thing 
for about eighteen months. 
That's where they burnt down the company camp and 
killed thirteen women and kids and all that. 
So, he went through that whole 
era and it was very, very bad time. 
They had the militia on them, the 
Pinkertons, the guards, the sheriffs, the rangers. 
And these people, I guess, 
in many cases they just shot them on sight. 
And, you know, there was cases of 
lynching and dragging people through town with a rope behind a horse. 
And it 
was a real bad, bad time." 
--Archie worked in the coal mines, the moved to California in 1928 
--as a result of his involvement with organized labor, Archie came to hate 
symbols of authority (sheriffs, rangers, Pinkertons, etc.) because he had such 
brutal memories of them 
--illegal acts committed by striking miners out of desperation (during 
Colorado strike); "basically it was like a war" 
--John has book called Out of the Depths that is about Colorado miners' strike 
--Archie told John about discrimination he experienced as a kid; getting beat 
up because he was a foreigner; other ethnic groups were represented in the 
mines in addition to Italians 
--Archie worked in several mines (John's mother has a record of them at home); 
one mine was Victor Mining and Fuel Company; Archie and others worked in mines 
throughout southern Colorado; he may also have worked in Arizona and in 
Helper, Utah; "when they needed work they went where mines were hiring" 
--Archie told John that when you got a job in a mine they'd hold back 30 days 
of pay in order to keep miners from quitting early 
--Archie has a homestead near Mount Harris, Colorado, up in Wolf Creek Canyon; 
Klu Klux Klan tried to drive Italians out of the area; "they weren't going to 
tolerate any Italian people and/or Catholics in the area and they were going 
to burn them out"; Archie said most of the KKK members were local businessmen 
--foreigners were discriminated against, it was tough to survive; it was 
difficult for them to turn to local authorities because some probably 
supported discriminatory attitudes 
--Archie became very militant in support of the unions; he was a big strong 
man and other Italian miners looked up to him; his nickname was "Jumbo" 
because he had lifted the largest single piece of coal into a coal car; he had 
phenomenal strength; he was known as Jumbo in San Pedro, too 
--Archie became a "totally dedicated man of labor"; he "supported the union's 
activities to organize the working people and help them get a bigger piece of 
bread" 
--Archie arrived in Pueblo in 1913; the Ludlow Massacre was in 1917 or 1919 
(John is not sure of exact date) 
--Archie was involved in the first efforts to organize miners' union 
--after Archie got married, he obtained a 160 acre homestead near Mount 
Harris, CO; wife's family was living in the area; Archie did some farming, but 
also worked in the coal mines when they were open; life was tough because 
wages were low and working conditions in the mines were bad 
--Archie probably had to leave Colorado because "he got black-balled for his 
union activities" and "they had the law on him all the time"; consequently, he 
finally came to California; he originally planned to go to Canada, but family 
came to California because wife's sister lived in Wilmington, CA, and family 
went to visit 
--Archie and family arrived in Wilmington on Christmas Eve 1928; family 
included John's mother, father, three sisters and John (John was sic years old 
at the time); John was born in Colorado; 
Archie got a job working on a 
breakwater, the started working on the waterfront (as a longshoreman?); 
Archie's brother-in-law convinced him to stay in the area instead of moving to 
Canada 
--in 1933 and '34, Archie involved in another big strike in connection with 
the establishment of the longshoremen's and warehousemen's union under Harry 
Bridges 
--Archie went to jail following a big fight on the waterfront; he saw the 
birth of the International Longshoremen's Union; he saw improvements come to 
longshoring; he retired with a pension from the union in the 1960s; "He had 
the satisfaction of knowing that he probably done some good for the guys on 
the waterfront as well as the guys that followed" 
--John was born June 24, 1922; John's grandmother and aunt were midwives at 
his birth; there was no official record of John's birth; John had to go back 
to Colorado in order to establish official record of his birth; he learned 
that when he was two years old he was baptized in Steamboat Springs, CO, and 
given the name Giovanni Giuseppe Riale; in 1940, the family's name was 
officially changed to Royal (though the family had gone by the name Royal for 
many years); in retrospect, John wishes they had kept their original surname 
(Riale) because it's bothersome to have to explain to people that he is 
Italian with a name like Royal 
--John was about 11 years old when the longshoremen's union was being 
organized; John has clear memories of this period; recalls the time when his 
father and other men were in the Royal's wine cellar planning an attack on 
scabs who were in a "bull pen" provided by the steam ship companies; they were 
also making weapons (black jacks and billy clubs) 
--companies brought in scab laborers when longshoremen when on strike; scabs 
lived in a "bull pen"; the whole thing "got real nasty" and was a repeat of 
what Archie had been through in Colorado 
--story of striking longshoremen raiding the bull pen at night [fully told]; a 
neighbor (Dick Parker) was shot and killed by a detective 
--on the morning after the raid, police came and arrested Archie and took him 
to jail [very fully told]: 
"About four or five big touring cars pulled up at 
the house and they come and knocked on the door and I remember I was sleeping 
on a cot in the front room there and ah my mother went to open the door and 
they just knocked her down and come charging, about ten of them I guess, come 
charging right through the house. 
Went in the bedroom and grabbed my old man 
who was in bed. 
And they didn't even give him a chance, I guess, to dress up. 
He had long underwear on and they just handcuffed him and drug him out and 
threw him in the touring car and away they went. 
And it took us a couple of 
days to find out that they had him in Lincoln Heights Jail in Los Angeles. 
And he told me at that time, ah, that in the cell. 
He didn't talk much about 
it but they didn't have any facilities. 
They had a hole in the corner that 
you used as a toilet and I guess they had him shackled to a pad eye there, you 
know. 
And, ah, he never did tell me what really happened there, but I imagine 
that they probably worked him over pretty good for a couple days and nights. 
And then he finally got out. 
But some guys during that strike disappeared. 
They never did find them." 
--Archie stayed active in organized labor and helped form the longshoremen's 
union on the West Coast 
--the scene along San Pedro's waterfront when John was a boy; John used to 
sell newspapers in this area 
--John used to carry his father's lunch to him when he worked on Terminal 
Island; before the union was formed, men had to stayed on the ship until it 
was unloaded; in those days, men were "hired off the dock like animals"; they 
worked around the clock (there was no such thing as an eight-hour day); men 
were fired if they took too long at the toilet 
--the old procedure for hiring longshoremen; there used to be a blackball 
system 
--there was a lot of local sympathy for longshoremen when the strike was on; 
local people helped them with food and credit; a soup kitchen was formed; 
seamen went on strike with the longshoremen; single strikers ate in soup 
kitchens while married men were given food to take home to their families 
--Archie and other strikers went out to Santa Cruz Island in a fishing boat 
and shot wild goats and sheep and then brought them back to San Pedro; the 
meat was cut up in the soup kitchen 
--Archie "got a good indoctrination, a good lesson, I guess, in the labor 
movement and the, and the abuses the employers could, you know, put upon 
working people. 
Today, one finds it hard to imagine some of the things that 
really happened did happen." 
--John's career: 
he went into the Merchant Marines during World War II and 
then went into commercial fishing after the war; he was a navigator on tuna 
boats; in the 1940s, also fished for sardines out of San Francisco and 
Monterey and Moss Landing and San Pedro; fished for tuna off Mexico 
--John joined fishermen's union; at that time members were mainly Yugoslays; 
another union was made up mainly of Italian fishermen; the Yugoslays were the 
"distant water fishermen"; John got a job on the Yugoslav boats as a navigator 
and joined their union; he started to attend union meeting and began to voice 
his opinions about abuses; eventually, other members encouraged him to run for 
union offices; he has been in office since 1957 
--John's union activities; the fish canners were "just like" the mining 
companies; fishermen often became indebted to canneries because of loans made 
for boats and equipment; fishermen obligated to sell fish to canneries; 
canneries told fishermen that they shouldn't join the union 
--canneries "put fear into fishermen" about joining the union; vote to form 
the union lost by a very small margin 
--canneries financed fishing boats; canneries had different levels of 
ownership; sometimes they owned the whole boat, sometimes a partial ownership 
--the canneries dictated the price of fish to the fishermen; the fishermen 
"were captivated victims, really" 
--fishermen often went to canneries to obtain financing to purchase new and 
used boats; the fishermen "had a yoke around their neck from then on" 
--the union discovered that the canneries were cheating fishermen on the 
weight of fish--the scales were adjusted to show a lower weight; the union 
took the canneries to court over this issue; as a result, John was blackballed 
from the fishing industry 
--the practices of the canneries were reminiscent of the practices of the coal 
mine companies: 
"It was a repeat of what my dad told me happened in the coal 
mines." 
John took action to correct things: 
"And so I told the guys we had 
to get together. 
And he did. 
And we assessed ourselves and we put a union 
man on the scales to watch the company man. 
And when we did that we found 
that the fish boats increased their carrying capacity by anywhere from 15 to 
25 percent per load. 
So then they took us to court--me included--and they 
said we were a bunch of Communists and it was restraint of trade and 
collusion. 
And it was real bad." 
--the judge ordered the canneries to open their books to the union's lawyers 
for 10 days; because of the number of boats involved, a thorough accounting 
was not possible, but a spot check revealed that over 10 million dollars worth 
of fish had been stolen from fishermen over the years 
--consequently, the canneries dropped their law suits against the union 
[End of side one of tape IAW-DD-A010, interview continued on side 2.] 
--John spent two years working for the acceptance of a single fishermen's 
union in San Pedro, but the vote was not favorable 
--because of his involvement with the union, John became a persona non grata, 
and couldn't find work on fishing boats, even though he was an experienced 
navigator and had many other skills besides; "the men liked me but the owners 
were scared to hire me because of the pressure behind the scenes, I guess, 
from the canners." 
--John found work as an "extra" in the longshoring trade; eventually he got 
into the longshoremen's union; he was elected to the executive board of the 
union 
--the longshoremen's union got into a jurisdictional dispute with another 
union; in July of 1950, the International Fishermen's and Allied Workers' 
Union merged with the longshoremen's union; local union people went to see 
harry Bridges in San Francisco and told him they were being raided by the AFL-
CIO and were having trouble with the canners, too; Bridges and others 
convinced John to return to the fishermen's union and try to help the 
fishermen; John left the longshoremen's union and worked as an international 
representative to help the fishermen; subsequently, the members of the 
fishermen's union elected John to office; John has been with the fishermen's 
union ever since 
--improvements that have occurred since John rejoined the union include: 
a 
pension plan, a health and welfare plan, better conditions, better weights and 
measures ("we have a union man on the scales to police the unloading") 
--during the last few years the fishing industry has "died" because the 
canners moved overseas (American Samoa, Puerto Rico, etc.); one cannery 
remains on Terminal Island 
--the tuna industry started in San Pedro at the turn of the century 
--actually, there are two canneries in the area today: 
a mackerel cannery 
(founded by Starkist Tuna) that was purchased by the boat owners two years 
ago; another cannery--International Protein (formerly Pan-Pacific Canneries) 
cans tuna and mackerel, but mainly tuna; International Protein is the last 
tuna cannery in the United States 
--there used to be a dozen tuna canneries between San Pedro and Long Beach, 
and there used to be 4-5 in San Diego 
--when John's was active in the longshoremen's union, his home was one of the 
centers of union activity by Italian longshoremen; Archie "because a spokesman 
or a leader because of his militancy among that particular ethnic group"; some 
Mexican-Americans worked in local lumber yards, a few also were longshoremen; 
Finns, Norwegians, and Swedes were also union members 
--Italian longshoremen would often come to house to have meetings; sometimes 
meeting were held in the wine cellar; "There was always some activity going 
on, you know. 
Some was legal, some wasn't. 
It was a battle of survival, I 
guess, know." 
--Doug recalls that organization of textile workers in Patterson, N.J., 
sometimes took place at a bocce court 
--John remembers that his father and others "would find ways of camouflaging 
their meetings. 
Because the police would always come around, and the 
detectives they were coming around harassing them, you know. 
And they'd see 
them in groups, they'd bust them up, you know, or take them down and throw 
them in jail." 
--in order to camouflage union meetings, men would meet secretly in private 
homes, or in parks, as if they were having a picnic or a family; police used 
to follow Archie around and stake out his home; police used to look for 
excuses to harass union organizers 
--when the strike was in progress, Archie and others used whatever means was 
necessary to convince men not to break the strike 
--the strikers held on and won the strike 
--previous attempts by seamen and longshoremen to win strikes had not been 
successful 
--when longshoremen's strike was settled, Bridges refused to go back to work 
until the seaman were taken care of; the seamen never forgot this; 
consequently the seamen and the longshoremen became strong allies 
--reasons by Yugoslav fishermen fished further offshore than Italians; in the 
old country, Italians fished with lampara nets; a lot of the Yugoslays came 
through Canada, down to Bellingham, WA, and finally down to San Pedro in the 
early part of the 20th century; the Yugoslays developed the purse seine 
fishing technique; the Italians (who were in the minority at that time) fished 
with lampara nets and later went into purse seining 
--all local fishermen fished for sardines, mackerel, squid, etc., and for 
bluefin tuna (that came up the coast from Mexico in the summer months); the 
Yugoslays were the first to take purse seiners to Mexico to fish for tuna 
--in the old days, fishing boats carried fish to cool their catches; living 
conditions on board were not as good as they are today [examples given] 
--in fishing, "it's strange how the ethnic groups gravitated toward the same 
latitudes where they came from the in old country. 
All of the Norwegians and 
the Danes and the Swedes gravitated to Alaska and Canada and Seattle, 
Washington; cold climates. 
And ah, and ah the Italians gravitated from the 
east coast into ah San Francisco and Monterey and down here and in San Diego. 
And then the Portuguese came in from the old country and they were heavy, I 
guess, in Massachusetts, and then they came out here. 
Some to San Pedro, then 
they gravitated to San Diego 
[additional details on the ethnic composition 
of west coast fisheries] 
--the Portuguese fished with pole and line, they used poles with artificial 
lures to catch tuna; in 1957, the Portuguese began to convert their "bait 
boats" over to purse seining; Portuguese hired Italian and Yugoslav fishermen 
from San Pedro to teach them about purse seining; later, the Portuguese went 
on to build bigger and better purse seiners; the cost and size of big seiners 
today 
--changes in fishing technology: 
purse rope replaced by cable; the power 
block was invented by Mario Puretic [sp?]; John used to fish with Mario; the 
power block replaced muscle power for hauling nets; the process of hauling a 
net by hand [fully described]; John uses Yugoslav phrase that means "haul the 
net" 
--another improvement was the introduction of new refrigeration systems, 
including the brine system; the development of the hydraulic system was also a 
significant improvement 
--the development of new technology made the development of big fishing boats 
possible 
--introduction of nylon nets (which replaced cotton nets) was another 
improvement 
--the Portuguese are the long distance fishermen, even to a greater extent 
than the Yugoslays; the Italian fishermen preferred to stay closer to home, in 
general they were coastal fishermen 
--John was one of the first non-Yugoslays to fish on a Yugoslav boat; he was 
one of the first to break the ethnic barrier; before World War II, there were 
three ethnic groups in the fishing fleet--Japanese, Italians, and Yugoslays; 
after World War II very few Japanese returned to the fishery 
--one of the problems that John had in trying to organize the fishermen was 
that there was a strong enmity between Italians and Yugoslays because of the 
battle of Trieste 
--differences between Italians and Yugoslays with regard to religion; both 
were Catholic, but Italian men went to church with their families and Yugoslav 
men let their wives go to church alone 
--little by little Italians and Yugoslays got closer; the taboo about inter-
marriage was broken; after World War II relations got much better between the 
groups 
--today, fishing boats crews are ethnically mixed in many cases; in the past 
crews consisted of strictly one ethnic group 
--story about how John first got a job on a Yugoslav fishing boat [John speaks 
a phrase in Yugoslav]; some people in San Pedro have come to believe that John 
is of Yugoslav descent; names of some local Yugoslav families 
--sometimes John left crews when he didn't get along with other crew members 
--over the years inter-ethnic hatred has diminished substantially; in recent 
years, there has been a second migration of fishermen from Sicily; this second 
wave began about 20 years ago 
--today, there are two Yugoslav skippers in San Pedro; in the past, the 
skippers were predominantly Yugoslays; today, most skippers are Sicilians and 
Ischitans because of the second migration 
--the canneries exploited the ethnic rivalries of the fishermen; canneries 
helped the AFL-CIO; according to John, the AFL-CIO was a "company union"; the 
canners would favor boat owners that brought fishermen from the old country 
and got them to join the AFL-CIO 
--the Yugoslays were more militant than the Italians 
--John's family background motivated him to speak up about labor issues: 
"I 
learned about labor ever since I was old enough to sit at the kitchen table 
and have a bowl of soup with the old man as a kid. 
I was raised in a strong 
union home and labor house. 
But I never thought I'd wind up in labor movement 
as per se, but I guess water seeks it level and gravitates somehow." 
--John could compare his father's stories of conditions workers faced in the 
coal mines with current conditions fishermen faced: 
"I think a lot of the 
stuff I found here was a repeat of the stories my dad told me happened in the 
coal mines. 
And I got the idea of putting a union man on the fish scales 
because that's what they did in the coal mines. 
The coal miners put a union 
man on the scales because when they'd bring a car-load of coal out of the 
thing that weighed two thousand pounds, so then if they put four thousand 
pounds on the coal car it still weighed two thousand pounds. 
And they found 
that they put railroad ties under the scales so the scale would only come 
down, the load of coal would only come down to two thousand pounds and stop 
I got the idea of putting a union man on the fish scales against the 
canners at the time the boats were unloading from the story my old man told me 
about them putting a union man on the scales at the mines." 
--the values John learned in his family: 
"I've been raised and indoctrinated, 
I guess, as to being ah very cognizant of the rights of working people and 
objecting to the abuses and exploitation of working people . . . . Without me 
realizing I find myself getting up and raising hell and complaining about 
stuff 
" 
--John's ambitions when he was young: 
he wanted to go back to Colorado and 
get into cattle ranching; John used to go back to Colorado when he was a kid 
and visit his uncles and his cousins; he loved the Rockies 
--in the early days of fishing, employers exploited bad feelings between 
ethnic groups; they played one against the other; companies played favorites 
--the union has enabled the fishermen to obtain many benefits 
--the union still finds that companies try to cheat the fishing crews 
--in the past, the union threatened to tied up the boats if companies didn't 
make certain changes 
--the local fishing industry is dying; the fishing fleet now consists mainly 
of about 30 mackerel boats; John hopes for resurgence of sardine fishery 
--in recent years, John has been involved with state politics--monitoring 
legislature that relates to commercial fishing 
--John has served as a member of several international fishery commissions; he 
is the vice president of the Pacific Fishery Development Foundation; he was 
appointed to the L.A. Harbor Commission (the first member from labor); 
received a presidential appointment from President Nixon ; 
John is a life-
long Democrat, so he thinks he was appointed as the "token Democrat"; he feels 
he has the experience to service on these commissions, experience that 
political appointees do not have 
[end of IAW-DD-A010, interview continued on IAW-DD-A001] 
[IAW-DD-A011: the continuation of the July 25, 1989, interview with John Royal 
of San Pedro, California. 
The interviewer is Douglas DeNatale.] 
--enmity that arose from competition for fish was not something that was 
reserved for only for fishermen of different ethnic groups; competition also 
engendered bad feelings between fishermen of the same ethnic group 
--Yugoslays tends to fish further offshore than Italians 
--there is some optimism that the sardine fishery will make a come-back; John 
thinks the sardine quota should be raised; research is being conducted in 
order to provide Fish & Game Commission with facts that support raising of 
quota 
--in the past, sardines were always for human consumption while anchovies were 
made into fish meal, and feed for poultry and for fish raised in hatcheries 
--the resurgence of the sardine fishery "would be a tremendous shot in the arm 
for this fleet" 
--in the past, when the sardine fishery was in its hey-day, 750,000 tons a 
year were landed in California; fishing boats were loaded down with catches of 
sardines; over at Fish Harbor (Terminal Island), where the canneries used to 
be, "you could walk across the whole harbor from boat to boat there waiting 
for them to unload." 
--in the past, sardines were unloaded by hand; today, big suction pumps are 
used and can do the work in 40 minutes that it used to take men hours to do by 
hand 
--conflict between fishermen and biologists with regard to estimating the 
strength of fish stocks; "the biologists have always been ultra-conservative"; 
the fishermen's union has hired outside biologists to show that the Fish & 
Game Commission's estimates were way off 
--in the early '50s, when the sardine fishery began to decline, some 
attributed this to over-fishing; however, a respected biologist hypothesized 
that the decline was a result of cyclical migratory patterns 
--as the law now stands, a 1,000 ton quota on sardine is in effect; however, a 
15% by-catch of sardines is permitted with catches of mackerel; John would 
like to see a 35% by-catch allowance; if boats exceed the by-catch, they must 
dump the extra sardines overboard 
--recently, John was able to obtain $200,000 to continue sardine research 
--the size of the fishing fleet in San Pedro: in the past there used to be 150 
boats; now there are about 30 boats 
--when the sardine fishing season opened up in the San Pedro area, boats from 
further north (Monterey, San Francisco, Washington State) would come down and 
there would be 400 boats in San Pedro; "It was a hub of activity: 
ten of 
twelve canneries working day and night. 
15,000 cannery workers."; this was in 
the 1930s and 1940s and early 1950s 
--John thinks the current fleet is operated by Sicilian and Ischian fishermen 
who came during the second wave of immigration 
--not many Yugoslays coming over any more; there was a big influx of Yugoslays 
right after World War II; after they made money fishing, most Yugoslays got 
out of fishing and went into other types of business throughout the local 
economy 
--at one time, fishing was "strictly a father and son tradition" but many 
fathers began to encourage their sons to get education and go into other lines 
of work; fishermen didn't see a real future in fishing for their sons 
--many Italians have gone into the restaurant business; many of them come from 
fishing families 
--some Italians have gone into real estate and have "done very well"; Libby 
DiBernardo, Tony Marino, Frank Lauro, and Tony Califano have done well as real 
estate brokers 
--San Pedro's Italian community hangs together "more so than most 
communities"; however, one of the problems has been that Italians never had a 
club of their own 
--John used to be a member of the Mazzini Club; the club "disintegrated" as 
the old timers died off and young people went in other directions 
--the Mazzini Club was named after Giuseppe Mazzini, an Italian who worked to 
bring groups of Italians together in Italy 
--other local clubs: 
the Sons of Italy, the Colombo Club, the Italian-
American Club. 
John feels that one strong club would be better than several 
small clubs. 
He doesn't feel that current Italian clubs in San Pedro approach 
the strength of the local Yugoslav club; local Italians seem to be quite 
fragmented in comparison; "I still feel that if these guys would just get 
together and form a good Italian-American club, you know, and get rid of this 
difference between the dialects, you know." 
--John thinks solidity would give Italians the political clout and strength to 
preserve their culture and identity 
--the Mazzini Club used to rent the Knights of Columbus Hall; it didn't have 
its own facility

First 
of all you have to be, through marriage, you know, in order to get in. 
Now 
they've got judges and they've got people in there you are neither Italian or 
Yugo-. 
They're everything, but they're not Italians or their wives are not 
Italian. 
But it's a fun club. 
It's a good club. 
They do a lot of good 
work." 
--John is the current president of the D.B. Club: 
"Like I told them when they 
installed me last January. 
I told them, I said, 'I, I have mixed emotions,' I 
said, 'all my life I grew up and,' I said, 
'I got my nose broke fourteen times 
when somebody called me a dago bastard or a foreign extraction son-of-a-bitch 
or something like that,' I said. 
'And now,' I said, 
'I, I'm up here taking 
vows and ah, and I considered it a great honor to become the president of the 
Dago Bastards. 
I don't know how to rationalize it.' 
And they laughed like 
hell, you know."
