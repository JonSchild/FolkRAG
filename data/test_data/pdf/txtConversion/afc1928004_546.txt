MY MELINDA. 
END SONG. 
Sung with great success by ED. C. 
SMITH, of SMITH and LEOPOLD. 
THE first time I 
met her, 
I 
never shall forget 
She took my alabaster brow 
And pressed it to her lips, 
And then she whispered loudly, 
" 
You're such a 
handsome chap 
But she broke my new suspenders 
When she sat down on my lap. 
CHORUS. 
Then good-bye, Melinda, 
Don't you cry for me, 
For I'm going away to leave you% 
Way down in Tennessee ; 
But I'll be back again, my love, 
When the corn is on the ear ; 
Then play on the old jawbone once more, 
My own Melinda dear. 
Her nose is like a 
beer barrel 
And her shoulders like a 
ham, 
Her ear is like a 
hoe-cake, 
And her mouth is like a 
clam ; 
She's seven feet high and over, 
And her hair is awful red, 
And she has to get upon a 
chair 
When she wants to scratch her head. 
Then good-bye, etc. 
I 
wish I 
was a 
little corn, 
Upon Melinda's toe, 
And then no matter where she went 
I'd be quite sure to go ; 
Or else an alligator, 
And when she went to swim, 
Open wide my alligate 
And take Melinda in. 
Then good-bye, etc.

\THERE the water lilies grow, 
And the zephyrs gently blow, 
Where the waters softly flow, 
Meet me, darling Annie! 
When the whippoorwill cloth call, 
And the dewdrops softly fall, 
While the moon shines over all, 
Kiss me, darling Annie ! 
CHORUS. 
When- 
the flowers fall asleep, 
Aiid the moon shines o'er the deep, 
Tell me I 
your heart may keep, 
Then, my darling Annie ! 
Harken to the turtle dove, 
Cooing from his nest above, 
Lisrning to the tale of love, 
Whisper'd unto Annie ! 
How he envies me the bliss, 
Pressing such a 
form as this, 
How he wishes he might kiss 
Your sweet lips, my Annie ! 
When the flowers, etc. 
While the little stars do shine, 
Place your snowy hand in mine, 
Whisper softly, " I'll be thine," 
Now, my darling Annie ! 
From the clouds the moonbeams break, 
Show'ring silver o'er the lake, 
List'ning to the vows I 
take, 
From you, darling Annie! 
When the flowers, etc. 
ONE MORE RIVER TO CROSS. 
Sung by CHAS. GOODYEAR, with great success. 
SHOUT, children, you am free, 
One more river to cross; 
Oh, the sogers give you liberty, 
One more river to cross ; 
Oh, four eleven forty four, 
One more river to aross; 
That's the number now that comes no more, 
One more river to cross. 
CHORUS. 
Den a 
wasent that a 
wide river, 
River of Jordan's strand. 
Wide river, one more river to cross. 
Some go to church for to sing and laugh, 
One more river to cross; 
Dey think they knew all, but didn't know half, 
One more river to cross ; 
Some go to church for to sing and shout, 
One more river to cross ; 
In abolit six months dey get kicked out, 
One more river to cross. 
Den a

JANE OVERSHOE. 
PARODY ON NANCY LEE. 
Written by JAMES NILES. 
Sung with big success by NILES and 
EVANS. 
OF 
all the dizzy girls that ever I 
knew, 
There's none can compare with Jane Overshoe. 
Her nose is long, and her mouth is large, 
She is always good to herself ; 
She can eat clam pies, that for a 
year was laid on the 
shelf. 
One Saturday night I 
got my pay, 
I 
took her out for a 
walk ; 
To a 
beer-saloon at first we went, 
But the man to death she talked : 
A 
freezer full of ice-cream 
To her was only a 
taste, 
Then fourteen oyster stews she laid waste. 
cnont-s. 
Oh, my, did you ever see such a 
girl before., 
She ate till she fell on the floor, 
Then I 
run out of the door ; 
I 
left her there to pay the bill ; 
Now what could I 
do more ? 
I'm sure my dream of love is o'er. 
To balls and parties we often go, 
Ye-ho, boys ! ho I 
for Jane Overshoe ; 
She is like the rest, she wants the best 
Or else it will not do, 
And your pocket-book she will go clear through. 
When I 
call for wine, she says she's mine, 
And to me she will be true : 
But when she has to pay the bill, 
It makes her feel so blue : 
She can waltz, polka, and quadrille 
For hours at a 
time ; 
Oh, this darling she never can be mine. 
Oh, my, did you ever, etc. 
I 
dare say you think now that strange it appears, 
To see a 
comedian \rho is nearly in tears; 
But when my sad story I 
pour in your ears, 
Perhaps you will pity my woes. 
It's on a 
young damsel I 
fondly did doat— 
No charmer more fairer than she. 
She fancied the stage, but cult not sing a 
note, 
So she came to take lessons from me— do, re, mi. 
CHORUS. 
To music halls nightly this damsel would go, 
And listen to Robinson, who enchanted her su , 
But DOW she's got married, and lives in a 
place I 
don't know, 
With a 
fellow who plays the banjo. 
hearing me sing the " Bohemian Swell," 
She head- over-ears in love with me fell. 
In less than three weeks she knew all her note, well, 
Such attention I 
to her had paid. 
All the new ladies' songs that were published I 
bought; 
I 
bought her stage properties new : 
For she by this time to perfection was brought, 
And soon was to make her debut. 
To music halls nightly, 14.e. 
Now, I 
asked a 
young fellow I 
happened to know, 
He being rather clever upon the banjo; 
And as I 
to the country for a 
week had to go, 
To perform My town diii es for me. 
He promised, and I 
on my journey did start— 
Canto back, and found to my dismay. 
That he with his banjo had so charmed her heart. 
That with him she skedaddled away. 
To music halls nightly, Szt• 
I 
ne'er saw her more after that night— 
I 
ne'er saw her more, thought I 
searched left and right. 
And I 
was laid up seven weeks through the flight, 
The news it so played on my nerves. 
As I 
was ont strolling one -very fine day, 
I 
turned round to hear music tones. 
Saw this chap with his banjo was tuning away, 
While my darling was shaking the " bones " 
To music halls nightly, 
2,gainst this young fellow a 
grudge I 
do owe— 
Ile did very wrong n 
serving nte : 
Anil also a 
grudge against his banjo— 
And I 
lope it won't keep in tune. 
I 
hope. who, he plays. that the bridge will break down 
And knock a 
big bole in the skin ; 
And I 
also hope, when they go through the town, 
That they don't get one cent of tin. 
To music halls nigittky.

BROTHERS 
DOWN by a 
cool and shady streamlef, 
Where the water lilies grow so green, 
There dwells a 
lovely maiden 
In an ivy cot unseen ; 
She was gathering the flowers in the wildwood, 
Down by a 
little golden stream, 
Where both our hearts beat just as one, 
Where the ivy grows so green. 
CII01ZUS. 
Oh ! darling Sue, this aching heart, (
Symph.) 
One more kiss before we part. 
(
Symph.) 
She was gathering the flowers in the wildwood, 
Down by a 
little golden stream, 
Where both our hearts spoke just as one, 
Where the ivy grows so green. 
(
Dance.) 
And at night when the little stars were sleeping, 
And the leaves were falling off the trees, 
We sat beside the brooklet, 
In the cool and shady breeze ; 
And when I 
asked her to be mine, 
Her pretty little eyes she tried to screen ; 
'Twas then I 
knew my fate was sealed, 
Where the ivy grows so green. 
Oh ! darling Sue, etc. 
HELP A MAN UP. 
Written and composed by ED. C. 
SMITH, and sung with tremen-
&us success by M ISS M AY VERNON in the principal Novelty 
Theatres of America. 
xi 
I'VE seen a 
great deal of this world in my time— 
This world of hardship and woe— 
Of people, all classes, both poor and the rich, 
But there's one thing I 
would like to know: 
How it is that a 
man, when he's down in the world, 
Is looked upon then with a 
frown, 
Why people will talk, but won't give their aid. 
- 
To help this man up when he's down ? 
CHORUS. 
Now, don't despise a 
man because he wears a 
ragged coat; 
There's an honest heart beneath it, I am bound; 
Thrice blessed be the man that will lend a 
helping hand, 
And help a 
poor man up when he's down. 
Now, there's the poor working mechanic, 
Toiling bravely from morn until night, 
Struggling hard to earn food for his loved ones, 
Who perhaps may be starving outright; 
His clothes they are plain—sometimes ragged, 
But don't pass him by with a 
frown: 
Just speak a 
kind word, 'twon't cost you a 
cent, 
'Twill cheer a 
man up when he's down. 
Now, don't, etc. 
This world at the best is a 
hard one, 
'Tis full of temptation and strife; 
We all have our cares and our sorrows 
As we journey along through tins life. 
4 -Should you meet a 
poor man in misfortune, 
Don't sneer, but a 
helping hand lend; 
We've but one life to live, and mark my words, 
You'll get your reward in the end. 
Now, don't, .4;c.

CI 10111'S. 
She was just the sort of creature that Nature did intend 
To walk strat“-ht through the world without the Grecian bend, 
Nor did she wear a 
chignon -- 1'd have you all to know 
That I 
met her in the garden where the praties grow. 
She was singing an ould Irish song, called " Gra gal ma-
chree," 
Oh, says I. what a 
wife she'd make for an Irish boy like me ; 
I 
was on important business, but I 
did not like to go 
And leave the girl or the garden where the 'males grow. 
She was just, etc. 
Says I, " My lovely, fair maid, I 
hope you'll pardon me;" 
But she wasn't like those city girls that would say, " You'rt 
making free ;" 
She answered right modestly, and curtsied very low, 
Saying, " You're -welcome to the garden where the praties 
grow." 
She was just, etc. 
Says I, " My lovely darling. I'm tired of single life, 
And if you have no objection I'll make you my dear wife ;" 
Says she, " I'll ax my parents, and to-morrow I'll let you 
know, 
If you meet me in the garden where the !wades grow." 
Site wess just, etc. 
Now her parents they consented, and we're blessed with chil-
dr•'n ti iree— 
Two girls like their mammy, and a 
boy the image of me; 
I'll train up the children in the way they should go, 
Bat I'll ne'er forget the garden where the praties grow. 
She was just, etc.

A CONGLOMERATION. 
Delivered with great force by HENRY LEOPOLD. 
M Y benighted hearers and fellow-candidates for the 
poor-house : It is with extreme feelings and sensations of 
the greatest obsquashituditiveinesses and undegenerated 
absquatulations, that I 
have the audacity and cohesive 
superlativeness to undress so large and such an intelli-
gent concourse of unmitigated and undegenerated body 
of unsemicivilized barbarians. 
And speaking as I 
were, and referring to the unquali-
fied voters and precipitators of this civil service reform 
that everywhere greets our intellectual visions, now when-
ever I 
am solicited to expound these antediluvian facts so 
well, and I 
may say so unfavorably cognizant to the as-
sembled galoots and dilapidated specimens of this segues-
tred hamlet, the theme and popular tenor of which it is 
useless, yes, useless, to expound. 
Why, my fellow-aspirants for the Senate Chamber and 
Members of Congress in general, the time is not very 
subsequently or numerously distant in the perspective 
stereoscope of our immortal futurities or disconnected un-
certainties when we can look back and say, as we did in 
the good old days of Adam and of Eve—in these Wendell 
Phillips would have denied the assertion. 
Again, we may collapse ourselves in a 
measure (a 
peck 
measure, for instance), but let us return to this great and 
overwhelming superstition of diabolical intemperance. 
Why, my unsophisticated emblems of unexampled stu-
pidities, the very gyrations of tins discordant and patent 
rights of imported nobilities, which is in a 
great degree 
elucidated and prolonged to the stupendous and glorious 
subject now under discussion, which is in our minds sim-
ply obnoxious and consolidated reports of our Water 
Board Commissioners. 
But again, and not again seventldy, does not this con-
glomeration of amalgamated forces of diophononiseses in 
a 
great degree seem to us to analyze all political remoni-
(

A CONGLOMERATION.—Concluded. 
zensations in a 
more superior manner than it would if it 
were not so opportunely cognizant of the delinequent 
circumstances of tlee promulgated forces of our hetroge-
nioseses of our consecremated diversities. 
But let us return to the beginning, or in other words, 
to our know-nothing subject, which in futurity is unex-
celled. 
Now, when the Committee on Finances and the 
general jurisprudence abolished the Free Whiskey Bureau, 
and the uninitiated demagogues of the sinew and mag-
nitude of the surrounding circumstances which brought 
together all the common sewer delegations into one mag-
nificent, overraptured array of discordant feelings, which 
was promulgated into one stupendous baud of dilapida-
tions. 
Secondly, does not the phosphates of the second de-
gree of emancipation—that is if you know anything of 
what has been spoken about. 
The subject entirely lays 
with you if you had seen the difficulties of this esteemed 
palpitated-tations of the gyrations of the critical fore-
thoughts, which is, and positively conducted on the prin-
ciples of—well, anything we might say now, my hypo-
critical antecedents and abglinated roosters of dilapidated 
humanities, you will never know the difference between 
the previously mentioned inferences of the resumption or 
consumption of specie basis in a 
more definite manner than 
if we were to consign ourselves to a 
more rigid speculation 
of the Treasury Department; but that has nothing to do 
with the death of our mother-in-law, which, as some 
thought, would have brought this matter to an infinitive 
mode of expiration, but it went on just the same. Why ? 
Because business is always to be noted before pleasure, 
thinking that the above few words will be the rendvinons 
of a 
succeeding aspiration of milder forethoughts. 
But 
where, yes, where were the Hebrew children all this time? 
Multum in Parvo. 
E 
Unit, E 
Pluribum. 
With a 
smiling gratitude. I 
bid thee farewell.

THERE'S a 
girl of sweet sixteen, 
Who is all the world to me ; 
She's a 
little fairy queen, 
Just as dear as dear can be ! 
Oft I 
linger, long and late, 
By her little cottage gate; 
When I 
turn to go away, 
Oh ! how sweetly she will say,— 
CHORUS. 
Come again some other night, 
Come just after candlelight 1 
Now I 
really think you might 
Come again some other night 1 
In the moonlight, when we part, 
Oft I 
hold her to my heart, 
Breathing words of fondest love, 
'Neath the shining stars above. 
Roses, sleeping, never hear 
What I 
whisper in her ear ; 
Sweetly smiling, she does say, 
As I 
leave her side to stray,— 
Come again, etc. 
There's a 
nest among the flow'rs, 
Where, in others happy hours, 
We will ever fondly dwell, 
the bliss of wedlock's spell 
Not a 
pain or thought of care 
Shall I 
find to grieve me there ; 
In those hours of life's sweet May, 
There will be no need to say, 
Come again, etc.

YOU CAN: DO IT IF YOU WANT TO.

HART.

York.

I 
ONCE was deep in love with a 
charming little dear, 
And when in her society I 
always felt so queer, 
muster'd up. my cheek, and asked her for a 
kiss. 
She blush'd and hesitated, and answered me like this : 
clloans. 
You can do it if you want to, 
For I 
really can't resist you, 
You are such a 
charming fellow, 
To refuse you is absurd. 
As time pass'd on, I 
found I'd have to get a 
wife, 
I 
ask'd her if she'd like to be my better half thro' life 7 
Her answer it was yes, so to papa I 
went, 
And as I'd money plenty, why, he quickly gave consent. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, I 
was pretty well fixed, as I 
asked the " Old 
Gent" for his daughter's han .1, heart, and so forth, and he says : 
" 
Well, I've no objection of ,2ourse; you know " Galatea" hasn't 
any money—but as long a9, you love her, why, that don't make 
any difference— and as to .,iarrying her, my dear boy, why 
You can do it, etc. 
I 
went with rapid step to tell her of' my plan, 
And found her sitting on the lap of a 
handsome looking man, 
I 
scarce believ'd my eyes and started with dismay, 
And as he whispered in her ear, I 
plainly heard her say— 
SroKEN.—" Never mind, Charley ; even if I 
do marry that 
" 
Snoozer," it won't make any difference, I'll love you just the 
same as ever." 
ieems-es River ! wasn't I 
mad—I 
told her she 
was false to me, and that I 
never would marry her—that I 
would 
not believe her even i 
she'd make a 
statement—and as for her 
" 
Charley," why, he could have her and welcome. I 
told her I 
would leave, and she should hover set eyes on me again—and 
'• I : lope. I 
may never " if she didn't say— 
You can do it, etc. 
The moral of my tale you all can plainly see, 
Don't marry any (rid, my boys, tho' handsome she may be, 
Unless she loves but you, I (-mess you'll find I'm riiht, 
They're bound to have a " Charley" when you are out ol sight. 
SPOKEN. — Yes, and all I've got to say is, if any of you chaps 
want to marry such a 
girl as that, why— 
You can rho it, etc.

THE FLAGS OF OUR NATIONS. 
Written and composed by ED. C. 
SMITH and dedicated to my 
wife, " Miss MAY VERNON," and sung with tremendous suc-
cess by her in the leading Novelty Theatres. 
The music of this song is published by GEO. D. 
NEWHALL & CO., 
Cincinnati, 0. 
Price 40 cents. 
PLEASE give me your attention, while I 
sing a 
little song 
About the glorious flags in our great world; 
The ones I 
have selected and present before your gaze 
You'll recognize as soon as they're unfurled. 
The first one I 
present to you is known to ev'ry one— 
'Tis the German flag, that's floated many a 
day; 
Its sight is always welcome to the suffering and oppressed: 
I'm sure you'll all agree to what I 
say. 
GERMANY. 
Then here is the flag of Germany— 
A 
flag that's not tarnished by a 
stain; 
It is dear to ev'ry one from that country o'er the sea, 
And the world has rung and echoed with its fame. 
There is a 
little island far across the deep blue sea 
Loved by ev'ry Irish heart throughout the laud; 
Many years she's been oppressed by a 
country there 
close by, . 
But still they can't defeat that little band. 
Its oppressors are a 
brutal set, who try to grind it down; 
They don't seem to recognize the God on high; 
But mark my words: ere long, that little isle so green 
Will conquer, for they never will say die. 
IRELAND. 
Then here is the flag of Ireland, 
The little isle where shamrock grows so green, 
And ev'ry true, brave Irish heart, no matter where it be, 
Will beat with joy whene'er its folds are seen. 
(1)

THE FLAGS OF OUR NATIONS.—Ooncluded. 
THERE iS still another flag, that I 
now will sing about, - 
That is known to ev'ry country in this world— 
'Tis the glorious Stars and Stripes, that is dear to ev'ry 
man, 
And we're ever proud to see that flag unfurled. 
Its defenders are a 
brave lot, who never fear defeat, 
No matter where they are—on land or sea; 
Justice is our motto, do right to one and all— 
Three cheers for that flag so brave and free. 
AMERICA. 
Then here is our national emblem, 
A 
flag that is loved by ev'ry one, 
And one and all beneath it will cherish and respect 
The name of brave and good George Washington. 
SHOUT AND SING. 
Written and composed by JERRY CUNNINGHAM, and sung with 
great applause by him at the Academy of Music, Toledo, 0.

Whose muse was decittediy good and propitious, 
He

And nightly urew plaudits from the gods at the show.

The artists, too, laughed at hi s puns o'er and o'er, 
But sad his misfortune and bitterest of pills, 
His name wasn't large on the regular bills. 
CHORUS . 
The ballet girls adored him and stood in the. wings, 
While he tuned his banjo and said funny things; 
But sad his misfortune and bitterest of pills, 
His name wasn't large on the regular bills. 
His fame kept increlsing- throughout all the land 
And scores of new friend: he shook by the hand, 
The dailies too praised him in articles long, 
For his manipulations of banjo and song. 
Then resolving to be in the profession a

" 
RING down the curtain ! " the last act is o'er, 
The sad play of life is now past ; 
One more is nearing the dark, unknown shore, 
The moments are waning so fast ! 
Far from the burden, the tumult and strife, 
While tears dimm'd each sorrowing eye ; 
Sad was the whisper, the last words of life : 
"It's no use, God bless you ! Good•bye ! " 
CHORUS. 
"Ring down the curtain ! " Oh, sweet be the sleer 
That waits the kind-hearted on high ! 
Fondly this menfry the heart now will keep ; 
" 
It's no use, God bless you, God bless you, 
good-bye !" 
"Ring down the curtain I" no more shall we see 
The sweet smile so kindly and true ; 
Dim are the eyes that once sparkled with glee, 
The hopes that were bright as the dew 
Dear is the vision that metu'ry recalls, 
To hearts that forever must sigh ; 
Sad is the echo that lingering falls :

HER mother was his early love, 
Her sire his boyhood's friend, 
And when they pass'd away, their child, 
The old man vow'd to tend. 
She was the sunshine of his home, 
A 
rose so bright and fair, 
With all her mother's loving ways, 
Her eyes and golden hair, 
Her eyes and golden hair. 
What wonder to his lonely heart 
Crept back the love of old, 
Bat autumn may not wed with spring, 
He cherished it untold ; 
But autumn may not wed with spring, 
He cherished it untold. 
One day there came a 
seemly knight 
To woo her from his side, 
The old man smiled upon him, 
For her sake, his joy and pride, 
His joy and pride. 
But fickle was the knight and false 
(A story threadbare old), 
He woo'd her for a 
little while, 
Then wed for lands and gold. 
A 
blighted flower can bloom no more, 
The old man wept one day, 
As murmuring the name she lov'd, 
His darling pass'd away, 
As murmuring the name she lov'd, 
his darling, his darling, his darling, pass d 
away. 
SERENADE. 
Written a-id composed by ED. C. Smut (of Smith & Leopold), 
the famous musical artists. 
I 
AM waiting at the gate, my darling Gertie, 
Waiting to see your sweet smile, 
For the moon is shining bright, my darling Gertie, 
And the little stars are twinkling all the while. 
Just come to the window and show your sweet face, 
For the old folks will not be home till late, 
For I 
have got a 
secret, darling Gertie, 
While I 
am waiting for you here at the gate. 
CHORUS. 
So open wide the window and look down upon me, 
For the old folks will not be home until late. 
For I 
have a 
secret, darling Gertie, 
While I'm waiting for you at the gate. 
Oh, I 
love you very clearly, darling Gertie, 
And would like to make you my little wife, 
So say you'll be my own, my darling Gertie, 
And I'll love and cherish you through life. 
We'll have a 
little cottage down by the riverside, 
So tell me quickly what will be my fate ;

I'm a

fancy brings a 
thought to me 
Of flowers sweet and rare, 
With grace and beauty there combined, 
And brightest hues so fair— 
So like a 
maiden that I 
loved— 
It was my happy lot ; 
I 
whispered when we parted last— 
" 
Oh ! you'll forget me not !" 
CHORUS. 
Graceful and as charming as a 
lily in the pond— 
Time has passed so swiftly— for, of her I 
am so fond— 
Daises and the roses, too, they grow around the spot 
When we parted, and I 
whispered, 
" 
You'll forget ma not !" (

We met—I

But still ' tis all the same— 
Por. 
love walks in the busy streets 
As well as in the lane. 
I 
gently pressed her tiny hand ; 
She glanced at me a 
shot--
She dropped a 
flower, I 
picked it up— 
A 
sweet forget-me-not ! (
chorus and dance.) 
At last there came a 
happy day, 
And something that I 
said 
Just caused her lips to murmur " yes I" 
And shortly we were wed. 
A 
little cottage by the brook, 
And a 
tiny garden spot 
Where grows a 
little flower called— 
A 
sweet forget-me-not ! (

TIIE other day, up by the square, 
I 
saw a 
pretty face, 
A 
pair of dancing sloe- black eyes, 
And actions full of grace; 
In silks and velvets by the yard, 
In the fashion of the day, 
Made up this charming little belle, 
Who stole my heart away. 
SPOKEN.— I 
was struck very bad ; I 
bowed; she bowed; We 
both bowed ; and ' twas not long before I 
found out— 
CHORUS. 
She was clerk in a 
candy store, 
She was clerk in a 
candy store, 
She was sweeter by far than the sweetest of sweets, 
Was this clerk of a 
candy store. 
And now we were the best of friends ; 
We chatted, laughed, and talked ; 
Her theme was candy, mine was love, 
As down the street we walked ; 
The best of friends must often part , 
t 
left my heart's delight, 
But promised we should meet agab 
'Neath the.duskys hade of night. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, at nine o'clock that evening, I 
was to escort 
home— 
This clerk, etc. 
The twinkling stars shining bright, 
They seemed so full of life, 
Winked and nodded as I 
asked, 
If she would be my wife; 
And as she gently murmured ' yes," 
One year from this sweet niuht, 
They danced and sparkled as if to say, 
We'll keep your pathway bright. 
She was clerk, etc.

HIT THE RIGHT NAIL.—{CoNcLuDzul 
The start in life we may compare 
To four cross roads that lead 
In different ways, but which to choose 
Is difficult indeed; 
Our judgment must be sign-post, and 
When that is wrong, we're led 
Through crooked paths, and fail to hit 
The right nail on the head.—Cuo. 
In courtship we should careful be, 
And pause upon the brink, 
For courtship is a 
ship, you know 
That easily will sink; 
Though matrimony's very nice, 
Pray, think before you wed, 
Or you may find, too late, you've hit 
The wrong nail on the head.—Cno. 
Though luck may seem against us, if 
We only play with care 
The game of life, some winning cards 
Will fall unto our share; 
Don't throw the game up in despair, 
But try again instead 
With hearty will, and you must hit 
The right nail on the head.—Cao. 
There is a 
tide in the affairs 
Of man, said Shakespeare wise, 
That taken at the ebb will lead 
To fortune's lucky prize; 
Use judgement, and remember this 
" 
That, as we make our bed, 
So we must lie," so try to hit 
The right nail on the head!—CHo.

THE HASH FIEND. 
BANJO SOLO. 
Composed by ED. C. 
SMITH, of SMITH and LEOPOLD, the Musical 
Monarchs. 
THERE'S a 
dizzy lives in this town, 
He's awfully " fond of hash 
He's called the worst beat in the West, 
And he's always on the mash. 
He has hash for breakfast, hash for dinner, 
And warmed up hash for tea ; 
Oh, says he, how I 
wish I 
had a 
house made of hash, 
How happy I 
would be. 
CHORUS. 
He's very fond of hash, and he never has any cash, 
And in a 
terrible manner could carry the banner, 
But has no desire to see Doctor Tanner; 
He never could get enough, and he thought it was 
awful tough, 
That no one in the city would on him take pity, 
And give him a 
good free lunch. 
This fellow would stand for hours and hours 
In the windows of a 
hashery ; 
He was the most dog-gon-dest crank for hash 
That ever you did see. 
His mammy said when he was young, 
He'd never eat cake or trash, 
But was sure to wake up in the middle of the night, 
Crying, " mamma, I 
want my bash." 
He's very fond of hash, etc. 
Oh ! this hash destroyer is now content ; 
He's got a 
red hot job, 
He's head hash slinger in a 
dizzy eating house, 
He is, so help me Bob, 
Where his soprano piccolo voice is heard, 
While he's raking in the cash, 
A-yelling out at the top of his voice, 
With his mouth chuck full of hash. 
He's very fond of hash, etc.

_ Music by W. If. BROCKWAY. 
LITTLE rosebud, are you lonely 
Now I 
am so far away ? 
For of you I'm thinking only, 
As I 
ever sadly stray ; 
Since from you I 
sweetly parted 
Earth has no delights for me, 
And I 
wander, heavy hearted, 
(Yer the land and o'er the sea. 
CHORUS. 
Little rosebud, are you lonely 
Now I 
am so far away 
For of you I'm thinking only 
As I 
ever sadly stray. 
Little rosebud, I 
am coming 
Home to see you once again ; 
For I'm weary now of roaming, 
Drifting o'er the stormy main ; 
Will you welcome home the ranger 
To the sunshine of your smile? 
Then shall sadness be a 
stranger, 
And life's sweetest joys beguile. 
Little rosebud, etc.

THEY bore him away when day had fled, 
And the storm was rolling high, 
And they laid him down in his lonely bed, 
By the light of an angry sky; 
The lightning flash'd and the wild sea lashed 
The shore with its foaming waves ; 
And the thunder pass'd on the rushing blast 
As it howl'd o'er the rover's grave, 
And the thunder pass'd on the rushing blast, 
As it howl'd o'er the rover's grave. 
No longer for him, like a 
fearless bird, 
You bark floats under the lee; 
No longer his voice on the gale is beard, 
When its guns peal over the sea; 
But near him the white gull builds on high 
Her nest by the gleaming wave; 
And the heaving billows groan and die 
On the sands of the rover's grave, 
4i.nd the heaving billows groan and die 
`in

WATCHING THE STARS AS THEY FALL. 
Sung with flattering success by Miss M AY V ERNON, the beautiful 
and talented S.nio-CJaiic Vonlist. 
You may meet your own darling at concert or ball, 
At home with mamma sitting by, 
That is, if papa permits him to call ; 
If not you meet him on the sly. 
Where'er you may meet your bliss is complete. 
But still I 
maintain above all, 
I've tried all the rest, I 
like spooning the best, 
While watching the stars as they fall. 
CHORUS. 
Watching the stars as they fall, 
Beautiful stars as they fall ; 
With my darling I'll walk, of love I 
will talk, 
As I 
watch the bright stars as they fall. 
The stars have a 
power I 
cannot explain, 
A power that true lovers know, 
One talks freely of love while gazing above,. 
While the stars in response brightly glow, 
And the girl who by day will turn coldly away 
From the swain who by sunlight looks small, 
Grows tender and kind, and never says nay, 
While watching the stars as they fall. 
Watching the stars, etc. 
As sung by GEO. GALES. 
W ONT you kiss me good-night, little darling, 
Now the song birds have gone to rest, - 
As you did in the days of childhood, 
When you leaned your fond head on my breast ? 
The silvery moon's shining, my darling, 
The little stars twinkle so bright, 
Just give me one kiss ere we part, love; 
Little darling, come, kiss me good- night. 
CHORUS. 
Wont you kiss me good-night, little darling, 
Now the little stars twinkle so bright ? 
Just give me one kiss ere we part, love ; 
Little darling, now kiss me good- night. 
Wont you kiss me good-night, little darling, 
And dream a 
sweet dream, love, for me ? 
For you know when we played in the wild wood, 
I 
was always so loving to thee. 
You remember I 
kissed your sweet cheek, love, 
As you placed your sweet hand, dear, in mine, 
And this to me softly did whisper— 
Forever, love, I 
will be thine. 
Wont you kiss me, etc. 
1311T OF COURSE ITS NO BUSINESS OF MINE. 
Some people say I 
am curious, 
For they know that I 
never refuse, 
No matter from whence I 
obtain it, 
In getting the latest of news. 
I 
certainly own that I 
do so, 
And no harm there is I 
opine; 
But whatever I 
hear I 
keep close, 
For of course it's no business of mine. 
Now, I 
see lots of chaps on Broadway. 
Who are dressed in very best style, 
With a 
diamond pin stuck in their bosoms, 
With kids and the shiniest tile. 
They measure out tape in some shop, 
And their salaries ain't very fine; 
Now I'd like to know how it is done, 
But of course it's no business of mine. 
Now, there's Jones, he's a 
temperance man, 
And he never will go near a 
bar, 
But his nose is as red as a 
berry, 
It shines like a 
lighthouse afar. 
Be always drinks milk on a 
Sunday, 
And he says that it's wholesome and fine ; 
He's a 
friend of the late Deacon Smythe, 
But of curse it's no business of mine. 
Now, I 
know lots of married men, too, 
That are steady and sober at home; 
When they're out of the sight of their spouses, 
From paths which are narrow they roam. 
They drive about town in their coaches, 
And von oft see them kick up a 
shine; 
To the " Personals" daily they're writing, 
But of Qour se it's no businesa of mine.

THE DARNMEST OF SCAMPS. 
AA 
mg 
is the burlesque of " Rosemi Shell," to the air of " The Scamp:* 
Copyrighted in 1876 by SYDNEY ROSENFELD. 
I FLATTER myself I'm a 
scamp, 
A double-dyed villain, egad! 
A scally-wag, rascal, and rogue, 
And everything else that is bad; 
I 
proved to my parents 
bane, 
A perfect young fiend to my nurso, 
And every year that I 
spend on this sphere, 
I 
am getting from bad to worse. 
CHORUS. 
If ever there was an old scamp, 
I 
flatter myself I 
am he; 
From William the Norman to Brigham the Mormon. 
They can't hold a 
candle to me. 
When first I 
began to cavort, 
A tiny young shaver of six, 
The first thing I 
did of a 
villainous sort 
Was to smash all our kittens with bricks; 
Just one year from then an old hen 
I 
captured—my age was but seven— 
I 
got a 
sky-rocket hitched on to her socket, 
And sent the old chicken to heaven. 
CHORUS. 
If ever there was an old scamp, 
I 
flatter myself I 
am he; 
From a 
Sunday-school teacher to Henry Ward Beechez. 
They can't, hold a 
candle to me. 
At twelve I 
was boss of the town, 
Had mashed every kid there was nigh; 
Laid every lad low with a 
fearful knock down, 
And given each one a 
black eye; 
At twenty I 
worhel in the banks, 
And was known as a 
deuce of a 
salter; 
One day, as they say, I 
broke loose from the ranks, 
And the papers all call me " defaulter." 
CHORUS. 
If ever there was an old scamp, 
I 
flatter myself I 
am he; 
From a 
tree- loving Mormon to 
ncan and Sherman, 
They can't hold a 
candle, to melPF 
I 
have sworn, I 
have burglared, and stolen, 
I 
have chiselled and blackmailed and lied ; 
In fact, I 
don't know of a 
crime every time 
That I 
couldn't commit if I 
tried ! 
I 
flatter myself I'm a 
scamp, 
A.deuced immenso one, egad! 
A double-dyed villain and rascal and rogue, 
And everything else that is bad.

HIS GIRL. 
An Epitaph sorrowfully recited by MR. HENRY LEOPOLD. 
SHE was beautiful and fair, 
All that man could have had ; 
And when I

Makes my poor heart sad, 
But now she's dead, and in 
The cold, cold ground, 
I 
think I 
hear her crying :

song to you I'll show,What I've seen while I've been dreaming. 
I 
dreamt I 
saw a 
cabman, and 
Desiring then to ride. 
I 
hail'd him from a. neighlfring stand, 
And quickly jump'd inside ; 
He drove me near two miles, not more, 
And so, when I 
got out, 
I 
tendered him a 
shilling, for 
'Twas his right .fare, no doubt.

WHEN I'VE BEEN DREAMING.—[CoscLuDED.] 
I 
saw him look the money o'er, 
His face with pleasure beaming, 
And he never ask'd for sixpence more, 
Then I 
knew that I 
was dreaming. 
I 
dreamt the papers every day 
Prais'd each fair lady's dress, 
Especially in pantomimes, 
And likewise in burlesques; 
To theatres I 
now allude 
Where morals " could" be taught, 
That, naught seen there could be call'd ruck 
But all was as it ought. 
I 
thought each lady was " well- clad," 
Her modest form thus screening, 
But, when I 
heard men cry, "too bad," 
Then I 
knew that I'd been dreaming. 
I 
dreamt that all the young men gay, 
Who try us girls to woo, 
ifeanvall the foolish things they say, 
And all their vows were true ; 
I 
thought they said naught that was rash, 
And none of them were scheming, 
But prized our hearts before our cash, 
Then I 
knew that I 
was dreaming. 
And when they for a 
kiss will press, 
And eyes with love are beaming, 
We ne'er say, "no," when we mean "yes," 
Then I 
knew that I 
was dreaming. 
I 
also dreamt that all the men 
Who took themselves a 
wife, 
And promised at the altar, then, 
To chelish her through life : 
I 
thought they always kept their word, 
With love for ever teeming; 
And " Family Jars," they ne'er occured, 
Then I 
knew that I 
was dreaming. 
I 
thought their hearts beat with delight, 
When baby loud was screaming; 
And never stayed out late at night, 
Then I 
knew that I 
was dreaming.

way, N. Y, 
A 
MAIDEN fair, with golden hair, 
Has led my heart astray ; 
Her winning grace, and pretty face, 
Haunts me by night and day. 
When by her side in happy pride 
How soon the hours depait. 
With loving bliss I 
named her this— 
The sunshine of my heart. 
CHORUS. 
0, my pet, my fairy queen, 
From her I'll never part, 
But with a 
kiss I 
tell her this— 
You're the sun'shine of ray heart. 
But with a 
kiss I 
tell her this— 
You're the sunshine of my heart. 
We meet at night, when stars shine bright, 
Down by the garden gate, 
And fond lips meet, in kisses sweet, 
Until the hours grow late. 
I 
whisper then to her again, 
0 may we never part; 
She says to me, I'll always be 
The sunshine of your heart. 
CHORUS. 
0, my pet, my fairy queen. 
From you I'll never part, 
But with a 
kiss I 
tell her this— 
You're .the sunshine of my heart. 
But with a 
kiss I 
tell her this 
You're the sunshine of my heart.

WANT a 
beau, now please don't laugh, 
I 
mean just what I 
say, 
I 
am determined I 
shall now 
No longer single stay. 
But where there are so many, 
It is difficult to choose, 
Some may have other fish to fry, 
And therefore we refuse. 
CHORUS. 
He must be neat, he must be sweet, 
His brains in his head must be ; 
He must not stare at girls whene'er 
He walks abroad with me. 
He must not drink, he must not think, 
When I 
speak, to make reply, 
Work every day, give me his pay, 
None other need apply. 
I 
fancy that with such a 
man, 
Life would a 
pleasure be ; 
But where to find just such a 
man 
Is what perplexes me. 
Perhaps he may be here to-night, 
Collected in the throng; 
If SO, I 
hope he'll step right up, 
IFIl make the rest all right.

UPON the rustic bridge we met 
One afternoon in spring; 
His loving words I 
can't forget, 
Within my ears they ring! 
The swans were sailing on the lake, 
And all the park was gay; 
My hand in his he chanced to take 
In such a 
charming way! 
The flowers were bright, but oh, his epoe 
They shone like stars of night; 
His smile was like the glowing skies, 
And filled me with delight; 
I 
seemed in love's delicious dream, 
My heart with rapture beat, 
And while his eyes did on me beau, 
I 
heard his lips repeat, 
" 
There is no harm in kissing; 
Pray tell me, is there, dear 
Those rosy lips invite me now, 
And no one lingers near 
Then loving ones are meeting 
No prying eyes to mark— 
There is no harm in kissing 
At twilight in the park." 
We strolled along where roses grew, 
And all was bright and fair; 
He promised ever to be true, 
And begged my love to share. 
The little birds were flying home; 
They heard my lips reply, 
And stars were bright in yonder dome 
Before we said good-bye.

THERE IS NO HARM IN HISSING.—Concluded. 
But oh, he seemed so sad to leave— 
My heart grew sad as well, 
For love within each heart did weave 
Its dear bewitching spell ! 
We lingered though the hour was late. 
How quick the time had sped! 
But when our lips met at the gate, 
He softly to me said, 
" 
There is no harm in kissing; 
Pray tell me, is there, dear1 
Those rosy lips invite me now, 
And no one lingers near! 
Then loving ones are meeting--
No prying eyes to mark— 
There is no harm in kissing 
At twilight in the park."

LOST ill the wide world, hopeless and weary ; 
Gone is the gladness that made life so dear I 
Dark is my pathway, lonesome and dreary; 
No smile to cheer me is lingering near! 
Once bloom'd around me life's fairest roses; 
Loved ones and fond ones now cheer inc no more; 
Lost in the wide world, while calmly reposes 
Each heart that blest me in sweet days of yore.

Lost in the wide world. while calmly reposes 
Each heart that blest me in sweet days of yore. 
Lost in the wide world, wand'ring, in sadress, 
Dreaming of dear ones who left me in tears, 
Stars of the midnight whisper with gladness, 
" 
Loved ones are waiting, then hush all tny fears !"

Sweet voices call me to you further shore!

Sung by " SHORTY'S Minstrel Troupe." 
Go to sleep, my little darling, • 
Rest on mother's loving breast, 
And the angels will protect you 
When within your cradle nest. 
Far above the starry heavens 
They are looking down on you, 
So repose, my precious darling, 
Close your tiny eyes of blue. 
CHORUS. 
Go to sleep, my little darling, 
Rest your head on mother's breast, 
And the angels will protect you 
When within your cradle nest. 
Far adown the dewy meadow 
All the daisies are asleep, 
And the birdies in the branches 
Also are in slumber deep. 
But in Eden far above us 
Angels' eyes are open wide, 
And you are as safe, my darling, 
As if they were at your side. 
Go to sleep, etc. 
In the early morning, darling, 
Little robin in the tree 
Will awake you from your slumber 
When he sings in merry glee. 
Then I'll take you to my bosmn, 
Till the glimmer on the jinn() 
Tells us that the sun is shining, 
And the day has come again. 
Go to sleep, etc.

And under its sparkling influence 
Will surely then find happiness.

APOLLO BELVIDERE. 
By 
ED. HARRIGAN. 
Sung in HinmoIN and HARTS Broadway Stquettes. 
HERE'S Roscoe Claude Montvedo, 
Fresh from Madison Square, 
Perfumed with balm of roses, 
Magnolia on my hair, 
My style infatuating, 
I 
am one of the F. F. A. 's— 
First families of the avenue, 
Par excellence au fait. 
I 
flirt, I 
kiss 
With the cherubs as they pass, 
Brunettes, sweet pets, 
And every pretty lass. 
At Long Branch in the summer, 
With every pretty dear, 
I 
play croquet to hear them say, 
He's the Apollo Belvidere. 
My gait's a 
la Parisian, 
My sister's name is Maude ; 
In a 
ladies' seminary,. 
I 
pay her monthly board. 
She is such an aggravation, 
Delicious, sly coquette, 
French poodles and canary birds 
Are sister's favorite pets. 
APOLLO BELVIDERE.—Concluded. 
011, George! oh, Maud! 
Now take your arm away! 
You're rude--so crude! 
What would my mamma say ? 
At all the bon ton socials, 
With every pretty dear, 
I 
waltz so gay to hear them say, 
He's the Apollo Belvidere. 
My pa's a 
large contractor, 
He supplies the army shoes 
To the soldiers on the prairie— 
I 
mean the boys in blue. 
His face is classic Grecian 
I'm the picture of my par— 
I'm the ladies' fascinator, 
Oh, at Sar-a-to-gn-ah ! 
Oh, dear ! oh my! 
Oh do not tease me, Will ? 
You wretch—you're fresh ! 
You really must keep still. 
I'm such a 
romantic fellow, 
Now don't you think it queer ? 
I'm so delightfully mellow, is 
The Apollo Belvidere.

On, promise to meet me when twilight is falling 
Beside the bright waters that slumber so fair ; 
Each bird in the meadow your name will be calling, 
And Wry sweet rosebud will look for you there ; 
It's morning and evening, for you I 
am sighing, 
The heart in my bosom is yours evermore; 
I'll watch for you, darling, when daylight is dying, 
Sweet rose of Killarney, Mavourneen Astore. 
My heart is a 
nest that is robbed and forsaken, 
When gone from my sight is the girl that I 
love! 
One word from your lips can my gladness awaken— 
Your smile is the smile of the angels above ! 
Then meet me at twilight beside the bright waters, 
The love that I've told you, I'd whisper once more; 
Oh, sweetest and fairest of Erin's fair daughters— 
Dear rose of Killarney, Mavourneen Astore. 
TELL ME WHERE IS FANCY BRED. 
TELL me where is fancy bred, 
Or in the heart, or in the head 7 
How begot, how nourished 7 
It is engender'd in the eyes, 
With gazing fed ; and fancy dies 
In the cradle where it lies : 
Let us all ring fancy's knell; 
I'll begin it,—Ding, dong, bell, 
Ding, dong, bell. 
IF I ONLY COULD. 
A. beautiful waltz sung by MISS MAY VERNON, the Serio-Comie 
Queen. 
'Tis my delight by day or night 
The god of fun to court, 
At parties or balls, races, or calls, 
Or other harmless sport. 
But I'm a 
wife, and such a 
life 
Don't suit my husband's ways, 
He watches me, and so you see, 
I 
have to sigh and say, 
CHORUS. 
If I 
only could, you can bet I 
would, 
But I 
really don't see how I 
can; 
If I 
only could, you can bet I 
would, 
If I 
only was single again. 
But now you know it isn't so, 
I 
can't do as I 
please, 
A 
little lark, but after dark, 
Would raise an awful breeze. 
If I 
was free I'd surely be 
The gayest of all the gay, 
But now from home no more I 
roam, 
So all I 
can do is to say, 
 If 
I 
only could, etc. 
CONUNDRUMS.

Well Bones, what is it ? 
Can you tell me who it is that has the greatest cor-

No, Bones I cannot ; who does have the greatest cor-
respondence ? 
Why, the fishes of course. 
Well, Bones, how do you make that out ? 
Because most everybody drops them a 
line. 
Why are people sleeping like music ? 
Because they require rest (

I TICKLED HER UNDER THE CHIN. 
Music published by G. 
P. 
BENJAMIN, 712 Eighth Avenue, can be 
obtained from any music dealer. (Copyright 1876, by W. It DENMOrr.) 
Written and composed by Iienur M ONTAGUE, and sung by him with 
overwhelming applause at Tony Pastor's Theatre, New York. 
I 
met a 
fair charmer a 
few weeks ago, 
In a 
Madison Avenue stage, 
Iler style and her figure it pleased me, you know, 
She was just about the right age. 
As we were alone, I 
suggested to her 
In terms quite polite and refined, 
That I'd be most happy to see her safe home, 
She said yes, if you'll be so kind. 
SPOKEN.—S0 
I 
took the young lady to her home, she invited 
me in, and I 
spent a 
very pleasant evening, and just before I 
left 
Cilonus. 
I 
tickled her under the chin, 
Repeat—I 
tickled again and again, 
She did not say no, she liked it, you know, 
When I 
tickled her under the chin. 
I 
called by appointment to see her next day, 
And asked her if she'd take a 
drive, 
She said I'm delighted, that's just what I 
want, 
And in a 
moment was close by my side. 
Now driving, you know, makes your appetite keen, 
So when we got back, to Delmouico's we went, 
And I 
ordered same oysters and wine. 
_rOKEN.—Yes, we had a 
delightful supper together, and after 
6upper, when the wine commenced to make ber cheeks rosy, I 
reached across the table, and I 
I 
tickled her under the chin, etc. 
AISNIMMIr 
57 
/ TICKLED HER UNDER THE CHIN— Continued. 
Now I 
see her quite often, and you won't be surprised 
That our friendship ripened so fast, 
For I 
found that in her, I 
really had met 
A 
dear, darling creature at last. 
And our love grows stronger, day after day, 
We're going to be married next June, 
And it all came, through that queer little way, 
That I 
tickled her under the chin. 
SPOF.:EN.—S0 
last night when she bid me good-by at the front 
door, she said Charley, you dear good fellow, I'll never forget 
the first time that you— 
Tickled me under the chin, 
That you tickled me under the chin, 
I 
didn't say no, for I 
liked it you know, 
When you tickled me under the chin, 
When I 
tickle her under the chin, 
I 
tickled again and again, 
She did not say no, for she liked it, you know, 
When I 
tickled her under the chin. 
SPOKEN.— This is the moral of the story: 
You all have a 
chance for adventtres like this, 
With the charming young ladies you meet, 
And you'll find on an average that five out of ten 
Won't object to a 
drive and a 
treat; 
But pray let me give you one piece of advice, 
When a 
girl's loving kiss you would win, 
Just do it quite gently, and don't be too rough, 
When you tickle her under the chin. 
Caortus. 
When you tickle her under the chin, 
Repeat—When you tickle her under the chin. 
Just do it quite gently, and don't be too rough, 
When you tickle her under the chin.

UNDER TH.E ARCH IN THE PARK. 
Dedicated to Miss JENNIE MORGA.N. 
Words by W. E. McNuury. 
Music by GEO. VoN 
(Copyrighted.) 
UNDER the arch in the park, 
We were delightfully dreaming, 
Sweet was the song of the lark, 
Sunbeams around us are streaming; 
He sat with his hand. clasped in mine, 
My heart how I 
longed to unmask it, 
Glad to have said " It is thine." 
Had he the courage to ask it. 
CHORUS. 
Birds of the air, joyous and fair, 
Singing from dawn until dark ; 
Were you asleep, or did you just peep 
Under the arch in the park ? 
Under the arch in the park 
Shadows around us were falling, 
Hushed was the song of the lark, 
Only the night-birds were calling ; 
He whispered in tenderest strains, 
But his love, ah I 
he dared not reveal it, 
A 
kiss would have soothed all his pains— 
Had he the courage to steal it. 
Birds of the air, etc. 
Under the arch in the park, 
Moonlight around us was shining. 
He timidly made the remark : 
"OhI for a 
heart I 
am pining. 
You might give me yours, love," he said, 
" 
I 
promise you never to break it." 
I 
blushed and I 
hung down my head— 
Then he mustered up courage to take it. 
Birds of the air, etc. 
DARKEST BEFORE DAY. 
MOTTO SONG. 
Words and Music by ED. C. 
SMITH. 
THIS world is a 
stage of excitement, 
No matter where'er you may go, 
And in this life's great drama 
Some people have hard parts, you know; 
Some people are always complaining, 
While others look cheerful and gay, 
But heed the old adage, and never forget, 
" 
It's the darkest hour just before clay." 
CHORUS. 
So do not get discouraged, 
Never mind what people say, 
Make the golden rule your motto, 
And live an honest way ; 
Be upright, brave, and true, 
Alone on life's highway, 
And remember the old adage, 
" 
It's the darkest before day." 
Now all of you sometimes have bad luck, 
And the world, it looks dark and forlorn, 
41' 
It is then that your friends will all leave you, 
That is, if your money is gone ; 
But try and bear up and be cheerful, 
Don't mind what such friends do or say, 
It will learn you a 
lesson, and never forget 
" 
It's the darkest hour just before day." 
So do not get discouraged, etc.

W E'RE back from the parade, my boys, 
With banners in our hands; 
Forninst the people we did drill, 
A 
gay and gallant band. 
'Twas Uncle Sam, our own true friend, 
Who greeted one and all, 
And blessed the gallant Irishman 
Who answered to the call. 
As we marched along the street, 
All the people us did greet, 
They called us their bold laddie bucks, 
And said we looked so neat ; 
They said we were their pets, 
And upon us they made bets, 
That we could outbate any squad 
Whoever took a 
step. 
CHORES, 
4a. 
As we marched around, around, around, 
The captain gave command, 
That all the boys who were in sound, 
Should join our gallant band. 
So we marched abreast, like all the rest, 
110iere heroes congregate. 
Sure Irishmen will ne'er forget 
The story we relate. 
with 
Now there was Mulcahey and Muldoon, 
Arrayed in grandest style, 
With bran new suits, just like a 
groom ; 
They marched along for miles. 
With eyes to the front, the music played 
Their martial airs so grand, 
Right shoulder shift arms, the order comes, 
We quickly obey the command. 
As we marched around, etc.
