Dear Mr. Lomax:
We have some very interesting leads to Minorcan songs in St. Augustine, and Negro
songs in phosphate and turpentine camps, but due to the reduction of our staff, it will take
some time for us to prepare for your visit.
I believe it would be better for you to plan to come later in the summer, and we will send
you a list of songs in advance of your visit.
Sincerely yours, Carita Doggett Corse Dr. Carita Doggett Corse State Director Federal
