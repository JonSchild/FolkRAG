MS. GERTRUDE JACKSON:  You know this  
01:00:01 
is great, greater for me.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  Well, we'll be able to 
share a little bit of this visit with 
people all over the United States of 
America and the world.  
 
MS. JACKSON:  Okay.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  We certainly need to 
get to know who you are and what 
you've done.  Please, tell us for 
starters, what is your name?  
01:00:19 
MS. JACKSON:  Gertrude Jackson.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  And so much of what we 
know about you comes from what we've 
read in the newspapers and heard on 
the radio, what you did as a wife and 
a mother and a community activist but 
tell us when you were born, where you 
were born a little bit about what it 
was like to grow up where you grew 
up.  
01:00:40 
MS. JACKSON:  Okay.  I was born in 
Madison, Illinois in 1923, and later, 
my daddy moved to Arkansas to take

over the farm that--when his daddy 
died, and he came down to Arkansas to  
01:01:00 
take over the farm for his mother and 
that's how we got to Arkansas.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  How did your family 
come to be in Madison, Wisconsin?  
Where did the family start and how 
did you get from there to Madison, 
Wisconsin?  
 
MS. JACKSON:  Illinois.  Well, I was 
there--I mean, we were in Illinois, 
you know, when I was born.  Daddy had  
01:01:25 
moved to Illinois and he was working 
and that's where we were born, and 
then he came back after his father 
died to take over this 88-acre farm 
for his mother.  That's why, that's 
what brought us back.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  So how many brothers 
and sisters did you have there?  
 
MS. JACKSON:  I had six brothers and 
I may have to count them--five  
01:01:53 
sisters, four sisters.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  Okay, can you say that 
again?  How many brothers and

MS. JACKSON:  Six brothers, I have

six brothers, and four sisters.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  So what was it like 
growing up on an 88-acre cotton farm?  
Did you actually work?  
 
MS. JACKSON:  A little because I was, 
mostly stayed in the house and kind 
of fixed them and stuff, but see, at 
7 I wasn't going to be helping, but 
it was okay.  What was it like 
growing up there?  It was good.  It  
01:02:34 
was different.  It was so different 
from Illinois, just say for instance, 
my first year in school was in 
Illinois and I see in Illinois, I was 
first grade, everybody had had their 
own room.  And they had a place where 
you--a little room where you hang 
your coats and things and that was 
when I got to Arkansas--well, first 
let me back up.  In Illinois I just  
01:03:07 
had to walk about a block to school, 
no more than that, and when I got to 
Arkansas, we had to walk four, five

miles to school, and then you get in 
the school and everybody is in the  
01:03:24 
same room from the first through the 
eighth grade.  And they had little 
nails on the wall at the back of the 
room where you hang your coats, and 
you could take your little snack.  
They would sit at the back of the 
wall and that was just so different.  
It was just hard getting used to 
that.  That's what was strange to me 
when we moved to Arkansas, and the  
01:03:51 
classroom's just one big room, and 
like, fourth through the--first 
through fourth grade would be on one 
end of the building, and fifth 
through eighth, they were on the 
other end and the big heater is 
right--you all know what a heater is?  
 
INTERVIEWER:  Definitely know what a 
heater is.  
 
MS. JACKSON:  So it was in the middle  
01:04:14 
and that's about it.  It didn't take 
me long to get used to it, walking.  
It wasn't bad but I just wasn't used

to it, but it didn't take me long to 
catch on, okay.  
01:04:29 
INTERVIEWER:  So how many children 
were in that one-room school?  
 
MS. JACKSON:  Oh, it wasn't many at 
that time.  Back in there, no more 
than about maybe 60.   
 
INTERVIEWER:  How many?  
 
MS. JACKSON:  60.

room?  
 
MS. JACKSON:  Right.  
01:04:47

fourth on back, we were one end and 
the others on the other end.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  So how much schooling 
did you eventually have?  
 
MS. JACKSON:  Eventually I got two 
years in college--no, three I was in 
college.

01:05:11 
do your high school work?

that time, Marvell only went through-

-Marvell only went to the 10th grade.  
The high school went to 10th grade  
01:05:23 
here in Marvell, and this is where I 
got my--up to 10th grade.  What you 
would do, youâ€™d have to find someone 
to live with and just daddy would pay 
them rent and see if they had a 
woodstove, too, and they would--he 
had - - shop on wood, so he would put 
that wood in the wagon and leave my 
brothers bringing - - kept us wood 
through winter, that's how we kept  
01:05:53 
warm.  And that's about... I think 
that's about it.  But--and I 
graduated--when you graduate, this 
graduation was from the 10th grade 
because this is as far as they went, 
and they had a school in Helena that 
went to the 12th grade, so that's 
where my sister went and finished.  
But at the time, I finished, my mama 
got sick and I didn't go any farther.   
01:06:33 
And then years later, at school, I 
got my GED.  They were giving people 
GEDs and then years, a few years

later, I was working with Mid-Delta 
and they said let us go to college  
01:06:51 
and so I just got thirty--I was in, 
you know, early childhood.  Okay. 
 
INTERVIEWER:  When you were growing 
up, let's talk about your earliest 
years in Illinois, and then in 
Arkansas.  When you were growing up, 
do you remember instances of outright 
flagrant discrimination?  
 
MS. JACKSON:  No, I don't.  But did 
you say in Illinois or just all over  
01:07:23 
everywhere?  
 
INTERVIEWER:  Let's just start with 
Illinois.  Do you remember?  
 
MS. JACKSON:  No, I don't remember 
any.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  Nothing in Illinois?  
 
MS. JACKSON:  No.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  And Arkansas, your 
early years in Arkansas?  
 
MS. JACKSON:  I just noticed the  
01:07:39 
schools, you know, different schools 
were... It was different.

for me the difference between the 
schools, between the schools that you  
01:07:53 
were allowed to attend and the 
schools that--what's the difference?  
 
MS. JACKSON:  Oh, okay.  Well, 
there's a lot of difference.  How can 
I explain that?  We were in this one-
room school like I say, I already 
explained that, and then they were--
the other schools, the white schools, 
just beautiful and all together, and 
the white children rode the bus to  
01:08:16 
school but we walked.  And that was 
the difference.  And one thing that 
brought to mind when you said that, 
we'd be walking to school and the 
white--the bus passed us, there's a 
boy on the other side of the metal 
and he'd be passing by and he'd say 
"nigger, nigger, nigger, nigger, 
nigger," so one day, a boy got--he 
was waiting for him and the boy  
01:08:45 
stepped on the ditch and he got him a 
stick, so the feller put his hand out 
of the window and said "nigger,

nigger," he popped him, and after 
that they never--they had the window  
01:08:56 
rolled up when they'd come through.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  So I'm quite sure there 
were many times when you and your 
pals, your childhood friends would go 
home to your parents and your uncles 
and aunts and tell stories like that.  
What did they say to you in response 
to how you were to respond to that?  
 
MS. JACKSON:  To what I just said?  
 
INTERVIEWER:  Yeah, when there were  
01:09:20 
moments when people called you nasty 
names and were mean to you and you 
would go home to adults and say--what 
kind of advice did they give you 
about responding?  
 
MS. JACKSON:  I never really 
experienced being--something happened 
at school like that, because I was 
just - - I didn't mettle.   
 
INTERVIEWER:  There was a newspaper  
01:09:50 
report not too long ago.  It talked 
about how one of your daughters has 
said that she wanted to be white so

she could have--  
 
MS. JACKSON:  So when I got upset  
01:10:02 
with her, and like the spirit say, I 
asked her why--it came to me just 
like that.  And I said, now why do 
you want to be white?  So we can have 
some swings and some seesaws and have 
a pretty school, and see, if I had 
cut her off I never would have known 
her reason.  And she said it's since 
she'd been grown, that was the pretty 
school.  Oh, yes, and we could have  
01:10:33 
some swings and seesaws and we didn't 
have any of that, just the naked 
ground, just nothing.  And of course 
we had invented our own - - games and 
like that.   
 
INTERVIEWER:  So the first time you 
heard her say that, how did you feel?  
 
MS. JACKSON:  I felt like--white?  
Why do you want to be white?  But 
then after she explained, I said...  
01:11:04 
Then I found out it wasn't white--
it's what, the things they had.

that.  Figure out a way to--  
 
MS. JACKSON:  I think that's the 
beginning.  What I just said?  
 
MALE VOICE 1:  Yeah, talk about how 
your daughter came to you so everyone 
at home will be able to hear it from 
the very beginning.  
 
MS. JACKSON:  Oh.  I was in the 
kitchen cooking and she's just  
01:11:36 
standing round, and she said "I wish 
I was white."  And I stopped, kind of 
like--didn't like it.  And I said, 
well--the spirit said ask her why.  
And that's what she told me--so I can 
have some swings, and seesaws, and go 
to the pretty school and... She said 
it was the prettiest place, and see, 
we didn't have swings and seesaws at 
our school.  But to make a long story  
01:12:15 
short, she wanted to be in that 
pretty school, and wanted to have 
some swings and seesaws.

time, I didn't dwell it.  It just 
kind of passed through, because you 
know, I knew that's the way it was.   
 
INTERVIEWER:  So you spent so much of 
your life in the area of community 
organizing.  What motivated you?  How 
did you get started doing that?  
 
MS. JACKSON:  I think the first thing  
01:12:52 
that motivated me, if I can kind of 
tell, explain the Marvell school 
district, okay, the Marvell school 
district covers like, oh... 20 miles 
around.  And there were a school--
okay, we had so many schools out in 
the--see, I grew up in Gum Bottom.  
Somebody grew up in Coffers Creek 
[phonetic]--there was a school 
everywhere, where there was a church  
01:13:25 
there was a school.  And then the 
Marvell school district years later 
decided to build a school down there

for--and about six of the communities 
came together, went to this one  
01:13:41 
school.  It was a beautiful school, 
but what happened after three or four 
years, the sewage start messing up, 
and the sewage would back up in the 
school so at first it was just water 
and they would come on and say "Oh, 
the bathroom flooded today," and see, 
I wasn't paying it much attention.  
The bathroom flooded, and it would 
come on--it got where it got so bad,  
01:14:12 
everything was flooding out and the 
boys had to clean it up.  They'd get 
them - - from the store, the boys had 
to get the boxes and things and clean 
it up, so we decided to go to the 
school board.  That's where I got 
started, went to the school board to 
tell them about it, and they would 
say, "Oh, they just don't know how to 
use the bathroom."  And so it went on  
01:14:42 
so long, they'd come home from 
playing so long, so regular, my 
husband said "I'm going to go out

there and see this thing."  And so we 
had gone to the school board for  
01:14:54 
several times and they just wouldn't 
do anything, just felt like we didn't 
know how to use the bathroom at all.  
And the last time we went to the 
school board and my husband asked 
them about fixing it again, - - just 
my husband and another lady, she's 
passed away, but coming from the 
school board that night, my husband 
said, "If I could get these people to  
01:15:27 
take the children out of school, 
they'd fix it."  That man got up the 
next morning and went all through the 
community and was telling them about 
it, and everybody agreed to take 
their children out, and so that's the 
first boycott, turn at boycott, and 
when we did, so they went down the 
next day.  This was on a Friday--we'd 
come that Monday, my husband went  
01:15:56 
down to the school to see what was 
going on.  He said well, I forget how 
many children they had, but eight or

ten children showed up at school, and 
so after that--and it just stayed  
01:16:08 
vacant until they didn't get to 
school at all that year.   
 
INTERVIEWER:  Let me get the 
timeframe for this.  What year was 
the first year that you went to the 
school board to complain?  
 
MS. JACKSON:  You know, I... I really 
can't remember.  I know my... You 
know, I just don't remember because 
let me see - - went to that school  
01:16:45 
when he was 5.  Now, if we could do 
some math...  
 
INTERVIEWER:  We'll figure that out 
later.  
 
MS. JACKSON:  You're right--figure 
that out later, okay.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  Now, your husband went 
through the community basically 
knocking on doors and asking parents 
to keep their children at home.  
01:17:02 
MS. JACKSON:  Right.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  Everyone unanimously 
said "Yes, we will keep the

children"--  
 
MS. JACKSON:  Right, and what he did- 
01:17:09 
-now, we had this country store.  
There would be a lot of men at the 
store.  That's how he reached a lot 
of them, and then they--he took them 
down there and let them see for 
themselves and everybody went down 
and looked and that Monday morning, 
they kept the children at home.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  And how did the school 
board officials respond?  
01:17:32 
MS. JACKSON:  Some of them said--some 
of the people said, "Somebody needs 
to go there and whoop that Hog 
Jackson."  They called my husband 
Hog--that somebody needs to go there 
and whoop him, but they didn't bother 
us.  It was fine.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  So did they call you--
what happened after that?  How did it 
get to be fine?  Did they call you in  
01:17:54 
for meetings?  
 
MS. JACKSON:  Oh, no, they just... I 
don't know what--when we went to

court.  We didn't go to court for 
that, but after we walked out of  
01:18:08 
school and they send people down--
well, what happened, they were going 
to send somebody down to see about 
the plumbing.  And so come to see the 
president of the school, his brother 
was--what do you call it, sanitation 
thing in Helena, so they send someone 
down to see how it was when we took 
the children out of school.  And so 
the superintendent said there wasn't  
01:18:46 
nothing wrong with it and so we 
wanted to have it checked, so they 
called a feller, whoever you call 
that came out and checked it, and he 
said, "Oh, it's fine.  Nothing wrong 
with the bathroom.  It's fine."  But 
see, that was his brother that 
checked it, and see, Howard was here 
at that time, and Howard called the 
sanitation place from Little Rock,  
01:19:11 
and they came down and checked it 
out, and they made them dig it up, 
and do it over because it was put up-

that's why the bathroom was messing

up.  And they fixed it and we got 
back in school.  I guess it lasted...  
 
INTERVIEWER:  How long were the

like--I remember, I forget what month 
it was but they were out, like, near 
the whole term.

about the work that they actually had 
to do to clean up after the bathroom  
01:21:07 
flooded.  
 
MS. JACKSON:  Mine was too little at 
that time to do it, but the bigger 
boys did--you know, the big children, 
they had to do it.  And they'd talk 
about it at first it's just water.  I 
wished--I was trying to get ahold of 
these couple old boys still living, I 
wish I could have got them to tell 
the story about how they used to have  
01:21:32 
to clean up the bathroom, mop up 
water and all that, and get - - old 
boxes from the store to, you know, 
put stuff in.  I wished I had one of 
them here because they'd tell that 
story.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  We'll probably find 
one.  Let's move a little bit forward 
and talk about your work in the 
freedom movement.  When you first  
01:21:58 
heard that there were people who were 
doing work in the civil rights arena, 
what did you think?

the workers came in.  They came into  
01:22:12 
the family, stayed, had a meeting 
with the family here in town, so see, 
I lived 12 miles out and they came 
and they said some--we're civil 
rights workers.  It's down in Mr. 
Adam's house, and Mr. Adam wanted him 
to bring some people in that may be 
interested and four or five of us 
went to this meeting and listened to 
what they had to say.  And to make a  
01:22:46 
long story short, we got some work on 
- - the first--back up.   
 
INTERVIEWER:  First of all--  
 
MS. JACKSON:  That's how we went 
there to talk with them and then they 
asked us to go back and get a group 
together and some interested people 
and we came back and checked with 
some people in our community, which 
was called Jones Ridge and  
01:23:10 
we had six or seven people to meet 
and they'd come down to tell us what 
they were all about.

01:23:24 
Adams is.  
 
MS. JACKSON:  He's just a neighbor.  
He's a farmer.  He ran the store, and 
he was one of the people that kind of 
would be--I'd call a civil rights 
worker.  I don't know.  We hadn't 
heard talk of anything but they said 
come here, it's a man, it's somebody 
here from the civil rights and he 
wants to talk to us.  
01:23:57 
INTERVIEWER:  And what's Mr. Adams'--
what's his whole name?  
 
MS. JACKSON:  Overtis [phonetic].  
Overtis Adams.   
 
INTERVIEWER:  And do you remember the 
names of any of the people who came 
from other parts of the country to--? 
 
MS. JACKSON:  - - You know, it's 
about two of them still living--Eva 
May Williams and a brother, I forget  
01:24:27 
his name but he's a Williams, might 
think of it before we leave.

school district, but she's the one 
that, you know, when we come together 
to do something about the school 
situation, because she was the 
secretary.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  Now... I'm sorry, I 
thought I stepped on one of your 
sentences.  I'm sorry.  Now, there 
were SNCC workers who were working in 
the area.

MS. JACKSON:  Right.  Mm-hmm.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  What do you remember 
about the SNCC workers?  Do you 
remember their names, where they came 
from?  
 
MS. JACKSON:  Myrtle Glascoe and 
Howard Himmelbaum.  And so once we 
got visited, you know, they were here 
a while before anything, we started 
to do anything, but just kind

of got to feel and we would meet and 
they'd always have a building full, a

you all do it yourself now, but they 
would just be there.  He didn't want 
to be the leader all the time, and 
that's about that.

other names of SNCC workers?

Lane [phonetic]... So many of them 
are gone, because not many of them 
are left so it's hard to think.

atmosphere like?  What was the mood 
like when those SNCC meetings were 
going on here in the area?  
 
MS. JACKSON:  You know, it was just 
kind of nice.  We'd have a packed

church every Thursday night.  And so 
we just made it--come on, ask me.

MS. JACKSON:  Some of them, the first 
place they lived was my uncle, Howard 
Himmelbaum, he lived with my uncle 
and they had a place in Helena that 
they stayed but my uncle kept them 
for a while until he got nervous 
because he had a store and his house 
was right by the store and they 
didn't want white folks to see him 
coming out of his house so then he  
01:27:33 
moved, he moved way back and lived 
with my cousin Carrie--Carrie Davis 
[phonetic] at that time.  But he had 
to walk a couple miles back to the 
mud and stuff to get over there, and 
so we said, well, won't nobody find 
him back there because if he just 
comes out on the porch and opened the 
door, the store was right there, even 
with the house and stuff.  We didn't  
01:27:58 
want him.  Then my uncle got real 
nervous about having this white man 
living with him.  He didn't stay with

together and it was just like, we 
just got very comfortable with it and  
01:29:20 
so--and we were blessed that didn't 
anything happen to us.  And I 
remember one day, when they built the 
Zachariah [phonetic] housing project 
and the president--I mean, what do 
you call it?  Who's of the state?   
 
INTERVIEWER:  Governor.  
 
MS. JACKSON:  Governor--governor, 
right.  The governor came down that 
day and a lot of people to show off,  
01:29:49 
you know, they were opening up the 
housing project and so Howard was 
there, so the superintendent of the 
school, he stepped to me.  "Gertrude, 
who is he?  Who is that?"  I make 
like I couldn't find--"no, that right 
there, right there."  I said "Oh, 
that's Howard Himmelbaum."  
 
INTERVIEWER:  Do you remember anyone 
else in addition to Handelbaum?  
01:30:18 
MS. JACKSON:  Myrtle Glascoe.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  Okay, talk about--

Myrtle?  Well, she'd come to the 
house and they'd just say things, 
they'd just--just like another one of 
my 11 children.  And just remember 
her, just point something, up and 
come into the house and sit right at 
the table with all my 10 children and 
like I say, just like another  
01:30:56 
daughter, she would go to the 
meetings with us and you know, they 
would explain different things about 
civil rights and things like that.   
 
INTERVIEWER:  So what did they 
encourage the people attending the 
meetings to do?  
 
MS. JACKSON:  You know, just stand up 
and be bold and let's get something 
done.   
01:31:20

the names of the people living in the 
community who stood up and said yes,

we're going to be bold?  Do you 
remember people who actually joined  
01:31:31 
the movement and worked very hard?  
 
MS. JACKSON:  Let me... It wasn't 
very many that worked very hard, but 
most of them saw what we were doing, 
and then see, some of them were too 
afraid and they just stayed back but 
they would come to the meetings and 
listen, and I can't think of the  
names of the people--about six of 
them were, you know, standing back,  
01:32:01 
giving us, you know, spinning their 
ideas and things.  And so--but like I 
say, most of them were afraid and we 
knew the teachers were afraid, and we 
didn't want them to be in the 
meetings because we didn't want them 
to lose their jobs.

were afraid?  How did they explain 
their fear?

join.  He said Jack, I'm just scared.  
I'm just scared.  I won't go with you  
01:32:42 
but I'm for what you're doing.  And 
other than that, that's about it.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  And do you remember 
what people said to people who were 
afraid to get them to step out of 
their fear and be bold?  
 
MS. JACKSON:  No, I don't remember 
anybody bothering them.  It was just 
a few little - - come to those 
meetings.  Now, one thing that  
01:33:11 
happened down in my country, Maxine 
Hathaway was one of the 
schoolteachers here in Marvell, and 
you know, on Sundays if we were in 
church, after Sunday school we're 
going to say something about the 
situation.  And so different people 
told her, "Girl, you better stop 
going to the church.  Tell me they 
have civil rights meetings down at  
01:33:37 
that church."  And so she left our 
church and went to the church where 
they didn't meet, came here to

Marvell and went to church.   
 
INTERVIEWER:  So once you became  
01:33:53 
involved, there were moments of... 
There were repercussions.  White 
people did not like what you were 
doing.  How did they respond to you?  
 
MS. JACKSON:  Well, not really, but 
I'll tell you one day I was in the 
drugstore, and the lady that worked 
at the drugstore--by the way, she's 
in a nursing home now.  But anyway, 
this white man was in there, and I  
01:34:25 
was getting my medicine and she said 
to me, she said, "There she is, there 
she is, there she is," like they were 
trying to find out who was that that 
was doing the civil rights work and 
so that's the only thing that I saw.   
 
INTERVIEWER:  And did anyone say 
anything to you once you were pointed 
out?  
 
MS. JACKSON:  No, they just--I guess  
01:34:48 
the feller just wanted to see what I 
looked like, just wanted to see that 
lady that's heading civil rights.

INTERVIEWER:  So do you remember 
instances of other people having  
01:34:59 
crosses burned in their yards or 
gunshots fired?  
 
MS. JACKSON:  Overtis Adams had a 
cross--not Overtis.  This is way out 
in the country.  I can't think of his 
name right now, but they burned a 
cross in his yard and then John 
Hamilton, he's one of the leaders.  
He's one of the big leaders that was 
with us--John Hamilton and his wife.  
01:35:28 
INTERVIEWER:  What do you remember 
about the time that the cross was 
burned?  
 
MS. JACKSON:  I just remember that 
the children--we were just excited, 
didn't know--we didn't know what it 
meant, but my daughter was talking.  
They were talking some time ago--all 
we know, that when somebody burns a 
cross in the yard the white folks  
01:35:49 
didn't like you, so she said that's 
all she can get out of it.  Then she 
noticed some reason the white folks

INTERVIEWER:  Were there black folks  
01:35:59 
who tried to respond to that in a 
retaliatory way?  
 
MS. JACKSON:  No, no we didn't do 
anything, just kept going on like it 
didn't happen.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  And how many cases of 
cross burnings do you know of?  
 
MS. JACKSON:  Just two.  One in Masco 
Anderson [phonetic].  Now, John 
Hamilton, it got in the air because  
01:36:32 
he was the main person along with my 
husband, John Hamilton--it got in the 
air that--and he lived way back off 
the road--that a gang had planned to 
come and you know, attack them that 
night.  And so what the men did was 
about 10 or 12 men, they met down 
there with their guns, because this 
man is way back, had to go down the 
field to get to his house and they  
01:36:59 
went there and stayed all night to 
see if anybody was coming in, because 
one of the boys said now if they come

driving out through here I'm going to

01:37:11 
incident there.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  Let's talk about 
newspapers for a little bit.  Did the 
newspapers cover--did they write 
stories about the civil rights 
activity going on down here?  
 
MS. JACKSON:  No.  No, we didn't--no, 
it was never in the news.  Now... 
What was in the news--well, it wasn't 
here, but Beatrice, our executive  
01:37:50 
director, she was going to school in 
Little Rock, and she would read it 
there and then just talk about 
Jackson and she heard some things.  
She was here, but she was sitting 
around talking about it at school in 
Little Rock, and...  
 
INTERVIEWER:  How much conversation 
was there about the activity 
happening just a stone's throw away  
01:38:19 
in Little Rock?  There was a 
difference--  
 
MS. JACKSON:  Say that again.

did they play close attention to what 
was--  
 
MS. JACKSON:  Yes, they did.  Uh-huh.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  What kind of 
conversations did they have about 
Little Rock activity?  
 
MS. JACKSON:  Well, just discuss the 
situation and--it wasn't very much 
because... And oh, like my children 
were so little because I remember  
01:38:53 
they were so little because okay, 
every time the news came on they had 
to be quiet, so this news came on 
they were showing in Little Rock, you 
know, going in the school and the 
club and things.  My little girl 
said, "Oh, the news is good tonight," 
because she was excited--she just 
didn't know what it was all about.  
But that's all we saw the few times,  
01:39:18 
you know, when it would come on the 
TV about what was going on.  My 
husband didn't have to say "You all

husband spend any time telling your 
children exactly what was going on?  
 
MS. JACKSON:  Exactly what was going 
on, yes.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  How did you explain to 
your children what was going on in 
Little Rock?  
 
MS. JACKSON:  I just told them it's 
just like it is here in Marvellâ€” 
01:39:52 
whites go to one school and so now 
they're trying to integrate them and 
let blacks go to the school, and the 
fight was about because they didn't 
want them in their school and that's 
why they had to bring down the troops 
and all these things.   
 
INTERVIEWER:  And how did your 
children respond to that story?

01:40:22 
already knew because it's just like, 
it was here, you know?  You see what

whites were going to the big school

little chicken coops.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  Tell us about the 
moment when there's an issue about 
the county fair.  
 
[laughter]  
 
MS. JACKSON:  It wasn't really an 
issue about the county fair, but this 
is the way it happened: We decided to 
boycott the school and so Reverend 
Anderson, the man with the burned  
01:41:01 
cross in the yard, he's at the 
meeting.  He said I'll tell you all 
what, since we're boycotting school, 
let's boycott that fair, and they 
said yeah, and that's how we come to 
boycott the fair.  And another thing 
about the fair, the superintendent, 
you know, - - in college in Pine 
Bluff, that's a black college at that 
time.  The superintendent, the choir  
01:41:34 
from - - College was coming down to 
sing at the choir, and we heard that-
-we were in Little Rock at this trial

about this boy.  You know, we had to 
go to trial, we had to go to court,  
01:41:51 
so we were in Little Rock, so Mrs. 
Hamilton on our way back home, she 
said let's go by the college and tell 
them don't come down to sing because 
we're boycotting everything.  So we 
went back and talked with them, and 
the superintendent was out of town.  
They said he would have to change it; 
we can't change it.  But anyway, they 
came on down to sing and then I got  
01:42:21 
another lady that we just, we said 
let's go to the fair and see how it's 
going to come out so we went to the 
fair and just parked out from--in the 
ditch about the fair, and it worked.  
People didn't come.  I saw some 
little children come, saw some little 
white boys--they'd come around.  They 
had heard something.  They didn't 
know what--some little black boys,  
01:42:44 
too.  Oh, they say you ainâ€™t supposed 
to go to fair today, they'd be--and 
they'd just run, just running, and it

college choir came down, this big bus 
came down and children got off and 
they washed up the bleachers, they 
sing like they had a crowd but it 
wasn't sold there.  And see, the fair

that's what happened with that.  And

they did, they burned the shape of a 
cross in the grass and we all just 
went out and looked at it, and the 
grown people knew what it was like, 
what it was about, but my daughter 
was telling me lately, she said see, 
out here you all are whispering, you  
01:45:15 
all--you know, we didn't sit down and 
really explain to them.  We hear you 
all talking but all I know, they said 
when they burn a cross in your yard, 
it was because white folks--something 
about white folks didn't like you if 
you got a cross burned in your yard 
so that's what she was telling me.

you?

fine with it, because--just had a  
01:45:54 
little fight in me and just ready to 
go on.  But it didn't stop us.  And 
then before that then, I don't know 
which comes first--it doesn't matter.  
When they set the shop on fire where 
we keep the tractors and trucks and 
things, my daughter went out on the 
porch one night to do something, and 
she looked up and she said, "The 
shop's on fire" and boy, everybody  
01:46:26 
jumped to attention then.  My husband 
had gone to bed.  I said, the man 
must have been expecting somebody to 
attack him.  He jumped out of the bed 
so quick that he didnâ€™t even put on 
his shoes.  So he went out there and 
the truck--the tractor was out there, 
so what he did, he found the log 
chain, what old chain he had, hooked 
to a tractor, then hooked it to the  
01:46:54 
truck, pulled the truck out across 
the field, and that's where the truck 
burned up, and what had happened,

somebody had stuck a rag or something 
down in the gas tank and set it, set  
01:47:08 
the rag on fire, and that's what was 
burning, so--but anyway, it caught 
the truck.  Now, if we hadn't seen 
it, it probably would have got the 
tractors and everything else.  Pulled 
it out across the field and that's 
where it burned up.  And like, we 
didn't put no papers in there, so we 
weren't doing stuff like that.

01:47:32 
wasn't there also an incidence where 
they put sugar in the--

picker.  They didn't lock up--he was 
working some land way away from home 
and when they get through, they just 
leave it in the field until they get 
back, so his brother went to the 
field that morning to, you know, pick 
cotton.  He said before I got there I  
01:47:58 
could see some tracks, looked like 
four tractor tracks, so he said,

01:48:11 
there and got on the cotton picker, 
he says I got halfway down, piece 
down through the field, it stopped.  
And they said you can put sugar in 
the tank and that will lock up 
everything but they don't know what 
made it happen, but it locked up and 
they didn't have no cotton picker.

of flash went over me, that's the 
first time something--I felt  
01:49:15 
uncomfortable.  They followed me just 
a little while and after a while, the 
driver must have changed his mind--
the driver pulled off and sped by me 
but when he sped by, the man on the 
passenger side had his little pistol.  
He shot right across in front of the 
hood of my car.  And I wouldn't tell 
my husband because I knew he was 
going to get out and try to find who  
01:49:38 
did it and I didn't want him putting 
himself in danger like that.  It was 
a long time before I told him; didn't 
tell any of them, because I go to 
work every day.  He would have been 
thinking about me going to work every 
day.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  What year was that?  
 
MS. JACKSON:  I'm just so sorry.  I 
don't know.  
01:50:03 
INTERVIEWER:  Did you tell anybody?  
 
MS. JACKSON:  Later on, about maybe a 
month or so later.  I told him about

INTERVIEWER:  Had you heard of things  
01:50:17 
like that happening to other people?  
Did other people tell you about 
things like that happening to them?  
 
MS. JACKSON:  I heard about the 
things in Mississippi, you know, the 
little boy that got killed and stuff 
like that, and then, well, after 
that, the civil rights workers in 
Mississippi got killed.  I think 
Myrtle told you about that, or did  
01:50:40 
she?  
 
INTERVIEWER:  How did you respond to 
that?  
 
MS. JACKSON:  I knew they were 
letting me know they didn't like what 
I was doing, and then I knew I wasn't 
going to stop doing what I was doing, 
and that's about it.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  Wow.  Was there any 
time when your husband came to you  
01:51:17 
with any kind of thoughts that he was 
having reservations about doing what 
he was doing?

- -.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  Not a moment of fear?  
 
MS. JACKSON:  I don't remember him 
talking about being afraid or 
nothing.  But I know one--I can say 
this: To get to one of our farms we 
had to drive through the white man's 
property, and so the man told him, 
three of them told him don't come  
01:52:10 
back through there and for a long 
time they went like, six or seven 
miles out of the way to get to the 
field when they could get to it like, 
30 minutes directly.  And so one day 
he came in, he had done that for a 
long time, I guess maybe a couple 
years before.  But anyway, when he 
left one day he said, well, I'm gone.  
And he had his pistol--the first time  
01:52:39 
I ever saw him get his pistol.  He 
said they might get me today, but I 
think I can get some of them.  At

least I think I can get some of them, 
and I think that's when he broke the  
01:52:50 
thing about going through this man's 
field, didn't nobody ever bother him, 
though.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  How did you feel when 
he said that to you, they might get 
me?  
 
MS. JACKSON:  Well, I can't explain 
it but you know... In my heart it 
felt like they ain't going to get 
him, but he walked out with his  
01:53:13 
little--his called it his little 
piece.  And that's the first time he 
ever met--they might get me today, 
but I think I can get some of before 
they--because you know, they're not 
going to come at you one-on-one.  
There's always going to be a crowd

MS. JACKSON:  Well, like I say, I 
wasn't thinking about it.  I was 
sitting at my desk, see, Mid-Delta 
was - - and I was sitting at my desk 
and it just dropped in by spirit and 
all it said was something for  
01:54:32 
children and it stayed there like, 
like a couple months, just something 
for children, just something within, 
until one morning Mr. Gale Thrower, 
the Ag teacher, came to my office and 
he says, Miss Jackson, I see you all 
have a room back there that you're 
not using.  And he said you know how 
the children haven't got anywhere to 
go, and I would like to fix it up,  
01:55:04 
you know, where the children have 
something to--and I said, boy, God 
must have sent you here and we got

started from there.  His thing was - 
- my thing was education, because I  
01:55:21 
wanted more head starts--I wanted 
every child in the district to have 
seen a book before they go to school.  
And what I did that year, retired 
teachers, I had about two--Maxine 
Hathaway, Anna May Smith, and by me--
I used to haul, pick up children, 
take them to head start.  Then I knew 
where everybody was, and I went to 
different houses like Mrs. Hathaway,  
01:55:54 
took about three houses to just go 
and read a book.  I said you all are 
all I want, I want to let every child 
see a book before you go to school 
you see.  You know, we just did--that 
wasn't our culture, so when I found 
the families for, and they went to 
these families that read stories--did 
the same thing we do at head start.  
And Maxine Hathaway and Anna May  
01:56:22 
Smith and Beatrice, I think Beatrice, 
the executive director did one.  But 
anyway, that's what I wanted--I said

you all are going to see every child 
that's going to school to have seen a  
01:56:37 
book before they go, and that's what 
we did.  They would take the little 
their little paint and everything 
just like we did at head start, put 
the easel, the tree where it would be 
an easel and they would do their 
little painting and stuff and just 
read little stories to them because 
you would be surprised that the 
people never saw a book when they go  
01:56:55 
to school.  So that's what I wanted, 
and I wanted them to have these shots 
because there were so many children 
that didn't go to school because you 
don't have those shots, you can't go 
to school.  And it's so hard for them 
to get, like, 30 miles, you know, out 
there all the time and so what we 
did, I got--after these teachers, 
these ladies did the home start and  
01:57:27 
of course I was doing one too.  And 
what we did about the shots, just 
come down, the nurses from Helena

would come down to this big raggedy 
center where it was - - and they gave  
01:57:44 
shots.  They would come down and give 
them shots, and then after we got, 
after we founded BGACDC, then they 
got a grant and they built a building 
onto it, and the staff would come 
from Helena, and that's how they got 
everything.  They did everything 
there.  They do everything there that 
they did in Helena.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  So describe the  
01:58:10 
building before you tweaked in 
massaged it and polished it to turn 
it into the community center.  What 
did it look like?  
 
MS. JACKSON:  It looked pretty good 
except there wasn't no roof, there 
wasn't no...  
 
And of course, there wasn't any 
ceiling.  That's most of what this--
Channel 2 came down and took pictures  
01:58:34 
of that and what we were doing.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  There was no roof?

Service.  What did you do there?  
 
MS. JACKSON:  The first job I had  
01:00:54 
with Mid-Delta was transporting 
children to head start, go all--I 
guess I would do like, maybe 40 miles 
in the morning, 40 in the evening, 
going picking up children, going 
across the fields in different 
communities, just knocking on the 
doors and see who was there for head 
start.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  So how many children  
01:01:22 
did you transport?  
 
MS. JACKSON:  15--20, 15 in one room, 
15 in another so that's 30 children.  
And we always had to make a couple of 
trips.  And that was--it was kind of 
not so nice, but I had the station.  
The gentleman had been out to my 
house to ask me if I'd do it.  They 
thought I was the only person that 
they could find in the district that  
01:01:53 
had a station wagon, and they came 
down and asked me would I pick up the 
children for head start.  My husband

Mid-Delta was transporting children.  
And from there, teaching head start.

little bit about some of the children 
who were standouts for you, the 
children that you will remember for 
the rest of your life there at that 
community center.

stood out.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  Nobody that touched 
your heart in a special way because 
they...?

just thought about this little boy.  
He's a twin and in head start he was 
so disrupted.  You know when you get  
01:03:34 
upset, he would get up and go around 
and seat--we sit in a circle, like 
semicircle.  He'd get up and go 
around and tap everybody on the head, 
hit them and what I want to get to--
he'd get upset and he'd go around and 
knock the work off the wall.  But it 
came to, we found out that he wasn't 
coming from a comfortable home.  We 
think that was part of it and so,  
01:03:58 
like when I would take him for field 
trips, take him for a walk and stuff 
like that to cool him off, and so

someone that really stood out, and we  
01:04:14 
had to visit, do home visits and we

a little road to get to it, a little 
turn road, and I'd go there and pick 
up, so one day I went to pick her up 
and she'd have met me out on the

what are you doing out here?  Our

place that has something to do with 
that Martin Luther King.  And so she 
said but don't worry, we're going to 
get off his place, and what impressed 
me was maybe in a little better than 
a year, it was better than a year, 
they had bought up and built their 
own house and it's good they got me 
off of that because after that, I 
was--moved to head start teacher,  
01:06:00 
home start.  That's where you go into 
the home and teach them.  You do the 
same thing in the home that you did 
in school, and so I said now it's 
good they got off his place because 
when I got to be home start teacher, 
I had to take all my stuff with me 
and then once a month we'd have a 
parent meeting and all the houses 
would meet together in one house.  I

said it would have been some black

they moved off just in time, so it 
was just great.  Now, that's all I  
01:06:36 
had--I really had forgotten about 
that one.  And the other words, you 
know--  
 
MALE VOICE 1:  - -  
 
FEMALE VOICE 1:  But finish your 
thought.   
 
MS. JACKSON:  Now, where was I?  Now, 
I say it was good I moved off the 
place because from head start, 
picking up the children I had to do  
01:07:11 
home start and that's where you go 
into the home and carry all your 
materials and do all the same things 
you do at school.  I said now, if he 
hadn't put me off this place because 
like I think I had ten houses that 
I'd go to but once a month I was 
required to bring them all together 
and have a parent meeting, somebody 
from the main office would come down  
01:07:37 
and do things and I said now, that 
would have been awful, had they still 
been on his place because he sure

wouldn't want all of us coming back 
there to a meeting.  Even sometimes  
01:07:51 
like at 12 o'clock, the men would 
come out to feed them.  They'd just 
enjoy, to come out the field and 
where the head start was and see what 
we were doing, so we enjoyed--so TJ, 
Iâ€™m glad you made me think of it.

you have another one?

INTERVIEWER:  Why did he leave 
Arkansas?  
 
MS. JACKSON:  Heard that the grass is 
greener on the other side of the 
fence, you know, for a job went there 
and he worked at the commonwealthâ€” 
01:08:45 
what do you call it?  Commonwealth... 
It was a factory that he worked at.  
They called it Commonwealth.

the people started going south and 
they told him about, you know, and he 
liked what they said, and he went up 
there to try it.   
 
INTERVIEWER:  Okay.  Your children 
and your children's children and 
everyone who knows them will know a  
01:09:28 
little bit about the work that you 
and your husband did in the movement.  
 
MS. JACKSON:  Right.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  They'll know a little 
bit.  They'll never know all of it, 
but what would you say would be the 
most important thing they need to 
know about the work you did in the 
movement?  
 
MS. JACKSON:  Things that they would  
01:09:48 
need to know?  Except stand up for 
yourself, and you know... Get 
involved.  If the need ever comes,

start, they were children, some had  
01:12:27 
already gone off to school, like, 
well, like the four older ones had 
gone when the civil rights movement, 
and I just would like want to be 
involved, which most of them are 
doing, being involved with the 
schools and whatever.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  All right, wonderful.  
Thank you so much.  We are going to 
go over to your community center.

MS. JACKSON:  Okay,  because I didn't 
know what to expect, because like 
I've been to places and I had to just 
talk, just tell them what I'd done 
and so when I had put together the 
different... Let me see if I missed 
anything that I had planned, but you

01:13:37 
MS. JACKSON:  School integration, 
when they wouldn't--when the school 
system was ordered to integrate and 
the integration was to be done, like, 
three years, the first year they were 
going to do it through the third 
grade.  Then the next year they were 
going to take the grades four through 
eight.  Now, they went on and obeyed 
the first year, the children, and I  
01:14:12 
guess no more than ten or twelve 
children, black people--that was such 
an awful way to integrate, send you 
choose whether you want to go back to 
your school or go to the white 
school, that's what we had to choose.  
And so the next year it was going to 
be the fourth through the eighth, and 
that's when they--my husband called.  
That's when they balked, they  
01:14:35 
decided, uh-uh, no way, we just can't 
go no further.  And so the choice for 
them--if you don't get a choice for

because first we had planned to

march, take the children over there 
and okay, can I start over?   
 
INTERVIEWER:  Sure.  
 
MS. JACKSON:  Okay.  Now, at a 
meeting one night, Myrtle decided 
that if we could just take our 
children over there, since they 
wouldn't send us the choice form.  
We'd just go anyway, and they had 
heard that we were coming, somebody  
01:15:17 
leaked out of the meeting somehow, 
and got to the other folk and they 
were prepared for us.  They covered 
their school, the whole block around 
the school with--it was cars, trucks 
were bumper to bumper, two, three men 
on each truck.  You know these trucks 
have rifle racks on them, and so the 
lady said, they heard that you all 
are going to walk--you know, walk to  
01:15:48 
school, going to come onto school 
this morning, and they were all 
prepared for you this morning,

prepared.  And so my cousin, she was 
braver than I, crazier than I was,  
01:16:02 
however you want to call it.  But we 
said let's go and we drove around 
there and it was just like she said--
from Irving garage [phonetic] all the 
way around to the bus shop, trucks 
were bumper to bumper with two, three 
men on each one of them, waiting for 
us when we come through the mud, and 
I don't know what they plan to do, 
but that's the way it was.  And I  
01:16:32 
would like say, when we were 
boycotting, we had the church--we met 
at my church.  They set up a little 
library and bought books and things 
so we could do something while they 
were out of the school--the children 
would go down to the church and read 
books and things like that.  Thatâ€™s 
all.  Like Myrtle said now, the 
children got to have something while  
01:16:56 
they're out of school, so we were out 
of school quite a few months there, 
so at least we can meet and read

happened next took us to the court 
action.

MS. JACKSON:  Right, okay.  I guess I 
have to get... Okay, then Mr. 
Handelbaum said now, we agreed that 
we wanted to go to court.  He said 
now, but we've got to have somebody 
that you know, canâ€™t send them all to 
school.  We've got to have somebody.  
So my husband said, well, I'll do it, 
and that's how it got started with 
him, because you know, there wasn't  
01:18:03 
anybody else that wanted to, was 
willing to go to court for the 
school, so he said he would do it.

INTERVIEWER:  So describe some of the 
activity of the court.  You went to  
01:18:21 
the courtroom?  
 
MS. JACKSON:  Mm-hmm, we had to be 
there.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  Yeah.  What was that 
like?  
 
MS. JACKSON:  It was interesting.  It 
was neat.  I could say this, we had a 
good judge that after a couple of 
days he ordered them to integrate.   
 
INTERVIEWER:  And who was the judge?  
01:18:43 
MS. JACKSON:  Owen Harris [phonetic].  
Mm-hmm, because he'll be in some of 
those papers, but Owen Harris was the 
judge and once he decided, come made 
his decision, he ordered them to 
integrate and one thing he said, 
there will no longer be two buses 
riding down the same route, one bus 
will pick up white and black and the 
school board, they like to jump out  
01:19:15 
of their seats and that's about it.  
John Walker [phonetic] was our 
lawyer.

coming, just had got his--and he had 
it together.  He had just come out of 
college or law school or whatever, 
but he did good.  He was doing great.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  Do you remember what he 
would say in the courtroom during 
this case?  
 
MS. JACKSON:  You know, I sure don't.   
 
INTERVIEWER:  Okay.   
01:19:55 
MS. JACKSON:  Those things - - he 
would do things like, "Well, you 
know, the nigger" so the judge, then 
Walker would have him say it right 
instead of having him say nigger.  
That was just kind of funny to me.  
Every time they'd go out of place 
he'd correct them.  But I really 
enjoyed the judge, because he ordered 
them--there would be no problem in  
01:20:29 
Marvell.  He said I'd go to any price 
to see that there would be no problem 
in Marvell.

MS. JACKSON:  It's just us and there 
wasn't any audience.  But they like 
to jump out their seat--they jumped 
and looked at each other, and so when 
we went on back to school, the buses, 
they had to stop at them, because you 
see, maybe a white person living here 
and then a black person there would 
see that one bus would come through 
to pick up the whites and then  
01:21:08 
there's a black bus and a white bus.  
And we used to watch for the school 
buses--let me know when the bus 
coming.  They'd just say "the bus 
coming" and they'd say "white or 
black?"  And one day my son said--  
 
[background noise]

somebody's always watching for the 
bus to let us know when it's coming 
and then they say "The bus coming."

REVEREND JEROME TURNER:  --Poplar 
Grove, Arkansas, that's a few miles 
east of Marvell, Arkansas and it's 
located in the county of Phillips, 
Arkansas and it's close to the 
Mississippi River, close to Helena, 
West Helena area, and that's what I 
do here at BGACDC, and of course 
BGACDC stands for Boys Girls Adult 
Community Development Center.  I am  
01:23:35 
the youth and family director here at 
BGACDC. 
 
INTERVIEWER:  And what kind of 
activities go on here in this--  
 
REVEREND TURNER:  Well, we have 
three--four component areas in which 
we have activities here at BGACDC.  
Of course, those four component areas 
are we have youth and family 
services, we have an economic  
01:24:01 
development area, and of course we 
have housing, and of course there's 
an administrative area, but in

housing we have what we call the 
BGACDC Manor which is a family  
01:24:17 
dwelling.  It's for low-income 
housing project, and at that location 
there are some one, two and three-
bedroom units and it is our housing 
project for the city of Marvell.  We 
also have some standalone housing, 
some units that are operated by the 
BGACDC and they are rental property 
housing at BGACDC, so one of our 
goals here is to provide decent and  
01:24:46 
affordable housing for low-income 
families and so we do that through 
that dwelling of family housings that 
we have here.  Then of course in our 
economic development part, we have 
here at BGACDC, we have what we call 
the best food in town--it's called 
the BFT, best food in town.  It 
provides some employment for persons 
working in the cafeteria type setting  
01:25:14 
and of course we do serve the best 
food in town.  Economic development 
also we provide in the summertime

some jobs for youth in the summertime 
and for some middle-aged persons.  We  
01:25:27 
actually call it an intergenerational 
type of program in the summertime--we 
have college students and we have 
some youth that are still in high 
school who are 16 and maybe older, 
they work a summer program here at 
BGACDC, so those are some of our 
economic development type programs.  
Here in the youth and family service 
type program, we offer afterschool  
01:25:54 
tutorial programs--we call it our 
Delta Reach and Teach Program.  Our 
Delta Reach and Teach Program is an 
afterschool program.  It is also a - 
- program that we have and what we do 
there, we have some peer tutors and 
we have of course an - - that is a 
supervisor but we use high school 
students as peer tutors and we work 
with youth from ages of about 6 years  
01:26:17 
old up to about 14, and so we have 
them come over after school in the 
evening time.  Our program this year-

-in the past we've been operating at 
five days a week but we took a unique  
01:26:30 
approach this year, we're only 
operating three days a week because 
we are partnering with the Marvell 
school, the Marvell-Elaine school 
district and they are operating after 
school tutorial type programs Mondays 
and Tuesdays, and we operate 
Wednesdays and Thursdays, and so we 
took that approach that we might do a 
holistic approach to the students,  
01:26:51 
and we call them scholars or the 
students to help them--we offer the 
same opportunities that they would 
have found in school.  We have the 
same type of programs that we do in 
the afternoon that they would also go 
through at the school site.  So 
that's part of what we do in the 
youth and family services, and youth 
and family services also, we offer in  
01:27:15 
the summertime, we're partnered with 
a couple of partners--USDA and FDA, 
we're partnered to do what we call

Project, it is a project with some 
scholars or students and with their 
parents who--it's a volunteer-type 
project, and we have them assigned up 
and we are finding out some things 
about those of us who live here in 
the delta.  We have also found in our 
Delta Research Project, we've found 
out that we're deficient in vitamin 
D.  Even though we have plenty of  
01:27:52 
sunlight, but it appears that either 
we are not getting out in sunlight or 
we're staying in the house more, or 
we're not drinking that fortified 
milk with vitamin D in it, and so 
through our research project we have 
found out that in our area here, that 
vitamin D is one of our deficiencies 
so we'll work in our Delta Research 
Project trying to improve that by  
01:28:14 
offering a program in the summertime 
where we offer kids some holistic 
meals, some nutrition-full meals,

Mrs. Gertrude Jackson.  She is up in 
age, and I'm not going to tell you 
how old she is--I hope you don't film 
that, because I think I've really 
forgotten what actually her age is, 
but I know for sure she is in her  
01:29:08 
80s, for sure, and she has been here 
with us since the '70s, actually 
since about '78, '77 timeframe.

community development center here, 
BGACDC, a viable part of the 
community and a necessity in the 
community.  She has worked to do 
that.  She is a person who goes out

talking about BGACDC.  She and a 
couple of other community persons, 
one of them being Mr. Gale Thrower,  
01:29:52 
he's no longer with us, he's passed 
on--the two of them take it on 
themselves along with some other 
community persons to establish this 
place here because they were looking 
for an opportunity in providing 
things for boys and girls in our 
community, and then of course they 
also said that they wanted adults 
involved so that's how we came up  
01:30:15 
with the name Boys Girls Adults 
Community Development Center, because 
they looked at not only do we want

your boys and girls but we also want 
you as a parent to be involved also,  
01:30:25 
and so they came up with that slogan, 
that name to name this place.  At 
that time, they were just looking for 
an opportunity for persons in the 
community to have some place to go 
and something to do but as it 
developed and things began to 
progress, they began to take on more 
ideas, an idea of course having 
available affordable housing, an idea  
01:30:51 
of also providing economic 
development for people in the 
community, so they began to develop 
and take on those ideas.

REVEREND TURNER:  Over the last 20

years this center has had a great 
impact in the lives of maybe some

hundreds of young people and many of 
those young persons have went on from 
this place, some of them to become

them to become lawyers and doctors  
01:31:32 
and to do well and they will tell you 
that it is because they were involved 
in some type of either boys program 
or girls program here at the center.  
We have a program called Girls Are 
Girls.  We have a problem called Dad, 
which is dealing with boys, dealing 
with adolescent development, and 
those programs are programs that have 
been mentor programs that have helped  
01:31:53 
some of those persons throughout 
their lives.  And we had just here 
recently in our banquet that we had 
just the other day, it was on 
November the 10th--we had one of our 
young persons who had grown up here 
at the BGACDC, to come back--Marcus 
Thrower.  He is of course the son of 
Mr. Gale Thrower, but he is in 
Atlanta now and he is an investment  
01:32:20 
consultant, so that's the type of 
quality of persons who have come 
through this place.  We have several

has come through this place.  Our  
01:32:34 
executive director, one of her 
daughters is a lawyer who has come 
through BGACDC right here, so those 
are some of the positive things that 
this center has done, and even though 
those who may not have achieved that 
level of being a lawyer or a doctor 
or an investment banker and things of 
that nature, we have several

shouldn't have been up speaking so

this business on me, but I appreciate

would look to say that she would want

INTERVIEWER:  What makes her so 
wonderful?  
 
REVEREND TURNER:  Well, I think it's 
her willingness to give 100% in 
whatever she's doing, and that she 
looks and sees the good in people and 
not necessarily the bad.  I think 
that makes her a wonderful person.  
She can always find good in every 
person and believes that each  
01:34:23 
individual has some good in them.

there was a young man at the meeting

tonight and I didnâ€™t see him anymore 
until about 10 or 15 years later, 
right?  And I said that's the man--
that's the same one I saw at the 
meeting that night, and it turned out 
to be him and I knew he was going to 
be great.  I told him, I said, I 
guess - - you stood out that night 
and I just couldn't forget him.  
That's the man and I said I know he's  
01:35:29 
good for us because God just put him 
in my eyesight because I don't know 
if I would have taken that much time

I could just see something in him, 
and didn't see him no more until

grown then.  Okay, and that's all I 
wanted to say about Reverend Turner.  
And he just--and we're trying to get 
him to become, our director has 
gotten tired, she's just holding on, 
trying to get him to accept but he's 
doing fine.  He's not sure he wants

that was the first thing she wanted,  
01:26:35 
housing, and so we just went to work.  
They went to work on housing and went 
to FHA and thatâ€™s who built them, 
FHA, and when we got it all set up, 
it took a long time, and once we got 
it, then you have to have open house, 
you know, let the community know what 
you're doing, and so that day there 
was packed out around here, and I 
come in that morning and all these  
01:37:07 
white folks are there.  They came in 
to stop it.  They said they didn't 
want no housing project here because 
it brings drugs in the community, and 
so the mayor was a sweet little white 
lady--in other words, I won't go 
there, though.  But anyway, we had to 
overcome that.  They were trying to 
stop it because a housing project 
wasn't good for a community, they  
01:37:34 
say, but we wanted it.  The first 
place we planned to put it, they 
weren't selling and so when the white

want to have a--they wanted it back 
and we wanted it on the highway where

it, that we had to really fight to

MS. JACKSON:  I think it's 39 units.  
And I think we have 20 some units 
across town, you know.  Okay, that's 
it.  
01:38:41 
INTERVIEWER:  Okay, thank you.  
 
MS. JACKSON:  Mm-hmm.

MR. THEODORE ELDRIDGE CHILLING:  
Theodore Eldridge Chilling [phonetic] 
here and I'm a grandson of Miss  
01:39:08 
Gertrude Jackson.  Her oldest 
daughter, Juanita, is my mother.  I 
work for a USDA farm service agency 
now, and I actually work with all the 
farm commodity programs, disaster 
programs throughout Phillips County 
which is, since Miss Gertrude is a 
landowner, farmer out--I kind of 
oversee her land for the government 
as well.  But it's kind of--I don't  
01:39:42 
know what word I'm actually wanting 
right now, but my grandfather used to 
farm here and his brother, I guess at

the age of 11, I was helping farm, 
per se.  It was more of a hobby for  
01:39:54 
me, fun, because I got to drive 
tractors at a very young age and we 
spent a lot of time with my 
grandmother and grandfather spending 
the night, be at work, be ready to go 
like 5:30 in the morning, so I've 
been around farming a long time.   
 
INTERVIEWER:  And say a little bit 
more about what it was like to be out 
working with your elders in the  
01:40:25 
earth.  
 
MR. ELDRIDGE CHILLING:  Yeah, I guess 
the main thing I can remember now--
they were all great storytellers that 
kind of the reason I've heard a lot 
of the stories that Miss Gertrude has 
shared, I've heard variations or 
something about it, a lot of new 
stories also, but they were great 
storytellers and it never came off  
01:40:48 
negative or someone did this or to me 
or we're victims.  It was more like, 
this is just what happened.  We woke

up one day, this had happened and 
this is what we did to get over that,  
01:41:02 
but it wasn't anything ugly or nasty 
about the stories that I heard as far 
as retaliation.  That had just come 
with the times, so I kind of got 
their perspective as far as just 
another day.   
 
INTERVIEWER:  So how do you think 
those stories shaped you, who you are 
and how you live your life?  
 
MR. ELDRIDGE CHILLING:  Well, you  
01:41:29 
know, not being a victim--you just go 
out and whatever you want, you make 
your own way.  You ask anybody you 
think you need to for help, but you 
know, you're not really--or I don't 
per se wait or require any help, but 
I don't look at it as I can go talk 
to one person; I can't go talk to 
this group or that person.  It's 
just, you get up, this is what you  
01:41:56 
want to do, you go about it the best 
way you know how and whatever 
obstacle may get in your way, you

INTERVIEWER:  What impact would you 
say your grandmother has had on this 
community?  
 
MR. ELDRIDGE CHILLING:  Well, it's 
funny but I guess the awareness, per 
se, and the opportunity from the way 
she describes it nonchalantly, I had 
a thought to help kids but in that 
it's been hundreds and hundreds of 
kids and families that she's affected  
01:42:35 
just from having the idea and then 
maybe someone taking her idea and 
building a wall, making it concrete, 
something that people can come to and 
anyone from the Marvell area that 
wants, you know, they might ask who 
am I and who's my family, so I can 
say well, my other--on my father's 
side, I'm an Eldridge, they may or 
may not know, but if I say I'm a

INTERVIEWER:  Absolutely.  
 
MS. JACKSON:  What I want to say 
about the center--it's a meeting

recreation here, just every holiday, 
it's just the only place and it'll be 
packed out, and our little ladies--
you should have seen the decoration 
for, what's the night, Halloween?  
 
MR. ELDRIDGE CHILLING:  Yeah.  
 
MS. JACKSON:  Boy, they had the hair-
-but it was great and they wouldn't 
wait until night, they wanted to get 
it over at night before night, but it  
01:44:05 
was just better--I wish they could 
have taken a picture of that.  And

things, they decorate it different to 
meet the occasion but the only place  
01:44:15 
we had a meeting, so I just wanted to 
say that it would be packed all 
around.

any place to go.  
 
MR. ELDRIDGE CHILLING:  No.  
 
MS. JACKSON:  The only place.  
 
INTERVIEWER:  And why is it so 
important for this community to have  
01:44:33 
such a place?  
 
MS. JACKSON:  Very important, because 
we wouldn't have anywhere except a 
school--then you have to pay to use 
the--because it was growing so until-
-and then, okay, let me tell this.  
They wouldn't have any parking place.  
We used to have parking place, but 
after the highway came through, 
couldn't park at all, couldnâ€™t but  
01:44:55 
one car get out there, and so they 
just have all--I lost that thought, 
what I was going to say before that.

something?  
 
INTERVIEWER:  How tight a community 
is this?  
 
MS. JACKSON:  - - Turn in here.   
 
MR. ELDRIDGE CHILLING:  It's not as 
tight as it needs to be, but this 
center is an example of when the 
community was tight and from Miss  
01:45:33 
Gertrude having been one of the 
founders or one of the primary 
responsible parties for getting this 
center up, since everything that the 
minorities did had to come through 
here, there's the only place--they 
associate this place with her.  But 
the community was tight as far as 
this is one example of when they came 
together and did something for  
01:46:01 
themselves by themselves and it's 
still standing.  I think because it's 
not--we're not tight now, we don't

INTERVIEWER:  Good question.  My

starting community centers in other 
communities across and nearby.   
 
MR. ELDRIDGE CHILLING:  I don't know.   
01:46:51 
I don't know.   
 
INTERVIEWER:  All right.  
 
MS. JACKSON:  No, we don't have any 
other.  
 
MR. ELDRIDGE CHILLING:  No, the West 
Helena area has a Boys & Girls Club,  
but it's maybe less than five years 
old, so this was the only center of 
its kind, per se--maybe a 25, even 50 
mile radius.  So I don't know how  
01:47:17 
many of those cities actually came 
here, but the smaller communities, 
which used to be quite a nice

MS. JACKSON:  It was just kind of 
like--I can't find the word, but it's 
just like, just out there, just in 
action--I enjoyed it.  What's the 
word for that?  It wasn't fear.  I 
guess that's the most thing I could 
say--I would never fear for a friend.  
 
MR. ELDRIDGE CHILLING:  I can 
personally say that I have never  
01:49:01 
heard a negative story or anything 
about fear, it was almost like an 
afterthought because when you read 
your history books and because this 
story wasn't publicized in the area--
I went to the Helena school district 
20 miles away, we read in the history 
books.  I'm like, my family went 
through that but it was an 
afterthought.  I didn't know how  
01:49:29 
serious it was because it wasn't 
talked to in the way that we have to 
be careful or this is what happened

you are because of so-and-so.  We  
01:49:43 
started the center and we helped 
people and you know, you don't get 
the gist of it, but this is going on 
when Martin Luther King and other 
people are dying for the very same 
things that they're going through but 
it just doesn't hit home as being

REVEREND TURNER:  Yeah.  Well, yes, I  
01:50:37 
do think that there are other centers 
that have been influenced from 
BGACDC.  You have in Marianna, 
Arkansas, it's a center there and 
it's called the Lee County Community 
Development Center, I think it is, in 
Marianna.  They were influenced and 
what I mean by influenced is because 
Mrs. Beatrice Shelby, executive 
director and Mrs. Gertrude Jackson  
01:51:01 
have been influenced, have been some 
influential women in our community 
that other women in other communities 
have seen the things that they 
produced here in Marvell, and have 
begun to work in their communities to 
the same, and I would say that 
Marianna area which is in Lee County 
here in Arkansas, and then there are 
several areas over in Mississippi.   
01:51:25 
We were part of an Arkansas, 
Mississippi and a Louisiana 
collaborative one time, part of the

Foundation of Midsouth, and so there 
were several other communities that  
01:51:38 
were influenced by the things that 
had transpired right here in Marvell, 
Arkansas.  Here in our recent, just a 
couple of years ago, our school 
system partnered--well, our school 
system had to take on another 
community.  It used to just be the 
Marvell community and now it's the 
Marvell-Elaine community and so there 
are persons in Elaine now thinking  
01:52:01 
about how they can have a community 
development center or some type of 
community center there in the Marvell 
area, so I would say that there are 
plenty of places that we have 
traveled around Arkansas and 
Louisiana and Mississippi and even 
maybe even in some other areas who 
have taken their thoughts from what 
we do right here at BGACDC.  And it's  
01:52:24 
all because, like I say, we have a 
great ambassador in Mrs. Jackson and 
of course our executive director--
