A friend on Facebook who writes about Jewish culture told me about Shuly Wigs. I 
had been driving in the area scouting salons and I saw their sign but it was a 
Saturday so they were closed for Shabbat. A couple of weeks later I called the 
salon and spoke with Minky, an employee, and she invited me to come and see the 
shop. I asked her if I could interview the owner, Shuly and she said she would call 
her and ask her to come in.  
 
I arrived around noon. The wig shop was very clean and modern inside. While we 
were waiting for Shuly to arrive I interviewed Minky. She was a young, recently 
divorced Orthodox Jewish woman. She talked about the clientele at the salon and 
about the practice of Orthodox women covering their hair. Under the direction of 
her Rabbi, she still chose to cover her hair even though she wasn’t currently 
married. Minky showed me the different wig lines they produced along with those 
that were being repaired and those that were in the shop for maintenance. 
 
After our interview, while waiting for Shuly to arrive, I photographed the shop. 
Soon after, Shuly arrived with her husband. We walked into her office in the back 
and conducted the interview. Shuly was warm, open and excited to talk about her 
business. She started the business as a small operation out of her home and 
currently runs a retail and wholesale operation. She talked about celebrities and 
housewives alike who are passionate about the quality and comfort of her wigs. 
Her husband was present during the entire interview. I left around 3:30pm.
