MR:  A couple years ago I was a presenter at a healing conference. All the women in attendance 
were wearing beautiful beaded earrings and exquisite ribbon skirts. One statement in my talk 
was “Healing isn’t always pretty. You all look so lovely, you truly do. However, when we heal, 
we cry and our eyes puff up, our noses run, and if we are healing rage our faces contort into 
snarls. Healing isn’t always pretty.” Along came Covid-19 and the quarantine that accompanies 
it. Then the murder of George Floyd and resulting revolutionary actions. A number of arts 
agencies and programs asked for artwork about surviving the pandemic and civil unrest. My 
first response was, “As native people this isn’t our first pandemic and it certainly isn’t our first 
war.” One Native organization asked for a Native response to both incidences. As a writer, not a 
visual artist, I wrote the poem “Resilience.” I think that often our resilience is romanticized by 
others—we become these strong, stoic ‘Indians.’ The original title for this unpublished poem 
was “Resilience Isn’t Always Pretty.”
