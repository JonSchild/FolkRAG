Transcript of Interview with Taiwo Ogunbekun, May 26, 2021 
By Ethan Sharp 
Ethan (00:03): 
Okay. It looks like we're good to go. This is Ethan Sharp. It's May 26th, 2021. I'm here at the recovery 
community center in Nicholasville, Kentucky. And I'm here with Tai. Would you introduce yourself, Tai? 
Taiwo (00:20): 
Hi, I'm Taiwo Ogunbekun. I'm a peer support at the Shepherd's House Recovery Community Center in 
Nicholasville, Kentucky. 
Ethan (00:28): 
Okay, great. So just to start us off, Tai, could you tell us a little bit about your background, where you were 
born, where you grew up, and then maybe share a little bit about your personal journey through recovery? 
Taiwo (00:41): 
Yeah. I actually am first-generation. My dad is from Nigeria. He came here when he was about 25 years 
old. He married my mom. They both went to the same university, so that's how they met. And they had 
myself and my brother. We're twins, and my sister is about a year older than me or us. And we were born 
in Toledo, Ohio, and that's where I grew up. I actually had a pretty good childhood. I went to private 
school, Christian private school. My parents divorced when I was one, and they both were remarried by 
the time I was five. So that was interesting. And there was a lot of abuse in our home, a lot of physical 
abuse, emotional abuse. And then, we were the perfect blended family at church. So it was kind of a 
combination of that facade, and that was how I grew up, was just a complete facade. 
Ethan (01:51): 
Can I shut that? 
Taiwo (01:51): 
Yeah. I didn't know he was going to do that. 
Ethan (01:51): 
So was your, was your, your mother was from Nigeria as well? 
Taiwo (01:58): 
My mom is from Southeast Michigan. She grew up in Southeast Michigan. She's Irish and Scandinavian. 
And my dad is from Nigeria, so that's where my name comes from and the complexion. 
Ethan (02:13): 
That's very cool. And then can you tell us a little bit about your adolescence, and then where you went to 
school? 
Taiwo (02:22): 
2 
 
Yeah, I went to school at Toledo Christian and Harvest Lane Christian Academy there in Toledo, Ohio, and 
I went there from kindergarten to eighth grade, and then I went to Toledo Christian, from freshman year 
to senior year. I actually got kicked out, and I had to go to a public school for one semester of my senior 
year. So that was very interesting. It was definitely a culture shock for me. There was like a stabbing my 
first week, and I never went back. Yeah, in the public school, I just, I, I literally was like, I'm doing everything 
from home, so you guys can either get on board or fail me. And they were just like, whatever, we'll just 
pass you because you've been a good student your whole life. 
Ethan (03:16): 
So could you tell, would you mind telling us a little bit about how you, you had substance use issues 
starting in high school? 
Taiwo (03:27): 
Yes, actually, it started in high school. I was considered a huffer. I would huff spray paint. I actually saw it 
in a movie, and then I ended up doing it. So, you know, I'm actually very conscious of that nowadays 
because I don't expose my kids to stuff like that, because it gives them ideas, basically. Because I know 
how easy that is to then do it in your own life. And then I drank of course, as, as a young kid, about 16, 17, 
and you know, it wasn't out of control. Like when I drank, I drank to get drunk. But I wasn't like drinking 
every day. So by the time I was a senior, I kinda got my, my life a little bit straighter and graduated and 
then went off to college. And then, in college, I met my son's father, and that's when I kinda went off the 
rails, when heroin was introduced, cocaine was introduced, and it just went from there. I was probably 
about 21 at that time. And then the addiction started about 22. 
Ethan (04:44): 
Okay. And that started in college? And you were able to-- 
Taiwo (04:48): 
Finish school. Yeah. And that was just by the grace of God. 
Ethan (04:54): 
And then what, how did, how did you come to Kentucky? 
Taiwo (05:01): 
I actually got arrested in Fayette County, and I was about six months pregnant with my twin girls. And I 
was not doing what I needed to do. I was in active addiction. I was in the madness, and I just got arrested. 
And when I went to court they were going to let me out, no big deal. It was my first charge in my life. They 
were just going to actually dismiss it because the charge was receiving stolen property, and that stolen 
property was my mom's car. So it was my mom that called the police on me. So they were just going to 
dismiss it as a family feud and just let it go. And then my mom came to court and asked for help for me. 
And I got lucky enough, I had Judge Goodman and she was, she's a drug court judge. So she was like, all 
right, well, we're not going to let her out. And they gave me an option of sitting and waiting for the 
indictment or going to drug court. And I was so far in my pregnancy, I had to choose drug court, but I also 
chose drug court to better myself. I had no idea what drug court was. I had no idea what I was getting 
myself into. But I wanted something different, and I was so desperate at that time that I was like, fine, I'll 
just do whatever you want me to do. 
3 
 
Ethan (06:27): 
So this was two and a half years ago. 
Taiwo (06:28): 
Yeah. Two and a half years ago. 
Ethan (06:31): 
So you were just visiting from Ohio? 
Taiwo (06:32): 
Yeah. I was just visiting and then ended up getting arrested. So I've been here two and a half years. 
Ethan (06:41): 
Yeah. Wow. So can you tell us a little bit about your experience with drug court and your twins being born 
during that? 
Taiwo (06:48): 
My, my twins, I actually got out of jail. I only spent about 34 days in jail, and I went to Chrysalis House 
after that. And it was a good experience. It felt like home. I found a really good group of family, friends. 
And I had my daughters. They were medically fragile and had a lot of issues. You know, that could have 
been from the drugs. That could have just been from being twins. It's really not known, but I carry a lot of 
guilt from it. And so they stayed in the hospital for about two weeks and social services got involved. And 
at first, it was gonna just be like very extensive and them just watching me. And for some reason, 
somebody just decided, no, we're putting them in foster care. Yeah. In about 24 hours, they went from 
them coming home with me to foster care. And I was devastated. Coming from my family, foster care was 
just never an option, you know, like we just weren't people that that happened to. So it was so 
embarrassing and devastating. You know, and it didn't take long. I just kept pushing and pushing and 
pushing. And so about a month later they were like, okay, well, it seems like you're doing all right, and 
we'll just give them back. And I wasn't doing all right. I was still a facade. I wasn't working on myself. I was 
just trying to push, push through, and get to the end goal that I wanted. And it just so happened, did not 
give them my prescription, and thought that I was going to outsmart them. I was still in the old ways, still 
in the old thinking. And I just wasn't desperate or willing enough to really change yet. And they found out. 
It took them like a day to find out because they're not stupid. 
Taiwo (09:02): 
And so from there, you know, they kicked me out, and that, that was even more devastating. And I had 
absolutely nowhere to go. You know, and like, I didn't get to see my girls for three weeks, and they're 
newborns. So that was, it chokes me up thinking about it, because it was really, really hard. But they sent 
me to another rehab in Richmond, and those people loved me back to life. And I was, I became desperate. 
I became willing. And finally, finally, just was like, all right, I'll just cut the bull crap. I'll just do what you 
want me to do. And it was there, about the end of my 30 days there, that social services finally was like, 
okay, we see that you're changing. We see that things are getting better. We'll start transitioning them 
back to you. It was a very slow transition. It was a lot of ups and downs. Cause even when I was doing 
what I was supposed to be doing, they still wanted me to jump through a lot of hoops. So it took about 
six months. The girls were about seven months by the time I got them back full-time. And I had been 
4 
 
through, I was, graduated from the rehab in Richmond, and then I was about to graduate from Chrysalis. 
So it took a long time. It was a lot of the journey that I didn't have them. But in that, it was better that 
way, because they were loved by people that I love now. I mean, they're still part of their lives. They're 
their godparents. They have them two, three times a week. When I work till eight o'clock here, they have 
them, you know. 
Taiwo (11:00): 
They're the people that I trust the most with them. So it was kind of a God thing, how it all worked out, 
because they were my nemesis in the beginning, you know. I hated them more than I hated social services. 
But it worked out where it was just like they love the girls as much as I love the girls. You know, they love 
my son as much as I love my son. And it's just, I would never have had that, had it not happened. It was 
hard, and it was hard fought, but it was, it was definitely worth it. So by the time I graduated from 
Chrysalis, I got the girls back. And you know, Amanda and Tyler really didn't think I was going to let them 
stay involved. However, I was very diligent about that. I was like, whenever you want them, you have 
them. Like they're yours, they're mine. You know, you got them through the hardest part of their early 
lives, all the doctor's appointments, everything that I couldn't do, you did. So they're still involved to this 
day. They actually are picking them up today from daycare. 
Taiwo (12:20): 
So, yeah, I graduated I stayed home with the girls. Well, I worked at Cracker Barrel for a few months in 
2020, in 2019 as well. Like, it was the end of 2019 to the beginning of 2020. And then COVID hit, and I 
stayed home with the girls. And it just so happened that drug court let me do that because of the girls 
being medically fragile. And then in May of 2020, I got my son back. He was with my mom. And so he's 
been with me for over a year now. And in June, I got another job. I worked there for about eight months, 
and then things just weren't going very well. Like they, they were okay financially. They were okay during 
the day and stuff, but I wasn't doing anything that helped my recovery. I was barely making it through 
drug court. I was just toughing it out. White knuckling it. And you know, it was at my doctor's office. They 
asked me like, did you ever think of peer support? They're just like, you have a story that could help a lot 
of people. And you know, you have kind of the drive that could really help a lot of people. And so I was 
like, all right, I'll do that. Let's just see where that goes. And within a week, I got my peer support. About 
three days later, I got hired here. And then, yeah, it just kind of, it was like this snowball effect. And I was 
in the right place at the right time. It was kind of like, God's like, all right, you're ready. Let's go. Let's do 
this. And then I met Steven and it, and like, then inducted into the board. And it was just like, okay. 
Ethan (14:23): 
One thing after the other. 
Taiwo (14:25): 
Yeah. 
Ethan (14:25): 
So you did the training for the peer support in 2020? 
Taiwo (14:32): 
2021. It was March of 2021. 
5 
 
Ethan (14:34): 
Oh, just March of this year. Wow. Okay. So very recent. 
Taiwo (14:36): 
Yeah. Very recently. 
Ethan (14:37): 
I thought it was last year, but that's--so where did you do your training? 
Taiwo (14:48): 
I did my training with New Vista, and thankfully, it was over Zoom. So I could be home with my kids and 
still pay attention. So that was definitely a godsend. And I actually did my family peer support the end of 
April. And then my youth peer support, I will be finishing in two weeks. So I'm very excited to get that last 
tenet of all the peer supports done. 
Ethan (15:18): 
And the family you did that through New Vista as well? 
Taiwo (15:20): 
I did that through GoHire in Hazard. 
Ethan (15:24): 
And the youth you're doing through? 
Taiwo (15:25): 
Through GoHire in Hazard. Yeah. 
Ethan (15:31): 
Is that a recovery organization? 
Taiwo (15:34): 
They are. They're kind of like, you know, Bluegrass. They're kind of Bluegrass. 
Ethan (15:41): 
Okay. Yeah. Wow. That's, that's amazing. So, so this is all sort of new in some ways for you? 
Taiwo (15:50): 
Yes. Yeah. Like I've worked with peer support for years now. You know, I honestly thought it was a lot 
harder to get, and that I was just not going to be qualified for it. And when they're like, no, you're qualified, 
you know. You just got to sit through the training and, and you know, pass the test and everything. I was 
like, what? 
Ethan (16:14): 
6 
 
That's great. So you can, maybe you can, we can talk about sort of how peer support specialists helped 
you. I don't know if they had a role in your recovery. 
Taiwo (16:28): 
They did. 
Ethan (16:29): 
And then were you also a peer mentor at some point? 
Taiwo (16:36): 
Yeah. I was actually a peer mentor at Chrysalis, so I wasn't certified yet, but I was a peer mentor there. 
And that helped me a great deal because, you know, when we, these women come in from rehab, they're 
coming in from all walks of life, you know. But they're desperate. They're hungry. They're willing, and they 
want a change in their life. And, you know, when you're at the end of your process at Chrysalis and still 
on your journey of recovery, it's vital to see these things, to still be in touch with that desperate, that 
desperate nature, because at any point you can forget. And once you forget, you're headed back to 
relapse, and you don't even realize it. And that's what's a great thing about working here and working 
with people who are right off the street, because it's like, you know, they, they just got you know--I forgot 
what I was just going to say. They just got into probation or parole. You know, and they just got referred 
here. And so it's like, they're there, they have no idea what to do, other than they're an addict, and they 
need help. And so it's like seeing that and helping them navigate is so vital to my own recovery, just so 
that I can keep in touch with, okay, this is the reality. It's not the fascination of what you want to think the 
past was like. It's this. So keep this at the forefront of your mind, and you'll be okay. Cause relapse, it 
comes out of nowhere. We just had a staff member relapse, and you know, he didn't own up to it. And it 
was hard for all of us, because it's just like, what? This is real. Like, this can come out of nowhere. And 
then you, you just got to either own up to it and keep going or stay in your delusion. And it's just, it's 
difficult. It's difficult to see it happen to somebody, let alone that person actually going through it. 
Ethan (18:45): 
Yeah. And so at Chrysalis house, that was like a seventh month process? 
Taiwo (18:52): 
It actually is about a year. But it took me about seven months because I was so willing to be done. I had 
been through Chrysalis Court, their one house. And then I was there, I was there for about three months. 
Then I went to Richmond for a month, and then I went to their Bull Lea House. So I was ready to be done. 
I had been in rehab for about a year, so they kind of pushed me through. 
Ethan (19:22): 
And then they moved you into a peer mentor role? 
Taiwo (19:24): 
Yes. At the end. They usually like you to be at least eight to ten months sober or in their program. Usually 
both. I was about a year sober, so they just kind of switched one for the other. 
Ethan (19:42): 
7 
 
And early in your process, did peer support specialists really make a difference for you? 
Taiwo (19:49): 
It wasn't the peer support at Chrysalis that helped. It was the peer support at my doctor's office that just 
so happened to be next door. They're the ones that helped me the most, because it was just like, you 
know, I had OCD, ADD, you know, major depressive disorder, and you know, I never heard anybody speak 
on these matters the way they did and be so open, so honest. And it was like, oh, so I'm not so weird. Like 
these are not strange thoughts, you know, and this is how you can combat these thoughts. And that's 
what helped me get through that last part of my transition at Chrysalis, was just like, okay, this is what, 
this is how a successful person in recovery acts. This is what they do. You know, they have the same 
diagnosis as I do. So maybe I just emulate them. And that's what I did for quite a while. 
Ethan (20:50): 
And you had like one-on-one sessions with them? 
Taiwo (20:53): 
Yes. And that's what really helped. You know, a therapist is great, and all the education in the world can 
be awesome. But somebody who's lived it, who knows it, and who can encourage you through it, it's a 
hundred times better. You know, it's like, they don't have to have the same education. The education 
really doesn't affect that participant as much as the experience does. And that's where a lot of the change 
ends up happening is through a person that has already experienced it and can encourage them through 
it. 
Ethan (21:33): 
Having that shared experience, that's key. Well, maybe, we could just take a step back and talk a little bit, 
you said, you went to a Christian school, and religion was an important part of your life growing up. So 
has that also been an important part of your recovery? 
Taiwo (21:58): 
Finding a god of my understanding has been a vital part of my recovery. I was so desensitized to religion, 
because I had been exposed to it since I was literally six months old. So by then, it was like, oh, okay, we 
pray, we sing, we listen to the preacher, and that's it. You know, and then at school, you pray, you listen 
to the preacher, and that's it. And by ten, I was well desensitized. And it took a long time, it took probably 
about another 20 years, to figure out a god of my understanding that wasn't my parents' god. At this point 
in my recovery, my god is between Odin and Jesus. So I have, I'm very strong in my Scandinavian heritage. 
And then I still believe in Jesus and the Trinity and everything like that, but it's like a mix for me. 
Ethan (23:09): 
Yeah. I understand. I was just curious, because you said it was an important part of your life growing up. 
So I was wondering, you know, how, how that kind of played out in your recovery. 
Taiwo (23:21): 
Yeah. It's, it's a big part of my recovery. At Chrysalis the second time is when I kind of started finally figuring 
it out, working the steps. And the step three was probably the hardest one for me, even though step four 
is all the work. So step three was like, okay, so I can have this God that I can submit to. And it can be a 
8 
 
combination of Odin or Freya or Thor, but it also can be God the Father. It also can be Jesus or the Holy 
Spirit. And so like culminating that religion of my own, it was really what helped me get through the steps, 
get through my own challenges and to where I'm at today. 
Ethan (24:17): 
Yeah. Is that something you share with other peers? 
Taiwo (24:21): 
If people ask me, I'll tell them what I believe in, but I usually try to keep it to myself because most people 
have no idea who Odin is. You know, we're in America. It's not like I'm in Sweden right now. I would love 
to be in Sweden right now. 
Ethan (24:42): 
That would be nice. 
Taiwo (24:42): 
Yeah. So nobody really understands it. So I'm just like, I'll just keep it to myself. 
Ethan (24:49): 
Well, I only know because my kids read the Norse mythology books, and they tell me about it. 
Taiwo (24:55): 
I love reading Norse mythology. 
Ethan (24:58): 
That's really, that's really cool. When you were going through drug court, do you do some things as a peer 
support or as a peer mentor, not as some sort of certified peer support specialist, but do you get some 
training in peer support? 
Taiwo (25:15): 
Usually, you have like a newer person who will be attached to you. You know, they'll be like, hey, you 
know, befriend this person, help them get through the first phase, second phase. I had probably about 
three or four mentees through my two years. Yeah. So, and then, you know, you have a lot of the workers 
themselves are in recovery. That's, Fayette does a great job of that. They hire those in recovery. So, you 
know, that's not the case in every other county. It's a lot of people who like to judge you, you know, even 
in Jessamine, that's, that's what ends up happening. So it's, it's an amazing thing to see, okay, you've got 
12 years, you've got 20 years in recovery. This is doable, you know. Like I'll, I'll get there eventually. And 
they're balanced, and they're successful, and you know, it's like, okay. 
Ethan (26:20): 
These are the folks working in drug court. 
Taiwo (26:22): 
Yeah. And it's just like, wow. 
9 
 
Ethan (26:27): 
Yeah. That's awesome. Well, maybe we can talk about what you're doing here, and now that you've got 
the certification. 
Taiwo (26:38): 
Yeah. Having the certification, really it's, it's kind of just a title. Because you're drawing on so much of your 
own experience. Like, you know, they teach you how to set good boundaries, so that's vital. But you're 
drawing on so much of your own experience that it's like, this is what I've been doing for a couple of years 
now. So, you know, it's not much I can put on a resume, like, hey, in rehab, I was here mentoring, you 
know. But you know, it's, it's great. You know, we don't get a lot of females in just yet, because there's 
not, really the population doesn't know were here just yet. So it's a little bit more hard to use my skills, 
but we do have a lot of guys coming in, you know, and they need that female touch, of just somebody 
listening to them, that's not just scholastically qualified. And being able to be like, hey, yeah, I got two and 
a half years. You got six months, but you're going to get there. You know, you just got to keep going. 
Ethan (27:55): 
Can you tell us a little bit about what the recovery community center is? 
Taiwo (28:01): 
Yes. It's a new thing for Shepherd's House, where it's just like we offer job education, job training, GED, 
SMART recovery, Recovery Dharma, MARA, NA, AA, pretty much any type of recovery we offer it. And 
we're, we're, with all pathways. So however you are getting into recovery, because I know my own 
recovery, I had to use a maintenance, and I'm on my maintenance taper now. Not everybody can do that. 
You know, it's not accepted in a lot of rehabs. But that's what I needed for my recovery. And so that's 
what we try to offer here is just all pathways and help you build yourself, build your life. Be that extra 
support. Because there are two rehabs in Nicholasville, one female, one male, and we want to be that 
support for them, that sober support, where it's like, if you're having a horrible day, you can come here. 
You know, you don't have to stay around where you're upset. We're just that sober support that 
everybody basically needs. 
Ethan (29:28): 
So the other two facilities you mentioned are the Shepherd's House and-- 
Taiwo (29:31): 
Yeah. The Shepherd's house and, oh, you mean the two? 
Ethan (29:37): 
You said there were two here. 
Taiwo (29:37): 
Yeah. One is Stepworks, and one is Revive. So neither is owned by Shepherd's House. No. Shepherd's 
House is in Lexington right. There on Maxwelton, and there on Waller. Yeah. Their Maxwelton house is 
kind of the, the heart of everything, the core of our program. And then we have a female house we opened 
in Danville as well. So that's going to be hopefully the heart of that program as well. 
10 
 
Ethan (30:08): 
Okay. So the center is not necessarily to serve folks who, who come out of Shepherd's House? 
Taiwo (30:15): 
No. It's to serve everybody. Yeah. 
Ethan (30:19): 
Okay. So you, you coordinate with Stepworks and-- 
Taiwo (30:23): 
Stepworks, Revive, probation, drug court. Yeah. We just want to work with everybody, so that we can, 
they can utilize our services. And the services we already offer, it's like utilize these that way. When your 
participants need something else, you can actually help them with that, so that we can just be all a wrap-
around service. 
Ethan (30:51): 
Okay. And so the services that you provide are here in the building? So like you have the meetings-- 
Taiwo (31:00): 
Yeah. We have the meetings here. We have three meetings a day, noon, five and seven. We offer the GED 
program through adult education, but you can do everything here. We actually had a couple of people do 
their peer support here through New Vista, and they, it was all over Zoom. So they just did it here. You 
know, people come and write letters to their probation, to family court, what have you. But basically it's 
like anything you need, we'll help you figure it out. 
Ethan (31:35): 
Okay. That's awesome. So it's been open since-- 
Taiwo (31:41): 
March 15th. 
Ethan (31:43): 
Wow. Yeah. Very new. And, and the, and the idea of having it right here across, is there a, was there an 
idea? 
Taiwo (31:52): 
To make it accessible to everybody. Just with the commute, and like Nicholasville is very spread out. You 
know, you've got the rural areas and the trailer parks that are kind of like that way. So we're a little bit 
inaccessible to them, but the reason we're downtown is just to make it accessible to like all the 
participants of parole, probation, drug court, all of that. 
Ethan (32:18): 
Yeah. Yeah. So you do work with drug court. Do you have some kind of program where you work with 
them, or is it more like you go to drug, people who are coming out of drug court come to you for help? 
11 
 
Taiwo (32:31): 
We're working directly with drug court, and they've changed authority right now. So that, it's been a little 
bit slow with that, but hopefully, it'll be like drug court refers them here for their meetings and everything 
else that they need to do. 
Ethan (32:51): 
That's kind of what I was wondering. Yeah. Okay. So that's kind of in process. 
Taiwo (32:56): 
Yes. Because like one of the big tenets of drug court is to get your GED, you know, and you have three 
meetings a week, four meetings a week. You know, you can do all of that here. So that's why we're really 
trying to work with drug court. 
Ethan (33:12): 
Yeah. And so the, the, and your hope was that you would have more women to work with. 
Taiwo (33:21): 
Yeah. Which it's great working with the guys too, but you know, I know there's a lot of women out there 
that need help. So that's kind of where my heart's at. Especially with women who have children, and 
they're going through family court and stuff like that. Like I just, I want to be that example to them, like, 
hey, you can get through this. Like we can jump through the hoops and get through it. 
Ethan (33:45): 
Yeah. So can you talk about sort of like a typical week for you in terms of, do you run meetings or--what 
are your tasks? 
Taiwo (33:53): 
Yeah, it's kind of like, whoever comes in if they want AA meetings, if they want a MARA meeting, we'll 
tailor it to whoever comes in to make them feel the most comfortable, even though like we advertise an 
AA, NA, or something for the day. And then for everything else, like we do a lot of outreach, so we're 
always going out and looking and, you know, giving our business cards to businesses, any related fields, 
the jail. And then a lot of peer support with the guys. That's a big part of it. And I do a lot of taxes. A lot of 
the guys come in, and they didn't get their stimuluses. So I'm like, all right, let's do it. So I'm using my 
accounting a lot. 
Ethan (34:52): 
Yeah. That's cool. Do you do some one-on-one? 
Taiwo (34:59): 
Yeah, usually about one a day. 
Ethan (35:03): 
Okay. So just kind of whenever they're needing help or do you have sort of like a caseload you work with? 
12 
 
Taiwo (35:09): 
Yeah, it's usually like a caseload of guys that I'm working with, and then you know, when they come in, 
we try to like pull them to the side, and just get, get like one meeting in while they're here, and what's 
convenient for them. Because a lot of them work you know, till five. And so by the time that they are 
done, it's like, okay, you know, they need to do it at like seven and eight o'clock. 
Ethan (35:36): 
So you're open? 
Taiwo (35:37): 
We're open 9:00 to 8:00. 
Ethan (35:40): 
Wow. Yeah. Are you here? 
Taiwo (35:42): 
I'm here on Wednesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays until 8:00. 
Ethan (35:47): 
Wow. That's good. It's a lot of work for you, but it's good. 
Taiwo (35:52): 
It's hard having three little ones and being here until late. 
Ethan (35:55): 
But then the other days you have off or-- 
Taiwo (35:59): 
Till 5:00. Yeah. 
Ethan (36:01): 
Yeah. Wow. There was something I was going to ask about that, but I forgot. Yeah, I forgot what it was. It 
will come to me in a minute. So maybe we could move into sort of talking about sort of your vision for 
how things will develop here. And then we can kind of talk about maybe some challenges. 
Taiwo (36:42): 
We want to see where we're kind of the hub for everybody, and we can get them where they need to go. 
So, you know, the idea is to have at least like 20 to 30 participants a day. You know, full meetings, and you 
know, have at least a few people a day with adult education, job training, and utilizing at least every 
service, having a few people a day. So that's the ideal, what we're looking at. 
Ethan (37:19): 
Oh, I know what I was going to ask. Sorry. I was going to ask how many other peer support specialists do 
you have? 
13 
 
Taiwo (37:26): 
So there's Calissa. She's another female peer support, and then we have Blake, who's our program 
director. He's also a peer support, and Sean. He's a peer support. So there's four of us all together, two 
and two. 
Ethan (37:42): 
So that's all of your staff? 
Taiwo (37:43): 
Yes, that's all the staff. 
Ethan (37:44): 
And do you also have therapists come in? 
Taiwo (37:49): 
We don't have any therapists right now. Like at this moment, I'm getting my CADC. So hopefully in the 
next two years. Because it's not a quick process. 
Ethan (38:03): 
Yeah, I know. It takes a little bit longer. 
Taiwo (38:04): 
So I was, I'm going back to school in August, but I'm also getting my CADC, trying to do it at the same time. 
We'll see how well that works. But that's kind of the idea is to, to promote within. So we're all trying to 
kind of further our education a little bit. 
Ethan (38:26): 
So others are just doing kind of the same thing, you know, getting extra training and looking at other, like 
sort of moving up. 
Taiwo (38:36): 
Yeah, Exactly. 
Ethan (38:36): 
Okay. So as I said, the peer support profession, it's kind of new. I mean, it's growing a lot, so I just wanted 
to see if you could tell us some, what do you see as some of the, some of the, what do you see as being 
some of the major challenges or issues as it's growing? What are some things that need to be worked out? 
Taiwo (39:02): 
Some consistency issues. Because it's, it's hard when some programs are a little bit more in depth. Some 
aren't, and you, you know, you're pushing people out from all these programs. But there's no real 
consistency between them. 
Ethan (39:22): 
14 
 
You mean in the trainings? 
Taiwo (39:22): 
In the training. Yeah. I'm getting my national peer support, so that, which is very regulated, so that it, you 
know, I at least will know that my training is very consistent, and across the board, I know what I'm 
speaking about. 
Ethan (39:49): 
Who offers that, the national? 
Taiwo (39:50): 
It's a committee. I've not looked too much into it, but that's what I'm working on besides the TCADC, the 
temporary CADC. Yeah. With my degree, I can get the temporary CADC, and then get all my hours. 
Ethan (40:10): 
Awesome. Okay. But there's a national peer support training program that's more standardized-- 
Taiwo (40:19): 
Exactly. And then there's not too many. I think there's only like a few thousand in the United States that 
are nationally accredited. And so it's a big goal to try to get it done, but I definitely, I'm trying my hardest 
to do that. 
Ethan (40:43): 
And do you, do you foresee that the training programs that are offered here in Kentucky, do you think 
that they'll sort of standardize them more? 
Taiwo (40:56): 
I think they will. 
Ethan (40:57): 
Do you see a process taking place there? 
Taiwo (40:59): 
I do. I see a process kind of coming forth. Because you know, I went through a pretty strenuous program, 
and I'm grateful for that because it gave me a lot of tools that I didn't already have. And you know, you're 
starting to see the programs that are a little bit more strenuous are becoming a little bit more popular, 
and the ones that aren't and are not very standardized kind of dying out because they don't have enough 
people. So it's kind of regulating itself. 
Ethan (41:41): 
Okay, after this, we'll talk more about that. What are some other issues or challenges that you see, you 
know, sort of just in the, maybe the workplace for peer support specialist? 
Taiwo (41:57): 
15 
 
Boundaries is a big thing for, for the peer support, because you want to help somebody as much as 
possible, but at the same time, you can't, you can't go beyond your professional boundaries. And you 
know, I see that a lot, happening. It's usually never anybody in recovery that does it, but it's happening a 
lot. And you know, it ends up costing people their futures, their careers. 
Ethan (42:31): 
Is this sort of an issue of people acting more like a sponsee rather than a peer support? 
Taiwo (42:39): 
Yeah. Being very unprofessional, like--so you know, it's, it's just kinda like a line you have to remember 
that it's there. You know, and it's not just for vanity sake. It's there for a reason. And it's there to protect 
you. 
Ethan (43:02): 
What are some examples of sort of the boundaries issues? 
Taiwo (43:08): 
You know, like when you're working with inmates, you know, you've got to keep strenuous boundaries. 
You know, they can't be calling you little pet names. They can't, you know, be calling you outside of work. 
You know, things like that. It's just not acceptable. And you know, it's hard when you invest in somebody 
,and you want the best for them and keeping those boundaries and stuff. But it's just something that 
you've got to do. 
Ethan (43:42): 
Have you found that to be an issue of, sort of, sort of people having that experience of being a sponsee in 
AA and NA and then moving over to being a peer support specialist that they kind of, they get those roles 
confused. 
Taiwo (44:01): 
Yeah. And it's usually like those in recovery seem to have a little bit better boundaries versus those who 
are just scholastically there. 
Ethan (44:12): 
Yeah. Okay. So there are peer support specialists who don't have that experience with recovery? 
Taiwo (44:19): 
I would say they're not necessarily a peer support, more like a therapist or a CADC or some counselor, or 
something like that, who's not in recovery. 
Ethan (44:29): 
And you find that they have those kinds-- 
Taiwo (44:31): 
They have more issues with boundaries than somebody in recovery. 
16 
 
Ethan (44:35): 
Yeah. That's interesting. 
Taiwo (44:38): 
Yeah, it is. 
Ethan (44:42): 
Yeah. Well, maybe because they didn't, they don't have that experience. 
Taiwo (44:47): 
Yeah. I think it's just, they've not lost everything before, you know, and when you, when you have, it's 
easier to be like, okay, I don't want to lose everything. You know, I don't want to cross these lines that are 
going to cost me a lot. Versus somebody who's never had those consequences before. And they're like, 
oh, I can just do what I want, you know. 
Ethan (45:09): 
Wow. Okay. I didn't realize that. That's good to know. Any other issues or challenges or things you'd like 
to see improved for peer support specialists? 
Taiwo (45:23): 
No. I mean, I'd like to see more consistency with the training. You know, cause it's, at this point, it's not 
very hard to get it, and it's not supposed to be hard or anything. It's just that, you know, this is a 
respectable field, and we'd like to keep it that way. 
Ethan (45:47): 
Yeah. Yeah. And what about, since you brought up that the issue with therapists, the peer support 
specialist working with other professionals, has that ever been, is there, are there challenges there? I 
know, I know here in this specific, in this particular center, you all have the peer support specialists. 
Taiwo (46:14): 
Yeah. It's a lot easier being here because we're all on the same level when it comes to education. But it 
definitely is kind of hard, especially when you're trying to do like a wrap-around program with somebody 
with patients, and maybe peer support isn't respected as much. And it's just kind of seen as-- 
Ethan (46:40): 
By the therapists. 
Taiwo (46:42): 
Yeah. 
Ethan (46:43): 
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Well, kind of, we're kind of nearing the end, so I thought maybe sort of two other 
questions we could talk about is, you know, in this process of preparing to be a peer support specialist, 
and you're looking forward to, you know, moving into a different role in the future. You know, what are 
17 
 
some training experiences that were really crucial for you or some research that you were exposed to that 
really opened your eyes? That's maybe one question. I don't know if you have answer to that. 
Taiwo (47:26): 
You know, I was really exposed to the ACE. Have you ever heard of that, adverse childhood experience? 
And just the ramifications of high ACE scores and what it does to people's lives. And I've kind of brought 
that in here, and like we now add that as part of our curricula and part of like what our participants and 
what they fill out for us, so we can see what we're looking with them. Because it gives us a whole different 
view, versus just pen to paper, what they're going to tell us. And that has definitely changed my viewpoint. 
And I think that's why I want to be a CADC and then maybe someday get my licensure as a social worker 
or something. 
Ethan (48:27): 
Yeah. That, that's really, that's really good. So do you teach about that a little bit? 
Taiwo (48:34): 
Yes, you know, we're actually looking for grants to back us to do ACE scores for people. Cause they're 
always looking for data for that. So that's going to help us with our sustainability. 
Ethan (48:50): 
Yeah, that's awesome. And then the other question is sort of how do you, and this is probably, this is 
related to this discussion. How do you, how has your sort of idea of recovery changed over these years? 
Taiwo (49:15): 
I'm a lot more hands-on with my recovery. You know, before it was like, okay, you just don't use. And you 
just figure out a way not to use, and you white knuckle it. Or you work some steps, and you're all better, 
you know. But now I'm like, no, it's a hands-on every single day. How can I better myself? How can I do 
something that's going to go towards a goal that I want, you know. I have a list of goals that are short-
term, intermediate, and long-term, and I always every week go over them. And I'm like, okay, are we 
changing anything? Did we meet any of them? What are we doing? Because if you don't work towards 
any goals, you're really just kind of out there. And if you're just swaying in the wind, you can sway some 
way you're not, you're not supposed to, you know. So it's just, that's kind of what I've figured out is you 
have to be hands-on, and you have to be bettering yourself every single day. Even if, if you're just staying 
the same, it's okay. But at some point you, you gotta work on yourself. Cause if you're not, you're  going 
to go backward. 
Ethan (50:36): 
Right. Okay. Anything else you'd like to add? We have to mention that you're graduating from drug court 
today. And how do you feel about that? 
Taiwo (50:46): 
I feel ecstatic. I'm ready for the next step. 
Ethan (50:52): 
And so what are some goals--you, you mentioned goals, and one of your goals is to-- 
18 
 
Taiwo (50:57): 
Yeah. It was to graduate from drug court, get my TCADC, lose weight, because I've gained a lot of weight 
in recovery. Which is, it's a trend. I've seen a lot of people gain a lot of weight in recovery. And I, I want to 
go the other way now, healthily. And I want to become financially very independent. So those are my, 
those are my bigger goals. 
Ethan (51:28): 
Yeah. I'm sure you will, I'm sure you will get there, to all those goals, very quickly, with the progress that 
you've made this year, right? Just this year. Thank you so much. And I think we can stop it there unless 
there's anything else that you want to add. 
Taiwo (51:46): 
No.
