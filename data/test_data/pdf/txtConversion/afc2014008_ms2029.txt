LIBRARY OF CONGRESS SPEECH
 
Since I work--and have worked for some time now--at a
 
federal agency known as the National Endowment for th
Arts,  it
 
appears to me that I should attempt to address cultural
 
conservation--the issue cot Th n in- this conference--in terms of
 
art.
 Now,  to handle "culture"  and "conservation"  and "art"  in a
 
ten minute time limit is simply asking for trouble.
 However,  I
 
am getting on nowadays,  and trouble seems maybe a bit  less
 
troublesome to me than it used to.
 (Somebody else,  after all,
 
will have to clean up the mess  I leave behind.
 
So holding my breath and taking a firm grip on the podium
 
here,  I now pronounce that for me art has to do with the
 
schematic rendering in a myriad complex ways of the ethical and
 
value standards of a particular group -
-
 their goods,  their
 
bads,  their complex in-betweens.
 Thus artists--whether
 
commercial,  traditional,  avant garde,  idealistic, Veci'S
 9)
 
conservative--are essentially concerned with making public the
 
values of a particular group of people.
 These values may be
 
presented negatively or positively,  through content or style,  in
 
a myriad of permutations,  but the point I centrally wish to make
 
is that art--like play--is essentially a serious matter.
 
Neither art nor play should ever be taken lightly,  partly
 
because they have been placed in a realm of
 
or
 
- 2 -
irresponsibility--"that's just a game," or "that's only a sketch
 
of it," or "all artists are c
razy
 
I once spent a long time considering the importance of the
 
unimportant and--since I was particularly concentrating on both
 
folklore and on game, both notably unimportant--I became
 
convinced,  along with Gregory Bateson and others,  that societies
 
deliberately put a few elements into a special domain where
 
their immediate outcome,  their immediate results,  literally
 
don't matter.
 In games,  the rules tell you so;  it doesn't  —

 In art,  it is

implicit that the viewer can like a portrait or not like it,
 
or
 
understand it or find it incomprehensibleA
 and nothing
 
societally drastic will happen either way.
 A picture isn't,
 
after all,  real.
 
But all societies that we know of include both play and
 
art--these unproductive,  trivial,  inconsequential un-real
 
activities--in their basic cultural repertoires.
 Now,  societies
 
don't generally do things that aren't useful
 in
 
some way or other.

experiment may flourish.
 If it isn't important,  a number of
 
possibilities can be explored and mapped out.
 If it isn't
 
-
 
important, the spirit can soar to uninvestigated heights--or
 
depths.
 The important thing is that it doesn't matter. 
If it
 
mattered,  the budgetary limits of the grant, or the political
 
appropriateness of the topic, or the stupidity or the venality
 
or the glory of the total concept could affect the outcome in
 
many drastic ways.

f something isn't important,  a certain freedom to
 
So.
 In the battle between conflicting values within a
 
complex society such as ours,  the arts--those trivial and above
 
all unimportant decorations--may indeed play vital roles.
 They
 
elaborate and specify.
 They highlight and parallel.
 They evoke
 
and converge.
 They discourage and rally.
 They outrage and
 
mollify.
 Hopefully,  they make matters a bit clearer.
 They are
 
of especial importance because they are linked, not to a group's
 
specific way of handling a problem (a particular judicial code,
 
for example) but to its overall concept of justice.
 Thus,  they
 
are especially suitable for transference into new social mileaux.

in meeting reports.
 Perhaps what I have just said is mothers'
 
milk to you all, but I have tried to dig out just why-1 have
 
always thought the arts of folk groups were of especial
 
importance and why I have on the whole found myself happy during
 
the past years working at the National Endowment for the Arts. 
For you see if even a part of what I have just said is true,
 
then we have--as a largef greatly encompassing society--a

 We must consider how to protect

all,  the aesthetic statements that each of our smaller
 
constituent groups have developed.
 Their particular
 
solutions--as expressed in weaving,  song, pottery, dance,  tale,
 
carving, or music--may have especially acute fitments that
 
breathe energy into their own
 This is the kind of
 
activity that we have tried,  in the Folk Arts Program at the
 
National Endowment for the Arts,  to support and further.
 It was
 
a limited goal, but it seems to have been effective.
 I hope the
 
Congress will help us continue.
