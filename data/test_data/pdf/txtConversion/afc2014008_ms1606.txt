.
 
however,  it takes three or four centuries sometimes to get a new
 
f view established.
 Students often say "I agree with that" or "I di

:wo other characteristics:
 
I)
 It is the only intellectual outlook that attempts to embr c

 physically and socially -

 or man and his .,
 
ome of our best biologists not only do not take culture into account
 
ut they are totally incapable of grasping the concept of culture at
 
he behavior of human beings is not determined by biological factors
 
Al but by culture.  For example, as human beings we have marriage
 
posed to mating; within the institution of marriage there are five"
 
or:ns:
  
a)  Group marriage (which never

n1v been postulated es

c)  Poly an dr:
 
) Polygamy
 
a)  Celibacy (which  is  that i
'or: of :
iarriage in
 
souscs is zero -
-
 White's definition.1  The term "celibac
 
i
eaning apart from the concept of marriage.)
 
hen what determines the institution of marriage is the cultu'
 't
 
ot the physiological necessity of mating.
 Biologists can't underste:
 
that because their gophers and crocodiles don t act that way.
 Social
 
:ciences are specialized.  None of them attempt to grasp man as a who

xcept anthropology which isn't doing the job very well probably.

he point of view in itself is important: that you visualize behavi'

wo ways: on the one hand by the acquisition of new facts, secondly
 
formulation of new theories by means of which the facts already
 
ave been explained."  All of the major discoveries of recent times hav
 
ome into this latter category -

 White said this -

 ? The Ori'

ecies was a synthesis, not just a compendium of facts, all of which wcun
 
tready known.
 It was not so much novel as timely; western thought was
 
eady to have this system organized for it.  Revolution is a change whi
 
cannot be
 described in quantitative terms -

 evolution can be.

The subject matter of psychologists and culturologists is e

the things and events they study are exactly the same.
 Students of words
 
belong to two classes: psychologists and linguists.  Walter E Pillsbury (
 
edited The ?sycholocy of Speech; his chapter headings included such
 
as "Attitudes" EEmotions" etc.  He wanted to find out how does it feet
 
to talk.
 Lan,

"
Syntax",  "Lexicon " etc.  He is considering words in relationshii  to
 
words.
 This is what culturology is, and this is the distinction bet7

psychology and cuitorology.

Suggested that anthropology must call on associated disciplines such a s
 
geography and climatology; in general, anthropological proofs can be strenr
--
 
thened by additional evidences of th ese  adj acen
t fields.
 e
.g. a type of
 
nottery turned up in South American very similar to a kind known in J a n i n.
 
Carbon dating suggested that this settlement had been actually made from
 
Japan.
 Knowledge that t
iq at that time the sea level was 10 feet higher
 
would have strengthened the point; the particular bay area was a logical
 
settlement during that era; it would not have been so later.
 
He sees the world as a large land mass comprising Europe-Asia-Africa with
 
a
rmendages into Australia and North-South America.
 
Australia was cut off from the rest of the world; no primates reached
 
there.
 It took no part in the development of man who settled it very late.
 
There is no evidence of man in Australia before homo sapiens.
 
Madagascar is also cut off.
 Only the lowest form of primate life -
 the
 
lemur -
 got there; we at3 have no evidence of any form of man reaching there
 
except for homo sapiens.
 Giant birds -
 the almost legendary rocs -
 survived
 
there almost to modern times.
 
Our study of the earliest types of man is confined almost exclusively to
 
Europe-Africa-Asia.
 
North and South America had monkeys but there is no evidence that any
 
nrimates except homo sapiens was able to get across the three bridges
 
(Bering Straits to Alaska; central America to South America; island chain
 
to Australia).  Man had to develop the ability to navigate before he could
 
make these big jumps. Villafrancian creatures (horse, cow,  elephant) at the
 
beginning the ice age were in North America and found their way into Asia
 
crossing the Bering Strait bridge the wrong way.
 We don't know how but "
a
 
door was opened" and in some fashion this migration was possible.
 (The
 
Pleistocene or Ice Age begins with the appearance of 9 Villefrancian f a u n a
 
in Asia/Europe; this does not apply to Madagascar because they didn't get
 
there until
 man took them, nor to America becau se  th ey were
 alrea
dy there.
 
Apparently this is a relative term?)
 
At the beginning of the Ice Age there were man types on both sides of the
 
Equator from Africa through Asia; they stayed right around there and didn't
 
go across the bridge to North America; it was all one-way traffic during
 
this period (animals coming east).  Man is basically a creature of the
 
velt (
?) - -
 the area north and south of the equator.  Within this belt l
ie
 
had freedom of movement.  There is no reason to assume that African fossils
 
re more ancient than others; but there do seem to be certain kinds of cul-
ural differences since there were some barriers which tended to slow down
 
aontact between Europe and Asia.
 The Ice Age lasted for (
?) 7
t to 3 million
 
years; estimates are being constantly revised upwards.
 
As anthropologists we have to see the world in terms of geography and climate.
 
an is a child of the tropics.
 The whole of the northern world was cut off
 
to man until very late; no fossils before Homo Spaiens have ever been found
 
in the north temperate zone.
 Even the diseases of man are those common to
 
the tronjcr
!l z
o
n
e
.
 
In the consideration of climate; water a n d
 rainfall are of irnortance and
 
these vary.
 During the ice
 age the ice cap in places was 2 so thick
 
that it absorbed so much water that should have been in the ocean that the
 
ocean level dropped 100 meters in some areas.
 
The actual topography or shane of the land is of imno tance ir considerina
 
migrations.
 There is a somewhat hori ontql band of mountains across Euro e
 
(about 10 million)
 
and Asia that inhibited north-south movement of peoples.
 During the ice
 
age he had to navigate along the coast or take island hops of 10.  20 or 30
 
miles.  At the end of the ice age there were relatively few people on
 
earth and every one of them was a b hunter.
 Only during the past 10000
 
years have other ways of life been possible. All the artic was uninhabited
 
by man; he had not reached Madagascar nor the mountains of New Guinea;
 
he had reached Australia but not into South America exce t along the western
 
coast.
 
About 1500 A
.D. the pattern was quite different.
 Agriculture had saread
 
to eight tenths of the world; hunters numbered only 1
2.
 The world nonulation
 
had increased 35 fold to 350 million.
 
Now the hunters are gone; and the world population is three billion.
 
(A few remarks about gardening; from the same subtro ical belt about 10.000
 
years ago, ymm native plants were domesticated and transported to other
 
sections of the world.
 If you start with Australia and move north, you find
 
s
imple hunters, moving north over the island chain you get first simple
 
.
ardening techiniques such as s
lash and burn and more elaborate ones mur
 
the more northerly you go.)

Effect of climatic change has been to produce movement of people
 
one
 
part of the earth to another; this is still true in modern ti mes -
-
 viz
 
drouth in China and Oklahoma.
 Population movements in Africa tend to be
 
away from the continent center and into the peninsulas; the same movement
 
pattern can be traced in a general way throughout the earth's surface.
 
In Australia, considering the routes by which they must have come (basically
 
three) the remotest areas xmdx
:tke are the east coast and Tasmania.
 The
 
three routes are the only ways in which man could have come; all landed on
 
the northern coast except the Europeans who changed the whole  attern of
 
the world's history by developing boats and navigation.
 
(Africa has always been an appenda e -
 oeninsula to Asi
'nd  ero-'e -

 History of the

land mass was commonly held.  ?
)
 
In 1870. Wallace first pointed out that there was a deep water channel
 
from Bali through the Celebes; t
x ø uxtø really Borneo  Sumatra and
 
Java were really parts of the mainland until the end of the ice age.
 
During the ice age great masses of water were frozen and stacked up on the
 
land; during the cold phas s of the ice age  the line Wallace niotted was
 
the edge of the Asian continent (see map in Tindall's book).
 
This has had a profound effect on Australia, which is surrounded by shallow 
water.  Down off the southern coast is Kangaroo Island separated by a shallow
 
water channel; during the ice age it was part of the land mass.
 
Today the climate of Australia includes a large area of arid land deficient
 
in rainfall both summer and winter.  There is a wet strip right round the
 
coast.
 If you think in terms of how people came in,  the people coming from
 
he north would move around the coast towards the south, circling the desert.
 
it  climate is never static; it is always changing.
 The modern whites of
 
\
ustralia are agriculturalists immediately affected and directly dependent
 
on rainfall.  The effects of drouth on food supply are immediate; they set
 
neople in motion immediately.
 In modern times drouth equals a drop in
 
the production of wheat;even though it is compensated for by the extra nro-
ductivity of the rested land the following year, the overall drop returns.
 
The effects on sheep and cattle are less drastic although bad enough.
 For
 
oeople who depend on animals either by
 hunting or herding.  the effects are
 
buffered at first, but eventually they, like the agriculturalists, have
 
to leave.
 
t
he long range climatic change in Australia is towards general drouth (
?)

This terrace shows the percent of fresh water loving micro-mollusca; the
 
neak of their appearance is in the ten foot terrace point; going downwards
 
the percentage of brackish water micro-mollusca increases and the first de-
crease.

lide of a volcano in Australia; erun ted (grew un) during a very
 
fertile rex

710 M B.P.;  the ash contains leaves and

terrace.
 
Griffith Taylor, an astute professbr of geography at Chicago has pointed
 
out that there is always a belt of aridity interpolated t bw between a
 
tropical region and a temperate zone.  This is true of Africa, parentheti-
cally; there has never been a t
ime when al
l of Africa was wet and then a
ll
 
dry; the same thing applies to North American and Australia.
 
In Australia the belt of aridity was at one time farther north than at
 
present.  This belt sealed off bottom of the Australia from the cool tem-
perate zone of the south.
 (
?)  A mountain belt running along the w east
 
coast produced more rain on the mountain s
lopes,  thus became the road
 
to Australia.
 Invading nonulations from the north went around the east
 
coast towards the south.
 
The belt of aridity has moved south s
ince the receding of the g
lacier
 
(
query BH which way did the glacier recede?)  The central region always
 
gets its coming and going, no matter where the belt of aridity is....
 
Australia has always had an east-west barrier sometimes extending in the
 
northerly region and sometimes more to the south; the move of neo'les h
as
 
always been along the seacoast.  Now they have moved inland.
 
The most difficult environments are the rain forests (
?) The l
ess s
uccess-
ful move into the rain forests.  The southwestern parts of Australia is
 
the remotests part; this plus Tasmania.  The first people to come into
 
Australia were peoples who moved into difficult rain forests in southwest
 
Australia; they took refuge there (
the Barrinean Negritos).  The later
 
1
urrayian people's mythology states that they fought with Pyg y types
 
when they first came to Australia.
 The C
ar'
-
. enterian are t
he third ty e
 
of people to come in.
 
During the ice age the iurrayian occupied the large bottom half of Australia.
 
After the ice age,  they were pushed south and around the southwest coast.
 
The movements of the third group (Carpenterians) were aided and abetted by
 
climatic change.  Sunda land =  mainland Asia (a part)  Borneo, Java and
 
Sumatra, Australia and New Guinea and Tasmania were all together.
 But in
 
the belt between Sunda land and Australia there was virtually no change;
 
lots of small islands with deep
. water channels,  so even at the c
lose of the
 
ice age no major change occurred there.
 
There are marsupials in Australia; modern mammals in Sunda Land; this l
eads
 
to the conclusion that these two areas have always been separate.  The
 
water barrier between the two has never been bridge by land,  so thati none
 
of the walking mammals could get across.  One or two species of mice have
 
been able to bridge the gap, possibly on floating logs.
 But t really there
 
is a complete schism b in this gulf between Sundaland and Australia, result-
ing in modern mammals on the one side and marsupials on the other.
 Even
 
during the ice age the minimum water gan that had to be traversed was ten
 
miles; therefore navigation was a necessity.  And the populations of Aus-
tralia had to await the development of some  kind of navigation to be able
 
to cross.
 
There is evidence that man xxu came to Australia through 3 different routes
 
(
judging by the similarity of peonies in other areas.
 
In the Cave of Niah in northwest Borneo where there are some of the 1ar est
 
caves in the world (dry ones) 42000 years ago a child 12-14 years old dieh
 
and was buried with his head under a stone.
 This boy has had a tremendoi'
 
influence on the thinking of modern man.
 He was homo sapiens at a time
 
when much of Europe wasinhabited by Neanderthal which was al o t e
'ti'c
 
because it was being destroyed by invaders from the east.  (
!)
 
This discovery was probably one of the most important discoveriest ci
 
modern times.  At the time this youth died he was living on a piece o
 
land on the mainland which extended right across  urope and Africa.
 
His cranium was compared with other skulls; it was closest to Tasmania
 
youth.
 The Wodjak skull (Java) was related to it; the Niah cave child
 
belonged to a family noised at the doorway to Australia 42000 years agc.
 
In the Niah cave there were large fist axes which were in use at the time
 
this boy was buried and stxtuas which lasted until 32000 B
.P.  At that time
 
they disappeared.
 
The evidence shows that the Niah cave skull was an Negrito; we find Ne-
gritos in the rain ry forests of Malaya, in the mountains of the Phillippines,
 
in the mountains of New Guinea and the Andaman Islands.
 
The minimum requisite for Negritos to come to Australia was some kind of
 
vehicle for crossing water.
 Rafts of logs pegged together ± are still
 
in use in Australia so that it is evident that the people of Australian
 
coastal areas still use and remember this most ancient water vehicle.
 
Ernest Jones said:
 
Man came to Australia with his wife on a raft with his dog
 
dog's wife.
 
However, in Australia, the first people who came to Australia d1
 '
n
 
dogs; in Tasmania therefore there are no dogs.
 Ne2ritos came on  i  r t
 
with women.
 (Domestication of the dog came later.)
 
The Tasmanian natives were all killed off by Eurooe ns who  crdei ther to-
gether and coughed at them.
 They had fuzzy hair (not peppercorn like
 
Bushman/Pygmy) they were short in stature with  a long uoper lip and a dis-
tinctive flat but shaped nose.
 There are still such peoples in the rain
 
forests of north-eastern Australia.
 The males average five feet; the wo
 
shorter.  A newborn Negrito baby is white in  i
r:ment tion w

hair; the change occurs slowly after birth.
 
The past history of the Negritos is difficult to reconstruct because at
 
death Negritos dessicate the body, cut out flesh and mummify it and then
 
keep it for a while to generally burn it at last.
 In other areas  Negritos
 
often carry around a portion of the dead person as a memento.
 This means
 
it is very idfficult to find Negrito cemeteries of any size.
 
When the seas rose and cut off Tasmania. Negritos were the only neonle
 
living there, though later the Murrayians moved in and hybridized a bit.
 
roday the Barrinean peoples are found in the north-eastern corner (
and
 
the south-western corner today?)

 Semang Negritos of Malaya.
 They had Hoabhinian stone
 
tools, first sporadically and then more and more frequently edge groudd
 
tools appear and then pottery and finally metal. It is evident the Negrito
 
peoples have been in contact with rat
owtn other peoples for a very long time
 
specifically the agriculturalists of the coastal area.
 This situation in
 
i
:alaya is very similar to the way of life of the Australian negrito. Further
 
the peg raft persists (first made of bamboo and then of light woods); even
 
the hunting call is the same as that heard and described by the early ex-
plorers of Australia.
 
All through Malaya there are Senanc  (
Semang?) 'eonles,  but also the Sakai
 
with low to medium waved hair.
 
Samboo apparently evolved in
 i
alaya and immigrated into Australia in
 
only a few olaces.  Where it does occur and wherever, it has a strong effect
 
on man, because it is so useful.
 Today we find peoples who show that they
 
once had bamboo because of certain features of their technology; perhaps
 
they once lived in areas where bamboo grew from which they migrated.
 
a
.ny artifacts show historical origin; the shape of the s000n with the l
ittle
 
nrojecting wings where the bowl joins the handle is reflective of the fict
 
that the spoon was once a sDorldylus shell.
 
Peoples began to move out towards the Pacific durinc

A second group of white aboriginal peoples (very distantly related oeople
 
of somewhat similar type to the hairy Ainu and the t t rx  X
E 1  European
 
stock)  :
 Murrayiaris. 
They were first described by the English buccaneer
 
Dampier wkio after whom Dampierland was named; he said they were the "most
 
miserablest" peoples on earth.
 (According to Greenway, Dampier described
 
the Bard peoples; Darnpierland is northwest Australia.
 Dampier's descrintion
 
of the Bards was so critical that when Jonathan Swift read it some years
 
later he based his description of the Yahoos on Dampier's writing.)
 
urrayians grow grey and turn bald; the Ainu of Japan are their closest
 
i tg1 àx relatives.
 They were originally aborigines of eastern Aisian coast
 
and wandered along the coast apparently at one time reaching down into
 
Australia.  The Ainu only different significantly from Murrayians in their
 
skin color which is lighter. The Ainu were replaced by the Mongolian neoples
 
about 2000 years ago but are still living in the northern Japanese islands;
 
they were the original inhabitants of Japan. The  urrayian skin color
 
anpears to be the result of intense sunburn.
 
We have fossils 12000 years old of the Murrayian type in Australia.
 Sakai
 
Cohuna and Kaeilor (so?) in southern Australia are the fossil sites for
 
these discoveries.
 They are similar to the Wodjak type of Java (
?)
 
in other words, there is nxtdf
fxzn fossil evidence that peoples of the  urray-
ian type were living during the late Pleistocene in Java. northern Japan
 
and possibly related to some peoples in India.
 
The third type is the Carpenterians with non-hairy bodies, dark skina,
 
aain simply deep sunburn rather than black.

'urrayians and Carnenterians
 
have mixed in some places.
 
In the southwestern area a mutation has a

'peared for blond h
air and it is
 
spreading out from a point in the western desert in the center of which all
 
the children are blond.
 
the Carpenterians (of the north)differ from the Murrayians (of the south):
 
in that they have low to medium wavy hair, rather depressed nose, smooth
 
brown skin, entire absence of body hair; they are very similar to the Sakai 
people of the Malayan jungles.
 The Vedda are an aboriginal people ad Ceylon.
 
'

e know very l
ittle about them, but they are said to be s
imilar to the Car-
tenter anS.
 
The picture then is that Australia has been occu ied by three successive
 
waves of peoples, all hunting peonies. all living in much the same style.
 
The western desert tribes appear to be mixed Murrayian3 and Carpenterian
 
peoples (Greenway says there must be some Negrito).  isolated and subjected
 
to mutation, according to Birdsell.
 They are in the nrocess of becoming a
 
different people.
 
The island of New Guinea today is inhabited by neo le who are dark-skinned
 
and who are to some extent agriculturalists; this differs from the Australians.
 
A cave called "Kiowa" 6000 feet in the highlands of New Guinea has yielded
 
some archaeological evidence.
 Some people arrived there about 10,000 years
 
ago. at the time of the end of the Ice Age.
 They must have moved up from
 
the lowlands; we don't know why really, but l
oorkars they moved up when the
 
weather a
rnelior ted, making life possible for them at 6000 feet. About 6000
 
years ago.  these peo le began simple ariculture; before then they had been
 
hunters.
 
New Guinea is a very mountainous land with much rainfall.
 The Fly river
 
delta suddenly mounts into an extremely steep range of mountains with needle
 
sharp points to the north, then a high plateau singking slowly to the sea.
 
It is covered with heavy rainforests; still living in those forests are Nenrito
 
types such as the Ra Tapero pygmies.

Throughout southwest Asia there are composite or hybrid peoples, mixtures of
 
the three groups: N
, M, C
.  Probably all three groups moved into Australia
 
before the end of the Ice Age.
 
Timor is inhabited my mountain '
,eo'les who are substantially Negritos -

 they
 
are called Papuans (Papua is the old name for New Guinea); Negritos mixed
 
with Carpenterians.
 
A fourth group -

 proto-Malayans (
Polynesians  Indonesians) have l
ight skin
 
and no Mongolian fold -
-
 similar to the Balinese in appearance.
 Dutero or
 
the second wave of Malays tend to have the Mongolian fold.
 
when proto-Malays move in, the older people move into the mountains and abandon
 
the seacoast to the invaders who invariably come in from the sea.
 Sometimes
 
the invading peoples will establish settlements on small x islands offshore
 
and come to some kind of terms with the shore people.
 
4e1anesia in effect means people of the older stock who have mixed with Poly-
nesians.
 In the Solomons and the Trobriands the fundamental stock was Negrito
 
mixed with Polynesians.
 They are a special hybrid type, following mostly
 
Polynesian culture patterns especially in their language. New Ireland shows
 
Carpenterian,  Barrinean Negrito mix with the oroto-Malays coming in last.
 
In each separate Melanesian area, there tends to be a different kind of mi
 
dependin  on the size of the native 'o' ulation and the number of intruding
 
'
ialayans.
 The invaders almost always are dominant especially as far as lan-
uage goes.

their invasion of the Pacific is quite old -

t
he Australian tribe i
s an evaimle of the kind of organization that i
s
 
possible among humtning peoples.
 There are some700 aboriginal tribes
 
An Australian tribe is a loosely organized group of people who share a
 
territory and who regard themselves as members of one  ,
roun; "well as
 
against "they".
 
The territory of a tribe always has a most favored location within it where
 
they can take ultimate refuge during the critical days of the season when
 
food and/or water is scarce.
 During good times.  when "
anywhere is a cama"
 
the people go out into the less favored areas.
 
The people who share a territory have a common language; since they return
 
together periodically the language is always re-vrganized ind refreshed
 
so that it is kept common to the group; incipient differences in local
 
dialects are ironed out by this continual nrocess of return to the center.
 
If a terson dies, his totem word is eleiminated because to say e
.g.  "kan-
garoo" would recall his s
iirit; during this time of danger the term is
 
eliminated and a word may be borrwed from a neighboring tribe or an older
 
word may be resurrected; however this is only a temporary situation.
 
A tribe consists of a group of people who live together at least part of
 
a year but which must break up from time to time in order to exploit less
 
favored areas within the territory.
 The average size is about 400-500
 
members -
-
 about the largest group that can  i call themselves a "we"
 
without a complex formal organization.
 The Kamilarot (NSW) was 2000 at
 
one point; (211 on map) the Karadelt on Betinck Island in the Gulf of
 
Carpentaria (can't find on the map -
 the people, that is) consisted of
 
123 reduced to 63 by natural calamity and inter-tribe rivalries (
?)
 
These then are two extremes from unusually large to i
amumtt unusually small;
 
the average is 4-500.
 
A subterritory exploited by a subgroup is a hordal territory.
 A tribe con-
sists of from one to 20 hordes; the usual size of a horde is 30-40.
 Each
 
horde, during the easy part of a year exploits the remote parts of the
 
territory.
 Any people can only walk so far during a year; there is,  there-
fore a natural limit placed on the distance a group can move.  During the
 
good times they move less because their needs can be satisfied close by.
 
In areas of great rainfall the territory covered would be less; the size
 
of the territories then varies with the amount of rainfall.
 
originally (
?)
 
By this kind of figuring, we can estimate that there were tx1x1kWxf
tmwxuf
 
t
t
 (or are ?
) about 300.000 Australian aborigines.
 At the end of the
 
Ice Age,  10,000 years ago, all the oeo',le in the world were hunters  and
 
there were only about 10 million of them; therefore Australia was fairly
 
densely populated.

A tribal territory fits in together with the territories of other tribes;
 
each tribe tends then to be in contact with (and hold their territory
 
against) about six other tribes.
 They tend to fit together into a kind
 
of honeycomb shape, because of the efficient of covering territory with
 
eople who must walk out from a central place; this always is affected
 
by geography -
-
 a mountain range might bar a tribe from contact with
 
its neighbor on the other side.
 Relations with adjacent tribes vary -
-
some are friendly, others hostile.
 If a tribe gets into
 g trouble they
 
may flee in some favored direction.
 No one territory is fully equipped tk
 
to provide everything that one wants; trade and commerce are then essential
 
if there are no aoods to exchance for what you want.  there are always cirls
 
An average of i5  of marriages are inter-tribal; trade results in trans-
gressions of the tribal boundaries.

The central time when tribes come together is often apt to be a good t
ime
 
of year because as the rains come,  the animals scatter and are hard to
 
find.
 As the dry season wears on  the animals have to congregate near a
 
water hole.
 Euring this time the men have time to engage in ceremonials.
 
they come together; the young men who are less comtetent hunters can stand
 
by a water hole and spear game; the old men work un the ceremonies ine
 
the women are sent off to look for roots.
 
The social organization of a tribe; it is made un of hordes which are  rou"s
 
of people who are related along the natrilineal line (mostly -
 always?)
 
The t
,atrilineal line is called a clan; all Australians marry outside their
 
own clan.  A horde equals the clan plus imported women and minus the girls
 
who are exported.
 Therefore a horde is a kind of extended family.
 
1
ithin each generation the same term is used (
father for father and father's
 
brother,  for example.)
 
No group reduced to too small a size can successfully survive; therefore
 
the nuclear family per se will not be so terribly important; the extended
 
family (horde) is the more a

cessful hunter may have several wives and
 therefore
 
his own nuclear family may be large enough to comprise a horde.
 Even
 
within an extended family,  a person may have his own individual huntino

 this is usually nuclear family territory however.

In  till 1907 a rancher could get a permit to destroy up to a dozen 'ver in"

;e know very little about how women are br ght into society; apnarently
 
the process is largely mother to daughter information.
 One of the thin-s
 
that is done in the area of general education is a little skit with
 
about forty or fifty songs w
'iich shows what happens when a woman tried
 
to live alone.
 It shows women doing all the indiscreet and foolish thin-s
 
that a big man would never do; these all end in disaster (going out to
 
hunt without taking water first, making a boo eran  oit of the wron
 
wood so that it warps, etc.)
 
in the education of the men ,
 all the beliefs, rites and ceremonials cen-
ter around wa ter and animal and plant food; especially animal, since
 
animal life is mobile and must be sought out.
 The other two stay stilt

'
nder the control of men are certain attempts at conservation.
 Cne of
 
the indications of the presence of water is the present of the carpet
 
snake which always lives near water and cannot survive far away.  Any
 
attempt to kill the carpet snake would destroy the water, for they
 
helieve that the snake protects it.
 The are above the water supply
 
i
s sacred to the snake; it is its home.
 Interestingly, if man lived in
 
the area above the water hole, they would undoubtedly contaminate the
 
water; therefore this ban acts to prevent disease.
 
Z
any tribes will have the carpet snake as their totem; they will
 then
 
"e responsible for the availability of water.
 The word for sacred is
 
t
jukur. 
Your totem name is the mRa name of the animal plus the term
 
sicred.  Papa =  dog.
 Therefore Paptjukurna would be the totemic name
 
of an individual of the dog totem; this name would also be applied to
 
your grandfather, your father and your son etc. and all will be respor
i-
s
i
.hle for cereménies insuring the dogs will increase and multiply.

 August the aboriginals see the heliacal rising of the Pleiades
 
for whome the aborigenes also have a Seven Sisters myth.  The early dawn
 
rising of the Pleiades after not having been seen in the dawn sky is
 
the time of celebrating the dog ceremonies; it's apparently pupping t
ime.
 
Certain seasons of the year the kangaroo ceremonies are performed,
 
en perform the ceremony for the increase of the rock wallaby whmvanver
 
whenever they go into the area where the rock wallaby first appeared.
 
I
t seems that these ceremonies preserve a racial memory of the time when
 
an animal first had appeared or when a tribe had first come across it.
 
Animals are not distributed evenly all over Australia; therefore these
 
ceremonies also serve the function of reminding the tribe that these
 
animals are to be found in that particular area. Some times such an
 
area is marked by a special arrangement of stones with sacred objects
 
h
idden between and around them.  Two large stones =  the father and mother
 
wallaby; these ring when struck, one in a high pitch and one in a low
 
so the father and mother could talk there.  The small rocks are children
 
and possibly other relatives.
 Some anthronologists think this is an ac-
tual representation of the first horde to set un this ceremonial soot -
-
an early historical record.
 
The ceremonies increase in importance with the importance o
f the food.
 
This importance may be direct or indirect.
 For an example of the latter
 
one of the most important ceremonies is for the increase of pelicans
 
which are no good for eating themselves.
 However the pelicans are asso-
ciated with the very infrequent periods of extensive rains; they only
 
come inland when the rains are so heavy that there are many inland lakes.
 
Lots of inland water =  game =  easy l
ife; this accounts for the desir bi1ity
 
of the pelican's increase.
 
In inttiation ceremonies, the boy receives key points first; he i
s -
"
 
to see certain things that are important to him and hear (
lying facc
 
down) atkar words and songs that are important; only towards the end
 
of the initiation process does he hear and see together.
 
Men according to Australian philosophy have the power of gods and can com-
pel nature to give them food and things they desire.  The only thing that
 
can go wrong is the incorrect performance of the traditional cerembnial.
 
This is why the education of the boy is so critical; the knowledge and
 
correct performance of the rites will affect his ability to supply food
 
during his later life.
 
Ken Fry, Australian ethnologist, devised the chart given out which sets
 
out relationship terms.
 It is set out from the noint of view of a man
 
speaking; the lines across show marriages.  The
 grandparents generation
 
are considered allies; the same kind of ieop1e that ego is.
 In every
 
ceremony there are people who stand for ego and behave as he will when
 
he is older.  This alternation of generations is the earliest and oldest
 
classification scheme to be found in Australian social organization.
 
?
????? The term moiety.  There are either 2
, 4 or 8
.
 Fry calls them classes;
 
others call them sections.
 (Look this up.)
 
hen a boy is initiated, the wife's father actually performs the initia-
L
ory rite; whatever the key item, the wife's father is the i central
 
f
igure because he is giving a daughter and linking the two clans together.
 
:
go's father must also be able to reciprocate (
this is decided previously
 
by negotiation) fz xxki with a daughter either of his own, one he is going
 
to conceive or an equivalent relative from his clan.
 Records are kept
 
of these transactions on stones which are marked in two and little ticks
 
scratched in each side.  The ticks are  ±± the same in number on both
 
s
ides of the divided stone or there may be one off.  An anthropologist
 
once found a pile of 150 such stones in one s
rot -
-
 all broken with only
 
one half left -
-
 a kind of aborigine sign of the breaking off of relations.
 
T
O
 women are present at the initiations; they take an active part in ab-
sentia by being responsible for providing double food rations; in the ab-
sence of the men they are responsible for feeding themselves & the men
 
too.  The women usually hunt by setting fire to grassland and catching
 
t
he small animals that run out.  The time of the ±nt± initiation ceremony
 
i
s determined to some extent by the presence of sufficient food.  The
 
women may a
lso exert some control by stating that there isn't enough food
 
left in the area and the men will just have to speed the aff ir up.
 
art of the importance of the ceremonies is the biological knowledge (
Some

actually a geographic exposition of the country; they indicate the char-
acteristics by which the area can be recognized as favorable for food and
 
so forth.  They sum up the experiences of the older generation in hunt-
ing and finding water; the special places within his tribal area are
 
fixed in the youth's mind. He rm4 obtains a knowledge of his territory,
 
a knowledge of the times of year for hunting and when water is present
 
in which localities, which way to retreat under attack. etc.
 He becomes
 
an adult and responsible member of society.
 He has been subjected before

at a time, talking entirely with hand signs etc.  Australian aborigines
 
are extremely skillful at hand signals for communication.

(
I don't think So)
 
In the initiation ceremonies, each man has a nart to play depending on his
 
relationship to the initiate.
 Even though the actual mother's brother
 
may be dead or off somewhere, there is always another person around who
 
is also called mother's brother who is therefore able to take on the role.
 
\ man then has mm many father's father, mother's brother etc.
 
SLIDES 
In the desert a horde may occupy 1000 square miles; in fertile
 
rainy areas along the coast, the sections of land are much smaller. Old
 
men, on a trip, may often carry the small children.  After all they are
 
of the same generation and have to look after each other..
 
dhen tribes meet they try to find out about relationships; most of the tra-
gedies and fights between whites and aborigines have arisen because of
 
misunderstanding the relationship system.
 (When a settler "marries" an
 
abo woman and later wishes to take on a second wife, he may inadvertently
 
select his motherinlaw or otherwise commit incest; this is the reason for
 
much conflict.
 
The early trade routes probably went all around the coast; they exist to-
day as distinguishable paths in spots.
 
The aborigines think of the child's body as being nut into the woman by the
 
father.  The legs are put in first and so on; thus often several sex acts
 
are needed before the job is conmplete.  The spirit of the child enters
 
when the mother feels the child stir within her.
 The area where this hap-
pens determines which spirit has entered the child's body and what totem
 
he therefore belongs to.
 This is decided (which the totemic animal is)
 
by a conference of the males of the tribe or horde.
 The father may per-
form a ceremony using the buliroarer or make a model of a male child; there
 
is always a shortage of male children.
 
The dingo is linked with the idea of circumcision in certain 'arts of Aus-
tralia.
 In some myths the dingo actually bites off the foreskin.
 It is
 
nossible that the people who brought the dingo to Australia also brought
 
the idea of circumcision; it is likely that the dingo came in with the
 
Carpentarians.
 There is some archaeological evidence that there were no
 
in EoO  P but nresent by 4
.200.
 Some of the circumcision cere-
monies may thus be as nuch as 5 or 6000 years old.
 T
he dingo is es' eciii1y
 
'
-rominent in the circumcision ceremonies.  All stages of initi t
iion are
 
connected in some way with the swinging of the buliroarer.

kAL  INITI ATION
 
Initiation is the equivalent of our university and you can
 
trace the stages of all that the boy undergoes in obtaining his educa-
tionx in both cultures.
 Even the physical mutilation survives in present
 
'ay sarim  European society in the form of the hazing that you find in
 
colleaes.
 The young man is brought to focus his attention on the infer-
tion which he is to absorb and he becomes a full man.
 
We think many of the ideas in the initiation ceremony oF t
he
 
\
ustr2lian aborigine are five to 6000 years old.  The Eagle and Crow
 
yth includes mention of eruption of volcanoes which took niace 4700
 
years ago and the principal dramatic moments of the myth surround this
 
c
'ruption.
 Other evidence includes the fact that some of the younger
 
yths incor orate such events as eclinses of 3
.4. and 5000 years ago.
 
I assume that Dr. T. meant that these myths are told during the initiatory
 
rites.)
 
The place of today's film is 300 miles west of the location of
 
esterday's film (about the kangaroo and dog renewal rites).

The film was made in 1935 by an expedition which made the first
 
contact with the aborigines in the Warburton Ranges of West Australia.
 
[
ae tribe is the Nana at the occasion of a meeting with the Ngadadjara;
 
this was the first contact the two tribes had had together for fifteen
 
years.
 They had
 x r
k t
x
i  quarrelled over marriage contracts and
 
'ought at that time.
 Then the Nana had been driven into the W
t r x
 
'
arburton  Range by a water shortage.
 Both tribes had marriageable
 
tErn young men and the fathers got together and decided on the marriage
 
swaps.
 The expedition was able to take advantage of the situation; the
 
l
anguage t
±
xt xi  these two tribes spoke was similar to the Pitjandjara
 
tongue and the expedition also had competent interpreters. especially
 
Murrayian from the south, who took nart in the ceremonies and in a
 
cense represented the anthropologists in the ceremony; he seemed to be
 
enjoying himself.
 
'
ost initiation ceremonies take place at night but luckily in the n c  re-
past some difficulties had arisen because of light problems (one
 
-ember had bled to death because the operator couldn't see) so these
 
-eop1e did their ceremonies at noon.  This They have a somewhat similqr
 
organization to Pitjandjara.  the difference being that the alternate
 
enerations are named, instead of r being called "our side" and the "other
 
z
ide".  They tell the r
nuth of the eagle and the crow (the eagle being white
 
hecause the baby eaglet is born with white fuzz) and the crow meaning
 
lack (people).  The names of the two laternate generations are therefore:
 
the people who sit in the sun and the
 
-eople who sit in the shade.
 They act as two alternate teams throughout
 
the ceremonies.
 
rhe people of yesterday's film were the Pitjandjsra of Konanandi in
 
the Western Musgrove Ranges.
 
The father-in-law performs the operation; the man who becomes the boy's
 
"best friend" sits on him and eats the cut off parts.
 The latter person
 
becomes sacfed to the boy, acts as his guardian and never talks to him
 
again except under these ritual circumstances; he is always x mother's
 
brother's son and must be older than the initiate.
 In future he will
 
act as arbiter and help the initiate make decisions, even sending him
 
spears and such if he is in need; but all communication must be carried
 
on through an intermediary.
 In the southern tribes circumcision is not
 
racticed but the same relationship is taken by the relation who takes
 
care of the infant's dried umbilical cord.
 
T
he stone knives used in t circumcision is very like the Clovis points
 
from southwestern America.
 They are traded from stone quarry areas in
 
Northwestern Australia but are used in the western deserts.
 By being
 
traded for over 2000 miles or more, they have accuired significance and
 
therefore have the import of a ceremonial knife.
 
Various aspects of the rites ingimix as shown in slides
 
Throwing the boy up into the air; a group of men seize the boy
 
and throw him a long way up into the air; they don't have to catch him
 
and he is sometimes injured.  This is one of the ways in which a tribal
 
member can indicate disapproval of the candidate.
 
Cicatrices.
 In many parts of Australia the initiation merely
 
consists of cutting cicatrices on chest, back and possibly hips; these
 
are treated with various substances rubbed in so that a bar of proud flesh
 
develops
 
The principal areas in which circumcision is Practiced is wouth
 
west coast, western desert and it the custom is snreading north into Am -
hem land.
 The idea of subincision has developed in central western desert
 
country and is spreading out from the center.
 In the area around Adelaide
 
in the southern zi* coast the notion is receiving great resistance, and
 
othcrn natives fear going north of Adelaide for fear of "the terrible rite"
 
T
he betrothed girl has a pubic tassel tied around her neck and
 
m
nd ornament from the boy's father is worn around her neck also.  Atxtkf
f
 
At the beginning of the initiation the boy is seized and carried
 
to the xx men's camp and is made to lie down face down on the ground while
 
r various ceremonies take place.  Arm blood (drawn from the veins of the
 
older men -
-
 this is more sacred and secret than blood drawn from the geni-
tnls) is droppied over the initiates back from the old men's blood.
 
The older men then run backward makind a"road"to the place where
 
the operation will be done; each one runs backward with their legs wide
 
apart going very swiftly scuffing up the ground as they slide their feet
 
backward.
 Holes are quickly scooped in the sand at the end of the road
 
and the table for the operation is formed by the backs of kneeling men
 
(about four of them) on which the x boy is lain.
 One group (
Sun or shade)
 
operates; while the other stands in the distance and watches.
 
The knife is a projectile point; each man who is a prospective
 
father-in-law obtains one; it is a sacred object and is carried in his hair
 
or hidden away.  The knives apparently have handles lashed on in their
 
original use on the east coast; handles are not used by the western aborigi-
nes.  They may be sharpened by biting them.
 
After the circumcision the youth sits up with a fire on each
 
side of him (he walks to it immediately after the operation) and keeps warm.
 
He is not t allowed to lie down until his wounds heal and it is considered
 
very important to keep his wounds warm.
 
After circumcision, the youth wears the tassel given to his bride
 
(it is taken back from her) and his hair is boun d up  in a woman
's sty
le
.  
He is considered a woman thou h he lives in hche1or cm  '
intj1 suhincisien.
 
Subjncision comes next.
 The oocrator here is a skilled exa ert, not the
 
Lather-in-law.
 It is a very delicate o
r,eration and the penalties for mnkin
 
a mistake are high.
 If the man gem operating goes wrong,  there may be a
 
real battle; the groups bring their spears and the emotional temperature
 
is hot.  i
t It is a situation fraught with danger, both sacred and secular.
 
'
he operation here is done with a small flake of stone; afterwards,  the
 
watching men self-operate recuttirig their own slightly grown together
 
"arts.
 
As soon as the operation is over,  the boy is set by a fire, warmed.
 
and his hair is done up like a mans; in his hair he hides t
he sacred ob-
jects which are now entrusted to him.
 
The last stage of the ceremony is the knocking out of a tooth at
 
which time he receives his bride.
 This comes some time later, months
 
nerLaps.
 
(
In the circumcision ceremony,  the boy is carried to the table
 
curled up in a fetal position; apparently he is symbolically born; then
 
a is a half-man; after subincision he is a full man; after the tooth
 
aremony he is a married man.)
 
In Arnhe±mland  is the only place where the culture is actually going
 
full blast now.  There circumcision takes place when the boys are about
 
eight or nine years old.
 Therefore much of the instruction is passe d on 
to 
C
D 
them in a simpler form by the use of string figures and much emphasis
 
on off-stage noises and ghostly voices.
 These little boys are somewhat
 
frightened into receiving their education rather than taught in the ways
 
of the desert people.
 
Notes during film:  After the blood-letting,  the fathers of the sons to
 
be initiated (circumcision) depart from the two grouns weeping and lie
 
on the ground and cry.
 Their sons have been taken from them and turned
 
over to the father in law.
 But it is the father who rewards the boy
 
after the circumcision by tying the hair up as a half man and giving him
 
some of the trappings of a man.
 
After several years (post-circumcision) the young
 
man kxxximmxxvnxxtmgxtkigxztoick7sxxaf
cxxxkxtfxmxn is subincised.
 Up to this
 
time he has been wearing the clothes of a half-man; he is regarded as an
 
imperfect person who has to be perfected in order to be a real man.
 Western
 
desert men have very little respect for those people who do not use these
 
ceremonies and regard them as women.
 This includes whites; when they fir , 
x saw white men they regarded them as men or women denending on wheth€
 
they had been circumcised or not; when they later saw white women,  th
 
hd to revise their opinions.
 
The Australian desert soil is so sterile that infec •:w
 
rarely occur.
 The operations are performed so that there is very little
 
bleeding; but in the arm blood-letting, the wound is stopped by handfuls
 
of dust when they rite is over.
 
Dr. Fry has suggested that the whole idea of subin-
cision migk k might have been started by the case of someone who had the
 
ipe or tube of the penis blocked.
 
After the subincision, while the
, young men are havin
 
their hair tied up all the older men lie down and cry, ritually.
 Then
 
the old men voluntarily mutilate themselves, making little cuts or takir
 
off small pieces of flesh, either by self-operation or having another I
(
-
it.  Afterwards the young men who have been operated on a few years a­

only by a friend from behind; these reoien the healing t

ctra together of the pipe that has ,r gone on during the inter-
vening time.
 
As a result of subincision, the penis becomes a flat flan
 
of flesh.  After the operation everybody starts trimming little pieces
 
off the±selves to increase the flatness xnd of the penis and cause it to
 
retract.
 This may conceivably have a utilitarian pur!,ose to hunters who
 
run after game completely naked.
 
After this, everybody sits around smoking fires and warn
 
themselves; the old men then dance the side wayw jumping dance; they
 
stab themselves with little flakes of stone in the genetals and dance
 
again (sprinkling blood on the ground?) This ends the ceremony; this is
 
the most cricical and elaborate xx of Australian ceremonials; one of the
 
most extraordinary in the world.

It is gradually through life that a man learns the techniques of his life
 
needs and gradually becomes skilled at them.
 So it is the old men who know
 
how to do pressure flaking of stone; and they are considered the experts
 
even after the age when they can hardly see what they're doing.  Australia
 
is bhe only place in the world where you can see Old Stone Age and Meso-
lithic tools in use and understand their function; in other narts of the
 
world we only find these artifacts as relics.
 
One of the most important things that I learned (Tindale) as
 
Australians is that all tools have multiple functions: primary and secon-
dary at least.
 (He showed us a stone blade sent in the end of a shaft
 
about 18 inches long being attached by a ball of resin molded to both
 
shaft and blade -
-
 a little larger than a golf ball and quite hard (
the
 
resin, that is.4  The stone blade was edged along its long side like
 
a scraper; Dr. T. said it could be used as an adze, a weanon, a chisel
 
and he had even seen men nicking their teeth with it.)
 
Ir Dr. T
. nassed out l
ists of radio carbon datincs for Polynesian and
 
Australian artifacts.
 
In both lists the Niah cave child is detailed and described; :adio-Caro-
dating then indicates that Australia has been occupied by 9 aborigine
 
for 25,000 years.
 During the first half of that period the tools were o
 
an unspectacular type: rounded pebbles with large chips taken off one
 
side. followed '
by smaller chips; they are six to seven inches long and
 
represent a general purpose tool.
 
usually
 
This type of tool/weighs in the general area of 18 ounces; some are around
 
22 ounces and others around 9 or 10 ounces.  In narts of Australia where
 
there are no river-washed pebbles t similar tools are made of more irre-
gular stone blocks.
 For heavy work. 44 to 45 ounce blocks xy of stone
 
are used; they are symmetrical in shape and therefore are constructed
 
to be usud held in two hands.
 This is a very old generalized tool
 
and one which was in use in Asia 40,000 years ago.
 According to the evi-
dence of the Niah Cave,  they went out of fashion in Borneo about 32,000
 
years ago and a newer type of tool came in.
 
t is evident that around 32,000 something must have been pushing people
 
bout and something made man leave Borneo and start on the migration
 
hich r n ut eventually reached Australia; this is obvious because he
 
came to Australia before he learned how to make better tools (Niah cave
 
later deposits show more advanced tool-making).
 This extremely simple
 
type of tool-making has been named the Kartan culture; it was first
 
observed on Kangaroo Island which was probably separated from Australia
 
around 6 to 7000 years ago (the two were joined together during the Ice
 
Age.)  The mainland natives  who could see Kangaroo Island in the distance
 
hut could never go there cailed it  arta -
-
 the island of the dead; hence
 
the name "Kartan culture".
 
imilar implements have been found in larce areas in South-east Asia;
 
in various levels of cultural t strata you get this nicture:
 
'
herefore it has been inferred that perhaps the original inhabitants t
 
with newer incoming peoples and acquired newer implements but hung on to
 
the old as well.  This kind of culture (Kartan) in south east Asie is
 
called: Hoabhinian. 
It was described by Madame Colani some time ago
 
but very little dating has been done.
 Radio-carbon tests have not h
ren
 
a
'olied (war going on,  I presure).
 Early Hoabhinian is very similar to
 
hartan, and the terms a
i,pear to be used by anthropologists inter-changa
 
when applied to Australia.
 
i
eabhinian or Kartan tools have been found in Tasmania and all over Austr-4i
 
as well as on Kangaroo Island.
 They must gx have therefore been brough
 
in during Ice Age times; they were probably the implements brought with
 
the first immigrants.
 They are found with the body of a child in the
 
Cave at 42.000; therefore we had a Kartan Hoabhinian culture widesprea"
 
in Asia around the middle of the Wxii 1.

efore.
 Even the physical form is being changed within our century.

hole genetic traits, custons, beliefs, acquisitions, new knowledaes

 It i

important then that researchers should go into the field.

subjecting reactions.
 they must be trained to record this knowledge
 
r
nroperly, and lastly it must be presented and published.
 Because of the
-
relatively small publishing facilities, much field note information lies
 
about for years.
 So it must be recorded in such a way that others can
 
make use of it.
 If you don't record your information immediately, you
 
may synthesize if unconsciously with information learned somewhere else.
 
Once you become a researcher and receive a research grant, you have the
 
responsibility of recording, preserving and promulgating.
 Never go to
 
bed in the field at night until you have written down everything you have
 
done that day -
-
 not just in garbled words -
-
 but in the form o? a journal.
 
One of the important things about a journal is that it would be com lete1y
 
intelligible to somebody else, and it should also be legible.
 You should
 
feel that you are publishing a book in one cony.
 If you are writing down
 
a native word, it should be printed (as in italics,  to carry the book si-
mile further)  One of the most important things is to watch for unconscious
 
synthesis in the field.
 Write down what you  hear nt the  
t
ime; this is t
he
 
way you can later distinguish variation.
 
The bound form of notebook is the best; don't use looseleaf.
 The nearer
 
your notebook is to book form,  the easier it is to handle; for one thine.
 
our culture has taught us how to handle books and to be careful of them.
 
The pages should be numbered.
 Write on
 
*ø
i one page (as the book is opened) only and leave the facing page
 
blank for the inevitable additions; this also lumps the accretions and
 
afterthoughts together and allows you to be able to evaluate them later.
 
The primary data is then preservable as  a whole.
 T
he journal l
inks to-
;
ether all the experiences you have.
 
As you go along, you should maintain a senarate volume for an index; nut
 
letter at the the top of every few pages and then enter each item or
 
subject you record in your index in rough alphabetical order.
 This will
 
'
:
reatly facilitate your checking back for items later.
 Tindale also
 
carries a couple of other notebooks for covering his own  special interests;
 
in these he records data concerning his private hobby-horses: primitive
 
camping sites for example.
 In this way you are iub1ishirr  rrtvxtexirfvx
 
nrimary information for yourself in one copy.
 
Ass soon as possible, get typed copies of your journals made in dunlicate
 
or triplicate; have these bound and denosit them in a library or college
 
for safe-beenin .
 Since mnthro"oloaists frecuently get information which
 
cr
n never be obtained again,  the second stage of preserving is very im-
nortant.
 If you are planning an expedition, allow in the primary budget
 
for the expenses of copying and binding of books and their preservation.
 
Again he urged binding, pointing out that neonle don't steal or damage
 
books as easily as they will other items -
-
 or lose them; we are cultur.-'lly
 
trained to take care of books.
 Be sure to get the typist to follow the
 
pagination of the original journal -
-
 not follow it exactly but to nut
 
the field journal nage number in the margin w
 s
xt x
 so that
 
the typed copy will correspond with your field index.
 
One of the most difficult problems is the tying in of exact data w
ith
 
photography; it must be kept track of right then. One of the fatal
 
takes is to number the photograph and simply make a list (which you
 
then lose).  The only solution is to write ax the full information
 
every negative; have a number if you like, but too often a number is just
 
a lame excuse for not writing the label on the print.
 You should further
 
keep a list of pictures made in the journal, including the angle and di-
rection of the shots taken.
 Pr Tindale writes on each (roun(l the mircins)
 
of his s
lides:
 
Classifying name
 
Pestription and detailing of scene
 
Photographic detail -
 exposure, lens etc.
 
name of photographer -
 do not use intials, write out in full
 
Pate
 
eference to the journal entry where the shot is describe `
 
A directional mark (to be sure picture is not floppe(l)
 
e also writes on each negativc
 
margin:
 
Classifying titic
 
Negative number
 
Desctiption of shot and date
 
The scientific study of Anthronology starts with the objective recording
 
of what you have witnessed in time.
 Even when taping, write down imme-
diately what you heard into your journal; (Greenway added later that all
 
tapes should have leader spliced on to them immediately with a resume of
 
the information the tapes contain.) In the journal you should also des-
cribed the main scenes of movie footage you have shot; be sure to include
 
directional information and orientation of the shot.
 
in connection with physical relics, Tindale takes an implement or stone,
 
lays it on his notebook and draws a rough outline around it, adding by
 
ski sketching, enough detail so that it can later be recognized.
 This
 
revents the later misidentification of material.
 Otherwise, how do you
 
know which rock you picked up where?
 Make a quick sketch, only the major
 
details, but enough to fix it in your mind.
 
Tindale said rather sadly that it takes a l
ot of proof to kill a mistaken
 
niece of data in anthropology.
 If you make one mistake, it may take eight
 
or ten onposing pieces of information to correct it.
 He also remarked
 
that he draws a pencil line at the bottom of the journal page whenever
 
he uses a fact or item from that page in published naners; this is to
 
nrevent redundancy or basing too much on the same niece of evidence.

In  response  to  questions :
 
The  aborigines  believe  that  on death  everyone goes  to Kangaroo
 
nd  becomes  white.
 In their  actual  burial  customs,  the  cornse  is  fr ,
 
wmv quently preserved by smoking it, which actually turns the corpse
 
white; therefore when the first Euroneans came they were welcomed (
ai.
 
sometimes to the European's surprise, identified and recognized by the
 
boriginals who believed they were returning snirits.
 
The Tiwi have been cut off from Australia since the rise of water at the
 
end of the Ice Age.
 They had no boats so were isolated except that many
 
I
alaysians had been coming down the coast for years to kidnap slaves for
 
work in their country.
 So they had had some contact with northern cul-
tures.
 The Tiwi, for both these reasons, should not be used to illus-
trate the Australian aborigine.
 
It seems to be fairly clear that there is a resemblance between the Aus-
?
 tralian languages and the Pavilland

The first contact with whites had a drastic effect on full bloods.  (He
 
showed a shot of a mission funeral wtxx
ioaut I would guess of about fifty
 
years ago.) In spite of the care of the missionaries,  the coughs, colds
 
and oneumonias they gave the aborigines resulted in funeral rites being
 
the most frequent ritual observance nracticed in the missions.
 
There is an obvious trend for the fuliblood to disappear.
