(Tc:: transcribed fro
 PFK interview with Bessie Jones by
 
Ed Cray, broadcast on FtCi
 O1 TILL SUiDAY, su-mmer. 1
963.)
 
Juba, Juba,
 
Juba this and Juba that
 
And Juba killed a yellow cat
 
And give up (
?) a double trouble,
 
Juba.
 
(possibly us)
 
You sift-a the meal, you give :
i
ie the husk,
 
You cook-a the bread, you give me the crust
 
You fry the meat, you give ne the skin
 
And that is where  w ma:
's trouble begin,
 
And then you Juba,
 
And the
 oü'Juba
 
Juba up, Juba down,
.
 
Juba all around the town
 
Juha for n
a, Juba for pa
 
Juba for your brother-in-law,
 
You just Juba,
 
You just Juba.
 
During the first part of the song, through "that is how
 
, rs. Jones slaps her thighs with her hands
 
my mama's trouble begin"
 
instead of clapping thetn together.
 uring the first two  i
easures,
 
(Juba, Juba"), working to an eve n  co unt  -
-
 one, two,  three, four,  -
-
 
she alternates tapping
' her feet and slapping both thighs with her
 
hands.
 (See music transcriptioa).
 
At the words,  "Juba this and Juba that", she be i s a
 
double time rhythm  (
one-and, two-and, three-and,  four-and),
 eyi ng
 
her hands as follows:
 
one
 slap left thi h with left hand
 
and
 slap right thigh with ri ht hand
. (
leave hand on thigh)
 
two
 slap back of right hand  resting on thigh) with left hand
 
and
 slap right thigh with right hand
 
three
 slap le t thigh with left hand (
leave hand on thigh)
 
and
 slap back of left hand (
restin g on thigh) with right hand
 
four
 slap left thigh with left hand
 
and
 slap right thigh wi t
h ri ht hand. (
leave on thigh)
 
one
 slap back of right hand ?restiiig
, on thigh) with left hand
 
and
 slap right thigh with right hand
 
etc.
 
3 
e to co n  out ev
; the fact that it does not pro-
-
 -ion that is the char
;L of this rhythmic pattern.
 
Ioks much I
 nrder to do than it is in practice; try
 
the pattern alone at first, without the cha:t, eTc
1 you will be surprised
 
at how natural a sequence of movements it is.
 
t the same time, Irs. zones taps her feet in a single
 
couit of four (one, two, three, four), tapping her right heel and
. left
:
 
toe simultaneously, then the left heel and the right toe.
 If you move
 
your feet back and forth as though you were walking while you try this,
 
it is sli.htiy easier.
 
At the wo Cs "Juba up, Juba do
',
 r5. Jones begins to clap
 
her bands together and tap her feet  i
i
 the u
:ual manner; this rhythi
i
 
is indicated over the music.

This is just a pat, and then it goes into a dance.  You pat like this:  
Tuba, um*j
1uii,
 
Juba,
 
Juba this-414%
, 
Juba that-.
'
 
Juba kill that yellow cat
 
An' Juba' s a double trouble,
 
Juba.
 
You si'-a the meal,
 
You gi rie the husk,
 
You cook-a the bread,
 
You  imme the crust,
 
You fry-a the meat,
 
You gi mme  the skin,
 
An' that's how, Mama,
 
The trouble begin,
 
Juba.
 
And then you dance the '
tjuba."
