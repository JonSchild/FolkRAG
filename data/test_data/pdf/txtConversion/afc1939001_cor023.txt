[Letter from John A. Lomax to Mr. A. J. Dornbush]
Port Aran sas,Texas March 27, 1939
Mr. A.J.Dornbush Washington,D.C.
Dear Mr. Dornbush:
Your special airmail letter reached me this morning. I enclose herewith copies of two
letters I wrote last night which will help give you a clearer idea of the situation at this end
of the line. I have had the most meager in formation to work on,and your letter is the first
intimation that a decision must be made quickly. I may add further in response to your
specific inquiries:
1. Oscar Fox spoke of possibly four singers. He accompanies them on the piano. He
mentioned the possibility of “Tex” Ritter joining his group, a very uncertain matter. Only
yesterday be notified me that he was driving from San Antonio to see me Wednesday of
this week. I'll wire you about him then in case I decide to change my recommendation.
2. With the information that I have before me, I think your best bet is the San Angelo
group. (See enclosed a letter from their straw boss and my reply thereto;also a copy of my
letter to Harold Spivacke.) I don't know whether they sing BOOTS AND SADDLE”. They
sing and play as nearly like the old rangers as any I have heard. I think they use a fiddle or
two. But you must remember that the original breed of cowboy yodelers is as extinct as the
dodo.
3. I am sending a copy of this letter to Harold Broome at San Angelo and likewise to Mr.
Spivacke. You are therefore in position to communicate direct with Mr. Broome unless I
find through Mr. Fox information that will cause me to change my mind.
