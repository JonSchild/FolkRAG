[Letter from Harold Spivacke to Carita Doggett Corse,
August 21, 1939]
August 21, 1939
Dr. Carita Doggett Corse State Director, Federal Writers' Project 49 West Duval Street
Jacksonville, Florida
Dear Dr. Corse:
Thank you for your kind letter of August 17 and for the interesting report which arrived
at the same time. I am pleased to learn that the question about shipments has been
straightened out but there still remains the question about the needles. Your telegram
stated that you received thirty two needles whereas we only ordered four.
We shall send you additional discs as soon as we receive them from Presto. At this point,
I should like to warn you regarding the handling of the recorded discs. Please instruct your
assistants to refrain from playing these more than once or twice at the most. They must
never be used for demonstration purposes. As soon as a certain number, say about ten,
have been recorded they should be sent to us for duplication. At the same time, we can
inspect their quality and make suggestions.
Have you begun to record yet? I see no reason for waiting until all the promised discs have
arrived. In fact, if the blanks lie around too long, they become dry and brittle.
Please keep us informed of the progress of your work and do not hesitate to call on us for
aid or advice.
Sincerely yours, Harold Spivacke Chief, Division of Music
