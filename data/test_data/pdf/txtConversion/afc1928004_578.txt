I'm hungry and tired, I've walked all the day; 
For ten long hours I've not had a 
meal— 
Don't set the dog on me I 
ain't going to steal; 
_Because I'm a 
tramp is that a 
disgrace? 
"You laugh as you slam the door in my face, 
see you are happy, with plenty of stamps, 
You have no pity for poor lonely tramps.

Oh, please have pity on we, a 
poor tramp. 
I've looked hard for work, believe me, it's true, 
The shops are all full so what can I 
do? 
Illy wife and my Nellie, my own darling child, 
Were struck down with fever and both of them died: 
No money, no friends, and nothing to eat, 
No home left for me tut the cold, lonely street; 
No shoes, no clothes, in a 
woodshed so damp 
sleep until daylight, then otre_rd I

EMPTY IS THE CELL, PATSY'S GONE. 
An original parody, written and sung by FRANK CAMPRRLIat 
America's Lightning Change Artist. 
AIL—Cradles Empty, Baby's Gone. 
I 
had a 
pal named Patsy, a 
bloke that knew his biz, 
At lifting leathers he was very fly; 
lie could use a 
jimmy or turn of any trick. 
He never let a 
racket pass him by. 
But Patsy fell at last, a 
copper nipped him up, 
The bracelets on his wrists they quickly sprung, 
The judge gave him a 
tener, to Sing Sing he did go, 
Lonely was the gang when he was gone. 
Cuoitus. 
6one to join the convicts on the Hudson shore, 
And in the quarry he was breaking stone; 
But Patsy he was happy, he swore he would break out, 
Lonely was the gang when he was gone. 
On last Monday morning to the quarry we did go, 
All the convicts marched there one by one; 
But when we went to work, the keeper he found out 
That little Patsy from that gang had gone. 
Patsy skipped the prison, they searched for him in 
vain, 
To join the gang in New York he had flown; 
trhe keepers they were cranky, the convicts they 
were glad. 
Empty is the cell now, Patsy's gone. - 
CHORUS. 
Gone to join the gang in Houston Street once more, 
And hide away until his hair grows long; 
And when the storm is over he'll work the ears again, 
'Empty is his cell now, he is gone.

They say I

THE McFADDEN BROTHERS. 
Written and composed by CHAS. A. 
BURKE, and sung with 
great success in all the Principal Theatres, by America's 
Sensational Change Artists', CAMPBELL & BURKE. 
We're the McFadden Brothers, 
Now ain't we peculiar ; 
Since first we came into this life, 
We don't care for show ; 
And we'll have you to know, 
That we've wore these bats all of our lives, 
But one thing we don't like, 
And they do it for spite, 
When they tell us go soak them in glue, 
To make them look stiff. 
But we don't care a 
whiff, • 
We'll not shoot the old bats for the new. 
CHORUS. 
So now take our advice though they'll say it looks nice, 
To wear others of different hue ; 
Arrah, what e'er you do, don't let them make you 
Ever shoot the old bat for the new. 
Now there's big Terence Doyle, 
'Wears one in grand style. 
When he's on the great avenue ; 
With his tight-legged trousers, 
And his skinny dog, Touser, 
He makes the sensation for you. 
But the people all say, when be passes their way, 
That he looks like a 
turkey cock-o-o. 
Which makes them all shout, 
See old Doyle he is out. 
He has shot the old bat for the new,

Kind friends, now your attention pray,

Success has crowned their efforts, 
For they are a 
gallant band.

Three rousing cheers now give 
For those hard- fisted willing hands. 
Without them none can live; 
The pride of our grand Republic, 
America's greatest friend ; 
The choicest. blessing that we have, 
Our hotwst workingmen. 
The greatest heroes that we've had, 
Sprung from our workingmen; 
And in our country's darkest hours, 
They proved who were our friends. 
Yes, they left their firesides and their friends, 
Their country's flag to save; 
Undaunted and unterrified, 
They filled a 
martyr's grave. 
Then hurrah for honest labor, etc.

We're back from the parade, my boys, 
With banners in our hands; 
Foruinst the people we did drill. 
A 
gay and gallant band. 
'Twas Uncle Sam, our own true friend, 
Who greeted one and all, 
And blessed the gallant Irishman 
Who zuswered to the call. 
fis we marched along the street, 
All the people us did greet, 
They called us their bold laddie bucks. 
And said we looked so neat; 
They said we were their pets, 
And upon us they made bets. 
That wo could outbate any squad 
Whoever took a 
step. 
CHORUS. 
As we marched around, around, around, 
The captain gives command, 
That all the boys who were in sound, 
Should join our gallant band. 
So we marched abreast, like all the rest, 
Where heroes congregate, 
Sure Irishmen will neer forget 
The story we relate. 
Now there was Mulcabey and Muldoon, 
Arrayed in grandest style, 
With bran new suits, just like a 
groom, 
They marched along for miles. 
With eyes to the front, the music played 
Their martial airs so grand. 
Bight shoulder shift arms, the order conios, 
We quicIily obey the command. 
KRAUSS, BAND.

Jr you now will listen

For it's Krauss he is our leader, 
And he is big and stout, 
I 
tell you what, we do look fine, 
Whenever we go out. 
CHORUS. 
For as we march through the street,,  
With music playing sweet, 
We hear the cry on every hand 
There's them Dutchmen, ain't they grand ? 
And when we tarn out, 
All the boys do shout 
flip, hurra I

Here comes Krauss' bawl 
And when we do turn out, 
We don't put on some airs, 
We march so fine we keep in time, 
The people at us Aare ; 
And when we pass the ladies by, 
They say that we look grand, 
For I

That march in Krauss' band. 
For as we march, etc. 
We have the best of music, 
Believe me that is so, 
And every one admires us, 
No matter where we go. 
We have the tune called " Skidmore Guards,' 
And also" Hyrue sweet Hyme," 
And every one does cheers us, 
For they say that we play flue.

MARY ANN, riz TELL YOUR MA. 
Written and Composed by GEOFFREY TROPX. 
Sting With great success by ToNY PASTOR-
, 
The music of this song is published by E. H. HARDING, 220 Bower, 
New York. Price 10 cents. 
I 
spoon a 
girl named Mary Ann, &tender little dove, 
Who costs me lots of half-pence, and a 
precious deal of love; 
She's living with her mother, as a maiden ought to do, 
And looks as straight and proper as a 
saint, or me or you. 
But somehow when I 
trot her round, no matter where we go, 
I'm struck with all the people that this maiden seems to know: 
For certain as Mary Ann I 
proudly take about, 
Some heads pop round the corner, and a 
vulgar voice will shwa... 
Oh, very well, Mary Ann, I'll tell your ma, 
She little thought when you came out you'd go so far, 
I'm sure your mother doesn't know the girl you are, 
Mary Ann, Ilel for shame, Yahl yahl yahi Ohl yahl 
We went last Whitsun Monday to the forest by the rail, 
We did the thing first class of course, at that I 
never fail; 
X 
tipp'd the guard a 
shilling, or what you might call a 
bob, 
To lock us in a 
carriage and preserve us from the mob. 
We sat on downy cushions and the curtains drew for fun. 
For Polly said her pretty ayes they could not bear the sum, 
But when we settled snugly gad were just about to go 
A 
head came through the window and a 
fellow shouted— 
Oh, very well. MA 
We wander'd through the forest glades as happy as could be! 
We thought from vulgar people there, we should at least be free, \ 
We sought a 
sweet secluded spot, where none our vows could hear, 
And whisper'd those soft, silly things, that lovers think so dear. 
We sat beneath a 
spreading oak, our loving arms entwined, 
While I 
was fond and foolish, she was gentle, sweet and kind; 
But just as I 
my passion told, and sealed it with a 
kiss, 
A. chap birds-nesting up above, so rudely shouted this— 
Oh, very well, etc. 
We came away disgusted, and we quickly made for home, 
For everywhere we met the cry, no matter where we'd roam. 
My Mary Ann deslared to me she knew those people not, 
In fact, she said she would not mix with such a 
vulgar lot. 
But on this precious mystery I 
have some little doubt, 
And a,most think that Mary Ann must know her way a'cout, 
For when we parted at her door, or rather just inside, 
e 
voice came down the staircase, ttud bar little brother cried—

11)1 TELL THEM TO STOP. 
As sung by Coot. BURGESS. 
No doubt you L ve heard of the great fancy fair, 
That used to bake place every day; 
Well, I 
thought for amusement I'd take my 
girl there 
To pass a 
dub hour away. 
We went in you must know and saw Barnum's Great 
Show, 
Van Amburgh s 
Menagerie as well; 
There were rou.adabouts, swings and all kind of 
things, 
Forget the da) I 
never shall. 
SPOKEN. —Yes, when we got to the fair my girl 
wanted to have a 
ride on one of the swings. 
I 
said: 
"All right, my darling," and we had a 
swing; but 
directly the swing went to and fro, she lustily called 
out: 
Clic:ay& 
Oh, Fred! tell them to stop! 
That was the cry of Maria; 
But the more she said whoa! they said let it go, 
And the swing went a 
little bit higher. 
The people that stood round, of course they all laughed 
But I 
only said stop the swing; 
There were four or five others in the boats beside us, 
Saying, master, don't do such a 
thing. 
'Twits then that some roughs caught hold of the ropes, 
Maria fell down on her knee, 
And one of them said, the young man's turning red, 
But isn't he having a 
spree. 
Oh, Fred! eta 
They soon stopped the awing and Maria got out, 
And quickly fell down on the floor; 
They brought ker some water, which soon brought 
her to, 
This girl whom I 
now do adore. 
Should you ever go there to the great fancy fair, 
Friends, take advice while I 
sing, 
Of the great roundabout, i's the best fun that's out, 
And finish the day with a 
swing. 
SPOKEN. — Mark now, before you get into ths 
swing's boat, make a 
bargain with your young lady. 
Oh, Fred eta,

There is a great sensation, about a 
word you hear 
nowadays, 
The boys and girls all use it, it's about going to the

It's either Charles or Emma. " Are you going to the

By chance I 
met a 
lady friend, I 
knew for many a 
day, 
went with her a 
walking, and I 
left her on Broad-
way, 
And the time that we were parting, she winked at 
me and laughed, 
And then said " Good-morning, Harry, are you going 
to the mat this aft?" 
"Are you going to the mat, ete. 
When boys are kissing pretty girls, they don't know 
what to say, 
They commence to give them earaches, of new things 
out to day; 
She'll say, " Don't waist your breath •tang, we've 
heard the best and last— 
The latest of the season is, " Are you going to the

minute, a 
stone's got in my shoe; 
Dont you commence your cussin', I 
ain't done nothin' 
to you. 
Yes, I'm a 
tramp. 
What of it? 
Folks say we ain't 
no good, 
But tramps has to live, I 
reckon, though folks don't 
think we should. 
Once I 
was strong and handsome, had plenty of cash 
and clothes, 
That was afore I 
tippled and gin got into my nose. 
Down in Lehigh Valley me and people grew, 
I 
was a 
blacksmith, cap'en—yes, and a 
good one too; 
Me and my wife and Nellie—Nellie was just sixteen, 
She was the pootiest creature the Valley had ever seen, 
Beaux? Why she had a 
dozen—had em from near 
and fur, 
But they were mostly farmers, none of 'em suited her. 
There was a 
city stranger, young, handsome and tall, 
Damn him—I 
wish I 
had him strangled °On that wall. 
He was the man for Nellie—the didn't know no 111; 
Mother, she tried to stop it, but you know a 
young 
gal's will. 
Well, it's the same old story—common enough, you'll 
say, 
He was a 
soft-tongued devil, and got her to run away. 
More than a 
month after we heard from the poor 
young thing, 
He'd gone away and left her without a 
wedding ring. 
Back to her home we brought her, back to her moth! 
er's side, 
Fill'd with a 
raging fever—she fell at my 
feet and died. 
Frantic with shame and trouble, her mother began to 
sink, 
Dead—in less than a 
fortnight—that's when I 
took 
to drink. 
Gimme one glass, Curnel, and then r11 be"on my way,

While strolling one night through New York's gay throng, 
I

poor boy, he was singing a 
song; 
Although he was singing, he wanted for bread, 
And though he was smiling, he wished himself dead.

He had no home to shelter him, no place to go. 
!Co mother to guide him, in the grave she is low, 
Cast on the cold street was poor little Joe. 
OHOBUs. 
Cold blew the blast, down came the snow, 
lie had no place to shelter him, no place to go; 
No mother to guide him, in the grave she is low; 
Cast on the cold street is poor little Joe. 
A 
carriage passed by with a 
lady inside, 
looked on poor Joe's face, and saw that he cried; 
He followed the carriage, she not even smiled 
-Rut fondly carressing her own darling child. 
X 
looked on this waif, I 
thought it was odd, 
Is this poor ragged urchin forgotten by God ? 
And I 
saw by the lamp light that shone on the snow, 
The pale, deadly features of poor little Joe. 
Cold blew the blast, etc. 
The light had gone out, the clock had struck one, 
Along came a 
policeman, whose duty was done; 
t
-ould tell by the sound of his dull, heavy tread, 
You'd think he was sinking the graves of the dead, 
Oh ! what is this ? the policeman, he said, 
lb was poor little Joe, on the ground he lay dead. 
With his eyes turned to Heaven, covered with snow. 
Died in the cold street. did poor little Joe.

A ROLLING STONE GATIIERS NO MOSS. 
Sung by AN NAST'. 
As we pass along life, how many we see, 
And many. there are to be found 
Who are never contented where'er they may be, 
Ahd so constantly come to the ground. 
They Always are changing for this and for that, 
Though for reasons they're quite at a 
loss. 
It brings to our mind the saying so pat, 
A rolling stone gathers no moss. 
C 
H 
ORUS. 
So always stick firmly to what you've in view, 
Don't be dazzled by glitter and gloss, 
Remember the maxim, so old yet so true, 
A 
rolling stone gathers no moss. 
Some people there are, they go in for trade, 
And scarcely stay at it a 
week, 
For they quickly will say a 
mistake they have :made, 
And for something quite different seek. 
And then, when at last, they make a 
fresh start, 
It's just the same thing as before. 
A year hardly goes, they again from it part, 
So these people they live and die poor. 
0 
With love, a 
young man falls into its snare, 
And tries to obtain a 
young wife, 
But of constancy true he doe not take care, 
So single remains all his life. 
Many ladies we know the saute pathway will trafeep

For it will make you glad ; 
in the golden rays its shadow it will mock you; 
And whirl and dance like mad.

Written expressly for JOILNPON AND SWAIN, by .1.tidEs F. DooLET, 
We've just dropped in to dance and sing, ) 
And please you for awhile, 
And want you to observe us,

They say we have no peers, 
And we've lately gained the cognomen

We're always flush, and ne'er 
No matter where we go, 
And when we're out, without

Adore these cavaliers, 
For there's none can mash, or cut a

With the Broadway Belvederes,

But we cannot linger longer. 
For to Washington we go, 
We're engaged to learn the senators 
To shake the heel and toe, 
For the whole of them are crazy, 
And are anxious to appear, 
In graceful songs and dances 
Like the Broadway Belvederes.

ANNIE AND WiLLIE'S PRAY-ER. 
By Sopnik: P. 
Recited during the holidays by HAanv Bftuso, 
Published by requist. 
'Twas the eve before Christmas, ' good night " had 
been Said, 
And Annie and Willie had crept into bed; 
There were tears on their pillows and tears in their 
eyes, 
And each little bosom was heaving with sighs; 
For to-night. t 
heir stern father's commatid had been 
given 
That they should retire precisely at seven— 
Instead of eight-- for they troubled him more 
With questions unheard of than ever before. 
He told them he thought this dclusion asin--
No such person as " Santa. Clan s " ever had been--
And he hoped, after this, he should never more hear 
Bow he scrInabled down chimneys with presents 
each year. 
And this was the reason that two little heads 
So restlessly tossed on their soft, downy beds. 
Eight, nine, and the clock on the steeple tolled ten; 
Not a 
word had been spoken by either till then, 
When Willie's sad face from the blanket did peep 
As he whispered: " Dear Annie, is 'ou fas' asleep?" 
"Why, no, Brother Willie," a 
sweet voice replies; 
"I've long tried in vain, but 1 
can't shut my eyes, 
For somehow it makes me so sorry because 
Dear papa has said there is no Santa Claus. 
Now, we know there is, and it can't be denied 
For he came every year before mamma died; 
But, then, I've been thinking that she used to pray, 
And God would hear everything mamma would say, 
And maybe she asked him 
to send Santa Claus here 
With the sack full of presents he brought every year." 
•' Well, why tan't we pray dust as mamma did den, 
And ask Dot to send hitn with presents aden?" 
" 
Fve been thinking 60 too," and without a ,'ord 
more

ANNIE AND WILLIE'S PRAYER. 
(0,1ilintled.) 
And four little knees the soft carpet pressed. 
And two tiny hands were clasped close to each breast. 
" 
Now. Willie, you know that we must firmly believe 
That the presents we ask for we're sure to receive; 
You must wait just as still 
till I 
say the ' Amen,' 
And by that you will know that your turn -
Juts Con ,tt 
Dehl' 
look down on my brother and me, 
And grant us the favor we are asking of Thee. 
I 
want a 
NI. ax dolly, a 
tea- set and ring, 
And an ebony work- box that shuts with a 
spring. 
13;css. papa, dear Jesus, and cause him to see 
That Santa Claus loves in; as much as does he: 
Don't jet hint get fretful and ativr.; again 
At dear -Brother Willie and Annie. 
Amen. 
" 
teleas ,, 
Doe- us, I. t 
Santa Taus num down to- night, 
And bring uts some presents_ before ii is light; 
I 
want he should div me a, nice ' ittle sod, 
With bright shining 'miners, and all painted red; 
A boN. full of tandy, a 
book and a 
toy. 
Amen, and den, Deesus, I'll be a 
dood boy. 
Their prayers being ended, they raised 
up their 
heads, 
And, with hearts light and cheerful, again sought 
their beds. 
They were soon lost in slumber both peaceful and 
deep, 
And with fairies in dreamland were roaming in sleep. 
Eight, nine, and the little French clock had ,- trtn:k 
ten 
rire the father had thought of his childrn onain. 
Ile seems now to hear Annie's half-supp,essed 
And to see the big tears stand in Willie's blue eyes. 
" 
I 
was harsh with my darlings," he mentally said, 
" 
And should not have sent them's° eariv to bed; 
But then 1. was troubled; my feelings found vent, 
For bank-stock to-day has gone down ten per cent; 
1" 
f 
nr tr,e 
they've forgotten their trott 
this, 
(Conte 
And that I 
denied them the thrice-asked-for kiss; 
And, just to make sure, I'll steal up to the door, 
For I 
never spoke harsh to my darlings before." 
So saying, he softly ascended the stairs, 
And arrived at the door to hear both of their prayers; 
His .Annie's •' Bless papa!" drew forth the big tears, 
And Willie's grave promise fell sweet on his ears. 
" trange---strange—I'd forgotten," sa id he wit It a 
sigh, 
"Ho 
I 
longed when a child to have Christmas 
draw nigh. 
atone for my harshness," he inwardly said. 
*** By answering their prayers ere I 
sleep in may bed." 
Then turned to the stairs and softly went down, 
Threw off velvet slippers and silk dressing gown, 
Donned hat, coat and boots, and was out in the 
• streets. 
A millionaire facing the cold, driving sleet! 
Nor stopped he until he had bought everything. 
From the 140.K• full of candy to the tiny gold ring; 
Indeed, Ile kept adding so much to his store 
That the various presents outnumbered a 
score; 
Then homeward he turned, when his holiday load, 
With Aunt Mary's help in the nurse‘ry was stowed, 
Miss.. 
Dolly was seated beneath a 
pine tree, 
By 
si:le of a 
table spread out for her tea; 
A work- tar.: well tilled in the centre was laid, 
And cm it the ring for which Annie had prayed; 
A soldier in uniform stood by a 
sled, 
" 
With bright shining runners, and all painted red;" 
There were balls, dogs and horses, books pleasing to 
see. 
And birds of all colors were perched in the tree: 
While Santa Claus, laughing, stood up in the top, 
As if get t 
inEr ready more presents to drop. 
And, as the fond father the picture surveyed, 
Ile thoualn for his trouble he had amply been paid; 
And he said to himself as he brushed off a 
tear: 
ANNIE AND WILLIE'S PRAYER. 
(Conelodfat. ) 
" 
I'm nappier to-night than I've been for a 
ycar. 
I've enjoyed more true pleasure than ever before— 
What Care I 
if bank-stock falls ten per cent more? 
Horeafter 
make it a 
rule, I 
believe, 
To have Santa Claus visit us each Christmas- eve.' 
So thinking, lie gently extinguished the light, 
And tripping down stairs, he retired for the night. 
is soon as the beams of the bright morning sun 
Put the darkness to flight, and the stars one by one, 
1:7our little blue eyes out of sleep opened wide, 
And, at the same moment, the presents espied: 
Then out of their beds they sprang with a 
bound, 
And the very gifts prayed for were all of thenrfound. 
They laughed and they cried, hi. their innocent glee, 
And shouted for papa to come quick and see 
What presents old Santa Clans brought in the night 
iJust the things that they wanted), and left before 
light. 
" 
And now," added Annie in voice soft and low, 
• ' You'll believe there's it'Santa Claus,' papa, I 
know ;" 
While dear little Willie climbed up on his knee, 
Determined no secret between them should be, 
And told in soft whispers how Annie had said 
That their dear, blessed mamma, so long ago dead, 
Used to kneel down and pray by the side of her chair, 
And that God up in heaven had answered her prayer. 
"Den we dot up and prayed dust as well as we tood; 
And Dod answered our prayers; now, wasn't H4 
dood?" 
" 
I 
should say that He was if lie sent you all these, 
.knd knew just what presents my children would 
please. 
Well, well, let him think so. the dear little elf; 
•I'would be cruel to tell him I 
did it myself.") 
Blind father! Who caused your stern heart to relent, 
And the hasty words spoken so soon to repent? 
'Twas the Being who bade you steal softly upstairs, 
And me,de yon His agent to answer their prayers.

FACTORY BOY. 
Written for JOHNNY W ILLIAMS by ED. HARRIGAN. 
From dear old Albion's shore, 
It's lately I've come o'er 
To try to gain my fortune and a 
name; 
From old Manchester town, 
Where I've rattled up and down, 
And put the other fa ctory boys to shame. 
With a 
pair of wooden shoes, 
Which hard knocks never bruise, 
After working hard all day I've danced away with joy, 
And the neighbors out to ride, 
Would stop at the old roadside, 
Admiring the nimble touches of this jolly factory boy. 
When I 
get through my meal, 
I'd use my toe and heel, 
Just only to settle my dinner down, 
Then away to work I'd wing 
When rd hear the mill bell ring, 
No livelier lad for many miles around. 
One day I 
took 
French leave" - 
And I 
really do believe 
I 
will make my fortune here and a 
happy life enjoy; 
T 
was born to good luck. 
And I 
know that I

And I'll try to de.,,rvi , it like a

When I 
was but a 
little boy I 
used to go to school, 
*I was so very good some said I 
was a 
fool; 
But no, I'd never claim a thing that didn't belong 
to me, 
And now I'm just as honest and as truthful as can be; 
While walking down the street one day, by a 
police-
man I 
was stopped, 
Who said, " I 
think this purse of gold from your coat-
pocket dropped;" 
Now as I 
never carry one— I've so little cash, you 
see— 
Like an honest man said I 
at once, " it. don't belong 
to me." 
CHORUS. 
It don't belong to me, 
It don't belong to me, 
You'd better inquire of somebody .elses 
It don't belong to me, 
I 
never saw that purse before— 
It can't be mine, you see, 
I 
know nothing whatever about tht thing, 
it don't belong to me. 
IT DON'T BELONtk TO Al E. 
My wages being very small I 
live in humble style, 
But with the girls I 
lardy-dar and the agony pile; 
tell them almost anything, for I've got lots of 
cheek, 
They little think 1 
do the swell on fifteen dollars a. 
week. 
One day I. bought a 
bloater, whielt I 
popped inside 
my hat, 
-For I 
saw a lady coming along who I knew would 
stop and chat; 
My hat flew off, the bloater fell, the street boys 
laughed with glee, 
But when they brought it back said I, " It don't be-
long to me." 
I 
occupied a 
front room in a 
house away up toWn, 
And in the back there lived a girl—a 
Miss *
Teminta 
Brown; 
Where'r I chanced to meet her, well, I'd pass the 
time of day, 
And ! nye a 
little gossip in a 
friendly sort of way. 
The other night when I 
got home, oh, what a 
dread-
ful scene, 
The landlor,l, raving, asked of me, " What does all 
this mean? 
Miss Brown ba:q gone but left behind this infant, so 
yousee," 
Says I, " You quite surprise me, but it don't belong 
to me." 
It don't belong to me, etc.

KEEP IT ON THE 0.111ET. 
As song by Jovtr Faums/x. 
My friend he keeps a 
grocer's shop— 
mean the shop keeps him, 
And when I 
want to hear some news 
I 
always calls on Jem; 
He knows everybody's business, 
Also what they daily do, 
And if you listen unto me 
I'll tell them unto you. 
Cnonus. 
Bt 
don't make a 
row, don't make a 
riot,' 
Don't make a 
row, keep it on the quiet, 
For what I'm telling you perhaps may not be true, 
It's only what a 
friend told me. 
There's Augustus Smith, at Number One, 
A. something in the city. 
The ladies of him make such fun 
And look on hint with pity. 
For when his daily work is over, 
Straightway home he goes, 
Then fastens up the holes and cracks, 
And washes all the ei,thes. 
But don't make a 
row, etc. 
There's Mr,. 
Drew, at Number Two, 
Once a 
ealk in. 
And orders from hel. grocer 
A quart bottle of trin. 
Puts the amount down to her husband's at-
count, 
Then in a 
whisper she says, 
Don't make it a

l'ait it down a 
pound of tea.

KEEP IT ON THE QUIET. 
(Concluded.) 
There's Green he keeps a 
butcher's shop, 
And you must know, of late, 
The neighbors all declare 
That he's been giving them short weight 
lie tried to cheat his customers, 
In doing so did fail; 
They told me that a 
piece of fat 
Was found beneath the scale. 
But don't make a 
row, et*. 
There's a 
lady dresses very well, 
Whose name is Mrs. Brown, 
And when the tally-man calls there 
The blinds are always down; 
The servant says she has gone out, 
Which is not right, I'm sure; 
l`f he walk'd inside he find her hid 
Behind the kitchen door. 
But don't make a 
row, etc. 
There's Johnstone says he'll leave his wife, 
When asked the reason why, 
His answer now is simply this 
She only has one eye. 
The other, being made of glass, 
When fast asleep at night, 
One eye is closed in sweet repose, 
While the other's shining bright. 
But don't make a 
row, 6t,e,.

I 
am a 
man that's known far and near, 
I 
have a 
daughter, to me she is dear, 
But late I 
have noticed she acts rather queer, ) 
Since Abe saw the play veiled " Pinafore." 
It was Itt-t night a young man gare her a 
call, 
And took her to a 
show in our big City 11411; 
he Chine home that night and began for to bawl, 
With terrible, horrible roar. 
CHORUS. 
If I 
catch the man that wrote " Pinafore," • 
I'll break his jaw, knock him down on the floor,

Before he wrote h(Ptdly ecer. 
She's singhig from daylight till darkness appear ,. 
When she goes to bed and snores through her ear-. 
I 
often had wished she'd sleep for ton year-;, 
And forget all about " Pinafore." 
She thinks she is Buttercup dressed up in blue, 
Dick Deadeye, the sailor, she is going to pursue 
Across the deep waters that rages so blue,

terrible, horrible roar,

TAILOR. 
,ks sung by 0. P. 
HYLAND and JOE BLANCHARD with tremendous 
success. 
Now here we are from Erin's Isle, 
Two decent tradesmen sure you'll find us; 
flow do you like our fancy style? 
We've left our Sunday clothes behind us. 
We pawned our togs for our car fare, 
And drank the rest with a 
dry-land sailor; 
We are mending worse, like a 
Connaughtman's goat. 
Mickey the Snob and Johnny the Tailor. 
CHORUS. 
Tow-row-row, look at us now, 
We're a.s fly as any jailer, 
Fortune struck, we're in bad luck. 
Mickey the Snob and Johnny the Tailor. 
TAILOR. — When at home I 
lived at ease, 
A fancy shop I 
did there keep, sir. 
SNOB. — Oh, never mind what that man says, 
it's only the booze that makes him speak, sir. 
.11:1Atbox..—Now my stock in trade is gone, 
Here I 
am a 
sad bewailer, 
SNOB.•—You are just like a 
cow looking over a 
gate, 
Johnny McGurk, the drunken tailor. 
Tow-row-row, etc. 
TAILOR. — 
Mickey, now you'd better shut up, 
Lave us alone and stop your capering, 
SNOB. — But come away and I'll spend this clime 
And after that I'll hock my apron. 
110TH — And we'll be jolly while we may, 
In spite of either wind or weather, 
And while we have a 
dollar to spend, 
We'll drink success to cloth and leather. ;

Nigh to a 
grave that was newly made, 
Leaned a 
sexton old on his earth- worn spade,: 
His work was done, and he paused to wait 
The funeral train through the open gzite; 
A 
relic of by-gone days was he, 
And his locks were white as the foamy sea, 
And these words etune from his lips so thin ; 
I 
gather them in ! 
I 
gather them in ! 
Gather, gat her, gather, I 
gather them in. 
gather them in ! for man and 'Goy, 
Year after year of grief and joy.. 
I've budded the houses that lie around, 
In ev'ry nook of this burial ground , 
Mother and daughter, father and son, 
Come to my solitude one by one— 
But come they strangers or come they kin, 
I 
gather them 
hi ! 
I 
gather them in! 
Gather, 'gather, gather, gather them in ! 
I 
gather them in '.— and their final rest 
Is hero, down hero in the ea rtli•s dark bretest. 
And the sexton ceased- for the funeral train 
Wound mutely o'er that solemn plain: 
And I 
said to my heart —
it lion time is told, 
A 
mightier voice than that sexton's old 
Will sound &et:the last trump's dreadful din—
