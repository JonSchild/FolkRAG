HARRY RICHMOND'S 
MY YOUNG WIFE AND I 
SONGSTER. 
T
ilY YOUNG WIFE AND I. 
Written and sung with unbounded applause .by H ARRY Ricn-
MOND. 
Respectfully dedicated by him to Mn. and M RS. Joax 
A. 
K ELLY, New York. 
I 
MERRILY sing from morn till night, 
And misery I 
defy, 
And I've a 
wife who with delight, 
Sings just as happy as I. 
She is the comfort of my life, 
My darling and my pride, 
Midst weal and woe together, my boys, 
We've travell'd it side by side. 
CHORUS. 
Bound goes the wheel, 
Trouble I 
defy, 
Jogging along together, my boys, 
My dear young wife and I. 
When homeward I'm returning, 
She'll greet me with a 
smile, 
1.0 
SOPHIA, TUE PRETTY LITTLE LAUNDRESS. 
Her dear young face beams with delight, 
In such a 
happy style; 
" 
Sit down by the fireside," 
She'll say, " and take your tea." 
She laughs and jokes on Vother side, 
A 
picture, boys, to see. 
-Round goes the wheel, etc. 
In winter, when the snow is down, 
She'll meet me at the door, 
With " Come in lad and warm vourself, 
You must be cold I'm sure.' ; 
She brings my slippers, warm and dry, 
And lays them by my side; 
I 
never could find her equal, though 
I 
searched the world so wide. 
Round goes the wheel, etc. 
I 
smoke my pipe and sing my song, 
Content to stay at home, 
As happy as the day is long, 
And ne'er inclined to roam; 
There's many talk of single bliss, 
And for their freedom sigh, 
But that will never be the case, 
With my young wife and I. 
Round goes the wheel, etc. 
SOPHIA, THE PRETTY LITTLE LAUNDRESS. 
AIlt—" Pretty Little Sarah." 
Sung, localized, and introduced in America by Ilanny RICHMOND. 
A LITTLE while ago I 
took it in my head, 
That single I 
had long enough tarried; 
SOPHIA, THE PRETTY LITTLE LAUNDRESS. 
11 
For to mope up by one's self it's a 
little good, I 
said, 
So I 
will look a 
little sharp and get married; 
It was near 
met a 
buxom lass, 
Says I, " My pretty dear, where are you going so fast 7" 
I 
am going for some washing, so do not stop me pray, 
For I 
am a 
little laundress on my eighty cents a 
day." 
CHORUS. 
Now I've got a 
little home, and I've got a 
little wife, 
A 
pretty little girl named Sophia; 
Me and my little wife, we never have no strife, 
What more on earth can any man desire 7 
Says I, " My pretty little girl, do you feel inclined 
Me to accept for your lover" 
Says she, " If you'll prove kind, sir, I 
do not mind, 
But come with me and I 
will ask my mother." 
Without any delay, with her I 
went straightway. 
Her mother she consented, we named the wedding day; 
To me she is far dearer than any lady gay, 
My charming little laundress on her eighty cents a 
day. 
Now I've got a 
little home, etc. 
Then to church we did repair, a 
happy little pair ; 
She said " yes " without hesitation; 
Then home we went so gay, and spent a 
happy day, 
Surrounded by our friends and relations. 
And I 
bless the happy day I 
met her on the way, 
And from my pretty laundress I 
never mean to stray, 
So I'll do all I 
can to please her night and day, 
My pretty little laundress on her eighty cents a 
day. 
Now I've got a 
little home, etc. 
Now she has bought some little socks, she is making lit-
tle frocks, 
With little skirts no bigger than a 
minute, 
12 
on! SHOULDN'T I LIKE, OH MY ! 
She has bought a 
nice pap ladle, a 
little chair and cradle, 
And we expect a 
little baby to put in it; 
While she is washing at the tub, or hanging clothes to 
dry, 
The cradle I 
will rock, and sing sweet lullaby; 
Or perhaps I'll turn the mangle, but of that Pll nothing 
say 
To my charming little laundress on eighty cents per day. 
Now I've got a 
little home, etc. 
OH! SHOULDN'T I 
LIKE, OH; 111Y! 
Sung by H ARRY R ICHMOND with immense applause. 
THE other night at dark, I 
thought I'd take a 
gentle stroll, 
So down Broadway I 
went, in a 
sort of jaunting roll ; 
Gay carriages I 
gaz'd upon, with quite a 
longing eye, 
Then quietly remarked, " Oh! shouldn't I 
like, oh, my !" 
CHORUS. 
Oh! shouldn't I 
like, oh, my! upon my word it's true; 
I 
would I 
could, but if I 
can't how can I'? now, could 
you'? 
On my way by chance I 
met my wife, who quickly me 
did stop, 
And press'd me, like most ladies do, to visit the draper's 
shop ; 
I 
went just like a 
lamb, when a 
French hat she did spy; 
Says she, " You'll buy it dear 7 
Oh! shouldn't I 
like, oh, 
my!" 
Oh! shouldn't I 
like, etc. 
Then there's her pretty cousin, who on the piano plays, 
And with her angel voice will oft sing me some plaintive 
lays; 
Oil! SHOULDN 'T I LIKE, OH , MY ! 
And when she does, her looks are sweet, but when sho 
heaves a 
sigh 
To relieve her little heart, oh 
shouldn't I 
like, oh, my ! 
Oh! shouldn't I 
like, etc. 
A 
married lady friend oft visits my dear wife, 
But every time she calls, oh dear ! it's sure to cause me 
strife ; 
Because she has a 
pretty babe, and mine's got none; 
but why 
Should she blame it all to me'? oh! shouldn't I 
like oh, 
my! 
Oh! shouldn't I 
like, etc. 
At St. John's, Varick street, I 
went the other day, 
To see a 
couple married, and hear the bridegroom say, 
" 
I 
take you, miss, for wedded wife," when the bridesmaid 
gave a 
sigh, 
And look'd as if she wished to say, oh ! shouldn't I 
like, 
oh, my ! 
Oh! shouldn't I 
like, etc. 
At Barney Williams' Theatre I 
the other night did see 
Two ladies slyly take a 
glance in a 
box just vis-a-vis, 
I 
caught their looks, now strange to say, just as I 
raised 
my eye, 
They dropp'd their heads, and smiling said, " Oh! 
shouldn't I 
like, oh my ! 
Oh! shouldn't I 
like, etc. 
Now my motto's tempts fault, so I'll wish my friends 
" 
Good night," 
For to infringe on time too much, you'll say would not 
be right; 
But happy I 
shall be, when again your passing by, 
To try and please you one and all, oh ! shouldn't I 
like, 
oh my 
Oh ! shouldn't I 
like, etc.

res ASTONISHING HOW IT 1S DONE, 
ETC. 
IT'S ASTONISHING HOW IT IS DONE BUT IT IS. 
A IR—" Wonderful How They do it, But They Do." 
Localized and sung first in America by H ARRY RICHMOND. 
A 
CHAP to get along in this wide world of ours,. 
Must have his cranium screwed on the right way, 
And be one of those sort of chaps who always gets in 
debt, 
Then places trust in Providence to pay. 
With the business of all he must acquainted be, 
But never let a 
single soul know his; 
We always find those chaps can get along like•mad; 
It's astonishing how it is done, but it is. 
A 
fellow now possessed of three hundred dollars a 
year, 
Does oftener live up to five or six; 
lie cuts about like winking, in fine style does appear, 
While his creditors (poor devils) oft get nix ; 
But when the bubble bursts, they find they have chis-
elled been, 
And then they pull a 
rather lengthy phiz ; 
When ' tis too late they find they've all been had like 
lambs ; 
It's astonishing how it is done, but it is. 
My landlady last week brought a 
long bill to me, 
Demanding of me twenty-five weeks' rent, 
But I 
soft-soaped her over, and very soon could see 
My gammon caused her soft heart to relent; 
When I 
said her I'd wed, she believed all that I 
said, 
And little thought that her I 
meant to quiz ; 
She gave me a 
receipt in full, and then I 
cut my stick ; 
It's astonishing how it is done, but it is. 
Then Mrs. Betsy Brown, she's a 
buxom little wife, 
And tho' she's only just now in her prime, 
YOU'LL ItEMEiU.BIat ME. 
She has twenty little pledges, and has taken now of late 
To present Brown with three cherubs at a 
time; 
Brown often with an oath, says, " It's coming it too 
strong," 
And for such kindness doesn't thank his Liz, 
For three times in succession she has had three children 
at a 
birth ; 
It's astonishing how it is done, but it is. 
YOU'LL REMEMBER ME. 
New serio-eomic Song. 
Written and Sung by H ARRY RICHMOND. 
Now listen to a 
story sad, 
Of a 
gal I 
lov'd named May, 
My peace of mind was ne'er disturbed, 
Till a 
chap stepp'd in the way ; 
For she was as lovely as the morn, 
And she lived in Jersey, 
And I 
always thought, upon my life, 
That she'd remember me. 
One moonlight night, when the stars shone bright, 
Towards her home I 
stroll'd, 
When in the parlor nere I 
saw, 
The chap a 
sittin' bold; 
I 
sprang at once into the room, 
With rage could scarcely see, 
And as I 
punch'd him on the nose, 
I 
said ; " Now you'll remember me.". 
IIe called " Police !" the bobbies came, 
lie told them what I'd done, 
And then before a 
magistrate, 
Of course I 
had to come; 
BEAUTIFUL CUP OF GOOD TEA. 
The judge with one eye on his book, 
From me would take no fee, 
And as he sentenced me six months, 
lie said, " Now you'll remember me." 
BEAUTIFUL CUP OF GOOD TEA. 
Ara—" Beautiful Isle of the Sea." 
Respectfully dedicated to Jos. STINEU, the New York Tea Mer-
chant, by HARRY RICHMOND. 
BEAUTIFUL cup of good tea, 
Made with some boiling hot water, 
Dearer than all you're to me, 
If only made of the right sorter ; 
tiller's purest of black, 
Maketh the mouth well to quiver, 
And maketh the lips well to smack, 
Oh! from this tea I'll ne'er sever. 
CLIOROS . 
Fountain of pleasure untold, 
Beautiful cup of nice tea. 
Repeat. 
If you've been out on the spree, 
Nothing on earth's so refreshing, 
Beautiful cup of good tea, 
Surely to man you're a 
blessing; 
Headache and sickness soon fly 
Before a 
good cup of Bohea, 
Nothing on earth can outvie, 
A 
beautiful cup of good tea. 
Fountain of pleasure untold, 
Beautiful cup of good tea. 
Repeat. 
WATER-CRESSES. 
Sung with great success by HARRY RICHMOND. 
I 
AM a 
jolly farmer, from Bedfordshire I 
came, 
To see some friends at Harlem, and Morgan is my name, 
At .a 
dairy farm near Dunstable I 
live when I'm at home, 
And if I 
get safe back again, from there 
never roam ; 
But if you'll give attention I'll tell you without delay, '• 
how a 
buxom little damsel my affections led astray, 
And promised for to marry me upon the first of May, 
And left me with a 
bunch of water-cresses. 
'Twas On the first of April when I 
arrived in town, 
And being quite a 
stranger, I 
wandered up and down, 
Until I 
lost myself entirely, I 
cannot tell you where, 
But ' twas in a 
very quiet street, the corner of a 
square ; 
A neatly dressed young woman came walking down the 
way, 
As long as I 
remember, I 
shall ne'er forget the day, 
For she promised then to marry me upon the first of 
May, 
And she left me with a 
bunch of water-cresses. 
Politely I 
addressed her, and thus to her did say, 
" 
I 
wish to go to Harlem, can you direct the way 3 " 
" 
Oh, yes, sir! oh, yes, sir I " she speedily replied," 
" 
Take the turning on the left, then go down the other 
side ;" 
Her voice it was the sweetest I 
ever yet did bear, 
in her bands—which like the lily—were so very white 
and clear, 
She'd a 
bunch of early onions, a 
pint of lager- beer, 
Some pickles, and a 
bunch of water-cresses. 
I 
bow'd and I 
thanked her, and walk'd by her side, 
And thought how well she'd look as a 
dairy farmer's 
bride ; 
18 
THE CONSTANTINOPLE COUNTESS. 
I 
gathered resolution, half in earnest, half in joke, 
I 
hinted matrimony, these very words I 
spoke : 
" 
I've a 
farm of forty acres, I've horses, cows and geese, 
Besides I 
have a 
dairy filled with butter, milk and cheese, 
Will you marry me, and mistress be, fair lady, of all these'? 
And we'll pass our days on love and water-cresses." , 
She replied with a 
smile ( or a 
leer if you choose), 
" 
You are so very generous I 
cannot well refuse, 
So give me your direction, and I 
will without delay 
Prepare for matrimony, to love, honor, and obey; 
I've a 
wedding dress to buy, and some little bills to pay?' 
I 
handed her my pocket-book, expenses to defray, 
And she promised for to marry me upon the first of 
May, 
When she left me with a 
bunch of water-cresses. 
Next day a 
letter I 
received, and read there with surprise, 
" 
Dear sir, for disappointing you I 
must apologize, 
But when next you ask a 
stranger into partnership for 
life, 
Be sure she is a 
maiden, or a 
widow, not a 
wife; 
I've a 
husband of my own, and his name is Willie Grey, 
And when I 
oan afford it the money I'll repay ; 
To think that I 
should marry you upon the first of May, 
Why, you must have been as green as water-cresses. 
THE CONSTANTINOPLE COUNTESS. 
Sung by HAnny RICHMOND with unbounded applause. 
My friends, your sympathy bestow, 
On this poor man before you, 
And hear his tale so full of woe, 
And ' tisn't long he'll bore you ; 
TUE CONSTANTINOPLE COUNTESS. 
To this sad plight he's now reduced, 
Though once he felt ambition's fame, 
For once he lov'd a 
Countess, who 
From the Turkish country tame 
Constantinople, Constantinople, 
Constantinople that Countess came.

I 
only was a

But I 
lived middling well tho', 
I 
met her in the Central Park, 
her name I 
wished as well, so 
I 
soon found out the lady's maid, 
And thus did quickly ascertain, 
The lady was a 
Countess, who 
From the Turkish country came, 
Constantinople, Constantinople, 
Constantinople that Countess came. 
C 0 N 
and a 
Con, etc. 
I 
met my charmer at the ball, 
And forthwith was presented, 
And down before her •I did fall, 
(A scheme long since invented), 
I 
swore like any German prince 
That Countess should bear my name, 
And accepted I 
was by that Countess, who 
From the Turkish country came,

THE CONSTANTINOPLE COUNTESS . 
Now there was a 
girl called Betty Buck, 
Who I 
was long engaged to, 
She very soon gave me the " sack," 
And was very much enraged too; 
She said she'd heard such tales of me, 
And knew full well my little " game" 
Was to marry this Countess, who 
From the Turkish country came; 
Constantinople, Constantinople, 
Constantinople that Countess came. 
C 0 N with a 
Con, etc. 
I 
spent and squandered all my cash 
To gain her approbation, 
For the Contess she cut such a 
dash 
She was far above my station; 
I 
found out what a 
rogue she was, 
And not a 
stranger to that game; 
I 
was done " brown " by that Countess, who 
From the Turkish country came ; 
Constantinople, Constantinople, 
Constantinople that Countess came. 
C 0 N with a 
Con, etc. 
So now you see how I've been served, 
Through one so much above me, 
Though the punishment I 
have deserved, 
And no one else will love me; 
Oh ! what a 
happy man I'd been, 
Had Betty Buck but took my name, 
And I'd ne'er seen that Countess, who 
From the Turkish country came; 
Constantinople, Constantinople, 
Constantinople that Countess came.

DARE-DEVIL DICK. 
Sung with great applause by H ARRY R ICHMOND. 
DANcrNo swells and Bohemians, you have all seen 
" 
Champagne Charlie " who drinks till the morning ; 
But just like the lions that appear in the square, 
I 
come without giving much warning ; 
I'm void of all care, policemen I 
dare, 
If in trouble I 
get my defence is— 
I 
say I'm a 
gent, show my purse, tip the wink, 
And get off by paying expenses. 
CHO RUS . 
l'm dare- devil Dick, I'm dare-devil Dick, 
Frolic and fun is my game, boys, 
A 
jolly young brick, always up to a 
trick, 
Yes ! dare-devil Dick is my name, ha! ha! 
A 
select private concert I 
went to last night, 
Such a 
meeting I 
never saw better ; 
So to have some good sport I 
thought I 
would get 
An ounce of cayenne pepper, 
With my Havanna cigar the pepper I 
burnt, 
Which I, scatter'd about, oh! ' twas pleasing, 
For the beautiful chorus that was then being sung, 
Soon alter'd from singing to sneezing. 
I'm dare-devil Dick, etc. 
Tho' I'm gay, and in mischief I 
revel, I 
own, 
I've a 
heart that is tender and willing ; 
I'm always the first to help any one poor, 
if I'd only a 
pound or a 
shilling ; 
If in 
nature is rough one maxim I 
hold, 
And my sentiments to you uncover ; 
It's not words but deeds we expect from a 
man, 
It's the " heart that can feel for another. ' 
I'm dare-devil Dick, etc.

It's not my wife, upon my life, 
But a 
rattling old bay mare. 
CHORUS. 
Round goes the world, 
Trouble I 
defy , • 
Jogging along together, my boys, 
My rattling mare and I. 
Up and down the country side, 
The mare and I 
we go, 
The folks they kindly greet us, 
As we journey to and fro; 
The little ones they cheer us, 
And the old ones stop and stare, 
And lift their eyes with great surprise, 
At Joe and his rattling mare. 
Round goes the world, etc. 
And when the roads aro heavy, 
Or travelling up hill, 
I'm by her side assisting her, 
She works with such good will ; 
I 
know she loves me well enough, 
Because the whip I 
spare, 
SUSAN'S SUNDAY OUT.

I'd rather hurt myself than hurt 
My rattling old bay mare. 
Round goes the world, etc. 
And when the town we reach, 
She rattles over the stones, 
She lifts her hoofs up splendidly, 
Not one of your lazy drones; 
It's, " Clear the road," when Joseph comes, 
"My crawlers all take care 
Of the carrier's cart, the driver smart, 
And the rattling old bay mare. 
Round goes the world, etc. 
I 
would not change my station 
With the noblest in the land ; 
I 
would not be Prime Minister, 
Or anything so grand; 
I 
would not be an alderman, 
To live in luxury 
And state, if it would separate, 
The old bay mare and I. 
Round goes the world, etc.

Oil ! shan't I 
be delighted just, when Sunday comes, I 
know, 
I 
wish it would make haste and come, it is so precious

No doubt you all desire to know what ' tis really all about, 
The fact is, that next Sunday his Susan's Sunday out.

SUSAN'S SUNDAY OUT. 
CHORUS. 
Oh ! gemini crikey, blow me tight, I 
always dance and 
shout, 
It fills my heart with great delight, when it's Susan's 
Sunday out. 
She must have lots of " perkersites," she gives me joints 
of meat, 
Tho' sometimes in the summer time they are not over 
sweet; 
She keeps me well in " pannum," that's what makes me 
look so stout, 
And don't I 
just blow out my kite on Susan's Sunday 
out. 
Oh, gemini, etc. 
My Susan is a scullery-maid, she lives in Washington 
Square, 
She's eyes like sloes, a 
turn-up nose, and a 
carrotty head 
of hair ; 
She's often taken for a 
queen, as with me she walks 
about, 
And I 
alters feel so happy when it's Susan's Sunday out. 
Oh ! gemini, etc. 
And all the loose tobacco she finds in the empty jars, 
She gives to me, and oftentimes a 
bundle of cigars ; 
She says they are her " perkersites," which in course I 
doesn't doubt, 
And I 
always wish that oftener ' twas Susan's Sunday out. 
Oh! gemini etc. 
Her " perkersites " extends to clothes, for she gives me 
slap-up suits— 
Coats, trousers, hats, and vests, umbrellas, shirts, and 
boots; 
CLEMENTINA CAMS. 
Says she, " Master, he can't wear 'em now, acos he's got 
so stout, 
He guy 'em to me, to guy to you, on my next Sunday 
out." 
Oh! gemini, etc. 
Her missus and the young uns are often out of town, 
Then I goes into the kitchen, and to tea with her sits 
down ; 
Her master he can't come down stairs, he's always got 
the gout, 
And sometimes two or three times a 
week it's Susan's 
Sunday out. 
Oh! gemini, etc. 
She's got an eye to business, she already is beginning 
To be prepared for a 
rainy day with lots of baby linen ; 
She says 
it 
might be wanted—that it will I do not 
doubt— 
For married we intend to be on her next Sunday out. 
Oh! gemini, etc.

Sweet Miss Clemmy Caults, 
Night and day she pines away, 
For the awful Mabel Waltz. 
One day I 
took her out to dine, 
And thought to do the grand ; 
Just as we began to eat, 
There came a 
German band; 
Soon as they began to blow, 
Up jump'd Miss Clemmy Caults, 
Upsetting the table and the guests— 
She danc'd the Mabel Waltz.

Her head did ache, old Doctor Jake 
Prescrib'd some scented salts ; 
But she rusli'd into a 
druggist's shop 
For a 
bottle of Mabel Waltz. 
Should a 
policeman complain, 
And tell her of her faults, 
She'll seize him round the waist and make 
Him dance the Mabel Waltz.

The Mabel Waltz, the Mabel Waltz, 
From morning, noon till night, 
She'd dance that tune until I

She'd drive me mad outright. 
If she ever dies, I

The ghost of Clemmy Caults 
Will pull me out of bed some night 
To dance the Mabel Waltz.

As adoring, before her I

But when she chopp'd mincemeat for Christmas time, 
What tranquil enjoyment I 
felt.

Indulge in this whistling whim 7 
He looked down the area at my Polly Ann, 
And Polly Ann look'd up at him. 
While her mincemeat-knife, etc. 
My love and good luck were alike on the wane, 
For the bagatelle man from this time began

Stamp, stamp, stamp, my wife is stamping, 
Blowing up and nagging all the day; 
Throws the first thing at my head, curtain lecture when 
in bed, 
She's the devil if she can't have her own way. 
In the morning when I 
rise, like a 
cat she at me flies, 
And swears she has had no sleep all the night; 
In the bed she then turns o'er and so loudly she will 
snore, 
And if I 
wake her there is sure to be a 
fight.

And while she's at her ease, I

Or with them to the public-houses go.

I STAND before you bath'd in tears,

I 
once was fat, but now I'm thin, 
Without the aid of Banting; 
The reason is, I've lost my love, 
No damsel could be fairer, 
her fighting weight was thirteen stone,

CHORUS . 
She went away a 
month to-day, 
her absence grieves me greatly, 
She'd a 
strawberry mark upon her arm, 
Oh! have you seen her lately 
She's cheeks like lilies, eyes like sloes, 
And fingers long and taper, 
Her hair is red to match her nose, 
And mostly worn in paper ; 
I 
cannot guess, upon my life, 
What she has gone away for, 
She's taken every stick away, 
That I 
have had to pay for.

More than any land I've seen. 
And I

Poor Pat is often painted 
With a

Let slanderers say what they will, 
They cannot call him mean, 
Sure a

Good for any game at cards, my boys, 
Who'll come and try their luck with me 1

I

At coffee and at supper rooms, I

At cribbage too, there's very few who luck from me can

And he who's game to peg away, soon gets one for his 
nob. 
For High Low Jacky, etc. 
Some gamesters try for little gains, and other play for 
love, 
Tho' hearts are mostly trumps they say, such manners I'm

To win bank notes and dollar-points, I 
know a 
trick or 
two. 
For High Low Jacky, etc. 
But tho' I 
never play for love, I 
suffer from its smarts, 
And some day, perhaps, as king of trumps, I'll wed a 
queen of hearts;

For they'll soon see that I

As

Air.—" Doran's Ass." 
AT 
the outlets of our city lives 
A widow woman, Mrs. Keough, 
Who, to gosther, as most women did, 
To neighbors' houses she did not go. 
No china plate or useless worth 
Bedecked her neat, but humble cot, 
THE STIRABOUT POT. 
And her principal bit of futniture 
Was a 
ducky little stirabout pot. 
A widow's life she led, altho' 
She couldn't escape from scandal's tongue; 
'Twas soon found out she had a 
beau, 
A boy who in a 
tavern sung. 
Some say she had a 
tidy purse— 
I 
can't say say whether she had or not; 
But every time Jack call'd on her, 
She found his eye was in the pot.. 
At grub time he ne'er failed to come 
When the oatmeal it was smoking hot; 
And to all her questions he was dumb, 
Unless she talk'd about the pot. 
He'd seat himself beside the bob, 
While she filled the dishes boiling hot; 
And, till they cool'd, he amused, his gob 
By bolting all left in the pot. 
He kept working on this hungry dodge, 
Till the widow found it would not wash ; 
So she thought ' twas time for him to trudge, 
Saying, " It isn't myself the fellow wants." 
Says she one day ( for she was a 
wag), 
" 
You think you've a 
mighty warm spot; 
But the meal is out, so take the bag." 
Says he, " Devil a 
toe without the pot." 
She thought it cheaper to give it, than 
To give the scamp two meals each day— 
And he was scorched by the summer's sun, 
As to his lodgings he made his way ; 
lie felt he had an awkward load, 
And often wished at home the lot; 
So to make it easy on the road, 
Like a 
helmet he stuck on the pot.

PARODY ON PADDY'S WEDDING. 
He was going along the turnpike road, 
Proud as a 
sNteep in Sunday clothes, 
When stepping over a 
heap of mud, 
The pot slipp'd down below his nose. 
To raise it up in vain he tried— 
The more he hooshed, it tighter got; 
So down he sat and loudly cried, 
" 
Oh, my cod's head's stewing in her pot." 
'Twas lucky the widow followed Jack 
To see what he was going to do; 
For some ehilder seeing him on his back, 
Began to pelt the buggaboo. 
Tie shouted, " Save me, widow dear," 
When a 
lump of paving- stone she got, 
And bate it till she split his ear, 
That split their friendship and the pot.

Though through your neglect I 
have sadly been tried, 
Yet my husband to me is still dear.

I AM A DOWNY BIRD . 
How happy would I 
be, 
• Carolling all the day, 
If only blest with thee, 
Beguiling time away ; 
Then life would be a 
pleasure, 
My mind would be at rest, 
If with my only treasure 
This heart was ever blest.

Oh would I

That I

And breathe a 
loving word, 
To one so dear to Inc. 
Oh would that I 
could fly, 
This bright and glorious day, 
To breathe out sigh for sigh, 
To thee so far away; 
My heart would beat with joy, 
To see thee once again, 
Thy sorrows to allay, 
For cherish'd is thy name. 
And when the moon is beaming, 
O'er distant grove and lea, 
And joyous stars are gleaming, 
Then would I 
were with thee.

I AM A DOWNY BIRD . 
I 
once was spoonified, 
For which I've had to pay, 
But now awake I'm wide, 
And know the time o' day; 
By dodgers I've been swindled, 
And sharps my tin did touch, 
Now to be sold or " fiddled" 
This covey knows too much. 
CHORUS. 
I 
am a 
downy bird, 
No green in me they see, 
I'm up to every word, 
And chaff wont do for me. 
I've been out on the spree, 
And played out all next day, 
Then wanted strong Bohea 
To take the pain away ; 
Expended my last cent 
111 a 
coach to drive, 
And spouted my top coat 
To keep the game alive. 
I've shouted, " Where's Eliza 7" 
And gone on anyhow ; 
But experience makes fools wiser, 
1 
shouldn't do it now. 
I

And wouldn't " shoot the moon," 
To pay it been content, 
Oh, wasn't I

To trust one time of life 
In good friends I 
was led ; 
Till one sloped with my wife 
Then all my greenness fled ;

I'll leave the rose for the green little shamrock,

I've been dejected, forsaken and forlorn.

And pleasant for to see the meadows green and gay ; 
And the frisky bonny Irish boys so fondly will be courting, 
So cheerful and light-hearted on St. Patrick's day.

Though, to travel near and far, 
The fattest mare you'll find, belongs 
To Pat of Mullingar.

She can trot along, jog along, 
Drag a

No day's too long, when set aiong 
With Pat of Mullingar. 
She was bred in Connemara, 
And brought up at Castlernaine ; 
PAT OF muLLINGAR. 
She won cups at the Currah, 
The finest baste on all the plain! 
All countries and conveyances 
She has been buckled to; 
She lost an eye at Limerick, 
And an ear at Waterloo. 
She can trot along,. etc. 
If a

I'll go wherever you want ; 
I'll drive you out of your mind, sir,

You'll ride behind the little mare 
Of Pat of Mullin,gar.

It's all the same to me ; 
To Donnybrook, whose ancient fair 
Is famed for love and war ; 
Or if you have the time to spare, 
Well go to Mulling,ar. 
She can trot along, etc. 
When on the road we're going, 
The other carmen try 
(Without the darling knowing) 
To pass her on the sly. 
Her one ear points up to the sky, 
She tucks her haunches in ; 
Then shows the lads how she can fly, 
As I 
sit still and grin ! 
She can trot along, etc.

HARDING, with immense ElleCOSS. 
Music at BRENTON and COREY'S, 49 Sixth Avenue, New York. 
I'vE roamed for many a 
lengthened mile 
Upon the stormy seas; 
I've seen full many a 
banner float 
So proudly on the breeze ; 
That standard, too, Great Britain's pride, 
The boast of England's tars; 
But none could thrill my heart like thee, 
My country's flag of stars. 
Brazil's gay flag of gorgeous dyes, 
The banner of old Spain; 
E'en Gallia's bunting as it flies 
Is not undimmed by stain ; 
Their lustre has been sullied oft 
At home by deadly jars, 
But thy bright azure folds are pure, 
My country's flag of stars. 
In some famed foreign port I've seen 
The ships of half the world,

SHELLING GREEN PEAS. 
To celebrate some gala day, 
Their bunting all unfurled ; 
With eager gaze I 
bent my eyes 
Along their tapering spars, 
Until 1. saw thy flowing folds, 
My country's flag of stars. 
And as thy striped and star-specked field 
Broke on my eager sight, 
My heart beat strong, my bosom thrilled 
With unalloyed delight. 
I 
hailed thee as the cynosure 
Of true Columbian tars, 
Thou banner of the brave and free, 
My country's flag of stars. 
SHELLING GREEN PEAS. 
Firvt sung in America by H ARRY R ICHMOND, with tremendous 
applause. 
I 
SING you a 
ditty, of damsel so pretty, 
Who liv'd from the city some seventeen miles ; 
Iler name is Maria, her worthy old sire 
Was clerk and town crier—his name was John Styles. 
With lips like the cherry, a 
smile, too, so merry, 
I 
thought her the very one suited to please, 
And when I 
first met her, and tried hard to get her, 
For worse or for better, she was shelling green peas. 
CHORUS. 
Under the trees, a 
bowl on her knees, 
Maria sat silently shelling green peas. 
II long lov'd her dearly, truly, sincerely, 
At length I 
thought, really, I'd settle in life ; 
SHELLING GREEN PEAS. 
Although aged fifty, I'd been very thrifty, 
And thought ' twas high time to be taking a 
wife. 
With bosom on fire, in search of Maria, 
Thro' lanes of wild-brier, o'er-shadow'd by trees ; 
I 
stroll'd to the spot where, outside her cot there, 
She was sitting so patiently shelling green peas. 
Under the trees, etc. 
I 
step up unto her, commencing to woo her, 
I 
said, " That no truer fond heart could be found 
Than mine, if she'd take me some morning, and make me 
The happiest mortal for twenty miles round." 
I 
said, " Our life might be one round of delight, 
Like the little birds singing upon the green trees." 
To a 
whisper than dropping my voice, without stopping, 
The question was popping, as she popped the peas. 
Under the trees, etc. 
No answer she made, and I 
was much afraid 
That this beautiful maid had not heard all I 
said. 
At her feet kneeling, I 
tried to be stealing 
A kiss—when came reeling her hand. on my head ; 
" 
Do you think I'd engage," she cried out, in a 
rage, 
" 
With a 
man twice my age, so clear out if you please." 
In a 
terrible passion, at me she sent crashing, 
On my head smashing, the bowl of green peas." 
Under the trees, etc. 
By way of addenda, she said, " Sir, remember 
That May and December can never unite, 
Your leave, sir, be taking," my neck nearly breaking, 
I 
made my escape in a 
terrible fright.

By shouting out after me, " Lamb and green peas." 
THE ROCKY ROAD TO DUBLIN. 
As sung by HARRY RICHMOND and ThautY M ERRITT. 
IN 
the merry month of June, 
From my home I 
started, 
Left the girls of Tuam, 
Nearly broken hearted; 
Saluted father dear, 
Kiss'd my darling mother, 
Drank a 
pint of beer, 
My grief and tears to smother; 
Then off to reap the corn, 
And leave where I 
was born, 
1 
cut a 
stout black thorn, 
To banish a 
ghost or goblin. 
In a 
bran new pair of brogues, 
I 
rattled over the bogs, 
And frightened all the dogs, 
On the Rocky Road to Dublin. 
CHORUS. 
Whack-fal-lal-le-ral, 
Whack-fal-lal-le-ral, 
Whack-fal-lal-le, 
Whack-fal-lal-le-rido. 
In Mulling,er that night, 
I 
rested limbs so weary, 
Started by daylight, 
Next morning light and airy; 
Took a 
drop o' the pure, 
To keep my spirits from sinking, 
THE ROCKY ROAD TO DUBLIN. 
That's an Irishman's cure, 
Whenever he's on for drinking. 
To see the lasses smile, 
Laughing all the while, 
At my curious style, 
'Twould set your heart a 
bubblin'. 
They ax'd me if I 
was hired, 
The wages I 
required, 
Till I 
was almost tired, 
Of the Rocky Road to Dublin. 
Whack-fal, etc. 
In Dublin next arrived, 
1 
thought it such a 
pity, 
To be so soon deprived, 
A view of that fine city; 
Then I 
took a 
stroll, 
All among the quality, 
My bundle it was stole, 
In a 
neat locality. 
Something crossed my mind, 
Then I 
looked behind. 
No bundle could I 
find, 
Upon my stick a 
wobblin'. 
Inquiring for the rogue, 
They said my Connaught brogue, 
Wasn't much in vogue, 
On the Rocky Road to Dublin. 
Whack-fal, etc. 
From there I 
got away, 
My spirits never failin', 
Landed on the quay, 
As the ship was sailin'. 
Captain at me roared, 
Said that no room had he, 
When 1 
juniped aboard, 
A cabin found for Paddy.

TILE WATERFORD BOYS . 
Down among the pigs, 
I 
played some funny rigs, 
Danced some hearty jigs, 
The water round me bubblin', 
When off Holyhead, 
I 
wished myself was dead, 
Or better far instead, 
On the Rocky Road to Dublin, 
Whack-fal, etc. 
The boys of Liverpool, 
When we safely landed, 
Called myself a 
fool, 
I 
could no longer stand it.

They joined in tile affray,

For the Rocky Road to Dublin.

Sung by Tom N OLAN, of Brooklyn, with great applause. 
W ELL, boys, for divarsion we've all met togc,ther, 
I'll tell you how from Waterford hither I 
came ; 
I 
cross'd the big ocean in dark gloomy weather, 
My heart it was light and my pockets the same. 
THE WSTERFOUD BOYS . 
Sad at la\ing oul' Ireland, but once more on dry land, 
By the road- side a 
tavern I 
happened to spy ; 
And as I 
was meltin' my pockets I 
felt in 
The price of a 
drink, I 
was mortally dry.

CHORUS . 
For we are the boys of fun, wit and element, 
Drinking and dancing and all other joys, 
For ructions, destruction divarsion and devilment 
Who can compare with the Waterford boys. 
In the tavern I 
strolled, out the master he rolled, 
'Morrow, sez he, sez I, av ye please, 
Provide me a 
bed, but first bring me some bread, 
A 
bottle of porter and small piece of cheese. 
For tunes they are queer, and provisions are dear, 
If you cannot get meat with cheese be content; 
Sez the landlord, " You're right," so he brought me the 
bite, 
I 
roll'd up my cuffs and at it I 
went. 
For we are th6 boys, etc. 
My bread and cheese ended, I 
then condescended, 
To seek some repoSe, so I'ax'd for a

And soon in a 
doze I 
was under the clothes, 
I 
popp'd in my toes, and I 
popp'd out the light : 
But ' akin' from sleepin' I 
heard something creepin', 
Meanderin' and wanderin' about my bed- post, 
Squeakin' and scratchin', thinks I 
mid my watchin' 
'Pon my conscience you've mighty long claws for a

wish they would lave me, 
They ruin my trade, and I'm not worth a

Agreed, then sez I, to supper invite them,

CHORUS . 
Oh, petty Jemima, don't say no, 
Oh, hi oh! don't say 110 
Pretty Janina, don't say no, 
And we will married be. 
I 
once was afraid to speak outright; 
I 
was so shy I 
feared to try: 
The thought of it put me all in a 
fright, 
So I'd grizzle and pine all day. 
I 
was getting thin as a 
scaffold pole, 
My buttons all fell away. 
And just because I 
hadn't the nerve 
To pluck up courage and say, . 
Oh ! pretty Jemima, etc. 
We went for a 
walk not long ago; 
Thinks I, somehow, 1'11 tell her now ; 
I 
just was going to let her know, 
When she spied a 
milliner's shop ; 
A 
hat and leathers was there for sale, 
I 
couldn't do less than stop, 
By the time I 
had bought it my courage had gone, 
And I 
couldn't the question pop. 
Oh! pretty Jemima, etc. 
At last one morning I 
bought the ring, 
And hit on a 
plan to make me a 
man; 
Thinks I 
to myself, this is the thing, 
This night shall cast the die. 
I 
held it up ; look ye here, I 
said, 
The moment it caught her eye, 
66 
THE HOUSE ON FIRE. 
Her lovely cheeks were suffused with red, 
And seeing no one was by, I 
said, 
Oh! pretty Jemima, etc. 
Of course I 
was anxious to know my fate, 
I 
almost dread the words I 
said; 
Whether to be with joy elate, 
Or be the most wretched of men. 
She tried it on her finger and said, 
'Twas a 
little too large, but then 
I 
coul I 
buy a 
keeper, and we'd get wed, 
Next Saturday morning at ten.

HOUSE ON FIRE. 
Sung by J. H. KELLy. 
Ara—" The Ship on Fire." 
'Trs the dead of the night— there's a 
glare in the sky ! 
A 
sound, an alarm, on the wind sweepeth by— 
'Tis the fire- bell that's ringing, it strikes on the ear; 
Oh, God ! what, a 
sound and at midnight to hear, 
Fire ! fire ! up, follow, it might be to save, 
To rescue a 
soul from a 
horrible grave. 
Just Heaven, see the flames, how they sparkle and leap, 
As a 
bark in the gale dashes over the deep; 
Now a 
cracking, now roaring, oh, terrible sight ! 
And our fear-stricken faces glare red in the light, 
The hot molten lead falls like rain on the ground, 
ITo ! 
water ! Ito waterl—there's none to be found. 
There was mirth in that house, till the close of the day, 
For the tables were spread and the guests they were gay, 
MILK- CAR. 
They were keeping the birthday, (oh glad was the bride) 
Of the youngest, the fairest, who slept by their side ; 
And the husband thrice happy, he breathed out a 
pray'r 
For his wife and his child who lay slumbering there. 
The sleepers are wakened—a 
shriek of despair, 
Already the fire is ascending the air ; 
Through smoke and through flame, in the wildest alarm, 
The husband leaped down with his wife on his arm ; 
But the young mother's struggles all frantic and wild, 
Oh husband! God speed thee, my child, save my child. 
Back, back like an arrow he flew through the flame, 
The stairs broke beneath him, but he overcame; 
A 
ladder ! a 
ladder ! the window is pass'd ; 
Thank God, too, there's water, there's water at last ; 
And the fears of the mother, her agony wild. 
Are amply repaid in the life of her child.

There she met young Bill, the milkman's son, 
Riding in the old milk- car. 
Now Bill he lived at the bottom of the hill, 
And Polly she lived with her ma, 
'Twas going to the mill when she met young Bill 
Riding in the old milk-car. 
'Twas going, etc. 
They met every morn for about six months, 
Which clearly proved this 'ere, 
PADDY MILES. 
That Polly Basinet was dearly beloved 
By the chap in the old milk- car. 
So one fine morn Bill made up his mind, 
The question to pop to his dear; 
And the very next day he did that same, 
While riding in the old milk- car. 
While riding, etc. 
Polly smiled and said, " My dearest Bill, 
If you will but prove true, 
I'll not say nay, but some fine day . 
Of course 1'11 marry you." 
So Bill and Polly they've got wed, 
And happy now they are, 
And Polly, now a

PADDY MILES. 
Sung with great applause by Tom NoLAN, of Brooklyn. 
FROM the big town of Limerick lately I 
came, 
I 
left Ireland solely bekase of my name, 
For if anything wint wrong, or a 
mischief ' twas done, 
Shure they'd have all the blame on my mother's own son. 
PADDY MILES. 
So my name now is Paddy O'Connor; 
'Pon an Irishman's thrue word an' honor, 
Oh, misfortune, my curse light upon her, 
'Twas she christened me Paddy Miles. 
If a 
windy was broke, or a 
house robbed of tiles, 
And you'd ax who done that, shure they say Paddy Miles. 
Who was it set fire to his reverence's wig '1 
And cut the tail of Pat Flanigan's pig'1 
Who called Mishes Muloney a 
scollop 1 
And gave Biddy McGee's cat the jallop 7 
Some blackguards would hit me a 
wollop, 
And say it was you, Paddy Miles.. 
I 
worked in the bogs and behaved as I 
thought, 
From my Master, Mick Flynn, a 
character I 
brought, 
But it done me no good and I 
thought that was odd, 
So I 
made up my mind for to leave the ould sod, 
For the devil a 
wan would employ me, 
The girls there they would annoy me, 
They threatened at once to destroy me, 
All bekase I 
was called Paddy Miles. 
Who cut off one of the tails of Pat Finegan's coat 
And who broke the left horn of Ned Shoughnessy's goat 7 
Who through the back door to the chapel got in 7 
And drank all the wine, blood and ounds, what a 
sin, 
Who half murdered a 
poor house inspector 7 
And fired at a 
police detecter ? 
When Miss Fagan they tried to eject her, 
Who was it, but you, Paddy Miles 
I 
trotted to Dublin to look for a 
place, 
Tho' they'd ne'er saw me there, faix, they all knew my 
face, 
The Jackeens kept calling meself to annoy, 
There goes Paddy Miles, he's a 
Limerick boy,

GOD IS WITH THE RIGHT. 
Then I 
flourished my sprig of shillely, 
An' smattered their gobs so genteelly, 
When the blood it began to flow freely, 
Said I, " How do you like Paddy Miles 7 " 
In short, before long., to this country I 
came,

COLUMBIA! land of Freedom's birth, 
On many a 
battle plain. 
Thy sons have crushed the foe to earth— 
It shall be so again. 
For when foul treason rears its head, 
And dares assert its right, 
Its cohorts yet shall learn to dread 
The Northruen in their right.

To arms we fly, and this the cry 
Shall nerve us in the fight, 
Our cause is just, succeed we must, 
For God is with the right. 
JUDGE NOT A MAN BY HIS CLOTHING. 
Tho' rebel hosts have dared to crave 
Dominion o'er the seas, 
Our star-specked flag alone shall wave 
Triumphant in the breeze. 
A million patriot swords are drawn, 
And scabbards cast aside, 
To battle for the Union sworn, 
For which our fathers died.

Arouse at duty's call, 
Our Constitution to uphold 
And by it stand or fall.

Columbia free once more shall be 
A beacon to the world.

JUDGE NOT A MAN BY HIS CLOTRING. 
Respectfully dedicated to Mr. LEWIS McLEtsH, of New Yorl:. 
Sung with great applause by H ARRY RICHMOND. 
Music at BURNTON & 
COREY'S 49 Sixth Avenue, N. Y. 
JUDGE not a 
man by the cost of his clothing, 
Unheeding the life-path that he my pursue ; 
Or oft you'll admire a 
heart that needs loathing, 
And fail to give honor where honor is due. 
The palm may be hard and the fingers stiffjointed, 
The coat may be tattered, the cheek worn with 
tears, 
But greater than kings are Labor's anointed, 
You can't judge a 
man by the coat that he wears. 
Give me the man as a 
friend and a 
neighbor, 
Who toils at the loom with the spade or the plough, 
62 
NOBODY'S CHILD. 
Who wins his diploma of manhood by labor, 
And purchases wealth by the sweat of his brow. 
Why should the broadcloth alone be respected, 
And the man be despised who in fustian appears 7 
While the angels in heaven have their limbs unprotected, 
You can't judge a 
man by the coat that he wears. 
.3 Age of a 
man by the work he is doing, 
Speak of a 
man as his actions demand ; 
Watch well the path that each is pursuing, 
And let the most worthy be chief of the land I 
And that man shall be found ' mid the close ranks of 
labor, 
Be known by the work that his industry rears, 
And the chiefdom when won shall be dear to his neigh-
bor, 
And we'll honor the man whatever he wears. 
NOBODY'S CHILD. 
As first sung in America by IIAREY BacnmoND, with immense 
applause. 
W HEREVER I 
was born and bred 
I 
really can't make out, 
And whether I 
was born at all 
The;e seems to be a 
doubt; 
And though I 
wish to be myself, 
It makes me very tiled, 
To find that I 
am some one else— 
In fact, " Nobody's child." 
CHORUS. 
I 
never had a 
father. 
I 
never had a 
mother, 
NOBODY 'S CHILD. 
I'm " Nobody's child." 
I 
tnever had a 
sister, 
I 
never had a 
brother, 
' 
In fact, I'm " Nobody's child." 
They found me 'neath a 
gooseberry bush 
At tender age of three, 
I 
don't belong to nobody, 
Yet he belongs to me; 
Some horrid blunder has been made 
By somebody or other, 
And I 
am not myself at all, 
But some one else's brother. 
I 
never had a 
father, etc. 
If I 
was anybody's son, 
My father he would be, 
And if he had a 
son, why what 
Relation's he to me 7 
Supposing SHE'S my brother's aunt 
The muddle to increase, 
Why then that makes me out to be 
My uncle's sister's niece. 
I 
never had a 
father, etc. 
Who's child am I 
7 
why nobody's, 
Whatever shall I 
do 7 
If I 
belong to nobody 
Let me belong to you, 
Kind ladies and good gentle folks 
Who on my suit have smiled, 
Give me your hands and your applause 
For I'm " Nobody's child." 
I 
never had a 
father, etc.

THE NOISY SWELL. 
THE 
NOISY SW ELL. 
Sung by HARRY RICHMOND. 
YOU'VE heard about the " languid swell," 
A fellow always quiet, 
I'm not like him, as you can tell, 
For / like noise and riot; 
I 
don't believe in quietude, 
'Tis not one of my joys ; 
So ladies, pray don't think me rude, 
When I 
say I 
love a 
noise. 
CHORUS. 
Slap, dash ! Jet's make a 
noise, 
Come along, boys, ets make a 
noise, 
Slap, dash ! let's make a 
noise. 
For I'm the noisy swell. 
Yes, when I 
was a 
little child— 
I 
was consider'd knowing, 
And all proclahn'd me " awful wild," 
Before I'd half done growing; 
To quiet me, it was no use 
To give me sweets and toys, 
So in despair they let me loose, 
To indulge in ev'ry noise. 
Slap, dash! etc. 
They said, as up in years I 
grew, 
My spirits would grow milder, 
But, to confess the truth to you, 
I 
think I've grown much wilder; 
I've started a 
fast " jolly school," 
It's members are " nice boys," 
They're all like me, not one a 
fool, 
Tho' we're A 
1 at a 
noise. 
Slap, dash! etc. 
' 
THE MUSICAL PARTY. 
We go to op'ras, routs, and balls, 
Find lots of fun before us, 
But our delight is music halls 
Where we join in each chorus; 
Indulging in the fragrant weed, 
Each one himself enjoys, 
The merry band / always lead, 
When we want an extra noise. 
Slap, dash! etc. 
So come and join our motley throng, 
You'll be delighted, very, 
For we're a 
school that ne'er do wrong, 
Altho' 
e 
always merry; 
Tho' fond of jokes, we do no harm, 
We're merely " jolly boys," 
Who now and then cause some alarm, 
When we're kicking up a 
noise. 
Slap, dash! etc.

THE MUSICAL 
PARTY. 
As first sung in America by HARRY RICHMOND, with great 
applause. 
Music at 0. DITSON'S, 711 Broadway, New York. 
M RS. Jones gave a 
musical party, 
• 
And friends she invited them all ; 
There was old Mr. Bonner, so hearty, 
And young Mr. Jenkins, so tall; 
And singing young ladies they came by the dozen, 
With half a 
crown copies tied up in a 
roll. 
Handsome Miss Johnson, her brother and cousin, 
And Bunker, who prates of his musical soul. 
And very queer songs they were singing. 
If I 
can remember a 
few, 
S, 
THE MUSICAL PAATY. 
66 
THE MUSICAL PARTY. 
As they are in my ears ringing, 
I'll try to repeat them to you. 
After a 
deal of persuasion, 
Miss Johnson consented to sing 
A 
piece of her vocalization, 
Which doubtless she thought quite the thing 
She simper'd and whimper'd in such a 
queer manner, 
And up to the instrument came with a 
swing ; 
And thumping five minutes upon the piano, 
For symphony, this is the song she did sing :— 
" 
Oh would I 
were a 
bird." 
Now was not that absurd 
To hear a 
lady singing, 
She would like to be a 
bird. 
How very strange to see 
Her perched upon a 
tree, 
And screwing up her mouth, 
To whistle some new melody; 
Could she get any rest, 
Tuck'd up in a 
nest, 
And feeding on canary seed 
And chickweed of the best. 
So I 
thought it so absurd, 
To wish she was a 
bird, 
But that was not the only 
Very funny song I 
heard. 
A 
tall, sentimental young lady, 
,Was pressed very hard for a 
song; 
Young, did I 
say, on the shady side 
Of two score, perhaps I 
am wrong. 
She twisted her mouth in a 
curious fashion, 
Her hands on the instrument came with a 
bang, 
Went over the keys in a 
style she thought dashing, 
And this was the style of the song that she sang :— 
" 
Oh, if I 
had some one to love me." 
I 
thought it would be a 
hard case, 
If she ever found some one to love her, 
She made such a 
funny grimace ; 
She wanted some one to share trouble, 
Their care to the winds she would fling, 
And change her from single to double, 
So she continued to sing— 
Oh, if I 
had some one to love me. 
I 
thought, tho' it may be too bad, 
If ' twould put an end to her singing, 
We'd be satisfied if she had. 
Young Tomkins, who's just one and twenty, 
Considered a 
nob and. a 
swell, 
If cheek constitutes he had plenty, 
And self-estimation as well ; 
He said " be would give us a 
comical ditty, 
If we'd join in the coal-box," that was his slang. 
I 
cannot acknowledge ' twas wonderful witty, 
Judge for yourself by the song that he sang. 
"Oh, Jerusalem ! Jerusalem ! Jerusalem! 
Oh, Jerusalem ! the costermonger's donkey !" 
Of their singing and shouting quite tired 
I 
was when a 
gentleman cried, 
in a 
song that is always admired, 
Whenever to sing I've tried; 
It certainly was not a 
drawing-room ditty, 
I'll try and remember a 
verse if I 
can, 
He claimed our indulgence as well as our pity, 
And clearing his throat "hem" in this style 
began: 
When Johnny comes marching home again, 1ml-1%A., 
hurrah, 
Well give him a 
hearty welcome then, hurrah, hurrch, 
• 
GS 
SWEtT JENNY ; OR, WHERE CAN SHE BE . 
The girls will sing, and the boys will shout, 
And the neighbors they will all turn out, 
And we'll feel all gay when Johnny comes marching home. 
They shouted out till they were hoarse, hurrah, hurrah 
Discordant voices loud and coarse, hurrah, hurrah I" 
Unobserved I 
slipped away well satisfied with every lay, 
Tho' I 
cannot say " that I 
felt gay till I 
was safe at home." 
SWEET JENNY • OR, WHERE CAN SITE BE. 
Sung with great applause by H ARRY HICRM'OND. 
I 
CO ME from Laaf-and-daaf-and-half-and-half, 
Across the Welsh mountains, 
Where the leeks and the violets, 
And the nanny- goats do dwell; 
I 
come here in search 
Of a 
lovely young damsel, 
And where she has gone to 
I'm sure I 
can't tell. 
SPOKEN. —
More I 
can. 
CHORUS . 
So I 
weep and wander, 
Through vales and o'er mountains, 
To find my sweet Jennie, 
Oh where can she be, 
She's a 
charming young gender, 
Her waist is so slender, 
Her hair is magenta, 
And she squints with one eye. 
She talks like a 
parson, 
She sings like a 
nightingale, 
And if I 
don't find her, 
SWEET JENNY ; OR, WHERE CAN SHE BE . 69 
I'm sure I 
shall die. 
SPOKEN.—S0 
I 
shall. 
So I 
weep, etc. 
Her home and her parients, 
Are highly i;espectable ; 
Her mother milks cows 
On a 
three-legged stool ; 
Tier father's a 
farmer, 
What grows the green turnip- tops; 
Her sister's a 
dairy- maid, 
And her brother's a 
fool. 
SPOKEN.—So 
he are. 
So I 
weep, etc. 
I 
courted sweet Jenny, 
I 
told her I 
loved her, 
We were to be married 
Upon a 
May morn. 
When there came a 
gay soldier 
In the royal artillery, 
And on the next morning 
Sweet Jenny was gone. 
SPOKEN.—SO 
she were. 
So I 
weep, etc. 
0, say, have you seen her'? 
To you I'll describe her, 
She wears a 
red petticoat, 
Ami a 
hat on her head. 
She speaks while she's talking, 
She moves when she's walking, 
And her linen is marked, 
0, P, Q, X, Y, Z. 
SrokEN.—So it is. 
So I 
weep, etc. 
But I 
never shall find her, 
She's gone with her soldier, 
70 
THE GOOD-NATURED MIN . 
So farewell to the violets, 
And the moo- cows so brown, 
Farewell to the nanny- goats ; 
To the sea- shore I'll wander, 
And in the cold water 
I'll lay myself down 
SPOKEN.-S0 
I 
will. 
CHORUS. 
So no more will I 
wander, 
Thro' vales and o'er mountains, 
Farewell ! my sweet Jenny,. 
Wherever you be. 
THE GOOD-TEMPERED MAN. 
Sung by H ARRY RICHMOND. 
Wuirr a 
pity to hear some people declare 
That life is a 
burden of sorrow and care ; 
I've lived forty years in this valley of tears, 
And of troubles I've had a 
full share, 
And I 
find it is wiser to laugh than to cry, 
And merrily sing if you can ; 
Clouds that are dark may clear by-and-by, 
So laugh like a 
good-tempered man. 
Ha! ha! ha! 
I 
was always a 
good-tempered man. 
My courting I 
paid to a 
fair pretty maid, 
When I 
asked her to wed she lovingly said, 
" 
Dear Daniel, it's true I'm faithful to you, 
Believe me and don't be afraid " 
But in less than a 
month, her promise she broke, 
And off with another she ran ; 
BEN BOLT 'S REPLY . 
71 
I 
laughed and treated it all as a 
joke, 
For I'm such a 
good-tempered man. 
Ha! ha! ha! 
Oh, I'm such a 
good-tempered man. 
A mob in the street I 
happened to meet, 
A 
thief with a 
snatch ran away with my watch, 
My hat with surprise was knock'd over my eyes, 
Crying " Stop thief," the people all ran, 
But I 
never moved an inch from the spot, 
But to laugh and to dance I 
began, 
To think what a 
guy at that moment I 
look'd, 
Oh I'm such a 
good-tempered man. 
Ha! ha! ha! 
Oh! Pm such a 
good-tempered man. 
Then never give way to that demon dismay, 
If to- day you are down and acquaintances frown, 
To-morrow may bring quite a 
different thing, 
And life's but a 
flash in the pan. 
If care, as they tell us, once killed a 
poor cat, 
Though scarcely believe them I 
can, 
Like me you are bound to get jolly and fat, 
If you laugh like a 
good-tempered man. 
ha ! ha! ha! 
I 
was always a 
good-tempered man. 
BEN BOLT'S REPLY. 
Sung by H ARRY RICHMOND with great applause. 
All ! yes, I 
remember that name with delight, 
Sweet Alice, so cherished and dear, 
I 
seek her lone grave in the pale hour of night, 
And moisten the turf with a 
tear, 
72 
BEN BOLT'S REPLY. 
And there when the heart is o'er burdened with woes, 
I 
wander and muse all alone; 
And long for the time when my head shall repose 
Where sweet Alice lies under the stone. 
And long, etc. 
I 
roam through the wood where so joyous we strayed, 
And recline on the green sunny hill, 
All things are as bright in that beautiful glade, 
But my heart is all lonely and chill, 
For the hand that so fondly I 
then pressed in mine, 
And the lips that were melting with love, 
Are ()old in the grave, and I'm left to repine, 
'Till I 
meet with dear Alice above, 
Are cold, etc. 
Ah ! well I 
remember the school-house and brook, 
And the master so kind and so true, 
The wild blooming flowers in the cool shady nook, 
So fragrant with incense and dew, 
But I 
weep not for these though so dear to my heart, 
Nor the friends that have left us alone, 
The bosom will heave and the tear drops will start, 
For sweet Alice lies under the stone. 
For sweet, etc.
