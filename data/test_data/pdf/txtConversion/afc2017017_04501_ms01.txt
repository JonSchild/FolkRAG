Kevin: Over there, in there are times when I see people burning things in that same area all the 
time, they're taking down leaves and trees or whatever. And then they got scheduled burns, but 
they were warnings to not do that. 
 
KDS: Yeah, that's what Bonnie [Archer of Zephaniah Winery] was saying is she said there were 
red flags or something about... 
 
Kevin: Yeah, exactly. 
 
KDS: It's not something we have as much in town since you're not really supposed to be burning 
huge piles of things. But yeah, it's definitely gusty out there and a couple of people. 
 
00:00:31 
Kevin: And a couple people said they saw maybe a dozen firetrucks going to that site. It's 
obviously out now, which is great, but I was like, man, the winds are ripping, and they're ripping 
this direction, it's... 
 
KDS: Not a great day to have that brush bonfire. 
Kevin: Exactly. 
KDS: But everybody's pruning. 
 
Kevin: True.

KDS: Sorry, this is... Belfort [furniture store] makes a too comfortable cushion here. I'm like 
sinking in a little bit. 
 
Kevin: Yeah, so are their pillows and [indiscernible]. 
 
00:00:54 
KDS: I'm sure. Yeah. Its accouterments... okay. Alright, so I'm gonna start by saying, this is Kim 
Stryker, and today is... It's not recording. Okay. Record. I'm gonna start by saying, this is Kim 
Stryker, and today is Thursday, April 12th, 2018. The time is now 5:42 in the afternoon, and I'm 
here with Kevin Switz, and we are in a upstairs room at the Stone Tower winery in--this is 
Leesburg still? 
 
Kevin: Yeah, technically it's Leesburg. 
 
KDS: Okay, Leesburg, Virginia in Loudoun County. So, Kevin, how did you get into this line of 
work? 
#finedining #BayArea #Californian #JamesBeard #LarkCreekInn 
00:01:40 
Kevin: Well, for me, I started in a fine dining background. I was born and raised in the Bay Area 
of California, but I moved to Texas, and the drinking age is only 17, as opposed to 21 in 
California. So I got a chance to actually bartend/wait tables when I was about 17/18 years old. 
And ultimately I moved back to California having bartended and waiting tables, and it allowed 
me an access to sort of the upper echelon of really fine dining restaurants. I worked at the Lark 
Creek Inn with Bradley Ogden, who's a James Beard award winning chef--[cough] excuse me-- 
in Warren County. 
 
KDS: That was called the Lark Creek... 
#MichaelMina #BourbonSteak #sommelier #RajatParr #WineSpectator #WarrenCounty 
00:02:26 
Kevin: Yeah, the Lark Creek Inn, 3 words. And he won James Beard best chef, United States in 
Las Vegas, and I got a chance to work with him--you know-for several years in Warren County 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017

just north of San Francisco. I would say the most famous place I got a chance to work, and a very 
privileged opportunity, was at Michael Mina San Francisco, so Michael Mina now has Bourbon 
Steaks and, you know, New York Steaks, and Michael Mina's all over RN74 is also one of his 
concepts. But I got the privilege to work with Rajat Parr--Raj Parr--a very famous sommelier 
who wrote a book called "Sommelier Secrets", and we actually won the grand award from the 
Wine Spectator 
 
KDS: Wow! 
 
00:03:07 
Kevin: In our first year, which I don't think has been done since, and I know it'd never been done 
before, and this was in early 2000. And I was there for a few years. And it was a beautiful wine 
list. It was over a million dollars, maybe 3000 selections... 
 
KDS: Wow! 
 
Kevin: ... from all over the world. 
KDS: Yeah. 
#FineWine #Burgundy #French #expensive #Sonoma #Napa #RussianRiver #Monterey 
#foodandwinepairing #WineDirector #InnatLittleWashington 
 
Kevin: And I got a chance to try some wines that--[clears throat] I apologize--I got chance to try 
wines I couldn't afford, right? And I'm talking wines that are 3-, 4-, 5-thousand dollars a bottle, 
and from all over the globe and Raj's focus was about Burgundy. So he was all about French 
chardonnays and pinot noirs from these amazing sites. But just being in that environment, you 
know, you're close to the wine country. So, Sonoma, Napa, the Russian River. You know, if you 
really wanna go to Southern California, Monterey, you're very close, so you get a chance to meet 
a lot of really wonderful chefs, and they're very talented and um very driven and very creative. 
And then the food and wine pairing part of it is what gets exciting 'cause if you get to try wines 
from around the world and you get to play with how these things work together, that's exciting. 
And so a lot of times a chef will create a dish and say, you know, "Find a wine that works for 
me." I think it's kind of fun to go the other way where you actually choose the wine and then 
craft a dish around it. That's kinda what I do with friends, now. But ultimately that's it. You 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017

know, I wanted to transition out of restaurant into things that were more wine related. And 
several of my friends are famous, sommeliers, advanced sommeliers, or master sommeliers 
around the globe. So um one of my old girlfriends was Jennifer Knolls, and she was the Wine 
Director at Inn at Little Washington for about 4 years. 
 
KDS: Okay. 
#sommelier #blindtasting #winetest #winetheory 
00:04:50 
Kevin: And she's an advanced sommelier, who's... which is basically the third level in the court 
of sommelier. And you get invited on test as a master. And I think they're less than 200 masters 
now. So, a lot of blind tasting. And, um, when they're testing in the court, they're doing service 
and theory and blind tasting. So service would be as though I was serving you as a master 
sommelier with other masters, presenting bottles, talking about it, and you're asking me 
questions. So this is more like tableside in a restaurant setting. Theory is what most people fail, 
but it's literally all the laws and everything that governs and dictates all of spirits and wine, 
especially around the globe. 
 
KDS: Right. 
 
Kevin: So it could be South African or Georgia, in Russia. 
KDS: Yeah. 
#wineregions #tasting #varietals #taste 
 
Kevin: It could be Greece, it could be Oregon, whatever. So, you know, what happens is, as you 
go up that ladder, they open up more and more wines for you then to blind taste. You start at the 
entry level, there's only a certain family of wines you'll try, and then there's certified, and then 
once you've gone beyond that, the advanced, it just keeps expanding the number of types of wine 
around the world you try you. So from being around them, I got exposed to taste, how to blind 
taste, how to describe these wines, and sort of specializing your sort of individual tool kit. And 
you know... And what's coveted about that wine? Why is that $5,000? Why is this $100? So, you 
get to see it from a lot of different sides, but just a restaurant background, that sort of transitioned 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
4
and a little bit more wine-related. And then I think once you get an opportunity to see wine- 
making environments and talk to the winemakers and understand the varietals and the regions 
and how this all plays out historically, um, I think it's, you know, where do we fit in America? 
How do we fit in how this has always been done? I think it's a great story, and I think it's, you 
know, what I am excited about being in Virginia about. Yeah. 
 
00:06:53 
KDS: That's a very good point because I think the question of where does Virginia fit. I mean 
it's... When I started this project, it was partly because I'm from Virginia, and I've grown up and 
seen this explosion in the industry, but also because there was so little documentation of 
American wine in the Library of Congress that I really wanted to change that because it's become 
such a huge industry. And I was shocked that there was so little representation of what's 
happened there, as far as documentation of the wines themselves. So how did you come to be in 
Virginia? 
#Virginia #InnofLittleWashington #EastCoast #WineDirector #Loudoun #growthofindustry 
00:07:30 
Well, Jen got the opportunity at the Inn of Little Washington. So the young lady I mentioned, she 
took that position, and we had always talked about being on the East Coast, and... To be a Wine 
Director at that restaurant--it's the most decorated in Western and American history, which just 
celebrated a 40-year anniversary, so: amazing cellar, amazing opportunity. And we had talked 
about living on the East Coast, and I like Vir-- I like Virginia very much. And um, there... I had 
no idea how burgeoning the wine world was here. You know, now they're... By the end of this 
year--calendar year--I think we'll be a 300 wineries plus, statewide, and it's my understanding, 
we're well over 51 in Loudoun County where we are right now. 
 
KDS: Is it that many? Wow! 
 
#geology #strata #Appalachian 
00:08:12 
Kevin: So you go back some 20 years ago, maybe there were 4 or 5. So exponentially this has 
grown, but this corridor specifically, you know, has really, um, exploded. And a lot of people ask 
me why, and, you know, what is this about? And I think, honestly, worldwide, more people are 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017

planting the right things in the right places. A lot of it is driven by geology and strata. You know, 
where we're located, in the Appalachian is geologically, it's over a billion years old, and at one 
point, these mountains were higher than the Himalayas, and they were worn down to being a 
very deep seabed. 
 
KDS: So hard to imagine! 
 
#Virginia #growingchallenges #airflow #claysoil #toomuchrain #hilly #rocky #windy 
 
Kevin: And then Pangaea 16 million years ago when it broke apart, it rose up to the level you see 
now worn down to. Um, the other thing I would say is that Virginia is kind of synonymous with 
clay, which is a very dense topsoil that absorbs a lot of water. Well, our land here--our lowest 
low is 650 feet above sea level; our highest high is 850 feet above sea level with the ridge lines. 
A lot of convection, as we're talking about; a lot of air flow here. Our biggest concern is too 
much water in Virginia. So we get twice the rain of Bordeaux, and Bordeaux is a wet place, and 
so you need hilly and rocky and windy. At its most dense, we're only at 23% clay on this 
property. 
 
00:09:36 
KDS: Oh wow! 
 
Kevin: So a lot of sandstone and shale, and greenschist and things like that, and um, you know, 
all the stone you see on our property has been picked from the vineyards, and sometimes these 
pieces were picked as many as 3 times, just to get... 
 
KDS: To clear... 
 
#ecosystems #differentconditions #acid #sugar #TheHubers #owners #Belfort #family 
 
Kevin: ... to clear it out, to get vineyard in the ground. Um, and so, you know, there's-- There are 
lots of different challenges in every environment. You know, in California, you have this set of 
issues, and if you're in Bordeaux or, you know, Austria or wherever. You know, if you're in a 
cool place, you have no trouble getting acid, but you struggle to get sugar. You're in a warm in 
place, you can get sugar, and it's hard to get acid. Certain varietals thrive in these different kind 
of ecosystems, you know. So, when we were looking at this property, you know, Mike and Kristi 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017

Huber are the owners, and they own Belfort Furniture, which is local furniture stores they've had 
about 30 years now,. 
 
10:30 KDS: Now, me just clarify, how does Kristi spell her name? 
Kevin: K-R-I-S-T-I. 
KDS: Okay and... 
 
Kevin: And it's H-U-B-E-R, Huber, and Mike. 
KDS: And it's Belfort is the company. 
#cattle #grazing 
 
Kevin: Right. And what happened was Mike's parents purchased 1200 acres out here in 1975, 
and this was a 206-acre parcel in the middle of their family land. But what you see on property 
like this is people would just clear the trees and have meadow for horse and cattle, for grazing. 
 
KDS: Right. 
 
Kevin: People wouldn't think about putting traditional crops in the ground like corn or soybean-- 
anything like that. But it is ideal for vineyards, so... 
 
KDS: Yeah. 
 
#landpreservation #workingfarm #wineconsultants #LucyMorton #JimLaw #LucaPaschina 
#vineyardselection #viognier #chardonnay 
 
Kevin: They were trying to figure out a way to preserve the land and share it, have a working 
farm, and then generate. Right, so they did bring in international wine consultants and also 
famous Virginia wine consultants. An example would be Lucy Morton. We're talking, you know, 
like those Jim law, the Luca Pashina. You know, the-- [...], from a chemical standpoint, you 
know, discovered all kinds of things very specific to our environment here, identified them, 
catalog them, and so on. But both Lucy and the international consultant agreed, you know, this is 
a beautiful piece of land. And they planted a little viognier and a little chardonnay about 11 years 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017

ago, which would have been in 2007, and our first little vintages of viogniers and chardonnays 
were 2009. 
 
KDS: Okay. So... 
 
Kevin: And... Go ahead. 
 
00:12:02 
KDS: Sorry, just for timing, cause we've been kind of... and it will be like this, we'll jump 
around, but um, when did you come out to Virginia? When was that about? 
 
Kevin: 8 years ago. 
KDS: 8 years ago,. 
Kevin: Yeah. 
KDS: Okay, so... 
Kevin: 2010. 
KDS: 2010. 
 
Kevin: You got it. Sorry. 
 
KDS: Okay, that's okay. I just wanna give it some structure. And then you came to... when did 
they open Stone Tower, or when did they start deciding it was gonna be..? 
 
Kevin: When they decided to create a physical space for tasting was 4 and a half years ago 
October. And we did it in the barn you see up the hill. 
 
KDS: Okay. 
 
#kidfriendly #dogfriendly 
 
Kevin: That is also a kid and dog friendly. 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017

KDS: Right. 
 
Kevin: As you heard me joke the other day, I always lump kids and dogs together. 
KDS: Right. 
#adultsonly #tastingroom #Delaplane #RdV #Bordeaux #RutgerdeVink 
 
Kevin: But this is 2 and a half years October for adults--same wines, same everything here, but 
they basically built the barn. It had equipment, then they retrofit it. They built production, we 
started doing wine on property and just expanding it to have these other spaces to, you know, get 
involved in. Now, I was at RdV vineyards in Delaplane for one year, and this was--I was in 
restaurant, but I was also doing this on the weekends. And Rutger de Vink is RdV. They do very, 
very high end Bordeaux blends, and it's a gated winery, appointment only. 
 
KDS: Right. 
 
Kevin: It's very boutique. Amazing wines. 
KDS: Yeah. 
#blindtastings #VirginiaVsBordeaux 
 
Kevin: And I was doing blind tastings for them, so we were pouring wines from Napa and from 
Bordeaux against these wines blind. And I did that for a year. 
 
KDS: Okay. 
 
Kevin: And then a little bit after that, I came here, and that was a little over 3 and a half years 
ago. 
 
KDS: So when... Sorry, just to clarify, when you were doing blind tastings at RdV, was that for 
their guests or for their staff? 
 
00:13:51 
Kevin: This was for people... 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017

KDS: For training? 
 
Kevin: ... for people to come join, so... 
KDS: Okay. 
#OldWorld #NewWorld 
 
Kevin: So you could have a tour where you can walk the property for a certain amount of money; 
they'd pour a couple wines for you, but you could also sign up specifically for this event. This 
was sort of like two wines--Old World and New World--versus their two. 
 
KDS: Okay. 
 
#RightBank #LeftBank 
 
Kevin: So it was like a Right Bank and a Left Bank example of their land. And if you want me to 
clarify what that all means, I can do that, as we did the other day. 
 
KDS: Sure, yeah, maybe. 
 
Kevin: Or... okay, sorry. I have a lot to say. 
KDS: That's okay. [Laughing] 
Kevin: So, um, so, one of Rutger's things that he loved to do was go down into his cellar and just 
open a bottle, put it in a decanter, and not tell you what it was. 
 
KDS: Okay. 
 
#Chassange-Montrachet #whiteburgundy #blindtasting #Garonne #Dordogne #Gironde 
 
Kevin: And then bring it to you and say, "What do you think this is?" White or red. And, um, the 
first night I met him, I said, you know, I think this first wine you've given me a 2007 Chassagne- 
Montrachet, and it was a 2007 Chassagne-Montrachet. So I got lucky, and I got a white 
Burgundy... 
 
KDS: Okay. 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
10
 
Kevin: ... and the right vintage and everything. So I think he then took me kind of seriously like, 
okay. Getting the wine right isn't a big deal. But the point is, he always had a vision to just have 
these 2 really beautiful examples of right and Left Bank Bordeaux wines from his land. Now, 
there's a series of rivers that divide Bordeaux. There's the Garonne and the Dordogne. And they 
form the Gironde that goes into an estuary, and it divides Bordeaux. 
 
00:15:20 
KDS: You're gonna have to spell those rivers for me. 
Kevin: Okay. 
KDS: Can you? [Laughs] Let's try! 
Kevin: G-I-R-O-N-D-E. Gironde. 
KDS: Okay. 
Kevin: That's the big river. 
KDS: Okay. 
Kevin: Now the Garonne is G-A-R-R-O-N-N-E I do believe. The Garrone. 
KDS: G-A-R-R-O-N-E? 
Kevin: Yeah. 
 
KDS: Okay. 
 
Kevin: And I think there might be 2 Ns. 
KDS: Oh, 2 Ns. 
Kevin: Garronne. Yeah. 
 
KDS: Okay. 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
11
 
Kevin: And Dourdogne I think is D-O-U-R-D-O-G-N-E. Dourdogne. I'm not positive, but I 
think... 
 
KDS: Okay. 
 
Kevin: Like if you look at a map. 
 
KDS: That would get me close enough that then... 
 
Kevin: There's 2 tributaries, and they kind of go like--one goes like this, and one curves in, and 
then you go out to the sea. Anyway, those rivers divide Bordeaux. 
 
KDS: Okay. 
 
00:16:05 
 
#geology #sand #clay #limestone #varietals 
 
Kevin: And the geology is very specialized, and the French have very specifically over the last 2 
years--I mean 200 years--planted the varietals based on the geology. So in French, the Left Bank 
is Rive Gauche, and the Right Bank is Rive Droite. And most of the Left Bank wines are 
cabernet because the geology is sand and gravel and stone. Most of the right is a combination 
usually of merlot and cab franc, and there's a little more clay and more limestone, more plateau. 
And it's hilly-er. 
 
KDS: Okay. [Taking notes] Clay. Clay's not spelled that way. And um, could you say granite as 
well on that side? 
 
Kevin: Not really, it's more limestone. 
KDS: Oh, limestone. 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
12
Kevin: Yeah. And, you know, the strata will differ depending on where you are, and there are 
exceptions, but the most famous examples on the left or cabernet-based wines. And the most 
famous examples on the right are merlot- and cab franc-based wines. 
 
KDS: Gotcha. 
 
Kevin: So that's what Rutger did. He did a right and a left example of his land, and we've done 
the same here. And you see people do that, where they're basically having a blend that dominates 
cab franc and merlot blend and one that's mostly cabernet. 
 
KDS: Okay. 
 
00:17:17 
Kevin: So what he then wanted to do was say, "Okay, if I'm selling these bottles at $80 or $90 a 
bottle, and I pour a $200 Napa cab, and a $400 bottle of Bordeaux, and you don't know what's 
what, what are you gonna choose? Do you like my wines? If you don't, that's fine. I just wanna 
show you how these can hold their place at the table," if that makes sense. 
 
KDS: Yeah. 
 
#showingwell #blindtasting 
 
Kevin: Okay, and I feel the same way about our wines. We have the Windswept Hill and the 
Hogback mountain, and you got to try the Hogback the other day, but we've done a right and a 
Left Bank example here. And I think those two, when you put them in a blind tasting lineup, they 
show very well. 
 
KDS: Okay. 
 
#restaurants #RdV #tastingassociate #brandambassador #tours #part-time 
 
Kevin: But my whole history in Virginia is about 8 years. I was in restaurants the first several 
years. I did a part time year at RdV, and I've now been at Stone Tower 3 and a half years. Just 
starting out as a tasting associate, and they knew my background, I had a lot of experience, and 
then they asked me to be full time, and then they may be brand ambassador, and then they made 
me senior brand ambassador, 'cause there's 7 additional brand ambassadors below me now. And 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
13
they're just people that we feel like can handle any sort of tasting situation, a tour, any kind of 
review of the property, answer, any questions, that sort of thing. 
 
KDS: Right. Without gaffes or... 
 
Kevin: I mean, you've got a lot of tasting associates here, and there are kinda part time some of 
our teachers, nurses, they're here a day or 2 every couple of weeks, or whatever. These are a little 
more full time and... 
 
KDS: Yeah. 
 
Kevin: ... you know, a little more focused. And we're doing a lot of study outside of work too... 
KDS: Okay. 
Kevin: ... to know more and more, you know, so, if that makes sense. 
 
KDS: Yeah, um, so 3 and a half years at Stone Tower, you've been working your way up from 
just sort of part time like, "Oh, this is a nice place" or whatever. But then you decided that this 
was really something you could get serious about. 
 
00:19:11 
 
#qualitywine #weddings #parties #opportunity #co-workers #family #pride 
#greatworkenvironement #customerservice #growth 
 
Kevin: Well and the thing was, um, I hadn't even heard of Stone Tower. We didn't do 
advertising, and I heard of many and tried literally hundreds and hundreds of Virginia wines, 
some in blind tastings for magazines and other things. Anyway, I came out here and I got to taste 
all the wines, whether they were estate or not. And I liked all of them. I thought they were all of 
great quality, regardless of where they were from our land or not. And I knew the property was 
expanding, cause I could see they were building all this out, and they were gonna do weddings, 
and they were gonna host big parties, but they were gonna... Just, there was an opportunity for a 
tremendous amount of growth. 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
14
 
KDS: Yeah. 
 
Kevin: Now, the family is amazing and the management team is amazing, and that's unusual. For 
me, it's all about environment, and I have to be really, really proud of what I'm talking about. I 
can't just sort of take something that's kinda substandard and just go out there and shine it up. 
This is a beautiful piece of land, and the family and management team are very special. 
KDS: Yeah. 
Kevin: And they actually allow me to be myself, and they allow me to do what I love to do, and 
the wines are of exceptional quality, so, you know, why not? Why wouldn't you love to do that? 
 
KDS: Well, and you would know from working in the restaurant world, that you could have 
someone who's really, really talented at making gorgeous food in a beautiful restaurant and a 
wonderful location, but there can be terrible management, or there could be the chef that throws 
pots and pans and knives at you or whatever. 
 
Kevin: I've seen it all. I can assure you. 
 
KDS: Yeah, so, when you can find a place where everything is kind of clicking for you. 
 
Kevin: And I think when you see the kind of growth that we've had and evolution here, the truth 
is that when you look at the financial numbers of this facility here, if we had sold more wine in 
the very first year, we opened the tasting room. We would have been in the Fortune 500. 
 
KDS: Oh wow! 
 
#exponentialgrowth #connection #tastingassociates 
 
Kevin: So the amount of exponential growth in a very short window of time is tremendous. And 
for us to manage a small winery feel in a big winery setting is everything that we talk about. 
We're very focused on trying to keep that intimacy, even if you've got a 1000 people here and 
where that's gonna come from is a connection with your tasting associates, whether it's 
knowledge, humor, it's their awareness, it's the connection, it's the customer service, it's all of 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
15
those types of things. But I'm really most proud of how we've grown, what we've done and still 
the positive feedback from the bulk of the public. 
 
KDS: Yeah. 
 
Kevin: It's just hard to grow like this... 
KDS: Yeah. 
Kevin: ... without really disenfranchising or upsetting people or whatever. So to me, just to see 
the happiness and the people that still love coming back, and you know, they may come out on 
this day or that, but you know, some like the crazy weekends, and some just wanna hang out on a 
Monday or... 
 
KDS: How late are you guys open? 
 
#businesshours #wineclub 
 
Kevin: We're open 11 to 5:30--we stop pouring wine, and then we close at 6 Thursday through 
Monday. Most Fridays though we do extended hours, 6 to 8:30, close at 9, for members. So we 
have a club. 
 
KDS: Uh, 6 to 8:30 for wine club. 
 
Kevin: And then close at 9 most Fridays. Yeah. And that part's adults only, you know, when you 
do, after--after hours stuff it's member only. 
 
KDS: Okay.

Kevin: Anyway, I think that for me, food and wine was my life, but I think there's a whole other 
layer to it when you get the chance to be in an environment like this. Because one of the things 
that Jeremy and I have created--he's the hospitality director and the sales manager, his name is 
aged Jeremy's Zimmerman. We've created a project here, we call "somminar." It's like a 
sommelier seminar. And what we've done is we've started by choosing a region or choosing a

varietal, and it's unique to go to a winery and try someone else's wines. And part of this grew out 
of our staff tastings. We don't wanna be drinking the Stone Tower Kool Aid. We don't wanna be 
drinking a Virginia... You know, we don't want a Virginia palate or an American palate; we want 
a global palate, and the only way you're gonna have that and maintain that is to continually try 
wines from around the globe. 
 
KDS: So these "somminars" are things you've organized for the staff? 
Kevin: Actually, it's for customers. 
KDS: Oh, okay. 
 
#teaching #wineeducation #chardonnays #differentregions 
 
Kevin: What it is, is it evolved out of staff tasting. Okay, so let's say we wanted to teach 
someone about chardonnay. What we would do is we would buy 3 chardonnays that were 
French, where it all started in Burgundy, and then we would buy chardonnays from Australia, in 
California, and all over the world. And then we would have some of our chardonnays. So the 
way it evolved was, we're trying to give the staff the whole spectrum of what chardonnay can be. 
 
KDS: Right. 
 
Kevin: And here's where it started, here's how other people do it, and here's how we do it. 
KDS: Right. 
#DefiningOldWorld/NewWorld #geology #history #chemistry #education 
 
Kevin: And so think of the source, you know--and this brings up a point that we kind of talked 
about the other day, but it's Old World versus New. Anything that's not Western Europe basically 
is New World. It could be South America, South Africa. It could be Oregon, it could be here, it 
could be New Zealand, but anywhere not Western European. So, you know, most of the sources 
of these are in the Old World, and then this genetic material has been then planted all over the 
world. And the same exact genetic material planted at all over the globe is gonna create different 
wines, different geology, different weather, different winemaking. All these things are gonna be 
very, very distinct and different. And so we've done a lot of variations on these somminars, but it 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017

has--it's been really fun because if you have a basic amount of information, a foundation, if you 
will, and then you dive in a champagne or here or there, all a sudden you can just plug those 
things in very quickly, this kind of a dynamic thing. He and I go back and forth, and we talk 
about geology and history and chemistry, and-- and just how it all started from the very 
beginning. So it's just been fun to learn more and more and more and more. 
 
00:25:28 
KDS: Yeah, so how do you structure it? Is it like an event on your calendar that people can sign 
up for. 
 
Kevin: Yeah, will send out a set of emails and we'll say, hey, we're doing viognier, a Northern 
Rhone white varietal, and it's 9 wines, and there will be a little food pairing. And so we'll meet it 
with bubbly and then we'll have a trio... 
 
KDS: That's the best way to meet people. 
 
Kevin: Right? Always right. So, but it's like a trio, a trio, trio, things like that. So it's usually 9 or 
10 wines, either by varietal or by region. We've done Left Bank and Right Bank Bordeaux wines, 
we've done rosés. You know, we've done sparkling wines, you know on the holidays and stuff 
like that. But that's just one of many really fun and unique things because we actually can sell 
those wines to them. 
 
KDS: Oh, okay. 
 
Kevin: So we're always trying to highlight what we're doing here, and you know, we could put 
these wines up against wines that are kind of substandard, but we actually choose the best 
examples around the world. 
 
KDS: Right. 
 
Kevin: And we really wanna show them that. 
KDS: Yeah. 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017

Kevin: You know, these wines stack up to the wines that are like $50, $100, more--you know, 
things like that. 
 
KDS: Right. 
 
#owner 
 
Kevin: Cause Mike [the owner] will come in and see these things like, what are you guys doing? 
Like, Oh my god, these wines are incredible. 
 
KDS: Right. 
 
Kevin: And he believes in our estate wines and, you know, and our Wild Boar wines too. But I 
think there have been many times where he was surprised at the lineup we chose. He tried them 
all together, and he's like, "You know what?" 
 
KDS: Yeah. 
 
Kevin: "You're basically putting our wines up against the best." 
KDS: Yeah. 
#weddings #parties #catering #differences among Virginia wineries #experiences 
 
Kevin: And, and that's, and that's, and that's it to me about Virginia too. You know that, that 
there are a lot of wineries here, and everyone's focus is different. Some wanna capitalize on 
weddings and some of that business where they have cater, do big parties. Some are all about the 
wine. Maybe they've got a really small facility. Like Zephaniah doesn't produce much wine. But, 
you know what I'm saying? Like they're all about the wine. 
 
KDS: Yeah. 
 
Kevin: And it's about this really kind of intimate, like you're-in-my-living-room kind of 
experience. 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
19
KDS: Well, and very... like with the example of Zephaniah, they make all blends, they make 
what suits them. You know what I mean? They're not necessarily trying to make something that 
is comparable to anything else cause they're just making what they think is great. 
 
Kevin: Yes. 
KDS: Yeah. So that's... You see a lot of this kind of individualism, I think in Virginia wine. 
00:27:46 
#terroir #tasteofplace 
 
Kevin: Oh yeah, there are a lot of people, they're going to their own drummer, and I think that 
that always is a big question that I get too, is that, you know, our estate wines are really quite 
excellent, but we're not trying to mimic Europe. We're not trying to mimic California. We are 
really trying to be about this piece of land, and you hear people use the term terroir quite 
frequently. And I think that most people think that's the soil, in their mind--like terra firma, you 
know, like terroir. 
 
KDS: Yeah. 
 
#yeasts #bacteria #wine flavor #geology 
 
Kevin: But for us, it's everything about this place. It is the geology and the strata. Yes, that is 
special and unique, but it's the aspect of the hill. It's the winemaker. It's the weather. It is the 
ambient, indigenous bacteria, the wild yeasts. These are things that we've actually cataloged and 
replicate it. You know, we've done for malolactic bacterium from our land, like Stone Tower 
Winery 1-2-3. You know, like that. 
 
KDS: Oh, wow, okay. 
 
#oakbarrels #VirginiaOak #whiteoak 
 
Kevin: And we've been using will indigenous yeasts. We also have cut some white oak, and 
you're not gonna make a barrel out of white oak unless it's been cured, dried a minimum of 3 
years, but at some point, we will have our own Stone Tower white oak, Virginia barrels... 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
20
 
KDS: Oh wow! 
 
Kevin: ... right off for our own piece of land. So, um, you know... 
KDS: That's unusual. Definitely. 
Kevin: It is and... 
KDS: I haven't heard of anyone doing that. 
00:29:15 
Kevin: Well, we just took a delivery, actually, of 40, Virginia white oak barrels, but they were 
from Southern Virginia. You know, but the key is that wine barrels and these casks--these very... 
59-gallon, you know, oak. Regardless of where they're from, they are gonna be dried and cured a 
minimum of 3 years, and then you're requesting a certain level of toast where they caramelize the 
inside, you know, things like that. But I'm just saying that that illustrates to me and illustrated to 
me their commitment to really represent everything about this piece of land. 
 
KDS: Yeah. 
Kevin: And I think that's un-- unusual, and I think that's unique. 
#sustainability #businessmodel #market #peripheralbusinesses 
 
KDS: Well, the barrell thing brings up an interesting--part of it is, one of my questions about the 
sustainability of this as a model, generally in the state of Virginia, I think is, is that, um, it, it 
can't maybe grow exponentially unless there are these sort of supportive markets like you're 
saying. Like, I think it's very interesting to have white oak from Virginia as part of Virginia 
wine. Like there's, there could be a mini industry there from that. And there could be mini 
indust-, like the guys that go around and do the mobile bottling, and you know, like all these 
other... 
 
Kevin: Peripheral businesses that could grow out of it. Yes. 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
21
KDS: That I think really help to make an industry, you know, have firm roots and establish and... 
you know... for the community to have ownership in it as well. It's not just somebody coming 
from outside. It's like, "Oh, this is actually something that involves all of us." 
 
Kevin: Like infrastructure, you could grow... 
KDS: Yeah. 
Kevin: ... organically... Well, I think part of the--the barrel specific challenge is that what kind of 
flavor components... 
 
KDS: Yeah. 
 
Kevin: ... is Virginia white oak and give a wine--white, red, or otherwise? 
KDS: Right. So that's all sort of an unknown quantity. 
#oak #barrels #levelsoftoast #cooperages #France #taste 
 
Kevin: It is. It is an unknown quantity. And the other thing is, you know, when you look at 
somewhere like France, you know, Napoleon, he commissioned people to plant white oak 
forests, and most of it at the time was for ship building. But these very ancient forests now 
support this massive French oak industry. And most of these big cooperages that are French have 
facilities in Napa or in California, because that's where the immediate big demand is. So they're 
pulling this dried and cured wood from the source in France, and then they're assembling. And 
even within the French, I mean I've had the same exact wine out of 7 different cooperages, and 
maybe this level of toast is slightly different and so on and so forth. But ultimately the point is, 
even the French white oak that's coming from a pretty small area can show variation. So the 
question is, what kind of flavor components are you gonna get? So these are all things that we're 
playing with. I actually think that the Virginia oak has the ability... cause most of what you see in 
our country is Missouri and Minnesota, in my experience, as far as American oak. 
 
KDS: Okay.

#barrels #oak #vanilla #winenotes #flavors #blends 
 
Kevin: And they tend to communicate a bigger vanilla note something a little bit brawny, a little 
bit more massive. You tend to get more coconut and dill and eucalyptus--these kinds of 
components--as opposed to caramel, coffee, baking spices, things like that. So depending on the 
varietal and depending on the oak... And that's why, you know, when we talk about blends, there 
are many ways that blends can be done. We could take the same exact wine and put in 5 different 
things and blend that back together before bottling, we could buy 3 chardonnays that have 
already been made and blend those together, and then what we store it in for how long is kind the 
touches we can put on those wines. The last would be blending different types of varietals. So a 
lot of times when we hear about people talking about Bordeaux wines, they're almost universally 
a blend of things. 
 
KDS: And so, is there like a... for the wine maker here, who would be the main wine maker? 
00:33:21 
#winemaker #French #LoireValley #Burgundy #MarinCounty 
 
Kevin: It's a Frenchman named Benoit. And our winemaker just transitioned from a gentlemen 
named Tim Crow, and he was here for about 4 years, and he's a Californian for Marin County 
and Benoit was born in the Loire Valley and studied in Burgundy. 
 
KDS: Benoit? 
 
Kevin: Benoit, B-E-N-O-I-T, Benoit. 
KDS: Is that last name? First? 
Kevin: First name. 
KDS: First name. 
Kevin: Yeah, and people call him Ben for short. 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
23
 
KDS: Okay. 
 
Kevin: He's only been part of our project here now for about 6 weeks. 
KDS: Oh, very new. Yeah. 
#Monticello #MichelRoland #consultant 
 
Kevin: Yeah, and, he's really talented and he worked [...] in the sort of Monticello corridor. 
Great wines, great wines. We're very, very excited to have him here. Also, we have a 
consultancy, that's another layer. Michel Roland, very famous consultant. 
 
KDS: Michel--a man or a woman? 
 
Kevin: It's a man--so it's M-I-C-H-E-L, Michel. Roland--R-O-L-A-N-D, I believe. Michel 
Roland. And if you look him up, he's got a massive CV. 
 
KDS: Where's he based out of? 
 
Kevin: Well, he's based out Bordeaux. I wanna say he's kind of a Right Bank specialist from like 
St. Emilion and Pomerol, which is on the right side of the river, but he's worked all over the 
world, and he's got some projects here in Bor-- I mean in Virginia too. I think Boxwood... I think 
he work with Boxwood maybe. He's a big personality kind of consultant. He puts a real sort of 
stamp on what he does. And what we've done is we brought him on as someone to kind of 
oversee. We'll make all the final decisions. He's not gonna say, "Do this." We're gonna ask him 
for his advice, but we're gonna have the final say in how we craft these wines, but it's just 
another layer of sort of quality control and conceptual sort of... 
 
00:35:22 
KDS: Yeah, so how involved would you say Mike and Kristi [the owners] are? Is it something 
where they're tasting things along the way, or they like, "You guys are the experts and we're just 
gonna enjoy what you make"? 
 
#life/workbalance #owners #involvement #family 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
24
Kevin: Yeah, so they're actually very involved. They used to live right on the land and they 
bought a home like 2 minutes away that's been renovated. So whenever there is a blending or a 
blinding kind of panel, Mike's involved and their daughter, Lacy Huber is our Vice president, 
and she too will sit in on these tastings. So frequently what they'll do is they'll make an a, b, c, d, 
e, f, g blend of something with different percentages of things in there. And they'll just have 
them in decanters, and you won't know what's what. And so you’re unbiased, at least, hopefully 
in    your approach, you're kind like, "I really like C because, wow, it has the density in the  
structure and the complexity and the layers, and it has all of these nuances going on that I really 
love." [Coughs] So sorry.  
 
KDS: That's okay. It's allergy season. 
Kevin: Everything's about to start to bloom. 
KDS: Yeah, I know. So, Lacy is the vice president of Stone Tower? 
 
#daughter #VP #art #teaching #packaging #design #learning at work #sommelier #popping corks 
#mentoring 
 
Kevin: Yes, and she's their daughter. So when you look at her background--teacher, artist, you 
know, taught art--so as far as packaging, labeling, a lot of the press is written by her, if not all of 
it. So a lot of the sort of images that are communicated and things of that nature are all coming 
from her. But she also studied and trained a lot in tasting wine and blind tasting wines, so I think 
that's part of the fun of being here, honestly, is that so many people that are on staff are doing 
blind tastings, are studying outside of work. So they're so passionate about it. They wanna know 
and learn, and they're kind of self driven, and they're creating study groups and things like that. 
And the thing about advertising, when you blind taste wines and you're trying to learn how to do 
that--if you can create a panel of 5 or 6 people and say, "Hey, it's my week, I'll buy those 5 
wines, and I'll pour them for you, and I know what they are, but you won't." That allows you to 
get access to a lot more great wine for a lot less, and then you can all share the feedback with one 
another live as you go through the process. So it helps. And so there are many, many, many 
aspects of, I think, what makes this specific property great and fun, but just when you look at 
wine tasting and being a sommelier on the floor in a restaurant or popping corks, you know, 
doing whatever, there's all these different layers to it, but some of the fun is when you really dive 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017

into being a sommelier. I never personally wanted to test with the court. My mentor Raj that I 
mentioned earlier, he never tested with the court, but he trained with a lot of masters. 
 
00:38:25 
KDS: Yeah, and that's a very particular, grueling slog to have to go through. 
Kevin: He's a life long fan. 
KDS: Yeah, let me just check in how I'm doing with my question list. What other questions I 
have--so as we said, there's all different kinds of winery-vineyard setups throughout the state of 
Virginia: really tiny little barn counter ones, and really elaborate places. How would you 
describe Stone Tower to anyone who is not able to see it for point of comparison? What are the 
different things that you do here? What's the big picture of Stone Tower? It's a big vineyard. 
 
00:39:11 
#facility size #grafting #vines #vineyard #time on vines #time in barrels #winery 
 
Kevin: Yeah, it's a big facility, and I think our long term goals are to get over 100 acres of 
vineyard in the ground. You're basically buying a grafted combination from a nursery. So you're 
ordering the root stock and the buying stock grafted together in a very specific combination. The 
nursery grows that. So you're putting a yearling in the ground. Now you're then looking at 2 to 3 
years in the ground before you're getting good yields from whites. You're looking at 3 to 4 years 
in the ground before you get good yields of reds, and then we put these wines in barrel. Most of 
our whites are 10 to 12 months in oak, if we're gonna do that. And most of our reds are 16 to 23 
months in oak, so you're kind of looking at a 5-to-8-year window from when you say "Go." So 
part of the reason we have 2 labels is so we can grow the estate program but have lots of 
wonderful wines to offer along the way. It also helps capitalize that growth. So we're planting 10 
to 12 new acres every year, and our long term goal is to get to 100. Now if we have 100 acres of 
fully mature vines here, we would be one of the probably top 10 largest facilities in the state as 
far as production. Also, we are building another production winery on our land. So the one you 
see--that you got to see--where there's large format oak and stainless steel and concrete, and is a 
very big space. It's a working winery. That is a real working space, but it's also a space to 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
26
entertain at times. And we don't wanna inconvenience them when we can create another space 
that just dedicated to production and storage. 
 
KDS: That will continue to be used, but you will have also... 
 
#French varietals #Italian #nebbiolo #planting #production per acre 
 
Kevin: Another site on site--yeah. The other thing that Mike and Kristi did recently is that 
because his family property of 1200 acres surrounds this, he swapped some up-valley and down- 
valley land. And then he bought 100 acres, our 206 went to 306. And 100 that 306 is heavily 
forested, so we're in the process of clearing a little bit of tree, some of these aspects that are 
perfect. We're clearing some of the trees away. Some of that will be some of the oak we use for 
barrels if we get that opportunity. But as far as what we do and what I think's unique, we make 
dry wines--what we be considered Burgundian and Bordelais. You know, like, of Burgundy and 
of Bordeaux. We get a lot of requests for sweet wines and fruit ones, but ultimately, we're more 
traditional in our focus. The bulk of what we planted here, 60% is red varietals, and it's mostly 
cab franc, merlot, and cabernet sauvignon. The 40% that's white--the bulk of that is chardonnay 
and sauvignon blanc, and it's because of how vigorously those grow compared to others. And 
we've got some small blocks pinot noir and nebbiolo. Nebbiolo's the only sort of Italian varietal 
that we have on vine. Everything else is French in its origins. The first thing is, lots of people 
have vineyards, and they're beautiful to look at, and they're in this really beautiful view and this 
bucolic setting, but they've never really been focused on the quality of the wine, or they're trying 
to ramp up how much they release. You know what I'm saying? You have a lot of control out 
there--how much yield you want per acre. And a lot of the growers that are selling fruit in some 
of these wines--some of these wineries--they're trying to get 3 or 4 tons an acre. For us, we've 
been doing a ton of 3 quarters to a ton and a half an acre. Part of that is just pruning away, 
trimming away like green harvesting, dropping fruit to the ground. A lot of people do this... and 
it's what's gonna intensify what remains. It's gonna make better what you have. That's pristine 
and that's still on the vine. 
 
KDS: It also increases your upfront costs a bit. 
 
00:43:27 
#beautiful location #wine quality #focus #events #weddings #expansion #staff education 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017

Kevin: It certainly can, and... and the thing is that we could put Stone Tower packaging on all 
these wines, whether they are from our property or not, whether it's wine we bought 10 minutes 
away, whether it's fruit we bought from somewhere else. Mike and Kristi from the very 
beginning, wanted to differentiate what was estate and what wasn't, and their focus was always 
on the estate. So regardless of how beautiful the property is and how big the facility is, and all 
these cool spaces to come hang out, their focus was always the quality of the wine. And I think 
that is unique. I think that to spend the money and the energy and the time to make great estate 
wines from the very beginning of having the property--that's not everybody's focus. And I'm not 
trying to criticize others. I'm just trying to say, some people, they wanna have a beautiful space 
to cater weddings, and they've got some vineyards planned out there, and it looks pretty, but 
they're not pulling any quality fruit from it. That's not their focus. Some people, wine is the 
whole focus. 
 
00:44:30 
KDS: Do you guys do a lot of events? I mean this would have to be really big events going on 
here, I'm assuming. 
 
Kevin: We do a lot, and see where we are now--rooms like this can handle 40 to 50 people. We'll 
say you can do a rental for the day or the afternoon or whatever--hourly or whatever. But we've 
got lots of rooms that you can... 
 
KDS: So you can have something going on while it's still open to the public? 
 
#barrel club #wedding #multi-use 
 
Kevin: Yeah. These spaces could--like if someone's got a wedding here, the whole downstairs 
that you got a chance to walk through would be closed in the afternoon. So a lot of those spaces 
you got to walk through the other day. So the library and the barrel club and where all the... we 
have, what 400 barrels in those 2 cellars and the ballroom--all these places would be dedicated to 
the wedding. So no one would be down there except for them. 
 
00:45:10 
KDS: Oh, okay. So that's different than a lot of... Cause a lot of facilities... 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
28
 
Kevin: Just having a venue to do that, of that size... 
 
KDS: ... if they wanna have a wedding, they have to close down to the public because they only 
have the one space. 
 
Kevin: Exactly, and that's the thing. So every once in a long while someone'll rent the whole 
barn, so we can shut for that and kind of transition to that, you know, whatever. But ultimately, 
and I think we'll continue to build more celebration spaces so that people won't overlap. But the 
focus is really customer service. And regardless of what it is, whether it's an event, a wedding, a 
tasting at the bar, a tour like we did the other day, it's really about being aware and sensitive of 
the client and the customer and giving them an experience that they can't get everywhere else, 
right. And I think that that's kind of the fun part of it. I mean a lot of places--even in California-- 
someone's gonna say, here's a little white wine, here's a little red wine. You start asking some 
really detailed questions, what kind of answers are you gonna get? For us, education is really 
critical here for all of our tasting staff. And we try and explain to people, if you don't know the 
answer, don't tell someone something that's not true. Come find someone who might. I think for 
us, the combination of the property itself, which is really gorgeous, lots of areas to hang out that 
are different, having lots of different wine options that are all of quality--if you're just a person 
who likes dry rosés, we're gonna have a Wild Boar rosé, we're gonna have an estate rosé, and 
we're gonna have a dry sparkling rosé within the next 4 or 5 weeks. So for spring at summer, 
you're gonna have 3 rosé options. But ultimately, I think it comes down to the combination of 
really great wine, a really pretty property, and knowledgeable, caring staff. And I always tell 
people, I can't teach caring. You either have that in you or you do not. So I could give you a 
million cool facts and some really interesting in chemistry and... 
 
00:47:20 
KDS: Like you're just droning on and... 
 
Kevin: Yeah, so you gotta have people, and we've got people of all age--23 to 63--and all these 
backgrounds: people that retired and sold their businesses and kids that are just out of college 
trying to figure out what direction they're going. And so everyone brings something different to 
the party, and I think it's dynamic and it's fun. 
 
KDS: And how many people just work... 
Kevin: Behind the bars? 
KDS: Yeah.

Kevin: Roughly 75. So we have about 115 employees. So would you take office employees, the 
management team--these are your 9 to 5ers Monday through Friday, and then your management 
team's working when we're working, right. And then the vineyard crew's probably about 12 to 
15, and then you've got all these different tasting associates that kind of fill in. And kind of plug 
in here and there. 
 
KDS: So a lot of people do it part time and on the weekend. 
 
00:48:13 
Kevin: Yeah. It's like, oh, you know, "I'm a teacher. I get paid year-round, but I got summers off 
from the job. Why not supplement that a little bit. Maybe take a vacation. Whatever. Yeah. So 
nurses that are 3 days on, 4 days off. Whatever. You know, it's like, hey, this is a fun 
environment. 
 
KDS: Yeah, and it's an extra job and it's not laborious like a restaurant--I mean was that part of 
the appeal for you as well? 
 
Kevin: Absolutely. 
 
KDS: Cause that's grueling. It can be tough. 
 
Kevin: Well, I can tell you to, you know, being 52 years young, and having been in the industry 
since I was almost 17/18 years old on and off--almost 30-35 years. You know, on one level, the 
environment is stressful and the farther you go up that fine dining ladder, perfection is sort of the 
minimum. But you do get to be with those crazy chefs, and they're throwing plates against the 
wall, and they're threatening to stab you, and they're breaking stuff, and they're psychotic, but 
they're also incredibly hard working. They're inspired. They're genius. But they're a little bit 
megalomaniacal sometimes. But just the physical wear and tear. Being on your feet 30-35 years 
for 8, 10, 12 hours a day. 
 
KDS: And working with everyone else is out having fun.

#localfood #farmer 
 
Kevin: That's right. Yeah, you're like, "Oh, it's Thanksgiving. Well, we're gonna have a thousand 
people today." It's like, oh, when you're at home, having turkey with family. You know, for me, 
that's what I like about it. It's a nice in time. It's a nice out time. And I still get a lot of interaction 
with a lot of different people. I get to talk to a lot of different people, answer questions, you 
know. And my style of service as a server was always very informational. You know, like, if you 
know where this farm, where this dish came from, that farmer, if you know that this bottle was 
made by that one maker on that piece of land--and more local is always cool to me. But 
ultimately for me, that's what connects you to that experience. So the more connection you have 
to what's going on, the more it'll kind of ground you, and if that was a special meal and a special 
wine, then you turned me onto something I never would have tried or I never would have known 
about--those are the things I think that make it fun. 
 
00:50:34 
#Hogback Mountain 
 
KDS: I think one of the things that's interesting too is the connection--like I had always heard 
about things being referred to Hogback Mountain around here. But when I was on the tour with 
you, you were the one who explained how it actually looks like a boar, like a wild boar back or 
something like that I think. 
 
Kevin: Well, basically when you're down-valley and you kinda look back. The silhouette here is 
sort of the shape of a hog's back. That may have been named that after the Civil War, and there 
may not have been any trees cause they burned it all down. It might really look like a hog back, 
but it's just been called that a very long time, and it's just the name of this area, but you come off 
of Hogback Rd. off 15 to get up here. 
 
KDS: Yeah, but I think that's something... there's a... I don't think this is an actual word, but 
there's a placed-ness about wineries that is really interesting, like what you're talking about, 
being able to taste what's from here, the terroir of here, but it's also drawing attention to the 
beautiful landscape, the historical places that... You know what I mean? The whole space sort of 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017

benefits, or it gets... maybe it has a deeper significance for people because their favorite winery 
is there, and you can see this mountain from it, and you can see that, and you're right near this 
and that.

#bias #Virginia wine #snobs #California #fruit-forward #New World #Old World #wine 
characteristics #drinkability #Barboursville #petit verdot 
 
Kevin: Well, I also think that you're fighting a pretty powerful bias against Virginia wine. A lot 
of native Virginians, they want to love these wines, and they want them to be of quality. You get 
a lot of people from everywhere else, and they don't really believe that Virginia can make great 
wine. So either have someone who's just wholeheartedly trying to support every Virginia winery 
they can, and they're willing to go to lots of them to find the best. And then you've got people 
from California that come out and go, "[Scoffs] Whatever." And that's what I find really fun, too, 
is that I've got a lot of friends that are sommeliers like in Miami or New York or Chicago or LA 
or Spago or in San Francisco, whatever, where I was working for years, and I blind taste them on 
wines, like, from here at Stone Tower. And this brings up a point that's really important because, 
what I talked about earlier--if you smell and you taste fruit first, that's probably a New World 
wine. That's probably something that was created not from Western Europe. You get all these 
non-fruit characteristics, you're talking about something that's probably from the Old World. 
Well, I think not many people can do it here in Virginia, but I would say 3 to 5% can make these 
really tremendous estate wines, whether they be white or red or red blends that will give you 
some of that New World fruit you expect, but a whole bunch of non-fruit characteristics that is so 
coveted in European wine. We have two different estate Bordeaux blends--like we talked about 
Right and Left Bank examples. One's a little softer and more velvety and kind of elegant and 
pretty, and maybe more approachable, but concentrated, and that's the Windswept Hill. But you 
got to try the Hogback Mountain the other day, and that one is 70% cabernet sauvignon. That's 
basically our Left Bank example of here. Now, both Windswept and the Hogback, these are age- 
worthy wines. We're talking the Windswept's probably a 7-10-year drinkability window, and the 
Hogback's probably 10 to 15. So you could lay these wines down and you could go back to them 
in a decade or so. And obviously the complexion and the character of these ones will have 
shifted. Some of the fruit will a change, and it'll become more earth. But I'm just telling you that 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
32
it's rare to taste and smell fruit and then get all this cedar and tobacco and leather and smoke, and 
all this earth, all this forest floor, these wet leaves. I'm just saying, it's hard to find any wine that 
has these New World and Old World characteristics combined. And I think that's something that 
makes Virginia very special, and I've had the privilege to try a lot of the best of Virginia, 
especially in the Bordeaux blends. You know your Barboursville Octagons; Jim law with his 
Hardscrabble, and his Avenius, and his Blesso reds; and Jeff White at Glenn Manor doing his 
Hotter Hill--these Bordeaux blends. And I honestly think--as a little caveat--cab franc has been 
widely planted in the red world of Virginia because it's the first to ripen in that whole family of 
Bordeaux varietals. But I see petit verdot actually being a Bordeaux varietal that can really make 
a major impact for Virginia. And I'll give you an example. Last year's Governor's Case--and the 
Governor's Case is 4 Whites and 8 reds--5 of the 8 reds were petit verdots. 
 
00:55:31 
KDS: Oh really? 
 
#weather #planting risks #varietals #hardiness #hurricanes 
 
Kevin: And there weren't many... Not a lot of people have planted that varietal because it's the 
last one to ripen. And our concern in Virginia is getting good, good, ripe fruit, right? And the 
closer we get to harvest, the more volatile the fruit is, and the more vulnerable the fruit is, and 
then we're volatile the weather gets. You get these hurricane patterns of fire up on the eastern 
seaboard, hale, frost, derechos, polar vortexes. Literally, there's a whole litany of things that 
could go wrong. It could be very devastating. 
 
KDS: So that's the appeal of doing cab franc is that you can bring it in before... 
 
00:56:05 
Kevin: Hopefully, hopefully you can get... Hopefully can get good ripe fruit early enough that 
you can make wine. And all these others, they're just kinda hanging out there. Well, PV is the 
last to ripen. I mean, in French, you know, green... "Petit verdot," that means "little green." 
 
KDS: Yeah, I feel like a lot of people lost, maybe in 2011, when there was all that rain--did they 
lose? I don't know. There was one year I feel like recently where... 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
33
Kevin: Well, there was a vintage that a series of hurricanes back to back to back had us under 
cloud cover. And most--I'd say 25 or 30 days full of rain. So no sunlight, but also way too much 
moisture and the plants just pull all that in, and it just destroys everything. It's devastating. 
Devastating. It's remarkable because '17 is just the opposite of that. In that we had hurricanes line 
up in the Caribbean, destroying Puerto Rico, everything, and just lining up to just hammer us one 
after the other. 
 
KDS: But they stayed out. 
 
#forecasts #weather #diurnal shift #bumper crop #viognier #cabernet franc #Norton 
 
Kevin: Yeah. We're literally talking 5 forecasts I saw in one day said there's a 100% chance on 
all 5. And then one went out to the open Atlantic and one went to Tennessee. And guess what? 
We had 7 weeks of dry, moderate, amazing weather, bumper crop--probably the most bumper 
crop Virginia's had. I mean, when I looked back historically about quality yields, you know, like 
'07, '09, '99--I mean years where they got these really great yields. But I think '17 is gonna 
surpass all that as far as just quality fruit production. Those stats may or may not be available, 
but that's based on what all my friends and all that we've discussed historically in Virginia--well 
the last like 30 years. Anyway, so there are many concerns and challenges. But the one thing that 
we do have in our favor in Virginia is that there's a term called "diurnal shift", and that's a 
temperature swing between night and day, and you go somewhere like California, a lot of parts 
of California. The down shirt is pretty significant, where if you're at elevation near the ocean or 
in these areas where you have some maritime influences, the swings can be pretty wild, so the 
plants will shut down. So they have a lot more time to get good, ripe fruit. But ultimately, it's the 
kind of situation where they've got more time to get ripe fruit, but they need it because the plant 
starts and stops, starts and stops; well for us, we have longer, warmer days into night shift, so the 
plant can actually continue to respirate a lot longer. That helps us get ripe fruit in a shorter 
window too. I just think that, historically, you look at what has dominated Virginia, you got 
viognier, you've got cab franc, you hear about the Norton grape at times. And the Norton grape 
was a grape that was created in Virginia by hybridization in 1826--Dr. Daniel Norton, I believe, 
and Todd Climen wrote book about it called The Wild Vine if you wanna really dive into that. 
 
KDS: Yeah.

00:59:28 
#hybridization #disease #vines #wild vines #grapes 
 
Kevin: But hybridization was a big part of the 18... early 1800s and on because the vitis vinifera 
vines of Europe, when they were planted here would die in the soil, because it phylloxera. So 
you've got this microscopic agent that would eat them. And the indigenous wild vines here were 
phylloxera-resistant, but they were not wine grapes, right? 
 
KDS: Yeah. I just actually... have you seen this book by Andrew Painter? He just came out with 
a book. It's like a history of Virginia wine. It just came out, so you might not have seen it. 
 
Kevin: I heard about it, but I haven't seen it, no. 
 
00:59:58 
#growing European grapes in New World 
 
KDS: Yeah, so I just went to a book launch that he had, and the example he kept saying is like, 
all these people were coming to the New World and saying, "Look, these grapes are growing 
everywhere! Let's stick European grapes in the ground, and they'll do great!" And then they kept 
dying. And then another person would come and say... 
 
Kevin: "We can do it!" 
 
KDS: "Maybe it was because it was a Frenchman. I'm Italian; I'll do it!" Nobody knew the actual 
or microorganism that was. 
 
#Thomas Jefferson #hybridization #crop failure #grafting 
 
Kevin: Well, and Thomas Jefferson was literally the most, I wanna say the most undaunted. He 
planted over 210 different types of varietals out of Europe in our soil. Just trying to make 
anything go. And when you look at all this micro... you know, this chemistry and like all the soil 
and all that, and so there was this window of a really heavy hybridization. People kept trying to 
cross this and that and make it go, right. And then ultimately, we sent those things to Europe, and 
they started killing everything there in an agricultural exchange. 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
35
 
01:00:55 
KDS: It's nice of us to share. 
 
Kevin: Well, the solution they came up with was grafting. You saw these agricultural exchanges. 
People would send plants from all over the world, and yet you get all these invasive species that 
don't belong in all these other parts of the world and all kinds of stuff. So sometimes they were 
trying to share something, I think, come up with the cash crop or citrus or potatoes or coffee 
beans or whatever. 
 
KDS: Well because fortunes really were made. Like, even just people, farmers that would figure 
out a great tasting apple, and then they would name the apple after them. 
 
#colonial #Jamestown #alcohol #getting drunk #massive consumption #history 
 
Kevin: Or spices and all these things, just whatever became coveted in some way was a way to 
make money. And I think that... I always joke around cause Jamestown, part of their charter was, 
every man I think, had to tend 10 vines. And Virginia has a 400-year try... You know, a 
historical, like, "Let's do this." And I think that, I always joke that most colonists need alcohol. 
So the question is, obviously, you wanna make and sell and be profitable. But if you can make 
whiskey, you know, from cane sugar in the Caribbean and bring it here, or you know, corn or 
beer or whatever, these simple techniques that will go and can go, then wine goes by the 
wayside. So historically... 
 
KDS: People just wanna get drunk. 
 
Kevin: Absolutely. If you ever done any real, like serious... 
KDS: They weren't doing tastings. 
Kevin: Well, if you wanna see serious research on volume, people were drinking copious 
amounts of alcohol. Like, ridiculously so. Like, to the point where you're like, how did you get 
anything accomplished? It was reading things from the Civil War... There was a ship in the Civil 
War that attacked somewhere in Ireland, and they stole 50,000 gallons of Scotch. And in 3 weeks 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
36
it was gone. How are you drinking 50,000 gallons of Scotch? That's ridiculous. And needing 
more, like angry, like let's go down to Cuba and steal some rum. It's like, wow, that's a lot. 
 
KDS: Y'all maybe have a problem. 
 
01:03:05 
Kevin: Yeah, yeah. Well, I always make a joke that most of us are probably here one way or the 
other because of alcohol. 
 
KDS: [Laughing] God bless. Yeah, no, I think... Well, my previous work was with cider-- um, 
with orchards, apple orchards in Fauquier County. A lot of the American history and Johnny 
Appleseed and all of that was really about cider, because you needed to have cider to make a 
potable beverage because the water sources couldn't always be trusted. But if you had orchards 
planted ahead, people could move out to New Frontiers and make cider from... even if just crap 
apples, whatever they were, they didn't have to be nice eating apples, but you could make cider 
and then settlements could form. So a lot of people think of Johnny Appleseed, they think of his 
planting red delicious or something, but no, he was really just planting, like, really crap trees, but 
it was because the point was to get cider apples. 
 
01:04:01 
#alcohol saves lives #potability #drinking water #pathogens #won't spoil 
 
Kevin: Well, and the thing is, if you really got into the history of Western Europe, there's about a 
400-year window where, without beer and wine, most historians believe that Western civilization 
would have died out because the potability of the water was a serious, dangerous issue. I think 
that alcohol will kill a lot of pathogens. Right? 
 
KDS: That's what I tell myself. 
 
Kevin: I've been killing pathogens for about 35 years. But the point I'm ultimately making here is 
that without... I mean, specifically the wine--the wine bottle, the cork and the corkscrew, once 
you get the equipment to lay small amounts of wine down in a cold, dark place like a cave or 
cellar, and then you can go back to it and you can say, "Wow! 1543 is better than 1541." That's 
where we end up now in the modern world. I think that there are lots of reasons we got to where 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
37
we are now, but that's really what it was all about was being able to lay these things down. They 
wouldn't spoil. And then you could say, "Wow, that was a really great year! That vintage was 
amazing, and remember it ripened early and then finished late, and we got to hang that fruit a 
little bit longer, or whatever." 
 
01:05:21 
KDS: There's a great series, I think, Michael Pollan did on Netflix called Cooked, or I think it's 
called Cooked, but it's about how human beings developed the different methods that we 
developed for making food processable for us. So like fermentation is one of the things that they 
studied--heat, obviously, different cooking methods, and then like tending to soil. And anyway... 
 
Kevin: So it's like crop rotation, it's basically how you recondition the soil by putting fish bones 
back in the ground. You kind of fertilizing and you're... 
 
KDS: Just things like, who was the first person to eat cheese? 
Kevin: It's like, wow, they were brave. 
KDS: Exactly. It's a fascinating series. 
 
#history #British monarchy #Champagne #Dutch #Chateau Laffite Rothschild #barrels 
#amphora #white oak #foodstorage 
 
Kevin: He was pretty desperate. Yeah, I think all those things are really quite fascinating. And 
actually when you really look at spirits and wine and all these things, historically, there's just so 
much amazing history. You look at something like, from what I've read, and this is a while back, 
but Eleanor of Aquitaine, by marriage basically gave the British monarchy access to Champagne 
and what was Bordeaux for hundreds of years. They had basically control of those spaces, and 
the British were allied with the Dutch, and they brought in Dutch engineers, and those engineers 
were good at canal and levy and dam, and they drained parts of Bordeaux, and in doing so, they 
exposed this amazing strata, this sand and this gravel and stone. If someone doesn't drain the 
swamp 400 years ago, you don't have Château Laffite Rothschild. You know what I'm saying? 
You look at barrels, for thousands of years, they were using clay amphora, right? Well, you 
started seeing them use palm wood in Mesopotamia to make wooden casks, and then as the 
Romans get into Northern Europe and get into what was then called Gall--these nomadic... these 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
38
Franco and Germanic tribes were using white oak. Well, typically, if you're gonna try and make 
something out of wood, and you gotta shape it, you're gonna dry and cure it, soak it then, and 
probably heat it. So they start making these oak casks. And I'm sure what happened is that it had 
the integrity to hold liquids like olive oil, honey, water, beer, wine, whatever, in a cask format. 
But then all of a sudden people started realizing, hey, when we put this line in that barrel, it tastes 
different than when I put this wine in that ancient little cistern of concrete or that little clay pot or 
whatever. And it starts to become coveted. That's my favorite. And it's like, oh, and we're 
caramelizing the insides of these barrels with fire. Right? You know what I'm saying? 
 
01:08:20 
KDS: Do you think that that's kind of why... is that part of the mystique of... or the romance of 
winemaking, that you're basically doing something that people have done... Obviously, we have 
some modern... 
 
Kevin: But literally thousands... in some ways 8000 years. 
 
KDS: Yeah. You're participating in a very, very old tradition that you know that the Greeks and 
Romans were sitting around drinking wine and that we can do the same thing. And it's... 
 
#8000 years #history of wine #Mount Ararat #Anatolia #Bible #connection to tradition 
 
Kevin: I think it's profound on a lot of levels because I think that when you look at the genetics, 
the genome of wine grapes, they've traced it back about 8000 years, and it's to the foot of Mt. 
Ararat near Anatoly. And I find that interesting for one other reason is that, in the Bible, it says 
that Noah stepped off the Ark at the foot of Mt. Ararat and put a stick in the ground, and vines 
began to grow. It's kind of an interesting corollary there--ancient sort of story and the modern 
discovery of similar... But I think that America is such a young country, and I think that that 
gives us a lot. It gives us the freedom to do whatever we want unhindered with the ties that bind, 
when you've... your family have been in that town for 14 generations. I think that roots you and it 
grounds you, and it gives you a sense of tradition and belonging, and you are from somewhere. 
But we are a young country, and it's like, I was born and raised in California. We always used to 
joke that all the people in California were the ones that were crazy enough just to keep going 
west until they ran out of land. It was just basically, you're not tied to this history that traps you. 
You're free to become and do whatever you want. And that is, in one way, liberating. And in 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
39
some ways, you're like an untethered balloon. You don't have roots, you're not grounded in any 
true history or tradition. Now, our country's 200-plus years old, but when you're looking at 
thousands of years in these ancient cultures in Mesopotamia, Asia, and all over the world, even 
the European ones--I think sometimes, without even knowing it, wine and things like this have 
been made and consumed, and same thing with beer. These beer recipes that are so simple that 
have been codified by law going back 500 years. These do connect you with these ancient things 
that go way, way beyond our own personal history in this country. 
 
01:11:14 
KDS: Which is something I think Americans have always been looking for as well. I think that's 
why they were so desperate, like Thomas Jefferson's efforts to find a grape vine that would grow 
because they had this insecurity about being the ugly stepchild to all these European cities and 
countries that had all this great culture and... 
 
Kevin: ... And history, and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years of doing it. 
KDS: Yeah, and they always were like, "Well, we're pretty great too!" 
Kevin: "... But we just can't do wine here." 
KDS: Yeah. 
#Virginia like Britain #horse country #fox hunts #English style countryside #landed gentry 
 
Kevin: But I also think too, to me being a native Northern Californian, and lived all over Alaska, 
Texas, and seeing many of our states, the Fox and Hound, that sort of club part of this world-- 
Virginia, that's like Britain. You may have gotten your independence and you may have broken 
off and said, "We're gonna die or die trying. We're gonna win or die trying," you know. But 
there's still all Fox and Hound, and they're all in hunt club and they're now. And it's the clothing, 
and it's the buildings, and it's everything about it. And so to me, that too, whether they're aware 
of it or not, is trying to be connected in some way... 
 
KDS: ... to something more old and noble... 
 
Kevin: ... and more ancient. Absolutely. 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
40
 
KDS: Yeah. It is a funny thing around here... I think that there were some old families who were 
like, "Oh, I don't know that we necessarily wanna go with these rebels." 
 
Kevin: Oh, I think there were lots of people on the fence. 
KDS: Yeah. And they're like... 
Kevin: I kinda like Virginia like this. I kinda like that British way of doing stuff. 
 
KDS: And they have the most to lose because I know some of them were gifted land by the King 
and all this... 
 
Kevin: Yeah, exactly. 
 
KDS: And they were like, "Yeah, that's not great for me." 
Kevin: Oh yeah, it's not good at all, exactly. 
KDS: They're still like that when they talk about blocking developments and doing all these 
things, you still have a lot of that--well, more in Fauquier than here. 
 
Kevin: And I lived in Gainesville, and I was in Rappahanock, and you see all these different 
socio-economic systems that sort of play out. Rappahanock is one animal, and then Loudoun is a 
whole other. All these areas in the Monticello, whatever. They all have their own kind of 
personalities, I think. 
 
KDS: It's wild. 
 
Kevin: And political. 
 
KDS: So where do you see the future of the Virginia wine industry going.

Kevin: Well, I think that it is its own sort of unique thing. It really is. I think that you're gonna 
have more and more people trying to build facilities, but I don't know if the focus is gonna be on 
quality estate wines like we're talking about. I see a little more in the short run, more people are 
trying to build a beautiful tasting room in a beautiful space to entertain people on a really 
beautiful ridgeline with a great view of the valley and all this and all that. The point is to really 
make serious world class wines. It's a big, long, long play. It's a long-term commitment, and it's a 
long view, and it requires deep pockets and vision... 
 
#Kluge #Trump #overspending 
 
KDS: Even more than that, too, is just reading the history of the Kluge Estate, which is now the 
Trump vineyard, winery, whatever it's called. 
 
Kevin: Kluge? 
 
KDS: Yes, Kluge. And I guess it's a joke in the industry, like, "Don't Kluge it." Don't mess it up 
by just overdoing it or over spending on it. 
 
Kevin: Yeah. That's a pretty tough euphemism, but basically it's my understanding that her 
husband was a billionaire and he passed, and she inherited it, money. Big money. And then she 
spent a couple hundred million dollars on this facility. 
 
KDS: She spent a lot. 
 
Kevin: And then she tried to sell it for 150 million, and I think Trump bought it in foreclosure for 
about 6 million. 
 
KDS: 6, yeah, I think 6.2. And then he got the house for like another 6, I think. 
 
Kevin: Yeah, so what I would say is they made great wines too on this land, and they had some 
beautiful sparkling wines. And I think one of the reasons he purchased it was to have really great 
Virginia, American... 
 
KDS: Oh, the facilities too were amazing. 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017

Kevin: Right. And I think for his resorts and golf courses in hotels, I think he was like, this is 
American made bubbly. That's good. And I can make it on my property. And so anyway. But 
yeah, I think that when I was in California though years before I moved here, there was always a 
joke that the fastest way to make a small fortune out of a big one is to open a winery. Because 
the investment in the land alone is like a million dollars an acre, so people were debating on 
whether to build a home or have an acre of vine. [Coughs] Sorry. 
 
KDS: That's okay. Everything is out right now. 
Kevin: It's all just starting to bloom. 
01:16:10 
KDS: Okay. We've talked for some time. I don't wanna monopolize your time. It's almost 7. Are 
you gonna be... Are they gonna lock you in? Are they gonna lock us in? 
 
Kevin: Well, they'll come up here before they lock it. Yeah. If you have more you wanted to go 
over. I think they've got a big event here, and I see several of the management team's still here. 
Including some of the owners. So we're not getting locked in yet. 
 
KDS: Just to wrap up, if there's anything that you particularly wanna add feel free, but also I just 
wanted to ask, what for you is the favorite part of your work here? And also maybe what do you 
not enjoy as much?

#Comparing Virginia to Napa 30 years ago #RobertMondavi #success #risk #investment 
 
Kevin: Well, what I would say, first of all, is that... I don't know, I'm just trying to think about 
this real quick. One thing I was gonna say just about the Virginia wine world in general, cause I 
do feel like there are certain aspects of it, though are very much like Napa, say 30-35 years ago. 
And what happened in that environment were a couple important things. Mondavi built a huge 
thing. And it was at a time when the economy was depressed and no one was thinking about 
Winery Workers in Virginia

investing any money in something like that. And he was sort of like, "Build it and they will 
come," and it really did that. 
 
KDS: And he was the Kluge at the time, I guess, or... 
 
Kevin: But he became a multi-billionaire. The point is he didn't "Kluge it". He actually became 
rather successful at a time when everyone's like, you're out of your mind. Don't do this. It's a bad 
idea. And so my concerns would be more about this climate and just winemaking globally. 
Global warming, I think, is a thing. And I think that people can say whatever they like, but I 
think that up until this winter, the previous 4 winters were warmer than the one before it. And 
you start seeing about these varietals in specific places that may do really well right now, but if it 
continues to warm or continues to cool or whatever happens one way or the other, because it's 
such a long view to get yields. And I start thinking about these things... You've gotta have this 
trending ability that you kind of adapt to the... 
 
KDS: A plant today might not viable in 3 years. 
 
#fight wine bias #experience #try new things #new to wine 
Kevin: Absolutely. So just as just sort of an aside there, and for me, what's really exciting about 
being here is it's really getting to meet people and talk to people. And because those biases are 
really so powerful. It doesn't matter whether someone says, I hate chardonnay, or I don't drink 
Virginia rosés, or whatever. What we're constantly trying to do is just give people a nice 
comfortable opportunity, a place that feels safe to learn about wine, to ask questions, to try wines 
you never would have tried. I can't tell you how many times I've had people come to this winery 
that have never been to a winery anywhere. They have never even had a glass of wine. 
KDS: Wow!

Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017

Kevin: They're like, "I'm bourbon and beer. I like margaritas. I like sweet drinks that are fruity." 
Whatever. I'm just surprised by that. But coming from the Bay Area with all that proximity to so 
much wine and all the restaurants have so many choices, you just get an education just by going 
there. So for me, it's really about demystifying wine. One of the things that I talk about the most 
is that whatever job you do, most of them have a very specific type of lingo. You've got a 
vernacular. If you're an attorney, if you're a doctor, if you're a dentist, whatever you’re a CPA-- 
you've got a language, and you can use that to make people feel really stupid and exclude them, 
or you can teach them and make it very inclusive. 
KDS: Right. 
01:20:34 
#"I don't like Virginia wine." #passion #contagious 
 
Kevin: So for me personally, what I love the most about being here is I was always taught that I 
should care for everyone as though they were in my house. So I wanna have that same exact 
openness, and regardless of who someone might be, I wanna answer questions and be open and 
be inclusive, and I want to communicate maybe some difficult concepts in a way that's 
approachable, and I feel like I get a chance to do that. And for me that's very rewarding because 
if you've got an idea, "I don't drink white wine, I don't drink red wine, I don't like Virginia wine," 
I try and couch these things in a way that gets them willing to try, and then maybe they're like, 
"Oh my goodness, this one is really quite good. I never would have tried the chardonnay, but 
wow!" So it's really just about trying to illuminate and do things that are inclusive, and I think 
you can tell that I have a lot of enthusiasm and a lot of passion for what I do. So I think that too 
is a little bit contagious for people. So for me, everything I try and turn back inward to share with 
others, and to give them a frame of reference, and how did we get here, and where we are, and 
why... 
 
KDS: You make them as excited about it as you are.

Kevin: Ultimately, brand ambassadors are here to tell you the story. So I can tell you this story 
about the property and the land and the family and wine, but I can tell a lot of different types of 
stories. So the question is, I get to be a storyteller in an area that I really love at a time... I would 
say it's a very exciting time to be at Stone Tower in its evolution that started 16 years ago, but it's 
a very exciting time to be in the Virginia wine world, because I think not everybody can make 
world class wines, but we are... I'll try and very quickly tell you this story, but there's a very, very 
famous British wine expert named Steven Spurrier, just like the football coach. 
 
KDS: You say that as if I'll know the football coach! [Laughs] 
 
01:22:44 
#Bottleshock movie #1976 #blind tasting #A Judgement in Paris 
 
Kevin: Well but maybe someone who's listening might, but he was a coach for Florida football 
and North Carolina, and a very famous guy in the South. And this is a very different animal. So 
Steven Spurrier, now, in his early 70s... There's a very famous book called A Judgment in Paris. 
And there was kind of a poor example of a film called Bottleshock, which isn't very accurate, 
unfortunately. But the point is, in 1976, Steven went to Napa, he bought chardonnays and 
Bordeaux blends. He took them back to Paris, and he invited the who's who of the French wine 
world to blind taste American wines versus French, and the French chose America. So they 
chose Chateau Montelena chardonnay, thinking it was sort of like Puligny-Montrachet, whatever. 
Chalone chardonnay was part of that on the white side. They chose Stag's Leap SLB, Ridge 
Monte Bello, Freemark Abby, Myacamas. Anyway, Steven Spurrier had a dinner in 
Charlottesville about 2 and a half months ago. 
 
KDS: Oh, cool.

Kevin: And I got to attend that dinner. What was interesting was the Hubers that own Stone 
Tower, they know the family that own Veritas winery, where the dinner was being held. So I was 
chatting with Lacy, and I said, would you like me to bring some wines to your friends? And she 
said, "Yeah, an estate sauvignon blanc, a Hogback Mountain, and a petit verdot." 3 estate wines. 
We have this beautiful decorative box. I loaded a 3 pack. And then, I said to her, "Would you 
like me to give a 3-pack to Steven Spurrier?" And she said, "Absolutely." I went down there in a 
group of 8 of my friends from the wine world, and I'm on a Virginia wine forum with about 1000 
members. My friend Ron Crouse runs the Virginia Wine Industry forum. It's all industry folk. 
And we were all together cause we were super excited to meet Steven Spurrier. Anyway, so I 
gave him a box of these wines, and I said, "This is a sauvignon blanc. It's 10% semillon. We did 
it like a white Bordeaux. This is a Bordeaux blend, and it's Left Bank, mostly cab. And this is 
about 90% petit verdot." He said, "Hey, I'm going down to Charlottesville in South Carolina to 
see a friend of mine professionally. He has one of the finest pallets I've ever seen of 50 years, 
and we'll drink these wines together." I'm like, "That's wonderful." So I'd given all my business 
cards to my compatriots, and so I didn't even have a business card to give him, but I told them 
where we were located, and then he asked me a few questions. And then that was that. 
Tremendous meal, 8-course meal, 9 wines. He chose all of them from around the globe. It was 
really beautiful stories, special person, you just not gonna... He's probably... We wouldn't even 
be doing what we're doing here at Stone Tower, much less anywhere in Virginia, and plus who 
knows what in California. Like this was such a watershed moment. It didn't legitimize American 
wine to the French. But what it did do is legitimize the world's concept that, wow, world class 
wines can come from somewhere else, not Europe. It was always like it had to be Italian, it had 
to be French, and it had to be Spanish, Portuguese, German, whatever. So he showcased to the 
world that we can make world class wine. Okay. So in my head, I'm thinking myself, I wouldn't 
be here in Virginia doing why I wouldn't be... 
 
01:26:06 
KDS: Right. It wouldn't be anything. 
 
#Governor's Cup #wine prize 
Kevin: I wouldn't be doing any of this. It just wouldn't be what it is if this one individual had not 
chosen to do that. Anyway, so he then emailed this back a week later, and he's a guest judge on 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
47
the Governor's Cup panel when he's in country. He's been a judge on the Governor's Cup final 
panel of about 12-13 people maybe 5 or 6 times for sure. Well, he was a judge this year. 
Anyway, very quickly, he says, "I would have given your sauvignon blanc a 92 out of 100. It 
was a highest score I gave. It was higher than any score I gave any white that I judged the entire 
year." He then said, "The Petit Verdot I would've given a 94 out of 100, and the Hogback I 
would have given a 95 out of 100, the 2 highest course I gave any wine--one was a Meritage, and 
one was a Petit Verdot were 93s." So he says, "In summation, I would have given all 3 of your 
wines, the 3 highest scores of the entire Governor's cup. And he said, when I come back to the 
US, I wanna come visit you." 
KDS: Wow. 
01:27:10 
#work experiences #job satisfaction #love the chaos #buzz 
 
Kevin: So these are the types of experiences I get to have. These are the types of folks I get to 
go talk to and go meet, and I'm just proud of everything we've done here and everything we're 
doing. So, there's so many different layers to what I love about this, but coming from a restaurant 
background, you're a person that if you're gonna do it that long and you're gonna really enjoy it 
and love it, you've gotta love people, and you've gotta care about people. But you've also gotta 
like to be in the chaos and the trenches and some wineries are quieter, and some are not. I can 
walk into this winery when there are thousand people here, and I'm comfortable. Because it's like 
Lollapalooza, but it's like a concert. Right? But I'm still like, hey, there's a buzz. There's stuff 
going on. And there's amazing wines here, and this property is cool. Now, if there's a group of... 
and we've made the size of our groups much smaller that we allow on property, and you have to 
have table reservations, and there are people monitoring this, and we're doing glass and bottle 
service and so on. But there was a time back in the day where a 20-person bachelorette party can 
roll up, and they've been to 2 other wineries, and that's not fun, and that's not pretty because 
these young ladies are trashed, and they don't care... 
 
KDS: And they're puking in your planters. 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
48
Kevin: Yeah, and who knows what else is happening. And I can tell you that every once in a 
while it's like Stone Tower Gone Wild. So I'm just saying, we now have a lot of those things 
more contained, and we're more aware, and we're always trying to improve the experience for 
everybody, not just a few. So we're trying to mitigate our concerns in these areas and protect 
people from drinking and driving, and all kinds of stuff. So there's a lot of things about this that 
you have to be really serious about and really pay attention and focused about, and we also want 
people to have a great time. We're trying to balance that, share this beautiful property and give 
you some great knowledge, and... 
 
KDS: We need to get a wine train set up. We need a wine train I think. 
Kevin: We're gonna have to lay the tracks, I think. Have to choose the route. 
KDS: That would be pretty amazing though. 
 
01:29:21 
#expansion #facilities #vineyards #venue #family 
 
Kevin: Oh it would be... That would be... yeah, that would be amazing. But I think for us, we're 
gonna continue to do a little more building on this big 306 acres to produce more wine of quality 
and store more wine of quality here. And then I could see us maybe having another venue that's 
just dedicated for weddings so that maybe we can then use all of this over here--instead of 
having that downstairs off-limits sometimes. It would be nice to have those spaces open. You 
know, like, year round, day-to-day, right. I don't know how this property is going to evolve, but I 
think that the family is incredibly generous, and they're visionary and they've taken a lot of what 
has come out of the success of the winery and flipped it right back into it, and just continue to 
make it better. And because they have furniture stores, they get great furniture. But they're just-- 
their eye and their aesthetic, and what's in their heart, I think is what drives it all. It starts at the 
top. And I've just too often seen people micromanaged in any business, in any job, right into the 
round, and it'll just kill your enthusiasm and your passion. It'll just ruin what's so wonderful 
about whatever it is, and what I love about the Hubers is they really allow us to be what we're 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017

good at. They let us do what we love to do, and they let us, and they trust us enough to do it. And 
that's it. It's all about trust. 
 
01:30:46 
KDS: Honestly, that's something I've heard again and again from, from the bigger operations 
that are working well, that you are happy. It's because the family or whatever, and they all have 
different levels of involvement. But like I spoke with Sebastian Marquet at Greenhill, and he's 
very happy, and the staff is all very happy there because the owner is completely hands off but 
gives them tons of money. So whenever they need, he does it, and he's like, okay, do... Make it 
nice, make a nice wine, and just step away. So they're very happy there, and they have a good 
working relationship and say that, um, at Cana, the family is a lot more hands on, but when it 
comes to the winemaking decisions and what's gonna be planted where and whatever, they leave 
it up to their winemaker, and they're vineyard manager, and they're just like, "You guys, that's 
what you do, but we're happy to help out with whatever we can do." So I think those kind of... 
and these are all people that have been very successful in business already. 
 
01:31:57 
#winemakers like chefs #vision #quality #talent 
 
Kevin: And I think they understand that that is a very important tenet. That's just. But there's so 
many risks and there's all this what to plant where. You know. That's the one thing I'll say about 
winemakers is, they're a lot like signature chefs. Everyone's different, but you need to have a 
very confident vision and unwavering sense of... and that's the thing that sometimes you can 
overstep, right? It's like these chefs that are brilliant. Okay. Yeah. But they're not really work 
with... or maybe they're really great at creating food, but their budget numbers are horrible, or 
their labor numbers are awful, or... So being that all-encompassing like, "Man, I can make great 
food fast, and my staff is happy and manage them." These are things that make them that much 
more coveted. But I'm just saying that the sense of vision and the sense of unwavering, like... this 
is how it must be. There's a lot of that. You see that in musicians and entertainers and you see 
that in chefs. And I think that there's a good close correlation there of really great winemakers, 
and they don't really wanna hear it from anybody else. They wanna do what they wanna do the 
way they wanna do it. And that's really, typically what makes them quite great at it. But you can't 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017

throw the baby out with the bathwater. So finding someone who's really talented and then also 
has that great personality that people love to work with, and those are the things that are just 
ideal and the things that you really wanna seek out and search for. 
 
01:33:44 
KDS: Yeah. Awesome. Is that good? Are we really wrap, do you think? 
 
Kevin: Yeah. Unless... 
 
KDS: I know you could probably talk more, couldn't you? I don't wanna keep you here until it's 
night fall. But if there's anything that you wanna add. 
 
#geology #strata #Virginia #Napa #Bordeaux #Morocco 
 
Kevin: No, if there's anything I would say, it's just how fascinating it is that Virginia can actually 
create a wine that gives you those parts of the world. And we're kinda equidistant from Napa to 
Bordeaux. We're right in the center, and we're on a similar meridian on the globe. The strata, the 
geology is a lot different. The ribbon of strata that you see on our land actually travels through 
southern Scotland and the end of North Africa near Morocco. It's a pretty unique type of 
geology. 
 
KDS: Like, push all those things go back in time... 
 
Kevin: Like, you can see Africa and all that, you know, it all broke apart. 
 
KDS: One other thing, just about this area, we haven't really talked about the customers and why 
a business like this does well here. What do you find with your... You said you've had people 
walk in who have never had anything more than a margarita, but you also probably have the 
other end of the spectrum as well.

Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017

Kevin: Right, people with big collections, and they're collecting wine from all over the world and 
so on and so forth. What I think... what it really comes down to is Loudoun is one of the 
wealthier counties, if not the wealthiest in the state, like per capita income, and maybe home 
prices and all that kind of stuff, but I think that DC is a cosmopolitan place, and I think that that 
gives you one of, literally, one of the most international... You walk around DC, and you're 
hearing 25 different languages depending on where you are and what's going on. But we're about 
an hour from DC. And for me personally, I feel like that 1-hour drive, it feels a lot shorter 
because once you get outside the perimeter, the Beltway and some of that, you're getting some 
rural stuff. It's all horse farms and sprawling hills. I feel like you psychologically feel like you've 
gotten so much further away from all of that. You know what I'm saying? And also, knowing 
that they are over 50 wineries in Loudoun itself... It allows you to pick a couple of spots and hit a 
couple different wineries on a one day jaunt or something. If it's your birthday and you wanna 
gather a group of 12, and so you get an executive car or limo or something, and you kind of 
advertise that cost, you can hit some spots. You can go to dinner, and it really feels like you got 
out of town. I feel like you really feel like you got out of the metro... I mean, I used to live in 
Arlington, kind of near Old Town Alexandria. And on Thanksgiving and Christmas time, if you 
just get on the road 24/7, it's like an absolute parking lot. It's just like a crazy nightmare. And so I 
think it's a respite to come out to the country to see these beautiful views. And there's aspects of 
this land to me that remind me a little bit of Napa, but a little bit of Tuscany. You see a lot of 
these box canyons in Tuscany, where they're kind of like these rounded like stadium kind of feel, 
and some of these places, the elevation in Napa and stuff like that... I feel like this is sometimes 
has this kind of field and this kind of synergy of Tuscany and Napa in some spots. It's a pretty 
place. 
 
01:37:18 
KDS: Yeah, I think it's one of the most beautiful places in the world. I go other places, and I'm 
like, oh, that's kind of like Virginia. 
 
#fancy bottles of wine #growth in demand 
Kevin: Yeah, I know. And when the leaves are changing, you know, just... I'm saying, when 
October rolls around here and, the leaf papers around it, it's just... That's when we're harvesting, 
blah, blah, blah. So it's just all the fruit is ripening, and it's like, there's just a lot going on, and 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
52
there's just a lot of really unique things about this area. And I don't think... I don't think people 
are thinking about them in that way with the synergy of some of the 2 most famous parts of the 
world for wine in the modern era. Even the European wine world. It's had a Renaissance since 
the early '80s. These Bordeaux wines that are 5, 6, 7, $8000 a bottle. That all really started 
rolling in like the early '80s. They were always famous houses, but they weren't getting as much 
money. They weren't as coveted. 
 
KDS: Maybe also, just the '80s was in the growth of consumers... more people wanting it 
increased the demand and... 
 
#cost #quality #Chinese 
Kevin: Without a doubt. But now most of those wines are being bought by the Chinese. They're 
just buying all the Bordeaux wines and everything. So it's just what economies are booming and 
what drives it... You know, supply and demand, right? And you make amazing Bordeaux blends. 
One of our wines is $65 a bottle, the other one's $69 a bottle before tax and discounts for a 
member, you're still talking low $60s. You compare any $60 bottle from around the globe, you're 
getting a wine of extremely high quality. 
 
KDS: Yeah. 
 
01:39:08 
Kevin: That wine at a restaurant, having gone through distribution is probably $125, $140, $150 
bottle. People are not just gonna give that money to you unless the wine measures up. 
 
KDS: Right. 
 
Kevin: That's not gonna happen. So that in of itself is incredibly validating too, is the amount of 
these wines we sell.

KDS: Yeah. Yeah. You think about it because you can buy it direct... There is no middle man. 
There's no... literally... I think that's part of... You... 
 
Kevin: You can't get more wine for your dollar. 
 
KDS: Yeah. People really enjoy, too, that they know they're not paying a marketing firm and a 
distribution company and a store shelf. 
 
Kevin: How many touches has this had? What about the marketing budget, and the advertising 
budget? 
 
KDS: They're really coming here, and they're meeting people who actually did something with it, 
and they can see where the thing is growing and all of that. 
 
#more to discover #Virginia wine #wine in other states 
 
Kevin: Yeah. So I guess the last thing I would just say is my exposure to the entire Virginia wine 
world in many ways is quite limited. There's so many amazing people doing things that I haven't 
spoken about or spoken to, but I feel very blessed, the very privilege to be part of this project to 
meet the folks that I have met. And there's a lot of people making really wonderful wines in 
Virginia--of different price points of different styles, but I've tasted a lot of really, really 
wonderful wines, and I was very pleasantly surprised by that. And ultimately, it's an exciting 
time to be involved and to see the arc of how it all started. And most states in the nation are 
making wine. And the question, is it about the quality, or is it a traditional style or method? I 
think we're making really world class wines in a great traditional way. And so... 
 
KDS: I think it'll be interesting to see which regions develop to have a real serious commitment 
to making something excellent. I think Virginia is has that. 
 
#Willamette Valley, Oregon #pinot noir #emerging wine areas 
 
Kevin: Well, and I think about the Willamette Valley of Oregon. You know, 30 or 40 years ago, 
there were just fruit trees there and nothing. Not one vineyard at all. Now, it is really arguably 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
54
one of the most famous places for pinot noir in the world, and that's a lot of different producers, 
and they really focused, obviously on the pinot--you know pinot's a grape that needs kind of a 
cool, dry, moderate place to thrive, and it's very temperamental, right? Big grape, thin skin. It's 
got a lot of issues, even in the best, most perfect, optimum place, but that's in a 30-year window. 
This place has become a Mecca for that. 
 
KDS: From around the world. 
 
01:41:54 
#rieseling #ice wines #Finger Lakes of New York #Canada #choices #pricing 
 
Kevin: Yeah, and so it's like you see some dry riesling, off-dry or sweet rieslings, things like that 
from the Finger Lakes of New York; you see ice wines out of Canada, whatever--things I think 
of exceptionally high quality, but I'm just thinking that there's more good wine being made 
everywhere around the world and that's good for the consumer. It allows you to get more choices 
at a better price point, and basically that benefits the consumers and you get better choices at a 
better price, and it's wonderful. 
 
KDS: And everyone can find a place. I mean, maybe you don't like Old World-styled wines or 
whatever, but there is a wine out there that you will probably like. Maybe it's a Tokaj or 
something, but there's something that you can like somewhere. 
 
Kevin: Yeah. For me, that's part of the bias stuff, and that whole umbrella that we talked about is 
so many people have really very strong ideas about wine. And then sometimes you'll just be 
taken a back by... You'll be just surprised by how strong and how opinionated, how powerfully 
people feel that all these things. And so, like I said, if I get a chance, if someone will give me the 
chance to demystify some of this stuff, it's kinda nice to just just break that down because... and I 
try and do in a very subtle way so it's just like, I'm not trying to bludgeon you. 
 
KDS: You're not trying to shame... [Laughs] 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017

Kevin: I'm not gonna shame you into drinking Viognier. Yeah, exactly. I'm just saying my hope 
and my goal is, hopefully I give you enough info that you're like, alright, I'm gonna try and then 
try and be like, no, that isn't my cup of tea. But... 
 
KDS: I see what you mean about... 
 
#youth drinking #alcohol #mixed drinks #jugs of wine 
Kevin: But there are times when you're like, wow, I don't drink red wine, and I like that. And it's 
just like, cause to me, I joke and I tell this story--and I know we should go on, but--anyway, I 
was bartending in Texas when I was a teenager cause the drinking age was 17. And well, at that 
time, we drink bourbon and beer and we drank rum and tequila and things like that. But we didn't 
drink wine. And I had grown up in the Bay Area. So I knew things like Blue Mountain and 
Lancers. And I got big jugs of Julio Gallo Rhine wine and Mateus...

Kevin: Oh, I used to melt candles in there. It was really cool. And I guess the point I'm 
ultimately making is that I ended up working for TGI Fridays basically, and they were pouring 
Sutter Home white zinfandel by the glass. So I would bring that on dates thinking I was all Rico 
Suave, and it tasted like bubblegum. You know what I mean? But it didn't make anybody angry, 
and none of us had ever had wine, and you gotta start somewhere. And so the more wine you get 
a chance to try... And then when you're in environments like restaurants where the menus are 
changing every day, and the wines by the glass are changing, and the lists are changing, and the 
new vintages are coming in, and you get these favorite producers that you really love... You just 
get access. You get access to information, but you also get access to the physical wine. The 
sommeliers, these wine directors, these managers, they will pop bottles and they'll tell you like 
this amazing story. And you're like, "Oh my god, I'm gonna tell that story tomorrow." And now

anniversary, your birthday, or whatever it be, whatever. And it could just be a Tuesday,

Kevin: Yeah. You can tell I'm really shy and demure. 
KDS: That's a problem; you should work on that. 
Kevin: I'm gonna try. I'm gonna do my best. 
 
KDS: Maybe Toastmasters. 
 
Kevin: Maybe I should read Dale Carnegie's How to Win Friends and Influence People. 
 
KDS: Yeah. Alright. Thanks very much. 
Kevin: Thanks for having me. 
KDS: Oh, you're welcome. Thank you for taking the time. I really appreciate it. It's one of those 
things, like sometimes people, like, Bonnie was saying, like, oh that wasn't bad at all. And it's 
like, oh, Bonnie, it's not meant to be bad. 
 
Kevin: It should be fun. 
 
KDS: Yeah, it's supposed to be fun. She was like, "I was like worried about it, and I thought it 
was gonna be scary." 
 
Kevin: Yeah, what's gonna happen? She's attack you. She's not called Stryker for...
