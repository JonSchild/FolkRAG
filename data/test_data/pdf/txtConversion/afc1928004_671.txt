Do To Others as You Wish To Be Done By. 
Sang with tremendous success by NELLIE GEnswx, the celebrated 
Protean Actress. 
0 
There's many's a 
man in this world of ours, 
Whose thoughts are all of self; 
Never thinks of the poor that live next door, 
As he rolls in his horded wealth. 
But there's a 
rule in the Book of Books, 
Says each man has to try 
And that's to do to others 
As you wish to be done by. 
CHORUS: 
Then jogging along through life, my boys, 
Let conscience be your school; 
And lay away for a 
rainy day, 
And observe the golden rule. 
Deserve success by energy, 
It will greet you bye and bye; 
And always do to others 
As you wish to be done by. 
To-day you are rich, when a 
sudden stroke 
May take your gold and lands, 
And then you'll find yourself in need 
Of a 
friend with a 
helping hand. 
Then perhaps you'll meet some one 
You've helped in days gone by, 
Just do to him as he did to you, 
As you wish to be done by.

GOING WEST TO DIE. 
Composed and recited by NELLIE GERMON, America's Classic 
Recitationist. 
Well, here we are, my dear old wife, 
On board the train at last, 
Our little all packed in a 
trunk 
With lock and strap made fast; 
I 
hear the bell a 
ringin', 
And the whistle's piercing cry, 
There, wife, we're moving out of town, 
We're going West to die. 
We've been from Jane's to John's house, 
From John's house back to Jane's, 
'Till now they've laid our burden down 
On board the Western train; 
'Tis rather bard to send us off, 
All crippled up and gray, 
To find a 
place in which to die, 
Two thousand miles away. 
Since we broke up a 
keeping house, 
They've carted us around, 
'Till now it seems on earth for us 
A 
home cannot be found; 
As sure as this old face of mine 
Can ne'er look young again, 
So sure we'll never more return 
To trouble John and Jane. 
They send us to a 
stranger land, 
O'er an untraveled road, 
That Mary, in her Western home 
May bear the heavy load; 
It isn't to be wondered at 
That my eyes are filled with tears, 
Or that my form is bending down 
With more than weight of years. 
I 
didn't think 'twould come to this, 
I 
didn't mean it should; 
No home is like your own home, 
Though made of logs and wood! 
GOING WEST TO DIE..—CoNtus-ut.* 
No bread is sweet when eaten 
Mid bitterness and strife, 
Few care to fill with peace and love 
An old man's closing life. 
Now, o'er a 
long untraveled roan 
We seek a 
stranger hand, 
The old home circle broken up 
At cruel time's command; 
But they cannot our love destrcy, 
'Tis stronger now than when 
Our heads wore not the silver locks 
Of three score years and ten. 
Since we've broke up a 
keeping house 
We've led a 
wretched life, 
Jane put the blame upon her man, 
And John upon his wife; 
They think not of their infancy, 
Of all those tender years 
When night and day we toiled for them 
And wiped their flowing tears. 
We leave behind us all the scenes 
Of early years, dear wife, 
And all the friends with whom we're won 
The victories of life; 
We leave behind the little church 
Where oft we've knelt in prayer, 
But, good wife, we'll never leave 
The God that met us there. 
Although these eyes are growing dim, 
I 
still can see to read 
The precious youth in God's own word, 
That children all should heed; 
Honor thy father, said the Lord, 
Thy mother honor, too; 
Then shall thou live long in the land, 
That God has given you. 
MONEY. 
As sang with immense success by the only Miss NELLIE GERMON. 
What a 
blessing it is to have money, 
Always makes a 
good friend and a 
cronie; 
In a 
palace you'll dwell, there cut a 
great swell, 
That is if you have plenty of money. 
At office, of course, you're perfection, 
Your name bears great weight at election; 
You can have your own way, for you know you can pay 
That is if you have plenty of money. 
What a 
blessing it is to :nave money, 
Your name without Esquire, looks funny; 
The ladies all cry, and after you sigh, 
It's not for yourself, but your money. 
You'll have friends in abundance to greet you, 
It's how do you do when they meet you; 
Just lend me a 
ten, I'll pay you again, 
But that is the last of your money. 
What a 
blessing it is to have money, 
You will not be elected a 
dummy; 
With no fear of the law, you can open your jaw, 
And laugh at the Judge, if you have money, 
If at racing or cards you've been simple, 
Drank wine till your nose is a 
pimple, 
In some Prison or ,Tail, no friends to go bail, 
Then you'll know what it is to have money. 
Never go Back on an Old Friend in Need. 
Written by Wm. DEVERE, expressly tor NELLIE GERSION, and recited 
by her in all the principal theatres. 
0: -
Since apothegms now have become all the fashion, 
There's one I've selected and studied with care; 
It is not philosophic, it doesn't sound dashing, 
But it nurtures the gem of affection so rare. 
Let misanthropes sneer and philosophers argue. 
But keep to the right as you travel life's pathway, 
And never go back on an old friend in need. 
His clothes may be tattered, his hands bard and horny, 
You know that he's honest and true to the core, 
Life's pathway to him may be troubled and thorny, 
While sycophants pass him and know him no more, 
But grasp his rough hand with an honest affection, 
Dispelling, the clouds where his duty may lead 
And wealth couldn't purchase that sweet recollection, 
Alt! never go back on an old friend in need. 
There may come a 
time when adversity's ocean 
Will roll its dark waves o'er your sorrowing head, 
When sunbeams of hope are engulfed in commotion, 
And life's dearest objects seem withered and dead, 
But Bethlehem's star hiall arise in its glory, 
Great hearts and strong hands shall be with you indeed. 
Go read in the Bible that wondrous old story, 
And never go back on an old friend in need. 
All honor to him who in right never falters, 
Who offers his friendship, his heart in his hand, 
I'Vlmse judgment no they soyer ever can alter, 
lie is worthy to be the first judge in the land. 
And when he shall pass from this world to another, 
Write in letters c;f gold that all who run
Rty read: 
" 
Tread softly above the dear bead of a 
brother 
Who never went back on an old friend in need."

The cottage was a 
thatched one, the outside old and mean. 
'Yet everything within that cot was wondrous neat and 
clean; 
The night was dark and stormy, the winds were howling 
wild, 
When a 
patient mother watched beside the death- bed of 
her child. 
A 
little worn-out creature, his once bright eyes grown dim, 
it was a 
Collier's only child, they called him Little Jim, 
And oh! to see the briny tears fast hurrying down her 
cheek, 
As she offered up a 
prayer in thought she was afraid to 
speak; 
Lest she might weaken one she loved far dearer than her 
life, 
For she had all a 
mother's heart had that poor Collier's 
wife. 
With hands uplifted, see she kneels beside the sufferer's 
bed, 
And prays that God will spare the boy, and take herself 
instead; 
OA* 
LITTLE JIM.—CoNTrsulip. 
She gets an answer from the child, soft fall these words 
froni him, 
Mother, the angels do so smile, and beckon Little Jim. 
I 
have no pain, dear mother, now, but oh! I 
am so dry, 
Just moisten poor Jim's lips again, and mother, don't you 
cry; 
With gentle, trembling haste, she held a 
tea-cup to his lips, 
lie smiled to thank her, as he took three little tiny sip s; 
Tell father when he comes from work, I 
bid good-night to 
him, 
And, mother, now I'll go to sleep, alas! poor Little Jim. 
She felt that all was over, that the child she loved so dear, 
I 
lad uttered the last words that she had ever hoped to hear; 
The cottage door was opened, the Collier's step was heard, 
The father and the mother meet, yet never speak a 
word. 
lie takes the candle in his hand, and walks towards the 
bed, 
his quivering lip gives token that the child he loved WaS 
dead; 
With heads bowed down with sorrow, they humbly ask of 
In Heaven, once more to meet again their own Door Little 
Jim.

SMITING THE ROCK. 
Hit of the Pay. 
Original, as Recited by Miss NELLIE GERMON. 
-: 
0 : 
The stern old judge in relentless mood. 
Glanced at the two who before him stood. 
She was bowed and haggard and old, 
He was young, defiant and bold. 
Mother and son, and to gaze at the pair. 
Their different attitudes, look and air, 
One would believe ere the truth were won, 
The mother convicted and not the son. 
There was the mother; the boy stood nigh, 
With a 
shameless look and his head held high. 
Age had come over her sorrow and care, 
There mattered but little so he was there. 
A prop to her years, a 
light to her eyes, 
And prized as only a 
mother can priz' ,; 
But what for him could a 
mother say, 
Waiting his doom on a 
sentence day. 
Her husband had died in his shame and 
And she a 
widow her living to win, 
had toiled and struggled from morn till night, 
Making with want a 
wearisome fight, 
Bent over her work with resolute zeal, 
Till she felt her old frame totter and reel, 
Her weak limbs tremble, her eyes grow dim, 
But she had her boy and she toiled for him. 
And he—he stood in the criminal dock, 
With a 
heart as hard as a 
flinty rock, 
An impudent glance and reckless air, 
Braving the scorn of the gazers there, 
Dipped in crime and encompassed sound. 
With proof of his guilt by his captors found, 
Heady to start, as he phrased it " 
Holding not crime but penitence shame. 
SMITING THE ROCK.—CONTINI1ED. 
Pouring in a 
flood o'er the mother's cheek, 
The moistening prayers where the tongue was 
weak, 
And she saw through the mist of those bitter 
tears, 
Only the child in his innocent years; 
She remembered him pure as a 
child might be, 
The guilt of the present she could not see, 
And for mercy her wistful look made prayer, 
To the stern old judge in his cushioned chair. 
• 
Woman," the old judge crabbedly s 
tid, 
" 
Your boy is the neighborhood's plague and 
dread, 
Of a 
gang of reprobates chosen chief, 
An idler and rioter, ruffian and thief, 
The jury did right for the facts were plain, 
Denial is idle, excuses are vain, 
The sentence the court imposes is one  
" 
Your honor," she cried, " he's my only son." 
The jurors grinned at the words she spoke, 
And a 
ripple of fun through the court room broke, 
But fryer the face of the culprit Caine, 
An angry look and a 
shadow of shame. 
" 
Don't laugh at my mother," loud cried he, 
" 
You've got me fast, and can deal with me; 
But she's too good for your cowardly jeers, 
And I'll"  
then his utterance choked with 
tears. 
The judge for a 
moment bent his head, 
And looked at him keenly, then he said; 
" 
We suspend the sentence, the boy can go," 
And the words were tremulous, forced and low. 
" 
But stay? And he raised his finger, then, 
Don't let them bring you hither again, 
There is something good in you yet, I 
know, 
I'll give you a 
chance, make the most of it, go."

A Contradictio-
n. 
•The mill will never grind again 
With the water that has past?' 
A maxim of the olden time 
That will forever last. 
This theme, in verses written, 
Preaches a 
sermon to all; 
But critically weighed with wisdom, 
How does the lesson fall ? 
The m:I7 upon a 
slope doth stand, 
It bears an antique shape; 
Waters from the mountain-land 
Seem happy to escape, 
And, rushing by the old mill's wheel, 
Causing it to grind, 
Bound madly on the vale beyond, 
A 
level there to find. 
The race now o'er, with calmness 
Into a 
lake the water flows, 
And, mingling with the tranquil flood, 
Seeks peace in sweet repose. 
The bright sunbeams then visiting 
This realm to Somnus given. 
The tiny globes in vapors rise 
To space above in heaven. 
Once in air, they congregate, 
Fantastic clouds to be, 
And, wafted by the summer breeze, 
Float off most gracefully. 
Soon the mountain tops are reached, 
Ere they cling for rest ; 
Each rugged peak is 1.(1 from view, 
Each in vapor dressed. 
At morn the clouds would fain ascend, 
And leave this dreary plain; 
But, chilled through by the frigid air, 
Condensed, they fall in rain. 
As the pearly drops alight, 
They dance about with glee, 
For are they not of earth again, 
Just as they used to be ? 
They prance, they skip, and race along, 
O'er pebbled brook and rill— 
When lo! they reach familiar ground. 
And pass the same old mill. 
In doing so they turn the wheel, 
With sparkling spray o'ercast, 
Thus proving that the mill does grind 
With water that has past. 
Philosophically the lesson's taught, 
Bidding us beware, 
Although a 
chance unheeded pass, 
Not to incite despair. 
Labor on with redoubled zeal, 
Lost hours to redeem, 
And teach your conscience thus to feel, 
That things are what they seem. 
Opportunities appearing lost, 
And numbered with the slain. 
By providential agencies 
Will surely come again. 
Now bear in mind, although the Fates 
Your hopes continually blast, 
Kind Nature's mill will grind agates 
With watet that has vst.

HOCH O'LEARY. 
A recitation delivered all over 
the United States by Wm. 
ScANLAN, in W M. SCANLAN'S original sketch, entitled 
PREPARING FOR THF STAGE. 
As performed by SCANLAN & CRONIN, the celebrated Versatilw 
Sketch Artists, Vocalists and Dancers. 
One summer day, long, long ago, 
When I 
was a 
li;tle fellow, 
A 
piper wandered to our door, 
Grey-headed, blind and yellow. 
And aui how glad was my young heart, 
Though the sky and earth looked dreary, 
When I 
saw the stranger and his dog, 
Poor Pinch and Keoch O'Leary. 
And when he stowed away his bags, 
Crossed barred, green and yellow, 
I 
thought and said in all Ireland's ground, 
There's not so fine a 
fellow— 
And Fenian Burke and Shaun McGee, 
And Eily, Kate and Mary, 
Rushed in with panting heart to see, 
And Welcome Keoch O'Leary. 
Well, Keoch and Pinch slept well that night; 
And in the morning early 
lie woke me up to hear him play, 
The wind that break the barley. 
Then he stroked my flaxen hair, - 
And murmured Mack you deary, 
And how I 
wept when he said farewell, 
And think of Keoch O'Leary. 
Well, twenty summers have gone past, 
And June's red sun was sinking, 
When, a 
man, stood by my door, 
Of twenty sad things thinking. 
A. little dog came up the lane, 
His steps was slow and weary, 
4,.nd at his tail a 
lame man limped: 
'Twas Pinch and Keoch O'Leary. 
Ah, Keoch I But ahi how wobegone — 
His form is bowed and bending. 
His fleshless hands are thin and wan, 
And time is ever blending 
The color of his thread bare bags; 
And Pinch is twice as hairy, 
And thin- spare as when last I 
saw, 
Himself and Keoch O'Leary. 
(The old Man entelS). 
God's blessing here I 
the wanderer cried. 
Far, far! befell black viper; 
Does anybody here about, 
Remember Keoch, the Piper? 
Ves, yes! I 
said ; the old tuan wept 
As if his heart was breaking. 
And where avic machree, he cried, 
is all the merry making 
I 
left here twenty years ago ? 
tale I 
sighted might weary; 
Enough to say, there's Done hut mc, 
To welcome Keoch O'Leary. 
Woe! woe! the wanderer cried, 
And wrung his hands in sorrow. 
Pray lead me in, asthore 
And I'll go home to- morrow; 
My peace is made I'll calmly leave. 
This world so lone and dreary, 
And you can have my pipes and dog, 
And pray for Keoch O'Leary. 
With Pinch I 
watched his bed that night, 
Next day his prayer was granted. 
He died, and Father James was called, 
And the requiem mass was chanted. 
The neighbors came, we dug his grave 
Near Eily, Kate and Mary. 
And there he sleeps his last sweet sleep. 
God rest you, Keoch O'Leary,

A 
burlesque recitation delivered by the great artiste comique, Miss 
MATTIE VICKERS. 
 ::— 
Vere is de Deutcher's Vaterland? 
Is it Hoboken, Weehawken, or de land 
Where beer does tlow, 
Where bretzels grow, 
Is dot de Deutcher's Vaterland? 
Where is de Deutcher's Mutterland? 
Is it limburger, smeerkase, or de land 
Where bull pups do play 
Peenaehel for beer all (lay, 
Is dat de Deuteher's Vaterland? 
Where is de Deutcher's Grantvaterland? 
Where de stale limburger can walk,

Yes, dot's de German's mutter- in-law land. 
Looking for Dates. 
Written by CHARLES JEROME for his friend EMILE AMES. 
Good morning, Mr. Agent, 
Anything new to-day ? 
Heard from his Nibs in Boston, 
What did he have to say ? 
What! says he never heard of us ? 
-Well, he must have a 
cheek; 
We've been together for the last ten ) ears, 
And ru-ver lost a 
week. 
Cull we have the finest wardrobe, 
And all our acts are new. 
My partner he can do the flip, 
And I 
can do one, too; 
Our breakneck biz it is immense, 
We're sure to kill them dead; 
My pard he turns a 
double, 
And stands right on his head. 
We also do a 
double clog, 
Or on the end can sit; 
I 
know all the funny gags, 
And my partner does the split. 
We also do an Irish act, 
And I 
can walk a 
rope, 
Do straight biz for a 
stump speech, 
And we furnish our own soap. 
I 
can sing a 
ballad, dance a 
fling, 
Or do the man fish act; 
I 
work in dramas, I'm a 
funny clown, 
I 
can split them up the back. 
So that must be a 
mistake, 
Or the salary is too high; 
You can't be up with cullies 
Who think they are too fly. 
So just drop him another line 
And tell him what we do, 
And if you can't catch a 
hundred ; 
Take twenty for the two.

A 
GOOD FELLOW, 
A 
humorous Recitation by En 11A IIRIGAS. 
CHEESE pards, I'll give it out straight, 
How I

bum, 
Don't lay it altogether, rocks, 
On whisky, gin and rum. 
Put some of it to good nature, 
I

I

They said I

good feller 
Have a 
ball, no mixey pards, 
I 
his't no more this year, 
Go in and get your load, 
But don't say I 
gave you a 
steer. 
I'm agin 'em shure, bet on me, 
On the avenue or in a 
cellar, 
I've drank enough to swim a 
ship, 
That's when I 
was a 
good fellow. 
You're young, fresh, full of chin, 
You've got to keep up your lick, 
There's a 
way to get out of it soon, 
There amt much need of a 
kick 
Stay home and study figures, 
It's an old thing for me to bellow, 
Studying Hoyle was solid for me, 
That's wnen t 
was a 
good fellow.

Arother's sick, ah, that's tough. 
You say you're her only kid, 
Don't use the old woman rough, 
Might get a 
stepmother instead. 
If you aunt flowing I'm lying. 
You start like a 
steam propeller, 
Boy, you'll do a 
heap of that crying, 
If you stick to being a

When a

VIcGINNISS. 
iWritten by HARRY BENNETT, and delivered with great succeso 
at Yolks Theatre, Brooklyn. 
A YOUNG man to this city came, 
In walking he was slightly game, 
Patricius was his maiden name— 
MeGinnios. 
The boys they used to call him gimps, 
As on the street he'd slowly limp, 
,They sold him Croton bugs for shrimp--
McGinniss. 
Taking a 
kind friend's gooa advice, 
He went and got a 
job so nice, 
In the undertaker's, cracking ice— 
McGinnis. 
At first the times were rather rough, 
But now he's doing well enough, 
For he can stand them—he is tough— 
MeGinniss. 
Long live that good young man, say I, 
And when time comes for him to die, 
Free lunches one and all will cry—

On the Road. 
Written by CHARLES F. JERoNtE. 
I 
tell you it's no use talking, boys, I'm going to stop right here 
I've had no money for the last three weeks, and the " man 
ager" I 
think is queer ; 
Now, what's the old guy giving us, when he says he's got no 
money ? 
I'm sure the house was good last night, so he needn't get so 
funny. 
Why, the hotel man is kicking, and the board bill's up to-day, 
So if it's not settled by this evening, we'll have to skip away; 
And the Chinese laundry's got my washing—I've only got one 
collar— 
And he says that he won't give them up, for I owe him jubt 
one dollar. 
So let us go and strike his nibs, and see what we can do, 
Tell him we must have some wealth, and we may catch & 
case or two. 
And if he doesn't give it up, we'll not go on to-night, 
For he cannot do without us, boys, so we have him dead to 
rights; 
Just tell the song and dance men what we are going to do, 
And tell them not to wash up until they get their money, too 
And tell that " serio-comic queen " she'd better write for dates, 
Or we'll put her up for a 
walking match against her rival--• 
" 
Kitty Bates." 
Also that snide Dutch actor, he need not be afraid, 
If he gets left upon the road, he can go and learn a 
trade. 
So the best thing, boys, that we can do, is to try and stop 
" 
beat,"• 
For he may thinlc, as others do, that actors never eat ; 
And I 
know- that I 
eat reular—that is, when I'm at home, 
And when I 
strike that good old spot, I 
never more will roam.

Baby Now is Sleeping 'Neath Where the 
Roses Lie. 
Composed by DENNIS MORETON, and recited with terrific applause 
and unlimited success by the premier mimic of the 
vaudeville stage, CHARLES S. 
RooEus. 
To our home like slimmer sunshine baby came a 
year to-
day, 
Roguish smiles and pretty dimples round his pretty faco 
did play; 
He filled our hearts with gladness, he bound us with ‘t 
band of gold, 
And we dreamt bright, airy day dreams of happiness un-
told. 
How we loved our pretty darling we, who lost him, only 
know, 
For he now is calmly resting where the Summer roses grow. 
When first he came amongst us on his cheeks the roses 
bloomed, 
But a 
long and dreary sickness our helpless darling doomed. 
Day by day he wasted slowly as we watched by his crib's 
Side, 
We saw that he was drifting with the awful tide. 
One day o'er death's dark river his wasted form did go, 
Baby now is calmly sleeping where the Summer roses grow. 
What a 
void he left behind, he who to us was so dear, 
And e'en the glorious Spring-time to our withered loves 
looks drear ; 
But sometimes in fitful slumber his vanished form I 
see, 
And his smile of baby gladness in happy dreams I 
see. 
But alas!‘ 
then, when I 
waken, I 
feel my bitter woe, 
For mv baby boy is sleeping neath where the roses grow.

"Father, who travels the road so late?" 
"Hush, my child; ' tis the candidate." 
Fit example of human woes— 
Early he comes and late he goes; 
He greets the women with courtly grace, 
He kisses the baby's dirty face, 
He calls to the fence the farmer at work, 
He bores the merchant, he bores the ckrk. 
The blacksmith, while his anvil rings, 
lie greets, and this is the song he sings 
" 
Howdy, howdy, howdy do? 
How is your wife, and how are you? 
Ali it tits my fist as no other can, 
The horny hand of the workingman." 
" 
Husband, who is that man at the gate?" 
"Hush, my love; ' tis the candidate." 
"Husband, why can't he work like you! 
Has he nothing at home to do?" 
My dear, whenever a 
man is down, 
No cash at home, no money in town, 
Too stupid to preach, too proud to beg, 
Too timid to rob, and too lazy to dig, 
Then over his horse his leg, he

"Howdy, howdy, howdy do? 
How is your wife, and how are you? 
Alit it fits my fist as no other can,

Brothers, who labor early and late, 
Ask these things of the candidate: 
What's his record? How does he stand 
At home? No matter about his hand, 
Be it hard or soft, so it be not prone 
To close over money not his own. 
Has he in view no thieving plan? 
Is he honest and capable?—he is our man. 
Cheer such a 
one till the welkin rings, 
Join in the chorus when thus he sings: 
"Howdy, howdy, howdy do? 
How is your wife, and how are you? 
Ahil it fits my fist as no other can, 
The horny hand of the workingman."

THE IRISH MAN AND THE JEW. 
By JERRY COHAN. 
Recited at HARRY MINER'S Opening by 
lUReuy. 
I 
once of an Irish-man heard a 
story, 
He was climbing a 
ladder in all his glory; 
Just as Paddy had got to the top, 
A German Jew Peddler near the ladder did stop. 
When some bricks dropped out of the Irish-ma:Ls i:od, 
And struck Mr. Jew right square on the nou; 
The Hebrew had on a 
new silk hat, 
And of course, he was mad as the Devil at Pat. 
He looked up at the Irish-man, and said 
What for you come so near break mine head? 
My hat is all smashed, vot I 
done mahout it? 
Dis country mit Irish-man ish crowded. 
Pat looks down from his perch, and said, 
I 
wish to the Lord I 
had broke your head; 
Or smashed the big nose on your face, 
You son of a 
lying, thieving race! 
You great big murthering thief of a 
Jew, 
But for your forefathers, the like of you, 
The Blessed Lord, so they tell 
Would be alive this day, and doing well! 
GUESS! 
If a 
sore-eyed Bull- frog should play the fiddle for green 
horn Canary Bird to dance a 
jig with the Bald Headed 
Eagle, how many lop- sided egg shells would it take to 
masticate a 
chew of tobacco?

HEATHEN CHINAMAN. 
RECITATION. 
As given by the HAvnEs in their great sketch. 
We'll tell about a 
Chinaman, 
He was born in the town of Cahoes; 
His head it was flat, just like a 
bed-slat, 
lie used to wear 1
-u 
n- skin shoes. 
He had freckles all over his face, 
And warts all over his tongue, 
his nose it was hooked, his legs they were crooked, 
He looked like a 
tramp or a 
burn, 
This heathen Chinaman. 
He got the croup while eating soup, 
We thought he was a 
goner; 
lie got sore eyes looking at pies 
In a 
grocery around the corner. 
He had a 
face like a 
Texas steer, 
And eyes like a 
soft shell crab; 
He had the glanders and yellow jandeis, 
We thought he would go mad, 
This heathen Chinaman. 
Ills head it was big as a 
drum, 
lie was tongue-tied in the feet; 
lie fell through a 
hall and lit on his gall, 
And landed away out in the street. 
lie had a 
big wart on his ear, 
A 
cancer on his back; 
While shoveling fog he was bit by a 
hog, 
We packed him home in a 
sack, 
This heathen Chinaman. 
His mouth was twisted from eating hot biscuit, 
He was anything but stout; 
You could hear him holler fourteen milcs, 
And he never had the gout. 
When he walked the street his back would squeak, 
He always had the blues; 
lie was long and thin like a 
piece of tin, 
lie was horn in the town of Cahoes, 
This heathen Chinaman,

MORNING ON THE IRISH COAST, 
By JOHN LOCKE, 
Recited by Mr. J. F. SULLIVAN, of CRONIN & SULLIVAN, at HARRY' 
MINE'S THEATRE, N. Y., and throughout the country, 
Tit' anam au Dhia! but there it is, 
The dawn on the hills of Ireland! 
God's angels lifting the night's black veil 
From the fair, sweet face of my sireland! 
Oh, Ireland, isn't it grand you look, 
Like a 
bride in her rich adornin', 
And with all the pent up love of my heart, 
I 
bid you the top o' the mornin'. 
This one short hour pays lavishly back 
For many a 
year of mourning; 
I'd almost venture another flight, 
There's so much joy in returning_ 
Watching out for the hallowed shore, 
All other attractions scornire; 
Oh, Ireland, don't you hear me shout? 
I 
bid you the top o' the mornin'. 
Ho— ho! upon Cleena's shelving strand, 
The surges are grandly beating, 
And Kerry is pushing her headlands out 
To give us the kindly greeting; 
Into the shore the sea-birds fly 
On pinions that know no drooping; 
And out from the cliffs, with welcomes charged, 
A 
million of waves come trooping. 
Oh, kindly, generous Irish land, 
So leal and fair and loving, 
No wonder the wandering Celt should think 
And dream of you in his roving! 
The alien home may have gems and gold— 
Shadows may never have gloorned it; 
But the heart will sigh for the absent land, 
Where the love-light first illumed it. 
29 
MORNING ON THE IRISH COAST—CONTINUED. 
And doesn't old Cove look charming there, 
Watching the wild waves' motion, 
Leaning her back up against the hills, 
And the tip of her toes on the ocean? 
I 
wonder I 
don't hear Shandon's bells, 
Ah, may be their chiming's over, 
For it's many a 
year since I 
began 
The life of a 
Western rover. 
For thirty summers, astore machree, 
Those hills I 
now feast my eyes on, 
Ne'er met my vision, save when they rose 
Over Memory's dim horizon. 
E'en so, 'twas grand and fair they seemed 
In the landscape spread before me; 
But dreams are dreams, and my eyes would ope 
To see Texas' sky still o'er me. 
Ah! oft upon the Texan plains, 
When the day and the chase were over, 
My thoughts would fly o'er the weary wave, 
And around this coast-line hover; 
And the prayer would rise, that some future day 
All danger and doubtings scornin', 
I'd help to win my native land 
The light of young liberty's mornin'. 
Now fuller and truer the shore-line shows-
Was ever a 
scene so splendid! 
I 
feel the breath of the Munster breeze. 
Thank God that my exile's ended. 
Old scenes, old songs, old friends again, 
The vale and cot I 
was born in! 
Oh, Ireland, up from my heart of hearts, 
I 
bid you the top of the mornin',

BUTTERCUPS AND DAISIES. 
Written by Boum' NEWCOMB expressly for W ILL H . 
M ORTON, America's 
Cornique. 
When a 
little boy I 
wandered, ' twas a 
pleasant summer's 
day, 
My heart was like a 
feather as I 
journeyed on my way, 
To my eager footsteps soil t_ 
green grass laid, 
With a 
little playmate, such a 
tin 7 
maid, 
Playing I 
war poor man, playing she -wa, rich, 
flow her merry laughter reached the highest pitch, 
Pointing to the daisies silver wealth untold, 
Buttercups unnumbered, these she said were gold. 
With the time departing soon the air was chilled, 
Out upon the crisp wind loud the robin thrilled, 
Once again I 
wandered with my little maid, 
To our treasure garden vast in wealth arrayed, 
Soon we knew a 
robber, Jack Frost was his name, 
had been there before us and taken all our gain 
With his icy fingers and a 
grasp so cold 
Stole our silver daises and buttercups of gold. 
Man's estate I 
reached then, but I 
ne'er forgot 
My little maid companion and our treasure spot, 
For there was a 
lesson in our strange belief, 
Summer was our banker, Winter was our thief, 
So it is with friends, then sometimes so will' all, 
They're true to us in sunshine but leave us in the fall, 
'When a 
warm friend slights me or he treats me cold, 
I 
think of silver daisies and buttercups of gold.

O'Reilley's Billy Goat. 
A RECITATION. 
Written by SHEEHAN and McGroNE. 
Respectfully dedicated 
to Jonx REILLY. 
O'Reilley owned a 
billy goat 
And a 
great buck goat was he, 
He would buck almost any thing 
That he'd happen for to see. 
And if at night he'd roam the streets 
And a 
drunken man he'd meet, 
He'd buck him till he was sick and tired, 
And then his clothes he'd eat— 
O'Reilley's billy goat. 
He knew every policeman on the beat, 
And he knew if him they found 
That he'd spend a 
short vacation 
Down here in the c:ty pound. 
He ate Mrs. Mulligan'o underclothes 
That was hanging on the line, 
Shure he bucked a 
Dutchman in the belly, 
And knocked him out of time— 
O'Reilley's billy goat. 
But every goat must have his day, 
And this goat's day did come— 
He met a 
butcher's dog one day, 
And the dog for him did run. 
He chased the goat through the streets, 
Shure the dog for him was too smart, 
lie chased him till he lost his wind 
And he died of a 
broken heart— 
O'Reilley's billy goat. 
Now, down here in a 
vacant lot 
In a 
corner quite alone, 
There we lluried O'Reilley's goat, 
And over' him raised a 
stone ; 
And perchance you'd pass that way, 
You'll find those words on it are wrote: 
Sacred to the memory of 
O'Reilley's great buck goat.

Out of Employment. 
RECITATION. 
Written by D AN SULLY for Miss DAISY RENIINGTON, and recited by he 
with great success in the principal theatres. 
Out of employment, starvation in view, 
Now what has a 
poor man in my place to do? 
Weary I 
wander, careworn and sad, 
I'm looking for work, and there's none to be had. 
Choosing rather to die than to beg or to steal, 
The sharp pangs of hunger I 
try to conceal ; 
Weary I 
wander, sadly I 
roam, 
To earn food for the little ones starving at home. 
Vain, vain are those tears, but still they will flow, 
To yield to despair is womanly, I 
know ; 
I 
must choke down the lump which will rise in my throat, 
And strive to live on, though I 
have not a 
groat. 
Yes, I'll strive to live on, though again and again 
Does the mad thought of suicide flash through my brain; 
Dinnerless, supperless, still I 
must roam, 
To eam food for the little ones starving at home. 
Now, why should a 
man, be he Christian or Turk, 
Be doomed to such hardships while he's willing to work ? 
For months I've been wandering half crazed through 
your town, 
Tin my strength is nigh gone and I'm quite broken down. 
Oh, God : it were better, perhaps, to be dead, 
For they won't give me work, and I 
can *t beg my bread; 
No money, no work, sadly I 
roam, 
There's no help for the little ones starving at nome. 
O'REILLY vs. McDERMOTT. 
Written by PATRICK NEESON for Sax RICKEY, and originally recited 
by EDWARD HALEy, of " The 2 
HALEYS. 
Not one hundred yards from where I 
stand, 
In this, our glorious Union land, 
Was kept a 
first-class whisky stand 
By a 
man, and his name was O'Connor. 
A matt that's known both near and far, 
Attends to Mike O'Connor's bar, 
He, in our late war, received no scar, 
And his name is O'Reilly. 
Beneath our starry banners wave, 
There was not a 
man fought half so brave, 
Or more greenbacks for whisky gave, 
Than McDermott. 
O'Connor's gin-mill blazed with light, 
On that eventful and bloody night, 
When McDermott had the fearful fight 
With O'Reilly. 
With frowning brow and flashing eye, 
O'Reilly drank a 
glass of rye, 
Which he demolished without a 
sigh; 
Then turning to McDermott, he said, 
You alcoholic vat! 
you drunken loon! 
You've no more brains than a 
wee gossoon; 
Begorra, I'll make you change your tune, 
Says McDermott. 
With sleeves rolled up, O'Reilly stood 
And swore he'd die, before he would 
Take back a 
single word that could 
In any manner be construed 
Into an apology to McDermott. 
McDermott went for O'Reilly's nose, 
And on it planted fearful blows, 
Till on his eye a 
shanty arose, 
Erected by McDermott. 
O'Reilly fell into a 
swoon, 
And his head rested on a 
big spittoon; 
Then he dreamt of Barnum's big Balloon, 
While McDermott quietly put on his 
Coat, and went home about his business.

"DAN DORKINS." 
[Burlesque Poem.] 
As: delivered by PAT ROONEY, the peoples favorite, with rounds of 
applause. 
The theatre was full, and so was the actors, 
Dan Dorkins was going to appear 
That night in a 
bare-tooted slack wire clog, 
For he was the pompey round here. 
The bar-room was perfectly crowded with beats, 
Who waited a 
pleasant surprise; [out, 
For they knew they would eat when the lunch was so4 
And they longed for the curtain to rise. 
The curtain arose and so did the people, 
Who commenced for to shout and hurrah; 
Dan Dorkins came out with young Oliver Twist, 
And they gave him the laugh and " Yah, yahl" 
The play it began when the curtain went up, 
But something was wrong I 
felt sure; 
"lies away off his base," says old Joe Jewell, 
Who never went back on the poor. 
A. brick I 
yes, it, was! I 
saw Dorkins start, 
And carom on the dark-red for two; 
And it made me feel thirsty to see how he worked, 
And continually dropping his cue. 
He says: " I'm a 
king!" when a 
woman jumped up 
And says: " You lie, you are one of the ga!igI" 
It knocked Dorkins cold, he owed her for washing, 
And his head on his breast he did hang. 
At length to the footlights he approached with a 
rush, 
A 
ad " Ladies and gentlemen," said, 
" 
If I 
have not drank enough Bourbon to-night, 
The fault is my wealth, not my head. 
Many a 
time I 
have made you all sick, 
A 
ad get up and go out for a 
beer; 
When o'Leary and I 
walked a 
mile in a 
week, 
flow I 
NViS11 0111d 'Sam Sandford' was here. 
Yon 
me to-night, and say I 
am sober, 
Let Tony Pastor play hamlet alone; 
tel you the reason, I 
know you won't laugh, 
a 
mot her-iu-law dead drunk at home."

Copyright, 1878, by HAREdsoN MILLARD. 
Sung with tremendous success by W. FRED AYmArt, America's 
Greatest Grotesque Clown. 
There it stands in the corner with its back to the wall, 
The old wooden rocker so stately and tall; 
With naught to disturb it but the duster or broom. 
For no one now uses that back parlor room; 
Oh, how well I 
remember in days long gone by, 
When we stood by that rocker, my sister and I; 
And we listened to the stories that our grandma would ten 
By that old wooden rocker we all loved so well. 
CHORUS: 
As ..e 
sat by the fire she would rock, rock, rock, 
t 
we heard but the tick of the old brass clock; 
Eighty years she had sat in that chair grim and tall, 
In that old wooden rocker that stood by the wall. 
If this chair could but speak, oh, the tales it could tell, 
How poor aged grandpa in fierce battle fell; 
'Neath the stirs and the stripes he fought bravely and true 
Ile cherished his freedom, the red, white and blue; 
It could tell of bright days and of dark ones, beside, 
Of the day when dear grandma stood forth as a 
bride; 
This is why we all love it, this old chair grim and tall, 
The old wooden rocker that stands by the wall. 
(Chorus). 
But poor grandma is gone, and her stories are done, 
tier children have followed her, yes, one by one; 
They have all gone to meet her " in the sweet by- and- bye," 
And all that is left is dear sister and I; 
Never more will we hide her gold specks or her cap, 
Never more will we tease her while taking her nap; 
Never more will she slumber in that chair grim and tall, 
The old wooden rocker that stood by the wall.

France has got the Fleur-de-lis, 
And England's got the Rose; 
And Scotland for her Ensign, 
The Ifeather Thistle shows. 
But Ireland's got the Shamrock, 
In all her valley's seen; 
And ever wears upon her breast, 
The triple leaf of green. 
Clionus: 
Then Irishmen remember, 
Wherever you may roam; 
The Isle that's crowned with Shamrock, 
Is still your native home. ( Repeat). 
On many a 
foreign battle-field, 
It cheered the Irish boy; 
And won the brighest laurels, 
At glorious Fontenoy. 
Go where you will, from pole to pole, 
Where'er the Celt may be; 
You'll find he loves that dear old Isle, 
That sparkles in the sea.

She's up at Macy's—you all know Macy's— 
Fourteenth Street, Sixth Avenue. 
She handles lace with such a

She is so charming, ' tis quite alarming, 
The way the fellows at her stare.

She loves me fondly with a 
heart so true; 
I 
take her to the car, I'm solid with her ma, 
She's up at Macy's Fourteenth Street, Sixth Avenue. 
She's so congenial, there's nothing menial, 
She finds a 
kindred spirit here; 
I 
find the yardstick a 
very hard stick— 
Instead of wine I 
must drink beer. 
I'm on Broadway for little pay, 
And on the ladies wait all day; 
With joy I'm greeted, when I 
am seated, 
My heart to Flora flies away.

Whenever we go out to dine; 
But I

To me she seems a

myself, but not at Macy's; they're all girls up there— they 
wouldn't have such a 
thing as a 
man around. 
Flora is 
such a 
sweet girl. 
She used to go round a 
great deal, but 
now we are more settled down; there was a 
time I 
used to 
think nothing of going out and spending two dollars all by 
myself in one night, just for beer. 
We used to go to Coney 
Island very often. 
I 
remember one day Flora got so sick 
on the boat I 
didn't know what to do. ' Oh,' she cried, 
" 
I 
want a 
scuze of a 
lemon, just one scuze." 
But lemons 
were ten cents apiece. 
She recovered, however, and the 
next day you could hear her sweet voice up at Macy's call 
lug, " Cash here! 
Cash here! 
Cash! 
Cash!" 
CHORUS: 
She wears a 
circular, all made of silk and fur, 
And on her hat a 
bunch of violets blue; 
She smokes a 
cigarette, she sings me " Olivette," 
She's up at Macy's, Fourteenth Street, Sixth Avenue.

Oh, the darkies moonlight picnic, 
Takes place but once a 
year, 
And all the high-toned colored folks, 
They come from far and near. 
We have a 
large Pavilion built, 
Way out upon the green, 
And hosts of handsome yellow gals, 
Can always there be seen. 
Cuouus. 
The music sweetly plays, 
As around the room we glide, 
One gent and well dressed lady, 
Always dancing side by side. 
We have three dandy waiters, 
Alexander, Pete and Dick, 
They'll serve you with refreshments, 
At the darkies' moonlight picnic.

And luxuries both rich and rare, 
The finest in the land.

Don't we have a 
high old tune, 
And at the moonlight picnic, don't 
We darkies cut a 
shine. 
CHORUS. 
All join hands, then cross over, 
Then back to your places glide, 
Sash-shay up and down the middle, 
With your darling by your side. 
Then you treat her to refreshments, 
Make the other coons look sick, 
Oh, what fun we'll always have, 
At the darkies' moonlight picnic.

Soothe Me, Honey. 
Sung with immense success by W ILLIAMS and SULLY, at H ARRIGAN and 
H ART'S Theatre Connive, New York 
Copyrihted by A. J. FNH ER, 1879. 
In de street we did meet 
Old Miss Phebe Snow, 
Told us ' bout a 
dance dis evening, 
We am gwine to go. 
Sue and Sal, Zeke and Hal, 
Said dey'd take de cake ; 
When dey see us coming yonder, 
Make dere bosoms ache. 
C

Vs, 
Soothe my feelings, honey. 
Sing dat good old song; 
Take me out among de roses, 
Whar you been so long. 
Rock and roll de cradle, 
Give my heart to you; 
Don't you grieve, and never leave me 
Soothe me honey, do. 
Parson Leek fetch his feet, 
Wear dem in a 
shoe; 
Take de hinges off de gate, 
So he can get through.

Soothe my feelings, honey, & c. 
Always Speak a 
Kind Word when you Can. 
Sung by F.nwiN BARRY, at Harrigan & Hart's Theatre Coraiqu, amid 
roars of applause. 
Strange sayings are the rage, on the stre6: and on the stage, 
And many glorious maxims you will find; 
lint there's one more than the rest 
Seems to linger in my oreast, And very oft comes stealing 
(Army mind ; 
I'll sing a 
song to-night of a 
motto true and bright, 
A 
lesson it conveys sublime and grand, 
To the beggar at your door, or to anyone that's poor, 
Always speak a 
good and kind word when you can. 
Now there's many a 
man, who great riches does command, 
But his praises and his honors they are small ; 
But when he's dead and gone, they will speak of him and 
mourn, 
And say how good that he has been to all. 
And while upon this earth, struggling hard through life, 
No one would assist him in his plans ; 
But the stories they relate when they know it is too late, 
For they never speak a 
kind word when they can. 
The workingman to-day with his poor and scanty pay, 
• 
Striving very hard his family to maintain ; 
While the rich they stay at home with the riches that they own, 
The poor may ask assistance all in vain. 
When humble is your lot in the wretched laborer's cot, 
Don't pass them by, but take them by the hand, 
Don't turn your head away, but remember what I 
say, 
Always speak a 
good and kind word when you can.

PADDY CLIFFORD'S GOAT. 
Parody ii" Paddy Duffey's Cart," Written and Composed by EDWIN 
TALBOT. 
Dedleated to WILLLIAm GEOGHEGAN, Esq., col.. 
Grand and Cannon Sts., New York. 
On many Summer's evenings, to pass the time away, 
Outside of Paddy Clifford's door, so merry and so gay, 
He kept down near the hook Dock, on the street de 
Madison, 
The crowd would meet and there would treat, and then 
begin the fun. 
There was Mickey Brady, a 
boy from Donnegal, 
La Fayette and Crookey, who never worked at all, 
Big Bab Quinn, the copper, and a 
tough they all called 
bloat, 
Trowing bricks and playing tricks on Paddy Clifford's 
goat. 
The Dew Drop inn was 'lobby, the boys they knew it well 
Shellou he had a 
big brown dog, and how that dog could 
yell; 
ttI te'd bark at Paddy Clifford and one day tore his coat, 
And his wife. Judy, chased poor old- Jeff for biting her 
old goat. 
Little -
1N.Teddy Clifford, Paddy's only son, 
He was a 
friend of Miley Myers, and rated number one, 
Chink Chatham was a 
boxer and won many a 
prize, 
Fought the goat that tore his coat and swallowed Fox's 
pies.

PADDY CLIPFORD'S GOAT.—CONTINUED. 
This gang they were all dandies and some State's prison 
got, 
And some are still alive and well and a 
doing I 
know not 
what. 
There was Big Jack Ryan, the Blower and Big Toni 
Owens, the Horse, 
A plagueing Paddyy. Clifford's goat because they was the 
boss; 
There was Great Big Clover and Stumpy Butsy Coyle, 
flanging up the Dutchman, drinking all his oil. 
Never dreamed of working, Pat Toole his name he wrote, 
And said he'd take the photograph of Paddy Clifford's 
goat. 
Oh, I 
hope you'll all remember those happy times we had, 
And how the boys would fly around when Hussey would 
fret mad; 
He'd scare a squad of fine police and of whiskey drink 
galore, 
lie left New York and all his work to see his emerald 
shore. 
There was Paddy McGee, the tailor, a 
man out of his 
mind, 
Sally Sinders you all know, a 
brave man of his kind, 
And a 
man they called Olvany who used to play by note, 
For a 
gang they called the Etna Club and Paddy Clifford' 
goat.

Only the Way on the Stage. 
Composed by FRED. J. MACKI.EY and sung by HENRY GRAHAMr 
If you will listen to me, sonic facts I 
will mention, 
Concerning the past and the present strange age, 
Ind in them, my friends, to you I'll relate 
Some things I 
saw one night and played on the stage : 
I 
came to this city with one or two friends, 
And went for a 
stroll, they seemed quite amazed, 
\ 
Then we read on the bills of the Bowery Theatre, 
And found a 
new drama was played on the stage. 
1 
he first scene I 
saw was a 
street in New York, 
There a 
poor woman begging, she quite old in age, 
1 
hose sad means she tried to keep her from starving, 
A 
very sad lesson of life's book a 
page; 
But a 
policeman passed by, his face seemed all smiles, 
Placed his hand in his pocket and drew forth his wages, 
And he gave part to help this poor wretched woman, 
But ' twas only the way it was played on the stage. 
The scene it then changed from a 
street to a 
court room, 
There a 
prisoner on trial for a 
crime very sad, 
it e'd murdered a 
man, by the people respected, 
Anci the court room was crowded with people so glad 
To see that man punished for the crime he committed. 
The jury looked stern, and the judge in a 
rage, 
And they hung that.rich man for the murder of Fisk, 
But it was only the way it was played on the stage. 
In the next scene I 
saw a 
clergyman _ rom Brooklyn, 
Who was dancing a 
hornpipe, and seemed quite the rage, 
Another one from Jersey was playing the violin, 
The audience in front with wonderment gazed; 
For just at that minute a 
party named Tilton 
Then gave a 
fine sermon on the morals of the age, 
And I 
thought that they practiced each sermon they preached, 
But it was only the way it wrs plgye.1 on the stage.

Oh, the moon is out to-night, 
Sweet Irene; 
And my heart beats with delight, 
Dear Irene;

And I've something sweet to tell, 
When we wander through the dell, 
Sweet Irene. 
CHORUS: 
Sweet Irene, ( Symp.,) dear Irene, ( Sytnp,), 
Gently Ivhisper, tell me darling, thou art mine; 
Sweet Irene, (Symp.), dear Irene, (Symp.), 
Gently whisper, tell me dearest, thou art mine. 
Underneath the old oak tree, 
Sweet Irene; 
I 
have whispered love to thee, 
Dear Irene; 
I 
said, I'd be here at eight, 
Down by the garden gate, 
For your answer to await, 
Sweet Irene.

Can you so soon forget me, 
You loved me once so well; 
You loved me in the Summertime, 
The Wintertime as well; 
You said you would never leave me, 
My love you would never forget; 
And often in our tales of love, 
I 
called you my dearest pet. 
CHORUS: 
In the evening when 'twas twilight, 
You've often sat beside me; 
Whispering love, my turtle dove, 
Can you so soon forget me; 
I'm fading like the flowers, 
That blushed and bloomed in Suma.or 
Dear is the vision that merrily recalls, 
Can you forget me so soon? 
Then my heart shall feel no trouble, 
My head shall feel no pain; 
Only to see thee, darling, 
And hear thy voice again. 
Just to press thy ruby lips, 
Your sunny face I 
see; 
Don't forget me, darling, 
Can you so soon forget met

My name is McNamara, 
And I 
came from County Clare, 
In the darling little Isle across the sea, 
Where the mountains and the hills, 
And the brooks and rippling rills, 
Are Nature's sweetest music all the day. 
Our little farm was small; it could not support us all 
Bo one of us was forced away from home. 
And I 
bade them all good bye, 
With a 
tear drop in my eye, 
And I 
sailed for Castle Garden all alone. 
Cuoitus. 
I'm an honest Irish lad, 
And of work I'm not afraid, 
If it's pleasure to you 1 
will sing and dance, 
Yes, I'll do anything you 
.say, 
If you will only name the day, 
When they'll give an honest Irish lad a 
chance, 
When I 
landed in New York, 
I 
tried hard to get work, 
Yes, I 
traveled through the streets from day to arty 
And I 
went from place to place, 
— With starvation in my fact, 
is 
HONEST IRISH LAD. 
(Continued). 
When lask for work they want no help, they say, 
Yet still I 
wandered on, 
In hopes I 
would find one, 
Who would give a 
lad a 
chance to earn his bread, 
But I 
find it's all the same, 
And I 
know I'm not to blame, 
And I 
often times have wished that I 
was dead. 
(Chorus.) 
But I 
know I 
have one kind friend, 
Who a 
helping hand will lend 
To a 
poor boy and help him on at home, 
And I'll bring my mother here, 
And my little sister, dear, 
And never from them more again I'll roam. 
I 
will try and do what's right, 
I 
will work both day and night, 
Yes, I'll try and do the very best :: can, 
And God will bless the heart 
That will take a 
poor boy's part, 
And make an honest Irish lad a 
man,

AN IRISHMAN'S DYING REQUEST. 
Composed by JAMES T. 
KELLY, and recited by K ELLY ct O'BRIEN ill 
their original act " Insanity." 
North, the gang upon the corner 
Has told me to lay down and die, 
My darling, go and hang up the baker 
For a 
piece of lmekelberry pie; 
My breath is getting very weak, 
Once, you know, it IN as so strong, 
So listen to my (lying request, 
For I 
know that I 
will not live long. 
Tell my brother, Herman Fagan, 
The poor man to-clay he got one year, 
Tell him when I 
go to Sandusky 
I'm going to give up drinking beer; 
Oh, the happy days we spent together, 
When we used to call each other chumps, 
No more we will parade the Bowery 
Dropping our hats on cigar stumps. 
Tell my red-headed hump-backed sister 
She ought to put herself in hock, 
She puts me in mind of a 
bag of peanuts, 
Or a 
hole in the heel of a 
woolen sock;

AN IRISHMAN'S DYING REQUEST—CONTINUED. 
Norah, our little clog has fleas, 
We must shake the dizzy pup, 
Come and kiss me when I'm dead, 
For then I 
know I 
won't throw up. 
Tell your father he's a 
darling, 
As a 
lusher he takes the cake; 
Tell him to buy some bad gin and tobacco 
So the gang can enjoy themselves at my wake; 
Tell him to sing the Starry Banner, 
For it 1 
carried many a 
night; 
Tell them all 1 
came from 
Cork, 
And that's the reason I'm flying light. 
Norah, part my hair in the middle, 
think my end is drawing near; 
I 
wish you would go to the corner gin mill 
And hang them up for a 
quart of beer. 
Farewell, darling, it's time I 
was dead, 
Good afternoon, oh, what do you say? 
If any one asks why I 
kicked the bucket 
Tell them I 
couldn't stay away.

Slang phrases come up every day, 
And we hear them on the street, 
But the latest one that I 
have heard, 
To you I 
will repeat; 
On Fifth Avenue Cother day, 
Some young bloods did begin, 
Saying, " Pipe the gal in the blue silk dress, 
And watch me take it in.. , 
Cuonus: 
Take it in! take it in! 
You bet I'll take it in. 
In churches, gin mills, thro' the town, 
Oh! everywhere we go, 
Among the sports that are known as fast, 
And the straight-laced known as slow; 
Oh! everyone and everywhere 
They each think it no sin 
To scoop up the thing that they like best, 
And straightway take it in. (Chorus). 
TAKE IT IN.—CONTINUED. 
Now the people in this world you meet 
Are various and strange; 
There's some that are free as mountain air, 
Whilst others do arrange 
To draw their purse strings tight, 
And swear they've got no tin, 
Like the jolly old cuss that keeps this house, 
Who always takes it in. 
Then there are ladies with faces long, 
Would have you think them good— 
How all temptation in this life 
They always have withstood; 
But if you saw their inner self, 
r11110. they look so meek and prim, 
Just give them a 
chance with a 
nice young man, 
how quickly they'll take it in. (Chorus). 
Now before I 
conclude my song, 
There's one thing I 
would name, 
And I 
mention it right publicly, 
Without any fear or shame; 
If any of you boys ask me now 
To a 
seltzer, beer or gin, 
You can bet your own dear, sweetest life, 
This darling takes it in. (Chorus).

III COCKALORUM, JIG, JIG, JIG. 
As sung with great success by Miss JENNIE HUGHES. 
In Harlem it was once my fate to see four little boys, 
Who, trying to enjoy themselves, kicked up an awful noise; 
The game th ey played was one which I 
had never seen before, 
But what drew my attention was to hear these urchins r(n.r. 
CHORUS. 
Hi Cockalorum, jig, jig, jig, 
Jig, jig, jig, jig, jig, jig, 
Classical language, don't you twig, 
Hi Cockalorum, jig, jig, jig. 
Returning to my friends to dine, I 
being a 
good young intuk, 
They asked me if I'd say the grace before the meal began) 
All eyes were closed, each head was bent, hands clasped 
style devout, 
I 
meant to say it proper, but instead I 
blurted out. 
CHORUS.—Hi 
Cockalorum, & c. 
Now, after this, most strange to say, the phrase ran in my 
head, 
And though I 
tried to banish it, it never, never fled; 
I 
took to drink, I 
tried the turf, balls, concerts, or the play, 
But no odds what the music was, to me it seemed to say. 
CHORUS.—Hi 
Cockalorum, & c. 
Each girl who used to think me nice, soon put me down k 
bore, 
Instead of warm receptions, I 
was cooly shown the door, 
At every such rebuff, of course, I 
asked the reason why 
And each bewitching damsel said in accents sweetly shy.

THE OLD FASHIONED HOME. 
Sang by NED BARRY at HARRIGAN & Hawes Theatre Comique, 
Broadway, New York. 
There's an old fashioned house in the old country, 
There's an old fashioned couple live there; 
There's an old fashioned gate by the old country road; 
And an old fashioned man near the chair; 
An old fashioned woman is sitting there, 
Darning an old pair of hose; 
With her old fashioned cap on her old fashioned heati 
And she's dressed in her old fashioned clothes. 
Cuonus: 
Hear those bells, those merry bells, 
And they fill my soul with a 
thrill; 
'Tis the old fashioned sound from them old fashioned bells. 
In that old fashioned church on the hill. 
There's an old fashioned clock on that old whitewashed 
wall, 
With its old fashioned pendulum and hands; 
There's an old wooden bench by that old fireplace, 
With its bright copper kettles and pans; 
An old fashioned man is sitting there, 
Smoking his old fashioned clay; 
With his old favorite dog sitting close by his side, 
Watching the children at play. 
Heaven bless that dear old pair, may they live for many 
years, 
In that dear, little house in the lane; 
May they never know a 
care, but all happiness to share 
And think of the dear, old happy days; 
The same I

heart of conscience true 
May you live, yes, for many, many years; 
May you never want for wealth, but enjoy the best of 
health, 
it is the earnest wish I 
give to you.

American Fortune-Telling Cards.—This is the old-

We have

These Cards are arranged and printed in series—Hearts. Clubs, Dia-
monds and Spades—ard each of these into K for King, Q for Queen, 
and K 
for Knave, and numbers 1, 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
four r6ws, and are to be read according to directions. Many of the an-
swers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. 
The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under 
standing. 
Many professional Furtune-Tellers use these cards, and we 
are in receipt of letters in relation to them from all parts of the II. S.

Courting Cards. — This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a 
way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too diffi-
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. 
The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unladylike encourage-
ment. 
As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless 
it accords 
w ith 
the state of their affections, which fact makes a 
further explanation un-
necessary. 
The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties 
Price 25 Cents.

when and where to do it." and this little volume would advise and initi-
ate the uncorrupted in practicing what is commonly called -flirting."
