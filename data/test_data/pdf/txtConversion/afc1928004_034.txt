That look so cool and nice, 
While all the swells come far and wide, 
For whiskey mixed with ice. 
They're found to go it while they can, 
Till pride does have a 
fall— 
They all admire that beauteous maid, 
The gal with the waterfall. 
She's a 
bully gal, etc. 
THL GAL WITH THE WATERFALL 
She goes about dressed up in silk, 
Distended by a 
hoop, 
And wears a 
cunning jockey hat, 
Shaped like a 
sugar scoop. 
And there is fastened on each side, 
A 
thing like a 
billiard ball— 
They're just a 
sign for you to look 
At the gal with with the waterfall. 
She's a 
bully gal, etc. 
The other night I 
chanced to stroll 
To Copeland's for ice cream, 
My feelings were beyond control, 
I 
thought it was a 
dream--
This angel she came floating in, 
For beans did loudly call ; 
I 
thought it quite a 
vulgar sin, 
For the gal with the waterflill. 
She's a 
bully gal, etc. 
The way she shoveled down the fruit, 
I 
tell you was not slow, 
And when she thought she had enough, 
She rose, and turned to go— 
When from her head there something fell, 
'Twas neither light nor small, 
The pepper caused this maid to sneeze, 
And she dropped her waterfall. 
She's a 
bully gal, etc. 
I 
quite politely picked it up— 
" 
Just give that here," she said, 
When she seized it with an angry frown, 
And clapped it on hcr head— 
She saw me laugh, and gave me a 
look 
That caused my flesh to 'crawl; 
She said, " Young man, beware how you fool 
With a 
lady's waterfall!" 
THAT'S SO TOO. 
THAT'S SO TOO." 
As sung by BILLY HOLMES. 
Aia—" Yankee Doodle."

But it didn't take the Yankees long 
To clear the rebels out, sir.

Yankee doodle is the tune, 
Americans delight in, 
'Twill do to whistle, sing or play. 
And just the thing for fighting. 
Jeff Davis undertook a 
thing, 
He couldn't get through his noodle, 
And now we'll make the critter sing, 
Hail Columbia, Yankee doodle. 
Hip, hip, hip, hurra! 
Yankee doodle dandy, 
We can lick the rebel crew. 
Whenever it comes handy. 
He who fights and runs away, 
May live to fight anew, sir, 
That is what the poets say, 
But then it isn't true, sir. 
Wake snakes! heads break! 
Everything is smashing; 
When the Yankees undertake, 
To give the " rebs" a 
thrashing. 
Uncle Jeff he took " leg bail," 
Without his hat and coat, sir, 
But instead of hoops around his tail, 
He'll have a 
rope around his throat, sir. 
Andy Johnson is a 
brick, 
As any one may see, sir, 
He'll hang the traitor by the neck, 
To a " sour apple tree," sir.

COURTING IN THE 'DARE. 
'COURTING IN THE DARK, 
Composed and sung by BILLY lior.mrs. 
Ain—" Bonnie Blue Flag.'' 
THERE'S fun alive where'er we go, 
And much we wouldn't miss ; 
A 
pic-nic is not very slow, 
There's music in a 
kiss. 
The girls, they all are charming f
i
nings, 
Quite ready for a 
lark, 
But nothing such true comfort brings 
As courting in the dark. 
Oh, when the old folks they retire, 
And bid us both good-night, 
They leave us sitting by the fire, 
To court by candle light: 
" 
Oh, snuff the candle, John,' says she, 
" 
Ere we commence to spark ;" 
The booby puts the candle out, 
And they court in the dark. 
And there they sit and talk of things, 
No matter what they- 
say. 
When midnight comes, the lady says, 
" 
Pray do not go away." 
And there they hug, and there they kiss, 
The old folks sing out " Hark ! 
What dreadful popping noik is that? 
They're courting in the dark." 
The old cat mews upon the hearth, 
The dog barks at the door, 
The daylight comes and finds thera there, 
Just half inclined to snore. 
But John can't tear himself away, 
"Fis such a 
pleasant lark ; 
They both do think it very gay, 
This courting in the dark. 
I'M NOT GREEN ENOUGH FOE THAT. 
At last they part, for John must go— 
, He leaves with grief and pain, 
But to console her in her woe, 
He says, " I'll come again." 
But as he leaves, the big bull dog 
Starts up with savage bark— 
The lover loses both coat-tails 
By courting in the dark. 
Now, ladies, put the candle out, 
For Cupid has no sight 
No matter if you frown or pout, 
When there's no tell-tale light, 
For then your whispers bring no blush, 
Your kisses leave no mark, 
And you can say such* 
tender things, 
While courting in the dark. 
FM NOT GREEN ENOUGH FOR THAT, 
• 
An Original Comic Song, 
Ais sung by DILLY Hoimns. 
Written by J. P. POOLE-
Ant—" Does your mother know you're out?" 
I'VE lately come to New York, 
To see the sights around, 
And many curious characters, 
About me I 
have found. 
There's some who think me rather green, 
And take me for a 
fiat, 
But when they try to take me in, 
I'm not green enough for that. 
Fol do rol, etc. 
I 
met a 
fellow the other dhy, 
And this he said to me, 
" 
I'll show you round without delay, 
And all the sights you'll see; 
12 
I'M NOT GREEN ENOUGH FOR THAT. 
So just tip out a 
ten or two." 
I 
saw what he was at— 
Says I, " My friend, excuse me, 
I'm not green enough for that." 
Fol de rol, etc. 
I 
went out to the races, 
A 
trotting match to see : 
A 
man at three card montc, 
Asked me to bet a 
V., 
Saying," Where the little joker is, 
You cannot tell, that's flat." 
Says I, " I'd bet, but then you see, 
I'm not green enough for that." 
Fol de rol, etc. 
The other day I 
met a 
man, 
He seized me by the wrist, 
" 
Here's a 
chance to be a 
brigadier, 
I 
want you to enlist ; 
Nine hundred dollars bounty, 
With a 
soldier coat and hat." 
Says I, " I 
doesn't see the point, 
I'm not green enough for that." 
Fol do rol, etc. 
I 
saw an advertisement, 
In the herald yesterday, 
" 
A 
gay young widow wants a 
man," 
I 
went without delay. 
She talked of loves, and turtle doves, 
As in the room we sat, 
But when she mentioned marriage— 
I'm not green enough for that. 
Fol de rol, etc. 
One evening as I 
sauntered out, 
I 
met a 
damsel young, 
She asked me for to see her home, 
Of course, I 
went along. 
PAT mi AMERICA.

But I 
found she knew a 
thing or two, 
And took me 
for a

Saying, " Come up stairs ;" " Oh no," says I, 
" 
I'm not green enough for that."

As sung by BILLY I
-
I0ImEs. 
Am—" Yankee doodle." 
I'M going to sing a 
simple song, 
It's one of my own making; 
Just list, I 
won't detain you long, 
For my heart is nearly breaking. 
Sure when I 
left ould Ireland, 
To come across the ocean, 
It never once came in my mind, 
To fight against secession. 
(Spoken.) Arrah! what the divil is that? 
Chorus. 
With my flail and hod shure on I 
trod, 
Like an Irish boy so frisky, 
For the divil a 
hair I 
care at all, 
About anything but whiskey.— 
Oh, the reason why I 
left the ould dart, 
And came across the sea, is 
Because John Bull, the dirty brat, 
Would give me nothing to eat but praties. 
For he taxed my cat and dogs, 
Also, my beef and mutton, 
He even ate up all my hogs,— 
Shure wasn't he a 
glutton? 
(Spoken.) Bad luck to his big belly, and my the divil 
pull it out of him red-raw. 
• With my flail, etc._ 
PAT IN All:CIZICA. 
When first I 
landed in New York, 
A 
gintleman quiet civil 
Says to me, " Pat, do you want to work, 
" 
Arrah, indeed I 
do, you divil." 
" 
Then come along with me," he said, 
"And I'll show you where there's plon:y. 
Where you will get good beef and bread, 
And monthly dollars twenty." 
(Spoken.) Then by jabers that's the place will suit mo 
exactly, avick. 
With my flail, etc.,„ 
Ho took me to a 
great bin. hall, 
Where they axed m e mcd'iat my name was ; 
Says I, " It's any thing at all 
If it'll only please the ladies." 
"Then come and sign it here, my boy, 
Upon this piece of paper ;" 
So off I 
went then in great joy, 
Au American by nature. 
(Spoken.) Yes, and by the eternal frost, I'm as good s 
Yankee now as any of yees. 
With my flail, etc. 
When I 
came out into the street, 
I 
met long Jimmy Barry: 
May the divil take me, Jim avick, 
If a 
hod again I'll carry, 
For it's sojering now I'll go in troth, 
And pitch them all to blazes— 
Witi my musket I 
will go down South, 
To try and catch Jeff Davis. 
(Spoken.) Ay, by the mortal man, if I'd, catch him it's 
my fortune I'd be making on him. 
With my flail, etc. 
When I 
came to join the corps, 
There was plenty of the boys there: 
PAT IN tornrao.k. 
Bould Barney Shea and Pat McGee, 
With Dunavan, and Tim More ; 
McGloughlin, too, was dressed in blue, 
Like a 
recruiting sargeant, 
None of the'craw was half so true 
An, the little LIZ:ies' darlint. 
(Spoken.) Shure I'm the breaking of all the Judys' 
hearts, so I 
am ; at all evince they tell me so, but what 
will the poor crathures do at all, if I 
get kilt in the army? 
the (Evil knows I 
know avick asthore. 
With my 
flail, etc. 
But now I'm free from all the law 
Of tyranny and oppression, 
And fighting for fair Freedom's cause, 
In the land of my adoption. 
Shure I'm the boy will never run 
From Johnny Bull or rebels— 
It's on the field I'd show them fan, 
And belt them like the (Evil. 
(Spoken.) Go long to blazes! ou'r that wid yecs, now, 
or I'll knock you sky high. 
With my flail, etc. 
So come with me now gramachree, 
To fight and beat the rebels, 
And if John Bull will interfere 
get into a 
hobble. 
But now I 
will conclude my song, 
For people think I'm crazy ; 
I 
hope I 
haven't kept you long-
03h, huroo for Corporal Casey! 
(Spoken.) I 
suopo!,e 
yees di ln't think I 
was it corporal 
in the army before, but I 
am, and I'll be a 
general too 
before long, if I 
can only get a

THE DEAD BEAT. 
As sung by BILLY Ilor.uES. 
Written by J. P. 
POOLE. 
Am—" Pretty Girl milking her Cow.” 
THERE was a 
young man in this city, 
No one could tell how he did live ; 
But if you'll list to my ditty, 
His history I'm going to give. 
He used for to dress in the fashion, 
And as he would walk through the stree 
The girls would cry, " Isn't he dashini!" 
They knew not he was a 
dead beat. 
A 
gay young codfish merchant's daughter. 
He used for to spark on the sly, 
A 
big thing on ice, too, he thought her, 
And to get at her fortune did try, 
So fondly he'd tell her his passion, 
As out every evening they'd meet ; 
'While her papa did never imagine, 
She fancied this healthy dead beat. 
He'd take her to Maillard's cr Taylor's, 
And treat her to everything fine, 
A 
game, supper, ice cream, or fried oyaer 
Washed down with a 
bottle of wine. 
And when the bill came to be settled. 
lied whisper in accents so sweet. 
"Just lend me your pocket-book, darling,' 
She'd hand it out to this dead beat. 
An elopement one day he suggested, 
And to this she gave her consent ; 
In a 
carriage his change he invested, 
To a 
North River steamboat they went. 
A 
detective they met on the pier, 
And these, are the words did them greet— 
"1 want you. my shover of queer." 
IL: arrested this healthy dead beat.

They brought the gal home in a 
passion, 
What horror her bosem how fills ! 
Augustus was tried the next session, 
For passing of counterfeit bills. 
They gave him a 
twelvemonth in prison, 
And there any day you may meet, 
Breaking stones, with the gang, in a 
quarry, 
This handsome, but healthy dead beat.

But if they catch you—hope they will— 
They'll hang you as a

Your mammy taught you better, 
ill all commands except the eighth, 
And that you would not let her. 
She should have whipped and spanked you well, 
And then you'd had some reason, 
To thank your stars, and garters too, 
That you were saved from treason.

As sung by BILLY Ikuat 
Ala--" Lannigan's .Ball." 
COME listen, all you Union tars, 
To my little home-made song, 
Composed for Admiral Farragut's fleet, 
By one of the Northern strong : 
For since we left Philadelphia, 
We have bravely proved our boast, 
That with our battery and brave crew, 
We would scourge the Southern coast. 
Fed lol lol, etc. 
Since McKinstry's loss at Port Hudson, 
In our captains we've had changes, 
Yet the captains of our pivot guns 
have never lost their ranges. 
The guerrillas killed brave Bead for us, 
And we'll make them curse the day 
The Monongahela and her crew 
Appeared off Mobile Bay. 
Poi lel lol, etc. 
August the fifth, of sixty-four, 
Will long remembered be, 
13y- rebels North, by rebels South, 
By land and far at sea ; 
For at six o'clock that morning, 
Our ships got under way. 
And our Father in Heaven watched Farragut, 
As he steamed for Mobile Bay.

At seven o'clock the forts let fly 
Their rifle shot and shell: 
Our monitors as soon reply, 
And their monster shot told well. 
The wooden fleet then opened, 
And our brave boys did their parts, 
Which indorsed our brave old Admiral's words, 
That his crow had iron hearts.

When the Mobile pet ram " Tennessee " 
Came Eteaufing swiftly down.

Our crew stood calmly watching her, 
We were not steaming fast ; 
She missed our bow, and steering round, 
Under our port quarter passed.

And gave the order, clear and loud,

And happy we were as a

THE DOUNTY JUMPER. 
But now all our fun it is ended, 
No wonder I 
feel very sore, 
With all of my greenbacks expended, 
A 
bounty in never jump more. 
I 
much liked the sport of enlisting, 
The people did load me with thanks, 
But mind you, I 
ne'er was insisting. 
On having a 
place in the rfnks. 
It was just my height of ambition 
To clap on the bounty my paw, 
And then I 
would shift my position, 
For I 
didn't approve of the war. 
flow foolish to brave every danger, 
Despising emotions of fear; 
To terror of death I'm a 
stranger, 
But I

Patriot I 
am, it i3 plain ; 
If war comes again, men inviting, 
With pleasure

But now I 
have lost my vocation, 
Forlorn round the city I 
shirk, 
I 
fear I 
must cull'er starvation, 
Or do just as bad—go to work. 
The thought of it drives MC half cra::y— 
take the political stump ; 
rknow I'm confoundedly lazy, 
But willing as ever to jump! 
Just pity my dreadful condition, 
I'll ask for relief on my 
knees ; 
Encourage my honest ambition, 
And stir up a

Just get up another big battle, 
And call for a 
million recruits, 
As soon as I 
hear the balls rattle, 
With joy I'lljump out of my boots.

And—" What will you do, love FI 
117nEuE shallikve go, love, to pass the season, 
In manner pleasing and in lots of sport ? 
I 
know a 
spot, love, I'll tell you what, love, 
In this city hot, love, we'll not be caught. 
'We'll bid defiance to the bold mosquitoes, 
No more they'll meet us on the nose or face; 
We'll snuff the breezes, and smell the tulips, 
And taste the juleps of the watering place. 
There's where we'll go, love, to live in clover, 
Our cares all over, and lots of wealth ; 
No speck of trouble need we ever borrow, 
We'll have no sorrow, and enjoy good health. 
Each blessed morning, just as we'd oiler, 
Six pints of water we'll drink with grace ; 
'Twill give us appetite to eat our dinner, 
We'll not grow thinner, at the watering place. 
When so disposed, love, we'll both go fishing, 
For pastime wishing, in a 
little sloop ; 
And many a 
fish of rarest kind shall crowd her, 
To make a 
chowder, or a 
pot of soup. 
On some lone rock, love, we'll do our cooking, 
Like gipsies cooking, or some foreign race, 
And home returning, we will grow quite frisky 
On a 
little whiskey, at the watering place. 
Then we'll go swimming, in nice bathing dresses, 
'Mid waves' caresses, on the ocean's brink ; 
Just like a 
mermaid, you'll have no fear, love, 
When I 
am near, love, you cannot sink. 
Should any lobster, or other foe, love, 
On your big toe, love, clasp his embrace, 
I'd fly to rescue, and with club or stick, love, 
Soon make him sick, love, of the watering place. 
THE MESH VOLUNTEEII. 
We'd have an appetite, and eat so hearty, 
And sonie nice party attend each night ; 
Perhaps sonic exquisite, with lots of money, 
As sweet as honey, you may conquer quite. 
Then don't be backward, but just go in, love, 
For lots of tin, love, it's no disgrace? 
Give me a 
share, love, just for a 
token, 
My heart's not broken, at the watering place. 
As sung by BILLY Homins. 
Ain—" Bonny Blue Mg. ,/ 
My name is Tim McDonald, I 
am an native of the Isle, 
I 
was. 
born among old Erin's boys, when I 
was but a 
child. 
My father fought in ninety-eight for liberty so dear. 
Inc fought and fell in Vinegar Hill like Irish Volunteer; 
Then raise the harp of Erin, boys, the flag we all revere, 
We'll fight and fall beneath its folds like Irish Volunteers. 
When I 
was driven from my home by an oppressor's 
hand, 
I 
cut my sticks and greased my brogne.s, came over to 
this land ; 
I 
found a 
home, I 
found some friends, and those that I 
loved dear— 
Ly jabers I'll stick to them like an Irish Volunteer. 
Then fill your glasses up, my boys, and drink a 
hearty 
cheer, 
To the land of our adoption, and the Irish Volunteer. 
Now when the traitors in the South, commenced this 
warlike raid, 
I 
quickly then laid down my hod, to blazes went my 
spade ; 
Then to a 
recruiting onto I 
went that happened to be 
near, 
DAVIS'S BALL. 
And found the good old sixty-ninth, like an Irish Vol-
unteer. 
Then fill the ranks and march away, no traitors do we 
fear, 
We will drive them all to blazes, says the Irish Volunteer. 
When the Prince of Wales came over here, and made a 
hullabaloo, 
Oh everybody turned out in style in gold and tinsel too, 
But then the good old Irish boys didn't like these lords 
and peers, 
They would not give a 
cent for kings, these Irish Volun-
teers, 
They love the land of liberty, its laws they will revere, 
But blazes take nobility, says the Irish Volunteer. 
Now fill your glasses up, my boys, a 
toast come drink 
with me, 
May Erin's harp and starry flag, united ever be, 
May rebels quake, and traitors shake, and tremble in 
their fears, 
When next they catch the Yankee boys, and Irish Vol-
unteers. 
God bless the name of Washington, that name this land 
reveres, 
Success to Meagher and Nugent, and the Irish Volun-
teers. 
DAVIS'S' BALL. 
As sung by BILLY 110LMES. 
Ala--" Lannigan's Ball) , 
FAR down in the South there lived Jeffy Davis, 
He swindled his friends till the they hadn't a 
pound ; 
Secession he thought would make him a 
man again. 
Leave him a 
fortune, and plenty of ground. 
24 
DAVIS'S BALL. 
He gave a 
large party to friends and relations, 
That stood by his side, on treason to call, 
And if you'll but listen, I'll make your eyes glisten 
With the promises made for Davis's Ball. 
Chorus— Whack fol lol, etc. 
Himself and his wife gave a 
free invitation, 
To all of the chivalry, first to the last; 
In less than an hour they had plenty of traitors 
All drinking their whiskey like bees round a 
cask. 
Says he to the army, " Now march into Washington, 
Be there on the Fourth, on Lincoln to call; 
Give out my cards to the great Yankee nation, 
To make themselves ready for Davis's Ball." 
Whack fol lol, etc. 
He called on to Lee to start up the music, 
Then upon Ewell to lead on the van; 
Longstreet and Hill will ford the Potomac, 
And lrive all the Yankees from our Maryland. 
We'll dine on the best of the Cumberland Valley, 
And take enough home to last us for years ; 
And when we have feasted we'll make a 
grand rally, 
And drive to the North, those old volunteers. 
Whack fol lol, etc. 
They all started off in the best of good humor, 
And drinking together, to Gettysburg came ; 
Wen an accident happened to the whole rebel army, 
They routed, and ran from the Yankees again. 
Says Lee to his men, "Ve must be mistaken, 
They have found out my 
plans, and the road we have 
lost. 
I 
am afraid we are whipped, now save your own bacon, 
I 
never would have come, had I 
counted the cost." 
Whack fol lol, etc. 
I 
don't like the tune those Yankees are playing, 
The old Yankee doodle they give us so fine; 
We have got a 
bad whipping, there's no use denying, 
The best we have had, since Davis's time. 
SCENE AT THE BOW-STREET POLICE COURT. 
Some took to their heels, and fled to the mountains, 
And others upon their knees did fall, 
And begged for their lives, to save them the trouble, 
Of leaving their tickets for Davis's Ball.

TUE DYING SOLDECII AT ANTIETAM. 
THE DYING SOLDIER AT ANTIETAM 
As sung by BILLY HOLMES. 
AIR—" Bonaparte crossing the Alps.” 
A. soup= of the Union lay dying in the field, 
There was lack of woman s 
nursing, and lack of woman's 
tears ; 
But a 
comrade stood beside him whilst his life blood 
ebbed away, 
And bent with pitying glances to hear what he might 
say. 
The dying soldier faltered as he took his comrade's 
hand, 
And said I 
never more shall see my own, my native 
land; 
Take a 
token or a 
message to some distalit friends of 
mine, 
For I 
was born in Kentucky, Kentucky on the line. 
Tell my brothers and companions when they meet and 
crowd around, 
To hear my mournful story in some pleasant woodland 
ground, 
That I've fought the battle bravely, and when the day 
was won, 
Full many a 
corpse lay gasping pale, beneath the setting 
sun. 
Amid the dead and dying was some grown old in wars, 
Their death wounds on their silent hearts, and a 
list of 
many sears; 
But one was young, who suddenly beheld life's morn 
decline, 
And he was born in Kentucky, Kentucky on the line, 
Tell my mother that her other son shall comfort her old 
age, 
For I 
was a 
gay and truant bird that thought my home 
a 
cage: 
My father was a 
soldier too, and even when a 
child, 
TILE DYING SOLDIER AT ANTIETAM. 
31 
lly heart leaped forth to hear him tell of strange things 
fierce and wild ; 
And when he died and left us to divide his scanty hoard, 
I 
let them take whatever they had, but I 
kept my 
father's sword! 
With boyish love I 
hung it where the bright light used 
to shine, 
On the cottage walls in Kentucky, Kentucky on the line. 
Tell my sister not to weep for me, nor sob with droop-
ing head, 
When the troops are returning home with a 
soft and 
gallant tread : 
But to look upon them proudly, with a 
calm and stead-
fast eye, 
For her brother was a 
soldier, and not afraid to die! 
And if a 
comrade seeks her love,I ask her in my name, 
To listen to him kindly, without regret or shame ; 
And to hang the old sword in its place, my father's 
sword, and mine, 
For the honor of old Kentucky, Kentucky on the line, 
There is 
another, not a sister, in the happy days 
gone by, 
You might have known her by the merriment that 
sparkled in her eye. 
Too innocent for coquetting, too proud for idle scorning, 
Oh! friends, I 
fear the lightest heart oft makes the heav-
iest mourning! 
Tell her the last night of my life, that ere the moon 
had risen, 
My body will be out of pain, my soul be out of prison -: 
I 
dreamed I 
stood beside her, and saw the bright light 
shine, 
As it shone in old Kentucky, Kentucky on the line. 
I 
saw the blue stream sweep along, I 
heard her sing 
songs dear, 
The Union songs we used to sing, in voices sweet and 
clear; 
32 
ink! BROTH OF A BOY. 
And down the pleasant valley, and up the slanting 
That echoing chorus sounded through the evening calm 
and still ; 
Her glad blue eyes were on me as we paced with friend-
ly talk, 
Down many streams beloved of yore, and well remem-
bered walks ; 
Her little hands lay gently, confidingly in mine, 
But we'll meet no more in Kentucky, Kentucky on the 
line. 
His voice grew faint and weary, hi3 manly form grew 
weak, 
His eyes put on a 
dying look, he sighed, and ceased to 
speak. 
His comrade went to raise him up, but the spark of life 
had fled, 
A 
soldier of the Union, in the Union cause lay dead. 
'he silver moon rose brightly, and calmly it looked 
down, 
On the red sands of the battle field, with bloody corpses 
strewn. 
But calmly on that dreadful scene the pale moon 
seemed to shine, 
As it shone on distant Kentucky, Kentucky on the line.

Since first the world began. 
With whiskey in their heads, and shillalahs in their fists : 
Like divils they'll fight, d'ye see, 
They'll never say they're kilt until they're murthered

poor lad in Ireland 
is breaking his heart for your sake. 
It's folly to keep you from going, 
Though, faith, it's a 
mighty hard case: 
For, Kathleen, you know there's no knowing 
When next I 
shall see your swath face. 
And when you come back to me, Kathleen, 
None the better will I 
be off then : 
You'll be speaking such beautiful English, 
Sure I 
won't know my Kathleen again. „ 
35 
Ay, now, where's the need of this hurry ? 
Don't flusther me so in this way; 
I 
forgot, 'twixt the grief and the flurry, 
Every word I 
was maning to say. 
Now just wait a 
minute, I 
bid you ; 
Can I 
talk if you bother me so ?-

Kathleen, my blessing go wid ye, 
Every inch of the way that you go. 
NEARSARGE AND ALABAMA. 
As sung by BILLY TIOL3IES. 
Written by SILAS W. 
STEEL: 
I SnsT4 the doom and dark career, 
Of the rebel pirate, made to steer, 
And plunder our ships, both far and near, 
The terrible "Alabama!" 
She was built by "neutral Johnny Bull," 
Who threatened Yankee ears to pull, 
Because they dealt in nigger wool, 
Though cotton filled his pockets full. 
But when Rebellion showed its face, 
Brave Mr. Bull soon "changed his base," 
And on the sly, to his disgrace, 
Built the rebels Alabamas! 
Chorus. 
Launch and arm upon the sly, 
flit Uncle Sam, but do it shy, 
But you couldn't shut up his eye. 
For he sunk your Alabama! 
She roved the ocean fierce and free, 
And changed her flag in every sea, 
Upon our un-armed ships to prey. 
This valiant Alabama! 
Our cruisers sought her round and round, 
She dodged them like a 
dastard hound, 
Until her name was quite renowned, 
As a 
witch-craft never to be found. 
But the bold Kearsarge got in her wake, 
And kept her track without mistake, 
Till in Cherbourg port, coiled like a 
snake, 
She found the Alabama! 
Rob and plunder night and day. 
Scuttle or burn, then skulk away, 
But you've a 
reckoning yet to pay, 
My valiant Alabama! 
Famed Captain SeMM,CS was in a 
plight, 
He found there was no chance for flight, 
So he must either yield or fight, 
With his terrible Alabama! 
So he piped up his pirate crew, 
Of French and English, fierce and true, 
Say:s he, " We'll put the Kearsarge through," 
And sink her with all France to view. 
But Win-slow famed for win-ning fast, 
Soon nailed'our stars unto the mast, 
While his btave crew shouted, like a 
blast, 
Death or the Alabama! 
Load away, fire away, shot and shell, 
That's the tune brave tars to tell, 
Stand by, and let her rip pall mell, 
Death or the Alabama! 
Now larboard and starboard seven rounds, 
With our 32's and 100 pounds, 
We shook the French who lined the ground, 
To cheer the Alabama! 
We struck her 'neath the water line, 
And through her hull let in the brine, 
Till through the smoke we saw a 
sign, 
That we had crippled her in the spine. 
A 
shout resounded from our crew, 
38 
IL 
MARCHING ALONG. 
A 
cock upon our smoke-stack flew, 
And in his " cock-a-doodle-do "— 
Cried " How are you, Alabama!" 
Load away, fire away, etc. 
Another broadside made her " cave," 
She stood for France her wreck to save, 
When down she sunk into the wave, 
used-up Alabama. 
We lowered boats to save the crew, 
And could have nabbed the captain too, 
But her tender "Deerhound" hove in view 
And stole our prisoners, not a 
few. 
But there's a 
reckoning yet to come, 
We'll make these sympathizers hum, 
Give them what Paddy gave the drum, 
As we did the Alabama! 
a Here's to our navy true, 
To Winslow and brave Thornton too, 
And three cheers for the hrsarge crew, 
That sunk the Alabama. 
MARCHING ALONG. 
As 
sung by BILLY HOLmEs. 
THE army is gathered from near and from far, 
The trumpet is sounding the call for the war; 
McClellan's our leader, he's gallant and strong, 
We'll gird on our armor, and be marching along. 
Marching along, we are marching along, 
Gird on the armor, and be marching along; 
McClellan's our leader, he's gallant and strong, 
For God and our country we're marching along. 
The foe is before us, in battle array, 
But lot us not waver nor turn from the way; 
TO THE WEST. 
39 
The Lord is our strength and the Union's our song. 
With courage and faith we are marching along. 
Marching along, we are marching along, 
Gird on the armor and be marching along ; 
McClellan's our leader, he's gallant and strong, 
For God and our country we're marching along. 
We sigh for our country, we mourn for our dead, 
For them now our last drop of blood we will shed ; 
Our cause is the right one, our foe's is the wrong, 
Then gladly we'll sing as we're marching along, 
Marching along, we are marching along, 
Gird on the armor and be marching along; 
McClellan's our leader, he's gallant and strong, 
For God and our country we're marching along. 
Our wives and our children we leave in your care, 
We know you will help them their sorrows to bear ; 
'Tis hard thus to part, but we hope 'twon't be long, 
We'll keep up our hearts as we're marching along. 
Marching along, we're marching along, 
Gird on the armor and be rharchin,g along; 
McClellan's our leader, he's gallant and strong. 
For God and our country we're marching along. 
The flag of our country is floating on high, 
We'll stand by the flag till we conquer or die; 
McClellan's our leader, he's gallant and strong, 
We'll gird on the armor and be marching along. 
Marching along, we are marching along, 
Gird on the armor and be marching along ; 
McClellan's our leader, he's gallant and strong, 
For God and our country we're marching along.

To the West, to the West ; I 
have been there, do you see, 
One visit, I'm sure, was sufficient for me, 
For the things that I saw there, they frightened me 
quite, 
And ever since then, sir, I've scarcely been right. 
My children got sick every day, sir, almost, - 
My wife got the chills ; got deaf as a 
post. 
There are some may exult, but for me, sir, I'm blest, 
If you ever again catch me at the West. 
To the West, etc. 
To the West, to tilt West, where the rivers that flow, 
Are full of great big crocodiles, you know, 
And the snakes in the forest make you feel mighty queer, 
And you don't see a 
bar-room not twice in the year. 
To the West, etc. 
And if across the prairies you happen to go, 
You're sure to get tossed by a 
wild buffalo ; 
Where the lakes are like children, they're never at rest, 
Ton my soul, then I 
soon got enough of' the West. 
To the West, etc. 
Oh, they told me at the West, there was wealth to be won 
A 
forest to clear, was the work to be done, 
I 
tried it, couldn't do it, gave it up in despair, 
And I'm blowed if you ever again catch me there. 
To the West, etc. 
For the snug little farm, I 
intended to buy, 
I 
quickly discovered ' twas all in my eye, 
I 
came back like a 
streak ; you can go, but I'm blest, 
If you ever again catch me at the West.

I 
AM saucy Sam, a 
Southern fig, 
As you can plainly see: 
I 
was born among the cotton fields, 
'Way down in Tennessee. 
Old master used to wallop me, 
So I 
cut my stick and ran, 
The soldiers they caught hold of me, 
And they made me a 
contraband. 
Chorus. 
Then if you will listen, white folks, 
I 
will tell you of a 
plan, 
For I 
am a 
bully nigger, 
And my name is saucy Sam. 
I 
read in the papers the other day, 
For to make the army bigger, 
Congress it had passed a 
law 
To go and draft the nigger. 
The niggers they'll pick cotton, 
And they'll do it very freely, 
But when they smell them bullets, 
How they'll run for Horace Greeley. 
Then if you will listen, etc. 
I 
wish the white folks of the North 
And South would listen to me ; 
I 
would tell them that the best way was, 
To let the nigger be; 
Hang the traitors, North and South, 
And with aloud huzzas, * 
Cry, Constitution as it is, 
And Union as it was.

Ant—" Yankee Volunteers." 
On, welcome home, ye heroes all, 
With your honorable scars; 
You've fought and, bled in Union's cause, 
And held up the stripes and stars. 
Through many a 
battle you have passed, 
Without delay or fears, 
And now we greet you home at last, 
Our Veteran Volunteers. 
'When stern rebellion threatened us, 
You hastened to the field, 
And there, through many a 
bloody fight, 
You never yet did yield. 
All welcome to that gallant band, 
We'll give three rousing cheers, 
For those that saved our darling land, 
Our Veteran Volunteers. 
Our enemies are overthrown, 
Subdued are all our foes, 
Jeff Davis, sitting all alone, 
Playing checkers with his nose. 
The Southerners have ceased to spout, 
No more we see their sneers, 
The fact is, they are all played out, 
By Veteran Volunteers. 
We see the rebels on their knees, 
Asking pardon for their crimes, 
Saying, " Mr. President, if you please, 
Forgive us just this time !" 
They know that they do well deserve 
To lose their lengthy ears,— 
What brought them to their senses, were 
Our Veteran Volunteers.

ALL PEDDIYUS. 
Hurrah for our brave volunteers, 
That put rebellion down; 
Their memory shall be preserved, 
With credit and renown. 
The girls are glad to see them back,

And never will refuse a 
smack 
To Veteran Volunteers. 
MANKIND ARE ALL PEDDLERS. 
Composed and sung by BILLY HOLMES. 
AIR—" Things I 
don't like to see." 
M ANKIND are all peddlers, that you may see, 
If you don't like my argument, listen to me, 
And a 
song I 
will sing and a 
story I'll tell, 
That shows every man has got something to sell, 
And also the ladies have many a 
smile, 
They will sell to you cheap, if you think it worth while., 
Just put down your greenbacks, and plant down your 
gold, 
And you'll find that yourselves are confoundedly sold. 
The doctor's a 
peddler—as soon as you're sick, 
He peddles out pills that will kill you off quick : 
Then the old undertaker steps up with a 
grin, 
And peddles a 
box, for to put yourself in. 
Then a 
fellow with gravestones is sure to come round, 
To peddle a 
slab for to -stick in the ground ; 
And your heirs fight about you before you are cold, 
And that is the way you're confoundedly sold. 
The lawyer's a 
peddler, he peddles out law, 
lie gives you much Latin, and great deal of jaw, 
He ruins your foe, but he pockets your pelf, 
And takes all the cash and the spoils to himself 
ON THE VEATN". 
If you ask him for law, he will give you enough 
Of writs and subpcenas, and that kind of stuff; 
If you ask him for justice, he'll think you are bold, 
And says, " My dear friend, you're confoundedly sold. 
The great politician, he peddles out lies, 
Believed by the foolish, yet scorned by the Wise ; 
He calls our dear country his darling and pet, 
And peddles out wind, a 
fat °ince to get. 
He advocates fighting, but don't stir his shanks 
To take his position at all in the ranks : 
If you ever expect that his name is enrolled, ' 
My innocent friend, you're confoundedly sold. 
The author, he peddles some one else's idea, 
While the actor, he peddles poor murdered Shakspeare, 
The editor peddles items to raise an alarm, 
While I 
peddle music, the people to charm. • 
We all peddle something, and that without fail, 
Every man on this earth has got something for sale ; 
If you think all that glitters is sure to be gold, 
I 
tell you my friend, you're confoundedly sold.

The cove that spouts.” 
ALL people, both young and old, 
Have got a 
hobby to ride ; 
The timid and the bold, 
And those stuffed up with pride. 
From Jersey. that foreign land, 
From Florida to Maine, 
The inhabitants all, you understand, 
Have something on the brain. 
ON THE BRAIN. 
A 
young man woefully sighs, 
His feelings are'so warm— 
We see him turn up his eyes, 
Like a 
duck in a 
thunder storm: 
He kisses an ambrotype, 
The matter is very plain, 
For suicide he is ripe, 
lie's got love upon the brain. 
We often times do meet 
A 
lady both young and fair, 
She takes up one half the street 
With someboly else's hair. 
A 
hat like a 
skillet reversed, 
Scarce keeps her head from the rain, 
Her complaint is one of the worst, 
She has waterfall on the brain. 
We sometimes meet with a 
friend 
WM 
looks uncommon blue, 
He asks us if we can lend 
A 
small sum for a 
day or two. 
We tip him a 
trifle of shitr, 
And never behold it again, 
The matter is plain enough, 
There's forgetfulness on the brain. 
A 
politician cloth spout 
For his country right or wrong, 
At Faneuil Hall we hear him shout, 
And pitch in good and strong. 
To Washington city he goes, 
In the fastest railroad train, 
And the President very well knows 
He has office on the brain. 
Then there is a 
widow bewitched, 
Considered quite a 
prize— 
She's anxious to be enriched, 
And gain a 
husband besides.

With damages on the brain. 
THE HALLS OF MEXICO. 
Original, as sung by BILLY HOLMES. 
COMRADES all, respond to the call, 
join our ranks, both great and small, 
We'll roll along great Freedom's ball 
'Co the halls of Mexico. 
There we'll say to the Spanish Dons, 
" 
Here we are, the Union sons, 
Bold and brave, and fearless ones 
In the halls of Mexico." 
Maximilian, he will stare, 
For his fright we do not care, 
We're bound to do the thing that's fair, 
In the halls of Mexico. 
Louis Napoleon may send his troops, 
Fond of frogs made up in soups, 
Ready to rob the chicken coops 
In the halls of Mexico. 
But we'll try to block his game, 
Bring him down to grief and shame. 
And establish the Yankee name 
In the halls of Mexico. 
For there's nothing there of his— 
We don't like the looks of his phiz, 
Stay at home and mind your 
From the halls of Mexico. 
France must have no foothold here, 
That's a 
notion sounding queer, 
if she stays ' twill cost her dear, 
In the halLs of Mexico. 
We don't want these foreign powers 
On this continent of ours, 
Visiting our land in showers, 
And the halls of Mexico.. 
So we think you'd better go, 
And don't be so very slow, 
Over the river, Johnny Crapeau, 
From the halls of Mexico. 
In former times, great General Scott. 
When the battle it was hot, 
Conquered by his shell and shot 
The halls of Mexico. 
We will enter just the same, 
Trying to play a 
peaceful game, 
But prepared to hold our claim 
In the halls of Mexico. 
When the ladies hear the rumors, 
They will come, dressed up like bloomers, 
To revel with the Montezumas, 
In the halls of Mexico.

THE PIPER, OR TERRY O'ROON, 
As 
sung by BILLY H OLMES. 
Ocia! there ne'er was a 
piper like Terry O'Roon, 
Sure he bother'd them all with his wonderful tune ; 
And the like of that same, when it came in his head, 
It never was equaled by living or dead. 
And this is the reason—a 
long time ago, 
As Terry's own family histories show— 
A 
fairy once brcolght to his grandfather's cot 
The very same pipes that now Terry has got; 
" 
And sure," said his father, who took up the trade, 
"St. Patrick himself on the same may have played ;" 
But none of the pipe-playing house of O'Roon, 
Like Terry could strike up the wonderful tune, 
Och bothering, wheedling Terry O'Roon, 
He charmed every heart with his wonderful tune. 
'Tis said when he struck up his pipes by the shore. 
That the fishes danced jigs, and the sea ceased to roar. 
That the rocks split with laughing, that herrings and 
sprats 
Should foot it with shell-fish, and round fish, and flats. 
Be that as it may, Terry swears that it's true, 
But he might have been dreaming, betwixt me and you : 
t) 
OCUlAR DEMONSTR TION. 
49 
On a 
taste of the creature—that caused him to think, 
(For pipers have ever been jewels to drink ;) 
And Terry himself, when the whiskey was strong, 
ne'er played so well, nor so.loud, nor so long 
Till he set them all dancing—sly Terry O'Roon, 
And whatever he played 'twas a 
wonderful tune. 
Och bothering, wheedling, etc. 
There was never a 
wake, -nor a 
fight, nor a 
fair, 
But Terry O'Roon he was sure to be there : 
And many's the match that was made, I'll be bound, 
When his wonderful pipes drew the lassies around ; 
But Terry himself was a 
rogue, and it's true, 
It was all one to him whether black eyes or blue, 
For when his flirtations some beauty would vex, 
" 
Arrah, honey!" he says, " ain't I 
true to the sex?" 
And so he went on with his wheedling ways, 
And his pipe-playing tricks to the end of his days ; 
But there ne'er was a 
piper like Terry O'Roon, 
That was gifted, like him, with a 
wonderful tune! 
Och bothering, wheedling Terry O'Roon, 
Sure he won every heart with his wonderful tune! 
OCULAR DEMONSTRATION, 
Written by S. 
LOVER. 
As sung by BILLY II OLmES. 
IN 
the days of creation, when Jove was allotting, 
The duty each part should supply, 
To the tongue he gave words to assist us in plotting. 
And vigilance gave to the eye. 
But Juno, Jove's mandates would ne'er be obeying, 
His laws she made woman defy, 
Said, the tongue should keep guard over what they ware 
saying, 
And speaking be done by the eye. 
3 
MOTHER, HE'S GOING AWAY. 
But the great law of Nature so strongly endued 
The tongue of the woman, dear soul, 
That it would not be quiet, do all that she could, 
And ran quite beyond her control ; 
While her eyes, flashing brightly-, determined to keey 
Its gift from the queen of the sky. 
Till between them, with many an argument deep, 
The quarrel soon ran very high. 
At last ' twas agreed an appeal to the sky 
Should be made in a 
matter so nice, 
And this compromise sly, 'twixt the tongue and the eye. 
Was agreed on by Jove's own advice; 
" 
My daughters, thus nicely the balance I've hung, 
'Twixt the rivals," the Thunderer cries, 
"Let woman to woman converse with her tongue, 
But speak to a 
man with her eyes."

When Barney flew over the hills to his darling, 
And rapp'd at the window where Katy did lie.

It's whiskey, not love, has got into your head.

And the words of my Katy shall comfort and bless me,— 
No, Barney avourneen, I

THE IRISH GIRL. 
As 
sung by HILLY H OLMES. 
ONE evening, as I 
stray'd down the river side, 
Looking all around me, an Irish girl I 
spied, 
So red and rosy were her cheeks, and ycllow was her 
hair. 
And costly were the robes which my Irish girl did wear. 
Her shoes of Spanish leather, were bound round with 
spangles big, 
The tears came down her crystal eyes, and she began to 
say, 
Och, hone, and alas! store areen mocree, 
Why should you go and leave me, and slight your own 
Molly ? 
The first time that I 
saw my love, I 
was sick and very 
had; 
All the request I 
asked was that she might tie my head! 
I 
asked her if one as bad as me could ever mend again, 
For love's a 
sore disorder—did you ever feel the pain ? 
My love she'll not come nigh me for all the moan 
make, 
Nor neither will she pity me, if my poor heart should 
break, 
But was I 
of some noble blood, and she of low degree, 
She would hear my lamentations, and come and pity me.

She has a

She's the promise of this country, like Venus in the air, 
And let her go where'er she will, she's my joy and only

De it so or be it not, of her I 
take my chance, 
The first time that I

Her ruddy lips and sparkling eyes have so bewitched

I 
wish I 
was a 
butterfly, on my love's breast I'd lie, 
Or was I 
but a 
linnet, how I 
would sing and fly, 
Or if I 
was a 
corn-creak, I'd sing till morning clear, 
I 
would sit and sing for Molly, for once I 
loved her dear. 
If my love was a 
red rose in yonder garden fair, 
And I 
to be a 
gardener, of her I 
would take care : 
There's not a 
month throughout the year, but my love 
would renew, 
With flowers fine I'd garnish, with sweet-william, thyme 
and rue, 
If I 
was in Monaghan, and sitting on the grass, 
And in my hand a 
bottle, and on my knee a 
lass : 
I'd call for liquors plenty, and I'd pay before I 
go, 
Come on, they say, my brave boys, let the wind blow 
high or low.

NANNY, WILT THOU GO WITH ME? 
Written by T. Pinter, D. D. 
As sung by BILLY HOLMES. 
0 NANNY, wilt thou go with me, 
Nor sigh to leave the flaunting town? 
Can silent glens have charms for thee— 
The lowly cot and russet gown? 
54 
PAT MALT  
OY. 
No longer dressed in silken sheen, 
No longer decked with jewels rare,— 
Say canst thou quit each courtly scene, 
Where thou wert fairest of the fair? 
0 
Nanny, when thou'rt far away, 
Wilt thou not cast a 
7,-ish behind ? 
Say, canst thou face th:., parching ray, 
Nor shrink before the wintry wind? 
Oh, can that soft and gentle mien 
Extremes of hardship learn to bear, 
Nor sad regret each courtly scene. 
Where thou wert fairest of the fair? 
0 
Nanny, canst thou love so true, 
Through perils keen with me to go ; 
Or when thy swain mishap shall rue, 
To share with, him the pangs of woe ? 
Say, should disease or pain befall, 
Wilt though assume the nurse's care, 
Nor wistfal those gay scenes recall, 
Where thou wert fairest of the fair? 
And when at last thy love shall die, 
Wilt thou receive his parting breath— 
Wilt thou repress each struggling sigh. 
And cheer with smiles the bed of death? 
And wilt thou o'er his breathless clay 
Strew flowers and drop the tender tear, 
Nor then regret those scenes so gay, 
Where thou wert fairest of the fair? 
PAT MALLOY. 
As sung by HILLY HOLMES. 
AT 
sixteen years of age I 
was my mother's fair haired 
boy, 
She kept a 
little huckster shop, her name it was Malloy; 
PAT MALLOY.

"Fre fourteen children, Pat," says she, " which heaven 
to me has sent, 
But children ,ain't like pigs, you know, they cannot pay 
the rent. ' • 
She gave me every shilling that there was in the till, 
And kissed me fifty time s 
ormore, as if she'd never get 
her fill, 
" 
Oh, heaven bless you, Pat!" says she, " and don't for-
get., my boy, 
That ould Ireland is your country, and your name is 
Pat Malloy." 
Oh, England is a 
pretty place, of goold there is no lack; 
I 
trudged from York to London wid me scythe upon 
me back ; 
The English girls are beautiful, their loves I didn't 
decline, 
The eating and the drinking too is beautiful and fine, 
But in a 
corner of me heart, which nobody can see, 
Two eyes of Irish blue are always peeping out at me. 
0 Molly darling never fear, I'm still your own dear 
boy, 
Ould Ireland is me country, and me name is Pat Malloy; 
From Ireland to America, across the seas I 
roam, 
And every shilling that I 
get, and shure I 
send it home ; 
Me mother couldn't write, but oh! there came from 
father Boyce, 
" 
Oh, heaven bless you, Pat!" says she,—I 
hear me 
mother's voice. 
But now I'm going home again, as poor as I 
began, 
To make a 
happy girl of Moll, and share I 
think I 
can. 
Me pockets they are empty, but me heart is filled wid 
joy, 
For ould Ireland is me country, and me. name is Pat 
Malloy..

THE WEARING OF THE GREEN. 
A 
Street Ballad-1793. 
As sung by BILLY H OLMES. 
Am—" Benny Havens." 
I'm a 
lad that's forced an exile 
From my own native land, 
For an oath that's passed against me 
In this country I 
can't stand ; 
But while I'm at my liberty 
I 
will make my escape. 
I'm a 
poor distressed croppy 
For the green on my cape! 
For the green on my cape! 
For the green on my cape! 
I'm distressed—but not disheaxtened— 
For the green on my cape! 
THE WEARING OF THE GREEN. 
But I'll go down to Belfast 
To see that seaport gay, 
And tell my ivied parents 
In this country I 
can't stay. 
Oh, 'tis dark will be their sorrow— 
But no truer hearts I've seen, 
And they'd rather see me dying 
Than a 
traitor to the green! 
Oh, the wearing of the green! 
Oh, the wearing of the gnen! 
May the curse of Cromwell darken 
Each traitor to the green! 
When I 
went down to Belfast, 
And saw that seaport grand, 
My aged parents blessed me, 
And blessed poor Ireland. 
Then I 
went unto a 
captain 
And bargained with him cheap-
Then forward stepped young Boney, 
And took me by the hand, 
Saying—' How is old Ireland, 
And how does she stand Y" 
"It's as poor distressed a 
nation 
As ever you have seen, 
They're hanging men and women there 
For wearing of the green! 
For wearing of the green! 
For wearing of the green 
They're hanging men and women, too, 
For wearing of the green! 
Take courage, now, my brave boys, 
For here you have good friends, 
And we'll send a 
convoy witn you 
Down by their Orange dens ; 
And if they should oppose us, 
With our weapons sharp and keen, 
, 
He told me that his whole ship's crew 
Wore green on the cape! 
Oh the green on the cape! 
Oh the green on the cape! 
God's blessing guard the noble boys 
With green on the cape! 
'Twas early the next morning 
Our gallant ship set sail, 
Kind heaven did protect her 
With a 
pleasant Irish gale. 
We landed safe in Paris, 
Where victualing was cheap— 
They knew we were united, 
We wore green on the cape! 
We wore green on the cape! 
We wore green on the cape! 
They treated us like brothers 
For the green on the cape! 
We'll make them rue and curse the day 
That e'er they saw the green! 
That e'er they saw the green! 
That e'er they saw the green! 
We'll show them our authority 
For wearing of the green! 
0 
may the wind of Freedom 
Soon send young Boney o'er, 
And we'll plant'the Tree of Liberty 
Upon our shamrock shore ; 
Oh we'll plant it with our weapons 
While the English tyrants gape, 
To see their bloody flag torn down 
By green on the cape! 
Oh the wearing of the green! 
Oh the wearing of the green! 
God grant us soon to see that day, 
And freely wear the green! 
THE WEARING OF THE GREEN, 
SECOND VERSION. 
As sung by J. 
H. 
GLENNY, in the drama of " Arrah no. rogue." 
THEY'VE trampled on poor Ould Ireland, 
And made the stones to weep ; 
And many a 
man they've hunted down, 
Lies in his long, last sleep! 
The English they have done all this, 
Our best blood they have shed : 
Father and son lie side by side, 
Mothers and daughters are dead! 
But they cannot kill the shamrock, 
Of patriot signs the queen : 
And they cannot stop an Irishman 
From wearing of the green! 
TILE WEARLN.G OF THE GREEN. 
They may shed our blood, and make the land 
The wildest ever seen ; 
But every blade of grass pluck up, 
Before they kill the green! 
Then, listen to what I 
say, bhoys, 
And mark well what I 
mean: 
As long as there's breath in our bodies, 
We'll all of us wear the green! 
THE WEARING OF THE GREEN, 
THIRD VERSION. 
As sung by BILLY HOLMES. 
FAREWELL, for I 
must leave thee, my own, my native 
shore, 
And doomed in foreign lands to dwell, may never see 
thee more ; 
For laws, onr tyrant laws have said, that seas must 
roll between 
Old Erin and her faithful sons, that love to wear the 
green, 
Oh we love to wear the green! 
Oh how we love to wear 
the green, 
Our native land we cannot stand, for wearing of the 
green ; 
Yet wheresoe'er the exile` lives, though oceans roll 
between, 
Thy faithful sons will fondly sing, " the wearing of the 
green." 
My father loved his country, and sleeps within her 
breast, 
While I, that would have led for her, must never be so 
blest; 
Those tears my mother shed for me, how bitter had 
they been, 
If I 
had proved a 
traitor to " the wearing of the green." 
CO 
STTEMI7S O'BRIEN. 
There were some who wore the green, who did betray 
the green, 
Our native land we cannot stand, through traitors to the 
green. 
Yet whereso'er our fate may be, when oceans roll 
between, 
Her faithful sons will ever sing, " the wearing of the 
green." 
My own, my native island, where'er I 
chance to roam, 
Thy lonely hills shall ever be my own beloved home; 
And brighter days must surely come, than those that we 
have seen, 
When Erin's sons may gladly sing, " the wearing of the 
green." 
For we love to wear the green, oh how we love the 
green! 
Our native land we cannot stand for wearing of the 
gre; 
But brighter days must surely come, than those that we 
have seen, 
When all her sons may proudly sing, !‘ the wearing of 
the green." 
SHE31.138 O'BRIEN, 
A 
Tale of' Ninety-eight, as related by an Irish Peasant. 
BY J. S. LEFANti. 
As sung by BILLY HOLMES. 
31ST after the war, in the year ninety-eight, 
As soon as the boys wor all scattered and bate, 
'Twas the custom, whenever a 
peasant was got. 
To hang him by trial—barrin' such as was shot. 
There was trial by jury goin' on by daylight, 
And the martial law hangin' the lavings by night. 
It's them was hard times for an honest gossoon ; 
If he missed in the judges he'd meet a 
dragoon: 
sunmus o'Brumf. 
61 
And whether the sojers or judges gave sentence, 
The devil a 
much time they allowed for repentance; 
And the many a 
fine boy was then on his keepin', 
With small share of restin' or sittin' or sleepiu'. 
And because they loved Erin, and scorned to sell it, 
A 
prey for the bloodhound, a 
mark for the bullit— 
Unsheltered by night and unrested by day, 
With the heath for their barrack, revenge for their pay. 
And the bravest and honestest boy of thim all 
Was Shemus O'Brien, from the town of Glingall; 
His limbs wor well set, and his body was light, 
And the keen-fanged hound had not teeth half as white. 
But his face was as pale as the face of the dead, 
And his cheek never warmed with the blush of the red; 
And for all that he wasn't an ugly young boy, 
For the devil himself couldn't blaze with his eye. 
So droll and so wicked, so dark and so bright, 
Like a 
fire-flash that crosses the depth of the night; 
And he was the best mower that ever has been, 
And the elegantest hurler that ever was seen. 
In fencin' he gave Patrick Mooney a 
cut, 
And jumpin' he bate Tom Molony a 
foot; 
For lightness of foot there was not his peer, 
For, by heavens! he almost outrun the red deer, 
And his dancin' was such that the men used to stare, 
And the women turn crazy, he did it so quare; 
And sure the whole world gave in to him there! 
And it's he was the boy that was hard to be caught, 
An' it's often he ran, an' its often he fought, 
An' it's many the one can remember quite well 
The quare things he did, and it's oft 1 
heerd tell 
How he frightened the magistrates in Cahirbally, 
An' escaped through the sojers in Aherloe valley, 
62 
surzros O'BRIEN. 
An' leathced the yeomen, himself agen four, 
An' stretched the four strongest on old Galtimor ,
.). 
But the fox must sleep sometimes, the wild deer must 
rest, 
And treachery prey on the blood of the best; 
An' many an action of power an' of pride, 
An' many a 
night on the mountain's bleak side, 
An' a 
thousand great dangers an' toils overpast, 
In darkness . of night he was taken at last. 
Now Shemus look back on the beautiful moon, 
For the door of the prison must close on you soon ; 
An' take your last look at her dim, misty light, 
That falls on the mountain and valley to-night. 
One look at the village, one look at the flood, 
An' one at the sheltering far-distant wood : 
Farewell to the forest, farewell to the hill, 
An' farewell to the friends that will think of you Ain. 
Farewell to the patthern, the hurlin', an' wake, 
An' farewell to the girl that would die for your sake! 
An' twelve sojers brought him to Maryborough 
An' with irons secured him, refusin' all bail. 
The fleet limbs wor chained and the sthrong hands wor 
bound, 
And he lay down his length on the cold preson ground, 
And the dhrames of his childhood kern over him there, 
As gentle and soft as the sweet summer air; 
An' happy rimimbrance croTlin' an ever, 
As fast as the foam flakes (Thrift down an the river, 
Bringin' fresh to his heart merry days long gone by, 
Till the tears gathered heavy an' thick in his eye. 
But the tears didn't fall, for the pride iv his heart 
Wouldn't suffer one dhrop down his pale cheek to start; 
An' he sprang to his feet in the dark preson cave, 
An' he swore with a 
fierceness that misery gave; 
STIF:LITIS 
By the hopes iv the good an' the cause iv the brave, 
That when he was mouldering in the cowld grave, 
His mimics never should have it to boast 
His scorn iv their vengeance one moment was lost. 
His bosom might bleed, but his cheek should be dhry, 
For undaunted he lived, and undaunted he'd die. 
PAI:T SECOND. 
(13 
Well, as soon as a 
few weeks were over an' gone, 
The terrible day of the trial came on ; 
There was such a 
crowd there was scarce room to stand, 
An' sojers on guard, an' dragoons sword in hand. 
An' the court-house so full that the people were bothered. 
An' attorneys an' criers on the point of being smothered; 
An' counselors almost gave over for dead, 
An' the jury sittin' up in the box overhead. 
An' the judge settled out so determined an' big, 
An' the gown on his back, an' an elegant wig, 
An' silence was call'd, an' the minute ' twas said, 
The court was as still as the heart of the dead. 
An' they heard but the opening of one prison-lock, - 
An' Shemus O'Brien kern into the dock— 
For one minute he turned his eyes round on the throng, 
An' then looked on the bars, so firm and so strong. 
An' he saw that he had not a 
hope nor a 
friend, 
A 
chance to escape, nor a 
word to defend ; 
An' he folded his arms as he stood there alone, 
As calm and as cold as a 
statue of stone. 
An' they read a 
big writin', a 
yard long at least, 
An' Shemus didn't see it, nor mind it a 
taste, 
An' the judge took a 
big pinch of snuff, an' he says, 
" 
Are you guilty or not, Jim O'Brien, if you please?"

SITEMIIS O'BRIEN.. 
An' all held their breath in silence of dread, 
An' Shemus O'Brien made answer and 
"said 
My lord, if you ask me if in my life-time 
I 
thought any treason, or did any crime, 
That should call to my cheek, as I 
stand alone here, 
The hot blush of shame or the coldness of fear, 
Though I 
stood by the grave to receive my death-blow, 
Before God an' the world I 
would answer you No! 
But if von would ask me, as I 
think it like, 
If in the rebellion I 
carried a 
pike, 
An' fought for ould Ireland, from the first to the close, 
An' shed the heart's blood of her bitterest foes— 
I 
answer you YES: an' I 
tell you again, 
Though I 
stand here to perish, it's my glory that then 
In her cause I 
was willin' my veins should rtm dry, 
An' that now for her sake I 
am ready to die." 
Then the silence was great, and the jury smiled bright, 
An' the judge wasn't sorry the job was made light ; 
By my soul its himself was the crabbed ould chap ! 
In a 
twinkle he .pulled on his ugly black cap. 
Then Shemus's mother, in the crowd standin' by, 
Called out to the judge with a 
pitiful cry, 
" 
Oh judge, darlin', don't,— oh don't say the word! 
The crathur is young—have mercy, my lord! 
You don't know him, my lord! oh don't give him to 
ruin! 
He was foolish—he didn't know what he was doin', 
He's the kindliest erathur, the tinderest hearted 
Don't part us forever, we that's so long parted! 
Judge mavourneen, forgive him—forgive him, my 
An' God will forgive you— oh! don't say the word!"--
That was the first minute O'Brien was shaken. 
When he saw that he was not quite forgot or forsaken! 
1"1 
snrzros o'Br,rEN. 
65 
An' down his pale cheek, at the word of his mother, 
The big tears were running, one after the other, 
An' two or three times he endeavored to spake, 
But the strong manly voice used to falter an' break. 
But at last, by the strength of his high-mounting pride, 
He conquered an' mastered his grief's swelling tide ; 
An' says he, " Mother, don't—don't break your poor 
heart, 
Sure, sooner or later, the dearest must part. 
An' God knows its better than wandering in fear, 
On the bleak trackless mountain among the wild deer, 
To be in the grave, where the heart, head an' breast, 
From labor an' sorrow for ever shall rest. 
Then mother, my darlin', don't cry any more— 
Don't make me seem broken in this my last hour : 
For I 
wish, when my heart's lyin' under the raven, 
No true man can say that I 
died like a 
craven." 
Then toward the judge Simmus bent down his head, 
An' that minute the solemn death-sentence was said. 
DART THIRD. 
The mornin' was bright, an' the mists rose on high, 
An' the lark whistled merrily in the clear sky,— 
But why are the men standing idle so late? 
An' why do the crowd gather fast in the street? 
What come they to talk of? what come they to see? 
An' why does the long rope hang from the cross tree? 
Oh Shemus O'Brien, • pray fervent an' fast, 
May the saints take your soul, for this day is your last. 
Pray fast an' pray strong, for the moment is nigh, 
When strong, proud, an' great as you are, you must 
die!— 
At last they drew open the big prison gate, 
An' out came the sheriffs an' sojers in state. 
£' 
66 
grmlarS O'BRIEN. 
An' a 
cart in the middle, an' Shemus was in it— 
Not paler, but prouder than ever, that minit, 
An' as soon as the people saw Shemus O'Brien, 
Wid prayin' an' blessin', an' all the girls cryin', 
A 
wild wailin' sound kern on all by degrees, 
Like the sound of the lonesome wind blowin' through 
trees! 
On, on to the gallows the sheriffs are gone, 
An' the car an' the sojers go steadily on. 
An' at every side swellin' around of the cart, 
A 
wild, sorrowful sound that would open your heart. 
Now under the gallows the cart takes its stand, 
An' the hangman gets up with a 
rope in his hand. 
An' the priest havin' blest him, gets down on the 
ground, 
An' Shemus O'Brien throws one look around. 
Then the hangman drew near, and the people grew still, 
Young faces turn sickly, an' warm h€ arts turn chill; 
An' the rope bein' ready, his neck was made bare, 
For the gripe of the life-strangling cords to prepare; 
An' the good priest has left him havin' said his last 
prayer. 
But the good priest did more—for his hands he un-
bound, 
An' with one darin' spring Jim has leaped on the ground! 
Bang! bang! go the carbines, an' clash go the sabres : 
He's not down! he's alive! now attend to him heighbors! 
By one shout from the people the heavens are shaken,— 
One shout that the dead of the world might awaken : 
Your swords they may glitter, your carbines go bang, 
But if you want hangin' Jtis yourselves you must hang. 
To-night he'll be sleepin' in Aherloe glin, 
An' the devil in the dice if you catch him agin; 
1 
SHEAII7S O'BRIEN. 
67 
The sojers run this way, the sheriffs run that, 
An' Father Malone lost his new Sunday hat. 
An' the sheriffs were both of them punished sevarely, 
An' fined lab the devil, because Jim done them fairly. 
A week after this time, without firm' a 
cannon, 
A 
sharp Yankee schooner sailed out of the Shannon; 
An' the captain left word he vas goM' to Cork, 
But the devil a 
bit—he was bound for NAN, York. 
The very next spring—a 
bright mornin' in May,— 
An' just six months hfter the great hangin' day,— 
A 
letter was brought to the town of Kildare, 
An' on the outside was written out fair :— 
" 
To ould Mrs. O'Brien, in Ireland, or elsewhere." 
An' the inside began—" My dear good ould mother, 
I'm safe, an' I'm happy—an' not wishin' to bother 
You in the radin'—with the help of the priest— 
I 
send you inclosed in this letter, at least 
Enough to pay him an' to fetch you away 
To the land of the free and the brave—Amerikay! 
Here you'll be happy, an' never made cryin' 
As long as you're mother of Shemus O'Brien. 
Give my love to sweet Biddy, an' tell her beware 
Of that spalpeen who calls himself ' Lord of Kildare ; 
An' just say to the judge, I 
don't now care a 
rap 
For him, or his wig, or his dirty black cap. 
Au' as for the dragoons—them paid men of slaughter— 
SaY I 
love them as well as the devil loves holy water. 
An' now, my good mother, one word of advice— 
rill your bag with potatoes,an' bacon, an' rice. 
An' tell my sweet Biddy, the best way of all 
Is now an' forever to leave ould Glengall, 
An' come with you, takin' a 
snug cabin berth, 
An' bring us a 
sod of the ould shamrock earth.

MY PRE1  JANE. 
An' when you start frem ould. Ireland take passage at 
Cork, 
An' come straight across to the town of New York ; 
Am' there ask the Mayor the best way to go 
To the town of Cincinnati—the State of Ohio : 
An' there you will find me, without much tryin', 
At the ' Harp an' the Eagle,' kept by Shemus O'Brien."

My pretty Jane, my dearest Jane, 
Ah, never look so shy, 
But meet me, meet me in the evening, 
When the bloom is on the rye.

The summer nights are coming, love, 
The moon shines bright and clear.

A.h never look so shy, 
But meet me. meet me in the evening, 
While the bloom is on the rye.

And the village bells shall ring.

FILVE heard the marvis singing 
Its love song to the morn : 
I've seen the dew- drops clinging 
To the rose just newly born : 
But a 
sweeter song has cheered me 
At the evening's gentle close, 
And I've seen an eye still brighter 
Than the dew-drop on the rose. 
'Twas thy voice, my gentle Mary, 
And thy artless, winning smile, 
That made this world an Eden, 
Bonnie Mary of Argyle. 
Though thy voice may lose its sweetnes 
And thine eye its brightness too, 
Though thy step may lack its swiftness, 
And thy hair its sunny hue, 
Still to me wilt thou be dearer 
Than all the world shall own ; 
I 
have loved thee for thy beauty, 
But not for that alone. 
I 
have watched thy heart, dear Mary, 
And thy goodness was the wile 
That has made thee mine forever.

I'd lay me doun and dee. 
Like dew on the gowan lying 
is the fa' o' her fairy feet ; 
And like winds in summer sihing, 
Her voice is low and sweet ; 
Her voice is low and sweet, 
And she's ail the world to inc ; 
And for bonnie Annie Laurie 
I'd lay me doun and dee. 
HOME, SWEET HOME. 
As sung. by DILLY HOLMES. 
'M ID pleasures and palaces though we may roam, 
Be it ever so humble there's no place like home ! 
A 
charm from the skies seems to hallow us there, 
Which seek through the world, is ne'er met with 
where. 
Home! home! sweet home ; 
There's no place like home ; 
An exile from home, splendor dazzles in vain! 
Oh! give me my lowly thatched cottage again! 
71 
The birds singing gaily that come at my call, 
Give me peace of mind that's dearer than all. 
Home! home! sweet home! 
There's no place like home! 
THE MISTLETOE BOUGH. 
As sung by DILLY HOLMES. 
TrrE misletoe hung in the castle hall, 
The holly-branch shone on the old oak wall, 
And the Baron retainers were blithe and gay, 
Keeping their Christmas holiday. 
The Baron beheld with a 
father's pride 
His beautiful child, young Lovel's bride, 
While she with her bright eyes seemed to be 
The star of the goodly company. 
Oh the misletoe bough. 
vy.1 " I'm weary of dancing," now  
she 
cri
ed, 
" 
Here tarry a 
moment, I'll hide, 111 hide ; 
And Lovel, be sure thou'rt the first to trace 
The clue to my secret lurking-place." 
Away she ran, and her friends began 
Each tower to search and each nook to scan, 
And young Lovel cried, " Oh where dost thou hide ? 
I'm alone without thee my owr dear bride." 
Oh the mistletoe bough. 
They sought her that night and they sought her next 
day, 
And they sought her in vain when a 
week passed away; 
in the highest., the lowest, the loneliest spot, 
else- 
Young Lovel sought wildly, but found het not. 
And years flew by— their grief at last 
Was told as a 
sorrowful tale long past; 
And when Lovel appeared, the •children cried, 
"See, the old man weeps for his fitiry bride." 
Oh the mistletoe bough, 
Er,nt ITAVOTJENEEN. 
At length an oil-Chest that had long lain hid, 
Was found in the castle— they raised the lid, 
And a 
skeleton form lay mouldering there, 
In the bridal wreath of that lady fair. 
Oh, sad was her fate—in sportive jest 
She hid from her lord in the old oak chest ; 
It closed with a 
spring— and, dreadful doom, 
The bride lay clasped in her living tomb. 
Oh the mistletoe bough. 
ERIN HAVOULNEEN. 
As sung by BILLY floutEs. 
WuEN the pure sense of honor shall cease to inspire thee, 
And kind hospitality leaves thy gay shore ; 
When the nations that know thee no longer admire thee, 
Then, Erin mavourneen, I'll love thee no more. 
When the trumpet of fame shall cease to proclaim thee 
Of warriors the nurse, in the ages of yore, 
When the muse, and the record of genius disclaim thee, 
Then, Erin mavourneen, I'll love thee no more. 
When thy brave sons no longer are 
And cease to be loved by the fair 
When thy daughters no longer are 
Then, Erin mavournecn, 
love 
THE END. 
generous and witty, 
they adore, 
virtuous and pretty, 
thee no more.
