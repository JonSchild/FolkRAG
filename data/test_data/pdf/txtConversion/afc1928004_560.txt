BILLY'S MOTHER-IN-LAW. 
Written by FT,tANK DtiMONT and sung by BILLY BIRCH at the San Fran-
cisco Minstrels' Opera House. 
W ILL some one invent or tell of a 
plan 
To get rid of my mother-in-law— 
Some stuff that will kill her as dead as a 
nail— 
I 
won't stand her abuse any more. 
I'm covered with scars and with liniment too, 
And court-plaster's all over my jaw ; 
She'll douse me in a 
tub if I 
dare to resist, 
And she takes me to scrub up the floor. 
CHORUS. 
She's a 
hunkey old mother-in-law--
She's a " daisy " old mother-in-law ; 
She's the crankiest old " crow " that ever you saw, 
Is the buzzard that Billy calls mother-in-law. 
If home I 
return and the hour is late 
Not a 
word of excuse she will bear, 
But gives me a 
sockdolager right in the eye, 
And bites off a 
chunk of my ear. 
I 
can't give her taffy, no matter how sweet; 
Her hand's like the fighter, Jem Mace ; 
Whenever she hits me on top of my nose 
She spreads it all over my face. 
She's a 
hunkey old mother-in-law, etc. 
The house is as hot and as warm as a 
stove 
Whenever she's " bossing " around ; 
She gives me a 
wink, and I 
shut up at once, 
For I 
dare not to utter a 
sound. 
Bullets won't pierce this old crocodile's skin ; 
I'd rather be living in jail; 
I 
go around town like a 
big yellow dog 
With a 
tin kettle tied to his tail. 
She's a 
hunkey old mother-in-law, etc.

MOTHER DEAR, 
GOOD '
NIGHT.. 
Sung by STANLEY GREY. 
DEAR mother, when my prayer is said, 
Before you take the light, 
Oh, lean your head so closely down, 
And bid me soft good night ; 
For I 
am happier in my dreams, 
And sleep with sweeter rest, 
If I 
have laid my lips to thine, 
And thine to mine are pressed, 
CHORUS. 
Kiss me for everything I 
love, 
The beautiful and bright; 
Dear mother, kiss me once again ; 
Good night, good night, good night. 
One kiss, dear mother, for the love 
My heart keeps warm for thee, 
And one for all the tenderness 
Thy dark eyes look to me 
Kiss me for some poor orphan child 
To whom no kiss is given ; 
A 
kiss, dear mother, for thyself, 
And now fer one in heaven. 
Kiss me for everything, etc. 
COME WHERE THE MOONBEAMS LINGER 
4 
Sung by STANLEY GREY. 
COINFE where the moonbeams linger, 
Come to the fairy scene, 
Come where the pale light falleth 
Iu soft and silvery sheen 
There I 
will softly whisper 
My heart's fond love to thee, 
That fading years can never change 
Whate'er my lot may be. 
Come where the moonbeams linger 
And rippling waters play ; 
Come when the day hath faded, 
With footsteps light and gay, 
Where the bright stars shine above us 
And we breathe our heart's fond vow 
That truth alone may guide us 
Where'er on earth we go.

NEVER TO MEET AS FRIENDS AGAIN. 
Words by FRANK. D UMONT. 
Music by W. S. MuLLALy. 
As sung by the San Francisco Minstrels. 
For sale at all music stores, price 40 cents. 
NEvraz to meet as friends again, 
Always to dwell apart, 
Gone are the words I 
treasured, 
And sacredly kept in my heart. 
Passing me by in silence, 
As if we had never seen 
Moments and hours of gladness 
That seem like a 
happy dream. 
Can you forget the old times ! 
And know what a 
world of pain 
To meet as strangers always, 
But never as friends again. 
CHORUS. 
Passing me by in silEnce, 
As if we had never seen 
Moments and ! lours of gladness 
That seem like a 
happy dream. 
Can you forget the old times 
And know what a 
world of pain 
To meet as strangers, always, 
But never as friends again? 
• 
Never to meet as friends again. 
Tho' years may come and go, 
Never to hear a 
welcome, 
When my heart is bowed down with ircto. 
Just like a 
drooping flower, 
Receiving the morning dew ; 
Lingering in thy presence, 
Thinking a 
days we knew ; 
Only a 
dream of old times, 
And vows that were made in vain, 
Meeting as strangers always, 
But never as friends again. 
Passing me by, etc.

The hoar is nigh when from you I 
must go;

You never will forget me, though waves roll between Ink 
Your image will follow wherever I 
go; 
But true to my colleen I'll come o'er the ocean, 
Back to the land where the shamrock does grow_ 
When o'er the oeeau 'mid strangers I 
wander, 
Think of my sadness I 
felt day by day; 
That you cannot cheer me, for you can't be near me, 
But time, then, my darling, must soon pass away. 
Then with my heart throbbing wildly with pleasure, 
Safe in your arms, love, again ue'er to go; 
Then will our days be the bright days of sunshine, 
Safe in the land where the shamrock does grow. 
Yon never will forget me, eta. 
MY BABY. 
AS 
sung by CHARLEY BACKUS at the San Francisco Minstrels' Opera 
House. 
I'm the father of an infant 
Baby mine, baby mine ; 
He won't let me rest an instant, 
Baby mine, baby mine; 
TT 
won't do a 
thing he's bid, 
Ilow I 
wish that I 
was rid 
Of that awful sassy kid, 
Baby mine, baby mine, 
Of that awful sassy kid, 
Baby mine. 
At my meals I 
have to hold him, 
Baby mine, baby mine ; 
How I 
never dare to scold him, 
Baby mine, baby mine ; 
My face he'll surely scratch, 
And the table- cloth he'll snatch,. 
All my crockery goes to smash, 
Baby mine, baby mine, 
All my crockery goes to smash, 
Baby mine. 
He's a 
pimple on his nose, 
Baby mine, baby mine ; 
And we wash him with a 
hoses 
Baby mine, baby mine ; 
You'd ought to hear him roar, 
And I 
have to walk the floor, 
And I'd like to break his jaw,. 
Baby mine, baby mine, 
Yes, I'd like to break his jaw, 
Baby mine. 
In my hair he often lingers, 
13.1by mine, baby mine ; 
,uolasses on his fingers, 
Baby mine, baby mine ; 
To hear him cry it is a 
sin, 
To quiet him we'll begin, 
Till at last we find a 
pin 
Sticking in baby mine,. 
Till at last we find a 
pin. 
Baby mine..

OPEN UP DEM DOORS. 
Great Shout Song, sung by Haverly's Minstrels. 
Words and Music by NED STRAIGHT. 
Copyright, 1880, by Mrs. PAULINE LIEDER. 
All rights reserved. 
I'sE gwine to write a 
letter 
To my great Jehovah, 
I 
want to know de time 
When de boat am going over. 
I'se got a 
quill from an angel's wing, 
'T was sent to me by de great good King. 
An angel dropped a 
tear in my hand, 
'Twas silver ink at de King's command. 
For a 
sheet ob paper a 
cloud he sent, 
So I'll write Him a 
letter and get his consent to— 
CHORUS. 
Open up dem doors, 
Oh ! break off de binges. 
Open up dem doors, 
Keep 'em open, 0 ! Lord. 
Fling dem doors wide open, 
For I 
want to get a 
glimpse inside: 
Fling 'em open, for 
I 
want to get a 
glimpse inside, 
Dat tear turned to a 
ribber, 
Down de mountain flowing, 
gwine to build a 
raft, 
On to Jordan I 
am going. 
So from de cloud I 
will make a 
boat, 
And down de stream I 
is gwan to float; 
De silver quill I'll take for a 
mast, 
I'll blow my horn wid a 
Gabriel blast, 
Den I'll done go butcher my fattest calf, 
And I'll send to de Ruler a 
quick telegraph to— 
Open up dein doors, etc.

THE SMILE THAT PLAYS. 
The smile that plays -ou woman's cheeks 
The sigh which breaks her rest, 
Though bright or sad, but ill bespeak 
The feelings of her breast; 
They may some anxious thoughts imparts 
But those who -ve most relied, 
linow not the love of woman's heart, 
Until that heart be tried- . 
There may, in her uncertain smile, 
Some token be of grief, 
some impulse which may, for awhile, 
in sorrow seek relief : 
But Tiaryse who m-st have watched the pr_11-, 
Portray'd by hope or pride, 
Know least the love at woman's heart 
Until that heart 'NI tried.

BILLY'S DREAM BOOK. 
As suny by BILLY Btnen at the San Francisco Minstrels' Opera House-. 
Broadway and 23th street. 
Somr people say that dreams have their signs and mean-
ings too, 
And I'll prove they're not wrong altogether ; 
If you dream of a 
bald-headed alligator's ghost, 
Its a 
sign that your nose will get redder ; 
If you dream you're eating mush, or you're chewing a 
cord of wooth 
It's a 
sign that you'll soon have the horrors or the shakes ; 
If you dream a 
cross-eye'd cat plays a 
yellow clarionet, 
You're lucky if you do no find your boots are full of 
" 
snakes." 
CHORUS. 
Oh, be careful how you dream and remember ev'ry sign, 
For ev'ry dream I've told you, I've experienced in my 
mind. 
I 
dreamod that stocks were up and I 
bought a 
thousand 
shares. 
I 
was shaving with an old paper collar, 
And hungry Doctor Tanner was mixing up the lather, 
'Twas a 
sign that I'd win every dollar. 
Jay Gould he gave me a ' put,'' and Russell Sage a " call," 
I 
played it for a " full " to be healthy in the fail. 
I 
threw my " margin " freely, and I bought 'em with a 
dash, 
My margin in the morning had shrunk to a 
plate of hash. 
Oh, be careful, etc. 
If you dream you comb your hair with a 
shovel or a 
rake, 
You wake up and find yourself a-lying on the floor ; 
It's a 
sign of a 
fight, and the slathering you'll get, 
If you dare to say ' boo " to your mother-in-law. 
If a 
lady dreams a 
flea lifts a 
camel by the ear, 
Or a 
frog's wearing spectacles pretending that he's blind, 
It's a 
sign that her husband will buy her a 
sealskin saccin-. 
A 
new bonnet, diamond ear- rings, all in clusters,—in lii3 
mind.

WHAT SHOULD MAKE THEE EAT, MY DAR-
LING ? 
As sung by ED. FRENCH. 
linAT should make thee eat, my darling, 
Pork and beans and mutton stew, 
Ham and veal, and roasted turkey, 
Hearts and livers, kidneys too, 
Sour krout, sausages, and limburg, 
Eggs and oysters, bread and crust 
If you do not quit your gorging, 
Darling, you will surely bust. 
Beets and turnips you devour, love, 
Sweet potatoes take your eye, 
Cucumbers, cabbages, and string-beans, loves 
Heavy on your stomach lie; 
Quail on toast and prairie chicken 
Taste so lovely, so you say; 
I 
should think so, for you eat, love, 
Sixteen good square meals a 
day. 
Pickled eel's feet, stewed canaries, 
Pig's feet broiled in kerosene, 
Elephants stuffed with sarsaparilla, 
Donkey's ears with pork and beans, 
Beeswax fried in black molasses, 
Oysters stuffed with Arctic whales, 
Or frogs in glue prepared in fine cut, 
Hoopskirts broiled on monkey's tails,

Sung by Cues. BACKUS at the San Francisco Minstrels' Opera House. 
I'VE one little failing I 
hope you'll excuse, 
That is, when requested I 
cannot refuse ; 
The source of my sorrow, the cause of my woe 
Is lacking the courage to boldly say " no," 
So listen to me and I'll try to amuse you, 
Telling my troubles to you if I 
can-
You all know my failing—I 
cannot refuse you, 
I'm such a 
very agreeable young man. 
CHORUS. 
So make it a 
rule wherever you go, 
Never say " yes " when you mean to say " no," 
But do a 
good turn for a 
friend if you can, 
If you want to be called an agreeable young man. 
I 
jumped on a 
car that was going up- town, 
My clothes wringing wet and the rain coming down, 
I 
slid into a 
seat, but the conductor with ease 
Says " Will you give up your seat to this lady ? Do, 
please." 
On the platform I 
stand, juA to show all my kindness, 
With the rain on my back trickling down to my toe, 
I 
lose my gold, watch—get a 
cold for my blindness— 
But what could I 
do ? I 
couldn't say no. 
So make it a 
rule, etc. 
At the charity ball in the winter I'm there, 
Whispering love to sweet Isabel Clare, 
About to propose, floor- manager will come 
And whisper " Miss Musty—will you please see her 
home ?" 
The cars have stopped running, I 
raise my umbrella, 
With an old maid of sixty I 
trudge through the snow, 
Leaving my rival to flirt with dear Bella, 
But what could I 
do ? I 
couldn't say no. 
So make it a 
rule, etc.

OH, 
FRED, 
TELL TT-
TTIM TO STOP I 
Sung by SQL SMITH RUSSELL. 
No doubt you have heard of the great Fancy Fair 
That used to take place ev'ry day; 
Well, I 
thought for amusement I'd take my girl there, 
To pass a 
dull hour away. 
We went in, you must know, and saw Richardson's show, 
And Wombwell's Menagerie as well; 
There were roundabouts, swings, and all kinds of things, 
Forget the day I 
never shall. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, when we got into the Fair my girl 
wanted to have a 
ride on one of the roundabouts. I 
said, 
"All right, my darling," and we had a 
swing; but di-
rectly the swing went to and fro she lustily called out-
CHORUS. 
" 
Oh, Fred, tell them to stop I" 
that was the cry .of 
Maria; 
But the more she said " Wo," they said " Let it go," 
And. the swing went a 
little bit higher. 
The people that stood 'round, of course they all laugh'd, 
But I 
only said, " Stop the swing." 
There were four or five others in the boats besides us, 
Saying, " Master, don't do such a 
thing," 
Then four or five roughs caught hold of the ropes, 
Maria fell down on her knee, 
And one of them said, " The young man's turning red, 
But isn't he having a 
spree." 
" 
Oh, Fred, tell them to stop," etc. 
They soon stopped the swing, and Maria got out, 
And quickly fell down on the floor ; 
They brought her some water, which soon brought her 
to— 
This girl whom I 
now do adore. 
Should you ever go there, to the great Fancy Fair, 
Friends, take advice whilst I 
sing 
Of the great roundabout, it's the best fun that's out, 
And finish the day with a 
swing. 
SPOICEN.—Mark, now, before you go into the swing 
boat make a 
bargain with your young lady not to call 
''i. Fr 
e0 
thpm to stop "

NOT BEFORE PA, DEAR. 
Sung by W . 
E. 
LYLE. 
SOME lovers are so bashful, 
They never say a 
word, 
But only blush and tremble, 
Which looks, I'm sure, absurd. 
While others they will kiss their love, 
Or know the reason why, 
But when my charmer's pa is near, 
These words are her reply— 
CHORUS. 
Not before pa, dear; not before pa, 
Say that you love me, but not before pa. 
Not before pa, not before pa ; 
I 
don't mind a 
kiss, love, but not before pa_ 
We strolled into the garden, 
And underneath the trees, 
We sat upon the lover's seat, 
To inhale the summer breeze. 
I 
told her how I 
loved her, 
Which caused a 
dreadful sigh, 
And when I 
said, " Oh, name the day—" 
These words were her reply— 
Not before pa, dear, etc.

M Y 
name is Simon Cloverseed, 
I 
deal in poultry, eggs, 
I've every kind of chickens 
That ever walked on legs ; 
Such cackling you have never heard, 
And the dickens all to pay, 
When the roosters all begin to crow 
At early dawn of day. 
CHORES. 
Such flapping, crowing, cackling, quackling, 
Feathers flying far and near, 
Mister Rooster flaps his wings (crow) 
When daylight does appear. 
The Guinea-hen talks politics— 
I 
tell you ' tis immense--
They have some funny arguments 
While sitting on the fence ; 
The bantam struts about and flirts 
With the pigeons in the cage, 
The turkey turns black in the face, 
And the gander's in a 
rage. 
Such flapping, crowing, etc. 
The ducks are tattling all the news 
About the shanghai's brother, 
The goose put on her spectacles 
And went and kissed her mother 
The chickens cackled loud with joy, 
One to the other said 
Miss Malay's proud as Lucifer, 
Her first egg she has laid. 
Such flapping, crowing, ate.

THE ITALIAN MOUNTAIN MAID. 
As sung with great success by JAMES GRAY. 
1.0 
THERE is a 
pretty little maiden that I 
ever dearly love, 
In Italy that bright and sunny land ; 
My life would be a 
pleasure, I 
would ask for nothing more, 
If she would share my heart and hand. 
For her father was a 
brigand on a 
lonely mountain pass, 
And with him on the mountain she does dwell. 
There is no titled lady in all Europe can surpass 
The dear Italian girl I 
love so well. 
CHORUS. 
Her father was a 
brigand on the mountain. 
She is as gentle as the daughter of an earl, 
And since she set me free, my heart will ever be 
A 
captive to the dear Italian girl. 
While roaming through the village 'neath the blue and 
sunny sky, 
A 
band of sturdy brigands bold and strong, 
Did capture me, and helpless, put a 
bandage on my eyes. 
A 
victim I 
was quickly led along. 
Five thousand pounds as ransom they said that I 
should 
pay, 
But that I 
was not rich enough to give, 
And only for the pleading of this little mountain maid 
They would not have permitted me to live. 
Her father was, etc. 
They put me in a 
dungeon where I 
thought that I 
should 
die, 
And while the brigand chief with all his band, 
Was plundering poor travelers, this lovely maid came 
nigh 
At gloomy night and by my side did stand. 
She tore my bin ls asunder, bade me rise and set me free, 
And from her father's coffers saved my gold, 
And while the tears of love and pity gladdened in her 
eyes, 
The ecret of our hearts was plainly told. 
Her father was.

It was always " Father says I

But she drives my frown off with a

Tril old-fashioned cottage, the place I 
loved so well, 
The spot where my mother and my father used to dwell, 
Oh! how often I 
have strolled thro' the fields of growing 
corn, 
Near the old-fashioned cottage, the place I 
was born. 
I 
remember the garden, the grove and the mill, 
And the little frame school house that stood on the HI, 
But with all its surroundings I 
loved none so well 
As the old-fashioned cottage where I 
once used to dwell. 
CHORUS. 
The old fashioned cottage, the place I 
was born, 
My home once so happy, has grown so forlorn, 
How I 
long to return to the home I 
love so well, 
The old-fashioned cottage where I 
once used to dwell. 
I 
long to return to the cottage once again, 
To think of it fills my heart with sorrow and with pain, 
Many years now have passed since I 
left my dear old 
home, 
To wander abroad through this wide world to roam. 
The spot has grown lonely that once was so bright, 
Where oft mother kissed her dear children good-night ; 
Oh ! how merry the birds sang their sweet songs of yore, 
As they perch'd on the maple near the old cottage door. 
The old-fashioned cottage, etc.

LONDON BRIDGE. 
Sung by the San Francisco Minstrels at their Opera House, P,roadway 
and Twenty-ninth Street. 
PROUD and lowly, beggar and lord, 
Over the bridge they go; 
Rags and velvet, fetter and sword, 
Poverty, pomp and woe. 
Laughing, weeping, hurrying ever, 
Hour by hour they crowd along, 
While, below, the mighty river 
Sings them all a 
mocking song. 
CHORUS. 
Hurry along, sorrow and song, 
All is vanity 'neath the sun ; 
Velvet and rags, so the world wags, 
Until the river no more shall run. 
Dainty, painted, powdered and gay, 
Rolleth my lady by ; 
Rags-and-tatters, over the way, 
Carries a 
heart as high. 
Flow'rs and dreams from country meadows 
Dust and din through city skies, 
Old men creeping with their shadows, 
Children with their sunny eyes— 
Hurry along, sorrow and song, etc. 
Storm and sunshine, peace and strife, 
Over the bridge they go ; 
Floating ou in the tide of life, 
Whither no man shall know. 
Who will miss them there to-morrow, 
Waifs that drift to the shade of sun ? 
Gone away with their songs and sorrow 
Only the river still flows on. 
Hurry along, sorrow and song, eta.

M AN the life boat! man the life boat! 
Help! or yon ship is lost; 
Man the life boat! man the life boat 
See how she's tempest-toss'd; 
No human power in such an hour 
The gallant bark can save; 
Her mainmast's gone, and hurrying on, 
She seeks a 
watery grave. 
Nan the life boat! man the life boat! 
See the dreadful signal flies; 
Ha! she has struck, and from the rock 
Despairing shouts arise; 
And one there stands and wrings his hanc1132 
Amidst the tempest wild, 
For on the beach he cannot reach 
He sees his wife and child. 
Life-saving ark! you doomed bark 
Immortal souls doth bear; 
Not (* ems, nor gold, nor wealth untold, 
But men, brave men are there! 
Oh, speed the life boat! speed the life Nal! 
Oh, God! their efforts crown I 
She dashes on—the ship is gone 
Full forty fathoms down. 
Ah, see! the crew are struggling now 
Amidst the billows' roar; 
They're in the boat! they're all afloat; 
Hurrah ! they've gained the shore; 
Bless the life boat! bless the life boat I 
Oh, thoult hear our prayer; 
Bless the life boat! bless the life boat I 
No longer we'll despair.

Von call me sweet and tender names, 
And softly smooth my tresses, 
And all the while my happy heart 
Beats time to your caresses. 
You love me in your tender way, 
I 
answer as you let me ; 
But ah! there comes another day, 
The day when you'll forget me, 
The day when you'll forget me. 
I 
know that eviy fleeting hour 
Is marked by thoughts I 
bring you, 
I 
know there dwells a 
subtle pow'r 
In the sweet songs I 
sing you. 
I 
do.not fear the darkest way, 
With those dear arms about me ; 
Ah! no, I 
only dread the day 
When you can live without me, 
When you can live without me. 
And still yon call me tender names, 
And softly smooth my tresses ; 
And still my happy answ'rincr heart 
Beats time to your caresses. 
Hush ! let me put that touch away, 
And clasp your hands above me; 
So while I 
ask to die that day, 
The day you will not love me, 
The day you will not love me. 
You need not check the thonnlits that rise 
With darkness wrapt about, them, 
For rr azin2 in your earnest eyes, 
My heart can almost doubt them. 
Yet hush my whispers as you may, 
Such chidings do not fret me ; 
Ah ! no, I 
only fear that day, 
The day when you'll forget me, 
The day when you'll forget me.

THE CREAM-COLORED HORSE. 
sung by HARRY Sm.swoon, 2,000 time. , 
with wonderful sueeeas. 
Aut.—" The Flying Trapeze." 
LISTEN to me, I've a 
sad talc of woe, 
A 
heart-rendino story that you must all know, 
Of a 
beautiful girl who had me for her beau ; 
To marry we both did agree, 
Our vows were most solemnly plighted, 
And I 
was so happy of course, 
Like a 
cabbage, my hopes she then blighted 
For a 
man on a 
cream-colored horse. 
CHORUS. 
lie rode round the ring with the greatest of ease, 
Shot through the hoop like a 
bullet through cheese, 
Stool on his head while his toe he would seize, 
And flip-flapped all over the ring. 
I 
took Liza Jane to the circus one night, 
To witness this daring equestrain flight ; 
She applauded so loudly, they all thought she was tight, 
Goodness ! how jealous I 
got 7 
Says I, " Liza Jane, do be quiet," 
Says she, " you are not my boss." 
Then she hollered for two quarts of pea- nuts 
For the man on the cream-colored plug. 
CIIORCS. 
Still the gawk rode around the ring with vehemence, 
Shot through the hoop like a 
bullet through cheese, 
Stood on his head while his toe he would seize, 
And flip-flapped all over the ring. 
He came out again with a 
flop and a 
whirl, 
When he came right fide up, he winked at my girl ; 
I 
had a 
great notion my cane then to twirl 
At this man in spangles and tights. 
She threw him a 
kiss back so quickly, 
For my feelings she had no respect ; 
And as he rode ' round the circle 
I 
wished that he might break his neck, 
SPOKEN.— But no didn't, for, 
cum:us. 
Ile rode round the ring, with utmost ease, 
Broke paper in the hoop, didn't touch knees, 
Stood on his bald bead, and neck- tie would seize, 
This man en the skim-milk mule. 
(1) 
THE CREAM-COLORED HORSE.—Continued. 
When we got home, we'd a 
terrible row, 
I 
called her false-hearted, she'd broken her vow, 
Says she, " quit my sight, t 
am done with you now, 
l'm enoaged to the star of the ring, 
I'll be called on the bills 
Senorita,' 
We will travel together of course, 
I'll do a 
flip-flop on his eye- brow 
As he rides on his cream- colored horse." 
CHORUS. 
Don't touch him, harm him not, the Epizootic he's got, 
The horse talks one way, the feller does not ; 
My song is now ended I'll go to my cot, 
Please excuse that eccentric old mule. 
THE CHESTNUT MAN. 
Written express] y 
for HARRY STAN WOOD by the late J. B. Mutzwy. 
On, listen to the doleful strain, 
That I'm a-going to sing you, 
About a 
tall Italian, and 
A 
gal that him did cling to ; 
He kept a 
stand upon Broadway, 
lot roasted chestnuts selling, 
And the stamps he took in every day, 
His pockets all were swelling. 
There was a 
maiden short and fat, 
With feelings soft and tender, 
And she fell in love with the chestnut man 
Because he was so slender, 
And he loved her with all his might, 
And called her " ducky honey," 
And sold her chestnuts every night, 
And wouldn't take any money. 
One day this maiden went for to go 
For to see her Italian lover, 
When she fell in front of an omnibus, 
And quickly was run over; 
When the chestnut man beheld the sight, 
And knew she was a 
corpus. 
He swallowed a 
quart of chestnuts down, 
And died of cholera morbus

those who weep and sigh; 
For to keep a 
good heart is a 
0-7-0 
brave man's part, So " nev - er 
say die," but " try." 
Some men will be poor, and be jolly too, 
While others with riches will pine; 
So which are the richer by far of the two 
Is not very hard to divine. 
Though " keep up your courage" is common, perhaps, 
'Tis not very far from the truth, 
For you can't make a 
man out of one of those chaps, 
Who lets his heart fail in his youth.— Cho. 
The bill we've to climb we must climb in our prime, 
Or else we shan't do it at all; 
For there's an old gentleman, called Father Time, 
Will give the go-by to us all ; 
So let us be happy, as long as we may, 
Until we have troubles, and then 
Let us meet them, and beat them, completely defek them, 
And conquer like resolute men.—Cho. 
Then never give way, nor put off for a 
day 
A 
task you once have begun; 
But work with a 
will, and don't leave it until 
You find that your object is won; 
For Providence watches your struggles, and knows 
Your heart has been brave in the fight; 
And you'll find from the autumn of life to the close 
Your days will be peaceful and bright.—.

FLIRTING ON THE LAWN. 
Words and music by FRANK DCNONT. Specially for HARRY PIERSON. 
Music published by BALMER and W EBER, St. Louis, Mo. 
FLIRTING in the twilight or beneath the starlight, 
While the strains of music come floating on the breeze; 
Wandering from the dancers, the polka or the lancers, 
And arm in arm with some one to stroll beneath the 
trees. 
That little rascal, Cupid, is not so blind or stupid 
But what he sees a 
target for his arrow and his bow
fJ le  ; 
moments fast are flying, and 'mid a 
little sighing 
We join the merry dancers that are gliding to and fro. 
CHORUS. 
While flirting on the lawn 
The moments quickly fly ; 
I 
smile behind my fan, 
And pretend that I 
am awful shy. 
He gently takes my hand, 
Which through me sends a 
thrill; 
And side by side we gently glide 
Through the lancers or quadrille. 
Flirting in the starlight aided by the moonlight, 
Listening to the whispers of one who hovers nigh ; 
Coquetting and pretending attention you are lending, 
Expect a 
declaration before you say good-bye. 
And in the rustic arbor, a 
safe and quiet harbor, 
Where vows are sealed with kisses that Cupid fails to 
hear ; 
Just one kiss not intended, our flirting then is ended, 
And pleasant recollections come in dreams that linger 
near.

BY THE BLUE ALSATIAN MOUNTAINS. 
Sung by DANIEL ULU.. 
Br the Blue Alsatian Mountains, 
Dwelt a 
maiden young and fair; 
By the careless flowing fountain, 
Were the ripples of her hair, 
Were the ripples of her hair. 
Angels bright, her eyes so winning, 
Angels bright her happy smile, 
And beneath the fountain spinning, 
You could hear her song the while— 
Ade, Ad.e, Acle, 
Such songs will pass away, 
Though the Blue Alsatian Mountains 
Seem to watch and wait always. 
CHORUS. 
Ade, Ade, 
Such songs will pass away ; 
Though the Blue Alsatian Motantains 
Seem to watch and wait always. 
By the Blue Alsatian Mountains, 
Came a 
stranger in the spring, 
And he lingered near the fountain, 
Just to hear the maiden sing, 
Just to hear the maiden sing, 
Just to whisper in the moonlight, 
Words the sweetest she had known. 
Just to charm away the hours, 
Till her heart was all his own. 
Ade, Ade, Ade, 
Such charms must pas away, 
Though the Blue Alsatian Mountains 
Seem to watch and wait always. 
Ade, Ade, Me, etc.

From France to Yankee land ; 
With serenades and banquets, too, 
Receptions every day ;

To see Miss Sarah play.

Her picture gallery is immense, 
At least so I 
have licsarcl ; 
A " peck " she eats at every gulp, 
Just like a

When chisling out a

Before she leaves us yet, 
We'll use her for a

On a

KISSING IN 11.131, MOONLIGHT. 
As sung by Miss GRACE GARLAND-
THERE are many pleasures spoken of 
By all, both young and old; 
There are fishing, boating parties, too, 
And picnics, I 
am told. 
But of all the pleasures there is none--
I'm sure you'll. say I'm right— 
As to place your arm round her you lova 
And kiss her in the moonlight. 
She's as handsome as a 
lily in the summer, 
(
Syin.7 
Fm proud to tell you all that I 
have won her. 
Of all the pleasmes spoken of— 
I'm sure you'll say I'm right— 
Is to place your arm round her you love, 
And kiss her in the moonlight. 
I 
met her first one summer's eve, 
I 
raised my hat and said : 
" 
I 
pray, dear miss, may I 
beg leave, 
To ask you if you'll wed ?" 
She raised her eyes, and sweetly smiled, 
It filled me with delight; 
So I 
placed my arm around her waist 
And kissed her in the moonlight, 
she's as handsome, etc.

The morning broke in blushes o'er me. 
As up in the sunny hill I 
strayed; 
A beauteous girl I 
saw before me. 
And thus I 
spoke the lovely maid: 
Sweet maid, and whither (lost thou rove! 
Thine eye is Cupid's piercing arrow. 
Thy name I 
prithee tell me, love ?' 
She said, ' They call me Rose of Ynrrow.' 
Be mine, dear maid, and fondly 
cheri3h 
Those blooming charms have won my heart, 
For sooner, dearest, would I 
Than any pang to thee impart.' 
She blush'd consent; the village peal 
Rang for our nuptials on the morrow, 
And bless'd contented do I 
feel, 
Pinsesi'd of her, sweet Rose of Yarrow.

THE ZOOLOGICAL DAMSEL, 
BANJO SOLO. 
Sung by EDWIN FRZNell, San Francisco Minstrels. 
THERE'S a 
gal lives in this city 
Of a 
very peculiar shape, 
She's something like a 
lizard, 
Or a 
big Brazilian ape; 
Her hair is full of feathers, 
And the color of a 
mole, 
And she carries in her slippers 
A 
couple of tons of coal. 
CHORUS. 
For she's so obtroprilom,, 
all the way from Indianapolis, 
Her nose, like a 
barber's pole, red, white and blue, 
And she could hold faster than a 
big mustard plaster. 
She'd skip o'er the gutters like a 
lame kangaroo, 
She was born way down in China, 
And you ought to see her laugh. 
Sherd shake the freckles off her lace, 
Stretch her neck like a 
giraffe ; 
She used to be a 
mummy, 
And her daddy was a 
miller ; 
She followed Barnum's circus, 
And was mashed on the gorilla. 
cuont 
s. 
Oh, she was so lanky, egotistical and cranky, 
She wore a 
big blanket to cover her breath ; 
All " Murphys" ' twould puzzle when beholding her 
guzzle ; 
She could talk any deaf and dumb feller to death. 
She had her picture taken 
On a 
slice of Switzer cheese, 
So each time that you beheld it 
You'd get a 
healthy breeze. 
She'd make a 
meal of garlic, 
And if you ever got a 
whiff 
You can bet your bottom dollar 
It would knock you cold and stiff. 
CHORUS. 
I 
repeat quite emphatic that she was a 
loon-a-tic— 
Her head it was hollow and light as a 
cork ; 
lie's a

No use was it kicking, for on she went licking, 
With spank ! spank ! spank! 
The thing she quite used to enjoy. 
Then it's over her knee, over her knee ; 
How my old Grandmother used to spank me, 
Over her knee, over her knee, 
When I

Over her knee, over her knee, 
Oft she would turn me, as if for a

Over her knee, over her knee, 
Turn me again and again; 
It was spank I

I'VE GOT A HEALTHY DARLING. 
Written for and sung by BILLY Bincli. 
I'VE got a 
healthy darling 
Who weighs three hundred pounds, 
She takes the cake at a 
fat clam-bake 
When she goes waltzing round; 
Her appetite is numerous, 
Her mouth is large, of course, 
She's death on clams and western hams, 
You bet she is the boss. 
She's witty, and pretty, 
As a 
wild-cat or giraffe, 
No never, hardly ever, 
Will you hear this darling laugh ; 
With freckled feet and voice so sweet 
As the solid rye and rock, 
She is the belle, her ears do swell 
A 
singing on our block.

Crying and weeping for her young m

Rise, Sally, rise, wipe your eyes out with your frock, 
The pet of all the neighbors a

No wonder she's so healthy, 
Because she's so well fed, 
She's the envy of our neighborhood 
With her great big bullfrog head ; 
She's handy with a 
boxing- glove.

With a 
base ball bat she killed a

How alarming, yet so charming, 
Does her hair flow to the breeze, 
In the polka or mazourka 
She can do with perfect ease. 
She's my sugar plum, my rum and gum, 
As solid as a 
rock ; 
My rootsey, chootsey, tootsey, wootsey, 
Singing on our block.

I'VE GOT A HEALTHY DARLING.—Concluciaa. 
At early morn when the birds would sing 
You'll find my Sally there, 
Dancing round the sweet rose bush 
With flowers in her hair ; 
The little chippies tootetoot, 
And bounce upon her ear, 
She joins them in their jolly songs 
When she is full of beer. 
She's a 
prancer, and a 
dancer, 
But on singing she'd go broke, 
She struck the key, it was high C, 
I 
thought she was going to choke. 
Her eyelids they've grown faded, 
Tossing freckles to the moon ; 
The neighborhood's gone crazy 
Listening to this dizzy coon.

SING ME THAT OLD SONG AGAIN. 
Sung by STANLEY GREY of the San Francisco Minstrels. 
SING me that old song again, love, 
Telling of memory dear, 
Fain would I 
hear it again, love, 
Whispering of hope that is near. 
Remember the night when we parted, 
You soothed all my sorrows to rest, 
And sang me that song so light-hearted--
Sing me that old song again. 
Sing me that old song again, love, 
The song that you sang long ago, 
Dearer each gentle refrain, love, 
Murmured sweetly and low. 
Dearly my heart loves to wander 
Backward down memory's lane, 
To the sweet time over yonder— 
Sing me that old song again.

OUR PATRICK IS AN ACTOR. 
By FRANK DUMONT. Sung by JAMES JOHNSON, and performed by 
JOHNSON 
POWERS. 
I 
HAVE raised a 
dozen children, quite proud of them am I, 
And some are influential, and hold positions high; 
Oh, I 
have lovely daughters, that can't be denied, 
They wear their silks and satins and in a 
carriage ride; 
There is Larry, Ted and Owney, with Terrence, Dan and 
Mike, 
All elegant, and scholars, you never saw the like ; 
But the youngest is our Patrick, he's worst of all, you 
see, 
For he's travelling with a 
circus, an actor man to be. 
CHOLI:S. 
Our Patrick is an actor, he wears the finest clothes, 
The ladies all admire him, no matter where he goes ; 
With diamonds on his shirt- front, a 
lump the size of that, 
It's folly to deny it, a 
dandy is our Pat. 
'When he's home upon a 
visit, the neighbors far and near, 
Extend an invitation to have cigars and beer ; 
I'll cook corned beef and cabbage to have a 
lovely meal, 
But Patsy dosen't touch it, so dainty does he feel ; 
But he'll eat ice etream mid peaches, blanc mange and 
custard pie, 
It's the style he learnt from actors, they're always living 
high ; 
But in spite of all his manners, a 
word for him we'll 
speak, 
He nia'er forgets his parents with money every week. 
Our Putriek is an auto; etc.

2 I 
went to the village school, 
And I 
proved so uncommon quick, 
That I 
galloped all through my geography, 
And I 
skipped my arithmetic. 
And my writing was " up and down," 
In a 
new and original style, 
And I 
jumped clean over the globes, I 
did. 
I 
was so volatile, 
I 
was so volatile, I 
was so volatile, 
E'en the Rule of Three was naught to me, 
I 
was so volatile. 
(

I AM SO VOLATILE. Concluded. 
3 
Then didn't I 
love the girls, 
And didn't the girls lova me: 
But 
never could keep t3 one you know, 
Through this infirmity, 
For its soon as Mary Ann 
Had inveigled me with her smile, 
I 
was " off" again to Betsy Jane, 
I 
was so volatile. 
I 
was so volatile, I 
was so volatile, 
I 
never could ctop the question to pop, 
I 
was so volatile. 
4 
Then I 
joined the Volunteers, 
And I 
raced the corps for a 
wager; 
But I 
couldn't keep still at the weekly drill, 
In spite of the Sergeant Major. 
And if ever I'm called to face 
The foe in rank and file. 
I 
very much tear I 
shan't be " near," 
I 
am so volatile, 
I 
am so volltile, I 
am so volatile, 
I 
fear I 
might be " out of sight," 
I 
am so volatile. 
5 I 
got more active still 
in the course of my career, 
For my Uncle Bill left me in his will 
Ten thousand pounds a 
year. 
That my poor relations grieve 
And despair, there's no denial, 
For I 
hear them cry, He never will die, 
He is so volatile. 
Yes, I 
am so volatile, oh, I 
am so volatile, 
They fume and fret, but nothing they'll get 
While I'm so volatile. 
(in an old man's voice.) 
6 
But now I'm getting old, " 
My hair is thin and grey; 
And my voice is so weak, I 
can hardly speak, 
And I've rheumn.tiz they say. 
But as for my blessed limbs 
They're just as juvenile. 
For they riggle and riot, and won't keep quiet, 
They are so volatile. 
I 
am so volatile. I 
am so volatile. 
Tho' I'm getting old, yet still I'm told, 
I'm just as volatile.

Of tobacco signs broke loose.

Published by permission of the author and owner of copyright. 
FOLD those little hands in prayer, 
Dimpled fingers softly pressed, 
O'er the pink lips murmuring low, 
Simple words divinely blessed, 
Fold those little hands so pure, 
As I 
bend o'er them to-night, 
Soft I 
whisper, spare, 0, Lord, 
Spare these hands to do the right. 
CHORUS. 
Fold those little hands in prayer, 
Fold those little hands in prayer, 
Dimpled fingers softly pressed, 
Simple words divinely blessed. 
Fold these little bands in prayer, 
Shadowed by thine own fair hair, 
By thy golden tresses brushed, 
Part they seem of thy pure prayer; 
May the mem'ry of this hour, 
Here beside thy mother's knee, 
Somewhere near the great white throne 
'Mong the many records be. 
Fold those little hands, etc. 
Fold those little hands in prayer, 
Intercede for me to-night, 
Baby's fingers oft have led me, 
Baby's footprints kept me right. 
Alt ! I 
have the faith to-night, 
As I 
feel thy warm hands pressed, 
That the dear Lord answers me, 
That these little hands are blessed. 
Fold those little bands, etc.

Gentle Genevieve ! 
All the world is hushed, love 
Birds and flow'rs asleep, 
Nature is reposing, love, 
Stars their vigils keep ; 
Venus from on high, love, 
Seems to burn more bright, 
Cheering up the starry sky 
Thro' the lonesome night. 
CHORUS. 
Genevieve, dear Genevieve ! 
My heart beats for you, for you, 
And it will be ever thus 
All my lifetime through. 
Hours seem but as moments, 
Moments are as hours, 
All of life's fierce torments 
Fly love's magic powers, 
In these arms so tender 
Earth seems melting fast, 
Heaven is opened to our view 
Ere our life be past. 
While upon my breast, love, 
Let your eyelids close, 
Creep unto my heart and rest 
In love's calm repose.

LAST NIGHT I WAS DREAMING. OF YOU. 
Sung by STANLEY GREY of the San Francisco Minstrels. 
LIST night I 
was dreaming of you, 
And bright happy moments gone by ; 
We trod the old paths that we knew 
Ere absence had caused us to sigh. 
Kind friends and companions were near, 
A 
merry and mirth-loving throng, 
With links of relationship dear, 
To bind us life's pathway along. 
I 
saw the sweet smile that you wore, 
As we gazed on the friends that we knew 
I 
heard the same voice as of yore, 
That told of a 
bosom so true. 
And long did that pleasure remain, 
And joyous each spirit did seem. 
Oh, vision, return once again 
Or quickly fulfilled be my dream. 
COME BACK TO THE OLD HOME AGAIN. 
Sung by STANLEY GREY of the San Francisco Minstrels. 
THE mother's heart was o'erladen with care, 
Her eyes oft filled with tears, 
And the father of trouble had borne his share 
For the son they'd not seen for years. 
In an angry mood he had gone away, 
And left them in grief and pain, 
Oh, would he could hear his parents say : 
Come back to the old home again. 
In vain his chamber is kept prepared, 
In vain they watch the door, 
In hope of news from hint who had dared 
To leave them forevermore. 
He lies dead in the bush 'neath the burning sky 
Of Australia's boundless plain, 
And never again will hear them cry, 
Come back to the old home again. 
CHORUS. 
Ye winds that blow o'er every sea, 
Bear with you our sorrowing strain, 
To our wandering boy, where e'er he may be, 
Come back to the old home again.

BRIGHT VISION OF MY DREAM. 
Sung by STANLEY GREY of the San Francisco Minstrels. 
W E 
meet once more, 
And still the same old smile illumes thy face ; 
Time bath not sought to mar thy form, 
But added grace to grace. 
Thine eye is still as purely bright, 
As softly ever beams ; 
I 
see thee as I 
saw thee then, 
Bright vision of my dreams. 
We meet once more; 
We meet to part as in the days of yore ; 
Thou tell'st me that my prayer is vain, 
And bid'st me love no more. 
Adieu ! adieu ! the pain is past I 
No longer pleasure gleams; 
I 
only find the vision bright 
Has vanished like my dreams. 
A FAREWELL SONG BEFORE WE PART. 
Sung by STANLEY GREY of the San Francisco Minstrels. 
ONE farewell song before we part, 
A 
requiem o'er the joys we've known 
I 
would have graven on my heart 
Thy latest look, thy fondest tone, 
To linger o'er by night and day, 
To cheer me on through every ill, 
And find by memory's aid I 
may 
Gaze on those eyes and hear thee still. 
Oh, 'twas a 
dream, that happy past, 
From which, alas 
we now awake 
To learn love's wreath we wove so fast, 
Has only bound us but to break ! 
Hope's blossoms withered, watched in vain, 
How prized, our bursting hearts can tell I 
Oh, let me hear thy voice again ; 
One parting song, and then, farewell

SOME day I'll wander back again 
To where the old home stands, 
Beneath the old tree down the lane, 
Afar in other lands. 
It's humble cot will shelter me 
From evAry care and pain, 
And life be sweet as sweet can be, 
When I 
am home again. 
CHORUS. 
I'll wander back, yes, back again, 
Where childhood's home may be, 
For memory in sweet refrain 
Still sings its praise to me. 
Some day I'll wander back again, 
To scenes so dear to me, 
Where life's sweet infancy's refrain 
Beside a 
mother's knee, 
To live once more the golden hour 
Of joyous, merry play ; 
No thorns but only sweetest flowers, 
There in life's merry way. 
I'll wauaer back, etc. 
Some day I'll wander back again, 
To hearts so kind and true, 
Whose gentle faces still remain 
In memory's cherished view. 
No more my wayward feet shall roam 
Life's troubled pathway o'er, 
But in the life and love of home 
rest me ever more. 
I'll wander back, etc.

THE SONGS MY MOTHER LOVED TO SING.

Arranged by W .

M ULLALY, San Francisco Minstrels. 
Music published by C. H. 
DITSON & CO., 711 Broadway, New York. 
Price 40 cents. 
THE songs my mother loved to sing, 
Could I 
but hear them once again ; 
To childhood's memories still they cling, 
They soothed ev'ry ache and pain ; 
Ali I 
how sweet they used to seem, 
How they made my heart rejoice; 
Years, long years, seem but a 
dream, 
Still I 
hear my mother's voice. 
CHORUS. 
Childhood's days to me so dear, 
Sweetest recollections cling ; 
How I 
often long to hear 
The songs my mother loved to sing. 
Those sweet and simple little songs, 
Songs I 
loved so well to hear ; 
How they'd heal my childish wrongs, 
How they'd seem to please and cheer. 
Songs in memory buried deep, 
Songs that oft put me to rest, 
Songs that closed my eyes in sleep, 
Lying on my mother's breast. 
Childhood's days, etc. 
Every simple little strain 
Calls to mind some happy scene, 
Brings up childhood's days again, 
Days to me yet fresh and green, 
Better far than glittering gold, 
Greater far than crown of king, 
Dearer far than wealth untold, 
The songs my mother loved to sing. 
Childhood's days, etc.

THE sweetest spot in this ' ere town, 
Where fragrant breezes rally, 
Old garbage, swill, and cholera— 
You'll find up in our alley. 
The street brigade ne'er ventures near, 
With their broom and shovel " ballet," 
The old soap- fat would knock you flat 
If you came up in our alley. 
CHORUS. 
The offal dock may scent the breeze, 
Or some old limburger jelly, 
An old bone yard or putrid lard 
Is sweet, compared with our alley. 
The Board of Health should surely come, 
And no longer dilly-dally, 
With chloride of lime and carbolic soap, 
To disinfect our alley. 
The smell would kill an old tom cat, 
And I'm sure he'd never rally, 
For in spite of " cops " they empty slops,— 
You can swim up in our alley. 
The offal dock may scent the breeze, etc.

THERE'S a 
girl of sweet sixteen, 
Who is all the world to me ; 
She's a 
little fairy queen, 
Just as dear as dear can be 1 
Oft I 
linger, long and late, 
By her little cottage gate; 
When I 
turn to go away, 
Oh ! how sweetly she will say,— 
CHORUS. 
Come again some other night, 
Come just after candlelight 1 
Now I 
really think you might 
Come again some other night 1 
In the moonlight, when we part, 
Oft I 
hold her to my heart, 
Breathing words of fondest love, 
'Neath the shining stars above. 
Roses, sleeping, never hear 
What I 
whisper in her ear ; 
Sweetly smiling, she does say, 
As I 
leave her side to stray,— 
Come again, etc. 
There's a 
nest among the flow'rs, 
Where, in others happy hours, 
We will ever fondly dwell, 
'Mid the bliss of wedlock's spelt 
Not a 
pain or thought of care 
Shall I 
find to grieve me there ; 
In those hours of life's sweet May, 
There will be no need to say,— 
Come again, etc. 
Words and music by VIRGINIA GABRIEL. 
Sung with great success by Timmy W. nor, with the San Francisco 
Minstrels. 
ONLY a 
face at the window, 
Only a 
face, nothing more, 
But the look in the eyes when they meet mine 
Still comes to me o'er and o'er I 
Only a 
word of greeting, 
Only a 
word, that was all, 
Yet all day in my heart it echoed, 
Like the sound of an angel's call. 
Only a 
smile of welcome, 
Only a 
smile as I 
passed, 
But that smile will still be remembered 
As long as my life shall last. 
Only a 
woman, you tell me, 
Only a 
woman to thee ; 
But there's naught that this wide world containeth 
Half so dear as this woman to me. 
BIRDIE HAS GONE WITH THE ANGELS. 
Words and music by JOHN CATLIN. 
Sang by HARRY W . 
ROE, with the San Francisco Minstrels. 
OH, Birdie has gone with the angels. 
They came at the close of the day, 
And whispered their beautiful stories 
To lure her from earthland away. 
Oh, Birdie has gone with the angels, 
And never again shall we hear 
The voice that awakened sweet music, 
Away in our solitude here. 
Oh, tearful and sad was our parting 
When shadows crept over the day, 
And closed her blue Eyes to our pickling, 
And darkened our desolate way ; 
But there was rejcicing in heaven, 
And wonderful sounds in the air, 
When Birdie went up with the angels, 
Away from our earthland so fair. 
YOU ASK ME TO FORGET YOU. 
Words by FRANK DUXONT. 
M USIC by W. S. M ULLALLT. 
Sung with great success by HARRY W . 
ROE, with the San Francisco 
Minstrels. 
I 
HAVE tried, but - I 
never can forget you, 
Your image ever haunts me night and day, 
And my heart for you is ever calling, 
Tho' we're parted, and its voice I 
must obey. 
Bid me hope, and return again, my darling, 
Again let Inc see thy smiling face, 
And the sad hours will then depart forever, 
When you take me to your sweet and fond embrace. 
You ask me to forget you, yes, forget you, 
But your image ever haunts me night and day; 
And my sad heart for you is ever calling, 
I 
listen to its pleadings and obey. 
I 
have tried, but I 
never can forget you, 
The memories of the past will come and go, 
Of the spot where we stroll'd so oft together, 
By the brookside where we whispered sweet and low. 
Oh ! between us the waves are rolling, loved one, 
My arms are extended out to you, 
Bid me come and I'll sail across the ocean 
Joyful as the drooping rose receiving dew. 
You ask me to forget you, etc.

IN 
the old Carlina State, 
Where the sweet magnolia blooms, 
And the penny darkey learns to hoe, 
There is one I 
long to see, 
She was always true to me, 
But I 
left her many, many years ago. 
'Mid the cotton and the corn 
There we both were bred and born, 
And together in the field we used to sow, 
But ' tis twenty years or more 
Since I 
left the cabin door, 
So I'm going back to see my darling Clo'. 
CHORUS. 
Darling Clo', darling Clo', 
Your sweet face I 
soon shall see, I 
know, 
Where the Southern sunny breeze 
Fans the old palmetto trees, 
I 
am going home to see my darling Clo'.

In that dear old sunny home 
Where the songsters always sing, 
And the mocking bird is singing all the day, 
She is waiting for her Joe, 
And I 
long to see my Clol, 
For like me I 
know her hair has turned to gray. 
The plantation is no more 
And the day of toil is o'er, 
For she's creeping very close to eighty-three, 
But she'll wait till I 
come back 
By the coon and possum track, 
For I 
have not seen her since we all were free. 
Darling Clo', etc. 
'Neath the genial Southern skies, 
Where the sweetest blossoms grow, 
And the music-loving darkeys all are gay, 
I 
am bound to see my Clo', 
And ' tis very sad to know 
That ere long they'll lay my poor old love away. 
When they place her 'neath the sod 
Upon which we often trod, 
Then this world will have no other charms for me, 
Then close by my Cloie's side 
This poor form will there abide, 
'Neath. the shadeless and the tall palmetto tree, 
Darling Clo', etc.

We've had a 
big Centennial fair 
To show our great increase ;

And really wish they'd go.

PERVERTED PROVERBS ; OR, TUPPERNY 
PHILOSOPHY. 
W ritten and composed by FRED ALBEIT. 
Sung nig_tly with great success by HAnny INALinc. 
M R. TUPPER has written a 
book, 
" 
Proverbial Philosophy " named, 
In its pages oft I 
look, 
For the sentences there are famed; 
There's a 
maxim for every day, 
And a 
motto for every man. 
If you wish to be happy and gay, 
The philosopher points the plan ; 
I 
have studied some of the proverbs wise, 
And trust I've not learnt them wrong, 
So list to the words of wisdom, 
And advice that flow through my song. 
Now where there's a 
way there's a 
will; 
That yen must Own is most true, 
A 
still head makes a 
wise tongue, 
You don't know what you can try tilI you do ; 
A 
mile is as good as a 
miss, 
Attend to these golden rules, 
And be careful between the grounds, 
Or else you'll fall on the stools ; 
Spare the child and spoil the rod 
If you would peace secure, 
And it's no use locking the horse up 
When you've lost the stable door. 
A 
feast is as good as enough, 
So says this wonderful book, 
Waste and you never will want, 
For too many broths spoil the cook; 
Every day has its dog, 
There's wisdom in every word, 
So hold up your man like a 
head, 
For the early worm catches the bird, 
A 
bird in the bush is worth two in the hand ; 
So all you covetous elves, 
You must never look after the pence, then 
The pounds will run after themselves.

PHILOSOPHY.—Concluded. 
Rolling MOSS gathers no .stone, 
in this marvelous work I 
have read, 
-Deep waters run very still, 
The least mended soonest said ; 
Half a 
none's better than loaf ; 
So let this be your plan, 
Never push the hill 
When its going down the man ; 
It's a 
very wise father knows his own child, 
And it ought to be written in gold 
That it's best to be off with the new love 
Before you get on with the oil 
When the wits in the wine's out, 
More speed less haste we learn, 
Once a 
child twice a 
man, 
So do a 
good can when you turn ; 
Those who live in stone houses 
Shouldn't throw glass, I'm Sure, 
When love comes in at the window, 
Poverty flies from the door; 
Late to bed and late to rise, 
It is the truth I 
tell, 
Will make you unhealthy, not wealthy, 
But make you look wretched ns well. 
nor wise, 
When the mice are away the cats play. 
So bear this well in mind, 
The proof of the eating is in 
The pudding you'll always find ; 
Go worse and you farther will fare, 
So no more in the book will I 
dip, 
But remember there's many a 
lip 
Betwixt the cup and the slip ; 
Brevity is the wit of soul, 
So I 
will finish my strain, 
And sing to you the rest of my proverbs 
Whenever you call aitin,

W HY did the angels take mamma away, 
Leaving me here in my sorrow to pine, 
Clouding my life that was once bright as May, 
Taking the love of my mother divine ? 
Weary I 
wander in search of a 
friend, 
Seeking a 
shelter to cover my head ; 
No one to help me my life to defend, 
Sometimes I 
almost could wish I 
were dead, 
CHORUS. 
Why did the angels take mamma away, 
Leaving me here in my sorrow to pine, 
Clouding my life that was once bright as May, 
Leaving me here, only sorrow is mine. 
Why did the angels take mamma away ? 
Were there not angels enough in the sky ? 
Why did they leave me alone here to stay, 
Helpless and needy and ready to die ? 
Why don't the angels eome take me there too ? 
Mother would open the beautiful gates, 
'Twas she that lov'd me so fondly and true, 
Now gone to heaven where happiness waits. 
Why did the angels, etc. 
Why did the angels take mamma away, 
Leaving her child here so helpless below ? 
Could they not spare her awhile here to stay ? 
Then naught but joy my poor heart would know. 
Will not the angels give place there for me ? 
Can I 
not go home with dear mother, too ? 
I 
am so weary and iong to be free ; 
Angels come take me to mother so true.

Beneath the stars, so pure ; 
I

While life and hopes endure; 
She gazed upon me with delight, 
And soft her acents fell, 
" 
Good- night, sweet love, don't tell papa! 
Remember, love, don't tell !" 
Oh, like the music, etc.

THE LITTLE PLOWER YOU GAVE WM. 
Words and music by MAcy. 
Sung with great success by HAnny W. ROE, with the San Francisco 
31instrels. 
I'VE been thinking, darling, thinking, of the days now 
past and gone, 
When I 
met you down beside the dear old mill, 
How you told me that you lov'd me and your heart was 
all my own. 
I'm thinking, darling, dreaming now of you, 
And in the shades of evening tears will fill mine eyes ; 
I'm lonely, lov'd one, all my journey through, 
For the little flower you gave me it is all I've left to 
prize, 
I'm thinking, darling, dreaming now of you. 
CHORUS. 
I've been thinking, darling, thinking, 
I've been thinking of thee fond and true ; 
And the little flower you gave me it is all I've left to 
prize, 
I'm thinking, darling, thinking, 
I 
am dreaming now of you. 
I've been thinking, darling, thinking, of our childhood's 
happy home, 
Where the weeping willows kiss'd the running stream, 
And the memories of the old home ever linger with me 
now,— 
rm thinking, darling, thinking now of you. 
Sweet angels guard my lov'd one ! guard her evermore ! 
We'll meet again beyond the jasper sea, 
For the memory of the past will come again a 
happy 
dream ; 
I 
think of you wherever I 
may go. 
I've been thinking, etc

BRIGHT tresses of golden hair twining 
O'er cheeks that are uimson and whiie, 
With blue eyes so roguishly shining, 
Like stars of the sweet summer night , 
The dimpled white fingers are straying'. 
To gently be clasped in our uwn, 
'While loving hearts ever are saying, 
Another sweet face in our home. 
CHORUS. 
Another sweet face in the cradle, 
One more in our sunny household, 
Whose coming we joyfully welcome— 
Another sweet face in the fold. 
From heaven a 
radiant blessing, 
Our little one to us was sent ; 
For kissing and tender caressing, 
A 
jewel from Paradise sent ; 
We call her our dear little fairy, 
None better 'neath heaven's blue dome ; 
Oh ! long in our fold may she tarry, 
This sweet little blossom of home. 
Another sweet face, etc. 
Yes, she is the daintiest lassie 
Of all that we cherish and love ; 
With laughter so gleeful and merry, 
And voice like the coo of a 
dove ; 
May life be a 
dreamland of pleasure 
Wherever her footsteps shall roam ; 
Our last and our best little treasure, 
This sweet little one of our home. 
Another sweet face, etc.

BEATMFUL JESSIE, THE LASSIE I LOVE. 
Sung by T. B. Drxos, San Francisco Minstrels. 
For sale at all the music stores. 
BEAUTIFUL Jessie, the lassie I 
love, 
She dwells in a 
cot on the banks of the Clyde, 
Her eyes are as bright as the stars far above, 
They beam into mine as I 
sit by her side ; 
She smiles as I 
tell her I 
love her so true, 
As if unbelieving what already she knew. 
Go where I 
will her smile will impart 
A 
gladness, although she has stolen my heart. 
CHORUS. 
Beautiful Jessie—beautiful Jessie— 
Her smile will a 
gladness ever impart. 
Beautiful Jessie, the lassie I 
love, 
I 
love her although she has stolen my heart. 
Beautiful Jessie, the lassie I 
love, 
I 
ne'er shall forget her wherever I 
go, 
We stray thro' the valleys, the meadows and dells, 
And tell o'er again the love tales that we know; 
Yet she tells me to wait, there is plenty of time, 
When I 
ask her to name the day when she'll be mine. 
The lassie I 
love I 
know loves me too. 
To beautiful Jessie I'll ever be true. 
Beautiful Jessie, etc. 
OVER 
GARDEN WALL. 
On , 
my love stood under the walnut tree, 
Over the garden wall. 
She whispered and said she'd be true to me, 
Over the garden wall. 
She'd beautiful eyes and beautiful hair, 
She was not very tall, so she stood on a &lab. 
And many a 
time I 
have kissed her there, 
Over the garden wall. 
CHORUS. 
Over the garden wall, 
The sweetest girl of all, 
There never was yet such eyes of jet, 
And you may bet I'll never forget 
The night our lips in kisses met, 
Over the garden wall. 
But her father stamp'!, and her father raved, 
Over the garden wall, 
And like an old madman he behaved, 
Over the garden wall. 
She made me a 
bouvet of roses red, 
But immediately I 
popped up my head, 
He gave me a 
bucket of water instead, 
Over the garden wall. 
Over the garden wall, etc. 
One day I 
jumped down on the other side, 
Over the garden wall, 
And she bravely promised to be my bride, 
Over the garden wall. 
But she screamed in fright, " Here's father, quick 
I 
have an impression he's bringing a 
stick 
But I 
brought the impression of half a 
brick 
Over the garden wall. 
Over the garden wall, etc. 
But where there's a 
will there's always a 
way, 
Over the garden wall. 
There's always a 
night as well as a 
day, 
Over the garden wall. 
We hadn't much money, but weddings are cheap, 
So while the old fellow was snoring asleep, 
With a 
lad and a 
ladder she managed to creep 
Over the garden wall. 
Over the garden wall, etc.

A 
SONG of joy rings in my heart, 
Since that bright happy day 
When light of purest love illumed 
My soul with lustrous ray ; 
Ah ! blissful words to say, 
In love's impassioned way, 
"My darling, by thy side, 
I 
could live and love alway," 
With beating heart I 
asked if augh 
Our bonds of love could sever ? 
For answer came, the whisper low, 
"My darling, yours, forever ! " 
CHORUS. 
" 
Thine, my love, forever, thine !" 
" 
Mine, sweet love, forever, mine ! 
Mine ! yes, forever," 
With beating heart I 
asked if aught 
Our vows of love could sever ? 
For answer came, the whisper low, 
"My darling, yours, forever ! " 
In love's own language oft we weave 
Our golden dreams of pleasure, 
By strength of loyal trust that lives 
Our future joy we measure : 
Each tender glance reveals 
The warmth the spirit feels, 
While merry chimes of joy 
Thro' the heart gayly peals 
Endearing words, so soft and shy, 
Of love that withers never. 
And dainty missives when apart, 
From " yours, my love, forever !" 
CHORUS. 
" 
Thine, my love, forever, thine ! " 
"Mine, sweet love, forever, mine ! 
Mina ! yes, forever."

And dainty missives when apart, 
From " yours, my love, forever ! "

Dilly Taylor was a 
brisk young fellow, 
Full of fun and full of glee, 
And his mind he did discover, 
To a 
lady fair and free. 
Four and twenty brisk young fellows, 
Dress'd they were in rich array ; 
Aml they took poor Billy Taylor, 
Whom they press'd and sent to sea. 
Then his true love follow'd after, 
tinder the name of Richard Carr; 
Her H Y 
hands were soon daubed over, 
With the tilthy pitch and tar. 
Now behold the first engagement, 
Boldly she fights anion ,' 
the rest, 
The wind it blew her jacket open, 
And discovered her milk- white breast. 
When the captain smilinf, viewed it, 
Said '
what wind has blown you here?' 
Sir, I 
come to seek my true love, 
Whom you press 'd and I 
love dear:" 
' 
If you've come to seek your true love, 
Tell me his name I 
pray;' 
Sir, his name is Billy Taylor, 
Whom you pressed and sent to sea.' 
'If his name is Billy Taylor, 
He is both cruel and severe : 
For rise up early in the morning, 
And you'd see hitn with his lady fair.' 
With that she rose up next mornin' 
Early by the break of day: 
And there she saw Billy Taylor, 
Dancing with his lauy gay. 
She then called for a 
sword and pistol, 
Which were broufdit at her command, 
And quickly shot bold Billy Taylor, 
Widi his true love in his hand. 
When the captain carne to know it, 
He much applauded what she had done; 
And immediately made her first lieutenant, 
Of the glorious Thunder Bomb.

THE SNOW WHITE BLOSSOMS.—CONOL17DED. 
'Mid smiling nature's varied charms, 
We'll roam and chat awhile ; 
Our hearts unswayed by anxious care, 
Our tongues untouched with guile; 
Secluded from the world around, 
From busy lane and street, 
tine bright blue sky above our heads, 
The daisies at our feet ;

Till evening fades away, 
Near the little snow-white blossoms: 
So beautiful are they. 
WILLIE, MV BRAVE. 
On the lonely sea-beat shore, 
A maiden fair was wePpinT,, 
Calling one who far away 
Beneath the wave was sleeping: 
Thus the sad, -unclianging strain 
Floated ever on the main-
61/w.—" Come o'er the billow, 
Ride on the wave: 
Come while the wind bloweth, 
Willie, my brave ! " 
He said his bark would soon return, 
And with a 
kiss they parted: 
But, when a 
year had passed away, 
She then grew weary-hearted. 
Oh! ' twas sad from day to day 
To hear the maiden's plaintive lay— 
Cho.—Come o'er the billow, dr,e. 
None who knew the maiden's grief, 
And saw her heart's devotion, 
Would tell her of the fragile bark. 
That sank beneath the ocean:

SHE DECEIvED HER JOHNNY. 
Words by 11.painr H UNTER. 
Composed by W ALTER REE.510X13 
Sung by G. II. M ACDERMOTT. 
I 
oxen loved a 
maiden—yes, dearly loved her, 
And to this young maiden I 
made an offer; 
She said she would have me and be my dear- wife, 
But I 
never was had so before in my life. 
CHORUS. 
For she smiled, and she kissed me, and made a 
great fuss:, 
And said, " My dear Johnny, there's none shall part us 
But when that conductor of her's came in view, 
She said, " Go to Putney, and I'll go to Kew !" 
No one in the world was so happy as us, 
'Till one day she took a 
ride on a 
Kew ' bus; 
And then the conductor she took for a 
beau, 
Oh ! 'who would have thought she'd conduct herself so 
When she smiled, etc. 
They married, but Bussy got tired of his fair, 
And said, my in-cu-bus you are, I 
declare; 
So one day he took this unfortunate gal, 
And dropped her down into the Surrey Canal. 
Though she smiled, etc. 
Now, when Bussy had done it, he wished he had not, 
And fainted and swooned away on the spot; 
And all that was found next morning, alas! 
Were his books and his number, lying dead on the grass. 
Though she smiled. etc.

A 
THE TIME WHEN WE WERE YOUNG. 
Written by BARRY BENNETT, 
Snug by HARM and CAREOLL„ 
DAR'S a 
pretty little spot down in Southern Tennemee, 
Whar de ivy blossoms twine around de door. 
And ever fresh and green in our memories it will be, 
Though we know we'll never see it any more. 
But we never can forget the old home we loved so well, 
And the many good old tunes that we have sung; 
And the tears they fill our eyes every time we try to tell 
Of the times we used to have when we were young. 
CH.ORUS. 
Oh, de tambo and de bones are forever laid away, 
And de fiddle and de banjo am unstrung; 
But we often heave a 
sigh for de happy days gone by, 
And de times we used to have when we were young, 
When de autumn days had come we would husk de yaller 
corn; 
In de fields we were a-singing all de day, 
For before dey made us free we had never cause to mourn, 
And around the old place everything was gay. 
And many, many times, when de work of day was o'er, 
With our melody de old plantation rung; 
And our hearts do often long for the happy days of yore, 
And times we used to have when we were young. 
Oh, de tambo, etc.

Tno' her robes are sombre gray, 
Tho' her pensive glances stray, 
Often to the dim beyond, 
And she be not gay or fond; 
When she murmurs happy rhymes, 
Conies the charm of other times, 
When she murmurs happy rhymes, 
Comes the charm of other times. 
Other times, 
Comes the charm of other times. 
Just as some fair statue glows 
'Nea,th its blushing wreath of rose, 
All the woman in her stirs ; 
Ah ! she had her worshippers. 
Thrilling tones and winsome ways, 
In the old and quiet days, 
Thrilling tones and winsome ways, 
In the old and quiet days. 
Quiet days, 
In the old and quiet days. 
Like the moonbeams on the river, 
How her soft lips pale and quiver, 
When they sing of days that hold 
Secrets love alone bath told, 
In the fair and sunny climes, 
In the dear old better times, 
In the far and sunny climes, 
In the dear old better times, 
Better times, 
In the dear old hotter times.

'We would gather round de fire 
Till de hweake it was done ; 
Den we all would eat our suppers, 
After dat we'd clear de kitchen, 
Dat's de only time we had to spare 
To have a

Uncle Gabe would take de fiddle down 
Dat hung upon de wall, 
While de silver moon was shining clear and bright; 
How de old folks would enjoy it, 
Dey would sit all night and listen 
As we sang in de evening by de moonlight,

In de evening by de moonlight, 
You could hear us darke„-s singing, 
In de evening by de moonlight 
You could hear de banjo ringing ; 
How de old folks would enjoy it. 
Dey would sit all night and listen 
As we sang in de evening by de moonlight, 
In de evening by de moonlight, 
When de watchdog would be sleeping 
In de corner by de fireplace, 
Beside de old armchair 
Where Aunt Chloe used to sit 
And tell de picaninnies stories, 
And de cabin would be filled 
With merry coons from far and near ; 
All dem happy times we used to have 
Will ne'er return again, 
Everyting was den so merry, gay and bright, 
And I 
never will forget it 
Just as long as I

How we sang in de evening by de moonlight.

THE PENNSYLVANIA QUAKERS. 
As performed by Jonxsox and POWERS. 
Is the State of Pennsylvania, 
Where the Shakers do reside, 
And the brothers and their sisters wear 
Their hats and bonnets wide, 
We've lived since we were children 
In a 
solemn homely style, 
And never were we boisterous, 
And seldom known to smile. 
CHORUS. 
Zacharlah, Jedediah, Flezekiah, 
Were family names of old ; 
Obadiah, Uriali, and Mariah, 
We often have been told, 
Came over with the pilgrims, 
In the steerage, down below, 
They all were a 
serious family, 
Precise and very slow. 
Not hilarious nor extravagant, 
You'll find this Quaker pair, 
For snickering out in meeting 
Is never practiced there; 
Our clothing is in keeping 
With the State we represent, 
We live in sweet simplicity, 
And never spend a 
cent.

IT'S HARD TO LOVE. 
As sung by CriiinvEs BACKUS, of the San Francisco Minstrels. 
I 
Lovnn a 
girl not long ago, 
her father drove a 
cart, 
But she's gone and left me all alone, 
And broken my poor heart. 
CHORUS. 
It's hard to love, hard to love, 
hard to change my mind, 
She's broken the heart of many another nig, 
And she's almost broken mine. 
I 
know I'll die, I'm sure I 
will, 
I 
feel it in my heart, 
And if she don't marry me. 
I 
will steal her father's mule and cart. 
It's hard to love, etc. 
Her front name was Susan Jane, 
She had a 
foot like a 
giraffe, 
And every time she went to walk, 
She made the darkeys laugh. 
It's hard to love, etc. 
If ever I 
do marry again, 
It won't be for love or riches, 
I'll marry a 
gal ' bout ten-foot- ten, 
So she can wear my—overcoat. 
LAST CHORUS. 
It's hard to love, bard to love, 
To me she was most dear, 
Fill up and bust, get up and dust, 
And walk off on your ear.

SCOTCH LASSIE, 
JEAN. 
As sung by Haverly's Mastodon Minstrels. 
The Music sent to any address, on receipt of 35 cents, by HENRY 
J. WEnatAx, 50 Chatham street, New York: 
Ix Scotland's fair land, o'er mountains and rills, 
That's where I 
roamed for many a 
day, 
In looking at the lads and lassies on the green, 
In the fair old land of Scotland far away. 
I 
have waited for her coming, but she has not come as 
yet ; 
The truth seems to dawn upon me plain ; 
They say she is false, but I 
still believe her true— 
She's my darling blue-eyed Scotch lassie, Jean. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! Jean, my bonnie Jean, come to your laddie once 
again ! 
They say you are false, but I 
still believe you mine, 
You are my bonnie blue-eyed Scotch lassie, Jean. 
She said she would meet me, but I've waited long in 
vain— 
In lands far away she does roam ; 
Her promise she will keep ; oh I 
break it not, my Jean ; 
We'll be happy in our bonnie little home. 
Oh I 
then let me not long wait, let me meet thee soon, my 
• 
Jean, 
And the heavens will smile on our love, 
And when life is dead, we will leave this earthly scene, 
And our hearts will dwell in joy and bliss above. 
Oh ! Jean, my bonnie Jean, etc.

But now I'm old and gray.

NEPTUNE, 
THE GOD OF THE SEA. 
Words by FRANK DUMONT. 
Music by W. S. 31uLLAL-r. 
As sung by the San Francisco Minstrels. 
OVER the rippling waters, sail o'er the watery way, 
Lightly the breeze is blowing, vessel and billows plity ; 
The heavens of blue above us, water on every side, 
The ocean is all around us—a 
restless, surging tide. 
Here on the deck I 
linger and gaze on yonder skies, 
The waves seem to frown in anger, higher and higher 
they rise ; 
Hail to the god of waters ! for Neptune holds his sway 
In his realms of snowy billows, may he speed us on our 
way. 
CHORUS. 
Hail to the god of ocean ! old Neptune holds his sway 
In the realms of snowy billows that speed him on his 
way. 
Here on the deck I 
linger and gaze on yonder skies, 
While the billows frown in anger, higher and higher rise. 
Over the angry waters, over the sullen tide, 
List to the tempest howling over the ocean wide ; 
The darkness of night's around us, hark to the wailing 
sounds ! 
The winds thro' the sails are shrieking ! the vessel on-
ward bounds ; 
The forked and vivid lightning now follows every crash ! 
The voice of old Neptune is thunder, his eyes the light-
ning's flash. 
Hail to the god of ocean ! for Neptune holds his sway ; 
He will ride on the snowy billows when the storm has 
passed away. 
Hail to the god of ocean ! etc.

THE RESPONSE 
I 
have put the children to bed. harry— 
Rose and Willie and Maud— 
They have sung their hymns together, 
And whispered their prayer to God. 
Then Rose said, gently smiling, 
Come Willie and Maud, now say. 
God bless the dear, sweet father— 
Father so far away !" 
And shell a 
glad trust arose. Harry, 
in this sad heart of mine, 
For I 
felt that God would keep you 
Safe in his heart divine. 
And I 
kissed their pure, young foreheads, 
And said. 
He is over all! 
lie counteth the hairs of your heads, darlings, 
And noteth the sparrow's fall." 
Then I 
sung them to their sleep, harry, 
With hymns all trust and love. 
And I 
know that God was listening 
From This gracious throne above. 
And since that calm, sweet evening, 
I 
have felt so happy. dear ! 
And so have the children. Harry ; 
They seem to know no fear. 
They talk of your coming home, harry, 
As something sure to be ; 
I

Nor care to cheek their glee. 
For ohm! ' tis a 
cause so noble, 
And you so brave and true : 
And God protects his own. Harry! 
And surely will watch o'er you. 
So keep up a

We'll welcome you, safe and happy, 
Back to the dear home- nest. 
And Maud and Rose and Willie

THE YACHTSMAN. 
Music by J. E.ExtN.oToN FAIRLAME. 
sung by HARRY W . 
ROE of the San Francisco Minstrel& 
THEN distant leave the shore behind 
And spread the canvas wide, 
As fleet as birds before the wind 
We on our course shall glide. 
The sparkling brine 
Will cheer like wine, 
As o'er the blue we take our way. 
Over the sea to distant lands 
Our good yacht gayly speeds away, 
While heart and soul cannot control 
The new-found freedom felt to-day. 
Then bowl along right merrily, 
And bow before the blast, 
The sailor sings so cheerily 
As upward to the mast 
He goes, no fear 
Can daunt his fearless heart so true ; 
The ocean is his home, 
He loves to roam. 
Over the sea to distant lands 
Our good yacht gayly speeds away, 
While heart and soul cannot control 
The new-found freedom felt to-day.

" 
RING down the curtain !" the last act is o'er, 
The sad play of life is now past ; 
One more is nearing the dark, unknown shore, 
The moments are waning so fast! 
Far from the burden, the tumult and strife, 
While tears dimni'd each sorrowing eye; 
Sad was the whisper, the last words of life : 
" 
It's no use, God bless you ! Good.- bye !" 
CHORUS. 
" 
Ring down the curtain ! " Oh, sweet be the sleep 
That waits the kind-hearted on high! 
Fondly this mem'ry the heart now will keep ; 
"It's no use, God bless you, God bless you, 
good-bye 1" 
" 
Ring down the curtain !" no more shall we see 
The sweet smile so kindly and true; 
Dim are the eyes that once sparkled with glee, 
The hopes that were bright as the dew! 
Dear is the vision that mem'ry recalls, 
To hearts that forever must sigh ; 
Sad is the echo that lingering falls : 
" 
It's no use, God bless you 1 
Good-bye ! "

APPETITE MAUD. 
Words and Music by Wm. CA.RROLL. 
W HILE walking with my girl one evening, 
The snow was falling thick and fast; 
She told me that she felt like eating, 
And her jaw fell like a 
flag half-mast. 
I 
knew her appetite was powerful, 
A 
great deal larger than her feet, 
And not having any sugar with me, 
I 
felt like a 
double-breasted beat. 
CHORUS. 
For she'd eat a 
coal cart without pepper, 
She'd eat an attic full of dust ; 
She'd eat porous plasters by the dozen, 
And chest-protectors till she'd burst. 
We walked along for a 
block or two, 
c 
When I 
thought my Maud. was going to faint; 
I 
grabbed her by the back of the neck, 
When some one yelled out " Look out for paint I" 
I 
gently laid her in the gutter, 
And fanned her brow with a 
paving stone; 
I 
hired a 
push- cart from a 
rag man, 
And sung " Baby mine" while I 
wheeled her home. 
APPETITE MAUD.—Concluded. 
CHORUS. 
For she'd eat an acre of cucumbers, 
With mackerel fins and herring backs; 
She'd eat a 
cornfield full of cabbage, 
And finish up on carpet tacks. 
I 
went down to her house next evening, 
To inquire how she had been that day, 
She received me with a 
red-hot poker, 
And smashed me with a 
bale of hay. 
I 
asked her if she would forgive me, 
She answered as she grabbed a 
chair, 
I 
made a 
jump, but she was too quick, 
And I 
left a 
tooth and a 
lock of hair. 
CHORUS. 
So farewell, lantern-jawed mummy, 
I'll remember you, for sure, 
All the harm I 
ever wish you, 
Is when you die they'll drop you in a 
sewer.

A 
LITTLE place within thy heart, 
Oh ! sacred keep fer me, 
When we must linger far apart, 
And days must weary be ; 
Though other smiles and joys are thine, 
One thought of sad regret, 
I'd have thee evermore enshrine 
Of days when first we met ! 
Though fate may hold us far apart, 
And days may lonely be, 
A 
little place within thy heart, 
' 
Oh ! dearest, keep for me. 
A 
little place within thy heart, 
Oh ! keep until the last ! 
When weary, sad and lone thou art, 
And I 
from the earth have past ! 
One simple little flower, oh ! keep, 
To tell of happy days ; 
When ' neath the dewy grass I 
sleep, 
Oh ! speak one word of praise ! 
Though here no more, meet or part, 
Though life may lonely be, 
A 
little place within thy heart, 
Oh ! dearest, keep for me !

W HAT should make thee sad, my darling? 
Why' those pearly tears I

Have I

Have I

By the sta.

By their wondrous mystery, 
By this heart that beats within me, 
Still I 
love thee, love but thee.

Why thosb pearly tears I

Have I

O'er the bosom of thc ocean 
Shall the sea- bird e_ease to rove, 
Sun and stars shall cease their motion, 
Winds and clouds forget to move, 
E'er my love for thee shall falter, 
Or my faith forgotten be; 
All things else on eartn may alter, 
Still I 
love thee, love but thee. 
Whit should mak* thee sad, etc. 
Joyfully when first I 
found thee, 
Bowed my soul at love's behest ; 
Now when sorrows gather round me, 
Thou alone can'st make me blest 
Be my heart thy throne forever, 
Let all tears forgotten be, 
Weal or woe estrange us never, 
till I 
love thee, love but thee.

THE rose so red, the violet blue, 
Is sang of every day ; 
Forget-me-nots, the pansies, too, 
Are sang in every lay. 
But I've got one to please you all, 
It's new to you, I 
greet, 
'Tis called the Rose Patch- on-la, 
With its fragrance rare and sweet. 
CI-JOEL'S. 
Its color so bright, ' tis wavy and light, 
Always bowing meekly to the ground ; 
Its fragrance so rare, without thoughts of care, 
The Patch- on-la sweet for me. (Dance.) 
When early morn the night does greet, 
And daylight claims its sway ; 
'Tis then this little flower bright, 
Its jewels does display. 
Its brilliant hues and colors light, 
And wondrous beauty shows, 
'Midst earth's fair blossom Patch-ou-la, 
'Es the loveliest flower that grows, 
Its color so bright, etc. 
Sung by Blur W EST. 
Just listen to my lay, 
I 
know its going to please you; 
The song I'm going to sing. 
Is just the style to snit you. 
I 
had a 
dream and it did seem 
To be most awful queer ; 
For the Birds and Leasts they hada Fair, 
And I 
was Overseer. 
It was the Anima's' Fair, 
The Birds and Beasts were there; 
The gay baboon by the light of the moon 
He combed his auburn hair. 
The monkey he got drunk, 
Fell down on the elephant's trunk, 
The elephant sneezed, 
Fell on his knees, 
And how was that for the monk. 
The jay- bird played the flute, 
The musk- rat played the fiddle; 
The tiger-cat anti the mouse 
Danced up and down the middle. 
The elephant hugged the 1)1111-dog's neck, 
And the bear got up hue dander: 
The camel smashed the fox in the eyes, 
And bit off the ear of the 14ander. 
The bear he wa ted a 
drink, 
The crocodile lie did wink, 
They tossed a 
cent, 
The goose was sell t, 
But she got full with the mink ; 
The mosquito said to the flea 
This is no place for Inc ; 
The mosquito stung the lion's nose, 
Alia the wild-cat swallowed tile bee. 
The squirrel he called for bash, 
And fish- balls made of mud ; 
The cow she chewed tub cco, 
'I hen threw away her cud. 
Fresh green- peas from cinnamon trees, 
Gras-smps and wine was called ; 
The piLrs did cry, '• root hog o, 
And the cats in chorus mauled. 
But it sti.m began to ain, 
The Fair to an end it came; 
The monkey hissed. 
The donkey's wife, 
The mole he laughed quite plain ; 
The bull-dog lost his tail. 
The grasshopper he turned pale, 
The donkoy stabbed the mule with his ear, 
And hung himself to a 
nail. 
OH! Win WAS I 
SO SOON FORGOTTEN.

On ! why was I 
so soon forgotten, 
When to me such fond vows were made, 
Like the rays of sunlight she did promise 
On me to cast love's only shade ; 
But, alas ! my sorrowed heart is weeping, 
In this dreary world I'm left alone, 
She who promised that she'd ne'er forget me, 
Now claims another as her own, 
cnonus. 
,Oh ! why was I 
so soon forgotten, 
In anguish my poor heart aches with pain. 
Tho' she's gone from me, and now's another's, 
Still in heaven, mine she'll be again. 
Since childhood it has been my fortune, 
To always find my fondest hopes decay ; 
I 
ne'er met with any hope or treasure, 
But it would fade and pass away. 
Tho' twas hard to hear that she had wronged me, 
Still my lot in life I 
firmly knew, 
When ' twos told me I 
had been forgotten, 
I 
cried, she too, has been untrue. 
! 
why was I 
so soon forgotten, etc. 
WATCHING.

Word. by GEORGE COOPER. 
Music by H ARRISON M ILLARD. 
The music of this song ls published by Wm. A. POND dr CO , 547 Broadway, 
New York. Price 50 cents. 
On, weeping eyes that watch in vain 
Thro' weary hours of care! 
Oh, hearts that lona to meet again, 
Yet pine in (lark despair ! 
Alone I 
alone ! the stars look down 
In pity from above ; 
The night bird calls, the teardrop falls, 
Watching for those we love, 
Watchina for those we love I 
Gay plumes were dancing in the sun, 
The onward march had just begun ; 
"Farewell ! farewell ! my darling one, 
Farewell ! farewell ! my darling one, 
I 
11 soon come back, 
PH soon conic back to thee !" 
" 
Oh, keep this little rose," she said, 
" 
Oh, keep this little rose, " she said, 
And on his shoulder bow'd her hear.I, 
And on his shoulder bow'd her head : 
" 
What tho' its bloom will soon be fled I 
Oh, still remember me, 
Oh, still, oh, still remember me !" 
" 
My heart, my heart will e'er be true !" 
The gallant ranks were lost to view ; 
But still a 
white hand wav'd adieu, 
Upon that daisied lea, 
Upon that daisied lea. 
The moon streams on her window pane ; 
A 
soldier lies at rest 
Upon the far off' battle plain, 
A 
red rose on his breast ! 
T;te night winds si(di " Alone! alone !" 
The stars watch from above, 
Oh, hearts that beak, so weary grown, 
watching for those they love, 
For those they love, for those they love, 
Watching alone, watching alone, 
For those they love, alone, 
For those they love, for those they love !

I

I

I

I

How old brudder Peter did ring dat bell.

ALL GETTING MARRIED. 
As sang by TONY PASTOR. 
BEHOLD in this mortal a 
poor single man, 
Who wanders about all the day, 
No one in this world cares a 
jot about me 
As long as my lodgings I 
pay ; 
I 
aways was shy, and often would cry 
If any young girl winked at me; 
But, to tell you the truth, all the friends of my youth, 
They are all getting married but me. 
CHORUS. 
The birdies that fly, the pigs in the sty, 
The fishes that swim in the sea, 
The mice and rats, the dogs and the cats, 
They are all getting married but me. 
Oh, it makes me feel awful when I 
look around, 
And think of the days that are gone; 
I 
see my old " pals" walking out with their girls, 
While here I 
must wander alone; 
I 
often have a 
doubt and want to find out 
Whatever the matter can be ; 
The haddocks and whales, the frogs and the snails, 
They are all getting married but me. 
The birdies that fly, etc. 
There is only one thing in this world I 
can do, 
That is, for to cross the wide sea, 
Join Brigham Young, and a 
Mormon become, 
Then, perhaps, much more happy I'll be ; 
But it seems very queer that there is no girl now here, 
I 
fancy they could take to me; 
The sparrows and wrens, the cocks and the he, 
They are all getting married but me. 
The birdies that fly, etc.

IN 
the bright annals of the stage, 
Some great men we have lost, 
Who new have left the footlights' glare, 
To another land have crossed. 
Edwin Adams we shall see no more, 
Prom us he's passed away, 
Nor Burton, with his merry laugh, 
The drunken Toodles play. 
We'll smile no more at G. L. For, 
And gone from us afar, 
Is the one we loved above them all, 
Old Uncle Ben DeBar. 
E. L. Davenport has passed away, 
Yet his fame I 
will recall; 
Such men will never be forgot, 
And I 
wish good luck to all. 
Where am the merry minstrels gone, 
Who in the days past by, 
Did make you laugh throughout the night, 
When filled with mirth and joy ?

And Unswortli in his speech,

MEMOIRS OF THE STAGE.—Concluded 
Where is the man so great and tall, 
To every one a 
friend, Billy Manning ? 
Greatest of them all, 
Alas, he met his end. 
Where is Dan Bayant, whom you.. 
loved ? 
On him no more you'll call. 
Such men will never be forgot, 
And I 
wish good luck to all. 
Matilda Heron, bright Camille, 
Has crossed the unknown shore, 
And Lucille Western, once our pride. 
Has gone forever more. 
Great Charlotte Cushman disappeared, 
And we can mourn our loss. 
Sweet Laura Keene has pass'd away, 
The dark dread gulf has cross'd. 
Such women in ray early days, 
I 
loved to see them play. 
And watched them tread the mimic stage, 
In hours now passed away. 
I 
thought the angels were so bright. 
Till they from life did fnl/ ; 
They yet in memory hold a 
place, 
And I 
wish good luck to all.

sailed away at break of day, 
The skies were blue and fair, 
He kissed his bonnie hand to me, 
With heart as light as air ; 
" 
Hark ye," he cried, " go watch the tide, 
As it cometh up to Lynn, 
For, foul or fair, I 
will be there 
When the flowing tide comes in I" 
I 
wateh'd the clouds that came in crowds. 
Like flocks of evil birds, 
My heart sank low with bitter woe, 
Rememb'ring Donald's words; 
" 
Oh, God !" I 
cried, and none beside 
• 
Knew the grief my heart within, 
" 
Oh ! give me back my bonnie lad, 
None else my love can win 
Oh! give me back my bonnie lad, 
When the flowing tide comes in." 
S,..zng with immense success by M ISS GEORGIE M ELNOTTE, the 
Queen of Serio-Comique. 
FARE thee well, for once I 
loved you, 
Even more than tongue can tell, 
Little did I 
think you'd leave me, 
NOW I 
bid you a 
farewell. 
You have wrecked the heart I 
cherished, 
You have doomed me day by day, 
You are false, but I'll forgive you, 
But forget you I 
never may. 
(Repeat last two lines.) 
When I 
saw your eyes in virtue, 
I 
could scarce believe my own, 
When I 
heard your voice in anger, 
It was death to every tone. 
They have told you some false stories, 
And you believed them all they say, 
You are false, but I'll forgive you, 
But forget you I 
never may. 
(Repeat last two lines.) 
One more word and all is over, 
'Why are you unkind to me ? 
Tell me why you do not love me, 
Turn aside how can it be ? 
No word, not one word of pleasure, 
You believe them all they say, 
"You are false, but I'll forgive you, 
But forget you I 
never may.

MUST LEAVE YOU. 
Sung with great success by. 
the late EDDIE NOUWOOD. 
On, I 
love- a 
dbanning girl, 
And to her I

Say or do anything that's wrong;

When she names the happy day 
Of course it will end all my cares and strife.

THE shoemaker sat amid wax and leather, 
With lapstone over his knee ! 
Where, snug in his shop, he defied all weather; 
Drawing his quarters and sole together, 
A happy old man was he. 
This happy old man was so wise and knowing, 
The worth of his time be knew ; 
He bristled his ends, and he kept them going, 
And felt to each moment a 
stitch was owing 
Until he got round the shoe. 
Of every deed that his wax was sealing 
The closing was firm and fast; 
The prick of his awl never caused a 
feeling 
Of pain to the toe, and his skill in healing 
Was perfect and true to the last. 
Whenever you gave him a 
foot to measure, 
With gentle and skillful hand 
He took his proportions with looks of pleasure, 
As if you were giving the costliest treasure, 
Or dubbing him lord of the land< 
And many a 
one did he save from getting 
A 
fever, a 
cold, or cough, 
For many a 
foot did he save from wetting, 
When, whether in water or snow ' twas setting, 
His shoeing would keep them off. 
When he had done with his making and mending, 
With hope and a 
peaceful breast, 
Resigning his awl, and his thread, was ending, 
He passed from his bench, to the grave descending, 
As high as a 
king to rest.

GOOD OLD SOUTHERN HOME. 
Sung by AL. PAGE. 
Not many years ago, 
When I 
use to rake and hoe 
On the Louisiana bottom, all the day ; 
But since I've been set free, 
Not much pleasure do I

But at last those good old days have passed away. 
But I 
am getting old and gray, 
And I 
soon must pass away. 
My good old massa beckons me to come. 
If you hear those voices ringing 
I'm waiting for you now, so I 
must go leave my good old 
southern home. 
CHORUS.

On ! the moon is shining down on our snowy canvas town, 
And the rivulet runs laughing to the sea, love ; 
But my heart is sad and low, for I 
think of long ago, 
When the rivulet but laugh:a for thee and me, love. 
'Twits the autumn of the year, and the leaf was red and 
sear, 
But our hopes were bright as spring-time's budding bough,

And the rivulet runs laughing to the sea, love ; 
But my heart is sad and low, for I

Dost thou ever think of me, by that river of the sea, 
When the .breath of hawthorn blossoms 
the plain, 
love ? 
When the glowworm lit the shade, whilst our vows of love 
were made, 
To be broken ere the blossoms came again, love. 
They tell me thou art gay, in thy palace far away, 
Where another gains the smiles that were once mine, 
love ; 
And my heart is sad and low, for I 
think of long ago, 
And the folly of this heart that once was mine, love. 
REFRAIN. 
Whilst the moon is shining down on our snowy canvas 
town, 
And the rivulet runs laughing to the sea, love ; 
Here I cast upon the stream all remembrance of the 
dream, 
That is laughing water now to thee and me, love.

Ile squeezed my baud in a

And went on anyhow : 
Be praised my toilet, thought it neat, 
As we walked to and fro ; 
The things he said were very sweet; 
But then his waltzing, oh!

The waltzing done, he said " my love, 
This balcony is nice," 
And then, oh ! foolish, fluttering dove, 
I 
let him kiss me twice ; 
And though I 
said, " Please let me go," 
Resistance was in vain, 
us lips were very near, and so 
kissed him back again!

With all the cheek in life— 
The lady then he introduced 
As Mrs. Brown, his wife.

YOUTH has gone forever, my darling,

And the days are fast approaching, 
When our dearest joy is rest. 
We have tasted many pleasures, 
And their fragrance lingers yet, 
But I

Snowy strands among the jet.

You have worn when life was brightest, 
Roses in your dark hair set ; 
Wear with equal grace, my darling, 
Snowy strands among the jet. 
You have worn when life was brightest, 
Roses in your dark hair set ; 
Wear with equal grace, my darling, 
Snowy strands among the jet. 
We have lived, and life was pleasant, 
We have laughed, our mirth was gay ; 
We have sung and danced and flirted, 
As our youth fled fast away. 
But the dance must end, my darling, 
Let it pass without regret ; 
Time has placed his hand upon us, 
Snowy strands among the jet. 
You have worn, etc. 
Let us not for joys departed, 
Grieve our souls with mournful thought ; 
Truer pleasures are before us, 
If with patient faith they're sought. 
Let us win a 
happy future, 
Nor for past enjoyment fret ; 
Let us wear a 
crown of honor, 
Snowy strands among the jet. 
You have worn, etc,

HOP ALONG, PETER. 
Comic Song by FRANK DUMONT. Sung by Wm. COUISTRIGPIT. 
OLD Uncle Peter got full last night, 
Looking out the window, saw a 
sight ; 
This is the story he told me 
All about the animals he did see ; 
Skunk on de wall, blowin' his nose, 
Toads in de grass, wore soldier's new clothes ; 
Ducks and gander, and de ole gray nag, 
Playing on de pianer, " Rally roun' de Flag." 
CHORUS. 
Hop along, Peter, hop along, hop along, 
Hop along, Peter, whar you gwine, 
Hop along, Peter, hop along, hop along, 
Owl in de tree, winking and blinking, 
Cats in de pantry, catching mice ; 
Bugs in de attic, playing poker, 
Spider on a 
cobweb, throwin' dice 
Pigs rehearsing in de swill- tub, 
Ducks in de river, tellin' lies ; 
Bull-frog on de stump, grabbing ' skeeters, 
Bald-headed June bug coaxing flies. 
Hop along, Peter, ets 
Grasshopper in de barn, singing soprano, 
Big bull- frog singing bass ; 
Elephant on de wall, out serenadin', 
Little brown weasel wid a 
wart on his face ; 
Coon up a 
tree, sayin' his prayers, 
Nigger eating railroad iron, up-stairs; 
Sally hi de garden, lifting peas, 
Come and kiss me, if you please. 
Hop along, Peter, ete.

On, mamma, come sing me to sleep, 
The night is so dreary and long; 
I 
cannot in slumber repose 
Until I 
have heard your sweet song ; 
The wind whistles loud through the tree; 
The thunder is painful to hear, 
And when in the heavens it rolls 
I 
tremble, dear mamma, with fear. 
Oh, mamma, come sing me to sleep, 
The night is so dreary and long; 
I 
cannot in slumber repose 
Until I 
have heard your sweet song. 
Oh, mamma, come sing me to sleep, 
Or tell me that story I 
love, 
Where Benny, you say, is at rest 
:With angels in heaven above; 
The rain beats so hard ' gainst the pane, 
I 
cannot, I 
fear, close my eyes, 
And then the quick flash of the light 
Illumines the thick cloudy skies. 
Oh, manmt
I, etc. 
Oh, mamma, come sing me to sleep, 
Come sit by my side just awhile ; 
There's comfort and faith in your voice, 
There's pleasure and love in your smile; 
And when I 
awake in the morn, 
To greet you, as often before, 
Your arms will be open for me, 
I'll look for your kiss at the docr. 
Oh, mamma, etc.

W HERE the water lilies grow, 
And the zephyrs gently blow, 
Where the waters softly flow, 
Meet me, darling Annie! 
When the whippoorwill cloth call, 
And the dewdrops softly fall, 
While the moon shines over all, 
Kiss me, darling Annie! 
CHORUS. 
When the flowers fall asleep, 
And the moon shines o'er the deep, 
Tell me I 
your heart may keep, 
Then, my darling Annie! 
Harken to the turtle dove, 
Cooing from his nest above, 
Lisening to the tale of love, 
Whisper'd unto Annie 
How he envies me the bliss, 
Pressing such a 
form as this, 
How he wishes he might kiss 
Your sweet lips, my Annie! 
When the flowers, etc. 
While the little stars do shine, 
Place your snowy hand in mine, 
Whisper softly, " I'll be thine," 
Now, my darling Annie! 
From the clouds the moonbeams break, 
Show'ring silver o'er the lake, 
List'ning to the vows I 
take, 
From you, darling Annie! 
When the flowers, etc. 
Though sorrow's cloud is o'er me now, 
And I 
must soon depart, 
Perhaps for years in foreign lands, 
To roam with aching heart ; 
We still may hope that happier days 
In store for us remain, 
And though we part in anguish now 
We yet may meet again. 
Ah w(11 I 
know when far away 
You oft will think of me, 
The truth is in thy gentle voice 
And breathes I 
live for thee 
Then taithful still in every clime 
We'll wake the cheering strain, 
Tho' distance may divide us now, 
We yet may meet again. 
Prom the white blossom'd sloe, 
.My dear Chloe requested, 
A sprig her fair breast to adorn 
" 
No, by Heaven," I 
exclaimed, " may I 
perish 
If ever I 
plant in that bosom a 
thorn." 
Then I 
showed her the ring, and implored her to marry , 
She blushed like the dawning of morn, 
" 
Yes I'll consent," she replied, " if you promise— 
That no jealous rival shall laugh me to scorn." 
WON'T YOU TELL ME WHY ? 
SKETCH FOR TWO CHARACTERS.—ALICE AND ROBIN. 
Scene, —A country lane. 
[ En ter Rows.] 
ROBIN. --Hope I'm not late. 
No: there's nobody here yet. 
I 
don't think Alice will disappoint me, though to tell the truth I 
deserve to be disappointed. for I 
have not been a 
constant lover. 
Yet, I 
do love Alice dearly, and I 
know she loves me. 
Then, 
you know, females are not the only flirts. 
The male sex can 
do, and do, do a 
little of that sort of thin!! sometimes. 
Here 
she comes. 
I'll appear totally indifferent, although it's a 
shame 
to torture her tender heart. 
I'll hide behind this tree. (hides.)

ALICE.—You. indeed! You have a

ROBIN. — Well. if I

may as well beg 
pardon for this intrusion, and go meet some other pretty girl in

ROBIN sings. 
The change is all in you, Alice, 
Plainly all in y 
on; 
You once were kind and sweet, Alice, 
Once your heart was true. 
The cause you see is in yourself, 
You love me, now, no more, 
Although the reason you'll deny, 
I've told you it before. 
You kaow you've been coquetting. 
Tho' the fact you will deny: 
That's the reason why, Alice, That's the reason why,— 
That's the reason why, Alice, That's the reason why 
ALICE sings. 
The other night we danced, Robin, 
Beneath the hawthorn tree: 
I 
thought you'd surely come, Robin, 
If but to dance with me. 
But Allen asked me first, and so 
I 
joined the reel with him; 
But. I 
was heavy-hearted, 
And my eyes with tears were dim. 
And oh, how very grave you looked 
As once you passed me by: 
Won't you tell me why, Robin, Oh, won't you tell me why, 
Won't you tell me why, Robin, Oh, won't you tell me why ? 
ROBIN sings. 
I 
thought you loved me not, Alice, 
But now I'll doubt no more; 
We'll kiss and make it up, Alice, 
Our quarrels now are o'er. 
ALICE sings. 
I 
only wished to try your love, 
You know my heart is yours; 
' 
Twos so when first we plighted 
The love that still endures. 
BOTH. 
Oh, now we'll let the future show 
Our love can never die: 
You've the reason why 
You've the reason why! 
Alice I 
That's the reason why / 
Robin', 
That's the reason why !

I 
HEARD a 
voice long years ago, 
A voice so wondrous sweet and low, 
That trembling tears unbidden rose 
From the depth's of love's repose; 
It floated through my dreams at night, 
And made the darkest day seem bright; 
It whisper'd to my heart, " My love," 
And nestling there, forgot to rove. 
O 
my love, I 
lov'd her so; 
My love that lov'd me years ago; 
O 
my love, 0 
my love, 
O 
my love, I 
lov'd her so— 
My love that lov'd me years ago. 
But ere our summer pass'd away, 
That gentle voice was hush'd for aye; 
I 
watch'd my love's last smile, and knew 
How well the aw,Tels lov'd her too; 
Then silent, but with blinding tears, 
I 
gather'd all the love of years, 
And laid it with my dream of old, 
AVII2re all I 
lov'd slept white and cold. 
O

lov'd her so—

SULLIVAN'. 
ONLY a 
tress of hair 
lie had stolen one morning bright; 
But the old man dash'd from his cheek a 
tear, 
And murmur'd a 
name to him so dear, 
As he kiss'd it, and gazed through the night! 
" 
Canst thou see me, my darling," he cried 
" 
From thy home with the angels now, 
As I 
watch, where so oft by my side 
Thou bast smiled on me years ago I 
Thou has smiled on me years ago 
I'm sad and lone now thou art gone, 
And oft is my heart like to break. 
Since from hear'n they came my angel to claim, 
And left me to weep and wake! 
But 0! ' twill be sweet when yonder we meet; 
Till then, love, good night—good night." 
Only a 
wither'd flow'r 
She had worn ' mong her ringlets bright, 
But the old man tenderly laid it by 
With the tress he cherisled, with many a 
sigh, 
And again looked far through the niGht! 
" 
Hark !" he whispered, " a 
voice I 
hear 
Through the wind it murmurs low, 
And creeps to my heart so near, 
As a 
voice did years ago, 
As a

'Tis thine, my love, it woos me above, 
To thy home where the weary rest, 
And I

THE TAR'S FAREWELL.— Continued. 
JAM—Nor with Norah. 
How could I 
he faithless to you. 
Were we not school mates together, and were you not my sweet-
heart when I 
was a 
boy ? 
Loo.—Yes; and do you remember how angry you were when 
I 
went home from school with Phillip. just to tease you a 
little? 
JscK.—Oh. yes; and do you remember what a 
sound whaling 
I 
gave that same master Phillip for his impudence? 
Loo.—And it was'nt his fault, one bit! 
JACK.—But now, darling, I 
must be off. 
We sail this morning 
if the wind is fair. 
God bless you, Loo ! 
(The symphony of song is again played.

MARY BLANIE. 
Oh ! once I 
loved a 
yellow gal. 
I 
loved her as my life; 
She came from old Virginia, 
And I 
took her for my wife, 
1Vc happy lived together, 
She never caused me pain ; 
But on one cold and stormy night, 
I 
lost my Mary Blanc. 
MORE'S. 
Farewell ! farewell! poor Mary Blane, 
One faithful heart still thinks of you; 
Farewell ! farewell! poor Mary Blane, 
Tho' we ne'er shall meet again. 
I've nothing left to live for now, 
I'm weary of my life ; 
Then take and lay me gently by 
My poor heart-broken wife. 
I 
wander sadly through the world, 
But find my sorrow's vain ; 
These tears can never bring to me 
My darling Mary Blanc. 
Farewell ! farewell! tic.. 
I 
buried her at dead of night, 
'Neath the persimmon tree; 
De snow was failing thick and white 
On her dear grave and me; 
And often since in dreams I 
see 
Her well known form again, 
As when I 
laid her in de grave. 
And wept o'er Mary Blanc, 
Farewell ! farewell I & c. 
Then raise no tombstone on de place, 
But lay me by her side; 
The best, the kindest of her race-
My faithful, constant bride. 
I'm ready now to leave this life, 
To join her once again, 
Beneath the old persimmon tree, 
Where sleeps my Mary 1;lane. 
C'arewell! farewell !

GAY LIFE IN NEW YORK; 
- 
FAST MEN AND GRASS WIDOWS. 
BY AN OLD TRAVELLER. 
Here we have the Empire City as it is—not as it ought to be. New 
York is the greatest Cosmopolitan City on the Earth's surface. 
Something 
of every city is to be seen here. 
The most advanced Communist touches 
.elbows with the proudest scions of the most artistic families of the Old 
World. 
Vices such as sapped the might of Babylon and Rome, and are 
sapping the manhood of Vienna, of Paris, of London, are necessarily de-
scribed in a 
book like this 
Fortunately, New York has a 
glorious offset to 
all this. 
Her deeds of charity are extensive enough to cover with an ample 
mantle all of her misdoings. 
No one really knows New York till he has 
read " Gay Life." 
Price 25 cents. 
FIFTEEN MIMES AROUND NEW YORK. 
More deeds of brightness, more deeds of darkness, are croi. ' tied into

spectable city, where Tune is measured by the steady, slow beating if Grand-
father's Clock 
Gotham is not yet a 
Paradise, and before the annrantlune 
flowers of virtue can be made to bloom here, the black soil mu ,t 
be turned 
up to the sunlight. 
This book performs that office. 
Light is let in upon the

NAPOLEON'S ORACULUM, 
OR, 
BOOK OF FATE. 
The only Complete American, from the Fiftieth 
London Edition. 
This is the oldest, and for that very reason the beet of Fortune Tellers. 
It was compiled in the remote ages, when learned men consulted the stars, 
and watched and interpre t
ed th e decrees of 
f
ate, and i
nquired into and 
often mastered the mysteries of what we vaguely term Chance. 
Certain it 
is, that Bonaparte obtained a 
copy of this book, written upon papyrus. 
He 
curiously consults it. 
From that time a 
gloom overspread his massive brow. 
Did it dimly reveal to him Moscow, Waterloo, St. Helena ? We only know 
it was found in his carriage after his last great tight. 
Tens of thousands 
consult this Oraculurn with daily increasing faith, in its truthful answeriugs.

READY-MADE LOVE- LETTERS. 
comPnisiNG 
Every Style and Fashion of Note and Letter incident to Lovi; 
Courtship, and Marriage, which should pass between 
Ladies and Gentlemen from, First Acqaintance 
to Finol Union. 
This Book teaches plainly— SO plainly that the most simple can 
understand and make use of the lessons taught. 
It tells a Lady how to meet a 
Gentleman's advances. When to seem a 
little forward ; when to seem a 
title shy. 
How a 
lady should meet, and how 
part from a 
Lover. Shows Ladies and Gentlemen how to act to each other, 
and in company, in all the parts of Bride, Bridegroom, Bridesmaid, and 
Groomsman. How to act at the Altar and at the Wedding Feast. How to 
behave during the Honeymoon, and how and whom to receive and visit. 
In brief, teaches everything that Lovers should know about Court-
ship— its attendant jo sand troubles; of the Marriage Ceremony, its customs 
and the thousand duties, cares and pleasures that attend and follow. 
It is a 
perfect rade snccum. 
Study it and you can act easy, natural, and 
genteel in all the above positions, and pass with success through all these 
most trying and difficult scenes—equally well .with any lady or gentleman 
born to wealth and brought up in fashionable society. 
This Book also tells yon—How to write your first letter to a 
lady. 
How the lady should reply. how a 
gentleman is to tell he loves. 
What the 
lady should write in reply. How a 
gentleman should write to a 
lady, under 
all and any circumstance. What the lady's replies should be. 
Shows how 
widowers as well as bachelors should woo widows, whether young or middle-
aged. 
In short there is not an occasion of any kind calling for a 
correspond-
ence on the subject of Love and Matrimony but what is hero treated of, and 
plainly and fully explained. 
To which are annexed, SPECIMEN LOVE LETTERS, 
written by persons in real lite, in every possible contingency that can occur; 
together with the famous letters of ABELARO and ELOISE, and other cele-
brated lovers. 
Moreover, it contains, A
