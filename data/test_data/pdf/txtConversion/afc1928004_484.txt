I'LL PAINT THE WHITE HOUSE GREEN. 
Sung by PAT ROONEY. 
Copyrighted, 1879, by CLINTON T. 
DE W ITT. 
I'm an Irish poliqcian, 
Yes, a 
man of integrity and fame, 
I'm your candidate for next President, 
Jerry McCormack, that's my name. 
I'm one of the laboring party, 
And its well I 
know my fate ; 
I'll make politicians carry the hod, 
When McCormack rules the State. 
CHORUS. 
Then we'll have no Italian Congressmen, 
And , the Chinese must emigrate ; 
There will be no more four-dollar cigars to smoke, 
When McCormack ruleg the State. 
Then I'll have the White House painted green, 
Coal and wood I'll give away ; 
There be money found upon the street, 
I'll raise the laborers three dollars a 
day. 
I'll bounce Grant's friends from office, 
Then no railroad he'll elevate ; 
I'll have a 
bridge from New York to Ireland, 
When McCormack rules the State. 
Then we'll have 110 Italian, etc. 
THE ABSENT-MINDED MAN. 
Sung by PAT ROONEY. 
Copyrighted, 1879, by CLINTON T. 
B E 
I'LL tell ye a 
story of a 
curious man, 
To entertain ye this evening I'll do what I 
can. 
He was a 
distant relation to bow-legged Sam, 
His nose was as red as a 
sugar-cured ham, 
And his name was Patrickardo :1.1cManahan. 
But he had a 
queer and a 
troublesome fault, 
Like a 
2.40 trotter that has the springhalt ; 
He was quite absent-minded at certain times, 
He'd execute some peculiar unforeseen monkey shines. 
SPOKEN.—Caused by, as several of our learned phy-
sicians informed me, the all-powerful and predominating 
effects coming together and making as it were an absent-
minded man. 
For instance, some morning he'd arise from his bed, 
And in place of a 
hat pat a 
pail on his head ; 
Sometimes he'd imagine that he was the Mayor, 
Or at work for the city as county wind-weigher. 
And he'd dwell on his influence, wealth, and high station, 
With moral presumption and great exultation ; 
lIe'd speak with disdain on Chinese emigration, 
And at certain periods would merit extreme approbation, 
SPOKEN.--And all due to the effect and misfortune of 
being an absent-minded man. 
( 
1 ) 
But he was known and respected all over the town ; 
In his elegant barouche he rode grandly around, 
For he thought at one time he was General Grant's son, 
And he fell in convulsions at the sound of a 
gun. 
He went to a 
pic-nic and got bilin' full, 
And filled the bass drum with molasses candy pull ; 
He sang the Star Strangled Hammer with the greatest of 
ease, 
And read the Declaration of Independence from the fly-
ing trapeze ; 
He lost a 
one thousand dollar diamond, the police tried 
to find it, 
Well, if you believe that, you must be absent-minded. 
But it was very seldom he got on a 
spree ; 
When he couldn't drink coffee he always drank tea ; 
He had an old Spitz dog and a 
bullfoundland pup, 
And at eating and biting they both took the cup. 
He went to the circus, got drinking hard cider, 
And thought he was one'of the bare-back horse riders ; 
He split the tent open in making his leap, 
And fell down on his neck about two hundred feet ; 
With his eyes full of sawdust and very near blinded, 
He says Patrickardo McManahan, you must be absent-
minded. 
WHAT TALMAGE DID NOT SEE. 
As 
sung by TONY PASTOR, with great success. 
A-14.—" Castles in the Air." 
INN.Talmage late to New York came to see each wondrous 
sight, 
To find out if the world went wrong, and make the 
matter right ; 
He visited each curious place where " Life " did find a 
home, 
In fact he had a 
midnightspree as he this town did 
roam; 
I 
did not wish much fault to find, of him to make com-
plaint, 
But think at home by his fireside would have been 
better for a " Saint !" 
No doubt he saw many things of the easy kind and free, 
But some misery lie could help to cure lie had not eyes 
to see. 
He did not see our working girls as the snow was falling 
fast, 
Creep home to attic, cramped and small, thro' the chilly 
wintry blast ; 
Her wretched home of poverty is roofless o'er her head, 
Her heart is bleak and cold and sad ! her meal a 
crust 
of bread. 
lie did not see the twinkling stars shine down from the 
blue sky, 
Upon her upturned face of woe as she lay there to die ; 
Heard not her siffering cry for " help I" as her soul from 
bondage free, 
Sped swiftly to the unknown shore ! THAT Talmage did 
not see. 
WHAT TALMAGE DID NOT SEE .—Concluded. 
He did not see our laboring men in life's sad battle beat, 
Working from daylight until dark that food their wives 
might eat ; 
He did not see dark hunger's cloud grow denser every 
day, 
Nor capital, with iron hand drag down each workman's 
PaY 
He did not see each savings bank, our poor hard earnings 
win, 
He went where luxury abounds in the halls of gilded 
sin ; 
The outcasts of the gutter he, in scorn did let them be, 
No hand he them reached out to save, such sights he 
did not see. 
I 
have often pondered in my mind, he had better go to 
work, 
And purify his own good town before he tries New 
York; 
I never thought that Brooklyn was the long sought 
" 
promised land," 
Or even that its 
parsons were the famous Gideon's 
Band. 
I 
hope before he next starts out in search of sin to roam. 
He'll use his purifying broom and sweep much nearer 
home; 
Or if he must keep on his course and will not let us be, 
he'll give a 
dime and not a 
tract when misery he does 
see. 
THE McGLUGGENS. 
Composed by JOE BURGESS, and sung by the BURGESSES with 
immense success at the Olympic Theatre, Brooklyn. 
So now we are here ! we bid good cheer 
To all our new-made friends, 
And sing a 
song, it won't be long, 
And we wish your kind amends. 
We've been here but a 
day or so 
From that Emerald Isle so grand, 
We are the two MeGluggens 
From dear old Ireland. 
CHORUS. 
Then sing it aloud and let the people know. 
Give us a 
hold of your hand; 
We are tbe two McGluggens 
From dear old Ireland. 
(Repeat.) 
And now, kind friends, we must away, 
For work now we must try, 
And should good luck fall in our way 
To the Green Isle we will fly. 
It's the country true and noble, 
Where they'd shake us by the hand, 
And bid welcome to the McGluggens 
Back to old Ireland. 
Then sing aloud, etc. 
JULIA. 
Sung by PAT ROONEY. 
Copyri,ghted, 1879, by CLINTON T. 
DE W ITT. 
I'VE a 
daughter Julia, 
She is seventeen, 
And I'm told by all the neighbors, 
She looks like a 
queen. 
You should see her dancing, 
At it she's engaged, 
In the ballet she's the star, 
For she's on the stage. 
She can dance upon her toes. (Break.) 
To the music around she goes. (Break!) 
CTIOEUS. 
Dancing on the stage, 
Oh, but she does please, 
Around she glides with graceful form, 
And with, oh, such ease. 
She's a 
little beauty, 
And I 
will engage, 
There is not another girl, 
Like Julia on the stage. 
When the music's playing, 
How the people shout ; 
On the stage they throw bouquets, 
When Julia does come out. 
Like a 
shadow gliding, 
Dressed sometimes as page, 
In the play to king or queen, 
My Julia's on the stage. 
She's her father's joy and pride. (Break.) 
Like a 
fairy ylph she glides. (
Break.) 
Dancing on the stage, etc.

In a

The sweetest little form I

That's it. 
Oh, if Mrs. S. knew I

Reads.) " Young lady in stage would like

That's a very strange coincident, indeed

M RS. SNIP. Good afternoon, my dear. 
M R. SNIP. Oh, good afternoon, my sweet.

No horrid, truthless husband 
Should worry out my life, 
But I 
should live in gladness, 
And be no loveless wife. 
CHORUS. 
I'd choose to be unwedded, 
If I 
might have my say ; 
I'd never then be jealous, 
Nor pine, in tears, all day. 
Now to trap my Snippy, the wretch ! 
This hat and 
veil will do the business. 
He don't know I've borrowed 
them. (Puts on hat and veil.) 
Two can play at his game.

SCENE II.—A Street. 
Enter M R. SNIP. 
Mn. S. Nearly half a 
second late ! 
I 
hope she'll come. 
I 
am in ecstatic joy at the prospect of meeting her ! 
Ah, 
there is the zulgel coming up the block. 
Be still, my 
heart, be still ! 
Enter M RS. SNIP, veiled. 
Mn. S. Have I 
the pleasure of addressing the dear un-
known whom I 
met in a 
stage ? 
Illus. S. Yes. (
aside) Oh, the villain ! 
Mn. S. I 
was stricken at my first glance. 
Mils. S. And so was I. 
Mr. S. And so you put in the personal, not knowing 
that I 
had done so ? 
M RS. S. Yes. 
Mn. S. How romantic! 
Mits. S. (
aside) I'll romantic him ! 
Mn. S. Pray let me behold that sweet smile, and the 
light of those eyes once more. 
Mits. S. As you wish. 
(Takes off veil.) 
Mn. S. Mrs. Snip, by all that's infernal ! 
Mits. S. Yes, and this is your constitutional, is it ? 
Mn. S. Ha ! ha ! 
It was all a 
joke ! 
Mils. S. Oh, it was all a 
joke, was it ? 
Mn. S. Of course, my dear. (
aside) How could she 
have got on my track ? 
Mus. H. When you write a 
personal again, my dear, 
be careful to destroy the first 
draft of 
it. 
(Shows 
crumpled piece of paper.) 
Mn. S. I 
own up, my love. 
I 
have been outwitted. 
Do forgive me, and I 
shall remain from henceforth your 
devoted Snip. 
Mits. S. I 
have a 
mind to be angry, but I 
can't. 
Here's 
my hand.

My dearest one, we'll nevermore 
A 
word of anger know ; 
You are the heart I 
still adore, 
No matter where I 
go. 
Oh, bright and peaceful be each hour, 
Till life shall pass away ; 
Your smile shall be, like lovely flower, 
My joy from day to day.

COUGH, 
JOHN, 
COUGH, 
AND MAKE THE BABY 
LAUGH. 
As sung by NED BARRY, with great success. 
You see that I'm a 
married man, at least I .think you 
ought, 
By eighteen months of wedded bliss some trouble I've 
been taught, 
I'm father of a 
bouncing boy who's always wide awake ; 
And I've to cough to keep it quiet until my jaws they 
ache. 
SPoii-Ex.—Yes, I'm the happy parent of a 
crying doll. 
I've bought rattles, India rubber tooth-rings, sugar-sticks, 
and everything else I 
could think of, but it is impossible 
to keep the child quiet, except in one manner ; and that 
is why my wife is always crying out— 
CHORUS. 
Cough, John, cough, John, cough, and make the baby 
laugh, 
Cough, John, cough, John, and make the baby laugh, 
Why don't you keep it still ? it's crying makes in.; ill, 
Cough, cough, cough John, and make the baby laugh. 
Some call. the baby pretty pet, and ask us out to tea, 
Where I've to act the part of nurse, and dance it on my 
knee ; 
13 
COUGH, JOHN, COUGH, AND MAKE THE BABY 
LAUGH.—Coneluded. 
My wife she sits down with the rest to have a 
great blow 
out, 
But as the blessed infant squalls, to me she's sure to 
shout— 
Cough, John, etc. 
I 
never get a 
wink of sleep, for when in bed at night, 
The baby's sure to waken up, and cry out with affright ; 
My wife commands me with one word, and then begins 
to snore 
While I've to hug that wretched child about the cham-
ber floor. 
SrokEs.--Fancy me roused from my virtuous couch at 
midnight by a 
dig in the ribs, and told to carry that 
wretched baby about in my night-shirt, singing, " Hush 
a-by-baby," etc. 
It's Don't you hear, John ; wake up, 
John ; get up, John, and 
Cough, John, etc. 
My trouble never has an end, it's morning, night and 
noon ; 
If I 
continue coughing so, I'll have a 
coffin soon ; 
I 
hear the baby crying now, and as my throat is sore ; 
If you, my friends, will cough with me, you'll quiet it 
I'm sure. 
SPOKEN. --I 
feel as though I 
had the whooping cough, 
and could swallow a 
box of cough lozenges. 
So just 
to keep the baby quiet, we'll

OFFICER REILLY'S CLUB. 
Sung by PAT R OONEY. 
Copyrighted, 1879, by CLINTON T. 
DE W ITT. 
On, there was a 
gang of spellers, 
Who on the corner stood ; 
They'd take in all the balls and hops, 
Brace every place they could. 
They'd no ticket of admission, 
And would hang up for their grub, 
Till at Hogan's ball their heads were broke 
By Officer Reilly's club. 
CII01TCS. 
There was brocky-faced young Do°lan 
And old Pat Moylan's sons, 
With cross-eyed Teddy Leary, 
In their stockings carried guns ; 
There was jealous-leg Maguffin, 
Who around the room did prance, 
Till Reilly socked him in the ear, 
And knocked him in a. trance. 
Now tobacco juice was flowing— 
Miss Burke was almost dead ; 
Bough Crogan ran between her feet, 
And stood her on her head. 
She shouted melia murder, 
Some one struck her in the gob ; 
Be heavens ! I 
would take an oath, 
It was Officer Reilly's club. 
• 
There was brocky-faced, etc. 
Faith, the gang all makes for Reilly— 
He had all that he could do ; 
His nose was like a 
pudding, 
And his eyes were black and blue. 
Oh, they pulled the shirt clean off him 
And the legs out of his pants, 
And fired him out upon the floor 
To do them a 
song and dance. 
There was brocky-faced, etc.

THE DAY I TRAVELLED WITH BARNUM'S 
SHOW. 
An original Irish Comic Song. 
Written by JAS. R ICHMOND. 
Sung by PAT ROONEY. 
Copyrighted, 1879, by CLINTON T. 
DE W ITT. 
M Y 
name is Mike O'llallahan, 
I 
am on the tight-rope and the slack-wire ; 
I 
travelled with Barnum's for thirteen years. 
Under the name of Signor McGuire. 
I 
threw double sommersaults on my ear, 
A 
hundred flip-flaps I 
can throw ; 
I 
used to eat cannon balls for my dinner, 
When I 
travelled with Barnum's Show. 
CHORUS. 
I 
done a 
Highland fling on a 
horizontal bar, 
I 
killed a 
lion with a 
blow. 
I 
used to hide from the Sheriff in the elephant's trunk, 
When I 
travelled with Barnum's Show. 
I 
done the statue clog with the fat woman, 
And I 
learned the monkey to play the cornet, 
I 
slept in the cage with the animals, 
-When it rained I 
got soaking wet. 
It was me that painted the tattooed Greek, 
And I 
want ye all to know, 
I 
was the greatest curiosity out, 
When I 
travelled with Barnum's Show. 
I 
done a 
highland fling, etc.

Copy righted, 1870, by CLINTON T. 
DE W ITT. 
I'VE a 
story I'm going to tell ye's all, 
Of a 
darlint—a lovely Irish girl ; 
She's a 
picture, true to Nature, 
A 
pretty Irish girl. 
She's handsome and lovely as a 
rose, 
Such a 
darlint I 
never met before ; 
You will know her if you see her, 
She's from Auld Ireland's shore. 
CHORUS. 
I 
call her Katie dear, (
Break.) 
I 
love her when she's near ; (Break.) 
She's a 
darlint, and to her I'll be true. 
Her picture I 
carry in my heart, 
Shure, I 
left her home in Ireland, 
Across in the old dart. 
Ye's may talk about your lovely girls, 
But whin you see this little dear, 
You'll imagine she's a 
fairy. 
I'm happy when she's near ; 
Her face and form is like the lily, 
Her eyes so lovely Irish blue ; 
She's a 
darlint, I 
adore her, 
To me I 
know she's true. 
I 
call her Katie, etc.

" 
Beautiful Isle of the Sea." 
BEAUTIFUL isle of the sea, 
Smile on the brow of the waters ! 
Dear are your mem'ries to me, 
Sweet as the songs of your daughters. 
Over your mountains and vales, 
Down by each murmuring river, 
Cheered by the flower lowing gales, 
Oh, could I— 
"Let the Angels In." 
Open wide the door, mother, 
And let the angels in ! 
They are so bright and fair, mother, 
So pure and free from sin. 
I 
hear them speak my name, mother, 
They softly whisper, come ! 
Oh, let the angels in, mother, 
They wait to take me— 
" 
Sweet Evelina." 
Way down in the hollow, where the lilies do grow, 
Where winds from the mountains whistle their wild note ; 
There lives Evelina, a 
sweet little cherub, 
The pride of the vale, and the gal that I 
love. 
Dear Evelina ! sweet Evelina ! 
My love for you will never, never die. 
Dear Evelina ! sweet Evel.i!.-

" 
MeSwagan from Mayo." 
Oh, its lately I've missed her, 
Sure I 
mane me sister; 
She's strong as a 
bull, 
And she strikes a 
hard blow. 
Her cheeks they are rosy. 
And neat as a 
posey ; 
At the big Castle Garden 
She lauded below. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, say have you seen her, 
To you I'd describe her— 
She wears a 
red petticoat, 
And a 
hat on her head ; 
She moves when she's walking, 
She speaks when she's talking ; 
On her petticoat is marked  
" 
Would I 
were a 
Boy again." 
Oh, would I 
were a 
boy again, 
When life seemed formed of sunny 
And all the heart then knew of pain 
Was swept away in transient tears. 
When every tale hope whispered then, 
My fancy deemed was only truth ; 
Oh, would that I 
could know again  
years,— 
" 
High-
born Liver Daniel." 
Satan tempted Eve, 
Eve tempted man ; 
Hadn't been for the mercy of the Lord, 
We'a all been cussed in the land.

Nigger man he picks cotton, 
Little bees sip the honey, 
Colored man he works all day long, 
And white man gets the money. 
CHORUS. 
'Case he's a

Daniel, Daniel, 
He's a 
high-born liver Daniel, 
I'm going to

Come where my Love lies Dreaming." 
Come where my love lies dreaming, 
Dreaming the happy hours away ; 
In visions bright redeeming, 
The fleeting joys of day. 
Dreaming the happy hours, 
Dreaming the happy hours away, 
" 
The Day we Celebrate." 
Come all ye brave bold Irishmen, 
Wherever you may be, 
On Patrick's day, we'd march away, 
In each society ! 
The ancient order of Hibernians, 
Father Matthew temperance men, 
The sprig of Shamrock and Fenians, too, 
On the 17th of March fall in ! 
CHORUS, 
Arrah ! the drums do roll ; 
The marshals ride ; 
I

To see the Sons of Erin's Is19, 
On the day we celebrate !

THE NEIGHBORS ON OUR BLOCK. 
Written by W ASH FAvon, for the 
Irish Emperors," FAVOR and 
SHIELDS. 
Now I'll try for to tell ye me troubles, 
And what l'm going to relate 
It happens to me almost daily, 
In this unfortunate unlucky State. 
I 
have a 
large family of children, 
And they never wore shoe nor a 
sock, 
But they all kick up the very (Evil 
With the neighbors that's on the same block. 
There's Cornelius, the youngest of eleven, 
He's a 
twin to his big brother Gile, 
That's left him and went off to heaven, 
To spend six years upon the Isle. 
And Patsy, the bum, as they call him, 
Was hauled in for picking a 
lock, 
And Mickey got licked like the (Evil, 
By the neighbors that live on our block. 
Now there's Polly, my only daughter, 
Who's just turned twelve years of age ; 
She's skipping and dancing the tra la lu, 
The same as they do on the stage. 
But the rest of the 'ha.) s 
have me crazy, 
For on every one's door they do knock ; 
And I'm sure they'll be sent to the Island 
By the neighbors that's on the same block. 
NORAII JOHANNA McCARTHY. 
Ccmposed and sung by P. 
J. 
DOWNEY. 
AIR.—" Mary, the Pride of the Dairy." 
I 
RECEIVED an invite to attend a 
large party, 
The Ladies Choice Social, up at Stella Hall ; 
I 
put on my best clothes, white necktie and collar, 
Plug hat, with new gaiters' to dance at the ball. 
Of girls I 
had plenty to go along with me, 
They said I 
was always so gay and so free ; 
I 
took Miss McCarthy, so young and so pretty, 
She swore at the party the belle she would be. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, Norah Johanna McCarthy, 
She swore she'd be belle of the party, 
If any would slight, she was ready to fight, 
Was Norah Johanna McCarthy. 
The fun it commenced with a 
two hand kertillion, 
Norah went at it with hop, step and jump, 
Killfeather he tripped her, oh, boys, what a 
ruction, 
:\.Torah's poor body received a great bump. 
Her legs they flew up, she had on striped stockings, 
She bounced off her bustle, her head hit the wall, 
Oh, boys, she's a 
ripper, cried old Paddy Coldwell. 
You, lie, said O'Brien, she's the belle of the ball. 
Oh, Norah Johanna, etc. 
Come, boys, cried out Norah, it's time for the supper. 
Hold on, said Miss Dunn, you're an hour to soon ; 
Olt, boys, cried out Norah, to me she's dictating, 
Look out, and I'll gouge her eye out with a 
spoon. 
It's then that the Connellys, O'Briens, and Donnellys, 
ragans, the -
Bagfuls for help they did call, 
With sleeves to the muscle, she pulled off her bustle, 
Oh, boys, cried out Paddy, she'll murder us all. 
Oh, Norah Johanna, etc. 
RACHEL, THE PRIDE OF THE BALLET. 
Written and sung by DAVE HOWARD. 
My name it is Solomon Cohn, 
I 
keep a 
large clothing store, 
And a 
daughter I've got—only one— 
And she's got my whole body sore. 
She goes to the show every night, 
No longer this I 
will stand, sir, 
If I 
say anything to her, she'll say, 
"I'm a 
great ballet dancer." 
CHORUS. 
On the stage her name is Sehlimosky, 
Her right name is Rachel Schlivensky ; 
She comes home every night, and bully blind tight, 
With a 
pair of black eyes she's a 
terrible sight ; 
She is my only daughter, she drinks nothing but Croton 
water. 
She's got a 
big nose, you could hang on your clothes, 
And the pride of the ballet is Rachel. 
She's going to get married next week. 
To a 
handsome song-and-dance actor, 
And he says he'll make her look sweet 
When she's a 
good ballet dancer. 
He'll make her go around on her toes, 
Over in Niblo's Theater ; 
But she's got such a 
terrible nose, 
I 
don't think the managers will take her. 
On the stage her name, etc. 
SWELLS OF THE DAY. 
Comic Song, by BEN COLLINS, Esq. 
Sung by PAT ROONEY. 
Copyrighted, 1879, by CLINTON T. 
DE W
ITT. 
Now a 
comical song I'm going to sing, 
And I 
think you'll agree with me too, 
It's about the young men we every day meet, 
And the facts I 
believe are all true. 
They'll stand on the corner for twenty-four hours, 
They'll wink, and they'll blink, and they'll stare ; 
With Sherman House toothpicks and three-cent cigars, 
And bad hair oil all over their hair. 
CHORUS. 
They are the swells of the day, 
Oh, that's what the police all say ; 
Their gold watch is brass, their diamonds arc glass, 
But still they're the swells of the day. 
They'll hang around our large hotels, 
A 
burden to the city ; 
To see them on a 
rainy day, 
Wouldn't move your pocket to pity. 
They'll spit tobacco all over the walk, 
I 
wish they were in Jerusalem ; 
There is Augustus, George, Girard, and Oliver, 
, 
And Don Pedro alamagozlems. 
C1TORCS. 
They're par excellence, 
I 
wish they'd leave the town ; 
Why can't they go out West, 
Or where they can't he found ? 
Oh my, them second-hand hats, 
Look dizzier every day ; 
I 
wish they were buried with Brigham Young, 
Ten thousand miles away. 
They'll bow to every lady 
And they'll try and look thcir best ; 
They'll button up that linen duster 
To hide their old-time vest. 
They'll go in a 
bar-room, step up to the counter 
And drink when they know they can't 
If the bArtender murmurs " Please settle that round," 
They'll wink their brunette eye and say— 
c 
By-and-by, by-and-by, they'll say 
" 
Charge it," and then hurry to the door ; 
" 
Drink with me, tin la la le, 
1 
will treat on that beautiful shore." 
THE FIFTH AVENUE FAIR. 
Written by BEN COLLINS, of TuuxEn & COLLINS, and sung by 
TONY PASTOR with great success. 
IF you will listen awhile to the song I 
will sing, 
I 
will tell you some funny and curious things ; 
It isn't Whoa Emma i 
or our Front Stoop, 
Nor my My Mary Ann, for she has the croup ; 
It aint Where was Moses, or the isle De Blackwell, 
But I'm sure when you've heard it your head it will swell. 
So list to the words and don't mind the air, 
And I'll tell you about the Fifth Avenue Fair. 
Susan B. Anthony, she had a 
stand, 
And was selling cheap tickets for the promised land ; 
Mary Walker was there, but got full of booze, 
And they raffled her off with O'Leary's big shoes. 
Dennis Kearney was talking to Moody and Sank, 
Fixing a 
job on the Manhattan Bank ; 
0 
wney Geoghegan came in with bear grease on his hair, 
And was too sweet to live at the Fifth Avenue Fair. 
There was bald-headed babies and lively mammas, 
Ancient old maidens and half full papas ; 
Two blushing young girls had a 
boxing glove fight, 
And said Francis Murphy was a 
little bit tight. 
Mrs. Jinks she got up for a 
temperance speech, 
But she fell through the floor with a 
terrible screech 
Harry Hill he rushed in with a 
rush-bottomed chair, 
But they all rushed him out at the Fifth Avenue Fair. 
Hughes, the pedestrian, started to walk, 
All the widows sat down for a 
long-winded talk ; 
Gallant Ben Butler got in on a 
check, 
Two song and dance men got in on their neck. 
The hero of Baxter street waltzed a 
quadrille, 
A 
deaf and dumb man was talking to handsome Tom 
Gill ; 
Dr. Tahnage was sleeping in Washington Square, 
And missed all the sin at the Fifth Avenue Fair. 
GREENHORN ON THE FLY. 
13.vised and sung by JOHNNY ROACH with great success. 
GOOD people all, take my advice, and listen unto me, 
But don't put too much confidence in every man you see. 
They say fine feathers make fine birds, but not so every 
one, 
For men will often wear broadcloth, to hide their little 
game, 
But whether they are fish or fowl it makes no difference 
to I, 
I 
know my business, you can bet, I'm a 
greenhorn on the 
fly. 
There's Madame Morris from Corsica, who with her tele-
scope, 
Your future wife or husband shows—good gracious ! that's 
a 
joke. 
If you give to her but fifty cents, she'll send you a 
card 
by mail, 
I 
think they ought to find her a 
home, six months in the 
county jail. 
There's the seventh daughter of the seventh son, to swin-
dle you they'll try, 
But I 
know their little euchre game, I'm a 
greenhorn on 
the fly. 
In Chatham street the other day I 
took a 
walk along, 
I 
heard a 
fellow crying out, b
ooincr, going, gone. 
'n 
Who bids for it, this fine ..old watch, the finest ever seen. 
They thought I 
was a 
little fiat—perhaps a 
little green— 
I 
says, excuse me, please, if I 
wink so with my eye, 
I 
know my business, you can bet I'm a 
greenhorn on the 
fly. 
There are fifty kinds of swindling- mills in the papers 
every (
lay, 
And lotteries where you draw a 
farm (God knows how far 
away) ; 
The police say they searched very hard to find old Stew-
art's corpse, 
But I 
don't think they looked very far from the city of 
New York. 
If Judge Hilton had been wise, my friends, fifty thousand 
dollars he might have laid by, 
U he'd given that job to some one else,says the greenhorn 
that is fly. 
GRANT'S DEFEAT IN CORK. 
As sung by TONY PA.STO; with great success, in the principal 
Theatres in the Union. 
A 
SAD and mournful story I 
unto you now must tell, 
The greatest man of modern times, like gold to par has 
fell 
I 
mean the mighty General Grant who late has met 
defeat, 
And for the first time in his life has had to beat retreat. 
He commenced his victories long ago upon the Rio 
Grande, 
And next he bottled Butler up like a 
whiskey of choice 
brand, 
He eat tallow with the Russians, smoked his hookah with 
the Turk, 
But never met his master till he heard that news from 
Cork. 
lie drank with Queen Victoria and was a 
Cockney made, 
Tie sausage eat with Bismarck and was not a 
bit afraid, 
Saw the ancient tombs in Egypt, went to Cairo down the 
Nile, 
lie winked an eye at Beaconsfield and with him took a 
smile. 
He lager got in Austria, sailed up the sunny Rhine, 
Got a 
pretzel from King -William, out of sour krout took 
the shine, 
Success made him so reckless he saw not the danger lurk, 
From that mighty board of Aldermen that sits in the 
County Cork. 
GRANT'S DEFEAT IN CORK.— Concluded. 
In Spain he hunted foxes, and with Alphonso dined, 
And I'm told he kissed a 
Spanish girl, but that I 
do not 
mind, 
With the Sultan of Turkey he went his harem through, 
But Mrs. Grant was close behind, so he nothing wrong 
could do. 
Was an Irishman in Dublin made and drank some sweet 
potheen, 
Threw down the good cigar he smoked to puff an old 
" 
dudeen," 
And yet misfortune came at last, in vain he it did shirk, 
The Alderman shut down on him inside the County Cork. 
The Democrats will laugh and grin, the Greenbackers 
will smile, 
The politicians with affrigTh,t will think of Erin's Isle, 
To think that those bold sons of Cork should dare de-
fiance fling 
To him who in Bulgaria's land had chance to be a 
king. 
Let all the world in mourning go, and each man shed a 
tear, 
The splendor of -Ulysses Grant it vanished with the year ; 
This man who in his lifetime never did a " battle shirk," 
Must now where grows the Shamrock green be vanquished 
by a " Cork." 
MR. CARNEY FROM THE LAKESIDE. 
Originally sung with success by C. P. 
HYLAND. 
W REN I 
left dear old Ireland, 
On a 
bright sunny morn, 
And parted there on dry land, 
The place where I 
was born ; 
I 
landed here in the middle of the year, 
Just off the Battery ; 
And made my trip on a 
great big ship, 
And came to America. 
CHORUS. 
For I 
come from sweet Killarney by the lakeside, 
Where the pretty little ducks and drakes ride ; 
For my name is Mr. Carney, 
From the lakes of sweet Killarney, 
In the land where the floury praties grow. 
As soon as ever I 
landed, 
My friends wanted to know 
how things were in old Ireland, 
Where the floury praties grow. 
They told me I 
was welcome, 
And took me by the hand ; 
Then we danced and sung till morning light, 
In praise of Paddy's land. 
For I 
come from, etc. 
So now I'll say good evening, 
I 
can no longer stay ; 
I've done my best to please you, 
And it's time I 
was away. 
So now I 
must be leaving, 
And just before I 
go, 
We'll give three cheers for Erin, 
Where the floury praties grow, 
For I 
come from, etc. 
MAJOR MAGOOZLUM. 
Written by W ASH. FAVOR for the " Irish Emperors," FAVOR and 
SHIELDS. 
W E 
are two gallant soldier boys 
That you very seldom meet; 
And though we never refuse a 
drink, 
We were never known to treat. 
We work the lunch routes every day, 
And get taffy on a 
stick, 
From the fellows that's fly, they give us the guy, 
But we're never known to kick. 
CHORUS. 
Major Magoozlum, just from Jerusalem, 
Where we've been training the Turks how to fight; 
They call us two guagers, the Judge and the Major, 
But still we go mashing the girls all night. 
We never get cranky, for Moody and Sankey 
Told us it was a 
sin ; 
We never do fight, if ever we're tight, 
But at our work we begin. 
We draws the cans from under our coats, 
And drain the kegs for beer; 
We drink it quite sly, and wink our left eye, 
Then walk off on our ear.

MIXED CANDIES.

CARTER. 
Sung by Par ROONEY, 
Copyriqlited, 1879, by r',IANTON T. Dr. WITT 
THERE'S a 
letter in the candle, 
And it points to baby mine ; 
Nancy Lee has broke the crystal 
To the watch upon the Rhine ; 
Kitty Clyde has pinched her feet, 
To keep herself up in the style ; 
And Ben Bolt has stole the waterfall 
Of gentle Annie Lisle. 
I 
am sitting on the stile to-day, 
A 
hundred in the shade, 
With old Muldoon the solid man, 
Of Patrick's day parade. 
He tried one day to stop a 
ball, 
With Spaulding at the bat, 
But a 
fielder caught him on the nose, 
And busted :Muldoon's hat. 
Put my little shoes away, 
When the swallows homeward fly ; 
The man up in the moon will laugh, 
To see the well run dry. 
Oh Mollie dear, will you be true, 
When I 
am far at sea ? 
And don't be flirting in the park 
With the fellow that looks like me. 
Charley Ross has been discovered, 
Where the leaves begin to fall ; 
Dennis Kearney lost his hatchet, 
But he done it for a 
stall. 
He left his dray in Frisco, 
For to elevate his means, 
And Yankee Doodle filled him up, 
With Boston pork and beans. 
Grandpa's clock has just been buried, 
You will miss it now it's gone, 
For they'll -never resurrect it, 
Till old Gabriel blows his horn. 
The devil's dream of little Maud, 
The organ-grinders test, 
The silver threads among the gold, 
Will have to take a 
rest.

BILLY'S APPEAL TO HIS MA. 
33 
Sung by PAT ROONEY. 
GIVE my boxing-gloves to brother, moraraie, when I'm 
dead, 
When the sexton puts me under in my little bed ; 
If the job is like to throw him when the string he jerks, 
Get some little boy to show him how the old thing works, 
(Repeat last line.) 
Mamma, buy me a 
bran new Ulster, hire a 
Pullman car, 
Give me a 
bath of Florida water, I 
see the gates ajar; 
Give me a 
dose of paregoric—there's nothing about me 
mean, 
Give the sexton half a 
dollar to see that my grave's kept 
green. 
(Repeat last line.) 
Give my chewing gum to sister, I 
don't want it any more, 
On my lips it raised a 
blister that was awful sore ; 
Sing to me the Last Rose of Summer—mamma, don't you 
cry, 
For in the clouds I'll raise a 
racket, in the sweet by and 
by. 
(Repeat last line.) 
Sprinkle my body with powdered sugar, smear me over 
with tar. 
Cover my form with peacock's feathers —I 
want to be an 
angel, ma; 
Let me bite the old tom cat's tail off, he can't ketch no 
mice, 
Let me go bathing with the girls—it's naughty but it's 
(Repeat last line.)

O'REILLY'S RAFFLE. 
Words by JOHN PEASLEY. 
Sung with great success by the 
REASLEYS. 
I'LL tell you of a 
jolly time 
We had while at O'Reilly's raffle, 
Some were dancing, SOHIC were singing, 
Others making rots of fun. 
Some were dancing with their partners, 
Others kissing in the corners, 
Music playing, whiskey flying, 
At O'Reilly's raffle. 
We were called up to the bar' 
We took a 
drink with Paddy O'Mar, 
Mickey Flynn, who had the most, 
he got up and gave a 
toast. 
CHORUS. 
Here's good luck to all the party— 
James Muldoon and Biddy McCarty. 
Michael Dolan Teddy Regan, 
Danced the (lust out of the floor. 
Here's to all the pritty ladies— 
Katy Mack, the two O'Bradys, 
We won't forget the time we had 
While at O'Reilly's raffle. 
We played all games and danced all dances. 
From the break-down to the lancers, 
Cracking jokes and telling; stories, 
The girls all were in their glory. 
Some were eating, some were thinking, 
Sonic were sleeping, some were drinking, 
Others shaking for the turkeys, 
At O'Reilly's raffle. 
Then the ruction soon began, 
'Twas woman to woman, and man to man, 
Broken chairs began to fly, 
One struck me right over my eye. 
CHORUS. 
Music playing, whiskey flying, 
Some were laughing, some were crying, 
Others taking off their coats, 
And getting ready for a 
fight. 
The girls they began a- squealing, 
The big blaguards they had no feeling, 
At it right and left they went, 
And busted O'Reilly's raffle. 
O'HOOLAHAN, WHAT DER YOU SAY? 
Composed and sung with great success by CHARLES A. 
GREAR, 
America's Own Mimic. 
GOOD evening to you, one and all, 
I'm glad to find you well, 
To listen to my tale of woes 
That I'm about to tell. 
I 
cannot take my daily walks, 
And I'll tell you the reason why, 
The gang all shout out as I 
walk out, 
O'Hoolahan, what der you say ? 
cuomts. 
They're setting me almost crazy now, 
And I'll tell you the reason why, 
For the gang all shout as I 
walk out. 
O'Hoolahan, what der you say ? 
I 
stepped into a 
restaurant 
To get a 
bite to eat, 
I 
thought I 
would enjoy myself, 
And none of the gang I'd meet ; 
The waiter look'd at me and laughed ; 
Says I, give me a 
custard pie, 
When through the hall he did loudly bawl, 
O'Hoolahan, what der you say ? 
They're setting me, etc. 
Sung by NED BARRY. 
I 
LEAD a 
very homely life in a 
quiet sort of way, 
I 
like well to enjoy, and not feel over gay ; 
Fast life does not agree with me at any time or place, 
I've travelled nearly through this world at quite a 
quiet 
pace. 
CHORUS. 
A 
quiet little home in a 
quiet little way, 
A 
quiet little wife sitting quiet all the day 
A 
quiet little parlor, a 
quiet cup of tea, 
A 
life of peace and quietness, that's the life for me. 
I 
like to have a 
social song, I 
like my pipe and glass, 
I 
love my wife, I 
love my friends with whom the time to 
pass ; 
A 
reasonable hour to rest, an early hour to rise, 
'Twill make a 
man both healthy, wealthy, prosperous and 
wise, 
A 
quiet little home, etc. 
So now, my friends, take my advice, and do the best you 
Can 
To earn a 
name that will become an honest workingman ; 
Study the comforts of your home, and very soon you'll 
find 
A 
life of peace and quietness is best suited to the mind. 
A 
quiet little home, etc. 
A PARODY ON " BABY MINE." 
Written expressly for the " Irish Emperors," FAVOR and SHIELDS, 
by BILLY ROBINSON. 
On, my wife she is a 
slugger, 
Baby mine, baby mine, 
Like a 
trotting horse we rub her, 
Baby mine, baby mine. 
Oh, she hit me with a 
brick, 
But my head it was too thick, 
So you see I 
broke the brick, 
Baby mine, baby mine. 
But I'll hit her and -knock her sick, baby mine. 
Oh, the babies on our block, 
How they bawl, how they squall 
For their fathers and their mothers 
At the Skidmore's fancy ball. 
I'll meet you in the hall-way door, 
Something I 
never done before, 
But the villain still puksued her, 
Baby mine, baby mine. 
Get thee gone, get thee gone, baby mine. 
She has chin whiskers on her nose, 
Baby mine, baby mine, 
Oh heavens ! how it grows, 
Baby mine, baby mine, 
She was a 
pastry cook, 
Her mother and me she shook 
For to dance in the Black Crook, 
Baby mine, baby mine. 
Forty dollars from me she took, baby mine.

MicnAEL Slattery was a 
tailor, 
He was ninety years of age, 
lie had a 
son named Mickey, 
He was a 
play actor on the stage. 
He'd play Hamlet with his sister, 
For diamonds he'd give her pork and beans ; 
Then Little Michael Slattery, 
Tore all the bed-clothes up for scenes. 
CHORUS. 
Then it's Little Michael Slattery, 
lie stele his father's pants, 
He cut -
1,1..em up for skin- tights, 
For to do a 
song and dance. 
When his mother was asleep, 
lie cut her hair off for a 
wig ; 
Now little Michael Slattery, 
Is doing an acrobatic jig. 
His father had him arrested 
For playing Romeo and King Lear ; 
He called the Judge a 
liar, 
And he got six months twice a 
year. 
While in jail he wrote a 
drama, 
And shot the keeper in the toes ; 
Now little Michael Slattery 
Is doing the essence on his nose. 
Then it's little Michael Slattery, etc,

Not led by any one's fashion.

The style in which I

And pretty girls they all know me, 
As the swell with a

CHORUS. 
For a

Because I'm a 
jolly good fellow ; 
I'm envied by swells, adored by the belles, 
When out with my Pink Umbrella. 
While strolling through the park the other day, 
Just luckily it came raining ; 
It's there I 
met a 
lady gay, 
Of the weather she was complaining. 
She said her hat and shawl would spoil, 
I 
told her she could shelter, 
Then she consented with a 
smile, 
To walk beneath my Pink Umbrella. 
For a 
concert, etc, 
Now I'm not of your iar-da-da sort, 
That think people vulgar when jolly ; 
I'm a 
fellow that's very fond of sport, 
Though people call it folly. 
I'd rather my life be sweet and short, 
Than live forever in a 
cellar, 
Not one of your miserly fretting sort, 
Is the swell with the Pink Umbrella.

I'VE got for you now a 
new sensation, 
It's something that's bound for to take ; 
It's wonders I've lately invented— 
A 
fortune. I'm going to make. 
I've a 
new paten pull-back for ladies ; 
I've something to please all the men, 
I've a 
trick that will make all your money 
You pay out, come right back again. 
I've a 
cradle for rocking the baby, 
And hush it in sweetest of sleep ; 
A 
bell punch that rings all the numbers, 
But nary a 
count will it keep. 
I've a 
gum-drop to put in the mouth, sir, 
It's good for a 
mother-in-law, 
Or a 
man that will talk you to death, sir, 
It's bound for to shut up his jaw. 
I've got for the girls now a 
charmer, 
In shape of a 
dear little rose; 
Whoever will smell it will love you, 
And want right away to propose. 
I've a 
clock that will run without winding, 
And tell you the time of the day ; 
But when you " roll home in the morning," 
It never will give you away.

I've a 
handsome young gallant policeman, 
Who tends to his duties and rounds ; 
And never takes drinks on the corners, 
Or flirts with the " Hoboken Blondes." 
And when the street crossings are crowded, 
To help everybody he must, 
And he always keeps young people waiting, 
And tends to the old ladies first. 
I've a 
president and a 
cashier 
For any position of trust; 
Who'll see that the poor are protected, 
When a 
bank is a 
going to bust. 
I've a 
judge who has a 
compassion, 
A 
gem of a 
mother-in-law, 
Who always will mind her own business, 
When a 
husband and wife are at war. 
I've a 
company now here together, 
Who will do all they call for to please ; 
And cheer you and make you feel happy, 
In the troublesome times like these. 
And I 
as a " Pastor " will ever 
Try to keep you from going astray ; 
In my songs and my sayings I'm singing, 
Of the times and the jokes of the day.

MICHAEL JAMES O'BRIEN . 
THE CURLY HEADED HASHER. 
W ritten by JAS. RICHMOND. 
Sung .by PAT ROONEY. 
Copyrighted, 1879, by CLINTON T. 
DE W ITT. 
AIR.—" Casey's Social Club." 
OF 
a 
fine young man I 
am going to sing, 
His age is two hundred and nine ; 
He is a 
conductor of an ash- cart, 
And his name is Mike O'Brien. 
His feet would measure thirty-four, 
Faith they'd cover up a 
block ; 
The springs of ins pants covers up his shoes, 
And his face would break a 
clock. 
CHORUS. 
For the girls says he is a 
daisy, 
He is the duck of a 
flock of geese ; 
His nose is roaming all over his face, 
And he can waltz on a 
three-cent piece ; 
He beats his way at every ball, 
His shoes are twenty-nine; 
The first man ever wore tight pants, 
Was Michael James O'Brien. 
He looks like the handle of a 
broom, 
Or a 
broken telegraph pole; 
He goes down to Hardly-Able Hall, 
And waltzes for a 
ton of coal ; 
He is always at the matinees, 
To try and catch a 
mash ; 
With his twenty shilling overcoat, 
lie thinks he cuts a 
dash. 
For the girls says, etc. 
His mother raised him up a 
pet, 
He never worked a 
day ; 
He sprinkles balloon juice on his hair, 
And buys his clothes down the bay. 
He'd make a 
good sign for a 
cigar store ; 
With the girls he is No. 1, 
And if you ask him what he works at, 
Faith he'd say he is a 
banker's son. 
For the girls says, etc. 
BANJO SOLO. 
W ritten by ROY LESLIE for BILLY CARTER. 
I'LL sing a 
song of a 
nice young man, 
Who thought himself a 
masher, 
He told the girls he was clerk in a 
bank, 
But the truth he was a 
hasher. 
He would work from sunrise in the morn 
Until his lunch was over, 
Then he'd dress himself up in a 
ten dollar suit, 
And he'd go out on the mash, sir. 
CHORUS. 
He was born in the Fall, 
This man with a 
gall, 
So loud he would bawl 
For hash through the hall. 
He laid over them all 
And he'd run them to the wall ; 
And he never would fall, 
This curly headed hasher. 
One day when the matinee was out, 
He met a 
charming lady ; 
He called her his love and turtle dove, 
And then she called him baby. 
Some time after this to his hotel 
Went this charming lady, 
And she saw her mash a 
slicing his hash, 
On her head he spilt some gravy. 
CHORUS. 
When he saw his mash, 
He dropped with a 
crash 
A 
plate full of hash. 
From her room he did dash, 
As quick as a 
flash; 
He shook his mash 
As quick as a 
flash, 
This curly beaded hasher. 
Written by C. R. DOCKSTADEll, for SHEEHAN and JONES. 
I 
AM a 
man that's great and grand, 
As any in the laud ; 
But then I 
have had a 
sad downfall, 
And the blow I 
cannot stand. 
There's Margaret Jane, my oldest girl, 
She lately ran away, 
She's gone to sing wid Brignolia, 
She's the queen of the Open-a. 
CHORUS. 
She can sing in the key of 43, 
She's a 
voice like a 
young bluejay ; 
She's great and grand as any in the land--
Now she's gone to the open-a. 
Oh, I 
thought to take her back with me, 
To the spot where I 
was born ; 
For to wed a 
prince or an Irish duke, 
But she laughed at me with scorn. 
She calls me old Galley, go stab his nibs, 
Tells me go hire a 
dray ; 
Pull down me chin, wipe off me vest, 
And come to the open- a. 
She can sing, etc.

Darling Bessie of the Lea." 
On, I 
wander 'mid the roses, in the golden summer time, 
And listen to the streamlet while it rings a 
merry chime ; 
But far sweeter than the roses or the streamlet unto me, 
The sunbright face of  
"My Mary Ann." 
Oh, my Mary Ann, she's an artizan 
In a 
factory way down town ; 
She makes umbrellas for the high-toned fellers, 
And she lives six stories from the ground, 
In a 
brick tenement, where they cut up devilment 
Every night in the week and ever day._ 
My sweet Mary Ann walks out upon the sand  
"Belle Brandon." 
'Neath a 
free by the margin of a 
woodland, 
Whose spreading leafy boughs sweep the ground, 
With a 
path leading thither o'er the prairie, 
Where silence hung her night garb around,— 
There oft I 
have wandered in the evening, 
When the summer winds were fragrant on the lea, 
There  
I 
Cannot Sing the Old Songs." 
I 
cannot sing the old songs 
I 
sung long years ago, 
For heart and voice would fail me, 
And foolish tears would flow. 
For bygone hours come o'er my heart, 
With each familiar strain ; 
I 
cannot sing— 
This Wheat By-and-bye." 
We're a 
band that's as green as grass, 
And by day you can see us—not far; 
And the farmers await us to pass, . 
To prepare us a 
grave over thar !

In this wheat by-and-bye, 
We shall meet in this beautiful field 
In this wheat by-and-bye,

" 
Vive La Bacchanal." 
Old King Bacchus on his throne, 
He drinks a 
health to all men ; 
Sparkling champagne is his own, 
Cigars and cognac. 
He bids you all to " taste him small," 
Or he will surely floor you ; 
So don't disgrace the wine-red face, 
Of the glorious god of wine. 
CHORUS. 
Then here's a 
health, now fill your glasses, 
Here a 
health to Bacchanal ! 
Corks fly bang ! Bacchanal ! Bacchanal ! 
Here's a 
health to  
"Nancy Fat.' 
Oh, Nancy Fat, she was a 
gal 
Fair and tall and slender; 
The fairest gal I 
ever saw 
In all the female gender. 
A 
lovely foot I 
know she had, 
Into a 
boot to thrust; 
Her ankles small were made for use 
To keep away the dust.

MEDLEY,—Concluded. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, Nancy Fat, what are you at ? 
I 
love you as no other; 
Oh, Nancy Fat  
" 
Thou hast Wounded the Spirit." 
Thou hast wounded the spirit that loved thee, 
And cherished thine image for years ; 
Thou hast taught me at last to forget thee, 
In secret, in silence and tears. 
As a 
young bird, when left by its mother  
She hugged me and she kissed me, 
She took me by the hand, 
She said I 
was the sweetest thing 
In the shape of mortal man. 
I 
told her that I 
loved her, 
My love was good and strong; 
I 
asked her if she'd marry me,— 
She told me to go 'long. 
CHORUS. 
Come and kiss me, 
Come and kiss me, 
Come and kiss me, Susie, 
Don't be mad wid me! 
Susie, if you say de word 
Why, married we will be; 
Come and kiss me, 
Come and kiss me, 
Come and kiss me, Susie, 
And don't be m.ad wid me!

HEBREW POLITICIANS. 
Written by D AVE H O 
WARD, and sung with great success by How-
ARD and TnomPsoN at the Windsor Theatre. 
HERE we are two Hebrew politicians, 
When we run for office we got terrible opposition 
From every creed that is known in existence, 
We are the Hebrew politicians of the day, 
When election time does come, lots of promises we do 
make ; 
You should see them Hebrew: voters how our money they 
do take, 
To go and cast their ballots, 'cause they know we take 
the cake. 
We're the Hebrew politicians of the day, 
Cliont7s. 
When we go out we dress up nice and neat. 
We eat a 
piece of garlic., to make our breath smell sweet ; 
And the gang upon the corner holler, ' Sheeneys, float 
your feet," 
We're the Hebrew politicians of the day. 
We are going to rim for Alderman upon the next election ; 
Cast your eyes upon us—do you think we'll pass inspec-
tion ? 
And if you want to vote for us, we won't have no objec-
tion. 
We're the Hebrew politicians of the day. 
And when we are elected we will do the best we can, 
We'll give a 
good day's wages to every working man 
And the people all will say, " For them Sheeneys 
hurrah ! 
They're the Hebrew politicians of tho day." 
When we go out, etc.

BIDDY THE BALLET GIRL. 
• 
Written by J. BRADLEY, and sung with great success by JACK CONROY, 
every evening, at GILL's, 15 West Houston street. 
I 
AM a 
gay laboring man, 
And I 
have a 
beautiful daughter, 
Who never did care much for work, 
It's her mother's own wish that she aughter ; 
It seems that she fancied the stage, 
So I 
granted her final request, 
And now she's a 
beautiful dancer, 
And ranks along with the best. 
CHORUS. 
On the stage she is Madame La Shortie, 
But her right name is Biddy McCarty ; 
She brings home at night, and at matinees, 
Large baskets of flowers, and also bouquets. 
Oh, she is my only daughter, 
And I 
am the man that taught her 
To wear spangled clothes, and go round on her toes, 
And there is no such a 
girl as Biddy. 
When salary day does arrive, 
All trouble and toil it does smother, 
For, just the day before that there was a 
kick, 
The girl had been scolded by her mother ; 
She's courting a 
clerk in the bank, 
Who sees her safe home at the door, 
And pays a 
big gang in the gallery, 
To applaud in a 
perfect uproar. 
On the stage, etc. 
Last Saturday night I 
got paid ; 
I 
thought I 
would go to the theatre, 
And take the old woman along ; 
In the parquette in front I 
did seat her. 
When Biddy came out for to dance, 
My son Danny was up in the tier ; 
He cried, " Go in, sister Biddy," 
When they bounced him right out on his car. 
On the stage, etc.

YOU CAN DO IT WITH PLENTY OF NERVE. 
As sung by America's Own Vocalist, TONY PASTOR. 
How often, my friends, some poor wretched man, 
Of life's ups and downs will complain, 
He'll tell you he's struggling as hard as he can, 
A 
fair honest living to gain. 
To every one here now, a 
maxim I'll say, 
In fighting life's battles ' twill serve 
To banish misfortune and trouble away, 
You can do it with plenty of nerve. 
CHORUS. 
You can do it, my boys, with plenty of nerve, 
No matter how hard ' tis to do, 
There's nothing ' tis true, but what you'll wade thro' 
If you've only got plenty of nerve. 
There's a 
young man I 
see each day on the street, 
You'd think him a 
millionaire's son, 
He's dressed like a 
prince from his head to his feet, 
His life seems all sunshine and fun. 
But I'll tell you the truth, this chap is ‘• dead broke," 
Not a 
nickel he holds in reserve, 
Yet he lives, you will find, on honey and wine, 
Because he has got a 
great nerve. 
You can do it, etc. 
57 
YOU CAN DO IT WITH PLENTY OF NERVE. 
Concluded. 
A beautiful blonde rides out every day, 
Of all the attention she gains, • 
With gold mounted harness and shining " coupe " 
Life's pleasures she surely obtains. 
Now this woman, my boys, but a 
few years ago, 
For a 
rich man as house girl did serve, 
But " great oaks," you know, " from small acorns will 
grow " 
If the corn has got a 
great nerve. 
You can do it, etc. 
Now all who pass by this sentiment true, 
A 
failure in life they deserve ; 
Think of the old woman who lived in a 
shoe, 
She must have had plenty of nerve. 
That I've tried hard .o 
please, I 
know you'll agree, 
Yet there's something I've kept in reserve, 
There's a 
girl here that's a 
blushing and winking at me, 
But she can do it with plenty of nerve. 
You can do it, etc. 
Then remember, my friends, as you journey along, 
That life's longest lane has a 
curve ; 
The reason that now I 
am singing this song, 
Is because I've got plenty of nerve. 
But the words they are true not idle and vain, 
And your applause I 
will strive to deserve ; 
Rut after singing so long if you call me again, 
You must have a 
terrible nerve.

IRELAND'S SHORE. 
Composed by JOE A . 
B URGESS, and sung with immense ,success by 
Miss ANNIE BURGESS. 
IN 
a 
little cottage neatly built 
Upon old Ireland's shore, 
Where the shamrock and the thistle grows so free, 
Lives a 
colleen dear so sweet and fair. 
Upon that Isle so green, 
And her dear face now I 
often long to see. 
CHORUS. 
But she's far away from me across the deep blue sea, 
Could I 
but see her bright sweet face once more, 
And when we met as strangers, 
Then I 
vowed we'd meet again ; 
She's my darling treasure, 
Pride of Ireland's shore. 
Oh, my love for her has grown stronger 
Since we met on Erin's ghore, 
And I 
long to see the land \\Item I 
was born, 
And to tell the love that I 
have cherished 
All those years for her, 
And to hear her kind heart's answer in return. 
But she's far away, etc. 
I 
have seen the Isle so green, 
I've gained my fair colleen, 
Her love so pure is mine forevermore, 
And when we met as strangers 
Then I 
vowed we'd meet again ; 
I've my darling treasure, pride of Ireland's shore.

Biliousness, 
Congestion of the Liver, cerebral Congestion and Giddi-

They arouse the sluggish currents of the blood, 
and awake to healthy and harmonious action every 
function of the body; they render clear and bright the 
sallow skin and lack- lustre eye, renovating and renewing 
the entire system, removing and averting the many 
diseases which the disordered 
liver 
provokes and 
produces. 
In malarial districts, where biliousness is 
most prevalent and most to be dreaded, "M ERLIN'S 
HEALTH GRANULES" will prove a great saving of 
health and money as their timely use will avert attacks 
of Bilious Fever and Malarial Fever, and will so fortify 
the system that it will 
be 
unaffected by malarial 
influence.

MALARI A L FEVER . 
However doe irs may differ as to the exact cause of this 
fearful disease, they all agree upon one thing, that poisonous 
atoms have found their way into the system. 
Common sense 
tells us that the way to cure this disease is to expel these 
poisonous atoms. 
This is effectually done by a 
free use of 
Meriin's Health Granules. Not only do they cleanse 
the bowels of the perilous stuff that to retain is fatal, but they 
restore the blood to activity, and make it pay frequent visits to 
the lungs, where it becomes aerated and full of health. This is 
purifying at the fountain head. 
Where the source is clean the 
stream cannot be foul. 
Good health and chills and fever of 
course cannot exist together. 
THE GOUT CAN BE RELIEVED, 
if not entirely banished from the system, by using Merlin's 
Health Granule:4 at the first intimation of an approach-
ing attack. 
The Granules. prevent the formation of the 
chalky deposits ' fich, if allowed to become at all fixed, ren-
der the joints stiff, and make them work with difficulty. 
The 
Granules have exactly the same effect upon the joints that 
grease has upon axles and wheels— lubricates the grating 
parts, then the joints work smooth and easy and without any 
pain. 
Try Merlin's Health Granules occasionally if 
you want to bid defiance to that old hereditary foe, the Gout. 
nAKIEFULNESS AND SOMxAmuULISM, 
though so different in many of their features, are children of 
the same parents— Indigestion and Torpidity of Blood. 
Both 
of these complaints can be cured in the same way, simply by 
producing a 
healthy, natural digestion. 
It is no use trying 
local remedies. 
You may swathe and bathe and bandage the 
head till you are tired. 
It will not alter the condition of the 
blood. 
You might as well expect to make a 
house healthy by 
whitewashing the outside and cleaning the windows while the 
cellar was reeking with sewer gas. No ! the blood must be puri-
fied, or disease will ride rampant. 
Use Merlin's Health 
Granules and Wakefulness will subside into calm slumber, 
and the open-eyed sleep- walker will remain with his eyes closed 
upon the unruffled pillow.

TIIEIR USE CONDUCES TO 
For those 
diseases 
attendant upon a 
disordered condition of the digestive and 
excretive functions, " M ERLIN'S H 
EA LT II 
GRANULES" afford a 
certain, innocent and 
agreeable remedy. 
Their constant and 
judicious use will cure DysAbsia in its variolis 
and distressing forms, Adis-es/ion, _Flalulcncy, 
Hji_pochondria, Loss of Appaile, Low Spirils, 
Loss of Memory and Slce.plessness, Habitual 
Constipation and its natural consequences. 
The Piles may be controlled and cured by 
the use of the " 
H EALTH GRANULES." 
DON 'T WAIT TILL TO -MORROW 
If you feel any symptoms of Jaundice or other complaints be-
ginning in a 
non- acting Liver. 
The bile is stopped, and not 
doing its duty. 
Soon follow torpidity, congestion, mot.- 
lineation, DEATH. Take at once a 
full dose of Mer-
lin's Htqa.lth Granules. That will stop the disease. 
NERVOUS DEBILITY 
Is the curse of civilization. 
Luckily it can be cured. 
It pro-
ceeds from intense m-mtal strain ; from violating physical laws, 
throwing the reins on the neck of Passion. The body becomes 
impaired, the mind follows suit, then the weak body and the 
irresolute mind plague each other, and drive the poor wretch 
to mental imbecility ; but, as we have said, Nervous Debility 
can be cured ; the diseased humors can be driven from the 
blood ; the stomach becomes strong and acte, the heart 
bounds to its work, the mind follows suit, black despair flies, 
health returns, not by any miracle, but simply by using the 
great remedy, Merlin's Health Granules. One box 
has been known to bring a 
poor wretch from the edge of the 
grave. 
Do your bones ache '? 
You are either filled with Malarial 
Poison or there lingers in your system the dire effects of an-
cestral indiscretions and the Mercurial Ponions never driven 
out. 
But do not despair. 
By judiciously using the never-
failing remedy, Merlin's Health Granules, the poison-
ous atoms are expelled to give place to pure, strength- giving 
blood. 
THE PRESENT fly 
is the time to try and get well. 
The ounce of prevention is 
the thing. 
Don't wait till you have to get the pound of cure. 
Stop the first small leak. 
Don't wait till the ship is water-
logged. 
Disease is absolutely prev;2litzd by using Men.

“ COME AND LET US REASON TOGETHER.” 
It has been well said that he that cannot reason is a 
fool ; be 
that dare not reason is a 
slave ; he that will not reason is a 
bigot. 
We do not believe, good reader, that you belong to either of 
these three classes, and therefore address ourselves _ to you. 
You will have noticed that every Doctor, .after feeling the 
pulse, looking at the tongue, and ascertaining the temperature 
of the body, pauses for a 
moment's thought. 
Then he quickly 
" 
Are your bowels regular ? " 
This you will therefore 
notice is 
the very key-note by which he seeks to know 
whether you are healthy or diseased. 
By further questions in 
the same direction he learns the particular nature of the dis-
ease. 
But no odds how many different points he may wander 
to, lac soon reiurns to the digestive organs. 
The disease may lie most apparent in the lung-s, the kidneys, 
the heart, the liver, the head; but it is always the bowels he 
treats as the salient point of disease that has to be first treated, 
hence the first medicine prescribed is a 
dose to act upon the 
organs of digestion. 
This is wisdom. 
The doctor knows that 
xvhhout thorough dfigestion half the food taken 
it 
worse than useless. 
As certain things ; trewn around become 
incorporated with the soil and nourish it ( left in a 
compact 
heap they breed disease), so without an active digestion food is 
hurtful. 
These are truths that no sane man will attempt to 
gainsay. 
What is the remedy ? 
Surely a 
medicine powerful 
enough to carry off all injurious matter, and at the same time 
having such balsamic qualities as will heal any inflammations 
that may have arisen in the lining of the different duets. 
Now 
the very best thing that can be used to do what all doctois 
recommend is 11Z2rilin's Health Granules. 
Pleasant 
to take, easy in operation, and leaving lasting good effects after 
thei- use. 
This is homely, sound doctrine. 
Try, and be con-
v'eed. 
Merlin's Illea2th Granules do not compete 
other aperient medicine; they simply' extinguish 
them. 
don't fight with a penny dip, it merely out-
shines it.
