CIIAMPAG1N-E CHARLEY 
SONGSTER). 
CHAMPAGNE CHARLEY. 
SOME time ago I 
had a 
beau, 
And Charley was his name, 
A smart young fellow, fond of show, 
Who wished my hand to claim; 
But from my feet I 
spurned this swell, 
As I 
will now explain, 
Although he loved me very well, 
He better loved champagne. 
Chorus. 
Champagne Charley was his name, 
Champagne Charley was his name; 
Always kicking up a 
frightful noise, 
Always kicking up a 
frightful noise. 
Champagne Charley was his name, 
Champagne Charley was his name; 
Kicking up a 
row at night, boys, 
Always ready for a 
spree. 
One moment still he couldn't rest, 
He passed whole nights and days

BROTHER'S WANTING AT THE DOOR. 
In drinking Madame Clicquot's best, 
And smoking Henry Clay's, 
And then when home to bed he'd go, 
With wild disordered brain, 
He'd lay it to his studies, 
• Though I 
know it was champagne. 
Champagne Charley, etc. 
His cash did quickly disappear; 
Which did not well suit me ; 
For champagne's dear—had he drank beer, 
Things different now had been, 
I 
might have been his slave for life, 
But now 'tis all in vain, 
For how can he require a 
wife 
When wedded to champagne 7 
Champagne Charley, etc. 
BROLHEit'S WANTING AT THE DOOR 
A PARODY. 
As sung by GEO. BROOKES. 
AIR—" Brother's Fainting at the Door." 
YONDER comes a 
big Policeman, 
One I'm sure I've seen before, 
With his shield upon his bosom, 
Glittering bright as golden ore. 
Look! my eyes cannot deceive me; 
The street lie now is crossing o'er, 
Now his club he's firmly grasping, 
For Brother's wanting at the door. 
Chore us. 
Some one run and tell my brother, 
He's up on the second floor; - 
Press him quickly to skedaddle, 
The big Policeman's at the door. 
A SONG OF CONUNDRUMS. 
Prithee, tell us big Policeman, 
And do not let us ask in vain, 
Why you want to take our brother 
Before the magistrate again 7 
For a 
week- he has been sober, 
And all his drunken sprees gave o'er; 
He hasn't been clyfaking lately, 
Or hain't broke into any store. 
Chore us again—Some one, etc. 
No, 'tis not for that I 
want him, 
But why he was forced to fly, 
He has been a-bounty jumping, 
And then skedaddled on the sly; 
Now you bet I'm bound to have him 
Before another day is o'er, 
And be sure we'll quickly place him 
Where he'll bounty jump no more. 
Chore us once more—Some one, etc. 
A SONG OF CONUNDRUMS. 
As Sung by GEO. BROOKES in " Three Fast Men." 
I'VE been teasing my brains just to search out a 
few 
Fresh Conundrums, in hopes that my 
jokes will please you; 
The joy of my heart's centred in that great cause— 
The height of my wishes to gain your applause—. 
A subject I'll never give up. 
A good haunch o' venison's a 
very fine thing", 
I've been told by some chaps it's a 
dish for a 
king. 
Why is a 
fat haunch like a 
tight-lacing dandy 1 
I 
hope you've an answer to this pat and handy, 
And don't till you try give it up. 
Spoken.—Why is a 
haunch of venison like a 
dandy? Be-
cause he's a 
bit of a 
buck. 
12 
A SONG or CONUNDRUMS. 
Eddication alone fits a 
man for this life, 
And what we ought all to look for in a 
wife; 
It's want is of discord too often the root. 
Now why is an ignorant man like a 
boot '1 
But don't till you try give it up._ 
Spoken.—Why is an ignorant man like a 
dirty boot 'I 
Because he wants polishing. 
The next that I 
ask I'm afraid you will guess, 
Although it's a 
good one you all will confess : 
Pray, why is the grass that grows in our fields 
Like the poor little mouse that our bread and cheese steals I 
Now don't till you try give it up. • 
Spoken.—Why is grass like a mouse'? Because the 
cat'll eat it. 
Now suppose an ol(1 woman for fancy should go 
Upon the salt sea for a 
sail or a 
row, 
And the boat should upset, and should leave the old girl 
Exposed to the waves, to their foam and their twirl, 
Pray, what d'ye think she is like 1 
Spoken.—What is an old woman in the sea like 1 Like 
to be drowned. 
When the beasts two and two all walked into the ark, 
Which went first or last we are left in the dark; 
its supposed that the elephant went in the last; 
Pray, why did he do so is the question that's asked? 
Now don't till you try give it up. 
Spoken.—Why was the elephant the last beast that went 
into the ark 1 Because it took him some time to pack up 
his trunk. 
I've now got another I 
think you'll approve, 
The gout is a 
pain that we none of us love; 
Pray, why is a 
swell'd and a 
bad gouty leg 
Like the sash in the window'? 
Your answer I 
beg, 
And don't till you try give it up. 
Spoken.—Why is a 
gouty leg like a 
window? 
Because 
its full of panes. 
DRINK TO ME ONLY. 
13 
I've just got a 
little one left to the last, 
A bandy-legged man we know cannot run fast; 
Now why is a 
man that has two bandy legs, 
Like a 
poor wounded fellow that charity begs 7 
But don't till you try give it up. 
Spoken.---Why is a 
bandy-legged man like a 
beggar 7 
Because he's in-kneed. 
DRINK TO ME ONLY. 
BY BEN JONSON. 
DRINK to DIC only with thine eyes, 
And I 
will pledge with mine ; 
But leave a 
kiss within the cup, 
And 
not ask for wine. 
Drink to me, etc. 
The thirst that from the soul (loth rise, 
Requires a 
drink divine ; 
But might I 
of Jove's nectar sip, 
I 
would eXchange for thine. 
Drink to me, etc. 
I 
sent thee late a 
roseate wreath, 
Not so much honoring thee, 
As giving it a 
hope that there 
It might not withered be. 
Drink to me, etc. 
But thou thereon did'st only breathe, 
And sent it back to me ; 
Since when it blooms and smells, I 
swear, 
Not of itself, but thee. 
Drink to me, etc. 
14 
A MOTLEY MEDLEY. 
Then take my hand, ' tis all I 
have, 
My heart was thine before ; 
Love me as well as I 
love thee, 
And I'll not ask for more. 
Drink to me, etc. 
A MOTLEY MEDLEY. 
As sung by TONY PASTOR. 
AIR—" Be a 
Brick." 
THE moon was shining silver bright ; 
All bloodless lay th' untrodden snow, 
When freedom from her mountain height 
Exclaimed, " Now don't be foolish, Joe." 
An hour passed and the Turk awoke, 
A bumble bee went thundering by, 
To hover in the Sulphur smoke, 
Dear mother, I've come home to die, 
Tiddy fol, etc. 
His echoing axe the woodman swings, 
lie was a 
lad of high renown, 
And deep the pearly caves among, 
Giles Scrocr4r,ins courted Molly Brown. 
Loud roars the wild, inconstant blast 
On old Long Island's sea-girts shore, 
When twilight dews are falling fast, 
And brother's fainting at the door. 
Tiddy fol, etc. 
Oh ever thus in childhood's hour, 
By torch and trumpet fast arrayed, 
Beneath yon ivy- mantled tower 
The bullfrog croaks his serenade ; 
WHEN I 
WENT OUT A- DRINKING. 
15 
My love is like the red, red rose, 
He bought a 
ring with posey true, 
Sir Barney Bodkin broke his nose, 
And Saxon, I 
am Roderick Dhu. 
Tiddy fol, etc. 
WHEN I 
WENT OUT A-DRINKING. 
Written and sung by TONY PASTOR. 
Ant—" Man and Money Ready." 
SUPPRESS your smiles and tears, 
And listen to my ditty, 
If I'm not old in years, 
I'm old in iniquity ; 
My father turned me out— 
Hard- hearted deed I'm thinking, 
IIe temperance did spoilt, 
While I 
went out a-drinking. 
Too ral loo, etc. 
I 
soon got so depraved 
I'd stay out all night dodging, 
I 
thought by that to save 
The expenses of my lodging; 
In a 
hall one night I 
lay, 
Some fellow in came slinking, 
And stole my change away, 
When I 
was out a- drinking. 
Too ral loo, etc. 
Two friends I 
chanced to meet, 
I 
asked them for to treat, 
One called me a 
dead-beat, 
And then me began to beat; 
16 
WREN Y 
WENT OUT A-DRINKING. 
I 
challenged him to box, 
Pulled off my clothes like winking, 
But some fellow hooked them off, 
When I 
was out a-drinking. 
Too ral loo, etc. 
I 
said it wasn't fair 
To leave me standing naked, 
When a 
looker-on says, " Here, 
Iii stand a 
treat—come take it." 
I 
got a 
horn of gin, 
I 
drank it without blinking, 
But my friend stepped out. 
again 
While I 
stood there a- drinking. 
Too ral loo, etc. 
When I 
couldn't pay the score 
The waiter boxed and tripped me, 
Then just out from the door 
The landlord well horse-whipped me 
From him I 
got a 
kick, 
I 
on the floor was sinking, 
Since that I 
can't walk quick 
When I 
go out a-drinking. 
Too ral loo, etc. 
A 
policeman came along, 
All sorts of names he called me ; 
He said I 
acted wrong, 
And to the tombs he hauled me ; 
The judge looked black, says he, 
" 
We'll settle you, I'm thinking," 
So six months he gave me 
For going out a-drinking. 
Too ral loo, etc. 
TUE WHITE-ROUSE RECEPTION. 
17 
THE WHITE-HOUSE RECEPTION. 
PAT'S LETTER FROM WASHINGTON. 
An original song as sung by GEO. BnooKEs. 
Ain—" The New Policeman." 
OH 
Molly Machree, you didn't see 
The White- House party's grand reception ; 
You'll bear it every word from me, 
And that without the least deception; 
It was a 
mighty grand affair, 
The members all got invitations, • 
And wasn't I 
myself just there 
As Miles O'Reilly's blood relation. 
Chorus. 
Molly, my dear, did ye ever hear 
Of the illigant wake of Tim McCarty ? 
Well, 'twas nothing at all that could compare 
With Mrs. Lincoln's White- House party. 
What lots of ladies courtesied in, 
And gintlemin so free and aisy, 
And officers and soger min, 
From Giniral Grant to Corporal Casey, 
Politicians by the score, 
With shoddy contractors pretty freely, 
The Governor Seymour on the floor, 
With Stephen Branch and Horace Greeley. 
Molly, my dear, etc. 
There was no lack, you may be sure, 
Of writers and of rhetoricians, 
And army sutlers, rich and poor, 
Were arm in arm with politicians ; 
Pernandy Wood and Gideon Welles, 
With Lucy Stone came in so slyly, 
While in amongst the beaux and belles 
Was Harriet Stowe and Miles O'Reilly. 
Molly, my dear, etc. 
OH MANY A TIME I AM SAD AT 
HEART.

18 
THE WHITE-HOUSE RECEPTION . 
There were foreign Counts of no account, 
From foreign parts and parts adjacent, 
With an Indian tribe dressed up in paint, 
But their want of clothes was quite unda,cent-; 
There- was Barnum with his giants too, 
And Bennett that wants to go to France, sir, 
Matilda heron, Dan Bryant, and who 
Was with him but Cubas, the illig-ant dancer. 
Molly, my dear, etc. 
They'd coffee, chocolate, and tay, 
And cakes that flew around like winking, 
Before or since that blessed day 
I 
never saw such eating or drinking. 
They'd pumpkin pies and puddings likewise; 
We walked into the pastries after 
We'd Irish whiskey and lager beer, 
With sarsyparrilly and soda water. 
Molly, my dear, etc. 
Miss Dickenson got the Tribune, 
And for the party read a 
chapter, 
Then Abram told some funny jokes, 
Till all the folks near burst with laughter; 
I 
was in hopes they'd raise a 
row, 
And have some fun before we parted; 
To get up a 
fight they didn't know how, 
sure ' twas myself that longed to start it. 
Molly, my dear, etc. 
Then Giniral Halleck sung a 
song, 
And all the ladies chorused highly, 
It wasn't as good, nor half as long, 
As the ballad of " Wake up William Reilly." 
Myself then danced an Irish jig, 
Which made ould Abram laugh so hearty, 
lie trated me till, drunk as a 
pig, 
I 
staggered home from the White-House party, 
Molly, my dear, etc. 
e 
A QUAKER IN LOVE. 
A s 
sung by GEO. BROOKES in " Wild Oats." 
YEA, I 
fell in the fit of love, 
With a 
ti turn ti, 
The spirit then began to move, 
With a 
ti turn ti, 
Quoth I, fair maiden ne'er deride, 
For verily when thou'rt my bride 
Lo ! I 
will cleave unto thy side, 
With a 
ti turn ti. 
Behold, said Ruth, there is a 
grove 
ti turn ti, 
Where birds called turtles coo and love, 
With a 
ti turn ti, 
Lo! then I 
thought her truly mine, 
But when of love she gave this sign 
She proved a 
cruel Phillis-tine, 
With a 
ti turn ti. 
For she another suitor had, 
With a 
ti turn ti, 
Profanely called a 
flashy lad, 
With a 
ti turn 
And when I 
reached the grove assigned, 
lie came before I 
Ruth could find, 
And kicked me ruth-lessly behind, 
With a 
toe turn ti. 
OH MANY A TIME I 
AM SAD AT HEART. 
(MAGGIE'S SECRET.) 
Music published by C. M. 
TREMAINE, 481 Broadway. 
On many a 
time I 
am sad at heart; 
And I 
hav'n't a 
word to say, 
20 
FIVE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING. 
And I 
keep from the lasses and lads apart, 
In the meadows a-making hay ; 
But Willie will bring me the first wild rose, 
In my new sun-bonnet to wear, 
And Robin will wait at the keeper's gate, 
For he follows me ev'ry where. 
But I 
tell them they needn't come wooing to me, 
For my heart, my heart is over the sea. 
Two summer's ago when a 
brave ship sailed 
Far away to the golden west, 
0 
nobody knew that my heart went too, 
For the secret I 
ne'er conf...ssed, 
A mother took leave of Her boy that day, 
I 
could'hear her sob and cry, 
As I 
followed her back to her dreary house, 
But never a 
word said I. 
So you see that they needn't, etc. 
I 
sat by his mother one midsummer day, 
And she look'd me through and through, 
As she spoke of her lad who was far away, 
For she guess'd that I 
loved him too ; 
She turned to me fondly and whispered low, 
I 
was worthy her sailor boy. 
My foolish tears, they began to flow, 
Though my heart beat high for joy. 
So you see that they needn't, etc. 
YiVE O'CLOCK IN au, MORNING. 
Music published by C. M. TREISIAINE, 481 Broadway, N. Y. 
THE dew lay glittering o'er the grass, 
A 
mist hung over the brook, 
At the' earliest beam of the golden sun 
The swallow her nest forsook ; 
PEG BRIGGS AND HER PIGS. 
21 
The snowy blooms of the hawthorne tree 
Lay thickly the ground adorning, 
The birds were singing in ev'ry bush 
At five o'clock in the morning. 
Repeat. 
And Bessie the milkmaid merrily sang, 
The meadows were fresh and fair, 
And the breeze of morning kiss'd her brow, 
And played with her nut-brown hair ; 
But, oft she turned and looked around, 
As if the silence scorning, 
'Twas time for the mower to whet his scythe, 
At five o'clock in the morning. 
Repeat. 
And over the meadows the mowers came, 
And merry their voices rang, 
And one among them wended his way 
To where the milk-maid sang; 
And as he linger'd by her side, 
Despite his comrades' warning, 
The old, old story was told again, 
At five o'clock in the morning. 
Repeat. 
PEG BRIGGS AND TIER PIGS. 
As sung by GEO. BROOEFA in " The King's Gardener." 
Ain—" The Athlone Landlady." 
A QUEER little woman, Peg. Briggs, • 
Had a 
parcel of very fine pigs, 
And a 
barber hard by 
Threw at Peg a 
sheep's eye, 
Or rather ' twas thrown at her pigs, 
So courting he went to Peg Briggs. 
22 
BROOKES' MEDLEY. 
" 
My dear little creature, Peg Briggs," 
Said the shaver and weaver of wigs, 
" 
You're as sweet as can be." 
" 
You don't say so," says she, 
Though more ugly than one of her pigs 
Was that beautiful beauty, Peg Briggs. 
He gained the red hand of Peg Briggs, 
And treated her worse than her pigs, 
And at market, we're told, 
One morning he sold 
To a 
dealer in pork all her pigs, • 
And lumped in the bargain Peg Briggs. 
Oh pity the fate of Peg Briggs, 
Ye maidens who've got little pigs, 
And when lovers sigh 
Have an eye to the stye, 
And don't let him marry your pigs, 
Lest spare ribs you prove, like Peg Briggs. 
BROOKES' MEDLEY. 
As sung by GEO. BROOKES in " Life in Town." 
AIR—" Meet me in the Willow Glen." 
M EET me in the willow glen, 
Where the silvery moon is beaming; 
Songs of love I'll sing thee then, 
When all the world is— 
AIR—" Paddy Carey." 
—at the fair of Nate Clogheen, 
Where Sargeant Snap met Paddy Carey, 
A 
finer boy was never seen, 
As light as— 
Ant—" I'd be a 
Butterfly." 
—a butterfly, 
BROOKES' MEDLEY. 
Born in a 
bower, 
Where roses and lilies and— 
Am—" Mynheer Vandunek." 
—brandy and water gaily, 
And he quenched his thirst with two quarts of the first 
To a 
pint of the latter daily, 
Singing, Oh that a 
Dutchman's draught could be as deep 
as— 
Ant—" The Sea." 
The sea, the sea, the open sea, 
The blue, the fresh, the ever free, 
Without a 
mark, without a 
bound 
It runneth— 
AIR—" All around my Hat." 
All around my hat I 
wears a 
green willow, 
All around my hat for a

CHARLOTTE, my darling, the dinner is Waiting, 
The voice of the waiter is heard on the stairs, 
The guests on their bosom their napkins are piimirrg, 
Charlotte, my darling, why lingering there, 
Oh hast thou forgotten how early was breakfast 
Oh hast thou forgotten how late shall be tea 7 
We may be too late and we shall not get any, 
Charlotte my darling have pity on me. 
Charlotte, my darling, come down from your toilet, 
The fair capons gleam in the jelly's mild light, 
Oh where is the spell that once lay in plum pudding 1 
Conic down as you are or I 
shan't get a

Charlotte, my Charlotte, my faint voice is calling, 
Ere long will be vanished both pudding and tart, 
I

Oh why dost thou loiter when they must depart'? 
I

Oh why didst thou loiter thou loved of my heart'?

'TWAS a 
pleasant summer's morning, 
Just the day I 
like t' enjoy, 
When I 
woke and look'd out early 
Puzzled how my time t' employ ; 
In such fine and splendid weather, 
I 
don't care for work, do you? 
So I 
went to see my sweetheart, 
As I'd nothing else to do. 
Off I 
started through the meadows, 
Where the dew- beds pearl'd the spray, 
And responsive to the song birds, 
I 
kept singing all the way; 
Quite surprised she was to see me 
Come so early there to woo, 
Till I 
said I'd just walked over 
'Cause I'd nothing else to do. 
Then we rambled forth together, 
Down the lane beneath the trees, 
While so gently stirred the shadows 
Of their branches in the breeze; 
26 
THERE 'S NOTHING LIKE RAISING THE WIND . 
And whene'er our conversation 
Languished for a 
word or two, 
Why, of course I 
kindly kissed her, 
As I'd nothing else to do. 
But before the day was over, 
I'd somehow made up my mind . 
That I'd pop the question to her, 
If to me her heart inclined; 
So I 
whispered sweet, " My darling, 
Will you have me, Yes, or No 1" 
"Well," said she, " perhaps I 
may, my dear, 
When I've nothing else to do." 
THERE'S NOTHING LITZTI RAISING 'nu, WIND. 
A s 
sung by TONY PASTOR. 
On I 
am a 
jolly old cobbler, and that you can tell by my 
face, 
My wife is a 
noisy old squabbler because I've been strip-
ping the place; 
I've been on the fuddle a 
week now, and mean to be on a 
week more, 
And if she gives me any cheek now, why sprawling shell 
go on the floor. 
Chorus. 
Hurra for a 
pot and a 
bottle, 
Hurra for a 
drop on the sly, 
There's nothing like wetting your throttle, 
And drink like a 
cock till you die. 
I 
sold the old tub and table, likewise the old mop and the 
pail, 
And this very night, if I'm able, I'll 'sell the old bed with-
out fail; 
THERE 'S NOTHING LIKE RAISING TIIE WIND , 
27 
I 
pawned all the boots I 
was making, and I 
feel very sor-
ry for that, 
For a 
drop of gin I 
am shaking, who'll give me three 
cents for my hat 7 
Hurra for a 
pot, etc. 
I 
left all my tools for a 
quarter, for ' bacca and beer I 
must 
say, 
From my landlord I'm sure of a 
drilling, I 
spent all the 
rent t'other day, 
I 
sold the old broom for my toddy, and the tin that we 
kept for the cat, 
And next morning to warm my body I 
hooked it away 
with the mat. 
Hurra for a 
pot, etc. 
My wife she is always a- crying, but I 
say there's no use 
in that, 
And you'll never catch me a-sighing—that's how it is I 
am so fat; 
For a 
glass of beer now I 
am dancing, so who's going to 
stand the next treat '? 
Mind now the words I'm advancing, who'll buy these old 
boots off my feet 7 
Hurra for a 
pot, etc. 
I 
sold the teapot and the kettle, the nightcap that goes 
on my head, 
And likewise I 
sold for some metal, the blanket we had 
on the bed, 
Now who's going to lend me a 
shilling 1—don't all be too 
ready to speak '•  
TO leave this ere choker I'm willing—I'll come and release 
it next week. 
Hurra for a 
pot, etc. 
Like a 
fish I'm given to drinking, for a 
drop now I 
surely 
shall die, 
I'm too' funny by half I 
am thinking, you'll own that my 
humor is dry; 
A FIGHT BY MISTAK E. 
I'll go home and sell the old pillows, and then all my 
room will be thinned, 
Never mind what the old women tell us, there's nothing 
like raising the wind.

A FIGHT BY MISTAKE. 
As sung by GEO. Bnomcs. 
Ant--" Darby Kelly, Oh!" 
ONE morning bright before ' twas lighf, 
I 
set off for sweet Derry, oh! 
All spruce and gay at the fair to play, 
Drink, dance and fight so merry, oh! 
I 
trudged along and with my song 
The echoes rattled far and free, 
Till on before I 
saw asthore 
The fairy form of Molly Cree ! 
her ankle tight, her form so light, 
Without a 
word soon did for me. 
" 
Arrah, Colleen !" I 
cried, " I'll die by your side." 
" 
So you may, if you please," cried Molly Cree. 
" 
Och ! Molly Cree! Och, Molly Cree, 
I'm kilt if you're not kind to me, 
For a 
murderous dart sticks in my heart." 
" 
And there let it stick," cried Molly Cree. 
I 
first looked blue then ogles threw 
To melt her hard heart tender, oh! 
But words she grudged, so on I 
trudged, 
Burnt up like any cinder, oh ! 
Then at the fair when once got there 
I 
whiskey took love's thirst to cure, 
Till at last I 
found the tent go round, 
So I 
lay for safety on the flure; 
As there I 
lay who should come in the way 
But a 
Connaught boy named Darby Lee, 
ROONY FROM BALLINAFAD. 
29 
And by his side, dressed like a 
bride, 
Crying " Piper play up !" stood Molly Cree. 
" 
Och! Molly Cree, Och! Molly Cree, 
Sure you'll not dance wid any but me. 
I'd rather have died than have seen you his bride." 
" 
You may die and be ci—d," says Molly Cree. 
My blood waxed warm, I 
vowed him harm, 
Then firmly grasped my alpeen, oh! 
Next up I 
sprung and a 
peal I 
rung 
On the skull of Pat Lee, that spalpeen, oh ! 
He paid me back with many a'whack, 
Till up intirely both vere done, 
While the boys they cried " Once more for the bride," 
And the girls all tittered to see the fun ; 
Our heads they bound and the glass went round, 
And I 
took the hand of Molly Cree. 
" 
Arrah Molly my life, here's an end of all strife, 
But you should have been wife to none but me, 
Oth! Molly Cree, Och! Molly Cree, 
Why . are you wedded to Darby Lee 1" 
"I'm not," she cried. " What ! not his bride 7" 
"No—only his sister," cried Molly Cree.

IN 
Ireland so frisky, with girls and sweet whiskey, 
We manage to keep care and sorrow aloof, 
Our whirligig revels made all the blue devils 
Fly out with the smoke through a

Right well I 
remember one foggy November

Go bother the ninnies clear out of their guineas ;" 
Away then I

Was shipwrecked and murdered and sold for a

Over mountains and rivers was pelted to shivers 
And met on dry land with a

While I

Of Sairy and Gipsey Davy. 
Chorus. 
Oh she was a 
nice little prairie hen, 
And he was a 
gay young baby, 
So Sairy left her parients 
To follow Gipsey Davy. 
Last night I 
lay in my father's halls 
A-snoring like a 
lady, 
But to night I'll lie on the cold, cold ground 
In the arms of my Gipsey Davy. 
Oh she was, etc. 
Farewell, pawpaw and mawmaw dear, 
For I 
am going to lave ye, 
And travel on my mussuel 
Along with the Gipsey Davy. 
Oh she was, etc. 
Now there was a 
policeman tall, 
His name it was O'Grady, 
He nabbed this pair of lobsters, 
Sairy and Gipsey Davy. 
Oh she was, etc. 
He brought them right before the judge, 
Who says, " Nothing can save ye, 
Just take 'em down for thirty days, 
Sairy and Gipsey Davy." 
Oh she was, etc.

A IR—" Things I 
don't like to see." 
BILL Shakspmre who understood human affairs, 
Said the world was a 
sta ye and the people the fares, 
And Shakspeare himself nothing truer could say 
If he'd spent his life -driving a 
stage in Broadway ; 
How manifest ' tis every person alive 
Who enters life's coach has an itching to drive— 
The infant is striving to drive its mamma, 
While she with a 
broomstick is driving papa. 
Bill Shakspeare, etc.—first haif verse for chorus. 
Our great politicians in driving delight, 
Yet neglect the direction to keep to the right, 
But through thick and thin dash to become public feeders 
Till the people to check 'em just pull up the leaders. 
The tyrant coquette as a 
matter of course 
Thinks her lover must mind the rein just like a 
horse ; 
Discouraged he leaves her, she sees her mistake, 
And laments that she did " the wrong passenger wake." 
Bill Shakspeare, etc. 
Of all the hard driving the hardest I'm sure 
The wretched old bachelor has to endure; 
POOR PADDY O'DLANEY. 
If on earth he would ever true happiness feel, 
Let One tell him a 
wife's the main spoke in his wheel; 
To those single females who ardently strive 
Yet fear it's too late a 
good bargain to drive, 
They're privileged surely when leap year prevails 
To make their proposals to transport the males. 
Bill Shakspeare, etc. 
The soldier's a 
driver as all of you know, 
in war his delieht is in driving the foe ; 
Our enemies ever he's ready to drub, 
Though in peace he's a 
lady's man up to the hub ; 
Though the flag of rebellion may float for a 
while 
Ile soon laid it low in a 
masterly style ; 
By the flag of our Union forever he'll stand 
And compel all creation to honor our land.

ALE—" Paddy O'Rafferty." 
SURE never a 
lad loved like Paddy O'Blaney, 
Whose heart was pierced through by sweet Sally Delaney, 
°eh she was a 
lass of the finest of breeding, 
And ne'er spoke a 
word all the time she was feeding; 
Something odd too it is, as perhaps you may think, 
She had just the same way when she happened to drink ; 
Och! The divil may bless the bright eyes of Delaney 
For piercing the heart of poor Paddy O'Blaney. 
'Twas by daylight one night, as she happened to pass, 
As 1 
fast asleep lay awake on the grass, 
She looked like an angel, I 
thought to my sorrow, 
So I 
pulled off my cap and I 
bid her good morrow, 
But she bade me farewell without saying a 
word, 
Which made both my cheeks look as red as a 
curd; 
THE PHANTOM PIG AND THE BUTCRERMAN. 
33 
Och! the divil may thank you, says I, Sal Delaney, 
You've cut in three halves the poor heart of O'Blaney. 
I 
told her for grunters I'd got a 
good stye, sir, 
And a 
field of potatoes far off just hard by, sir, 
But if to the church she'd not willingly go, 
To answer me yes she need only say no ; 
So against both our wills, faith, I 
gained her consent, 
And wrangling from morning till night, live content ; 
Surely now I 
must love my sweet Sally Delaney, 
Who first broke, and then mended the heart of O'Blaney.

IT 
was the bloody butcherman 
That knit his swarthy brow, 
And swore the gentle pig must die, 
And sealed it with a 
vow, 
And, ah ! it was the gentle pig 
Lay stretched along the ground, 
And oh ! it was the bloody knife 
his faithful heart had found. 
Fol lol de rol, etc. 
They took him then, three savage men, 
And dragged him all along, 
And in his mouth they put a

And through his heels a

And round and round an oaken beam 
A hempen cord they flung, 
And like a 
mighty pendulum, 
All solemnly he swung.

It was the butcher's youngest son 
That rent the air with sighs, 
And with his pocket handkerchief 
He wiped his little eyes. 
" 
Oh father, father, list to me, 
The pig is deadly sick, 
And men have hung hirii by the heels, 
And fed him with a 
stick." 
Fol lol de rol, etc. 
It was the bloody butcherman 
That laughed as he would die, , 
But he did soothe the sorrowing child, 
And told him not to cry : 
" 
Oh Nathan, Nathan, what's a 
pig, 
That you should weep and wail I 
Come, bear you like a 
butcher's boy, 
And you shall have the tail." 
Fol lot de rol, etc. 
The pig he hung, the pig he swung, 
And fearfully he bled; 
The butcher didn t 
care a 
pin, 
But quiet went to bed. 
He slept—but herds of murdered pigs 
Were busy with his dreams, 
And dreadful was their agony, 
And fearful were their screams. 
Fol lot de rol, etc. 
The butcherman then started up 
With horror and affright, 
For by his side the murdered pig 
Was standing bolt upright; 
Ah, yes, it was the slaughtered swine 
Appeared at his bedside, 
Ilk form erect, his curly tail 
All in a 
bow-knot tied. 
Fol lot de rol, etc. 
PARODY ON " THE LIGHT OF OTHER DAYS."

"What want you here 7" the butcher cried; 
" 
I've done you no affront." 
The pig but grinned a 
ghastly smile, 
And answered with a 
grunt, 
" 
Oh bloody, bloody butcherman, 
My death have you forgot 1 
But I'll forgive you if you will 
Untie this ere bow-knot." 
Fol lol de rot, etc. 
ENCORE VERSES TO THE PHANTOM PIG. 
The butcher grasped the phantom tail, 
For he waxed something bold, 
And like an icicle it felt, 
All tapering and cold, 
And having then untied the knot— 
Unutterable woe— 
When he did strive to lose his hold, 
He found it was no go. 
Fol / 01 de fol, etc. 
Away went pig and butchman, 
Like a

The butcher found the meaning out 
Of going the whole hog; 
He then awoke, for ' twas a

And pleased was he to find 
The phantom pig had vanished 
With his phantom tail behind.

Soon they heard her daddy's footsteps—he'd been hiding

And lie was taken with the cramp and in the water

But fate had metamorphized them in pity of their woe, 
Now they keep an oyster saloon on the West Broadway 
plan, where they sell doughnuts, pigs' feet, peanuts 
and other refreshments to the mermaids down below.

THE AGE OF ADULTERATIONS. 
As sung by GEO. Bnoouus in " Life in New York." 
Ant—" Things I 
don't like to see." 
ALL our tradesmen it's plain at no roguery stop, 
They adulterate all that they've got in their shop ; 
You must buy what they sell and they sell what they 
please, 
For they would if they could sell the moon for green 
cheese; 
Imitation ' tis well known is now all the rage, 
Everything imitated is in this rare age, 
Tea, coffee, beer, butter, gin, milk, and, hi brief, 
No doubt they'll soon imitate mutton and beef. 
Tol de rol, etc. • 
The grocers sell ash leaves and sloe leaves for tea, 
Tinged with Dutch pink and verdigris just like bolfea;

And treat us like horses, deserve a

The milkman, although he is honest he vows, 
Milks his pump night and morn quite as oft as his cows, 
Claps you plenty of chalk in your score—what a

And besides claps you plenty of chalk in your milk; 
The baker will say all his bread's made of flour, 
But just mention alum, you'll make him turn sour, 
his ground bones and pebbles turn men skin and bone, 
We ask him for bread and he gives us a 
stoile. 
Tol de rol, etc. 
The butcher puffs up his tough mutton for lamb, 
And sends you in chops from some old mountain ram, 
Bleed poor worn-out cows to pass off for white veal, 
For which he deserves to die by his own steel ; 
Another thing too which you'll own's very hard, 
The soap-fat man's kettle .provides us with lard, 
Pork sausages too seldom come from the hogs, 
The more of them's eaten the scarcer are dogs. 
Tol de rol, etc. 
The brewer a 
chemist is, that is quite clear, 
For we soon find no hops have hopped into his beer, 
'Stead of malt he from drugs brews his porter and swipes, 
So no wonder that we have so often the gripes ; 
The tobacconist smokes us with short-cut of weeds, 
And find his returns of such trash still succeeds ; 
With snuff made of dust we so often are nulled, 
And for serving our noses so his should b pulled.

The wine merchant that we abroad may not roam, 
With sloe juice and spirits makes our Port at home; 
The distillers their gin have with vitriol filled, 
So 'tis clear they're in roguery double-distilled; 
Thus we rogues have in- grain and in tea too, that's clear, 
But don't think I 
suppose there are any rogues here; 
Present company's always excepted, you know, 
So wishing all rogues their deserts, I

The stove was red and cold the morn

And the wet-nurse bared her arms of skin, 
And the tea, oh, it warmed the doctor's chin, 
And I 
in his face like a

To welcome the tea—a 
new-born child ; 
I 
have lived—who never tasted pap— 
Full fifty summers a

With cash to spend and the power to think, 
And never have thought to change my drink,

THE GALLANT PAUL ZONES. 
As sung by GEO. BROOKES in " Paul Jones, the Pilot." 
Ant — " 
The Star-Spangled Banner." 
[The first flag Of the Revolution was raised by Paul Jones's own 
hand on board -the " Alfred," on the Delaware River, in 1776. 
It 
was a 
Pine Tree, having a 
rattlesnake coiled at the root of it, with 
the motto, " Don't tread on me."] 
A soNG unto Liberty's brave buccaneer, 
Ever bright be the fame of the patriot rover, 
For our rights he first fought in his " Black Privateer," 
And faced the proud foe ere our sea they crossed over; 
In their channel and coast 
He scattered their host, 
And proud Britain robbed of her sea-ruling boast, 
And her rich merchants' barks skimmed the ocean in fear 
Of Paul Jones, fair Liberty's brave buccaneer. 
In the first fleet that sailed in defence of our land, 
Paul Jones forward stood to defend Freedom's ardor, 
lie led the bold " Alfred" at Hopkins' command, 
And drove the fierce foemen from Providence harbor; 
'Twas his hand that raised 
The first flag that blazed, 
And his deeds ' neath the " Pine Tree" all ocean amazed, 
For hundreds of foes met a 
watery bier 
From Paul Jones, fair Liberty's bold buccaneer. 
NEW VERSION OF " PADDY O'NEIL." 
As sung by GEO. Buocums in " Irish Blunders." 
ON 
April the first I 
set off like a 
fool 
From Kilkenny to Dublin to see Lawrence Toole, 
My mother's third cousin, who often wrote down 
For to come and see how he flourished in town. 
I 
scarce had set foot in the terrible place 
Before a 
spalpeen came and stared in my face; 
He called to a 
press gang, they came without fail, 
And soon neck and crop carried Patrick O'Neil. 
They scampered away as they thought with a 
prize, 
Taking me for a 
sailor, you see, in disguise, 
But a 
terrible blunder they made in their strife, 
For I 
ne'er saw a 
ship or the sea in my life; 
Then straight to a 
tender they made me repair, 
Of tenderness divil a 
morsel was there ; 
Och ! I 
stamped and I 
cursed, but it did not avail, 
Till a 
great swimming castle met Patrick O'Neil. 
This big swimming thief rolled about in the tide, 
With all her front teeth sticking out of her side, 
Where they bid me to mount and be sure for to grip 
Fast hold with my trotters for fear I 
should slip ; 
I 
let go my hands and stuck fast with my toes, 
And, how it could happen faix nobody knows, 
Fell plump in the water and splashed like a 
whale, 
Till pretty well pickled was Paddy O'Neil. 
46 
A PAIR OF IRISH JANUS'S. 
With a 
great roar of laughter they hoisted me in 
To this huge wooden world full of riot and din ; 
What strings and what pulleys attracted my eye, 
And how large were the sheets that were hung out to dry ; 
It seemed Noah's Ark, stuffed with different guests, 
hogs, peddlers, geese, sailors and all other beasts; 
Some drank bladders of gin, some had pitchers of ale, 
While some sat and laughed at poor Paddy O'Neil. 
Then to go down below I 
expressed a 
great wish, 
Where they live under water like so many fish ; 
I 
was clapt in a 
mess with some more of the crew, 
They called it Banyan day and gave me burgoo ; 
For a 
bed I'd a 
sack.swung, as high as my chin, 
They called it a 
hammock and bid me get in ; 
I 
took a 
great leap, but my footing was frail, 
For clean over canted was Patrick O'Neil. 
The divil a 
wink could I 
sleep all the night, 
And awoke the next morn in a 
terrible fright— 
" 
Up hammocks down chests," they began for to bawl, 
" 
There's an inimy in sight," " Poo," says I, " is that all?" 
Then we hauled up our large window shutters with speed, 
And run out our bull dogs of true Irish breed ; 
While the creatures gave mouth I 
held fast by the tail, 
And they kicked and run over poor Paddy O'Neil.

THE ONE-EYED JUSTICE. 
As sung by GEO. BROOKES. 
BEFORE Justice Ogle, who had but one eye, 
All in vain an old woman for pardon was pleading, 
So she thought could she get on his blind side so sly, 
She might slyly escape out of court, he not heeding; 
Slowly she stept, 
Warily crept, 
Stretched out her crutch, hobbled to get from justice's 
clutch, 
But the judge saw her budge, 
With mouth wide, fierce he cried, 
" 
Do you think, you old jade, to get round my blind 
side 3" 
The old woman a 
daughter had, bright as a 
rose, 
And that moment his lordship on her glanced his peeper, 
And his little sharp eye shone beside his red nose, 
Fixed as if in its sight it forever would keep her ; 
Fondly he winked, 
Nodded and blinked; 
Meantime the old dame hobbled away, though blind and 
lame, 
But the judge saw her budge, 
And he sighed as he cried, 
" 
This old woman's daughter's found out my blind side."

And for beauty was famed for miles around, 
But yet all the ladies at him looked shy, 
For at thirty he was only three feet high.

This shocking disaster it plagued him sore, 
For when he ventured outside the door, 
The people would bawl and after him run, 
Crying, " There goes a 
queer little figure of fun.' 
Ri tu ral lu, etc. 
Half mad, Mynheer knew not what to do, 
Too old to grow taller he very well knew, 
When all in the dumps, as he sat one day, 
The steam doctor's chariot rolled that way. 
Ri tu ral in, etc. 
This doctor he banished all sorrows and ills 
By making folks swallow. his patent steam pills, 
And so very infallible were their powers, 
That two would produce a 
new leg in three hours. 
Ri tu ral lu, etc. 
Says Mynheer, who now was inspired with vigor, 
" 
Such pills as these must make me grow bigger," 
So he went to the doctor without more delay, 
Who gave him a 
dozen, then sent him away. 
Ri tu ral lu, etc. 
Von Shop, delighted, went home to bed, 
But scarce on the pillow had laid his head, 
1Then the pills took enct and he grew so i' fegs, 
That he knocked down the front of the house with his 
legs. 
Ri tu ral in, etc. 
ASTONISHING STEAM PILLS.

Then he got out of bed in great amaze, 
But upright his body he could not raise, 
For the pills were so strong in one hour or nigh 
The Dutchman had grown nearly twenty feet high. 
Ri tu ral lu, etc. 
From the door of his room he could make no retreat, 
So he stepped through the front of the house to the street, 
But his terror increased when he had got in it, 
his legs shot up full two inches a 
minute. 
Ri tu ral In, etc. 
The effect of the pills was so strong besides 
That his lanky legs took such terrible strides, 
And in less than a 
day so much taller was he, 
That the tops of the houses scarce reached his knee ! 
Ri tu ral in, etc. 
In vain he tried his growth to stay, 
The pills were so strong they kept working away ; 
And his body increased so in bulk and might 
That he knocked down whole streets in the course of his 
Ristu ral In, etc. 
For years he kept running and growing ' 'tis said, 
Till at last one day he grew himself (lead ; 
And so great was the shock when he fell on the ground, 
That it shook all the country for forty miles round. 
Ri tu ral lu, etc. 
When the coroner's inquest next day went to see, 
They were very much puzzled where he could be, 
His body was gone ! their verdict was just, 
For the steam pills had turned him into dust.

Jack loved his friends, and was true to his Molly, 
And if honor gives greatness, was great as a 
king. 
One night as we drove, with two reefs in the mainsail, 
And the scud came lowering upon a 
lee shore, 
Jack went up aloft to hand the top- gallant sail, 
A 
spray washed him off, and we ne'er saw him more. 
Chorus. 
But grieving's a 
folly, come let its be jolly, 
if we've troubles at sea, boys, we've pleasures ashore. 
Whistling Tom, still of mischief or fun in the middle, 
Through life in all weathers at random would jog, 
He'd dance, and he'd sing, and he'd play on the fiddle, 
And swig with an air his allowance of grog; 
Longside of a 
Don in the Terrible frigate, 
As yard-arm and yard-arm, we lay off the shore, 
In and out, whistling Tom (Ed so caper and jig it, 
That his head was shot off, and we saw him no more. 
But grieving's a 
folly, etc. 
Bonny Ben was to each of his messmates a 
brother; 
He was manly and honest, good-natured and free; 
If ever one tar was more true than another, 
To his friend and his duty, that sailor was he. 
One day, from the davit, to heave the kedge anchor, 
Ben went in the boat on a 
bold craggy shore, 
lie overboard tipt, when a 
shark and a 
spanker 
Soon nipt him in two, and we ne'er saw him more. 
.But grieving's a 
folly, etc. 
But what of it, lads 'i 
shall we be down-hearted 
Because that, mayhap, we now take our last sup ; 
Life's cable must one day or other be parted. 
And death, in fast moorings, will bring us all up. 
But 'tis always the way on't, one scarce finds a

Firm as pitch, honest, hearty, and true to the core,

Sure ha Vothered them all with his wonderful tune, 
And the likes of that same when it came in his head, 
it never was equalled by living or dead. 
Oh that wonderful tune, the wonderful tune, 
Was played by the piper, bould Terry O'Roon. 
'Tis said when he struck up his pipes by the shore, 
That the fishes danced jigs and the sea ceased to roar, 
That the rocks split with laughter, and herrings and sprats 
Would foot it with shellfish and roundfish and flats, 
To the wonderful tune, etc. 
Be that as it may, Terry swears it is true, 
But he might have been dreaming, between me and you, 
Or a 
taste of the crather that caused him to think, 
For pipers have ever been jewels to drink, 
With their wonderful tune, etc. 
And Terry himself, if the whiskey was strong, 
ne'er played so Well nor so loud nor so long 
Till he set them all dancing—sly Terry O'Roon, 
For whatever he played was a

Placing his teakettle over the fire; 
Soon it tips over— St. Patrick ! he's mad enough—

Awkward enough see him kneading his dough, 
Troth ! if the bread he could eat without swallowing, 
how it would favor his palate you know. 
Chorus.

queer looking place it is, 
Keep me from such all the days of my life, 
Sure, but I 
think what a 
burning disgrace it is, 
Never at all to be getting a 
wife. 
His dishcloth is missing, the pigs are devouring it, 
In the pursuit he has battered his shin; 
A 
plate wanted washing, the cat is a-scouring it, 
Thunder an' turf! what a 
pickle he's in, 
his meal being over, the table's left setting so, 
Never a 
bit is the bed made at all, 
When hunger comes on himlie's fuming and fretting so, 
Everything's dirty in Bachelor's hall. 
Bachelor's hall, etc. 
Pots, dishes and pans and such greasy commodities, 
Ashes and pratie skins cover the floor, 
His cupboard's a 
storehouse of comical oddities, 
Things that had never been neighbors before, 
Late in the night then he goes to bed shivering, 
Dishes take care of yourselves if you can, 
Ile creeps like a

Och ! let him alone for a 
baste of a

say nay 7 
My trotter take and be my bride, or else this pointed fork 
I'll stick into my precious side and turn myself to pork." 
Miss Piggy then looked very grave, behind her snout 
blushed she, 
" 
Oh gallant gentle Mr. Pig, pray rise up from your knee, 
My pa and ma won't hear of it, as you go grunting by, 
They'll slam right into your pig's face the door of our 
pig stye." 
Then Mr. Pig he bustled up, says he, " You must allow, 
Your father he is but a 
hog, your mother she's a 
sow, 
WHACK FOR OULD IRELAND. 
But make my prize those lovely eyes, those cheeks so 
like the rose, 
I'll place a 
ring upon your toe like that upon your nose." 
" 
If I 
yield up my melting heart and quit my father's 
shed, . 
Won't you become as cold and dull as any pig of lead I 
Not roll me in a 
char-i-ot as folks of fashion do, 
But roll me in a 
sausage or a 
pudding black to view 1" 
" 
No, singe my whiskers if I 
do, I'll love you true, by gosh, 
But see the trembling moonbeams, how they play on 
yon hogwash." 
" 
Sweet home, adieu ! dear love, with you I'll quit these 
hated doors, 
And hark, the lark dispels the dark, and how my mammy 
snores." 
Upon her pretty pettitoes away Miss Pig did flee, 
And ho, ho, ho, went Mr. Pig, and week, week, week went 
she •, 
A look she cast, her tears fell fast as she her home did spy, 
And so would you if you had got a 
stye, main, in your eye. 
The old ones waddled after them, but they were not o'er-
taken, 
For having in hams more brawn, the young ones saved 
their bacon ; 
To church they went, six virgin pigs strewed chestnuts at 
the door, 
And the parson was like many of ours, a 
most confounded 
boar. 
WRACK FOR OULD IRELAND. 
As sung by GEO. BROOKES. 
—" Dancing Delilah." 
W HEN I was a 
boy, in the town of Kilkenny, 
I 
fell deep in love with sweet Juggy Delaney, 
AN UNFORTUNATE CUSS. 
59 
She'd a 
nate taper waist like a 
cow in the middle, 
And so sweetly she'd dance to the drum or the fiddle. 
Chorus. 
Singing whack for ould Ireland, the country for whiskey, 
The girls are so fair and the boys are frisky, 
For drinking, for fighting or handling a 
flail, 
Oh the boys of ould Ireland will never turn tail. 
Now the beauties of Juggy to sing's my intention, 
If you're dying in love now her charms I 
won't mention, 
She'd a 
pair of black eyes, be me sowl I'm no joker; 
Like two holes in a 
blanket burnt in with a 
poker. 
Singing whack, etc. 
Oh her cheeks, red as bricks, set me all in a 
bustle, 
And she'd open her mouth as she'd open a 
mussle, 
She'd a 
nate row of teeth—she had two, by me soul, 
And her tongue hung between like a 
toad in a 
hole. 
Singing whack, etc. 
Now Juggy Delaney has made me her wife, 
Though two, we are one all the rest of our life, 
We've a 
pair of fine daughters as fresh as the morn, 
But what pleases me most, they're both Irishmen born. 
Singing whack, etc.

As sung by GEO. BROOKES. 
A IR—" A 
Nice Young Man." 
On when I

With my present situation, 
I 
plainly see I've been such a 
dunce, 
I'm filled with lamentation;

THE OLD MAID AND HER LOVERS. 
61 
Before I 
did begin for to drink rum and gin, 
how happy I 
could be, 
But since that day I 
throwed myself away, 
Now every one cuts me. 
Oh fol lol lol, etc. 
I 
used to with the ladies meet, 
To parties was invited ; 
When asked to sing, why I 
sung so sweet, 
They were every one delighted; 
But now I've lost my grace, and my voice is so base 
By drinking so many drams, 
It's cracked and split, that I 
find it only fit 
To cry, " Here's yer soft-shell clams ! 
Oh folio' lol, etc. 
When I 
think what a 
case I've got to be, 
My heart is filled with grief, 
My friends have all deserted me, 
As if I 
were a 
thief; 
Vother day in the street an old friend I 
did meet, 
And after him I 
did foller ; 
Says I, " Mr. Lee, why, don't you know me 7 " 
Says he, " I 
wouldn't know you for a 
dollar." 
Oh fol lol lol, etc. 
When I 
thinks what I've lost it makes me grieve, 
My heart is filled with sighs, 
The tears roll down, and I 
takes my sleeve 
And wipes them from my eyes ; 
Sometimes I 
have to eat what I 
can get in the street, 
Though better I 
prefers, 
Every day I 
feel dismayed, for I'm always afraid 
Of piz,ened sasseng,ers. 
Oh fol lol lol, etc. 
My hat it's wore and bumped about, 
My coat is rent asunder, 
My shoes are tore so my toes stick out, 
And the uppers have turned under ; 
At night I 
have to weep for l've no place to sleep, 
Though a 
straw bed would delight me ; 
In an alley or a 
shed I 
have to make my bed, 
And the dogs are sure to bite me. 
Oh fol lol lol, etc. 
Last night I 
slept upon a 
still, 
And laid as still as a 
mouse, 
But soon a 
policeman gaVe me a 
haul, 
And we went to the station house, 
And there the magistrate, for to make worse my fate, 
lie looks at time and says, 
" 
I 
see by your face you're a 
very hard case, 
So I'll give you thirty days." 
Oh fol lol lol, etc. 
THE OLD MAID AND HER LOVERS. 
Air--" -Whack! row de dow." 
A 
MAIDEN once there was and she was ugly, old and tough, 
But lovers she found plentiful because she had the stuff ; 
With her leering, sneering lovers queering,. 
Oh she could be sporting some, 
For every afternoon to her levee they would courting 
come. 
Chorus. 
With a 
whack, row de dow, 
Fol de rol de raddy addy, 
Whack. row de dow, 
Fol de daddy de. 
An alderman came first, like a 
turtle, I 
declare, 
If she married him there'd of turtles been a 
pair, 
62 
OH , FAIT.' 
MAID OF PASSAGE . 
With his waddle, twaddle, empty noddle, 
Corporation fat and spruce, sir, 
But she told him soon all he could do would be of no 
use, sir, 
With a 
whack, row de dow, etc. 
An attorney, too, there was—with him the cash ran shy, 
lie came in hymen's court, he said, with tier a 
cause to try, 
With his smirks and quirks, his flaws and jerks, 
Law never had confuted him, 
But the cause was ended soon and Miss McCann nonsuited 
him. 
With his whack, row de dow. 
The next that came a 
courting to the lovely Miss McCann 
Was a 
foreign music-master, sure but he was not her man, 
With his shaking, quaking, ballad making, 
his fiddle-stick and music paper. 
" 
Oh," says she, " you're out of time, so get along you 
catgut scraper." 
With a 
whack, row de dow, etc. 
But the boy that won her heart you soon shall understand, 
An Irishman he was, his shillelah in his hand, 
With whiskey, frisky, all so brisk he, 
Gramachree did sing so sweetly 
That to church he led her soon, and her money bags be 
managed neatly, 
With his whack, row de dow, etc. 
OH, FAIR MAID OF PASSAGE, YOU'RE PLUMP AS A 
SASSAGE. 
A IR—" Shady, ye Gander." 
On, fair maid of passage, 
As plump as a 
sassage, 
OH , FAIR MAID OF PASSAGE . 
As mild as a 
kitten, as mild as a 
kitten ; 
Those eyes in your face, 
Yerrah ! pity my case, 
For poor Dermod is smitten, poor Dermod is smitten, 
For softer than silk, 
And more white nor new milk, 
Your lily-white band is, your lily-white hand is ; 
Your lips red as cherries, 
Your eyes like blackberries, 
And you're straight as a 
wand is, as straight as a 
wand is. 
Your talk is so quare, 
And your sweet curly hair 
Is as black as the devil, as black as the devil; 
And your breath is as sweet, too, 
As any potato, 
Or orange from Seville, or orange from Seville ; 
When dressed in her boddice 
She trips like a 
goddess, 
So nimble and frisky, so nimble and frisky ; 
One kiss from her cheek, 
'Tis so soft and so sleek, 
Would warm me like whiskey, would warm inc like whis-
key. 
So I 
sobs and I 
pine, 
And I 
grunts like a 
swine, 
Because you're so cruel, because you're so cruel; 
No rest can I 
take, 
-All asleep or awake, 
But I 
dream of my jewel, I 
dream of my jewel. 
Your hate then give over, 
Nor Dermod your lover, 
So cruelly handle, so cruelly handle. 
Or, begorra, I'll die, 
Like a 
pig in a 
stye, 
Or a 
snuff of a 
candle, a 
snuff of a 
candle.

why for the things that are gone do we weep, 
And embitter the joys of to day 7 
When one sip of the wine- cup would certainly sweep • 
All past recollection away. 
The troubles, the cares, that have once dimmed the brow 
Will ne'er o'ershade it again, 
DO YOU THINK I'M AN UGLY MAN 7 
Then why blast the pleasures life yet may allow 
By reflections that need not remain. 
Come fill up the cup, etc. 
DO YOU THINK I'M AN UGLY MAN? 
As sung by GEO. BROOKES. 
Am—" Nice Young Man." 
I 
THINK if you look at my figure and face 
You surely might see many worse, 
Could I 
but in some lady's heart find a 
place, 
For beauty I'd point to my purse; 
By some I 
am told that I 
look rather old, 
But believe it I 
never can, 
If not an Adonis, I've plenty of gold, 
And I'm not such an ugly man. 
Now give your opinion kind folks if you please, 
Do you think I'm an ugly man 7 
I'm none of your regular beauties, I 
own, - 
Still there's something about me uncommon, 
My head's rather bald and my cheek's rather brown, 
And my nose rather puggy than Roman; 
Then look at my eyes, I 
don't say they're a 
pair, 
And my forehead's the color of tan, 
I've plenty of mouth and though few teeth are there, 
Yet I'm not such an ugly man. 
Now give, etc. 
Yet, would you believe it, girls take delight 
In making me food for their mirth, 
They begged I 
would come to a 
party one night, 
"f was the pleasantest party on earth, 
And so too, thought I, till a 
forward young child 
With its innocent prattle began, 
are14-g 
66 
THE WAY THE MONEY GOES. 
And she said with such point that the company smiled, 
" 
Law, ma, what an ugly man." 
Now give, etc. 
To the Broadway menagerie I 
went t'other day, 
The giraffe and the lions to see, 
Strange birds and queer beasts no attraction had they, 
But all eyes were turned upon me, 
Some called me a 
baboon and some ourang outang, 
Or a " what is it " fresh from J'apan, 
But a 
lady soon stopped all their clatter and clang, 
With, "'Bless me, that's the ugly man.'' 
Now give, etc. 
Now what's in a 
face?, I 
have heard people say, 
Why that all depends upon liking, 
Mine is one of the sort you don't see every day, 
There are very few faces so striking; 
And handsome is he who the handsome thing does, 
And this, ladies all, is my plan, 
Will any one have me 1 
what a 
general buzz, 
Why, I 
can't be an ugly man— 
You've given your opinions, I'm very well pleased, 
That I'm not such an ugly man.

BROOKES' VERSION. 
As sung by GEO. BROOKES. 
Am--" The Lazy Club." 
W E 
find throughout this earthly ball, 
The one thing needful governs all, 
Big and little, dunces, scholars, 
Nothing's done without the dollars ; 
That specie's out of date, you know, 
And greenbacks now are all the go, 
THE WAY THE MONEY GOES. 
And as abroad the paper flows, 
It's awful how the money goes. 
Tiddy fol, etc. 
The bachelor, tired of single life, 
Resolves to venture on a 
wife; 
his house is furnished all in taste, 
And purse and pockets run to waste; 
She orders sofas, couches, chairs, 
Curtains, carpets, china wares; 
Each day her taste more costly grows, 
And that's the way the money goes. 
Tiddy fol, etc. 
A 
lot of real estate you buy, 
To rent your houses out you try, 
But spite of all that you can do, 
Repairs and taxes eat you through; 
At last, and much to your delight, 
Your tenant moves away at night; 
Of course a 
twelvemonth's rent he owes, 
And that's the way the money goes. 
Tiddy fol, etc. 
And then again you join the set 
Where jolly boys are always met, 
And round the bar are daily found, 
While brandy, wine and wit go round, 
With gin and cocktails not a 
few, 
Toddies, slings, and juleps too, 
Champagne in goblets freely flows, 
And that's the way the money goes. 
Tiddy fol, etc. 
In summer time the cash has wings— 
The ladies all must see the springs— 
Travelling charges, hotel bills, 
Steamboats, railroads, other ills ; 
68 
A MAN WITH FIVE SWEETHEARTS. 
In winter balls and hops abound, 
Or in a 
sleigh you skim the ground, 
Stay out all night, get no repose. 
And that's the way the money goes. 
Tiddy IA etc. 
No wonder money is so scarce, 
While market charges are so fierce ; 
The price of pork brings great distress, 
And five- cent loaves grow daily less ; 
The price of honey does increase, 
The greenback issue don't decrease, 
how we're to live nobody knows, 
And that's the way the money goes.

Wid my brogue and my blarney and bothering ways,

To marry her first that is first in the mind,

And I

She'll have me as soon as her husband does die, 
An' he's now sick in bed, like a

So I 
pledge her bright eyes in a—basin o' soup, 
Wid my brogue, etc. 
A buxom young widow, I 
think it no crime 
Accidently to drop on, about dinner time, 
Wid my brogue, et; 
She takes off the cover, I 
see the beef smoke, 
She cuts me a 
slice—then I 
cuts her a

She has two little childer' an' I

For I

Wid my brogue, etc. 
When wid the young widow's ould wine I've made free,

start off in haste, wid the fourth to take tea, 
Wid my brogue, etc. 
An' ould maid who's husband must sure be her nurse, 
What matter for that, when she's got a 
long purse, 
Surrounded she is by eats, kittens, and pups, 
An' of tea I 
take wid her—about sixteen cups, 
Wid my brogue, etc. 
The fifth is a 
lady, faith, richer than all, 
And she thinks I 
am handsome, tho' I'm not at all, 
Wid my brogue, etc. 
I 
go there to supper—it's by her desire, 
I

drink, and I 
sit by the fire. 
Altho' on hei back she has a 
large hunch, 
I 
make her a

And keep things ship-shape fore and aft,

In legal matters I'm no fudge, 
And can give any here a

I

And so does Mrs. Johnson. 
BIDDY MAGTHRE OF BALLLNACLASH. 
Ain--" The Priest of the Parish." 
'TwAs at Ballinaclash lived one Biddy Maguire, 
As neat a 
young creature as man could desire; 
Oh ! such was my love for this girl I 
adored, 
When I 
sighed in, my sleep sure they told me I 
snored. 
" 
Alf go' long, you gossoons," then says I 
to the wags, 
" 
Don't think that you're talking to one of your gags, 
Faith, Paddy is not such an ignorant elf 
But to know if he snored he must hear it himself." 
Then straight to the darling on Sunday I 
goes, 
Resolved to unburthen to her all my woes, 
And says I, " If a 
lover should sigh through his nose, 
Pray what is the cause 7"—" Pooh ! it's love, I 
suppose." 
" 
Then Biddy Maguire," says I, " this is my case, 
In my sleep still I 
see your own illigant face, 
And with both my eyes shut if I 
see you, asthore, 
With my ears open sure I 
should hear if I 
snore."

EIDDY MA GUIRE OF EALLINACLASH. 
Then Biddy and I 
went together to church, 
All the boys in the village were left in the lurch, 
Oh she looked so divine and she prayed so devout, 
That, faith, I 
scarce knew what myself was about; 
Returning home with her not over ten mile, 
She hopped like a 
Teprehann over each stile, 
And love with myself being busy the while, 
I 
caught hold of her apron and then caught a 
smile. 
Now Biddy had got a 
most beautiful blush, 
OIL she was the girl took the rag off the bush, 
So what to nobody myself would impart 
I 
told to the sowl, ' twas the state of my heart. 
" 
I've a 
cabin," says 1, " though ' tis not very big, 
I've a 
small taste of ground, would give grass to a 
pig, 
I've a 
two-legged gander, a 
hen and a 
drake, 
And sure I've myself that would die for your sake. 
" 
And sure all I 
have won't I 
share it with you, 
For your eyes, Biddy jewel, have pierced my heart 
through ; 
You look so engaging, I 
vow and declare, 
That I'd just like to see in your arms an heir." 
" 
Ah then fie for shame, Paddy," says Biddy to me, 
" 
How can you be afther a-making, so free 1 
For father O'Doherty says it's a 
shame 
To give yourself heirs without giving your name." 
" 
Be me sowl, then," says I, " sure the priest must be 
right, 
So my name, though it's Paddy. I'll give you this night, 
And faith it's but little the worse for the wear, 
So come ere the clergy is off on his mare." 
Then Biddy and I 
both together were tied, 
Oh she made a 
most monstrously beautiful bride, 
So I 
bought her tine ribbon to make a 
nate sash 
For my beautiful Biddy of Ballinaclash.
