PASTOR'S " COTTAGE BY THE SEA." 
Combination Song. 
Written by TONY PAsron. 
(The music of this Song can be obtained from OLrvEE DrrsoN & Co., 
Boston.) 
CHILDHOOD'S days now pass before me, 
Kiss me quick, sweet Nelly Bly; 
Carry me back to old Virginny, 
When the bloom is on the rye. 
Let me kiss him for his mother, 
At the wake of Teddy Ree; 
Brothers fainting at the door, 
In the cottage by the sea— 
Isabell with a 
gingham umbrella, 
In the cottage by the sea. 
Jane, my Jane, my pretty Jane, 
Let me like a 
soldier fall; 
Kiss my mother dear for me, 
At the oolored fancy ball. 
1* 
C 
I'D CHOOSE TO BE A BABY. 
Ann. Li 
sic, hang to the Union?. 
And the banner of the free; 
We are marching down to Dixie, 
In the cottage by the sea— 
John Brown's body lies a-mouldering 
In the cottage by the sea. 
I'd offer thee this hand of mine, 
With the dark girl dressed in blue; 
Maid of Athens, ere we part 
With a 
hoop de dooden doo! . 
The glorious vintage of champagne, 
gy bark is on the deep-blue sea; 
Who's dat knockin' at de door, 
In the cottage by the sea?— 
And my name it is Joe Bowers, 
In the cottage by the sea. 
Come where my love lies dreaming, 
When the swallows homeward fly; 
And the girl I 
left behind me, 
In my garret near the sky. 
Darkeys, hab you seen old massa? 
Dearest sister, think of me; 
flow are you, greenbacks, ten and twenty, 
In the cottage by the sea ?— 
We are on the road to Brighton, 
In the cottage by the sea. 
I'D CHOOSE TO BE A BABY. 
Written by E. W. M ACRNRY. 
As sung by TONY PASTOR. 
r D choose to be a 
baby, 
A:pretty little flower, 
A 
plaything for the ladies— 
No care in childhood's hour. 
_ 
I'D CHOOSE TO BE A BABY. 
7 
The ladies they would pet me, 
And pat me on the brow, 
And say I 
was a 
beauty— 
Why don't they say it now ? 
Chorus. 
I'd choose to be a 
baby, 
A pretty little flower, 
A plaything for the ladies— 
No care in childhood's hour. 
The girls would kiss and hug me, 
Saying, " That's a 
dear, don't cry," 
And fondly lull me fast asleep, 
And sing sweet lullaby. 
How they did press and cuddle me, 
Till I 
felt anyhow, 
Undress, and put me off to bedl— 
I 
wish they'd do it now. 
I'd choose to be, etc. 
How they did like to get me, 
And take me on their lap, 
Then fill my little belly 
With lollypops and pap! 
They'd smother me with kisses, 
And dress me fine somehow, 
And let me do whate'er I 
liked— 
I 
wish they'd do it now! 
I'd choose to be, etc. 
Oh, when I 
was a 
baby, 
They'd walk me- out serene, 
They'd powder me and wash me, 
And keep me nice and clean; 
They'd praise my little figure, 
And kiss me on the brow, 
Anci wish they had one like me— 
Why don't they do it now? 
I'd choose to be, etc.

NEW " JOHNNY, FILL. UP THE BOWL." 
NEW " JOHNNY, FILL DT THE BOWL," 
Written and sung by TONY PASTOR. 
THE Union cause is going ahead— 
Ahead I 
ahead! 
The Rebel cause will soon be dead— 
Be deadl be dead! 
Their game is up, and their hope is fled, 
And we'll make them pay for the blood they shed; 
We'll all drink to Uncle Sam— 
Johnny, fill up the bowl I 
What though they boast of a 
General Bragg— 
A Bragg—old Bragg— 
Who always follows their rebel rag— 
A rag—old rag I 
But at running away he'll never lag, 
When he gets in sight of the Union flag! 
We'll all drink to Uncle Sam— 
Johnny, fill up the bowl! 
Now there's brave General Rosecrans— 
Hurrah, hurrah! 
Wherever he went, he made them dance— 
Hurrah., hurrah I 
And the Union troops will still advance, 
Until Secession has nary a 
chance. 
We'll all drink to Uncle Sam— 
Johnny, fill up the ,bowl I 
Though Uncle Sam they. 
don't admire— 
Admire, admire, 
From Charleston he'll make them retire— 
Retire, retire, 
Or Gillmore there will knock them higher 
With a 
dose or two of that same Greek fire: 
We'll all drink to Uncle Sam— 
Johnny, fill up the bowl! 
HUNKYDORY. 
9 
And there's our gallant General GRANT---
Our Grant, brave Grant! 
Get clear of him the rebels can't— 
They can't, they can't! 
He gave them at Vicksburg all they want, 
And at Chattanooga he made them pant. 
We'll all drink to Uncle Sam— 
Johnny, fill up the bowl! 
When we strike Rebellion a 
final blow— 
Ho, ho I 
you know— 
Unto the world our power we'll show— 
Oho that's so; 
We'll send some troops to Mexico, 
And a 
few more into Canadall go! 
And we'll all drink to Uncle Sam— 
Johnny, fill up the bowl! 
HIINICYDORY. 
Written and sung by TONY Benoit. 
AIR—" Limerick Ramp." 
ONE of the boys am I, 
That always aril in clover; 
With spirits light and high, 
Well known am I 
all over. 
I'm always to be found 
At singing, in my glory; 
With your smiling faces round, 
It's then I'm hunkydory. 
Chorus—Ri tu di nu, etc. 
Now if a 
man is poor, 
Relations all will shun him; 
And should he owe a 
bill, 
His creditors will dun him. 
10 
But let him make a 
hit, 
Then it's quite a 
different story— 
How they'll fawning come around, 
Just because he's hunkydoryl 
Ri tu di nu, etc. 
A 
barber, full of airs, 
He takes to going arter 
-A gay Fifth- Avenue belle, 
A Wall-street broker's daughter. 
He swears that he's a 
Count, 
And she believes his story; 
They meet upon the sly, 
And soon he's hunkydory I 
Ri tu di nu, etc. 
A 
fast young dry-goods clerk, 
He loves a 
maiden sightly; 
She being one of the gals, 
He goes to see her nightly. 
His salary is small, 
So from his boss's store he 
Rich presents makes his dear, 
And of course he's hunkydory. 
Ri tu di nu, etc. 
A greenhorn, full of cash, 
Into the city getting, 
Drops into a 
faro-bank, 
And soon his cash is betting; 
He loses every time— 
The banker in his glory 
Cries, as he rakes the pile, 
"Oh, ain't I 
hunkydory?" 
Ri tu di nu, etc. 
In your handsome servant-maid 
An interest you're taking; 
You drop into your room 
While she the beds is making.

Your wife then happens in— 
In vain you tell your story; 
And she soon kicks up a

Saying she found you hunkydory.

S on th' Bloomingdale Road, 
Where the boys are jolly and free, 
There's a 
big double sleigh, all stowed 
With pretty girls laughing at me I 
Now Tom is kissing Miss Kate, 
And Sam is hugging Miss Long; 
We pass at a 
two-forty gait, 
While singing this " rollicking" song. 
Chorus. 
A 
life on th' Bloomingdale Road— 
We'll join the !merry throng; 
Each sleigh has a 
happy load, 
And the boys they dash along! 
They dash—they dash— 
And the boys they dash along! 
Swift over the snow we glide, 
There's a 
customer close behind: 
He lets his " flyer" slide, 
And comes up like the wind! 
For a 
moment or two we've " lapped"— 
" 
Take care, there! what are ye 'bout?" 
We pass—" Good-by, old chap I—

The sun is now setting fast; 
There's Dan with his " fancy" gray— 
" 
Two dollars to one that I

Our horse we'll no longer goad—

A 
I 
R—" The Album." 
Now every day brings something net 
As through the world we dash on; 
And now I'm going to sing to you— 
My subject is the fashion. 
While some get tight, some " go it" loose— 
Some at a 
pace that's slashing; 
But, right or wrong, the sole excuse 
Is, " Because it is the fashion." 
It's the fashion for our rulers now 
With new power to be invested— 
To suspend the habeas corpus, 
And have citizens arrested; - 
To send them off to the " Bastile" 
Without any form of trial; 
But the State is right in stopping that, 
Of that there's no denial. 
It the fashion is for England now 
The rebels for to aid, sir, 
By fitting pirates for the sea, 
And running our blockade, sir: 
While Gideon Welles he takes his nap, 
Like Rip Van Winkle in the drama, 
POLLY PERKINS. 
13 
But it's nearly time that he'd wake up, 
And catch the Alabama. 
It's the fashion now for France to talk, 
They speak of mediation, 
And Greeley does encourage them 
To meddle with our nation. 
It's the fashion of the Yankees to 
Beat every foreign foe, sir; 
And France may soon find out that fact, 
And run from Mexico, sir. 
It's the fashion now for dwarfs to wed, 
Now to that fact we come, sir; 
While other gals seek larger men„ 
Miss Warren takes her Thumb, sir. 
Soon, Barnum says, they'll children have 
(Of course they'll go and do it), 
And the first babe they have we'll want 
A microscope to view it. 
Epaulettes and gold lace now 
About the streets are flagbing; 
For officers to stay at home 
It seems to be the fashion. 
Now Stanton's got a 
curious plan,_ 
Our leaders to improve 'em: 
When a 
General gets his troops in trim, 
It's the fashion to remove him.

The house to keep clear, 
In a

Near Washington Square. 
Chorus. 
Oh, she was as beautiful as a 
butterfly! 
There's none could compare 
With pretty little Polly Perkins, 
Of Washington Square. 
Her eyes were as black 
As the pips of a 
pear; 
No rose in the garden 
With her cheeks could compare. 
Her hair hung in " ringerlets" 
So beautiful and long! 
I 
thought that she loved me, 
But found I 
was wrong. 
Oh, she was, etc. 
When I'd call in the morning, 
And cry " Meat!" below, 
At the sound of my voice 
Her face she would show, 
With a 
smile upon her countenance 
:And a 
laugh in her eye; 
If I 
thought she'd have loved me, 
I'd have laid down to die. 
Oh, she was, etc. 
When I 
asked her to marry me, 
She said, " Oh, what stuff!" 
And told me to drep it, 
For she'd had quite enough 
Of my' nonsense—at the same time 
I'd been very, kind, 
But to marry a 
butcher-boy 
She didn't feel inclined. 
Oh, she was, etc.

" 
Oh, the man that has me 
Must have silyer and gold— 
A chariot to ride in, 
And be handsome and bold; 
His hair must be curly 
As any watch-spring, 
And his whiskers as big 
As a 
brush for clothing." 
Oh, she was, etc. • 
The words that .she uttered 
Went straight through my heart; 
I 
sob-bed, I 
sigh-ed, 
And straight did depart, 
With a 
sear on my eyelid 
As big as a 
pear— 
Bidding good-by to Polly Perkins 
And Washington Square. 
Oh, she was, eto. 
In six months she married, 
This hard-hearted girl— 
It was not a 
viscount, 
It was not an earl, 
It was not a 
baronet— 
But worser by far: 
'Twas a 
bow-legged conductor 
Of a 
Third-Avenue car

WEEHAWKEN IS THE PLACE TO RURALIZE . 
There you can take a

Away from New- York fogs; 
Across the fields you scramble, 
Being mindful of the frogs. 
Chorus. 
Oh, Wee-haw-ken is the place to ruralize, 
Ri-ti-tu-ral-ize, ex-tra mu-ral-ize— 
Weehawken is the place to ruralize, 
On a 
summer's day. 
I 
joined a 
party of thirty-eight or more, 
Overcoats we wore, 'case the rain should pour; 
With baskets of nice cold meat a 
store, ' 
For a 
peckish day; 
While after us came tearing 
Per-am-bu-la-tors small,. 
Containing babes to share in 
Our pleasures by a 
squall. 
Oh, Weehawken is the place, etc. 
At the foot of the hill we stopped to bait a 
bit— 
Snack to take a 
bit, thirst•to slake a 
bit, 
But horse and stage for ug wouldn't wait a 
bit, 
Back down-hill made way. 
A pleasant place to find then 
We began to look around; 
The babies, who should mind them • 
When we got on the ground? 
Oh, Weehawken, etc. 
In a 
lager-bier garden we soon were mustering, 
Round tables flustering—some began blustering 
To find, tadpoles in our tea-cups clustering, 
Some had down our throats made way! 
The tea-pot, to pt fresh tea in, 
Finding tea-leaves such a 
load, 
Ye gods! what did we see in 
The dregs, but a 
large hop-toad? 
Oh, Weehawken, etc.

soon was slipping it, 
From toad-tea sipping it, o'er the hills tripping h, 
Something more to my humor was hitting it—.- 
'Twas a 
sweetheart young and gay: 
For the party no more caring, 
We homeward then did steer; 
How the others they were faring, 
We didn't stay to hear. 
Oh, Weehawken, etc. 
Should any now here wish to ruralize, 
Ri-ti-tu-ral-ize, ex-tra mu-ral-ize, 
Think how tadpoles in tea-cups pluralize 
On a 
summer's day. 
Beware of donkeys kicking, 
Or babies on your knees, 
Or toads in tea-pots sitting, 
Come to grief in cold tea-leaves. 
Oh, Weehawken, etc.

As 
sung by TONY PASTOR.. 
On, don't I 
know a 
pretty girl? 
Her name is Sally Higginbottom ; 
Don't she look a 
cherubin 
When all her Sunday best she's got on? 
Sally wears a 
crinoline, 
With falderals all round the bottom. 
The first time I 
saw Sally, 
Oh, by Cupid, I 
was struck I 
Chorus. 
Oh, my! she lodges at a 
sugar-shop; 
Oh, dear! I

TECE SUGAR-SEM 
When first I 
met Miss Higginbottom, 
I 
in Bleecker street was stalking, 
Looking at the bonnet- shops— 
I 
saw my pretty Sally walking: 
I 
looked at her, she looked at me, 
And after that we 'gan a- talking; 
She was so fascinating—oh, 
Quite silly I 
was struck! 
Oh, my! she lodges, etc. 
She was so fair, I 
do declare 
My love for her I 
couldn't smother; 
I 
told her so, and then she said 
She'd introduce me to her mother. 
How I 
jumped and kicked for joy, 
When she said she didn't love another! 
I 
felt inclined to kiss her, 
But I 
hadn't got the pluck. 
Oh, my! she lodges, etc. 
Her mother's got a 
mangle, 
And her biggest brother he's a 
baker; 
Sally dear herself she's 
An artificial-lidwer maker. 
I've proposed to Sally, 
And for worse or better I 
will take her; 
To marry such a 
charmer, 
Oh, I 
reckou Pm in luck! 
Oh, my! she lodges, etc. 
Sally's very fond of me, 
She's got a,temper sweet as honey; 
When she gives a 
look, 
Oh, it makes a 
fellow feel so funny! 
But, Sally's just like all the girls— 
She knows the way to spend the money. 
To find a 
girl that doesn't, 
Would be a 
lump of luck! 
Oh, my! she lodges, etc. 
TTM FINIGAN'S WAKE. 
I've arrived at the conclusion 
That quite long enough I've dilly-dallied; 
Sally she begins to think that 
Single long enough she's tarried. 
So, on Monday next, at ten o'clock, 
We're both a-going to got married— 
I 
wish it was to-morrow, 
For she's such a 
little duck. 
Oh, my! she lodges, etc.

I ALWAYS TAKE IT COOL. 
His friends assembled at his wake, 
Missus Finigan called out for the lunch; 
First they laid in tay and cake, 
Then pipes and tobaccy, and whiskey-punch. 
Miss Biddy O'Brien began to cry: 
"Sich a 
purty corpse did ever you see? 
Arrah! Tim avourneen, an' why did ye die?"— 
" 
Och, none o' yer gab!" says Judy Magee. 
Whack, hurrah, etc. 
Then Peggy O'Connor took up the job: 
"Arrah, Biddy," says she, " ye're wrong, I'm sure." 
But Judy then gave her a 
belt on the gob, 
And left her sprawling on the flure. 
Each side in the war did soon engage, 
'Twas woman to woman and man to man; 
Shillalah-law was all the rage, 
And a 
bloody ruction now began.

Mickey Mulvaney raised his head, 
When a 
gallon of whiskey flew at hir,n; 
It missed him, and, hopping on the bed, 
The liquor scattered over Tim! , 
Bedad, he revives! see how he raises! 
And Timothy. jumping from the bed, 
Cries, while he lathered around like blazes, 
"Bad luck till yer sowlsl d'ye think I'm dead?"

An Original Comic Song. 
As sung by TONY PASTOR. 
AIR—" Yankee Volunteers." 
Now just keep cool, and lend your ears, 
And listen to thy song; 
Though folks at first may think me green, 
I 
always get along. 
The reason why is very plain, 
For this I 
make a 
rule: 
While other folks get in a 
heat, 
I 
always take it cool. 
The other day, while walking out, 
"Stop thief!" I 
heard the cry; 
An excited crowd pursued a 
man, 
• 
And soon he passed me by. 
A 
nice gold watch he'd in his hand, 
He dropped it like a 
fool; 
When they'd gone past I 
picked it up, 
For I 
always take it •cool. 
Unto a 
ball I 
went one night— 
,Two fellows)raised a 
row, 
And soon they had a 
general fight; 
'Twas an awful time, I 
vow! • 
Hats, bonnets, shawls, and coats were lost, 
Confusion was the rule; 
I 
came out with a 
bran-new overcoat, 
For I 
always take it cool. 
One evening, going down Broadway 
(Remember that I 
shall), 
Two nice young men were pitching in— 
'Twas all about a 
gal; 
And while they went it right and left— 
Hard hitting was the rule— 
I 
took her arm and saw her home, 
For I 
always take it cool. 
I 
dropped in at a 
faro-bank, 
To see them play the game; 
When someone hollered out, " Police I" 
Then terror seized each frame. 
They all rushed off, like little boys 
Skedaddling out of school; 
I 
nabbed the stakes, and out I 
stepped, 
For I 
always take it cool

And eating up Old Uncle Sam in morsels bit by bit;

MY 
name is Paddy Ca-nes,

The divil a

The first time'I was breeched. 
When breeches I 
put on, 
The gossoons all did scan, 
Saying, " Pat, before yeti. mother, 
By dads! you'll be a 
man; 
You look so gay and purty • 
In your new suit well stitched!" 
And I 
thought myself a 
prince, boys, 
The first time I 
was breeched.

sang then, etc. 
And now I 
wear these clothes, 
The whiskey I 
can drink, 
The dudeen I 
can smoke, 
At thie 
girls, too, I 
can wink; 
I 
caper up and down like a 
pig, 
By me the twig is twitched, 
There's nothing comes amiss, boys, 
To Paddy since he's breeched. 
I 
sang then, etc. 
All wakes I

And that, faith, anyhow, 
I'm the first wid my shillalah

That Congress passed a

The treasury to fill: 
On goods and wares of every kind 
Tkey quickly placed a 
tax, 
But the dealers now the people beat, 
And that's the way they " acts." 
Chorus—But the dealers, etc. 
The hats are now five dollars each, 
That once were only four; 
For coats and vests the tailor, too, 
Will charge a 
dollar more. 
Even on grub you feel the tax— 
Now what a 
shame it is 
The butter-cakes are getting small, 
And codfish-balls have riz I 
The butter-cakes, etc. 
The gas- bills, too, are raised, I 
vow, 
Their profits up to keep; 
And topers can no longer take 
Their " nip" three fingers deep. 
Cigars have had the tax put on, . 
From cabbage to cheroots, 
And three cents more you'll have to pay, 
To the boy that blacks you boots.

Unless you pay an extra dime, 
He'll only shave one side! 
Unless you pay, etc. 
The laundress now won't wash your shirt 
Till you pay the tax on soap; 
And if you want to hang yourself,

THE DIAMOND RING. 
W ritten by JIMMY REYNOLDS. 
As 
sung by TONY PASTOR. 
Aix—" The Cove that spouts." 
I'LL tell you; in my song, of a 
gay young cavalier, 
Who once upon a 
time lived in this town, right here; 
His name was Charles Augustus,—so divinely he could 
Sing! 
He was a 
clerk in a 
dry-goods store, and he wore a 
dia-
mond ring. 
Chorus—lid.
di fol lol fol lol fol lol, 
Tidi fol lol fol la, etc. 
He wore a 
black mustache, his hair hung round in curls; 
Oh, he was the fellow to smash the unsuspecting girls! 
When they met him on the street, sly glances they would 
fling 
At this handsome ladies' man, for he wore a 
diamond ring. 
Tidi fol lol, etc. 
To parties he would go, and with the ladies flirt; 
"He's such .a charming beau!" the girls would all assert. 
He had plenty of cash on hand, and all that sort of thing, 
And he drove a 
two-forty horse, and Sported a 
diamond 
ring. 
Tidi fol lol, etc. 
Now things went on quite well—our hero cut a 
dash, 
Like many a 
dandy swell, with his employer's cash; 
But his salary was too small these luxuries to bring, 
But he had the run of the drawer, and he wore a 
diamond 
ring. 
Tidi fol lol, etc. 
At last suspicion arose, in his 'emplOyer's mind, 
That Charles Augustus' clothes were altogether too fine; 
So a 
watch was kept one day, to stop this sort of thing, 
,And our dry-goods clerk was caught coming this, with his 
diamond ring..

THE HOUSE THAT PAT BUILT. 
So our gay young cavalier before a 
court was tried, 
And as his case was clear, his guilt was not denied; 
They sent him, for his health, to the village of Sing Sing, 
To play chequers with his nose, without any diamond ring.

This house had doors and windows too, a 
chimney, and a 
thatch tilt, 
Wid up-stairs rooms on the ground floor, and this is the 
House that Pat built. 
Chorus—Ochl this is the House that Pat built. 
(Spoken.) And sure it was an illigant mansion, built all 
of mud and sticks, wid a 
snug piece of background in the 
front of the house; every pane of glass in the windows is 
wood; the very best straw made of deal shavings was the 
pan-tiles it was thatched wid; it was Pat's own freehold, 
held on lease from the lord of the manor. 
Ochl this is the House, etc. 
There's the praties, by some called spuds, of Pat's own 
garden growing, 
All rent and torn, you see the sacks, which to you I'm

ONE night in Chatham Square strolling was, 
Homeward rolling was, tho clock twelve tolling was, 
When just as myself consoling was, 
A strange girl spoke to me:

THE ANGEL DRESSED IN WHITE. 
That I 
would be excusing 
Of me begged so polite, 
I 
could not be refusing 
Such an angel dressed in white. 
Chorus. 
Beware of strange girls when you're meeting them, 
Don't be treating them, with smiles greeting them,. 
Nothing you'll find but deceit in them, 
Dressed in dark or white. 
She pressed me not to be forsaking her, 
No mistake in her !—I 
was taking her 
To a 
public house, to take wine making her— 
She did not refuse. 
While the wine was drinking, 
With her eyes so bright N. 
On me constant winking, 
Was the angel all in white.

Another angel soon was dropping in, 
Smiling hopping in, by accident dropping in, 
As her nurse asked to be stopping in, 
To show me her baby. 
The child smiled on me sweetly, 
It seemed delighted quite; 
'Twas dressed so very neatly, 
Like its ma— all in white! 
Beware of strange girls, etc. 
Of course a 
great fuss they were making it— 
No mistake in it, I 
must be taking it, 
The nurse so willingly forsaking it, 
Dropped it in my arms!

Though I 
cannot hear the surging billow, 
Nor see the waves as they roll high, 
I 
hear Tom-cats when on my pillow, 
In my garret near the sky— 
Yes, I 
often hear the cats moll-rowing, 
In my garret, in ray garret near the sky. 
I 
have no roses near my dwelling, 
No honeysuckles strew my bedroom-floor, 
But New-York smoke I'm always smelling, 
And squalls I 
hear from kids next door; 
The milkman's call it oft disturbs me, • 
And the cat's- meat man's voice ringing 
And the smoke it won't go up the chimbly,

snob, a 
lover of sweet peace 
and quiet, - 
Was annoyed by her termagant tongue, which was always • 
agog for a 
riot. 
Chorus. 
With her snapping, and snacking, and sneering, hands on 
hips, she would stoutly declare— 
" 
You shan't gag me, you old snob, for I'll have the last 
word, I 
swear!" • 
While Crispin was pegging away, her tongue it ran on, 
and double fast: 
First he thought he would give her a 
welting, and hammer 
away to the last; 
Cried he, " If you don't stop your clapper, and leave off 
this thundering coil, 
As sure as my name is Criss Snapper, I'll give you some 
strong stirrup-oil!"

ever was heard! 
For since you promised the parson, you never have °nee

Still her tongue ran nineteen to the dozen, and the poor 
snob came in for his share; 
Cried she, " If you talk me stone dumb, I'll have the last 
word, that. I 
swear!" 
So the snob one day, in a 
passion, swore he'd put an end 
to more strife—

Which the stupid servant-maid 
Put in my pocket by mistake 
For the gin !—with horror found, 
To poison her, me did accuse; 
To contradict it to the crowd around 
I 
tried—it was no use.

A doctor sent for, did arrive; 
He felt her pulse, exclaimed, " I

With a 
hey, Ito, hi diddle diddle! 
Her husband a 
fiddler was, so they say— 
You could hear him practise at home all day, 
And from home many hours he would be away, 
For all night long he'd play at the play 
A very fine tune on the fiddle. 
A good-looking policeman was there, you must know, 
With his long coat, staff; and his rattle; 
And says he, " I 
should like for to come for to go 
The fiddler's wife my bull's-eye to show, 
And to tell her the wind out my light did blow, 
And see if she's got any cold meat, you know, 
For that's the stuff I 
could tackle." 
So into the house he went off his beat, 
Did this hungry, buttoned-up glutton, 
And the fiddler's wife he then did greet; 
Says he, " It's some time since I've been in this street— 
Have you got such a 
thing as a 
bit of cold meat?" 
Then down by the fire he now took a 
seat, 
And she gave him a 
lump of cold mutton.

Says he, " Dearest creature, this mutton's divine, 
But I 
should like to wet my old throttle: 
I'd a 
herring for breakfast, it was salt as brine— 
It's regularly parched up, this gullet of mine." 
So she went to the cupboard and brought him some wino, 
And the bobby's eyes glistened and brightly did shine, 
As he eagerly collared the bottle. 
Says he, " Dearest angel, you are kind to me, 
And I 
love you the same as a 
brother; 
I 
wish from the fiddler you only was free, 
For all night long I 
am dreaming of thee." 
And the fiddler popped in, and there he did see 
FM wife sitting down on'the policeman's right knee— 
Oh, crikey! then there was a 
bother. 
The poor old fiddler with rage did cry, • 
"I thought you did only me cherish!"— 
And the wife Spoke up and said, " I'll tell you for why, 
He only came in to light his bull's-eye." 
But the fiddler said ' twas a 
villanous lie— 
" 
You may fiddle he, but you don't fiddle I, 
For all of us here shall perish!" 
Now the poor old fiddler was sadly cut up, 
To be robbed of his pride and his glory,. 
So he hanged himself with a 
piece of catgut, 
And the policeman his throat with his staff did cut; 
And as for her, the wicked young slut, 
She drowned herself in the pater-butt—

I 
am all the way there, and in truth, sirs, you'll find, 
While I'm going ahead, sure I'm never behind; 
I 
never use blarney wid age or wid youth— 
If I 
tell lies all day, sure every word's truth, 
Wid my double-milled laming, and shamrock so green. 
(Spoken.) And where did I 
lam it all? 
Sure from the 
mother-tongue of my father, who was a 
fine motherly 
man, but he had a 
knack of' growing, and he'd never lave 
it off: frOm a 
boy he grew into a 
young man, then he'd 
not lave it off; from a 
young man he grew into an old 
man, then he'd not lave it off; so for a 
change he grew 
dead one day, and thin he'd not lave it off; for he grew 
musty, and fusty, and rusty; so to keep him sweet above-
ground we put him under it, and by the powers he'd not 
lave off growing then, for the last time we dug him up he 
-wasn't there, for he had grown himself to waste: 
Ochl 
but he had a 
knack of getting over the boys and girls too, 
for on his table was laming and potatoes at the same time, 
and you were welcome to eat them all and lave the rest 
behind you. 
Och! sure, he had a 
most illigant brogue, 
and he laid his blarney on with a 
trowel, and this was the 
way of him: " Och 1" said he, " honor your fathers and 
mothers all the days of their lives, if they died before you 
were born. 
Keep your hands from picking and stealing, 
or if you do steal any thing mind it belongs to yoursilf. 
Niver spake ill of your neighbor widout giving him a 
good 
character. 
Keep your tongue from lying and slandering, 
unless you speak thruth all the time you are doing of it. 
Niver break your word widout keeping of it at the same 
time. 
Always honestly pay your debts whether you owe 
any or not. 
Niver borrow an article of a 
neighbor that he 
has not got to lend you, or you are likely to get disap-
pointed; by the same rule niver lind an article that you 
have not got; if you do, you will niver get it back again. 
Niver try to keep an empty sieve full of wather, or at-
tempt to bottle off the wind, or run afther a 
flash of light-
ning. But there are some people who are so disagreeable, 
that they are niver quiet but when they are kicking up a 
row, and niver satisfied but when they are discontinted. 
Now such people should go to some uninhabited, unknown 
country which they•can't find out, and not let their frinds 
know where to find them. 
Thin, when they were all 
alone, like Adam and Eve were in the garden of St. Ste-
phen, if they should have a 
row wid their next-door neigh-
bor, to save peace and quietness, and prevent blows, box 
it out wid them." 
This is the way me father taught me, 
and thus I

THE PROPEREST THING TO DO. 
. • 
As sung by TONY PASTOR. 
Ain—" The Spider and the Fly." 
ONE morning my wife said, " Johnson deaf, 
Come early home. I 
pray, 
Because the darling Babicums 
Is two years old to-day; 
And I've invited mother, 
And dear old Airs. Brown." 
Said I, " That's most unlucky, dear, 
For I'm going out of town." . 
Chorus. 
So will you, will you, will you, 
Will you tell me true— 
Don't you really think it was 
The properest thing to do? 
Now my wife began to grumble, 
And to look a 
little blue; 
But I 
said, " Particular business, dear— 
Must be attended to." 
I 
left the house all right enough, 
As jolly as ever could be, 
And I 
said to myself, " As that's settled all right, 
I'm blest if I 
don't have a 
spree 1" 
So will you, etc. 
I 
jumped into an omnibus 
That moment passing by, 
And sat opposite a 
pretty girl, 
Who giggled at me so sly. 
T 
caught a 
sight of her dear little foot, 
And somehow—I 
hardly know— 
But I 
found that I 
was actually-
Treading upon her toe. 
So will you, etc. 
That she was game for a 
bit of spree 
I 
saw at half a 
glimpse; 
So I 
said, " Let's go to Hoboken, 
And I'll treat you to tea and shrimps." 
She said, " Thankee, sir, I 
will, sir;" 
And as down the pier we ran, 
I 
popped my arm around her waist, 
And felt like a 
single man. 
So will you, etc. 
We soon got o'er to Hoboken, 
The hours onward rolled; 
We danced upon the platform, 
And we had our fortunes told: 
We'd seen almost every thing, 
When she said, with a 
dear little gaze, 
"0 Mister Fitzplantagenet, 
Let's go for a 
lark in the maze." 
So will you, etc'. 
No sooner said than off we went, 
And into the maze did go; 
Said I 
to myself, " Now, Tim, be firm, 
No larking liere, you know." 
Says she, " I 
think I'm going to faint, 
I 
feel such pet uliar qualms; 
Oh dear, oh dear. I 
feel no queer"— 
And I 
caught her right in my arms! 
So will you, etc. 
64 
THE PROPEREST TEPING TO DO. 
I 
cut her strings, and called for help 
As loud as I 
could roar— 
When the first to rush upon the scene 
Was my old mother-in-law! 
When after her came Mrs. Brown, 
I 
scarce knew what I 
did, 
For she was followed up (oh, my eye!) 
By my blessed wife anditid I 
So will you, etc. 
I 
knocked down all the bushes, egad I 
And rushed slap out of the grounds, 
The women all yelping after me 
Just like a 
pack of hounds. 
My mother-in-law, tucked her petticoats up,. 
And chevied me like an old witch,. 
And run me down in a 
mile and a 
half, 
As I 
tumbled right into a 
ditch! 
So will you, etc. 
Mrs. Brown she lugged me out of the ditch, 
My wife and the girl had a 
fight, sir; 
A. Bobby came up, and he took us all in charge, 
And locked us all up for the night, sir. 
So there was an end of my little go-out— 
And, gentlemen, mind when you go, 
In a 
cab, or a 
train, or an omnibus, 
Don't tread on a 
pretty girl's toe. 
For if your babicum's two years old, 
And your wife should say to you, 
Stop at home and nurse the kid"— 
It's the properest thing to do! 
.So will you, etc.

OH& GRANDFATHERS' DAYS. 
OUR GRANDFATHERS' 
DAYS. 
W ritten by JOHN F. 
POOLE. 
Originally sung by TONY PASTOR. 
A SONG for to please all my kind friends before me, 
I've been thinking of late a 
new subject to raise, 
And one I 
have got, and I 
know it will please you— 
I 
am going to sing of our grandfathers' days. 
In our grandfathers' days men were judged but by merit, 
And those who were sound got their measure of praise; 
But now-a-days folks judge of men by their money— 
. That wasn't the case in our grandfathers' days. 
In. our grandfathers' days they had no patent leathers, 
• 
Gatotte choking-collars, nor no peg-top pants; 
Young men didn't go It with two- forty horses, 
• 
Or visit young ladies at night at their aunt's. 
The boys didn't then congregate on the corners , 
To see the gals crossing on wet, slushy days, 
Nor the gals didn't want a 
policeman to help theta— 
That wasn't the style in our grandfathers' days. 
In our grandfathers' days billiard-markers ne'er sported 
Mustache on their lips or goatees on their chins, 
Nor did sixpenny barbers drive out in light wagons, 
Nor did tishball-waiters wear diamond pins. 
The gals didn't paint, stuff themselves up with cottog, 
They didn't wear hoops, patent bustles or stays, 
Didn't smoke cigarettes, or drink cocktails at Taylor's— 
That wasn't the style in our grandfathers' days. 
In our grandfathers' days married men they were steady, 
You'd not find them out every day of their lives, 
Nor see them out late walking home with their cousins— 
They always retired in good time to their wives. 
They had no champagne suppers, no little flirtations, 
No trying to go it in various ways; 
Didn't stop in saloons with a 
female acquaintance— 
They had no waiter-girls in our grandfathers' days.

THE BROADWAY POLICEMAN. 
In our grandfathers' daysiwhen a 
man ran for office. 
He did it alone for the national good, 
And not for the dollars and cents he might pocket— 
That is something that now- a-days ain't understood. 
The government then was for wisdom selected, 
Rebellion had not set the country ablaze; 
But the people have sworn that our flag shall float over 
The Union as ' twas in our grandfathers' days!

I'm a

My father was a 
left-handed wiper, 
And music knocked out of my head. 
I 
made a 
drum out of a

From the bellows I 
made a 
trombone; 
My pipes cure the ill, who look gladder, 
When they hear out their musical sound. 
Chdru<9. 
ilurrah, then, for Jerry the piper, 
Who Jul/len and others outshine; 
I 
can put aside every French viper 
Wid these illigant bagpipes o' mine! 
My mother said, " Sure, it would be a 
riddle 
If I 
couldn't blow the big drum ;" 
My father said, " I 
should tale to the Oddle, 
He could tell by my finger and thumb." 
My grandfather said, " Now, to convince you, 
Look! how he shoves grub in his tripes— 
I 
know where his talent does lay, sure," 
So he gave me these beautiful pipes. 
Hurrah, then, etc. 
Things now went on mighty pleasant; 
Whether dance, at wake, or at fair, 
Both I 
and my pipes must be present, 
To play up some ould Irish air. 
The Queen sent for me, and I 
went, sir; 
My performance struck dumb all the court, 
As the notes I 
brought from my pipes, sir, 
Were delicious—whether piano or forte.

Now I 
hadn't been to my roost long, 
Before the captain came—" Hoy, hoyi 
If you're in a

Get up, you Ned, my boy I" 
So out of my roost I 
rolled, 
And followed the gay old shark; 
Like a

In the passage—all in the dark. 
Tidy idy, etc. 
To the chamber-door soon got, 
Which happened to be a-jar: . 
"To the keyhole peep your eye, 
If you're a

did, and there I 
saw 
Six lovely-looking shes, 
And my intended bride— 
In her chemise—catching fleas. 
Tidy idy, etc. 
I 
still kept gazing on, 
And admiring of the fun, 
And. opening of the door, 
And counting them one by one; 
When the captain, from behind— 
Though one of the best of pals— 
Pitched me headlong into the room, 
Undressed, among the gals.

Or, Dearly You must pay for your Mutton. 
As sung by TONY PASTOR. 
A is—" Y ankee Volunteers." 
As an Englishman, an Irishman, 
And a 
Scotehman, too, one day, 
Were going along together, 
And one of them did say— 
" 
We are all very hungry, 
And I 
see, on yonder hill, 
A lot of little baellambs, 
Let's take one and have a 
fill." 
The notion was agreed on— 
To the fields they went together; 
There being a 
lot to choose from, 
They picked a 
fine wether. 
One held the head, the other the legs, 
The other drew his knife; 
To keep them three from starving, 
They took away his life. 
They soon made up a 
fire, 
And the sheep began to cook; 
They were only after eating it, 
When the farmer the whole lot took. 
Says he, " For this you shall dearly pay, 
For cutting that sheep's wizen!" 
So like a. 
shot he caught the lot, 
And whacked them off to prison. 
Next day before the old judge 
The whole of them was took; 
The jury found them " Guilty," 
And the judge looked into a 
book— 
Said he, " This is a

Written an sung by T

Atn—" What'll you take to drink?" 
T HE young men now are all deranged, 
'Bout one thing and the other; 
Their minds are all affected, 
Which keeps them in a 
bother. 
Now should you ask the cause of this, 
My answer's very plain: 
There's an epidemic flying round— 
An affection of the brain. 
To-day, while walking in the street, 
I saw a 
crowd of men 
Rush in and out of drinking- shops, 
The poor and " upper ten." • 
A fellow staggered up to me— 
Says he, " I'm drunk again." 
Says I, " Friend, that's a 
grand mistake, 
You've got whiskey on the brain." 
When walking round the city here, 
You'll think it very strange 
To see so many brokers 
With signs hung out, " Exchange." 
But if you step within the door, 
A 
curious crowd is seen, 
With bits of paper in their hands= 
They've got " policy" on the brain. 
Now when you see a 
dismal cove 
With a 
sanctimonious look, 
Who makes abolition speeches, 
And sparks the colored cook— 
When you see a 
man like this 
(Now mark, I'm speaking plain), 
Make up your mind he's got it bad— 
Nigger on the brain!

Where we lay in a

I 
kno-d I 
then looked blue, 
But before she answered, I 
said, " Sir, 
What's that to do with you?" 
Says I, " This is my Sal, 
And stick to her I 
shall; 
Go and get another cousin, sir, 
Or any other gall" 
You may judge of my astonishment, 
When Sal she left my arm, 
And took hold of her cousin's, 
Which I 
thought was rather warm. 
Says I, " Sal, what Wye mean by this?" 
says she, " Don't be a 
fool!" 
"It's all right," said her cousin— 
" 
My dear sir, take it cool." 
I 
felt jnclined to strike him, 
But he was so jolly tall, 
And I 
felt at that moment 
So particularly small! 
"This is an old acquaintance 
Of mine," says faithless Sal, 
"For you really are too tame for me, 
Or any other gal." 
I 
could scarce believe my ears, 
And stood rooted on the spot, 
At such a 
cool proceeding— 
My brain was burning hot. 
They walked off arm-in-arm,

What course I 
should pursue. 
I 
thought I'd take a 
drop, 
My misery to drown; 
But instead of spirits keeping me uip, 
I 
frequently tumbled down. 
I 
passed that night in a 
police-cell, 
Forget it I 
never shall; 
And I'll never love another being,

Or any other gal..

I—WILL YOU BUY ? 
• 
As sung by TONY Palma. 
THERE was a 
butcher-boy, boy, boy, 
Who a 
girl did much annoy-noy-noy, 
By winking at her his eye; 
And whenever she came to his shop 
To purchase a 
steak or a 
nice loin chop, 
Who 
cried, " Beef, pork, mutton, will you buy, buy, buy?" 
Chorus—Beef, pork, etc. 
He love for her did feel, feel, feel, 
Which love he did re-vEAE, veal, veal, 
And heaved full many a 
sigh; 
Then falling down upon his knees, 
Her hand with rapture he did seize, 
And cried, " Beef, pork, mutton, will you buy, buy, buy ?" 
Now a 
smart young brother had she, she, she, 
Who had lately come from sea, sea, seas 
Where he did the waves defy: 
He his sister embraced without delay, 
Unto the butcher's great dismay, 
Who cried, " Beef, pork, mutton, will you buy, buy, buy?' 
He did not know 'twas her brother, brother, brother. 
But thought of lovers 'twas another-nother-nother, 
So fate he did defy,

And walked up to the sailor, who gave him a 
frown: 
But instead of directly knocking him down, 
He cried, " Beef, pork, mutton, will you buy, buy, buy?" 
Then the butcher he whetted his knife, knife, knife, 
Resolved to take the life, life, life, 
Of this treacherous girl so sly; 
So by the hair he caught the maid, 
And, after flourishing his blade, 
He cried, " Beef; pork, mutton, who will buy, buy, buy ?" 
The 'sailor coming in—like a 
brick, brick, brick, 
Saluted the butcher with a 
kick, kick, kick, 
That lifted him three feet high; 
And when recovered from the shock, 
He directly rat ebehind his block, 
And cried, " Beef, pork, mutton, will you buy, buy, buy ?" 
Thus being bereft of hope, hope, hope, 
He went and bought a 
rope, rope, rope, 
Resolved that he would die; 
But she all explained, and became his bride— 
So, instead of committing suicide, \ 
He still cries, " Beef; pork, mutton, will you buy, buy, 
buy ?"

Getting tired of the ball, I

And various streets I

At " a

stopped for a 
while, 
Saw a

dance.

jolly old salt mackerel dancing a

As I 
went farther on, I 
heard a 
great noise, 
And got into a 
room full of girls and boys; 
They were all " going in" in a 
rale Irish jig— 
'Twas a 
raffle and a 
ball for the Widow O'Gig. 
(Spoken.) Imitation of Mrs. McGuffin dancing the Planxty 
O'Rafferty on a " windy-shutther." 
[Gives imitation—Irish reel.] 
Such a 
cutting, etc. 
It was now break of day—I 
could see no more, 
So I 
took another drink, and staggered off to the store 
I'd a 
fight with the boss just as soon as he'd come, 
So I 
got my discharge, and went dancing home.
