THEIR DIAMOND RING. 
SONG AND DANCE. 
Written by SAUL SERTREw. 
Air—" Hildebrand Montrose." 
I 
like to sing, I 
like to dance, 
And when the music's playing, 
I'm happy as a 
big sea gull, 
All on the wing a 
sailing. 
And I'm so fascinating, 
Oh, when this foot I 
swing, 
The girls all call me " Si,veetnesst," 
And their darling " Diamond Ring." 
CtioRus. 
It's nice—it's gay, 
It's re-sher-sha," 
And music has such charms, 
Oh, it makes me feel so gay. 
I 
am so fascinating, 
When this foot I 
fling, 
The girls all call me " Sweetness,"-
Their darling " Diamond Ring." 
(Law.) 
I 
get invited out to dine, 
And at the balls and parties, 
I'm honored as the special guest 
Of the Murphies and McCarties. 
And in the latest waltzes, 
Oh, when this foot I 
sling, 
The girls go into ecstacies, 
And call me thick " Diamond Ring. 
It's nice, etc.

DANCING ALL THE TIME. 
SONG AND DANCE. 
Written by SAUL SERTREW. 
I'm light as a 
cork, I'm happy and gay; 
On the heel- tap I 
conic, just to pass time away. 
Oh, Pm happy-go-lucky, all day, you see, 
The merriest darkey that ever could be. 
I 
charm all the fair sex, I 
make their beaux frown; 
My heel makes the music just where it conies down. 
Oh, I 
feel like a 
grasshopper, nimble and gay. 
And dancing just carries this darkey's way. 
CHORUS. 
Dancing all the time! 
Dancing all the time! 
On the light fantastic toe, I'm dancing all the time. 
Dancing all the time! 
Dancing all the time! 
Trouble never troubles me, I'm dancing all the time. 
(Bowe.) 
Old trouble may come, I'll let him alone; 
He's a 
bad friend, I'm sure, for a 
fellow to own ; 
Oh, the twist of the grape-vine is just my Style. 
It makes a 
man happy most all the while. 
'Way down in the ball-room I 
make the folks stare, 
For fun and for frolic, you'll find I 
am there. 
So wherever I 
go, if there's fun to be found, 
If you keep your eye open, you'll find me around. 
Dancing all the time, etc. 
MY EASY STYLE. 
ORIGINAL SONG AND DANCE, 
Sung with great success by the Milanese Minstrel, CHARLES 
DIAMOND. 
Oh, you've heard aqout my dancing, 
And easy style and grace; 
The girls are always glancing, 
With a 
smile upon my face. 
Just watch me now, you'll not regret, 
For staying a 
little while, 
I'll please you all, and again you'll call, 
When you see my easy style. 
CHORUS. 
Just watch my easy style, 
(Break.) 
For I 
make the ladies smile, 
(Break.) 
So just now pay attention 
To my quiet and easy style. 
I 
spend my time so happy, 
Down in the fields and flowers, 
In singing, dancing, all day long, 
I 
enjoy such pleasant hours. 
So now good night to one and all, 
May you all now wear a 
smile, 
And give me a 
welcome every time, 
When you see my easy style. 
;fist watch, etc. 
AT IT AGAIN. 
Original Comic Song. 
Written, composed. and sung with 
terrific success by FRED. J. 
MACKLEY. 
Through a 
very queer saying I 
oft have to smile; 
I'll tell you a 
strange one the time to beguile. 
When I 
first went a 
courting, the dear one to woo, 
I'd call her such pet names like us fellows do, 
We'd have lots of fun, I 
would play and she sing, 
And talk of the future and what it would bring. 
Then when I 
on parting a 
kiss strived to gain, 
I'd hear her pa's voice yell—" You're at it again." 
CHORUS. 
At it again ! 
At it again ! 
You ought to know better. 
Your acting insane. 
At it again ? 
At it again! 
Why don't you stop it? 
You're at it again ! 
one night I 
stayed late, as the old man had retired, 
And moonlight love-making she said she admired. 
Said I, " Now, my darling, just give me one kiss:" 
And in trying to reach her I 
made a 
sad miss. 
For I 
upset the table, She gave a 
loud scream, 
Which soon awoke the old man out of his dream, 
Who seized his revolver, and down stairs he came, 
Yelled " That wicked old Torn cat's broke something 
again." 
At it again, etc. 
In peace and contentment I 
pass my time away ; 
I 
married my Nellie so handsome and gay. 
We have lots of fun, in our house near the Park, 
And her father comes there With the same old remark. 
But the last time he came, now imagine his joy, 
He found he was grandpa to a 
girl and a 
boy. 
He winked at my wife, and said, " Now, it's plain, 
The babies are beauties, and they're laughing again."

BLUE EYED KATIE GRAY, 
ARTISTIC SONG AND DANCE. 
Written by BEN COLLINS. 
You must know- my heart 's 
been stolen, 
By a 
darling fond and true, 
A 
lily fair with golden hair, 
And cheeks carnation hue. 
She's the neatest, sweetest in the land, 
So handsome, tall and gay, 
She is my heart's sole treasure, 
Is my blue-eyed Katie Gray. 
CHORUS. 
And I 
love this little charmer like mm- life, (Brealc) 
And I'll soon go back and take her for my wife, (Break.) 
Her eyes they are as bright as the dew 
Of the flowers that bloom in May; 
The only girl I 
ever loved 
Is blue-eyed Katie Gray. 
can't forget the day I 
went, 
This pretty maiden fair, 
In the land where sweet magnolias grow-, 
How happy we were there. 
A lovely evening in July, 
'Mid flowers I 
did stray; 
'Twas there I 
met this angel, she's 
My blue-eyed Katie Gray. 
Dance. 
And I 
love, etc. 
The moon was shining sweetly. 
And threw beauty all around. 
asked if I 
might see her home, 
She blushed and then looked down; 
She whispered " Yes ;" I 
took her arm. 
And says, " Now don't say nay," 
She promised then to be my wife, 
My blue-eyed Katie Gray. 
And I 
love, etc, 
SONG AND DANCE. 
'Twas going to the Central Park, 
To take the country air, 
And see the fishes and the swans, 
And other sights so rare, 
I 
met a 
pair of roguish eyes, 
That pierced me through and through, 
And made me feel so very queer, 
I 
scarce knew what to do. 
CHORUS. 
She was all the heart could fancy, 
And lovely as a 
queen, 
And just about the gayest of the gay ; 
And it was her pair of roguish eyes, 
That pierced me thro' and thro' and thro' 
And charmed my heart and senses all away. 
(Dance.) 
Tier dress was made in the latest style, 
And trimmed with charming taste, 
She wore a 
brilliant necklace, too, 
Of diamonds—made of paste; 
Tier golden hair in ringlets fell, 
Around her lovely neck, 
And since her charming face I've seen, 
My heart's a 
perfect wreck. 
She was all, etc. 
POOR LITTLE JOE, 
Written and sung by Mr FRED J. 
MACKLEY. 
Dedicated to Mr. HARRY FIELDING. 
While strolling one night through the city's gay throng, 
I 
met a 
poor boy who was singing a 
song; 
Although he was singing, he wanted for bread, 
Although he was smiling, he wished himself dead. 
spoke to this poor boy out in the snow, 
he'd no place of shelter, nor nowhere to go; 
No mother to guide him—in the cold grave laid low, 
Cast on this cold world was poor little Joe. 
CHORUS. 
Cold blew the blast and down came the snow, 
No place of shelter, and nowhere to go; 
No mother to guide him— in the cold grave laid low, 
Cast on this cruel world was poor little .Toe. 
The lights had gone out, and the clock had struck one, 
When home came a 
policeman whose duty was done; 
And it seemed by the tramp of his dull heavy tread, 
As though he was seeking the dying or dead. 
"Oh, what is is this?" the policeman then said, 
It was poor little Joe—on the steps he laid dead; 
With his face turned to heaven all covered with snow, 
Dead in the cold streets laid poor little Joe. 
Don't talk of new sensations, 
For rill sine I 
take the lead. 
And ere fin done most everyone, 
Will say nit right indeed ; 
Just watch me for a 
moment 
And your sorrows I'll beguile, 
ill try my hest to please you with 
Aly own fantastic style.

And it never seems a

I'm always fond of music. 
I

I

To all this happy throng; 
I 
am different from every one, 
So just listen for awhile, 
And I'll show von something neater,

Watch the motion, etc. 
I 
do not sing of beauties, 
But I'll leave it all to you.

As the motion of my shoe?

You can travel mile and mile, 
And you'll find I've not an equal

SWEET SIXTEEN, 
SONG AND DANCE. 
Written by SAUL SERTREW. 
The first time that I 
sell in love 
I 
never shall forget; 
My heart was pierc'd right thro' and thro% 
Just like a 
flageolet. 
The gal I 
loved she was a 
blonde, 
The sweetest ever seen; 
She'd sky-blue eyes and rose-bud cheeks, 
And only sweet sixteen. 
Oh, my! oh, dear! 
Myself I've never been, 
Since I 
fell in love with that charming girl, 
Of only sweet sixteen. 
(Danre.) 
I 
took her out to see the sights, 
And cut a 
swell and dash; 
She said she was her daddy's heir, 
And sure to get his cash. 
But things they took a 
chequered course, 
Just when I 
thought she'd wed; 
She fell in love with a 
Chinaman, 
And married him instead. 
Oh, my! etc.

To roam in a 
terrible plight, 
Poor Duffy lives now on free lunches, 
Since he gave his grand opening night.

BRIGHT BLUE EYES. 
As sung by CHARLES DIAMOND. 
There's a 
pretty girl in this town. 
And Nellie, that's her name; 
She's as pretty as a 
picture, 
And I've got her on the brain. 
When first I 
saw this damsel, 
My heart enraptured was; 
Now I 
will tell you the reason. 
Those blue eyes were the cause. 
CHORUS. 
Bright blue eyes, 
They pierced me through and through, 
My pretty little Nellie, 
I 
love no one but you. 
Bright blue eyes, 
They pierced me through and through; 
My pretty littre gellie,

I'm going to tall this evening, 
And see this pretty girl, 
And I'll ask her if she'll wed me, 
For my brain is in a

Or well again in life, 
Unless this little beauty 
Consents to be my wife.

MIGNONNETTE, 
SONG' AND DANCE. 
Written hy DICK ANDERSON, of ANDERSON A MURRAY. 
There's a 
charming little creature in this city. 
Whom some day I 
fondly hope to make my wife; 
She is young, she is handsome, she is pretty, 
And she is the joy and comfort of my life. 
You might travel the country up and down. 
Such a 
beauty I 
am sure you'd never get; 
For there is no other maiden in the town. 
To compare with my bright-eyed Mignonnette. 
CHORUS. 
She is sweeter than the flower I 
named her after, 
And the music of her voice I 
can't forget; 
There's the sweetest music in the merry laughter 
Of my pretty little bright-eyed Mignonnette. 
Oh, you ought to see this dainty little creature. 
Whose style and grace is fitted for a 
queen; 
Supremely handsome is her every feature, 
She a " stunner," and she's only seventeen. 
I 
wish I 
could describe to you my darling, 
As she appeared to me when first we met; 
Her face was like a 
tiny flower garden, 
And that is why I 
called her Mignonnette.

I 
KNEW THAT I 
WAS DREAMING. 
Written and composed by FRED ALBERT. 
Music published by B. 
H. }LARDING, 229 Bowery. 
Price 10 
cents. 
Dreams are the strangest things in life, 
So fanciful, yet real, 
Sometimes depicting scenes of strife, 
In others they reveal 
Such happiness, that were it not 
Some sign the spell was breaking, 
That we were sleeping we'd forget, 
And fancy we were waking. 
Some strange dreams I 
have had of late, 
My brain with thoughts been teeming, 
And if you'll listen I 
will state 
What I've seen when I've been dreaming. 
dreamt I 
saw a 
race- course, 
And a 
crowd assembled there, 
To watch each noble race-horse. 
As towards the post they tear; 
I 
dreamt there was no welching— 
But all were acting fair, 
And I 
thought there was no filching, 
Or card sharping I 
declare. 
Well soon the race did begin, 
The colors they were streaming, 
And I 
thought each jockey tried to win— 
Then I 
knew I 
must he dreaming. 
I 
dreamt I 
saw a 
postman, 
Who was hurrying on his rounds, 
Of letters he'd a 
host, man, 
And so nimbly on he bounds; 
I 
thought it just struck eight o'clock, 
The maid the steps was cleaning, 
And I 
thought he gave a 
gentle knock, 
Then I 
knew I 
must be dreaming. 
He was so curiously arrayed, 
The buttons bright were gleaming, 
Then some one said he was well paid, 
Then I 
knew 1 
must be dreaming. 
I 
dreamt I 
saw an area gate, 
And a 
bobby standing near, 
A servant maid with mincing gait, 
Come forth to fetch some beer; 
I 
saw him kiss her on the sly, 
So life-like it was seeming, 
But when he refused some rabbit pie— 
Then I 
knew I 
must be dreaming. 
A row commenced close by there, when 
For police they loud were screaming, 
He came when he was wanted, 
Then I 
knew I 
must be dreaming. 
I 
dreamt I 
saw a 
music hall, 
And a 
waiter on his way, 
To serve some gent within the stalls, 
With something on a 
tray; 
I 
saw him hand politely 
The glass with liquor streaming, 
But he weut away without the fee, 
Then I 
knew I 
must be dreaming. 
I 
thought that every comic song 
Was full of wit and meaning, 
I 
felt convinced that I 
was wrong— 
And knew I 
must be dreaming.

Niriber forty, waiter, hurry. 
Bring me quickly Venve Clicquot. 
SPoKEN.—And, waiter, you ought to know that I 
always 
drink— 
Clicquot, etc. 
When we drive down to the rtes, 
Perhaps we do, folks often do, 
Then of course we pull long faces, 
As the numbers come in viEw; 
But I 
soon dispel the damper, 
Joy usurps the place of woe, 
When I 
pull out from the hamper 
Brilliant, sparkling, gay Clicquot. 
SPOKEN.—And I 
say to them all, never trust to horses 
but lay all your money out on— 
Cliequot, etc. 
• 
again, 
At a 
picnic, though the custard 
Gets mixed up with pigeon pie, 
Tho' the tarts be full of mustard, 
Is the wine all right? I 
cry; 
Clicquot quickly makes us jolly, 
Lovely eyes still brighter grow, 
Who would then be melancholy— 
Fascinating bright Clicquot. 
SPOKEN.—And what a 
splendid opportunity to pop the ques-
tion, amid the popping of corks; 
and, if you don't know what 
to say, whisper in her ear— 
Clicquot, etc. 
Should I 
wake up in the morning, 
Wondering how I 
got to bed, 
Choicest food at breakfast scorning, 
Feeling boiled about the head; 
Then I 
call for my restorer, 
And I 
drink—whilst bubbles glow— 
To the widow, I 
adore her, 
And her wine— the bright Clicquot. 
Clicquot, etc. 
GEORGE CONSTANTINE McKEOWN. 
Written and composed by Ton CANNON. 
A dandy and a 
ladies' man has come before you now, 
A man of taste and culture, for ' tis written on my brow: 
In Irish circles I'm the pet of all the ladies fair, 
And I 
always meet with favor and a 
hearty welcome there. 
The reason must be obvious, I 
don't make use of slang, 
I 
use well chosen language, which surprises all the gang, 
You'h often hear the ladies say, " Now hasn't he the tone ? 
He ought to be a 
counsellor, Ekeorg,e Constantine McKeown." 
I'm in the book and picture trade, I 
canvass every day, 
And tho' the times are very hard, I 
always make it pay; 
The literature of Ireland I 
have at my command. 
And when I'm talking up a 
trade my style is great and grand, 
I 
tell them how brave Sarsfield fought and kept the foe at bay. 
And how the women held the fort at Limenck town that day; 
I 
get them all excited, for I 
am no dunce or drone, 
You'll hear them cry " I'll take four books, George Constantine 
McKeown." 
You ought to hear me make a 
speech, about election time, 
I 
overflow with eloquence, with anecdote, with rhyme; 
My attitudes are picturesque, and I 
can plainly show 
That I'm the Irish orator, the Celtic " Cicero." 
Some try to imitate me, but their slow attempts are vile, 
They cannot catch my lofty tone, my grand imperious style; 
Let spurious imitators fall, for equals I 
have none. 
I 
am the great original George Constantine McKeown.

KNOW WHEN I'VE ENOUGH.

Music published by E.

H ARDING, 229 Bowery. 
Price it 
cents. 
Now don't go giving me advice, I 
know what I'm about, 
I 
am not going to make a 
speech, to drive the people out; 
I'm simply going to sing a 
song, to show that I 
am straight, 
My friends here tell me I am drunk, and say " it's growing 
late." 
Well, they may go, but I'm content to stay just where I 
am, 
When I 
get drunk I 
always go as mildly as a 
lamb; 
But first, allow me to declare that what they say is stuff, 
I 
never get off my lea-base, I 
know when I've enough. 
My wife tried to convince me once, that I 
was beastly tight, 
Of course I 
had been smiling, boys, as I 
have been to- night, 
I 
tried to reason with her, but she said I 
was a 
brute, 
I 
saw a 
storm was brewing, so, says I. " Old boy, keep mute !" 
My wife has got a lightning tongue—some of you smile, I 
see; 
Perhaps that some of you, to- night, are in the boat with me; 
Her arguments are striking ones, and I'm not over tough, 
Said I " My dear, I'll go to bed, I 
know when I've enough !" 
A big policeman t'other night was going to take me in, 
Says I, '• What for?" says he, " Because, you bum, you're full 
of gin !" 
I 
stood up on my dignity and tried to give him bluff, 
He clubbed me 
till I 
cried, in pain " I 
know when I've enough!" 
I 
now submit my case to you, and hope you will agree 
I 
never get chock-full, although I 
like a 
little spree; 
Don't ask me now to take a 
drink, although it's rather rough 
To decline a friendly smile, but then, " I 
know when I've 
enough !''

LA.CKAWANNA GANG. 
As sung by KONOLLMAN and RITTIE with great success. 
Also 
sung by CONROY and MURPHY nightly. 
Here we are, two " Latizawanna Spooners :" 
While we're here keep your eyes upon us; 
We load coal from Harlem to Gowanus, 
We're the two selected " Spooners of tile Gang." 
When we go home our family we embrace; 
We eat our meals with elegance and grace; 
For opposition shovellers we long to have a 
race; 
We're the two selected " Spooners of the Gang," 
CHORUS. 
As through the streets we walk along like soldiers, 
And baskets and shovels we have upon our shoulders; 
For to get a 
job there's none can be bolder, 
Than the two selected " Spooners of the Gang." 
(Chorus repeated.) 
On Saturday nights we stand upon the corners, 
Along with the gang that wears the Roll of Honor 
At Hibernian Hall we're going to raise a 
banner, 
To represent the " Lackawanna Gang." 
We all get shaved in the one barber shop, 
We use the same razor, lather brush, and cup, 
For Bay Rum and Tonic we long to have a 
sup, 
To stimulate the " Lackawanna Gang." 
As through, etc. 
We've accumulated wealth with hard work and endurance; 
With other scallawags we have no interference: 
We have been hard tried by work and perseverance, 
The two selected " Spooners of the Gang." 
With the "General Committee" we are two great big cards, 
Like "Muldoon, the Solid Man," we hold a 
grip in the ward, 
We 
coulu put you on the Pipes or the City Boulevard, 
The two selected " Spooners of the Gang." 
As through, etc.

Oh! we've parted from each other, 
And our dream of love is o'er, 
That bright dream was too beautiful to last 
And we'll meet as only strangers, 
In the future evermore, 
Our once tender love is buried in the past. 
Tho' I've tried to bear the blow, 
Without sighs or bitter tears, 
And tried to smile when my heart ached with pain. 
Yet the burning tears would tall. 
In spite of all that I

For the darling one I

LOG CABIN. 
sung by BILLY and M AGGIE RAT. 
I AM 
getting old and feeble now, I 
cannot work no wore, 
have laid the rusty-bladed hoe to rest, 
C.,Id Massa and old Missus they're sleeping side by side, 
And their spirits are now roaming with the blest; 
Things are changed about the place, the darkies all am gone, 
And I 
cannot hear them singing in the cane, 
And the only friend that's left me is that little boy of mine, 
In my little old log cabin in the lane. 
There was a 
happy time to me not many years go, 
When the darkies used to gather round the door, 
They used to sing and dance at night, and play the old banjt., 
But alas, they cannot do it any more; 
The hinges are all rusty now, the door is tumbling down, 
And the roof lets in the sunshine and the rain, 
Oh! the only friend that's left me is that little boy of mine, 
In my little old log cabin in the lane. 
BOY. 
Oh! daddy, don't you be so sad and melancholy now, 
For you there's many happy days in store, 
Although you're old and feeble, your boy is young and strong, 
And will love and cherish you for evermore; 
ni try and do the best I 
can to make you happy now, 
I'll comfort and protect you from all pain. 
BOTH. 
And the angels they will bless us in our happy little home, 
In/ our little old log cabin in the lane. 
OLD MAN, 
Oh, child I 
am contented, but the day must quickly come, 
When I'll have to leave this earth for evermore, 
The angels they will take me -from my bumble little cot, 
And waft me to that bright celestial shore. 
BOY. 
Oh, don't despair, but come what may, you will be happy yetv 
If horn sorrow and bad feeling you refrain.

An Irishman from Donegal.

And I

Of the war in Europe I 
know all about, 
A 
brass band follows me when,I go out, 
The boys all lift their hats and shout, 
For the man with education.

MANY CAN HELP ONE. 
Sung nightly by WILT,. H. 
MORTON, with HARRIGAN S
.: HART'S. 
Combination. 
Some very good sayings I've heard in my time, 
And some I 
believe to be true; 
The subject Fll mention to-night in my song 
Is one that is well known to you. 
Should you meet a 
man that is down in the workl, 
And assistance you can't give him any, 
Remember that many can always help one, 
While one cannot always help many. 
A 
man may be wealthy one end of the year, 
The next one be wretched and poor, 
He struggles hi hardest to keep himself up, 
But has sunk down to poverty's door. 
To snob worthy men, ' tis a 
terrible blow, 
So give it to those most in need, 
For you who've experienced poverty know 
'Tis a 
very hard battle indeed. 
I 
hope what I've mentioned to-night in my song, 
That nothing I've said out of place ; 
A 
man though he's poor may still honest be, 
For poverty is no disgrace. 
So give what you can with a 
generous heart, 
We don't know how soon things may turn; 
Give him a 
chance to rise up in the world, 
And your kindness he'll surely return. 
A Poem recited by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
Listen to the water-mill, all the livelong day, 
How the creaking of the wheel wears the hours away; 
Languidly the water glides—ceaseless on and still— 
Never coming back again to that water-mill. 
And the proverb haunts my mind, as the spell is cast— 
The mill will never grind again with the water that has passed. 
Take the lesson to yourself, loving hearts and true, 
Golden years are passing by, youth is passing, too; 
Try to make the most of life, los.: no honest way, 
All that you can call your own lies in this—to- day. 
Power, intellect and strength may not, cannot last, 
The mill will never grind again with tie i 
t^r that has passed. 
Oh, the wasted hours of life that have fleeted by, 
Oh, the good we might have done, lut without a 
sigh; 
Love that once we might have saved with but a 
single word, 
Thoughts conceived, but not expressed—perishing unheard. 
Take the lesson to your heart, take, oh 
hold it fast, 
The mill will never grind again with the water that has passed.

THE BANKS OF THE POTOMAC. 
Written by EnwARD HARRIGAN, and sung by him in his beauti-
ful sketch of " The Blue and the G-ray." 
On the banks of the Potomac, 
I 
am lonely here to-
night, 
Sure I'm waiting for the enemy 
To come out here and fight; 
Arrah, when this war is over, 
Oh, I 
will bless the day, 
Let me be dead or living, 
I'd praise America. 
But sure I 
can't help thinking 
Of the girl I 
left behind, 
A 
rosy Irish lassie, . 
So loving.and so kind; 
My dear old grey-haired mother, 
I 
left there all alone, 
I'd feel like young Napoleon, 
When I 
go marching home. 
Oh, a 
soldier's life is tedious, 
When he's laying loose in camp, 
We never have excitement 
unless we're on a 
tramp; 
A 
short life and a 
merry one, 
Is generally our lot, 
Till we get our life-long furlough, 
From the enemy's heavy shot. 
If a 
soldier's never kilt, 
Oh, he's smothered up in luck, 
Should he lose an ear or finger, 
Or be wid a 
bagnet strucks* 
He can get a 
pair of crutches, 
From the doctor, it's well known, 
And feel like the King of Persia, 
When he goes marching home. 
It's a 
pleasure to the soldier, 
To look up in the skies, 
And see the stars a-blinking, 
Like a 
pair of roguish eyes; 
A-winking and a-
twinkling, 
Just as if they'd say— 
You may kiss me if you catch me, 
Before I 
get away. 
For to hear the wind a-howling 
And moaning through the trees, 
It's enough to make you shiver, 
And tremble in the knees; 
But I 
must do mrduty, 
If I 
petrify to stone, 
I'll feel like Julius Cxsar, 
When'T go marching home.

RAMBLING BY THE STREAM, 
SONG AND DANCE. 
Snug by G. W . 
GRIFFIN and MART. HANLEY, champion 
athletic song and dance artists. 
A ramble by the stream is so delightful, 
On a 
lovely summer's day, 
When the pretty birds are singing to their heightful, 
And flowers are blooming gay; 
Upon the banks reclining, 
Beside a 
maiden fair, 
And pretty posies twining, 
To deck her silken hair, 
And then a 
little ramble by the streamlet, 
Beneath the shady trees, 
So pleasantly refreshed by 
The summer's welcome breeze. 
CHORUS. 
When on the banks reclining, 
I'm pretty posies twining, 
To give while rambling with my little treasure. 
It's like a 
blissful dream. 
Oh, what could bring more pleasure, 
Than rambling by the stream. 
My pretty little treasure's name is Nora, 
She dwells beside the stream, 
And I 
shall ne'er forget when first I 
saw her, 
For I 
confused did seem, 
r
As I 
strolled through the garden, 
I 
unto her did say— 
I 
humbly ask your pardon, 
For trespassing this way. 
She blushed beneath her pretty little sunshade, 
Where underneath was seen, 
A smile when I 
at at once said— 
Come ramble by the stream. 
When on the banks, etc. 
To stroll beside the streamlet she consented, 
'Twas then I 
did perceive 
A 
chance for me, so I 
at once presented 
My suit to her that eve; 
For her reply I 
waited, 
As anxious as could be, 
And then she hesitated, 
And said don't bother me. 
But now for life slie is my darling little treasure, 
So happy does she seem, 
Now what time we've at leisure, 
We're rambling by the stream. 
When on the banks, etc.

DORKINS' NIGHT. 
Written by BOBBY NEwcous, and sung with great success by 
W ILLIAM SCAICLA-N", at the Olympic Theatre, Broadway, N. Y. 
Music published by Jolts PERRY, Washington St., "oppOsIti posiltia 
Theatre, Boston, Mass. 
The theatre was full—it was Dorkins' night— 
That is, Dorkins was going to appear 
-.At night, in a 
favorite comedy part, 
For he was comedian here. 
Funny! ,why, he'd make you laugh, till the tears 
Ran down your face like rain; 
And every time he came on the stage, 
You'd try to stop laughingin vain. 
A family? yes, he'd a 
family, 
And he lov'd them as dear as his life; 
And you'd scarcely find a 
happier lot 
Than Dorkins', children and wife. 
And you'd scarcelY find a 
happier lot 
Than Dorkins' children arid wife. 
There came one. 
night, and I 
was in front, 
And Dorkins was going to play 
A 
charaCter new to himself and the stage, 
Which he'd trod for many a 
day. 
By eight the theatre was perfectly jammed, 
All awaited a 
pleasant surprise; 
For they knew they'd laugh 'till their sides would ache 
And they 1oN'd for the Curtain to rise. 
The play soon beg4n7—each neckwas stretched forth, 
And eagerly watched eafit :eye, 
For Dorkins to mak4''10

To give him a 
cheerful hi! hi! 
For Dorkins to make his first entrance, and then 
To give him a

It last he !
typearf3d, amid loud applause, 
But something was wrong you could see; 
"Why, Dorkins is playing quite badly to-night r 
The people said, sitting 'round me. 
A 
hiss I_ yes, it was; I 
saw Dorking start 
As if stung by a 
serpent's fang; 
And he'd cast a 
bOSeeching look all 'round, 
„While. 
his head on his breast he would hang. 
" 
He's drunk I" some one said, and I 
thought so myself, 
For, to me, it was awful at times, 
To see how. he'd struggle along with his part, 
And continually stick in his lines, 
To see how he'd struggle along with his part, 
And continually stick in his lines. 
The footlights, at last, he approached very slow, 
And, " Ladies and gentlemen," said— 
" 
If I 
cannot please you to-night. 
The fault's not the heart, but the head. 
There's many a 
night I've made you all laugh, 
When so ill I 
could scarcely well stand; 
And every effort was pain to me then— 
Yes, if even I'd raise but my hand. 
You hiss me to-night, and say, that I'm drunk," 
From his heart came a 
sob and a 
moan; 
" 
I'll tell you the reason—I 
know you won't laugh— 
I've a 
little one dying at home! 
I'll tell you the reason—I 
know you won't laugh— 
rye a 
little one dying at home !"

When I'm dead and gone from you, darling, 
When I'm laid away in my grave, 
When my spirit has gone to heaven above, 
To him who my soul will save. 
When you are happy and gay once more, 
Thinking of the days that have been, 
There's one little wish I 
ask of you, 
See that my grave's kept green. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, the days will come to you, darling, 
When on earth no more I'll be seen, 
One sweet little wish, darling, grant me, 
See that my grave's kept green. 
Will you keep me, love in remembrance, 
When the voice of chiding is heard, 
When other's may speak in censure or blame, 
Speak not one unkindly word. 
When you are happy and gay once more, 
Thinking of the days that have been, 
There's one little wish I

See that my grave's kept green.

Original Song and Dance, by JOHNSON AND BRUNO. 
Oh! white folks all good evening, 
We've come to sing to you 
About our home in Aiabam, 
Our Massa and Missus too. 
We use to work down in de field, 
Dey call us Pete and Sam; 
At evenings how we'd sing and dance 
At home in Alabam. 
CHORUS. 
The good old times have passed, but still 
We're happy as two clams; 
We'll sing and do a 
step we done, 
At home in Alabam. 
Old ,massa he was kind to us, 
.But soon he passed away; 
And silence reigns around the place, 
Where things were once so gay. 
The aarkies they have all gone North, 
And scarcely left a 
man 
To play upon the old banjo, 
At home in Alabam. 
The god old times, 
c. 
Oh ! .white folks all, we'll say good-bye, 
We're much obliged to you 
For listening to our little song, 
We tried to please you too. 
We're free and honest niggers now, 
We love old Uncle Sam, 
And the Lord up high will give us all 
A 
home in Alabam. 
The good old times, &c.

I

From Jersey's foreign shore; 
Strange people always meeting, 
That I 
never met before. 
If I 
see a 
lady in distress, 
Who does not know the way 
I 
go to her politely, 
And with a 
smile I 
say— 
I'm just the man, etc. 
I 
have a 
confidential friend, 
Who lives way out of town; 
Last week he sent me a 
letter, 
To say he vas coming down. 
He's going to bring his pocketbook, 
To see the sights he'll try; 
Of course I 
wrote immediately, 
And this was my reply— 
I'm just the man, etc. 
Now there's Tom Jones who once was rich, 
His father owned a 
bank; 
But all that's left of fortune 
Is now a 
great big blank. 
From ' ducats" he came down to - sous," 
From " sous" to something worse; 
All he can give is " I

When drawing on your purse. 
SPOKEN.--I 
met this gentleman to- day. 
Ile suddenly con-
fronted me; didn't know it till he had me by the hand " Aix, 
how do you do, old boy ?" he said, " I'm delighted to see your 
Beautiful weather, isn't it? 
But say, excuse ine, 
rather short to-day; could you oblige me with—" " Now hold 
on," I 
said, " that's enough"— 
I 
used to visit a 
pretty girl, 
Who said she loved me true; 
My hand and fortune I 
offered her, 
Now what more could I 
do? 
But oh, that girl went back on me, 
For a 
fancy Broadway gent; 
He took her off to parts unknown, 
I 
don't know where they went. 
SPOKEN.—I 
don't blame her so much, but that man—that 
horrid man—who stole away my Maria, oh! if I 
could only 
lay my hands on him now— 
He's just the man, etc.

FASHIONABLE BEATS. 
Sung by J. D. Roomy. 
Copyright, 1877, by A. 
S. 
FISHER, 98 Nassau Street, New York. 
Now, look out, boys, I'm corning, with 
Another rhyming treat, 
'Tis all about these Grand Moguls 
Called fashionable beats. 
They're such a 
lot of amiables, 
With such a 
gorgeous strut, 
'Twould be a 
pity to take them down, 
So 
just show them up. 
CHORUS. 
Cheeky snoozers, sidewalk cruisers, 
Twirling their sticks—'nough to make a 
dog sick 
Dyed mustachios, waxed mustachios, 
That's the style of our fashionable beats. 
You'll find them on big hotel steps, 
With toothpicks in their teeth, 
After eating cheese and crackers at 
The free-lunch bar beneath. 
And while talking dollars, dog, and horse, 
Just like some moneyed swell, 
They'll boast of how they dined and wined, 
At such and such hotel. 
Dashy, flashy, anything but cashy, 
Talking stock shares like some great millionaires. 
Garret lodgers, creditor dodgers, 
That's the style of our fashionable beats. 
They sneer at honest workingmen, 
While they all labor shirk 
They live and sponge on others, but, 
Themselves, they never work. 
They loll around on corners, and 
At ladies boldly stare, 
But never pay their tailors for 
The flashy clothes they wear. 
CHORUS. 
Windy, gassy, -cheeky, brassy, 
Putting on dash, without one cent of cash 
Free-lunch eaters, wash-women cheaters. 
That's the style of our fashionable oeats.

Oh many moons have passed and gone, 
Since first I 
went to school, 
At Harvard, dear old Harvard, friends. 
I 
learned the Golden Rule; 
My classmates scattered here and there. 
All trod their different ways, 
I 
love to think and ponder o'er 
My youthful college days. 
(Repeat last two limes.) 
I 
remember when a 
Freshman there. 
My age just twenty-four, 
In the Yale and IIarvard race, my friends, 
I 
always rowed stroke oar,:,, 
Our colors—handsome scarlet bright— 
First led the van always, 
Admired by the ladies all, 
Was I 
in college days.

Oh, the day when I 
did graduate, 
I 
was my parents pride. 
Fitted for the bar or bench, 
A linguist, too, beside; 
Socially I'd always meet 
My colleagues bright and gay, 
And toss a 
merry social glass, 
To our commencement day. 
(Repeat last two lines.) 
Culture and intelligence, 
Are qualities quite fine. 
They help constitute the gentleman, 
In every worldly clime; 
You may crush them down unto the ground, 
With poverty's cold ways, 
They'll rise again, assert their claims, 
As taught in college days.

want to see the cotton fields, 
And the dear old home again. 
I'm left all sad and lonely now, 
When my days are very few, 
My wife and children both are gone, 
I 
don't know what to do ; 
My master too, he may be dead, 
His hair was turning gray, 
Oh, let me see that good old home, 
Before I 
pass away. 
Oh, the good old days, etc. 
When I 
was free I 
left that land, 
Where the days are bright and fair, 
Where missus spoke to me so kind, 
When I 
was bowed with care ; 
I left that home no friends to find, 
My heart was filled with pain, 
Oh, take me to that good old home, 
To see it once again. 
Oh, the good old days, etc.'

4 Art ingenious little book of the thaumaturgic order, has been sent us,

way as to give opportw. 
nity for a 
decidedly puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary a'so

bound that a 
practised manipulator taking it up and flirting the leavei 
over, can make it appear to be filled only with one picture, or with blank 
pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of figures. 
One minute the 
pamphlet, quickly thumbed, appears to contain nothing but the portrait 
of Harlequin, in his tesselated snit; the next only Columbine, then 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or Ilephistophiles. A 
little 
practice, and the directions printed with the book will make anybody
