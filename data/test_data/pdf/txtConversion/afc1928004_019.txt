"WHEN THIS CRUEL WAR IS OVER ." 
Composed by HENRY TuoKRE, Esq. 
(The words of this song, with the music, are published in sheet-
form by Sawyer and Thompson, 59 Fulton Avenue, Brooklyn, N. Y., 
and are used in this book by permission.) 
DEAREST love, do you remember. 
When we last did meet, 
How you told me that you loved me, 
Kneeling at my feet? 
Oh, how proud you stood before me, 
In your suit of blue, 
When you vowed to me and country 
Ever to be true! 
Chorus—Weeping sad and lonely, 
Hopes and fears how vain! 
Yet praying, when this cruel war is over— 
Praying that we meet again! 
When the summer breeze is sighing 
Mournfully along, 
Or when autumn leaves are falling, 
Sadly breathes the song. 
Oft in dreams I 
see thee lying 
On the battle-plain— 
Lonely, wounded, even dying— 
Calling, but in vain 1 
Weeping sad, etc. 
6 
FRANK CONVERSE'S 
If; amid the din of battle, 
Nobly you should fall, 
Far away from those who love you, 
None to hear your call— 
Who would whisper Words of comfort, 
Who would soothe your pain? 
Ah I 
the many cruel fancies 
Ever in my brain. 
Weeping sad, etc. 
But our country called you,. darling; 
Angels cheer your way; 
While our nation's sons are fighting, 
We can only pray. 
Nobly strike for God and liberty! 
Let all nations see 
How we love the starry banner, 
Emblem of the free! 
Weeping sad, etc. 
CALL ME NOT BACK FROM THE ECHOLESS SHORE, 
1N REPLY TO 
" 
Rock me to Sleep, Mother." 
Music composed and arranged by HENRY TUCKER, Esq. 
(The words of this song, with the music, are published in sheet-
form by Sawyer & Thompson, 59 Fulton Avenue, Brooklyn, and are 
tisA in this book by permission.) ' 
W HY is your forehead deep furrowed with care? 
What has so soon mingled frost in your hair? 
Why are you sorrowful, why do you weep ? 
Why do you ask me to " rock you to sleep?" 
Could you but see through this world's vale of tears, 
Light would your sorrows be, harmless your fears; 
All that seems darkness to you would be light— 
All would be sunshine where now is but night. 
Chorus. 
Follow me cheerfully, pray do not weep; 
In spirit I'll soothe you and " rock you to sleep." 
OLD "CiEMONA SONGSTER. 
7 
Why would you backward with Time again turn? 
Why do you still for your childhood's days yearn ? 
Weary one, why through the past again roam, 
While in the future the path leads you home? 
Oh, dearest child, dry those tears! weep no more— 
Call me not back from the " echoless shore." 
Follow me cheerfully, pray do not weep; 
In spirit 
soothe you, and " rock you to sleep." 
Follow me cheerfully, etc.

Chorus. 
So look out, boys, and mind your eyes, 
When you come through the alley; 
Don't fall in love wid that little gal 
Dey call young Oyster Sally. 
[For air of chorus, sing the last eight measures.] 
There was a 
jolly fisherman, his name was Mister Crank; 
He used to fish for porgies, down on Coney Island bank; 
He fell in lub wid dis young gal before dat he did know her, 
From seeing her picture painted on a 
Broadway omnibus-
door. 
So look out, boys, etc. 
He took her to de City Hall, where de soldiers live in tents, 
But her cruel heart was conquered by de Sigel regiment: 
" 
Come, change de rings nait me, mine love," a 
Dutchman 
he did say. 
Then broke his drum on de fisherman's head, and both did 
run away. 
So look out, boys, etc. 
A QUERY. 
JULIUS, what was it that your sweetheart gave you— 
that she wouldn't have if she could have, nor she couldn't 
have if she would, and yet she gave it to you? 
Why, what was it? 
A WIFE, to be sure. 
Dot's a 
fact, Sara. 
I 
took her for better or for woorse, 
and I 
found her a 
good deal woser dan I 
took her to be. 
You did ? 
Yes. 
Now, Sam, why is de ladies here dis ebening like 
de magnetic telegraph? 
I 
really couldn't tell—why? 
Because dere is a 
magnetic influence in deir eyes dat 
conveys intelligence to de heart ob men.

ENCORE VERSES. 
Dar is no silver nowadays; and money, dot has flew, 
Excepting lots of postage-stamps, and greenbacks cut in

I 'spec dey ask percentage, by-and-by, for sojers' buttons. 
Den white folks, etc. 
I 
wish de white folks ob de Norf and Souf would hear tc 
me: 
I 
tell den; it's de only way, to let de niggers be, 
As in our country's laws it am an institution; 
Den let us end dis trouble by de laws ob de constitution. 
Den white folks, etc.

OLD CREMONA SONGSTER. 
The ladies all, in sweet perfume, 
Their dresses made in splen-di-or, 
And with a 
trail five yards behind, 
Just like an engine-tender— 
They keep the walks and crossings clean, 
Their dress is a 
patent sweeping-machine; 
If" Hackley the Great" would hire them, 
He'd clean the streets much cheaper. 
With bonnets stuck up on their head, 
And on the top three ro-si-es; 
With cloth enough to make a 
suit, 
In their long shanghai joseys; 
Hoops like Professor Lowe's balloon, 
With gas enough to go to the moon; 
And when they swing, just stand aside, 
Or your legs are dislocated!

Oh, I

And live on de money what Abram Linkum don't want. 
Oh, there's John Bull! he's got a 
skull, 
But very little in it; 
And then, I 
know, he wants our wool, 
And a 
war, he wants now to begin it. 
Oh, ragged Sally, from Shinbone Alley, 
She promised for to marry me; 
But she altered her mind, and she wasn't inclined 
For to join with me in de holy bands ob hemlock. 
Oh, white folks, now we're goin' away, 
To seek some other furrin clime; 
We'll come right back here some other day, 
And sing this song fur the second time. 
GOLD BUTTONS. 
THOSE are very pretty buttons you have got on that coat, 
Julius. 
Yes, Sam—dey're gold buttons. 
Gold !—how many carats? 
You mean dem kind dey put in soup ? 
No, no; how many carats fine ? 
Oh, go 'long, Sam! 
Do you 'spose dat I

No, sir- eel 
GOOD REASON. 
POMP, what makes you hab no wool on de top ob your 
head ? 
Well, Julius, I 
was out West 'bout free months ago; 
and de reason I 
got bald was, de gals out dar used to pull 
me into deir winders.

Shoddy-contract's all de go, and money fur de same; 
And if you're a 
politician, you're sure to git de game: 
No matter what the job is, either shoddy or a 
ram' 
For all you've got to do is, charge the 
bill to Uncle Sam. 
Den mind yourself here, etc. 
Gold and silver's mighty scarce, so de -change we have to 
cramp, 
And fur de legal tender use de little postage-stamp; 
But the thing is all played out, like Aunt Jemima's plaster; 
De more you try to pull 'em out, de more dey stick de 
faster. 
Oh, paper-money's plenty, and men to spend de same, 
But where it all goes to—nobody is to blame— 
So what's de use of fifin' if you can't beat on de drum? 
You have got to know your biz, or you'd better stay at 
home.

"Oh, where are you goin'?" Lady Nancy then said, 
"Oh, where are you goin'?" said she. 
"I'm going, going far away, 
Strange countries for to see, see, see, 
Strange countries for to see." 
He had not been gone but a 
year and a 
day, 
Strange scenery for to see, 
When singular thoughts went into his head: 
His Nancy Bell he would go see, see, see, 
His Nancy Bell he would go see. 
He rode, and he rode, on his milk-white steed, 
Till he came unto London town; 
And there he heard the City-Hall bell, 
And the people all running around, round, round, 
And the people all running around. 
"Is there any one dead?" Lord Lovell then said— 
"Is there any one dead?" said he. ' 
"A lord's lady is dead," a 
lady then said, 
"And they call her the Lady Nan-cy—cy—cy, 
And they call her the Lady Nancy." 
He ordered the grave to be open-i-ed, 
And the shroud to be folded down; 
And then he kissed her clay-cold lips, 
Till the tears they went trickling down, down, down, 
The tears they come trickling down. 
Lady Nancy she died, as it might be to-day, 
Lord Lovell he died to- morrow; 
And out of her bosom there grew a 
red rose, 
And out of Lord Lovell's a 
brier—rier—rier, 
And out of Lord Lovell's a 
brier.

ceedings ob de people what rewolve on de axes of de globe 
in general; so jest hold your breff while I 
dive into de ob-

Fustly, my dear lambs, dar 
was Mr. Napoleparte Bonicum, dat fit de battle oh Man-
has-us, in Tennessee, on de Pay- monkey riber, What did 
they do ? 
I 
repeat, widout repetition, W HAT DID THEY 1)0? 
Didn't Bacchus, de god ob soda- water, say to Peter Cooper dat 
if Cashus Mud—no, I 
mean Clay—was elected de chimney-
inspector in de sixth ward. de Prince ob Whales never could 
have got married to de King of Tanbark's daughter, Eit? 
De land ob Paradise and honey would once more smile on 
New York, specie-money would flow around de streets, and 
sixpenny plates ob hash at de Revere House would be abol-
ished; and what would be de use of interwention then? 
Sec-
ondly-, 
My conscripted Brigadiers, suppose dat de prophet 
Moses, when he addressed de Baxter street-itities from de 
top of Bunker Hill's monument, had only introduced de con-
traband question ? Would not Phareoh, de King ob Egypt 
in Illinois skedaddled from de amalgamators, and made 
Lester Wallack's beautiful figure conglomerate into a 
quint-
essence, and engage Caroline Richings, Countess of Cham-
pagne, fur de season? 
And dat would awert de deadly 
cats-after me of Aaron not bein' found in de bullrushes, or 
make Simpson close his pawn-shop in de Bowery. 
AND 
what would be de use of interwention then? Thirdly, my agi-
tated fire-eaters, as General -Banks remarked to me, when 
Paris run away wid Helen at de bombardment of Fort Sum-
ter, and pulled Abe Linkum into de war- panic, and caused 
Horace Greeley's nine hundred thousand men to make a 
flank movement on de rear ob de Tombs, what right had 
de High Bridge at Harlem to be built on such a 
multum-

nocence, and swine-dealtrs, just let de double-distilled extract 
of Doctor Tumblety's Saspariller and Foot- wash be intro-
duced into Mayor Opdyke's private office: den Commodore 
Nutt can go to Europe; P. T. Barnum come de pie-us dodge 
in his " Lecture-Room ;" a

ren; de Broadway Rolerade bill go up higher dan a 
kite;

One day this dorg was slumborin' 
Behind the kitchen stove, 
When suddenly a 
wicked flea— 
An ugly little cove— 
Commenced upon his faithful back 
With many jumps to rove. 
Then up rose that ter-ri-u-er, 
With frenzy in his, eye, 
And, waitin' only long enough 
To make a 
touchin' cry, 
Commenced to twist hisself about 
Most wonderfully spry. 
But all in vane; his shape was sich, 
So awful short and fat, 
That though he doubled up hisself, 
And strained hisself at that, 
His mouth was half an inch away 
From where the varmint sat! 
Sam Johnson heard the noise, and came 
To save his anamile; 
But when he sees the critter spin, 
And barkin' all the while, 
He dreaded hy-dry-pho-bi-a, 
And then began to rile. 
"The dorg is mad enough!" says he; 
And, luggin' in his axe, 
He gave that retched ter-ri-er 
A 
pair of awful whacks, 
That stretched him on the fib-i-er 
As dead as carpet- tacks I

painted a

had finished paintin' de cow, 
an awful catastrophy occurred. 
Well, what was it? 
Why, Sam, it spoilt de pictur. 
What was the aceidora? 
De accident was dis. 
De pictur was so true to natur,

SAM, why was Vespucius de navigator so jovial? 
Julius, I

Because, Sam, he was A-meri-cus. 
Why are red-headed soldiers always ready to tight ? 
Because dey carry deir fire- locks on deir shoulders.

'Twas I 
myself received invitation 
To invite all the girls and boys I 
might ask; 
In less than five minutes I 
had friends and relation, 
AU singing as merry as bees round a 
cask. 
There was Jenny O'Hara. the nate little milliner, 
She tipped me the wink, and asked me to call; 
When who should arrive but Timothy Gillighan, 
Just in time for Lanigan's ball? 
Whack! fol, etc. 
When I 
arrived they was dancin' the polka, 
All round the room in a 
queer whirligig; 
Jenny and I 
put an end to the nonsense— 
We tipped them a 
taste of a 
nate Irish jig. 
Oh, molly murther 1 
now wasn't she proud of me? 
We battered the floor till the ceiling did fall; 
For I'd spent three weeks at Brooks's academy, • 
A-larnin' the steps for Lanigan's ball, 
Whack! fol, etc. 
The boys were all merry, the gals were all frisky, 
Dancin' around in couples and groups; 
Paddy O'Rafferty met with an accident— 
Got his right leg in Miss Lanigan's hoops. 
The creature she fainted, and cried, " Molly murther I" 
She called for her friends, and gathered them all; 
Tim Donnelly swore that he'd go no further, 
But he'd have satisfaction at Lanigan's ball. 
Whack! fol, etc. 
Och, my boys! oh, there was the ruction; 
Myself got a 
tip from Felix MeCool— 
I 
quickly replied to his nate introduction, 
And kicked up the devil's own fill-a-ba-loo I 
Ould Kaser the piper be got nearly strangled; 
He packed up his pipes, his chanters, and all; 
The girls in their ribbons they all got entangled, 
And that put an end to Lanigan's ball.

I played before de King ob France, likewise de Queen ob 
Spain; 
'And for de Queen ob Englum, right in de Drury Lane. 
She says, " My hansum colored boy, just play a 
little jig, 
I 
want to have a 
little dance"—she danced just like a 
pig! 
I 
never will forget it, and I 
think I 
never ought, 
When I 
played before de jury and de judge, right in de 
court. 
De man was tried for murder, but de judge was full ob glee; 
De banjo made him happy, and he set dat poor man free.

How conceited I'd look in a 
tine laurel-wreath, 
Wid my head in my mouth, to stand pickin' my teeth 
Wid a 
tight little twig of shillalah I" 
To sustain the Union I 
firmly will aid, 
Wid my tight little twig of shillalah; 
For a 
divil of a 
rumpus Jeff Davis has made, 
As sure as there's bogs in Killalah! 
I'll still for our friends have a 
heart warm and true, 
To our foes give my hand—for what else can I 
do? 
Yes, I'll give 'ern my hand—but along wid it, too, 
A 
tight little twig of sliillalah 
TO SEE WHAT I 
CAN SEE. (Comic Banjo- Song.)

FRANK CONVERSE'S 
Now, there's a 
man a 
smilin', he's dressed so very neat, 
Wid his arm around a 
little gal, she looks so very sweet; 
He looks a 
kind-er languishin', she looks him in de eye— 
But if her mammy- heard ob dis, why, she'd bust out and cry 
Oh, don't you see dat charmer, a-sittin' over there? 
She's dressed to deli wid jewelry, and ringlets in her hair. 
Her husband's mighty rich, and has got a 
bad cough; 
It's made him sick, a-buyin' things for her to show off. 
Now, there's a 
hansum clerk, wid eyelashes on his lip; 
He kisses all de pretty gals, wid his sip- per, sip—ah—sip; 
He does it, kind-er careless, and always on de sly; 
But if he doesn't steal a 
dress, de gals dey say, " Oh, fie!"

There was a 
gal—one Jane Matilda— 
Love for him had nearly killed her; 
She was a 
straw-bonnet builder. 
In a 
shop down town. 
Dressed to death, with han'some features, 
Every day he'd go to meet her, 
And to lager-bier he would treat her— 
Oh, he did it brown! 
He promised he'd be her defender, 
And to de halter he'd attend her; 
But he went oil on a 
bender, 
And he soon got tight. 
De police found him in de gutter— 
Not a 
word he scarce could utter; 
So dey brought him on a 
shutter, 
To de Tombs dat night.
