TAPE BEGINS WITH INTERVIEWER:
So, why don't we just start by, uh, how did you get involved with Lowell in the first place?
S:  Uh huh.  That is a good one.  Uh, I was aware of what was going on here in kind of a general 
way.  I had been for quite a long time.  Uh, just because it was an interesting city, and when you 
are studying cities it comes up very early on as an early planned city.  So it is something that you 
know about.  And there was a lot of talk in the early 70's about, uh, revitalization and beginning 
to try to do this.  I worked at the time, uh, at the Office of State Planning in Massachusetts.  The 
director of that office was Frank Keefe, who had been the Planning Director in Lowell when the 
Urban Cultural Park scheme was first getting going.  So it was something that was a topic in the 
office quite a bit.  Uh, we were there, I was there for not a terribly long time.  Uh, when Mike 
[Ducas?] lost the primary, the famous primary you may have heard about, he was preparing to go
into his second term and all of a sudden, surprise, he didn't make it.  The office was not created 
legislatively, it was something that he had created as his own personal advisory and planning arm
for Massachusetts, and had done some terrific things,  but was not required to exist by law.  
Anyway, to make a long story short, when he was at the whole state planning structure was out 
the window.  We were all out on the street.  Uh, Frank, who we (--)  It was a very lively, active, 
wonderful group of people, felt quite personally reasonable to all of us and was referring people 
and so forth.  And uh, it happened to be in '78, just when the park was created.  And the 
Commission idea was, the bill had not quite passed when this was going on.  Or it had just 
passed.  Anyway, the Commission was just getting going, and he matched me up with what was 
happening here, and he said "This would be a good place for you".  Uh, and I mean we always 
tell this funny story, so I will tell you the funny story of going to meet Fred Faust the first time, 
who is the Executive Director, where he and his secretary were sharing uh, it wasn't even a desk 
it was a table, over in this horrible basement office at the University of Lowell with the sea-scape
of New England Mural on the walls.  And Paul Marion was the kid working across the hall for 
the Public Relations Office.  I mean you really had to have faith.  I mean they are telling you 
"there is this $20,000 project" and on, and on, and on.  And here are these young people running 
around with no formal setup, with a lot of promises and a lot of ideas.  And uh, I signed on.  
What can I say.  I had some very specific ideas of what I was looking for.  I had worked in a 
number of other communities, more at the local levels actually, I hadn't really worked at the State
level that long, I was just there for a year.  Uh, but I was looking for a series of ingredients in a 
community that had a good overall planning perspective that had a very strong, local, political 
support, and had the money to do what they wanted to do.  Uh, and was of more than just local 
significance.  Uh, it is easy to get a job as a planning director for a small city and do that.  Uh, 
but I was looking for something that was on a broader scale and had a greater significance and it 
just seemed to me that this was worth taking a risk.  Uh, it was also early enough in the process.  
I mean the bill had been passed but there was no plan.  There were outlines of it.  Uh, (--)
D:  So what were your first tasks when you got started?
S:  To do the plan.  
O:  What's your title?
S:  Planning Director of the Commission.  [O:  Oh, okay.]  Which again, you have to understand, 
I don't know whether you talk to people about the Commission itself, but on purpose it always 
had a somewhat ambiguous role, because underneath it all there was a real nervousness on behalf
of congress.  Whether putting this much money into a small town, whether the money was going 
to be spent right, or whether it was just going to fall into the hands of the (--) whether it would be
selling by local politics.  And the idea of the Commission was to set up a highly professional 
group to keep an eye on that.  To make sure that there is plenty of local involvement.  I mean we 
have three city counselors on the commission, other people appointed by the city manager.  It is 
not removed from that, but to  make sure that it was done according to very high standards, also 
to keep an eye on the park service.  Uh, to make sure that the Park Service wasn't setting this 
thing up and doing it however they wished.  So it was always, uh, it was on purpose a little bit 
unclear, although the authorities, when you read the legislation, are very, very, strong.  And the 
requirements are very strong.  One of the things that is most important, there is just a little line in
the legislation, was that the Commission is responsible for setting, establishing standards for 
preservation work in the district.  Well the district is the whole city practically, it is the whole 
downtown anyway.  Uh, and if those standards are not appealed, this is standards for preservation
work as well as new construction, uh, if the standards aren't appealed all the park's money can be
withheld.  And we actually, I mean that is one of the main things I did in the early years was 
getting the uh (--) It became the Historic Review Board, the Historic Board, uh, getting that set 
up.  But we actually went up before the City Council at one point and they were just dead lock, 
we couldn't get (--) We had so many versions.  See, everybody was fighting back and forth.  Uh, 
"If you guys don't pass this ordinance, uh, we are going to have to tell them to stop sending 
federal money to Lowell".  And we actually got someone at the secretary's office to write a letter 
like that, saying we don't want to withhold all your money, but we are going to do it if you don't 
pass this thing.  So there were some items in this laundry list, uh, we were given buildings to be 
responsible for, we were responsible for this survey, we were responsible for transportation 
program, uh, all these various things, but nobody said how to do it.  It just said you will tend to 
these things.  That's why doing the preservation plan was so exciting because it was (--) We were
finally going to be concrete about the (--)  There was this whole, really pretty visionary scheme, 
it was basically Pat's idea.  Okay, it was first turned into, (--) This was the original proposal that 
everybody calls a brown book, that kind of showed people what this thing could be.  And this 
was done as a lobbying tool for getting the park passed.  
D:  Where did this come from?
S:  That was done, uh, by some planning consultants and local people who worked on it in 
advance before the National Park was created.  Okay.  [D:  UNCLEAR]  Yeah.  Okay.  But that 
was an overview of the potential of what you could do and ideas.  And it is wonderful, I mean 
that is another reason that I came here.  Because that is one of the best planning documents I had 
ever seen at that point.  The interesting thing is though, the people who did it, put together this 
great thing, I don't want to say that they were dragged out of town, but they were not real 
popular.  I mean they put together a fabulous book, but personally people were just fed up with 
them and felt that they were very arrogant and had a terrible (--) I mean it was like bedside 
manners.  A great doctor but nobody wanted to (--)  [D:  Why were people fed up?  Who was fed 
up?]  Uh, well specifically the people on the Commission did not hire them.   In order to do our 
plan, we had to do a detailed plan, we had our choice of people to work with us.  And they were 
runner up, and Frank Keefe is one, uh, Fred Faust he had worked with him very closely.  They 
had a lot to do with shaping the legislation, although Fred was really the author who put it 
together.   But they were the technical resource.  I mean Fred was a young guy, uh, with a 
training in Broadcasting, you know.  He was Tsongas's press secretary.  He didn't have a lot of in 
depth content knowledge.  But he is certainly sharp and cared and so forth.  But uh, I know he 
was fed up with them.  There was rape before I came here, a lot of that.  So in terms of the 
people, I don't know.  But the general feeling was that they had done a great job, but thank you 
very much and let's find somebody knew.  [LAUGHING]  Which is funny because I still 
consider them as kind of the professional grandparents of the park.  I mean everybody has 
somebody that they talk to and you talk to Pat as sort of a mentor on one level and with Paul 
Tsongas on another.  I talked to the planners Strong Lane, and Dennis Frenchman, uh, I still stay 
in touch with them.  I didn't really work with them on this, but I use it often and I refer back to it.
And I see them, John Lane teaches at Harvard and he brings his class up once a year.  And it is 
funny because we disagree on a lot of things and I challenge in front of his students and we get 
into all these squabbles back and forth.  It is funny because uh, he did a magnificent job on this, 
but he still is kind of an elitist.  He is kind of a top down planner.  And he personally takes credit 
for everything.  This is my idea, and that is my idea, and that is just not my approach, or my 
style.  Uh, and he believes because things were in his plan, that's why they happened.  And I look
at it quite differently.  Uh, it is because a lot of us who are at a position to make things happen 
(--)  We may have gotten the idea from his plan, but the plan by itself would not have (--) It 
didn't implement itself.
D:  What was that process?  What parts of that plan were (--)  What parts of that plan endured 
and what (--)
S:  Uh, well there is a huge amount of stuff there.  I mean it is like the Bible, you keep going 
back and looking at it and you will find a little gem.  So it is hard to say, sometimes you forget 
what exactly is in it until you go back and say "Oh yeah."  Uh, the trolley system was in the plan 
and that again has been modified quite a bit, but the idea of using railroad tracks for a rail 
transportation system to move visitors around, the basic inner and outer loop of the canal way 
comes from them.  The basic idea of having history exhibits that are not formal museum exhibits,
but are interactive experiences.  The whole idea of using the definition of the main downtown 
park zone, they call the intensive use zone.  The idea of using the area between Market Mills and 
Boott Mills, uh, they used the analogy of a shopping mall with two anchor stores.  I mean that is 
kind of a rule of thumb of shopping center developers.  That you have two anchor stores at either
end.  I mean if you think of any big shopping mall you know that there is Jordan Marsh at one 
end and Filene's at the other and that supports the little stores along the way.  They were trying to
apply that same approach to a downtown area.  Uh, because there were a lot of alternatives, you 
know, should you (--)  When they were dealing with this whole city should you spend a little bit 
of money all over the place, it was what they call the dispersed alternative.  Or should you 
concentrate in one area.  And you know, there are a lot of (--) I mean if you talked to Paul 
Tsongas about that, he talks about that as a definite decision.  I mean there are equity 
implications, it may seem that it is unfair to spend all of the money downtown, or a lot of the 
money downtown, but people really felt strongly that unless you concentrated the money, enough
to make a physical difference that people could see in one place, you could spend the same 
amount of money and it would be almost invisible, and it wouldn't have the same impact.  It 
wasn't to say that you weren't going to ever spend any money in the neighborhoods, but the idea 
was that you started there first because it was very visible.  And again a lot of that got back to 
[Lane Frenchmans?] idea of the Intensive Use Zone.  Uh, and (--) [O:  Who is Elaine 
Frenchman?]  Pardon me?  [O:  Who is Elaine Frenchman?]  No, Lane and (--)  John Lane and 
Dennis Frenchman are the two guys.  [O:  Oh, okay.]  Yeah, yeah.  Actually, they were part of a 
much larger team, but they were kind of the two principle people and they went off and started 
their own firm called "Lane and Frenchman".  The authors of the book are called David A. 
Krane(?) and partners.  So that is (--) The other thing is that there have been a lot of people that 
have been involved in different kinds of planning studies in Lowell and everybody takes credit 
for it.  So, you know.  Which is (--)
O:  How many, how many, how many agencies are involved in planning in Lowell?  I mean (--)
S:  Right now?  [O:  Yeah.  That you (--)]  Okay, uh, several.  Uh, obviously the main one is the 
city itself, The Division of Planning and Development, which is an arm in the City Manager's 
Office.  Uh, the Heritage State Park is the state presence, uh, there is the National Park Service, 
and ourselves.  There is also, uh, a Regional Planning Commission called the Northern 
Middlesex Area Commission that's dealing, planning activities for the whole region and they do 
some work in Lowell.  They handle more transportation planning.  [O:  So do you have to work 
with all these people?]  Yeah.  [O:  On everything or just some various kinds of things?]  Well at 
the beginning we worked with, uh, we worked with all of them very intensively at the beginning 
to hash up the basic ground rules and the basic plans.  Uh, the idea was once those ideas were in 
place then we didn't have to keep coming back and checking on major policies.  It would be kind 
of clear who is doing what and how they are going about it.  Uh, what has happened in the last 
couple of years is our initial plan was a ten year program and we did kind of (--)  There is a Park 
Service General Manager Plan, there is our Preservation Plan, and the Heritage State Park has a 
more scaled down version.  But what happened is that we were coming to the end of that and 
realized that there was a lot that wasn't said.  Specifically the Canal Way was not really, uh, was 
not really very clearly flushed out in any of those.  So we began a new planning exercise about 
two years ago.  That oh, actually (--)
O:  So that wasn't in this (--) So that is what I was going to ask you.
S:  It was in the brown book, the idea.  The basic idea, the germ of it was in the brown book.  But
it wasn't in any kind of detail and it was just a suggestion.  It was there when we went looking for
it.  [O:  Since your work now are you largely trying to implement the plan or do you have like, 
uh, things that come up, I guess the canal would be an example, but ideas that come in over the 
(trans-summer?)?]  All of those, all of those.  And that is what makes it fun and that's what makes
it also very hectic.  Uh, we are trying to implement, again, another one of my criteria for coming 
here was that so many planners work on plans only and they never see the things that they 
worked on come to flourishing.  And what was really nice here was that I would have a chance 
both to work on the plans and to have something to do with making it happen and I enjoy that 
mixture, the idea that you'd have a little bit of each.  So uh, so, in the early years, I would say it 
was probably 75% getting this (--) These two documents, this is our preservation plan in these 
two documents.  Getting this together, okay.  And then identifying a bunch of things in there that 
were to be implemented.  The thing is not all of them were all physical projects.  One of them, 
one of the most important ones, was the whole standards and the historic review process.  So that
was one that came directly out of that.  Another one was the trolley project which was a whole 
elaborate multi face system that has some construction components.  But it is a multi-year face 
kind of thing.  Uh, then they're also demonstration projects that were in the clan.  Uh, some of 
those land up being (--) Some of those also were programs.  Like setting up the basic grant 
program.  Uh, those kinds of things.  And also find tuning it and so forth.  I don't personally get 
involved in all the administration of every grant, but the whole idea of uh, how are we going to 
get the word out, how are the grants going, do we need a workshop?  Because the point of the 
grants was that was a way, it was very much tied with the preservation standards.  In other 
words, we were going to set these high standards, but we were willing to help pay for it in the 
first years.  Uh, but that meant that there was a big burden on us, that the first grant project had to
be done really well because they were going to be used as the model.  So even though I wasn't 
directly managing the grants project, I cared a lot of how they were doing and how they were 
written about and how they were seen, because I was at the same time trying to lobby this whole 
standards ordinance through.  And if people were having bad experiences trying to do good 
preservation through the grant program, it is a small town and it was going to come back on us.  
Uh, so, again there have been those kinds of broad things.  Plus then I also worked on specific 
projects.  Uh, the way roles kind of develop, uh, as we begin putting together things like the 
Boarding House Park or the Cultural Center, uh, we usually, we always use outside architects and
engineers and designers to do these things.  We couldn't possibly do them all in house.  It is a 
huge volume of work.  What that means is that somebody has to go out and pick the designer and
to work with them on the contract and the program really saying what is this place suppose to be 
all about.  
S:  So I've worked on each of the projects in the early planning stages of them.  For example the 
Mogan Center.  I was the liaison with the architect there.  Uh, helping to make clear to them what
the program was of all these tenants and at them time it kept changing who was really going to 
be in the building.  It was a fairly interesting process in itself.  So, I worked at the early stages of 
all of our development projects.  The Mogan Cultural Center was one.  Now that it is under 
construction I have really passed that one to the construction people.  The Boarding House Park 
is another one that is right opposite the center that is about to go out on bid now that we have 
been working on.  [D:  So is the Board that the main mechanism by which local input comes into
the process of as projects are formulated?]  You mean the Historic Board is a regularity agency 
that separate from the Commission.  The Commission has one member on it, or the Executive 
Director of the Commission is on the Historic Board.  [O:  Then there is also the Board of 
Trustees for the Commission.]  The Commission itself is (--) The reason we named it the Historic
Board is just so we wouldn't get those two confused.   Most, most regularity groups that regulate,
uh, work on old buildings in Massachusetts cities are called Historic Commissions.  But because 
we are called the Preservation Commission we said let's call it the board just so we wouldn't get 
it confused.  Okay.  So uh, the Historic Board is a city agency that was created by state law.  It 
turned out we had to get, uh, we had to go through the state legislature to have it created.  There 
were a bunch of reasons for that.  Uh, it has a number of local people and federal people on it.  
Nothing can be built in the Historic District of Lowell, which is a very large district.  It includes 
about 800 structures without a permit.  They have to review everything.  According to 
preservation standards and standards for new constructions that we developed as part of this 
plan.  Those standards are in here.  And they adopted them.  Uh, and lobbying foreign and 
structuring that as you can imagine was one of the more fascinating things that you ever have a 
chance to do as a planner, or as anyone.  It was very interesting and pretty wild, let's put it that 
way.  
D:  Just backing up for a minute.
S:  Yeah.
D:  Uh, designation of the Historic District, where in the process did that come?
S:  Uh, it was done in a couple of faces.  The National Park and Preservation District was set up 
in the legislation at the outset.  That was really done before the serious inventories were done.  It 
was done just based on this early one.  It had a general idea.  Uh, but then uh, as part of the 
planning process here in say 79-81 there was a lot more research done on all the structures.  We 
then used that as the basis to make the Historic District, which is the Review District, which is 
slightly smaller than the Preservation District.  It's similar.  But we work that out in our office 
what our proposal would be.  Uh, the other thing that we did, which there were a lot of things in 
the ordinance that we are very proud of, they were very clever that, uh, make it flexible.  It had to
be created by state law.  But we set it up so that the boundaries can be changed locally without 
going back to the legislature.  There is a risk involved in that, too, though.  Because it meant that 
in the early years, that if they didn't like how it was going the city council could shrink it down to
one building.  And there was nothing anybody could do about that.  What's happened is that uh, 
they haven't shrunk it down, they expanded it.  Uh, St. Peters Church was threatened and it 
turned out that the city itself was having a big fight with the Archdiocese, who announced one 
day that they were going to tear the building down.  And as a matter of fact, a lot of it was in our 
office.  Uh, Rose Marie and Ruth were tearing out their hair and saying what can we do, what 
can we do?  And this was sort of bustling around.  And all of a sudden it occurred to me that uh, 
all they had to do (--) The City Council just had to vote to extend the district, and include the 
building, and they couldn't get a building permit to demolish it without getting a permit from the 
review board.  And the review board wasn't going to give them a permit to demolish it.  So in one
week we saved the building using our ordinance.  
D:  So it has really become a mechanism.
S:  Uh hmm.  The thing is it is very flexible.  It can be used that way if the members see fit and 
the council is behind it.  By the same token it can also be weakened if they choose not to.  But 
(--)  [D:  In the situation that you just described is where the impulse came through within the 
Commission.]  Well that was really more, that was really more the neighborhood and they had 
been asked (--) They were both people who lived in the neighborhood.  They were asked by their
neighbors to see if they could help and what they could do because they were considered kind of 
ineligible because they worked at the commission.  So, uh (--)  [D:  Have there been any cases 
where if it is coming from the city council to adjust lines of oath?]  Uh, not a specific case, 
because I think we created a pretty good size district.  So most of the (--)  There have been 
issues, there have been some conflicts with owners who wanted, specifically wanted to demolish 
buildings, but everything was in the district.  Uh, there is one kind of touchy one over by the 
hotel.  We drew the line down the middle of the Concord River.  And Chevy's decided to open 
and put neon around, all around their restaurant, which I personally don't think is so terrible.  I 
think it is kind of colorful.  I sort of like it.  But there was on one side of the canal, or one side of 
the river, there is all kinds of review and on the other side there is nothing.  Uh, but it was a give 
and take.  We wanted to make it small enough to be palatable.  And if anybody felt strongly 
enough about it, they can expand it.  Again, we were just providing some good tools and the idea 
was that (--)  I mean I make a lot of analogies with being a parent.  You want them to finally be 
independent.  You give them everything that you can, but you are not going to be there all the 
time and you hope that they uh, can use what you have given them and if they can't, they can't.  
At some point you do the best you can.  
D:  What was the grant process like and was it (--)
S:  Running interference.  Hardly.  We were much more, uh, we went out looking for projects I 
would say.  Rather than waiting for people to come to us.  It was more when we saw something 
horrible happen, like in this building, okay, it was under renovation when the park was created 
and they were ripping out, they had ripped the historic windows, and what they were putting in 
were so awful looking and I mean that is probably the single most design feature of a building is 
the windows.  Uh, what they were about to put in were so awful, uh, and of course, the natural 
argument is "how can you expect us to do something different than this, it will cost too much."  
And we could say, well we will give you some money if (--)  Uh, we couldn't put back with any 
reasonable budget what had been here.  But at least we put some money into (--) So it wasn't as 
horrible as it might have been.  There have been a couple of grants like that.  Where we actually 
put money into something to correct another renovation that had been bodged.  Uh, although it is
not something that we wanted to do.  I mean we felt that it was necessary.  The most obvious one
of that was the old fire station on the corner of Middle and Palmer Street was done, was 
"renovated"  which I put in quotes by blocking in all the windows with white stucco and putting 
these little [UNCLEAR] holes.  Okay.  And what happened is people went around criticizing it 
and sort of poking fun at it to the point where no one would rent space from it.  And uh, Paul 
Tsongas among them and the guy who owned it just couldn't make a go of it, and sold it to 
someone else.  Then the new owner came in and said "okay I would like to do this right".  It is 
still not up to what we would have preferred, uh, it is still not up to the standards, but at least it 
its a whole lot better than it was.  But, you know, the early grant program, we were developing 
the standards at the same time as we were giving out the first grants,  which was good because in
a way the program was kind of based on reality.  I mean there is a whole (--) I am sure you 
picked it up.  There is a whole attitude on behalf of the people who work for the Commission and
be very practical and very realistic.  We are not a bunch of Ivy Tower Preservationist, there are 
impurist.  There are plenty of Preservationist that are like that, who think it's not worth doing 
unless you do the absolute perfect, perfect, uh, 100% job.  Which can include tearing a building 
down to restore it to what, you know.  I mean that is obviously not our philosophy.  So, we were 
working with all kinds of funny owners as you would guess.  I mean some of them were very 
savvy and sophisticated and others were just, you know, ran some other business and happened 
to own this building and they didn't know the first thing (--) One of the biggest problems was a 
lot of them didn't see why you needed an architect to fix up a building.  They thought you just go
in and do it.  So they would start work and they would call up and say "hey Chuck, come here 
and look at this.  What do you think of this?"  No plans, no designs.  And when you are giving 
out federal money you can't quite operate like that.  But we were really trying to be responsive to
what (--)  We weren't coming in as a bunch of outside experts telling people what to do.  We were
trying to build some trust and have them see us as a resource and use us uh, before we started 
throwing the book at them.  Now we throw the book at them.  [LAUGHING]  Partly we have to. 
Partly we've been required to also.  We've done a lot of things.  Being an independent agency we 
are not part of the Park Service, uh, there are a lot of things that we're just not clear how we were
suppose to do things.  And nobody really told us.  So we just invented our own ways.  And uh, 
we went among our merry way I would say, for a fairly long time until just the volume of work 
got to be too much.  We needed help.  Uh, we went to the Department of Interior that has 
contracting and land acquisition people and so forth, in Boston, to see if we could borrow their 
services.  They said, sure.  And then they said, that's how you've been doing it and that is how 
you have been doing.  Well now you have to do this.  So we have become a little bureaucratic 
because we have to.  We need their help.  Uh, and we have to go through their procedures.  A lot 
of these things still is not clear whether we have to by law or not, but they are just sort of 
common practice and so we do it.  Uh, (--)
O:  So uh, you mentioned somebody was a top down planner and that was different from your 
approach.  What do you mean by top down planner and what other alternatives are there?
S:  Well, basically someone who feels that because of their training and their understanding of 
the complicated issues and they make a big thing of things being so complex and technical uh, 
that no one could possibly understand all the ratifications of these things but them, but experts.  
And they therefore should uh, should uh (--)
END OF SIDE ONE
BEGINNING OF SIDE TWO
SIDE TWO BEGINS WITH INFORMANT IN MID-SENTENCE:  Uh, that no one could 
possibly understand all the ratifications of these things but them, but experts.  And they, 
therefore, should uh, should uh, put together the ingredients and lay out the plan.  But in my 
experience it simply doesn't work.  That's not uh, it doesn't work and they are good for it.  And 
when you are talking about a city you are talking about (--) I mean nobody can possibly 
understand everything.  Uh, you are dealing with so many different forces that it has to be a 
disciplinary approach.  And quite often the real knowledge of what ought to be done and how 
things ought to happen is held by people in that community rather than any experts.  If you are a 
good listener, and I really believe that the planners job is to sort out and organize the ideas that 
are advanced and put them together in a way and help point out the (--) Maybe the possible 
conflicts.  In other words uh, this group may feel very strongly that easily access in and out of 
the city is of prime importance and therefore you should build a highway, however, while you are
building that highway this other group sees that there are all these very important historic 
buildings in the way.  You can't have both, do you realize that?  Uh, and what you are doing is 
making those issues clear and helping point them out and also looking for an imaginative way of 
is there some way to move that highway over.  Or to provide a trolley system so that you don't 
need the highway, that satisfies both parties.  But the basic ideas and the basic uh, notions come 
from the people, the local people who are most knowledgeable about it.  It doesn't mean you 
don't use outside experts.  I mean we called on all kinds of people who are very knowledgeable 
about history and technology and the whole variety of fields uh, as well.  I wouldn't say you only
listen to the man on the street and you never listen to any one else, obviously.  But it's being kind
of the vehicle for taking all those uh, all those notions and ideas, and a lot of data and 
information that you may know uh, and putting it together in a clear manageable form so that 
people understand what the choices are.  Uh, and what it is likely to be like if (--) What it is 
going to feel like if you carry these things out.  Uh, I think uh, my training has been uh, has been 
not exclusively in physical planning but there has been an orientation in that direction.  So, you 
tend to finally get down to what building are going to be built, and how are they going to be 
regulated, and how they are going to be used.  So there is a pretty physical (--)  And I think that, I
mean that's frankly how the American planning system is based.  The one, really serious uh, the 
only really serious planning mechanism in this country is zoning and land use control.  I mean 
there are a number of other things that effect uh, how human settlement occurs, but the most 
significant one is zoning and that is a very physically based land use control.  And finally (--)  I 
mean that is why I keep emphasizing the standards thing.  I am sure 99% of the people who you 
will talk to here, if they talk about what has been important in Lowell, they will not mention the 
Historic Ward, they will not think of it.  It sort of is subliminal.  Uh, but I think it's probably 
made more difference as to what the shape or the character of this community than any other 
single thing.  Uh, and that is something that I personally get kind of excited about.  Because it is 
something that has an enormous potential and can be used in (--) It can work or you, it can be 
tailored to suit your local situation, which is what we did here.  Uh, it is a very (--) The ordinance
we have is very, very strong.  Uh, but it ranked true because it was based on the local experience.
I mean, I listened to a lot of people and I saw what they were going through.  And one of the 
biggest things was that they didn't understand the rules.  And I heard so many people saying, "we
are willing to follow strict rules, we just want to understand them, make them clear."  
O:  So what were mechanisms for local input?  Were you at meetings or did you go out and 
solicit?
S:  Well, for one thing, the commission itself is kind of a cross section.  Uh, so there were people 
on the commission who worked on it.  Uh, we submitted drafts, there were a sub committee in 
the city council that had a few people on it.  And then we submitted drafts (--)  One of the big 
issues was who should be on it, who should be represented.  There are a lot of different (--)  
There is a Chamber of Commerce, realtors, and lawyers, and architects, and all these various 
groups.  So we found kind of someone to represent the uh, various parties.  Uh, but also it was 
(--) There was a public hearing, most of it we did informally.  We sent versions of it around and 
showed it to people and asked them for comments.  There was one city counselor, one of the 
guys who has been in the papers a lot lately, who just had a thing about it that he just thought was
wrong.  And he made a personal point of going through it with a fine tooth comb and just saying 
what about this, but what about this.  And never ever excepting, uh, anything as the final version.
I mean, he was very quick to find fault, but we kept changing it and modifying it to (--)  You 
know, most of the suggestions were reasonable ones.  It's just that if you made one change in one
area to satisfy one person then it also effected somebody else.  Uh, people knew we were 
working on it, it was talked about each month in the Commission meeting, we sent drafts around 
to lots of people, anybody who wanted a copy was certainly welcome to it.  I mean, it was a very 
open process.  We weren't (--)  And the grant recipients, you know the property owners, were 
probably the ones we listened to the most and with good reason.  If the people who are going to 
be regulated supported.  That is why it finally why it passed, I think.  Because the property 
owners said this will simplify our review process.  We want this.  This city council said "well 
fine."  The rules apply to them.  If they like it, uhm (--)
D:  So there was an existing structure there?
S:  Well there's no organization of property owners.  We knew them through the grant programs, 
you know.  
D:  There was (--)  Were there zoning [UNCLEAR]
S:  Yeah, this works with the existing zoning ordinance.  There had been a previous Historic 
Commission.  Not our Preservation Commission.  There was a previous Historic Commission 
that was set up under state law, uh, that was very weak and didn't do very much, and that was a 
source of a lot of confusion and a lot of questions.  People kept saying "well if we have this 
commission then what is wrong with it?"  And they were actually wound up being  with people 
who had been involved with setting that up, were the only real opponents because they kind of 
had a stake in this.  They had been on this Commission, and they had help set it up, and they 
didn't see what was wrong with it.  It wasn't that old.  So they took a lot of (--)  As a matter of 
fact, this one city council who was against it, I finally realized that he had been the one who had 
proposed the original Commission.  He didn't see what was wrong with it.  That's where we had 
to go back to the legislature because we had to abolish the existing commission that had been 
setup by the state.  Uh, so it was (--)
D:  Can you give a resemblance of people who have been important sources of local knowledge 
of these places?
S:  Uh, it terms (--) Well, there's so many it is sort of hard to know where to start.  Uh, well one 
is Armand Mercier who was with the Commission, uh, who just, uh, was a wealth of information
about people and how they did things, and buildings and who would own them, and why they 
were objecting to a certain thing.  Uh, "oh, it has to do with (--)", you know.  Our secretary in the
office, okay, Mary [Keofice?] who went all through grade school with Louie Saab, who is one of 
the biggest property owners in the city, and would tell me about how as an 8 year old kid would 
go to the candy store and buy penny candy for five cents, and get a whole big bag full and sell it 
for two cents a piece, and make a bundle.  You know, it helped you to understand where this guy 
was coming from and [UNCLEAR]  [LAUGHING]  Uh, there is literally so many people who 
just walk in off the street.  I mean, I think you have seen it while you have been there, it goes on 
now.  People come in and say "You know, I got this house or building, is it important or what is 
the deal?  Can I get money for this?  Or what should I be doing?"  and you look through the 
inventory and sort of help them understand it.  But a lot of times, I mean, you never know, uh, 
people are very unassuming here, uh, so somebody will show up in work clothes and boots and 
so forth, and own fifty buildings in the neighborhood and be one of the best healed landlords, uh,
around.  You, literally, just never know.  But there is a real direct connection.  People tend to be 
involved personally with their projects and what they are doing.  And I just use this as an 
opportunity to just kind of ask them about things and, uh, we also have done, especially in the 
early years, we did a lot of (--) We did workshops and sort of had a local preservation conference
for the first couple of years.  And we asked questions, we were giving information about our 
grant programs.  But it was an informal thing.  And then you just bump into people that 
remember you from whatever.  Uh, (--) [O:  Is there a (--)  Does your work (--)  Is there a cultural
plan for the city, too?]  Just recently there has been [O:  Uh huh.] a couple of weeks ago, and I 
worked on that with them.  [O:  So how does your, how does the cultural plan relate to the 
Preservation Plan?]  Preservation plan?  [O:  Yeah.]  Uh, there's (--)  For one thing, the cultural 
plan was just published two weeks ago.  [O:  Uh huh.]  Uh, when they were putting together the 
group to do the cultural plan, uh, the first thing that they did was to review the existing planning 
documents and realize that a lot of what we were talking about, I mean a lot of the things in our 
plan are for cultural facilities and I mean the whole National Park is the biggest cultural facility 
in some ways.  [O:  Uh hmm.]  Uh, the biggest single thing, I am not saying it is the only thing 
going by any stretch of the imagination.  But it is a major thing in the city.  Uh, so we had a lot to
do with setting up the planning process for that.  Uh, I was on one of the sub committees.  They 
broke it down to half a dozen committees, and there was one on amenities and I think it was 
called the Amenities Committee, it was sort of a physical outdoors space committee.  
O:  I don't understand what the objective of the Cultural Plan (--)  I mean I understand the 
objective of the preservation Plan, but the Cultural Plan I am not quite sure what it, uh, what it is 
for?
S:  What it is for?  [O:  Yeah, what it is?]  Uh, the idea was that there is a  lot of institutions and 
organization doing a lot of things.  Some of them may be overlapping.  I mean to give you a real 
simplest reason for it, people were being asked for money, companies and so forth.  And what 
they wanted to know was, which should we support?  Which ones are the most important and are
really (--)  If we can't give to everybody, how should we know are the most important?  And how
can we combine our resources to make sure the most important things happen.  That simply was 
the main reason for it.  Because they saw (--)  Lowell has been a model in a lot of ways for 
successful planning in general.  They saw that by putting together the Preservation Plan, and the 
General Manager Plan, and there was another City Development Plan, that by laying out what 
was most important to people and what should happen first, it gave us the chance to get our act 
together and agree to some things and to drop other things.  And then we were able to go ahead 
in this really complicated thing.  Uh, because we had set the basic ground rules and the Cultural 
Community said "gee, this is a interesting way to do this.  Why don't we try using the same 
approach?"  Uh, I think it also had to do with the mess, uh, counseling the arts, wanting them to 
find a community.  I think they offered some money.  But wanting to find a community that was 
ready to do this sort of thing.  Because they were moving in that direction, too.  but the way that I
understand it, and I've heard it said, Larry [Anson?] who is the owner of Joan Fabrics, who has 
been very involved in the physical planning things here, suggested he is also quite interested in 
the arts.  He said "we have a plan for other things.  Why don't we have a plan for this?"  And he 
was the one who went to the Mass Council and kind of hooked with them and got the thing 
going.  [O:  Oh, I see.]  And, again, when there's a document that's going to have to be, uh, out 
there, we take these plans seriously.  So it was circulated around to a number of people and it 
was set up to be consistent with things that we were going to be doing.  In other words, they 
didn't propose a lot of wild ideas, or a lot of things that were going to be impossible.  It made 
them spend a lot time with the commission and say "what do you do?  What can you do?  What 
can you do well?  And what can't you do?"  
O:  What were some of the examples of the areas of consistency?
S:  Uh, well they picked up on what we're doing over in the Boott Mills area, for example, with 
the Performing Arts Park, and the Mogan Cultural Center, and the Boott Mills Programs.  Uh, 
and, uh, rather than proposing say a new mechanism for something, if the wanted to do outdoor 
performances instead of saying "there should be a performance area somewhere" they knew that 
this was coming and they said "this should be used as a prime downtown performance area.  The 
other big one was on this Canal Way issue.  They picked up our linear park idea along the Canal 
Way and kind of folded it in.  They picked up on an idea that we have been talking about at the 
lower locks of really emphasizing that as an evening and entertainment area and did more work 
on that, flushing that idea up.  
O:  With the participating cultural organizations in this [UNCLEAR] arts agencies, or groups, 
[UNCLEAR]
S:  Yeah, the audience was different.  Yeah, the audience was different.  They, uh, they got 
involved with individual artists as well as all kinds of civic (--) A lot of it was to do an inventory 
of all these groups and people and where are they, and what did they (--) They did some surveys, 
uh, they also did audience surveys of people who use arts, uh, and cultural facilities and also who
don't.  In other words, people in the surrounding area, they did a good market setting on "do you 
come to Lowell?  And if not why not?"  and some stuff that we are quite interested in, too.  Uh, 
most of it reenforced what we knew, but it is good to have done.  So, we piggyback on their 
market studies sometimes for ideas.
D:  If I could go back to the physical [S:  Sure.  Uh huh.] part.  How, what are the dynamics of 
the Historic Board, how does that work out and has it changed all over time?
S:  Uh, to be honest, right now, uh, I don't know exactly what the Historic Board is doing day to 
day, because it's one of these children, okay, that is off more on it's own.  Uh, no I shouldn't say 
that I don't know anything about it.  Uh, it's working fine.  One of the main things that we setup 
is that it would have it's own administrator.  That was probably the single, biggest complaint that 
we heard, is that there's nobody to deal with and there is nobody who really knows.  They have a 
very capable administrator who handles the permitting process and the review process so well, 
uh, (--)  There some, there have been some problems I understand about, recently about the 
Historic Board not being as strict as we would prefer them to be.  In other words, the idea in 
theory is that they will be just as exacting as we are on our grant program.  But you understand 
that they review everything, not just people who are getting grants.  And I understand from 
talking with Chuck Parrot mostly in our office who's more involved in the day to day (--) He 
does the design review every week and I go very occasionally now.  Uh, that there being a little 
easier on people then we would have been, that we prefer them to be.  There may be (--)  I think 
in the very first year there was, it was a big deal, the first couple of years, it was a big deal and 
people took it very seriously and with anything like this it is kind of waining a little bit and some 
of the members have resigned and they're kind of, it's not as, it's not seen as so glamorous to be 
on it.  So it's gotten a little bit more, uh, hum drum.  But that's uh, it also hasn't had a legal 
challenge.  It was set up in 84', okay, and I don't think there is a stricter historic ordinance in 
Massachusetts anyway.  I really don't know that much about all over the place.  But, uh, it has 
not (--) It saved a number of buildings.  When they really have had to go to bat, they have.  The 
Bridge Street Boarding House, uh, had a demolishing permit before them, uh, and if it hadn't 
been for the Historic Board really saying no, that would have been torn down.  Uh, so, it's 
working.  It's maybe not perfect but I think it is working.
D:  From your perspective as a planner, uh, how would you characterize the changes that have 
taken place in the downtown area?  Not just the physical stand point, but in terms of commerce, 
street life, whatever.
S:  Uh, well it's been, it's obviously been very dramatic.  every time someone asks me for slides, 
it happened this morning, and I go back and you start telling them "you wouldn't believe what 
this place looked like when I came here, and not so long ago, eight years ago."  But I look at the 
pictures again and I don't believe it.  Uh, just the (--)  There's always been an act of street life 
here.  I mean, we're not claiming that this is a ghost town and there was no one here and we 
brought people here.  There has always been plenty of people downtown.  But the atmosphere 
and what they were walking through and around was pretty depressing.  And I think anyone you 
talk to will, will agree to that.  Uh, (--)  [D:  UNCLEAR]  Yeah.  [LAUGHING]  You know, you 
know what were talking about.  Uh, there are differences in the mix of people I think that you 
see.  I mean, right now there are a lot of, uhm, office workers and companies and so forth, that 
are downtown or close to downtown, uh, that are mixing in with other people who are (--)  There 
are a lot of services that are here and they were always here.  There are social services offices 
and insurance companies and banks.  There has always been kind of a steady [UNCLEAR] and 
those tend to draw people from the whole community, so that people still come downtown or 
have been coming downtown for those kinds of things for a long time.  But now the mixture of 
all those people together is kind of fun.  And the park visitors are an important factor.  I mean, 
that's the one single new group, and it is very noticeable in the summer with these large groups 
of people being led around by rangers.  And especially in the first few years, it was, uh, people 
thought this was pretty wild to see the idea of a park ranger who they imagined (--) And some of 
them were from Arizona, and New Mexico, and Montana.  The idea of them leading someone 
around Lowell was kind of fun, you know.  It was different.  Uh, but the funny thing is that now 
we are so use to things being pretty attractive here and the quality of workmanship and both in 
the individual buildings and in the streets and so forth.  This is really first class.  This is a very 
distinctive looking city and it, uhm, it's really in quite good shape.  Uhm, people really forget 
because it is so natural, the whole, all the preservations standards, the goal is to bring the 
buildings back to the way they were built.  Maybe not precisely in every way when you can't, uh,
if you can't recreate something exactly you do something that is sympathetic, or you use what is 
there.  So, it seems so natural that people sometimes don't realize that anything has been done.  
They think it was always like this.  And what they don't realize is that all the building have been 
covered over with aluminum and plastic in the 50's and it's that stuff that is being removed so it's 
got back, but they assume it has always been that way.  And so you almost wish (--)  I think we 
really have a need now for more before pictures to show people how far we've come.
S:  Uh, the other thing that I think we are just on the threshold of, is we have created a lot of new 
places that just didn't exist before like the Market Mills as a place.  Like the Lower Locks and 
several others that are just really good urban spaces and they were well thought out, they were 
designed using what was there, but they are new places.  And, uh, I think that is one of the 
reasons that people who come here really, who notice them, I think it is hard to not notice it.  
They appreciate it, they are interested in it, and it is the whole idea of the space conveys a lot to 
them.  It's a battle that I am having personally with the National Park Service, because I think 
that they (--)  A number of the Park Rangers, and the park interpreter program has gotten a little 
too far in the direction in telling a story and giving a message and forgetting the place.  And 
they're ignoring were they are and trying to kind of protect people from the city.  There are a lot 
of talk of how dangerous the traffic is and telling horror stories which I went incognito on a park 
tour, I think I told you about this recently, and had this experience, there was a new ranger who 
didn't recognize me and I said I will just blend in with the crowd here.  Because I figured he 
doesn't know me, I don't know him either.  You know I don't know him, he doesn't know me 
either.  And I was very horrified by what he did, and I made a huge stick about it, and it's still (--)
O:  What did he do?
S:  Uh, Just very anti-city kind of stuff.  He was going on and on about, he had a theme talk that 
he was doing, tour that he was doing on the [UNCLEAR] girls and immigrants.  That was the 
theme and context style production.  And he was belaboring facts to the point where people were 
just bored.  I mean, it was the same thing over and over and over and over again, and ignoring 
where they were.  I mean, he should have done the whole tour inside of a building if he was 
afraid to have them cross the street and afraid to have them (---) I mean he just was not using the 
setting at all.  Uh, which was a waste.  And he was fighting it.  He was taking them on a route 
that they seemed to be avoiding mixing with local people.  He was so worried about keeping his 
group of thirty people together and controlling them, and again their educational, uh, analogies 
here, uh, old fashioned teachers tried to control their students and people who were a little more 
savvy about how people learned, let them interact with their environment and understand that 
you learn through experience and he's trying to make sure that they have his experience rather 
than letting them have their own.  
O:  And possibly learn more or something.
S:  Yeah.  It is a big debate going on within the park service over whether ranger guided tours or 
self guided tours make more sense, and obviously you should be doing some of each.  Uh, but it 
was interesting when I, uh, brought this up with the chief of interpretation, because I wanted to 
find out how much this guy's personal style verses how much was the program and what I was 
concluding was that a lot of it was probably the program.  And I think that I was right, but I was 
asking him about it and he said they can't possibly, there is so much changing and so much 
happening that the rangers are reluctant to talk about what is going on in this building or that 
building because they may be wrong.  Uh, and I said look if that's the problem, if they are 
uncomfortable, if they are not feeling up to date on all these things changing, you know, I am 
across the street.  Do you want me to come have lunch with the park rangers once a week?  I 
mean that's what we are there for.  Uh, and just talk about what is going on.  Because they were 
just so off base and misrepresenting what was happening.  I mean, they do have a large route, 
and it is a big area, and there is a lot to be up to date on.  But, uh, I think it should be part of their
(--)  I mean they should (--)  They are the greater publics contact with this city.  They are, they 
maybe the only person that a tourist talks to when they are here.  And if they are giving this 
anti-city and negative thing about, uh, well you know that building is just falling down and 
nobody cares, when it is a building that everybody is working on renovation plans and it is just 
taking a while to get the plans together.  I mean that's, that, we really feel that very much we are 
all in this together [O:  Yeah.]  and that there are emissaries or whatever you call it, and they are 
misrepresenting what is going on here.  So, uh.  In the olden days, in the first years, we use to 
fight a lot with the park service.  Lately, we've all gotten to be (--)  You know, we resolved our 
basic agreements, and we all know each other, and we have been working together for a long 
time.  And we've, uh, tend to be protective.  
O:  Who fought?  The Commission with the Park Service and planners.
S:  Yeah, yeah.  Both.  I mean there were some legendary, some legendary fights that we have 
that (--) Over where to put the Visitors Center, and which should be the Main Mill.  I mean 
everybody now knows that the Park Service is doing Boott Mill number 6 and that is where they 
are going to be.  But, the Park Service Planning Team that was here in the first couple of years, 
wanted the entire Park Service presence and operation to be over in the Wannalancit Mills, which
was a Mill that was only in the district as an after thought because there was some interesting 
textile operation going on there that closed.  It was not even suppose to be in the Park originally, 
but they decided and included in, you know, for some good reasons.  And then the planning team
arrived here and said "oh good."  "Well this is sort of removed from everything and we can 
control this."  There was a lot of that sort of talk.  "We can control this and we won't have to deal 
with the rest of the city."  And that was, and they were very adamant that this way, this was the 
expert version.  "We know, we know how to run, plan a National Park, we know how to do it 
best, and this is what we are going to do."  And we knew, uh, that it would (--) The National Park
as a revitalization tour would never happen if they did that.  Uh, there was a lot of vacant land 
across the street from it that would have been McDonald's, up and down, and fast food stuff.  I 
mean, it would have been all the things that people would have driven (--)  It is very good 
highway access.  People would have driven off the highway, gone to that, that would have been 
the National Park and then they would have left.  "I have been to the National Park."  But what 
we went through, I mean, Sunday morning meetings, and uh, just, it was tough because a lot of 
us, especially the Commission Staff were young people.  The Commission Members, they didn't 
have a lot of experiences, they were going by their gut feelings.  No one had done a National 
Park like this.  So it was just, they didn't (--) We were, in a lot of ways, it was very easy to be 
intimidated by the National Park people who were very sure of what they were doing.  They had 
done this a hundred times before, this is the way it is done, this is what works.  Uh, and it was a 
tough situation, but we just, we just knew we were right.  We just knew.  And we cared more 
about it finally than they did.  And we just, we fought them, and we had more stamen I think.  
Uh, and we were right.  We were right, finally.  And they did come around and they finally, they 
finally agreed with it.  But the one that keep coming in mind is the first park superintendent, Lou 
Albert, who was at a point when we were all literally at each other throats yelling and screaming 
in his office, he said "look, come on you guys, you know, in 50 or 75 years this will all work 
out."  And we said 50-75 years!  We've got 10 years, this thing is going to make it or not?  And 
that was his, he was trying to be [UNCLEAR]  But that was their time frame and gave us a real 
good understanding of the way they were looking at these things.  We didn't have that luxury of 
time.  [LAUGHING]
D:  So, how old are you?
S:  How old do you think?  Uh, I will be 38 in a couple of weeks.  I had to remember.  [D:  So 
you were about 31 when this all started?]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Not quite.  I was still in my 20's.  
[LAUGHING]  Yeah.  [D:  How about commerce?  Has it changed, gotten better, stayed the 
same, gotten worse?]  Uh, it's changed, uh, I don't know those are kind of suggestive statements I
guess.  Uh, there's (--)  Let's see what's the best way?
