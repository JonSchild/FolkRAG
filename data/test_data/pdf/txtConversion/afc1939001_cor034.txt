[Letter from Harold Spivacke to John A. Lomax;
University Station, Austin, TX]
April 28, 1939
Mr. John A. Lomax University Station Austin, Texas
Dear Mr. Lomax:
I have ordered the additional needles for you and they should reach you soon.
Your report is very encouraging indeed and I am anxiously looking forward to the
opportunity of hearing about it from you personally.
The batteries were shipped by our mail division and I presume emptied by them. Perhaps
the express company insists on this. But at any rate I am glad to hear that they are
working again.
I only receive very sketchy reports from Alan. In fact I feel that I must talk to him about this
when he next comes to Washington.
Sincerely yours,
Harold Spivacke Chief, Division of Music
