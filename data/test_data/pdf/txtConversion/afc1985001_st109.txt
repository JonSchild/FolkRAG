The Three Crows
THE THREE CROWS 5030 A3
Sue Putnam Cassadaga, N.Y.,1941
There were three crows sat on a tree And they were black as black could be.
Said one black crow unto his mate What shall we do for meat to ate?
There is a horse on yonder plain Was by some cruel butcher slain.
We'll sit upon him in the sun And pick his eyes out one by one.
