Jose.

(Amado Valdez, a Cuban cigar maker of Ybor City, Tampa, Florida, reports that “Juan
Jose” is a novel written in Spain by Joaquin Vicenta, about 20 years ago. He says that until
1931 the cigar workers of Ybor City paid 25¢ each, weekly, to lectores who read novels
and newspapers in Spanish to the workers in the factories.
The Cigar Manufacturers' Association of Tampa, in 1931, alleged that the lectores were
disseminating strike propaganda, and so banned them from the factories. This resulted in
a bitter 10 months strike of the cigar workers. The cigar workers lost the strike.
(Amado Valdez says that the lectores read many such novels as “Juan Jose” to the
workers, who remembered them and often told them over to each other in abbreviated
forms.)
