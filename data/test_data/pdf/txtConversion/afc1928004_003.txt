When de soldiers at Point Isabel, 
Where in de greatest ob danger, 
He fought his way to gen'ral Taylor, 
Wid his gallant Rangers. 
For he am a 
fine young soldier, 
All ob de present time. 
An' den he told ole massa Taylor, 
Be dangers dey were in; 
So wid dere men dey started of, 
To relieve dat place again. 
In two days arter dey arrived. 
Brave Walker war sent hence,' 
To de camp near Matamoras, 
To gain some intelligence. 
For he am a 
fine young soldier, 
All ob (IF present time. 
An' when he got near to dat place, 
He heard most noble rumours. 
Dat Matamoras war destroyed, 
An' some hundred Montezumas. 
For daring bravery an' courage, 
De gallant Walker is de man, 
An' while we've such fearless %.aders, 
We'll neber fear de Mexicans. 
For he am a

In de battle on de eighth ob May, 
His horse from under him fell, 
Den four Mexicans attack'd him, 
But not one did live to tell.

THE GALLANT RIDGELEY,t 
.Ant:—The fine old t 
nglish geialemia. 
On Palos Alto's battle field, 
-Upon the eighth of May, 
Ringgold's gallant soul did yield, 
On that victorious day. 
'Twas then the noble Ridgeley 
Succeeded him in command, 
And there fought most merrily, 
For his dear native land. 
It was upon the death of Ringgoln, 
Ridgeley succeeded in command. 
There viet'ry crown'd the efforts strong, 
Of the patriot Rough and Ready, 
And Uncle Sam will march ere long, 
To Mexico quite steady. 
'Twas on the following morning bright, 
At Resaca de Palma's plain, 
True Yankee hearts, both free and light, 
Defeated the Mexicans again. 
It was upon the, &e. 
One battery of' the Mexic crew, 
Did pour upon us heavy, 
Creating such sad havoc too, 
That alarmed old Rough and Ready. 
The brave old soldier then did say, 
"Yon battery must.he ta'en," 
And such orders gave to Captain May, 
And his true gallant train. 
It was upon the, &c. 
Brave May, with heart as true as steel, 
Was rushing to the charge, 
When- 
noble Ridgeley did feel, 
For their dangers all at large. 
8 
He then exclaimed, tree from ire,t 
Unto the gallant Captain May, • 
“Hold, Charley, till Idraw their firer 
Then you'll be safe upon your way. 
It was upon the, &c. 
And then such thunder man ne'er heard, 
As from Ridgeley's artillery roared; 
'Twas quickly answeed by the :Vlexic herd, 
And May's dragoon's upon them poured. 
The battery soon did have to yield, 
To the valorous Charley May, 
And ' mongst the pris'ners of the field, 
Was the Mexic general Vega. 
It was upon the, &c, 
Poor Ridgeley, the gallant and gay, 
Who fought so brave, amid the strife, 
At Alto, Resaca, and Monterey, 
By sad accident has lost his life. 
Nov may his memory be enshrined, 
Bright on Fame's historic page, 
And with other heroes.be entwined, 
With liberty to the latest age. 
It was upon the, & c, 
GEN, WORTH AT MONTEREY 
Ax R—Rose of Alabama. 
Away down to Mexico, 
Across the Rio Grande, oh, 
With joyful hearts, we did go, 
With Worth to Monterey! 
Oh, gallant General Worth, 
Worth at Monterey, 
Brave as any in the fight, 
Was Worth at Monterey. 
9 
e 
s 
orm'd the heights of that place, 
Fought the Mexicans face to face, 
Till they all fled in a 
race, 
From Worth at Monterey! 
Oh, gallant, &c. 
And to their houses did retreat, 
Afraid the Yankees for to meet, 
And from their houses, in the streets, 
Shot the men of Gen'ral Worth. 
Oh, gallant, & c. 
Then to stop such dangerous sport, 
b 
To a 
new trick Worthdid resort, 
And made of every 'house a 
fort, 
To save his men at Monterey. 
Oh, gallant, & c. 
The Mexies sent a 
flag of truce, 
For Rough and Ready to peruse, 
To fight longer was no use, 
'Gainst Worth at Monterey. 
Oh, gallant; &c. 
The Yankee soldiers bravely fought, 
As Uncle Sam's boys always ought, 
And each to outstrive the other sought, 
With Worth at Monterey. 
Oh, gallant, & e. 
Then soon old Monterey did fall, 
Unto the patriot soldiers all, 
Which made Ampudia feel quite small, 
On seeing Worth in Monterey. 
011, gallant, &c. 
And now the nation does proclaim, 
The value of the soldier's fame, 
And may it always be the same, 
As Worth's at Monterey. 
Oh, gallant, & c.

He has again made de Mexicans fly: 
So wheel about upon de plain, 
An' eb'ry time you wheel about, 
Charge at de enemy again, 
Den you'll put 'em to de rout. 
Let *cm come in whateber numbers dey may, 
Said Taylor, I 
will fight an' win de day: 
So wheel about, &c. 
When he war marchin' through a 
narrow pass, 
De Mexicans fired,at him mighty fast: 
So wheel about, & c. 
Taylor said, friends, we must fight or perish 
If de land oh Washington we cherish: 
So wheel about, & c. 
Soon as de warrior said dey must be met, 
De soldiers charged wid de bayonet: 
So wheel about, & c. 
So dey went at it wid great slaughter, 
Like general Scott at Bridgewater: 
So wheel about, &c. 
To find de Yankees chargin' thus, 
Did wid de Mexicans create a 
fuss: 
So wheel about, &c. 
Dey couldn't stand such close quarter, 
So dey gib up to avoid more slaughter; 
So wheel about, &c. 
De Mexicans began dis bloody fray, 
Dey war in de wrong an' lost de day; 
So wheel about, &c. 
Den ole massa Taylor (rib it to 'em again, 
An' left twelve hundred dead upon de plain:

Were de last uttered by dying Ringgold:

It worked like India rubber. 
Oh, boys, your banjoes bring, 
In lub's softest manna,

'Bout Sue ob Indiana. 
On Blackberry hill,

No berry dar was sweeter.

Sonic berries for to choose 'em, 
She buried all my heart,

Oh, boys, &c. - 
She picked me one so merry, 
Black as her fair complexion,

Her sweet lip look'd so vexen. 
An' now worked up so merry,

Compared wid sich a—nigger.

He'll 'plit your wood so nice an' fine, 
Dat if you do employ him once, 
You'll be sure to get him next time. 
Poor black man's work am most run out, 
For coal am de fashion now to burn; 
De coal am hard but de times am harder, 
An' poor black man no money can earn

OENERALL,WASHINGTON. 
In ole-Virginny, dar War born, 
. . De greatest man under de sun; I. 
.gc'All folks say him mighty great, ) 
, 
An his name am Washington: 
'He first war sent to fort ,Du Quesne, 
Where de French an' Indians lay; 
Gin'ral Braddock he war lifted, 
An' Washington bring de men away. 
In seventy-four he went to congress, 
An' dar they thought him well, 
For John Adams, de patriot, said, 
Let's make him a 
general. 
De fifteenth ob June, in seventy-five, 
Congress sent him to Boston; 
Near dat town de soldiers were, 
Who beat de British at Lexington. 
He drill'd his men an' taught 'em how,. 
Wid muSkets an' wid rifles, - 
Dat dey could conquer when dey liked, 
' For de British were but trifles. 
He den sent word to general Gage, 
Who commanded de British forces, 
'Pat he must leabe ole Boston town, 
.Or else he'd meet wid losses. 
Ole general Gage den thought it best, 
To leabe widout any boder; 
An' as de British left one way, 
• 
Washington entered toder. 
He cross'd de Delaware one night,.. 
An' put dere army to de rout; 
For eight long years Washington, 
' Did chase de British about. 
,f3 At ;last in ole Virginny, 
0 
He hemmed 'ern in so tight, 
Dat Cornwallis did surrender, 
f 
Kase he could no longer fight. 
,1 
Den arter dat king George the third, 
Acknowledged we were free; 
It must hab went most mighty hard, 
But yet it had to be. 
Den when we framed de constitution, 
All hands dere voices sent, 
To him dat freed de 'Nited States, 
To be her first president. 
For twice four years he mildly sway'd, 
4 
De power ob our federal state; 
Dat rule has been observed since, 
An' de presidents serve but eight. 
He den retired to Mount Vernon, 
To end his days in quiet; 
But war soon call'd forth again, 
To qw.,11 do whiskey riot. 
Soon after dis treasonable event, 
De nation war call'd to mourn, 
He died December fourteen, flinty-nine, 
An' de nation war forlorn. 
When freedom's benefactor died, 
America did not alone bewail; 
De friends ob liberty ebery where, 
Join'd in de sad an' mournful trail. 
When nature's voice, in future eras, 
Asks, what is immortality? 
De lesson'd child an' trembling age 
Will triumphantly point to thee.

Dar is a

An' handles de quarters quite steady,. 
I

For you always find him ready. 
He roves about from city to city, 
An' razor strops he sells, 
Widout doubt he's bery witty, 
When ob his strops he tells. 
Who'll be de next customer? 
Widout a

Keen as a

A few more left—who'll try ? 
Does any one want tO buy ? 
Who'll be de next customer? 
He cum from ober de ocean, 
An' had ncr work to do; 
So to keep himself in motion, 
He started something new.

Ob his strops he'll sing. 
Who'll be de next, &e 
If you shell ober a

An' take a

Wid a

On a

An' your face as smooth you'll find, '**%

Cut de beard all off your chin.

Den you can shave widout pain, 
Or givin' your face a

DE NIGGER'S ADVICE, 
De white folks say, in Philadelphia, 
Dat no niggers hab a 
paradise; 
But if dey would go down an' see, 
In Small street, dere misery an' vice; 
Den dey might preach ob reformation, 
To better de cause of de nigger; 
But while dey talk ob amalgamation, 
Dey add but chains to de nigger's figger. 
Den white folks, why do you act dis way ? 
An' not take care ob de niggers dat's free, 
If you let de slave-holders hab dere own sway 
Den de slaves will hab more liberty. 
De south wont be drove on any condition, 
To surrender a 
right ob dere native land; 
But do time'll come far de slave manumission, 
An' den dey'll be a 
mighty strong band. 
I 
tell you how slavery you may banish, 
Jis take down south your abolition money, 
An' as you build factories de niggers'll vanish, 
Like a 
fly's life when it falls in honey. 
For de Yankee lads an' lasses ob de white race 
Dat work in de factories so gay, 
Will .drive Lie niggers away from dere places, 
Den dey'll hab to go ober to Africa.
