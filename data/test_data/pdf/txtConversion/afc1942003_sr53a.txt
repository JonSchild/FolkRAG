"Dear Mr. President", Bloomington and Mishawaka, Indiana, January 8, 1942
AFS 6455A
Kenneth Thurston: I am Kenneth Thurston a teacher in Bloomington, Indiana. Like most other
professional people paid from public funds, I'm wondering at this time as before my income will be
among the last to benefit from war prosperity. I'm willing to give up some luxuries and comforts
just like everyone else. But I'm afraid that soon this decreased purchasing power will also affect the
quality of my work simply because I won't have the funds to keep up the necessary professional
contacts. But I am glad to be a teacher in these days even though the financial outlook isn't bright.
It's a real opportunity and challenge to make people realize that people who are now our avowed
enemies will someday have to be respected as citizens of a new world for which this war is being
fought.
I feel that the job of preparing youth for the coming peace is as great a privilege as helping to win
the war. And I hope that as long as I teach I can always guide my pupils in their search for that truth
without which a lasting peace is impossible.
I want no one to think that the schoolroom is the only place I expect to serve in the days ahead. But
wherever and however I serve I want whatever I do to count toward winning the war . . . the peace as
well as the war.
