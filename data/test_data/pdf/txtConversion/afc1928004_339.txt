You and I, Carter's Parody 7 
Entered according to Act of Congress in the year 1876, by A. J. 
FISHER, in the office ot the Lihrarian of Congress, at Washington, 
Originally sung by V IRGINIA STICKNEY. 
ill tell you of the pet I 
love, 
But he proved false to me, his dove. 
He was as gentle as a 
lamb, 
He had a 
hand just like a 
ham, 
He's tall and slim, and oh so neat, 
You ought to see his great big feet. 
His nose is also plump and fat, 
It makes my heart go pitipat, 
To think if a 
bee on it would sit, 
He'd stay all day and sip and sip. 
He took me to a 
show one night, 
For he knew of course ' twould please me quite, 
And as we sat in the parquette, 
How nice I 
felt I 
scarce can say. 
The band it played, a 
lady appeared, 
And in comic song with voice so clear, 
Entrancing me with dashing style, 
While to my love she gave a 
smile. 
To see this mash next day he went, 
To pop the question was his intent. 
Alas poor me, I 
felt sore, 
To hear they'd left in a 
coach and four, 
My mother screamed and tore her hair, 
I 
tempted suicide in my despair, 
I 
tested Heidsick. in that I 
failed, 
So now I'm on the false

I 
NEVER REFUSE, 
Copyrighted 1876, and Music published by 13. IL HARDING, 229 Bovi-
ery,-.New York. 
Price 10 cents. 
I 
like to satisfy my friends, 
in everything I 
do, boys ; 
There's nothing small in me, at all, 
As a 
friend, you II find me true, boys. 
Good nature is my only fault, 
But that you must excuse ; 
Whatever you ask me, I 
shall do, 
oiotto is, " never refuse I " 
CHORUS. 
I 
never refuse, T 
never refuse! 
Invite me to oine, or pour out the wine; 
Suggest what you like, or ask what ylou choose, 
\ .N1 y 
motto thro' life is, " never refuse?" 
One night when coming from the play, 
My throat was feeling dry, boys : 
So I " dropped in 
and a 
cork " dropped out,', 
The drink was real 
old rye," boys! 
Just then, came in a 
dear old friend, 
iNotseen in years before; 
Our hands we entwined in a 
friendly grasp, 
And he begged me to take " just one more!" 
Spoken.—Well it would have been wagainst my principles to 
say no, so I 
just told him plainly that— 
I 
never refuse, Scc. 
I 
used to sing " My pretty Jane,.' 
When love's deep draught I 
swallowed; 
. 
And gave my sweetheart strawberry cream. 
To make myself more " solid." 
So. when I 
asked her for a 
kiss, 
She did not faint or cry ; 
No gentle rebuke, hut a 
whisper sweet, 
And this was her charming reply : 
CHORUS. 
I 
never refuse, I 
never refuse, 
Such love and delight, how could I 
refuse? 
You may say what you like, or ask what you choose, 
My motto through life is, " never refuse ! "

BILLY CARTER'S PARODY OF YOU AND I, 
SHE WOULD MASH. 
Originally sung by VIRGINIA STICKNEY. 
MUSIC 
by W ILLIAM CARTER. 
Come listen awhile to my tilt, 
I'm sure it won't hurt you a 
bit, 
if you don't like the style of my song. 
I'll very soon get up and git. 
One day I 
was walking the street, 
A 
fair damsel I 
chanced for to meet. 
I 
winked one eye—she looked one eye, 
And smiled on me ever so sweet. 
CHORUS. 
Her hair in golden ringlets hung. 
Her eyes were Heaven's own blue, 
Gaiters on her tiny feet 
I 
think were number two. 
Her form was most excplsite, 
Her style was all the rage, 
lint she would mash, you bet she would, 
For she was just the age. 
I 
asked her if she would be mine, 
She said she'd ask papa ; 
The old man thought I 
had more wealth 
Than the other one by far. 
So he gave his consent right away, 
And I 
thought I'd a 
dear precious wife, 
So I 
settled down, just outside of town, 
And intended to be happy through life. 
CHORUS. 
But when I 
went out to see the boys 
And left my wife at home, 
She said she was. 
contented 
And loved to be alone. 
But I 
saw her kiss a 
chap last night. 
Which set Inc in a 
rage, 
But she would, you know, of course she would., 
For she was jczt about the age.

We met and we dirted,.you and I, 
In a 
beer garden not long ago, 
And oh we were happy you and I. 
As the lager dov,vri our throats did flow, 
We threw two glasses, you and I, 
In the gutter as it glided on, 
While the Dutchman sadly us did eye, 
And the waiters as they slowly passed along; 
And oh we were broke then you and I, 
And felt that our life's pleasant dream, 
Must end, for the police very- soon 
Would find out what dead beats we had bees. 
We sat in th'e parlor, you and I, 
And married six months we had been, 
I 
thought we'd be happy, you and I. 
But soon found out that I'd been taken in, 
We fought like two eats then, you and I, 
And my hair, oh how tightly you hung on, 
You then hauled off and blacked my eye. [corn. 
While my nose looked like a 
half ehawed ear of

OUTS OF LIFE. 
driginally sung by VIRALNIA STIOKNEY. 
Now the song I'm going to sing to you, 
And what. it is about, 
If you give me your attention, 
You will quickly find it out, 
'Pis about the cutting affairs oflife, 
A 
savage subject but, 
'Tis none the less a 
true one—for, 
All nature has to cut, 
First the darling little baby, 
Cuts its darling little teeth, 
And the doctor cuts its little gums, 
To soothe its little grief, 
And when its a 
little older, 
It begins to cut up jack, 
Then its mama cuts a 
little switch, 
And cuts its little back. 
Now the butcher cuts your mutton chops, 
The cook cuts up your hash, 
The tailor cuts the dandy's coat, 
The dandy cuts a 
dash; 
Thd,ciretis down cuts capers, 
The ring master cuts the clown, 
And,then he cuts the horses up, 
To make then i 
go around. 
All the Dolly Vardens cut a 
swell, 
When they go on the street, 
Their shoes are cut so very-sruell, 
They cut their pretty feet. 
Should you tell them,that it cuts 7030:10Pheti 
To see them cut up so, 
They'll give you a 
cutting look and say, 
Now you just cut find go. 
Now employers cut your wages down) 
Such cuts you do not like, 
So you quickly tut f.Way from work, 
And cut ot , on a 
.
strike, 
There are love cuts and business cutet 
There's cuts of, every kind, 
Even little boys can't steal ,a ride, 
Without its cut behind, 
But of all theina.ny cuts of life, 
The unkindest cut of all, 
Is the cut an old friend gives you, 
When misfortunes onyou,fall, 
But there's a 
cut we all must feel, 
Before we end the strife, 
'Tis when death comes to close the scShit, 
Anti cuts the thread of life..

PRETTY LITTLE BLONDE. 
Originally sung by YIROINIA STICKNEY. 
Why do the men try to deny, 
They love that pretty girl. 
And then if they do pass her by, 
Just to give their eye a 
twirl; 
They cannot help it no they can't, 
I 
judge them by myself, 
For when f 
met that girl to-day, 
You know how it- 
is yourself. 
CHORUS. 
For oh, she was so handsome, 
And graceful as a 
fawn, 
flow could I 
help but love that girl, 
With all those nice clothes on, 
And when she cast that smile on me, 
I 
knew that I 
was gone. 
For oh, she was so nobby, ha, ha ; 
That pretty little blonde. 
, 
asked her if she'd walk with me, 
She smiled and answered yes. 
You should have seen me swell beside, 
That nobby, nice silk'dress, 
I 
asked her if she liked ice cream 
To cool her blushing tongue, 
iihe said she thought it would taste nice, 
With all those fine clothes on. 
For ela she -was, etc.

A 
handsome chap with a 
soldier's oup, 
Oaree tripping after me,

HE ISN'T 
AS RICH AS HE USED TO BE. 
Copyrighted 1876, and Music published by E. H . 
H ARDING, 229 Bow-
ery, New York. Price 10 cents. 
He isn't as rich as he used to be, 
His friends, they are growing few; 
When jolly and gay, in the days gone hy. 
Be found them a 
little too true. 
He wanders alone thro' the street so gay, 
And meets here and there a 
cool bow; 
But the friends of his pleasure in days gone by, 
Having nothing to say to him now. 
C
HORUS. 
For he isn't as rich as he used to be,' 
He's " down in the world," to-day • 
He knows what it is to be poor, my boys, 
And he meets not a 
friend in nis way. 
He sported himself like a 
prince around, 
And became a 
great friend of " the boys," 
Whenever his presence was known to them, 
They set up a 
flattering noise. 
The ladies all smiled as he passed them .by-, 
Their wishes he well could attend; 
He was loved and caressed like an angel blest., 
Because he had money to spend, 
For he isn't. ke. 
At night, in convivial joys he lived, 
And slumbered each day until noon, 
lie rode in his coach with a 
lady fair, 
And went off to the country in June .; 
But now, no one knows where he lives or goes, 
Some forget him and others despise, 
He feels the hard times, but he'll bear them well, 
Till, some day. in his garret he dies. 
For he isn't, &c. 
Words from the " Clipper," Composed and Sung by II. A. SELINGTON. 
The people have gone crazy, 
Away from all restraint ; 
For one and all, both great and small, 
Have got a 
strange complaint: 
It's spread the country over, 
From Texas up to Maine: 
A 
sort of epizooti — 
" 
Centennial on the Brain ! " 
Hurrah for.seventy-six, hurrah, and Yankee Doodledoo! 
Then beat the drums and ring the bells and blow the 
trumpets too ; 
Well never see so big a 
time in all this world again 
Oh! we are mad! Yes, got it bad—" Centennial on the 
brain!" 
We hear it gossipd over 
In all that people say, 
While children howl ; ind babies squall 
" 
Centennial," night and day. 
We get it for our dinner, 
And supper too aain; 
In fact we're almost crazy, 
" 
Cent tonal on the brain! " 
If things don't reach a 
ftycus 
Inside the present year, 
With one big crash, we'll go to smash, 
And leave this trouVed sphere. 
Some one will raise a 
tombstone, 
And write, in letters plain, 
This glorious country died of 
"Centenmal on the brain!" 
Originally sung by VIRGIN-IA STICKNEY. 
Have you seen my Molly Malloy, 
She looks so nice and gay, 
She's left me here to pine and die, 
For she has gone away, 
She ran away the other night, 
Which did my brain annoy, 
Last Friday night she did elope, 
With a 
Tipperary boy. 
Have you seen my Molly Malloy, 
She's gone with a 
Tipperary boy, 
Tipperary, Tipperary, Tipperary boy. 
It was outside her mother's door, 
She heard this fellow play, 
She sobbed and sigli'd and said oh my, 
He's stole my heart away, 
'Twas the music that enchanted her, 
Till her heart jumped like a 
toy, 
So last Friday night she skedaddled 
With the Tipperary boy 
I've searched the village through and through. 
But her I 
cannot find, 
I've wept till I 
can weep no more, 
My eyes are nearly blind; 
But if ever I 
come across them, 
I 
mean him and Molly Malloy, 
I'll put a 
head on her and choke 
The Tipperary boy.

EILEY MAVOURNEEll, 
Originally sung by VIRGINIA STICKNEY. 
The time has come, darling, for us now to part, 
Eiley Mavourneen, Eiley Machree, 
But still in your keeping dear safe is my heart, 
Eiley Mavourneen, Eiley Machree, 
The ship is now waiting out there in the bay, 
When daylight appears she'll be speeding away, 
Then good bye, my Colleen, is all left to say— 
Eiley Mavourneen, Eiley Machree. 
In that land of promise far out o'er the sea, 
Eiley Mavourneen, Eiley Machree, 
Is the home of the strangers, the home of the free, 
Eiley Mavourneen Eiley Machree. 
Then should we no more in this wide world of pain 
And fate should decide that we ne'er meet again, 
Then I 
should be left for to sigh all in vain, 
Eiley Mavourneen, Eiley Machree. 
Then kiss me good-
bye love and hope for the best, 
Eiley Mavourneen, Eiley Machree, 
Sure I 
know that your heart darling is sorely distressed, 
Eiley Mavourneen, Eiley Machree. 
'Tis to better my fortune that I

To Columbia's proud nation a 
land of the free; 
Oh, let me go, darling, I'll soon send for thee,

And all the day, thro' heat and cold, I

At home I

wife and three big boys, 
They nearly drive me crazy, wid there fightin' and their noise; 
There's Roger and fat Mickey and big Dan, that makes the three. 
But of all the gang fat Mickey sure be looks the most like me. 
CHORUS. 
Now there's Dan, handsome Dan, sure he's the ladies' man: 
And Roger, he's the diyil wid his dancin' and his noise. 
But of all the boys we've none, so fond of jolly fun 
As Mickey, darlin' Mickey, he's the best of all the boys. 
He's as broad as he is lengthy. and he waighs two hundred 
pounds; 
At atein' or at slapein sure his like cannot be found. 
At snorein' he's the. divil; now believe me when I 
say, 
You can hear him snore from Tubby hook, across the Dublin hay. 
And he can ate his size in mate, or pack the grub below; 
At drinking Irish whiskey sure. egad, he is not slow. 
When he comes home at four o'clock. clock ful' oi old benzine

1 AWFUL ON THE SLY. 
Originally sung by VIRGINIA STIcKNET. 
Wno does not like the ear to treat, 
And listen any time, 
To music soul-enchanting strain, 
What is there more divine. 
This is a 
fast and growing age, 
Our people can't wait long, 
But yet they always will find time, 
To listen to a 
song; 
And when you to the opera go, 
The pretty girls to spy, 
And from behind a 
nobby fan, 
You catch a 
roguish eye, 
The artists too are very fine, 
To please you they will try, 
But when you look behind the scenes, 
They're awful on the sly. 
Yes, boys, this is a 
funny world, 
Some laugh while others cry, 
And though they preach and pray, my boys, 
They're awful on the sly. 
Our city belles in summer time, 
Must have the country air, 
And should you chance to Long Branch go, 
Tnifrc sure to find them there 
In gaudy silks and diamonds bright, 
Like queens they pass you by, 
If you're a 
nobby handsome boy, 
They'll know you on the sly. 
You say you will not have these girls. 
But to the country go, 
And love a 
modest farmer's girl, 
Whose cheeks with blushes glow. 
And as she hangs her bashful head 
To hide her roguish eye, 
You're oftimes sold, for you don't know, 
What she knows on the sly. 
Yes, boys, & e. 
When to the courts of Justice go, 
Where Judge and jury bold, 
There sit and listen to the words, 
Which there to them are told, 
With solemn oath ti justice give. 
And punish wrong they try, 
And yet for money sell themselves, 
And do it on the sly. 
Yet do not think this world all had, 
And through life weeping go, 
But laugh with those who love to laugh, 
And thus life's beauties know. 
And if you think I 
am the one, 
Who will true fun deny, 
Why all I 
have to say to you, 
Is try me on the sly. 
Yee, boys, Ira

Some drags were obtained, two boats were rnann'd 
To search for my lost Arabella, 
From the bottom they dragged, grasp'd in her hand 
Was the ill-fated blue silk umbrella; 
In blankets they rolled her, gave brandy hot, 
'Till her face was as red as a

When rolling her over, to her senses elle got, 
She said 'tis delightful, 0, very. 
Home we returned, of the accident spoke. 
That it was'nt no worse, were delighted, 
Then laughed as they thought a

To strengthen it we were united.

With faces so rosy and merry.

There's none I've set my heart on, 
That's half so charming and so sweet, 
As the jolly Dolly Varden; 
We wear them on the promenade, 
At home and in the garden, 
In fact the sweetest thing to me, 
Was the jolly Dolly Varden.

In the sweet Dolly Varden dress. 
Oh, my, ain't it awful nice, 
Say, boys, ain't it awful nice, 
You cannot help but love me when 
I 
wear my Dolly Varden. 
The gents all look as I 
pass by, 
Of me they each make mention, 
They flatter me, I 
don't deny, 
By paying such attention, 
Although sweet to my vanity, 
My heart it serves to harden, 
For it is not me they're attracted by, 
But by my Dolly Varden. 
Oh, my, ,ke, 
One day last week I 
took a

My hair dressed a

My nobby hat was all the talk, 
My boots they were all sweet on;

At every verse I've lost my dear.

Her eyes are large and very bright, 
Her mouth is small with teeth so white 
She ran away, cte 
she's curly hair, as dark as night; 
Her skin as fair as lilies white; 
Her cheeks are like the blushing rose, 
A

she's rather stout and full of prffle, 
And when she walks she takes a

She swings her arms with such a

No Venus e'er had such a

She ran away, ate. 
I

Because I

Where little pigs and ducklings quack;

Through loving one that ne'er loved me, 
Became defunct for love of she.

saz W OULD, YOtT KNOW ; SHE WAS JUST 
ABOUT THE AGE. 
Ohl once I 
dearly loved a 
girl, her name was Sarah Greent, 
No rarer girl, no fairer girl; than Sarah shall be seen. 
Seventeen years old, need you be told, for a 
sweetheart she'd 
a 
rage, 
But then, of course, she would, you know, she's just about 
the age. 
But then, of conrset.she would, you know, 
She would; you know she would, 
But then, of course, she would, you know% 
She's just about the age. 
• 
She lived a 
little way from town, it NN asn't very far, 
And with her lived a 
cross old chap, altho' he was her Pa. 
One day when her papa. was out, I 
went to her's to dine, 
And in my pocket, for a 
treat, I 
took a 
glass of wine. 
For she liked wine, she would, you know, etc. 
We sat and talked a 
little while, and after we had dined7 
I 
for a 
little drop of wine felt mightily inclined; 
When her father he knocked at the door, and she to me did 
rush, 
And pushed me in Ao cupboard, and oh! I 
saw her blush! 
But then, of course, she would, etc. 
Her father sat and talked to her for half an hour or more, 
And she sat leaning all the while against the cupboard door, 
When the wine flask in my pocket broke and made a 
pre-
cious mess, 
Ran under the cupboard door and round her new silk 
dress. 
For she wore silk, she would, etc. 
Her father saw the flowing *ine, and said, " Sarah, what is 
that ?" 
She said," Somejam and pickle jars are broken by the cat." 
He opened then the cupboard door, saying much like damn, 
And I 
was in a 
pickle, as well as in a 
jam. 
And the ohl man swore, he. would, etc. 
He pulled me out and punched my head, then with good 
humor he" 
On hearing I 
was not bad off, invited me to tea. 
Since then I've married Sarah Green, and yearly to my joy, 
Itty Sarah will present me with a 
little girl or boy.

But then, of course, she would, etc. 
WHAT A STUNNING PAIR OF LEGS. 
I'm a 
buxum little fellow, now it's true, I 
do declare, 
But still I'm not a 
dandy with a 
nobby head of hair ; 
As I roam along the streets they admire me—oh fegs ! 
And the ladies cry when passing, " What a 
stunning pair of legs ! " 
Tot d rol, etc. 
The very morning I 
was born, I 
drained my mother's purse, 
There was the cook and doctor, the midwife and the nurse, 
They drank my health in gin and rum, and ogled me--oh, fogs! 
And each, in turn, kept shouting, " What a 
stunning pair of legs !" 
Tol de rol, etc. 
Now when that I 
grew up a 
boy, and I 
was sent to school, 
One day I 
played the truant, and fell into a 
pool, 
My master went to flog me—he hollooed out, oh, fag,s! 
"Hold fast the little rascal by his stunning patr of legs!" 
Tol de rol, etc. 
My mother doted on ine, and often she would sing, 
Indeed, I 
think my little sort will surely be a 
king." 
One day I 
tried to stop a 
pig, it was a 
lark, oh, fegs! 
For he gave a 
grunt and bolted through my legs. 
Tol de rol, etc. 
A 
policeman collared hold of me—oh ! how he made me squeak--
lie took me to the station-house, and then before the beak ; 
"Do you know him ? " said the magistrate; said the peeler, " Yes 
oh, fegs! 
You may know he is a 
prig by his stunning pair of legs." 
Tot de rol, etc. 
"Send him off to Sing Sing," the magistrate then says, 
" 
And let him dance the treadmill for one-and-thirty days; 
Tell the governor to watch him, and work him well, 
And clasp a 
pair of ruffles on his stunning pair of legs." 
Tol de rol, etc. 
I 
served a 
month in limbo, in misery and pain, 
I 
hope that I 
shall never get into their claws again ; 
I 
tried to run one morning, but trod upon some eggs, 
And slipped into a 
plug-hole with my stunning pair of legs.

YOU may talk about your dashing blondes, 
And lovely brunettes gay; 
But there's none so fair that can compare 
With my Belle of Pleasure Bay. 
She's only seventeen years old, and has such modest grace, 
'T would do you good, indeed it would, to see her smiling face, 
And hear her little prattling tongue, 
Would steal your heart away. 
E'er feet are small, and she's not tall, 
My Belle of Pleasure Bay. 
CHORUS. 
We first met, ' twas in summer, ( BREAK.) 
And for life I 
think I've won her. 
(BREAK.) 
You may talk about your dashing blondes,: 
And lovely brunettes gay; 
But there's none so fair that can compare, 
With my Belle of Pleasure Bay. 
Of course I've rivals by the score, 
Who think that her they'll win; 
They praise her hair but she don't care, 
She's not to be taken in. 
She treats them all with kind respect but says she must refu-se, 
For gold nor land can win her hand, from the lover he dict. 
choose. 
So soon we'll married be, and then 
nI bring her here some day. 
knd then with me, you will agree 
She's the Belle of Pleasure Bay. 
We first, Jce.

HOW ASHAMED I 
WAS. 
As 
sung by Miss JENNIE ENGEL. 
LADIES ' 
VERSION. 
WHEN first a 
courting I 
began, I 
was so shy, pray unilcii 
stand, 
And how I 
was served by my young man, forget that 
night I 
never can; 
It was at a 
party, you must know, and underneath the 
mistletoe, 
Said he, I 
love you, cousin Chris; and then he stole from 
me a 
kiss. 
CHoRUS. 
He kiss'd me once, how 'shamed I 
was, 
He kiss'd me twice, hey, how 'shamed I 
was; 
He kiss'd me thrice, and said it was nice, 
La! no one knows how 'shamed I 
was. 
First we danced and then we sang, our voices aim the 
whole house rang, 
And all enjoyed themselves but I 
really felt so dreadful 
shy; 
Soon I 
found I 
was in love, for cousin Fred call'd me a 
dove, 
He pressed my hand and then said this, I 
intend to have 
another kiss. 
Then he kiss'd me once. & c.. 
When he kiss'd me the second time. I 
heard Biz Ben 
mence to chime, 
The clock struck twelve and then you know I 
thought it 
was quite time to go; 
So wished good night to every one, who hoped I 
had en-
joyed the fun, 
So Freddy thought it 5twouldn't be amiss just to steal 
another kiss. 
Then he kiss'd me once, S:c. 
He saw me home, its really true, and we chatted on as 
lovers do, 
I 
don't remember all he said. I 
know he asked if I 
would 
wed; 
I 
felt I 
blushed, turned very red, and said. I'll marry y<X1 
dear Fred, 
Said he I 
feel so happy, Miss, that we'll seal the bargain 
with a 
kiss. 
COM-
THAT DEAR LITTLE CHARMER OF MINE, 
I 
FEEL just as gay as the sweet birds in May, 
When they're hopping from twig unto twig, 
And my heart feels so light and all things look so bright, 
That for troubles I 
don't care a 
fig. 
The cause of my gladness to you I 
will tell, 
I've fallen in love with a 
fairy named Nell, 
.She's a 
sweet little beauty, a 
regular belle, 
Is that dear little charmer of mine. 
CHORUS. 
You may talk of your girls with their sweet auburn curls, 
With their faces so fair and divine; 
But I 
vow and declare, there's no girl can compare 
With that dear little charmer of mine. 
In form she is neat, she has two pretty feet. 
She wears number twos, I 
should say, 
And her sweet laughing eyes, just as blue as the skies,. 
Are the things to drive dull care away; 
She can dance like a 
fairy and sing like a 
bird. 
Her voice is the sweetest I 
ever have heard, 
she's the " pink of perfection," don't think rue absurk 
For I 
love that dear charmer of mine. 
You may talk. & c.. 
'Twits but yesterday—a.s through sunny Broadway 
We were both promenading so fine. 
That the dear little dove did accept of my love, 
krid consented at once to be mine. 
And when we are married I'll cut a 
great swell.. 
At the balls and the parties with dear little Nell; 
For I'm sure that at all she'll be crowned as the belle, 
Will that dear little charmer of mine,. 
Ion may talk, & e.

And I 
never was told so before! 
I 
wish you would skp in and see 
My pet, in the dollar store! 
Next Sunday is the happy day, 
She says we're to be wed. 
I 
feel so awful jolly, boys, 
I'm really out of my head; 
For when you love a 
pretty girl, 
You'll ask for nothing more; 
So hurry up! get on the mash, 
There's plenty in the store. 
For she said, &c.

: 
THE BASHFUL YOUNG LADY. 
Music published in B. W. Hitchcock's Half Dime series. 
Oh I 
good gracious ! I 
hope I'm not going to faint 
Oh ! this bashfulness is such a 
dreadful complaint 
I 
am so confused, and my cheeks are so hot 
Oh! don't look, or indeed, I 
shall die on the spot! 
It is so distressing—nobody, I in sure, 
Would belive what it is that I 
have to endure : 
What I 
suffer' d 
at dancing, and lessons at school, 
Where I 
had to stand out by 4-self on a 
stool 
Where I 
had to stand out by myself on a 
stool. 
II I 
venture to sing it's so dreadful to know 
That I 
look like a 
peony out in full blow; 
And it is so provoking wherever one goes, 
To be called by the gentlemen "couleur de rose" 
If asked to take wine, there's that saucy boy, Ned, 
With his " Cousin, ahem ! can I 
help you to red ?' 
And if ever I'm ill, there's that wretch,Doctor Scott, 
.\\`itli his "Really, can't say—Scarlatina, or not." 
If I 
should have an offer I—Oh! what have I 
said ?— 
If there is one thing on earth it is that that I 
dread— 
Yet, would you beleive it, that horrid Mamma, 
Says, " That is carrying bashfulness rather too far." 
I 
only do hope, if it should be the case, 
That the gentleman won't look me quite in the face; 
For, indeed, if his suit be too warmly should press, 
ll.I'm extremely afraid I 
might blush, and say—"Yes." 
COME SIT BY MY 
SIDE, LITTLE DARIANC: 
As sung by Charlie Melville. 
Come sit by my side, little darling, 
And lay your brown head on my breast, 
While the angels of twilight around us, 
Are singing the flowers to rest. 
Tour hands are as fair as the lilies, 
That blossom in the shadows of green, 
And their touch has a 
magical power 
My heart from all sadness to wean. 
CILOICUS. 
Come sit by my side, little darling, 
And lay your brown head on my breatzt 
While the angels of twilight around us 
Are singing the flowers to rest. 
I 
dream, when your arms are around me, 
That life is an infinite calm, 
Your kiss has the spell of a 
charmer, 
Your kiss that is sweeter than balm, 
Oh ! what could be sweeter than dreamirkr! 
This dream that is on us to-ni[dit ? 
Let us think of the present, my darling, 
The future is out of our sight. 
Come sit by my side, & c. 
Sing low in the twilight some ballad, 
As sweet as the smile on your face, 
That shall thrill me with melo;I:,-
And touch with its words' tender grace. 
And I'll give you a 
kiss when it's ended, 
A kiss that the singer shall earn, 
And perhaps, do you hear, little darling? 
I 
shall ask for a 
kiss in return. 
Come sit by my side, Le.

Music by WA.NNEMACHRI
o. 
And sung by ADA WRAY. 
A NICE young man came a 
courting me, 
Singing, Oh! my dear, and I 
love you dearly, 
He was the nicest young man that you ever did see, 
Singing, Oh! and I 
love you dearly. 
He was so tall, and he was so smart, 
When he asked me to marry him it made me start, 
And the words that he spoke went clean through my heart, 
Singing, Oh ! then he loved me dearly. 
I 
must manage now to borrow a 
five or ten, 
Singing, Oh! my dear, I 
love you dearly, 
And says he, my dear, we'll be married then, 
For Oh! I 
love you dearly. 
'Tis to pay for the license and the ring to buy, 
And he rolled up his eyes and heaved a 
sigh, 
And the expression of his face nearly made me cry, 
With his Oh! and I 
love you dearly,. 
A 
ten dollar bill then I 
gave unto he, 
With his Oh! my dear, and I 
love you dearly; 
But my fellow and my money never more did I 
see, 
With his Oh! my dear, and I 
love you dearly; 
For in spite of all the things he said, 
When he got my money away he sped, 
And to red-headed Sal he married, 
Oh! how could he have loved me dearly ?.

The love- tale, provided it's told—

Oh I

Ah ah I

Ah : ah 
you must really ask mamma. 
They sigh for existence with me 
In a

Proposing the town to flee, 
An never come back any more! 
" 
Oh I

Oh! pledge there our mutual loves, 
And,. oh

Like unto two turtle doves !" 
Spoken.—Turtle cloves, indeed!

Ah : ah! you must ask, & c. 
Mamma has been through it herself, 
And he knows what is best to be done, 
Believes in the use of pelf, 
And. not in a

Thus counsels my mother dear:

Don't you throw a

0, Squeeze Me, Joe. 
In Harlem Lane, there once did dwell a 
charming little beau, 
With whom I 
walked and sometimes talked, his christian name 
was Joe; 
I 
knew that he was fond of me, though he never told me so, 
But when my hand in his was pressed, I 
said 0 
squeeze me Joe. 
CHORUS. 
0, Squeeze me, Joe, 0, Squeeze me, Joe, 
It makes me feel so jolly you know; 
0, squeeze me, Joe, 0, squeeze me, Joe, 
And if you love me tell me so. 
He kept a 
pretty little farm, and horses he had three, 
So he said, my dear, there'll be no harm to take a 
ride with me, 
He did and slipp' d from off the horse, and caught me you must 
[know; 
Then placed his arm around my waist, when I 
cried, don't

He popp'd the question there and then, he did upon my life,

And said my little darling, will you really be my wife ; 
I

I'll be your wife and joy through life, if you'll only squeeze me

Did You Mean What You Said? 
The Music can be obtained at the Music Store of Horace 
Waters, 481 Broadway, New York. 
Composed by JOHN S. 
Cox. 
DID you mean what you said when you told me 
You'd love me thro' good and thro' ill, 
A.nd long as your lifetime you'd hold me 
The centre of happiness still ? 
Did you not speak as men speak too often, 
With words of no meaning at all, 
save only with falsehood to soften 
The bosom they mean to enthrall ? 
CHORUS. 
Did you mean what you said when you told me 
You'd love me thro' good and thro' ill, 
And long as your lifetime you'd hold me 
The centre of happiness still ? 
My heart like a 
timid bird flutters 
Around the fond tone of your voice, 
And mute tho' the language it utters, 
It beats but to hear and rejoice 
Nay, let not my words give you pain, love, 
For doubts like night shadows all fly, 
And all seemeth sunshine again, love, 
Beneath the dear glance of ,your eye.

A Starry Night for a 
Ramble, 
I 
LIKE a 
game at Croquet 
Or bowling on the green, 
I 
like a 
little boating 
To pull against the stream, 
But of all the games that I 
love. best 
To fill me with delight, 
I 
like to take a 
ramble 
Upon a 
starry night. 
CHORUS. 
A 
starry night for a 
ramble, 
In a 
flow'ry dell, 
Through the bush and bramble. 
Kiss and never tell. 
Talk about your bathing 
Or strolling on the sands 
Or some unseen verandah 
Where gentle zephyr fans, 
Or rolling home in the morning, boys, 
And very nearly tight, 
Could never beat a 
ramble 
Upon a 
starry night: 
A 
starry night for a 
ramble, eta. 
I 
like to take my sweetheart 
"Of course you would" said he, 
And softly whisper in her ear 
"flow dearly I 
love you," 
And when you picture to yourselves 
The scenes of such delight, 
You'll want to take a 
ramble 
Upon a 
starry night. 
A 
starry night for a 
ramble, SLe. 
Some will choose a 
velocipede 
And others take a 
drive, 
And some will sit and mope at home 
Half dead and half alive. 
And some will choose a 
steamboat, 
And others even fight, 
But I'll enjoy my ramble 
Upon a 
starry night. 
Ain't it Nice to Have a 
Beau? 
BY ARTHUR W . 
FRENCH. 
AS you out a 
walking go, 
When the crowds are in the street, 
Passing by you to and fro, 
Oft by chance SOME ONE you meet; 
Soon he's walking by your side, 
With his arm in yours—just so— 
Looking down on you with pride— 
Ain't it nice to have a 
beau ? 
Cnottus. 
Ain't it nice to have a 
beau, 
One Nilo loves you well, you know, 
As you out a 
walking go— 
Ain't it nice to have a 
beau ? 
Arm in arm you stray along, 
Envied by each single lass, 
Who from out the passage throng, 
Jealous glances- on you cast. 
And the swells that try to flirt 
Find that they have got no show, 
Deeming you so proud and pert— 
Ain't it nice to have a 
beau ? 
By and by you reach the door, 
While, of course, just there and then 
Words of love HE whispers o'er, 
Saying he will come again. 
Loving lips to yours are pressed, 
And you murmur softly—oh! 
Don't you wish you knew the rest ? 
Ain't it nice to have a 
beau ?

The Bashful Girl. 
LITTLE COQUETTE. 
As sung by Miss Jennie Hughes. 
I'm a 
stupid bashful girl, 
How I 
titty-ti-ti-tremble, 
Seeing just to hear me sing, 
Such a 
multitude assemble, 
Oh, pray don' t, or I 
won't, 
Sing a 
note if anybody look at me, 
How I 
quake, how I 
shake, 
Verily timidity's a 
dreadful thing 
Gentlemen I 
chance to meet, 
Make me niny-ni-ni- nervous, 
And I 
never walk the street, 
Without saying heaven preserve us 
How they stare, I 
declare 
I 
get red as any peony, 
Look so meek that they speak, 
Oh, George ! isn't she a 
very, very Bashful Girl. 
Won't some gentleman be my friend, 
Like a 
bibby-bi-hi-bi-brother, 
Telling me my fault's to mend, 
And this silly shyness smother, 
If I 
can find a 
man, 
Who belives in love that is platonical, 
I 
might get courage yet, 
Really I'm a 
very, very, baskful Girl. 
Oh! how I 
love to flirt, 
Yes, to flirt; yes, to flirt; 
To coax in manner pert, 
And bring men on their knees; 
With love they say they•11 die, 
And they sigh, and they cry; 
But this is my reply, 
And this is how

It's Naughty But It's Nice. 
As sung by Miss Jennie Hughes. 
There's lots of things you know, 
Wherever you may go, 
That we should never undertake to do, 
Although it charms the eye, 
We ought to pass it by, 
It would be better if we only knew. 
My Mother used to say, unto me every day, 
When you see a 
pie don't always want a 
slice, 
I 
used to go up stairs and take it unawares, 
All the while I 
knew ' twas naughty but ' twas nice. 
CHORUS. 
Oh ! it's naughty but it's nice, and we like it so, 
'Tis sure fellows do wrong to entice, 
No matter what you see, you never can agree, 
All the while you know its naughty but it's nice, you bet! 
We go to see our girls, with lots of pretty curls, 
To pass the time so pleasantly away, 
We praise the little dears, and drive away their fears, 
And such lots of sweet nonsence to them say. 
And when it's late at night, 
The stars are shining bright, 
To kiss them, why it gives to life a 
spice, 
Our arms around their wais ts, delightfully are placed 
All the while we know it's naughty but it's nice. 
PRETTY LITTLE MILLINER, 
SONG AND DANCE. 
UP Bleecker street the other day, 
By ,chance I 
did perceive, 
The prettiest face I 
ever saw, 
My eyes I 
scarced believe. 
She was smiling at the window, 
And I 
stopped just by the door, 
For I 
felt I 
loved her at first sight, 
The girl in the millinery store. 
CHORUS. 
She's the dearest one to me, 
Her smiling face you ought to see; 
She's the sweetest little milliner, 
And the idol of my heart, 
Some happy day I'll make her mine. 
So we never more can part. 
I 
entered then into the store. 
To win her I 
would try, 
1 
told her that I'd called to see, 
Some neck-ties that I'd buy; 
She picked me out a 
pretty one. 
I 
thanked her o'er and o'er, 
l 
promised her I'd call again, 
When I 
passed the millinery store. 
She's the dearest, .tc. 
At a 
masquerade we met next, 
I 
sat down by her side, 
In the mazy dance I 
asked her, 
Some day to be my bride; 
Of course, as I 
expected, 
As many have done before, 
She answered, " yes," so sweetly, 
And we keep a 
millinery store. 
She's the dearest, /cc.

Tommy Make Room For Your Auntie 
Originally sung, with great success, by Miss 
RICHMOND, at the Olympic Theatre. 
Now, Mrs. Fitzwilliam, of Union Square, 
Presents herself to you ; 
And when she is dressed, why you may guess, 
Of gents she knows a 
few. 
A 
widower fell in love with me, 
While riding on a 
train; 
He had his little boy with him, 
Which caused us both great pain. 
SPOKEN. — The father introduced me to his little bo:7- 
A 
laiS Auntie, and during the whole journey he was obiip.-.ri 
k say— 
CHORUS, 
Tommy, make room for your Auntie, 
There's a 
little dear ; 
Tommy make room for your Auntie, 
I 
want her to sit here, 
Ion know Papa has got a 
cake, 
That he will give to you; 
SO 
pray don't annoy then, be a 
good boy, 
Make room for your Auntie, do. 
When first I 
met this widower, 
'Twas on my journey down; 
To spend a 
day at Long Branch— 
Just like a 
swell from town ; 
The widower loved romantic scenes, 
And I 
squeeze on the sly; 
So when his arm went round my waist, 
The boy began to cry. 
SPoKEN.—Yes, the more the boy cried, the more the 
lather said— 
Tommy, make room, &a. 
The father told his loving son 
To watch the passing train ; 
But no, he said, Papa you'll kiss 
That lady again. 
Of course I 
blushed a 
maiden blush, 
And he was not himself; 
For who could make love on a 
seat 
In front of that young elf. 
SPoREN.—The thing was impossible—in rain the father 
said— 
Tommy, me

Beecher is the veatest man 
That evc.r preached to text ; 
It mrrit be so, the Ladies all go, 
To hour what's coming next; 
He commences very mild, 
Then he rips, swears and dams ! 
And has the cheek to tell us that, 
He's been tender on the Iambs! 
CHonus. 
Go hear Beecher, boys, 
Go hear Beecher, boys, 
Go hear Beecher, for, 
He's tender on the lambs! 
One certain Lady T. 
Who interested, went 
To hear this wonderful Beecher 
In his great argument ; 
She soon was satisfied 
She joined both heart and hand— 
Said Beecher's food was -very good 
To feed the tender lambs ! 
Go hear Beecher, d:c. 
Now, Beecher tried his nerve 
To preach of the promLs'd land, 
But the sight of so much woman, 
He got cranky on the lamb! 
You'll find him now at home, 
Singing his new made Psalms; 
The ending of his verses are, 
I'm still tender on the lambs! 
Go hear Beecher, &v.

monds and spades—and each or these into K for King. Q for Queen, 
and K for Knave, and nuntla?rs 1, 3, to 10.

four rows, and are to be read according to directions.

swers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under-
standing.

CO1111111;4 Cards,—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want fiequently felt by young people—a want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a way as to be non-committaL 
Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too diffi. 
dent or too tearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unlady-like encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many 
lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in tha 
happiness of matrimony. This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes further explanation un-
necessary. 
The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties

The N. Y. Evening a/ail writes? 
"A 
Little Book has lately appeared in print at Mr. A. J. 
FISHER'S, 93 Nas-
sau street ca led the 
Little Flirt." 
We cannot say that we recommend 
it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, as we think it would only 
encourage the bad habit of " flirting." 
Unfortunately, there is enough 
of it done without any further necessity of explaining " how, when and 
where to do it." and this little volume would advise and initiate the un-
corrupted in practicing what is commonly called "flirting." 
The N. 3. Eeening Telegram writes: " We have lately seen a neat little 
book, bound in Morocco leather, costing twenty-five cents, called the 
"Little Flirt," published by A. 
J. 
FISHER, No. 98 Nassau street. 
It 
gives information of the modus opt randi of flirting, and of the meaning 
of every motion of the handkerchief, fan, glove and parasol. 
As there 
is nothing at all objectionable in the volume, and :its contents might af-
ford some innocent amusement to many, we do nct hesitate to recom-
mend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers."
