when I got on the freeway by the college, my intention was to t

 The neat
 
thing I was aware of was that I was in the middle of Sepulveda pass
 
so I shook myself and decided to take the S

the Harbor and on from there.
 The next thing I knew, I was gettin:
 
into line to get off t at the air port exit.  At that point, I discovered
 
I couldn't get back on the Long Beach freeway going the other way
 
so I decided to cross town on the surface.
 I dug out the map, trnccd
 
out a perfectly logical way to get to the school, and discovered I
 
couldn't figure out which way to turn because the map was unside down
 
to the way I was heading.
 It really shook me up.
 
Anyway, it all ended happily; I went the wron;
, way twice
 
more, but by absolutely forcing myself to think, I managed to get to
 
the school, talked for an hour to the principal (
I think coherently)
 
watched the children, told Bob Eberlein where to go and managed to  et

 I

tntxk run out of ideas, Alan could probably put in a good word for
 
you at Columbia.
 I have no idea whether they are playing with priar

or not, probably not.
 Joan and Count called me from the Washington
 
meetings last night, both feeling no pain.
 I asked Joan where they
 
were working on primate behavior that would be fun for you to thirh
 
of for the future and she said Japan -
-
 that's where they trained
 
them to wash their food or something?  I had forgotten about thaL.
 
I wouldn't be too discouraged about grad school; I think you ar
 
absolutely superb, and obviously I am a good judge since I have row
 
attained tenure -
-
 got a letter from old President Prator about it
 
just yesterday.
 It's taken so long I don;t even feel particularly
 
any way about it.  Anyhow, with Washburn and Dundes and whatsheT-a
 
backing you as strongly as they have, it does seem tn  ac  .

Dear Naomi,
 
You are positively the only decent correspondent in the
 
whole family.
 I haven't heard from Corey since I wrote her last -
-
a shameful two weeks ago.
 Well, I
'm enjoying my own sloth -
-
 actually
 
not so much sloth as tending to my own business for a change.
 I de-
cided two weeks ago that I would use every scrap of time I could wangle
 
to work on The Book and that's what I
've been doing.  Nothing else
 
the house is gradually decaying under layer upon layer of junk; an
 
archaeologist should be able to make some significant discovered here
 
within another month.
 
two
 
Anyhow, I
've made some progress -
-
 about half to s/third
 
done, I think, and with the advent of the new semester, I
'm trying
 
to get on a new routine.
 Weekdays, I will now E
Ex tx
iix
x
 
d:
kxx±
1A:knnxmyx xtfx:tv  devote to the three weeks' accumulation of
 
unanswered letters, bills and debris; weekends, I
'll get back on
 
to my literary endeavors.  I finally got up enough nerve to show
 
what I had so far to Count and Joan and they both liked it,  so I
'm
 
greatly encouraged. Count, in fact, flattered me enormously by
 
suggesting I try to get Margaret Mead to write an introduction!
 
How's that for a compliment?  Do you think I should title it Growing
 
Up in Georgia or Coming Of Age on St Simons? -
-
I just started off a new semester this morning and
 after
 
i
r talking fox steadily for three hours feel a little slap-happy.
 
I have enormous classes -
-
 the result of the rumor getting about that
 
I won't be around much anymore,  I suspect.  My case has reached the
 
dizzying heights of Pres. Prator's office; so far, all faculty commit-
tees have supported me.
 The word is that he will delay his decision
 
as long as possible in the hopes I will go off and find another job,
 
and stop bothering him.
 Since I have no other job to find, at the
 
moment,  I don't think I
'll cooperate.
 If push comes to shove,  I ought
 
to be able to patch together enough guitar classes to get by on.
 
Other news is pretty nil.
 Nick has the flu, running a temper-
ature and feeling miserable but not really sick.
 Dad has been in kind
 
of a coma since Christmas but I hope is beginning to pull out of it.
 
:
1y being so preoccupied with the book hasn't helped, and I
'm hoping
 
to be able to devote a little time to just organizing things around
 
the place; if he can just get moving on any kind of project, home
 
fixing or something, I think he'll begin functionning again.  Pizza
 
and Higgins disgraced themselves by chewing the pads off my beautiful
 
earphones and dragging them out in the backyard.
 We are not quite
 
speaking yet -
-
 I think they're sorry.
 Higgins  so j far as I can
 
judge is not pregnant -
-
 if she is,  she's as nutty as ever.
 Pizza
 
does look a bit thick in the midd midsection,  but we will hope it's
 
just middle-aged spread.
 
I wrote Corey my latest idea  which I suspect sounds pretty
 
wild -
-
 e
.g. to have the wedding in the backyard which would kill two
 
birds with one stone: eliminate some unnecessary expense and force us
 
to clean all that blasted lumber and junk out.
 I assume she is not
 
enthusiastic about the idea and Margo Slocum came up with another
 
probably better one -
-
 she says that the Friends Meeting House is avail-
able for weddings.  Although it's not as homey a
F
, it might be,  it i
s
 
relatively informal and very pretty with that nice patio and all.
 
Also, no crosses or other of the more depressing signs of religion.
 
I told Joan about Corey's decision not to get married because of
 
people looking at her and she immediately pointed out that all Corey
 
needs to do is decide on a traditional Swazi ceremony in which the
 
bridg sits under a tent all day.
 She also mentioned another part of
 
the world in which the i
aridg bride makes no appearance at all, being
 
considered far too delicate for the ordeal and her father does it all
 
for her.
 Siso another place where the * matron to be sits in a small
 
hut for three years ahead of the ceremony getting fattened up -
-
 when
 
she emerges I should imagine no one would want to look at her.  Any-
how, tell Corey with her anthropological background, she should be
 
able to locate some tradition that would a be suitable, with these as
 
a starter.  Also tell her I
'll write her by the end of the week.
 
I
'm just too pooped out tonight.
 
Did you got get all those tests about your abilities and
 
all?  I am anxious to know how talented you r
*± x r  are -
-
 not that
 
I don't already have an inkling.
 Don't worry so much about money,
 
honey; we will be able to muddle through in some fashion or another
 
and if these things cost or something,  let me know and we'll manage
 
it from here.
 
It looks as though I might be up in San Francisco around
 
April 15th or thereabouts for this Ortho-Psychiatric bash.
 I don't
 
know if this is before or after Easter vacation.
 In any event, may
 
I have the pleasure of your and John's company for a night on the
 
town?

a

 he is one of the local HD's who refused to cooperate with t
i. ,
 
american Committee etc.  so I think he feels that the
 dr
 
name and concluded he had fud ed the data.
 So it
 
L
nyway, though it is not aecessary to panic out abou
 
afinitely that you and Corey should be tested; appar
 
does n ot  always show up in routine urinalyses and when there is
 
Hmily history of diabetes a doctor will order an additional blood
 
L
ast given.
 He suggests that you call your local medical man -
-
 
op in at the health center -
-
 and tell them that diabetes has be
 
t
scovered in your family and  L
et the test made at your reasonabiL
 
-ny convenience and that you include it in future medical histo
 
that checks can be made reasonably frequently.
 Apparently you
 
n develop the adult kind at any point in your l
ife, so though yc
 
ikely enough don't have it, it should be looked out for in futurc.
 
far as I can gather, one of the problems with diabetes is that
 
a
sults in various exotic symptoms varying from simple  a
t
 fatiga
 
migraine-type headaches to neurological problems, to slow-h
.eali
 
aunds etc. etc.  so the :
1D's are interested always in knowing ther

I am delighted that you like your philosophy course. Kindly
 
loomy predictions.  Actually,  the part I liked best of my
 
:apid survey course was early philosophy (
I always have enjoyed ancient
 
history) and semantics, and when you come down to it, it really is the
 
teacher that makes such subjects for you.
 I will think about collecting
 
rojects for you; the only thing that occurs to me offhand is that you
 
'
ight go back to the school where you were singing with the kids and collect
 
rom the children you knew there.

e have a Great Man doing the teaching -
-
 a twinkly little ol'
 
'
uy who was president of the University of Hawaii until he retired a f
c
 
years ago, and who invented something called Snyder's formula concerno"
 
with nopulation genetics.
 It is one of those sinister things that c

be tynewritten; I
'll b nut it in at the end of the letter in case yo
 
aicht recor

 infinitely pat

little taken aback by the fact that none of us knows fact one about c.
 
istry or anything else that he assumes is eu =amxk =wted -
-
 to use h
i
 
term -
-
 common household knowledge.
 I
'm afraid he hasn't been in
 
common household for quite a long time.
 However, the really disarmir
 
thing about him is that he quite clearly thinks that the beauty oF bio-
chemistry is its simplicity and logic,  and I must say wh"a wn'ra
 c1.
 
It's afterwards that I get balled Un.
 
e tells me, by the way,  that the University of i

tey are only offering a two year course to be finished on the mainlen ,
 
it  it will be expanding very soon.
 They open next fall, and he urged  I
'C
 
to write and tell you about it for the year after.
 It is obviously his

"
by (though he maintains he now has no connection with the university)
 
T1d  he is most proud of its faculty, curriculum and facilities.
 He is

of Colorado that has hit many of the back-home naners (
different memkxx
 
students at the institute have been getting phone calls from their near c:

dxtx but my own reaction
 
is beginning to be ftnxd lead me to it.
 One kind of sad thing hannened ct
 
the dance; I hadn't been there five minutes and had just wormed my way u'

over who must have been one of the organizers and asked me all about whethn -
it was mxktxgxtavxxxehxx too noisy and if peonle around were complaining.

 I had just as much right to a night out as anybody else.

March 21, 1965
 
Dearest Naomi,
 
I seem only to write you on evenings when I
'm very
 
rushed and this is no exception; I suppose the basic problem is that
 
I
'm rushed most of the time.
 First of all, I have some business.
 
One.  According to you, I sent you an extra check last
 
month?  Do my ears deceive me?  What have you done with same?  Assuming
 
that you didn't do anything (as txwN * xkaxux
 your mother's daughter)
 
just hang on to it, and put in in the bank next week or so to take care
 
of April.  However, let me km know what and when you do, so T can keep
 
my records straight here.  Also, I will not then send you a check next
 
ADril 1st -
-
 right? Please confirm.
 
Two.  The camp I wrote about is El Rancho x Navarro;
 
the owner may be
 -aka  written to as Mr.  Iry Newman, El Rancho
 
avarro, Philo, California.
 I have looked Philo up on the map and
 
it's near the coast a ways north of San Francisco; it should be i
n
 
his
, tree country.
 Either you or Corey or both should write him an
 
ask him to send you information k about the camp and an applicatio.
 
blank for counsellors; apparently he comes down to Berkeley to intervic
 
kids for jobs from time to time, so you should mention you are Berkeley
 
students.  According to my friend, you really should be eighteen; you
 
could probable fudge successfully if you really wanted to; on the other
 
hand maybe you don't.
 Corey, of course, would be okay.  According to
 
my friend, it's a nice relaxed camp with lots of exploring and outdoorsiii
 
but minimal hullabaloo such as everybody having to do the same thing at
 
the same time; he says the counsellors have a lot of fun and a good c
1cal
 
of time to themselves and that the country i
s beautiful -
-
 lots of it,
 
he says, has never been explored or mapped.
 
Three.
 I am getting pressured on all sides to decide what
 
I am going to do this summer and parenthetically what you and Corey are
 
going to do.
 This calls for some consideration before the spring vaca-
tion I
'm afraid, though I
've been trying to stall people vigorously.
 
a
.
 Barry Olivier wx wants to know how many of us
 
are coming to the Berkeley Festival.
 I have accepted with a nice raisc.
 
The dates are June 23 through 27th.  His particular problem, of course,
 
is making hotel reservations, and I have told him we might not know for
 
a while but the sooner the better. Down here school is out June 11th,
 
but your calendar may be different, also you may not need to hang around
 
till the last day as I will.  Anyway, you can count on my driving up,
 
I expect, so that I can help you move things back down if there should be
 
a place you can leave them or if you want to stay on another week or so.
 
b.
 I have definitely made up my mind to go to Idyll-
wild this summer (dates June 28th for two weeks).  They will want to know
 
ab ut housing and so on here too.  Nick may or may not go; he should go
 
to summer school but doesn't have to.  He would like to go to Idyliwild,
 
but I am anxious if he doesn't go to summer school for him to have some-
thing else planned so he doesn't lie around and get fat all July and kici
 
August.  Any suggestions?  The Idyliwild deal is real strange this i

would you think of my suggesting Bill Vanaver again?  He's calmed do-,-i

some.
 By the way, you remember Joan whatever her name is?  It turns
 
that she has had three of those guys on her string all year -
-
 Bill
 
and Dan with the red beard and that other boy whose k name eludes me
 
and none of them apparently knew that she was steady dating the otheF
 
two except Bill who was the last cor
ner on the scene.  Anyway, he ble
 
the gaff last week and now nobody will speak to him -
-
 Joan I guess
 
cause he busted up her nice arrangement, and the other two guys beca
 
he was dating her behind their backs.
 Bill is growing a beard, perh:
 
in compensation and says there's a nice looking blond in my folklore
 
class he wants to meet, so I suppose everything will turn out all ri
 
The thing that mystifies me is what has Joan

 Nick announced the other day that h
 
needed some clothes  
 
'''i  so we charged out before he could char
 
his mom mind and got him a suit, a pair of slacks, tee shirts !

socks and black shoes plus a new pair of canvas ones.  He requested
 
some more striped shirts like the ones you picked out for Christmas
 
but I decided the bank balance had taken enough for one day.  At the
 
rocery store on the way home, he also requested money for a toothbrush
 
and special toothpaste; when T recovered, I asked how come, and he s -
the girl behind hi  in German had recommended the brand
 I said,  r
 
out of a clear blue sky?  and he said, no, it had come up St Patric
 
Tay.  Apparently Nick had remarked chattily that he hadn't anythi:
 
,reen on except his teeth, and the girl in front of him inquired
 
hi '
s teeth really were green.  Nick said no, not really, just old
 
and the young lady said why don't you try Plus White and a
 
toothbrush, so Nick did!  Do people really talk lih
 
is this has romance changed that much

onnay; I
'll see if I can hold u,)  the L

it.
 irst
 
t
:houLh, a matter of business.
 
both Dad and I were a bit unstrunn by your ;ay discussion
 
of both the current demonstrations and the eventual arrival of the
 
Un-American Activities Committee and your plans for its reception.
 
(From here on, take it as read that this is our joint opinion, so
 
that I don't have to keep saying Dad and I
, or me, as the case may
 
be.)  First, we are extremely proud of the position that you and
 
Corey are taking, and we will always be proud of you.  We are con-
cerned, though, that you not go into any potentially troublesome
 
situation in any kind of party mood, or without thinking throu h
 
the possibilities.
 
There are two considerations that we want you to bear in
 
mind (both affect you more than Corey, and this is why I
'm writing
 
you about this sordid subject -
-
 show it to Corey, too, if you will.)
 
One -
-
 concerning the possibility of your being arrested, and, as
 
you know, in this kind of situation whether or not you are arrested
 
is in good part up to you.  You are not in Mississippi, and on the
 
whole in the matter of demonstrations the cops are not really anxious
 
to fill the j
:xiix Berkeley cooler to its utmost.
 In most cases,
 
a person who i
s arrested has decided that he will take that risk
 
knowlngly.  Getting back to my one, which I seem to have lost ±
 
way back there in a sea of parenthetical remarks: if you are arrested,
 
as a juvenile, I think it would involve more than a simple bau m :
 
you out of the jug to get you (arid Roberta, by the way) released.
 
I
t is quite possible that you could not be released a except to the
 
custody of a parent, and neither Dad nor I want to see San Francisco
 
quite that much at this time of year.
 Besides which, it would probably
 
involve Dad and me, since we are legally responsible for your actions
 
until you make it to eighteen; I assure you that we are not complainingx,
 
but we think you ought to chew this one over a bit.  Two: there is
 
something horribly sticky about a jail record; it stays with you till
 
you die and again, as a prospective medical student, you are in a
 
tricky position.  You are already a girl, which is bad enough, and
 
there seems to be little to be done about that; I think you should
 
weigh whether or not you want to add another hindrance to your
 
medical school application,  (assuming you haven't changed your mind by
 
now)
 
t
his all sounds horribly serious minded, but and I don't
 
want k you to think we are sitting up nights biting our nails over
 
youxam
aixyaux this problem.  The tone of your letter was properly gay,
 
and if you are going to fight, by all means make it a gay one; we
 
just don't want you to get t
x so gay as to be silly or lacking in
 
forethought.  And as you know, to end this solemn subject, we are for
 
you in a every kind of way no matter what.
 
i
iggins is chewing my shoe at the moment; she chews any-
thin,­ available to her, including Pizza (who loves it).  Her special
 
ax favorite occuDation i
s c
xardenin., however; she dios very skill-
fully, and trots around with me smelling the flowers (wriicn she the -i
 
tastes thoughtfully if she thinks I
'm not looking).
 She and Pizza
 
play chase every evening; it is most comical to see Pizza taking the
 
role of the chasee barreling through the house hotly pursued by this
 
scrap of a puppy an eighth her size.
 I am sure we are benefittind
 
:
kiss Pie enormously by keeping the pup; she is young and sylph-like
 
of figure and her coat shines beautifully -
-
 I think it's all the
 
exercise.
 
I have bee  so slow about answerin  letters because o
f a
 
nerfectly miserable situation that's developed at the college which
 
has taken all my energy and pow; I
'll tell you about it when you
 
come home i
f txzxm you can stand to be bored by a four hour accouit
 
(
it takes fully that, especial'y with gestures).  Anyway, that's
 
mostly what I
've been doing, plus working a bit on the Georgia Sea
 
Island film, which is almost about to be finished.
 Dad is sculpin::
 
with wax, beautiful small figures; I think he is going to try castin
 
them in bronze pretty soon.  Nick departs for school and returns
 
bearing no books and with a cheerful air; I have absolutely not one
 
smitch of an idea how he is doing in school because all he talks about
 
i
s band -
-
-
 whether this is a good or bad sign, I haven't the least
 
notion.  He looks very good, however, and he does all the band things;
 
qoes to all the optional games and is thinking of trying to get into
 
a period A class next semester so that he can be in pep band or concert;
 
band; he'll take pep band if they'll let him drum; otherwise, concert.
 
He is starting to talk auf Deutsch at home much to Dad's disgust;
 
he says that one good thing about Latin (
this is Dad) is that you can't:
 
speak it, that it was bad enough to have you talking a language he
 
couldr
i '
 e understand, but to
 
kRxx-amxpxkxmNxwikkx be mumbled at in German i
s more than he f
eels is
 
ri ht and nroner.
 
he house is uusally dirty all the tue, mac1 I can't quite
 
figure out why, except that the tree is seeding itself all over the
 
lace
  and with two dogs running in and out all the time a lot of
 
junk gets carried in.
 I
'll have it more or less brushed up thouc'h
 
for Thanksgiving hopefully, or else maybe I should just let it sit
 
and greet you in its normal old way.  After all, what's home for
 
if not to give you that old familiar feeling?  I don't know about
 
you, but I am all ready for Thansgiving -

I realty don't understand about the dorm fee having to be in
 
so early; are you sure about that?  I re mem ber  di stinctly talking the
 
roblem over with Corey last yyear when she was home for vacation.
 
-
1rite me, by the way, what I should send as fee for December; it seems
 
to me that Corey's fees varied.  As for next semester,
 I guess you're
 
in a better position to work out what is best than we are; I still feel
 
that the dorm has many advantao

t

Dear Naomi,
 
'
riday ui.
1 L
 
A hasty note to tell you I talked with Kanga by phone 
concerning
  this hospital business.
 She is director of volunteers
 
for the EriCif
l0 Hospital, on  Ventura Boulevard between HavenhurSt
 
and Haskell.
 (Volunteers in this case means only teen-agers; they
 
have no adult program as yet; she said she would fudge you into
 
teen age status and I pointed out that this was possibly one of your
 
advantages in this particu'ar case -
-
 no fudging needed.)
 
Anyway, this hospital, though small, is the i central
 
valley receiving hospital for police calls etc. and she says is
 
u ite busy.
 She offers the following:  volunteer work,
 no  mone
y, 
qor four hours a week 
 minimum going on to an indefinite maximum.
 
She will waive ,
the customary six weeks training period for you and 
will simply show you round the hospital one day and explain proce-
dures before
'
you go to work; she also said she might assign another
 
girl to work with you the first couple of days if it seemed necessary.
 
She will put you in the Emergency Ward where she says there is a
 
young doctor on duty who is interested in training students and the
 
nurses are nice.
 (As a matter of fact, she says, because of the
 
smallness of the hospital, the staff is extremely nice and the rou-
tines are not so sacred as in other hospitals she has worked in.)
 
She suggests that you might find the emergency ward especially gory
 
on Fridays and Saturdays, especially during the evenings, and of
 
course, that is when they can best use help as well.  All personnel
 
including volunteers work on four hour shifts (or eight hours)
 
running from •
3 to 12, 12 to 4
, 4 to 8 and so on.
 
The advantage of this, it would seem to me, is that you
 
could get some interesting experience for- the expenditure of only
 
four or eight hours a week, on week-ends, leaving you free to take
 
another paying job, perhaps less interesting, during the week.
 One
 
disadvantage,: o
f course, would x
wx  be in the line of transporta -
tion which I suppose could be worked out by pulling xx here and haul-
ing there; another, of course, would be the messing up of week-ends.
 
However, you don't have to work Friday u Ix  t x ñ x or Saturday
 
nights; K
. just said that was the h
xtt livliest time (
speaking from
 
the x
k ui cheery medical point of view).
 
Now as for pay work, my friend proved a bust.
 She finally
 
suggested going to the UCLA Employment place and writing down jobs
 
off the board.
 They will do no referrals by correspondence, but I
 
could go there and cull off x anything that seems interesting and you
 
could write or I could call.
 I gather this is a little bit illegal
 
but not the kind of thing you actually get in trouble over.  However,
 
I hesitate to do this without you somehow; I don't really know what
 
you'd rather instead of which, i
f you follow me.  However, I will
 
try desperately to get by there xx next week and just see what the
 
general kinds of jobs are and the pay scale.
 I did run into Deedee
 
Sommers and mentioned tk*x
xtøxk u your problem to her and she said
 
she'd call her pediatriciat
h and see if he needed summer office help.
 
(
By the way, Dick
 k
x ux*ii said "Naomi and Corey haven't gotten
 
themselves mixed up in all that trouble up there at Cal, have they?"
 
and I said, "Of course", and be a looked most disapproving.
 I hope
 
I haven't broken up a fine xzt&Ii9xzk*  xxMwwzvzxTxI source of pleasant
 
A
 
I
 
t
imes for you.  However,  I
've reached this point so many times
 
before that I just handled it the way I handle my own problems
 
in this line.  Conservatives often get to like me (and I suspect
 
you and Corey as well) and then they can't quite believe that I
 
(or you) are involved in various unpopular causes, because we're
 
so nice.
 I
've decided the best way to handle it is just to be
 
perfectly cheerful and normal about it and let them :
kw do the ad-
justing.
 I
f they can't handle i
t, it's still been nice knowing
 
them.
 
I will keep on keeping my eyes and ears open; I
'm afraid
 
I haven't spent too much time on your problems because of excessive
 
quantities of my own.
 This ix has been a perfectly horrible hassle
 
of a semester and I am terribly preoccupied with my job and affairs
 
at the college.  The battle is still raging with only xtKinxtax
 
local victories on each side, but we have been in .
a p
im = perfect
 
whirlwidd of activity:  a film festival, well attended and set up
 
to honor Bobe Cannon and Archer Goodwin of the Anthropology facul-
ty film unit (
both died last summer).
 This was a feather for Ted.
 
The students produced their Anthropology magazine é just this week;
 
there are many flies on it but on the whole it's pretty impressive,
 
I think (
score 2 for us).  They also got the in Professor Evaluation
 
Study (known locally as PEST) going and collected 3000 questionnaires
 
the first day!  Apparently the students have something to say and I
 
will be fascinated to see what it is.
 (Score another for us, only
 
feebly counter-acted by a meeting of a faculty and Administration
 
Committee on Student Afit Affairs which met, somewhat belatedly,
 
the day the survey officially started to announce in tones of horror
 
that the statistical methods being used were unscientific and the
 
college would take no responsibility for suits ku by professors.
 Since
 
both the Poly, Sci 9 and Psychology Departments are deeply involved
 
in the methodology used and the college computer center has already
 
agreed to handle and double-check the statistics no-one is taking
 
this very seriously.)  Wnxkaxuxka Our grievance has been refused
 
for the umpth t
ime by the umpth committee to which it was referred;
 
you understand none of them has ever actually heard the  f grievance,
 
they simply take a month to decide that they aren't the right com-
mittee to take care of it; score for them.
 Dr. Ravicz single-
handedly managed to turn the department into total chaos by the simple
 
process of changing al
l the locks day before yesterday --score two
 
for him on the basis of the amount of disruption caused by the simplest
 
procedure.  And so  t goes.
 
Dad is still working; many problems but I think he's wi nni ng  
out.
 He doesn't feel realjy hot; I think the place on his foot where
 
he stepped on the nail is bothering him more than he admits, but he
 
has to go back for a second tetanus shot, and maybe when a doctor
 
sees it he will make him do something.  Jay, the foreman, got arrested
 
for stealing a truck while drunk, an d Ray has  g iven  Da  the job
 
a kind of verbal offer.
 However, the situation is a little sticky
 
because Dad dQesn't know the ropes yet and Jay is still there since
 
his trail doesn't come off yet, so a nobody knows about the promotion
 
but Dad, leaving  im in a very awkward and tricky position. Nick wan-
desr off to school in the morning and home again; he is bringing his
 
grades up I think but not to any x
tx t±1t astounding heights.
 I
 
am hopeful of straight B
's; he is back on his diet and our principal
 
discussions revolve around calory counts, since I discover that he
 
really rates food according to bulk: a small bag of cashews must be
 
less fat aning than an apple because it's half the size.
