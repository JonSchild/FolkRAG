IIE summer time is gone, cold winter'S 
teli 
coming on, 
Twill bring dreary destitution unto poverty's 
door, 
The rich will all be snug while they their fires 
hug, 
Kind people, remember the suffering of the 
poor; 
0°,11 it is risirr,, 
and flour getting dear, 
And ye'll want a 
bran new overcoat for Christ-
mas or New Year, 
So let ye's bear in mind, don't apind your 
money blind, 
Or ye surely will be hungry when the soup 
house comes again. 
There's many a 
noble man with spirit bold and 
• 
c 
grand,: 
IA drove to desperation and accepted charity. 
Last winter was so hard, from alleyway and 
yarn, 
Mr. Bennett got a 
blessing from many a 
family, 
When the snow begins to fall, your landlord he 
will call, 
You must have your money ready when for 
rent he calls your name, 
So let ye's bear in mind, don't spind your 
pinnies blind, 
Or you surely will be hungry when the soup 
house comes again. 
Now all min, . oung and old, unto who these 
words I've told, 
I 
wish ye's all enough to ate, I 
do sincerely, 
With cabbage and corn meat, •praties and pig's 
feet, 
With. plenty may you smother wherever you 
may be; 
But let ye's take advice, look out for wintry ice, 
Arrah! keep your children cosy and snug out 
of the rain. 
So let ye's bear in mind, don't spend your 
pinnies blind, 
Or ye surely will be hungry when the soup 
house comes again.

Oh, they say he's a

Oh a 
bruiser, what a 
ho6sier, 
When h3 borrows your coat you're a 
loser, 
This burn with a 
terrible gaul, 
lie's got an eye in his head like a 
mackerel, 
his neck's as long as a 
crone, 
Tie drinks gruel that's made out of sawdust, ) 
Mixed up with it seven day's rain; 
His clothes wouldn't cover a 
hair pin, 
*Shoot him with a 
big cannon ball, 
You can bet he never would tumble, 
The bloke with the terrible gaul.

Faust in Five Minutes. 
A Medley Musical Ristoriette, written 
for Mr. Howard Paul, and sung in the 
character of Mephistopheles, from. the 
Opera of " Faust." 
Mephistopheles, (log.) 
AI FIND I 
hav'nt got a 
card, but, per-
haps, to cars polite, 
The name of Mephistopheles will cause 
least affright; 
Respecting me, sad fibs are told, some 
friends a mine acquaint me, 
So I've come to show I'm not so black a.4. 
folks delight to paint me. 
Air.—" Come Home." 
You've all heard of Faust as a 
learned 
old sage, 
But he merely was heavy and 'slow— 
_ 
With beer and tobacco, and failing old 
age, 
And gout in the ball of his toe. 
17 
Disgusted with life, ho arranged his af-
fairs, 
.L 
And settled his laundress' bill, 
Then longing to 'de from the world 
and its cares, 
He swallow'd—a llollo:way's pill! 
Oh! Oh! but he merely felt dread-
fully ill! 
[Spoken.]—At this crisis I 
received a 
telegram, requesting my immediate ot-
tendance, professionally. 
Air.—" You Naughty Men." 
To render aid most willing, at a 
pac3 
'twas well nigh killing, 
I 
came up for a 
shilling, by the Smash-
ingtone Railway! 
I 
made a 
stipulation for a 
small consid-
eration, 
And such was the temptation that ho 
could not well say nay! 
I 
promised wealth and blooming youth, 
and all the aids which can 
Create a 
young Adonis from a 
gruffy, 
a 
huffy, puffy, fluffy, snuffy fat old man.

[Spoken.]—Merely as a 
matter of form 
I 
suggested a 
written agreement, whic. 
he seemed shy of "signing, but, perceiiL 
ing his weak point, I 
hit on an ingenious 
device, and raised a 
ghost of the beautit-
ful Marguerite, a 
young person on whom 
he was " spoony." The plan was a 
suc-
cess. 
He instantly put his name to the 
"little bill," and hey, presto! was trans-
formed from an old fogy into—such a 
nice young man! 
Air.—" American." 
They say I 
use unholy arts, ha! ha I 
A thorough mistak on all their parts, 
ha I

Of Mr. Phalon I 
learned the trick, 
And enamell'd him over hard and thick, 
And " Beautiful for ever," quick 
We started for Gretchen's home.

Oh she was passing sweet, down to her 
dainty feet, 
Two flaxen pigtails neat, sweetly hung 
pendulous!

But they were not long happy together, 
Each morn with fresh flowers though

For Fanit, with rich presents of jewels,

Oh deem her not heartless or cruel,

And got me involved in no end of a

But Faust would not stick to ono as he 
really should have done, 
For to galivant with others ho consid-
ered awful fun, 
Tho' with promise of her hand, ho was 
envy of the land, 
A 
proper state of matters that he couldn't 
understand. 
Ho flirted sadly too with a

dressed in Blue, 
And visited the theatre to stare at Black- -

jaw ! 
The cause was removed to the uncom-

bilant sounds, 
Wound up with big damages — 10,000 
pounds.

Air.—Tramp, Tramp. 
Now when Faust the verdict heard, he 
would scarce believe a

Until assured it really must be so; 
Then be vow'd by all that's blue, he 
would'nt pay a 
sous, 
He'd first see Marguerite at Jericho! 
Stamp, stamp, stamp, he off went march-
ing— 
But when the morrow came, to pay,

fright, he had van-
ished in the night,

Words by J. F. Waller. Music at Peters,

II, sweet Kitty Neil, riso up from 
your wheel, 
Your neat little foot will be weary 
from spinning, 
Come, trip down with rue to the syca-
more tree; 
Ralf the parish is there and the dance 
is beginning. 
The sun has gone down, but the full 
harvest moon 
Shines sweetly and cool on the dew.

While all the air rings with the soft, 
loving things, 
Each little bird sings in the green.. 
shaded valley,

shaded valley. 
25 " 
With a 
blush and a 
smile, Kitty rose up 
the while, 
Her eye in the glass, as she bound her 
hair, glancing; 
'Tis hard to refuse when a 
young lover 
sues, 
So she could not choose but go off to 
the dancing. 
And now on the green the glad troops 
are seen, 
Each gay-hearted lad with the lass of 
choosing, 
And ist, without fail, led out sweet 
Kitty Neil; 
Somehow when he asked, she ne'er 
thought of refusing. 
Somehow when he asked, she ne'es 
thought of refusing.

Now Felix Magee puts his pipes on his 
knee, 
And, with flourish so free, sets each 
couple in motion; 
With a 
cheer and a 
bound, the lads 
patter the ground, 
The maids move around just like 
swans on the ocean. 
Cheeks bright as a 
rose, feet light as the 
doe's, 
Now coyly retiring, now boldly ad-
vancing;

WIDOW MACHREE , 
W IDOW M ACHREE, it's no wonder you frown 
Och hone ! Widow Machree. 
Faith ! it ruins your looks, that dirty black 
gown, 
Och hone! Widow Machree. 
How altered your air, 
With that close cap you wear— 
'Tis destroying your hair, 
Which should be flowing free; 
Be no longer a 
churl, 
Of its black silken curl, 
Och bone! Widow Machree. 
Widow Machree, now the summer is come, 
Och hone I 
Widow Machree 
When everything smiles, should a 
beauty 
look glum, 
Och hone! Widow Machree. 
Bee the birds go in pairs, 
And the rabbits and hares— 
Why even the bears 
Now in couples ne.-rfse; 
And the mute little tsll, 
Though they can't spake, they wish— 
Och hone! Widow Machree. 
Widow Machree, and when winter comes 
in, 
Och hone! Widow Machree. 
To be poking the fire all alone is a 
sin, 
Och hone! Widow Machree. . 
Sure the shovel and tongs

While the kettle sings songs 
Full of family glee; 
Yet alone with your cup, 
Like a 
hermit you sup. 
Och hone 1 
Widow Machree. 
And how do you know, with the comforts 
I've towid, 
Och hone! Widow Machree, 
But your keeping some poor fellow out irt .

Och hone! Widow Machree.

With such sins on your head 
Sure your peace would be fled; 
Could you sleep in your bed, 
Without thinking to see 
Some ghost or some sprite, 
That would wake you each night, 
Crying Och hone I 
Widow Maehree. 
Then take my advice, darling Widow lila-
chree; 
Och hone! Widow Machree; 
And with my advice, faith, I 
wish you'd 
take me, 
Och hone! Widow Maehree, 
You'd have me to desire 
Then to stir up the fire 
And sure hope is no liar, 
In whispering to me, 
That the ghost would depart. 
When you'd me near your heart, 
Och hone I 
Widow Machree. 
TARA HMI-. 
CIN the 16th day of August, in the year of '43, 
A 
glorious day, I 
well may say, recorded it shall be, 
On the royal hill of Tara, Irish thousands did 
prevail, 
In maion ,bands to join their hands with Dan for 
the Repeal. 
Then such a 
sight was never 'seen, nor will till 
time no more, 
its lasting fame must long remain all round I1l-
bernia's shore, 
No pen or talent can describe the glories of that 
day; 
la there was seen in Tam green a 
matchless 
grand display. 
There was Wexford, Wicklow and Kildare, sweet 
Dublin and Ardee, 
Westmeath, Roscommon and Dundalk, most glo-
rious for to see, 
Likewise Cork, Tuarn and Waterford, Strahane 
and sweet Kinsafe, 
On the royal hill of Tara stood to sign for the 
Repeal.

LANNEGAN'S BALL 
• ; 
!Ia , 
p
i 
---712 the town of Asthoy lived one. Johnny .; 
z: 
Lannegan, . 
He batteted away till he hadn't a 
pound; 
His father he died, and made him a 
man agailN 
lie left him a 
farm and an acre of ground, 
ti 
lie gave a 
large party to all his relations, 
Who didn't forget when sent to the wall; 
If you but listen, 1'11 make your eyes glisten 
At the rows and ructions at Lannegan's Bali. 
Myself, to be sure, got free invitations 
For all the nice girls and boys that I'd ask; 
In less than a 
minute, his friends and relations 
Were dancing as merry as bees round a 
cask. 
Miss O'Hara, the nice little milliner, 
Tipt me a 
wink to give her a 
call; 
Next we arrived at Timothy Gillegan's, 
Just in time for Lanllegan's Ball. 
There was lashions of whiskey and wine fbr 
the ladies, 
Praties and cake, bacon and tea: 
The Nolans, Dolans and the O'Grady's 
Were kissing the girls and dancing away; 
40 
TA* songs they were as plenty as water, sure, 
,Frony the " harp that once through Tara's 
old Hall." 
.*Sweet Nelly Gray" and the "Rateatcher's 
daugliter" 
Were dancing in couples at Lannegan's Ball 
there was all sorts of nonsensical dancing, 
All around the room; in a 
neat whirligig; 
But Judy and I-soon banished their nonsense, 
For, we lept them a 
step of a 
neat Irish jig; 
Och, Mavourneen I 
wasn't she fond of me I 
We danced till you'd think the old ceiling 
would fall; 
Sure, we spent a 
whole week at Daly's academy 
Learning a 
step for Lannegan's Ball. 
The boys they got gay;and- 
the girls they got 
frisky, 
All dancing together in couples and groups, 
Till 
an 
accident. happened young Brian 
O'ShatiglinesSY.i 
Ilestuck his right foot through Miss Ha-
gerty's hoops; 
p. 
41 
The .rcreature roared and bawled mealy-murthet 
She roared for her friends, till she gathered 
them all, 
Ned B-rding he swore he wouldn't go furthet, 
Till be had satisfaction at Lannegan's Bell. 
In the midst of the row, Miss Cavenagh fainted 
Her cheeks all the time as red as a 
rose; 
The ladies declared her cheeks they were 
painted, 
But she'd taken a 
small drop, too .much, 
bUppose ; 
Big Ned Court day, so heavy and able; 
When he saw his dear Colleen stretehati 
doWn by the wall, 
Be pulled the best leg from under the tabS, 
And broke all the china at Lannegan's Bull 
Oh 1 
bloody wars! and there was the ructions, 
Myself got a 
clout from Phelin McCue, 
I 
soon replied to his kind invitations, 
I 
kicked up the devil's own philimaloo. 
Ould easy, the piper, he nearly got strangled, 
We bundled him up, pipes, chaunter and all, 
The ladies in ribbands they all got entangled, 
And that's put an end to Lannegan's BalL

CRIME. 
As Sung by TONY ?Anon. 
'TE been thinking of late, I've been think 
lag, 
My thoughts I 
can scarcely define, 
I've been thinking why people can wonder, 
At this terrible increase of crime; 
Cries Old Uncle Sam, it's a "poser," 
There's something I 
can't understand, 
I 
would just give a 
trifle to know, sir., 
Why crime should increase in or land. 
I'm sure that we've plenty of gold, sir, 
Our banks are as full as can hold, sir, 
We could buy the whole world I 
am told, sir, 
. 
Yef., still, there's an increase of crime. 
It't true what you say, Uncle Samuel, 
We've plenty of gold laid away, 
ihuldy with mildew and rust, sir, 
Guarded by night and by day; 
V 
you, like a 
dog in the manger, 
Your gold to yourself you confine, 
6o 
When a 
little would make a 
great change, sir, 
In this terrible increase of crime. 
For expenses you don't care a 
groat, sir, 
Politicians, you feed a 
whole lot. sir, 
While the poor man, with hunger may rot, sir, 
And still you wormer at crime. 
Can you wonder at crime, can you wonder, 
When you see the police on his beat, 
Arresting a 
poor starving man, sir, 
For begging his bread on the street; 
While the thief on the cirner stands grinning, 
In the broad open light of the day, 
Your pockets he'd pick for a 
shilling, 
And the law cannot touch him they say. 
He smiles with contempt and derision, 
He defies a 
whole police division, 
While the poor man is sent off to prison, 
And still, you wonder at crime. 
Just think while you're drinking your wine, sir, 
how the poor of our land they are fed, 
While you, with your rich folks can dine, sir, 
'Tis a 
god-send 1,-
dr them to get bread; 
Go visit the home of the poor, sir, 
Such sights you will never behold, 
To our prisons then go and explore, sire 
And scatter your hoardings of gold. 
A 
little would soon break asunder, 
The chains the poor sufferer i3 under, 
Go, list to that great voice of hunger, 
And you'll never more wonder at crime,

GOOD- EVENING. 
CHARLIE J. 
MIRES' Song and Dance.

ers, 5322 Chestnut St., Phila., owners of the copyright. 
I 
HAD been dining rather late, 
The fact I 
think it best to state, 
When I 
strolled out without a 
mate, 
One very pleasant evening; 
By fancy's bent my steps were led, 
As westward through the streets I 
sped. 
A 
lovely figure saw ahead, 
Walked fast and said " Good-evening." 
I 
felt a 
disappointed dunce 
No word she answered in response, 
So I 
repeated more than once, 
" 
Good-evening, miss, good-evening;" 
At length she turned her head this way. 
Judge if you can of my dismay, - 
She's fifty-five if she's a 
day, 
I 
blurted out, " Good-evening." 
sa 
The disappointment made me queer, 
I 
turned into 
public near, 
Addressed the bar-maid thus, " My dear, 
atAobilt!er., 
beer, 
good- evening;" 
With sparkling eyes and ale soon served, 
1 What is it makes me so unnerved, 
Close standing by me I 
observed 
My tailor, who said, " Good-evening.* 
13Is presence spoilt my wish to stay, 
I 
reached the door then heard her say, 
" 
Pleaie pay be;ore you go away, 
Good-evening, sir, good-evening;fl 
" 
Pray pardon, me I 
beg of you, 
I 
quite forgot," and that was true, 
The tailor said, " You often do, 
Good-evening, sir, good-evening." 
I 
felt a 
blush suffuse my fate, 
In such a 
crowd at such dhigace, 
They shouted as I 
left the -place, 
"Good-evening, sir, good-evening;" 
4-

Policeman ten alit& the door 
Increased my misery More andmore, 
He saicl,•-"I"ve'seen your gairie before, 
Get off my beat, good-evening, sir, goott-etto• 
I 
left his beat, it didn't spit, 
To argue with that stupid brute, 
Or hear him echo the alute, 
" 
Good-evening, sir, good evening." 
Into a 
court I 
made:dive, 
I 
A 
fresh street reached more dead than alive, 
Again I 
met Miss Fifty-five, who simpered 004 
"Good-evening, sir!' 
good-evening." 
Things mostly happen for the best, 
If you're amused, I'1,*(waive the rest, 
And with me enjoy t

At my expense thi 
evening; 
But luckily I 
am here 
Where I 
have naught t'io fear, 
And so with kind regal kis to all friends,

I 
beg to say, " good-mening."

The subject of my song. 
The fairest flower that grows, 
The rarest, reddest rose,

She is so sweet and fair. 
Oh, my little Annie Lowry, 
My sunbeam beauty bell.

And bless my hope to get you, 
My sunbeam and my flower. 
The fairest, .86o,. 
How deep in love I 
fell, 
There's none on earth can tell; 
None but the power above me,

Oh, golden day of days, 
Oh, heart that never sways; 
Oh, Annie, queen of beauty,

Whose name was Dolly Dot, 
And while her Pa soled boots and shoes, 
She sold potatoes hot; 
He never stirred from out his stall, 
But Dolly had to roam, 
For she repaired to Madison Square 
While he repaired at home. 
CHORUS. 
Dolly Dot was handsome, Dolly Dot was

And he went round the Square because

The Harp that once through Tara's Halls, 
THE harp that once through Tara's halls 
The soul of music shed, 
kow hangs as mute on Tara's walls 
As if that soul were fled; 
So sleeps the pride of former days, 
So glory's thrill is o'er, 
And hearts that once beat high for praisi 
Now feel that pulse no more. 
No more to chiefs and ladies bright 
The harp of Tara swells— 
The chord alone, that breaks at night, 
Its tale of ruin tells; 
Thus freedom now so seldom wakes, 
The only throe she gives 
Is when some heart indignant breaks 
To show that she still lives.

'W' Couldn't Stay Away. 
Written and Composed by W. II. DEta,ttaziTs. 
AY down in old Kentuckyl;
.. 
Where we were bred and born, 
That rosy, sunny country, 
We used to hoe the corn; 
In childhood's happy moments, 
Our hearts were light and gay, 
We've been to see our birthplace. 
We couldn't stay away. 
CHORUS. 
We couldn't, we couldn't, 
We couldn't stay away from there, 
We couldn't, we couldn't, 
We couldn't stay away! 
I 
once did love a 
sweet one, 
'Way down in Dixie's hind, 
And one day popp'd the question, 
To give my heart and hand, 
She said her heart had been won 
That I 
away iun.,
it stay, 
But that would never suit me, 
I 
could not stay away 
We couldn't, cte. 
We've been out north and westward, 
And southward far away, 
But from the Oriental 
We could no longer stay, 
As all the happy faces, 
That smile on us to-night, 
Doth make us doubly happy, 
And doubly with delight.

Ten Thousand Miles Away. 
As sung by Gus Williams. 
ING I 
for a 
brave and a 
gallant 
barque, 
And a 
stiff and rattling breeze, 
A 
bully crew and a 
captain, too, 
To carry me o'er the seas. 
To carry me o'er the seas, my boys, 
To my true love so gay-ay-ay, 
Who went on a 
trip, in a 
government 
ship, 
Ten thousand miles away. 
Blow ye winds, hi oh! 
A-roaming I 
will go, 
I'll stay no more OD, this wild 
shore; 
So let the music play— 
I'll start by the morning train. 
To cross the raging main, 
For I'm on the road to my owr 
true love, 
Ten thousand miles away. 
87 
My true love she was. handsome, 
My true love she was young, 
Her eyes were blue as the violet's hue, 
And silvery was the sound of her tongiw 
And silvery was the sound of her tongue, 
my boys; 
And while I 
sing this lay-ay- ay, 
She's a-doing of the grand, in a 
far-chi 
land, 
Ten thousand miles away. 
Dark and dismal was the day, 
When last I 
saw my Meg, 
She'd a 
government band around Oita 
hand, 
Aud another one round her leg. 
And another one round her leg, my boys 
As the big ship left the bay-ay-ay; 
."Adieu" said she, " Remember me, 
Ten thousand miles way.-
83 
Oh, if I •Ivere a 
sailor lad, 
Or even a 
bombardier, 
I'd hire a 
boat and go afloat, 
And straight to my true love steer. 
And straight to my true love steer, my 
boys, 
Where the dolphins dance and play-ay-ay 
And the whales and sharks kick up theii 
larks, 
Ten thousand miles away. 
Blow ye winds, etc. 
The sun may shine through an eastern 
fog, 
Or the river run bright and clear, 
The ocean's brine be turned to wine, 
And I 
forget my beer. 
And I 
forget my beer, my boys, 
Or the landlord's quarter day-ay-ay--
But never will I part from my ow*, 
sweet-heart, 
Ten thousand miles away. 
Blow ye winds, etc.

To watch the little fishes, swimming in the sea; 
B'at he'll soon wish for home, and to be back

And so wretched you will be, so wretched you 
will be;

And again she began to sing— 
Salt water, you know, is very wet, Oh, Nicode-

You know -you are my only pet, 
And your absence will cause me to fume and 
fret; 
They will feed you on salt junk and nasty soft 
boiled peas, 
Think of this well: Nicodemus

So she said, & c, 
And she also said— 
of pumpkins boiled you'll get no more, Oh,

Convince yourself of this before, 
You can't run away there's no back door; 
Reef the anchor, Nicodemus, the Captain he wili 
say,

You'll have to hold on by your eyebrows, 
Or you'll be blown away, straight down to Botany

So she said, &c. 
This is what he said— 
its no use you talking to rue; said Nicodeinus I 
For I 
intend a 
going out to sea, 
Out to China for Souchong and Lingo Tea. 
That's a 
profitable cargo, in fact you can't get 
better. 
Direct from Hong Kong, Australia. 
When you send to me a 
letter, you send 40 me a

Oh, Nicodemus, &o. 
Y Killarney's lakes and fells, 
Em'rald isles and winding bays 
Mountain paths and woodland dells. 
Mem'ry ever fondly strays. 
Bounteous nature loves all lands, 
Beauty wanders ev'rywhere. 
Footprints leaves on many strawis: 
But her home is surely there I 
Angels fold their wings, and rest 
In that Eden of the west. 
Beauty's home, Killarney, 
Ever fair Killarney. 
Innisfallen's ruin'il shrine, 
May suggest a 
passing sigh, 
But man's faith can ne'er decline, 
Such God's wonders floating by. 
Castle Lough and Glenna Bay, 
Mountains Tore and Eagle's.Nest, fl 
Still at Mucross you must pray, 
Though the monks arc now at rest. 
Angels wonder not that man . 
There would fain prolong life's span, 
Beauty's home, Killarney, 
Ever fair Killarney. 
To place else can charm tlat eye, 
With such bright and varied tints. 
Every rock that you pass by, 
Verdure broiders or besprints. 
Virgin there the green grass grows, 
E7ery morn Spring's natal day, 
Bright hued berries daff the snows, 
Smiling winter's frown away. 
Angels often pausing there, 
Doubt if Eden were more fair,

beduty's home, Killarney, 
Ever fair Killarney. 
Music there for Echo dwells, 
Makes each sound a 
harmony, 
Many-voiced the chorus swells, 
Till it faints in ecstacy.. 
With the charmful tints below 
Seems the heaven above to vie, 
All rich colors that we know, 
Tinge the cloud wreaths in that 
Wings of angels so might shine, 
Glancing back soft light divine,

NE evening I 
met a 
party gay, 
• ,3 A beau so charming fair, 
Such a 
flowing mustache he did display, 
And raven locks of hair ; 
So noble, line, he danced divine, 
His partner me did choose, 
With such a 
glanc? asked me to dance, 
Now how could I 
refuse? 
CHORUS. 
Of lov 
at first sight I 
have heard, 
AnT often too we see, 
Although it might seem quite absurd, 
It was the case with me; 
For I 
fit love's power in my heart, 
It was no idle ruse, 
For such a 
winning beau to have, 
Naw how could krefuse ? 
In a 
garden a 
quiet stroll we took, 
He begged an interview, 
100 
Oh, I'll ne'er forget his pleai:ing look, 
So modest, graceful too 
Forget! by Jove! my early love, 
Said he, it is no use 
SO 
hear me pray; what could I 
say, 
Now how could 1 
ruse? 
Of love at first sight, etc. 
Now there's no disguise, I'm your cousin, yes, 
That loved you years ago; 
Ilere I 
am returned for what, can you guess ? 
Your hand—do not say no. 
My hand he pressed as I 
confessed, 
My feelings won't abuse; 
Well never part, you've won my heart, 
For how could I 
refuse ? 
Of love at first sight, etc,

.T was only in the month of last November, 
That we heard the news we ever shall 
remember, 
That the Fire King had cast his burning ember 
O'er another fated city in our land; 
As the woful tidinff,s 
along the wire, 
At the terrible catastrophe so dire, 
That Boston's beauteoEs city was on fire, 
And was sinking ' neath the fl ad's relentless 
hand. 
Fire! lire ! was heard the cry, 
In every breeze that passed us by, 
And all the world heav'd one great sigh of pity; 
Strong men in anguish pray'd, 
Fervent pray'r to licav'n for aid, 
-Before the tire in ruins laid Fair Boston's fated 
city. 
And all thru' the terrible commotion, 
The wind blew a 
gale from off the ocean, 
The' the brave firemen toiled with all devotion, 
To laugh at the efforts yet it seenA; 
And soared with its fiery tongue still higher, 
O'er chimney- top, steeple ard spire, 
Till all was one vast wave of fire, 
As the light round the heriz:n gleamed. 
Fire! fire! was heard the, cry, etc,. 
But who saves a 
city in her panic, 
From the rule of the Fire King so tyramnic, 
But the brave-hearted fireman and mechanic, 
The bet and tl e 
noblest in the land. 
Far brighter than the soldier's record gory 
Are the names of those who live in song and 
story, 
Who restore a 
city to her former glory, 
And build her up, if possible, more grand. 
For soon will no trace remain, 
Of all this sea of flame, 
For Boston will rise again, remember I 
Like Chicago from the ground, 
And brave men wi:1 be found, 
Who wi:1 build a 
fairer town, before the next
