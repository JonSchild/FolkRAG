[Mr. Wells?] SIR WILLIAM and LADY MARGARET MARGRET Sir William courted Lady Margaret
Margret so fairAnd intended to make her his wife;But they'd [ / ?] quarreled about some [trifling?]
affair[,?]And it cost then both [ / ?] their life.Said he: I am no man for youAnd you are no girl for
me,But before many days are over and goneTo my wedding you may be.Said she, I'm no girl for
you,And you're no man for me,Before many days are over and gone,To my funeral you may be.Lady
Margret sat in her window high,A-combing her yellow hair.She saw Sir William and his bride riding
by,And to the church anear.
[OK?]
Lady Margret put down her ivory comb;With silk tied up her hair.She threw herself out the castel /
windowAnd never spoke any more.Sir William had a dreadful dream,He dreamed that was not
good.He dreamed his hall was full of white swineAnd his bride's chamber full of blood.Lie still,
lie still, his bride she cried,Dreams seldom do prove true.But it's I will arise and to Lady Margret
go,Without the leave of you.So he arose and straightway went,And knocking at the door;And who
was so ready as Lady Margret's brotherTo open up the door.Oh where is Lady Margret, he cried.Seat
her by the side of [me.?]Lady Margret is dead and under the sheet lies,And she died for the love of
thee.Oh open up the winding sheetAnd let me view the dead.Oh let me kiss those clay cold lips [?]
That once were cherry red.Lady Margret died all as today;Sir William as tomorrow.And they were in
the churchyard laid.On [account?] of a foolish quarrel.They buried Lady Margret in churchyard,And
Sir William in choire;And of her grave there grew a red rose[.?]And out of [Sir?] William's a briar.
(chore)
[?] They grew and grew so very high[,?]They grew till they reached the steeple top.And there the Red
Rose and the [Briar?] did meet.All tied a true lovers['?] knot.
