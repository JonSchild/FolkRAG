My Grandfather Died
MY GRANDFATHER DIED 5129 A1
Sue Putnam Cassadaga, N.Y., 1941
My grandfather died and I can't tell you how He left ten horses to follow the plow And a
wum wum waddy-o Johnny sold his saddle-o Down by the brook
He sold a little horse and he bought a little cow And he never made a bargain but what he
knew how And a wum wum waddy-o Johnny sold his saddle-o Down by the brook
He sold a little cow and he bought a little calf He never made a bargain but what he lost
half And a wum wum waddy-o Johnny sold his saddle-o Down by the brook
He sold a little calf and he bought a little dog And he put it in the yard for to keep away the
mob And a wum wum waddy-o Johnny sold his saddle-o Down by the brook
He sold a little dog and he bought a little cat And he put it in the house for to keep away
the rat And a wum wum waddy-o Johnny sold his saddle-o Down by the brook
He sold a little cat and he bought a little mouse And he put it in the cellar and it ate up all
the house And a wum wum waddy-o Johnny sold his saddle-o Down by the brook.
