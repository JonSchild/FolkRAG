No matter what e'er they may to, 
And you know to be out of the fashion,

Who does not admire " Le Toilet," 
And enchanted scan over each pare? 
But the mode

Dolly Va.rden! Dolly Varden

Dolly Varden! Dolly Vardcn! 
With all pretty girls now the rage. 
'Twas at a 
Pic-nic in the summer, 
Invited we were to "a 
sis'," 
And as ' Cousin Gussy," was going 
How cou:d we the ofir resist ? 
As a 
rule his attentio - s 
to me, 
:Were of that kind some folks would remark, 
But this day with some far Doly V, 
He flirtad and roamed thro' the Park. 
CHO.— 
When we next met he seem'd quite alarmed, 
When I 
call'd him "a 
flirt nothing less," 
With the lady.'twas not he was charmed, 
But the swc et Dolly Varden like dress. 
SO 
now I've adopted the same, 
Love ard constancy be does engage, 
Tho' I ''always look charming' he vows, 
That gweet Dolly Varden's the rage.

As sung by Miss Jenney Hughes 
Oh! have you seen the fashion sir, 
We do not wear a 
bonnet, 
We've got a 
monstrous flip-flop hat 
With Cherry ribbons on it, 
We dress now in bed furniture, 
Just like a 
flower-garden 
A growing and a 
blowing, 
And they call it Dolly Varden. 
CHORUS. 
Dolly ! Dolly 1 
Dolly ! Dolly Varden, 
Dresses like a 
little flower garden, 
As I 
go about the people shout 
Dolly ! Dolly ! Dolly ! Dolly Varden. 
I 
purchased it one fatal day, 
Immediately my mother, 
Whose wei;ht is nearly half a 
ton, 
Rushed out and bought another, 
Miss Snaith---a.nd Jones must have one too. 
They're as bo:d as a 
brass farden, 
And now I'm blessed if grandmother, 
Has'nt got a 
Dolly Varden. 
CHO.— 
I see I 
t 
in my dreams at night, 
No rest I 
ever find sirs, 
I've Dolly Varden on the brain. 
And Chintz upon the mind sirs, 
This fearful fashion haunts me now 
I 
really beg your pardon, 
But is there any body here, 
Who wants a 
Dolly Varden.

0, Squeeze Mc, Joe. 
to sung by Miss Jennie Hughes. 
In Harlem Lane, there once did dwell a 
charming little beau, 
With whom I 
walked and sometimes talked, his christian name 
[was Joe ; 
I 
knew that he was fond of me, though he never told me so, 
But when my hand in his was pressed, I 
said 0 
squeeze me Joe. 
0, Squeeze me, 3oe, 0, Squeeze me, Joe, 
it makes rae fiNI so jolly you know ; 
0, squeeze me, Joe, 0, squeeze me, Joe, 
And if you love me tell me so. 
lie kept a 
pretty little farm, and horses he had three, 
So he said, my dear, there'll be no harm to take a 
ride with me, 
Ile did and slipp'd from off the horse, and caught me you must 
[know: 
Then placed his arm around my waist, when I 
cried, don't 
CII0.— [squeeze me Joe. 
lie popp'd the question there and then, he did upon my life, 
And said my little darling, will you really be my wife; 
I 
gave a 
sigh, then raid, 0 
ray, I 
really can't say no, 
l'll be your wife and joy through life, if you'll only squeeze me 
Ci710.— [ Joe 
I 
married him then, and now am happy as can be, 
Fer the little farm, and all its charms of course belong to me, 
And when he says, I'm going away, to town for a 
day or so, 
I 
can't do less tha.n give a 
kiss, and say, 0, squeeze me, Jcc

It's Naughty But It's Nice. 
As sung by T:ris3 :eunie IItt:hes. 
There's lots of things you know, 
Wherever you may go, 
That we should never undertake to do, 
Although it charms the eye, 
We ought to pass it by, 
It would be better if we only knew. 
My Mother used to say, unto me every day, 
When you see a 
pie don't always want a 
slice, 
I 
used to go up stairs and take it unawares, 
All the while I 
knew ' twas naughty but ' twas nice. 
clionus. 
Oh ! it's naughty but it's nice, and we like it so, 
'Tis sure fellows do wrong to entice, 
No matter what you see, you never can agree, 
All the while you know its naughty but it's nice, you bet ! 
We go to see our girls, with lots of pretty curls, 
To pass the time so pleasantly away, 
We praise the little dears, and drive away their fears, 
And such lots of sweet nonsenco to them say. 
And when it's late at night, 
The stars are shining bright, 
To kiss them, why it gives to life a 
spice, 
Our arms around their wa'.3 ts, del ightfully are placed 
All the while we know it's.naughty but it's nice. 
Military Style. 
As sung by .Mis .7ennie HughPs. 
One day the Park while ranging, 
Close to the marble arch, 
The 9th. their quarters changing, 
I 
met upon the march, 
Their dresses gay my senses charmed, 
As they marched rank and file, 
I 
vowed to join them and adopt ; 
Their Military 
Oh, how do you like the military style girls, 
Oh, how do you like the military style, 
Blow the trumpet, beat the drum, 
See the conquering hero comes, 
Oh, how do you like the military style. 
To excursions I'm devoted, 
And always enjoy the day 
I'm sure to be promoted, 
For merit not for pay / 
I've read the deeds of General Grant, 
But in a 
little while, 
I 
fancy I 
shall cut him out, 
In Military Style, 
When the Corn is Waving. 
As sung by Miss Jennie Hughes. 
When the corn is waving, Annie dear, 
Oh, meet me by the stile, 
To hear thy gentle voice again, 
And greet thy winning smile. 
The moon will be at full, love, 
TLe stars will brightly gleam, 
0 
come, my queen of night, love, 
And grace the beauteous scene. 
CDC-J.—When the corn is waving, Annie dear, 
Oh, meet me by the stile, 
To hear thy gentle voice again, 
And greet thy winning smile. 
When the corn is waving, Annie dear, 
Our tales of love we'll te:1, 
Beside the gentle flowing stream, 
That both our hearts know well. 
When wild flowers in their beauty, 
Will scent the evening breeze, 
Oh haste, the stars are peeping, 
And the moon, behind the trees. 
CIO.—When the corn is waving, Annie daar, 
Oh meet me by the stile, 
To bear thy gentle voice again, 
And grent thy winninz

I 
Sat Esau Kissing Kate. 
Twas just about a 
year ago, 
When I 
was down at Glo'ster, 
I 
foun1 a 
LIS3 but now, alas 1 
I 
find that I 
have lost her. 
For sure I 
never can forget, 
The happy days that we saw 
&fore the day on which we met 
Her country cousin Esau. 
4Spoken.—For it was on that unlucky day, that— 
CHORUS. 
I 
saw E3.311 kissing Kate, 
And the fact is—tve all three saw, 
For I 
saw Esau, he saw me, 
And she saw I 
saw Esau. 
I'd rather go without my beer, 
Or even get my sconce hurt, 
Than ever go again to hear 
A 
Crystal Palace Concert, 
For I 
took Kitty there, and then, 
Unfortunately she saw 
That horridest of countrymen, 
Her country cousin Esau. 
Spoken.—But even then I 
never thought 1 
should 
hava to say—C110.— 
She introduced this man to me, 
And soon, behind a 
statue, 
I 
saw what made me audibly 
S:ng out, ' I'm looking at you," 
'Tis sad indced to have to state, 
What poor unlucky me saw, 
For there was Esau kissing Kate, 
And Kate was kissing Esau. 
Spoken.—Yes I 
they had commenced the business 
arithmetically, they began with simple addition, 
went right through subtraction, and would have 
gone on to multiplication, had it not been that— 
. CHO.— 
Is this why you both quitted me! 
Said I, ycu I:ttle Tartar I 
Oh yes! said she, the Rule of Tree, 
Is not so good as Barter. 
I 
went to school with him, she said 
And used to play at seesaw, 
So, if you please, I 
think I'll wed 
My country cousin Esau. 
Spoken.— Well, said 1, I 
came here to a 
concert, 
but this is a 
concerted piece I 
didn't tApect to see. 
I 
scarcely knew what to say, for it was enough to 
disconcert me altogether, when—C110.— 
I 
went away in quite a 
pet, 
And toddled home to tea, oh! 
For I 
could see that their duet 
had put me up a 
tree oh 
But still my sorrow wasn't great, 
When in the papers we saw, 
That Mr. Esau' d 
married Kate, 
And Kate had married Esau.

Nary Red or the Bummer's Lament. 
Oh, where is my money all gone to ? 
And where are the frieacli I 
us2d to treat? 
Now I 
can't get a 
drink when I 
want to, 
And they call me a 
played out DEAD BEAT. 
Once I 
Stamps had, and friends too, in plenty, 
But alas, they have a!1 long since flown 
Now my stomach and pcp:hets are e:ntpy, 
And l've not got one led to ca:1 my own.— 
Chorus. 
Nary Iled,—Nary red, 
Nary slm;le red cent to call my own,— 
Nary Led,—Nary 
d,— 
Nary single red cent to call my own. 
I 
am bloatod, forlorn, and dejected, 
And my clothes are all ragr:ccl and coarse, 
I 
am homeless, ckspised, t.ud ne:lecled, 
And am covered with shame, and remorse, 
Oh, where have the treasures been banished, 
That were mine when the girls I 
used to court, 
Where's my suit cf fine broad-cloth now vanished, 
And the handsome watch and chain I 
used to sport. 
Chorus. 
Up the spout, at my Uncle's, 
You'll know the place by them three golden 
Up the spout, at my Uncle's, [ Balls, 
And the Rumsellers got the money all. 
Now one night as I 
lay on some lumber, 
And was sleeping as quia as a 
mouse, 
A Policeman dropt in on my slumber, 
And snached me to the Central altion House. 
In the morning tho' I 
wanted a 
Hummer, 
I 
was brought Le:bre squire Char-call, who says: 
Now I 
see by your face yeu're a 
Bummer, 
So I'll send you up for thirty days. 
Chorus. 
Thirty days,—thirty days, 
Was the sentcnce often passed on me before, 
Thirty days,—tl:irty days, 
Fo he sent me up for thirty days once more.

And tired now, and sleepy too,— 
So put me in my little bed. 
Come, & ster come, kiss me good night, 
For I

AWFULLY CLEVER, 
As sung by Miss Jennie Hughes, 
I've a 
renal' who does'nt like bothah, 
All trouble to him is a 
bore, 
lie's an income. 12.1, him by his mothaw, 
\Vhat on earth could a 
follah want more; 
his favorite sport's killing time, 
His aim's to do nothing at all, 
While some in this world run and climb, 
lie takes the trip easy and crawls. 
For they tell him he's awfully clevah ; 
Oh, so clevah, deuced clevah, 
They say that they nevah, no nerah, 
Yet a 
fellah, so clevah before. 
Some fellahs go in for the Amy'? 
And some fellahs go in for trade, 
lint he hasn't such bores to alarm him, 
His fortune was already made. 
And some fellah3 go in for brain, 
And scribble to earn an honest penny, 
Those fellahs deserve all their gains, 
As for brains he could do without any. 
In the park he is often seen driving, 
Ile thinks he's Alexis, the duke, 
Whenever he goes in for hi 
lie thinks he's a 
hard one to fluke. 
Some times at an evening party, 
To keep us alive in he'll peep, 
Whenever we ask him to sing, 
We are certain to fall fast asleep,

Once He was a 
gay young Clerk. 
As sung by :Miss Jennie Hughes. 
I'm the girl that's always laughing, 
I'm so very merry all the day, 
Nothing can annoy or fret me, 
I'm as happy as the flowers of May, 
some are crying, some are sighing, 
I'm so jolly and perhaps you'd like to know the reason, 
Can't you guess it, I'll confess it, 
I'm in love with such a 
nice young man. 
CHORUS. 
Once he was a 
gay young clerk, 
In a 
Broadway dry goods store, 
But now he's joined the city militia, 
And I 
love him all the more. 
My love he is a 
high private, 
That is nothing very great you say, 
But he's learnt how to salute me, 
And embrace me in a 
military way, 
When parading and arrayed in 
A 
grey coat without a 
single dollar in his pocket, 
Could you but see him you would love him, 
For he's really such a 
nice young man, 
CHORUS. 
Once he was a 
gay yonng clerk, 
In a 
Broadway dry goods store, 
But now he's joined the city militia, 
And I 
love him all the more. 
The Bashful Girl. 
As sung by Miss Jennie Hughes t 
I'm a 
stupid bashful girl, 
How I 
titty-ti-ti-tremble, 
Seeing just to hear me sing, 
Such a 
multitude assemble, 
Oh, pray don't, or I 
won't, 
Sing a 
note if anybody look at me, 
flow I 
quake, how I 
shake, 
Verily timidity's a 
dreadful thing 
Gentlemen I 
chance to meet, 
Make me niny-ni•ni- nervous, 
And I 
never walk the street, 
Without saying heaven preserve 
How they stare, I 
declare 
I 
get red as any peony, 
Look so meek that they speak, 
Oh, George ! isn't she a 
very, very Bashful Girl. 
Won't some gentleman be my friend, 
Like a 
bibby-bi-bi-bi-brother, 
Telling me my fault's to mend, 
And this silly shyness smother, 
If I 
can find a 
man, 
Who belives in love that is platonical, 
I 
might get courage yet, 
Really I'm a 
very, very, bashful Girl.

I'm very fond of muFic, 
To me it's quite a 
treat, 
Unless it be from German Bands, 
Or Organs in the street, 
Thro' list'ning to a 
Band one day, 
I 
fairly lost my heart, 
The Leader ' twas who found it, 
And he now with it won't part. 
CHORUS. 
Oh I 
I 
feel so awfully jolly when the Band begins to play 
The B 
Ind begins to play, 
When the Band 1K,gini to play, 
Pm so very fund of music, I 
could listen all the day, 
Especially when my Charlie leads the Band. 
Porn. 
Porn. 
My Charli,! 
is my darling, 
The beau ideal of loves, 
With his hair s 
D black and curly,. 
And his whit -st of whlte gloves, 
My love st Inds in the middle, 
With his Baton in his hand, 
And leads the Instrumentalists, 
In a 
style that I 
think grand. 
CEO.— 
They play such jolly music, 
Waltz, Polka and Quadrille; 
And sometimes play so feelingly. 
It gives me quite a 
thrill ; 
The Le ',der sometimes gives a 
frown, 
And looks as though he's rash ; 
And then they play so soft and sweet, 
And after comes a 
crash. 
CB O.— 
Now where my Charlie's to be seen, 
I 
don't intend to tell ; 
For fear that he might captivate, 
Some other Belle as we 1; 
lie's asked me one small question, 
I 
gave him ray reply; 
In about a 
month there will not be 
A 
happier wife than I.

THE BASHFUL YOUNG LADY. 
Music published in B. IV. Hitchcock's Half Dime series. 
Oh I 
good gracious I 
I 
hope I'm not going to faint— 
Oh 1 
this bashfulness is such a 
dreadful complaint 1 
I 
am so confused, and my cheeks are so hot I 
Oh! don't look, or indeed, I 
shall die on the spot 
It is so distressing—nobody, I'm sure, 
Would belive what it is that I 
have to endure : 
What I 
suffer' d 
at dancing, and lessons at school, 
Where I 
had to stand out by myself on a 
stool 1 
Where I 
had to stand out by myself on a 
stool. 
If I 
venture to sing it's so dreadful to know 
That I 
look like a 
peony out in full blow; 
And it is so provoking wherever one goes, 
To be called by the gentlemen "couleur de rose" 
If asked to take wine, there's that saucy boy, Ned, 
With his " Cousin, ahem! can I 
help you to red ?' 
And if ever I'm ill, there's that wretch,Doctor Scott, 
With his " Really, can't say—Scarlatina, or not." 
If I 
should have an offer !—Oh 1 
what have I 
said ?— 
If there is one thing on earth it is that that I 
dread— 
Yet, would you beleive it, that horrid Mamma, 
Says, " That is carrying bashfulness rather too far." 
I 
only do hope, if it should be the case, 
That the gentleman won't look me quite in the face; 
For, indeed, if his suit be too warmly should press, 
extremely afraid I 
might blush, and Fay—"Yor."1

ON BROADWAY. 
Words by George L. Stonte, and expressly adapted to the air 
of " Piccadilly for Miss Jennie Hughes. 
You talk about your languid swells 
Who Central Park parade; 
But there's a 
gent, I 
know right well, 
Who throws them in the shade; 
But where he lives or what's his name. 
I 
do not wish to say, 
But no first time that I 
met this gent, 
'Twas on the gay Broadway. 
CHORUS. 
On Broadway, on Broadway, 
For elegant swells, and the fairest of Belles; 
On Broadway, On Broadway, 
That's where I 
am seen when in town, 
This handsome gent I 
sing about, 
This dashing Broadway swell, 
has pearly teeth and deep blue eyes, 
And Blonde moustache as well; 
And like Adonis is his form, 
lie always dresses gay, 
With a 
nobby air and curly hair, 
lie walks in gay Broadway, 
CHO.— 
I 
meet him at the matinee, 
And much do him admire, 
But when he looks me in the face, 
I 
think I 
shall expire; 
At the Comique he buy's a 
chair, 
But more I 
dare not say. 
Of course"you know the Comique is 
Five fourteen Broadway.

KILLARNEY. 
published in D. W. Hitchcock's Half Dime series. 
By Killarney's lakes and fells, 
Em'rald isles and winding bays, 
Mountain paths and woodland dells, 
Mena'ry ever fondly strays. 
Bounteous nature loves all lands, 
Beauty wanders ev'ry where, 
Footprints leaves on many strands; 
But her home is surely there 
Angels fold their wings, and rest 
In that Eden of the west, 
Beauty's home, Killarney, 
Ever fair Killarney. 
Innisfallen's ruin'd shrine, 
May suggest a 
passing sigh, 
But man's faith can neer decline, 
Such God's wenders floating by, 
Castle Lough and Glenna Bay, 
Mountains Tore and Eagle's Nest, 
Still at Mucross you must pray, 
Though the monks are now at rest. 
Ange's wonder not that man 
There would fain prolong life's span, 
Beauty's home, Killarney, 
Ever fair Killarney. 
No place else can charm the eye, 
With such bright and varied tints, 
Every rock that you pass by, 
Verdure broiders or besprints. 
Virgin there the green grass grows, 
Every morn Spring's natal day, 
Bright-hued berries daff the snows, 
Smiling winter's frown away. 
Angels often pausing there, 
Doubt if Eden were more fair, 
Beauty's home, Killarney, 
Ever fair Killarney, 
Music there for Echo dwells, 
Makes each sound a 
harmony, 
Many-voiced the chorus swells, 
Till it faints in eestacy. 
With the charmful tints below 
Seems the heaven above to vie, 
All rich colors that we know, 
Tinge the cloud wreaths in that sky. 
Wings of angels so might shine, 
Glancing back soft light divine, 
Beauty's home. Killarney, 
7var fair Killarney.

WINKING AT ME. 
Kind friends, your attention 
I'll ask for a 
while; 
And I'll try to amuse you, 
In my simple st:,•1:-. 
To sing to you nig-litip, 
Its a 
pleasure, I 
see, 
For the gents in the house 
All keep winking at me. 
Winking at me, winking at ma 
Now how can I 
sing, 
While they're winking at me. 
There's a 
gentleman sitting 
Down there on the ri, lit; 
He came lure to day, 
In a 
terrible plight. 
He's lately been jilted, 
fly a 
fair one, you see, 
And now he comes here, 
And keeps winking at me. 
Winking at me, winking at me. 
Now how can I 
sing, 
While he's winking at me. 
There's a 
gent sitting there, 
Dressed in elegant taste, 
fly the side of a 
lady, 
His arm round her waist. 
An artful deceiver I 
fear he must be, 
For while he makes love to her, 
He keeps winking at me. 
Winking at me, winking at me, 
Now how can I 
sing, 
While he's winking at me?

anDucks. 
As sung by Miss Jennie Hughes. 
Whenever ducks go two by two, 
They're surely got something in view, 
And what it is they will not tell, 
Although themselves they know it well, 
They smoothe the feathers on their back, 
With a 
loving quack, quack, quack, quack. 
CDORUS. 
Quack, quack, quack, quack, 
And little ducks words never lack, 
Tra oh la uh, Tra In, tra la nh, ah 
Quack, quack, quack. 
Whenever ducks go three by three, 
It puzzles much both you and me, 
Are there two drakes and but one duck, 
Or but a 
single drake in luck. 
They smootbe the feathers on his back. 
With a 
loving quack, quack, quack,quack. 
CHORUS. 
Quack, quack, quack, quack, 
And little ducks words never lack,

TOMMY'S nETURN. 
I 
missed it, dear Father, most sadly I 
know, 
To cast all your counsels away, 
To riot with idlers and lounge about so, 
But judge not too harshly, I 
pray. 
I'm wretched, degraded, and poor it is true, 
And rags are my Only array, 
But to my transgressions, I've bidden adieu, 
Then, Father, forgive me, I 
pray! 
CHORUS. 
0

welcome back home, 
No longer to sin or to roam! 
The hearts that have lov;d you rejoice as you come, 
We welcome, we welcome you home. 
Dear Father, I 
come like the " Prodigal Son." 
I've skned against heaven and thee; 
I 
ask but a 
place in the old cott:r,e home, 
Once more your own Tommy to be. 
The fancies I 
cherished so fondly in youth, 
Long, long since, have vanished away, 
The counsels you gave me, I 
found to be true, 
Then, Father forgive me, I 
pray ! 
CHO.— 
Again and again, I've repented in tear; 
And prayed to my Father above, 
My sins ti lorgive, to remove n'l my fears, 
lie heard in in mercy and love. 
Forgiveness, dear Father and Mother, I 
crave, 
For the sorrow I 
caused you to know, 
For God in his mercy is able to save 
Your Tommy from ruin and woe.

The last time that I 
met him, 
Oh, how happy then were we, 
But to-night I 
am a

If he only knew his sister, 
Was a

BEHOLD a

Who is not too fond of fighting,

Don't Marry a 
Man if' He Drinks. 
Music of this Song to be obtained at florace Waters' Music Store, 
No. 481 liroatiway, New York. 
YOUNG 
ladies, pray listen to me, 
And keep just as quiet as mice, 
While I 
sing you a 
song, it is not very long, 
Which contains quite a 
piece of advice. 
Spoken— It is this: 
No matter what people may say, 
No matter what somebody thinks; 
If you wish to be happy the rest of your days, 
Don't marry a 
man if he drinks, 
Dont marry a 
man if he drinks. 
He may be so handsome and gay; 
And have such a 
beautiful voice; 
And may dance so divinely you'll feel in your heart 
That he must be the man of your choice. 
If, his 'accents are tender and low, 
And sweeter than roses and pinks, 
And, his breath quite a 
different thing, you may know 
Your exquisite gentleman drinks. 
'Tis no matter, &c. 
Just think of the sorrows and cares, 
The heart-rendin, sighs and the fears, 
Of the words aud the blows, and the cruelest woes, 
And then think of 11.11 ocean of tears. 
Think of Toodles, the drunkest of men, 
His attitudes, hiccoughs, and winks— 
And then think what a 
dignified pair you will make, 
If you marry a 
man and he drinks. 
'Tis no matter, tic. 
Young ladies, look well to your hearts, 
Don't throw them away on a 
sot; 
Or a 
man who is given to treating his friends, 
Whate'er be his station or lot. 
Though his pride may uphold him awhile, 
Yet sooner or later he sinks; 
Then if you would be happy the rest of your days, 
Don't marry a 
man if he drinks. 
no matter, ac.

Drunkard's Lone Child. 
OUT in this gloomy night sadly I 
roam, 
I've no mother now, no friends, no home, 
Nobody cares for me, no one would cry, 
Even if poor little Bessie should die. 
Barefoot and tired I've wandered all day, 
Asking for work, but I'm too small, they say. 
On the damp gruund. I 
must now lay my head, 
Father's a 
drunkard and mother is dead. 
Clloncs. 
Mother, why did you leave me alone, 
With no one to love me, no friends and no home. 
Dark is the night, the storm rages wild, 
God pity Bessie, the Drunkard's Lone Child. 
We were so happy till father drank rum, 
Then all our trouble and sorrow begun. 
Mother grew paler and wept every day, 
Baby and I 
were too hungry to play. 
Slowly they faded, and one summer night 
Found their sweet faces all silent and white. 
And with big tears slowly dropping I 
said, 
Father's a 
drunkard and mother is dead. 
Oh! if some temp'rance man only could find 
Poor, wretched father and speak very kind, 
If they could stop him from drinking, why then 
I 
should feel very happy again. 
Is it too late ? 
Men of temp'rance, please try, 
For little Bessie will soon starve and die. 
All the day 1O-ng I've been begging for bread— 
Father's a 
drunkard and mother is dead. 
The Bird on the T'ree. 
Words by FRANK W . 
GREEN. Musie by ANTIIONY NISH. 
THE bird, on the tree is singing his song, 
So sweetly to me the whole evening long; 
How happy and gay, how joyous and free, 
He is with his song, sweet bird on the tree. 
The daylight is fleeting, the moon shines above, 
'Tis thue for our meeting, 0, Cora, my love. 
To guide thee to me, dear, the woodlands along, 
The bird on the tree, dear, is singing—is singing 
his song. 
CHORUS.

The bird on the tree sings carols so clear, 
his song full of glee now falls on mine ear; 
Then haste to me, pray, I

And fain would be g,ty like the bird on the tree. 
The blossoms are sleeping, the wind softly sighs, 
The fair stars are peeping above in the skies, 
To guide thee to me, dear, the woodlands along, 
The bird on the tree, dear, is singing—is singing 
his song.

Awfully . 
Good Form. 
I'm not by any means a 
swell, 
At least the sort one sees about, 
Apollo don't sit on me well, 
And dandified get up I 
scout; 
My hair with perfume is not clank, 
My bands with rings I 
do not deck, 
And, as for money, not a 
bank 
Would ever cash my check! 
Spoken—But I 
come out of the ruck simply 
and solely because— 
I'm awfully good form! 
I'm awfully good form! 
Where'er I 
go, in park or row, 
The men all mutter, 
And the girls are in a 
flutter, 
For I'm awfully good form! 
I'm awfully good form! 
In park or row, where'er I 
go, 
I'm awiully good form! 
The slangy gent sings very small 
Whenever he comes into range, 
The West- end suits him not at all, 
He reeks of Mark Lane and of ' Change; 
He never seems to have enough 
Of rings and pins in doubtful gold, 
He's great in collar and in cuff, 
And scarf of many fold. 
Spoken.—I 
couldn't match him in these—and 
only depend on this— 
I'm awfully good form, & e.

OH ! where is our dainty, our darling—

The silvery laugh in the hall ? 
Oh! where is our dainty, our darling—

The apricots ready to fall: 
The blue grapes are dripping their honey 
In sunshine upon the white wall : 
Oh ! where are the lips full of inciting, 
That looked up so pouting and red, 
When we dangled the sun-purpled bunches 
Of Isabels over her head ?

His Heart was True to Poll. 
Am :—" In 1869." 
I

chant, 
Which now p'r'aps isn't new, 
Of Billy Kidd, who, whatever he did, 
To his Poll was always true. 
lie sailed away in a 
gallant ship 
From the pretty port of jovial Bristol, 
And the last words as he uttered, 
While his handkerchee he fluttered, 
Were "My heart is true to Poll." 
My heart is true to Poll, (
business) 
No matter whit you do, 
If your heart is ever true, 
And his heart was true to Poll. 
They were wrecked. William, to shore he swam, 
And he looked about for an inn, 
When a 
noble savage lady, of a 
color rather shady, 
Came up, with a 
cheerful grin; 
Says she, "Marry me, and a 
king you'll be, 
And in a 
palace loll, 
Or they'll eat you like a 
fi:et ;" 
So he gave his hand, did Billy; 
But his heart was true to Poll. 
My heart is true to Poll, &e. 
So William Kidd a 
happy life led 
As the King of the Kika,roos, 
lie had nothing but a 
hat upon his head, 
And a 
pair of over-shoes. 
They made him a 
present of twenty wives, 
Which their beauties I 
cannot now extol; 
But one day they all revolted, 
So he back to Bristol bolted, 
For his heart was true to Poll. 
My heart is true to Poll, &c. (Dance.)

Marry in Haste and Repent ' at Leisure. 
As sung by Fete Morris. 
The Music, published by Oliver Ditson & Co., 227 Washington 
Street, Boston, can be obtained at the well-known Music-Store 
of C. IL Ditson & 
Co , 711 Broadway. 
How silly to marry! why did I 
not tarry ? 
'Tis foolish to marry in haste : 
For, little's the pleasure repenting at leisure, 
Nor is it at all to my taste. 
My lover seemed kind and so very refined, 
Such whiskers and nice curly hair— 
Ills marmozet tricks got my heart in a 
fix, 
That till now was a 
stranger to care. 
Oh! dear Oh! Ah I 
How silly to marry—why did I 
not tarry ? 
'Tis foolish to marry in haste: 
For little's the pleasure repenting at leisure, 
Nor is it at all to my taste. 
Scarce a 
month has flown, I 
do nothing but sigh, 
And my husband does nothing but snub: 
Between me and you he n'er comes home till two, 
And says he's detained at his club. 
To increase my despair, his jet curly hair 
I 
discovered was false—(how I 
cried!) 
When he doesn't go out, its thro' having the gout, 
And his beautiful whiskers are dyed. 
Oh ! dear! &c. 
He's quite an old beau, and too late I 
know 
I 
shall never be happy again: 
For, now I 
can see it was money, not me: 
What cruel deceivers are men ! 
Some say : " serve me right—" I 
took such delight 
In coquetting, but kept my heart free. 
If fate should ordain that I'm single again, 
What a 
smart little widow I'll be! 
Oh! dear! &c.

She burnt two big holes in my heart, 
With her splendid eyes of blue; 
I 
felt the world was naught to me 
For I 
loved her—wouldn't you? 
I 
waited until the play was o'er, 
And quickly stepped to the door, 
And waited to see this little belle, 
As she passed on before. 
As I 
followed up the street, 
A 
fellow with a 
reddish snoot 
Says: " Why are you staring at my wife? 
You ugly, big galoot." 
She burnt, & c. 
I 
saw I 
was mistaken and in a 
fix, 
For his temper was rising high. 
I 
told him ' twas by accident we met, 
And he banged me in the eye. 
They walked off and left me there, 
With my eyes I 
scarce could see; 
I 
swore I'd never flirt again 
With girls at the matinee.

Ain't it Nice to Have a 
Bean? 
BY 
ARTHUR W . 
FRENCH. 
AS you out a 
walking go, 
When the crowds are in the street, 
Passing by you to and fro, 
Oft by chance SOME ONE you meet; 
Soon he's walking by your side, 
With his arm in yours—just so— 
Looking down on you with pride— 
Ain't it nice to have a 
beau ? 
CHORUS. 
Ain't it nice to have a 
beau, 
One who loves you well, you know, 
As you out a 
walking go— 
Ain't it nice to have a 
beau ? 
Arm in arm you stray along, 
Envied by each single lass, 
Who from out the passage throng, 
Jealous glances on you cast. 
And the swells that try to flirt 
Find that they have got no show, 
Deeming you so proud and pert— 
Ain't it nice to have a 
beau ? 
By and by you reach the door, 
While, of course, just there and then 
Words of love HE whispers o'er, 
Saying he will come again. 
Loving lips to yours are pressed, 
And you murmur softly—oh! 
Don't you wish you knew the rest ? 
Ain't it nice to have a 
beau ? 
46 ; 
Ask -Mamma, 
BY H ERVE. 
THEY doat on my dear eyo of blue, 
And they praise up my tresses of gold, 
No matter if false or true 
The love- tale, provided it's told— 
"

Oh ! ivould ho might fancy me .. 
And, oh ! don't my old head go whirl, 
Thinking and dreaming of she !"

Ah!

They sigh for existence with5me 
In a

Proposing the town to flee, .

Like unto two turtle doves I"

Ah ! ah I

Broken Down, 
ONCE I'd money plenty, 
And friends, too, by the score; 
Then fortune smiled upon me, 
And no one passed my door. 
Now I'm poor and lonely, 
And not worth five cents, 
No one seems to know me— 
I'm completely broken down. 
CHORUS. 
I 
wander thro' the world, 
And meet with many a 
frown: 
No one seems to know me'now, 
Because I'm broken down. 
With an ample fortune 
I 
went it rather fast, 
The pace was almost killing, 
And I 
found it couldn't last. 
Too proud to put the curb on, 
I 
thought myself high-bred 
But now for want of " bread" at times, 
I 
have to "fast" instead. 
The immortal Shakespeare 
Says: " Aline world's a 
stage," 
And every man must "play his part," 
From childhood to old age; 
And when I 
think of days gone by 
How I 
was made the tool 
Of rogues and sharps, 'tis then I 
know 
"My part," has been " the fool." 
Friends could recognize me, 
When Poole he made my coat; 
But when .' 
had no "note ta change," 
flow soon they "changed their note I" 
An object sad and needy, 
I 
wander thro' the town, 
A. living parodox am L: 
"Hard up," yet "Broken Down."

DID you mean what you said when you told me 
Yon'd love me thro' good and thro' ill, 
And long as your lifetime you'd hold me 
The centre of happiness still ? 
Did you not speak as men speak too often, 
With words of no meaning at all,

The bosom they mean to enthrall ?

Around the fond tone of your voice, 
And mute tho' the language it utters, 
It beats but to hear and rejoice 
Nay, let not my words give you pain, love,

And make it stick out like a

Some have their weakness on whiskers, 
But mine wouldn't grow, ' pon my soul!

Contented with my natural charms,

As blithe as blithe can be; 
For let the times be good or bad,

For where the dog-star never glows,

Where a

Digging dusky diamonds all the season round, 
Down in a

How little do the great ones care— 
Who sit at home secure— 
What hidden dangers colliers dare, 
What hardships they endure 
The very fires their mansions boast 
To cheer themselves and wives, 
Mayhap were kindled at the cost 
Of jovial collier's lives.

Then cheer up, lads, and make ye much 
Of every joy ye can;

For what would nations he without 
The lads that look for coals ? 
Down in coal mine, &e.

With working in the vein; 
And, like the clothes upon my back,

not the collier's heart that's wrong, 
'Tis the head that goes astray. 
Down in a

At every shift, be't soon or late,

You Never Miss the Water Till the Well 
Runs Dry. - 
When a 
child I 
lived at Flushing with my parents at the 
farm, 
The lessons that my mother taught to me were quite a 
charm. 
She would often take me on her knee when tired of child-
ish play, 
And as she pressed me to her breast I've heard my 
mother say: 
CHORUS. 
Waste not, want not, is a 
maxim I 
would teach, 
Let your watch-word be despatch and practice what you 
preach, 
Do not let your chances like suntetms pass you by, 
For you never miss the water till the well runs dry. 
Waste not, &c. 
As years roll'd on I 
grew to be a 
mischief-making boy, 
Destruction seemed my only sport, it was my only joy, 
And well do I 
remember when oftimes well chastised, 
How father sat beside me, and thus ha 
t% me advised: 
Waste not, &c. 
When I 
arrived at manhocd I 
embarked in public life, 
And found it was a 
rugged road, bestrewn with care and 
strife, 
I 
speculated foolishly, my losses were severe, 
But still a 
little voice kept whispering in my ear: 
Waste not, &c. 
Then I 
studied strict economy and found, to my surprise, 
My funds instead of sinking very quickly then did rise, 
I 
grasped each chance and always struck the iron while 
'twas hot, 
I 
seized my opportunities and never once forgot: 
Waste not, &c. 
I'm married now and happy, I've a 
careful little wife, 
We live in peace and harmony, devoid Of care and strife, 
Fortune smiles upon us, we have little children three, 
The lesson that I 
teach 'them as they prattle round my 
knee:

If Ever I

I

To my love like a

And swearing on my bended knee, 
If ever I

May sheep's heads grow on apple trees, 
If ever I

May the moon be turn'd into green cheese, 
If ever I

She can jump, she can dance, she can run, 
In fact she's a

And Sinis Reeves rolled, into one. " 
And who would not love such a 
beauty 
Like an angel dropped from above, 
May I 
be stung to death with flies,' 
If ever I

If ever I

May little dogs wag their tails in front, 
If ever I 
cease to love.

For all the money that's in the bank, 
For the title of a 
lord or a 
duke, 
I 
wouldn't exchange the girl I 
love, 
There's bliss in every look. 
To see her dance the polka, 
I 
could faint with radiant love, 
May the Monument a 
hornpipe dance 
If ever I 
cease to love. 
May we never have to pay the Income Tax, 
If ever I 
cease to love. 
If ever I 
cease to love, 
If ever I 
cease to love, 
May we all turn into cats and dogs, 
If ever I 
cease to love. 
May all the seas turn into ink, 
May negroes all turn white, 
May the Queen in Buckingham Palace live, 
May we drink too much wine to- night. 
May cows lay eggs, my fowls yield milk, 
May the elephant turn a 
dove, 
May Bobbies refuse tc eat cold meat,

That's Where You Make the Mistake, 
SOME folks think they're awfully clever, 
That all other folks are but fools, 
Some people will often endeavor 
To make other people, theii• tools;

And fancy they're well wide awake, 
That none are so deep or so cute as themselves. 
That's where they make the mistake.

Thero's just as good fish in the sea, bear in mind, 
As those we have managed to take; 
So don't be too proud, and don't crow too loud,

For that's where you make the mistake. 
Den% imagine you'll meet with a 
bobby, 
-When'er there's a 
row in the street; 
Don't imagine you'll find a 
fishmonger 
Declare that his fish are not sweet; 
Do not fancy you'll meet with a 
cabby, 
Who more than his faro will not take, 
May as well think an oyster could climb up a 
tree, 
And there you would make a 
mistake. 
If you fancy a 
girl dislikes a 
small kiss, 
You must be—well, what some folks call a 
cake. 
If you think your collector of taxes won't call,

When courting, don't write spooney letters 
To your fair one, for love nor for sport, 
For should you but break any promise, 
They are sure to be read out in court. 
When you wed, do not marry the famly as well, 
For that will not a 
paradise make; 
Above all, close the door to your mother-in-law, 
Or that's' where you'll make the mistake. 
But, talking of marriage reminds me,

Your duck may p'rhaps turn out a

The Men That We Ought to Avoid, 
A man is oft known by the friends that he keeps, 
or birds of a 
feather we find, 
Will oft flock together—and so to the fact, 
It is right we should never be blind 
How many a 
hope of advancement in life, 
Has been by false friendship destroyed; 
So it cannot be wrong to name in my song, 
Some men you ought to avoid. 
CTIORUS. 
Some sham to be gold, but with plenty of brass, 
You'll very soon find them alloyed, 
A man who seems this, and proves to be that, 
Is a 
man you ought to avoid. 
There are men who will borrow at every chance, 
Whom 'twere better at once to offend, 
But the danger is worse in knowing a 
man, 
Whose business is ever to lend, 
He has interest in you and from you as well, 
And e'en if of cash you're devoid, 
Your uncle who hangs out the three golden balls, 
Is a 
man that you ought to avoid. 
A 
lawyer.who runs up his six-and-eight fees, 
A 
drunkard with unsteady gait, 
A 
braggart whose talk is all rull of bombast, 
As of wisdom is empty his pate; 
A 
liar whose word is a 
pitfall and snare, 
A 
parson whose time is employed 
Informing on crimes for the sake of the fines, 
These are men that we ought to avoid. 
The egotist praising his own paltry deeds, 
Who'll of nothing but self ever speak, 
The smooth, fawning, oil talking, cat sort of man 
The tale-bearing, tit-tattle sneak; 
These all are the pests' of our snug little isle, 
By which we are oftimes annoyed, 
Like sharks in the sea or flies in your tea, 
They are things that you ought to avoid.

The New

A 
little book has lately appeared in print at Messrs. Fisher & 
Denison's, 98 Nasdau street, called "The Little Flirt." We cannot 
say that we recommend it to our young 
lady and gentlemen readers, 
as we think it would only encourage the bad h-. bit of "flirting." 
Unfortunately there is enough of it done without any further neces-
sity of explaining "how; when dud where to do it," and this little 
volume would advise 1kt-
id init late the uncorrupted in practising what 
is commonly called "fin ( lug."

We have lately seen a :lea little book, bound in morocco, coding 
25 cents, called "The Little Flirt," published by Messis. Fi-licr 
A. 
Denison, 98 Nassau street. 
It gives information of the mantas oper-
andi of flirting, and of the meaning o every motion of the hand-
kerchief, fan, glove and parasol. As there is nothing at all objec-
tionable in the volume, and its contents might afford some innocent 
amusement to many, we do not hesitate to recommend it to our 
young lady and gentlemen readers.

trations.

up, and flirting the leaves rapidly over, can make it ap-
pear to be filled with copies of only one picture, or with 
blank pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of 
figures. 
One minute the pamphlet, quickly thumbed, 
appears to contain nothing but portraits of Harlequin, 
in his tesselated snit; the next, only Columbine; then, 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or Mephistb-
