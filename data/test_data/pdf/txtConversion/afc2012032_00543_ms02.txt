Janet Stecher Interview Log 
 
0:00:02.6 Debbie Fant introduces herself on tape: October 14, 2013, interviewing Janet Stecher 
at her home at XXX, Seattle, XXXXX.  
 
0:00:34.0 Fant gets general biographical information for the Occupational Folklore Project form.  
 
0:01:32.0 Janet's parents were both children of immigrants--first persons in their generation in 
New York who got a college education. Both became teachers, and both were anti-
establishment. They were not content to believe what they were told and encouraged critical 
thinking. That had a huge impact on Janet and her brother because their opinions were listened 
to as they were growing up. They were encouraged to be articulate. Both parents were 
progressive politically, interested in family resources and personal resources--time, money, 
effort--going to the welfare of all. That was a common theme in their household. It conflicted in 
junior high school years when Janet wanted to go to the movies, or a party, or shopping, but 
instead they were going to the United Nations to protest against the atmospheric testing of 
nuclear weapons. "That's where we're going today!" It had an impact in that she was not able 
to be as like her friends as she'd wanted, but now she's grateful for that.  
 
0:03:12.5 Janet has done many things for a living. The first real job she had was coordinating 
international exchange programs in New York City for the International Division of the YMCA. 
During the Cold War, it was the only organization allowed to do exchange programs with the 
Soviet Union. They were camp counselor programs for youth--the U.S. sent over people in late 
teens and early 20s, and the Soviet Union sent back people in their 50s and 60s--bureaucrats 
who had earned the privilege to leave the country. 
 
0:04:13.7 One of the people who applied to be on the international camp counselor program, 
but in Europe, not in the Soviet Union, was Susan Lewis, who became her singing partner, now 
for over half her life. She and Susan were in the Belles of Hoboken when they lived in New York. 
Susan had come into the office, she worked downtown a few blocks from the World Trade 
Center, in a Greek diner. She wanted to go to a nice place like Sweden where she didn't have to 
know another language and be a camp counselor. She'd taught at the U.N. School, in 
Edmonton, Alberta, she was a dancer--very good at what she did. Janet ended up sending Susan 
to Siberia. When they're on stage, frequently Janet introduces Susan by saying, "I sent Susan to 
work in a camp in Siberia!" That was Janet’s first job. It was while working there that she did a 
lot of American folksong programs for international students. She worked a lot with 
international students in New York.  
 
0:06:17.8 She'd been a capable singer since birth. Her parents were teachers--father a professor 
of physics at Cooper Union, and her mother taught early childhood creative music and drama at 
elite private schools in New York City. She cultivated both the analytical and creative parts of 
herself. The disciplines of math and music and art were natural parts of her because of her 
parents.

0:07:12.5 Janet was singing American folksongs to international students. Susan came to be 
part of that program when she came back, and they asked her to do report-backs to 
communities about what she'd learned in Siberia.  It was a justice issue. Susan had become 
aware that the U.S. Government had been lying to her--people in the Soviet Union were not 
monsters! What was the humanity they had in common? Why was it important to get to know 
people in other parts of the world so that you were less likely to kill them?  
 
0:07:49.2 That was a huge transformation for her, she became a critical thinker about the U.S. 
Government. Then they discovered they both sang. Janet’s singing career began at the same 
time her international coordinating experience began. The international work allowed her to 
travel a lot to recruiting organizations in Europe. She knew hundreds of people who were 
grateful to her for a great experience in the United States, and she had simply shuffled their 
paper. Their communities had given them the wonderful experience. But when Janet visited, 
they were very grateful to her. Along the way she learned many different languages. It was easy 
for her to do with her math abilities and musical abilities, absorbing a language quickly.  
 
0:08:49.4 Janet did that for five years. She lived in Europe for a year, came back and 
coordinated an international exchange program again, a transportation program. They ended 
up firing her for two reasons: One, her immediate supervisor thought she was insubordinate 
because she didn't like the way Janet spoke with her mother on the phone. Two, when the 
head of the international organization came through the office, he was smoking a cigar. And 
Janet asked him not to. So, insubordination. But the real reason was that she was organizing a 
union along with some of her other friends. She joined the project that was in full swing. It was 
easy for Janet to be outspoken, so she was a good target.  
 
0:09:57.1 Went back to Europe to live for quite a while. When she came back, she and Susan 
were doing lots of work with the trio Belles of Hoboken, but they both wanted to live 
somewhere other than New York. So they started looking around the country for other places 
to live.  
 
0:10:21.6 Meanwhile, she began working for an old friend who had first come to New York as a 
bum. His parents were friends of Janet's parents, so they knew each other from childhood. He 
had worked off-Broadway as a sound technician. He became a BBC Reporter, and was living in 
New York and was a "stringer," and he wanted someone to be his Fixer. A Fixer is someone who 
makes things firm. So BBC London would call his office, and his office was a studio in the West 
Village where she began her work early in the afternoon. BBC London would call, and Janet 
would answer in his bedroom, which was his living room and his kitchen and his garage, and 
they'd say "We want to do a report about the differences between the East and West Coast 
filmmakers." Okay, how many would you like?  “Could you do de Niro? Scorsese?” So she would 
hang up the phone and call Tom wherever he was, because it was before cellphones. "They 
want you to interview these really weird guys. How am I supposed to get them?? “There's this 
BBC website where all the famous people have their phone numbers.” She'd call up and get 
someone like her, or an officious secretary, or you might get "Marty!" who answers his own 
phone when you call Scorsese.

0:12:23.1 And she’d say, "Hi. This is Janet Stecher, calling from Tom Brook's office at the BBC. 
We're doing this set of interviews in New York and someone else is doing West Coast to 
compare the differences between the coasts." "Sure!" "What's good for you? Let's have a 
couple of times, and we'll get back to you.”  
 
0:12:47.8 That was a significant experience—for two and a half to three years she was his Fixer. 
She ceased being intimidated. She learned that intimidation was between "me and me." The 
power that she projected onto other people had nothing to do with them. So that was 
extremely useful as she went through life. Everyone was as good or not as good as she was. 
Everyone was her equal. That was important about learning to elevate or dismiss herself and 
what she was willing to do with other people.  
 
0:13:42.9 Tom went on to be the BBC Desk and became famous, he was the first reporter on 
the scene when John Lennon was killed and kept a payphone line open for 48 hours across the 
street from the Dakota. His voice became a significant one that people related to, and he got 
promoted along the way.  
 
0:14:13.2 Janet went to work, then, for a friend of Tom Brook's.  He was a music director for Joe 
Papp's Public Theatre, Bill. He'd lived in a garret in the East Village and was a music director for 
Joe Papp. Then he worked on a show in the park, Pirates of Penzance. It became an enormous 
success, when to Broadway and to movies. He became filthy rich and bought the apartment he 
was in, knocked the wall down, and needed some help. All his mail for the previous two years 
was under the bed. So Janet became his assistant and learned more about how things worked. 
It was a very interesting job.   
 
0:15:10.4 Janet and Susan Lewis and Marcie Boyd were still singing as the Belles of Hoboken. 
Marcie introduced them to the People's Music Network Songs of Freedom & Struggle. They had 
merged--two organizations originally. These were outstanding writers of contemporary songs 
that addressed social justice issues--Charlie King, Fred Small, Betsy Rose--the folks of the early 
1980s who were doing the writing. The folks who are still in it are Pat Humphries in San Diego, 
Magpie, The Harrises. And Pete Seeger was certainly a significant part of the community. The 
Belles of Hoboken repertoire had all been about personal politics:  right to choose, feminism, 
the anti-phobias, the sexual preference equity, racism, what choices did an individual make 
about the way they were in the world, and how they wanted to better it. When they were 
introduced to the writers in the People’s Music Network, they began to learn more about the 
analysis behind equitable communities and that a lot of it was worldwide policy and economics. 
That was when Janet began to learn a lot more about making decisions about how one impacts 
social structures.  
 
0:17:12.1 It was the early introduction to how the structures that would help counteract 
injustice--like unions--would be significant, and how the history of the labor movement was 
intertwining with other movements. But there was yet to be one more catalyst.

0:17:34.2 She and Susan were both looking for somewhere else in the U.S. to live and they had 
a short list. They found that Seattle not only met every criteria that each had on her list but 
added new ones they didn't even know one could measure a city by. There was recycling! (It 
was in the supermarkets, not yet curbside). Accessible public transportation. Notices in public 
transit about what social services were available for the elderly, other groups that might be in 
need. It was a wonderful place to live! So each decided to move to Seattle. It took about a year. 
Each moved within a few weeks of one another.  
 
0:18:39.7 Moving to Seattle, her first musical association, though she and Susan still sang 
together casually as a duo, she sang with Shelly and the Crustaceans during the last few months 
of their many-year existence. They had had 17 dancers and 9 musicians, but by the time Janet 
came along they were about 8 musicians and no dancers. Had costumes and a great repertoire 
that was predominantly anti-nuclear material, making the world safer against nuclear weapons 
and safe against nuclear power.  
 
0:19:40.4 Her politics were broadening even more. She and Susan went to the Seattle Folklore 
Society's song circles that happened every Sunday--still do. They let it be known they were 
looking for another partner or partners to sing with, and this was the material they wanted to 
sing about. That was their introduction to John O'Connor and Tim Hall, with whom they ended 
up forming Shays’ Rebellion. John O'Connor was a very prolific songwriter. Most of his songs 
had to do with justice, most workers' justice. Tim is a multi-instrumentalist. Together they were 
a good balance of the various skills needed to make a good quartet. It was through John, his 
new materials and the hundreds of songs he knew about the century of organizing that Janet 
and Susan learned about the history of the Labor Movement.  
 
0:20:54.4 They joined the Musicians' Union. Each time a new piece was introduced, they asked 
what the story about it was. That was how they began to learn about the Labor Movement and 
the significance of being in a union. The significance of joining with others in coalition because 
you're far stronger in a union than you are on your own.  
 
0:21:18.9 That was her musical and political evolution, which peaked after meeting John, 
forming Shays’ Rebellion. They then had a personality as a group, a lot of politics, a big 
repertoire, and she started to become a union activist through her music.  
 
0:21:51.0 Her other work was running a naturopathic clinic for almost 19 years as a day job. It 
was not a union job--she worked alone, an occasional helper, many doctors. She ended up 
being a caregiver for her mother, who had dementia for ten years. She also ended up going 
back to independent work as a bookkeeper--the analytical part her father had cultivated. She 
became the first founding director for the Seattle Labor Chorus and a bookkeeper for many 
other small organizations. She's also a volunteer coordinator for large and small events that 
have to do with justice.

0:22:51.3 Frequently she works at the Northwest Folklife Festival coordinating the Labor 
Community Show. The last couple of years she's coordinated, with other people, MayWorks, a 
month-long celebration of labor through the Washington State Labor Council.  
 
0:23:14.8 Janet joined a union when she moved to Seattle. When she was in New York and was 
helping to form a union, she thinks it was Service Employees International Union (SEIU).  
 
0:24:06.6 Janet sees herself as a community activist, predominantly. It's generic. How it 
manifests might or might not be lucrative, but the engine that drives it all is the work with 
others to make sure that there is more justice for *many* others. She was a reluctant 
conductor for the Labor Chorus. They asked her and she said no. But once others got on board 
and dug themselves into a hole they couldn't get out of--rhe musical part of the Chorus needed 
to get going. She then said yes. It's a huge job. She has wonderful relationships with the Chorus, 
and the Chorus itself has good relationships with the community.  It serves the community.  
 
0:25:20.3 Janet is a member of two locals of the Musicians Union: Seattle Local 76-493, used to 
be two locals, one for whites and one for blacks that merged at the end of the 1900s. She's also 
a member of Local 1000, the "unlocal" for traveling musicians. She was one of the founding 
members of that. John O'Connor was pivotal in seeing that union came to be. Unions that serve 
the needs of organizations that were geographically centered had different needs than 
someone who was in a different locale every night. She's also been, on and off, a member of 
the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). She loves their history, it's mostly a symbolic 
membership.  
 
0:26:49.0 DF: What's different about being a member of a union that doesn't require you to be 
a member to do the job you have. Many musicians aren't members of a musicians’ union.  
 
0:27:05.6 Janet has joined for political reasons. She still tours with the duo Rebel Voices. If they 
have a contract with someone who doesn’t fulfill it, they'll have all the resources of the union 
to help them deal with it. If they didn't get paid and needed the money to get to the next city, 
the union would front them the money. The union would take the contract to court. There are 
many ways the union might be able to serve Janet practically. But she joined for ideological 
purposes.  
 
0:27:51.5 The old IWW expression, the longshore expression, is really what it is:  "An injury to 
one is an injury to all." Also the converse is true, a benefit to one is a benefit to all. One needs 
to be mindful that as any individual or small group is affected by circumstance or the power of 
another organization, even though it's not YOU, you're next! Even if you do it for selfish 
reasons, selfish or altruistic, being mindful that you want to build a society that will take care of 
everyone? You'll rotate in with your need for support from other people. If your small 
community ends up needing support from other portions of the community, if you haven't 
been standing with them at some point, why should they stand with you? Some people will do 
that because they're wiser than you. They'll stand with you because they know the reason to 
stand with other people. You want to serve the well-being of all, because to borrow a phrase 
Washington State Workers 
afc2012/032

from governments she doesn't approve of, it really *does* "raise all boats." But you have to put 
something into that sea, you can't just keep taking from the sea and say it will raise all boats.  
 
0:29:26.4 We're on the same planet, we share the same water, the same air, consequences 
affect everyone. That's what she is--a community activist at heart.  
 
0:29:46.4 DF: We've talked about this in the past, but union membership is declining nationally. 
Why do you think this is true?  
 
0:30:01.4 JS: She's no expert, so it's a very personal observation. One of the most significant 
reasons is that there is a concerted effort by people in power to see that it occurs. There's a ton 
of evidence--it's not a conspiracy theory. It's transparent, easy to see. Janet can't quote chapter 
and verse of the history of where it's occurred, but she could come back with a list. There are 
some cultural components, as well. “We live in a very individualistic society, our media, our 
reality show, our "Queen for a Day," our lottery--*I* will be the one who's chosen.  It will be ME 
who will climb out of this. And the way I'll do it is through luck and fortune.” The idea that you 
might create a society where everyone has enough begins to sink as a priority because you 
might spend the $50 a month that you could put into your retirement fund when you're 20 that 
will give you half a million dollars when you're ready to retire--though she does believe in Social 
Security--but should you instead buy lottery tickets because you'll be the winner?  You *won't* 
be the winner, AND you *won't* have a retirement fund! The notion that you put your 
resources into something that will be "flukey," that cultural component, doesn't help. In the 
United States you get these messages constantly that "you pull yourself up by your own 
bootstraps and create your own fortune."  Yeah.  
 
And you do it on roads that were paved by the community, paid by taxes, and you learned how 
to read and write in a school that was paid for by taxes from the whole community, your 
education, your early health care--all the things that made you what you are were made by 
your society. Now that you can make something out of that foundation, and you do that own 
your own, and you don't pay taxes to give back to the community so that other people. There's 
something wonky about that. Living in that society--that soup--affects peoples' notions that 
they might work together to benefit all. Or most.  
 
0:33:14.6 Democratic organizations really have a bad name in our society, and it's unfounded. 
Not to say that individuals don't do crummy things, but if someone is a mass murderer and 
happens to be an Aquarius, that's not WHY they were a mass murderer! That's not why they did 
it. It's playing fast and loose with adjectives, when somebody has certain behavior. When you 
have political parties for whom the point is to be as destructive to an individual as possible, and 
other political parties that are trying to be as ethical as possible--though there's an asterisk 
because she thinks the parties are beginning to look more like each other.  
 
0:34:20.4 But when historically, lying is the norm, and we have a press culture that doesn't feel 
it has to double-check anything that hits the airwaves, then you have a society that begins to 
believe what they hear. And what they're hearing is that organizations are to blame. Unions are 
Washington State Workers 
afc2012/032

to blame for their situation. And their situation is that there are insufficient resources. Instead 
of saying something like, "If these workers make a living wage, and their bosses make an 
OUTRAGEOUS wage, and I make less than these guys over here, I should pull them *down* to 
my level. Because my bosses make even more off of me." Instead of working together to create 
a society where everyone had enough at the very least, and the folks who have way, way, way 
more than they need have a right to profit.  
 
The fundamental thing is people have a right to live healthily, safely. They use their bodies to 
create wealth for someone else. Someone else is using their wealth to make wealth for 
themselves--they're risking a dollar bill. The rest of us workers are risking our bodies, our lives, 
our time. We're risking resources we have few of. We have a society that is now deregulated to 
such a degree that it's considered the highest priority, that you protect people's economic 
rights rather than their basic human rights. Those basic rights have been created by every 
organized government on earth--universal rights. People have a right to be safe, not hungry, 
protected. Those are the sorts of things that unions fight for. They join together with each other 
and decide what *we* want to come up with--it's not a THEY, it's an US.  
 
0:37:05.9 If we're busy doing our jobs and want someone else to represent us, to help 
negotiate, because the rest of us are earning a living, that's not a “they,” it’s an “us.” People 
elected to the government are an US. We've asked them to represent us. If they don't, you 
change it. 
 
 0:37:36.6 It's not the system that's broken. Maybe some individuals are not behaving well and 
give our organizations a bad name. Some church members could give a whole church a bad 
name. “I like people of deep beliefs. Might not be my beliefs, but ethics are significant.” If some 
individual goes awry, to paint the whole organization is not a good idea.  
 
0:38:16.8 Many components in our society are working against the notion that we as a 
community can better our systems to better our situation, to better the likelihood of our future 
and our planet. There are just a few people who are in charge because they managed to have 
government representatives who did not do the will of the people, that the people didn't 
realize their interest wasn't at heart. Those individuals deregulated--that's what made our 
banks fail. It's an illusion that everyone can win.  
 
0:39:08.5 There are a lot of components that led to the fiction, and we're in a situation we have 
to undo. And can only do it if we work together.  
 
0:39:21.9 “I don't know the future of the Labor Movement because there are too many 
components working against this version of the Movement. But working together in coalition to 
better the welfare of us all, it will never go out of style no matter what you call it.” Maybe less 
governmental role. Other institutions might be involved.  Cooperatives are another way that 
business is beginning to form itself. Workers are a part of all levels of how business runs. Who 
knows what will be next?

0:40:05.7 This version we have now is not the version we started with. But there will always be 
a role for working with each other.  
 
0:40:20.8 DF: I want to talk a little about your role as conductor of the Seattle Labor Chorus. 
What is it? Who belongs to it?  
 
0:40:55.2 Janet is not the real founder of the Labor Chorus. Others--Lou Truskoff, Scott Reed, 
Ross Rieder, and Bob Barnes, had the notion that a Labor Chorus was needed in the 
community. In 1997, Pete Seeger agreed to come out to the University of Washington for a 
labor conference. It happened to be the week prior to the Northwest Folklife Festival. For 
decades, that festival had been trying to get Seeger to come out. His condition for presenting at 
the Folklife Festival, since he'd be out here already, was if there was a Labor Chorus to back him 
up, he'd agree to stay longer and do some presentations at the Festival. [There are more details 
in the video that will be attached to this interview.] The aforementioned group got together 
and found a place to rehearse--the Carpenter's Hall. Got advertising in the political community 
and the folk community for singers. And they contacted Geoffrey Fairweather, the then-
director of the New York City Labor Chorus to come out and direct the chorus for the weekend 
and send a repertoire. But they had nobody to teach the material to the singers. So after they'd 
done all that, they came to Janet. She's a part of the community that gets together regularly to 
sing songs of peace and justice. She'd been a performer and workshop teacher for decades, so 
she can teach music fundamentals of music but hadn't conducted. "Janet, would you please, 
please help us?" She couldn't believe she said yes, they only had ten weeks to get it together.  
 
0:43:27.6 Material was accessible. She had to figure out how to teach the music to a hundred 
people who had *very* different levels of musical knowledge. It became clear that she had to 
teach several ways: by looking, for those who could read music. By listening, so they could hear 
and repeat. By doing--they just bumbled and succeeded along and got the experience and were 
able to hold it and learn the music. She taught the music over and over. That's stayed with the 
Chorus. They teach in any way that will help an individual master the music.  
 
0:44:15.9 After that first year, about 50 members of that original chorus decided they wanted 
to continue. They spent the entire summer writing a constitution. They asked Janet to consider 
being the conductor, and she agreed. That was 1997, and this is 2013. It was quite a while ago. 
Since then, she's done everything.  
 
0:45:04.4 Her condition for being the conductor was that responsibilities be shared. She 
requested/demanded that there be committees that would be in charge of all of the aspects of 
running an organization: repertoire, what would be sung, how to make it musical, production--
what did they need to know about the venue, the components of microphones, etc. 
Membership, Outreach. Those were requirements. And everyone would be *requested* to be a 
part of some committee. They are a totally non-audition chorus, so anyone who came on didn't 
have to have a particular level of musical ability. They had to agree to a set of behavior: That 
you be respectful. When rehearsing, that's all they do. No time for visiting--just listening or 
singing. That's it. There are dues requested to support the organization, but if someone doesn't 
Washington State Workers 
afc2012/032

have the resources, they're not required to pay. Negotiate something else to give to the 
community. 
 
 0:46:49.1 Janet requested all that be part of the structure before she became the Director, but 
it didn't happen that way, so over the years she's done it all:  She chose and arranged the 
repertoire, negotiated with whomever they sang for, did stage managing and announcing, the 
outreach. And then along the way many people have stepped up and become active in 
committees, and now they ARE doing all that stuff. As Janet ages and is aware that at some 
point she'll need to step out of that role, she's confident that the organization can do just fine 
without her. People are rising to learn to do all the components together.  
 
0:47:42.2 There are many versions of, "If you wanted to be on a deserted island, who would 
you want to be with you?" Janet would want her chorus. They're incredibly skilled at so many 
aspects of being community, or planting a tree, or baking a cake, or building a cabinet. The 
swath of humanity are the members of the Chorus. People who are running the other justice 
organizations in the city, union heads, people who deal with services for the homeless, 
teachers, truck drivers, librarians, nurses, home care workers, the unemployed, the retired, 
homemakers, musicians!  
 
0:48:44.5 DF: Given that the Chorus starts out with people, if it's a non-audition chorus, who 
have really got to work to get their skills up to a level that works for the whole of the Chorus. 
(Yes.) How does that work, and when do you know that the Chorus has done a really wonderful 
job?  When is it that you feel you've achieved what you want to achieve?  
 
0:49:26.4 Janet is willing to give extra rehearsals to any individual who is trying to catch up. 
They encourage people to start at the beginning of the season, which is September, and they go 
to the end of May or the first of June. Unlike most choruses, they don't have a repertoire only 
for that year and do a big concert with that repertoire. They learn six to twelve songs every 
year, and they keep every song they've ever learned. They sing for the community, at the least, 
once a month, and sometimes four times a month. They have 20-40 gigs a year. They need the 
repertoire that's appropriate for the event. There are many songs in the canon of the Labor 
Movement that need to be drawn on and need to be sung again and again because the 
community wants to sing along. And then there are the new ones that have a different take. 
But they're not just singing for workers. They're singing for environmental organizations and 
peace organizations and homeless organizations--organizations that help overcome any 
inequity and injustice. So they've built a very large repertoire.   
 
0:50:52.5 Folks who come in in September are learning the songs in that same way that she 
described when she was trying to prepare the first Chorus for Geoffrey Fairweather. They have 
printed music, for people who can read music. Janet sings or plays every part over and over and 
over, so they learn by doing. If people need a little extra help, she has extra rehearsals 
beforehand. They have sectional rehearsals. People come to her house and she works with 
them. They have "catch-up" sessions for new members to learn the repertoire that everyone 
else knows. They've started having "lateral workshops," where members teach each other. The 
Washington State Workers 
afc2012/032

"Technical Excellence" committee decided the Chorus has a lot of musical skills, so why don't 
they teach each other? So once or twice a month they choose a time and have a session where 
they teach each other whatever it is--how to memorize, what does the “staff” mean, what are 
values of notes, what are different things about rhythm, how to find intervals, how to tone 
match. And in the summer when they supposedly don't practice, they have workshops where 
they work with percussionists, with singers who have another repertoire from another culture, 
they learn about the physiology of singing. They do all sorts of things all year long as well has 
have lots of parties.  
 
0:52:41.7 For Janet, a chorus is a great metaphor for politics, "in union we are much more than 
as a single voice." Even though there is an individual who has not developed strengths in all of 
the arenas that might enable them to become a good soloist, when singing in a section when 
somebody else is taking the lead, in union, in this larger organization that has its subplots--you 
have the many in your section. And then your "many" in the chorus, and your "many" in the 
community. Each association emboldens and informs and empowers the individual to have a 
better shot at mastery each time it's attempted. Among all the textures of the voices in the 
Chorus, they end up together having this great pull. It reminds her of a large picture that looks 
like a photograph of a face or a landscape, and when you hone in on it close up it's made up of 
a lot of photos. And then you zoom out again and it makes something else entirely. That's what 
the Chorus is like.  
 
There are certain individuals that, when they are being their individual selves they are quite 
discreet. But when you yield to the needs of the whole for the time period that you're singing, 
or performing, or even setting up a picnic site, there's a larger picture which is quite beautiful 
and functions. Because you've merged your own needs with the needs of the many, and you 
end up with a stunning larger picture.  
 
0:55:12.0 One of the things that gives Janet great joy is she acknowledges what a gift it is that 
the Chorus allows her to "play" them. They are an instrument. They have worked hard all year, 
or all month, to learn how to be their string or their mallet, whatever it is that's part of the 
whole instrument. And when they're in performance, they let Janet play them. They know what 
they're going to sing, but they don't sing it the same way every time. What the dynamics are 
depend on how they're feeling, the rate at which they're singing, they accelerate, they 
decelerate. So many of their songs deal with the history of working folks, with the history of 
how people have worked together to accomplish what they need. So many of the songs are 
laden with a huge "history" of what people have been through. When they're learning the 
songs they try to remember that. Janet tries to give hand signals that start out quite large about 
what it is they're aiming for, and the signals get smaller and smaller. But it's still supposed to 
evoke what it is that they want to get at. So the smaller gestures that had months of larger 
meanings now inform them of where they're going, how do they feel about this, what are the 
larger stories they're remembering when they're in the piece. They have emotional cues, and 
they've worked hard on the technical part, and they let Janet "play" the moment so that the 
dynamics can vary.

0:57:24.2 DF: How does she know when they've done a good job? JS: When she's watched 
them be utterly transformed by the experience of having delivered the performance. And Janet 
is equally moved. That's how she knows.  
 
0:57:41.5 In 2013, Janet doesn't know how many people are actually in the Chorus. There's no 
requirement to come to rehearsal unless you're actually going to perform, then you are 
required to make sure you come to at least two rehearsals before the performance so Janet 
knows each person has all the information needed for *that* particular performance. She 
would say between 40 and 50 people. Usually about 35 at a rehearsal. Age ranges--mostly old. 
She thinks the youngest member might 25 or 28. Their oldest is probably 80. Most of the 
members are in their 50s and 60s.  
 
0:58:38.9 Janet has no idea where they'll get new younger members. Most of their repertoire is 
"folk." The market to consume "folk music" is not one that is cultivated in our culture now. It's 
not that she's interested in people consuming the music, but they're not exposed to the style. If 
someone grew up going to camp or grew up in a family that was interested in the music, they'll 
have been exposed to it and will have an emotional connection to it. Unless individuals of an 
age group have that kind of exposure, they won't know about the music. If they're political 
activists, they will know about it, or begin to know about it, because the history of the music of 
these centuries of campaigns is primarily the focus, the style. People are going to have to 
stumble on it. She doesn't think the Chorus has ever been at an event where a young person 
heard the material and didn't like it. But if they don't hear it, they won't like it.  
 
0:59:56.7 There's also the unfortunate circumstance that in the history of demonstrations and 
rallies, any version of a song was considered better than nothing at all. And there are many 
individual presenters that may not have the skills to please every person's ear. They were there 
to deliver the message in song, and if it wasn't well done, people will have a bad association. 
"Oh, those political folk songs! They're __pick your epithet__." Because she's a professional 
musician, Janet wants to make sure that it's well done. It's really got to be great before it hits 
the stage. She's a little bit of a snob in that she doesn't think that things that are not well done 
should hit the stage. She doesn't think that "something" is better than nothing. So how to get 
the next generations to hear the music? They've got to hear it well done. There's a ton of great 
material out there. It's not better to deliver it just any way at all. It's got to be good.  
 
If the Chorus hasn't mastered a particular song, she doesn't let it hit the stage. She's not 
interested in setting them up to "fail" or giving an audience a reason to dismiss the content or 
the format. Maybe it won't happen [that the Chorus will continue]. The next thing will happen.  
 
1:02:08.3 Those folks probably already have a version that Janet doesn't know about.  
 
1:02:16.9 DF: Anything else you want to tell me?   
 
1:02:27.3 [Janet asks again about the whole project, and Fant replies: The larger scope of this, 
"Washington Works," is an examination of the ways in which people in Washington make a

living, with a focus on union job. So Janet is a member of the musician's union, two locals, and 
the IWW, and she makes her living as a bookkeeper. This interview is probably going to be a bit 
different from most of the interviews because the other interviews that Fant has done have 
really explored the job that is part of being a union member, what's required of the job. And 
how one gets to the job if one goes through the different layers or levels to get to journeyman 
or get to flight attendant. And what the intricacies of the daily job are. This interview is 
different because Fant wanted to bring in the idea that not everyone is a member of a union 
because they have to join in order to do the job. This is more of a philosophical take on unions.]  
 
1:04:01.2 Janet would add one more thing. That is the role that the Seattle Labor Chorus plays 
in serving the union in the state. There definitely has been a transition. The Chorus used to, in 
its early days, sing anyplace that they could. If they could charge somebody for it, they'd get 
some money to support the organization. As they developed their skills, as they increased in 
number and representation from all the different workers there are in the community, and as 
they made an effort to let various organizations know that the Chorus was there to serve them, 
they began to have institutional support. Various unions and other organizations would make a 
contribution to the chorus just so it would continue to exist, whether or not they sang for the 
organization or not.  
 
The Chorus would show up on their picket lines and at their rallies to support them, whether it 
was the full chorus or the "flying squadron" with lyrics that they'd written to common tunes so 
they could raise their voices, so they could sustain them through their particular troubles and 
tribulations at that time. The Chorus showed up for them. The Chorus began to be aware that 
they were serving, and the organizations began to be aware that the Chorus was serving them 
too. There was a slow, mutual building of the Chorus being an organization that serves the 
greater Labor Movement. They can't serve the whole state because it would be too expensive 
for so many people to travel on a regular basis. But they have gone to the Great Labor Arts 
Exchange in Washington D.C. that celebrates labor every year. They've gone down to California 
to the Western Workers Labor Heritage Festival many times representing Washington State and 
the songs written here. They've done a number of concerts with Solidarity Notes, the 
Vancouver, B.C., labor chorus, and they've done actions at the Canadian Border, at the Peace 
Arch, with the two choruses singing together. They've done it on issues, particularly 
international labor treaties or economic treaties that disregard the welfare of the workers and 
the environment in each of their countries. They've gone to Canada and toured with the Labor 
Chorus, gone to Vancouver Island and done performances at local labor memorials and 
festivals. They serve a regional labor movement as well.  
 
And they've been able to do that because they are sustained by the organizations in their 
community. Whenever they can, they are there on the line. They've also been at some drink-
ins, helping the hotel and restaurant workers. To break out into song, and to have really 
pointed lyrics, well--that works! The other customers know that there is something going on! 
That is one more aspect of how the Chorus is part of Washington Works. They have supported 
us, and we support them. Hearing one's culture helps one be sustained through hard times. 
Also to know this has happened before, knowing the history of Labor struggle, which is what

the Chorus does through song, reminds people--it's a great backstitch. Not every gain stays, it 
keeps slipping back. But like a backstitch, when you go forward, then go back a quarter of an 
inch, then go a quarter of an inch forward, it makes a much stronger seam! That's how we're 
part of our community.  
 
DF: Thank you!
