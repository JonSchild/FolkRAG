I courted a fair maid

Ben RiceI Courted a Fair MaidAlternative title: The Beauty BrideI courted a fair maid, she was just a
brideAnd on her I placed my whole heart and life ? I courted her for love, and love I did gain,I never
gave her reason that she should complain.When her old, cruel parents came this for to know:That I
and their dauther had loved each other so,They locked her in a chamber, they treated her so fierce,I
never, oh never, can get sight of my dear.Away to the army I did go,To see if I could forget my love
or no.When I got there, six months I had to stayBefore that I could get leave to come away.When
I started home the evening shone so bright ?It put me fresh in mind of my whole heart's desire.I
met an old lady, she wrung her hands and cried,Saying, "My daughter she loves you and for your
sake she died."I fell in the door like a lamb that was slain,The tears from my eyes fell like showers
of rain.Crying, "Oh, Oh, this grief I cannot bear,My tru love truelove is in the grave and I long to be
there.[Third?] verse:Away to the [ widow window I did goTo see if I could get sight of her or noWhen I
got there, she made me this reply,"I will have the man that loves me, I'll love him till I die.*
