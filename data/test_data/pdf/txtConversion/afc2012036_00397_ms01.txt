Briana O’Higgins interviewing Steve Rooney, February 18, 2013 
 
Will you start with your name and your positions at Boeing and the Union? 
 
Steve Rooney, uh, originally hired in Boeing 1974, July. And I was a machinist there 
uh, until I went on a leave of absence full time to become a union representative in 
1992. Uh, I was elected the first shift plant representative, which covered only the 
Boeing site, and then in 1995 I was transferred to the district and uh, was a business 
representative and then in 1999 I became the assistant director and uh, in January 
2001 I became the president and director, which I held that position until June of 
2012. 
 
Are you from Wichita? 
 
I am. 
 
When you were growing up in Wichita, were you aware of Boeing? 
 
I certainly was, my dad went to work at Boeing, the second time, in 1950. As well as 
my grandfather worked at Boeing. 
 
Do you remember what you felt, or thought, about Boeing when you were growing 
up? 
 
Of course I always was impressed with the aircraft and some of the things that they 
did and some of the stories that, mainly my dad, told me.  
 
Were you like a kid who liked planes and aircraft and want to work there? 
 
I did. I did. 
 
Did anybody else in your family work there? 
 
Uh, my daughter worked there and was laid off several years ago, and went back to 
school and decided to do something different. And, my son in law currently works 
there. 
 
Did you go to college or university? 
 
No, I did not.  
 
How did you first get hired on to Boeing? 
 
Uh, I hired on in the machine shop, like I said, 1974. At that point they were doing 
what was called the B52 re wing where they put new wings on the B52s, uh, so it 
was booming. A lot of people working there. And, uh, I had high school experience in 
a machine shop, as well as I worked full time in a machine shop downtown to gain a 
few years experience that was required to hire in at Boeing at that time.  
 
So out of school you worked at the machine shop downtown with the intention of 
applying at Boeing? 
 
Yes.  
 
How long did it take for you to get hired? 
 
When I went out and filled out the application and got the interview, I was hired that 
day. 
 
Oh wow. What was your first job titled at Boeing, and kind of go through… 
 
First job was a milling machine operator, which I was only there about six months 
and transferred into the inseam machines, which is the numerical control machines.  
 
And then you went into the union? 
 
Yes.  
 
Um, did you like being a Boeing machinist? 
 
I did. Very good job, good pay good benefits uh, a lot of people there that were very 
friendly, and the prestige of building the parts that were on the aircraft. 
 
How did you get involved in the union? 
 
UH, one of the guys in the machine shop I worked with for several years went in to 
the position that I first went into as a plant representative and he got me involved 
and appointed to a few committees were I served the local lodge 834 at the time, 
and from there he was killed in a car wreck and somebody else that went in asked 
me to run for the job full time, and I did. Like I said, was elected to it in 1992.  
 
Were your dad or your grandfather involved in the union? 
 
Not like I was. They were both union members, but they weren’t involved like I was. 
 
What were your feelings when you were about to leave your position at Boeing and 
go full time and move into a union position? 
 
Uh, knowing that I was leaving there and would still be servicing all of the contract 
between the Boeing company and the machinists union, really representing all the 
members, I didn’t think a lot about it because contractually I had the right to return 
to Boeing if I weren’t reelected at any point in there. 
Did you ever go back to Boeing? 
 
No, I retired as soon as this election was over. 
 
 
Did Boeing provide training for you? 
 
No, they did not. Because I hired in and they required a minimum of two years 
experience on the machine before you transferred in.  
 
What did you like about, working in the union? 
 
When I was business representative and plant representative I had the task of 
representing and negotiating contracts or assisting in the negotiation for all the 
employees in all of the aircraft companies here in Wichita. Um, as plant rep I only 
represented and worked contractual issues for the people that were employed at 
Boeing and then as president and director my responsibilities were oversight of 
everything in the state of Kansas. 
 
Wow. 
 
Which includes other that just aircraft. 
 
Um, what were periods of strike like for you, were you on strike when you were a 
Boeing employee? 
 
The first time was 1977. 
 
Just three years later… Will you talk about all the periods of strike that you went 
through, starting with that one in 1977? 
 
Uh, 1977, I believe lasted like 42 days. Uh, it was an issue over grade sheets, um, 
which eventually got eliminated. The next one, like I said, it was tough for a lot of 
people. The next one was 1989, again, strikes are tough for anybody. We never go in 
to contract negotiations with the intent to negotiate a strike. Anybody can do that. 
We try to get an agreement, but obviously there are things that happen at different 
times that each party has to do what they need to do. But 89 was uh, a 49 day long 
strike, again, it was pretty rough on a lot of families…. 
 
What about your family? 
 
Uh, not really, because I was prepared for it. I had been married since ’72 and uh, I 
had a couple of kids. The only issue then was that I had to pay my medical insurance 
out of that in both ’77 and ’89. I can remember monthly premium in 1977 was $125. 
Haha. Uh, but eventually that was returned when the strike was settled and we 
reached an agreement. Then the next strike was 1995. Um, and that one was 69 days 
long. That one was a little more bitter, because things were really going good and 
everybody knew they were going good. But, pretty tough on everybody. I mean, a lot 
of people struggled during that one, I mean, 69 days off. It was coming right up to 
the holidays. Even right up to the Christmas holiday and people were nervous about 
what they were going to do with their families and the Christmas and stuff at home. 
Fortunately, we were able to resolve that one just uh, about 10 days before 
Christmas. 
 
Were you at the union at that time? 
 
I was I was a business representative.  
 
What did that mean for you? 
 
Uh, I still had responsibilities for other assignments in Wichita, but primarily I was 
over at the local lodge where the members were on strike, trying to provide them 
any assistance that we could. We tried to find jobs. We had people set up through 
quality training, and we were helping them with resume writing and part time jobs, 
some jobs may take them out of state and stuff. But, for people who really wanted to 
go to work we were pretty successful to place them. 
 
What made you want to… Am I missing a step, when you were a business 
representative then what came after that? 
 
Assistant director. 
 
And is that an elected position? 
 
No, that is an appointed position by the president and director and it was Richard 
Ulrich. Uh, he later, again as well, was killed in a car wreck. But I had known Richard 
a long time and uh, we went through a lot together and he appointed me as his 
assistant and then in that roll as assistant anytime anyone is unable to fulfill that 
then you move up to director, which is how I got put in the position as director the 
first time in 2001.  
 
That is when he passed away… 
 
Yes. 
 
What was being president like for you? You did it a long time. 
 
A long time. Uh, its tough, very tough. Long hours, a lot of travel, uh, lot of time away 
from your family. But it’s the thanks that you get when people do appreciate what 
you did. Uh, getting contracts negotiated that are good contracts. And uh, the thanks 
you get when you get somebody back to work on a job or help them out, or get them 
referred to people, like Mario Cervantes and stuff through United Way. Um, there is 
a lot of thanks in that job that people give you. 
 
How did your job as president of the union make you look at machinists and what 
you had done for Boeing differently? Did it make you look at that job differently? 
 
I don’t think so, pretty much the same. 
 
Did you work on the commercial side of Boeing or the military? 
 
I worked on the commercial side, but over the years uh, Boeing changed their name 
quite often. It was Boeing commercial, then it went to Boeing military, we done a lot 
of military work but never over on what is now the mod side, which is all military. 
So they have changed their name back and forth, Boeing airplane, Boeing 
Commercial Airplane Company. During my time there and before there has been a 
lot of name changes at the company.  
 
What was 2007 like, the split.  
 
It was 2005, June of 2005. It was really tough, really rough. When Onex bought them 
a lot of people didn’t get job offers to go work for the new company. A lot of long 
term people, which was very tough. I mean that hit home. It tore at your heart to see 
people that had been there that long that didn’t get offers in the company that they 
had worked for for many years, and then people felt like because they didn’t get a 
job offer at Boeing and they had to place that on a resume, where they worked, that 
they were titled slugs and other things and didn’t perform the job. That was not 
true. The people that were employed in 2005 were the very same people that 
worked at Boeing in 1996 when they delivered a record number of aircraft, the first 
time that Boeing had every delivered 600+ aircraft in a single year. So, its hard to 
convince me that those people didn’t know their jobs, I am not going to sit here and 
try to convince you that some weren’t the best, but they knew what their job was 
and they did it well.  
 
You think Boeing used that time to clean house? 
 
Onex did.  It wasn’t Boeing, Onex did.  
 
Um, let’s see here, were there differences between members of the different aircraft 
manufacturers when you were serving all the different factions of aircraft workers? 
Was there a lot of difference? 
 
No, pretty much the same. You have guidelines of a labor agreement that has been 
negotiated between both parties, its not just us. We don’t just put our name on it and 
sign it, it is an agreement between both parties, both parties have responsibility to 
ensure that it is being administered. So, it didn’t matter where they came from, and 
not just aircraft. I know that some of the smaller places felt like they weren’t as 
important as the Boeing’s and Spirits and some of the other companies, but they 
were.  
 
It’s a vastly different skill set that you would use on the floor as a machinist at 
Boeing and negotiating contracts as a union president, how did you learn along the 
way to do what you did for the unions?  
 
Uh, a lot of it on the job. Again, my first time full time was with the local lodge plant 
representative and I had the responsibility for that contact, and I was dedicated to it. 
I learned it. Often people was impressed that I could go through and quote contract 
word for word and, not all of it, but the majority of any of it without ever picking up 
the book. 
 
Why is a union important for companies like Boeing? 
 
Again, uh, fair wages, not asking anybody to get rich, but fair wages, fair benefits, we 
want people to give an honest days work for an honest days way. Um, I think 
without it, without the union the biggest thing I see is, we all was we age slow down 
with the natural aging process or been in a job a long time– injuries, carpal tunnel 
ect. And if we didn’t have that protection there I believe when we started reaching 
that age we would be sent down the road and that is one of the biggest protections 
that we have, the seniority. 
 
How did you see unions changing over, since you started in aircraft in the 70s? 
 
Uh, the biggest change that I seen in what we did and things that happened, we went 
in and negotiated for wages and benefits during the 70s and 80s. In the early 90s uh, 
when NAFTA was passed we changed completely where our members wanted to see 
job security. I seen drastic reduction in numbers of employees at Boeing, uh after 
that. I mean, I can tell you that the hourly workforce that I represented through my 
tenure there, uh, we were looking at 10, 12 thousand hourly employees, not 
counting engineers or salaries or any of that. Uh, and that dropped considerably in 
probably 1999 and went down to around 6,000. So almost cut in half, so we then 
had to take on the roll of trying to negotiate language that protected people’s jobs, 
give them an opportunity to train to do something else if their job was being 
eliminated because I believe truly that the American people want to work. Uh, and 
do a good job at what they do. 
 
Did Boeing look out for the Wichita community? 
 
They did. Um, Boeing always participated in multiple programs, the good neighbor 
fund probably being the largest, but there was always contributions made to Boeing 
from other uh, community events around town that the employees all wanted to 
take part in and do. I mean it was a big push for coats and blankets, food drives and 
everything else that Boeing and the employees always got involved in. 
 
Do you remember what you were doing when you heard that Boeing was going to 
completely close their Wichita operations? 
 
I was in Seattle at the time. And was informed that uh, … I’m sorry I was in Chicago 
at their headquarters and we heard rumor that Wichita uh, was going to close its 
doors. And so from that point uh, when I was there we moved from there to Seattle 
and then we started a negotiations process uh, knowing that it was the possibility. 
Boeing wanted to get an extended agreement out of everybody, including Seattle. 
Which we did, they did end up getting that extension. And, they were reluctant to 
talk about Wichita, and then they finally said, um, the future of Wichita is not 
certain. You will get this work and this work, if the doors stay open. 
 
That was in the contract? 
 
No, that was when they told us that when we were up there negotiating for an 
extension for the agreement that is currently in effect. We wanted to believe, and we 
all did, and the employees there wanted to believe that it was going to stay open. 
Because it wasn’t the first time it was looked at for the potential of closing the 
Wichita site. And we thought with what the military employees have the Air Force 
One programs, the clearances that a number of employees – 180 some employees 
had to have just to work on it, and then people have to be escorted by somebody 
that has that clearance, that there was nowhere they were going to find the number 
of employees qualified to work on it that could pass those clearances, because they 
are very tough. So we all wanted to believe that it was going to remain open.  
 
Were you surprised? 
 
I was surprised. Very surprised that they decided they were shutting the doors. 
 
What do you think it means for the Wichita community with Boeing closing up shop 
this year? 
 
I think Wichita, uh, state of Kansas, is going to see a large loss by Boeing closing their 
doors. Um, the aircraft I think will always be around here, um, Spirit in some sense is 
still Boeing, I mean they build the 737s and stuff like that, but it is not Boeing. I am 
not saying anything against Spirit, they are a good company. Boeing was the big 
name around the world. Uh, and so that’s not going to be there anymore. Not for 
Wichita. They will still be  here in Seattle and other areas, but for Wichita… no one is 
the air capital of the world. I’ve always wondered …. Being known as it, will it some 
day be … a Flint, Michigan where we don’t have that air craft here like we do. 
Because we are seeing a lot of jobs outsourced, shipped overseas and other places. 
 
I am jumping around here, but when you left the union post, as president in 2012 
last year, were you ready to go? 
 
Uh, no. I wasn’t, but it is the election process and I think the long term agreement 
that we had negotiated with the uh, Spirit Areosystems is what caused it. A lot of 
people were unhappy with that, but I am not going to apologize for it. Uh, I know 
what Boeing expects out of Spirit and they are a supplier now, they are no longer the 
company that Boeing was. And uh, I did it for job security and I think it has shown, 
not only that it is stable. It has grown.  
 
Were you, did you feel loyal to the Boeing Company while you worked there? 
 
I did. Every company, even in my job as the president. If it weren’t for the companies 
we wouldn’t be here anyway, so I had an obligation to every company to keep those 
companies afloat as well as this membership and doing my job to represent them. 
 
Are you still technically on leave from Boeing? 
 
No. I took a voluntary layoff. I could’ve went back to the plant with my seniority, but 
I would have, that would have meant somebody else going out the door. I was more 
prepared for it, so I took the voluntary layoff and I will be officially retired March 1.  
 
Wow. When did you take the layoff then? 
 
Uh, August 31. 
 
Interesting. I imagine you have friends, co–workers, ex co–workers out at the 
plant… 
 
I still do, and I often get calls asking me questions. 
 
What are some of them going to do after it closes? 
 
There are already some that have made the decision to take permanent transfers to 
Seattle area. Uh, there are some that’s taking some job offers in Oklahoma. Uh, I 
really haven’t heard of any of them that want to go down to the facility in San 
Antonio, which I think the Boeing Company banked on a lot. It’s not that far to go, 
and everybody I have talked to is not interested in going to San Antonio Texas. And I 
think that there may be some of them made offers to uh go work for Spirit 
Aerosystesms. 
 
What would you like to see happen to the Boeing facility here in Wichita? 
 
Well my first would be that it remain open and keep going as it is. I don’t see that 
because the cost is associated with uh, all the overhead they have with it. So my, the 
second thing I would like to see happen would be uh, Spirit Aerosystems buy it and 
use that facility as expansion, because they already lease one of the hangars from 
them where they perform the work on the 787. 
 
Are you still involved in union activities? 
 
Very little, very little.  
 
Do you think there is a chance that they keep any of the programs here, like Air 
Force One? 
 
I think now it would be only if Onex or Spirit bought them. 
 
Oh… 
 
If they price were right, they may be interested. I wouldn’t tell you they wouldn’t. 
But I am not the guy to make those decisions anymore. 
 
Can we talk about your job as the president a little bit more? What was the most 
frustrating part of that job for you? 
 
… …. Probably I am going to say my whole time the most depressing and frustrating 
thing that I seen happen again was the sell of Boeing to Onex, and there were 
thousands of people that did not get job offers. Not just many of my own union 
brothers and sisters, by biological brothers. Very tough to see the good employees 
go out the door. And I still see a lot of them from time to time, and the jobs that they 
have taken are jobs to keep them busy and support, try to support a family. Because 
they still were, and I believe that, were blackballed from a lot of the other companies 
thinking that they let them go because they weren’t good employees.  
 
Um, the those layoffs that happened by delivery truck on that Saturday.. 
 
Yes. 
 
That was not Boeing? 
 
No that was not Boeing, that was Onex. 
 
Does Boeing get the wrap for that? because I feel like I hear the finger being pointed 
at Boeing for those layoffs. 
 
You know I hadn’t heard that. uh, and I really didn’t think they were. The biggest 
problem that I heard from that was one, people didn’t think that Boeing would ever 
sell. Not the Wichita facility. A lot of tours from people all over the country to 
Wichita, they all talked about how productive the employees were here, um, and 
didn’t ever believe it would happen. So, I haven’t heard that it was Boeing that got 
the blame for the letters. Except in a round about way, management that worked for 
Boeing uh, we believe, all of us believe, in rumor, even by some of the managers that 
didn’t get offers, is they had input about who got job offers and who didn’t.  
 
Oh OK. Why do you think Boeing is leaving Wichita? 
 
Again, the biggest issue I have ever heard is the cost. They still have a very large 
facility out there, very little work to come in here. And now that they are military 
and they are military only, uh, there is not that much work coming in here, and it is 
not enough to keep the place going and to keep it busy. I believe one of the bigger 
mistakes that was made, aside of the selling of the facility and now closure of the 
Wichita facility was the decision that was made to get out of the commercial mod 
business and go just strictly military. Uh, over the years they went all over the world 
bringing in Boeing airplanes in here to upgrade them and do renovation on them 
under the commercial umbrella. And that stopped when they decided to go military 
only.  
 
Do you think there will be any long term impact on Wichita with Boeing’s 
departure? 
 
That’s really tough to answer. There is still a lot of people and I think you’re looking 
at… I don’t believe everybody that works here today will get a job offer at the other 
companies, or in Seattle or Oklahoma city or San Antonio. So, you are going to see 
unemployment from those that are here. Again, with Spirit still building a Boeing 
product, um, is going to help, I believe, with that impact. Uh, again, there is no 
question that we are loosing employees. Um, I can remember, not long ago, prior to 
2001, 9–11, Wichita in the hourly workforce was around 23,000 people. Today that 
is under 16,000, so that is a large number of people that’s unemployed in the aircraft 
business here in Wichita. But, uh, its not going to just hurt Wichita with Boeing’s 
decision here. I think it could make some changes. Boeing also outsources a lot of 
work to what is referred to as the mom and pop shops; small machine shops and 
plants around and in outlying communities around here. Uh, and I think we still see 
some of those jobs lost as well.  
 
(Filmmaker) why does Onex hate Wichita so much? 
 
Onex is an investment firm and they buy businesses to turn them for a profit. That 
hasn’t always been the case. There is still companies that they bought years ago that 
they still own, and they grow a lot of them. And they have grown Spirit compared to 
what it was. They brought in additional work, so it is more stable for the people that 
are there. Uh, um, people feel that it is anti Onex, or it is anti Spirit because they did 
the cuts. Uh, but if you are in the aircraft business, there is no question that Spirit 
Aerosystems is still the highest paid and the best benefits of any of the other aircraft 
companies in Wichita. 
 
Even Boeing? 
 
Not Boeing, any of them that are left.
