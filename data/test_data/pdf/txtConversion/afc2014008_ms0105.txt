Dear Dr. Sun:
 
I am sorry it has taken me so long to write and express to you and
 
all my friends at the Chinese Culture Foundation how delighted I
 
was with the Chinese presentation at the 1975 Festival of American
 
Folklife.  The crafts, the cooking, the games and the shadow play
 
were all both impressive and delightful; and I am sure all the
 
festival visitors went away with a new interest in, and a new
 
appreciation for the culture of the Chinese people.
 
As you probably know, I have stayed behind in Washington to work
 
on next year's Festival.  I have a rather impressive title --
Deputy Director for Presentation -- but it does mean that I shall
 
be able to see to it that the magnificent contributions of the
 
Chinese people to life in the United States receive additional
 
recognition during the 1976 Festival.  I shall look forward to
 
hearing any suggestions you may have as to how that might most
 
appropriately be done.
 
I am still struggling with the traditional structure of the Festival;
 
like all traditions, it works very well for some things and not
 
at all successfully for others.  It appears that again Regional
 
America will be the most likely place for performances of Chinese
 
culture, but we can always hope at least for more geographical
 
variety, adding presentations from the east coast to those of
 
the west.  If you have any suggestions as to a suitable group
 
that we could contact in the New York area, I
'd appreciate your
 
letting me know.
 
Again, let me express my gratitude and appreciation for all the
 
effort you and the other Center members put in to making the
 
Festival the outstanding suggess it was.  I hope everyone came
 
away feeling properly appreciated and properly successful.  It
 
was one of the high points of the entire program.
 
With my very best wishes for a successful year for all my friends
 
at the Chinese Culture Center, I am
 
Yours very sincerely,
 
Bess Lomax Hawes
 
P
.S.  By the way, in terms of our Working America program, have you
 
been able to undertake any of the research we were discussing on the
 
Chinese railroad workers?

Dear Joyce:
 
I write belatedly to express my very deep appreciation of your
 
work both before and during the California presentation in the
 
Regional section of the 1975 Smithsonian Festival of American
 
Folklife.

l 
Your preliminary field work covered the San Francisco area with
 
extraordinary depth and range.  I know of few other people who
 
could have looked into as many varied levels of traditional
 
expression as you managed in such a short time.  The final
 
presentation on the mall in Washington must have given you
 
real satisfaction; your Assyrians were among the more outstanding
 
performers in the entire festival I think.  The two Greek gentlemen
 
were joys, and two of their completed beehives are now gracing
 
the bookcase outside my office.
 
Finally, your program organization and presentational style
 
were models.
 I think no other of the California field workers
 
managed to provide the listening audiences with the depth of
 
scholarly commentary you gave each time.
 
I sincerely hope to be able to have the pleasure of working with
 
you again.  My thanks and admiration go with this letter.
 
Yours very truly,
 
Bess Lomax Hawes

Dear Dan:
 
I write to express my personal appreciation for your work as
 
field investigator, researcher, and program organizer for
 
the California presentation at the 1975 Festival of American
 
Folklif
 e
.
 
It is unfortunately quite rare to find someone with your energy,
 
resourcefulness, commitment, and informed expertise.  All the
 
Spanish-speaking members of our group enjoyed your company
 
and appreciated your fluency in their native language; I appreciated
 
the efficiency with which you organized their musical programs
 
and the depth of informational content you provided.  I have
 
felt for a long t
ime that at least some exposure to ethnomusicology
 
should be a part of everyone's education, producing more
 
sophisticated and more humane world citizens; now I am sure of it.
 
In the enlarged Festival currently being planned for the summer
 
of 1976, the Smithsonian is considering devoting an entire week
 
to an Hispanic presentation.  We very much hope bhat you will be
 
able to participate again in this endeavor, and we will be
 
writing you during the next month to initiate a discussion of
 
what part you might be willing to play.
 
Very sincerely yours,
 
Bess Lomax Hawes

Dear Mike:
 
I apologize for taking so long to express my own personal
 
appreciation of your work for the California Presentation
 
at the 1975 Festival of American Folklife.  During both the
 
pre-Festival field work period and the time you functioned
 
as program organizer and commentator on the mall, you showed
 
exemplary care and concern for the twin objectives of the
 
Festival: to show the American people the depth and beauty
 
of their own folk arts, and to honor and support the traditional
 
artists who shared their lives with us on the mall.
 
V
 
I particularly appreciated your energy and application during
 
the exhausting field work period prior to the Festival, the
 
commitment you showed to scholarship during your presentations,
 
and the personal devotion with which you cased for the performers'
 
needs during the Festival.  I hope that you will be able to
 
f
 i
rd tirac this coming summer to help us with the 1976 Festival;
 
we will need many people of your calibre.
 
Yours very sincerely,

Dear Justin:
 
I write to convey my formal thanks and appreciation for your
 
work as a field research and program organizer at the
 
California presentation in the Regional America section of
 
the 1975 Smithsonian Festival of American Folklife.  Without
 
the efforts of many such devoted and talented people as
 
yourself, the presentation could never have come off as
 
splendidly as it did, and we are all grateful for the vital
 
part you played.
 
You field work was responsible and energetic; your presentations
 
were selfless and informative; your relationship with the
 
performers was positive and friendly.  It was a real pleasure
 
to work with you, and I send my very best wishes to you in
 
all your future endeavors.
 
Sincerely yours,
 
Bess Lomax Hawes

Supply  and Program
 
DATE:  July 1
, 1976
 
1
)  Recently I became aware of two situations in Regional Americans in which
 
it is apparent that supply procedure for participants is drastically and ad-
versely affecting program in such a way that we are certainly guil ty of being
 
penny-wise and pound-foolish. My awareness of the situations came about because
 
in each case I had done the fieldwork for the particular craft involved and was
 
informed of the problems by the participants who turned to me.
 
2
) The wild-rice parching
/winnowing demonstration for Great Lakes week re-
quired us to obtain rice in a state of condition called "
seed rice" because
 
ordinarily rice is not harvested until late su mer. I had located in  Wisconsin
 
the only two places where this might be available and passed the information
 
along to Bob Munson, supply coordinator for Regional. Bob spent a good bit of
 
time on the phone getting the arrangements made with a man in Spooner Wisconsin
 
who would go out onto the lakes, harvest the seed rice, dry it in his garage
 
and ship it  to us in time for the demonstration. Apparently Bob's function
 
was usurped by someone (
Art?) higher than h
im who insisted he would do the
 
ordering. My understanding is that this person then informed Regional that
 
the order was in and ready about three weeks before it was needed. When the
 
three Indians arrived, however, it turned out that the rice had never been
 
ordered. Consequently they sat idle for two of the five days while an emergency
 
order was placed with the original man in Spooner. Because it had to be gathered
 
in a hurry, it was wet upon arrival and had to be specially heated for about
 
half a day over a fire.
 
3
) The Great Lakes smelt-fry foodways demonstration was similarly worked out
 
between Bob Munson and myself. I had made initial arrangements with Bodin Fisheries
 
i
n Bayfield Wisconsin to save enough for us to freeze and ship. Bob discussed
 
all this with them and they awaited our order. The  smelt run at a certain time
 
in May and they don't keep them on hand, so it was important to specify our order
 
in time. Once again, however, the supply man usurped Bob's function and insisted
 
on doing the ordering himself. It was not until the end of the Festival that the
 
two ladies doing the cooking informed me that they had been given salt-water
  
smelt--an entirely different fish. Furthermore, all the smelt ordered were al-
ready cleaned, when we had planned programmatically to have some whole smelt
 
for the ladies t
o demonstrate the full cleaning, dipping, cooking process. The
 
whole smelt had been put aside for us by Bodin Fisheries, which is an unusual
 
request but one which we felt would enhance the demonstration. Nothing had been
 
said during the Festival because the two ladies involved were too embarrassAed
 
to mention
, it and simply didn't wish to seem complaining,
 
t
.
 
4
) It seems to me that the National Museum should be expected to provide partici-
pants with exactly what they are used to working with; otherwise we are wasting
 
a good deal of fieldwork money and causing embarrassment all around.

In Europe, quilting was a boon to Europ eans raising the standard of

Meanwhile, Colonial women developed American quilting from Averican
