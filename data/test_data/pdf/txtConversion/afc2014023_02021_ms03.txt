gestures to the skirt of his jacket, explaining that the “layers” of a well-built garment are 
not “fused” (either with glue or heat) but laid up carefully so that they move independently 
to create, or allow, a better “drape.”

MARTINEZ CUSTON CLOTHING/MANUAL MARTINEZ, OWNER-DESIGNER – In order to 
service most clients, its necessary to keep on hand a wide range of colorful and strong 
thread, not only for the construction of original garments but in order to usefully 
accommodate the occasional special requests of clients for alterations and/or repairs of 
other wardrobe items – work carried out often in order to build good will.

or “U” shaped thread cutters, in addition to single-edge razor blades.
