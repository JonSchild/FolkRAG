DAN TUCKER
Old Dan Tucker was down in town Swinging those ladies round and round First to the
right and then to the left Then to the one that he loved best. Get out of the way for old
Dan Tucker Came too late to get his supper Supper is over and breakfast cooking Left old
Daniel standing and looking, Get out of the way for old Dan Tucker Come too late to get
his supper.
