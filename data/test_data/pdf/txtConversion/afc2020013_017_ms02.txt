[0:45]  
Origin of Pedro Motors and Relationship with the Ransomville Speedway 
 
Discussion of relationship between Pedro Motors, the Ransomville Speedway, 
and the Ransomville Slowpokes: the original track was founded in part by Ed 
Oritz (Pedro’s son) behind then Pedro Motors  
 
Formal meetings of the Slowpokes happened mostly at the Porter Hotel, but 
meetings and hanging out at Pedro Motors as well – and working on the cars 
there 
 
Pedro Motors built in 1946, originally Pedro was selling used cars out of the 
garage behind the family house (few doors down) 
 
Pedro Motors built on what was called ‘The Strawberry Patch’, and later also 
built one in the Falls and one in Lockport – used cars were Kaiser Willys 
 
Pedro Motors was a used car dealership and garage too, kind of a general repair 
place, collision, overhaul, anything needed doing 
 
Pedro was more of a businessman, not a mechanic – Jipp said his grandfather 
(Rick’s dad) was a ‘suit and tie guy’ 
 
[6:20] 
Early Memory of Pedro Motors & Ed’s Garage 
 
Relating to race track it was a hangout place, but Rick shares he started helping 
out at the garage cleaning cars and also some other stuff 
 
Ed Ortiz (Jipp’s dad) basically grew up in the garage and learned just absorbing 
from the guy’s in the shop – including from guys like Cubby, and Al Bonkowski 
(sp?) 
 
Jipp shares a joke and story of his dad’s reputation in repairing and fixing things 
as a mechanic – that he could basically fix anything or cobble stuff together and 
somehow get you home if your car broke down 
 
Jipp contrasts that he feels his dad (Ed) was a brilliant mechanic but not great 
businessman, and his grandfather was the opposite: a great businessman but not 
a great mechanic 
 
After Pedro passed away in 1958, is when it changed over the next few years to 
Ed’s Garage: Jipp sharing that his dad didn’t really focus on / want the business 
side of it re: selling used cars, just wanted to focus on fixing cars 
 
Rick & Ed going into selling snowmobiles too, which was doing well until the 
gas crunch of the 1970s (and Rick leaving for Rochester), and it became very 
tough time for the Ortiz family 
 
[13:00] 
Ed’s Garage continued 
 
Rick stopped working primarily at Ed’s Garage in 1967 as was having trouble 
making ends meet in terms of what he wanted to do, went over to Allstate as an 
automobile adjuster 
 
Ed continued to work the snowmobiling and Ed’s Garage 
 
Ed’s Garage continues to be kind of a congregating spot for folks in the 
community still, Jipp not remembering there being any changes on the shop side 
re:  
 
Jipp shares how with his dad racing and owning Ed’s Garage, he didn’t really 
sleep or balance anything – just worked a million hours: either on the race cars or 
at the garage 
 
Rick shares his memory that he was usually the one driving to the races at that 
time, and Ed would be asleep in the passenger seat: Jipp sharing amazement at 
amount of travel put on those cars then to race and then be able to come back 
always and work that full day 
 
Rick shares another memory of how that ‘balancing’ worked, just working all 
day, racing and coming back late after driving for so long, then coming back and 
needing to put cows in the pasture back before bed 
 
[17:15] 
Changes in Ed’s Garage & Jipp’s Skills  
 
Jipp and Rick discuss the lack of equipment changes at Ed’s Garage  
 
Rick shares memory of another time of economic struggle, but with his father 
(Pedro) re: Pedro Motors selling used cars in a difficult market 
 
Jipp learning all of his skills in fabrication and everything through mechanics at 
Ed’s Garage – never went to trade school 
 
Jipp shares a contrast in some other mechanics replacing things, where his dad 
always emphasized fixing things somehow first 
 
Talking about how lack of equipment upgrades or changes reflected the not 
strong business sense of his dad: i.e. spending extra money to be more efficient 
 
 
[20:50] 
Ed’s Garage Business Practices in Early Day 
Rick recalling that Ed’s “hi heart was too big for being a good businessman” – 
that sometimes he’d only charge 10% of a job to someone if worried they 
couldn’t pay 
 
Rick sharing a memory of fabricating an entire exhaust system on a car, taking 
almost 6-8 hours, and Ed only charged her $20  
 
Jipp sharing a frustration that he always had with his dad over that same 
problem, of undercharging and shortchanging themselves, which would lead to 
economic hardship on themselves and their families 
 
Rick continuing to reflect on that too, that he always talked to his older brother 
(Ed) about that – that they had to start getting people to pay a fair price instead 
of always undercutting themselves 
 
Rick talking about a memory of someone who never paid their bills, seeing their 
car at Batavia Downs, and Ed not wanting to pursue it farther: that Ed ‘loved 
people to a fault’ 
 
Jipp learning to build from his Dad, and description of his dad’s learning process 
and teaching side: and Jipp loving the fabrication side, and fixing things up 
 
Jipp sharing the stress that his Dad was going through 
 
[27:10] 
Jipp Taking Over Ed’s Garage 
 
Jipp talks about working for farmer’s and stuff at night too, but also working 
always at Ed’s Garage around the shop, and moved out west 
 
Jipp talks about how he came back when his dad turned the garage over to him 
and let him run it: and that his dad would work under him, although he also 
went to go work for the bus garage in the area with his good friend Paul Schultz 
 
Jipp shares about when he came back the amount of cleaning he did at Ed’s 
Garage, and his dad being a bit of a ‘packrat’: and a story about how his dad 
always tried to save everything, which he attributes to being when you go 
through tough times it is hard to throw things out 
 
Jipp talks about the changes and improvements they did on Ed’s Garage, and 
starting out with the used cars and collision, then just moving into collision 
(which continue to be known to this day) and now rust prevention and control 
 
[32:50] 
Racing Career – Jipp Ortiz 
 
Jipp revisiting the story of how he raced for the first time, and getting that bug 
and thinking that his dad was so successful and known for it, and he liked to 
build things, so he built it and raced  
 
Jipp shares that he feels with racing too, maybe subliminally that he spent the 
racing career just proving to his dad that he could ‘do it’ – as his dad wasn’t an 
‘encourager’ 
 
Jipp reflects on how racing can be kind of a selfish sport, that even though he 
always tried to be there for every game and that – but that it was unfair on his 
wife and family really, looking back at it: talking about how if you want to be 
good on something, someone has to make a sacrifice 
 
Rick jumps in and shares too that he agrees racing can be difficult for a family, 
and that he feels too his home life and wife also sacrificed to some extent 
 
Jipp shares about the pressure of being successful racing as his dad was so 
successful through a story of spinning out while leading a heat race 
 
Rick shares a story about Jipp’s dad/his brother Ed disciplining him snowing 
snowballs at cars 
 
[38:35] 
Ransomville Speedway & Ed’s Garage – Current Relationship 
 
Jipp talking about being a racing fan being his ‘circle of influence’ – the racetrack 
people are his people, and growing up that was all he ever did  
 
Rick reflects on how the racing community is very ‘real’ – there’s no false fronts 
in general, you know what you get / how people are right away 
 
Jipp sharing how whenever he goes to the track and brings people from church, 
that they’re surprised at how tightknit the community is and how it seems like 
he does kind of know almost everyone there now 
 
Jipp recalling how he started being a starter at Lancaster 
 
[41:45] 
Closing Thoughts – Ortiz Family Connection to Ransomville Speedway 
 
Rick talks about how it’s such a community, that if someone ever needs help: and 
that Jipp’s fabrication wasn’t only functional, but also ‘pretty’, and that’s what 
Jipp was known for 
 
Jipp sharing his time building a lot of cars starting in the 1998/9 
 
Jipp sharing his pride in having a 3rd Generation garage still going, and looking 
forward to seeing his grandfather and father – and looking to Justin Clark and 
supporting him, and hoping that his grandkids one day can continue to work at 
the garage and work under Justin  
 
Jipp talking about how as he’s gotten older, he’s been thinking more about the 
past, and how working on the land outback behind the garage, knows that his 
grandfather worked that land, and his legacy on this specific plot of land: that 
the racing and success and that kind of stuff, that the trophies hang and can 
remember them, but they weren’t ‘his dad’. And wanting to be remembered for 
more than just racing – to keep the Ortiz name going 
 
[46:00] 
Bible Study & Christian Mission Connection to Ed’s Garage & Pedro Motors 
 
Rick shares how aside from the garage side of things, the other main legacy of 
Pedro Motors and his/Ed’s dad Pedro was Christian heritage 
Since Pedro Motors was first founded in 1946, there’s always been some kind of 
church service or bible study taking place there – so in 2021, almost 75 years of 
this focus on Christian mission at the garage 
Rick talking about how Jipp’s dad Ed lived that Christlike life in the sense of 
always putting other people before himself and his family 
Jipp shares about how Pedro (his grandfather) was originally a Pastor from 
Puerto Rico, who then helped fundraise and build churches in Puerto Rico as 
well 
Jipp shares that being born into the Ortiz family, it wasn’t just about race cars 
and learning to drive, it was also that adherence to religion & the Christian faith 
Rick sharing that in contrast with Jipp, he did rebel in his early life, but later on 
became closer to and paid more attention to Christianity
