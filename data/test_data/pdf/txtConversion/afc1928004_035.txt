But rather for right and ould Ireland's sake, 
Tile Boy of Glengall will make tyrants quake. 
Tile maids of dear Erin, God bless them, and all 
Their prayers, Mollie, ask for the Boy of Glengall. 
Then Farewell, my Mary, oh, yes, we must part,

Loved Mary avorneen, I 
now have left thee, 
To make dear ould Ireland a 
land of the free; 
Here's that we may live to hear the words said: 
"Ould Ireland's Green nOw waves o'er the Red." 
The harp of ould Erin, her strings shall renew 
The Ever Green' Flag, and the Red White and Blue! 
Must wave to all nations, from mast, staff and tree, 
As emblems of nations who boast to be fr2e.

Here ye not ould Erin's Harp? 
'Tis sounding in the air; 
It bids ye for ould Ireland 
Your faithful vows declare; 
It bids ye bear her colors, 
Her noble sons and true, 
A 
prouder title would ye have, 
Than " Ireland's freed by you!" 
For every son and daughter 
That boasts of Irish blood, 
Shall hear across the water, 
" 
They helped us as they should.' 
And every man and woman 
Who helps—shall hear it said: 
" 
They have as well as others placed 
The Green above the Red 1" ,

And of our country dear,

"Och, Cupid is a 
native God, and Erin is his 
mother; 
And Ireland is his own abode; he never had 
another; 
In Blarney's groves the boy was born, and butter-
milk his pap was, 
Until on whiskey he was fed, which rather a 
mis-
hap was; 
For it made him so warm and bold, that still, and 
'tis no wonder; 
All great and small, and young and old, to Irish 
love knock under 
Och, love's an Irishman's employ, and at it, he's a 
. genius! 
For Cupid is an Irish boy; each Irish girl's a 
Venus. 
"Love's a 
shillelah, for his dart from which there's 
no retreating; 
For, tender to make every heart, he gives them all 
a 
beating; 
St. Patrick, his Godfather was, who said " You 
Young Phillistine" 
To Irishmen, give love for ten; an' then you'll be a 
christian;

For Irish hearts, are twice as large as any other 
nations, 
They,ve always room, whin strangers come, besides 
their blood relations 
Och, love's an Irishman's employ, an' at it, he's a 
genius! 
For Cupid is an Irish boy; each Irish girl's a 
Venus. 
"Love's blind, and bare, Mal you may swear, and 
lives upon potatoes, 
Why he is so, if you would know, why faith, I'll 
tell ye gratis; 
Love made each Irish boy so bright, they- soon 
found beauty's prize out, 
For which, poor urchin, out of spite, the heathens 
tore his eyes out. 
And to be sure he'd never roam, and so deserve our 
loathing, 
And keep love with us still at home, we took away 
his clothing. 
Och, love's an Irishman's employ, an' at it, he's a 
genius! 
For Cupid is an Irish boy: each Irish girl's a 
Venus."

As soon as the Boys wor all scattered and bate, 
'Twas the custom, whenever a

To hang him by trial---barrin' seeli as was shot. 
There was trial by jury goin' on by day-light, 
And the martial law liangin' the lavings by night.

It's them was hard times for an honest gossoon, 
If he missed the judges he'd meet a 
dragoon. 
An' whether the sojers or judges gave sentence, 
The divil a 
much time they allowed for repentance; 
An' the many a 
fine boy was then on his kapin', 
With small share of restin' or sittin' or sleepin'. 
An' because they loved Erinn, and scorned to sell it, 
A 
prey for the bloodhound, a 
mark for the bullit— 
Unsheltered by night and unrested by day, 
With the heath for their barrack, revenge for their 
pay. 
An' the bravest an' lionestest Boy of thim all 
Was Shamus O'Brien, from the town of Glingall; 
his limbs Wor well set, an' his body was light„ 
An' the keen-fanged hound had not teeth half as 
white. 
But his face was as pale as the face of the dead, 
An' his cheek never warm'd with the blush of the 
red; 
An' for all that he was'nt an ugly young Boy, 
For the divil himself could'nt blaze with his eye. 
So droll an' so wicked, so dark an' so bright, 
Like a 
fire flash that crosses the depth of the night; 
An' he was the best mower that ever has been, „ 
An' the elegantest hurler that ever was seen. 
In fencin' he gave Patrick Mooney a 
cut, 
An' in jtunpin' be bate Tom Molony a 
foot; 
For lightness of foot there was not his peer, 
For, by Heaven! he almost outrun the red deer; 
An' his dancin' was such that the men used to stare, 
An' the women turn crazy, he did it so square; 
An' sure the whole world gave in to him there!

o :Shamus O'Brien kSori
gster. 
An' it's he was the Boy that was hard to be caught, 
A' it's often he ran, an' it's often he fought, 
An it's many the one can remember quite well 
The quare things he did, an it's oft I 
heered tell 
How he frightened the magistrates in Ca.hirbally, 
An' escaped through the sojers in Aherlo valley, 
An' leathered the yeomen, himself agen four, 
An stretched the four strongest on old Galtimore. 
But the fox must sleep sometimes, the wild deer 
must rest, 
An' treachery prey on the blood of the best; 
An' many an action of power an' of pride, 
An' many a 
night on the mountain's bleak side, 
An' a 
thousand great dankers an' toils overpast, 
In darkness of night he was taken at last. 
Now Shamus look back on the beautiful moon, 
For the door of the prison must close on you soon; 
An' take your last look at her dim, misty light, 
That falls on the mountain and valley to-night. 
One look at the village, one look at the flood, 
An' one at the sheltering far-distant wood; 
Farewell to the forest, farewell to the hill, 
An' farewell to the friends that will think of you still. 
Farewell to the patthern, the burlin', an' wake, 
An' farewell to the girl that would die for your sake! 
An' twelve sojers brought him to Maryborough jail, 
An' with irons secured him, refusin' all bail. 
The fleet limbs wor chained and the sthrong hands 
wor bound, 
And he lay down his lenth on the cold presen ground, 
And the dhrames of his childhood kern over him 
there, 
As gentle and soft as the sweet summer air;

An' happy remimbrance crowdin' an ever, 
As fast as the foam flakes dhrift down an the river, 
Brinpin' fresh to his heart merry days long gone by, 
Till le tears gathered heavy an' thick in his eye. 
But the tears didn't fall, for the pride iv his heart 
Wouldn't suffer one dhrop down his pale cheek to 
start; 
An' he sprang to his feet in the dark presen cave, 
An' he swore with a 
fierceness, that misery gave, 
By the hopes iv the good an' the cause iv the brave, 
That when he was mouldering in the cowld grave, 
His inimies never should have it to boast 
His scorn iv their vengeance one moment was lost. 
His bosom might bleed, but his cheek should be dhry, 
For undaunted he lived, and undaunted he'd die. 
PART SECOND. 
Well, as soon as a 
few weeks were over an' gone, 
The terrible day of the trial came on; 
There was such a 
crowd there was scarce room to 
stand, 
An' sojers on guard, an' dragoons sword in hand. 
An' the court-house so full that the people were 
bothered, 
An' attorneys an' criers on the point of being 
smothered ; 
An' counsellors almost gave over for dead, 
An' the jury sittin' up in the box overhead. 
An' the judge settled out so determined an' big, 
An' the gown on his back, an' elegant wig, 
An' silence was call'd an' the minute ' twas said, 
The court was as still as the heart of the dead. 
An' they- heard but the opening of one prison-lock, 
An' Shamus O'Brien came into the dock—

Shamus O'Brien Songster. 
For one moment he turned his eyes round on the 
throng, 
An' then looked on the bars, so firm and so strong. 
An' he saw that he had not a 
hope nor a 
friend, 
A 
chance to escape, nor a 
word to defend; 
An' he folded his arms as he stood there alone, 
As calm an' as cold as a 
statue of stone. 
An' they read a 
big writin', a 
yard long at least, 
An' Shamtui didn't see it, nor mind it a 
taste, 
An' the judge took a 
big pinch of snuff, an' he says; 
" 
Are you guilty or not, Jim O'Brien, if you please 2" 
An' all held their breath in silence of dread, 
An' Shamus O'Brien made answer an' said ;— 
" 
My lord, if you ask me if in my life time 
I 
thought any treason or did any crime, 
That should call to my cheek, as I 
stand alone here, 
The hot blush of shame or the coldness of fear, 
Though I 
stood by the grave to receive my death. 
blow, 
Before God an' the world I 
would answer you No! 
But if you would ask me, as I 
think it like, 
If in the rebellion I 
carried a 
pike, 
An' fought for ould Ireland, from the first to the 
close, 
An' shed the heart's blood of her bitterest foes— 
I 
answer you YES 
an' I 
tell you again, 
Though I 
stand here to perish, it's my glory that 
then 
In her cause I 
am willing my veins should run dry, 
An' that now for her sake Lam willing to die." 
Then the silence was great, and the jury smiled 
bright., 
An' the judge wasn't sorry the job was made light;

By my soul its himself was the crabbed ould chapl 
In a 
twinkling he pulled on his ugly black cap. 
Then Sita,mus's mother, in the crowd standin' by, 
Called out to the judge in a 
pitiful cry, 
" 
Oh! judge, darlin,' don't—oh I 
don't say the word. 
The crathur is young—have mercy, my lord! 
" 
You don't know him, my lord! oh I 
don't give 
him to ruin ! 
He was foolish—he didn't know what he was doin' 
He's the kindliest crathur, the tenderest hearted ;— 
Don't part us forever, we that's so long parted 
"Judge mavourneen, forgive him—forgive him, my 
lord! 
An' God will forgive you—oh! don't say the word!" 
This was the first minute O'Brien was shaken, 
When he saw that he was not quite forgotten or 
forsaken! 
An' down his pale cheek, at the word of his mother, 
The big tears were running, one after the other, 
An' two or three times he endeavored to spake, 
But the strong manly voice used to falter and break. 
But at last, by the strength of his high-mounting 
pride, 
He conquer'd an' master'd his griefs swelling tide; 
An' says he, " Mother, don't—don't break your 
poor heart, 
Sure, sooner or later, the dearest must part. 
An' God knows it's better than wandering in fear 
On the bleak trackless mountains among the wild 
deer, 
To be in the grave, where the heart, head, an' breast, 
From labor and sorrow forever shall rest.

" 
Then mother, my darling, don't cry any more— 
Don't make me seem broken in this my last hour; 
For I 
wish, when my heart's lyin' under the raven, 
No true man can say that I 
died like a 
craven." 
Then towards the judge Shamus bent down his head, 
An' that minute the solemn death-sentence was said. 
PART THIRD. 
The mornin' was bright, an' the mists rose on high 
An' the lark whistled merrily in the clear sky,— 
But why are the men standing idle so late? 
An' why do the crowd gather fast in the street ? 
What come they to talk of ? 
An' why does the long rope 
Oh! Shamus O'Brien pr 
May the saints take yo

y 
fervent an' fast, 
ur soul, for this day is your 
Pray fast an' strong, for the moment is nigh, 
When strong, proud, an' great as you are, you must 
die! 
At last they drew open the big prison gate, 
And out came the Sheriffs an' sojers in state. 
An' a 
cart in the middle, an' Shamus was in it— 
Not paler, but prouder than ever, that minit, 
An' as soon as the people saw Shamus O'Brien, 
Wid prayin' an' blessin,' an' all the girls cryin' 
A wild wailin' sound kern on all by degrees, 
Like the sound of the lonesome wind blowin' 
through trees! 
On, on to the gallows the Sheriffs are gone, 
An' the car an' the sojers go steadily on. 
An' at every side swellin' around of the cart, 
A wild sorrowful sound that would open your 
heart.—

Now under the gallows the cart takes its stand, 
An' the hangman gets up with a 
rope in his hand. 
An' the priest havin' blest him gets down on the 
ground, 
An' Shamus O'Brien throws one look around. 
Then the hangman drew near, and the people grew 
still, 
Young faces turn sickly, an' warm hearts turn chill; 
An' the rope belt): ready, his neck was made bare, 
For the gripe of the life-strangling cords to prepare; 
An' the good priest has left him havin' said his last 
prayer. 
But the good priest did more—for his hands he un-
bound. 
An' with one daring spring Jim has leaped on the 
ground ! 
Bang! Bang! go the carbines, an' clash go the sa-
bres: 
lie's not down! he's alive! now attend to him, 
neighbours! 
By one shout from the people the heavens are shaken, 
One shout that the dead of the world might awaken; 
Your swords they may glitter, your carbines go bang, 
But if you want hanging ' tis yourself you must hang. 
To night he'll be sleepin' in Aherloe 
An the devil's in the dice if you catch him agin; 
The sojers run this way, the Sheriffs run that, 
An' Father Malone lost his new Sunday-hat. 
An' the Sheriffs were, both of them, punished se-
varely, 
An' fined like the devil, because Jim done them 
fai rly. 
A week after this time, without firm' a 
cannon, 
A 
sharp Yankee schooner sailed out of the Shan-
non;

An' the captain left word he was goin' to Cork, 
But the devil a 
bit—he was bound for New York. 
The very next spring—a 
bright mornin' in May,— 
An' just six months after the great hangin' day,— 
A 
letter was brought to the town of Kildare, 
An' on the outside was written out fair :— 
" 
To ould Mrs. O'Brien, in Ireland, or elsewhere." 
An' the inside began—" My dear good ould Mother, 
I'm safe, an I'm happy—an' not wishin' to bother 
You in radin'—with the help of the priest— 
I 
send you enclosed in this letter, at least, 
Enough to pay him an' to fetch you away 
To the land of the free and the brave—Amerikay! 
Here you'll be happy, an' never made cryin' 
As long as you're mother .of Shamus O'Brien. 
Give my love to sweet Biddy, an' tell her beware 
Of that spalpeen who call himself Lord of Kil-
dare;' 
An' just say to the judge, I 
don't now care a 
rap 
For him, or his wig, or his dirty black cap. 
An' as for the dragoons—them paid men of slaugh-
ter— 
Say I 
love them as well as the devil loves holy 
water. 
An' now, my good mother, one word of advice— 
Fill your bag with potatoes, an' bacon, an' rice. 
An' tell my sweet Biddy, the best way of all 
Is now, an' forever to leave ould Glengall, 
An' come with you, takin' a

The Irishman's Shanty. 
Words by Geo. W. OSBORN of Michigan. 
Did ye's ever go int'll an Irishman's shanty ? 
Och! b'ys, that's the place where the whisky is 
plenty; 
With his pipe in his mouth, there sits Paddy so 
free, 
No King in his palace is prouder than he! 
Arrah! me honey! w-h-a-c-k! Paddy's the boy. 
There's a 
three-legged stool, with a 
table to match, 
And the door of the shanty is locked with a 
latch: 
There's a 
natefeather mattrass all bustin' with straw, 
For the want of a 
bedstead it lies on the floor. 
Arrah! etc. 
There's a 
snug little bureau, without paint or gilt, 
Made of boords that was left when the shanty was 
built; 
There's a 
three-cornered mirror hangs on the wall, 
But divil the face has been in it at all. 
Arrali! etc. 
He has pigs in the sty, and cows in the stable, 
And he feeds them on scraps that is left from the 
table; 
They'd starve if confined, so they roam at their also, 
And come into the shanty whenever they plaise. 
Arrah! etc. 
He has three rooms in one—kitchen, bed-room, and 
hail! 
And his chist it is three-wooden pegs in the wall 
Two suits of owld clothes makes his wardrobe com-
plete; 
One to wear in the shanty, that same for the street.

He can relish good victuals as ever ye's ate, 
But is always continted with praties and mate; 
He prefers them when cowld (if he can't get them 
hot) 
And makes tay in a 
bowl, when he can't get a 
pot. 
Arrah! etc. 
He heeds not the rain, though it comes in a 
flood, 
For the roof of the shanty is shingled with mud. 
There's a 
hole at one end makes a 
chimney so neat 
For the smoke and the sparks from the fire to re-
treat. 
Arrah! etc. 
There's one who partakes of his sorrows and joys, 
Attends to the shanty, the girls and the boys; 
(The brats he thinks more of than gold that's re-
fined.) 
But Biddy's the jewel that's set in his mind.

O'Riley the Fisherman. 
As I 
roved out one evening fair, down by the river 
side, 
I 
heard a 
lovely maid complain, the tears fell 
from her eyes, 
This is a 
cold and stormy night, those words she 
then did say, 
My love is on the raging sea, bound for America.

My love he was a 
fisherman, his age was scarce 
eighteen, 
He was as nice a 
young man as ever yet was 
seen; 
My father he had riches great, and Riley he was 
poor, 
Because I 
loved this fisherman they could not 
him endure. 
John O'Riley was my true love's name, reared near 
the town of Bray, 
My mother took me by the hand and these words 
to me did say : 
If you be fond of Riley let him quit this country, 
Your father says he'll take his life, so shun his 
company. 
0 
mother dear,don't be severe, where will you send. 
my love, 
My very heart- lies in his breast as constant as a 
dove, 
0 
daughter dear I'm not severe, here is one thou-
sand pound, 
So send Riley to America to purchase there some 
ground. 
When Ellen got the money, to Riley she did run, 
Saying, this very night to take yo-a 
life, my fath-
er charged a 
gun, 
Here is one thousand pound in gold my mother 
sent to yotr, 
So sail away to America and I 
will follow you. 
When Riley got the money next day he sailed 
away, 
And when he put his foot on board-, those words 
she then did say: 
Here is a 
token of true love, and we'll break it now 
in two, 
You'll have my heart and half my ring until I 
find out you.

It was in three months after, as he was waiting by 
the shore, 
When Riley he came back again to take his love 
away, 
The ship was wrecked, all hands were lost, her 
father grieved full sore 
And found Riley in her arms, and they drowned 
upon the shore. 
He found a 
letter in her breast, and it was wrote 
with blood, 
Saying cruel was my father, that thought to 
shoot my love. 
So let this be now a 
warning to all fair maids so 
gay, 
To never let the lads they love, go to America. 
Father Tom O'Neil. 
PART FIRST. 
There was a 
widow lived in this place; she had 
three charming sons; 
Their father died, and left them when they were 
very young. 
A 
long time, she endeavoured to maintain her dar-
ling sons, 
Until the youngest one became a- 
man at the age of 
twenty-one. 
One night, he discoursed with his mother, these 
words to her did say: 
I 
think it will fall on one of us to go far away; 
Your land is too small to support us all, and if you 
would agree, 
I 
am fully bent and well content a 
clergyman, to 
be.

His mother being glad to hear such a

in his mind, 
She says; I 
will do all I 
can to help my darling 
child. 
She spoke unto his brothers, and they did soon 
agree 
They'd send him off to college, a 
clergyman to be. 
He was not long in college, when the Rev. Bishop 
Brown 
Came to examine the collegians, and viewed them 
all around. 
He saw this clever young man, marked him above 
them all, 
He was first he did discourse, when on them he 
did call. 
He says : Young man, where are you from ? come 
tell to me your name. 
I 
am from the county Armagh; they call me Tom 
O'Neil; 
My mother, she is a 
widow of a 
low degree; 
She has done her best endeavors to make a 
priest 
of me. 
As Thomas O'Neil then is your name, the Bishop 
he did say, 
Go study hard, both night and day; 
I 
will have you soon ordained, to help your ten-
der mother that did so well for thee; 
I 
will send you home, a 
credit, your country-boys 
to see. 
When this young man came home ordained, the 
neighbours were glad to hear. 
And all that came to welcome him, came in twos 
and threes : 
Particularly his own dear friends to welcome him 
they ran, 
And you never saw such welcome as was for the 
widow's son.

There was a 
man lived in this place: he was as 
rich as a 
Duke or Knight; 
He had an only daughter, she was a 
beauty bright; 
She says unto her father; I 
will go this young man 
to see; 
For, before he went to college, he was a 
school-boy 
along with me. 
She was brought into a 
parlor, where she drank 
ale and wine; 
She says: you are a 
clever young man, I 
would 
have you resign, 
What made you—be a 
clergyman ? you know you 
are astray ; 
For, a 
clergyman must rise by night, and travel 
hard by day. 
Come, take some noble lady, whose fortune will 
be grand; 
You will have men to wait on you, and be a 
gen-
tleman; 
Come, take myself, now as I 
stand; you know 
my fortune is great: 
I 
have ten thousand pounds a 
year, and, at a 
death, a 
whole estate. 
PART SECOND. 
He says: My noble lady, do not explain your 
mind;  
For, if you offer ten times more, I 
would not re-
sign; 
For, in this holy station I 
mean to lead my life; 
So, say no more, my dearest dear, I 
will never 
take a 
wife.

It was when he did deny her. this villain she came 
home : 
And, in eight days after, her secret she let know: 
She swore, before the magistrate, that he did her 
beguile, 
And for four long weeks, before she went to him, 
she was with child. 
The morning of his trial, it grieved our hearts 
full sore 
To see his tender mother: It ,grieved her ten 
times more 
To see her son, a 
clergyman, his age about twen-
ty-three, 
To be cut down, in his prime, by cruel perjury. 
Now, Torn, what is the reason you don't marry 
this fair ? 
I 
think she is a 
companion for a 
Duke, I 
declare: 
What are you, but a 
widow's son, that is both 
poor and mean ? 
You might think it a.great honor such a 
lady to 
obtain! 
Then Father Torn stood up and said: I 
have no 
witness here: 
I 
call on the Almighty, and he will bring me 
clear; 
I 
never said I 
would marry her, or make her my 
wife: 
For, I 
never new .a -female from a 
man in all my 
life. 
Now, Tom, as you won't marry her, I 
will give 
you to understand: 
Seven long years' transportation into Van Die-
man's Land: 
That is bad, but it might be worse.

er Toni did say:

died on Calvary.

These words were hardly spoken, when a 
horse 
came as swift as wind, 
And on him came a 
rider, saying: I 
was not here 
in time ! 
I 
call that trial over again, I 
am here that can 
reply: 
She wants two fathers for her child; that's Fath-
er Tom and I. 
I 
can tell to the very moment, likewise the very 
spot 
She gave me ten thousand pound the night the 
child was got. 
She said she would give me a 
thousand more, if 
I 
would not let on: 
She wants to make' a 
husband of the Right Rev-
erend Father Tom! 
Then, Father Tom put on his hat, and then be-
gan to smile; 
He says unto his mother: you see how God as-
sists your child! 
They looked on one another, when they found 
her perjury : 
The villain was found guilty, and his Reverence 
came home free!

You've got plenty of money, I'm told, my love; 
So your knocker I'll ring, and to court you'll sing, 
Tho' I've got a 
most shocking bad cold, my 
love. 
Then wake, for my love is so hot, my dear, 
That without you I'll soon go to pot, my dear; 
For my shirt at your clack, would stick close to my 
back; 
But the devil a 
shirt have I 
got, my dear. 
Like a 
cat my watch I'm keeping, love, 
For no bed have I 
got to sleep in, love; 
So, honey, look down, and smile me a 
frown, 
From your eyes so beautiful peeping, love. 
Old time, like the gutter, does run, my dear; 
So pray thee much modesty shun, my dear: 
Have me, I'll have you, and though still we'll be 
two, 
All Kilkenny will take us for one, my dear.

When I 
remember all 
The friends so link'd together,

Nothing At AM 
In Derry down dale when I 
wanted a 
mate, 
I 
went with my daddy, a 
courting of Kate; 
With my nosegay so fine, in my holy-day clothes, 
My hands in my pockets a courting I 
goes. 
The weather was cold, and my bosom was hot, 
My heart in a 
gallop—my mare in a 
trot— 
Now I 
was so bashful, so loving withal, 
My tongue studh to my mouth, and I 
said 
Nothing at all. 
When I 
came to the house, I 
look'd bashful and 
grum, 
The knocker I 
held twixt my finger and thumb, 
Rap went the knocker, Kate showed her chin, 
She chuckled and buckled, I 
bowed and went in. 
Now I

Mister Barney. 
Mister Barney one day went to Limerick 'fair, 
And hired a 
noddy to carry him there, 
To meet pretty Shelah Megan. 
But Shelah had waited some time for the boy, 
And thought he'd been playing with Katty Molloy, 
To tell him her mind thus began: 
Och! Mister Barney, 
None of your carney; 
Hands off; and don't be so. free; 
You've been with the ,girls, 
Your muffin face tells, 
And the devil may have you for me, Mister Barney. 
Mister Barney, who little thought thus to be used, 
Made an oath that his word and honour she abus'd 
And could she be Shelah Megan ? 
Then running to kiss her—she cried, if you're wise, 
Don't touch me, or, Barney, I'll scratch out your 
eyes, 
I 
know you're a 
vile wicked man. 
So, Mister Barney, 
None of your carney; 
Hands off, and don't be so free; 
You've been with the girls, 
Your baby-face tells, &c. 
Mister Barney then pull'd out a

And told her that since he had nothing to hope,

The Poor Lover. 
A TE —Love-sick Looby. 
I 
came to the world with no shirt to my back, 
'Tis useless the matter to mince, 
And through all my youth and my manhood, good 
lack, 
I've been put to my shifts ever since; 
I 
wish'd for a 
partner to lighten my woe, 
Resolv'd in sweet wedlock to dash; 
But ev'ry young maid I 
accosted said no, 
And only because I'd no cash. 
Oh dear! Oh dear! 
A 
poor man in love—when he feels Cupid's wound, 
Is like a 
stray donkey lock'd up in a 
pound. 
The young maids all laugh'd loud at me and my 
prate, 
So necessity made me more bold, 
I 
made up my mind I 
would e'en try my fate, 
With maidens who'd got rather old. 
But old maids I 
found a 
more difficult case, 
Though I 
tried all I 
could, I 
am sure; 
Each—one and all, shut their doors in my face, 
As soon as they found I 
was poor. 
Oh dear! Oh dear! 
A 
poor man in love may bemoan his fate, 
He's like a 
fat pig sticking fast in a 
gate. 
As old maids or young ones I 
could not implore, 
The widows I 
thought of, so I 
E'en brush'd my old coat which I'd oft brush'd be-
fore, 
And brush'd off—my fortune to try. 
But when they saw how my coat, so threadbare, 
Was from all its former nap free; 
They said, though quite ticklish, they never could 
care 
About being tickled by me.

He's like a

Thus maids, young and old too, and widows I've 
tried, 
And woo'd them in love's language plain 
But 'cause I 
am poor, I 
am always denied, 
And find all my wooing in vain. 
If any young lady true pity has got, 
For such an unfortunate elf; 
I'd wed her to-morrow and join her with lot, 
'Flio' she be as poor as myself.

They care not for father's or brothers; 
And who shall pretend to say where ' twill end

As to music 'tis easy—quite easy— 
Learn painting and chalks, and each one she talks 
About singing and thinks she's a

At their mothers they always are mocking 
With all sorts of nonsense themselves they engage 
It really is shocking—quite shocking.

Doing plain work, and hemming and sewing ;

Was a

I 
hear people say that we live in the day 
Of intellect, steam, and improvement ; 
Each new bonnet or shawl no longer they call 
A 
new fashion, but say its " a 
movement." 
As to bonnets—oh law! all the good they are for! 
The sight in my mind still it rankles ; 
Don't you think I 
am right when I 
say that they 
might 
Just as well have been tied round the ankles ? 
I 
don't know, &c. 
Sometimes, though, they go to the other extremes, 
For at all the famed watering places 
The hats that they wear have such brims,I declare, 
That you can't see a 
bit of their faces. 
They surely can't know, if they wish for a 
beau! 
That this is the plan ne'er to gain one ; 
For the gentlemen vow that they cannot tell now

pretty girl is from a

bran new diversion had found now, 
She sings through her nose, makes baloons of her 
clothes, 
And that she calls "bobbing around" now.

Or deep in the woodland shade, 
With my good yew bow in my hand I 
go, 
As free as the bird or the wild red roe; 
And the woods ring out with a 
song and shout, 
For I'm the king of the forest glade 
The sparkling brooks they mirror the looks 
Of the bright blue laughing sky, 
And sweet flowers spring, and the gnarled oaks fling 
Their mighty limbs on high.

Without nut-brown forest maids 
with my bold, bold freres, who doff the cares 
Which the hollow worldling seeks and shares.

For I

Are Erin's sons so good or so cold, 
As not to be tempted by woman or gold ?" 
" 
Sir Knight! I 
feel not the least alarm, 
No son of Erin will offer me harm, 
For though they love women and golden store, 
Sir Knight! they love honor and virtue more !" 
On she went, and her maiden smile 
In safety lighted her round the green isle; 
And blest for ever is she who relied 
Upon Erin's honor, and Erin's pride.

It gives me very great delight well all here to see, 
Faith, well and hearty, sure I

Of myself I'm not ashamed a

Me name is Darby Kyle, 
From the county of Mayo, 
And the star of Erin's Isle. 
Of me birth and parentage, proud I

For the very simple rayson, no parents could I 
find 
If noble they should be, faith more credit 'tis for me 
If spalpeens, why thin, I 
care not to know my pedi-
gree. 
So here I 
go, Sic. 
One day I 
saw a 
beauty, holy murther, sich a

She was bright as daylight, brilliant as the sun, 
The morning top, I 
said to her, no more faith could 
I 
say, 
Rebels and Tories; OR, THE BLOOD OF THE M OHAWK. 
The noble race that fought the battles for freedom seem alive again.

said me dear, look you here, 
My name is Darby Kyle, 
From the county of Mayo, 
And the star of Erin's Isle.

felt, like one in love, 
The image look'd of _

I 
said me dear, &c. 
I 
felt so queer, over here, outside, inside out, 
By the powers felt, I 
did'nt know what I 
was, 
I 
only knew, I 
kissed her, said she, " Just take back 
that " 
For an hour kissing to and fro, how beautiful is that.

said me dear, &c. 
Wo hurried both together, I 
went first in greatest 
haste, 
And so the two, tight as glue, gumm'd were they by

mar, 
And yearly I

Haste to the wedding. 
You ask for a 
song, and indeed I'm quite sorry 
I 
cannot oblige the good company here ; 
Were I 
to begin you would find in a 
burry, 
The guests would depart and the coasts would be 
clear; 
They could not sit still to have their ears pestered, 
By such horrid notes but away they would run 
To some lone desert or valley sequestered, 
And give that the preference fifty to one. 
But since that you seem so desirous to hear me, 
I 
now will endeavour—this trial's my best; 
I 
sure shall be laughed at by those who sit near 
me, 
And those afar off will make me their jest.

They trudged along together, met a 
Scotchman on 
their way, 
" 
Oh, lend us a 
Bob, now, Scotty, to help us on our

"Lend you a 
bob," said Scotty, " faith and sure," 
said he,

It's the only thing I 
wanted, for I'm not worth a

"I have three-pence," said the Englishman, " What 
shall I 
do with that?" 
" 
Oh, buy three pen'orth of whiskey, it will cheer 
us up," said Pat, 
" 
Don't do that," said the Scotchman, " I'll tell you 
what to do, 
"Buy three pen'orth of oatmeal, and we'll all of us 
have burgoo." 
" 
Now with my three-pence," said the Englishman, 
" 
half-quartern loaf, what say, 
And in yonder haystack we'll sleep all hunger 
away, 
We can quench our thirst by the running brook 
beside the broiling stream, 
And the loaf shall be his in the morning who 
dreams the largest dream." 
John Bull he dreamed by the morning that ten 
thousand men had been 
For ten years digging a 
turnip up, the largest ever 
was seen, 
At last they got his turnip up by working night 
and day. 
And it took five thousand horses to draw this tur-

"

Oh, well I 
remember that sweet little creature 
That lives in the cot at the foot of the hill, 
Whose smiles and good humour adorn every fea-
ture, 
And close by her cot runs a 
murmuring rill. 
Her cot is adorned with sweet woodbine and roses, 
Her mouth, when she speaks, such perfection dis-
closes, 
Her breath, too, surpasses the sweetness of roses, 
I'd give all the world could I 
once call her mine. 
I 
met her last night when my heart nigh forsook 
me, 
She blushed like the rose, as I 
took her hand 
And sweetly exclaimed, " Sir, I 
think you've mis-
took me, 
Or if not, your meaning I 
don't understand." 
"133lieve me," said I, " love, I

thee, 
And all for the honour of calling thee mine."

Of a 
very nice young man, 
The case I'll lay before ye, 
In the mildest form I 
can : 
This man was vain, a 
male coquette, 
Made love to every girl he met, 
And when he thought he'd gained the day, 
he'd take his hat and walk away, 
With his fal, lal la la, 
Good-bye love, 
Fal, lal, la, la, la, la, la. 
At length by a 
freak of nature, 
This nice young man was caught 
By a 
very pretty creature, 
Who did as all young ladies ought. 
She'd wealth in store, and that you know, 
Goes a 
great way to procure a 
beau, 
And then it was, as people say, 
He had no mind to walk away, 
With his fal, lal, la, la, &c. 
Behold them at the altar, 
The parson questioned so, 
" 
Wilt thou take this man for thy husband ?'' 
She straightway answered, " No !"

There dwelt a 
miller, hale and bold, 
Beside the river Dee, 
He work'd and sung from morn till night4 
No lark more blithe than be; 
And this, the burden of his song, 
For ever used to be— 
"I envy nobody, no, not I, 
And nobody envies me." 
" 
Thou'rt wrong, my friend," said old King Hal, 
" 
Thou'rt wrong as wrong can be; 
For could my heart be light as thine, 
I'd gladly change with thee. 
And tell me now what makes thee sing, 
With voice so loud and free, 
While I 
am sad, though I 
am the King, 
Beside the river Dee." 
The miller smiled, and doffed his cap, 
" 
I 
earn my bread," qUoth he, 
" 
I 
love my wife, I 
love my friend, 
I 
love my children three ; 
I 
owe no penny I 
cannot pay: 
I 
thank the river Dee— 
That turns the mill—that grinds the corn— 
To feed my babes and me." 
" 
Good friend," said Hal, and sigh'd the while, 
" 
Farewell : and happy be : 
But cry no more, if thou'dst be true, 
That no one envies thee ; 
Thy mealy cap is worth my crown— 
Thy mill my. kingdom's fee : 
Such men as these are England's boast, 
0, Miller of the Dee."

Jane Julian was the prettiest girl that ever I 
had 
seen, 
And like other ladies, wore an ample crinoline. 
I 
own that I 
was deeply smitten by her charms, 
And I 
tried every art I 
could to win her to my 
arms. 
CHORUS. 
They said her understanding was weak and very 
queer, 
If you look under her crinoline it quickly would 
appear. 
I 
often had conversed with her, but could discover 
not, 
But what good understanding she had surely got, 
Yet strange tales of slander, scandahnongers made 
appear 
That Julia's understanding was really queer. 
They said, &c. 
I 
met her at a 
party, invited out to dine, 
Where all the ladies did remain to take dessert and 
wine, 
The conversation took a 
turn by a 
witty wig, Dick 
Creggs, 
That all had queer understanding that had got 
cork legs.

and chalk,

By the Sad Sea Waves. 
By the sad sea waves, I 
listen while they moan 
A 
lament o'er graves of hope and pleasure gone; 
I 
am young, I 
was fair, 
I 
had once not a 
care, 
From the rising of the moon to the setting of the 
sun; 
Yet I 
pine like, a 
slave, 
By the sad sea waves; 
Come again, bright days of hope and pleasure gone. 
From my care last night by holy sleep beguil'd 
In the dream light my home upon me smiled; 
Oh, how sweet, 'mid the dew, 
Every flower that I 
knew 
Breathed a 
welcome back to the worn and weary 
I 
awoke in my grave, 
By the sad sea waves; 
Come again, bright dream, so peacefully that smiled

ye, Sons of Green Erin, assemble, 
And join in the battle's array ! 
The usurpers and traitors shall tremble, 
When they see the Brigade in the fray. 
Go, march to the battle-field proudly, 
Nor e'en let your march be delayed, 
Till the English fly in terror before you, 
When charged by the Fenian Brigade. 
CHORUS, 
'When charged by the Fenian Brigade, 
When charged by the Fenian Brigade; 
Till the English fly4 in terror before you, 
When charged by the Fenian Brigade! 
Old Granna has looked o'er the ocean, 
And beard the fierce bugle of Mars; 
And the strength of her heart's high devotion 
Was roused for the Stripes and the Stars; 
Now she raises her voice loud as thunder 
That voice which was always obeyed 
Saying : " Boys, cut the English asunder, 
With the swords of your Fenian Brigade !" 
With the swords of your Fenian Brigade, 
With the swords of your Fenian Brigade; 
Saying: " Boys, cut the English a-sunder, 
With the swords of your Fenian Brigade; 
In view of the guilt and the treason, 
The people of Ireland still sigh 
Let us up and defend them in season, 
And bring back the joy to their eye; 
Bear the Emerald Green proudly o'er you: 
Let the English at your might be dismayed;

Mother, Re's Going Away. 
Now what are you crying for, Nelly, 
Don't be blushing there like a 
fool, 
With the weight of the grief faith I 
tell you, 
You'll break down the three-legged stool. 
I 
suppose now you're crying for Barney, 
But don't believe a 
word that he'd say, 
He tells nothing but big lies and Blarney, 
Sure you know how he sarved poor Kate Kearney.

But mother," " Och bother," 
" 
But mother, he's going, away, 
And I 
dreamt Vother night, 
Of his ghost all in white ; 
Oh, mother he's going away." 
If he's going away all the better, 
Blessed hour when he's out of your sight, 
There's one comfort you can't get a 
letter, 
For ye's neither can read nor can write. 
Sure t'was only last week you protested, 
Since he courted fat Jinny M'Cray, 
That the sight of the scamp you detested, 
'With abuse sure your tongue never rested. 
" 
But mother," " Och, bother,"

But mother, he's going away, 
And I

Walking round my bed post;

And tear down English tyranny, and plant sweet

It's in the Fetlian Brotherhood he has enrolled his

He'll crash down English tyranny, and help its 
overthrow. 
Remember your fore-fathers, beneath its earth, they 
lay 
Under the foot of tyranny—it ought to make you 
sigh 
To think they died in bondage, under the English 
laws ! 
Now is your opportunity, boys, to avenge their 
cause.

father-land,

The Three Best Irish Romances ever Written, 
PRICE TIVENTY-PIVE CE,NTS EACH. 
TIIE ,
PPI\TIAI\T CHIEF; 
OR, THE MARTYR OF '65. 
This book describes, most graphically, the bold attempt of a 
young, ardent, whole-souled Irishman to assist in freeing his native 
land. 
Mingled with the exciting incidents now progressing in the 
Green Isle, through the efforts of the powerful organization, Fenian. 
Ism, are some of the most pathetic love passages ever portrayed; 
while they in their turn, are chequered by descriptions of rich and 
racy drollery. 
This is a 
book that would find hosts of readers at any 
time—now it will be read by almost everybody. 
SI-IA_MT_TS O'BRIEN; 
OR, THE BOI7LD BOY OF GLENGALL. 
The very title of this book explains its scope and nature. 
The 
young hero, O'Brien, lives and will ever live in the hearts of his 
countrymen while the green triple-leaved type of immortality and the 
trinity carpets the sod of Old Ireland. 
In this book, the author has 
contrived to give us one of the best books we have everread in many 
years. 
It is full of stirring incident, of marked character, drawing, 
and the plot is full of rare interest.

The verdict of tens of thousands of unbiased spectators have 
pronounced this play (and consequently this story formed upon it), 
to be one of the most natural and affecting pieces ever produced. 
Never for an instant overstepping the probabilities of real life, it ex-
ceeds in the power of affecting the feelings the most labored produc-
tions of the greatest writers. 
The lovely, artless heroine, Arrah 
Meelish, might stand for the embodiment of the pretty, true-hearted 
Irish girl; while Shaun of the Post, is a 
capital type of the peasant 
class: here too, we have a 
life-like picture of the infernal " informer, ,, 
that creature who has blighted the hopes of Erin's truest sons, and 
crimsoned the scaffold with patriot blood. Nor are there wanting 
other and capital characters to enliven and lend interest to the pages 
of " Arrah-na-Pogue, ,, and make every gratified reader wish they 
might be present, and join in a 
jig at the next " Wicklow Wedding.”
