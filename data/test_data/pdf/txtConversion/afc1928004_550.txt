Peach And Honey. 
Words by Edward IIaley. 
Music by Thomas Haley, and 
originally sung by them with great success. 
I 
love to sing of flowers rare 
And inhale the sweet perfume, 
Of roses red and violets fair, 
When they are in full bloom ; 
The daisies, too, they are so dear to me, (Symph.) 
The fill my soul with joy and eestaey. (do.) 
But there's one thing I 
dearly love, 
To you it may seem funny, 
I 
love to inhale the sweet perfume 
That comes from peach and honey. 
Dance. 
'Tis so nice to pick the peaches ripe, 
When they're dangling from the trees; 
And gather honey from the comb 
In the absence of the bees. 
In my sleep I 
dream of nothing else 
(Symph.; 
Bu , peach and honey on the pantry shelf (do.) 
In case that I 
desire to wed 
In the bonds of matrimony, 
And the union should be blessed with twins, 
I 
shall call them peach and honey. 
Dance,

Erin Green Isle. 
Words and :11Iusic by Edward Haley, and sung by the Mup 
phys, Paddy and Ella, in all the principal Theatres in 
the United States. 
There's a 
dear spot of land far out in the sea, 
And it's known as fair Erin's green isle, 
Sure it's there I 
was born one bright summer's morn, 
And with joy my relations did smile. 
My father and mother, my sister and brother 
Were pleased, to be sure, all the while ; 
And they shed tears of joy for their bright Irish boy, 
That was born on fair Erin's green isle. 
You may talk of Old England, of France and of Spain, 
Of their beautiful maids and great men, 
But the whole world cloth know that fair Erin can show 
Nobler sons, fairer daughters than them. 
I 
can mention such names as O'Connel and Moore, 
And the brave Duke of Wellington, while 
King Brian Borhue, and brave Ennnet, too, 
Saw the light on fair Erin's green isle. 
The Lakes of Killarney, on Erin's green isle, 
Are lovely, enchanting and fine. 
Our mountains and va.leys are second to none ; 
Their beauty is really sublime. 
There the shamrock cloth grow in plenty, you know, 
Encouraged by nature's sweet smile. 
Dear land of my birth; garden spot of the earth— 
You're my idol, fair Erin's green isle.

THE VISION OF MY DREAMS. 
Words by LowAno HALEY. :
Melody by THOMAS H ALEY. 
SONG AND DANCE. 
While strolling on the beach at Coney Island, 
And listening to the murmuring of the sea, 
A pretty, fascinating belle of fashion, 
Dropped her silk handkerchief in front of me; 
Whqt could I 
do but pick it up, 
She thanked me as she took it from my hand; 
As I ;trolled on the boach that afternoon, I 
thought, 
Her the fairest little creature in the land. 
Cnonus: 
-While indulging in my slumbers on that evening, 
To me like an angel she did seem; 
Now, t 
find that I 
cannot live without her, 
When I 
sleep, she's the vision of my dreams. 
Dance. 
I 
will call upon the captivating little beauty, 
And offer her my heart and hand for life; 
And if the little charmer will accept me, 
I'll protect her from all sorrow, care and strife. 
I 
think I 
see her sparkling eyes, 
As bright as any diamonds in the land; 
Bed, rosy cheeks, and teeth of pearly white, 
Cinderella feet and tiny little hands. 
C
HORUS: 
She's as handsome and as pretty as a 
picture, 
In fact, the only maiden that I've seen; 
She's the guardian of my future happiness, 
When I 
sleep, she's the vision of my dreams. 
Words by EDWARD HALEY. 
Music by THOMAS HALEY. 
Originally sung by " The 2 
HALEYS," EDWARD and THOMAS. 
Of all the pretty charmers that we seen, 
In the way of feminine beauty; 
Melinda Snow she is my pride, 
And to love her is my duty. 
With majestic step she walks along the street, 
(Symphony). 
A smile on her countenance loving and sweet, 
(Symphony). 
She's the daintiest darling of them all, 
If she was'nt I 
would'nt say so; 
I 
was struck with Cupid's dart, 
By handsome, charming, sweet Melinda Snow. 
t 
Dance) 
I 
took Melinda to a 
ball one night, 
And we glided through the merry Lancers; 
My arm I 
gently stole around her waist, 
And we exchanged such very loving glances. 
On that eve she promised me to wed, (Symphony). 
I 
was overjoyed at what she said, ( Symphony). 
I 
shall love and cherish her through life, 
As o'er the rugged path of life we both go; 
She will be my beacon l.ight, 
Handsome, Charming, sweet Melinda Snow. 
(Dance). 
PRETTY KATE. 
Written by CHAS. R. 
DOCKSTADER. 
Sung by T. M. HENGLER as the latest great hit of the season. 
I've a 
story I'm going to tell you all, 
Of a 
beautiful, bewitching Irish girl; 
She's a 
picture true to nature, 
She's a 
gem, an emerald pearl; 
There's a 
something you cannot but admire. 
Such a 
beauty I'm sure was never seen; 
You'll know her if you meet her, 
My pretty Irish Queen. 
CIIORUS: 
I 
call her Katie, dear, (Break). 
I'm happy when she's near, (Break). 
Her picture's imprinted on my memory, 
To me I 
know she will be true; 
Her blue eyes look like diamonds, 
Kissed by the morning dew, 
I 
met her among the fields and flowers, 
By the side of a 
little pearling stream; 
And the memory of that meeting, 
Comes to me like a 
dream; 
She blushed and•said her name was Katie, 
As her little hand I 
took in mine; 
Oh my Katie, lovely Katie, 
My Irish girl divine.

When the Flowers have gone to Roost. 
By CHARLES R. 
DOCKSTADER, and sung by " The 2 HALEYS. -
Where the Watermelons grow, 
The wind in the key of Z (loth blow: 
Where the gurgling riplets ramble, 
O'er the mossy, jack-stones; 
Meet me with thy glossy smile, 
Blushes fan thy granite brow; 
Sylph- like glide thy cowhide foot steps, 
Goodness, hello my Annie. 
Cnottus: 
When the flowers walk in their sleep, 
And the night-mare trots the deep: 
Race back home and help us eat, 
Boston Baked Beans, my Annie. 
When thy young heart, pure and free, 
Beats dead, beats alone for me; 
Music, Mickey, Mikey, oh! 
Thin be jabez, Annie; 
Och, dii bist verrUckt mein kinct, 
Pigeon-toed are thy footsteps; 
Hear the hydrant how it gurgles, 
By the Tau Yard, Annie. 
Citoftus: 
When the flowers walk in their sleep, 
And the willows sob and weep; 
Gently heifers softly creep. 
Oh be gosh, my Annie. 
Written by EDWARD HALEY. 
Sung by " The 2 
H ALEYs." 
 :o:— 
I'm an Irish grass widdy, not long in the city, 
My husband and me from Ireland we came; 
If you'll all pay attention to what I 
will mention, 
I 
know that your eyes with excitement will flame. 
My own darling Paddy, this poor gossoon's daddy. 
Has left me in sorrow his absence to mourn; 
When I 
think of the divil, I 
grow quite uncivil, 
And sometimes I 
wish that I 
never was born. 
He Y1111 off to Cuba, wid a 
girl he called Judy, 
A hold of her nose I 
would like for to take; 
The shameless ould strumpet, her head I 
could bump it 
Every bone in her body by my sowl I 
could break. 
If I 
set my two eyes on, I 
think I 
could poison, 
The cause of my troubles, Miss Judy McCabe; 
All day long I 
am sighing, sobbing and crying, 
For he left me alone wid my poor little babe. 
I 
have a 
great notion to cross the wide ocean, 
And go back to Erin, the land I 
adore; 
I 
love dear ould Ireland, its brakes and its mireland, 
And never from there will I 
roam any more. 
But if you should see Paddy, this poor gossoon's daddy, 
Give him my blessing, and tell him for me; 
That I 
fun tired of living, and freely forgive him, 
For I 
am going home to die in the Ould Country.

to 
O'REILLY vs. McDERMOTT. 
Written by PATRICK NEESON for SAM RICKEY, and originally recited 
by EDWARD HALEY, of " The 2 HALEYS. 
Not one hundred yards from where I 
stand, 
In this, our glorious Union land, 
Was kept a 
first-class whisky stand 
By a 
man, and his name was O'Connor. 
A man that's known both near and far, 
Attends to Mike O'Connor's bar, 
He, in our late war, received no scar, 
And his name is O'Reilly. 
Beneath our starry banners wave, 
There was not a 
man fought half so brave, 
Or more greenbacks for whisky gave, 
Than McDermott. 
O'Connor's gin- mill blazed with light, 
On that eventful and bloody night, 
When McDermott had the fearful fight 
With O'Reilly. 
With frowning brow and flashing eye, 
O'Reilly drank a 
glass of rye, 
Which he demolished without a 
sigh; 
Then turning to McDermott, he said, 
You alcoholic vat! 
you drunken loon! 
You've no more brains than a 
wee gossoon; 
Begorra, I'll make you change your tune, 
Says McDermott. 
With sleeves rolled up, O'Reilly stood 
And swore he'd die, before he would 
Take back a 
single word that could 
in any manner be construed 
Into an apology to McDermott. 
McDermott went for O'Reilly's nose, 
And on it planted fearful blows, 
Till on his eye a 
shanty arose, 
Erected by McDermott. 
O'Reilly fell into a 
swoon, 
And his head rested on a 
big spittoon; 
Then he dreamt of Barnum's big Balloon, 
While McDermott quietly put on his 
Coat, and went home about his business.

SUNG BY BILLY EMERSON. 
I'm gwine away by the light of the moon, 
Want all the children for to follow me ; 
I 
hope I'll meet you darkies soon, 
Halle, halle, halle, hallelujah! 
So tell the brothers that you meet, 
Want all the children for to follow me; 
That I 
will travel on my feet, 
Halle, halle, halle, hallelujah! 
CHORUS 
In the morning, by the bright light, 
Hear Gabriers trumpet in the morning! 
Go get a 
match and light that lamp, 
Want all the children for to follow me ; 
And show me the way to the Baptist camp, 
Halle, halle, halle, hallelujah! 
We'll have beefsteak and sparerib stew 
Want all the children for to follow me ; 
And nice boiled onions, clipped in dew, 
Halle, halle, halle, hallelujah ! 
I'll take my old banjo along, 
Want all the children for to follow me; 
in case the boys should sing a 
song, 
Halle, halle, halle, hallelujah ! 
For no one has to pay no fare, 
Want all the children for to follow me; 
So don't forget to curl your hair, 
Halle, halle, halle, hallelujah !

True Irish Gent. 
Words and music by PADDY M URPHY. 
Copyrighted and published by F. 
A. 
NORTH, Music Publisher, 
Philadelphia Pa. 
It's a 
shame on the stage how they mimic our race, 
In a 
style that's a 
mystery to me. 
How the gentry in front will stand such insults, 
And receive such block-heads with glee. 
But if they went to old Ireland they'd make their mistake, 
For our boys in style are well dressed, 
And in manners as well to you I'll now tell, 
Sure they stand in this land with the best. 
CHORUS. 
For singing and dancing, and all kinds of fun, 
And if ever to old Ireland you went, 
From their head to their toes they wear stylish clothes— 
I 
speak of a 
True Irish Gent. 
Some make up their face and look just like fools, 
And walk like a 
dog with three legs ; 
But if they went to old Ireland to show them such fun, 
They would pelt them with stones and bad eggs. 
For it's there you'll find ladies and gentlemen, too, 
Educated, kind-hearted and true, 
And I 
hope that we'll see that little isle free, 
And the green with the red, white and blue. 
For singing and dancing, &c. 
The Colored Embassadors. 
Written and composed by C. R. DOCKSTADER for H INES and BLossom 
and sung by them with immense success in all the principal 
theatres tnroughout the United States. 
'We are two colored swells from South Car'lina, 
Two highly educated Senators 
On our way to Congress we have stopped to see you, 
Our minds to fame cloth soar. 
We set the public crazy, such speeches you never heard, 
Apd we will have our way, and fix things up in Congress 
For we are two thoroughbreds, 
Oh yes, we are thoroughbreds, ( Sym.) Senators. (Sym.) 
CHORUS. 
Then it's, Oh, my, we're number one, 
Our way we'll have when we reach Washington. 
Our style will turn their heads, 
And we'll show them that we are thoroughbred Senators. 
Now there isn't two more figs in South Car'lina 
Like us two highly educated coons; 
And we'll show them, when we reach the Legislatm 
They must just dance to our tunes. 
And when we reach the White House, 
And get within its doors, 
We'll show them that we are two thoroughbreds, 
Two highly educated Senators. 
Then it's, Oh, my, &c. 
Written by JERRY COHAN for W ALLY PRICE M OTTO SINGER, 
Of all the great levers that move this world, 
The principal ones are but three; 
And when my strange argument I 
unfold, 
Wise people with me will agree. 
The Newspaper ball keeps rolling on, 
While the Pulpit controls the mind; 
The theories that these powers expound, 
Are moving ones you'll find. 
The Theatre, too, does not fail to improve, 
The wisdom of every age; 
So the principal levers that make the world mows, 
Are the Pulpit, the Press, and the Stage. 
Conviction is carried to every one, 
That this life's but a 
fleeting show; 
So Religion is the lever strong, 
To remind us of this, we know. 
Why the veriest hypocrite that can talk, 
And wear sanctimonious ways, 
Let him enter the Pulpit, we listen, and oft 
are persuaded to believe all he says. 
The Christian, the Infidel, no matter what, 
The wicked, good, weak and strong, 
Must acknowledge the Pulpit a 
lever of power, 
And it moves this world along. 
THE PULPIT, 
THE PRESS, 
AND THE STAGE. 
CONTINUED. 
Next comes the Press, a 
most wonderful power, 
That we love, we fear and admire;. 
It tells us the doings of every hour, 
And of all events as they transpire. 
Its reviewed by all classes, all nations and men, 
Propounding the wrong and right; 
Observe how the Press has improved the world, 
And brought us from darkness' to light. 
It brings closer together all countries apart, 
Of all races of men tis the voice; 
The Press moves the world with unerring power, 
'Tis a 
lever in which we rejoice. 
Next comes the Stage, nature's mirror so true, 
'Tis both criticised, praised and condemned; 
But the Pulpit and Press has abuses, too, 
And the Stage has so much to commend. 
The grandest of minds were its patron's, I'll prove, 
Even those who have worshipped the Press; 
And spoke from the Pulpit the doctrine we love, 
Its Charities cannot grow less. 
So the Stage moves the world with the Pulpit and 
Press, 
In one how ' twill portray a 
whole age; 
And the principal levers that move the world, 
Are the Pulpit, the Press and the Stage.

AIR: " Champagne Charley." 
Some time ago there was a 
fig, 
Who used to go about, 
A 
screaming " Who'll buy my string clams, 
I 
feel so awful stout." • 
This nig he was the size of a 
pig 
A 
feeding in the sty, 
And the only thing that happened him, 
He had a 
string clam eye. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, String Clam Jimmy was his name, 
his old woman never could make him tame, 
He'd roar with fright both day and night, 
For String Clam Jimmy was his name, ta, ta. 
Now Jimmy he fell in love one day 
With a 
girl with cross-eyed feet; 
She said she would not let him go 
Until she'd cut his teeth. 
She busted his poor pocketbook, 
Which made him fell so sore ; 
She gave him the slip and split his lip, 
Then skipped right out the door. 
Oh, String Clam Jimmy, & c. 
(Repeat.) 
Dear Jimmy is contented now, 
He never goes about, 
He says bad times has spoiled the trade, 
Now don't that nigger shout. 
He feels so weak, he's got a 
cheek 
About three ton and a 
half, 
He looked so nice they put him on ice, 
Now how's that for a 
latiOl?

There Never was a 
Coward Where the Shamrock 
Grows. 
Respectfully dedicated to Fayette Welsh, and sung with great 
success by Edwin Talbot in his Parlor entertainments. 
Let cowardly slanderers say what they may, 
Against the clear land of my birth ; 
But I 
will maintain in spite of all foes, 
It's the clearest green spot on this earth. 
Some say we are cowards and tit for naught else 
But drinking our home-made potheen 
But I'll throw back the villainous lie in their face, 
We're as brave as the shamrock is green. 
CHORUS. 
Pat may be foolish and very often wrong, 
Pat s 
got a 
temper which don't last very long, 
Pat is full of jollity as everybody knows. 
But there never was a 
coward where the shamrock grows. 
Tho' oppress'd and insulted for hundreds of years 
By the foe who once conquered them, they 
Have left us the courage our forefather's had— 
For that they cannot take away. 
They kept learning from us, stole all we hold dear, 
And crushed us till others cried shame; 
But in spite of it all we have struggled to learn 
That courage and wit are the same. 
Chorus. 
The Cottage by the Lane. 
Composed by J'AmEs R. WALsH. Performed by WALsn and K ING. 
When the stars are shining brightly 
In the azure dome above, 
And the dews are falling lightly 
I 
go to see my love. 
I 
meet her at our trysting, 
Near the Cottage by the lane, 
And while the hours are passing, 
Our love we tell again. 
CHORUS. 
When the stars are shining brightly, 
An evening comes again, 
Then I 
haste to see my charmer, 
In the Cottage by the lane. 
Close beside a 
latticed window . 
In the arbor by the gate, 
When the rosy sun is setting, 
Impatiently I 
wait. 
When the door she opens softly, 
And welcomes me again, 
Then I 
feel like never leaving 
The Cottage by the lane. 
When the stars, & c. 
CABIN FLOOR. 
An original Song and Dance. sung by BARLOW BROTHERS at 
Harrigan & Hart's and Tony Pastor's Theatres. 
W HEN we were two little coons, 
On old Virginia shore, 
The old man showed us how to dance 
Upon the cabin floor; 
The steps he learned us how to take, 
We'll show them now to you, 
And this is how we done it, 
Before we wore a 
shoe. 
CHORUS. 
The old man learned us this rap, 
[gym.] 
He made our toes fly flip- flap, 
[Syin.] 
Our education we did get: 
In happy days gone by, 
Old mother she would laugh at us, • 
Until she'd almost cry; 
I 
wish those days would come again, 
Those happy days of yore, 
When first we learned how to dance, 
Upon the cabin floor. 
When we hear the music play, 
We like to get a 
dance, 
To knock the dust out of the cracks, 
Because we love to dance; 
And when we get so very old, 
That we can't dance no more, 
We hope our bones will get a 
rest, 
Beneath the cabin floor. 
The old man, etc.

COMIC CHARACTER SONG. 
Words and music 
Sung with great success by 
M URPHY and M ACK. 
It's very strange indeed to me, that go where'er I 
may, 
So many queer remarks I 
hear about me every day ; 
'Twas but last night upon the street, my style the boys did quiz. 
And one says " You can have it pards, if you guess what it is !" 
Sl'OKEN—As soon as they saw me they shouted, " Here it 
comes !" and as I 
approach they all began to sing— 
CHORUS. 
What is it ? heavens what is it ? 
Does it live do you know ? or is it a 
chromo ? 
Did it blow out, or did it grow out ? 
Oh ! for heaven's sake, what is it ? 
'Twas in the Park, a 
lively mob at me did talk and stare, 
" 
I 
wonder if it's loaded, and if that's all its own hair," 
it lives, it breathes," one chap did say, its pulse is all serene. 
Approaching me " Old Krank," says he, " I'll see that you're 
kept g
i
,r een! 
SPOKEN—Yes, and when I 
say a 
word back, they shout, 
" 
Look out for it, it's teethin' !" and then again comes the 
conundrum— 
What is it, & c. 
They asked how long I 
walked alone, and say " when were 
you canned ?" 
And hint I'd look much better if upon my head I'd stand; 
And as around the Square I 
walk, with gloves and cane and 
pipe, 
I 
heard them whisper everywhere, " I 
wonder if it's ripe !" 
SPOKEN—Yes, they want to know if I'm natural or artificial, 
and how many of me there are in a 
bunch, and whether I'm 
good raw t 
1314t alaav 
111 they wildly ask—

Hand in hand our dance shall be, 
Pleasure's brimming cup we'll drain, 
While it holds its joyful reign, 
In your arms circling round, 
Love's sweet mystery may be found, 
Dance of Cupid may it be, 
Come, love, waltz with me. 
CHORUS. 
Written and performed by JERRY COHAN. 
Och 'hone, I'm desarted sure, 
My looks they are demure, 
My fair form is fading fast away; 
The rose has left my cheek, 
With sorrow I 
can't spike, 
The choking sobs they bother night and day. 
I 
once was fat and fair, widyurty yaller hair, 
Me eyes they were the brightest, so they say; 
But when Dinny stole my heart, 
Soon my beauty did depart, 
And I'm lonesome since my darlin whit away. 
Cno nus 
Oh he's gone! gone! gone! 
Will he ever more return? 
I 
never can forget the parting day. 
SPOKEN.—Oeh hone! mavrone; 'twas a 
sorry day that 
ever I 
saw the like; and when my mother kern home, she 
sez to me, What the divil is the child cryim—crying for? I 
was just in from Mahony's with a 
quarter o'butter, when 
Dinny fell in the river and came home so dry that lie ate 
all the salt there was in the house to make him thirsty. 
Who should pop in the week before, but—What the divil 
is the matter wid me shoe? 
There's something in there be-
sides me foot. 
Aui! its no wonder I'm a 
poor widdy, wid 
me husband away to the salt say, and his poor little orphan 
childer crying, " Father, dear Father come home, sweet 
home, there's no place like any where else; but there's 
somtbin,,, in my shoe along wid me foot. 
I'll shake it out. 
Dance and sing. 
Since he stole away me heart, 
My beauty did depart, 
And I'm lonesome now my darlin's gone away.

IRISH GRASS WIDOW'S LAMENT—CONTINUED. 
We were married just a 
year, 
When a 
big ship did appear, 
And the Captain ' listed Dinny dear from me; 
lie used to send his pay in a 
letter ' cross the say," 
But the sorra letter now I 
ever see; 
" 
Vhaps he may be kilt, and his darlin blood be spilt 
Or scalped, or blown up in a 
bat-ter- lie; 
May be he's another wife and deserted me for life, 
But I'm lonesome since my darlin whit away. 
But he's gone, etc. 
SPOKEN.—My

lie was a 
bouncing, beautiful, bulky, baby-boy, 
a 
purty, pratling picture of his mother, barin his fair, fresh 
face favors his Father's flushed features. 
Some say he 
smiles sweetly; seldom sick, sore or sorry. Ile sings sweet, 
singular sounds of song. 
When he's ould enough, I 
will 
make him seek his Father. Och hone! Dinny, I 
wish I 
was 
a 
bird. 
Fa fly to you; I'd grab you by the top-knot, and 
drop you down. Oh Dinny, darlin, dadda's deserted 
Dimly, drive dirty donkeys, dare drown dry dogs, drink 
dripping dew drops, dine on dangers dishes, deliver di-
abolical clams to delicious dinners, draw dangerous dirks 
and darts, dance down deep dells? 
Quick Dance.

On a 
bright summer morning I 
pursued my way, 
As happy as a 
robin when he trills his lay, 
That morning such a 
letter from-my true love came, 
Commencing with " My Dearest," and concluding with her 
name. 
Such a 
pretty letter, with its perfume sweet, 
Cupid's with their arrows loving hearts to meet, 
Lots of blots for kisses, and a 
seal of blue, 
Meaning that my love is true to you. 
CHORUS. 
For on a 
bright summer morning I 
pursued my way, 
As happy as a 
robin when he trills his lay, 
That morning such a 
letter from my true love came, 
Commencing with " My Dearest," and concluding with her 
name. 
Now who the letter came from I 
of course must tell, 
A charming little maiden, and her name is Belle, 
She's just as sweet as honey, and she writes to me— 
You see that we are parted, she is far across the sea.' 
If you've ever been in love, of course you'll understand 
The feelings of my heart, when loving letters reach your band, 
I 
low you'll stand and wonder what your sweetheart she has said, 
As I 
did, with the one that I 
have read. 
For on a 
bright summer, & c. 
Of course I'm going to answer in a 
true love strain, 
And ask my little darling to return again, 
And soon a 
ship that's sailing o'er the dark blue sea, 
Will bring me such a 
letter, from my sweetheart it will be. 
Then when We are married, I 
will write you all the news, 
Tell you how we get along, and never have the blues, 
What a 
little treasure wife I 
got from o'er the sea, 
Our letters then will spell L- O- V- E. 
For on a 
bright summer, & c. 
Composed by Ned Talbot for J. E. Murphy, of Murphy k 
Mack. 
I 
went down to Goerck street 
To a 
nice little surprise party, 
And the charmer that I 
met there was 
The darling, Biddy McCarthy. 
Now Biddy was the finest girl, 
And tile amusement of the party, 
Says I, I'm surely dead in love 
With the darling, Biddy McCarthy. 
CHORUS. 
With me tra-la-lee, now don't you see, 
I'm gone on Biddy McCarthy.... 
(Repeat.) 
We danced the polka " mazourka," 
Likewise the dizzy lanciers, 
And as we moved around the floor 
We were two darling dancers. 
Says Biddy, sure I 
feel afraid 
That I'll have to shake the party, 
I 
says wait awhile until I 
smile, 
And I'll go home with you Biddy McCarthy. 
(Chorus.) 
As I 
went home to Biddy's house 
A 
laughing, talking, chatting, 
met her father at the door 
All out of breath a 
panting. 
Says he, now Biddy where did you get this, 
Did you get him at the party, 
Oh, yes, you honor was the reply 
From darling Biddy McCarthy. 
I 
am happy now, I 
have a 
cow, 
Likewise a 
pig and a 
daughter, 
I 
live in a 
cot in a 
shady spot 
Away across the water. 
My mother-in-law she calls on me, 
She is a 
roaring tartar, 
Her husband as well is like a 
bull, 
But I 
love my Biddy McCarthy.

POOR WHITE SLAVE. 
By HARRY BURNS. 
AIR— Slavery Days. 
31 
TOILING slowly, day by day, ' till his life has pass'd away 
And they give him scarcely room to lay his head; 
He drudges, morn and night, to earn his scanty bite; 
All his luxuries are water, scorn and bread. 
They never sing his praise 'cept on election days; 
And they often call him scoundrel, tramp or knave; 
All the world may keep him down with many a 
sullen frown— 
He is nothing only a 
poor white slave. 
CHORUS. 
No matter where it be still he never can be free; 
The poor will ever have to stoop and crave. 
His coat is ragged, tore, let us kick him from the door— 
He is nothing only a 
poor white slave. 
Great Beecher tells the poor they are well enough, he's sure, 
If they get but bread and water all the while. 
If ever there is a 
hell they'll chuck him in pell mell ; 
He will surely get the middle of the pile. 
We never look for joy, there's none for you or I; 
Still how our suffering hearts try to be brave ; 
How it makes the tear-drops fall when they tell us after all 
We are nothing only a 
poor white slave. 
No matter where it be, etc. 
Those with riches hold full sway for their millions gaineth day ; 
It has been our valiant legislator's boast, 
The slaves may put me in, but I'm sure 'twill be no sin, 
To always work for those who pay thE most; 
-Yet, still we can forgive, 'tis only while we live, 
When this mortal life .- passing at the grave; 
Then we'll surely bless the day we so often heard them say 
He is nothing only a 
poor white slave. 
— No matter where it be, etc.

There's an Italian kid just two years old, 
With eyes in the back of his head,

When the young one's hair is red ; 
Some have got no eyes, and some have got no nose, 
And a 
black and tan kid 
With an elephant hoof 
And forty-leven toes ; 
Some's dramatic, some's lunatic, 
One kid has a 
wooden ear, 
Another one, they call Napoleon, 
Drinks his barrel of lager beer. 
They'll rear and tare, 
And pull their hair, 
Until your nerves they shock, 
They'll scream and yell, 
A

The babies on our block.

Larry O'Leary, Esq., Teacher of the Terpsichorian Art. 
Dear Sir:—That's me —This. will introduce my son, Phelim 
Augustus Decanter O'Candlestick. ( How dye do sir?) 
I 
would most respectfully place his feet in your hands, for 
their improvement. 
Yours, Dennis De Brass O'Candle-
Stick. (To imaginary pupil). 
Young man, your father 
does me honor. 
I 
have desired a 
Candlestick for a 
pupil, 
and I'll polish you so bright that few can stand in your 
light in dancing. 
The class in round dances are about to 
form, so pay attention. (A 
waltz in imitation of pupils). 
And now Ladies and Gentlemen, as well es being a 
Daiwi no-
Master, I 
am a 
Philosopher. 
The poilosophy of dancing 
THE DANCING PHILOSOPHER—CONTINUED. 
is in moving the foot wid the assistance of the head. 
The 
head controls the foot, tho' some people's feet control the 
head. 
But the modus operandi of the pedal extremities is 
a necessary appendage to educational propensities. 
Take 
your partners and don't forget the changes. 
First four 
right and left; then the other way; then the same thing 
over again; then repeat; and you, club-foot MacCaffrey, 
stop tickling that lady's nose with the gas-pipe; tind to 
your brogues. 
Start 
together like sogers; 
fire away! 
(Polka). 
Here, Mac_Morris, go to the door and scrape the. 
mud from your shoes, and not on the carpet. 
Try the 
plain Polka; then glide into the Quadrille wid aise and 
grace; but, gentlemen, don't step on the ladies' bunions. 
Take your partners. 
I'll swing that good looking girl 
meself. 
Let that red-head lady with the flat nose, dance 
with that fine ould gentleman with the false head and the 
bald teeth. 
No! I 
mean visa versa. 
Keep your temper 
and partners, and remember, that in order to improve, you 
must keep as you are. 
And now, Ladies and Gentlemen, 
(to the front), I 
propose giving everybody here a 
practical 
lesson in the philosophy of dancing. 
When you go home 
to-nbrlit, put on a 
pair of bare-footed shoes—they're the 
handiest for the foot—step out on the carpet, and, after 
the lesson, you'll be actually surprised at the dancing you 
have—not learned. 
Now, Mr. Lysander MeGillighan, dis-
course a 
few sweet, discordant and musical measures, or, 
in the language of the poet, rasp us up an Irish Jig Dance.

James Gordon Bennett's Carpet Bag. 
Written and sung by America's Favorite Motto and Comic Vocalist, 
CHARLES H. 
DUNCAN. 
I'll sin.- you a 
ditty that I'm sure you'll say is witty, 
And before I'm done will cause you all to laugh. 
'Tis of a 
man of some renown, and a 
native of this town, 
Connected with an editorial staff. 
He went abroad, ' tis said, some damsel fair to wed, 
Whose Christian name, ' tis whispered round, was Mag. 
When he sailed for Liverpool, across the briny pool, 
In his left hand he held a 
carpet bag. 
I 
know ' twill be a 
task, an unpleasant thing to ask 
Your ears, but pray don't let your spirits flag, 
And I'll endeavor to explain, yes, each article will name 
I 
saw within James Gordon Bennett's bag. 
There was reports of the Brooklyn scandal, and a 
symphony 
wrote by Handel • 
Letters from the only girl he ever loved ; 
A 
pair of Harry Miner's dirty socks, wrapped in a 
note from 
" 
Sunset" Cox; 
A package of " queer " that some young gounoff shoved; 
Elizabeth Tilton's last confession, an article on secession, 
While tied up in Dr. Mary Walker's old suspenders 
\Vas a document rather suspicious, looking old and quite 
j 
udicious, 
Containing accounts of Senator Conkling's secret benders; 
Then a 
poem by deacon Smith, without either rhyme or pith ; 
A 
new-fangled way to play the game of tag; 
-1 picture of President Hayes lacing Victoria Woodhull's stays, 
I 
saw within James Gordon Bennett's bag. 
There was the long lost Charlie Ross with jack Aberle on a 
boss, 
Making love to Tennie Claflin on the sly; 
Old Ben Butler on a 
stump Potter's committee trying to pump, 
Senator Thurman he was chanting " Root hog or die.' 
Owney Geoghan he was caught doing things he hadn't ought, 
Billy Sexton with a 
broken billiard cue. 
He was stirring a 
pot of soup for a 
girl who had the croup, 
Who rejoices in the name of Duck-foot Sue; 
Muldoon the solid man he had joined a 
Scottish clan, 
Little Mack was holding Bonner's bobtail nag ; 
But what caused by brain to whirl was Pastor's Coney Island 
girl, 
Dancing the can-can in James Gordon Bennett's bag. 
I'll Bet You a 
Dollar You Don't, 
Sung with great success by EDWIN BARRY. 
Does any one know what I'm going to say ? 
I'll bet you a 
dollar you don't. 
If I 
lose the wager, will any one pay, 
I'll bet you a 
dollar you don't. 
Gay bachelors say they shall never take wives, 
For as each in his way to be happy contrives, 
They mean to keep single the rest of their lives. 
But I'll bet you a 
dollar they don't. 
Find an Irish election without any row, 
I'll bet you a 
dollar you don't, 
Or a 
sin l 
who objects to a 
mistletoe bough, 
I'll bet you a 
dollar you don't. 
Some years of experience teaches me this— 
That from seven to ninety both Mrs. and Miss 
May refuse you this ancient excuse for a 
kiss. 
But I'll bet you a 
dollar they don't. 
You may see vaccination a 
thing of the past, 
I'll bet you a 
dollar you don't. 
And heavy taxation abolished at last, 
I'll bet you a 
dollar you don't. 
You may see old John Bull dwindle down to a 
calf, 
And his provender nothing but foreigners' chaff. 
You may see all the ladies too quiet by half, 
But I'll bet you a 
dollar you don't. 
Some ignorant croakers wear visages long, 
Will you bet me a 
dollar they don't ? 
And say that to visit amusement is wrong, 
Will you bet me a 
dollar they don't ? 
Though to succor distress they can never afford, 
Above human vices they always have soared, 
Still somehow they know every move on the board, 
Will you bet me a 
dollar they don't ? 
A 
married man often tries to prove cock-o'-the-walk, 
But I'll bet you a 
dollar he don't. 
If he tries to sleep when his wife wants to talk, 
I 
shall bet him two dollars he don't. 
So all you young girls, please attend to this verse, 
And go and get married for better or worse, 
And two little armfuls you may have to nurse, 
Won't bet a 
dollar you don't. 
JUST OVER. 
Written and sung with great success by Miss FLORA MOORE. 
I 
came from Tiperary, 
A 
few short months ago, 
With spirits light and airy, 
I'm an emigrant you know, 
Pray let me ask yer pardon, 
Smile on me if yer please, 
For I 
came from Tiperary, 
So far beyant the seas. 
CHORUS. 
For I'm just over, just over, 
Just over from the old Country, 
Just over, just over, but Fli soon go back again. 
But now I'm going to leave ye, 
I'm going far away, 
I'm going to leave the land I 
love, 
That's dear America, 
I 
am going back to my birth- place, 
In that little Isle so green, 
The home of all true Irish, 
And the best place that I've seen, 
CHORUS. 
For I'm just over, just over, 
Just over from the old Country, 
Just over, just over, but 
soon go back again. 
By JERRY COLIAN. 
Recited at HARRY MINER'S Opening by 
NIURPITY. 
I 
once Of an Irish-man heard a 
story, 
lie was climbing a 
ladder in all his glory; 
Just as Paddy had got to the top, 
A German Jew Peddler near the ladder did stop. 
When some bricks dropped out of the Irish- man's hod, 
And struck Mr. Jew right square on the nod; 
The 'Hebrew had on a 
new silk hat, 
And of course, he was mad as the Devil at Pat. 
lie looked up at the Irish-man, and said 
What for you come so near break mine head? 
My hat is all smashed, vot I 
done mithout it? 
Dis country mit Irish-man ish crowded. 
Pat looks down from his perch, and said, 
I 
wish to the Lord I 
had broke your head; 
Or smashed the big nose on your face, 
You on of a 
lying, thieving race! 
You great big murthering thief of a 
Jew, 
But for your forefathers, the like of you, 
The Blessed Lord, so they tell 
Would be alive this day, and doing well! 
GUESS! 
If a 
sore-eyed Bull-frog should play the fiddle for green-
horn Canary Bird to dance a 
jig with the Bald Headed 
Eagle, how many lop-sided egg shells would it take to 
masticate a 
chew of tobacco? 
Give it up !

Sons of Erin's Isle. 
Title and music composed by PADDY M URPHY. 
Copyrighted by A. J. FISHER, 1879. 
We've heard marshal songs and songs of the sea; 
Love songs and comic songs, but they don't suit me. 
We love to sing of Ireland—sweet land of our birth— 
I'm Paddy, her son, and she's my mother earth. 
Oh Erin, my country it grieves us to see 
Our enemies prosper, and yet we are not free. 
We fight for other countries as through life we roam, 
When half of our fighting would free our old home. 
CHORUS. 
Then hurrah for the sons of Erin's Isle! 
Hurrah for the daughters, who on us do smile I 
A 
fig for her foes, where- ever they may be ; 
Three cheers for old Ireland and sweet liberty. 
Then arise, sons of Erin, and prove to the world 
The sunburst of freedom is once more unfurled. 
Be united like brothers, and join hand in hand, 
Then you'll drive the proud Saxon from off of our land 
Sure the land is the people's, and who dare to dispute 
The word of our maker— for he spoke the truth. 
Then desend from the hill, and arise from the glen, 
And once more the battle of freedom begin. 
Then hurrah, & c.

Vesey St., N. Y. 
In Scotland, Prance and Germany, 
Music you will hear, 
The Italian loves to play the harp, 
He plays so soft and clear. 
Sweet music always charms my ear, 
Wherever it may be, 
I 
love to hear Tom Moore's sweet songs, 
They have such harmony. 
CHORUS. 
I 
love music, I 
love singing, 
I 
love dancing--it's entrancing, 
I 
love babies, I 
love ladies, 
Yes, they're all the world to me. 
The Irish songs are soft and sweet, 
They harmonize so well, 
The Meeting of the Waters, 
Or the Emigrant's Farenioli. 
There's Bobby Burns, the great Scotch poet, 
Whose memory shall reign 
In Scotland where he lived and died, 
And honored was his name. ( Cher us.) 
In speaking of our poets great, 
There's one now whom I'll name, 
his praise is sung both far and near, 
lie's well known for his fame. 
'Tis of William Cullen Bryant I 
speak, 
Who Americans will adore, 
His works are read throuaboutthis world, 
From this to foreign shore. 
(Chorus.)

What Are You Up To, Jane? 
Sung by the Great Motto Vocalist, EDWIN BARRY, at Harrigan & Hart's 
Theatre Comique, Broadway, N. 
V. 
Mother Jones kept a 
snug little grocery storz. 
Mother Jones was obnoxious and plain, 
Mother Jones had a 
daughter both pleasing and fair, 
Whose sweet appelation was Jane. 
While the old one was serving tobacco or gin, 
I'd court pretty Jane on the sly, 
And oh, what sweet, glorious moments we'd have, 
Until the old woman would cry— 
What are you up to, 
I 
never knew such a 
chief again, 
What are you up to, 
I 
never knew such a 
chief again. 
CHORUS. 
Jane ? 
What are you up to, Jane ? 
girl in my life, you're up to your mis-
Jane ? now what you up to, Jane ? 
girl in my life, you're up to your mis-
One day I 
said, Jane, would you like to be married ? 
I 
fancy I 
should, said she, 
So one fine morning we bolted away, \ 
And got married upon the " Q. T." 
We went down to Rockaway, as Jane preferred 
The seaside for the honeymoon tour, 
Out at night we'd a 
fright as I 
pat out the light, 
A 
knock came at the bedroom door. 
SPOKEN.—And a 
voice through the key-hole said— 
What are you up to, Jane ? &c. 
Mother Jones was too late, for the bridal knot 
Was safely and securely tied, 
For ten years more from my mother-in-law, 
I 
kept at a 
distance wide. 
But she turned up again a 
few days ago, 
When we startled the old 'uns curls, 
With a 
great surprise for her dear old eyes, 
When we mustered the boys and girls. 
SPOKEN.—As our " blessings " came into the room two 
by- two, like a 
healthy boarding-school, the " old 'un 
dropped 
gracefully into the nearest coal scuttle, exclaiming— 
WIat are you up to Jane? &c.

Don't Forget a 
Friend. 
Written and sung by Charles H. Duncan. 
Copyrighted by 
George D. Newhall, Cincinnati. 
All through this world are many things 
That puzzle and perplex, 
And many of us find in life occurrences that vex. 
The high, the low, the rich, the poor, 
Meet equal in the end, 
Though some may sneer and put on airs, 
With what good luck may send, 
Yet he who takes us by the hand 
And wishes us success 
We'll not forget in future, though 
his fortune may grow less ; 
We'll try to aid him, cheer him 
Upward, onward to the end, 
For should reverses come to us 
He'll not forget a 
friend. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! don't forget a 
friend, 
Pray, don't forget a 
friend ; 
Let this your motto be through life, 
Pray don't forget a 
friend. [ Repeat.] 
The drunkard whom you pass with scorn 
Was once respected, too, 
And when a 
child, a 
mother's love 
He had, as well as you. 
When money filled his pockets 
I 
He was hail good fellow then, 
But now, that all his cash 
has flown, forgotten by most men. 
But now that all his cash has flown, 
Forgotten by most men. 
Let this a 
lesson be to you: 
Be temperate in all things, 
And give your fellowman a 
lift, 
Whom err misfortune brings, 
You cannot tell from day to day 
What others they may seno. 
Let this your motto be through life 
Pray don't forget a 
friend. 
Chorus. 
Parody on " Sandy-Haired Mary in our Area," as sung by 
HARRIGAN & HART. 
Written by EDWIN TALBOT.-
I 
board at Mrs. Reilly's, 
I 
have a 
big back room; 
There's a 
little Italian fairy, 
That has me gone to ruin. 
Her name is Katy Brady, 
And every night at eight; 
Sweet sounds of music, 
By our Red-Haired Kate. 
CHORUS: 
I'm her daisy, she's my love, 
She ain't the only one I 
love, 
She's a 
gem, yes, she is silly, she's airy; 
She's a 
cake, don't mistake, 
She'll be Mrs. Brogan yet, 
Dear Red-Haired Katy so contrary. 
See smiles at every Peeler, 
Traveling on the Street; 
The Ash-man in the morning, 
He has such awful feet. 
The Tarrier keeps the Grocery, 
He swears he will her mate; 
And hugs her, yes, the rascal, 
Contrary Red-Haired Kate. 
I'm her dnr5,, etc. 
53: 
RED-HAIRED KATY SO CONTRARY—CONTINUED. 
The man who carries banners, 
The old Hibernian Clown; 
He hollers in the alley, 
For Katy to come down. 
It makes me nearly looney, 
To see her start a 
gait; 
To smile upon the 'farrier, 
With the Red-Haired Pate. 
I'm her daisy, etc. 
The Junk-man and the Tailor, 
The Beggar for his Bread; 
The Bummer and the Bruiser, 
Have nearly killed me dead. 
A 
crazy Cabinet-maker, 
Has broken me heart complate; 
He elopes with her next Tuesday, 
My darling Red- Haired Kate. 
CHORUS: 
I'm her daisy, she's my love, 
She ain't the only one I 
love, 
She's a 
gem, yes, she's silly, she's airy; 
She's a 
cake, don't mistake, 
She'll be Mrs. Brogan yet, 
Dear Red- Haired Katy so contrary. 
Widow Dunn (Parody). 
Sung by Billy Carter. 
Dedicated to Harrington and Hart. 
I 
know a 
big fat widow, 
That keeps a 
livery stable, 
A making beds for horses that are sick, 
She's an awful early riser, 
And a 
champion appetizer, 
Like an eight-day clock 
She goes around on tick. 
She's from the country poor-house, 
Her husband was a 
tramp, 
In the English army he did beat a 
drum, 
And for singing tar-heeled Hanna's, 
Or murdering sick pianos, 
There's no marker for the big fat Widow Dunn. 
CHORUS. 
She is hunky, she is chunky, 
She's as handsome as a 
monkey, 
She's a 
fairy, she's contrary, 
She's a 
lamb, Ir. mean a 
ham, 
She's as tall as any ladder, 
I'd slug her if I 
had her, 
And kick the chest protector off the Widow Dunn. 
WIDOW DUNN (PARODY).— CoNTINITED. 
She steals the morning papers 
Away from every door, 
She's an acrobactic, break-neck son of a 
gun, 
And at every wake or funeral, 
She goes to sing and dance, 
Such a 
tender creature is the widow Dunn. 
She's freckled, but she's pretty, 
And well developed feet, 
She has one back tooth that weighs a 
half a 
ton, 
And at every passing stranger 
She tires an ancient egg, 
So familiar is the Widow Dunn. 
CHORUS. 
She is moody, she is sankey, 
She's consumptive, she is crankey, 
She's rheumatic, she's lunatic, 
She's a 
bum, she weighs a 
ton, 
She is crazy, she is careless, 
She is toothless, she is hairless, 
Such a 
chromo is the big fat Widow Dunn. 
A IR : " Pretty as a 
Picture." 
Words by BENNETT and FILSON, and sung by them amid roars of applause 
Filson—Oh, my lung is gone since I 
took that horn, 
Such a 
darling girl waited on me 
She looked like a 
star when behind the bar, 
And her hair was the color of clay. 
Such a 
lovely nose, ' twas like a 
rubber hose, 
And her mouth was as wide as the Hudson. 
Such a 
delicious breath, it was certain death 
To the man that buzzed her long. 
She's as handsome (Sym.) 
As a 
funeral, ( 
Sym.) 
And her voice was like a 
whistle in a 
tug- boat. 
She's my only girl, (Sym.) 
With such a 
lovely curl, ( Sym.) 
She's as handsome as the cobwebs on the wall. 
CHORUS. 
(Spa.) 
For my darling's sake I 
my life would take 
just as freely as I 
would a 
bedbug's ; 
Such a 
lovely maid with teeth just like a 
spade, 
That I 
met down by the brook. 
(Biz., 
Bennett— Oh my feet are sore and my clothes are tore 
Since a 
cross-eyed girl has shook me ; 
Such a 
freckled face, teeth out of place, 
That I 
met down by the bay. 
Oh her liver lip, how it used to flip, 
When she tried to talk Italian, 
And her Spanish shoes, number thirty- twos, 
Would cover up the whole sidewalk. 
She's so lazy, (Sym.) 
And she's so crazy, (Sym.) 
And her voice was like a 
fish-horn on a 
Friday. 
She's Presumptive, (Sym.) 
And she's consumptive; ( Sym.) 
And her mouth would cover up a 
good size sewer. ( Biz) 
For my darling's sake, &c.

Dat the boys and girls were always sure to dance, 
And when the ' picaninny nigs" would turn upon dar heels 
De ole man would join dem in dar merry prance; 
Tho' he used to give us blows when among de cotton rows, 
lie was kind to us when daily toil was o'er, 
And eb'ry one dat worked upon the old plantation knows 
his heart was bigger dan our sunny shore. 
(C/torus). 
We have heard he joined de army after sending us away 
And was killed in battle down in Tennessee, 
And some one else has told us dat dey heard ole missus say 
Ile was sleeping ' neath de ole Palmetto'tree; 
H de last report is so, all of us would gladly go 
And shed upon his grave a 
friendly tear, 
For eber since we left him we have felt the keenest woe, 
Dar's nothing for de worn out darkey here.

In my little old log cabin in the lane. 
[here was a happy time to me not many years ago, 
When tlit darkies used to gather round the door, 
[hey used io sing and dance at night, and play the old ban,its. 
But alas, they cannot do it any more; 
The hinges are all rusty now, the door is tumbling down, 
And the roof lets in the sunshine and the rain, 
Oh I 
the only friend that's left me is that little boy of mine, 
In my liti le old log cabin in the lane.

You have seen white folks that were hialitoned, 
But we leave them in the shade, 
We always grab on the latest style, 
Of the finest clothes that's made. 
You should see when we go to church, 
how all dem wenches smile, 
We look so cute dey all salute, 
These nigs that put on style. 
CHORUS. 
All the coons and wenches 
Look at us and smile, 
When us they see they do agree, 
We're de nigs dat put on style. 
You should see us waltzing for a 
prize 
At the colored waiters' dance, 
We have clean boiled shirts and white neckties, 
And piccadilly pants. 
De nigs all look astonished 
At our bran new clothes and tile, 
We look like colored Congressmen, 
We're de nigs dat put on style.

As sung everywhere by the originals, CUMMINGS and HINES. 
Oh we've just come out to tell you all, 
We see you're looking gay, 
We're going to run for Congressmen

And if you will but lend a

Of course we'll never tell, 
For we are known by every one 
As the dandy colored swells. ( Bus.)

Oh yes, we are two political coons,

We're going to run for Congressmen 
On next election day ; yes we are, you bet. 
And now, kind friends, we've done our best 
To try and please you all, 
When we sit in the NN'hite House 
Or in the Congress hall. 
And if ,ve meet some other day, 
NVe hope to find you well, 
For we are known by every one 
As the dandy colored swells. 
Oh yes, we are, &c.,

sad K 
for Knave, and numbers 1, 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
four rows, and are to be read according to directions. 
Many of the an-

method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under.

+Courting Cards.— This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means ol 
expressing one's sentiments in such P. way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by 
titlemen who are either too diffis 
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentum, 
question. 
The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unladylike encourage-
, 
tnent. 
As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged-and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. 
This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi. 
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes a 
further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties

It is a Fac simile of a Trick practiced by all 
time Professors of _Magic. 
It is arranged so systematically, and is accom-
panied with directions so plainly written, that, with 
a 
single perusal, any person may become an adept 
in an unfailing source of amusement. 
Read what a leading Journal says of it: 
"Au ingenious little book of the thaumaturgic order 
has been sent us, called HUMPTY DIIMPTY,' and bound 
in such a 
way as to give opportunity for a 
decidedly 
puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary appear-
auce of a 
child's picture-book, gayly printed and colored, 
it is so bound that a 
practiced manipulator, taking it 
up, and flirting the leaves rapidly over, can make it ap-
pear to be filled with copies of only one picture, or with 
blank pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of 
figures. 
One minute the pamphlet, quickly thumbed, 
appears to contain nothing but portraits of Harlequin, 
in his tesselated suit; the next, only Columbine ; then, 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or Mephisto-
pheles. 
A little practice, and . the directions printed 
with the book will make anybody at home in the hand-
ling of it."—Phila. Evening Bulletin.
