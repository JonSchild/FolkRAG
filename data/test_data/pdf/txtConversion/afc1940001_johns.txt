JohnnyOh, Johnny'd been on sea and Johnny'd been on shore,He went to a tavern where he had
been before."Oh, how do you do! Johnny, how do you do!Last night my daughter Polly was dreaming
of you."Oh, what luck, Johnny, oh, what luck at sea?""Immaterial," said Johnny, "bring down your
daughter dear.Bring down your daughter Polly and sit'er on my knee,We'll drown all melancholy
and merry we will be.""Oh, Polly's not at home, John, she'll not be home today,She's gone to a
neighbor's engaged for to stay.Oh, Polly's getting rich and, Johnny, you are poor,If Polly were at
home, John, she'd turn you out of door."Then Johnny was sleepy and he hung down his head,He
asked for a candle to light him up to bed."Our clean beds are full a fortnight or moreOf handsome
young strangers and, Johnny, you are poor.""Then how much do I owe you and down it shall be
laid,How much do I owe you and down it shall be paid.""Oh, four and twenty schillings, John, the
new and the old."And Johnny pulled out his two hands full of gold.The sight of that money made the
old woman stare,The sight of that money made the old woman stare."Oh, you, you are in earnest,
John, but I was but in jest,You and my daughter Polly will happy be at last."Polly observing and
downstairs she ran,She caught him in her arms crying, "How do you do, John!Oh, how do you do!
Johnny, you're welcome home from sea!Our clean beds are empty, dear Johnny, for thee.""I want
none of your clean beds, my gold's laid up in store,I want none of your clean beds, my gold's laid
up in store.So fare-you-well, my pretty Polly, [that?] old jade your mother;My gold and my silver
I'll spend with some other."Come all you young sailors who plow the raging main,Who work for
your money through hail, sleet and rain.Take care of it all and lay it up in store,For wit/hout that fair
companion they'll turn you from the door."

sailed to LondonWhere he had been before."What luck, what luck, young Johnny?What luck have
you had at sea?""I have had very poor luck,"Young Johnny said to me."Call down your daughter
Polly,And sit her on my knee.Call down your daughter PollyAnd sit her on my knee;And we'll drown

if she was at home,She'd turn you out of doors,For, young Johnny, she is rich,And you are very
poor."Young Johnny looked around,He looked upon them allAnd then he began his rec'nings for
to call:It's thirty shillings of the new,And forty of the old;Double handfuls of gold and silver he
drew.Down came her daughter Polly,All with a smiling face.She threw her arms around him,So
sweetly did embrace,Saying, 'You're welcome home, young Johnny,You're welcome home from
sea."For the green bed is empty,And you shall lie there.""Before I'd lie there, I'd lie in the street[,?]And
if I had no money, my lodging I might seek.But now I have got money,I will make the tavern hurlWith
a bottle of good brandyAnd on my knee a girl." 1 Page 1. [8E-B1?] YOUNG JOHNNY THE SAILOR.

My own invention.And now for the song.

LondonWhere he has had been before.
