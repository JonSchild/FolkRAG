St. Jacobs Oil. 
Sung by Norton and Knowles. 
About a 
famous remedy there is excitement great, 
It's advertised and spoken of in every town tuci state. 
It will cure a 
gumbile on your nose, 
Or a 
bunion on your head. 
"Twill bring you back to life again, 
After you ye been dead, 
"fw ill cure you of a 
scolding wife, 
And Wake her hold her jaw, 
"Twill cure the baby of the er up, 
A 
ad kill your mother-in-law. 
It's made of four lea\ ed shamrocks 
That grew in ' rexas soil, 
And they don't see snakes in Ireland, 
Since they used St. Jacobs Oil 
John Kelly ussd a 
bottle to silvcr plate his gall, 
And now he carries on his shoulders 
The whole Of Tammany Hall. 
Mary Walker used it wften she -tut on her brother's pants, 
And Beecher u.ied it when he kissed, 
His cousins and his aunts, 
Sarah Bernhardt used a 
bottle 
Now she is the fat woman riding on Jumbo, 
On the bosom of his pants, 
Owney Gecglian had a 
boil, 
He now sits down without stfinding up, 
Since he used St. Jacobs oil.

Wst, Say Nothing At All. 
Sung by .11crton k 
Knowles. 
How very peel-dial the young ladies dress, 
Wst, say nothing it al ; 
A man from a 
woman one scarcely can guess, 
Wst, say nothing at all. 
With their long ulster coats, 
And their small derby hats, 
And the latest of slan 
too, they have down quite fine, 
Our pantaloons next, they'll be aiming at, 
But wst, say nothing at all. 
The Mormons in Utah have ninety-nine wives, 
Wst, say nothing at all; 
All the male Mormons must lead quiet lives, 
Wst, say nothing at all, 
Each wife has a 
mother, goodness, that's tough, 
And ninety-nine mother- in-laws, 11 averts that's rough, 
Mott men think that one is more than enough, 
But wst, say nothing at all. 
Of the girls on the flowery now I 
will speak, 
Wst, say not Ii ng at all; 
They are out at all hours every night in the week, 
Wst, say nothing at ail 
Of course they are happ .
1, and free 1
.ruin all cares, 
But they get boiling full and they fall uy the stairs, 
I 
wonder if ever they do say their prayers, 
But wst, Lay nothing at all. 
Since the Railroads Have Cut

By Dan F. Morton. 
sung by

A 
terrible excitement we've not:ced of late, 
And Nev.' York has been turned inside out; 
There are extra news papers and lots of small talk, 
By the young and the old and the stout 
Faro banks on the flowery have stopped paying checks, 
The Tombs have closed up for repairs, 
Mrs. Labouchere hit Oscar Wide in the ear, 
Since the railroads have cut down the fare. 
If n

Along with some charming yoeng miss, 
Down at OF, tombs you'll b., sent up for five years. 
If the paint oft her cheeks you should kiss.

The Madhouse in the Air. 
By chutes It. Duncan. 
Sung by Norton and Knowles. 
I 
had a 
dream t e 
other night, 
The queerest e'er I 
laid, 
I 
dreamt that every one on earth 
Went raving staring mad 
They were all shut up together, 
In a 
madhouse in the air. 
And I 
nearly died with laughter, 
At the sights that I 
saw there. 
They did all sorts of funny things, 
They never did before. 
Some thought that they were animals, 
And loudly they did roar, 
Some were sad, while some were gay, 
They'd laugh, they'd scream, they'd glare, 
So I'll tell you all the sights I 
saw, 
In the madhouse in the air. 
Jac Aberle he came in a 
sealskin vest to buy, 
When he got struck with a 
datLaged sock, 
And then lay down to die. 
Salvini tried to do a 
clog, 
Upon the edge of the roof. 
When he got struck right b.;,g in the ear, 
With a 
crazy horse's hoof, 
Lester Walla& played a 
jewsharp, 
THE MADHOUSE IN THE AIR. 
Co:. TIN LED 
John McCullough done a 
jig, 
Lawrence Barrett went in training 
For an educated jig. 
Kate GaXit n 
was the foreman 
Of the fire brigade up there, 
And Be cher preached for a 
dollar a 
day, 
In the madhouse in the air 
Tony Pastor tried a 
trapeze act, 
But he done a 
fundy fall, 
Pat Rooney wore pink dominoes, 
At the Coney Island Ball, 
Adah Richmond played Juliet, 
To the Romeo of Sam Devere, 
While Harrigan and Hart with Edwin Booth, 
Played seven up for beer. 
Gus Williams joined Mrs Langtry, 
And Italian opera sung, 
Ilaverley started a 
female party 
With the \vidows of Brigham Young, 
Bob Ingersoll said there was no hell, 
But he got an awful scare, 
When he introduced the Sun•'ay law, 
In he madhouse in the air.

Go to Sleep my Little Darling 
Published by permission of COLLINS ct BUXTON, Portland, W. 
Go to sleep, my little darling, 
Rest on mother's loving breast, 
And the angels will protect you 
When within your cradle rest; 
Far above the starry heavens, 
They are looking down on you, 
So repose, my precious darling, 
Close your tiny eyes of blue. 
CHORUS. 
Go to sleep, my little darling, 
Rest your head on mother's brea* 
And the angels will protect you, 
When within your cradle rest. 
Far a-down the dewy meadow? 
All the daises are asleep, 
And the birdies in the branches 
Also are in slumber deep. 
But in Eden far above us, 
Angel eyes are open wide, 
And you are as safe, my darling, 
, Ls if they were at your side. 
Go Vz• sleep 
In the early morning, darling, 
Little robin in the tree 
Will awake you from your slumber, 
When ne dings his merry glee. 
Then I'll take you to my bosom, 
Till the glimmer on the plain 
Tells us that the sun is shining, 
And the day fias come again.

in Summer time I 
love to stroll, 
flowers rich and rare; 
And gather daisies white and gold; 
That blossom here and there; 
some people love to pass the hours, 
Out on the lake so clear; 
But I 
prefer to gather flowers, 
That grow in fields so near. 
Ctionus: 
Love among the flowers white and gold, ( Sym). 
There our happy tales of love unfold; (Sym). 
Oh, what joy it is to ramble through the wildwood 
With a 
pretty little maiden, young and fair; 
And gather flowers as we did in childhood, 
To weave them in her braids of golden hair. 
There stands a 
cot not far from here, 
At least it seems to me; 
Where dwells the one I 
love most dear, 
My blue eyed Carrie Lee; 
I 
met her in the flower-decked field, 
One evening clear and calm, 
I 
did not wait or hesitate, 
But offered her my arm.

Parody on Leaving the Old Folks. 
Written by BILLY LESTER, and sung by PAUL ALLEN, ESQ. 
I 
am leaving now the Poor-House, to go I 
know not 
where, 
I 
am leaving it in sorrow and disgust; 
I've eight million in my pocket I 
stole from Viola 
Clifton, 
To try and get a 
date I 
know I 
must; 
I've a 
pocketful of gags and encores I 
bought from 
Sarah Bernhardt, 
I've been a 
tramp for over seven years; 
could start a 
penny lodging house under the Fifth 
Avenue Hotel, 
And let people sleep in the drums of my ears. 
Cuouus: 
Then I 
am leaving now the Poor-House, I 
am trans-
ferred to the Coliseum, 
For trying to guy a 
couple of musical mokes; 
If I 
catch Niles & Evans stealing Eddie Booth's 
Dialect, 
I'll make them a 
present of John T. Kelly's jokes. 
Adam and Eve, From Lum and Bud Granger were 
with a 
fly by night, 
They played to eighty cents in Kankakee; 
They done a 
nice big four act with the Arnold 
Brothers from Texas, 
And statue essence with the J 
called Andy McKee 
Hyde & Behman done a 
waltz-jig along with Billy 
Emmet, 
Poor Paul Allen couldn't dance, his foot was sore; 
But yet he is a 
darling, he is mashed on Charlotte 
Banks, 
He is the pretty boy that came from Baltimore

DRAW IT MILD, 
Written and sung by W ILLIAM SCANLAK, 
Let's learn to temper our wishes, 
For there's many a 
thing we desire, 
Which on the morrow is worthless, 
And makes nature a 
vivid satire. 
Young men whose fathers are wealthy, 
In dissipation their hours do beguile; 
Get all you can from the old man, 
But remember draw it mild. 
For those who wish to be inuch in life, 
My advice, to man, woman or child, 
Is, go it strong while you are young, 
But remember, draw it mild. 
To the blushing maid of sweet sixteen, 
At whom Cupid flings his dart, 
Love at first sight's not always right, 
And leads to an aching heart. 
To all who believe in passion divine, 
And on whom the fates have smiled; 
Love's filter use, but don't abuse, 
And remember, draw it mild. 
To all who would an evil shun, 
Be he defaulter or politician ; 
Honor or duty can't be bought. 
o 
give up sordid ambition. 
Or else like evil doers, 
Upon whom riches are piled; 
A day of recovery soon will come, 
Unless you draw it mild. 
To those, etc. 
To those, etc.

Oh it NV:_L:-; a 
line picture a 
painter might draw, 
From the ! tureen beyant in the corner. 
It was putty without, it was tidy within, 
On the shelves, shone like silver, our plate made of tin, 
Which cast some reflections when sturlight stole in, 
On the dog and the cat in the corner; 
Of bacon, galore, we had many a tlitell in, 
The witL-mouthed chimney, that yawned in the kiteuen, 
Oh twoubl malce your mouth water, and eager to phalli. 
To the lames that hung high in the corner. 
Aud there by the tire my mother would knit, 
And close to her side my mild father would sit, 
What stories he'd tell when his dud en was lit, 
While he smoked away in the corner; 
tilten supper was over the neighbors dropped In, 
API by tile turf lire each roasted his shin, 
.kv ,PQ 
the boys and the girls ne'er thought it a 
sin 
Vor to hug and to kiss in the corner. 
Whc.r. Jimmy, the piper, walked in on the boon, 
The young people : kit made a 
rush for the door 
Dragging Jimmy along to the barn and sure 
They placed him high up in the coriter; 
Then at it they wimit, dear, with lwaits light and gay, 
And danced the night hours into the young day, 
'Tilt Jimmy got drunk an' no longer could play, 
'to lay pipes and all in the corner.

Always Speak A Kind Word When 
You Can. 
Originally sung by W ILL H. 
M ORTON, America's Comique, at the Park 
Novelty Theatre, Brooklyn. 
New sayings arc all the rage on the street and on the stage 
And many a 
glorious maxim you may find, 
lint there's one more than the rest seems to linger in my 
breast, 
And often comes a 
floating o'c r 
my mind, 
will tell you here to-night this motto true and bright, 
A 
lesson it conveys sublime and grand, 
To the beggar at your door, to all people rich or poor, 
Always speak a 
kind word when you can. 
Now if perchance you meet an ole, friend upon the street, 
lie is pt)or and all the world may sneer at him, 
Oh, do not pass him by in despair to live or die, 
But remember that his povAly is no sin, 
Then help him with a 
will, show that you respect him still, 
Welcome him and grasp Lim by the haLd, 
Do not turn your head away, but remember what I 
say, 
Always speak a 
kind word when you can. 
There's many and many a 
man who no riches can command, 
Yet he may be the noblest of them all, 
Many a 
glorious deed he's done, many a 
victory he has won, 
Yet his honors and rewards are very small, 
But when he's dead and gone, his loss they deeply mourn, 
He's a 
monument of friends on every hand, 
And his praises tkey relate when they know it is too late, 
For they never speak a 
kind word when they can.

Still my mem'ry will steal o'er 
To dat dear old Cabin floor, 
When de shadow of de sun came peeping in: 
At night. when all was dark, 
We would hear de watch-dog bark, 
And we'd listen to the murmur of the wind. 
It seem to say to me. 
"You people must be free," 
For de happy time am coming, Lord be praised! 
For then we would weep and moan, 
For our souls was not our our own, 
In dem agonizing, cruel slay'ry _days. 
3 I 
am very old and feeble, 
And our 'life am nearly done; 
I 
have travell'd in the roughest kind of road; 
Through sickness, toil and Eorrow 
I 
have reach' de end at last, 
And I'm resting by de wayside wid my load. 
Forget now and forgive, 
Has always been my guide, 
For dat's what de scripture surely says; 
But our mem'ry will turn roun, 
When our souls dey were tied down, 
In dem agonizingu cagill slay'ry days.

hits at Harry Miner's Eighth Avenue Theatre, 
New York. 
--:0 : 
In a 
tenement house, where we reside, 
Mid the bustle of this great and crowded city, 
Lives a 
maiden neat and sweet, 
Who's as modest as sho's pretty; 
On fine Sundays strolling through the park, 
I 
roam with this dainty bell; 
No high-toned lady can compare 
To my modest Irish Nell. 
CHORUS: 
Modest Irish Nell, 
You I 
love so well, 
Maiden with soul so pure and true, 
In my heart you dwell, 
Will you love me, tell? 
And through life I'll roam with you. 
Married now are we and settled down, 
I 
live happy with this fair and loving creature, 
We've got two children now, 
Like my Nell, they're as pretty as a 
picture. 
I 
live happy with my darling bride, 
As in peace and love we dwell, 
I 
bless the day that I 
was wed 
To my modest Irish Nell.

ERIN'S EMBLEMS. 
BUTTERCUPS AND DAISIES. 
Written and Composed by W. H. DELEHANTY. 
I 
wear two lovely emblems, 
United on my breast, 
The honored " Harp of Erin," 
That land I 
love the best. 
A 
darling treasured " Shamrock," 
So modest to be seen. 
That Harp that shines with glory, 
The Shamrock so fair and green. 
CHORUS. 
My blessings on those emblem.: 
Of Erin across the sea. 
May they adorn the banners 
Proclaiming Ireland free. 
The reason why I 
wear them, 
So closely to my heart, 
Those gems of priceless treasure, 
-United never to part, 
Because that little Shamrock, 
Was fair and pure to see, 
The Harp was like the utterings, 
Of mother love to me. 
My blessing on those_ 
My mother wrought that gold harp, 
With tresses of her hair; 
green threads of father's jacket, 
Did make a 
Shamrock fair. 
My father kissed and blessed me 
Before I 
crossed the sea, 
And bade me wear those emblems, 
"ior mother dear and me."

Pointing to the daisies silver wealth untold, 
Buttercups unnumbered, these she said were gold. 
With the time departing soon the air was chilled, 
Out upon the crisp wind loud the robin thrilled, 
Onc -2 
again I 
wandered with my little maid, 
To our treasure garden vast in wealth arrayed, 
Soon we knew a 
robber, Jack Frost was his name,

grasp so cold 
Stole our silv( r 
daises and buttercups of gold. 
Man's estate I 
reached then, but I 
ne'er forgot 
My little maid companion and our treasure spot, 
For there was a 
lesson in our strange belief, 
Summer was our banker. Winter Was our thief, 
So it is with friends, then sometimes so with all, 
They're true to us in sunshine hut leave us in the fall, ,

Sweet-Scented Handsome Young Man. 
(Yew air.) 
Written and composed by SAM DEVERE, and sung by him 
with immense success. 
Copyrighted 1876, by A. 
J. 
FISHER, CS Nassau St., New York. 
There's a 
sweet- scented handsome young man in this town, 
his name is Thoophilus Aristides Brown. 
With weak-minded females he's gained some renown, 
This sweet- scented handsome young man. 
He's as dainty as a 
butterfly, and in colors as gay, 
And flutters from corner to corner all day. 
He's too sweet for anything, that's what the girls say, 
Of this sweet- scented handsome young man, 
CHORUS. 
He wears a 
red neck- tie, his complextion is fair, 
Straight down from the middle he parts his blonde hair. 
He skips o'er the gutter like a 
thing made of air, 
This sweet- scented handsome young man. 
There's a 
few straggling hairs upon his upper lip, 
His legs are the size of a 
two cent tallow dip, 
He looks like a 
chicken that's just had the pip, 
This sweet- scented handsome young man. 
If caught in the rain he would surely expire, 
Gotten up expressly for girls to achnire, 
He could jump through a 
sieve without touching a 
wire, 
Could this sweet- scented handsome young man. 
Ile wears a 
red neck tie, ie. 
To break the girls' hearts is his object ' twould seem, 
By day its his hobby, by night its his dream; 
His chief food is sponge cake, root beer and ice cream, 
This sweet-scented dainty young man. 
Such efliminate young 111011 may be all very fine, 
Their attention all clear headed girls will decline 
I'll be darn'd if he could marry any sister of mine, 
o 
such sweet-scented handsome young man. 
Ile wears a 
red neck tie, &C.

Here we are, two light-licar:ed Irishmen, 
We hold our heads as hig* as any in the land, 
We shun all Irish like l'at Rooney ; we want you to um

We're foremen on the Elevated Road.

We keep our men to work, and never let them set

Every morn at eight o'clock we get them all together, 
'Tis then we call the roll, in wet or shiny weather ; 
It makes but little difference— they're all as tough as 
leather, 
Are the laborers on the Elevated Road. 
At half-past five at night, ' tis then that we get done, 
To our wives and c:tildren home we very quickly run ; 
They say my boy is like his father— the little son of a

Oh, oh, we're proud foremen on the Elevated

I 
have a 
darling whom I 
adore, 
When he is near I 
am sighing no more; 
Lone are the hours when we are apart, 
Fondly his image now dwells i2 my heart. 
Sweet hours of gladness we pass side by side, 
Waiting the day when I'll be his bride; 
Dearly he loves me, but never in vain, 
Soon he is coming to kiss me again. 
Claws. 
Kiss me again and say that you love me, 
Ever my darling remain; 
Kiss me again, and if I 
complain, 
Say that you love me and kiss me again. 
Sweet is the kiss that lovers can share, 
flow it will cheer you and banish all care 
Never refuse one; never be shy, 
Don't be too bashful and scream out " Oh, my!" 
Kisses are plenty and kisses are sweet, 
When you take one the dose you'll repeat; 
If with your lov'ci one you'd always remain, 
Come to his side and say, " kiss me again l" 
Kiss me again, etc.

I 
spoon a 
girl named Mary Ann, a 
tender little dove, 
Who costs me lots of half- pence, and a 
precious deal of love; 
She's living with her mother, as a 
maiden ought to do, 
And looks as straight and proper as a 
saint, or me or you. 
Rut somellow when I 
trot her round, no matter where we go, 
I'm struck with all the people that this maiden seems to 
know ; 
For certain as Mary Ann I 
proudly take about, 
Some heads pop round the corner, and a 
vulgar voice will 
shout— 
Cuottus: 
Oh, very well, Mary Ann, I'll tell your Mn, 
She little thought when you came out you'd go so far; 
I'm sure your mother doesn't know the girl you are, 
Mary Ann, tie! for shame, Yalt! yah! yah ! Oh! yah! 
We went last Whitsua Monday to the forest by the rail, 
We did the thing first class of course, at that I 
never fail, , 
tipp'd the guard a 
shilling, or what you might call a 
bob, 
To lock us in a 
carriae and preserve us from the mob. 
We sat on downy cushions and the curtains drew for fun, 
For Polly said her pretty eyes they could not bear the sun; 
But when we settled snugly and were just about to go, 
A. head came through the window and a 
fellow shouted— 
(Chorus). 
ez1., 
FAREWELL, ALANNA. 
MARY ANN, 
I'
LL TELL YOUR MA .—CONTINUED 
We wander'd through the forest glades as happy as could be, 
We thought from vulgar people there, we should at least 
be free; 
We sought a 
sweet 
could hear, 
And whisper'd those soft, silly things, that lovers think so 
dear. 
We sat beneath a 
spreading oak, our loving arms entwined, 
While I 
was fond and foolish, she was gentle, sweet and 
kind; 
But just as I 
my passion told, and sealed it with a 
kiss, 
A chap birds-nesting up above, so rudely shouted this— 
(Chorus). 
We came away disgusted, and we quickly made for home, 
For everywhere we met the cry, no matter where we'd 
roam; 
My Mary Ann declared to me she knew those people not, 
In fact, she said she would not mix with such a 
vulgar lot. 
But on this precious mystery I 
have some little doubt, 
And almost think that Mary Ann mustInow her way about ; 
Fur when we parted at her door, or rather just inside, 
&. voice came down the staircase, and her little brother 
secluded spot, where none our vows

Vhis world is but a ) 111)ble, there's nothing here hut woe,

For, at the hest, this world is but a

We are t.ossed upon the sea of life, just like a 
little boat, 
Where some get cast upon the rocks, and never gel afloat ; 
But still well do the best we can, and never let despair 
Usurp the place between us and our castles in the air 
rhere's a 
name known o'er the world, to Engliahtnen tnostt 
dear, 
And well may they be proud of him, their native bard, 
Shakespeare; 
When first his plays came on the stage, they made the whole 
world stare, 
Ara yet they were composed while budding castles in the air. 
If you take the words of Shakespeare, and study them well 
through, 
You'll find each saying is so wise, each sentiment so true— 
They make you feel, while reading them, as if you had been 
there ; 
Yet, the immortal Shakespeare built his castles in the air 
The Irish had their poet, too ; they loved him well, I'm stye;

Ohl we've parted from each other, 
And our cream of love is o'er, 
That bright dream was too beautiful to last 
And we'll meet as only strangers, 
In the future evermore, 
Our once tender love is buried in ti e 
past. 
Tho' I've tried to bear the blow, 
Without sighs or bitter tears, 
And tried to smile when my heart ached with pain. 
Yet the burning tears would fall, 
In spite of all that I 
could do, 
For the darling one I 
ne'er shall see again. 
CHORUS. 
My dream of love is o'er, 
I 
try to smile when my heart aches with pain; 
But the memory of the past comes up before 
Me like a 
dream, for the darling one I 'der shall soo 
again. 
Ohl they say you love another, 
Who has claimed you for his bride. 
And you wish me to forgive and to forget; 
All the vows we pledged together,

As I 
looked into your beauteous eyes—my pet. 
AhI the heart is like the tides,

So, thro' all the future years,

HAPPY LITTLE CHILDREN FROM THE

As sung by SEAMON and SOMERS. 
Words by II ARRY BENNETT, 
Music by BILLY CARTEn. 
KEEP your eyeA upon 114, children from the South, 
We're as merry as the little birds singing on the trees: 
Our hair's so tight we cannot shut our mouth, 
And we're always just as happy as can be. 
Clionus. 
Then, dancing, laughing. jumping all the day, 
Music makes us foolish as the chickens in the hay. 
Then singing, shouting, to pass the time away, 
We're two happy little children from the South. 
When us darkeys we give a 
fancy ball, 
They watch us niggers as we promenade the hall ; 
Singing, dancing, we can beat them all. 
For we're two happy litttle children from tin. South.

Only To See Thee, Darling. 
As sung by W M. J. Sean.cet. 
Only to see you, darling, 
Only to hear your voice, 
Even it's faintest whisper 
Would make my heart rejoice. 
Vainly I 
crave the sunshine 
Thy love would e'er impart, 
Longing once more to see thee, 
Once more before we part. 
CHORtr& 
Only to see 3 
ou, darling. 
Only to hear your voice, 
Even it's faintest whisper 
Would make my heart rejoice. 
One is the sunlit future, 
Vision of joy so bright, 
Now every gleam bath faded, 
Vanished in darkest night. 
Too late, alas I 
I 
knew thee, 
Ah could my poor heart tell, 
Breathe out it's bitter anguish 
1p that sad word, farewell.

Swig by 14onzaT 21103.A.14.• 
There's a 
litzle Irish lady 
has won from me my heart, 
She's as fair as fair can be, 
An' she's lately came from Ireland, 
Across from the ould dart, 
She's promised she'd wed me, 
Her eyes are blue as heaven's hue, 
She's got the sweetest name, 
0, I 
call her little Rosy, 
Ould Erin's pretty posy, 
She's handsome but not vain. 
CITOBITS. 
She's so fair none compare, 
With my little Rosy, 
No, there's not another ono 
Half so fair to me, 
Pretty pearl, my fresh girl, 
Love and truth combined, 
Won't it be a 
happy day 
When I 
call her mine. 
If you saw this little daisy, 
She'd surely set you crazy, 
You'd say none were so fair 
With her blush of maiden sweetness, 
She's elegance an' neatness, 
A 
jewel rich and rare, 
When all is done and we are one, 
With joy my heart will beat, 
An' a 
home I'll have so cosey, 
With little Irish Rosey, 
The sweetest of the sweet.

The Finest Police in the World.' 
As sung by Gus Wry 
LiAms The American Star Comique. 
The music to be had of E. H. H ARDING, 220 Bowery, opposite Prince 
St., price 10 cents. 
We're the finest police in the world, 
In a 
gay dress of blue, they enfold us, 
We arrest all offenders of law, 
And the people are proud to behold us; 
We walk the streets all the long dark night, 
And we take good care to be far from a 
fight; 
Our clubs are hard, and our shields are bright, 
We're the finest police in the world. 
Crimes. 
We're the finest, we're the bravest, 
We're the grandest police in the world, 
We're the finest, we're the bravest, 
We're the grandest police in the world 
We're the finest police in the world, 
And our praises are sung in the papers; 
When we find a 
disorderly man, 
Very soon he is cur'd of his capers ; 
We are the pride of the nation wide, 
And around our footsteps, no law is defied; 
The rogues all fear us ou every side. 
We 
re the finest police in the world. 
CHORUS. 
We're the finest, we're the bravest, 
We're the grandest police in the world, 
We're the finest, we're the bravest,

The Little Old House on the Rhine. 
By Atux MCCLAFFERTY. 
Ait-:—"The Old Brown Cot on the Hill." 
Sung by Gus WU.LiAMS. 
I 
remember the days that are now past and gone, 
When a 
child how I 
once loved to play, 
By the side of the mill that stands close by the stream, 
Where for pleasure I 
often would stray. 
But now I've grown old and quite feeble you see, 
And so has my poor Katharine, 
But I 
sigh when I 
think of my once happy days, 
In that little old house on the Rhine. 
CHORUS. 
It was lonely and cold and in winter ' twas drear, 
For the wind would assail it at times, 
Still there's no place on earth to my memory more dear. 
Than that little old house on the Rhine. 
Now the old school house stands just the same as before 
'With die church and its spires so grand, 
Where fond stories of love to each other we'd tell, 
As together we'd walk hand in hand. 
It was there where the old folks for pleasure would stay, 
And bask ' neath the old shady vine, 
How they'd watch us at play when from school we'd return, 
To that little old house on the Rhine, 
It was lonely, & c. 
They are both dead and gone and they sleep side by side, 
In the grave by the end of the vale. 
Where the birds sweetly sing on a 
bright summer's eve, 
And play in the moonlight so pale. 
Good-bye dear old home, fare you well for awhile. 
You've sheltered me many a 
time, 
Oh I 
I'd love to return to my old fatherland, 
And that little old house on the Rhine. 
It was lonely, &c. 
Sung With DELEHANTY & II ENGLER'S COMPANY. 
Oh my Jamie, Oh my Jamie, 
Bide the time a 
wee; 
Surely lanes must have their turning, 
Ere the travelers dee. 
Bide the time wi patience, Jamie, 
Looking to the sky, 
WaiLug like my love waits, Jamie, 
Till the clouds go by. 
Waiting like my love waits, Jamie, 
Till the clouds go by. 
CHORUS. 
Night always precedes morning, 
Hope springs from a 
sigh; 
Wait my darling, wait, my Jamie 
Till the clouds go by. 
Wait my darling, wait, my Jamie 
Till the clouds go by. 
Oh my Jamie, Oh my Jamie, 
Time goes quickly by; 
Grief must have its end, my Jamie, 
Sure as moments fly. 
In thy arms thous't held me, Jamie, 
Oft when dread was nigh, 
Lean thou on my love now, Jamie, 
Till the clouds go by. 
Lem thou on my love now, Jamie, 
Till the clouds go by.
