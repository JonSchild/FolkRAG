THE EXQUISITE SWELL. 
Words and music by Ep, C. Sirrn. 
Swig with great success by KA:TIE BOONE% with PAT ItoointItls 
N.Y. Star Conipany. 
ALLOW me, please, to speak about 
A fellow you well know; 
You'll see him almost every day, 
No matter where you go.. 
He really is a 
curious thing„ 
But lacks good common sense; 
He's called a " dude," now ain't that ruder 
! 
bat he's immense. 
CHORUS. 
He's a 
swell— can't you tell ? 
Ile imagine.s he is superfine; 
Bangs his hair, I 
declare— 
The ladies all say lies 
Dainty feet. — ain't he sweet? 
.Newmarket and diamonds as welt 
Mamma's pet—you can bet 
lie's an exquisite hth-tle-dah swelL 
His make up, it is wonderful, 
Kid gloves and necktie red ; 
Tight-litting coat, a Derby hat 
To cover a brainless head. 
He thinks he is too sweet to live— 
His wealth it is untold ; 
He's got a dog he calls a 
pug," 
And a 
pocket full of gold. 
He's a 
swell, etc.

THE NEW YORK LASSES. 
W ritten and sung by H ENuy CA.R.NEY with great success. 
On, I'll sing in the praise of the New York young lasses— 
Such charming young creatures are they— 
For some how or other, 'twixt one and another, 
My heart has been stolen away. 
It's no use one sighing, tho' hard I 
am trying, 
I 
can't tell wherever it's gone; 
For the great and the small ones, the short and the tall 
ones, 
I'm in love with them all, every one. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, the New York lasses for me, 
With their hearts and their eyes full of glee; 
I'm in love with them all,both the short and the tall. 
So the New York young /asses for me. 
Their sweet, smiling faces, as fresh as the daisies, 
Would captivate any man's heart, 
Tho' in beauty they're blooming, and quite unassuming, 
And act as they should woman's part ; 
Their eyes glisten brightly, their ways are so sprightly, 
Their modesty none can surpass; 
Tho' it may perhaps look tiring, I 
can't help admiring 
Those pretty young girls as they pass. 
Oh, the New York, etc. 
They trip like the fairy, so graceful and airy, 
They look so enchanting and pure; 
At their darning and stitching they look so bewitching— 
More like angels than mortals, I'm sure— 
They have such pretty features, these lovely young 
creatures, 
That hearts made of stone they would break. 
If one would me marry no longer I'd tarry, 
And a 
good husband, too I 
would make. 
Oh, the New York, eta

HOGAN'S HOP. 
IRISH COMIC SONG. 
Sung by O'NEIL and CONROY. 
Copyright, 1879, and published by E. II. Mumma. 
The Music. of this song will be sent to any address, post paid, on receipt 
of price, 10 cents. 
THE learned Professor Hogan 
Wore his brains down in his feet, 
The light fantastic heel he taught, 
Exceeding fine and neat; 
Of pupils he had plenty, 
His style was so tip-top, 
And every week he gave his boys 
A 
free and easy hop. 
CHORUS. 
" 
Partners for the Dublin Glide !" 
Hogan loud would call, 
Then his fiddle and his foot, 
Would echo thro' the hall. 
In the glide they glode with ease, 
Till each one had lost their breeze, 
Oh, how they'd dip, and trip, and slip I 
At Barney Hogan's Hop. 
In Hogan's mob it's fun alive, 
And not great style they prize, 
No satin trains to pulverize, 
Nor " jools " to blind the eyes. 
The etikat is aisy, too, 
At any girl you pop, 
Her belt you grip, and then you trip 
Around in Hogan's Hop. 
Partners for the, etc. 
Bidale McCann and Kassiday 
So grandly took the floor, 
And jigs and round quadrilles were danced, 
As never danced before. 
They tackled then a 
German waltz, 
Alas ! they danced no more. 
Its hay then dialect had sprained 
Their glide forevermore.

MOTHER KEEPS THE GATE LOCKED 
N OW . 
Written and sung by Gus W ILLTIms. 
Music by J. P. SKELLY. 
Music published by W. A. EVANS & Baorumt, 50 Bromfield street, 
Boston, Mass. 
I KNOW a 
lovely girl, her name is Katie Lee, 
She's charming as can be, she's all the world to me; 
But now we are apart, to see her I'm denied, 
While all the day I 
sigh to clasp her to my side ; 
Each night we used ,o 
meet, down by the garden gate, 
And happy then the hours would fly away; 
But now when 'round the house I 
fondly watch and wait, 
I 
sadly hear my little Katie say, 
Mother keeps the gate locked now, 
To see you love I 
don't know how, 
I 
must stay in the house, as quiet as a 
mouse, 
For mother keeps the gate locked now. 
We ukd to meet each night, it was a 
happy spell. 
The moon was shining bright, while tales of love I'd tell, 
But Katie oft would sigh, " Oh what will mother say, 
She thinks I'm at the gate, and I'm so far away ;" 
One night when we returned from a 
delightful stroll, 
Her mother's rage I 
could not pacify : 
I 
quickly went away, but Katie wrote to say, 
That she would come and meet me on the sly, 
For—Mother keeps the gate, etc. 
Now Katie stays at home, and I'm in distress, 
I 
wander all alone, without my happiness, 
I 
try the gate to climb, but there's a 
dog within 
That growls at me and barks, and makes an awful din; 
Poor Katie mopes all day, oh, cruel parents they, 
To treat my little girl so shamefully. 
We'll run away some night, and get married ere day-light, 
then lao more will Katie say to me, 
Vogler keeps the gate, etc. 
WOULD YOU KNOW ? 
Dedicated to Miss MINA BcanELL, and sung with success by FIELDS 
and BULDELL. 
Music published by GEO. MomNEux, 819 Broadway, New York. 
Wour.o you know my fondest treasure, 
Bright and winning, sweet and fair? 
My ideal is pure and lovely, 
And she has no thought of care. 
IIer sweet face is like the Maytime, 
And her voice is like a 
bird's; 
Eyes so bright they shine like diamonds— 
There's sweet music in her words. 
CHORUS. 
On life's way may no clouds darken ; 
May her sweetness never fade ; 
May she know no care or sorrow— 
Free from all, this little maid. 
When the summer day is dawning., 
And the world looks clear and bright, 
When the birds are sweetly singing, 
And it fills one, with delight, 
Lightly down the meadow tripping, 
Through the fields of golden grain, 
Laughing, dancing, all day singing, 
Until twilight shades the plain. 
On life's way, etc.

GOOD EVENING. 
Sung with great success by REYNOLDS and W ALLING. 
Words by H ARRY BURNS. 
Music by H. R. BASt,Z71. 
All Rights Reserved. 
NOT long ago while walking out 
Along the Avenue, 
I 
tumbled on a 
big surprise, 
It struck me as quite new. 
The boys and girls were in their glee. 
It was about midday, 
I 
thought it shockingly absurd, 
Whene'er I 
heard them say : 
CHORUS. 
Good evening, this evening. 
Are you going to the ball ? 
Not this evening, good evening, 
Good evening, one and all. 
Fine evening, this evening, 
This evening's very -warm, 
Good evening, this evening, 
Good evening, take my arm. 
While wondering and pondering 
Just what it all could mean, 
I 
chanced to look around and spy 
The sweetest little queen. 
She looked so real bewitching sweet 
I 
sighed and said, oh dear, 
She sailed up, seized me by the nose 
And whispered in my ear : 
Good evening, etc. 
We strolled along, both side by side, 
She said I 
was her mash, 
Then dragged me in a 
restaurant 
And ordered up some hash. 
She must have fasted forty days, 
I'm sure she ate her fill, 
She sweetly smiled, I 
was beguiled 
And settled up the bill. 
G-ood evening, etc. 
AMERICA'S NOBLE FIREMEN. 
Words and music by ED. C. 
SMITH. 
Dedicated to, and sung by, the VERNON SISTERS, with great success. 
THE praises we ring of different ones, 
Of our soldiers and sailors in blue, - 
Our statesmen great, our brave police, 
And all who are noble and true; 
But the subject I 
will introduce 
Is the bravest of all men, 
Who shield our lives and property ; 
'Tis our brave and noble firemen. 
Oh, hark! what cry is that 
That sounds upon the still night air? 
'Tis the midnight cry of fire. 
CHORUS. 
Listen now, the bells are riwi,mr, 
District number twenty-one; 
here come steamer number seven, 
Twenty seconds, right on time ; 
Round the corner comes the hose cart, 
Hook and ladder number ten. 
Always ready, don't forget it, 
America's noble firemen. 
When they are out upon parade, 
With their uniforms so bright, 
We all admire their gallant step, 
It fills us with delight. 
They're ever ready, niolit and day, 
The Fire King to subdue. 
Three hearty cheers for the gallant boys, 
Who are so noble, brave and true. 
Oh, hark ! what cry is that, etc.

IS THIS MR. REILLY, THAT KEEPS 
THE HOTEL? 
I'm Terence O'Reilly, I'm a 
man of renown, 
I'm a 
thoroughbred to the backbone, 
I'm related to O'Connor, my mother was Queen 
Of China, ten miles from Athlone, 
But if they'd let me be, I'd have Ireland free, 
On the railroads you'd not pay no fare, 
I'd have the United States under my thumb, 
And I'd sleep in the President's chair. 
CHORUS. 
Is that Mr. Reilly, can anyone tell? 
is that Mr. Reilly that keeps the hotel? 
Well, if that's Mr. Reilly they speak of so highly, 
Well, upon me soul, Reilly, you're doing right well. 
I'd have nothing but Irishmen on the police, 
Patrick's Day'll be the fourth of July, 
I'd get one thousand infernal machines 
To teach the Chinese how to die. 
I'll defend workingmen's cause, manufacture the laws, 
New York will be shwimming, in wine, 
One hundred dollars a 
day will be very small pay, 
When the White House and Capitol is mine. 
Is that Mr. Reilly, etc. 
DIY NEELLNDA1.. 
DE 
fast time dat I 
met her, 
I 
never shall forget, 
She took my alabaster brow 
And pressed it to her lips. 
.And then she whispered loudly, 
You're such a 
handsome chap,

CIT 0111.76. 
Charlie, he's a 
masher, Charlie, he's a 
pet, 
Charlie is the favorite of the girls ; 
He drinks his wine and soda and smokes his cigarette; 
Charlie sets my brain in such a 
whirl. 
He wears a 
new style ulsterette when out on promenade, 
With patent leather shoes upon his feet ; 
He thinks he's " deuced clever," has his own peculiar 
walk 
When he goes out the pretty girls to meet. 
He goes to all the theatres, sits in the balcony, 
Is very much in love with the dra-ma 
He would like to be an actor, but he's rather delicate, 
So he has to say, " So near, and yet so far.'

I Am a 
gay and dashing belle, 
As you are all aware, 
I 
love to dress and cut a 
swell, 
With me none can compare ; 
I'm always cheerful, light and gay, 
My heart is never sad, 
I 
strive to cast dull care away, 
To keep my spirits glad. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, yes, I 
am a 
gay young belle, 
And well I 
love to cut a 
swell ; 
Among the boys, and girls as well, 
I 
am called the Female Swell. 
The other day I 
caught a 
beau, 
lie offered me his arm, 
He talked so sweet, we walked so slow, 
lie worshipped every charm; 
Ile spoke his heartfelt love for me 
In words I 
cannot tell. 
"Pray stop," said I, " for don't you see 
That I'm the Female Swell." • 
Oh, yes, I 
am a 
gay, etti. 
As I 
walk down the crowded street 
I 
toss my flowing curls, 
And smile on every gent I 
meet; 
I'm envied by the girls, 
The little dears they are so shy, 
Their thoughts they dare not tell, 
They are afraid to wink so sly, 
Like me, the Female Swell.

ONLY a 
love letter written long ago, 
It reminds me of the happy days gone by; 
Like a 
ray of sunshine came this little sheet, 
how it made my poor heart throb with joy. 
But the writer's far away, I 
am left alone, 
Though she promised me she'd ne'er forget; 
Gone, but not forgotten, the tears they till my eyes, 
Though in heaven I 
know I'll meet her yet. 
CHORUS. 
Only a 
love letter written long ago, 
A dear little messenger of love ; 
It's all that's left me now, and it I 
dearly prize, 
And this missive, it shall go where'er I 
rove. 
Only a 
love letter written long ago, 
This letter I 
have read.it o'er and o'er; 
Once it made me happy, now I 
read and sigh, 
For those happy days will come no more. 
Treasured in my memory are the vows we made, 
But they're broken and my heart does moan; 
Love's bright dream is blasted, all is over now, 
In the dreary world I'm left alone. 
Only a 
love lett&, ctc.

DARKEST BEFORE DAY. 
MOTTO SONG. 
Words and Music by ED. C. 
SMITS, 
TUTS World is a 
stage of excitement, 
..No matter where'er you may go, 
And in this life's great drama 
Some people have hard parts, you know; 
Some people are always complaining, 
While others look cheerful and gay, 
But heed the old adage, and never forget, 
" 
It's the darkest hour just before day." 
CHORUS. 
So do not get discouraged, 
Never mind what people say, 
Make the golden rule your motto, 
And live an honest way ; 
Be upright., brave, and true, 
Alone on life's highway, 
And remember the old adage, 
" 
It's the darkest before day." 
Now all of you sometimes have bad luck, 
And the world, it looks dark and forlorn, 
It is then that your friends will all leave you, 
That is, i 
your money is gone ; 
But try and bear up and be cheerful, 
Don't mind what such friends do or say, 
It will learn you a 
lesson, and never forget 
" 
It's the darkest hour just before day." 
So do ,. ot get discouraged, etc.

LAUGIL 
As sung by NED BARRY, with great success. 
You see that I'm a 
married man, at least I 
think you 
ought, 
By eighteen months of wedded bliss some trouble I've 
been taught, 
I'm father of a 
bouncing boy who's always wide awake; 
And I've to cough to keep it quiet until my jaws they 
ache. 
SPOKEN. —
Yes, I'm the happy parent of a 
crying doll. 
I've bought rattles, India rubber tooth-rings, sugar-sticks, 
and everything else I 
could think of, but it is impossible 
to keep the child quiet, except in one manner; and that 
is why my wife is always crying out— 
CHORUS. 
Cough, John, cough, John, cough, and make the baby 
laugh, 
Cough, John, cough, John, and make the baby laugh, 
Why don't you keep. 
it still ? it's crying makes me ill, 
Cough, cough, cough John, and make the baby laugh. 
Some call the baby pretty pet, and ask us out to tea, 
Where I've to act the part of nurse, and dance it on my 
knee;

My wife she sits down with the rest to have a 
great blow 
out, 
But as the blessed infant squalls, to me she's sure to 
shout— 
Cough, John, etc. 
I 
never get a 
wink of sleep, for when in bed at night, 
The baby's sure to waken up, and cry out with affright; 
My wife commands me with one word, and then begins 
to snore 
While I've to hug that wretched child about the cham-
ber floor. 
SPOKEN.--Fancy me roused from my virtuous couch at 
midnight by a 
dig in the ribs, and told to• carry that 
wretched baby about in my night-shirt, sin-ging, " Hush 
a-by-baby," etc. 
It's Don't you hear, John; wake up, 
John; get up, John, and

My trouble never has an end, it's morning, night and 
noon; 
If I

I

If you, my friends, will cough with me, you'll quiet it 
I'm sure.

box of cough lozenges.

ROMANCE AMD REALITY. 
By GEORGE H OET. 
ROMANCE. 
" 
W HAT is the use of arguing, Ned ? 
When a 
fellow reaches my age, 
He aenerally knows what he's talking about ; 
So I 
tell you I'm booted for the 
stage.' 
I've seen a 
great deal of it at home and abroad, 
It has long been the wish of my heart ; 
One has hardly a 
care, and there's nothing to do— 
Except, p'eaps, to study a 
part. 
Then, there are the fellows— such jolly dogs! 
No better boys under the sun !— 
All full of frolic from morning till night, 
And always the first in all fun. 
Then think of the ladies, the dear little pets I 
In their presence to act what a 
treat ! 
When you rescue the maid from the toils of the wretch, 
You hear them exclaim, -` Oh, how sweet l' 
And think of the glory when the curtain descends, 
And the loud, swelling plaudits are heard ; 
I 
can almost imagine I'm an actor at once, 
Playing—well—' King Richard the Third.' 
Have I 
ever essayed? 
Well, rather, I 
guess ; 
You mustn't quite think me a 
dunce : 
I 
played ' Walsingham Potts ' in 
Trying It On,' 
At ' Private Theatricals' once." 
REALITY. 
" 
Please talk common-sense, Frank, and not like a 
fool 
Remember you live among men ; 
Come down from your trip to the skies, my dear boy, 
And seek terra firma again. 
The theatre, your haven, where, as you may think, 
Enjoy themselves every one must ; 
Though flooded with light and beauty in front, 
Behind is but tinsel and dust. 
Do you think we poor actors are free from all care, 
And are always ( as on the stage) gay ? 
No mat-ter how ill, or heavy at heart, 
We must laugh, or we forfeit our pay. 
Of glory you spoke, and loud swelling applause, 
But there's one little thing that you missed ; 
Suppose your success of a 
different kind, 
And instead of 
bravos,' you are hissed l 
Now, Frank, learn this lesson, and try to be wise, 
So in future you ne'er may be told 
' 
Two sides to a 
story,' or, as we have heard, 
All that glitters, dear boy, is not gold."

Happy hearts and smiling faces

Dancing in the dreamy waltz, 
Nothing with it can compare. 
Cares and sorrows are forgotten 
While the hours are fleeting by; 
Arm in arm: ,while we are dancing, 
Cupid steals in on the sly. 
Bright eyes they are glancing 
To the music, so entrancing, 
Filling my heart with joy. 
Come, lolz, one more dance, etc.

THERE'S sixteen dacent families 
In the house where I 
reside ; 
On summer nights to cheer ourselves 
All pleasures we have tried, 
But on the roof it's best of all, 
To hear us would be proof, 
We make the neighborhood. resound, 
All singing on the roof. 
CHORUS. 
Singing on the roof, the boys and girls together ; 
We play the concertina, likewise the sweet banjo, 
The Murphys and O'Neils come up to see the weather, 
We're highly elevated until we go below. 
Now up comes Mistress Hoolahan, 
With the baby in her arms, 
With pleasant conversation then, 
Sure every one she charms. 
There's Rosy Dunn and Reiley's son, 
And a 
Russian named O'Goofe, 
With voices loud, they join the crowd, 
All singing on the roof. 
Singing, etc. 
Young Roger Flynn got up to dance, 
-With a 
lady from next door, 
" 
Come welt the tin," says Roger Flynn. 
" 
It's like a 
ball-room floor." 
Then one by one they joined the fun, 
Sure, none could hold aloof, 
It was a 
sight that summer night, 
To see them on the roof. 
Singing, etc. 
Now that's the place to spend the night, 
And feel that pleasant breeze, 
Take up your pipe and stretch yourself 
In an attitude of ease. 
The boys and girls will gather round, 
And fill the air with glee, 
When singing on the roof at night, 
As happy a.s can be. 
Singing, etc.

TUE shades of night are falling, 
All nature is at rest; 
The whippoorwill is calling, 
The birds are in their nest; 
'Tis time that I 
was going— 
The clock has just struck eight--
To meet my little treasure, 
Down by the turnpike, gate. 
CHORUS. 
Madeline, my pretty queen, 
You are all this world to me; 
Soon beneath the shady oak, 
111 whisper, I 
love thee. 
The village clock is striking, 
Soft breezes go and come, 
But you, my love, are sweeter 
Than tho- flowers that bud and bloom, 
Two ruby lips, two blue eyes, 
Two dimpled hands so fair, 
Down in the meadow waiting ; 
It's time that I 
was there.

THE SAME THING OVER AGAIN. 
W ritten and sung by BEN DODGE. 
The music of this song is published by GEO. M OLDTEUX, 44 Fourth 
St., Brooklyn, N. Y. 
THIS world we inhabit each day rolls around • 
The same thing over again ; 
The sun it comes up and then it goes down, 
The same thing over again. 
And my friends, if you'll search this wide world through 
and through, 
'Twill prove that my statement is honest and true, 
When I 
claim in the world you will find nothing new, 
But the same thing thing over again. 
CHORUS. 
The same thing over again, 
The same thing over again, 
The whole world round there will surely be found 
The same thing over again. 
Our parents before us I've often heard said 
The same thing over again; 
In time's flight and changes have met, loved and wed, 
The same thing over again. 
They were happy and fortune smiled on them to boot, 
And of their love's union, why we are the fruit, 
They set an example and we followed suit, 
With the same thing over again. 
(

The same thing, .to.

THE SAME THING OVER AGAIN.—Concluded. 
On the sofa you sit near some charming young miss, 
The same thing over again; 
From her ripe tempting lips you will steal.2. sly kiss, 
The same thing over again. 
You are feeling quite modest and sorely perplexed, 
You're afraid to beg more for fear she will be vexed. 
But she says when you ask her " what shall we do next ?" 
The same thing over again. 
The same thing, etc. 
You are taking a 
drink with some throughbred brick, 
The same thing over again; 
Your language in time gets exceedingly thick 
From the same thing over again. 
You start for your home very light in the head, 
If you're married you creep up the stairs in a 
dread, 
And you hear as you tumble head first into bed 
The same thing over again. 
The same thing, eta. 
Of course you're aware I've a 
sweet little wife, 
The same thing over again; 
To me I 
assure you, she's dearer than life, 
The same thing over again. 
Last week she presented me with a 
young son, 
Of happier daddies than I 
there's not one, 
And I 
laughed when she said to me (merely in fun), 
The same thing over again.

shave my father every day, 
He makes me lather him, 
Because he says that is the way, 
To keep my hand in trim; 
The lumps and bumps upon his face,

take great care about, 
But always cut a

Or leave a

Sometimes a

Comes in to get a 
shave, 
And then says dad, " Look sharp, my lad 
And mind how you behave;"

And tresses trimmed with care, 
He says " Get out, you clumsy lout, 
I'll dress this lady's hair!"

ALL AMONGST THE HAY, GIRLS. 
As Sung by M 
;SS K ITTY BRooxs. 
I'm a 
young girl as you see, 
And no cares have I; 
None enjoy a 
lark like me, 
Between earth and sky; 
When the heat of day is o'er, 
I 
then haste away, 
And a 
pleasant evening pass 
All amongst the hay. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, there's no doubt about it, I 
leave home with 
the quickness of a 
velocipede and very soon find myself— 
CIIOROUS. 
All amongst the hay, girls, all amongst the hay ; 
Chatting with a 
handsome man to pass the time away; 
AU among the hay, girls, all among the hay. 
Don't you think it's very nice when all amongst the hay ? 
Youth's the time a 
beau to get, 
While cloth beauty last, 
But if you contented rest, 
Until your beauty's passed, 
Can you grumble at your state, 
If you're on the shelf; 
Who have you got to blame I 
ask'? 
No one but yourself. 
SPOKEN.—I 
don't. intend to be an old maid and sit with the cal 
on my shoulder. 
Not I. 
I 
hope to wed a 
young man with 
cheeks like roses, lips like rubies, eyes like diamonds, and above 
all, plenty of money in his pocket. 
That's the sort of a 
person 
I'm looking for. 
All amongst the bay, etc. 
PAPA'S BABY GIRL. 
Words and music by ED, C. Sisirm. 
Music published by Wm. J. A. 
LIEDER, 60 Chatham street, N. Y. 
PEEPING through the window, just at eventide, 
Full of childish innocence and glee, 
Watching for my coming down the shady lane, 
Sits my baby, watching there for me. 
A 
little pair of bright eyes has my baby gir., 
A 
mouth just as pretty as can be, 
As she lisps to mamma, standing, by her side, 
"Mamma, there comes papa don't you see?" 
CHORUS. 
Every eve at twilight, while returning home 
Thro the blinding snow or drenching rain, 
Standing at the window is my baby girl, 
Watching for my coming down the lane. 
When the shades of night fall on our cottage home, 
Then my little cherub, tired of play, 
Whispers with a 
kiss, " My papa dear, dood night." 
Then her mamma lays her toys away, 
Then upon her bended knees says her little prayer— 
" 
Now I 
lay me down to sleep and rest, 
And Dod be dood to papa and mamma too as well." 
Then she creeps into her baby nest. 
Every eve at twilight, etc.

PLEA 3E give me your attention, while I 
sing a 
little song 
About the glorious flags in our great world; 
The ones I 
have selected and present before your gaze 
You'll recognize as soon as they're unfurled. 
The first one I 
present to you is known to ev'ry one— 
'Tis the German flag, that's floated many a 
day; 
Its sight is always welcome to the suffering and oppressed; 
I'm sure you'll all agree to what I 
say. 
GERMANY. 
Then here is the flag of Germany— 
A 
flag that's not tarnished by a 
stain; 
It is dear to ev'ry one from that country o'er the sea, 
And the world has rung and echoed with its fame. 
There is a 
little island far across the deep blue sea 
Loved by ev'ry Irish heart throughout the land; 
Many years she's been oppressed by a 
country there 
close by, 
But still they can't defeat that little band. 
Its oppressors are a 
brutal set, who try to grind it down; 
They don't seem to recognize the God on high; 
But mark my words: ere long, that little isle so green 
Will conquer, for they never will say die. 
IRELAND. 
Then here is the flag of Ireland, 
The little isle where shamrock grows so green, 
And ev'ry true, brave Irish heart, no matter where it be, 
Will beat with joy whene'er its folds are seen.

THE FLAGS OF OUR NATIONS.—Concluded. 
THERE is still another flag, that I 
now will sing about, 
That is known to ev'ry country in this world— 
'Tis the glorious Stars and Stripes, that is dear to ev'ry 
man, 
And we're ever proud to see that flag unfurled, 
Its defenders are a 
brave lot, who never fear defeat, 
No matter where they are—on land or sea; 
Justice is our motto, do right to one and all— 
Three cheers for that flag so brave and free. 
AMERICA. 
Then here is our national emblem, 
A 
flag that is loved by ev'ry one, 
And one and all beneath it will cherish and respect 
The name of brave and good George Washington.

LAST Wednesday I 
attended a 
raffle for a 
stove, 
In aid of the wife and famly of Timothy J. Cosgrove ; 
Kellys, Hog-ans, and O'Briens, all came in a 
drove, 
To take the dice and shake them nice, and try and win 
the stove.

CHORUS. 
Forward Four, Allaman Left, while the music it did play ; 
'Twas grand delight to see the sight of those Irishmen so 
gay. 
I 
never laugh'd so hearty in the course of all my life, 
Looking at Plug McCarthy, pivotin' with his wife. 
At nine o'clock precisely the raffling it begun, 
Tom Kelly he jump'd ten feet high when sixty four was 
flung; 
O'Brien yell'd out murder, with a 
brick his eye was closed ; 
On that night I 
had to fight, while raffling for the stove, 
Forward Four, etc. 
At six o'clock in the morning the raffling it was o'er, 
Tom Kelly he got staving drunk and stole away the door; 
Clancy with a 
bottle, sure he all the windows broke; 
When Cosgrove grabb'd him by the neck, and boys, I 
thought he'd choke. 
Forward Four, eto.

HELP A MAN UP. 
Written and composed by ED. C. 
SMITH, and sung with tremen-
dGus success by Miss MAY VERNON in the principal Novelty 
Theatres of America. 
I'VE seen a 
great deal of this world in my time— 
This world of hardship and woe— 
Of people, all classes, both poor and the rich, 
But there's one thing I 
would like to know: 
How it is that a 
man, when he's down in the world, 
Is looked upon then with a 
frown, 
Why people will talk, but won't give their aid. 
To help this man up when he's down ? 
CHORUS. 
Now, don't despise a 
man because he wears a 
ragged coat; 
There's an honest heart beneath it, I 
am bound; 
Thrice blessed be the man that will lend a 
helping hand, 
And help a 
poor man up when he's down. 
Now, there's the poor working mechanic, 
Toiling bravely from morn until night, 
Struggling hard to earn food for his loved ones, 
Who perhaps may be starving outright; 
His clothes they are plain—sometimes ragged, 
But don't pass him by with a 
frown: 
Just speak a 
kind word, 'twon't cost you a 
cent,. 
'Twill cheer a 
man up when he's down. 
Now, don't, etc. 
This world at the best is a 
hard one, 
"Pis full of temptation and strife; 
We all have our cares and our sorrows 
As we journey along through this life. 
Should you meet a 
poor man in misfortune, 
Don't sneer, but a 
helping hand lend; 
We've but one life to live, and mark my words, 
You'll get your reward in the end. 
Now, don't, etc.

WATCHING THE STARS AS THEY FALL. 
Sung with flattering success by Miss MA:Y VERNON, the beautiful 
and talented Serio-Comic Vocalist. 
You may meet your own darling at concert or ball, 
At home with mamma sitting by, 
That is, if papa permits him to call ; 
If not you meet him on the sly. 
Where'er you may meet your bliss is complete. 
But still I 
maintain above all, 
I've tried all the rest, I 
like spooning the best, 
While watching the stars as they fall. 
CHORUS. 
Watching the stars as they fall, 
Beautiful stars as they fall ; 
With my darling I'll walk, of love I 
will talk, 
As I 
watch the bright stars as they fall. 
The stars have a 
power I 
cannot explain, 
A 
power that true lovers .know, 
One talks freely of love while gazing above, 
While the stars in response brightly glow, 
And the girl who by day will turn coldly away 
From the swain who by sunlight looks small, 
Grows tender and kind, and never says nay, 
While watching the stars as they fall. 
Watching the stars, etc.

For the old folks will not be home till late',

And would like to make you my little wife, 
So say you'll be my own, my darling Gertie, 
And I'll love and cherish you through life.

HIS GIRL. 
An Epitaph sorrowfully recited by MR. HENRY LEOPOLD. 
SHE was beautiful and fair, 
All that man could have had; 
And when I 
think of her, it 
Makes my poor heart sad, 
But now she's dead, and in 
The cold, cold ground, 
I 
think I 
hear her crying : 
What!

ROLLING ON THE GRASS. 
To those who live in cities, 
Where but bricks and mortar's seen, 
There's nothing so refreshing 
As " a 
little bit of green ! " 
So often on a 
summer's day, 
An idle hour to pass, 
Off to the fields I'd get away, 
And roll about the grass. 
CHORUS. 
Rolling on the grass, 
'Mongst the buttercups and daisies, 
That's the way, that's the way, 
An idle hour to pass ; 
Rolling on the grass, 
'Mongst the buttercups and daisies, 
Fancying you're a 
child. again, 
Rolling on the grass. 
The prettiest of carpet ' tis, 
That ever could be found, 
With daisies sprinkled here and there, 
And May bushes around ; 
A 
bright blue roof above, o'er which 
The silver clouds sail by, 
And skylarks think it but a 
lark, 
To sing up in the sky. 
CHORUS. 
While you're rolling on the grass, 
'Mongst the buttercups and daisies„ 
That's the way, that's the way, 
An idle hour to pass, 
Rolling on the grass, 
'Mongst the buttercups and daisies. 
Fancying you're a 
child again, 
Rolling on the grass.

ROLLING ON THE GRASS.—Concluded. 
One day, whilst I 
reclining was, 
And half inclined to dream, 
I 
suddenly was startled by 
A 
female's piercing scream; 
Towards me rushed a 
pretty girl, 
In fearful state of mind, 
And followed by a 
frantic cow, 
Unpleasantly behind. 
SPOKEN. — Of course to spring to my feet and catch the 
fainting maiden in my arms was but the work of a 
quarter of a 
second ; the cow on seeing my defiant atti-
tude came to a 
full stop, and stared; I 
said, waving my 
hat commandingly, " Go away, cow—go away directly !" 
and so she did, and sent us both  
CHORUS. 
Rolling on the grass, 
'Mongst the buttercups and daisies, 
That's the way, that's the way, 
That awful cow did pass ; 
Rolling on the grass, 
'Mongst the buttercups and daisies, 
Fancying you're a 
child. again, 
'Rolling on the grass. 
I 
often met her after that, 
And this was my excuse, 
That should " a 
frantic cow " turn up, 
I 
perhaps might be of use; 
She's going to change her name for mine, 
-When a 
few short weeks shall pass, 
And so I 
bless that blessed cow, 
And rolling on the grass. 
CHORUS. 
Rolling on the grass, 
'Mongst the buttercups and daisies. 
That's the way, that's the way,

That ever walked on legs ; 
Such cackling you have never heard, 
And the dickens all to pay, 
When the roosters all begin to crow 
At early dawn of day.

Such flapping, crowing, cackling, quackling, 
Feathers flying far and near, 
Mister Rooster flaps his wings (Crow) 
When daylight does appear. 
The Guinea-hen talks politics— 
I 
tell you ' tis immense--
They have some funny arguments 
While sitting on the fence ; 
The bantam struts about and flirts 
With the pigeons in the cage, 
The turkey turns black in the face, 
And the gander's in a 
rage. 
Such flapping, crowing, etc. 
The ducws are tattling all the news 
About the shanghai's brother, 
The goose put on her spectacles 
And went and kissed her mother ! 
The chickens cackled loud with joy, 
One to the other said 
Miss Malay's proud as Lucifer, 
Her first egg she has laid.

" 
DORKINS WAS TIGHT." 
Written by BENJ. D . 
COLLINS. 
Sung by Gus Wittums. 
THE theatre was full, and so were the actors, 
Dan Dorkins was going to appear 
That night in a 
bare-footed slack-wire clog, 
For he was the Pompey round here. 
The bar-room was fearfully crowded with beats 
Who awaited a 
pleasant surprise ; 
For they knew they would eat 
-When the lunch was set out, - 
And they longed for the curtain to rise. 
The curtain arose, and so did the people, 
Who began to shout and hurrah ; 
Dan Perkins came out with young Oliver Twist, 
But they gave him the laugh and yah I 
yah ! 
The play it began when the curtain went up, 
But something was wrong I 
felt sure ; 
" 
He's away off his base," says John Jas. Mansfield, 
That never went back on the poor. 
A 
brick— well it was— I 
saw Dorkins start, 
And carom on the dark red for two ; 
And it made me feel thirsty to see how he worked, 
But continually dropping his cue. 
He says, " I'm the king," when a 
woman jumped up 
Cried, " you lie, for you're one of the gang, 
And you owe me for washing." That knocked Dorkins 
cold, 
And his head on his breast did hang. 
At length the footlights he approached with a 
rush, 
And " Ladies and gentlemen," said, 
" 
if I 
haven't drank enough bourbon to-night, 
The fault is my wealth,- not my head. 
Many a 
time I 
have made you all sick, 
And get up and go out for a 
beer ; 
When me and Jim Stokes walked a 
mile in a 
week, 
How I 
wish Dan O'Leary was here. 
You insult me to-night and. say I 
am sober, 
For years I've been a 
Hamlet alone ; 
N'il tell you the reason, I 
know you will treat, 
7'•-;e aulpther-in-law dead—drunk at home."

Monarchs. 
THERE'S a 
dizzy lives in this town, 
He's awfully " fond of hash ;" 
He's called the worst beat in the West, 
And he's always on the mash. 
He has hash for breakfast, bash for dinner, 
And warmed up hash for tea ; 
Oh, says he, how I 
wish I 
had a 
house made of hash, 
How happy I 
would be. 
CHORUS. 
He's very fond of hash. and he never has any cash, 
And in a 
terrible manner could carry the banner, 
But has no -desire to see Doctor Tanner ; 
He never could get enough, and he thought it 
awful tough, 
That no one in the city would on him take pity, 
And give him a 
good free lunch. 
was 
This fellow would stand for hours and hours 
In the windows of a 
bashery ; 
He was the most dog-gon-dest crank for hash 
That ever YOU did see. 
His mammy said when he was young, 
He'd never eat cake or trash, 
But was sure to wake up in the middle of the night, 
Crying, " mamma, I 
want my hash." 
He's very fond of hash, etc. 
Oh 1 
this hash destroyer is now content ; 
He's got a 
rd hot job, 
He's head hash slinger in a 
dizzy eating house, 
He is, so help me Bob, 
Where his soprano piccolo voice is heard, 
While he's raking in the cash, 
A-yelling out at the top of his voice, 
With his mouth chuck full of hash. 
He's very fond of hash, etc.

YOU MAY LOOK, BUT YOU MUSTN'T TOUCH. 
Sung with overwhelming succesi by HARRY AIONTAGUE. 
Music of this song can be 3btained at SPEAR & DEITNELOPF, 717 Broad-
way, New York. HARRY AI ONTAGUE'S sale publishers. 
When I 
was a 
boy, a 
mischievous elf, 
I 
had a 
very bad habit of helping myself ; 
My mother put every thing out of my way, 
And well I 
remember these words she would say : 
GHORUS. 
You may look, but you mustn't touch, 
Mutsn't touch, keep your hands off, 
You're inclined to be a 
little forward, 
Now don't be so rude. 
(
Repeat.) 
At eight 'years of age, although not a 
fool, 
I 
went every day, of course, to my school, 
I 
romped with the girls, and would not let them be, 
So the school teacher gave the old lecture to me : 
You may look, etc. 
When I 
grew a 
young man, I 
loved a 
sweet maid, 
And although she loved me, she was rather too staid, 
I 
dared not embrace her, or ask for a 
kiss, 
If I 
did, the reply from my love would be this : 
You may look, etc. 
When we were engaged, I 
said, No one could blame, 
So her scruples in that way I 
soon overcame. 
This dear little darling, I 
married one day ; 
When I 
now want a 
kiss, you will not hear her say: 
You may look, etc-
