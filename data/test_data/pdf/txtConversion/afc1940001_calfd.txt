TheCALIFORNIA DADDYA poem by George Graham
Mother Love [md] it has been an inspiration formankind since poetic and artistic impulse wasfirst
recognized; writers and artists, however,have not paid as much attention to father love,though there
have been fathers who have shownan exalted devotion to their offspring just asself-sacrificing as
mother love.
In San Jose at the present time is a fatherwho has reared his ten-year-old motherlessdaughter from
infancy. From the day she wastwo years old he took her to work with him andtheir companionship
has been so wonderful thathe has been inspired to set forth his experiencein a poem. [md] Editor's
Note, Mercury-Herald.)
A story here I wish to tell,And draw on memory's flowing well;Some thoughts I would express to
you;These verses I would pen are true;And so I would convey the thoughtAnd hope that you will findI
know the path of duty wellAnd leave small cares behind.And in a modest way I'll try [md] Between
the lines you may supplyThe scenes to you I would convey [md] These past events of yesterday.And
please excuse if I relateTen years I jogged without a mate;For ten long years, just plain and rough,I
kept a home and did my stuff.Just for a girl, so dear and small,Whose angel mother God did call;For
she had passed, and ever moreHad left us for the golden shore.One babe went with her up to God
[md] Left one with me; it may seem odd;I for my wife and babe did mourn,For at this time twin
babes were born.But God had spared me one, and soI made a vow [md] I did, by Joe [md] And for
that kid, through thick and thin,A babe so dear, I'll work and win.Now with the angels she must
be,With tender thoughts for Babe and me;And God had given this babe to cheer,For me to love, and
teach, and rear.And so my little girl she grew [md] And I've been dad and mother, too;And with my
wee one in my car,I've worked for people near and far.Her food and things I'd bring along,And in my
heart a thankful song;I'd work and [toil?], and Babe would play;Sometimes the boss would yell, "Hey!
Hey!""You rest the team (his name was Mack);Go get the kid and hurry back."Sometimes I'd hurry to
my car,And reach inside and get the jar.This jar contained my baby's food [md] Prepared with care
[md] I understood.Her bottle filled with wants so small;A gentle pat [md] asleep she'd fall.And at
one place I lost my jobFor having her along;Just seemed I couldn't do my workWithout that baby's
s/ong.I stopped to dress a baby hand [md] A bandage for to find [md] And other men so hard at
work [md] I must have fallen behind.For baby hands, you know so well,At times get hurt, you all can

tell.I found kind people, many so,Who helped us on our way you know.Ten years went by; I saved
some dough,And bank accounts, you know, grow slow.I planned to buy some land, and bringMy
babe where I could work and sing.So in a river deep and mean [md] An island small with trees so
green;The place looked good; the price was fair [md] I'll tell you how we landed there.This land to
reach, I know that nowI must construct a boat or scowWith lumber that I rafted here [md] The boat
and all the inside gear,And other things to make the boatWere fashioned from a care remote.My
boat, I built it near the bank [md] With faith, and hope, and cedar plank.And I would like to tell you
here,I planned and made this boat so queer.To think it out, the fun was great,And do the stunt that
seemed my fate.And thoughts came marching in the whileMy baby with me did beguile.At work, at
play, my only thoughtWas for my baby as I wrought.The silence [md] it seemed so profound [md]
The rushing river, ocean-bound;The power plant, and engine quick;The drive wheels on each side
did kick.To go ahead, reverse, and turn,And how the water they did churn!If Maple Isle you visit,
though,You'll see just how this craft can go.Say, fetch along some help with you [md] A friend, I mean
[md] a friend or two.You'll lose your head [md] you will, by heck,When on this craft you tread the
deck.So days and weeks with saw and song,This boat I built so good and strong.With babe asleep
[md] sometimes at play [md] I'd work and sing the livelong day.And often, as asleep she lay,Of course
I knew wild beasts might str/ay;For at that time a jungle wildWas very near my camp and child. And
as I worked, I watched that kid [md] At sleep, at play [md] I surely did.I'd fastened every plank and
beam;With care I caulked up every seam;And when I had the engine in,Switched on the juice, and
made it spin [md] (It never had four-wheel brakes),But wheels and things like other makes [md] This
engine with my foot would start [md] Three speeds, reverse, all did their part.To launch that boat,
the world I'll tell,And on this theme I love to dwell.You see, I'd never made a boat,And people said
it would not float,But just the same I launched the scow [md] In simple words I'll tell you how.And
so from trees that grew near byI cut some logs and poles to pry [md] To pry it up so many waysIt
took me all of two long days;With tackle block, and roe, and fall;And then at times my pal would
call,"Come, Daddy dear, come quick to me,I see a great big bumble bee!"And then I'd sit me down
so blest,And in my arms that girl would rest;And to her I told all my plans,With loving pats of baby
hands,And baby prattle in my heart,Soon to my task once more I'd start.A bower I made so neat
within,Where Babe could sleep [md] no traffic [din?].And so, dear friends, this story trueAt times I
fear may tire you.And now the boat, once more my theme,Had quit the bank, and on the streamShe
looked so staunch and rode so high,To run my craft I'd do or die.And then I piled my camp things on
[md] The stove, the bed I brought along;And household things so many more;My baby left I safe on
shore.The blessed child, she did not cryWhen I pushed off the boat to try.The throttle then I opened
wide,And out into the stream did glide;Tried gear and engine through and through,For me and
Babe would be the crew.Faith in my crew was good as gold;No pilot's license did I hold,And for/ our
cruise this craft would do.Back to the bank once more I drew.Then crib and baby I put on,Stepped
on the gas and we were gone.Then out across the water wild,With hope and prayer, my thoughts

beguiled.Our boat, so good, so staunch, and true;Our distant island full in view;She churned along;
my heart did cheer;Our future home was drawing near.But at one time my engine stopped,Then
two girl eyes wide open popped.I for a time my bean did rack;I guess she thought us going back.And
for a time I lost control,The waves so high our boat did roll;And then my darling said to me."Let's go
on home; I see a tree."The engine trouble soon I found,And had my drive wheels going round.With
engine going good and fast,The roughest water soon was passed.We came to shore so near a
grove;Near some large oaks our boat we hove,And right into a sheltered bay,I made her fast and
there she lay.Our camping things I soon got out;It was so nice, I had to shout;And yell I did, and made
it ring [md] So many [birds?], and on the wing.At first, so-so, I cleared enough,And made our camp
[md] I knew my stuff.A shady spot for Babe to play [md] The day was warm, the month was May
[md] And made a place beneath a tree [md] My baby girl was nearly three.I brought her crib and
everything,And then I fixed a tiny swing.She'd play awhile, then fall asleep.It surely made the willows
weepTo see a head so small and brown;And, tired out, she nestled down.You may well guess my pal
so dearHad peaceful sleep with daddy near;And when the shades of night came on,The night birds
would begin their song.I guess at times the bears did growl;We often hear the coyotes howl.We had
a dog [md] a faithful boy [md] That baby was his pride and joy,The voice of friends through space,
you know,Came to us on/ my radio.Of course I stretched an aerial wire;With logs I made a big camp
fire.With gratitude my way I trod,And made a home and thanked my God.My girl is now past ten
years old;So far, so good, the story told;And of this tale the last is best,And soon my pen must come
to rest.We welcome to our island queerThe many friends who greet us here.Neath oak and maple's
leafy bowerTheir camps are made at twilight hour.To cheer our home from day to day [md] To work
and plan, and live and pray.In hope this thought may come to you,I've tried to pen these verses true.
