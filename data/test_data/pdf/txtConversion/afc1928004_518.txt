I'm bothered, yes, I'm bothered, 
Completely perplexed; 
I'm the father of a 
little poy, 
I'm not happy, but I'm vexed. 
I 
have ninety-nine relations, 
And they nearly drive me wild, 
Both one and all, both great and small, 
They want to name the child. 
CHORUS. 
My wife she said it'll be Michael, 
Her sister said it'll be Matt, 
Her brother said it'll be Charlie, 
Whilst her aunt said no, it'll be Pat. 
Whilst my mother wants him Shamus' 
And my father wants him Paul, 
By heavens sure I 
don't know what 
I'll call the child at all,

I'LL NAME THE BOY DENNIS, 
ETC.— CONTINUED. 
T'was only here this morning, 
My brother came from Troy, 
lie swore by this, he swore by that, 
Tliat he would name the boy. 
Says my wife's brother Darby, 
He be hanged if that would do, 
And they jumped together on the floor, 
And had.a bold set-too. 
Next Sunday is the Christening, 
And I 
tell you by the way, 
I'll have none of their connivings, 
Pm bound to have my say. 
They may call him this, and call him that, 
I 
don't give that, for their call, 
I'm bound to call him Dennis, 
Or he'll have no name at all. 
CHORUS. 
My wife may want him Michael, 
Her sister may want him Matt, 
My brother he may want him Charlie, 
Whilst her aunt may want him Pat. 
Whilst my mother wants him Shamus, 
And my father wants him Paul, 
I'm bound to call him Dennis? 
Or 
have no name at all,

The Day I 
Took My Peg to Coney Isle.

by Dan McCarthy.

You may think that I 
am mad, but I 
only do feel sad, 
And the reason I 
will tell you every one; 
I 
courted a 
nice young girl, and her name was Peggy Doyle, 
And I 
took her to Coney Isle to have some fun. 
She is from the County Down, and she weighs 200 lbs., 
And I 
thought she would be true to me all the while; 
But if I 
had it to do again, she would never go to 
Swim along with me again to Coney Isle. 
CHORUS 
She had salt water there galore, 
And she swallowed a 
quart or more, 
And the gang upon the beach began to smile, 
Sure they all did wave their hats, 
And shouted float her Pat, 
The day I 
took my Peg to Coney Isle. 
Now its when we reahed the pier, we went and had some 
beer, 
And after that we went to have a 
bathe. 
You may talk about the fat woman that travels with Bar-
num's show, 
But you'd ought to see my Peg upon the waves. 
The gang began to guy us, my bosom was on fire, 
And some of them gave me a 
grand hurrah! 
When a 
lad with a 
crooked mouth 
a- 
Be heavens shouted out, there's one of the lions 
That escaped the other day. Chorus. 
Now of course I 
did feel mad after listening to that hid, 
And I 
know he thought himself quite smart, 
But if I 
had him in New York, up near the Central Park, 
You can bet that I 
would break his heart. 
I 
don't say Pm a 
fighter, a 
cutter or a 
biter, 
But I 
always take my own part all the while; 
Arrah mushat bad luck to Peg, 
May she lose one of her legs, 
Before I 
take her again to Coney Island,

Before you stands a 
lad 
With a 
heart that's never sad, 
And the reason why ? I'll tell you all to night, 
I'm late of Erin's Isle 
And with my pleasant way and style, 
I 
have won a 
girl who is my heart's delight. 
She lives up here in Harlem, 
With her parents she's a 
darling, , 
And I 
know she is her mother' only pride. 
I 
can sing and dance together, 
With this darling little treasure, 
And its now 
going to claim her as my bride 
CHORUS. 
She,s sweet as a 
rose 
With a 
nice little nose, 
She drcsses quite neat though not proud, 
With nice golden hair. 
There is none can compare 
With my Mary Ann Holahan Doud. 
I 
saw her yesterday 
While a 
passing by her way, 
The was sitting in her garden all alone 
And I 
saw her throw a 
kiss 
To me, did this little Miss, 
And it made my heart with joy beat I 
will owl% 
Then quickly I 
did glide, 
To the garden by her side, 
And we walked and talked together until noon, 
And she said her parents were willing 
And their consent they had given, 
sure we are going to get married very soon,

Oh I'll tell ye of a 
party, boys, 
I 
attended here last night, 
It was down to Casey,s at the old Sixth Ward, 
Now it was an el( gant sight. 
There was singing, yes, and dancing, 
And whiskey there galore, 
And the boys would smile, and the girls put on style, 
As they danced and welted the floor. 
CHORUS. 
Wid me fa-did-ne-ah did-ne-ah oh, 
Wid me thah-sha-shin-go-mis-ka Joe, 
And around on their toes they danc'd just so, 
At Casey's ball last night. 
Oh, we kept the ball a 
rolling, boys, 
Till the hour of twelve drew nigh, 
Casey took some whiskey, swallow'd glass and all, 
With the laughing I 
nearly died. 
Then we all flew for the kitchen, 
Put the turkey out of sight, 
Little Widow Dunn, by the crowd was sung, 
And they kept it up all night. 
Chorus.

Irish Sketch. 
Composed by BEN H. 
BENTON. 
DAN.—Good avening, Cornalius. 
COR.—How are you, Dan McCarthy? 
DAN.—Where was you going the other day when I 
saw 
you up town ? 
COR.—I 
was going to the walking match. 
Sir John Astley 
sent me a 
letter by telegraph asking me to keep my eye on 
things for him. 
DAN.—Did you do as he asked you ? 
COR.—I 
tried to, but nearly got in a 
muss over it with the 
doorkeeper. 
He says to me: " You're in such a 
hurry, man 
(Harriman), people will think you're interested. 
DAN.—An' is ( Ennis) that all the trouble you had ? 
COR.—Well, he made me feel kind of Leary before such a 
crowd. 
DAN.—(R) 0, well, you got off better than I 
did. 
I 
was 
arrested, and have been locked up ever since. 
COR.—Who arrested you ? 
DAN.—Captain Williams arrested me for assault and bat-
tery. 
He was going to Blake a 
man's jaw for interfering. 
COR.—Oh, oh; what did you do? 
DAN.—He arrested me for striking a 
match. 
COR.—I'm glad you're out, but I've been arrested myself, 
for mayhem. 
DA/C.—That was a 
tough charge. 
How was it ? 
COR.—I was arrested for biting my nails. 
DAN.—How did you get out of it ? 
COR.—The judge told me that unless I 
got some minister 
or preacher who knew me to vouch for my character, he'd 
send me up to give sparring exhibitions with Joe Coburn ; so 
I 
sent for Senator Bob Hart, and he got me out right away. 
By the way, where have y4144 been ? 
9 
DAN.—Shure, man (Sherman), I've been to Washington to 
see the President. 
He's ( Hayes) a 
friend of mine. 
Co.—Have yo -1 
any influence ? 
I 
have an application in 
as watchman on the Elevated Road—watching the tracks to 
see that no dogs or cattle get on them. 
DAN.—Well, I 
have some influence, and can get you a 
good job. 
Co.—Can you ? 
What as ? 
DAN.—Up in the Park, inspector of goats! 
COR.—You're giving me a 
kid ? 
DAN.—No, I 
am not. 
You're stretching it, but it's a 
soft 
job. 
I 
can get your brother a 
job, too. 
COR.—What to do ? 
DAN.— Keeping the rest of your family from going to Sing 
Sing. 
COR.—You wouldn't do for a 
job like that, as all your 
family's there except yourself, and you'll follow them as soon 
as you get your trial. 
DAN.—You're too sharp. 
I 
see I 
cannot down you, al-
though you are a 
stranger in the city. 
Have you been around 
visiting the different places ? 
COR.—I 
have some. 
Do you know a 
good way for me to 
make a 
visit to Sing Sing ? 
DAN.—I 
do. 
Go up Fifth avenue and steal diamond ear-
rings. 
COR.—I see you're full of it this evening. 
Do you know 
any jokes ? 
DAN.—I 
do, Tim Corneel, I 
do. 
Co.— Well, ask me some, Bunt. 
DAN.—Do you know the weight of a 
fool ? 
COR.—I never saw you weighed, but I 
give it up. 
What 
is the weight of a 
fool? 
DAN.—A 
simpleton (simple ton). 
Co.— I'm afraid anybody buying you will get short weight. 
Well, let me ask you one. 
What makes a 
hog grunt? 
10 
DAN.— I 
don't know. 
There's no one touching you. 
CoR.—Why is your mouth like the sounds of a 
dying man 
coming from a 
hospital? 
DAN.—I 
give it up. 
Why 
is your mouth like the sounds of 
a 
dying man coming from a 
hospital ? 
COR.—Because the noise that comes from it makes the 
t:eople pity you. 
DAN.—I 
had you that time. 
Ha, ha, ha! 
COR.—What are you laughing at ? 
DAN.—I 
am laughing at nothing. 
COR.—Well, if you look in the glass you will see a 
great 
deal less. 
Let us sing a 
song. 
FOREMEN ON THE ELEVATED ROAD. 
Here we are, two light-hearted Irishmen, 
We hold our heads as high as any in the laud, 
We shun all Irish like Pat Rooney ; we want you to un-
derstand 
We're foremen on the Elevated Road. 
Two dollars a 
day is all the pay we get, 
in our gang is Mike the Bite, alias the Weehawken Pet. 
We keep our men to work, and never let them set 
Like the foremen on the Elevated Road. 
CHORUS. 
Then give three hearty cheers for Cornalius and Dan, 
Who can warble a " Come all ye" like true- horn Irishmen ; 
We like no interference when in charge of our gang, 
Do the foremen on the Elevated Road. 
Every morn at eight o'clock we get them all together, 
'Tis then we call the roll, in wet or shiny weather ; 
It makes but little difference—they're all as tough as 
leather, 
Are the laborers on the Elevated Road. 
At half-past five at night, ' tis then that we get done, 
To our wives and children home we very quickly run ; 
They say my boy is like his father— the little son of a 
gun, 
Oh, oh, we're proud foremen on the Elcvated :.oad.

The Pennsylvania Tramp. 
Words by CHARLES BURNS, and sung by DAN MCCARTHY, with sum*. 
Throughout the Country. 
Oh, here I 
am a 
lonely stranger, 
All the way from Pennsylvania, 
When I 
work, my life is in danger, 
I'm a 
noble sinecure. 
Hi•Yah. 
I 
have traveled this world over, 
And in my pockets I 
have many a 
stamp, 
I'm a 
holy terror to this nation, 
Yes, I'm the Pennsylvania tramp, 
CHORUS. 
Measuring is my occupation, 
And hunger give's me many's the cramp, 
Work and me are no relations, 
For I'm the Pennsylvania tramp. 
From New Haven to Wee hawkin, 
That's the road, boy; don't be talking, 
On my back I've an army walking, 
Ladies come and pity me—Hi-Yah. 
Barn or wood- shed, that's my bed-room 
When the weather is cold or 
Stealing chickens—that's the racket, 
For I'm the Pennsylvania tramp. 
Oh, I'm a 
man that's never greedy, 
You will never rind me seedy, 
I'll rob a 
clothes if I 
am needy, 
I 
am an old professional. 
Hi-Yah. 
I'm on the hunt for money, 
Poverty is my highest lamp, 
And a 
maid with stamps, boys, 
That's the honey for I, 
The PennsIvania tramp. 
(Chorus).

Written and sung by DAN MCCARTHY. Music by T. F. KERRIGA;I. 
I 
was .down last night to Donovan's dance, 
Where the boys and girls did sing and prance. 
Such a 
noisy gang I 
never did see, 
And never in my life had I 
such a 
spree, 
Old Donovan himself was managing the floor, 
And old Casey, the piper, was sitting at the door, 
When Mrs. Moriarty, while a 
pedling out the beer, 
Run against old Casey and knocked him out of the chi 
Cuottus. 
There was lots of fun for all the boys, 
And lots of rum and lemon pies, 
There was pipes, tobacco, punch and 'tea, 
And we danced like the devil 
Until the break of day. 
There was One-legged Dougherty a 
sitting on a brxre 
With long Gill Riley and cross-eyed Farrell, 
And Miss 01Rooney's sister, Jane 
Wv.s dancing a 
jig with Daniel Kane. 
Then One-legged Dougherty—he got tight, 
heaped on the floor and wanted to fight, 
And we fired him out before he had a 
chance, 
Sure we had the devils's own time at Donovan's dmice. 
(Chorus.) 
Beautiful World On High. 
AN END SONG. 
Written, composed, and sung by DAN MCCARTHY, with great 
suceesa. 
Oh, sinners, stop your wickedness, 
Come join our band and pray, 
In this beautiful world on high. 
If you don't the Lord will burn you up, 
On our next judgment day, 
In this beautiful world on high. 
Now, Hell, you know, is deep, and Hell is wide, 
in this beautiful world on high. 
It aint a 
got no bottom, and it aint a 
got no sides, 
In this beautiful world on high. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, I'll be dar, yes, dar, 
Oh, I'll be dar, 
And victory's crown of glory I'll be sure to wear, 
In this beautiful world on high. 
Oh, Henry Ward Beecher is getting cracked, 
In this beautiful world on high. 
carries Plymouth Church around on his back, 
In this beautiful world on high. 
Yes, and he wears his shirt outside of his coat, 
In this beautiful world on high, 
And he buttons his pants around his throat, 
In this beautiful world on high. 
The Devil's In New Jersey. 
Words by CHARLES BURNS, and sung with great success by 
DAN M CCARTHY. Music by T. F. KEmuoIN,the Piper. 
As I 
rose up last Sunday, boys, 
I \:as feeling a 
kind of merry, 
Says 
have a 
jolly time, 
So I 
crossed over to Jersey by the ferry, 
But never again will I 
do that same, 
For the consequence was frightning. 
Now, what can you expect of a 
man, 
Filled up with Jersey lightning? 
CHORUS. 
Oh, you may talk of this, and you may talk of that, 
And you may talk of places noisy, 
But, by the—no, I 
will not swear, 
But the devil is in New Jersey. 
I 
ran in mud up to my eyes, 
For I 
never yet was lazy, 
When a 
big policeman scooped me in, 
And he swore that was crazy. 
I 
was surrounded in a 
cell, 
With big mosquittoes flying. 
And when morning came, from the kiss of blood, 
Sure I 
thought that I 
was dying. 
(Chorus.) 
Next day E 
went before the Judge, 
And he looked on a-
fo with pity, 
He says, "Young man, the sentence is, 
One hour to leave the city." 
I 
did not wait to hear the rest, 
And you can bet / was not noisy, 
For when : stepped in New York I 
cried, 
. " May the devil shoot New Jersey. 
(Chorus.) 
THE DEVIL'S 
IN NEW JERSEY, 
(Continued.) 
Now when I 
got home I 
found my wife, 
Along with a 
big club awaiting, 
She said to lay her hands on me 
That her tender heart was breaking, 
We had it up and down the floor, 
And at last I 
cried for mercy, 
When she cried, "You sucker, go anywhere, 
But, for God's sake keep from Jersey." 
(Chorus.) 
On the 13th of October, In The 
Middle of July. 
A COMIC IRISH REFRAIN. 
Sung with tremendous success, by DAN M CCARTHY. 
Oh, it was on the 13th of October, 
In thc middle of July, 
Oh, tlic forenoon wasn't wet at all, 
And the afternoon was dry—what do you soy ? 
I 
espied a 
lovely damsel, 
Down under an old oak tree. 
Ah, the devil a 
word I 
s 
tid to her, 
And she said the same to me.

From Middletown to Watertown. 
A 
comic Irish retrain, sung, with great success, by DAN MCCARTHY. 
Oh, from Middletown to Watertown 
Is fifteen miles 
And from Watertown to Middlotown 
Is fifteen miles. 
Oh, from Middletown to Watertown, 
And from Watertown to Middletown 
Yes, from Middletown to Watertown 
Is fifteen miles. 
CHORUS. 
At the battle of the Nile, 
We were fighting all the while, 
All the while we were fighting, 
At the battle of the Nile. 
Yes, at the battle of the Nile 
We were fighting all the while, 
All the while we were fighting 
At the battle of the Nile.

The Escape of the Catalpia Six. 
Words by Thomas MAGUIRE, and sung to the air of " Little Robin, Tell 
Kitty I 
am Coming,'with great success, by DAN MCCARTHY. 
Come, gather kinds, and listen, 
And a 
story to you I 
will tell, 
You, no doubt, have heard of Erin's great heroes, 
Who 
in the latest of battles have fell. 
But the greatest of things that have happened, 
And may never happen no more, 
Is the escape of the six Fenian prisoners, 
Away from Australia's shore. 
CHORUS. 
Let us hope then the day is not distant, 
When the Irish shall rise up in bands, 
And sever the bonds that unite them, 
And make of themselves a 
free land. 
When these good men were sentenced in Ireland, 
Their country for trying to save, 
They were sent to the shores of Australia, 
And there made the proud Saxons' slaves, 
And they served out ten years of their life time, 
And they vowed that they would serve no more, 
So they escaped on the good ship Catalpia, 
And sailed for America's shore. 
(Chorus.) 
When the good men escaped to the whaleship, 
- The authorities thought them to stay, 
So they sent out their warship Georgetta, 
Before they had time to away. 
" 
Now, we want you to deliver those prisoners, 
Or on you we will fire if you lag." 
And they answered, " If on us you fire, 
You will be insulting our American flag." 
Honest Irish Lad.

My name is McNamara, 
And I 
came from County Clare, 
In the darling little Isle acrcAs the sea, 
Where the mountains and the hills, 
And the brooks and rippling rills, 
Are Nature's sweetest music all the day. 
Our little farm was small; it could not support us all, 
So one of us was forced away from home. 
And I 
bade them all good bye, 
With a 
tear drop in my eye, 
And I 
sailed for Castle Garden all alone. 
CHORE'S. 
I'm an honest Irish lad, 
And of work I'm not afraid, 
If it's pleasure to you I 
will sing and dance, 
Yes, I'll do anything you say, 
If you will only name the day, 
When they'll give an honest Irish lad a 
chance. 
When I 
landed in New York, 
I 
tried hard to get work, 
Yes, I 
traveled through :the streets from day to day, 
And I 
went from place to place, 
With starvation in my face, 
HONEST IRISH LAD. 
(Continited). 
When lask for work they want no help, they say, 
Yet still I 
wandered on, 
In hopes I 
would find one, 
Who would give alad a 
chance to earn his bread, 
But I 
find it's all the same, 
And I 
know I'm not to blame, 
And I 
often times have wished that I 
was dead. 
( 
Chorus. ) 
But I 
know I 
have one kind friend, 
Who a 
helping hand will lend 
To a 
poor boy and help him on at home, 
And I'll bring my mother here, 
And my little sister, dear, 
And never from them more again I'll roam. 
I 
will try and do what's right, 
I 
will work both day and night, 
Yes, I'll try and do the very best I 
can, 
And God will bless the heart 
That will take a 
poor boy's part, 
And make an honest Irish lad a 
man,

Dan McCarthy's Advice. 
Is you listen to me I 
will sing you a 
song 
Of something that happened to me, 
I 
went to the theatre a 
short time ago, 
All the pretty girls for to see. 
Now, the first that came out on the stage, 
Was a 
young girl in her teens, 
And she wore spangled clothes. 
And went around on her toes, 
And she roped me behind the scenes. 
CHORUS. 
So now, kind friends, take my advice, 
And keep away from the girls in their teens, 
For you will find thein old enough to chew hay, 
When they get you behind the scenes. 
It's the devil's own place, as you will find, 
But that's as you may think, 
Where the girls will tickle you under the chin, 
And it will cost you a 
dollar for a 
drink, 
Yes, anti they use all kinds of circus slang, 
"Stag the terrier with the striped jeans." 
Oh, they roped me in with the rest of the gang, 
When they got me behind the scenes, 
(Chorus.)

Just Because I 
Am Irish. 
Written and composed by Jon McVmou, and sung with immense 
success by DAN M CCARTHY, the great Irish vocalist and dancer. 
Music by T. F. KERRIGAN, the celebrated Piper. 
Copyrighted, 1879, by A. J. FISHER, 24 Vesey Street, N. Y. 
Oh, I 
came to this country a 
short time ago, 
To better my fortune to find, 
For the old country, sure, is a 
very hard place, 
For any poor hard-working boy. 
But it's little better here, to my sorrow I 
find, 
As I 
search for employment each day, 
And to get it I 
can't; and the reason is this, 
Just because I 
am Irish, they say. 
CHORUS. 
Just because I 
am Irish they would give me no work, 
Just because I 
am Irish they cry, 
But where ever I 
go, in good fortune or woe, 
I 
will still be a 
true Irish boy. 
Aint it hard now,I ask you,that such things should be 
In a 
country where all are free men ? 
What have Irishmen done, now I 
plainly ask you, 
That such slurs should be cast upon them ? 
In America's troubles in days long ago, 
In the battle fields, fiercest arrayed, 
They did nobly fight for their God and the right, 
" 
Just because I 
am Irish," they cry. 
(Chorus.) 
I 
will say little more; I 
don't wish to offend, 
As my aim it is ever to please, 
And this world is a 
hard one to the poor,you all know 
With but little comfort and ease, 
There's a 
haven of rest away up in the skies 
That is ever pleasant and fair, 
And God, in His Infinite mercy, I 
know, 
Will admit all good Irishmen there, 
(Chorus.)

There's a 
girl of high degree upon whom I 
am awfully stuck, 
She dances in the ballet, while her father drives a 
truck ; 
Her mother she peddles lemonade, her brother he slings hash, 
Yet the neighbors say most every day, Johanna's on the mash. 
CHORUS. 
Johanna Louisa McGuire 
Is a 
girl that you all could admire 
She's a 
voice like a 
bell, 
Though I 
never could tell 
Where she got it or how, 
Yet you all do allow 
That Johanna Louisa McGuire 
Has something that you all would desire, 
For she's awfully gay on St. Patrick's day, 
Is Johanna Louisa McGuire. 
She inhabits a 
little sky parlor up an alley where everything's 
snug, 
Tier furniture's very antique, a 
table, three chairs and a 
jug. 
I 
One evening at the window sat as her invited guest, 
From the alley below some young devil did throw a 
cud of 
Jackson's best. 
SPOKEN.—It 
struck the girl bang in the eye, the old yellow 
Jack molasses tobacco. 
I 
was about to sympathize with her, 
when one of those young devils yelled— 
Johanna. Louisa McGuire, & c. 
As the merry birds that warble in the trees, 
Or the wild flowers that scent the summer breeze, 
As I 
wander here and there, without a 
thought of care, 
My happiness does every hour increase.

I 
am bidding you good-bye, Dan, dear, I'm going fat 
away, 
I'm leaving Ireland far behind, going to America; 
Thin you be good to mother, Dan, and little Patsey, too, 
I'll get work in America, and send for all of you. 
CHORUS. 
Good-bye, Daniel, dear, Teddie are you leaving ? 
Let your heart be of good cheer, and try and not be 
grieving. 
Bear this parting like a 
man—Teddie, I 
will try, 
Good-bye, Daniel, farewell, Teddie, 
Daniel—Ted—good-bye. 
Our home will be a 
sad one, whin you have gone away, 
And we will watch until a

And mother says her prayer shall be, God speed hei

Yes, you'll be always in our mind, each day we breal< 
our bread, 
Good-bye, Daniel, dear, etc. 
So now I 
must be leaving you, but, oh, it wont be long,

The money for my brother Dan, to come across the foam. 
Good-bye, Daniel dear, etc.

COMIC CHARACTER SONG. 
Words and music 
Sung with great success by 
MURPHY and MACK. 
It's very strange indeed to me, that go where'er I 
may, 
So many queer remarks I 
hear about me every day; 
'Twas but last night upon the street, my style the boys did qui.' 
And one says " You can have it pards, if you guess what it is !" 
SPOKEN—As soon as they saw me they shouted, " Here it 
comes !" and as I 
approach they all began to sing— 
CHORUS. 
What is it ? heavens what is it ? 
Does it live do you know ? or is it a 
chromo ? 
Did it blow out, or did it grow out 
Oh ! for heaven's sake, what is it ? 
'Twas in the Park, a 
lively mob at me did talk and stare, 
" 
I 
wonder if it's loaded, and if that's all its own hair," 
"It lives, it breathes," one chap did say, its pulse is all serene. 
Approaching me " Old Krank," says he, " I'll see that you're 
kept green! 
SPOKEN—Yes, and 
" 
Look out for it, it's teethin' !" and then again comes the 
conundrum— 
What is it, &c. 
They asked how long I 
walked alone, and say " when were 
you canned ?" 
And hint I'd look much better if upon my head I'd stand; 
And as around the Square I 
walk, with gloves and cane and 
Pipe, 
I 
heard them whisper everywhere, " I 
wonder if it's ripe !" 
SPOKEN—Yes, they want to know if I'm natural or artificial, 
and how many of me there are in a 
bunch, and whether I'm 
good raw t .13At abc'v 
ill they wildly ask— 
What is it, &c. 
when I 
say a 
word back, they shout,

Music by John E. Murphy, of Murphy & Mack, and sung 
by him with great success. 
I 
came to tell you I 
am in love, 
With a 
girl lives on a 
farm, 
She feeds the pigs, does Irish jigs, 
And possesses a 
lovely charm. 
Her teeth are like the snow so white, 
She is the prettiest girl for miles, 
Her hair it hangs, she wears no bangs, 
And her face is covered with smiles. 
CHORUS. 
For she is the maid that I 
adore, 
I 
am sure I'd call her mine, 
For I 
know that I 
would surely die, 
Without little Nellie O'Brien. 
She is as pure and innocent as a 
lamb, 
Her face I 
can't forget, 
She is her mother's only joy, 
And her father's little pet. 
I've proposed and she has accepted, 
Soon I 
will take her hand, 
The twelfth of May is our wedoing day, 
Then we'll join the matrimonial band.

Great Grandma Sarah Jane. 
Written by James Richmond and sung by Billy Barry, 
with great success. 
AIR—Fire in the Grate. 
Grandma has fendered her resignation, 
From this wicked world of sin; 
She packed her valise and departed, 
It contained a 
pack of cigarettes and some nigger gin. 
She left her false teeth to Cousin Minnie, 
She gave pa the price of a 
shave, 
They put Dennis Kearney's picture on her tombstone, 
To keep the crows from off her grave. 
CHORUS— 
Her mind was always mashing, 
She was too fresh and awful shrewd ; 
She weighed ninety pounds when in fighting condition, 
And she never smoked or chewed. 
She used to go fishing with Christopher Columbus, 
And shooting shadows till she went insane. 
For a 
curiosity she took the prize, 
My great grandma, Sarah Jane. 
She tried to sing bass and swallowed her teeth, 
Her lungs from eating snuff were sore; 
She was so bashful if there was a 
man in her room, 
She'd get up and shut the door. 
She willed her voice to her uncle's nephew, 
When she died she was one hundred and eighty-seven, 
They say she is cook in a 
five-cent restaurant, 
Four miles and a 
half from Heaven.

Written, composed and sung by Was. J. 
SCANLON, in SCANLON it CRONIN'S 
famous sketch, entitled •' Life in a 
Tenement House." 
I've got a 
daughter I 
talk to all day, 
But the devil a 
word will she mind what I 
say, 
In spite of advice she'll go far away. 
Sometimes she cannot be found. 
If I 
say stay at home, begorra she'll get mad, 
She'll call me an ould tad, say I've got them bad, 
Inside of an oyster I 
ought to be clad, 
To a 
nannie goat I 
ought to be bound. 
CHORUS. 
Ah, but if I 
catch the man 
That tauglit her to dance 
The la-de-da dance, the tra-le-la dance, 
On the top of his nose I'll make my fist prance, 
And twist off the both of his legs, ha, ha! 
(Repeat.) 
At night she'll put on her fo1-de-lol-lols, 
Then she'll skip off to her picnics and balls, 
Then on the neighbors she'll make her grand calls. 
Borrow all the clothes that she can. 
For a 
bustle she'll wear my coderie pants, 
My chin-chilly vest, or anything by chance, 
But if I 
catch the laddie-buck that taught her to danm 
I'll twist off the both of his legs.

One I

Bonnets and ribbons she does sell; 
On the Bowery she owns a

She has " Milliner " on the door, 
And Augustine Delia Clancey that's the belle. 
Shure it's every Sunday night, 
It is my heart's delight 
To go up Miss Clanccy for to see. 
A 
grand piano she plays so fine, 
To me she is divine, 
And all those lovely songs she sings to me. 
CHORUS. 
She sings, she sings Sweet Bye and Bye, 
And go to sleep my Baby Mine. 
She sings, she sings such pretty tunes, 
The girl I 
love I'll marry soon. 
There is Owen Smith and Grady, 
The Misses Scott and Doyle, 
Sitting in the parlor all so fine. 
Sure Smithy has comical talk, 
And such a 
funny walk, 
Which causes all the party for to smile. 
When Miss Clancey does appear 
Such curious things you'll hear, 
" 
Miss Clancey, dear, you're looking all serene," 
She smiles and bows her head, 
To the piano she lightly treads, 
And all those loyely songs she sings to me.

There Never was a 
Coward Where the Shamrock 
Grows. 
Respectfully dedicated to Fayette Welsh, and sung with great 
success by Edwin Talbot in his Parlor entertainments. 
Let cowardly slanderers say what they may, 
Against the dear land of my birth; 
But I 
will maintain in spite of all foes, 
It's the dearest green spot on this earth. 
Some say we are cowards and fit for naught else 
But drinking our home-made potheen 
But I'll throw back the villainous lie in their face, 
We're as brave as the shamrock is green. 
CHORUS. 
Pat may be foolish and very often wrong, 
Pat's got a 
temper which don't last very long, 
Pat is full of jollity as everybody knows. 
But there never was a 
coward where the shamrock grows. 
Tho' oppress'd and insulted for hundreds of years 
By the foe who once conquered them, they 
Have left us the courage our forefather's had— 
For that they cannot take away. 
They kept learning from us, stole all we hold dear, 
And crushed us till others cried shame; 
But in spite of it all we have struggled to learn 
That courage and wit are the same.

happy day;

looking at the lads and the lasses on the green, 
'Neath the fine old hills of Scotland far away. 
I've looked for her coming, but she's not come as yet, 
The truth seems to dawn on me plain ; 
They say she is false but I'll still believe her mine, 
She's my darling blue-eyed Scotch lassie Jean. 
0 Jean, my dearest Jean ! 
Come to your laddie once again ; 
They say you are false. but I'll still believe you mine, 
You're my darling blue-eyed Scotch lassie Jean. 
She said she soon would meet me, but I've waited long,in 
vain, 
In lands far away she doth roam; 
Her promise she will keep, 0 ! break it not, my Jean, 
We'll be happy in our bonnie little home. 
Then let me not long wait, let me meet you soon, my Jean, 
And Heav'n will then smile on our love ; 
And when life is ended, we'll leave this earthly scene, 
When our hearts will dwell in joy and bliss above. 
0 
Jean, my clearest Jean ! 
Come to your lacIdie once again; 
They say you are false, but I'll still believe you mine. 
You're my darling blue-eyed Scotch lassie Jean.

'When the force I'd have to lave.

So give to me that precious boon—

Friendship, ' tis said, is but a

All through this world of strife ;

In the grip of an honest man.

I'll Bet You a 
Dollar You Don't, 
Sung with great success by EDWIN BARRY. 
Does any one know what I'm going to say ? 
I'll bet you a 
dollar you don't. 
If I 
lose the wager, will any one pay, 
I'll bet you a 
dollar you don't. 
Gay bachelors say they shall never take wives, 
For as each in his way to be happy contrives, 
They mean to keep single the rest of their lives. 
But I'll bet you a 
dollar they don't. 
Find an Irish election without any row, 
I'll bet you a 
dollar you don't, 
Or a 
sin l 
who objects to a 
mistletoe bough, 
I'll bet you a 
dollar you don't. 
Some years of experience teaches me this— 
That from seven to ninety both Mrs. and Miss 
May refuse you this ancient excuse for a 
kiss. 
But I'll bet you a 
dollar they don't. 
You may see vaccination a 
thing of the past, 
I'll bet you a 
dollar you don't. 
And heavy taxation abolished at last, 
I'll bet you a 
dollar you don't. 
You may see old John Bull dwindle down to a 
calf, 
And his provender nothing but foreigners' chaff. 
You may see all the ladies too quiet by half, 
But I'll bet you a 
dollar you don't. 
Some ignorant croakers wear visages long, 
Will you bet me a 
dollar they don't ? 
And say that to visit amusement is wrong, 
Will you bet me a 
dollar they don't ? 
Though to succor distress they can never afford, 
Above human vices they always have soared, 
Still somehow they know every move on the board, 
Will you bet me a 
dollar they don't? 
A 
married man often tries to prove cock-o'-the-walk, 
But I'll bet you a 
dollar he don't. 
If he tries to sleep when his wife wants to talk, 
I 
shall bet him two dollars he don't. 
So all you young girls, please attend to this verse, 
And go and get married for better or worse, 
And two little armfuls you may have to nurse, 
affon't bet a 
dollar you don't.

Together with their friends and their ladies, the daisies, 
Invited guest whose hearts are blessed with all the beer

And so around we balance, and each daisy is crazy 
Wid great hilarity, all at the Twilight Coterie.

Written and sung by Charles H. Duncan. 
Copyrighted by

All through this world are many things 
That puzzle and perplex, 
And many of us find in life occurrences that vex. 
The high, the low, the rich, the poor_ 
Meet equal in the end, 
Though some may sneer and put on airs, 
With what good luck may send, 
Yet he who takes us by the hand 
And wishes us success 
We'll not forget in future, though 
His fortune may grow less; 
We'll try to aid him, cheer him 
Upward, onward to the end, 
For should reverses come to us 
He'll not forget a 
friend. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! don't forget a 
friend, 
Pray, don't forget a 
friend; 
Let this your motto be through life, 
Pray don't forget a

The drunkard whom you pass with scorn 
Was once respected, too, 
And when a 
child, a 
mother's love 
He had, as well as you. 
When money filled his pockets 
He was hail good fellow then, 
But now, that all his cash 
Has flown, forgotten by most men. 
But now that all his cash has flown, 
Forgotten by most men. 
Let this a 
lesson be to you: 
Be temperate in all things, 
And give you' fellowman a 
lift, 
Whom err misfortune brings, 
You cannot tell fr in day to day 
What others they may sena. 
Let this your motto be through life 
gray don't forget a

carpet bag. 
I 
know ' twill be a 
task, an unpleasant thing to ask 
Your ears, but pray don't let your spirits flag, 
And I'll endeavor to explain, yes, each article will name 
I 
saw within James Gordon Bennett's bag. 
l'here was reports of the Brooklyn scandal, and a 
symphony 
wrote by Handel; 
Letters from the only girl he ever loved ; 
A 
pair of Harry Miner's dirty socks, wrapped in a 
note from 
" 
Sunset" Cox ; 
A package of " queer " that some young gounoff shoved ; 
Elizabeth Tilton's last confession, an article on secession, 
While tied iip in Dr. Mary Walker's old suspenders 
Was a document rather suspicious, looking old and quite 
j 
udicious, 
Containing accounts of Senator Conkling's secret benders ; 
Then a 
poem by deacon Smith . without either rhyme or pith; 
A new-fangled way to play the game of tag; 
A 
picture of President Hayes lacing Victoria Woodhull's stays, 
I 
saw within James Gordon Bennett's bag. 
There was the long lost Charlie Ross with Jack Aber/o on a 
hoss, 
Making love to Tennie Claflin on the sly; 
Old Ben Butler on a 
stump Potter's committee trying to pump, 
Senator Thurman he was chanting " Root hog or die." 
Owney Geoghan he was caught doing things he hadn't ought, 
Billy Sexton with a 
broken billiard cue. 
He was stirring a 
pot of soup for a 
girl who had the croup, 
Who rejoices in the name of Duck- foot Sue; 
Muldoon the solid man he had joined a 
Scottish clan, 
Little Mack was holding Bonner's bobtail nag ; 
But what caused by brain to whirl was Pastors Coney Island 
girl, 
Dancing the can-can in James Gordon Bennett's bag,

In all the festive glory 
Of gay flags and banners bright, 
The merry picnic barge is drifting, 
Thro' the starry night; 
And borne across the waters 
Come sounds of music sweet, 
And merry laugh, and joyous shout, 
And pat of tripping feet, oh! 
CHORUS. 
On the picnic barge they dance, 
In the moonlight soft they dance, 
Down the river 
free, 
To rich music's melody ; 
'Round the deck the merry feet, 
In a 
jolly measure beat, 
Whirl and glide, as down with the tide, 
On the barge they lightly dance. 
A vision of rare beauty, 
Floating gently down the stream, 
Thro' plashing waters silvered 
By each brilliant moonlight beam. 
A time for joy and pleasure, 
For merry dance and song, 
A time to tell love's sweetest story, 
While we drift along. 
On the picnic barge, &Q.

I 
wish my love and I 
was sailing, 
As far from land as far could be, 
Far, far across the deep blue water, 
Where I'd have none to trouble me. 
CHORUS— 
Sweet Maggie Gordon you are my bride, 
Come sit you down upon my knee, 
And tell to me the very reason 
Why I 
am slighted thus by thee. 
The sea is deep, I 
can't swim over. 
Neither have I 
the wings to fly, 
But I 
will hire some jolly sportsman, 
To carry o'er my love and I. 
Sweet Maggie Gordon, 8ro. 
I 
wish I 
had a 
glass of brandy, 
The reason I 
will tell to thee, 
Because when drinking, I 
am thinking, 
Does my true love remember me. 
Sweet Maggie Gordon, eCe.

Goose with. the Golden Egg. 
Writteh, by Bobby Newcomb and sung by Chas. H. Dun-
can, with the Bergers, season 188o--1. 
When I 
was of age my father he left 
To me quite a 
sung little sum ; 
He said, my dear boy, good sense please employ, 
And remember you've reached twenty-one. 
My friends when they heard of what had occurred, 
How they hastened to borrow or beg; 
For I 
flew a 
high kite, and they said, when in sight— 
He's the goose with the golden egg. 
To my utmost surprise I 
attracted all eyes, 
And persons inquired my name, 
Who a 
few months before had pronounced me a 
bore, 
Of my dress and my features made game, 
But they'd laugh when I'd joke,with me drink,dine or smoke 
To my face they were dumb as a 
keg; 
But when I'd turn my back how the'd laugh and the'd clack 
At the goose with the golden egg. 
Now the girls all so fair, admired my hair, 
It was auburn—before it was red ; 
They spoke of my style, drooped their eyes when I'd smile, 
And mamas marked me fit to be wed. 
Their daughters all sighed, and some their hair dyed, 
I 
was loved by Jane, Martha and Meg; 
My presents they took, and they all tried to hook— 
The poor goose with the golden egg. 
But a 
day came at last, I'd been living too fast, 
Run in debt and my money all flown, 
My friends when I'd call let me wait in the hall, 
And a 
message I'd get " Not at home." 
They giggled and jeered where'er I 
appeared, 
Pass me by with a 
nod or a 
sneer; 
For the goose it was dead, and the egg turned to lead, 
I 
had bought my experience dear. 
This subject of rhyme may just be in time, 
For the world—but I 
don't care a 
peg; 
But what I 
would say—I 
was once in my day. 
A poor goose with a 
golden egg.

I'm Waltzingham McSweeney, 
A man well known to fame, 
I'm a 
shining light at all the clubs, 
I'm a 
man of pluck and game. 
I'm the best known man on Broadway, 
On account of my form and face, 
And the stylish way I 
carry myself, 
With a 
walk of air and grace, 
I'm the one you can't help notice, 
I'm a 
man of splendid parts, 
I've a 
high-born education, 
I'm decomplished in all the arts 
I 
can swim like Captain Boynton, 
I 
can walk a 
Highland fling, 
I 
can pull a 
boat with Hanlon, 
I'm a 
crack shot on the wing. 
WALTZINGHAM MCSWEENEY.—CONTINUED. 
CHORUS. 
Waltzingham McSweeney, 
That's the cognomen I 
bear, 
The ladies admire my pretty shape 
And aristocratic air, 
The swells they all get jealous, 
When the dashing girls at me lear, 
For my graceful glide in the ball-room, 
I'm called the gay cavalier. 
I'm a 
great pedestrian walker, 
My record dates far back, 
I'd be sure to beat O'Leary, 
If they'd let me on the track, 
I'm known at all the races, 
My bets are all the boast, 
I 
can always name the winning horse, 
Before he leaves the post, 
All politicians seem to know me, 
They shake my hand with pride, 
For they know my great influence 
In elections turn the tide. 
All the Congressmen and Senators, 
Admire me everywhere, 
And Waltzingham McSweeney, 
Some say will be your Mayor. 
Chorus. 
Words and music by Edwin Talbot. 
Sung with great success by 
Fayette Welsh. 
I'd like 'to be a 
sunflower, 
If I 
might be a 
flower, 
My petals closing softly 
At twilight's quiet hour. 
And waking in the morning 
When falls the early dew, 
To welcome heaven's bright sunshine, 
And heaven's bright tear-drops too. 
I'd like to be a 
sunflower, 
If I 
might be a 
flower 
My petals closing softly 
At twilight's quiet hour. 
I 
love the gentle lily, 
It looks so meek and fair, 
But sunflowers I 
love better, 
For they grow every where, 
The lilies bloom so sadly 
In the sunshine or in shower, 8 
But sunflowers still look upward 
However dark the hour.

KILDARE. 
Words by HARRY OSBORNE. 
Music by CHAS. THATCHER. 
Sung by HARRY OSBORNE and FANNY W ENTWORTH. 
HURRAH for dear old Ireland! 
That diamond in the sea. 
We drowned our sorrow, dance and Ovkg, 
Sure we're always full of glee. 
We've heard of other countries, 
Of climes so rich and rare, 
But there cannot be a 
happier home 
Than sweet sunny Kildare. 
CHORUS. 
The dear land of our fathers, 
We are longing to be there, 
To see the Sun-burst rising 
On thy green hills, Kildare. 
The little sprig of Shamrock, 
It proves but one in three, 
Springing from dear Erin's soil, 
That plant of liberty. 
St. Patrick, he revered it, 
So let this be our prayer, 
That the emblem of our country 
May wave triumphant in the air. 
CHORUS. 
The dear land of our fathers, 
We are longing to be there, 
To see again the emerald hills 
Of our native home, Kildare.

Kicking Mule. 
Copyrighted, 1879, by A. J. 
FISHER, 24 Vesey St., N. Y. 
Originally sung by BILLY CARTER. 
There was a 
little kicking man, 
His name was Simon Slick, 
He owned a 
mule with dreamy eyes, 
And how that mute could kick. 
He'd shut one eye and shake his tail, 
And greet you with a 
smile, 
Then gently telegraph his leg, 
And raise you half a 
mile. 
CHORUS. 
This mule was a 
kicker, 
He'd raise you up slicker, 
And knock you down quicker 
Than Baxter street liquor, 
He eat like a 
micker, 
A 
hungry bill sticker, 
As a 
kicker, no quicker 
Could ever be found. 
His skin was gutta percha, 
And his hoof was hard as lead, 
He'd lift • 
like a 
feather too, 
And at, 
d 
you on your head, 
He'd kick as quick as lightning, 
And he had an iron jaw, 
He was j 
3t the thing to have around 
To tar__e your mother-in-law. 
CHORUS. 
His hoof would amaze ye 
And make you feel hazy, 
How nice he could raise ye 
And knock you clean crazy. 
This mule was a 
daisy, 
Although he was lazy, 
This daisy so lazy 
Could kick like a 
steer. 
RICKING MULE. 
(Continued.) 
He-bit a 
Thomas cat in two, 
And pulverized a 
hog, 
He dissected seven Chinamen, 
And mash'd a 
yaller dog, 
He kicked the stuffing from a 
goose, 
And broke a 
nigger's back, 
And stopped an Erie railway train, 
And kicked it off the track. 
His shoes they were rusty, 
His temper was crusty, 
His eyes they were musty, 
His tail it was dusty, 
His shape would disgust ye, 
He'd kick till he'd bust ye, 
He was musty and dusty, 
And rusty also. 
He'd stop a 
steamboat with his head, 
And kick it out of sight, 
He'd kick a 
boarding house apart 
At twelve o'clock at night. 
The boarders in their short stop clothes (suits), 
They stood and held their breath, 
When he rammed his hind legs down his throat 
And kicked himself to death. 
CHORUS. 
This mule he was spunky, 
He'd climb like a 
monkey 
And bray like a 
donkey, 
You bet he was bunkey. 
Although he was chunkey, 
No fool or no flunkey 
Played him for a 
monkey, 
Or donkey, oh, no.

Kiss Me Good Bye, Darling. 
As sung by JOIM 0. LIME, in Ban Francisco, Cal 
Gently the moon mounts the sky, 
Stars their nightwatch do keep, 
And why let those tears dim thine eye? 
Thine were not made, love, to weep. 
Look up and tell me you love me, 
Grief nearly breaks my poor heart, 
Smile once again in mine eye, 
Then kiss me, Ms me, ere we part. 
CHORUS. 
Good bye, darling, goodbye, 
Do not grieve or miss me, 
I 
must go; I 
leave you weeping, 
Bo good by darling, kiss me. 
Farewell my loved one, my own, 
Oh, but be true unto me, 
Soon will my life bark be thrown 
Out on the tempest at sea. 
I'm going, my darling, I 
love thee, 
Lips speak the love of the heart, 
Smile once again ere I 
go, 
Then kiss me, kiss me, ere we part, 
(Chorus.) 
198th Street. 
As sung by Ernns and BONIFACE, the Funny Irish Comedians. 
You heard the song of the Boulevard, 
For to go there you must have a 
card, 
Where a 
poor man has to work so hard, 
From daylight in the morning. 
We once for a 
man did vote, 
He gave us a 
bit of a 
note, 
And on the back of it was wrote: 
"198th street." 
CHORUS. 
With your shovels and picks and clubs and sticks, 
And stones and bricks, and all such tricks 
We are good for nix, and we are heartily sick 
Of i98th street. 
They put two shovels in our hand, 
Told us to go dig up the land; 
But says we to ourselves, 
We see ye hanged to work upon ye railway. 
Sure then they cut down our pay 
To a 
dollar and sixty cents a 
day; 
But we see them to the devil 
Up in 198th street. 
With your shovels, &c. 
At night when we lay down to sleep, 
The Yankee bugs does over us creep, 
And divil a 
wink they leave us sleep 
Till daylight in the morning. 
In the morning when we rise, 
We rub our sleepy eyes; 
And where do you think we flys, 
But to i98th street. 
With your shovels, &c.

In 
martial array we see each day 
Our soldiers on parade, 
With music sweet and tramping feet, 
Bright uniforms arrayed. 
But I 
know a 
soldier fair, 
Who is handsome, brave and gay, 
The ladies faint with love's complaint 
When he gets in their way. 
CHORUS. 
Major Majolica, be is a 
rolllicker, 
Brave and handsome, dashing and gay, 
lie is a 
stifler, and such a 
trifler, 
The major is mashing the ladies all day. 
[Repeat Chorus.] 
When cannons go off he gives a 
laugh, 
Says, " Load ' em and go it again !" 
When bullets are thick he always is quick 
To escape any danger or pain. 
Ile draws his sword, says " Onward, boys !" 
And then goes to the rear. 
The girls would die, or else they'd sigh, 
IC they lost the major dear.

Composed by NED OLIVER. Dedicated to Jowl F. FIELDS. 
My grandfather Ben had an old Shanghai hen 
Who laid eggs the size of a 
keg; 
She stood six feet high, from her foot to her thigh, 
And she measured one yard around the leg. 
She had an old rooster, her company for to keep, 
But at last he was killed and served fried, 
And she stopped, short, never to lay again, 
When the Shanghai Rooster died. 
CHORUS. 
No more fresh eggs in the morning, chick, chick, chick7anck, 
The breakfast table adorning, chick, chick, chick, chick; 
But stopped, short, never to lay again, 
When the Shanghai Rooster died. 
In roaming around the farm the old hen took delight. 
And when evening's shades began to fall 
She'd hop up on the roof with the rest of the gang, 
Or stay out with her shanghai on the wall. 
But when daylight did appear, to the corn patch they 
would steer, 
And they would gobble up worms side by side 
But she stopped, short never to gobble again, 
When the Shanghai Rooster died 
FAREWELL, ALANNA. 
Written by ROBERT MCKAY, 
'Farewell, alanna! farewell, asthore, 
Think of me sometimes, should we meet no more, 
And when at night at your bedside you pray, 
Don't forget him who's beyond the blue sea, 
Farewell, Oh, how that word pierces my heart, 
Must I 
then leave you—must I 
depart, 
Never to see you, to speak to pm more, 
Farewell, alanna! farewell, asthore! 
CHORUS. 
With sorrow, acushla, my cup's flowing o'er, 
Farewell, alanna! farewell, asthore. 
Farewell, alanna! farewell, asthore, 
To friends and to kindred and scenes loved of yore, 
Oft when in silence and sadness I 
mourn, 
To Erin and you shall my spirit return, 
Still in your heart darling let me reside, 
E'en though in far distant lands I 
abide, 
Still remain true to the vows pledged of yore, 
Farewell, alanna! farewell, asthore.

Flannel Mouth Mick. 
Words and music by BILLY W ELCH, of W ELCH and RICE 
qd respoct 
fully dedicated to M URPHY and M ACK. 
I 
know you'll have pitY 
When you hear what I 
say, 
The way I've been treated 
By the blackguards each day, 
Who stand around the corners 
As I 
pass them by; 
You can hear them say plainly, 
Arrah, stag the old guy. 
CHORUS. 
For they yell out, you terrier, 
Go shoot that hat quick. 
For they call me a 
chaw 
And a 
flannel mouth Mick. 
The other day, while out walking, 
I 
went down the street, 
A 
charming young damsel 
I 
did chance to meet. 
Says I, you look charming, 
A cushla ma vick; 
Says she, go drop on yourself, 
You ould flannel mouth Mick. 
For they yell out, &c. 
When election day comes 
Shure I 
know what they'll say, 
It will be, Mr. McGinnis, 
How are you to-day? 
They'll hand me a 
ticket, 
Say, go vote it now, quick. . 
I'm a 
gentleman then, 
And no flannel mouth Mick. 
For they yell out, &e. 
AIN'T YOU GOT A CHEEK.

Sung 
TONY "'Anon. 
Oh, I 
love a 
maiden, she's fair as can be, 
Her hair is nut brown and her boot No. 3, 
Her zheeks are as red as the blossoming rose, 
Joy follows her footsteps wherever she goes, 
In her is all happiness earth can bestow, 
I 
can't understand why she teases me so, 
For when I 
would kiss her, this sly little puss, 
On ler lips puts her finger and answers me- thus— 
CHORUS. 
Oh, ain't you naughty, to talk to me so, 
No, I 
won't let you, now please let me go, 
I'll be 
mad" and to you I'll never speak, 
You're " horrid," you're " awful," ain't you got 
a 
cheek! 
It's awful, when for a 
caress you're inclined, 
A. maiden should act so unjust and unkind, 
This motive alone she can have I 
am sure, 
The Dower received will be valocci the more, 
And thus they're so artful and clothing the elves, 
When we know they would 
like to" as well as 
ourselves, 
And so I'm perplexed and the point I 
can't see, 
-When covered with blushes she cries out to me— 
Cnonus.—Oh, ain't you naughty, to talk to me so, etc. 
Some day we'll be married, Oh, thrice happy day 
Then all affectation will be cast away, 
Then I 
shall enfold her in these loving arms, 
And shield her forever from earth's wild alarms, 
Joy, joy then shall reign in this bosom supreme, 
Life then will be real, not a 
delusive dream, 
I'll kiss her, caress her, do just as I 
please, 
And will not be amazed by such words as these— 
cuouus.—Oh, ain't you naughty, to talk to Ines°, etc.

There's a 
place o'er the sea 
Where my boyhood was spent, 
With the friend of my youth, 
I, indeed was content. 
I 
have roamed through the world, 
But my heart's beating still, 
Foi the friends of my boyhood 
On Wicklow's Green Hill. 
CHORUS. 
On Wicklow's Green Hill 
My heart's beating still, 
For the friends of my boyhood, 
On Wicklow's Green Hill. 
I 
crossed the wide ocean 
To this glorious land, 
And found here a 
welcome 
With friendship's warm hand, 
Extended to me with honest good will, 
So much like my own friends 
On Wicklow's Green Hill. 
On Wicklow's Green Hill, &c, 
But my father and mother, 
Are both growing old, 
My presence would cheer them, 
By their letters I'm told. 
I'll hasten away my duty to fill, 
To my kind loving parents 
On Wicklow's Green Hill. 
On Wicklow's Green Hill, &c. 
Then farewell Columbia, 
To thy ever free shore, 
I 
leave thee my blessing 
Should I 
ne'er see thee more; 
I'll sing in thy praise, 
And respect thee until, 
I 
sleep my last sleep 
Qn Wicklow's Green IIill.

ttineriean Fortune-Telling Cards.-This is thetold-
est and most widely known pack of Fortune-Telling Cards. We have 
published it for years, and the demand is continually increasing. 
These Cards are arranged and printed in series-Hearts, Clubs, Dia, 
monde and Spades-and each of these into K for King, Q for Queen, 
and K 
for Knave, and numbers 1, 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
four rows, and are to be read according to directions. 
Many of the an-
swers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under. 
standing. Many professional Fortune-Tellers use these cards, and we 
are in receipt of letters in relation to them from all parts of the U. S.

Courting Cards.- This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people-a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such e, way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by 
linemen who are either too diffi-
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unladylike encourage-
:, ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. 
This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes a 
further explanation nn-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties
