AG: Thank you so much for participating in the Library of Congress Oral histories.  Can I ask 
you to introduce yourself, Maria? 
 
MR: Sure.  My name is Maria Lucia Rojas, and I am currently living in Tampa, Florida.  I work 
at the James A.  Haley VA.  I’ve been a veterans VA nurse for the last 14 years now, most of the 
time I've been working in the Medical ICU.  Just this last year, I made a change and went into 
our Admission Surge Unit which helps to decompress the emergency room in between - they 
come into the ER, and then before they can go up to the floor, they come to us so that we can get 
everything started while they wait for a bed upstairs.  So, we get them situated and then they 
move upstairs.  Well, about four months ago, our unit was closed down due to the pandemic and 
so that we could assist in administering vaccines.  So, for the last four months now, I've been 
administering vaccines and we normally give anywhere between 1,500 and 2,000 vaccines today.  
So we've been doing really well, as far as that’s concerned. 
 
AG: So, where were they administering the vaccines?  Did they have to set up, like, a tent or 
something outside?  I've heard that’s been the case in some places. 
 
MR: Well, when we first started, we had a large auditorium and we worked within the 
auditorium because we started with our - basically World War II vets.  We still have a lot of 88 
to 90, you know, 98, 99, we even had one that was 102 years old that came in.  So we started 
with that population after we had vaccinated the staff, of course.  So, once we managed to get all 
of them vaccinated, we noticed that where we were working was too small, so we moved it 
downstairs to where we had three dining rooms down in the Spinal Cord Unit, and we opened up 
all three.  So we could run anywhere between 12 and 20 - yeah, it was about 20 stations, and we 
were really moving a lot of veterans through at that point.  Well, about, I’d say, two weeks ago, 
we found that if - in collaboration with Hillsborough County, we started vaccinating the 
community also along with our veterans, so that that way we could vaccinate our family 
members, our spouses, our caregivers, and their children.  And that was one of the ways that the 
VA ensured that we could vaccinate our veterans’ family members, in order to keep our veterans 
healthy.  So we collaborated with the University of South Florida, and now we have a large 
operation that is basically a drive thru.  We have everything set up nicely, they have to drive 
through these big, huge tents and then they wait for 15 minutes while we have nurses on the 
other end monitoring, and we tell them that if anything should happen within those 15 minutes of 
us monitoring them, they just honk their horn and then somebody goes over there and sees about 
them.  So it's a very well-run organization as far as getting people vaccinated.  So, yeah, we've 
gone from starting within the building to going outside in collaboration with Hillsborough 
County. 
 
AG: How many patients can you vaccinate, typically, in a day? 
 
MR: On a daily basis, once we started vaccinating the community, we can vaccinate anywhere 
between 1,600 and a little over 2,000 a day.

AG: Wow.  How long are the shifts for those of you doing these vaccines? 
 
MR: We go into work at six o'clock in the morning and we start vaccinating at 7:00, and we 
normally close down and take the last appointment right about 4:30 in the afternoon, but that still 
gives us time to make sure that anybody who's in the queue can get through and that we have 
those that we have to monitor for, say, half an hour because they've had a severe allergic reaction 
to a medication, that we can monitor them for those 30 minutes afterwards.  So, normally we'll 
start our day about six o'clock in the morning and it typically will end about 5:30, six o'clock, 
sometimes even 7:00.  So we're working 12, 13 hours a day. 
 
AG: How many days a week do you typically work? 
 
[4:53] MR: We're supposed to work three days a week, but with everything that we have to get 
done, we're normally working anywhere between four and five days.  We always get at least two 
days off during the week.  When we first started, we were working six days a week but now it's 
gotten to where we're only working five days, maybe 6, but we're still doing 12 hour shifts. 
 
AG: How do you think that the VA has handled the COVID-19 pandemic, in your experience? 
 
MR: It's been difficult.  I started out - at the beginning of the pandemic, I worked in the ICU.  So, 
when we first got started in the ICU, it was a very difficult transition because not only did we 
have to care for a severely ill patient but now we had to worry about keeping ourselves healthy 
and making sure that we didn't bring this stuff home.  I think that was a big - that played a big 
role in a lot of nurses deciding to leave the profession and to not continue working in those 
critical areas where they were having to deal with COVID patients every day.  We were working 
in shifts.  They would keep us in a A team and a B team, so that way we wouldn't cross-
contaminate.  So, if somebody got sick or they got exposed to COVID, then we would contain it 
to one team and the other one wasn't exposed.  So we did that for about six months, a little over 
six months, and then we had set schedules, we were working three to four days a week.  Then, 
we went in the opposite direction where they went ahead and said, okay, now we're fine, you can 
go ahead and reschedule yourselves, and that's when the COVID cases started to come down a 
little.  Then, the next thing we knew, they started - especially here in Florida, they opened up, I 
felt, was way too soon, so our cases started going back up again.  The transition from, you know, 
we thought everything was going okay, to now having to deal with the surge all over again, it 
still made us have to work even more and I think we were just tired at that point.  You know, you 
just get overwhelmed and it's like, when is this ever going to end?  So, going from that and then 
transitioning over into, where I thought it was going to get a break in the Surge Unit for a little 
while, and then going back into working right in the middle of the pandemic yet again.  You 
know, we're used to working long hours, but the long hours, especially here in Florida, in the 
heat and on your feet all day, that can take a toll.  But we're hoping that within the next two, 
three months we can get a handle on it, and we'll get most of everybody vaccinated, and we can 
go from there, so - but yeah, it's been a transition.

AG: Are there any things that you do to take care of yourself in this incredibly trying time, being 
on the front lines? 
 
MR: Some of the things that I try to do, just to decompress, is I love to take pictures.  So, I'm a 
big photographer, and I've got all of this equipment.  My son, he's also an emergency room 
nurse, a pediatric ER nurse.  So, we would get together and we would go out into - there's so 
many different parks, and so many lakes and areas around here, where we didn't have to worry 
about being around a lot of people.  We were outside, and we were able to just take pictures, and 
just decompress, and enjoy ourselves that way.  And then, my husband and I would go kayaking.  
So, again, we would be out on the water and, you know, that's how I managed to get through.  
And we're blessed enough to live in Florida, that we can be outside and the weather is always 
nice, even on the coldest day, it's really not that cold.  So, you know, that was one of the things 
that really helped me get through, because not being able to see family - we were very restrictive.  
My husband and I restricted ourselves to just being home and staying away from everyone 
because of the fact that I didn't know if I was ever going to bring something in.  I never knew if I 
was, you know, asymptomatic but yet positive.  So we managed to stay away from a lot of 
people for quite a long time, just to make sure that I didn't contaminate anyone or I didn't give 
anyone COVID.  I would have felt so bad had I transmitted anything to anyone, and then they 
weren't going to be able to - if they got really ill with it.  So, that's one of the things that I did in 
order to kind of get through the pandemic. 
 
[10:00] AG: It sounds like being in nature has been restorative. 
 
MR: Oh, absolutely, yeah. 
 
AG: Could we back up a bit and talk about your upbringing, and your early education, and your 
family background? 
 
MR: Oh, sure.  I was born and raised in a little town called Pearsall, Texas.  It's so tiny, it's got 
one stop light and about two blinking lights, and then you're through the town.  So, I graduated 
high school in 1982 with only - I think there was 82 or 83 of us that graduated that year, so that 
just goes to show you how small our community was.  I grew up in a cattle ranch right outside of 
the little town, so I'm basically a - oh, I don't know, I can't say - I guess I was born - you know, I 
was like a ranch hand.  My dad had us out there, doing all kinds of stuff at a very early, early 
age.  We grew our own chickens.  We had our own - every year, we had a huge garden that we 
had all kinds of stuff in, my mom would can it, she’d freeze it, you know, and everything was, 
like, nice and wholesome.  We always ate stuff from - that we grew, basically.  So, we had 
chickens, we had our own eggs, every year we would slaughter a steer, about a 500 pound steer, 
and we would just put the meat in the - take it to get processed and put it in the freezer, so we 
never had to worry about any of that, yeah.  And you can imagine my culture shock when I 
finally left home and I had to go to the grocery store buy a steak when, before, growing up, I 
could just pull it out of the freezer and, you know, it wasn't a big deal.  So, yeah, that's where we 
grew up.  Come from a family of 10, there's 10 of us.  My mom and dad - my grandparents 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship  
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans 
 
7 
immigrated from Mexico, so my mom and dad were basically migrant workers.  As they grew, 
they worked in the fields and my dad was illiterate, he couldn't speak - or, he could understand 
English but he couldn't read it or write it, and my mom had an eighth grade education.  So, one 
of the things that she always told my dad was that her children were going to get an education.  
To her, getting an education was graduating high school.  So, we all took it a little bit - a step 
further, but she did, she managed to get each and every one of us through high school, and she 
felt that, you know, that was her job, and she had completed that.  She also told him that her 
children were never going to be moving around and be migrant workers.  So, that's how he ended 
up getting that job there at the ranch.  My mom was a stay at home mom, and with that many 
children, you know, she - just trying to keep house was enough, and trying to keep track of her 
kids.  But yeah, that's my - in a nutshell, yeah. 
 
AG: Growing up, did you have a favorite subject in school? 
 
MR: Well, my worst subject was math, always, always, always, okay?  That - given, I did not 
like math.  I loved to read.  Growing up, that was my one ability to just leave where I was, and 
where I was - you know, in the situations we would be in, because we - growing up, we were 
very poor.  So, in order to see and explore other things, you would do it through a book.  So, I 
was an avid reader from a very, very young age.  So, English language, that was always my go-
tos.  I loved science, because growing up in that situation and growing up on the ranch, I loved 
working with my dad when it came to the animals, and nursing the animals, and finding out what 
needed to be done in order to keep them healthy, and what we needed to do to get them from 
point A to point B, to get them to the slaughter and make the most money from them.  We also 
had quarter horses on the ranch.  So, if anything ever happened, we would basically doctor our 
own horses.  My dad would call the vet and say, hey, this is what's going on.  And because he'd 
been doing it for so long, the vet would just tell him, oh, you might want to try this, this, and this, 
so that he didn't have to come out.  So I learned a lot, and for me, science in that aspect geared 
more towards the animals, because I always wanted to be a veterinarian.  So, that was my goal at 
that point when I was growing up.  So, English, language arts, and the sciences.  I was never a 
math person, no, that was not me. 
 
[15:15] AG: In addition to all of the outdoor and farm you experienced, did you have 
extracurriculars? 
 
MR: Yeah.  Oh, absolutely.  Growing up, a lot of our socialization was done with our cousins.  
We had a huge extended family, and my aunts and uncles would come over and they would have 
just as many kids.  So we would all be, you know, fishing, and we’d play baseball and, I mean, 
we were always interacting with each other as we were growing up.  Now, as I got older and we 
started in school, then I was really active in the 4H Club and the Future Farmers of America, the 
FFA and FHA and, you know, things of that aspect.  So, I ever since I was a little kid - I think I 
was nine years old when I started showing steers at the livestock show, and we did that - I did 
that my whole entire school career, other than my senior year because I had been so busy in so 
many other things that I just didn't do it anymore.  But, for the most part, extracurricularly, I was 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship  
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans 
 
8 
in the 4H, and the FFA, and the FHA.  I was part of the Drill Team.  I held down a job my junior 
and senior year.  I think it was, like, a job study where you work half the day and you go to 
school the other half of the day, so I did that.  So we were - my mom always kept us really busy 
and really involved so that, that way - she always said, you know, idle hands - you get in trouble 
with idle hands.  So she made sure that we always stayed really busy, and she kept us real 
involved.  Yeah. 
 
AG: Do you remember what led you to pursue nursing early on?  Like, what spurred your 
interest in nursing as a career? 
 
MR: You know, my dad played a big part in that, because when I was in high school, everything 
was geared towards me going to school and becoming a veterinarian.  It was my senior year, and 
my dad says to me - or, I wanted to go to school and he says - I had talked to the counselor and 
we had everything situated so that I could go.  We had all of the scholarships, and we had all the 
financial aid ready, and I was going to go to the University of Texas at Tarleton so that I could 
study vet medicine.  Well, when I approached my dad, he said, no, none of his daughters were 
going to go and get beat up by animals, and that we were not going to pursue that, and that I 
could do anything else I wanted but I wasn't going to do that.  I remember, I was so angry, and - 
but if you know anything about a traditional Mexican family, you never go against your parents, 
and my dad always had a large say in what we did and how we did it.  So there was no way I was 
going to go against his wishes, even though we - I begged and pleaded, and he would not change 
his mind.  Well, I remember one day - and I was always the good kid.  I never got in trouble.  
You know, my sisters always pushed the limits, but I never got in trouble.  I was always, you 
know, yes sir, no sir, and I did everything I was supposed to.  Well, I remember, I went to school 
that day and I was so angry after having had, like, the 50th discussion with him.  I walk in, and 
we were supposed to be having what they called career day, and they had all four branches of the 
Armed Services, they had different colleges that were there, they had about two or three trade 
schools.  So, they had set up the gym so that you could just go around and talk to everyone.  
Well, the year before, in our junior year, they had all pulled - they had pulled every single one of 
us in the senior class, which wasn't a lot, you know, 80 kids, and we all had to take the ASVAB.  
That's the test that you need in order to go into the military, to see, you know, where you excel at 
or if you would even be a candidate for the military.  They had sat us all in there, and we had all 
taken it - we didn't have a choice, everybody had to take it.  [20:02] And then, on career day, 
when the recruiters were there, you could go and you could speak to the recruiters to see if you 
qualified and what you qualified for.  I remember, I was standing there with three or four of my 
girlfriends, and we were laughing about, oh, look at those guys, you know, they're going over to 
the Army and the Marines, they must not have anything else to do with their lives.  And then, I 
look over and I see this lady walk in, and she is just - she looks absolutely phenomenal in that 
military uniform.  Yeah.  She was so well put-together.  She walks in there in her little Air Force 
uniform, and she sets up her little table.  I remember, I walked over and I said, “So, what do I 
have to do to wear one of those uniforms?” And she starts laughing, and she says, “Well, let me 
tell you,” and we went through all of the requirements, and she looked up, and she says, “Oh, 
you passed everything with flying colors.  Now, all we need to do is get you into San Antonio to 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship  
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans 
 
9 
go get you to take your physical, and then we can go from there.”  And I was like, okay.  So, I 
ditched school - something I had never done in my life - I ditched school, and I went to San 
Antonio, and I took my physical, and I passed.  She says, “Okay.  Well, now all you have to do 
is, if this is what you want to do, go ahead, sign right here.”  I was 18, I just turned 18, so I was 
like, okay.  So I signed on the dotted line, I raised my hand and went to the delayed enlistment 
program, and now I had to tell my parents, okay?  So I remember, I kept it to myself for a while.  
This was in March, late March, and we were getting ready to graduate in May.  So, at the end of 
April, she calls - the recruiter calls my home, and my mom answers the phone, and she asked to 
speak to me.  My mom asked her who she was, and she told her, you know, and I remember, my 
mom gave me the dirtiest look.  She called to tell me that I had a date of June 15th to go into 
basic training, and I was like, okay.  I remember, I hung up the phone, now I had to tell my 
parents.  So, that's how my - the initial track, getting me out of the veterinary medicine and going 
into the military.  Yeah.  Eight years later - I spent a little over eight years in.  Mm-hmm. 
 
AG: What was your role in the Air Force? 
 
MR: When I went into the Air Force, I became what they called a personnel specialist.  We did 
all the paperwork, as far as people coming and going to different bases, promotions, testing, 
anything having to do with - if someone got in trouble, we would do all of their paperwork.  If 
they were being separated from the military, whether it be good or bad, we did that paperwork.  
We kept track of everyone that was on the base and all of their records, so that was basically our 
job.  That was our non-wartime job.  And then, we were all detailed out, you know, for our 
wartime jobs in case anything should happen.  Well, that job, for me, entailed being on the team 
that arrived at whatever location we were going.  We got there first, along with what they called 
the Red Horse, which is our civil engineers who would set up the base, and we would keep track 
of everybody that was arriving so that we knew every single person who was there, what their 
job was, what their rank was, and what base they came from.  Because if anything happened to 
them - and this is a morbid way of saying it, but we would bag, tag and replace.  So, if somebody 
died, we knew who they were, what their rank was, and where they came from, so we were able 
to send a message out to that particular organization, letting them know that their person was 
gone and we would be sending him home.  And then, we would go on a search for that same type 
of individual, we needed the same rank, the same job, in order to replace them, so - and that's 
what we did. 
 
AG: What years was that? 
 
MR: ’82 to ’90.  Mm-hmm. 
 
AG: During your service, did you deploy?  Were you stationed abroad?  How did that work? 
 
[24:39] MR: No.  I was very lucky in that aspect, because I got out right before the first Iraq 
conflict.  My husband, actually, was getting ready to go over there, but he had left - he worked 
on the - he was a crew chief on the flight line, and he had just left to go to school.  He was on en 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship  
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans 
 
10 
route to school, and at the time there was no cell phones, so we would have to wait until he 
stopped for the evening to call home so that I could talk to him.  Well, they called me - they 
called our home, and they said, “Is he still there?” I was like, “No, he's already gone.  You know, 
it's a three day drive, so he left a little early to make sure that if anything happened to the car, or 
whatever, that he would still make it in time,” and - because they were going to pull him back 
and send him over.  And then, by the time they did reach him, he had already checked into the 
next duty station to start school, so they were like, you know what, don't even worry about it.  
So, we were both very lucky in that aspect.  Yeah. 
 
AG: And you met your husband while in the service? 
 
MR: I did.  I was stationed in San Antonio for two years, and then, from there I went to the 
Philippines for five.  That's where I met my husband, had both my children, and came home a 
ready-made family.  We arrived in Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson, Arizona, and we 
were there, and that's when I went ahead and separated from the military, at that time. 
 
AG: What did you do next? 
 
MR: I went back to school, and I got an associate’s degree in youth and family counseling, 
hoping that I would be able to use that wherever we went.  So, I was working there in Tucson - I 
was working at two different youth shelters.  These children were teenagers who are at risk 
because they had been taken from their parents and they were jumping from foster home to foster 
home, or they would run away.  So we were just, like, a stopgap until they could find another 
placement.  Some of them would be there with us for a couple of days, some of them were there 
for a couple months, depending on how hard they were to be placed.  I did that until we left 
Tucson and went to Georgia.  Once I arrived in Georgia, I couldn't find a job.  So, we had been 
there about two weeks and I started working at a little local convenience store that was just, like, 
right up the road, and my husband said don't do it, I don't want you working there.  I was like, 
well, I have to contribute in some manner until I can get back to school or find something a little 
better.  It's right there, it closes at midnight, it's not that big of a deal, you know, it's only six 
hours, four days a week, it's something, just to help out.  On his birthday, I'll never forget, it was 
March 14th.  I had gone in, and they called me into go work because somebody called in sick.  I 
went in, and I was working, not a problem.  There was these two gentleman that were always in 
the store with us, and they would be there, you know, from early in the morning until we closed 
at night, I never thought anything of it.  They were just - like, you know, it was a tiny little town 
in South Georgia called Sparks, Georgia.  We lived in Adel, which was, like, right next door, but 
I had never worked in this particular - I worked in the Adel store, I never worked in the one in 
Sparks, but the one in Sparks is one that they needed help in.  So I went over there, and my 
husband and the boys brought me dinner that night.  Right about midnight, when I was getting 
ready to close, I thought I heard something outside by the gas pumps.  So I called the local 
police, and I said, “Hey, can you do me a favor and just come sit out here while I lock up and get 
in the car and go home?” And they're like, yeah, we'll send somebody.  So it got to be 12:10, 
12:15, and nobody showed up, and I'm like, I’ve got to get home, because if I don't, my 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship

11 
husband's going to start to worry.  So I went ahead and I closed everything down, and I started 
walking out of the store, and I remember locking the store.  And then, the next thing I know, I'm 
walking towards the car because the car was parked right in front of - my husband had moved in, 
and parked it right in front.  He said, “You know, I don't like the looks of this place.  Let me just 
move it and park it right front of the door.”  So, we parked there in front of the door.  I'm 
leaving, and I remember putting the key in the door, and all of a sudden I heard somebody 
behind me, and I turned around and I saw this guy with this orange ski mask and this big, huge 
butcher knife.  And I had a bag - you know, those little plastic bags, and it had a Gatorade in it, 
because my oldest wasn't feeling well, so I was taking some Gatorade.  The next thing I know, 
I'm backing up, and I'm trying to run backwards, and I'm screaming, and this guy is coming 
towards me and he says, “Shut up and get in the car, shut up and get in the car.”  I was like, 
“You're going to have to kill me first, because I'm not getting in the car.”  I remember, I swung 
the bag and I hit him twice before the bag broke, and the Gatorade went once place, and the 
silverware and the stuff my husband brought went the other direction.  But by this time, the 
neighbors had heard all the screaming, and the lights were coming on.  [29:59] He came down at 
me with the knife, and remember I fell backwards.  He came down at me with the knife, and I 
reached up with my left hand, and the knife embedded in between my thumb and my forefinger, 
and I closed down on it, and when he went up, we kind of - I don't know how it happened, but I 
ended up with the knife embedded in my hand, and he ended up with the handle in his, so it 
broke.  I'm screaming, and kicking, and hollering, and then the neighbors are starting to wake up, 
and he took off at that point.  So, by then they had called the police.  So the police were there, the 
paramedics were there, but they were so insensitive because the first thing they wanted to do - 
I've already almost been raped, and now you're just, like, pulling up my clothes without even 
trying to tell me what's going on?  So I was freaking out, they finally - I get in the back of the 
ambulance, they take me to the little local hospital, it’s this tiny little hospital, and they're like, 
you know, what happened?  Where do you live?  We had only been there two months, I couldn't, 
for the life of me, remember my address.  And it was such a small community, the police officer 
is like, that's that new military family that just, you know, moved into - and he said the address.  
I said, yeah, that's us, that's us.  And he says, “Do you want me to tell your husband?” And all I 
could think of was, no way, he's going to be so mad, because he told me not to work there to 
begin with.  And then, they're like, well, we need to do something about your hand.  I'm like, 
you're not touching me either, and they're like, forget it.  So they went and got my husband, and 
the next thing I know, I see him coming down the hallway.  As I'm seeing him coming down the 
hallway, it's like, I let out this sigh of relief.  At the same time, I felt somebody give me 
something in my arm just to calm me down.  I was like, really, you just did that?  So, just, that 
whole experience and everything that they did, and from there - well, my husband took me to the 
base and they had to do - had to go in, and they - by the time I got to the base - let me tell you, 
the military is the best.  By the time I got to the base, the orthopedic surgeon was there, the social 
worker was there, his commander was there, and so was the chaplain.  So, from the time that the 
little hospital called them and told them that we were on our way was only half an hour, and they 
were already there waiting for us when we arrived.  So, I can - there's never enough good things 
that I can say for the Air Force in that aspect.  And then, my husband had to stay home with me 
for almost 30 days, because I could not - you couldn’t turn the lights out.  I couldn't go out by 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship  
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans 
 
12 
myself.  I was like, I’m leaving, I don't care what you say or do, I'm leaving this place, I'm not 
staying.  And he finally - he's like, we have to do something, you're going to have to do 
something.  He says, “Do you remember when we were in the hospital, and there was a sign on 
the door that they were looking for CNAs and they were going to be holding a CNA class?” He 
says, “Why don't you go enroll in that?  Just get your mind off of this and see what - you know, 
if that's something that you want to do.”  So, my hand - I just had surgery on my hand, so my 
hand was still bandaged up.  I went over there, and sure enough, I joined their CNA class.  Let 
me tell you, that was my segue into nursing and I fell in love with every aspect of nursing from 
there, but it had to take something very bad to happen in order for me to get put on this path. 
 
AG: Wow. 
 
MR: Yeah. 
 
AG: It sounds like it must have been so terrifying, and yet you kept your wits about you and 
managed to defend yourself.  I can imagine that must have been traumatic. 
 
MR: It was.  It was.  And, you know, I think the only reason that I was able to not get in that 
vehicle is because I had seen so many different - the Air Force always tells you and, you know, 
gives you a lot of self-defense classes, and tells you the dos and don'ts.  Especially, being in so 
many different places, and even being in the Philippines, you have to go through this cultural 
awareness class, and this is what you need to be aware of, and this is how you would handle it.  I 
think a lot of that - one of the first things they always tell you is, you never get in a vehicle with 
somebody.  If something's going to happen to you, it's going to happen to you whether you're 
there but if they have the opportunity to take you someplace else, guaranteed you're not going to 
come out of it alive.  So I think that, to me, was - if I'm going to die, you're going to do it right 
here because there's no way I'm going to get in that car, because the minute I get in that car, I'm 
doomed anyway.  So I think that's what made me fight as hard as I did and refuse to get in the 
vehicle.  I didn't trust the police, first of all, because I called and asked you to come and you 
didn't.  I called them not once, but twice.  And then, sure, I'm bleeding, but can you ask me 
where I'm bleeding instead of, you know, tearing up my clothes and seeing if I've got any other 
puncture wounds.  [35:08] Now I can stop and think, well, maybe my adrenaline was running so 
high that I hadn't realized I had been stabbed anywhere else, but I knew that the only place that 
he had gotten me was in my hand, so you might have asked me that question, you know?  Then I 
get to the hospital, and you're going to blind side me and sedate me with - you know without 
even asking?  So yeah, it was a very tiny hospital in South Georgia that probably didn't have a lot 
of training.  So I have to attribute it to that also. 
 
AG: And at this time you moved into working as a Certified Nursing Assistant, CNA, in long-
term care? 
 
MR: Yes, I did, actually.  I did.  Right after I got done with the CNA class, the owners in that 
little town - the owners of the hospital and the nursing home in that town - would train their own 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship  
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans 
 
13 
staff, and then they would hire them.  So I started working in the long-term care area, and I loved 
it.  The nurse that was there working with me, she saw the potential in me, so she would teach 
me some of the nursing roles, and she would push me into trying to do other things.  She says, 
“You know, you're way too educated and have way too much talent to just be a CNA.”  She says, 
“Why don't you go look into the local,” - it was a technical school at the time - “and see if you 
can't get into their nursing classes.”  So, I was a very sour person at that time because of 
everything that happened to me, so I was still trying to transition, and I knew that we weren't 
going to be there for very long, because being in the military, every two, three years they move 
us someplace else.  So I remember going up into the technical school, and I said, “I'd like to go 
into your nursing program,” and they tell me that there's a two year waiting list.  And I said, 
“You know what?” I said, “I'm not going to wait two years.”  I said, “I know, for a fact, that you 
have to have certain amount of minorities in your classes.”  I said, “This is a very small 
community,” I said, “and I know that you don't have a lot of Hispanics here,” I said, “because I 
stick out like a sore thumb.”  I said, “So, unfortunately, I'm going to play the race card.”  I said, 
“I'm military, first of all, and I don't know when I'm going to be leaving.”  I said, “I know I'm 
going to be here at least two years,” I said, “but other than that, I can't guarantee anything else.”  
I said, “And secondly,” I said, “I'm Hispanic,” I said, “and you have to have some kind of policy 
that states that you have to have so many minorities in your classes, or in your programs.”  So, 
she just looks at me.  I said, “I hate to do this,” I said, “and I normally wouldn't,” I said, “but I'm 
going to play the race card today.”  And she says, “If you can pass the test, and you can pass the 
entry exams,” she says, “we’ll place you in the next class coming up.”  So, sure enough, about 
three months later, I was let into their LPN program, so. 
 
AG: Could you explain what an LPN is? 
 
MR: It's a Licensed Practical Nurse, yeah.  In Georgia, yeah, it was a Licensed Practical Nurse.  
In Texas, they’re Licensed Vocational Nurses.  So depending on where you go, is the name.  But, 
like, for Georgia and Florida, it's an LPN, so it’s a Licensed Practical Nurse.  Well, you're 
basically just like a regular nurse, except there are certain restrictions and every state has 
different restrictions on what an LPN can do.  When I left Georgia, I had just graduated school 
and my husband retired from there, so we moved to Florida.  So the only licensure I got was here 
in Florida, because I came, here I sat for my test, and I ended up getting my LPN license.  From 
there, I was able to go work in the hospital.  That's where my first job was.  I worked at St.  
Joseph's hospital in Tampa, and I worked in their orthopedics neurological floor, and there were 
certain things we couldn't do.  Even to this day, like, we can't handle central lines unless you go 
through a different course.  So we had to take, like, an additional 40 hour course to handle any 
kind of central lines, and to put in peripheral lines, and things like that, so I had to take - get 
certified in that, but we can't hang blood - in the state of Florida, you can't hang blood.  You can 
be the witness and then monitor the blood, but you can't initially hang it.  [39:58] There's certain 
drugs that you can't push via any kind of line, so, you know, if there any cardiac drugs or if you 
have any pain medications, stuff like that, that's things that, you know, your hands are tied and 
you can't push.  So I did that for about a year in the hospital, and then, from there, I went into a 
long-term care facility and work there for about 9 years before I went back to school.  I think I

14 
would have been okay with just being an LPN, but I got tired of training the RNs to do the job 
that I would do and they were getting paid so much more.  And then, they would leave and I 
would have to step into their shoes and train the next one.  I used to come home and complain all 
the time to my husband, and he had some pretty choice words for me.  The last time he was like, 
you know what, I don't want to hear it anymore, shit or get off the pot.  Go back to school or, you 
know, be done with it.  I remember, I got so mad, the next day I took the credit card out of our 
safe - because we normally didn't use it - I went right down to the local community college, and I 
enrolled at the school and I went back to school.  I went back and I got my associate’s degree, 
and I became an associate’s degree RN through Excelsior College.  Then, I went back online 
through their program and I got my bachelor’s.  Then, I took about a month or so off and went 
back and got my master’s in education.  So I was in school forever. 
 
AG: What made working for the VA appealing to you?  How did you decide to make that 
switch? 
 
MR: That was another not so good story.  I worked all over, and normally because I had the 
opportunity of doing that because I never had to worry about any kind of medical insurance, 
because my husband was retired.  So I was very lucky in that aspect, to where I could try 
different aspects of nursing.  So I went from long-term care to the orthopedic neurological floor.  
Then, from there, I went into medical surgical floor and I did that for quite a while.  Then, I got 
tired of that and I moved over into the mother baby newborn nursery.  Working in there, I 
managed to go back and get trained in labor and delivery.  I wanted to go into L&D, and that was 
the ultimate.  If I had landed in labor and delivery, I would never have moved.  But I was 
working at Brandon Hospital, and I was working in the newborn nursery overnight.  It was a 
Sunday night, and we normally had about anywhere between 20 and 27 babies on an average.  At 
about two o'clock in the morning the nurses would collect all the babies, they would bring them 
in, and they would get weighed and, you know, we would draw any labs, they would check their 
bilirubin test to make sure that they weren't jaundiced.  And then, all of their linen was changed 
and the little carts were restocked to be sent back to mom.  Well, that was also the time when 
they would give their moms a break and let them sleep for a couple of hours before the babies 
were delivered again - were taken back to them.  But they never took into account the fact that 
there was only one of me in the nursery, and the other nurses were constantly in and out.  I 
always told them, I said, “It's not safe when I have more than, you know, 10 babies in here, I 
can't monitor them.”  I said, “When they come in here and I've got 27 kids in here, anything can 
happen and I - by the time I get to that one, you know, he could be dead.”  That was always my 
greatest fear.  Well, that night, I had 25 babies in the nursery, and all of a sudden I heard one of 
them choking and I couldn't determine which one it was.  So, by the time I got to that baby, he 
was blue.  I remember hitting the code button, and I started CPR, and by that time the Nurse 
Practitioner that was down in the NICU came up, and she - the baby turned out to be fine, but he 
needed to go down into the NICU.  But I was so upset about the fact that they had put us into that 
situation, that - I remember, I was sitting there, and I'm yelling at the nurses about the fact that, 
how many times have I asked you that, if you guys are going to leave this many babies in here, I 
need at least one other person to stay here with me?  And, of course, they're like, well, we have 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship  
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans 
 
15 
so many moms and babies, and we're busy, and it was just a no win situation, and management 
just wasn't listening to anyone.  So I remember, I sent all the kids out and they had to take them 
all back out to their moms and dads at that point.  I was sitting at the nurses station and 
somebody had left the newspaper there, and right on top was this big, huge one-page ad about 
how the VA was hiring and they were looking for nurses.  [44:56] So I went home, I called out, 
and I went to the job fair that the VA was having.  I spoke to the ICU - the medical intensive care 
nurse - their nurse manager was there.  I was just talking to her and, you know, telling her about 
my experience, and where I had worked, and where I was currently working.  She says, “We 
have positions over in the spinal cord, we have positions in mental health.”  I said, “No.  If I'm 
going to make the move, I need to go into a specialty.”  I said, “I'm not going back to the floor.”  
She says, “Okay, well, let's - we have this program called the Critical Care Internship Program, 
and we teach our own nurses and then we put them into the units.”  So I went ahead and left my 
application, and about three days later I got called in for an interview.  There was - it was pretty 
competitive, because everybody wants to work for the VA.  There was 43 people that put their 
applications in, and they only hired five of us.  So I was able to go in, and I went through their 
Critical Care Internship Program, and this was in 2007, and the very following - the beginning of 
the following year, I got there in June.  We went through the program and I got done with the 
program, I think it was, like, November, December.  And then, of course, you have to work with 
someone for a while.  So it took me about a year to get through the program completely, to be 
able to work on my own, I've been there ever since.  Yeah, I worked there for almost 13 years 
because I left last year, so yeah. 
 
AG: What is it like to work in the ICU, the Intensive Care Unit? 
 
MR: When you work in the Intensive Care Unit, you work with a lot of people who are 
extremely ill.  They're just - they're either septic to where they don't have a blood pressure, or 
their blood pressures are very low, or maybe they're not breathing appropriately so they're on 
ventilators.  That’s the ICU I worked in, because I worked in the medical part of it.  So we dealt 
a lot with sepsis, which is when someone has such a bad infection throughout their whole body 
that their kidneys start to shut down, their liver starts to shut down, they’re on a ventilator 
because they're not able to breathe and/or protect their airway.  Then, we have patients who come 
in because they - a lot of our veterans have been longtime smokers since they were, like, 14, 15 
years old, so they have a lot of lung issues and they have to be put on special equipment to force 
air into their lungs.  So, you know, that can't be handled on the floor because they have to be 
monitored so closely.  Then, we have others who might have had a severe stroke and we're trying 
to bring them back from that.  All of our code blue patients, patients that have gone into cardiac 
arrest in the hospital, always came to us, so we had to deal with all of that.  These are the people 
who - we can only handle two patients at a time, simply because of the fact that they are just so 
ill, and we have to work with drugs that normally would never be given on the floor and that can 
only be given through what we call a central line, which is a big line that we put either in their 
neck or in their groin, that we can give medication that can be caustic to regular veins in their in 
their arms, and it's got a larger - it's a larger bore, which means it's got a bigger hole.  It makes a 
bigger hole in a larger hose, basically, I guess people can understand it that way, to where we can 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship  
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans 
 
16 
push medications in and keep them alive.  So yeah, it's very - not only labor intensive, but you 
also always have to be thinking ahead and trying to balance, because, maybe if you give him too 
much of this medication, his kidneys aren't going to react as well.  Or, if you give him too much 
fluid, it might be good for the kidneys but it's not good for the heart.  So, you're always trying to 
play a balancing act with medications and fluids to keep that patient alive and healthy. 
 
AG: How many hours did you work? 
 
MR: We would get there at 7:30 at night and work until eight o'clock in the morning, but if you 
had a very critical patient, sometimes it got to be 8:00, 8:30, nine o'clock in the morning before 
you could finish off your charting and making sure that the handoff to the next nurse was fine.  
Or maybe this patient decided he was going to crash right before change of shift, so you're trying 
to deal with all of that and trying to get the other nurse updated on what's going on.  So, it's 
supposed to be 12 hour shifts, three days a week, but sometimes it could turn into a 13, 14 hour 
day depending on how ill your patient was. 
 
[50:07] AG: Do you always work overnights? 
 
MR: I did.  My husband is a night worker, so once the boys were gone - because we had always 
worked opposite shifts because we were trying to raise a family.  But once the boys graduated 
high school and they were out doing their own thing, then I went back to overnights because it 
was difficult for him to go to days.  So, we ended up working overnights together and for the 
last, I’d say, 20 years, I've been working overnights. 
 
AG: Are overnight shifts more difficult, you know, from your perspective, for nurses? 
 
MR: Oh, absolutely.  First of all, you don't have all the other ancillary services that are there to 
help you.  So you have to be much more autonomous and you have to be much more - I'm not 
going to say aggressive, but assertive in the things that you do and how you care for your patient, 
because where we might have the physicians that - you know, you might have the 
anesthesiologist, and the pulmonologist, and everyone right there, now we have a resident who's 
in house, who - sure, they might have that physicians experience, but we've got 10 years of ICU 
on them, so we're helping guide them and they’re there to help us - like, we tell them what orders 
we want or what medication we would need.  So, we're - it's a collaborative team with the 
resident that you have on duty.  So, you do, you have to be much more assertive and be much 
more aware of what's going on with that patient, because you don't have everyone else to come 
in and help if you get into a bind and you have to really depend on the other nurses that you work 
with.  The nights can be - a lot of times, your patients will get worse at night, just like when a kid 
gets sick and they end up running - spiking that fever, or - everything seems to get worse at 
night.  So we always had to be a little more vigilant in that aspect, to make sure that our patients 
were okay.  You had to be attuned to just even the smallest change in, maybe, a heart rate or a 
blood pressure because if you could catch it early, you weren't going to have that crash and burn 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship  
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans 
 
17 
three hours later, so you could try to correct it early on in the shift.  But those were some of the 
things that I really noticed when I was working in the ICU at that time. 
 
AG: What do you think makes working for the VA appealing to nurses? 
 
MR: I think what made it appealing to me is the fact that I had already done a lot of different 
types of nursing other than pediatric nursing, because I just - kids, just too much on the heart, I 
can't do kids.  But I think the fact that I was a veteran myself and the fact that I was looking for a 
place that I could retire from, that I could call home and retire, and I could relate to the vets.  
When they come in and they're talking about, you know, where they've been, and what they've 
done, and they start talking the military lingo that a lot of nurses kind of just, like, brush off, I 
could actually hold a conversation, and build that rapport, and build that trust, and I think that 
was a big thing for me, was that I could give back to those that I had served with.  And I was 
looking for a place to just call home, and to finish off my nursing career, and that's why I went 
ahead and I took the opportunity to go and work at the VA. 
 
AG: Do you think that, as a veteran, you're better able to relate to your patients, connect with 
them, and build rapport? 
 
[54:17] MR: Oh, absolutely.  Absolutely.  I find myself being more - to be more engaged with 
veterans.  Whenever I wear my badge, my little lanyard has U.S.  Air Force Veteran on it, so 
when they see that, they automatically start talking to me about their experiences and, well, were 
you here, or where were you stationed?  Or they'll make a joke, oh, you were in the Chair Force, 
you know, because they feel that they’re the - we're, like, the elite, so we always got the good 
stuff.  So they would always call us names, oh, you guys don't even work, you're not even part of 
the military.  I always tease back when they say, “Oh, you're part of the Chair Force,” I said, 
“Yes.  Smarter, not harder.”  So, you know, it's like this rapport that we automatically have, and 
you have a lot of veterans that don't want what they call a regular nurse taking care of them, or 
they would rather - they’ll come in and they’ll say, “Don't you have a veteran in here?” So, you 
know, they want someone that they feel can relate to what they're going through or what they've 
been through.  In that aspect, I think it's made me a better person, a better nurse, a better person, 
because I'm able to step out of - sometimes step out of the nursing role and be more into the 
veteran role, to where we can - I can help them have more confidence in the people who are 
caring for them.  Because, a lot of times, the doctors are very young, they don't have any military 
experience, which they have an issue with.  If they can trust me, then I can help them build some 
kind of relationship or trust with the physician that's going to be caring for them.  So - and I think 
that that helps out a lot. 
 
AG: What do you think the most challenging aspect of your job is? 
 
MR: The most challenging aspect is - hmm, I’m not exactly sure.  I think a lot of it - you know, I 
love working with the VA and there's nothing - no place else, at this point in my career, that I 
would work, but we are so wasteful.  Because I've worked both - I've worked in the community 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship  
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans 
 
18 
and I’ve worked at the VA.  As good of care as we give our veterans, and we don't spare any cost 
in any of the treatments that they need.  If they have to have a procedure done, we take really 
good care of our vets, but in that same aspect, we waste a lot of supplies.  We waste - there's just 
a lot of waste, to where, if we could just curb that and just try to find different ways of keeping 
the waste down while we still provide that excellent care, I think we would be okay.  I think 
that's the only negative that I see in working with the VA, because I've had wonderful managers 
and I would never have gotten to the level of education that I am in - that I received - had I not 
had that push from the managers that that I had, because they were always very encouraging.  If I 
needed time off to study, if I had papers that I needed to have written, they were always very 
accommodating, so I can't say anything negative in that aspect.  The only thing that I feel is, if 
we could just find a way to curb the waste.  Yeah. 
 
AG: What do you think the most rewarding part of working for the VA is? 
 
MR: The most rewarding part, for me, is when I take care of a 96, 97 year old World War II vet 
who is sitting there telling me about his experiences, you know, with all these people that you 
just read about in the history books, Eisenhower, and they talk to you about - one was in - he was 
in Hawaii when Pearl Harbor got bombed, and he was only 16 years old.  He was he 16, had just 
turned 17, and his mom and dad had signed for him to go into the military.  He said that he was 
there, and he was a cook.  He said that he was in one of the buildings, so he wasn't on the actual 
ships, which - but he says, “I remember.  I was there when all that happened.”  And the stories 
that they tell, you know, and even when I've been giving vaccines and these World War II vets 
came in there, and they talk to you about how he had never voted for anyone before until he 
voted for his Commander-in-Chief - or his Commander, who ended up becoming his 
Commander-in-Chief.  So yeah, that's the rewarding for me, is to speak to those that have gone 
before me and basically - and the one other one, she was a Chief Master Sergeant, female, in the 
Air Force, which, when I was in, was unheard of, back in the early 80s, she's retired now.  She 
came through there, and I said, “You know what?” I said, “You were the type of female that I 
looked up to when I was in the military,” I said, “because I know what it took just to make rank,” 
I said, “and for you to make the highest rank that the Air Force had to offer, as an enlisted,” I 
said, “hats off to you.”  I said, “You are, you know, my hero, honestly.” 
 
[1:00:16] AG: You have also deployed as a volunteer with RNRN. 
 
MR: I have.  I've gone several different places with RNRN.  Puerto Rico, actually.  I was at work 
when Hurricane Maria went through Puerto Rico, and I knew that my husband had family in 
Puerto Rico that we hadn't been able to reach.  And then, I had signed up for RNRN about two 
years previously and they had never tagged me for deployment.  So, when this one came 
through, I really wanted to go.  So I contacted our local Union Leader, and he says, “I don't know 
of anyone, but I do know this one lady.  Let me put you through to Rhonda Riser.”  So, I 
contacted Rhonda and I said, “Listen, this is who I am.  I went ahead and I've put my name in for 
RNRN, no one's ever contacted me.  Is there any way that you can put me in contact with 
someone that I can speak, to see about this deployment that I know they're getting ready to go 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship  
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans 
 
19 
on, and I would like to join them?” So, she gave me Alice Grubb’s number.  I remember, I called 
Alice, and I said, “Listen, you don't know me from Adam.  This is who I am.  I speak both 
languages.  I work in the ICU.  I'm a veteran.  I would love nothing more than to join you and 
your group when you go to Puerto Rico.”  I said, “I am a union member.  I've been a union 
member since I started here at the VA, back in 2007.”  She says, “Okay.  Let me get back with 
you.  Can you get the time off?” So I went back to my job and I talked to my supervisor, and 
between her and the union steward and the Union Leader, we managed to get people to cover my 
shifts and get the vacation time to where I could be gone for those two weeks.  That's when Alice 
got back with me, and Alice got back with me, like, on a Tuesday, and by Thursday morning I 
was in New York getting ready to deploy to California.  So, it was just that quick.  But yes, we 
did go to Puerto Rico which was tragic in itself, and the way that we responded, but that opened 
up a lot of doors for me with the union and RNRN. 
 
AG: Were you staying in San Juan? 
 
MR: Our hub - our base was in San Juan.  And then, from there, on a daily basis, a lot of us 
would go out into different areas of the island, depending on how far we could go, if we had 
transportation, and things like that.  So our group started out in San Juan and then, from there, we 
would go out with the other union members.  Like, there was guys there from New York who 
were, like, plumbers and electricians and stuff.  So they would take us under their wing, and they 
were already helping rebuild homes out in different areas.  So we would go out with them, and 
then we would go to wherever they had their city hub, where they were directing things from that 
one area.  We would go and talk to their mayor or we would talk to the city leaders, and they 
would tell us, well, this is where we need you, or we have this high rise with a lot of elderly that 
we haven't had a check on, or we had an outbreak of pink eye in this shelter, can you go out and 
help there?  That's how we ended up going into a lot of these different places.  I’ll never forget, 
we were on our way up this mountain and we were in a van, and there was eight of us going up 
in this van, and we had our driver.  You would look over, and the road had been washed away.  
We had just enough room for that van to get up that side of the mountain, but we had to go up 
there.  We were delivering water, we were delivering MREs, and we had a lot of medical 
supplies that we had brought with us from States, that we had packed and brought with us, and - 
because there was an elderly senior citizen center, community center, at the very top of this 
mountain that no one had had a chance to check on.  So we took them water, we took them food, 
we dressed a lot of wounds, and we gave them equipment.  Like, I had an extra blood pressure 
cuff, an extra stethoscope, we had an extra glucometer.  So, there was a nurse that had her office 
out of there, and we gave her anything extra that we might have had.  And then, even after we 
came back to the States, I went back to some of my coworkers and we collected well over - it 
was almost $250.00 worth of supplies, and I mailed them to her so that she could have it there 
for her community and the community center.  So, it's been years and I still keep in contact with 
her over Facebook, so yeah. 
 
[1:05:18] AG: How many nurses and volunteers traveled to Puerto Rico following the hurricane? 
 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship  
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans 
 
20 
MR: There was 300 of us from various unions from all over the United states.  United Airlines 
flew us over there.  Their stewardesses and their pilots - of course, they have a very strong union, 
so they supplied the transportation to and from.  And then, we had, of course, the Teamsters, and 
then we had our nursing union, and we had - the New York Nursing Union sent nurses, and we 
had, like I said, plumbers, electricians.  Some of these guys had even responded to 911, and they 
were with us in Puerto Rico.  So we had a wide array of different laborers that were there, 
helping the people of Puerto Rico. 
 
AG: What kinds of health issues and conditions did you see, and did you treat when you were 
there? 
 
MR: It all depended on where you went, but the things that we did see the most were the fact that 
people didn't have their medications.  So we had a lot of hypertensive crises where their blood 
pressures were very, very high.  We had a lot of people who thought that their insulin needed to 
be refrigerated, so there was no refrigeration and, of course, ice was very hard to come by, so we 
had a lot of people whose blood glucose was out of control.  We had people who were stepping 
on objects and ended up with wounds and infections in their feet, or in their hands.  We had that 
huge pink eye outbreak in the shelter, and we had to bring in an ophthalmologist and, you know, 
different - some of us were already versed on how to deal with and give medications in their eyes 
and stuff like that.  And all the nurse - and one thing I have to say with RNRN, all the nurses that 
went were specialty nurses.  We had ICU nurses, we had ER nurses, we had high-risk OB nurses.  
So, every nurse came from a specialty.  So it wasn't, like, your run of the mill middle nurse that 
can work on the floor, but a lot of us had that extra knowledge that we could impart if we had to 
work autonomously, so - and that was one thing.  So, when we were out in the field working, 
sure, we might have a doctor or a nurse practitioner with us, but all she had to do was tell us 
what to do and we already knew - or we were, like, one step ahead and say, “Hey, can we,” - and 
she didn't have to spend her time guiding us on what needed to be done.  All she had to do was, 
like, bark out orders and we could do it.  So it was very rewarding in that aspect but we did see a 
lot of heat stroke, people waiting in lines trying to get to FEMA so that they could fill out 
paperwork.  So we saw a lot of heat stroke, we saw quite a bit of dehydration.  We also saw a lot 
of food poisoning, because they would - it's not so much food poisoning, but water.  They had 
dirty water that they were drinking, so they ended up with a lot of abdominal issues, a lot of 
diarrhea, mold.  People were having lung issues because the mold was rampant in a lot of their 
homes.  So, depending on where you went and what community you were dealing with, it was 
totally different everywhere we would go. 
 
AG: And you've done other deployments with RNRN as well, right? 
 
[1:09:14] MR: We did follow up in Puerto Rico that following February.  So, I went back again 
in February and we were down in - we had gone from San Juan that first time.  And then, when I 
went back again, we were down in Ponce, we worked with the local community there.  What 
they have is almost like this - almost like this real big community center that does a lot of 
medical research, and they also work with the community as far as their pregnant women and 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship  
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans 
 
21 
anyone who has any chronic conditions.  They go out, and they know where they are, so they - 
not only do they see them there in the clinic, but they know to send somebody out if that 
particular person hasn't come in, so that's how they keep track of them.  We would do a lot of 
their home visits while I was there, and making sure that they had what they needed, and making 
sure that - if they needed medication, if they needed a ride in to see a doctor, how was this 
pregnant -this newly delivered mom with her baby, how are they faring?  You know, we went 
out and we weighed the baby, made sure that they had everything that they needed.  And then, 
they also had these huge buses that, on one of the weekends that I was there, we took up into the 
mountainside and it was, like, a community - it was a community bus that they could come in 
and get vaccinations, if somebody needed medication, if somebody needed to be seen by the 
doctor and they can't make their way down, we went to them.  So we got to do a lot of that while 
I was there also, the second time around. 
 
AG: How long was that second deployment? 
 
MR: The second deployment was only eight days.  But what we did notice when we first got 
there is, they still didn't have power.  A lot of these places we went to - and, here, Maria had 
gone through early October, and here it is February, and some of these places still didn't have 
power. 
 
AG: Did you also deploy to Guatemala with RNRN?  The Registered Nurse Response Network? 
 
MR: Yes, I did.  I went to Guatemala - actually, I deployed with RNRN twice to Guatemala.  
When we were there, we set up clinics.  They work in collaboration with an individual who has - 
his dad died over there and he was a union - a labor leader, and his dad died trying to make 
things better for the people.  And just, one day, he went to work and he never came home, so 
yeah, so we work in collaboration with him.  Gosh, I wish I could remember his name.  I went 
with them twice.  The first time, we went up to a community where we held clinics and we saw 
well over - I think it was well over 4,000 people in three days.  We take our own doctors - well, 
we take nurse practitioners, but we were also working in collaboration with the Cuban Doctor’s 
Brigade that's up there.  So, they're there, and then we bring in nurses, and then there's local 
nurses that work with us.  The last deployment, we had dentists that were with us, it was a group 
of dentists, there was four of them that had just completed their internship and they were - just 
gotten their license to become dentists, and they were there working with them all - working with 
us all.  So, we had dentists, we had nurse practitioners who did OB, and then - and they did pap 
smears and well women checks.  And then, we had two pediatricians, and then the rest were 
practitioners, and we were just seeing streams of people, any medical condition.  The 
Guatemalan deployments were only for seven days, because we would - the day of travel, and 
then we did the staging, got all of our medications and everything ready, and then we worked for 
three days, and then we had a day of - where they took us around and showed us their 
community and had, like, this little festival for us, and then the day we came home.  So yeah, it 
was only seven days. 
 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship

22 
AG: What year did you do these deployments? 
 
MR: Yeah.  I think it was 2018.  It was the following year - so, in 2019, and then - oh, I don't 
know, because I went - it had to have been in ’17, because then I went ’18 and ’19 to Guatemala, 
because we didn't go anywhere last year.  So it had to have been 2017 for Maria, 2018 for my 
first trip to Guatemala, and then 2019 for the second one.  And in the meantime, in between that, 
I also went in Tucson.  I went to - I worked with Catholic Services and RNRN at the border with 
all of the immigration, all those people that - the migratory, you know, that issue that we were 
having with all the people from Guatemala, El Salvador, Mexico, and stuff like that.  So I did 
two - I went there twice with that.  Mm-hmm. 
 
AG: Oh, wow.  What were some of the medical issues that you saw there? 
 
[1:14:59] MR: With the ones in Tucson, we saw a lot of, again, gastric type of issues, because 
they were not fed appropriately when they were in custody.  They were given these burritos that 
they would throw on a counter and let them defrost during the day, and then that was their 
dinner.  In the morning, they would give them, like, a cereal bar and one of the little juicy juices 
for the kids, and the parents got a cereal bar and a bottle of water, and that was breakfast.  And 
then, for lunch, they would give them, maybe, again, the same thing, juicy juice, some water, and 
they might get another energy bar or something.  And then, for dinner, they would give the 
burrito that had been sitting out on the counter all day long.  So, by the time they got to us, the 
first meals - we would never give them anything solid to eat when they first get to us, because we 
didn't know how their stomachs were going to react.  So we would give them soup upon arrival, 
and we always had, like, oranges and watermelon, and stuff like that that was going to be easy on 
the intestinal tract until we could get them to where they could eat that.  We’d make sure that 
they were okay, and then we would give them a solid meal, you know, later on that evening.  But 
a lot of them had issues, as far as gastrointestinal issues.  We had one lady that - they had her 
there, and she was in labor, and she had been in labor for a day and a half, and it wasn't until they 
finally decided that they were going - that she was about to deliver, or she might deliver on them, 
that they went and just took her over to the shelter.  They didn't even take her to the hospital, 
they took her over to the shelter.  We had to take her to the hospital, and she ended up delivering 
there.  So yeah, it was a lot of really heartbreaking - we saw a lot of heartbreaking things in the 
shelter, yeah. 
 
AG: Do you know how RNRN ended up deploying there? 
 
MR: Yes.  Yes.  What happened was, RNRN was trying to find a place that they could partner 
with on the border in order to try to help with this crisis.  They met up with Catholic Services in 
Tucson, and they found that they had a really good shelter situation there, the people who were 
running it were doing a really good job, and that it was safe for us to be able to go into, those 
were the three things.  So, when the scouting team went out first and they found that that would 
be a good place for us to be able to assist, then the rest of us started coming in.  And when we 
were there, we basically went in on a Thursday evening and we left on a Sunday night, or early 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship  
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans 
 
23 
Monday morning, because we were giving the regular staff a break over the weekend so that that 
way they could go home, see to their families, their medical staff could take a little bit of a break, 
and we would come in and we stayed there.  We stayed in the shelter, we made sure that if 
anybody needed anything in the middle of the night, that there was always someone there. 
 
AG: Were people typically there for a long time when you saw them, or what was, like, the 
duration of the confinement? 
 
MR: It varied.  There was some that might have been there overnight and they were being 
released, and yet there was some that had been there, you know, 6, 8 weeks, and were finally 
getting released.  We did have some issues where - the only reason that Catholic Services got 
involved was because what ICE was doing was - the people who were being released, they were 
just taking them and dumping at the bus station.  They didn't have any money, they didn't have 
any way of contacting family, they didn't have a place to stay, but - and this is what they were 
doing.  That was their way of releasing them into, you know, the U.S.  So what Catholic Services 
did was, they went in and they said, “Don't drop them off there, bring them to us and we'll take 
care of them from here.”  And they had the best medical staff working there, and then all of their 
volunteers.  They had so many volunteers.  The ladies who manned the kitchen, who managed to 
get food from the different grocery stores, local grocery stores, and that's how they managed to 
get a lot of their food to feed them.  [1:19:51] We had a room full of supplies to where, if we 
knew who was going to be leaving what day, they went in there and they got them a shopping 
bag or, you know, one of those little reusable bags that the stores would give them, they would 
pack enough food and water for however many days they were going to be on the bus, they had a 
blanket with them, they had - we had a room that people were donating clothes that we would - 
the ladies there would wash - hang up all the clothes, and everything was set up in sizes - and the 
families could go in there and shop for whatever they wanted, so that way they had clothes, 
depending on where they were going.  Some might be going up north where it was getting to be - 
going to be cold, so they needed cold weather gear.  Now, they're coming from Honduras and 
Nicaragua, everything’s - it's always warm, so they have no cold weather clothes.  So we made 
sure that they had something to eat, that they had clothing, that they had a bed that they could 
sleep in, and food.  Food was always a big thing, and food security - if they needed something in 
the middle of the night, they were hungry, we would go into the kitchen and get something for 
them.  We always made them feel like there was nothing that they couldn't ask for, within 
reason, that they couldn't have.  And we had a room that was set up with all volunteers, again, 
that would contact their family members, because a lot of them had numbers.  So we would 
contact their family members, and they would speak to them, and then those families would 
make arrangements, whether it be by bus, or some of them were nearby to where they would 
drive and pick them up, but at least they were given the opportunity of having some place safe to 
stay until the families could make arrangements to have them come live with them. 
 
AG: Did these deployments affect you, you know, sort of emotionally, psychologically?  Were 
they hard on you? 
 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship  
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans 
 
24 
MR: Yes, it did.  Especially when we were in Puerto Rico, because Puerto Rico, as you know, 
they only speak Spanish.  Sure, they understand English, but most of their - everything that's 
done on a daily basis is in Spanish, and you have a lot of your elderly there that don't speak 
English.  I think that's the one that I found the most heartbreaking, because they were telling you 
everything that they had just gone through, and everything that they had lost, and you can 
translate that - you can translate that to someone but the anguish and the pain, you can't.  That, 
you absorb, because there's no way that you can convey that to the person in a translation.  So 
that, I thought - I felt was the hardest for me, was when I was in Puerto Rico, simply because you 
could feel their sense of loss, their sense of anguish, and that was the most difficult thing for me.  
When you’re in Guatemala, you're translating, but you're translating what they're complaining 
about, their medical issues they’re complaining about.  They're not going into, you know, what's 
happening at home or their life, what they just - what just occurred to them.  So that, to me, was 
a lot easier because it was strictly medical and, sure, you would joke with them, and then you got 
to hold their babies while they did all that, but that was more of a helpful - and I know I'm 
getting something done, and I'm helping someone.  And then, when you go to Tucson and you 
hear the horror - the horror stories from those families, and even though you're not translating it 
to anyone because all they want to do is to speak and to get off their chest, you're still sitting 
there and you're absorbing all of the ugliness.  And a lot of that ugliness, unfortunately, we had 
something to do with, because whether it's refusing to give money so that they can try to improve 
the situation in those countries, or helping those countries put leaders in place that are doing 
nothing but lining their own pockets and not looking out for their people, in some way, form, or 
fashion, we have helped that - we've helped that migration get to the point that it is now.  And to 
have to listen to some of the things that they had to endure - we had a pregnant mom that - her 
husband dug a hole under the fence so that she could get underneath the fence and come over to 
the U.S., and she was nine months pregnant.  She left the hospital in labor because they were 
being tracked down by the gangs, and they were going to kill them.  They went into the hospital, 
shot up the hospital, looking for them, okay?  [1:24:50] And, you know, you have another mom 
who, her 14 year old daughter was going to school, and - beautiful little girl, she showed me her 
picture, and one of the gang members decided that he liked her and he wanted her for his 
girlfriend.  She politely declined and he told her that it didn't matter, that she was going to be his 
girlfriend.  When she kept refusing and refusing, two days later, mom went to go pick her up, 
they were walking home from school, and they came and shot her, put 15 gunshot wounds right 
there in front of her mom, and told her mother that if she didn't leave, that that little 4 year old 
that she had in her - right next to her was going to be next.  So, she had to flee also.  Those are 
the things that you had to sit there and listen to, and being bilingual, you have - I didn't say you 
have to, I said, but I felt like it was part of my nursing, because only a nurse - you nurse the 
whole body, and a lot of that is mental also.  And if all they need is someone to talk to, you have 
to be able to hold that hand, and to listen, and let them cry, or cry with them, you know? 
 
AG: Do you think that you drew on your experiences, you know, in the military, in the Armed 
Services, during your deployments? 
 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship  
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans 
 
25 
MR: I never thought about that, because I think I always just wore my nursing hat.  But, you 
know, maybe.  Maybe I did pull from some of that in the past, but I do know that I think nursing 
provided more of the backbone of what I did.  I think I pulled more from that than I did from 
anything else. 
 
AG: With all of this varied experience, how do you think of your role in caring for patients? 
 
MR: I am such - I am one of the biggest nurse advocates you'll ever find.  My patients always, 
always come first, regardless of how small, or how large, or what we need to do for them.  I feel 
that that is one of the biggest hats that we wear, is being an advocate for our patient, simply 
because of the fact that we know the medical field.  We know the medications, we know what it's 
supposed to be like, and they don't.  We have to be able to educate, and we have to be able to 
say, no, I don't think that's the proper treatment for him, why are you going to go that route, or 
can you explain to me why?  Because a lot of the elderly will automatically just say, okay, well, 
that's what the doctor said.  No.  Just because the doctor said, does not mean that it's right.  Can 
you explain to me why we're going to do this?  And I've caught a lot of backlash from some 
physicians because they don't like to be questioned, but I work in a very nurse-friendly 
atmosphere at the VA, to where, if someone - they're not allowed to speak to you in any kind of 
way.  I respect you just like you respect me, and yelling and bullying and all of that is not 
tolerated.  So we're much more apt to advocate for our patients and get the results that they need 
versus what the doctor thinks is good for them.  And as far as patient advocacy, a nurse is almost 
like the last stop gap before something bad can happen to that patient, or if that patient really 
doesn't want to do something but, yet, the doctors kind of - I’m not going to say forcing, but 
being a little overbearing about it, then I think it's up to us to step in and say, you know what, I 
really don't think that that's what they want.  Why don't we try something different?  Or maybe, 
you know, if we explain it to him in another manner, maybe he would agree with you at that 
point.  But I think advocacy is one of the biggest roles that we play for our patients. 
 
AG: How have you seen nursing change over the course of your career? 
 
MR: So many things.  We used to do paper charting, all of our labs were - you’d write it all out 
and send it - fax it down to the lab, and somebody would come up, and draw your blood, and do 
whatever.  Now, everything’s done electronically.  We've gone from worrying about, can I 
decipher this doctor’s handwriting to having all of your orders pop right up on your computer 
screen as you're taking care of your patient.  So, in that aspect, it cuts down on errors, it cuts 
down on timeliness because now the order comes right through and we can see it immediately as 
to where, before, you had to go to the desk, try to decipher it, sign it off.  [1:30:01] So in that 
aspect, that's changed in nursing - we're seeing a lot of older nurses leaving the profession 
because of it, though, and we're losing a lot of experience.  So, as to where it's a good thing 
because it's much more convenient, and you can put your fingers on what happened two days ago 
much easier than you could before, or a nurse has a tendency to chart a lot faster and include so 
much more because of the fact that it's on the computer versus having to sit there and take the 
time to scribble it all in - but there's just some nurses that don't want to make that change or are

having a hard time making that change, that they would rather leave the profession than to stay 
and learn.  So that's one of the main things that I've noticed.  Another big thing, and we're seeing 
this more out in the community than we are within the VA, the way that reimbursement is 
happening now for patients and hospitals.  The insurance companies are playing such an intricate 
part on reimbursement, that if the patient's not happy about the food that they're eating, or if you 
didn't get to him fast enough with a blanket, or - they use patient satisfaction as a marker for 
reimbursement.  So the nurse not only has to worry about taking care of the patient, and what's 
wrong with him, and everything else, but now we have to play nurse maid, and hotel porter, and 
everything else, making sure that they have the food as soon as they ring for it.  And if the family 
wants something, you have to jump through hoops to get it.  If they're not happy, then it reflects 
poorly on you and it reflects poorly on the hospital, because now the hospital won't get 
reimbursed the way that they should.  So that, I think, is taken from the nurses and it's making 
nurses very - again, that they want to leave the profession because of it.  It's like, I did not 
become a nurse to be somebody's maid or somebody's waiter, especially when I have five or six 
patients and this one keeps ringing for something all the time because they want something to 
eat, they want something to drink, and I've got another patient down here that might be on his 
way to the ICU but I can't work with him because I'm constantly having to satisfy this one’s 
needs.  They're not even really medical needs, they’re - you know, they're ready to go home and 
they just want something to eat and drink.  And, unfortunately, that reflects negatively on the 
nurse, and on the unit, and on the hospital if that patient complaints.  So patient satisfaction, I 
think, is playing too big of a role in nursing now. 
 
AG: Absolutely, that makes sense.  And, you know, usually I ask people if there are any lessons 
that they are taking forward from the COVID-19 pandemic.  But I wonder, also, in your case, is 
there any lesson that you're taking forward either from COVID, or from your experiences in 
Puerto Rico, and Guatemala, and Arizona that have, like, stuck with you that you're taking 
forward in your career? 
 
MR: I think being more empathetic and being more aware of people’s needs outside of my realm 
of hospital nursing.  It makes me more aware of what's going on, not only in my community and 
in the U.S.  but also around the world.  I think at being put in those situations, where we watched 
people try - and their resilience after hurricane Maria, and then the resilience of these women 
coming across - traveling miles and miles on foot, or on the top of a train to get to a border of a 
country that they feel is going to give them so much more than what they just left.  And one of 
them told me one day, she says, “The worst day here in the United states isn't even close to being 
the best day I ever had in my own country.”  So that sense of awareness, and that sense of 
helping others, and understanding what others are going through, if I can just pass that on to the 
next generation of the nurses coming up or of, just, people in general who feel - who’ve never 
seen anything but their own communities, or maybe the state, and have never stepped outside 
that comfort zone, if I can just impart a little bit of that knowledge that I have, and a little bit of 
that empathy, and try to get them to be a little empathetic, I think that I would have done my part 
in nursing.

[95:29] AG: Absolutely.  That's so well said.  Maria, is there anything that you want to add 
before we conclude? 
 
MR: No.  I think we covered everything. 
 
AG: Yeah.  This has been wonderful.  Thank you so much for your time.  I’m so happy you’re - 
 
MR: You’re welcome. 
 
AG: - (inaudible - 01:35:46) 
 
MR: I just feel so honored for you to have even asked me to do this, so thank you.
