California Bank Robbers Air-"Jordan is a Hard Road to Travel" The California people are determined
if they find Another such a band of robbers As the banking firm of Adams, from beginning to the
end, They will hang them as they have a lot of rowdies. Chorus: So be careful all you rowdies and
you rich banker thieves, Or the California people will hang you; So be careful all you rowdies and you
rich banker thieves, Or the California people will hang you, I believe. They agreed among themselves
they could easy make a pile, By stealing all they had on deposit; They would do it by a failure, and
be honest all the while [md] Then a million and a half [md] what of it? Chorus. [md] So be careful
ail you rowdies, &c. The Merchant rushed in looking whiter than a sheet, The Miner came tearing
like a bull dog; Poor old washerwomen crying in the street, And Johnny Bull croaking like a bull frog.
Chorus. [md] So be careful all you rowdies, &c. Women carried round on the shoulders of the crowd,
Really was a sight very funny; Legs all bare, though they didn't seem to care, They were bound to
have a sight for their money. Chorus. [md] So be careful all you rowdies, &c. The blind man said to
the bankers, "I'm poor [md] Surely, man, you don't intend to rob me!" The Chinaman said as they
kicked him out the door, "Me no shabee, John, me no shabee!" Chorus. [md] So be careful all you
rowdies, &c.
