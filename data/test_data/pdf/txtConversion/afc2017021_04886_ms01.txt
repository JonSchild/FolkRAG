Introduction. Robert (Bob) Strauss, formerly of the University of Minnesota bindery and 
the Performance Standards for Library Binding group, Library Binding Institute. 
Interviewed June 3, 2017, at the Roslyn Hotel, Roslyn, New York. Interviewed by 
Whitney Pape, librarian.

Career: 1978-9 hired by the University of Minnesota as head of their bindery, and acted 
as a liaison between their library and the bindery, which reported to Printing and Graphic 
Arts.  Bob was hired to improve quality and turn-around time.  Bob introduced 
automation to the bindery, with a stamping machine.  Became interested in preservation 
issues relating to library binding (oversewing, cleat sewing), learning from preservation 
leaders at the Newberry Library in Chicago and British and Irish conservation leaders. 
  
  
00:09:48 
Mentors: Hans Wiesendanger at the University of California, Berkeley took Bob under 
his wing.  Bob previously mentioned Andrea Hinding, Les Metz, Dick Smith, Paul 
Banks, Gary Frost, Merrily Smith, Barclay Ogden, John Dean, Christopher Clarkson, 
Tony Keynes, and Nicholas Pickwoad. 
  
  
00:10:46 
Interesting Projects: Bob refused to bind brittle books, which was standard practice at 
that time.  Instead, he photocopied the book, bound it, and presented to the librarians, 
who loved it, developing preservation photocopying for the University of Minnesota in 
roughly 1980-1. 
  
  
00:15:13  
Regrets: No regrets in his work at the University of Minnesota bindery.  It was a terrific 
launching pad.  Experimented with limp paper bindings and became involved with doing 
work for special collections at U of M. 
  
  
00:22:03 
Interesting Projects:  Bob had started a consulting business, the Preservation 
Management Institute, working with Barclay Ogden (on a part-time basis) and Janet 
Bridgland.  Barclay was working on the NISO Library Binding Standard Committee to 
revise the Library Binding Standard, and the committee wanted a consultant to help 
change from a cookbook-style standard to a performance standard, things like adhesive 
stretch and abrasion-resistance of book cloth.  They developed standard sample books for 
testing and proposing what qualified as acceptable performance.  Barclay and Bob also 
received a grant from the Kress Foundation to investigate German bookbinding materials 
and processes, leading to a publication for LBI, "Polyvinyl Acetate Adhesives for 
Double-Fan Adhesive Binding:  Report on a Review and Specification Study." 
  
  
00:37:32 
Strauss discuses Rounding and Backing vs. Flatback Binding.  Flatback books met all the 
performance specifications.  Bob requested sample books from ICI (Information 
Conservation, Inc.) in both the rounded and backed and the flatback style, and also 
requested both styles of binding from Campbell-Logan Bindery in Minneapolis, then 
tested them for performance.  The rounded and backed book from ICI was the higher 
performer for rounded and backed books and the flatback sample from Campbell-Logan 
was the higher performing flatback book.  All of them met the standard. 
  
  
00:41:10 
Greatest Accomplishment: Although he was not necessarily welcomed with open arms 
at LBI when he represented a university bindery which was competing with the 
commercial binders, Bob is celebrating with those "competitors" who are now friends 
forty years later.  Also pleased that his sample bindings that were unearthed at the 
University of Minnesota when they closed down the bindery in 2015 were still something 
in which he could take pride thirty-five years later. 
 
 
00:43:50 
Mentors: Bob mentioned once again that Les Metz was the best person he ever worked 
for.  Bob took great satisfaction in working with Fritz James and other binders to 
innovate library binding.  His father was also a good model of a strong work ethic.
