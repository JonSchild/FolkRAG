Introduction 
00:00:32-00:09:13 
Went to college in late 60s/early 70s during political turmoil, people 
protesting Vietnam War. Went to Tufts University outside of Boston, went 
to political demonstrations but felt powerless. Caught bug of wanting to go 
back to the land, was studying American history, started focusing on how 
early colonists fed themselves. Then interested in history of agriculture, 
made own major, got job working on farm at Old Sturbridge Village. Met 
other people same age with similar interests, where he met Anne. Were also 
a lot of retired farmers working there part-time, good fellowship between 
older and young people, sharing stories. Graduated college, moved to VT 
within a few days, started working on dairy farm in Barnet, VT on very old-
fashioned farm. Worked there for the summer, went back to Sturbridge for 
historical research, Anne was at University of Wisconsin. Fall 1974 moved 
to Madison with her in countryside, got to know old farmers and worked 
there. Anne finished college in 1975, came back to Orleans County in VT, 
rented land to farm. Jack taught adult basic education, Anne sold soaps and

detergents for a while. Started looking for land, summer 1976 bought first 
60 acres here. Had good soil, good views, have been here almost 40 years 
now. Both VT and Wisconsin were dairy states, but in Wisconsin most 
farmers grew their own grain for their cows, and farmers in VT bought it.  
Jack wanted to grow own grain too. Summer 1977 first year of crops on 
farm, did everything old-fashioned way. In Wisconsin were a lot of Amish 
harvesting grain old way too, so learned that. Used to drive 30 miles north 
of border, saw them growing their own grain too, so knew it was possible. 
Started to talk to people, found old reaper and thresher machine, grew 6 
acres wheat, got to know older farmers who were interested in watching. 
Has been great ever since. Was really interested in history of development 
of agricultural technology, so wanted to do things the old way. Made silage 
old-fashioned way, cut it in field, brought to silo filler, shoveled in on silo 
belt. Started with milk cans, everyone had them for free or low cost so low 
cost to start farming, plus was fun to connect with older farmers about it. 
Helped them gain respect in community. All about how hard you want to 
work, cleared land of a lot of stones, community was impressed. Theme for 
their farm is not being afraid to try things and like to collaborate and get 
advice from people who have more experience. 
00:09:13-00:22:35 
Got to know a lot of farmers, and found there was a culture of grain. People 
grew oats in 50s/60s, then in 70s had wet years and stopped growing oats 
for grain and made hay instead. Milton Hammond had old grinder, brought 
wheat berries to him to grind. Had Northeast Kingdom Food Co-op at the 
time, offered wheat flour and people didn’t want it. Local food movement 
was 25 years away at time, but for Jack and Anne always about that. Main 
goal was growing wheat for own flour for own bread. Has been successful. 
Use d to go to Quebec, got to know variety of farmers there. Got seed cleaner 
there in 1980s, still use it, also got combine. Inherited a lot of grain 
equipment from older farmers. Aside about getting to know older farmer in

Wisconsin. Also other neighbor in VT, shared equipment and helped fix 
them too. “It’s all about people I think.” Other couple who were dairy 
farmers were mentors to working with livestock, friendly with their kids 
who are now adults. Were counterculture when started, but were always 
highly interest in history of agriculture and allowed them to have a foot in 
both worlds. Went to hippie parties and knew alternative young people, 
also knew a lot of local and older people because of interests. Were very 
much embraced by the community, all interested in same thing. When 
started farm, had first and only daughter, started with 2 cows then 
expanded dairy farm there. Bought more cows, made cheese, yoghurt, 
cottage cheese, butter, then fall 1979 started selling raw milk and other 
products off of sled with workhorse. People were very excited to buy, 
especially locals. Did that for 3 years, then started selling to stores like City 
Market, Hunger Mountain Co-op, and others. Department of Agriculture 
tested their product, label never said it was raw milk cottage cheese but 
passed health standards. Department visited farm, said they needed a 
license to sell food, so started to build barn summer 1981 for business on 
road to avoid transport to road from house. Built everything old-fashioned 
way, built foundation and everything themselves. Moved cow sin fall 1983, 
yoghurt room finished upstairs next year. Got Milk Handlers License, 
started going to stores because knew everyone working there.  
00:22:35-00:26:55 
Originally planned on being homesteaders with diversified farm to feed 
themselves. Quickly became apparent that going to town required money, 
so had to sell something. Turned into quasi-commercial operation. In 
beginning made yoghurt, butter, cheese, all different dairy products. 
Yoghurt became very popular, was easiest thing to do and had high returns 
versus labor, so became specialized in yoghurt. Skim milk yoghurt was most 
popular, used extra cream to make butter but didn’t have good equipment 
or space to make butter. Tried selling cream to restaurants, then started

growing that. Business growth has been very organic, never more than 5-
10% growth/year, nothing got ahead of them. When first got license only 
had 6 cows, then six months later had calves and each year operation grew. 
Mid-1990s had 45 cows. Grow Jersey cows, have high butterfat and high 
protein. Good for cheese and yoghurt. 
00:26:55-00:32:07 
Learned most things from book by Max Alth about how to process milk. 
Written in lay language, learned at home, used canning kettles. Got culture 
at Kraft Cheese Plant. Went to farmers market with icebox of products, used 
to have vegetables for sale too but quickly realized it was not their specialty 
or passion. Really liked milk processing and were good at it. May be first 
micro dairy. 20 years before their start, were small dairies all over state. 
Then larger dairies bought out smaller ones, then big ones consolidated. 
Aside about string of dairies buying one another leading up to Hood. Got a 
lot of equipment through auctions. Met Kevin Johnston from NH who helped 
Stoneyfield yoghurt get started, liked their product and helped them find 
equipment and get started. “I think it’s all about being out there, being 
friendly and receptive, and it all comes to you really…it’s still the way I 
operate, I don’t know any other way to do it really.”

When started grain, was for own bread and livestock needs. First 15 years 
didn’t grow corn, tried in beginning and didn’t have right varieties. 1990 
were selling a lot of hay, bought corn from NY, but didn’t want to sell hay so 
started growing own corn again. Saw a lot of people in Canada growing corn 
for grain as well, started getting their seeds and their varieties did well 
here. “One of my goals had always been to be able to produce all of the seed 
that I want, that I use for my crops here. I think for us with our anti-
corporate bent, whatever we were doing was to sort of not be part of the 
system.” Friend started breeding new variety of corn, tried it in VT and it 
did really well. Brought corn back to Cornell for processing because it was 
their test, worked well, then started processing seed himself. Can save seed

from it because not hybrid. Started growing and saving seed from soybean, 
Mark Boyden uses some of those as well now. Oats, barley, and wheat were 
easy, but corn and soybeans different. Growing row crops doesn’t help build 
soil, so now moving more towards just cereal crops and moving away from 
row crops. Corn grown for human consumption, sell cornmeal at City 
Market. Early Riser Corn very well known in Vermont. 
00:37:05-00:38:58 
To save seed from field, especially from grain, has to be nice field of grain. 
Decide how much seed you need, then harvest desired crop first to maintain 
purity. If don’t have good crops, buy seed in, but usually can use own. Lacey 
barley does well, oats and wheat varieties also doing well.

Started farm with 60 acres, now have 450 acres. Home farm is 175 acres, 
100 open land, 75 wooded. 1 mile down road have upper and lower 
wasteland, rent that. 1994 started renting land in North Troy, 800ft. lower 
in elevation, much warmer so started growing corn and soybeans there. 
Own 160 acres there along river. Cows need home farm for hay and grazing, 
rented land can go towards crops.

Got first culture through the mail, used recipe from book that called for non-
fat milk. Shook culture in jar of milk, made yoghurt with milk from first cow. 
Had huge surplus of milk from that cow, fed it to many animals on farm but 
still had a lot. Jack came up with yoghurt idea, once had one quart could 
make others and took it around neighborhood to try selling it. Was very 
creamy, tasted like whole milk yoghurt even though skim. Would make 
butter using cream off of yoghurt, how farm got name. But realized how 
hard butter was to make and process and package, rarely make butter now. 
Started making yoghurt in kitchen, then got more cows and found yoghurt 
helpful to sell their milk. Pasteurized milk on farm, incubated milk in variety 
of creative ways to make yoghurt. Everything had more than one purpose.

By 1981 making dairy products from 4-6 cows, were really busy, started 
sending products to Burlington for a bakery. Were running out of 
refrigerator space, used neighbor’s home to refrigerate yoghurt and use 
their water because own house didn’t have running water when being built. 
Was a community effort. Lots of community involvement. Summer 1982 
had 6 apprentices, everyone was busy all the time making stuff or washing 
dishes. 
00:48:05-00:55:25 
Stopped working off farm 1979. Had daughter, were pretty poor. Raised 
meat birds but had so little money had to sell them all. Lots of way to make 
money. Jack was getting interested in land fertility but didn’t have money to 
make that happen until later. “We were building up what my father used to 
call ‘sweat equity’: working very had for very little and eventually things 
would start to shift in a positive direction if you could find ways to raise the 
animals and then sell the products.” Had daughter and started business all 
at once, daughter grew up a lot in yoghurt room. Worked all day, didn’t have 
a lot of help, had daughter sleep in yoghurt room if work went late after 
evening chores. Lots of adaptations to make everything work. Once got milk 
license, then had money to improve land and increase fertility. That was 
turning point, realized that you could take care of land and cow health 
improved, yields improved, everything got better. Slow process over 10-15 
years, but many experiments along the way. One of Jack’s friends Fred 
Franklin passionate about mineralizing soil, legend among organic farmers, 
he’s passed now. Found out mineral balances of soils and amendments. 
Aside about working with difficulty and experiences working with minerals. 
Mineral dust and grinding grain into fine dust may have given Jack asthma, 
but don’t regret it.

dairy farmers associated yoghurt with bad milk, thought it was tainted. 
00:56:54-01:14:40 
When they started dairy farming, organic trend just beginning. Organic 
Pioneers group early interest in organic. Didn’t want to use antibiotics on 
themselves or herds, tried on a few cows. Stopped treating cows for 
mastitis, kept milking them and they got better on their own. Was no 
certified organic structure, NOFA started around 1982 and was no place for 
dairy, only vegetable farmers. Not until 1987/9 neighbor dairy wanted to be 
certified organic, got his approved then got Jack and Anne to be organic too. 
Were no standards, so wrote their own with farmer friend. Wanted their 
products to be healthier. Had to make standards within limits of the time, 
there was no organic feed, had to take care of sick animals, but was large 
incentive to have fertile soil. Were pioneers in keeping cows healthy 
without conventional solution. First allowed antibiotics, then changed to 
only in dire circumstances, now still allowed but have to sell cow to 
conventional farmer or sell for beef. Organic dairy won’t let cow die just 
because of lack of antibiotics. 1990 organic farmers hired PA vet who knew 
homeopathy from England, gave presentation. Many people didn’t 
understand it, but Anne liked ideas of curing cows with natural medicines, 
very different way of looking at treating illness. After 20 years of 
experimenting could treat own cows successfully, and found more vitamin 
and mineral supplements without other medications to combine with 
homeopathic solutions. Worked 9/10 times with cows. Organic rules very 
similar to what they had already been doing, always wanted it to be less 
conventional. Only a few people were trying to be organic, then The Organic 
Cow dairy company in 1990s got people to transition and started bottling 
organic milk in Tunbridge, VT. People could then transition to organic in 30 
days. Wasn’t a lot of organic feed available, so standards designed around it 
to have some conventional grain with organic hay. Gradually as 
infrastructure became available with organic grain, standards raised.

Wouldn’t have happened if demand wasn’t there, starting with Organic Cow. 
Couldn’t have done that movement alone, didn’t want to be large and 
aggregating milk from other farms. Organic Cow was from Peter Flint, had 
herd of Jersey Cows in Tunbridge, VT, built plant there to process milk and 
make cartons. Bottled organic milk, good at getting it to market and there 
was growing demand for organic products in urban areas. Sold some of his 
business to Hood, Horizon Dairy bought it form Hood. Peter Flint started 
Organic Cow 1991/2, Hood bought it 1998. Masters student under Bob 
Parsons at UVM was doing history of organic dairy. National organic 
standards originally passed in 1992 by congress, but not instituted until 
1998 because USDA had to write standards. Each state had own standards 
and problems, met annually to discuss best practices. USDA took away local 
power, climactic conditions and practices very different in every geographic 
region so need local governance, but USDA made it so large companies 
could get into organic dairy. Vermont had set of standards created and 
amended by farmers annually starting 1985. Progression of organic food 
from set of incidents. First, was 60-minute TV special on ALAR, poison used 
on apples. People were upset, huge rise in demand for organic fruits and 
vegetables. Second, rise in rBST pushed organic milk industry. “It’s so 
interesting that people make changes usually for negative reasons. Even 
now you find people will switch to an organic diet because they got a bad 
health diagnosis.” Anne likes to encourage people to eat organic food 
because it takes care of earth, but people don’t think about that if not 
farmers themselves. People who buy organic generally not aware of that 
either, not necessarily interested.

Jack’s Dad worked for Monsanto as plastics chemist but also got organic 
gardening magazines, but not until 1980s did corporations get greedy. Once 
had daughter saw things differently. In 1970s put commercial fertilizer on 
pasture for better growth, Jack started growing grain and had weed

problem. Anne’s brother worked for chemical herbicide company, but 
decided wasn’t what they wanted with child on property. Didn’t like using 
antibiotics on cows either. Had best luck with homeopathy, more people in 
VT started to use it and formed community to draw more teachers and 
workshops. Helps to handle and observe cows more, can’t tell you what’s 
wrong so have to be intuitive with animals. Sometimes ask vet for their 
opinion, but usually have to figure out own solutions because vet tends to 
have invasive methods. Some vets were very upset, felt threatened that 
people weren’t using their knowledge and felt like had no way to serve 
farmers, felt it was unfair for farmers not to use vets. Vets also had very few 
solutions, typically only 3 and didn’t always fully address the problem. Now, 
several companies make products similar to conventional products to help 
farmers transition. 
01:20:07-01:24:48 
As organic agriculture has grown, Jack and Anne have gotten to know more 
people in organic world from other places as people come to VT to give 
talks, sell products, learn. Became good friends with many of these people, 
farmers and non-farmers. Learned from one another, all about sharing. Had 
a lot of interns on farm when starting, 1-2 typically lived with them, then 
built cabin for workers to live in too. Amazing that people wanted to learn 
and were willing to work with them for little pay. Interns helped complete 
invaluable work, made it possible for Lazor’s to do their business. Made 
friends with many workers, many of them have their own farms. In 
beginning had several Canadians. Aside about particular Canadian worker, 
later workers remaining friends. Visit old workers on their farms now, 
exciting to see them being creative with their own business.

has 40 years of experience, but 10 years ago UVM would not have farmer 
teaching a course. Now, recognizing importance of practical experience in 
learning agronomy. Has had good experience working with UVM. Teaches 
once a week for 2 hours, not very flexible about some things but it works in

Working on passing down roles on farm, Anne has been working on it 
longer than Jack. 8 years ago Anne started working with son-in-law in barn. 
2007 started to transition into to LLC’s out of business, started to transition 
daughter and son-in-law into owners of farm real estate. He was interested 
in taking on more responsibilities, works with Anne now and takes on more 
work each year. Anne very impressed with his work and knowledge. 
Everyone has different way of managing their work and leisure, and 
daughter/son-in-law are raising family and homeschooling. Anne and Jack 
only had one daughter and sent her to school to have her out of the house to 
give them time for work, while daughter has larger family and needs to 
work with that. Jack and Anne both very passionate about their business, 
always wanted it to be successful and did whatever it took. Bottom line for 
success is also taking really good care of soil, do very little plowing. Partly 
because knew soil had lots of stones, not worth the effort and time. Plow 
some land in valley without stones, but not around home. The less tilling the 
better it got, which was hard to believe at first. Have to manage chemistry of 
soil, its physical structure, and its biological side. If all things in place, soil 
starts providing for pasture and cows better, milk tastes better, more plant 
diversity. Have developed composting, not afraid to try new things, always 
looking for the best way to do something. Part luck, a lot of hard work, a lot 
of people who have helped and made it possible. Have found excellent 
people to do their work with good character, vision, respect. Are always 
friendly to people so people want to work there. Apprentices, employees,

friends all great help to the farm. Has made life wonderful. Now trying to 
transition to daughter and son-in-law plus others as management team. One 
is plant manager, other is second barn manager. Wanted to help daughter’s 
family manage farm and family together. Slow transition and big learning 
curve, have to mesh personalities, skills, passions, and goals. Jack and Anne 
are still learning, still have challenges.

Have 12-15 paid employees, changes with seasons. Make yoghurt year-
round, but in winter cows mostly stay in barn so have fewer employees. 
Grind grain, lay hay, milk cows, make yoghurt, packing and shipping for 
yoghurt, pasteurization. In summer add people to help with fieldwork. One 
of Jack’s main realizations is having hard time letting go but need to share 
every decision and factor with people taking over the farm. Need to teach 
people, but haven’t taught own family as much as others. Harder to teach 
family because not just employees, have connection. Are very similar to 
daughter and have hard time getting along when working, so working on 
cooperating. Some days very hard to work together. Daughter working in 
his shadow, Jack has hard time letting go, but also very good in the business 
in her own way. Like that on every farm when multiple generations are 
involved. Want farm to remain in family, want transition to be positive but 
is very challenging. Other farm friends say the same thing, not always easy. 
Have created and grown with farm, but also have child who has also grown 
up on farm but has different way of going about life. Can be challenging. 
Daughter is amazing cook.

about one year ago, other group before that, and Vermont Housing and

with employees about vision, Jack stressed importance of passion and being 
able to expand your own expertise and interests within the business. 
Everyone is constantly improving, including farmers. Heather Darby does 
trial plots on farm annually, watching her experiments very interesting and 
educational, she shares her knowledge. As farmer, Jack feels he has 
improved in last decade immensely through sharing of knowledge.

Jack very good at marketing, has helped them begin and continue business. 
Jack could find market for any product, wouldn’t throw anything away.  
Natural foods sector and interest has grown in northeast and especially in 
VT, has become more mainstream but also more corporate. Natural food 
distribution owned by one company nationwide, United Natural Foods Inc. 
Has made it difficult for small producers to persist. Butterworks does self-
distribution for majority of Vermont, Black River Produce distributes the 
rest. Sold to other distributors in past and to Northeast Co-ops, others 
merged to become UNFI and prices went down. Northeast Co-ops went out 
of business and bought out by UNFI, who is sole supplier of Whole Foods. As 
VT business continues to grow steadily, out of state business with UNFI has 
gone down for percentage of total sales. UNFI is so corporate, has tiers of 
contracts and producers give up all rights and get charged, fined, 
repeatedly. UNFI takes back 14% of money their farm should be earning 
from them. “It makes you feel bitter sometimes, because you’re really just a 
country bumpkin trying to make good food for people and get it out to the 
marketplace, and you really kind of get lost in the shuffle.” Current strategy 
is to sell much more yoghurt in VT, would prefer not to sell to UNFI. Places 
for new markets in VT include Shaw’s, Price Chopper, institutions 
(hospitals, schools). Diane Imrie at University of Vermont Medical Center

wants 6-oz yoghurts for hospital, so bought expensive machine to make that 
happen within the year. Marketing has mostly depended on word of mouth 
and good will, but probably need more than that now. Jack is outgoing, but 
also has trouble patting himself on the back, thinks humility sells your 
product but sees other products and people without good stories and 
promoting their products. Realizes they could do more to promote their 
product, social media or other. Next generation more familiar with that, 
encouraging them to follow that path but farm keeps you so busy there’s 
little time to do anything else. Someone advised them to build on your 
strengths, their strength is good reputation for taking care of land. Partly 
because of welcoming and warm attitude to everyone, but Jack is not 
dealing with stores as much anymore to help promote their brand. Need to 
sort out gifts of employees to make business function best. In past, met 
customers’ requests for favors, small local businesses with tiny orders, but 
felt like depended on them as much as big accounts. Now, difficult 
customers with difficult needs getting lost in the shuffle, but don’t want that 
to happen. All about customer service, want all people to feel good buying 
product. But hard to manage when not doing it yourself (Jack and Anne).

Sales recently have plateaued. When started, were only selling in VT and 
were huge changes seasonally in sales depending in weather, vacations, 
seasons. Once entered farther markets, helped level sales. Now receding 
from external markets, may go back to seasonal variability more. Used to 
have more products too, also used to take week off during Christmas but 
would make cheddar cheese with milk from that week. Tried to pay 
employees during week off. Shelburne Farms and Grafton Village Cheese 
would help with cheesemaking, helped to balance. Also used to make a lot of

materials to create yoghurt for hospital. Reluctant because have been 
keeping debts low and paid for, but machine is expensive and taxes will be 
high, so may need to borrow money from bank to pay taxes which will be 
first time. Do have great bookkeeper, similar to business manager because 
knows all details of taxes. Also a strict rule follower but helps keep them out 
of trouble. United States Department of Labor visited farm several years 
ago, tried to tell them they had to manage farm and employees differently 
because of processing involved with products, would have to pay them 
more. Made Jack very depressed, already trying hardest to pay good wages 
and couldn’t afford another increase. Already paid high above minimum 
wage, then had to pay back overtime to employees who didn’t even work 
there. Are just big enough to be in limelight of regulatory agencies, getting 
checked on a lot by all different agencies. Taking enthusiasm and 
profitability out of their business, already get to keep little amount of 
money they make. It’s disappointing to be trying to make small business 
profitable and then having to deal with people trying to take that away. 
History of their farm and business has always been called only a farm, wrote 
off all expenses as farm expenses, considered yoghurt income as farm 
income. Now, can’t do that. Used to be able to return majority of money 
from cash flow into local economy, back into business, to build and buy new 
things. Can’t do that today, IRS keeps changing tax laws to make it harder to 
keep income. Doesn’t mind paying taxes, but seems like small business get 
hit particularly hard. Government requires insurance that you have to buy 
from private for-profit companies, they set the rate, and if you use it your 
rates go up or they drop you. Seems like they have a license to steal from 
you.

New equipment is to replace old equipment that is breaking down in 
addition to hospital’s request for new yoghurt. Cost of small yoghurts may 
be a little high, but if machine can cut down labor could cut down those
