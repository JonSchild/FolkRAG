Is your answer yes or no? 
Tell me, darling, ere I

I 
have waited, love, to hear, waited; 
Yes, wish, hope and fear. 
While I

While my arms about you twine, 
Speak the answer sweet and low, 
Tell me is it yes or no. 
While I

While my arms about you twine, 
Speak the answer sweet and low, 
Tell me is it yes or no ? 
Is your answer yes or no? 
On your cheeks I 
see a 
glow. 
I 
am waiting your reply, 
And I 
listen to your sigh; 
But the answer that I 
seek, 
Will my little darling speak? 
Now, I'm sure, before I 
go. 
That you will not whisper no. 
While I 
clasp, &c. 
Is your answer yes or no? 
My poor fate I 
fain would know. 
Do not turn thy cheeks aside ; 
On my breast thy blushes hide; 
Don't be silent, break the spell 
Ere I 
leave this mossy dell. 
Darling, speak before I 
go, 
Tell me is it yes or no ?

MEDLEY, 
Sung by EVA BENNE-rr, 
You must know that my uncle is a 
farmer, 
Keeps a 
large farm in the West, 
While staying there I 
met a 
little charmer, 
And many's a 
time I 
caressed 
This boy so fair, with nut brown hair. 
His equal ne'er was seen, 
And where I 
met this charming little pet 
Was down by the old mill stream. 
Down by the old mill streom, 
Where many happy hours I've seen. 
';trolling day by day, we passed the time away, 
Down by the old mill stream. 
D. 0-n 
by the old mill stream, 
.1.nere merry happy hours I've seen. 
StrAling day by day, the time I 
passed away, 
gliding down the stream. 
Beneath the bright moonlight, 
When love a 
floating, cupid's boating. 
Beauties ever seen gliding dcr.vn a 
stream. 
Beneath the bright moonlight. 
Down by, &c. 
My joy. you know, is with my beau, 
-Under the lilac, under the lilac. 
Talking of love on a 
bright summer day. 
tinder the lilac, under the lilac; 
He lovingly hugs me and he kissed. and I 
wouldn't say no, 
I 
wouldn't say no. I 
wouldn't say no. 
He hugged me and he tickled me under the chin, 
He did.. 
it again and again, 
I 
liked it, you know, and I 
didn't say no. 
Down by, &c. 
But I 
am such a 
shy young girl, 
Do, da, day, do, da, day, 
Eyes like diamonds, teeth like pearls, 
Do da, do, da, day. 
sow, there's a 
gentleman sitting then!, 
Do, da, day, do, da, day. 
He's asked me already to name the day. 
Do, da. do da, day. 
(Business speaking . — I 
know you, you rascal: you are like all 
the rest of the young men.) 
You all do it ; you all do it 
you all do it : 
And some time you'll rue it; but you all do it. 
And don't you wish that you were me. 
There is no use saying no ; 
The boys, they say, I'm just the thing, 
I 
suppose they ought to know. 
They say I've got such graceful style. 
And my laugh in the air keeps ringing, 
And then my dancing all 0. K.. 
And you can't discount my singing. 
So let this world go as it may, 
You'll always find that I 
am 
To please you all is my delight. 
I'll sing and dance for you all night

Come o'er the lake with me, love, 
The moon is shining bright, 
Upon yon mimic sea, love, 
We'll float in her silver light; 
The balmy summer breeze, love, 
Scarce moves the passive tide, 
As it plays among the trees, love, 
That line the water's side. 
Come o'er the lake with me, love, 
The moon is shining clear and bright; 
Upon yon mimic sea, love, 
We'll float in her silver light. 
Sweet scents from new mown hay, love, 
Ascend from mead and vale, 
And from the forest gray, love, 
Trills forth the nightingale. 
They've left their gorgeous caves, love, 
Those naiads fair to play, 
On the lightly rippling waves, love, 
Where mombeams sparkle gay. 
Come o'er the lake, etc. 
THE OLD ARK'S A 
MOVING. 
Camp meeting song, original, by Mr. FRANK BENNETT. 
Away down South, where I 
was born, 
The old ark's a 
moving, a 
moving along, 
Among the sugar cane and corn, 
The old ark's a 
moving, a 
moving along; 
Then old massa promised me, 
The old ark's a 
moving, a 
moving along, 
That when he died he'd set me free, 
Oh, the old ark's a 
moving, a 
moving along. 
CHORUS. 
Then the old ark's a 
moving, a 
moving along. 
Then the old ark's a 
moving, a 
moving, a 
moving, 
The old ark's a 
moving, a 
moving along. 
When I 
die I 
want to rise high, 
The old ark's a 
moving, a 
moving along, 
Way up yonder in the sky, 
The old ark's a 
moving, a 
moving along; 
And sister Sal and my aunt Sue, 
The old ark's a 
moving, a 
moving along, 
Said they'd surely be there, too, 
The old, ark's a 
moving, a 
moving along. 
Then the old ark's, Ite. 
ISN'T HE A 
DARLING? 
Sung with great success by EvA BENNETT. 
by J. P. SKELLY. 
I 
have a 
beau, a 
charming beau, 
Of him I'm very proud. 
When on the promenade we go 
We meet a 
wondering crowd. 
He's quite a 
swell in all his ways, 
And speaks with voice divine, 
I 
can't find words enough to praise 
This charming beau of mine. 
CHORUS. 
Words and music 
Oh, isn't he a 
darling, with his graceful way, 
And his eyes so gay ? 
Yes, he's a 
little darling. 
To me he is divine. 
He dresses in the latest style, 
And wears a 
diamond ring. 
And when he's out in company 
How sweetly he can sing. 
His business, well, upon my word, 
It must be something fine, 
For he has always lots of cash 
This charming beau of mine. 
Oh, ain't he, kc. 
THE BOYS FOR ME. 
Sung by EVA BENNETT. 
Written by George Cooper. 
Music 
by G. Operti. 
My name is Clementina Araminta Saucy Jane, 
If not exactly pretty, I 
am certainly not plain; 
I 
hate all bashful, shy young girls, admire a 
dashing man. 
And flirt with all, but I 
intend to marry if I 
can. 
CHORUS. 
The dashing, flirting, jolly swell, who's always gay and free, 
You, perhaps, may think me rather quick, but he's the boy for 
me; 
Dashing swells, jolly swells, romping swells are the boys for 
me, 
Dashing swells, jolly swells, romping swells are the boys for 
me. 
I 
love to promenade Broadway and see the funny sights, 
To mash the chaps who wink at me is one of my delights; 
I 
dote upon a 
fine mustache, it may be wrong, you see, 
But if the wearer, if he's nice, is just the boy for me. 
The dashing, kc. 
Pd like to capture, if I 
could, a 
chap to suit my mind, 
He must be handsome, got the stamps, and always good and 
kind, 
So if there's any out of all, the faces here I 
see, 
'Who'd like to take me as I 
stand ? 
Oh, he's the boy for me. 
The dashimr. 
A 
LOOK OF MY MOTHER'S HAIR. 
Words by FRANK DUMONT. 
Music by EDDIE Fox. 
Sung with great success by EVA BENNETT. 
I've a 
letter that was written long ago, 
'Tis a 
letter that I've treasured many years : 
Oh. how often I 
have read those fading lines, 
And over them there's traces of my tears; 
She sent to me her blessing in that missive, 
To see me was her constant prayer; 
The little lock of gray in this old letter, 
Es a 
lock of my angel mother's hair. 
I've a 
letter that was sent me long ago. 
A 
letter that I 
keep with tender care; 
The little lock of grayin this old letter, 
Ts a 
lock ot mv angel mother's hair. 
I've a 
letter that was written long ago. 
That was sent to me across the stormy sea; 
When 'mong strangers I 
was wandering far away, 
And longing home again to ever be. 
But underneath the sod my mother's sleeping. 
She's free from earthly trials and its care: 
But ever next my heart I'll keep herletter 
And the lock of my angel mother's hair. 
I've a 
letter, etc. 
Oh! I 
love a 
charmer—a 
sweet little maid— 
With eyes like the stars in the sky, 
Her home is a 
cot in a 
green, mossy glade, 
Where a 
swift flowing brook ripples by; 
'Tis fair as an Eden with beautiful flowers, 
And there day by day at her side, 
Together we talk of the bright happy hours 
We'll pass when I 
claim her my bride. 
.CHORUS 
Under the lilacs, under the lilacs, 
Talking of love on a 
bright summer's day. 
Under the lilacs, under the lilacs, 
Together we lovingly pass time away. 
One warm day in summer we sat ' Death the shade, 
Her hand within mine I 
held fast. 
So earnestly talking to her, I'm afraid 
I 
knew not how quickly time passed; 
I 
begged her to join me through life's coming hours. 
She promised that she'd be my wife, 
How I 
bless the day, when ' neath the lilac's sweet flowers, 
won, her, my darling, for life.

LITTLE DARLING, DO YOU LOVE ME? 
Written and sung by BEN DODGE. 
Little darling, do you love me, 
Will you ever care for me? 
While far from you I 
am wandering, 
O'er life's dark and stormy sea; 
For I 
cherish you so fondly, 
And my heart will e'er be true, 
And in time I'll gladly hasten 
Back again to home and you. • 
CHORUS. 
Little darling, do you love me? 
Will you ever care for me. 
While far from you I 
am wandering, 
O'er life's dark and stormy sea ? 
Little darling do you miss me 
As away from you I 
roam ? 
Will you greet me with a 
welcome 
When we meet again at home? 
Shall I 
feel your hand's warm pressnre, 
See your bright and happy smile, 
And, far better, hear you whisper— 
" 
I 
have loved you all the while!" 
Little darling, etc. 
DOWN BY THE' MILL. 
Words by FRANK DUMONT. 
Music by EDDIE - - 
Sung with great success by EVA BENNETT. 
At night, when the shadows are falling, 
On the meadow, the' vale and the stream, 
And the nightingale softly is calling, 
And nature's preparing to dream; 
Then, darling, remember your promise, 
I'll wait for you down by the mill, 
I'll watch for your coming, so hasten, 
When the moon rises over the hill. 
CHORUS. 
To-night, when the shadows are falling, 
I'll wait for you down by the mill; 
I'll watch for your coming, so hasten, 
When the moon rises over the hill. 
To-night, when the whippoorwill's calling, 
I 
have something to whisper to you, 
'Tis a 
secret I 
long to impart, love, 
I 
promise each word shall be true; 
kiss you to keep it a 
secret, 
And, darling, I'm sure that you will, 
It only concerns you and I, love, 
So hasten down to the mill. 
To-night, etc.

A 
HIT HIM AGAIN, HE'S GOT NO FRIENDS, 
Sung with great success by TONY PASTOR. 
The ups and downs of this great world, 
Would till a 
mighty book, 
But those in luxury pass by, 
And seldom chance to look 
On those whom fortune has not blest, 
With friendship's pitying eye. 
But hear his story with a•shrug, 
And coldly pass him by (with)— 
CHORUS. 
Hit him again, he's got no friends, 
Drive him away from the door; 
Hit him again, he's got no friends, 
What good is a 
man when he's poor ? 
A man of wealth may be a 
lion 
In party, club or ball, 
Courted by men of high degree, 
By ladies great and small; 
But speculations fickle hand, 
May sweep away his gold, 
What then do men of high degree, 
What will the ladies say ? (why)— 
Hit him again, etc. 
But then the road is very long, 
That turns not in its way, 
For tides will rise, the cat will mew, 
The dog will have his day; 
The rich man now may then be poor, 
The poor man have his place, 
And he who snubs to- day may look 
Into the other's face (and say)— 
Hit him again, etc.

BARNUM'S GREAT "FAIR, 
Words by BABY MANCHESTER. 
AIR.— Ting, Ti ,g." 
I 
never shall forget the first time I 
went 
To see Barnum's Great World's Fair, 
The menagerie was crowded, the circus was full, 
And so was most any one there. 
The women with whiskers had just got sliowed, 
And caught the barber's itch, 
And a 
cage full of monkeys were having some furl 
With a 
deck of cards playing auction pith. 
CHORUS. 
Oh. wasn't it funny to see such a 
sight; 
We all went home delighted that night. 
You may think I'm fooling, but you ought to have been there, 
To see all the sights at Barnum's Great Fair. 
Now the next sight I 
saw was a 
lion in the cage— 
It was funny it had but four legs; 
I 
asked what they fed him to make him so fat. 
They said it was scrambled shoe pegs. 
The giraffe was next with a 
great long neck, 
And the elephant was playing with his sister ; 
He kissed her so hard upon her front tooth, 
That he raised a 
great big war 
blister. 
Oh, Nvasn't it funiay, 
THEY'VE ALL GOT A 
WIFE MIT ME. 
- 
Written and sung by BEN DODGE. 
A story true I'll tell to you, 
Of the troubles of my life; 
Though in love I've been—like many other men— 
I 
never could get a 
wife. 
For the girls are so shy, (but I 
can't tell why), 
And sad it is to relate; 
Though I've tried and tried, till I've almost died, 
Still I 
cannot find a 
mate. 
CHORUS. 
There's the monkey and the dog, the turtle and the frog. 
The fishes that swim in the sea; 
And the pretty little squirrel, with his tail up in a 
curl, 
Oh, they've all got a 
wife but me. 
When first in love, head o'er heels I 
dove, 
It was with a 
girl named Lize; 
She'd a 
nose hard to beat, she'd number ten feet, 
And a 
pair of codfish eyes. 
I 
offered my hand, in a 
style quite grand, 
And what do you suppose ? 
She said very cool that she wasn't such a 
fool, 
And she turned up her pretty little nose. 
SPOREN.—It made me outrageously mad to think that she 
went back on me after I'd squandered all my wealth upon her— 
not that I 
cared for tile money, but I 
hated to realize that-
1 
7 
CHORUS. 
There's the chicken and the cat, the weasel and the rat, 
The skeeter and the bumble bee; 
The cunning little lizard and the naughty old buzzard, 
Oh, they've all got a 
wife but me. 
My love number two, was a 
girl named Sue, 
Who clerked in a 
dollar store;, 
Each day I 
dressed in all my best. 
And wandered past the door. 
I 
wrote her a 
letter—(oh. I 
ought to known better,) 
And asked her to share my lot; 
Next day I 
met her " feller," and he thumped me in the smell-
er, 
That was all the answer I 
got. 
SPOKE. — Oh, I 
tell you it is a 
horrible thing to contemplate 
—just to think that I 
am left to enjoy single " wretchedness," 
while— 
CHORUS. 
There's the horse and the steer, the goat and the deer, 
The hornet, the wasp and the flea; 
The fussy little coon, and the ugly old baboon, 
Oh, they've all got a 
wife but me. 
THEY SAID 
SAID I 
COULDN'T DO IT BUT I 
DID. 
Written and sung by BEN DODGE. 
When I 
was but a 
little boy, and toddled off to school, 
The people one and all declared that I'd grow up a 
fool; 
Their sneers and jeers would greet me whichever way I'd turn, 
Because they said good common sense I surely ne'er would 
learn. 
But they were not so much to blame, for ' twixt both you and 
me, 
It nearly took me a 
whole year to learn my A, B, C; 
But I 
succeeded, and at last of their abuse got rid, 
They- 
said ' twas what I 
could not do, but they now confess I 
did. 
CHORUS. 
Oh ! they said I 
couldn't do it, but I 
did, 
They said I 
couldn't do it, but I 
did, 
They vowed I'd be a 
fool, 'cause I 
couldn't learn at school, 
They said I 
couldn't do it, but I 
did. 
As year by year I 
older grew, of course T 
fell in love, 
'Twas with a 
bright and charming girl, fair as the skies above: 
But something very strange, and which I 
could not undel'Stand, 
I 
ne'er could muster Courage up to ask her for her hand. 
I 
called each night, of course, to tell the oft-repeated tale, 
But when the question tried to pop, my nerve would somehow 
fail; 
My friends laughed at me, till one day, with pleasure I 
confess, 
The words slipped out, " Will you be mine ?" and my darling 
answered " Yes." 
CHORUS. 
Oh I 
they said I 
couldn't do it, but I 
did, 
They said I 
couldn't do it, but I 
did; 
Now everybody knows it's a 
hard job to " propose, 
They said I 
couldn't do it, but I 
did. 
My wife and I 
have married been, for full three years or more, 
No children have we raised, and I 
felt tender on that score; 
For every day some friend of mine, in joking tones would sneer, 
And say ' twas his opinion that the case was rather queer. 
It's bothered me much more, my friends, than I 
care to reveal, 
But at last it has come out all right, and a,wtul proud I 
feel; 
Each friend I 
meet upon the street, to wish me joy begins, 
For to-day my wife presented me with a bouncing pair of 
" 
twins." 
CHORUS. 
Oh l 
they said we couldn't do it, but we did, 
They said we couldn't do it. but we did; 
Now we've got a 
girl and boy, who cause us the greatest joys 
They said we couldn't do it, but we did. 
OUR STAR SPANGLED FLAG OF THE 
FREE. 
Written and sung by BEN DODGE. 
I'll ring you a 
song of our glorious flag, 
The emblem of sweet liberty, 
The pride of each true-born American heart, 
Our star spangled flag of the free; 
'Tis loved and respected wherever on earth 
Its bright folds in glory may wave, 
For it speaks of Columbia, the lard of the free, 
And the home of the true and the brave. 
CHORUS. 
Then three rousing cheers for our glorious flag, 
The emblem of sweet liberty; 
'Tis the pride of each true-born American heart, 
Our star spangled flag of the free. 
'Tis but one hundred years since our grandsires of old. 
Declared that their sons should be free, 
And no longer ruled with tyrannical power, 
By England's king, over the sea 7 
They assembled in Congress on the Fourth of July, 
And each pledged his life to be true, 
'Till the day of his death, his country and friends, 
And our banner, the Red, White and Blue. 
Then three rousing cheers, etc. 
Each patriot's heart with true joy overflowed, 
When the " old bell" in tones loud and clear, 
Proclaimed to the world that a 
nation was born, 
Which to freemen would ever be dear; 
A 
great shout of gladness leaped forth from each lip, 
When ' twas first learned the deed had been done, 
For they felt that the God of all battles would bless 
The colors of our Washington. 
Then three rousing cheers, etc. 
The nation our forefathers gave us that day, 
Is acknowledged the best now on earth, 
And the poor emigrant, oft with tears in his eyes, 
Will bless the proud day of its birth; 
For he finds in America a 
land free to all, 
A home free from Tyranny's bars, 
Where the poor and oppressed are protected at last, 
'Neath the folds of the dear stripes and stars. 
Then three rousing cheers, etc.

MY MOTHER-IN-LAW 
Written and sung by BEN DODGE. 
I 
daily am growing depressed and disheartened, 
My griefs and my troubles to you I'll relate; 
Dame Fortune upon me is certainly frowning, 
The cause of my sadness is my cruel fate. 
The whole of my life is o'ereast with a 
shadow, 
For all kinds of pleasure I 
don't care a 
straw; 
It's simply because, like a 
fool, I 
got married, 
And I've got a 
bad ease of a " mother-in-law." 
She comes twice every year to pay us a 
visit, 
And not stretching the truth the least mite, I 
can swear 
That each visit is fully of six months duration. 
And her presence completely fills me with despair. 
When she enters the house then my trouble commences, 
For the whole livelong day she does nothing but jaw; 
How often I've envied onr first father—Adam— 
For he wasn't cursed with a 
mother-in-law. 
Our servant girl, Sarah, is fresh from the country, 
An exceedingly good-natured and pretty young miss, 
One evening, while hugging her down in the kitchen, 
I 
thought I'd endeavor to steal a 
sly kiss. 
Said Sarsh, " Your wife would most surely be jealous. 
If she could but see us;" I 
answered, " Oh. shaw !" 
When the door was burst open, and there stood before us 
That horrid old monster, my mother-in-law. 
The girl was discharged then and I 
soundly rated. 
For I 
couldn't lie out of the matter, of course. 
And my mother-in-law's tongue is constantly running. 
So my wife firmly vows ske will have a 
divorce. 
Now our "Crack Bilk Team" dues some mighty fine sho,iting, 
The result of each match is a'ways a 
draw : 
I'll give any good marksman seven dollars and a 
half 
To take a 
few shots 
t m m 
y ether- in-law.

THE PET OF THE PANTOILIIMt, 
Written and sung by BEN DODGE. 
One evening being at a 
loss for something else to do, 
I 
strolled into a 
concert hall to see what there was new; 
Tine moment I 
had stepped inside I 
was bewildered quite. 
For, oh, a 
vision met my gaze which filled me with delight; 
A 
girl was tripping round the stage to music by the band. 
thought that I 
had never seen a 
sight one half as grand; 
Her movements were so graceful, and her dancing so sublime, 
'Twas madamoiselle, the principal belle, the pet of the Panto-
mime. 
CHORUS. 
For she was all the rage, as she tripped around the stage, 
Her singing and her dancing were divine • 
Admired by all the press. for she was far the best. 
Was madamoiselle, the principal belle, the pet of the Panto-
mime. 
The dance was done. she tripped away, the crowd all yelled en-
core: 
I 
clapped my hands and stamped my feet until they both were 
sore. 
But what cared I 
for that, my boys, I 
did not mind the pain 
I 
only wished to get a 
sight at her sweet face again. 
My efforts were rewarded, for she came back with a 
smile, 
I 
never saw such winning ways or half as charming style. 
I 
fancied her an angel sweet from the skies above. 
For with her, I 
declare, I 
fell head over heels in love. 
For she was, & c. 
I 
sent my card and asked her if I 
on her some day might call; 
She answered " Yes, but come alone, or do not come at all." 
My good luck I 
could scarce believe, I 
knew not w 
hat to say, 
For so completely a 
surprise quite took my breath away. 
Next clay T 
called, but oh. I 
met her husband at the door, 
He kicked me down the stairs and then beat me till I 
was sore 
And then he gave me this advice, " Look out, young man, next 
time, 
Don't try to mash' the Pantaloon's wife, the pet of the Panto-
mime. 
For she was, & c.

WOODsON with great success at the How-
ard Athenmum, Boston. 
I'se gwine back to Dixie, 
No more I'se gwine to wander, 
My heart's turned back to Dixie, 
And I 
can't stay here no longer. 
I 
miss the old plantation, 
My home and my relations, 
My heart's turned back to Dixie, 
And the Lord knows I 
must go. 
CHORUS. 
I'se gwine back to Dixie; I'm gwine to Dixie; 
I'm going where the orange blossoms grows 
I 
hear the children calling, the / eaves on the trees a 
falling, 
My heart's turned back to Dixie, and the Lord knows I 
must go. 
I'se travelling back to Dixie, 
My step is slow and feeble, 
I 
pray the Lord shall help me, 
And lead me from all evil. 
And if my strength forsakes me, 
My kind friends, come and take me; 
My heart's turned back to Dixie, 
And the Lord knows I 
must go. 
I'se gwine back, ie.

You may talk of your la de da fellows, 
Your Hilder Montrose and that kind, 
But in me see the prince of all swell-os, 
None grander than me can you find. 
I'm deucedly fond of the ladies. 
A 
nd the ladies are all fond of me; 
Like a 
bee in a 
garden of daisies, 
I 
flatter myself I'm that bee. 
CHotit:s 
I'm swell of the belles, yon bet, 
The pride of the girls, their pet: 
Oh, dear, how they smile at my exquisite style, 
I'm the swell of all swells, you bet. 
Now, a 
rich uncle lately departed, 
He's gone to that home, bright and fair, 
But he made out his will and started, 
And I 
was his only heir. 
So the few thousand pounds that he left me, 
Urn rapidly turning to cash, 
Now, I'm doing the thing rather Lefty, 
Yes, doing the grand with a 
dash. 
I'm swell, & 
Now, my rule is to honor propriety, 
Smoke " Vanity Fair" cigarettess, 
Drink wine in the best of society, 
Be loved and caressed by the pets. 
The darlings, they all dote upon me, 
Say that I'm too sweet to live, 
They hoax, and they coax and they chaff me, 
And they'll kill me with love, I 
believe. 
I'm swell, izc.

THAT'S WHEN YOU WILL KNOW WHO'S 
YOUR FRIEND. 
Written and sung by BEN DODGE. 
To my true friend W ILL 
MORTON. 
It's all very foolish to boast of your friends, 
And imagine them faithful and true; 
In the hour of misfortue you surely will find 
There's no one with friendship for you. 
Your child may be starviwg and crying for bread. 
No one has a 
penny to lend 
To help drive the dread wolf away from your door— 
That's when you will know who's your friend. 
CEIORUS. 
Then take my advice—it is said for your good— 
Bear in mind -I 
don't wish to offend; 
Being saving of cash, and keep plenty on hand, 
And you never will want for a 
friend. 
While jogging along through the journey of life, 
You are sure to meet sorrow and care; 
But fight boldly onward, throngh thick and through thin, 
And never give up in despair. 
Be honest and upright, whatever you do; 
Your honor at all times defend— 
All men will look up to you then with respect, 
And be proud to be known as your friend. 
Then take my advice, &c. 
Curiosities are all the rage with people now- a-days: 
A museum full of them I've got, and find quite well it pays. 
The funny things which I've secured will please you all, I 
know; 
I've just come back with them, my friends, from the great Cen-
tennial show. 
I've got " the whale that Jonah swallowed," " the fellow who 
couldn't get fat." 
•‘ Boss" Tweed, the man with the educated thumb, and Greeley's 
old white hat, 
I've got a 
horn from ' Sitting Bull," and have lately come across 
The girl with the wart on her elbow, and the original Charley 
Ross. 
I've got an honest Congressman politicians cannot buy, 
And a 
chap who vows, with a 
silver spoon he can straighten 
Ben Butler's eye. 
I've got a 
creature who thinks old Beecher is free from earthly 
sins, 
But the funniest thing which T 
have got, is a 
pair of "old maid's 
twins."

EATING PEANUTS, 
Written and sung by BEN DODGE, 
One day while strolling down the street I 
met a 
lady fair, 
With ruby lips and rosy cheeks, and curly golden hair; 
She was standing in a 
candy store and smiled as I 
passed by, 
bowed, and then she winked at me with her bright blue 
laughing eye. 
I, of course, entered the store and commenced a 
conversation 
with the young lady. 
I 
asked her how she managed to pass 
away her time, and her reply was this: " Part of my time I 
,pass away in waiting on customers, and in dressing and sleeping ; 
but the most of my time I 
pass in— 
" 
Eating peanuts, eating peanuts, 
And oranges too, and of gum drops a 
few, 
And bananas, good bananas, 
That's how I 
pass off all my time." 
We stood, and for about an hour had a 
most pleasant talk; 
I 
asked her if next evening she with me would take a 
walk; 
She said.'twould please her very much, but still I 
felt quite, sad 
To find she'd not give her consent until I 
asked her dad. 
"Nixy weeden; " I 
won't have it;" 
" 
Don't shoot off year chin," for your " racket's" 
too thin," 
" 
Cheese it, Cully ;" " take a 
tumble;" 
" 
Sherry your nibs," and " Get out." 
The fair one vowed she loved me dear, and to me shE.' 
be true, 
But passing there I 
saw next day what made me feel quite blue; 
Near the window by her side there sat a 
chap I'd often met; 
He kissed her right before my face—it made me mad, you bet 
2 ") 
It's enough to make any one mad. 
I 
said to her, " Evelina., 
is it with your consent that he embraces you thusly ?" and she 
replied, " Yea, verily." 
Then she kissed him right before my 
face. 
Then I 
raved and swore; I 
heaped every invective I 
could possibly think of upon their devoted heads. 
Pretty soon 
I 
heard something drop, and on looking up I 
saw they were 
moving the furniture out of the house—in fact, they were heav-
ing it out of the window at me, and there hit me on the top of 
the head— 
A 
bootjack and a 
flat-iron, 
And a 
glass made for beer hit me right in the ear; 
A 
big dipper and a 
skillet, 
Stretched me out my full length on the ground. 
I 
quickly sprang upon my feet and rushed far from the place, 
And cursed the day when first I 
gazed on that deceitful face. 
They've since been married, and I've learned a 
large family they 
have got; 
But since the day that I 
was sold, I've not been near the spot. 
No, I 
don't go there any more, but a 
friend of mine was down 
to their place the other day, and he informs me that they have 
an enormous family. 
When the old man died he left them to 
carry on the business at the same old stand, and he also says 
that from Alpha to the Omega of that entire family, they pass 
their time from morning to night in— 
Eating peanuts, eating peanuts, 
And oranges too, and of gum drops a 
few, 
And bananas, good bananas, 
That's how they pass off all their time.

Come, now, tell me. 
UNCLE JASPER.—Don't ax me, chile: don't ax me.

if dar am anything I 
can do— 
UNCLE JASPER.— Chile, I 
hates to tell you. 
But I 
will tell 
you, Susie. 
Yesterday, when all de hands was coming from 
working in de fields and bringing in de cotton, one ob de baskets 
was missed, and one ob de hands told massa ' twas I 
dat stole 
it. 
Susie, my chile, I 
was born and raised on dis plantation, 
and I 
never as much as stole a 
pin from any one. 
But I 
have 
missed a 
great many things, but I 
never once made a 
complaint 
to him (pause.) 
Massa came to me last night and told me dat 
I 
must leave de place, and he abused me and called me hard 
names. 
But I 
never spoke back to h'm, for massa has always 
been good and kind to me. 
He never in his life spoke cross to 
me before. 
I 
have always been a 
true and faithful slave to 
massa, and I 
am willing to go down on my old hands and knees 
and work for him. 
And let me tell you one thing, Susie; never 
take nuffin' but what belongs to you, 'cause ' taint right. ' Case 
if you do, you will be called away some day to heaven to ac-
count for what you have done in dis wicked world. 
Remem-
ber your poor old mudder and fader when dey am gone, and he 
a 
good girl. 
Always be good and kind to every one, and every 
one will be kind to you. 
(
Kisses her.) 
Dat am what has trub-
bled your old fader. 
SUSIE.—Daddie, I 
don't believe dat you would steal, 'cause 
you're so good and kind to every one. 
Dere must be somebody 
on de plantation dat does not like you, and has stolen de basket 
and blamed you for it, and has made massa abuse you, and turn 
you away from de place. 
(Pause.) 
I must go now, daddie. 
You know dat Dooley promised to take me to de camp-meeting 
to-night. 
(
Exit into cottage.) 
JASPER.—Good-bye, chile. God bless your little heart, honey. 
(Weeps.) 
My heart am sot on dat chile, and if massa was to 
drive me away it would kill me. (Looking off.) 
Yonder comes 
massa now, up de walk. 
He don't seem to be angry. 
(Enter 
Harry through gate.) 
HARRY.—Jasper, I 
came to ask your forgiveness for treating 
you the way I 
did, awhile ago, and I 
hope you will pardon me 
for being so rash. 
JASPER — Forgive you, massa. 
Yes, massa, I 
freely forgive 
you, as I 
hope to be forgiven myself, some day. 
HARRY.—Thanks, Jasper. 
Think no more of it. Jasper. 
(Exit Harry through gate.) 
JASPER (
c. 
alone. laughs)—I knowed it: I knowed it. 
I 
knowed dat I 
was right. 
Lord bless you, massa, I 
never stole 
nuffin in my life.

I'll go right in and tell her all.

DANCING IN THE SUNLIGHT. 
Written and composed by JAMES MAAS for the GIRARD BROTH-
ERS, and sung by them with immense success, at the 
Howard Athenaeum, Boston. 
What a 
pleasure there is in dancing the sunlight, 
When all earth seems to smile; 
It makes a 
merry ringing in your laughter, 
You have no care or guile. 
With ringing notes from pearly throats, 
We while the hours away; 
With beaming smile our time beguile, 
We are always blythe and gay. 
Oh, what a 
pleasure there is dancing in the sunlight, 
When all earth seems to smile; 
it makes a 
merry ringing in your laughter, 
You have no care or guile. 
CHORUS. 
Hark, hark! hear the music ring, (sym.) 
Shout, shout! raise your voice and sing. (sym.) 
What a 
pleasure there is dancing in the sunlight, 
When all earth seems to smile; 
It makes 5. merry ringing in your laughter, 
You have no care or guile. 
What a 
pleasure there is dancing in the sunlight, 
For it will make you glad; 
In the golden rays its shadow it will mock you, 
And whirl and dance like mad. 
When sunset's come, and day is done, 
And darkness claims her right, 
We'll go to rest, and the blest, 
The rays of morning light. 
Oh I 
What a 
pleasure there is dancing in the sunlight, 
When all earth seems to smile; 
It makes a 
merry ringing in your laughter, 
You have no care or guile.

--)ome folks will cry ‘• Oh ! shame, Mrs. Jones, you are to blame, 
never should have thought it, ma'am, of you," 
While, if they'd look at home before abroad they'd roam, 
I'm positive they'd have enough to do. 
Mrs. Brown says it's a 
sin, that Mrs. Smith drinks gin, 
And harbors 
tally-men" from day to day; 
‘Thile Mrs. Green was caught doing what she hadn't ought, 
When she in self defemcs was heard to say— 
CHORUS. 
" 
They all do it, they all do it, 
They all do it, though ofttimes they rue it; 
let they all do it, they all do it, 
And S9 it will continue to tile end of the world!" 
For ',lours three or four, lovers !Tootling at the door, 
On any moonlight evening may be seen ; 
Though if they want a 
lark, they have it in the dark, 
And they " do it," though they say " they didn't mean,.". 
When creeping down the stairs comes the old man unawares 
And kissing catch the couple in the act; 
The mother, from above, says " Don't interfere, my love, 
You can't dispute this most important fact—" 
They all do it, etc. 
Old women do declare, girls should never dye their hair, 
And then again they say it's very wrong; 
Without the least restraint, their faces so to paint, 
And rob the easy chair for their chignon. 
Each girl a 
little puff, has inside a 
little muff, 
They are never seen without it, night or day; 
And her pretty nose she'll powder, if a 
moment is allowed her, 
When, if you laugh, she'll innocently say— 
They all do it, etc, 
I3ut what does most impress, is the style in which they dress, 
It's enough to make you laugh when them you see; 
They've a 
hat upon their heads, large enough to make up beds, 
For pussy cats with kittens two or three. 
In their panniers, too, behind, if examined you would find, 
The most important papers of the day; 
The Chronicle and Chimes, the Telegraph and Times. 
Or anything that chance puts in their way. 
They all do it, etc. 
There's my neighbor, Dinah Down, brught two lovely boys to 
town, 
And her husband gets but one pound one per week: 
You often hear him say, " If things go on this way, 
We'll a 
lodging in the Union have to seek! 
For the doctor and the nurse, will drain my scanty purse, 
With many more expenses to defray:" 
Then he gets into a 
passion, when they tell him 
it's the 
fashion," 
And they soothe him as they sing this truthful lay— 
They all do it, etc.

You've heard aboud a 
gal I

Dot used to be so stout. 
How she " shook " me und just because 
I 
vould not take her out 
To balls and parties und all dot, 
Vich I 
dought vas a 
sin, 
But now I've got a 
new sweetheart, 
Und she is awful thin. 
CHORUS. 
She is so thin, dot vere she here, 
You could not see her; 
don't dot seem queer? 
Bad luck have I—oh, I 
shall die, 
My ViVO is so awfully thin. 
Vere I 
first met dig female straw, 
'Dwas at a 
coundry fair. 
She vos valking long mit her mamma, 
Und she had such nice blonde hair; 
I 
spoke to her, she spoke to me, 
Ye got acquainted den, 
Ye married vere, und after dot 
She commenced to grow thin. 
SPOKEN.—She is the thinnest of the thin. 
She used to vork 
in an insdrument factory, cleaning out flutes; I 
used to play 
" 
Hide und Seek" mit her, und see used to hide in de gas pipe. 
I 
took her oud riding vonce, und I 
grabbed her instead of de 
whip; I 
never took her mid after dot. 
I

at a 
ball vonce, und de floor manager come up und said, " Young 
man, you viii have to leave your cane in de hat room, it's not 
allowed on de floor! 
I

MI VIFE IS SO AWFULLY STOUbe 
Sung by Gus W ILLIAMS with great success. 
Ant.—" My Vife is so Awfully Thin," 
vonce did love a 
voman, dot used t@ be so stoud, 
Und people dey vould laugh at her venever she'd valk oud; 
But sdill i 
loved her druly, I 
knew it vos no sin, 
I 
dought dot in de future she vould gradually grow thin. 
CHORUS. 
She vas so stolid yen she'd valk oud, 
People vould dink dot she vos a 
balloon 
To take dem' up—just like a " scup," 
Und make a 
small call on de man in de moon. 
She looked just like an elephant, she had such a 
bigjear, 
But she could valk as lightly as any person here; 
To tell you all aboud her, I 
now intend to try, 
Und vile I 
am a-speaking, I 
hope you viii not cry. 
SrokEN.—I'll never forget ven I 
firsd got acquainted mit 
her, she vos travelling mit a 
circus, she vos de fat voman, she 
veighed eight hundred pounds; I 
used to call her " Birdie!" 
her right name vos " Ostrich." I 
took her mid sleigh-riding 
vonce, she got in, und dere vas just room for me to " cut on 
behind." 
I 
looked like an icicle on a 
gutter. 
Ve drove out on 
de road, und stopped in front of a 
hotel, de proprietor came 
oud und told me to move avay, as no vone could see de hotel 
vile she stayed dere. 
I 
took her bathing vonce, de moment 
she got in de vater, de tide vent up dree foot, she asked me to 
float her: I 
tried to, but came near drowning; I 
told her I 
vos 
no derrick! 
But she could dance like a fairy—dot is a 
fairy 
her size; I 
used, in valtzin ,,, 
to put my arm around her vaist 
as far as I could, und reach mit a 
boat-hook de rest of de dis-
tance; und she vos an awful eater, she could eat a 
vater-melon 
just as easy as I 
vould take a 
pill. 
I 
took de size of her finger 
vonce to have an engagement ring made; I 
vent down to de 
jeweller. I 
said, " Make me a 
ringdis size, und I 
vant it to fit 
veil." 
He said, " Bring de keg down here, und let me fit it 
on." I 
don't speak to her now, because she vanted me to 
take her to a 
masquerade ball disguised as a 
pipe stem. I 
knew dot every vone vould laugh at me if I 
done so, for 
She vos so stoud, etc.

Come listen awhile to my dit,

I'll very soon get up and git. 
One day I 
was walking the street, 
A

chanced for to meet. 
I 
winked one eye—she looked one eye, 
And smiled on me ever so sweet. 
CHORUS. 
Her hair in golden ringlets hung. 
Her eyes were Heaven's own Mite, 
Gaiters on her tiny fEet 
I 
think were number two. 
Her form was 11108i exquisite, 
Her style was all the rage, 
But she would mash, y 
ou bet she would, 
For she was just the age. 
I 
asked her if she would be mine, 
She said she'd ask papa ; 
The old man thontt-ht I 
had more wealth 
Than the other one by far. 
SO he gave his consent right away, 
And I 
thought I'd a 
dear precious wife, 
So I 
settled down, just outside of town, 
And intended to be happy through life. 
CHORUS. 
But when I 
went out to see the boys 
And left my wife at home, 
She•saiil she was contented 
And loved to be alone. 
But I

Which set me in a

THE RUSTIC YOUNG DAMSEL. 
Written and composed by HARRY LisroN. 
Sung by W ILL 
MARTIN, of Harrigan k 
Hart's Theatre. 
A 
long time ago, I 
remember it well, 
In a 
beautiful village a 
damsel did dwell ; 
Alone with her parents she lived all serene, 
Her age it was red, and her hair was nineteen. 
SPOKEN— Yes, she was a 
generous girl 
she supported plain 
needlework by taking in her poor old father. 
She was called— 
CHORUS. 
A sweet rustic damsel with cheeks like the rose, 
A roman shaped eye, and a 
cast in her nose. 
Now she had a 
levier who close by did dwell, 
• 
A 
bandy backed rustic, and hump legged as well; 
Said he, " Fly with me, by the light of you star, 
For you are the eye of my apple, you are." 
SPOKEN— Ho 
was poor, but he was honest; and many an 
honest coat beats beneath a 
ragged heart, and he loved 
A sweet rustic damsel, etc. 
But this dutiful maiden said gently, " Be wise; 
My father would scratch out my nails with his eyes. 
If you love me you will not bring me to disgrace," 
Sobbed the maid as she buried her hands in her face. 
SPoKEN—It was an affecting scene, and the light of a 
cloud 
suddenly bursting from behind the moon, fully revealed the at-
titude of 
A sweet rustic damsel, etc. 
53 
So, as she refused him, he knocked down the maid, 
Then silently opened the knife of his blade; 
He next cut the throat of this damsel so fair, 
Then dragged her along by the head of her hair, 
SPOKEN— It was all her own hair; she never descended to 
false chignons, but she was dead now. 
Yes, her throat was 
cut from mouth to mouth, and the water rushed forth from the 
wound like blood. 
A sweet rustic damsel, etc. 
Just then her old father came up, it appears, 
And looked on this sad sight with eyes in his tears; 
He knelt by her side and her sweet face he kiss'd, 
Then rushed with his nose at the murderer's fist. 
SPOKES— Poor old man I He hqd put his head on his hat, 
and come out in search of his absent daughter. and had just 
stopped to strike his pipe against a 
match, when he saw the 
dead body of 
A charming little rustic, etc. 
With the knife the old man he an end to him put 
Then spurned with his body the murderer's foot; 
To commit suicide then his way he did wend, 
So that is the tale of a 
very sad end. 
SPOKEN—Poor old man 1 His was the fate to be lamented, 
cut off in the flower of his youth, 
In the bloom of womanhood 
she died. 
Her memory was short, but her life is still revered 
by those who knew 
A sweet rustic damsel, etc.

THE WATERMILL 
,leme • 
,X:F.mi,SL 
• 
As recited by Gus W ILLIAMS, at the Olympic Theatre. 
Listen to the watermi
- ll, through the livelong day, 
How the clicking of its wheel wears the hours away, 
Languidly the autumn wind :Airs the greenwood leaves, 
From the fields the reapers sing, binding up the sheaves; 
And a 
proverb haunts my mind, as a 
spell is cast— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Autumn winds revive no more leaves that once are shed, 
And . lie sickle cannot reap corn once gathered; 
And the rippling stream flows on, tranquil, deep and still. 
Never gliding back again to the watermill. 
Truly speaks the proverb old, with a 
meaning vast— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Take the lesson to thyself, loving heart and true, 
Golden years are fleeting by, youth is passing, too; 
Learn to make the 'nest of life, lose no happy day, 
Time will never bring thee back chances swept away. 
Leave no tender word unsaid, love, while love shall last— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Work while yet the daylight shines, man of strength and will. 
Never does the streamlet glide useless by the mill; 
Wait not till to-morrow's sun beams upon the way, 
All that thou canst call thine own lies in thy— to- day, 
Power, intellect and health may not always last— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Oh! the wasted hours of life that have drifted by, 
Oh! the good we might have done, lost without a 
sigh! 
Love that we might once have saved by a 
single word, 
Thoughts conceived, but never penned, perishing unheard, 
Take the proverb to thine heart, take and hold it fast— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Oh I 
love thy God and fellow-man, thyself consider last, 
For come it will, when thou must scan dark errors of the past; 
And when the fight of life is o'er, and earth recedes from view, 
And Heaven in all its glory shines, ' midst the pure, the good 
the true. 
Then you'll see more clearly the proverb deep and vast— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past.

Courting Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
`ee meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too difii. 
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse. to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unlady-like encourage-
ment. Ao a 
result of this dilemma, many 
lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties
