April 17, 2014, Mark Wagler talking with Diane Coccari in Madison, Wisconsin. 
Diane born May, 1951 in Danbury, Connecticut. She is half Italian, a quarter German and a 
quarter British. Did an undergraduate degree in Anthropology, a Masters in South Asian 
Studies, and a Ph.D. in South Asian Languages and Literature. Her focus was religion, 
Hinduism; the work was very anthropological. She has a 1-6 certification in teaching; was 
certified through a special program at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, called the Teach 
for Diversity program. It accepted people who were already down the road in terms of their 
own occupations; established in certain fields, who wanted to change directions and work in 
the public schools. [sound from handling microphone]  
All her teaching has been in Madison. Taught one year in the 4-year-old program, then was a 
student teacher in grades 1-5; she only taught one year in elementary in a 4th/5th grade class 
before she switched to 6th grade in middle school. She stayed at that level.  She had a terrible 
attitude toward teaching and teachers when she was an undergraduate; she looked down on 
those people and she was going to do something more interesting. As a graduate student, she 
began teaching as a TA and had her own classes and curriculum and really started loving it. It 
was interesting, challenging, rewarding. She also worked with another teacher, an Indian who 
was an old friend, who was an extraordinary teacher and role model. She taught that 
university class in Hindi for eight summers; would teach 2 ½ years of Hindi in 10 weeks which 
was quite amazing, and the quality of the students was extraordinary. 
00:04:59  
Also happening at the same time, Diane had her own children and got involved 
in their pre-school and early years of schooling. Diane saw that the diversity of Madison was 
increasing and she didn’t see that a lot of teachers were ready to address that diversity. She 
started working with her children’s preschool to create a diversity committee, to increase 
awareness of diversity, recruit neighbors and community members who might not be able to 
afford the preschool to be ready to come in, look at available resources. Continued this in 
their early elementary classes. Realized it was hard to be trying to influence people from the 
outside, decided she should get herself into the classroom. [sound from handling microphone] 
Didn’t want to spend many years in school, had already spent way too much time there so 
checked with the school of education; suddenly this special program opened. It was 18 
months, and streamlined all the requirements. 
00:08:25  
A typical day is hard to describe. Diane taught in so many configurations. For a 
few years, Diane had her own classroom and taught all subjects and was able to integrate to a 
great degree. Most of the time she taught with a partner and had 2 6th grade classes. Another 
part of the time she had two partners, so had up to 75 students and taught fewer subjects.

She can talk about the parts of the day that felt significant no matter what she was doing, 
because there were certain ways of approaching the day that were critical, no matter what. 
Diane found that greeting the students as they entered the classroom was one of the most 
important things she did, smiling, looking them in the eye and mentioning their names, taking 
the temperature of where they were. Sometimes she had to take interventions—perhaps by 
being silly for a few minutes or running around a tree outside and coming back or doing 
yoga—to help them learn in Diane’s class. It was also important to mix up the activities in any 
given period. Diane loves the larger blocs of time; could lengthen or shorten something as 
needed. [sound from handling microphone]  
The point is to always diversify the delivery of what you’re doing. Inevitably, there would be a 
launch (what we’re going to do today); a cooperative work period when Diane would circulate; 
then a period when you’d get people back together at their desks and everyone would process 
what they had learned. That was a common schedule for Diane, but she also liked working 
with different modalities for lots of different experiences: movies, music, food, research in 
different locations, different ways to present their work. 
00:13:50  
It was fundamental for Diane to build community in the classroom. She was 
trained in a certain approach, but got skillful at adding in different things. It’s a sequence: you 
have to get to know children and they have to get to know each other, especially deeply; they 
have to learn to work together, and then learn to work with greater degrees of challenge and 
complexity; learn about leaders and followers and what cooperation really looks like. That is 
Diane’s hallmark; she was very skillful at knowing what to do; for example, to see a dynamic 
and choose an activity that would forefront it so that everyone would see it, then process it 
and discuss what was going on and if that is what they wanted to have happen. It should be a 
minimum of the teacher talking; you should get it from the children. Looking to gain trust, 
both of the teacher and of the other students. That way, you’d have confidence that you could 
do harder stuff. As a teacher-mentor now, [sound from handling microphone] she sees 
teachers trying to be the students’ friend, and that was never what Diane shot for; she wanted 
them to feel safe and to trust her competence. Then eventually, the class could feel like a 
family and everyone could relax.  
00:19:25  
What has impacted your teaching? It’s always a compromise between who you 
are, what you want to do and what is mandated for you to do. It would be quite a different 
question if asked what would be an ideal teaching situation for you. As a public school 
teacher, she always had to deal with the realities of how the school was set up and what she 
was expected to do. She tried to interact positively with those expectations. In 6th grade, they 
were mandated to teach ancient civilizations; she would go about it in the way she wished to 
do it, coming out of her own knowledge and passions, and as importantly, who the children 
were. She would be sure to hit the standards she was supposed to hit, but she made sure the 
cultural areas would touch the lives of the children in the classroom. She made sure they 
began the year figuring out who they were, looking at their own backgrounds and histories. 
She had been in schools where it was clear the children didn’t know who each other were, and 
stereotyped each other and made very wrong assumptions about who was in the classroom.

Diane made sure students learned more than they knew before about their own backgrounds; 
a lot of the families appreciated that their children were coming home and asking, because 
often it was the first time they learned these family stories in detail. And then they would 
learn about each other and the other backgrounds in the classroom. For example, the children 
would create a scrapbook about their own family history. Diane decided she’d have these 
scrapbooks put together with black paper, and they would sew and bind it at the end; they 
could choose which aspects to put in the book. There would be photocopies of precious family 
photographs; they would do a family tree, many writing assignments and questions they could 
choose to answer such as the refugee experience, coming to America, interview family 
members, collect family stories, sometimes include maps, clippings and articles, actual objects 
from family members. It was quite open, with lots of ability to select what they wanted to put 
in. It went on for almost a month. 
00:26:41  
They would make posters too and then they would present what they made to 
the class and talk about it. Sometimes video, recordings, but always they would present their 
work. Diane feels it is very important for children to learn to present their work. Some kids 
were ready, others were shy, but Diane did what she needed to in order to help them present 
throughout the year. They would also talk along the way, of what they were getting and not 
getting. That helped the other students to stick with it and gave them ideas. The point was to 
talk with other students in the classroom about their backgrounds and who they were. Diane 
wanted her students to have real-world skill; she was always mediating between the world 
and the school. When she had her students learn anything, there were always several aspects 
addressed. They might be learning background about something, but Diane also wanted them 
to be learning skills, to become better learners, that they would always have. Then there were 
other skills, life skills—how to interview and talk to people, how to interact with people of 
different cultural backgrounds and ages; how to be appropriately assertive and how to ask 
questions. 
00:30:15  
Diane found diversity in every way when she was teaching middle school. When 
she started she had a naïve notion of ‘we are the world; diversity is great’ and real diversity in 
the classroom is fabulous, but much more difficult than when you have naïve notions. 
Diversity meant there were tremendous differences in where kids were at in terms of learning; 
from kids who had no English and didn’t know how to use scissors to kids with graduate level 
thinking skills and language in one classroom. She might have 7-8 different languages and 
culture groups in one class; kids who were refugees; kids living in poverty; different 
expectations for behavior; it was diverse in so many ways. It was doable and wonderful if you 
were skilled enough to make it all come together as a family and classroom. Diane had the 
freedom to explore and tweak things, and try new things; it was an incredible laboratory.  
Over the years she taught in middle school, it was interesting that different things came 
forward as larger challenges which changed and evolved. In early years, she struggled 
enormously with racial issues as the school became more racially mixed. Then that became 
less of a problem and she found herself dealing with bullying issues, including homophobia 
and treatment of kids with disabilities. Then she looked at her class one day and realized a 
Wisconsin Classroom Teachers 
 afc2013/017

third of her class was bi-racial, and realized ‘this has become different; we are all bi-racial in 
here.’ There was an evolution of what would come to the surface of what you’d be struggling 
with the most—not that there wouldn’t be times when you’d be struggling with all of it. 
 
00:35:20 
Little things would happen in the course of a year that would tell Diane that the 
class was “there.” In her last year of teaching, one time she was doing the processing portion 
of an activity; she gets very passionate and waves her hands and she knocked over a coffee 
cup full of pens and it broke but left it because she was so involved in what she was saying. 
Out of the corner of her eye, she saw a couple of kids get up, get the broom and dustpan and 
clean it up, and then sat back down. And at no point did they stop listening to Diane and 
looking at her while they were doing it. And then they sat down and were still listening. The 
focus was 100%. Later she thanked them. She realized, that at that moment the class had 
come together. [sound from handling microphone] It wasn’t always about Diane, it was about 
each other; they’d just hop up and do the right thing, help each other. They had become like a 
family and all the things that could divide them were things that they could manage. 
 
00:38:00  
Diane’s India stories and experiences were always something special for her 
students. She had depths of knowledge about that culture and could bring in a museum’s 
worth of stuff to the classroom, and have twelve stations and the kids could do everything—
masks, puppets, clothes, put henna on, learn Hindi, food, games—everything. Always very rich 
for the kids. She used her experience of living in India for so long, having to speak another 
language, being a minority in that culture; that is what motivated a lot of what she did and 
why she wanted to teach. She felt she had a special insight into students who came from other 
cultures and were struggling to live in our country. So even when she wasn’t explicitly telling 
Indian stories, her India experience informed her teaching. 
 
00:40:55  
Diane’s experience working with colleagues at the schools where she taught 
was profoundly mixed. She appreciated working with people who were diverse in terms of 
their own backgrounds and points of view. At the university, it’s a certain way of looking at the 
world. Diane felt she was out in the world with diverse people and backgrounds. She liked that 
on one hand, but on the other hand, you have to figure out who it is that you can work with, 
who philosophically is similar enough in their attitudes toward the students and education 
that you can collaborate with them. There were some wonderful people with whom to 
collaborate, but there were also people who made life miserable.  
 
One of the most painful aspects of working in a school was how you were treated by 
colleagues, administration and support staff. Diane felt there were two sets of people—one 
with whom she worked in her classroom, who came into the classroom (special ed people, 
English as a Second Language teachers or support people because Diane always had a lot of 
English language learners) and who she really appreciated; and the other set of people who 
never set foot in her classroom but felt threatened by Diane for some reason or another 
(perhaps because of her intensity, or disapproving of what she was teaching). One social 
worker told her she was breaking the law because she taught about Hinduism and Buddhism 
[sound from handling microphone]. If she did work with bullying issues, especially

 afc2013/017

homophobia, it would set some people off; teaching world religions set some people off. She 
felt that she was judged severely by people who really didn’t know what she was doing in her 
classroom. Once a music teacher stood outside her door when her class was doing cooperative 
games, and said “That is why Johnny can’t read” because the teacher was playing games. 
Diane had a rigorous curriculum, which she would put up against the curriculum of anyone in 
the school, but some still felt they could make a comment like that. 
 
00:46:00  
Diane did have some pushback from the community, if she was dealing with a 
topic like race; initially because she was still learning what she was doing and pushed some 
wrong buttons that upset parents. On the other hand, she would have community members 
and parents walk into her classroom and say “Oh my goodness!” because their children’s faces 
were everywhere, and their work, and art from different cultures, and for some people it was 
the first time they had ever seen that in a classroom. A lot of parents really appreciated the 
class investigations into family culture and background; others were angry and intimidated. 
For example, one African American boy was doing family history, and his parent kept calling 
Diane and screaming at her, “This is none of your business, who do you think you are? Where 
do you get off asking these private questions?” She might have two or three of these every 
year, even though she was very careful to say that there were other things that students could 
do, but they didn’t read the fine print, they just called. But she kept in dialogue with this 
parent and slowly the parent started realizing that Diane’s intentions were good. So this boy 
ended up doing his presentation a whole month after everyone else was done, but it took all 
that time to work with his family to get to the point where they felt they could risk sharing. 
But when he presented, he came in with a lot of stuff. And this is not an unusual experience. 
The experiences with the community and families was complicated and interesting, mixed. 
 
00:50:15  
Did Diane ever feel that other adults outside her school were colleagues in her 
classroom, or was it mostly colleagues from her school? If it was anyone, it was colleagues 
from her school. Were there efforts to build community among the teachers and staff?  In a 
school, you do all the usual things. One of the most powerful things was, early in her career, 
they all shared the same lunch period, so all the teachers at school would show up in the 
teacher’s lounge together, all grade levels. It was almost an accident of scheduling since they 
hadn’t become an overcrowded school yet, so the children could all eat together and the 
teachers all had free time at the same time [sound from handling microphone]. It profoundly 
helped them to get to know each other. When that changed, when they went to different 
breaks, they could never again create another opportunity to be together, laugh and relax.  
 
Over the next decade they tried to recreate this atmosphere, but never accomplished it. 
[sound from handling microphone] The culture of the school changed over the years. In 
general there were always people there that Diane trusted and loved and worked well with; 
and there were always people there that were toxic for Diane. There were always cliques that 
were toxic and she resisted joining them; the price of admission was gossip about other 
people and she resisted that. She always believed one should conduct oneself professionally 
at school, and that should be enough, but it wasn’t enough. By the end, Diane felt she

 afc2013/017

prevailed—that people understood that she was going to be professional, and be honest and 
be herself, and at the end she was well respected at that school. 
00:55:15  
What kinds of stories did teachers tell to each other at school? [sound from 
handling microphone] Far too many of the stories were complaining about other people, the 
administration, the families. Diane didn’t participate in that. She doesn’t recall teachers sitting 
around telling positive stories. The people she worked with, respected and enjoyed would talk 
about their shared responsibilities to students, but also about their lives, TV shows they 
enjoyed, shared interests in the community. Diane has always been concerned to express to 
people in the community who are not teachers that Madison is a very segregated city, and she 
believes most people really have no idea what’s going on in the lives of people who are not 
white middle-class people [sound from handling microphone]. People have no idea how 
diverse the schools have become and how challenging that is. She felt it was important to get 
the word out that people should go to their local schools because they had no idea. Now, we 
are hearing about the achievement gap and our segregation and who we are incarcerating—
this is coming out now. In her own home, because her husband is a teacher, there was a lot of 
venting about the challenges she faced in school, but with her own community of friends she 
shares a lot about how rewarding, positive and amazing these children and families are. 
00:59:50  
In the big picture, Diane has felt a great deal of satisfaction about her 
profession and her learning, her competence. She feels good that she learned to do a great job 
in facilitating the learning of children, especially such interesting children. But the other part is 
the relationships with the children themselves and their families. Diane might have 2-6 
children from the same family, so she’d see these families for decades and get to know them. 
She felt very identified with the community in which she taught, she felt it was her 
neighborhood and she understood it deeply. She’d be involved in the community centers, 
wider than just the school. Diane would have loved to have taught in a different kind of 
school—to have had teaching partners with whom she was completely in sync. There are 
those teachers in Madison, but Diane never had the opportunity to work with them.  
She would have loved to have worked in a more open school, that didn’t mandate so much, 
that had relationships with other institutions and places in the community, where they could 
have spent a lot of time going outside the school and had the openness to create a more 
integrated curriculum with great partners. Her school over time became prison-like; the doors 
are locked and there are cameras and guards. There are all kinds of ways to be a good teacher 
and make learning happen, and you have to do the best you can with what you have. She 
went outside the school as much as she could; a lot of that was her science curriculum and 
going out for group challenges, like low ropes, high ropes, school forest, caving—get outside 
for that sort of community building. She also had a series of fieldtrips that involved learning 
about wetlands and watersheds because her school was next to a beautiful marsh. They went 
out a series of seven times, walking to the wetland to experience every season and learn as 
much as they could. She would start with the bioregion quiz, asking kids what they know 
about where their water comes from and where it goes. She wasn’t able to do something 
comparable for culture, because in that period of time she had 75 students and the logistics of 
Wisconsin Classroom Teachers 
 afc2013/017 
6
that, and the student body was lower income, and she had to deal with teacher partners—
even going on all-day fieldtrips, you’re taking students out of three different classrooms in the 
afternoon. Diane didn’t always have teaching partners who were willing to give her that time. 
Logistically, those things were difficult. 
01:06:39  
What changes in teaching has she seen? The behaviors of the children who 
were outliers—a small percentage—determined how everyone had to behave. You’d get a 
proliferation of rules and tightening up of schedules. Everything is getting more repressed 
because of the behaviors of a few that weren’t being dealt with well. The idea of standards, 
testing, teaching to the test, the tightening up of curriculum—the panic over the achievement 
gap seems to be driving “teacher-proof” curricula. As she has said before, it has been stated 
that ‘we are not about the super-teachers, individuals with extraordinary backgrounds; we are 
about everybody being better teachers, so we’re going to lift all boats.’  Standardization. 
Teaching outside the mainstream became more difficult. Legalities got thrown in your face. It 
was harder to take kids out of the classroom. Diane used to have huge ethnic feasts, but was 
eventually told she couldn’t do that because of panic over allergies and legal stuff. Using that 
as a way to shut things down. Finally, at the end, she was told she couldn’t do certain things 
like go to the school forest because other teachers weren’t doing those things. They made it 
difficult with paperwork, legal permissions, money. 
01:10:15 
What does good teaching look like? It looks easy. It’s also a sound. It’s a buzz, a 
hum. It wouldn’t be silent. People would be engaged, busy. There would be movement and 
sound. It just looks easy, and it’s not about you being up there and being in charge. Instead, 
you are moving through the class as a facilitator. In the last few years, Diane has been a 
facilitator for classroom action research and a mentor for young teachers. As a teacher 
mentor, she has done a lot of training in facilitation and she keeps thinking that she wishes 
she had all that to begin with. She wishes there were fuller, richer ways that teachers could 
engage in a reflective process from the word ‘go.’ That it was part of the institution of 
teaching to provide for expert facilitation and time away to reflect with your colleagues from 
the first day.  
Not everyone avails themselves of classroom action research or the Courage to Teach 
program; not everyone avails themselves of the time to reflect, and it is so valuable. She has 
been doing that reflection more at the end of her teaching and recently, and it has been very 
valuable. That is what she would want for education. Diane sees classroom action research 
and Courage to Teach as related, although Courage to Teach is deeper because it is longer. She 
really believes we teach who we are, and we should nurture teachers as human beings, to 
reflect on their humanity but also on how that relates to teaching. Everyone should be 
supported in having time off to get away and engage in a reflective process, when they are 
ready. A series of retreats would be best. With classroom action research, in the times when 
they were out of the building and in a lovely setting and valued as teachers, it really helped 
support them. Part of that is having a brilliantly facilitated process which helps you articulate 
your issues in teaching and how you can go forward from that point in a positive way. Diane 
has a lot of concerns about where education is going, with the movement toward 
Wisconsin Classroom Teachers 
 afc2013/017 
7
standardization and making things teacher-proof, it’s missing some of the central realities of 
teaching. You can raise up the bottom, but you won’t have brilliance and excellence in 
teaching if you don’t nurture the whole person who will then nurture the human beings in the 
classroom. Diane doesn’t know if she still has impact on the direction of education. [Mark’s 
cell phone rings; Diane laughs].
