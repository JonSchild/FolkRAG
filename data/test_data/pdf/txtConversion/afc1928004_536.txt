MY ELDEST DAUGHTER °TARA, 
Copyrighted by A. J. Fisher, 1880. 
Written by James Richmond for Pat Rooney and sung 
by him with great success. 
Sure I 
have a 
lovely daughte 
On the stage she cuts a 
dash, 
She wears blonde wigs and powders her face, 
To try and catch a 
mash. 
She can dance a 
tailor's hornpipe, 
She tells the old woman that she is fine, 
She wears flesh colored pants when sh.t comes 
out to dance, 
And gets drunk on German wine. 
She wears dizzy diamonds and wings on her back, [ break. 
In the ballet dance she is like a 
jumping jack, [break. 
She has a 
barrel of paint on her face, 
Like a 
fairy from Conamarra, 
The pride of the McCormick family, 
Is my eldest daughter Clara. 
You should see her in the can-can, 
She is the dead picture of her ma, 
She has a 
foot as big as a 
telegraph pole, 
Her features are like her pa. 
She has all the swells near crazy, 
An engagement for life she has signed, 
of, 
She is hitched to a 
man named Freddie McCan, 
He has a 
million dollars in his mind,

Cheese It, Jimmie, Cheese It. 
Written by Edwin Talbot, and sung with great success by 
Pat Rooney. 
AIR—Bogie Man. 
The boys hanging around the public baths, 
How patiently they wait, 
The policeman tries to keep them quiet, 
And pass them in the gate, 
They push and pull to sneak in twice, 
And get another swim, 
But the copper drops and tells them, 
Young fellow that's too thin. 
CHORUS. 
Then cheese it, Jimmy, cheese it, 
Now lay bones for your chance, 
Don't you see the copper will sneak, 
And slug in the pants. 
Then cheese it, Petey, cheese it, 
I 
tell you he will drop, 
Now go and dry your hair now quick, 
Now sherry here is the cop. 
They put seventeen boys in a 
little room, 
About as big as a 
dry goods box, 
You'll hear them say, my 
clothes is wet, 
I 
wonder where is rocks, 
They put on their shoes upon the dock, 
Buy a 
bolivar if the've got tin, 
Then dry up their hair and watch the police. 
And worl the bath again, 
I( r

Then they Chase the Landlord from the Door. 
Written by Edwin Talbot for Pat Rooney and sung by him 
with great success. 
AIR—" Never take the horseshoe from the Door," as sung 
by Harrigan & hart. 
Every month the rent is handed to the landlord, 
In the tenement house, where the families congregate, 
Then 3Irs. Duffy says that Mrs. Reilly's daughter, 
In the sink threw dirty cabbage and corn mate. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, then they get a 
drinking and a 
slugging, 
It's worse than listening to the Pinafore, 
But when Kelly throws ashes at Terry Monaghans mother, 
Arrah, it's then then they chase the landlord from the 
door. 
Mrs. McNally had sixteen shirts upon a 
clothes line, 
And a 
brand new suit of dresses from the store, 
Young Kelly's son he stole them and he pawned then), 
You can bet she chased the young kid from the door. 
Last night her daughter Mary Ann the speeler, 
Was standing with a 
young man she met before, 
Some one dropped out a 
scuttle full of cinders, 
To chase the dizzy lovers from the door, 
The milk is left up in the hallway every morning, 
From Jacob McCarthy's german grocery store, 
When he tries to collect his bill they give him warning, 
And chase the poor old milkman from the door. 
When Muldoon is President 
Written by JAS. RICHMOND for PAT ROONEY. 
Copyrighted by A. J. FISHER, 1879. 
You've heard of McCormick, the politician 
But I 
am the man that's wide awake; 
I 
can speak as long as O'Leary can walk, 
And for grammar I 
take the cake, 
I 
was seventeen years a 
Congressman, 
And in the Treasury I 
made a 
big dent; 
I'll have no trade dollars, but all iron money, 
When Muldoon is your President. 
CHORUS. 
I'll give every bootblack a 
brown stone front, 
And the laboring man free rent; 
I'll make politicians walk on their hands to save then shoes 
When Muldoon is your President. 
-PH have iron railings around New York, 
I'll build a 
railroad across the sea ; 
I'll move Central Park to Washington, 
You can ride to California free. 
I'll tear down all the Elevated roads; 
No more Governors will be my intent; 
I'll have steamboats running by telegraph 
When Muldoon is your President. 
I'll give every bootblack, &c. 
McCluskey, the Politician. 
As sung by PAT ROONEY. 
Copyrighted by A. J. FISHER, 1879. 
I'm a 
man that's known both far and near, 
McCluskey that's my name, 
An all the politicians, sure, 
Are envious of my fame; 
I 
got a 
grip in the auld Sixth Ward, 
And ye bet I 
make it pay, 
An' I 
hould a 
high position 
Upon Election Day. 
CHORUS. 
As I 
walk through the ward, 
As proud as a 
lord, 
The gang rise their hats and cry out, " Clear 
the way." 
Oh for style an' for air, 
There is none to compare 
Wid McCluskey on Election Day. 
It was on last election time, 
I 
ran for Alderman, 
My political antagonist 
Was a 
loafer named McCann; 
But I 
trated all the boys I 
met, 
From Harlem to Cow Bay, 
And they said they'd vote nine times for me 
Upon Election Day. 
As I 
walk, &c. 
Election time came quickly round, 
I 
wint to make a 
speech, 
But the gang they knocked theiplatform down, 
And I 
loud for help did screech. 
Now although I 
didn't get the place, 
Just listen to what I'll say, 
I'll play them all for suckers 
On next Election Day. 
As I 
walk, &c,

O'REILY, YOU'RE N. G. 
[Copyright Secured, 1875, by Per ItooNEy.] 
%thug with great success at the Olympic Theatre, N 
Written by HAMM BEIMTT 
rind friends if you will listen now, 
My woes I'll now tell you; 
Iy heart is nearly broken, 
And I 
don't know what to do; 
No matter where I 
chance to go, 
Nor wherever I 
may be, 
The blackguards cry as I 
pass by, 
O'Reily, you're N. G. 
If I 
go into a 
tavern, 
And call out for a 
boos, 
The gang says I 
must treat them 
Or their frendship I 
will lose ; 
And if I 
do refuse them, 
Their heads they shake at ma, 
And sing out Philadelphia--
O'Reily, you are N. G. 
It was just before election 
I 
was called to make a 
speech, 
For a 
friend of mine, 
Whose name was Thomas Lich; 
The gang was there, I 
do declare, 
And when I 
did begin, 
They said, for God's sake, fire him out! 
Where did he get his wind ? 
I 
couldn't speak a 
word at all. 
9 
They made such a 
terrible noise; 
And all at once I 
felt a 
brick 
Hit me between the eyes, 
And through the door I 
fled, for sure; 
Sure they meant to murder me, 
And when I 
was outside 
I 
heard them cry, 
O'Reily, you are N. G. 
The slang the gang is using now, 
You'll hear from every lip ; 
Its shoot the hat! and get it boiled, 
And don't you lose your grip! 
They say I'm too fresh, and too bran new., 
And will I 
ever drop, and stag his nips, 
And skip the gutter, and hit him with a 
7 v. 
The children there are using the slang, 
As well as every one. 
They'll say to me, go take a 
bath! 
And why don't I 
take a 
run ? 
And then they'll say, 
Go stop the coat, so long as Tra la la lee! 
But the worst of all 
Is when they bawl-
0! Rooney, you're N. G.

Little Nellie O'Brien. 
'Written and composed by G. E. Hanson, with A. J. Fisher. 
Music by John E. Murphy, of Murphy & Mack, and sung 
by him with great success. 
I 
came to tell you I 
am in love, 
With a 
girl lives on a 
farm, 
She feeds the pigs, does Irish jigs, 
And possesses a 
lovely charm. 
Her teeth are like the snow so white, 
She is the prettiest girl for miles, 
Her hair it hangs, she wears no bangs, 
And her face is covered with smiles. 
CHORUS. 
For she is the maid that I 
adore, 
I 
am sure I'd call her mine, 
For I 
know that I 
would surely die, 
Without little Nellie O'Brien. 
She is as pure and innocent as a 
lamb, 
Her face I 
can't forget, 
She is her mother's only joy, 
And her father's little pet. 
I've proposed and she has accepted, 
Soon I 
will take her hand, 
The twelfth of May is our wedaing day, 
Then we'll join the matrimonial band. 
Chorus.

Jerry Slattery. 
As sung by PAT ROONEY, 
Copyrighted by A. J. FISHER, an. 
Jerry Slattery was a 
tailor, he was ninety years of age, 
He had a 
son named Micky, a 
play actor on the stage. 
He'd play Romeo with his sister, for diamonds he'd give her 
pork and beans, 
Then little Michael Slattery would tear the bedclothes up for 
scenes. 
He is crazy, he is lazy, he broke his leg last week, 
He is always singing, always dancing, and playing tragedy in 
his sleep. 
He is,idways talking of Mary Anderson, he'd support her on 
the stage, 
Sure last night he got so crazy, we had to put him in a 
cage. 
CHORUS. 
Then it's little Michael Slattery stole his father's pants, 
He cut them up for tights to do a 
song and dance; 
When his mother was asleep he cut her hair off for a 
wig, 
Now little Micky Slattery is doing an acrobatic jig. 
He cut off his father's whiskers to play Hamlet and King Lear, 
Took a 
shot gun to his mother and made her walk off on her ear, 
He learned his sister dancing, cut off eleven of her toes, 
Now little Micky Slattery is singing tenor through his nose. 
For he's dramatic, he's lunatic, he is clean gone off his base, 
His father and his mother say he is a 
Celebrated Case, 
He says he takes the cake, as an actor he beats them all, 
Next week he plays Julius Caesar down at Solomon Duff's 
hall. 
Then it's little, &c.

As sung by PAT ROONEY, at the Olympic Theatre, 
In these now hard, uncertain times, 
They do things very queer; 
If you hav'nt got the ready cash, 
You cannot get your beer; 
The man behind the bar will say, 
Just by way of a 
joke— 
He'll shake his head with a 
meaning smile— 
You know the slate is broke. 
CHORUS. 
You're welcome in, to spend your tin, 
To have a 
drink or smoke; 
But you'd better put the money up, 
For you know the slate is broke. 
When you're daily labor is ended, 
And to walk you feel inclined; 
As you pass along the busy street, 
flow many friends you'll find ; 
They'll say to you, come and take a 
drink-. 
You'll return it with a 
smoke ; 
But you'd better put the money up, 
For you know the slate is broke. 
You're welcome, &c.

Oh, ladies and gentlemen, I 
now tell to ye 
About a 
young man named Oscar Magee; 
He had cast-iron teeth, and he never eat hash, 
When his money was all spent he had to pawn his moustache. 
He had a 
brother named DeWitt, in Brooklyn he did preach, 
He married old Corbin down at Manhattan Beach; 
He married them in a 
cellar, he must have been in a 
trance, 
The wedding present was a 
cast-iron overcoat and a 
wooden 
pair of pants. 
He bought a 
gold mine in Hoboken, and he found nothing 
but rocks; 
He went crazy and mad and cut his throat—with a 
pair 
of socks. 
He was found guilty of arson and stealing twenty gold rings, 
Then he was taken 
to a 
coal yard, and hung by the 
shoe strings. 
Moloney You're Led Astray. 
Written by Joim F. 
ADAMS, and sung by PAT ROONEY. 
Copyrighted by A. J. FISHER, 1879. 
My name is Mike Moloney, 
In the Fourth Ward I 
dwell, 
I 
just came here to-night 
My story for to tell. 
It's about a 
gang of roughs, 
I 
see them every day, 
When I 
go out sure they all shout, 
"I'm told you're led astray." 
CHORUS. 
They say go back to Ireland. 
And there forever stay, 
If you want to lead an honorable life, 
And not be lead astray. 
I 
got an invitation 
To attend a 
ball the other day, 
It was given by Mrs. McNally, 
Who resides across the way. 
As I 
ascended up the stairs, 
I 
heard some one say, 
" 
Here comes Moloney, let's put him back; 
Or he'll be led astray." 
They say go back, &c. 
I 
determined to go to that ball, 
Let the boys do what they may. 
So I 
went up on the landing, 
And for a 
moment there did stay. 
When they knocked me down with pillows. 
And thete they let me lay, 
MOLONEY YOU'RE LED ASTRAY. 
Continued. 
As they walked out I 
heard them shout, 
"Moloney, you've been led astray." 
They say go back, &c. 
I 
picked myself up and followed them, 
Just as quick as ever I 
could, 
But when I 
got out stile they were gone, 
So it didn't do me any good. 
I 
went to Mrs. McNally's room, 
When to me she this did say. 
"We have no ball, so I 
must confess 
That you've been led astray." 
CHORUS. 
Says I 
I'll go back to Ireland, 
And there forever I 
stay, 
For if I 
stop in America, 
I 
surely will be led astray, 
Encore. 
My Henry is a 
preacher 
In a 
great big Brooklyn church, 
With twenty thousand dollars every year. 
He plays possum with the ladies, 
And leaves them in the lurch, 
And the congregation all fed very queer. 
CHORUS. 
He's a 
lady killer, he's a 
hypocrite, 
He is like a 
Turk in war without a 
spear; 
He has had more fun than any son of a 
gun, 
And can kick as high as any Texas steer.

Murphy's Great Walk. 
Written by JAS. RICHMOND for, and sung by, PAT ROONEY. 
Copyrighted by A. J. FISHER, 1879. 
Arrah, my name is Isaac Murphy, 
And 
have ye all to know 
That I 
was born in China, 
Near the county of Mayo. 
I 
can walk six months and never stop, 
I 
can run faster than a 
train ; 
Faith, I 
am soon going over to England, 
To bring the belt Rowell took back again. 
CHORUS. 
I'll walk the first hundtpd miles on my head, 
The second on my toes; 
The third I'll walk on my eye-brows, 
And the fourth upon my nose. 
The fifth and last I'll walk on my ear, 
Then the Atlantic I 
walk across, 
Sure the Philadelphia Bladder says, 
Of all walkers I 
am the boss. 
I 
can walk from here to Australia and back 
In about three days and a 
half, 
Or around the world in a 
hundred hours— 
When I 
told O'Leary he gave me the laugh. 
I 
can walk for a 
year without any sleep, 
And keep waltzing around on the track; 
It would take me ninety minutes, just, 
To walk from here to Germany and back. 
I'll walk the first hundred, &c.

Katie Dear. 
As sung by PAT Roosrm 
Copyrighted by A. J. FISHER, 1879. 
My Katie dear, my Katie dear, 
It's her I'm going for to see; 
I'm going to take her to a 
dance to-night, 
And it's happy we will be, 
She's not very stout, she's not very thin, 
But I 
want you all to understand, 
To sing a 
song or dance a 
jig 
She can beat all the girls in the land. 
17 
CHORUS. • 
She can sing, (gym.) 
She can sing, ( Sym.) 
She's my Irish colleen everybody knows. 
Arrah, whenever a 
fiddle begins to play 
Now this is the way she goes— (Dance.) 
My Katie dear, my little Katie dear, 
We're going to be married soon; 
I 
feel so happy, boys and girls, 
And as proud as the richest gossoon. 
And when we settle down in — here, 
All the people in the town we'll invite. 
You can bet your dime we'll have a 
good time, 
We'll not go home till broad daylight. 
CHORUS. 
We will sing, (Sym.) 
We will dance, (Sym.) 
We'll have a 
good time, now remember, sure, 
And when old Murphy squeezes the pipes, 
It's then we'll welt the floor.

Copyright, 1878, by A. J. FISHER. 
My name it is McGinty, yes, 
I 
live on ham and flour, 
With O'Leary, the walker, I 
came here, 
For to walk a 
mile an hour, 
About half past twelve o'clock last night 
A 
gang gave me a 
terrible fright, 
They woke me up and set me tight, 
For to walk against O'Leary. 
They took me to a 
great big field, 
And with alcohol set me crazy, 
They stripped me clothes off to the skin, 
And rt made me feel so lazy; 
It was then the gang commenced to talk, 
Saying who is the terrier going to walk, 
And they said they would hang me if I'd bauic 
When I 
walked against O'Leary. 
The first mile I 
walked my legs were weak, 
And the gang commenced to holler, 
They sprinkled salt upon the track 
And hit me with an iron dolkir. 
All the other walkers were ahoad, 
Eating sponge cake, pie and bread, 
0 
heavens, I 
wish that I 
was dead, 
When I 
walked against O'Leary. 
I 
walked until I 
catched the cramps, 
Around and around the track, 
All the ladies threw bouquets at me, 
There was a 
corn upon my back; 
The judge told me it was time to stop 
As around the track like a 
chicken I'd flop, 
For the want of a 
whiskey I 
t ()ugh I'd drop, 
The day I 
walkad aphist O'Leary.

When I

It was in McCann's back room, 
That night they nominated me; 
I 
axed the boys to have a 
drink, 
As they gave me three times three; 
They drank and smoked, they smoked awl drank, 
'Till drunk was every man; 
'Twits all at the expense 
Of poor Pat Duffle, the Alderman. 
'Twas in the. &c. 
But when election day it came, 
I

The boys had all gone back on me, 
And were voting for Muldoon; 
And when I

To laugh, they all began— 
Saying, we don't want no Turner, 
For to be our Alderman.

Since Mary Ann learned kow to dance, 
I

She's out all night ' till broad daylight, 
A

On every moonlight pie-the sure my daughter can be found, 
And when I 
bid her stay at home she says, Go feel around ;" 
And on starlight excursions, where the band plays Flewy-

'Tis there I'll find my Mary Ann a

When I

By a

He says, " What's your name ?" says I " Tim Flaherty!'

He showed me around, the sights were soon found, 
I 
viewed them with wonder and astonishment: 
When he bade me good-bye, tears came in my eye, 
I 
found he'd been through me, and took iv'ry cint, 
What to do I 
didn't know, where was I

So I 
wint to the Coort, and explained to the Judge. 
He called me a 
pauper, a 
vagrant and loafer, 
And gave me six months in the Island above. 
I'm Tim Flaherty, &c. 
So I 
shouldered my bundle, and homeward I 
wandered; 
Ould Erin forever, oh, she is my joy! 
It's here I'm at home, and never will roam, 
For she's good enough for a 
rale Irish boy. 
Sure, there's whiskey galore, just here by the door. 
And beauties you ne'er can find afar o'er the say 
And the girls are so pretty, so nate and so witty, 
And that's just what suits the lad, Tim Flaherty.

So nimbly I 
could shake my feet; 
They never found me slow or lazy, 
At jigging I 
could not be beat.

All played-out and indigent Bummers, having become un-

I 
LEFT IRELAND AND MY MOTHER BE-
CAUSE WE WERE POOR, 
Written for and Sung by Andy and Annie Hughes. 
(Copyright, by ANDY HUGHES.) 
There's a 
sweet spot in Ireland, that I 
long to see, 
It's my own native birth-place, and its heaven to me, 
Where my blessed old mother lived there all alone; 
With my brothers and sisters ' twas a 
bright happy home, 
We had'nt much money, but my old mother dear, 
Left a 
kiss on my brow and bade me heart have good cheer, 
And the shadows of poverty crossed on our door, 
I 
left Ireland and my mother, because we were poor. 
I 
will never forget on that bright rosy morn, 
When old Ireland I 
left, how my poor heart did mourn, 
And my aged old mother said, be of good cheer, 
Farewell, farewell, Danny darling, good-bye. 
Mother and my brothers and sisters, took me by the hand, 
And bade me do right, when I 
left Ireland, 
And I 
bade them farewell, at our own cottage door: • 
And left Ireland and my mother, because we were poor. 
Now, since leaving old Ireland, my poor mother is dead. 
God bless my dear son, were the last words she said ? 
And the ring that me father gave, she sent to me, 
It's a 
far dearer gem, than bright gold ere could be, 
But my brothers and sisters, sure I 
wish they were here, 
For I'm longing to see them, hut they'll come never fear, 
We'll make a 
fine home on America's shore, 
Where happy we'll live, yes, although we be poor.

THE DONKEY. 
Written. by Edwin Talbot, and sung by Murphy & Mack, 
An Irishman, as you can see, 
I'm known both far and wide. 
since I've been in this country 
I 
have been the people's pride, 
When first I 
landed in New York 
It filled me with conceit, 
The kids say, " Murph, for digging turf, 
You have the real elegant feet. 
CHORUS— 
For the other day I 
heard them say 
That me nose looked like a 
beet, 
Then all the gang with vulgar slang. 
Roared, Murphy, anchor yer feet. 
My Delia Clancy, that's the girl I 
love, 
Sure I 
called on her the other night, 
And swore by all the clouds above. 
For there was none out that night, 
Says I, " My darling charming Delia, 
My heart is yours complete." 
Says she, " I 
won't have any funny business, 
Oh, Murphy, anchor yer feet." 
Chorus. 
Sure it's President they say I'd be, 
If it wasn't for this hullabaloo. 
If my head was only the size of my feet., 
And of course that's very true. 
You might know I'm a 
prominent man, 
For every one I 
meet as I 
stroll along, 
You'll hear the gang shout, " Holloa, 
Murphy, anchor yer feet."

I'VE got a 
donkey, he stands six foot high, 
I'll sell to the man that wishes to buy. 
He drinks Seltzer Water whenever he's dry, 
In a 
race on the turf he has never proved shy ; 
Ile makes good time—about one mile a

He fought for his country, he's bee. through the war;

I've got a 
donkey, he's not very chunky, 
I'll trade for a 
monkey, to any old flunkey, 
Now wouldn't that be hunky, if he had my donkey, 
And I 
had his monkey, my donkey also ? 
If he's locked in the stable he'll make a 
stiff kick; 
If he wants to get out he'll pretend he is sick; 
I 
call out my donkey—his name it is Dick. 
I 
coax him along with a 
hickory stick. 
If I 
leave in his box a 
big bale of hay, 
he'll eat it all up and leave none for next day. 
Last week he broke loose, and he got astray; 
He was found in a 
sewer in Avenue A. 
I've got a 
donkey, 
I 
harnessed him up last St. Patrick's day, 
I 
rode on his back so cheerful and gay, 
We started from the corner of Tenth and Broadway, 
We rode to the hall, without any delay. 
Just as we were passing by Central Park, 
A 
boy fired a 
pistol off, just for a 
lark, 
The donkey fell down, which caused a 
blockade 
Only for fifty horse- doctors he'd spoil the parade.

Words and music 
Sung with great success by

It's very strange indeed to me, that go where'er I 
may, 
So many queer remarks I 
hear about me every clay ; 
'Twas but last night upon the street, my style the boys did quiz, 
And one says " You can have it pards, if you guess what it is !" 
SPOKEN—As 
soon as they saw me they shouted, " Here it 
comes !" and as I 
approach they all began to sing— 
CHORUS. 
What is it ? heavens what is it ? 
Does it live do you know ? or is it a 
chromo ? 
Did it blow out, or did it grow out ? 
Oh ! for heaven's sake, what is it ? 
'Twas in the Park, a 
lively mob at me did talk and stare. 
" I 
wonder if it's loaded, and if that's all its own hair," 
"It lives, it breathes," one chap did say, its pulse is all serene. 
Approaching me " Old Krank," says he, " I'll see that you're 
kept green! 
SPOKEN—Yes, and when I 
say a 
word back, they shout, 
" 
Look out for it, it's teethin' !" and then again comes the 
conundrum 
What is it, & c. 
They asked how long I 
walked alone, and say " when were 
you canned ?" 
And hint I'd look much better if upon my head I'd stand; 
And as around the Square I 
walk, with gloves and cane and 
pipe , 
I 
heard them whisper everywhere, " I 
wonder if it's ripe !" 
SPOKEN—Yes, they want 
t

One I

Bonnets and ribbons she does sell ; 
On the Bowery she owns a

She has " Milliner " on the door, 
And Augustine Delia Clancey that's the belle. 
Shure it's every Sunday night, 
It is my heart's delight 
To go up Miss Clancey for to see. 
A 
grand piano she plays so fine, 
To me she is divine, 
And all those lovely songs she sings to me. 
CHORUS. 
She sings, she sings Sweet Bye and Eye, 
And go to sleep my Baby Mine. 
She sings, she sings such pretty tunes, 
The girl I 
love I'll marry soon. 
There is Owen Smith and Grady, 
The Misses Scott and Doyle, 
Sitting in the parlor all so fine. 
Sure Smithy has comical talk, 
And such a 
funny walk, 
Which causes all the party for to smile. 
When Miss Clancey does appear 
Such curious things you'll hear, 
" 
Miss Clancey, dear, you're looking all serene," 
She smiles and bows her head, 
To the piano she lightly treads, 
And all those loyely songs she sings to me.

Saying: Good-bye, my boys, to that dear old land, we ne'er 
may see it more, 
For we're going to tight both day and night, all for that sham-
rock shore. 
Then hurrah, itc. 
We sailed away from Dublin quay, and ne'er received a 
shock, 
Until we landed in New York, long side of the dock, 
Where thousands of Gur countrymen that were all in that town 
And ' Fagh a 
ballagh clear the track I" were the words titai 
passed all round. 
Then hurrah, & c. 
Then away we went in merriment to drink bourbon and wine, 
Each lad he gave his favorite toast for the girl he left behind; 
We sat and sang, made the ale-house ring, despising Erin's foes, 
Or any 1111111 tint hates the land, where St. Patrick's shamrock 
grows. 
Then hurrah, &c. 
Nancy Green.

In a 
little cot not far from here 
There lives the girl I 
love, 
To me she is as beautiful 
As the stars that shine above. 
Nancy Green that is her name, 
Her parents they like me, 
And every Sunday afternoon 
Miss Nancy I 
go to see. 
CHORUS. 
Pretty little Nancy will you love me ? 
For you know I 
love you, Nancy Green, 
I 
will love you in the morning and the evening, 
If you will only wed me, Nancy Green. 
'Twas in among the sweet grape vine 
Where first I 
met Miss Nance, 
The little birds sang sweetly, 
My heart was in a 
trance. 
I 
asked her for to marry me, 
She did not answer no, 
And on nextOunday afternoon 
We both to the church will go. 
Pretty little Nancy, &c.

The tallow dips in beauty, 
Shine bright upon the scene 
Of pleasant gay commotion, 
As grand as ever seen ; 
A 
kitchen full of dancers, 
In a 
famous frisky rout, 
Who lift the very roof itself, 
A,Vith this mysterious shout. 
CHORUS— 
Rise it, Reilly! all the jolly dancers sing out, 
Rise it, Reilly! show your power and motion, 
Looney now they fly about, lazy feet had better g'out, 
When in the chorus wild they shout: Rise it, Reilly! 
'Tis they who never weaken, 
They'd scorn to lave the flure, 
Their feet have vowed that never 
They'd make a 
record poor; 
The " Rocky Road " is startin', 
A 
tune they love so well, 
'Tis now the ruction boomin' grows, 
As wildly still they yell. 
Chorus. 
A few nate words of blarney, 
To some bright buxom lass, 
A few clean swigs of poteen, 
Widout the aid of glass, 
And soon the shrieks of music, 
Their notes a 
warning ring, 
When up and at once again, 
They dance and wildly sing.

For I came from Tiperary, 
So far beyant the seas. 
CHORUS. 
For I'm just over, just over, 
Just over from the old Country, 
Just over, just over, but I'll soon go back again. 
But now I'm going to leave ye, 
I'm going far away, 
I'm going to leave the land I 
love, 
That's dear America, 
I 
am going back to my birth- place, 
In that little Isle so green, 
The home of all true Irish, 
And the best place that I've seen, 
Cnonus. 
For I'm just over, just over, 
Just over from the old Country, 
Just over, just over, but I'll soon go baelL again.

Good Bye Polly. 
Sung with great success by EDWIN BARRY at the Theatre Comique, 
I 
loved a 
girl named Polly, and thought that she loved me, 
So joined a 
ship to take a 
trip across the briny sea, 
And when the morning had arrived for me to sail away, 
I 
gave the lass a 
parting kiss, and then to her did say: 
CHORUS. 
Good bye Polly, I 
must leave you, 
Let us hope the parting will not grieve you, 
The ship it sails to-day, some thousand miles away; 
So think of me when I 
am on the sea. 
She vowed that she'd be true to me while I 
was away, 
And thinking what she said was right, I 
left her my half pay; 
Then with a 
sigh bid her good-bye, and as they heaved the lead, 
I 
left her standing on the shore, then jumped aboard and said: 
Good bye, Polly, & c. 
I 
saw her in my dreams at night, I 
thought of her all day, 
But did not think that she was false to me, when far away ; 
For I 
must own when I 
alone, was lying on my bed, 
I 
often woke up in a 
fright, and these words have said: 
Good bye, Polly, &c. 
Some years had passed when I 
returned, with lots of gold 
in store, 
And just you fancy my surprise, when I 
knocked at. the door. 
They told me Poll was married, she had been false to me, 
So now no more I'll stay on shore, I'm off again to sea. 
Good bye, Polly, &c.

CUMBERLAND'S CREW. 
Sung with great success by Devlin & Tracy. 
Oh ! shipmates, come, gather and join in my ditty, 
It's of a 
terrible battle that happened of late; 
Let each good Union-Tar shed a 
sad tear of pity, 
When he thinks of the once gallant Cumberland's fate. 
The eighth day of March told a 
terrible story, 
And many a 
brave tar to this world bid Adieu ! 
Yet our Flag it was wrapt in a 
mantle of glory, 
fly the heroic deeds of the Cumberland's crew. 
On that ill-fated day about ten in the morning, 
The sky it was clear, and bright shone the sun; 
The drums of the Cumberland sounded a 
warning 
That told every seaman to stand by his gun. 
An Iron-clad Frigate clown on us"came bearing, 
And high in the air the Rebel Flag flew; 
The Pennant of Treason she proudly was waving, 
Determined to conquer the Cumberland's crew. 
Then up spoke our Captain with stern resolution, 
Saying: my boys, of this monster now don't be dismayed, 
We swore to maintain our beloved Constitution, 
And to die for our country we are not afraid! 
We fight for the Union, our cause it is glorious, 
To the Stars and Stripes we will stand ever true; 
We'll sink at our quarters, or conquer victorious! 
Was answered,with cheers,from the Cumberland's crew. 
Now our gallant ship fired her guns' dreadful thunder, 
Her broad-side, like hail, on the Rebel did pour. 
The people gazed on, struck with terror and wonder, 
The shots struck her sides and glanced harmless o'er; 
51 
CUMBERLANDIS CREW.—Continued. 
But the pride of our Navy could never be daunted, 
Tho' the dead and the wounded her deck they did strew; 
And the Flag of the Union, how proudly it flaunted, 
Sustained by the blood of the Cumberland's crew, 
Slowly they sunk beneath Virginia's waters, 
Their voices on earth will ne'er be heard more— 
They'll be wept by Columbia's brave sons and fair daughters 
May their blood be avenged on Virginia's shore !— 
In that battle stained grave they are silently lying— 
Their souls have forever to earth bid Adieu !— 
But the Star-Spangled Banner above them is flying, 
It was nailed to the mast by the Cumberland's crew. 
They fought us three hours, with stern resolution, 
Till those Rebels found cannon would never avail them; 
For the Flag of Secession has no power to gall them, 
Tho' the blood from their scuppers it crimsoned the tide; 
She struck us amid- ship, our planks she did sever, 
Her sharp iron-prong pierced our noble ship through ; 
And still, as they sank on that dark rolling river, 
We'll die at our guns! cried the Cumberland's crew. 
Columbia's sweet birth-right of Freedom's communion, 
Thy Flag never floated so proudly before; 
For the spirits of those that died for our Union, 
Above its broad folds now exaltingly soar !— 
And when our sailors in battle assemble, 
God bless our clear Banner: the Red, 'White and Blue ! 
Beneath its bright Stars we'll cause tyrants to tremble, 
Or sink at our guns, like the Cumberland's crew.

THE IRISH BOY'S LAMENT. 
Written and sung by JOHNNY ROACH, the successful Irish Vocalist. 
FAREWELL, IreIhnd, I 
can no longer dwell at home, I 
must 
cross the stormy main, 
Where cruel strife may end my life, to see you ne'er again, 
It will break my heart from you to part, astore acushala machroe. 
But I 
must go full of grief and woe, to the shores of America. 
CHORUS. 
So now farewell, I 
can no longer dwell 
At home, acusliala machree, 
But I 
must go, full of grief and woe, 
To the shorea of America. 
On the Irish soil my fathers lived since the days of Erin Rano°, 
They paid their rent and lived content, convenient to KilNew, 
But a 
landlord cruel gave us the shuel, my poor old mother and 
me, 
We had to leave our home, far away to roam, and come to 
America. 
So now, & c. 
No more in the old churchyard, astore, on my father's grave 
shall I 
kneel, 
But the tyrant knows, but little of the woes, that a 
poor boy 
has to feel; 
58: 
When I 
look around, on that little spot of ground, where the 
cabin used to be, 
I 
could curse the laws, that gave me cause to come to America. 
So now, &c. 
Oh, where are the neighbors, kind and true, that was once our 
country's pride, 
No more they are seen, at the fair on the green, or the dance 
by the green hill side. 
'Tis a 
stranger's cow, that is grazing now, where the cabin 
used to be 
With notice they were served to be turned out and starved, or 
come to America. 
So now, Jct. 
Oh, Erin Machree, must your children be exiled all over the 
earth, 
Must they think no more of you, astore, of the land that gave 
them birth, 
Must the Irish yield, like the beasts of the field; no, no, mush-
ala machree, 
They are going away in ships, with vengeance on their lips, to 
return to America. 
So now, &e. 
Written and composed by W. H. DELEHANTY 
Oh, let me speak, departing soul, 
E'er gone to ne'er return ; 
That I 
may tell my wicked life 
To whom it may concern. 
It may, per chance, do some one good, 
And no one any harm; 
But block the road that leads to ruin, 
Wrought by fair woman's charm. 
'1 he maiden, pure in innocence, 
Unknown to care and strife, 
May learn what conies of ignorance, 
To blast an holy life. 
And find a 
moral in this tale ; 
For I 
was once as pure 
As snow, that scarce of Heaven fell 
But I 
am pure no more. 
I 
never knew a 
mother's love, 
Nor felt her tender care ; 
For she did give her life for me— 
Ne'er blest me with a 
prayer. 
Though I 
was reared religiously, 
Was educated well, 
And moved in high society, 
Of which I 
blush to tell. 
_ 
Blush, said I? not blush, oh, no, 
I 
lost that with my name; 
And now but feel a 
justly throe., 
As one deluged in shame. 
I 
heard him promise faith and love, 
To share my life as well. 
In ignorance I 
sealed my fate, 
And so, alas, I 
fell. 
My father turned me from his door, 
And cruel words he said; 
My sisters dared not speak to me, 
So from the right I 
fled. 
Oh, curses on the promises 
That brightened all the way ; 
And false-eyed be that honeyed tongue 
That sweetened me astray. 
MORAL. 
Oh, innocence! oh, ignorance! 
Oh, youth! beware, beware! 
The path of love is beautiful, 
But ever hath a 
snare. 
E'en though 'tis decked with roses, 
The light of love adorns; 
Remember, where the flowers are, 
There's sure to be some thorns.

Happy Irish Pair. 
Written expressly for CHAS. REDMOND and GEORGIE BLAKE by Trios. 
DEVENNY, and sung by them with great success at 
all the Western Theatres. 
Oh here we are an Irish pair! 
Happy, jolly, happy Irish pair, 
And from Ireland we came— 
That's where we gained our name. 
Oh, how we love to sing and dance 
To pass away the time when'er we get a 
chance; 
We came over here from Padd 's 
land 
To see the sights so grand. 
CHORUS. 
Listen to the music, hark !—( Break) 
Makes us lively as a 
lark !—( Break) 
Just give us your attention for a 
while, 
To try and amuse you we'll do the best we can, 
Just watch the easy graceful style 
By this pair from Paddy's land. 
When we were in that happy isle. 
Where the boys and the girls are free from care, 
The moments we often did beguile 
To dance the merry hours away. 
No matter whether rambling on the green 
Or in our cabins so elegant and clean, 
Our hearts were ever free from care, 
We attended every Donnybrook Fair.

" Pretty as a 
Picture." 
Words by BENNETT and Fu.soN, and sung by them amid roars of applatt;e. 
Filson—Oh, my lung is gone since I 
took that horn, 
Such a 
darling girl waited on me; 
She looked like a 
star when behind the bar, 
And her hair was the color of clay. 
Such a 
lovely nose, ' twas like a 
rubber hose, 
And her mouth was as wide as the Hudson. 
Such a 
delicious breath, it was certain death 
To the man that buzzed her long. 
She's as handsome (Sym.) 
As a 
funeral, ( Sym.) 
And her voice was like a 
whistle in a 
tug-boat. (Sym.) 
She's my only girl, (Sym.) 
With such a 
lovely curl, ( Sym.) 
She's as handsome as the cobwebs on the wall. 
CHORUS. 
For my darling's sake I 
my life would take 
Just as freely as I 
would a 
bedbug's ; 
Such a 
lovely maid with teeth just like a 
spade, 
That I 
met down by the brook. 
Bennett—Oh my feet arc sore and my clothes are tore 
Since a 
cross-eyed girl has shook me ; 
Such a 
freckled face, teeth out of place, 
That I 
met down by the bay. 
Oh her liver lip, how it used to flip, 
When she tried to talk Italian, 
And her Spanish shoes, number thirty-twos, 
Would cover up the whole sidewalk. 
She's so lazy, (Sym.) 
And she's so crazy, (Sym.) 
And her voice was like a 
fish-horn on a 
Friday. 
She's presumptive, (Sym.) 
And she's consumptive; (Sym.) 
And her mouth would cover up a 
good size sewer. ( Biz) 
For my darling's sake, & c. 
CAPTAIN CUFF. 
As sung by Wm. SCANLAN, with great success. 
Some folks go in for whiskey, 
Some for most unpleasant dogs; 
Some fellows have a 
fancy 
For the most outrageous togs. 
I'm very gone on linen, yes, 
And wouldn't give a 
dollar 
For life, without a 
splendid show 
Of snow-white cuff and collar. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, ladies and gentleman, for my great desire for 
linen, I 
have achieved the great and glorious title of— 
CHORUS. 
Captain Cuff! Captain Cuff! 
You can tell me by my collar; 
Captain Cuff, Captain Cuff, 
Though I'm not worth one half dollar; 
I'm awfully stiff in style, 
My cigarette I'll puff; 
Then hi I 
hi I 
clear the way, 
here comes Captain Cuff. 
Sometimes a 
common fellow 
Of the lower order class, 
Wtll dare make some rude remark, 
Or mock me when I 
pass. 
And lots of vulgar little boys, 
They know me well enough, 
And oft salute me as I 
pass, 
With what cheer, Captain Cuff. 
Captain Cuff, etc. 
With darling eyes upon me, 
Through life I 
gaily march. 
My style shall be the stiffest; 
My motto shall be starch. 
Should my cuff and collar glory, 
Be ever gone and fled, 
You'll know that Captain Cuff's gone wrong, 
And his washerwoman's dead.

Why none's half so charming as Clarence Lavere. 
Dri a 
nice afternoon if the weather is fair, 
To my barber's I 
go to curl up my hair; 
Brush off my clothes fix myself all serene, 
For I 
always endeavor to look bright and clean. 
I 
am a 
good hand at billiards and like my good wine, 
A card player, well I'm considered quite tine. 
I 
never borrow trouble, always feel well, 
And a 
good joke I'm always quite ready to tell. 
While pivoting, etc. 
At a 
quarter of two I 
must be on Broadway, 
To meet a 
young lady I 
saw the other day 
Her pa he is rich—so at least I've been told— 
And all I 
desire is to grab at his gold. 
Then to the sea- beach iii summer I'll go, 
Cut such a 
dash, ah 1 
what a 
show. 
There in the ball- room to promenade and dance, 
With, any young lady I 
meet there by chance. 
While pivoting, etc.

monds and Spades--and each of these into K for King, Q for Queen,

The Cards are arranged in 
four rows, and are to be read according to directions.

method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under-
standing. Many professional Fortune-Tellers use these cards, and we 
are in receipt of letters in relation to them from all parts of the U. S.

Courting Cards.— This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such P. way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by 
mtlemen who are either too diffi-
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unladylike encourage-
) 
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which mighthave been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. 
This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes a 
further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties

IILIMPTY 
IT 
DLIMPTY, 
PLEASES BOTH OLD AND YOUNG, 
It is a Fac simile of a Trick practiced by all 
the Professors of Magic. 
It is arranged so systematically, and is accom-
panied with directions so plainly written, that, with 
a 
single perusal, any person may become an adept 
in an unfailing source of amusement. 
Read what a leading Journal says of it: 
"An ingenious little book of the thaumaturgie order 
has been sent us, called 
ilIIMPTY Dumpry,' and bound 
in such a 
way as to give opportunity for a 
decidedly 
puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary appear-
ance of a 
child's picture-book, gayly printed and colored, 
it is so bound that a 
practiced manipulator, taking it 
up, and flirting the leaves rapidly over, can make it ap-
pear to be filled with copies of only one picture, or with 
blank pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of 
figures. 
One minute the pamphlet, quickly thumbed, 
appears to contain nothing but portraits of Harlequin, 
in his tesselated suit; the next, only Columbine ; then, 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or Mephisto-
pheles. 
A little practice, and the directions printed 
with the book will make anybody at . home in the hand-
ling of it."—Phila. Evening Bulletin.
