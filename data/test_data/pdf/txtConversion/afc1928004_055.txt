'TwAs by chance the other day as I

And as she passed me by my heart felt mighty queer, 
For she was altogether such a 
pretty little dear. 
CHORUS. 
Her name it was Susanna, 
She played on the piano, 
She stole my heart away and made me feel so queer, 
For she was altogether such a

Was at a

But of all the gals that there was there my charmer was

Her name it was, etc. 
But now she's gone away, bnt where I

With ruby lips and golden hair that hung around in 
curls.

CHORUS.

Oh Susie Brown can't you come down to town.

A great big nigger six foot tall fell in love with Susie 
Brown, 
But when I

For down de room I

When I

ADOLPHUS MORNING-GLORY. 
Written by Jon MURPHY, and sung by FRANK KERNS. 
Goon evening, white folks, keep your seats and to my song 
just listen; 
I'm here to-night to tell my little story, 
And what Pm going to elucidate will make your eyeballs 
glisten ; 
So gaze upon Adolphus Morning-Glory, 
Oh I 
know a 
little colored girl, whose blush is silver 
sweetness, 
And throws a 
magic spell about me, 
She is Sweet and lovely as the rose, a

sweetness, 
Just suited to Adolphus Morning-Glory.

LOVELY AS A ROSE. 
Written by BOBBY NEWCOMB, and sung by FRANK KERNS. 
I going to sing a 
song, I 
hope it ;will please You all, 
About a 
yaller charmer I 
met at a 
fancy ball; 
She was handsome, tall, and slender, her waist was vex! 
small, 
The gayest thing about her was her dashing waterfall. 
CHORUS. 
She was such a 
charmer, 
I 
had her for a 
partner, 
She was lovely as a 
rose, her eyes were black as coal, 
And as she gazed upon me oh my heart away she stole. 
There is one thing I 
will mention before r 
say good-bye, 
tier hair it was a 
fiery red, she was left-handed in one eye, 
That giraffe foot of hers projected at the heel, 
But as I 
gazed upon her oh how happy I 
did feel. 
She was such a 
charmer, etc. 
I 
will describe her charms as I 
met her at the ball, 
A boxing glove stuck in her net, she wore as a 
waterfall, 
A double-jointed nose, a 
foot like a 
giraffe, 
And when she went to promanade. it made de darkeys 
laugh. 
She was such a 
charmer, etc. 
GINGER CROW. 
GINGER CROW. 
As originally sung by FRANK K EUNS. 
15 
I 
AM a 
happy darkey, I 
come from de State of Georgia, 
My mothers name was Dinah and my farder's name was 
Pete, 
Of all de nig round de town I 
was hunkey dorey, 
An,,ther darkey Ike me you would very seldom meet, 
1 
am none of your black contrabands, but a 
good square 
Southern nig 1 
am, 
And when it comes to business this darkey's place he 
k 
flows, 
- 
For my name is Ginger Crow, and I 
come from down be-
For I 
was born in Georgia where de sugar cane does grow. 
I 
could a 
deal relate about the South and de plantation, 
Where I 
was a 
piccaninny and heard de roosters crow, 
But good-bye cotton pickings and overseer's dckings, 
And de pine woods near de swamp, where my love and I 
did go, 
Where the blue jay whistled pleasantly, and squirrels 
sported merrily, 
Upon de mossy banks and in de trees, you know, 
I'm a 
callus darkey blade :nd I 
never was at aid, 
For 1 
was born in Georgia where de sugar cane does grow. 
Geo-f.r.,e Washington, our massa, a 
noble man in peace was 
he, 
Great Gifts unto t'e darkeys he f 
eely- did bestow, 
lie drove away de red c,,ats dat roosted in the cAountry, 
Across the storwy ocean Jo '.n Bull was forced to go, 
There's one thing undohbted that cannot be conhmnded, 
Inspect cI4 nigger cranium and it will plainly show, 
THE TWINS. 
Funnier works cannot be found if you search dis world all 
round, 
Than the nigs who live in Georgia, where de sugar cane 
does grow. 
THE TwINS. 
As sung by rEANK KERNS. 
IN 
form and figure, face and limb, 
I 
grew so like my brother, 
That folks got taking me for him, 
And each for one another. 
It puzzles all both kith and kin, 
It reached a 
dreadful pitch, 
For one of us was born a 
twin, 
And not a 
soul knew which. 
One day to make the matter worse, 
Before our :names were fixed, 
As we were being washed by nurse, 
We got completely mixed. 
And so you see by fate's decree, 
Or rather nurse's whim, 
My brother John was christened me 
And I 
was christened him. 
The fatal likeness ever dogged 
Our footsteps when at school, 
For I 
was always getting flogged, 
If John turned out a 
fool. 
In fact, year after year the same 
Absurd mistake went on, 
And when 1 
died the neighbors came 
And buried brother John, 
IfF.LIND1 JONES. 
MELINDA JONES-
As 
sung by FltANR KERYS. 
I'm a 
darkey, head and. 
ears in love, 
But of that I 
don't complain, 
For "
I 
love a 
yal.er charmer, 
Melinda Jones is her name. 
When first I 
saw Melinda dear, 
'Twas massa s 
wedding morn, 
We darkeys all assembled there, 
At de tooling of de horn. 
CHOUUS. 
Then dance away, let's be gay, 
massa's wedding morn 
I 
won t 
forget Melinda dear, 
And de tooting of de horn. 
She was a 
waiting maid to missus, 
And de overseer's pride, 
The envy of de wenches, 
And a 
1 
de world beside; 
But I 
charmed her wid my banjo 
And my light fantastic toe, 
And soon her heart was captured by 
Young Alabama Joe. 
Then dance away, etc. 
The plantation now is gone to smash, 
Old massa ran away, 
Across de seas to foreign climes, 
Far from America; 
But Linda stayed for me behind, 
She said she would not oo, 
And very soon she'll be the bride 
Of Alabama Joe. 
Then dance away, etc.

DE YALLER GAL D.A.T WINKED AT ME. 
WAITING FOR A BROADWAY STAGE.

THE TALLER GAL DAT WINKED AT ME. 
Sung by FRANK KERNS. 
Youn attention I'll ask for awhile 
To a 
song I'm going to sing you: 
It's about a 
pretty yaller girl I 
met when I 
was walking ; 
And she threw such a 
glanc, at me, 
She was pretty and as sweet as a 
flower, 
Such clothes you never did see— 
She'd a 
darling little bonnet with a 
flower garden on it, 
Had this yaller gal that winked at me. 
CHORUS. 
Oh my, she looked so sweet, and dressed so neat; 
With her tilting hoop and pretty little feet— 
As she went skipping along; 
Pretty little yaller gal I 
met while I 
was walking : 
And she threw such .a 
glance at me, 
As she stept across the gutter, my heart was in a 
flutter, 
For the yaller gal that winked at me. 
I 
immediately asked for her name, 
And she said it was Lucinda ; 
She said I 
was a 
stunner and for life that I 
had won her, 
And married we should be ; 
So I'd dress up, and I'd walk by her house, 
Eve y 
afternoon about three, 
And I 
gaze up at the window for to see my dear Lucinda, 
She's the yaller gal that winked at me. 
Oh she looked so sweet, etc. 
Oh ! you should have seen her on her wedding day, 
She was handsome as a 
Venus ; 
When the parson made us one why then the thing was 
done— 
So, I 
bought a 
little place out of tcwn, 
And I 
never felt so happy in my life; 
If you go by stop in and see; 
You'll be welcome by a 
wife that's as dear to me as Ili'' , 
She's the yaller gal that winked at me. 
Oh my, she looked so sweet, etc. 
WAITING FOR A BROADWAY STAGE. 
Written by Bonny Nnwcomu, and sung by Faslis KlEnxs. 
As up Broadway I 
strolled one day, 
To see the styles pass by; 
A pretty little girl 1 
very soon met, 
She had such a 
roguish eye, 
Her short skirts in points hung down, 
For that style's all th ,. 
rage; 
She was looking up and down with a 
pretty little frow-
Waiting for a 
Broadway stage. 
CHORUS. 
She was just about the girl that is all the rage, 
Sweet sixteen was just her age, 
I 
met her on the corner, it was there that I 
first saw I_ 
Waiting for a 
Broadway stage. 
She saw that I 
was lookir1:4 at her, 
When a 
sweet little smile like a 
beam, 
Ju ,t 
played about her face, and with such ease and grat-; 
Wh,. like a 
little angel she (lid seem, 
But I 
felt getting, like any one, in fear, 
For my heart was like a 
bird in a 
cage, 
I 
wish I'd never seen that handsome little queen, 
Waiting for a 
Broadway stage. 
She was just about, etc. 
But as the ice was broken, 
My hat, of course, 1 
raised; 
20 
GAY AND FESTIVE NIG. 
As the stage that she required soon came by, 
She said, in tones so sweet, perhaps some time we'll 
meet, 
As up the steps her little form did glide, 
But I 
never yet have seen her, 
Though I 
wander in despair, 
For it seems that since we met has been an age; 
.But I 
never can forget that pretty girl I 
met, 
Waiting for a 
Broadway stage. 
She was just about, etc.

GERMAN MILLIONAIRE. 
GERMAN MILLIONAIRE. 
Banjo solo, sung by SAM SHARPLEY. 
THERE was a 
little German man, not very big in size, 
lie toted round the oven, and he peddled oyster-pies ; 
He used to live on Switzer kase, sauer-kraut, and lager 
bier. 
And he lived up in a 
garret near the Hudson Riv-i-eer. 
But when this cruel war broke out, this German man, he 
said, 
" 
I'll travel down to Dixie's land with Abraham's brig-
ade." 
he went off as a 
sutler with the Union armiee, 
Now .he's a 
codfish member of the aristocracy. 
Repeat lust two lines for chorus. 
This German laid in a 
stock, the werry biggest size, 
lied India-rubber doughnuts, and he'd gutta-percha 
Pies ; 
He'd benzine whiskey by the yard, 'twas drunk by every 
one, 
And he soon raked in the greenbacks till he had about a 
ton. 
He cnr. a 
swell about the town, and then in love be fell, 
With a 
big contractor's tt.noliter, a 
Jersey City belle. 
Says he, ' 
It' she would marry me, how happy I 
would be, 
Like a 
bully codfish member of the aristocracy 1" 
Her daddy didn't like the match, and so the gal to fix, 
lie sent her to the 'syltun where they keeps the lunatics. 
The German man went crazy then, with drinking lager 
bier, 
And they bough t 
him to the 'sylum, where he met his 
crazy dear. 
His clothes were stuffed with greenbacks, so she said she'd 
be his bride, 
Then Alderman O'Shaughnessy the padlock knot he tied; 
DE SASSENGER MAN. 
Election time was coming on—he quickly set them free, 
Two crazy codfish members of the aristocracy. 
SEQUEL. 
They went, it at an awful rate, till all their cash was 
spent,; 
The German man was broken, and he didn't have a 
cent; 
His money gone, he found he hail to go work vgin. 
And now he goes around the town, a-crying, " Glass put 
in ! " 
His frow advertised for a 
place, and got it mighty soon, 
An now she's first lieutenant in a 
lager bier saloon ; 
And when they travel through the streets, they happy 
seem to .be. 
Two played-out codfish members of the aristocracy. 
DE SASSENGER MAN. 
As sung by GEORGE W ARREN'. 
• 
Mistletoe 'Bough." 
TEE sausages hung in a 
pork butcher's shop, 
A hanging on strings from the hooks on the top ; 
The butcher looked blue at the counter behind, 
You could see there was something troubling his mind. 
He was the inventor of the patent michine 
That could chop up a 
paving- stone neat and clean; 
And a 
happy man he had been, I 
am told, 
If it wasn't for his wife, a-most terrible scold. 
Oh, the poor sausage man, 
The unfortunate sassenger man. 
The black puddings looked white and the white ones 
looked black, 
As he cast a 
sheep's eye on the room at his back,— 
She was screaming and crying and tearing her hair,— 
He had just been Wowed up and his wife she was there. 
DE SASSENGEE MAN. 
29 
gow he looked for once, determined and bold, 
And he said to himself, " I 
will cut this here scold. 
I'm tired of hearing her prattle and prate, 
And I'm blowed if to- morrow I 
don't emiurate!" 
Oh, the poor sausage man, 
The disconsolate sassenger man. 
Now the very next morn he was not to be found, 
And the eopi.e 
all said his, mind was unsound 
lie left all his clothes- and his inone.) 
behind, 
And the woman that treated him very unkind. 
They sought him that day and they sought him that 
night, 
And his wife she was in a 
most, terrible fright-
They searched the town. over and over again, 
They advertised him too but 'twas all in vain. 
Oh, the poor sausage man, 
The skedaddling sassenger man. 
Thus things went on till a 
week passed away, 
When something so strange came to pass one day, 
The b'ef sausage looked red and the pork ones white, 
The pork said to the beef, " I 
don't feel quite right." 
At last an old gentleman in a 
big burry, 
Rushed into the shop in a 
terrible flurry,.; 
He went to the mistress and to her did say, 
"I bought some pork sausages here yesterday." 
Oh, the poor sausage man, 
The not- to- be-found sassenger man. 
" 
Your sausages, won't do, ma'am, my, people ain't glut-
tons, 
I 
found in them all these here pantaloons buttons! 
She looked at. 
the. buttons, then cried in despair, 
" 
They're my husband's " thea. laws ! how the: old chap 
did stare. 
She cried out aloud—and she looked so queer— 
" 
He's been made into sausage, ' t-is, plain and clear!"

SALLIE OF THE SEWING-MACHINE. 
The old fellow rushed wildly out of the door, 
And from that day to this, he was neser seen more. 
Oh, the poor s

SALLIE OF THE SEWING-MACHINE. 
As 
sung by ED. M URPHY. 
I'LL sing to you of a 
beautiful maid, 
The fairest that ever was seen • 
She dressed in glorious, magnificent style, 
For she worked on a 
sewincr-machine. 
She was courte I 
by a 
gay m known cavalier, 
Whose means were abundantly able 
To support her in luxury as long as she lived, 
For he worked in a 
swill- milk stable. 
She would work all day with nothing to say, 
Not knowino, where trouble would bring her ; 
She d 
sing as she'd work and work as she'd sing, 
For her sewing machine was a 
Singer. 
Her lover's brain would whirl like a 
spool, 
While on his broom he would lean; 
And the strings of his heart would go pit- a-pat, 
For Sallie of the sewing machine. 
He sent her a 
letter to tell her of his love, 
Which caused this maiden for to weep ; 
She clos ,:d up her eyes and hum down her head, 
She was wrapt in the blankets of sleep; 
And when she was dreaming of her lover so bold 
Her face was calm and, serene; 
The needle flew up and back-stitched her nose, 
Poor Sallie of the sewing- machine. 
MORAL . 
Now all young maidens take warning by this, 
Especially you that are green; 
Always keep sharp things from sticking in your nose 
Or you'll never work a 
sewing-machine. 
THE STRAWBERRY GIRL. 
As sung by G. F. mcDoNALn„ COinedion. 
W ITH this humble stock in store, 
Which is not my own, 
I 
your patronage implore 
For tlre sad and lone; 
List to little Julia's cry, 
Buy my strawberries—come buy! 
Cheer'd by that good woman's face, 
Loaded from that hand, 
Which I 
found in the market-place, 
here 
take my stand ; 
And beseech those passing nigh, 
Flowers and strawberries to buy. 
Let an only grandchild's prayer, 
Brave in duty's part, 
Raise the sympathetic tear, 
Move the friendly heart; 
Aged grandparents alone, 
hungry wait for me at home. 
While they're,wretched, weak, and poor 
Begging's not so mean; 
They can't go from door to door— 
Childish though I 
seem, 
All their wants I 
can supply— 
Quickly then my strawberries buy.

Oa! sweet is the smile of the beautiful morn, 
As it peeps thro' the curtain of n.glit,

While the stars seem to smile with delight. 
Old nature now lingers in silent repose, 
And the sweet breath of summer is calm,, 
While I

How sad and unhappy I

And forever be happy with me! 
I'll smile when you smile, and I'll weep when, you weep, 
I'll give you a

And all the fond vows that I've made yol, I'll keep; 
What more can I

Does the sea have such bright and such beautiful charms 
That your heart will not leave it for me 
Oh ! why did I

Like a

Oh! Shamus O'Brien, etc.

GARRET NEAR THE SKY. 
As ;ung by FRANK K ERNS. 
THE cottage by the sea you've heard of, 
But not the garret near the sky; 
A 
cottage life methinks is lovely, 
But life in a 
garret's high. 
Though I 
cannot hear the surging billow, 
Nor see the waves as they roll high, 
I 
hear tom-cats when on my pillow, 
In my garret near the sky---
Yes, I 
often hear the cats moll-rowing, 
In my garret, in my garret near the sky. 
I 
have no roses near my dwelling, 
No honeysuckles strew, my bedroom floor, 
But New York smoke I'm always smelling, 
And squalls I 
hear front kids next door; 
The milkman's call it oft, disturbs me, 
And the cat's- meat man's voice ringing high— 
And the smoke it won't go up the chimney, 
In my garret near the sky— 
Yes, the smoke it won't go up the chimney, 
In my garret, in my garret near the gky. 
Though no white cliff's soar above, me, 
House- tops and chimney-pots I 
gee; 
I 
can gaze on St. Paul's steeple, 
That's more than you can near the sea.

Central Park, just near dark, 
And I

That it was a

That it was very cold ; 
Her name and address she then told,

And good wages was paid, 
And at the fine house where she stayed

But one evening she drove me quite mad, 
Yes quite mad, ' twa.3 too bad ; 
A Dutch barber beside her she had,

SWEET ISABELLA. 
SW.b.b.1 ISABEIXA. 
As sung by To 
PASTOR. 
I 
LOVE sweet Isabella, she loves another fellow, 
I 
often used to tell her, and stamp my mnbrella, 
If with another I 
caught her, I'd from this world trans-
port her, 
Her life should be much shorter than sun on a 
rainy day. 
I 
longed for her my wife to be, through going to Paris it 
wasn't to be, 
For, when she sat on a 
Frenchman's knee, it wasn't the 
cheese for me, oh! no! 
CHORUS. 
Oh! sweet Isabella ! her voice so sweet and mellow ! 
I 
caught her with a 
fellow, then with my umbre 
I 
fetched him such a 
smeller, and knocked him down the 
cellar, 
Because she loved this fellow, and she would not belong 
to me. 
By Marcus's Paris excursion, to spend a 
week's diversion, 
I 
now make the assertion. I 
took Miss Isabella. 
She wanted no persuasi ,n, but got up for the occagion. 
We took ourselves from London Bridge the exhibition to 
see; 
Scarce had we arrived in France, things went wrong, I 
saw at a 
glance; 
She was struck with men who could parlez-vous France, 
and didn t 
care " that" for me, oh ! no! 
Oh! sweet Isabella! etc. 
The Exhibition compartments we view'd, then took apart-
ments, 
The top- most-garret apartments, the Royal Hotel-Vic-
toria. 
We dined off' roast puppy- dogs, snails, and beautiful 
stewed frogs; 
42 
SWEET ISABELLA. 
And never knew what we had eat, till we found them 
movinr, " here." 
She began to talk French to the Valet-de-Shong—perhaps 
about me— she was talking so long, 
Running me down, as she could speak the tongue, of 
French nut a 
word could I 
say, oh ! no ! 
Oh! sweet Isabella, etc. 
Isabella! you couldn't resist her, just here she raised a 
blister, 
When once for hours I 
missed her, and knew the French-
man kissed her. 
One day, she thought me sleeping, not me.! for I 
was 
peeping, 
And saw my foreign brother with his arms around her 
waist. 
My blood was up; then, with one blow down the cellar-
steps, I 
laid him low ; 
When she, with her hands, soon let me know she loved 
him better than me ; alt ! yes ! 
Oh ! sweet Isabella, etc. 
My feelings I 
could not smother, I 
came back to my 
mother, 
She said George, try another; as they love one another. 
In France they soon got married; in France they never 
tarried, 
But came to good old England, and opened a 
Raspberry-
shop. 
• 
So, if ever a 
Raspberry-ice you get I 
hcpe poor me you 
won't forget 
How Ihe Fencliman my poor life upset, who lives in the 
W 
It i 
te-C ha pel road; oh ! dear ! 
Oh ! sweet I,abella! I 
hope you'll leave the fellow, 
With his Raspberry-ice so mellow, but with this umbrella 
I 
could give him another smeller, and send hitu down the 
Because she loves this fellow, and she won't belong to me!

THROUGH THE PARK I 
GO. 
As sung by FRANK K ERNS. 
OH 
I'm a 
girl that's fond of life, 
My age is twenty-one ; 
I 
am averse to noise or strife; 
But very fond ot fun ; 
And tho' to vice I'm not inclined, 
I 
like the flattery of mankind, 
And always like to speak my mind, 
Alle to every one. 
CHORUS. 
As through the park I

The gents all want, to know, 
Who is that darling girl, 
Who drives so fast, they'd like to know 
I

And do just as I 
will ; 
While lovers come from IIPP1' and far, 
And me with nonsense fill. 
But I

And beg they will at once have done, 
But then they say I'm only in fun, 
As I 
laugh behind my fan.

SIXTEEN., 
As sung by FRANK K EENS. 
OLD hats, old rags! and my t= oubles were great, 
Could I 
be in a 
mo e w etched state, 
Indeed I 
feel that my heart it will break ; 
List and I'll tell my you wrongs. 
Hele I 
will my woes unfold, 
By a 
girl I 
have been cruelly sold; 
And through her I 
lost all my nice gold, 
My heart and my coat are loth gone. 
CHORUS. 
d hats, old rag,s, my cry was old hats, 
Dis stick in my hand, dis bag on my back, 
'Tis true, ' tis true I 
did love her so, 
But Slochen you know you vas sold, 
Old hats, old rags, old hats, old rags. 
I 
used to call on her most every day, 
Down on my knees I 
implored her to say 
She'd be my own wife, and not to say nay; 
And then she agreed to be mine. 
But oh my heart, I 
must have been green, 
For in my old coat I 
opened a 
seam, 
And gave ten dollars to my heart's queen, 
To buy her some things for the time. 
Old hats, old rags, etc. 
BirriR BEER. 
As sung in the " Great Lingard" Burlesque, by KF.RNS and SHEP-
PARD, at TONY PASTOR'S Opera House. 
THE subject of my little song, 
Is one I 
hold most, dear, 
It supports the constitution, 
And it has for many a 
year. 
John Bull will shortly be defunct, 
Or else look very queer, 
If Bass and Co. should cease to brew 
Their glorious Bitter Beer. 
CHORUS. 
Alsops, Bass and Co., they each deserve a 
monument, 
So give them while we are here, 
Three cheers for Bass and also Bank, 
Their glorious Bitter Beer. 
I've tasted Hock and Claret too, 
Maderia and Moselle, 
Not one of those boshy wines 
Revives this languid swell. 
Of all complaints from A 
to Z, 
The fact is clear there's no disease,

By Bass's Bitter Beer.

STATUES. 
As sung in the " Great Lingard" Burlesque, by KERNS and SHEP-. 
PAM), at To2ty PAsTaa's Opera House. 
PERMIT me here to represent 
Some great and noble men, 
My photographic studio, 
I 
trust may pleasure give, 
Forever in our memory 
These noted, men all live. 
First the Corsican Brothers, 
As on the stage they boast, 
There is a 
very cutting scene between 
Fabian and the ghost. 
When Fabian sees his brother's ghost, 
It fills his breast with woe ; 
And when he goes to seal the letter, 
I 
think he stood just so. 
A 
statue now, I'll show you, 
Beloved by every one, 
The father of the nation, 
The great George Washington. 
May many follow in his path, 
And to their country prove no foe. 
So hail Columbia's warrior, 
As I 
represent him so. 
Now we have Mayor Hoffman, 
Who has done all he can, 
To stop the. great excise law; 
And,aid the working man; 
ON THE BEACH. 
He's an able politician 
And has gained himself applause. 
So I 
think now here you'll give a 
cheer 
-- 
For Hoffman and his cause. 
Then there's General U. S. Grant, 
As rni about to show, 
Who led his troops to glory, 
And struck terror to the fop. 
If any foreign enemy, ' 
His trumpet dares to blow, 
We'll find him once more in the front, 
Standing, I 
think, just so. 
Now with your kind permission, 
I'll introduce,to you, 
The chief man of the nation 
Andrew Johnson, good and true, 
•Many have fought hard against him, 
.But he says it's all no go, 
And when he faced his enemy, 
He stood, I 
think, just so.

ON THE BEACH. 
As sung in the" Great Lingard" Burlesque, by KERNS 
and SIIEP• 
PARD, at TONY PASTOR'S Opera House. 
'TwAs on the beach at Long Branch, one fine summer's 
day, 
I'd a 
novel reading to pass the time away, 
And so interested was I 
in the plot, 
A 
gent stood there beside me, still I 
saw him not; 
Till at last, by chance, my eye- lids I 
did raise,'" 
I 
found him on ale looking with enraPtur'd gaze; 
Bright blue eyes so charming, handsome Greciin nose, 
Teeth of pearly whiteness, quite the pink of beaux.

THE GALLUS *PAIR. 
CHORUS. 
'Twas on the beach at Long Branch, one fine summer's 
day, 
I 
met this handsome man who stole my heart away; 
Now I 
feel so happy as blissful moments glide, 
The day is quickly coming wheal shall be his bride. 
As like one awaking from some happy dream, 
We glances did exchange, his eye with love did beam, 
And ere much time was over we began to chat. 
Hours passed away, still he beside me sat, 
And with ways so winning he did love impart, 
My spirits rose as high as the early morning lark; 
He told me that he loved me, said'that all his life 
Would be to him worthless unless I'd be his wife. 
On the beach, etc. 
He said that if I'd marry, all troubles we would drown, 
And live in blissful ignorance of all the cares of town. 
With soft persuasive power he told me of his'love; 
Vowing to be true, by all the powers above! 
He asked me if I'd marry, pressed me then to say, 
Till, to his wishes yielding, I 
named the happy day. 
He said his cup of bliss was filled quite to the brim, 
He'd live alone for me, and.I.*ne ,for him! 
On the beach, etc. 
THE GALLUS PAIR. 
As 
sung by the Itronnmex BOYS. 
Oa here we are a 
gallus pair, 
We just come out ,to sing, . 
We'll tell you what will happen us, 
Quite early in the spring; 
We are going to the parson's house, 
And be put right into one, 
THAT'S WHERE THE LAUGH COMES IN. 
49 
And if our mammies don't consent, 
We'll cut our sticks and run. 
CHORUS. 
We are a 
gallus pair, 
You bet your life we are, 
We're going to have a 
jolly time, 
And raise a 
mighty row, 
So white folks keep your eyes on us, 
And we will show you how. 
Jim was born in old Bentuck, 
And Sal in old Virginny, 
When Jim was only four months old, 
Just like a 
piccaninny, 
And when she was just eight months old, 
Just big enough to walk, 
She says dis darkey took her heart, 
Oh Jim what makes you talk. 
We are a 
gallus pair, etc. 
Jimmy, I 
do feel so queer, 
Oh Sal, I 
feel so too, 
Oh Jimmy, I 
am going to faint, 
Let me unloose your shoe; 
Oh Jimmy, I'm ashamed of you, 
Why don't you see the ladies 
Ashamed you never ought to be, 
With a 
dozen piccaninnies. 
We are a 
gallus pair, etc. 
THAT'S WHERE THE LAUGH CONES IN. 
As 
sung by GEOUGE WAnnEx. 
LADIES and gents, don't think I 
intrude, 
To the many few questions to which I 
allude; 
JOLLY OLD COUPLE . 
The ladies wear petticoats all trimmed in red, 
With big waterfalls on the top of their head, 
That look like a 
ten-penny loaf of Dutch bread, 
That's where the laugh comes in. 
Thad Stevens and Butler they played a 
nice trick, 
To impeach Andy Johnson, they've worked, till they're 
sick, 
They thought it was sure' all along from the start, 
And said from the White House he'd soon have to part; 
But you bet he'll stay there till the fourth of next March, 
That's where the laugh comes in. 
t . • 
11 
The radicals they didn't give Andy a 
chance, 
But at next election we'll make. 'em all dance; 
King Kennedy then, will go in a 
balloon,' 
His friend, Ben Butler, will have nary spoon; 
We'll have our lager on Sunday, and that very soon, 
That's where the laugh comes in. 
As sung by the H IBERNIAN BOYS. 
Sinn a 
jolly old couple as here you see, 
There is not in this whole world wide; 
For forty years together, my boys, 
We travelled side by side; 
A 
pattern to the neighbors round, 
My good old wife has been, 
And such a 
jolly old fellow as mine, 
There never has been seen. 
CHORUS. 
Round goes the world, troubles we defy, 
Jogging along together, my boys, 
My dear old wife and I. 
Now young folks, take our advice, 
As this world you go through, 
And always do unto others, 
As you would have done unto you; 
Care or sorrow don't give away, 
But court instead of sigh, 
Then you'll be like my old man, 
And my old wife and I. 
Round goes the world, etc. 
HAPPY LITTLE DAREEYS-
As sung by the H IBERNIAN BOYS. 
HAPPY little riigs are we, 
Just as gay as gay can be; 
Always laughing, never sigh, 
Twist our heel and wink our eye. 
CIIORUS . 
That's my notion, 
Watch dis motion; 
Happy little darkeys and I 
want you all to know, 
With the scientific movement of de heel and t,e. 
When at night our day's work's done, 
That's the time we have our fun; 
Den we are merry, light and free, 
Sorrow never comes to we. 
That's my notion, etc. 
All the world's the same to we, 
Joy in every thing we see; 
Snow or cloudy, wet or dry, 
Always laughing, never sigh. 
That's my notion, etc.

As sung by the HIBERNIAN BOYS. 
On here we are before you now, 
And feeling mighty gay ; 
We just came out for a

Oh Sally is so beautiful, 
And as sweet as sugar cane, 
The darkeys dey all envy me, 
And got her on the brain, 
And try to charm her heart away, 
But that will never be, 
We're like a 
pair of Siamese twins, 
Are Sally Ann and me. 
Oh, yes, there's, etc. 
We take things as they come 'and go,

No matter how the breezes blow,

As gay and happy through dis life 
As Sally Ann and me.

• 
On white folks, listen while I 
sing 
Of a 
great calamity ; 
It happened to a 
gal, her name was Sal, 
So dearly she loved me; 
She left her home on my account, 
To cross the raging sea, 
It almost breaks my heart to think 
How dat poor girl suffered for me. 
I 
took her out on a 
Sunday afternoon, 
Just for to have a 
lark; 
Says she, my dear, the ball is up, 
Let us go to the Central Park. 
When we got to de ice she went to strike out, 
But de ice was slip-pery, 
Her heels flew up, she came down cum-plung, 
How dat poor gal suffered for me.

54 IT'S ASTONISHING HOW 
IT'S' DONE, BUT IT IS. 
I 
courted her for seven long years, 
With all my might and Main, 
-4.11d swore that none could separate me 
From my sweet Susan Jane ; 
But it happened on one dark and stormy night, 
To an oyster saloon weut, she, 
When she choked to death with an oyster stew, 
How dat poor gal suffered for me. 
ITS ASTONISHING HOW IT'S DONE, BUT IT IS. 
As sung by FRANK K ERNS. 
Ant—" Wonderful how they do it, but they do." 
A 
CHAP to get along in this wide world of ours, 
Must have his cranium screwed on the right way, 
And be one of those sort of chaps who always get's in 
debt, 
Then places trust in providence to pay. 
With the business of all he must acquainted be, 
But never let a 
single soul know his; 
We always End those chaps can get along like mad. 
It's astonishing how it's done, but it is. 
A fellow now possessed of three hundred dollars a 
year, 
Does oftener live up to five and six, 
lie cuts about like winking, in fine style does appear, 
While his creditors ( poor devils) oft get nix; 
But when the bubble bursts, they find they have chiselled 
been, 
And then they pulla rather lengthy phiz, 
When ' tis too late they find they've all been bled like 
lambs. 
It's astonishing how 'tis done, but it is. 
My landlady last week brought a 
long bill to me, 
Demanding of me twenty-five weeks' rent, 
YOU'LL REMEMBER ME. 
55 
But I 
soft-soaped her over, and very soon could see 
My gammon caused her soft heart to relent; 
When I 
said her I'd wed, she believed all that I 
said, 
And little thought that her I 
meant to quiz; 
She gave me a 
receipt in full, and then I 
cut my stick. 
It's astonishing how it is done, but it is. 
Then Mrs. Betsy Brown, she's a 
buxom little wife, 
And tho' she's only just in her prime, 
She has twenty little pledges, and has taken now of late, 
To present Brown with three cherubs at a 
time ; 
Brown often, with an oath, says, " it's coming it too 
strong," 
And for such kindness doesn't thank his Liz, 
For three times in succession she has had three children 
at a 
birth. 
It's astonishing how it's done, but it is. 
YOU'LL REMEMBER ME. 
New serio-comic song. 
As sung by Fnixit K ERNS. 
Now listen to a 
story sad, 
Of a 
gal I 
loved, named May; 
My peace of mind was ne'er disturb'd 
Till a 
chap stepp'd in the way ; 
For she was as lovely as the morn, 
And she lived at Jersey— 
And I 
always thought upon my life ! 
That she'd remember me. 
One moonlight night, when the stars shone bright, 
Towards her home I 
stroll'd, 
When in the parlor there I 
saw, 
The chap a 
sitting bold;

And as I

I

lie called " police !" the bobbies came, 
lie told them what I'd done, 
And then before a 
magistrate, 
Of course I 
had to come ; 
The judge, with one eye on his book 
From me would take no fee, 
And as he sentenc'd me six months, 
lie said, " Now you'll remember me.'

Dearer than all you're to me, 
If only made of the right sorter. 
Stiner's purest of black, 
Maketh the mouth well to quiver, 
And maketh the lips well to smack, 
Oh ! from this tea I'll never sever. 
Fountain of pleasure untold, 
Beautiful cup of nice tea. (Repeat.) 
If you've been out on the spree, 
Nothing on earth's so refreshing; 
Beautiful cup of good tea, 
Surely to man you're a 
blessing ! 
Headache and sickness soon flee

Nothing on earth can outvie 
A

POLLY PERKINS OF WASHINGTON SQUARE. 
As sung by FRANK K ERNS. 
PS a 
broken-hearted butcher-boy, 
In grief I'm arrayed, 
Through keeping the company 
Of a 
young servant-maid, 
Who lived on board- wages, 
The house to keep clear, 
In a 
gentleman's family, 
Near Washington square. 
CHORUS., 
Oh! she was as beautiful as a 
butterfly! 
There's none could compare 
With pretty Polly Perkins 
Of Washington Square. 
Her eyes were as black 
As the pips of a 
pear, 
No rose in the garden 
With her cheeks could compare; 
Her hair hung in ringerlets 
So beautiful and long! 
I 
thought that she loved me, 
But I 
found I 
was wrong. 
Oh! she was, etc. 
When I'd call in the morning, 
And cry: Meat! below, 
58 
FOLLY PERKINS OF WASHINGTON SQUARE. 
At the sound.of my voice, 
Her face she would show, 
With a 
smile upon her countenance, 
And a 
laugh in her eye 
If I 
thought she'd have loved me, 
I'd have laid down to die! 
Oh! she was, etc. 
When I 
asked her to marry me, 
She said : Oh ! what stuff! 
And told me to drop it, 
For she had quite enough 
Of my nonsense—at the same time, 
I'd been very kind, 
But to marry a 
butcher- boy, 
She didn't feel inclined. 
Oh ! she was, etc: 
Oh! the man that has me, 
Must have silver and gold— 
A chariot to ride in, 
And be handsome and bold; 
His hair must be curly 
As any watch- spring, 
And his whiskers as big 
As a 
brush for clothing. 
Oh! she was, etc. 
The words that she uttered 
Went straight through my heart, 
I 
sobbed, I 
sighed, 
And straight did depart, 
With a 
tear on my eyelid, 
As big as a 
pear, 
„lidding good-bye to Polly Perkins, 
And Washington Square. 
Oh! she was, etc. 
MY DADDY WASN'T PARTICULAR. 
59 
In six months she married, 
This hard-hearted girl, 
It was not a 
Viscount, 
It was not an Earl, 
It was not a 
Baronet— 
But worser by far, 
'Twas a 
bow-legged conductor 
On a 
Third-avenue car! 
Oh, she was, etc. 
As

Ant—" It's my Delight of a 
Shiny Night." 
M Y 
daddy wasn't particular, 
As long as he could find 
That everything he wanted 
Was exactly to his mind ; 
My mammy, she was hard to please, 
And yet I've heard her say, 
She ne'er would quarrel with my dad, 
For giving her her way. 
She ne'er, etc. 
For my part, I 
am easier Pleased 
Than either he or she ; 
For only give me all I
. ask, 
That's quite enough for me; 
Good clothes, a 
horse, a 
wife that's young, 
And wine that's very old; • 
A 
purse, I 
do not care how long, 
So it is filled with gold. 
A 
purse, etc. 
Four meals a 
day, a 
spree at night,

Would answer all my ends;

OH! SHOULDN'T I LIKE, OH MY! 
A house as big as this, and twice 
As full of smiling friends ; 
With these I'd make arshift to live, 
Nor think of care or pelf, 
Yes one thing more, let all my friends 
Be happy as myself. 
Yes, one thing more, etc. 
OH!. SHOULDN'T I 
LIKE, OH MY ! 
As sung by FRANK KERNS, with unbounded applause. 
THE other night, at dark, I 
thought I'd take a 
gentle 
stroll, 
So down Broadway I 
went, in a 
sort of jaunting roll; 
Gay carriages I 
gaz'd upon with quite a 
longing eye, 
Then quietly remarked, " oh shouldn't I 
like, oh my I" 
Oh ! shouldn't I 
like, oh my ! upon my word it's true; 
I 
would I 
could, but if I 
can't how can I/ now could

On my way by chance I 
met my wife, who quickly me did 
stop, 
And press'd me—like most ladies do—to visit the draper's 
shop; 
I 
went just like a 
lamb, when a 
French hat she did spy, 
Says she, " you'll buy it dear I 
oh, shouldn't I 
like, oh, 
my ! " 
Oh, shouldn't I 
like, etc. 
Then there's her pretty cousin, who on the piano plays, 
And with her angel voice will oft sing me some plaintive 
lays; 
And when she does, her looks are sweet, but when she 
heaves a 
sigh, .. 
To relieve her little heart—oh shouldn't I 
like, oh my! 
Oh shouldn't I 
like, etc. 
• 
A married lady friend oft visits my dear wife, 
But every time she calls, oh dear! it's Sure to cause me 
strife 3 . 
Because she has a 
pretty babe—and mine's got none; 
but why 
Should she blame it all to me—oh shouldn't I 
like, oh, 
my! 
Oh shouldn't I 
like, etc. 
At St. John's, Varick street, I 
went the other clay 
To see a couple married, and hear the bridegroom say, 
" 
I 
take you Miss, for wedded wife," when the bridesmaid 
gave a 
sigh, 
And look'd as if she wished to say, oh shouldn't 
like 
oh my ! 
Oh shouldn't I 
like, etc. 
At Barney Williams' Theatre, I 
the other night did see 
Two ladies slyly take a 
glance in a 
box just vis-a-vis, 
I 
caught their looks, now strange to say, just as I 
raised 
my eye ; 
They dropp'd their heads, and smiling said, " Oh shouldn't 
I 
like, oh, my " 
Oh shouldn't I 
like, etc. 
Now my motto's tempus fugit, so I'll wish my friends 
" 
good night," 
For to infringe on time too much, you'll say would not be 
right; 
But happy I 
shall be, when again you're passing' by, 
To try and please you one and all, oh shouldn't I 
like, 
oh, my l 
Oh, shouldn't I 
like, etc.

THE LITTLE WOMAN AND HER EGGS. 
THE LITTLE WOMAN AND HER EGGS. 
As sung by FRANE K ERNS. 
Ain—" Box about." 
Mann was a 
little woman, as I've heard tell, 
Fal de ral lal lal de dee, 
She went to market her eggs for to sell, 
Fal de ml lal lal 12.1 de dee; 
She went to market all on a 
market day, 
Fal de ral lal lal lal de (lee, 
And she fell asleep all on the highway, 
Fal de ral lal lal lal de dee. 
There came by a 
peddler, whose name was Stout 
Fal de ma! lal lal lal de dee, 
And he cut her petticoats all round about, 
Fal de ral lal lal lal de dee; 
He cut her petticoats up to her knees, 
Fal de ral lal lal lal de dee, 
Till this poor little woman began for to freeze, 
Fal de ral l.il lal lal de dee. 
When this little woman began for to wake, 
Fat de ral lal lal lal -de dee, 
She began to shiver and she began to shake, 
Fal de ral lal lal lal de de6 ; 
She began to shake and - she began to cry, 
Fal de ral . 1a1 lal lal de dee, 
Lord have mercy, on me, this be none of I,

If I

Now the moral of this, I'm going to say,

If you meet an old woman asleep by the way,

Don't cut her petticoats off of her legs,

But wake her up and buy all her eggs,

I'LL ASK MY MOTHER AND LET YOU KNOW NEXT 
SUNDAY AFTERNOON. 
As sung by FRANK K ERNS. 
A PRETTY little girl came courting me, her name was 
Sarah Broome• 
She wanted me to marry her, and thought I 
was a 
loon, 
She said " I 
was a 
nice young man, and we might be well 
off soon ;" 
But I'll ask my mother and I'll let you know next Sun-
day afternoon. 
CHORUS. 
The kindness of this pretty little girl I 
never can forget, 
That wanted me to marry her, but I 
cannot see that yet. 
I'LL ASK :AY 3.‘10THER , 
ETC . 
One afternoon, Miss Sarah Broome took me out for a 
walk, 
She kissed me and caressed me, and so lovingly did talk, 
She wanted me to fly with her that night by the light of 
the moon ; 
But I'll ask my mother and Pll let you know next Sun-
day afternoon. 
The kindness of, etc. 
She made me a 
present of .a 
Watch and cliaiiillkewise 
bran- new hat, 
For Sundays, when I 
walked with her, that I 
might cut 
it fat; , 
But when she found I 
would not fly with her, she wanted 
the presents back, soon ;-
But I'll ask my mother and I'll let you know next Sun-
day afternoon. • 
, 
The kindness of, etc. 
Out of revenge, with one she knew, she ran away that 
night ; 
They both came back for the watch and chain, and wanted 
me to fight; 
He said, in a 
field if he had me, that he would kill me 
soon ! 
But I'll ask my mother and I'll let -you know next Sun-
day afternoon. 
The kindness of, etc. 
If there's any young girl, that's here to-night, would like 
to be my Wife, 
Let her step forward, and I'll do the best for her, through 
life; 
And if she's in a 
hurry, why, we might be married soon ; 
But Pll ask my mother and I'll let you know next Sun-
day afternoon. 
The kindness of, etc. 
HARDWARE LINE. 
65 
IIARDWARE LINE. 
As 
sung by FRANK KEnws. 
YES, my old dad was a 
money- making notary, 
And sipping his wine, has often told, 
That woman was a 
riddle, and marriage a 
lottery, 
And wives at the altar were bought and sold. - 
His reason for this I 
cannot divine, - 
For it was not the case with the wife of mine; 
She'd a 
father and a 
mother, a 
sister and _a brother 
And they all got a 
living in the hardware line. 
She'd a 
father and a 
mother, etc. 
The words that he uttered, caused quite a 
panic 
In my youthful mind; so, I 
soon did decide 
To cut broadcloth and in the garb of a 
mechanic, 
From the unwashed multitude to seek a 
bride. 
'Twas's there I 
found thig wife of mine, 
When I 
laid my heart at Cupid's 'shrine; 
She'd a 
father and a 
mother, a 
sister and a 
brother, 
And they all got a 
living in the hardware line. 
She'd a 
father and a 
mother, etc. 
Every town and village, I 
did rummage 'em, 
England, Ireland, and Scotland through, 
Till at last I 
came to the good old town of Brummagem, 
A second edition of the Wandering Jew. 
'Twas there I 
lost this heart of mine, 
To one of the gender feminine ;. 
She'd a 
father and a 
mother, a"sister- and a 
brother, 
And they all got a 
living in the hardware•line. 
She'd a 
father and a 
mother, etc. 
Her brother was a 
gunsmith, her sister was a 
burnisher, 
Her mother made buttons at threepence a 
gross ; 
Her father he plated harness furniture, 
.She kept the books of profit and loss. 
GG 
Tin: BROADWAY BRIDGE. 
Three months for her did I 
waste and pine, 
Before I 
asked her to resign 
Her father and her mother, her sister and her brother, 
- That all got a 
living in the hardware line. 
Her father and her mother, etc. 
She's a 
first-rate hand at a 
brewing or a 
baking, 
She can knit silk purses or make mince pies ; 
Her bonnets and her dresses are all her own making; 
Her home-made bread takes all by surprise ; 
Champagne or claret, from the banks of the Rhine, 
Can't be compared to her gocseberry wine, 
Tho' she's a 
father and a 
mother, a 
sister and a 
brother, 
And they all get a 
living in the hardware line. 
Tho' she's a 
father and a 
mother, etc. 
My days they pass in one round of pleasure, 
I 
feel as if I 
should never grow old ; 
For, a 
wife that is good is a 
priceless treasure, 
And more to a 
man than silver and gold. 
Far better than a 
useless lady fine, • 
Is this busy, merry, cheerful little wife of mine ; 
Tho' she'd a 
father and a 
mother, a 
sister and a 
brother, 
And they all got a 
livin2 in the hardware line. 
Tho' she'd a 
father and a 
mother, etc. 
nib BROADWAY BRIDGE. 
As sung by FRANK K ERNS. 
Ant—" Bow wow, wow." 
0 CITY Fathers, bless your hearts!—I 
say, and so say 
others, 
For the new foothold you've vouchsafed to city wives and 
mothers. 
No more we scud across Broadway, like sheep before a 
drover; 
We thank your honors for the bridge that carries us safe 
over. 
On the Broadway Bridge— 
Everything is lovely on the Broadway Bridge. 
The climbing up is pretty steep, and saucy men (how dare 
they ?) 
Stare at us as, with tripping gait, we lightly mount the 
stairway. 
Well, let them glower; what do they see save neat per-
ambulators, 
Too beautiful to splash through mud, like bayou alliga-
tors. 
On the Broadway, etc. 
We do not lift our skirts half-mast; quite modestly we 
raise them; 
We don't quite disappoint the. men; but neither do we, 
craze them. 
And such of us as Nature scrimped a 
trifle in the shap-
ing, 
Are almost squeamish in their care to guard against un-
draping. 
On the Broadway, etc. 
When plunging wildly mid the throng on yonder mun-
dane level, 
Up went our garments on one side—we quite forgot the 
level : 
But now we're calm and self-possessed, and never think 
of shocking 
The moral taste of Christian youth with half a 
yard of 
stocking. 
On the Broadway, etc. 
68 
TI/E BROADWAY BRIDGE. 
The gallant paladins in blue, from kerb to kerb who lug 
us 
(It has been said, but that's a 
fib, that now and then they 
hugged us), 
Look up to us with sheepish eyes, as asking do we love 
them; 
But more than e'er we did before we feel ourselves above 
them. 
On the Broadway, etc. 
We wish that at each terminus they'd keep a 
bright look-
. 
out though, 
For thieves who grab at reticules—they're very much 
about now. 
Sometimes we lose amid the press portemonnaies, brooch-
es, lockets— 
'Why don't the azure-coated squad protect our bags and 
pockets 7 
On the Broadway, etc. 
The bridge should be reserved, we think, exclusively for 
ladies, 
For to our sex, by broadcloth brutes, no proper deference 
paid is; 
Set it apart, ye City sires, for us, the " weaker vessels," 
And let the" fellows " take their chance down underneath 
the trestles 
Of the Broadway, etc. 
More bridges, too, are much required— say one in the vi-
cinity 
Of Stewart's store, one at Canal, and one from Wall to 
Trinity; 
And some folk think that one or two the Bowery stands 
in need of, 
But that's a 
working people's street, that ladies take no 
heed of. 
Like the Broadway, etc. 
DEAR FATHER, COME DOWN, ETC. 
CO 
Amidst the two conflicting streams, half-equine, half-
vehicular, 
That jam Broadway, no lady can Maintain her perpen-
dicular ; 
And so our earnest thanks are due to Mayor and Corpo-
ration 
For giving us a 
chance at last to cross without prostra-
tion. 
On the Broadway, etc. 
The street's " relieved," and so are we—we 'scape a 
world 
of splashing, 
And save a 
dollar each per week in under-garment wash-
ing, 
While on our " coign of vantage" perched, or from its 
span alighting, 
We care no more for Broadway mud than does its patron 
—Whiting! 
On the Broadway, etc. 
DEAR FAIRER, COME DOWN WITH THE STAMPS. 
As 
sung by FRANK K ERNS. 
OH! father, dear father, come down with the stamps, 
My dressmaker's bill is unpaid ; 
She said she would send it right home from the shop, 
As soon as the flounces were made. 
Come down, come down, come down! 
Please, father, dear father, come down I 
CHORUS . 
Oh! bear the sweet voice of thy child, 
Who cries in her room, all alone; 
Oh ! who could resist her most pitiful tears 7 
So, father, with stamps quick come down ! 
My new dress from Stewart's is down in the hall, 
The boy will not leave without pay ; 
I've nothing to sport with—can't go to the ball; 
So please send the shop-boy away. 
Come down, come down, come down! 
Please, father, dear father come down ! 
Oh! hear the, etc. 
Oh I 
father, dear father, come down with the stamps, 
My curls are not fit to be seen; 
The hair-dresser said he would not do them up, 
Unless I 
could pay him fifteen. 
Come down, come down, come down! 
Please, father, for Braiteau come down! 
Oh! hear the, etc. 
He only asks twenty to give a 
new set, - 
And take the old hair in exchange ; 
Besides, pa, my waterfall's awfully rough ; 
And so, my back hair will look strange. 
Come down, come down, come down 
Please, father, for Braiteau come down! 
Oh ! hear the, etc. 
IF YOUR FOOT IS PRETTY, 
SHOW IT. 
As 
sung by FRANK KERNS. 
IF 
your foot is pretty, show it, 
No matter where, or when; 
Let all fair maidens know it, 
The foot takes all the men; 
The face, so fair and lovely, 
May charm the gazer's eye, 
But if the foot is homely, 
he'll quickly pass you by, 
He'll quickly—he'll quickly,— 
He'll quickly pass you by.

THE:ROSE OF ALABAMA. 
71 
If your foot is pretty, show it, 
if you NO611 to catch a 
beaux; 
No longer hide the tell-tale charm, 
Beneath so many clothes ; 
The figure may deceive you, 
All hooped and padded o'er; 
But let me but survey the foot, 
I'll ask to see no more, 
I'll ask—I'll ask— 
I'll ask to see no more. 
If your foot is pretty, show it, 
When you trip along the street, 
For it will catch the eager eyes 
Of every man you meet ; 
Don't toss your glossy ringlets, 
Nor pout your lips so sweet, 
But gently lift your petticoats, 
And show your handsome feet, 
And show— and show— 
And show your handsome feet. 
THE ROSE OF ALABAMA. 
As sunk by FRANK KERNS. 
AWAY from Mississippi's vale, 
With my old hat there for a 
sail, 
I 
crossed upon a 
cotton-bale 
To Rose of Alabama. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! brown nosey, Rose of Alabama, 
A sweet tobacco posey is the Rose of Alabama. 
I 
landed on a 
sandy bank, 
I 
sat upon a 
hollow plank 
72 
THE ROSE OF ALABAMA. 
And there I 
made the banjo. twank, 
For Rose of Alabama. 
Oh! brown nosey, etc. 
Oh! after d'recly, bye-and-bye, 
The moon rose white as Rosey's eye; 
Then like an young coon out so sly, 
Stole Rose of Alabama. 
Oh ! brown Rosey, etc. 
The river rolled, the crickets sing, 
The lightning-bug he flashed his wing. 
Then like a 
rope my arms I 
fling, 
Round Rose of Alabama. 
Oh! brown Rosen etc. 
I 
hug so long I cannot tell, 
For Rosey seemed to like it well; 
My banjo in the river fell, 
Oh! Rose of Alabama. 
Oh! brown nosey, etc. 
Like an alligator after prey, 
I 
jutnp'd in, but it float away, 
But all the time it seem'd to say : 
Oh! Rose of Alabama. 
Oh! brown Rosey, etc. 
And every night, in moon or shower, 
To hunt that banjo for an hour, 
I 
meet my sweet tobacco flower, 
My Rose of Alabama. - 
Oh! brown Rosey, etc.
