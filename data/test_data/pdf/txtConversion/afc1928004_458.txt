HARRY MONTAGUE, 
"The Artist Comique of the Day," 
AND THE ORIGINATOR OF THE M ODERN STYLE 
COMIC SINGING. 
His attractive elements are ; 
A GOOD VOICE, 
FINE APPEARANCE, 
PLEASANT GENIAL STYLE, 
AND NATURAL DELIVERY. 
He always produces something NEW, with 
catching 
words and sparkling music, and it is not surprising that with 
r.uch qualities he is immensely successful wherever he appears, 
for as an author, composer, vocalist and comedian he occupies 
preeminently the front rank ; and his Motto, Comic, Descrip-
tive and Topical songs have made his name famous through-
out the country. 
OF 
Written, composed, and sung with immense success by H ARRY MoN-
TAGUE, the " Artist Comique." 
There was a 
man who boasted that from trouble he could 
keep; 
He always followed out the motto—" Look before you leap;" 
He took such strong precautions that the people soon began 
To own there never was, or could be, such a 
careful man. 
CHORUS. 
He was a 
careful mall, he was a 
careful man; 
Where'er he went ' twas his intent 
To be a 
careful man. 
In June he wore an overcoat, to guard against the storm, 
And left it off in winter, in case it should turn warm. 
He never rode in coach or cab, for fear the horses kicked ; 
He always sewed his pockets up to stop their being picked. 
He was a 
careful man, & c. 
He always eat quite sparingly, for fear that he'd get stout, 
And had his bed made on the floor, for fear that he'd fall out; 
He never knew the time of day— it may appear a 
silly thing— 
And he never would wind up his watch, in case he'd break 
the spring, 
e 
was a 
careful man, &e. 
You'd never see him smoke at all, neither day nor night. 
For fear while puffing his cigar he set himself alight; 
He never goes to balls or parties anywhere in town, 
Because one night by chance he slipped and pulled his part-
ner down. 
He rarely lived in one place long—his nature was to roam— 
At last he went to Brooklyn, and has since made .that his 
home; 
He joined a 
local vestry, which pleased his friends so much 
They soon induced him to become the parson of their church. 
He was a 
careful man, Ike. 
He preached on every topic, and it was his constant aim 
To astonish his congregation and earn himself a 
name. 
Now, not long since he thought he'd go and see New York 
by night, 
So he took two detectives along with him to show him all the 
sights. 
He was a 
careful man, &c. 
He saw so much of loveliness, and of beauty frail but fair, 
And a 
handsome young creature made love to him—a 
blonde 
with golden hair; 
But for fear that he'd be led astray he went down upon his 
knees 
Beside this lovely damsel, and—began to say his prayers! 
For be was a 
careful man, &c, 
MOTTO SONG. 
Sung with great success by HARRY M ONTA.GUE. 
What care I 
to-day for the world and its way, 
I 
can smile when the poor they do frown ; 
Though rich I 
have grown. there's no one can say, 
The poor man I 
ever put down. 
I 
help him along when I 
find him in need, 
. 
What more would you ask me to do— 
But it's this that I 
want to impress on your minds, 
Though rich I'm no better than you. 
CHORUS. 
Though you see me to-day in this costly array, 
Who knows what I 
yet may go through ? 
So you'll find just as far as equality goes, 
Though rich I'm no better than you. 
Last night in the street a 
poor man I 
did meet, 
Who asked me if aid I 
would give, 
I 
extended my hand at the poor man's demand. 
Yes, says I, my dear friend, you must live. 
I 
gave him assistance, he thanked me and said, 
It is hard sir, but what can I 
do ? 
Says I, my dear friend, be that as it may, 
. 
Though rich I'm no better than you. 
Though you see rue, &c. 
In conclusion I'd state though your lot may be great, 
Don't think yourself better than all, 
But bear this in mind, for its truth you will find, 
The greatest of men sometimes fall. 
Tho' the poor man may want and the rich man may have, 
There's one thing I 
know to be true, 
Let death come a-knocking at either man's door, 
Though rich I'm no better than you. 
Though you see me, &c. 
Sung with great success by HARRY M ONTAGUE. 
You see I 
am so very good, I 
never claim a 
thing, 
That don't belong to me, you know, for that would be a 
sin; 
I 
assure you I'm as honest and as truthful as can be, 
And I 
wouldn't think of picking up what don't belong to me. 
While walking down the street one day, by a 
policeman I 
was 
stopped, 
Who said, " I 
think this purse, young man, from your coat 
pocket dropped ;" 
Now, as I 
never carry one, I've so little cash, you see, 
Like an honest man, I 
said at once,'" It don't belong to me." 
CHORUS. 
It don't belong to me, it don't belong to me, 
You'd better inquire of somebody else, it don't belong to me; 
I 
never saw the purse before, it can't be mine you see, 
I 
know nothing whatever about it, it don't belong to me. 
M y 
wages being very small, I 
live in quiet style, 
But with the girls I 
lah-de-dah, and the agony I 
pile; 
I 
tell them almost anything, for I've got lots of cheek, 
They little think I 
do the grand on eight and a 
half per week. 
One day I 
bought a 
waffle, which I 
popped inside my hat, 
For I 
saw a 
lady corning along, and I 
knew she'd stop and chat; 
My hat blew off, the waffle fell out, the street boys laughed 
with glee, 
But when they brought it back I 
said, " It don't belong to me." 
I 
never saw that waffle before, &c. 
I 
occupied a 
front room in a 
house not far up town, 
And in the back room lived a 
girl, whose name was Jenny 
Brown, 
Whene'er I'd chance to meet her, well, I'd pass the time'OrdaY,' 
And have a 
little talk with her, in a 
friendly sort of way. 
The other night when I 
got home, oh ! what a 
dreadful scene, 
And my landlady asked of me, " Now, what does all this 
mean ?" 
" 
Miss Brown has gone, but left behind this bundle, as you see," 
Said I, " You quite surprise me, but it don't belong to me."' 
I 
never saw the bundle befote, &c:

Same Old Game. 
.1.Ing with immense success by H ARRY M ONTAGUE, the great vocal 
comedian. 
When I 
was a 
little lad, and the darling of my dad, 
I 
was troublesome as troublesome could be. • 
If I 
saw a 
little boy and he had a 
little toy, 
I 
was sure to make him give it up to me; 
And if he would say nay I 
would upset all his play, 
A 
proeeeding which was sure to bring me blame; 
And although my cheeks were often dripping with the scold-
ing and the whipping, 
Yet I 
carried on the same old game. 
CHORUS. 
The same old game, the same old game; 
I'd a 
spirit that my daddy couldn't tame, 
For it mattered not to me what it cost me for a 
spree, 
Yet I 
carried on the same old game. 
Now when I 
older grew, more of mischief I 
still knew, 
For danger with my doings did increase. 
Let the time be day or dark, I 
was up to every lark, 
And our neighbors never knew a 
minute's peace. 
Ringing door- bells, breaking lamps, pitching into rogues and 
tramps, 
While fighting all the bummers gained me fame; 
And although each little spree was very dear to me, 
I 
carried on the same old game. 
The same old game, & c. 
In time I 
grew a 
man, yet still mischief was my ban, 
For I 
made the pretty darlings my delight. 
Big or little, dark or fair, it would never matter where, 
I 
was teasing them from morning until night, 
And to each and all I 
said, " Some fine day we will get wed," 
And there was at least a 
dozen made a 
claim; 
So the judges in the courts fined me heavy for my sport, 
But I 
carried on the same old game. 
The same old game, &c. 
Now I'm settled down in life, and I've got a 
little wife; 
We're as happy, yes as happy as can be. 
But I 
regret to state that I 
often stop out late, 
And then she raises " Ned " with me. 
But all that is amiss I 
settle with a 
kiss, 
And thus my little darling do I 
tame; 
But sometimes she comes it strong, for her nails are very long, 
Yet I 
carry on the same old game. 
CHORUS. 
The same old game, the same old game ; 
I'd a 
temper that my daddy couldn't tame, 
For it mattered not to me what it cost me for a 
spree, 
Yet I 
carried on the same old game.

It's No Business of Mine. 
Sung with overwhelming 'applause throughout the United States, by 
HARRY NiONTAGUE. 
I 
want to put you all in a 
good humor, 
And you know that I 
never refuse, 
For no matter from whence I 
obtain it, 
In getting at all the late news. 
Now if you will listen a 
moment, 
I'll tell you in my little rhyme 
Of some things I 
have seen that are curious, 
But of course it's no business of mine. 
Now for instance, at Mrs. Montgomery's, 
Every afternoon just about five, 
While her husband is down town at business, 
A 
nobby young gent does arrive. 
He always stays there until eight, 
But her husband don't come home till nine; 
Now I'd like to know what he is doing there— 
But of course it's no business of mine. 
A 
friend of mine yesterday told me 
Last Wednesday he had such a 
lark ; 
He met Mrs.—never mind who, 
While taking a 
walk in the Park. 
He offered the lady his arm, 
Aid took 
took her to Brooklyn to ditie ; 
They never got back till next morning— 
But of course it's no business of mine. 
I 
met Lucy Bell t'other evening, 
With her nephew out taking a 
walk, 
She stopped, of course, when she saw me, 
And. then we had a 
nice talk 
About her dear little nephew, 
Who she says is between eight and nine. 
Now some say he isn't her nephew— 
Well of course it's no business of mine. 
There's another young lady, Miss Baxter, 
A 
fine, handsome, dashing young girl, 
She's been flirting for over a 
year 
With a 
fellow by the name of Fitzfurl; 
She says she is going to get married, 
'Pon my word I 
think it's quite time, 
For if she's not married soon, why, she ought to be, 
But of course it's no business of mine. 
In New York, at the Manhattan Bank, 
Three millions were stolen away, 
And the janitor was handcuffed and bound, 
In the broad open light of the day. 
Now to me this seems very- 
queer, 
And I'll wager a 
bottle of wine 
That the director i 
knew nothing (?) about it I 
But of course it's no business of mine.

Can't She Dance the Can-Can 
Sung all over the country with the greatest success by the " Artist 
Comique," H ARRY M ONTAGUE. 
There is a 
charming lady who lives around these parts, 
Who has gained a 
reputation for breaking young men's hearts; 
Her personal attractions have won for her renown, 
And I'm the latest victim of Miss Arabella Brown. 
Her attitude is pensive, and when she walks abroad 
Her style of sweet simplicity has all the fellows floored ; 
If you could see her pretty face, you'd say you never saw 
Such simple, child-like innocence in any face before. 
CHORUS. 
But can't she dance the Can-Can 
Upon the strict Q. T. ! ( quiet) 
She's the sort of a 
girl to p'ay the deuce 
With a 
man like me. 
Don't she dress in the fashion ! 
And can't she sing and play! 
She's the sort of a 
girl to make you feel 
In a 
happy sort of way. 
Her little hat upon her head quietly was placed, 
Her gloves have twenty buttons, and her stockings look like 
lace; 
Her little shoes are number one's, to put her ' tootsies in ; 
Her form—ah, well, it is superb, and she has such lovely skin. 
When she goes out to promenade, all the fellows rush 
To gaze at this dear creature, which makes the poor girl 
blush; 
She is so very bashful when she walks along the street, 
And she never shows her ankles, much less her pretty feet. 
_  
13 
When I 
take her to the theatre 1 
sit down by her side, 
Then she's the observed of all observers, and her face she 
tries to hide ; 
She puts her fan before her eyes, because she is so shy, 
And tells me all the sporting news she has heard upon the sly. 
She has worked me a 
pair of slippers and lots of pretty things, 
And I 
think she's an angel, born without her wings; 
Although she's had many an offer, she still remains a 
maid, 
She says she'd like to marry, but she really is afraid. 
When she goes to a 
party, and stands up for a 
dance, 
She is so very bashful and has such a 
modest glance; 
She waltzes, oh ! so stately, so gracefully and grand, 
And don't her partner often feel the pressure of her hand ! 
To take her down to supper all the young men try, 
But somehow she doesn't see it, whenever I 
am by ; 
She sits down to the table with an air of sweet repose, 
And I 
often feel her tiny foot treading on my toes. 
SPOKEN—I 
can assure you she's a 
splendid girl, and when-
ever I 
go to see her she always shows me, in the back parlor, 
how elegantly she can dance the Can-Can. 
The other day I 
took her out for a 
promenade, when I 
met a 
particular friend 
of mine, who said to me the next day: " Harry, do you know 
who that lady was you were walking with yesterday?" 
I 
said, " Certainly ; she's a 
very nice girl ; I'm keeping com-
pany with her; she lives on West Fourteenth street." 
So 
my friend commenced to laugh at me, and said, " Why, 
Harry, she's one of the paid dancers up at . the Buckingham 
Palace." 
I 
told him I 
didn't believe it. 
He says, " All right ; 
we'll go up there to- night and you'll be satisfied." 
Sure 
enough, when we got up town and on to the ball- room floor 
the 
first 
person 
that 
caught my eye was my beautiful 
Arabella— 
But can't she dance the Can-Can, &c. 
Sung with immense success by the great vocal comedian, HARRY Ni ON 
TAGUE. 
Although I 
am married, I 
know a 
sweet girl— 
I'm uncommonly fond of the sex— 
But this pretty girl, though she's spooney on me, 
All the time she does nothing but vex ; 
She vows that she loves me, and sometimes she calls, 
Perhaps in the midst of the day ; 
She comes to my door with a 
knock, knock, knock, 
Then I 
have to go to her and say— 
CHORUS. 
Now don't knock too loud at the door, now don't; 
Now don't knock too loud at the door, now don't; 
There's somebody near, and perhaps they will hear, 
So don't knock too loud at the door, now don't. 
Now I 
made an appointment to meet this pretty dear, 
Who is really so bright and sublime, 
But oh, what a 
row—I 
remember it now, 
For I 
didn't get there just on time. 
She tame hurryirg down to my residence, 
Where I 
thought to be out of the way; 
She came to the door with her loud sentiments, 
Which of course compelled me to say— 
Now don't knock too loud, &c. 
Some time after this there came to my house 
A man that stood six foot, two; 
He came to inform me that he was her dad, 
And to know what I 
meant to do. 
I 
informed him my wife was not far away, 
And asked him to speak with a 
thought, 
But he shouted still louder, and insisted that I 
Should appear the next morning in court. 
The next day I 
appeared at the court, and there stood 
The girl ',loved in my heart; 
She swore up and down I 
had promised to wed, 
And from it she wouldn't depart. 
I'd to pay fifty dollars. 
The Judge he then said 
I 
was lucky it was not any more ; 
As I 
left the court room I 
heard the crowd cry— 
" 
Now don't knock too loud at the door." 
SPOKEN—And you can bet that this put a 
stop to my flirta-
tions ; for now I 
remain at home, and my wife and I 
get 
along splendid together, and I 
never have to say any more— 
Now don't knock too loud at the door, &c.

Matrimonial Troubles. 
k Comic Duet. 
Written by HARRY M ONTAGUE, and sung by MISS 
CARRIE DUNCAN and HARRY MONTAGUE with great success. 
HE— I 
tell you it's too bad, I 
tell you it's a 
shame, 
For I've been nearly mad since first your mother came; 
She came here on a 
visit, she said she'd stay a 
week, 
But she's been here a 
year or more—I 
never saw such 
cheek. 
HE— Oh ! 
Harry, what are you about ? 
HE—SO now I 
give you warning, 
She goes to-morrow morning. 
HE— Harry ! 
112—Carrie, I'll turn your mother out. 
sir, at last it's come to this, and I 
must plainly 
speak: 
No longer will I 
be so dumb, no longer I'll be meek ; 
You have no right to interfere in this unseemly way, 
And if you try to domineer, you'll find I 
won't obey. 
HE—Some wives do. 
SHE—And some wives don't. 
HE—Some wives will. 
SHE— But this wife won't. 
It seems very hard— 
IIE—I don't think it should. 
SHE— I'll go and tell my mother. 
IIE—I only wish you would. 
[He goes to table and writes u 
1,t ter.] 
HE— Take this letter to your mother, 
Tell her she's a 
plague to me. 
SHE—Just excuse me, you're another, 
And you'd better let her be. 
If you get me in a 
passion, 
Then your conduct you will rue. 
HE—Since divorces are the fashion, 
Would you like to leave me, too? 
Take this message to your mother, 
Tell her that I 
hope she'll be 
Off at once, somewhere or other 
Far across the deep blue sea. 
SHE—I say it is disgraceful the way you're going on ; 
You know my ma is not the kind to play your jokes 
upon. 
At six o'clock, when she gets up to get your breakfast, 
sir, 
This is the way, you horrid brute, you stand and talk 
to her: 
" 
Now, Maria, blow the fire—puff, puff, puff." 
HE—That's because I 
know she's such a 
muff, muff, muff. 
SHE— I thought you were a 
gentleman, but I 
find you are a 
rough, 
And of this conduct I 
have had enough, nough, ' nough. 
HE—Your tongue is most unruly; you really must reflect. 
SHE—'Twas you commenced this row, my dear, be pleased to 
recollect. 
HE—I 
won't be called a 
rough, my love, 
I'd sooner run away. 
SHE—Oh, you can go just where you like, 
I 
shan't ask you to stay. 
HE —
Good-bye, Carrie, I 
must leave you. 
SHE—Oh, why did I 
marry and believe you. 
HE—Your sweet mamma can stay, and I 
will go away', 
So think of me when sitting doual to tea. 
SRE—Oh, I 
used to think in the days v.-hen we were young, 
When boy and girl we played, 
1;7 
That you'd be ever true, for dearly I 
loved you, 
You made me such a 
happy little maid. 
When mother had the kettle on to boil, 
And made you stay and take a 
cup of tea, 
You told me then how gladly you would toil 
If you could only pass your days with me. 
I 
love to think of the days when we were young, 
When around your neck I 
clung. 
HE—Yes, we were happy then. 
SHE—We may be so again; 
Oh ! Harry, think of the days when we were young.

You know we had a

SHE—Well, Harry, if you let her stay another week or two, 
I'll tell her she must go away, or else agree with you. 
HE—All right, my dear, and never fear, 
If while she with us dwells, 
If she don't scold me, then we'll be 
As gay as wedding bells. 
TOGETHER— 
The bells that rang merrily, ding, ding, Jong. 
How happy I 
was when I 
heard their sweet song! 
I 
fancied they said " You shall never get wrong, 
But both be happy at home." 
HE—And now I 
am as happy ps when we first were wed. 
SHE—And when you said you'd leave me you didn't mean 
what you said. 
HE—When I 
am angry. darling, I 
don't know what I 
say. 
SHE—And I'm certain if you left me you couldn't stay away 
TOGETHER— 
And now we'll happy be, 
And go through life so merrily, 
So merrily, so merrily, 
We go through life so merrily.

I 
MET a 
lady at a 
ball 
As beautiful as day. 
Of graceful figure, slight and tall, 
And hair like golden spray. 
I 
said this is a 
happy chance, 
And I'm a 
happy man, 
And as I 
led her out to dance 
She laughed behind her fan. 
CHORUS. 
She laughed behind her fan, 
And said " You naughty man, 
You shouldn't do so, it's wrong, you know!" 
And laughed behind her fan. 
We danced the Lancers and Quadrille, 
Then rested for a 
while, 
But once we nearly had a 
spill 
Thro' some one's clumsy style. 
I 
clasped her waist more tightly then, 
'Twas ilea and sweet to span, 
And when her eyes met mine again 
She laughed behind her fan. 
She laughed, etc.-
I 
saw her to the carriage door, 
When it was time to leave, 
I 
fancied, but I 
wasn't sure, 
She slightly pressed my sleeve. 
I 
squeezed her hand, the old resource, 
The good old-fashi , ned plan, 
And as she felt the gentle force 
She laughed behind her fan. 
She laugeed, etc. 
I 
saw her in a 
month or so, 
One Christmas party night, 
And then beneath the mistletoe 
I 
claimed the season's rite. 
She said " 011, dear! my husband's here, 
I'm sure you never can!" 
And I 
felt queer, for much I 
feat 
She laughed behind her fan. 
She laughed, etc. 
NEVER MIND ME. 
Sung with overwhelming success by Ilminv MoNTAouit 
Artist Comique.” 
Spoken.—My usual luck, I 
passed by at the wrong moment, 
just as the young lady was tying her shoe-string; so I 
took an 
the 
extra puff on my cigar and says to her— 
Never mind me, etc..1 
Some people when they're wanted are never near the spot, 
4
, While others they are in the way, when wanted they are not. 
Now I 
am most unlucky, I'm always in the way, 
So I 
fear its quite by accident, and so I 
have to say— 
Never mind me, I 
can't see 
Don't mind me, I'm not looking, 
Never mind me. I 
can't see. 
Pont mind me for I 
won t 
look. 
Last summer 1 
went in the park, the place for happy days; 
And after seeing all I 
could, I 
strolled into the maze. 
I 
suddenly came en a 
couple, very much engaged, 
I 
fear I 
spoiled their little game, for they were quite enraged. 
SpokPa.—Well. ot course, there is no harm in a 
loving couple 
going in the park ; but its not exactly the place for a 
gentleman 
to be caught with his arms round a 
lady's waist. 
So I 
could 
see that this tender couple felt very much embarrassed at my 
sudden appearance, so T 
excused myself, and said to them— 
Never mind me, etc. 
I 
like a 
stroll up town, I 
do and so the other day 
I 
lit a 
weed, and took a 
walk just out of Broadway, 
And by a 
stoop I 
saw a 
girl, the kind of whom we dream, 
She had one foot up, and on seeing me, she blushed and gave a 
scream. 
My old friend, Peter Henpeck, has got a 
fistic wife, 
She bangs her " fives " on his " conk," and leads him such 
I 
chanced to stop in ' toiler day, to see what they were at, 
She had knocked poor Peter down, and they were fighting on 
The mat. 
Spoken.--Yes, there they were, fighting on the front door-
mat; well, the fact is, this couple don't get along very well to-
gether, and whenever they have one of their " family broils," 
Peter always comes out second best; now I 
never like to in-
terfere between man and wife whenever they have any trouble, 
so I 
said to this happy pair: '' Take it easy, Peter," " jump 
on his chest, madam"— 
Never mind me, etc.

Our clubs are hard, and our shields are bright, 
We're the finest police in the world.

And our praises are sung in the papers ; 
When we find a 
disorderly man, 
Very soon he is cur'd of his capers ; 
We are the pride of the nation wide, 
And around our footsteps, no law is defied ; 
The rogues all fear us on every side.

OH, here. we are a

And of us you had better all beware, 
We can play the banjo and dance and shout, 
And you can bet your bottom dollar, 
That our mothers know we're out, 
What a 
very funny pair are we. 
Oh! what a 
funny little chap is he, 
He is too smart for me, 
He went into a 
blacksmith shop 
To get out of tile rain, 
He picked up a 
red-hot horse shoe, 
And he laid it down again, 
What a 
smart young cna.p was he. 
Oh ! you need not laugh quite so loud, 
Of your smartness you need not be so proud, 
She bought a 
lot of hens, 
And in hot water put their legs, 
To see if she wouldn't make them 
Lay boiled eggs—what a 
smart little girl wag she 
Now you've got yourself into a 
stew, 
I'll tell all the people about you; 
She got married the other day, 
And her husband got tight, 
And he sat up courting her all night, 
Whet a 
fanny old man was he.

Grandpa's chair is vacant, 
Near the fire in the grate; 
Where he told his tales of boyhood, 
Kept the little ones awake. 
One eve, so worn and weary, 
Sleeping on his knee they lay, 
Death called that night, like the fire bright, 
Grandpa passed away. 
CHORUS. 
So let the room be cheerful, 
Place the old arm chair 
Where we talked to Grandpa, 
With his silvery snow white hair. 
How he'd watch the falling aishes, 
And sadly meditate, 
Gently sigh, we all must die, 
Like the fire in the grate. 
One bitter night in winter, 
The snow fell fast and wild; 
A 
girl looked in the window, 
A careworn, hapless child; 
Then Grandpa whispered " baby," 
And toddled to the gate, 
To save from sin, he brought her in, 
Near the fire in the grate. 
So let the room, eta 
Keep the fire burning, 
'Tis charity's bright flame; 
Reminding of the evening 
The orphan Mary came, 
Bo ragged, cold and hungry, 
With Grandpa from the gate; 
For him she kneels, a 
prayer she yields, 
Near the fire in the grate. 
So let the room, ate.

Oh! we've parted from each other, 
And our dream of love is o'er, 
That bright dream was too beautiful to last 
And we'll meet as only strangers, 
In the future evermore, 
Our once tender love is buried in tal..0 past. 
The' I've tried to bear the blow, 
Without sighs or bitter tears, 
And tried to smile when my heart ached with pain. 
Yet the burning tears would fall, 
In spite of all that I 
could do, 
For the darling one I 
ne'er shall see again. 
CHORUS. 
My dream of love is o'er, 
I 
try to smile when my heart aches with pain; 
But the memory of the past comes up before 
Me like a dream, for the darling one I 
ne'er shall see 
again. 
Ohl they say you love another, 
Who has claimed you for his bride, 
And you wish me to forgive and to forget; 
All the vows we pledged together, 
By the rippling of the tide, 
As I 
looked into your beauteous eyes—my pet. 
Ali! the heart is like the tides, 
That flow and ebb at will, 
I 
would not cease to love thee if I 
could; 
So, thro' all the future years, 
I'll love thee fondly, dearly, darling! 
For I 
could not cease to love thee if I 
would.

What makes you of me shy ? 
Meet me to-night at Taylor's, 
And sip the good old rye. 
The day is dawning fast, my love, 
I 
whisper in your ear; 
The evening soon is coming, love, 
In fact is almost here. 
Then pretty Jane, my pretty Jane, 
I 
beg you, don't be shy, 
But meet me in the evening, 
And sip the good old rye. 
And when you finish your first glass, 
I'll give the bell a 
ring; 
The waiter, in his jacket white, 
To answer it shall spring. 
The day is waning fast, my love, 
I 
whisper in your ear; 
The evening soon is coming, love, 
In fact is almost here. 
Then pretty Jane, my pretty Jane 
I 
beg you don't be shy, 
But meet me, all have proposed, 
And sip the good old rye. 
CHARACTER SONG. 
Written and Sung by ALICE Ross MTIREAY. 
Once more I 
am back to my childhood's bright home, 
That I 
left here just ten years ago ; 
Oh! little I 
thought that I 
thus would roam, 
Back here in my rags, filled with woe; 
I 
am tired and weary, and ready to fall, 
From ray journey across the wild moor; 
I 
am cold and hungry, unable to call, 
And afraid to knock at the door. 
CHORUS. 
I'm afraid to knock at the door—. 
I'm afraid to knock at the door--
To meet Father and Mother, 
Sister and Brother— 
I'M afraid to knock at the door. 
I 
will knock at the door, 
And if asked to come in, 
I'll take courage and try to be bold; 
I 
never could stand this piercing wind, 
I'd perish out here in the cold ; 
I 
dread to meet them, though I 
know they'll be glad 
To welconie the wanderer home ; 
I 
know they'll forgive me, 
For I've made them feel sad, 
But never again will I 
roam.

I 
once did love a 
pretty girl, 
My wife in time did make her; 
She 's 
as pret ty as the flowers in June, 
And a 
first -
class hoop -
skirt maker. 
She once did ask me for to wed, 
In words to me oppressive, 
But to Let married on ten dollars a 
week, 
It's rather too expensive. 
Cnonus.--Expense, now- a- days, must be looked at, 
If you live in a 
way that's blessive, 
Lay by a 
dollar when you can, 
And do not be too expensive. 
I 
took her to parties several times, 
But soon I 
lost my courage; 
Such pleasure is all very nice, 
But the money I 
could n't flourish. 
So I 
bought her peanuts by the quart, 
Which I 
thought would be acceptive, 
For ten dollars a 
week and to parties go, 
It 's 
rather too expensive. 
Cuottus.—Expense, now-a-days, etc. 
We are married now about one year, 
But sometimes I 
feel sorry; 
For keeping house I 
never thought 
Would cost me so much money. 
A flower here, a 
new hat there, 
Ribbon's, switches, rather taxive, 
Ten dollars a 
week, and dress like that, 
Is rather too expensive.

THE SWELL ON THE STOCK EXCHANGE. 
Sung with immense success by the great Comic Genius, HARRY 
MONTAGUE. 
I 
AM upon the Stock Exchange 
And deal in stocks and shares, 
And men must be uncommon sharp 
To catch me unawares. 
All that I 
touch turns into gold. 
That's why I'm such a 
swell. 
I 
know exactly when to buy, 
And always when to sell, 
Cnor.us. 
I'm a 
swell on the Stock Exchange: 
As through the streets I 
range 
Folks say, " How funny, he's rolling in money, 
The swell on the Stock Exchange." 
Of course you've heard of Bulls and Bears, 
But none with me compare. 
And when a 
Bull,— to make a 
"Dulls." 
A thing I 
can't a 
Bear. 
I'm often called a 
sportive cuss, 
And one who's pretty keen. 
And though I'm not at all a 
lamb, 
I 
gambol on the green. 
I'm a 
sw ell, etc. 
My luck prevails, yet other folks 
Misfortune cannot shun, 
They have to sell up everything, 
And sometimes cut and run. 
My secret they can't gauge, its clear. 
Till all their cash has flown. 
I 
speculate with others' coin, 
They only risk their own.

So when the weather's proper, I'm ready in a

To take my usual walk upon a

A 
drive out in a

But the exercise of walking I 
would most advise ; 
And, oh, such funny sights, and, oh, such horrid guys

Walking out on Sunday, in the afternoon, 
Driving out on Sunday, in the afternoon, 
Crawling out on Sunday, in the afternoon, 
It's awful jolly walking out on Sunday.

ow there's Augustus Tompkins, a 
very heavy swell, 
He manages to live somewhere on Murray Hill; 
You'd think he was a 
banker instead of a 
Broadway clerk. 
As he goes out to take his walk on Sunday. 
With his silver headed cane, and a 
glass stuck in one eye, 
He twirls his fine moustache, which suspicious looks of dye, 
In fact you seldom see so elegant a 
guy,

There's that pretty little shop girl, as she sweeps along, 
With the newest style of hat, from the Bowery, corner of Bond. 
In the distance you might take her for one of the Haut ton,

Got up regardless of expense to captivate some heart,

JUST for a 
change I 
thought I'd go 
To the seaside out of town, 
To battle each morning in the surf 
Then wander up and down. 
While strolling there on one fine day 
I 
met a 
charming beau; 
He asked me if I'd walk with him? 
Of course I'd not say no—for 
CHORUS. 
It's nice! it's nice! 
Now don't you think it is so? 
It's nice! it's nice! 
Now that's what they exclaim. 
It's nice! it's nice! 
Now don't you think so" 
Everybody says so, 
And of course we say the same. 
Then arm in arm along the beach 
For hours we did roam. 
He whispered tales of love 
As we returned towards home. 
He begged to see me to my door. 
I 
answered " No, my dear, 
But to- night at seven, if you'll wait, 
I'll meet you on the pier." 
It's nice, etc. 
We met that night and then I 
found 
How dearly he loved me; 
And now I'm soon to be his wife, 
How happy I 
will be. 
He whispered tales of love, and said 
" 
Don't be so timid, Miss, 
And now my little darlinv please 
Give me one little kiss." 
Srokzzr.—Of course, as we were engaged to be married, 
I 
couldwt 'efuse a 
kiss; and besides—

Since first this world created was, 
The greatest pow'r of nincl, 
Is wielded by the gentle sex, 
That lord it• o' er mankind ; 
Since Mother Eve to Adam gave, 
The first sweet taste of sin, 
The husbands and the sweethearts have 
Been always taken in. 
CHORUS. 
These charming little creatures win, 
Your heart with but a 
glance, 
You're surely to be taken in, 
If you give a 
girl the chance. 
Don't talk to a 
le of mighty deeds, 
rpon the battle field, 
Of soldiers and of statesmen great, 
Of men that would not yield, 
There never was produc'd a 
man, 
Who did so brave become, 
But that a 
girl whene' er she lik' d, 
Could twirl him round her thumb. 
CHORUS.—These charming, &e. 
A lady in the days of old, 
Did Sampson's whiskers shave, 
And Mrs. J

Did Butler's vengeance brave ; 
Miss Walker wears the pantaloon, 
Her watchword is advance, 
And each sweet girl would do the same, 
Could she but get the chance.

Fellows may be better looking, 
Richer, wiser than myself 
But I've a 
gift I 
greatly value, 
More than beauty, sense, or pelf; 
For I 
possess a 
style and manner, 
Loved by ev'ry girl I 
see, 
A flirting, teasing, pleasing way—that 
Tickles them and just suits me. 
SPOKEN.—Just my little pecuiarity, a 
style of my own that tickles 
them. 
I 
don't know what it is, you know, but there's something 
about me they like, becathe

It tickles the ladies immensely, you know! 
It tickles the ladies, wherever I 
go; 
It tickles the ladies, they like it, and so— 
They think I 
shall marry—but—oh! dear no! 
In position quite romantic 
With my hand my heart upon, 
I 
sigh, as though I'd lost the power 
Of arti-eu-la-ti-on I 
Then, in tones as low and gentle 
As a 
cooing turtle dove, 
Say—well—sOmething sentimental, 
Look—but do not speak my love. 
sposEN.—That's how it's done, this spooney business tickles them 
—and they are in no hurry for you to come to the point; they don't 
care for it to be too soon over for the longer a 
flirtation lasts, the 
more  
It tickles the ladies, etc. 
Though my heart with love may tingle, 
I 
ne'er lose my hand or head, 
For I 
know I 
must keep single, 
I 
should lose my power if wed. 
Though I 
might be still as pleasing, 
Still as youthful, fond, and gay, 
I 
should find the charm was broken 
From the fatal wedding day.

would be caged, and nobody but my better- half would admit, that—

THOUGH sad the appearance I 
make to you now, 
Well up I 
have been in my time; 
But stony and cold has the world been of late, 
And poverty still seems a 
crime. 
I 
have found out with bitter experience this: 
Without money you soon will decay, 
And those who you thought you could count as your friends, 
When wanted were always away. 
CHORUS. 
If poor you will find it a 
terrible crime, 
For poverty often offerads; 
But if you are wealthy, how different then-
For money will always find friends. 
When I 
kept a 
fine house and parties could give 
In a 
style that's been seldom before, 
Friends I 
could find in plenty, of course; 
Their numbers I 
could count by the score. 
But now if I 
meet them and ask them for help, 
With a 
shrug of the shoulder they say: 
" 
Excuse me just now ; I'll see you again 1" 
And nodding, they shuffle away. 
If poor, you will find, etc. 
Perhaps the dark cloud that's been hanging o'erhead 
Will fade, and its place become bright; 
And fortune, though fickle, will smile once again 
On this most deplorable might. 
And if out again I 
have wealth at command, 
I'll pay oack to those with a 
frown 
Who ought to have helped a 
friend when in a 
eed, 
Anu not kicked him because he was down. 
If poor, you will find. etc.

SOME people are so very fond of Newport, 
While others like to go to Cape May, 
While some prefer to go to Saratoga, 
And some at home like to stay; 
Some like to do the lakes and mountains, 
And some like to go upon the sea, 
But I 
wouldn't give a 
dollar for the lot, boys, 
Long Branch is the place for me. 
CHORUS. 
For I'm called Long Branch Joe, 
No matter where I 
go. 
I 
am a 
nobby, festive sport, 
As you can plainly see, 
As I 
promenade around 
In that famous Summer town, 
Everybody knows me 
As Long Branch Joe. 
I 
take an omelet and some coffee in the morning, 
Then I 
promenade about as I 
please, 
Then I 
call to see a 
friend down at the cottage, 
And enjoy a 
quiet smoke among the trees. 
Then I 
take a 
stroll down on the sands, boys. 
And watch the darling .ladies take a 
splash, 
Then I 
get my sorrel horse and buggy, 
To drive up and down the beach to make a 
dash. 
For I'm called, etc. 
At six o'clock I 
toddle off to dinner, 
And afterwards a 
game of billiards play, 
Then I 
flirt a 
little out on the verandah 
With a 
captivating Miss across the way; 
At nine o'clock, of course, the ball- room opens, 
And if for dancing I'm inclined to go, 
I 
always get the very best of partners, 
For the girls all like to dance with Joe. 
For I'm called, etc.

Makes the trouble small.

KEEP IT DARK, 
Sung in all the principal Variety Theaters throughout the coun-
try, with tremendous success, by HARRY MONTAGUE. 
THE sun was shining at twelve at night. 
Keep it dark! 
When this individual first came to light, 
Keep it dark! 
My mother deserted me, how could she do it ? 
My father he landed me one with his boot ; 
Sonic are brought up by hand—I 
was brought up by foot. 
Keep it dark! 
You can safely believe every tale that I 
tell, 
Keep it dark! 
For I 
never tell truth if a 
lie does as well. 
Keep it dark! 
At school my romancing got me in a 
mess, 
For I 
was so untruthful, I 
blush to confess, 
Schoolmaster advised me to write for the press. 
Keep it dark! 
The ladies wear dresses remarkably tight, 
Keep it dark! 
Their l_wautiful forms are developed to sight, 
Keep it dark 
If they took my advice, you'd certainly find 
They'd wear them much looser before than behind, 
For the very best way to bamboozle mankind. 
Keep it dark! 
I'll let you off easily, just for a 
treat, 
Keep it dark 
And I'll tell you some news the next time we meet. 
Keep it dark

A 
LITTLE way just out of town 
My aunty lives, you know; 
She has a 
thrifty little farm 
Where sometimes I 
do go. 
The house is large, the orchard fine, 
Where splendid fruit does grow, 
And I 
love tc roam amongst the trees 
With my naughty Cousin Joe. 
Naughty Cousin Joe, 
Naughty Cousin Joseph! 
Oh, go way! Don't tease me so, 
You naughty Cousin Joe. 
I'll ne'er forget on one fine day, 
When I 
was all alone, 
I 
thought I'd like to climb a 
tree 
To see how it was done. 
I 
managed somehow to get up, 
But when I 
reached the bough 
The ladder slipped, and I 
was left 
In a 
pretty plight, I 
vow! 
SPOKEN.— And then I 
commenced to scream for— 
Naughty Cousin Joe, etc. 
How Joe did laugh to see me then, 
And how I 
blushed, I 
know, 
For what a 
fool I 
must have looked 
As Joe stood there below! 
However, he soon got me down, 
And no more I'll climb a 
tree; 
And many a 
day I'll recollect 
The kiss that Joe gave me.

YOUNG Agues, beauteous flower, 
Sweet as blooming May, 
One evening from her tower 
Thus pour'd her tender lay : 
The night now bath spread its shade, 
And ' twill hide thee from all ; 
Then haste to thy faithful maid, 
Darkness veils bow'r and all? 
Oh, baste beneath her tower! 
Dost thou not hear her love's call? 
The silent hour invites thee. 
No star sheds its ray; 
No danger, love, affrights thee,— 
Wherfore, then, dost thou stay? 
When sunbeams illumine the sky, 
Guardians then may appal, 
But now closed is ev'ry eye ;— 
Let thy steps gently fall,— 
The silent hour invites thee; 
Dost thou not hear love's call ?

When I 
was r, boy, a 
mischievous elf. 
I'd a 
very bad habi ot'helping myself: 
My mothei put everything out of my way, 
And well I 
remember these words she would say:

You may look, but you musn't touch,

You're inclined to be a

Now don't be so rude. 
At eight years of age, although not a 
fool, 
I 
went every day, of course, to my school. 
I 
romped with the girls, and would not let them be, 
So the school teacher gave the old lecture to me: 
You may look, etc. 
When I 
grew a 
young man, I 
loved a 
sweet maid, 
And although she loved me, she was rather too

dared not embrace Ler, or ask for a

did, the reply from my love would be this:

I'm a 
victim of fate, now my woes I'll relate, 
You'll really be sorry for me, 
For when sorrow I 
sup, next day 
get up, 
Then I

Some folks take their ills, one by one, just like pills, 
But I 
usually swallow the box. 
First it rains, then it pours misfortunes by scores, 
And calamities follow in flocks.

Still they come, still they come— 
Troubles and bothers, one after the other, 
Still they come, still they come— 
There's nothing but trouble for me. 
I 
wish I'd been dead on the day I 
got wed, 
'Twould have saved me a 
terrible life, 
For nobody knows what I 
could disclose 
Concerning the friends of my wife— 
There's my mother in-law, and her sisters a 
score, 
And relations a 
wonderful share. 
They come, and they stay, and they won't go away 
For no matter bow..mlny are there. 
Still they come, still they come— 
Uncles and cousins, and aunts by the dozen. 
Still they come, still they come— 
Boarding and lodging with me.

once thought I'd enjy, a 
sweet baby boy. 
To cheer me, and cause me delight. 
I 
didn't mind two, and with four I 
could do, 
And I 
thought' that with six I 
was right : 
I 
put up with my fate when the number was eight, 
But the tenth brought me sorrow and woe, 
For now she begins—just think ! to have twins, 
Although I 
may try all I 
know.

'Twas going to the Central Park, 
To take the country air, 
And see the fishes and the swans, 
And other sights so rare, 
I 
met a 
pair of roguish eyes, 
That pierced me through and through, 
And made me feel so very queer, 
I 
scarce knew what to do. 
CHORUS. 
She was all the heart could fancy, 
And lovely as a 
queen, 
And just about the gayest of the gay ; 
And it was her pair of roguish eyes, 
That pierced me thro' and thro' and thro' 
And charmed my heart and senses all away. 
(Dance.) 
Her dress was made in the latest style, 
And trimmed with charming taste, 
She wore a 
brilliant necklace, too, 
Of diamonds—made of paste; 
Her golden hair in ringlets fell, 
Around her lovely neck, 
And since her charming face I've seen, 
My heart's a 
perfect wreck.

A cook in Grosvenor Square,

Who'd about his face much hair. 
His eyes they were of a

'Tis as well to tell to you, 
With a

On his collar there was a 
number plac'd, 
On his arm there was a 
band, 
And as he walk'd with a 
stately step, 
No one looked half so grand. 
The little boys with their kites and hoops, 
From him like wild fire flew, 
While cookey would hand up the mutton chops, 
To tins young chap dress'd in blue. 
He was a

The magistrate committed him, 
The cookey lost her place ; 
Bat the cabby shortly married her, 
To Liver her disgrace;

I 
met my cousin Joe, 
He ask, d 
me then if I 
wI h

To the Central Park would go. 
With my consent we then did start, 
And reached th lake at three, 
We took a 
sail, and words of love 
Were pass'd by Joe and me. 
Cuortus. 
Sailing on the lake, 
To the music of the birds, 
The rippling of the waters 
And the sound of loving words. 
On our return we took a 
stroll, 
And soon did reach the mall. 
When from the distance music sweet 
Upon our ears did fall. 
We sat and listened to the band, 
Beneath a 
hawthorn tree, 
While gentle breezes carried words 
Of love from Joe to me. 
Chorus.—Sailing on the lake, ice. 
Now Joe has asked me to be his, 
Of course I 
won't refuse, 
And Pa has given his consent— 
This chance I 
must not ,00se. 
And w en some day at Central Park 
The lake you g to see, 
I 
know you'll whisper words of love 
Like my dear Joe and me.

Dedicated to my friend HARRY BRNNETT. 
You have all heard the song of Pull down the blind, 
But another I'll sing just as good, you will find ; 
Now, Wipe off your chin, I 
believe is the last, 
But I 
have one still later, ' tis Turn down the gas ! 
Now, I 
loved a 
young man so charming and gay, 
Who came round to see me most every day • 
When we'd kiss and embrace, to me he would say— 
Turn down the gas! Turn it down right away! 
SPOKEN.—Yes, he was a 
darling fellow ; whenever he 
came to my house to see me, it was always when Pa and 
Ma were gone to meeting; he would put his arm round 
my neck and say, Jennie, darling— 
CHORUB. 
Turn down the gas! Turn down the gas! 
Darken the room, love, there's a 
dear lass : 
Though we love each other, remarks may be pass'd, 
So come kiss your Harry and—Turn down the gas! 
My Harry's a 
darling, you can see at a 
glance, 
And don't he look sweet in his new lavender pants ; 
He sings like a 
bird, and oh! can't he dance! 
If you saw him waltzing why you'd go in a 
trance, 
For such style as his was never seen yet— 
He's King of the Fashion, now don't you forget. 
We are going to be married, and I'll never regret 
When I 
turned down the gas for my dear darling pet. 
SPOKEN.—Harry and I 
have been keeping company for 
over a 
year, and mother says it's time he proposed. 
I 
think so too. 
He says he will marry inc before the Cen-
tennial is over. 
At any rate, I 
hope he loves me just as 
well as when he first courted me, and with a loving 
squeeze told me to please— 
Turn down the gas !" S:c. 
Song and Dance as rerformed by HARPER & STANSILL. 
TWAS a 
Saturda3. afternoon, as down the street I 
went, 
I 
passed a 
damsel who was fair; 
And as she glided by, I 
was stilled by the scent 
That came from her glossy, curly hair. 
She wore a 
gaiter boot, the size was number three, 
Which attracted my attention for awhile; 
And when she saw me looking, she tossed her curls at me, 
And also cast a 
most bewitching smile. 
CHORUS. 
Yes, she tossed her curls at me in a 
manner that was free, 
Did this pretty little damsel so fair. 
I 
shall Wei• forget that foot, nor that natty little boot, 
Belonging to the girl with the glossy hair. 
I 
watched her around the corner, ' till she was out of sight, 
Then waited near the crossing for a 
car; 
kl when I 
took my seat, I 
noticed to the right 
le little one conversing with her pa. 
PW she had been shopping, by the bundles that she had, 
it what they contained I 
could'nt see; 
when she reached her home she passed them to her pa, 
Then with a 
smile, she tossed her curls at me. 
yes, she tossed her curls, Jrc. 
As I 
Strolled Along the East River, 
As sung by Miss ELLA. W ESNER. 
One Saturday, just for a 
change, 
I 
thought I'd take a 
walk, 
Along the East River, 
Now of New York all the talk, 
When a 
pretty girl accosted me, 
Oh pardon me, I 
pray, 
But I 
want to go to Brooklyn Bridge, 
Please Sir, which is the way?" 
CHORUS. 
As I 
stroll'd along the East River, 
Wasn't it a 
jolly spree ; 
As I 
stroll'd along the East River, 
This pretty, pretty girl enchanted me. 
On saying this she smiled a 
bit 
And gave a 
quiet " hem ;" 
For a 
second I 
was taken back, 
For she was a 
perfect gem; 
But I 
replied, and instantly, 
It wasn't far away, 
And by her leave, I'd show her there 
Without the least delay. 
As I 
stroll'd, 
I 
proffered and she took my arm, 
Which I 
thought would be refused, 
• 
I'll have your Gal," the urchins cried, 
At which I 
felt amused ; 
For she really was a 
sort of girls 
You don't meet every day; 
6he seemed to cast a 
spell on me 
I 
eould Dot throw away. 
She told me as we walked along, 
" 
That her name was Mary Bell," 
And said, besides, 
she knew my Ma, 
And hoped she was quite well. 
But when she said, " your name is Brown. 
And 3
-ou live near Pannapo, N. J.) 
I 
thought I'd picked up -with a \vi.elt 
Or else how could she know.

I 
taxed my memory as to where 
I'd seen ner iace before, 
But was aroused—as old St, John 
Chimed out the 
ur of four ; 
Said she, .‘ oh laws ! I 
must be off 
For I'm ten minutes late ; 
Take this address and call on me. 
To-morrow night at eight." 
As I 
stroWd, 
Now to cut my little story short, 
Also my hopes and joys, 
I 
called and found she was a 
wife— 
With two bonny girls and boys 
And her husband was a 
lighterman. 
Upon the Noeth and East River tiy names 
For once, done brown, was Brown, by one 
Of nature's purest gems.

As I

Wasn't it a 
jolly, jolly spr,.e

Sung with great success in the principal Variety Theaters 
throughout the country by the DuxcAN SISTERS, 
CARRIE AND SOPHIE. 
THE subject of the songs to- day 
" 
Violets Dipped in Dew," 
And " Take, Oh take those Lips Away," 
And " Laughing Eyes so Blue." 
I 
know these songs are just the thing 
To please and bring us joys, 
But what I 
now intend to sing 
is " Just to Please the Boys." 
Just to please the boys, 
Just to please the boys 
I've made my mind, and feel inclined 
To try and please the boys. 
To all young men who seek a 
wife, 
Before they are betrayed, 
I'd gladly give some good advic-
For beauty soon will fade. 
Don't fall in love with all you see, 
Pure gold has no alloy; 
Their winning smiles, you must agree. 
Is just to please the boys. 
Just to please the boys, etc. 
Some girls you see upon the street 
Are but a 
fleeting show; 
Don't cast your fond hearts at their feet, 
They're not all pure as snow. 
And now, young men, I 
hope you'll learn 
To shun the world's decoys, 
And recollect that what I've said 
Was just to please the boys. 
Just to please the boys, etc.

HUMAN NATURE. 
Sung with great success, by the immensely popular Vocal 
Comedian, HARRY MorrAGuE. 
(Music of this or of any of TIARRY MONTAGUE'S compositions, can 
can be obtained from SPEAR & DEIINIIOFF, 717 Broad— 
way, N. Y.) 
Oh, here's a 
shocking sample of poor humanity, 
Now take a 
sad example from the specimen you See . 
And always satisfy yourself with what belongs to you, 
And don't go coveting another man's wife, or another man's 
darling Lou. 
SPOKEN. —
Lou—Louisa—now you see I'm in love with Lou, 
but I•have no right to be, for I'm married; but I 
always want 
what I 
ea) t 
get, and I 
generally get what I 
don't want, but 
we're all alike, for— 
Cnoaus. 
It's only human nature after all, 
r 
really cannot help myself at all 
It's only human nature, fickle human nature, 
I'ts only human nature after all. 
Louisa is proud and haughty, while I'm of low degree ; 
She's on the shady side of forty, while I 
am twenty-three. 
Louisa she has heaps of cash, while I'm not worth a 
son, 
So you may guess there isn't a 
chance for a 
fellow to be loved 
by Lou. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, Louisa has got plenty of money. 
Now I 
sup-
pose that if Lou was my wife, and my wife was Lou, that I'd 
_ 
fall in love with my own wife; but we're both married, that is, 
I 
am married and so is Louisa, but, unfortunately we aro mar-
ried to the wrong people. 
Well— 
It's only human, etc. 
My wife is such a 
tartar, and she leads me such a 
life, 
I 
wish that I 
could " shake " her, and say Ta-Ta to my wife, 
For an aggravating one is she, with such a 
temper too, 
And you can bet there'd be a 
row, if she knew that I 
loved 
,SPOKEN.—Well if my wife knew that I 
loved Lou, she':, 
lope her temper, and Lou would lose her back hair, see? for— 
It's only human, etc. 
Oh human nature fickle, it seems to be your plan 
To lead into a 
pickle every discontented man. 
You make us think we want a 
lot, that we've not had before, 
And then when'eer our desires we've got, we're in trouble till 
we get some more. 
SPOKEN.—Ycs, it's the same all over the world, the More we 
get the more we want, for— 
It's only human, etc.

method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have

Courting Cards.— This Series of Cards has been arranged 
V. meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too dim. 
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unlady-like encourage-
ment. As a 
result a 
this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. This pack of Cards will overcome the dia. 
oulty, and being in the shape of qiiastions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes further explanation u.n. 
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two player., 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties  .
