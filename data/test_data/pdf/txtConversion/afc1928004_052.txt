A Smile Was All She Gave Me. 
Written by Bobby Newcomb. 
Not long ago I 
was the bean 
Of a 
pretty girl named Mary— 
Whose face so sweet and a 
style so neat, 
And a 
step just like a 
fairy. 
We courted long, our love was strong, 
How I 
wished -that she would have me 
But when I 
did the question pop, 
A 
smile was all he gave me. 
CHORUS_ 
And she was so lair I 
do declare, 
How I 
wish that she would have me, 
But when I 
did the question pop, 
A smile was all she gave me. 
I 
sent her notes, I 
sent her 'flowers, 
I 
took her out a-riding— 
How quick time flies when love and sighs, 
Are with the hours gliding. 
A rival was my only fear, 
And I 
couldn't think to save me, 
That when I 
asked her who he was, 
A smile was all she gave me— 
And she was, &c. 
Rebels and Tories; Or, the Blood of the Mohawk. 
The friends and enemies of independence shown in truo colors.

note I 
got one day, 
And dreadful news it carried, 
Inviting me to come and see, 
Herself and rival married. 
Now off I 
went, on death was bent, 
Resolved that none should save me— 
But I 
am not dead though she.got wed, 
And a

courted a 
girl not long ago, I 
thought she was my 
dear, 
She took my gifts and then told. me to walk off on 
my ear— 
She called me every kind of names; with rage I 
could have killed her, 
I 
like to know just what she meant when she called 
me a " Flutergilder." 
Oh now a-days, &c. 
The other day, upon Broadway, I 
was dressed to 
suit a 
queen, 
When a 
sassy little boy he says " there goes a

sees it 
They are sure to holler in your ear, I

Our Russian Possessions, a 
big thing in Ice— 
To go there in summer it will be very nice— 
There's many great sights out there to be seen— 
We'll soon drop the water and go there by steam— 
Raise our own Bear's Oil and lots of Ice Cream— 
Really it makes me smile. 
Since Dickens arrived he's been all ,the rage, 
To take back the Dollars a

And when for Old England he crosses the main 
And tells what a

He'll set Martin Chuzzlewhit talking again. 
Really it makes me smile. 
As one day I 
promenaded, it was in the afternocn. 
At the crossing of the walk I 
met a 
charming gay 
quadroon. 
She looked at me so swe etly, my heart went pit-a-
pat— 
I 
never can forget those eyes, beneath Ler little 
hat. 
Her dress was in the fashion cut, and fitted her to 
trim. 
But to describe her many charms I never can 
begin, oh, 
She caused a 
great sensation, and I

Oh the next time that I met her at Delmonico's 
Saloon, 
I 
sought—an introduction to the charming Gay 
Quadroon. 
We talked of love and poets, our hearts with joy 
I 
asked her then that very night with me to link 
her fate. 
She said that I 
might call on her, in a 
voice so soft 
and low, 
She pressed her ruby lips to mine and in the 
house did go, oh; 
That kiss I 
can't forget it; if I 
do, it won't be soon. 
That kiss so sweet it lingers yet, 
My charming Gay Quadroon. 
Oh her house I 
next did visit, lier Pa and Ma were 
home— 
She introduced me to her folks, but I 
wished to 
be alone, 
Her Pa he asked my station, how much a 
week I 
got— 
I 
told him I 
was wealthy and I 
owned a 
house 
and lot. 
S3 now I'm going to marry her, to my sweetness I'm 
engaged— 
But when her Pa finds out the truth, why won't 
he be enraged, oh! 
But I 
trust that he'll forgive me, at least I 
hope 
quite soon, 
So now adieux for I

The Big Sun-Flower." 
Written by Bobby Newcomb. 
There is a 
charm I 
can't explain 
About a 
girl I've seen, 
And my heart beats fast when she goes past 
In a 
dark dress trimmed with green. 
Her eyes are bright as evening stars, 
So lovely and. so shy, 
And the folks all stop and look around 
Whenever she goes by. • 
CHORUS. 
And I 
feel just as happy as a 
big Sun-flower 
That nods and. bends in the breezes, 
And my heart is as light as the wind that blows 
The leaves from off the treeses. 
As time passed on and we became 
Like friends of olden time, 
I 
thought the question I 
would pop 
And. ask her to be mine. 
But the answer I 
received next day, 
How could she treat me so, 
For instead. of being mine for life, 
She simply answered. No! 
And I 
feel, &c. 
I 
called next day dressed in my best, 
My- fair one for to see, 
And ask her if she would explain 
Why she had jilted. me. 
She said she really felt quite sad, 
To cause me such distress, 
And. when I 
said, now do be mine, 
Why of course she answered, yes. 
And. I

Shadows on the Blind. 
Written by Bobby Newcomb. 
I 
will tell a 
little mishap which I 
met the other 
night, 
While the stars they were a 
peeping and the moon 
was shining bright. 
I 
was sitting in my parlor some pleasure trying to 
find, 
When my eyes they were attracted to a 
Shadow on 
the Blind..

So listen while I'm dancing and bright eyes they 
are glancing 
For love it has so many tales—and in this life you'll 
find. 
Some fun you'll oft discover watching Shadows on 
the Blind. 
That day I'd been out walking, a 
girl by chance 
had seen, 
Whose manner was so charming she was graceful 
as a 
Queen. 
In a 
crowd. by chance I 
lost her, but she still was in 
my mind, 
And I 
thought that she resembled the Shadow on 
the Blind. 
So listen, &c. 
I 
could not sit and wonder, to the window I 
did run 
In hopes of surely seeing my charming little one. 
But judge of my poor feelings, for instead, why I 
did find 
An old woman selling onions making Shadows on 
my Blind.

Air :— " 
History of the World." 
A friend I 
met the other day, 
Who is somewhat of a 
chum; 
And when I 
asked him how things went, 
He said, A No. 1. 
At least ails well except my farm, 
On that I've had bad luck, 
For all my sheep you know, the flock 
Have been by lightning struck. 
"Indeed," I 
said, " that's dreadful bad." 
" 
Oh, no," he said, it's not, 
For I 
sold the hides and made more cash 
Than I 
paid out for the lot." 
" 
Ah ! ah !" I 
says, " that's very good ;" 
He said, " it is not so, 
For I 
planted corn with the money I 
got, 
And not an ear would grow." 
"Dear me, how bad," I 
said ; " old friend, 
I'd thought you'd gone insane." 
" 
Oh, no," he said, " I'll show you now 
How bad luck was my gain 
In digging up the useless roots 
I 
bored down in the soil, 
And was rewarded for my pains 
By finding I'd struck oil." 
With joyous face I 
said, " my friend, 
For you I'm really glad," 
" 
Oh, no," he said, " it was no good 
To me, 'twas awful bad." 
" 
Pray tell," I 
said, " what was 
The next reverse you met in life," 
" 
Why through my wealth, I'm sorry to say 
I 
married a 
very bad wife."

Song and Dance by Bobby Newcomb. 
I 
love a 
little damsel with a 
pretty little face, 
And she's jumped in my affections—in my heart 
she's stole a 
place— 
She dresses neat and. stylish, the men they sigh and 
stare, 
She knows they're dead in love with her and yet 
she does'nt care. 
For I'm the one she fancies, tho' you may not think 
it true. 
But if you knew our meeting place you'd often see 
us two. 
I'm sure we love each other and I'm her only beau. 
We've got a 
little trysting place— 
And would'nt' you like to know ?

For the girls they are so very fascinating 
Our affections they are always captivating, 
With their flirting and their pouting they deceive 
you, 
But really this is not the case with me. 
Her father he's an artist, her mother takes in clothes, 
While my handsome little charmer, to help along, 
she sews. 
I 
go down to her mansion, I 
sit and hold the thread, 
And over that there's many a 
kiss and loving word 
been said.

So I'll be with the throng, 
A circumstance I 
will relate, 
And tell it in my song— 
Of a 
nice young girl that I 
once met, 
Like Juno was her height. 
And I 
told her that I 
loved her there, 
Under the gaslight. 
Oh full in fashion she was dressed, 
I 
think she was a 
blonde.

Her eyes were blue and a 
gaze she threw, 
So loving and so fond— 
I 
asked her please to see her home, 
I 
loved her at first sight. 
She answered, " Yes, dear, come along," 
Under the gaslight— 
Of course I 
asked her where she lived, 
She said " it was not far— 
And said a 
brother she had got, 
And a 
Papa and Mama," 
When all at once some chap come up, 
And wished with me to fight, 
For talking to his wife, he said, 
Under the gaslight. 
Apologise I 
did at once, 
It only made him swear— 
When I 
offered him fifty dollars, 
If he would call it square— 
He answered yes; for my purse I 
felt, 
But found it had took flight— 
, 
And I 
was minas all my change, 
Under the gaslight. 
Now when I 
told him how it was, 
IIe laughed and said, " played out," 
And if I 
didn't soon force up, 
he'd paste me in the snout. 
I 
called police, of course none came, 
There wasn't one in sight— 
So I 
got kicked and knocked about, 
Under the gaslight. 
Of course a 
crowd soon gathered round; 
The guilty pair they fled, 
And in the gutter I 
was found, 
Scarce living and half dead, 
They dragged me off to the station house, 
They said for being tight, 
And acting like a 
precious fiat, 
Under the gaslight.

Oh we all do like the pretty girls, we see them day

And, how at first sight fall in love when e'er they 
pass our way.

charming girl the other morn I 
saw come

But as I 
looked my fate was booked, I 
sealed it 
with a 
sigh. 
I 
found that I 
had got in love with her Dark and 
Roguish Eye. 
Her dress was in the latest style, looped up so gay 
and neat, 
And as she stepped across the road, I 
saw her pretty 
feet. 
By chance she dropped her handkerchief; 'twas 
marked 1,-11-C-1
--
As I 
gave it back she thanked me with her Dark 
and Rolling Eye. 
But I

Of course the little chance I 
took, we walked and 
talked awhile, 
She said her father he was rich he lately had Struck

The subject of my little song, 
Is one I

It supports our Constitution, 
And it will for many a

There's no disease but What's been cured 
By Bass's " Bitter Beer."

And drank its mountain dew,

But give to me a

Of Bass's " Bitter Beer."

When Ireland was founded by the Mac's and the O's 
I 
never could learn: for, nobody knows; 
But history says they came over from Spain 
To visit Old G-ranua, and there to remain. 
Our Fathers were heroes—for wisdom and. fame: 
For multiplication they practised the same. 
St. Patrick came over to heal their complaints, 
And very soon made them an island of Saints. 
The Harp and the Shamrock were carried before 
Brave Roderick O'Connor and Roger O'More: 
And the good and bad deeds of the Mac's and the O's, 
And this is the tale that these verses disclose.

Then, oh! then, remember me!

'Twos a

When the trout leaps quickest to snap the fly— 
And they match'd with your golden hair, my 
pet. 
Your lips—but I 
have no words, Janette, 
They were fresh as the twitter of birds, my pet, 
When the spring is young, and the roses are wet 
With dew-drops in each red bosom set, 
And they suited your gold brown hair, my pet. 
You tangled my life in your hair, Janette, 
'Twas a 
silken and golden snare, my pet, 
But, so gently the bondage, my soul did implore 
The right to continue thy slave evermore, 
With my fingers enmesh'd in your hair, my pet. 
Thus ever I 
dream what you were, Janette, 
With your lips, and your eyes, and your hair, my pet; 
In the darkness of desolate years I 
moan, 
And my tears fall bitterly over the stone, 
That covers your beautiful hair, my pet.

" What You Can Get For a Dollar." 
Written by Bobby Newcomb. 
Air :—" Mrs. Mc Laughlin's Party." 
The wonderful times that we live in, 
Set other big nations a 
staring, 
To see us so soon after trouble, 
As well as the rest of them faring— 
But the latest sensation's that started 
As after each other they follow, 
To see advertised in the papers, 
"How much you can get for a 
Dollar." 
The gift enterprizes, (A bubble 
Goes bursting one after the other) 
Though seeking the cloak of good doers, 
Their swindling intentions to cover— 
I 
think it near time that such fellows, 
Whose honest men's money they swallow. 
Should be made to make promises good of, 
"How much they would give for a 
Dollar." 
The Mysterious Foundling; Or, the Gamester's fate. 
Shows in a 
striking mancer the terrible results of gambling.

As things they are now getting cheaper, 
Why money it should be invested, 
For where you get value received, 
You never can say you were bested. 
There's a 
store on Broadway that I 
go in, 
For cheapness it beats others hollow, 
With the smiles of the beautiful clerks,. 
I'm sure what you get's worth a 
Dollar. 
I 
know a 
young feller, named Sammy, 
Who writes other people's name— Clever, 
And said he could do it so good, 
That nobody could catch him ever. 
But lately he tried counterfeiting, 
When a 
policeman grabbed him by the collar, 
So checquers he plays with his nose, 
They gave him Ten Years for a 
Dollar.

Music by II. P. Danks. 
Angel of beauty, all lovely and bright, 
Be with my spirit by day and by night, 
Though I 
may roam o'er the land or the deep, 
Ever above me thy loving watch keep; 
Let thy bright beauty beam over me here, 
Let thy pure presence be lovingly near, 
Angel of beauty, bright, sing to my soul to-night, 
Tell me of happy days, in thy sweet lays. 
Come when my spirit it is lightsome and glad, 
Come when my spirit it is lonely and sad; 
Come to my soul with thy soft winning lays, 
Telling of brighter and happier days; 
Tenderly leading my spirit above, 
Angel of beauty, and angel of love, 
Come with thy music sweet, gently my soul tc greet, 
Singing sweet seraph strains, in soft refrains.

Words by Geo. W. Elliott. 
Music by II. P. Danks. 
I 
gaze upon those beaming eyes, 
That sparkled one with heavenly blue, ' 
Then seemed to mount the vaulted skies, 
And find a 
spirit form in view; 
Those robes eclipse the roseate light, 
The sun enfolds about his car; 
Her radiant glances awe to flight, 
The gleam that gilds the evening star; 
And so sublime the vision seems, 
I'm lost awhile in heavenly dreams. 
CH0RUS. 
Her darling image while I 
gaze 
Brings back the ioys of other days— 
Those sparkling eyes of heavenly blue, 
Those beaming eyes of Katy Drew. 
Dear memory softly near me steals, 
And lifts the veil of golden haze, 
While fancy's mimic force reveals, 
The treasured scenes of boyhood days; 
Those beaming eyes there lends a 
light, 
That ehastly decks a 
charming form; 
Her tres es dark as plumes of night, 
Her cheeks with rival roses warm; 
Her voice the blissful soul of song ; 
Herself a 
queen to sway the throng. 
Her darling image, &c. 
Once more I 
trace those beaming eyes, 
To where a happy spirit band, 
With rapture fills the vaulted skies, 
With notes of song supremely grand; 
Some strains I 
hear of heavenly lays, 
The Serf; Or, Love Levels All. 
A thrilling story, founded on Tom Tylor's celebrated play.

Beside thy grave I

Beside thy grave I

And tears are showing, showing thee, 
The anguish, the anguish that I 
feel. 
Tho' years, though years have passed away, 
Mother, since you and I 
did part 
I 
held your memory fresh and green, 
Entwined, entwined, around my heart. 
Entwined, entwined, around my heart. 
CHORUS. 
Entwined around my heart, Mother, 
Around my heart entwined, 
Thy memory ever clings to me, 
Like ivy, like ivy to the vine. 
The tears spring in my eye, Mother, 
The tears spring in my eye, 
To think that I 
was far away. 
And did not, and did not see thee die, 
I 
roamed, I 
roamed, through foreign clime.s,

And thoughts, sweet thoughts of thee,

Twas Under a Gas-Light I Met Her. 
Words and music by Frank Howard. 
'Twas under a 
gas-light I 
met her, 
Its glare a 
sweet face did reveal, 
Although I've cause to forget her, 
My feelings I 
cannot conceal, 
A neat little foot in a 
slipper, 
Her fingers so taper and small, 
A waterfall shaped like a 
dipper, 
In form she could just beat them all—oh! 
CHORUS. 
Under a 
gas-light I 
met her, 
• 
Quite late on a 
summer's day eve, 
But soon I 
was taught to forget her, 
She sold me you'd better believe. 
Oh! never to my recollection, 
Had I 
in my life till that night, 
Ere met such a 
pink of perfection, 
So modest, genteel and polite. 
I 
timidly asked for the pleasure, 
Of seeing her safely at home, 
She sweetly said yes! the dear creature 
It made my heart thump like a 
stone—oh! 
Under a 
gaslight, & c. 
We kept up a 
lively flirtation, 
Until we arrived at her door, 
I 
asked with love-sick animation, 
If I 
could but see her once more. 
I 
think of it now and feel mellow,

She answered with such a 
sly leer.

fellow

Composed by IT. P. Hanks. As sung by Mr. Charles Henry. 
In beauty shone the moon last night 
O'er woodland, stream, and fell, 
As I 
wandered by the streamlet's side, 
That murmurs through the dell. 
I 
stood beside the little grave, 
Beneath the elm trees shade, 
Where sleeps the loved one of my heart, 
My darling Nettie's laid. 
CHORUS. 
Sleep, darling Nettie, sleep, 
I 
hear thy voice no more; 
And now my lonely watch I 
keep, 
O'er the grave of Nettie Lenore. 
The little brook is dear to me, 
Since Nettie is no more, 
But dearer far the old elm tree, 
That stands upon the shore. 
For there at eve we used to come, 
And talk of days long flown, 
But now she's sleeping in the grave, 
And. I 
am left alone. 
Sleep, darling Nettie, &c. 
The summer days grow longer still, 
As by the brook I 
roam, 
And muse upon the loved and lost, 
From out our pleasant home.

I 
too, beneath the old elm tree, 
With Nettie, dear, may rest.

I've been waiting, darling, waiting 
Since youth's bright golden years; 
But the joys of life are fading, 
With blighted hopes and fears; 
Life's sweet pleasures fast are passing, 
Hearts affections still are free,— 
Down the stream of life I'm gliding 
Waiting, dear, waiting for thee r

'Twas my promise when we parted. 
Ever true to be, 
Although now broken-hearted, 
Waiting still, waiting for thee.

Where the bramble rose is creeping 
With wild forget-me-not; 
Where the rippling brook is flowing, 
With murmuring melody,— 
On its mossy bank I'm kneeling, 
Waiting dear, waiting for thee! 
'Twas my promise, &c. 
I've been waiting, darling, waiting, 
Through years of care and pain, 
While my heart is sad with watching 
Per thy return again; 
But my promise will be sacred, 
Tho' I 
trust I 
soon may be, 
By our Saviour with the blessed, 
Waiting, dear, waiting for thee!

The Willow Spring. 
As the day was slowly fading 
In the rosy west, 
And the birds were gently warbling 
Vespers from each nest, 
Underneath the gloomy lindens, 
half-way down the shady lane, 
Sad and lonely wept a 
maiden, 
Murmuring this refrain: 
Daylight dies and starry nightfall comes, 
But Fin weeping while I 
sing, 
Of the happy days we passed, love, 
By the willow spring. 
In the hours that once were beaming 
With love's radiant light, 
She had stood beneath the lindens, 
Joyous, hopeful, bright; 
Now when sorrow's icy fingers 
Touched her weary heart and brain, 
Memory found but one expression, 
In this sad refrain: 
Daylight dies, tkc.

in town.

Oh! on the 25th of May, oh, dear I

0, my heart is palpitating, 
While the kindness I'm relating, 
Of Thomas Brown, my bosom friend. 
I 
thought that Vother Thomas Brown would be, 
without a 
doubt, 
Annoyed because with Sarah Jones I'd slyly cut 
him out; 
But no! he said he'd be best man, and firmly my 
hand shook, 
And to make the little arrangements, for my wedding 
undertook. 
Oh! on the 25th of May, &c. 
He got the license for me, and bespoke the coaches 
too, 
The wedding breakfast ordered, then invited all I 
knew, 
And as my business kept me from my Sarah late at 
eve, 
He kindly shopping went with her—such friendship, 
who'd believe ? 
Oh! on the 25th of May, &c. 
When the morning came I 
could not rest, I 
feared 
to be too late; 
By eleven I'd to be at church, but was up and

came and past, 
Still Tom did not return, therefore I

to blame; •

The Child and The Dew-Drops. 
Oh! father, dear father, why pass they away, 
The dew-drops that sparkled at dawning of day— 
That glittered like stars by the light of the moon, 
Oh! why are those dew-drops dissolving so soon I) 
Does the sun, in his wrath, chase their brightness 
away, 
As though nothing that's lovely might live for a 
day ? 
The moonlight has faded—the flowers still remain, 
But the dew is dried out of their petals again.' 
'Ikry child,' said the father, 
look up to the skies, 
Behold yon bright rainbow, those beautiful dyes; 
There—there are the dew-drops in glory reset, 
Mid the jewels of heaven they are glittering yet. 
Then are we not taught by each beautiful ray 
To mourn not for beauty, though fleeting away ? 
For though youth of its brightness and beauty be 
riven, 
All that withers on earth blooms more brightly in 
heaven.' 
Alas! for the father—how little he knew 
The words be had spoken prophetic could be: 
That the beautiful child— the bright star of his day— 
Was e'en then like the dew-drops, dissolving away, 
Oh! sad was the father, when lo! in the skies, 
The rainbow again spread its glorious dyes! 
And then . 
he remembered the maxims he'd given, 
And thought of his child, and the dew-drops—in 
heaven.

'Written by Oliver Wendell IIolmes. 
Sung by the Great Ling,ard. 
There was a 
pensive oysterman liv'd by the river 
His hut was built upon the bank., his boat was on

The daughter of a 
fisherman, who was both tall and 
slim, 
Liv'd over on the other side, right opposite to him.

lovely

Up jumped this pensive oysterman, and to himself 
said he, 
" 
I'd better leave my skiff behind, for fear that folks 
should see ; 
I've read it in a 
story book, that for to kiss his dear, 
Leander swam the Hellespont, and I 
will swim this 
here." 
Ri tol, &c. 
He jumped into the water and quickly crossed the 
stream, 
And then he clambered up the rocks, all in the 
moon's pale beam ; 
The moon that moment shone out bright—to be 
sure it was a 
sin, 
For then he heard her daddy's step, and he popped 
in again. 
Ri tol, &c. 
Out spoke this aged fisherman, " Oh, what is that, 
my daughter ?" 
" 
It's nothing but a 
brickbat, sir, that I 
flung in the 
water!"

o'er so fast ?"

Run," said the ancient fisherman, " and fetch me 
my harpoon, 
And I 
will jump into my boat, and fix the fellow

Her hair hung round her pallid cheeks like seaweed

Lovely child, fair and pure,

Though her charms would allure; 
Where the rivulet darts,

Must have loved her, I

For her chosen was by, 
And so happy were they, - 
That they heard not my sigh.

Fell to weeping such tears as we weep at nineteen!

So I 
went to see my sweetheart, 
As I'd nothing else to do. 
Off I 
started through the meadows, 
Where the dcw-beads pearl'd the spray, 
And responsive to the g)ng birds, 
I 
kept singing all the way; 
Quite surprised she was to see me 
Come so curly there to woo, 
Till I 
said rd just walked over 
'Cause rd nothing else to do. 
Then we rambled forth together, 
Down the lane beneath the trees, 
While so gently stirred the shadows 
Of their branches in the breeze; 
And wherieer our conversation 
Languished for a 
word or two, 
Why, ci course. I 
kindly kissed her, 
As I'd nothing else to do. 
But before the day was over, 
I'd somehow made up my mind. 
That I'd pop the qnestion to her, 
If to me her heart inclined; 
So I 
whispered sweet, " My darling; 
Will you have me, Yes, or No ?" 
" 
Well," said she, " perhaps / may, my dear, 
When I'd. nothing else to do" 
My Old: Wife and I. 
I 
merrily sing from morn till 
And misery I 
defy, 
And I've, a 
wife, who with delight,, 
Sings just as happy as I, 
She is the comfort of my life, 
My darling, and my pride,

Like shooting the rapids—so swiftly do events transpire.

For twenty years together, my boys, 
We've travell'd it side by side. 
CHORUS. 
Round go 
ts the wheel, 
Trouble I 
defy, 
Joc,ging, along together, my boys, 
y 
dear old wife and I. 
When homeward I'm returning, 
She'll greet me with a 
smile, 
Her dear old face beams with delight, 
In such a 
happy style. 
" 
Sit down by the fireside," 
She'll say, " and take your tea," 
She laughs, and jokes on t'other side, 
A 
picture, boys, to see. 
Round goes the wheel, ikc.. 
In winter when the snow is down, 
She'll meet me at the door, 
With " Come in lad, and warm yourself, 
You must be cold I'm sure" 
She brings my slippers, warm and dry, 
And lays them by my side, 
I 
never could find her equal, though 
I 
search'd the world so wide. 
Round goes the wheel, &e. 
I 
smoke my pipe, and sing my song, 
Content to stay at home, 
As happy as the day is long, 
And ne'er inclined to roam; 
There's many talk of single bliss, 
And for their freedom sigh, 
But that will never be the case, 
With my old wife and I.

Bobby Newcomb's 
Little Maggie May. 
The spring had come, the flowers in bloom, 
The birds sung out their lay, 
Down by a 
little running brook, 
I 
first saw Maggie May. 
She had a 
roguish jet-black eye, 
Was singing all the day; 
And how I 
ley'd her, none can tell, 
My little Maggie May. 
CHORUS. 
My little witching Maggie, 
Maggie, singing all the day; 
Oh how I 
love her, none can tell, 
My 
little Maggie May. 
Though years rolled on, yet still I 
loved, 
With heart so light and gay, 
And never will this heart deceive 
My own dear Maggie May. 
When others thought that life was gone. 
And death would take away, 
Still by my side did linger one— 
And that was Maggie May. 
My little witching Maggie, &c. 
May heaven protect me for her sake, 
I 
pray both night and day, 
That I, ere long, may call her mine, 
My own dear Maggie May. 
For she is all the world to me, 
Although I'm far away, 
oft-times think of the running brook, 
And my little Maggie May, 
My 
little witching Maggie, &",e,

Be Quiet, or 
Scream. 
SERIO-COMIC SONG. 
One bright Midsummer's eve 
With Harry by my side, 
As we went strolling forth. 
I 
fancied that be sighed; 
his arm around ray waist, 
With joy his eyes did beam, 
lie asked a 
kiss—says I, 
" 
Be quiet, or 
scream." 
We reached my cottage door, 
He bade me there good-bye, 
My heart rebuked me then, 
I 
thought of his deep sigh •, 
So smiling at my beau. 
Who rather glum did seem 
Says I, " love, take a 
kiss, 
- 
never meant to scream." 
We tread the same old path, 
Though years I've been a 
wife, 
Our days glide on in bliss, 
We know no care or strife; 
The walks are just the same, • 
The moon as bright doth beam, 
But if he failed to kiss, 
Oh dear! how I 
should scream.

The Village Spire. 
Words by Geo. K. Paxon. 
Music by Chas. W. Glover. 
Amid the old elms again do I 
see 
My own village spire so lovely to me; 
Tho time and the storm have passed o'er thy head, 
And youth's dearest friends now rest with the dead; 
Tho' lands I 
have seen, and sorrows have known, 
And life's happy morn to evening has grown, 
Tay sainted sweet spire again do I 
see, 
My own village spire so lovely to me, 
My own village spire so lovely to me. 
I 
left thee in youth, when in thy old aisle, 
I 
first breathed a 
prayer, unconscious of guile 
When in thy churchyard at even I've strayed, 
While music so sweet the merry bells made; 
I 
come to thee now when round thee do rest 
The parent, the friend, and all I 
love best; 
Thy chimes do I 
hear, again thee I 
see, 
My own village spire so lovely to me, 
My own village spire so lovely to me.
