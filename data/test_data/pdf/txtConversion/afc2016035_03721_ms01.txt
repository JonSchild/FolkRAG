Kim Spicer interviewed by Jaime Lopez and Seta re Arashloo 
Okay, so just a little note. This was an idea that was based out of the stories that we 
share on the job. You get to know journeymen and women. Share stories about each 
other and create these relationships, but when you leave the job or you separate these 
stories get lost. This is almost honoring those conversations as well. [00:00:30] If you 
would like to start by telling us your name and your job title. 
Kim Spicer, A journey wire woman. 
Okay. Can you tell us your background? Where you were born, where your parents are 
from. 
Okay, I was born in Brooklyn New York. My mom was born in Staten Island New York 
and my dad was born in South Carolina. I was going to say New York. 
[00:01:00] What neighborhood do you live in now? 
Right now I live at the Flushing Fresh Meadows, whatever it goes by. In the Electchester. 
What is some of your hobbies? 
I'm really into art. I like to draw, paint, cooking, knit crochet, anything with sports, just 
about. I think except football. [00:01:30] I'm not into football or anything like that. 
What is your division? What division are you working in and what types of work are you- 
I'm in the A-division. Right now I'm on a residential job. I've done data. I think I've done 
just about everything except for I think fiber. Yeah, right now I'm doing a residential high 
rise and it's challenging. 
Where is it? 
It's [00:02:00] inTribeca on Leonard Street, 42 Leonard Street. 
Seta re Arashloo : 
How do you explain A division? 
Kim Spicer: A-division is anyone I believe that's been through the apprenticeship, that did their five 
and a half years' time as an apprentice at MU and then went to journey person status. 
Jamie Lopez: Could you describe this job sight that you're on? 
Kim Spicer: Okay, a disaster. It's been [00:02:30] going on I think ... I'm hearing different stories 
between six and eight years. I told a few people and two of them were shop stewards 
and they were like oh God, I feel sorry for you. Then when I get there I'm like I can see 
why. It's so many hands that have touched things in the building that you don't know. 
Nothing's consistent and you know the building, it's a building so you know apartments 
so there's usually consistency like we do a hotel, but it's not that way. If I have to do a 
three way I [00:03:00] can't find where the feed is. I got to troubleshoot, figure out 
what's going where before I can do anything. I've put on plate covers and it blew up. It's 
just you don't know what's going on there. It's a real challenge. 
Setare Arashloo: Is it a renovation or is it being built? 
Kim Spicer: No, it's new construction. Yeah, that's what's terrifying about it, its new construction. 
Jamie Lopez: So you're at this point the hotel is up. Can you describe what the state of the hotel is 
and [crosstalk 00:03:25] 
Kim Spicer: It's up, no it's actually a million dollar high rise and [00:03:30] there are residents living 
in the building while the construction is going on and I can't comprehend how that's 
happening. It's filthy, it's dusty. You know if it's construction that dust that's on 
everything it's everywhere. There's people living there and they're getting on elevators 
with us and I'm like this is insane. 
Jamie Lopez: So you're amongthe tenants, you're working among the tenants. 
Kim Spicer: Yes, mm-hmm (affirmative). 
Jamie Lopez: How does that work? Or how doesn't it work? 
Kim Spicer: All right it doesn't work when [00:04:00] you need to get on an elevator and you really 
need to get on it, but you're not supposed to be on it, but you get on it anyway because 
you need to get to your job sight instead of sitting around waiting for the one freight 
elevator where you have that engineer picking and choosing where he wants to go and 
you're sitting downstairs for an hour and 40 minutes sometimes on a bucket just waiting 
to get on an elevator. And then the residents are there asking you questions. "How long 
is this going to take?" I'm like, "I don't know, I'm just here to do the electrical work and 
that's it." 
You're also trying to make sure that they don't get impaled or cut by any of the material 
[00:04:30] that you're carrying. Just in passing because a lot of times I usually have a big 
knife hanging off my belt and I figured that it's open sometimes because it's handy and 
it's like the sickle knife and I have to make sure it's closed because I've seen people get

cut by accident. If it's not one of us, we know what to look for and they don't get 
injured. 
: How many years have you been an electrician? 
This is going to be my 10th year. I came in 2007, but I got initiated [00:05:00] 2008. 
: Do you remember your first day? 
Yes, yes I do. They had me on; I think it was a six foot ladder with the huge chopping 
gun, with the huge bit chopping through a wall. 
Your first day. 
Yes. 
That's interesting. 
Yes. 
How did you feel about that? What was going through your mind? 
I'm like okay, I'm going to get this done and I blew right through [00:05:30] that wall and 
that was it. He was like, "Wow, that's a big hole." I'm like, "You told me to do this and 
that's what I did." Yea h, that job was yeah, that was a fun job. 
Can we backtrack a little bit? Can you tell me about any jobs that you had before you 
became an electrician? 
Oh wow, I had so many jobs before I became an electrician because I didn't like anything 
that I did, except for when I was in human resources [00:06:00] at Baruch College. I was 
a dental assistant before I came in because I was in school for electric mechanical 
engineering so I did that for about three years and I was trying to pay for school so then 
I found out that you could go to NYU to be a dental assistant, you know and make 
money. I'm like okay I'll pay for college that way. I did it and as soon as I got into clinical 
rotation I knew it wasn't for me because I could not deal with working with people 
[00:06:30] and listen to them complain about something that if they had taken care of 
their teeth they wouldn't have these issues. 
It just drove me insane. The only thingthat I liked doing was fabricating things and 
working with my hands and staying in the lab away from everybody else. I did not want 
to do a patient whatsoever. 
That's hard to believe because I know you used to be a very personable young lady. 
Yeah, but when you're a patient and it's just like ... Then it's like so many horrifying 
things that I've seen [00:07:00] and it's just like oh my gosh I can't, I can't do this. I can't 
Kim Spicer (2) 
Page 3 of25 
Seta re Arashloo 
Kim Spicer: 
Jamie Lopez: 
Kim Spicer: 
Jamie Lopez: 
Kim Spicer: 
listen. It's crazy because I say I can't listen, but when I'm on a construction site I deal 
with people that whine, but it's like you can tell them, "Shut the hell up." I don't want to 
hear this, or you just walk away. You can say whatever you want, but with a patient you 
can't show the horror in your face when you see certain things. You'll have the mask on, 
but your eyes can give you away sometimes too. That was a challenge, [00:07:30] yeah 
it was. I almost didn't graduate, but I was like you know what I'm here, I'm committed 
I'm going to get through and then I'm out of here. 
: How did you start the apprentice program? 
I forgot what I was doing. I would see these signs about N.E.W nontraditional 
employment for women everywhere and I was still in tech for the engineering and I saw 
it on a bus stop and I was like I'm going to call it one day because [00:08:00] even 
though we were in school for engineering everyone knew that you probably wouldn't 
get a job doing electric mechanical engineering, then they were changing it to computer 
engineering and it was kind of changing the curriculum because I really wanted to do 
robotics. I was like I'm probably not going to get a job. Let me try this, see if I can get 
something else that fits into it, when I saw you could do construction I'm like okay 
electrician I can do that because I've had wiring blueprints and everything in college. 
When I called upthey were like, "Yeah, come in." Came in, took the test, [00:08:30] I got 
into a class and they tried to make me become a carpenter because I was really good 
and I'm like, "I didn't come here for that, I don't want to be a carpenter. That's easy, I 
want to do something challenging. What I went to school for, in that same realm." They 
were like, "Oh what are you going to do in the meantime? Local three they're not 
recruiting for another eight months." I was like I guess I will wait. I'll wait. So I went and 
got a job at... I forgot about that job, at Roosevelt Investment Group and I was there as 
a temp and they wanted to hire me. I'm like yeah, [00:09:00] I'll take the job. I'm going 
to take this as long as it takes until Local Three calls in. With N.E.W they speed up the 
process. 
I think I took the test in June and I was having my physical in August and I was in school 
by September. It was really fast. I got in at a good time. That was also the time when the 
bubble and people were you know that whole wait and everything and work reduction 
and the whole Enron thing. What is it?The housing market. [00:09:30] Something 
happened, and yeah when I came in I was like oh wow this is different. It was like yeah 
we're going to be out of work 12 months. I'm like what? I was an apprentice so I was just 
like okay. I'm just listening taking in everything, but I'm glad I stayed with it. 
How many years did you say you're in the business now? 
This would have been my 10th year. 
This is [00:10:00] your 10th year. Did you have any family members in the business? 
My sister is a carpenter. Oh you mean Local three? No, no. 
Kim Spicer (2) 
Page 4 of 25 
Jamie Lopez: Your sister's a carpenter? 
Kim Spicer: Yes. 
Jamie Lopez: How do you feel about that, your sister being a carpenter? 
Kim Spicer: I told her no. 
Jamie Lopez: Why? 
Kim Spicer: Because, I told her I said all you're going to be doing is sheet rocking. You're not going to 
be like Norm Abrams tongue and groove and making all nice fancy nice wood things. 
That's not going to happen. You're goingto [00:10:30] either be fire stopping, humping 
Sheetrock, and that's it. It's going to be boring. She's dyslexic, so she assumed oh you're 
an electrician, I'm like no, you're not going to do the math that you think we're going to 
do. I was like it's different, you're going to do more math as a carpenter. There's 
fractions and everything. Now she's like oh yeah, you're right. I'm like yeah I told you 
when Local three comes knocking you better take that test. 
Jamie Lopez: Is she your younger sister? 
Kim Spicer: Yes. 
Jamie Lopez: Oh so that's why you have that schooling her a little bit. 
Kim Spicer: Yeah, I have to. 
Setare Arashloo: Can you [00:11:00] explain the learning process of becoming an electrician 
How did you learn? 
Kim Spicer: Well you know what, I was always handy. Someone posted on Facebook their first tool 
was they showed a butter knife to take things out and I'm like, "No, we had tools at my 
house like screwdrivers, pliers, and everything." I did all this stuff before I got in. I was 
always comfortable with tools and using tools even when I got into college I was 
bending my boxes forming the metal and everything on [00:11:30] my own. I was always 
comfortable. When you get in there they just throw you right... They put me on a 
ladder with a chopping gun. It's like this is something I never used before. It's like a little 
mini jack hammer and it's banging against the wall and if didn't prop myself up right I 
could have pushed myself off the ladder, but I knew how to hold the gun and I just 
jumped right in. 
Speaker 3: Did you go to school at the same time? 
Kim Spicer: Yes, the same day. They started me on a Monday. I had school Monday and Wednesday. 
[00:12:00] So that Monday I went to work and then I went to school. That was hard. 
You're so beaten up and you have to go to school and they're like stay awake. And I'm

Kim Spicer: 
Seta re Arashloo 
Kim Spicer: 
Jamie Lopez: 
Kim Spicer: 
Jamie Lopez: 
Kim Spicer: 
like what? Stay awake? Okay. Then you fade, then you snap out of it, then you fade, 
yeah, it's hard. 
Did your other jobs transition into this job? Did things carry over from your other jobs? 
I'm sure, yes. Yeah. [00:12:30] I'm thinking when I went to Baruch, for human resources 
and you had to deal with people and their payroll and just knowing stuff about payroll 
and money and when I get to a job site and they're telling me things about payroll and 
I'm like unacceptable. They're like oh this shop has a lot of people. I'm like "Well Baruch 
college I'm sure has a lot more people than that and I did the direct deposit for the 
students and the faculty so you can't tell me that you can't punch in a few numbers and 
have my direct deposit." I would just go off. They're like [00:13:00] oh okay. I'm like 
yeah. Little things here and there helped me out a lot. 
: Can you explain a typical day at your job? 
Okay, a typical day is waiting forever for the elevator, which works perfectly fine, you 
don't need an engineer to press the button for you. We're just mostly going around like 
this building should have been done by now, so it's almost like punch list things. Like 
[00:13:30] there's things that are missing that should have been there. Like we were 
troubleshooting this wire for a day, couldn't find it, so of course the foreman he finally 
comes around he was like, "Try that box right there." I climb up a 12 foot ladder, open it 
up and I'm like, why didn't he come here yesterday and say try this box while we're 
going upstairs opening up panels, trying to tug on these wires and everything, no one 
hasa toner. Itwasjust madness. It'sa lot of troubleshooting trying to figure out where 
things are. If they're buried [00:14:00] in a deck do we have to chop to get to a box 
that's in the floor, but no one knows because this isn't the foreman that was there when 
it started. It's just chaos. 
When you say troubleshooting, I know you mentioned a three way switch earlier. In 
residential we use multiple switches to control the single lights. Can you explain a little 
bit about what a three way switch is, how it works and what you're troubleshooting? 
Oh, okay. Well three way switch is when you have two switches in two different 
[00:14:30] locations and they control the same light. If you hit one on or off, if it's on 
and you go to the other switch you can turn it off and vice versa the other side. I forgot, 
what was the question again? 
How does it work and how do you troubleshoot this thing? 
Okay well when they're supposed to turn on and off so I brought in my two little light 
bulb holders and you plugthem in, so I brought in two so I could make sure [00:15:00] 
that they worked properly. We had one on one circuit at the top and the other was a 
different circuit. So I put them in the top so I could make sure that they work. They 
weren't working. What I had to do was, I put a device on it to see where the current is 
going through to make sure that it turns on. The current was there, but it just wasn't 
turning on. Then I would try the other one to see what was going on and the other

Kim Spicer: 
receptacle wasn't working and then the light wasn't working. [00:15:30] I found out that 
the power was going to a receptacle somewhere else that had nothing to do with this 
and then it jumped out. The power was going back to another receptacle I'm saying this 
words- 
It's Good, It's Good [inaudible 00:15:48]. 
The electricity was going to the wrong spot and it was supposed to go in between these 
two lights and they weren't, so I had to turn the power off and isolate [00:16:00] where 
the electricity was going and figure out which way to send it so that involved tracing it 
was finding the travelers, which are the two wires that go in between the two lights to 
make sure the power goes back and forth and that wasn't happening. I would have to 
put my ... I have a tester. I would ground it and then go to the other side to try to get 
some continuity. Okay that's right, find the other one, that's right. Then [00:16:30] I 
would find the hot. Then I would turn the power off and it's still hot and I'm like okay 
this isn't it, something's wrong. Back and forth I had to just keep going back and forth 
until I had 16 wires here and there and everything had little pieces of tape because 
there's no tags there. Nothings labeled, there was so many hands in everything that it's 
chaos. 
Once I got everything together, spliced everything out right, everything worked 
properly. I think that was one I was able to walk away from the rest, [00:17:00] yeah, all 
day. 
Through that frustration that you're going through isolating and deciding which wire and 
identifying, how do you feel when you walk away and it works? 
I feel very accomplished, but annoyed at the same time because it should have been 
done the right way. The feed should have been brought to where it was supposed to be. 
Here I am I'm drilling a three way like okay I see this, I know what it is, but I have to look 
at this so I can make sure I'm doing [00:17:30] everything right. I'm glad that I did that, 
because if I didn't I would just be confused by looking at all these wires that are the 
same color, some aren't and it's just madness in your head. You know, you know this, 
but you're getting frustrated. This was my second day on the job and I'm like oh my gosh 
what did I get thrown into. 
It's like I have an appreciation for pipe more than circuitry. It's just like if I do it myself 
I'm fine, but if someone else, no. 
This is [00:18:00] perfect that you said that, because there's a variety of works i n our 
industry and I know for a fact because I have you as a Facebook friend, I usually see you 
in photos and you're hanging off a ladder and you have pipe or wire in your hands with a 
big smile. Can you explain a little bit about how this happens and where these pictures 
come from and why? 
You know because I see that it's a terrible situation. There's one where I'm in mud 
[00:18:30] and it's this PVC and I had to climb down into a hole and hopefully not cause

all the dirt to come down upon me, like an avalanche situation because I slid down and 
I'm in these booths that I have to probably cut off later because they were forced on 
and I'm standing there and I'm wet and I'm on a dead job and it's cold and I'm like oh my 
gosh and I'm like, "Frank, take a picture of me, I need this." I'm trying to get this guy to 
take a picture. Everything, I just try to smile through it. It's kind of like when we did the 
Spartan race [00:19:00] and I was trying to get other people to join. I told them when 
they come up the steps I'm like, "Smile, smile for the picture." And they're like this. It's 
like, "Smile." They're like, then they'll roll their eyes at me, I was like, "I don't care, go 
get up there, smile. Smile everybody, smile." You know, so it doesn't look that bad. 
Okay. You mentioned the Spartan race and I asked you earlier about the wellness club, 
that you're involved with. Can you explain a little about that club? 
The wellness club was formed [00:19:30] by Michele Maldonado it's to get people 
healthy. When you're on the job site, I'm not a fan of eggs or cheese so I never ate 
bacon egg and cheese, but that's a common sandwich. I've had sandwiches that are like 
bacon egg and cheese with sausage and put jelly on it or a cream cheese bagel with 
bacon. I'm like oh you want the heart attack, okay I'm going to write down heart attack. 
Or you know cream cheese with sausage. Just these insane sandwiches and these guys 
are putting them away every day. With [00:20:00] a big soda or a big juice and it's out of 
control. A lot of people they have a lot of issues. I have worked with a lot of great guys 
that have passed away from heart attacks. A lot of them, heart attacks, young, in their 
40's. Just dropping from heart attacks because they're eating this bad food and not 
taking care of themselves. 
So she started the club and she saw me on Facebook doing all these crazy races and I 
used to do a lot of running, then I found out about the obstacle course when I got my 
sneakers [00:20:30] fitted for me because they're like you're wearing the wrong 
sneakers so I got the right sneakers. Then I saw a race and I'm like oh I would like to do 
that, I want to climb and do things. That's how I got in. She saw me do all these different 
things. She was like I want you to become the activities coordinator to get people to do 
races and that's how I got into the wellness club. 
She's a fellow electrician? 
Yes she is. 
She's a journeyman? 
Yes she's a journey woman. 
How did you meet her? 
I don't know. I think maybe through Amber [00:21:00] Light. Just in passing we kept 
running into each other, different things. Then we became Facebook friends so then she 
started seeing things. Then I went out to Santorini with I believe Amber Light, or it might 
have been the Asian club, because I was a part of the Asian club first because I lived

downtown. I moved downtown Manhattan. I was close to China Town and their club 
meetings were across the street. Who was it Mary R, she was like "Come down club, you 
can come down, we're walking." I'm like, "But it's the Asian club." She was like, "Yeah, 
come [00:21:30] on down." I'm like, "Okay." They welcomed me and I ended up doing 
the dragon boat race with them. It was insane. Two years ago we won the silver medal, 
you couldn't tell us anything. When electricians win, we win big. Even if it's a silver 
medal, oh my gosh we were, yes. 
You were excited. 
Oh we were over the top. We could have done a cartwheel on the boat it would have 
been, but we were trying to stay afloat. 
For the people that are listening maybe in the future may not understand what kind of 
clubs these [00:22:00] are. These are workers, electricians, fellow electricians. 
Yes. 
All different types of cultures and ways and walks of life. 
Yes, mm-hmm (affirmative). 
So yeah I'm ha ppy that they welcomed you. 
Yes. 
Even though I'm like Latino descent, I've been welcomed into the Latimer's Club, which 
is the African American ... So I know how you feel. It's a good feeling to be accepted. 
Yeah. 
Yeah very good. 
: [00:22:30] Can you tell us a little about your co-worker and the relationships on 
the job sites, in any job sites it doesn't have to be the current one, but- 
Well, my current co-worker's awesome, Ines. I've been lucky in this industry so far 
where I've been with a lot of women. As a first year I was with Dell Electric and I ended 
up on a deck job, which was another nightmare, but I learned a lot. I met a good friend, 
who I'm still friends with now. [00:23:00] We don't talk often, but when we talk it's like 
we picked up where we left off. There were two female electricians, it was Luz and 
Stella. Anybody know Stella? I was with those two. We had two female fitters, two 
female carpenters, plumbers, surveyors. Every trade had at least two or three females, 
so I'm like I'm on a job with a bunch of women. We had bathrooms everywhere. The 
bathrooms situations a whole other thing.

My current co-worker, Ines she's awesome. She's there, I'm like, "Ines, I'm about to lose 
it. Somethings going on." She's [00:23:30] there, we talk through it, we work great 
together. We talk about everything, who's whiny, who's not. We got the new RERW's on 
the job. They work like they're still nonunion so we're just like "You need to calm down 
before someone gets hurt and just relax." They're like, "No, I need everything." I'm like, 
"Okay you keep working that way, you'll catch on soon enough." They're only 18 months 
in since we started that RERW thing. 
RERW is Residential Wire man or helpers I think [00:24:00] right? 
Yes. 
They recently been organized into our industry similar to M [crosstalk 00:24:09] journey 
men, and M Women and M helpers. To clarification. 
Oh yeah I forgot. 
I think you're doing great. Don't be afraid to use the language that we use. We can 
always explain it later. It will work. It will work out. 
: Have you ever felt unsafe at a job site? 
[00:24:30] Yes. Yes, because it's electrical so it's either you feel unsafe depending on 
who you're working with, because you could have a dangerous partner. There are a lot 
of reckless people out there. There are a lot of old timers who do reckless things, there's 
a lot of young people that do reckless things, there's a lot of people that aren't healthy 
that do reckless things. 
: Like what sort of- 
Just like, I had a friend once tell me how we're electricians we don't climb down off 
[00:25:00] of ladders, we jump. And he jumped on a screw, and that screw had to be 
unscrewed out of his foot with a piece of wood because he jumped off of a ladder. I 
don't know anyone that's an electrician that jumps off of a ladder unless their life is in 
danger. He jumped off of a ladder onto a screw. That's reckless behavior. Not testing 
things. There's a certain way you carry tubing or conduit pipe. You're supposed to carry 
when you're walking up so this way you don't poke somebody in the eye or hit 
[00:25:30] them a certain way you got to watch where you're swinging. You got to know 
your swing radius and everything and make sure you don't hurt anyone with your tools. 
The people, they just don't have any consideration for others and that's with other 
trades too. You got to watch out for everybody. 
When you walk in, you got to look, see what's going on up above you. Certain noises 
that you hear you know something's coming or something may be coming. There's 
danger ahead. There's certain things that you hear. You know what to look for.

Did you always have that sensitivity to [00:26:00] danger, or was it something that you 
developed? 
I don't know I probably had a sensitivity because I grew up in Brownsville and there was 
always danger. From I guess when I was a teenager when the neighborhood really 
started to get bad. It was always danger. You knew what to look for. When they say you 
see one person running, you run. Yeah, that type of thing. 
A colleague of mine always recognized electricians or construction workers as being 
really quick with their reflexes. [00:26:30] Do you feel that you've developed that or 
you've always had reflexes? 
I've always had reflexes, but yeah even more so I've noticed that its been heightened. I 
catch a lot of things. I don't know my dad thinks he's an electrician, but he does 
everything. He'll be like yeah you know the thing on the wall. I'm like, "The box, the 
panel?" He's like, "Yeah, yeah, you know you stick the wires in." I'm like, "Yeah okay 
dad. You just keep doing what you're doing I'll do what I do. You [00:27:00] can't show 
me anything, I'm not messing with you." He thinks he knows everything. I don't know, it 
might be something that I got from my dad because I'm handy and comfortable with 
certain things, except for confined spaces and insects. That's not my, yeah. 
Yes, I do recall something like that. You didn't like the bugs somewhere. 
Yeah, I was in the projects and I was working in the projects. My skin right now there's 
all these things on there, I got really sensitive skin, and I was exposed to some stuff that 
gave me headaches [00:27:30] the entire time I was there and I didn't realize it was from 
the job and when I left the headaches stop. I let the foreman have it and I called up, I 
forgot his name, McCormick and I let him know. He was like, "Yeah, fill out a report, this 
way you don't have to go back." It was serious. That place was terrible. I tell my 
foreman, "Do you see my face. It wasn't like this when we were at the trade center and 
now it's like this and I have headaches." I ended up getting off that job and then a week 
or two after the plumbers [00:28:00] coming in like, "Oh yeah we can't work here." Now 
they're doing all this. I'm like, "Are you kidding me?" 
It's frustrating. 
Yeah, I was just like, "Are you kidding me?" Then the foreman he ends up coming on the 
joband I'm like, "Yeah so aboutthat job again, I'm so sorry." I was like, "You're saying 
you're sorry, but every day ..." I told him every day, every meeting I'm like, "You better 
get some fresh air in here you got us in this confined space." Me and my partner would 
blitz and blow and get it done and he was like, "Oh yeah we're goingto bring in some 
air." 
So he brings in that, [00:28:30] I forgot what the little box is that brings the air in and 
the tube. The intake box, I forgot what that thing was called, he brings it into the 
compactor room, we're in the projects in a basement. The compactor room has things 
crawling in there, I'm already starting to itch, roaches, spiders, and flies, so you're giving 
Kim Spicer (2) 
Page 11 of 25 
Speaker 1: 
Kim Spicer: 
Jamie Lopez: 
Kim Spicer: 
me air that has these things ... I took that tube and I threw it out. Also me I'm like I told 
Robinson I was like, "Robinson, we're going to get this [00:29:00] done." I even have a 
video of us at one point, where there's spiders in the corner and I'm freaking out and I'm 
telling him to go in there. The only two people that were confined space certified were 
the two people that were most afraid. 
There was one point where we saw a roach and we ran into each other. If we would 
have ran any faster we would have bounced off each other and hit the floor. The 
apprentice was just sitting there laughing at us. I was like I can't believe I got these two 
mechanics here running away from anything that moved. It was real, we were both 
serious. We were jumping all the time. It [00:29:30] was madness. 
Not to tear into it or bring it up again, but you said blitz and blow, it's one of those 
terminologies that we use. Sometimes frowned upon, but can you explain what it is? 
It's when you get in there if it's a job and you want to get it done you get it done fast 
and then you can leave. We were going to go in there, we're going to get the job done 
and then we're out of there. Because that was the deal that we made because it was 
[00:30:00] such horrible conditions. Like I said, with the air and everything between the 
bugs. It was hot, it was the summer time. I already had on a Tyvek suit and I'm not a big 
sweater. I can run, I won't have any sweat stains or anything on me, just from my head 
or something. Everything was wet on me. Everything, I mea n everything. 
I'm like okay this is not for me. I can't be sweating like this, I'm going to die. I drink a lot 
of water. That's still not enough. I'm like if I'm drinking a lot of water as it is and I need 
to drink more there's a problem. [00:30:30] We would get the job done really fast and 
then we were done and that was our deal. If we get this certain amount of feet of pipe 
done then we were out of there. We were taking the apprentice with us. We were like, 
"He gets to leave too." Because the apprentice, first of all he's not supposed to be in 
there. He was passing us all the tools. We were like, "He's with us, he gets a part of this 
too." That was the deal, us and the apprentice so we would get it done and then we 
would get out of there. Whatever we had, whatever it took to get it done we got it 
done. 
Can you explain a little bit about [00:31:00] you like pipework and conduit ducting and 
putting wire I suppose? Can you explain how that came about and your experience with 
that type of work? 
I don't know, for some reason ever since I was a first year apprentice they like putting 
me on the bull gang, which is the people that pull the wire or set up these big wire pulls 
like 600s, like big. I think I got a picture of it. Big wires and for some reason, that's why 
[00:31:30] there's a picture of me on a ladder, they had me pulling this wire. I think I 
was pulling through a feed, I'm not sure, but it's like I'm the girl, why am I doingthis? 
But I got it done, so I guess they saw that I had some sort of strength and they kept 
putting me on it. I'm like okay these people, why? Why do I have to do this? I would end 
up on four inch pipe, and we would get it done. Eventually we get done.

For some reason, I don't know my partners like me, I guess we work well together so it 
was always good. I [00:32:00] rarely had any partners that I... Just one that I could think 
though, now I'm starting to think. There were a few that I was like I can't, I can't do this 
anymore. 
Kim, could you characterize a typical, not to stereotype, but a typical bull gang worker? 
Oh man, it's always usually an old timer, yeah usually an old timer bigguy. It's always 
the big guys, [00:32:30] that's why I'm like not a big guy. It's a big guy with big beefy 
hands and he just wants to take stuff and throw it around and tape everything up. He 
got to be the man and everything is like yeah, and I'm sittingthere I'm like it's not that 
serious. That's how people get hurt. It's always those hyped up guys. Usually, usually 
you get the gentleman. Those are the guys I like to work with, where they're clean and 
they stay clean. Then we're going to do it like this and we're going to take our time. 
[00:33:00] That's it. 
They broke the mold with you? 
Yeah, I'm not that guy. 
: Has your job ever felt creative to you? 
Yes. Yes. Yes, especially when I was in the Oculus and we had a ceiling that was a 
geometrical thing, like these carpenters were fantastic, but we had to get into that 
ceiling. [00:33:30] It kind of looked like where Superman was in the crystal and the 
crystal started shooting up and everything, that's how it was. I'm like, okay, now I got to 
bend pipe and make this work. I'm bending the pipe and I'm doing racks, but nothing is 
square. You're trying to measure, but it's hard to measure, but then it's like you got to 
go by sight because I was an apprentice I learned everything has to be straight, even, 
level, beautiful. Here it's not coming out that way. I'm taking more time, my foreman's 
like, [00:34:00] "No." And I'm like, "It has to look right." Because if it's not right when 
you pull the wire it's going to be a problem if it's not right and you have too many 
bends. He's like, "Oh just..." I'm like, "No, because I'm going to have to pull this wire, 
somebody and they're going to be cussing me out." 
Yeah, there was some funky bends that I had to make. Kind of almost like a question 
mark because I had to come out of a box and down to a light. I saw it today at work and 
I'm like I remember I had to do that once. And to see it again I was like okay. Then 
[00:34:30] shaping in a panel, or the data racks. That can be yeah. 
Oh tell me about the data racks. 
Yeah the data racks forthe computers and telephone and you have a lot of blue cable 
and you want it to look nice and streamline. Just nice and neat and in order. You can 
follow it sometimes, depending on who does it. It can be beautiful and it can be a 
disaster. 
Kim Spicer (2) 
Page 13 of 25 
Jamie Lopez: So have you worked personally [00:35:00] on terminating those data racks? 
Kim Spicer: Yeah, a couple of times, but not too much. Not where I can actually I punched down a 
whole rack and made it look nice. When I was at the Oculus I did the data there because 
the foreman was completely lost. He didn't know what was going on. He was like, "Oh 
yeah I got this tool." I'm like, "So where are the jacks?" He gives me the ...I think the RJ, 
the one that looks like a telephone that goes into a phone and not that looks like an 
Ethernet. It's supposed you know it was- 
Jamie Lopez: He gave [00:35:30] you the male part instead of the- 
Kim Spicer: Yes, and he was like, "Here." And I'm like, "No." So I had to go on Google, show it to him 
and the project manager what I needed and the tool that I needed in order to get the 
job done. I was just like okay. When it came to the end and nothing was working I was 
like, "But the racks are working, right?" He was like, "Yeah." I was like, "Okay." 
What I did all by myself is done. I landed everything, the cameras all work and 
everything's working and my racks [00:36:00] are good okay. 
Jamie Lopez: And they look good. 
Kim Spicer: Yes, yes it did. Yes. I should have taken a picture of that now that I'm thinking about it. 
Setare Arashloo: Have you ever passed a tool to someone or have a tool passed onto you as a 
gift? 
Kim Spicer: Yes, I've had tools given to me, yes. A few. A few cool tools and I've passed along some 
tools [00:36:30] to apprentices that you could see potential in them. Not some that 
were knucklehead that you didn't know what was goin to happen at some point. I had a 
good apprentice, Kevin, the one that was laughing at us with the roaches and 
everything. I would tell, "Order this, when you go to Home Depot with the card." I would 
give him tools and then I also bought him the app for iBend just in case. I'm like, "When 
you can't figure something out, you can refer to this everybody uses it. Don't feel bad, 
don't let them guilt you into it because if you want to get something done and 
something needs to get [00:37:00] done this will help you. It's a tool, use it." It was free 
when I got it, but not with Apple I guess it become popular they started charging for it, 
so I'm like, "Here, use this app." 
Jamie Lopez: Can you explain that transition or that gesture? How it feels or how it felt when you 
received something. What does it mea n to hand tools or transfer tools in that manner? 
Kim Spicer: I don't know, it's kind of like a passing the baton type of thing like in a race. They always 
say that you need to teach your apprentice because [00:37:30] they need to come up 
behind you to keep the flow going for your benefits and everything, you need to keep 
the business strong and everyone knowledgeable. A lot of people try to hide their 
knowledge. People would pass things along to me and then I would pass it along to any 
apprentices that I had. At least try. Some that I saw I would try to give it to them and I

saw what they was using, I'm like okay I'm wasting my time, but I'm going to keep trying 
with this one to see what happens. All you can do is try. 
Yeah, it was just like what is it the [00:38:00] no dog. I would get it engraved for them. 
"Here use this; you're going to need one of these." 
What is a no dog? 
It's a level, kind of like a level so when you're a bending a pipe one way and you want it 
to be level the other way so that it's not dogged, or twisted you want it straight, you put 
the no dog on it the first time so this way you have it the way you need it straight and 
then when you flip it over and you level it, you know which way it is so that it stays 
straight. You get your pipe bent the right way. So yeah I got a lot of no dogs and little 
[00:38:30] six inch levels for apprentices. 
Those are your favorite tools? 
Yeah, I have a couple of levels in my bag and channels. 
Keep in line with the essence of tradition, do you happen to have a favorite Local Three 
tradition or can you think of some other Local Three traditions that you admire or 
respect? 
Traditions. I don't know there's so many. [00:39:00] Oh my gosh. 
You know just to throw one in there. I like the idea of journeymen when they retire 
getting limousines home like the workers gathering together and sending the 
journeyman or woman off in a limousine. I think that's a classy touch. 
I like that too. 
Can you think of any others? 
I like when there's someone that they've mentored or someone that someone brought 
in when they hand them [00:39:30] their card. When they get initiated or when they get 
their A card, whatever it is. Whatever promotion it is, whoever got them in or brought 
them or if it's a family member. I like seeing that. Like Candy, when his sister came in he 
was giving his sister her card and everything. I really like that. 
Yeah, so what about that though, what is it about it that makes you feel good? 
I don't know, it just seems like I'm bringing you into another family. Because it's a family 
situation as far as I'm concerned, other people [00:40:00] you know. I see it as that. It's 
like okay you're going to become one of us. You know he's just welcome her into the 
gates of local three you know. 
Welcome to the gates, that's beautiful.

Bathrooms. 
You know this is the second time that you mentioned the bathrooms. Can you tell us 
about the bathrooms? 
Okay, well the bathrooms are gross. For the most part, [00:40:30] if you have one we 
have to have a lock on it to keep the guys out because for some reason they use the 
bathroom everywhere. Not all, but some because like I said you have the gentlemen and 
then you have the ones that just... And I mean everything everywhere. We have to keep 
our bathrooms locked. If we got to pour the sandwich, I loathe. You got to keep it 
locked. We always keep our nice and I remember when we were in the college class and 
the guys were like, "How come the girls always have the nice bathroom." I'm like, 
[00:41:00] okay I got to refrain from language, we try not to put everything everywhere 
like you guys do. So that's why our bathroom stays so clean, because we keep it clean. 
You got to talk to your fellow construction workers and try to keep it tidy. It's terrible. 
It's either that or no running water. I need this. I need to wash my hands with soap not 
sanitizer. 
What's your current situation at the hotel? 
[00:41:30] No, it's an apartment building so there's bathrooms and beingthat it's a 
multi-million dollar there's bathrooms in every bedroom, so that's good and there's a 
bathroom downstairs on the first floor that we can use or one of the various 
apartments. The doors already have locks on them so that's good. We're able to ... And 
then there's hot water so you get all the dirt off. You know, at least most of it off until 
you get home and take a real shower. I like that situation. 
: Interesting. 
We also had a heated bathroom once, that was [00:42:00] nice. A heated porta stand. 
They hated us because we had a heated porta stand, but the foreman said you guys 
mess everything up so we had a heater porta stand it was awesome. I didn't know they 
made those. I did not know. I'm like oh my gosh, yes and it flushed and it had water. I'm 
like oh my gosh. 
Not to get too specific, but what is it like to use a porta stand in the middle of the 
winter? 
Oh it's so much fun. I wear a full arctic Carhartt suit, that's [00:42:30] kind of like a 
mechanics suit, but it's really layered for the winter. I'm anemic, so I'm always cold. I 
would have to take the suit down while I'm facing the porta stand, twist, keep the suit 
where it's at and twist it in front of me and tuck the sleeves in because you don't want it 
to touch anything and use the bathroom. That's it, yeah. 
I think it's a tough deal.

Yeah, it is. 
I think somehow when I used to have to do it, because I'm not at [00:43:00] the 
moment, we made it work though right. 
Well, yeah because you're a guy. We have to hover. No one's sitting on any seats so you 
got to hope that something's clean. That's the thing because you don't want to touch 
anything in there, but if it's the ladies you have no problem putting an elbow on a pipe 
and holding yourself up so you don't slip or anything like that because it's gross. 
What does it mean to be a union electrician or union member? 
[00:43:30] What does it mean? It means that a lot of people are going to ask you how 
can I get in. Anytime they see you with the Local Three symbol or anything, well the IBW 
symbol, I don't know what does it mean? It's prideful because it shows that if you're A, 
that you went through everything. You went through that five and a half year hazing. Of 
getting coffee, [00:44:00] and deliveries and all the craziness. You just feel really 
accomplished. It's like a brotherhood, sisterhood where you go out of state and you see 
someone. I was in Pennsylvania and I saw someone. I introduced myself and I told him 
I'm in Local Three and they're like, "Oh New York City." I'm like, "Yeah." I'm asking them 
what are they doing. I was in New Jersey, not New Jersey, Amtrak. An Amtrak train 
station and they were doing work. You just start noticing [00:44:30] things, like you're in 
Whole Foods and you're like, "Wow, they did the fire alarm really well." You see 
everything. You notice the littlest things now. 
When I'm at home and I got the level on my painting and I'm like yeah okay just stop 
touching the painting, I'm tired of leveling it. My OCD kicks in. 
: I have a video from Jamie that his OCD kicks in. 
Yeah, okay, yeah. 
My OCD kicks in all the time. 
Yes, is your car- 
[00:45:00] My car is all spotless. 
Yeah, I take the flat, you know the five inch box, and I scrape everything out, wipe it 
down and I have everything all nice. They're like, "What?" I'm like, "Look, don't mess 
with my car. Take what you want just do not set your coffee there because I don't want 
to smell it because I don't drink coffee. I don't want to smell your coffee, your tea. Leave 
myself alone." 
We were planning to give you a card [00:45:30] for coffee, you don't drink any coffee? 
No.

All right we're going to have to think of something. 
My sister works for Starbucks, she doesn't drink coffee either. The carpenter, when 
she's out of work, she goes to Starbucks. She doesn't drink coffee either. Yeah, none of 
my sisters do. 
I see that when you go out there that your job touches your life, but when does your job 
ever merge with [00:46:00] your home life or your personal life? 
Hmm. 
Or does it, or does not? 
No, the only time is if I want to do overtime and I can't because I got to make sure that 
my daughter is where she needs to be. That's kind of tough. I can't see it interfering. 
Well it did, when I had a dog. I was at the trade center and I was living downtown so at 
lunch time I would leave and walk my dog. They're like, "Why do you do that?" I'm like, 
"How many times a day do you use the bathroom? I'm not going to let her hold it. I'm 
going to let [00:46:30] her go, eat my apple along the way and then walk back. It's not a 
big deal; I'm a walker so I have no problem with that." 
What about relationship wise? People that you know. Does it ever go over to your home 
life and personal life? 
Sometimes because people think I can come over and do things for them. And it's like, 
no I'm not your handyman. [00:47:00] because no one would take ... Oh I'm sorry. 
No, it's good let me get you one. 
Like I said, I was always handy so when I was younger I would tell them things to do, 
whatever I would try to help them like I can do it and they're like, "Oh no." I'm going to 
feed this one story, they were like, "Oh no let Keith do it." I'm like, "Okay." So the guy 
comes over, he puts in a deadbolt lock that turns, and he put it in the wrong way. He's 
trying to shut the door and it's not shutting. Before [00:47:30] I could stop him, because 
I saw what he was doing, he took his foot and he kicked the door and I was like, "No, 
you idiot, what are you doing? We're stuck in here now!" "What do you mean?" I'm like, 
"These are the projects, this is a steel door, you just shoved another piece of metal in 
between it, we can't get out." We couldn't get out. 
So think of this, my friend was on the second floor. Call somebody up, they had to kick 
the door in. Before that I convinced him to wrap a sheet around himself to lower himself 
down to the first floor and I almost, [00:48:00] he had his head out the window and one 
leg and these guys came by and they were like, "What are you doing?" I was like, 
"Damn." I wanted him to go out that window so bad for getting us stuck in there, I was 
so mad. I always wanted to tie bedsheets together and go out of a window, but not 
personally because I know you'll die, but I was going to send this fool out there because 
he got us stuck in that apartment.

I looked, and I was like see this is what happens when you let someone, you didn't want 
to trust me. Now, they want to call on me. Oh what do I do? My friend almost burned 
her apartment down because she put a regular [00:48:30] I guess male part of an 
extension cord onto her washing machine. Oh no her dryer. 
She did it herself. 
Yeah. She was like, "I almost burned my apartment down." I'm like, "Yeah, first of all 
you're supposed to have an electrician do that and you had the wrong cord, it was the 
wrong one." She was like, "What am I supposed to do?" I was like, "Ask an electrician 
because I'm not going to have you do it yourself and then you kill yourself and your 
son." So yeah, yeah little things like that. Tell mom to stop, I'm putting in a ceilingan, 
don't [00:49:00] touch anything mom. Okay, let me turn off the breakers and mom is 
tinkering. I'm like, "Mom, I told you not to touch anything." She's handy too, but she 
figured I'm just gonna ... "No mom, please just let me do it please." 
: Can you tell us a little about Electchester? How do you like livingthere, when 
did you move there? Tell us a little about [crosstalk 00:49:21]. 
I actually like Electchester. I guess I got lucky to live in fourth housing. I'm in the back by 
the tower source, really quiet. [00:49:30] The birds and everything. I'm in a ... No one 
plays loud music, it's just I don't know I'm in the perfect building, I'm in a lovely building 
I love it. I really do. You hear stories. When I was a first year apprentice, I put in, I heard 
about Electchester I put in. They actually offered me an apartment, but I got offered an 
apartment in Manhattan so I'm like I goingto take this and live there, but once I had my 
daughter I'm like I can't live in a studio with a child. Me and her and her dad, I was like 
I'm goingto move to Electchester and I'm glad that I did. [00:50:00] It's convenient, the 
hall is there, I can make meetings or club meetings. I was never able to, I hated going to 
the hall. I knew nothing about Queens, I disliked Queens. Nothing adds up, the streets, 
court, lane, road, ave it's like the same numberyou get confused. 
I can get confused; I think Queens is an amazing place. 
Oh no, I'm from Brooklyn, no. Manhattan the numbers go up and they go across. It's like 
Queens I'm like everything is like I'm on Google like GPS everything. [00:50:30] Even if I 
know where I'm going I GPS it because I can't. Now I appreciate it because there's 
wildlife. I see snails, you don't see snails in Brooklyn, you don't see blue jays. I saw a 
cardinal, I was out of my mind when I saw the cardinal. I'm like, "It really looks like the 
bird on the team." Oh my gosh. The snail really blew my mind because it was really tiny 
and it was dark out. I was taking my daughter to the babysitter and it was like this is the 
step, it was on the side of the step. How did I see that? [00:51:00] I don't know, but 
when I came back out I was taking all these pictures of it so I could put it online. I saw 
the tiniest snail, it was so bizarre. 
Was it you that posted a picture of a hawk?

Yes, it was on my fire escape last week. Insane and it stayed there for about three or 
four hours. I'm like is this thing going to leave. I'm like I hope it's there when my 
daughter gets back. I didn't even take her outside, I was like, "Come upstairs, look, look, 
look." I showed it to her. I put her in the kitchen window and she's looking at it and she 
was like, "Why does it..." I was like, "It's looking for food. Do you hear any birds, do you 
see any squirrels?" She's like, "No." I'm like, "Because they know, [00:51:30] they put 
out the word." I saw squirrels do that before when the cat was outside and you hear the 
squirrels talk to each other and they stay up in the trees. I did not hear anything the 
whole time the bird was there, nothing it was just there looking for food. It was wild. I 
appreciate it now. 
Yeah, now it's a beautiful thing for you. 
Yes. 
In the future do you think your children or members of your community will do the 
same kind of [00:52:00] work that you're doing? 
My daughter, yes. I show her everything that I do and she's pretty handy too, she wants 
to get in there and do everything. There's certain things I'll do with her and certain 
things I won't. Anything that's a power tool, unless it's a drill I'll do that around her, but 
a bandsaw, saws or any of the articulating blades or anything that spins around and 
chops through anything, no. She will try to use it. 
I can see her, we do [00:52:30] a lot of I think it was the wellness club. We planted bulbs 
for tulips and flowers for a school in Brooklyn and her and my niece and nephew they 
got in there and I just showed them in there. Everyone thinks that I have three kids, I 
only have one, but they're always there so I just show them everything. If there's 
something that's Local Three and the kids can come I take them there to show them 
what's going on, what's happening. I got my niece and nephew in Little League with my 
daughter. [00:53:00] That's another thing a bout Electchester, she's in Little League. They 
have karate there and it's all free. The karate there, the dojo is free. She's going to be six 
soon. Yeah I'll send it in because I used to have her go into one that I was paying for 
because I wanted to do MMA, but yeah, I do. 
You still do. 
Yes. 
We have a few more minutes. I want to know some of those pictures, you have some 
pictures there and I wanted [00:53:30] to know what you thought about some of those 
pictures, if you could reflect off of some of those pictures. And if you have anything to 
ask that's burning. 
Oh wow, the time went fast too, I talk too much. 
No it's good.

What advice would you give someone to start to become an electrician?

Seta re Arashloo 
Kim Spicer: 
Well, I would tell them [00:54:00] definitely go to school. Try not to miss too many days 
because it's important. It really looks bad on you. Be careful. Watch your environment. 
Try not to spend beyond your means. That was one good thing that I learned at New, 
when they had an MU come in and speak, she said, "Don't live beyond your paycheck." 
When you get there and you see the guys that they'll do anything to stay employed even 
if it's dangerous, [00:54:30] don't risk your life forthe foreman orforthe shop because 
when you get hurt there will be another person right behind, you're just another 
number. You get hurt someone else is going to be right there and they're going to forget 
about you while you're laid up in the hospital or dead. 
Just be careful, be safe. That was one thing, pay attention look where you're going until 
you get the hang of it. Don't put your hands in your pockets, but now I'm like if it's cold 
my hands are in my pocket, but I know when to put [00:55:00] my hands in my pocket 
and when not to. If you got to catch yourself if you fall. 
So you have this picture up on your computer. Could you describe the photo and tell us 
what's going on? 
Yeah, these are 350's, the wire gauge. I thought it was bigger, but I see it's only 350. I 
was pulling, yes I believe I was pulling, yeah because it's bent. I was pulling the wire and 
I [00:55:30] think this was the year the upstairs pull and they kept telling me you're not 
supposed to straddle a ladder, but it's comfortable for me and I can really balance 
myself and hold on better than leaning against it, so I always straddle a ladder and I'm 
like take a picture of me. I was like this is pretty cool. I take the picture and then I got 
back to pulling. They were just like, "Kim pull." I'm like what the hell, I'm down here by 
myself and you guys are up there and I'm pulling this wire, but it was fun. That was a 
good job. [00:56:00] I really like that job. I pulled that wire. 
As you can tell I was brand new because I had on the wrong gloves. Those gloves were 
completely useless. I had on a pink hard hat. Never again, they can spot you anywhere 
with that thing so now I just try to blend in. I wear nice like a vintage rose, that's what 
they call it or a plum Carhartt to work, but if I'm at work, I'm blending in with the guys. I 
have on either a black or the regular Carhartt color. I need to blend in, I don't want them 
to spot me. 
[00:56:30] Low key undercover. 
Yes. Yes. Yes. 
: Do you ever customize your tool? 
Yes, two Christmases ago, because they never know what to buy me, I told my sister to 
buy me an engraver. I engrave all my Klein tools, because we for the most part all use 
Klein tools so I engrave all my tools. I got lucky and went into an Ace Hardware and saw 
a pink hammer and it was a real hammer. Bought that. This way because people like to 
Kim Spicer (2) 
Page 21 of 25 
walk off with your tools. So I [00:57:00] have strippers, there was a lock on it, but 
constantly I customize that by cutting that off. There's just certain things you have to 
make work for you. 
Jamie Lopez:

Kim Spicer: 
Do you have any other images that you really like? 
Oh gosh, this one was fun because I was second year and I was able to work by myself 
and put the sconces in, but I ended up blowing up my strippers because I was distracted 
by a shop steward [00:57:30] that was telling me about his divorce and what his wife 
was doing to him. And then when I blew it up he was like, "How did you do that?" I was 
like, "If you would shut up and let me pay attention to what I'm doing and work I 
wouldn't have blown this up." He's become a great friend of mine. I love this guy to 
death, he's a good shop steward. 
This was a nightmare. I was working with Wellsback and I had to crawl. It was tall at first, 
but then it got small. 
Who took that picture of you? 
This other guy John my partner. I was like you got to get a picture of this. I came home 
looking like a miner. [00:58:00] I was covered. Like this dirt is unnecessary. 
Do you say that often? You got to get a picture of this, you say that often? 
Yes, I need a picture of this. It was an ab workout. When I was done from top to bottom 
it hurt. I was just like oh my gosh because you were practically doingthe warm to get 
underneath there and inch your body underthere and I'm like I'm going to die. This is at 
Moynihan station. I'm like there's going to [00:58:30] be somebody down here living. 
They're like, "Oh no one's down here." Then I saw a Jordan and I'm like okay there's a 
Jordan sneaker down here, somebody's living down here. 
That was a trip. They said, "Oh it's only 100 feet." It was more than 100 feet. It might 
have been a thousand. I couldn't believe how far that thing went and then when the 
foreman came he was like, "Oh yeah it's pretty long." I'm like, "Jose, are you kidding 
me? Are [00:59:00] you serious right now bro?" Then he's like, but you got it done right. 
I was like I will never ever listen to you again for anything. 
That was an apprentice, right? 
No I was a journey woman. That's why I did it because if I was an apprentice I would 
have been like no, I don't feel safe. Yeah, no I did this as a journey person. Where was I 
at here? Oh yeah, when I started wea ring these I was with ... This is that ceiling I was 
talking about. This is nothing I should have took a better picture. You can't [00:59:30] 
even see this, but the bends are insane. I had to climb up there. I'm not a lightweight. 
And I'm up there on a Chicago bar and everything like a trapeze artist and I never bled 
so much on a job in my life. I was getting cut. They finally held up, but just slices

everywhere. We were walking around with bandaids. The good thing was that my 
apprentice was an EMT. 
He would stitch [01:00:00] you up. 
If I needed stitches he would have been there. He was pretty good. That job, that was at 
the Oculus. 
It's nice that you have been able to document your photos and yourself in them as well. 
Yeah, it's a nightmare. 
I'm going to ask you to share some of these. 
That's when I was pregnant. 
Oh my goodness. 
Some of these I was supposed to take out, I was supposed to take some out for you. I 
was eating a cannoli. That's another thing you end up on these jobs, these Italian 
[01:00:30] foreman they're like try this, and I'm like I don't like cheese and I try one I 
was like wow this is good so now I'm putting them away. 
Tell us about this shirt. 
All right, these shirts I had an old timer. He was like you got to wear Hawaiian shirt. I 
was like, "why?" Because I've heard about Hawaiian Fridays. I'm not wearing a Hawaiian 
shirt, but then when I realized how hot it was I'm like okay on Fridays I'm wearing the 
Hawaiian shirt because Fridays are forthe men and everyone wears their Hawaiian shirt. 
So I went on [01:01:00] Amazon and got me a bunch of Hawaiian shirts and thank 
goodness because as you can see I'm glistening here. It was very hot and I wasn't even 
in that crawl space and I'm sweating right there. All I was doing was using a magnetic 
drill to drill through steel and it takes forever and you're putting this little tube of oil on 
it and I'm just sitting there sweating. There's no exertion whatsoever, but I'm sweating 
just doing that and all I'm doing is turning something. That's the tube of whatever that 
stuff is. 
Hawaiian shirt Fridays has been a- 
That's a tradition. [01:01:30] Yeah I forgot about that, yeah. 
That's a tradition of Local Three. I guess it depends on who you're with. It could be 
something really engaging together unifying or it could be very distracting as well 
sometimes. Like sometimes people will be like oh look he's wearing Hawaiian shirt or 
she's wearing Hawaiian shirt they're probably not going to do too much work today. 
That too, yeah.

I think it's you know that it has- 
But they think you're going, yeah. 
Or it depends really on the crew on how unifying, how bea utiful that moment can be 
from my experience. 
[01:02:00] Yes. It is. There's one, I wish I knew where the picture was. I have on a shirt, I 
have a bunch of them and I had on a red and white one and when I left the Oculus and 
they sent me to the projects, my friend Luz who I knew from when I was a first year, she 
said, "We're in this [inaudible 01:02:14]." Everybody that was there had on the same 
color shirt. She sends it to me and I was like, "I got it on too." It was so funny and a 
weird coincidence that they had on the same shirt that I had on and they had it because 
I used to wear them. Yeah because I was there. 
And [01:02:30] they missed you. 
Yeah, it was really cool. Really cool moment. 
Please share these photos with us and share them with the archives. 
I will, I'll send you ... Not the multiples. 
Share us your favorites. 
Yes, because yeah. 
Make a really thing. Is there anything else that you want to add to this or anything you 
want to ask us? While you're thinking about it, actually one more question. 
Okay. 
What inspires you? 
[01:03:00] Inspires me, I don't know. I like to build and create things so I get inspired like 
maybe one of these days I'm going to do something really cool like today make 
something work. I love a challenge. Even though the three-way was a pain I like puzzles. 
I'm a puzzle person, video games everything. I love a challenge, so even though it was a 
pain because it should have been where it was at, the challenge would have been just 
getting it to work, but [01:03:30] now you got to trouble shoot. Just doing that sort of 
work. Just coming in, getting it done and you know just feeling proud in what you do. 
Sorry. Oh it's Barry. 
Hello Ms. Barrie Cline how are you?
