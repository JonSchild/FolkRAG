Introduction 
0.00.31 
Christina talks about where she grew up in Southwest Wisconsin on a dairy farm. 
She tells the story of how she ended up as a nurse; she got in an accident when 
she was four years old. After this experience, she told her mom she was going to 
be a nurse.  
0.01.55 
She was first generation college student; most of her family worked in factories or 
as dairy farmers.  
0.02.41 
In high school, her uncle gave her advised her to be strong in math and science 
and encouraged her to get a bachelor’s degree. “I watched my parents work so 
hard as a child. I just thought ‘I want something more out of life.’” She describes 
herself as a “Type-A” (personality) and she was first born, very motivated.  
0.04.14 
She talks about college; started at Marion College in Fond du Lac, but then went 
to Edgewood College in Madison. At that time, it was a new nursing program. 
Graduate with a BSN in 1984. In 2005, finished MA at Edgewood. Currently 
nursing instructor at Edgewood; finished DNP (Doctor of Nursing practice) there 
in 2017 with a focus on leadership. She clarifies that she does not have a Nursing 
Practitioner license; her degree is geared towards education.  
0.05.50 
She talks about memorable college experiences in nursing program wherein she 
and another student were picked to cut into a cadaver. “We made the first incision 
and hit metal, the wire they used to close the chest. I wanted to faint. We did it 
holding hands together as we went down to make that first … And yes, that was 
challenging.”  
0.07.28 
She talks about working as a nursing assistant (CNA) in a nursing home while she 
was in school. She wanted to get experience. “It just really helped with 
communication skills, comfort with interacting with clients.” She also worked in 
St. Mary’s hospital, which she states she enjoyed more. She talks about mentors 
there as she gained hands-on experience. She names other mentors that she 
worked with in Edgewood and at the hospital.  
0.09.43 
She describes the coursework for getting a BSN. She liked ortho-urology but 
didn’t get a job there. She talks about starting in labor and delivery at St. Mary’s, 
Page 2 of 6 
 
“To be honest, that’s my first love of nursing, labor and delivery.” She isn’t doing 
that right now in part due to long-hours “flipping the hours.”  
0.11.17 
She talks about getting married and moving into a clinic position, but the manager 
there caused her too much stress. “I had full-body hives and realized that’s not a 
healthy thing.” She moved back to hospital and worked part-time what she 
describes as “perking.” When talks about, at age 25, she started at a rural hospital 
where she became a unit director. States she wasn’t quite used to managing high 
risk babies. “There were times when we were calling an ambulance and 
transferring people because it was above our level of care.” “The hospital was 
very good at making sure people had advanced certification, but you’re not a 
Level Three center, so you need to have the processes in place to send your 
patients to a higher level of care.”  
0.12.59 
Charitie asks her to explain some of the terms used; for instance, clinic vs. 
hospital nursing for obstetrics (OB) and women’s health. She explains what 
“perk” means. “Maybe perking is an old term, but that is working in a position 
where you are very part-time. You do not have access to the benefits, but due to 
their staffing levels they need extra nursing staff, and you hire on as someone who 
fill in evening, nights, weekends, and occasional day shift when the organization 
needs that specifically trained nurse.” Not on-call, typically the nurse would sign 
up to a certain number of shifts per month. “You do want the consistency of 
working on the unit, obviously things are so complex in nursing. It’s so very 
different; everything is computerized now, and I just remember paper charting as 
a new grad. I’ll be honest, moving closer to my 60s I do miss paper charting.”  
0.15.38 
She talks about working part-time when she was faculty at Edgewood; she doesn’t 
do this anymore, now she volunteers when she has time at a rural free clinic.  
0.16.20 
She talks about how educational training versus on the job training and work 
experience. She describes how labor and delivery could be rewarding, but also 
very sad. “It’s that relationship, that support piece that I think is so very important 
as nurses. I’m not sure that many students, I think that some do have an 
opportunity to experience that, but I think a lot of times they might not until they 
get into practice or actually have those relationships maybe if they’re a nursing 
assistant.”  
0.18.20 
“I think it’s a learned process. I think it comes to some nurses much easier than 
others. People are wired so very differently and unfortunately, I do know some 
nurses, and it does make me very sad, who’ve gone into the profession for the 
money only. I struggle with that, but that’s their choice. That’s not why I’m 
there.” She’s talking here about the ability to build relationships and communicate 
effectively with patients.  
0.19.00 
Charitie asks about how she went from labor and delivery to working with the 
free clinic she mentioned earlier. She explains that she still couldn’t get a position 
at Labor and Delivery unit, so she moved into a unit director role at a rural 
hospital. She had a child, “I’ll be honest, there were a couple days I was there 
over 24, and the day that we moved into our new OB unit, I was there 36. I 
though ‘I’m not sure this is really healthy.’” She states she moved back into a 
clinical position, which she loved, in Madison and started working in infection 
control. She ran the infection control department after a while

00.20.56 
She talks about issues with her family that moved her to not work full-time, she 
moved to a rural hospital part-time, but didn’t like it so became a teacher at a tech 
school while she was working on her MSN.  
00.22.10 
She talks about working with two mentors who were doing mission work in 
Guatemala. Christina then traveled with them to Guatemala with nursing students. 
“It was an incredible experience.” She talks about what she learned from her 
experiences in Guatemala and how she realized that her own local community 
could benefit from her nursing skills. “I think unless somebody sometimes shakes 
you, you don’t see reality. I started looking at some of the need that I observed, 
this incredible need in Guatemala, and I was coming back after each trip, I started 
looking at what was going on in our country. I saw the huge challenges many 
people were facing with accessing healthcare and just accessing other resources 
like food and shelter. It was concerning.” She notes that her husband was rather 
stressed when she was gone on these trips, “I realized I couldn’t do that to him 
again. I’d been gone three weeks, that’s a long time. He said, ‘Chris, would you 
just open your eyes and look around you. I know this work is important to you, 
but you really need to start looking around your community. There’s so much 
need here. Find a gap and go there and work.’ I was really mad at him, I loved the 
opportunity to travel and learn about another culture, but he was right. That’s 
when I started volunteering at the free clinic. I have been there since 2011.”  
0.24.50 
“It is to me so very important to provide this service to people. There are so many 
people out there who do not have health insurance. Fortunately, Southwest 
Wisconsin Community Action Coalition has been able to put together a program 
where they facilitate mental health access at the free clinic where I serve … 
People who struggle with finances often struggle with anxiety and depression.” 
She talks about how her own family has needed services at the free clinic. “I feel 
those of us who have been blessed, who are not stressed with where their next 
meal will come from … I remember that in college, but I don’t have that issue 
now. We have a responsibility to try to help those who don’t have access. So, I 
think the free clinics we have in this state and throughout this nation are critically 
important to the health and wellbeing of our population.”  
0.26.34 
Charitie backs up to ask her a bit more about experiences in Guatemala to talk 
about how nursing differed between there and in the U.S. She gives a specific 
example of cultural differences; she worked with indigenous midwives. These 
were the woman, she states, who served rural communities in Guatemala who 
couldn’t go to a hospital. She describes various aspects of labor and delivery that 
they provided education on. She relays her “most memorable experience” in a 
mountainous area in a rural area where they were aiming to teach midwives about 
normal vs abnormal heart rates in mothers and newborns. “We made this 
assumption that they could tell time. What we learned was that they had no 
concept of time. We should have realized that; every time we would try to meet 
with somebody we’d end up waiting. The U.S. populace, we’re so focused on it 
has to be done now, where in other cultures that is not the way it is, and you need 
to understand that life is different.” She describes how they helped the midwives 
assess the heart rates by using drums. [She taps on the table in a steady rhythm as 
an example].

“You have to be able to shift how you teach. Everybody can learn what you need 
to teach them, you just have to make sure that you can share that concept in a way 
that makes that connection.” Importance of creative solutions, especially in free 
clinic.  
0.30.33 
“I try to be creative. I know I should be much more creative in the classroom. I 
think just with interacting with clients in the community, just these experiences 
have taught me, you have to be open. Do not judge anybody. I have no right in 
judging anyone. I don’t know their story.” She talks about her doctoral research, 
which was related to the free clinic. She relays how students have reported being 
affected by their time in the free clinic. “They were able to look through a 
different lens and realize the different resources that needed to be required.”  
0.31.38 
She talks about a student nurse that she worked with who was finishing up his 
BSN; in his case, he realized that nurses, not just social workers, also need to help 
facilitate resources for patients.  
0.33.20 
Christina talks about how the free clinic differs from other places she’s worked, 
for example because people don’t have insurance she sees “very advanced 
pathology.” She tells a story about a patient that illustrates issues with lack of 
prevention and advances diagnoses; this was an individual with an umbilical 
hernia. The staff recommended surgery, but he didn’t have any money. “We never 
saw him after that. I don’t know if he went home to die. That was gut wrenching.”  
0.35.03 
She tells a story about a student to illustrate how poverty affects health; her 
student was working with a man who needed certification for a CDL license, but 
his blood pressure was too high. “When you are working in a clinic, typically 
people are not in those dire situations. Not to say that you don’t see a few people, 
but we see this much more frequently in the free clinic …”  
0.37.20 
She talks about how she tries to communicate with patients with these advanced 
illnesses. “When I know that there’s nothing else I can do, I honestly go home and 
pray for them because I don’t have any other resources.” She praises her nurse 
manager for “doing her best” but knows they can’t always achieve what they 
want. 
0.38.44 
“It’s unfortunately the reality of our day.” She talks about increases in cost of 
healthcare; she held insurance “for just a few dollars a month” when she was still 
in school working part time. “But that is not anyone’s lived experience in 2019.”  
0.40.00 
Charitie asks about how the different roles in a hospital work together. How do 
nurses fit in? “The nurses are the boots on the ground. They are typically one of 
the first interactions with the client. It’s very important for a nurse to develop a 
relationship quickly because it is scary to walk into a facility.” She talks about 
developing trust. “She is much more able to help a client through whatever 
process they are looking at.” She talks about necessity of working with social 
workers, dietary staff, nutritionists, etc. Important for all to work together “for the 
common good of the clients we serve.” Acknowledges that there can be tension, 
she talks about seeing times when older nurses were “very short” with the 
residents. States that nurses need to be patient and need to be teachers. “We need 
to treat each other respectfully at all times.” Communication is critical, respect 
and strong leadership.

0.42.50 
Christina talks about getting students to learn how to communicate. “We can 
share all the theory we want to share, but until you really get into those situations 
and experience it … I think you have the background, which is important, but 
providing students and opportunity to see the importance of working collegially.” 
She states her passion is to get her students as much experience as possible, so 
they are prepared for various situations. Her students do evening shifts with her at 
the free clinic, a county jail, public health department, and a food pantry. “I want 
them to understand the challenges.” She tells a story about a patient she had in a 
county jail who dealt with substance abuse following an accident. She emphasizes 
to her students to learn what each patients’ history is. “It’s makes me so terribly 
sad that because my children are blessed with these resources that they can walk 
this path when someone else walks another path.” (i.e. that her children have 
healthcare and the patient in the story didn’t).  
0.46.50 
She explains that her department supports the types of clinicals she does and how 
the “five pillars” of Edgewood facilitate her work in social justice.  
0.48.10 
She talks about gaining her MSN which is in nursing education and other 
specializations that Edgewood offers. Her doctorate had a leadership focus. “We 
were trained to be nurse leaders.”  
0.49.30 
Charitie asks how has nursing changed over her career. “Knowledge and the 
content that we make these nursing students cover during their education is 
significantly increased since I was an undergrad. The stress of nursing school has 
definitely gone up because the amount of concepts and the variety of information 
that you need to be aware of.” She thinks that there is pressure to avoid patients’ 
readmission. “Do more with less. That’s all I’ve heard for the last I don’t know 
how many years. At some point, there’s a breaking point. Younger nurses are very 
stressed with that challenge.” She talks about “patient load” and how many clients 
nurses can manage. She states that nursing can be exhausting with 12 hours shifts 
and the issue above of doing less with more.  
0.52.19 
She states that in nursing school educators do talk about “self-care” to cope with 
stress but thinks that it depends on the unit, which can go back to the leadership. 
A manager might not be effective and there are more struggles, for example with 
staffing turnover. Her nephew works in an ICU as a nurse, she talks about the 
stress of working in trauma. She describes an older friend of hers who works in a 
neuro-ICU. “How does she do these 12 hour shifts with such grace. You had to 
lose these nurses because there’s a lifetime of knowledge there.” She states that 
working in a hospital is challenging. “People want a work-life balance.” Suggests 
maybe some of it is generational. She states that the average age of nurses right 
now skews older.  
0.55.33 
The states that the big issue in training new nurses is a lack of faculty. Faculty are 
not paid as much as other nurses, for example those in hospitals. If you want to 
keep teachers, they need to get paid more equally, she says. This is an ongoing 
problem. She talks about the number of students in Edgewood’s nursing program. 
She states that nursing programs in the area compete for clinical spots.  
0.59.02 
She gives some advice to high school students; take math and science courses. 
She strongly encourages everyone to learn Spanish; she studied Spanish in high 
school and in Guatemala and she uses it frequently at the free clinic. We talk 
Page 6 of 6 
 
about issues with language lines and interpreters, some patients don’t like having 
3rd party translators.  
01.01.04 
I feel very blessed at the free clinic that we are able to offer those mental health 
services. We’re very fortunate that we have organizations that are motivated to try 
to ensure that care is provided in Southwest Wisconsin.”   
01.01.47 
Charitie follows up on the mental health piece. “To be honest, when I was a labor 
and delivery nurse, I didn’t really deal with anxiety or depression that often. 
Personally, I struggled with post-partum depression. But on a hospital unit, you 
don’t have an opportunity to see a client for a long period of time. I know there 
were a few cases of postpartum depression when I was working in the clinic. 
What you see in the free clinic, you see many people struggling with anxiety, you 
see many people struggling with depression. Obviously, for me, it comes back to 
what are their resources. If they’re coming to the free clinic, I don’t know how 
many people are food insecure. Many of them work a couple of jobs, so there’s 
incredible stress.” A lack of resources results in a lot of stress. “We need to better. 
We want to throw drugs at people all the time and I struggle with that.” She talks 
about the connection between healthy food and mental health. She describes how 
all these systems are intertwined. 
01.04.39 
Working at the free clinic, “It’s made me more aware of the challenges people 
face and it’s increased my passion to make sure my students understand that so 
that when they are in those hospital and clinic settings, when they have access to 
those resources, they’re better able to understand what they need to do or at least 
who to ask.” She states that all nurses students have at least one course in mental 
health.
