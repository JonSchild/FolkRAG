17E-A2&3W. F. A-NUTTING WE WILL GO Come all you jolly follows who would like to hear a song,just
sit you down beside me, I'll not detain you long.'Tis of a gay young farmer who went forth his lands
to plow,Harnessed up his horses and he turned out all his cows,Saying, "A-nutting we will go, my
boys, nutting we will go;With a white cockade all in our hate, we'll cut a gallant show."Now there
being a fair maiden who was nutting in the woods,And his notes were so melodious, they charmed
her as she stood.She boldly stepped up to him and said to him, "My dear,You are the finest singer
that ever I did hear."Oh, a-nutting we will go, my boys, nutting we will go;With a white cockade
all in our hats, we'll cut a galliant show. [?] [He?] took her to a shady spot as arms she wrapped
around,Said she, "Charlie, I think I see this world go round and round."Oh, a nutting they did go, my
boys, a nutting they did go;With a white cockades all in our hats we'll cut a galliant show.Now Charlie
went back to his horses, to plow he started in,When she said, "Charlie dear, I'd like to see this world
go round again."So a nutting they did go, my boys, a nutting they did go;With a white cockades all in
our hats we'll cut a galliant show. ©

the world was round?]
