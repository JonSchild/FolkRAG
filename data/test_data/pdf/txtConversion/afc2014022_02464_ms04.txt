Interviewee: Cushing, Carl 
Interviewer: Andy Kolovos 
Interview Date: April 15, 2015 
Interview Location: Vermont Livestock Slaughter and Processing 
 
This is another interview in a series aimed at exploring the network of growers and 
producers who supply Fletcher Allen Hosptial/University of Vermont Medical 
Center. I was put in touch with Carl Cushing through Mark Boyden of Boyden Farm.  
VT Livestock and Slaughter processes his cattle. 
 
Carl’s business functions in an older slaughtering facility in Ferrisburgh, VT, just off 
Rt. 7.Carl is a friendly, amiable man and an excellent storyteller. Carl met with me in 
the break room and spent over an hour talking.  Our conversation ended just as the 
lunch break began and employees started entering the room. I wanted to get a sense 
of both his background and how he got into the slaughter and meat processing 
business as well as get an overview of how his business operates and how it fits into 
the landscape of the industry in Vermont. 
 
Carl had a lot to say—all of it valuable.  He represents an older generation currently 
engaged in agricultural work in VT, a Vermont native from Milton who has worked 
in agricultural pursuits for all his working life, and has watched the industry ebb 
and flow over the course of his long career in meat inspection and running his own 
business. 
 
Carl’s a good talker and I think he’d make a great addition to a panel discussion on 
agriculture in the state.
