 [13:00] DM gives a brief history of Sam Houston tour; the boat was built in 1958 for the Port 
Authority. Its main mission is to educate the public about the Port of Houston; a free boat tour, 
it is the best opportunity for the public to see the channel up close and observe the day-to-day 
operations of the docks. Talks about the upgrades made to the boat after 50 years of serving 
the public.

15 miles. Sometimes the tour changes its course due to traffic in the ship channel. DM talks
