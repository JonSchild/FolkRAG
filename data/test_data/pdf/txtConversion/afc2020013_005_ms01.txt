Early memory of going to the speedway: kids from Tuscarora going to the track 
About 50 years ago, when five or six, went to see a family friend race there (Dave 
Edgerton), who used to come pick us up and everyone’d go to the track 
Popularity of racing on Tuscarora: bigger in the past, not as much now 
Always someone from Tuscarora racing, and remembers always going to root for 
hometown guy or guy living around the corner from them 
Rivalries and competition being more something on the track than off the track

cylinder 
Being able to source parts from the junkyard, and working at a junkyard in high

Memories from Pro Stock Career and Moving into BRP Late Models 
Memorable finishes include second in Ransomville on points and championship 
at Genesee towards end of career, and finishing in top 3 at Syracuse 
Description of Syracuse, the track at the Syracuse Fairgrounds used to be called 
the ‘Moody Mile’. Pretty dangerous, not designed for racing really 
In 2006 sold car to a guy in Connecticut, and moved into the BRP late model 
class, also known as the super stocks at Genesee Speedway 
Had a cousin down the road, Neil Patterson, who raced at Genesee Speedway in 
the late model class 
Found a car for sale down in Salamanca and then got in touch with a racing 
supply store in PA (late model bigger in PA) 
Description of his BRP late model, which was based on camaro stock stub like 
pro stock at the time 
BRP late model being not a ‘full late model’; like an underclass to the late model 
Lighter, 4-500 pounds, better suspension, but carried full late model body  
Ran it for few years, did well but never won in late model.  
 
[29:20]   
Winding down of BRP Late Model Career 
2nd year he ran BRP late model, it was dropped by Ransomville, which was his 
home track (only 8 miles away) 
Other Late model tracks were 3 hours away (except for Genessee Speedway) 
Difficulty in balancing that long distance driving for racing and his work 
schedule (as an ironworker), coming back too late at night and needing to wake 
up for work in the morning 
Stopped running BRP late models around 2008   
 
[31:50]   
Selling BRP Late Model and Moving into Sportsman Class  
Sold the BRP late model and purchased a car from Randy Williamson, engineer, 
designer, etc. of modifieds at Bicknell 
Discussion of difficulty / cost of jumping from pro stock to modifieds, need 
backing from big sponsors, and there always being a stepping stone into next 
class 
Saw next class up from pro stock or limited late model as the sportsman 
Purchased sportsman in 2009 from Randy Williamson that was driven by his son 
Matty Williamson 
Sportsman at that time was around when GM crate motors were coming out 
 
[34:30]  
(paused recording as mike went to put his beagle into her crate for remainder of 
interview) 
 
[34:35]  
Sportsman Class Overview and Moving into Modifieds 
Deciding to go into sportsman as could afford it and work it into schedule for 
racing at home track on Friday night 
Late 2016 had opportunity to purchase a 358 which could put him into the 
modified division, something always wanted to do growing up and watching 
guys race modifieds 
Racing modifieds for few years but moving back to  
 
[37:05]   
Modifieds and Return to Sportsman 
Racing modifieds for few years but moving back to sportsman for 2020 
Discussion of his time in modified division, competing against lot of good young 
drivers with great equipment, and technical challenge of learning new setups 
Being 55 and maybe racing another 5 six years, decided to go back to what he 
knows and can learn; knowing sportsman division and the technical ins and outs 
of it better 
With modified racing, ‘If you don’t have the whole package, you’re just out there 
riding around.’   
Didn’t really do well, so decided to move back to the sportsman after 
selling/swapping everything back down 
 
[40:45]   
Change in Traveling 
Used to travel a lot, racing at the other tracks, but have been having trouble 
getting into a rhythm 
Focusing more on Ransomville/his home track 
Deciding to take summer of 2020 off, wasn’t same racing without the fans in the 
stands 
Putting new body on the trailer, but not lettered yet, and having basically a 
brand new motor (only 25 laps on it from that one practice) 
Waiting on 2021 for racing  
 
[42:40]   
Importance of Time Spent in Garage & Typical Week In Season 
Everybody, especially pit crew, everybody wants to go on Friday night 
Races not being won on Friday Night, but one Saturday morning, Monday night, 
Tuesday midnight, etc. 
Importance of all the other work that goes into the car 
Keeping it clean, going through everything to make sure that it’s quirks free  
Thursday night scale night, having it on scale to write everything down  
Getting home from work around 4 o’clock, and going straight to work on the car 
Trying to get everything done that Thursday night, so don’t have to worry about 
it during the day on Friday, and not doing stuff on Friday after work 
Difficulty of getting car ready during the week when had a wreck or crash 
previous week 
Loading everything up on Thursday night, so Friday can just go in the truck after 
getting off work – sometimes around 5/530, and head to the track getting there 
by 6 
 
[48:55]   
Race Day Walkthrough 
Step-by-step of how a typical race day unfolds for him, starting with arrival in 
pits, unloading the car with a winch, and setting up area tools like the desiccant 
air dryer and compressor 
Setting helmet down and description of the tearoffs, and why they’re important 
to have on helmets for dirt racing, using about five  
Description of putting the last tearoff on backwards so it can’t be taken off, helps 
to protect the shield 
Attending the Driver’s meetings, usually when everybody gets yelled at (jokes), 
talking about cautions, etc. but if someone is having problems driving though 
(like adjusting or something, e.g. being in new class) they will talk to them on the 
side / not in front of everyone 
Discussion of the pill draw system at Ransomville, and how lineups, heat, and 
features work 
 
[1:02:45]  
Track Condition and Setup for Car 
Ransomville being a heavy clay (dirt) track, and at its best it’s like modeling clay. 
Because of dirt changing throughout the night sometimes the heats are at a faster 
speed than the features 
 
 
Discussion of stagger on cars 
 
[1:06:20]  
Skills and Technique as a Driver 
As a driver, limited adjustments can do in the car while you’re driving. like back 
brake vs. front brake, keeping car straighter coming out of turn, etc. 
Discussion of the momentum behind sportsman and racing, and it ‘not being just 
about putting your foot to the floor’ 
Description of the phrase ‘putting your horsepower into the ground’, and 
planting wheels in the track, and not spinning them 
Being able to anticipate a wreck, seeing someone not handling well or ‘driving 
over their head’ (e.g. all out with blinders on), just waiting for that mistake, 
driving through the wreck or around it 
Mental games are also a thing, especially with newer drivers, giving them a little 
tap to let them know you’re there 
 
[1:11:40]  
Memories of Wrecks 
Anecdote of a mistake he made during a heat trying to pass a friend’s kid who 
was a rookie driver 
In depth walkthrough of a bad wreck that he had, flipping his car in 2018 at 
Ransomville 
Importance of coming back from a wreck and not being afraid: have to be all in, 
always and can’t just race to not wreck 
 
[1:25:08]  
Memorable Races and Victories 
Most memorable being his last year in pro stock, winning championship at 
Genesee was an accomplishment; stepson helping with car that time too, and it 
felt like won it together with his stepson and other guys that helped too 
Also finishing second on points in Ransomville that year  
Won some races in the sportsman 
In depth description of a memorable race he had at Ransomville in a pro stock, 
and the battles during the race trying to go bottom and/or top 
 
[1:30:15]  
Off Season Work on the Car & Camaraderie in Racing 
Always working on car in off season, but some months might end up hanging 
out and talking more with crew than specific work on car 
Best thing about racing is the people and friends that you make and the 
camaraderie 
Reflecting on how although racing season isn’t full year, work is full year 
The feeling of getting into a car on that first night, at home track, it’s like being 
home, and especially walking around and seeing all the same folks.  
 
[1:32:50]  
Advice for Future Driviers 
Advises to not take it to serious, which can be hard when it is a competitive 
thing, especially at a young age (anecdote from his own experience in his 20s) 
Importance of balancing family and life around racing too, and having seen 
relationships and friendships break down because of racing which it shouldn’t 
Understanding the time commitment during the week and offseason, that it isn’t 
just a Friday night race 
Learning to enjoy where you are at in skill at all times, because next year, that 
might have been your best year as someone might come around next year and be 
consistently better than you 
 
[1:36:15]  
Competition in Racing and Closing Thoughts on Community in Racing 
Discussion of how sometimes things do get heated in the pit area, and rules that 
don’t allow you to go to another guy’s pit 
Competitive nature of motorsports and driving especially when something 
happens on the track because it is just you out there so it feels personal 
Important to try and not let emotions get better of you, and knowing that a fight 
or bad feeling is going to last lot longer than your emotions 
Despite competition and things getting heated, after a while become friends and 
do make friendships beyond just being competitors 
Anecdote of not realizing when he started out that everybody got paid if you 
make it into the feature, and learning from other drivers after his third week with 
them asking why he didn’t go get paid (didn’t realize he’d be getting paid) 
Being thankful for managing to stay safe through all his bad wrecks
