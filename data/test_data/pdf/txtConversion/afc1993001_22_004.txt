The East Harlem  usic School  : Music of the Urban Caribbean
 
A report to the American Folklife Center,  Library of Congress,  on
 
field research conducted between April and July,  1982 by Morton Marks
 
as part of the 77hniC Lannsage and Heritage Schools  Research Project.
 
Manhattan's East 104th Street is sometimes called  the His-
panic Culture Block -
 at Fifth Avenue is the Museo del Barrio
 
and the Performing Arts Department of Boys' Harbor (with Kubat ,
 
an Afro-Cuban performance group in residence), and at number 1??
 
between Lexington and Third Avenues,  is the East Harlem Music
 
School.
 It occupies a converted building that fo rme rly housed
 
the 23rd Police Precinct, and has been at this location since
 
1980.
 Prior to that,  classes were held in public schools,  in-
cluding PS 121 on East 103rd Street and Junior Hirr

The East Harlem Music School was founded in 1972 by Johnny
 
Colon, whose idea for the school began as far back as 1963:
 
"
I saw young kids hanging out on the street corners with nothing
 
t
o do but loaf, drink and maybe shoot up.
 But I also saw them
 
keeping time and pounding out rhythms on whatever was in sight.
 
Now that's an indication of talent,  of a special kind of in-
heritance that's  in our blood -
 and it shouldn't go to waste.
 
So I wrote a proposal, highly emotional,  asking for funding for
 
my project.
 Nothing much happened until my recording (Bugaloo
 
Blues) hit, and then somebody that knew my music, who also held

an influencial position, helped me swing the projec:_
 We' - e
 
been going strong ever since"
 (from an intervie w  in the maga-
zine Latin New York, December,  1978).
 
The present program was started with funding from the New
 
York City Youth Board as a pilot project to service forty-five
 
young people.
 By the end of the two month contract,  the number
 
had increased to one hundred and nineteen.
 Since then,  the
 
school's programs have expanded to service more than one thou-
sand five hundred students in forty-two group classes and in
 
private classes offered at nominal fees.
 
In 1975,  the school was incorporated by New York State as
 
a not-for-profit corporation.
 The staff has grown from one
 
full-time executive director and seven part-time music teachers,
 
operating two nights a week from 7 to  9 P.M.,  to its present
 
full-time staff of five and a part time staff of twenty music
 
teachers.
 The school now operates five days a week from 2 P
.M.
 
to 10 P.M., and on Saturdays from 10 A.M.  to L
i
. P.M.
 
Besides offering classes in trumpet,  trombone,
 
flute, violin,
 
piano,  saxophone
 acoustic and electric bass, guitar,  cuatro
  
(a ten-string folk guitar of rural Puerto Rico), voice/coro
 
(chorus),  timbales,  the conga drum and music theory,  the school
 
has also added a workshop band and a professional orchestra.
 
These serve as training vehicles for the students and,  through
 
concert appearances,  they provide earned income for the corpor-
ation.
 
Aims of the School
  
According to Stephanie F.  de Mu oz,  the school's administra-
I
arks  -

tive director,  there are three  "missions of the East Harlem Music
 
School:  "1).  to teach  '
Latin' music;  2
).  to teach Hispanics and
 
non-Hispanics the history of  'Latin' music and the contributions
 
of African and Spanish sources to the development of this music
 
in New York City;  and 3
). to promote  'Latin' music as a cultural
 
foL m"
 (from interview tape ES-82 -MM-C3,  l86-20 ).
 
But the whole notion of "Latin" music is a problema -ic one,
 
and since it is so tied up with the maintenance of Hispanic
 
identity in New York City,  I must deal with it in a special sec-
tion below.
 
Ethnic Comrosition of ohe Student Body: 
When I asked Stephanie about the ethnic breakdown of the
 
student body,  she replied,  "
 80% of the students are Hispanic,
 
and until two or three years ago,  80% of those were Puerto Rican.
 
The rest were Cuban and Dominican, with some from mainland Sou -'
-
America,  especially Colombia and Ecuador.
 Within the last two
 
years,  there's been a tremendous change.
 Half of the  '
Hispanics'
 
are not Puerto Rican at all,  they're Ecuadorians or Colombians.
 
This change has come about because of a

 They want to learn music, 
new immigration pa: eru.
 
because they want
 
and this is the on,
 
place in New York City where they can get training in Spanish"
 
from tape CJ,  506).
 
Language:

available in ei t
her English or Spanish.
 Music classes are taught
 
in either language, depending on the percentage of those whose
 
preferred language is Spanish or English.
 A single class, for
 
example, may include people in their forties and fifties whose
 
first language is Spanish or who have an excellent command of
 
that language;  students ("Newyoricans") who were born in New
 
York but who speak Spanish well,  even if it is not their firs:
 
language;  and teen-agers of Puerto Rican descent who know little
 
or no Spanish.
 
Thus,  instructors often find themselves teaching in three
 
language varieties:  formal Spanish,  "
Spanglish" (
 characterized
 
by heavy code-switching and lexical borrowings between the two),
 
and English.
 
The language issue has only become problematic in the last
 
few years, because many students are arriving from mainland South
 
American countries with little or no knowledge of English.
 Until
 
that time,  classes were taught in English with some Spanish code-
switching.
 Younger students who knew English would translate
 
for older ones whose command of English was weak.
 
Clientele: 
The typical student (in 1982)  is male, Hispanic and between
 
the ages of .
'
fourteen and thirty.
 Until 1979,
 when an effort
 
was made to increase the number of female students,  this profile
 
fit about 90% of the student body.
 Since then, female instruc-
tors in trumpet,  conga, dance and voice have been added, along
 
with classes  that were more apt to attract females  (voice, violin,
 
'ance and guitar 1 .  Besides the 80% Hispanic enrollment men-
1
oned earlier,  there are 10% American Blacks and 10%  "others"
 
:1
 azz musicians).
 
er ence and  "
Creolization" in the
  
Rico to the mainland,  the W.P.A.  Guide to New York City
 
oorted the following:  "Though called Spanish Harlem,  this
 
strict is not the home of Spaniards,  but of Latin Americans....
 
Living in the Harlem quarter side by side are Puerto Ricans, Cubans,
 
American Negroes, West Indian Negroes, South Americans and Mexicans.
 
Puerto Ricans are  the overwhelming majority, numbering about one
 
hundred thousand persons, or 85% of the area's population" (from
 
the W.P.A. Guide to New York City, re-issued in New York by Pantheon
 
Books,  1982;  pp.  265-266).
 
While El Barrio has expanded into what had been Italian
 
Harlem, and the Puerto Rican population has established itself
 
in other parts of Manhattan, Brooklyn and the Bronx,  this particular
 
section of Manhattan has been the setting for various kinds of
 
cultural exchanges,  both intra-Hispanic and Hispanic-Black,  since
 
the 1930's.
 It is against this background that the East Harlem
 
Music School may be best understood.
 The development of an urban
 
popular culture,  the shifts that have taken place in Hispanic
 
self-definition and the urbanization process itself are all close-
ly connected.
 It should also be stressed that perhaps to a greater
 
extent than among any of the other ethnic groups studied in this
 
project, music is  the most heavily equated with culture and ethnic

a his book The Latin Tinge, subtitled the Imract of Latin
  
_­- -
an Music on the United States, John Storm Roberts writes:
 
'
A very important counterbalance to the downtown groups like Cugat's
 
by the bands playing in El Barrio. . . .East Harlem served
 
new musicians, a gateway for innovation from Cuba
 
and elsewhere, a place where more purely Latin styles were played,
 
and a workshop for fusions of a very different nature from the
 
Bin-Pan-Alley, mass-popular oriented downtown versions.
 
"By 1930, East Harlem had already developed much of the infra-
structure for a flourishing musical life.
 The area's first Latin
 
dance was held in 1930, when a Puerto Rican civic association
 
rented the Golden Casino on 110th Street and Fifth Avenue for the
 
night. . .  .
A definite diversity was beginning to develop even  '
up
 
town'  some bands playing more strictly Cuban-derived music, and
 
others beginning to blend Latin and American elements.
 But this
 
division was never clear-cut. . .  .El Barrio musicians were developing
 
the crossover between black and Latin music that was so natural,
 
given the strong Afro-Cuban element in the dance music"  (from
 
Nhe Latin Tinge by John Storm Roberts,  Oxford University Press,
 
New York 1979, pp.  88 -89).
 
Johnny Col n himself, whose 1965 hit  "Boogaloo Blues" was a
 
cross-over between "Latin"  (really Cuban) forms and black rhythm-
and-blues,  is part of this tradition.
 The music taught now at
 
the East Harlem Music school has gone through so much prior
 
"
creolization" that what is now presented as  "Hispanic" is  the
 
end product of a Long series of coavergina traditions.
 
arks  -7.
 
For now,  the definicion of a "
creole' that I am using means
 
that the structure has arisen from more than two sources.
 One
 
of these sources  (Afro-Cuban music) has become the  "target" form
 
and a kind of linEua franca for non-Cuban Hispanics, whose
 
presence in the music have altered its structure somewhat.
 And
 
because this music  is now something like a "first language  for
 
number of students at the school (New York-born Puerto Ricans)
 
fulfills another necessary condition required by a "creole."
 
t only does this approach explain some of the structural fea-
res of urban "salsa," it also explains how a Dominican-born
 
sician named Johnny Pacheco could spread a "pure" Cuban music
 
an audience of New York-born Puerto Ricans in the  '
60's.
 
My thesis is  that Afro-Cuban music,  transformed in New York
 
ty by Puerto Ricans and others, has been an urbanizing and pan-
Hispanic form.
 A kind of musical "spectrum shift" has taken
 
place along with its spread.
 By this I mean that the  "Afro"
 
end of the spectrum has become the urban and urbanizing cutting
 
edge, and the "Iberian" end (represented,  for example,  by ,
lIbaro
  
or rural Puerto Rican music), has become either nostalgia,  the
 
remnant of a musical repertoire that still marks Chris L
mas and
 
other celebrations,  or else has become politicized.
 
This issue of musical style as political metaphor is an
 
interesting one,  and I will return to it later.
 
What is also interesting is that Afro-Hispanic forms are
 
spreading into Spanish-speaking areas in the United States,
 
Central and South America that have little or no local African-
derived culture.
 This becomes significant as  "
salsa" spreads

Sources of Caribbean Music in New York -
 Culture Zones and husic 
Three of the major sources of Hispanic migration to New York
 
City,  Puerto Rico,  Cuba and the Dominican Republic,  are rou h1y
 
divisible into culture zones.
 In Puerto Rico,  the north and
 
south coasts are  (or were) musically more  "Afro," and the mountainous
 
interior is more Iberian.
 For the Dominican Republic,  the nor7'--
ern region,  the Cibao,  is more Iberian,  the south more  "
Afro."
 
(In 1981 in San Cristobal, a town near the capital,  I recorded
 
identifiably Congo drumming styles.)
 Cuba's Oriente Province
 
is the more iberian zone, while Matanzas Province and  the area
 
around Havana are more heavily Afro-Cuban.
 
These cultural differences are the result of se:ciemerat p
 
terns, and they often reflect a dichotomy between what were pla
 
tation zones and areas of small f a r m s.
 The Cuban author Fernando
 
Ortiz has called this phenomenon "the counterpoint between to-
bacco and sugar, between the Spanish-descended small farmer (of-
ten of tobacco),  and the African or Afro-Cuban slaves who worked
 
the sugar centrales (industrialized plantations).
 The musical
 
consequences of these differences were far-reaching,  and are
 
important for what later took place in New York City,  the point
 
of convergence for these and other Hispanic musical cultures.
 
Since people of Puerto Rican descent are by far the largest
 
Spanish-speaking group in the New York area,  I will begin with a
 
brief discussion of Puerto Rican musical culture.
 The m aj o r
 
African-derived coastal foL-ms are the bomba and the alena.

The traditional bonba is a couple dance,  played on an ensemble
 
that includes cu.  (rhythm sticks), and two or three barrel-shaped
 
drums.
 The lower-pitched ones  (seguidoras) play a fixed support
 
rhythm, while the higher pitched drum (the r

like the African "master drummer."
 
The plena is also considered to be an African-derived form,  but
 
it incorporates more European elements,  including a harmonica or
 
accordion as a melody instrument.
 A minimal plena ensemble would
 
include two seguidoras, one requinto, a g
iiiro (scraper) and a
 
melody instrument.
 (Recordings made by the singer Manuel Jimenez,
 
known as  "El Canario," also included a clarinet and sometimes a
 
trumpet.
 He recorded in New York in the  'thirties.)
 
The mountainous interior of Puerto Rico was a major source
 
fo
-r the migration to N.Y.
 So-called  "
jibaro" (hill-billy)  music
 
is largely of southern Spanish derivation and is mostly based on
 
string instruments.
 Even the harmonies of this guitar and cuatro
  
music are identifiably Andalusian:  "Their harmony is based on
 
the tonic, dominant and sub-dominant, although the  jfbaro often
 
converts the dominant into the tonic, a characteristic of
 
Spanish music, where it is known as the tônica espa ola, or
 
Spanish tonic"(frorn notes to El Arte de Ramito, a recordir
'
 
issued by the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture).
 
Listening to  this rural music,  or even to the plenas re-
corded in New York City in the 30's, you soon realize that not
 
an echo of them is  to be found in the East Harlem Music School
 
In fact, what the  students there call  "our music'  has quite a
 
different source.
 The path leads back not to Puerto Rico, but
 
to Cuba.
 The music known as  "salsa" has a largely Cuban base,
 
and the percussion section of the Johnny Col6n workshop band,
 
as well as the charanga band  in its entirety, are derived from
 
Cuban sources.
 
The Intervention of Cuban yusic in the Develoomeno of Salsa
 
While this is not the place to attempt a history of Cuban
 
music or of salsa,  some salient features must be pointed out.

is Cuban music that intervenes in the development of a "Latin'
 
or pan-Hispanic dance music in New York City that is now being
 
taught at the East Harlem Music School.
 
Because of the intense development of the Cuban sugar centrales  
in the nineteenth century, large numbers of slaves were brought
 
in until near the end of the last century (slavery didn't end
 
in Cuba until 1886).
 Because so many slaves arrived and were
 
concetrated in a relatively small area,  the cabildos (mutual-aid
 
societies established along ethnic or "tribal" lines) were able
 
to maintain a vast amount of traditional African culture.
 TWO
 
of the major groups, whose influence is still felt in popular
 
Cuban and now in New York Hispanic culture, were the Lukumis
 
(of Yoruba descent) and the Congos  (whose  nce tors  came from
 
what is now Zaire and the north of Angola).
 
But a i
rery Andalusian music flourished among the  
 
the small farmers of eastern Cuba and the equivalent of tb
 
Puerto Rican jibaros. 
his gualiro music was  guitar-based, and alongside it there
 
;
zl:ped the son,  a rural black music that included a tres (
 a
 
x or nine-stringed guitar), a laf
ld (lute), and various percussion
 
struments.
 Early son ensembles featured marfmbulas (
 a large
 
:
humb piano"),  claves (two sticks that are struck together to
 
ovide a continuous time-line), botija (
 an earthenware jug
 
at is blown into), bong s (two small drums  joined together and
 
played with the hands) and maracas.
 
As the son moved into western Cuba and became urbanized,
 
its instrumentation changed and expanded.
 The boti. a was dropped
 
and was replaced by a string bass.
 The laid was dropped as well,
 
but the other instruments remained.
 To them was added a trumpet.
 
By the 1930's,  the son became immensely popular within Cuba
 
and abroad.
 It quickly spread to Puerto Rico,  the Dominican
 
Republic (where Eduardo Brito recorded Dominican sones in the
 
'
30's), Mexico, Central America and elsewhere in Latin America.
 
In fact,  the son (sometimes confusingly called  "rumba" by
 
Northamericans in the 30's) may be an early example of a pan-
Hispanic musical form.
 In many ways,  it forms the basis for
 
the music that became known as  "salsa."
 
The equation that I have made between "urbanization" and
 
"Africanization"  (or, at least, with "Afro-Cubanization") does
 
not apply only to Hispanic culture in New York City.
 It was
 
strongly apparent in Cuba in the l9L
I0's.
 There, a musician
 
i
-'
amed Arsenio xodri uez,  of Congolese descent,  created the
 
"modern" corijunto sound by adding a piano,  the conga drum
 
(previously only found in rumba drum orchestras), as well
 
T
v
larks  -

additional trumpets to the son ensemble.
 By including "breaks"
 
in his compositions, he gave room for the various percussion
 
instruments to be featured, and paved the way for the extensive
 
drum soloing typical of salsa.
 Every modern "Latin" orchestra
 
owes something to these Cuban con,iuntos
 of the forties and  '
ffties.
 
Popular Cuban music also featured a type of orchestra known
 
as the charanga, which included a flute, violins and timbales, 
tuneable drums played with sticks and derived from tympani drums.
 
The charanga ensemble descended from 19th
 century European
 
orchestras, but in the course of their development they,  too,
 
underwent an "Africanization" process.
 
By the  '
L
IO's,
 conga drums had been added, and the rhythmic
 
structure of the charanga repertoire  ,  closely associated with
 
a type of music called the danzôn, displayed the unmistakeable
 
stamp of West and Central African influence.
 (It might be
 
pointed out that charanga orchestras are extremely popular
 
in West Africa right now, and that many New York-based bands
 
of this type are household names in the urban centers of the
 
ivory Coast, Senegal, Mali and elsewhere.
 
The trumpet,  piano and percussion-based con,juntos and
 
the flute and violin charangas dominated Cuban music for many
 
years, and they often competed for popularity.
 In the mean-
time, a new form had arisen in New York City,  the mambo. This
 
is generally acknowledged to be the major Latin musical form
 
to be developed on the U.S. mainland, and it may be seen as
 
a wedding of the swing band of the  '
thirties with Afro-
Cuban rhythmic organization.
 The leading figure in its
 
development was Machi -t
o (Frank Grillo), a Cuban musician
 
V
Iarks
 
whose band even recorded with be-bop figures such as Charlie
 
Parker.
 
The mambo craze persisted well into the  '
fifties.
 Two
 
Puerto Rican band leaders were also popular at this  time,
 
Tito Puente and Tito Rodriguez.
 Until the Cuban revolution
 
and the subsequent breaking of diplomatic relations and blockade,
 
there was a free exchange between Cuban musicians and their
 
New York counterparts, many of whom were Cubanized New York-
born Puerto Ricans.
 Around 1960, Johnny Pacheco, a
 
Dominican-born percussionist and flautist, popularized the
 
oharanga sound in New York.
 By the mid--60's, he had switched
 
over to the conjunto sound.
 His group often played note-for--
note copies of Cuban arrangements,  sometimes based on those
 
played by Chapotin's band in Havana.
 
By this time,  the music had become immensely popular
 
with a young,  often New York-born Puerto Rican audience, who
 
were often totally unaware of the music's Cuban source.
 The
 
term "Latin" thus often meant "Cuban," and the typical salsa
 
band is a scaled-down mambo orchestra that plays a form of
 
the Cuban son-montuno with a mambo section tacked on at :he end
 
(this is comprised of call-and-response patterns between the
 
horns).
 This is  the format of the workshop and profession.
,
 
bands at the East Harlem Music School.
 Because of the ren-
popularity of the charanga sound in New York in recent years,
 
a workshop band in this style was also added.
 
It may safely be claimed that Cuban music has remained
 
0
 
a constant,  if sometimes unnamed,  source of New York's popular
 
"Latin" culture.
 With the cut-off of Cuba in the early  '
60's,
 
a new development appeared.
 This was the so-called bugal  
or boogaloo (in their Latin and Americanized spellings), and
 
this exactly the point where Johnny 0o16n enters Latin musical
 
history.
 
In the  '
3 0 '
s,  L
40's and
 0
's,  Latin musicians were of:en
 
adept at jazz,  so besides being bi-lingual,  they were bi-musical
 
as well.
 By the  '
sixties, a new generation of New York-born
 
Puerto Ricans was  exposed to urban black American rhythm-and-
blues  (which,  it might be added, had been influenced by Latin
 
music) .
 The result was a new "cross-over" form,  the bugal'I. 
It included horns and timbales, but also featured  "traps,"
 
the "American" drum set.
 Lyrics were often sung in English,
 
a rarity in other Latin musical forms, and  the hunal'  had
 
a definite street orientation.
 
While some have seen the bu ald as a corruption of Latin
 
music, Johnny 0016n considers it an important period of growth
 
for the music,  "an attempt to take it out of the Latin clubs
 
and give it more exposure"  (01,542).
 He also sees it as a
 
that served as an outlet for young Latin musicians to expres
 
themselves.
 Possibly because their lyrics were in English,
 
bugal s were played on radio stations that would not play
 
Latin music, and Johnny Col n's band was booked for  "white"
 
(non-Latin audiences).
 
The crowoh of a New Yoric-based sabsa,  often played by
 
young musicians barely into their twenties,  can really be dated
 
from the 1960's, as can the use of the te rm  "salsa" itself.
 
The word, which simply means  "sauce" in Spanish,  is not of-
fensive to Johnny Col n:  "The word made it easier for non-
Hispanics to accept.
 How many of them can pronounce guaguancô,
 
oa;ira or son montuno? 
'
Salsa'  is easier to say"  (Cl,  8
35).
 
Culture History and the East Harlem Music School
  
Although one of the stated  "missions" of the school is to
 
teach the history of the music, no such course exists at the
 
present.
 (Some were attempted but later abandoned.
 One of the
 
problems was that the instructor was monolingual in English.)
 
In my interviews with the instructors and in my informal dis-
cussions with students,  it was stressed over and over again
 
hat the main purpose of the school ist-o teach people to play
 
usic.

khile musicians from at least six Hispanic cultures now
 
participate in salsa (Puerto Ricans, Cubans, Dominicans,  Pana-
manians, Venezuelans, Colombians,  etc.),  Cuban musicians still
 
occupy a position of prestige within the music's hierarchy.
 
in his classes, Sonny Bravo does raise questions of origins,
 
both about the immediate Cuban sources of the music and the
 
African sources behind those.
 He says:  "Cuba is where most of
 
what
, we call  '
salsa'  developed.
 The term itself is a gimmick.
 
To Americans,  tangos and pasodobles are all  'Latin.'
 But sal
 
is Cuban.
 The guaguanc , son montuno, guaracha, bolero, cha c-
and gpa,jira are all Cuban forms.... You don't have to be Cuban
 
to perform or even to compose it.
 It's Cuban, but Puerto Ricans
 
Dominicans and even some Americans are involved"  (CLv -
6j).
 
Sonny Bravo's band has played and even recorded in Cuba
 
with musicians there, and has toured all over the Caribbean.
 
He thus has a broad perspective on the music, and is aware of
 
how two parallel versions of the same music have grown up in
 
Cuba and in New York.
 But he is also in a somewhat paradoxical
 
position in terms  of ethnic identity -
 he is a self-described
 
"
Cuban-American" who is playing a Cuban-derived music mostly
 
with New York-born Puerto Ricans.
 Whatever he knows about
 
the origins of the music becomes virtually irrelevant in the
 
teaching situation at the school.
 Thus, Cubans become  "Latins"
 
or "Hispanics," while Puerto Ricans and other "Hispanics" be-
come culturally Cubanized in the urban context.
 
The Spanish-speaking islands of the Caribbean all share a
 
common background of African-derived cultural forms,  so the

Afro-Cuban elements found within salsa were not totally foreign
 
to Puerto Ricans and Dominicans in New York.
 It involved
 
more of a re-orientation to the  "Afro" end of the spectrum
 
of their cultures.
 But recently salsa has been spreading
 
beyond Caribbean communities.
 I have recently learned,  for
 
example,  that young Chicanos in the southwest and in California
 
are listening to this music and not the the corridos of their
 
parents' and grandparents'  generation.
 Will a "chicano" salsa
 
arise, and will there be a subsequent regionalization of the
 
music?
 
I have evidence that points in this direction.
 It comes
 
not from the American southwest but from Colombia.
 In New York
 
City, a Cuban-born musician named Roberto Torres,  one of the
 
founders of the popular charanga group Orquesta Broadway,  is
 
now recording a regionalized charanga for Colombia.
 It is
 
known as the charanga vallenata, and in addition to  the usual
 
violins, flutes and rhythm,  it
 includes an acordeoi vallenato
  
a Colombian folk accordion.
 Thus, a regional version of the
 
"
creole" is now appearing, an urbanizing music  "imported"
 
from New York with a regional Colombian "accent."
 To show
 
the complexity and range of this phenomenon,  the notes to the
 
Roberto Torres'  album are written in Spanish and French, 
for the urban areas of francophone West Africa where this
 
music has a very large following.
 Therefore, New York (ity
 
may be seen as the center of an intricate web of musical
 
exchanges and influences.
 The East Harlem Music School is

Salsa and local politics
  
Despite these international implications,  the East Harlem
 
Music School is very much a neighborhood phenomenon.
 What
 
it teaches might be called "
salsa in a community con
tex
t
 
The early and continuing dependence on public agencies
 
deeply affected the school's entire history.
 
Johnny Col6n told me that his first attempt (in 1971)
 
to secure money from the New York City Youth Board was turned
 
down because the Board was dominated by Blacks at the time,
 
and they were reluctant to give funding to a project that wasn't
 
"
Black enough"  (Cl-58).
 (This was at a time when East Harlem
 
was 80-90% Hispanic).
 "65% of the funding of the Youth Board
 
was for Black services, with no Hispanic services," according
 
to Johnny Col6n (C1-66).
 
Until very recently,  the school was dependent on partial
 
support from the local school board as well -
 they contributed
 
38,000 a year to pay for the renting of teaching space in
 
public schools.
 Because of a personal difference with Johnny
 
i
arks  -19.
 
Colon, Mr.  1odri uez, now a City Councilman for East  arlem,
 
tried to evict the school from their quarters at P.S.  121.
 
The reason given was a budget deficit, but others saw this move
 
as a personal and political attack on Johnny ColOn himself.
 
(
Some say that it happened because ColOn had refused to allow
 
his school instructors play free  of charge for Rodrigue:'
 
political campaigns.
 
The school has been closely connected from its inception
 
with the public service sector.
 It should also be noted that
 
its present home in the old 23rd Precinct Building was funded
 
not by a grant for a music school,  let alone for an institute
 
of Hispanic culture.
 The Department of Employment of the City
 
of New York awarded Stephanie de Mui oz a grant for $300,000 to
 
fund a training program in clerical skills.
 (See 03,  34-104)
 
this was a strategy to acquire a permanent home and the  "admini-
:trative underpinnings" for the music school.
 Clerical skills
 
lasses were given by day, and music classes at night.
 La:er
 
rants from the New York State Council on the Arts and from
 
1e NEA and small foundations and corporations have allowed
 
the music classes  to expand to their present size.
 
Music, therapy and ethnic identity
  
In my conversations with Jonny ColOn  and Stephanie de Mu oz
 
they both stressed the therapeutic aspects of musical education,
 
and the rehabilitation of their students was seen as at least
 
as important as  "cultural maintenance."
 In founding the
 
school in 1972,  Johnny ColOn was  interested in

off the streets" during the drug epidemic that was ragina at
.-
that time.
 Both he and Stephanie gave many examples of students
 
who  were transformed by their studies at the school:  withdrawn
 
youngsters who learned to interact,  shell-shocked Viet Nam veterans,
 
and others.  He originally chose the evening hour classes, 7
-9
 
P
.M., because this  is when youna people hang out, and he wanted
 
to give them a place to go.
 
One of the most intersting examples of the rehabilitation
 
of ethnic identity was reported by Stephanie de Mu oz  (C
 -
 7
140-
7
65): "Jimmy Delgado came here when he was eleven -
 now he
 
teaches timbales at the school.
 He's a black Puerto Rican who
 
would tell people that he was Cuban.
 He thought that because
 
he was Puerto Rican, he couldn't be a good musician.
 Only
 
after coming to the school and talking to Johnny Colon and
 
the other instructors, he realized that it's OK to be Puerto
 
Rican.
 You don't have to be Cuban to be a good drummer.
 At
 
sixteen, he started playing with Ray Barreto and Larry Harlow.
 
At eighteen, he was back at the school as a teacher."
 
Folklore and politics
  
S
 
Because the school is still struggling to stay afloat, my
 
questions about the teaching of  "folklore" now seem somewhat
 
superfluous.
 While the workshop band's repertoire includes
 
bombas, these are not the drum-based folkloric type,  based
 
solely on percussion instruments.
 What they play is the
 
big-band "salsa" version of the bomba, whose rhythms are now
 
played on the conaa,  timbales and cowbell.
 Groups such as
 
:
larks  -21.
 
Victor Monta ez y sus Pleneros continue to play in the old
 
style in New York City, but theirs is a strictly  "folkloric"
 
style, not a "popular" one.
 
When I questioned Stephanie de Mu oz about the place of
 
folklore in the school,  she replied,  "We had a class  in the cuatro
  
(The ten-stringed guitar of rural Puerto Rico), but we only
 
had two students,  both of them in their fifties.
 There's
 
probably more interest in the instrument in Puerto Rico than
 
in New York.
 It's hard enough to sustain (popular)  culture
 
in a foreign environment than to sustain folkloric culture,  too.
 
Maintaining the fact of being Hispanic with a different language
 
and background is difficult enough"  (C3 -
 9J3 -9 8).
 
And when I aksed her if the maintenance of older folkloric
 
forms,  such as  ilbaro music, was politically motivated,  she said,
 
"Yes, and this is also true of American culture.
 Who wants to
 
play the dulcimer?
 Practically nobody.
 Most people are not
 
turned on by their heritage -
 it's like looking at the family
 
tree.
 It's mostly older people who want to maintain it (i.e.,
 
jbaro music,)
 (See C3, 948).
 
Because the different generations correspond so closely
 
to particular music styles taught at the school,  it is signi-
ficant that the person teaching the cuatro during the summer
 
of 1982 was born in 1955.
 Because the issue of politics is
 
a sensitive one,  I was reluctant to ask about the instructor's
 
(Elba Lugo) political orientation.
 
The younger generation in several Latin American countries,
 
often of middle-class backgrounds and leftist in their political
 
S
 
or enta icn, have created what has become known as
 he nueva
  
canci n or new song movement,  or as nueva trova in Cuba.
 
From the pe as of Allende's Chile to the Q
.uarteto Cedr n of
 
Buenos Aires (now in exile in France) and the group known as
 
Convite from the Dominican Republic,  the nueva canci n musicians
 
have revived old popular forms and have given regional varieties
 
a  new audience.
 They have also experimented with mixes of
 
styles and genres,  usually for overtly political reasons.
 
Thus,  for example,  the Puerto Rican nueva canciôn group
 
known as Haciendo Punto en Otro Son recorded a piece known as
 
the "seis Plenao,"  that is a ,
jIbaro seis played like a coastal
 
plena.
 The lyrics say that this mixture  "sounds better.
 
And Andr s Jimenez,
 known as  "El Jibaro," has recorded a
 
cantata dedicated to a "free" Puerto Rico that is virtually
 
a complete survey of traditional mountain forms.
 
It is therefore possible to speak of a continuum for the
 
,
jlbaro music of Puerto Rico.
 For independistas on the island
 
it represents cultural resistance, while not necessarily
 
rejecting the salsa that has come back from the mainland.
 
For Puerto Rican New Yorkers,  ,
1I aro
 music represents nostalgia
 
for the homeland when it is played in neighborhood social clubs,
 
or else its politicized version will be played in such venues
 
as the Taller Latinoamericano or La Tertulia in lower Man-
hattan.
 These places are far removed from the atmosphere
 
of the East Harlem Music School.
 
S
 
arks
 
Johnny Col n called the crowd that frequents La Tertulia
 
"Artsy,  classist and elitist"  (01-310).
 He also said that it
 
is young Puerto Rican professionals in New York who are going
 
for the folklore of Puerto Rico,  and even for the native Indian
 
music of the Andean countries of South America:
 This could
 
thus be seen as a middle-class manifestation of Hispanic
 
identity, as opposed to the more  "street"  -oriented Afro-Latin
 
music of salsa bands and drum orchestras.
 
The cuatro instructor fits this  "middle-class" profile  (she
 
has a Master's degree in psychology).
 She in fact told me
 
that the group that she regularly plays with consists of  "three
 
South Americans,  from Chile and Peru, and two Puerto Ricans."
 
(
05-12)
 They play a "Latin American" music, but it is based
 
on the native music of Andean Indians.
 In the context of the
 
East Harlem Music School, however, Elba Lugo is restricted to
 
teaching the cuatro to three middle-aged Puerto Rican women.
 
(Compare this number to the ninety teen-agers who registered
 
for the conga drum classes one summer in the late  '
seventies.)
 
But the cuatro does appear in the salsa workshop band,
 
where it is played by Carlos Sab ter, a PuertoRican New Yorker
 
in his twenties.
 He plays it with an electric pick-up, and
 
this amplified cuatro has taken the place of the Cuban tres  
that played in the old conjuntos. 
This practice is in keeping
 
with the  "creolizing" function of salsa -
 the same ensemble
 
that features Sonny Bravo's  "Cuban" piano can have the  "Puerto
 
Rican" cuatro, as well as the  "New York"  trombones,  saxophones
 
and trumpets.

The workshop band also has  two students from Colombia.
 
Because salsa had
, already been exported to their country of
 
birth prior to their migration to New York,  they were already
 
familiar with it.
 They were thus able to walk into a salsa
 
band that had already been "creolized."  A significant number
 
of Colombian immigrants could conceivably add another regional
 
"accent" to this creole.
 
Salsa, Role Models and the East Harlem Music School
  
Given the important role of music in the maintenance c
 
an Hispanic identity,  it is obvious that musicians are imperta:
 
role-models for the many younger students,  especially males,
 
who attend the school.
 In a statement made by Frar
ikie Malab ,
 
a former instructor at the school, he says:  "I used to watch
 
the older guys  jam on 112th Street and Madison Avenue.
 While
 
the protestants were busy preaching and singing their hymns,
 
they would be on the other corner,  playing their instruments.
 
And I
'd be dead center,  steadily watching the conga player.
 
Then whenever I would ask them to teach me they would always
 
tell me the same thing,
 Beat it, kid. '
 I remember how hur
 
I would get whenever they said that. .
.
 .These kids  (at the S
 
Harlem Music School) are not only talented and intelligent,
 
they are also very lucky. .
 .
 .
 They can learn without having
 
to worry about things like not being able to afford it.
 I
 
wish in those days I had had a chance like these children.
 
Instead,  I had to learn from the older guys in the neighbor-
hood, who were reluctant to teach a kid"(  from statement included
 
as Appendix 1 )
.
 
Marks -25.
 
For many Hispanic males,  "
jamming" in the street is an important
 
part of their culture and male identity.
 This is why so many
 
of the students at the school are self-enrolled teenaged males.
 
As Sonny Bravo said,  "If they're any younger than that,  they
 
were dragged in by their parents"  (
CL
i-798).  He in fact said
 
that their interest in drumming coincides with puberty (805).
 
Stephanie de Mu oz echoed this idea:  "At ten or eleven,  Latin
 
kids want rock and disco.
 But in their teens,  they want Latin
 
'
I need to find out about who I am and what my music really is'
 
so there's a 100% turn-around"  (03-U57).
 
It is also significant that in the school's professional
 
band,  the percussion section is made up in its entirety of
 
students, while the horn section is not.
 There is thus an
 
incentive to rise through the classes and workshop band to
 
the professional orchestra, which sometimes plays on the same
 
program with such well-established bands as Tito Puente
 
and the orquesta Broadway (see Appendix 2).
 
Conclusions
  
To speak of salsa as a "creOlized" form carries with it
 
the implication that this music is now the  "first language"
 
of its players.
 This is precisely the case with second and
 
third generations of Puerto Ricans born in New York City.
 
As far as they are concerned,  this is "their" music.
 Older
 
forms have moved to the left of the political spectrum and
 
have become ideological metaphors.
 Cuban music, and now
 
even Cuban ayoruba ritual drumming,  continues to fuel develop-
S
 
Marks  -26
 
ments in New York salsa.
 The most traditional music from 7he
 
"Afro" end of the Cuban stylistic continuum thus moves moo
 
the avant-garde.
 A good example would be the Fort Apache
 
Band, which includes several ex-instructors at the East Harlem
 
Music School.
 They play everything from Yoruba ritual music
 
to be-bop.
 
The quesciom of Hispanic  identioy is bound up w'
-,h ohe
 
contextualized meaning of musical styles, much as any social
 
or ethnic identity is expressed through symbolic systems.
 
But social scientists have primarily looked at language
 
as the carrier of social meanings:  "The key point of our
 
argument in this book is that social identity and ethnic-47y
 
are in large part established and maintained through langua
.
 
Yet it is because of the historical character of the proce
 
through which groups are formed and the symbols of identit
 
created that we have the particular characteristics of the
 
ways of speaking that we will be analyzing.
 This argument
 
therefore serves to attenuate the explanatory relationship
 
between language,  ideology and speaking practices.
 Only
 
by understanding the specific historical roots of language
 
divergence can we adequately account for the specific
 
character of the communicative practices and monitor ongoing
 
processes of social change (
 from Language and Social Identity, 
ed. by John Gumperz,  Cambridge University Press, NY,  1982,pp.7-8).
 
If we substitute  "music" for  "language" and  "playing"
 
for "speaking," we can see that another cultural system
 
besides language can reflect the dynamics of culture change
 
and become significant badges of social identity.
