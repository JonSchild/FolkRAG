T

profession. 
Written and sung by BEN DODGE. 
While out in the country last Summer I 
wedded 
A 
blushing young damsel whom I 
thought sublimo, 
immediately alter we moved to the city, 
Where we have lived happy the most of the time; 
Until last Friday night my homestead I 
entered, 
.1 saw there a 
young man, nineteen if a 
day, 
And as I 
gazed at him, completely bewildered, 
The wife of my bosom unto me did say— 
Don't take any notice, it's only my cousin. 
Don't let a 
small matter like this one annoy: 
Now don't get excited, it's only my cousin. 
You mustn't mind Willie—he's only a 
boy. 
My wife with her cousin was very much smitten, 
At least so it seemed by her actions that night. 
For she called him " Dear Willie" in tones very tender, 
Now I 
ask any married man if it was right : 
When the clock on the mantel struck the hour of eleven, 
She kissed him good- night ere he went to his bed, 
sprang to my feet in a 
horrible passion, 
But my wife stopped my growling, and quietly said— 
Don't take any notice. etc. 
Next evening as I 
was from labor returning, 
A 
friend told me something which addled my brain. 
My wife and her cousin had " sloped" from the city, 
He'd seen them buy tickets and leave on the train: 
ru.-died to the house, at the door met the servant, 
The truth of the statement I 
tend in her face, 
My wife had shook mu for her dear cousin Willie, 
She'd left her fond husband to live in disgrace. 
-3-POREN.—After my friend had given me the unwelcomo ii-
1 
I 
rushed frantically home. 
The door was lockssl: 
one tremendous kick I 
burst it open. 
The servant :.tirt 
met me in the hall and said, " Good Heavens, l 
r. Dodge! w!;. 
is the matter?" 
I 
asked for my wife ; she told me the inalc:i 
had only gone out for a 
short walk. ( Even the servants wci-
conspiring against me.) 
I 
litned up stairs to our bedeliambei.. 
There upon the dressing ease lay a 
note addressed to me. 
I 
quickly picked it up, tore it open, and there. plainly written I 
read— 
JOCKEY CLUB BOUQUET. 
Words by I:tint:ET 1VoitnEs, of AV onnEx A;

(inc evening in July, 
When the sunset gilt the sky, 
And the little birds were warbling ' mid the trees; 
I 
met a 
maiden fair, 
With wavy golden hair, 
Who seemed to lend it perfume to the breeze. 
tier eyes of dreamy blue, 
l 
ler cheeks of brilliant hue. 
And a 
merry song she warbles all the (lay ; 
Her name she would not tell. 
And as I 
loved her well, 
I 
christened her my Jockey Club Bouquet.

It's true I'm deep in love, (break) 
I'll win the girl, by Jove, (break) 
For she's promised to be mine, 
Before the Winter tune, 
And don't I 
wish to see the wedding. day; 
For her name she will not tell, 
And as I 
love her well, 
I've christened her my .Jockey Club Bouquet. 
(Dance.' 
She is as gentle as a 
dove. 
And bashful as her love, 
And says that .I'm an impudent young man; 
And when I 
ask a 
kiss 
From this charming little miss, 
She tries to lade her face behind her fan. 
But if my wooing thrives, 
And the wedding day arrives, 
And to the church with me she'll gaily trip away; 
Why, if the fun you'd view, 
I'll introduce to you— 
My charrning little Jockey Club Bouquet.

MY EMMA JANE. 
Written and sung by By DODGE. 
I 
really think there is no use, 
Of trying to feel gay. 
I'm getting thinner, t 
believe, 
And fading every day; 
It's just because the girl I 
love 
Has been unkind to me, 
She's left my side away to roam, 
Far o'er the raging sea. 
Cnoncs. 
My Emma Jane, my Emma Jane, 
She's gone, and I'm sure I'll ne'er see her again, 
She's gone far from me, ' way over the sea, 
Cruel and unkind Emma Jane. 
My charmer was a 
fine girl 
As you would wish to see, 
I 
loved her very fondly and 
I 
thought that she loved me; 
But it did not take me very long 
To find out my mistake, 
For she eloped with a 
dry goods clerk, 
And gave poor me the shake. 
My Emma Jane, etc. 
I 
squandered all my hard-earned cash, 
And not a 
murmur made, 
And that I 
did quite silly act, 
I 
sadly am afraid; 
But it didn't do a 
bit of good, 
With me she would not stay, 
She took all of my presents and 
With the clerk she skipped away. 
My Emma .Jane, etc. 
uUR STAR SPANGLED FLAG OF TaB 
FREE,. 
Written and sung by BEN DonoE. 
sing you a 
song of our glorious tlag, 
The emblem of sweet liberty, 
The pride of each true-born American heart, 
Our star spangled flag of the free, 
'fis loved and respected wherever on earth 
Its bright folds in glory may wave, 
For it speaks of Columbia, the land of the free, 
And the home of the true and the brave. 
Otiours. 
Then three rousing cheers for our glorious flag, 
The emblem of sweet liberty; 
'Tis the pride of each true-born American heart, 
Our star spangled flag of the free. 
Tis but one hundred years since our grandsires of old, 
Declared that their sons should be free, 
And no longer ruled with tyrannical power, 
By England's king over the sea; 
They assembled in Congress on the Fourth of July, 
And each pledged his life to be true 
'Till the day of his death to his country and friends, 
And our banner, the Red, White and Blue. 
Then three rousing cheers, etc. 
Each patriot's heart with true joy overflowed. 
When the " old bell " in tones loud and clear, 
Proclaimed to the world that a 
nation was born, 
Which to freemen would ever be dear; 
A 
great shout of gladness leaped forth from each lip, 
When ' twas first learned the deed had been done, 
For they felt that the God of all battles would bless 
The colors of our Washington. 
Then three rousing cheers, etc. 
The nation our forefathers gave us that day, 
Is acknowledged the best now on earth, 
And the poor emigrant oft with tears iii his eyes, 
NVill bless the proud day of its birth; 
For he finds in America a 
land free to all, 
A home free from tyranny's bars, 
Where the poor and oppressed are protected at last, 
'Neath the folds of the dear stripes and stars. 
Then three rousing cheers, etc. 
THE FLAGS WE LOVE TO SEE. 
Written and 511ri,.7 by BEN DODGE. 
My favorite song I'm going to sing, 
A 
plain One, ' r5 hale. d, 
I'll do my best to please yon all, 
And trust I 
will Hicceed ; 
The kind applause I 
hope to gain 
Of each before I 
go, 
The banners that 
on love the best. 
To you I 
now Will show. 
I 
cannot speak of all the lands 
On which the sun's rays fall, 
But merely those I 
claim to be 
The greatest of them all ; 
I've chosen six to form t:le song. 
Which to you now I brim!. 
I 
trust you will attention give. 
And liFlten while I 
sing. 
The British colors are the first, 
Which to you I 
will show, 
You'll find the subjects of John Bull 
Where er you May go ; 
In the homes of their adoption, 
• 
They're as happy as can be, 
But still their hearts \tin ever turn 
To the land beyond the sea. 
The banner of old England 
Is known throughout the world, 
O'er every land and every sea, 
Its folds have been unfurled : 
Her soldiers always ready are, 
Its honor to defend, 
And every nation of the earth 
Is proud to be her frien,t. 
The Gerrsans of their flag, are proud, 
Their country and their king, 
It would not do to pass them by, 
So of them I 
will sing; 
With all the world they're now at peaee, 
A 
bright and prosperous land, 
Their people all, both rich and poor. 
United heart and hand. 
O'er all that happy country, 
Prosperity's sun cloth shine, 
From the swiftly flowing Elba, 
To the broad and peaceful Rhine; 
Their banner dear, of colors three, 
I 
now will show to you, 
No matter where a 
German is, 
He to this flag is true. 
There's a 
mighty land across the sea, 
Which to you I 
will name, 
Its ruler by his actions has 
Secured a 
world-wide fame ; 
in defence of Christian priticiples, 
He's now engaged in war, 
And every friend of right and truth 
Upholds the Russian Czar. 
With us on kindly terms he's been, 
And always proved a 
friend, , 
And should we chance to need his aid, 
On him we can depend: 
Let's trust the Turks may soon be forced 
His power to confess, 
And the standard which I 
show you now 
Be crowned with true success. 
Of all the banners of the earth. 
Which ever have been seen, 
There's none so dear to Irish hearts, 
As Erin's flag of green; 
Its praises often have been sung, 
In happy this otore, 
fly the minstrel bard of olden time— 
The poet, Thomas Aloore. 
To " Sunburst of obi Ire and " 
Is sacred, pure anti dear, 
To every true born Irishman, 
WIlo's earnest and sincere; 
'1'is suffering from oppression now, 
But ( please God) we'll yet see, 
This banner floating in the breeze, 
Br4;ht, beautiful and free, 
12 
While struggling for our liberty, 
One hundred years ago. 
Against a 
tyrant's power we had 
Assistance as you know: 
A 
noble son of " sunny France," 
His fortune freely gave, 
And with our sires he bravely fought, 
This glorious land to save. 
Unsought he volunteered his aid, 
And we never can forget 
The one to whom we owe so much— 
The generous Lafayette; 
And as a 
tribute to his came, 
I 
now will show with pride, 
The flag he wished with ours to wave, 
Together side by side. 
And last I've got a 
glorious flag, 
'Tis known o'er land and sea, 
The pride of honest Yankee hearts— 
The banner of the free : 
r,, ,,;pocted now where'er it waves. 
And loved by every one, 
Tie colors of a 
hero hold--
The immortal Washington. 
Tnousands of our countrymen 
So noble true and brave. 
Hive perished on the battle.field, 
Its honor pure to save; 
It's glory never has been dimmed, 
By many bitter wars, 
the emblem of sweet Liberty— 
Our own dear stripes and stars.

THAT'S WHEN YOU WILL KNOW WHO'S 
YOUR FRIEND, 
Written and sung by BEN DODGE. 
To my true friend, W ILL IL 7.11ouToN• 
It's all very foolish to boast of your friends, 
And imagine them faithful and true, 
In the hour of misfcrtune you surely will find 
There's no one with friendship for you.
 ; 
Your child may be starving and crying for bread, 
No one has a 
penny to lend, 
To help drive the dread wolf away from your door— 
That's when you will know who's your friend. 
Then take my advice—it is said for your good— 
Bear in mind I 
don't wish to offend ; 
Being saving of cash, and keep plenty on hand, 
And you never will want for a 
friend. 
While jogging along through the journey of life. 
You are sure to meet sorrow and care, 
But fight boldly onward through thick and through thin, 
And never give up in despair; 
Be honest and upright whatever you do, 
Your honor at all times defend— 
All men will look up to you then with respect, 
And be proud to be known as your friend. 
Then take my advice, etc. 
One evening being at a 
loss for something else to do, 
I 
strolled into a 
concert hall to see what there was new, 
The moment I 
had stepped inside I 
was bewildered quite, 
For, oh! a 
vision met my gaze which filled me with de-
light; 
A 
girl was tripping round the stage to music by the band, 
I 
thought that I 
had never seen a 
sight one half so grand, 
Her movements were so graceful ad her dancing so sub-
lime, 
'Twas madamoiselle, the principal belle, the pet of the Pan-
tomime. 
Cuont:s. 
For she was all the rage, as she tripped around the stage, 
Her singing and her dancing were divine ; 
Admired by all the press, for she was far the best, 
Was madamoiselle, the principal belle, the pet of the 
Pantomime. 
The dance was done, she tripped away, the crowd all yelled 
encore, 
I 
clapped my hands end stamped my feet until they both 
were sore, 
But what cared I 
for that, my boys, I 
did not mind the 
pain, 
I 
only wished to get a 
sight at her sweet face again ; 
My efforts were rewarded, for she came back with a 
smile, 
I 
never saw such winning ways, or half as charming style, 
I 
fancied her an angel sweet from the skies above, 
For with her I 
declare I 
fell head over heels in love. 
For she was, etc. 
I 
sent my card and asked if I 
on her some day might call, 
She answered " Yes, but come alone, or do not come at 
all," 
My gook luck I 
could scarce believe, I 
knew not what to 
say, 
For so completely a 
surprise quite took my breath away; 
Next day I 
called, but oh ! I 
met her husband at the door, 
lie kicked 1132. down the stairs and then beat me till I 
was 
sore, 
And then he gave me this advice, " Look out, young man, 
next time, 
Don't try to ' mash ' the Pantaloon's wife. the pet of the 
Pantomime." 
For she was, etc 
16 
17 
For some time I 
have sojourned in this city, 
And of course I 
have been looking out for fun, 
I've desired with the girls to get acquainted, 
But they " turn me the cold shoulder "—every one 
There is one by whom I 
have been captivated. 
And though to gain her notice I 
did seek, 
She somehow frowned on all of my advances, 
Till I 
showed the little " Tommy with a 
squeak !" 
SPOKEN.—That " 
broke the ice," for ;he turned around 
with an angelic smile and murmured— 
Pretty little Tommy. etc. 
PRETTY LITTLE TOMMY, 
Written and sung by BEN DODGE. 
One afternoon as down the street I 
rambled, 
My attention was attracted by a 
crowd 
Of people, who with open mouths were list'ning 
To some language, which to me seemed very loud; 
It issued from a 
chap upon the corner. 
A 
fellow who was overstocked with cheek. 
He'd a 
little rubber toy which he was selling, 
And he said it was a " Tommy with a 
squeak." 
SPOKEN.—He pulled a 
string, causing the little rubber 
toy to move its arms and legs in a 
ridiculous manner, and 
at the same time to utter a 
very peculiar little squeak; then 
the gentleman would turn round to his audience and say— 
t ' twat's. 
Will you buy a 
little Tommy with a 
squeak, squeak, 
squeak, 
Pull it for a 
week it will squeak, squeak, squeak ; 
Buy a 
little Tommy with a 
squeak, squeak, squeak, 
Pretty little Tommy with a 
squeak. 
I 
purchased one, it was so very funny 
That I 
couldn't keep it hidden out of sight, 
At home we had a 
little boy in trowsers, 
Who had suffering been, and crying all the night; 
And the cause, I 
found, of all his youthful sorrow 
Was, he'd had the stomach-ache for near a 
week, 
But he laughed so loud, the pain at once departed. 
When I 
let him take the 
Tommy with a 
squeak." 
Will you buy, etc, 
_ 
Now advice in this matter I 
will give you, 
And I'm certain you will find it true indeed. 
If you try, and cannot win a 
girl's affections, 
Buy a 
little rubber toy, and you'll succeed ; 
For if when to plead your cause you would endeavor, 
Should the lady blush and hang her head so meek, 
She'll quickly smile and whisper yes so sweetly, 
When you show the little " Tommy with a 
squeak!" 
Will you buy, etc., 
EATING PEANUTS. 
Written and sung by BEN DOME. 
One day while strolling down the street, I 
met a 
lady fair, 
With ruby lips and rosy cheeks, and curly golden hair; 
She was standing in a 
candy store and smiled as I 
passed 
by, 
I 
bowed, and then she winked at me with her bright blue 
laughing eye.. 
SPOKEN. —I, 
of course, entered the store and commenced 
a 
conversation with the young lady. .1 
asked her how she 
managed to pass away her time, and her reply was this : 
" 
Part of my time I 
pass away in waiting on customers, 
and in dressing and sleeping; but the most of my time I 
pass in— 
Eating peanuts, eating peanuts. 
And oranges too, and of gum drops a 
few; 
And bananas, good bananas, 
That's how I 
pass off all my time. 
We stood and for about an hour had a 
most pleasant talk, 
I 
asked her if next evening she with me would take a 
walk; 
She said %would please her very much, but still I 
felt quite 
sad, 
To find she'd not give her consent until I 
asked her dad. 
"Nixy weeden, I 
won't have it. 
Don't shoot off year chin, for your racket's too 
thin; 
Cheese it Cully, take a 
tumble, 
Sherry your nibs and get out." 
The fair one vowed she loved me dear, and to me she'd be 
true, 
But passing there next day I 
saw what made me feel quite 
blue ; 
19 
Near the window by her side there sat a 
chap I'd often 
met, 
He kissed her right before my face— it made me mad, you 
bet. 
Srokkx.—It's enough to make any one mad. I 
said to 
her, " Evelina, is it with your consent that he embraces 
you thusly ?" and she replied, " Veit, verily ." Toth she 
kisz.ed him right before Inv face. Then I 
raved and swore; 
I 
heaped every invective I 
could possibly think of upon their 
devoied heads. 
Pretty s,)oa I 
heard something (II 
op, and 
on looking up I 
saw they were moving the furniture out 
of the house—in fact, they were heaving it out of the win-
dow at me, and there hit me on the top of the head— 
A bootjack and a 
fiat-iron, 
And a 
Oa 
,ade for beer hit me right in the ear; 
A 
big dippet 
a 
skillet, 
Stretched me out my full length on the ground. 
I 
quickly sprang upon my feet and rushed far from the 
place, 
And cursed the day when first I 
gazed on that deceitful 
face; 
They've since been married, and I've learned a 
large family 
they have got, 
But since the day that I 
was " sold " I've not been near 
the spot. 
SPONEN.—No, I 
don't go there any more, but a 
friend of 
mine was down to their place the oth r 
day ,, 
and he in-

When the old 
man died he left them to carry on the buine,s at the same 
old stand, and he also says that from Alpha t,) the Omega of 
that entire family, they pass their time from morning to 
night in— 
Eating peanuts, eating peanuts, 
And oranges too, and of gum drops a 
few; 
And bananas, good bananas, 
' 
That's bow they pasq off all their time.

THEY SAID I 
COULDN'T DO IT, BUT I 
DID. 
Written and sung by BEN DODGE. 
When I 
was but a 
little boy, and toddled ol to school, 
The people one and all declared that I'd grow up a 
fool, 
Their sneers and jeers would greet me whichever way I'd turn, 
Because they said good common sense I 
surely ne'er would 
learn; 
But they were not so much to blame, for ' twixt both you and me, 
It nearly took me a 
whole year to learn my A, B, C, 
But I 
succeeded, and at last of their abuse got rid, 
'They said ' twas what I 
could not do, but they now confess I 
did. 
Ctiouus. 
Oh 1 
they said I 
couldn't do it but I 
did, 
They said I 
couldn't do it, but I 
did: 
They vowed I'd be a 
fool, 'cause I 
couldn't learn at school, 
They said I 
couldn't do it, but I 
did. 
'As year by year I 
older grew, of couse I 
fell in love, 
Twas with a 
bright and charming girl, fair as the skies above, 
But something very strange, and which I 
could not understand', 
I -ne'er could muster courage up to ask her for her hand ; 
I 
called each night, of course, to tell the oft-repeated tale, 
But when the question tried to pop, ;! y 
nerve would somehow 
fail, 
My friends laughed at me, till one day, with pleasure I 
confess, 
The words slipped out " Will you be mine?" and my darling 
answered " Yes," 
CHORUS. 
Oh! they said I 
Qouldn't do it, but I 
did, 
They said I 
couldn't do it, out I 
did; 
Now everybody knows, A's a 
hard job to propose, 
They said I 
couldn't do it, but did. 
My wife and I 
have married been for full three years or more, 
No children have we raised, and I 
felt tender on that score, 
For every day some friend of mine in joking tones would sneer, 
And say 'twas his opinion that the case w.,s rather queer 
it's bothered me much more, my friends, than I 
care to reveal, 
But at last it has come out all right, and awful proud I 
feel, 
Each friend I 
meet upon the street to wish me joy begins, 
For to-day my wife presented me with a 
bouncing pair of twins. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! they said we couldn't do it, but we did, 
They said we couldn't do it but we did; 
Now we've got a 
girl and boy, who cause us the greatest 
joy,

IT'S EASY ENOUGH WHEN YOU LEARN 
HOW. 
Did you ever consider some time when you've tried 
To accomplish some purpose or aim, 
Vitli which unfamiliar you happen to be, 
That it oft proves a 
difficult game; 
But it's useless to grumble or growl at your lot, 
Or let ill temper ruffle your brow, 
Keep on with good courage, you'll surely Succeed_. 
It's easy enough when you learn how. 
Cuoncs. 
If you cannot accomplish the object in view, 
There's no use in raising a 
row, 
' 
Though at first unsuccessful, you surely will find 
It's easy enough when you learn how. 
If with some charming girl you are deeply in love, 
And her hand you are trying to win, 
Volt are anxious your feelings for her to disclose, 
But you scarcely know how to begin; 
You stammer and mumble, grow re i 
in the face, 
While your love you are trying to vow, 
'Till at last it slips out and the question you pop— 
easy enough when you learn how. 
if you cannot, etc. 
Now although we've been married for several years, 
My %via) disco:itented has grown, 
'To think while our neighbors with children : tr-,; blest, 
We have none we can cl.iirn for cur own ; 
I 
should feel wry sad if I 
t!Fiught throughout life, 
It would always be as it is now,

IT'S NICE. 
Written expressly for!LITTLE BOB, by BEN DODGE. 
Some time ago I 
loved a 
girl, 
And very strange to say, 
Although she claimed to worship me, 
She'd a 
peculiar way 
Of acting very shy and strange, 
Whenever I 
was nigh, 
And when I 
asked the reason then, 
To me she would reply--
CHORUS. 
It's nice, it's nice, 
Don't you think it is so? 
It's nice, it's nice, 
Now that's what I 
exclaim; 
It's nice, it's nice, 
Don't you think it is so ? 
Most everybody says it is, 
Of course I 
think the same. 
We're married now, and happy live 
As two doves in a 
nest, 
And with a 
charming family 
Our union has been blest ; 
We've got a 
pair of bouncing twins— 
A 
lovely girl and boy, 
And the pleasures of our married life 
There's nothing can annoy. 
Now there's my next door neighbor, who 
Es known as Deacon Brown, 
Supposed by every one to be 
The straightest man in town: 
But I 
caught him late last Sunday night, 
Doing something wrong I'm sure, 
lie was trying to kiss his servant girl 
Behind the pantry door. 
SPOKEN.—I said, " Here, here, 
Deacon, stop! 
That's 
naughty." 
But he only said, " I 
know it is, Bobby, but--
, 
It's nice." etc. 
I'm dreaming of old Ireland, 
The fairest spot on earth. 
The home of heroes true and brave, 
The dear land of my birth. 
Where'er I 
roam I 
think of home, 
And friends so dear to me, 
I 
can't forget old Ireland and 
The one I 
long to see, 
I 
can't forget old Ireland and 
My own sweet Gra Machree. 
CHORM 
Then good bye, Norah darling, 
I'm going far away; 
It breaks my heart to leave you, love, 
And sail for America. 
But soon I 
will come back again, 
I'm happy as can be, 
While thinking of the blissful time, 
When Norah I 
shall see; 
Sure then our sorrows will be o'er, 
From her I 
ne'er wi I 
part, 
But closely cling to old Ireland and 
The darling of my heart, 
But closely cling to old Ireland and 
The dear one of my heart. 
Then good bye, etc. 
THE PULL-BACK DRESS. 
I'll sing to you a 
song about the fashions now-a- days, 
The people all are dressing in such very curious ways, 
, The girls, especially, who have lost all common sense, I 
guess 
The way they sling themselves around in the late style pull-
back dress. 
CTIORE'S. 
They wear the pull-back dress, the late style pull-back dress, 
They pull them back and pin them fast to make their skirts 
look less; 
Oh! that's the pull-back dress, the famous pull-dress, 
Dame Fashion sure was on a 
drunk when she planned the 
pull- back dress. 
You'll meet a 
stunning looking girl while walking down the 
street, 
All pinned back in her crinoline, the style she thinks so sweet, 
But if she was to tell the truth she surely would confess, 
She's afraid to sit for fear she'll burst the pucker-string of her 
dress. 
They wear, etc. 
While out to-day I 
met a 
girl dressed in the latest style, 
A 
little mishap that she met provoked from me a 
smile, 
She stepped upon an orange peel, it caused an awful mess, 
Her heels flew up, her head came down, that settled that pull-
back dress, 
They wear, etc, 
THE KIND LOVING FACES AT HOME, 
I'm thinking to- day of the home of my youth. 
Near the brooklet that runs through the glade, 
The :2yeen grassy lawn and the orchard so dear, 
Where oft in my childhood I've strayed : 
'I'is many a 
year since those scenes I 
have left, 
Through far-distant countries to roam, 
i3ut where'er I've wandered l've still longed to see 
The kind loving faces at home. 
And though we are parted, yet ever to me 
,Sweet thoughts of my loved ones will come ; 
And where'er I 
wander I 
still long to see 
The kind loving faces at home. 
How oft in my dreams have my thoughts wandered back 
To my mother, so kind and so true, 
Who whispered " Good by and God bless you, my boy," 
When I 
bid her and father adieu; 
E'en now in my fancy I 
once more can feel 
Her warm, loving kiss on my brow, 
And sigh when I 
think that ' tis naught but a 
dream, 
For I'm wandering far from her now. 
And though, etc. 
My sweet loving sister, with whom I 
have played 
So oft in our childhood at home, 
Has sent to me many a 
message of love, 
To cheer me wherever I 
roam; 
My father is waiting to greet me again, 
When my long weary journey is o'er, 
And soon we will meet round the old fireside, 
To part until death, never more, 
Written and sung by BEN BODGE. 
Curiosities are all the rage with people now-a- days, 
A museum full of them I've got, and find quite well it pays, 
The funny things which I've secured will please you all, I 
know, 
I've just come back with them, my friends, from the great 
Centennial show 
I've got " the whale that Jonah swallowed," " The fellow 
who couldn't get fat," 
Boss Tweed, the man with the educated thumb, and Gree-
ley's old white hat, 
I've got a 
horn from " Sitting Bull," and have lately come 
across 
The girl with the wart on her elbow, and the original 
Charley Ross. 
I've got an honest Congressman politicians cannot buy, 
And a 
chap who vows with a 
i1ver spoon he can straighten 
Ben Butler's eye ; 
I've got a 
creature who thinks old Beecher is free from 
earthly sins, 
But the funniest thing which I 
have got is a 
pair of " old 
maid's twins. 
Written and sung by BEN DODGE. 
I 
daily am growing depressed and disheartened, 
My griefs and my troubles to you I'll relate; 
Dame Fortune upon me is certainly frowning, 
The cause of my sadness is my cruel fate. 
The whole of my life is o'ercast with a 
shadow, 
For all kinds of pleasure I 
don't care a 
straw;. 
It's sirapfy because, like a 
fool, T 
got marr!ed, 
And I've got a 
bad case of a " mother-iu-law." 
She comes twice every year to pay us a 
visit, 
And not stretching the truth the least mite, I 
can swear 
That each visit is fully of six months duration, 
And her presence completely fills me with despair. 
When she enters the house then my trouble commences, 
For the whole livelong day she does nothing but jaw; 
How often I've envied oar first father—Adain— 
For he wasn't cursed with a 
mother-in-law. 
Our servant girl, Sarah, is fresh from the country, 
An exceedingly good-natured and pretty young miss, 
One evening, while hugging her down in the kitchen, 
I 
thought I'd endeavor to steal a 
sly kiss. 
Said Sarah, " Your wife would most surely be jealous, 
If she could but see us;" I 
answered, " Oh, shawl" 
When the door was burst open, and there stood befork us 
That horrid old monster, my mot!wr-in-law. 
The girl was discharged then and I 
soundly rated. 
For I 
couldn't lie out of the matter, of course, 
And my mother-in-law's tongue is constantly running, 
So my wife firmly vows site will have a 
divorce. 
Now 
our "Crack Rifle Team" does some mighty fine shooting, 
The result of each match is alwaygf a 
draw; 
I'll give any good marksman seven doHars and a 
half 
To take a 
few shots at my mother-in-law, 
THE SPADE. 
As originally sung ny GRIEF Bowery, 
GIVE me the Spade and the man who can use it: 
A 
fig for your lord, and his soft silken hands, 
Let the man who has strength never stoop to abuse it, 
Give back to the giver—the land, boys, the land. 
There's no bank like the Earth to deposit your labor, 
The more you deposit the more you shall have; 
If there's more than you want you can give to your neighbor; 
And your name shall be dear to the true and the brave. 
CHOEUS.--Give me the spade, ice. 
Wye me the spade—the American's glory— 
That fashions the field from the bleak barren moor, 
Let us speak cf its praise in ballad and story, 
While ' tis brightened with labor, not tarnished with gore. 
It was not the Sword that won our best battles, 
Created our Commerce, extended our Trade, 
Gave food for our wives, our children, our cattle, 
But the queen of all weapons—the Spade, boys, the Spade. 
Give me the spade, 34c. 
Give me the Spade, there's a 
magic about it, 
That turns the black soil into bright shining gold, 
*hat would our fathers have done, boys, without, 
When this land lay all bare and the north wind blew cold. 
Where the tall forests stood, and the wild beasts were yelling, 
Where our stout-hearted ancestors shrank back afraid— 
Now the cornstack is raised and have cleared a 
dwelling, 
Then Hurrah for our true friend, the Spade, boys, the Spade., 
Give me the spade, etc. 
A story true I'll tell to you, 
Of the troubles of my life: 
Though in love I've been—like many other men— 
I 
never could get. a 
wife. 
For the girls are so shy, (but I 
can't tell why). 
And sad it is to relate ; 
Though I've tried and tried, till I've almost died, 
Still I 
cannot find a 
mate. 
CHORUS. 
There's the monkey and the dog. the turtle and the frog. 
The fishes that swim in the sea; 
And the pretty little squirrel, with his tail up in a 
curl, 
Oh, they've all got a 
wife but me. 
When first in love, head o'er heels I 
dove, 
It was with a 
girl named Lize; 
She'd a 
nose hard to beat, she'd number ten feet, 
And a 
pair of codfish eyes. 
I 
offered my hand, in a 
style quite grand, 
And what do you s'upoose ? 
She said very cool that she wasn't such a 
fool, 
And she turned up her pretty little nose. 
SPOREN.—It made me outrageously mad to think that she 
went back on me after I'd squandered all my wealth upon her— 
not that I 
cared for the money, but I 
hated to realize that— 
Cuoitus. 
There's the chicken and the cat, the weasel and the rat, 
The skeeter and the bumble bee; 
The cunning little lizard and the naughty old buzzard, 
Oh, they've all got a 
wife but me. 
XIy love number two, was a 
girl named Sue, 
Who clerked in a 
dollar store; 
Each day I 
dressed in all my best, 
And wandered past the door. 
I 
wrote her a 
letter—(oh, I 
ought to known better,) 
And asked her to share my lot; 
Next day I 
met her " feller," and he thumped me in the smell-
er, 
That was all the answer I 
got. 
SPOKEN.- 011, I 
tell you it is a 
horrible thing to contemplate 
—just to think that I 
am left to enjoy single " wretchedness," 
while— 
Cuonus. 
There's the horse and the steer, the goat and the deer, 
The hornet, the wasp and the flea; 
The fussy little coon, and the ugly old b
.aboon, 
Oh, they've all got a 
wife but me. 
I 
suppose you have noticed some folks are peculiar 
And never can they well enough let alone. 
But matters still push of results irregardless, 
Until every prospect completely has flown. 
Advice that is given they pass quite unheeded. 
They think they've been born ' neath some bright lucky star, 
Until when to the fact I 
have named they awaken 
And find they have gone just a 
little too far. 
Now the big ferry line which leads over to Brooklyn 
Has adopted a 
scheme the newsboys to defeat, 
And also prevent them from retailing tickets, 
While honestly earning their bread in the street. 
The ferries are owned by a 
rich corporation; 
For the poor children's suffering they don't seem 
The greater their wealth the more grasping their natures, 
But I 
think they have gone just a 
little too far. 
to care— 
We've been bothered some time with an Excise Commission. 
Whose actions I 
think you'll pronounce very queer, 
They have strained every point to refuse dealers license 
And thus to deprive us of our Sunday beer. 
Our Teutonic friends they are greatly excited, 
And strongly they kick 'gainst the vile excise law, 
And express their opinions in terms very bitter— 
"Dose tam oxcise pizness vas goin' too far," 
Now there Henry Ward Beecher our most noted preacher, 
Who was foolish enough but last summer to say, 
That a 
poor laboring man should provide for his family 
upon the small sum of a 
dollar a 
day. 
But if ever he practiced the doctrine he preaches, 
A 
great change would sure come to this divine star, 
And as he was feasting upon " bread and water" 
He'd find he had gone just a 
little too far. 
I 
suppose the old " Tammany Ring" is forgotten 
Which once ran New York in its own private way-, 
But the jusfee adminstered unto its leaders 
Has been badly mixed I 
fffil sorry to say; 
Genet, and Sweeney are taking things easy, 
With no chilling prospect their pleasures to mar, 
While generous old Bill Tweed is lying in prison. 
Now I 
think this has gone altogether too far. 
Last evening I 
got myself into a 
pickle, 
When my hearts dearest object I 
dropped in to sea. 
On the sofa together we were cozily sitting 
And I 
am afraid I 
was almost too free, 
For she sprang to her feet with her eyes fairly blazing, 
Said she " you just skip' or Ill call my papa." 
I 
tried hard to square it but she would'nt have it, 
She said " I 
had gone just a 
little too far." 
Written expressly for 1,11.71,E BOB by BEN DODGE. 
There is something which I 
wish to mention to von, 
While trying to please with my song. 
Some solid advice unto you 1 
will give : 
Please listen its not very long. 
Your attention 111 call to the poor little boys 
You will meet on the street every day. 
Do not spurn them aside with a 
curse or a 
kick, 
When by chance they are thrown in your way. 
CHORUS. 
Don't think they're too small to be noticed at all, 
Let them share in your sorrows and joys. 
Their love will repay your kindness some day, 
Don't forget to be kind to the boys. 
If a 
poor boy accosts you while trying to earn, 
By honest means but half a 
dime, 
If you have it to spare, buy a 
paper at once. 
Or invest when he proffers a 
shine. 
He has loved ones at home who upon him depend, 
For the poor crusts of bread which they eat 
And the brave honest boy to provide them with food, 
Has to labor each day in the street. 
Don't think they're too small, ke. 
The greatest of statesmen were once small like me. 
And no one can tell what's in store 
For a 
boy in the future if upright he proves, 
No matter if now he is poor. 
So unheeded don't pass the advice which I 
give: 
But by your applause let me see, 
That you promise to ever be kind to the boys, 
And I 
hope you'll begin here with me. 
CHORUS 
Don't think I'm too small to be noticed at all, 
But kindly give me your applause. 
My love will repay your kindness some day, 
Don't forget I 
am one of the boys.

It seemed to me an age, 
The answer through the personals came 
For gent in Broadway stage;

We'll meet to-morrow night.

Next evening after dark. 
'Twas my desire, and her's as well, 
To have a

could not tell you, 
But when you catch a 
pretty girl, 
I'll tell you what to do.

In this world of sorrow, of Lill and regret. 
There are scenes I

But stern truth compels that each fact must be told, 
That thro' life we may check them the more. 
Is it right that a

On the pipes by the sweat of his brow, 
Should wait like a

Or else home in hunger to go?

With the coal arid provisions run short,

For the victims that lay far below,

0OURTING IN THE RAIN. 
ONE April morn, when walking down, 
A 
quiet country lane, 
I 
overtook a 
fair young girl, 
Whilst hurrying through the rain. 
I 
asked her " If she would accept 
My arm and take 
share 
Of my umbrella ?" " Thanks, kind Sir, 
I 
will," replied the fair. 
• 
SPOKEN.—One with golden locks, by Jove, and without Cytte 
of those useful articles (holding up iTmbrella)--when she

THIS world's a 
cold and selfish one, 
As many thousands know; 
Who once were blessed with hope and joy, 
But now are fallen low. 
Whose hearts were ever kind and warm, 
Nor turned from grief aside; 
But always lent a 
listening ear, 
When pain and sorrow sighed. 
Then let us aid their sad distress, 
For we like them perchance, 
May crave the favor of the world, 
To give us another chance. 
We canhot search their breaking hearts, 
To know the anguish there, 
But kindly acts may heal their smart. 
And soothe their sad despair, 
For many whom you meet to-day. 
In sorrow broken down 
Possesses hearts as kind and true, 
Ard noble a$, thine own, 
Then do not turn away from then, 
With cold and haughty glance, 
But lift your fallen brother up, 
And give him another chance. 
The riches of the world were made, 
Not for a 
selfish end; 
But that we generously might spare, 
Some, for a 
suffering friend, 
No matter what the faults may be. 
Concealed within his heart, 
To save the wretched erring one, 
Is a 
true and manly part: 
Then, when you see a 
fallen man, 
With sorrow in his glance, 
Don't crush him farther in the dust, 
But give him another chance. 
THE MARBLE ARCH, 
Sung, with great success by EDDIE NORWOOD. 
AS I 
strayed beneath a 
marble arch, one evening in July, 
A 
maiden fair, with golden hair, came gently tripping by; 
The lustre of her diamond eyes, shone on me like a 
torch, 
And in a 
whisper soft she said, is this the marble arch? 
CHORUS. 
Then round her lovely form I 
drew my magic. circle, 
I 
pressed her, I 
caressed her, my brain was in a 
whirl, 
Around her lovely form I 
drew my magic circle, 
hissed her and I 
called her a 
very pretty girl. 
I 
took iser to 
shady spot beneath the spreading trees, 
I 
took bold orher : ily.white hand, and fell down on my knees; 
Beloved, cried 1, arise, said she, and before I 
had time to speak 
rhe imprinted a 
one burning kiss upon my blooming cheek. 
Then round her lovely form, & c. 
Good-night, says she, in a 
voice so sweet, and gently squeezed 
my hand, 
My knees began to knock and shake, for I 
could scarcely stand: 
We'll meet again some other night, and then prepare to march, 
But wheFe, cried I, she then replied, beneath that mffrble arch, 
Then round her lovely form, & c. 
However, since that fatal night, I 
have not seen my queen, 
But I've heard them say she's run away with a 
big fat horse

I'll never put it on her hand, I'll stick it through her nose.

OU NEVER MISS THE WATEE, TILL Mt 
WELL RUNS DRY. 
WHEN a 
child I 
lived at Lincoln with my parents at the farm, 
The lessons that my mother taught to me were quite a 
charm; 
She would often take me on her knee when tired of childish 
play, 
And as she pressed me to her breast I've heard my mothet 
say— 
Waste not, want not, is a 
maxim I 
would teach; 
Let your watchword be 
dispatch," .and practice what you 
preach; 
Do not let your chances, like sunbeams, pass you by, 
For you never miss the water till the well runs dry. 
As years raid on I 
grew to be a 
mischief-making boy, 
Destruction seem'd my only sport, it was my only joy; 
And well do I 
remember, when ofttimes well chastised, 
How father sat beside me then and thus has me advised. 
Waste not, & c. 
When I 
arrived at manhood, I 
embark'd in public life, 
And found it was a 
rugged road bestrewn with eare and strife? 
I 
speculated foolishly, my losses were severe, 
But still a 
tiny, little voice kept whisp'ring in mine ear. 
Waste not, tte. 
Then I 
studied strict economy, and found, to my surprise, 
My funds, instead of sinking, very quickly then did rise, 
I 
grasp'd each chance and always struck the iron while ' two.;

A 
MESSAGE FROM THE POOR, 
Written by HARRY W OODSON. 
(Air—" Letter in the Candle.") 
Copyrighted by A. S. 
FISHER, 98 Nassau St., N. Y. 
There's a 
message from the many, 
From the many to the few, 
Toiling millions ask for justice 
From the rich, which is their due; 
Honest workers toiling, sighing, 
Crowning hearts as true as steel, 
Suffering, starving, groaning, dying, 
'Neath oppression's iron heel. 
CHORUS. 
Then give to the poor 
The hand of free good will, 
And help your struggling brother 
To climb life's rugged hill; 
Truth makes the man, 
And not his money bags, 
For crime oft stands in broadcloth, 
Whilst honesty's in rags. 
To the rich the poor are step-stones, 
Stepping stones to fortune's dower, 
Er 
grinding down their wages, 
Up they mount to wealth and power ; 
Oh, ye purse-proud sons of mammon, 
Whilst you o'er your riches gloat, 
Don't forget that honest people 
Often wear a 
ragged coat. 
Then give, etc. 
Written and composed by HARRY KEARNEY, and respectfully 
dedicated to HARRY W OODSON. 
There are many ups and downs in this rugged road of life, 
And sad sufferings some folks undergo, 
Through trouble, toil and sorrow, with bitter care and strife; 
Those who've wealth, such sufferings do not know. 
When you see a 
poor man starving, oh, help him if you can! 
And try and be a 
friend to those in need. 
Who can tell but you some day may need a 
helping hand, 
Then prove yourself the poor man's friend, indeed. 
Cuoitus. 
But this maxim is the best, help the poor man in distress. 
No matter what his station or his creed, 
For its always best you'll find to the poor man to be kind. 
So prove yourself the poor man's friend in deed. 
Capitalists, now say. that one dollar for each day, 
Is enough to buy a 
laboring man his bread; 
But on that they cannot live, wages higher they must give, 
For hunger's bitter pangs we all do dread. 
Now our preachers say the same, and for them it is a 
shame, 
In the pulpit, they say help those who need, 
With their thousands every year, if they'd give a 
little free'r 
They'd prove themselves the poor man's friend, indeed. 
There are many men now gone who helped those forlorn, 
And the poor man prays for them both night and day, 
And there's many now that's worse, that gets the poor 
man's curse. 
While their prayers are for better, now I 
say, 
Jim Fisk so good and true, on the poor man did bestow, 
A 
loaf of bread to those who most did need; 
And though Tweed now lies in jail, we tell of him the same 
tale, 
They proved themselves the poor ma.'s friend, indeed. 
When but a 
little boy, oh, it really was my joy 
To visit the theatre, I'll admit, 
And how happy I 
would be, the performances to see 
While seated in the gallery or pit. 
I 
fancied all was real, that the curtain did reveal, 
But since that I 
have passed beyond my teens; 
I 
begin to understand, though in front it may look grand 
It's very different just behind the scenes. 
o 
if if you will attend for a 
moment, now my friends, 
do the best within my humble means, 
To show to you to-night, though in front it may look bright, 
It's very different just behind the scenes. 
The comedian is one, who, while causing lots of fun, 
his heart may yet hang heavy in his breast; 
And he who plays the king, though it seems a 
curious thing, 
In private may be very poorly dressed. 
Then the ballet girl so fair, who goes floating through the air, 
And looks like little angels there instead ; 
Sometimes they have to roam, into a 
wretched home, 
And oftentimes go supperless to bed. 
And those who play the parts, of the men with stony hearts, 
And look as if their tempers were like fiends; 
Could you see them while away, you certainly would say 
They're the mildest looking men behind the scenes. 
Now there's many a 
married pair, I've no doubt you are aware, 
Who in public are so tender and so kind; 
• 
But could you only see them at home in privacy, 
A 
very different state of things you (1 
find. 
Sometimes it is the wife who causes all the strife, 
sometimes it is the husband who's to blame; 
But be that as it may, who causes all the fray, 
Their quarreling continues just the same. 
And oft they try to hide from all the world outside, 
The snarls and jars with which their household teems , 
And often when you hear them call each other dear, 
They hate each other just behind the scenes. 
Now its just the samo in life, though what lots of care and 
strife. 
And suffering some folks will undergo 
Just to cut a 
shine, and to make the rselves look fine, 
They think of nothing else but outside show. 
Some fancy and suppose, that those who wear good clothes, 
Always are they richest and the best ; 
But an honest heart and mind, is respected most you'll find, 
No matter whether rich or poorly dressed. 
Then no matter where we go, from the highest to the low, 
From peasantry ' way up to kings or queens, 
Whatever we enjoy, therk28 something to annoy, 
If we could only peep behind the scenes.

A new idea for a 
song, taken from the 'column in the S. Y. 
Herald, called the "Complaint Book," written by TONY 
PASTOR, and sung by PRANK LEWIS. 
The hit 
of the season at the Academy 
of 
Music, 
Pittsburg. 
Of course in search of novelties are people now-a- days, 
New subjects they are sure to find in novels, songs and plays: 
But if in search of something new, you only have to look 
And read the various grumbles in the Herald "Complaint 
Book." 
POKEN.—This is from a 
gentleman who takes his meals out— 
Mr. Editor, in the restaurant where I 
make my daily calls, 
I 
fonnd an India rubber shoe in one of my codfish balls; 
Now, will I 
sue the proprietor, or will I 
punch the cook ? 
Or will [ show the rascal up in the Herald " Complaint Book?" 
SPOKEN.—In 
regards to the stage— 
There's a 
question I 
would like to ask, aud an answer I 
expect, 
Why Mabel Leonard from the stage they forcibly eject? 
While the ragged urchins on the street they quietly overlook, 
Our Commissioners should look after them. 
Put that down on 
the book. 
SPOKEN.—From a 
respectable married lady— 
I've been married now live years or more, and have neither 
kith nor kin, 
And in the shape of a 
family there's nothing yet been seen; 
While Mrs. Jones, across the way, on a 
pair of twins can look, 
Won't some one stir my husband up in the Herald " Complaint 
Book ?" 
Oh, mother, what do they mean by blue, 
And what do they mean by gray. 
Was heard from the lips of a 
little child, 
As she bounded in from play. 
The mother's eyes filled up with tears, 
She turned to her darling fair, 
And smoothed away from the sunny brow, 
Its treasures of golden hair. 
Why, mother's eyes are blue my sweet, 
And grandpa's hair is grey, 
And the love we bear our darling child, • 
Grows stronger every day; 
But what did they—persisted the child— 
For I 
saw two cripples to- day, 
And one of them said he fought for the blue, 
The other, he fought for the gray. 
Now, he of the blue had lost a 
leg, 
The other had but one arm; 
And both seemed worn and weary and sad, 
Yet their greeting was kind and warm. 
They told of battles of days gone by, 
Till it made my young blood thrill. 
The leg was lost in the Wilderness fight, 
And the arm on Malvern Hill. 
They sat on the stone by the farm-yard gate, 
And talked for an hour more, 
Till their eyes grew bright, and their warm hearts seemed, 
With fighting their battles o'er, 
And parting at last with a 
friendly grasp, 
In a'kindly, brotherly way; 
Each called on God, to speed the time, 
'Uniting the blue and the gray, s

'Tis fair as an Eden with beautiful flowers,

One warm day in summer we sat ' neath the shade, 
Her hand within mine I 
held fast. 
So earnestly talking to her, I'm afraid 
I 
knew not how quickly time passed; 
I 
begged her to join me through life's coming hours. 
She promised that she'd be my wife,

An original song of the escape of the Fenians' from Australia 
as written and sung by the great Irish Comedian and Vocalist. 
JAMES O'NEIL. 
NOW boys if you will listen, to the story Ill relate, 
HI tell you of the noble men, who from the foe escaped. 
Though bound with Saxon fetters, in the dark Australian jail, 
They struck a 
blow for freedom, and for Yankee land set sail. 
On the 17th of April last, the stars and stripes did fly, 
On board the bark Catalpa, waving proudly to the sky. 
She showed the green above the red, as she () id calmly lay, 
Prepared to take the Fenian boys, in safety o'er the sea. 
When Breslin and brave Desmond, brought the prisoners to the 
shore, 
They gave one shout for freedom, soon to bless them ever more 
And manned by gallant hearts they pulled towards the Yankee 
flag, 
For well they knew from its proud folds, no tryant could them 
drag. 
They have nearly reached in safety the Catalpa, taut and trim, 
When fast approaching them they saw a 
vision dark and dim. 
It was the steamer " Georgette," and on her deck there stood, 
One hundred hired assassins, to shed each patriot's blood. 
The steamer reached the bounding bark, and tired across her 
bow, 
They in loud voice commanded, that the vessel should 
Heave 
to." 
but noble Captain Anthony, in thunder tones did cry, 
You dare not fire a 
shot at that bright flag, that floats on high. 
My ship is sailing peacefully beneath that flag of stars, 
rts manned by Irish hearts of oak, and manly Yankee tars. 
And that dear emblem at the fore, so plain now to be seen, 
'Tis the banner I'll protect, old Ireland's flag of green. 
The Britisher he sailed away, from the stars and stripes he ran' 
He knew his chance was slim to fight, the boys of Uncle Sam, 
So Hogan, Wilson, Harrington with Darragh off did go, 
With Hassett and bold Cranston, soon to whip the Saxon foe. 
Here's luck to that noble captain, who well these men did free, 
He dared the English-man-of-war, to fight him on the sea. 
And here's to that dear emblem, which in triumph shall be seen 
The flag for which those patriots fought, dear Irelands flag of 
green, 
Sung with great success by TONY PASTOR. 
The ups and downs of this great world, 
Would fill a 
mighty book, 
But those in luxury pass by, 
And seldom chance to look 
On those whom fortune has not blest, 
With friendship's pitying eye, 
But hear his story with a.shrug, 
Anti coldly pass him by (with)— 
CHORUS. 
Hit him again, he's got no friends, 
Drive him away from the door; 
Hit him. again, he's got no friends, 
What good is a 
man when he's poor ? 
A man of wealth may 'be a 
lion 
hi party, club or ball, 
Courted by men of high clegree, 
By ladies great and small; 
But speculations fickle hand, 
May sweep away his gold, 
What then do men of high degree, 
What, wil the ladies say ? (why)— 
Hit him again, etc. 
But then the road is very long, 
That turns not in its way, 
For tides wiil rise, the cat will mew, 
The dog will have his day; 
The rich man now may then be poor, 
The poor man have his place, 
And he who snubs today may look 
Into the other's face (and say)— 
Hit him again, etc,

LITTLE DARLING, DO YOU LOVE ME? 
Written and sung by BEN DODGE. 
Little darling, do yon love me, 
Will you ever care for me? 
While far from you I

O'er life's dark and stormy sea; 
For I

And my heart will e'er be true, 
And in time I'll gladly hasten 
Back again to home and you. 
Little darling, do you love me '2 
Will you ever care for me. 
While far from you I 
am wandering, 
O'er life's dark and stormy sea? 
Little darling do you miss me 
As away from you I 
roam 
Will you greet me with a 
welcome 
When we meet again at home ? 
Shall I

See your bright and happy smile, 
And, far better, hear you whisper— 
" 
I

And when you have heard it, no doubt you'll agree. 
That things in town are not as they should be; 
In the first place, we hear a

But unless they soon do it, between you and me,

The great social evil to- day, I've no doubt, 
Is the poor homeless tramp, who goes wandering about. 
lie cannot find shelter or food, if he tries; 
What cares the cold world, if he sickens and dies: 
Perhaps in his youth, he'd a

But cruel misfortune has caused him to roam ;

Boss Tweed is a 
man most talked about now, 
His departure last winter caused a 
great row; 
Of course we all know it was not a 
square game, 
But show me the man who would not do the same; 
When Sweeny, Genet and Dick Connelly took flight, 
lie stood here alone and made a 
good light; 
lie did wrong, but when poor men were grmtly in need, 
The first to assist them was William M. Tweed.

Determined to conquer or die.

No matter whatever you lag; 
If you should have the honor to adopt this land. 
Pray never go back on the flag.

f American Fortune-Telling Cards.—This is tme old-

published it for years, and the demand is continually increasing-
These Cards are arranged and printed in series—Hearts, Clubs, Dia-
monds and Spades—and each or these into H for King, Q for Queen. 
and K 
for Knave, and numbers 1, 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
lour rows, and are to be read according to directions. Many of the an. 
ewers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. 
The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under-
standing. 
Many professional Fortune-Tellers use these cards, and we 
are in receipt of letters in relation to them from all parts of the U. S. 
Enclosed in handsome case....

Courting Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too diffi. 
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. The lady'is restrained, by custom and a 
sense a 
propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unlady-like encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, manylives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
oulty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes further explanation un-
necessary. 
The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players. 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties

pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of figures.

of Harlequin, in his tesselated suit • the next only Columbine, then 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding
