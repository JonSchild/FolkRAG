Greetings from N

 B
uzzing a
long here w

2½ month t

 They'll  be going
 
a
ll over, from coast to coast while I stay h
ome and tend t
o
 
b
usiness.
 
B
iggest news from here i
s that Mandy h
as won 3rd P
lace i
n
 
a C
ity-wide poetry c
ontest which attracted over 200 entries.
 
I
've sent her w
inning poem a
long (
she got a $
100 g
ift certifi-
c
ate).
 What's even more remarkable i
s t
hat she was c
ompeting
 
w
ith students i
n h
igh school, t
he contest was open to people
 
i
n 7th t
o 1
2th grades!
 She started her l
ast year i
n m
iddle
 
school  (
8th grade) yesterday and i
s Student Council  President
 
for her c
lass!
 She's t
ill  r
iding and w
inning medals i
n t
he
 
various competitions b
ut I don't know how much l
onger we can
 
afford to go i
n for t
he h
orse shows and l
essons etc.  a
s it i
s
 
frightfully expensive.
 
John N

 I
'm quite worried
 
about h

ut am g
lad to see t

w
ill actually be working at a job.
 He's been doing l
ots of
 
writing b
ut hasn't gotten around t
o p
ublishing anything a
s of
 
yet so t
he physical  l
abor on a k
ibbutz should be good for h
im
 
as well a
s t
o yield experiences he can p
ut down i
n writing.
 
Melanie i
s now m
idway t
hrough her 2 year Master's Program
 
for Social Work, a
iming t
o go into counseling.
 She i
s moving
 
more i
nto a work-based, rather than a curriculum i
ntensive phase
 
so she s
hould be over t
he h
ump, at l
east academically.
 We've
 
h
ad a pretty quiet s
ummer a
ll  t
old w
ith just a b
lip i
n t
he
 
routine for an angioplasty I had a
s a r
esult of having a m
ild
 
heart attack during a treadmill  t
est early in June.
 H

ospital and was t
old t
o c
ut out c
igarettes
 
and am working h
ard at doing just t
hat b
ut h
aven't a
ltogether
 
done s
o,  t
hough I h
ave c
ut down by 75-90%.
 Am a
lso working on
 
improving d
iet and keeping up w
ith my exercise program.
 H
aven't
 
felt any i
ll  effects save for a b
it of depression which l
ifted
 
a
s soon as I went off one of t
he prescribed medicines once I
 
had been on t

 F

NASHVILLE: MUSIC CITY USA NOW IN  
BOOKSTORES
 
NASHVILLE -
-
 The publication of NASHVILLE: MUSIC CITY USA has made
 
author John Lomax III a very happy, and relieved, man.
 "It took three
 
years of the hardest work I
've ever done but I believe that NASHVILLE:
 
MUSIC CITY USA is the best book ever written on that city and its world
 
renowned music industry", remarked the author, 41.
 
Lomax is also delighted to forge his own link in the family tradition.
 
"My grandfather began collecting cowboy songs in the 1880's", Lomax added.
 
"His first book, COWBOY SONGS AND OTHER FRONTIER BALLADS, was published
 
exactly 75 years ago", noted Lomax, adding that his aunt, uncle,  father,
 
brother and two cousins are also published authors of books about music.
 
In addition to 75,000 words and 240 illustrations (
104 in color),
 
NASHVILLE: MUSIC CITY USA also contains seventy-five capsule biographies,
 
twenty-one lists and "The Ultimate Country Chart", a compilation which
 
features over 2
,400 facts about more than 150 of Nashville's leading music
 
figures.
 
The author embarks September 29 on a promotional tour which will take
 
him to Dallas, Fort Worth, Houston, St. Louis and Atlanta.
 Additional
 
visits are planned for Memphis, Lexington, Louisville, Cincinnati, Little
 
Rock,  Indianapolis, Knoxville, Chattanooga and Birmingham.
 Lomax will also
 
make several appearances in Nashville during the events of "Country Music
 
Week", October 10-19.
 
NASHVILLE: MUSIC CITY USA carries a suggested list price of $29.95.

 Pursuant to the terms of the Will,  after the death
 
of the widow,  the residue of the estate was to be divided

had four children,  John A.  Lomax,  Jr.,  Alan Lomax,  Bess Lomax
 
Hawes and Shirley Lomax Duggan.
 John A.  Lomax,  Jr.  died in
 
1974 and is survived by one child;  John A.  Lomax,  III.
 You
 
further warrant and represent that Alan Lomax,  Bess Lomax
 
Hawes,  Shirley Lomax Duggan and John Lomax III are the sole
 
surviving heirs and own all rights in the musical compositions
 
written by John A.  Lomax,  Sr.  and are solely and exclusively
 
entitled to any and all royalties payable to the performances
 
of his works.

 The word "period"  shall mean the term from
 
October 1,  1987 and ending September 30,  1989 and
 
continuing thereafter for additional terms of two  (2)
 
years each unless terminated by either party by the end
 
of said initial term or any additional term upon notice

After 8 years here,  I seem to have convinced the clique which runs
 
this town that I am serious about my career in the country music bus-
iness.
 Some of the folks here are even cogniznat of '
the Lomax'  family
 
and the rather formidable heritage I have to equal or surpass.
 And,  try
 
as I might,  I just cannot find any unrecorded Negroes!  Maybe I should
 
move to Australia and look there!
 I
'm starting to really enjoy reading
 
my own writing and I have found myself able to dash off an occasional
 
pi ce at the typewriter,  rather than going through the more comfortable
 
  rather laborious process of starting by hand with the old yellow
 
legal pad.
 
Jeannie and I are planning to make a Texas trip during the lovely
 
month of August.
 Johnny will be visiting Bidy's parents then and we
 
have been invited to:  a
)  Leave Amanda with Jeannie's parents & b) Visit
 
Johnny Faulk in Madisonville sometime after he resumes residence, post
 
July 27.
 If at all possible I would like to arrange a l
ink up even if
 
we only have time to fly to Lubbock for 2 or 3 days.
 I feel so much
 
more like I can f
inally hold my head up high at the family gatherings,
 
not so much because I have in any way matched the monumental achievements
 
of my dad and John Avery and Alan and Bess, but because I can finally say
 
that I have hacked out a place for myself,  all by myself, and can see th
 
way clear to make   
 
impressive marks in slightly different fields
 
It also occurs to me that grandfather was 14) 100 years ago, about the age
 
at which he began hanging out with cowboys and writing down their songs.
 
I
t gives me a great deal of inner satisfaction to find that 12,000 months
 
later, a Lomax is still out there,  doing much the same thing, given the
 
inevitable modernization of the industry and technology.
 
Please let us hear from you and tell me if that new husband of
 
yours i
s giving you a hard time.
 From all that Joe tells me, he's slightly
 
better than the cat's pajamas,  so  I
'm eager to swap stories.

oving nephew,

Dear Aunt Shirley:
 
I hope that you are doing well and that your visit with Bess and
 
Alan went as smoothly as any gathering of Lomaxes can be expected.
 
The book is receiving terrific reviews and is selling enough to
 
keep the company interested.
 I hope that you like it and will excuse
 
the errors in the "Intro":  they were corrected in galley for
.iii but,  for
 
reasons inknown to me, were not altered before printing.
 
I
'm not sure of my next move so in t
he interim I
'm putting together
 
a photo book about country songwriters with a very crazy, and very
 
talented,  former Pulitzer Prize winning photographer named Kal Roberts
 
We hope to finish up this spring with pics of the best 70-80 living
 
country songwriters,  all done up in high quality B&W and printed on high
 
gloss paper.
 There's no other book like it out there so we should do
 
pretty well with the project and enjoy a lot of business over the next 10
 
years.
 
My agent is shopping two ideas I
've got for a subsequent book.
 One
 
is a biography of Brenda Lee and the other is a long,  involved, non-musical
 
photo book/contest that sounded to me too good to miss.
 We'll see.
 
Now we come to the unpleasant part of this missive:  I need to borrow
 
$10,000 to get myself in order with the IRS.
 The reason I am in this
 
pickle is hard to explain but it involves my divorce settlement, poorly
 
timed investments in gold,  silver and gold mining stock, a srastic drop

in my income for l85 due to forces beyond my cortro1 and cash flow shortfalls
 
that have been interminable and were,  in fact, a principal cause for my
 
recent divorce.
 
I can handle a repayment schedule involving 24 payments over the next
 
two years and I am pretty much at your mercy as far as an interest rate
 
goes as all my liquid collateral is already pledged and the house in Houston
 
is unlikely to sell for at least a year.
 
Oh,  such a nasty subject and one which I hate to introduce and would
 
not do so if I could find another way out.
 I will continue to cherish you
 
no matter what your decision and I am very embarrassed about this but I
 
have apparently cut things a little too close this time.
 In such cases,
 
a person is ready to explore all avenues.

 Pnianda is ready to be 6 and is obviously very

 Her mother and I have so far enjoyed a very
 
"civilized" divorce built around what's best for the child but that doesn't
 
mean the parting was without sorrow.
 
Talked to Johnny Faulk and got his rave reviews on the book.

he's always been a Lomax fanatic but praise from such as he has buoyed me
 
greatly.
 
Shirley, I feel as if I

Greetings!
 I hope you '
are doing well,  "

s
 
M
imi  u
sed to say.
 I have some things I need to get off my c
hest,
 
matters  I have wanted to say to you both for a long t
ime.
 This i
s my
 
fourth or f
ifth attempt to say them -
 so what follows s
hould be fairly
 
succinct.
 
Have e
ither of you ever tried to l
ook at t
he world t
hrough my eyes?
 
From my v
iewpoint?  Here i
s what I s
ee.
 
A 44 year-old man struggling to f
ind acceptance from a pair of
 
r
elatives whose musical achievements are so staggering t
hat my m
ind
 
boggles to think of them a
ll.
 I see an u
ncle who d
iscovered Muddy Waters,
 
nurtured Woody Guthrie
., Jelly Roll Morton and Bob D
ylan, heln
ied t
he
 
L

ongress L

s today r
ecognized
 
a
s t
he s
ingle most knowledgeable person i
n t
he world on t
he subject of
 
our p
lanet's music.
 
I see an aunt who co-wrote a c
lassic American song, "M.T.A.", who
 
taught guitar (
a subject I couldn't learn) to t
housands, who has out-
l
asted over a h
alf dozen Presidents and who has become perhaps t
he most
 
beloved f
igure i
n American folk music.
 
I see a grandfather I never k
now who started a
ll of t
his.
 A brilliant,
 
but d
ifficult man who was seduced i
nto music by the songs of drifting
 
cowboys whilst still a
, teenager -
 over one hundred years ago.

And I see my father who d
ied before I could d
evelop my music industry
 
skills, a man who a
lmost casually managed t
he career of one of t
he world's
 
top b
luesmen, helped d
iscover another and founded the Houston F

t

o pass it a
long to my c
hildrcn
 
and to my friends.
 
Being a Lomax I have c
hosen a d
ifferent path to continue t
his
 
tradition than you have selected.
 (
You expect me to go out a
nd f

collect against that sort of r
ecord?)
 
What I would really l
ike to know are answers to the following:
 
When w
ill you both start treating me a
s a

Am I wrong to expect e
ither of you to g
ive me a l
ittle more help
 
emotionally t
han you have so far? (
in l
oco parantis).
 
Can  I e
ither receive some approval  from e
ither of you r
egarding
 
my own career to date -
 or some constructive criticism r
egarding same?
 
What do I have to do to feel  l
ike I have e
arned the r
ight to carry
 
on t
his family's musical  tradition?
 
I hope t
hat you can r
espond promptly to these matters a
s t
hey
 
trouble me greatly and I would l
ike to resolve t
hen, if possible, before

it's l
onesome out here with no mother, father or brother.

Dear Johnny,
 
I am sorry to have been silent so l
ong after your letter of June 13.  It is a very
 
difficult letter to answer because you addressed so many different issues, and I
 
still don't know which are the more important.
 
One thing that seems to have been bothering you specially is that your parents died
 
before you could show them how well you have turned out.  I sympathize with this
 
because the same thing happened to me.  It happens to most people, actually, and
 
there isn't much to be done about it that I
've found.  In my own case, for all the
 
years I lived in California I didn't use my maiden name at all because I was so hell
 
bent on establishing that if I did anything worth remembering, it must be on my own,
 
not because I was a Lomax.  Now when I look back, I wonder why I bothered.  It didn'
 
really matter to anybody in the world except me...
 
But then there are other parts of your letter that suggest that you're mostly con-
cerned over issues of control over Lomax song copyrights and book royalties and s
tuf
 
l
ike that.  Let me lay out my position on this as plainly as I can.  A long time ago
 
the four senior family members, including your father, empowered Alan to handle a
ll
 
issues concerning copyright fees and reprint rights for the estate for two reasons:
 
he was the active party in the music field at the time, and his personal private
 
share of the work was intricately involved and continually had to be combed out of
 
the joint property issues.
 
I still adhere to that agreement.  Alan has, over the years, given a great deal of
 
personal time and effort to the handling of the family estate business, and I think
 
he should continue to do so as l
ong as he wishes.  I was disappointed that he didn't
 
mention your assistance in working out the BMI agreement, but that didn't really
 
alter my basic opinion.  I have my own life crises to attend to just now, and an
 
inter-family war over song royalties (
a topic that has always made me feel uncom-
fortable anyway) is simply not in my future.  I also have nothing to offer on the
 
subject of biographies of John A.  Alan would l
ike to work with somebody l
ike James
 
Michener or a biographer of national priminence on such a volume.  I hope eventually
 
he can; at any rate, he has the right to make that choice.
 
Somewhere in this area, though, may l
ie the issues which have caused us misunder-
standings.  As a grown man, you chose to go into the commercial side of what you
 
refer to as the music industry.  That is certainly where a lot of action takes place,
 
and both Alan and I have danced in and out of that territory from time to time in the
 
past.  Personally, I always got burned.  My only commercial success -
-
 the MTA -
-
was a total fluke and a complete surprise to me.  I also am a mouldy fig and a pretty
 
,
 fair working folklorist.  Neither position leaves me feeling especially competent to
 
on the various business adventures you've undertaken in Nashville; the
 
issues that surface in the music industry are very far removed from the issues that
 
face the traditional old-time singers and players of all the ethnicities, occupations
 
and religions that I am concerned with these days.  We are working on quite different
 
problems in quite different ways.  And why shouldn't we?  What is wrong with that?
 
Can't we be engaged in different labours and still be friends?
 
And so I come back to the ultimate sadness as far as I am concerned: that what Alan
 
and I may or may not think of what you are doing disturbs you so much.  WN The two
 
of us are surrounding 70 -
-
 he on the far side and me on the near.  We are by no mean
 
clones, and I was rather startled that you wrote as though we were.  Speaking for
 
myself, I have absolutely all I can do to chart my own personal course through the
 
complex waters of the current world that I so often do not understand.  What occasion
 
or what right do I have to approve or disapprove of what you do?  I don't even assume
 
that right in the case of my own children.  They too are adults and manage their own
 
lives -
-
 pretty well too, I think -
-
 and we all try to concentrate on being friends.
 
That's a hard job all of itself -
-
 being good friends.
 
I guess the motion of a family tradition can really twist things around and it does
 
seem that the Lomax one sticks in your craw.  You don't have to "earn" any right to
 
carry it on, though.  It's just a perfectly good tradition, full of juice, and it's
 
just lying out there ready for anybody to carry it on, in or out of the family, who
 
wants to do all that work.  Some people are taking care of part of it already.  You're
 
not trapped.
 
I hope you go on and do the work you enjoy and can make a living at.  And NN W that i
s
 
no longer satisfying to you, I hope you will feel totally free to stop it and try some-
thing else.  There's a fellow in Atlanta named Lomax -
-
 a black one, I believe -
-
 who
 
is running for mayor.  There's Lomaxes doing all kinds of things.  What about  ournali
 
I always thought your best writing was in those pieces you sent me from the Nashville
 
paper some years back.  Please understand -
-
 I
'm not trying to suggest you shouldn't b
 
doing what you are doing; it's fine with me.  I just get the feeling from your letter
 
that you've buildt yourself a l
ittle pen and crawled in it and slammed the door, and
  
I
'm hoping that I can help you see that if you made
 ou can un-make it too. And
 
then maybe you can get away from some of those old sadnesses and angers...
 
With equal parts of affection and exasperation, believe me, my dear nephew, your own
 
Aunt Bess

Fan Letter #2
 
Hello again, David Scbriaufer fans!  Thanks so much for believing in "America's
 
Dulcimer Champion"!  This is our second fan letter but it will be the first for more
 
than half of you.  We have added over 400 names to our mailing list since our first
 
communication just three months ago.
 
Have I got news f
or you!
 I
'm just busting to pass i
t all along but first perhaps
 
we should go over the fan club rules for those new to this project.  First of all, it
 
is free! From time-to-time you will be invited to purchase tapes, CD's, pictures or
 
other merchandise -
 but the newsletter itself, a quarterly project at first, is free
 
and it will contine to be.  The purpose of this letter is to assist in establishing
 
two-way comiiunicat
 ion between us and you, our most important allies.  Please send us
 
any thoughts you may have about places for David to play, possible outlets for sales of
 
recordings, tips on radio stations where we might get airplay, likely fans not already
 
on our lists, med1.  (
()n H(t
 r an
'ythin, el
-,e t
o me at Pox 120316, Nashville TN., 32712.
 
And now, the news!
 
The recording for David's second album will be complete by the time you receive
 
this.  Now, I
'm going to try to refrain from babbling about this but I am convinced
 
this second effort, to be titled DULCIMER PLAYER, is, gasp, better than DULCIMER DELUXE!!
 
"Balderdash", you may think.
 I don't want to kick sand on an album that has now
 
sold over 6
,000 copies (3,500 i
n the last six months) but when DULCIMER PLAYER hits the
 
streets around September 15th, you will quickly learn why I am so effulgent in my praises.
 
Why is this album so good?  The first reason is that there is more of David this
 
t
ime: he co-wrote eight of the songs, five with Herb McCullough, his collaborator on
 
"Twilight Eyes" and "Mr. Snow" from DULCIMER DELUXE.  David and Vince Farsetta wrote
 
three for the new album and you'll also hear Vince playing guitar and banjo on four
 
cuts.  He and David have been p
laying together for many years and I believe you're going
 
to really enjoy Vince's playing.
 
Another reason why I believe D
ULCIM E
R PLAYER is better than DULCIMER DELUXE is that
 
it showcases David in even more varied musical settings.  As you recall, DULCIMER DELUXE
 
was made up solely of instrumental solos, duos and trios.  DULCIMER PLAYER presents him
 
in the above configurations but we also have selections from a quartet and two tunes from
 
The Cactus Brothers, a 7-niece country-rock band.  David has been performing with The
 
Cactus Brothers f
or over t oo
 ars, so their i
nclusion on the album was natural.
 
Purists, please hold  or f
ire until you hear DULCI M
ER PLAYER!  Although we have
 
larger ensembles, the dulcimer is still featured as lead instrument.  Please reserve
 
judgment until you hear David and the other six Cacti romp through the old classic,
 
"Fisher's Hornpipe".
 
Mark 0
' Connor appears on three tracks including an achingly beautiful new Schnaufer-
McCullough original, "When Silence Was Golden".  Vip Vipperman and Cove Scrivenor return,
 
on guitar and autoharp, respectively.  Nashville percussion legend Kenny Malone and bassist
 
extraordinaire Dave Pomeroy make their debut appearance on a Schnaufer recording as does
 
Jack "Cowboy" Cl ement, a man whose musical achievements dwarf even the appellation
 
"
legendary".
 I
t was Clement, not Sam Phillips, who was first to record Jerry Lee Lewis.

**F
iriiiylou Harris invited David to perform as her sole backing musician for a
 
segment of the 1990 PBS-TV special, HANK WILLIAMS: A MAN AND HIS MUSIC.  The two per-
formed Williams' "May You Never Walk Alone" and the sequence was filmed at the hallowed
 
Ryman Auditorium.  Jim & Ginger Brown produced and directed -
 they also did the extra-
ordinary A VISION SHARED, the PBS Special/Home Video on the lives of Woody Guthrie and
 
Leadbelly.  The air date for the show is March, 1990!
 
**David and a local luthier, Moses Scrivenor, has
, respectively designed and built
 
the most remarkable concert dulcimer I have ever seen.
 It's made of koa wood, features
 
abalone inlay, comes complete with custom-designed Baggs pickup and -
 you are not going
 
to believe this -
 a flight-approved hard shell case, built, especially for the dulcimer!
 
For around $2,200 we can get you one of these custom-built; call (615) 356-4684 for
 
details.  This is no jive -
 three of these beauties are in use; David has one of course
 
and you will he hearing from it on DULCIM E
R PLAYER.
 
**David enjoyed a remarkable weekend in Reilville,  I
llinois recently.  Thanks to
 
Ruth Loeffler for all her positive thoughts and deeds and thanks
 
for his kind words in the local paper.

All that's left to say is that I am now managing David full-time, having recently
 
been fired from my thy job as Vice President of Airborne Records, a company I co-founded
 
less than two years ago.  This means I have more time to devote to advancing David's
 
career.  So please, let me hear from you either by mail at Box 120316, Nashville, TN.,
 
37212 or via phone at (615) 356-4684.
 If I
'm at my home/office we can chat a bit and if
 
I
'm not you can have a grand time telling my code-a-phone all that's on your mind (it
 
will record until you hang up).
 
NOTE TO RETAILERS: Please give us an estimate of your first order on DULCIMER
 
PLAYER so we will know how many tapes to initially make.  Prices and terms will be the
 
same as for DULCIMER DELUXE.
 70 minute CD's with all of DULCIMER PLAYER and most of
 
DULCIMER DELUXE will be available in October; we hope the ca
ssette of DULCIMER PLAYER
 
will be ready by September 15th.

D
ear Johnny,
 
I am s
orry to have been s
ilent s
o l
ong after your l
etter of June 1
3.  I
t i
s a very
 
d
ifficult l
etter t
o answer because you addressed so many different i
ssues, and I
 
s
till don't know which are the more important.
 
One thing that s
eems to have been bothering you specially i
s that your parents died
 
before you could show them how well you have turned out.  I sympathize with this
 
because the s
ame thing happened to me.  I
t happens to most people, actually, and
 
there i
sn't much t
o be d
one about i
t that I
've found.  In my own case, for all the
 
years I l
ived in California I didn't use my maiden name at a
ll because I was s
o hell
 
bent on e
stablishing that if I did anything worth remembering, i
t must be on my own,
 
not because I was a L
omax.  Now when I l
ook back, I wonder why I
 bothered.  I
t didn'
 
really matter to anybody in the world except me...
 
But then there are other parts of your l
etter that suggest that you're mostly con-
c
erned over i
ssues of c
ontrol over Lomax s
ong copyrights and book royalties and stuf
 
l
ike that.  L
et me lay out my position on this as plainly as I can.  A long t
ime ago
 
the f
our senior f
amily members, including your father, empowered Alan to handle a
ll
 
i
ssues c
oncerning c
opyright fees and reprint rights for the e
state for two reasons:
 
he was the active party in the music f
ield at the time, and his personal private
 
share of the work was intricately involved and continually had to be combed out of
 
the j
oint property i
ssues.
 
I s
till adhere to that agreement.  Alan has, over the years, given a great deal of
 
personal t
ime and effort to the handling of the f
amily e
state business, and I think
 
he s
hould c
ontinue t
o do so as l
ong as he wishes.  I was disappointed that he didn't
 
mention your assistance in working out the BMI agreement, but that didn't really
 
a
lter my basic opinion.  I have my own l
ife crises to attend to just now, and an
 
inter-family war over song royalties (
a t
opic that has a
lways made me feel uncom-
f
ortable anyway) i
s simply not in my future.  I also have nothing to offer on the
 
subject of biographies of John A
.  Alan would l
ike to work with somebody l
ike James
 
Michener or a biographer of national priminence on such a volume.  I hope eventually
 
he can; a
t any rat e,
 he ha
s  the right  to  make
 that
 choice.
 
Somewhere in this area, though, may l
ie the issues which have caused us misunder-
standings.  As a grown man, you chose to go into the commercial s
ide of what you
 
refer to a
s the music industry.  That i
c certainly where a lo -1
-
 of action takes place,
 
and both Alan and I
 have danced in and out of that territory from t
ime to time in the
 
past.  Personally, I a
lways got burned.  My only commercial success -
-
 the ?
.
!FA -
-
was a t
otal f
luke and a c
omplete surprise to me.  I also am a mouldy f
ig and a pretty
 
fair working f
olklorist.  Neither position leaves me feeling e
specially competent to
 
on the various business adventures you've undertaken in Nashville; the
 
i
ssues that surface in the music industry are very far removed from the issues that
 
face t
he traditional old-time s
ingers and players of a
ll the e
thnicities, occupations
 
and religions that I am c
oncerned with these days.  We are working on quite different
 
problems in quite d
ifferent ways.  And why shouldn't we?  What i
s wrong with that?
 
Can't we be engaged in d
ifferent labours and still be friends?
 
And s
o I come back t
o the ultimate sadness as far as I am concerned: that what Alan
 
and I
 may or may not think of what you are doing disturbs you so much.  WN The two
 
of us are surrounding 7
0 -
-
 he on the far s
ide and me on the near.  We are by no meam
 
c
lones, and I
 was rather s
tartled that you wrote as though we were.  Speaking f
or
 
myself, I have absolutely a
ll I can do to chart my own personal c
ourse through the
 
complex waters of the current world that I so often do not understand.  What occasion
 
or what right do I have to approve or disapprove of what you do?  I don't even assume
 
that right in the case of my own children.  They too are adults and manage their own
 
lives -
-
 pretty well too, I think -
-
 and we all try to concentrate on being friends.
 
That's a hard job all of itself -
-
 being good friends.
 
I guess the motion of a f
amily tradition can really twist things around and it does
 
seem that the Lomax one sticks in your craw.  You don't have to "earn" any right to
 
carry it on, though.  It's just a perfectly good tradition, full of juice, and it's
 
just lying out there ready for anybody to carry it on, in or out of the family, who
 
wants to do all that work.  Some people are taking care of part of it already.  You're
 
not trapped.
 
I hope you go on and do the work you enjoy and can make a living at.  And ON & that is
 
no longer satisfying to you, I hope you will feel totally free to stop it and try some-
thing else.  There's a fellow in Atlanta named Lomax -
-
 a black one, I believe -
-
 who
 
is running for mayor.  There's Lomaxes doing all kinds of things.  What about  ournali
 
I always thought your best writing was in those pieces you sent me from the Nashville
 
paper some years back.  Please understand -
-
 I
'm not trying to suggest you shouldn't b
 
doing what you are doing; it's fine with me.  I just get the feeling from your letter
 
that you've buil
 yourself a little pen and crawle  in it and slammed the door, and
 
I
'm hoping that I c
an help you see that if you made
 you can un-make it too. And
 
then maybe you can get away from some of those old sadnesses and angers...
 
With equal parts of affection and exasperation, believe me, my dear nephew, your own
