 Prank Hodsoll, Chairman
 
From:
 Bess Hawes, Folk Arts
 
Subject:
 Attached letter from Heritage nominee
 
Folk Arts has recently been busy notifying National Heritage Fellowship
 
awardees of their nominations, and as usual the experience has been most
 
gratifying.  I thought you might like to see a letter we just received
 
from Sr. Luis Ortega, the California rawhide artist whose biography you
 
might remember from the Council book.  He is not only an impressive
 
artist but a gentlem a
n of the old school, and he writes a fine letter -
-
a very moving letter, too.

I thought the attached news article from the Boston Clobe was very nice and
 
paid appropriate attention to the National Medal of A

've sent a copy to Dodie for possible inclusion in the next

After Dinner Comments
 
National
 
September 11,  1986
 
I was riding in on the subway this evening and I began,.
,think to
 
myself about something that happened to me a while back and I
 
thought 
wou ld te ll
JI
you about.
 
T
 
time ago,  a very, very long time ago,
 
it came out of my reading'V
''.,
  when I was a small child
 
that some where there was a pej 'I and that if you hVtd the
 
,Roa_
e+,I and you found the right door, you would go in and there
 
would be a staircasE� Ind if you found the right staircase lyou
 
went all the way up to the end�and
,,,you found the right door to
 
open at the end you would come into a room where there wac all
 
the books in the world and there was a little old man who sat
 
there and if you ask'�'him anything you want.�he wo uld know the
 
answer.,
'm�d I us&,to think that if I could just find that �encil
 
that there wou ld be someome there that would know everyth ing
 
of went in the back of my mind and then I got to be a teacher
 
and one day I walked into $ e class and it was all full of
 
people and they were looking at me and they were so eager and so
 
excited and I suddenly felt "0 Lord'  I
'm that person that could
 
answer  
 and I
'm suppose'to know all these
 
things and I don't really know them and gee whiz what will I do
 
nd I almost panicked and I almost ran out the door and it was a
 
very frightening thing for me to think about  nd,I realized that
 
I
'm a grown up now and that I would have to face the fact that
 
w s probably I was the best person around that knew those things
 
and could answer those questions
nd I wasn't all that good but
 
maybe I was okay atieast t
jia
it was what was there at the time.
 I
 
tell you this story because I never h  talked to n
ody who has
 
received one of the Heritage awards from the Folk Arts Program.
 
Y
i m
ad at one time told me in request of a long conversation,
 
well you know I know this and I know how to do that but gee whiz
 
you oughta seen the fella that I learned how to do this from and
 
the lady that knew all the songs that I learned and she or he or
 
all them to get that award , it wasn't me it was all those people
 
who helped me that knew all those beautiful things and had all
 
those beautiful stories to tell and were the people that should
 
have been consulted.
 But we have to l guess face up to the
 
fact; that each one of us in our own place are the best we can
 
be for the time we— can
Q_aI1d I
'm speaking directly now to all
 
Lf
l the wonderful people here who are
 
the recipients of this year's Heritage Fellowship Awards.
 You
 
are the very best people to tell evelbody else the very things
 
about your own particular art form, there isn't anybody else.
 
There isn't somebody at the end of the staircase that knows more
 
than ' o
 ur're the one at the end of the staircase
d so
 I
 
hope you will go home with the feeling that this is your charge
 
that you take home with you more than a plaque, more than a
 
letter from the President and even more than a check, and even
 
more than all the hugs that we can give you, that it's your
 
charge to make sure that your art form continues in the great
 
way that you have presented it to the rest of the country so far
 
and that the standards are kept up and that the young people are
 
brought up to be tough and to criticize themselves and to make
 
sure that they are holding up the very best standards of the
 
work that you have shown them how to do,
nd I guess that's what
 
I would like to wish all of you to take home with you
ecause
 
again I hope you will always keep in touch with us who are your
 
servants here in Washington
4he people from the Library of
 
Congress, and from the Smithsonian, and from the National
 
Endowment for the Arts whose salaries you pay in your taxes, who
 
are charged by the American people to carry on the work that you
 
assign us to do,Lnd I hope you will continue to make clear to us
 
what we are to do to make your art 1JBn continue and grow in
 
this country Mnd Iilike now to present to you the Chairman of
 
the National Endowment for the Arts whose support and whose
 
eloquence and whose breath of vision that has made possible the
 
program that we are beneficiaries of
 Mr. Frank Hodsoll, who
 
will greet you and wish you well as the Folk Arts Program which
 
is a very small part of the whole Arts Endowment but a very
 
important part does also, Mr. Frank Hodsoll.
 
MR. HODSOLL:
 
Thank you very much Bess, that is truly a hard act to follow.
 
That was a wonderful, wonderful statement, as fine a statement
 
indeed as I
've ever heard of the passing on that goes on among
 
all of you who were honored today and many others of you who are
 
in this room.
 I think from the overall National Endowment for
 
the Arts point ; view,  it is always a privile ge and a pleasure
 
to welcome our finest Folk Artists from all over the country
 
representing from so many of the different roots of America
 
because it's really at this time every year certainly when I get
 
an impression again or a renewed confirmation of what I strongly
 
believe which is that what makes the United States of America a"
 
particular a unique country is the fact that our cultures is
 
based on the many different strains that came from many
 
different mi
.grationSof peoples with the
- cultures who
 
encountered other cultures here of those who were here first) of
 
others who came later and out of all of this came the cultures
 
)
 
that you represent and the cultures that we at the National
 
Endowment for the Ar; try to help,  so this is a particularly
 
important occasion I think in the arts of America and all of
 
this wouldn't be possible it weren't for the fact that we at the
 
1
1
.
  
National Endowment draw on your colleagues and peers around the
 
country who know what you do and what your colleagues in'
 rder to
 
give what Bess said she wanted you to do as I know you will do,
 
is to continue to provide us with the best advice that you can
 
as to what we should do next to spend the taxjpayer's dollars
 
your dollars / to help you
 
and a guy who from really the beginning
 
I- ,
 
of the Folk Arts Program has been a part of that aaf
t providing
 
that advice )the Chairman of our Folk Arts Panel Bill Ivey is
 
here with us tonight and I can't think of anybody better to
 
follow my little act, to create another act tonight than Bill
 
Ivey,  so I wonder if I could present to you the Chairman of our
 
panel.
 
MR.  IVEY:
 
I thought all day off and on about what I might say to you
 
tonight.
 I don't have all my ideas entirely organized but there
 
are two or three things I
'd like to comment on.
 First of all I
 
want say a very, very specific thank you to someone whose
 
financial support made the events of these two days possible and
 
that of course is Paul Martinson who  
 
I think I should say something to the recipients of our awards
 
here tonight to talk a little bit about what a pleasure it is
 
for those of us who are volunteers and come to Washington to
 
'
To
 
from time to time r
4r  talk about the Folk Arts and debate the
 
I
 
merit proposals and policies in the world of Folk Arts.
 To deal
 
1
-5  
with this process i-
 both pleasant and at times seemingly
 
impossible.
 You know we start with 125 nominees and virtually
 
ever
ne of those nominees is a very, very accomplished and
 
deserving Folk Artist.
 In a sense no competes with the other
 
because each contribution is so special, each region each ethnic
 
group is sufficiently unique.
 So that there really is no way of
 
comparing1 no way of judging and were faced with that task once a
 
year.
 How do you take all of these deserving people and narrow
 
it down to the very, very finest all
 
the contrast that sense of
 
frustration with the pleasure that comes w4-th to the panel when
 
we finally arrive at the final recipients because I would assure
 
you that just as frustrated as we are, we are absolutely
 
thrilled,  absolutely thrilled when we come to the conclusion We
 
actually see the final list of name $nd realizes just how
 
deserving, how special, how outstanding each of you is.
 So you
 
need to understand that this is a very, very pleasant process
 
for us, tho at times difficult.
 The Endowment has many
 
components.
 I represent one,  I am the Chairman of the panel and
 
that panel comes together a few times a year to
 
discuss  
 Folk Arts.
 I guess the final thought and
 
this may be a third thought that I will leave with you,  it's
 
just how important your staff is,  I
've said this at other times
 
and I
'm always willing to say it again.
 You can have advice and
 
councils from volunteers, people can come from around the
 
country, we have experts and
 But there is
 
A
 
I
 
really no substitution for ongoing interest commitment of the
 
1
iVf
r
 
people who give there days and their lives to the Folk Arts and
 
to the Endowment.
 So I think those of you who are Heritage
 
Awards recipients and I need to help me or charter me in
 
acknowledging the contributions to Bess Hawes,  and Dan Sheehy,
 
oo 
f
i
g
 
Barry Bergey, Pat Sanders, Pat Makell, the entire staff of the
 
Folk Arts Program did such a terrific job of everyday going in
 
and dealing with the issues facing Folk Arts 
)handling those 350
 
applications that come in every year and making sure that
 
everyone get the tender loving care i
.
-t '
deserve .  so I will
 
close, well I
'll say one thing afterwards,  I
'll close by asking
 
you and I
'll start with asking the Heritage Awards recipients to
 
give a round of applause to our very dedicated staff.
 Please do.

STUDS NIMROD
. ???:
 
Well it's nice to be here,  I see a lot of faces here that I know
 
especially /Lf t1 tYback here I learned to like him and his
 
wife Kate
 41  whole lot and I think a lot of him and all
 
the people  
 I love to be with them,  I
 
love to sing with them.
 I
'm going to do you a song  
 
good friend of mine, this is an old timey christian song, got
 
one record that's what I
'm going to sing it and a lot of
 
coalminer songs if anybody just wants it can go over there and
 
get it,  
 
It's an old song this is a woman that
 
was talkin about  
 why I got interested in it that's
 
the reason I
'm going to sing this.
 You could put it off to long
 
it's talkin about the Lord you know,  and what the Lord says
 
about things, this woman she been taught by her parents,  she
 
just  /
  off a little to late to play.
 This song
 
goes down to she was awarning the young people all about it.
 
STUBS sings a song.
 
That's a warning song.
  
 song about the young
 
people ain't never hear it you know, but I remember back years
 
and years and years ago, me and my mother wrote one back years
 
ago before Jesus went on the mountain with three disciples.
 It
 
61
 
 
was brought to me when I went down to pray, the third time he
 
said sleep on  
 enemy.
 I wrote a song about
 
some hits to that record I  
,
 before Jesus had circled
 
all of this you know,  I sang it

 STUDS sings a song.
 
I think it's very appropriate that Nimrod speaks for all twelve
 
r 7
 
of his colleagues here just a very simple s
-t-at
-4sties.
 Nimrod is
 
91 years old meaning he carries a century minus 9 years and what
 
Bess was talking about is what this is all about, continuity.
 
Sense of history,  sense of past and when Bess was speaking of
 
her legend, her fable the image of that person at the top of the
 
stairs in that castle carrying on all those before.
 We have a
 
certain moment in history when the younger apparently have lost
 
a sense of history for one reason or another.
 And that's why
 
this particular gathering tomorrow night is a tribute to all
 
twelve.
 Can't name them all now but you'll meet them tomorrow

 COMMENT:
 Can't top that.
 
MR.  BENNETT:
 
I
'm thrilled to be here,  I never had a thrill so great,\on
 
January 2nd of this year, when I got a phone call from Ms. Hawes
 
telling me that I had won this National Heritage Award.
 I
'm
 
just a little old country boy from southern Kentucky, wore
 
overalls to church, barefooted to church, barefooted to school,
 
I
 
and when I left my home in Kentucky I
 -
w
. ote,' about a week before
 
I left I didn't have a dress rode I was nineteen
 I rode a mule
 
twenty miles to a second hand clot
,hing store and I brought me a
 
• /
 
coat for a dollar and that's way ,I got to Annapolis.
 I had
 
twenty dollars when I left my home in Kentucky and when I got to
 
Annapó
- is I had four dollars, well I beg your pardon I had
 
eleven dollars at that time and I paid seven dollars for a room
 
rent,  room and board for seven dollars a week,  and fortunately I
 
got a job the next day,  I just had four dollars left and
 
fortunately I got a job the next morning.
 For 45 years I
've
 
changed jobs a few times but each time it was for the better and
 
was never without a job all that time I retired 16 years ago and
 
have a lovely family, a wife Dorothy  
,
 my son and a
 
granddaughter Marcie,  so it's nice,  I
'm just thrilled to death
 
to meet all of you people, your're so wonderful.
 I wish I had

MORRIS
 
Good evening everybody.  I am proud to be here to say a few words
 
about what I think.
 I am glad to honor my partner from
 
Louisiana  
 
Here he is sitting
 
right here, him, my mother and two of my brothers on the side
 
sitting right there.
 I am glad to be here.
 Now he can speak
 
English but mostly he speaks French all the time.
 A lot of time
 
some of the people don't understand his language cause he speaks
 
half english and half french which my language is almost like
 
his but most of the people understand what I
'm talking about.
 
But I
'm glad to be here to transport him.
 I am glad I am one of
 
his first kids, he is the father of fourteen kids,  five sons and
 
nine girls but I great to see this much he's still here and
 
happy out of his whole family he lost one of his Sons SO  he's
 
left with four sons and still nine girls which his family will
 
be a while before it run out.
 And maybe I shouldn't say this
 
but like they say in history father like sons,  all daughters
 
like mommas or something whatever but myself I
'm one of the
 
oldest his first one,  I guess you can say his first and hers
 
anyway I
'm just the first one out of the family out of them
 
two.
 I have ten kids of my own,  I think I
'm the one that's
 
clos& to him than the rest of the kids, which is to me,  like I
 
always did say it might be a good husband to someone or a good
 
lady to someone, a good lady to some husband, to a good husband
 
to some lady, now I
'm not one of those,  I don't,  it's one of
 
those things,  in each family you have to have that and I am
 
great to be here to express these words that I am proud to my
 
/
 
daddy was sick and my mother (mosoline?) right there.
 I
'm the
 
first one these 14 and I am glad to see that your people enjoy
 
what he did today  
 people.
 He had five boys one them is
 
deceased, but he's got four boys left they all in the racket,
 
those are one of the things, your're either this away or that
 
away, but still it's in that, but we all trying to do what daddy
 
did and were all glad it's a big honor and thrill for us what he
 
did, what he honored today and we will try to keep this
 
traditional going up.
 Thank You.
 I
'm
 
his oldest
 
son and I
'm  
 the brothers they are here,  I got two more
 
brothers here today they nice their sitting at the table with
 
daddy and momma over here,  if they want to speak they are free
 
to do it and I would like to,  I am proud to be here,  If it
 
wouldn't be for them I wouldn't be here in front of you all and
 
I am glad to be here and I hope we can continue to be here.
 
Thank You.
 
MORRIS' youngest brother:
 
I
'm one of  
 sons also,  I
'm the baby boy, Morris is the
 
oldest one and I just come here to get him.
 
(LADY-S eak4ng):
 
Back in his young days he use to come to my house years ago.
 
Mel- you come and got the gentleman my old man probably come and
 
get me.
 He says he feeds me gunpowder that makes me talk so
 
much.
 I would like to all of our  
,
 I think what your're
 
doing is a wonderful thing and this is not just me it's people,
 
it's people it's all of us.
 My dad now you don't mind now I
'm
 
liable to say something that might be censored.
 You don't care
 
do you, that's the point.
 Well you have to listen real careful
 
to get this.
 My dad use to tell the boys and when you were
 
speaking of fourteen there was thirteen of us,  I tried but I
 
just had two, might had been me or my old man I don't know
 
which,  anyhow.
 I feel very humbled to be here and my dad use to
 
tell the boys,  in the mountain 
She
 was a school teacher and then
 
he had a store in a little town and he was one of the first
 
people to come all the way to Baltimore to buy things to go in
 
his store you know what you couldn't get back in the mountains.
 
He use to tell the boys, he said now Nimrod hush, he said if
 
your're going to be a shevier (You understand what I meant,
 
don't you?) be a good one and you'll be a success \and he said
 
that if we don't have a few' 'm- go4ng
 
t
o
 
w
a
itiri  it up to here.
 
I would kie to tell some of the people who helped me to get into
 
the Folklore field,  I
'm 71 two weeks ago, that ain't bad for a
 
old woman I
'm still in pretty good shape,  
d  ain't got
 
nothing on me.
 I would like to tell you   
•

Folk Center
 
at the University of Pennsylvania and of course your own local
 
* '
 
David Whist-net my husband calls him fish and Charlie Camp of the
 
Maryland Council of the Arts and the lady that nobody ever
 
mentions that worked with me for years at the Brandywine Friends
 
of Old Time Music and I know that Bess was telling me about the
 
letters that come in Ellen Hudak of the Brandywine Friends and
 
she has worked the whole time of music, she has worked in this
 
for years.
 I want you to know that I feel humble and I
'm proud
 
of what your're doing I think its great  
 
got  
 today, that's pretty good too.
 I want to thank
 
all of you this is for people and the man up above because
 
without him we wouldn't none be doing nothing and I got joke
 
it
 
before I go,  can I got time to tell it, you don't care do
 
you.
 
It ain't dirty it's just funny, me and my old man,  I mean my
 
husband I want to thank him, he really did let me loose.
 I go
 
to play music and anywhere I wanted to go for the last 50 years
 
and of course he would go along, he was a dry cleaner and then
 
he was an insurance man,  I don't know where he went but he went
 
all the time anyhow.
 We raised a lot of children now you have
 
to l
isten real careful and this ain't going to be dirty when you
 
heze
 I say is true.
 We raised a lot of children coming and
 
4
 
going I don't know where they came from they just come by our
 
house always came in and  
 play music Ralph  r
 use to
 
come up there when he was a boy and we had this young boy who
 
was twelve years old and you know a few years back they started
 
teaching them some things in school you know, the kids
 
questioned so he was twelve and he came home one day and he said
 
all of them, we started sex education today.
 I said okay
 
Jerem y, what did you learn, well he was teaching us the parts of
 
the female and he said if we were embarassed we can go in
 
another room and ask questions and I said Jeremy do you know
 
what sex is?
 I think so and I said that's male and female the
 
way God made us.
 Oh my goodness gracious,  I really made a bad
 
mistake.
 I said what did you do.
 He said we had to fill out a
 
form to describing ourselves.
 Age and I said twelve, color and
 
I said white,  sex and I said NO!

HENRY ??
 
I am Henry ' 
from Louisiana and everywhere we went, people
 
were curious about Louisiana.
 How we learned how to play and
 
1'
 
all of this here and  
 is different but t
Aver us thd4
-ans in
 
Louisiana we always did something every since I was a small boy,
 
you work all the week on the weekends they had a house
 
somewhere and we will go and have fun but all the  
 and
 
songs that you wanted and you were gone to church, they made
 
sure of that regardless of what kind of church you belonged to
 
you were going to church.
 That's the reason I think, they don't
 
understand our way of living from Louisiana, cause a we kind of
 
different from
 ,
 but still in all of occassions it  '
s
 
something they, they sing when they happy, they sing when they
 
sad, they always going to make something up and I remember a few
 
years ago they had rhythm and blues going on.  I went on and got
 
me a string band,  it lasted about six or seven years I guess
 
then when ever them young ones got in the band, when they first
 
learned how to, cause a, any musician that got a group they know
 
that is hard to keep a good group together cause they always got
 
somebody that get very smart you know and first thing so I said
 
to myself,  I said well  
 and we are
 
going to play whenever, cause everybody had a job.
 I can
 
remember back in '
75, they would call  
 and myself the
 
Yank—a-Chank Band, but we kept on playing right on.
 And I
 
remember in 1965,  I believe that's when Ralph  
 came and
 
discovered us.
 We had never heard of a festival, we didn't know
 
what it was and they got  
 and when he said he was
 
from New York I almost went and got my shotgun.
 I didn't know
 
nothing about them people dGw1,  and we started going to
 
places  
 and now I
'm very proud to know that
 
Ralph done got to be a President of the festival and
 
-Wyatt  
 is still recognize us and we got some
 
people that was born and raised right there in Louisiana and
 
they moved to Bement, Texas and would you believe they don't
 
speak French no more.
 And when they got to the place there they
 
couldn't even speak a word in English, so I
'm very proud to see
 
how far we went cause a we done some struggling.
 When I first
 
started playing the fiddla  in  
 my daddy was
 
accordion player but nobody  
 cause a he never did
 
wanted to be caught in nothing, him and  
 are doing they
 
were do the best with the accordion they had but he always did
 
say a when I
'm gone I want,  I don't people to nothing about it,
 
so when your're gone, your're gone and I was born,  accordion in
 
the house, but I didn't want to play that so I started trying to
 
play the fiddlei which was twice fiddler was  
 
RENRY ?  continued-
it sound to, loud.
 Me and another friend of mine we even stole
 
some screen, some wire from a screen door to make us some
 
strings and right now I got a
, when we went to France they heard
 
the story about the screen door wire for a fiddler they didn't
 
believe it.
 So they ask me can you  
"
'
-
 one of them
 
fiddles,  I said no not anymore,  said other than cigar boxes or
 
cardboard now, but they finally got me one anyhow so I made it
 
and I done the whole thing just like I done it when I was small,
 
ka r
 
our -
board wasn't net horse
 it was made out of
 
When you got it in your head you'll make it

I
'm pretty shy,  a fellow come tap me on my shoulders and said
 
you better get up there and say something.
 I tell you it's a/
 
I
'm really grateful that I have this privilege of coming to meet
 
people such as you and all the provisions that you made all the
 
provisions of the Hotel and the Conference room.
 One of the
 
first things that I experienced when I met the people last night
 
was that everyone was jolly and happy and congenial and there's
 
) '
 
no doubtAthat   
 So tonight I
'm really grateful to this
 
organization for making this possible and you play a big part in
 
encouraging our people to be inspired and that there is
 
something or a reward here as we live for the things that we
 
strive to do and I never thought that I
'd be in places such as
 
this 
) I
'm from Oklahoma,  I
'm a full blood Comanche i Not too long
 
ago I was interviewed by the local newspaper there in
 
Oklahoma,  
,
 Oklahoma.
 One of the things that they
 
emphasize on was that there was one day I was laying on my front
 
poach of my home way out in the country by the Wichita mountains
 
and there was an airplane flying by and they said this a little
 
Indian boy was laying there on the poach on his back and looked
 
up in the sky and said I
'll probably never ride one of
 
those
 me and my wife and my children were still at the
 
windows and said WOW I said I don't know what this person wants
 
4
 
out here, nice looking lady in a business suit and about three
 
or four thousand dollars worth of jewelry on and when she come
 
up on the porch and knocked at the door she said I
'm looking for
 
c
_
_
)o_
_
 
'
'
 t  •
'r
 
Da te Niberqua and I
'm interested in some Indian art and so from
 
there on I thought well if a person like this from the other
 
world is interested in me than I think I better do something
 
about it.
 So that more or less inspired me to start my career,
 
as I went along whtlM  
 flute playing was incorporated
 
my art career and when I was a little boy about seven years old
 
was the first time I heard an 1ndian flute and from that time it
 
stuck with me as I grew and when I could hold a conversation
 
with people or relate or communicate with people I began i
-n--part
 
about the Indian flute and unfortunately no one made the indian
 
flute1 no one knew anybody that made or even played it,  so
 
through the fo rties I began to inquire about it, and there's no
 
one who knew anything about it.
 I went to the elders of my
 
tribe and I thought well this is a beautiful flute and there's
 
no one making it today and no one plays it so I begin to wonder
 
about it and when I graduated from high school I still seeked
 
out the history of the Indian flute.
 There was very little
 
wrote about the Indian flute so the people that were interested
 
in my art career I would inquire about and I asked if they would
 
assist me in making a research on about finding more about the
 
flute so this how it all started out by going from reservation
 
to reservation from some of my tribal members and inquiring and
 
asking about the flute and as time went along I began to find
 
A
d
 
people I knew that knew a little bit about the flute and from
 
there on I began to research the flute at the Smithsonian that
 
played a big part in my career, the Library of Congress and the
 
Historical Society of  
 City and this little museum in
 
S
nt Frances, South Dakota where I went up to find some flutes
 
that they had on display.
 Dr. Payne from Oklahoma city he hs
 
about 500 flutes in his collection and the majority of those
 
flutes are collected  r Indian flutes.
 So one thing led to
 
another and I began to  
 while I was just in high school,  I
 
had a flute I found in and old  Qnd-shop the fella that sold me
 
the suitcase that had this jndian flute in there didn't realize
 
what he was selling me,  I bought the whole suitcase for
 
twenty-five dollars and I found this flute in there and I played
 
the flute at times and I took it to'-park& many times to see what
 
it was made out of and learn how to play it.
 So on 1ay I was
 
just playing an art show and a fella come by and I had
 
illustrated a flute player in one of my paintings and he asked
 
me if I knew what I painted and I said yes I painted a flute
 
player and he said what do you know about the flute.
 I said
 
well I got one that I play it and I don't know whether he
 
believed me or not so he stood there and we talked for about
 
three hours about the jndian flute.
 So the next day he come
 
back by and he had four beautiful flutes wrapped in a white
 
clotht and he laid them out in front of me and he said I want
 
you to take your pick, then I said I felt very selfish in doing
 
that because these are very rare and -
the e very beautiful and he
 
said well I like your story about the flute and he said I read
 
about the flute and I tried to discover today the value of it
 
and who makes it and where it comes from, how does it date back,
 
and what is it made out of, why was it played, what tribe played
 
it,  is all the flutes the same, what's the construction of it,
 
is this the real thing, why does it sound the flute sound in
 
4
 this particular fashion.
 All of these and he said I liked your
 
story the best so I want you take one of these, so I got the
 
flute then I took my painting down and gave it to him so this is
 
where it all started from.
 Making a research on the flute and I
 
end up here with some wonderful people and I
'm grateful to be a
 
part of this great United States where people still recognize
 
that there are people out there sometimes not recognizing there
 
own communion but recognized by great people like you here in
 
our Capital and everytime I see the Capitol building in whatever
 
direction it's in it just kind of does something to you, you
 
know there's people there that are concerned about people like
 
me and the rest of my people here so I thank you and may the
 
good Lord bless you.
 One of the greatest persons that I ever
 
met was the Master Painter and he's one that taught me all of
 
this and the Master Flute Player that produces all the music and
 
that's God and I
'm grateful to be here.
 This lady here please
 
stand Charlotte,  she the lady that nominated me for the award
 
and I
'm so grateful to her and my wife I want her to stand up
 
also.
 
SONYA DØUNCHS:
 
I
'm Sonya Dounchs and I
'm from a little town in b e ward Kansas
 
(1
 
way in the Northwest corner and I
, very honored to be here
 
amongst all you wonderful people.
 This is quite an honor for
 
me, I-
 about six years ago I received a telephone call from a
 
lady in Manhattan, Kansas and she said I understand that you do
 
tatting,  and I said no, my grandmother tatted but I never did
 
learn  I said I do bobbin lace making and she didn't say
 
,
  
anything for a long time and I thought my la
 what had I said
 
you know  finally she said you do what, and I said I do bobbin
 
lace making.
 She said may I come out and interview you,
 es
 
that would be fine.
 So she came to Atwood, which is clear
 
across the state and I think she got there about 7
:00 that one
 
evening and she left about 1
:30 in the morning, we found out
 
that we had a lot to talk about and that's the lady who
 
nominated me for the award, Jenny Ch4nn  I have met so many
 
wonderful people through her and you folks to now I also my
 
husband's with me Don, he makes all my bobbins, which I think
 
it's about up to four hundred now.
 I brought one pa41 with me
 
that's why I
'm so nervous, when I talk to people,  I
'm making
 
lace,  I
'm keeping my hands busy.
 My brother-in-law and
 
sister-in-law also came with me they live just 30 miles south of
 
Atwood and we've had a wonderful time and thank you all so much.
 
Good evening.
 I
'm really nervous.
 I like to congratulate my
 
father for receiving the Heritage Award for
 I
 
also would like to thank him for all of the knowledge and common
 
sense and all of the musical experience that I gained through
 
him and I thank you very much for all that and thank you all.
 I
 
guess that's it.
 
Well,  I
'm really glad to be here to be one to receive this
 
Heritage Award,  I didn't think it would ever happen, well I call
 
myself a bum, being a working man and receiving such an award as
 
this nobody knows how good it makes me feel and how proud I am
 
to be the one to  wee it and I want to thank the half of
 
everybody over the year for being so good to me especially Ralph
 
a za and all of this staff, this dear lady here and to all of
 
you.
 I
'm just really a wonder and such a pleasure to be with
 
the other people that received it and then I want to thank
 
Shelton  
 for the one being able to discover me and
 
if it hadn't been for him I don't reckin I
'll ever play the
 
guitar again and so I sorry I got such a poor speech in which I
 
don't read and write and I hope you all bear with me and please
 
Ah-
excuse me for laughing which is nobody's own fault by me not
 
reading and writing,  it's my fault about schools and all, but I
 
just didn't go.
 I did,  I keeps working instead of going to
 
school, so I really just don't know how to thank everybody and
 
just being able to be one person who grew up to be able to
 
receive this award,  it's such a great pleasure and thank you all
 
ever so much and thank everybody.

Hi.
 I
'm only going to say a few more words.
 I
'm still
 
Al
 
T
h
  
son.
 The one that got the other
 
earlier,  I
'm the baby and I just like to say that it's a real
 
pleasure for all of us to be here and you'all helped us out a
 
lot but a lot of people that helped us and I
'll only name one
 
for right now cause like that guy said I am nervous but for
 
right now I would like to bring Nick up here he can explain it a
 
lot for our Heritage
 
NICK:
 
Well I saw  
 giving me the eye,  so I figured when Ms.
 
Marceline was here I figured I
'd better go up and do my duty.
 
First I
'd like to say,  I
'd like to thank the  
 Family
 
for discovering me for helping me to discover myself because a
 
really there's a whole another side to it deciding to be
 
folklore/ you have to be inspired by some people t
-ha
-t--make some
 
that make great folk culture and certainly everyone here is
 
getting a Heritage Award would be in that category.
 I haven't
 
had a chance to say hello to Ola Belle Reed yet though I see her
 
there, now she probably remembers who I am.
 Ola Belle has
 
trained I think two generations not just Ola Belle but her whole
 
family, Bud and David.
 She's trained about two generations of
 
University of Pennsylvania folklore students who are sent out to
 
d
 
collect bal-l
-ots and a I was one of her early students or middle
 
students am not quite sure which class I graduated in
 (she
 
said '
73)  
that's right there you go and when I was there
 
she told me how she taught Henry Glass, too, you know so I want
 
to thank Ola Belle and I want to especially thank the  
 
family who / I
- got a
,  I was able to spend more time studying with
 
and thank them for helping me get along here and I
'm sorry I
'm
 
not in Louisiana sometime because I miss folks like them but I
'm
 
also very glad to be here in Washington that's part of the other
 
side of the stories that we "Ve all students of these folks too
 
and I want to thank them for letting us study with them.
 
You know what we've been talking about is that we
're a country of
 
people who care about tradition and we haven't said from this
 
platform tonight that one of the most important forces and
 
traditions of our country h
e been the force of the family and
 
this weekend on the National Mall if your're around Saturday and
 
Sunday if you stay over a bit there's going to be a Black Family
 
Reunion sponsored by the National Council of Negro Women for
 
it's 50th  Anniversary paying tribute to the the family and
 
power in this case of the Black family to hold together this
 
spirit and the culture and the belief of people against an awful
 
lot of adversity over a few centuries struggling in this
 
country.
 So it's something that you might want to tuhe into if
 
your're in town tomorrow, Saturday and Sunday I mean.
 But one
 
of the most powerful families along with those families that
 
everyone of you heard as the word recipients come from because
 
you really are here because you 're representing a family in the
 
community and one of those powerful families ,Bess'  family.
 Some
 
of us/ you  look Bess in the eye and you know she comes from a
 
powerful family.
 She's got that deep spirit and that love and
 
that poetry and that ability to look at anybody and really know
 
where they come from and they can feel good about it and her Dad
 
and her Mother went out in the field,  father I think it was in
 
1909 after he'd been studying with George Limon Kettridge at
 
Harvard
 ,
Went and published one of the first books of the
 
American cowboy songs when it wasn't stylish in the publishing
 
books in writteti class people in this country and he went on to
 
do a great deal more John Lomax and his wife traveling with him
 
working together and keeping alive some of the most beautiful
 
traditions in this country that ever had to offer and then her
 
brother Allen at the age of, barely at the age of twenty I think
 
was out in the field on his own in the 1933 was his first year
 
'
1 44  
out alone,  recording for the Archived a d- Folk songs at the
 
Library of Congress.
 Everything that they recorded they
 
p
1
 
struggled to get it in print and on record
ot to put it on the
 
shelf and not to put it away in a cabinet somewhere, but to make
 
sure it only went out to people who never heard it before, back
 
to the communities where they recorded it so that the people
 
would understand that someone who came through there and was
 
moved by the generousity of people like your2selves to give them
 
some of those beautiful things that they liked, could be
 
appreciated enough to have someone go away and come back and
 
send you your song or your poem or your words in another for
 
written down in music, written down in printed page so that
 
would understand and all the rest of
orld who could get a hold
 
of that book would understand the genius of the family
 :
 
come from and the people that you come from, the place
 
come from and the genius that you as people are.
 So I
've alw y:
 
been very grateful to the Lomax's for having done that and I
 
don't think that many of us would be in this room if John Lomax
 
and son E44.i t and Bess hadn't struggled a great deal,  some of
 
the bureaucratics, some of them financial,  some of them
 
intellecutal at times and the
'still struggling, there still
 
struggling to get the stuff available and around and we've got
 
to be grateful to people like you and people like to the Lomax'
 
and people like Frank Hodsoll for understanding that it's not
 
only the music, the poetry and the crafts that make it into
 
department stores or on record shelves that are important it's
 
the stuff that lies behind it.  Not only the stuff that's
 
commercially available all the time in this Republic of Commerce
 
that we celebrate as a great nation, but it's who you are and
 
all of the people who no one has ever heard of like your selves
 
1
 
who carry traditions that go back hundreds )sometimes thousands
 
of years and love them enough to keep them alive and bring them
 
to city like this that seems not to care, but when we come
 
together in a room like this you really realize that we do care,
 
IC
 
and we love you for what you've kept going and where waiting for
 
for you to try and keep it going and we thank you for coming and
 
thank you for hearing me out.
 
BESS ???:
 
I guess there's not anything else to say except Good Night and
 
God Bless You and we'll see you tomorrow evening at the
 
beautiful concert when we'll see all this beautiful art
 
displayed at the Lisner Auditorium for so many people to come
 
and enjoy it with us so see you tomorrow evening Good Night and
 
Thank You.
 There is a kind of a black leather purse that's been
 
left out there outside that we're worried about
,
oes it belong
 
to somebody here?  What does it look like?
 It's a big black
 
leather purse,  if it belong to anybody please come and tell us.

The feasibility study we commissioned has been turned in.
 I attach a copy,

 In the meantime,
 
although I think you would find the entire report both readable and entertaining,
 
the meat of the matter is contained on pages 30-39.
 I
've had some interesting
 
conversations with the Southern Arts Federation on the entire issue and would
 
appreciate the benefit of your advice on how to proceed further.

 1986 Heritage Ceremony.
 
The Martinson Foundation has advised us that they intend to provide us with
 
$5,000 during FY 86 to support the banquet and the Congressional reception.
 
I should like your views on the following:
 
a)  Can we continue to count on an additional $50,000 from
 
the Chairman's Reserve or should we seek outside corporate support for that
 
figure?  Or would you think there might be some political advantage in writing
 
this into the agency budget as a discrete item and having it be something
 
that Congress formally approves (or doesn't?) every year?  I
've always felt, as
 
you know, that Heritage is something that Congress itself can be truly and
 
constructively involved with.  And, there is something that feels to me politically
 
and tactically wrong with corporate funding for a national honor, but maybe that's
 
my old-fashioned style.
 
b)
 Shall we plan generally to continue the pattern of last
 
year -
-
awards given at reception in Senate Hearing Room, banquet at National
 
Press Club, concert at Ford's Theatre?  Most people seemed to like it.
 If
 
you agree as well, then should we go ahead and contact Frankie Hewitt about
 
reserving the theatre, or do you want to handle it differently in view of
 
Ford's not receiving a Challenge grant?

Dear Bill,
 
I really do apologize for waiting so long to write you a note thanking you
 
for your warm hospitality during my recent trip to your beautiful state.
 
You were a most kind and cordial host during the East West Center day -
 
and then to have that gorgeous lei waiting for me at the Merrie Monarch
 
Festival was really an unexpected treat.  Noe No. and Kaul Zuttermeister
 
had kept your let in a box with some damp paper towels and some especial
 
traditional magic as well I think, because it was just as fresh as it could
 
possibly be when I picked it up, and I wore it to great effect not only at
 
the final concert but all the way home on the airplane the following day!
 
It was a generous thought, and I so appreciated it.
 
Then I was also pleased to get the copy of the tape.  It is a little low-key
 
but I can hear it well enough and am about half-way through transcribing it.
 
Thanks again for your prompt help.
 
Now as to your requests, my daughter finally located the enclosed report on
 
the project I mentioned during my East West Center talk.  Apparently i
t
 
has not been published, but I think if you wanted to cite it in some
 
permanent form you could always get in touch with the two authors through
 
the Anthropology Department at the University of Massachusetts, Boston
 
campus.  My daughter, Naomi Hawes Bishop, is Department Chairman for this
 
year and would be happy to help.  She will be doing field work in Nepal
 
during the coming summer but will be back at her teaching chores around
 
Labor Day.
 
The National Folk Festival will this year be held in New York in connection
 
with the Statue of Liberty celebration, during the weekend of July fourth
 
(
7/4,5,6).  Joe Wilson is still the director, but his organization, the
 
National Council for the Traditional Arts has moved to 806  15th Stteet NW,
 
Washington, DC  20005.  Their new phone is 202/639-8370.  I
've not seen any
 
printed material on the National Festival yet; as soon as I do, I
'll be glad
 
to stick a flyer in an envelope for you.  The Smithsonian Festival of
 
American Folkilfe, by the way, will be on during the same time period;  in
 
this case, June 25-29 and July 2-7.  Tennessee is the featured state for
 
this year, and Japan the invited country.  Perhaps you could get to both
 
New York and Washington!  The Smithsonian also has not gotten any printed
 
-2 --
material out that I know of.  I
'll be glad to send their announcement along
 
when I receive it here.
 
Again, my warm appreciation for your hospitality.
 
come back to Rawaii and to see so many old friends
 
to Lynn, Bernie  Mary Bitterinan and any others you
 
Cordially,
 
Bess Lomax Hawes
 
Director

folk arts people who gathered here with you last month,
 
I wish to say thank you for a very stimulating talk.
 
It was splendid and just what we had in mind for this
 
group of people.
 
I hope that you had a chance to enjoy the Merrie Monarch,
 
and to relax a bit while you were in Hawaii.
 That was quite
 
a storm!
 
I enclose a tape copy of your talk and the discussion,  but
 
I' m afraid it's recorded at a pretty low audio level.
 
When you get a chance,  do try to find that bibliographic
 
reference for me.
 Also,  by any chance,  do you have any
 
information,  a flyer or prospectus,  for the upcoming
 
National Folk Festival.
 Should I write to the National
 
Council?
 Is Joe Wilson still the director?
 
Hope our paths cross again soon.
 Let me know if you need
 
anything from here.
 
Aloha and best wishes,

SUBJECT:
 FY 86 Program Funds
 
At our panel meeting in June 1986, which served as our final meeting
 
committing FY 86 funds, the Panel elected to dip into our 1987 money
 
to the tune of approximately $106,000 for 5 grants that they felt
 
were exceptionally worthy.  (
I've attached a diecription of the grants.)
 
As you know, our budget is small and while I don't like to cry "poor
 
mouth," I
'm not totally averse to it either.  As you begin to look at
 
year and figures and any remaining PY 86 program monies, I would like
 
to make a special plea for Folk Arts.  Converting the 5 grants back to
 
86 grants would simply be a matter of in-house paperwork, the Panel would
 
be delighted, the field of folk arts would be advanced, and the Folk Arts
 
Program could begin the year in the black!
 
Do keep is in mind....

SUBJECT:
 Question of Conflict-of-Interest
 
Jane Delgado, Executive Director of the Association of Hispanic Arts
 
in New York City, has asked that I attend a planning meeting in New
 
York City on February 2
7.  The purpose of the meeting is to plan future
 
Hispanic f
olk arts progra ming under the aegis of ARk, and I an being
 
invited as a source of information concerning Hispanic folk arts and
 
event planning.  Other folk art experts are attending as well.
 
ARk is an Endowment grantee and is aware of the conflict-of-interest
 
rules t
hat prevent their subsidizing my trip to New York.  The Avon
 
Foundation, Avon's corporate contributions component, has in t
he pe
st
 
several years become increasingly involved in funding cultural and
 
human services activities in the Hispanic communities of the U.S.  The
 
director, Mr. Glen Clark, has offered to pick up the expenses for my
 
trip to New York -
 travel expenses only, no honorarium.  The Foundation
 
is interested in seeing programs develop at ABA that they would be
 
willing to fund.  This i
s their stated interest in including me.
 
My questionsis, of course, is this allowable under current Endowment
 
regulations and policy?
 
Thank you for your assistance.

Subject:  Our far-flung constituents
 
In FY 84 the Folk Arts Program of the Endowment helped mount a series of
 
workshops on the island of Palau in which master carvers instructed
 
younger men and women in the uniquely Palauan art of story-board -
 
carved and painted bas reliefs representing episodes from Pelaoan mythology.
 
The amount involved was $29,000.
 (
I can, of course, provide full information
 
on the grant and its sequels if you're interested.)
 
The first class of young carvers was just graduated at a formal ceremony
 
where they were addressed by the President of Palau who made such a
 
remarkably cogent speech concerning art and progress, (
as reported by the
 
Palauan Gazette) I thought you might find it interesting and even possibly
 
quotable.

Subject:
 Folk Arts and the Crafts
 
The purpose of this memorandum is to update you on several events and activities
 
in the folk arts world that individually didn't seem to amount to much but that
 
collectively are beginning to suggest a possible new area of concern for the
 
Folk Arts Program.
 
1
) Several years ago, Congressman Yates requested the Office of
 
Technology Assessment to produce a study on the effect of technological
 
developments on handcrafts that depend upon the use of "renewable resources"
 
(non-manufactured materials -- reeds, clays, wood, etc.).  I believe the
 
project stemmed from Mr. Yates' long-standing interest in American Indian
 
affairs.  In the course of the OTA study, a conference of interested federal
 
offices was called and former staffer Bob Teske attended, representing the
 
Folk Arts Program.  Eventually a report was issued:
 "Technology, Renewable
 
Resources and American Crafts."  A copy is attached for your interest.
 
2
) Last year, Meriwether Wilson, director of the OTA study, phoned to
 
say a new study was being planned to consider the interaction in both the
 
Pacific and the Caribbean of economic development, ecological impact, renewable
 
resources and tourism.  She invited Folk Arts to comment specifically on the
 
effect of such factors on traditional crafts.  Dan Sheehy wrote an interesting
 
piece on the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico (
attached) and, via Bernie Lopez,
 
a Micronesian graduate student at the University of Hawaii wrote an extremely
 
lengthy but very thorough and well done study of the situation in the Pacific.
 
The OTA has since circulated a preliminary draft of their overall study boiling
 
down our contributions a bit brutally, I thought-
, there are, I suppose, other
 
issues that have to be gotten in there.  The final OTA study is not yet in prin i
 
3
) Meanwhile the Folk Arts Program called a working conference in August
 
1986 on the topic of "Traditional Crafts and Public Funding Policies" that was
 
attended by a number of the State Folk Arts Coordinators as well as by repre-
sentatives of the Smithsonian, the Library of Congress' American Folklife Center,
 
the Indian Arts and Crafts Board (Department of the Interior) and OTA.  I attach
 
a report of this conference for which credit is due to the diligence and editorial
 
competence of Folk Arts staffer, Barry Bergey, aided by our current Fellow, Erin
 
Younger, a lady of exceptional abilities.  It's a lengthy document because it
 
attempts to sum up the disparate points of view of a large number of participants
 
-2 -
and is intended to serve as a stimulus for further discussion and experimentation
 
rather than to arrive at a set of final solutions.  The conversation that occurred
 
during the two days of the conference is well summed up in the first 14 pages.
 
Copies of the entire document are being sent to  all the participants, all State
 
Arts Agencies and the Regional Representatives.
 
4
) Finally, during my October site visit to South Carolina, the Afro-
American basketmakers I spoke with in Charleston mentioned their problem of
 
ever-decreasing access to stands of sweet grasses that grow only along the coast,
 
an area of rapid development.  Their expressed concerns led to the suggestion
 
that a state-wide conference might be an appropriate approach to the issue, since
 
the baskets themselves are of real economic and cultural significance in the area.
 
(
Cf. attached catalogue of a Folk Arts funded exhibit at the McKissick Museum in
 
Charlotte.)  A conference is right now in the very early and very delicate planning
 
stages, but it will undoubtedly have to include representatives from the National
 
Park Service (which owns a good bit of coastal land) as well as State of South
 
Carolina development, park and recreation, and arts interests.  Such an approach
 
could well serve as a model attempt to address an issue before it gets out of
 
hand rather than after; as of yet, nobody is mad at anybody, but they will be
 
pretty soon.  Please keep the above information confidential while Gary Stanton,
 
S
.C. Folk Arts Coordinator, gets his ducks in line; it's a situation that requires
 
a lot of tact (
of which Gary has buckets) to make sure everybody is brought in
 
at the right time and in the right roles.
 
All the above information taken together suggests the eventual development of a
 
new focus for Folk Arts planning in relation to traditional crafts.  I
'm not
 
really clear as yet just what shape this new focus might take, but we must
 
somehow address the fact that environmental and cultural preservation issues are
 
intersecting in several complex ways in lots of places out there right now.  I
 
shall try to amend the Five Year Plan to include a reference to this phenomenon;
 
in the meantime, I wanted you to know what's in the wind and apologize for the
 
inordinate length of this memo.

The comment on page 24 of the Apprenticeship meeting report refers to the use of
 
media outlets in attempting to publicize new
,. statewide apprenticeship programs
 
before anybody has had a chance to find out what they are.  Blanketing the media
 
with press releases announcing the onset of such a program generates mostly
 
responses from hobby crafters and studio craftspeople rather than from traditional
 
artists.  The general experience has been that old-fashioned field work and
 
networking are the best ways of getting a traditional arts apprenticeship
 
program started on the right foot.
 
Subsequently, however, apprenticeship programs seem to yield excellent feature
 
articles and television spots; those themselves are very effective means of
 
reaching traditional artists and traditional communities, and from there on,
 
the problem takes care of itself.

HODSOLL :
 Welcome.  My name is Frank Hodsoll, and I am the Chairman of
 
.
 
the National Endowment for the Arts.  This is the sixth occasion
 
on which the Endowment, through its Folk Arts Program, has
 
celebrated in public some of the extraordinary achievements of
 
t
he traditional folk artists and artisans of the United S
tates.
 
The liveliness, the creativity, and the aesthetic authority of
 
the art forms and artists within our varied nation never ceases
 
to amaze us, and we are deeply proud that our agency, the National
 
Endowment for the Arts can serve to help make our fellow citizens
 
aware of the multiple artistic treasures that bloom across our
 
t
s(sI$IIIS !..
 
-2 --
faculty positions to the Department of French and Francophone
 
' I 
Studies -
-
 specifically, Mr. Dewey Balfa (
the dean of Cajun
 
fiddling) was named Adjunct Professor of Cajun Music and Mr.
 
Canray Fontenot (
the brilliant Black Creole fiddler) has been
 
appointed Adjunct Professor of Creole Music.  Both Mr. Balfa
 
and Mr. Fontenot earned National Heritage Fellowships -
-
 Mr.
 
Balfa in 1982 while Mr. Fontenot received his on this very stage
 
just a year ago.  We congratulate the University of Southwestern
 
Louisiana on their vision, their courage, and their clear-sighted
 
concern for the arts.
 
At this time, too, I should like to recognize
 
(introduces guests)
 
who are with us this evening.
 
And now it is my honor and privilege to introduce the winners
 
of the National Heritage Fellowships for the year of 1987.
 
Each honoree will stand as I read his or her name, and I will
 
ask you to hold your applause until all are standing.  The
 
honorees will then leave the stage go to their seats in the
 
audience and enjoy each others' performances, but don't worry,
 
you will see each one of them again during the course of our concert.

HODSOLL
 I
'm happy to say to you that my official part of the evening
 
is just about over, that in a few minutes I can follow the
 
Heritage Award Fellows back into the audience and settle down
 
to enjoy my evening along with you.
 But first I have the happy
 
responsibility of introducing our mistress of ceremonies for
 
for this evening.
 She is and old friend to many of us here
 
where she has worked with Howard University television station
 
W
fL
IT
I and made appearances in many theaters and television
 
productions.
 She is an actress of power and range,  from her
 
Obie-winning performance in Athol Fugard's Boesman and Lena
 
to appearances as Katherine in the Taming of the Shrew and
 
Cordelia in King Lear for the New York Shakespeare Festivals.
 
Television fans will remember her recent PBS Special produced
 
with her husband, Ossie Davis:  Martin Luther King:
 The Dream
 
and the Drum; her remarkable performance as Mary Tyrone in O
'Neill's
 
Long Day's Journey Into Night, her roles in Roots and I Know
  
Why the Caged Bird Sings; and so many others.
 She is a writer
 
as well:  her newest book, My One Good Nerve, a compilation of
 
her short stories, humour and poetry is just off the press.
 
-2 -
Most of all, many of us here will remember her from the critically
 
acclaimed PBS Series, With Ossie and Ruby -
-
 now in its third
 
season.  And that is the hat, of her extensive wardrobe of
 
chapeaus, that the Endowment has asked her to put on for the
 
evening -
-
 that of welcoming and stimulating hostess, the person
 
who can take us into new experiences and show us how to appreciate
 
them better.
 I am delighted that she has consented to be with
 
us this evening -
-
 may I present the eminent actress, Ruby Dee.
 
RUBY DEE
 Thank you, Frank.
 I should like to say first of all that i
t's a
 
joy to be here.  And i
t's a special joy to be participating in
 
an event that simply and quietly and by its very being puts away
 
forever the old theory that the United States is a melting pot.
 
It's time to get that tired notion behind us for good.  After
 
all, just which pilgrims, which pioneers, which enslaved peoples,
 
which immigrants ever set foot on these shores to the accompaniment
 
of ringing pronouncements that they had come all this long weary
 
way to melt! No,  those people said things about liberty, about
 
freedom, about equality, and about justice.  They were not fading
 
flowers -
-
 they stood out.  They put their visions -
 right and wrong - 
-3
 
out in the open.  And here on this stage we have just seen a
 
triumphant assemblage of some of the results of this long-
standing policy of not melting -
-
 an amazing group of separate
 
and distinctive artists from all across the nation, each one
 
making vividly plain through their art and through their artistry
 
their personal determination to preserve and extend the special
 
beauties of their own special cultural background -
-
 each one
 
showing a different vision of the potential of humankind.
 
I can't wait to get to know them better, to hear a little of
 
their music and see a few of the beautiful things they have made
 
with their hands and hearts, to listen to what they have to say.
 
So let us begin.
 
TUDDY MONTANA
 
RUBY DEE
 The Black people of New Orleans long ago began their own
 
F 
independent celebration of Fat Tuesday -
-
 or Mardi Gras.
 
Block, ward and parish committees formed as long as a century
 
ago took mythic A
merican Indian figures, rather than Greek
 
gods and goddesses, as their dramatic inspiration for costuming
 
and floats.  A hundred years ago, as today, the legendary figure
 
of the Indian chief can be seen to stand for independence,
 
cultural distinctiveness and resistance to conquest -
-
 themes
 
that made for exciting dramas of exploration and battle and
 
conflict as the tribes marched through New Orleans garbed in
 
ever more fantastical and imaginative costumes.  Generations
 
of Black New Orleans Creoles have grown up planning their entire
 
year around the glamorous and exacting requirements of membership
 
and participation in their chosen society or tribe.  Mr. Allison
 
Montana, called (Toody) by his friends, is celebrating his 40th
 
year as Big Chief of the Yellow Pocahontas Tribe -
-
 one of the
 
most venerable and prestigious of these Black New Orleans
 
societies.
 Because this is his final year of leadership, he
 
TUDDY MONTANA. (continued)
 
RUBY DEE
 will appear dressed entirely in white, followed by two of his
 
supporters, his brother, Mr. Edward Montana and Mr. Charles
 
Robertson.
 The costumes they will appear in are entirely
 
designed and handmade by themselves; the music and songs they
 
parade to are particular to their group and represent the
 
Black Creole New Orleans contribution to the larger Afro-Caribbean
 
style of ritual celebration.
 I am proud to present to you -
-
CHIEF ALLISON MONTANA of New Orleans.
 
EVA CASTELLANOZ
 
RUBY DEE
 Now I
'm going to go to another section of the stage in order
 
to have a chat with our next honoree.  GOES TO CRAFTS SECTION
 
She is a craftswoman from the small town of Nyssa on the border
 
between South-eastern Oregon and south-western Idaho.
 Senora
 
Genoveva Castellanoz practices a delicate art, the construction
 
of individually designed coronas -
-
 or flower crowns -
-
 for
 
young ladies celebrating their fifteenth birthday (
a rite of
 
passage in the Mexican-American community similar to a coming
 
out party) or for brides on their wedding day.  These wreaths
 
are of great personal significance.  Household materials such
 
as candle tallow and ordinary white paper are transformed by
 
Senora Castellanoz'  skill and wisdom into objects of true
 
elegance, visions of purity and grace that can be treasured
 
for a lifetime.  Please welcome -

 SENORA GENOVEVA CASTELLANOZ.
 
GENOVEVA CASTELLANOZ ENTERS, SITS DOWN WITH RUBY, BOTH TURNED SO THEY CAN SEE
 
THE SCREEN AT STAGE REAR WHERE SLIDES OF THE CORONAS WILL APPEAR.
 
Questions that might be posed Mrs. Castellanoz:
 
Is there a difference between a corona that you might make
 
a 15 year old and for a bride?
 
EVA CASTELLANOZ (

RUBY DEE
 
Questions that might be posed Mrs. Castellanoz (
continued):
 
Do the different flowers have different meanings?  Do
 
you explain this or discuss it with the young lady?
 
Does the corona custom itself have a special meaning?  Ho
 
do you explain this to the young lady?
 
Do you know other corona makers?  Have you instructed
 
anyone in your art?
 
Is there something special you might want to say about your
 
art and its meaning and why you continue to practice it?
 
BROWNIE FORD
 
RUBY DEE
 Many times this evening you will hear me speak of the fact
 
that much American folk art has resulted from the combination
 
-
-
 one might almost say, the collision -
-
 of many different
 
cultural traditions that met and shook hands and arm wrestled
 
and fought and borrowed and built and destroyed.  Our next
 
honoree demonstates this within his own person -
-
 half Indian,
 
half cowboy, his Comanche and Anglo-Irish parentage link him
 
into the enormously complicated history of the western states
 
where Indians, Anglos, Blacks and Hispanics together produced
 
a whole new culture, one that had not existed before and one
 
with infinite internal variations.
 Thomas Edison "Brownie" Ford
 
comes from that western-most combination.  You simply can't
 
beat him.
 Of all the versions of all the western songs, his
 
are the final word; of all the voices, his is the one that makes
 
you feel, well, that's all right now, isn't it, that's what I
 
wanted to hear.  When I called a friend here in Washington to
 
ask what I should say about Brownie Ford, he said, well besides
 
his wonderful craftsmanship -
-
 he really builds a good chair -
-
BROWNIE FORD (

RUBY DEE
 and besides his awesome voice, he's always a gentleman.
 
present to you a gentleman and a Louisiana high-water cowboy
 
and a great singer, THOMAS EDISON (BROWNIE) FORD.
 
RAYMOND KANE
 
RUBY DEE
 No one is quite sure how the guitar came to Hawaii; there
 
are old paintings of vaqueros (Mexican cowboys  who were
 
brought to the islands to help set up the cattle business)
 
that show them with various fretted guitar-like instruments;
 
the Mexican people after all had invented a lot of different
 
kinds of guitars.
 It's possible too that some of the early
 
missionary ladies brought along some of their little parlor
 
instruments.  However it got there, the Hawaiian people took
 
to the guitar and made it their own -
-
 inventing an entire musical
 
style so distinctively Hawaiian that if you heard it in the
 
middle of the night in the Gobs
 desert, you'd say, there's a
 
Hawaiian playing that thing.
 It is called slack-key, because
 
the strings are tuned down so that they can s
lide and whisper
 
and vibrate sympathetically.
 It is one of the most insinuatingly
 
beautiful,rippling, evocative musical styles I have ever heard,
 
and our honoree of the evening, Mr. Raymond Kaleoalohapoinaoleohelemanu
 
Kane (
you could omit the middle name Miss Dee, but I thought
 
you might like to try i
t) has learned from the great s
tylists
 
of his own people and is today considered one of the handful

 of  master musicians of this extraordinary musical invention.
 
We can be grateful that he has consented to take on a few
 
young apprentices, just as he himself was taught many years ago,
 
so that this lovely sound will ring on through future generations.
 
Please welcome, MR. RAYMOND KANE, master guitarist.
 
JUAN ALINDATO
 
RUBY DEE
 In all societies and in all times there have always been
 
occasions when it's all right to change your everyday
 
identity, to put on different clothes, disguise your face
 
by make-up or masking, turn into an animal, or a spirit, or
 
a monster or an angel just for a little while, of course.
 
Actually changing oneself around is almost essential to the
 
whole idea of festivity -
-
 the way you know it's not everyday
 
is that everything is different including yourself!
 In the
 
town of Ponce on the southern Puerto Rican coast, a special
 
tradition of festive-day masking has grown up.
 These special
 
masks are made of papier mache,  in a design, and with aesthetic
 
characteristics forever identifiable with the annual carnival
 
of Ponce.  Many craftsmen make these masks; Senor Juan Alindato
 
Garcia, who is with us today, stands as their exemplar, their
 
representative,  for the elegance, the honest craftsmanship and
 
the traditionality of his work.  Let us celebrate that tradition
 
together.

RUBY DEE
 May I introduce Senor Alindato who is accompanied by Dr.
 
Hector Vega of the University of Puerto Rico.
 SENOR ALINDATO,
 
Can you guess how many masks you have made in your lifetime?
 
How many people have you taught mask-making?  Are there
 
some you feel are especially talented?
 
Are there some of your masks that make you feel especially
 
proud when they are finished?  What makes them special?
 
What is the hardest part of making a mask?
 
Is there something you would especially like to say to
 
these people here who like your masks so much, and to
 
your friends in Puerto Rico?
 
C.J. JOHNSON
 
RUBY DEE
 Oh n
ay.
 I want to say that everybody in this theater,  I think,
 
/
 
is sophisticated enough to be able to appreciate and admire all
 
the wonderful art that we're spreading out  before you, but
 
sooner or later, you're going to hear or see something that you
 
don't just appreciate, you plain love it.  You melt.
 It may not
 
be the fanciest thing, but it's somehow down deep your thing.
 
Sometimes it surprises you.  Maybe your  special love will turn
 
out to be polka music, or split ash baskets, or slack key guitar,
 
but sometime or other during this evening, you will stop thinking,
 
isn't that beautiful, and you will just settle back and say,
 
I think for some of us Black people,  i
t may turn out to be the
 
unaccompanied singing that Reverend C
.J. Johnson will be bringing
 
US.  The old-time gospel church didn't have organs or even pianos;
 
it couldn't afford hymn books or professional quartets or soloists -
-
what it had was voices and leaders. And those leaders lined out
 
the great old spiritual tunes and hymns so that the voices could
 
echo them back and a whole new musical literature was born -
-
 a
 
literature that I have to warn you we are in danger of losing if
 
we don't value it, and respect it, and every once in a while

up to the glory of God.
 
Reverend C
.J. Johnson of Atlanta says that the really important
 
thing about him is that he is an a cappella singer -
-
 he sings
 
without accompaniment.  There are other important things about
 
him too:  his many recordings, his long service to his church,
 
but you will hear all that in his voice as he sings along with
 
his wife Mrs.
 Johnson and
 
NEWTON WASHBURN
 
RUBY DEE
 Every man-made object lies somewhere along a continuum between
 
frivolity and necessity, but placing a particular object along
 
that continuum is sometimes more difficult than one might think.
 
Frivolity -
 decoration -often serves a serious purpose.
 Necessity
 
is not only the mother of invention but of purity of line and
 
form.  The baskets made by Newton Washburn's family -
-
 going
 
I
F
 
back four generations on both sides -
-
 were always  sturdily
 
utilitarian in purpose, made strictly for carrying, measuring,
 
and protecting precious objects (
such as their woven cradles
 
for babies).  As plastic replaced willow and ash reeds, and fewer
 
and fewer of the Washburn baskets are made, we begin to regret
 
the loss not so much of the utility of their work, for we can
 
carry, measure and protect in other ways.  What we miss is the
 
beauty.
 
Please welcome MR. NEWTON WASHBURN, master New England basket maker.
 
CROSS OVER TO CRAFTS CENTER.  MR. WASHBURN ENTERS AND SITS DOWN.
 
RUBY DEE
 I read in your biography that both sides of your family were
 
basket makers -
-
 Abenaki Indian basket makers back on your
 
mother's s
ide and basket makers from England on your father's side.
 
NEWTON WASHBURN (
continued)
 
RUBY DEE
 Can you tell the difference in the baskets they made?
 
(ONLY IF APPROPRIATE SLIDES ARE AVAILABLE)
 
Did you say one time that you never made a basket that
 
wasn't perfect?  How was that possible; while you were
 
learning you must have made mistakes?
 
Could you tell us about the time you were afraid you had
 
forgotten how to make a basket that could measure a peck?
 
1
-
low old were you when you made your first basket?  How many
 
people in your family made baskets at that time?  Did you
 
ever get together to work? -
-
 that must have been fun...
 
Is there something special you would like to say about your
 
beautiful art?  Will you keep on teaching it?  Will i
t live?
 
WADE MAINER

 The five stringed banjo can in some ways be thought of as a
 
kind of visual and tonal metaphor for a major movement in the
 
history of American folk music:
 the coming together in the
 
southern states of two powerful and vibrant musical streams,
 
one from the British Isles, the other from West Africa.
 The
 
instrument itself is plainly African in origin; that is settled.
 
The fifth or drone string was added by a left-handed Anglo-Saxon
 
banjo picker named Joe Sweeney; we know that too.  The music it
 
plays combines African rhythmic sensibility with Scotch-Irish
 
melodic complexity -
-
 but that's just the simple way of saying
 
it.  What we are still learning is that throughout the centuries
 
Black and white musicians have been listening to each other,
 
even in the bad old days in the south, borrowing from each other,
 
swapping ideas, texts and tunes, until the mountain music in
 
the Appalachian border states began to develop into i
ts own kind
 
of music -
-
 a new music that hadn't ever been heard before.  Our
 
next artist is a master banjo performer, and a fabled s
tring
 
band man -
-
 he worked with his brother J.E. Mainer in some of
 
the most influential musical ensembles of country music history.
 
WADE MAINER (

 He'll sing some for you, but I hope first of all he'll let
 
us hear that rippling totally distinctive song of the great
 
American five stringed banjo, one of the great Black-white
 
inventions to grace our country.  NR. WADE MAINER
 
LOUIS BASHELL
 
RUBY DEE
 Throughout this program this evening we seem to return over
 
and over to the idea of celebrating,  especially celebrating
 
ourselves in all our varied glory.  From one side of the nation
 
to another, we find different ways of saying who we are and how
 
great we are -
-
 our songs, our stories, our dances.
 Throughout
 
the whole northern midwest for instance, there are people who
 
dance the polka -
-
 a great joyous, bouncy, high-spirited dance
 
that lifts the heart and the feet together.
 Our next awardee
 
has played polkas all his life -
-
 beginning when he was a tiny
 
boy who had to hold his father's button accordion on his lap
 
because it was too big for him to lift.  Today -
-
 fifty years
 
later -
-
 he and his band play year round four nights a week for
 
one dance group or another -
-
 and turn down jobs on their free
 
nights.
 They have been doing this for thirty years. Many
 
professional musicians I know would envy that kind of audience
 
and that kind of steady employment.  Mr. Bashell plays in the
 
clear straightforward and unadorned style his father brought from
 
the old country -
-
 from Slovenia, now a part of Yugoslavia.
 I
 
hope there are some S
lovenians in the audience -
-
 I know there

 if there's room anywhere in the

 The folk and traditional arts generally travel s

J
.
 
between political philosophies; their values are long-standing
 
and outlast the particularities of the day to day.
 Sometimes,
 
though, particular political actions have special relevance to
 
the folk arts.  During the last few weeks the United States
 
Congress has passed legislation that attempts to repair the
 
enormous injustices done Japanese-Americans at the outbreak
 
of World War II, when they were forced to leave their homes,

 She took with her into exile within her own country
 
only a fan and a kimono with which to continue her art -

 the

the spiritual services she rendered to her own people by her
 
conscientious attempt to keep their culture, their highest art
 
form alive in the detention camps, behind bars, behind barbed
 
wire.  Madame Kansuma Fujima, our next honoree, no longer dances,

SNAIDA ROMERO
 
RUBY DEE
 Our next artist has done something that I
've done myself frequently
 
I
 
during my life-time and that I
've enjoyed very much:
 she's worked
 
most of the time in partnership with her husband.
 In fact it is
 
so difficult to separate out the work of Senaida and Emilio Romero
 
that the Folk Arts Program finally voted to give them a joint
 
award -
-
 the first time this has ever been done.  Tin work was
 
traditional in Mrs. Romero's family; she knows the craft well.
 
Seior Romero,an experienced metal worker,began his experimentation
 
with tin more than 45 years ago.  Mrs. Romero also practices the
 
art of coicha embroidery and herself thought of the innovative
 
notion of combining the two materials -
 metal and thread -
 into
 
the production of altar pieces,  saints' portraits, and the like.
 
Unfortunately,  Sef
lor Roinero's health is not of the strongest
 
and his doctor has forbidden him to take the strenuous trip to
 
Washington.
 SeRora Romero is here, however, along with several
 
of their sevel talented children -
-
 all of them grown now and
 
practicing the craft of their choice; from gem work to santos
 
carving to altar screen painting and restoration.
 Please welcome

 It's too bad your husband can't be here today,  isn't it?
 
How do you find working with yours?  Is it easy?  Hard?
 
which one thinks up the ideas or do you both?
 
I should think working with tin would be hard on your hands,
 
especially when switching to embroidery?
 
When you look at your own pieces, do you feel proud or do
 
you worry about the mistakes?  Could you tell us about
 
this one?  (TO A SPECIFIC SLIDE)
 
How did you manage i
t so that so many of your children have
 
taken up traditional craft work?  Do you also teach other
 
people outside of the family?
 
Is there anything special you would like to say about the
 
importance of your tradition?

 The explosion of Black musical creativity that followed the
 
Civil War and extended through the first half of the twentieth
 
century is yet to be examined in all its glory.
 It's impossible
 
for any single person to experience all the styles, all the
 
innovative song forms, all the instrumental inventions, so that
 
there's always something in Black music that you haven't heard
 
yet.
 We're honoring this evening a gentleman born in 1899 who
 
grew up in the heart of the Dallas Texas blues scene -
-
 he
 
walked the streets where Leadbelly, Blind Lemon Jefferson and
 
T Bone Walker played, he heard Pete Johnson and Meade Lux Levis
 
in their prime,  and hundreds of the gutsy hard-hitting, hard-hit
 
bluesmen whose names we won't ever know who played in the bars
 
along Deep Ellum.  Mr. Alex Moore Sr. spent a
ll his life in
 
Dallas; he recorded and he even toured Europe, but he always
 
went back home where as he put i
t,  you could find "an o
ld
 
piece of a piano in every shack and alley."  He plays a little
 
bit of ragtime, a little boogie woogie, a little piece of
 
barrelhouse, a little bit of blues and a little bit of s
tride;

 The small islands of the Caribbean are places where particular
 
fascinating European and African and Indian art forms have
 
combined in as many particular ways as there are islands.  But
 
in every Caribbean island there is some kind of joyful music
 
that brings the folks out to dance and parade and helps the
 
good times roll, to borrow an expression from our Cajun friends.
 
In the Virgin Islands, this music is produced by "scratch bands"
 
and we have one with us tonight, in order to properly display
 
the talent of their leader, Mr. Sylvester McIntosh who is widely
 
known throughout St. Croix as the man who knows the old songs
 
and tunes.  Mr. McIntosh plays many instruments, does "head"
 
arranging and has been leader of several influential bands,
 
playing for quadrille dances and festivals of all kinds.  His
 
current band is named "Blinky and the Roadmasters" in honor of
 
their day-time occupation at the Department of Public Works.
 
But Mr. McIntosh is no hobbyist; he is seriously interested in
 
his musical tradition and is recognized throughout the islands
 
as an authority on quadrille music, masquerading, cariso, and
 
Virgin island folksong.  We are happy to bring this lively and
 
distinctive musical tradition to wider public attention; even
 
in St. Croix i
t is sometimes drowned out by the brassier rock
 
bands of the mainland.  You won't be drowned out tonight, Mr.
 
McIntosh except by our applause -
