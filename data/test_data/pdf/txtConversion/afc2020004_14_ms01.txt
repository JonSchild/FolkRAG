Angry Red Planet 
 
Released in 1959, a dozen years before Bowie posed the same  
question, this movie trailer asked if there is Life on Mars. You  
knew it was The Angry Red Planet in question. The Coming Soon  
commercial insisted you’d be astounded by “CineMagic.” They refused  
to define this Special Effect, but they claimed Martian geography would  
seem believable. Even at twelve, you’d been fooled frequently enough  
to know CineMagic was a lure, snagging gullible fools to enter movie  
theaters again after televisions had invaded most American homes,  
glowing cyclops sentinels. The invasion a success, people watched  
the Test Pattern for hours, studied the Plains Indian head profile,  
perched atop a bullseye, providing brightness and contrast, latitude  
and longitude points so programs could beam sharp cathode rays,  
delivering convenient defined heroes and their requisite villains.  
The commercial did offer glimpses of hostile alien settings and life 
forms, so you would witness the heroes’ bravery. A forty-foot-tall 
undulating Bat-Rat-Spider-Scorpion hybrid, Martian vermin, attacked  
the crew who were only acting in self-defense, risking life and limb.  
 
But beyond the commercial, in full film context, we later understood  
the creature was responding to aggressive invaders, who then destroyed  
its eyesight with a sub-zero ray-gun beam blast, freezing its alien retinas.  
 
Minutes before, they’d landed on this vibrant distant planet overgrown  
in unknown flora. Only the female scientist caught a fleeting glimpse  
of intelligent native life. The men doubted her eyes, then decided the whole 
crew should leave their ship to explore Mars by destroying life forms. They so  
loved their weapons, the Communications Expert crew member literally  
gave his gun an affectionate name, kissed its barrel, and posed passionately  
for photos, cradling his laser rifle in a lover’s embrace, recorded for posterity. 
 
CineMagic, turns out, was a simple filter, oversaturating contrast and  
brightness, reducing nuance, flooding the frame in red ranges. All Mars  
scenes glowed crimson. This polarization was designed to hide the film’s  
budget, obscure the exotic planet rendered cheaply in shaded drawings.  
But instead of the landscape appearing lusher, the Magic merely reduced  
humans to malevolent cartoons, chopping and blasting the red planet’s  
environment, confidently claiming it as their own, history repeating itself. 
 
By the time they fled for earth, only two survived: predictably the romantic,  
flirtatious leads. We’d known them at first sight. The female scientist furtively  
dabbed perfume on her pulse points while running tests, and the male captain  
inexplicably left his space suit gaping wholly unbuttoned, displaying his hairy  
virility for her, so we’d know the other members were expendable, killed to  
heighten drama. The male scientist, collapsing frail, weakly got them off  
the planet and fainted dead against the gravitational pull of Mars,  
blood caressing his lips. Beloved or not, the freeze ray failed  
the Communications Expert when he most needed its frigid embrace. 
 
The film is told in flashback. Returning to earth, the surviving scientist  
willingly dredged memories to save her secret love, the hairy captain,  
now comatose, infected with aggressive Martian life. She must recall:  
fainting at the sight of the Red Planet’s indigene; screaming when a native  
plant defended itself after she cut it, and the captain’s rescue response, hacking  
off its offending limbs; finally remembering how she could defeat his infection.  
 
At twelve, you fall under this spell on TV, Saturday Sci-Fi Theatre, believe  
at first that it is about Mars and the future of space travel. Your brother reads  
Custer Died for Your Sins, lying beneath his beloved Red Power posters.  
He saved enough to buy the family this Color TV, from his job, after years  
of high school teachers asking why he wasted time attending classes anyway.  
He believed you deserved a sliver of middle-class American luxury, and  
in full, polarized CineMagic red, you hear the refrain of Manifest Destiny. 
 
When the explorers land, they invoke the Santa Maria’s ghost and its spectral  
companion, the label, “New World.” The crew jokes of Hard Tack and Hot  
Coffee, used to technically honor tribal treaties in subsistence terms alone.  
The land is quiet, (too quiet, of course) and before the female scientist does  
her scream and faint routine, the male captain, in casual conversation, a cocky 
grin on his face, lets you know exactly what kind of movie you’re watching. 
 
He retrieves his pistol and claims an inheritance, telling his ray-gun-kissing  
sidekick some family lore. His grandfather claimed a sixth sense made his ears  
twitch if there were Indians around, especially silent, unseen ones, and he caresses  
his side arm as if it were his short one. The scientist says if native life exists on this  
new world, it should be where they’ve landed, so they strap on and step out into  
the polarized, blazing red world, buzzing with aspirations of conquest and supremacy. 
 
In your Rez house, distant dreams of running water dampen by pleasures purchased  
in this Color TV. But you could not deny the truth your brother wanted you to see.  
Even in the age of rocket-ships and flag-planting on distant planets instead of earthly  
land masses, indigenous inhabitants were still cast as obstacles, impediments  
to conquer in the name of advancement, and your brother believed the cost of a TV  
was worth it. For now you know, finally, that Indians exist beyond the brightness  
and contrast of TV Test Patterns, and you are the proof indigenous life survives  
and thrives, growing stronger unseen, on the surface of This Angry Red Planet.
