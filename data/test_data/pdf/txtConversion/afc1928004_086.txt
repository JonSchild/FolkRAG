Oh ! 
birdie, I 
am tired now, 
I 
do not care to hear you sing; 
You've sung your happy songs all day, 
Now put your head, beneath your wing; 
I'm sleepy, too, as I 
can be— 
And, sister, when my prayer is said, 
I 
want to lay me down to rest, 
So, put me in my little bed. - 
CHORUS. 
Come, sister, coma kiss me Good-night 
For, I 
my evening prayer have said, 
I'm tired now, and sleepy too, 
Come, put me in my little bed.

sister! what did mother say, 
When she was called to heaven away ? 
She told me always to be good, 
And never, never go astray ; 
I 
can't forget the clay she died— 
She placed her band upon my head, 
She whispered softly: " Keep my child—" 
And then they told me she was dead !. 
Come, sister, 'Sze • 
Dear sister come and heir my prayer, 
Now, ere I 
lay me down to sleep, 
Within my heavenly Father's care, 
While angels bright their vigils keep, 
And let me ask of him above, 
To keep my soul in paths of right— 
Oh ! let me thank him for his love, 
Ere I 
shall Lay my last Good-night. 
Come sister, ctle

ANSWER TO PUT DIE IN MY LITTLE BED. 
The music of this song is published by Viriurg, Smirit & PERRY, ps 330 
Washington street, Boston, Price 40 cents. 
In her" little bed" we laid her, 
When the roses lost their bloom, 
And a 
valley-grave we made her, 
Close beside her mother's lonely tomb ; 
Little birdie sang his sad notes, 
As her spirit passed away, 
Ere she sought the home of angels, 
In the land of perfect day. 
Little birdie sing your sweetest, 
For, darling is an angel now, 
She is free from pain and sorrow, 
With love's star upon her heavenly brow. 
Far too lovely was our darling, 
For this cold and bitter life, 
And although we weep to miss her, 
She is free from mortal worldly strife; 
And we dream her angel mother, 
Strokes again her darling's head, 
And, amid angelic music, 
Lays her in her little bed. 
Little birdie, tte. 
Little birdie, sing your sweetest, 
Darling is an angel now, 
She is free from pain and sorrow, 
With love's star upon her heavenly brow; 
Happy child and happy mother, 
Reunited ne'er to part, 
In the angel home above us, 
Let this cheer our mournful heart. 
Little birdie, dre.

PUT THE BREAK ON WHEN YOU'RE GOING 
DOWN THE HILL. 
The " journey of existence" 
Is a 
rugged one, we know, 
Then, as you drive along the road, 
Be careful how you go, 
Keep a 
tight rein in your hand, 
Or you may get a 
spill, 
And mind and put the break on, 
When you're going down the hill. 
CIIORUS. 
For life's a 
rugged journey, 
Let men say what they will, 
So mind and put the break on, 
When you're going down the hill, 
The world is always moving, 
And man is not allowed, 
To loiter by the wayside, 
But must go with the crowd, 
Who travel on life's dreary way, 
To bring grist to the mill, 
But he's bound to put the break on 
When he's going down the hill. 
For life's a 
rugged journey, ikc. 
The fastest race is soonest run 
Upon the great high way 
Of life—as folks discover 
If they travel night and day, 
The road is sometimes level. 
But in spite of strength and skill, 
You're bound to put the break on, 
When you're going down the hill. - 
For life's a 
rugged journey, &e.. 
In search of empty pleasures, 
Many travel on so fast, 
But find the pace too killing, 
So they come to grief at last. 
And when " Old Time" o'ertakes them 
And nature claims her bill. 
They'll wish they'd put the break on, 
Ere they'd travell'd down the hill. 
For life's a 
rugged journey, &c.

THE YORKSHIRE FARMER. 
As sung by JAMES TAYLOR, Champion Comiquo of the world. 
I 
am a 
jolly old farmer man, 
And go by the name of Yorkshire Sam; 
Hale and hearty too, I 
am, 
As you may plainly see. 
I 
remember well when I 
used to prance, 
And join in the merry village dance; 
But I'm not so young as I 
used to be, 
About forty years ago. 
CHORUS 
The boys and girls of the Tiling' say, 
Whenever I 
happen to pass that way ; 
There's good old Sam, the farming man, 
Hurray I 
hurray 1 
hurray I 
About forty years ago, my boys, 
I 
took myself a 
wife ; 
And she has been a 
boon to me, 
And the comfort of my life. 
I 
remember well, when she used to say, 
It's a 
pity to let time slip away ; 
But we're not so young as we used to be, 
About forty years ago. 
The boys and girls, ((re. 
I 
remember well in the harvest time,. 
When we used to mow the hay; 
We used to get our home-brewed ale, 
In the bottle every day. 
Them were the times to enjoy one's self, 
There wasn't so much grinding after pelf; 
But remember I 
am speaking of 
Some forty years ago. 
The boys and girls, & 
BONNIE DUNDEE. 
Sir Walter Scott's Famous Ballad, sung by Mils. HOWARD PAUL. 
To the lairds of Convention 'twos Claverhouse spoke, 
Ere the king's crown shall fa' there are crowns to be broke. 
To each cavalier who loves honor and me, 
Let him follow the bonnets of bonnie Dundee. 
CIIORUB. 
Come fill up my cup, come fill up my can, 
Come saddle my horses and call out my men; 
Unlock the west port and let us go free, 
For it's up with the bonnets of bonnie Dundee: 
Dundee he is mounted, l
ite rides up the street, 
The bells are rung backwards, the drums they are beat; 
But the provost douce men, said " just e'en let him be, 
For the town is weal rid o' that deil o' Dundee!" 
Come fill up my cup, &e. 
There are hills beyond Pentland and lands beyond Forth, 
If ye've lairds in the South there are Chiefs in the North, 
There are brave Dhuinee vassals, three thousand times three, 
Will cry hey 1 
for the bonnets of bonnie Dundee! 
Come fill up my cup, &c. 
Then awa' to the hills, to the lea, to the rocks, 
Ere I 
own a 
uQurper I'll couch with the fox; 
And tremble, fause Whigs, in the midst o' your glee, 
For ye've no seen the last o' my bonnets and me. 
Come fill up, &C.

PARTING AT THE GATE, 
I 
was walking out one evening, 
'Twas in the month of May. 
A 
little maid was by my side, 
Who'd stole my heart away ; 
She looked so loving and so sweet, 
I 
vowed that soon or late, 
I'd steal a 
kiss from this young Miss 
When parting at the gate. 
We met quite often after that, 
Till on one summer night 
I 
told my love, she did the same, 
I 
trembled with delight; 
She promised to be always mine, 
I 
blessed my lucky fate, 
Of course I 
kissed this darling- Miss 
When parting at the gate. 
Time has passed and we have now 
Our hearts together tied ; 
Our lives are filled with happiness, 
The hours they sweetly glide; 
But I 
will ne'er forget that night 
I 
vowed that soon or late 
I'd sweetly kiss a 
charming Miss 
When parting at the gate, 
• • 
VIE CAMERON MEN. 
There's many a 
man of the Cameron clan, 
That has followed his chief to the field : 
He has sworn to support him, or die by his side 
• For, a 
Cameron never will yield. 
CHORUS. 
I 
hear the pibroch sounding, 
Deep o'er mountain and glen, 
While light springing footsteps are trampling the heath, 
"fie the march of the Cameron men 
Oh I 
proudly they walk; but each Cameron knows 
He may tread on the heather no more. 
But boldly he follows his chief to the field, 
Where his laurels were gathered before. 
I 
hear the pibroch, &C. 
The moon has arisen, it shines on their path, 
Now trod by the gallant and true; 
High, high are their hopes, for their chieftain has said 
That whatever men dare, they can do. 
I 
hear the pibroch, &c.

LAGER BEER SALLY WAS HER NAME. 
HAMPAGNE CHARLIE. 
I'll sing you of a 
red-head gal, 
That lives in this here town; 
The boys they call her hobby Sal; 
She was known for miles around. 
Her eyes were bright, her teeth were white, 
Her hands were just the same; 
She was often seen out late at night, 
For she had lager on the brain. 
CHORUS. 
Lager Beer Sally was her name, 
Lager Beer Sally was her name, 
She was handsome, she was fair, 
But she likes her good old beer. 
Red-head Sally was her name, 
Red-head Sally was her name, 
She was always kicking up a 
row down here, 
Aiid she was always ready for her beer. 
One evening she wa8 out quite late, 
When she met with a 
gay young man; 
One glance from her eye did seal his fate, 
er smiles be could not withstand, 
By her request they started off, 
He with love was quite insane; 
And she was bound to enjoy the sport, 
For she had lager on the brain. 
Lager Deer Sally, etc. 
They drank to excess and both got tight, 
A 
bad fix she was in, 
This gay young sport began to fight, 
When two police rushed in ; 
This horrible sight we must deplore, 
They were dragged to jail quite near, 
Where she is doing six months or more, 
Without her lager beer. 
Lager Beer Sally, etc.

I'M ONE OF THE OLDEN TIME, 
Oh, I 
was born some years ago 
When George the Third was King, 
And yet it seems but yesterday, 
For time is on the wing. 
Yes, I'm one of the olden time, 
And may be thought too slow; 
But give to me the good old days 
Of fifty years ago. 
Yes, give to me the good old days 
Of fifty years ago. 
CHORUS. 
Yes, I'm one of the olden time, and may be thought too slow, 
But give to me the good old days, of fifty years ago— 
Yes, give to me the good old days of fifty years ago. 
I 
bear the name of Benjamin, 
Tho' some they call me Ben, 
And thro' this life I've rolled along 
For three score years and ten. 
The world is always on the move, 
At least they tell us so, 
And every day we must improve, 
But I 
should like to know— 
If folks are any better now 
Than fifty years ago, [Yes, I'm one, &e. 
When I 
was young, then boys were boys, 
And went to bed at ten; 
And never put on airs at all, 
Or ap'd the ways of men. 
But now they call for bitter beer, 
And in your face will blow 
The smoke from penny Cu bas foul, 
Oh, I 
should 1 
ke to know, 
What would our parents think of that. 
Some fifty years ago, [Yes, Pm one, &e.. 
At midnight, too, we hear young men, 
With husky voices sing, 
" 
Champagne Charlie is my name !" 
And they know it's no such t 
To hear them praise a 
sparkling wine, 
It makes a 
man severe, 
When they know they cannot raise the price 
Of half a 
pint of beer, 
Yes, they know they cannot raise the price 
Of half a 
pint of beer, [Yes, Fin one, Jze.

COME INTO THE GARDEN MAUD. 
Sung by MRS. HOWARD PAUL, in her representation of the tenor. 
Come into the garden, Maud, 
For the black bat night has flown, 
Come into the garden, Maud, 
I 
am here at the gate alone; 
For the woodbine spices are wafted abroad, 
And the musk of the roses blown. 
For a 
breeze of morning moves, 
And the planet of love is on high, 
Beginning to faint in the light that she loves, 
On abed of daffodil sky; 
To faint in the light of the sun she loves, 
To faint in its light and to die. 
Queen of the rosebud, garden of girls, 
Come hither, the dances are done; 
In gloss of satin and glimmer of pearls, 
Queen, lily, and rose, in one; 
Shine out, little head, sunning over with curls, 
To the flowers, and be their sun. 
She is coming, my own, my sweet; 
Were it over so airy a 
tread, 
My heart would hear her and beat, 
Were it earth in an earthy bed. 
Come into the garden, Maud, 
For the black bat night has flown.

ALL AMONG THE HAY.—[CONCLUDED.] 
She 's 
of bonny girls the queen, 
Born to be admir'd; 
Roaming out one day I'd been, 
Feeling rather tired, 
When as graceful as a 
fawn, 
She stood in my way, 
With a 
cask of " Barleycorn," 
All among the hay. 
CHORUS. — All among the hay, &c. 
Of the beer I 
had a 
sup, 
Feeling then " all right ;" 
She said " to the brimming cup 
I 
was welcome quite." 
But she soon did me astound, 
Begg'd I'd go away; 
" 
Rakes," she said, " were often found 
All among the hay." 
CHORUS.—All among the hay, (te. 
Still for all that I 
could see 
She was shamming cold; 
"Bought off" she should never be, 
I 
would not be " sold ;" 
Bouncing came a 
rival raw, 
But I 
made him " pay,"

THE BOLD PRIVATEER, 
Farewell, my lovely Nancy, 
Ten thousand times adieu, 
I'm going away to leave you, 
To seek for something new ; 
Come change yoEr rings with me, my love, 
Come change your rings, with me, 
And love letters I 
will write to you, 
When I 
am on the sea, 
For the secrets of the heart, my dear, 
With the best of my good will, 
And let my body be where it may, 
My heart is with you still. 
Farewell, my lovely Nancy, 
I'm going away from you, 
And now that I 
am going, my dear, 
I 
hope you will prove true ; 
I'll wander o'er each moun'ain, 
And I'll travel o'er each hill, 
And let my body be where it may, 
My heart, is with you still, 
For the snips are on the ocean, 
And the crew will soon be here. 
And we're all a 
going on board 
Of the Bold Privateer.

OH I'M SO FOND OF DANCING. 
Oh, I'm so fond of dancing, I 
never can say no, 
While the dances are advancing on a 
light fantastic toe ; 
And when at balls or parties, I 
am sure to cut a 
swell, 
For in dancing there my heart is, as every one can tell. 
CHORUS. 
Oh I'm so fond of dancing, I 
never can say no, 
While the bright eyes are advancing on a 
light fantastic toe. 
In the lancers I'm perfection, mazurka is my forte, 
By the ladies in general my hand is often sought, 
The gents give looks of envy as we go gliding by, 
And the ladies in the Waltz s 
are often heard to sigh. 
Oh, I'm so fond, gic. 
We never care for sorrow, rnv heart is free and light, 
For I'm dancing in the morning, the evecing and the night, 
We never care for trouble, we never do complain, 
And if we lose our sweethearts, another too we'll gain. 
Oh, I'm so fond, & e.

CHARMING HENRIETTA. 
Chin, chin, chow, that's very good china, 
Means I'm going to sing for you 
About a 
curious beau of mine, Sir, 
A chow chow chopsticks from Hong Kong. 
Chopstick was a 
Bohea merchant, 
Finest teas he used to grow, 
Wishing for a 
Yankee bride 
He used to bore and bother me so. 
(SromEN.)With 
CHORUS. 
Chin, chin, charming Henrietta, 
Chow, chow, love you so, 
You're the prettiest girl in China, 
Ah ! me, dont say no. 
Chopstick he was tall and slender, 
Nasal organ rather small, 
His complexion rather sooty, 
From his crown a 
pigtail did fall. 
Finger nails so long I 
think he'll 
Surely scratch himself some day, 
Little eyes that used to twinkle 
Every time he to me would say. 
Chin, chin, ate.

lit was where the woodbine twineth, behind a 
floral screen, 
In a 
graceful pose reclineth, a 
maid of sweet sixteen. 
Sc enchanting was the picture, I 
could not pass it by, 
But I 
stood as if a 
statue, for beauty charms the eye; 
Then I 
saw that she was reading, to while away the time, 
And my anxious gaze unheeding, beneath the woodbine vine. 
CHORUS. 
But I 
love her so, as you all may know, 
This pretty little creature on the portico. 
It was there we met, I 
will ne'er forget, 
Down where the woodbine twineth. [Dance. 
There I 
stood like one bewilder'd. what course could I 
pursue, 
With her loveliness enraptured, I 
knew not what to do, 
As a 
balmy breeze then wafted, her fan tell on the ground, 
While in ecstacy I 
grasp'd it. fair maid, your fan I've found. 
Then she smiled and thanked me kindly, with blushes like 
carmine, 
And she sweetly said she'd meet me, beneath the woodbine 
vine. 
But I 
love her so, dtc. 
The appointed time for meeting, was Sunday night at eight, 
And what happened on that evening, to you I 
will relate; 
Now her Pa and Ma were absent, and she was left alone, 
As her parents gave their consent that she might stay at 
home; 
So she played the grand piano, I 
sang and danced in time, 
And we sat on the veranda, beneath the woodbine vine. 
But I 
love her so, &c. 
There we met, we loved, we parted, my heart with joy cloth 
swell, 
For to me she breathed a 
secret, with darling don't you tell, 
But I 
soon became acquainted with her Papa and Ma, 
She's in ey'ry vision painted, my love, my euiding star. 
Now my story's almost ended. I've married Caroline, 
And we live where once we flirted, beneath the woodbine vine 
lovc her so, &c.

THE OLD MAID. 
Air—" WhedI was a 
girl of eighteen." 
When I 
was a 
girl of eighteen years old, 
I 
was scornful as scornful could be; 
I 
was taught to expect wit, wisdom, and gold, 
And nothing else would do for me; 
Ah, those were the days when my eyes beam'd bright, 
And my cheek was like the rose on the tree, 
And the ringlets they curl'd o'er my forehead so white, 
And lovers came a 
courting me. 
The first was a 
youth any girl might adore, 
As ardent as lover could be; 
But my mother having heard that theyoung man was 
Why! ho would not do for me. 
And now came a 
lawyer, his claims to support, 
By precedents from Chancery; 
But I 
told him, I 
was judge in my own little court, 
And he would not do for me. 
The next was a 
dandy, who had driven four in hand, 
Reduced to a 
Gig—d'ye see ? 
in getting o'er the ground, he had run thr3' his land, 
So he would not do for me. 
These were nearly the last—I 
was then forty-four, 
I 
am now only just fifty three; 
But I 
really think that some I 
rejected before, 
Would do now very well for me. 
Then, all ye young ladies, by me warning take, 
Who scornful or cold chance to be;

She took me by the hand, 
She said, I

In shape; of mortal man. 
I 
told her that I 
loved her 
My love was good and strong, 
I 
asked her if she'd marry me, 
She told me to go 'long. 
Come and kiss me, 
Come and kiss me,

Com', and kiss me, Susie, 
Don't be mad with me.

Why married we will be!

THE GIRLS OF BOSTON. 
The girls of Boston are fairest of the fair, 
With cork screw curls and taffy candy hair, 
I've watched them close and really du declare, 
I 
hadn't caught one till to- day. 
When promenading Beacon street to-day, 
I 
saw a 
maiden dressed so neat and gay, 
She said, why, Cool, and prithee now which way, 
Of course I 
walked along with her. 
[Spoken—I 
was surprised, she being a 
stranger, but then she 
was so fair, and besides, being a 
Boston girl, I 
could not help 
treating her civil for every one in Boston has been so kind to 
me, so 1 
told her, ] 
CHORUS. 
I 
thought I'd never leave her, 
And then it was such fun, 
To take a 
stroll out with her, 
This young girl of Boston. 
She wore a 
jaunty, canning little hat, 
I 
thought I'd never seen one to equal that. 
But then she kept her face so closely veiled, 
I 
longed to take a 
peep under there. 
At last we arrived at a 
modest little house, 
She raised her veil to kiss me in the month, 
She wouldn't ask me in for she was black as coal 
I 
skeddadled home now you can bet— 
[Spoken.—So as she was black— 
I 
made up my mind to leave her, 
But I

FAREWRLL NARY AVORNEEN. 
My Mary Avorneen, 'tis now we must part, 
Be strong, dear acushla, don't let the tears start. 
I 
go to the strife both bravely and true, 
Be sure, Mollie darling, 
ever love you. 
The thought of your love will gladden my heart, 
And make your own Shamus bear bravely his part. 
Ah, Mary Avorneen, 'tis now we must part, 
Be strong, dear acushla, don't let the tears start. 
My Mary Avorneen, it is not for gold, 
I'd leave you alone—my heart's not so cold; 
But rather for right and Old Ireland's sake, 
The boy of Glengall will make tyrant's quake ; 
The maids of dear Erin, " God bless them" and all— 
Their prayers Mollie ask for the boy of Glengall. 
Then farewell my Mary, oh yes, we must part, 
Be strong, dear acushla, don't let the tears start. 
Love, Mary Avorneen, I 
now have left thee, 
To make dear old Ireland a 
land'of the free, 
Here's that we may live to hear the words said— - 
Old Ireland's green now waves o'er the red. 
The Harp of Old Erin, her strings shall renew 
The " Ever Green Flag," and the " Red White and. Blue,' 
Must wavo to all nations from staff, mast and tri,e, 
As emblems of nations who boast to be free.

POLLY CROW.—NONCLUDED.1 
As on we both did jog, I 
admired the little dog, 
And asked about its mother and its age; 
She said 'twas three months old, and also I 
was told 
That at home she had a 
parrot in a 
cage. 
I 
begg'd that I 
might call just to see her pretty Poll, 
She said, " 0 
yes, with pleasure, that I 
might ;" 
She then came to a 
stop, just before a 
chandler's shop, 
And ask'd me in; I 
follow'd with delight.—Cno. 
Her mother she sold candles, mix'd pickles, and broom handles, 
Red herrings, sugar, mustard, snuff, and tea, 
Firewood, soap, and cheese, hair oil, and split peas, 
And a 
jolly fat old body, too, was she. 
With Polly. out I'd roam, oi make myself at home, 
In the little snug back parlor (well I 
know), 
And one day to Mrs. C----, o'er a 
cup of strong Bohea, 
I 
promised that I'd mirry Polly Crow.—Cno. 
Now every afternoon a 
fellow'd play a 
tune 
On a 
dilapidated old banjo, 
He'd stand in the gutter, .7here he used to strum and splutter; 
The boys they called him Burnt Cork Joe. 
Sometimes he'd try to sing, or do a 
solo on one string, 
Then he'd go round with his cap when he'd done; 
The folks he used to tell that he was a 
noble swell, 
And only played the banjo just for fun.—Cuo. 
He'd heave tremendous sighs, show the whites of his eyes, 
And one day he told Polly at the door, 
That if with him she'd roam, he'd offer her a 
home, 
And he'd never play the banjo any more. 
His father was a 
nobleman, and when the old chap died, 
he'd then have land and riches in galore; 
So simple-minded Polly agreed to be his bride, 
And off she went, and never came back more.—Cno. 
When her mammy found next day her child had gone away, 
She put the shutters up, and closed the door, 
She tore her old gray hairs, and rushing up the stairs, 
Committed suicide upon the second floor. 
Now Polly may be seen with a 
greasy tambourine, 
And with scarce a 
bit of leather to her feet, 
I 
can but have pity on her, she's a 
black prima donna 
To a 
band of dirty niggers in the street.—CDo.

than one, so I 
took a 
wife, and caught a 
tartar, and found two of a 
trade could never agree, and proved the proverb, that marry in haste, 
repent at leisure. 
They say beauty is but skin deep, but ugliness is 
deeper. 
If beauty is but skin deep, what a 
fool a 
man must be to 
skim all the cream off the milk and leave nothing but the curd to sour 
in his own stomach. But I'm not unhappy, oh no! for I 
know it can't 
last. 
For I 
never meet troubles half way, 
Or fret after things that are passsed; 
If bad luck comes in the way, 
I'm happy, because it can't last. 
I've got neither houses nor land, 
Nor money in funds or in purse ; 
My furaiture's not very grand, 
Some think my position a 
curse. 
I'm threadbare, I'm hampered with strife, 
On every toe I've got corns : 
I've a 
devil that law calls a 
wife, 
And the neighbors all say I've got horns

HAPPY NAN, OR IT' CAN'T t.itST.---CONeLUDED. 
Spoken—Yes, I've a 
wife, my wife's got a 
tonnte, well I 
know it, it 
is a 
tongue. 
It's a 
night tongue, a 
day tongue, in fact it's a 
perpetual 
tongue; it hangs on a 
swivel, wags at both ends; then she keeps a 
jackdaw and poll parrot to help her out with it, and when she's hard 
pushed she'll tread on the cat's tail to raise an extra squall, and knock 
down the fireirons by way of an accompaniment. Then there's my 
home, it is a home. My home resembles a 
battle of confusion. A. 
hundred schoolboys playing in a 
court; in fact .it's like a 
dustman's 
bell on one side of my ear, and a 
postman's on the other. 
But I 
am 
not unhappy, for it can't last. 
For I 
never, 8co. 
Now if I 
speak but a 
word of my mind, 
By way of concluding my song; 
.I hope you will all be so kind, . 
As to think that I 
don't instance wrong. 
To see you all round me so gay, 
Is the happiest moment I've passed; 
But when you are all gone away, 
I 
shall be happy, because it can't last. 
Spoken—Whl.t different creatures women are before marriage to what 
they are after it. 
Now, my wife before marriage was as sweet and as 
welcome to me as the first flower in spring, but as soon as the sun of 
matrimony shines on her, she became as changeable as tulips, proud 
as the poppy, thorny as a 
briar, stony as a 
plum, sour as a 
grub, sting. 
lug as a 
nettle, hot as a 
horseradish, deadly as night shade, as wanton 
as the ivy, and as destructive as slugs. 1 
here was no pleasing her, 
nor no hoeing her. I 
couldn't lop her, the law wouldn't wop her, then 
she'd run to seed every year, and the little seedlings were as wild as 
the parent stem. 
They'd neither 
transplant or cultivate them. 
There's my home, it is a 
home. My home resembles an hospital. Poor 
little Tommy has been bit by a 
mad dog;poor little Harry, he's broke 
his leg, poor little Fanny, she's got the scarlatina, poor little Polly, 
she's got the whooping cough, and the blessed baby's got the measles, 
and I 
expects myself to have the small pox shortly, and through my 
wilb's ways we are reduced to one room, and that smokes, but where 
there's a 
will there's a 
way. If the room smokes, put the fire out, if 
the children begin to squall, put them out, and if your wife begins to 
blow you up, put on your hat and go out yourself, it can't last.

Pufid out with this and that; 
And big as pumpkins, waterfalls, 
Beneath a

Two hours full to view. 
And pride myself a 
beauty rare, 
As many young girls do.

Who's doing none too well; 
To buy a

Should he be rather gay; 
Or turn my nose up, if by chance, 
I

And he, I'd want with common sense, 
And not a

Nor yet his curly hair, 
Nor one whose ma is his support, 
For none such would 1

I 
wouldn't slather on the paint, 
To make my skin look fair; 
Or of my beau be talking ' bout, 
When walking here and there, 
I'd only wish to be a 
girl. 
That I 
might this enjoy; 
Because I 
heard a 
lady sing, 
She wished herself a 
boy.

13HE HAD SUCH WHEEDLING WAYS. 
Perambulating Broadway, one day I 
chanced to meet 
A pretty little damsel, dress'd so beautifully neat; 
The little dear, with face so fair, had a 
bright and wicked eye, 
And knew the mode of using them particularly sly. 
Oh, she was a 
perfect screamer; 
Oh, how much I 
did esteem her; 
Oh, I 
wish I'd never seen her— 
She had such wheedling ways. ' 
She walked with ease and dignity, and proud, too, was her 
mein; 
She wore a 
long and sweeping skirt, with capacious crinoline; 
A 
Paisley shawl her shoulders graced, and on her head one of 
those dears 
Of bonnets, perched up high in front, and pinched in at the 
ears. 
Oh, she was, &c. 
I 
followed her until she stopped, a 
picture shop to view, 
When a 
feeling strange stole over me that I 
must sto.p 
there too. 
The space between us, wide at first, grew narrow by degrees, 
Until I 
felt a 
sharp steel-hoop sensation at my knees. 
Oh, she was, &c. 
With what peculiar incidents the life of man is fraught: 
By some mishap the fringe around her shawl a 
button caught, 
[111

SHE HAD SUCH WHEEDLING WAYS—[coNcLunED.1 
611e, blushing, begged my pardon, then some wicked looks 
dispatched. 
And jokingly observed: " How very soon we are attached." 
Oh, she was, & c. 
In conversation, walking on, to kind inquiries made, 
She said, " I 
am an architect in the bonnet building trade ; 
But just to benefit my health, and wanting change of scene, 
I 
now am acting feeder to an envelope machine."' 
Oh, she was, (4:c. 
She said, " Oh, what a 
splendid diamond ring that is you wear ; 
I 
think it's just about my size, l'd like to try it, dear ;" 
She took it off my finger then, and placed it on her own ; 
And I 
felt proud of such a 
gem, so brilliantly it shone. 
Oh, she was, & c. 
I 
cannot think how I 
could be of so much sense bereft: 
But we supping were at Taylor's, when, just before I 
left, 
A gent walked in and walked her out; and the matter not to 
mince, 
I've never seen nor that there gent, nor that there gal, not since. 
Oh, she was a 
perfect screamer; 
Oh, how much I 
did esteem her ; 
I 
little thought she was a 
schemer, 
She had such wheedling ways.

THE DREAM OF THr REVFLI.
R . 
Re-written by Mn. iizsity RUSSELL, for 21Es HowAny PAUL. 
Around the board the guests were met, 
The light above them gleaming-, 
And in their cups, replenisli'd oft, 
The ruddy wine was streaming; 
Their cheeks were flush'd, their eyes were bright, 
Their hearts with pleasure bounded, 
The song was sung, the toast was given 
And loud the revel sounded. 
I 
drain'd my bumper with the rest, 
And cried, " Away with sorrow 
Let me be happy but to- day, 
And care not for to-morrow I" 
But as I 
spoke my sight grew dim, 
And slumber deep came o'er me, 
And ' mid the whirl of mingling tongues, 
This vision passed before me. 
Methoug*ht I 
saw a 
demon rise; 
He held a 
mighty bicker, 
Whose burnish'd sides ran daily o'er 
With floods of burning liquor; 
Around him press'd a 
clam'rous crowd, 
To taste the liquor greedy, 
But chiefly came the poor and sad, 
The suning and the needy; 
All those oppress'd by grief and debts, 
The dissolute and lazy, 
Blear-eyed old men, and reckless youths, 
And palsied women crazy. 
"Give, give !" they cried; " give, give us drink, 
To drown all thought of sorrow, 
If we are happy but to-day, 
We care not for to- morrow !" 
The first drop warms their shivering skins, 
And drives away their sadness ; 
The second lights their sunken eyes, 
And fills their souls with gladness; 
THE DREAM OF THE REVELER. 
[CONCLUDED]. 
The third drop makes them shout and rave, 
And play each furious antic; 
The fourth drop boils their very blood, 
The fifth drop drives them frantic. 
"Drink I" says the demon, " drink your fill, 
Drink of these wa ters 
They'll make your bright eyes blear and dull, 
And turn your white skin yellow. 
Though virtue sink, and reason fail, 
And social ties dissever, 
I'll he your friend in hour of need, 
And find you home for ever. 
For I 
have built three mansions high, 
Three strong and goodly houses, 
A workhouse for the jolly soul 
Who all his life carouses. 
An hospital to lodge the sot, 
Oppress'd by pain and languish; 
A 
prison full of dungeons deep, 
• 
Where hopeless felons languish; 
So drain the cup and drink again, 
And drown all thoughts of sorrow 
Be happy if you can to day, 
And never mind to- morrow." 
But well he knows, this demon old, 
How vain is all his preaching, 
The ragged crew that round him flock 
Are heedless of his teaching ; 
Even as they hear h 
s 
fearful words, 
They cry with shouts of laughter, 
"Out on the fool 
who mars to- day, 
With thoughts of an hereafter. 
We care not for thy houses three, 
We live but for the present, 
And merry we will make it yet, 
And quaff our bumper plesasant." 
Loud laughs the fiend to hear them speak, 
And lifts his brimming hicker, 
"Body and soul are mine," qnoth he; 
"1.11 have them both for liquor."

Wound up with big damages-10,000 pounds. •

Ri tot de roI, do rot, do ra,

POLLY PUT THE KETTLE OIL 
I 
am a 
merry, happy chap, 
A 
jolly cove am I, 
One of those very merry boys 
Who never will say die; 
I 
have a 
very loving wife, 
Her age is twenty-one, 
She's like me and other folks, 
So fond of harmless fun. 
Sometimes we invite a 
friend, 
An hour or two we pass, 
For nothing beats at home, 
A 
social pipe and glass; 
And when the clock is striking four, 
It's then I 
sing with glee, 
"Polly, put the kettle on, 
Well all have tea." 
CHORUS. 
Polly, put the kettle on, 
The kettle on, the kettle on, 
Polly, 2ut the kettle on, 
And make it sing with glee. 
Polly, put the kettle on, 
The kettle on, the kettle on, 
Polly, put the kettle on, 
We'll all have tea. 
Now when a 
very little lad, 
I've often heard them say, 
Polly, put the kittle on, 
And clean the things away; 
Don't sit reading there so long, 
But get the tea things laid, 
And when being done. 
A 
pretty aspnet made, 
There's nothing looks much nicer, 
On a 
cold and frosty day, 
Than to see the toast and butter, 
Shining on the tray ; 
So like I've heard it when a 
child, 
POLLY PUT THE KETTLE ON.—[CONCLUDED. 
Those words still stick to me, 
Polly, put the kettle On, 
We'll all have tea. 
Polly, put the kettle on, cf;c. 
A 
brother I've, a 
sailor, 
The other day came home, 
He told us of his travels, 
And where he'd been to roam; 
He told us of his battles, 
What wondrous things he did, 
And when he'd hoist his slacks, 
And chew another quid. 
I 
gazed with all astonishment, 
At his altered style, 
And judge of my surprise. 
Altho' it made me smile, 
For with a 
voice like thunder, 
To io.y missus shouted out, 
"Polly, put the kettle on, 
We'll all have tea." 
Polly, put the kettle on, & e. 
1,
To matter where I 
go, 
Or when invited out, 
As the clock is striking four, 
You'll hear my welcome shout ; 
Some folks may laugh at me, 
For them I 
do not care, 
As I'm a 
chap as you call see, 
I'm jolly everywhere ; 
So not to break the friendship, 
I 
ask you one and all, 
Some afternoon when you have time, 
On me to make a 
call, 
And as the dock is striking four, 
Its then I'll shout with glee, 
" 
Polly, put the kettle on, 
e'll all have tea."

And didn't Dolly stare, aye, 
We enjoyed ourselves right well, 
But where my Dolly's got to,

Then we went to the Crystal Palace, 
That's down in the Whitechapel Road ; 
And then the British Museum, too, 
-What stands on Primrose Bill, 
And then we seed some wax works, 
Of sights we had our fill. 
Spoken—Aye, didn't. Dolly like them wax works—all alive— 
opened their eyes quite natural ; there was Mr. Richard the 
third talking to Tropman, and Lord John Bright walking arm 
in arm with Guy Fawkes, and. there was Jack Sheppard a 
taking tea with Queen Elizabeth, and Mabel Gray te playing, 
dominoes with the Prince of Wales, didn't we larf, but now I 
am melancholly, fur— 
Oh, where's my Dolly, dic. 
Next we seed Buckingham Pallis, 
And there we seed the Queen, 
A

And, looking all " serene ;" 
Ana next we took a 
Blackwall boat,

And went to see the " Zoo," 
The Animiles, the Crockeydiles 
And the roaring Cockatoo.

his tail under his left ear, and eats two men and a boy for 
breakfast every mornino-,

neck about three yards long, musn't he suffer when he has a 
sore throat? how we did larf, but now I']IL

Next we went to see " Formosa," 
Up in the gal-le-ry, 
My Dolly said ' twas touching, 
And. soon begins to cry; 
When we came out the crowd it squeezed, 
Forget it I 
ne'er shall, 
And when I 
come to look around, 
I 
couldn't find my gal. 
Oh, where's my Dolly, &c. 
Spoken— Couldn't see her nowberes, I 
called. " Dolly !" then 
another chap called. " Dolly !" and then 
every body called 
"

One chap said she'd. been taken up for s• ceding 
pigeon's milk, another said. she'd. eloped with a 
Ilorse marine, 
and. a 
Perliceman said he could swear he saw my Dolly hang.

I

If I

Whatever shall I

I 
met a 
maiden fair to see, 
At Landmann's, where we 'd 
shrimps and tea, 
And as she pull'd the prawns in two, 
She discolated me, a 
few; 
The avenue cars had ceas'd to run, 
The lager and the tea were done, 
So I 
proposed to seek the Park, 
And walk there until dark.-Ah I 
Spoken.-She said she would; and we were about to set out, 
when I 
looked at her feet, and, 0 
horrors! found her shoemaker 
had forgotten fashionable heels, so I 
gently remarked-Cuoaus 
Up at a 
friend's house t'other night, 
I 
danced and sang till morning light, 
And through the ladies whispers ran, 
" 
Oh ! is 'nt he a 
charming man ?" 
At last the moment came to go, 
Aly friend came up, and said, " I 
know 
That you will so good-natur'd be 
As home this lady see."-Ah! 
Spoken.-Ileavens! she was as ugly as sin-lived in Astoria! 
There was no wheelosipedc, and it was raining buckets; so, con-
templating my patent leathers, I 
remarked-Cuoaus. 
At last, grown tired of single life, 
I 
took unto myself a 
wife, 
And settled down to wedded lot 
Within a 
sweet suburban cot; 
I 
thought I 
had my charmer's love, 
And called her darling, pet, and dove; 
But vain the bliss that I 
had hop'd, 
One evening off she slop'd.-Ah I 
Spoken.-Yes; and my friends all urged me to follow her-to 
Vhoot the betrayer-and, above all, to bring her back. 
But my

Although quite " I

Such sweet strains they linger yet 
Remind me of the time we met, 
How I 
met my loved one, I 
blessed the happy day, 
That fate led me to the Druid Hill Park, when the band 
began to play. 
We sat in silence for a

Just as I 
pressed on her lips a 
kiss, the band began to play. 
Such sweet, & c. 
We wandered thro' the splendid lanes, until it grew quite dark, 
I 
determined that I'd know my fate before I 
left the park. 
" 
My angel, you've my heart," I 
said, " I 
want yours, don't say 
nay," 
She answered yes and sweetly then; tho band began to play.

I REALLY CAN'T KEEP STILL. 
In the days of my youthful innocence, 
I've heard my mother say ; 
There was nothing ever could keep me still, 
By night or yet by day. 
How often they scolded me and beat me too, 
And threatened for to kill, 
But the plague came on me day by day, 
And now I 
can't keep still. 
CHORUS. 
I 
really can't keep still, 
I 
really can't keep still, 
'Tis a 
fact that whether I 
sit or stand, 
I. really can't keep still. 
Whilo sitting on my bench at school, 
My feet they went, tap, tap ; 
When I 
said my task, I 
was, gig, gig, gig, 
And then I'd get the strap. 
If I 
went to church, it was just the same, 
Though sitting in a 
pew ; 
My mother would pinch me, just because, 
I 
took a 
step or two. 
I 
really can't, etc. 
As witness once in court I 
went, 
They told me to be still, 
As dancing was against their rules, 
I 
said, of course I 
will, 
But soon I 
commenced a 
lively tune, 
And the jury, judge and all, 
Commenced to jump and dance about, 
As though it was a 
ball. 
I 
really can't, etc. 
To get married, I 
went to church, one day, 
And very strange to say, 
That I 
felt as though I 
could do the job 
In a 
quiet sort of way. 
When the minister came to the solemn part, 
And said you two are one ; 
I took my darling by the hand, 
For home I 
quickly run. 
I 
really can't, etc.

KISS ME MOTHER ERE I DIE. 
What joy to return to my once happy home 
What bliss to again view the spot 
Where in evening's calm beauty we wandered alone 
From our humble but sweet little cot. 
In my dreams I 
have seen him repeating his vo—s, 
While sadly my eyes filled with tears, 
When we talked of our future—our happiness, too 
And my hopes, that so soon turned to fears. 
For he called me his darling, be called me his clove, 
Deceived me, and left me the cold world to rove. 
The angels are calling aloud from above 
" 
Mother, kiss me, ere I 
die I" 
I 
wish that those days would return once again, 
When under a 
dear mother's care, 
lie promised me all that his wealth could obtain 
If I 
with him my life I 
would share. 
I 
fled from my home—scorned a 
mother's advice, 
For one that had riches in store; 
But he's left me to roam, and his child all alone, 
To behold his proud face never more. 
For be, dm 
We ofttimes receive a 
good mother's advice 
And treat it with scorn and with pride 
From the good paths of virtue we soon go to vice. 
And still her good counsel deride. 
Onward in folly go nearer the grave, 
In shame and in poverty roam— 
k shame and in arms of a 
mother at last, 
Convinced that there is no place like home. 
For he, &c. 
ANNIE MARIA JONES. 
Of all the lovely yaller gals, 
There's none that can compare, 
With Anna Maria Joney Woney, 
Fairest of the fair ; 
She plays the fiddle, tamborine, 
The cordian, and the bones, 
And all must sink beneath the charms, 
Of Anna Maria Jones . 
Cuouus.—Anna Maria, Anna Maria, Anna Maria Jones, 
Queen of the tatnborine, the cortian and the bones, 
At the Piano sh's a 
genuine, 
She taught Miss Arabella, 
And if she plays the ophicleide, 
Prospero can't excel her, 
She plays upon the kettle- drum, 
Beats Julien on the fife, 
And plays a 
rondo on the bones, 
With a 
common fork and knife. 
Annie Maria, dm. 
She's mistress of the vocal art, 
Like Grisi, not Alboni, 
Has a 
taste br Fickabominy, 
Would cabbage from Gantona, 
But if she only raise her voice, 
And sing against the lot, 
Bones, greas, and pickles, all would go, 
Together to the pot. 
Annie Maria. Sc. 
She sings from F 
below the stave, 
To double A above, 
She quivers like a 
bumming-top, 
She warbles like a 
dove; 
And if you heard her sing A 
flat, 
'Twould teach you too C 
sharp, 
And when she sings her natur ,i1 out, 
With wonder you won .d gape. 
Annie Maria,:&c. 
All the fine arts she's a 
passion for, 
In drawing shs's au fait, 
She drew a 
badger so like life, 
The crittur ran away ; 
She's drawing, sketching, all day long, 
Wherever she may walk, 
She cannot take a 
bottle up, 
But what she draws the cork, [ Annie Maria, & c.

JAMIE'S ON THE STORMY SEA. 
E'er the twilight bat was flitting, 
In the sunset, at her knitting 
Sang a 
lonely maiden, sitting 
Underneath her threshold tree; 
And e'er daylight died before us, 
And the vesper star shone o'er us, 
Fitful rose her tender chOrus: 
Jamie's on the stormy sea. 
Warmly shone the sunset glowing, 
Sweetly breathed the young flow'rs blowing, 
Earth, with beauty overflowing, 
Seemed the home of love to be, 
As those angel's tones ascending, 
With the song and season blending, 
Ever had the same low ending: 
Jamie's on the stormy sea. 
Blow ye west winds blandly hover 
O'er the bark that bears my lover, 
Gently blow and bear him over 
To his own dear home and me; 
For, when night winds bend the wine% 
Sleep forsakes my lonely pillow, 
Thinking of the foaming billow: 
Jamie's on the stormy sea. 
How could I 
but list, but linger 
To the song, and hear the singer 
Sweetly wooing heaven to bring her 
Jamie from the stormy sea? 
And while yet her lips did name me, 
Forth I 
spring, my heart o'ereame me 
Grieve no more, sweet, I 
am Jamie, 
Home returned to love and thee.
