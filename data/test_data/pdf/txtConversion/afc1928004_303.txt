TO THE PUBLIC. 
In offering this Collection of Songs 
for the approbation of the Public, I 
beg 
leave, most respectfully, to thank my nu-
merous patrons for their kind support, 
during my career as a 
Vocalist. 
Enter-
ing in the _Musical Profession, young 
and inexperienced, I 
take the present op-
portunity of thanking you, kindly, for 
the success which has crowned my efforts. 
A success due, not so much to any supe-
rior ability on my 
part, as to the leniency 
with which, my qfforts were received. 
Hoping ever to retain the appreciation of 
my friends and patrons, I 
remain the 
Public's Most Obedient Servant, 
FRANK LEWIS, 
Vocalist. 
S.  
Dedicated, Respectfully, to my esteemed friend, 
HARRY MINER, 
Business Manager of VoLK's G
AP,DFN, New York City. 
With best wishes of tho Author,

Hurrah for the Minstrel Band! 
Dedicated to my friend HARRY: NDEESON, as a 
token of esteem. 
As sung originally by FRANK L EWIS. 
There is not a 
man in the whole Minstrel Band, 
Who would ever go back on a 
friend ; 
Tho' dark be his face, yet the black can't efface 
The kind deeds which through life him attend. 
I 
hear the trumpet sounding, sounding. 
In notes loud and clear through the land— 
I 
list to its voice, and it bids me rejoice ; 
Then hurrah for the Minstrel Band ! 
Then Hurrah ! then Hurrah ! 
Then hurrah for the Minstrel Band! 
I 
will speak first of one.who we loved in the past, 
He'd a 
heart that was noble and brave— 
Nelse Seymour, who never refused his last dime, 
If he thought you from hunger a'twould save. 
I 
hear his praises sounding, sounding, 
In notes loud and clear through the land ,— 
The tall Son of York, he died at his work, 
And the pride of the Minstrel Band ! 
And the pride !— and the pride ! 
And the pride of the Minstrel Band! 
Brave Unsworth, he stood like a 
Minstrel so true I 
'Till defeated at last by grim death ; 
And Bud-worth, alas! broke his old banjo string, 
Which he loved ' till he parted with breath. 
I 
hear their dirge now sounding, sounding, 
In notes loud and clear through the land. 
They lived and they died with the Boys that they lov'd, 
The dear Boys ot the Minstrel Band ! 
The Dear Boys 
the Dear Boys! 
The Dear Boys of the Minstrel Band! 
But now I 
must speak of the Prince of them all--
Who is that but our own gallant DO.'n! 
Let every one mourn or our Chieftan is gone— 
Dan Bryant! the Minstrel and Man! 
I 
hear his praises sounding, sounding, 
In notes loud and clear through the land. 
He lived and he died, both our glory and pride ; 
He was King of the Minstrel Band! 
He was King! he was King! 
He was King of the Minstrel Band! 
THE WASHINGTON BALL. 
Dedicated to my friend TOMMY TURNER, of the 3 
Turner Bros. 
AS Sung by FRANK LEWIS, originally, at Fox's American Thea-
tre, Philaddphia, with great success. 
A 
comical story I 
am going to tell you, 
And I 
know it will please if you listen to me. 
I 
attended a 
party in Washington City, 
And 
mention a 
few of the sights I 
did see. 
. was a 
Ball that was t 
iven to Moody and Sankey, 
Of which Mayor Wickam the figures d 
d 
Mysel f, Governor Tilden, and Barnum's What s 
It, 
We formed the first set, at the Washington Ball. 
We ah took a 
snifter when each dance was over, 
'Till getting excited, they quick came to blows. 
Tho British Ambassa dor went for Dom Pedro, 
And received for his trouble a 
bang on the nose. 
Mr. Senatoi Thurman, he then got entangled 
With sweet Mrs Tilton, while arranging her shawl; 
And our great Tony Pastor, he bursted his boiler. 
Too fat for to dance, at the Washington Ball. 
Vice President Ferry he then did get *7.-"erry 
He borrowed a 
dime from a 
fierce looking chap ; 
He said, from his stealings, he soon would repay t, 
When an Agent he was made by Mr. Belknap. 
Tennie Claflin was seen squeezing Blair in the corner ; 
Mr. Beecher shed tears a 
she kissed them all; 
Bessie Turner took a 
cocktail, she said 'twas to warm her, 
And that statted the fight at the Washington Ball! 
Miss Kate Fields gave a 
Lecture on Nursing the Baby, 
She said Brigham Young was the bist of them all; 
She grasped Lester Wallack by the tip of his whiskers, 
And she shook the black dye from hit, moustache and all. 
The Congressmen, drunk, they lay under the table 
In a 
knot, tied together, both little and tall; 
Mr. Moody gave Sankey a 
kick in the stomach, 
Just to keep up the fun, at the Washington Balk 
Col. Fred. Grant drew his sword for the first time in battle, 
Ho as- ed when the fight - -as going to begin; 
He said many a 
scrimmage he had in Chicago, 
When he went there so boldly, his young wife to win. 
Boss Sheppard then ran in to stop all the fighting; 
Mrs. Marsh, she threatened to blow on them all. 
She arid she'd report them to the Smelling Committee! 
And that put an end to the Washington Ball,

THE HONEST WORKING CLASSES 
An Original Song by Mr. FRANK LEWIS. 
How the world has wrote the pr aises of our politicans of fame, Sir— 
And bails and suppers given them in honor of their name, Sir. 
The 1 
oets, too, have sung of them, and such kind favor passes ; 
But none have sung in praise of our honest working classes. 
There's many a 
battle has been won by those who get no thanks Sir; 
The tide of vict ory oft been turned by the solid poor man's rank Sir: 
Where would they be, these nabubs and dictators of the masses, 
If it was not for the solid votes of our honest working classes. 
The honest, brown face working man, with his hands so tough and 
hard, Sir, 
A 
trudging to his daily toil, is the noblest work of God, Sir. 
No Duke's or Earl's fine silver plate, e'er equals or surpasses 
The homely, plain tin dinner pails of our honest working classes. 
Now, I 
think it would be about as well, for those high up in office, 
To try andliell77t`he poor man. tn1 feed his empty coffers— 
Take the money that they spend for w:ne, big suppers and fine 
dashes, 
And feed the starving chi dren of our hcnest working classes. 
There's the newsboys and the bootblacks, often sick, poor and for. 
loin, Sir, 
They meet the ignorant snob's contempt, the haughty rich man's 
scorn Sir; 
But some may go to Congress. and there control the masses— 
A 
noble representative of our honest working classes. 
Now, there are good men, brave and true, who represent our nation 
And who will not be offcnded at any insinuations : 
There are some, by deeds have earned their names, not by gold or 
clink of glasses, 
But have nobly risen, step by step, from our honest working classes

Endinent Men we Have and Have Not. 
As Sung Originally at the Olympic Theatre, N. 
Y. 
BY FRANK LEWIS. 
Now a 
few days ago while on things ruminating, • 
I 
thought of the present, I 
th tight of the past. 
I 
thought of the strange things we're es ery day meeting, 
And to tell you my meaning shall now be my task. 
We have not Patrick Henry, who spoke for our freedom ; 
We have rot Lafayette, who from France came to fight— 
But we have Mr. Grant and his many relations, 
Who would like a 
third term, just to set matters right. 
We have not General Geo. Mead, Gettysbur,gh's Hero, 
But we have the brave Sherm n, wno marched to the Sea. 
We have not Geo. Peabody, the poor man's true friend— 
But his name in our memory ever shall be. 
We have lost poor Jim Fist, who sent food to Chicago, 
When the fire fiend upon tiv m made such a 
great raid; 
But we have Moody and Sankey, who set weak people cranky, 
And send you to Glory, all stamped and prepaid. 
We have lost Mr. Lincoln, who gave the slaves Freedom! 
But we have Jay Cooke, who took from the bank all the tin; 
And we have our gallant Phil Sheriden, Winchester's great Hero. 
He strove for his country bright laurels to win. 
We have lost our Great'Father, our pride and our glory, 
Our Washingtai, who from our hearts shall ne'er fade: 
But we have gallant Little Mac, who at Antietam fighting, 
Quite proved that in battle he was not afraid. 
Ben Franklin has left us, and Henry Clay also; 
Ben Butler's still with us, one eye on the spoons— 
And iBatt-nam Young still keeps a

And hiE; life he's still sending in sweet honeymoons. 
`Arzott--._ we'vo lost tho brave leaders who won for us Freedora, 
And Lie stars in cmr banner so firmly did fix, 
Yet, in

We remembered the Heroes of Old ' 76.

THE BELL OF INDEPENDENCE, 
As Sung Originally by FRANK LEWIS, at Fox's American Theatre foil 
eight weeks, with tumultuous applause. 
In the days of Glorious Washington, our fathers, brave, did try, 
To raise our Starry Banner up in triumph, to the sky; 
And how they fought, and how they won, has history not told? 
The noble deeds which they have wrought, those heroes great and 
bold 
There is not a 
nation in the world but now respects our cause, 
And shrinks in 'fear from' Uncle Sam when Freedom's sword he 
draws. 
From North to South, from East to West, his mandates they obey, 
And all have joined to celebrate our Great Centennial Day. 
CTIORUS. 
Then let the Bell its story tell, 
That Bell we love so dear; 
It rang its peal in ' 76 
And our Centennial Year. 
Our Gallant Tars upon the deep shall hear its merry peal; 
Our noble s,,Idiers in the West its joyful tones shall feel. 
The Lamp shall hang from the old *mull Church in Boston's ancient 
town; 
And Paul Revere, devoid of fear, shall ride the red coats clown. 
Brave Allen o'er again shall take the fort-at Lake Champlain; 
And Putnam ride his foaming steed swift down those steps again ! 
The Minute Men once more shall arm. the Beacon Fire will ligh.,; 
And Washington shall stand aloft and bless the joyful sight

LATE TELEGRAM SONG, 
As Sung Originally by Mr. Fiaa.Nz LEWIS. 
I 
am going to sing a 
little song, if you'll listen unto me, 
I 
have all the late dispatches that have come o'er land and sea: 
There are some will make you sob and cry, and others make you laugh 
The many funny messages sent through my telegraph. 
The Fenians have conquered Holland, old Turkey's taken sick; 
They've made an Indian Princess of our good old friend Queen Vic. 
They're impeaching Mr. Belknap, because his Agents tried 
To find how long ' twould take to starve a 
soldier, ere he died. 
Dom Pedro's caught the measles from off the Prince of Wales; 
Ward Beecher has joined the Mormons, so quietness prevails. 
Fred Grant has killed old Sitting Bull, he's earned his monthly pay: 
He left his Pop in Washington, he couldn't stay away : 
The Italian nation have come o'er, they would rather work than beg; 
They spend their time in emptying out each Dutchman's lager keg. 
Boss Tweed has been discovered, a 
strange thing you will say; 
He was shoveling garbage from the scows to fill up New York Bay, 
The working men rue still crushed down beneath reformer's power; 
They manage just to starve themselves on 20 cents an hour. 
Prince Bismark has a 
Baby, he's now left in the lurch; 
The ladies sweet of Boston town, have bought the old South Church, 
Billy Wickham shaved his whiskers off, Dan Drew his debts has paid, 
Dr. Dix has learned the Can-Can along with Whitelaw Reid, 
Ben Butler's lest his larboard eye, so he can see no more; 
'Twas found in Mike Norton's chowder pot, on Coney Island shore. 
Harry Hill has joined the T. A. B. ' s, along with Peter Dwyer; 
The cow has broken loose again that caused the Chicago fire. 
Count Johannes and Doctor Landis have got into a 
fight; 
As to sea which of the two can play the ghost of Hamlet right. 
Sammy Tilden soon will married be and have some babies born; 
He proposed to Susan Anthony, Tennie Claftin and Kate Thorn s 
Mr. Belzebub's arrived in town to visit Uncle Sam; 
And what his business is I'll tell in my next Telegram.

SCENES ON THE BOWERY. 
Dedicated to Mn. H ARRY M INER, of Yolk's Garden. 
An Original Song, as Sung by FRANK DEwis, with im-
mense success. 
I 
have been thro' the streets in each City 
In Germany, EngIan and Rome ; 
But the street on v, h 
ch I 
ye made this ditty, 
Is the pride of them all here at home. 
From the pole to the gre it net y 
legions, 
Where the an in its fierceness is seen, 
There is nought like he Bowery for pleasure, 
And in all the gr,at places I've been. 
CHORUS. . 
They may talk of the pleasures of Pang, 
'I he buildings you see in Berlin; 
The remains of Solomon's Great Temple. 
But the Bowery I 
would rather live in. 
Of course we don't do the Grand Opera, 
- 
With gloves and a 
spy-glass to peep; 
Nor our gents part their hair in the middle, 
And appear like Sankey's lost, sheep, 
But you bring your dear wife or your sweetheart, 
Your sister or mother—with glee, 
You enjoy a 
good song and some lager, 
The Bowery' the place, boys, for me. 
They may talk, Sze, 
J 
e 
the Homestead of mighty Frank Duffy, 
And our great Barry Howard, so brave ; 
The place where he risked his life boldly, 
When the child from the fire be did cave. 
'Tis the home of Ton Hamblin and Ruby, 
The triumph of Fox as a 
clown; 
The place Tony Pastor coined money, 
And made his big hit in the town. 
They may talk, &c. 
'Tis the spot Barney Williams appeared in, 
Our Lingard, and many of the rest; 
And our New York's Great favorite, Gus Williams, 
Vi hoke efforts were crowned with success. 
We have not the Swells as Oh Broadway, 
Nor the damsels of fashion you'll see; 
But for bright eyes and sons of hard labor, 
They can't beat the Old Bowery. 
They may talk, 4t c.

I'll Laugh! And that's Always the' 
Last of It. 
Original Music by PROF. JAS. KENNEDY. 
Sung- 
by Mn. 
FRANK LEtvis, at Fox's Theatre, Philadelphia. 
'Tis my maxim in life to aS oid care and strife, 
And to walk through this xt orld with a 
smile; 
How I 
pity the man, who to laugh never can, 
Has no joy his sad hours to beguile 
Let us live by the w 
iy, think how short is our stay. 
Do not waste time with foolish repining, 
You will act a 
wise part if you take to your heart, 
Every bright ray of light that is shining. 
CHORUS. 
So a 
fig for despair, I 
will drive away care, 
I 
regret not my life what is past , f 
it; 
If sorrow draws nigh, to de.eat it I'll try; 
I'll laugh I 
atn1 that's the last of it. 
If the girl that I 
love, she should false to me prove, 
Do you think I 
would sit down and cry— 
No I 
I 
would start out anew, other dear ones pursue, 
And to live out my trouble. wou:d try. 
I'd keep a 
stiff upper lip ; never give up the ship, 
The sad wrinkles of woe c 
ver scorning; 
Though dense be the shroud of a 
darkening cl oud, 
'Tis dispelled by the sunlight of morning. 
So a 
fig for despair, &c. 
Did I 
once trust a 
friend and was wronged in the end, 
Still the swet t 
cup of joy I 
would cyair; 
And if trouble it came, not a 
soul w uld I 
blame, 
But my manhood I'd rouse wi ii a 
laugh; 
Not a 
tear would I 
shed, but be jay instead, 
For sorrow I 
never could ber ow; 
I'd with patlence abide, ' till the turn of +he tide, 
And the bright sun it shone on the moriOw:" 
So a 
fig for despair, &a.

Must We then Meet as Strangers? 
Words by GEO. COOPER. 
Musk by J. R. 
THOMAS. 
Copyrighted and Published by C. H. DrrsoN 87 Co. ill B'way, N. Y. 
Price 40 Cents. 
Must we then meet as strangers, 
After our dreams of joy? 
Oh ! must the love we plighted 
One bitter word destroy? 
Life without thee were lonely; ) 
Thou art my spirit's sigh ; 
,33id not affection's roses 
Wither and fade and die. 
0 
must the love we plighted 
One heedless word destroy? 
Must we then meet as strangers; 
After our dreams of joy ? 
Can we then meet as strangers, 
When we recall the past ? 
Will not its beauteous vision 
Deathless in mem'ry last ? 
Give me the smiles of gladness 
Once I 
could fondly claim : 
Whisper with sweet affection,— 
Whisper that once loved name 
0, must the love we plighted 
One heedless word destroy? 
Must we then meet as strangers, 
After our dreams of joy? 
Many Things that Ought not to Be: 
An Original Song by FRANK LENris. 
As sung by him 
at Fox's Theatre, Philadelphia. 
There is not a 
di y 
as we pass thro' this life, 
And I 
think you will with me agree, 
There a 
re many mistakes in this world we do meet, 
And things that ought not to be. 
Is it right that a 
soldier who fought in the war, 
And lost, perhaps an arm or a 
leg, 
Should grind a 
hand-organ to please passers by, 
And for food, on our charity beg ? 
CHORUS. 
These thin- s 
should be stopped in this great land of ours, 
Where every man boasts lie is free; 
So I 
thought I'd tell you, by words in my song, 
Many things that ought not to be. 
IS 
it right that each Savings Dank always should break, 
And the depositors receive not a 
dime ; 
Is it right, the ladies, striped stockings should wear, 
Aud knock us poor men out of time. 
Is it right a 
poor workman should wear out his life, 
And earn but one sixty a 
day, 
While some roll in riches, big sinecures hold ? 
These are things that ought not to be. 
These things should be, &C. 
Is it right that our army it should be cut down 
To save but a 
dollar or two; 
Was it right to send Custer and a 
few hundred men, 
To be killed by the wild Iudian foe; 
Is it right to mix silver with copper and brass, 
And give it to us to make Change; 
Is it right to let Spain still give us the laugh. 
When the Virginius we've yet to revenge ? 
These things should be, S,:e. 
Is it right that the White House should bear the name 
Of Headquarters! where swindles are done; 
Where they steal all they can from a 
poor soldier's food, 
To a 
barrel of whiskey or rum; 
Is it right, when we've millions of acres to spare, 
And all the whole world we could feed, 
That a 
man should be poor, in this great laud of ours, 
For which our brave fathers did bleed? 
These things should be, &O.

THE BUSY B'S, 
An Original Song, as Sung by FRANK LEWIS, with im-
mense success. 
A 
strange name for my song I've selected, 
But still I 
will try you to please; 
They are men of bad deeds been suspected, 
And I'll call: them the great Busy Ifs. 
Now its simply because that same letter, 
Is the one that commences their name; 
So I 
took it for want of a 
better— 
They are men of renown and great fame. 
CHORUS. 
Now Belzebub was the first B, sir, 
He made Eve steal the fruit from the tree, sir; 
Caused mankind its shame first to see sir, 
He was the most wonderful B. 
Belshazzar one day gave a 
dinner, 
And invited his Senators, all; 
But he found he was scarcely a 
winner, 
When the writing appeared on the wall. 
Brigham Young gets his wives by the hundred, 
He's babies, I'm told, by the score; 
But not satisfied, the old rascal, 
He is constantly wishing for more. 
Cnonus. 
Ben Butler with one eye does see sir— 
He goes that same eye on a 
fee sir— 
He is a 
most comical B, sir, 
That ever this nation did see. 
Mr. Beecher, to the people still preaches, 
Giving sly winks at each pretty Miss; 
Henry Bowen says- bad things he teaches 
He is best at a 
sweet fragrant kiss. 
gipain speaks of apologies given— 
Will that bring the dead back to life? 
Will that aid the wives and the children 
Of the victims who fell in the strife? 
CHORUS. 
We want Burril, the butcher, on high, sir, • 
On a 
gibbet that shall reach the sky, sir 
Like the men he has murdered, to die, sir; 
Not till then will we listen to Spain. 
Mr:Blaine is a 
B 
that was Speaker, 
He hails from away down in Maine; 
For the chair in the White House, a 
seeker, 
No fool of a 
B, was old Blaine. 
Mr. Babcock, the gay and the frisky, 
Is a 
B 
that went in for the tin; 
He made his small pile out of whiskey— 
But stealing by law is no sin. 
CHORUS. 
Boss Tweed and Boss Shephard, so great, sir, 
Made cash at a 
tremendous rate, sir; 
Our currency went to inflate, sir— 
These men were such Busy B's. 
But the worst B 
of all in the nation, 
Who late did his pockets well fill— 
Is the one from the poor soldier's ration 
Did steal what he could at Fort Sill. 
Aaron Burr, we are told, was a 
Traitor— 
For his country he did not care a 
rap; 
Though, peihaps his proud soul did hate her— 
Was he worse than our General Belknap? 
Cnonos. 
Such men you'll agree with me, sir, 
A.re a 
disgrace to the land of the free, sir; 
'Tis in prison they all ought to be, sir, 
These wonderful great Busy B's,

LEWIS' GREAT ALPHABET SONG. 
As Sung by him with Great Success. 
A stands for alphabet, which we learned in school. 
stands for Beecher and old Sitting Bull! 
And for Belknap, who lately they tried to impeach. 
C stands for Custar! he 2harged on the foe, 
And died where the Big Horn's dark waters flow! 
And D is the the Dufferin ! the Yacht that we beat. 
And E is old England, which we did always defeat. 
The c.mntry which Miss Emma Mine went to cheat. 
Now F is Young Farragut! who nailed to the mast, 
The Flag of his country, so firm and so fast. 
And Fox the great Clown, we have lost evermore. 
And G stands for Garner ! who gave up his life 
On board the Mohawk, for to save his dear wife. 
And II stands for Horace, the gr_atest and best! 
Who told all the people they'd better go West! 
And I 
for old Ireland! that gem of the sea. 
J 
is John Morrissey, the workingman's friend ; 
And K is King Pedro! who home we did send. 
And L is Liberty! for which we fought. 
11 is a 
Morman, who ten wives can stand! 
N is Napoleon, who found his Sedan! 
0 is Old Brigham! not lone and forlorn — 
For to him each morn a 
baby is born! 
And P the Prince of Wales, who went Tigers to shoot. 
41 is Queen Victoria! an Empress now made. 
It is bold Reno! of the foe not afraid; 
He fought the red demons as a 
soldier should fight. 
And S 
is the Surplus there never will be, 
'Till the poor man on Sunday the big show can see. 
T is Tom Scott ! he's of Railroads ! he King. 
U is Ulysses! the Chief of the Ring ! 
But he'll soon leave the White House, which will be a 
big 
thing. 
V that is Virtue, a 
thing now forgot; 
Go search the world over and you'll find it not; 
Our Congressmen, certain, did out the name blot. 
But W stands for a 
man with a 
name, 
The greatest of all, in the Temple of Fame !— 
Ho braved every tyrant, our freedom he won— 
God bless him, forever, our ewn Washington.! 
The bravest of all since the world it begun. 
X stands for example, if you leave out the E. 
And Y the Young Ladies, who around me I 
see— 
At the bottom of most trouble they are always the cause. 
And Z is the Zenith of all things—the end— 
Which a 
man surely feels if he has not a 
friend. 
And now that I've sung my Alphabet through, 
I, for your kind attention, respectfully thank you, 
And I 
hope I've deserved your kind applause, 
Welcome Song to the Centennial. 
Sung Originally by Mr. FRANK LEWIS, at Fox's Theatre. 
Up, up, with the banner of Freedom, 
Which a 
Century ago was unfurled; 
And now we'll invite every nation 
To join in ouryoy through the world. 
And France that 41. ar country we'll w,lcome, 
That gave us the grea Lafayette; 
And ; reland's sweet & finer, we'll gx, et it— 
Patrick Henry we ne'er can forget. 
CHORUS. 
We will welcome the world to our standard, 
Let them come o'er mom tam n

Up, up, with the banner of Freedom, 
To England we'll give warm our hand;

Let Russia. each stout son send over, 
And come from each ice covered plain; 
Let us not forget that Columbus, 
He sprung from the dear land of Spain. 
We will welcome the world, &c. 
Up, up, with the banner of Freedom,

IT'S ONLY A 
QUESTION OF TIME. 
An Original Song by FRANK LEWIS. 
In the battle of life, if you would win in the strife, 
Should you fail at the start, try again: 
Keep a 
stiff upper lip, never give up the ship, 
Sunshine always comes after r 
ain. 
Whatever you do, strive to push your way through, 
And keep this sound maxim in mind, 
Fortune favors the brave, she'll yet come to your aid— 
It is only a 
question of time, 
Cuouns. 
So, if for a 
fortune or fame you may strive 
Or a 
wife suited just to your mind : 
Go in with a 
will, your time will come still— 
It is only a 
question of time. 
Our Conductors are fond of milk punches, they say; 
But the Bell Punches, they made them sick, 
For the Spotters discovered their secret machines, 
They rang under their arms with a 
click. 
Now, the secret is out, and their pickings they miss : 
Knocking down's almost ceased on our lines; 
But somotYankee will invent an improvement on this— 
It is only a 
question of time. 
Cuoiars. 
Directors are sharp, but Conductors are fly, 
They have got these things down pretty fine; 
They will soon punch this Bell Punch, and send it sky high 
It is only a 
quest'on of time. 
My 
friend Jones has been married fie years now or so; " 
lie's the father of five—so they say— 
But what's strange to relate and curious to know, 
I 
have not one, though I 
pray. 
But my spother.in-law says, now don't you despair, 
Fight it out, my boy, ou that same line 1 
Dame Nature will be good to you never fear— 
It is only a 
question of time. 
Cams. 
Now I 
give this advice as it was given to me,' 
If your family affairs are like mine', 
If your house has no heir, why never despair— 
It is only a 
question of time,

THE AMERICAN FLAG. 
Mn. Frwric LEwis' Great Originql Song, as Sung by him 
over 100 times, in New York and Philadelphia. 
Wonderful that glorious emblem, boys, the banner of the free, 
The stars and stripes which brightly wave, supreme o'er land and sea 
It floated proud when nations tried to drag it through the mire, 
It filed brave men in every clime with patr.otic fire. 
It shed its radiance through the world on Concord's Village Green I 
Wherever Liberty, it shines, that emblem can be seen. 
It stood on Bunker's Mountain Coast, where Warren nobly died, 
And in the cause of Freedom boys, it all the world defied. 
It spread its folds at Valley Forge, ' mid storm of rain and snow; 
It floated proud at Trenton, boys, where prostrate lay the foe; 
O'er Washington it placed its wings, as in the boat he stood, 
When bold the Delaware he crossed, and braved its angry flood. 
It brightly waved at DAlymount, when Gildersleeve he shot; 
When Bodine, Fulton, and the rest, the golden prizes got; 
And when the Cumberland went down ' mid screams of wild despair, 
It proudly floated o'er the wreck, undaunted still was there. 
ts folds protected Sheridan when he did swiftly ride; 
-It went with Sherman to the sea, when he to conquer tried. 
Defending it young Ellsworth fell, and free without a 
stain. 
It spread out its victorious stripes with Scott at Lundy's Lane, 
It went with Rough and Ready against a 
foreign foe; 
Its shadow spread destruction o'er the plains of Mexico: 
'And down with Jackson, in the South, behind his cotton bales, 
That starry emblem was unfurled 'till victory prevailed. 
21 
It floats on every foreign shore, our own beloved flag! 
And curses light on him, my boys, who low its folds would drag; 
On sea, that emblem, far and wide, is worshipped by our tars; 
On land each Freedom's loving San does bless its Stripes and Stars! 
But brighter, boys, it ne'er did shine, than when the people all, 
Met on the Fourth of last July, in Independence Hall— 
And raised that banner to the clouds w;th loud triumphant cry— 
That just one hundred years had passed, since it did the world defy. 
THE ACTOR'S GREAT BALL. 
An Original Song by PRANK LEWIS. 
As sung by him 
With Great Success. 
A 
comical story Pm going to tell you, 
I 
wrote it to please both toe great and the small; 
It's about some good fun I 
had in this City, 
One night at the Actor's Professional Ball. 
The first set of Quadrilles was danced by Tony Pastor, 
Of which Clara Morris the figures did call. 
Mr. Daly and Pique waltzed round faster and faster— 
There was fun, you can bet at the Actor's treat Ball! 
Josh Hart brought his Eagle to fly at the party, 
John Brougham a 
kiss from Miss Neilson he toot! 
Lester Wallack, he shaved off his whiskers, and gave them 
Unto the two Orphans of Sheridan Shook. 
Mr. Levy, he played on his Cornet, a 
Solo, 
As he sat in the Crucible of Oakey Hall! 
Pat Rooney and Harry Bennett, to enliven the meeting, 
Danced the Tra-la-loo, at the Actor's Great Ball. 
Jennie Engle appeared with her flags used in singing, 
And Sol Smith Russell commenced for to blow. 
Harry Hill's Female Boxers wentin to fling him. 
To the place underneath, where all Actors do go. 
Then Kelly and Leon wentin rough and tumble, 
Tore Leon's new dress, which cost thousands, he'll say. 
Gus Williams got his steam up and bursted his boiler, 
And John Hart, the skeleton, he fainted away. 
Billy pastor then tried to waltz with Miss Markham, 
But his body was lar e 
and his legs they were small— 
So he got the two Brahams to drop all their H's, 
They tripped up Jennie Hughes, her sweet vocals and all. 
Anna Dickinson then danced, her crown of thorns wearing. 
Which gave to the critics an unmerciful shock. 
While Jarrett Ev. Palmer made Tooker keep swearing— 
There was no boat afloat like the great Plymouth Rock! 
As daylight approached, the fun kept increasing; 
Mr. Theodore Moss called his Jockey a 
fool— 
Then Boucicault came in with a 
play he had stolen, 
And closed up the da% lights of friend John F. Poole. 
Just then occurred what you would call a 
commotion; 
Rate Claxton had Fannie Davenport Pinned ' gainst the wall. 
Harrigan & Hart then appeared in their unequalled effusions, 
And that put an end to the Actors Great Ball!

AIITTLE MORE OlDtit TOO. 
I

And I

I

But now old age came creeping, 
We grow down and don't get bigger; 
And cider sweet and sour then,

She am de apple of my soul, 
And I'm bound to be beside her.

MASSA'S KITCHEN FLOOR, 
As sung by JOIINSO.T & Bnux.o. 
Two old Virginia Niggers, 
Ton musn't think we're green; 
When working on the Steamboat 
On the Mississippi stream, 
We used to tote the cotton bales, 
And heave the plank ashore; 
And often spend our money 
On the Old Virginia shore. 
CHORUS. 
Two lightning, colored Mokes, [ Break 
From Old Virginia shore. [ Break 
[Repeat 
And now we'll show you how we dance 
On old Massa's kitchen floor. 
When on the old platation, 
Us darkies held our sway; 
We'd sing and dance from morn to night, 
And on the Banjo play; 
We'd pick the cotton, hoe the corn, 
Anal when our work was o'er; 
Then all together we would dance 
On llasa's kitchen floor.

MY OLD KENTUCKY HOME. 
Itusic, with Piano Forte Accompaniment, published by J. C. Becket. 
Philadelphia. 
LONG, how I 
long, for my home in Kentuck, 
With its fields where I 
labored, so green. 
Where the possum and the coon, and the juicy wild duck, 
And the ' bacca so prime. I 
have seen: 
There I've fished from the banks of the Masella creek, 
And oft, in the shade of the night, 
Have I 
watched with my gun, nigh the old Salt Lick. 
For the game as it come to my sight. 
Cnonus. 
There is my old cabin home, 
There is my sisters and brother, 
There is my wife, joy of my life, 
My child, and the grave of my mother; 
That lint, my dear home, my log cabin home, 
With the bench that I 
stood at the door, 
Where, weary at night, from my work I 
would come, 
And there rest. ere I 
stepped on its floor. 
The calabash vine, that then clung to its walls, 
Oh! ' tis dear in my memory still to me; 
And my master, who lives in his own handsome halls, 
r
,Tot so happy as then I 
could be. 
There is, &c.. 
But that cabin is fir, far away from me now, 
I 
am far from the scenes that I 
love, 
Tar away from that wife who once heard me vow 
That forever I 
faithful would prove— 
My friends are still there, and still there is my child, 
And still there, all in life, I 
most crave— 
still there is that mound, with its flowers so wild, 
That covers my old mother's grave. 
There is, &t,

THE PATRIOT'S DREAM. 
Copyrighted 1876, and Music Pub. E. H. 
HARDING, 2'29 Bowery, N. T 
Written and adapted by FRANK LEWIS, 
One morn when thinking o'er events, 
In our Central Park so great, 
On a 
rustic bench I 
sat, 
O'er things to ruminate ; 
When sleep o'ercame me for a 
time, 
A 
dense mist did arise ; 
A 
panorama of strange forms 
Did pass before my eyes! 
I 
raised aloft my wond'ring gaze, 
It seemed to pierce the clouds. 
As by me pa.ss'd, in strange array, 
A 
great and bustling crowd. 
I 
notic'd each familiar face, 
And marked each stirring scene, 
The record of a 
hundred years— 
I 
saw them in my dream. 
The fog to me it cleared away, 
There came a 
brilliant light. 
And as a 
Keystone to the Arch 
Thete shone a 
rainbow bright! 
And in the centre Freedom stood, 
Aloft — she rais'd her hand— 
And pointed, as they pass'd me by, 
Tint ) the patriot band! 
I 
saw the men cf Boston march, 
So noiseless to the Sea, 
To strike the Keynote of our fame, 
And overthrow the tea; 
And then I 
saw them swiftly go 
To Concord's distant town, 
Where low the Union Jack did droop, 
By Freedom's sons east down. 
I 
next saw Lafayette embark 
To cross the raging main; 
Saw Warren lying stark and stiff, 
When in the battle slain; 
, 
fiaw:Putnam...I.ide.414 gEitUailt.atged 
k. May down those 141aira,,aci 
And VraShintROn. upon the ice 
Of Delaware. adrift 
I 
next did see our gallant boys 
In Valley Forge, forlorn ; 
And still their hearts with patriot fire 
Defied the wintry storm; 
Then came upon my vision 
A 
dark cloud in the sky— 
It was the traitor, Arnold 
That in shame was passing by. 
A 
ray of light the cloud dispelled, 
As Paulding glided by 
With Major Andre in his grasp, 
As he went forth to die! 
Saw Jefferson the paper write, 
Which made us slaves no more! 
Our gloriCkii; Constitution, bo3s ! 
As wrote in days of yore: 
Saw Lincoln sign the Freedom 
Of all men throughout the land! 
And Ethan Allen take the Fort, 
By Lake Champlaine does stand; 
Saw Jackson with his cotton bales, 
Defy the invading foe; 
And Taylor I 
old our banner up 
Way down in Mexico. 
But at this moment I 
awoke, 
As loud a 
bell did ring, 
And saw unto the breeze our Flag 
Its graceful emblem fling! 
I 
saw old Independence ball, 
So bright in the Luia's ray, 
As Hancock to the people spoke, 
•• 'Tis our Centennial Day !" 
And all the spirits of my dream 
Did join in joyful cry— 
This is the y-ar of Seventy-Six— 
The Fourth day of July! 
And sweet Olumbia far above, 
She pointed down with pride 
Unto our Flag. and proudly said— 
" 
It nas the world defigd l"

THE ACROBATIC NIGS. 
Written expressly for Joassos & BRUNO, by H. BFNNBTL 
Oh! dancing is a 
happy occupation, 
No matter whether dancing reels or jigs; 
But if you want to see a 
big sensation, 
Cast your optics on these Acrobatic Nigs; 
We learned our dancing down in Alabama, 
Where all de darkies sing and crack their jokes, 
But if you want to burst yourself with laughter, 
Watch de motion of dese Indian Rubber Kokes.

We're sure to make you think you are in Heaven 
For your troubles, boys, you will not care a 
fig; 
Oh! watch us while we sling these number 'leyens. 
We are double-breasted Acrobatic Nigs. 
Oh I 
the boys were always jealous of these darkies, 
Because they couldn't sling themselves around; 
Oh! we used to set de Piccaninnies crazy, 
Two others, like us, never could be found; 
And often our old Massa used to wonder, 
And many times we've seen him shake his fist; 
For it used to make him just as mad as thunder, 
To watch us while we done our double-twist. 
We're sure to make you, ete,

One evening sweet thoughts were over me cre,eping, 
I 
thought upon my sweetheart I 
would call, 
And while in her window slyly peeping, 
I 
saw something that did my heart opal, 
Her teeth and one eye laid upon the table, 
Her pretty curls hung on a 
wooden peg, 
So I 
laughed as hard and loud as I 
was able, 
To see her talking off a 
wooden leg.

SONGS OF "UNCLE TOM'S CABIN." 
As sung by Mr. ROLL.DT HOWARD, in his unequaled fe.cdi-
tion of ' 
St. Clair," in that famous Drama, 
throughout America. 
" 
ST. CLAM TO EVA." 
Childless, desolate this heart, 
Naught on earth is left to cherish, 
Every hope and joy must part— 
Every hope and joy will perish. 
Eva, Eva! charming daughter, 
Smile upon me from above; 
Open wide those gates of pearl, 
Bless me with thy Heavenly love; 
Art thou gone from me forever ? 
Shall I 
nevermore behold thee ? 
Oh! my heart and soul's affection, 
What is now this world to me? 
Home is silent, dread and drear, 
Uncle Tom is seen to weep ; 
Topsy lingers near thy bier, 
Strewing roses at thy feet. 
Eva, Eva! lovely daughter, 
Are those sweet lips closed and cold, 
That so gently spoke of Heaven, 
Emblem of an Angel's mould? 
Angel of divine perfection, 
Loved by all, enslaved and free; 
Oh! my heart and soul's affection, 
What is now this world to me?

While the birds make music music all the day.

KENTUCKY HOME 
Sung by DAVE WALLING, in Rose's Courtship, at the Park 
Theatre, Brooklyn, N. Y. 
DE moon is shining bright now, 
As I 
sit beside de cabin door, 
I 
am thinking of de old folks, 
Dat lived on de old Virginny shore, 
We once was happy in de old home, 
Before old master's soul did roam, 
But now the poor darkey's have to wander, 
Far from de old Kentucky home. 
Good bye, old folks, good bye, 
Now well have to roam, 
Since master's gone and left us, 
And our old Kentucky home. 
HICKORY JACKSON 
Sting by HARRY W ESTERN, ill 
Rose's Courtship, at the 
Park Theatre, Brooklyn, N. Y. 
NOW kind friends do look at me, 
And an old man you will see, 
Just climbing sixty-nine but yesterday. 
I 
can tell you all a 
riddle. 
I 
can dance and play de fiddle, 
As in de days gone by of Henry Clay. 
Bern was de good old times, 
When you could save de dimes. 
But now (em times am gone and passed away. 
nut give me de days of old, 
And my story am soon told, 
flats when old man Hickory Jaekson had his day, 
One thing more I'd like to Say, 
Just before I 
go away, 
Of the times I 
use to have in Dixie's Land. 
I 
use to hoe de corn from de breaking of de morn, 
And many a 
cled of earth has bruised de'e,e hands. 
But when de werk was done, we darkey's had de fun, 
Old master got our jug and cleared de way, 
For de old Virginny reel, 
From de toe down to de heel, 
Data when old man Hickory Jackson had his day. 
THE OLD BACK GATE, 
Sung with great applause by W ESTERW & W ALLING, 
at Shelby's Adelphia, Buffalo, N. Y. 
HE. 
I 
WONDER where the old man's gone, 
He's been watching by the gate for me, 
I've given him the slip, so here I 
am, 
With my heart so full of glee, 
I 
love his pretty daughter Rose, 
And when she is my mate, 
He'll never catch me any more 
Knocking on his old back gate. 
I've come to meet my Rosa dear, 
By the light of the silvery moon, 
At half past eight she's to be hem, 
My own clear Rose Doon. 
Sur. 
I 
thought I 
heard my Charley's voice, 
While coming up this way, 
I guess I 
was mistaken, tho' 
I 
knew his happy lay, 
My father doesn't like him much, 
Because he stays so late, 
But Charlie's changed the trysting tree, 
Fr9rq knocking on the old baelr. goo, 
Respectfully dedicated to Johnson and Bruno, by 
HARRY BENNETT. 
WE have traveled North and South, 
And again from East to West, 
We've sipped champagne in bright and naughty France, 
We have " plowed the raging main," 
And we've been in sunny Spain, 
And with the senoritas had a 
dance, 
But there's nothing can compare 
With the pure and balmy air 
And beauty of America's free land; 
For to us it is most dear, 
And just while we're standing here, 
White folks, we're going to try to do the grand. 
CHORUS. 
Then keep your eyes upon us coons, 
We bounce around just like balloons; 
And, as we sli g 
our feet so high, 
You'll see that we're immense; 
We'll cause you one and all to cry : 
They're figs par excellence." 
Oh, We love te sing and dance 
And, whene'er we get a 
chance. 
We pivot on the light fantastic toe; 
'We are just as light as air, 
And we cause the boys to stare 
As through our evolutions we do go. 
And we captivate the girls. 
With their dark and witching curls— 
With the fair sex us nigs are number one; 
And we're sure to make them smile, 
With our easy, graceful style— 
Our dancing is to them a 
mint of fun. 
Chorus.—Then keep your eyes, dze.

I 
am thinking to-day of dem years dat pass'd away, 
When deg tied me up in bondage long ago; 
In old Virginny State, it was dar we separate, 
And it fill'd my heart with misery and woe. 
Dey took away my boy, he was his mother's joy, 
From a 
baby in de cradle we him raise; 
Oh, dey put us far apart, an' it broke de old man's heart, 
In dem agonizing, cruel slay'ry days.

Dey never come again, let us give our praise to Him, 
Who looks down whar de little children play; 
So ev'ry night and morn, we will pray for dem dat's gone, 
In dem agonizing, cruel slav'ry days. 
Still my mem'ry will steal o'er, to dat dear old cabin floor, 
When de shadow of de sun came peeping in; [ bark, 
At night, when all was dark, we would hear de watch-dog 
And we'd listen to de murmur of de wind. 
It seem to say to me, " You people must be free," 
For de happy time am coming, Lord be prais'd! 
For then we would weep and moan, for our souls were not 
our own, 
In dem agonizing, cruel slay'ry days. 
I 
am very old and feeble, and our life am nearly done, 
I 
have travel'd in the roughest kind of road; [ last, 
Thro' sickness, toil and sorrow, I 
have reach'd de end at 
And I'm resting by de wayside wid ray load. 
Forget now and forgive, has always been my guide, 
For dat's what de golden Scripture surely says ; 
But our mem'ry will tarn roan, when our souls dey wen

COME, come and be converted, 
Come from wickEdness and Si; 
Let the devil be d 
serted, 
Come and j 
in the bard within; 
Hear us preach, and hear us pray, 
Join us in each happy lay, 
While you're loose and led astray, 
Come and join the band. 
Come, come, ev'ry Yankee, 
Er'ry sinner thro' the land, 
Pray with Moody, sing with Sankey, 
Come, and :loin the band I 
Noss the glory flows around us, 
Angels blow their bugles loud, 
Sinners bless the day they found tie, 
See them creeping through the crowd. 
All the world we come to heel, 
Into every berast we steal, 
We are for the nation's weal, 
Come and join the band. 
Come, come, every Yankee, ktc. 
We have crossed the mighty ocean, 
Now we're back with glory crowned. 
We have gained the world's devotion, 
Such a 
wicked lot we found, 
From the aged and the wise, 
Severed from their sinful ties, 
We have heard repenting cries, 
When they joined the band. 
Come, come, every Yankee, &c.

Dey laid her slowly in de clay, 
She sickened and she withered like a 
flower, 
Yes, from dis weary world she's passed away, 
So I

And try hard to shuffle wid my feet.

AUNT CHLOE come to town to-day,. 
To see old Aunt Jemima, 
She come in on a 
load of hay 
With a 
big bull-dog behind her. 
She had a 
jug into the cart 
Of real old apple toddy, 
She wasn't pr aid, bless her heart, 
She'd notice anybody. 
CHORUS. 
Hurrah ! for Aunty Chloe, 
Her hair as white as snow, 
She's come to town to look around, 
To sing the jubilo. 
She had a 
bonnet on her head 
That was in the revolution, 
She had no teeth to chew her bread, 
She was tough as any Russian. 
She had a 
sorrel old gray horse, 
He had the clampus vitus, 
And when she'd holler hal-le-lu, 
He'd kick up like the riteous. 
Chorus,—Hurrah I 
When Chloe met old Jemima, 
I

She stamped her feet just like a

And hollered welcome sister. • 
'Twas joyht, joyful, hail de news, 
When Chloe told de story, 
It melted all de rubber shoes, 
Jemima shouted glory.

The N. Y. Evening hail writes: 
"A Little Book has lately appeared in print at Mr. A. J. FISHER'S, 9S Nas-
sau street ca led the ' Little Flirt." 
We cannot say that we recommend 
• 
it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, as we think it would only 
encourage the bad habit of " flirting." 
Unfortunately, there is enough 
of it done without any further necessity of explaining " how. when and 
whore to do it, 
and this little volume would advise and initiate the un-
corrupted in practicing what is commonly called "flirting." 
The N. Y.. Eeening Telegram writes: " We have lately seen a 
neat little 
book, bound in Morocco leather, costing twenty-five cents, called the 
"Little Flirt," published by A. 
J. 
FISHER, No. 98 Nassau street. 
It 
gives information of the roodus op, randi of flirting, and of the meaning 
of every motion of the handkerchief, fan, glove and parasol. 
As there 
is nothing at all objectionable in the volume, and its contents might af-
ford some innocent amusement to many, we do Lot hesitate to recom-
mend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers."

American Fortune-Telling Cards.—This is the old-

published it for years, and the demand is continually increasing. 
These Cards are arr turd and printed in series—H. arts, Clubs, Dia-
monds and Spades—and each or these into K for King. Q for Queen, 
and K 
for Knave, and numbers 1, 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
four rows, and are to he read according to directions. Many ot the an-
swers depend upon the position certain earth bear to other cards. The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under-
standing. Many professional Fortune-Tellers use these cards, and we 
are in receipt of letters in relation to them from all parts of the U. S.

Courting Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want fiequently felt by young people—a want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too din. 
dent or too fearful of a 
i 
epulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unlady-like encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many 
lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been pro.ongecl and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. Tuis pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and beiog in the shape of questions and a 
nswers. will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own. unless it accords with 
the state of their affection-, which fact makes further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties
