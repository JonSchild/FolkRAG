EMMA SNOW 
Way down in Ambama, 
hot very long ago, 
I 
knew a 
yellow charmer, 
And her name was Emma Soviet 
Tier eyes was bright as diamonds, 
And her teeth was pony white, 
Dey glisned in de darkness, 
As the stars do in the night. 
Chorus.—But that happy time is over, 
I've only grief and pain; 
For 1 
shall never, never see 
My Emma dear again. • 
We us'd to go out early 
To?hoe de sugar cane, 
The time did pass so cherily, 
When Emma Snow was seen; 
She trebled wid us daily, 
And oft would tell her name; 
And we danced and sung so gaily 
To the Banjo's sweetest strain. 
But that happy time is over, Ate 
Now that happy time bath sorrow, 
The day is turned to night; 
lost my dearest Emma, 
By the poison adder's bite 
We misted her in de eveaing, 
And we hunted far and wide, 
And we found her in the meadows, 
Whar she sieken'd and she died.
