Eastern European Easter foods, Ethnic Groceries in Cleveland, Ohio April 17, 2014 
Holidays usually bring out the best in food traditions, and that's especially true of Easter 
among most Eastern European cultures. This week, I 
had the good fortune to spend time 
in the Cleveland, Ohio area—Parma Heights and Parma, to be specific, where there are 
well established Ukrainian, Polish, and other ethnic communities. Beginning as early as 
the late 1800s and early 1900s, these neighborhoods supported grocery stores, 
restaurants, social halls, and churches that continued many food customs from the "old 
world." Today, the commercial food establishments welcome customers from a 
multiplicity of ethnicities and varieties of "American-ness," but also frequently serve as 
social centers for individuals sharing that ethnic heritage. 
This was very evident on the Wednesday before Easter. Grocery stores were packed with 
customers purchasing special meats, breads, and other treats for the up-coming holiday. 
The festive atmosphere made the shopping hectic, but it was obvious that people enjoyed 
the hustle and bustle. The crowds even overflowed to the sidewalk at State Meats on 
State Road in the Ukrainian Village in Parma, with people seated on benches or standing 
and chatting while they waited their turn to go inside to select the special hams and 
sausages used for the holiday. The small bakery down the street, Kolos Bakery, similarly 
was packed, and the owners looking harried—but pleasantly so. Their card states that 
they speak English, Ukrainian, Armenian, Russian, and Hebrew, reflecting the rich mix 
of cultures that intermingle in these neighborhoods—and around food. Further down 
State Road, the LVIV International Food Store featured Ukrainian Easter cakes, meats, 
sugar lambs and rabbits, and decorated eggs along with their usual colorful displays of 
arts, crafts, clothing, and food. 
Another Ukrainian grocery, the Ukrainian Village food and Deli, brought that home even 
more. The owner, Irena, graciously gave me an interview in the morning before the rush 
of customers began. She came to the U.S. thirteen years ago after running a 
business in 
the Ukraine for ten years. She opened her own grocery store partly because she wanted to 
work with something she knows—food—but also because she wanted to have her own 
business. Initially, the store was a 
way to make a 
living, but over the years, it has 
developed into much morea place where customers can feel comfortable learning about 
new foods as well as run into friends and develop a 
sense of community. Irena does that 
partly by hiring employees who can speak Ukrainian and English (and frequently other 
languages as well; she speaks Polish, Russian, and some Romanian, along with English 
and her native Ukrainian). She also actively supports the surrounding community, 
creating jobs and donating items to local ethnic churches. Which brings us back to the 
holiday foods. 
One of the traditions for many Catholic eastern Europeans is the blessing of food to be 
eaten for the Easter holiday. Baskets are prepared, usually containing special breads, 
hard-boiled eggs (plain and elaborately decorated), meats (frequently lamb as a 
symbol of 
Christ, pork sausages, or hams), maybe butter shaped into lambs, and other treats. The 
baskets are then blessed at church on the Saturday preceding Easter Sunday. Each 
ethnicity—and each family and regional culture—has their own variations. These 
variations are part of the richness of these traditions and suggest something of how food 
allows us to celebrate unity while also recognize diversity. In very practical terms, it 
means there's something for everyone's taste, palate, and circumstances.
