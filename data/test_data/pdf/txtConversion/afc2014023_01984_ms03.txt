Interviewee 
Introduction. Sonny Amato, taxidermist, owner of 
"Artistry of Wildlife by Sonny" a 
local taxidermy studio. 
Interviewed Feb. 11, 2015, at his home and workshop, 
Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Interviewed by Douglas 
Manger, folklorist. 
Amato 
00:00:39 
Amato started his taxidermy business in 11th grade. 
Did not hunt or fish, but his brothers did. He was 
challenged to mount his brother's harvested duck. 
(Amato prefers to use the term " harvested" rather than 
"shot" or "killed.") Found what little he could on 
taxidermy at the local library and then went to work. 
His first attempt was crude, but he kept at it. 
00:02:33 
His parent's home at the time was in north Baton 
Rouge. Amato did the actual taxidermy work in a 
metal 
building behind the house. He used his parent's living 
room for a 
studio. Amato had a 
listing in the yellow 
pages by the time he finished high school. 
00:03:15 
Taxidermy gave Amato the opportunity to use his 
hands; to exercise his determination. "Once I 
get 
started on it I 
don't let go until it's right." 
00:03:42 
Amato's brother knew a 
lot of people with money. He 
referred them to (Sonny) Amato at the outset. These 
"upper class clients" helped him get his business 
started. "They were more than willing to help me get 
along." 
00:04:53 
Amato never worked with a 
master taxidermist. 
"Actually I 
was self-taught." Determination and will 
power kept him going. Referencing photographs and 
illustrations helped (helps) him a 
great deal. 
00:05:57 
His clients love nature. Contrary to today's practice of 
putting out feed for deer at a 
feeder, when Amato first 
started in taxidermy his clients stalked the deer. 
Hunters looked for telltale signs like the scrape of a 
deer horn on a 
tree. 
00:09:16 
Change in mentality among deer hunters over time. 
Many hunters today going just for the horns. "...that 
huge rack to have bragging rights on how big of a 
deer 
they killed ... and that's where I 
come in..." 
00:09:53 
"When somebody comes in to pick up their trophy, I'm 
looking at them ... that's where I 
get my satisfaction, by 
watching their face." When their trophy is delivered, 
"boy they just, you know, they glow." 
00:10:59 
There have been dramatic changes in taxidermy 
technology over time. Today's styrofoam forms have 
transformed the industry. They are available in endless 
configurations for any mammal or fish being worked 
on. Unlike the past, today there are many how-to 
videos in the marketplace "for the younger people 
(novice taxidermists) coming on." Kits are available 
today complete with the form, eyes, whatever else you 
need to complete the specimen. " It's a 
lot easier now." 
2 
00:12:29 
With the advent of new taxidermy aids more people 
have come into the trade. Amato's clients are always 
full of questions about his techniques. Half an hour or 
more typically spent with a 
new client answering their 
questions about the work. Not a 
matter of just money. 
"That's not the way to be successful in taxidermy to 
me." It is a 
must to invest time with each client. Amato 
has been doing it so long because he cares about his 
clients as he would his friends. "You've got to have a 
friendly atmosphere and a 
clean place, too." 
00:14:37 
Amato describes his separate work areas for deer, fish, 
and birds. One of his helpers does all the skinning and 
cleaning; the other helper prepares the form. This frees 
Amato up to do the actual mounting and facial detail. 
00:15:29 
Clients "appreciate something that looks alive, and not 
like a 
stuffed animal." Amato comments that women 
now like to use the mounts as decor in the house. 
00:16:37 
Amato talks about his insistence in adhering to the 
details, like the look of the eyes. Given his study of 
references over time, "I 
can tell you every bone and 
every muscle in just about every animal that I 
have 
ever done." Amato believes the true artistry is in 
making the trophy look alive. 
00:17:54 
"Being from old school I 
like doing everything." Ducks 
are the hardest thing for Amato to do. Ducks must be 
groomed. Amato spends anywhere from one to two 
hours with a 
pair of tweezers and a 
needle putting 
every feather back in place. 
00:19:36 
Amato has been in business for over 50 years. He is 
now dealing with second, third generation family 
members whose fathers and grandfathers did business 
with him. 
00:20:41 
He speaks to the reaction of children to his showroom. 
Amato must educate them that trophies are to be 
looked at, not played with. Boy Scout troops come 
through from time to time. 
3 
00:22:14 
"Old school" taxidermists had nothing but the animal to 
work with. They had to construct the form. Today's 
taxidermists simply look in a 
reference catalogue to 
order in what they need. The result is a 
significant 
reduction in labor hours. It was difficult to recoup your 
time- in in the old days. " Love of doing it is what kept 
me there and in the long run it paid off," Amato 
comments. One can definitely tell "Old School" from 
"New School" work. With all his added experience up 
to today, Amato remarks, there is "not going to be 
nowhere near the comparison." Amato does not turn 
anything lose until he is absolutely satisfied. 
His father was a 
jeweler. Very business like, Amato 
models his father's approach to this day in the way he 
00:26:15 
engages his clients. He also learned the art of making 
the sale by observing his father. Although his father 
wanted Amato to make sculptured jewelry, he had no 
interest. 
Creating something back to nature is the hook for 
00:27:45 
Amato. "Getting that live look to it. That's my passion. 
To make it so real, that if you touch a 
duck, it wants fly 
off." 
His two brothers also influenced Amato. Both hunters, 
they brought specimens back from hunting trips for 
00:28:15 
Amato to practice on. Without those Amato would not 
have been able to carry on. His mother was also there 
"rooting me on" along with his father. 
Amato does not know of any hunter, or any client of 
00:29:37 
his, who hunts deer "to get the rack, and just cut the 
horns off and leave the meat stay." Hunters who don't 
like deer meat donate it to charity. " It's a 
good thing." 
Marked increase in number of women clients over 
time. Amato shares story of a 
hunter, who on the sly, 
banded a 
duck his girlfriend had just shot. The band 
00:30:07 
read, "Jessica, will you marry me?" He then presented 
the duck to her, with the remark, "Jessica, this ones got 
a 
band on it." When she read it, she fell down on her 
knees and started crying. After she recovered her 
composure, she said "yes!" 
4 
00:32:57 
Women like to hunt, now, as well as the children. 
Amato has mounted deer trophies for kids as young as 
seven. Women are using bows now, including cross 
bows. Amato laughs, "When they harvest one (a 
deer) 
bigger than their husband, oh boy, it's on then." 
00:34:52 
Amato explains use of the term " harvest" instead of 
"kill." 
00:35:28 
Every customer that comes into his shop, Amato 
figures he will spend an average of 45 minutes to an 
hour talking to them. It is part of his success. Some 
clients he has served for so long, he ends up going to 
their funeral. "Oh, Sonny, thank you for coming. My 
dad really liked your work." (Amato starts to tear up.) 
00;38:00 
He shares story of mounting a 
pet that the owner had 
mistakenly run over. Amato insisted on mounting the 
dog with the eyes closed. "No way I 
can capture that 
look." He vows never do another one. The owner 
dropped to her knees and started crying when she saw 
the finished product. 
00:41:59 
Amato monitors the internet to keep up with the latest. 
He also goes to competitions to observe the elite work. 
Amato likes to talk to other taxidermists. There were 
"maybe" three other taxidermists in Baton Rouge when 
Amato started. All were very protective of their 
work.They would not share anything for fear of losing 
business. Today it is completely different. Amato feels 
the many how-to videos on the market that reveal 
various techniques "actually broke taxidermy through." 
Introduction of Breakthrough Magazine also helped, 
the taxidermy trade journal. " Everybody offers their 
knowledge now," Amato remarked. 
00:46:23 
Amato's approach to dealing with clients who are very 
particular: " Bring me a 
picture of how you want it." 
00:48:09 
Amato deals with many customers from across the 
U.S.. Most have hunted locally in Louisiana and now 
want their trophy either mounted in Louisiana or 
prepared for shipment to their taxidermist back home. 
5 
00:50:15 
Amato maintains a 
Facebook page. The name of the 
page is `Taxidermists Helping Taxidermists." Over 1000 
taxidermists throughout the U.S. are his "friends" on 
Facebook. The page is meant to serve as a 
forum for 
open dialogue. "We talk about other people's work." It 
was Amato's idea to start the page. He often calls 
other taxidermists in the area within a 
radius of 100 
miles just to maintain communications. " I 
just like being 
friends with other taxidermists." 
00:52:26 
Amato figures 30 to 40 of his "Friends" on Facebook 
are female taxidermists. "Some of them at a 
young age 
are doing work every bit as good as my work or better. 
Nothing is done the same way it used to be," Amato 
remarks. 
00:53:30 
The pleasure Amato receives in the work is every bit or 
more than as it was when he first started "because I 
can see my advancement." 
00:54:32 
Amato's passion and love for taxidermy hasn't 
changed. "That's one reason why I'm doing this 
interview with you. When I'm gone people will know 
about me, and maybe this will give them the urge to 
want to maybe follow in my footsteps." 
00:55:23 
"I've got something here that very few people have. It's 
a 
hobby, a 
business, and a 
passion all in one. And 1 
love going to work everyday. How many people have 
that?" Amato makes plans in advance for what he's 
going to do the day. "I 
can't wait to get into it." 
00:56:51 
Pricing his work over time "all comes into being friends 
with somebody." Clients know Amato's work, the 
quality of his work, and his price. And they understand 
the time he takes with each piece. Amato's clients are 
not into cheap, they are into quality. Clients who have 
bagged a 
trophy they have been looking for all their life 
want it mounted right. Amato comments that his prices 
are probably the most expensive within 300-400 miles 
around. His clients can afford his prices. Some clients 
don't even ask the price. " Everybody gets the same 
treatment; and everybody that I 
do work for, I 
do it like 
I'd do it for myself." 
6 
01:00:02 
Amato states the importance of praising your 
taxidermist for what they have done for you. "[The 
work] is part of them." The pay-off, in his view, is not 
money, but praise from the client for a 
job well done. 
"You can't go to the store and buy a 
steak with 
that...that's something that goes to your heart...it 
makes you feel good ... that all that work you've done, 
and everything that's involved in that particular piece, 
is well appreciated." 
01:01:39 
Amato shares all his knowledge with his two helpers. 
With no son, Amato is hopeful that another taxidermist 
will carry on the business. 
01:03:02 
Amato references some of the stories done on him in 
the media; and the seminars he has presented at the 
library, for the Boy Scouts, among others. Amato is 
earnest about spreading the knowledge. He makes 
added comments on how important it is for someone to 
be able to preserve a 
memory. "The bitterness of poor 
taxidermy remains long after the sweetness of a 
cheap 
price." 
01:04:23 
Is there a 
stigma against taxidermy? Amato puts great 
emphasis on keeping his shop organized, clean, and 
fresh smelling with ample lighting. "When you walk in 
you will never see blood nowhere." Many times one 
can judge people's work by their surroundings. Amato's 
sense of organization extends to his website, as well. 
01:07:42 
Amato speaks about the tools of the trade. A 
good 
sharp knife, a 
reference, plus a 
few basic tools. The 
work doesn't require many tools. 
01:08:51 
Amato considers the eyes to be the most critical part of 
any mount. (The interviewer was referring to how 
critical the eye of the taxidermist is, but Amato mistook 
the question to mean the eye of the mount.) 
01:09:06 
He talks about the technical challenges of mounting a 
duck. Taxidermy covers many different areas including 
painting and sculpturing. Amato still learns everyday, 
often through experimentation. 
. 
7 
01:11:06 
Amato's trophy mounts will not degrade over time. He 
explains why this is so. " It depends on how good they 
are prepared." If the client doesn't tamper with it, "your 
great grandson can view this item." 
01:12:55 
Amato does not take on museum installations nor does 
he compete in competitions. Competitions breed 
disappointment in his view, "and then you're going to 
turn that disappointment onto somebody else. It's not 
fair." 
01:16:19 
When asked about the spiritual nature of the work, 
Amato replied, " I'm a 
Christian, and I 
believe in the 
Lord, and the Lord has given me this gift to do this, and 
I 
try to please him ... and myself, also ... that's why I 
use 
reference to put it back ... back to the way he created it."
