WHAT MIT MAKES ME FAT P 
Composed and sung by FATTis STEWART. 
The question is often put to me; 
Both time and time again, 
Not only by the youngsters, 
But ladies and gentlemen. 
No matter whether in the house, 
Or, whether I 
walk out, 
Some one will cry, as I 
pass by, 
What is it makes you stout ? 
CHORUS. 
Now, though I 
am so very fat, 
I 
once was thin and lean, 
'Whether in the shade, or in the sun, 
My shadow is seldom seen. 
Some doctors say to go to bed 
Arid drink porter, beer, and ale; 
But notwithstan jog all they said, 
I 
still grew thin and pale. 
Others said, take some good oil cake, 
And hot baths to the chin, 
I 
was roasted and baked, and—mercy sake, 
And yet I 
still got thin. 
Now, though I 
am so very fat, ttc. 
Doctor Taylor's Olive branch Bitters, 
At last they gave to me, 
And so to speak within a 
week, 
A 
great hange I 
could see. 
When I 
got up and tried to -walk, 
I 
had no cause to squall, 
For after taking just three bottles, 
My clothes they were too small. 
Now, though I 
am- so very fat, dm 
So I 
continued day by day, 
To grow as fat as Mars, 
And double; fair I 
,have to pay, 
For riding in the ears. 
And as I 
pass along the street, 
Methinks I 
hear folk's titters, 
And as they gaze on me from head to feet,. 
I 
thank good Taylor's bitters. 
Now, though I 
am so very fat, Ete.

THE BIG IICTUN. 
Composed and sung by Ferris STEWART. 
I 
am the big Chief of the Chippewa Tribe 
From Utah Territory just arrived, 
Where Brigham Young makes all the laws, 
And I, like him, have a 
half a 
hundred squaws. 
So you see, I've no cause to fret— 
I 
drink all the whiskey I 
can get— 
I 
never work, for it don't suit me— 
I'm a 
Jolly big Injun out upon a 
spree. 
Hi yah, hi yah, ace. 
I'm not the kind of Injun 'steals everything they see, 
I 
steal nothing I 
can't carry, if it can't carry me— 
Everybody has his failing, but this is mine, I 
think, 
When I 
get among the whiskey barrels I 
don't know how to 
drink. 
My name is George Washington, Andrew Jackson, Napoleon 
Bonaparte, Sinclair, Ben Butler Brown, 
I 
am the biggest Injun for many miles around, 
I 
care for nobody, nobody cares for me, 
I'm a 
Jolly big Injun out upon a 
spree. 
Fri yah, hi yah, tite. 
PAT MURPHY. 
By FATT1E STEWART. 
AIR—" 
Jenny Jones." 
My name is Pat Murphy, I 
come from Killarney, 
The sweetest of spots on the gem of the sea, 
Where the boys they are famous for tipping the blarney, 
But faith they're as brave as the bravest can be; 
On the fifth of December they had a 
great meeting; 
In Dublin's big city, but sure I'll not brag— 
,. 
Across the wide water tl ey send us this greeting. 
Old Ireland is true to the American Flag. 
; 
At that meeting the Chairman passed these resolutions: 
Resolved, when our people were forced to roam, 
On American soil 'neath the free Institutions, 
With the right hand of friendship they there found a 
home. 
A home with the rights of a 
citizen gifted— 
Where free from all tyrants they ever might be; 
And the hand of old Ireland shall never be lifted 
To strike a 
foul blow 'gainst the Flag of the Free. 
When the death hand of famine was laid on our Island, 
And those who should help us, quick turn their back— 
When thousands were dying in valley and highland, 
Who was it that sent us relief in a 
crack / 
'Twas Americans—truly old Ireland's defenders— 
An Irishman all in her troubles should share, 
And now on the field they march forth to defend her, 
In an Irish Brigade led by brave Gen]. Meagher. 
Then here's to the fair land of Freedom, God bless her 1 
And here's to the might of the arm that delves; - 
Too long we have fought to uphold the oppressors; 
The time is now come to fight for ourselves. 
Then off with the chains which the Tyrant bath wreathed, 
And Liberty ever our watchword shall be— 
And ne'er shall our swords in the scabbards be sheathed 
Until Ireland beconies like America Free.

CORPORAL Vir.ECI.c.b. 
Composed and sung by FATTIE STEWART. 
Am—" Captain Jinks." 
l'm Corporal White, of the Black Brigade, 
I'm always ready for dress parade, 
The boys of me are getting afraid, 
Since I've been in the army. 
I 
teach the wenches how to sing, 
And some to dance the Highland Fling— 
I 
often cut the pigeon wing, 
For I 
am the pet of the army. 
Spoken—Yes, you ought to see me every Sunday afternoon 
when I 
get my new uniform on; then I 
hear the colored ladies 
say: " who is dat gentleman ?" some one will answer, that's 
Corporal White of the Black Brigade, 
Always ready for dress parade, 
The boys of me are getting afraid, 
Since I've been in the army. 
I 
left the old massa in '61, 
And joined the soldier-4 
at Bull Run, 
And then skedaddled to Washington, 
Along with the rest of the army. 
When I 
left home my mammy did cry, 
But then I 
think it was for joy, 
The old man said I 
was a 
bad boy, 
For joining the Yankee Army. 
Spoken—And when the fighting commenced, I 
was the first 
one to go to the front, and after the first rally I 
was the first 
one to go to Washington, yes, sir. 
There was some running 
done dar, and f 
did some mighty tall walking; but just as I 
was 
crossing the Georgetown Bridge, some boys hollered out, there 
goes 
Corpo al White, dm 
There is a 
gal on Thompson Street, 
Who every afternoon 1 
meet, 
She always looks at m • so sweet, 
I 
think she trying to charm me. 
I'm vino- to see her again to-night, 
And ask her to be Mrs. White, 
If Uncle Sam should get in a 
fight,, 
Well both go join the army. 
I'm Corporal White. & c.

FORTY YEAR.S 
-AGO. 
Composed and sung by Earrin STEWART. 
Am—" The Admiral." 
I 
hope you w:11 not think me bold, 
Or, say I 
make too free, 
The young folks say I'm growing old, 
Though I'm only sixty-three. 
It seems to me but yesterday, 
My good old wife and I 
Stood hand in hand in the village church, 
Our hearth both filled with joy. 
And then at night, oh, what delight, 
Such joys were seldom seen, 
'As each young fellow took his lass, 
And tr pped it on the green. 
In that gay throng there was not one 
At wrestling could me throw; 
But I'm not as young as I 
used to be, 
Some Forty Years Ago. 
CHORUS. 
No, rm not as young as I'd used to be, 
Some Forty Years Ago. 
When I 
have done my daily toils, 
My wife stands at the gate, 
She asks, her face bedeeked with smiles, 
What kept you out so late ? 
She'll lake my arm and lead me to 
The arm-chair by the fire, 
And if I 
feel a 
littletross., 
Her patience never tire. 
My grand children they gather itund, 
And on my knees will creep, 
I 
sing, and te 1 
them stories 
'Till they all drop elf to sleep. 
'Tis then we talk of the good old times, 
When first I 
was her hum, 
And I 
feel as young as I 
used to feel, • 
Some Forty Years Ago. 
Yes, I 
feel as young as I 
used to feel, 
Some Forty Ye.ars Ago.

THE PARIS EX POSITION. 
Composect and sung by PATTIE STENYAET. 
Aut--" A 
Wet Sheet and a 
Flowing Sea-" 
From the Paris Exposition I 
lately have arrived, 
Full of information from there I 
have derived, 
There was wonderful curiosities wherever you chanced to glance, 
To see, I 
was bent, what America sent, to the Exposition in 
France. 
Spoken—Yes, as soon as I 
entsred the exposition, the first 
thing that struck my observation was a 
large sign with these 
curiosities from the United States. 
Over a 
small door was in-
scribed—Furniture. 
I 
went in, and there I 
saw the stool of re-
pentance, manufactured by the United States for the English 
Market; then there was the Freedman's Bureau, another large 
piece of furniture; a 
Presidential chair with an uneasy seat; 
Multiplication Table, used for spreading out the National Debt, 
and leaves enough to hold it all; and a 
Naval Secretary, one 
sent abroad to be returned with foreign polish. 
We then vis-
ited the wearing apparel department, there I 
saw an English 
cloak of Neutrality worn quite threadbare and very transparent; 
then there were a 
lot of waste coats, from Washington D. C. ; a 
lot of suspenders from Wall street, N. Y. City; ten per cent. 
and a 
lot of check drawers for Bank Tellers, 
And as I 
roamed from room to room, . 
Strange objects met my glance, 
To see, I 
was bent, what America sent. 
To the Exposition in France. 
An introduction I 
received to Louis Napoleon, the third, 
Who warmly took me, and said of me he'd heard: 
Says he, you're welcome to our land as long as you pay your 
bill. 
I 
smiled, of course, and, said, old Horse, you bet you're life I 
will. 
[11 
THE PARIS EXPOSITION [CONCLUDED.] 
Spoken—lie then asked me to visit the Organ Department, 
there I 
saw the Great New York Organ running entirely by gas 
manufactured by the inventor, and presented by its owner, 
James Gordon Bennett; then there was an organ manufactured 
of black Ebony and white Oak, exhibited by Horace Greely ; 
then there was an organ made of Black Walnut and Palmetto, 
playing southern airs principally, and exhibited by the proprie-
tors of the New York World; then there was " organic remains" 
by Forney of Philadelphia, and a 
model of the Great Organ in 
Boston; from there we went into the Musical Department, ale 
first musical instrument that struck my observation was an old 
'English Lyre, with the inscription on it " London Times ;" there 
was the Horn of Plenty ; a 
Viol of wrath; a 
Drum of Figs; a 
Conundrum ; a 
Harp from the celebrated flails of Mr. Tara; 
Harper's for September, from the United States; a 
stove-pipe 
and an American Drum that can't be beat. , 
As I 
roamed, (tc. 
Napoleon asked me what I 
thought of all the sights I'd seen, 
I 
told I 
would be much pleased if he'd show me the great 
Eugene, 
;Ile knit his brow, curled his moustache, and in a 
rage did fly, 
While I 
cooly struck his att.tude and said, how is this for high ? 
Spoken—Yes, the Emperor after that gave me the cold shoul-
der, and I 
was forced to proceed with my investigations without 
the assistance of his Imperial highness; but I 
didn't forget to 
tell we had just as good old women in our country as he dare be,so 
I 
strolled in o 
the Water Department, there I 
saw a 
cataract pre-
sented by a 
gent eman who had one in his eye; a 
Waterfall pre-
-,wnted by an American lady who wore one on her head; a 
Sea 
of Trouble presented by the United States with a•fence around it 
td.keep foreign powers from falling in; a 
lot of Kings and Queens 
who had ceased to reign; a 
Torrent of words from a 
New York 
Politician, and some waves from the American Flag. 
I 
next via-
iteci the Line Department; and saw the Line of Battle of the late 
Civil War -in America, exceeding in length anything ever known 
in Europe; there was the line of duty, generally imperceptible 
to those of long standing in the Political world; then there was 
the line on which General Grant finished the late Rebellion; 
free labor manu'acture, very strong ; then there was curiosities 
from American cities; virtue from Chicago; cleanliness from 
Cairo; loyalty from New Orleans, and honesty from the City of 
New-York.

NEW BY-WORDS. 
Composed by FATTIE STEWART. 
I 
brought my old Cremona,, 
To sing and p 
ay for you, 
I've been down among the mokes, 
In search of something new. 
Strange by- words are all the rage, 
Now white folks if you wi h, 
The sayings of this enlghtened age, 
I'll hoop you up. a 
dish. 
Csouns.—Rich and poor, white and black, 
Old folks and children playing. 
No matter who you chance to meet, 
They're sure to have some saying.. 
You bet your bottom dollar. 
With a 
friend I 
went to Central Park, 
I 
really can't tell why, 
In trying to skate I 
broke my pate, 
They hollered, " how is this for high r 
My friend said, skating was red hot, 
While I 
stood like a 
fool, 
Because I 
could not skate myself, 
I 
had to take it cool. 
Rich and poor, &c. 
To-day, while walking down the street, 
Enjoying my Havana, 
Some person hit me on the back, 
Saying. that's what's the matter with Bannah. 
I 
turned and saw my sweetheart smile, 
With her face behind her muff, 
Says I, my daddy has struck ile, 
She answered " good enough." 
Rich and poor, & c. 
Next morning to her house I 
went, 
For love was. in my breast, 
Says„I, my dear, will you be mine ? 
She said; Oh, give us a 
rest. 
Then down upon my knees I 
fell, 
And tender lines did spout, 
And her baby brother hollered out, 
" 
Does your mother know you're out ?" 
Ri-h and poor, &c. 
She says, you go and ask my Pa, 
And as we sat a 
talking, 
The old man he came in saying, 
How is the old thing working, 
Says .1, I 
love.your daughter, 
He re died, you silly elf, 
If she can make.you happy, take her, 
You know how it is yourself.

To sing and dance, or drink good punch,

And if any dare insult me, I'm the divirs boy for fighting.

Then hurrah for Paddy's land,

When I

'Of course, qv purse was rather scant, but my heart was light 
and easy, 
'11111I met Miss Judy at a

She stole my heart, 'tis all her own, but sure I'm almost crazy. 
To get back to Paddy's land, 
For .4

I

And 'my name is Pat McCann. 
Since Fve been here I

But here my little ditty ends, for the ship is nearly S'tartin. 
That - takes Me back to Judy dear, and then we'll suYely matrien

And when the wedding does come off, there'll be an hit& Ju-

Good friends, you see I'm one French gentleman,

And I've met with an English lady, 
Who says she'll teach me an English dance.

And to call on her at the very first chance, 
Next (lay, I 
went to see the lady, 
And received the first lesson in English dance. 
Sillily Shillong., &c. 
She said she would teach me the English language, 
For just two hundred dollars in advance, 
I 
paid her the cash, when a 
great big bully 
Rushed into the room and stopped the dance. 
Shiny Shillong, &c. 
Re says: that is my wife, what are you doing here ? 
The lady she stood like one in a

THE LITTLE CHURCH AROUN D THE CORNER. 
Composed by FATTIE STEWART. Music by GEORGE H. COES. 
[M R. JOSEPH JEFFERSON made an application to officiate at the 
funeral of Mr. Holland. 
It appears that the clergyman first consent-
ed to allow the funeral to take place from his church, but when he 
learned that Mr. Holland had been an Actor, he withdrew his consent. 
He added, that there was a 
little church around the corner from his, 
where funerals of actors had taken place, and where he advised Mr. 
Jefferson to make application. 
Mr. Jefferson left with the character-
istic remark; " All honor to the little church around the corner."j • 
'Twas in a 
Christitn land 
A Veteran Actor lay; 
Whose sands of life had near run out, 
And soon must pass away. 
" 
I 
fear not death," quoth he, 
" 
My life has been upright," 
A. heavenly smile passed o'er his face, 
A soul had taken flight. 
But alas! he was an actor, (to. 
His friends had gathered 'round, 
Their last respects to pay, 
And one who knew his Christian heart, 
Now sadly wound his way 
To a 
minister, and begged 
That he'd read a 
funeral prayer; 
We never pray for Actors, no, 
But, I'll tell you where 
There's a 
little churn around the corner. 
In vain his friends did plead, 
But Sabine would not budge; 
Instead of trying to redeem, 
He fain would be the judge. 
The felon in his cell, 
Or murderer doomed to die, 
Can have a 
sermon read for them, 
But not our friend, and why. 
Alas! he was an Actor, &o. 
With pity and disgust, 
The friends now turned toward 
A sit pherd, who protects his flock, 
And lives to serve the Lord. 
The service I 
e 
performed, 
And prayed for that poor soul, 
The friends discovered they had found, 
A Christian no: a 
fool. 
Alas! he was an Actor, &c.

Composed and sung by PATTIE SravrAar. 
I've just arrived from Manayunk, 
To see what can be seen, 
The folks all call me crazy Sal, 
My name is Sarah Green. 
The reason why I 
left my home, 
And come down to the city, 
The boys they all run after me 
Because I 
was so pretty. 
CHORUS. 
I 
never had a 
father, I 
never had a 
mother, 
I'm crazy Sal, Saucy Sal, 
I 
never had a 
sister. I 
never had a 
brother, 
But I'm somebody's gal. 
I 
wish I 
was somebody's wife, 
And if any here there be, 
That wants to settle down for life, 
Just only look at me. 
I 
can cook your clothes and mend your gruel 
But if you should get drunk, 
I'll make you wish you'd never seen 
Fat Sal from Manayunk.

Composed and sung by FAME STEWART 
Ata—" Rock-a-bye Baby." 
I've just arrived from Tennesee, 
The place where I 
was born, 
I 
used to work for i‘lassa Lee, 
Among the fields of corn. 
The soldiers come along one day, 
And said that I 
was free, 
I 
dropped my hoe, and said good-by 
To good old Tennesee. 
CHORUS. 
For 'twas dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, 
All the live long day, 
The worst of the trouble, the darkies have to dig 
Though we'd not much trouble with the pay. 
Since I've been up here in the north, 
I've saved up lots of cash, 
I 
never keep low company, 
Nor mix with common trash. 
I 
expect I 
will get married soon, 
There's a 
gentleman axed my hand 
His name is Sam from Alabam, 
Like me a 
contraband. 
And now kind friends, good-evening, 
For here my song must end, 
I 
hope I've not offended, 
For I 
did not intend. 
But if I 
have amused you, 
Be generous in my cause, 
And show your appreciation, 
By giving your applause.

Composed by FATTIE STEWART. 
Here we are as you can see, 
Two wandering contrabands, 
We just arrived from Tennessee, 
Ou • names is Jake and Sam. 
We usad to work for Dr. White, 
Among the hemp and corn, 
We used to have our fun at night 
And go to work at dawn. 
CHORUS. 
White folks, just look at us, 
Our names is Jake and Sam, 
We're all the way from Tennessee, 
Two wandering contrabands. 
When we worked for Dr. White, 
We got enough to eat, 
Plenty clothes upon our back, 
And shoos upon our feet. 
But, oh I 
the things are different now, 
Since us poor darks are free, 
And don't we wish that we were back, 
In good old Tennessee. 
Then give us back our Sugar Cane, 
Cotton and the corn, 
And give us back the spot we love, 
The cot where we were born. 
We've looked for work all over town, 
Stopped every one we meet, 
And now we're forced to sing and dance, 
To get something to eat. 
So, kind folks, all take pity, pray, 
Extend the helping hand, 
And give a 
stake, to me and Jake, 
Two wandering contrabands.

Just hand to Sam and me,

Composed and sung by FAIT= STEWART. 
Am—" Trinity Chimes." 
Good-evening, kind friends, 'here I 
be, 
I 
thought I'd just drop in to see, 
If there are any here like me, 
Who acts upon the stage. 
The people call me Jack of Hearts, 
Because I 
play auch funny parts, 
I 
laugh and cry, by fits and starts, 
Then fly into a 
rage. 
(Imitations.) 
CHORUS. 
I'm very fnnny, some folks say, 
To see me sad, makes you feel gay, 
What I 
call work, you call play, 
Oh I 
I 
wish it was salary day. 
The funniest thing I've got to tell, 
Is about a 
girl named Isabel, 
With her over ears in love I 
fell, 
While acting on the stage. 
To-day, she did my heart delight, 
By saying, that on next Sunday night, 
She'd be my wife, all right and tight, 
I 
laughed, you may engage. 
(Business of laughing, 
l'm very funny, & c. 
'They say, that true love never runs smooth 
And here's a 
letter which goes to prove 
What a 
fool I 
was to fall in love, 
While acting on the stage. 
To-day she went for water, to the well, 
She leaned too far, and in she fell. 
And down to the bottom went Isabel, 
So now I'll leave the stage. 
(Business of crytng.) 
I'm very funny, & c.

Rind friends, my name it is John Schmidt, 
No matter where I 
travel, 
And just because my name is Schmidt, 
I'm always in great trouble. 
No matter sleeping or awake, 
f 
I 
walk, or stand, or sit, 
I'm sure to hear some loafer cry out, 
How you was John Schmidt ? 
CHORUS. 
What a 
country, what a 
peoples, 
Nobody ever did see, 
I 
wish I 
Was back home again, 
In good old Germany. 
Whenever I 
walk in the street, 
The boys all at me shout, 
Some they call me lager beer, 
Others, sour krout. 
To-day, two ladies passed me by, - 
The old one give a 
grunt 
And said: Mary Ann, just look at dat man 
With a 
grecian bend in front. 
What a 
country, &c. 
The other day to take the air, 
I 
walked down on Grand street, 
And just in front of ,a 
dry goods store, 
Some lady friends did meet. 
And while we was talking about dem fellows 
That's fighting in Havana,. 
Some loafer, I 
don't know, come and hit me just so, 
Awl says, dat's what's the matter wid Hannah. 
What a

Don't talk to me of sparkling wines, 
Madeira or Champagne, 
If you freely use the beverage, 
'Tis sure to turn the brain. 
It may be good breeding a 
glass to extend, 
But it suits me much better by far, 
To sit by the fire and chat with a 
friend, 
As I 
smoke my Havana Cigar. 
CHORUS. 
My brain is clear, I've nothing to fear, 
And nought my pleasures can mar, 
So a 
fig for Brandy, Wine, or Beer, 
•I prefer my Havana Cigar. 
Let poets sing of the. flowing bowls, 
For me it has no charms, 
'Tis sure to rob you of friends and home, 
And perhaps to seek after alms. 
On the stage of ife there is many a 
man, 
Who might be a 
brilliant star 
If he'd give up strong drink, and follow my plan 
Of smoking a 
quiet cigar. 
Then remember the adage, it's never too late, 
'So throw the wine cup afar, 
And think of the drunkard, and what. is'his fate, 
As you smoke your Havana Cigar. 
THE ACTOR. 
Composed and sung by PATTIE STEWAUT. 
Am—" Sam Brown the Raftsman." 
My cognomen is Peter Brown, 
And Shakespeare's be n 
my aim, 
I've studied hard for twenty years, 
To ascend the ladder of fame. 
But hard luck seems to fo low me 
Wherever I 
have been, 
The folks call me a 
spouter 
Instead of a 
Tragedian. 
Spoken—Yes, I 
always felt as though I 
was born for the stage, 
for I 
never feel as happy as when playing the part of Othello, 
especially where he sa,s : Blood! blood I I 
ago, blood! 1 
moues. 
For I'm the chap you've heard about, 
Peter Brown's my name, 
I 
kill some fellow every night, 
And do it all for fame. 
There was Richard the 3d, OM England's King, 
The wickedest man in town, 
He murdered friends and kindred, 
In order to reach the crown. 
And when he tried to sleep at night, 
Their Ghosts all would appear, 
With hideous yells and dying groans, 
Making him wake with fear. 
Spoken—Bind up my wounds, and give me another horse. 
A 
horse! a 
horse ! ! 
My Kingdom for a 
horse! 
For I 
am the chap, dm. 
Macbeth comes next upon the list, 
A verse on him I'll sing, 
He murdered Duncan and his friends, 
And then they made him King. 
And when he gave a 
grand banquet, 
Wi ere sparkling wines did flow, 
The Ghost of Banquo did appear, 
And made him tremble so. 
Spoken—A 
vaunt, and quit me sight! let the earth hide I 
thy 
bones are marrowless I 
thy blood is cold ! thou hast no specula, 
tion in those eyes which thou dost glare with! 
For I 
am the chap, &c. 
THE RAGMAN. 
Composed and sung by F.A.Trn: STEWART. 
Now kind folks, all just gather round, 
And list to my sad tale, 
'Tis of a 
family in town, 
It makes my heart bewail. 
They used to Lye in Kensington, • 
As you shall quickly hear, 
They kept a 
little Grocery Shop, 
And sold good Lager Beer. 
Now Mr. Hans, the Landlord, 
Was a 
man of great renown, 
He was known in every beer saloon, 
For twenty squares around. 
He used to drink and sleep all day, 
'Till the sun sank in the west, 
And then with other Germans, 
He drove the night express. 
Mr. Hans a 
daughter had, 
A pretty little dear, 
Who 'tended to the Grocery Store, 
And drawed the lager beer. 
She fell in love with a 
rag-picker, 
Who was often heard to vow, 
That he would go and kill himself, 
If she wouldn't be his frow. 
Now, when her father heard of this, 
It made him stamp and swear, 
He said he'd kill the ragman, 
If ever he caught him there. 
THE RAGMAN—[CoNcLunzto.] 
This caused his daughter to shed tears, 
To hear him talk so savage, 
So she went up stairs and stabbed herself, 
With a 
big Bologna Sausage. 
As soon as the ragman heard of this, 
It almost broke his heart, 
He swore that he would be revenged, 
And for the Beer Saloon did start. 
And such a 
scene was witnessed there, 
Would cause your blood to freeze, 
For he cut his throat from ear to ear, 
With a 
piece of limberger cheese. 
When her father saw what he had done, 
It made him feel right sorry, 
Says he, 1 
was one grand Jackass, 
Why didn't I 
let 'em marry. 
And now, says he, I've bothered for pelf, 
I'm bound to see it out. 
So he went and smothered himself 
in a 
dish of Sour Krout. 
The man that wrote this, he soon died, 
It made him feel so queer, 
He went and committed suicide, 
Which makes me shed this tear. 
To the Sehulkyll he did bound, 
And then prepared to jump, 
Looked in, turned round, walked away, 
And soon was found deal drunk.

POOR OLD JOB.' t 
Gone are the days when my heart was young and gay, 
Gone are my friends from the cotton fields away; 
Gone from the earth to a 
better land I 
know— 
I 
hear their gentle voices calling Poor Old Joe! 
CHORUS. 
I'm coming, I'm coming, my head is bending low, 
I 
hear their gentle voices calling Poor Old Joe. 
Why do I 
weep, when my heart should feel no pain ? 
Why do I 
sigh, that my friends come not again ? 
Grieving for forms now departed long ago— 
I 
hear their gentle voices calling Poor Old Joe. 
I'm coming, I'm coining, my head is bending low 
I 
hear their gentle voices calling Poor Old Joe. 
Where are the hearts, once so happy and so free 
The children so dear that I 
held upon my knee ? 
Gone to the shore where my soul has longed to go— 
I 
hear their gentle voices calling Poor Old Joe! 
I'm coming. I'm coming, my head is bending low, 
I 
hear their gentle voices calling Poor Old Joe. 
WRY 
-DIDN'T YOU SAY SO BEFORE. 
New by-words you know now-a-days, are the rage, 
You'll bear them from every tongue; 
Wherever you go you'll find that it's so, 
The little, the big, old and young; 
Even the ladies are fond of the slang, 
While the boys in the street loudly roar, 
Oh, how they do shout, the latest one out, 
Why didn't you say so before 
One day driven mad with a 
toothache so bad, 
I 
rushed to the first doctor's shop, 
When the grinder he eyed and the tongs he applied, 
And lie pulled me six times round the shop; 
Said 1, when he'd done, you've pulled out the wrong one, 
While with agony loud f 
did roar; 
Now it's done, sir, says he, the fault don't lay with me; 
Why didn't you say so before! 
I 
once asked a 
friend me ten dollars to lend, 
And said : I'd return it next day. 
When he did begin at once to rub his chin, 
And these words, unto me he did say; 
Old boy, it's too bad, I 
should have been glad, 
In fact, I'd have let you have more 
Had you called yesterday,—now, it's all paid away, 
-, Why didn't you say so before! 
My wife yesterday sat-crying away, 
Because our first-born was a 
boy; 
All day she would sigh and keep rubbing her eye, 
Instead of being happy with joy; 
Says she to me, Joe, I 
hate boys, you know,

THE HUNGRY MAN. 
I've been famishing hungry e'er since l've been born, 
I'm eating, and drinking, noon, midLight and morn, 
When a 
babe ray great appetite shewed itself soon, 
For I 
once tried to swallow a 
basin and spoon, 
They tell me that each day I 
grew worse, 
They'd to watch me for fear I 
should swallow the nurse, 
I've tried almost everything, all kinds of stuff, 
But somehow I 
never can get half enough. 
I'm eating and drinking from morning till night, 
Still I'm hungry, still I'm hungry—it's serious quite, 
I'm getting so thin, I'll soon be out of sight, 
And the more I 
have, why the more I 
want thro' my graet 
appetite. 
I 
have been invited to sup or to dine, 
But I 
played such a 
havoc with joint and with wine, 
.That they stared with alarm, and aslied me no more, 
Now no one's at home when I 
knock at their door; 
No cook stays a 
month with me, as l'm alive, 
They say one's no use that I 
ought to keep five. 
Friends give me COLD SHOULDER whenever we meet (meat) 
And groan if I 
happen to mention the heat. (eat) 
I'm eating, dm, 
First thing in the morning, I've ham, eggs, and toast, 
Then for breakfast, a 
couple of fowls boiled or roast, 
After that slight repast clean away I 
can pack, 
A 
small leg of mutton by way of " a 
snack." 
I've managed from then until dinner came round, 
Then I'd soups, fish and joints, about five or six pounds, 
Then I've " Iong'd" for my tea, served with chops, steak or ham 
And for supper made shift with a 
quarter of lamb. 
l'm eating, &c. 
My Doctors suggested a 
curt-ious diet, 
To CURE me of hunger and daily I 
try it, 
Such as cow-heel, and cucumber fried up in lard, 
Tripe, treacle and turpentine, boiled till it's hard; 
Sheep's-head and artichokes, herrings and lamb, 
Grilled well anti served up with mussels and jam, 
Pickles and pigeon's milk, stewed glycerine, 
Salt fish and friccaseed sewing machine. 
I'm eating, &c. 
I've tried German sausage and sprats boiled in ale, 
Linseed meal poultice, and puppy dog's tail 
Stew'd gutta percha, ( which pain'd my old throttle,) 
Sourkrout, osokerit, and soap brown and mottle; 
Even Australian beef, had it cut off the prime, 
After that I 
went in for some chloride of lime, 
Beeswax and brimstone, glue, penny ro3 al, 
And velocipede frizzled in cod liver oil. 
Still I'm eating, dre.

MY PRETTY LITTLE BUCKINGHAMSHIRE 
GIRL. 
Written and sung by J. TROWBRIDGE. 
Your glasses fill I 
pray, and drink to Milly gray, 
A charmer who can be surpassed by none; 
Tho' simply a 
country girl, she really is a 
pearl, 
And dearly loved bp almost every one. 
I 
never can forget the day that I 
first met 
This charming girl, her face with smiles beaming, 
Down by my uncle's farm, with a 
basket on her arm, 
Taking breakfast to some peasants that were gleaning. 
CHORUS. 
Then Cupid's little dart, I 
feel has pierced my heart, 
With joy and pride my heart feels in a 
whirl ; 
I'm sure there's not a 
lass, in London can surpass, 
My pretty little Buckinghamshire girl. 
Now as she tripp'd along, warbling some pretty song, 
I 
stood and listened, just as if spell-bound ; 
For not thinking I 
was near, she sang with voice so clear, 
That seemed to float on the air for miles around. 
84 
PRETTY BUCKINGHAMSHIRE GIRL. 
[CONCLUDED 
She paused on seeing me, and I 
thought that she must be 
A 
fairy, or 'twas fancy's daring flight, 
Until to me she spoke, then the spell upon me bloke, 
Thus I 
fell in love with Milly at first sight. 
Then Cupid's little dart, &c. 
To you I 
will describe, my darling " Mill" with pride, 
She's as fair as :lily girl that could be seen, 
Blue eyes, with teeth like pearls, and golden hair in curls, 
Of pretty girls she really is the queen, 
Her age is twenty-one, she's always full of fun, 
Tier heart is kind and true to the core ; 
For many miles around, she has alway been renowned, 
For her charity and kindness to the poor. 
Then Cupid's little dart, &c. 
My love for Milly Gray increases every day, 
And in return she dearly loves me too ; 
Rich rivals I 
have got, but I 
don't care a 
jot, 
Fin sure she will never prove untrue; 
She is my joy and pride, and when by her side, 
I 
feel as proud as any Lord, or Earl, 
She is soon to be my wife, then I'll love her all my life 
My pretty little Buckinghamshire girl.

tell  you some strange sights I've seen,Whilst rambling thro' the town. 
I 
saw two drunken fellows, 
Who were fighting in the street, 
A 
policeman on the other side 
Look'd on, 'twas off his beat. 
RAMBLING TIRO' TELE TOWN.—ICoNCLuDED. 
He said, " I 
cannot interfere ;" 
He was an artful Bob, 
He was locking up some unmuzzled pup— 
A 
far more easy job. 
These men fought on, till one poor wretch, 
Half dead, at length fell down; 
I 
thought this was .a 
disgraceful sight, 
Whilst rambling through the town. 
A woman stopped me in the street, 
Though shabby, yet look'd clean; 
She begg'd, and said, " My children starve, 
We better days 'have seen. 
Jib, sir, some charitable rich 
Won't give to such-as me, 
But only where their gift's made known 
Through papers publicly." 
I 
don't possess a 
fortune, 
Still I 
spar'(l her half a 
crown, 
And turn'd from that distressing sight, 
Whilst rambling through the town. 
A sight---'twas even worse than that— 
A 
soldier next I 
saw. 
He'd but one arm and leg, 
I 
thought a 
shocking thing is war 
lie had two medals, for he'd fought 
All through that cold Crimea, 
His pension was sixpence a 
day, 
But only for one year. 
As an Englishman, I 
fairly 'blush'd, 
My head I 
hung it down, 
At that neglected hero, I 
Saw rambling through the -town. 
And then I 
saw a 
sight to see, 
Which no one would desire, 
'Twos somewhere in this neighborhood. 
A 
very large house on fire; 
A woman rush'd about the street, 
And shriek'd in accents wild, 
" 
Good heavens, is there no one here 
Will try and save my child." 
A 
fireman up a 
ladder flew, 
And brought her infant down: 
That was the noblest sight I 
saw 
Whilst rambling though the town..

CALIFORNIA'S GOLDEN SICEEL.D. 
kirt:—" Castles in the Air." 
By H UGH ROB:SON. 
I'm going to sing of warriors, and noble statesmen too— 
Of California's heroes, who were both brave and true, 
For love of land and open hearts they're noted through the 
world, 
And ever ready for the fray, when our nations flag's un-
fit ; 
Oh may our country always last, and our soldiers a,ways 
be, 
Ever ready to protect the banner of the free; 
And the noble souls that died for us, on many a 
well-fought 
field, 
Oh write their name in letters bright, on 
California's Golden 
There is a 
name that's known to all, to Californiar's most 
dear, 
It is the lamented Baker, for him we shed a 
tear, 
A statesman and a 
warrior true, one of the good old School, 
That built the nation for us, and gave us the golden rule. 
When the cry it came for volunteers, to keep our flag on 
high, 
The noble Baker rallied, but, on Ball's Bluff he did die. 
He died beneath the starry flag, on that ill-fated field. 
Oh! place his name in letters bright, on 
California's Golden Shield. 
There was the noble Broderick, too, a 
statesman very rare; 
When in the halls of Congress he made them all to stare. 
Among the men that make our laws he nobly did stand, 
And advocated all the rights of our little golden land. 
But he was taken from us, cut down while in his bloom. 
Oh! let us join together and plant laurels round his tomb, 
And may his fame be ne'er forgot for he was true as steel. 
His name will shine through endless time, on 
California's Golden Piield.

NY MOTHER, TOO, GROWS OLD. 
While sitting by my father's side, 
Whose days are almost told, 
Another aged form is there— 
My mother, too, grows old. 
She toiled with him life's sunny glades, 
Life's sultry noon away; 
She's resting now in life's cool shades, 
The shades of evening day. 
CHORUS. 
Upon Eternity's dread shore 
I 
see death's angel slay, 
And which I 
scarcely dare to think 
He first will call away. 
The warm affections of her heart, 
With time nor age grows cold; 
Her eye such love-light still imparts, 
I 
scarce can think her old. 
But when beneath her cap of snow 
Some whiten'd locks unfold, 
And as I 
watch her step, I 
know 
My mother, too grows old. 
Upon Eternity's. &C. 
Engraven on her furrowed brow, 
The peace of God I 
see; 
His peace has kept her heart till row 
From grief and sorrow free; 
They've weather'd all the storms of life, 
Together sailed life's sea, 
And calmly may their ship now sail 
To the haven where they'd be. 
Upon Eternity's, are. 
YOU NEVER MISS THE WATER TILL THE 
WELL RUNS DRY. 
When a 
child I 
lived at Flushing with my parents at the farm, 
The lessons that my mother taught to me were quite a 
charm 
She would often take me on her knee when tired of childish play, 
And as she pressed me to her breast I've heard my mother say; 
CIIORUS. 
Waste not, want not, is a 
maxim I 
would teach, 
Let your watch-word be despatch and practice what you preach, 
Do not let your chances like sunbeams pass you by, 
For you never miss the water till the well runs dry. 
As years roll'd on I 
grew to be a 
mischief-making boy, 
Destruction seemed my only sport it was my only joy, 
And well do I 
remember when °fames well chastised, 
how father sat beside me, and thus has me advised; 
Waste not, want not, tte. 
When I 
arrived at manhood I 
embarked in public life, 
And found it was a 
rugged road, bestrewn with care and strife, 
I 
speculated foolishly, my losses were Revere, 
But still a 
little voice kept whispering in my ear. 
Waste not, want not, &c. 
Then I 
studied strict economy and found to my surprise, 
My funds instead of sinking very quickly then did rise, 
grasped each chance and always struck the iron while twas hot, 
I 
seized my opportunities and never once forgot: 
Waste not, want not, &c. 
I'm m-trried now and happy, I've a 
careful little wife, 
We live in peace and harmony devoid of care and strife, 
Fortune smiles upon us, we have little children three, 
The lesson that I 
teach them, as they prattle round my knee; 
Waste not, want not, dye.

THE ACTIVE BOY. 
Good evening, folks, pray how are you, 
I've come to sing what I

But I

I'm ready now to take employ,

And I

It will charm the hearts of all the girIs 
And of course, I

For I

And now I

From a 
Boot Black to a 
Brigadier. 
When I'm required 
always here. 
But by the way I 
suppose you know, 
It's nearly time for me to go ; 
So, Ladies and Gents, to please I've tried. 
And I

But now before I 
go to-night. 
I'll try to give you a 
Clog- Hornpipe.

SWELL OF THE PERIOD 
o 
doubt I'm a 
stranger to most of you -here. 
I'm the lealer of fashion, my name's Captain Vera. 
FDA known in the West, as a 
matter of course, 
In fashionable society I 
ride the high horse. 
I 
was born, so they say, with a 
spoon iu my mouth 
Made of silver. 
Be that as it may, 
Wherever I 
go, be it East, West, or South, 
122 whispers I 
hear people say,

I'm the swell of the period, 
The Star of the West, 
The leader of fashion, 
That must be confessed. 
I 
cause great excitement 
Wherever I'm seen; 
In fashionable society, 
Why, I 
reign supreme. 
I 
rise every morning at five, with the lark, 
And jump on my horse for a 
ride in the Park, 
Where I 
meet and escort the belle of the day, 
Whom I 
treat like a 
prim as, in every way. 
As I 
roam through the streets, and parade to and fro, 
With some gay, festive friend by my side, 
The Nobs, as 1 
pass, much politeness they show, 
As I 
come up they all stand aside. 
l'm the Swell of the Periol, 
Although I've a 
fortune, and position might get, 
I 
am not ambitious, nor wish for that yet: 
But one day I 
mean to astonish a 
few 
By leaving to the needy poor a 
thousand or two. 
I 
always en teavor, in scenes of distress, 
To do all the good that I 
can, 
Starvation, want and crime would be less 
If each mat would follow my plan. 
I'm the Swell of the Period, 
The Star of the West, 
The leader of Fashion, 
That must be confessed.

SHERRY. 
There's many songs been sung of late, 
In praise of various wines. 
Whilst some of other liquors state, 
Most suited to the times. 
In one they sing of Burgundy, 
Which some much love to see, 
For Moselle, Cliquot mid Champagne, 
But none of them suit me. 
ClIORUS. 
r • 
Sherry ! sherry 
sparkling Alen y! 
Is the wine to make you merry, 
When you do feel dull or heavy, 
Sherry sherry! sparkling sherry! 
Is the wine at any time, my boys, for me. 
When out at either rout or ball, 
Or if to sup or dine, 
They never trouble me and ask, 
For they all know my wine. 
The very best is saved for me, 
The sparkling, dry and pure, 
And in the highest circles I'm 
A 
well.known connoieseur. 
Spoken—Yes, I'm looked upon as a 
Solon, a 
Socrates, a 
per-
fect Solomon in judgemont. 
When wines arb in question no one 
dare to dispute my word, or— 
Sherry! & c. 
And just the same if I 
by chance, 
Stroll round unto my club, 
At billiards make a 
stroke or two, 
At whist, p'r'eps, take a

The waiters there, without one word, 
(The bell I 
need not ring) 
With noiseless step and smiling face, 
My fav'rite wine they bring.

THE OLD FRIENDS STILL. 
As time speeds on with his relentless wing, 
lie is bringing a 
change to all, 
The daisies peep from the lap of spring. 
And the oak leaves fade and fall, 
The new ones grow old and the old depart. 
And the years their cycles fill; 
The friends that are new may be kind and true 
But give me the old friends still. 
The friends that are new 
May be kind and true. 
But give me the old friends still. 
The friends that I 
loved when the spring was born, 
That were true when the summer died, 
That were still unchanged thro' the ebb and flow 
Of my life's unstable tide, 
The flower that blooms in sun's warm ray, 
May fade when the night is chill, 
The friends that are new may be kind and true, 
But give me the old friends still. 
The friends, &e. 
Oh! give me a 
clasp of the same warm hand, 
That I 
felt in the days of yore, 
And give me the heart that time has proved, 
Is true to the inmost core; 
For time speeds on and friends are few, 
Whom the void in the healt can fill, 
The friends that are new may be kind and true, 
But give me the old friends still.

And of that school A 1,

And through life gaily run. 
At the clubs in town I'm styled XL, 
The gayest, smartest little swell; 
Free as the air and ever gay,

As through the Parks we go; 
Strolling round the Serpentine, 
Then on Rotten Row.

We dance and sing, in mirth rejoice; 
No rude remarks pass on our way.

OUT OF THE FRYING-PAN, INTO THE FTTLT1  
Pity my sorrow and melt at my woes, 
What I've put up with you would not suppose, 
how I've been treated and snubbed all along, 
Listen to me and I'll tell in my song; 
When but a 
schoolboy tho' trying my best, 
In the last form I 
continued to aest, 
Getting well flogged when I 
tried to rise higher, 
Twas out of the frying pan into the fire. 
Out of the frying pan, out of the frying pan, 
Perhaps you may fall, if too high you aspire. 
Out of the frying-pan, out of the frying-pan, 
Out of the frying-pan, into the fire. 
When tired of leading a 
bachelor's life, 
Looking around me I 
sought for a 
wife, 
Met with an angel with manners so soft, 
Face like a 
cherub's that sits up aloft. 
Oh ! how I 
picture our livcs fn-e 
from care, 
Happy as Dicky-birds up in the air, 
But such a 
temper had darling Maria 
Twas out of the frying-p . n 
into the fire. 
Out of the frying pan, 
Doating, on children, to badies endeared, 
happy was I 
when first twins appear'd 
But the next year they were triplets we had, 
Somehow or other I 
wasn t 
so glad ; 
Now at my table twelve mouths do I 
see. 
Hungry and open and waiting for me, 
Why did 1 
ever to marriage aspire 
Twas out of the frying-pan into the fire. 
Once I 
bought shares in a 
line that they made, 
Twenty per cent was the dividend paid, 
Crash went the bubble, my savings entire, 
Went out of the frying-pan into the fire. 
Out of the frying-pan, dre.

If a 
damsel by chance in the streets I 
should meet, 
And my eyes hap' to wander that way, 
My wife will remark that's a 
dozen at least, 
At whom you've been staring to-day; 
Who is she, you know, I'm certain of that, 
Don't say she is nothing to you, 
Very well if she's not, it's suspicious at least, 
Don't stare then, but come along do. 
Cho.—Come along do, &e. 
To the British Museum I 
took her, one day, 
To study the classical nude, 
She thought that Venus and Jupiter were 
Underdressed and decidedly rude. 
The beauties of Venus I 
tried to point out, 
When into a 
temper she flew, 
She's worse than Mazeppa, it's awful, she said, 
I'm ashamed, sir, so come along do. 
Cho.—Come along do, cte. 
Now whatever I 
do, and wherever I 
go, 
I've been so annoyed, that now I 
have made up my mind the same sort of game 
Upon the old lady to try; 
So whenever she stops at a 
shop for a 
look 
At a 
bonnet, or anything new, 
I 
use her own words, as I 
tug at her arm, 
And say, " Sarah Ann, come along do." 
Cho.—Come along do, t&e. 
I 
hope I 
amuse you in singing this song, 
For somehow or other I 
know 
ThAt if my old lady she should come along, 
She'd say it's time for me to go; 
But there's one consolation, my song's nearly done, 
And p'rhaps you are thinking so too, 
But I'll settle the matter, and say to myself, 
" 
Old fellow, now come along do." 
Cho.—Come along do, &c.

I SHOULD LIKE TO BE AN ALLIGATOR. 
In days gone by I 
did the swell, 
And patronized the " Zoo," 
In love too with a 
darling fell, 
A 
charming girl named Lou. 
But neither Zoo, nor charming Lou, 
Shall I 
ever see attain, 
I'm now devoted to the blues, 
My life is full of pain, pain, pain. 
ClIORUS. 
I 
should like to be an Alligator, 
Or a 
curly Crocodile, Crocodile, dile dile, 
Bdt Pd rather be an Alligator, 
Than be mourning melancholy 
For my own true love. 
To do the Zoo," was one of Lou's 
Most favourite of wishes, 
And so we used to go and view, 
The birds, the beasts, and fishes 
And whilst we watched the love birds, 
And the pretty doves a 
cooing, 
We settled that St. Pancras church 
Should shortly end our wooing, wooing, wooing. 
I 
should like to be, ttc. 
One day Lon's gave the monkey nuts, 
And because they turned out dulling, 
One tore my darling's chignon off, 
And then pulled out the stuffing. 
It gave my darling such a 
turn, 
Shie never could recover, 
And two days after I 
did learn, 
I'd lost my own true lover, lover, lovt r. 
I 
should like to be, & e. 
So now I 
roam dejected, 
Whilst the Bela. and Crocodile, 
Can wag their tails 
ontented, 
.And the ugly Monkeys smile ; 
The Cockatoo and Kangaroo, 
Seem not to care a 
jot 
But the curly Alligator seems, 
The sleepkst of the lot.

but sleep, I 
should forget my woe, But as I 
can't

THE MAN WITH THE INDIA RUBBER FACE. 
Strange freaks of nature are beheld 
As thro' this world we stray, 
You have the Siamese twins seen, 
And Aztecs I 
daresay, 
it is my lot be ore you now, 
In turn to take my place, 
And prove that I 
the man am with 
The India rubber face. 
When I 
was born the nurse I'm told, 
Di I 
quite with laughter shake, 
For I 
at her gave such a 
look, 
That made her old sides ache. 
The Doctor said it is a 
face, 
As sure as I'm no lubber, 
The face of this unrivaled child, 
Is made of India rubber. 
As I 
grew up, uneumber'd scrapes 
I 
managed to get in, 
You see my phiz against me was, 
Tho' I'd a 
heap of tin. 
When I 
passed up or down a 
street 
I 
had to mend my pace, 
For urchins would shout out Oh, ray I 
The India rubber face. 
I've manage] tho' to get a 
N\ ife, 
A 
very pretty lass, 
And I've a 
son who likely is 
his dad soon to surpass. 
He pulls a 
mouth from ear to ear, 
Ills nose doth meet his chin, 
One eye is nigh out of his head, 
The other has gone in. 
I'm going now, but ere I'm gone 
Permit me to inquire 
If I 
have plelsed you, if l've not, 
The fat's all in the fire. 
But if in looking round, I 
can 
Sweet satisfaction trace, 
Right happy will the man be with 
Th • India rubb:rat face.

THAT BLESSED BABY. 
What shall I 
do ? where shall I 
go ? 
I'm ruined, there's no doubt on't, 
I've got into a 
precious fix, 
And never shall get out on't. 
Now, just look here, don't this look queer, 
As true as my name is Aby, 
I 
met a 
girl, with hair in curl, 
Who left me with this baby. 
This girl, I 
say has run away, 
I 
wish that I 
could find her, 
For her, I 
swear, I 
wouldn't care, 
But she's left this babe behind her. 
'Twas in a 
six cent omnibus 
I 
met this lovely creature, 
Her form was plump, her face was fair, 
And love lit every feature, 
Though jammed up tight, I 
couldn't quite 
Avoid to gently press her. 
I 
caught her eye and thought oh my, 
She's a 
beauty, bless her 
Her crinoline came o'er my knees, 
And caused a 
strange sensation, 
A sort of loving—you know what— 
Too sweet for explanation. 
The baby coo'd, and in the mood 
I 
felt I 
couldn' stop it, 
So pinched its chin and made it grin 
And called it pretty poppet. 
Do you love babies, sir? said she, 
I 
answered, Yes miss, dearly. 
Her eyes met mine and I 
felt charmed, 
In truth bewildered nearly.

THAT BLESSED BABY. —CONCLUDED. 
And so do I, she did reply, 
And this dear babe's my sister 
She leant to speak, so on the cheek, 
I 
own I 
gently kissed her. 
At the Morrisania road, said she, 
I'm going to get out, sir, 
But hold dear babe while I 
get down, 
Pray, mind what you're about, sir. 
Said I, All right—said she, hold tight, 
Be careful as you may be. 
Then lack-a-day, she ran away 
And left me with the baby. 
The little brat began to cry, 
Some one bawled out, Old chap, 
I 
think you'd better make haste home, 
And give the child some pap! 
I 
cried, Police, but one said, Cease, 
You're rightly serv'd, it may be, 
It's got your nose, so I 
suppose 
You're Father of the baby. 
Good gracious is there no one here 
Can tell me what to do now? 
My way is anything but clear 
This trouble to get through now; 
Now ladies do, be kind and true, 
Will not regret it may be, 
For heaven's sake, one of you take 
Myself and this dear baby. 
How sad I 
say to run away, 
I've tried all night to find her, 
For her I 
swear, I 
wouldn't care, 
If she hadn't left this baby behind her.

THE WATER-FALL. 
The Dark Girl Dressed in Blue." 
As you walk about the town on any Winter day, 
You'll see the lads and lasses dre,sed up in fashions gay ; 
Sonic are short, and some are stout, while others are lean 
and tall, 
But the one that always takes my eye is the girl with the 
water-ha 
CHORUS. 
She's a 
nice gal, f'1 de diddle I 
do: 
Red hot, fol de diddle a. 
She goes about, dress'd up in silk, distended with a 
hoop ; 
She wears a 
cunning jockey hat, shap'd like a 
sugar scoop ; 
And then, is fastened, on each side, two things like billiard-
balls : 
But it's only a 
sign for you to follow the gal with the 
water-all. 
She's a 
nice gal, &c. 
The other day I 
chanced to stroll to Taylor's for ice-cream : 
My feelings were beyond control-1 
thought ' twas but a 
dream : 
Tills angel she came strolling in—for beans did loudly bawl : 
I 
thought ' twas such a 
vulgar sin for the gal with the 
water-fall. 
She's a 
nice gal, &c. 
The way she shovelled down the fruit, I 
tell you, wasn't 
slow; 
And when she thought she had enough, she rose and turned 
to go. 
When something from her head there fell—'twas neither 
light nor small— 
The pepper caused this gal to sneeze, and she dropped her 
water-fall. 
She's a 
nice gal, & c. 
I 
very politely picked it up. Just give that here, she said. 
She took it with an angry frown.and clapped it on her head. 
She saw me laugh, and gave me a 
look which caused my 
flesh to crawl ; 
And says she : Young man, beware how you play with a 
lady's water-fall. 
She's a 
nice gal, &e,

THE PARLOR BLIND. 
A short time since, a 
friend of mine, a 
clerk, call'd Mister 
Brown, 
Resolved on breathing carbon pure, by living out of town; 
For be it known, his screw was rais'd some thousand dollars 
a 
year, 
Upon the strength of which a 
Mrs. Brown did soon appear. 
He each suburban district search'd, week after week he 
tried, 
To get a 
house that suited him, within an easy ride ; 
And Brown's ambition always was to get if he could find, 
A nice wide parlor window, and a 
nice white parlor blind. 
At length he came across a 
row of houses, small, but neat, 
Near Brooklyn, likewise Coney Island, a 
very snug retreat ; 
Exactly built alike they were, large windows and three 
floors, 
But the outsides not quite finisli'd, and no numbers on the 
doors; 
The only one to let he took, and half a 
quarter's rent 
lie paid down as a 
guarantee, of future good intent, 
And wanting shortly to go in, and not to be behind, 
He took the measure for his wife to make the parlor bi:nd. 
A 
fortnight saw them settled down as happy as could be, 
At live o'clock Brown regularly toddled home to tea ; 
Then smoked his mild Havanna, with the parlor window up, 
And read the news, or chatted till the time arrived to sup. 
Now it happened that a 
nice young man, who, living op-
posite, 
Enjoyed himself the same as Brown, and had a 
perfect 
right ; 
'Eley often met each other's gaze, which rankled in Brown's 
mind, 
When annoyed at being overlooked, he'd draw the parlor 
blind. 
At length the gaze of this young man took such a 
hold on 
Brown, 
[1] 
THE PARLOR BLIND.—[CoxrumED. 
And worked him up to such a 
pitch, that often he felt 
down ; 
His wife remarked the change in him, but could not under 
stand 
That the green-eyed monster jealousy had taken him in 
band ; 
Until one morn be said before he to the office went, 
These few, but simple words, which conveyed well what 
he meant : 
They were, My dear, when I 
am out, I 
hope you'll bear in 
in 
Under no pretence whatever to draw up the parlor blind. 
Now we know business can't be regulated as it might, 
And so thought Brown, who at the office had to stay one 
night; 
When going home, and in his street, he a 
horrid vision saw 
A Hansom cab whizzed past him, and drove up to his door 
A man jumped out, and entered the house, says Brown 
Who can it be ? 
Oh! horrible suspicion—does he want my wife or me? 
In a 
small front garden opposite, a 
bush he crept behind, 
To watch the stranger's little game from behind the parlor 
blind. 
Brown seeing him divest himself of coat, and hat, and gloves 
Soliloquized, I 
thought as much, it isn't me she loves; 
It's evident another one to her bath equal charms, 
What would I 
for a 
pistol give, or any firearms. 
Large drops of perspiration stood, like peas, upon his brow, 
If he only had the villain there, what would he give him 
now ; 
While thinking how could women be so faithless and un-
kind, 
He saw the man embrace his wife behind the parlor blind. 
[2] 
,‘4 
THE PARLOR BLIND.—P.IoNcumED. 
The more he watched, the more he felt increasing was his 
wrath, 
For he saw the servant enter and spread the table cloth, 
Then bring up something on a 
dish, all smoking nice and 
hot, 
Impulsively Brown shouted, That's my supper, sir, you've 
got. 
And every mouthful that he took Brown wished it might 
him choke, 
But it didn't, for he finished it and soon commenced to 
smoke; 
Then mixed a 
glass of grog says Brown, By jove, he seems 
inclined 
To coolly make a 
night of it behind the parlor blind. 
Brown stand it could no longer now, out in the road he 
came, 
Picked up a 
large macadam stone and hurled it at the pane; 
Then crept up to the private-door as quiet as a 
pin, 
The man came out to see the cause, that instant Brown 
popped in. 
He rushed into the parlor straight, could scarce believe his 
eyes, 
His wife was nowhere to be seen, and judge of his surprise 
On coming to himself a 
bit, and somewhat cool, to find, 
Twas his next door-neighbor's house, servant, wife, and 
parlor blind.

I 
always was a 
timid man, 
And nervous from my birth, 
And nervousne=s I 
think is worse 
Than anything on earth : 
For go to do whate'er you will, 
You're sure to do it wrong, 
I 
hope it won't attack me now, 
And spoil me in my song. 
So, if you will attentive be, 
do the best I 
can, 
To tell to you the sorrows of 
A 
timid, nervous man. 
Cuoaus.—I'm nervous, I'm nervous, a 
timid, nervous man ; 
I 
am nervous, I'm nervous, a 
timid, nervous man. 
I 
met a 
most delightful girl, 
Out at a 
ball one night; 
I 
felt my peace of mind was gone, 
When first she came in sight ; 
Wanted to be introduced, 
And Brown soon did the job, 
By saying, " Miss Jetnima Green, 
My friend, young Richard Cobb." 
I 
said, " A lovely morning, miss; 
No, no! I 
don't mean that; 
It's night, of course, I'm quite aware, 
But,—have you seen the cat'1' 
I'm nervous, ex. 
No doubt, she thought it very strange, 
That I 
should talk such stuff, 
And as I 
stood, I 
felt that she 
Must think me quite a 
muff: 
I 
did not mend the matter much, 
When I 
turn'd round to say, 
" 
There's been a 
deal of weather, miss, 
About the town to-day ;" 
And, having made that sage remark, 
I 
sat down in a 
chair, 
Plump into Mrs. Johnson's lap, 
Whom I 
did not see there.

But what was my dismay, 
To find the waiter stood behind, 
And I'd upset his tray.

said, " Miss Green, will you oblige 
Me with the next quadrille ? 
As waltzes, polkas, I 
can't do, 
They always make me ill." 
But, lor' I 
I 
could not (lance at all, 
They pull'd me here and there, 
My foot caught in Jemima's dress, 
And that began to tear ; 
The trimming twisted round my legs, 
In such an awful way, 
That half a-dozen soon went down, 
And I 
among them lay.

rusli'd down-stairs to leave the house, 
A 
hat and coat I 
took, 
And not till I 
was nearly home, 
Did I 
once at them look ;

felt, 
When on the hat I 
found 
A 
servant's black cockade was there, 
And gold lace band all round ;

And liv'ry button t

In fact, it was the servant's hat 
And coat I 
took that night.

took them back, and got my own, 
And ere I 
left the door, 
There came from out the drawing-room 
Of laughter quite a 
roar. 
They put me down as " fool," of course, 
And dear Miss Green, no doubt, 
Thought me the greatest " spoon " that she 
had ever met when out. 
I 
lost the girl I 
doat upon, 
And made myself a

Because my nerves won't let me keep

NO TRUST. 
If I 
should trust each time I'm asked 
My stock would soon be gone, 
And I 
a 
bankrupt then become; 
For credit I'd get none ! 
Once I 
trusted all my friends, 
For, so they seemed to be, 
But when I 
asked them for my pay, 
They'd only laugh at me ! 
Then elsewhere they would trade for cash 
To me they would not come, 
So I 
lost my stock and lost my trade, 
And thus was near undone 
And now, my Friends, I 
sell for Cash, 
As cheap and good as can be, 
And though your trade l'd like to have, 
For cash it is; I'd thank ye. 
My weights are true, my measures just, 
And trade I 
seek most fervent; 
For smallest favors I 
will be 
Your very humble servant. 
Let's all adopt this golden rule, 
'Twill ease us oft of sorrow; 
To pay for what we want to-day, 
And trust not on the morrow.

WEBSTER'S BUSINESS MAN 
treats upon every topic incidental 
to the experience of a 
business man. 
While its main design is to instruct the 
reader in the details of commercial correspondence, the subject matter of these 
specimen letters embrace all points of interest to the general trader. 
Prominence has been given to banking, and the relationship between bank-
ers and their dealers, inasmuch as hundreds of thousands of persons main-
taining accounts of deposit and discount, are in ignorance of the duties of 
bankers and of the the rights and privileges of the dealer. 
To the body of the work has been appended :-
1. A Glossary of the Technicalities of Commerce, or terms employed by mer-
cantile men at home and abroad, as a 
peculiar and distinctive language not 
familiar to the general reader. 
2. A table of moneys in which mercantile accounts are kept in various 
foreign countries, information all important to dealers in imported merchan-
dize and 
3. several forms of important documents not to be found in a 
majority of 
/works upon book-keeping.

bankers and traders, and has invariably met with their approval.

De Witt's Ten Cent Romances No. 90 
The Prince Corsair; 
OR 
THE THREE BROTHERS OF GUZAN, 
Fully as interesting as the most interesting book ever 
written, " The Arabian Nights." 
The adventures of the 
young Prince are inimitably described: whether he is 
ploughing the deep blue waves, at the head of his furious 
followers, or is lying senseless beneath the poisonous Upas 
tree— all is alike full of wondrous interest. 
Most marvel-
lous scenes, full of oriental detail, described with a 
minute-
ness and brilliancy that carries the reader's imagination 
captive. 
Fgr- For sale by all News Dealers; or sent, POST-PAID, to any a/-
di ess, on receipt of price, TEN CENTS.
