MACCABE'S EXCURSION TRAIN ; 
OR, TIIE TRIALS OF A RAILWAY PORTER, 
Ant.—" 
King of the Cannibal Islands." 
EVER since the world began, 
There never was, nor ever can 
Be found such a 
very useful man 
As a 
railway porter. 
He carries your lurrgage civilly, 
And never expects to get a 
fee, 
Though his hand will close quite readily 
If you slip in a 
small gratuity. 
When friends are on the platform parting, 
lie rings the bell when it's time for starting, 
And the last man you see, as away you're darting, 
Is the railway porter. 
VENTRILOQUIAL CONVERSATION WITH THE PASSENGERS.—
Start-
ing the Train— Right ! — Train off— Incidents of Railway Travel 
—Pleasant and Unpleasant Fellow- passengers—Arrival at Sta-
tion—Pull Up. 
And when the train is pulling up, 
At a 
station on the line to stop, 
And the passengers want to know how far 
They've come, and wonder where they are; 
The porter shouts the name of the station, 
But you only hear the termination, 
So on that point you never get information 
From the railway porter. 
VENTRILOQUIAL CONVEESATION.—The Fat Old Gentleman who 
wants more Room— The Loamcions Old Lady who is anxious 
about her Luggacre—The Young Swell who wants to Smoke, 
and the Asthmatical Gentleman who ohjects—The Tipsy Man 
who wants the Refreshment Station—And the Yankee who 
chaffs the Porter. 
45 
So ever since the world ben-an, 
There never was, nor ever can 
Be found such a 
very useful man 
As a 
railway porter. 
THE GALLOPPING HORSE 
OR, TERRY 0.:111:LLIGAN. 
A broth of a 
boy—full of good humor and scientill 
WIC( 
Written and composed by FREDERIC MACCADE., 
On! my gallopping horse ! 
Oh! my gallopping horse ! 
I'm at home on the top of my gallopping horse! 
And I 
never can meet 
With a 
tune half so sweet 
As that made by the feet 
Of my galloping horse; 
As there he goes prancing, 
And here he comes dancing, 
And rearing and tearing so proudly and strong, 
It is so delightful, 
And makes me feel quite full 
Of daring, don't caring, while rushing along 
On my gallopping horse, 
On my gallopping horse, 
I'm at home on the top of my gallopping horse; 
And I 
never can meet 
With a 
tune half so sweet 
As that made by the feet 
Of my gallopping horse. 
Oh 
I 
my gallopping horse! 
Oh ! my gallopping horse! 
There was never his equal for mettle or force; 
He's a 
spirited racer 
And bold steeple-chaser, 
My far-leaping, high- flying, galloppinfz, horse. 
lIe goes smashing and crashing, • 
Aml splashing and dashing, 
Straight at a 
deep ditch, a 
rough fence, or high wall, 
Not badly though madly, 
All obstacles gladl:, 
That come in his way, he goes full at them all. 
Oh my gallopping horse, etc. 
Now I'll draw rein with reason, 
And just take my ease on 
The back of this wonderful gallopping horse ; 
And I'll own I 
was wrong 
When I 
put it so strong, 
That there wasn't his equal for mettle or force; 
(1) 
GALLOPPING HORSE.—Continued. 
There is such another 
That makes as much bother 
In rearing and tearing as ever did mine; 
That prances as gladly, 
And dances as madly, 
And who's this nag's owner you'll never divine. 
On his gallopping horse, etc. 
Each man's hobby, of course, 
Is his galloping horse ; 
He believes there's no steed of such mettle or force • 
And when he's astride 
Of his hobby, he'll ride 
Just as wildly as I 
do on my hobby-horse ; 
If you ever endeavor 
To stop him, you'll never 
Succeed in persuading him out of his course. 
He thinks he's so clever, 
No logic whatever 
Can reason him down from his own hobby-horse. 
hats his gallopping horse, 
That's my gallopping horse, 
That's yours, mine, and every man's gallopping horse ; 
And we never can meet 
With a 
tune half so sweet 
As that made by the feet of our own hobby-horse. 
BLOW GENTLY, WINDS, BLOW GENTLY. 
Written and composed by FREDERIC MACC ADE. 
As I 
wander through the fields where the sweet flowers are 
growing, 
Or down in the meadow where the streandet is flowing, 
I 
sing that my love may come safe back to me— 
Blow gently, winds, blow gently, while my love is on the sea ; 
For oh! he is coming, coming back to me— 
Blow gently, winds, blow gently, while my love is on the sea. 
Though the sky is fair and calm above, in sunlight brightly 
glowing, 
And through the softly waving trees the mildest breeze is blow-
ing, 
Far, far upon the ocean, ah ! what storms may there not be 
Blow gently, winds, blow gently, while my love is on the sea ; 
For oh ! he is coming, coming back to me— 
Blow gently, winds, blow gently, while my love is on the sea.

LADY, RISE. 
Written and composed by FREDERIC MACCABE. 
LADY, rise from thy peaceful pillow, 
And say farewell to me ; 
Far away on the roiling billow, 
Ere the morn, I 
will be. 
Sounds of war call me afar, 
And thottoli with thee I 
fain would stay, 
When honor calls I 
must away. 
Lady, rise from thy peaceful pillow, 
And say farewell to me; 
Far away on the rolling billow. 
Ere the morn, I 
will be. 
Lady, rise from thy peaceful pillow, 
And breathe a 
prayer for me, 
When far away beyond the rolling billow, 
I 
fight for home and thee. 
And if I 
fall, my constant soul 
E'en at the gate of death will stay, 
Till thine shall flee from earth away. 
Lady, rise from thy peaceful pillow, 
And say farewell to me ; 
Far away on the rolling billow, 
Ere the morn, I 
must be. 
Lady, rise from thy peaceful pillow, 
And greeting give to me, 
When once again across the rolling billow, 
I 
return to thee. 
All the brave are on the wave, 
And though with thee I 
fain would stay, 
When honor cal!s I 
must away. 
Lady, rise from thy peaceful pillow, 
And say farewell to me; 
Far away on the rolling billow 
Ere the morn, I 
must be.

Y'HEAVE 110 ! A SAILOR 'S YARN ; 
OH, JACK JUNK. 
Every inch a 
Sailor. 
Any one who has been aboard ship, and observed sailors at work turning 
the capstan, removing a 
large sail, or doing any duty which requires a 
puil 
all loge .her, must have remarked how they contrive to lighten their labor 
with a 
song and chorus; one sailor singing the sole, while at the end of 
every line the others all come in with `• Ye heave ho !" or " Cheerily, 
man ho !" or some other meaningless yet characteristic phrase. 
These 
songs have no sequence, each line being irrelevant to, and independent of, 
the preceding cue. 
Written and composed by FREDERIC H ACCABE. 
A LL folks, old and young, who— 
Y'heave ho! 
Choose to come and listen awhile unto me ; 
I'm going to make bold to— 
Y'heave ho ! 
Spin a 
sailor's yarn, all about the deep blue sea. 
CHORUS. 
With a 
yleave ho—i—o ! with y'heave ! 
Our Captain had a 
daughter,— 
'heave ho! 
Which her name it was Eliza, with beautiful blue eyes, 
And at school they had taught her— 
Y'heave ho ! 
For to play on the piano and singing likewise. 
With a, etc. 
The boatswain was my messmate,— 
rheave ho ! 
And he fell in love with Eliza, and she with him also 
To the Captain he confessed it,— 
Y'heave ho! 
But the captain he forbid him in the cabin for to go. 
With a, etc. 
Says Eliza to her father,— 
rheave ho! 
" 
Without my dear boatswain I'll never live content." 
Says the Captain, " Miss, I'd rather— 
Y'heave ho ! 
Throw you overboard to thp fishes than ever Ed consent." 
With a, etc. 
Well, Eliza tool.: a 
notion,— 
Y'heave ho! 
As her father was so cruel, she'd be revenged on him ;

Now you at love as is railers,— 
Y'heave ho! 
Remember this cruel captain, and don't do like him, 
And you girls as like sailors,—

Don't you fall in love before you learn to swim.

M ACCADE'S LAND OF DREAMS. 
Written and composed by FEEDERIC M ACCABE. 
IN 
the pleasant summer ev'ning 
I 
lie beneath the shade, 
Watching the shadows 
That dance on the meadows, 
When the day begins to fade. 
In the pleasant summer ev'ning 
I 
lie beneath the shade, 
Watching the shadows - 
That dance on the meadows 
When the day begins to fade. 
Then a 
sweet remembrance comes to me, 
Like a 
long- forgotten strain 
Of music awaking, 
And freshly breaking 
Over my heart again. 
In visions of the past 
I 
see my love arise, 
And in my dreaming 
I 
feel the beaming 
Of her soft, compassionate eyes. 
Ah ! thus may sadden'd hearts renew 
Their life's pure morning beams, 
On the past to ponder, 
And softly wander 
Into the land of dreams.

MANY A TUE. 
, 
Written and composed by FREDERIC Meccas& 
In my home beyond the sea, 
Many a time ! ah, many a time ! 
My sister sang sweet songs to me, 
Many a time ! ah, many a time! 
IN 
my home beyond the sea, 
Many a 
time, 
My little sister sang to me, 
Many a time ; 
And, wherever now I 
roam, 
The memory of her voice will come; 
I hear her singing still at home, 
Many a 
time. 
She kiss'd me then, and whispered low— 
" 
Brother, stay ;" 
Into the world I longed to go, 
Far away. 
And thought no sorrrow could destroy 
The fullness of my hope and joy, 
When I 
was a 
little boy, 
Long ago. 
Weary now and travel worn, 
I 
would fain 
To my childhood's home return 
Once again; 
For I 
know that she is there, 
My little sister, pure and fair, 
Whose voice was with me everywhere, 
Many a 
time.

And the name of this maiden so fair and bright,

Like the sunlight in the skies,

And the light within those eyes 
Of the maid I

see 
All things bright and beautiful to me; 
And the name of this nniden so fair and bright 
Is " My Heart's Delight! My Heart's Delight !" 
Like the smiling Spring, advancing 
To deck the earth with flowers, 
Like golden sunbeams dancing 
In the forest's leafy bowers, 
Is the maid I 
love; in her I 
see 
All things bright and beautiful to me; 
And the name of this maiden so fair and bright 
Is " My Heart's Delight I

THE FASCINATING ELLOW. 
By FREDERIC MACCABE. 
Of all the sources of delight, I'll tell, with your permission, 
The one that lifts a 
young gent to the height of his ambition, 
IL 
is to be the constant theme of ladies' conversation, 
And know that they have given him this flatt'ring appellation. 
CHORUS. 
Fine fellow ! great swell ! 0 I 
fascinating fellow! 
It is delightful to be called a 
fascinating fellow. 
I 
don't care what the men may think of me, to love or hate me, 
It all depends upon the term by which they designate me ; 
Amon ,, us modern, fashionable fellows, there are no men 
Who would object to such a 
complimentary cognomen. 
Fine fellow I 
great swell, &c. 
A 
man may be quite handsome, and yet not fascinating, 
It's in my style and winning ways I'm so insinuating; 
Of course I'm sometimes sneer'd at by the stupid, grave mu?. 
serious, 
But to my reputation, that's in no way deleterious. 
Fine fellow ! great swell, (Ix. 
It's pleasing to a 
fellow's pride to be call'd " Lady-killer," 
And ' tis my greatest triumph, as a 
fascinating fellow, 
To see the ladies droop their eyes, and watch them softly sighing. 
By jingo ! that to me, is really very gratifying. 
Fine fellow t 
great w4l, 
CEASE THY REPOSING. 
Oh! cease thy reposing, 
Night's stars are closing, 
Dreamily dozing, 
Into the day. 
Gaily awaking, 
Slumber forsaking, 
While morn is breaking, 
Let us away. 
Longing to cheer thee, 
And to be near thee, 
Hoping to hear thee, 
Hither I 
came. 
Soft words, in sighing, 
Cadences eying, 
Echoes in flying, 
Breathe thy dear name, 
Oh I 
cease thy reposing, i4rc 
When slumber bath found me, 
And lovingly hound me, 
Hovering around me, 
Thy spirit seems. 
Silently blessing, 
Mutely confessing,r, 
Thy soul caressing. 
Mine in my dreams. 
When moonlight is beaming, 
And bright stars are g.eaming 
Whilst thou art dreaming, 
Haply of me. 
Then, should the morrow, 
Wake thee to sorrow, 
Come, love, and borrow 
Gladness from me. 
0 I 
cease thy reposing, & c.

Of grief though each man gets his share, 
Increasing it he's oft employed ; 
Many a 
trouble, and many a 
care, 
We make ourselves, we might avoid; 
But, oh I 
in doing all we can 
To spoil the memory of delight, 
The safest and the surest plan 
Is staying out too late at night. 
Youth, they say, will have its fling, 
But nature has this certain law, 
That age must pay the reckoning 
If the account we overdraw. 
But t) be heathy, wealthy, and wise, 
The proverb, if translated aright, 
Is early to bed and early to rise, 
And don't stay out too late at night,

BUTTERCUPS AND DAISIES. 
Written and composed by FREDERIC MACCABE. 
PRETTY little flowers in plenty grow; 
Buttercups and daisies! 
Buttercups and daisies! 
All among the grass, so gayly, 0 ! 
Buttercups and daisies grow. 
Thorns and weeds our lives surround, 
Naught for that care I. 
Brightest blossoms still abound, 
And content am I. 
Pretty little, etc. 
Pretty little children love to play, 
All among the daisies, 
The buttercups and daisies; 
With their happy faces bright and gay, 
Pretty little flowers are they. 
Though this life is full of care, 
Naught for that care I, 
Grief and joy alike we share, 
And content am I.

LOVE, BEAUTIFUL LOVE; 
OR; Miss M k.I11- M AY. 
A 
good-naturedly-satirical young lady, who will chat pleasantly, and sing 
an unsentimental song. 
"Written and composed by FREDERIC MACCADE. 
LOVE, beautiful love! is a 
vision of joy 
To the blushing maid and the bashful boy; 
And a 
sweet little cottage or humble tent 
Is all they want—but the rent 1— the rent! 
Is the landlord's cry, 
And he won't take a 
tear, nor he won't take a 
sigh. 
Love is beautiful love when the baby plays, 
And charms the fond pair with its sweet little ways ; 
Then gold could not purchase its tiny toes, 
But the shoemaker calls, and before be goes, 
Suppose he will 
Not leave the house till you've paid his bill. 
Love was once a 
mischievous boy, ' tis said, 
Without shoes on his feet or cap on his head, 
But he's very genteel, and it must be confessed, 
Love's a 
very nice boy when he's fed and well dress'd, 
Then love will bring 
A 
thousand joys in a 
wedding ring.

And our home in sight appearing, 
To the haven safely steering, 
In the evening sunset's glow;

HOW TO ASK AND TO HAVE. 
Br SAMUEL LOVElt. 
" 
On ! it's time I 
should speak to your mother, 
Dear Mary," says I. 
" 
Ah I 
don't speak to my mother," says Mary, 
Beginning to cry; 
" 
For my mother says men are deceivers, 
And I 
know she will never consent; 
She says, maids in a 
hurry who marry, 
At leisure repent." 
" 
Then supposing I 
speak to your father, 
Dear Mary," says I. 
" 
No ! don't speak to my father," says Mary, 
Beginning to cry; 
" 
For my father he loves me so dearly, 
He'd never consent I 
should go ; 
If you speak to my father," says Mary, 
" 
He's sure to say no." 
" 
Then how shall I 
get you, my jewel, 
Dear Mary '1" says I. 
" 
If your father and mother's so cruel, 
Och! surely I'll (lie." 
" 
Ah ! then never say die, dear," says Mary,

TEL WHISTLING THIEF.

When Pat came o'er the hills his colleen fair to see, 
His whistle, loud and shrill, his signal was to be. 
Oh! Mary, the mother cried, there's some one whistling surf, 
Oh ! Mother, you know, it's the wind that's whistling througi 
the door. 
(Whistles 
Garry Owen.) 
I've lived a 
long time, Mary, in this wide world, my dear, 
But the wind to whistle like that, I 
never yet did hear. 
But, mother, you know, the fiddle hangs close behind the chink, 
And the vin.d upon the strings is playing a 
tune, I 
think. 
(Dog barks.) 
The dog is barking now, and the fiddle can't play that tune. 
But, Mother, you know that dogs will bark, when they see the 
moon. 
Now, how can he see the moon, when you know he's old and 
blind'? 
Blind dogs can't see the moon, nor fiddles be played by the 
windy 
(Pig grunts.) 
And now there is the pig uneasy in his mind. 
But, Mother, you know, they say that pigs can see the wind. 
That's all very well in the day, but then I 
may remark 
That pigs, no more than we, can see anything in the dark. 
sow, I'm not such a 
fool as you think, I 
know very well it is 
Pat, 
Get out I 
you whistling thief, and get along home out o' that. 
And. you, be off to your bed, and don't bother me with your 
tears; 
For, tho' I've lost my eyes, I 
have not lost my ears. 
Momu,. 
Now, Boys, too near the house don't courting go, d'ye mind ? 
\Thiess you're certain sure the old woman's both deaf and blind; 
The days when they were young, forget they never can; 
They're sure to tell the difference 'twixt wind, fiddle, pig, dog..

IT SERVES YOU RIGHT. 
Composed by FRED H IGGINS. 
So very strange to me it seems, 
That bye words are the rage, 
I 
cl,n't know where you get them 'from, 
Perhaps tis off the stage; 
No matter where you travel now, 
By day as well as night, 
You're sure to hear some urchin cry, 
" 
My boy, it serves you right. 
CHORUS. 
It serves you right, it serves you right, 
Mv boy, it serves you right ; 
It drives me to distraction quite, 
When f 
ilks they say, " It serves you right.' 
A 
girl I 
took to Leicester Square, 
Tho Alhambra, I 
men, 
That she was acting on the square, 
Oh, little did I 
dream ; 
Until I 
squandered three pounds ten, 
Upon her in one night, 
She left me minus watch and chain, 
And said, it serves you ri,ht, 
It serves you right, &c. 
Invited to a 
hill one night, 
In my best I 
was att:red. 
Intending for to cut a 
shine, 
A lIansom Cab I 
hircd; 
Oh soon along the roads I 
was, 
The horse it reared and shied, 
And sent me sprawling in the mud, 
Whilst all the people cried:

My spirits to revive, 
And being rather flush of cash, 
The game I 
kept alive ; 
ljnil one morn while sea-bathing, 
Oh ! that unlucky day, 
Some thieves close by my clothes they took, 
And bolted clean away. 
Spoken.— And I 
was left in the water shivering while all 
the people laughed at me and said,—

Upon a

A something seized hold of me here 
And held me precious tight. 
Spoken.—I 
turned round and discovered it Avis a 
large dog 
and then her Pa laid into me with a 
great biz stick, and said 
It serves you right, ike. 
When folks they say it serves you right, 
It makes me feel so wild, 
It makes me feel so nervous, too, 
I 
can't be reconciled ; 
So now, kind friends, I 
must say, 
I

And if that I

THE LAND OF DREAMS. 
SUNSHINE AFTER RAIN 
I 
left my love in Ireland, 
In poverty and pain ; 
The tears hung heavy in my eves, 
But hers came down like rain; 
I 
gave her half of all I 
had, 
Repressed the rising sigh ; 
For, thinking of the days to conic, 
I 
kept my courage high. 
"Farewell," I 
said, " if seasons pass, 
And sunshine follows rain, • 
And morning dawns on darkest night, 
You'll see me back again." 
I 
left my love in Ireland, - 
And sailed the stormy sea, 
To earn my bread by daily toil, 
An honest man and free. 
I 
wrought and strove from morn to night, 
And saved my little store; 
And every summer gave Inc wealth, 
And made the little more. 
At length I 
bought the field T 
plough'd, 
The sunshine followed rain. 
The morning dawned on heavy night, 
And I 
went back agian. 
I 
sought my love in Ireland, 
And brought her o'er the sea, 
And happy man, a 
happy wife, 
To bless my home and me. 
My farm is large, my wants are small, 
I 
bid my care depart, 
And sit beneath my own nal: t 
rep 
With proud and ,
2rat  
oft: 1 
heart. 
The children smiling rouml the board, 
Xe'er ask for bread in vain ; 
'Tis balmy morning after night, 
'Tis sunshine after rain. 
By SAMUEL LOVER. 
There is it land where fancy's twining 
Her flow'rs around life's fading tree, 
Where light is ever softly shining, 
Like sunset o'er a 
tranquil sea. 
'Tis there thou dwell'st in beauty's brightness, 
More fair than aught on earth e'er seems, 
'Tis there my heart feels most of lightness. 
There in the lovely Land of Dreams, 
There in the lovely Land of Dreams. 
'Tis there in groves I 
often meet thee, 
A.nd wander thro' the sylvan shade, 
While I 
in gentlest accents greet thee, 
My own, my sweet, my constant maid 
There by sonic fountain fair reposing, 
Where all around so tranquil seems, 
We wait the golden evening's closing, 
There, in the lovely Land of Dreams. 
But when the touch of earthly waking, 
Hath broken slumber's sweetest spell, 
Those fabled joys of fancy's making, 
Are in my heart remember'd ; 
The day in all its sunshine splendor, 
Less fair to me than midnight seems, 
When visions shed a 
light more tenders, 
Around the lovely Laud of Dreams.

As over the ground we roll, 
When the snow drift breaks 
In silvery flakes, 
Beside our coriole. 
When wrapt in buffaloes, soft and warm, 
With mantle and tippet tight, 
We cheerily cleave the fleecy storm, 
Or skim in the cold moonlight. 
Merrily sound, &c. 
Merrily, merrily sound the bells 
Upon the wind without. 
-When the wine is mulled, 
And the waffle culled,

Around the hickory fire.

'TWAS a 
lovely summer's day, 
And the birds were singing gay, 
While the flow'rs fill'd the air with odor sweet, 
Strolling leisurely along, 
humming some old plaintive song, 
A charming little maiden I 
chanced to meet; 
She had eyes of bonny blue, 
And her cheeks a 
roseate hue, 
Like a 
fairy flitting thro' a 
garden bower; 
011! she looked divinely fair, 
Picking posies here and there. 
While indeed she was herself the fairest flower. 
Pretty eyes of bonny blue, 
All my heart I .-
zive to you; 
Oh ! she looked so sweet and fair, 
With her neck and shoulders hare ; 
And my happy heart her image still embowers, 
I 
am like the little b2e, 
Kissing every flow'r I 
see, 
Since the day I 
met my love among the flowers. 
Ali enraptured I 
stood there, 
And I 
know it wasn't fair, 
For the blush went from the rose into her cheek ; 
Turning round he seemed to smile, 
But with modesty the while, 
And respect and duty bade me then to speak: 
Pray excuse me, Miss, said I, 
But as I 
was passing by— 
Oh! I 
found this plain gold ring, and thought ' twas yours 
Then she smiling, answered, no, 
Still she never bid we go, 
So we stood and talked awhile among the flowers. 
Pretty eyes, etc. 
Viewing first the setting sun, 
Then we saw the rising moon, 
Sitting side by side upon the portico, 
While upon her little hand 
I 
had placed the golden band, 
And was waiting for her answer, yes or no ; 
Surely love was en the wing, 
Cupid there came wandering, 
And NVVS seeking shelter from the dewy showers, 
When he saw each loving heart, 
Loathing evermore to part, 
Then he tied the knot of love among the flowers. 
Pretty eyes, etc. 
PRETTY LITTLE JESSIE. 
Written and Composed by W EL. IL ..
i.LELIANTT. 
On have you never met with pretty Jessie, 
She's the sweetest girl in town, 
And the summer of her smile would set you crazy, 
With hair and eyes so brown. 
If you should smile upon her, 
She'd tremble with delight, 
And deem it all an honor— 
Her sweet face blushing bright; 
! 
you should see my pretty little Jessie, 
liar beauty shames the rose, 
She's fairer than the lily— 
The sweetest flower that grows. 
enonus. 
My heart with joy is dancing, 
With happiness Da prancing, 
Oh ! may the joy of life forever bless thee, 
Lovely queen of every rose. 
Surpassing is my Jessie— 
The sweetest flower that grows. 
Now I 
have seen the dewdrop hi the rosebud, 
Little stars drop from the skies, 
Like pretty Jessie when she wears a 
red hood, 
The dewdrops are her eyes ; 
Oh ! who would dare to crush her, 
A 
sweet and tender flower, 
And who would dare to hush her, 
While singing in her bower ; 
'Tis joy for me to sit beneath her window, 
And hear her sing her song ; 
When summer's perfumed winds blow, 
I'd 
it there all day lone-. 
My heart, etc. 
I 
sometimes think that I 
am going crazy, 
My ways I 
can't improve, 
For since the day I 
met with pretty Jessie, 
I 
fly on wings of love. 
I 
see the white- cap daisy 
its welcome to her bend, 
As well, the pink and posie, 
For Jessie is their friend. 
This evening she and I 
were in the garden— 
When I my suit did press ; 
And when I 
popped the question, • 
She blushingly answered, yes. 
My heart, etc.

TRIPPING down the valley, skipping o'er the lea, 
Goes a 
little maiden just as fair as maid can be; 
Like a 
plume of raven is the bright sheen of her hair; 
Happy as a 
little queen is darling Dora Dare. 
Mocking all the song birds as they sweetly sing, 
Hear the voice of winsome Dora through the valley ring; 
Waking sweetest echoes thro' the wildwood far and near, 
Waking love-born echoes in the hearts of all who hear. 
CHORUS. 
Sweet Dora Dare, my darling Dora Dare; 
Dora with the lilies of the valley in her hair; 
Darling little Dora, she's the fairest of the fair; 
My heart it will go pit-a-pat at sight of Dora Dare. 
All the lads are sighing at fair Dora's feet, 
Happy for a 
week at one bright smile of hers so sweet; 
If they think she loves them just because she drops a 
smile, 
They'll soon know that Dora Dare was fooling theta the while. 
What has passed between us, Dora Dare and I, 
Must be strictly confidential between you and I; 
When the summer comes again, my Dora Dare will wear 
Orange flowers with lilies of the valley in her hair. 
Sweet Dora Dare, etc.

I'M dreaming at eve, and the night vision shows, 
A 
picture so perfect and clear, 
Of a 
vine- covered cot, and beneath its warm roof, 
Are gather'd the friends I 
love dear. 
But a 
blithe little form stands apart from the rest 
With rosy cheeks dimpled and fair, 
And such bright laughing eyes, peeping out to the 
'Mid tresses of waving brown hair. 
CHOIIHS. 
Dreaming of you, little one, 
Dreaming of you, little one, 
While brightly the stars in the sky glimmer down, 
Dreaming of you!'little one. 
Where the shadows are long on the path mossy grown, 
Our footsteps have oft trod before, 
With the little maid's hand gently clasp'd in my own, 
I 
wander again as of old. 
But while her merry voice with its musical tone 
Is sounding so sweet on my ear, 
I 
awake at the dawn, the bright vision has flown, 
Whose memories still linger near. 
Dreaming of you, little one, 
Dreaming of you, little one. 
While brightly the stars in the sky glimmer down, 
Dreaming of you, little one. 
LOVELY MARTHA MAY., 
Written and composed by Wm. H. DELET/ANTL 
THE spring is here with flowers to cheer, 
The birds sing sweet to- day, 
The mead is green where she has been 
To while an hour away. 
That, little child on whom she smiled, 
Or kissed in childish play, 
Is not her own ; but that sweet one 
So loved Miss Martha May. 
CHORUS. 
Martha May, Martha mine, 
Sweet as flowers in May; 
The jesamine or eglantine 
light, 
Are not so bright and gay. 
If you but view the violet blue, 
.Then you shall see her eyes; 
Or hear a 
band of music grand, 
Then you shall hear her voice ; 
Or see a 
maid, though plain arrayed, 
Excel in beauty's, grace; 
Or see two roses dipped in snow, 
Then you shall see her face. 
Martha May, Martha mine, etc. 
Beside the mill upon the hill,; 
Where waters run alway, 
One afternoon in flowers' June 
I 
chanced that way to stray; 
A 
maiden mild roamed with a 
child, 
And both were bent on play ; 
The child said, " Martha, there's papa," 
Then ran to me straightway. 
Martha May, Martha trIne etc. 
Into my arms, with sweet alarms, 
The little child did run ; 
A 
maiden fair was waiting there, 
But followed after soon. 
I 
kissed the baby, the, the lady 
, 
Said, 
Oh I 
ain't you ashamed 7" 
The child said, " Martha, kiss papa." 
Now, who was to be blamed?

REMEMBER, dear Allie, the spring where we play'd, 
The farm near the murmuring grove, 
Where maids and their lovers at ev'ning oft stray'd, 
To hear gentle whispers of love 
Remember how oft with your hand clasped in mine, 
We have rambled the path to the spring, 
Where grow the sweet daisy and wild ivy vine, 
And nightingales sweetly did sing. 
CHORUS. 
'Tis here that I'm kneeling and weeping to-night, 
'Tis here that I'm weeping at day, 
While dreams of my darling so cheerful and bright, 
Are chasing my sad tears away. 
Remember, dear Allie, when years pass'd away, 
And we plighted lovers became, 
We rambled the path to the spring day by day, 
As others had oft done the same ; 
Remember the promise I 
won from you then, 
While I 
held you in joy to my heart, 
Come back to the spring, and be happy again, 
And promise no more to depart. 
'Tis here, etc. 
Remember, dear Mlle, our love of the past, 
With me ' tis as bright as of old; 
Come back to the spring, and we'll ramble and sing, 
While tales of affection are told; 
Remember the days when the light of thy gaze, 
Was the sweetest of sunshine to me ; 
Now lonely and weeping I'm here by the spring, 
My heart slowly breaking for thee. 
'Tis here, etc.

Teach us which path to keep, 
And love us fondly, dearly, 
Kiss papa, now; go sleep.

Dear mamma, tell me why 7

LITTLE PRAIRIE FLOWER. 
By W. H . 
DELEHANTY. 
THERE'S a 
pretty little girl in town, 
With the sweetest, bright blue eyes, 
And a 
winning smile that's all the while 
Like sunshine in the skies ; 
She has a 
wicked, killing way—her own, 
To hold you in her power; 
Then with her eyes she'll tantalize— 
Entrancing you the more— 
Until you seem wrapt in a 
dream— 
This little Prairie Flower. 
CHORUS. 
She's the. fairest of the fair, 
Sweetest of the sweet, 
Like a 
gem or jewel rare, 
Perfect and complete; 
But she was born out West, 
Where red men once held power; 
But she had come to girlhood's bloom, 
And sought an Eastern bower, 
That's how it came she bears the name 
Of little Prairie Flower. 
Now her parents they are fond of me, 
And welcome me with cheer, 
But one more sweet comes out to meet 
Me as I 
come a-near— 
With her pretty little outstretched hands, 
While, with loving words a 
shower, 
never miss her modest kiss, 
Behind the cottage door ; 
I 
love her, yes, I 
must confess, 
This little Prairie Flower. 
She's the fairest, etc. 
Oh! if you could only hear her sing, 
Her soft, sweet, bird- like voice, 
The notes so clear would charm your ear, 
Your heart and soul rejoice; 
Oh! when you hear the village bells ring, 
As they never rang before— 
Remember this—the joy and bliss, 
That then shall be my dower, 
The pleasure's rife when she's my wife, 
My little Prairie Flower. 
She's Lim fairest, etc. 
HOW CAN I LEAVE THEE ? 
How can I 
leave thee ? 
How can I 
say farewell 1 
How can I 
break the spell 
So dear to me 
Thou art a 
pleasing dream, 
Thou art a 
life divine, 
Guiding this heart of mine 
O'er life's dark sea! 
There is a 
blooming flower 
In life's enchanted vale, 
Sighing in every gale: 
" 
Forget rue not!" 
Here only spring appears, 
Chasing the laughing hours, 
Scattering her richest flowers 
Love's hallowed spot! 
Oh! would I 
were a 
bird! 
To cheer affection's bower, 
With thee to pass each hour, 
Swiftly I'd fly. 
Though sorrow o'er my heart 
Swept like some demon- wing, 
Still to thee could I 
cling— 
'Twere joy to,die 
i"

FAIR ELLEN ORE: 
By 
W. 
H. 
DELEHANTY. 
MY 
heart is light by day and night, 
With hope and love and joy in store, 
Since I 
have seen the lovely queen— 
The modest maiden, Ellenore. 
She's good and kind, and so refined, 
She has no fear the wide world o'er, 
Her sweetest smile is free of guile, 
A 
flower of love is Ellenore. 
CHORUS. 
Sweet Ellenore, fair Ellenore, 
Thou bast my heart forever more, 
'Tis full of love pure from above, 
For thee, for the; lair Ellenore 
The joys of spring, the birds that sing ! 
The woodbine twinfng 'round thy door, 
The sweet perfume of flowers in bloom 
Are loves of thee which I 
adore; 
I'll ne'er forget when last we met, 
The kindly tear your eye filled o'er; 
And mina were blind by feelings kind, 
The day we parted, Ellenore. 
Sweet Ellenore, etc. 
I 
hope and pray that come it may, 
The end of sorrow's weary chain: - 
When I 
once more on native shore, 
May tread the dear paths o'er again 
And may it' come aCross the foam, 
The sweet news touching my heart's core, 
That Ellenore waits at the door,. 
To meet me as in days before. 
Sweet -Ellenore, etc 
THERE'S SOMETHING I'M DYING TO SAY. 
Ow, there's something I'm dying to say, 
Though I 
hardly know how to begin; 
But to lose an occasion like this 
Would he foolish as well as a 
sin. 
So now, then, for better or worse, 
I 
must surely proceed on my way; 
But, dear me, oh ! how dreadful it is 
To have something you're dying to say. 
Something I'm dying to say— 
There's something I'm dying to say; 
But, dear me, how dreadful it is 
To have something you're dying to say, 
When you choose a 
nice spot in the woods, 
And your handkerchief spread on the ground, 
And tie fair one invite, with a 
blush, 
To partake of the seat you have found; 
And then, if she smiling consents, 
You most awkwardly stand in the way, 
Then you cough—that's as far as you get 
In the something you're dying to say. 
Something I'm dying to say, etc. 
Or perhaps, then, with courage renewed, 
You will tremblingly sit yourself down, 
She inquiringly looks in your face, 
Then you carefully look all around; 
And now with an effort so great, 
As you think of the chance that you've got, 
Say, under your breath : " Dearest girl, 
1 
think—that—the—weather—is--hot." 
Something I'm dytng tts say, eta.

MY LOVE IS LIKE A BIRD. 
W ritten and composed by W. H. DELEHANTT. 
MY 
love is like a 
bird, 
With plumage bright and fair, 
Her voice is like a 
chord 
Of music in the air; 
She's here and then she's there, 
She comes but will not stay, 
And when I 
think she's near, 
I 
find she's far away. 
CHORUS. 
First she'll please me, 
Then she'll tease me, 
Then she'll say some loving word, 
Singing, smiling—winning, wiling, 
Flitting here and there— 
My love is like a 
bird. 
All in the summer time 
When. flowers are blooming gay, 
And merry birds do chime 
Their sweet notes all the day; 
We wander through the dell, 
Or in the shady grove, 
And when my love I 
tell— 
She only laughs at love. 
First she'll please me, etc. 
My love is like a 
bird, 
For in the winter time 
Her voice is never heard 
About this chilly clime ; 
But to a 
dearer spot 
She flies away to rest, 
Her hoe is in my heart, 
That's where she built her pest. 
plene me, etc. 
PLEASE LET MY BROTHER GO. 
As sung by the FREEMAN SISTERS. 
MY 
brother did not mean to steal, 
His conscience told him ' twas not right, 
But we are very hungry, sir, 
This cold and piercing winter's night; 
No one will give him work to do— 
He begged all day for bread in vain, 
We nearly starved for food to eat, 
Please let my brother go. 
CHORUS. 
Let my brother go with me, 
Please let my brother go, 
For he's all I 
have in this world— 
Please let my brother go. 
'Tis many years ssnce father died, 
Our gentle mother we never knew, 
Our uncle turned us from his door, 
Pray what could we children do 1 
We try so hard to live, kind sir, 
Our life is little else save woe, 
We will do right, indeed we will, 
Please let my brother go. 
Let my brother, etc. 
By day we walk the crowded streets, 
Begging so hard for work and bread, 
And when night comes we lay us down, 
With naught but the blue sky o'er head; 
And then I 
ask our Father kind 
To help the orphans here below; 
Oh, he will bless you, gentle sir, 
If you will let my brother go. 
Let my brother, etc.

THE LILY OF THE VALLEY. 
Written and composed by Wm. H. DELEHANTY. 
W ILL you take a 
little ramble in the country, 
It's only just a 
little way from town, 
To an ivy-covered cottage in the valley, 
Where dwells a 
lovely maiden of renown; 
And she's the sweetest girl by far, 
That ever you did see, 
Among the other girls a 
star, 
She ever seems to be; 
And should you like to see this fiow'r, 
Just take a 
walk with me, 
And from her little garden bower, 
I'm sure she'll smile on thee. 
CHORUS. 
She's the lily of the valley, 
And the girl I 
intend to marry, 
But come and take a 
ramble in the country, 
'Tis where the scent of roses fill the air, 
It's there you'll see the lily of the valley, 
All in her golden beauty, fresh and fair! 
Oh, if you could only see her in the morning, 
It's when she goes for water to the spring, 
And see the lovely smile her face adorning, 
Or hear the pretty sow/ I 
heard her sing; 
You surely never could forget, 
And when in lonely hours— 
You'd think with joy of when you met 
My love among the flowers; 
Then, if you envy me my lot, 
You cannot be to blame; 
For if some other won her heart, 
I 
know I'd feel the same. 
She's the lily, etc. 
Oh, lovely was the day when last I 
met her, 
And charming was the secret told to me, 
'Twas that she'd write me a 
letter, 
And place it in the hollow of a 
tree. 
That I 
should imitate her style 
She meekly did infer, 
While thro' her blush there came a 
smile— 
With—leave one there for her, 
The one you love the best in life— 
Make a 
messenger of me, 
I'll soon have-power to call her wife, 
Then I 
will happy be. 
She's the lily, etc.

MY 
1VI-FlINIORY IS SO BAD. 
FOLKS say I'm growing querulous, a regular 
cross-grained 
patch, 
Because I'm troubled with the gout, and wear a 
wig—a 
scratch ; 
But worse than that, they spread reports, they say they've 
heard from me, 
Which cause a 
deal of mischief, but with truth do not agree 
I'm sure I 
never dreamt of such; it really makes me sad, 
To think—what was I 
saving then 7 
my mem'ry is so bad. 
My mem'ry is so bail, it really makes me sad— 
To think what I 
was saying then ? my mem'ry is so bad. 
Oh! I 
remember, Tuesday, no, ' twas Wednesday, thereabout, 
I 
heard on good authority, the President is coming out— 
At opera and a 
concert too, his gracious Majesty 
Will smile upon his subjects true, as once it used to be ; 
Now perhaps you think I 
made this up, which sounds like news 
most glad, 
I 
heard it—though I ,can't say where, my mem'ry is so bad. 
Oh! dear, it's very sad, it nearly drives me mad 
I 
can't tell where I 
heard it, for my =dry is so bad. 
I 
took a 
cab the other day, and told him where to go, 
'Twas Saratoga or Niagara—but I 
found myself at Troy; 
In vain I 
stormed, he coolly said,—" I'd bade him drive me 
there," 
When in the dense excitement, I 
forgot to pay his fare ; 
He might have asked politely, not in terms as he were mad, 
Then summoned me, I'd costs to pay—my mem'ry is so bad. 
He served me very bad, and no redress I 
had, 
The magistrate said I 
must pay, since my menfry was so 
bad.  
I 
once fell over head and ears in love, but even then; 
My great misfortune haunted me—most wretched of all men ; 
The day was fixed, I 
bOught the ring, when dreadful to relate, 
I 
reached the church, but found I 
came just two days after 
date, 
Of course a 
breach of promise case they brought, and so I 
had 
Five hundred dollars to pay, because my rnem'ry Is so bad, 
It really was too bad, to pay of course I 
had, 
Five hundred dollars, and all because my mem'ry is so bad.

THERE is not a 
lady in the land, 
That I 
envy her lot; 
My Charley is a 
sailor bold, 
A 
coat of blue he's got; 
He is a 
son of Uncle Sam ! 
And for our flag does fight, 
That banner that we all do love, 
Which does defen I 
the right. 
CHORUS. 
When the cry of the battle is heard—he flies quick at the word, 
He cares not, he heeds not, he fears not defeat ; 
He's always first in fight, beneath our banner bright, 
Is Charley, my Charley, my Charley in the Key West Fleet. 
I 
last saw my young hero bold, 
'Twas on a 
Summer's day; 
He stood upon his vessel's deck, 
As she sailed down the bay ; 
He gave me one sweet parting smile, 
He waved his hand and cried : 
" 
I 
got to fight the foeman bold, 
That has our flag defied !" 
When the cry, etc. 
I 
wish him luck from morn till night, 
My gallant boy in blue; 
I 
know unto his country's cause, 
And me! he will be true. 
I 
know beneath the stars and stripes 
He'll fight the battle well ; 
As Farragut and Lawrence did, 
And history will tell. 
When the cry, etc. 
I 
love the soldier bold and brave, 
He well defends our land ; 
But better still I 
love to fwaise 
Our nation's sailor band ! 
I 
know to me he'll soon return, 
In joyful glee we'll meet ; 
I 
long to clasp my Charley's hand, 
Safe from the Key West Fleet. 
When the cry, etc.

I KNOW A MAID. 
By Wm. H. DELEHANTY. 
I 
KNOW a 
maid who loves me, 
And holds my heart in keeping, 
For every day she proves me, 
Her love to me is leaping, 
Like dews of summer weeping, 
In tears the budrose steeping. 
CHORITS. 
Oh! she's the darling of my heart, 
The sunshine of my eye, 
The love I 
feel can never part, 
Nor can it change or die. 
If you should chance to meet her, 
With grace and beauty charming, 
I'm sure you'd fondly greet her 
With admiration warming, 
With love your heart alarming, 
And wishes free of harming. 
Oh! she's the darling, etc. 
Hadist thou but heard her talking, 
And the attention given, 
Or by her side been walking, 
That pleasant summer even, 
The air was flower-breath laden, 
And earth seemed part of heaven. 
Oh ! she's the darling, etc.

THAT'S W H ERE I KNOW 
YOU ARE RIGHT. 
As sung by JENNIE HUGHES. 
GOOD people, I 
ask you to listen, 
And heed what I 
say in my song. 
Common sense is the best kind of tutor, 
It teaches us right from wrong. 
There's two ends you must know to a 
string, boys, 
So be careful when you fly your kite, 
Have a 
care that she don't go too high in the air, 
That's where I 
know you are right; 
Fair play is a 
jewel we must dearly prize, 
So be impartial, my boys in a 
fight; 
You must always believe what you see with you're eyes, 
And that's where I 
know you are right. 
Whenever you go on a 
pic-nic, 
Enjoy yourselves, have lots of sport, 
Take your girl, your father and mother, 
Good lager beer, sherry and port, 
Don't stand still and look like a 
Quaker; 
Be merry, cheerful and bright, 
And when there's a 
dance, bounce in for a 
chance, 
And that's where I 
know you are right. 
It's pleasure, my boys, that keeps us alive, 
So go in for fun day and night; 
Lauah and grow fat, don't look like a 
cat, 
And that's where I 
know you are right. 
If you're wise enough to save money 
And send all your children to school, 
The world will call you a 
miser ; 
Just kick 'gainst the world like a 
mule, 
For when you are aged and decrepit, 
From hard work you take a 
respite, 
Then you will say, ' I'm dry on a 
wet day," 
And that's where I 
know you are right. 
For money you know, makes the mare go,— 
Don't be stingy, greedy or tight, 
You can be a 
good fellow without being a 
fool, 
And that's where I 
know you are right. 
Should you marry a 
bad-tempered woman, 
One who could give you a 
look 
That would send you out in the kitchen, 
To wash, to scrub, and to cook ; 
Go tie up your things in a 
bundle, 
Escape from your room in the night, 
As a 
matter of course, take a 
sudden divorce, 
And that's where I 
know you are right. 
To the ladies, God bless you, I 
say the same thing, 
If your're brute of a 
husband (lets tight, 
Lock him up in a 
room, beat Min With a 
broom, 
And that's where I 
know you are right.

MAUD DE MOORE . 
W ritten by 1711. ii. DELF.HANTY. 
My heart is light by day or night, 
With hope and love and joy in store, 
Since I 
have seen the lovely queen— 
The modest maiden Maud De Moore. 
And when you see her you'll agree— 
She has no peer the wide world o'er, 
Her sweetest smile knows naught of guile, 
" 
A 
flower of love" is Maud De Moore. 
CHORUS. 
Thou hast my heart where'er thou art, 
Sweet Maud I 
cannot offer more, 
'Tis full of love pure from above, 
Deal kindly with it Maud De Moore. 
The joys of spring the birds that sing, 
The ivy twining round thy door, 
The sweet perfume of flowers in bloom, 
Are loves of the which I 
adore; 
When last we met can I 
forget, 
The kindly tear your eye filled o'er, 
And I 
was blind with feelings kind— 
But sad to part with Maud de Moore. 
Thou hast my heart, et. 
I 
hope and pray, that come it may, 
The end of sorrow's weary chain, 
When I 
once more my native shore, 
May tread its dear paths o'er again, 
And may it come across the foam, 
The joy that reaches my heart's core, 
To know you'll meet me at the gate, 
As loving as in days of yore. 
Thou bast my heart, etc.

BESSY DOON, THE SWhETEST OF THEM ALL. 
Written and Composed by W
. 
H. 
DELEHANTY. 
On I 
know a 
little maiden, 
By the name of" Bessy Doon," 
And by invitation I 
am going to call; 
And my heart with love is laden, 
Since we met this afternoon, 
When she blushed and said she loved me best of all 
And she looked just as charming— 
As the flowers in May, 
Or a 
peach ripe, ready for to fall. 
Oh ! I 
couldn't see the harm in— 
Giving her my heart to-day, 
For I 
really think she's the sweetest of them all. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! tell me why—you wink your eye, 
You roguish little butterfly, 
Or do you know on whom I'm going to call. 
While merrily on every tree 
The little birdies sing to me— 
Bessie is the sweetest girl of all. 
Now I 
was one of them who thought 
That love was all a 
myth, 
And I 
never gave it any heed at all! 
Cupid's quiver struck my heart and 
Wrote a 
verse beginning with— 
Oh! Bessy is the sweetest girl of all; 
Then I 
felt just as happy 
As a 
big sunflower, 
Nodding in the breezes high and tall. 
Then I 
saw entrancing beauty, 
And I 
felt its tender power, 
For I 
love Miss Bessy Doon•the best of all. 
Oh! tell me why, etc. 
Ah ! I 
can no longer linger, 
For my time is growing short, 
But I 
hope to meet you all some day again; 
And if Bessie is a 
singer, 
Just to have a 
little sport 
I'll bring her here to sing a 
sad refrain. 
She will sing a 
sad farewell 
To the nobby little chaps— 
That dance in attendance to her call; 
Say adieu to every belle, 
For I'll marry soon perhaps, 
Miss Bessy Doen, the sweetest of them all. 
Oh ! tell me why, etc.

HE'S WORSE THAN MY BIG BROTHER. 
As Sung by JENNIE HUGHES.. 
I 
AM tormented night and day, 
The fact I,cannot smother, 
By my intended husband, 
And also my big brother; 
They're always teazing me, they are, 
I've not one moment's quiet, 
From morn till night, ' tis their delight 
In the house to cause a 
riot. 
SPOKEN.—I 
used to think my brother a 
harum scarum, but I 
assure you my sweetheart, Lionel, is a 
perfect limb, always 
playing tricks upon us, but notwithstanding his faults— 
CHORUS. 
Oh! he loves me and I 
love him, 
We both love one another, 
lie's such a 
dreadful teaze, he is, 
He's worse than my big brother. 
My'brother's led my sweetheart 
To bitter beer and smoking ; 
They don't indulge too much, 
But then ' tis really so provoking. 
In the drawing-room or sitting-room, 
The fumes are wafted freely, 
The smoke in fumes does arise 
And always chokes me nearly. 
SPOKEN — No matter how I 
lecture them about smoking in 
the drawing- room, they won't desist. 
Then, Lionel says to me, 
" 
Now my darling wife, that is to be, you wouldn't debar your 
husband, that will be, of one of his greatest enjoyments, would 
you 1 Well, there, I'll put out the pipe to oblige you ?" 
Di-
rectly I 
leave the room, there they are puffing clouds out again, 
but 
Oh ! he loves me, etc. 
Now my brother climbs the house-top, 
And down the chimney cries, 
When we're talking of the future, 
And arranging nuptial ties. 
Then Lionel my intended, 
Makes all sorts of false alarms, 
By saying the wardrobe is on fire, 
And swoons in the servant's arms. 
SPOKEN.—W ell, I'll let him have his own way while he's sin-
gla. but I 
believe he'll be just as bad when married. 
Well, I 
.loa't care if he is, for

PAT AND KITTY. 
A COMIC DUET. 
PAT.—Now Kitty dear, my story hear, 
A 
word or two I'll say, 
You know an honest Irishman 
Will always have his way. 
KITTY.—W ill always try, that's what you mean, 
I 
know you, do you see. 
Now, Mr. Pat, do you moind that, 
You cannot blarney me. 
PAT.—Oh hould yer jaw, and don't you spake, 
About blarneying to me. 
KITTY.—You're a 
fine lad, with lots of gab, 
But you can't play that on me. 
PAT.—Oh, Kitty, if you don't have me, 
My poor ould heart will break; 
KITTY.—Oh sure if you're as bad as that 
Go home, and something take. 
PAT.—I
'll take a 
dose of poison cold, 
All for the sake of you. 
KITTY.—Oh 
I 
shan't cry a 
bit, you fool, 
'Tis the best thing you can do. 
PAT.—Oh, Kitty dear, have you no heart ? 
KITTY.—Get out, you foolish elf. 
PAT.—If 
you've a 
heart, give it to me, 
KITTY.—I 
want it all myself. 
PAT AND KITTY.—Continued. 
PAT.—Your eyes they are like the diamonds, 
KITTY.—They're not for they are blue. 
PAT.—Your cheeks they are two roses, 
KITTY.—Not to be pluck'd by you. 
PAT.—You're lips are like the cherries, 
KITTY.—But not for you to taste. 
PAT.—You're a 
pretty little angel, 
KITTY.—And you're an ugly baste. 
PAT.—Oh murther did you hear her then 
KITTY.— Go away, you clumsy lout. 
PAT.—Now, Kitty darling, only say, 
KITTY.—Does your mother know you're out ? 
PAT.—I've got a 
horse—I've got a 
cart. 
KITTY. — Oft of that you've bluster'd. 
PAT.—I've got a 
pig—I've got a 
cow, 
One that gives milk, and custard. 
I've got a 
cabin, nicely built 
To keep you from all harm, 
And a 
big mattress, stuff'd wid straw, 
To keep you nice and warm. 
KITTY.—Oh, Pat, ye have such winning ways, 
I 
must grant your request. 
PAT.—Let us haste, unto the praste, and— 
KITTY.—( Spoken) Well, go on Pat, don't be fooling; 
PAT.—(Sings) Well, time will show the rest.

Written by W m. IL DELEIIANTY. 
I'M happy as the birds in Spring- time, 
That warble in the air, 
While they hop about from limb to limb, 
For the troubles of the world they little care. 
So that's the very way I'm feeling, 
The reason I 
will tell. 
I'm in love as you can plainly see, 
With. a 
captivating roguish little belle. 
CHORUS. 
We first met in the Summer, 
Down by a 
running stream, 
And upon my sacred honor, 
It seems to lie a 
dream. 
But I 
love her as you may suppose, 
She's one of sweet sixteen, 
And as pretty as the red, red rose, 
Is the roguish little beauty, Etnaline. 
Now of all the pretty girls I 
know of, 
There's none so sweet and fair. 
For her eyes are like a 
bright sun-beam, 
And a 
light brown is the color of her hair. 
I 
received a 
billet-doux this morning 
From one in love, I 
ween, 
Which has made me happy all day long, 
'Twas from the little beauty, Emaline! 
We first met, etc. 
In her note she said she wished to see me, 
If the weather it be fine, 
So, this night I'm going to meet my love, 
As I 
live in hopes to make this beauty mine. 
She's the darling of my heart, and dearer 
Than all on earth beside, 
And my happiness will be complete, 
When I 
take this little beauty for my bride. 
We first met, etc.

HOW CHTIERING A GLANCE AT OLD ERLN 
WOULD BE. 
How cheering a 
glance at old Erin would be, 
My darling old country the gem of the sea, 
Where long, long ago I 
was rear'd mid the bogs, 
And had a 
neat cabin built snugly of logs, 
The dear little shamrock it grew all around, 
And spread its green leaves on my own native ground, 
The flax and the rye in abundance was there, 
Sweet Ireland, my jewel, you are ever so fair, 
Old country, I 
wish I 
could see thee once more, 
I 
wish I 
could rap at a 
fond cabin door, 
Where Katie, the girl that I 
once lov'd so well, 
Is living with Elie the dame of the dell. 
Oh I 
could -I 
but take from her sweet ruby lips, 
The honey thaVs richer than any bee sips, 
It would drive from my heart all anguish and pain, 
That now makes it weary to see her again. 
Oh, Katie, my dewdrop, come whisper to me, 
And send me a 
greeting far over the sea, 
For nothing to me is more sweet than you, 
And heaven is painted fair in your eyes blue; 
'Tis many long years since we walked side by sidp, 
And long is the time since I 
call'd you my pride, 
But Katie, my darling, my own pretty sweet, 
Remember your heart must be mine till NV e 
meet. 
Written and Composed by BARRY CARTER for TUE FIELDINGS.
