can't is because of drainage. If the city only knrw whcrc its } st ¶ntcr-
ests lay-- they've put in several millions of dolJotrs aIrcod
 
on art  m
a ci -
drnina e system and I should say that the greater half of the necessary
 
work is finished. Aily no,  it wouldn't be necessary to drain this whole
 
area-- this is not a flooded sector; why, I
've been here since 1200 arH
 
there's never been a flood that has damaged any property out here.

 ne
 
of
 
he finest in the whole country-- best location, r
oost r
oilerttre in runways;
 
they filled it up with fifteen feet of gravel fill, raised up that whole
 
ir Fort area fifteen feet. Vhy,  in a few more years Eastwick is going to
 
be one of the most important areas in the whole city-- are you aware of
 
the fact that the new super-highway is planned to come right throuch  th e
 
heart of Eastwick? It's a Federal proposition; however, I think th€ s
our
 
fran narrlsburg to Philadelphia is to be financed jointly het o e e n  the
 
state of iennsylvania and the Federal Government. If the
 
J
'  bile-
deiphia could see its  way clear to finance the sewer, we would find a
 
housing boom in Eastwick very shortly. '
i
.here is no location for w orki r
1 T
 
class people's homes better than 1astwick. We have whole tracts of aso-
lutely vacant land out here;  its only a few minutes from here to the
 
vy lard and the old transportation facilities that they bu i

waste water went into cess-pools the area would he flooded over.
 
ou see,  the trouble with the city of Philadelphia is it doesn'L
 
act in accordance with its own best interests. All the taxable pr0perL2c 
in khiladelphia--  the nice homes five to  seventy-five hundred dollar
 
have moved outside of the city limits. Now Eastwick is within the cit
 
limits and ihiladelphia is in need of new tax resources,  if the under-

find itself in a considerably better financial condit Yn.
