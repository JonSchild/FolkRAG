We

Happy, happy Hottentots, 
And from Africa we came, 
That's where we got our name , 
We used to gather Bucuh leaves, 
Buchu, Buchu, gather Buchu leaves, 
And when Massa Hembold came 
He paid us for the same. 
CHORLis. 
This is what we used to do, 
Picking up the Buchu, 
We are happy Hottentots, 
Happy, happy Hottentots, 
And from Africa we came, 
'That's where we got our name. 
Every night when work is done, 
Day time, night time, always full of fun, 
In our cozy little cots, 
Us happy Tottentots, 
Sing and dance most all the day, 
Singing, dancing, pass the time away, 
All our troubles come and go, 
We 
send them all below.

Beckey G-ildersleeve. 
Written by CHAS. SANDERS. Sung by GRAHAII & JONES with great success. 
Sweet was the girl I 
met last Sunday 
While walking through the park to take the evening air, 
She smiled when I 
passed her, 
My heart went with her, 
I 
knew that I 
had won 
This little Deitcher girl so fair, ( Break.) 
Oh, she sent me a note ( Break.) 
On which was wrote— 
Her name was Beekey Gildersleeve, 
Her fader he was rich, 
Her mutter keeps a 
bier serloon 
Behind McCoomb's Ditch, 
I 
am going to meet this German girl 
Next Sunday afternoon, 
I'll treat her to a 
dozen bier's, 
And catch her very soon. 
I'll put on me Sunday clothes 
And won't I 
look gallus, 
With my swallow- tail coat, 
Double-breasted in the back, 
I'll pay five cents on the steam locomotive 
And to her house I'll ride on the railroad track ; 
I 
expect there will be a band, ( Break.) 
At the depot when I 
land. 
To escort me to my Beckey's house, 
Und then her folks will see, 
Or else a 
half a 
dozen clubs 
Be waiting there for me. 
And if I 
don't get her consent, 
I 
know I 
turn a 
loon, 
And cut my throat with a 
bar of soap; 
That will end me very soon. 
Sheeny Mose. 
Ant.—" Johnny Morgan." 
Written by James Richmond for Hen Graham. 
His name was Moses Rosenthal, 
They called him Sheeny Mose, 
He lived around in Bayard Street, 
His mother peddled old clothes, 
ills father sold suspenders, 
Moses eat Motzers every day, 
He was a 
sheeny speeler, 
And the girls to him would say— 
CHORUS. 
Sheeny Moses, Sheeny Moses, 
Always around Walhalla Hall, 
Sheeny Moses, Sheeny Moses, 
Tie is got a 
terrible gall, 
his nose is like a 
lance, 
And he always wears tight pants, 
They call him a 
giraff and the girls all laugh, 
And say here comes Sheeny Mose. 
He looks like the handle of a 
broom, 
Or a 
broken telegraph pole, 
He goes down to Cohen's with Rachael Isaacs 
To waltz for a 
ton of coal. 
He never worked, nor never will, 
For Assembly he's going to run, 
lie tells the girls in Ludlow street 
That he is John Jacob Astor's son.

Since Solomon Joined the Gang. 
Written by JAS. RICHMOND; sung with great success by HENRY GRAHAM. 
AIR: " 
Base Ball." 
My name is Patrick Rubenstein, 
I 
am a 
clothing store by trade ; 
I've got a 
wife and fourteen children, too, 
And I 
belong to the Sheeney's Brigade. 
But my son Solomon is gone on Buffalo Bill, 
It was only last night, that he tapped my till; 
It will break my gall, I 
know it will, 
Since my son Solomon joined the gang. 
There are seventeen loafers in the gang, 
My son, young Isaacs, and Shorty McGuire; 
It was only last night they robbed a 
bank, 
And set my store on fire. 
They stole a 
ton of coal from Mrs. O'Brien, 
And a 
train of cars from the Elevated Line, 
And set fire to a 
pawnbroker's sign, 
Since my son Solomon joined the gang. 
At Gilmore's Garden, at the walking match, 
The gang stole about sixty thousand dollar, 
Some watches, jewelry, and gold rings, 
And they never got the collar. 
They gave me fifty cents not to give it away, 
Then stole a 
horse and wagon on St. Patrick's day, 
Oh, I'll move to Ireland on the first of-May, 
Since my son Solomon joiaed the gang. 
They went out West to fight Sitting Bull, 
They walked to Deadwood in twenty laps ; 
They had pistols, knives, and powder and shot, 
And a 
box of t 
wo-cent caps. 
The Indians mad,
_1 the gang feel sick, 
The first train they could catch they come hacli 
double quick; 
My wife with heartbreak and trouble for twr, ytarA b.at 
been sick, 
Since my son Solomon joined the gang.

Only the Way on the Stage. 
Composed by FRED. J. M ACKLEY and sung by H ENRY GRAHAM. 
If you will listen to me, some facts I 
will mention, 
Concerning the past and the present strange age, 
And in them, my friends, to you I'll relate 
Some things I 
saw one night and played on the stage: 
I 
came to this city with one or two friends, 
And went for a 
stroll, they seemed quite amazed, 
When we read on the bills of the Bowery Theatre, 
And found a 
new drama was played on the stage. 
The first scene I 
saw was a 
street in New York, 
There a 
poor woman begging, she quite old in age, 
Those sad means she tried to keep her from starving, 
A 
very sad lesson of life's book a 
page; 
But a 
policeman passed by, his face seemed all smiles, 
Placed his hand in his pocket and drew forth his wages, 
And he gave part to help this poor wretched woman, 
But ' twas only the way it was played on the stage. 
The scene it then changed from a 
street to a 
court room, 
There a:prisoner on trial for a 
crime very sad, 
He'd murdered a 
man, by the people respected, 
And the court room was crowded with people so glad 
To see that man punished for the crime he committed. 
The jury looked stern, and the judge in a 
rage, 
And they hung that.rich man for the murder of Fisk, 
But it was only the way it was played on the stage. 
In the next scene I 
saw a 
clergyman _ rom Brooklyn, 
Who was dancing a 
hornpipe, and seemed quite the rage, 
Another one from Jersey was playing the violin, 
The audience in front with wonderment gazed; 
For just at that minute a 
party named Tilton 
Then gave a 
fine sermon on the morals of the age, 
And I 
thought that they practiced each sermon they preached, 
But it was only the way it wr.s playe<1 on the stage.

Written and composed by DAN SULLY. 
As sung with immense success by EMMA DEZODA. 
'Twas a 
pleasant morn in Spring, 
When the birds began to sing, 
And the flowers with their perfume filled the air; 
Carelessly I 
went along, 
Singing snatches from a 
song, 
When I 
espied a 
maid with a 
head of golden hair. 
She bestowed on me a 
smile, 
Fascinating all the while, 
And in her hand she held a 
little flower; 
Which she pinned upon my breast, 
And you can guess the rest, 
And I 
called her then my little golden shower. 
CHORUS. 
She's the angel of my dreams, (Sym.) 
Her eye so loving beams, ( SYm.) 
Oh. my! she looked so gay, 
Like a 
little sunny ray, 
And I 
called her then my little golden shower. 
She said I 
will be thine, 
Then she put her hand in mine, 
And she softly laid her head upon my breast; 
I 
was in a 
whirl of bliss, 
When I 
asked her for a 
kiss, 
And her rosy lips to mine she shyly pressed. 
I 
clasped her in my arms, 
And I 
gloried in her charms, 
Which put me in a 
heaven of delight; 
And now I 
am her beau, 
And in the little church below, 
We'll married be just a 
week to-night.

Good Shepherd, Where Art Thou? 
Written by EMILE AMES, and sung by the AMES' in their sketch, " The 
Return from the War." 
John was a 
writing, 
Writing for de show, 
De Lord came down an' spoke to John, 
Saying " John, don't write no 
Noah was a 
carpenter, 
'Case he built the ark, 
And Jonah was a 
fisherman 
'Case he swallowed de shark. 
CHORUS. 
Good shepherd, whar art thou ? 
Good shepherd, whar art thou ? 
Oh, oh, good shepherd, 
De sheep am gwine astray. 
De Lord made de alligator, 
Den he made de whale, 
Den he made de bull-dog, 
Wid a 
ring around his tail. 
I 
had a 
little rooster, 
lie wouldn't crow for day, 
I 
prayed for a 
weasel to come along 
An' tote dat rooster away.

GOLDEN HAIR. 
SONG AND DANCE. 
Sung by T. M. EIENGLER. 
As I 
strolled out one evening, 
The sun had just gone down 
While pleasantly meandering 
little way from town, 
I 
there beheld a, damsel 
With eyes the brightest blue 
Beneath her dark eyelashes, 
Like violets dipped in dew. 
CHORUS. 
She smiled so sweet upon me, (symph.) 
That moment she had won me, 
'Twas love the first I 
knew. 
There. some sweet charm entrancing, 
With this dear girl so fair, 
A 
rosy, soft expression, 
With a 
mass of Golden Hair. 
Now, I 
followed on behind her, 
I 
think she knew it well, 
And as a 
sweet reminder, 
Her handkerchief it fell ; 
I 
raised the scented linen 
From off the grassy ground; 
Her name, in letters crimson, 
On one corner then I 
found. 
At length I 
did approach her, 
And ventured in the task, , 
r.y asking her permission 
To join her lonely walk; 
She blushing, frowning. smiling, 
Said, oh! I 
think you rude, 
But those blue eyes, beguiling, 
Seemed to say, I 
wish you would.

And pull my har out by de core;

She has me taken, clothed and fed, 
Den sends me up to make de bed,

Here we are, two Lackawanna spooners, 
While we're here cast your eyes upon us ; 
We unload coal boats from Harlem to Gowanus, 
We're the two selected spooners of the gang. 
When we go home, our families we embrace, 
We ate our meals with elegance and grace, 
We'll lay aside the shovel, for we long to have a 
race, 
We're the two selected spooners of the gang.

We're the two selected spooners of the gang. 
We all live down in John McSauley's 
Last election day we cast our votes for Tilden ; 
And they all do say we're the solidest in the building, 
The two selected spooners of the gang. 
We all get shaved in the one barber shop, 
By the one man, his razor, and his strop ; 
We all get the lather from the one brush and cup, 
The two selected spooners of the gang.

Thou'st gone far away from me darling, 
I've lain thee in yon silent tomb; 
Yet mem' ry recalls thy sweet presence, 
To cheer me where'er I 
may roam. 
I 
think of the day we were parted, 
The heart-bi•oken friends that stood by, 
Death came and it severed that tie, love, 
Thy spirit did mount upon high. 
CHORUS. 
Thou'st gone far away from me darling, 
I've lain thee in you silent tomb; 
Yet mem'ry recalls thy sweet presence, 
To cheer me where'er I 
may roam. 
I've thought of our home in the West love, 
Of friends and kindred so dear; 
Alas! death has entered that home, love, 
And robbed it of all that can cheer. 
I 
think of thee ever, my loved one, 
How hard it was from thee to part; 
And while I 
have life and have hope, love, 
I'll cherish thee to my heart. 
I'll come to thee soon, my dear darling, 
And never again from thee part; 
The sun then will shine with that brightness, 
And pleasure return to my heart 
Then life shall be sweet as before, love, 
And gladness re-echo with joy; 
To meet thee above in that realm love, 
Where death ne'er again can destroy.

Down among the daisies, by a 
little stream, 
Where the silver waters softly glide, 
Making sweetest music in the mellow gleam 
Of the sunbeams dancing on the tide. 
There I 
meet my darling every summer day, 
While the leaflets nodding up above 
Are the only ones that list to what we say, 
As we whisper o'er our tale of love. 
CHORUS. 
Down among the daisies, by a 
little stream, 
Where the waters ripple soft and low, 
Sitting with my darling, in a 
happy dream, 
Heedless of the hours that come and go. 
Down among the daisies, some one says to kit( 
Oh, I 
love you better than my life ; 
Some one softly answers—in the days te. be 
May I 
hope to win you for my wife? 
Many solemn vows are whispered there and tilt!, 
Many words are spoken soft and lfiw; 
'Tis the same old story whispered o'er again, 
New to us as in the long ago. 
Down among the daisies, &.( 
Down among the daisies we will ever dwell, 
In a 
little cottage by the stream ; 
Nought shall ever come to break the happy spell, 
Break the golden glimmer of our dream. 
Joys may come and go, like flowers that droop and die, 
But as long as life shall brightly gleam, 
We will cling together, darling, you- and I, 
Down among the daisies by the stream. 
Down among the daisies, &c.

And the best place that I've seen.

Cats in Our Back Yard. 
Written by JAMES RICHMOND for PAT ROONEY. 
Copyrighted by A. J. FISHER, 1879. 
I 
live in a 
brown stone tenement, 
With green shutters painted white ; 
There's a 
family of cats lives in the rear. 
They play " Pinafore" every night. 
They sing something about Maria, 
And the times are very hard; 
Oh, they'll chew tobacco and spit in your eye, 
The cats in our back yard. 
CHORUS. 
Tral a 
le, tral a 
la, 
For the cats in our back yard. 
They have walking matches on the fence, 
Have picnics in the cellar; 
I 
threw seventy bricks at a 
Thomas, 
You ought to hear them beller. 
They sing alto, base, and tenor, 
Oh, they ought to be feathered and tarred ! 
Oh, they are worse than Haverley's Minstrels, 
Yes, the cats in our back yard.

I 
Married Biddy McCarthy. 
Composed by Ned Talbot for J. E. Murphy, of Murphy & Mack. 
I 
went down to Goerck street 
To a 
nice little surprise party, 
And the charmer that I 
met there was 
The darling, Biddy McCarthy. 
Now Biddy was the finest girl, 
And the amusement of the party, 
Says I, I'm surely dead in love 
With the darling, Biddy McCarthy. 
CHORUS. 
With me tra-la-lee, now don't you see, 
I'm gone on Biddy McCarthy. 
(Repeat.) 
We danced the polka " mazourka," 
Likewise the dizzy lanciers, 
And as we moved around the floor 
We were two darling dancers. 
Says Biddy, sure I 
feel afraid 
That I'll have to shake the party, 
I 
says wait awhile until I 
smile, 
And I'll go home with you Biddy McCarthy. 
(Chorus.' 
As I 
went home to Biddy's house 
A 
laughing, talking, chatting, 
I 
met her father at the door 
All out of breath a 
panting. 
Says he, now Biddy where did you get this, 
Did you get him at the party, 
Oh, yes, you honor was the reply 
From darling Biddy McCarthy. 
I 
am happy now, I 
have a 
cow, 
Likewise a 
pig and a 
daughter, 
I 
live in a 
cot in a 
shady spot 
Away across the water. 
My mother-in-law she calls on me, 
She is a 
roaring tartar, 
Her husband as well is like a 
bull, 
But I 
love my Biddy McCarthy.

M URPHY, of MURPHY & Macx, as the hit of the season 
in the laughable sketch, entitled 
The Secret." 
There is a 
girl of famous note 
Among the upper nine, 
Considerably comilfo, 
Or something in that line; 
When but a 
child she answered to 
The sudden name of " Nan," 
But now her high- tuned monnygram 
Is Bidalia Jane McCann. 
CHORUS. 
Bidalia Jane McCann, the elegant Miss McCann, 
There's none so sweet as her, no girl so neat as her, 
Peggy or Julia, Johanna or Kate, like Bidalia Jane McCann, 
The elegant Miss McCann, I'm sure there's not wan, 
That can bate the bon-ton of Bidalia Jane McCann. 
Her education's wonderful, 
She spells and writes by ear, 
She plays tbe " Maiden's Prairie," 
And sings " Beloved Ear." 
She says, " I 
feel so fatigayed 
I 
don't know what to do," 
Says I, " Bidale, some grub and ale, 
Might help your fatigu." 
(Chorus.) 
She gives a " German" every week, 
And " Irish" too as well, 
• 
She says a 
cork would shade my face, 
So I 
could tend the bell; 
She sings duets all by herself, 
She talks French like a 
man, 
She's very aurevoir indeed,

Last Wednesday I 
attended 
A. raffle for a 
stove, 
In aid of the wife and family 
Of Timothy J. Cosgrove. 
Bellys, Hogans, and O'Briens, 
All came in a 
drove, 
To take the dice and shake them nice, 
And try and win the stove. 
CHORUS. 
Forward four, allaman left, while the music it did play, 
'Twas grand delight to see the sight of those Irishmen so 
gay, 
I 
never laughed so hearty in the course of all my life 
Looking at Plug McCarty, pivotin' with his wife. 
At nine o'clock precisely 
The raffling it begun, 
Tom Kelly he jumped ten foot high 
When sixty-four was flung; 
O'Brien yelled out murder, 
With a 
brick his eye was closed 
On that night I 
had to fight, 
While raffling for the stove. 
At six o'clock in the morning 
The raffling it was o'er, 
Tom Kelly he got staving drunk 
And stole away the door; 
Clancy with a 
bottle, 
Sure he all the windows broke; 
Cosgrove grabbed him by the neck, 
And boys, I 
thought he'd choke. 
STELLA LEE. 
Song and dance performed by the French Twin Sisters, with MoKBB

By D. C. Larne. 
I 
KNEW' a 
pretty quadroon, her name was Stella Lee, 
Of all the girls in the land, she was the girl for me, 
Her hair was like the raven, her lips were like the rose, 
Of many thousand beauties, she was the ono to choose, 
CHORUS. 
We met close by a 
streamlet, we wandered through a 
grove, 
Her hair was like the raven, her lips were like the rose, 
Of many thousand beauties, she was the one to chose. 
Oh! Stella how I 
love you, no mortal tongue can tell, 
Your eyes like brightest diamonds, worth million pounds to sell, 
Your form is like the graces, to endorse bewildered man, 
It is honor for to love you, I'll win you if I 
can. 
Oh! Stella, ,ke. 
The world would be a 
torture, without you, dearest love, 
But should you ere forget me, we're sure to meet above, 
My love, my care, my Stella, my own dear Stella Lee, 
Forget, forsake all others, and give your heart to me. 
Oh! Stella, las. 
WE ARE THE MEN FOR THE PLACE. 
Written and sung by HARRY and JOHN TCFRNELL. 
No doubt you have heard of the Delanies, 
The men who were tall, lank, and lean; 
They were the smartest men ever left Wexford town, 
1Vnd the biggest liars that ever were seen; 
They came to America on a 
horse's back, 
And on the ocean with a 
ship ran a 
race. 
SPOKEN.—And if you want two men that can walk one hun-
dred miles in the short space of twenty-four hours, we are the 
men can do it. 
We can sing, dance and outwhistle any other 
men from the same county in Ireland; and don't forget that if 
you want governors or constables, or two men that can vote 
three times in every ward on election day, send for us. 
We 
can clean out a first-class lunch table in ten minutes. I 
tell 
you we are the bone and sinew of the Democratic party, and 
we can pull more planks from under the Democratic party than 
any other two men from Maine to the Pacific slope, and if you 
intend opening a 
saloon, send for us; if you intend opening a 
a 
jail, you can bet we are the men for the place. 
We are the men for the place, 
We are the men for the place; 
With a 
shovel or pick, 
Or two rale Irish Micks, 
We are the men for the place. 
When we came to America, long ago, 
And' stepped on your great Union land, 
It was us that started the first hand organ, 
And opened the first peanut stand; 
We were the originals of the ten cent balloon— 
Tom Collins put a 
stamp on your face. 
SPOKEN.—And if you want a 
couple of actors to play in Jack 
Sheppard, we are the men for the place. 
We are the men, etc. 
 " 
We're Going Home. 
Written and sung with marked success by the " Irish Emperors," FAvol 
and SHIELDS. 
We came from dear old Ireland, 
Where the apple praties grow, 
Way over across the ocean, 
In the County of Sligo. 
We left our wives, God bless them, 
Which made our hearts feel sore, 
But now we're tired roaming around, 
So we're going home once more. 
CHORUS. 
We're going home, 
We're going home, 
For now we're tired roaming around, 
So we're going home again. 
[Repeat Choru, 
Oh, take us back to Ireland, 
Where we were bred and born, 
Way out among the shamrocks, 
So early in the morn. 
We think we see the dear ones 
Coming down the lane; 
When we get back to Erin's Isle, 
We'll never roam again. 
We're going home, &c. 
When Muldoon is President. 
Written by JAS. RICHMOND for PAT ROONEY. 
You've heard of McCormick, the politician, 
But I 
am the man that's wide awake; 
I 
can speak as long as O'Leary can walk, 
And for grammar I 
take the cake, 
I 
was seventeen years a 
Congressman, 
And in the Treasury I 
made a 
big dent; 
I'll have no trade dollars, but all iron money, 
When Muldoon is your President. 
CHORUS. 
I'll give every bootblack a 
brown stone front, 
And the laboring man free rent; 
I'll make politicians walk on their hands to save thei r 
shoes 
When Muldoon is your President. 
I'll have iron railings around New York, 
I'll build a 
railroad across the sea ; 
I'll move Central Park to Washington, 
You can ride to California free. 
I'll tear down all the Elevated roads; 
No more Governors will be my intent; 
I'll have steamboats running by telegraph 
When Muldoon is your President. 
Written by SA1,1 DEVERE, and sung with great success by DAN Com.vER. 
Old Dan Collyer had a 
bull dog, 
He 
was bred of the good old stock; 
For twenty-seven hours a 
battle he fought— 
I'm telling you the truth by the clock. 
His tail was a 
neat little bit of a 
stump, 
Bow-legged, with two crooked eyes; 
One look of his little pug nose was enough, 
He was the devil himself in disguise. 
He 
had all the neighbors crazy, so he did, 
'With his treacherous, villainous tricks ; 
They tried for to kill him with pistols and guns, 
And they flung at him thousands of bricks. 
A 
murdering villain he was, to be sure, 
His equal there never was found, 
For he took Mr. Kelly's pig by the ear, 
And he dragged him all over the ground. 
He tore all the tails off my Sunday coat, 
Eat the bustle off Mary Ann Finn, 
And he run betwixt young Kitty Mulligan's legs, 
Now wasn't that truly a 
sin ? 
He caught up the little Dutch shoemaker's dog, 
And he shook him around like a 
rat; 
He murdered McMulligan's beautiful goat, 
And he eat up Mrs. Hennessy's cat.

Hannah! Hannah! Won't You Be My Bride? 
Written and composed by W. H. DELEI1ANTY. 
BOY. — D011't you see my- 
little love, 
Isn't she a 
turtledove? 
Smiling, beguiling, happy all the day ; 
You can see the sunny South 
In her great big codfish mouth; 
Hannah, Hannah, don't you run away. 
GIRL—No, indeed, koody John, 
1 
will stick when all are gone; 
You can bet your life upon 
Every word I 
say. 
BOY. — Hannah makes me feel so queer, 
I 
could dance upon my ear, 
When I 
know she's standing by by side; 
Come and kiss me ere I 
die, 
Hit me with a 
custard pie, 
Hannah, Hannah, won't you be my bride ? 
Cnonus.—Duel. 
Take me where the sunbeams linger, 
Near the Mississippi tide; 
Place the ring upon my finger. 
Hannah, Hannah, then will be your bride. 
BOY.- 011, give me wings and let me fly, 
Let me go up in the sky. 
Hannah, oh, Hannah, you stole my heart away; 
Oh, come and take me out of pain. 
Give rue back my heart again, 
Hannah, oh, Hannah, hear me what I 
say. 
GIRL.—I 
would, dear John, that's if I 
could, 
Because I 
know I 
really should; 
A man with a 
heart's no good, 
Now this is understood. 
BOY.— Oh, keep it, Hannah, all your life, 
Say you'll be my darling wife, 
Then I'll be happy as the world is wide 
When I 
know I've got your heart, 
We shall never, never part; 
Hannah, Hannah, won't you be my bride ? 
Take me, etc.

I'm Going To Meet My Sister:7 
Words and music by W. H. DELEHANTY. 
W HEN I 
landed in New York, 
All the way from Cushaloch, 
Where the black birds sung their notes of lamentation 
In every little lay, 
Sure I 
thought I 
heard them say 
May good luck attend you, Pat, in every station. 
When I 
landed in New York 
Sure I 
thought that I'd get work, 
But I 
found that was a 
matter rather hard, so 
I 
must emigrate out west; 
There I 
think I'll do the best 
When I 
meet my sister Katie in Chicago. 
CHORUS. 
In Chicago, in the State of Illinois; 
But before I 
say adieu 
I 
will take a 
step or two 
Just as graceful as a 
little lustiardo. 
So blaze away and tear, 
Now the divil a 
hair I 
care, 
For I'm going to meet my sister in Chicago. 
Down at Castle Garden gate, 
Sure it's there I 
had to wait, 
Now I 
know ye's all will say it was a 
pity; 
The divil a 
one I 
found 
Who would show a 
Paddy round, 
So you see I'm led astray now in your city. 
And no matter where I 
be, 
All the boys make game of me, 
And they holler pipe the tarrier Bernardo; 
With their cry, " What d'ye saoy I" 
Faith me heart knows little joy, 
Till I 
meet my sister Katie in Chicago. 
In Chicago, etc.

Still my menfry will steal o'er 
To dat dear old Cabin floor, 
When de shadow of de sun came peeping in; 
At night, when all was dark, 
We would hear de watch-dog bark, 
And we'd listen to the murmur of the wind. 
It seem to say to me. 
"You people must be free," 
For de happy time am coming, Lord be praised! 
For then we would weep and moan, 
For our souls was not our our own, 
In dem agonizing, cruel slay'ry days.

am very old and feeble, 
And our life am nearly done; 
I

And I'm resting by de wayside wid my load.

Such an Education Has my Mary Anne. 
By Edward Harrigan. 
Music by David Braham. 
Sung in Harrigan's great sketch, The Mulligan Guard Picnic. 
Copyright by A. J. FISHER, 1878. 
My Mary Anne's a 
teacher in a 
great big public school, 
She get's one thousand dollars every year, 
She has charge of all the .children, you'd never find a 
fool, 
For Mary gives them all the proper steer. 
Oh, she studied Greek and Latin, rearFrench and Timbuctoo, 
German, Spanish, Turk and Hindoostan, Portuguese, Irish 
and Jerusalem Hebrew; 
Such and education has my Mary Anne. 
CHORUS. 
She's a 
darling, she's a 
daisy, 
She's a 
dumpling, she's a 
lamb; 
You should hear her play the pi-an-a, 
Such an education has my Mary Anne. 
My Mary Anne's a 
lady, no contemptible coquette, 
When I 
see her sure my heart goes in a 
drame; 
She is thoroughly conversant wid the art of etiquette, 
And at cards she'd beat old Hoyle himself a 
game. 
Oh, she'd play you whist or cribbage, forty-fives or casino, 
And she'll dale the cards just like a ganiblin man, poker or 
peaknuckle, or Sanky oh Pedro, 
Such an education has my Mary Anne. 
She's a 
darling, &c. 
My Mary Anne's a 
dancer in the art of terpsichore, 
You should see her forward four and alamandi 
She'd break up all the lumber that you'd put down on the floor, 
Such a 
heavy stepper is my Mary Anne. 
Oh, she'd dance you the mazourka, a 
polka or quadrille, 
Reel or jig or shuffle in the sand, schottishe or the German you 
could'nt keep her still. 
Such an education has my Mary Anne. 
She's a 
darling, &c.

Darling one, when first I 
met you, 
When I 
pledged you hand and heart; 
There were roses on your cheeks, love, 
And we vow'd we ne'er would part: 
One more kiss, for I 
am going, 
Par beyond all earthly woes; 
Let my grave be like your cheeks, love, 
Covered- with the blushing rose.-- Cho.

DUTCH SONG. 
Written for Watson & Ellis by Wm. J. Scanlon. 
I'll sing of a 
Deitcher boy, 
A 
boy who loves me, 
You peoples must all know him well, 
He sells sausages in all the saloons, 
He's the owner of a 
sausage hotel, 
lie can sing, he can dance, he can play the trombone, 
The finest you ever did see, 
He drinks lager beer to make himself fat, 
And he loves to eat good bologne. 
CHORUS. 
I 
love Jokey, I 
love Jokey, 
And Jokey he loves me, 
We eat pretzels, drink lager beer. 
Vere ever we may be. 
(Repeat.) 
To-night he is coming here to see me, 
Ve're going to a 
masquerade ball; 
Yen I 
am dressed up in my fancy clothes, 
You bet I'm the belle of them all. 
And venever my Jokey is by my side, 
How happy I 
always do feel, 
We sing the sweet songs of our faderland, 
Then around on this floor we do spiel. 
(Chorus.) 
Lily of the Valley. 
SONG AND DANCE. 
Will you take a 
little ramble in the country? 
'Tis only just a 
little way from town, 
To an ivy-covered cottage in the valley, 
Where dwells a 
lovely maiden of renown. 
And sh.'s the sweetest girl by far 
That ever I 
did see, 
Among the pretty girls a 
star 
She always seems to me. 
CHORUS. 
She's the lily of the valley, (Break.) 
And the maid I 
hope to marry. (Break.) 
Then come and take a 
ramble in the country, 
To where the scent of roses fills the air. 
Oh come and see the lily of the valley, 
All in her golden beauty sweet and fair. 
Oh, you should see her early in the morning, 
That's when she goes for water at the vpring, 
And see the smile her lovely face adorning, 
And hear the charming songs I 
heard her sing. 
Her smile you never could forget, 
It would haunt your lonely hours 
With happy thoughts of when you met 
My love among the flowers. 
She's the lily &e.

NOTL—The music of the two bars marked by stars must be repeated 
as often as is necessary for the words, 
2. 
A 
dog the old woman saw walking past, 
When she'd waited a 
little while: 
Dear dog, said she, will you bite my pig, 
And make it go over the stile. 
Oh, my, was the old woman's cry, 
She was in a 
dreadful plight; 
Dog, dog, bite pig, 
Pig won't get over the stile, 
And I'll never get home to night. 
3. 
The dog looked up at the dame and smiled, 
But politely declined the job: 
When the dame by her side, a 
stick descried 
And asked it to beat the dog. 
Oh, my, was the old woman's cry, 
She was in a 
dreadful plight; 
Stick, stick, beat dog, dog won't bite pig, 
Pig won't get over the stile, 
And I'll never get home to night. 
4. 
The stick then replied, pray excuse me, old dame; 
For I 
feel so lazy and thick; 
When the old woman saw a 
blazing fire, 
And begged it would burn the stick. 
Oh, my, was the old woman's cry, 
She was in a 
dreadful plight; 
Fire, fire, burn stick, stick won't beat dog, 
Dog won't bite pig, 
Pig won't get over the stile, 
And I'll never get home to night. 
5. 
Said the fire, the stick is so large and thick, 
Of my job very soon I 
should tire; 
When the dame discovered some water near, 
And prayed it would quench the fire. 
Oh, my, was the old woman's cry, 
She was in a 
dreadful plight; 
Water, water, quench fire, 
Fire won't burn stick, stick won't beat dog, 
Dog won't bite pig, 
Pig won't get over the stile, 
And I'll never get home to night. 
6. 
The water said, Madam, I 
beg to decline, 
For I 
don't see why I 
oughter; 
When seeing an Ox, a 
taking a 
walk, 
She begged it would drink the water. 
0, my, was the old woman's cry, 
Ox, ox, drink water, water won't quench fire, 
Fire won't burn stick, stick IA 
on't beat dog, 
Dog won't bite pig, 
Pig won't get over the stile, 
And I'll never get home to night 
7. 
The Ox said, old woman, I'll do no such thing 
Such a 
deed my feeling shocks: 
When a 
butcher passing, the dame entreated 
That he would kill the ox. 
Oh, uty, was the old woman's cry, 
She was in a 
dreadful plight; 
Butcher, butcher, kill ox, ox won't drink water, 
Water won't quench fire, 
Fire won't burn stick, stick won't beat dog, 
Dog won't bite pig, 
Pig won't get over the stile, 
And I'll never get home to night. 
8. 
The butcher then answered, with pleasure, dear dame, 
For the ox to you has been rude; 
I'll kill it dame, and cut it up, 
For I 
know it will make good food. 
Oh, my, was the old woman's cry 
Recovering from her fright, 
For the butcher began to kill the ox, 
The ox began to drink the water, 
The water began to quench the fire, 
The fire began to burn the stick, 
The stick began to beat the dog, 
The dog began to bite the pig, 
The pig at once got over the stile, 
And the dame got home safely that night.

I'VE lust arrived in town to-day, 
And here I 
is before you, 
To sing about my name and occupation; 
I 
come from Old Virginia State, 
De best in all de nation; 
Oh, ho ! oh! ho! to Nicodemus Johnson. 
My master was a 
Union man, 
lie did not like Secession; 
And so, he had to leave the old plantation; 
I 
thought to stay behind him there, 
'Twould be an aggravation: 
Oh, ho! oh! ho! to Nicodemus Johnson. 
I'se glad dis war come to an end, 
And peace come fro'd de nation; 
I'll go right back to Dixie's land, and stay dar! 
For, I 
isn't any contraband, 
I 
love Cie old plantation; 
Oh, ho

Sweet woman she was intended to be, 
Everything that is nice! 
But sometimes she's as hot as the mustard pot, 
And sometimes far colder than ice I

That's likely to lead to family Jars,

REMEMBER YOU HAVE CHILDREN OF 
YOUR OWN 
An original song by FRANK LEWIS. 
Sung at the Olympic 
Theatre, N. Y. 
Music published by E. H. 
HARDING, 229 Bower:. 
Price 35 
cents. 
Copyright secured. 
In your path through life each day, you will meet upon the 
way, 
Fellow mortals upon whom this world cloth frown, 
Who, from poverty or crime, have fallen in their time, 
Or by circumstances crushed and striken down; 
Young men with blighted names, who once had noble aims, 
Young girls with shame and sorrow on their brow, 
Whom a 
kindly word might save, from a 
dark, dishonored 
grave, 
While a 
cruel one would drive to madness now. 
They were once to some one dear, so don't pass them with a 
sneer, 
But speak a 
kindly word in cheering tone; 
You know not what's in store, for the loved ones you adore, 
Renaember you have children of your own, 
The shop girls on the street, with as much respect should meet, 
As the millionaire who in his carriage rolls, 
And the honest laboring man, with his strong and horny hand, 
They too have hearts and feelings—yes, and souls; 
Their family is as dear to them as any here, 
Though their clothes nawr_14i4ragged, torn and.olcl, 
Dejected and forlorn, yet, still their hearts are warm, 
Though they lack the rich man's cheerful hom3 and gold. 
They are all to some one dear, so don't pass them with a 
jeer, 
But speak a 
gentle word in soothing tone; 
You know not what's in store, for those whom you adore, 
Reraomber you have children of your own. 
Don't despise the wretched poor, whom perhaps grim want 
may lure, 
To steal the bread their starving children crave, 
Be not the one to blame, you yourself would do the same, 
With starvation at your door you'd dare the grave; 
And the wretched drunkard, too, who perhaps was once like 
Respeeted and beloved by one and all, 
Who no doubt through care and strife, or some sorrow of their 
life, 
Have fallen, but not quite beyond recall. 
And the poor outcast forlorn, don't pass them by with scorn, 
But speak unto them in a 
gentle tone; 
Perhaps they're not to blame for their lives of ' in and shame, 
Remember you have children of your oi,v1)

THE STARS OF THE PERIODS 
Dedicated to Harrigan and Hart 
By EDWARD AUSTIN. 
Hasten for seats, do not delay, 
Great artists are in town to-day; 
And high upon the roll of fame, 
Resplendent shines their well-known name! 
Refinement's air pervades their acts, 
And what they do no neatness lacks; 
Reputation great they've earned and made, 
No one throws them in the shade! 
In their great act, " Slavery Days," 
Dearning applause they're sure to raise. 
Go and see the " Blue and Gray," 
Clasping hands in bright array; 
And " The Sixty Ninth" ( the " gallant,") 
Observe the boys possess men's talent. 
Nature, Harrigan has surely blest, 
Made him " different from the rest," 
And by his own majestic sway, 
Banish, he will, all care away. 
Next comes Tony, who sings so well, 
In dancing, none can him excel; 
Devoid of all that's stale or low, 
No rival does this artist know. 
Homage should to both be paid: 
Astonishing is " The Day Parade ;" 
And other sketches they will do 
That are to life and nature true. 
Remember, the music of excellent worth 
In the mind of Braham had its birth 
Then the manager of this great team— 
Obliging Hanley—deserves esteem ! 
S 
ATISPACTION, great, is given to all— 
Now don't fagot this night to call. 
Funnygraphs,

NEVER interfere with a 
policeman in the discharge of his 
pistol. 
NOT every one can tell when hot weather is coming. 
Some err. 
THERE is nothing in the world which keeps Lent so well as 
an umbrella. 
MAN glories in his strength; woman glories in her hair; 
butter glories in both. 
THERE are 3,064 languages spoken, and a 
man feels like 
using all of them when he sits down on a 
cat. 
I 
CAN not find time to sing the song sent me, beginning, 
" 
Fill up with wine your flowing bowels." 
The spelling is 
not correct. 
"ARE there any fools in this town ?" asked a 
stranger of a 
newsboy, recently. " I 
don't know," replied the boy; " why, 
are you lonesome ?" 
DAN COLLYER says he once prevented a 
severe case of hydro-
phobia by simply getting on a 
high fence, and sitting there 
for two hours and a 
half, until the dog had gone away. 
PETER QUIGG, entertaining some serious doubts 
Of his consort's connubial devotion, 
Took an arsenic lunch, then indulged in a 
dive 
In eternity's fathomless ocean. 
A GOOD way to restore a 
man apparently drowned is to 
first dry him thoroughly, inside and out, and then clap a 
speaking trumpet to his ear and inform him that his mother-
in-law's dead. 
THE most interesting part of a 
man's life occurs when he 
watches a 
woman get over the fence. 
First she looks to see 
if anybody is watching her. 
Then she gathers her skirts 
around her, and the man wonders if she will hop over. 
She 
then takes another look and—crawls under the fence. 
Words and music by TIM ROGERS, as sung by him with greai 
success at HARRIGAN rk HART'S Theater Comlque. 
I 
AM a 
swell. I 
lead the style; 
I'm not Champagne Charlie nor Tommy Coaloil. 
But you can see plain by my winning ways 
That I 
am a 
man that has seen better days. 
But for all that I 
don't care a 
straw, 
For I'm just tos lively as ever, ha, ha! 
The pet of the girls I 
meet every day, 
And as they pass by me this is what they say: 
Oh, my, ain't he a 
baby' 
Look at his walk—it's just like a 
lady 
Oh dear, 1 
believe it is Grady! 
Look at his nice curly hair. 
Look at me well. 
Do I 
look green ? 
I 
have an eye that can capture a 
queen. 
With my graceful walk I 
make their heads whirl; 
My great Colorados the barbers do curl. 
I 
am a 
gambler at high jack and 'ow; 
I 
can play seven out and the great casino. 
There's no use in talking, now don't I 
look sweet? 
For as the girl* pass L.10 you'll hear them repeat: 
Oh, my, etc. 
Erin's Isle. 
PAT ROONEY 'S SONG AND DANCE . 
Composed by B. 
H ART, 
Copyrighted by A. 
J. FISHER, 1879. 
Here I 
am, an Irish lad, that you can plainly see, 
I've traveled this world o'er and o'er, till I 
got to this land 
of the free. 
From Dublin Bay I 
came away, I 
never fret or sigh, 
For I'm always gay, both night and day, this son of Erin's Isle. 
CHORUS. 
Yes, I 
am an Irish ranting blade, and that I 
never deny, 
And I'll give you all a 
chance for to see the way I 
dance, 
As they do in Erin's Isle. (Repeat.) 
The other day I 
went astray, I 
never shall forget, 
When a 
pretty little Irish girl oh I 
by chance had met. 
She showed me home, that I 
will own, and this was her reply:

Sweet Alice Aleen, 
Written for and dedicated to the FRENCH TWIN SISTERS, by J. 1'. KELLY. 
Copyrighted by A. J. FISHER, 29 Vesey street, New York, x879. 
One summers morn while wandering, 
Down through the fields so green, 
Where the hawthorn blossoms sweetly blow, 
I 
meet Alice Aleen. 
So flaxen were her ringlets, 
Her eyes of bonny blue, 
So laughing and bewitching, 
Like a 
dart they pierced me through and through, 
CHORUS. 
When rosy May comes in with flowers, (Sym). 
To deck her gay green spreading bowers; (Sym.) 
It's then I 
love to roam with her, my little bright sunbeam, 
She is my life, my guiding star, my sweet Alice Aleen. 
In a 
shady grove far down the lane, 
In love's sweet peaceful bower, 
Beside a 
falling crystal stream, 
Oh what a 
blissful hour. 
'Twas there she whispered, " I 
am thine," 
In tones so lovingly; 
Then murmered low, " When we are wed, 
how happy, dearest, we will be." 
When rosy May, &c.

When My Ship Comes In. 
As sung by the FRENCH TWIN SISTERS. 
When the little birds begin to sing, 
And the sily'ry notes from their yellow throats 
Make the valleys and the woodlands ring 
With their music soft and low, 
I 
love to wander down beside the stream, 
In the twilight ray so dim, 
And I 
watch each night by the moon's pale light, 
For I'm waiting till my ship comes in. 
Ship ahoy ! 
CHORUS. 
When the little birds begin to sing, 
And the silv'ry notes from their yellow throats 
Make the valley and the woodlands ring, 
Then I'm waiting till my ship comes in. 
[Repeat last line.] 
Oh, my love has gone across the sea, 
For he sailed away on a 
summer's day, 
And he took my loving heart from me, 
With his uniform so grand. 
He sailed away with heart so light and gay, 
In a 
ship so neat and trim, 
And no joy I'll see till he comes back to me, 
So I'm waiting till my ship comes in. 
When the little birds, 8ce. 
Oh, they say he'll be a 
captain bold, 
And will have command of a 
ship so grand, 
But I'm waiting, too, for something more, 
When my love comes back to me. 
For then I 
shall be dearer far to him 
Than the rank he strove to win ; 
And my heart beats light, as I 
watch to-night, 
For I'm waiting till my ship comes in. 
When the little birds, & c.

A 
Little Book has lately appeared in print at Mr. A. J. 
FISHER'S, 98 Nas 
sau street, called the " Little Flirt." Ilre cannot say that we recommend 
it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, as we think it would only 
encourage the bad habit of " flirting." Unfortunately, there is enough 
of it done without.any further necessity of explaining ' how, when and 
where to do it," and this little volume would advise and initie the un-
corrupted in practicing what is commonly called "flirting." - , 
The N. Y. Evening Telegram writes : " We have lately seen a 
neatiortile 
book, bound in )4orocco leather, costing twenty-five cents, called the 
"Little Flirt," published by A. J. 
FISHER, No. 98 Nassau Street. 
It 
gives information of the modus operandi of flirting, and of the mean-
ing of every motion of the handkerchief, fan, glove and parasol. As 
there is nothing at all objectionable in the volume, and its contents 
might afford some innocent amusement to many, we do not hesitate to 
recommend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers."

Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such P. way as to be non-coininittal. 
Many young ladies are visited by 
-
..-.tlemen who are either too diffi-
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. 
The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unladylike encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
' 
tedious existence, which miasht have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. 
This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi. 
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need net be 
adopted by the parties to th e 
game 
as 
thei
r 
own, 
unless 
it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes a 
further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties
