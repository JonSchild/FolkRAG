THE WATERMILL. 
As Recited by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
LISTEN to the watermill, through the livelong day, 
flow the clicking of its wheel wears the hours away, 
Languidly the autumn wind stirs the greenwood leaves; 
From the fields the reapers sing, binding up the sheaves ; 
And a 
proverb haunts my mind, as a 
spell is cast— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Autumn winds revive no more leaves that once are shed. 
And. the sickle cannot reap corn once gathered; 
And the rippling stream flows on, tranquil, deep, and still, 
Never gliding back again to the watermill. 
Truly speaks the proverb old, with a 
meaning vast— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Take the lesson to thyself, loving heart, and true; 
Golden years are fleeting by ; youth is passing, too; 
Learn to make the most of life, lose no happy day, 
Time will never bring thee back chances swept away ; 
Leave no tender word unsaid, love, while love shall last— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Work while yet the daylight shines, man of strength and 
Never t
wloile
ls
, the streamlet glide useless by the mill ; 
Wait not till to-morrow's sun beams upon the way, 
All that thou canst call thine own lies in thy—to-day ; 
Power, intellect, and health may not always last— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Oh! the wasted hours of life that have drifted by; 
Oh ! the good we might have done, lost without a 
sigh ! 
Love that we might once have saved by a 
single word, 
Thoughts conceived, but never penned, perishing, un-
heard. 
Take the proverb to thine heart, take and hold it fast— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Oh! love thy God and fellow-man, thyself consider last • 
For come it will, when thou must scan dark errors of the 
past; 
And when the fight of life is o'er, and earth recedes from 
view, 
And Heaven in all its glory shines, 'midst the pure, the 
good, the true— 
Then you'll see more clearly the proverb deep and vast— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
CUSTARD PIES. 
Written and sung by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
DERR'S a 
blace dot is better clan dis— 
Und I 
vish in my heart I 
vos dere— 
It's a 
dining saloon dot I 
mean, 
Und you'll always find on de bill of fare— 
CHORUS. 
Custard pies, custard pies ; 
• 
How I 
vish I 
could see dem vonce more. 
Custard pies, full of flies, 
Ye shall eat on dot beautiful shore. 
I 
remember, yen I 
vent to school— 
Und time it never can erase— 
I 
got in a 
fight dere, vone day, 
Und a 
fellar hit me right in de face, 
Mit—Custard pies, etc. 
Und yen at lasd I 
have to die, 
Und dey lay me avay in de tomb, 
I 
hope all my friends dot are left, 
Viii see planted o'er me, in full bloom— 
Custard pies, etc. 
Written and sung by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
I 
KEEP a 
stable vay up town, und I 
have horses rare, 
De finest teams in all de vorld I'm sure you vill find dere; 
Among de many who have got deir horses in my place 
Is Dingelbender, und he owns a 
mule vot runs a 
race. 
CHORUS. 
Of all de droubles dot I've had since first I 
vent to school, 
I 
don't clink anyding's as bad as Dingelbender's mule. 
Of I 
go in his stall at night he knows me right avay, 
Und for his broder dree miles off he loudly den vill bray, 
Dot vakes up all de horses den, und such an awful noise 
As dey vill make, 'twould drive you mad, but I'm vone 
of de boys. 
SPOKEN.—He is vone of de nicest mules, sound und 
kind in harness—of you can ontly get id on him—dot 
dere is in de country. 
He vos an awful kicker dough ; 
he can kick de barn into kindling vood in abond two sec-
onds. 
I 
took him to a 
fair vonce; de judge vos going to 
give him de firsd prize ; de mule made a 
kick 
we found 
a. 
collar button ; we haven't seen de judge dough ; I 
dink 
he vos somevere; he'll .come down alder a 
vile. 
He aint 
much of a 
saddle mule, not dot he vould trow his rider, 
but de saddle itches his back, mid he has a 
habit of going 
up alongside of a 
house, und rubbing a 
fellow's leg off, 
und dot aint very pleasant. 
Dot's de reason I 
say— 
Of all de droubles, etc.

Boston, Mass. 
VILE going down town vone fine day last vinter, 
A 
telegraph office I 
happened to pass ; 
And right alongside of an insdrument sidding, 
Vos a 
neat, but a 
pretty und modest young lass ; 
By N
-ay of acquaintance I 
gwick sent a 
message 
To my married sister who lives oral of town, 
Und I 
told de young girl I 
vould vait for de answer, 
Und den she politely asked me to sit down. 
SPONEN.—I 
sat down, und ve commenced to talk aboud 
diamond jewelry und rotten eggs, mid dings like dot, 
mid I 
vos just going to kiss her, yen de answer from my 
sister came over de wires, mit a— 
CHORUS. 
Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick,

Music vich I 
tought so sweet ; 
Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, 
Yen Maria -and I 
first did meet. 
I 
den vent to see her not very long afder, 
Introduced to her larder, her moder as yell. 
Her sister, her broders, her aunt, mid her uncles, 
Und so many relatives I 
cannot tell ; 
Ye used to go valking out on moonlight evenings, 
Ye spoke of pure love, und I 
tell you 'dwas fine, 
Till at Lisa, I 
managed for to get up courage, 
Und I 
asked dot young gal off she vould be mine. 
SroicEN.—I said to her, " Oof you love me, as I 
dr. 
you., no spitz dog can cut our love in two pieces." 
Und 
ven I 
got (Trough she didn't say, " Allow me a 
few mo-
ments to compose myself," or " My leetle heart is flutter-
ing." 
Dere vos no soft language like dot ; she jumped

Ve've been married dree years now, mid ve have five 
children, 
Dere's two pair of girl twins und vone bouncing boy, 
Und all de neighbors say ye should be happy, 
But I

Her relations too dey are all living mit us, 
Und never a

Dey sleep half de time, dey eat all de victuals, 
Vile I

FOR WE'RE JOLLY. 
As sung by Gus WILLIAMS. 
Oir, let us jog along, boys, easily through life, 
And let our hearts be gay through all its storms and strife; 
We'll smile at all the cares that meet us unawares 
As we go jogging on, boys. 
CHORUS. 
For we're jolly, yes, so jolly, ever merry, jolly very, 
And we'll sing a 
merry song as we go jogging on, 
As we go jogging on, boys. 
Come, let us laugh at love, boys, scoff at Cupid's darts, 
And care not if he choose to plague us with his arts ; 
If e'er the fair are cold, we'll win them if we're bold, 
So let us laugh at love, boys. 
For. 
we're jolly, etc. 
Yes, let us jog along, boys, we can ne'er do wrong, 
If but our hearts to joy and mirthfulness belong, 
So let us happy be and jolly, gay, and free, 
As we go jogging on, boys_

2 
The first on the page is little Sally Sage, 
She once was a 
lady's maid: 
But she ran away on a 
very dark day, 
With a 
fellow in the fried fish trade. 
The next was a 
Cook, oh! a 
beauty with a 
hook, 
And I'll tell you the reason why! 
For a 
leg she'd a 
stump, on her back was a 
hump, 
And she'd got a 
little squint in her eye !—Cno. 
3 
Another one to charm was a 
Girl on a 
farm, 
Well versed in the harrows and ploughs; 
She guarded the rigs of a 
lot of little pigs, 
And squeezed new milk from the Cows. 
She was sixteen stone all muscle and bone, 
And she looked with an awful leer; 
And she would have been mine, lint fell in a 
decline, 
Thro' swallowing a 
mouse in her beer !—Cno. 
4 
Then another one came, ah, a 
right jolly Dame, 
And her purse was as long as my arm, 
All full of yellow gold, such a 
sight to behold ! 
Would the heart of a 
miser warm. 
And her only sin was a 
love for gin, 
But it brought our hopes to a 
wreck; 
For she slipp'd with her heel on a 
bit of orange peel, 
Fell down and broke her blessed neck—Cno. 
5 
I 
could add to the score full a 
half dozen more, 
For the list is a 
long way round; 
One went o'er the sea for a 
better chap than me, 
And some of them were hanged or drowned. 
And the last I 
had through drink went mad, 
In vain I 
tried to stop her: 
And sad was rnv dismay to discover that one day, 
She'd been slowly boiled to death in the Copper.

THE DOUBLE-BREASTED MANSION. 
As 
sung by Gus WILLIAms. 
TuNE.—" Old Log Cabin in the Lane." 
I 
VONCE vos young uncl gallus, und I 
drove a 
pair of 
grays, 
I 
clink about 6.90 vos de pace ; 
I 
had fifty dousand servant gals ( but don't give dot avay), 
Und a 
trotting cow I 
sent to every race; 
I 
had forty -dousands gold mines, I owned half of de 
vorld— 
No yonder dat de statement makes you stare ;— 
I 
had two million bull-pups, und all dere tails curled up, 
In my double-breasted mansion in de square. 
CHORUS. 
De roof vos copper-bottomed, de chimney solid gold, 
I'd an elevator placed on every stair; 
But I 
lost de lot at keno, und I'll never more behold 
My double-breasted mansion on de square. 
Ten million head of cattle used to roam about my farm, 
Und each hog had a 
splendid feather bed, 
I 
had males und female roosders, und dey took deir vis-
key varm; 
Dey vere de shanghai, shanghoo, China bred ; 
My cornfields yielded butter, my peach trees yielded 
cream; 
I 
used to sow and mow de yellow pear; 
But alas, my vealth is vanished now, und every night I 
dream 
Of my double-breastad mansion on de square. 
De roof vos copper-bottomed, etc. 
I 
never shall forget de time, not many years ago, 
\Ten de bummers used to roam about my door, 
Dey vould get outside my viskey und smoke up my cigars, 
My servant gals und hash dey did adore : 
De scenes have changed about de place, und I 
am poor 
myself; 
At a 
free-lunch I 
could take a 
quiet share, 
I 
am clinking of the schweitzer cheese dot once I 
used to 
eat 
In my double-breasted mansion on de square. 
De roof vos eopper-bottemed, etc.

Hateful I'd be to drow you ond de door,

SOMETHING ABOUT NOTHING. 
TRANSLATION FROM THE GERMAN. 
NOTHING is nothing, and yet is nothing nothing of an 
insignificant nature, because there is nothing else more 
important in its expressions and consequences than— 
nothi4 ; consequently, nothing is actually of great im-
portance. 
The world is created out of —nothing. 
Noth-
ing sharpens the dagger of the banditti—it leads the 
vagabond to crime, and brings the murderer to the scaf-
fold. 
Nothing is a 
golden spur to the noble-minded and 
the active. 
Nothing is the leading star to him who is 
nothing, and who does not want to remain nothing. 
He 
who can see cm, "',t see nothing ; but the blind cap see it— 
it is the world of the blind. 
He who does see, and secs 
nothing, who does hear, and hears nothing, acts very pru-
dently, and the prudent man is respected by his neighbors. 
Nothing is the lulling- cradle of the blockhead. 
Nothing 
is the speech of the fool ; and to know nothing the wis-
dom of the wise. 
Nothing is the gift of the miser. 
Nothing is the paradise of the fanatic ; and nothing is 
my motive in writing something about nothing. 
12 
FAREWELL TO LOVE, 
LOVE, I'll have naught to do with theo, 
Since thou so oft last fooled me ; 
Thy seeming joys are poor deceits; 
Thy promises are painted baits ; 
Thy truths, I 
think, are naught but lies ; 
Thy reasons shallow sophistries, 
All thy endeavors, all thy arts, 
Tend but to vex those simple hearts 
Which trust to the. 
Alas ! mine own 
Oft thy malicious tricks have known ; 
Oft when to me thou hast promised heaven. 
The tortures of a 
hell were given ; 
All the delights to me thou bast brought 
Have been with hidden cankers fraught, 
And passed away, like blossoms bright 
At morn, but dead ere fall of night. 
Too long I've lived beneath, thy reign, 
And now, at last, I 
break the chain, 
And bold declare my heart is free 
From all thy petty tyranny ; 
It may be thou again wilt take 
It captive, and, indignant, make me all too late 
Reput the crime of treason 'gainst thee. 
Till that time I'll joy me in my freedom new, 
As if thou were not, Love—Ailien I

" 
DORKINS WAS TIGHT." 
Written by BENJ. D. 
Comaxs. Sung by Gus WiLmexs. 
THE theatre was full, and so were the actors, 
Dan Dorkins was going to appear 
That night in a 
bare-footed slack-wire clog, 
For he was the Pompey round here. 
The bar-room was fearfully crowded with beats 
Who awaited a 
pleasant surprise; 
For they knew they would eat 
When the lunch was set out, 
And they longed for the curtain to rise. 
The eurtain arose, and so did the people, 
Who began to shout and hurrah; 
Dan Dorkins came out with young Oliver Twist, 
But they gave him the laugh and yah! yah! 
The play it began when the curtain went up, 
But something was wrong I 
felt sure ; 
"He's away off his base," says John Jas. Mansfield, 
That never went back on the poor. 
A 
brick—well it was—I 
saw Dorkins start, 
And carom on the dark red for two; 
And it made me feel thirsty to see how he worked, 
But continually dropping his cue. 
He says, " fin the icing," when a 
woman jumped up 
Cried, " you lie, for you're one of the gang, 
And you owe me for washing." That knocked Dorkins 
cold,' 
And his head on his breast did hang. 
At length the footlights he approached with a 
rush, 
And " Ladies and gentlemen," said, 
" 
If I 
haven't drank enough bourbon to-night, 
The fault is ray wealth, not my head. 
Many a 
time I 
have made you all sick, 
And get up and go out for a 
beer; 
When me and Jim Stokes walked a 
mile in a 
week, 
How I 
wish Dan O'Leary was here. 
You insult me to-night and say I 
am sober, 
For years I've been a 
Hamlet alone ; 
I'll tell you the reason, I 
know you will treat, 
I've a 
mother-in-law dead—drunk at home."

In every neighbor comes;

W HEN I 
was a 
boy I 
was brimful of fun, 
For all sorts of tricks I 
was noted; 
From morning till evening I 
never was done, 
On rollicking pleasure I 
doted. 
I 
tried ey'ry game, and when winter-time came, 
With joy I 
was all in a 
flutter; 
Then, out on the ice, 0, I 
tell you 'twas nice— 
I 
went skating on one in the gutter! 
CHORUS. 
Skating on one, skating on one! 
0; boys, there was never such glorious fun; 
All other pleasures of youth I 
would shun, 
And go skating on one in the gutter ! 
I 
beat all the boys with my far-fetching stride, 
In fact I 
was never artistic; 
While backward and forward so graceful did glide, 
I 
thought ev'ry motion majestic. 
I 
cared not to skate on the rink or the park, 
You may b'lieve it's the truth which I 
utter, 
The best of all pleasures from daylight till dark, 
Was skating on one in the gutter 1 
Skating on one, etc. 
To join in the sport I 
would loiter from school, 
And gain the great wrath of my master ; 
Sometimes on the ice I 
would get a 
great fall, 
And go home for a 
piece of shin-plaster. 
And oft thro' the day I 
would steal soft away, 
With a 
hungry boy's balm, bread and butter, 
To meet my companions, so noisy and gay, 
And go skating on one in the gutter ! 
Skating on one, etc, 
COUNTRY LIFE FOR ME. 
Written and sung by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
Somn people like de city, because such fun is dere; 
But I 
prefer de country, mit blenty of fresh air. 
I 
love to see de green, green hills, in glorious summer 
time, 
To valk along down by de stream and up de hills to 
climb. 
So give to me de country, mit plenty of fresh air, 
It beats de city, dice to von, and drives avay dull care! 
It's nice ven it is vinter, und dere is blenty ice, 
To take a 
gal out sleighing—I 
dell you it is nice. 
De jingle jingle of de bells, as 'long de road ve go ; 
To strike a 
bank, -and den upset, it is such fun, you 
know. 
SPOKEN.—It's so nice to be in de country during de 
Tinter, to sit around a 
fire—made out of your neighbor's 
vood—dot he made you a 
present of de night before. 
Tood cost noting in de country—except de risk of going 
for it. 
I 
remember going for a 
load of vood, und de 
doctor vos (Tree veeks picking bullets out of me. 
It's so 
nice to sit around de fire, and vatch de sparks go up de 
chimney. 
It brings back to your mind de days ven you 
vere small, und vent to jail—Sunday-school I 
mean. 
So give to me de country, cte. 
THE TROMBONE PLAYER. 
As sung by Gus Wuxtexs. 
I 
VONCE VOS so jolly, dough now meloncholy, 
Since I 
lost my Kadey I've nearly gone mad; 
A 
servant domesdic, of figure majesdic, 
To fly mit mine rival was rader too bad. 
He played a 
drombone in a 
band in de sdreet, 
He'd hand 'round his hat every day ; 
For him she has left me, of her he's bereft me ; 
My Kadey, dear Kadey, de best in de land. 
She left me to bellar ; she vent vit dot fellar 
Dot blays de drombone in a 
German sdreet band. 
CHORUS. 
Born, born, born, born, born, de music used to blay, 
As dey dravelled drough de land ; 
Und he'd born, boin, born, mid he homed my girl avay, 
Did dot fellar in dot German band. 
He'd blay in de sdreet, und each day I 
would meet 
My Kadey a-valking a 
hold of his hand. 
I 
den saw my fate, I 
knew I 
vos late, 
Und dot she had promised for to join de band. 
I 
asged her de reason, she laughed in my face, 
Und said I 
might go to de doose. 
My faithful love scorning, she left me dot morning, 
My Kadey, dear Kadey, de best in de land. 
I 
know he. vill mind her, I 
never shall find her, 
Unless mit dot chap in de German sdreet band.

I 
OPENED the leaves of a 
book last night, 
The dust on its cover lay dusk and brown; 
As I 
held it toward the waning light, 
A 
withered flowret fell rustling down. 
'Twas only the wraith of a 
woodland weed, 
Which a 
dear dead hand in the days of ola 
Had placed 'twixt the pages she loved to read, 
At the time when my vows of love were told. 
And memories sweet, but as sad as sweet, 
Swift flooded mine eyes with regretful tears, 
When the dry dim hare- bell skimm'd past my feet, 
Recalling an hour from the vanished years. 
Once more I 
was watching hem deep fringed eyes, 
Bent over the Tasso upon her knee, 
And the fair face blushing with sweet surprise 
At the passionate pleading that broke from Inc. 
Oh, Ruby ! my darling, the small white band 
Which gathered the hare-bell was never my own, 
But faded and passed to the far-off land, 
And I 
dreamt by the flick'ring flame alone. 
I 
gathered the flower and I 
closed the leaves, 
And folded my hands in silent prayer, 
That the reaper Death as he seeks Ins sheaves, 
Might hasten the hour of our meeting there.

OH I 
WON'T YOU PLEASE ARRANGE ?

I'LL tell you of a 
darling girl, that I 
once thought a 
saint, 
But some good people used to say she did not lack for 
paint. 
But to forward this sad story, there is one thing I'll 
declare, 
The curls that hung about her face were nothing but 
false hair. 
SPOKEN.—FaIse, yes, false ! 
Whilepromenading, I 
dis-
covered a wayward tress meandering down her placid 
brow-, and, most carefully taking the little truant, I 
said, 
" 
My dear," 
CHORUS. 
Oh, won't you please arrange this thing, to me so strange ! 
But, no ! 
Oh, no ! 
She' kept me on the go ! 
And as we moved about, the people all did shout, 
Ha-ha I Ho-ho ! 
She's the sweetest girl that's out ! 
And as we moved along the street, among the festive 
throng, 
An accident befell her—I'll relate it in my song. 
By some mishap or other, from her head fell off a 
wreath; 
She stooped to pick it up, and out dropped a 
set of teeth. 
SPoKEN.—Knowing modesty to be the best policy, I 
simply took the molars and said, " Precious one," 
Oh, won't you please arrange this thing, to me sq 
strange ? 
But, no ! 
Oh, no ! 
She kept me on the go ; 
And, as we moved about, the people all did shout, 
Ha-ha ! 
Ho-ho ! 
-What made you bring her out ? 
(1) 
OH! WONT YOU PLEASE ARRANGE ? 
Concluded. 
?3 
The people all began to smile, to see what had occurred, 
And I, among the others, had my laughing senses stirr'd. 
But she, poor creature, felt so bad, she could not do but 
cry ; 
To cap the climax of the whole, out dropped a 
large glass 
eye. 
SPOKEN.—Oh, was ever poor mortal so eyed before ? 
While thus bewildered and bewailing, a 
gentleman took 
that which had so long and tenderly gazed upon me, and 
said, " Madam," 
Oh, won't you please arrange this 
thing, to mo so 
strange ? 
But, no! 
Oh, no! 
She kept me on the go; 
And as we moved about, the people all did shout, 
Ha-ha! Ho-ho! Your darling, she's played out! 
I 
met her at the ball one eve, indulging in the dance ; 
All eyes were gazing eagerly, to see her form advance. 
I 
noticed how, in balancing, she always chose to walk, 
And soon found out the reason why—one leg was made 
of cork. 
SPOKEN. — Oh, what a 
scene was there, my country-
men! In the height of my glory, my unbounded plea-
sure, this artificial appendage went flying about the 
room ; and, in my frenzy, I 
rushed for the door. 
In a 
moment, a 
single moment, she had secured the treacher-
ous support, and with it raised above all heads, she cried 
aloud, " Duckie ! Duckie, darling,"  • 
Oh, won't you please arrange this thing, to you so 
strange ? 
But, no I Oh, no! I 
kept her on the go; 
And as we moved about, the people all did shout, 
Ha-ha! 
Ho-ho! 
She's turning wrong-side out!

JUST BEHIND THE SCENES. 
As sung by Gcs,WILLIAms. 
Words and Music by FRED ALBERT. 
This Music of this Song is published by E. II. Mumma, 223 Bowery, New 
York. Price 10 cents. 
WHnN but a 
little boy, oh, it really was my joy, 
To visit the Theatre I'll admit. 
How happy I 
could be, the performances to see, 
While seated in the gallery or pit. 
I 
fancied all was real that the curtain did reveal, 
But since that I 
have pass'd beyond my teens, 
I 
begin to understand, tho' in front it may look grand, 
'Tis very difrrent just ' Behind the Scenes." 
So if you will attend for a 
moment now, my friends, 
I'll do the best within my humble means, 
To show to you to-night, tho' in front it may look bright, 
'Tis very diff'rent just " Behind the Scenes." 
The comedian is- one who while causing lots of fun. 
His heart may yet hang heavy in his breast, 
And the man who plays the king, tho' it seems a 
curious 
thing, 
In private may be very poorly drest. 
The Ladies too—so fair, who go floating through the air, 
And look like little angels there instead, 
Sometimes have to roam unto a 
wretched home, 
And oftentimes go supper-less to bed; 
While those who play the parts of the men with stony 
hearts, 
And look as if their tempers were like fiends, 
Could you see them while away, you'd very likely say, 
They're the mildest looking men " Behind the Scenes." 
'Tis just the same in life, for what lots of care and strife, 
And suliering some folks will undergo, 
Just to cut a 
shine, and to make themselves look fine, 
And think of nothing else but outside show; 
(1) 
27 
JUST BEHIND THE SCENES.—Concluded. 
They fancy and sppose that those who wear good clothes 
Always look the richest and the best; 
But an honest heart and mind is respected most you'll find, 
No matter whether poor or richly drest. 
Still many one you know have caused themselves much 
woe, 
Through trying hard to live beyond their means, 
And though they wear a 
smile, yet really all the while 
They are very wretched just " Behind the Scenes." 
There's many a 
married pair, I've no doubt you are aware, 
Who in public are so tender and so kind, 
But could you only see them at home in privacy, 
A 
very different state of things you'd find. 
Sometimes it is the wife who's the cause of all the strife ; 
Sometimes it is the husband who's to blame, 
Let that be how it may who causes all the fray, 
Their quarrelling continues just the same. 
Yet still they try to hide, from all the world outside, 
The snarls and jars with which their household teems, 
And often when you hear them call each other dear, 
They hate each other just " Behind the Scenes." 
The wealthy and the great, who can ride about in state, 
And have a 
host of wealth at their command, 
Have, you may be sure, as many troubles to endure 
As those who are the humblest in the land ! 
For England's greatest sage says all the world's a 
stage, 
And each of us endeavor all our might, 
Our follies to conceal, and only to reveal 
That whis.ch is most pleasing to the sight. 
No matter where you go, from the highest to the low, 
From peasantry right up to kings and queens, 
'Whatever they enjoy there's something to annoy, 
If we could only see " Behind the Scenes." 
BUCK FANSHAW'S FUNERAL. 
By MARK TWAIN. 
SOMEBODY has said that in order to know a 
community, 
one must observe the style of its funerals and know what 
manner of men they bury with most ceremouy. 
I 
can-
not say which class we buried with most eclat in our 
"flush times," the distinguished public benefactor or the 
Listinguished rough—possibly the two chief grades or 
grand divisions of society honored their illustrious dead 
about equally; and hence, no doubt, the philosopher I 
have quoted from would have needed to see two represen-
tative funerals in Virginia before forming his estimate of 
the people. 
There- was a 
grand time over Buck Fanshaw when be 
died. 
He was a 
representative citizen. 
He had "killed 
his man," not in his own quarrel to be sure, but in de-
fence of a 
stranger beset by numbers. 
He had kept a 
sumptuous saloon. 
He had been the proprietor of a 
dashing 11 elpmete, whom he could have discarded without 
the formality of a 
divorce. 
He had held a 
high position 
in the fire department, and had been a 
very Warwick in 
politics. 
When he died there was great lamentation 
throughout the town, but especially in the vast bottom 
stratum of society. 
On the inquest it was shown that Buck Fanshaw, in the 
delirium of a 
wasting typhoid fever, had taken arsenic, 
shot himself through the body, cut his 
throat, and 
jumped out of a 
four-story window and broken his neck, 
and, after due deliberation, the jury, such and tearful, but 
with intelligence unblinded by its sorrow, brought in a 
verdict of " death by the visitation of Providence." 
_What could the world do without juries ! 
Prodigious preparations were made for the funeral. 
All the vehicles in town were hired, all the saloons were 
put in mourning, all the municipal and fire-company flags 
were hung at half-mast and all the firemen ordered to

BUCK FANSHA W 'S FUNERAL—Continued. 
muster in uniform, and bring their machines duly draped 
in black. 
Now—let us remark in parenthesis—as all the peoples 
of the earth had representative adventurers in the Silver-
land, and as each adventurer had brought the slang of 
his nation or his locality with him, the combination made 
the slang of Nevada the richest and the most infinitely 
varied and copious that had ever existed anywhere in the 
world, perhaps, except in the mines of California in the 
" 
early days." 
Slang was the language of Nevada. 
It 
was hard to preach a 
sermon without it, and be under-
stood. 
Such phrases as " You bet ! " " Oh, no I 
reckon 
not !" " No Irish need apply," and a 
hundred others, be-
came so common as to fall from the lips of a 
speaker un-
consciously—and very often when they did not touch the 
subject under discussion and consequently failed to mean 
anything. 
Regretful resolutions were passed and various commit-
tees appointed ; among others, a 
committee of one was 
deputed to call on the minister—a 
fragile, gentle, spirit-
ual new fledgling from an eastern theological seminary, 
and as yet unacquainted with the ways of the mines. 
The committee-man, " Scotty " Briggs, made his visit. 
Being admitted to his presence, he sat down before the 
clergyman, placed his fire-hat on an unfinished manu-
script sermon under the minister's nose, took from it a 
red silk handkerchief, wiped his brow, and heaved a 
sigh 
of dismal impressiveness, explanatory of his business. 
He choked and even shed tears, but with an effort he mas-
tered his voice, and said, in lugubrious tones : 
" 
Are you the duck that runs the gospel-mill next 
door ?" 
"Am I the—pardon me, I 
believe I 
do not under-
stand." 
With another sigh and a 
half sob Scotty rejoined : 
" Why, you see we are in a 
bit of trouble, and the

boys thought maybe you'd give us a 
lift, if we'd tackle 
you, that is, if I've got the rights of it, and you're the 
head clerk of the doxology works next door." 
" 
I 
am the shepherd in charge of the flock whose fold 
is next door." 
" 
The which ?" 
" 
The spiritual adviser of the little company of be-
lievers whose sanctuary adjoins these premises." 
Scotty scratched his head, reflected a 
moment, and 
then said : 
"You rather hold over me, pard. 
I 
reckon I 
can't call 
that card. 
Ante and pass the buck." 
" 
How ? I 
beg your pardon. 
What did I 
understand 
you to say ?" 
" 
Well, you've rather got the bulge on me. 
Or maybe 
we've both got the bulge, somehow. 
You don't smoke 
me and I 
don't smoke you. 
You see one of the boys has 
passed in his checks, and we want to give him a 
good 
send off, and so the thing I'm on now is to roust out 
somebody to jerk a 
little chin-music for us, and waltz 
him through handsome." 
" 
My friend, I 
seem to grow more and more bewildered. 
Your observations are wholly incomprehensible to me. 
Can you not simplify them some way ? 
At first I 
thought 
Perhaps I 
understood you, but I 
grope ECM Would it 
not expedite matters if you restricted yourself to cate-
gorical statements of fact unincumbered with obstructing 
accmnulations of metaphor and allegory ?" 
Another pause and more reflection. 
Then Scotty said; 
" 
I'll have to pass, I 
judge." 
" 
How ?" 
" 
You've raised me out, pard." 
" 
I 
still fail to catch your meaning." 
" 
Why, that last lead of your'n is too many for me— 
that's the idea. 
I 
can't neither trump nor follow suit." 
The clergyman sank back in his chair perplexed.

;Scotty leaned his head on his hand, and gave himself up 
to reflection. 
Presently his face came up, sorrowful, but 
confident. 
" 
I've got it now, so's you can savvy," said he. " What 
we want is a 
gospel- sharp. 
See ?" 
" 
A 
what ?" 
" 
Gospel-sharp. 
Parson." 
" 
Oh ! 
Why did you not say so before ? 
I am a 
clergyman—a 
parson." 
" 
Now you talk ! 
You see my blind, and straddle it 
like a 
man. 
Put it there !"—extending a 
brawny paw, 
which closed over the minister's small hand and gave it a 
shake indicative of fraternal sympathy and fervent grati-
fication. 
" 
Now we're all right, pard. 
Let's start fresh. 
Don't 
you mind me snuffling a 
little, becuz we're in a 
power of 
trouble. 
You see one of the boys has gone up the 
flume—" 
" 
Gone where ?" 
" 
Up the flume—throw'd up the sponge, you know." 
" 
Thrown up the sponge ?" 
" 
Yes—kicked the bucket—" 
" 
Ah—has departed to that mysterious country from 
whose bourne no traveller returns." 
"Return? 
Well I reckon not, 
Why, pard, he's 
(lead!'' 
" 
Yes, I 
understand." 
" 
Oh, you do ? 
Well, I 
thought maybe you might be 
getting tangled some more. 
Yes, you see he's dead 
again—" 
" 
Again ! 
Why, has he ever been dead before ?" 
" 
Dead before ? 
No. 
Do you reckon a 
man has got 
as many lives as a 
cat? But you bet he's awful dead 
now, poor old boy, and I 
wish I'd never seen this day. 
I 
don't want no better friend than Buck Faushaw. 
I 
know'd him by the back; and when I

him, I 
freeze to him—you hear me. 
Take him all round, 
pard, there never was a 
bullier man in the mines. 
No 
man ever know'd Buck Fanshaw to go back on a 
friend. 
But it's all up, you know ; it's all up. 
It ain't no use. 
They've scooped him !" 
" 
Scooped him ?" 
" 
Yes—death has. 
Well, 
him up. 
Yes, indeed. 
It's 
all, ain't it ? 
But, pard, he

Just spit in his 
cording to his strength, and it was just 
him peel and go in. 
He was the worst 
that ever dmw'd breath. 
Pard, he was 
on it bigger than an injun I" 
" 
On it ? 
On what ?" 
" 
On the- shoot. 
On the shoulder. 
On the fight. 
Understand ? 
He didn't give a 
continental—for any-
body. 
Beg your pardon, friend, for coming so near say-
ing a 
cuss word—but you see I'm on an awful strain in 
this palaver, on account of having to cramp down and 
draw everything so mild. 
But we've got to give him rip. 
There ain't any getting around that, I don't reckon. 
Now if we can get you to help plant him—" 
" 
Preach the funeral discourse ? 
Assist at the obse-
quies ?" 
" 
Obs'quies is good. 
Yes. 
That's it ; that's our little 
game. 
We are going to get up the thing regardless, you 
know. 
He was always nifty himself, and so you bet you 
his funeral ain't going to be no slouch ; solid silver door-
plate on his coffin, six plumes on the hearse, and a 
nigger 
on the box, with a 
bided shirt and a 
plug hat on—how's 
that for high ? 
And we'll take care of you, pard. 
We'll 
fix you all right. 
There will be a 
kerridge for you ; and 
whatever you want you just 'scape out, and we'll tend to 
it. 
We've got a

in No. l's house, and don't you be afraid. 
Just go in 
and toot your horn, if you don't sell a 
clam. 
Put Buck 
through as bully as you can, pard, for anyone that know'd 
him will tell you that he was one of the whitest men that 
was ever in the mines. 
You can't draw it too strong. 
He never could stand it to see things goin' wrong. 
He's 
done more to make this town peaceable than any man in 
it. 
I've seen him lick four greasers in eleven minutes, 
myself. 
If a 
thing wanted regulating, he warn't a 
man 
to go browsing around after somebody to do it, but he 
would prance in and regulate it himself. 
He warn't 
Catholic ; but it didn't make no difference about that 
when it came down to what a 
man's rights was—and so, 
when some roughs jumped the Catholic boney-ard and 
started to stake out town lots in it, he went for 'em, and 
cleaned 'em too ! 
I 
was there, pard, and I 
seen it my-
self." 
"That was very well, indeed—at least the impulse 
was—whether the act was entirely defensible or not. 
Had deceased any religious convictions ? 
That is to say, 
did he feel a 
dependence upon, or acknowledge allegiance 
to a 
higher power ?" 
More reflection. 
"I reckon you've stumped me again, pard. 
Could you 
say it over once more, and say it slow ?" 
" 
Well, to simplify it soniewhat, was he, or rather, had 
he ever been connected with any organization sequestered 
from secular concerns and devoted to self-sacrifice in the 
interests of morality ?" 
" 
All down but nine—set 'em up on the other alley, 
pard." 
" 
What did I 
understand you to say ?" 
"Why, you're most too many for me, you know. 
When you get in with your left I 
hunt grass every time. 
Every time you draw, you fill ; but I 
don't seem to have 
any luck. 
Let's have a 
new deal."

BUCK FANSHAW'S FUNERAL.—Continued. 
" 
How ? 
Begin again ?" 
" 
That's it." 
" 
Very well. 
Was he a 
good man, and—" 
" 
There—I 
see that ; don't put up another chip till I 
look at my hand. A good man says you ? 
Pard, it ain't 
no name for it. 
He was the best man that ever—pard, 
you would have doted on that man. 
He could lam any 
galoot of his inches in America. 
It was him that put 
down the riot last election before it got a 
start ; and 
everybody said that he was the only man that could have 
done it. 
He waltzed in with a 
trumpet in one hand and 
a 
spanner in the other, and sent fourteen men home on a 
shutter in less than three minutes. 
He had that riot all 
broke up and prevented nice before anybody had a 
chance to strike a 
blow. 
He was always for peace, and 
he would hare peace—lie could not stand disturbances. 
Pard, he was a 
great loss to this town. 
It would please 
the boys if you would chip in something like that and do 
him justice. 
Here once when the Micks got to throwing 
stones through the Methodist Sunday-school windows, 
Buck Fanshaw, all of his own notion, shut up his saloon, 
and took a 
couple of six-shooters and mounted guard 
over the Sunday-school. 
Says he, 
Irish need apply.' 
And they didn't. 
He was the bulliest man in the moun-
tains, pard ; he could rim faster, jump higher, hit harder, 
and hold more tangle- foot whiskey without spilling it 
than any man in seventeen counties. 
Put that in, pard ; 
it'll please the boys more than anything you could say. 
And you can say, pard. that he never shook his mother." 
" 
Never shook his mother ?" 
" 
That's it—any of the boys will tell you so." 
" 
Well, but why sholddhe shake her ?" 
" 
That's what I 
say—but some people does." 
" 
Not people of any repute ?" 
" 
Well, some that averages pretty so-so."

BUCK FANSHAW'S FUNERAL.—Concluded. 
"In my opinion, a 
man that would offer personal vio-
lence to his mother, ought to—" 
" 
Cheese it, pard ; you've banked your ball clean out-
side the string. 
What I 
was a-drivin' at was that he 
never throwed of on his mother—don't you see ? 
No 
indeedy ! 
He give her a 
house to live in, and town lots, 
and plenty of money ; and he looked after her and took 
care of her all the time ; and when she was down with 
the small-pox, I'm cuss'd if he didn't set up nights and 
nuss her himself ! 
Beg your pardon for saying it, but it 
hopped out too quick for yours truly. 
You've treated 
me like a 
gentleman, and I 
ain't the man to hurt your 
feelings intentional. 
I think you're white. 
I 
think 
you're a 
square man, parch. 
I 
like you, and I'll lick any 
man that don't. 
I'll lick him until he can't tell himself 
from a 
last year's corpse ! 
Put it there !" 
[Another fraternal handshake—and exit.] 
The obsequies were all that " the boys " could desire. 
Such funend pomp had never been seen in Virginia. 
The 
plumed hearse, the dirge-breathing brass bands, the 
closed marts of business, the flags drooping at half-mast, 
the long plodding procession of uniformed secret socie-
ties, military battalions and fire companies, draped en-
gines, carriages of officials and citizens in vehicles and on 
foot, attracted multitudes of spectators to the sidewalks, 
roofs and windows ; and for years afterward, the degree 
of grandeur attained by any civic display was determined 
by comparison to Buck Faushaw's funeral.

OH! one evening lately, I 
dressed up nately, 
I 
put on my Sunday clothes, plug hat and all, 
And I 
started prouclly, while whistling loudly, 
For Neal Brogan's raffle at Hibernian Hall. 
Going round a 
corner a 
gang of rowdies— 
Oh ! I 
know they're rowdies, for they never work--
Says, let us give this old Tad a 
racket, 
We will have a 
picnic, boys, and, toss the Turk. 
CHORUS. 
Now I'm not a 
fighter, nor yet a 
biter, 
But when duty call's I 
never shirk ; 
So I 
tell you plainly, tho' I 
look ungainly, 
That they had no picnic when they toss'd the Turk. 
Oh ! the big ringleader, a 
free lunch raider, 
Says, " O'Brien, you had better paint the 
tile,' 
Put crape around it, get an axe and pound it !" 
And he thought ' twas funny when the gang did smile. 
It was then my dander rose like a 
gander, 
For I 
heard one loafer say he'd flash a 
dirk ; 
So I 
ta.pp'd him lightly, and surprised him quitely, 
And they had no picnic when they toss'd the Turk. 
Now I'm not a 
fighter, etc. 
Oh ! they gather'd round me, and thought to pound me, 
But I 
put my back against a 
big brick wall ; 
' 
You can't go behind me," says 1, " now mind me, 
If we stand forninst me I 
can bate ye all. 
Then the (Yang did face me, and thought to lace me, 
But I 
sl7ow'd them tricks I 
learned at Donegal ; 
Right and left I 
pounded, they were dumbfounded, 
And at last for ineccy they began to bawl. 
SroKEx.----Well. they looked surprised, and Redheaded 
Mike says, " Who are you ?" " Well," says I, " my name 
is Cornelius Thomas Francis Meagher O'Brien, and more-
over—"

OUR marriage bells are ringing, 
What a

The present hour is bringing 
Sweet joy and ecstasy ; 
For she whom I 
have loved so long, 
Loved dearly as my life, 
Will give me ere the hour has gone, 
The right to call her wife, my wife, my wife. 
CHORUS. 
Our marriage bells are ringing, 
What a 
glorious peal to me, 
The present hour is brimming o'er 
With joy and ecstasy. 
Come, my darling, come and haste to me, 
Do not tarry, love, I 
wait for thee. 
Dost thou hear the wedding bells ? 
Joyous peals they ring for thee ; 
What welcome sounds their music tells--
I 
fondly wait for thee. 
What care I 
for the world's frowns, 
With the loved one by my side ? 
For through its ups and downs 
We'll breast life's stormy tide; 
And though the current bears as on 
From all that's bright in life, 
My love will ever be as strong 
As when I 
card her wife, my wife, my wife.

MANY CAN HELP ONE. 
As sung by TONY PASTOR. 
SOME very good sayings I've heard in my time, 
And some I 
heave to be true; 
The one I 
will mention to-night in my song 
Is one that is well known to you; 
If you meet a 
man who is down in the world, 
And assistance you can't give him ally, 
Remember that many can always help one, 
Where one cannot always help many. 
CHORUS. 
Then give what you can to those in distress, 
Let it be a 
dime or a 
penny, 
For many can help one, I've heard people say, 
Where one cannot always help many. 
How often a 
trifle would save a 
man's life 
When he is near dying from want ; 
He's tried to live honest all through his lifetime, 
But finds in the end that he can't ; 
At last he is tempted to steal or to starve, 
His rich friends they all pass him by, 
They heed not his wishes, they care not his wants, 
He's left like a 
dog there to die. 
Then give what you can, etc. 
A 
man may be wealthy one end of the year, 
The next one be wretched and poor ; 
He's struggled his hardest to keep himself up, 
But has sunk down to poverty's door ; 
Such men as, these deserve your support, 
So give it to them who most need, 
For those who've experienced poverty know 
'Tis a 
very hard battle indeed. 
Then give what you can, etc. 
I 
hope what I've mentioned to-night in my song, 
That nothing I've said out of place ; 
A 
man may be poor, but still holiest be. 
For poverty, ' tis no disgrace ; 
Then give what you can with a 
generous heart, 
No knowing when the tide it may turn ; 
Just give him a 
chance to rise up in the world, 
And your kindness he's sure to return. 
Then give what you can, etc.

HOPE I 
DON'T INTRUDE. 
Written and composed by W. H. DELEHANTY, and sung by DELBaiNTT 
and H ENGLER. 
I'M happy as the day is long, 
My mind is never easy, 
No matter whether right or wrong, 
You must not think me rude ; 
For love, it is the burden of my song, 
With joy I'm almost crazy, 
And if perchance I 
sing or dance, 
You must not think me rude. 
And if perchance I 
sing or dance, 
I 
hope I 
don't intrude. 
CHORUS . 
Oh, dear, don't you wish that you were me? (Symph.) 
I 
feel just as happy as a 
big bumble bee; 
(Symph.) 
I 
was walking by your door, 
When I 
heard the music sweet, 
My heart with joy filled over, 
And I 
couldn't keep my feet. 
So keep the music ringing, 
As it makes me feel so good; 
And if I 
make one little break, 
You must not think me rude. 
And if I 
make one little break, 
I 
hope I 
don't intrude. 
At a 
fancy ball the other night, 
Myself and little Daisy, 
We kept it up till broad daylight, 
We felt so awful good; 
And Daisy looked so fair and bright 
She set the men all crazy, 
And when they'd ask her for to dance, 
She'd say, " I 
wish I 
could," 
Then I 
would say, in a 
careless way, 
I 
hope I 
don't intrude. 
Oh, dear, don't you wish, etc. 
Oh, the happy day is drawing near 
When I 
shall wed my Daisy, 
1The summer time, when all is fair, 
And fiowrets scent the wood; 
When the merry birds are singing clear, 
My mind will then be easy ; 
In happiness and perfect bliss, 
I 
shall not then act rude, 
And if you come to see our home, 
We'll say " You don't intrude." 
Oh, dear, don't you wish, etc.

Price 40 cents. 
W HEN I'm dead and gone from you, darling, 
When I'm laid away in my grave, 
When my spirit has gone to heaven above, 
To Him who my soul will save ; 
When you are happy and gay once more,. 
Thinking of days that have been ; 
This one little wish I 
ask of you— 
See that my grave's kept green. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, the days will come to you, darling, 
When on earth no more I'll be seen ; 
One sweet little wish, darling, grant me--
See that my grave's kept green. 
Though the hours of joy now are passing. 
Yet how soon, alas I 
they will fade ; 
Though your glances of love are meeting my own, 
Fair sunlight will turn to shade ; 
When from the world and its hopes I 
go, 
Leaving forever this scene, 
Though others are dear, ah, will you then 
See that my grave's kept green ? 
Oh, the days, etc,. 
Will you keep me, love, in remembrance, 
Though the voice of chiding be heard ? 
And while others may speak in censure or blame„ 
let breathe no unkindly word ; 
Tell me you'll think of the happy past, 
Think of the joys we have seen ; 
This one little promise keep for me— 
See that my grave's kept green. 
Oh, the days, eta,

YOU'VE heard aboud a 
gal I 
loy'd, 
Dot used to be so stout 
How she " shook me" und just because 
I 
vould not take her out 
To balls und parties mid all dot, 
Vich I 
dought vas a 
sin ; 
But now I've got a 
new sweetheart, 
Und she is awful thin. 
CHORUS . 
She is so thin, dot vere she here, 
You could not see her; don't dot seem queer 
Bad luck have I—oh, I 
shall die; 
My vife is so awfully thin. 
Vero I 
first met dis female straw, 
'Dwas at a 
coundry fair, 
She vos valking long mit her mamma, 
Und had such nice blonde hair ; 
I 
spoke to her, she spoke to me, 
Ye got acquainted den; 
Ye married vere, und after dot 
She commenced to grow thin. 
SPOKEN.—She is the thinnfft of the thin; she used to vork 
an insdrument factory, cleaning out flutes ; I 
used to play 
"Hide mid Seek " mit her, und she used to hide in de gas 
pipe. 
I 
took her oud riding vonce, und I 
grabbed her instead 
of de whip ; I 
never took her mid after dot. 
I 
vos valtzing 
mit her at a 
ball vonce, und de floor manager come up und 
said, " Young man, you viii have to leave your cane in de hat 
room, it's not allowed on de floor !" I 
told him ' twas no cane, 
but my vife. 
De oder day vile ve vos owl calking, I 
saw a 
man 
selling leetle red balloons for ten cends; I 
bought vone, und 
give it to her to hold— she vent up, balloon mid all; I 
haven't 
leen her since, but 
She is so thin, etc.

THEY ALI , DO I. 
As sung by To: 
PASTOR. 
Soitac folks will cry, " Oh, shame, Mr. Jones, you are to 
blame; 
I 
never should have thought it, sir, of you ;" 
While if they'd look at home, before abroad they'd roam, 
I'm positive they'd have enough to do. 
Mr. Brown says it's a 
sin that Mr. Smith drinks gin, 
And harbors all the gang from day to day; 
When Mr. Green was caught doing what he didn't ought. 
When he in self-defence was heard to say— 
cHonts. 
They all do it, they all do it, 
They all do it, though oft-times they rue it ; 
Yet they all do it, they all do it, 
And so it will continue to the end. of the world. 
For hours three or four lovers spooning at the door 
On any pleasant morning may be seen ; 
And if they have a 
kiss ' twill never come amiss, 
And they enjoy it, though they say they didn't mean ; 
When creeping down the stairs comes the old man un-
awares, 
And kissing catches the couple in the act, 
The mother from above says, " Don't interfere, my love, 
You can't dispute this most important fact—" 
They all do it, etc. 
Old women do declare girls should never dye their hair, 
And then again they say it's very nice, 
Without the least restraint, their faces so to paint, 
And rob the eats and dogs of all their mice ; 
(1) 
THEY ALL DO IT.—Concluded. 
Each girl a 
little " puff" has inside a 
seal-skin muff, 
They are never seen without it, night or day; 
And her " turnup" nose she'll powder, if a 
moment is 
allowed her, 
When, if you laugh, she'll innocently say— 
They all do it, etc. 
But what does most impress is the style in which they 
dress; 
It's enough to make you laugh when them you see ; 
They've a 
hat upon their heads large enough to make up 
beds 
For " pussy " cats with kittens two or three ; 
In their paniers too behind, if examined, you will find 
The most important papers of the day; 
The " Clipper," if you chose, the " Herald," and the 
"News," 
Or anything that chance puts in their way. 
They all do it, etc. 
There's my neighbor, Mrs. West, who's expensive in her 
dress, 
And her husband only gets nine dollars every week; 
I've often heard him say, " If things go on this way, 
We'll a 
lodging in the station have to seek, 
For the doctor and the nurse will drain my scanty purse, 
With many more expenses to defray ; 
Then he gets into a 
passion when they tell him it's the 
fashion, 
And they soothe him when they sing this truthful lay— 
For they all do it, etc.

THE theatre was full, it was Dorkins' night, 
That is, Dorkins was going to appear 
At night in a 
favorite comedy part, 
For he was comedian here. 
Funny ? why, he'd make you laugh 
Till the tears ran down your face like rain, 
And as long as Dorkins was on the stage 
You'd try to stop laughing in vain. 
A 
family ? yes, he'd a 
family, 
And he loved them as dear as life, 
And you'd scarcely find a 
happier lot 
Than Dorkins' -children and wife. 
And you'd scarcely find a 
happier lot 
Than Dorkins' children and wife. 
There came one night, 
And I 
was in front, 
And Dorkins was going to play 
A 
character new to himself and the stage 
That he'd trod for so many a 
day. 
By eight the theatre was perfectly crammed, 
All awaited a 
pleasant surprise, 
For they knew they would laugh 
Till their sides would ache, 
And they longed for the curtain to rise. 
The play soon began ; 
Each neck was stretched forth, 
And eagerly watched each eye 
For Dorkins to make 
His " first entrance," and then 
To give him a 
cheerful " Hi, hi r 
(

DORKINS' NIGTIT.—Concluded. 
He soon appeared 
Amid loud applause, 
But something was wrong 
You could see. 
" 
Dorkins is playing 
Quite badly to-night," 
The people said sitting round me. 
A 
hiss ? yes, it was. 
I 
saw Dorkins start 
As though stung by a 
serpent's fang; 
Then he'd cast a 
beseeching glance all around, 
And his head on his breast would hang. 
He's drunk, and really 
I 
thought so myself. 
For to me it was awful at times 
To see how he'd stcuggle 
Along with his part, 
And continually stick in his lines. 
The footlights at last 
He approached very slow, 
And, " Ladies and gentlemen," said, 
" 
If I 
cannot please you to-night, 
The fault's not the heart, 
But the head. 
There's many a 
night 
I've made you all laugh 
When so ill I 
could scarcely 
Well stand, 
And every effort was pain to me then, 
Yes, if even I 
raised but my hand. 
You hiss me to-night, 
And think that I'm drunk 
(From his heart came a 
sob and a 
moan) ; 
I'll tell you the reason— 
I 
know you won't laugh— 
I've a 
little one dying at home.",

She looked just like an elephant, she had such a

'NEATH THE MAPLE BY THE MILL. 
Sang by R. 
G. 
LITTLE. 
W
ERE the moon is softly beaming 
O'er the cabin and the wildwood, 
And the birds have gone to rest among the trees; 
Where the sturdy woodman's stroke 
Has ceased to echo through the forest, 
And the milkmaid's songs come floating on the breeze. 
When the old church bell is chiming 
The soft hour of evening prayer, 
I 
shall look for your light footsteps down the hill ; 
I 
shall be impatient, Nellie, 
Till I 
hear your steps beside me, 
And we're sitting ' neath the maple by the mill. 
I'm sitting by a 
little mound, 
Beneath the maple shadow, 
Where it's leafy branches o'er me gently wave ; 
There beside me sleeps the treasure, 
While the sweetest autumn flowers. 
Are all blooming in sweet fragrance o'er her grPN•e. 
When the wintry winds are sighing, 
Among the leafless forest trees, 
And the flowers lying withered cold and still, 
I 
shall bid farewell to earth, 
Could I 
sleep beside my darling, 
In the grave 'neath the maple by the mill.

"ROCK OF AGES ." 
" 
ROCK_ of ages, cleft for me," 
Thoughtlessly the maiden sung ; 
Fell the words unconsciously 
From her girlish, gleeful tongue ; 
Sang as little children sing ; 
Sang as sing the birds in June ; 
Fell the words like light leaves down 
On the current of the tune— 
" 
Rock of ages, cleft for me, 
Let me hide myself in Thee." 
" 
Let me hide myself in Thee,"— 
Felt' her soul no need to hide— 
Sweet the song as song could be, 
And she had no thought beside ; 
All the words unheedingly 
Fell from lips untouched by care, 
Dreaming not that they might be 
On some other lips a 
prayer— 
" 
Rock of ages, cleft for me, 
Let me hide myself in Thee." 
" 
Rock of ages, cleft for me."— 
'Twas a 
woman sung them now. 
Pleadingly and prayerfully. 
Every word her heart did know. 
Rose the song as storm- tossed bird 
Beats with weary wing the air, 
Every note with sorrow stirred, 
Every syllable a 
prayer— 
" 
Rock of ages, cleft for me, 
It me hide myself in Thee," 
(1) 
6-3 
"ROCK OF AGES."—Coneluded. 
"Rock of ages, cleft for me,"— 
Lips grown aged sung the hymn 
Trustingly and tenderly, 
Voice grown weak and eyes grown dim— 
" 
Let me hide myself in Thee," 
Trembling though the voice and low, 
Ran the sweet strain peacefully, 
Like a 
river in its flow; 
Sang as only they can sing 
Who life's thorny path have prest; 
Sang as only they can sing 
Who behold the promised rest— 
" 
Rock of ages, cleft for me, 
Let me hide myself in Thee." 
"Rock of ages, cleft for me,"— 
Sung above a 
coffin lid ;— 
Underneath, all restfully, 
All life's joys and sorrows hid; 
Nevermore, 0 
storm- tossed soul I 
Nevermore from wind or tide, 
Nevermore from billow's roll 
Wilt thou need thyself to hide. 
Could the sightless, sunken eyes, 
Closed beneath the soft gray hair, 
Could the mute and stiffened lips 
Move again in pleading prayer, 
Still, aye, still, the words would be,— 
" 
Let me hide myself in Thee."

THE APOLOGY TO O'REILLY. 
NOT a 
hundred yards from where I 
stand, 
In this our glorious -Union land, 
Is kept a 
first-class liquor stand 
By a 
man whose name's O'Connor. 
There's a 
man who's known both near and far, 
Who attends to Mike O'Connor's bar; 
Who, in our late war received no scar, 
And his name it is O'Reilly. 
Beneath our banner's starry wave, 
There's not a 
man fought half so brave, 
Or half the money for whiskey gave, 
As did McDermott. 
O'Connor's bar-room blazed with light 
On that eventful, bloody night 
That McDermott had the fearful fight 
With O'Reilly. 
With sleeves rblled up McDermott stood, 
And vowed he'd die before he would 
Say the slightest word that could, 
In any manner, be misconstrued 
Into an apology to O'Reilly. 
With a 
frowning brow and flashing eye, 
O'Reilly collared a 
glass of rye, 
Which he devoured without a 
sigh, 
Then turning to McDermott, said, 
" 
You alchoholic vat, you drunken loon ! 
You've no more sense than a 
gossoon I" 
"Be Heavens ! 
I'll make you change your tune," 
Says McDermott. 
McDermott went for O'Reilly's nose, 
And on it planted fearful blows, 
Till o'er his eye a 
shanty rose, 
Erected by McDermott. 
O'Reilly fell into a 
swoon, 
With his head jammed in a 
big spIttoon, 
And dreaming of Barnum's big balloon, 
The poline came in and collared the gang.

IRT. 
COKE to me closer, my darling, look once upon me again; 
Speak to me fondly and truly, tell me the cause of your pain; 
Did I 
speak thoughtless or chiding, did I 
your heart ever 
grieve I 
Don't keep the truth from me hiding—kiss me, and say you'll 
forgive, oh, forgive. 
No one but what have their failings, try to forgive and forget; 
And if you'll love me as ever, life will have charms for me yet; 
Say then again that you love me, never shall change while wa„„ 
live ; 
Just once again tell me, darling—kiss me, and say you'll forgive, 
oh, forgive. 
Ah, tell- tale smile, I'm forgiven; now are my troubles all o'er, 
Like Cupid's arrow it's driven thro' to my heart's very core ; 
Smiles breaking from you, my darling, thus ever smile while 
we live; 
Remember to err Is but human, so kiss rue, and say you'll for-
give, oh, forgive.

Demperance is an old und veil corn subject, but like a

Id's very hard to approach a

"

I 
HAVE a darling whom I 
adore! 
When he is near I'm sighing no more; 
Lone are the hours when we are apart, 
Fondly his image now dwells in my heart ; 
Sweet hours of gladness we pass side by side, 
Waiting the day when I'll be his bride ; 
Dearly he loves me, but never in vain, 
Soon he is coming to kiss me again. 
CHORUS. 
Kiss me again, and say that you love me, 
Ever my darling remain ; 
Kiss me again, and if I 
complain, 
Say that you love me, and kiss me again. 
Sweet is the kiss that lovers can share, 
How it will cheer you and banish all care; 
Never refuse one, never be shy, 
Don't be too bashful, and scream out, " Oh, my !" 
Kisses are plenty, and kisses are sweet; 
When you take one the dose you'll repeat ; 
If with your loved one you'd always remain, 
Come to his side and say, " Kiss me again 1" 
Kiss me again, etc.

Of bus'ness we had a 
great sight, love ; 
Don't think for a 
moment I'm tight, love, 
I've only been down to the Club. 
My boots I 
left down in the hall, 
And softly I 
crept up the stairs ; 
I 
kept rather close to the wall, 
And thought to ascend unawares; 
But just as I 
got to the door, 
I 
seemed to get lost in the dark 
I 
stumbled and fell on the floor, 
And just then I 
could only remark— 
The " Club" had, etc. 
She sobbed and she wept and she screamed, 
And said she'd go back to her ma; 
While I 
on the mantel- piece leaned, 
And tried to enjoy my cigar. 
I 
promised to buy her a 
dress 
If she'd let me alone for awhile ; 
Then 1 
gave her a 
sweet little kiss, 
And I 
saw her beginning to smile. 
SPOKEN.— S0 
I thought it a 
favorable opportunity to assure 
her once more, as a 
positive fact, that— 
The " Club" had, etc.

rick's Day, 
With fifes and drums a- playing martial airs, 
From Ulster, Munster, Connainara, you see we are on hand, 
To march with tlie music to the tune of the Branigau's Band; 
Oh ! we march so gayly down the street, 
And ev'ry one we meet says, don't they step it neat! 
We smile on all the girls we meet, 
While marching down behind the famous Brauigan's Band. 
Mark time, keep step, forward, march away ! 
With eyes out, toes in, march in grand array I 
Shoulder arms, with head erect, together hand in hand, 
Like heroes bold the young and old wil.) march with the Brani-
gan's Band. 
The chambermaids in the big hotels, 1
1 y raise the windeys 
F3r handkerchiefs they're waving towels to catch our soldiers' 
eyes ; 
They've left their hash to come out and azash when the mar-
shal (Jives command ; 
Then we all raise our hats to the tune of thr Branigan's Band; 
Oh ! don't their hearts go pit- a- pat, 
As each one lifts Ids hat, the lean as well as tirt, 
Says, there's my Dan, there goes my Pat, 
Ile's the Daisy swell that's with the famous Evenigan's Band. 
Mark time, etc. 
Oh, we had a 
ball in Emerald Hall, and an illegant ‘ tipuer, too ; 
There was beans and peas and frigazees, and oysters fat for you, 
With pickled stews, and hullaboloos, and Irish quail so Jeand ; 
Beets, and cheese, and some potheen for the boys of the Brani-
gan's Band. 
Oh ! it's then we satin., 
and danc'd a 
reel, 
And oh ! how good we feel, we make the ladies squeal, 
So when morning comes it's home we steal, 
With the boys all drunk as lords, with the Branigan's Band. 
Mark time, etc.
