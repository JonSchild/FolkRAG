Words and Music by BONNIE B UNNELL& Sung with great success 
-: 
0 : 
You talk about your drummers— 
Ve're der finest in der corps— 
Ye 
our dime in sixdy-nine, 
In de Franco-Prussian War; 
Are got medals froin King William, 
Vhich we justly do deserve, 
For drumming in dat army, yes, 
And displaying spunk and nerve. 
CHORUS: 
For ven you see us brave huzzars, 
Our helmets shine, just like der stars, 
Our noble flag shows many a 
scar, 
For we are known as der brave huzzars. 
De Americans love der nation, 
And der Germans, too, der same, 
For fighting for our liberty, 
Dat is our greatest fame; 
Yen ye meet oder regiments, 
No jealousy we show, 
Ye lend a 
helping hand to all, 
No matter high or low.

JANE RILEY'S ALWAYS DRY. 
Composed by EDWIN TALBOT. Sung by BONNIE RUNNELLS. 
Air—John Riley's Always Dry. 
I 
have a 
fine old woman, Jane Riley, don't you see, 
I 
strike her with a 
feather, this Jancy she loves me; 
Her throat is like a 
fountain, her honor she won't cry, 
But, you know, hiding all her faults, Jane Riley's 
always dry. 
CHORUS: 
Ginger ale, very stale, 
She would order my Danny to go out and 'gay; 
I'm very stout, she would shout, 
I'll keep drinking rock and rye. 
Claret wine, gin so fine, 
She would land down the kettle on the table and cry 
My son Dan, fill the can, 
Her honor, Jane Riley's Dry. 
It's only very lately Jane Riley's nose got red, 
Sure neither paint or whitewash would whiten Janey's 
head. 
It's when I'm only rising, scarce opening my eye, 
I 
catch her sending out the boy, Jane Riley's always 
dry. 
Her mother often told me, when I 
was young and gay, 
The only thing to keep her still, was to let her have 
her way; 
You see I'm nearly looney, just look you in my eye, 
'us a 
big drop of the cratur, Jane Riley's always dry.

Political Senator. 
Written expressly for BONNIE RUNNELLS by EDWIN TALBOT. 
Here I 
am, a 
broken-hearted Dutchman, 
I'm right here, don't want an introduction, 
To tell about my troubles and my wages at reduction, 
And the army of starvation is at hand. 
I 
came to New York a 
few years ago, 
And worked in a 
steamship as anchor down below. 
I 
escaped cheese and hard-tack, I'll have you all to know 
That a 
Political Senator I 
will be though Dutch. 
CHORUS. 
Then give three cheers for the happy German race, 
They will stick to their country and never cause disgrace. 
The honest-hearted German can meet you face to face, 
There the candidates were wanting in our land. 
Ladies and gendlemens, don't be too sympathetic. 
Remember that the Germans are Republican and Democratic. 
Send your husbands out, oh ladies do now, don't forget it, 
To vote for General Dutchy, he's on hand. 
He vorks all day, and he never gets a 
cent, 
And this year we hope to the White House he'll be sent. 
Let him live on wind and cheese, of course he is content, 
The Political German Senator of the day. 
Then give three cheers, Fce.

POOR WHITE SLAVE. 
By HARRY BURNS. 
AIR— Slavery Days. 
TOILING slowly, day by day, 'till his life ha S 
pass'd away, 
And they give him scarcely room to lay his head; 
He drudges, morn and night, to earn his scanty bite; 
All his luxuries are water, scorn and bread. 
They never sing his praise ' cept on election days; 
And they often call him scoundrel, tramp or knave; 
All the world may keep him down with many a 
sullen frown— 
He is nothing only a 
poor white slave. 
CHORUS. 
No matter where it be still he never can be free; 
The poor will ever have to stoop and crave. 
His coat is ragged, tore, let us kick him from the door— 
He is nothing only a 
poor white slave. 
Great Beecher tells the poor they are well enough, he's sure, 
If they get but bread and water all the while. 
If ever there is a 
hell they'll chuck him in pell mell ; 
He will surely get the middle of the pile. 
‘Ve never look for joy, there's none for you or I; 
Still how our suffering hearts try to be brave; 
How it makes the tear-drops fall when they tell us after all 
We are nothing only a 
poor white slave. 
No matter where it be, etc. 
Those with riches hold full sway for their millions gaineth day; 
It has been our valiant legislator's boast, 
The slaves may put me in, but I'm sure ' twill be no sin, 
To always work for those who pay thE most; 
Vet, still we can forgive, 'tis only while we live, 
When this mortal life 
passing at the grave; 
Then well surely bless the day we so often heard them say 
He is nothing only a 
poor white slave. 
- 
matter where it be, etc.

THE WATERMILL. 
As recited by Gus IVILLIAms, at the Olympic Theatre. 
Listen to the watermill, through the livelong day, 
How the clicking of its wheel wears the hours away, 
Languidly the autumn wind stirs the greenwood leaves, 
From the fields the reapers sing, binding up the sheaves; 
And a 
proverb haunts my mind, as a 
spell is cast— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Autumn winds revive no more leaves that once are shed, 
And he sickle cannot reap corn once gathered; 
And the rippling stream flows on, tranquil, deep and still, 
Never gliding back again to the watermill. 
Truly speaks the proverb old, with a 
meaning vast— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Take the lesson to thyself, loving -heart and true, 
Golden years are fleeting by, youth is passing, too; 
Learn to make the most of life, lose no happy day, 
Time will never bring thee back chances swept away. 
Leave no tender word unsaid, love, while love shall last— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Work while yet the daylight shines, man of strength and will, 
sever does the streamlet glide useless by the mill; 
Wait not till to- morrow's sun beams upon the way, 
All that thou canst call thine own lies in thy— to- day, 
Power, intellect and health may not always last--
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Oh the wasted hours of life that have drifted by, 
Oh! the good we might have done, lost without a 
sigh! 
Love that we might once have saved by a 
single word, 
Thoughts conceived, but never penned, perishing unheard, 
Take the proverb to thine heart, take and hold it fast— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Oh I 
love thy God and fellow-man, thyself consider last, 
For come it will, when thou must scan dark errors of the past; 
And when the fight of life is o'er, and earth recedes from view, 
And Heaven in all its glory shines, 'midst the pure, the good 
the true. 
Then you'll see more clearly the proverb deep and vast— 
The milt win never grind with the water that is past,

NEVER GIVE WAY TO SORROW, 
Written by JOHN WALsn, and sung with great success 
all over the world. 
0 
Many a 
man grows tired and weary, 
As he toils life's road along; 
Everything looks dark and dreary, 
All he does seems to go wrong; 
Yet, I 
say, never be despairing, 
Fortune yet may smile some day; 
And her gifts with you be sharing, 
So remember what I 
say. 
CHORUS: 
Never, boys, give way to sorrow, 
Sighing only is in vain; 
For the sun will shine to-morrow, 
And the grass will grow again. 
Though false friends should all forsake you, 
Laugh their dirty trick to scorn; 
Luck some day may overtake you, 
When you look the most forlorn; 
Troubles in this world are plenty, 
Few from them are always free; 
Though your pockets should be empty, 
Still take this advice from me. (Chorus),

Want all the children for to follow me; 
So don't forget to curl your hair, 
Halle, halle, halle. hallelujah!

Parody on Leaving the Old Folks. 
Written by BILLY LESTER, and sung by PAUL ALLEN, Esq. 
I 
am leaving now the Poor-House, to go I 
know not 
where, 
I 
am leaving it in sorrow and disgust; 
I've eight million in my pocket I 
stole from Viola 
Clifton, 
To try and get a 
date I 
know I 
must; 
I've a 
pocketful of gags and encores I 
bought from 
Sarah Bernhardt, 
I've been a 
tramp for over seven years; 
I 
could start a 
penny lodging house under the Fifth 
Avenue Hotel, 
And let people sleep in the drums of my ears. 
0101t136: 
Then I 
am leaving now the Poor-House, I 
am trans-
ferred to the Coliseum, 
For trying to guy a 
couple of musical mokes; 
If I 
catch Niles & Evans stealing Eddie Booth's 
Dialect, 
I'll make them a 
present of John T. Kelly's jokes. 
Adam and Eve, From Lum and Bud Granger were 
with a 
fly by night, 
They played to eighty cents in Kankakee; 
They done a 
nice big four act with the Arnold 
Brothers from Texas, 
And statue essence with the J 
called Andy McKee 
Hyde & Behman done a 
waltz-jig along with Billy 
Emmet, 
Poor Paul Allen couldn't dance, his foot was sore; 
But yet he is a 
darling, he is mashed on Charlotte 
Banks, 
He is the pretty boy that came from Baltimore.

Where was Solomon Isaacs when the 
Loafers Stole the Geese. 
Written and sung by DAVE H OWARD. 
I'm a 
quiet Hebrew man, 
My business I 
know well, 
And if you wait a 
little while 
My troubles I 
will tell. 
It's about a 
gang that hangs around, 
And me they always teaze; 
And if I 
only turn my head 
From the cellar they steal my geese, 
CHORUS. 
Where was Solomon Isaacs when the loafers stole thA geese? 
Where was Solomon Isaacs when the loafers stole thQ geese? 
What was he about when they cracked him in the snout ? 
Where was Solomon Isaacs when the loafers stole the geeae? 
They kicked me all around the place, 
Until my head was sore; 
They wasn't satisfied with that, 
They want to give me more. 
My wife went almost crazy then 
From hollering out " Police ! 
There goes a 
gang of robbers there, 
They stole my husband's geese I" 
Where was Solomon Isaacs, &c. 
To the court next day I 
went, 
My wife Rachel and I. 
The judge says " What's your business here. 
What makes that woman cry?" 
I 
said, Oh, judge, good Mr. Judge, 
Just listen if you please: 
A 
gang of giraffes hangs round my store, 
And they always steel my geese." 
Where was Solomon Isaacs, &c.

BEETS AND POTATOES. 
As sung by the German Cotnique, Bonnie Ronn#24. 
Now, young gentlemen and ladieg, 
Workingmen and little babies, 
Something funny I

Something I

Here you see a 
poor y:-)ung German, 
And my name it is Fritz-Herman, 
Here I

As the people all pass by; 
You're always sure to hear me cry: 
CHORUS. 
Beets, potatoes by the dozen, 
For your uncle and your Cousin,

And other things which was immense, 
Here's a

A 
receipt for blowing bladders, 
All the lot I'll give to you 
For only seven cents. 
When its cold, I'm always freezing, 
Selling things is very teasing, 
When it rains I'm always wet, 
I

My wile, she does always grumble, 
Tells me to go take a 
tumble, 
If I

The people all do laugh at me 
When I

DON'T LEAVE GRANDMOTHER; NOW 
SHE'S OLD. 
COMPANION TO GRANDFATHER'S OLD ARM- CHAIR. 
Music Published by W HITE, SMITH & Co., Boston, Mass. 
Price, 35 cents. 
Sung by J. W. GRIFFEN, with fourteen encores. 
The white apple blossoms are falling in showers, 
The rose bushes bloom in the sweet summer air; 
Enjoying the calm of the bright sunny hours, 
Grandmothsr sits in her old easy-chair. 
She reads in her Bible of cities fair, 
Whose walls are of jasper and gold, 
And waits for the angels to carry her there— 
Don't leave poor Grandmother, now she is old 
CHORUS. 
Don't leave poor grandmother, now she's old, 
White silver locks now have displaced the gold. 
Don't leave poor grandmother, now she's old, 
White silvered locks have now displaced the gold. 
Ah! well we remember when poor mother died, 
They laid her to rest where the green willows wave, 
How grandmother comforted us when we cried, 
Tenderly led us away from the grave. 
How patient, and gentle, and kind she's been, 
Her love for us ne'er can be told ; 
Oh, may her life's evening be calm and serene, 
Don't leave poor grandmother, now she is old. 
Don't leave, etc. 
The old village school-house that stands on the hill, 
The quiet village churchyard where tall grasses grow; 
The swift running stream near the old water mill, 
Bring back the mem'ries of long, long ago. 
These may be forgotten, but grandmother's care, 
Her tenderness, richer than gold, 
Shall ne'er be forgotten, our home she shall share, 
We'll not leave grandmother, now she is old.

Pull Yourselves Together, Boys. 
Originally sung by Miss ELLA. WEssEst. 
We're all of us bothered sometime in our lives, 
By something that's sure to go wrong, 
With us our children, our sweethearts and wivec 
As life's road we journey along. 
That troubles are hard I 
confess, at the time, 
Though afterwards they appear small ; 
And I 
will endeavor to show in my rhyme, 
A 
way to get over them all. 
SPOKEN. — And that is to— 
C 
HOR 
US. 
Pull yourselves together, boys, 
Pull yourselves together, 
Never mind the knock down blows, 
But pull yourselves together. 
'Tis nice when your cupboard is scanty and bare; 
To have hungry visitors call, 
And say they've popp'd in your small dinner to share. 
But hope you won't mind them at all ; 
The last bob has vanished for victuals and drink, 
And so has your credit as well ; 
You treat them as friends, but in frenzy you think, 
That it is a 
terrible sell. 
Si.ox-EN.—Still. nevertheless 1 
you must— 
Pull vourselvcs„ &a. 
'Tie nice when you borrow and pay interest large, 
To be just a 
little behind; 
And go home and find broker's men are in charge, 
And taking your goods—never mind— 
Your furniture, worth more than treble your debt, 
Is seized by these scoundrels, but they 
Will find to their cost there are Magistrates yet, 
Who'll make the rogues heavily pay. 
Pull yourselves, &e.. 
It's rapture when out until three or 'till four, 
*Unknown to your wife, on the spree, 
To find that the chain is put up on. the door, 
And you have forgotten the key. 
It's nice when you serve on a 
jury, to find, 
Your tailor sits next door but one, 
And he is a 
Claimant, but law! never mind, 
All trials will some day be done. 
SPOKEN. — And until life's little trials are over you must—

Where Was Mickey When The 
Gas Went Out? 
Written and sung by HARRY CLARKE, Irish and Character Vocalist. 
My name is Michael Dugan, I 
live down in Water street, 
I'm bothered by the boys all round, who call me Mike 
the beat, 
if I 
go to get a 
glass of grog they're sure to follow me in, 
I 
try to drink, the gas goes out, and then they steal my 
gin, and then they all holler— 
Cnonus. 
Where was Mickey when the gas went out ? 
Where was Mickey, what was he about ? 
If we had him here we'd stuff him full of bees, 
Where was Mickey when the gas went out ? 
I 
went and I 
got married, sure I 
thought I 
would be all 
right, 
The boys would bother me no more, I'd keep out of their 
sight, 
But I 
was going down street next day when the gang 
snatched me like mad, 
I 
had to fill them up with booze they felt so very glad. 
(67writs.) 
Xow I 
have got four fine big boys, they look just like 
their daddy, 
There's John and James and little Mike, of course there's 
one named Paddy, 
Now Paddy is the smartest boy the neighbors ever seen, 
And when they ask him anything they find he isn't green. 
CHORUS. 
Where was Paddy when the gas went out ? 
Where was Paddy, what was he about, 
If he wasn't there he wasn't anywhere, 
Where was Paddy when the gas went out ? 
WHAT I 
LOVE. 
Written by JAMES SAN FORD. 
Sung by SANFORD & W ILSON with great success, 
I 
love my breakfast in the morning, 
I 
love my dinner at night; 
I 
love to hear original songs, 
I'd sooner eat than fight; 
I 
love to have plenty of money, 
I 
love my little wife, 
I 
love to smoke Havana cigars, 
But the best I 
love is life; 
I 
love to play in J. Towns, 
Make a 
failure among the gawks; 
I 
love to drink sparkling champagne, 
But I 
don't love long walks.

But I

WARRIOR BORN SONS OF ERIN. 
Written and composed by HARRY W HALING, Vocal Comedian and 
Author, at TONY PASTOR'S THEATRE, N. 
Y. 
- : 0 :— 
Of the Great men of Ireland, I've often sung, 
And boasted her soldiers in war; 
But I'll now change the subject, and raise here to-night. 
The warrior born true Irish Tar; 
No nation in this world more sturdier Jacks 
Ever had than the boys from our land; 
For in foul or in fair, when wanted they're there, 
At their post, boys, they ever will stand. 
CHORUS: 
Able and willing to do and die, 
Ever there when wanted, never known to fly; 
To uphold their Country's honor against the world 
you may rely, 
Will the Warrior born Sons of Erin. 
Though blue are the clothes in which I 
now dress, 
The green shamrock's dearest to me; • 
And the man too must tight, who before me dare slight, 
That dear little Isle in the sea; 
'Tis the land I 
was born in, and though far away, 
If on me she ever should call; 
For my Country's good in warfare I 
should, 
Be prepared lads to conquer or fall. 
(Chorus). 
The old Union Jack knows an Irishman's worth, 
For he's oft proved her best friend at sea; 
While the brave stars and stripes, gladly gives him 
birth, 
And a 
home hi the land of the free; 
There's Irish descent in the Fleet of proud France, 
In fact I 
should like to know where 
Is the Country can show better seamen than Pat, 
Or whose Sons can do more than we dare.

What Are You Up To, Jane? 
Sung by the Great Motto Vocalist, EDWIN BARRY, at Harrigan 6. 
Theatre Comique, Broadway. 
Mother Jones kept a 
snug I
-OLe grocery 3tore. 
Mother Jones was obnoxious and plain, 
Mother Jones had a 
daughter both pleasing and fair, 
Whose sweet appelation was Jane. 
While the old one was serving tobacco or gin, 
I'd court pretty Jane on the sly, 
And oh, what sweet, glorious moments we'd have, 
Until the old woman would cry— 
CHORUS. 
What are you up to, Jane ? 
What are you up to, Jane? 
I 
never knew such a 
girl in my life, you're up to your mis-
chief again, 
What are you up to, Jane? now what you up to, Jane ? 
I 
never knew such a 
girl in my life, you're up to your mis-
chief again. 
One day I 
said, Jane, would you like to be married? 
I 
fancy I 
should, said she, 
So one fine morning we bolted away, 
And got married upon the " Q. T." 
We went down to Rockaway, as Jane preferred 
The seaside for the honeymoon tour, 
Out at night we'd a 
fright as I 
rat out the light, 
A 
knock came at the bedroom door. 
SPOKEN.—And a 
voice through the key-hole said— 
What are you up to, Jane ? &c. 
Mother Jones was too late, for the bridal knot 
Was safely and securely tied, 
For ten years more from my mother-in-law, 
I 
kept at a 
distance wide. 
But she turned up again a 
few days ago, 
When we startled the old 'uns curls, 
With a 
great surprise for her dear old eyes, 
When we mustered the boys and girls. 
SPOKEN.—As our " blessings " came into the room two, 
by-two, like a 
healthy boarding-school, the " old 'un 
dropped 
gracefully into the nearest coal scuttle, exclaiming— 
WI, 
a 'ire you up to Jane? &c.

There are songs unsung in ev'ry heart, 
Some beautiful memory hidden, 
That nestles alone in its resting place, 
By sorrow and tear-drops hidden, 
Some sad, sad hope that once did bloom, 
When life was gay and young, 
But now it is faded, and withered, and dead. 
Oh ! beautiful songs unsung. 
CHORUS— 
Beautiful songs unsung, 
Sorrowful songs unsung, 
Oh ! nestle alone in thy secret place, 
Oh! sorrowful songs unsung. 
There are songs unsung, there are tales untold, 
Whose memory never can perish, 
For the hearts that know them are hearts of gold, 
And they keep them to love and to cherish. 
Tho' some are sombre and sad and drear, 
To the lives of the saddened they're clung, 
They are set in tears and never can die, 
Oh ! sorrowful songs unsung, 
Beautiful songs unsung, & t, 
There are songs unsung, there are words of love. 
That in kindness and truth were spoken, 
But now are the links of a 
glad, wild dream, 
Cherished and loved, yet broken. 
And, oh! to the heart that knows them so well, 
They've the sweetest of thoughts among. 
For they seem like a 
life that was kissed by death, 
Oh ! sorrowful sungs unsung.

Put a 
Headstone O'er Poor Mother's Grave, 
Written by W ILLIAM SCANLAN. 
Oh, Willie, dear Willie, our mother is dead, 
Our mother whom we loved so dear; 
She's sleeping to-night in her cold, cold grave, 
No more will she be with us here. 
How happy we were when by the fireside. 
With mother we'd sit all alone; 
And what stories she'd tell to both you and I, 
•Tant now she has left our dear home. 
Yes, mother has gone to Heaven above, 
And there's one thing of you I 
would crave; 
As children should do for a 
mother so true— 
Put a 
headstone o'er her beloved grave. 
How often, when sickness irept us in our beds, 
Not a 
friend in the world could we find 
Half so good as our mother, who'd sit by our side, 
And to us be so gentle and kind. 
Yes, morning and night, she'd watch our sick brows, 
Never thinking of rest; 
But-now she has left us aloio bele to weep, 
And gone to the land of the blest. 
Yes, mother has gone, etc. 
THE WINNER IN THE 
Written and sung with success by FRANK LEWIS at Buckingham 
Theatre, Louisville, Ky., and at Harry Miner's Theatre, N. Y. 
As new songs are all the rage, on the street and on the stage, 
There is many a 
glorious maxim you will find; 
But there's one more than the rest, seems to linger in my 
breast, 
And often it comes stealing o'er my mind; 
So this advice I'll give you all to-night, 
Endeavor to look manly, strong and bright; 
Love your neighbor as you ought, and when life's battle's 
fought, 
You'll find you'll be the winner in the end. 
They are killing Kings and Queens, and tramping down 
the green, 
In Europe all the Monarchs feel afraid; 
That the people they will fight, and stand up for their rights 
And on the great nobility they'll raid; 
But why don't they come here, where men can live, 
Where freedom unto all we freely give; 
' Where the whole world finds a 
home, leaves Kings unto 
their doom, 
Uncle Sam is always winner in the end. 
• 
In the papers we oft read, of peculiar things, indeed, 
And many changes that we see in life; 
It is custom in this land, for each and every man, 
To take unto himself a 
little wife; 
If there's any lately married here to-night, 
May your fireside be always cosy, bright; 
And if in your future days, a 
flock of boys you try to raise 
I 
hope you'll come out winner in the end. 
About every week or so, we have walking matches, true, 
And one city patronizes them quite free; 
How each pedestrian tries, to gam the given prize, 
And sometimes they succeed most manfully; 
There's Hughes who made the best recorded time, 
And others have shown a 
record fine; 
But what seems to me so queer, when Rowell does walk herq 
We never come out winner in the end.

Quiet Little Home.

Hart's Theatre Comique, Broadway,. 
by EDWIN BARRY. 
I 
lead a 
very homely life in a 
quiet sort of way, 
I 
like well to enjoy, and not feel over gay; 
Fast life does not agree with me at any time or place, 
I've traveled nearly through this world at quite a 
quiet pace. 
CHORUS. 
A 
quiet little home in a 
quiet little way, 
A 
quiet little wife sitting quiet all the day, 
A 
quiet little parlor, a 
quiet cup of tea, 
A 
life of peace and quietness. that's the life for me. 
X 
like to have my social sing, I 
like my pipe and glass, 
love my wife. I 
love my friends with whom the time to pass 
A 
reasonable hour to rest, an early hour to rise, 
'Twill make a 
man both healthy, wealthy, prosperous and wise. 
A 
quiet little home, &c. 
So now, my friends, take my advice, and do the best you call 
To earn a 
name that will become an honest working man; 
Study the comforts of your home, and very soon you'll find 
life of peace and quietness is best suited to the mind. 
A 
quiet little home, &c,

Oh I

That bright dream was too beautiful to last 
And we'll meet as only strangers, 
In the future evermore, 
Our once tender love is buried in triv past. 
Tho' I've tried to bear the blow, 
Without sighs or bitter tears, 
And tried to smile when my heart ached with pain. 
Yet the burning tears would fall, 
In spite of all that I 
could do, 
For the darling one I 
ne'er shall see again. 
CHORUS.

Ohl they say you love another, 
Who has claimed you for his bride, 
And you wish me to forgive and to forget; 
All the vows we pledged together, 
By the rippling of the tide, 
As I 
looked into your beauteous eyes—my pet. 
Ali I 
the heart is like the tides, 
That flow and ebb at will, 
I 
would not cease to love thee if I 
could; 
So, thro' all the future years, 
love thee fondly, dearly, darling! 
For I 
could not cease to love thee if I 
would. 
My dream of love is o'er, lee.

Parody on Scotch Lassie Jean.. 
I 
once knew a 
maiden who in New York did dwell, 
She was ugly and cranky all the time; 
She was struck on a 
baker and a 
dizzy undertaker, 
And a 
butcher in Cincinnati over the Rhine; 
One night the butcher called with a 
couple of pork 
chops, 
His love he tried to explain; 
lie gave her a 
squeeze, and off came his nose, 
From the breath of this Scotch Terrier Jane. 
CHORUS: 
Oh, Jane, Oh, Jane, I've got you on the brain, 
You have no reason to explain; 
Your teeth they are false, from taking epsom salts, 
You're my liver-lip Scotch Terrier Jane. 
(Repeat). 
She's lovely and fair, and her feet they were bare, 
Her bustle it stuck out twenty feet; 
One day in the house she happened to eat a 
mouse, 
It gave all her lovers a 
treat; 
The butcher and the baker, and the dizzy undertaker, 
They went crazy when they all heard the news; 
I 
often heard them say, when she was put away, 
She died from hoisting Mott St. Booze. 
CHORUS: 
Oh, Jane, Oh, Jane, my club-footed Jane, 
With tears I 
have cause to explain; 
You're a 
daisy that was lazy, your lips they were greasy, 
You're my sweet-scented Scotch Terrier Jane. 
(Repeat). 
You Were False, But I'll Forgive You. 
Sung with immense success by Miss George Melnotte 
the Queen Serio-Comique. 
Fare thee well, for once I 
loved you, 
Even more than tongue can tell, 
Little did I 
think you'd leave me, 
Now I 
bid you all farewell. 
You have wrecked the heart I 
cherished, 
You have doomed me day by day, 
You are false but I'll forgive you, 
But forget you I 
never may. 
- [Repeat last two lines.] 
When I 
saw your eyes in virtue, 
I 
could scarce believe my own, 
When I 
heard your voice in anger, 
It was death to every tone. 
They have told you some false stories, 
And you believed them all they say, 
You are false but I'll forgive you, 
But forget you I 
never may. 
[Repeat last two lines.] 
One more word and all is over, 
Why are you unkind to me? 
Tell me why you do not love me, 
Turn aside how can it be ? 
No word not one word of pleasure, 
You believe them all they say, 
You are false but I'll forgive you, 
But forget you I 
never may.

Every joy it will enhance, 
Thro' the spell of witchery, 
Come, love, waltz with me, 
Waltz with me, love with me, 
Hand in hand our dance shall be, 
Pleasure's brimming cup we'll drain, 
While it holds its joyful reign, 
In your arms circling round, 
Love's sweet mystery may be found, 
Dance of Cupid may it be, 
Come, love, waltz with me.

WHEN I 
CATCH A 
POLITICAL SNAP. 
Written, Composed and Sung by MASTER ROBERTS, America's 
Wonder, Comedian and Vocalist. 
Arrah my name is Jeremiah McMahon, 
I've two sons, Tommy and Dan; 
One is running for Sing Sing, 
The other for Congressman; 
I 
work on the river inspecting fog, 
My wife for me does fret; 
But if my son Tom is elected, 
I'll be in Washington bottling heat. 
CHORUS: 
I'll buy my wife a 
new calico dress, 
A 
rag baby to dance on her lap; 
I'll drink nothing but Champagne and Ink, 
When I 
catch a 
Political snap. 
I'll move into an Irish flat, 
I'll have oil paintings in the alley; 
I'll try and get some Senator 
For to marry my daughter Sally; 
I'll put all my friends a 
cleaning sewers, 
Or in some office of Rank; 
When my term is up I'll bet I'll own 
Two gold mines and a

I'm bothered, yes, I'm bothered, 
Completely perplexed; 
I'm the father of a 
little poy, 
I'm not happy, but Pm vexed. 
I 
have ninety-nine relations, 
And they nearly drive me wild, 
Both one and all, both great and small, 
They want to name the child. 
CHORUS. 
My wife she said it'll be Michael, 
Her sister said it'll be Matt, 
Her brother said it'll be Charlie, 
Whilst her aunt said no, it'll be Pat. 
Whilst my mother wants him Shamus' 
And my father wants him Paul, 
By heavens sure I 
don't know what 
I'll call the child at all.

T'was only here this morning, 
My brother came from Troy, 
He swore by this, he swore by that, 
That he would name the boy. 
Says my wife's brother Darby, 
He be hanged if that would do, 
And they jumped together on the floor, 
And had a 
bold set-too. 
Next Sunday is the Christening, 
And I 
tell you by the way, 
I'll have none of their connivings, 
Pm bound to have my say. 
They may call him this, and call him that, 
I 
don't give that, for their call, 
I'm bound to call him Dennis, 
Or he'll have no name at all. 
CHORUS. 
My wife may want him Michael, 
Her sister may want him Matt, 
My brother he may want him Charlie, 
Whilst her aunt may want him Pat. 
Whilst my mother wants him Shamus, 
And my father wants him Paul, 
Pin bound to call him Dennis, 
Or he'll have no name at all.

When the daisie's dot the meadow 
Shall we, dearest, meet again, 
Will the summer zephyrs kiss us 
When we wander down the lane ? 
Long ago we met and parted 
In the golden pastures bright, 
And since then my little darling 
Time has quickly taken flight. 
In the soft fie. 
When in Heaven with the Angels 
Shall we, dearest, meet again, 
Will we climb the hill together 
To the land that knows no pain? 
In that home no wail of sorrow 
Breaks the pure and loving heart, 
And I 
hope my little darling 
There we'll meet to never part.

Composed by Rollin Howard. 
The evening breeze is ebbing low 
A 
lullaby to-clay 
I 
have a 
quest4on I 
would ask 
Before it dies away. 
The pebbles on the beach are dry 
The tide has sunken low; 
A 
little form is standing near 
Between the ebb and flow. 
CHORUS. 
She's just a 
roguish little dear, 
And it was not very late 
As she whispered " yes !" and shed a 
tent, 
As we parted at the gate. 
A 
little heart that longing waits 
To know what next ' twill hear, 
A 
little face that shyly looks 
To see if still I'm near. 
Ah 1 
little heart that whispered, " Yes," 
Though pouting lips said, " No," 
You thought that you'd be asked again 
Between the ebb and flow. 
A 
little face half frightened when 
I 
turn to go away, 
Two little hands that shyly reach 
As if to bid me stay; 
A 
little voice that softly says, 
I 
did not mean that " No;" 
A. little pride that well was lost 
"Between the ebb and flow."

I 
often met her after, 
Down by that running stream, 
And oh! such tales of love 
I'd tell to my young lovely queen, 
On every moonlight evening, 
For a 
promenade we'd go, 
And oh! the happy nights we spent, 
Where the water lilies grow.

For we both intend to go

There's sixteen dacent families 
In the house where I 
reside; 
On summer nights to cheer ourselves 
All pleasures we have tried, 
But. on the roof it's best of all, 
To hear us would be proof, 
We make the neighborhood resound, 
All singing on the roof. 
CHORUS: 
Singing on the roof, the boys and girls together. 
We play the concertina, likewise the sweet banjo, 
The Murphys and O'Neils come up to see the weather, 
We're highly elevated until we go below. 
Now up comes Mistress Hoolahan, 
With the baby in her arms, 
With pleasant conversation then, 
Sure every one she charms. 
There's Rosy Dunn and Reiley's son, 
And a 
Russian named O'Goofe, 
With voices loud, they join the crowd, 
All singing on the roof. 
Singing, etc 
Young Roger Flynn got up to dance, 
With a 
lady from next door, 
" 
Come welt the tin," says Roger Flynn, 
"It's like a 
ball-room floor." 
Then one by one they joined the fun, 
Sure, none could hold aloof, 
It was a 
sight that summer night, 
To see them on the roof. 
Singing, etc. 
Now that's the place to spend the night, 
And feel that pleasant breeze, 
Take up your pipe and stretch yourself 
In an attitude of ease. 
The boys and girls will gather round, 
And fill the air with glee, 
When singing on the roof at night, 
As happy as can be.

Written for LARRY TOOLEY by D ICK ANDERSON. 
I 
vonce did love a 
pooty gal, 
Her name was Lena Vhite, 
Und to her father's house I 
called 
To see her efery night. 
She vas so shy, und so vas I, 
From each odder ye vould run, 
So I 
took a 
note und den I 
wrote 
A letter to der Sun. 
CHORUS. 
I 
says, " Now, Mr. Paper, 
I'm a 
poor heart-broken man; 
I 
vant a 
gal to marry me, 
But I 
don't can ask her hand. 
I 
vould thank you for to tell me 
Just how der ding is done, 
I'll look me for an answer 
Next Sunday in der Sun." 
Next Sunday den der answer came, 
Und it read just like dis: 
" 
Now Mr. Krouse, you tell us 
Dot you vant a 
vife or twenty. 
Ve tell you just for fun— 
Move to Salt Lake—or to Brooklyn," 
Said dot letter in der Sun.

says, Now, & c., 
Composed by HARRY BElorErr, and sung with success by BILI3 
CARTER. 
Oh, love is such a 
very funny thing, 
And it catches the young and the old, 
It's just like a 
plate of boarding-house hash, 
And many a 
man it has sold. 
It makes you feel like a 
fresh water eel, 
And causes your head to swell. 
You lose your mind, for love is blind, 
And it empties your pocket-book as well. 
Boys keep away from the gals, I 
say, 
Give them lots of room, 
Or you'll find when you're wed, 
They will bang you till you're dead, 
With bald-headed end of a 
broom. 
When man is gone on a 
pretty little gal, 
He talks just as gentle as a 
dove; 
He spends all his money, and calls her his honey, 
For to show her he is solid on his love. 
When his money is gone and his clothes in hock, 
He finds the old saying it is true, 
That a 
mole on the arm is worth two on the leg, 
But what is he going for to do. 
, Boys keep away, eta, 
When married folks have lots of cash, 
Their love is firm and strong, 
But when they have to feed on hash 
Their love don't last so long. 
With a 
wife and seventeen half-starved kids, 
I 
tell you its no fun. 
When your butcher comes around to collect his bill, 
With a 
dog and double barrel gun. 
Boys keep away, etc. 
Young fellows just take my advice, 
Don't be in a 
hurry for to wed, 
You think you're in clover till the honey- moon's over, 
And then you'll think you're dead. 
With a 
cross-eyed baby on each knee, 
And a 
wife with a 
plaster on her nose, 
Vas+11 find true love don't run so very smooth, 
When you have to wear your second-hand clothes. 
Boys keep away, eta. 
When the rent is high, and the kids all cry 
Because there's no grub to chaw, 
You'll holler for your son 
To load up your gun, 
While you vaccinate mother-in-law.

Pretty Little blue-Eyed Stranger.

Cincinnati, Ohio, 
Written, composed and sung by BOBBY NEWCOMBE, with great success. 
When the summer breeze was blowing 
O'er the land and far across the sea; 
I 
met a 
little blue-eyed stranger, 
As pretty as can be, 
Her dress the pink of neatness, 
Her walk the height of grace, 
Her smile the mould of sweetness, 
And such a 
handsome face. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! when the summer breeze was blowing, 
O'er the land and far across the sea, 
I 
met a 
little blue-eyed stranger, 
As pretty as can be. 
Wavy golden ringlets flowing 
To the breeze so merry, light and tree, 
That kissed the little blue-eyed stranger, 
As pretty as can be. 
Towards her I 
walked gaily, 
While waves rolled on the shore, 
I 
tried to speak, but vainly, 
I 
ne'er felt so before. 
Oh! when the summer, &c. 
The sequel to the story knowing, 
The end of course you'd like to hear from me; 
I've wed this little blue-eyed stranger, 
As pretty as can be. 
We're living in contentment 
Just down by the shore, 
And another little stranger 
Now plays around the door. 
Oh! when the summer, &c.

PARODY ON PITCHER OF BEER, 
As sung by HARRIGAN & HART in the Mulligan Guard's Picnic. 
Writsen by JAMES RICHMOND. 
I 
am a 
friend to the Millionaire, when he is drunk, 
Though from a 
Millionaire I 
am far away; 
My Pa he is rich, he owns a 
wood's and a 
ditch, 
And gets seventy-five cents every day. 
He spends money free for coffee and tea, 
And often it does turn his brain; 
To see himself drinking water because he is poor, 
And the rich drink from their bottle d champagne 
CHOltIIS: 
Then each week in the night, each year in the mon,h, 
It will snow, it will blow, or it will rain; 
While the rich is draining beer-kegs on some lonely street, 
While the poor man is drinking champagne. 
The poor go to Long Branch for the good of their ht,aiih 
The Herald and the Sun is the proof; 
They smoke $2.00 cigars, go in bathing in silks, 
While the rich have to sleep on the roof. 
Its a 
shame poor factory girls can't wear diamond ring. 
If she catches a 
mash at a 
ball, he is insane; 
He'll buy her a 
doughnut and a 
three cent lemonade, 
And imagine she is drinking champagne. 
CHORUS: 
Then take my advice, sleep on a 
cake of ice, 
If you're got a 
bad reputation, rub out the stain; 
The Queen of Cincinnati has to drink milk, 
While Dennis Kearney is drinking champagne,

Und a

Its moud looks like its mudder dear, 
Wich I

In honor of de child,

Written and sung by H ENRY CARNEY, with marked success at Tony Pas.. 
tor's Theatre, New York. 
You've all heard of the solid men, 
And men of great renown; 
But if you'll listen for awhile 
I'm certain you will own 
That I'm the most respected man 
In this great town; and why? 
It is because when I 
walk out 
You will hear the people cry— 
CHORUS. 
I'm Mr. Johnny Dougherty, the tailor 
A 
man of great renown; 
And everybody knows that to make a 
suit of clothes 
I'm the very best you'll find in all the town. 
I've heard them say a tailor is 
The ninth part of a man ; 
Let them get up and knock me 
Into nine parts if they can. 
Devil a 
one would ever dare 
To box me for a 
foe, 
For I 
can box as well as stitch. 
Ns very well they know. 
I'm Mr. Johnny Dougherty, 8ze. 
GIVE HIM ANOTHER CHANCE. 
THIS world's a 
cold and selfish one, 
As many tnousands know; 
Who once were blessed with hope and joy, 
But now are fallen low. 
Whose hearts were ever kind and warm, 
Nor turned from grief aside; 
But always lent a 
listening ear, 
When pain and sorrow sighed. 
Then let us aid their sad distress, 
For we like them perchance, 
May crave the favor of the world, 
To give us another chance. 
We cannot search their breaking hearts, 
To know the anguish there, 
But kindly acts may heal their smart. 
And soothe their sad despair, 
For many whom you meet to-day. 
In sorrow broken down 
Possesses hearts as kind and true, 
And noble as thine own. 
Then do not turn away from them, 
With cold and haughty glance, 
But lift your fallen brother up, 
And give him another chance. 
The riches of the world were made, 
Not for a 
selfish end; 
But that we generously might spare, 
Some, for a 
suffering friend, 
No matter what the faults may be. 
Concealed within his heart, 
To save the wretched erring one, 
Is a 
true and manly part: 
Then, when you see a 
fallen man, 
With sorrow in his glance, 
Don't crush him farther in the dust, 
But give him another chance.

OLD MAN CHARACTER SONG. 
Lord I am coming up to dis yah glory, 
To follow my Loved one's in the Sky; 
I 
am tired of the sin down below here, 
And I'll tell you the reason why. 
J 
am weak and weary, so sad and weary to- night,

And when the sun is setting way far beyond the mill 
I'll sing the old, old story, and climbing Zion's Hill. 
CHORUS: 
Den come this way children, 
I 
am on my journey home; 
Good-bye old Snow Drop Nancy, 
Farewell old Aunty Ohio. 
Jest hand the instrument down to me, 
I 
mean de old Banjo; 
And I 
will play my last farewell, 
Then Angels carry me home. 
Oh Lord let me Ile happy, let me walk the Golden Street, 
Where everything is lovely, and the Angels look so sweet; 
I 
want to be up higher, my mosso he's gone there, [ there. 
And though I'm old and feeble, I'll sing and dance when 
I'll send down blessed tidings when trouble you offends, 
At sunrise every morning, 
bread from heaven send; 
Then good-bye now I'm happy, good-bye, fare you well, 
I'm climbing up the ladder, and ringing Heaven's bell.

Coe .1. 
The Greatest Trick Book of the Age. 
IT PLEASES BOTH OLD AND YOUNG) 
Ft is a Fac simile of a Trick practiced by all 
the Professors of Magic. 
It is arranged so systematically, and is accom-
panied with directions so plainly written, that, with 
a 
single perusal, any person may become an adept 
in an unfailing source of amusement. 
Bead what a leading Journal says of it: 
" 
An ingenious little book of the thaumaturgic oral, 
has been sent us, called HUMPTY DIMIPTY,' and bound 
in such a 
way as to give opportunity for a 
decidedly 
puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary appear- • 
ance of a 
child's picture-book, gayly printed and colored, 
it is so bound that a 
practiced manipulator, taking it 
up, and flirting the leaves rapidly over, can make it ap-
pear to be filled with copies of only one picture, or with 
blank pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of 
figures. 
One minute the pamphlet, quickly thumbed, 
appears to contain nothing but portraits of Harlequin, 
in his tesselated suit; the next, only Columbine; then, 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or Mephisto-
pheles. 
A little practice, and the directions printed 
with the book will make anybody at,horae in the hand-
ling of it."—Phila. Evening Bulletin.'
