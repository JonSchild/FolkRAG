My Mother-in-Law
MY MOTHER-IN-LAW 4116 29A2
Mrs. Sullivan Shafter, 1940
Now friends if you'll listen I'll sing you a ditty Of the ugliest old woman That ever you saw.
She is so ugly She frightens the children When they go for a walk Out on the street.
With a hole in her head Like a crack in a punkin And a hump on her back And such very
large feet.
O my life is all trouble No pleasure I see Wherever I go That old lady watches me.
I'd rather be drug off To jail or to congress Then spend all my life with My mother-in-law.
I told that old lady When I married her daughter I didn't intend The whole family to wed.
Then quickly she picked up A bucket of water And taking good aim Let fly at my head.
O my life is all trouble No pleasure I see Wherever I go That old lady watches me.
