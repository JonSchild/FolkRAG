THE TRUE CROSS AND THE PSEUDO-EVENT: 
SOME REFLECTIONS AND READINGS ON THE COLUMBIAN QUINCENTENARY 
The Columbian Quincentenary in 1992 officially commemorates 
the day in 1492 when Christopher Columbus and his men waded 
ashore on the Bahamian island he named San Salvador, but if we 
were to consider the anniversary in its fullest significance a 
much better mark might be that day in April of the following year 
when Columbus presented himself and his American trophies before 
the Catholic Kings of Spain in the city of Barcelona. 
Surely 
this was one of the greatest scenes in human history: 
part Roman 
triumph, part medieval pageant, above all a supreme moment of 
personal vindication for Columbus, but poignant also because we 
know that this moment would turn out to be the pinnacle of his 
glory, that hereafter in his lifetime his triumph would turn to 
frustration, disappointment, and decline. 
Delacroix painted the Triumph of Columbus in jewel-like 
colors, with the Admiral in gold, the monarchs bedecked and 
bejeweled, their dais canopied and carpeted by cloths of velvety 
red and blue. 
At Columbus' side the artist placed his American 
treasures, the objects making a rather puny array at the foot of 
the thrones, while his human trophies -- arrayed in the feathered 
headgear that would remain for centuries the symbol of the 
American native -- display an attitude at once submissive and 
dignified. 
The painting was one of a pair commissioned by a 
2 
Russian nobleman to hang in an Italian villa he had recently 
purchased near Florence. 
The other is painted in somber and 
contemplative tones and shows the visionary Columbus at the 
outset of his quest, portraying his arrival at the monastery of 
La Rabida near Palos, where he would find shelter for his young 
son Diego and influential support for his quest in the court of 
Queen Isabella. 
Neither painting reflects a meticulous concern 
for historical accuracy: 
The massing of figures in the Triumph 
is modeled on Titian, and the city portrayed in the background 
looks more like Florence than Barcelona. 
Similarly, the 
monastery portrayed is not the Franciscan La Rabida but is based 
on Dominican and Cistercian monasteries that Delacroix visited in 
other parts of Spain. 
But both pictures are faithful to their 
inspirational source, the romantic image of Columbus as a lonely 
and heroic individual presented in the famous biography published 
in 1828 by the American writer Washington Irving.
1 
It thus seems 
fitting that both paintings now hang in American museums, one in 
Washington, the other in Toledo, Ohio for despite their European 
provenance both reflect the American impact on Columbus's 
reputation and on the meaning of his life and deeds for the 
people of the United States.

The Delacroix paintings and numerous others like them are 
some of the things that people will get to see with fresh eyes 
during the Quincentenary in an exhibition that will explain how 
and why Christopher Columbus got to be an American hero. 
There 
will be numerous other exhibitions of art, at least two new 
operas, probably a hundred or more conferences, and all manner of 
other worthy endeavors inspired by the Quincentenary. 
Why then are we approaching this occasion with such 
disquiet? 
The reason, in my opinion, is that we lack a 
collective certainty about the significance of the anniversary 
and of the appropriateness of the ways that have been proposed to 
mark it. 
During my term at the Jubilee Commission, we developed 
a certain shorthand around the office to deal with words that 
conveyed this unease. 
First, there is the 0-word, that awkward 
polysyllabic testimony to the unprecedented nature of a 500th 
anniversary of anything in the United States. 
Now that I have 
left the Commission, I can confess to being the culprit who 
dredged up this ungainly word from the Oxford Enqlish Dictionary. 
At the time (1983), I intended it for use only in the context of 
NEH, and hoped that the deliberate archaism embedded in the term 
"Columbian Quincentenary" might help to distinguish this 
anniversary from the recent rash of bicentennials and centennials 
whose excesses and disappointments still rankled among some of my 
colleagues. 
Little did I know that some staffer up on Capitol 
Hill would pick up on the 0-word and embed it in the federal law 
4 
creating a presidential Commission whose name I would spend part 
of my later life trying to explain. 
As for "jubilee," I have no 
idea where it might have come from, but to the staff's dismay it 
became the commission's shorthand name around Washington, if only 
because this was the only word in its name which the presidential 
commission does not share with the dozens of other public and 
private bodies which have sprung up to claim a share of the 
action in 1992. 
In any event, the 0-word -- once you master it -- doesn't 
mean anything else and is infinitely to be preferred to the more 
technically correct alternative, "cinquecentennial." 
But the D-
word ("discovery") and the E-word ("encounter") offer 
contradictory and controversial interpretations of what happened 
in 1492, with the further complication that the latter word 
implies that what happened was part of an historical process 
while the former reinforces the popular impression that Columbus' 
arrival at San Salvador was above all else a big event. 
Then 
there are the choice of C-words -- commemoration or celebration - 
- that define contrasting approaches to the observances. 
In 
fact, of the three words that people of my generation learned in 
school -- "Columbus discovered America" -- only one still has an 
unambiguous meaning and in Columbus, Ohio, where this essay 
originated in the form of a speech, even the meaning of 
"Columbus" is not always clear. 
5 
Once we have named the observance, there remains the 
question: 
why do it, whatever it is? 
What -- and whose --
purposes are served by staging an event such as the 
Quincentenary? 
There has already been one conference on this 
question, funded by the Florida Endowment for the Humanities and 
held in Saint Augustine in June 1987. 
I suspect that many of the 
participants in this conference will dine out comfortably on this 
question through 1992. 
I suspect, too, that they will find it 
difficult to arrive at any answer as appealing as the question 
itself. 
In fact, the answer to "why" depends very much on the 
"how" -- on the sorts of commemorative activities that are 
examined and on the symbolic and practical meanings ascribed to 
them. 
For example, no scholar to my knowledge has challenged the 
appropriateness and value of holding academic conferences on the 
Quincentenary -- I can plead guilty myself to having organized 
six so far and to having participated in at least six others. 
In 
fact, conferences are very much a part of the American Columbian 
tradition, if we count the gathering convened by the 
Massachusetts Historical Society to hear Jeremy Belknap's 
Columbus Day address in 1792 or the one hundred-plus convocations 
held in Chicago in 1893 in conjunction with the World's Columbian 
Exposition. 
However, there has been plenty of academic 
skepticism expressed about the value of other components of this 
tradition, such as the parades, statues, and ceremonies which are 
fixtures of the annual Columbus Day event in many cities and 
which seem likely to flourish even more abundantly in 1992. 
6 
Still there are practical answers available to the question 
of why do it. 
One of them has to do with programming within 
cultural institutions which regularly offer new programs to their 
publics. 
The observance of anniversaries is one of the major 
stimuli to such programs. 
Universities hold symposia, museums 
hold exhibitions, symphonies program concerts to mark the 
anniversaries of births and deaths of artists and composers and 
the foundation dates of institutions. 
In recent years, for 
example, we have had the 350th anniversary of Harvard, the Bach-
Handel-Scarlatti tercentenary, and the 70th birthday of Leonard 
Bernstein. 
All occasioned major cultural productions. 
Harvard 
alone spent more than $1,000,000 on its 1986 celebration. 
In 
1992, we will observe the centennials of Walt Whitman's death and 
Darius Milhaud's birth, both of whom wrote about Columbus but 
whose anniversaries would be observed that year in any event. 
It 
is also the centennial year of the University of Chicago. 
Plans 
for appropriate programming are already underway in all three 
cases. 
Observing the Columbian Quincentenary is part of this 
deeply-rooted cultural tradition. 
A second and related answer has to do with stocktaking. 
Just as individuals assess their life course at certain 
milestones, so do institutions and polities. 
The globalization 
of the world economy has stimulated such stocktaking in several 
cities, for example, who have chosen the milestone of 1992 as a 
benchmark against which to measure and improve their position in 
7 
the international economic order. 
This is happening in cities 
seemingly as different as Genoa, Liverpool, Seville, Baltimore, 
Chicago, Miami, and Columbus, Ohio. 
The appropriateness of the 
Quincentenary milestone seems obvious if we consider Columbus's 
voyage of 1492 as the first step -- tiny but irrevocable -- in 
the process of creating the net of modern global communications 
and resource flows in which even the most parochial communities 
today find themselves caught. 
The coincidental choice of 1992 by 
the European Economic Community as the target date for its 
elimination of internal trade barriers has reinforced the 
international significance of the quincentennial year. 
In using 1992 as an agenda- and goal-setting device, the 
interest of urban authorities and planners is fixed upon what are 
called "residuals" 
-- that is, on permanent benefits the 
creation of which is advanced by the quincentennial observance 
and which remain after 1992 as a permanent fixture in the city's 
array of economic and cultural resources. 
Usually residuals mean 
new facilities, but they can also be new capabilities and 
enhanced acceptance and visibility of the civic image which local 
authorities wish to broadcast to tourists and businessmen. 
The 
Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, created in 1894 to 
house the anthropological exhibits assembled for the world's fair 
of 1893, is an example of a residual from the fourth Columbian 
centennial, as was the transformation of the city's southern 
lakefront. 
Another residual was Chicago's reputation as the 
8 
second city and the urban embodiment of American progress. 
Contemporary Chicago business leaders sought to justify their 
plans for another world's fair in 1992 by offering another 
lakefront transformation and a grab bag of other residuals. 
This 
time they ran afoul of environmentalists, neighborhood activists, 
foreign rivals and just about everyone else, and so the idea of a 
Chicago World's Fair has been shelved. 
But a similar array of 
goals is being pursued by exposition planners in Genoa, Seville, 
and Columbus, Ohio, while Baltimore leaders have so far advanced 
an ambitious set of economic, educational and cultural programs 
across the urban political minefields that did in the Chicago 
fair. 
In Spain, the 1992 agenda is national in scope, with the 
Barcelona Olympics and the Seville World's Fair serving as only 
the most visible events in a complex and far reaching economic, 
cultural, political and diplomatic program. 
The Quincentenary 
has been called Spain's "coming out party," marking its emergence 
as a modern democracy and as a full partner in the European 
community. 2 
But Spanish authorities see this as also a time to 
reaffirm the Spanish past, at least those parts of it which are 
compatible with Spain's present-day hopes. 
Thus their 
quincentennial program includes a reassertion of Spain's cultural 
leadership of the Spanish-speaking world, the enhancement of the 
2 Wall Street Journal, October 27, 
1988. 
9 
international prestige of the country's revived and reformed 
monarchy, and the reclamation of historic but long-suppressed 
values such as religious toleration and the defense of human 
rights. 
The program also includes a determined attack on the 
anti-Spanish "black legend" of Anglo-American tradition, a 
tradition which has embedded the Protestant view of New World 
history in both the historiography and in the Columbian 
commemorative traditions of the United States. 
Nothing as comprehensive as the Spanish approach to 1992 has 
emerged in the United States, or indeed in any other country 
except perhaps the Dominican Republic, which has embarked on an 
ambitious program to commemorate its history as the "threshold" 
of European civilization in the Americas. 
Nevertheless, while 
the U.S. quincentenary may lack the integrated focus and 
comprehensiveness the Spanish and Dominicans seem to have 
achieved, 1992 will see a multiplicity of programs appropriate to 
the nation's diversity and to the scope of the event. 
From the 
standpoint of events planners who hoped that 1992 would lead to 
the kind of popular and commercial successes represented by 
precedents such as the Chicago fair of 1893 or the Statue of 
Liberty centennial of 1986, it is depressing to find the 
confident assertion that "Columbus discovered America" displaced 
by multiple theories of the Quincentenary's significance, by 
unresolved controversies such as the site of Columbus' first 
landing place or the actual design of his ships, and by intense 
10 
competition among ethnic groups and localities which wish to be 
the focus of the national commemoration. 
From the standpoint of 
humanities councils, on the other hand, these multiple 
uncertainties and controversies are grist to the humanities mill. 
The range of programming possibilities is very nearly endless, 
but there are guideposts which I have found useful in sorting 
through them. 
And so I offer these in the form of an annotated 
bibliography, a shelf of books that reveal the richness of the 
cultural and educational potential of 1992. 
The best place to begin is with Alfred W. Crosby's pamphlet, 
"The Columbian Voyages, the Columbian Exchange, and Their 
Histories." 3 
Developed as the first number in a new series of 
pamphlets on global and comparative history produced by the 
American Historical Association, Crosby's survey reviews the 
traditional historiography of Columbus and his voyages and sets 
it in the context of the challenges raised by contemporary 
historians. 
It is also a good introduction to the issues Crosby 
raises about the biological impact of 1492 which he discusses at 
greater length in his own unique and highly praised contributions 
to the literature, The Columbian Exchange 4 and Ecoloqical 
3 (Washington: 
American Historical Association, 1987).

Imperialism 5. 
Crosby's review of the historical literature can be 
supplemented by four important works by scholars from other 
disciplines. 
The anthropologist Eric Wolf confronts the 
Eurocentric bias in the traditional approach to New World history 
in Europe and the People without History. b 
In the comparative 
focus in which Wolf frames the ideology of European expansion 
into the lands across the seas, the traditional meaning of 
"discovery" inevitably gives way to the modern perspective of an 
"encounter." 
The geographer Donald Meinig offers a comparative 
perspective of a very different sort in his Atlantic America,  
1492-1800, 7 the first volume in a planned three-volume 
"geographical perspective on 500 years of history." 
Meinig's 
achievement is to integrate through geographical analysis the 
understanding of topics which are usually divided up along the 
boundaries of the competing European empires or emerging national 
states of the colonial Americas. 
His integrative foci are the 
requirements and achievements of ocean navigation and the 
European penetration of American coastlines between 1492 and

1800. 
Within this framework he offers persuasive answers to some 
classic questions of American historiography, such as why the 
Iberian kingdoms were better prepared to exploit the newly 
discovered lands, why the north Europeans lagged behind for two 
generations, or why African slavery in America -- a Luso-
Brazilian innovation -- had such a comparatively modest impact on 
Spanish America while expanding and intensifying later in 
colonies founded by the Dutch, English, and French. 
The deconstruction of the Eurocentric view is further 
advanced by the literary theorist Tsvetan Todorov's The Conquest 
of America. 8 
Todorov considers his book to be essentially an 
exploration of Europe's confrontation with "the Other," 
the 
American native cultures and environments for which no 
satisfactory explanation was available in Europe's authoritative 
pre-Columbian texts and beliefs. 
His close reading of the 
writings of Christopher Columbus and of Bernal Diaz and other 
chroniclers of the conquest of Mexico offers a fascinating 
depiction of how European perceptions of the peoples they found 
across the Atlantic were shaped by the conceptual framework they 
brought with them. 
Later chapters of the book are more 
interesting for the limitations they reveal about the 
deconstructive method than for the insights they offer into

13 
Spanish conquests after 1521. 
Todorov's reading of later and 
more abundant sources is essentially no more or less than the 
textual analysis historians have always used upon original 
sources, except that Todorov does not bother to locate his 
reading in either historiographical or archaeological contexts. 
The Italian economist Antonello Gerbi, exiled in Peru during 
World War II, began there to create an intellectual history very 
different from Todorov's -- a two-volume study of the impact of 
the Americas on the history of European thought. 
The second 
volume of this study, The Dispute of the New World, 9 is 
particularly useful. 
The debates Gerbi analyzes were in 
essential outline a continuation of the argument between Las 
Casas and Sepulveda about the nature of the American "other," but 
by the eighteenth century the argument had assumed a modern, 
proto-scientific form, framing questions about the comparative 
virtues of New and Old World biota, including humans, that 
engaged the attentions of thinkers as diverse as Voltaire, 
Jefferson, Hegel, Rousseau, Darwin and Lyall. 
The "rediscovery 
of America" that Gerbi portrays in the last half of the century 
is of special relevance to the Quincentenary because of three 
developments. 
The rediscovery rescued Christopher Columbus from 
relative obscurity and made him available as a symbolic national

founder to the poets and patriots of the first independent 
American nation, the United States. 
The expulsion of the Jesuits 
from the Spanish Empire in 1767 and the American Revolution a few 
years later confronted European thinkers with a generation of 
American-born scholars and propagandists, such as Jefferson and 
Franklin and the dozens of creole Jesuits who flooded into Italy 
after their deportation from Spanish America. 
This first 
generation of native-born Americanists challenged the negative 
writings of European philosophers about American peoples and 
resources (as, for example, Jefferson did in Notes on Virginia.) 
Finally, the Spanish Enlightenment through the creation of the 
Archives of the Indies and of Simancas and the encouragement of 
pioneer scholars such as Martin Fernandez de Navarrete provided 
the research materials for a vast expansion of knowledge about 
New World history. 
It is not surprising that the most extensive and influential 
early use of these resources was made by the American writer 
Washington Irving. 
The New England antiquarian and bibliophile 
Obadiah Rich lured Irving to Madrid in 1826, ostensibly to do a 
translation of Navarrete's five-volume collection of documents on 
the creation of the Spanish empire. 
Instead, as Rich had hoped, 
Irving wrote a biography of Columbus (1828),
10 which with his

Harman McElroy; Boston: 
Twayne Publishers, 1981). 
Vol. IX of The 
Complete Works of Washinqton Irvinq. 
15 
subsequent companion volumes on the Catholic kings and on other 
Spanish explorers, were the first comprehensive narratives of the 
Columbus era since the 16th century. 
Irving's writings were also 
among the founding works of American Hispanism and did much to 
establish the subjects of Columbus and of the Spanish New World 
empire as a principal theme of 19th century American 
historiography. 
If Washington Irving placed Columbus at the center of the 
American approach to New World history, no one has done a better 
job in keeping him there than Samuel Eliot Morison. 
His Admiral 
of the Ocean Sea ll is not likely to be replaced as the definitive 
Columbus biography of our generation. 
But the Italian scholar-
politician Paolo Emilio Taviani offers a useful and encyclopedic 
supplement to the Irving and Morison literary biographies in his 
Christopher Columbus: 
the Grand Design,
12 published in an 
awkward but adequate English translation in 1985. 
Taviani's most 
valuable service is to provide an informed assessment of the 
literature and sources on each of the questions which continue to 
generate heat and, occasionally, light among Columbus scholars 
and aficionados, questions such as: 
Was Columbus really the 
first to "discover" America? 
Was he really from Genoa? 
Was he 
really a Catholic (as opposed to a converso or converted Jew)? 
11 
(Boston: 
Little, Brown & Co., 1942). 
12 
(Translated from the Italian by William Weaver; London: 
Orbis Publishing Ltd., 1985). 
16 
Did he have secret knowledge of a Portuguese or some other "pre-
discovery" that occurred prior to 1492? 
Where did he get his 
geographical ideas? 
Who really financed his voyage? 
Who made up 
the crew and how were they assembled? 
Where precisely did he 
first land in the Bahamas? 
How did he find his way home so 
unerringly? 
And so on. 
As someone who regularly had to answer 
Columbus questions -- trivial and not so trivial -- from 
interested members of the public, I found Taviani's volume 
invaluable, though I would never recommended the English 
translation to someone in search of a good read. 
A leading 
Spanish scholar who regularly debates Taviani in international 
conferences admitted to me recently to using the book precisely 
as I do, as a reference work. 
It is one of the objectives of Spanish scholarship and of 
the Spanish national quincentenary commission to displace 
Columbus from the center of popular interest in the events of 
1492. 
This is an objective with which most American Hispanists 
are in accord. 
To understand why, read Herbert Eugene Bolton's 
classic The Spanish Borderlands.
13 
To the "Anglocentric" version 
of American history with its advance of Anglo-American 
institutions and English-speaking settlers westward across North 
America, Bolton juxtaposed an alternative frontier thesis -- a 
13The Spanish Borderlands: 
A_ Chronicle of Old Florida and the 
Southwest (New Haven: 
Yale University Press, 1921). 
Vol. 
XXIII 
of The Chronicles of America. 
17 
northward advancing frontier of people and institutions from the 
Spanish colonial empire which Columbus had helped to found. 
This 
is the one of the few of Bolton's many books to find a large 
readership, and that is due in large part to the literary efforts 
of an editor with whom the author fought bitterly. 
The secret of 
Bolton's influence is not so much in his ideas as it is in his 
success in diffusing them through graduate students whom he sent 
out from Berkeley to universities across the entire southern tier 
of the United States, the region which he called the Borderlands 
while it was turning into what we now call the Sunbelt. 
His 
biographer numbers Bolton's "academic progeny" at 108 Ph.D's and 
more than double that number of masters students.
t4 
This progeny 
has multiplied so much that it is possible today to encounter 
historians who describe themselves as fourth or fifth generation 
Boltonians. 
The departments which he colonized have also grown 
to accommodate three distinct fields of specialization that he 
and his early students once united in their work: 
Modern 
Boltonians can be Hispanists -- that is, historians of peninsular 
Spain and its institutions and culture; Latin Americanists, 
students of the Iberoamerican empires in the New World and their 
successor societies in Central and South America and the 
Caribbean; or Borderlanders, historians of the regions of the 
southeastern and southwestern United States which once formed

18 
part of Spanish America. 
Turf minding among these three fields 
helps to explain why it is sometimes difficult to obtain 
agreement on academic quincentenary agendas, but they are united 
in the pursuit of the goal that Bolton set -- to rescue the 
Spanish component of early American history and to bring it to 
its rightful share of scholarly and public attention. 
Or as the 
master himself put it, 
"[to prove] that there is something else 
to be said on the topic of American colonization besides Plymouth 
Rock, Pocahontas, and other time-honored stories." 15 
A Boltonian venturing out of the academy will quickly 
discover an ethnic dimension to the Quincentenary that has 
relatively little to do with the actual events and processes of 
colonial history but much to do with the popular understanding of 
what we will be commemorating in 1992. 
Columbus Day today is an 
Italian-American holiday and the parades, speeches and statues 
which are usually the focus of its celebration have a distinctly 
Italian-American cast. 
Hispanic citizens and scholarly 
Hispanists, Latin Americanists, and Borderlanders may be 
determined to change this, but the Columbian tradition has been 
in Italian-American hands for most of this century and it is not 
likely to give way simply on the basis of an expanded awareness 
of Spanish colonial history or of the potential influence of 
present-day Spanish-speaking voters and consumers. 
Contrary to 
15 ibid., 151. 
19 
what most people think, however, this ethnic component of the 
Columbian tradition is neither timeless or intractable. 
Christopher Columbus's incorporation into the origin myths of the 
American nation was a Yankee innovation, a product of the 
patriots of the early republic and of such prophets of romantic 
American individualism as Washington Irving and Walt Whitman. 
The greatest icons of this tradition -- John Vanderlyn's painting 
"The Landing of Columbus," Randolph Rogers' bronze Columbus Doors 
of the U.S. Capitol, and the Lorado Taft Columbus fountain in 
front of Union Station in Washington -- were likewise created by 
WASPs. 
When the fourth Columbian centennial was celebrated, the 
speeches were given by Yankee professors and orators and the 
buildings were festooned in the red and gold of Spain, not the 
red-white-and-green colors of the House of Savoy. 
Italian-
Americans made Columbus their hero and Columbus Day their holiday 
only after the Columbian tradition had been deeply rooted in the 
United States for more than a century. 
Because Columbus had 
already been so thoroughly Americanized, he naturally became an 
appealing symbol of patriotic identification for an immigrant 
community that was badly fragmented and under tremendous pressure 
during the decades following 1892. 
Werner Sollors wide-ranging and provocative book Beyond 
Ethnic ity 16 helps to explain this ethnic dimension. 
Sollors does

Consent and Descent in American Culture 
(New York: 
Oxford University Press, 1986). 
20 
not deal with the Quincentenary as such, but rather with the 
process by which the promoters of ethnic identification have 
enlarged the boundaries of consent within our pluralistic 
society. 
Definitions of ethnicity range between two polar 
extremes -- definitions based on descent, which embrace all 
members, and only members, of a group on the basis of parentage; 
and definitions based on consent, which provides means of 
voluntary adherence to group identity and is open to the 
possibility of assimilation and in fact may even foster it. 
Viewed in this light, the "Italianization" of the Columbian 
tradition in the United States was a strategy for enlarging the 
boundaries of consent for Italian-Americans. 
That is, it 
projected a middle way whereby immigrants and more particularly 
their descendants could simultaneously express their 
identification with their Italian heritage and with the larger 
society which had already made Columbus a national hero. 
The 
Italian Columbus Day is an expression of respect for American 
traditions and institutions, offered in exchange for the larger 
society's respect for the Italian ethnic heritage and pride. 
The 
Hispanic strategy of reclaiming Columbus Day in New York and 
other cities is in much the same vein. 
The danger that both 
groups face is that ethnic competition for dominance of the 
Columbian tradition will only serve to isolate that tradition 
from other Americans who do not belong to either group. 
A 
related danger is that in competing for control of a tradition 
that was defined primarily by Yankees to celebrate Euro-American 
21 
progress in 19th century America, Italian-Americans and Hispanics 
will risk confrontation with another ethnic group, Native 
Americans, many of whom are looking to the Quincentenary as an 
opportunity to reassert their own claims on the national past and 
on a special right to participate in the shaping of America's 
future. 
Finally, every quincentenary bookshelf should include Daniel 
Boorstin's The Image.

This is a recent reissue of an 
astonishingly prescient 1962 essay on the impact of mass media in 
American public life. 
According to Boorstin, the pseudo-event is 
arranged rather than spontaneous; it is designed to be reproduced 
-- that is to have its principal impact through reportage in the 
media rather than on the persons who happen to be present, even 
if they are present in large numbers; and the event in question 
has an ambiguous relation to reality, that is, to authenticity --
a pseudo-event can and probably should be staged, but it should 
not appear to be. 
The pseudo-event is a thoroughly modern 
phenomenon, Boorstin believes. 
In fact, as we approach the 
Quincentenary, there is something like a boom going on in what 
are called "special events, " which differ little in their 
essentials from the features that Boorstin described. 
The reason 
for the boom is that commercial sponsors of special events can 
target advertising dollars much more precisely to intended

America (25th 
anniversary edition; New York: 
Atheneum, 1987).

audiences than is usually the case with mass media. 
Thus beer 
makers sponsor sports events that attract audiences of young 
males, Cadillac and BMW sponsor polo matches, and banks or 
conglomerates who wish to enhance their prestige and reputation 
for civic virtue sponsor "blockbuster" art exhibits or ballet 
troupes. 
The Statue of Liberty Centennial demonstrated the 
commercial possibilities in historical commemorations, and even 
the Bicentennial of the U.S. Constitution -- considered alike by 
most scholars and most events producers to have been a flop --
stimulated a 67 per cent rise in tourism in Philadelphia. 
The 
Idaho and Washington State centennial commissions have raised at 
least $300,000 and $4,000,000, respectively, in commercial 
sponsorships for their planned 1989 activities.

With stats 
like these, can Columbus be far behind? 
Special Events Report, "The International Newsletter of 
Events Sponsorship and Lifestyle Marketing," is the bible of this 
new and lucrative business. 
Its editors believe that the 
Quincentenary has the great potential for generating special 
events, but they have been highly critical thus far of attempts 
by the Jubilee Commission and others to exploit this promise.

The problem has to do with focus.

meanings and controversies that makes quincentenary programming

such a lush array of possibilities in the humanities is not a 
blessing but a curse to the promoter of a special event. 
If we 
can't get away anymore with those three famous words -- Columbus 
discovered America -- then where is the message that can be 
packed into a TV sound bite or a logo or a tag line or the 
grabber sentence of a press release. 
In a mediacentric society 
bombarded by competing messages, simplicity and certainty are 
everything. 
If we don't know exactly where Columbus landed, 
where are we going to send the cameras and dignitaries on October 
12? 
Special events promotion and the values it enforces have 
already transformed sports and is having a significant impact on 
the arts. 
Humanities organizations and professionals will be 
insulated somewhat by the nature of their work, but some will be 
drawn into this arena. 
For one thing, in the absence of 
plentiful government funding, the special events boom offers a 
tempting source of programming funds. 
For another, there is the 
matter of integrity -- the ambiguous relationship between the 
special event and historical reality. 
Events producers are smart 
enough to know that the public only permits itself to be 
partially fooled. 
People don't pay to go into museums to see 
reproductions; they go to see the real thing, "a piece of the 
24 
true cross," as Brooke Hindle once phrased it. 20 
Of course there 
is reality and reality. 
A museum exhibition is itself a thorough 
modern thing, utterly at odds with the authentic processes 
embodied in the original act of creation of a work of art. 
And 
works of art are themselves contrived. 
Delacroix's painting was 
assembled from visual elements and ideas that had little or 
nothing to do with the actual historical realities his paintings 
sought to portray. 
And for that matter, even the actual event of 
Columbus' triumph in Barcelona contained elements of contrivance. 
The very fact that one of the most widely remarked-upon aspects 
of his triumph were departures from court etiquette -- both 
Ferdinand and Isabella rose to greet him and allowed him to 
remain with his head covered in their presence -- testifies to 
the importance attached to established procedures and formal 
rituals in such seemingly spontaneous events. 
Wherein does 
ceremony and ritual slip from the plane of authenticity to that 
of phoniness, from a "real" event to a pseudo-event? 
Humanities scholars and institutions will inevitably be 
drawn into providing answers to such questions, for their 
professional certification of a special event can afford a 
substitute for certainty. 
An event can be deemed to be 
authentic, to be endowed within enough integrity to bid up the

price of admission or sponsorship, on the say-so of certified 
authority, much as the certification that a painting gains 
through exhibition in a prestigious museum bids up its value. 
Time is short and money is scarce, as far as the Quincentenary is 
concerned. 
Should we grasp the nettle and try by participating 
in the planning of events try to enhance their educational value 
or at least engage in damage control? 
Or should we stay on the 
sidelines as observers and critics? 
I once thought that the 
answer to this question was obvious. 
I no longer do. 
To explain 
this decay of certitude, I am working on a book of my own. 
Hopefully, you can add it to your quincentennial bookshelf in 
time for the big event in 1992.
