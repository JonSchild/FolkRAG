Irish Character song. 
Written expressly for and sung by FRED Amiss, Trish Comiquo 
I 
just arrived in town to-day, 
From Ireland I 
came ; 
And if you want to know it, boys, 
Pat Gargen that's my name. 
I 
left my native land behind, 
And crossed the raging sea ; 
To make America my home. 
The bright land of the free. 
Spoken.—Yes, but I'll never forget the dear oulil times we had in 
Club' Ireland. 
Battering one another's heads, and kicking up tho 
devil in general. 
But you won't find a 
jollier set of boys than 
CHORUS. 
Those little Irish boys ; 
Those little Irish boys ; 
No king or qtieen—'twas ever seen, 
Could rule those Irish boys. 
Those little Irish boys; 
Those little Irish boys. 
Will take their stand—in freedom's land. 
Will those little Irish boys. 
Yes, America shall be my home, 
And here I'll take my stand; 
Till Irish boys get ready 
For to strike for Ireland, 
And when that happy day orrice*, 
And Ireland is ties; 
'Tis then I'll bid this land adieu, 
And once more cross the sea. 
Ivlien it does, you won't find a lu:ppier set of tp
,;:hoopsl
ee 
Spoken—Bat I'll never cross un til 
th at any does ai 
rive, and 
Iiintttlebeene-orld 
than— 
Then here's success to America, 
That bright land of the free ; 
May the Stars and Stripes foi ever float, 
Over the land and sea. 
But should a 
cloud of war o'ershade, 
Columbia's happy land; 
The Irish boys will be the first 
To lend a 
helping hand. 
Spoken — Yes. and we'll strike such a 
terror in the hearts of our 
foe, that when they see us coming th ey'll err out in terror.—here 
comes them blarsted—

Next Sunday afternoon,

Thy father's hearth was home to me, 
No selfish love was mine for thee, 
Unholy and unwise. 
Come, come, &c.

Though calm my hope has burned aml true. 
My cheek is pale and worn for you. 
And sunken are mine eyes 1

My veins shall feel the rosy tide.

THE HAND AND THE GLOVE. 
By SAMUEL LOVER. 
6 " 
To horse ! to horse !" the trumpet sings, midst clank of spear and 
shield, 
The knight int ,) 
his saddle springs, and rushes to the field ! 
A lady looked from out her bower, the stately knight drew near, 
And from her snowy hand she clropt her glove upon his spear. 
lie Waco(' it on his helmet's crest, and joined the gallant band ;— 
" 
The lady's glove it now is mine, but soon I'll win the hand !" 
Above the plunging tide of fight their plumes now dance like spray; 
And many a 
crest of note and might bore proudly through the fray; 
But still the little glove was seeu the foremost of the band ; 
And deadly blows the fiercest fell from that fair lady's hand! 
Before him every f 
enlace dies; his onset none can st..nd ; 
More fatal e'en than ladies' eyes was that fair lady's hand! 
And now the trumpet sounds retreat, the foeman drops his crest; 
The fight is nast, the sun has set, and all have sunk to rest— 
Save one— who spurs his panting steed back from the conquering 
band ; 
And he who won the lady's glove—now claims the lady's hand. 
'Tis won 1—'tis won ! that gallant knight is proudest• in the land ;

Now that we've pledged each eye of blue, 
And every mailen fair and true, 
And our green island borne— to you 
The ocean's wave adorning, 
Lot's give one hip, hip, hip hurra 
And drink e'en to the coming day, 
When squadron squaro 
We'll all he there, 
To meet the French in the morning. 
May his bright laurels never fade, 
Who leads our fighting fifth brigade, 
Those lads so true in heart and blade, 
And famed for danger scorning ; 
So join me in one hip, hurra! 
And drink e'en to the cooling day, 
When squadron square 
We'll all be there, 
To meet the French in the morning. 
And when with years and honors crowned, 
You sit some homeward hearth around, 
And bear no more the stirring sound 
That spoke the trumpet's warning ; 
You'll fill and drink one hip. hurra 
And pledge the memory of the day, 
When squadron square 
We'll all be thers. 
To meet the French in the morning.

PATSEY BRALIGHAN. 
I 
am a 
true bred Irishman, from Ulster sure I 
came, 
I 
am fond of a 
lark, the boy to fight, Patsey Bralaghan is 
my name ; 
There is no soft soap about me, I 
am what they call a 
brick, 
Don't fear the divil himself, boys, when I 
have hold of this 
bit of a 
stick. 
CHORUS. 
For I'm the man, that always can, 
Injoy a 
spree as you may see. 
if there's anything wrong, I'm not very long, 
Or I'll quiet the row. I'll tell yer how, 
I 
t' they shout and bawl, I'll floor them all, 
Oeh sure thare hides I'll 
an again, 
They say I'm a 
rake, and no mistake. 
There's none comes up to Patsey Bralaghan. 
For I 
am the man, &c. 
Whenever I'm in company, I 
make myself at home, 
I 
take my glass, a 
joke I 
pass, for dull care .1 
nivel. known, 
if any one offends me, or of Ireland spikes wrong, 
My shillalah I'll rise, and knock out their eyes, 
Before they'd be standing there long. 
For I 
am the man, & c. 
I 
should like to see the Irishman who'd run his country 
down, 
For men that likes thare country better are nowhere to be 
fotint1 ; 
For wit and mirth, search through the earth thare equal

It will take them all thare time, boys, says this Patsey

ROCK THE CRADLE. PAT. 
AIR:—" Rock the Cradle, John." 
Paddy Burke was a 
man of work, from Limerick town be came, 
lie married a 
buxom Irish lass, and she went by the name oi Kane; 
Now Pat and his wife, through six years' strife, were never blessed 
with a 
child, 
And when she seen one in any one's arms, this 18 what she'd cry: 
CHORUS. 
Rock the cradle, Pat, rock the cradle, Pat, 
There's many a 
man would give his right arm, 
To have a 
child like that. 
Now the war broke out, and Paddy, stout, he swore he'd go and ' list; 
To hear his wife's tongue always ding-dong, % would drive him out of 
his wits; 
So off he went, left her to repent, for doing a 
thing so wrong, 
For fathering him with that mortal sin, and singing that beastly song 
Rock the cradle, Pat, &c. 
Now Paddy Burke, this man of work, he hadn't been long away, 
Till his wife fell in with a 
big spalpeen, who soon led her astray; 
For three years long, their love was strong. till ono fine summer's day 
Paddy Burke, this man of work, came singing her favorite lay: 
Rock the cradle, Pat, itc. 
Well, Pat looked round, and soon he found a 
baby halo and strong, 
And turning to his wife, the pride of his life, said, 
"Who has been here since I 
was gone!" 
It was Providence, Pat," she said, " done that, he was good to me 
three years long. 
And now you can, with my other man, sing my favorite song."

THE IRISH POTATO. 
Piton': on the " Old Oaken Bucket." 
How sweet to the taste is the Irish potato, 
As memory awakens the thought of the plant ! 
Its dark, verdant vine-top, and beautiful blossom, 
In pleasant transition my memory haunt! 
I 
thought of the root in profusion once growing 
On the broad sunny hill-slope adjoining the mill, 
At the homestead how many we raised there's no knowing, 
For some were but small ones, and few in a 
hill. 
CHORUS. 
The mealy potato, the Irish potato, 
The thin-skinned potato that grew on the hill. 
That delectable plant I'll prize while I'm able, 
For otten at noon when returned from the field, 
I 
found it superior to all on the table— 
The best flavored edible that nature could yield, 
With what eager appetite, sharpened by labor, 
I 
plied knife and fork with a 
hearty good will! 
Alas! there are none of the old-fashioned flavor, 
None like the real " Simons " that crew on the hill. 
The mealy, &e. 
How prime from the full heapen dish to receive it, 
As. poised on my fork, it ascends to my mouth ! 
No appeal to the palate could tempt me to leave it, 
Though affected by rot on a 
long summers drouth • 
And now far removed from that situation, 
Where I 
used to partake of the root to my fill, 
Fancy fain would revert to my father's plantation, 
, And sigh for the " kidney " that grew on the hill. 
The mealy, ece.

MISTER BARNEY. 
Mister Barney one day went to Limerick fair, 
And hired a 
noddy to carry him there, 
To meet pretty Shelah Megan. 
But Shelah, who'd waited some time for the boy, 
And thought he'd been playing with Katty Molloy, 
To tell him her mind thus began : 
Och ! Mister Barney, 
None of your carney ; 
Hands off, and don't be so free ; 
You've been with the girls, 
Your muffin face tells, 
And the devil may have you for me, Mr. Barney. 
Mister Barney, who little thought thus to be used, 
Made an oath that his honour and word she abus'd, 
And could she be Shelah Megan ? 
Then running to kiss her—she cried, it you're wise, 
Don't touch me, or Barney, I'll scratch out your eyes, 
I 
know you're a 
vile wicked man; 
So, Mister Barney, 
None of your carney ; 
Hands off, and don't be so free; 
You've been with the girls, 
Your baby-face tells, oce. 
Mister Barney then pull'd out a 
bit of a 
rope, 
And told her that since he had nothing to hope, 
He'd hang up for Shelah Megan. 
But Shelah, grown softer, his purpose to check, 
Cried, no : if you bang, let it be round my neck, 
Though Barney, arn't you a 
sad man? 
Och ! Mister Barney, 
Pretty-faced Barney, 
And is it the ring there I 
see 
We'll ride in the noddy,

KILL PATRICK OF TULLY MIJCKLE'S OREIG 
I 
havn't sent you a 
letter since the I 
last time that I 
wrote, I 
Because we have moved from our former place of resi-
dence, and couldn't tell where a 
I 
letter will find you 
out I 
But I now with pleasure take up my pen to inform you of 
the death of your own living uncle whose health 
has now gone out I 
Kill Patrick who died alter a 
lingering of six I 
months or 
there-about, I 
He died at Tully Muckle's Creig, June twenty-nine, eigh-
teen hundred and forty- nineteen. 
The poor man was in violent convulsions during the I 
whole 
time of his sickness, 
Lying perfectly quiet and spachless, all the time talking 
incoherently and crying for I 
whiskey and potatoes. I 
An' I 
am at a 
loss to tell what his death was occasioned by, 
but I 
I 
think 'twas his last illness. I 
For he was never well ten days together during the whole / 
time of his confinement, and since dead he has I 
re-
mained quite spachless. 
He died at Tully Muckle's Creig, June forty-one, eighteen 
hundred and ninety-six. 
The jury said all his death was occasioned by eating too 
much rabbits stuffed with peas and gravy, or too 
much peas and I 
gravy stuffed with rabbits. I 
And I'm blowed if I 
can tell which, inasmuch as Kill Pat-
rick was so I 
unsteady in his habits, I 
I 
think it was both what killed him but I 
could I 
never ' 
make out the discovery, I 
But, be that as it will, as soon as he breathed his last the 
doctors gave I 
over all hopes of his recovery. I 
lie died at Tully Muckle's Creig, June 21st, 1790 leven. 
I 
am at a 
loss to tell you anything about his age, but in 
March last he would have been just I 
41 years ould I 
Lacking ten months, end had ho lived till that time ho 
would have been just six mouths 3

KILL PATRICK OF TULLY, &C.—[ CONCLUDED. 
His property now belongs and devolves to his next kin, 
who all I ( lied some time ago. I 
So I 
think it will be divided ' twixt us, and you know his 
property was very I considerable as I've been tould. I 
He died at Tully, & c, 
He had a 
fine estate which was I 
sold to pay his debts, I 
e.nd the remainder he lost at a 
horse- race which I 
nearly 
gave him fits. 
Sometimes one was ahead and sometimes Vother,and I 
now 
and then 'twas both on 'em, I 
Tut it was the opinion of every one at the time that he 
would won the race if the horse he run against had 
I 
not been too last for him. I 
He died at Tully, &e. 
You haven't a 
living relation in the world except your 
two cousins and myself who were, I 
kilt in the last 
Nvar, 
Oh, blood, thunder and turf, I 
can't dwell on this mourn-
ful I 
subject any more, I 
I 
shall sale my letters with black saling wax, and put on 
your I 
Uncle's coat of arms, I 
So I 
beg you will not break the sale when you open the 
lether, and don't open it tell three or four days alt er 
you receive it by which time you will be fully pre-
pared I 
for the mournful tidings. I 
He died at Tully, &c. 
Your ould sweetheart sends her love to you I 
unbeknowns 
to me ; I 
And when Teddy McGraw arrives in America, ax him for 
the letter he I 
brought across the sea. I 
And if he can't tell it from the rest, it is the 
one lie 
brought from me. I 
Speaking or your own living Uncle's death, saled in black 
saling wax and I 
directed to America. I 
He died at Tully, &c.

THE SHAMROCK AND THE LILY. 
Sir Shamrock sitting drinking. 
At close of day, at close of day, 
Saw Orange Lily, thinkhg, 
Come by that way, come by that way ; 
With can in hand he hail d 
him, 
And jovial din, and jovial din, 
The Lily's drought ne'er faird him— 
So he stept m, so he stept in. 
At first they talk'd together, 
Reserved and flat, reserved and flat, 
About the crops, the weather, 
And this and that, and this and that— 
But, as the glass moved quicker, 
To make amends, to make amends, 
They spoke— though somewhat thicker— 
Yet more like friends, yet more like friends. 
" 
Why not call long before, man, 
To try a 
glass, to try a 
glass ?" 
Quoth Lily- 4. People told me 
You d 
let me pass, you'd let me pass— 
Nay. and they whisper'd too, man 
Death in the pot, death in the pot, 
Slipt in for me by you, man— 
Though I 
hope not, though I 
hope not." 
"Oh foolish. foolish Lily 1 
Good drink to miss, good drink to miss, 
For gossip all so silly, 
And false as this, and false as this; 
And 'tis this very way, man, 
With such bal , chat, with such bald chat, 
You're losing, day by day, man, 
Much more than that, much more than that.

Here in this land of mine, man, 
Good friends with me, good friends with me, 
A

Your life might be, your life might be, 
But—jars for you 1

You bilious grow, and thin, man,

To take my drop, to take my drop,

And then to stop, and then to stop. 
"And why should not things be so. 
Between us both, between us both?

Oh why, for little Willy, 
So much ado, so much ado?

Can he, for all you shout, man,

And strike them dumb, and strike them dumb ? 
Or breezes mild make blow, man,

TEDDY'S SPRIG- OF SEIILLELAB". 
I'm a 
comical fellow, I 
tell you no fib, 
And I 
come from the bogs of Killaley; 
You may see I'm the thing, by the cut of my jib, 
Aid they christened me Teddy O'Rielly; 
I 
asked dad for a 
fortune, he answered so smart. 
He'd got none for himself, so none could he part. 
Spoken.—And so, d'ye see, I began the world with an 
Irish estate— that's a 
true honest heart. 
And a 
snug little sprig of shillelah. 
Dad's blessing along with mQ, off then I 
goes ; 
Success to the bogs of Killaley; 
Anti Erin go bragh was the motto I 
chose, 
Like a 
sound hearted Teddy ; 
For if she did not flourish, what good could I 
do ? 
Och ! and then for her friends, I've a 
heart warm and true 
Spoken.—And, as fel her enemies, och ! to be sure now, 
and I 
wouldn't give them a 
hand ! Och ! yes, but I 
would, 
and along with it, too 
A nate little sprig of shillelah. 
Then I 
came to this town, where the world's all alive, 
Success to the bogs of Killaley; 
And soon I 
learnt how many beans go to five, 
What a 
wonderful Teddy O'Rielly ; 
My pockets were empty, my heart full of glee, 
°eh! that was meat, drink, washing, lodging to 
me. 
Spoken.—Ai11i then the young vargins! och ! to be S111'0, 
and I 
didn't make a few conquestesses, and the laurel s, 
my dear jewels. the laurels ; arrah : and is it the laurels

ONE BOTTLE MORE. 
Assist me, ye lads. who have hearts free from guile, 
To sing in the praise of old Ireland's Isle, 
Where true hospitality opens the door, 
And friendship detains us for one bottle more— 
CHORUS. 
One bottle more, one bottle more, 
And friendship detains us for one bottle more, 
At a 
tavern one night, I 
will sing of a 
set 
Of six Irish blades who together had met ; 
Four bottles a-piece made Itot call for the score, 
And nothing detain'd us but one bottle more— 
One bottle more, one bottle more, , 
And nothing detain'd us but one bottle more. 
Our bill being paid, we were loath to depart, 
For friendship had grappled each man by the heart, 
Where the last touch you know makes an Irishman roar. 
So a 
whack from shillelah brought six bottles more— 
Six bottles more, six bottles more, 
A whack from shillelah brought six bottles more. 
Slow Phcebus now peep'd through the window so bright, 
Quite happy to view her bless'd sons of the light, 
So we parted with hearts neither sorry nor sore, 
A

Twelve bottles more, twelve bottles more, 
And the next Uwe we meet we'll have Orlin bottles.

GRANDFATHER BRIAN. 
Grandfather Brian departed this life, 
It was on Saint Patrick's day, 
He started oft to the next world, 
Without ever asking the way. 
Leaving me all his riches, 
With a 
great deal of wealth, d'ye see; 
With a 
pair of his cloth leather breecheS, 
That buttoned up down to the knee. 
CHOPXS. 
Hurrah for my Grandfather Brian, 
I 
wish he wa living, och sure! 
And every day he'd be dying, 
To be leaving me ten times as much more. 
He left me the whole of two sides of bacon, 
Only nue half was just cut away ; 
With a 
broomstick with the head of a 
rake on, 
And a 
field lull of straw to make hay. 
He left me some props and some patches, 
With a 
beautiful new smock frock ; 
Six beautiful hens to lay duck ege-s, 
Only one turned out to be a 
cock. 
Hurrah, & C. 
He left me a 
well full of water, 
oniy some said it was dry. 
Three pit fulls of sand. lime. and water, 
Awl a 
squinting lout- cat with one eye, 
lie lett me an old dog and kitten. 
His lap:stone. knife, and brad-awl, 
With a 
lump or Dutch ehee,e, that was bitten, 
And a 
box full of nothing at all. 
Hurrah, &c. 
He left me a 
ghlss that was broken, 
Willi a

And faith. it' the truth not- t

And a

Hurrah, 4ke 
He left me a 
mighty fine clock, to, 
Full ot brass wheels made OHL of wood; 
A key without ever a 
lock, too; 
A stool to sit down where I 
stood. 
A blanket made out of cloth patches, 
A bread basket made out of tin ware, 
A window \vithout any sashes. 
And a 
horse- collar made for a 
mare. 
Hurrah, &e. 
He left me a 
starling, a 
beauty, 
But it turned out to he a 
thrush ; 
He bid me in life do my duty, 
And never comb my hair with a 
brush. 
He left me six pounds, all in copper ; 
With a 
splendid straight rule, double bent 
And a 
beautiful ' bacea-stopper, 
With a 
view of Blackwater, in Kent 
Hurrah, tte. 
He left me some whiskey for drinking, 
And a 
beautiful stick, look at that ; 
And also a

And a

He left me it shirt all in tatters. 
Amongst other things I 
must state; 
And a 
rare stock of old broken platters, 
And in fact all the family plate.

And when I

I 
went up to my eyes in deep mud 
He left me a

THE STIRABOUT POT, 
At the outlets of our city lived, 
A widow woman, Mistress Keogh, 
Who to gosther, as old women do, 
To neighbors' houses, she'd not go. 
No china plate, or useless worth, 
tiedeck'd her neat but humble cot, 
Her principal bit of furniture was, 
uucky little stirabout pot. 
Tol ol, &c. 
A widowed life she led, although 
She couldn't escape from scandal's tongue, 
It was soon found out she had a 
beau, 
A 
lad who at a 
tavern sung. 
They said she had a 
tidy purse, 
I 
can't say whether she had or not; 
But every night he'd visit her, 
His eyes were centre'd in her pot. 
Tol ol, dcc. 
At meal times he was sure to come, 
When the oatmeal was boiling it out; 
And to all her questions he was dumb, 
Except the pot she'd talk about. 
He'd perch himself beside the hob, 
'Till the dishes were filled up smoking hot, 
And while he used the shovel and gob, 
I 
Hs whole discourse was—on the pot. 
Tol ol, 
e. 
lie kept working on the hungry dodge,

THE STIRABOUT POT.—[ CONCLUDED. 
One night, she says, half joke, half gag, 
" 
You think you've a 
mighty warm spot, 
The meal is out, so take the bag,' 
"No, nor the devil a 
toe without the pot." 
Tol ol, &e, 
She thought it better to lose it, than 
To lose a 
couple of feed each day. 
Aud he was scorched by the summer's sun, 
While to his lodgings he made his way. 
He found he had an awkward load, 
So he roll'd his cap into a 
knot, 
And to make it handy on the road, 
Like a 
helmet be stuck on the pot. 
Tol ol, &e. 
He stumped along the Circular-road, 
Proud as a 
sweep in Sunday clothes ; 
But, stepping over a 
heap of mud. 
The pot slipp'd down below his nose. 
To hoosh it up, in vain he tried. 
The more he hoosh'd the tighter it got, 
He sat down, and to himself he cried 
" 
There's a 
cod's head stewing in the pot." 
Tol ol, &c. 
It was lucky the widow followed Jack, 
To see what he was going to do ; 
For some children seeing him on his back, 
Began to pelt the Buggaboo ! 
He cried, " Oh. save me, widow, dear 1" 
When a 
lump of a 
paving-stone she got, 
She used until she split his ear, 
That split the friendship and the pot. 
Tol ol, &c.

Innisfallen's ruined shrine 
May suggest a 
passing sigh; 
But man's faith can ne'er decline, 
Such God's wonders floating by. 
Castle Lough and Glena Bay, 
Mountains Tore and Eagles' Nest, 
Still at Mueross you must pray, 
Though the monks are now at rest. 
Angels wonder not that man 
There would fain prolong life's spans 
Beauty's home, Killarney, 
Ever fair Killarney. 
No place else can charm the eye 
With such bright and varied tints, 
Every rock that you pass by, 
Verdure broiders or besprints ; 
Virgin there the green grass grows, 
Every morn spring's natal day, 
Bright-hued berries doff the snows, 
Smiling winter's frown away. 
Angels often pausing there, 
Doubt if Eden were more fair: 
Beauty's home, Killarney 
Ever fair Killarney. 
Music there for echo dwells, 
Makes each sound a 
harmony, 
Many-voiced the chorus swells, 
Till it faints in ecstasy. 
With the charmful tints below 
Seems the heaven above to vie, 
All rich colors that we know, 
Tinge the cloud-wreaths in that sky. 
Wings of angels so might shine, 
Glancing back soft light divine: 
Beauty's home, Killanaey, 
Ever fair Killarney. 
BIDDY MAGEE 
T 
was born in the town of Tip, so gay, 
Where the boys they welt the flure away; 
Faith I 
fell in love, boys, my dye see, 
And the gial Ploved was Biddy Magee. 
I 
wint to the fair one summer's day, 
Dress'd in my Sunday frieze so gay, 
And into a 
tint I 
wint so free, 
And there I 
met with Biddy Magee. 
call'd for a 
noggin of the old ding-dong, 
Just to give a 
polish to the song. 
I 
paid for the same frank and free, 
And the first toothful I 
gave was to biddy Magee. 
I 
gave her a 
chuck under the chin, 
My blarney tale I 
did begin, 
To be my .rife she did agree, 
So condescending was Biddy Mageek. 
Then, my boys, a 
week after that, 
Biddy she married her darling Pat; 
The boys I 
invited to join in the spree, 
Of the weddin' of Patt an' Biddy Mageo. 
There was tall Macguire and Dinny ()Moore, 
Phalv an Tim, to welt at the flure; 
MsGorman the fiddler, who never could see, 
He came to squint at Biddy Magee. 
The whisky went round in quarts galore, 
Those who were knock'd up fell on the 'Jure: 
Thin Phrly and Tim, to kick up a 
spree, 
Swore, they'd have the first kiss from Biddy Magee. 
I 
bate the divils that very night, 
And put the company all to flight 
Sis 1, my boys you shall see, 
What a 
kiss you'll get from Biddy Magee. 
We finish'd the row as we did begin, 
Thin Biddy and I 
put out the glim; 
We went to bed at last, d'ye see. 
So Biddy is now sweet Mistress 0' flea. 
I AM THE LAD CAN DO THE TRICK. 
My name you see is Dicky May, 
A lad that's ever blythe and gay, 
I 
laugh when other people cry, 
For care, you see, is all my eye. 
So not to let my passions cool, 
went unto a 
dancing-school, 
Some people say my noddle's thick, 
But I'm the lad can do the trick. 
Cllottus.—Higgdedy, piggledy, heel and toe, 
Flare up music, oft we go, 
Shutilety. Shufflety, cut and kick. 
0, that's the way to do the trick. 
My master, when I 
did begin, 
Showed me how ladies' hearts to win, 
He taught me how to place my toes, 
The newest cut to blow may nose. 
Then after I 
was done with this, 
Says he, rn show you how to kiss, 
It made me then my lips to lick, 
I 
soon was sharp at that same trick. 
Higgledy, & c. 
And next with ladies Ann and Bet. 
I 
learned to walk and minuet. 
And at the ball to come the swell, 
Like ' lobby Smike at Clerkenwell, 
My togs were finished to my will, 
And Mr. Cabbage sent his bill. 
Which I 
resolved should stand on tick, 
0, that's the way to do the trick. 
Iliggledy, &C. 
Thus gaily rigged I 
forth did rove, 
And to the ladies whispered love, 
But not in wedlock meant to bind, 
Till some good fortune I 
could find. 
At 1asit maiden fair I 
found, 
Possessed of twenty thousand pounds, 
Iler shiners did my heart afflict, 
So I 
asked it she would do the trick. 
Higgledy, &c. 
She bade m(t go and ask her ma, 
Ifer ma referred me to her pa. 
Her pa referred me to the door, 
And kindly bade me come no more. 
But at night I 
softly stole unseen, 
And coaxed my love to Gretna Green, 
She bolted oft with me right quick, 
Wasn't that the way to do the trick. 
Higgledy, &c. 
THE LEAVES SO GREEN. 
When life hath left this senseless clay, 
By all but thee forgot; 
Oh I 
bear me, dearest, far away, 
To some green, lonely spot. 
Where none with careless step may tread 
The grass upon my grave, 
But gently o'er my narrow bed 
" 
The leaves so green" may wave. 
The wild flowers, too. I 
loved so well, 
Shall breathe their sweetness there, 
While thrush and blackbird's songs shall swell 
Amid the fragrant air. 
No noisy burst ot joy or woe 
Will there disturb my rest, 
But silent tears in secret flow 
From those who loved me best. 
The crowded town and haunts of men 
I 
never loved to tread, 
To sheltered vale or lonely glen 
My weary spirit fled. 
Then lay me. dearest, Jar away, 
By other eyes unseen, 
Where gleams of sunshine rarely stray, 
Beneath the " leaves so green." 
THE MOUNTAIN DEW. 
By SAMUEL LOYER.

With what delight in summer's night Nre trod the twilight gloom, 
The a 
r 
so full of fragrance from the flow'rs so full of bloom, 
And our hearts so lull of joy—for aught else there was no room 
As we wander'd both togeth r through the mountain dew ! 
" 
Those sparkling gems that rest 
On the mountain's liow'ry breast, 
Are like the joys we number— they are bright and few, 
For a 
while to earth are given, 
And are call'd aimin to heaven, 
When the spirit of the morning steals the mountain dew. 
But memory, angelic. makes a 
heaven on earth for men, 
Here rosy light recalleth bright the dep-drops back again ; 
The warmth ot love exhales them from that well-remember'd glen, 
Where we wander'd both together through the mountain dew." 
Fly not yet ; ' tis just the hour 
When pleasure, like the midnight flower 
That scorns the eye of vulgar light, 
Begins to bloom for Sons of night, 
And maids who love the moon. 
'Twas but to bless these hours of shade 
That beauty and the moon were made ; 
'Tis then their soft attractions glowing 
Set the tides and goblets flowing. 
Oh! slay,—Oh ! stay,— 
Joy so seldom weaves a 
chain 
Like this to- night, that oh ! ' tis pain 
To break its links so soon. 
Fly not yet ; the fount that played 
In times of old through Amnion's shade, 
Though icy cold by day it ran, 
Yet still, like souls of mirth. began 
To burn whil night was near. 
And thus shoulil woman's heart and looks 
At noon ho cold ns winter brohs, 
Nor kindle, till the night retina ing, 
Brings their genial hour for burning. 
Oh ! stay.— Oh ! stay,— 
When did morning ever break. 
And find such beaming eyes awake 
As those that sparkle here/

COME TO IRELAND NOW, MY BOYS. 
Come to Ireland now, my boys, 
Among the Pats and Durpheys, 
And there, instead of breaking stones, 
You'll get plenty meat and murphies. 
'Tis there you'll see the greenest sod 
That ever graced the ocean ; 
And when that you are leaving it 
Your heart will feel emotion.

THE TIE IS BROKE, MY IRISH GIRL. 
The tie is broke, my Irish girl, 
That bound thee here to me, 
My heart has lost its single pearl, 
And thine at last is free— 
Dead as the earth that wraps thy clay, 
Dead as the Etone above thee— 
Cold as this heart that breaks to say 
It never more can love thet.
, 
I 
press thee to my aching breast— 
No blush comes o'er thy brow— 
Those gentle arms that once caress'd 
Fall round me deadly now— 
The smiles of Love no longer part 
Those dead blue lips of thine— 
I 
lay my hand upon thy heart, 
'Tis cold at last to mine. 
Were we beneath our native heaven, 
Within our native land— 
A 
fairer grave to thee were given 
Than this wild bed of sand— 
But thou' west sinple in thy faith 
And single in thy worth, 
And thou should'st die a 
lonely death, 
And lie in lonely earth. 
Then lay thee down and take thy rest, 
My last—last look is given— 
The earth is smooth above thy breast, 
And mine is yet unriven 
No mass—  no parting rosary— 
My perished love can have— 
But her husband's sighs embalm her corse, 
A 
husband's tears her grave.

THE GIRLS OF THE WEST. 
By CJIMILF,S L EVER., Esq. 
Air—" Teddy ye Candor." 
You may talk if you please, 
Of the brown Portuguese, 
But wherever you roam, wherever you roam, 
You nothing will meet, 
Half so lovely or sweet, 
As the girls at home, the girls at home. 
Their eyes are not sloes, 
Nor so long is their nose, 
But between me and you. between me and you 
They are just as alarming, 
And ten times more charming, 
With hazel and blue, with hazel and blue. 
They don't ogle a 
man, 
O'er the top of their fan, 
Till his heart's in a 
flame, his heart's in a 
flame ; 
But though bashful and shy, 
They've a 
look in their eye, 
That just comes to the same, just comes to the same. 
No mantillas they sport, 
But a 
petticoat short, 
Shows an ankle the best an ankle the best, 
And a 
leg ; but, 0 murther ! 
I 
dare not go further, 
So here's to the West; so here's to the West.

TIPPERARY. 
Were you ever in sweet Tipperary, where the fields are so 
sunny awl green, 
And the heath-brown Sliev.e-bloom and the Galtees look 
down with so proud a 
mien ! 
'Tis there you would see more beauty than is on all Irish 
ground— 
God bless you, my sweet Tipperary, for where could your 
match be found? 
They say that your hand is fearful, that darkness is in 
your eye; 
But I'll not let them dare to talk so black and bitter a 
lie. 
Oh ! no, macuskla storm n ! bright, bright, and %Vann are you, 
With hearts as bold as the men of old, to yourselves and 
your country true. 
And when there is gloom upon you, bid them think who 
has brought it there --
Sure a 
frown or a 
word of hatred was not made for your 
face so fair ; 
You've a 
11:111(1 
for the grasp of friendship— another to 
make them quake, 
And there Nvelcome to whichsoever it pleases them most 
to take. 
Shall our homes, like the huts of Connaught, be crumbled 
before our eyes? 
Shall we tly, like a 
flock of wild geese, from all that we 
love and prize ? 
No! by those \vho were here before us, no churl shall our 
tyrant be ; 
Our land is theirs by plunder, but, by Brigid, ourselves 
are free. 
No ! we do not forget the greatness did once to sweet Erin 
belong; 
No treason or craven spirit was ever our race among; 
And no trown or no word of hatred we give— but to pay 
them back ; 
In evil we only follow our enemies' darksome track. 
Oh ! come for a 
while among us, and give us the friendly 
hand ; 
And you'll see that old Tipperary is a 
loving and gladsome 
land ; 
From Upper to Lower Ormond, bright welcomes and 
smiles will spring,— 
On the plains of Tipperary the stranger is like a 
king.

SONGS OF OUR LAND. 
Songs of our land, ye are with us forever: 
The power and the splendor of thrones pass away; 
But yours is the :night of some far-flowing river, 
Through summer's bright roses, or autumn's decay. 
Ye treasure each voice of the swift passing ages, 
And truth, which time writeth on leaves or on sand ; 
Ye bring us the bright thoughts of poets and sages, 
And keep them among us, old songs of our land. 
The bards :nay go down to the place of their slumbers, 
The lyre of the charmer be hus ed in the grave; 
But far in the future the power of their numbers 
Shall kindle the hearts of our faithful and brave, 
It will waken an echo in souls deep and lonely, 
Like voices of reeds by the summer breeze fanned; 
It will call up a 
spirit of freedom, when only 
Her breathings are heard in the songs of our land. 
For they keep a 
record of those, the true-hearted, 
Who fell with the cause they had vowed to maintain ; 
They show us bright shadows ot glory departed, 
Of the love that grow cold, and the hope that was vain: 
The page may be lost, and the pen long forsaken, 
And weeds may grow wild o'er the brave heart and hand; 
Bat ye are still left when all else hath been taken, 
Like streams in the desert, sweet songs of our land. 
Songs of our land, ye have followed the stranger 
With power over ocean and desert afar ; 
Ye have gone with our wanderers tkro' distance and danger. 
And gladden'd their path like a 
home- guiding star; 
With the breath of our mountains in summers long vanish'd, 
And visions that passed like a 
wave from our strand; 
With hope for their country and joy from her banished, 
Ye come to us over sweet sons of our land. 
The spring- time may come with the song of her glory, 
To bid the green heart of the forest rejoice; 
But the pine of the mountain though blasted and hoary, 
And rock in the desert can send forth a 
-voice. 
It is thus in their triumph for deep desolations, 
While ocean waves roll or the mountains shall stand; 
Still hearts that arc bravest, and best of the nations, 
Shall glory and live in the songs of our laud. 
THE IRISHMAN. 
The savage loves his native shore, 
Though rude the soil and chill the air ; 
Then well may Erin's sons adore 
Their isle which nature formed so fair. 
What flood reflects a 
shore so sweet 
As Shannon great, or pastoral Bann? 
Or who a 
friend or foe can meet 
So generous as an Irishman ? 
His ham( Is rash, his heart is warm. 
But honesty is still his guide ; 
None more repents a 
deed. of harm, 
And none forgives with nobler pride: 
He may be duped, but won't be dared— 
More fit to practice than to plan; 
He dearly earns his poor reward, 
And spends it like an Irishman. 
If strange or poor, for you he'll pay, 
And guide to where you safe may be; 
If you're his guest, the while you stay 
11 is cottage holds a 
jubilee. 
His inmost soul he will unlock, 
And if lie may your secrets Sean, 
Your confidence he scorns to mock, 
For Faithful i 
an Irishman. 
By honour bound in woe or weal, 
Whate'er she bids he dares to do, 
Try him with bribes— they won't prevail ; 
Prove him in fire—you'l I 
find him true. 
Tie seeks not safety, let his post 
Be where it ought in danger's van; 
And if the field or fame he list. 
It won't be an Irishman. 
Erin ! loved thud ! from age to age, 
Be thou more great, inure famed, and free; 
May peace be thine, or, shouldst then wage 
Defensive war—cheap victory. 
May plenty bloom in every field, 
Which gentle breezes softly fan, 
And cheerful smiles serenely gild 
The home of every Irishman

THE DEAR LITTLE SHAMROCK.—[CoNcLunan.] 
That dear little plant still grows in our land, 
Fresh and fair as the daughters of Erin; 
Whose smiles can bewitch and whose eyes can command 
In each elimate they ever appear in. 
For they shine thro' the bog, thro' the brake, and the mireland, 
Just like their own dear little Shamrock of Ireland: 
The dear little Shamrock, the sweet little Shamrock, 
The dear little, sweet little Shamrock of Ireland. 
That dear little plant that springs from our soil, 
When its three little leaves are extended, 
Denotes from the stalk we together should toil, 
And ourselves by ourselves be befriended. 
And still thro' the bog, thro' the brake, and the mireland, 
From one root should branch like the Shamrock of Ireland.: 
The dear little Shamrock, the sweet little Shamrock, 
The dear little, sweet little Shamrock of Ireland. 
oca! NORAH DEAR!

I'm waiting here, 
I'm watching still for you, love: 
And while you sleep, the flow'rets weep, 
All shrined in tears of dew, love. 
The silvery moon its bright rays soon 
Behind the hills will fade, love 
But better there her beauties bear: 
For thou her beams would shade, love.

LAMENT OF MORIAN SHEa0N.E FOR MISS 
MARY BOURKE. 
" 
There's darkness in thy dwelling place, and silence reigns above; 
And Mary's voice is heard no more, like the soft voice of love. 
Yes ! thou art gone, my Mary dear; and Morian Shelton° 
Is left to sing his song tf woe; and wail for thee alone. 
Oh! snow white were thy virtues— the beautilul the young— 
The old with pleasure bent to hear the music of thy tongue; 
The young with rapture gazed on thee, and their hearts in love were 
bound, 
For thou wast brighter than the sun that sheds its light around. 
My soul is dark, oh ! Mary dear! thy sun of beauty's set; 
The sorrowful are dumb for thee— the grieved their tears forget; 
And I 
am left to pour my woe above thy grave alone; 
For dear wert thou to the fond heart ot Morian Shehoue. 
Fast flowing tears above the grave of the rich man are sited, 
But they are dried when the cold stone shuts in his narrow bed: 
het so with my heart's faithful love— the dark grave cannot hide 
From Morian's eyes thy form of grace, of loveliness, and pride. 
Thou didst not fall like the sere leaf, when A 
utumn's chill winds blew, 
'Twat; a 
tempest and a 
storm blast that has laid•my Mary low. 
Had'st thou not friends that loved thee well—bad'st thou not garments 
rare? 
Wast thou not happy, Mary—was thou not young and fair 7 
Then, -why should the dread spoiler come, my heart's peace to destroy, 
Or the grim tyrant tear from me my all of earthly joy ? 
Oh ! am I 
left to pour my woes above thy grave alone! 
Thou idol of the fait hful heart of Morian Shehone ! 
Sweet were thy looks and sweet thy smiles, and kind wast thou to all; 
The withering scowl of envy on thy fortunes dared not fall ; 
For thee thy friends lament and mourn, and never cease to weep; 
Oh! that their lamentations could awake thee from thy sleep ! 
Oh! that thy peerless form again could meet my loving clasp! 
Oh ! that the cold damp hand of Death could loose his iron grasp! 
Yet, when the valley's daughters meet beneath the tall elm tree, 
And talk of Mary as a 
dream that never more shall be; 
Then may thy spirit float around, like music ill the air. 
And pour upon their virgin souls a 
blessing altd a 
prayer. 
Oh! am heft to pour my wail above thy grave alone 7" 
Thus sinks in silence the lament of Morian Shebone!

SUMMER LONGINGS. 
By D. F. AITAitTuy. 
Alt ! my heart; is weary waiting, 
Waiting for the May— 
Waiting tor the pleasant rambles, 
Where the fragrant hawthorn brambles, 
With the woodbine alternating, 
Scent the dewy way. 
Ali ! my heart is weary waiting, 
Waiting for the May. 
Aim ! my heart is sick with longing, 
Longing for the May— 
Longing to escape from study, 
To the young face lair and ruddy, 
And the thousand charms belonging 
To the summer's day. 
Ali I 
iii 
heart is sick with longing, 
Longing for the May. 
Ah ! in 
heart is sore with sighing, 
Sighing for the May— 
Sighing for their sure returning, 
When the summer beams are burning, 
Hopes and flowers that dead or dying 
All the winter lay. 
Alt ! my heart is some with sighing. 
Sighing for the May. 
Al; ! my heart is pained with throbbing, 
Throbbing for the May— 
Throbbing for the sea-side billows, 
Or the watet-wooing willows; 
Where in laughing and in sobbing 
Glide the streams away. 
All! my heart, my heart is throbbing, 
Throbbing for the May. 
Wait ing sad, dejected, weary, 
Waiting for the May. 
Spring goes by with wasted warnings; 
Moonlit, evenings, sunbright mornings; 
Summer comes, yet dark and dreary 
Life still ebbs away: 
Man is ever weary, weary, 
Waiting for the May!

IRISH SONG. 
Lto ( Tso. K. CAM.) 
An r-- .‘ 
I 
remember, I 
remember.' 
0 
Eva! when the gentle moon is watching from on 
high, 
And when the stars, like golden gems, are sparkling in 
the sky, 
I 
will meet thee, I 
will meet thee, in the lonely sham-
rock dell, 
And ru sing to thee, ma colleen beam, the song you love 
so well. 
The love I 
bear you in my breast is faithful still, and 
true, 
As when my lips unfolded first the secret unto you— 
But, oh! its deep intensity, no words of mine can tell ; 
So, darling, then I'll breathe Win the song you love so 
well. 
! 
many a 
moon has filled and waned since I 
met thee 
before. 
Still in my bosom thou'rt enshrined, as in those days of 
yore, 
When the zephyr sighed so softly, and the evening 
shadows fell, 
And first I 
woke for thee, asthcrre, the song you love so 
well. 
And years may fill the tide of life OA youth appears a 
dream; 
Yet I 
will cling to thee, my love, with fondness just the 
same 
As in that summer evening, in the lonely shamrock 
dell, 
When first my vows I 
whispered in the song you love 
so well. 
IRISH MARY. 
By JOHN Basim. 
Far away from Erin's strand, 
And valleys wide, and sounding waters, 
Still she is, hi every land, 
One of Erin s 
real daughters: 
Oh ! to meet her here is like 
A dream of home and natal mountains; 
On our hearts their voices strike— 
We hear the gushing of their fountains! 
Yes! our Irish Mary dear ! 
Our own, our real Irish Mary ! 
A flower of home, fresh blooming come, 
Art thou to us, our Irish Mary. 
Round about us here wc see 
Bright eyes like bets, and sunny faces, 
Charming all !— if all were free 
Of foreign airs, of borrowe:1 graces. 
Mary's eye, it flashes truth I 
And Mary's spirit, Mary's nature, 
Irish lady," fresh in youth, 
have beamed o'er every look and feature! 
Yes! our Irish Mary dear! 
When La Tournure cloth make us weary, 
We have you, to turn unto 
For native grace, our Irish Mary. 
Sighs of home f—her Erin's songs 
O'er all her songs we love to listen ; 
Tears of home !—lier Erin's wrongs 
Subdue our kindred eyes to glisten! 
Oh ! should woe to gloom consign 
The clear fire-side of love and honor, 
You will see a 
holier sign 
Of Irish Mary bright upon her ! 
Yes ! our Irish Mary dear 
Will light that home though e'er so dreary, 
Shining still o'er clouds of ill, 
Sweet star of life, our Irish Mary

THE GREEN ISLE. 
By THOMAS Moonz. 
Fairest ! put on awhile 
These pinions of light I 
bring thee, 
And o'er thy own green isle 
In fancy let me wing thee. 
Never did Atiel's plume, 
At golden sunset hover 
O'er scenes so full of bloom, 
As I 
shall vaft thee over. 
Fields, where the Spring delays, 
And fearlessly meets the ardor 
Of the warm Summer's gaze, 
With only her tears to guard her. 
Rocks, through myrtle boughs 
In grace majestic frowning, 
Like some bold warrior's brows 
That Love had just been crowning. 
Islets, so freshly fair, 
That never hath bird come nigh them, 
But from his course duo' air 
He had been won down by them. 
Types, sweet maid, of thee, 
Whose look, rhose blush inviting, 
Never did Love yet see 
From Heav'n, without alighting. 
Lakes. where the pearl lies hid, 
And caves where the gem is sleeping, 
Bright as the tears thy lid 
Lets fall in lonely weeping. 
Glens where Ocean collies. 
To 'seape the wild wind's rancor, 
And harbors, worthiest homes, 
Where freedom's fleet can anchor. 
Then, if while scenes so grand, 
So beautiful, shine before thee, 
Pride for thy own dear land 
Should haply he f.0 eating o'er thee ; 
Oh, let grief conic first, 
O'er pride itself victorious— 
Thinking how man had enrst 
What Heaven bath made so glorious!

THE REBEL GIRLS OF CORK. 
By SriAmos. 
Come, want you then a 
toast, my boys? 
I'll give you one, I 
Iveen,— 
Suppose we toast the Irish girls, 
Who wear the rebel green; 
Who wear the rebel green, my boys, 
In spite of " Fashion's " frown. 
Then let ns boast our proudest boast— 
The girls of " Cork's own town.' 
The girls of " Cork's own tom-
I..' boys, 
The girls of " Cork's own town," 
Then let us toast our proudest boast— 
The girls of " Cork's own town." 
Who'd woo a 
maid to love him, were 
He rebel to the laws? 
Who'd win a 
maid to work, and aid, 
Or suffer for the cause? 
Then let him search the universe, 
From Dublin to New York, 
And, mark my word! he'll find her 
'Mongst the girls of " Rebel Cork." 
The girls of " Rebel Cork," boys, 
The rebel girls of Cork, 
I'd risk my life, to make my wife, 
A rebel girl from Cork. 
God bless them ! at. the " Rising" 
They were stirring to and fro, 
And many a 
footsore outlaw 
Did they shelter from the snow.

THE REBEL GIRLS OF CORK. [CONCLUDED. 
For when the flying columns quick, 
To crush a 
few came down, 
We still were cheered and aided by 
The girls of " Cork's own town." 
The girls of " Cork's own town," boys, 
The girls of " Cork's own town ;" 
With willing hearts they did their parts, 
The girls of " Cork's own town." 
The girls of " Dublin city," boys, 
Are true, and good, and fair, 
And glad would be the " boys" to see 
A marching thro' Kildare 
But, for the bravest Irish girls. 
To pray, to wait, or work. 
Give me the ones who aid us 
Like the rebel girls of Cork. 
The rebel girls of Cork, boys, 
The rebel girls of Cork; 
Oh ! won't we stand for Ireland, and 
The rebel girls of Cork. 
What care we for a 
foeman's sneer— 
A red rag, or a 
Queen ? 
We bow but to a 
God on high ! 
And Ire]and's rebel green. 
And we will plant on ev .ry hill 
From Derryveagh to Tore, 
A rebel banner woven by 
The rebel girls of Cork. 
The rebel girls of Cork, boys, 
The rebel girls of Cork; 
We'll always toast our proudest boast— 
The rebel girls of Cork.

GO I 
FORGET ME. 
BY the REV. CHARLES WoLFE• 
Author of the " Burial of Sir John Moore." 
Ant:—" Open the Window." 
Go forget me, why should sorrow 
O'er that brow a 
shadow fling? 
Go! forget me—and to-morrow 
Brightly smile, and sweetly sing. 
Smile—though I 
shall not be near thee; 
Sing—though I 
shall never hear thee, 
May thy soul with pleasme shine, 
Lasting as the gloom of mine. 
Like the sun—thy presence glowing, 
Clothes the meanest things in light ; 
And when thou, like him, art going, 
Loveliest objects fade in night. 
All things looked so bright about thee; 
That they nothing seem without thee. 
By that pure and lucid mind 
Earthly thit gs were too refined. 
Go! thou vision, wildly gleaming, 
Softly on my soul that tell; 
Go! for me no longer beaming, 
Hope and beauty, fare ye well! 
Go, and all that once delighted 
Take—and leave me all benighted, 
Glory's burning gen'rous swell, 
Fancy, and the poet's shell. 
KITTY OF COLERAINE. 
As beautiful Kitty one morning was tripping 
With a 
pitcher of milk from the fair of Coleraine ; 
When she saw me she stumbled, the pitcher down 
tumbled, 
And all the sweet buttermilk watered the plain. 
Oh ! what shall I 
do now? 'Twas looking at you now; 
Sure, sure, such a 
pitcher I'll ne'er meet again, 
"Iwas the pride of my dairy, 0, Barney McCleary, 
You're sent as a 
plague to the girls of Coleraine 
I 
sat down beside her, and gently did chide her, 
That such a 
misfortune should give her such pain ; 
A 
kiss then I 
gave her, and ere I 
did leave her, 
She vowed for such she'd break it again. 
"fwas hay-making season, I 
can't tell the reason, 
Misfortunes will never come single ' tis plain ; 
For very soon after poor Kitty's disaster, 
The devil a 
pitcher was whole in Coleraine?

THE COLLEEN BAWN. 
An old man sat all desolate, 
A sire of some seventy years ; 
His cheeks once hale, were now worn and pale, 
His eyes bedimmed with tears. 
His body bent, o'er a 
grave he leant, 
And cried out, " My Nora's gone, 
And she's left me here, in this world of drear, 
My own little Colleen Bawn." 
The birds of song, the groves among, 
Mock his grief with their merry strain ; 
And with music sweet, they the old man greet, 
But their songs were all in vain ; 
He heeded net their merry note, 
But sadly did he moan, 
" 
Oh ! thou art gone, I 
still live on, 
My own little Colleen Bawn." 
The flowers of May, that summer's day, 
Bloomed over his favorite child, 
And the old man wept as he knelt where she slept, 
And thought on her spirit mild ; 
For no Summer'r hour, nor bird, nor flower, 
That e'er bedecked the lawn, 
Could gladden his sight, or his heart make light, 
Since he'd lost his Colleen Bawn. 
THE COLLEEN BAWN. ' [CONCLUDED. 
" Ah, Colleen ! " he cried, " since thy mother died, 
Thou the whole world wert to me; 
And even thy smile could my heart beguile, 
From the depth of its misery ; 
Light, light was thy form, thy bosom warm, 
And gladsome as a 
fawn. 
But thou art dead, I 
kneel by thy head, 
My own little Colleen Bawn. 
"My Colleen dear, I'm kneeling here, 
In the place where thy grave is made ; 
Ali! why didst thou die, or why am not I 
With thee in the grave now laid ? 
I'm old and worn, and now quite forlorn, 
Then pray for me darling one, 
That I 
soon may return, in my coffin borne, 
To join thee, my Colleen Bawn." 
The old man sued to his cottage bed, 
And he laid him calmly down ; 
And a 
spirit bright as a 
form of light, 
To the old man's eyes was sliown. 
It brighter grew, and the old man knew 
The days of his grief were done ; 
One sigh he gave o'er her early grave, 
And he slept with his Colleen Bawn.

In valleys lone I 
pliteli'd the flowers, 
And wove them in her hair. 
And never in the greenwood bowers 
Was forest queen as fair. 
She gave a 
silent glance at me, 
With love-light flowing o'er, 
Oh ! well that love's returned to thee, 
My Marie Donn Astoir. 
The sloethorn woos the poplar brown, 
Where shine the sunlight hill, 
Its blossom?, watt an odor down 
O'er heather slope and rill. 
Her hand is as that blossom white, 
As pure her bosom's core— 
My well of joy, my life's delight, 
My 3Iarie Donn Astoir. 
I've strung my harp to many a 
lay, 
With soothing magic sound ; 
I've sung to lords and ladies iray 
Throughout old Ireland's ground; 
But now I 
find its tones are vain 
The ancient songs to pour, 
Thy name alone that fills the strain,

THE EMIGRANT'S INVITATION. 
An Irish Ballad composed by T. I1LEwirr. 
Oh, come to the new world, my Tilielah, 
Where want is a 
thing never known ; 
Where all who will work may be earning, 
And all that they earn be their own. 
I 
wish that a 
rail they'd be makihg 
To bring you across the green say ;— 
You'd bid your adieu to the old world, 
And be in the new in a 
day. 
That s 
aisy to talk of, but its not yet thought of, 
Still you promis'd we never should part.; 
For Shelah, my beauty, ' tis surely your duty 
To follow the boy of your heart, 
To follow the boy of your heart, 
To follow the boy of your heart, 
To follow the boy of your heart, 
To follow the boy ot your heart. 
Are ye fearing the long journey, Shelah ? 
It will not be long as ye'll prove, 
If ye'll think on the joy that ye'll bring me, 
And measure the distance by love. 
There's a 
charm in those far distant places 
That bothers the mem'ry I'm tould ; 
And, seeing so many new faces. 
It's aisy forgetting the ould. 
Don't wait for leave-taking, — such things are heart-
breaking— 
You promis'd we never should part ;— 
I 
know that my jewel will never be cruel— 
She'll follow the boy or her heart. 
To follow ite.

PADDY'S PROPOSAL. 
By Da. R. D. 
JOYCE. 
Ant;—" No! Mr. Gallagher." 
I 
had a 
young sweetheart and asked her to marry me, 
She frowned that my impudence so far could carry me ; 
Said, to ask her to marry a 
poor serf in slavery, 
Was nothing but meanness and all kinds of knavery ! 
She told me to handle a 
pike ere she'd list to me,, 
And vowed if I 
didn't by that and by this to me, 
She'd join for a 
rebel to vex and to harry me, 
Or remain an old maid, and she never would marry me ! 
Het fingers I 
squeezed in the big brawny hand o' me. 
And went with a 
captain who took the command o' me, 
Off to the hillside to practise the drilling there, 
The pike and the rifle, and all kinds of killing there. 
I 
came back again when I 
thought he'd perfected me, 
She said I 
returned long before she expected we, 
And bade me be off with the devil may carry me, 
And till Ireland was tree, she never would marry me ! 
Then I 
kicked my caubeen for relief to my devilment, 
And thought for a 
time, what words so uncivil meant— 
" 
Begor ! she had spirits," said I, " like the Queen o' hearts 
And bates to tarnation whate'er I 
have seen of hearts !" 
I 
took up my pike, and its handle I 
kissed again,

half sprained my wrist again,

And the next time I 
asked her, she surely would marry 
me! 
I 
took to the hills with our roving and airy boys; 
And ' tis me that manceuvred like gallant Tipperary boys. 
But we had no provisions, no tents for to cover us, 
But the snow, and the rain, and the fogs rolling over 
We had a 
smart skirmish one day as a 
feeler there, 
To make out the strength of the soldier and Peeler there— 
" 
Och!" says I when ' twas over, " now nothing need 
worry me, 
so easy to kill them,the surely will marry me." 
But the sleet. and the rain kept incessantly pouring there, 
And the floods rattled down, and the tempest was roaring 
there 
'Twas these, not the soldiers nor Peelers could sunder 
us, 
For when they stood before us we soon brought them 
under us— 
Now site comes to my cave in the hills were I'm hiding 
here, 
And site gave me such courage, so gay and confiding 
here. 
'Phat I'm sure Fortune's wheel to the topmost will carry me, 
That we'll soon free old Ireland and Mary will marry me l

That rankle at her core ; 
Our scorn and hatred? To her foes, 
Like Paddies evermore. 
The hour is past to fawn or crouch 
As suppliants for our right; 
Let word and deed unshrinking vouch 
The banded millions' might; 
Let them who scorned the fountain rill, 
Now dread the torrent's roar, 
And hear our echoed chorus still, 
We're Paddies evermore.

CAROLAN AND BRIDGET CRUISE. 
By 
SAMUEL LOVER. 
[It is related of Carolan, the Irish bard, that when deprived of 
sight, and after the lapse of twenty years, lie recognized his first 
love by the touch of her baud. The lady's name was Bridget Cruise; 
and, though not a 
pretty name, it deserves to be recorded, as be-
longing to the woman who could inspire such a 
passion.) 
" 
True love can ne'er forget; 
Fondly as when we met, 
Dearest, I 
love thee yet, 
My darling one!" 
Thus sung a 
minstrel gay 
His sweet impassion'd lay, 
Down by the ocean's spray 
At set of sun, 
But wither'd was the minstrel's sight, 
Morn to him was dark as night, 
Yet his heart was full of light; 
As he thus his lay begun: 
" 
True love can ne'er forget; 
Fondly as when we met, 
Dearest. I 
love thee yet. 
My darling one! 
Long years are past and o'er, 
Since from this fatal shore, 
Cold hearts and cold winds bore 
My love from Inc." 
Scarcely the minstrel spoke, 
When quick, with flashing stroke, 
A boat's light or the silence broke 
O'er the sea. 
Soon upon her native strand 
Doth a 
lovely lady land, 
While the minstrel's love- taught hand 
Did o'er his wild harp run 
" 
True love can ne'er forget; 
Fondly as when we met, 
Dearest, I 
love thee yet, 
My darling, one !" 
Where the minstrel sat alone, 
Thei e. that lady fair had gone, 
Within his band she placed her own, 
The bard dropped on his knee. 
From his lips soft blessings came, 
He kissed her hand with truest flame, 
In trembling tones lie name ,I---her name, 
Though he con Id not see. 
But oh 1— the touch the bard could tell 
Of t 
hat dear hand. remembered well, 
Ali by many a 
secret spell 
Can true love find her own ! 
For true love can ne'er forget; 
Fondly as when they met; 
He loved his lady yet, 
His darling one.

writer never wrote a

this one is the least of all open to 
that fault.

of the best sea stories in any lan-
guage, 
Thousands have laughed

man placed in a 
position so fitted for seeing the sail-
or's life as Captain 31arryatt, and 
never one so able in portraying it.
