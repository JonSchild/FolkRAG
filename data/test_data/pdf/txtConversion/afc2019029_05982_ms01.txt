[00:00:00] Brief introduction; Daniel Harnsberger (“The Progressive Liberal Daniel Richards”) 
describes basic personal background information including his date of birth, his hometown of 
Richmond, Virginia, and his current place of residence in Henrico, Virginia.  
 
[00:01:35] Harnsberger details his interest in professional wrestling from an early age. He notes 
that while Richmond, Virginia was a “Jim Crockett territory” he also watched televised WWF 
events based out of New York. Harnsberger’s “first foray” into professional wrestling was 
Wrestlemania III featuring Hulk Hogan versus Andre the Giant. He describes himself as a 
devoted “Hulkamaniac.” Harnsberger was also the only athlete in his family. 
 
[00:03:49] Harnsberger recounts his own journey towards becoming an independent professional 
wrestler. He talks about beginning his training in a “half burned-down old skating rink” in West 
Virginia where he trained for three months before having his first match in 2003. Training 
consisted of “learning how to ‘bump’ or fall,” holds, and maneuvers. “Learning how to put it 
together is a career-long process.” Harnsberger discusses influential mentors and their 
connections to regional “territories.” Famed wrestlers Scotty McKeever and Beau James played 
a role in Harnsberger’s in-ring education.  
 
[00:06:51] Harnsberger shares his thoughts on the idea of “character creation.” “It comes across 
so much more authentic to the audience when it’s really just you.” He talks about his original 
persona, “Daniel Richards,” who was “just a guy” that lacked any real development. “The 
Progressive Liberal” was an idea Harnsberger had been crafting for a period of time and was 
unveiled as a response to Donald Trump’s presidential nomination. Harnsberger outlines the 
Progressive Liberal’s attitude, approach to wrestling, and how fans respond to his “liberal 
agenda.”  
 
[00:10:20] Harnsberger talks about the challenges of building relationships with audience 
members based on divisive political differences. He believes that individuals living within the 
Appalachian region have “an aversion to outsiders” as well as a “persecution complex.” 
Harnsberger touches briefly on southern stereotypes and “built-in insecurities.” He theorizes this 
is why the Progressive Liberal is “so foreign” to wrestling fans throughout the Appalachias. 
Harnsberger also discusses fan interactions. “There’s no relationship, or there’s a very bad 
relationship.” 
 
Similar to Appalachian stereotypes, Harnsberger addresses common misconceptions related to 
the world of indie pro wrestling. “...that wrestling is just a southern thing, but the fans are all 
over the world.” He also takes issue with the belief that wrestling is “fake.”  
 
[00:16:25] Harnsberger provides an overview of a typical show day from start to finish. He 
recalls “making shots” throughout Kentucky, which oftentimes involved catching rides with 
other wrestlers. Harnsberger’s schedule consisted of multiple shows on Friday, Saturday, and 
Sunday. “I just wanted to do business and then go home.” He comments on car rides as places of

learning, advice giving, story swapping, etc. “What happens in the ring is such a small 
percentage of the whole deal.”  
 
[00:20:45] Harnsberger considers how individual matches are structured but refrains from 
divulging too many industry secrets. “At the end of the day, you’re trying to put something 
together that entertains the people and advances the storyline.” Planning matches is dependent 
upon opponents, but Harnsberger stresses the collaborative element. “There’s no match that’s 
exactly alike.” He praises the creativity process and touches briefly on a particular wrestling 
tradition.  
 
[00:24:34] Harnsberger talks about his wrestling career before the coronavirus pandemic. Bodily 
injuries and ailments have been a determining factor in Harnsberger’s decision to be more 
selective with his wrestling engagements. “I was on borrowed time.” He took a break from 
wrestling between 2009 and 2014, and from 2014-2018 Harnsberger wrestled 10-12 shows a 
month. Degradation of wrestlers’ bodies and medical issues faced by aging wrestlers. He also 
talks about “freak injuries” in wrestling.  
 
[00:28:20] Harnsberger ponders on the “most challenging” aspects of wrestling. The art of taking 
seemingly simplistic pieces and putting them together to create an engaging performance. He 
attempts to define “psychology” as it pertains to professional wrestling. “Doing things in a way 
that makes sense.” He provides examples of how psychology is used in the ring.  
 
[00:31:59] Harnsberger evaluates the trajectory of his career path and how much more he could 
have accomplished. “I’m proud of that because my idea came to life...I thought it would have 
traction but not in the way it ended up doing.” He talks about a “last man standing” match from 
Appalachian Mountain Wrestling that was especially rewarding. He also shares the struggle of 
watching particularly painful matches, too. Harnsberger shares the high points throughout his 
career.  
 
Parallels are drawn between Harnsberger’s current profession as a real estate agent and his 
experiences as an indie wrestler, especially as it pertains to building a brand via social media. 
“I’m sure I could have been better with social media.” He discusses his dislike of posting things 
for attention and engaging with fans on a more personal level.  
 
[00:36:52] Harnsberger takes a retrospective look at changes in the world of pro wrestling over 
the course of the last two decades. He mentions that when he first started there was “a lot more 
emphasis on protecting the business.” The globalization of wrestling and the explosion of job 
opportunities. He notes an increase in talent and performance ability.  
 
Harnsberger also reflects on how performing in the national spotlight affected his in-ring 
dynamic, especially as it pertains to wrestling outside the Appalachian region. “It made me 
branch out a lot more.” He also considers how well the Progressive Liberal would do during the 
2020 election cycle. “The country’s still super polarized.” Harnsberger discusses how social 
issues on a national scale are reflected in independent promotions.

[00:45:50] Harnsberger offers advice to those interested in becoming indie pro wrestlers. “If 
you’re gonna do anything, treat it like a full-time job.” Exercise, watch newer and older matches, 
and “find something that makes you stand out.” He once again finds points of intersection 
between real estate and professional wrestling.  
 
[00:48:06] Harnsberger concludes with several thoughts on the future of the Appalachian region. 
Healthcare, environmentalism, publicly-funded elections, protests, and other social issues are 
addressed. He also touches on current scandals within the wrestling industry.
