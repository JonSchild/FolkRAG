P: 
--[inaudible] 
I: 
You’re saying, “African American’s don’t like?” 
P: 
The African people come here? 
I: 
Now? That are coming here now? 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
Huh. 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
That’s something I wasn’t aware of. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
I’m going to make sure this is recording. Okay. Are you ready? 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
All right. I think K is ready. 
I2: 
I am just going to hit record, here. So, I want to say one thing before I hit record, and that is that I know 
we have all these cameras here, and then you have two strangers in your living room, this is a space that is 
your space, and thank you for having us, but at the same time, it is weird to have a camera looking at you and 
have a mic on you. I know it’s weird. I know it’s awkward. 
P: 
Yeah. 
I2: 
But having said that, it’s really important for you to kinda forget about these cameras because we are 
here to hear who you are and your story. We are just recorders of you, so don’t do anything special for the 
camera. Just be you, and that’s why we are, yeah, so the camera does this weird thing. It’s gets people—it’s a 
weird thing, so if you could try to forget about that. I know that’s asking a lot, but I’m gonna hit record in a 
second, but I just wanted to say that because, you know, it’s a camera. 
I: 
I’m gonna add to that a little bit [1.33.38]. I think he’s trying to say just forget he’s there. Just don’t even 
pay any attention to him. He’s not—we’re going to pretend he’s not there. 
P: 
[Laughing]. 
I: 
He’ll ask a question—you know, he’ll occasionally ask a question, and then he’ll look like he’s not 
paying any attention to you, but he’s actually paying great attention— 
P: 
Paying, yeah. Yeah. Yes. Everything [laughing]. 
I: 
He’s listening, but he’s going to focus on all of his equipment, and the same with me. We want to hear 
your story not my story. We want to hear your voice, not my voice. So, normally I would engage in 
conversation, but for this interview I’m not going to say very much at all. Okay? So, if you respond to a 
question, and you’ve got a great answer, inside I’m going to be going, wow! That’s such a great answer, but on 
the outside I’m just gonna sit here and go, hmm [group laughter]. So, it’s [laughing] not that I’m not excited 
about your answer, it’s just that we want to hear you not me. Okay? 
P: 
Mmm hmm [1.32.30]. 
I: 
I think that those are the main points. If you’re comfortable with getting started, we’ll go ahead and start.

P: 
Okay. Start I guess [laughing]. 
I: 
Okay. K, you’re done? 
I2: 
Yup. Ready to go. 
I: 
Yes. Okay. All right. So, here we go. First of all, T, I want to say thank you very much— 
P: 
You’re welcome. 
I: 
--for agreeing to this interview, and also for the work that you do. The reason we’re here is because we 
believe your work is really valuable, and we want to hear your story and share it with others, so they can 
understand how valuable it is too. And they can understand more about what’s it’s like to do personal care 
work, and what your life is like as a personal care worker. So, thank you very much for everything you do, and 
we want to start with your story. Where did it begin? I’m going to ask you though to actually go back a little 
further because I know that you’re from Rwanda. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
And you had a career in Rwanda before you even—you had a professional career in Rwanda before 
you even came here. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
So, if you’re comfortable talking about it, I would love to hear that whole story. What was your career in 
Rwanda, and why did you come here 14 years ago, and what has it been like since? And how did you get into 
personal care work here in the United States? 
P: 
Okay. In my country I was a nurse in the hospital [1.30.41], big hospital. I was working in the birth 
center for 15 years. Yeah. 
I: 
Delivering babies? 
P: 
Delivering babies. Yeah. 
I: 
As a nurse? 
P: 
As a nurse. After civil war in 1994, I moved to—I was working with the kid’s lost—separated with their 
parents with the Red Cross. They tried to find those lost kids in the families or the orphans. 
I: 
In Rwanda? 
P: 
In Rwanda, in my country, and we did the research according to something in what the kids said. Some 
kids were too young—the babies—but we tried to do the unification with the parents, and we did the foster-care 
parent, the foster care. Some people told you where they were when they got the baby, the kids, and from 
there we tried to find the true families, the true parents. 
I: 
So, you were working with the Lost Boys trying to reunify them with their parents? 
P: 
No. Was not the lost boys. The lost boys are those kids on the street or somewhere. 
I: 
Okay. 
P: 
No.  Those kids, you see when they shot with the guns—they heard the guns shooting, they run and—
the kids run, and their parents run different places, and the kids are lost. Some families—around the 
[inaudible], okay. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018

I: 
So, they would run in different directions. 
P: 
Different directions, and like I can walk, and you find kids running himself and crying. Crying, and I can 
take him at my home. And with those kids, the foster-care parents, you go to the Red Cross somewhere to ask 
if you can find the kids parents. It’s that I was working with [1.26.58]. 
I: 
Were you able to get kids and parents back together again? 
P: 
Yes. Reunify, yeah. Many reunification I did. Yeah. 
I: 
Okay. Wow. What a hard job. 
P: 
Yeah. It was hard, but it was—I remember one year, reunify with grandma. Mom was died, and I found 
the grandma according to the—I did the mom ID. Somebody who took the baby, the baby was on the street. 
They don’t know how mom died, and with the mom ID with, yeah. I took the ID. That was in the city of Mann. I 
went there. I found the grandma. 
I: 
And you reunited the baby with the grandmother. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
That must have felt really good. 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
That’s a happy ending. 
P: 
Yes. Yeah. 
I: 
I’m sure you have so many stories— 
P: 
Yes, with the reunification [laughs]. 
I: 
--would love to hear those stories, but— 
P: 
Yeah, with the reunification. 
I: 
So, then after that, what happened? 
P: 
And after that, after the reunification, I came in United States. 
I: 
And what brought you here? Why did you come? 
P: 
Yeah. My husband came before me, 2 years before me [1.25.12]. He came, hope he gonna study. He 
has his niece who live—who was living in Indiana, and he came, hope he gonna get in school here—medical 
school, and when he got—he was hard to study, and he took his tuition for the school himself. He apply for 
asylum, and he got it. He went to school and work, and from there he applied for us to come. 
I: 
So, he went to Indiana where he had a niece? 
P: 
Yeah. When he came first he was in Indiana, but he didn’t stay there for long time. He come in 
Michigan. He had the friend—he has a friend here. He come for helping for petition out of the government 
application. Yeah. When he found the school, have work for him because he doesn’t—it’s too expensive when 
you’re international student. 
I: 
Too expensive for medical school? 
P: 
Yeah.

I: 
So, he got a job.  
P: 
Yeah. He got a job, and he went to school, but he didn’t finish again because he had to work a double 
for us to come [laughing], to pay the ticket to come, and when we got here—I come with two teenagers. One 
went in the college, and the other one was in middle school, and he had to work hard again for the college—
my daughter’s college [1.23.04] [laughing]. 
I: 
Where did she go to school? 
P: 
She took nursing school. She didn’t finish it too, but now she finish the nursing school. 
I: 
Good for her, so she’s a nurse, now, as well? 
P: 
Yeah. She’s a nurse. 
I: 
Like her mother. 
P: 
Yeah. And the younger one is a nurse too. The one in France is a nurse too. 
I: 
All three daughters are nurses? 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
Wow. You must have been a great role model? 
P: 
[Laughing]. 
I: 
So, your husband applied for asylum, was granted asylum, and then you were able to come over with 
the kids, and you—so you’ve been here 14 years. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
And you said you are a US citizen. You applied for citizenship and were granted citizenship. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
Good. So, tell us a little bit about your work history here in the United States? 
P: 
Oh, when I got here I was thinking I’m gonna take some classes in the nursing like I was in my back 
home, but that was not true. When I got here, they told me to work in laundry. That was a hard job. I was 
thinking the nursing—my nursing in my country’s hard work in the hospital, but the laundry was hard—more 
than that. Yeah. You have to iron the clothes and [1.21.36] pull 500 clothes by—I don’t know what I made 
[laughing]. 
I: 
What company was that? Or was that a hospital? 
P: 
No, no, no, no. Was the ironing—hmm—it’s a company here. 
I2: 
Baryames? 
P: 
Yes. 
I2: 
The dry cleaning. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. Dry cleaner. 
I: 
So, the dry cleaner was even harder than nursing? 
P: 
It was hard [laughs].

I: 
Because of all the ironing—standing. 
P: 
Standing, and work, yee, yee, yee, yee. I not familiar to work like that [laughing]. 
I: 
So, you wanted to work as a nurse, but you weren’t able to do that. 
P: 
Yeah. I did that because when you got here the first time they have to find you a job in 3 months. You 
have to find a job, any job. Is that all the refugees do. They have to find you a job, and you never say, no, I 
don’t want to work with this one. You have to find a job to pay your bill. If they give you money for 3 months—
it’s 3 months—after 3 months, they stop everything [1.20.18]. Okay. Is that pay, went to work. From there I 
said, no, no, no, no, no. This is not my job. I have to go to school. I have to go to school [laughs]. Okay. I went 
to school. I took—at that time I was taking English—ESL—English as a second language. I had to take the 
class. I was working in the laundry afternoon, and in the morning go taking English classes because in my 
country they speak French, no English. We study English, but we don’t speak English. Okay. Okay. I went, 
took English. I was level 3 too. I studied by 2. I went to 3. Okay. There I took PCT classes—patient care 
technician. 
I: 
Patient care technician—PCT? 
P: 
Yes. PCT. 
I: 
Okay. 
P: 
Yeah. I mean it was [inaudible] many hours—94 point—I was working. I did my training, my clinical in 
Sparrow. I apply for job. Never get job there. With the PCT you work in hospital. Ingham or Sparrow is the 
hospital I know. I apply for there and didn’t get a job. Okay. From the laundry, I went to work for housekeeping. 
Okay, the housekeeping was in a nursing home. I want to take again the classes for nurse aide. 
I: 
A certified nursing assistant? 
P: 
Yes. Okay. But when I went to work in the nursing home, I saw how it was hard to be nurse aide, to 
work like a nurse aide. I prefer to stay housekeeping and be near those resident. I could talk with them or help 
them, but not be nurse aide. 
I: 
And tell me why? 
P: 
Was too hard. 
I: 
Too hard in what way? 
P: 
From the resident and from the nurses [1.17.31]. Anything you do is [inaudible], and like I was to work 
in my back home, if you make a mistake, the nurse you work with come to you and tell you, “This is a mistake. 
You have to do this, to do this, to do this.” But in this country’s not the same. The mistake I made is going up, 
up , up until the director, and they call you from the coordinator, from everywhere. And is not that one. The 
nurse you work with, the mistake you made, the nurse called it to all the nurses come to work. I said, I don’t 
speak English. That is first—no, English. I don’t know how to explain my mistake everywhere. Is why I prefer to 
be housekeeping. Okay. I work like housekeeping for 11 years in one facility. After 11 years, I was fired. If you 
go to my floor, was 2 West—second floor. The residents there can tell you how I was working, but one 
[inaudible] she came, after 6 day I work with her. She fired me. 
I: 
So, she was a management—somebody in the management. 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
Do you feel comfortable explaining why? Why did she do that?

P: 
I don’t know. I think now I can tell you what. I never call in [laughing] in my life when I was there even in 
the snow. I called and said I would come right when the road would be cleaned because I was scared to drive 
in the snow, but I got there. Okay. Until now I don’t know. Mmm hmm. I don’t know. Okay. 
I: 
That’s hard. 
P: 
Yeah. From there, is why I went to work in homecare, but I was looking for homecare for my life. When 
I got here, looking to work for [inaudible] because I was thinking that is my job. Like a nurse, and if I work for 
somebody like that, that will be good for me [1.14.43]. Is that—I want to work homecare. Those people stop by 
the hospital, but the nursing home I asked them how can I get into homecare? I applied for Great Lake many 
times, but I did homecare when I was in housekeeping. I help my neighbor who lives near me, and I called her 
grandma. I visit her all the time. When they need somebody to help, I went there. Okay. Her social work—
asking me to apply to go clean her houses sometimes they paid me. I was working for Aging—[inaudible] 
Aging, something like that. Yeah. Okay. I work for her I think for 6 years, but in those 6 years she fired me 
three times [laughing]. She was the one who fired me. 
I: 
Tell us—so, this was somebody you were working for in her home as a housekeeper? 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
And she fired you? 
P: 
Yeah. [laughing] she fired me and rehired me. 
I: 
So, tell me— 
P: 
After 2 days, she called me. “I’m so sorry. I’m so sorry. Come back.” I said, this is like my mom 
[laughing]. The last time they changed the company. They give me another company. I signed the paper. 
When I get to work, she said, “No. I don’t want you.” [Laughing I went Oooh [laughing]. I said again my prayer 
with me, but she started her Alzheimer. Yeah. 
I: 
Oh, she had Alzheimer’s Disease. 
P: 
Yeah. I was her [laughing], she came back to asking me—I went to the company I said, that is done. 
I’m not workin’ for her no more. After 1 week she came back to ask me to come work [laughing]. I said, no. 
That is done. I will visit you, but I don’t want to come work for you [laughing] no more. I stop. She went to the 
nursing home [laughing]. I went to visit her all the time with her son. Now, she died [laughing]. Yeah. 
I: 
So, you were doing homecare work even when you were in laundry at the nursing home or 
housekeeping at the nursing home. You had somebody on the side? 
P: 
Yes. Yes. 
I: 
You were taking care of somebody in their own home. 
P: 
Yeah. Because I had to go their twice a week. Yeah. Evening. They ask me to work for her for in the 
morning because they had to drop her the food, but I was not—I didn’t get more hours to quit my job. Okay. 
When they fired me, I went to unemployment; I got my unemployment. I said I’m not gonna work no more. I’m 
gonna enjoy unemployment, but was for 10 weeks, 20 weeks [laughing]. After 20 weeks, they said [laughing, if 
you don’t find a job we’re gonna stop [laughing]. That’s why I wanted to get a job [laughing]. Okay. I found the 
company work in homecare. I applied there. They hired me. I started to work for homecare. It was very nice. I 
liked the job, but with the job when your client went to the hospital you stop. You sit down and wait the time he 
comes back from the hospital. You are not paid. Yeah. [1.10.22]. 
I: 
So, when your client’s in the hospital, you’re not getting an income.

P:

I: 
That’s a problem. 
P: 
Yeah. That is a problem. Okay. 
I: 
And that was through an agency? 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
And you were doing personal care work? 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
Did you ever complete the certified nursing assistant program? 
P: 
No. 
I: 
No? Okay. So, this agency would hire—hired you. 
P: 
Because I got the PCT. 
I: 
Okay. 
P: 
Yeah. The PCT. 
I: 
All right. So, you worked with an agency doing personal care work. Are you still doing that? 
P: 
The agency—I don’t work for it no more because I took a vacation. When I took a vacation, I came 
back. My client was in the hospital. I had two client. Yeah. Two. And the other one—she changed the company 
when I left [laughing], the agency when I left. I was waiting the one in hospital because it was, yeah, [1.09.11]. 
From there—after 3 weeks, I was all the time waiting. They called me to go work somewhere for 1 hour, 
somewhere for 3 hours, somewhere for 3 hours, is why I applied for Hospice. And I had another company, but 
that I cleaned houses. Those houses for those elderly people. Yeah. 
I: 
Okay. So, now, you have a job with Hospice? 
P: 
I have job with Hospice. I have a job with agency—those agency—I clean the house. 
I: 
Oh, both. 
P: 
Yeah. Both. 
I: 
You have Hospice and an agency. 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
And then some private clients? 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
And between all of them are you getting enough hours to make ends meet? 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
You are? 
P: 
Mmm hmm.

I: 
And when we come back, we’ll continue the story. So, it gives you a chance to sort of think about things 
and what stories you might want to tell. When we come back, I’ll ask you tell some stories about different 
situations you’ve faced as a personal care worker. 
P: 
Oh, okay. 
I: 
So, but I’m glad to hear that you’re able to make ends meet. Now, you’re getting enough hours—
between the three different jobs, you’re getting enough hours? 
P: 
The Hospice. The Hospice, they can give me more hours, but with the Medicaid—this Medicaid I got, I 
have to [laughing] take—I have to check my hours, yeah.

P: 
Yeah.  
I: 
Okay. 
I2: 
I’m ready if you guys are. 
I: 
Okay. Well, we’re back on, and we want to continue your story. You were talking about Hospice. You, 
now, have, it sounds like sort of three jobs. You’re working at Hospice at night. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
And then you have some personal care work agency, and then you have some private clients. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
Right? 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
And one of the private clients is M’s mother-in-law, right? 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
So, tell us—you said you’re getting enough hours to make ends meet, which is great. Can you share 
with us a little bit more about these jobs? Like what is the hourly rate for each of them? How much do you get 
paid? 
P: 
Okay. With the Hospice, I’m paid $10.50. With the agency, it’s $10. With M, it’s $13. 
I: 
Thirteen, okay. And you mentioned that you had wanted to do homecare for a long time even when you 
were in Rwanda. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
And now you’re doing it. 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
So, are you happier now about—instead of doing laundry work?  
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
Tell me what you like about it? Why did you want to do homecare work? What is it that appeals to you? 
P: 
Do you know what, when you are a nurse you work with the sick people, those kind of people [1.02.15], 
and with the homecare I was working—the first agency I work for there, I was working with the elderly and the 
handicap. The handicap is the one who touch my heart. 
I: 
In what way? 
P: 
Yeah. He’s a guy—he become 33-years-old when I was there. He was born like that. He was in a 
wheelchair. He was paralyzed with [inaudible]. We had to help him for poop, and he was—he has a heart—you 
can not explain how he was. He was all the time happy, but when he got angry, he can broke everything in the 
house. You have to be careful with him. That—I think that teach me to be patient with those people. He can tell 
you all his story from when he was born. And that touch my heart. Mom and dad divorce, and he got love from 
mom, love from father and from step-mother, but step-father didn’t—never visit him. Never, and he was one to 
tell him—I ask him, did your step-father [inaudible]. He said, “No.” Is why he don’t ask? 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Therese Mukarushema. 7.7.18 
 
10
I: 
I didn’t quite get that. If you could tell me again. His mother, father, step-mother loved him, but not his 
step-father. And you asked him—tell me again what you asked him? 
P: 
I asked him does your step-father has the children—have the children? He said, “No. He never get a 
child, is why he do not ask.” 
I2: 
He never had a child. 
P: 
Him and his sister. 
I: 
He never had his own children and that upset him, so this is why he didn’t like his step-children? 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
I see. 
P: 
I did not know—[inaudible] he told me I didn’t go far away to ask why [59.14], but that I know—I saw he 
never visit him in his apartment. He was living in his own apartment, and he aide for 24-hours. I was the one 
who put him in the bed and go home around 10 pm, after I leave him in the bed. 
I: 
So, you’re job was to help him get in bed, get ready for the night. 
P: 
Ready for the night. Mmm hmm. 
I: 
And then you would leave about 10 pm. 
P: 
Set him a dinner for night, and help him for everything, and put him in the bed. 
I: 
And this man touched your heart? 
P: 
Yeah. Is the one who touch my heart. 
I: 
Because of his story? 
P: 
Yeah. And he’s physical bad—how he was.  
I: 
He was happy unless he got mad? 
P: 
Working. He will never get married. He as [laughing] that is a big story with the girlfriend [laughing]. 
I: 
Tell us the story. Well, tell us the story.  I wanna hear stories. 
P: 
[Laughing] he had once—when I got there they told me the story about the—his girlfriend was a 
divorcee, caregiver like me, but she was a young teenager. Yeah. She was finishing high school I think, and 
she went to work. They fell in love. I don’t know, and then she was telling, “My mom knows that, and my father 
knows that. She was my girlfriend, and I want to get married with her [laughing].” And the parents, “You can’t. 
How can you get married [laughing]?” And he don’t understand how you said he cannot get married [laughing]. 
Okay. And they share [inaudible] book, and once she saw on Facebook—I think he saw on Facebook she has 
another boyfriend. He got sick. He was sick I tell you. To come him to tell him you will have another [laughing] 
one—girlfriend was [inaudible] for me [laughing], and he was asking, “Why don’t she—I know she will come 
back. I know she will come back [laughing].” Okay.  
I: 
And how did that end? How did that turn out? 
P: 
He got sick and went to the hospital, but he come down—we try to calm him down. He will get another 
girlfriend [55.51], and he always ask, “Why my dad don’t want me to get married? Why my mom don’t want me

to get married?” [Laughing] yeah, they said, “You can’t. How can you get married? You can’t. How can you 
take care of—” Well to us say, “My wife wanna take care of me, and gonna get money, and—” [laughing]. 
I: 
So where is he now? Do you still care for him? 
P: 
No. No. Because one minute I was waiting—I got another job. I used to send him text message 
decision to say how he is doing, but when you don’t work with the same agency, you don’t go far away to the 
client is why I stop to talk with him. 
I: 
So, you started telling us about why you do this kind of work, what it is you like about it? 
P: 
Yeah. What I like [sigh], to work with the sick people, those kind of people is in my life I think [54.24] 
[laughing]. Is why I choose to do the nursing. 
I: 
It’s in your blood.  
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
It’s who you are? 
P: 
Yeah. It’s to help those people, and when I work with them I feel that’s my job. I have to help them 
because how they are, so I don’t know, but I like that. I like to work with them. 
I: 
Is there anything about it that you don’t like or that you find difficult? 
P: 
Yeah [laughs]. 
I: 
Can you tell us? 
P: 
Yes. The first one is that that I told you. When you go to work for somebody, for there I start to learn 
what is Alzheimer. How they start and how they work like, yeah. And my mom and my mother-in-law they have 
dementia. 
I: 
Your own mother and your mother-in-law both have dementia? 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
Are they here in the United States? 
P: 
No, no. Back in Rwanda. 
I: 
So, they’re back in Rwanda. 
P: 
Yeah. Back home. From my experience from my mom and mother-in-law I cannot help them. I said I’m 
gonna help the people here. Somebody will help them for me, yeah, from there too. And for that lady, the first 
one, I go to work. I try to do everything and she asking me to clean everything, to give her shower, and the 
next day she said, “Don’t come work. I fire you.” What, you fire me? “Yeah. I don’t want you.” One day she has 
these sweet potatoes. Those sweet potatoes she’s asking me if I love them? I said, yes, I like them, but I didn’t 
like them—the sweet potatoes from this country ‘cause it was too [inaudible], her word [52.10]. And the next 
time I come back she said, “You steal my [laughing] sweet potato.” 
I: 
Oh, she thought you stole her sweet potatoes. 
P: 
Yeah [laughing]. Okay. 
I: 
So, she accused you of stealing? 
P: 
Yeah.

I: 
Okay. 
P: 
I said if [inaudible] I’m not coming back to work for you. I’m gonna tell the agency, and we’re not gonna 
come back to work for you. I will never steal anything from you. If you don’t give to me, I don’t steal. Even the 
food, serve the food. Tell—maybe I can I steal money, but no food from your house. [Laughing] okay. I said I’m 
not coming back to work for you if you said I steal. Okay. I came home, spent 2 weeks. After 2 weeks, she 
called me, “Can you come back?” I said, do you remember that you said. She said [inaudible] and you don’t 
know how they go [51.02]. 
I: 
She forgot that she fired you? 
P: 
Yeah. I said, okay. I will come back for you. No problem. Yeah. I told you she fired me three times, and 
she said—one day I went there, today is day for shower. Are you gonna take shower? She said, “No, no, no, 
no, no. I’m not gonna take shower from you because I have a nurse who come to give me shower.” I ask her 
who’s the nurse who give you shower? The nurse come to check on you, but they don’t give shower. She said, 
“I know you are not a nurse. I know, but I have a nurse.” Okay. Her son come, “Mom. Do you have somebody 
who give you shower? You have to take shower.” Okay. We have to fight to give her shower. After that she 
said, “Okay. You will never cook again for me.” [Inaudible – 49.47] come they check everything you do, and if 
they said you gonna take her for shopping, if you don’t take her they reduce the hours, and the money goes 
down. 
I: 
This is the social worker from the agency or from the state? 
P: 
From—through the Medicaid. 
I: 
Okay. 
P: 
Yeah. They come. She said, “She never take me to shopping.” She said, “She never give me shower.” 
I: 
Even though you had? 
P: 
Yeah. If I [laughing] fight to give her shower— 
I: 
So, the client was telling the social worker that you weren’t doing anything for her? 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
Ah, ah. 
P: 
Okay. They reduced the hours. I had 3 hours. They give me 1 hour because it was to clean the house 
only. Okay. I said it was my second job. That was not a problem, and it was not too far from my home. I walk to 
her home. I said okay. I will come and work for 1 hour, and she—when I work for 1 hour she asked me to cook, 
to go shopping. I said, no, that is not my job for now. She was upset. I said call the agency again and tell them. 
Call your social work and tell her what you did because I used to do that for you. Okay. And when we went 
shopping, I 3 hours for cleaning. We shop for 4 hours [laughing].  
I: 
But you get paid for 3. 
P: 
For 3 [laughing]. I’m explaining to her, we have to shop for 3 hours and come back. The shopping goes 
for 1 hour and the cleaning for 1 hour and the shower for 1 hour, and we shop for 3 hours [laughing] for 4 
hours. I try to explain her; she don’t understand. That was the problem I had with her, but because I took her 
for like my mom, that was not problem with me, but the problem I had is to tell the social worker I don’t do that. 
I: 
You were willing to do all of those things, but the problem was with the social worker believing her 
instead of you— 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Therese Mukarushema. 7.7.18 
 
13
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
And then cutting your hours. 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
So, that was what was so difficult. 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
The most difficult. 
P: 
Mmm hmm, yeah. 
I: 
‘Cause it sounds like you were very, very flexible and forgiving with the client. 
P: 
Yeah [laughing] 
I: 
And willing to do all of these things and patient, but you couldn’t keep getting fired. 
P: 
Yeah. Yeah. 
I: 
Or have your hours cut, right? 
P: 
Yeah [laughing]. 
I: 
So, are there other things that are difficult or challenging? 
P: 
I have another client, but that one I didn’t [inaudible] what happened with her. She was not too old, that 
is why I said that I’m not gonna work here on the 70-year-old, when they are not handicapped in wheelchair. I 
will never, never work with them. She told me she got diabetic, and she got struck but any significant with the 
stroke. She was home all the time, and she was sitting in front of the TV since morning to night. I went there—
go there for cleaning, cook for her, and after that go home for 3 hours, but if I leave there and do the laundry, 
she was calling my agency to complain for something. “She don’t clean the house like I want. She—my 
laundry’s not—” I was not a machine to wash her clothes. “My laundry is not cleaned.” Something like that. 
Something like that [44.54]. Today, she went home early.  [Laughing] I tell my boss I’m not going there no 
more. Work for somebody who can work with herself and said I didn’t do nothing. I will never go there. Okay 
[laughing]. I stop working for her. 
I: 
So, the agency said, “Fine. We won’t send you there anymore” ?  
P: 
Yes. No more. 
I: 
Because for some reason she was complaining all the time. 
P: 
Because they had many agency to apply there. They always changes, changes, changes, changes, 
change. They don’t have anybody to work for them for wife. Those people who are not old [laughing]. Yeah. 
I: 
So, the people that are not old or not really disabled— 
P: 
Yeah. Really need help because I don’t know how they give them with the help. I work for those two 
ladies—the older people, 75-years-old, but they told me, “We apply for help for aide—”, waiting for 3 years. But 
I don’t know how those people got the aide, for help. For 3 years. 
I: 
And they’re not getting the help, but these other people are. 
P: 
Yeah. Yeah. The one is a survival cancer. Another one has a dialysis 3 times a week. They give her 2 
hours, and other one has 3 hours.

I: 
Mmm. It doesn’t make sense does it? 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
I can’t explain it either. 
P: 
Yeah.  
I: 
So, how did you meet M’s mother-in-law? 
P: 
Oh, M, is a friend from the church. 
I: 
Oh, from church. 
P: 
Yeah. I went to the church the first time I got here was M who introduced me who would come me 
[42.36]. Since then we are good friends. 
I: 
So, when you came to the United States you started at Christo Rey? Is the church the Christo Rey? 
P: 
No, no, no. It’s Centrist Church. 
I: 
Okay. Centrist, okay. So, you started going to the church, and M was one of the first— 
P: 
I was living in an apartment not far from Centrist Church. 
I: 
I see. 
P: 
M was belonging to Centrist Church. 
I: 
She was one of the first people you met. 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
And you became friends right away. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
And she helped you? 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
And you’ve been working with her mother-in-law— 
P: 
When mother-in-law came in the city, she asked me—she knows me, asked me to go help for mother-
in-law [41.52]. She was living in her house when she first come. Her husband was back in Flint, and I went to 
help her in afternoon because my hours working afternoon. 
I: 
Well, I have to tell you she said you have to talk to T because she’s so wonderful. She thinks the world 
of you. 
P: 
[Laughing]. 
I: 
I know she’s really dependent on you and grateful for your—‘cause you provide respite for her. I mean 
that’s part of the work that you’re doing. It doesn’t affect just the client, it affects the whole family. You’re 
helping M as well her mother-in-law. 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
Right? 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Therese Mukarushema. 7.7.18 
 
15
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
I mean that’s what I think. I don’t know if that’s how you feel about it. 
P: 
Yeah. Just like a family. We are like the family. Is like my sister. I said to my sister, M, yeah, and to 
[inaudible]. Yes. 
I: 
That’s an interesting thing about personal care work in the home. I think that people develop these 
relationships. 
P: 
Yes. Like those in my two client. They live together the apartment across—one apartment. They are 
like my mom. I love them. They live far away, but I don’t want to quit the job because of them. 
I: 
You made a comment earlier that you would love to be able to help your mother because she’s so far 
away. 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
And this— 
P: 
When I help those people—the M’s mother-in-law—I think about my mom all the time. I cry all the time. 
Who’s doing this for my mom? Who’s doing this for my mom, my mother-in-law? I am always crying [39.51], 
but I say if I do this like I do for my mom, somebody gonna do for my mom, too. 
I: 
Are there people helping your mother? 
P: 
Yeah. Yeah. They help my—she lives with my sister, but is not like I want [laughing], but I said, okay. 
Okay. Okay [laughs]. 
I: 
But you have family there in Rwanda, and they are stepping up to help your mother and your mother-in-
law? 
P: 
Mmm hmm. Yeah. My mother-in-law lives with my sister-in-law. That is good, but my mother who live 
with my sister is not like I want because my sister is the younger in the family, is this one. And she was the 
spoiled girl. She don’t know how to take care of mom. No, she don’t. 
I: 
It must be hard and frustrating to be so far and not be able to have it be the way you want it to be? 
P: 
Yes [laughing], yeah. My momma was living—I move from the house that I was when my dad die, and 
they will build a house not far from my mom to be close to her, and all the time I was with my—evening, 
morning. When she is sick I got up, go give her shower before I go to work, is how [laughing], and before I 
come here I was praying, why my momma don’t die before I leave [laughing]. Praying to God, let my mom die 
before I leave here. I don’t know who gonna take care of her [laughing], and I have a close friend who visit her 
all of the time [laughing], and I said when my mom was—“I miss my daughter. I miss my daughter.” But you’re 
still surviving [laughing] my friend told her. It was my friend who died before [laughing]. 
I: 
So, we appreciate you sharing these—‘cause these are hard stories, right. These are hard. So, thank 
you for sharing those with us. We’re gonna take another quick pause, and then we’ll have our final segment? 
Okay. 
P: 
Okay. Well, thanks. Almost it’s 12. 
I: 
Quarter to 12. So, we’re going to wrap up pretty soon. Your husband probably wants to come home. 
P: 
No. It’s not time yet. They finish at 12:30. Something like that.

I: 
They have a long service. 
P: 
Yeah [laughing]. 
I: 
Those 7th Day Adventists [laughing]. 
P: 
[Laughing] they have a sub school. They have some [inaudible]. 
I: 
So, you just have the one daughter that’s living a little bit close by? Your daughter in Grand Rapids 
lives close? 
P: 
I have two daughters in Grand Rapids. 
I: 
Oh, two. Okay. 
P: 
Yeah. Two there and one—the middle one.  
I: 
Are they married? 
P: 
One is married. 
I: 
Do you have grandchildren? 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
You do? 
P: 
Yeah. I have— 
I: 
How many grandkids? 
P: 
My grandson will be 1 month tomorrow [laughing]. 
I: 
One month. Oh, a brand-new baby. 
P: 
Yeah. Is brand new. 
I: 
Oh, how exciting. 
P: 
He’s coming here tomorrow maybe to celebrate his month [36.10] [laughing]. 
I: 
Oh, good. You’re gonna have a 1-month birthday party tomorrow. 
P: 
Yeah [laughing]. 
I: 
That’s nice. It’s nice you’re close by enough that you can see each other. 
P: 
Yeah. The one in France has two, a 12-years-old, and 4-years-old. Yeah [35.48]. The 4-years-old in a 
girl, and the 12 is a boy, but he don’t speak. 
I: 
Not yet. He will. Oh, 12. 
P: 
Twelve.  
I: 
Oh.  
P: 
Yeah. He don’t speak. He’s autistic. 
I: 
He has autism? 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Therese Mukarushema. 7.7.18 
 
17
P: 
Uh-huh.  
I: 
Okay. Autistic. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
So, we’re back on. And I’m gonna shift gears just a little bit and talk about the work that you do in the 
bigger context. You know, our social context here in the United States. Do you feel it’s different than Rwanda 
how elderly people are taken care of? Are there big differences between the two countries between the two 
countries in terms of how older people are taken care of? 
P: 
Yeah. Is a big difference.  
I: 
In what way? 
P: 
One for now in my country maybe everything change after the civil war, but [34.41] before you have 
your own grandma or grandpa. You take care of him until he die. We didn’t have the nursing home or 
somewhere to put them. Was from the family member. If you have a sister or a brother, they come home and 
stay with, and then you go home if somebody come. We lived across, and here in this country you see 
somebody and his house or her house, alone in her apartment, no one come to help. No one family member. 
They don’t have many people—many family members. Yeah. Maybe. They bond—two sisters, one die before, 
the nephew [inaudible] they live in different state, that is what is different. When they need somebody to come 
and to knock on the door, maybe every day to ask how are you doing? To see if they took a shower or they 
make breakfast. Yeah. That is different. 
I: 
So, some people don’t have family members— 
P 
Yeah. 
I: 
--because their kids might be living far away. 
P: 
Far away. 
I: 
Or they’ve died themselves. 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
But they’re alone, and then you have others who do have family members, but that’s different too? 
P: 
Mmm hmm. Make a call, maybe. Sometime if they make a call, sometime they said—they told you, “I 
have a son. He called me 2 weeks ago.” I ask who called you between those 2 weeks? They go, “Nobody. I’m 
alone in my house.” That is different. 
I: 
Did that surprise you? 
P: 
Yeah. That surprised me. Yeah. Is how you see somebody who died 3 days, but they find the body 
after 3 days. Yeah. And when I go there—when I knock on the door, I call, the one I call, she’s still sleeping at 
10 [31.47]. I’m scared. I say what’s going on? 
I: 
Because she didn’t answer the door you mean? 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
So, what did you do? 
P: 
Well, last time [laughing] I went there I knock on—she opened the door at 9. If I come I can find the 
door open. I went up in, she still in the bed sleeping. I asked her—I knock on the door. I call. Nothing. I say—I 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Therese Mukarushema. 7.7.18 
 
18
call again, she got up. She got up and she came. I ask her, what’s going on? She said, “I went to bed a little 
late [laughing] last night, I don’t know what happen. I fall asleep.” 
I: 
She fell asleep. 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
But it’s important for people to be checking to make sure. 
P: 
Yeah. Be checking. 
I: 
Because what would happen to these people if they didn’t—if you weren’t there? If you didn’t check on 
them? 
P: 
And sometime if they don’t want to eat, if they don’t have somebody to be there to help them for eating. 
I: 
What happens then? 
P: 
Huh? 
I: 
If they don’t have anybody to help them? 
P: 
They call. I don’t know. You go there, if you find them sick, you call the [inaudible] [laughing]. Some of 
the family member, yeah [30.22]. 
I: 
And what do you think about—so, it sounds like in Rwanda there aren’t a lot of personal care workers 
who are paid to do, you know non-family members who are paid to provide care. 
P: 
No. No. Not in Rwanda. 
I: 
You don’t have things like—right. 
P: 
No. No, no, no. 
I: 
So, what do you think about this whole idea of having paid personal care workers here in the United 
States? 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
What do you think about that? 
P: 
Is something they have to—is good for those people in the houses, good for those care worker, too. 
They find a job and they help, yeah. But the good one. 
I: 
The good ones? 
P: 
Yes. The good ones. If they can help maybe the training for—somebody who want to do the job, who 
want to do the job, who love the job not for money but for helping. Yeah. Not for money. Yeah, money come, 
but you have to help—to love the job you’re doing. 
I: 
So, the personal care workers, as a career, is a good thing. 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
If the personal care worker is good? 
P: 
Yes. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Therese Mukarushema. 7.7.18 
 
19
I: 
And that requires that they love the job. That they’re not in it for the money, and that they have some 
training? That’s what I’m hearing you saying. 
P: 
Yeah, yeah. 
I: 
Because then it’s good for the client, but it’s also good for the worker? 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
Then they can get a job, is that right? 
P: 
Yes.  
I: 
Okay. How do you feel about the job itself? Like the amount of pay you get? Is it the kind of job that a 
young person should aspire to be a personal care worker? 
P: 
Yeah. But the last time my client has a daughter. The daughter is—he’s sick. He’s young, but he is sick. 
He cannot walk. He cannot drive. She fired—five mass—she fired six people. 
I: 
She fired six people. 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
Six personal care workers? 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
And why did she do that? 
P: 
The first one, if I can remember, the first one came [27.27]. She asked her to clean the bathroom. She 
said the bathroom is cleaned. She asked her to vacuum. She said the carpet [laughing] isn’t—don’t need to be 
vacuumed. 
I: 
The worker said that? 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
Oh. 
P: 
Instead she told me, “I don’t know.” Okay. She called the agency. She said, “I don’t want her.” The next 
one come once, and she clean everything, but she didn’t come back. She don’t know what happened with her. 
She didn’t—maybe because she smokes. 
I: 
The worker smokes? 
P: 
Yeah. I think. You don’t say nothing, you quit. Might be smoke, but I don’t know her, I don’t know why. 
I: 
Hmm. 
P: 
I told [inaudible] all the time, if you can quit smoking you will be my best friend, but now, you are my 
friend, but not best friend because they smoke. Yeah. The young lady who come, the rest is fired. She came. 
She was on the phone all the time. 
I: 
On the phone? 
P: 
On the phone. She went to the kitchen, washed the dish, after the dishes set down and they go on the 
phone, she ask her, “Can you do—sweep the hall?” She went to the hall, she said, “The hall is clean.”

I: 
So, these are some examples of the kind of worker you don’t want to have [laughs]. 
P: 
[Laughing]. 
I: 
Right? 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
We don’t want workers like that.  
P; 
Yeah. 
I: 
So, before we started this conversation, we talked a little bit about the shortage. There’s a shortage of 
qualified personal care workers in this country, and we need to get more people doing the kind of work that 
you’re doing, but we want them to be qualified and kind like you are. You know, how do we do that? It’s kind of 
a hard sell because we don’t pay very much in this country. 
P: 
They don’t have any contract. Is that the problem? No benefit. 
I: 
No benefits. 
P: 
No benefit. Why they don’t give benefit to those people who work in that job? [24.43]  
I: 
That’s a good question. I wish I had the answer to that. Why not? Why don’t they? 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
So, the pay is a problem. The benefits are a problem. 
P: 
The benefit. If we can have a benefit, you can work for them, but we talk benefit, why do we have to 
drive 4 miles, drive 5 miles, no benefit? 
I: 
So, health benefits you’re talking about? 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
Okay. So, let’s say we’re talking to a group of young people, and we want to convince them that they 
should consider being a personal care worker. 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
And we know— 
P: 
Ask them to give them the benefit for those young people. They can have insurance, everything. They 
can work with the families [laughing]. 
I: 
So, it might be more appealing if they were able to get a job with some kind of pay— 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
--regular pay— 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
--and benefits. 
P: 
If I take my vacation, everything is stop [23.32]. No money. I go in my back home for 1 month, I come 
back, no money [laughing]. Nothing. No benefit. No vacation. No, nothing. Hmm.

I: 
So, why would I want to do it as a young person? You’re supposed to be convincing me that I want to 
do this? 
P: 
[Laughing] yeah. 
I: 
Now, tell me something good? [Group laughter]. 
P; 
[Laughing] okay. You are a young girl, who [inaudible] we looking for [laughing]. 
I: 
Yeah. I need a job. I need a career. 
P: 
Okay. 
I: 
Tell me what to do. 
P: 
We’re gonna give you a training. They gonna explain you how those people—you gonna work with 
them. They are different. You will somebody who got up with a big head [laughing]. When you go to the house 
he gonna crash on you everything [laughing]. He gonna ask you, “Why are you here?” Well, you come to work, 
eh? [Laughing] somebody who has dementia. “I don’t want you to come to the house.” You have to come here 
to ask, okay, [laughing]. Okay. I have a [inaudible], want to shopping. And I took him to shopping. We went to 
the store, and then we are looking for something. He didn’t find it. He was crashing at me [laughing], the 
crashing was, “What’s going on?” I said calm down. 
I: 
He was mad at you because he couldn’t find what he wanted at the store? 
P: 
[Laughing] he was just— 
I: 
And somebody else must have stepped in and said, “What’s going on?” 
P: 
“What’s going on?” 
I: 
‘Cause he was upset? 
P: 
I told him go sit down. I’m gonna find it, and you’re gonna pay, and we will go on. Okay. And the next 
time he said, “Oh, is why I want you to work for me because [laughing] you calm me. I got nervous. I don’t 
know how and why.” I said, yeah [21.11]. You are sick. You know you are sick. I have to understand everything 
from you [laughing], okay?  
I: 
So, you have this ability to calm people down and you’re patient, and that’s important in this job. 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
Right? So— 
P: 
Important. 
I: 
So, you’re explaining to me—I’m a young person, remember. I’m trying to decide if I want to be a 
personal care worker or not. 
P: 
And when you come to work, don’t think that house is your house. Don’t think—leave your phone in 
your car, please. Okay. If you bring your phone, you have to know somebody you work for, he don’t like the 
phone. “Why do you use the phone?” Put it back. Work your 2 hours. After 2 hours, you gonna take your phone 
and put anyplace you want. Okay. 
I: 
So, now I’m not a young person anymore. I am a legislator. Okay? 
P: 
Okay. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Therese Mukarushema. 7.7.18 
 
22
I: 
And I’m trying to figure out why this work—why we’re making such a big deal out of personal care 
work? Why is it so important? 
P: 
Today is me, tomorrow it will be you. Okay. Think about yourself. If you in this house, lay on your bed 
waiting somebody to come help you, that could happen to me or to you. That you do for me today, they will do 
for you tomorrow. Okay? Think about that. 
I: 
Okay. You’ve convinced me that it’s important. 
P: 
Yeah? 
I: 
What am I supposed to do about it? 
P: 
What are you supposed to do about it? They train you to help somebody, yeah. When you go to the 
house, think about what you’re gonna do. 
I: 
So, the legislator needs to know that personal care workers need training. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
So, I should authorize some money and create some training programs? 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
And what else? 
P: 
The pay [laughing]. Everything I told you, you have to see what job they do, and pay them. They give 
us money. Last time where is my money? And the money is going to the agency. I know that. Huh? The 
agency takes my money—they are for one lady. The money will go to the agency I work for. We never give me 
$1. They told me that. I’m not happy. If I quit that [17.53] job, the lady I work for will need me to work for her. 
Huh, but they will give her another one who don’t work—she don’t like. Hmm? Okay. Give me the money 
[laughing], I owed. 
I: 
You worked for it. You should be getting paid for it. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
Right. Is that what I’m hearing? 
P: 
Yes. Yes. 
I: 
So, we should be making sure you get paid more—the money comes to you, there are benefits, with 
training? 
P: 
With benefits. With training all the time. Yeah. And the meeting—the meeting to say what’s going on 
with this job too—yeah, something like that. 
I: 
The meeting? 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
Is that what you said? 
P: 
Yeah. Yeah. 
I: 
What do you mean by that? 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Therese Mukarushema. 7.7.18 
 
23
P: 
The meeting, when we have a meeting, we meet different people for [16.49] different houses, and we 
can share what we meet on our jobs. And we can study how to [inaudible] good does a problem we meet at the 
job. 
I: 
So, an agency meeting— 
P: 
Yes. Agency meeting. 
I: 
--where you learn about your client, and you talk to the other caregivers, so everybody  knows what’s 
going on? 
P: 
Yeah. We don’t say the client we work with, but we say the problem. We meet with the client. Yeah. 
I: 
So, when you’re meeting—you’re talking about meeting with your agency management? 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
Okay. So, the support from managers is very important? 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
Being able to communicate with them? 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
Okay. All right. Now, I’m not a politician anymore. 
P: 
[Laughing]. 
I: 
Now, I’m just your neighbor, I’m the public. You know, public doesn’t really get it. They don’t understand 
what you’re doing or why it’s important, so what would you like to tell the general public about your work? 
P: 
The general public they have a neighborhood [15.27]. That is first. 
I: 
Say it again? 
P: 
They have a neighborhood. 
I: 
A neighborhood. 
P: 
Yeah. A neighborhood. I think that is from the neighborhood. If we live across together, why don’t we 
know our neighbor? Why don’t we know that? That is first. Yeah. Those two I work for them, I was crossing all 
the time the one sit down in front of her house say and call to my client. One day she asked me, “Can you 
come to work for me?” I said who told you? “Your client told me. I see you all the time come in, come in, come 
in, and say me hi, is why I want you to come work for me.” That is the good neighborhood. That is the good 
neighborhood. If they don’t speak together, how can she know I’m working for her? Is that—I wish we can do in 
the neighborhood. They don’t need to go far away to ask me to come working for them, but themselves. They 
have to know one—each of the problem—one each other. 
I: 
So, we need more a sense of community— 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
And being able to take care of each other more? 
P: 
Yes. Yes. Yeah. And they know—that one knows how I work for her. The necessities to go to work for 
her, and knows her neighbor needs her for that too.

I: 
So, your reputation, word-of-mouth? 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
They know you’re good. They can trust you. 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
Because your neighbors recommended you. 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
Okay. ‘Cause trust must be really important. 
P: 
Important. 
I: 
For a job like this? 
P: 
Mmm hmm. Yeah. 
I: 
Can you—before we run out of time here, can you talk just a minute about the situation right now in the 
United States with immigration and refugees and, you know, so much diversity. You must have faced some of 
this yourself with clients who have a different heritage or culture? 
P: 
Oh, that is a big question. 
I: 
It’s a big question. I know. 
P: 
It’s a big question [12.39]. When we come in this country, we know each country. When we get there, 
we will have everything for free, okay, I think is [inaudible]. Everything for free. Maybe we think we will go to—
we will have a—I don’t know [laughing] how I can explain. When we got here, they bring somebody 
[inaudible]—went to school, who don’t know how to write and to read. That is visible. Okay. Who lives in a 
camp for 20 years. The camp is not—the camp— 
I: 
A refugee camp? 
P: 
A refugee camp for 20 years. They change—if you live you house, you change everything. You go 
down. Okay. They come in this country. You have to find a job in 3 months. You go to work. You don’t speak 
the language. You work with people you don’t know. The work is too hard. And they keep them in the school 
too. They have to train how to take a shower—every day to change the clothes every day. Like they parents— 
I: 
They have to learn how to do that themselves? 
P: 
Yes. Every day to use the deodorant, to use the washing, to comb the hair [laughing], to cook, how to 
make two meal for the family. 
I: 
So, the refugees that are coming here, they need to learn all of these things in order to get a job— 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
--and make it here? 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
Otherwise it’s too hard? 
P: 
It’s too hard. It’s too hard for them [10.25]. Is why you see—when they got money they give them 
money from in the beginning, a lot of money. The men they have to change. The men have to change. That

Therese Mukarushema. 7.7.18

from Africa. Africa, they drink, drink, drink all whole day. It’s the wife work and will do everything at home. The 
men when he got money, “Is my money. I have to buy beer.” The family start fighting, but that I like—the 
women, now, when they got in this country, they change. They know if they got a job, they know they have to 
open account and put money themselves. Otherwise, some men, they need money from the wife, and the 
money to put it together and to me a man in the house. We have to teach them [9.16], and to teach all the 
things they have to do, and it’s hard. 
I: 
And then once they know if they learn to do this, and they’re able to do the things they need to do in 
order to be successful and hold a job, get a job, then you face other difficulties as well with discrimination, 
and— 
P: 
Okay. Let me tell you what I didn’t tell you about when they start a job. They start the job, sometime 
they go to work with somebody, and he treat you like you are from the junk [laughing]. The junk in Africa. They 
ask you, “Did you live with animals?” 
I: 
Animals? 
P: 
Why animals? They ask me that question. 
I: 
A client? 
P: 
In your country— 
I: 
Clients have asked you that? 
P: 
No, no, no, no, no, no. At my job when I was housekeeping, they ask me that question [8.05]. 
Somebody will ask me that question. 
I: 
What did you say? 
P; 
I said the animals are in the park, and we have the houses we live in. I try to show him my house. This 
was my house I was to live in. Don’t think I didn’t go to school. I came here because I went to school. Yeah. 
You can—I was working with 11. I make a cake. I bring a piece of cake. I ask her to share with me. She said, 
“No.” I was thinking it was my friend, her. 
I: 
And she said no because? Why did she say no? 
P: 
No. We went—I brought the cake because we had the break. Okay. She was, “Bring something in. We 
share.” I said I make a cake. Can you take a small piece to people? I will make a cake. She said, “How did you 
cook it?” I started to explain her. She said, “No.” That was mean [laughing]. It was mean. 
I: 
You probably have a lot of stories like that? 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
Where people have—just they don’t understand. 
P: 
Yeah. It is why when at my job I decided to don’t talk to anybody. I said I don’t have any friend at my 
job. Okay. This is a break. I go there. I sit down there. Not talk to anybody. Yeah [laughing]. No. 
I: 
So, you face so many challenges with the language, with discrimination, with people like who you’ve 
been describing, who don’t understand. 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
Who maybe look down at you. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Therese Mukarushema. 7.7.18 
 
26
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
Is that right? 
P: 
Mmm hmm. Yeah. That happened to me. Who know how to dress up? Who know how to take a 
shower? Imagine somebody who don’t know how to comb her hair? How they are treated. Eh? Ha. 
I: 
I wish there was a way we could change that. 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
Teach people. 
P: 
I don’t know. Everybody are not the same. You will find somebody like when I got to my church. I found 
the people who loves me. Who loved me. 
I: 
So, you found support through your church family. 
P: 
Yeah. Yeah, but you can find [4.50]—I don’t know about on the job. Somebody who study high school, 
and you did high school, too, and he start to treat you like you didn’t go to school because of your language, 
because you don’t speak English right. If you don’t speak English right, you don’t know something? Huh? 
Yeah. 
I: 
And I’m guessing it’s not just the language, it’s the color of your skin. 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
It’s the fact that you’re from Africa. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. Yeah. Africa is a junk [laughing]. 
I: 
And people pass judgment based on those things alone. 
P: 
Yeah. Mmm hmm. 
I: 
Is that right? 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
Yeah. 
P: 
Maybe—I don’t know. I don’t know but is something in the mind. They have to clean the mind. When 
you meet somebody who was traveling alone, traveling everywhere, they are open. They know everything. 
Those are open. Those people who travel from the city to the city, no. They will never, never be open.  
I: 
Open-minded? 
P: 
Open-minded. 
I: 
Yes. 
P: 
No [laughing]. No. 
I: 
You know, I’m sorry that we’re almost out of time ‘cause I would love to keep talking, but in the last 
couple of minutes we have, and on the same subject, what would you like to say to everybody about what 
you’ve just been talking about? What do you want to say to the world about who you are, and the work that you 
do? 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Therese Mukarushema. 7.7.18 
 
27
P: 
Yeah. The first thing we need is love. If you have love, you don’t see the color. You don’t see—you see 
anybody like you love. Have love. If you love, everything will come. You will help anybody. You will go 
anywhere. You are not scared to go there, to go there because you love. Yeah. Ask your country to have love. 
The true—the true love. They will come at my house without the scared, and they will go there, no scared. This 
is a family. We have to live like family in this country. The country is for everybody, not for one person. Yeah. 
The job. Why do I have to go from the house to the house? Because I want to help. I need to help somebody. 
They can come help me like I help them, and we can work together, and the country will be a paradise. Mmm 
hmm. 
I: 
Well, those are great words of wisdom to end on. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
I want to thank you again for this interview. This has been marvelous. 
P: 
[Laughing]. 
I: 
Wonderful and inspirational, so you’re an inspiration. Thank you. 
P: 
Yeah. Thank you, too. Yeah. 
I: 
We’re going to stop and let K do his thing with the photographs. You can take that off now. 
I2: 
I’ll wrap up first then we can give you a second off camera, you know, [laughs]. 
P: 
[Laughing]. 
I2: 
Thank you. 
I: 
So, we’ll let you know— 
P: 
Can I give you a juice? You talk a lot. 
I: 
I was trying not to talk. 
P; 
[Laughing]. 
I: 
I told you I wanted you to do all the talking. No, thanks. I’m good. 
P: 
No water? 
I: 
No, thanks. No. 
P: 
How is that? You don’t wanna take anything in my house. 
I: 
No. I love your house. I love you, but I’m just not thirsty. 
P: 
Not thirsty. 
I: 
No. 
P: 
After 2 hours talking. 
I: 
No. I didn’t do all the talking. You did all the talking. Would you like some water? [group laughter]. 
P:
