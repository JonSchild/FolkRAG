LARRY TOOLEY. 
Mr. Larry Tooley, a 
star of unusual versatilit3 
is not 
only the German Comique—pt" excellence—of the Lmeri-
can stage. 
The greatest of all original Dutch vc ,alists, 
but is a ( lancer without an equal in the world 
3S.,. Too-
ley was born at Rhinebeck on the Hudson, in tn.., year 
eighteen hundred and forty-eight. 
Al an early y,ge be 
was sen t 
to -New York City as pprentice to a 
nitvennit-
ical instrument maker, but it was not long until be gave 
evidence that he was destined for a 
different spivre from 
the workshop. 
his first essay was as a 
dancer. The 
performance WziS a 
surprise, so totally unexpected by 
even his most intimate friend. 
Here was a 
comparative 
novice out-dancing and Wit- rivaling the hest irnown pro-
fessionals. 
And still they gazed, and still the wonder grew, 
That one pair of feet could do what his could dw 
He immediately embraced the stage as a 
profession, 
and cultivating his rich clear voice, soon became known 
as an artist unequaled in song and dance. 
In every 
city in the Union Mr. Tooley won fresh laurels, and be-
came one of the most attractiv performers on the stage. 
Longing for " fresh fields and pastures new," and having 
giver evidence of unusual ability in that direction, Mr. 
Tooley next appeared as a 
Dutch Comedian Vocalist, 
and in this line at one bound reached the highest pinna, 
ole. 
His original style, his perfect dialect, his inimita-
ble humor, his wonderful facial expression all tended 
towards his great success. 
Determined to keep up with 
the times, he seized upon every current topic as subjects 
for his songs. 
Every uew melody was caught, every new 
song parodied by him, and the result is, that Mr. Larry, 
Tooley to day stands at the very head of his profession, 
original, 
inimitable, alone the German Conlique Vo-
calist, actor, author and dancer of the period.

SAUERKRAUT STAMPER, 
Ant---"Minee Meat Chopper." 
I'LL sing you a 
song of Katrina Hoofmaut, 
Who makes sauerkraut, but never go out, 
She lives by her ladder, who weighs just about 
Three hundred and sixty-five pound. 
I

bull, 
And her ladder he don't like that suit, 
He ketched me one day and my hair he did pall 
Und busted me right of my snout.

KEIPIOODLE KERMOODLE KEN100, 
Sung by LARRY TOOLET. 
AIR—"Johnny come .,11arelting Home." 
I'LL sing to you of a 
big Nun, 
Choctaw! oh, law! 
He really was a 
number one, 
Oh, la! hi, yah 
You never heard such a 
terrible yaw, 
Or felt the weight of such a 
paw, 
Yet he dearly loved a 
little squaw 
Called Kermoodle Kermoodle Kemoo. 
[Repeat] 
'his Injun now was seven miles high 
I 
guess, more or less. 
His head it almost touched the sky, 
I 
guess, oh, yes! 
Ile jumped ten miles at a 
single bound, 
Although his feet weighed fifty pound, 
And he danced a 
jig when he heard the sound 
Of Kermoodle Kermoodle Kernoo. 
[Repeat.] , 
Kermoodle she loved her big Injun 
With regard, so hard! 
That she and he agreed to be one, 
All right! that night! 
But up came a 
soldier all in blue, 
And shot Mr. Injun through and through, 
Till he yelled out hoop-de-dooden-doo, 
At Kermoodle Kermoodle Kemoo. 
[Repeat.) 
The Injun did the bucket kick, 
The shct made him drop, 
Kermoodle cried ' till she was sick, . 
All wet with regret.  
She saw the Injun under ground all right, 
Then gave a 
scream with all her might, 
And married the soldier out of spite, 
Did Kermoodle Kermoodle Kemoo,

AS SWEET P
AS A 
ROSE IS SHE, 
Poetry by nom NEwcomri. 
AS sweet as the rose is she, 
So charming in form and in pace, 
Her eyes they have pierced my heart through, 
And I 
constantly dream of her face. 
He voice is as clear as the lark, 
That sings with the rising of the day, 
Her breath is as fragrant and sweet 
As the white blossomed flowers of May. 
CHORUS. 
As sweet as the rose is she, 
Her eyes they sparkle bright, 
Fairer than all to me, I 
think of her day and night, 
There's none in this world so wide, 
Could be the same to me, 
As the girl I'd call my bride, 
As sweet as a 
rose is she. 
is.s sweet ag a 
rose is she, 
The girl who has won all my love, 
I'd willingly sacrifice life, 
To call her my own turtle dove. 
But she laughs in my face when I 
speak, 
And when I 
make love says " I 
shan't," 
Then tells m e 
I 
must her forget, 
And I 
would, but then really I 
can't. 
As sweet as the rose, &c. 
As sweet as a 
rose is she, 
The girl for whese hand I 
have sighed, 
The wealth of the world I 
would give, 
If only to call her my bride. 
I 
hope I 
may yct win her hand, 
That would make me so happy for life, 
If I 
do, when I 
meet you again, 
Then perhaps I 
will show you my wife, 
As sweet as the rose, &c.

YOU KNOW WHAT I 
KNOW. 
Sting by LARRY TOOLEY. 
KNOW something which I 
don't mind telling you. 
But keep it a 
secret, now mind, 
Because if my wife was to find it out too, 
I 
know that with rage she'd go blind. 
It's about a 
young girl what I 
met the other day, 
While walking along in the street, 
And I 
know if this young girl knowed I 
had a 
wife, 
She would'nt think I 
was sweet. 
CHORES. 
Now you know what I 
know and what my wife don't know. 
She don't know what Lknow, and what I 
know you know. 
If you tell her what you know and also what I 
know, 
Then she'd know what'I know, what you know also. 
I 
know that this young girl wore lots of false hair, 
I 
could see that at once at a 
glance, 
I 
know that her feet were much larger than mine, 
I 
found dat out when we did dance. 
She got beauty spots all over her face— 
I 
don't want to make fun at all, 
She'd a 
mole on her cheek as large as a 
beet, 
And it looked like a 
big cod- fish ball. 
Now you know, ez.c. 
This girl's hair was red or a 
strawberry blonde, 
Tier eyebrows hung down to her nose, 
She had a 
mouth when open looked like a 
mouse trap, 
It worked on a 
spring, I 
suppose. 
But still she's a 
beauty longside of my wife, 
To-morrow I'll get a 
divorce, 
And the result I 
don't mind telling you, 
I 
marry this young girl of course.

OH, here I

CHORUS,

To practice we do meet.

Mit Bendie's Deitcher's band.

Here comes that Bendie's Deitcher's band, 
Der bulliest band what's out.

NEVER LOSE YOUR GRIP, 
As sung by L
ARRY TooLzY. 
AS through the world in search of pleasure, 
We wander boys together. 
We're knocked about, up and down, but 
The storm of life we weather, 
Some there are who don't succeed, and but 
And let their chances slip, 
Take my advice, you'll find I'm right, 
Boys never lose your grip. 
When courting be the man throughout: 
And if your girls inclined 
To act the flirt, why shut your eyes, 
Her little faults don't mind, 
Don't act the fool, be true to her, and 
Darn it, let her rip, 
If she cares a 
cent for you, my boy, 
You'll never lose your grip. 
When you meet a 
skunk, pass him by, but 
Remember at some time, 
That to be hard up, is no sin, and poverty no crime, 
And when a 
friend is in distress, why 
Your hands in pocket dip, 
And until you find a 
stamp my boy, 
Why never lose your grip. 
When going home late at night, 
Look out for an attack, 
It happens oft a 
loafer steals like, o. 
Sneak behind your back, 
PAnch him well, he'll give you no 
Chance, and quickly give the trip, 
And:until he kisses mother earth, boys, 
Never lose your grip.

DUTCH POLICEMAN, 
As sting by LARRY Toonar. 
I'M a 
policeman you see, 
I 
know every lady, 
That is, what lives round on my beat, 
I'm the pet of the force, 
But you know me that of course, 
And the ladies say I 
look so neat, 
I 
tried to look grave, 
But then I 
am lame, 
And can get away too with the boys, 
That is if they are small, 
And not very tall, 
When I 
catch them a 
making a 
noise. 
CHORUS. 
And when I'm on my beat, 
With my club so neat 
That goes rat, tat, tat, tat. & c., &c., 
I 
lick all the small boys, 
When they make a 
noise, 
And make them all slip away from me. 
The other day about two. 
I 
was passing through 
street that is known to you all. 
A man with a 
crutch, 
When he hollored out watch ; 
And a 
woman did cry out and bawl, 
I 
stopped the fight quick, 
With the aid of my stick, 
When a 
fellow what did weigh a 
ton. 
Said go way do you hear, 
And hit me in the ear, 
So I 
thought I'd let the fight go on. 
And when I'm, ace.

UNDER THE DAISIES. 
I'VE just been learning the lesson of II fe, 
The sad, sad lesson of loving, 
And all of its powers for pleasure Or pain 
Been slowly and sadly proving ; 
And all that's left of the bright, bright dream, 
With its thousand and brilliant phases, 
Is a 
handful of dust, in a 
coffin hid— 
A 
coffin under the daisies, 
The beautiful, beautiful daisies, 
The snowy, snowy daisies. 
And thus forever throughout this wide world, 
Is love a 
sorrow proving, 
There are still many sorrowful things in life, 
But the saddest of all is loving; 
The life of some is worse than Death, 
For fate a 
high wall oft raises, 
And far better than life with two hearts estranged, 
Is a 
low grave stared with daisies, 
The beautlful, beautiful daisies, 
The snowy, snowy daisies. 
And so ' tis better we liv'd as we did, 
The summer of love together, 
And that one of us tired and lay down to rest 
Ere the corning of wintry weather; 
For the saddest of love is love grown cold, 
And 'tis one of Its surest phases, 
So I 
bless my _ot, though with breaking heart, 
For that grave enstared with daisies, 
• 
The beautiful, beautiful daisies, 
The snowy, snowy daisies. '

SPEAK OUT LIKE A 
MAN, 
THOUGH you gentlemen are smiling, 
It's very plain to me, 
But most of you are single, 
Which of course ought not to be, 
There's girls I'm sure in plenty, 
Who would your happiness advance, 
By wedding you to morrow 
If they only had a 
chance. 
CHORUP. 
Then don't be shy, for single life's a 
sin, 
Fair lady, as the proverb says. 
Faint heart did never win. 
Then don't be shy, but do the best you can, 
And when you go a 
courting, 
Why, speak out like a 
man. 
When at your kind attentions, 
We appear to take offense, 
Pray don't be disconcerted 
That's merely a 
pretence. 
If to wring your ears we threates 
We, of course, mean no such thing, 
It's merely a 
suggestion, 
We ourselves should like a 
ring. 
Then don't be shy, etc. 
Now you gentlemen attention, 
If you'd happy be for life, 
Don't live in single wretchedness, 
But quickly take a 
wife. 
There's a 
funny man sitting there, 
Like one upon the shelf, 
To set you an example, 
I'll make love to him myself. 
...... Then don't be shy, ite.

DON'T GO, MOLLIE DARLING, 
Music by J. WHITMORE. 
OH! Mollie, darling, the anchor is weighed 
The ship is now toady to sail o'er the sea, 
Each moment is precious, and time will not wait, 
Oh ! Mollie, my treasure, do listen to me; . 
You're going far away from kindred and friends, 
Off to the land that is far o'er the foam, 
We've no one but you to gladden our hearts— 
Don't leave us, Mollie, sweet light of our home. 
CHORUS. 
Don't cross the sea, Mollie, and leave us alone, 
For dreary our beautiful home then will be. 
We've no one to care for but you, Mollie dear, 
Don't leave us, darling. 
Oh 1 
listen to me. 
Oh ! Mollie, my darling, your father is ill, 
But still he has come down to see you depart. 
Ile stands by your side in our sorrow and pain, 
And tears tell the anguish that lies in his heart, 
Oh ! come to my arms, let me fold you again, 
Close to the heart that is throbbing for thee, 
Remember the days wheni sang you to sleep, 
Don't leave us, Mollie, to cross the blue sea. 
Don't cross the sea, Mollie, tic. 
Ohl Mollie, my darling, say what will you do, 
Alone in a 
land where but strangers abide, 
No kind words you'll hear of advice, Mollie dear, 
But ah ! many evils will lurk at your side; 
Let me kiss you, perhaps for the last time on earth, 
For we are old, and our days arc but few, 
There's tears in your eyes, I 
sco you'll not go— 
kleav'n pour sweet blessings, dear Mollie, on you. 
Don't cross the sea, Mollie, &c.

SWELLS OF THE 00EANt' 
I 
HAVE been down to Rockaway, 
I've dipped in the sea, 
I 
have dived at the waves, and have swam from the shore, 
And have laughed with delight that my limbs they were free 
The swells of th-3 ocean to carry me o'er. 
But when I 
returned to my bathing machine, 
And have dre,ss'd and emerged on the pebbly strand, 
Oh! what a 
different swell have I 
seen, 
What a 
different swell have I 
grasped by the hand. 
You may grasp by the hand, boys, 
But keep yor hearts free, 
From the swells on the shore, 
By the side of the sea. 
There's a 
swell on the shore looking out for a 
bride, 
For he knows, cunning dog, why the girls are brought down:, 
And I'm sorry to say, when he tries the seaside, 
The mammas are more verdant then they were in town. 
He ogles an heiress; ma' sanctions the match, 
And all in a 
season the mischief is done; 
But silly mamma finds, too late, that her " catch"_ 
Was a 
roue in town and a 
prodigal son. 
Oh! silly mammas, 
Let you daughters go free 
From the wily embrace 
Of such swells of the sea. 
There's a 
swell on the shore, who's down for a 
week, 
And he says for eleven weeks more he'll remain; 
He has travelled to Rockaway his pleasure to seek, 
And he's not in a 
hurry to leave it again. 
He's a 
swell, who at home was a 
wine merchant's clerk, 
With a 
hundred a-year, and spent live hundred a-day; 
So he went to the Bankruptcy Court " for a 
lark "— 
His " protection " postponed, and he's " out of the way." 
And instead of a 
prison-yard, 
Here he walks free, 
'Mongst the swells on 
shore 
By the side of the sex.

THE TWINS. 
ENT term and features, face and limb 
I 
grew so like my brother. 
That folks got taking me for him. 
And each for one another; 
It puzzled all our kith and kin 
And reached a 
frightful pitch. 
For one of us was born a 
twin. 
But not a 
soul knew which. 
One day, to make the matter worse, 
Before our names were fixed, 
As we were being washed by nurse 
We got completely mixed; 
And so you see by fate's decree. 
Or rather nurse's whim, 
My brother John got christened me 
And I 
got chriF:tened him. 
This fatal likeness even dogged 
My footsteps when at school— 
And I 
was always being flogged, 
For John turned out a 
fool ! 
I 
put this question fruitlessly, 
To every one I 
knew, 
What would you do if you were me 
To prove that you were you. 
This sad resemblance turned the tide 
Of my domestic life, 
And somehow my intended bride 
Became my brother's wife; 
In fact, year after year this same 
Absurd mistake went on, 
And when I 
died. the neighbors came 
And burled—brother John,

MASTER TOMMY WHATTLE 
And the Big Blue Bottle. 
ABOUT a 
year, or two, or three, or four, or five ago, 
Thore . h-ed a 
wealthy family, residing down at Bow 
They kept a 
footman and a 
cook, a 
page and many ahem 
They'd fourteen aunts, six uncles, seven sisters and eight bro-
thers. 
()nouns. 
Oh! Master Whattle, naughty Master Whattle, 
Why did you go and kill that big blue-bottle? 
They all were handsome children, but his mother's hope and joy. 
Was Tommy Whattle, aged five, a 
darling little boy; 
He'd learnt to read, and write, anti sing his do, re, nil, sol, fit. 
And though he always cross'd his 4. 
t's" he never cross'd his ma. 
Oh! Master, & c. 
ile'd take his powders minus jam, and went to bed at night 
And never se,em'd at all put out when nurse put out the light; 
But children have their weaknesses, however much you chide 
'em, 
And Tommy's was for killing flies, he never could abide ' em. 
Oh! Master, Ac. 
The dragon and the blue-tail fly were his especial horror, 
And though he killed one ev'ry day, ite brother came to-morrow. 
46 
lioase-flies he'd scrunch by hundreds, ton, this naughty Tommy 
Whattle, 
Until one day ho chanced to slay a 
monstrous big blue-bottle. 
Oh ! Master. &. c.. 
The blue- bottle's' the King of the flies, as all of you may guess. 
A crowning triumph, Tommy thought. this was to his success, 
For not a 
single fly appeared again. Fve heard it said, 
until that dreiidful night, when little Tommy wont to bed. 
Oh ! Master, 
de'd gone to sleep rejoicing, too, that wicked little pickle. 
But something settled on his nose, and woke him with its tickle; 
A 
horrid buzzing noise he heard—the flies had come in hosts, 
At least they couldn't conic themselves, and so they sent their 
ghosts. 
Oh! Master, & c. 
Some had no legs, and some no heads, no bodlei and no wings, 
And TOIll repented very much he'd done such wicked things; 
They fell upon him, headed by the monstrous big blue-bottle, 
And flew away with him—and there's an end to Tommy Whattle. 
Oh! Master, S:c. 
MORAL. 
Now little children, aged four, or five, or six, or eight, 
Don't kill the flies, or you may meet with Tommy Whattle's fate, 
The world is big enough for all, to live in and to thrive, 
Then buy a 
penny fly-paper, and catch 'em all alive. 
Oh! Master, & c.

THE PIG-NIC PARTY, 
OF all the pleasures on this earth, 
For fun, and frolic joy ; and mirth, 
Laughing, riding, walking, talking, 
Give me a 
pic-nic party. 
Girls so pretty, men so witty, 
Rushing from the crowded city. 
List, I 
pray, to this my ditty, 
About the plc-nic party. 
So lets be merry and contrive 
how to keep the game alive, 
On fun and frolic let us thrive, 
At this our pic-nic party. 
Now there's the dinner on the grass... 
The spread, the knives, and forks, and glaAs, 
With pigeon pies and joints en maw, 
To feed the pic-nic. 
party. 
Tis true they leave the salt behind, 
The corkscrew they can never find, 
But to complain ' twould be unkind. 
So everybody says " Never mind," 
Now all are seated, they begin, 
When shrieks are heard, a 
horrid din, 
For a 
nest of ants they're sitting in. 
Oh, the joys of a 
plc-rile party.

THE YOUNG CHAP DRESS'D IN BLUE. 
THE VILLAGE_CLOCK; 
I'LL tell you a 
tale about Dorothy Vale 
A 
cook in Grosvenor Square, 
Who fell in love with a 
fine young man, 
Who'd about his face much hair. 
His eyes they were of a 
gooseberry int, 
'Tis as well to tell to you, 
With a 
slight proclivity to a 
squint, 
And he wore a 
suit of blue. 
Crionrs. 
He was a 
fine man, fol de diddle I 
do 
He was a 
fine man tol de riddy eh! 
He was a 
fine man, fol de diddle I 
do, 
He was a 
fine man, fol de diddle day. 
On his collar there was a 
number 
On his arm there was a 
band, 
And as he walk'd with a 
stately step, 
No one looked half so grand. 
The little boys with their kites and hoops, 
From him like wild fire flew, 
While cookey would band up the mutton chops, 
To this young chap dress'd in blue. 
He was a 
fine man, &c. 
The magistrate committed him, 
The cookey lost her place ; 
But the cabby shortly married her, 
To kiver her disgrace; 
The poor policeman got six years, 
Penal servitude to do; 
So that's all J 
know of the cabby, the cook, 
And the young chap dress'd in blue, 
iNrho was a 
fine man, &c. 
THE village clock is striking eightl 
As the misty twilight closes, 
And some one stands in the cottage porch, 
Under the clustering roses; 
And ever she gages down the road, 
Her young heart anxiously beating; 
" 
Why stays he 80 late" thinks she, 
Her lips each stroke of the clock repeating 
" 
Why stays he so late" thinks she, 
Her lips each stroke of the clock repeating. 
The village clock is striking ten 
While two 'neath the roses linger, 
And something bright in the fair moonlight, 
Shines on the maiden's finger; 
And whispers the youth " to morrow morn" 
As he bids good-bye in the door way: 
Oh! hasten thy coming, happy dawn, 
There shall some one be waking before ye 
Oh! hasten thy coming, happy dawn, 
There shall some one be waking before ye.

SONG OF SONGS 
I 
DREAMT I 
dwelt in marble halls, 
With the dark girl dress'd in blue; 
And did'ut she seem to like it. 
Where early fails the dew 
My pretty Jane, my dearest Jane 
I 
likes a 
drop o' good beer, 
Then pour out the Rhine wine, 
For I 
am a 
muleteer, 
Then pour out the Rhine wine, 
For I 
am a 
muleteer. 
Sweet spirit hear my pray'r, 
In the cottage by. the sea ; 
And in such a 
moment I 
but ask 
That you'll remember me. 
Come where my love lies dreaming, 
Far, far upon the sea ; 
I'm a 
young man from the country, 
But you don't get over me, 
I'm a 
young man from the country, 
But you do not swindle me. 
Come into the garden, Maud, 
Under the old oak tree; 
For no one knows a 
father's love, 
But impudent Barney O'Hea; 
Then nil desperandum, I'll never despair 
For the love of Nancy Till, 
But I'll hang my harp on a 
willow tree, 
A 
way down Holborn Hill. 
But I'll hang my harp on a 
willow tree, 
A 
way down Holborn HilL

STANDING AT THE GATE WITH ADA. 
ONE summer night some time ago, when birds had gone to 
sleep, 
And little stars at heaven's gate came out to wink and peep; 
The lilies and the pretty flowers wafted sweet perfume, 
A 
shepherd's pipe was heard afar, to play this pretty tune. 
ClIORT'S. 
While standing at the gate with Ada, 
While standing at the gate with Ada, 
While standing at the gate with Ada, 
One evening rather late. 
r 
press'd her hand beneath the tree, the lilac kissed her cheek, 
Her pouting lips were just apart, her sigh was soft and sweet; 
The odor of her balmy breath was like sweet Indian spice, 
stole a 
sweet enchanting kiss, I 
might have stole it thrice. 
While standing at the gate with Ada, & c. 
A. naughty bee out rather late, that moment by me flew, 
And his style quite plainly told he had been drinking dew; 
So deeming us too near his house, my cheek he quickly stung 
And as he flew into his hive right merrily he sung. 
While standing at the gate with Ada, &c. 
I 
bade my love a 
sweet good night, the hour was growing late, 
She press'd her lips against my cheek, and closed the wicket 
crate • 
Click, went the latch, the door it creaked, I 
sighed, good night 
fair maid, 
And to my love my own fond dove, I 
breathed this serenade, 
I'm waiting at the gate for Ada, &c.

THE YOUNG MEN OF THE DAY. 
I'M a 
young man of the present day, 
And the fashion has created--
Many men like me, as you will say, 
Tho' not so bad as stated. 
About the little village I 
can find my way, 
And I'm very seldom seen inebriated, 
Tho' a 
fast young man of the present day, 
Of the present, of the present day. 
CHORUS. 
For I 
am a 
young man of the present day, 
Tho' I'm not so bad as some people say; 
If I 
drink, and I 
smoke, and I 
dance and play, 
I'm not such a 
bad one for all that. 
Now and then at Billiards I've a 
spin, 
In a 
Theatre oft am seen, o' 
At Music-Halls sometimes I 
look in, 
Or else at the Casino. 
A 
little recreation in the dancing way, 
Is enjoyed with a 
zest so very keen o' 
By the fast young men of the present day; 
Of the present, of the present day. 
For I 
am, Ac. 
53 
I 
and myself in togs and tiles, 
My ties and crabs providin', 
And if I 
have to go two milos— 
A 
handsome cab I 
ride in; 
rho cost of washing linen I 
of course defray, 
For a 
nobby-looking shirt, I 
take pride in, 
Like the other young men of the preseut day; 
Of the present, of the present day. 
For I 
am, kr,. 
They say that I've a 
wish to roam, 
And that I 
avoid as blisters,— 
My Pa and Ma, also my home, 
My brothers and my sisters. 
To stay out half the night, I 
am inclined, they say, 
That my manners altogether are remiss, sirs, 
Like the other young men of the present day. 
Of the present, of the present day. 
For I 
am, &A, 
Now, as my faults to you I've told, 
Or, of what my friends accuse me; 
To ask a 
favor I 
make bold, 
And know you'll not refuse me, 
Be a 
little lenient to me, I 
pray, 
For what I 
have done was only to amuse ye 
As a 
fast young man of the present day 
Of the present, of the present day. 
For I

IT PLEASES BOTH OLD AND YOUNG, 
It is a Fac simile of a Trick practiced by cal 
the .Professors of Magic. 
It is arranged so systematically, and is accom-
panied with directions so plainly written, that, with 
a 
single perusal, any person may become an adopt 
in an unfailing source of amusement. 
Read what a leading journal says of it: 
" 
An ingenious little book of the thaumaturgic order 
has been sent us, called ' Humer3t DIIMPTY,' and bound 
in such a 
way as to give opportunity for a 
decidedly' 
puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary appear-
ance of a 
child's picture-book, gayly printed and colored, 
it is so bound that a 
practiced manipulator, taking it 
up, and flirting the leaves rapietly over, can make it ap-
pear to be filled with copies of only one picture, or with 
blank pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of 
figures. 
One minute the pamphlet, quickly thumbed, 
appears to contain nothing but portraits of Harlequin, 
in his tesselated suit; the next, only Columbine; then, 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or Mephisto-
pheles. 
A little practice, and the directions printed 
with the book will make anybody at home in the hand-
ling of it."--Phila. Evening Bultelizt.)

The New 
York Evening Mail writes: 
A 
little book has lately appeared in print at Messrs. Fisher it 
Denison's, 98 Nassau street, called " The Little Flirt." We cannot 
say that we recommend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, 
as we think it would only encourage the bad h- bit of "flirting." 
-Unfortunately there is enough of it done without any further neces-
sity of explaining "how, when and where to do it," and this little 
volume would advise and initiate the uncorrupted in practising what 
is commonly called "flirting." 
The N. Y. Evening Telegram writes: 
We have lately seen a 
neat little book, bound in morocco, coating 
26 cents, called "The Little Flirt," published by Messrs. Fisher & 
Denison, 98 Nassau street. 
It gives information of the modus oper-
andi of flirLng„ and of the meaning of every motion of the hand-
kerchief, fan, glove and parasol. As there is nothing at all objec-
tionable in the volume, and its contents might afford some innoceut 
amusement to many, we do not hesitate to TeC0111111ella it to 
young lady and gentlemen readers. 
The LITTLE FLIRT contains Fourteen Silhouette Dins, 
trations. 
Is bound with bevelled edges and gilt sides,
