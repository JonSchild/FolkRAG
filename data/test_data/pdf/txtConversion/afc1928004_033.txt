A 
Congo Song. 
Written for TONY PASTOR. 
Ant—" Chanting Benny." 
Of novelty this is the age, 
It matters not what it is, 
But albums now are all the rage, 
Filled up with Cartes de Visite. 
I 
looked in one—'t 
was neatly bound. 
And filled with art's creations— 
And men and women there I 
found 
In curious situations. 
Chorus. 
But things will get mixed up, you know, 
Though small mistakes we call ' em, 
In putting Cartes de Visites in 
A 
fashionable album. 
There Edwin Forrest first I 
saw, 
Stuck close to Julia Daly, 
And Laura Keen under George Law, 
Mrs. Stowe with Horace Greeley, 
Dan Bryant over Ellen Grey, 
You'd really ought to seen 'em 
And Adah Menkin, young and gay, 
Was next to Johnny Heenan. 
THE CARTE DE VISITE ALBUM. 
I WOULD NOT BE A BABY, 
7 
For things will get mixed up, you know, 
But small mistakes we call 'em, 
In putting, etc. 
Then famous Doctor Tumblety,. 
The knight of pill and pestle, 
Stuck in a 
corner there you'd see 
Along with Madam Restell. 
Young Booth just by young Cora Hatch, 
He cut a 
pretty figure; 
With Wendell Philipps sticking to 
A 
woolly female nigger. 
For things, etc. 
Fernando Wood and Fanny Fern 
Were in a 
corner shady, 
While Gideon Welles his turn came next, 
Close to the famed ' French Lady.' 
Then " Barnum's giant," gaily dressed, 
A 
monster huge and fat, he, 
Although much larger than the rest, 
Was next to little Patti. 
For things, etc. 
Our army, too, the honor shared 
From general to sutler: 
There was old blackguard Beauregard 
Put under General Butler ; 
There was Johnston, Yancey, Toombs and Lee 
And Wise, so famed for drinking. 
But over this " rogues gallery " 
Was honest old Abe Lincoln. 
For things, etc. 
There was Colonel Ellsworth, hero true, 
Columbia's martyred son, sir, 
With Lyon, Lander, Sedgwiek, too, 
Along with Washington, sir. 
There was Jeff Davis and the crowd 
Who now his staff is swelling, 
And all stuck where they soon will be 
Under our own brave Sherman. 
For mighty soon our nation's space 
He'll free from rebel thralldom, 
And traitors then shall have 'no place 
In Uncle Sam's big album. 
I 
WOULD NOT BE A 
BABY. 
As 
sung by TONY PASTOR. 
A nt—" I'd choose to be a 
Baby." 
I 
wished to be a 
baby, 
I've changed my mind since then; 
I've been a 
baby "once, 
But never wish to be again. 
The girls would haul and maul me 
And over me would chat, 
But when you're but a 
baby 
Now what's the use of ithat. 
Chorus. 
I 
would not be a 
baby, 
With a 
temper sweet or sour, 
A 
squalling little monkey, 
Not even for an hour. 
They'd souse me in cold water, 
No matter how I'd cry, 
And cover me with powder 
To keep my body dry; 
• 
Then wrap a 
cloth about it 
To keep my clothing clean, 
With the pin a-sticking in me 
. My little legs between. 
I 
would not, etc. 
And if into a 
crying pitch 
I 
chanced to raise my pipes, 
The nurse would tell my mamma 
That " The baby's got the gripes." 
8 
-SARAH'S YOUNG MAN. 
They'd give me nasty physic, 
Catnip and jalap teas, 
With a 
teaspoon full of castor-oil 
To give the baby ease. 
I 
would not, etc. 
And when I'd take the physic, 
How nasty I 
would4e1 
Until the nurse had washed me 
From my head down to. my heel, 
Then she'd put me in the cradle 
With a 
kiss upon my brow, 
And leave me sleeping all alone--
That wouldn't suit me now. 
I 
would not, etc. 
SARAH'S YOUNG MAN. 
As sung with rapturous applause by TONY PASTOR.. 
Ais—" Kitty of Coleraine," or " Jenny Jones." 
My first love was Sarah. 
0 
none could be fairer, 
Than she was, in fact I've ne'er seen one so fair._ 
On her I 
got love-
si
ck, she was 
a domestic, 
And lived at a 
mansion in Madison square. 
I 
ne'er shall forget her, the first time I 
met her, 
As she out of the house for the dinner beer ran; 
It was love at first sight, for on the same night, 
I 
with joy was accepted as Sarah's young man., 
I 
oft got invited to tea, and delighted 
I 
felt at the welcome she always gave me. 
While sipping our Souchong we'd talk of affection, 
And how I 
enjoy'd the hot muffins for tea. 
The servants were Sukey, a 
very fat Cookey; 
Jemima the housemaid, and kitchen riNid Fan, 
As one may suppose, they all had their beaux, 
But no one was favor'd like Sarah's young man. 
SARAH'S YOUNG MAN. 
Unexpected one night, I 
call'd, when a 
sight 
Met rriy view, that I 
scarce could believe my own eyes, 
But alas, 'twas too true, thiere a 
horse guard in blue 
Sat quite cosy with Sarah, who star'd with surprise. 
And when I 
demanded a 
true explanation 
Of such heartless conduct, Miss Sarah began 
To laugh, and grew bolder, while her great clumsy soldier 
Seiz'd hold of the collar of Sarah's young man. 
Said he coolly to me, " You're not wanted, you see, 
If you'll quietly take my advice you'll walk out." 
Said I, " if I 
do, by Jove, you'll go too ;" 
When the monster began for to knock me about. 
While struggling we both heard the voice of her master, 
The soldier with fright up the area steps ran, 
While I 
soon as able crawled under the table, 
A 
nice situation for Sarah's young man. 
Well, down came her master, but before him much faster, 
Came a 
nasty black poodle, who scampered about. 
I 
trembled with fear whene'er it came near, 
And dreaded its finding my hiding place out 
My breathing I 
smothered, but alas was discovered, 
For the poodle a 
sniffing and barking began, 
Then quickly he lifted the cloth from the table, 
And dragged out from under it Sarah's young man. 
My feelings that moment I 
cannot describe them, 
My looks I 
am sure must have been most absurd, 
I 
glanced at my captor, then trembled and stammer'd, 
Thil trying to speak, I 
could not say a 
word. 
Then straightway he tighten'd his hold of my collar, 
Saying, " Who and what are you, speak out if you can, 
A 
thief or a 
lover?" 
Said I 
with a 
stutter, 
" 
No, no, no, if you please sir, I'm Sarah's young man." 
I 
gave to her master all due explanation, 
He then let me go, and thus ended my fright. 
Miss Sarah of course she lost her situation, 
And also her soldier, which serv'd her quite right.

THE ORGAN GRINDER. 
The last time we met, she was full of regret, 
And said, " Oh, forgive me this once if you can," 
But, said I, " Oh no, fools ofteli fall 'tween two stoo/s, 
And I'm happy I'm no longer Sarah's young man." 
THE ORGAN GRINDER. 
As sung with rapturous applause by Toxr Pearoa. 
Ant--" Paddy Casey." 
You see before you a 
young man 
Who mourns both night and day, 
For the loss of a 
pretty girl named Fan, 
Who has stolen my heart away. 
She said she loy'd me faithfully, 
And vowed we ne'er should part, 
But she's gone away with an organ man, 
And broken this poor heart—hetIrt--heart. 
So I 
mourns for the loss of the girl I 
Jove, 
And I 
don't know where to find her; 
She's gone away from her turtle dove, 
With a 
nasty organ grinder. 
(Spoken.)—And so young, too. 
In a 
brown-stone house up in Union square, 
She lived a 
chamber-maid ; 
Seven dollars a 
month, and all she could find 
Was the salary she got paid. 
Oh, how often down those area steps 
I've crept like an old Tom cat, 
And after having a 
good blow out, 
I've till'd my poor old hat—hat—hat. 
(Spoken.)—You should have seen her! 
Out of all the servants in the square 
She used to take the shine; 
She'd a 
delicate turn in her anclo, 
And a 
great big crinoline. 
THE ORGAN GRINDER. 
11 
When she used to clean the front door steps, 
How the chaps they used to stare. 
And throw sheep's eyes and heave big sighs, 
Which made me tear my hair—hair—hair. 
(Spoken.)-0b, what depravity ! 
Now, I 
Soon began to notice—that 
Whenever I 
pass'd that way, 
There was always an organ grinder there 
A 
grinding " Old Dog Tray." 
He'd grind and grind, until he found 
He couldn't grind any more ; 
And when they told him to move on, 
He'd go and grind next door— to be sure. 
(Spoken.)— And, Oh! so young ! 
Now one day ' Fan' asked this organ man 
To play her " Uncle Sam ;" 
She gave him coppers in return, 
And a 
plate of cold roast lamb.' 
Then he told her he was of noble blood, 
And would be a 
marquis one fine day; 
In fact he told such thund'ring lies, 
That with him she eloped away—that day. 
(Spoken.)—She ought to have known better. 
Well, the last time I 
heard of the happy pair, 
"I' was in Baxter Avenue ; 
The felloW was grinding on his instrument of torture, 
And Fan play'd the ?Old Barkio.4, 
But to mourn any more for a 
girl like that, 
I 
should only be a 
dunce; 
So I'll think no more of Fan and her organ man, 
But hope they'll get six months. 
(Spoken.)— With hard labor, for disturbing skyen-
tifie pursuits and mental miscalculations. 
So no more I'll mourn for the girl I 
loved, 
And no more I'll try to find her; 
She may go and be blowed for what I 
care, 
Yes and so may her organ grinder. 
THE ILL'KERVED ORGAN-MAN. 
THE ILL-SERVED ORGAN:MAE. 
.A Reply to " The Organ Grinder." 
As sung by TONY PASTOR. 
Abused I 
have been much of late 
About some pretty Fan, 
And how that she was stolen 
By a 
nasty Organ Man. 
The Public point, and say ' tis me, 
Prove it if they can; 
Before you stands now what they call 
The nasty Organ Man. 
But pity the poor Organ Grinder pray, 
And assist him if you can, 
From country- and friends. far far away 
Is the ill- served Organ Man. 
My wife I 
love, and that's the truth, 
Of course I 
mean my Fan, 
Yes, and in spite of the dirty youth 
Don't despise this Organ Man, 
For love, true love she me did wed, 
It shows a 
woman can 
Love deep and true, affection show 
For the ill-served Organ Man. 
The time is come, alas! alas! 
Sorry am I 
to say, 
Our living, through one Mr. Bass, 
Is taken now away. 
For we the police in charge will takt: 
And our Organs too. 
And if my instrument they take, 
For Pan what can I ? 
Music, charms it does po9se.7s 
In drawing room, or strs?.et. 
The Organ by the poor is thought 
.But a 
harmless treat. 
Then why, I 
ask, street music stop, 
Where the greater fault, . 
An Organ Man his music grind, 
Or Taylor to grind his malt. 
The poor men study not at all, 
That you can't deny, 
And servants too, now we are stopped, 
Will often heave a 
sigh. 
.Perhaps a 
nuisance I 
may be, 
To you now I 
will say, 
A Policeman I 
can smell somewhere, 
So I 
must move away. 
Encore. 
That I 
have pleased you one and all, 
Your applause to gain, 
Much pleasure gives the Organ Man 
To come and grind again. 
My study will be all to please, 
In return you can 
Your patronage each night bestow 
To hear the Organ Man. 
As sung by TONY PASTOR. 
Antr ." Go it while you're young." 
Oh! shouldn't I 
like to glt fat, 
I 
can't and cannot tell why, 
I 
am getting as thin as a 
rat, 
And I 
eat till I 
burst pretty nigh, 
I 
ain't got no weights on my mind, 
On my belly I 
spends all my tin, 
Enough grub I 
never can find, 
And I'm getting so remarkable thin. 
1 
Chorus. 
Oh shouldn't I 
like to get fat, 0 
my! 
Oh ! shouldn't I 
like to get fat, (Repeat.) 
14 
SHOULDN'T I LIKE TO GET FAT. 
I've often heard people say that 
How very disgusted they feel, 
To see some people overloaded with fat, 
4 
When they ought to be thin and genteel. 
Gentility's all very well, 
But you fat ones have all got the grin; 
You look like as if you never eat a 
smell 
When you look so remarkably thin. . 
Oh! shouldn't I 
like to get fat, etc. 
T'other morning I 
rose from my bed 
No one on earth could excel, 
I 
devoured a 
box full of eggs, 
And a 
side of fat bacon as well, 
eat off a 
loin of cold pork, 
And a 
stunning sheep's head, 
I 
feed off turkey and chine, 
And I 
picked a 
cow's heel while in bed. 
Oh ! shouldn't I 
like to get fat, etc. 
-A score of boiled dumplings for lunch, 
And a 
plate full of oysters I 
eat, 
And radishes all of a 
bunch, 
But I 
don't think them much of a 
treat. 
Sometimes at a 
pie-stand I 
halt, 
And I 
eat all the man's got in his tin, 
But I 
eat them without any salt, 
Because they say, " salt makes people look thin." 
Oh! shouldn't I 
like to get fat, etc. 
There's my sister, Mary Ann, I 
declare, 
Was thin as a 
lamp-post in size, 
I 
met her t'other day at the fair, 
And I 
could scarcely believe my own eyes, 
She's so chubby and fat to the veins, 
What she's been eating I 
cannot make out, 
She's been married six months it is true, 
And she's found out a 
way to get stout. 
Oh I 
aint she got y,yonderful fat, etc-
I 
REALLY COULDN'T HELP IT. 
An Entirely New Version, 
As 
sung by TONY PASTOR. 
A 
charming girl the other day 
In the street accosted me, 
Inquired if the exhibition 
I 
should like to see. 
In the fashion she was dress'd, 
With such a 
crinoline, 
I 
invited here immediately 
To take a 
glass of wine. 
Chorus. 
I 
really couldn't help it, 
Couldn't help it, 
Couldn't help it, 
I 
really couldn't help it, 
Nor any other man. 
She was so agreeable, 
My affections soon did win, 
So lovingly entreated me 
To stand a 
pint of gin ; 
My love then quickly vanished, 
As she callel for Binninger's best, 
A 
pint she drank so readily, 
With the greatest zest. 
She really couldn't help it, 
Couldn't help it, 
Couldn't help it, 
She really couldn't help it, 
She was such a 
lushy gal. 
Of the exhibition all ideas 
Vanished quite away, 
She said we might postpone it 
To another day. 
16 
I 
REALLY COULDN'T HELP IT. 
To dinner she supposed 
Together we should go, 
A 
denial I 
intended, • 
I 
couldn't really say—No 1 
I 
really couldn't help it, 
Couldn't help it, 
Couldn't help it, 
I 
really couldn't help it, 
She was such a 
cunning gal. 
So lovingly her arms 
Around me then she press'd, 
A 
kiss she took, likewise 
My watch from out my vest, 
A 
policeman in plain elothes, 
The movement did perceive, 
Declared that she was a 
thief, 
I 
scarcely cculd believe. 
I 
really couldn't help it, 
Couldn't help it, 
Couldn't help it, 
I 
really couldn't help it, 
She was such a 
MODEST gal. 
The Bobby she called crusher, 
Area sneak and brute, 
lie took her to the station house, 
I 
declined fo prosecute. 
The magistrate desired me, 
To give a 
reason, cause, 
For doing so, I 
Said 
Simply. sirs because--
I 
really couldn't help it, 
Couldn't help it, 
Couldn't help it, 
I 
really couldn't help it, 
She was such a 
11:icked gal. 
WE'LL ALL DRINK TO UNCLE SAM. 
17 
She was known so well, 
SPOTTED was the phrase, 
The magistrate commented 
On her wicked ways. 
Three months he only gave her; 
But if she came again 
For trial he would send her, 
To plead would be in vain. 
He really couldn't help it, 
Couldn't help it, 
Couldn't help it, 
He really couldn't it. 
She was such a 
wicked gal. 
Her exceeding lady looks 
The day before express'd, 
Disappeared. she did not seem, 
In the least distress'd. 
When the magistrate had finished, 
So impertinent she said: 
" 
All right, old bloat, three months 
Upon my blessed head." 
" 
Like a 
brick can do it, 
I 
can do it, 
I 
can do it, 
Like a 
brick can do it 
Or any other gal." 
WE'LL ALL DRINK TO ITNCILE SAM. 
Written and sung by TONY I'asToa. 
Ant—" Johnny fill up the bowl." 
The Union Cause is going ahead, 
Ahead, ahead, 
The rebels' cause will soon be dead 
Be dead, be dead. 
18 
WE'LL ALL DRINK TO UNCLE SAM. 
Their game is up and their hope is fled, 
We'll make them repent of the blood they shed, 
We'll all drink to Uncle Sam: 
Johnny, fill up the bowl. 
And though they boast of a 
General Bragg, 
A 
Bragg, old Bragg, 
Who always follows their rebel rag, 
A 
rag, old rag, 
But in running away he neyer will lag 
When he ,.,6ets in sight of the Union flag, 
And we'll all drink to Uncle Sam : 
Johnny, fill up the bowl. 
Though Uncle Sam they don't admire, 
Admire, admire, . 
From Charleston we'll make them retire, 
Retire, retire ; 
Or Sherman there will knock them higher 
With a 
dose or two of that same Greek fire, 
And we'll all drink to Uncle Sam: 
Johnny, fill up the bowl. 
Then there's our gallant General Grant, 
OurkGrant, brave Grant, 
Get clear of him the rebels can't, 
They can't, they can't: 
At Vicksburgh he gave them all they want, 
And at Chattanooga he made them pant, 
And we'll all drink to Uncle Sam : 
Johnny, fill up the bowl. 
And there's brave General Sherman too, 
! 
too, Oh! too, 
Where'er he went he made them blue, 
All blue, Oh blue, 
And the Union troops will still advance 
Until secession has nary a 
chance 
And we'll all drink to Uncle Sam: 
Johnny, fill up the bowl. 
PARODY ON JUST BEFORE THE BATTLE. 
When we shrike rebellion a 
final blow, 
Oh Ito ! you know— 
We to the world our power will show, 
Oh ho! that's so. 
We'll send some troops to Mex-i-co, 
And a 
few more into Canada go, 
Then we'll all drink to Uncle Sam: 
Johnny, fill up the bowl. 
PARODY ON " JUST BEFORE THE BATTLE." 
Written by EUGENE T. 
JOHNSTON. 
Sung by TONY PASTOR. 
Just before the battle, mother, 
I 
was drinking mountain dew, 
But when I 
saw the rebels marching, 
Unto the rear I 
quickly flew ; 
Where all the stragglers were flying, 
Thinking of their homes or wives— 
It was not the " Rebs " they fear'd dear mother, 
But their own dear precious lives. 
Then farewell mother, you will never, 
See my name among the slain ; 
For if I 
only can skedaddle, 
Dear mother, I'll come home again. 
I 
have no thirst for martial glory, 
Fame and honor's all my eye; 
I'd rather be a 
home-guard private— 
. 
Than a 
Brigadier " Come home to die." 
" 
Salt horse" and crackers, dearest mother. 
Are not the things to make one brave; 
And I 
assure you I 
have no ambition, 
To fill an early honored grave. 
I 
hear the bugle sounding, mother, 
(My soul is eager for the fray.) 
THE SEWING MACHINE. 
I 
guess I'll hide beneath some cover, 
And then I 
will be all 0. K. 
Discretion's the better part of valor 
At least, I've often heard you say ;— 
And he that loves his life, dear mother, 
Won't fight if he can run away.

NG- MACHIN 
As su g 
by TONY PASTOR. 
Ant---" Charcoal Man," 
I 
am one of those unlucky chaps, who once did fall in love 
With such a 
nice good looking girj, who seem'd just like a 
dove, 
Her hair was long and black, and as curly as ever was seen, 
And she said she got her livelihood by working a 
sewing 
machine. 
So I 
fairly lost my heart, now I 
wish I 
never had seen 
That dark young girl with her hair in curl that worked at 
a 
sewing machine. 
I 
saw her first in Chatham Street in such a 
dashing shop, 
Working Singer's No. 2, at the window I 
did stop. 
By the signs that passed between us, 13arnum's Museum 
she'd not seen, 
But she promised to meet if I'd stand treat, when she'd 
done at the sewing machine. 
So I 
fairly lost my heart, etc. 
'Well, I 
took her to the Museum, and for the two I 
paid, 
And while we walked about the rooms, she said, I 
feel 
afraid 
That I 
shall lose my money, then she gave rue such a 
look, 
And said, dear sir, will you take care of this my pocket 
book ? 
So I 
fairly lost my heart, etc. 
I 
told her not to be afraid, I'd guard it with my life. 
And thought how happy I 
should be, if she was my dear 
wife. 
Then I 
heard the cry of stop thief, and before a 
word I 
could say, 
I 
was collar'd so tight, and out of my sight my girl had 
bolted away. 
So I 
fairly lost my heart, etc. 
I 
asked them what they meant by it, I 
asked them if they. 
knew 
'Who I 
was, when they replied: " I 
should rather think 
we do; 
For officers are we, and of nailing a 
watch you're accused, 
And beware what you say, for against you some day as 
evidence it may be used." 
So I 
fy 
lost my heart. etc., 
Next morning I 
was taken up, and the officers did tell 
The magistrate that they thought to the police I 
was known 
quite well, 
Tho' the watch had not been found on him, the police he 
does fear, 
For from him we took a 
pocket book containing a 
bundle 
of" queer." 
So I 
fairly lost my heart, etc. 
The magistrate then looked at me and asked what can 
you say, 
I 
told him how I 
came possessed of the book the previous 
day. 
I 
got it from a 
nice young girl, her age about seventeen, 
She was a 
fine young girl with her hair in curl, and she 
worked a 
sewing machine. 
So I 
fairly lost my heart, etc. 
The magistrate then shook his head, and said " That tale 
won't do, 
I'll remand you for a 
week or so, to see what's known of 
you.,,

Tho' nothing 'gainst me could be found, yet everywhere 
they'd been, 
Still I got three months at Blackwell's Isle, where I 
learned to tread a

A IR—"H appy Land of Canaan." 
'T was in the month of June, when the birds were in full 
tune, 
I 
first met a 
charming little creature, 
Her eyes they shone as bright as the twinkling stars at 
night, 
And a 
kind of smile played on every feature. 
I 
said, " My dearest Belle, your name to me pray tell, 
For you're just about the sort I 
admire." 
She tossed her pretty head, as blushingly she said, 
My name's Diana, Kitty, Annie, Maria ! 
Chorus. 
You should only see her feet as she trips along the street, 
She is just the Oft to admire, 
The truth to you I'll tell, she's the pride I 
love so well, 
Is my darling Diana, Kitty, Annie, Maria! 
She's the prettiest little foot, in the prettiest little boot, 
And a 
pretty little ancle, too, believe me, 
She's got such a 
pretty face and a 
darling little waist, 
And looks like a 
girl as won't deceive ye ; 
No lady in the land has got a 
prettier hand, 
And a 
pretty fortune left by her sure, 
She's a 
beauty altogether, from her bonnet to boot leather, 
Is my darling Diana, Kitty. Annie, Maria! 
When I 
take her to the park, them soldiers they remark, 
" 
I 
should like to give that girl a 
dozen kisses, 
DIANA , 
KITTY, ANNIE , 
MARIA. 
23 
Or I'd give a 
full month's pay to take her slick away, 
For that must be the pinnacle of blisses ;" 
Them tall " quills " how hard they try, they wink so very 
sly, 
And their padded forms most girls admire, 
But their winking games won't do, she sticks to me like 
glue, 
Does my darling Diana, Kitty,- Annie, Maria ! 
I 
took her to a 
ball, up at Dodworth's Hall, 
You should have seen her going thro' the Lancers, 
On the light fantastic toe we round and round did go, 
We really did astonish all the dancers; 
For the Polka she can dance like any girl from France. 
I 
had no idea she was such a 
flier, 
So graceful, light and airy, like a 
little flying fairy, 
Is my darling Diana, Kitty, Annie, Maria ! 
Oft I 
take her to the play, just to pass the time away, 
And the opera, too, when in season, 
For she sings like any lark from daylight until dark, 
And I 
mean to bring her out next season. 
Many singers there may be, who can only sing to G ; 
But she can sing three octaves higher, 
Believe me, 'tis true, she can sing to DOUBLE YOU (W), 
Can my darling Diana, Kitty, Annie, Maria! 
Single longer I 
won't tarry, for her I'm going to marry, 
To the old parson I've been and given warning, 
To make us TWO in ONE, 
like a 
penny hot cross bun 
m 
In three weeks from 
next Monday mo rni

With our little, family, how happy we shall be. 
One BOY and THREE GIRLS we require, 
For the little boy, you see, shall be christened after mg, 
And the girls, DIANA, KITTY, and ANNIE, M ARIA!

I STOOD IT LIKE A LAMB. 
A s 
sung by TONY PASTOR. 
Some people always grumble 
At whatever luck they meet; 
And others if they tumble 
Fall always on their feet: 
You've not the least idea 
What a 
happy chap I 
am, 
Good fortune never tires me, 
I 
stand it like a 
lamb ! 
Though some may with a 
silver spoon 
Stuck in their mouths be born, 
I 
wasn't, but I'd just as soon .• 
Use one of bone or horn! 
So long as I've sufficient 
What need is there to cram ? 
If fortune's blind she's not unkind— 
I 
stand it like a 
lamb! 
'Twas on one lovely afternoon 
I 
was walking down Broadway 
With a 
damsel fairer than the moon, 
In Taylor's we did stray! 
. Champagne, and punch, and oyster pie 
She soon contrived to cram! 
And though the bill was rather high 
I 
stood it like a 
lamb! 
In a 
Bowery stage the other night 
I 
was riding down the street; 
A 
lady stood upon my right, 
In my lap she took a 
seat; 
She blpshed and smiled so sweet on me, 
She tied to act quite calm, 
And though I 
twisted awfully 
She stood it like a 
lamb! 
IN A QUIET SORT OF WAY . 
25 
If ever your addresses 
To a 
young girl you should pay: 
Attention and caresses . 
May all be thrown away: 
But would you asaertain the truth 
Instead of hearing sham, 
Select a 
widow, gentle youth, 
She'll stand it like a 
lamb! 
The rebel cause is getting weak, 
Secession's rather stale: 
The news from Sherman makes them squeak 
And all the South to pale: 
And General Grant, our country's pride,' 
Will show it's all a 
sham : 
Back to the Union they will slide, 
And stand it like a 
lamb! 
IN A 
QUIET SORT OF WAY. 
As sung by TONY PASTOR. 
We 
sniile at the minece,ssary 
Trouble people take, 
For fortune is not regulated 
By the fuss we make. 
'don't advise indifference, 
But this I 
mean to say, 
It's just as well to take things 
In a 
quiet sort of way. 
'Tis only from experience 
I 
find this course is best, 
There was a 
time when I 
was 
As impulsive as the rest; 
When something like a 
steam-engine 
My feelings used to play, 
But it's just as well to take things 
In a 
quiet sort of way.

IN A QUIET SORT OF WAY . 
When I 
was some years younger, 
Oh, how pleased I 
used to be 
In recounting the Adventures 
I 
had seen when on a 
spree. 
But, now, about the sprees I 
have 
No word, you'll hear me say, 
It's just as well to take things 
In a 
quiet sort of way. 
How easy ' tis to fall in love, • 
And how your heart will break, 
And prospects all be blighted 
For a 
fickle woman's sake; 
I've been in love a 
dozen times, 
And confidently say 
It's just as well to take thing's 
In a 
quieit 
sort of way. 
Tho' frequently in love I've been, 
More often still in 'debt, , 
And years ago, when short ofeash, 
How much I 
used to fret; 
But fretting is a 
folly, 
Without money who can pay, 
It's just as well to take things • 
In a 
quiet sort of way. 
I 
often think this life of ours 
Is something like a 
race, 
They seldom win who make the running, 
Nothing kills like pace; 
A 
horse that's quickest at the start 
Is seldom good to stay, 
So it's just as well to take things 
In a 
quiet sort of way. 
I 
think of getting married, 
And can't repress a 
smile, 
For the damsel whom I 
fancy 
Is exactly in my style. 
I.

And, sipping his wine, has of-ten told 
That woman was a 
rid-die and marriage a 
lot-te-ry, 
And wives at the Al-tar were bought and sold. 
His reason for this I 
cannot di-vine, 
For it was not the case with the wife of mine, 
She'd a

And they all got a

In my youthful mind, so I 
soon did decide 
To cut broad cloth, and, in the garb of t 
mechanic, 
From the unwash'd mul-ti-tude seek a 
bride, 
'Twas there I 
found this wife of mine, 
When I 
laid my heart at Cu-pid's shrine,

MOTHER 0.N. THE BRAIN. 
Written by EUGENH T. 
JOHNSON. 
Ant--" The Captain with his whiskers." 
NOM—Respectfully dedicated to the youth of both sexes, who are 
afflicted with that fearful (modern) malady known as " Mother 
on the brain." 
Mother songs are all the rage, of course, you all do know, 
You'll hear these touching ditties wherever you may go; 
In the cot, in the parlor, even on the battle plain, 
Our soldier boys all seem to have " Mother on the brain." 
This mania is increasing most fearful, I 
avow, 
Ever since the appearance of " Who'll care for mother 
now ?" 
I've arranged a 
list of mother songs together in a 
string, 
And with your kind permission, them to you I'll sing, 
What is home without a 
mother (in a 
garret near the sky,) 
Courage, mother, I 
am going, mother I've come home to die; 
Mother is the battle over, have our soldiers gained the day, 
I 
can't mind my wheel, mother, (what will Mrs.Grund v 
say.) 
It was my mother's custom--my grandmother's advice, 
The song my mother loved to sing, (a 
big thing on ice.) 
Kiss my mother dear for me, mother I've come home again, 
Break it gently to my mother, I've got mother on the 
brain. 
Write a 
letter to my mother, send it when her boy is dead, 
Tell mother I 
die happy, (is Joe Muggin's dog long dead ?) 
Is that mother bending o'er me, 'tis th e 
ri
ng my 
mother 
Wore,
Rock me to sleep, mother (on the old Virginny shore.) 
Let me kiss him for his mother, let me kiss his infant brow-, 
Bless me, mother, ere I 
die .... who will care for mother 
now ? 
My dear kind old mother (her name was Mary Blanc,) 
I 
cannot call her mother, I've got mother on the brain.

SHE GENTLY PRESS'S MY HAND . 
Just before the battle, mother; I 
was thinking most of you, 
Be quiet, do, I'll call my mother (for an old Irish stew ;) 
Mother dear would comfort me, if she were here, 
I'm lonely since my mother died (from drinking lager bier). 
A 
mother's love can never change (picking a 
ham bone,) 
I'll not forget thee, mother, wherever I 
may roam: 
0 
sing me to resf, mother, (Joe Bowers is my name,) 
Kiss me, good-night, mother, with mother on the brain. 
SHE GENTLY PRESS'D MY HAND. 
As sung by To 
PASTOR. 
Now, when first I 
landed here, Oh! I 
never shall forget, 
In walking down the city, a 
young and charming girl I 
met; 
I 
vowld, she courtsie'd, then said she, " you're come from 
Yankee land ?" 
And gave me such a 
wicked smile, and gently pressed my 
hand. 
Chorus. 
Saying, come along, walk along, my name is little Fan, 
And I 
know you won't refuse me, for you're such a 
kind 
young man. 
Said I, " Oh! now, my beauty, pray now, come along 
with me, 
And take a ; 
but young miss preferr'd a 
cup of tea. 
In a 
coffee shop we both went, to take tea at the stand, 
Where she still gave me that wicked look, and gently 
pressed my hand, 
Chorus—Saying, come along, etc. 
She partook of ham and eggs, and a 
nice strong cup of tea, 
Then modest looked, and said: " Sir, mother's waiting up 
for me ;" 
I 
gave the waiter a 
greenback, to pay up his demand, 
She saw it, oh! the look she gave; still gently pressed my 
hand. 
Chorus—Saying, come along, etc. 
SHE GENTLY PRESS'D MY HAND. 
37 
I 
really felt I 
loved her; so I 
mustered words to say, 
" 
If no objection, madam, 
see you on your way," 
"With Pleasure, sir," was her reply; majestic and so 
grand, 
Still giving me that y;icked. look, as she gently pressed my 
hand. 
1 Chorus—Saying, come along, etc. 
She took my arm, without alarm, and look'd like any saint, 
When, with a 
cry, she said, 0 
my! I'm sure I'm going to 
faint. • 
She did—I 
brought her to; after some trouble at a 
stand, 
On recovering, still she wicked smil'd, and gently pre,ss'd 
my hand. 
Chorus—Saying, come along, etc. 
While in her faint, she thought fit, in the pocket of my 
coat, 
To slily slip her hand and take the change of my green-
back note; 
Not a 
word then did I 
say to this lady fine and grand, 
Who gave me such a 
wicked look, as she gently pressed 
my hand. 
Chorus— Saying, come along, etc.. 
Near Madison Square she hail'd a 
cab as it passed by, 
Then, getting in, she thank'd me, as a 
tear came in her 
eye; 
" 
But," said I, " excuse me, pray, 'ere you drive off from 
the stand, 
I'll take the change of my greenback; I 
come from Yankee 
land." 
- 
Chorus—Saying, come along, etc.. `-
Confused, my pardon begg'd; said I, "No fool in me you'll 
find, 
Tho sometimes you may meet with fools ; I'm not one of 
that kind; 
For if you think to cheat me, indeed, that I'll never stand, 
Tho' you can give a 
wicked smile, and gently press a 
hand." 
Chorus—Saying, come along, etc.

THE SLY GLANCE . 
nit: SLY GLANCE. 
New Version. 
As sung by TONY PASTOR. 
AIR—" The Captain with hiliwhiskers." 
One evening in my bed room so thoughtfully I 
sat, 
How to manage for the best, in fact what to be ; 
„My landlady then entered, and hinted so polite 
That six weeks' rent was due to her that very night ; 
In course of conversation, se delicate I 
said 
If ever an idea she entertained to wed; 
Her apron string she twisted, supposed she ne'er should be, 
Who would ever fancy her, with a 
sly glance at me. 
I 
complimented, flatter'd her, the rent was, quite forget, 
Being short of money, struck the iron whilst ' twas hot ; 
A 
greenback I 
borrowed, which she granted readily, 
So with wardrobe in my carpet bag, bid adieu to No. 3 ; 
But cruel Fate ordained, soon we should meet again. 
One day, beneath an archway, taking shelter from the rain, 
Who should run so suddenly, by the side of Me, 
But my landlady who took an ugly glance at me. 
To her very chilling looks, I 
the rain did far prefer, 
"When at a 
little distance I 
observed a 
milliner, 
A 
previous introduction, created fresh alarms, 
When uplifted I 
beheld a 
chubby pair of arms, 
So pressing she inquired, where of late I 
had been, 
As for a 
twelve months anywhere, me she had not seen. 
The little mortal looked, and appeared to see 
Her darling dear Hopa, took a 
sly glance at me. 
I 
appointed on that very night her again to meet, 
As through the heavy falling rain,I made a.quick retreat; 
But on that very evening, another lady did I 
spy, 
I 
could not really withstand her little killing eye; 
To the Park, then being dusk, for a 
stroll we went, 
To my pressinc, invitation she quickly did assent ; 
Whilst seated, to obtain a 
kiss, I 
was making free, 
When a 
Bobby with his bull's eye, took a 
sly glance at me. 
CRICK CORI, t` 
DIDN'T SUE BEM TO LIKE IT." 
39 
But now I 
have forgotten all those naughty tricks, 
To lead a 
steady life I 
mean, on a 
way to fix; 
Should there be one here present, lady passing fair, 
I 
am ready now to marry, a 
fact I 
do declare. - 
My early life I 
have detailed, everything to you, 
But my ways intend to alte(a) r, a 
lady's name will 
too, 
So ladies if for better, for worse, you will have me, 
Signify the same, and cast a 
sly glance at me.

One night I 
went out for a 
spree, 
Some adventures just to see; 
I 
soon met a 
lady fair, 
At her I 
winked—I 
do declare. 
Didn't she seem to like it, 
Didn't she seem to like it, 
Didn't she seem to like it, 
Upon my word she did. 
I 
went to her, had a 
talk, 
Invited her to take a 
walk, 
Of course she said there was no harm, 
So politely offered her my arm. 
Didn't she seem to like it, etc. 
She declared I 
was so kind, 
Of course, I 
said, " Oh ! never mind," 
Into a

I 
called for stout, but she drank

CRICK CORN, " DIDN'T SHE SEEM TO LIKE IT." 
For an oyster supper I 
was bent, 
To join me she was quite content, 
Six dozen had, I 
think about, 
But then the extra double stout. 
Didn't she seem to like it, etc. 
At last she saw a 
fine young man, 
To converse with him began. 
She left me saying with a 
grin: • 
"I had hint for oysters, stout, and gin." 
Oh ! didn't they seem to like it, etc. 
Whilst standing by myself alone,. 
Found my watch and chain had gone. 
I 
caught her. how she did entreat; 
But she was taken to Centre Street. 
• 
And she didn't seem to like it, etc. 
Next morning I 
was early there, 
To prosecute this lady fair, 
Of course, her fate she did bewail, 
For six months she was sent to gaol. 
And she didn't seem to like it, etc. 
So warning, young man, take, I 
pray, 
From fair ones leading you astray; 
For you will find that every one 
Will go the entire hog or none. 
And don't they seem to like it, 
And don't they seem to like it, 
And don't they seem to like it, 
There's no mistake in that.

THE ERISH ACTOR. 
A 
Popular Hibernian Sketch. 
As sung by Ma. Sam ComaNs. 
A113-" Pat's Curiosity Shop." 
By way of an introduction, my name's Mr. Denis O'Sha 
Long before I 
was born, so they tell me, I wrote a 
most. 
illigant play; 
The poetry, plot, and conception e'en the great Shake-
speare couldn't surpass, 
'Twas pertaining to tragedy, comedy, opera, burlesque, 
and farce; 
It so puzzl'd the play-folks to act it, that it was going to be 
. put on the shelf, 
So I 
popp'd up behind the green curtain, and acted the 
whole play myself. 
Spoken. 
Snre and faith, precocious talent was the family badge 
of the O'Sha's. 
My father could say the alphabet before 
; 
but for th e 
matter 
of 
that 
he could speak, and 
strutted, 
and 
fretted 
his 
bowers on the 
stage before he 
was 
short-coated 
, 
he was always short coated, for the only coat he had to his 
back was a 
pair of leathei• breeches, and they were down at 
heel; but, as Shakespeare says, in his play of Umphery-
Clinker-
0 ! that estates and offices were given to the merit of the 
winner, 
How many hungury mouths would be well fed, 0, 
How many be well clad whin they were naked, 
How many be employed whin out of work, 
How many have full pockets that are empty." 
Sure and faith, it was just so wid father, for he always 
had the most labor to do whin he was out of work; and he 
was a 
man of such strict honor, that he always wash'd his 
hands of a 
dirty action before he did it; so that he even 
42 
THE IRISH ACTOR : 
commanded respect from the great that were dead and bur-
ned ; and he used to say, as Shakespeare said, in the words 
of Ben Jonsoa:— 
"Put honor in one eye, and your fist in the other, 
And I'll see them both in blindness, 
As I 
love the name of honor more than I 
do the fist." 
Chorus. 
Am—" St. Patrick was a Gentleman." 
That I'm an actor bred and born, sure there's no one can 
deny sirs, 
At my tragedy they laugh, at my comedy they cry, sirs; 
My voice and action's just the style, in favor I'm advancing, 
And instead of singing of my songs, by the powers they're 
done by dancing. 
Spoken. 
Arrah, sure I 
am the broth of a boy for that same, as 
Shakespeare says, in the words of Goldsmith:— 
"Many a 
flower is born to blush unseen 
, Look'd but coldly on sure everywhere." 
And wasn't the great Shakespeare a 
sample of that 
same. 'William Shakespeare was born at Stratford in Bow, 
in the county of Cork. 
He showed marks of very early 
genius, and paid great attention to his learning by playing 
the truant every day he wint to school. 
He passbd his time 
in poaching and deer-stealing, which so delighted the lord 
of the manner that he gave young Shakespeare three months 
in Newgate, only Billy gave them leg-bail, and escaped 
from prison before they got him in it; so he walled every 
step of the way to London by riding in a 
wagon ; but 
after all he couldn't dance a 
song like this—

AUG-Ub.I. US TEE MDCH, AND EVELINA 
MUCHEE. 
A 
Ballad in Zany Tunes. 
Written for and presented to Torn' PASTOR, Esq., by 
D ICK H ARMLESS. 
AIR—" Blue-tail Fly." 
Now, good folks, listen while I 
sing, 
About a 
very curious thing, 
That happened down in New Jersey ;— 
I 
want you all to list to me, 
For I 
kind of think you'll like it,— 
I 
rather guess you'll like it ; 
I 
kind of think you'll like it— 
Upon my soul, I 
do. 
Aut—" Sights for a 
Father." 
In Hackensack town, Evelina did live, 
Handsome, gay and delicious; 
Her heart was as warm as the bright sun above, 
And she never acted capricious ; 
She studied from nature, she always said, 
"I'was as deep as the great Bay of Fundy ;— 
She honored her -papa, adored her mamma, 
And never told lies on a 
Sunday. 
Ant—" Fine old English Gentleman." 
Not very far from Hackensack, about a 
mile I'd say, 
Lived Augustus William, handsome, fair and gay, 
He was the nicest young man that e'er was _brought up 
there, 
(And he could fight, dance, play the piano, billiards, seven: 
up, or anything else), and Lord ! how he could swear: 
This fancy, gay young gentleman, 
The hero of my rhyme! 
Aia—" Lucy Long." 
Now, Augustus met Evelina, 
And slap in love he went, 
44 
AUGUSTUS THE MUCH, 
AND SVELINA. 
THE mucriuri. 
And .Evelina very kindly 
Returned the cumpliment. 
For Augustus loved Evelina, 
And Evelina she lofed he; 
And they were the healthiest couple 
In all New Jersiee! 
AIR—" Bob and Joan." 
Things went on quite fair, 
In love they grew still thicker, 
They'd pull each other's hair. 
And hug and kiss, and snicker. 
Then Augustus he would say, 
My dear you look divinely, 
To which she would reply, 
(Spoken.)—" Well, law, now, Gussy, I 
kinder flatter my-
self." 
" 
I 
keeps my shape up finely." 
Ant—" Red, White and Blue I" 
When war desolated our country, 
And turned our brethren to foes, 
— 
The South swore she would secede, sir, 
And the North vowed she wouldn't let her go. 
(Spoken.)—But she did, in spite of the Horne Guard. 
Then Augustus swore defiant, 
To his country he'd ever prove true, 
For the T.Inion, the Flag and- Constitution, 
He'd fight for the Red, White and Blue, 
He'd fight for the Red, White and Blue, 
He'd fight for the Red, White and Blue, 
For the Union, the Flag, and Constitution, 
He'd DIE for the Red, White and Blue! (But he didn't.) 
AIR—" Yankee Manufacture." 
So one day he said to Evelina, 
Don't think that I'm a 
ninny, 
But I'm going to whip the Southern foe, 
Way down in Old Virginny. 
AUGUSTUS THE MUCH , 
AND EVELINA" 
THE MUCHER. 
45 
I'm going to fight for liberty, 
Till every rebel codger 
Is laid down in a 
Southern grave,— 
I'm going to be a 
soger! 
That's what I 
mean, dear Eveline, 
I'm going to be a 
soger! 
(Spoken.)—When the young lady heard this news, she 
immedrately fainted, but in the course of a 
half hour. she 
gained sufficient breath to make the following heart-rend-
ing, soul-thrilling, and affectionate appeal: 
AIR—" I 
would not give the hand," etc. ' 
I've been solght for by the brave, 
By the honest and the true; 
Men for me would have dug their graves 
If I'd only asked them to. 
But I'd not prove false to thee, 
For my heart is all thine own, 
But if thou lea-vest me, 
I 
shall pine, and die alone! 
And no other man shall dare 
For to kiss and fondle me, 
Canso I've given my heart and hand, 
To my own, my dear Gussy. 
(Spoken.)—Then the young man said: 
,Ane--" Gentle Zerlina." (From Diavolo.) 
Sweet Evelina, don't look so black, 
Your Gussy's coming, he's soon coming back. 
How happy you'll feel, when I 
return a 
brigadier, 
No one shall harm you, no one we'll fear! 
Then' sweet Evelina, don't look so black, 
Your Gussy's coining, he's soon coming back! 
AIR—" Jeannette and Jeannot." 
You're going far away, far away from Eveline, 
I 
never thought you'd be so cruel, never act so mean. 
You leave me here, Gussy. for to pine and groan, 
You're going to leave me, Gussy, for to die alone ! 
•, 
46 
AUGUSTUS THH MUCH, AND EVELINA THE MUCHER. 
When you wear your suit of blue, you'll never think of me, 
You'll marry some black maiden in old Virginny; 
With your gun upon your shoulder, you'll feel so very 
glad, 
You'll marry some young woman with a 
nigger for a 
dad. 
Am—" 
Annie of the Vale." 
(Spoken.)—Now, the young man got slightly angry, be-
cause the young woman didn't place the utmost confidence 
ihi what he said; so he burst out with: 
Oh! do stop your blowing,. 
You know, there's no knowing, 
How very soon that I'll come back to thee ! 
Besides. I'll have my money, 
And I'd think it very funny, 
If you didn't contrive to have a 
share with me!" 
So come, come, come, love, come, 
Do dry those foolish tears. 
If you want to sicken Gussy, 
Just act a 
little fussy, 
And I'll skedaddle like a 
new-made brigadier r 
Ant--" Pop goes the WeazeL" 
(Spoken)—Then the young woman got her back up, and 
said: 
I 
do not care how soon you go, 
I 
do not care a 
penny, 
You never loved me, Guss, at a\l, 
You never loved me any. 
You're going to whip the Southern foe, 
You feel so awful fussy ; 
But some rebel man will lay you low, 
Then pop, goes my Gussy! 
Ai—" Joe Bowers." 
(Spoken.)—Now, the young man thought that he'd soften 
her down a 
bit. 
So in a 
very pathetic manher, he cried: 
AUGUSTUS THE MUCH, AND EVELINA. THE MUCHER. 
47 
Oh. dearest Evelina, don't think so hard of me, 
I 
love you better than my life, next to my COUNTEREY 
My heart is almost bursting, alas! I've broke the spell,--
My country now is calling, so, Evy, fare thee well 
Ant—" Poor Old Maide 1" 
Then he left her all alone, 
Poor young gal! 
Then he left her all alone, 
Poor young gal! 
Then he left her all alone, 
For to sigh, to grieve, and groan, 
'Twos enough to turn her heart to stone! 
Poor young gal! 
AIR—" Sprig of Shillalsh 1" 
As soon as he left her she swore by her. fist 
That she'd not stop a 
minute until she'd enlist, 
And fight for the Union wherever she went; 
For there's no use of trying to die down here,' 
I'd rather much die a 
bold volunteer; 
And since my dear lover has gone far from me, 
Why, I'll take a 
trip into old Virginny, 
And follow my Gussy wherever he goes. 
Ant--" Wait for the Wagon." 
Horace Greeley's often told us, 
And he vows that it is true, 
That to tustle for the nigger 
Is what every one should do! 
Then fight for the nigger, 
The black, trgly nigger, 
The wooly-headed nigger 
Of the abGlition crew! 
Am —"

Then she turned right around, walked to the house, 
Put on her daddy's clothes as still as a

Some Graham's Onguent on her lip she gave a 
dash, 
And in fifteen minutes she'd SUCH a

Then she wheeled right about, marched. to the. town,

And danced around like a

She played seven-up with the brigadier, 
Whist with the colonel, too. 
With the captain drank lager beer, 
For that was all they had to do! 
A 
life in the soger's tent, etc. 
Ant—" Mankind are only Birds." 
Although Evy felt quite happy, 
She oft thought of Gussy, dear, 
And, when no one looked at her, 
She'd gently drop a 
tear! 
One clay she met a 
soger man, 
And asked amid her groans, 
" 
Do you know a 
young man with a

Whose name is Gussy Jones ?"

" 
Oh, yes !" cried the soger, " I 
know him well, 
He's just marched away for his rations! 
I'll tell you what, he is an awful swell, 
And he's just marched away for his rations! 
Oh! 'aint he heavy, pizen on the eat, 
Lord! how he'd tackle a 
pair of pig's feet, 
He'd eat out a 
butcher shop before yo:t could squeak, 
And he's just away for his rations !" 
Ant—" Merry Months of May!" 
" 
Then," said Evy, " pray, tell me true! 
What is Gussy Jones out here!. 
Is he in command of the ' Dingy Blues ?' 
Or is he yet a, brigadier ?" 
"No," cried the soger with a 
grin, 
" 
He's neither one nor 'tother of ' em, 
But for noble conduct when the grub was laid, 
He blackens the boots for the Nigger Brigade.' 
He was such a 
healthy, nice young man, 
Honest-hearted, brave and true; 
A 
favorite with the cap-ti-an, 
And so the captain put him through !" 
.-
Am—" Raspberry Wine," " Paddy Miles," etc. 
Then Evy jumped up and cried out in triumph, 
" 
I 
knew my dear Gussy somebody would be, 
He was considered a 
genius when he was a 
youngster, 
And now he has proved it by his strategy." 
Then somebody touched her right near the elbow, 
She turned and saw Gussy, her own darling man, 
She kissed him, and hugged him, and called him her honey, 
And he gobbled her up like a 
Rockaway clam! 
Ai—" John Brown's Body." 
"I'M glad to see you, Evy," and he gave her such a 
squeeze, 
He almost made the little maiden sneeze; 
She perspired round the frontispiece, trembled at the knees. 
She felt so happy then!

little fussy, 
" 
Why, then, ray darling little pussy, 
We'll both go marching home !" 
Ant--" Ivy Green!" 
Early next morn, ' ere the sun arose, 
They travelled right out of the tent; 
Evy put on some female clothes, 
And right straight home they went. 
And then he clasped the maiden fair, . 
Hugged her tight to he, 
Smoothed her curly, auburn hair, 
And then cried joyfully:

Now, since you've listened to my rhyme, 
I 
think that I

If e'.er a

Who vows to you strict constancy, 
And for a 
while you would be free, 
Never let her know where you're going, d'ye see; 
For should she take it in her head, 
She'd follow you 'till you're half-dead, 
And before you know it you're married— 
They're awful things when you know them! 
Now, since I've sung about a 
mile, 
I 
think it's time for me to smile ; 
So, boys, just clap for me mean while, 
And I'll be out directly.

HAPPY MAN, OR IT CAN'T T,AgT. 
As 
sung by TONY PASTOR. 
AIR—" Very polite o' Her." 
I'm the happiest man 'neath the sun, 
Altho' I 
am chin deep in trouble, 
I 
contrive to be full of my tun, 
To give the blue devils the double. 
I'm blest with the gout and rheumatic, 
I'm mostly a 
martyr to pain; 
I'm lodged in a 
very queer attic, 
But Lknow it's no use to complain, 
For I 
never meet troubles half way, 
Or fret after things that are past, 
If bad luck comes in the way, 
I'm happy, because it can't last. 
Spoken. 
No, it can't last. 
Now what bad judges we are of our 
own happiness, by scorning the warnings of the good old 
proverbs. 
For instance they teach us to leave well enough 
alone. 
Now, I 
must try to mak well better, and make 
bad worse. 
They say, look befor 3 
you leap: I 
jumped out 
of the frying pan into the fire. 
lThey say, half a 
loaf, is 
better than none at all: but I 
N " 
nted a 
whole loaf, so I 
Ni 
threw away dirty water before I 
got clean. 
They say, 
two heads are better than one, so I 
took a 
wife, and caught 
a 
tartar, and found two of a 
trade could never agree, and 
proved the proverb, that marry in haste, repent at leisure. 
They say, beauty is but skin deep, but ugliness is deeper. 
If beauty is but skin deep, what a 
fool a 
man mustbe to skim 
all the cream off the milk, and leave nothing but the curd 
to sour in his own stomach. But I'm not unhappy, Oh no! 
for I 
know it can't last. , 
For I 
never meet troubles half way, 
Or fret after things that are past, 
If bad luck comes in the way, 
I'm happy, hecau,selt can't last.

HIPPY MIN, OR IT CAN'T LIST. 
INTO got neither houses nor land, 
Nor Money in funds or in purse, 
My furniture's not very grand, 
Some think my position a 
curse •, 
I'm threadbare, I'm hampered with strife, 
On every toe I've got corns, 
I've a 
devil that law calls a 
wife, 
And the neighbors/all say I've got horns. 
Spoken. 
Yes, I've a 
wife; my wife's got a 
tongue ; well, I 
know 
it, it is a 
tongue; it's a 
night tongue, it's a 
day tongue, in 
fact, it's a 
perpetual tongue; it hangs on a 
swivel, wags 
at both ends; then she keeps a 
poll parrot to help her out 
with it, and when she's hard pushed she'll tread on the cat's 
' 
tail to raise an extra squall, and knock ddwn the fire-irons 
by way of an accompaniment. 
Then, there's my home, it 
is a 
home. My home resembles a 
battle of confusion. 
A 
hundred school boys playing in a 
court; in fact it's like an 
ashman's bell on one side of my ear, and a 
postman's on 
the other. 
I 
am not unhappy, no, damn it, it can't last. 
For I 
never, etc. 
Now, if I 
speak but a 
word of my mind, 
By way of concluding my song, 
I 
hope you will all be so kind . 
As to think that I 
don't instance wron,g ; 
To see you all round me so gay, 
Is the happiest moment I've past; 
But when you are all gone away, 
I 
shall be happy, because it can't last. 
Spoken. 
What different creatures women are before marriage to 
what they are after it. 
Now, my wife before marriage 
was as sweet and welcome to me as the first flower in spring; 
but as soon as the sun of matrimony shone on her she be-
came as changeable as tulips, proud as the poppy, thorny

nettle, hot as horseradish, deadly as night-shade, as wan-
ton as the ivy; dnd as destructive as slugs. 
There was 
no pleasing her, nor no hoeing her. 
She was, too deep to be 
dug up. 
I 
couldn't lop her, the law wouldrft wop her, - 
then she'd run to seed every year, and the little seedlings 
were as wild as the parent stem. 
They'd neither trans-
plant nor cultivate them. 
There's my home it is a

My home resembles an hospital. 
Poor 
little Tommy has 
been bit Ily a mad dog,' poor little Harry he's broke his 
leg, poor little Fanny she's got the scarlatina, poor little 
Polly she's got the whooping cough, and the blessed baby's 
got the measles, and I 
expects myself to have the ' small 
pox shortly, and through my wife's ways we are reduced 
to one room, and that' smoked, but where there's a 
will 
there's a 
way. 
If the room smokes, put the fire out, if the 
children begin to squall, put them out, and if your wife be-
gins to blow up, put on your hat and go out yourself—it

PADDY IS Lai, BOY THAT IS FOND OF A 
LASS. 
As sung by SAM COLLINS and ToNy PASTOR. 
It is some years ago, I 
very well know, 
Since I 
first saw daylight with my two blessed eyes,— 
While my dad was away I 
was born, so they say, 
On St. Patrick's day in the morning; 
How they nursed me with joy and said, " what a 
fine boy! 
Put a 
stick in my hand by the way of a 
toy; 
Faith! there's no mistake, they admired my make, 
And said, some day I'd give some one a 
warming. 
But Paddy is the boy that is fond of a 
lass, 
Paddy is the boy that is fond of a 
glass; 
And dear old Ireland's the place for me, 
But Donnybrook's the place to go for a 
spree. 
Then I 
grew a 
big boy, and did praties destroy, 
And my old mother said I 
would make a 
fine boy; 
IT'S A WAY THE GIRLS IJAVE GOT. 
Indeed, it's no joke; she the truth only spoke, 
To be a 
genius I 
had given warning. 
'Twas after the girls with their elegant curls, 
And, like 'a 
true Irishman, the shillelah could twirl; 
And the girls, do you see, took a 
liking to me, 
But the dear creatures to harm, I'd be scorning. 
But Paddy is the boy-, 
etc. 
At a 
wake or a 
fair, poor Paddy is,there, 
And will fight friend or foe if they do him offend, 
Let the piper strike up he will rise from his cup, 
A smile on his fair face adorning. 
With his little COLLEEN, 
lie will dance on the green, 
Sure, an Irishman there in his glory is seen; 
Give him a 
reel or a 
jig, and he don't care a 
fig, 
But will dance till daylight in the morning. 
But Paddy is the boy, etc. 
Now, boys, do you mind, you never will find 
Such a 
dear little spot as that over the way; 
Long, long may it stand, good luck to the land, 
That dear old St. Patrick was born in. 
May the girls young and old, may the boys brave and bold, 
Unite heart and hand, to protect the dear Isle. 
And morn noon, and night, may joy and delight, 
Shine on ;hem like a 
sunshiny morning. 
But Paddy is the boy that is fond of a 
lass, 
Paddy is the boy that is fond of a 
glass; 
And dear old Ireland's the place for me, 
But Donnebrooles the place to go for a 
spree. 
IT'S A. WAY THE GIRLS HAVE GOT. 
Written by Fiterrx 
Sung by TONY PASTOR. 
Mrt--L" The Young May Moon." 
The ladies they say that men have strange ways, 
And the compliment we may well return; 
Have they not curious ways, these days? 
See it we can wherever we turn.

IT'S A. 
WAY THE GIRLS HAVE GOT. 
But I'm no critic upon the fair, 
Let others condemn them, I 
will not, 
I 
merely think when they act outre,i 
It's only a 
way that the girls hav6 got. 
Chorus. 
The ladies, I 
fancy them all divine, 
If they have curious ways or not, 
It is no business at all of mine, 
No, it's only a 
way that the girls have got. 
Now I 
went with a 
charmer to Sydenham show, 
Returning, into an hotel we went; 
After chops, to drink wino she wasn't slow, 
And nearly two pounds in cash I 
spent. 
Then she met some lady-friends, and said 
I 
must treat them too; I 
did, like a 
shot; 
And merely thought, as I 
scratched my head, 
Well, it's only a 
way that the girls have got. 
The ladies, 1 
fancy, etc. 
The girls don't exactly make love to us, 
But they're precious good at drawing us on; 
We men make with them a 
good deal of fuss, 
And expend our money the damsels upot 
We think of their hearts we're quite secure, 
But oft to be jilted is our sad lot ; 
That's not quite right us so to'allure, 
But its only a 
way that the girls have got. 
The ladies, I 
fancy, etc. 
Some may rail at the ladies' expensive dress, 
And the amplitude of their crinoline, 
And say, it brings husbands to distress, 
With milliners' bills extravagant seen; 
But beauty, you know, must be set off, 
Or else the men will worship it not ; 
So at ladies' finery I 
never scoff, 
For it's only a 
way that the girls hate got. 
The ladies, I 
fancy, etc.

DELICIOUS. 
When we are all of us married men, 
No doubt we speedily shall find out, 
That the fair sex will try to rule us then, 
However we grumble, flout, and shout. 
Well, perhaps its best, live better we may, 
And find our existence a 
pleasanter lot: 
So whenever men speak against women, I 
say, 
It's only a 
way that the girls have got. 
The ladies, I 
fancy, etc.

Chorus. 
By a 
female so delicious, 
A 
female so delicious, 
A female so delicious, 
And lovely for to view. 
The first time I 
saw this piece of goods 
She was coming down from Jones', Woods, 
In a 
one horse car, she looked so gay, 
She winked at me, and seemed to say: 
" 
Oh! don't I 
look delicious! 
I'm such a 
hunkey gal." 
Said I, " my dear, let's take a 
walk," 
So out the car we then did stalk; 
She said she liked to be caressed ; 
So she leaned her head against my breast. 
And did'nt it feel delicious ! 
I 
rather guess it did !

Said I, " let's have some grub to eat, 
I 
think it's time I 
stood a 
treat': 
Then into Taylor's we did bound, 
And codfish balls we had all round. 
And wasn't they delicious, 
And healthy for to take. 
When we got through we out did come, 
" 
My dear," said I, " I'll see you home;" 
" 
Oh I 
no," ;aid she, " you can't do that, • 
" 
My HUSBAND 'S such a 
jealous chap I 
And it wouldn't be delicious! 
If you and he should meet. 
" 
Madam," said I„X I 
am amazed 
That you've a 
husband—I 
am crazed ;" 
Said she, with a 
laugh, " Oh ! 'aint this sport ;— 
I've got you where your hair is short! " 
Oh 'aint this delicious! - 
Can't you see the point! 
I 
turned away—" hold on," said she, 
She winked at me mischievously: 
Sometime when you feel meek and mild 
Drop in and see my youngest child! 
For he is so delicious! 
He is so delicious ! 
He is so delicious! 
And looks just like his ma 1"

Said she, " you'll always be at war

In a

With a

The biggest boy thought me a

One day he gave me a

I 
bade him stop—he laughed at me, • 
I 
couldn't see the fun, 
So I 
poulticed him tremendously,— 
I 
looked out for number one. 
I 
grew to be a 
man at last, 
In business I 
did go; 
My partner he was rather fast,

I'll prove I 
wasn't slow. 
Said he, "you put yonr cash in stocks, 
Or we'll both be undone ;" 
But in the bank I 
salted my rocks,— 
I 
looked out for number one. 
On the very day I 
was twenty-six, 
Thinks I, I'll take a 
wife, 
Matrimony is the fix, 
To settle on in life; 
Arabella was rich, but old and sick, 
Maria poor, but young, 
Said I, " A.rabella, come kiss me quick,—

flow nate is Barney's cabin •, 0, how altered now his life 
Sure Barney now seems all himself, since I 
have been his 
wife. 
His linen now's as white as snow, and dacent all his 
clothes, 
No buttons off his collar now, nor great holes in his hose; 
The pratoes grow now twice as big, so maley, and so 
dry— 
The pig he grunts a 
sweet consent, with clean straw in 
his sty 
And Barney looks for all the world as if he'd die wid 
, joy— 
Throughout Colerain you'll sake in vain for such an Irish 
boy. 
Spoken. 
0, sure, marriage has made a 
might alteration wid the 
both of us; for Barney is quite alter'd, and so am I. 
What was he before ? 
Why, nothing but a 
single boy like 
myself; but the priest has made a 
man of both of us. 
Sure, there was nothing in the cabin but what was single 
as well as Barney !—there was only a 
single pane of glass 
in the window, and that was wood—there was only a 
single button on his coat, and that was in his.waistcoat 
pocket—there was only a 
single glass to drink the whisky 
out of, and that glass was a 
horn—there was only a 
single 
knife, fork, and a 
spoon, and the knife was miss-laid; the 
fork was lost, and the spoon wasn't to be found. 
There 
was a 
single shelf to hold the grub, but not a 
single bit of 
grub to go on the shelf—there was a 
double-breasted single 
double breasted, wid out back or fronts ;—och; and there 
was a 
lot of other things in the cabin for use what were all 
useless, and among them was Bar4"y. 
Arrah, sure, and 
didn't I 
soon alter that, for as soon as I 
paired with Bar-
ney, we paired everything in the house.

Now while we are agreeing we're neather of us cross, 
And while we gain contentment, sure we never find a

We struggle hard to make ends meet, we live in joy and 
peace; 
Things multiply abundantly, and keep on the increase. 
0, the joys of a

When it's not pother'd with strife; 
0, phat fools all thim are, who rangle and jar, 
And live such a

Sure, now, we are as happy as the day is long— and 
longer than that ; sure when the heart is full of contint, 
the cupboard can never be empty: so that we always have 
sufficiency for the day, if we don't get it till the next night; 
for Barney brings home all the wages he arns, besides 
what he expects to get. 
And every thing is on the in-
crease wid us,—the pig is inci-easing; the torn cat has got 
kittens, so he is increasing; I 
have got two fine daughters, 
and every man jack of them is like their father. 
Even

With my tooral be, etc. 
SPARKING IN THE KITCHEN . 
03 
In Broadway, near the Union Square, I 
was clerk unto a 
grocer, 
And every morning there for goods Miss Bell did go, sir; 
Her manners were so free, he set my heart a 
twitching, 
And she invited me to go see her in the kitchen. 
With my tooral loo, etc. 
Next Sunday being the day she promised me the flare up, 
I 
dressed myself quite gay, and frizz'd and oiled my 
hair up, 
As the lawyer's got no wife, he had gone that day a-
fishing, 
So we kicked up high life below stairs in the kitchen. 
With our tooral be, etc. 
Just as the clock struck six we sat down to the table; 
She handed tea and cakes— I 
eat while I 
was able, 
I 
drank hot punch and tea till my side had got a 
stitch in, 
And the hours flew quick away while sparking in the 
kitchen. 
With our tooral, loo, etc. 
With arms around her waist I 
kissed and hinted marriage, 
To the door in dreadful haste came Lawyer Brooks's car-
riage ; 
Her looks told me full well that moment she was wishing, 
That I'd been with Old Nick, or somewhere from the 
kitchen, 
With my tooral, loo, etc. 
Up off my knee she flew full five feet high or higher, 
And over head and heels threw me slap into the fire, 
My .bran new Shanghai coat that I 
bought from Mr. 
Stitchen 
For a 
thirty dollar note, was burned in the kitchen. 
With my tooral, loo, etc. 
I 
grieved to see my clothes all besmeared with smoke 
and ashes, 
Then a 
tub of dirty suds right in my face she dashes;

THE MYSTERIOUS TAILOR. 
As I 
lay upon the floor still the water she kept pitching, 
Till the lawyer burst the door, and walked into the 
kitchen. 
With my tooral loo, etc, 
The lawyer he got mad, though he saw my situation, 
And I 
was quickly marched off to the police station. 
I'd no one to give bail,lhough to get home I 
was itching; 
But-I 
should give some account how I 
got into the kitchen. 
With my tooral, loo, etc. 
I 
said she did invite me, but she gave a 
flat denial; 
For assault she did indict me, and I 
was sent for trial. 
She swore I 
ruined her character in spite of all her screech-
ing, 
So the judge gave me six months for sparking in the 
kitchen. 
With my tooral, loo, etc. 
THE MYSTERIOUS TAILOR, 
or 
Touching that Little Account 
Who says there ain't ghosts ?—I 
say that there are, 
And in all sorts of shapes they appear; 
Theie's one ghost that haunts me, at home or afar, 
As the mysterious tailor he's near. 
I'd order'd a 
suit of this horrible brute, 
At three months to square the account, 
When true on the morn came his hideous form— 
Spoken. 
With cadaverous look and demoniac eyes gazing hor-
ribly out from his sunken eyeballs, as, with fiendish grin, 
he said— 
" 
Touching that little account." 
THE MYSTERIOUS TAILOR. 
65 
"'Twasn't convenient just then," said I, somewhat vexed, 
At being so hard up for the cash. 
Says he, " No disappointment when I 
appear next," 
And he vanished away like a 
flash. 
But that very night I'd missed my way quite, 
While going round a 
place call'd the Mount, 
Tapp'd a 
man on the back, to ask the right track— 
'Spoken. 
'Twas the mysterious tailor, who grinned forth still more 
sardonically as he answered me in a 
low and hissing 
voice— 
" 
Touching that little account." 
Then I 
went in the country, to see an old aunt 
Who'd long kept me well in supplies, 
And tho' I 
tried hard on her 'fections to plant, 
The needful I 
douldn't then rise. 
I 
returned to my inn, in no gentle skin, 
To a 
two-bedded room soon did mount, 
.1Iad the nightmare till morn, when again that dread 
form— 
Spoken. 
There, in the next bed, sitting bolt upright, with a 
red 
nightcap on his head, was the mysterious tailor, who, 
stretching forth his bony hand, said— 
" 
Touching that little account," 
Not for worlds would I 
there for nice breakfast stay, 
For the wretch I'd liked to've knocked down. 
But eat up with the blues, for the train I 
made way, 
To whisk me again up to town. 
I 
raised train the first, my fates how I 
curs'd, 
And for solace my pipe tried to mount ; 
But the train soon arrived, in the carriage I 
dived— 
' 
Spokeiz. 
When—angels of death defend us 
almost set down 
in the lap of the mysterious tailor, who grinned out still 
more horribly, as he said— 
" 
Touching that little account."

66 
THE MYSTERIOUS TAILOR. 
Quite dejected in mind, I 
arrived back in town, 
With horrible thoughts at their height ; 
When to keep up my spirits, I 
pour'd spirits down, 
Until I 
got jolly well tight. 
Incapable quite, two policemen that night 
Did me on a 
stretcher soon mount •, 
In the morn, 'fore the mayor—Oh,1 didn't I 
stare— 
Spoken. 
There, beside his worship, on the bench, sat, the myste-
rious tailor, and as the magistrate said, " Fined five dol-
lars," in the glare of the fiend's eye I 
read—' 
" 
Touching that little account." 
I 
rushed from the court, and into the street, 
With visions of suicide rife, 
For strychnine and arsenic I 
in vain tried to treat, 
Determined to take my own life:-
So, at night in the river I 
plung'd with a 
shiver, 
But some one the bridge saw ine mount ; 
I 
was seized by the collar, when—Oh to my horror— 
Spoken. 
The mysterious tailor had got me tight in his bony grasp: 
I 
felt as if in the other world, among the Other ghosts, and, 
worst of all, the demon ghost of a 
tailor, who said, " This 
ain't the way 
" 
To settle that little Account." 
They soon brought me to, and again for the night 
I 
alept in a 
station-house cell, 
While the telegraph soon -put my friends in a 
fright, 
AS 
the rash act it speeded to tell. 
My aunt she relented, and I 
soon repented, 
As she doubled my yearly amount., 
Then, as Fortune I 
hail her, laid the ghost of a 
taller— 
Spoken. 
Who, as I 
paid him, smiled as if be were inwardly 
chuckling, and his visage told me he'd like to measure 
me again; and then haunt me with— 
" 
Touching that little account."

Why Aliould I 
call her mine? 
Her hair was light, her eyes were bright, 
Her dress a 
morning gown, 
A 
travling box stood by her side, 
• 
And on it Jemima Brown. 
I 
used to take her ev'rywhere, 
To all the sights in town; 
And then she left me in despair, 
Did naughty Jemima Brown. 
I 
used to take her, etc. 
At a 
baby-linen builder's, 
Where such little things were made, 
I 
next saw Miss Jemima, 
As past the shops I 
stray'd. 
She look'd the Queen of a 
sewing machine, 
And as I 
walked up-town, 
I 
used to stop and my dinner lose, 
To gaze at Jemima Brown. 
I 
used to take her, etc. 
I 
sought an introduction, 
Obtain'd it, all was right, 
At eight o'clock l'd meet her, 
And walk home ev'ry night. 
To seal our loves, I 
bought her gloves. 
-To Coney Island we went down, 
Took tea and clams, drank lager beer, , 
And waltzed with Jemima Brown. 
I 
used to take her, etc. 
JEMIMA. BROWN. 
One night I 
flew to meet her; 
The weather yet was warm, 
I 
saw her fondly leaning 
On a 
smart young fellow's arm. 
Against my will, I 
felt quite ill. 
Inquiring with a 
frown, 
" 
Who's that ?" " It's only Brother Bill," 
Said naughty Jemima Brown. 
I 
used to take her, etc. 
" 
I 
want to ask a 
favor, 
I 
hope you won't be cross, 
Or think it bad behaviour, 
But father had a 
loss; 
Would you kindly lend us fifty dollars, 
My brother he'll be bound." 
Of course I 
would, could I 
refuse 
My life to Jemima Brown ? 
I 
used to take her, etc. 
From that very day I 
miss'd her, 
Tho' she said she'd be my bride; 
From Brooklyn up to Albany 
I 
sought her far and wide. 
Years after that, when passing by 
A 
shop away up town, 
Midst heaps of greens, and kidney beans, 
There stood Jemima Brown. 
I 
used to take her, etc. 
She was weighing out potatoes, 
Throwing coppers in the till ; 
Three lovely children by her side, - 
The image of brother Bill; 
Her broken vow, I 
see it now, 
But not my cash so sound, 
That shop was BOUGHT, and I 
was SOLD, 
By naughty Jemima Brown. 
I 
used to take her, etc.

THE ORIGIN OV IRELAND. 
As sung by TONY PASTOR. 
Paddy O'Carrol." 
Wid all condescinshin, I'd turn yer attinshin 
To what I 
would minshun ov Erin so green; 
An' widout hesitashin I'd show how that nashin 
Became ov creashin the gem and the queen: 
It happened one mornin' widout any warnin' 
That Va,ynus was born in the beautiful say— 
An' be that same token (an' sure ' twas provokin') 
Her pinions wore soakin' au' wouldn't give play— 
So Neptune, who knew her, began to purshoe her, 
In order fo woo her— the wicked old Jew; 
An' he very nigh caught her, atop ov the water, 
Great Jupiter's daughter—a 
beauty to view. 
But Jove, the great janius, look'd down on his Vaynns, 
An' Neptune so haynus purshooin' her wild; 
So he roared out in tundher, to tare him asundher, 
An'_ sure ' twas no wonder for tazin' his child. 
So a 
star that was flyin' around him espyin' 
He seezed widout syhin', and hurl'd it below, 
Where it tumbled like winkin' on Neptine while sinkin', 
And gave him Jin Nunkin' a 
broth of a 
blow. 
And that star was dry land, both low lhni and high land, 
And formed a 
sweet island, the land ov me birth; 
Thus plain is the story, 'kase sint down from glory 
On Neptune the tory, was Erin's green earth. 
Thin"Vaynus jumped nately on Erin so stately, 
But faynted ' kase lately so bothered an' crissed; 
Which much did_ bewilder, but ere it had killed her, 
Her father distilled her a 
dhrop of the best— 
An' that glass so victorious, it made her feel glorious--
A 
little uproarious, I 
fear it might prove ; 
Thin how can you blame us, that Erin's so famous. 
For BEAUTY and MURDTHER, and WHISKY and LOVE.

BUT OF COURSE IT'S NO BUSINESS OF MINE . 
BUT OF CO1TRSE IT'S NO BUSINESS OF MINE. 
As 
sung by TONY PASTOR. 
I 
am not inquisitive, no! 
To say so, all I 
defy, 
Although a 
few things may know, 
Still I 
am not a 
pry; 
'Tis a 
nature of mine it is clear 
Other people's affairs to define, 
But never of course interfere, 
Because it's no business of mine. 
There's my neighbor Mr. Bill Green, 
flow he does it I 
really don't know, 
At two in the morning is seen, 
In a 
state most clearly, so, so' 
Seven weeks' rent he owes, so I heard, 
ills salary but ten dollars, I 
find; 
But I 
never utter a 
Word, 
Because it's no business of mine. 
In a 
shop one night I 
did see, 
I 
scarce could believe my own eyes, 
Mrs. D. of the next floor to me, 
With a 
strange man eating eel pies; 
The nhxt day I 
said, " Mrs. D, 
Are not eel pies very fine, 
Of course it's no matter to me. 
Because it's no business of mine." 
There's the collector every week 
Calling at number sixteen,' 
Tho' neighbors, as neighbors,pmr. speak, 
I 
say it's decidedly mean 
For a 
journeyman's wife, a 
lace shawl, 
Moire antique, and red crinoline,— 
I 
notice, say nothing at all, 
Because it's no business of mine. 
I AM SO VERY SHY. 
The landlord yesterday met, 
He said that it was his intent, 
Number five possession to get, 
And put in the brokers for rent. 
But I'm sd very discreet, 
A 
sensible practice is mine, 
What I 
hear I 
never repeat, 
Because it's no business of mine. 
Not that I'm inquisitive, no! 
But one thing I 
have to say, 
If I've pleased you, am anxious to know ? 
For directly I 
must go away. 
How it is that this music hall 
Pays. I 
cannot define, • 
Not that I 
interfere, not at all, 
Because it's no business of mine. 
71 
I 
AM SO VERY SHY. 
As sung by TONY PASTOR. 
AIR—" The happiest fellow out." 
Of all the ills with which our sex often are oppressed. 
Upon my word, I 
think bashfulness outbalances the rest; 
Others see enjoy themselves whilst I 
only sigh, 
Recause I 
am so bashful, I 
am so very shy; 
Yes, so shy, very shy, blushing, too, and sighing, 
Yes, so shy, very shy, etc. 
When I 
am in company, at soiree, ball or rout, 
I 
steal into a 
corner, peeping like a 
mouse about, 
Or if I'm asked to play, or sing by gentlemen, then I 
Have not nerve to speak or look, I 
am so very shy. 
Yes, so shy, very slit, etc. 
Expect of course I 
cannot, to reach the married state, 
When a 
little nerve I 
get, I 
fear ' twill be too late, 
If a 
gentleman this instant pop the question would, then I 
Could not look him- in the face, I 
am so very shy. 
Yes, so shy, very shy, etc. 
72 
im BO VERY SHY. 
Sometimes determined to be bold, I 
begin to feel so now, 
Would any gent just try me, proffer me a 
vow, 
To love me true, sincerely, I 
will not deny, 
I 
my bashfulness MIGHT conquer, not be quite so shy. 
Not so shy, quite so shy, will any gent be trying, 
Not so shy, quite so shy, etc 
My courage to the sticking-place will screw then I 
won't 
fail, 
A 
rusty, fusty, old Maid's life, I 
may not bewail, 
I'll be bold, and resolute: at once commence will 14 
So gentlemen, no offer to refuse you shall be shy. 
Here am I, Here am I, ready for an offer, 
Here am I, Here am I, will any gent just offer. 
WHEN SHALL WE 
THREE WMET AGAIN? 
• 
A 
Parody. 
When shall we three meet again ? 
When shall we three meet again? 
Often shall stage horses tire, 
Sick kittens nestle by the fire 
And hoptoads sing in pond and pool, 
And boys shall hooky play from school; 
Their clothes with ' lasses-candy stain, 
Ere we three shall meet again. 
Jeff Davis hang upon a 
tree, 
Contractors too, shall honest be, 
The ladies' hoops decrease in size, 
And Yankees give up punkin pies; 
Ganders shall cease to follow geese, 
And army sutlers cry for peat:e; 
A 
thousand wondrous things sball reign, 
Ere we three donkeys meet again.
