It is fast superseding all 
the antiquated Letter-W 
riters that have long out-lived 
their usefulness. 
So great is the sale of this excellent 
book that it may truly be said that since its publication, 
" 
Those write now who never wrote before, 
And those who always wrote, now write the more."

States, and a

See how damp my forehead's now; 
Oh, I 
see the angels coming, 
With bright garlands for my brow.

How happy would my life be, if Maggie were my 
Own. 
If Maggie were my own, and I

You sait you vas coming right hime from dat

De house is all dark, de fire's played out, 
Und we have noting to ate, 
Und Casper vas here, und he drank zwei glasa of

Und told me put dat down on de schlate.

Und before he died, he howled und he cried, 
Zo yust put dat down on de schlate. 
O'er the bright waves, love, floating were we; 
Light in thy fair hair played the soft wind, 
Gently thy white arms round me were twined 
And as thy song, love, swelled o'er the sea, 
Fondly thy blue eyes beamed, love, on me. 
Soon o 
er the bright waves howled forth the gale, 
Fiercely the lightning flashed on our sail; 
Yet while our frail bark drove o'er the sea, 
Thine eyes, like load stars, beamed, love, on me; 
Oh! heart awaken! wrecked on lone shore, 
Thou art forsaken! dream, heart, no more!

Roy's wife of Aldivalloch, 
Roy's wife of Aldivalloch, 
Wat you how she cheated me, 
As I

She said she lo'ed me best of any; 
But ah! the fause, the fickle queen,

Though she's forever left her Johnnie.

GOOD-BYE, SWEETHEART, GOOD-BYE. 
The bright stars fade, the morn is breaking, 
The dew-drops pearl each bud and leaf, 
And I 
from thee my leave am taking 
With bliss too brief, 
With bliss, with bliss too brief. 
How sinks my heart with fond alarms, 
The tear is hiding in mine eye: 
For time cloth thrust me from thine arms: 
Good-bye, sweetheart, good-bye! 
Good-bye, sweetheart, good-bye! 
For time doth thrust me from thine arms, 
Good-bye, sweetheart, good-bye! 
The sun is up, the lark is soaring, 
Loud swells the song of chanticleer; 
The lev'ret bounds o'er earth's soft flooring, 
Yet I 
am here, 
Yet I 
am here, yet I 
am here. 
For, since night's gems from heaven did fade, 
And morn to floral lips doth hie, 
I 
could not leave thee, though I 
said, 
" 
Good-bye, sweetheart, good-bye, 
Good-bye, sweetheart, good-bye." 
I 
could not leave thee, though I

" 
Good-bye, sweetheart, good-bye."

FINE OLD ENGLISH GENTLEMAN. 
I'll sing you a 
good old song, made by a 
good old pate, 
Of a 
fine old Eng ish gentleman, who had a 
old estate; 
And who kept up his old mansion at a 
bountiful old rate, 
With a 
good old porter to relieve the old poor at his gate, 
Like a 
fine old English gentleman, all of the olden time. 
His hall so old was hung around with pikes and guns and 
bows, 
And swords and good old bucklers, -which had stood 
against old foes, 
And 'twas there " his worship" sat in state, in doublet and 
trunk hose, 
And quaff'd his cup of good old sack to warm his good 
old nose, 
Like a 
fine old English, etc. 
When winter old brought frost and cold, he opened house 
to all, 
And though three-score and ten his years, he featly led 
the ball ; 
Nor was the houseless wanderer ever driven from his hall, 
For while he feasted all the great he ne'er forgot the 
small, 
Like a 
fine old English, etc. 
But time, though old, is strong in flight, and years rolled 
swiftly by, 
And autumn's falling leaf proclaimed the ol.l man—he 
must die! 
He laid him down right tranquilly, gave up life's latest 
sigh, 
And mournful friends stood round his couch, and tears 
bedim'd each eye, 
For a 
fine old English, etc.

THE SWEETEST OF THEM ALL. 
Written by Will S. Hays, of Louisville, Ky. 
As sung by Ella Chapman. 
I 
have met a 
charmer, she's sweet to gaze upon. 
When at first you see her face, you'll feel your 
heart is gone, 
She wears her dresses " en panier," and sports a 
waterfall, 
And of all the charming girls in town, she's the 
sweetest of them all. 
ClIORTIS. 
Oh my! oh dear! 
You may talk about your pretty girls, the fair, 
fat, short, and tall, 
But Nancy Ann Amanda Jane is the sweetest of 
them all 
She plays upon the piano, the jewsharp znd 
bazoon, 
And when she hasn't got a 
cold, sln,gs " Up in a 
balloon." 
She goes to balls and parties, and when her name 
0 
they call, 
The men all stop to look and see the sweetest of 
them all. 
Oh my! oh dear 
etc.

THE SWEETEST OF THEM ALL— Concluded. 
I 
asked her if she'd have me, she smiled and said, 
" 
You bet," 
And whispered gently in my ear, " we may be 
happy yet." 
There's going to be a 
wedding, sometime late in 
the fall, 
And I'm to be the better half of the sweetest of 
them all. 
Oh my! oh dear! etc. 
I'm going to build a 
mansion, with a 
big plate on 
the door, 
And put my name upon it, A. Junius Brutus 
Moore, 
I'm going to give a 
party and invite you folks to 
. 
call 
To see how happy I 
will be with the sweetest of 
them all. 
Oh my! oh dear! etc.

GIVE ME A 
COT 
IN THE VALLEY I 
LOVE. 
Give me a 
cot in the valley I 
love, 
A 
tent in the greenwood, a 
home in the grove, 
I 
care not how humble; for happy ' twould be, 
If one faithful heart will but share it with me. 
Our haunts shall be nature's own beautiful bowers, 
Our gems shall be nature's own beautiful flowers; 
All woo'd by the sunshine, and kissed by the gale, 
The proudest might envy our home in the vale. 
Lov'st thou to listen to music's sweet voice 1 
Then fly to the woods where the song birds rejoice, 
Or wouldst thou be free ? to the forest repair; 
The stag in its freedom bounds merrily there. 
When summer has gone, and winter's chill hours 
Have rifled the greenwood and blighted the flowers, 
Tho' ice-bound the brook, and snow clad the dale, 
The proudest might envy our home in the vale. 
20 
LEAF BY LEAF THE ROSES FALL. 
Leaf by leaf the roses fall, 
Drop by drop the springs run dry, 
One by one, beyond recall, 
Summer beauties fade and die. 
But the roses bloom again, 
And the springs will gush anew, 
In the pleasant April rain 
And the summer's sun and dew. 
CHORUS. 
Leaf by leaf the roses fall, 
Drop by drop the springs run dry, 
One by one, beyond recall, 
Summer beauties fade and die. 
So in hours of deepest gloom, 
When the springs of gladness fail, 
And the roses in their bloom, 
Droop like maidens wan and pale: 
We shall find some hope that lies, 
Like some silent germ apart, 
Hidden far from careless eyes 
In the garden of the heart. 
Leaf by leaf, etc. 
Some sweet hope to gladness wed, 
That will spring afresh and new, 
When grief's winter shall have fled 
Giving place to sun and dew— 
Some sweet hope that breathes of spring, 
Through the weary, weary, time, 
Budding forth its blossoming, 
In the spirit's silent clime. 
Leaf by leaf, etc.

LITTLE NELL, 
THE. HEROINE OF THE OLD CURIOSITY SHOP. 
They told him gently she was dead, 
And spoke of Heaven and smiled; 
Then drew him from the lonely room 
Where lay the lovely child. 
'Twas all in vain, he heeded not 
Their pitying looks of sorrow; 
" 
Hush, hush," he cried, " she only sleeps, 
She'll wake again to-morrow." 
CHORUS. 
She'll wake again, 
She'll wake again, 
She'll wake again to-morrow. 
They laid her in a lonely grave, 
Where winds blew high and bleak, 
Tho' the faintest Summer brthth Lad been 
Too rough to tan her cheek ; 
And there tne poor olo man would watch 
In strange tho' childish sorrow, 
And whisper to himself the 
She'll come again to-morrow. 
• She'll wake, etc. 
One day they missed him long and sought 
Where most he loved to stay; 
They found him dead upon the turf 
Where little Nellie lay ; 
With tottering steps he'd wander there, 
Fresh hope and strength to borrow, 
And e'en in dying, breathed this prayer, 
" 
Oh, let her come to-morrow." 
Oh, let her come, 
Oh, let her come, 
Oh, let her come to-morrow.

JENNIE SERTISHA JANE. 
As sung by Dave Reed. 
I'll tell you of a 
handsome girl, the prettiest ever 
seen, 
She's the master-peice of nature, she is fairer than 
a 
queen; 
She's the pride of this great city, and she's got 
the sweetest name, 
Oh! I'm in love, bead, neck, and heels, with 
Jenni e_Jerush a 
Jane. 
CHORUS. 
Oh ! my, she is a 
charmingbeauty, oh, dear, she's 
got the sweetest name, 
Hi! yi! to love her is my duty, handsome, pretty 
little pinky; Jennie Jerusha Jane. 
I 
met her on the Avenue, one sunny afternoon, 
And in passing by she gave a 
wink, I 
followed

You ought to see the people stare, they didn't 
know what to think, 
To see me promenading with this pretty little pink. 
Oh! my, she is, etc. 
(I) 
My place the fellows envied, the girls were jealous 
too; 
I 
know it by their actions—what I 
say to you is 
true, 
They tried to bluff and scare me off, but nothing 
could they gain, 
They couldn't win from me my love, sweet Jennie 
Jerusha Jane. 
Oh! my, she is, etc. 
Her eyes they are as black as jet, her teeth are 
white as pearls; 
Her hair is bright, and dark as night, and grace-
fully it curls, 
her cheeks are like the sweetest rose, her lips in 
crimson stain, 
Oh! she's a 
perfect little pet! this Jennie Jerusha 
Jane. 
Oh! my, she is, etc. 
I 
asked her if she'd have me, and would be my 
guiding star, 
She referred me to her mamma and likewise to 
her papa, 
They said that they were willing for a 
son-in-law 
to claim, 
And told me to be happy, with my Jennie Jerusha 
Jane.

THE FARMER'S BUT 
The sun had gone down beyond yon hill, 
And o'er 3 
on dreary moor, 
When, weary and lame, a 
boy there came 
Up to a 
farmer' s 
dooi — 
Saying; " Can you tell me, if any there be 
Can give to me employ, 
CHORUS. 
For to plough, for to mow, for to reap, for to sow, 
For to be a 
farmer's boy. 
"My father is dead, my mother is left 
With her five children small; 
And what is worse for mother still, 
Fin the eldest of them all; 
Though small I 
am, I 
fear no work, 
If you will give me employ. 
For to plough, etc. 
" 
If you cannot me employ, one favor yet I 
ask, 
That is, to shelter me this one night, 
From the cold winter's blast; 
At the break of day, 
I 
will trudge away, 
Elsewhere to seek employ." 
For to plough, etc. 
The farmer says: " We will try the lad, 
No further let him seek." 
"Oh, yes, dear father," his daughter cried, 
While the tears rolled down her cheek; 
" 
For him that can labor it is hard to want, 
Or elsewhere to seek employ." 
For to plough, etc. 
At length of years this boy grew up, 
This good old farmer died; 
He left the boy the farm he had, 
And his daughter for his bride. 
The boy that was is a 
farmer now, 
And he ofttimes thinks with joy, 
CHORUS. 
On the happy, happy day he came that way, 
For to be a 
farmer's boy.

THE GRAVE OF UNCLE TRUE. 
Beside the worn and moss grown rock, 
The ivy vine doth cling, 
And the blue-bird from the shadowy oak, 
Folds up his trembling wing; 
And there until the vesper hour, 
his song conies sweet and low— 
A 
requiem to the faithful heart, 
That slumbereth below.

Poor Uncle True, 
Poor Uncle True, 
And the lamps of heaven shine brightly- clown, 
On the grave of Uncle True. 
His pilgrimage on earth is done— 
His toil of life is o'er, 
And summer's gale, or winter's wail, 
Shall meet his ear no more. 
Death's shadow bides his sleeping form, 
And veils him from our view, 
But the spirit of the past still dwells 
'Round the grave of Uncle True. 
Poor Uncle True, etc. 
The chaplet wreathed by Gerty's hand, 
Of roses white and red, 
Unheeded in their freshness lie 
Above his lowly head 
And the evening cricket's chirp is heard, 
When falls the pearly dew, 
And the lamps of heaven shine brightly down 
On the grave of Uncle True.

Though quicksands beneath us, beneath us may

We cast, then, around us wit's keen piercing shaft,

THE SPRINGTIME OF LIFE — Concluded. 
Never heeding the ripples that pass by our side, 
Nor dream that still waters, still waters run deep. 
In the hey-dey of life, when with ardor we burn, 
Unobserved by ourselves oft the tide 'gin's to 
turn; 
Ah! then at some cost ' tis too often we learn, 
As age slowly on us doth creep, 
Our hark on its voyage should be well stored in 
youth, 
With a 
compass to steer by, whose pole should be 
truth, 
With white sails of wisdom well trimm'd, then 
forsooth, 
And look-out ahead, yes ahead we must keep; 
The God then above us our pilot will be, 
With faith our sheet anchor we'll venture to sea, 
Though the voyage may be long, safe in port we 
shall be 
If we mind that still waters, still waters run deep.

THE GAMBLER'S WIFE. 
Dark is the night; how dark! no light—no fire! 
Cold on the earth the last faint sparks expire; 
Shiv'ring, she watches by the cradle's side, 
For him who pledged his love—last year a 
bride! 
Hark ! ' tis his footstep !—No, ' tis past—'tis gone! 
Tick! tick! how wearily the time rolls on. 
Why should he leave me thus 1 
he once was kind, 
And I 
believ'd ' twould last—oh! how mad, how 
blind! 
Rest thee, my babe, rest on,—'tis hunger's cry ! 
Sleep, for there is no food: the fount is dry! 
Famine and cold their wearing work have done; 
My heart must break— and thou my child !— 
Hush the! clock strikes one! 
Hush! 'tis the dice box,—yes! he's there— he's 
there! 
For this he leaves me to despair; 
Leaves love—leaves truth—his wife—his child— 
for what 1 
The gambler's fancied bliss—the gambler's horrid 
lot! 
Yet I'll not curse him,— no; ' tis all in vain; 
'Tis long to wait, but sure he'll come again; 
31 
THE GAMBLER'S WIFE— Concluded. 
And I 
could starve and bless him, but, my child, 
for you, 
Oh, fiend! oh, fiend!—Husk! the clock strikes 
two! 
Hark! how the sign board creaks—the blast howls 
by. 
Moan, moan, ye winds through the cloudy sky. 
Ha! ' tis his knock! he comes, he comes once more; 
No, 'tis but the lattice flaps—my hope is o'er! 
Can he desert us thus 1 
he knows I 
stay, 
Night after night. in loneliness to pray 
For his return, and yet he sees no tear; 
No, no, it cannot be— oh! he will be here. 
Nestle more closely, dear one, to my heart, 
Thou art cold—thou art freezing— but we will 
not part — 
Husband —I 
die !— Father—it is not he, 
0 
God! protect my child—Hush! the clock strikes 
three— 
They're gone—the glimmering spark bath fled— 
The wife and child are number'd with the dead; 
On the cold earth, outstretch'd in solemn rest, 
The babe lies frozen on its mother's breast— 
The gambler comes at last, but all is o'er, 
Dread silence reigns around, the clock strikes 
four.

LITTLE EVA TO HER PAPA. 
From the Drama of Uncle Tom's Cabin. 
When your daughter's taken away, 
And your heart is filled with care; 
When with angels I 
shall pray, 
For your peace and comfort here, 
Shall poor Uncle Tom be free 7 
Papa, promise this to me. 
When your little Eva's there, 
Robed like those in spotless white, 
And the conquering palm I 
bear, 
Blessed with love and heaven's light, 
Shall poor Uncle Tom be free ? 
Papa, promise this to me. 
Wife and children, send him near, 
When forever I 
am gone; 
Papa, check the falling tear, 
Think upon my dying song; 
Uncle Tom, oh, make him free, 
Papa, do for me, for me!

I'M HAPPY AS THE DAY IS LONG-
Pin happy as the day is long, 
All care unto the winds I 
throw, 
And glad as the summer is my song; 
Would any one the reason know ? 
'Tis because I'm neither rich nor poor, 
No parasites around me throng, 
But friends whose friendship will endure, 
So I'm happy as the day is long. 
CIIORUS. 
I'm happy as the day is long, 
And my happiness I

Would any one the reason know ? 
'Tis because I'm neither rich nor poor. 
So take things easy, it is best : 
Those who like me, I 
like them, too; 
But there's one I 
prize above the rest: 
Who it is ? I 
shall not tell you. 
Be sure I 
have no wish to roam, 
Fast anchored by affection strong 
Within the ha!bor of my home 
Where I'm happy as the day is long. 
I'm happy as the day is long, etc. 
In life, I 
have enough to do; 
Contented am I 
with my lot. 
My wants, to be sure, are but few; 
So the great ones I 
envy not; 
For, when I 
look below my state, 
On the children of want and wrong, 
My grateful soul is all elate, 
And Fm happy as the day is long. 
I'm happy as the day is long, etc.

THE WAX-WORK SHOW. 
By Alfred Lee. 
You haven't seen the wax-work show? then pay your 
money down, 
I wouldn't have you miss a 
sight like this for half a 
crown, 
It's worth the money just to hear the gentleman ex-
plain, 
And, if you're not pleased, ask us for your money back 
again. 
Commencing with our English queens, the first is good 
Jane Shore, 
The next one is fair Rosamond, and her behind the door 
Is Lady Jane Grey, in the tower, a—reading by a 
lamp, 
Inventor of the tamed Queen's head, or penny postage. 
Stamp. 
SPOKEZ4.—H i, hi, step inside! 
CHORUS. 
Then strike the gong and beat the drum, and blow the 
German band, 
The wax-work exhibition is the glory of the land, 
As large as life and twice as good, then step inside and 
see 
The kings and queens a 
dwelling like a 
happy familee.

The next is Charles James Fox, who blew up parliament 
one day, 
Guy's Hospital was built upon the ruins, people say; 
Next Joan of Noah's Ark, an English maiden in her 
prime, 
It's from a 
photograph by Mayan, taken at the time;

36 
THE WAX-WORK SHOW.—Continned• 
The other's Mary, Queen of Scots, or else it is John 
Bright, 
We're not sure which, our figures somehow got mixed 
up, one night; 
The next's a famous pugilist, his name I 
think's John 
Knox, 
Ths,-f. 
Shakespeare, author of the tragedy of Box and 
Cox. 
SPONEN.—Step up, they're all alive—alive. 
Then strike, etc. 
The merry monarch, Charles the First, you'll notice 
dressed in red, 
Folks made fun of him all his life, and then took off his 
head; 
The kind, good Duke of Gloster, who became old. Dick 
the three, 
lie killed two princes, but he loved his mother, don't you 
see; 
Wat Tyler, that's the man who first invented, Who's 
your hatter ? 
King John the Chartist, who once signed a 
something, 
but no matter; 
Next, King Canute and Anne of Cleves, preparing to 
elope, 
And Washington, who first invented washing-days and 
soap.

THE WAX-WORK SHOW.—Concluded. 
Our room of horrors, if you'd see, please twopence extra 
ray, 
But if your nerves ain't very strong, you'd better keep 
away; 
First, that repulsive little boy, is Maser Johnny Green, 
He put the kitten in-the well, and stole a 
crinoline; 
His mother thrashed him for the deed, and, after her 
attacks, 
We managed to secure a 
neat impression in the whacks ; 
That hideous monster next to him, was taken during 
life, 
He asked a 
friend to dine—without permission of his 
wife. 
Then strike, etc. 
The next is Mr. Peabody, most terrible of men, 
Then cruel Guillotine, who first invented Gillott's pen ; 
Our room of horrors would not be at all complete, you'll 
say, 
Without the author of the last absurd sensation play; 
This strange, infernal-like machine (brings out two or 
three guns, fastened together), oft frightens folks to fits, 
And when it goes off; blows you into twenty million bits 
You'd like to see it work, perhaps—you wouldn't? well, 
then, go (guns go off ) 
And send your friends to patronize the famous wax-work 
show.

THE STAR OF LOVE. 
The star of love now shines above, 
Cool zephyrs crisp the sea, 
Among the leaves the wild harp weaves;

The star, the breeze, the wave, the trees 
Their minstrelsy unite, 
And all are drear till thou appear, 
To decorate the night.

Thou guiding star of love to me, 
,The star, the star of love to me. 
The light of noon springs from the moon, 
Tho' with a

O'er hill and grove, like woman's love, 
It cheers us on our way; 
Thus all that's bright, the moon, the night, 
The heavens, the earth, the sea, 
Exert their power to bless the hour 
I 
dedicate to thee. 
Thou guiding star, etc.

Nobly out flag flutters o'er us to-day, 
Emblem of peace, pledge of Liberty's sway; 
Its foes shall tremble and shrink in dismay,

Shall float forever where freedom may call: 
It shall be the flag of the free 
Emblem of sweet Liberty!

Here we will gather its cause to defend; 
Let patriots rally and wise counsel lend;

All nations honor our banner so fair. 
If to insult it a 
traitor should dare, 
Crushed to the earth let him be! 
Freedom and progress our watchword to-day; 
When duty calls, who dares disobey ? 
Honor to thee, thou flag of the free,

You can get a

I 
met her by the trickling brook, 
Young Jenny, fond Jenny; 
As fair as morn her gentle look, 
Young Jenny, fond Jenny; 
'Twas golden bright her falling hair, 
A sparkling sunbeam nestled there, 
And free from sorrow, free from care, 
Was young Jenny, fond Jenny, 
Oh! her step was like a 
fawn, so fleet, so fleet ! 
And her eyes like early dawn, so sweet I 
so sweet! 
Oh! her step was like a 
fawn, so fleet I

And her eyes like early dawn, so sweet ! so sweet! 
When first the sky-lark peals his song, 
Young Jenny, fond Jenny; 
Through the meadows bounds along, 
Young Jenny, fond Jenny; 
There's not a 
bird but knows her tread, 
The linnet meek, the robin red, 
Will chirrup and flutter o'er the head 
Of young Jenny, fond Jenny. 
Oh, her step, etc. 
I 
met her, but I 
knew not why, 
Young Jenny, fond Jenny; 
My foolish heart did naught but sigh, 
Young Jenny, fond Jenny; 
-Until at length our eyes they met,

WEE SNOW WHITE-
Sung by the author, Mr. Lawrence Graham, first Baritone 
of Kelly & Leon's Minstrels. 
Her face was as fair as the tracks of the snow, 
That lie 'neath a 
moon's pale beam; 
And her spirit as calm as lilies grow, 
By the margin of marvellous streams. 
Not a 
hawthorn spray, in the woods of May, 
But were dimm'd by a 
brow more bright, 
And so softly she shone in this world's rough way, 
That I 
called her my Wee Snow White, 
That I 
called her my Wee Snow White, 
And so softly she shone on this world's rough way, 
That I 
called her my Wee Snow White. 
CHORUS. 
Wee Snow White, with a 
raiment light, 
And a 
face as fair as May; 
Shone for a 
space like all things bright, 
And faded then away. 
But the flakes that were light as her fairy feet, 
And the snow that was fair as she, 
Were cruel alas to my snow-drop sweet, 
And bore her away from me. 
She droop'd and she passed with the wintry blast, 
Like the dream of a 
lost delight, 
And left but the memory, love, at last 
In my heart, of my Wee Snow White, 
In my heart, of my Wee Snow White, 
And left but the memory, love at last, 
In my heart of my Wee Snow White. 
Wee Snow White, etc.

STRIKE THE LIGHT GUITAR. 
Oh, leave the gay and festive scene, 
The halls of dazzling light, 
And rove with me through forest green, 
Beneath the silent night; 
There, as we watch the ling'ring rays ' 
That shine from eve: y 
star. 
I'll sing you songs of happier days, 
And strike the light guitar. 
tell thee how a 
maiden wept, 
When her true knight was slain; 
And how her broken spirits slept 
And never woke again .; 
I'll tell thee how the steed drew nigh, 
And left his lord afar; 
But if my tale should make thee sigh, 
I'll strike the light guitar. 
THE SUNNY HOURS OF CHILDHOOD. 
The sunny, sunny hours of childhood, 
How soon they pass away, 
Like flowers, like flowers in the wildvvood 
That once bloom'd fresh and gay; 
But the perfume of the flowers, 
And the freshness of the heart 
Live but a 
few brief hours, 
And then for aye depart. 
The friends the friends we saw around us 
In boyhood's happy, happy days, 
The fairy, fairy links that bound us 
No feeling now displays; 
For time bath chang'd forever 
What youth cannot retain, 
And we may know, ah never, 
These sunny hours again.

The stars are brightly glowing, 
The happy hours are flowing— 
Then comrades, why be going, 
Wine jolly hours remain'?

We wont go home till morning, 
We wont go home till morning, 
We wont go home till morning, 
And then we wont go home! 
We'll send all care a-flying, 
For why should we be sighing 7 
Each idle fear defying, 
We'll pass the bowl again! 
We'll pass the bowl again, 
We'll pass the bowl again! 
We wont go home, ets... 
From morn to night a 
rover, 
We wander half seas over, 
And live the while in clover, 
As happy as a 
king! 
As happy as a 
king, 
As happy as a 
king! 
We wont go home, etc. 
While drowsy heads are sleeping, 
Our fairest joys we're reaping, 
When midnight hours are creeping, 
Our heads are bright and clear! 
Our heads are bright and clear, 
Our heads are bright and clear! 
We wont go home, etc. 
0, night was made for gladness, 
So banish all our sadness; 
To think at all is madness— 
Then free and easy be 
Then free and easy be, 
Then free and easy be! 
We wont go home, etc. 
0, send around the chorus, 
While starry skies are o'er us, 
There's none can go before us, 
In jollity and fun. 
In jollity and fun, 
In jollity and fun! 
We wont go home, etc.

Oh! the sad brown leaves of autumn, 
All scattered by the wind; 
How mournfully they seem to share 
The fate of human kind; 
Heft of their parent branches, 
And cast upon the world 
To linger, fade, and perish 
Before the winter's cold ! 
Oh! the sad brown leaves, 
Oh! the sad brown leaves. 
Oh! the sad brown leaves of autumn, 
All fluttering away, 
And they flourished bright and greenly, 
It seems but yesterday ; 
Now tossed, and torn, and trampled, 
At the mercy of the blast, 
With not a 
trace remaining 
Of those beauties of the past. 
Oh! the sad brown leaves. 
Oh! the sad brown leaves of autumn, 
Strewn by the lone way-side, 
Or blown upon the river's brink, 
Or drifting with the tide ; 
Whenever I 
behold them, 
I 
greet them with a 
sigh; 
They warn me by their presence 
That winter draweth nigh.

" 
I'll sit at the window," said Granny, 
And watch the garden gate, 
For I 
fancy that idle lad, sailor Dick, 
Will write to my bonny Kate; 
For she's moped and sighed all day, 
Since the ships were sent away, 
And early or late she looks at the gate, 
For the post, I'll be bound to say, 
For the post, I'll be bound to say. 
But the twittering swallows under the eaves' 
Looked laughing from their nest; 
For the birds and bees, and sighing trees, 
Soon whispered Granny to rest,

Kate heard the postman's tread, 
Past Granny's closed eyes she seiz'd her prize,

SHE WEPT HER LIFE AWAY. 
We loved her as our own poor child— 
The child we'd loved for years— 
We treasured her with fondest care,

And kissed away her tears. 
She strove to seem contented, 
Whilst we cheered her through the day, 
But when alone at night, poor child, 
She wept her life away.

She wept her life away, 
When alone at night, poor child, 
She wept her life away. 
She died when summer came, poor child—. 
The child we could not save— 
And hardly mourning that she slept, 
We laid her in the grave; 
She never could forget the day 
her lamented mother died; 
They could not live apart, poor child, 
They slumber side by side.

snort THE CELLAR. 
Old Simon the Cellarer keeps a 
rare store 
Of Malmsey and Malvoisie, 
And Cyprus, and who can say how many more ? 
For a 
chary old • oul is he. 
Of Sack and Canary he never doth fail, 
And all the year round there is brewing of ale; 
Yet he never aileth, he quaintly cloth say, 
While he keeps to his sober six flagons a 
day; 
But ho, ho, ho, his nose doth show 
How oft the black Jack to his lips doth go. 
Dame Margery sits in her own still room, 
And a 
matron sage is she; 
From thence oft at Curfew is wafted a 
fume, 
She says it is" Rosemarie." 
But there's a 
small cup-board behind the back stair, 
And the maids say they often see Margery there. 
Now Margery says that she grows very old, 
" 
And must take a 
something to keep out the cold." 
But ho, ho, ho, old Simon doth know, 
Where many a 
flask of his best doth go, 
Old Simon reclines in his high-bakk'd chair, 
And oft talks about taking a 
wife; 
And Margery is often heard to declare, 
" 
She ought to be settled in life." 
But Margery has (so the maids say) a 
toner, 
And she's not very handsome, and not very young: 
So somehow it ends with a 
shake of the head, 
And Simon he brews him a 
tankard instead; 
While ho! ho ! ho I 
he will chuckle and crow, 
What! marry old Margery "! no! no! no I

PAUL VANE. 
ANSWER TO LORENA. 
The years are creeping slowly by, dear Paul, 
The winters come and go : 
The winds sweep past with mournful cry, Dear Pau!, 
And pelt my lace with snow; 
But there's no snow upon the heart, dear Paul, 
'Tis summer always there; 
Thus early loves throw sunshine over all 
And sweeten mem'ries dear. 
I 
thought it easy to forget, dear Paul, 
Life glow'd with youthful hope: 
The glorious future gleamed yet, dear Paul, 
And bade us clamber up. 
They fmwning, said, It must not—cannot be! 
Break now the hopeless bands! 
And, Paul, you know how well that bitter day 
I 
bent to their commands ? 
I've kept you ever in my heart, dear Paul, 
Thro' years of coed and ill; 
Our souls could not be torn apart, dear Paul, 
They're bound together still. 
I 
never knew how dear you were to me 
Till I 
was left alone; 
I 
thought my poor, poor heart would break the day 
They told me you were gone. 
Perhaps we'll never, never meet, dear Paul, 
Upon this earth again! 
But there—where happy angels greet, dear Paul, 
You'll meet Lorena there. 
To rether up the ever shining way, 
We'll press with hoping heart— 
Together thro' the bright eternal day, 
And never more to part.

THE PEANUT GIRL. 
Now gather round me, colored folks, 
And listen to my ditty, 
It's all about a 
lubly gal, 
She libed in dis great city; 
Oh, she libed wid her mudder up seben pair 
Ob stairs, in de Bowery street, near Grand, 
But her business place was on Broadway, 
Where she kept a 
peanut stand. 
There was a 
young policeman smiled on her, 
And he bought her peanuts too, 
And she fell in lub wid his German silber star, 
And his lubly coat ob blue. 
Dey lubed each oder like de Shanghai 
Fowls dat walk about in spring, . 
And he took her up to Jones' wood, 
To hear de Dutchmen sing. 
She vowed she'd lub him ebermoro, 
And ne'er from him would stray; 
But she shook him and left wid an organ 
Grinder, de boys all call him old dog Tray. 
Dey gib curb stone concerts on rainy days, 
Which hab giben de young gal, a 
bad cough; 
And de jealous young policeman in rebenge, 
When he sees dem, he hollers: Walk off.

JEANNETTE AND JEANNOT. 
You're going far away, far away from poor Jeannette; 
There is no one left to love me now, and you, too, may 
forget; 
But my heart will be with you, wherever you may go; 
Can you look me in the face, and say the same to me, 
Jeannot ? 
When you wear the jacket red and the beautiful cockade, 
Oh, I 
fear that you'll forget all the promises you m ide; 
With a 
gun upon your shoulder, and your bayonet by 
your side, 
You'll be taking some proud lady, and be making her 
your bride. 
You'll, etc. 
• 
Or, when glory leads the way, you'll be madly rushing on, 
Never thinking if they kill you that my happiness is gone; 
If you win the day perhaps a 
general you'll be: 
Tho' I'm proud to think of that, what will become of me? 
Oh, if I 
were Queen of France, or still better, Pope of 
Rome, 
I'd have no fighting men abroad, no weeping maids at 
home; 
All should be at peace; or if kings must show their 
flight, 
Why, let them who make the quarrels be the only men 
to fight. 
Yes, let, etc.

61 
JEANOT'S ANSWER. 
Cheer up, cheer up ! my own Jeanette; tho' far 
away I 
go, 
In all the changes I 
may see, I'll be the same 
Jeanot: 
And if I 
win both fame and gold, ah ! be not so 
unkind 
To think I 
could forget you in the home I 
leave 
behind. 
There's not a 
lady in the land, and if she were a 
Queen, 
Could win my heart from you, Jeanette, so true 
as you have been, 
They must have gallant Warriors; chance had 
cast the lot on me; 
But, mind you, this soldier, love, must no deserter 
be. 
Why, since the world began, the surest road to 
fame 
has been the field where men unknown might win 
themselves a 
name; 
And well I 
know the brightest eyes have all the 
brighter shone, 
When looking at some warrior bold, returned from 
battles won, 
And you'd put an end to deeds which ladies love 
so well, 
And have no tales of valor left for history to tell ! 
The soldier's is a 
noble trade, Jeanette; then 
rail no more, 
Were only kings themselves to fight, there'd be 
an end to war!

how well I 
recollect the night 
We strolled along the dell; 
While chaste and pure the moon's pale light 
O'er tree and flow'ret fell. 
Our glances left this dull, cold earth, 
To gaze on heaven above, on heaven above; 
Ah, we felt 'twas there our thoughts had birth, 
We felt 'twas thence, ' twas thence came love, 
We felt 'twas thence came love! 
Between us now the tide of woe 
Its murky waves may roll; 
It may divide us here below, 
But not part soul from soul. 
Most surely we shall meet again 
In yon blue heaven above, in heaven above: 
Ah, and find life's weary trials o'er, 
The paradise of love, of love, 
The paradise of love.

Absent from home, parted fron thee, 
Deep in my soul the grief lingers yet; 
Parted from thee, deep in my soul the grief 
lingers yet; 
Weeping, the thought comes back to me— 
Joys of my youth which I 
ne'er can forget, 
O'er our loved home, spring lingers yet, 
Sunshine and blossom gladden the hours; 
But winter's gloom clings to me, clings to me 
here, 
Scatters the blossoms, scatters the blossoms and 
tears are its showers! 
Summer will come, all will be glad, 
Thou wilt rove on where together we roved, 
All will be glad, thou will rove on where to-
gether we roved; 
Say, will the scene seem to thee sad, 
Missing one, so dearly you loved'? 
Summer will come spring lingers yet 
Time may have 
come, 
and I 
be forgot; 
But the winter's gl
oom clings to me, clings to me 
still, 
Sunshine is darkness, sunshine is darkness, sun-
shine is darkness, where thou art not. 
Out in the streets, forsaken, alone, 
No home to shelter me, friendle!s, unknown, 
Weary of life, with its sorrows and cares, 
Sick of its many temptations and snares; 
Day follows day, yet I 
find no relief, 
No one to pity my sadness and grief. 
No gentle form lingers near when I 
sleep, 
Even the stars seem to smile when I 
weep. 
CHORITS. 
Angel of mercy, I 
wait on thee now, 
Death's chilling fingers are laid on my brow; 
Charity sheds bitter tears when she meets 
A 
poor lifeless wanderer " Out in the streets." 
Out in the streets, this pitiless night, 
Why need I 
watch for the coming of light ? 
Willing I'd part with this quivering breath, 
Gladly I'd welcome the angel of death. 
Why is it sinful to plunge in that stream ? 
Life is to me, but a 
dark troubled dream, 
Yet if I 
wait for my summons to come, 
Angels will bear me away to my home.

THE OLD FARM-HOUSE. 
Oh, the old farm house, down beside the valley 
stream, 
Where in childhood so oft I 
have played, 
Ere sorrow had clouded my heart's early dream, 
Or life's purest joys had decayed; 
How well I 
remember the vine-covered roof, 
And the rose-bushes clustering nigh, 
And the tall stately poplar trees standing aloof, 
Whose tops {seemed to reach to the sky. 
Oh, the old farm-house my childhood's happy 
home. 
Oh, the old farm-house, how I've sported round 
its hearth, 
With my sisters and brothers so dear k 
How oft has it rung with our innocent mirth, 
And hallowed our soft evening prayer; 
But the old farm-house now is bowing to decay, 
Its stones, like dead friends, lie apart; 
But its dear cherished image shall ne'er fade--
away 
From affection's domain in my heart. 
Oh, the old farm-house, my childhood's happy 
home.

ONE KISS, AND NOW GOOD NIGHT. 
Fond memory oft will backward glide 
When, I 
a 
child so free, 
At evening, fondly stood beside 
A 
tender mother's knee; 
With gentle hand she stroked my head 
With feelings of delight, 
As with a 
loving voice she said, 
One kiss, and then good night. 
But pleasures like the flowers that blow, 
Alas, too quickly fade; 
For in the silent grave-yard now 
My mother dear is laid; 
But though her form has passed away, 
I 
still with fond delight 
Believe I 
hear her softly say, 
One kiss, and now good night.

LITTLE EVA IN HEAVEN. 
From the Drama of Uncle Tom's Cabin. 
Childless, desolate this heart, 
Naught on earth is left to cherish, 
All is lost since we must part, 
Every hope and joy will perish. 
Eva, Eva! gentle daughter I 
Are those bright eyes veiled in death— 
That so fondly beamed with goodness 
Upon all at parting breath ? 
Art thou gone from me forever? 
Shall I 
never more behold thee ? 
Bud of life, my heart's fond treasure, 
What is now the world to me ? 
Lonely here and worn with sadness, 
No loved child's sweet voice : 
Life has ceased to yield its gladness, 
Since without my little dear. 
Eva, Eva! lovely daughter I 
Are those soft lips c.osed and cold— 
That so sweetly spoke of Heaven, 
Emblem of an Angel's mould ? 
Picture of divine perfection. 
Loved by all, enslaved and free; 
Oh! my heart and soul's affection, 
What is now the world to me! 
Home is silent, dread and drear, 
Uncle Tom is seen to weep; 
Topsey lingers near the bier, 
Strewing flowers at thy feet. 
Eva, Eva! charming daughter! 
Smile upon me from above, 
Open wide those gates a 
pearl, 
Bless me with thy spotless love I 
Little angel, thou art gone there, 
Filled at last thy prophecy 
Farewell, only child, forever! 
What is now the world to me ?

A LIFE ON THE OCEAN WAVE. 
Words by Epes Sergeant. 
Music by U, Russell. 
A 
life on the ocean wave, 
A home on the rolling deep, 
Where the scattered waters rave, 
And the winds their revels keep. 
Like an eagle caged I 
pine 
On this dull unchanging shore; 
Oh, give me the splashing brine, - 
The spray and the tempest's roar. 
A 
life, etc. 
Once more on the deck I 
stand 
Of my own swift gliding craft, 
Set sai/! farewell to the land 
The gale flows fair abaft. 
We 
shoot through the sparkling foam, 
Like an ocean bird set free— 
Like the ocean bird our home 
We'll find far out on the sea. 
A 
life, etc. 
The land is no longer in view, 
The clouds have begun to frown, 
But with a 
stout vessel and crew 
We'll say, let the storm come down. 
And the song of our hearts shall be, 
While the winds and the waters rave, 
A life on the heaving sea, 
A home on the bounding wave! 
A life, etc.

THE LITTLE MAID. 
There was a 
little maid, and she had a 
little bon-
net, 
She had a 
little finger, with a 
little ring upon it; 
And what's a 
little odd, her little heart, was then 
In love—but not a 
little with the best of little 
men. 
For the little youth had exercised his flattering 
tongue, 
And down before her little feet his little knees he 
flung; 
He pressed her little hand, and in her little face 
he gazed, 
And looked as if his little head had been a 
little 
crazed. 
Alas, her little lover did with little warning leave 
her, 
And she found him little better than a 
little gay 
deceiver; 
Then in a 
little moment, stifling all her little 
wishes, 
She took a 
little jump all among the little fishes 
Now all you little maidens, whose little love 
grows fonder, 
Upon the little moral of this little song may 
ponder; 
Beware of little trinkets, little men and little 
sighs, 
For you little know what great things from little 
things may rise.

My father dear, though years whirl by, 
Like leaves upon the blast, 
And hope's half shattered stem alone 
Remains to mark the past, 
There's still one spot, whence life's young spring 
Will never more depart; 
Where joy still lives forever green— 
A 
loving daughter's heart. 
Each smile of thine, each gentle word, 
Pronounced in happier times, 
has there struck root, and lived and grown 
Like flowers of eastern climes; 
Thus, age itself need never fear 
Bleak winter's icy dart, 
Ah, 'twill always find eternal spring 
Within a 
daughter's heart, 
Within a 
loving daughter's heart, 
A 
loving daughter's heart.

LEND A 
HELPING HAND. 
When flowers of fortuffe bloom around, 
And life sheds sunny rays, 
We'll share those blessings we have found, 
With friends of other days; 
Thus to relieve the aching heart, 
The means at our command, 
We each should gladly spare a 
part, 
And lend a 
helping hand, 
When troubles burthen those we know, 
Or tears of sorrow rain, 
'Tis then Nye can some aid bestow 
To ease the mental pain; 
For sympathy would soothe and cheer, 
Did we but take a 
stand 
Beside the couch of suff'ring near, 
And lend a 
helping band. 
Whatever be our rank on earth, 
'Tis well to recollect 
There's nothing in the pride of birth, 
Unless we win respect 
Some may be scared and turn away 
From poverty's sharp brand, 
But the dread foe we'll try to stay 
And lend a 
helping band.

SONG OF THE HAYMAKERS. 
The noontide is hot and our foreheads are brown, 
Our palms are all shining and hard; 
Right close is our work with the wain and the fork, 
And hut poor is our daily reward 
But there's joy in the sunshine, and mirth in the 
lark, 
That skims whistling along overhead. 
Our spirits are light, though our skins may be 
dark, 
And there's peace with our meal of brown bread. 
We dwell in the meadows, we toil on the sod, 
Far away from the city's dull gloom, 
And more jolly are we, though in rags we may be, 
Than the pale faces over the loom. 
CIIORITS. 
Then a 
song and a 
cheer for the bonny green 
stack, • 
Climbing up to the sun wide and high, 
For the pitchers and rakers, and merry hay-
makers, 
And the beautiful mid-summer's sky. 
Come forth, gentle ladies, come forth, dainty sirs, 
And lend us your presence awhile; 
Your garments will gather no stains from the burs,' 
And a 
freckle won't tarnish a 
smile.

field, 
Where freshness and health may be found, 
Where the windrows are spread for the butterfly's 
bed, 
And the clover bloom falleth around.

Hold fast, cries the wagoner, loud and quick, 
And then comes the hearty " Gee Wo !" 
Whilst the cunning old team horses manage to 
pick 
A sweet mouthful to munch as they go. 
The tawny-faced children come round us to play, 
And bravely they scatter the heap, 
'Till . the tiniest one all out-spent with the fun, 
Is covered up with the sheep-dog asleep. 
Old age sitteth down on the haycock's fair crown, 
At the close of our laboring day, 
And wishes his life, like the grass at his feet, 
May be as pure at its passing away.

LONG, LONG WEARY DAY. 
The long, long weary day is passed in tears away, 
The long, long weary day is passed in tears away, 
And still, at evening, I 
am weeping, 
When, from my window-height, I 
look out on the 
night, 
I 
still am weeping, my lone watch keeping, 
I 
still am weeping, my lone watch keeping. 
When I, his truth to prove, would trifle with his 
love, 
When I, his truth to prove, would trifle with his 
love, 
He says: For me thou shalt be weeping, 
When, at some future day, I 
shall be far away; 
Thou shalt be weeping, thy lone watch keeping, 
Thou shalt be weeping, thy lone watch keeping. 
Alas! if land or sea had parted him from me, 
Alas! if land or sea had parted him from me, 
I 
would not these sad tears be weeping; 
But hope he'd come once more, and love as be-
fore, 
And say: Cease weeping thy lone watch keeping, 
And say: Cease weeping thy lone watch "'keep-
ing. 
But he is slain and gone, whose heart was mine 
alone, 
But he is slain and gone, whose heart was mine 
alone, 
And now for him I'm ever weeping; 
His face I 
ne'er shall see, and naught is left for me, 
But bitter weeping, my lone watch keeping, 
But bitter weeping, my lone watch keeping.

KISSING THROUGH THE BARS. 
'Twas in a 
grove I 
met my love, 
One soft and balmy night, 
I 
owned my flame, she did the same, 
And trembled with delight. 
When at her gate we parted late, 
I 
blessed my lucky stars, 
And stole a 
kiss to seal our bliss . 
Between the wicket bars. 
I 
went again, but sought in vain 
The grove, my love to find; 
I 
feared the worst, and yet I 
durst 
Not think she was unkind. 
To solve my fate, I 
sought the gate, 
And there, oh, happy stars, 
I 
found and pressed her to my breast, 
And kissed her through the bars. 
I 
asked her why she did not fly, 
Like me on wings of love, 
To where our vows beneath the boughs 
Were whispered through the bars. 
She said of late the garden gate 
Seemed nearer to the stars. 
The hint was plain, and so again 
I 
kissed her through the bars. 
But kissing leads to graver deeds, 
And constant vision brings 
Of golden showers and orange flowers, 
White gloves and wedding rings. 
And now our fate, no envious gate, 
With wicked wicket mars, 
For wedded fast, we've learned at last 
To kiss without the bars.

LOVE A 
LITTLE rAMSEL. 
Words and Music by Bobby Newcomb. 
(The Music of this song is published by Oliver Ditson

I 
love a 
little damsel with a 
pretty little face, 
And she's jumped in my affections, in my heart 
she stole a 
place, 
She dresses neat and stylish, the men they sigh 
and stare ; 
She knows they're dead in love with her and yet 
she does not care, 
For I'm the one she fancies tho' you may not 
think it true, 
But if you knew our meeting place, you'd often 
see us two, 
I'm sure we love each other, and I'm her only 
beau, 
We've got a

CHORUS 
For the girls they are so very fascinating, 
Our affections they are always captivating, 
With their flirting and their pouting they deceive 
you, 
But really this is not the case with me. 
Her father he's an artist, her mother takes in 
Clothes, 
While my handsome little charmer, to help along, 
she sews.

you like to know? 
For the girls, etc. 
My heart is like a 
feather, I 
scarce know what to 
do, 
My sweetheart, like her lover, says she feels con-
tented too. 
But perhaps you'll slightly wonder what makes 
our spirits high, 
It is because we are engaged to be married by 
and by. 
Perhaps you'd like to see us when to the church 
we walk, 
For among the upper circles the match is all the

I

I SHOULD LIKE TO BE A FAIRY, OR PAPER 
WINGS. 
By T. IV. Charles. 
If wishes only would come true, 
How happy I 
should be, 
I've no wish in balloons to ride, 
Nor go beneath the sea; 
No doubt you'll think it funny, 
But of all unheard of things, 
I'd like to be a 
fairy with; 
A 
pair of paper wings. 
CHORUS. 
I 
should like to be a 
fairy, 
So graceful, light, and airy; 
Row nice to pe a 
fairy with 
A 
pair of paper•wing,s. 
If I 
had fairy wings, you know, 
I'd tease out of their lives 
Old bachelors and flirting men, 
Who wont make girls their wives; 
I'd hover round their haunts and show 
The joy a 
wedding brings, 
And try to touch their stony hearts 
With Cupid's fairy wings. 
I 
should like, etc. 
I'd try to show the wealthy few, 
The good they might insure, 
With fairy wings of golden hue, 
Amidst our starving poor; 
I'd teach them in sumptuous homes, 
That poverty oft brings 
The poor to lose its honesty 
Through want of golden wings. 
I 
should like, etc. 
We've all our different fancies, let 
Them be what'er they may, 
If we wish to do the heavy, why, 
Then, for it we must pay; 
So when upon the " fly," my boys, 
Your sprees and little flings, 
Just bear in mind that bank notes make 
The best of paper wings. 
I 
should like, etc.

THE OCEAN BURIAL. 
Oh! bury me not in the deep, deep sea! 
The words came low and mournfully 
From the pallid lips of a 
youth who lay 
On his cabin couch, at the close of the day; 
He had wasted and pined, till o'er his brow 
Death's shade had slowly passed, and now 
When the land and his fond loved home were 
nigh, 
They had gathered around him to see him die. 
Oh! bury me not in the deep, eleep sea! 
Where the billowing shroud. will swell o'er me, 
Where no light will break through the dark cold 
wave, 
And no sunbeams rest upon my grave! 
It matters not, I 
have often been told, 
Where the body shall lie, when the heart is cold, 
Yet grant, oh! grant this boon to me: 
Oh! bury me not in the deep, deep sea! 
For, in fancy I've listened to the well known 
words, 
The free wild winds, and the songs of the birds; 
I 
have thought of home, of cot, and of bower 
And of scenes that I 
loved in childhood's hour: 
I 
had even hoped to be laid, when I 
died, 
In the churchyard there on the green hill side: 
By the home of my father my grave should be; 
Oh! bury me not in the deep, deep sea! 
Let my death slumbers 
be where a 
mother's 
prayer 
And a 
sister's tear shall be mingled there;

THE OCEAN BURIAL—Concluded. 
It will be sweet, ere the gentle heart's throb is 
o'er, 
To know, when its fountain shall gush no more 
That those it so fondly hath yearned for, will come 
To plant the wild flower of spring on my tomb; 
Let me lie where those loved ones will weep over 
me; 
! 
bury me not in the deep, deep sea! 
And there is another whose tears would be shed 
For him who lay far in an ocean bed; 
In hours that it pains me to think of now, 
She bath twined those locks and bath kissed this 
brow, 
In the hair she had wreathed shall the sea- ser-
pent hiss 7 
And the brow she had pressed, shall the cold 
wave kiss 1 
For the sake of that bright one that waiteth for 
me, 
Oh! bury me not in the deep, *deep sea! 
She bath been in my dreams—His voice failed 
there; 
They gave no heed to his dying prayer, 
They have lowered him low o'er the vessel's side. 
Above him has closed the dark cold tide, 
Where to dip the light wings the sea bird rests, 
And the blue waves dance o'er the ocean crest, 
Where the billows bound and the winds sport 
free ; 
They have buried him there, in the deep, deep 
sea !

Where is now the merry party, 
I 
remember long ago; 
Laughing, round the Christmas fire 
Brightened by its sunny glow 
Or in :Summer's balmy evenings, 
In the field upon the hay 
They have all dispersed and wandered 
Par away, far away ! 
They have all dispersed and wandered 
Far away, far away! 
CHORUS. 
Far away, far away ! 
Where are all that merry party? 
Far away, far away! 
They are all dispersed and wandered 
Far away, far away! 
Some have gone to lands far distant, 
And with strangers made their home; 
Some upon the world of waters 
All their lives are forced to roam ; 
Some are gone from us forever_ 
Longer here they might not stay, 
They have reached a 
fairer region 
Far away, far away! 
They have reached a 
fairer region 
Far away, far away! 
Far away, etc. 
There are still some few remaininz, 
Who remind us of the past: 
But they change as all things change here, 
Nothing in this world can last; 
rears roll on, and pass forever, 
Wttat is eeTnine, who can say? 
Ere ?his closes— many may be 
Far away, far away! 
Ere this closes—many may be 
Far away, far away!

The light of other days is faded, 
And all their glories past, 
For grief with heavy wing hath shaded 
The hopes too bright to last; 
The world, which morning's mantle clouded. 
Shines forth with purer rays; 
But the heart ne'er feels in sorrow shrouded, 
The light of other days; 
But the heart ne .er feels, in sorrow shroude'l r 
The light of other days. 
The leaf which autumn tempests wither, 
The birds which then take wing, 
When winter's winds are past, come hithe:, 
To welcome back the spring; 
The very ivy on the ruin 
In gloom full life displays; 
But the heart alone sees no renewing 
The light of other days ; 
But the heart alone sees no renewing 
The Hula of other days.

SOME ONE TO LOVE. 
Some one to love in this wide world of sorrow, 
Some one whose smile will efface the sad tear, 
Some one to welcome the light of to-morrow, 
Some one to share it when sunshine is here. 
Oh, this world is a 
desert amid all its pleasures, 
And life seems bereft of its only true zest, 
If we fail in possessing with all its proud treasure 
The best of all blessings, some dear kindred 
breast. 
CHORUS. 
Some one to love in this wide world of sorrow, 
Some one whose smile will efface the sad tear, 
Some one to welcome the light of to-morrow, 
Some one to share it when sunshine is here. 
Some one to love, whose affection will cherish 
The sweet bud of hope, when 'tis blighted by 
care, 
Some faithful heart that will ne'er let it perish, 
By sinking forever in depths of despair; 
'Tis an angelic radiance, a 
beacon to guide us, 
Resembling those lamps that are shining above, 
'Tis a 
guardian from Ifeas'n, a 
light to decide us, 
Teaching us wisdom in letters of love. 
Some one to love, etc. 
101 
LINGER IN BLISSFUL REPOSE. 
Linger in blissful repose, 
Free from all sorrowing care, love, 
While round thee melody flows, 
Wafted on pinions of air, love. 
Let not thy visions depart, 
Lured by the stars that are beaming, 
Music will flow from my heart, 
While thy sweet spirit is dreaming. 
CHORUS. 
Dreaming, dreaming, unfettered by the day, 
In melody, in melody, I'll breathe my soul away. 
Softly the night winds are heard, 
Sighing o'er mountain and dale; love; 
Gently the vapors are stirred, 
Down in the shadowy vale, love, 
While o'er the dew-covered plain 
Starlight in silence is glancing, 
Lightly I'll breathe a 
refrain, 
Round the young heart that is dreaming. 
Dreaming, etc. 
102 
LORENA. 
The years creep slowly by, Lorena, 
The snow is on the grass again, 
The sun's low down the sky, Lorena, 
The frost gleams where the flowers have been; 
But the heart throbs on as wildly now 
As when the summer days were nigh; 
Oh, the sun can never dip so low 
Adown affection's cloudless sky. 
A 
hundred months have passed, Lorena, 
Since last I 
held that hand in mine, 
And felt the pulse beat fast, Lorena, 
Though mine beat faster far than thine; 
A 
hundred mon ths—'tw as flowery May, 
When up the hilly slope we climbed, 
To watch the dying of the day, 
And hear the distant chureh-bells chimed. 
We loved each other then, Lorena, 
More than we ever dared to tell; 
And what we might have been, Lorena, 
Had but out lovings prospered well! 
But then, ' tis past; the years are gone; 
I'll not call up their shadowy forms, 
I'll say to them: Lost years sleep on; 
Sleep on; nor heed life's pelting storms. 
103 
LORENA.—Concluded. 
The story of that past, Lorena, 
Alas, I 
care not to repeat; 
The hopes that could not last, Lorena, 
They lived, but only lived to cheat. 
I 
would not cause e'en one regret 
To rankle in your bosom now, 
For, if we " try, we may forget," 
Were words of thine, long years ago.. 
Yes, these are words of thine, Lorena, 
They burn within my memory yet, 
They touched some tender chords, Lorena, 
Which thrill and tremble with regret; 
'T was not thy woman's heart,that spoke, 
Thy heart was ever true to me; 
A 
duty, stern and pressing, broke 
The tie that linked my soul to thee. 
It matters little now, Lorena, 
The past is in the eternal past; 
Our heads will soon lie low, Lorena, 
Life's tide is ebbing out so fast— 
There is a 
future, oh, thank God! 
Of life that is so small a 
part; 
'Tis dust to dust beneath the sod, 
But there, up there, ' tis heart to heart !

THE FAIRY BOY. 
A 
mother came, when the stars were paling, 
Wailing round a 
lonely spring; 
Thus she cried, while tears were falling, 
Calling on the fairy king:— 
" 
Why, with spell my child caressing, 
Courting him with fairy joy, 
Why destroy a 
mother's blessing? 
Wherefore steal my baby boy ? 
" 
O'er the mountain, through the wild wood, 
Where his childhood loved to play, 
Where the flowers are freshly springing, 
There I 
wander day by day; 
There I 
wander, growing fonder 
Of the child that made my joy, 
On the echoes wildly calling 
To restore my fairy boy. 
" 
But in vain my plaintive calling; 
Tears are falling all in vain; 
He now sports with fairy pleasure; 
lie's the treasure of their train! 
Fare-thee- well, my child, forever! 
In this world I've lost my joy; 
But in the next we ne'er shall sever; 
There I'll find my angel boy !" 
105 
SUNNY DAYS WILL COME AGAIN, 
Though to-day be dark and dreary, 
And black clouds around us rise, 
Let us halt not, nor be weary, 
Light is looming in the skies. 
Aid and cheer each fellow creature, 
Against the Storms that round us tower, 
Soon they'll wear a 
brighter feature, 
And the sunshine come with power, 
CITOVITS. 
Never, boys, give way to sorrow, 
But be up and act like men, 
Look with hope for joy to-morrow, 
sunny days will come again. 
Let us throw aside all sadness, 
Better times are on the wing; 
Who can tell what joy and gladness, 
Providence to us may bring .? 
Nerve, then, every manly feeling, 
And with courage meet the storm, 
Let us wounded hearts be healing, 
And our duty still perform. 
Never, boys, etc. 
We should not be always sighing, 
Nor indulge in wild dismay, 
Bear in mind " Old Time" is flying, 
Therefore wisdom more display. 
If our prospects be not shining, 
And our hearts be bowed with care, 
Where's the good in our repining 
Still look up and never despair. 
Never, boys, etc

TEN CENT ROMANCES. 
It is the object of the publisher of this series of popular 
low-priced books, to present readers with a 
library of in-
tensely interesting fictions, based mainly upon real in • 
cklents— descriptive of Border, Indian, Trapper, and

complete novel of 
itself. 
Authors of first-class reputation will furnish the 
tales; which will far surpass in interest and graphic 
power any similar works ever published.

are laid in Southern Texas, the land of the rifle, the 
tomahawk, and the scalping-knife.

demon red skins and sees their painted faces.

brace of fine 
revolvers slung to his waist.
