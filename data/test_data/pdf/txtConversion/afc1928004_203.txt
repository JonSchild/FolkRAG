PREFACE TO RODY THE ROVER SONGSTER, 
IT 
would be well that the public who patronize our Panorama 
should understand the real facilities of our undertaking. 
We 
place Ireland on the stage in its true colors and really character-
istically, viz :—pure, simple, moral, social,, combined with sor-
row, misfortune. trouble, and down-trodden, as she is by an 
alien government. 
We exhibit her as though the last chord of 
her harp had been torn from its place ; and again we place her, 
if so, before the world as a 
nation, though do" n-trodden, glori-
ous; though in sorrow, proud, as it were, looking towards the 
utmost ends of the earth to seek her bereaved children in exile to 
her aid. 
And, lo! they hear her wailings and feel the pangs of 
her heart-stricken grief. 
they hear and rise ! and to promote 
their rising in her holy cause, we have, though in a 
very limited 
manner, sought to put her present blighted condition, condensed 
within the space of a few yards of canvass, and only inde.d 
pictured before the public 
Therefore we invite all to come and 
see In2land as she was, as she is, and as she will yet, please God, 
in whose good time " all things will be made well," be— 
" 
Great glorious and free 
First flower of the earth and first gem of the sea." 
RODY THE ROVER. 
The episode of Rody the Rover was put on the stage in con-
junction with the sceneries of Ireland to make more vivid the 
reality of Ireland and Irish peasant life. 
The author, indeed, 
has left nothing undone on his part to gratify the appetites of 
all who are anxious to know of how peasant life existed in Ire-
land. 
The episode is so well worked out that one would think 
the author could be none else than one born and reared up in 
the midst of the peasantry of Ireland, though gifted beyond the 
ordinary peasant with extraordinary talent ; whereas he was 
not, nor scarce ever saw the sacred land of Erin, though his 
parents were thoroughly Irish. 
Enough for the author; it will 
be for the press and the public to add to their already unani-
mous praise of an author and actor—Mr. JAMES A. GAvrN. 
The character of Rody the Rover is one of those which will be 
frequently found in Ireland—jocular, witty, amusing, and yet 
morally instructive; requiring an ac' )1' of superb qualifications 
to do it justice. 
llere, again, Mr. ', avin showed his good skill 
in selecting such a 
person to represent the humorous Body as 
Mr. John H. Ryan, of Dublin. 
Indeed the praises of this elo-
quent, humorous, witty, and pariotic young genius are too well 
known to need commendation. .: tiffice to say that whoever hears 
or sees him in the character of Rody the Rover, or any other 
[1] 
4 
PREFACE, etc.—[CONCLUDED. 
Irish character will add their testimony to the unremitting 
praises already awarded that gentleman. 
He has made it a 
study to avoid vulgarity, which so often, to the disgraceful 
shame of the performer or author is given to characterize an 
Irishman. 
In his aldresses to the young American widow lady 
this feature is well sustained ; and, nevertheless, though polite-
ness reigns ia his every movement, his courteous and witty, yet 
well-meant answers keep his audience in one continuous roar of 
laughter ; so to the end, Rody the Rover will please, gratify, en-
liven, and instruct, as it was originally intended to do, and those 
who see it once will be eager to see it again, that they might be 
possessed of something of real 
original fun and wit, of sound 
meaning, which, indeed, is truly characteristic of the Irish, so 
well personated by Mr. J. H. Ryan as Rody the Rover. 
It might not be inappropriate here to remark, that for the 
further advancement of genius in the vast" field of poetry and 
song" Mr. Ryan is about publishing a revised edition of his 
already well known collection of songs and poems, most of which 
are the productions of his own brain and the etchings of his pen. 
It is also his intention to add to his collection of miscellaneous 
poems, or " gems from the most popular authors of the day." 
We only sincerely trust that the encouragement manifested 
towards our young friend may be equal to the merit he so rich-
ly deserves, and we hope, also, that no man who would aspire 
to that noblest of all passions—patriotism, or no hoary old man 
who would have the days of his happy and vigorous childhood 
drawn out before him in the soul-stiring strains of poetry and 
music, or no youn , lover who would wish to win the object of 
his passion with honest pride, will leave their libraries minus of 
this ever-valuable little work. 
Then read and learn, that you 
may teach to all 
that what has so long slept in oblivion may 
now waken forth with revived vigor and unabating strength— 
that our native land—lreland—that " land of song" may at least 
look towards her exiled children with queenly pride and pro-
claim in joyous praises to the Most High— 
Now at least my death-sleep's o'er, 
My chains of bondage now are tore, 
By flashing steel and cannon's roar, 
And my exiled children home once more. 
The Saxons now will rue the day, 
They sought to close my earthly sway, 
For ' neath the sun of Freedom's ray, 
My sons have swept them far away.

A TOAST TO THE SONS OF IRELAND. 
Written in the Drama of" Terence O'Reilly and Kathleen O'iloore," 
expressly for J. H. RYAN, Comedian, by N. J. OMAHONY, of Cork. 
Ala:— " 
The Wearing of the Green." 
Here's to all the boys of Ireland, wherever they may be, 
In Ulster Leinster. Connaught, from Blackwater to the Lee. 
Here's to our gallant exiles, far front their native shore, 
Who sought to rend that cursed yoke, which hinds our country sore, 
Wheu our gallant chiefs were banded, and on the bills was seen 
Above them blazed undying, sure, the Green, our holy Green. 
CTIORUS. 
Then hurrah for old Erin, boys, hurrah ! hurrah! hurrah! 
TRW she's now in Saxon bondage, and God send we'll see the day 
That sweet freedom will forever reign, and in her breastserene, 
And liberty the motto of our good old Flag of Green. 
Here's the mem'ry of young Emmet, Sarsfield,Wolf Tone,O'Fourke, 
St. Lawrence St. Patrick, not for getting Edmund Burke, 
Joy, MacCracken, Napper Tandy, the Shearses and Jackson. 
Who died in famous '98 by the blac k- hearted Saxon. 
Here's to atvis, Moore and Curran, O'Connell, Swift— the Dean, 
Who wrote and sung and pray'd, my boys, for freedom to the Green. 
Then hurrah. &c. 
Though other nations claim the right of freedom's holy van, 
Let its prove we are no cowards, boys, and stand up to a 
man, 
To meet our country's foemen. the Saxon, steel to steel; 
Till at our charge they scatter, boys, and back to bell they reel; 
Till we burst our country's fett era, and shine out in stately mien, 
With our ancient banner flying, boys, our own, our darling Green. 
Then thurrah, &c. 
I 
have sung of ancient Ireland, her bar ds and heroes true, 
And of our own day, too, I've sung, forgetting only two 
Iarty's pastor. good and holy, or patriot Lavelle. 
The foisteen faue of Erin, and the Sogarth of the dell, 
And with him here's to Jim Stephens, oar patriot so great, 
Who baffled England's devils, boys, in dreary Forty Eight. 
Then hurrah for out Erin, boys, hurrah ! hurrah! hurrah 
Hurrah for gallant Stephens, and the Fenians of the day. 
And when the conflict's over, may on the field be seen, 
Our holy priest Lavelle, boys, proudly bearing up the Green. 
When sweet liberty is reigning on holy Ireland's shore, 
And peace and plenty dwell amongst her boys and girls, galore 
Then we'll toast our country's daughters, the fairest of the fair, 
The pride of nations proudest. and the dearest of the dear. 
Then here's to gentle Kathleen, and Eileen whom I 
love, 
The likeness of the angels, boys, and meeker than the dove. 
Then success to our Colleens, boys, we'll toast with a 
hurrah, 
And a 
read mUle failthe well give them every day, 
Oh, how happy will we live, boys, with our Colleens by our side, 
Our country free, and we agree, and peaceful in our pride.

J. H . 
RYAN'S 
VERSION or " 
WHY CAN'T PADDY BE A GENTLEMAN." 
Written and Sung with great success by J.11 RYAN. 
As through the city at night I 
go, 
And see all nations' clan ; 
Welsh, Dutch, and Scotch, and German, 
All declate they're gentlemen. 
As this is `• a 
free country. 
And each man has a show; 
Then why can't Paddy be a 
gentleman, 
That's what I 
want to know." 
CHORUS. 
Then why can't Paddy be a 
gentleman. 
A gentleman, a 
gentleman ; 
Then why can't Paddy be a 
gent:eman, 
That's what I 
want to know. 
Saint Patrick was a 
gentleman, 
From him we take our name ; 
There is no Nation on this earth, 
Can boast of one the same. 
Read the history of this late war, 
And in that same you'll find ; 
Great deeds of Irish gentlemen, 
General McClennan was one, do you mind. 
Spoken.—I 
will recite a 
few lines just while I 
have time, 
and hope they will gain approbation. 
It's concerning the 
style of the Emerald Isle, the dress and costume of that 
Nation. There has been a 
debate I 
can tell you of late, 
I've been charged with misrepresentation; for the clothes 
I 
now wear, some people declare, it's not the costume of 
our Nation. 
But should you think I 
jest of how an Irish-
man dressed. 
Take a 
trip there and pass observation, and 
the truth you can tell, why they dress just as well as the 
folks in the whole British Nation. 
Then why can't Paddy, (ke. 
STow I'll commence with my hat, its the head-piece of Pat, 
Why we wear them the truth you can credit; 
Whether they're old-fashioned or new, there is one thing 
that's true, 
You'll never meet Paddy hare- headed. 
Whether broad-brim in make, or narrow in shape, 
Or as square as a 
three- cornered cupboard ; 
Let him roam for or near, there is one thing that's clear, 
An Irishman's head is always covere . 
Then why can't Paddy, (tc.

- 
Next comes my old coat, not worth more than a 
groat, 
But it's made of good frieze, warm and lasting; 
For no broad glossy black, will I 
put on my back, 
And wear while my stomach is fasting. 
For a 
good coat of grey, 1 would much rather pay, 
And my conscience keep clear of a 
score; 
Than tailors be dunning, and after me running, 
For weating a 
coat I 
ne'er paid for. 
Then why can't Paddy, &c. 
Then more power to the stitches, in my corduroy breeches, 
in my grandfather's days, they were the fashion ; 
For an Earl or a 
Squire in those days could be seen in knee. 
breeches, 
And faith they looked. flashing. 
It was the fops of Broadway, stole our costume away; 
But sure it come by good chance, 
Just to hide their bad legs, that looked like crooked pegs, 
They invented those things they call pants. 
Then why can't Paddy,&-c. 
Should you go any day through the city of Dublin so gay, 
You'll find gents in broadcloth and gold chains, too ; 
Likewise our blue-eyed girls, with their hair hung in curls, 
We could match any nation you name, too. 
But like this great land, sure, we have both rich and poor, 
And in all New York population; 
Under coats well patched, perhaps. there's well thatched 
The best hearts in the whole Yankee Nation. 
Then why can't Paddy, &c. 
I've noticed on the stage, that here seems the rage, 
To introduce whisky and fighting; 
They rant and they roar, with a 
big stick smash the floor, 
An Irishman's character they're slighting. 
They don't care a 
pin, provided they get a 
cheer and a 
grin, 
For an Irishman's feelings is not craven ; 
But when I 
can't make a 
smile, without disgracing my 
own native Emerald Isle, 
Then J. 
H. 
RYAN is no true son of Erin.

THE WAKE OF TEDDY ROE. 
In dear Limerick, that city of riches and fame, 
A brogue-maker died, Teddy Roe was his name ; 
The neighbors all grieved, rich and poor, high and low, 
And to wake with poor Teddy they resolved for to go. 
,("poken.—Misther Dougherty, the Tipperary coachman, 
was sent for immediately. " Now, you see. Dougherty, 
we want you to drive us chine and dacently to Teddy 
Roe's wake. 
By the powers ! he has taken it into his head 
to die, so he would not be very well pleased if we neglect-
ed to call on him." 
Blood and turf l 
had you seen how 
Dougherty skipped over the hog, for all the world like a 
drum-major of leprechauns, to get a 
coach for the ladies; 
then he borrowed Katty 0"foole's new turf-kish, and 
stuffed the bottom well with green rushes, taking care to 
turn down the stumps, lest the long ones should disturb 
the ladies' feelings. 
Then he showed his dexterity in 
banding in 
Miss Delany, Mrs. Blaney, Mister Fegan, and Miss Doe, 
Who all went in the coach to the wake of Teddy Roe. 
All bedisened so fine, in their best Sunday clothes, 
Miss Doe's squint eye, and Mr. Fegan's red nose ; 
At poor Ted's they arrived, where they'd oft been before, 
And Dougherty gave a 
loud thump at the door. 
Spoken.—" Arrah ! Judy, Judy 
cries Phelim 311'Shane, 
Teddy's uncle, " open the door, here's all the quality ar-
rived; but run first and stick poor Ted on the but- end of 
his bottom against the wall ; put on his best wig and a 
chine shirt, and stick his pipe in his cheek, that lie may 
look nate and decent before them ; I'll open the door my-
self." 
So out hobbles Pliehiin. " Arrah 1 
is it yourselves 
that's come to wake with poor Ted ? he is up in the cock-
loft, taking a 
parting dlirop of Inalshowen together wid a 
few friends, so be after walking up time ladder if you phase ; 
that's right, walk up, ladies, tea will soon be ready." 
" 
What have you got for tea ?" 
Herrings and paratees.•' 
" 
Och, bloody murther, d•ye think, you spalpeen, that will 
satisfy the beautiful, 
Miss Delany, & c. 
[II 
THE WAKE OF, &C.—[CONCLUDED. 
Now the whisky went round, till they could not agree, 
Who were highest of rank, or of best pedigree ; 
And front words they fell to blows, just like Donnybrook 
And among them poor Ted lie came in for his share. 
Spoken.—"Hubbaboo! hubbaboo! what the divil are 
you about ? what are you doing ?" By the shillelah of 
Barney Dliti I 
if they havn't got poor Ted down among 
them.--och, they'll smother the poor crature; get off him 
get off him. 
Judy take hold of his leg, and help me to 
drag him from under the lump." 
Och, blood and oons ! 
see them now ! they've given the corpse a 
black eye ; sure 
and I 
expected better behavior from — Miss Delany," (to 
Returning, a 
coachful of whisky and gill, 
At home they arrived, and at length staggered in ; 
Such figures of fun, ' twill be said for their sake, 
Sure never before were seen at a 
wake. 
Spoken. —" Bless us! Dougherty, what black drunken 
devils are those you are bringing home ! where did you 
pick 'em up, my jewel ?" Och, don't bother me, in 
honey, 
and you'll get the whole account as clear as mud ; but, 
Judy, we must first wash and put to bed, the beautiful and 
accomplished 
Miss Delany, Mrs. Blaney, Mr. Fegan, and Miss Doe. 
Who all went in a 
coach to the wake of Teddy Roe. 
THE FOUNDLING, OR NO FATHER'S CARE. 
No father's care, that I'm aware, 
Hove L 
been cherisli'd by ; 
No mother's smite, did e'er beguile, 
My 
joyless infancy. 
That [' in alive, and grow, and thrive, 
I 
know, indeed, full well ; 
But how, alas ! it came to pass, 
I 
cannot, cannot tell? 
No father's care, &e. 
No father's pinch might make me flinch, 
As you're no doubt aware; 
A mother's tweak upon the cheek, 
Is very hard to bear. 
But harder yet, to owe a 
debt 
To no progenitor ; 
Oh, I 
would die— content if I 
Could be accounted ton 
No father's care, dm,

NORAH MAL0/. 
AIR:— " 
Wishing Gate." 
One fine summer's day, in the night rather late, 
Paddy Flinn had sneaked off to the old wishing gate, 
To just try his hand at a 
sort of a 
spell, 
About things that his auld mother used for to tell ; 
That fairies and conjurers squatted down there, 
To give phat folks ax'd at that time of the year. 
So Paddy went there just his luck for to try, 
And he wished for a 
pig to put into his sty ; 
But wait awhile yet as the truth I 
relate, 
Phat happened to Pat at the wishing gate. 
(Spoken)—Och! sure, Paddy was a 
good boy enough, if he 
had not been such a 
bad one ; and, sure, mighty fond of 
me he was. 
Och ! sure he fell in love wid me before he 
saw me. 
Och! faith, that's true for me, so it is ; for he 
was after telling me widout speaking a 
word of mouth— 
but, ()eh! faith it was by word of eye he was after telling 
me. He was born at Kilkenny; but sure he was such a 
roving blade, that he run away from home before he could 
walk. 
But wait awhile ago till I'se tell yez how the wish-
ing gate was after sarving him. 
" 
I 
wish for," says Pat, as the gate he did stride, 
" 
As I've got but one pig, just another beside; 
And I 
wish for some praities, the pigs for to fade; 
And I 
wish they might brade, and knock up a 
good trade, 
I'd then buy some poultry, ducks and a 
cow, 
[
1] 
13 
NORAH MALOY—[CONcLuDED. 
And a 
thumping shillelah,to kick up a 
row; 
And then I 
cud get me a 
handsome young bride, 
And bogtrotting Katty (Spoken—That's me) I'd then push 
aside." 
But little did Pat know he was overheard, 
But, faith, I 
was there, and sucked in every word. 
(Spoken)—Och! bad luck to yez, Paddy, says I, you 
desaver; but not a 
word did I 
spake. 
Sure is this the way 
you are true-hearted by your falsehood ? 
And every word 
of truth you told me was a 
lie. 
Well, I 
kept on talking 
widout saying a 
word. 
So away went Paddy on first and 
I 
before him, crying fit to break the heart of me widout 
shedding a 
tear. 
So up he goes to the pig-sty to see had 
he got the other pig. 
Och! by the faith of me, the only 
pig he had left was gone, and had run away wid the pratie 
garden in his pocket. 
Arrah, Paddy, says I, phat's this you 
have been after wishing? Where are the pigs you arn't 
got? Where's the poney that's not born too? Where's 
your poultry and ducks ? 
Faith you are after looking like 
a 
goose! 
Where's the cow you was after axing the wish-
ing gate for? 
Sure and that cow's a 
bull! 
And faith and 
troth, where is myself, the bogtrotter, that you will dis-
charge before you have me; and where's the shillelah, the 
shillehth that you are going to kick up a 
row wid? 
Arrah, 
faith and sure, here's that same un, cried Jerry Donovan; 
and faith, Paddy, I'll be after giving you phat you have 
been axing for—so I 
will. 
So Jerry hit on to Pat, and Pat 
fell to tearing all the bald hair off his head—for the fairy 
had made an old man of him, though be was only twenty. 
He got blind of both legs, lame of both eyes, his elbows 
down at heels, and his heels out at elbows; so I 
hope 
it will he a 
warning to all greedy folks, and teach us to be 
contented wid what we have, whether we have got it or 
not.

THE LITTLE COLLEEN.—[CoNcLuDED.] 
My father had gone to his work on the farm, 
My mother was minding the dairy, 
To go to the fair I 
thought it no harm, 
So tripped it as light as a 
fairy; 
The lads and the lasses were dancing with glee, 
Miss Macarty was out with big Harry ; 
I 
looked all around, but no where could I 
see 
My swateheart, my own darling Larry. 
Cho.—Then success, &c. 
Then the piper struck up wid a 
beautiful tune, 
06, the music he play'd was delightful; 
If Larry don't come I'll go mad very soon, 
For indade I 
was getting quite spiteful; 
They kissed in the ring, the buckle they crost, 
My feet I 
could scarcely keep quiet, 
I 
wanted a 
jig, but my partner I'd lost, 
-When I 
get him I'll kick up a 
riot. 
Mo.—Then success, &c. 
Mister Larry in the midst of the fair I 
did spy, 
He was dancing a 
lilt so delicious 
With Mistress Kate Kearney; to myself then thinks 
This conduct is rather suspicious ; 
To trate me so lightly, you'll say 'twas a 
shame, 
When admirers I 
know I 
have plenty, 
To put up with such conduct I'd be much to blame, 
Where he's one swateheart, I 
can get twinty. 
Cho.—Then suecess, ctc. 
If a 
nate Irish boy in the company here 
Will propose then, no longer I'll tarry; 
If he's English I 
don't mind, bekase I've a 
fear 
I'm getting too ould now to marry; 
If he's Scotch I 
don't mind, for I 
now feel inclined 
For his conduct to make Larry whistle; 
If we wed, our affections they shall be entwined 
Like the Shamrock, the Rose, and the Thistle. 
Cho.—Then success, & c.

TIIE CONDUCTOR. 
Composed and sung by J. H. RYAN. 
PH try and tell you in this song. 
What makes me so unnerved, 
And I 
will ask you, every one, 
it you think it's been deserved. 
By a 
girl I 
loved, by the name of Mary Ann, 
I 
have had her near and far, 
But she left me for a 
conductor, 
On a 
Fulton Avenue ear. 
CHORUS. 
While ding dong the bells they went. 
The bells they went, the bells they went, 
Oh, didn't he think himself a 
gent, 
When he walked through the middle of the car 
For six months we were sparking, 
But forget I 
never can, 
The last day I 
went sparking, 
With lovely Mary Ann. 
We went to see the Russian prince, 
But the walk being rather far, 
I 
asked her it she would not ride, 
On a 
railway car; 
That I 
might chatter love inside, 
To lovely Mary Ann. 
While ding dong, &c. 
When the day's fun it was through, 
My heart being light and merry. 
I 
thought the next thing I 
would do, 
Was to see her o'er the ferry. 
But when I 
got the other side, 
My happiness there did mar, 
For she shook me for the conductor, 
On the Fulton Avenue car. 
While ding dong,:ifrc. 
She called him love ; he answered dove, 
While I 
gazed on them both, 
And troubled was in my own mind, 
I 
there swore many an oath. 
That if ever I 
should get a 
chance, 
Let it be near or far, 
I 
will learn him a 
broadback dance, 
While I 
throw him from his car. 
While ding dong, &c. 
TRUE SONS OF ERIN. 
Written and Sung with immense applause by J. 
H. 
RTAN. 
Each day poor Erin, thousands leave you, 
And sure what can you do alone I 
But no wonder some du deceive you, 
And drive your true sons far from home, 
When I 
read of our girls once so gayly, 
As over history's pages that I 
glance ; 
And when Pat would twist his big shillelah. 
How he'd bring his colleen through the dance. 
CHORUS. 
Join in the sport, ah! ah! 
Pretty girls to court, ah! ah ! 
Make one thing sure, altbo' we're poor, 
Where 'ere we go let us be true; 
Faugh a 
ballagh—clear the way ! 
I'm the boy both night and day, 
I'll still stick up for Gramachree; 
We're yet true sons of Erin. 
Hark! hark! I 
hear the trumpet sounding, 
I 
hear its free blast loud and shrill ; 
And though the enemy are prowling, 
Our men will gather on the hill. 
Farewell, sister, and little brother, 
Tho' I 
may n,'er see thee again ; 
I'm bound to fight for Ireland, mother, 
And help to break her long-linked chain. 
March with the men, ah! ah ! 
Freedom shouts aloud, ah ! alt ! 
Mahe one thing sure altho' we're poor, 
Where ' ere we go, let us be true. 
Faugh a 
ballagh—clear the war ! 
I'm the boy both night and day, 
I'll still stick up for Gramachree, 
We're yet true sons of Erin. 
Freedom is not dead, it's only sleeping, 
And we're told will soon awake; 
So poor old Erin don't be weeping, 
Though your sons a 
foreign shore may seek; 
For the many true sons you're after rearing, 
Soon will return with a 
smile 
To avenge the troubles you are bearing, 
And give freedom to our Shamrock Isle. 
March with the crowd, ah ! ab! 
Freedom shouts aloud, ah I 
ah ! 
Make one thing sure, altho' we're poor, 
Whey ' ere we go. let us be true, 
Faugh a 
ballagh—clear the way, 
Put told ' tis in America, 
I'd find the boys both night and day, 
Preparing for old Erin.

ROD? MULLIGAN. 
Written and sung with immense success by J. H. RYAN. 
Have you heard of Body Mulligan, the Dully girls' joy ? 
Well, if you want to know him, bedad, here stands I 
be 
boy. 
There's not a 
girl in Dublin fair, but by me is well known, 
And wont they seem to like me, for I 
kiss'd the Blarney 
stone. 
Spoken — Yes, for begar I'm the divil among the girls, 
as Mieky Flynn said when he bate the divil himself in love 
matters. 
CHORUS. 
But who's for Donnybrook. I 
cry, to view the fun and 
fair, 
Jump up on my jaunting car, and 111 quickly drive you 
there. 
Now if you're on for sport sure I'm the sort I'll show you 
lot of tun, 
I'll sit on my yoke and crack a 
joke with any body under 
the sun. 
And I 
know well enough where they sell good stuff, and 
the man behind the bar. 
Can tell by my wink what kind of drink will grease the 
wheels of my jaunting ear. 
Spoken. — Begoora he can that, from the crame of the 
valley to what we call the real ould " ding dong." 
But who's, &c. 
Then fill your glasses full, ray boys, 
me, 
here's success to poor mild Ireland, 
And ere I 
do depart this life r 
hope 
My own, my dear and native land a

toast with 
the emerald of the sea, 
so live to see, 
land of liberty • 
So who's for Donnybrook 1

J 
unip up on my jaunting car and Pin the boy can drive 
you there.

THE GREEN ISLE OF THE SEA. 
Written and Sung by J. H. RYAN. 
I am the son of an Irishman, 
In Dublin I 
was born; 
Where often you meet with a 
welcome hand, 
And you're seldom met with scorn. 
l'm not ashamed to say 
It's the land of my birth ; 
Tho' it has got numerous foes, 
But I 
hope that freedom yet will shine 
Where that green little shamrock grows. 
CHORUS. 
Then there's not a 
spot, hurrah, my boys! 
Like that Green Isle of the sea ; 
Where the blooming little Shamrock grows, 
Arrah, that's the land for me. 
I 
look on its mountains and its hills; 
Its lakes and valleys so grand; 
And read of the boys of '98, 
How they fought for Paddy's land. 
And our blue-eyed girls, with their hair in curls, 
But few of them now are seen; 
Because they were forced to emigrate 
From the Land of the Shamrock Green. 
Then there's not, &c. 
Think of the days of the great Brian Boru, 
Sarsfield, Fitzgerald, and Wolfe Tone; 
And let their spirits still remain, 
Although they're dead and gone. 
There's Emmett, and Owen Rowe and O'Connell, too, 
Who ne'er fear'd to demand; 
Amidst our British Saxon foes, 
The rights of Paddy's Land. 
Then we'll hip hurrah, for Erin go Bragh, 
And one another befriend; 
An I 
hope the day is drawing nigh, 
Old Ireland to defend.

THE WIDOW DIACHREE. 
AIR:—" Jim the Carter Lad." 
_Written exprAssly for the " character of Rody the Rover," in an epi-
sode of the same name, and sung by J. H. RYAN with unbounded ap-
plause. 
I 
fell in love with this charming woman, her name is 
Widow Machree, 
She came all the way from America, ould Ireland for to 
see, 
To see us both together % would fill your hearts with joy, 
The Widow Machree from Americy. with the Roving 
Irish Boy. 
CHORUS. 
Crack, crack, goes my whip, while on my car 1 
ride, 
Arrah I 
the sorra one can bate me while the widow's by 
my side; 
To see us both together ' twould fill your hearts with joy, 
The Widow Machree from Americy and the Roving Irish 
Boy. 
Oh, the first time that I 
met her, sure I 
never can forget, 
It was up at Holmes's, the day being cold and wet; 
But as we rode out together, the people cheered with joy, 
To see the Widow Machree from Americy, with 
the 
Roving Irish Boy, 
Crack, crack, (Ix. 
The next day I 
call'd to see her, and vow'd we ne'ershould 
part, 
She swore upon that very day, 1 
stole away her heart; 
And it we're to be married, ' twill fill my heart with joy, 
To have the Widow Machree from Americy, with the 
Roving Irish Boy. 
Crack, crack, &c. 
OUR IRISH LASSIES. 
Taken from GERALD GRIFFIN'S Works and Sung hy 
IL RYAN. 
Here's to our Irish lassies, 
Where so 'ere their home; 
'Mid the ancient cities, 
Or where wild streams foam. 
For never hearts more constant, 
Nor eyes more bright; 
As such we pledge them fondly, 
On this festive night 
CHORUS. 
Here's to our Irish lassies, 
With their smiles divine; 
With drinking sparkling glasses. 
Of the rose red wine. 
Here's to all our lovely maidens, 
With their smiles divine ; 
We drink in sparkling glasses, 
Of the rose red wine. 
All our lovely maidens, 
That charmed our sires of yore; 
Live and shine immortal, 
In wild Hardie lore. 
Still the same sweet faces, 
And their forms so fair; 
Blooms from Antrim's pillars, 
To the bright Kenmore. 
Here's to our, & c. 
It is true I've been a 
wanderer, 
O'er England's broad plains; 
Through and through I've wandered, 
Scotland's wild domains. 
And here I 
have seen maidens, 
In the light of youth ; 
But not that Irish fondness; 
Nor that Irish truth. 
Denmark's maids are lovely, 
With their locks of gold; 
Spanish maids are stately. 
France hath charms untold. 
But that sweet bright beauty, 
Filling glance and smile; 
Dwells but with the maidens, 
Of the Emerald Isle. 
Here's to our, &O. 
Here's to our. & c. 
May they live forever, 
As in olden time: 
When brave warriors woo'd them, 
And sweet bards sublime. 
May their lovely. faces, 
Shine for aye the same; 
With that love-light beauty, 
Of love's radiant flame. 
Here's to our, & e.

IRELAND A HUNDRED YEARS AGO. 
Written and Sung by J. H. RYAN. 
When I 
think on dear old Ireland, 
The bright gem of the west, 
When I 
think on dear old Ireland, 
The land St. Patrick blessed. 
With love for dear old Ireland, 
My heart does overflow, 
When I 
read about her happy days, 
A hundred years ago. 
Those bright and happy days are gone, 
A cloud seems o'er them east, 
Those bright and happy days are gone, 
Those good days of the past. 
Loud and foul oppression, 
So many have laid low, 
Who would have wished to seen those days, 
A hundred years ago. 
No more the good old mail coach stops, 
To get rid of its load, 
No more the whip is heard to crack, 
Along our country road. 
The poor old mail coach is smashed up, 
It travelled rather slow, 
Ali, but it travelled fast enough for us, 
A hundred years ago. 
But now farewell, I'll bid adieu, 
To Erin's lovely shore, 
I'll bid adieu to that green sod, 
r11101111 I 
may never see it more. 
It's to this far and distant : and, 
I 
was obliged to go, 
When I 
hope 
see such days as were 
A hundred years ago.

MY OWN LAND. 
Written and sung by J. H. RYAN. 
This world has many a 
glorious land, 
Where beauty ever dwells, 
With snow- crowned hills and rivers grand, 
And happy summer dells. 
Of which the poet in his lays, 
Lives ever more to tell, 
Where heroes died in former days, 
And freedom's martyrs fell. 
CHORUS. 
My own land, I 
love her still, 
Wherever I 
may be, 
My own land, poor Ireland, 
My heart beats still for thee. 
The songs of which the poet sings, 
That with all time shall live, 
To tell in solemn scenes the woes, 
It is not mine to give, 
131a, a 
purer heart will never beat, 
For love of thee and thine, 
I'll leave this offering yet at thy feet, 
Oh native land of mine. 
My own land, tite. 
The only loss a 
mother feels, 
Is when bending over her child, 
Or lovers when they lonely kneel, 
To whisper love-thoughts wild. 
Or maidens when the first pure kiss 
Of love is on their brow, 
Are weak ; yes, cold and passionless, 
To the love within me now. 
My own land, tte

But tell him on some other night, 
He will find his Molly here.

THE NEW YORK FIRE BRIGADE. 
A new Song Written, Composed and Sung, with great success, by 
J. 
II. 
RYAN. 
As I 
wander through the City at times, 
In search of something new ; 
According as it runs in rhymes, 
I'll name it unto you. 
From a 
clerk up to a 
tailor, 
Or ally 0- her trade; 
I 
must declare, none can compare, 
With the New York Fire Brigade. 
CHORUS. 
Then drive away, my hearties, 
Of nothing be afraid; 
For the Cops they are thrown in the dark, 
By the New York Fire Brigade. 
Nosy when the alarm bell rings out, 
What more can you desire ; 
Now to see the way they puff and pout, 
Wbon going to a 
fire. 
They strike out right, with all their might, 
A 
nd of nothing seem afraid ; 
While the Cops they have to clear the way, 
For the New York Fire Brigade. 
Then drive away, &c. 
To see them up in Tompkins' Park, 
The day the Prince was there ; 
They did their work up to the mark, 
which made his Highness stare. 
For nothing could be better done, 
Than the way they did parade ; 
For the Cops declare they'll put on airs, 
With tile Brooklyn Fire Brigade. 
Then drive away, &c, 
I'll try and tell you in this song. 
\\• hat once occurred to me; 
Returning home on one fine night, 
After being on a 
jamberee. 
My home being in a 
blaze, 
Without my wife I 
was afraid ; 
For I 
found ere long that she had gone 
With one of the Fire Brigade. 
Then drive away, &c. 
And some time after that, 
A 
tine baby-boy she had; 
Very strange to say. 
It looks no ways like his dad. 
But the people as it waddles out, 
They're very much afraid; 
That it has got the nose and mouth, 
Of one of the Fire Brigade. 
Then drive away, &c.

THE LAND OF UNCLE SAX 
Air ;--" The Comet of the West." 
Composed and sung by J. H. RYAN. 
Pat Ryan is my name, 
From old Ireland I 
just came, 
And to my friends I 
bid adieu, 
I've left old Erin's Isle, 
But it's only for a 
while, 
But where ere I 
go, to her my heart is true. 
CHORUS. 
Shout, boys, shout, and let's be merry, 
Hurrah for the land of Uncle Sam, 
May that banner always wave 
To cheer the free and brave and happy here be every 
Irishman. 
1 
to the colleen bid good-bye, 
As the big tear filled her eye, 
When she heard I 
was going to cross the sea; 
But I 
promised I'd go back, 
With my. bundle on my back, 
And it's married to the darling won't I 
be. 
Shout, boys, shout, &c. 
I 
have left far behind, 
The friends to me were kind; 
But I 
hope again them I 
will see, 
When with comrades by my side, 
I'll return with the tide, 
And strike for poor Erin's liberty. 
Shout, boys shout, &c. 
I'd a 
letter from abroad, 
In which it states a 
word, 
That here it was glorious to be seen, 
how every Irishman could unite. 
With heart and hand, 
And do honor to our little Isle so green. 
Shout, boys, shout, &c.

ROLLICKING BODY. 
Written and Sung with great applause by J. H. 
RYAN. 
Some say that in Limerick I 
first saw day-light, 
While others in Dublin would have my first night, 
But as writers on genius are often astray, 
I 
think for myself I've got something to say. 
For the morn I 
was born I 
very well know, 
When the Clergyman tumbled in covered with snow, 
He got hold of my hand and my heart jumped with joy, 
As he christened me Body, a 
true Irish boy. 
CHORUS. 
Then hurrah for ould Erin, the land of my birth, 
That's the place to see pleasure, diversion and mirth, 
And the bright blooming girls, I 
make them all stare, 
When rollicking Body's at Donnybrook Fair. 
Arrah ! in weddin's and christ'nin's that beatenly bliss, 
To stand by the bride and to take the first kiss, 
While the craythur looked shy as if nothing occurred, 
And her husband looks daggers, but he darn% say a 
word. 
Ochone for the carvin' of potatoes and pigs, 
While the piper he plays up some real Irish jigs, 
And the bright blooming girls, their hearts jump with joy, 
To dance with young Body a 
true Irish boy. 
Then hurrah, &c. 
Arrah, talking of fun, I 
don't wish to offend, 
For I've always the heart for to stand by a 
friend, 
in love, Inn or fight, I'm the boy that is there, 
I'm the pride of the parish at Donnybrook Fair. 
Though Some paint poor Pat with a 
villainous face, 
Yet I 
hope none of that in my own you can trace, 
For to see you all happy, it fills me with joy, 
For I'm rollicking Body a 
true Irish boy. 
Then hurrah, &c.

SARAH GILL. 
Ant:—" Jessie at the Railway Bar." 
Composed by J. 11. RYAN, and Sung by RYAN and Blum 
As a 
native of the city, my woes you'll surely pity, 
When you have heard the truth of what I've got to say ; 
To me it's been degrading, the treatment of a 
maiden, 
Who, with some other swell, she has gone and run away. 
Her I 
used to meet on her walk down Chatham Street, 
She often said she lov'd me, though of lovers she had five; 
Such a 
grand take in I 
never get again, 
No, I 
swore by me carrots the longest day I'm alive. 
Spoken — Yes, gentlemen, I'd have you all to know that her ad. 
mirers were— 
Cuonus.—A slater and a 
nailer, and a 
dashing young gold beater. 
That used to run to meet her, their appointment to fill ; 
Also a 
furnace stoker, and a 
stunning old pawn-broker, 
Was trying to win the heart of my charming Sarah Gill. 
The theatre I 
had shown her the meaning of some parts. 
I 
told her she took it well, I 
thought that I 
was all serene ; 
'Till at length I 
discovered she had five other lovers, 
Then I 
might consider that I 
was played out clean. 
But when at night we'd walk, she would so softly talk, 
It made rue imagine some love was remaining still; 
'Till at length her I 
did see, and she out upon the spree, 
Then I 
cried, " Oh, false oh, false, is my charming Sarah Gill." 
Spoken.—But as I 
said before— 
A slater and a 
nailer, & c. 
One night I 
rushed to meet her, on her appearance did greet her, 
On that occasion she- did dress just like a 
fairy Queen ; 
With beer now I've been lushing, and she a 
kind of pushing, 
She asked me to escort her to her grand domain. 
When sometime there, I 
spent all my stamps, they quickly went, 
I 
lay on the sofa to take a 
doze, till I 
was cold and chill; 
I 
awoke just like a 
stone, my watch and coat was gone, 
But nowhere to be found was my charming Sarah Gill. 
Spoken.—And as I 
went into the stxeet, I 
was surrounded by a 
lot of Boot-blacks, who first gave me a grand hurrah. 
Then one 
of the crowd, about two inches high, remarked : " Say, Johnny, 
you needn't be surprised or astonished, you are not the only one 
that has gone in there with a 
coat, and come out coatless; but stiil 
she .had five others and they were-.-
A slater and a 
nailer, & c, 
SW EET LAVINA. 
Composed and sung by J. IE. RYAN. 
Kind friends, listen to my song, 
I 
know my woes you'll pity, 
It's of a 
blonde who did abscond, 
With a 
young man in the city. 
Now every night, with great delight, 
I 
went to meet Lavina, 
But, alas, she has gone with this other young man, 
That played on the Concertina. 
CHORUS. 
Tier hair was fair, I 
do declare, 
Her name it was Lavina, 
She was fond of the boys, 
With their musical toys, 
That played on the Concertina. 
The first time that I 
met my love, 
I 
don't mind telling you, 
It was at a 
party which was held, 
On Sixth Avenue, between 69th and 40th streets. 
When I 
danced with Lavina, 
But I 
didn't think then, 
She had another young man, 
That played on the Concertina. 
She. took my arm, without alarm, 
I 
escorted her to her dwelling, 
And on the way, with heart so gay, 
Such loving tales were telling. 
Her winning smile, did me beguile, 
Each time that I had seen her, 
But I 
found out at length, 
All the love she meant, 
With this fellow with the Concertina. 
Her hair, &c. 
Her hair, &e. 
I 
determined for to watch the game, 
One night as she went mulching, 
So quite concealed I 
did remain, 
Till both entered into the kitchen, 
With indignation wild my blood it boiled, 
I 
was bound to put between them, 
So in I 
ran, knocked down the man, 
And smashed his Concertina. 
Her hair, &c.

WHEN THIS BATTLE'S OVER. 
Composed and sung by J. 
H. 
RYAN. 
When this battle's over and the sounds of the fight, 
Have closed with the closing day, 
How warmly round our old fire's light, 
We'll merrilly pass our time away. 
Talking of the days when we were boys, 
And hope of days to come, 
Yes time may bring us better joys, 
And comfort to the Irish peasant's borne. 
CHORUS. 
Then won't we merrilly sing, 
And each be as happy as a 
king; 
Yes, all in union they should be, 
With health, strength and liberty. 
Fur. many an eye will gleam with joy, 
That has often shed a 
tear, 
And many a 
stalwart Irish boy, 
Will then be free from fear. 
When our brave men like some mighty rock, 
Amidst the foaming sea, 
Will stand against the battle shock, 
For home and liberty. 
Then won't we, ike. 
And those who knew each other not, 
Their hands together steal, 
Each thinks upon that lovely spot, 
And all like brothers feel, 
Yes such thoughts were always given, 
Though we've often had to part, 
The love of home, like love of heaven, 
Is woven in each true Irish heart. 
Then won't we, &e.

TEE DILAPIDATED POLICEMAN. 
Composed and sung by J. 
H. 
RYAN. 
Kind friend, listen to my song ; 
I'm sure my woes you'll pity ; 
Its of a 
girl that I 
kenw well 
She lived in New York city, 
Near East Broadway every night about half-past eight, 
When I 
was on my duty, 
1 
down the basement steps would creep, 
To court my kitchen beauty. 
CHORUS. 
But my heart grows in a 
twirl, 
When I 
think on Ketty Tyrrell ; 
That to her coney she has proved untrue; 
My hair is turning gray, 
For it was on a 
summer's day, 
She ran off with a 
sailor, 
And his fat lol de docile do. 
.1 met them walking out one day, 
While she was going to market, 
Arm-in-arm they walked along, 
And through the streets did spark it. 
Right opposite a 
lager- bier saloon they stopped, 
He asked her in to treat her, 
While I 
against a 
lamp-post was propped, 
And gazing on them like an alligator. 
Spoken.— Yes, Ladies and Gentlemen, its an old saying 
and a 
true one, that the course of true love never runs 
smooth, from the fact that here am I, a 
dilapidated police-
man, who has been thrown upon the sandy deserts of my 
own responsibility, and all through loving a 
lump of kitch-
en suet. 
Oh how I 
remember them glorious days gone 
by, when I 
used to go down into that kitchen as full as an 
empty sack, and come up again on my heat not able to 
stir, Pd be so full of hot cakes, cold beef, and warm tea. 
Now I'm left to sing out— 
Farewell to the glorious days gone by. 
The days of ham and mut ton ; 
The policeman in the station house, 
They christened me a 
glutton. 
But my heart, &c, 
LARRY CASEY. 
Written and Sung by J. 
H. 
RYAN, 
Arrah, Larry Casey is my name, 
In Tipperary I 
was born ; 
And though I'm from that place of fame, 
By $ome I 
oft meet scorn. 
I 
had a 
sweet- heart, Kate O'Toole, 
In my arms I 
oft did fold her ; 
But now her heart is wailing low. 
Since her Larry's gone for a 
sodger. 
CHORUS. 
Quick, march, hurrah, and a 
right-about face, 
With my gull upon my shoulder ; 
Arrah, Faugh a 
ballagh,—clear the way, 
I'm a 
Tipperary sodger. 
Now some said I 
was a 
foundlin' boy, 
Who's raised by one or another ; 
Bekays I 
never had the joy 
To see my father or mother. 
But a 
friend of mine— one Sargeant Moore, 
When from a 
boy I 
grew older ; 
Ile said the best thin g I 
could do, 
Would 'list and be a 
soldier. 
Quick, march, &c. 
Now I 
bid farewell to my colleen rue, 
Who fainted in hysterics ; 
And with the rest of my comrades, 
I 
was marched off to the barracks. 
Where they measured me from head to foot, 
And placed a 
gun npon my shoulder ; 
And says they, you'll bless the day, 
You enlisted for a 
soldier. 
Quick, march, &c. 
After being some time in " qnad " for war we were prepared, 
With hearts quite light and airy ; 
For our regiment comprised of Munster men, 
And spunky Tipperary. 
And when placed upon the battle-field, 
In the fight there was none bolder ; 
Arrah, give me the heart of an Irishman, 
lie's my darlint for a 
soldier. 
Quick, march, 64c. 
As war being over. I 
soon return home, 
No longr will I 
tarry ; 
I'll then seek for the girl I 
love, 
And to her I 
will marry. 
And when I 
stand on my shamrock sod, 
And my colleen I 
behold her ; 
It's with her I 
will stop at home. 
Until fighting like a 
Fenian soldier.

IF YOU WANT TO BE A GENTLEMAN. 
NEW MOTTO SONG. 
Oomposed and Sung by J. 
H . 
RYAN, with the greatest success. 
Since I 
gave over drinking rum, 
I've set myself a 
task, 
And now kind friends before you here, 
A fair question might I 
ask. 
First to begin has not rum and gin, 
Been the ruination of mankind. 
In my song I 
prove bethre I 
move 
The truth I 
speak you'll find. 
CHORUS . 
Then if you want to be a 
Gentleman, 
A Gentleman, A Gentleman, 
Lose no time but be a 
member then: 
In this glorious temperance cause. 
I've been in all kinds of society, 
Since here 'I 
did arrive, 
But I 
find by sobriety, 
Its the only way to thrive. 
While free from gin and beer, your head is clear, 
None can your feelings' hurt, 
Nor in this race of life, in spite of strife, 
Outdo you by a 
spurt. 
Then if you want, &c. 
Now I 
could many facts re—call 
And prove them unto you, 
How did Ireland meet with her downfall, 
There is one fact is true, 
Read the history of Oak] Ireland. 
And you'll find my words the same 
In ' DS our boys were beat. 
All I 
but whiskey was to blame. 
Then if you want, &e. 
There's another fact you'll find correct, 
And prove it every day, 
The best of words have no effect, 
If you have no stamps to pay. 
You may have many friends in town, 
Whom would kindness towards you seem, 
But when it comes your broken down, 
Your friends cannot be seen. 
Then if you want, &c.

SAINT PATRICK'S DAY. 
Composed and Sung with great applause by J. H. 
RYAN. The 
Original Dublin Boy. 
I'm well known as the Dublin Boy, 
And as I 
pass along, 
It fills my heart with untold joy, 
To write on Ireland's rights and wrongs. 
For while I 
view that glorious scene, 
It makes my heart feel gay, 
To see them rally around the green, 
Upon St. Patrick's Day. 
ORAL'S. 
For it's down through the Bowery, our banners we display. 
Round by the City Hall, and up along Broadway, 
We don't care weo's our foe, we'll make a 
gallant show, 
Gory of old Ireland on St. Patrick's Day. 
Join hand and hand in brotherhood, 
For liberty and right, 
Our fathers fought through streams of blood, 
Against the Saxon fraud and might. 
So help them then with heart and will, 
in every manly fray, 
And keep the green flag flying still, 
On St. Patrick's Day. 
For it's down, &o. 
Then cheer up old land, bow not your head, 
In sorrow, shame or fear, 
We'll yet avenge our patriots dead. 
And dry our orphan's tear. 
The star of hope still brightly shines, 
To guide us on our way, 
To free our own dear native land. 
On some St. Patrick's Day. 
For it's down "&c. 
There is not a 
spot on all the earth, 
No matter where we trod, 
That we can find the joy and mirth, 
Of our own dear shamrock's sod. 
Though among strangers here we wander, 
From old Ireland far away, 
To what bright hopes our minds do ponder, 
Upon St. Patrick's Day. 
For it's down, &o. 
Oh where's the nation on the earth, 
That reared such sons as granuael, 
An i 
I 
think their names are worthy to be 
Kept in history's tale. 
There's Emmett. and Moore, and O'Connell sure, 
Were they here to-day, 
They would be proud of our glorious turn out, 
Upon St. Patrick's Day. 
For it's down, &o.

It was about the middle of July, 
When we left the Clarence Dock, 
Where all our friends ( lid sob and cry, 
As along the pier they did flock, 
Where mothers did shout with arms stretched out, 
And waver and waver again, 
But we bid good bye and did not sigh. 
As we crossed the stormy main. [ Haul, haul, &c. 
Everything went right enough 
Until sometime out at sea, 
When for want of tobacco to raise a 
puff, 
We were obliged to smoke dry tea. 
And our provisions being all run out, 
It made times very hard, 
So for fraid our teeth would rust and soon fall out, 
We were obliged to eat hog's lard. [ Ilan', haul, Lte. 
We had English. Welsh, and Scotchmen, 
We'd Greeks, Dutch and Poles, 
Together with Jews and Germans, 
Who were greater rogues than fools. 
We had Yankee Sailors, too, on board, 
With a 
mate called the Cockatoo, 
Together with a 
elan of _Irishmen, 
Which composed the whole ship's crew. [ Haul, ac.

KATE O'LEARY. 
Written and Sung by J. H. Rran 
Don't talk to me of your Broadway swells, 
Nor rave about your Bowery belles, 
rn tell you of the best of girls, 
A country little fairy. 
sing to you of a 
girl I 
knew, 
She lived in Huntingdon, it's true : 
And if you listen you'll find there were mighty few 
Could equal Kate O'Leary. 
CHORUS. 
For she is just the girl you'd like to spark ; 
Her eyes are blue and her hair is dark ; 
Not from the Battery to Central Park 
Could you equal Kate O'Leary. 
Her cheeks were red, and her eyes were blue; 
Her hair was dark, of the deepest hue ; 
Her foot was small and neat to view, 
And her heart was liQllt and airy. 
Her voice was music to my ear; 
She had an Irish brogue, so rich and clear: 
The like again I'll never hear 
As from sweet Kate O'Leary. 
For she's just, 8c,c. 
Although she had no" Grecian Bend," 
She had the hearts of all the men. 
For invitations they would send, 
For she danced just like a 
fairy. 
She was none too short, nor yet too tall— 
She had no 
Chignon " nor • Waterfall ;" 
But faith the belle of any ball 
Was my charming Kate O'Leary. 
For she's just, Soc.

FASHIONS OF THE DAY. 
As composed and sung by J. A. GAVIN. 
Oh! with your kind permission, 
A few words to you I'll say, 
I'll relate to you as best I 
earl, 
The Fashions of the day. 
They really are so changeable, 
There's new ones out. each day; 
I'll give them to you and all, 
No matter what you say. 
CHORUS. 
For you must know it is the fashion, 
And you must not say a 
word, 
If you'll not be in the fashion, 
You should leave this festive world. 
We'll be festive, gay, and happy, 
As through life we go, 
But we'll not forget the fashions, 
Not by any means— no, no. 
There's young ladies in their Teens, 
Who did some years ago, 
Wear those great big coal scuttle hats, 
But now alas, not so. 
Since that time they have been cutting 
Little pieces from their hat, 
Until now there's nothing left but 
Something like a 
sprat. 
For you must know, &c. 
Some years ago they wore long trails, 
Two or three yards long, 
With heavy shawls trailing, too, 
And so they would go along. 
[1] 
FASHIONS OF THE DAY.---1 
CONCLUDED. 
But now how short the dresses are, 
With no shawls that to mend, 
And instead of walking as of old, 
They go the Grecian Bend. 
For you must know, &e. 
There's young dashing widows, 
Who used greatly to object 
To comb their hair any way, 
Except down just so in front. 
But now alas—oh I 
what a 
change, 
They don't do that at all, 
They comb it back and in it put 
A ten pound waterfall. 
For you must know, Sze. 
There's young gents of sixteen years, 
Who used to go to school, 
And when let out they would play tag, 
But now, alas, not so. 
Now they go to balls and parties, 
Smoke cigars, play bagatelle, 
Drink Bouborn Sours and Sherry, too, 
And in all shapes cut the swell. 
For you must know, &ie. 
Now, here with my story, 
Oh! now I've nearly done, 
I 
hope that. I 
have pleased you all, 
And have offended none. 
I 
have given all I 
think their dues, 
No jealousies should exist, 
You all you know have your share, 
So I 
will now desist. 
For you must know, &c.

WELLY TOOLE, OF THE COUNTY OF WICK-
LO W. 
Anti—" Did you eplit the pitcher ?" 
Ould Erin has cities for girls that are pretty, 
And well the world knows that is true; sirs ; 
For since Eve was a 
maid in the garden of Eden, 
To our beauties no one dare say " boo," sirs; 
Though with joy I 
appear, I'm beat down with despair-
-My heart is so sore it is making me speak low,— 
And I'll tell you, by gorra! the cause of my sorrow, 
Is Nelly Toole, of the County of Wicklow. 
Spoken.—Yes, Nelly, you are the craythur that is making 
me sup sorrow ; aye, and ate it too ; troth, I'm afraid Ft 1 
be choked with the same feed. 
The first time I 
had the 
pleasure of disearning her was at the wake of Garret 
Byrne ( rest his soul !) as gay a 
boy as ever got a 
head ; and 
Nelly was the real specimen of a 
puny girl. 
The first 
glance I 
got of her I 
was taken on a-wares— as the delph-
man said when the ear drove over his crockery : I'd have 
given any money for a 
seat convaynient to her, but not 
one of the boys could stir, for the beauty of Nelly had 
them frettey ! " Well," says I 
to myself, " l'll have a 
word 
with her if the Devil stood at the door." " I'm here,'' 
says a 
voice in that direction—" Stay there, and bad luck 
to you," says I, for I thought it was Ould Nick that was 
coming to Nick me for what I said. 
But I made a 
bould 
push for the saucer that had the snuff on it, thinking I 
might shove my com"hether by that move ; but I 
vt as called 
on for a 
song, and stir I 
couldn't till I 
begun— 
Oh, Nelly my darling ! 
I'll sing like a 
starling, 
And dance till I 
make the boards sink low,

NELLY TOOLE, OF THE COUNTY OF WIC.A.-
LOW.—[CONCLUDED. 
If you're satisfied, 
To be made a 
bride 
In the beautiful County of Wicklow. 
I 
watched all along how she sneered at my song, 
And my blood with vexation soon rose, sirs ; 
And an odd eye or two in the corner she threw 
To a 
chap they called " Bounce-about Keogh," sirs. 
He was straight, tall, and full, had a 
neck like a 
bull, 
And a 
collar-and- elbow your shins he could tickle; 
In a 
ring at the fair, neither Meath nor Kildare 
Could conquer this divil in Wicklow. 
Spoken.—Av course, when I 
finished my verse, I 
threw an 
oglar into the corner, and there I 
sees my bully bould 
Keogh. Oh 1 
by the contents of the blanket, and that's a 
woolly and lively oath, I 
thought he was the hippotimus 
in comparisetnent to the size of him I " Ah, Corny," says 
I 
to myself, " you will never be giniral over Nelly Toole 
while that fellow is major, but no matter, an offer's as 
good as a 
shove, and she's worth trying for, as Dan said 
of repale." " Hurroo," shouted a dozen youngsters who 
were playing the " priest of the parish," in the corner, 
" 
hive the way there for poor -floppy Hoolaghan," and in 
rowled the fiddler like an apers:e and from the rest oft he 
alphabet. " More power, Hoppy," says wrestling Keogh, 
" 
you're welcome mild stock." " .
Nabocklish," says floppy, 
that means thank ye,— when he seen the wrestler and ould 
Toole discoorsing. " Arrah, Bully Keogh," says lie," if 
you can't get your opportunity to chirrup with the chicken 
don't let the ould cock pass you." 
Keogh called on _floppy 
for a 
song ; he sung a 
rale good one. 
But nothing would 
do but that I 
should sing—

THE WEXFORD MASSACRE.-1649 
They knelt around the cross divine, 
The nation and the maid— 
They boNv'd before redemption's sign, 
And fervently they prayed. 
Three hundred fair and helpless ones, 
Whose crime was this alone— 
Their valiant husbands , sires, and sons 
Had battled for their home. 
Had battled bravely, but in vain— 
The Saxons won the fight ; 
And Irish corses strewed the plain, 
Where Valor slept with Right. 
And now that Man of demon guilt 
To fated Wexford flew 
The red blood reeking on his hilt. 
Of hearts to Erin true 
He found them there— the young and old— 
The maiden and the wife ; 
The guardians brave in death were cold, 
Who dared for them the strife ; 
They prayed for Mercy—God on high 
Before Thy cross they pray'd, 
And ruthless Cromwell bade them die, 
To glut the Saxon blade ! 
Three hundred fell— the stifled prayer 
Was quenched in woman s 
blood, 
Nor youth nor age could move to spare 
From slaughter's crimson flood. 
But nations keep a 
stern account 
Of' deeds that tyrants do ; 
And guiltless blood to heaven will mount 
And Heaven avenge It, too 1 
The flower of the valley was Mary Machree , 
Her smiles, all bewitching, were lovely to see 
The bees round her humming, when summer was gone 
When . he roses were fled, might her lips take for one. 
Her laugh it was music, her breath it was balm, 
Her heart, like the lake, was as pure and as calm, 
Till love o'er it came, like a 
breeze o'er the sea, 
And made the heart heave of sweet Mary Machree. 
She loved—and she wept; for was gladness e'er known 
To dwell in the bosom that Love makes his own ? 
His joys are but momeAs, his griefs are for years; 
He comes all in smiles, but he leaves all in tears 
Her lover was gone to a 
far distant land, 
And Mary, in sa ness, would pace the lone strand, 
And tearfully gaze, on the dark rolling sea, 
That parted her soldier from Mary Machree. 
Oh, pale grew her cheek, when there came from afar, 
The tales of the battle, and tidings of war ; 
IIer eyes filled with tears, when the clouds gather'd dark, 
For fancy would picture some tempest-tost bark ; 
But when winter came on, and the deep woods were bare, 
In the hall vas a 
voice, arc] a 
foot on the stair, 
Oh ! joy to the 
aidcn, for o'er the blue sea, 
The soldier returned to his Mary Machree.

Terry °Tann was a 
nice young man, 
And from a 
boy it was his joy 
To tipple and drink, and lovingly wink 
On the beautiful lasses of Derry. 
And when his love he was making, 
Sure they got in a 
taking, 
One glance from his eye, och, didn't they sigh, 
As if all their backs were breaking, 
He took whisky punch each night for his lunch, 
The thought of his love to bury, 
And then he would roam away from his home, 
To the grief of the lasses of Deny. 
Both day and night, 'twas his delight, 
To follow his game without any shame, 
Till stopped by death, who stopped his breath, 
And killed him wid whisky in Derry. 
The loss to the lasses is grievous, 
From death there is nothing can save us, 
And every sowl in horror did howl, 
°eh, Terry, och, why did you lave us ? 
Their hearts did ache attending his wake, 
And when they his body did bury, 
A crowd was seen, which covered the green, 
Of the black-looking churchyard in Derry. 
The Mayor of the town was a 
man of renown, 
A great shoemaker, and tailor, and baker, 
And doctor besides, and undertaker, 
To all the live people of Derry. 
While the mourners were all merry- making, 
himself into bed was taking, 
When Terry's dead ghost stood at the bed-post, 
And said, " Ain't you ashamed to be waking ? 
I 
don't ask your lave, to walk from my grave, 
But yer conduct is shocking, och, very, 
I 
say to yer face, ye must alter my case, 
Or I'll tell all the people of Derry. 
TERRY O'RANN .--[ CONCLUDED. 
I was buried to-day, but where I 
Jay 
Is dreadfully damp, and gives me the cramp, 
And all the wet to my body does get, 
Oeh, there's water enough for a 
ferry. 
Then what my feelings does harrow, 
I'm doubled as if' in a 
barrow, 
Wedged and tight bound, so 1 
cannot turn round, 
For my coffin's a 
wide deal too narrow, 
'us made of bad stuff—not half long enough, 
And, as sure as my name is Terry, 
I 
will not lay quiet, but kick up a 
riot, 
And haunt all the people in Derry." 
"Och, then," said the Mayor, " pray take a 
chair, 
If you'll allow, I'll measure you now, 
For a 
new coffin longer, wider and stronger, 
If that thing will make your heart merry." 
The ghost then looked up so brisk, he 
Brightened up lively and frisky, 
And said, " Och, wid pleasure, you may take my 
measure 
Whilst I 
take a 
measure of whisky. 
You needn't be told the grave's very cold, 
And does not agree with poor Terry, 
So though out by stealth, I'll drink a 
good health, 
To all the sweet lasses of Derry." 
The bottle and glass did merrily pass, 
They toasted the Queen, sung songs between, 
Till the clock struck one, which finished the fun, 
Of the rollicking ghost of poor Terry, 
The sound of the clock was a 
warning, 
Which no ghost ever was scorning, 
So tipsy and drunk away he slunk, 
To get in his grave ere morning. 
The old women say that he missed his way, 
For the coffin they did bury, 
Was quite empty found 
the turned up ground, 
To the grief of the lasses of Derry.

When dad and mammy first bought me 
To be their little joy, 
%lamed to grow, and then you see— 
Became a

They arxed me why I 
came so late, 
And said they seed me come.

Of all the sights most wondrous there, 
I 
saw the Monument, 
From which a

And headlong down be went. 
But he was saved, so I

By some brave country clown, 
Who jumped down after him quite bold, 
And caught him half way down.

Eees, they said as how they seed me come, and so 
that I 
shouldn't tumble off they had an iron cage made on the

him by one hair of his head.—Cno.

New York Harbor. 
The harbor of New York, which we make our point of departure 
from the shores of America to the Emerald Isle, is one of the fittest 
in the world, and well worthy its connection with the richest and 
most populous city in the Western Hemisphere. Far away to the 
north, stretches the Hudson, or the North Diver, with its surface 
covered with all manner of sailing craft, from the loftiest three mas-
ter, or iron steamer, down to the humble, but industrious tug. 
Toward the east, runs the turbulent body of water called " Long 
Island Sound." 
Eighteen miles distant to the South, roll the waters 
of the broad Atlantic, across which we now propose to carry our 
audience, and land safely on the shores of" Green Erin."

Five miles distant from Cork we find Blarney Castle, with its fa-

This was Ion 2; the residence of the princely race of McCarthy's, 
having been built by the great Cormac McCarthy, called the Strong, 
abon

The " Blarney Stone," to be found in the northwestern corner ot 
the tower, has long been a

tradition attributes to it the power of endowing whoever hisses it, 
with thesweet, persuasive eloquence, aml which is generally termed 
"

There is consIderablo danger attending the hissing of the " Blar-
ney Stone," making the feat all the mme pleasant to the Irishman. 
Of the stone, Father Pt-out, tbe genial Irish poet, says: 
" 
There's a

Holy Cross Abbey. 
Eight miles distant from Cashel, on the River Suir, stands the ruin 
of the once beautiful Holy Cross Abbey—a 
grand mon . stic old ruin, 
fast passing to decay. 
Tt was built about 1190, byDonald O'Brien, King of North Munster, 
and was called Holy Cross Abbey, because litre was enshrined a 
piece of the true cross on which Christ suffered death— said piece 
was set in gold and adorned with precious stones. 
Peculiar privileges belong to the Abbe and its officers, as we find 
the Abbot sat, by right, as a 
member of Parliament, under the title 
of " Baron of the Holy Cross " 
As a 
monastic rein, the Abbey of the Holy Cross ranl:s in popular 
esteem as o: e 
of the first— if not the first ecclesiastical ruin in Ire-
land. Desolation sits on every gable and broken wall. Now, the ruin 
is complete; the chancel is all open to the sky, and the birds build 
their nests in the wild ivy which creeps up the ruined walls, proving 
the truth of the poet's words: 
" 
The stateliest building man can raise. 
Is the ivy's food at last."

Seige of Limerick, August 27, 1690. 
" 
The women fought before the men, 
Each man became a 
match for ten, 
So back they pushed the villains then, 
From the City of Luimneach linn ghlas." 
[DAVIS. 
After his defeat at the Boyne, James lost no time in making his 
escape to France. He left the command of the army in heland to 
Tyreonnell, who gave orders that it should march on Limerick. 
Half the French troops had marched toward Cork on their route to 
France, and the rest followed De Lausan to Limerick. 
On the 8th of August, 1690, King William with an army of 3,800 
effective men and forty pieces of Artillery, approached the city from 
the South or left hank of the Shannon. 
After repeated denianns on the part of William to the Governor to 
surrender, and each summons to surrender being refused, Kin z 
Wil-
Boni prepared to storm the city. 
For this purpose he selected five 
hundred British grenadiers to lead the assault. 
These were to be 
supported by a 
force of ten thousand picked men, under leaders of 
undoubted valor and experience. 
Sarstield and Berwick had prepared to meet the impending attack. 
The greater part of their infantry were posted on every available 
portion of the wall ; and the guns of the Black Battery which corm 
manded the breach, were loaded with grape to rake the attacking 
columns as they emered. Other forces were held in reserve in rati-
ons portions of the city, while the streets were filled with groups of 
civilians, both men and women, determined to risk their lives in 
bravely battling for home, honor and fatherland. 
It was three o'clock in the afternoon when the signal was given for 
the assault, the British grenadiers, followed by the Dutch guards, 
entered the breach with a 
rush, and in spite of the terrible shower 
of grape, which thinned their ranks, they got to the crest of the 
breach and swept past the first lino of guards; but another shower 
of grape tore through them, and the Irish troops bore down on them 
from all sides, cutting oft their supports and nearly annihilating the 
entire assaulting column. 
The Dutch guards, however, pressed bravely on, and though re-
pulsed successively by the gallant defesders, they being steadily re-
inforced, gradualy forced their way, step by step, through the 
breach and into the town where the fighting became terrific. 
The battle bad lasted four hours, wehn William determined to 
make a 
final effort to accomplish what. as yet. arresi red a 
doubtful 
task. 
Filling the breach with his massive columns, he threw forward 
the Bradenhurg regiment to storm the Black Battery, these last suc-
ceeded in their attempt and having seized the guns turned them

against the Irish forces, who now seemed to give away on all sides. 
A cry of despair arose from the inhabitants, whose last hopes ap-
peared fading away in gloom. 
Suddenly a 
teirific explosion shook 
the city to its foundation. 
Sarsfield had sprung the mine which ran 
beneath the Black Battery, and the whole of the Braden burgers were 
blown to pieces. 
For a 
moment the combatants on both sides seemed 
paralyzed. 
Then with a 
wild cheer the Irish rushed on the panic-
stricken foe. 
The women, with disheveled hair streaming behind 
them, flew to the front, calling on the men to follow them. One last 
desperate charge, and the enemy were burled back through the 
breach in confusion and dismay, and chased into their camp by the 
victorious Irish. 
In this final assault, William lost one hundred and fifty-eight offi-
cers, and two thousand men killed. 
The Irish lass was four hundred killed and wounded, and of these, 
several were women, those glorious daughters of Erin, whose deeds 
on that eventful day will be remembered while the blue waters of 
the Shannon flows beneath the city walls', in defending which, they 
so nobly died. 
"'Twas thus was fought this glorious fight, 
By Irishmen for Ireland's right, 
May all such days have such a 
night 
As the battle of Luimneach tinn ghlas." 
(10.) The Seven Churches; or, the Cross of Clonmac-
noise. 
On a 
wild and dreary piece of grass land on theborders of the Shan-
non, which here is sluggish, and anything but noble or inviting, 
stand the time-worn relics of primitive Christianity in Ireland. 
Near 1400 years ago, St. Kieran founded here a 
seat of learning, 
but he did not live to complete the building of the seven churches 
which were finished soon after his death. The place was in good 
condition up to the year 1'201, when the work of dilapidation com-
menced by a 
sack of it under the English soldier named Fitz-'Henry. 
After this, there was but little intermission in the acts of violence, 
and then the seven churches, with their round towers deprived of 
their indwellers and their uses, were abandoned to the slower work-
firs of time. 
Ages have rolled away, and what a 
desolate spot have we left here. 
Everything in ruin save the old Cross, and McCarty's Round Tower, 
which latter is about ninety feet in height.

In that Eden of the West, 
Beauteous home, Killarney, ever fair Killarney. 
(12.) 
City o2 Water?ord. 
The capital city of county Waterford, called after the county, is 
built upon the River Suir, ninety-seven miles south southwest from 
Dublin. About the year 155 it was founded, and then was called the 
Haven of the Sun. 
In 853, it was the capital city of the Danes, and a 
Danish tower is 
still to be seen at the lower end of the Quay. 
By old Irish writers, Waterford is fcequently called the Port of the 
Thigh, from the peculiar shape of the spot of land upon which the 
city is built. 
In 1171, Earl Strongbow made war upon the Danes, took Waterford 
by storm, and put to death every Dane except the Prince and a 
few 
others, and after that time the country around was called " The Val. 
Icy of Lamentation," on account of the great slaughter. 
Among other fine buildings in Waterford there is a 
very beautiful 
Catholic cathedral, and two fine parish churches. 
(13.) 
The Vale of Ovoca. 
Two little rivers, called the Avonber,g and the A 
vonmore stealing 
forth from their secluded glens, meet here in the centre of our view, 
and the union of the two streams is called" The Meeting of the Wa-
ters." 
It is here the sweet Valley of Ovoca commences, and stretches 
away to the sea of Arldow, a 
distance of about eight miles. 
Nature has here been very bountiful, and has dealt out her beau-
ties with an unsparing hand in the Tale of Ovoca, for here we find 
verdant banks, varying woods and towering mountains, making the 
scene one of soft and lovely tranquility. 
The heart panting for re-
pose, peace and love, might well choose this locality ; and coldlin. 
deed must be the soul, and dull the sense, which could pass through 
it unmoved, or without calling to mind Tom Moore's grand song. 
The Meeting of the Waters. 
There is not in the wide world a 
valley so sweet 
As t'•e vale in whose bosom the bright waters meet ; 
Oh ! the last ay of feelinr and life must depart, 
Ere the bloom of that valley shall fade from my heart. 
Yet it was not that 
ire had shed o'er the scene 
Her purest of crystal, and brightest of green, 
it was not the soft magic of streandet or hill, 
Oh ! no it was something.more exquisite still.

The Dargle. • 
The name of the Dargle is applied to a 
long glen. through which 
the romantic River Dargle flows until it meets the Enniskery River. 
The Dargle River takes its rise in Crohan, a 
hill seventeen hundred 
and seventy feet high. 
The length of Glen Dargle is about one mile, and the rocks which 
enclose it rise in some places to the height of three hundred feet. 
The entire glen is a 
sample of a 
wooded ravine, and is exceedingly 
beautiful. 
The delicious spot in our view is a 
favorite locality for pie-nic par-
ties from Dublin ; and on the smooth turf which spreads its inviting 
carpet beside the clear stream, many a happy group can be seen in 
the summer- time singing, dancing, laughing, and dining al- fresco, 
with that perfect contempt of care and eoremony which is so peculiar 
to the Irish people, be they young or old.

Town of Bray.

This town is noted for its amusements, such as fairs, dancing, sing-

This building is said to be the finest of the kind, and for the pur-

City of Dublin. 
The dome rises to the height of one hundred and twenty feet, and 
is surmounted by a 
fine colossal statue emblematical of Hope. 
The style of architecture is of the Doric order, and the cost was 
something over two millions of dollars. 
Beside the F. tat no of Hope, there are other fine figures of a 
highly 
ornamental and artistic character. -within and without the building 
such as Wealth, Commerce, Navigation and Industry. 
It is not en. 
tirely occupied with the business of customs and exercises, dut con-
tains several government as well as civil offices.

The time consumed in building the Custom House was ten years. 
(19.) 
Sackville Street, Dublin. 
Dublin may be considered one of the most beautiful cities of the 
third class in Europe. 
It has many broad and beautiful streets, and 
many striking edifices, both public and private. In our view of Sack. 
yule Street, we have the Broadway, or principal fashionable thor-
ough- fare. 
In the centre, the Nelson Monument, a 
fluted Doric column, one 
hundred and thirty-five feet high, surmounted with a 
statue of the 
hero of Trafalgar, the cost of which was $35,000. 
On the left, stands 
the Royal Post Office, with its imposing fagade, which was built about 
1815; while on either band are many almost palatial stores and 
shops. 
(20.) 
Royal Exchange. 
With Statue of Daniel O'Connell. 
The Royal Exchange is one of the most tasteful buildings in Dub-
lin. 
It is adjoining the Castle, frontiag on Parliament Street. 
The interior is fitted up in a 
verysuperior style. The hall contains 
statues of Grattan, Daniel O'Connell, and many other celebrated Irish. 
men, all by the best sculptors of the age. 
The western front of the Royal Exchange faces on Castle Street, 
and is of the same style of architecture as the northern. 
(21.) 
Phoenix Park, Dublin. 
This is what we might call Central Park of Dublin, which is noted 
for its natural grandeur and splendor. Our picture shows a 
view 
with Wellington's Monument in the distance.

St. Patrick's Cathedral. 
This magnificent relic of Irish piety and zeal, has recently been 
restor.ed to something of its ancient grandeur, by the munificence of 
one of its wealthy citizens.

Donnybrook Fair. 
Sure ye have heard of Donnybrook Fair ! 
An Irishman in all of his glory is there 
With his sprig of shillaleh and Shamrock so green. 
Donnybrook, one of the out-parishes of Dublin City, was much 
celebrated for its annual Fair; and without Donnybrook Fair, the 
fun- loving Irish lad and lass would have thought Ireland shorn of 
much of its glory. 
Great in number were the shows ; many were the amusements; and 
vast the lights and shades of Irish life, as seen at Donnybrook Fair. 
An Irishman, in all of his glory, was there indeed ; and the very 
name of Donnybrook was the synonym of all that was lively and 
sportive, as the scene in our view plainly suggests.

Blind Girl at the Holy Well. 
Here we present a 
group of peasantry full of truth and beauty. 
Many a 
weary mile have these poor pilgrims traversed, and now they 
have reached the longed- for Holy Well. An aged man is leaning rev-
erently on his staff, beside the stone cross, contemplating the well of 
holy water. 
On the one side a 
youthful mother is instilling into the 
mind of her child a 
lesson in connexion with her peculiar creed ; 
while on the other, a young girl, all simplicity and prettiness, is 
drinking water from her hollowed hand. In the distance are seen 
toe ruins of an ancient abbey.

Rosscommon. 
View of New Ross. 
"Ross Island is usually the first place visited by strangers at Killar-
ney ; the Castle, ahighly picturesque building formerly the residence 
of O'Donaghoe, Prince of the Lakes, stands on the largest island in 
the Lower Lake, separated from the shore by a 
narrow chanmd, 
across which a 
bridge of a 
single arch connects it with the mainland. 
The neighboring ground has been improved and made the site of a 
cottage ornee, by Lord Keumare ; and the walks, young woods, and 
lawns give a 
delightful air of refinement to the vicinity. 
The sun 
was near setting when I 
reached Ross Castle, and a 
soft and golden 
flood of light covered the tosom of the lake, and the background of 
mountains and islands, with a glory inexpressibly beautiful. 
The 
side of tho ruined castle towards me lay in deep shade."

Galway.— The Claddagh. 
The City of Galway is situated on the north side of the Galway 
Bay, at the mouth of the Corrib, a 
river flowing from lough Corrib; 
the bay is eighteen miles broad, at its seaward extremity, diminish. 
lug to about eight miles inland; and it is about twenty miles long 
from East to West. 
It is protected from the swell of the Atlantic 
by the A rran Isles; the harbor has an extensive lino of quays ; the 
population at present is about twenty-five thousand. 
Galway at one time carried on a 
most extensive trade with Sie,in, 
and the style of architecture used in the old houses is of the Spanish 
quadrangular fashion. 
The ch scendants of Melisius residing in the old city seem to have 
married pretty extensively with their Iberian kindred ; for to this 
day the dark eyes and haughty expression of countenance, no charac-

teristic of the Spanish race, can be met with in Ever Stre3t, in Gal-
way. 
The Claddagh is a suburb of Galway separated from the city by 
the river 
It is principally inhabited by fishermen, a 
simple, primi-
tive race, who, until recently, spoke the Irish language exclusively, 
and were governed by their own local laws, the Magisterial authori-
ty being vested in the bands of some venerable Patriarch. 
(29.) 
Londonderry. 
Londonderry, a 
city and county of itself, is situated on the mag-
nificent River Foyle, just before that river empties into the Lough 
of the same name-
Derry was the original name of the place, but in the time ofJames 
I., of England, a 
large number of the citizens of London wishing to 
establish themselves in business there, obtained a 
chatter, and called 
the place Londonderry-, or Little London. 
From our point of view, the city presents a 
very picturesque ap-
pearance. The gradual rise of the bill seems to Le covered with 
buildings of various styles of architecture, the whole terminating 
in the graceful spire of the Cathedral of Derry, whieh crowns the 
apex of the hill. 
The beautiful Bridge was built in 179l, of American oak, and under 
the superintendence of a 
Boston builder employed for the purpose. 
It is still a 
substantial structure, though in use for near one hun-
dred years 
In length it is one thousand and eighty-six feet; and its 
cost was about $ 85,000. 
The principal trade of Londonderry, at this time, is weaving and 
bleaching linen. 
(30.) 
High Street, Belfast. 
Belfast, a 
sea-port town of County Antrim, stands on the River 
Eagan, near Belfast Bay, and eighty-eight miles northeast of Dublin. 
It is a 
very thrifty manufacturing and commercial city, cf upwards 
ot a hundred thousand population. 
With its regular streets, red 
brick houses, and numerous factories, it le -s 
nothing to distinguish 
it from cities in the same class in the United States. 
It is a 
remarkable fact. that though there was no printing press in 
Belfast before 1696—barbarous Russia, in that great art, being much 
ahead of' Christian Ee.fast— yet Belfast was the place where the first 
Bible was printed and published in Ireland, which was done in ri94. 
Digit Street, is the finest street in the city, and on it will be found 
some very beautiful public and private edifices. 
(31.) 
Giant's Causeway. 
A series of basaltic rocks, in Antrim County, on the northeast 
coast are called the Giant's Causeway, which name is given to the

group from the fact of the columns terminating at a 
uniform height . 
and thus forming, a 
tolerable smooth roadway, or causeway. 
These causeways extend a distance of eight miles, that is f,om 
I3engore to Fairhead. 
Ranges of columns of shape from the three-sided to the mime-sided 
are piled upon each other to the height sometimes of four hundred 
feet; and at Fairhead they will be found at a 
height of five hundred 
and fifty feet. 
The name of the Giant's Causeway is sometimes applied to the en-
tire coast range, but that is wrong. Pioperly, the name belongs to 
three small divisions, as the Grand Causeway, the Middle, and the 
Little Causeway, which latter is the first we come to, approaching 
from the sea. 
One of the most curious things about these columns is, there is fre-
quently found among them one column of quite difterent shape joined 
on the top of another, and on the top of this a 
third column of still 
differeet shape. 
So firmly are they joined both at top and sides, ' tis 
said that water cannot penetrate between them. As seen from the 
sea in front of them, these results at some violent upheavings of 
Nature, thousands and thousands of years ago—rank uniting the w 
en-
ders of the world.

JACOB FAITHFUL.— 
There 
has rarely been a 
man placed in a 
position so fitted for seeing the sail-
or's life as Captain Marryatt, and 
never one so able in portraying it. 
FRANK 11LIED:ITAY. — Per-
haps in no other work does Marry-
att better evince his talent than he 
does in " Frank Mildmay." None 
can beat the " Cap." 
PERCIVAL KEENE. — A 
thorough knowledge of every wish, 
hope, and fear of a 
sailor, makes 
Marryatt the best nautical novelist 
that ever lived. 
PIEIAN'FOM SHIP.— Now, if 
anybody knows more about " Wiz-
ard Skiffs" and " Flying Dutch-
men" than Marryatt, he can take 
our tarpaulin. 
'CATLIN, THE REEFER.— 
The happiest days of our existence 
were when we were " laying off " 
in the foretop of old " Irousides," 
reading this charming book to our 
all-delighted messmates. 
THE POACHER. — Marryalt 
proves that he could write as well 
of " shore" life. 
The adventures 
of Joseph Rushbrook are at once 
very extraordinary and very affect-
ing. 
POOR JACK.—The history of 
this little sea- side waif is one of the 
most genuine narratives of a 
sailor-
boy's cruise that has ever been en-
tered in the log-book of life.
