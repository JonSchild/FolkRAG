Oh here we are a 
lively pair, 
And we sing and we dance all day ; 
We are happy when we are singing, 
For it drives de blues away.

And we plant de sugar cane ; 
'We are as happy as two pretty little birds, 
Me and bright-eyed sweet Jerusha Jane. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, Jerusha, you're de sweetest creature! (Sym.) 
Come with me and see the preacher. (Sym.)

Me and bright-eyed sweet Jerusha Jane. 
Oh, we please de white folks, 
When we dance and sing de old plantation songs, 
While working in de field together, 
How de time it glides along.

How I

She is my bright-eyed sweet Jerusha Jane.

Bright-eyed Sweet Louisa. 
Written and sung by J. W. HARRiziCTON, with SULLIVAN a 
HARRING-• 
TON'S Minstr els. 
In a 
vineclad cot, where the trees are evergreen, 
There dwells a 
lovely maiden bright and ihir; 
With eyes as bright as the ever-changing sky, 
And dark brown is the color of her hair. 
She looks just like a 
little fairy queen, 
If she was here now how I 
could squeeze her; 
She has won my heart with her eyes, like Cupid's dart, 
My pretty little bright-eyed sweet Louisa. 
CHORUS. 
I 
met her in the Park one day, 
And the little birds sang to please her; 
I 
told my love to my pretty little dove, 
My bright-eyed sweet Louisa. 
We talked of love, and how happy we would be 
In the future days to come to her and me; 
When we would cling to each other through our lives, 
And from trouble and all care we would be free. 
For soon we will in happy wedlock be, 
I 
am sure I'll do my best to please her, 
For I 
love her more than my words can well express. 
My pretty little bright-eyed sweet Louisa. 
I 
met her in the park, &c. 
When We Were Lads. 
An original Burlesque on" Pinafore," introducing silent drill on Marines. 
Composed by J. W. HARRINGTON, and sung by SULLIVAN 
and HARRINGTON at the Gaiety Theatre, New Haven, 
Ct., and Aberle's New Theatre, New York City. 
When we were lads we served our time 
Washing barrels in a 
Dutch brewery; 
We washed and scrubbed the barrels so well, 
And we drank lager beer till our heads did swell. (Sym.) 
We drank lager beer till we couldn't see, 
And the owner he bounced us from the Dutch brewer 
We drank lager beer till we couldn't see, 
And the owner he bounced us from the Dutch brewery, 
We soon got elected as aldermen, 
In the noble State of New Jersey; 
We lived on mush and bales of hay, 
And we played seven-up and policy. 
We walked to Washington, D. C., 
And there got nominated for the Presidenc:. 
We walked to Washington, D. C., 
And there got nominated for the Presidency. 
Written and sung by J. W . 
H ARRINGTON. 
Oh, behold in me a 
ruined man! 
And it's known for miles around 
That my wife is training for to walk, 
And she weighs four hundred pounds. 
She has busted up the family, 
And ruined me complete ; 
She took a 
bath in kerosene oil 
For to limber her big feet. 
CHORUS. 
She drank a 
keg of lager beer 
To strengthen all her powers, 
To walk one thousand quarter miles 
In one thousand quarter hours. 
A 
man called at the house to-day, 
To train her for to walk; 
He laid the track on the parlor floor, 
And marked it out with chalk. 
She says he is a 
darling man, 
And she calls him her right bower, 
He walked out with my overcoat 
In less than half an hour. 
She drank a 
keg, &c. 
The cat and dog have left the house, 
The children too have fled, 
As for myself. I 
walk the street, 
And sleep out in the shed. 
My wife is completely off her nut, 
And she swallowed a 
barrel of flour, 
For to walk one thousand quarter miles 
In one thousand quarter hours. 
She drank a 
keg, &c. 
CHARMING LITTLE LOU, 
As performed with great success by II.tarEa & STANSII.L. 
White, Smith & Perry, Boston, Publishers. 
I'VE sang to you quite oft; before, 
Of charming girls divine; 
But now I've found a 
dearer one, 
She is a 
beau of mine. 
Her eyes are bright as evening stars, 
As soft as heavens blu ; 
Each day I 
bless the hour I 
met 
My charming, little Lou. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, yes, I 
love her dear as life, 
And to me she is true, 
I'm only waiting for the day 
I 
shall wed my little Lou. 
We met one summer's evening 
When the sun was sinking low, 
In Central Park, down by the fount, 
Where sparkling waters flow. 
She smiled so sweet, and then she blushed 
As I 
was passing by; 
Mect me to-morrow evening here, 
A 
smile was my reply. 
Oh, yes, I 
love her, (Vc. 
Sung by EDWIN BARRY. 
When forced to bid farewell to Loo, 
Pull away, my boys, pull away, 
I 
did not know what I 
should do, 
Pull away, pull away. 
I 
left her weeping on the quay, 
She said she would be true to me, 
As we sailed away to the Southern sea; 
Pull away, my boys, pull away. 
CHORUS. 
For the wind must blow, and the ship must go, 
And loving souls must part, 
For the ship will tack, and the tar come back 
To the first love of his heart. 
(Repeat.) 
But then, if false should prove my fair, 
Pull away, my boys, pull away, 
I'd burn this little lock of hair, 
Pull away, pull away. 
If she be false and I 
be free, 
I'll sail again to the Southern sea, 
Where there are plenty as good as she, 
Pull away, my boys, pull away. 
For the wind must blow, &c.

Words and Music by W. H. DELEHANTI. 
They had been boys together, 
Some fifteen years ago; 
Were fond of one another, 
Good friends, in weal or woe. 
But the iron hand of destiny 
tivided them, and so 
'.10- day they meet as strangers, 
.Dear friends of long ago. 
Dame fortune met the lucky one— 
Smiled on him—gave her ihore; 
But shunned the bold and plucky one, 
Who sailed the ocean o'er; 
The riches that came to him 
Was not his, alas ! ah, no 
He risked—lost--and losing, 1°4 
Dear friends of long ago. 
In the Park of a 
noble City, 
Struts a 
lordly millionaire; 
And his heart is moved to pity 
For another, strolling there. 
It is morning, and the lucky one 
Is out to catch the air, 
While the sad, impoverished, plucky ones 
Seess work Waki wodly fare. 
Good morning, lord and master I 
Said the poor man, bending low, 
I 
am hungry, and would work, sir, 
If I 
had the work to do. 
I 
have worked my passage over 
From cold England's selfish shore, 
And I'm looking for my friends, sir, 
For the Liends I 
knew before. 
What is your name? " Torn Roland," Sir. 
" 
Tom Roland, here's my hand, 
And all of John Day's fortune, sir, 
Is now at your command." 
" 
Why bless your heart! you're wealthy, Tom, 
Your Uncle—now laid law— 
Willed all his wealth to you, Tom— 
Dear friend of long ago." 
" 
You remember Alice Brown, Torn, 
She lives, and loves you still ; 
Come, shake hands with her brother, Tom," 
‘• Bill Brown—you bet I 
will." 
' 
And I 
was out for an appetite, Tom, 
For my breakfast." " Yes, I 
know, 
And I 
was after a 
breakfast, Bill— 
Dear friend of long ago."

DELUDED MOKE. 
BANJO SOLO. 
AM POOR unhappy cuss, 
Who's nearly broken-hearted, 
0, Crickety Jim, won't I 
give it to him, 
Who pilfered my rooster from me? 
I'm just as good a 
match, 
Since she done gone an' flew! 
Wid dat peanut peddler Pete I 
CHORUS. 
If ever I 
kotch dat moke, 
I'll but his snout, by thunder. 
I'll warm him so well 
he'll wish him in—well— 
'Taint " where the woodbine twineth," 
If dat don't make him kick 
I 
know what will—I 
spec; 
His head I 
will smash, 
Wid a 
plate of old hash— 
He'll soon ' pass in his checks." 
I 
loved di s 
damsel more. 
Den old rats love roasted cheeses, 
I 
bought her before we'd been married a 
west, 
A 
bran new set of teeth—second-hand— 
But I'll make her spit ' em out, 
Or I'll break her back—by Ju-piter! 
And make resume her 
twolloping biz,

In a

15 
CHORUS. 
To de new Jerusalam, 
She would go a 
kitin', 
Die female dead beat— 
With her peddler Pete, 
Oh he wants to give me plenty room, 
For I'll distribute him in microscopical fragments, 
I'll bite him, and gouge him as fine as mince meat, 
pat he have to be swept up wid a 
broom. 
And, now I'm what you call: 
A " busted institution," 
But I'll not take a 
chaw o' tobaccer, 
'Till that rooster an' me are " quits," 
Right over his oft eye, 
I'll put a 
nice old sham y, 
I'll whale him, until he's as blind as a 
bat. 
Then she'll get " particular fits." 
CHORUS. 
Ii make her take out those teeth, 
Shake ever stitch I 
bought her, 
She's a 
bugle-eyed fraud— 
Her ears ought to be chewed 
As well as her big turn up nose. 
But if she won't ceme back 
They can both stick off to Utah, 
And raise young nigger Mormony, 
On Brigham Young's plan, 
Those two unhealthy frauds and dead beats!

KENTUCKY HOME; 
Sung by DAVE W ALLING, ill Rose's Courtship, at the Park 
Theatre, Brooklyn, N. Y. 
DE moon is shining bright now, 
As I 
sit beside de cabin door, 
I 
am thinking of de old folks, 
Dat lived on de old Virginny shore, 
We once was happy in de old home, 
Before old master's soul did roam, 
But now the poor darkey's have to wander, 
Far from de old Kentucky home. 
Good bye, old folks, good bye, 
Now we'll have to roam, 
Since master's gone and left us, 
And our old Kentucky, home. 
HICKORY JACKSON, 
Sung by HARRY W ESTERN, in Rose's Courtship, at th€ 
Park Theatre, Brooklyn, N. Y. 
NOW kind friends do look at me, 
And an old man you will see, 
Just climbing sixty-nine but yesterday. 
I 
can tell you all a 
riddle, 
I 
can dance and play de fiddle, 
As in de days gone by of Henry Clay. 
Dm was de good old times, 
When you could save de dimes. 
But now 1em times am gone and passed away, 
'3ut give H e 
de days of old, 
And my story am soon told, 
Dais when old man Hickory Jaekson had his day . 
One thing more I'd like to say, 
Just before I 
go away, 
Of the times I 
use to have in Dixie's Land. 
I 
use to hoe de corn from de breaking of de morn, 
And many a 
cicd of earth has bruised de'e hands. 
But when de work was done, we darkey's had de fun, 
Old master got our jug and cleared de way, 
For de cld Virginny reel, 
From de toe clown to de heel, 
aeswhw old man Hickory Jackson had his day. 
Drunkard's Lone Child, 
OUT in this gloomy night sadly I 
roam, 
I've no mother now, no friends, no home 
Nobody cares for me, no one would cry, 
Even if poor little Bessie should die. 
Barefoot and tired I've wandered all da). 
Asking for work, but I'm too small, they 
On the damp ground I 
must now lay my howl, 
Father's a 
drunkard and mother is d'oacl.. 
Cuonus. 
Mother, why did you leave ra.,3 alone, 
With no one to love me, no .
fiiends and no homt. 
Dark is the night, the stoan rages wild, 
God pity Bessie, the Drunkard's Lone Child. 
We were so happy till failier drank rum, 
Then all our trouble and sorrow begun. 
Mother grew paler and wept every day, 
Baby and I 
were too hungry to play. 
Slowly they faded, and one summer night 
Found their sweet faces all silent and white. 
And with big tears slowly dropping I 
said, 
Father's a 
drunkard and mother is dead. 
Oh! if some temp'rance man only could find 
Poor, wretched father and speak very kind, 
If they could stop him from drinking, why then 
I 
should feel very happy again. 
Is it too late ? 
Men of temp'rance, please try, 
For little Bessie will soon starve and die. 
All the day long I've been begging for bread— 
Father's a 
drunkard and mother is dead.

Go to sleep, my little darling, 
Rest on mother's loving breast, 
And the angels will protect you 
When within your cradle rest ; 
Far above the starry heavens, 
They are looking down on you, 
So repose, my precious darling, 
Close your tiny eyes of blue. 
CHORUS. 
Go to sleep, my little darling, 
Rest your head on mother's breast, 
And the angels will protect you, 
When within your cradle rest.

Far a-down the dewy meadow, 
All the daises are asleep, 
And the birdies in the branches 
Also are in slumber deep. 
But in Eden far above us, 
Angel eyes are open wide, 
And you are as safe, my darling, 
E...s if they were at your side. 
Go to sleep, &c. 
In the early morning, darling, 
Little robin in the tree 
Will awake you from your slumber, 
When he sings his merry glee. 
Then I'll take you to my bosom, 
Till the glimmer on the plain 
Tells us that the sun is shining, 
And the day has come again. 
Go to sleep, &c.

With your blue and cloudless skies,

With her sweet and dreamy eyes ; 
In the meadows and the valleys 
We will gaily trip once more,

At the vine-clad cottage door.

Fairest maiden ' neath the skies.

Where you perch on twigs so high; 
Cheer us with your harmless twitter, 
Fill our hearts with new delight, 
Let the woodland ring with music, 
'Till you take your nests at night.

Through eating pickled salmon 
Before I

A 
flight of wildest fancies 
Went booming thro' my head! 
The world seem'd topsy turvy, 
And people of renown, 
Were doing the most outrageous things t 
When the world turned upside down! 
The Pope was dressed as Harlequin, 
And danced a 
Highland Fling; 
Queen Victoria came from England,

Old Barnum acted Hamlet, 
And Booth was playing clown, 
And Bismark war an acrobat

And " bossed" a

John Gough opened a " Sample room," 
And served out beer and gin; 
Old Tweed was at his Island home, 
Dressed in a 
suit of brown; 
Ben Butler had joined the Shakers 
When the world turned upside down. 
The shining Truth gleamed o'er the land, 
And Virtue—more or less ;— 
A.nd womankind gave no more 
Thought to vanity or dress; 
Al] husbands were iiko angels, 
Wives never wore a 
frown, 
And U. S. Grant said, " No Third Term 
Or the States are upside down." 
Brooklyn had changed into a 
sort 
Of Paradise on earth ; 
For it had some trials, 
And one heard no ribald.

Of all the pretty, winsome girls that ever yet were seen, 
My Uina with the jet black curls, must surely be the queen, 
She is the sweetest maiden who has ever charmed my eyes, 
And when I 
marry her I'm sure that I 
shall get a 
prize. 
CHOR 
She's like a 
little fairy, 
So winsome, light and airy, 
The queen of all the charming girls is she, my little pet, 
She fascinates the darkies all, does my Uina, my pretty 
brunette. 
In the forcst ' neath the murmuring pines, where first I met 
my love, 
Her bright eyes pierced me through and through, I 
seemed 
in heaven above, 
I 
knelt down on a 
mossy bank and offered her my heart, 
She said she'd give me her's instead, for ' twas pierced with 
Cupid's dart.

once did love a

Of course I 
was her beau ; 
I

surely ought to know. 
Fot she swore she loved me dearly, 
And I 
was dead struck really, 
Oh. she's the gal for me.

She's the gal fot me, 
She's the gal for me; 
She's big enough, fat enough, 
Thick enough, thin enough, 
She's the gal for me

year, 
My wife is still as dear; 
But when I 
rock the cradle 
It makes me feel so queer. 
Don't blush and be so shady, 
Of course I 
mean the baby. 
She's the gal, &e.

Vesey street, New York, z879. 
One summers morn while wandering, 
Down through the fields so green, 
Where the hawthorn blossoms sweetly blow, 
I 
meet Alice Aleen. 
So flaxen were her ringlets, 
Her eyes of bonny blue, 
So laughing and bewitching, 
Like a 
dart they pierced me through and through, 
CHORUS. 
When rosy May comes in with flowers, (SYln). 
To deck her gay green spreading bowers; (Sym.) 
It's then I 
love to roam with her, my little bright sunbeam, 
She is my life, my guiding star, my sweet Alice Aleen. 
In a 
shady grove far down the lane, 
In love's sweet peaceful bower, 
Beside a 
falling crystal stream, 
Oh what a 
blissful hour. 
'Twas there she whispered, " I 
am thine," 
In tones so lovingly; 
Then murmered low, " When we are wed, 
How happy, dearest, we will be." 
When rosy May, &c.

Will I 
Always be Your Darling ? 
Dedicated to FRANK HANSON. By OSCAR R. 
BEERS. 
Will I 
always be your darling,-
As we journey down life's sea? 
Will the wife be just as precious 
As the sweetheart seems to be ? 
There may be rough waves to weather, 
Over which our bark may sail, 
Do you think our hearts together 
Will ride smoothly through the gale? 
CHORUS. 
Will I 
always be your darling? 
Tell me honest, tell me true, 
If forever and forever 
I 
will be as dear to you ? 
When the silver hair shall mingle 
With the curly locks of gold, 
And my face, careworn and wrinkled, 
Tells you I am getting old ; 
Will I 
be the same dear darling, 
When shall come life's harvest days ? 
Will the love be then as ardent, 
And the lips as fondly praise ?

ORIGINAL SONG AND DA_NCE. 
By COTTON & BTEDIJE. 
When we were together, in that sunny land 
Where all's Eternal Spring, 
We'd wander through the cotton fields, 
And hear the Jay- bird sing. 
We'd hunt the Old Raccoon, 
By the glimmer of the Moon, 
Whene'er we had a 
chance. 
At evening, when the boys were on the green 
We'd join them in the festive dance! 
CHORUS. 
Gay and smiling! 
Hours beguiling! 
Oh, give us back the home we used to have. 
Down in that sunny land! 
When we were a 
courting Poll and Bess, 
Down in that sunny land; 
We'd take them rowing on the Lake, 
Or strolling on the strand ; 
We'd take the old Banjo, 
And together we would go 
And stay until the break of day! 
We wish those happy, happy days 
Had never passed away.

When My Ship Comes In. 
As sung by the FRENCH TWIN SISTERS. 
When the little birds begin to sing, 
And the sily'ry notes from their yellow throats 
Make the valleys and the woodlands ring 
With their music soft and low, 
I 
love to wander down beside the stream, 
In the twilight ray so dim, 
And I 
watch each night by the moon's pale light, 
For I'm waiting till my ship comes in. 
Ship ahoy !

Oh, my love has gone across the sea, 
For he sailed away on a 
summer's day, 
And he took my loving heart from me, 
With his uniform so grand. 
He sailed away with heart so light and gay, 
In a 
ship so neat and trial, 
And no joy I'll see till he comes back to me, 
So I'm waiting till my ship comes in. 
When the little birds, &c. 
Oh, they say heIl be a 
captain bold, 
And will have command of a 
ship so grand, 
But I'm waiting, too, for something more, 
When my love comes back to me. 
For then I 
shad be dearer far to him 
Than the rank he strove to win ; 
And my h2art beats tight, as I

Come to meet me, dearest darling, 
Where the shadows softly creep, 
In the calm and peaceful twilight, 
When the birds have gone to sleep. 
How I

All the story of our love, 
With nobody very near us 
Save the leaflets up above. 
Sweetest words to thee addressing,

Written for Miss KITTIE O'NEIL, by En. HARRIGAN 
OH! My Mary Ann is an artisan, 
In a 
factory 'way down town ; 
She makes umbrellas for the high-toned fellers, 
And she lives six stories from the ground, 
In a 
brick tenement, where they cut up devilment 
Every night in the week and every day. 
My sweet Mary Ann walks out upon tile sand, 
Ey'ry summer at Rockaway. 
Her big brother Dan is a 
laboring man, 
On the pipes he's a 
civil engineer; 
His feet are as large as a 
picnic bargoi 
lie wears gum drops in his ears, 
He has a 
voice like a 
thrush, and he feeds on mush, 
lie's fond of his sister, they say. 
Sweet Mary Ann walks out upon the sand, 
With her big brother Dan at Rockaway. 
Sweet Mary Ann plays the grand plan, 
She never studied notes from the book, 
The music clear lays all in her ear, 
As she rattles it off with her hands. 
Sunday night, when the parlor's full, 
And dear Camelia May will you give me a 
welcome here? 
Then sweet Mary Ann walks out upon the sand, 
Every summer on the beach at Rockaway.

What Are You Up To, Jane ? 
Sung by the Great Motto Vocalist, EDWIN BARRY, at Harrigan & 
Theatre Comique, Broadway, N. Y. 
Mother Jon .r.s kept a 
snug little grocery store. 
Mother Jones was obnoxious and plain, 
Mother Jones had a 
daughter both pleasing and fair, 
Whose sweet appelat ion was Jane. 
While the old one was serving tobacco or gin, 
I'd court pretty Jane on the sly, 
And oh, what sweet, glorious moments we'd have, 
Until the old woman would cry— 
ClIORt7S. 
What are you up to, Jane ? 
What are you up to, Jane? 
I 
never knew such a 
girl in my life, you're up to your 
chief again, 
What are you up to, Jane ? now what you up to, Jane ? 
I 
never knew such a 
girl in my life, you're up to your 
chief again. 
One day I 
said, Jane, would you like to be married? 
I 
fancy I 
should, said she, 
" 
So one fine morning we bolted away, 
And got married upon the " Q. T." 
We went down to Rockaway, as Jane preferred 
The seaside for the honeymoon tour, 
Out at night we'd a 
fright as I 
put out the light, 
A 
knock came at the bedroom door. 
SPOKEN.—And a 
voice through the key-hole said— 
What are you up to, Jane ? & c. 
Mother Jones was too late, for the bridal knot 
Was safely and securely tied, 
For ten years more from my mother-in-law, 
I 
kept at a 
distance wide. 
Ilia she turned up again a 
few days ago, 
When we startled the old ' uns curls, 
With a 
great surprise for her dear old eyes, 
When we mustered the boys and girls. 
SPOKEN.—As 
our " blessings" came into the room two-
by- two, like a 
healthy boarding-school, the " old ' ud 
dropped 
gracefully into the nearest coal scuttle, exclaiming— 
What are you up to Jane ? & c. 
After Twelve O'Clock. 
I'm thinking now of one dark night, 
I 
rambled on the street ; 
The gay saloons were lighted bright, 
The police on their beat. 
Should I 
relate just all I 
saw, 
Perchance your nerves l'd shock, 
For fearful are the sights ice see 
Each night past twelve o'clock. 
CHORUS. 
Come, roam the city round with me, 
Perhaps your nerves ' twill shock, 
For fearful are the sights you see 
Each night past twelve o'clock. 
Now first I 
saw a 
lab'ring men, 
While passing through a 
lane ; 
His wages he was giving fast 
For that which crazed his brain. 
His wife at home, though she was starv'd, 
The baby she must rock, 
And yet, that wretched man was drunk, 
just after twelve o'clock. 
Come, roam & c. 
And then there was another scene, 
I 
think it has been told, 
I 
saw a 
man escape from jail, 
The guard was bought with gold. 
He stole so much he is revered, 
And rich men round him flock ; 
And who can tell where this man went 
Just after twelve o'clock ! 
Come, roam, 8,:c, 
Now soon I 
reached the river's side, 
And paused there for a 
rest ; 
'Twos there I 
saw a 
poor young girl, 
Her babe clasped to her breast; 
Her marriage was a 
mockery--
She jumped out from the dock— 
A 
shriek a 
splash ! th waves rolled on, 
Just after twelve o'clock ! 
Come, roam, evc.

An original Song and Dance, sung by BARLOW BROTIIERS 
Harrigan & Hart's and Tony Pastor's Theatres. 
W ITEN we were two little coons, 
On old Virginia shore, 
The old man showed us how to dance 
Upon the cabin floor; 
The steps he learned us how to take, 
We'll show them now to you, 
And this is how we done it, 
Before we wore a 
shoe. 
CHORE'S. 
The old man learned us this rap, 
He made our toes fly flip- flap, 
Our education we did get; 
In happy days gone by, 
Old mother she would laugh at us, 
Until she'd almost cry; 
I 
wish those days would come again, 
Those happy days of yore, 
When first we learned how to dance, 
Upon the cabin floor.

[

When we hear the music play, 
We like to get a 
dance, 
To knock the dust out of the cracks, 
Because we love to dance; 
And when we get so very old, 
That we can't dance no more, 
We hope our bones will get a 
rest, 
Beneath the cabin floor.

Air.—" Pretty Red Nose." 
I'm a 
man who has seen better days, 
And wore the finest of clothes, 
But to drinking I 
took pretty hard, 
And the result is my rum-colored nose. 
In the parks I 
do sleep in the night time, 
On the ground where the green grass grows. 
But wherever I 
go all the people say no, 
When they look at my rum- colored nose. 
Cuonus. 
My rum- colored nose, oh, my rum- colored nose, 
The boys all tell me it's as red as a 
rose, 
And when I 
look in the glass, it blooms pretty fast, 
Then I 
feel for my rum- colored nose. 
The other morning I 
got up at five, 
For a 
drink to a 
ginmill I 
went, 
When the bartender wanted his pay 
I 
told him I 
hadn't a 
cent, 
Then be hit me right square in the face, 
And my eyes then commenced for to close, 
But the worst of all when the gang did bawl, 
" 
Get on to his rum-colored nose." 
C 
menus. 
My rum-cclored n3se; my rum- colored nose, 
I'll have it pulled like a 
tooth, my rum- colored nose, 
I'll take a 
lobster's claw, and steal my mother- in law, 
If she speaks of my rum- colored nose.

SOME people do say, if you marry in haste 
At leisure your sure to repent. 
I 
assure you of such things I've had quite a 
taste 
And I 
certainly to it assent. 
Now, the wrong girl I 
happened to marry one day 
however strange that seems to be, 
But they both love me still, and that makes it you know 
Exceedingly awkward for me. 
CHORUS% 
exceedingly awkward for me, 
Very awkward for me. 
I 
love both these girls, 
I 
do, ' poll my word— 
It's exceedingly awkward for me. 
Now, one of them was a 
most beautiful blonde, 
The other a 
lovely hrunettee, 
And Jodi of them seemed of me very :mid, 
And the sact is they seem to be yet. 
Now which of the two did love me the hest 
Seemed the greatest of mysteries to he, 
While I 
loved them both, and that made it you know 
Exceedingly awkward for me. 
It's exceedingly awkward for me, ci:c. 
I 
at hott married ono, and from that very day 
I 
date all my trouble and woe, 
F.r when we went out, these two always would meet 
No matter wherever we'd go, 
And diey both would glare at each other, for each 
Was as. j.;alous as jealous could be, 
And w en we'd get home my wife would make it 
Exceedingly awkward for me. 
It's exceedingly awkward for me, &c. 
Now, which of the two really loved me the best, 
I 
determined at last should be found, 
So a 
friend of mine went to them both, with this yarn, 
And told them that I 
had been drowned ; 
Of course ' twas a 
job that we both did arrange, 
And I 
know that you all will agree,. 
For had I 
really been drowned, ' twould have been strange 
And exceedingly awkward for me. 
It's exceedin2ly awkward for me, .k,c. 
When my wife heard the news she exelaimeu, 
Oh, my ! 
Are you sure lie will never come back; 
I 
feel very sorry, I'm sure I 
could cry, 
For I 
look like a 
fright dressed in black; 
And then I'll be kept in the house for a 
year 
And no company be able to see; 
how mean to die now for I've just bought some new clothes 
Oh, it's exceedingly awkward for me." 
It's exceedingly awkward for me, & e. 
:;ow, when the maiden whom I 
should have wed heard the 
news, 
She cried, and did bitterly weep, 
And said that she wished that she was dead so that she 
In the grave with her darling might sleep. 
t 
well knew them who loved me the best, 
Arid „ wished I 
unm irried might ; 
But I'm tied all my lite to an unloving wife, 
Which is exceedingly awkward for me. 
It's exceedingly awkward for me, &c. 
Sung with great success by EDWIN BARRY at the Theatre Comique. 
I 
loved a 
girl named Polly, and thought that she loved me, 
So joined a 
ship to take a 
trip across the briny sea, 
And when the morning had arrived for me to sail away, 
I 
gave the lass a 
parting kiss, and then to her did say: 
CITORUS. 
Good bye Polls-, I 
must leave you, 
Let us hope the parting will not grieve you, 
The ship it sails to- day, some thousand miles away ; 
So think of me when I 
am on the sea. 
She vowed that she'd be true to me while I 
was away, 
And thinking what she said was right, I 
left her my half pay ; 
Then with a 
sigh bid her good-bye, and as they heaved the lead, 
I 
left her standing on the shore, then jumped aboard and said: 
Good bye, Polly, & c. 
T 
saw her in my dreams at night, I 
thought of her all day, 
Put did not think that she was false to me, when far away ; 
For I 
must own when I 
alone, was lying on my bed, 
I 
often woke up in a 
fright, and these words have said: 
Good bye, Polly, & e. 
Some years had passed when I 
returned, with lots of gold 
in store, 
And just you fancy my surprise, when I 
knocked at the door. 
They told me Poll was married, she had been false to me, 
So now no more I'll stay on shore, I'm off again to sea. 
Good bye, Polly, & c.

That I

There was the " Marsellaise" p.nd the " Goot Old Fatherland," 
And the jolly songs of England and every other land. 
As I 
read them along, oh, my heart filled with joy, 
For I 
saw the old songs that I 
sung wben a 
boy ; 
'Twas our Home, Sweet Home, and the Old Arm Chair, 
And the Star Spangled Banner and Erin Go Bragh!

STOP AS LONG AS YOU USED TO. 
As sang with great success by M ISS JENNIE II EGIIES. 
I 
know a 
jolly old bachelor, 
Who lives next door to me, 
Though he is thought a 
bit of a 
bore, 
In jolly good company ; 
For he is such an inquisitive man, 
That if you e'er should meet, 
He'll button-holc, you if he can, 
And give you the following treat. 
CilOnt:S.—Does your mother take in washing ? 
Ilas she sold her mangle ? 
What's become of the old piano, 
Your sister used to strangle ? 
Has your hither plenty of work ? 
Does he still get boozed too 
Tell me all the iw.ticulars, 
And stop as long as you used to. 
Now this old man has lots of wealth, 
o 
he's not ' it hunt a 
few, 
Choice flielldS NI:holl call to di ak his health, 
And borrow a 
pound or two; 
But the old man cross-examines them so, 
That they're glad to get away, 
As rich as they came, and as out they go, 
With a 
grin on his face he will say. 
CHORUS.—Does your mother, & c. 
This bachelor's blessed with a 
lovely niece ; 
his heiress, so they say, 
So I 
thought I'd try to be in the piece, 
And told my love one day : 
"Oh! speak to my Uncle, sir," she said, 
" 
With his consent we'll wed," 
So I 
asked him if she could be my bride, 
When he drew me aside, and said. 
CHM:S.—Does your mother, & c. 
The ladies give him their sweetest smiles, 
And flatter and coax him so, 
But he can see through their artful wiles, 
Though his knowledge be does not show, 
They make him presents of gloves and ties, 
And handkerchiefs white as snow, 
Which he will wave before their eyes, 
As he asks with a 
chuckle and crow. 
CHortus.—Does your mother, &c.

Not a

For no gold your love can buy. 
Linger near me, little treasure, 
Let me look into your eyes, 
Where the sweetest violets blossom 
Underneath the summer skies. 
Put your hand in mine, my darling, 
And believe the words I 
speak 
Never any rose was fairer 
Than the roses on thy check. 
Linger near me, & c. 
Linger near me, little treasure, 
While the days are passing by, 
Meet me with a 
kiss at nightfall, 
And the love- light in your eye. 
Oh, my darling, life without you 
Would a 
dreary journey he, 
Let me keep you always near me, 
For you're all the world to me. 
Linger near me, &c.

I' ve got a 
girl and she loves me, she's the sweetest ever seen, 
She wears a 
number eleven shoe, she is my fairy queen, 
I 
took her to a 
ball, she was the pride of all, 
This charming little dear, 
But she opened all their eyes, and took them by surprise, 
-When she threw it double flip flap on her ear. 
Of all the girls you ever saw she is the boss of all, 
She's got a 
hand just like a 
ham so delicately small. 
Her mouth looks like a 
liver split, and dark green are her 
eyes, 
She's got a 
hump upon her back, and her ears are such a 
size, 
As we walk along the street, the gents all smile so sweet, 
-We're known both far and near, 
But it ' flint every body knows that I 
stand upon my nose, 
And throw a 
double flip flap on my ear.

Not so Much of it. 
Sung by EDWIN BARRY. 
Some years ago, in summer time, I 
think it was in May, 
I 
took my sweetheart Polly in the country for the day. 
I 
recollect the jolly place we stopped to have our teas, 
'Twas eighteen pence a 
head, you know, and eat just what 
you please. 
We started on the ham and eggs, and then on buttered toast, 
And then we thought we'd try and see which one could eat 
the most. 
I'd just got through three tidy plates, and Polly just the same, 
'When John the waiter shouted out, I 
see your little game. 
CHORUS. 
Not so much of it, not so much of it, 
Not any more of that, my lad ; 
Not so much of it, not so much of it, 
What do you fancy you are at, my lad ? 
We strolled down through a 
little lane and sat beneath a 
tree 
And I 
got kissing Polly there and she got kissing me. 
I 
had my arm just nicely placed around her little waist, 
And Polly'd just screwed up her lips to have another taste, 
When on the other side the tree I 
thought I 
heard a 
noise, 
And looking round saw one of those cheeky country boys, 
The yokel grinned from ear to ear, and shook his curly head, 
He kept a 
decent distance off, but this is what he said— 
Not so much of it, 8,:c. 
Soon after this I 
married her, and she's a 
happy wife, 
She's just the sort of girl, you know, to help a 
man in life. 
She keeps the house as clean as print, and always wears a 
smile, 
We have a 
rumpus now and then, just for a 
little while, 
But law ! it makes us better friends, it don't do any harm. 
There's only one thing bothers me, and gives me some alarm, 
Our family's increasing so, I 
find it doesn't pay, 
And every time a 
youngster comes I 
feel inclined to say— 
Not so much of it, &c.

It

ad K 
for Knave, and numbers 1, 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arraie ,ed in 
four rows, and are to be read aeCording to directions.

swers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. Tne 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have

standing. 
Many professional Fortune-Tellers use these cards, and we 
are in receipt of letters in relation to them from all parts of the U. S.

'ourting Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such P, way as to be non-coannittal. 
Many young ladies are visited by 
-atlemen who are either too diffi-
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. 
The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unladylike encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. 
This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi. 
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. Tre sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes a 
further explanation un-
necessary. 
The playinr, 
of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties  •
