     Background noise:  The Local IWU 63 headquarters can be a bit noisy and this can be heard 
in the background.  It's a bit industrial building, so the cooling and heating system is a regular 
problem.   Occasionally, the building generates a line noise that is impossible to keep off the 
recording.  Office workers can sometimes be heard in the background as well.

00:01  Introduction, Background information, Entering the Trade   
 
[I am here at Ironworkers Union Hall Local #63 and am doing an interview.  Please tell me your 
name.]  Hank Lichte.  [Tell me what year you were born, Hank.]  I was born 1935.  [And were 
you born here in Chicago?]  Yes.  [What neighborhood did you grow up in?]  I grew up at 
Lincoln Park area:  Armitage and Larrabee Street, it was called.  [Oh yeah, I know where that is.]  
I lived there until I got married in 1955.  [Now, were your parents German?]  Yes.  [Did you 
speak German as a kid?]  They did in the house, but when I went to school, they said no more 
German to me because I have to speak English and they didn’t want to be talking German in the 
house no more.  They would talk amongst themselves.  Yet I can’t talk German now.  I can 
understand a little bit but I can’t talk it.  [And how did you get into ironworking?  Did you come 
out of high school and go through an apprentice program or…?]  Yeah, went through an 
apprentice program.  I had a friend of mine that was an ironworker and he got me into the 
apprentice program in 1955.  [Did you go to Washburn?]  Yes.  The old Washburn Trade School.  
Yeah.   
 
1:25  [Tell me about your first job and where it was and what you were doing as an ironworker.]  
Oh.  First job as an ironworker was in Barrington, Illinois.  And it was snowing out, a very light 
snow.  The building was only about 5 stories high.  We were going to go work up on the iron and 
I figured, well, it’s snowing today, we can’t work up there.  So I asked the foreman, “What we’re 
going to do today, are we going to work?  He says, “Yeah, you’re going to work up there.”  I 
said, “How are we going to work with all the snow on the beams?”  He says, “It won’t be there 
when you get done wiping it off with this gunny sack.  Get up there and get that snow off.”  I 
wasn’t going to walk up there.  I put the gunny sack down on the beam, sat on it, and just went 
like a snow plow, across the beam, pushing all the snow off while I’m sitting on it.  That was my 
first job.  [Did you have any safety stuff on at all?]  No, no, of course not.  We didn’t have 
anything like that.  [And what kind of work were you doing?  Were you welding or just doing 
labor work or what?]  We were welding.  We were putting in railings and they had to be what we 
call pipe insert put on the beam so when they pour the concrete, the pipe would be sticking out.  
Then the railings would fit into that pipe because they were removable.   It was a little exciting 
the first day.  [Yeah, did it take a little while for you to get used to that?]  Yeah but not very long 
because you’re concentrating more on what you’re doing.  You’re trying to stay safe and it’s 
impossible to stay dry.  It worked out.  The first day was fine and after that, no problem.  [So 
after that job which was out in Barrington, did you start working more in the Chicago area or…?]  
Yeah, all over, all over the Chicago area.  We worked on…  The company I was with, I served 
my apprenticeship with them because I was what they called an indentured apprentice.  That 
means you have to sign a contract with these people and they had to honor the contract also.  I 
couldn’t quit and they couldn’t lay me off.  So they had me work 40 hours a week.  If there was 
no work, I had to go in to the shop, so that I would get my time in.  You couldn’t make any extra 
money.  It was right down to the penny.  I think when I started I made $1.55/hour.  They 
wouldn’t give you a raise until your year was up.  Then you’d go…to the next stage, 50%, 60%, 
and…  In my 4th year, I became a foreman for the company because I had been with them for so 
long.  They had to pay me foreman scale, but that was the first time I ever made any real money 
with them.  [What was the name of the company?]  David Architectural Metals.  They’re still in 
business by the way.  But they don’t do any erection any more. I think they have a contractor that 
does some erection, but they still have a shop on the South Side of Chicago.   
 
4:45   [Did you work on any…  You showed me some photographs from a job site at 2801.  Now 
that looked like that was a taller building there.]  At that time on the north side it was.  It was 29 
or 30 stories up.  See those old pictures with two guys on that cage on the outside?  You see the 
aluminum.  There was a special aluminum that fit on the corners which these guys were getting 
ready to install.  And after it was up, the building was up, these corners were leaking water.  So 
we had to go back and they set up a pole off the roof.  All it was was a six by six timber with 
some sand bags on.  They put a block out there and we had an electric hoist on the bottom, 
similar to what you see here but smaller.  We ran a cable up through to the shiv on top in the roof 
of the building and down in a boun's chair.  [Also "boatswain's chair,"  a device to suspend a 
person from a rope, a harness common to work on ships and now used to suspend people from 
high buildings.] Naturally, me being the apprentice, it was my job to go up in the bosun's chair 
and the guy on the bottom would run the machine.  I would just signal him to stop and then I 
could caulk where the leak was and we knew on every place, every floor the exact spot where the 
leak was.  Well, I probably got about 16 of the 24 and I’m signaling to the guy and he didn’t 
stop.  And this chair keeps going up and up and up and the next think I know, I see him running.   
And I go up and he’s leaving that  machine.  What’s happening here?  So I had a belt around me 
that, to hold me to the bosun's chair.  I took the belt off and I stood up on the seat and held on to 
the cable because we were getting up to 22 or 23.  I figured when we get up to the top, I’m 
getting off in a hurry because it was going to pull everything up there down.  [Down. Yeah.]  
Finally we got maybe three-fourth from the top and it stopped.  I told them to take me down 
because I passed everything already that we were supposed to caulk.  All he could do is release 
the, there was an electric brake and he had to release the brake by hand and I would go down real 
slow.  What happened was the points in the contact in the motor fused together and he couldn’t 
shut it off.  He had to run inside the fuse box and pull the, no plugs natural, go directly into the 
fuse box and he couldn’t unplug it so he ran over there and yanked the cord right out of the fuse 
box and it stopped just in time.  That was interesting on that job.   
 
7:35  [Did you have a lot of close calls like that over the years?]  Oh you have ‘em you know.  
Everybody can tell you close calls that they have.  I was working in the, we were working in the 
brewery and there was an explosion.  We were putting stairs up and we were using block and 
tackles in them days.  And I was up about 4-5 floors and there was an explosion.  And the 
people…  It was a working brewery and people in there hollered, “Ammonia, get out!”  So I was 
up on higher floors and the block and tackle was hanging down in the middle of the stairway 
opening.  So I jumped for the rope to slide down the rope on the block and tackles.  And just 
before I went for it, somebody on the floor below did and knocked it out of my way.  It just so 
happened that it didn’t go that far because I was free falling then.  And then when it swung back, 
I caught it.  I burned my hands, I only stopped about maybe a floor and half before I hit the 
bottom, but I burned all the skin off my hands when I stopped.  I slowed myself down enough 
that I didn’t, I didn’t get hurt.  So that was kind of close.  And…oh…  I don’t know.  We were 
working on the Powerhouse and I had to go change a snatch block and the hoist only went on 
certain levels.  So I went up above, slid down to where I was going to change the snatch block.  
That’s a… We put a cable in for hoisting.  And I changed that and I was going to slide down the 
column to the next level so I could walk back the beam to the hoist.  And unbeknown to me, the 
painters had painted the columns before I got down there.  I grabbed the column and slid right 
down on that wet paint.  I went sliding down and I hit the beam just below and it was also 
painted.  But there was one off to the side that they hadn’t painted yet.  So I was all full of paint 
in the front and I was able to get over to the other beam and walk back on the dry ones.  I never 
noticed, you know you’re not thinking sometimes when you’re doing stuff.  But its stuff like 
that.  We were working on Marina City, I don’t know if you…  [Oh yeah, sure.]  Well, we were 
working there and putting all the railings around the outside of it.  And I don’t know where we 
were 23 or 24, something like that.  The plasterers, the laborers were used to carry the planks out 
in the balcony, they’d hit our railing and bump, and they knew they couldn’t go any further.  
Then they could swing over to the other room inside the apartment to set up the scaffold for the 
plasterers.   Well, they got one floor ahead of us and this laborer backed out into the plank and 
there was no railing there for him to bump and went right over.  It’s…  Stuff like that happens all 
the time.   
 
10:45  [Did you see a lot of safety changes from the time you started to the time you retired?]  
Oh, all the time.  [What year did you retire?]  I retired in 2004.  [So you saw a lot of those 
changes take place then.]  Oh yeah.  I worked 25 years on the outside and then I worked 25 years 
for the Chicago Park District.  I invested as an ironworker for my pension and my business agent 
at the time told me, he says, “There aren't a lot guys that live in the city. A lot of ironworkers 
move to the suburbs.”  He says, “The Chicago Park District is looking to put someone on.  Why 
don’t you go down there and I’ll give you a letter to take it down there. Take an interview, 
maybe start yourself another pension.”  So I went down there and they says, “Yeah, we’ll hire 
you.”  It wasn’t nothing political or anything.  So I just went down and worked for them.  And 
then when I retired from the park district, they said I should come back and work one more year 
on the outside here or I had to get 1000 hours, so that’s six months.  I went back to work and 
they sent me downtown on a high rise downtown.  I hadn’t been on a high rise, so they give me a 
safety harness to put on.  I had never even seen one of these.  So the kids are telling me, “Here, 
we’ll help you get it on.”  And its got the hooks on the back and everything.  And I told them I 
said, “The last time I put something like this on,” I says, “I jumped out of a good airplane over 
Normandy.”   [LAUGHTER]   These kids believed me.  [LAUGHTER]  Like you say, safety 
stuff, we never had any of that kind of stuff.  Now there’s a scaffolds, if you're on a scaffold, 
there’s cables hanging down, you have belts on connected to the safety cables.  I never knew 
what that was.   
 
12:54  [When you started, were there a lot of Germans or ethnic groups within the union you 
were in, the ironworkers?]  No, not really.  [It wasn’t like some unions that used to be Italians, 
like the tile guys or anything…]  Yeah, like cement fitters?  [Yeah.]  No, this was pretty…  They 
were quite a few Germans in there but it was all mixed up.  Some of these guys in the pictures 
here are Irish and Polish and what have you.  It was all mixed up and all good guys.  There 
wasn’t…  We didn’t have a very good local at that time, and I don’t think there were 400-500 
members then.  Which we’re not that big now either.  I think we’re about 1200 I think.  It was all 
pretty…look out for each other and try to find work for each other.  They were good to me. 
 
13:48  [Did you guys play jokes on each other, especially with the new workers?  Was that 
something you used to do?]  No, I don’t…  [Any practical jokes?]  Well, they might have done 
some stuff once in a while but, we didn’t play around too much in the jobs.  The guys are pretty 
serious about what they were doing.  You’re up in the air working, sometimes you don’t want to 
play around too much.  I don’t remember anything.  [Did you guys have any… I  know 
sometimes for a really tall building, probably did it at Marina Towers, topped it off.  Are there 
any other kinds of things like when you finished a job or whatever, any rituals that you had?]  
Yeah, they’d have topping off parties.  In fact, the one, this 2801 here.  It was an aluminum 
building and we had a lot of aluminum scrap left over. So they scrapped the aluminum, took the 
money, and this one guy, Danny Gundlock, a big brute guy that you see looking out from 
below…  [Oh yeah, that picture.]  Yeah.  He lived out along O’Hare Field.  He got a big house 
with a lot of property.  So they had a barbecue out by his house and everybody’s talking and 
drinking beer.  Talking about stories and telling stories and is wife, a little tiny woman, she says, 
“He came home from a union meeting one night,” she said, “He’s all drunk and its 3 o’clock in 
the morning and he wakes me up,” she says.  I don’t think this woman's  even 5 feet tall.  “And 
he wanted breakfast,” she said.  “So I’m in the kitchen cooking eggs and he’s in the shower to 
wake up.  That’s when I woke up.  I got the bacon and eggs.  What am I doing here?”  She 
walked into the shower and laid a hot frying pan on his ass with the bacon in it. [LAUGHTER]   
That woke him up, she said, and he didn’t deny it.  [LAUGHTER]  There are a lot of stories like 
that. 
 
16:01 [Did you ever have to go on strike with any of the job sites you were in?]  No.  [You were 
pretty lucky here in Chicago it seems like.]  Yeah, we didn’t have any strikes all the time I was 
there.  Because I was…  They had some of the bigger jobs, but the contractors always was with, 
some of the bigger jobs went on strike but some of the smaller contractors, whatever they settled 
for, we’ll settled.  So don’t go on strike with us.  So we didn’t.  I never went on strike.  [Did you 
feel that most of the time in your career that the contractors and the union got along pretty well 
here in Chicago?]  Very well.  They really did because…  It’s a shame that you see the unions 
going down now because we worked so hard for what we did, especially safety wise.  And now 
you go and see these people working on scaffolds with no safety lines.  No nothing.  [He mean's 
non-union ironworkers] And we worked hard to get to that point and now it’s nothing.  In fact, in 
my neighborhood, they’re doing a lot of home building where I live and you see guys that are 
working Saturdays, Sundays. You know they’re not getting overtime.  [What neighborhood is 
that?]  I live at what they call the North Center.  I’m on the north side of Irving Park, Lincoln 
Avenue and Damen.  [I know where that is.]  I’ve lived there for 47 years.  It’s a nice 
neighborhood, but its not up and coming because it’s already up, but they keep tearing down 
them down and building new ones.  I’ve watched these guys working.  I could never work like 
that.  They would never let us.  [Yeah, I live over on Sheridan, not that far from you, and I see 
these job sites and see guys working with tennis shoes on and t-shirts…]  That’s exactly right.  
Yeah.  And how can they do it?  It almost seems like the government wants this…because I just 
heard that…tradesmen from Poland and people from Poland, they don’t have to have visas no 
more, they’re just bringing them in because they said we need construction workers here.  We 
don’t need construction workers.  We have plenty.  But they’re going to flood it so they can do 
all of this.  What they’re doing is union busting is what they want to do.  Bust the unions right 
down.  And then they got a good foothold.  I’m out of it, but my son is still an ironworker.  [Is he 
in #63?]  Yes.  [What does he do?]  Well, right now he’s laid off.  He’s not working right now.  
But he’s alright. He's single and put his money away.  He’s got a two flat building, so he’s 
collecting the rent.  He’s not hurting.  I’ve got it made right now since I’ve retired.  I have a 
home in Arizona and I go there in the winter time and come back here in the summertime.  What 
more can you ask for? 
 
19:30   [Well, I asked the questions I needed to ask.  Is there anything else you’d like to talk 
about, the union or the work you’ve done?  I’d be happy to hear what you have to say, if you 
want to add anything else.]  I think we’ve pretty much covered it.  I haven’t been around much 
like most of these guys here.  A lot of them work for a contractor one month or a week or a day.  
I’ve been very fortunate.  I’ve worked for the company that I served my apprenticeship with.  I 
worked for them for 12 years.  I worked for another company doing over head door works, steel 
doors and fire doors.  I worked for that company for 11 years and just a couple in between before 
I went to the Park District.  I don’t think that I’ve worked for 15 contractors in 50 years.  You 
don’t hear that.  [Yeah, you’ve had pretty steady employment the whole time.]  I did.  Yeah.  I’ve 
been very fortunate…to have a…  Of course once you get to doing doors, once you get a name 
that you do doors and that’s your specialty, you work pretty steady.    [Was that one of those 
heavy iron doors?]  Yeah.  You see them in loading docks, the big steel ones that roll up.  [Oh 
yeah.]  And O’Hare, the hanger doors.  [Oh, those great big ones.]  Yeah.  In fact, when I came 
back from retirement with the Park District, the first place I worked at was O’Hare.  We had to 
re-cable them big doors, the same ones that I worked on years ago.  [How do they put those in 
because those are really high.  That’s got to be what, 3-4 stories high at least.]  Oh yeah.  It all 
comes in sections and then you bolt it all together.  But when we re-cabled it, everything is just 
there.  Interesting though.   
 
21:33  [What did you do for the Park District?  I didn’t ask that.]  We did mostly the docks and 
the harbors.  All summer long, in the docks and the harbors.  In the winter time, there’s always 
stuff to do at the zoo.  All kinds of work in the zoo.  [With the animal cages and everything?]  
Exactly right.  We kept a crew there constantly.  Sometimes you’d get a call in the middle of the 
night.  Something would happen.  They called me one night that a lion was broken through a 
door, but it was only going to get him to another cage but they said they couldn’t have him 
wandering back and forth.  I don’t know, they called me around midnight. I get down there and 
get over there in my truck and the lion was over there and there was a small passage door, steel 
sliding door.  And its bouncing back and forth.  It’s him and I can see the claw coming up.  And I 
said, “What do you want me to do?”  I says, “I can’t get in there with this…his foot came out.”  
So they went and got a fire hose and forced it to the other side of the cage.  I was able to get in 
there and weld something on there, put some angles on it and I welded it so that at least it would 
hold until they could get him transferred somewhere else.  Then I went took care of both sides of 
the doors.  That was very interesting.  They had in the reptile house, the alligators, they had a 
swing gate down there.  And they would swing the gate and keep the alligators on one side while 
they cleaned the other side.  Then they would open the gate and push them to the other side with 
the hose.  They would go to the other side, swing the gate again, and clean the other side.  Well 
the gate was rotted out from so many years.  So they called us down there and they said, “Ok, 
we’ll hold them over here – there’s only a little hole to climb through.” And they said, “We’ll 
hold them over here and you guys take the gate off.”  I said, “What do you mean, you’re going to 
hold ‘em.”  They had a broomstick.  And they said, “If they come and poke ‘em back.”  And I 
said, “They ain’t coming on me.”  I went in there with a torch.  And if your alligator comes 
toward me, I’m going to burn him with this torch.  I’m going to shove this right down his 
mouth.”  They said, “We can’t have that.”  “Then that gate ain’t getting fixed.”  [LAUGHTER]   
So they finally got…  They got some of the gators transferred to another, just the meaner ones, to 
another cage.  And the ones that were a little more docile, they were held to the side and the 
carpenters come in there, and built like a plywood wall.  And we were able to take the gate off 
because it took us a week to build a new one.   
 
24:37   [A lot of the work, like when you did that stuff, and when I talk to ironworkers, it seems 
like they have ato have a really good knowledge.  It’s not like you take a pre-fab thing.   You’ve 
got to build that from scratch and do all that.]  Yes.  Everything in the Park District was from 
scratch because everything was so old.  You had to build everything.  In the reptile house one 
time I had to work that cage.  There was powder all over the floor.  I went into the back and said, 
“What’s this?”  And they put baking soda on the floor when a snake escapes.  They can tell 
where its at over night.  If it runs around, they can follow the marks and they know where the 
snake is.  I says, “So there’s a loose snake in here?”  “Yeah, but he made too many marks.  We 
can’t find him again.”  “See you later.” [LAUGHTER]   [What about the stuff you did along the 
water front.  Was that like in the slips and stuff?] Exactly.  We re-built the slips.  Everything rots 
out below the water or above the water, and the boats hit them. All summer long.  I would go 
there, I would start in, I tried to start in March.  There is a lot of stuff you can do because you’ve 
got to take things out of the water and some of them are called floating stars.  [Oh yeah, I know 
exactly because I live out by Montrose so I go over there.]  Okay.  We had to take those stars out 
of the water.  Sometimes dismantle them.  We’d put them on shore and we could work on shore 
at that time of the year.  In fact, they asked me…  They wanted to build…  “We need something 
to maneuver those stars when we take them apart.  You seen the fingers on the stars.  Sometimes 
we could take the fingers off and bring them back to shore and then with a crane would lift them 
off but I can lift them with my truck because I have a crane on my truck.  But we had no way to 
keep them from out there because they would tip over.  They would flip upside down.  So they 
would ask me if I could design a boat or a barge.  And I did. I did it at my kitchen table.  I made 
drawings.  I had no knowledge of this but I knew what I wanted to work with.  And I designed a 
barge and they bought the two pontoons and they asked me where they should get them.  I says, 
“Chicago Boiler would make us that.”  I went to Chicago Boiler and told them what I wanted.  
They made them.  And I made the platform, and built the barge, and put two outboard motors on 
and tool boxes.  Welder on there, a torch.  All the tools you needed were now on the barge.  And 
I put a boom on the front, a little crane on the front so it would stick out.  The finger would go in 
between these two pontoons and we would hook the other in onto the finger and lift it right up 
out of the water and take it right to shore.  It worked perfect.  [So you basically…  Did you weld 
that barge together yourself?]  Yeah, all I had was the two pontoons.  I made it all myself.  I have 
a whole roledex of pictures of the progress that we did.  It really came out nice.  [You say you 
drove your truck there.  Was that for a contractor?  Did you work for a contractor then or directly 
for the Park District.]  Directly for the Park District.  I drove a truck with a crane on it.  [Did you 
have a crew go with you then? Or was it you and…]  I would have usually myself, one 
ironworker, sometimes in the summertime when it got business, we’d have four.  And I would 
have carpenters.  I think three carpenters and maybe a laborer.  That was our crew.  And I would 
work all the way up to almost Christmas.  In fact, they had a new, what they call a district 
engineer who is in charge of the construction section that I was working at.  But I came in at 
Christmas, just before Christmas one year…the first year he was there.  He asked my foreman, 
“Who is that guy?”  He’d never seen me.  All summer long. [So you were gone all the time.]  I 
was gone all the time.  If I needed something, I’d call it in and they’d send a truck out.  And I 
would just leave my truck on the job site inside Belmont Harbor inside the building. [Oh yeah.  
Did you have to cover all the territory from Evanston and up there in Howard Street all the way 
to the South Side, doing stuff?]  We’d break at the river.  We’d do the north.  The South Side and 
Main Street, they worked out of…they took everything south of the river.  [Was that an 
interesting job because there was change all the time, you did different things?]  Yeah.  It was 
really interesting.  [And that was the stuff at the zoo, was tied in with all of that, it was all part of 
being with the Park District]  Oh yeah.  You’d get out and into the city parks.  You’d have to do 
playgrounds, fences and guard rails.  You name it.  Tennis courts.  There’s no end to it.  [And 
you had to figure it out yourself.]  Yeah.  [The fences and…]  Yeah.  Whatever you had to do.  
Buckingham Foundation.  That was ours.  Billy McClean [see interview with McClean] and I…  
You’ll probably talk to him.  We had to go and work inside one of those sea horses that shoot the 
water.  Billy scratched his initials inside of him.  And Billy’s father?  His father was the one, 
when they had the valves that made the fountain go…  His father was an engineer and he did it 
manually.  [Wow.]  Billy’s father.  He made all those…the timing and all that stuff.  His Dad 
would stay down there and it’s a little house that you can look out and the windows aren’t very 
high so you wouldn’t obstruct anyone’s vision.  He could watch the fountain and he would  do
