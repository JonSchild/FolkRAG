DON LOPER-LOPER’S TIRE SERVICE 
St. Louis, MO – December 3, 2018, 10am 
Thank you, Mr. Loper for doing this. I’m at Loper’s Service Station in St. Louis. 
Loper’s Tire Service. 
Can you tell me how the business started? 
It was started from my father. He started this business in 1950 and then I took it over when he 
passed away. 
How old were you? Did you work here with your father? 
Yes, I started working here when I was seven years old. 
What were you doing at seven? 
Well, I was around pumping gas and checking oil and jumping on some tires, you know, at the time 
we were pumping gas at this spot for Mobil Oil company, as a Mobil service station. That’s what I 
was doing. You know, just a little light stuff – but I was here. 
And he had this business…was he always in this service industry or did he do something else before he had this 
business? 
He was working in an independent packing house and then he bought this shop and he was working 
at the packing house then he just quit the packing house and worked full-time here. 
Was he married? Was your mother….? 
Yeah, a mother and a father and I got a brother. We used to live right here at 906 in this building 
right next door. This was where I had my first Christmas over there.  
Was your mother a homemaker or did she help with the business? 
My mother, she did hair. We did it over there most of the time. 
Did she have a beauty shop, or just work out of her house? 
Just worked out of the house.  
I did a project on hair and beauty shop culture. Those are special people who do hair.

Right. She had her personal customers and stuff.  
 
So you had your mom right here and you were working. As a teenager did you just continue to learn the business? 
 
As a teenager, I just sticked around and then I started loving cars. Started working on cars. I learned 
from the mechanics my daddy hired. I learned a lot from them. And I went to Old [in audible] Tech 
for a while and you know I learned about engines and how they operate and stuff. 
 
Were you always the kid that could take things a part and then put them back together? 
 
Uh huh.  
 
My brother was like that. Anything he got, anything, any present…he’d take it a part first. 
 
You know I learned from the guys. We learned how to fix on cars. We weren’t taking them a part 
then. And there’s so many different things new. Cars is hard to keep up with. The new cars are so 
complex now, they’re really…you’ve got to really be a computer wiz. 
 
When did it become a tire [shop]? First it was a service station, you had gas pumps here and when did it turn into a 
mechanic… 
 
Yeah, mechanic and tire shop. We always did a little mechanic work, you understand, but now we 
just, by us not pumping any gas or anything, we just do tires and I do a little mechanic work and I 
do a little towing. I got an old tow truck. We do a little towing, to make ends meet, that’s about all. 
Because this place is not on a main drag no more. This was a long time ago. This used to be a 
commercial area. It’s not no more. They rezoned this and ‘aint that many cars come up and down 
this street, like Kingshighway, Page, Delmar…If we had that kind of traffic flow, I’d be way better 
off. 
 
So do you just have a core group of regular customers you’ve had over the years? 
 
Yeah, mostly it’s neighborhood customers. [5:00] People you know moving in, you know [there’s a] 
little tire shop around the corner, you know. They come and you know trade with me and 
everything. You know most of the people who live around here, you know, kind of poor, you 
understand. They don’t have the kind of money, you know to buy no brand new tire. A brand new 
[tire] cost eighty, ninety dollars. So we just…I sell used tires and fix cars as cheap as possible, buy my 
Porsche here are there, you know. 
 
That’s what most people want in a mechanic, is to try and save you money, if they can. And that’s not what we get 
most of the time so.  
 
What percentage of your clientele would you estimate are black? 
 
Most…all of them. I have some white people who come. They’re looking on the internet and they 
come buy tires because they’re close around. Course over on Delmar on the central-west end, they 
come over here and buy tires.

Are you on Yelp? How do they find you? 
 
They look up under “Tires” I guess. 
 
Oh, do you have a website? 
 
I should have one. My grandkids set all this stuff up, and they gone now, but you know they gone to 
school. Some of them got they own business. I haven’t really been interested in the computer.  
 
Are there any siblings? What’s going to happen to the business? 
 
I don’t know. See once this property leave out the Loper’s name, it can’t never be a business no 
more. Because they done rezoned it. I’m the only one, I get my license every year because I’m 
grandpa’d (grandfathered) in. But after that it never could be a shop no more. 
 
So you’re offspring, if you have your children…? 
 
Yeah, they could come in. It’s got to be in the Loper’s name. They’ve got to be a Loper [to] even 
take it over. That’s how I get to take it over because, I’m a Loper.  
 
You don’t have any sons that want to take it over. 
 
No, all my sons is college boys and they ‘aint going to get too dirty. I mean they have got dirty, 
they’ve grown up around here, but you know they ‘aint going to get too dirty. And you know my 
grandkids, they don’t want to get dirty either. So I don’t know, you know. I don’t know what’s going 
to happen to this place. I’m probably going to put it on the market, next year. You know, and get rid 
of it. Because it’s just been too…I’m at the age where I can hardly handle it no more. And you can’t 
find good help, you know. All kind of stuff. 
 
How many employees do you have? 
 
I’ve got one guy working with me now. You know, he’s not no mechanic, he’s just a…he keeps the 
books and talk to the customers. I do all the mechanic work, understand. I’m getting tired of it, you 
know what I’m sayin’. We work six days a week, eleven hours a day, some days longer, some days 
shorter. We just makin’ ends meet. I just need the income. For real. 
 
It’s amazing that this was in the Green Book. I don’t know if this could bring you business, but people will be very 
excited and interested that you’re here. That this business is still operating. 
 
Yeah, most of all these people that was around here, when I was a kid, they gone. There’s a couple, 
you know about a handful of people around here that was around here when I was a kid. You know 
growed up around here. But most of all these people trying to sell drugs up and down this street. 
You know it’s just rough. All over. 
 
And it wasn’t like that before? 
 
No.

What was it like when you were growing up? 
 
When I was growing up, it was a nice neighborhood. I don’t know, maybe I wasn’t paying attention 
to the drugs but there weren’t people standing on the corners trying to sell drugs. You know there’s 
shooting around here every day, you know, everything. It’s just rough. I gets into arguments with 
some of these kids, but you know that’s normal, because they don’t have respect for each other, so 
you know they’re not going to have respect. So we just try to maintain and you know, stay out they 
way, so they can stay out of our way.  
 
Has any violence ever happened here on the premises? 
 
 
No, it’s always happening out in the streets. Shooting at each other, you know, all that. And then to 
be trying to sell drugs up and down, over here, over across…stand over there, I have to try to run 
them away, you know. 
 
How do you do that? 
 
I tell them they can’t post up out there, you understand. So some of them respect me and move on 
and some of them, I would have to…you know, threaten to call the police or something. 
 
But you never have? 
 
No. 
 
It’s too bad. I’m finding that a lot of these Green Book sites were in traditional black communities that have changed.  
 
Yeah, but see white people are buying all these properties up over here.  
 
Really. So it’s becoming gentrified now? 
 
No, they just buying it up. These big old houses and everything around here, because they finnin’ to 
move back over here. This is the central-west end but it starts right there at Delmar but they gonna 
come all the way to Martin Luther King up here and they buying all this stuff up. They just waiting 
to tear…they running all the way down so they can get this property cheap and then they fixing it 
back up. 
 
So what kind of man, do you think, your father, I’m assuming he listed the shop in the Green Book. It was listed in 
1959. I’m wondering, did he ever talk about black travelers, or race? Because this Green Book was such a significant 
guide to help people find services, whether they needed the car towed, or whether they needed gas station…a lot of times 
most white businesses wouldn’t serve them at that time. That’s why the Green Book was so important. Did he ever 
talk to you about race as a kid, or traveling? 
 
No.  
 
He never mentioned the Green Books? 
 
The Green Book: Documenting African American Entrepreneurs, afc2018/029

No. He never had mentioned the Green Book. My dad, he stayed stressed out around here, like I do. I 
be stressed out every day, you understand. Now the Green Book, [today] anything you want to know, 
now you read it on the internet, right? That’s what everybody’s doing now. What they say, is that if 
you don’t want the black people to know it, just put it in the book. They wont know it, because they 
don’t want to pick up a book. They don’t want to pick it up and read. My wife has got a bad habit of 
telling me the same thing, you know, because I won’t stop and pick up no book and read, that’s all 
you got to do. But I’m on the same path that he was, just come to work every day and go back 
home. But I just got a different hobby than my dad. I got an old race car. I race. And that’s a 
pastime for me but it’s so expensive. I’m too old to pay that kind of money on cars and stuff.  
 
So do you race the cars, or do you just like to have the cars? 
 
No, I race the cars. 
 
Where do you race the cars? 
 
Gateway International Raceway, in Illinois. We go all over, though. 
 
How long have you been doing that? 
 
We’ve been doing it about 15 years. 
 
But it’s expensive to maintain the cars? 
 
Oh, yeah. Very expensive. They always need something. Plus, I’ve got a lot of old cars at home and 
I’m trying to maintain them. 
 
What cars do you have that you’re proud of? 
 
[Pointing to a picture on the wall] That’s my ’67 Chevy convertible.  
 
Wow, that’s beautiful.  
 
That’s my old racecar, right there. The black one. 
 
What is it? 
 
It’s a ’77 TransAm. There’s a better picture on the wall, right there. That’s how it looked at first, see 
that grey car, the grey car. I done tore that car up and made it out a race car and everything else. And 
the car is worth more money like that, than it is as a race car. 
 
But maybe that one gives you more pleasure, right? Do you have more fun with that one? 
 
No, I’m going to get rid of all of them sooner or later, though. But that’s the race car there. It’s just 
something to spend money on that I don’t have, you know. It just keeps me from being in the street. 
I don’t go to taverns and hang out. I don’t do that no more. I used to, but I guess I done got too old 
for that. You know hanging out, cause that’s where the trouble come in. 
 
The Green Book: Documenting African American Entrepreneurs, afc2018/029

I don’t hang out either [laughing]. What does your wife do? 
 
My wife, she was at [inaudible]. She was in shipping and receiving at [???] she worked at the 
warehouse and then they lost their contract. There’s a new contract up there now. She got laid off. 
She’s trying to find a job. But she’s doing all right - she good. 
 
Do you live in your parent’s house? Do you live around here? 
 
No, I live in North St. Louis.  
 
[17:26] 
 
My mom passed, so we took her old house and lived in it, because if we didn’t live in it, it was going 
to get tore up because people would break into it and stealing the plumbing and all. You know what 
I’m saying. It was paid for so that’s a blessing. We got a house that’s paid for I guess we can do the 
maintenance on it [laughing]. We ‘aint got to pay no note, so we took that over and tried to maintain 
that. 
 
That’s great. So back to the business. Was there ever a time when you were going to have to close it, or there was going 
to be… 
 
Well I feel like that now. We’re going to have to close it, because it’s not, it’s not…payable…I don’t 
have the volume of people coming through here, you know.  
 
So what do you think would make it more of a viable business? 
 
A main drag on a main street, then the people would know. You put it on an advertisement, and 
they’re scared to come down here. People are scared to come down here. They ain’t going to come 
down here and people shooting up and down the street, somebody get killed over there the other 
day and the other night…they just ain’t gonna do it. And you can’t blame them. You can’t blame 
them. We was out here working the other day. Kids ran and hit a car and jumped out and ran, you 
know, all that. That’s how my old truck got messed up. It was parked over there across the street 
[where my car was currently parked]. Somebody rammed in the back of it. Parked. 
 
[A customer comes in] 
 
What were we talking about? The neighborhood. 
 
Yes, the neighborhood is kinda rough. I mean, it’s just…it’s just bad around here…bunch of people, 
you know most everybody around here is trying to sell drugs. 
 
[he takes a phone call] 
 
When did the drugs come in? 
 
The drugs been coming…they really…it really got rough in about ’95, something like that. It’s 
mostly, the people, they don’t even live around here. They don’t live in this neighborhood, they 
come out another neighborhood and come over here and sell drugs, they have their friends coming 
The Green Book: Documenting African American Entrepreneurs, afc2018/029

over here and everything else. Then they go back where they live at. They don’t live around here. 
That’s what makes it so [bad] and you can see a bunch of police ride by and they don’t say anything 
you, you know about the people bunched up all together. It’s a vacant house across the street over 
there, there will be about five or six people on the porch. I mean, for what? It’s a vacant house so 
the police should see what are all these people doing. They’re not working, they don’t have any 
tools. You know what I mean? They just hanging out, selling drugs. That’s what they do. Ain’t 
nobody said nothing so, no problems on this side…and over there…I don’t let them sit in front of 
my house. I just ask them to leave, so they go across the street and Mr. Willie [assumed spelling], he 
own all that property over there, so he kinda keeps them from standing all over there, you know 
from selling drugs, flagging cars. You know they don’t have no respect for nobody, they just double-
parked in the street and cut the motor off. I mean this is how it is down here. And you can’t hardly 
take a credit card or nothing because they come through and you know fraud you with a credit card 
and you do some work, you know, put some tires on a car or something, then you run their card and 
the card ain’t no good. Then what? I have to take my tires back off or argue with them. [They say] 
“You can’t keep my car…” So one time, we were working on a car and a guy, we told him what it 
was going to be and he said “Go on and fix it.” So when we got through fixing it he didn’t have 
nothing but…the bill came up to $60 or $70 and he didn’t have nothing but $20 so he gonna tell us 
he gonna bring our money back, I said yeah well you can, but you can’t take your vehicle. You 
understand. So he cussin’ and all that. So I said, why don’t you call the police, because you gonna 
need them in a few minutes. You know what I’m saying. So he called the police and the police told 
him to pay us or leave, so that’s how we got paid, he had to call the police. 
 
So he found the money. 
 
Yeah, he went and found the money from somewhere. Because I was going to keep his car. He 
thought he was going to take his car with him and pay me later. 
 
And how often does that happen? 
 
Whew! All the time. All the time. They want you to do this and do that, but you now. But most of 
the people who come to buy tires, then we tell them the price of the tire before we even do 
anything, and we don’t take nothing but cash. We don’t take no credit cards. So most people, if 
they’ve got an ATM card then they can run up to the ATM machine and get the money and come 
on back. And the ladies, most of the women, some of them try to be tricky but it’s the men that’s 
the ones. There was a lady that came around here and said we worked on her car and put a water 
pump on it. I said, “Well show us the receipt.” So she showed us the receipt, and the receipt got a 
water pump wrote on it, it’s up in the corner of the ticket and we don’t sign it, or do no nothing like 
that. If we did a water pump we are going to put it on the ticket where it’s supposed to go. It got 
water pump wrote up in the corner. I said, “No, we…” She tried to say we did that and we know we 
ain’t did that. So they just full of tricks and everything around here. We just live through it and keep 
going. 
 
[26:24] 
 
So you don’t take credit cards because you think they’ve may have been stolen? 
 
Well most of them be stolen, coming from around here. They’ll steal a card and then try to use it. 
They use it down here and then and it’s too much worrying about the police or getting in trouble 
The Green Book: Documenting African American Entrepreneurs, afc2018/029

because they are down here and if anything comes about they can take off running because they 
know most likely, I ain’t going to call the police. You know what I’m saying. 
 
So why wouldn’t you call the police. I’m just curious…I can guess. 
 
Well by the time the police come they’re going to be gone anyway. And you can call the police and it 
will be two to three hours before they get down here. 
 
So do you ever see any police brutality down here? Or they just don’t even care since they’re not here. 
 
Well the police, they don’t care, you know what I’m saying? They really don’t care what’s going on 
down here. They really don’t care. They just, you know, they’ll stop if somebody call them, but 
they’ll take an hour, two hours, for them to come…maybe. Sometimes we’ll call and they’ll say, “We 
ain’t got time for that right now.” You understand. Whatever. 
 
In terms of the business that is more reliable, it’s just getting less and less and that’s why you feel… 
 
Right. It’s business falling off. If it was on the main drag, I wouldn’t mind expanding. You know my 
grandkids, I try to get them…but you know they can’t make enough money down here, I don’t 
think. I don’t know. They could, if they established themselves doing special work, you know like 
mufflers or catalytic converters or aluminum wheels. Something special, you know what I’m saying. 
But just ordinary mechanic work, it would be hard to get people down here because you’ve got to be 
competitive where most everybody else price. It might be two dollars cheaper or three dollars 
cheaper but the part is still going to cost the same. 
 
And all of the computer stuff now too so it’s just a different ballgame. 
 
Hmm mmm, right. And then when you buy from the parts store, some give you a better discount, 
other parts store…and you know if you don’t get enough of a discount on it to charge people, you 
understand? So the average fuel pump costs $90, $100 which if it costs me $100 and I put $20 on it 
for…as a discount, so the walk-in price would be about $130 so you could get it for that, so why you 
gonna give me $130 and you can walk in there and get it for maybe $125, or maybe $120? It depends 
on where you go, what company you deal with. You can go online and get it cheaper than that. 
 
Somebody’s still got to put it in for you. 
 
Right. The labor, we usually charge about $125 to put a fuel pump in, but like I tell the people, I 
can’t guarantee it because they bought the fuel pump, if anything happens, that’s on you, because 
you bought it. If I bought the fuel pump, I would have to guarantee it and the labor. So that’s the 
difference. And a whole lot of people don’t understand that. They want me to buy the pump and sell 
the pump for the same price I bought it for. Can’t do that. Can’t make no money like that. 
 
Well, I don’t know what other garages, or mechanics do. Do you think it’s the industry that’s struggling all over? 
 
Yes, it is. They whole industry is going down because the car dealer is going to end up doing the 
work. Because they’ve got the car so complex now, you’ve got to take it back to them. These new 
cars, 2017-18, hey, they rough, you got to take it back to the dealer. It’d be best to. Because you 
The Green Book: Documenting African American Entrepreneurs, afc2018/029

don’t know, a little shop like this couldn’t handle it. Don’t have the equipment, don’t have the 
knowledge, don’t have none of that. 
 
I have a fairly new car, a Honda, across the street. And I grew up with a brother who worked on cars and we never 
went to the dealer, but I can understand [what you’re saying] because if the camera light is out or whatever…so I’d 
like to go to smaller businesses and you’re saying I probably shouldn’t? 
 
Yeah, because you don’t know what they don’t know on these new cars. Or are they guessing? You 
never know. Shoot. The headlights, you have to take the front end off for half of them to put a 
headlight bulb in.  
 
The whole front end? You have to take it off? 
 
Yeah. Take it off. They’re making them like that so you have to bring it back to the dealer. You’d 
come here and I’d charge you $75 to put a headlight bulb in, you’d think that was too much. 
 
Yeah, usually, you’d take it off yourself and put it in. 
 
Yeah. Right. But now, they’ve got it fixed. If I charge you $75, the Chevrolet dealer, they’re going to 
charge you a hundred bucks. They got it going on. The only [reason] why we’re getting the specs and 
everything on these cars is the government is making them put it out there but they’re telling the 
government that’s why they aint’ making no money, because everybody selling they parts and doing 
everything and putting the parts on they car, you understand? But if they didn’t have the information 
about the car, they couldn’t do nothing. They government is making them do that. So it’s going to 
come to an end, you know. They’re getting paid for what they know, not what they do. That’s what 
they’re getting paid now, these car dealers and stuff. When something happens to your car, they 
already know what’s wrong with it. And they’re going to charge you $100 for the diagnostics on it 
and then they’ll go from there, but they already know what’s wrong because your car ain’t the first 
one that did it. See, they already know. It’s just a matter of time when all these little shops like this, 
just go away. You might need a used tire, but then they going to get kind of complex - they got 
sensors in the wheels and tires and stuff. 
 
Does that have something to do when you stop? 
 
No, it’s for your air pressure. When your air pressure gets low? It tell you your air pressure, which 
tire it is, all that. See that’s a sensor in there. Now, if you don’t know what you’re doing, you break 
that tire down and bust the sensor. It’s really. 
 
Even tires. Just a standard… 
 
Hmmm mmm, even tires. And they got so many sensors on the tires, that you’ve got to know where 
they’re at so you don’t damage them.  
 
Do they sell tires with sensors on them? 
 
Yeah, your car’s got sensors that come with it.  
 
I know, but if I’ve got a flat tire and it needed a new one. So if I go to Goodyear… 
The Green Book: Documenting African American Entrepreneurs, afc2018/029

Yeah, you can get another tire, but he’s got to watch for that sensor so he doesn’t damage it putting 
the new tire one. That’s the thing. And once it’s flat, you can’t ride on it because you’ll tear the 
sensors up.  
 
 
36:27 
 
You’ll see it’s flat because it’s going to show on the dash. You’ve got to stop right then and then put 
your little spare on and all that. When you go to the tire shop, now he’s got to look at the tire and 
know it’s got a sensor in it. Now, he can’t break than tire down on the sensor because he’s going to 
tear it up. It’s big. You’ve got sensors and everything else. So, a little shop like this, they are going to 
by the wayside. It’s just a matter of time.

[We look at pictures and talk about his dog]  
 
 
Yeah,
