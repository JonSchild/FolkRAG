OVER TM,: GARDEN WALL. 
OR, 
my love stood under the walnut tree, 
Over the garden \van. 
She whispered and said she'd be true to me, 
Over the garden wall. 
She'd beautiful eyes and beautiful hair, 
She Was not very tall, so she stood on a 
chair 
And many a 
time I 
have kissed her there, 
Over the garden wall. 
CHORUS. 
Over the garden wall, 
The sweetest girl of all, 
There never was yet such eyes of jet, 
And you may bet I'll never forget 
The night our lips in kisses met, 
Over the garden wall. 
But her father stamp'd, and her father raved, 
Over the garden wall, 
And like an old madman he behaved, 
Over the garden wall. 
She made me a 
bouquet of roses red, 
But immediately I 
popped up my head, 
He gave me a 
bucket of water instead, 
Over the garden wall. 
Over the garden wall, etc. 
One day I 
jumped down on the other side, 
Over the garden wall, 
And she bravely promised to be my bride, 
Over the garden wall. 
But she screamed in fright, " Here's father, quick! 
I 
have an impression he's bringing a 
stick 
But I 
brought the impression of half a 
brick 
Over the garden wall. 
Over the garden wall, etc. 
But where there's a 
will there's always a 
way, 
Over the garden wall. 
There's always a 
night as well as a 
day, 
Over the garden wall. 
We hadn't much money, but weddings are cheap, 
So while the old fellow was snoring asleep, 
With a 
lad and a 
ladder she managed to creep 
Over the garden wall. 
Over the garden wall, etc,. 
DANCE ME ON YOUR KNEE. 
Sung with great success by Miss MINNIE LEE. 
W HEN I 
was very young how fond I 
was of childish joys; 
I 
loved to play among the girls, but better with the boys : 
It was pussy in the corner, tag and ineminie, 
And when my ma put me in bed I 
would steal out on the 
sly. 
I 
dared not make the slightest noise when getting back in 
bed, 
The biggest boy would boost me in my window over-
head; 
I 
would go to sleep and dream I 
was a 
lady young and 
gay, 
And when my ma would take me up to her I 
used to say; 
CHORUS. 
Dance me on your knee, mother, dance me on your 
knee; 
Clasp your arms around my waist, it won't hurt me. 
Hold me tight, don't let me fall, I 
won't be afraid at 
all, 
Dance me, mother, dance me on your knee. 
But when I 
wore long dresses first the little boys I 
shook, 
As my ideas developed the bigger ones I 
took, 
Instead of childish games it was parties, social balls and 
drives. 
here'er I 
went I 
had my favorite escort by my side. 
at when I 
tire of one young man, another soon I 
take, 
For there's a 
way of knowing how to give the boys a 
quiet 
• 
shake. 
And when I 
wish to call one back a 
smile would win the 
day — 
I 
need but look upon his face and coaxingly this say : 
Dance me on your knee, etc. 
I 
want to find a 
lover that will undertake the task, 
And understand just what I 
want, and never have to ask. 
If such can recommend himself I 
pray don't backward be, 
But be sure you're brave aud strong enough to dance me 
on your knee. 
There's many a 
wish a 
young girl has she don't like to 
express, 
There's many a 
time we nnswer no, and heartily mean 
yes. 
I 
always warn the fellows when we are sitting all alone, 
Be sure don't rumple up my clothes, when you dance me 
on your knee. 
Dance me on your knee, etc.

YACHTING IN THE BAY. 
Words by Wm. F. BACON. 
Music by Lou DINSHOltit. 
Sung with immense success by JEPPE. 
THERE'S many pleasures in this life, 
But none that can compare 
With the one I'm going to sing of, 
Perhaps you have been there. 
With pretty eirls, and jolly boys, 
All full of fun, I 
say, 
It's splendid on a 
moonlight night, 
A- yachting in the bay. 
CIIORUS. 
Oh, yachting in the bay, my boys, 
Yes, yachting in the bay ; 
There's nothing to enjoy so much 
As yachting in the bay. 
Here's Ella, Sue, and Hattie, too, 
A- coming down the wharf; 
And Ella's friend, and Hattie's ma 
Are here to see them off. 
Now all aboard ! aye, steady there, 
Your bia toot's ia my way; 
Up goes the mainsail, and we're off; 
A- yachting in the bay. 
Oh, yachting, eft; 
And now the " Belle" begins to toss, 
Likewise the " yachters," too ; 
And Sue and Hat they both exclaim, 
" 
Good Lord ! what shall we do 
Oh, dear, I 
feel so awful sick !" 
We hear the land lubs say: 
" 
I 
wish I 
never had come down 
A-yachting in the bay." 
Oh, yachting, etc. 
" 
Oh, let's go home I Oh, please go home !" 
The oirls in one voice said ; 
" 
We want our dear mammas to put 
in our little bed." 
We soon in calmer water got, 
And then we felt quite any ; 
For we " spliced the mainbnce

From yachting in the bay.

PET OF THE SERVANT GIRLS. 
Poetry by ROBE= Itc1CAr. 
I'm one of the force, you'll observe, 
My name cannot matter to you; 
My number is plain if ' twill serve, 
It's 3t1-9-42; 
My beat's on the west side of town, 
Where the tipper ten most congregate, 
Up this way one minute, then down 
The other way, early and late. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, my duties are very arduous. 
In fact, I 
should 
throw up my position were it not for the dear servant girls, who 
do all in their power to make my lot pleasant. 
Why, it was 
only the other evening one sweet creature informed me that I 
was--
CHORUS. 
The pet of,the servant girls, 
With my light mustache and curls; 
When l'm on my beat they smile so sweet 
On the pet of the, servant girls. 
Of course I 
make love to them all, 
And swear I'm a 
single man ; 
Then promise some evening to call 
On Eliza, Matilda, or Ann ; 
They take it all in ; but, dear me, 
Were my wifo the iirranr,eent zo know, 
She'd fall to the game; then, you see, 
My nice little cake would be dough, 
SPOKEN.— Decidedly, it would never do to allow ber to make 
the discovery that I 
was 
The pet of the servant girls, etc. 
If the city would increase our pay, 
I'd marry the girls every one, 
And when off duty each day 
I'd have, oh, flood gracious, such fun ; 
But then of course that cannot be 
While the people in cffice keep churls, 
Who think very different from me, 
The pet of the servant girls. 
8POKEN.— Never mind, brother cops. 
Wait till 
the women 
get the right to vote. 
Then we shall see who will control the 
affairs of the city. 
Who I 
why, who but— 
The pet of the servant girls, etc.

I WAS DESPISED BECAUSE / WAS POOR. 
Farewel, false girls, I 
leave you in sorrow and in pain. 
My absence cannot grieve you, soon you'll bear a 
stranger's name. 
I'm forsaken for another, one with gold in store; 
Then farewell father and mother, I'm despised for being pee-
We have lived and loved from childhood, and vowel we ne'er 
would part. 
Passed mans' hours in the wild wood 'gut she has nearly breke 
my heart, 
There came a 
wealthy stranger, just from a 
foreign shore, 
He woo'd, and soon he gained her from me for I 
was poor. 
When wed the bells were chiming, as the carriage it pass'd by, 
The lads and ! asses smiling but a 
tear bedimn'd her eye, 
Farewell vain girl, the ocean will part us evermore 
I 
lov'd you with devotton, but was scorned for being poor. 
I 
shall never more behold her, nor hear her sweet voice again. 
I've enlisted for a 
soldier, to die on the battle plain; 
May sorrow ne'er distress her, but lappiness in store, 
And yet loving I 
will bless her, though despised for being poor.

PACES IN Tu FIRE. 
By GEORGE R OM 
IITE oft in boyhood crept up to the fire 
And watched the faces fashioned by the blaze, 
Which soon as formed as quickly would retir 
As do the fancies of our younger days. 
And even now, when in mature old age, 
I 
watch the faces as they come and go. 
They form a 
story written on life's page— 
A 
story full of weal and full of woe. 
I 
there have seen my own face as a 
boy, 
All wreathed in smiles, unknown to grief or care, 
Beyond the breaking of some favorite toy— 
A 
face on which its thoughts were all laid bare. 
Look at it now, as left by Time's hard hand— 
For care and sorrow both have made their mark— 
My brow's as withered as you burning brand ; 
My smile e'en pales beside the flickering spark. 
And sometimes faces we have learnt to loathe 
Our fancy shapes beneath our very eyes, 
And dearest friends beside the bitterest foes 
From out the embers steadily arke. 
Oh, if we knew but where to draw the line 
'Twixt loving hearts and hearts as black as night, 
About our lives then fondly would entwine 
Some flowering shrub instead of parasite. 
And oft methought the fire would blaze anew, 
And then a 
group of little faces came, 
Whose beaming eyes have thrilled me thro' and thro', 
Whose smiles outvied the brig-htness of the flame. 
What man can look on such a 
happy scene 
And feel no pride or joy within him rife '1 
Such little faces gathered there are e'en 
The stepping- stones in every father's life. 
And then a 
brighter face than all the rest 
Would lovingly look up from out the blaze, 
And make me think that all my life was blest, 
In having one so good to cheer my days. 
For, though from clime to clime a 
man may roam, 
He finds how dreary soon becomes his life, 
Without a 
purpose and without a 
home, 
Without a 
faithful, true, and loving wife. 
And so I 
often wheel my easy chair 
Toward the bright and ever cheerful blaze, 
And hour by hour I 
sit before it there, 
And think upon my boyhood's joysome days. 
So will my children do when I 
am gone, 
For this same fancy they will soon acquire, 
And often sit until the morning's dawn, 
To gaze upon the Faces in the Fire.

When he goes in for " odd-man-out," 
He's never known to fail, 
When other people turn up head, 
He's sure to turn up tail; 
lie gets his drink upon the cheap, 
He never has to pay; 
Again I 
ask how this is done, 
And again his friends will say:--- Cho. 
3 He dresses in the first of style, 
And when the ladies they 
Meet the follow in the park, 
They to each other say: 
"Oh ! isn't he a 
dear young man," 
And what they say is true; 
He gets acquainted with the girls, 
And with their money, too. 
SPOKEN :— Simply becauss 
4 He keeps a 
very stylish house, 
Some distance out of town; 
And if he knows you bold the coin, 
lie will invite you down; 
Then introduce a 
game of cards 
As soon as you get in: 
And. strange to say, whene'er you play, 
The fellow's sure to win.—ao. 
I'VE heard men say when marriea they could not go out 
at night 
Without their wives, which makes their lives a 
burden to 
them quite; 
Their wives would prate if they out late should dare at-
tempt to stay, 
But I 
confess they'd not do this if treated in this way. 
CHORUS. 
Smooth her gently down the face, then your arm you 
gently place 
Round her neck, don't forget, then if you she's scorning, 
Give her a 
kiss, a 
fond caress, tell her you'll buy her a 
new silk dress. 
Put out the light, bid her good night, it's bound to be 
right in the morning. 
If married men will out late stay, with other young men 
roam, 
They can't expect all their own way when late they do 
get home. 
Men may boast of being the host, but no man, old or 
young, 
Could e'er form a 
plan, since the world began, to stop a 
woman's tongue. 
Smooth her gently, etc. 
If we get abused for staying out late we think it is a 
shame, 
But what should we say if our wives they were to do the 
same ? 
It's natural we should be cross, we can't have our own 
way, 
So do as you'd like to be done unto, and listen to what I 
say. 
Smooth her gently, etc.

DOODLE DE Doo was a 
dandy Cock Robin, 
His tail was done up in six yards of green bobbin; 
He hadn't a

But he thought it the handsomest tail that could be. 
CHORUS.

Poor little Doodle de Doo. 
Doo-Doo he was wed to a 
little wee Wren, 
And mourned by his baby birds some eight or ten; 
But single or married, deep woe must betide 
For any one now who is stuck up with pride! 
Doodle de Doo, eta 
Doodle de Doo he jumped on a 
big rail 
In order to show off his nice little tail, 
When a 
big Thomas Cat he jumped over the wall, 
And swallowed Doo-Doo, his big tail and all!

Now all you young folks who weep and bewail, 
Mind you take warning by this little tail; 
And while you are thinking of this thing and that, 
Think of Doodle de Doo and this big Thomas Cat

NICE YOUNG GIRL FROM HARLEM. 
Written by SAN DEVE'RE. 
NOT long ago, while riding down 
In a 
car to the lower end of town, 
A 
gal got in who was dressed in brown, 
She was a 
nice young girl from Harlem. 
Her style was great—could not be beat— 
I 
winked at her, she smiled so sweet, 
I 
walked right up and took a 
seat 
By this nice young girl from Harlem. 
I 
spoke and said I 
meant no harm, 
She carried a 
book upon her arm, 
She said her farther owned a 
farm, 
This nice young girl from Harlem. 
She said she was going to meet her pa, 
Her little brother and dear mamma, 
She was " giving me taffy" and " 
This nice young girl from Harlem. 
We left the car and took a 
cruise, 
I 
swore this girl I'd never lose, 
Bought lager beer and seventeen stews 
For this nice young girl from Harlem. 
In about two hours she got her fill, 
Then asked me to loan her a 
ten-dollar bill, 
Said she'd come back—but I'm waiting gtill

STRANGERS no more forever, 
Still we as friends shall meet; 
Give back thy heart's affection--
Trustful and true and sweet. 
What is the summer's glory, 
Far from thy loving sight ? 
Now in my heart forever 
Reigneth supreme delight I 
Strangers no more forever,

Gaze in mine eyes so fondly ; 
Dearest, 0 
doubt me not! 
Strangers no more forever, 
Each loving vow renew ! 
Welcom'd as summer roses 
Welcome the diamond dew, 
Life, that was sad and lonely, 
Now is one blissful dream; 
Sunlight and joy forever 
Here in my heart shall beam. 
Strangers no more forever, 
Each bitter word forgot; 
Gaze in mine oyes so fondly; 
Dearefit, 0

'TISN'T MINE. 
PARODY ON BABY MINE-. 
Wetter, by JAMES NILES. 
Sung with great success by Is'aLze Led 
Evhasrs. 
THERE'S a 
gold watch in the window, 
'Tisn't mine, 'tisn't mine ; 
But I 
think I'll have to take it, 
It keeps time, it keeps time; 
Though if I 
should be caught, 
All my trouble will go for naught, 
To the Island I'll be brought 
Right on time, for the watch not mine, 
And on mush and milk I'll dine 
Six months at a 
time. 
T 
here's a 
horse and cutter in the streets 
'Tisn't mine, ' tisn't mine, 
But I 
am going to take it; 
For a 
pleasant time, pleasant time ; 
And if I 
don't come back, 
They can look for me with a 
hack. 
When I 
am caught they'll break my back. 
What a 
pleasant time, pleasant time, 
So I 
think I'll change my mind, 
And ride behind (
the owner). 
WHEN 'TIS MOONLIGHT. 
WALTZ SONG. 
Music published by W HITE, SMITH 41. Co., Boston, Mass: 
An, ah, ah, ah, ah, when ' Us moonlight, when 'Us star-
light, 
I 
will meet thee and I 
will bring to thee sweetest flowers, 
From the woodland, from the woodland o'er the lea; 
Ah, ye birds of spring, tell what joys ye bring, 
Merry birds, happy birds, joyous birds, birds of spring. 
Ah, when ' tis moonlight, when ' tis starlight, 
I 
will meet thee and I 
will bring to thee, 
Sweetest flowers from the woodland, 
From the woodland o'er the lea. 
Long have I 
waited here for thy coming, 
Often in doubt my poor heart sank within me; 
Hope I 
must cherish, though life may perish, 
'Tis but a 
vision of sorrow that never can be, 
'Tis but a 
vision of sorrow that never can be. 
Ah, when 'tis moonlight, when 
starlight, 
I 
will meet thee and I 
will bring to thee, 
Sweetest flowers from the woodland, 
From the woodland o'er the lea, ah, ah, ah, ah,42.

uit,N OFF THE GAS AT THE METER, 
Written and Composed byJ. STANFORD. 
WORTHY old bachelor was Peter LcLean, 
In business for several years he had been, 
In a 
shop somewhere out on the Elevated Road, 
Where the neighbors all call him a 
stingy old toad. 
His habits were frugal, he lived all alone, 
• 
Economy seem'd grafted into the bone, 
And for fear of a 
fire, ere at night he'd retire, 
He'd turn off the gas at the meter. 
CHORUS. 
He'd turn off the gas at the meter, 
He'd turn off the gas at the meter, 
Every night he would go to the regions below, 
To turn off the gas at the meter. 
Now as he grew older he took in a 
maid, 
And fifteen new greenbacks a 
year to her paid; 
She had to attend to old Peter and cook. 
And sometimes she read him the news or a 
book. 
Now McLean, who'd a 
bachelor been all his life, 
43egan to have thoughts about taking a 
wife, 
For with the old fellow she'd go down the cellar, 
To turn off the gas at the meter. 
Now he'd turn off the gas, etc. 
So useful he found his young housekeeper to be 
He soon raised her wages another new V. 
He then began spooning and telling such fibs, 
While she in return used to nudge his old ribs. 
Though sixty, 'twas plain he with Cupid was struck, 
He kissed her, and squeezed her; and called her his 
duck, 
But though his love was so hot he never forgot, 
To turn off the gas at the meter. 
Now he'd turn off the gas, etc. 
One morning they walked off to church all serene, 
And the girl after that became Mrs. McLean. 
They haven't a 
family, but he doesn't fret, 
But tells his young wife that there's time enough yet. 
They've a 
cot out of town where for light they've no 
lamp, 
But he's best pleased when living in town, the old 
scamp, 
For. he says it's a 
lark going down in the dark, 
To turn off the gas at the meter. 
Now he'd turn off the gm, etc.

WHY CAN'T I 
HAVE A BEAU?

As Snug by BERTHA For. 
I 
THINK it's very cruel— 
Now here I'm seventeen, 
And have not got a 
lover— 
A " Beau," of course, I 
mean, 
There's lots of charming fellows, 
Who smile and flirt with me; 
But mamma says, when older, 
'Tis time enough, you see I 
CHORUS. 
Why can't I 
have a 
beau ? 
I'm sure I'd like to know ! 
I'm sure it's wrong to wait so long— 
Why can't I 
have beau ? 
I 
never go to parties 
Without Papa, you know, 
Who watches me so closely— 
Oh ! ain't it awful slow ? 
He takes me home so early, 
While other girls they stay, 
And with some charming fellow 
They pass the hours away. 
Why can't I 
have a 
beau ? etc. 
If I 
should go a 
walking 
And meet some one I 
knew, 
And he should see me safely.. 
At home, then say, adieu ! 
If I 
should ask him kindly, 
A 
moment to come in, 
Papa would say, 'twas awful! 
And mamma, such a 
sin ! 
Why can't I 
have a 
beau ? etc. 
I'm growing quite discouraged, 
I 
am, upon my word; 
I 
won't be any longer 
Kept shut up like a 
bird. 
This world was made for pleasure; 
Then I 
am bound to try 
And see a 
little of it, 
That some folks would deny. 
Why can't I 
have a 
beau ? etc.

YOU WERE FALSE, 
BUT I'LL FORGIVE YOU. 
Sung with immense success by Miss GEORGIE MmazorrE, the 
Queen of Serm-Comique. 
FA.RE thee well, for once I 
loved you, 
Even more than tongue can tell, 
Little did I 
think you'd leave me, 
Now I 
bid you a 
farewell. 
You have wrecked the heart I 
cherished, 
You have doomed me day by day, 
You are false, but I'll forgive you, 
But forget you I 
never may. 
(Repeat last two lines.) 
When I 
saw your eyes in virtue, 
I 
could scarce believe my own, 
When I 
heard your voice in anger, 
It was death to every tone. 
They have told you some false stories, 
And you believed them all they say, 
You are false, but I'll forgive you, 
But forget you I 
never may. 
(Repeat last two lines.) 
One more word and all is over, 
Why are you unkind to me ? 
Tell me why you do not love me, 
Turn aside how can it be ? 
No word, not one word of pleasure, 
You believe them all they say, 
You are false, but I'll forgive you, 
But forget you I 
never may.

CEASE thy weeping, sadden'd heart, 
Brighter days are on the way, 
And the clouds so dear and dark, 
All will surely pass away. 
Flow'rs of spring will come again, 
Blooming sweetly o'er the lea, 
And the warblers of the grove 
Songs of love will chant for thee.

Broadway, 
Oh, cease thy weeping, sadden'd heart, 
Drive away all idle fears, 
Let those clouds of grief and care 
Melt away in silent tears. 
Cease thy weeping, sadden'd heart, 
Why thy face so wan and pale, 
Has thy friend in death been laid 
'Neath the grasses of the vale ? 
Ah ! there is a 
fairer land, 
Where we meet no more to part, 
Let this cheer thee, gentle one, 
Let this soothe thy sadden'd heart. 
Oh,. cease thy weeping, etc. 
Cease thy weeping, sadden'd heart. 
Has thy loved one prov'd untrue, 
Has he broken every vow 
That he promis'd only you ? 
Weep not for him, gentle maid, 
He who would both Woo and win, 
Then turi4 traitor to his word, 
Deep has drank of darker sins. 
Oh, cease thy weeping, etc.

WHEN THE TIDE COMVIS 
W ords by H. 
ASHLAND KEAN. 
Music by H. MILLARD. 
HE 
sailed away at break of day, 
The skies were blue and fair, 
He kissed his bonnie hand to me, 
With heart as light as air ; 
"Hark ye," he cried, " go watch the tide, 
As it cometh up to Lynn, 
For, foul or fair, I 
will be there 
When the flowing tide comes in 1" 
I 
watclfd the clouds that came in crowds. 
Like flocks of evil birds, 
My heart sank low with bitter woe, 
Rememb'ring Donald's words; 
" 
Oh, God !" I 
cried, and none beside 
Knew the grief my heart within, 
" 
Oh ! give me back my bonnie lad, 
None else my love can win! 
Oh ! give me back my bonnie lad, 
When the flowing tide comes in." 
THE RING NY MOTHER worak 
BY 
LOUIS DELA. 
The earth has many treasures rare, 
In gems and golden ore; 
My heart bath one more precious far. 
The ring my mother wore, 
I 
saw it first, when I, a 
child, 
Was playing by her side ; 
She told me then, ' twas father's gift, 
When she became his bride. 
I 
saw it oft in sorrow's hours, 
Which marked the after years, 
When shining on the soft, white hank 
That wiped awoy my tears, 
And oh 
saw it once again, 
When, on her dying bed, 
She lifted up her hand in prayer 
And laid it on my head. 
Beside that bed, where fell my tears, 
The ring to me was given; 
She placed it on my band, and said: 
" 
We'll meet again in heaver 1" 
I 
kissed the cheek I 
oft had pressed. 
From which the rose had fled ; 
And bowed with grief, stood motherl,s‘ 
Alone, beside the dead. 
Among the blest in realms above, 
Where sorrows are unknown, 
Oh ! may I 
meet my mother dear, 
No more to weep alone. 
Her dying words of love and faith 
Pi: cherish evermore, 
Within the heart which holds so dear, 
The rtg my mother wore.

COURTING IN THE MOONLIGHT. 
I HAVE a 
most peculiar style for passing time away, 
I 
never think of strolling out until the close of day, 
And courting is a 
pleasure that fills me with delight, 
For I 
love to take a 
ramble upon a 
moonlight night. 
CHORUS. 
Courting in the moonlight, strolling out by moonlight, 
Over the green fields and meadows so gay ; 
Courting in the moonlight, strolling out by moonlight, 
That is the happy time to pass an hour away. 
How pleasant in the summer time to take a 
country walk, 
With your arms around your fond one's waist, and have 
a 
quiet talk; 
When sweethearts get together it is a 
pretty sight, 
And hear them whisper loving words upon a 
moonlight 
night. 
Courting in the moonlight, etc. 
I 
have a 
little sweetheart, and I 
take her for a 
walk, 
I 
kiss her and caress her, and then lovingly we talk ; 
And when a 
kiss I'm stealing she says it is not right, 
But lovers do such silly things upon a 
moonlight night. 
Courting in the moonlight, etc.

THE PUMP. 
You now behold the remnants 
Of a 
blighted, sad young man, 
The victim of a 
faithless girl; 
Forcret her I

She was so fair to look at her, 
And her name was Betsy Crump, 
And the first time that I

Was down at the old town pump.

Farewell, Betsy Crump;

Right down by the old town pump, 
We used to meet down by the pump, 
And then we'd take a

She used to dress so nice and neat,

But when we'd part then my poor heart 
With agony went thump. 
And in my sleep sweet dreams I'd dream 
Of her and the old town pump.

went one night down to the pump, 
Expecting her to see, 
When a 
fellow came up like a

And roughly collared me;

The beau of Betsy Crump; 
Somehow he got me underneath,

And got three children plump,

The other just like the pump.

I 
TOOK my love one ev'ning, 
When the summer moon was beaming, 
Thro' silent arbors gleaming, 
Where Cupid has control ; 
I 
wanted to tell her 
How dearly I 
adored her, 
But oh, she would not listen, 
Tim' I 
tenderly implored her; 
Oh, love, oh, love, lay don't you heed me 1 
How can you treat me so 1 
In vain, in vain, in vain, 
Che heeded not my pain; 
She turned away her head, 
And this was all she said— 
cuonns. 
Olt, ain't you awful; 
It's wrong you know to love me so, 
Yes, you are awful ; 
Your like I 
ne'er did see ; 
Oh, ain't you awful ; 
It's wrong you know to love me so, 
Dear me, you're horrid; 
Why don't you let me be 
To make my feelings clearer, 
I 
advanced a 
little nearer, 
And said I'd like to hear her 
Say yes, and ease my mind ; 
She fumbled and mumbled, 
And laughed at my attention ; 
She said mamma would scold her, 
If such thins she dared to mention; 
" 
Come, love," I 
cried, " we'll rim away, 
And leave your mamma behind." 
" 
Oh, no, oh, no," she said, 
" 
Don't ask me now to wed; 
What would the people say 
If we should run away 1"

Pretty as a 
Picture." 
On, I 
feel so glad, I 
shall go mad, 
I 
pray you don't come near me, 
For I 
fell in love with such a 
dove, 
Of my heart she is the queen. 
As she sweetly smiled she set me wild, 
With love I 
shall go crazy ; 
For I 
scarcely knew just .what to do, 
Her smile was so serene, 
Like a 
little dove in clover, 
And before I 
knew this darling she had won me ; 
She's the fairest, she's the rarest, 
She's a 
little dove in clover over there. 
CHORUS. 
With sweet laughing eyes, like the sunrise, 
She looked so fair, bewitching, 
And the world to me now seems to be 
So full of laughing eyes. 
With this little pet I 
met 
In golden mild September, 
How my heart it beat, she looked so sweet, 
Oh, I 
never can forget; 
And so 110W you see, she's the world to me, 
Her loving smile enchains me, 
And her eyes of blue they pierce me through, 
I 
wish the time was set. 
She's a, little dove in clover, 
But will her love be true ? I 
often sit and wonder. 
She's a 
darling, she's a 
starling, 
She's a 
little dove in clover over there, 
With sweet laughing eyes, etc.

And in a 
whisper soft she laid, is this the marble arch 
CRORUS. 
Then round her lovely form I 
drew my magic circle, 
I 
pressed her, I 
caressed her, tny brain was in a 
whirl ; 
Around her lovely form I 
drew my magic circle, 
I 
kissed her and I 
called her a 
very pretty girl. 
I 
took her to a 
shady spot beneath the spreading trees, 
I 
took hold of her lily-white hand, and fell down on my knees, 
Beloved, cried I, arise, said she, and before I 
had time to speak 
She imprinted one burning kiss upon my blooming cheek. 
Then round her lovely form, etc. 
Good-night, says she, in a 
voice so sweet, and gently squeezed 
my hand, 
My knees began to knock and shake, for I 
could scarcely 
stand ; 
We'll meet again some other night, and then prepare to march, 
But where, cried I, she then replied, beneath that marble arch. 
Then round her lovely form, etc. 
However, since that fatal night, I 
have not seen my queen, 
But I've heard them say she's run away with a 
big fat horse 
marine; 
A 
ring I'll give her when we meet, but not as you suppose, 
I'll never put it on her hand, I'll stick it through her nose. 
Then round her lovely, etc.

Reverses in business brought me to a 
stand: 
I 
found very soon I 
should smash: 
My friends advised me to fly from the land, 
And seize upon all my loose cash: 
But my reputation was dearer to me 
Than all the bright gold in my till, 
So I 
paid what I 
owed and proudly I 
said, 
If I'm poor, I'm a 
gentleman still.— Cho.

One evening last week, the other end of the town, 
Whilst wandering- sadly along. 
I 
picked up a 
purse that a 
lady had dropped, 
The temptation to keep it was strong. 
!,fy pockets were empty, but firmly I 
said, 
She shall have her own come what will; 
She looked at my dress as I 
gave it and said, 
"If you're poor, you're a 
gentleman still."— Cho.

Last evening I 
rescued a 
poor homeless girl 
Whom a 
swell was insulting; I 
found 
My strength for the moment was something immense; 
As I 
hurled the "Teat brute to the ground. 
He cried out, " yoa beggar. don't meddle with me 
Or very soon you'll get a 
pill." 
But I 
said, " lay a 
hand on that girl and you'll find 
If I'm poor, I'm a 
gentleman still."—CIto.

Written and recited by LESTER H OWARD, of the " Novelty Four," 
in their original burletta, " Rehearsal in the Pallor." 
DoT vile of mine, dot vile of mine, 
She boders mine life out all der time, 
She slaps mine nose und pulls mine face, 
Und knocks mine ears all out of blace. 
She drives me of my own house out, 
Und makes me wander der night about, 
Till ven morning comes, mit a dove-like smile, 
I 
am coaxed back to my domicile 
By dot vile of mine. 
Dot vile of mine, dot vile of mine, 
Yen I

I 
sits me down in mine easy chair, 
Und eats mine Limburger und drinks mine beer, 
Veil in she comes, mit an old broom- stick, 
Und hurries me home on der double-quick, 
Vile der people all look and laugh and stare, 
Und wonders who wears der britches dere, 
Me or dot vile of mine. 
Dot vile of mine, dot vile of mine, 
She wakes me up in der midnight time, 
-Lind tells me a 
pain in her stomach she's got, 
Und vants me to make her a 
viskey hot. 
I 
goes down shtairs in my cold shirt-tail, 
Und shkins my shins on der bucket pail, 
Drying to make viskey hot in a 
coffee-
pot, 
For dot vile of mine. 
Dot vile of mine, dot vile of mine, 
Yen ever will come der happy dime, 
Yen on di.5 mortal earth her breath 
Forever shall be stopp'd mit death. 
No more, I

Der leetle shtars she make for me, 
Den I

Frotn dot voman of mine.

I 
am a

You can tell by half a 
glance; 
single man I'd Ii e 
to be, 
if I

chance. 
But %T

roan gets married, 
it's all C P with him ; 
it's the sort of thing ladies like, 
To take us fellows in. 
CHORUS. 
Theo, oh, dear, oh I

single life; 
A man he is a 
uin-coin-poop, 
That takes himself a 
wife. 
Then, oh, dear, oh, 
Be f

Let ladies try, but pipe your eye, 
When you're married, you'll find it ont 
A fellow he gets spooney 
On a 
girl that looks a 
queen, 
If he don't propose in a 
fortnight, 
She asks him what he means; 
Von mnst quickly marry me; 
She. knows her way about, 
He don't— he's green— he marries her, 
And then he finds it out. 
Then, oh, dear, oh, ko. 
He takes his love down by the sea, 
To spend 013 honey moon ; 
What should be honey, 
Always turns to cream of tartarsoon. 
It's dear, oh. (lackey 
oh, darling! 
For a 
week or thereabout ; 
And then she makes it warm for him ; 
When you're married, you'll find it out. 
Then, oh, dear, oh, &a 
He once was stout and hearty, 
hint now like mo he's thin ; 
Perhaps his wife is tolerable, 
Perhaps she's fond of gin. 
I 
won't say which, but somehow 
His money it flies about, 
Till his uncle has to help him; 
it's then he finds it out. 
Then, oh, dear, oh' eeo. 
Then in half a 
dozen years, 
Aronnd your table there ; 
You count a 
dozen boys and girls. 
All yourS—it makes you stare. 
If they ain't, you have to keep the lot, 
Perhaps you've got the gout; 
The boys won't work, the girls don't want, 
When you're married, you'll find it out.

IT 
stands in the garret, deserted and lone, 
All dingy and broken with webs overgrown ; 
The hands that once rocked it, how quiet are they, 
The smiles that beamed o'er it have faded away. 
A 
sweet angel mother once leaned o'er its side, 
And sang to her baby, her darling and pride. 
Oh, sad mem'ries gather and tears downward creep, 
That old willow cradle once rocked us to sleep. 
CHORUS. 
Ah ! 'twas rocking, still rocking at twilight's sweet fall, 
And rocking, still rocking, when night covered all ; 
A 
mother's fond prayer begg'd the angels to keep 
Sweet watch o'er the cradle that rocked us to sleep. 
A 
dear baby brother its pillow has pressed, 
While angels' sweet lullabies sang him to rest ; 
Oh, sad were the teardrops when empty it stood, 
And gone was that brother, so gentle and good, 
His wee broken playthings lay near it that day, 
'When angels had borne him so softly away ; 
Oh, long o'er thy pillow a 
mother would weep, 
Dear old willow cradle that rocked us to sleep. 
! ' twas rocking, eta. 
It stands in the garret deserted and lone, 
All dingy and broken with webs overgrown, 
And years have departed since I 
was a 
child, 
And over my pathway my loved ones have smiled. 
Yet oft in the pauses of world weary strife, 
The sweet early mem'ries will dawn on my life ; 
They bind to my heart with affection so deep, 
The old willow cradle that rock'd us to sleep. 
Ali I 'twas rocking, etc.

SOME think that life the most jolly 
Is found in a 
smoky town, 
But give me the glorious country, 
Where one can get healthy and brown. 
I 
like it now better than ever, 
I'll tell you the reason why— 
If you think I'm blind, perhaps I 
am, 
For I've got a 
sweet girl in my eye. 
CHORUS. 
Down, down by the old water mill, 
Close by the side of a 
rippling rill, 
In a 
dear little cottage just under the hill, 
There's where I 
met with my darling. 
She showed me the ducks and the drakes, 
She showed me the cocks and the hens, 
She showed me the shovels and rakes, 
And the dear little ba's in their pens. 
She showed me the birds and the bees, 
Likewise the pigs and the sows, 
She showed me the butter and cheese, 
And also the bulls and the cows. 
Down, down, etc. 
The ducks they would waddle to greet her, 
The geese made a 
terrible row, 
The cocks and the hens raced to meet her, 
And merrily grunted the sow. 
She feeds them from out of her apron, 
Her kindness to all never fails, 
Whenever she passes a 
bull or a 
cow, 
They're sure to waggle their tails. 
Down, down, 9to.

LIFE'S journey's a 
path full of briers and thorns, 
We must trudge it on foot, boys together; 
The rough and the smooth, The cahn and the storm, 
We must face it no matter the weather; 
It is folly to grieve for the joys that are past, 
Our troubles a 
lesson will give; 
So courage, my lads, with strong hearts and true, 
We will sing, " while we live, let us live."

In this world while we live, let us live, let us live,"

The miser a 
crusty old knave with his pelf, 
The rich in their carriage and four, 
Are not half as happy as you are, my friends, 
If you've got health and strength though you're poor. 
Then to grumble ',f..r,ainst fate, is a 
sin and a 
shame, 
But thank God for blessings He'll give ; 
Throw care to the winds, be staunch to the core, 
And then sing, " While we live, let us live." 
The adage, etc. 
There are those in the world that are poorer than us, 
Struggling hard with it's turmoils and strife ; 
Then hold out your hand, and help them to mount 
A round in the ladder of life. 
The mite though but small, will reap its reward, 
If you've enemies freely forgive ; 
With envy to no man, and good will to all, 
Yon can sing, " While we live, let us live."

THERE are songs unsung in ev'ry heart, 
Some beautiful memory bidden, 
That nestles alone in its resting place, 
By sorrow and tear-drops hidden, 
Some sad, sad hope that once did bloom, 
When life was gay and young, 
But now it is faded, and withered, and dead— 
Oh I 
beautiful songs unsung. 
CHORUS. 
Beautiful songs unsung, 
Sorrowful songs unsung ; 
Oh ! nestle alone in thy secret place 
Oh ! sorrowful songs unsung. 
There are songs unsung, there are tales untold, 
Whose memory never can perish, 
For the hearts that know them are hearts of gold, 
And they keep them to love and cherish. 
Tho' some are sombre and sad and drear, 
To the lives of the saddened they're clang, 
They are set in tears and never can die— 
Oh ! sorrowful songs unsung. 
Beautiful songs unsung, etc. 
There are songs unsung, there are words of love, 
That in kindness and truth were spoken, 
•But now are the links of a 
glad, wild dream, 
Cherished and loved, yet broken. 
And. oh ! to the heart that knows them so well, 
They've the sweetest of lionghts among, 
For they seem like a 
life that was kissed by death— 
Oh I

THE SONGS MY MOTHER LOVED TO SING. 
Words and Music by Gus PHILLIPS (Oefty Go?ft). 
Arranged by W. S. Muraarr, San Francisco Minstrels. 
Music published by C. H. DITSON & CO., 711 Broadway, New York. 
Price 40 cents. 
THE songs my mother loved to sing, 
Could I 
but hear them once again ; 
To childhood's memories still they cling, 
They soothed ev'ry ache and pain ; 
Ah ! how sweet they used to seem, 
flow they made my heart rejoice; 
Years, long years, seem but a 
dream, 
Still I 
bear my mother's voice. 
CHOIICS. 
Childhood's days to me so dear, 
Sweetest recollections cling ; 
How I 
often long to hear 
The songs my mother loved to sing. 
Those sweet and simple little songs, 
Songs I 
loved so well to hear ; 
How they'd heal my childish wrongs, 
How they'd seem to please and cheer. 
Songs in memory buried deep, 
Songs that oft put me to rest. 
Songs that closed my eyes in sleep, 
Lying on my mother's breast. 
Childhood's days, etc. 
Every simple little strain 
Calls to mind some happy scene, 
Brings up childhood's days again, 
Days to me yet fresh and green. 
Better far than glittering gold, 
Greater far than crown of king, 
Dearer far than wealth untold, 
The songs my mother loved to sing. 
Childhood's days, etc.

A TRAMP. 
A RECITATION. 
As recited by CHARLES BURKE, of CAIIPBELL & BURKE, with 
great success. 
LEMME sit down a 
minute, a 
stone's got in my shoe ; 
Don't you commence your cussin', I 
ain't done nothin' to 
you. 
Yes, I'm a 
tramp. 
What of it ? 
Folks say we ain't no 
good, 
But tramps has to live, I 
reckon, though folks don't think 
we should. 
Once I 
was strong and handsome, had plenty of cash and 
clothes ; 
That was afore I 
tippled and gin got into my nose. 
Down in Lehigh Valley me and people grew, 
I 
was a 
blacksmith, cap'en—yes, and a 
good one, too ; 
Me and my wife and Nellie—Nellie was just sixteen, 
She was the pootiest creature the Valley had ever seen. 
Beaux ? Why, she had a 
dozen—had 'em from near and 
fur, 
But they were mostly farmers, none of ' em suited her. 
There was a 
city stranger, young, handsome and tall, 
Damn him—I 
wish I 
had him strangled agin that wall. 
He was the man for Nellie— she didn't know no ill ; 
Mother she tried to stop it, but you know a 
young gal's 
will. 
Well, it's the same old story—common enough, you'll 
say, 
He was a 
soft-tongued devil, and got her to run away. 
More than a 
month after we heard from the poor young 
thing, 
He'd gone away and left her without a 
wedding ring. 
Back to her home we brought her, back to her mother's 
side, 
Fill'd with a 
raging fever—she fell at my feet and died. 
Frantic with shame and trouble, her mother began to 
sink, 
Dead—in less than a 
fortnight— that's when I 
took to 
drink. 
Gimme one glass, Curnel, and then I'll be on my way, 
I'll tramp till I find that scoundrel, if it takes till the 
Judgment Day.

OH 
let not this thought for 
moment possess you, 
That if you have wealth all your cares would be o'er ; 
Believe me, you'd often find much to distress you, 
The rich have their troubles as well as the poor. 
How many there are who would part with their treasure, 
Could they but obtain a 
few moments' repose., 
But ah ! they, alas ! are denied the sweet pleasure, 
While fled from each cheek is the hue of the rose. 
moobssoilitao..,tAL.-.4.   
CHORUS. 
Then let not this thought for a 
moment possess you. 
That if you had wealth all your cares would be o'er; 
Believe me, you'd often find much to distress you, 
The rich have their troubles as well as the poor. 
Behold that young man, from his home just departed, 
In foolish extravagance wasting his all, 
And then turn your eyes to his friends, broken-hearted, 
Whose sorrowful tale would yoiu• spirit appal. 
Go wander awhile where the cypress is bending, 
And see the grand lady with heart sad and sore, 
While fast from her eyes are the tear-drops descending, 
The rich have their troubles as well as the poor. 
Then let not this, etc. 
The miser at night with his bags full of treasure, 
Oh ! think you he's happy when counting them o'er ? 
A 
mere puff of wind very soon mars his pleasure, 
He fancies a 
robber is forcing his door. 
Then while you have health and your kindred are near 
you, 
In heart be contented and ask nothing more; 
If a 
million you had, still you'd need more to cheer you, 
The rich have their troubles as well as the poor. 
Then let not this, etc.

THAT'S HOW YOU GET SERVED WHEN 
YOU'RE OLD. 
W ritten and composed by JOHN READ. 
Sung by DAN NASA. 
Music of this song is published by E. H. HARDING, 229 Bowery, 
New York. 
Price 10 cents. 
ONE day in the street, I 
just happen'd to meet 
An old friend whom I'd not seen for years, 
The old man looked sad, tho' to meet me was glad, 
And his eyes as we spoke fill'd with tears. 
I 
said, " John, be brief, what's the cause of your grief ? 
To me your misfortunes unfold." 
Said he, " In poor me, you a 
sample may see 
Of how a 
man's served when he's 
CHORUS. 
"Each day growing older, I 
get the cold shoulder, 
By youngsters thrust out in the cold, 
Who jeeringly say that I'm in the way, 
That's how you get served when you're old. 
"I began as a 
lad, and a 
hard place I 
had, 
Which I 
held for some forty-five years ; 
I've worked like a 
slave, yet no money could save, 
And now I 
may starve it appears. 
What I've had to endure is hard I 
am sure, 
Now by the young master I'm told 
I 
must no longer stay, but for others make way, 
That's how you get served when you're old. 
Each day growing, etc. 
"When young I 
was praised and my wages were raised 
No labor I'd ever then shirk, 
And master would then point me out to the men 
As the one who best stuck to his work. 
Now I'm feeble and weak, he'll to me hardly speak, 
-Unless it's to grumble or scold; 
They simply make fan of what I 
have done, 
That's how you get served when you're old. 
Each clay growing, etc. 
" 
My wifr, poor soul I 
she is near seventy-three, 
flow to' keep her from want I 
don't know, 
If I 
beg I 
intrude, by p'iice am pursued, 
And if to the work-house we go 
To seek for relief, they but add to our grief, 
' 
You must come in the house,' we are told. 
Part husband from wife to be paupers for life, 
That's how you get served when you're old." 
Each day growing, etc. 
THE LITTLE OLD HOUSE ON THE RHINE. 
By ALEX MCCLAFFERTy. 
Sung by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
AIR.—" The Old Brown Cot on the Hill." 
I 
nruzmnEn the days that are now past and gone, 
When a 
child how I 
once loved to play, 
By the side of the mill that stands close by the stream, 
Where for pleasure I 
often would stray. 
But now I've grown old and quite feeble you see, 
And so has my poor Katherine, 
But I 
sigh when I 
think of my once happy days, 
In that little old house on the Rhine. 
It was lonely and cold, and in winter 'twas drear, 
For the wind would assail it at times, 
Still there's no place on earth to my memory more 
dear, 
Than that little old house on the Rhine. 
Now the old school house stands just the same as be-
fore, 
With the church and its spires so grand, 
Where fond stories of love to each other we'd tell, 
As together we'd walk hand in hand. 
It was there where the old folks for pleasure would stay, 
And bask 'neath the old shady vine, 
How they'd watch us at play when from school we'd 
return, 
To that little old house on the Rhine. 
It was lonely, etc. 
They are both dead and gone, and they sleep side by 
side, 
In the grave by the end of the vale. 
'Where the birds sweetly sing on a 
bright summer's eve, 
And play in the moonlight so pale. 
Good-bye, dear old home, fare you well for awhile, 
You've sheltered me many a 
time. 
Oh ! I'd love to return to my old fatherland, 
And that little old house on the Rhine. 
It was lonely, etc.

WHEN WE LOVED IN THE SWEET LONG

Viroids by HARRY BURNS.

BASLER. 
All Rights Reserved. 
I 
REMEMBER one eve when you sat by my side, 
Your face then was handsome and fair, 
asked you, then, darling, if you'd be ray bride, 
While I 
toyed with your bonnie brown hair. 
I 
saw the sweet answering look that you gave, 
With true love expressed in your eye, 
Your answer was low like the wind's gentle wave, 
But my heart scarcely needed reply. 
CHORUS. 
Your answer then, darling, was music to me, 
It came so enchanting and low, 
Your sweetly whispered yes, to my heart still 
replies, 
As it did on that eve long ago. 
Your sweet whispered yes, to my heart still 
replies, 
As it did on that eve long ago. 
Our hearts are the same, tho' the years have gone by 
Great trials we both have pass'd through, 
Together we'll cling and together we'll die, 
With our love never fading and true. 
We've lived thro' our pleasures, we've lived thro' 
our pain, 
For life has its ebb and its flow, 
We seem to be living those days o'er again, 
When we loved in the sweet long ago. 
Your answer then, etc.

Price 10 cents. 
THERE'S a 
girl of high degree upon whom I 
am awfully 
stuck, 
She dances in the ballet, while her father drives a 
truck; 
Her mother she peddles lemonade, her brother he slings 
bash, 
Yet the neighbors say most every day, Jahanna's on the 
mash. 
CHORUS. 
Johanna Louisa McGuire 
Is a 
girl that you all could admire. 
She's a 
voice like a 
bell, 
Though I 
never could tell 
Where she got it or how, 
Yet you all do allow 
That Johanna Louisa McGuire 
Has sorriething that you all would desire, 
For she's awfully gay on St. Patrick's day, 
Is Johanna Louisa McGuire. 
She inhabits a 
little sky parlor up an alley where every-
thing's snug, 
Her furniture's very antique, a 
table, three chairs and a 
jug. 
I 
one evening at the window sat as her invited guest, 
From the alley below some young devil did throw a 
cud 
of Jackson's best. 
SPOKEN.—It struck the girl bang in the eye, the old 
yellow Jack molasses tobacco. 
I 
was about to sympathize 
with her, when one of those young devils yelled—

YOU GIT 
As sung by CammEs and LEWIS DOCKSTADEIL 
SHE was very smart an' she owned a 
cart, 
Her maiden name was Pat; 
'Deed, she owned a 
mule au' she went to school, 
She was dumpy, short an' fat. 
Oh, her given name was Jane, 
it was a 
shame, but she was lame, 
She was a 
brakeman on a 
cattle train, 
And her parents all lived in Fort Wayne. 
Oh, I 
asked her for a 
kiss, a 
little kiss, 
And she told me this : 
She whispered like an angel, " You travel— 
No w—umph—phist—you git !" 
Oh ! I 
won her heart, we sold de cart, 
An' we gave away de mule ; 
Well, she hemmed and hawed, she cried an' jawed, 
And she said I 
was a 
fool; 
She owned a 
dog that was full of fleas, 
An' on my knees I 
used to tease. 
Seven long years I 
coaxed her to marry, 
But I 
ne'er could her please. 
She would laugh, but she wouldn't cry, 
Wish I 
may die ! well, I 
wouldn't lie— 
Oh I 
she whispered, " Skip the gutter, young fellow I 
Now—umph—phist—you git !"

THE stars were twinkling o'er the lake, 
One lovely summer night ; 
I 
heard the wavelets gently break 
In music sweet and light. 
But fairer than each silver star, 
The eyes that sought my own ! 
Oh, meeting there was sweeter far, 
Than rowing all alone ! 
CHORUS. 
Dip, dip, our oars we bent amid the spray so bright ; 
O'er the tide how sweet to glide rowing in the starligh 
Dip, dip, our oars we bent amid the spray so bright, 
Keeping time to music's chime rowing in the starlight 
'Twas like a 
lovely fairy dream ; 
We fondly lingered there ; 
Until that hour I 
did not deem, 
That earth held scenes so fair. 
The stars were watching us we knew, 
But would never tell ; 
Sweet words were spoken kind and true, 
By lips I 
loved so well! 
Dip, dip, etc. 
The night was fading fast away, 
The parting hour drew near; 
How sweet could we forever stay, 
'Mid scenes so bright and dear ! 
But, oh, my heart shall never tell, 
What loving lips replied, 
When asked that we thro' life might sail, 
Forever side by side!
