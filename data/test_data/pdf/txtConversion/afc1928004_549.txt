WHICH ROAD IS YOU GWINE TO TAKE? 
What kind of garments does de wise men wear, 
To jine de pilgrim band; 
What kind of hair-ile for to grease your hair, 
And jine de pilgrim band. 
You must wear a 
long white ulster, 
Floating on de morning breeze, 
And shake de gospel powder, 
To make ole Satan sneeze. 
Dar's one road leads to de promised land, 
And de odder to de brimstone lake, 
Don't stan' all day a 
making up your mind 
Which road is you gwine to take? 
CHORUS. 
Walk on, don't wait for stragglers by de way, 
For I'm gwine through on de telegraph route, 
To get ready for de judgment day. 
Dar's no use trying for to weep and say, 
jine de pilgrim band; 
I 
didn't have a 
light and I 
lost my way, 
jine de pilgrim band. 
'Twill be worse than yellow jandis, 
When dey frow you in de flame, 
And it's no use giving " taffy," 
Dey'll block your little game. 
Dar's one road leads to de promised land, 
And de odder to de brimstone lake, 
Don't stall' all day a

When Satan goes round to collect de fares,

If your pass-word ain't de right one, 
And your name ain't on de book, 
It will be too late to buzz him,

You'll find dat you are shook. 
Dar's one road leads to de promised land, 
And de odder to de brimstone lake, 
Don't stan' all day a

DOWN BY THE BROOK. 
It was down by the brook in the meadow, 
Where the daisies and buttercups grow, 
And the wild-flowers glistened so brightly, 
When kissed by the new-fallen dew, 
Where the sound of the rippling brooklet, 
As it merrily danced on its way, 
A song of joyful welcome sang, 
To me, one bright Summer's day. 
CHORUS. 
It was down by the brook in the meadow, 
Where the daisies and buttercups grow, 
And the wild-flowers bloom so brightly, 
When kissed by the new-fallen dew. 
It was down by the brook in the meadow, 
One morn when the sun shone serene, 
I 
lay on the green and mossy banks, 
Indulging in youth's summer dream, 
I 
dreamt of the days that are all gone, 
Those many sweet (lays of the past, 
I 
wondered if life would be always gay, 
And Summer forever could last.—CHORITS. 
It was down by the brook in the meadow, 
That an old man so feeble and gray, 
With bended bead he pass'd along, 
And thus to himself he did say,— 
"Oh! for those days that are faded, 
Those many sweet days of the past, 
But alas! I 
have found in my walks thro' life, 
That Summer forever won't last."—Cnonus. 
DARLING SWEET EYES. 
Darling Sweet Eyes, are you watching, 
By the oak tree down the lane, 
Are you waiting for my coming 
To your sunny face again? 
Do you listen for my footstep, 
Down the old path drawing nigh, 
Are you wondering why I 
linger, 
As the moments wander by? 
REFRAIN. 
Darling Sweet Eyes, I 
am coming 
To thy sunny face again. 
CHORUS. 
Darling Sweet Eyes, are you watching, 
Are you waiting down the lane, 
Don't be sighing, I 
am coining 
To thy sunny face again. 
Darling Sweet Eyes, are you watching 
in the gleam of sunset's bars, 
That must fade and leave you only 
Trembling shadows of the stars? 
Has your little heart grown weary 
That no tone of mine is heard, 
Breathing to you love's sweet story, 
'Neath the nest of sleeping bird? 
REFRAIN—Darling Sweet Eyes, I 
am coming, &c. 
CnoRus—Darling Sweet Eyes, are you watching, &c. 
Darling Sweet Eyes, are you watching 
As you ha7e so oft before, 
Are you keeping all the kisses 
For my loving lips once more? 
I'll be true unto the promise 
Whispered yestereve to thee, 
You shall greet me with caresses, 
Though so late our meeting be. 
REFRAIN—Darling Sweet Eyes, I 
am coming, &c. 
CiioRus—Darling Sweet Eyes, are you watching, &c.

Oh, the darkies all will have a .jubilee, 
Such a 
gathering there never was before, 
Oh, how happy ev'ry one will be, 
As we dance upon the kitchen floor. 
There'll be walking for the cake, all the ladies' hearts 
we'll break, 
When we all commence to do the promenade, 
Betsey Brown and Julia Lee will pass the coffee and the 
tea, 
Down to the darkies' jubilee. 
CHORUS. 
Tell the children all to come, 
Black-eyed Sue and Hannah Gum, 
Music ringing, darkies singing, 
Ey'ry one agree, 
Grease the floor and close the window, 
Don't forget to tell Malinda 
That we all are getting ready for the jubilee. 
All the ladies will be dressed so very neat, 
Ev'rybody will look very nice and clean, 
When we darkies promenade the street, 
Ev'ry thing will be just like a 
dream. 
fhere is dandy Dick and Pete, they will exercise theit 
feet, 
And the yaller gals will do the same, you see, 
We will dance until the morn just as sure as you are born, 
Down to the darkies' jubilee. 
Citottus—Tell the children all to come, 8,7,c. 
BE SURE YOU NEVER TELL. 
Pray pardon me, my fairy sweet, 
I 
hope I 
don't intrude? 
'Tis all by chance, you know, we meet, 
Now do not think me rude. 
Oh, pardon, sir, I 
freely give, 
By chance I 
came here too, 
Where pretty birds and flow'rets live, 
And skies are sunny blue. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, rambling in the rosy air, 
Agrees with me so well, 
But what we whisper softly there, 
Be sure you never tell. 
It happened, as I 
said, by chance, 
I 
strolled along this way, 
Quite fascinated by your glance 
And smile so bright and gay. 
You men are such deceivers e'er, 
There's danger in your smile; 
You call a 
maiden sweet and fair, 
Don't mean it all the while. 
CHORUS—Oh, rambling in the rosy air, &c. 
My heart I 
fondly give to you: 
Oh, give me then your own I 
I'll ever be so kind and true, 
And live for you alone! 
Your words they have surprised me so, 
My answer you must guess, 
But as I 
cannot whisper " No," 
Of course, I 
must say "Yes!" 
MORA MARIE. 
Just over your snow-white face, 
Mora Marie, Mora Marie, 
One little flower I 
place, 
Kindly for thee; 
Here 'neath the grass and dew, 
Surely 'twill breathe to you 
That still my heart is true, 
Mora Marie, Mora Marie. 
CHORUS. 
Mora Marie, Mora Marie, 
Come back, colleen, to me, 
How can I 
live from thee, 
No more thy face to see, 
Mora Marie, Mora Marie. 
Oh, why did you leave me here, 
Mora Marie, Mora Marie, 
Longing to have you near, 
Darling to me; 
Oh how my heart doth miss 
Sweet words of thine and kiss, 
Now but a 
dream of bliss, 
Mora Marie, Mora Marie. 
CHORUS—Mora Marie, Mora Marie, & e. 
Would you might wake from sleep, 
Mora Marie, Mora Marie, 
And to my bosom creep, 
Smiling on me; 
But it is vain to sigh, 
Since lost to me you lie, 
So then, a 
sweet good-by, 
Mora Marie, Mora Marie. 
CHORUS—Mora Marie, Mora Marie, &e.

THE MAGNOLIA OF TENNESSEE. 
On the Mississippi River, in the State of Tennessee, 
Where the magnolia fragrance you inhale, 
Where the steamboats are a 
screaming, and the darkies 
am a 
singing, 
As they roll on board the old cotton bale. 
Ev'rything was bright and glorious in dat dear sunny land, 
Where I 
used to hoe amongst the sugar-cane, 
Old Tennessee's had trouble with pestilence and flood, 
Still the magnolia blooms just the same. 
CHORUS. 
The Magnolia, the Magnolia, 
The Magnolia of old Tennessee, 
The Magnolia, the Magnolia, 
The Magnolia of old Tennessee. 
Old massa used to tell us dat dis world goes round and 
round, 
And many changes happen in one year, 
We can tell how ' tis at present, but we know not what we 
may be, 
And Emancipation Day was mighty near. 
Yet brave old Tennessee with her magnolia groves, 
Her cotton, her tobacco, and her corn, 
Stood as haughty as a 
peacock, for dat am the state, 
Where old General Hickory Jackson was born. 
CHORUS.—The Magnolia, the Magnolia, &c.

PARTED FROM LOVED ONES. 
Parted from loved ones, in sadness I 
roam, 
Far from the bright sunny faces at home; 
Parted from all who are dear unto me, 
Strange faces only around me I 
see. 
Strange voices greet me, and sunshine no more 
Sheds a 
bright ray o'er my path as of yore; 
Far from the scenes of my boyhood I 
roam, 
Parted from loved ones, the loved ones at home. 
Parted from loved ones altho' I 
may be, 
Soon I 
expect their bright faces to see; 
Never again from the circle to roam, 
Parted from loved ones, the loved ones at home. 
Parted from loved ones, but mem'ry holds fast, 
And cherishes fondly the scenes of the past; 
Scenes of affection, bright visions of joy, 
That long years of absence can never destroy. 
The bright hopes of boyhood may fade and depart, 
But home-love still lingers and lives in the heart, 
And brightens our pathway where'er we may roam, 
Parted from loved ones, the loved ones at home. 
CHORUS—Parted from loved ones altho' I 
may be, & c. 
Parted from loved ones, but still I 
am not, 
Tho' wand'ring afar, by the loved ones forgot; 
Still, still Fin remembered, where'er I 
may be, 
The flowers of affection are blooming for me, 
And watered by tears of regret for my stay, 
Will bloom on in beauty and brighten my way, 
As far from the pleasant home eiTele I 
roam, 
Parted from loved ones, the loved ones at home.

My heart's turned back to Dixie, 
And I 
must go. 
I've hoed in fields of cotton, 
I've worked upon the river, 
I 
used to think if I 
got off, 
I'd go back there, no, never. 
But time has changed the old man, 
his head is bending low, 
His heart's turned back to Dixie, 
And he must go. 
CHORUS—I'se gwine back to Dixie, &c. 
I'm travelling back to Dixie, 
My step is slow and feeble, 
I

And lead me from all evil, 
And should my friends foesake me, 
Then kind friends come and take me, 
My heart's turned back to Dixie, 
And I 
must go. 
CHORUS—I'se gwine back to Dixie, Scc.

FATHER'S GROWING OLD . 
Father's growing old now, his limbs are weak and sore, 
And mamma 
has to guide him as he walks across the floor; 
He says his days are numbered, and he soon from us will 
part, 
Then what will good, kind mamma do, I 
know ' twill 
break her heart; 
He says he saw the angels, and they whispered- soft and 
low, 
They told him they were waiting, and he soon with them 
would go; 
They sang their plaintive carol, it filled him with delight, 
Then slowly from him faded, bidding papa sweet good-
night. 
CHORUS. 
Close the door softly, mamma, don't weep, 
Papa is dreaming, so lay down to sleep; 
Dreaming of forms that are purest and bright, 
Angels will guard and protect him to-night. 
Morning dawned with splendor, the sun shone clear and 
bright, 
The flowers seemed to sparkle in the pretty golden light; 
And way down in the meadow where the grass was tall 
and green, 
The lambs would frolic merrily beside the flowing stream; 
But papa could not see them, for his spirit took its flight, 
The angels beckoned for him, and with them he went at 
night; 
He called me to his bedside before his soul had flown, 
And told me he was going to that bright, celestial home. 
CH0Rus—Close the door softly, mamma, don't weep, &c.

SCOTCH LASSIE, JEAN. 
In Scotland's fair lands over mountains and rills, 
That's where I

day 
In looking at the lads and lassies on the green, 
in the fair old land of Scotland, far away. 
I 
have waitedfor her coming, but she has not come as yet, 
The truth seems to dawn upon me plain; 
They say she is false, but I 
still believe her true, 
She's my darling blue-eyed Scotch Lassie, Jean. 
CHORUS. 
0 Jean, my bonnie Jean, come to your laddie once again! 
They say that you are false, but I 
still believe you mine, 
You are my bonnie blue-eyed Scotch Lassie, Jean. 
She said she would meet me, but I've waited long in vain, 
In lands far away she does roam ; 
Her promise she will keep, oh! break it not, my Jean! 
'We'll be happy in our bonnie little home. 
0 then, let me not long wait ! let me meet thee soon, my 
Jean, 
And the heavens will smile on our love; 
And when life is dead we will leave this earthly scene, 
And our hearts will dwell in joy and bliss above. 
CHORUS-0 
Jean, my bonnie Jean, come to your lad-
die once again, etc.

ALL DE DARKIES GITTIN' UP. 
We are a

And we am gone astray, 
We're sailin' on de sea oh sin,

Say, don't you trust to luck.

And when were in de cornfield, 
He whips us all on Monday. 
Cuouts—Oh yes! he did; oh yes! he did; 
Now we are bound for glory, 
We'll watch de golden gate, 
And when we see old massa dar,

But now we're on de track, 
Ole Satan's lost his reck'nin', 
We're nebber guin' back.

You see before you now a 
peculiar sort of nig, 
Her name it is Aunt Chloe, 
For dancing in the ballet, or shuffling in the jig, 
That's where I'm in my glory, 
But when I

Oh! happy was I 
then, 
I 
had a 
good old massa, 
And he was the best of men. 
CHORUS. 
Poor Aunt Chloe, 
Poor Aunt Chloe, 
Nobody cares for me, 
Poor Aunt Chloe, 
Poor Aunt Chloe, 
Born way down in Florida. 
When I 
used to pick de cotton so early in de morn, 
Way down on the old plantation, 
One day we got de news from Massa Abraham, 
All about tne nigger's Emancipation, 
My old man he did run away, 
And left me all alone, 
So now there's nobody who cares for me, 
As through this world I 
roam. 
CHORUS—Poor Aunt Chloe, & c.

GIVE EVERY MAN A SQUARE DEAL. 
The children of labor are rising in might 
To-day o'er our beautiful land, 
They ask but equality, justice and right. 
For these they will fight hand in hand. - 
The yoke of oppression for years they have worn : 
But now into line as they wheel, 
Oh, this is their motto, triumphantly borne— 
Give every man a 
square deal. 
CHORUS. 
Then give every man a 
square deal; 
Why should we beg or yet steal? 
For this is our cry, we will conquer or die. 
Then give every man a 
square deal. 
The working-man asks as reward for his toil 
A fairer division of gain, 
He will not be robbed. thou Ldi a 
son of the soil, 
his rirlits he will dare to maintain. 
Should capital strive to crush labor to-
day. 
By tread of its harsh iron heel, 
The worm that is trod on, will turn while it may— 
Give every man a 
square deal. 
Chorus— Then give every man a 
square deal, etc. 
The time it has come for the freeman at last 
To strike that his wron ,
-s be made right, 
his foes must o 
down like a 
reed by the blast, 
For his be the conqueror's ini:_!itt. 
Then rouse every laborer, toiler and all! 
No longer your purpose conceal: 
Why need you be slaves? rally then with this call— 
Give every man a 
square deal. 
Chorus—Then give every man a 
square deal, etc.

GOOD-BY, OLD SUIVANEE RIVER. 
Oh, when I 
think of happy days gone by, 
iri 
weary heart begins to quiver, 
The good old times when I 
was young and gay. 
When sailing on the Suwanee 
I've travelled up and down its mossy banks, 
And sailed its crystal waters o'er; 
I 
used to sing the good old darkey songs, 
in happy days of yore. 
CHORUS. 
Good-by, good-by, old Suwanee River, 
I 
fills my weary heart with pain, 
And de tears roll down my poor ole wrinkled face, 
When I 
think Cli ne'er return again. 
I 
think how once I 
labored hoeing corn, 
And in the good old fiehls of cotton; 
Though many years since then have rolled away, 
I 
never have that tune forgotten. 
The tears steal slowly down my wrinkled face, 
And fall upon the barren floor; 
When thinking. of the good old tunes gone by. 
in happy days of yore. 
CnontIs—Good-by, good-by, old Suwanee River, &c. 
I'm growing bent and feeble ev'ry day, 
And soon shall leave this home forever; 
To join in heart and hand my dear old wife, 
Where souls of peace and love ne'er sever.. 
The darkies all will mnis my cheerful face, 
When knocking at my cottage door; 
Where many good old times they used to have, 
In the happy days of yore. 
CHORUS—Good- by, good-by, old Suwanee River. Sze

Open up dem doors, 
Open up dem doors, 
Fling dem doors wide open, 
For I 
want to get a 
glimpse inside. 
Dat tear turned to a 
ribber, 
Down de mountain flowing, 
I'se gwine to build a 
raft. 
On to Jordan I 
am going, 
So from de cloud I 
will make a 
boat, 
And down de stream I 
is gwan to float, 
De silver quill I'll take for a

I'll blow my horn wid a 
Gabriel blast, 
Den I'll done go butcher my fattest calf, 
And I'll send to de Ruler a 
quick tele-

CHORUS—Open up dem -doors, ,tc. 
THOUGH RICH, I'M NO BETTER THAN YOU. 
What care I 
to-day for the world and its way? 
I 
can smile when the poor they do frown ; 
Tito' rich I 
have grown, there's no one can say, 
The poor man I 
ever put down. 
I 
help him along when I 
tind him in need, 
What more would you ask me to do? 
But it's this that I 
want to impress on your minds, 
Tho' rich, I'm no better than you. 
CHORUS. 
Tito' you see me to-day in this costly array, 
Who knows what I 
may yet go through ; 
So you'll lind just as far as equality goes, 
Tho' rich, I'm no better than you. 
Last night in the street a 
poor man I 
did meet, 
Who asked me if aid I 
would give ; 
I 
extended my hand at the poor man's demand, 
Yes, says I, my dear friend, you must live. 
I 
gave him assistance, he thanked me, and said, 
it's hard, sir, but what can I 
do? 
Says 1. my dear friend, let that be as it may, 
Tho' rich, I'm no better than you. 
CHORUS—Though you see me to-day in this costly 
array, etc. 
In conclusion I'd state, tho' your lot may be great, 
Don't think yourself better than all ; 
But bear this in mind, for it's truth you will find, 
The greatest of men they did fall. 
Tho' the poor man may want, and the rich man may 
have, 
There's one thing I 
know to be true, 
Let death come a-knocking at either man's door, 
Tito' rich, I'm no better than you. 
Cnonus—Though you see me to-day in this costly 
array, etc.

There's many moments I 
have seen, 
That tut hour seemed to me, 
When I 
was in de cotton fields, 
Before dey set me free, 
But months scented just as short as days, 
When I 
was Chloe's bean, 
When in de cabin oft we met, 
In times of long ago. 
CHORES. 
But now my form is wasted, 
My cheeks have ceased to glow, 
I 
look with pleasure back upon 
The times of long ago. 
How oft we sat on cotton bales, 
And such pretty songs she sung, 
It makes me feel so , rood to think 
Of times when we were young. 
I'd welcome back dose slabery days. 
I'd bear de whip and chain, 
And be a 
willing slabe to hab 
My Chloe come back again. 
CHORUS—Thlt now my form is wasted, &-,

Sung with great success by TOM McINTOSH. 
I 
DON'T LIKE A CUR AT MY HEELS. 
I 
like honest pluck in this warfare of life, 
No matter whoever I 
meet, 
I 
like a 
man boldly to say what he thinks, 
And not till me with hollow deceit, 
It may not be pleasant.at all times to hear 
The truth plainly told in your ear ; 
Yet ' tis better to know you're prepar'd for the 
worst, 
Than tremble like children with fear. 
CHORUS. 
I 
do like a 
man that 
vill boldly stand up, 
And tell me at once what he feels. 
I 
can 11;fht with the lion that roars in my face, 
But I 
don't like a 
cur at my heels. 
I 
like to be told of my faults like a 
man, 
And I 
ne'er knew a 
man who had none, 
hard words may be used, but I 
like hint the most 
Who has pluck all my faults to make known, 
If wrong, I 
can cure the foul slander at once, 
Ana destroy every venomous part ; 
Yet 1 
reel when a 
Judas who smiles in my face, 
Gives a 
stab at my back in the dark. 
Ctiouus—I 
do like a 
man that will boldly stand up, etc. 
So behind a 
man's back always mind what you say, 
If you can't do him good, do no hartn, 
if you don't like back-biting, don't do it yourself, 
And your good name will spread like a 
charm. 
W e 
all have to live, so let's, try and make life 
A fair open field for the race ; 
And if you have cause of complaint 'gainst a 
man, 
Go tell him right straight to his face. 
CHORUS—I 
do like a 
man that will boldly stand up, etc.

SEND THE BOY HOME, SUSAN. 
I 
took my girl one morn, 
To walk upon the lawn, 
And Susan was the lovely beauty's name. 
But ere we,left the path, 
Her mann appeared in wrath, 
And to the girl she did at once exclaim.

Hold, Susan! hold, Susan! 
The ground is all damp, 
And you've got your best shoes on, 
hold, Susan ! hold, Susan! 
Send that boy home, 
And come into the house. 
I 
turned round at the gate, 
I 
did expostulate 
And said the darling surely'd get no harm 
But she would take no stock 
In me or in my talk, 
But shouted to the dear one on my arm. 
Cnoitus—Irold, Susan! hold, Susan! &c. 
I 
said no boy was I 
And for Susan I 
would die, 
But that would not subdue the old lady's wrath, 
A - 
And hoped I'd soon be dead, 
And, broom hi hand, came raging down the path. 
CHORUS—Hold, Susan! hold, Susan! & c. 
I 
fled in great alarm, 
But soon my fears did calm, 
I 
said the sea has good fish, many more, 
But now it often seems, 
Awake or in my dreams, 
I 
hear that woman calling from the door.

IT PONT' BELONG TO ME. 
When I 
was but a 
little boy, I 
used to go to school, 
There I 
was so very good some said I 
was a 
fool; 
But yet I 
never claimed a 
thing that didn't belong to me, 
I 
always was as honest, and as truthful as could be. 
The other day,_ as I 
walked out, by a 
policeman I 
was 
stopped, 
lie said, " Young man, this purse of gold from your 
pocket dropped," 
But as I 
never carried one and had but little coin, 
As an honest boy I 
did reply, the purse it is not mine.

It don't belong to me, It don't belong to me 
I 
always was an honest boy, as truthful as could be 
And never yet have claimed a 
thing that didn't belong to me 
For I 
was always honest, and as truthful as could be. 
My wages being very small, I 
live in humble style, 
But with the girls I " Lardy dah" among time great and fine; 
I 
tell them almost everything, for I'ye got lots of cheek, 
But little they know I 
do the swell uncut live dollars a 
week. 
The other day I 
bought a 
herring, I 
placed it in my hat, 
I 
saw a 
lady come down the street, I 
knew she'd stop 
to chat; 
My hat blew off, the herring fell out, the street boys 
laughed with glee, 
But when they brought it back I said, " It don't be-
long' to Ille." —CHORUS.

Whenever I

Or do a

The other night when I

The landlord rushing after me says, " Dan, what does 
this mean? 
Miss Brown has gone and left behind that infant as you

Says I,'Tis quite surprising, but it don't belong to me. CI10.
