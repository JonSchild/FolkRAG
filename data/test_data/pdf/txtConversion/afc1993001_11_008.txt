The fieldwork began on Tuesday, April 27,  1982 and ended on Sunday,
 
June 27, 1982 with subsequent visits in July to document the Obon Festival,
 
a major Japanese Buddhist festival.
 The fieldwork included twelve visits
 
to -
 the church  and two visits to people's homes for interviews.
 A serie��
 
of appendices follows the report and highlights some of the information
 
included in the report.
 
In 1975,  the Buddhist Churches of America published a 467 page
 
history of its organization and the many members.
 The book does not
 
have a Library of Congress catalogue number so I have preceeded the report
 
with a copy of the printed history of the Senshin Buddhist Church. 
I
 
feel that their accounting of their history , because it is based on
 
years of research, will be most accurate and appropriate to include.

aneto—chairman,
 
THE SENSHIN GAUKIN
 
Currently,  the Senshin Gakuin teaches the Japanese language to about
 
twenty-five students aged five through sixteen.
 There are only two teachers
 
now,  Sumiko Ono who teaches grades one, two and three, and Henry Inouye
 
who teaches the upper level students.
 In the past, enrollment ran as high
 
as 150.
 However, most of the Japanese and Japanese-americans who lived in
 
the area have moved away in the past ten years.
 They still return to the
 
church for service on Sundays but prefer to send their children to a
 
language school closer to home.
 The Gardenia Japanese Language School has
 
about 600 students including family's who are soon to be transferred to
 
Japan for employment and need to learn the language.
 There are also
 
language schools in West Los Angeles, Orange County and the San Fernando
 
Valley.
 This indicates that the interest is still high.
 The Senshin
 
Gakuin seems to be suffering from the fact that the neighborhood has changed
 
from Japanese to Black over the past ten years causing a decrease in
 
enrollment.
 In fact, the school has considered folding twice but the
 
members keep it alive.
 
Because the Senshin Gakuin is an educational program of the Senshin
 
Buddhist Church,  it does not pay rent or overhead.
 The church, which is
 
entirely supported by its members, donates the space to the Gakuin.
 The
 
students do pay a monthly fee of $12.00 which covers the books and the
 
honorarium paid to the teachers.
 Ms. Ono receives $110.00 monthly and
 
Mr.  Inouye receives $135.00 monthly.
 Mr.  Inouye explained that if they
 
do run into extra expenses,  the Church covers them.
 
page 9
 
There is a PTA for the Senshin Gakuin, but the impression is that
 
it is not real active.
 I was unable to attend the one meeting I heard
 
about.
 The Gakuin is governed, however, by a Cabinet made up of a Principal,
 
Head Instructor,  Instructor Chairman, Assistants, Treasurer and Advisor,
 
(See Appendix I for specific names.)
 These positions are filled by members
 
of the Board of Senshin Buddhist Church.
 The Board has about 90 members,
 
30 to 35 of which are very active.
 Mr.  Inouye explained that when a major
 
decision has to be made it is brought before the Board for discussion
 
and a ruling. As an example, Mr.  Inouye said that if he wanted to add
 
a language class that was strictly Japanese conversation, he would first
 
suggest it to the Board for their ideas and decision.
 
The Senshin Gakuin is also a member of the American Japanese Language
 
School Association which is part of the Buddhist Churches of America and
 
is headquartered at the Hompa Horigwanji Temple in downtown Los Angeles.
 
They sponsor conferences every three months for the teachers in the Southern
 
California area to get together and discuss problems,  ideas and curriculum
 
materials.
 The teachers determine what should be included in the curriculum
 
materials and then ask the Japanese Education Department to help print the
 
books.
 
Apparently,  there are two such organizations where Japanese Language
 
School teachers can obtain materials and discuss curriculum.
 The other
 
is called the Kyoto System.
 Ms. Ono explained that the school in West Los
 
Angeles where she taught before coming to Senshin Gaajsin
 uses the Kyoto
 
System.
 One basic difference is that the Kyoto System requires th
 
teachers be trained.
 Since the Senshin Gakuin does- not use the Kyc
 
System, they do not require that their teachers be trained.
 However,  tb
 
teachers can choose to go through training.
 While Ms. Ono has never had
 
page 10
 
any formal training, her main interest has always been languages.  That,
 
combined with her experience enables her to teach Japanese to the lower
 
levels.  Mr.  Inouye, on the other hand, has been through two two-month
 
seminars with Sumako Kimizuka, from the University of Southern California
 
Japanese Language School.
 She offers seminars every year through the
 
American Japanese Language School Association.
 Mr. Inouye participated ten
 
years ago and again seven years ago.  Ms. Ono has expressed an interest
 
but said that the fee is very high and the course is quite time consuming.
 
Another basic difference between the American Japanese Language
 
School Association and the Kyoto System is that the Kyoto System teaches the
 
katakana characters first, then the hirakana and, last, the kanji.
 These
 
are the three types of characters found in the Japanese written language.
 
The katakana is used for translat ing other languages into Japanese, the
 
hirakana is common Japanese, and the kanji is the complex Chinese characters
 
The American Japanese Language School Association teaches the hirakana first,
 
katakana second and intersperses a few kanji from the beginning.  One
 
might infer that teaching the katakana first, emphasizes the teaching of
 
Japanese as a second language rather than a first language -
 a major
 
consideration among Japanese language teachers.
 
This consideration of Japanese as first versus second language,
 
is reflected in the choice of curriculum materials.  Mr.  Inouye explained
 
that in the past they used books that were printed and published in
 
Japan.
 Now, however, they use the books that are developed here.  He
 
feels they are "much easier" but, because they are printed here, "they seem
 
to fit these kids better."  They do not have much information about
 
Japanese culture and traditions.
 He seems to regret that a bit, but feels
 
the kids are better able to learn the language with these books.
 The
 
books are accompanied by workbooks which have excercises to complement
 
page 1
1
 
each section in the textbooks.
 Both teachers design their own tests and
 
students are graded on an ABC basis.
 (See Appendix II)
 Mr.  Inouye also
 
designs a test for the high school students who wish to receive their
 
language credit in Japanese.' Test is approved by Dr. Kumizuko at University
 
o - Southern California.
 Students do receive homework from the workbooks
 
and most of them do it on Friday night.  Ms. Ono said that she only gives
 
about 1/2 -
 1 hour worth of homework.  The Kyoto System gives much more
 
homework and asks the parents to help their children.
 She feels this is not
 
constructive because the parents end up doing most of the homework and the
 
children don't learn.
 Both teachers feel that the children forget all
 
Japanese during the week.
 
While Mr. i
Tnouye sticks closely to the format of the books, Ms.
 
Ono prefers to combine the books from the United States with a book from
 
Japan.
 She feels that the books from the United States are very basic
 
Japanese, teaching how to count, tell time, order lunch, etc.,
 
and can get quite boring.
 The book from Japan has more stories about
 
Japan, including folktales, more grammar, and more words.
 She explained
 
that the book expresses more feeling in Japanese and she wants to teach
 
those feelings to the children.
 She used as an example, the many ways
 
the Japanese  language can express the beauty of a flower.
 Knowing the
 
Japanese appreciation of nature I found this particularly appropriate.
 
It is interesting to note that Ms. Ono, who is 30 years younger than
 
Mr.  Inouye, includes more cultural teachings in her class than Mr.  Inouye.
 
On the one hand, she has been in the United States only twenty years
 
compared to Mr.  Inouye's 60 years, but it may also reflect the mandatory
 
americanization that was a part of his experiences during World War II.
 
page 12
 
In fact,  I found that many of the Issei  (
first to arrive from Japan)
 
and Nisei (
second generation) emphasized this concern for being good
 
American citizens.
 
Because enrollment was so low this year the Senshin Gaukin could
 
not afford the annual dues to the  American Japanese Language School
 
Association, so they did not join.
 However, they continue to use the same
 
curriculum materials and Mr.  Inouye was able to give me the name of the
 
store in Little Tokyo where I can buy the books.
 
The students at the Senshin Gai1
,kin are divided between the two teachers
 
according to proficiency.  A student's gradelevel in language school may
 
not always correspond with his or her grade level in regular school.
 Yet
 
is rare for a student to fail.
 Sumiko Ono teaches the lower level,
 
ades one through three and had four students, three girls and one boy,
 
is past year.
 Three of those students will graduate into the upper level
 
Mrs. Ono is hopeful that enough new students will enroll to
 
a teaching next year.
 She began teaching Japanese in 1975
 
and has been at Senshin Gakuin for two years.
 
Henry Inouye has been teaching the upper level classes, grades
 
four through nine, at Senshin for 21 years.
 This past year he had about
 
twenty students, thirteen girls and seven boys.  Three students graduated
 
from the class and three will move up from the lower level, so his class
 
will remain about the same size.
 I
tis interesting to note that during the
 
four visits that I made to the class, I never saw the three students who
 
graduated on June 19, 1982.  Perhaps their coursework finished earlier.
 
Classes meet every Saturday from 8:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m., September
 
th o
 the middle of June.  The morning is divided into four 50 minute
 
sessions with a ten minute recess between each session.
 The subjects
 
page 13
 
covered are conversation, reading, writing, meaning, and composition.
 
Ms. Ono likes to begin her day with conversation or a new subject because
 
she feels that the children are most awake and alert at that hour.
 The
 
second period, she refers to one of the books and focuses on reading anc
 
meaning or translation.  The third period they concentrate on writin
 
characters and, occaisionally, composition.
 Composition is very dif
 
for children at this age so it is kept to a minimum.
 Because the children
 
tend to be tired and hungry by the fourth period, Ms. Ono likes to involve
 
then in some cultural traditionssuch as origami, folktales, and
 
painting.  These are a more enjoyable learning tooland will hold the
 
children's attention.
 She tries to conduct these sessions in Japanese.
 
Mr.  Inouye follows a similar pattern except, rather than the cultural
 
traditions in the fourth period, he gives a test in the second period, on
 
something the students have learned.
 He explained to me that in the past,
 
he included lessons about Japanese culture, and especially folk dance, but
 
Reverend Maseo Kodani ( Rev. Mas) includes so muchof that in the Dharma
 
School that he dose not need to include it in the language school.
 This
 
suggests the complementary nature of the two programs.
 Mr.  Inouye does
 
occaisionally tell stories about life in Japan and sometimes will bring in
 
a film from theJapanese Consulate or Japan Airlines.
 His focus, however,
 
is language and, especially conversation.
 Both teachers feel that,
 
while the reading and writing are important, the most important aspect of
 
learning the language is conversation -
 to speak comfortably and with the
 
proper pronunciation.  They seem to feel that this is more important for re-
turning to Japan and speaking with the Issei than for continuing and
 
maintaining the language in the United States.
 However, Ms. Ono did say
 
that since they are Japanese,  they should speak Japanese.
 
page 14
 
Again, the issue of Japanese as a first or second language is
 
important in terms of the focus and format of the classes.
 Years ago,
 
when the Nisseiwere learning Japanese in order to communicate with their
 
family, the classes focused on grammar and were conducted entirely in
 
Japanese.  Mr.  Inouye said that he would "get mad" at the students for
 
using English in the classroom.
 One former student could remember the
 
smack of the ruler across the knuckles for such an offense.
 Today, however,
 
the third and fourth generation students require a different method of
 
teaching.  As Ms. Ono explained, it is important that the teachers speak
 
English in order to be able to explain things to the students.
 
"I strongly believe you have to communicate
 
with the children first, then you teach
 
Japanese to them."
 
She also felt it essential to build a positive relationship with the
 
students in order to spark their interest.
 Because it is a second
 
language, the students do not have to retain what they learn in order to
 
communicate on a daily basis with their family.  This combination of
 
both languages seems to create a more relaxed atmosphere in the classroom
 
than was evident in the past.Both teachers also felt that a more relaxed
 
atmosphere is essential for today's students.
 They do not respond we 1
 
to the structured lecture format.
 
The classroomsthemselves look very much like regular school
 
classrooms with rows of desk/tables and chairs, large blackboards on two
 
walls, a bulletin board on the backwall, and cabinets of bookshelves under
 
the windows on the fourth wall.
 Testbooks and students' records are kept
 
in a small room adjacent to Mr.  Inouye's classroom.
 The walls are
 
decorated with posters from Japan, lists of kanji characters, a small

School students.
 The bookshelves are filled with Japanese children's
 
magazines, a r t  supplies and Japanese toys.
 
In Ms. Ono's class, a few tables are pulled together and the
 
children sit around in a circle with the teacher.
 I was reminded of the
 
kind of school sessions one might experience in the home.
 There is
 
a feeling of love and caring between the teacher and her students.
 These
 
younger students seem sincerely interested in what they are learning.
 
The only exception was the boy who stayed apar i4
'or
 awhile and may have
 
been slightly frustrated to be the oldest and the only boy.
 He will be
 
happy to graduate into the upper level next year.
 I might add that there
 
was no pressure placed upon the boy to cooperate more closely with the
 
other students.
 Even he became more attentive as the day wore on.
 
Mr.  Inouye's class was a bit different.
 At first is seemed that
 
the students were able to get away with more "goofing around" than I ever
 
saw in school.
 But I soon realized that, among the twenty students, there
 
are six levels of learning.  Consequently, the students practice among
 
themsieves while Mr.  Inouye moves from one level to the other, working
 
individually with the students in each level.
 Occaisionally, all the
 
students would listen while each one recited from his/her reading book.
 
Of course, there a r e  a few "bad boys" who love to goof around, but, in
 
general, the students seem to enjoy working together.
 I noticed that
 
Mr. Inouye is extremely helpful to the students while they are taking
 
tests.
 The students call him "sensei" which means teacher or wise one
 
and each class begins and ends with the traditional bow of respect.
 
When I asked how much the Buddhist teachings are a part of the
 
language school, both teachers responded with "not at all."
 They make
 
a point of keeping any religious beliefs out of the lessons so that
 
page 16
 
anyone can take the classes.
 It is important to keep in mind, though,
 
that almost all of the students are members of the Senshin Buddhist
 
Church, as are both the teachers.
 Again, the complementary nature
 
of the two programs is evident.
 
The Senshin Gakuin culminates each year with the graduation
 
ceremonies which are held in the Social Hall.
 In the past, they also
 
had a speech contest, but the class has not been large enough for seven
 
years to continue the tradition.
 The graduation ceremonies seem to have
 
combined the two  (Appendix III).
 
With the exception of a few moments, the ceremony is conducted
 
entirely in Japanese.  The program is divided into two parts.
 During the
 
first part, the students are seated in the rows with the audience while the
 
President of the church (Akira Kiyohara), the Head Instructor (Henry
 
Inouye), the Gakuin Advisor (Dr. Ryo Munekata), and the Principal
 
(Reverend Hoshin Fujikado), all Cabinet members, are seated on the stage.
 
An American and a Japanese flag hang on the wall behind them.
 The
 
ceremony opens with the Star Spangled Banner (in English).Graduation
 
diplomas and Perfect Attendence Awards  (to eight of the twenty-five students)
 
are given to deserving students during this part of the ceremony.
 Each
 
student walks up on the stage alone and recieves the award and a gift from
 
the members of the Cabinet,
 Advice and memories are exchanged
 
between the graduates and the younger students.  These brief speeches are
 
punctuated by a traditional Japanese graduation song and Auld Lang Syne,
 
both sung in Japanese.
 The woman guiding me through the ceremony told me
 
that Auld Lang Syne was also a traditional Japanese graduation song.  This
 
year an award was also given to Mr Inouye for twenty-one years of dedication
 
as a language school teacher at Senshin.
 
For the second half of the ceremony, the students took the stage and,
 
page 17
 
one by one, recited or read a Japanese piece of their choice.
 All these
 
pieces were chosen from their reading books.
 In this way,all the
 
student áre honored for their progress.
 This year, Ms Ono's class
 
recited from memory a Japanese folktale.
 Each student recited one part
 
of the tale, holding a drawing they had done depicting that aspect of
 
the story.
 The upper level students read, in pairs, various dialogues.
 
One was a story, one a proverbial tale, and one an accounting of the
 
geographical features of earth.
 
After the service, photographs were taken of the graduates, the
 
teachers, and the Cabinet and a feast was laid out for everyone to enjoy.
 
Rev. Mas is always mentioning the Japanese love of food -
 he loves to eat.
 
With the exception of one cake, the food was very "American."
 
The ceremony seemed to be a positive comi
 
and Japanese traditions (
including an Ikebana
 
food table).
 This reflects Rev. Mas's concept of trying to feel comfortable
 
with one's Japanese-American identity.
 
It was after the service that I was able to talk to many of the parents
 
and get their ideas about the language school.
 In general, the parents
 
send their children to the language school because they feel it is important
 
for them to have a sense of their cultural identity.
 That feel that
 
language is one of the most important aspects of culture.
 Understanding
 
the language will help one understand the culture.
 This reflects Ms. Ono's
 
feeling about teaching the children Japanese feelings through language.
 
The parents also feel that, while their children will grow up as Americans
 
an understanding of their Japanese heritage will help them deal with the
 
fact that they are different than most
 
throughout life.
 For these, and other
 
only opportunity for their children to
 
people they will associate with
 
parents, the Senshin Gakuin is the
 
interact with other Japanese-American
 
page 18
 
children.
 
For some parents, it is important that their children be able to
 
communicate in Japan, should they ever visit the country.
 It is under-
standably difficult for someone who visually appears Japanese to feel
 
comfortable in Japan without speaking the language.
 One parent explained
 
the changes in parents motivations over the years.
 He said that, at first,
 
Japanese was taught to children because parents thought they would be
 
returning to Japan and wanted their children to maintain their proficiency.
 
The next generation taught their children so they could communicate with
 
the Issei and Nisei.
 Now, the language is taught so the children will be able
 
to aid the United States in maintaining good relations with Japan.
 
Another reason expressed by both parents and children is that Japanese can
 
be taken as a language requirement in high school.
 As long as they need
 
a  language requir ement,  it might as well be Japanese.
 
In many cases, the parents do not speak Japanese.
 They grew u
 
at a time when most Japanese were concerned about demonstrating their
 
loyalties to the United States, so few Japanese traditions were emphasized
 
in their homes.
 For those who did go to a language school, the classes
 
were very strict.
 This was especially true at Senshin.
 It should be
 
mentioned that, before Sumiko Ono began teaching at Senshin two years ago,
 
her position was filled by Mrs. Oshiro who had been teaching there for
 
nineteen years.
 Both Mrs. Oshiro and Mr. Inouye began teaching in the
 
structured format required by the times.
 Today, most parents and teachers
 
agree that the looser format is more effective
 
Despite all these feelings, Mr.  Inouye occa sionally feels like he
 
is "babysitting" because the parents drop the children off, come back four
 
hours later, and do not always express an interest in their child's progress.
 
Obviously, this attitude can also be found in the regular schools, and is not
 
page 19
 
the attitude of all parents.
 Nonetheless, Mr. Inouye feels there are
 
lots of thins the children would rather be doing on a Saturday morning.
 
Ms.  Ono also expressed her sorrow that the children
 
1
1 .
.. they hate to go to Japanese school,  even
 
my kids,  they always complaining.
 That hurting
 
me alot."
 
When I turned to one of her students to ask if that was true,  the student
 
shook her head as if to say "no."
 
I think that, in general, the children do not really mind going to
 
language school.
 They may complain about it before they get there, but
 
once there, they seem to have a good time.
 most of them are there because
 
their parents want them to learn Japanese.
 They are not sure why and, when
 
interviewed, they seemed to have an apathetic attitude.
 
"Since I
'm Japanese, I guess they want me
 
to learn Japanese so if I go to Japan, I
 
can talk to my relatives..."
 
"Well, I don't know,  I don't remember, um,  I
 
remember my mom said, like, when I was little,
 
all  I did was talk Japanese.
 But,  then, when
 
I went to school, I forgot everything cuz evervone
 
else was speaking English.
 She said if  !
 
remembered it, then I wouldn't have to ccm�-,
 
but,  then, I didn't remember it so I have
 
1. m u st
1 1
 
be remembered that there have not been many teachers at the language school
 
for the students to make a significant comparison.  The students did
 
agree that a good teacher is one who can keep you interested and can
 
actually teach you something.  Mr.  Inouye seems to meet these criteria,
 
though many of the older students are no longer sincerely interested in
 
learning Japanese.
 "It's so boring" especially because the books are so
 
corny.
 Those interviewed did have a sense of the value of knowing Japanese
 
for the future, though they are not sure why.
 
Two of the students interviewed said that recess is the best part
 
of the language school.  During recess, the children go into another class-
room and play music  (AM stations), talk, read through American and Japanese
 
magazines, and play with the Japanese toys in the cabinets.
 English is the
 
main language spoken, interspersed with a very few Japanese words for
 
effect or as a form of private joking.
 In most cases, the children can
 
read and understand Japanese better than they can speak it.
 This reflects
 
the trend that both teachers expressed concern for.
 
Because the students attend both the Senshin Gakuin and the Dharma
 
School, they do seem to know each other well.
 The older students see each
 
other at regular school but because they are in different grades, they do
 
not spend much time together.
 There are a few pairs who are best friends.
 
The junior and senior high schools in the area are culturally integrated so
 
the Senshin students have friends from a variety of cultures.
 In fact,
 
several of them expressed an interest in learning Spanish, even more than
 
Japanese.
 I asked if they know any friends who go.  to other language
 
schools.  A few have friends at other Japanese language schools as well as
 
friends who go to Hebrew School.
 They continued that they rarely shared
 
their language school experiences except to teach each other the usual
 
four-letter words.
 
page 2
1
 
In most cases, the students indicated that they preferred the Dharma
 
School to the Senshin Gakuin because "you don't have to study Japanese."
 
It was difficult to determine how the Dharma School compared to regular
 
school, but the language school took an
 
seemed to prefer math, biology, and read
 
Given an opportunity to make any ch
 
first concern is to increase enrollment.  There is a feeling that, as
 
parents with young children renew their involvement with the Church,
 
enrollment will begin to increase.
 Currently, the Church has social
 
organizations for all age groups except the twenty-five to thirty-five
 
year olds.
 Consequently, this age group is less involved with the church
 
when they are busy raising children.
 But, as the children begin school
 
many of the adults become involved in the Adult Buddhist Association (ABA).
 
This may explain the sparseness of the younger classes in both the language
 
school and Dharma School
 
Another desired change expressed particularly by Mr.  Inouye concerns
 
the lack of conversational ease on the part of the students.
 He would like
 
to add a language class that would be strictly Japanese conversation. This
 
kind of class might also be offered for adults.
 
A final concern expressed by the students is to update the books so
 
they are not so corny and boring.
 This might make the class more enjoyable,
 
thus improving comprehension.
 
In summary, although the Senshin Gakuin has experienced major
 
fluctuations in enrollment, it is still considered an important means for
 
this Japanese-American community to understand, maintain, and enhance
 
their sense of identity.
 
page 22
 
THE SENSHIN DHARMA SCHOOL
 
It is difficult to separate the Senshin Dharma School from the
 
total sum of educational experiences at the Senshin Buddhist Church.
 
There are so many opportunities for church members to get together and explore,
 
not only the Buddhist teachings, but, also,  their Japanese and
 
Japanese-American heritage.
 One of the guiding principles of
 
Buddhist education is that Buddhism is democratic.
 All are "fellow
 
travellors who tred the same path of the Nembutsu."  Teachers and
 
students are striving together to discover the Dharma.
 At the same time,
 
Buddhism recognizes the individual and that each individual has
 
unique abilities,  interests, and needs.
 This is evident in the diversity
 
of programs at Senshin.
 
In conjunction with the Dharma School classes, there are social groups
 
for each age level, a Gagaku class  (traditional court music), a Taiko
 
drum group, weeknight adult study classes, Sumi-e painting classes,
 
various practice sessions for traditional dances before major festivals,
 
and the Reverend's sermons, all of which offer church members the opportunity
 
to explore the Buddhist's teachings as well as their Japanese and
 
Japnaese-American heritage. One characteristic of the Japanese-American
 
community in Southern California is that many of them are now third or fourth
 
generation.
 This combined with the post World War II efforts to show
 
loyalty to the United States as meant that adults, as well as children, are
 
learning about their cultural background.
 
The Senshin Buddhist Church is unique in Southern California because
 
of its attempts to reintroduce Buddhist ritual and tradition into the lives
 
of its members.
 Several members
. expressed to me the belief that most
 
page23
 
cultural traditions are generated by belief systems, and this is certainly
 
true of the Japanese Buddhists.
 For instance,  Ikebana,  the art of
 
flower arranging, began on the altar.
 The arrangements had meaning in a
 
religious context.
 Now,  in many cases, the meaning is lost,  though the
 
tradition remains intact.
 The Senshin Buddhist Church is trying to put
 
the meaning back into the tradition.
 This is especially true of their annual
 
Obon Festival.
 Most Buddhist Churches in the area have opened their
 
festivals to the public, utilizing the opportunity as a fundraiser for the
 
church.
 These other festivals are very much like a carnival and many of
 
the religious meanings are lost (I am reminded of the Christmas rituals in
 
the Christian religion).
 At Senshin,  the festival is small and many of the
 
rituals associated with Obon have been brought back with explanations
 
where possible.
 The atmosphere is reverent, yet very comfortable and
 
accepting.
 Members from other churches attend the Senshin Obon.
 
The person responsible for initiating many of these changes is
 
Reverend Maseo Kodani  ( Rev. Mas) who has been at Senshin for fourteen years.
 
When he first came to Senshin, membership was quite low.
 As the Histor
  
the Church explains,  Senshin was one of the first churches to be used a
 
hostel for Japanese-Americans returning from the internment camps after
 
the'war.
 Many of these families settled in the area and became the
 
members of the Senshin Buddhist Church.
 However, as the children of those
 
families grew up,  several chose to move away when they got married, causing
 
a noticable decline in membership.
 The  1950 1s
�
 seem to have been the
 
peak period with as many as three hundred students in the DhaLrma School.
 
That number has decreased to about sixty  now.
 Rev. Mas feels that the
 
membership has leveled off at a good number and he does not see a need
 
for recuiting new members.
 He explained that about one third of the
 
Japanese-American community in Los Angeles is interested in learning about
 
their cultural heritage, one third does not care,  and one third purposely
 
aviods it.
 Senshin would rather have a small group of sin �erely interested
 
a very story-like manner.
 In fact,  "sermon" seems an inappropriate word.
 
Each one transmits to the listerners a little bit more about their own
 
personalities.
 
Like the Senshin Gakuin, the Senshin Dharma School has a Cabinet
 
responsible for making major decisions.
 It consists of the Chairpei-son(s),
 
Secretary, Treasurer,
 Hospitality Committee, Ex-Officio, and an Advisor
 
(
see Appendix V for this year's officers).
 These are all members of the
 
church.
 The Cabinet meets once a month with all the teachers to
 
discuss the program for the upcoming two months.
 Although the teach
 
allowed quite a bit of freedom in planning their classes, these meet.
 
are a means for maintaining a meaningful and cohesive program
 
The Senshin Buddhist church is a member of the Buddhist Churches of
 
America (BCA) headquartered in San Francisco.
 The BCA publishes all the
 
curriculum materials for its members.  Apparently, they are quite prolific.
 
The Senshin Buddhist Church also publishes a variety of service books and
 
is currently working on a history of their altar. In fact, the church has
 
a large Library/Information Center located in the classroom building. The
 
offices of the Reverends are adjacent to this room so it seems to be a central
 
gathering place for church members.
 The room has several tables and chairs,
 
bookshelves stacked with books about a wide variety of belief systems,
 
photographs of all the Reverends that have served Senshin, Japanese calendars,
 
a counter with a variety of hand-made objects on it (mostly made by members),
 
a glass case with religious objects in it,
 and a counter space for flyers
 
and announcements about upcoming community events. The table in the middle
 
of the room is currently piled high with research materials for the publica-
tion on the Senshin's altar.
 
In the past, the curriculum materials from the BCA have been in
 
pamphlet form and have focused almost entirely on Buddhist teachings.
 
Recently, the Dharma School recieved the new Dharma School Teachers Guide
  
page 26
 
from the BCA.
 It is in notebook form and has 433 pages of guidelines
 
for teaching Buddhism to children.
 The subjects include Buddhist teachings,
 
various traditional and non-traditional arts and crafts, ideas for
 
conducting family histories and exploring one's self, and approaches to
 
the many American and Buddhist holidays throughout the year.
 (
see Appendix
 
VI for Table of Contents).
 All curriculum materials are distributed to the
 
churches, and, in turn, to the teachers and students, free of charge.
 No
 
tuition is charged to the students.
 Instead, once a year, the parents are
 
asked to make a donation to the Dharma School.
 Occaisionally, the Dharma
 
School will have a fundraising event, if more funds are needed.
 There does
 
not seem to be a set amount for donations.
 
The Dharma School classes meet for about an hour and a half each
 
Sunday in the classroom building of the church complex.
 These are the
 
ame classrooms used by the Senshin Gakuin.
 Students are divided according
 
ac
re and each level is given a Japanese Buddhist name:
 
Tanpopo
 ages 1-3
 
7akura
 age 4 -
 first grade
 
Tuji
 second -
 fourth grade
 
l
asu
 fifth and sixth grade
 
.
sangha
 junior high school
 
Kabocha
 senior high school
 
There is also an adult study class that meets at the same time on Sunday
 
and again on Wednesday evenings in members homes.
 
The teachers for the Dharma School are all members of the church.
 
They teach entirely on a volunteer basis and all of them have been through
 
Dharma School, many at Senshin.
 Currently, there are fourteen teachers;
 
three for Tanpopo, one for Sakura, five for Fuji, three for Hasu, one for
 
Sangha, and one for Kabocha.
 They range in age from seventeen to fifty,
 
andin experience from two to thirty years.
 
When the Dharma School first began, pre World War II, the teachers
 
page 27
 
all  held  regular jobs as public school teachers.
 As Rev. Mas explained,
 
that was one of the few jobs that Japanese women could have at the time,
 
and most of the Dharma School teachers were women.
 The traditional arts
 
at the church were also taught by a woman, usually the Reverend's wife.
 
Traditionally, the Reverend's wife was trained in these arts and was
 
responsible for flower arranging, food preparation, etc. for all the
 
services.
 Consequently, all the classes, whether religious or artistic,
 
were very structured.
 Students were required to stand and repeat a
 
moral code when the teacher entered the classroom.
 Like the Senshin
 
Gakuin at the time, the class format was very formal with lectures about
 
the various teachings of Buddhism.
 For the most part, the teachings were
 
repeated each year, but with greater detail and depth as the students got
 
older.
 Little attention was directed toward other aspects of Japanese
 
life.
 This format continued until after the war.
 
Today's Dharma School is quite different.
 The teachers are not
 
required to have any formal training.
 A knowledge of Buddhism and the
 
desire to explore and share Buddhist philosophy with children seem to
 
be the qualifications.
 All classes are taught in English.
 The BCA
 
does offer conferences and workshops for any interested teachers.
 These
 
are held periodically throughout the year.
 The workshops guide teachers
 
in presenting the materials to the students, and offer an opportunity for
 
sharing ideas.
 There is also an annual conference for the Young Buddhist
 
Association (
high school and college level-YBA) where students can interact
 
with other Japanese- Americans.
 One teacher expressed to me that these
 
conferences have taken on a predominantly social characteristic over the
 
years.
 She feels sorrow that such an opportunity to share religious ideas
 
has become more of a social event, but agreed that it is, perhaps, as
 
important.
 
page 28
 
Many significant changes have occured in the Dharma School format
 
over the past fourteen years.
 In fact, Rev. Mas feels that many of the
 
changes would not have been possible at most other churches.
 Perhaps the
 
most drastic, and the one most difficult to accept, involves when the
 
Buddhist Doctrines are taught to the children.
 There are two schools
 
of thought.
 Some feel that the Doctrines should be taught from the
 
beginning -
 that to wait until the children are older is a waste of
 
valuable time.
 Rev. Mas, on the other hand,
 belives that children will
 
understand the Doctrines better if they have practical experience to
 
apply them to.
 He explained that enlightenment can be quite brutal
 
because it is achieved through egolessness.  He emphasized that one must
 
have a healthy ego in order to throw it away.
 For this reason, he has
 
introduced several programs that help members, both young and old, develop
 
a stronger sense of identity in order to prepare for the process of
 
enlightenment.
 He feels it is important that Japanese-Americans understand
 
their Japanese, as well as their American background.
 They are not
 
totally Japanese,yet, they are not totally American.
 That can be quite
 
painful, especially for young adults.
 They need to be exposed to
 
r'ngnizable cultural traditions as well as those hidden traditions which
 
.
uence one's personality, such as relationships within the family unit.
 
Ls goal is to help Japanese-Americans feel
  comfortable  with the fact that
 
oey are different.
 
The Dharma School programs reflect this goal.
 The students are involved
 
in such activities as batik for the Won Festival, researching family crests,
 
haiku, videotaping the major events ,painting self-portraits, and, for the
 
older students, examining Buddhist Doctrines.
 Each student is also a member
 
of a social group within the church that is another opportunity for them
 
to interact.  These groups are:
 
Golden Chain
 girls, fourth -
 sixth grade
 
page 29
 
Boy Scouts
 boys, fourth -
 sixth grade
 
Sanghateens
 junior high school
 
Jr.YBA
 high school
 
Sr. YBA
 college age
 
ABA
 adults,
 
Dana Guild
 adult women, 50-65
 
Fujinkai
 senior adult women
 
I tried to discover if the social groups focused more on the cultural
 
spects of Buddhism and the Dharma School on the religious aspect, but
 
as unsuccessful.
 It seems that the Dharma School covers both.
 
The most interesting class I sat in on was the adult study class.
 It
 
was here that I realized that it is equally as important for the adults to
 
learn about their heritage as it is for them to encourage their children to.
 
This particular class focused on the many differences between the Japanese
 
and the Chinese.
 Rev. Mas emphasized several Japanese characteristics
 
as they could be discovered in Japanese literature.  The adults  (mostly
 
women) seemed very attentive and showed much recognition of the char-
acteristics he was illustrating.
 Again, he related things to everyday
 
living.
 For exam ple, he was talking about the Japanese preference for
 
odd numbers  (versus the Chinese preference for even numbers)  ,  using
 
Ikebana as an example.  Most women agreed that, when arranging flowers
 
at home, four flowers in one arrangement would not be appealing.
 It
 
would have to be three or five.
 
The Kinnara Taiko drumming group and the Gagaku traditional court
 
music are also important aspects of adult involvement.
 Participants
 
range in age from seventeen to fifty and include men and women.
 There
 
is also a Taiko group for younger people.
 This is not true of the
 
Gagaku group but members often bring their children to the practice to
 
expose them to the tradition, and its strange sounds.
 As Rev. Mas
 
explained, if his daughter chooses not to hang on to her Japanese
 
identity, that is her choice.
 But "I want her to know what she
 
is throwing away."
 Because of the method of training for the Taiko and
 
page 30
 
Gagaku groups,  it is often difficult for young people to maintain
 
involvement for long.
 The philosophy of egolessness is predominant.
 
Members are encouraged to learn all the instruments and all their parts,
 
but little reinforcement (whether positive or negative) is given.
 
r
n for understanding

 ties of everyday life.
 
s interrelationship between cultural traditions and belief is
 
racteristic of Senshin, as is this method of teaching.
 
Another important aspect of these two musical groups is that,
 
on the one hand, the oldest form of orchestral music in the world
 
is being preserved by the Gagaku group (the newest piece written was
 
in 900AD).
 On the other hand, the Taiko, though traditional, combines
 
the experiences of Japanese-Americans in Los Angeles with this tradition.
 
African, Latino, and Native American rhythms are combined with jazz,
 
rhythm & blues and the traditional Japanese farms in each presentation.
 
Rev. Mas explains
 
"That's fine.
 You preserve it, and then you have
 
something else,
 so each time you add something.
 
The Japanese never throw it away.
 They always
 
just add to it.
 That's what we want to do.  We
 
We want to say that if a new form comes,  it
 
doesn't replace the old."
 
A great example of the idea was expressed in a performance by the Sanghateens
 
which they designed for their teacher as a bridal shower present.  The
 
dancers were all dressed in traditional kimonos and samurai garb and
 
many of the moves were traditional.
 But the music was disco played out
 
of a cassette recorder/radio.
 
The Senshin congregation seems to have responded enthusiastically
 
page 3
1
 
to the programming.
 As with all change, reations were mixed, initially.
 
Even now, some feel that the cultural traditions have taken precedent over
 
the religious teachings, that perhaps more balance is needed.  Yet, this
 
need for balance many be more closely related to a need for order.
 The
 
diverse programming gives an air of disorder.
 Dharma School no longer seems
 
lika a school.
 One student said that they do not really have classes -
 it
 
seems more like hobbies.
 A teacher expressed frustration that she was not
 
able to fit all of her religious lessons into this year's program, because
 
of so many other projects.
 
At the same time, reactions to the new Teachers Guide are varied.
 
While most of the teachers feel that the new Guide is a welcomed change
 
to the kind of teaching aides they have had, they also indicated that it
 
probably will not be used much at Senshin.
 Rev. Mas said he would probably
 
refer to it occa sionally for a good story to include in a sermon, but that
 
it is too structured for the current Dharma School teaching staff.  Terry
 
Nakatawase, a teacher who has been at Senshin for thirty years, said that
 
the most productive way to utilize the Guide would be to involve  the teache
 
in a few workshops to acquaint them with all the possibilities in the Guide.
 
The Guide has not yet been used with the students so it is difficult
 
to know what their reactions will be.  They do seem to be responsive to the
 
increased cultural activities.
 As Rev. Mas explains, the cultural  activities are
 
all for a practical application of Buddhist philosophy.  When they begin to
 
e
arnestly examine the Buddhist teachings, they will have something to
 
apply it to.
 
Perhaps the best assessment of the value of the Dharma School has
 
been given by one student who explained that her girlfriend had invited her to
 
church one day and she has been coming on her own ever since.
 She is only
 
fourteen and has made the choice herself.

The Senshin Buddhist Church,  although unique in Southern California,
 
in 1982, is not unique when one considers movements of people throughout
 
the world.
 The church has always been a central meeting ground for
 
immigrant groups as they arrived on foreign soil.
 For many, the church was
 
the only tie with their homeland, culture,  and language. 
The church
 
brought people together and gave them a sense of identity and security
 
in a strange environment.
 Over the years, however, as immigrant groups
 
began to feel more comfortable in American society, the church became
 
less important as a cultural center.
 At Senshin, however,  the bond
 
between belief and culture is, once again, reinforced. 
And for many,
 
this bond gives them strength.
 
Obviously,  this study has only begun to scratch the surface at
 
Senshin.
 Although the people I have come to know, have been very
 
helpful and warm,  I feel that I have just begun to get a complete
 
understanding of the educational programs they are involved in.
 For
 
instance, there are several Issei and Nisei that should be interviewed
 
for a more indepth understanding of the relationship between belief
 
from more students.
 Their feelings and ideas are of part �cii -

 Teachers
 and
 students
 are
 
striving together to discover
 the
 Dharma.
 At
 the
 same
 time,
 
Buddhism recognizes that
 each
 individual
 has  unique abilities,
 
interests,  and  needs.
 This
 is
 evident
 in
 the
 diversity
 of
 
educational
 programs
 at
 the
 Senshin
 Buddhist
 Church in
 Los
 
Angeles,  California.
 
There are  two distinct and on-going programs  that
 exist
 at
 
Senshin
 for
 the  benefit of its members.
 They are
 the
 Senshin
 
Gakuin,
 a  Japanese
 language
 school,
 and
 the  Senshin
 Dharma
 
School,  a Japanese Buddhist  study  school.
 Because  these programs
 
are operated
 independently,  they will be presented  separately  in
 
this
 report.
 Yet,  it is important  to keep in
 mind
 that
 both
 
programs are
 indicative of  the efforts of this Japanese-American
 
community to explore,
 understand
 and maintain its identity.
 In
 
light of the complementary nature
 of
 the
 programs,
 they
 were
 
documented  concurrently.

In
 conjunction
 with
 the
 Senshin
 Gakuin
 and  the
 Dharma
 
School,  there are affiliated groups  for each age
 level,  a Gagaku
 
class,  a Taiko  drum group,  weeknight adult study classes,
 Sumi-e
 
painting
 classes,
 various
 practice
 sessions
 for
 traditional
 
dances before
 major  festivals,  and  the Reverend's weekly sermon,
 
all of which offer church
 members
 the
 opportunity
 to
 explore
 
Buddhist
 teachings
 as
 well
 as
 their
 Japanese
 and
 
Japanese-American
 heritage.
 One
 characteristic
 of
 the
 
Japanese-American
 community  in Southern California is  that
 many
 
of  them are  third  or  fourth  generation.
 This,
 combined with the
 
post
 World
 War
 II
 efforts
 to
 express loyalty  to the
 United
 
States,  has meant  that adults,  as well as children,  need  to learn
 
about  their  cultural  background.
 [2]
 
Like the  Senshin Buddhist  Church in the  1950's,
 most of  the
 
temples in the area have
 adopted
 Protestant
 rituals,
 such
 as
 
hymns and organ music,  into  their
 services.
 Yet,
 the
 Senshin
 
Buddhist Church is  unique in  Southern California because
 of
 its
 
efforts to reintroduce Buddhist ritual
 and
 tradition
 into
 the
 
lives of its members.
 Several members expressed  the  belief
 that
 
most
 cultural
 traditions are  generated by
 belief
 systems.  For
 
instance,  Ikebana,  the art of
 flower
 arranging,
 began
 at
 the
 
altar.
 In many  cases,  the religious meaning is
 lost,  though the

radition remains
 
intact.
 The Senshin  Buddhist Church is  trying
 
o put  the meaning  back
 into
 the tradition.
 This is especially
 
true of  their  annual Obon Festival.  Most Buddhist  churches  in  the
 
area have opened  their Obon  Festival  to the public,  utilizing  the
 
opportunity
 as
 
a  fundraiser
 for
 the
 church.
 These
 other
 
festivals are  very much like a carnival and many  of the religious
 
meanings are  lost.
 At Senshin,  the festival is  small and many of
 
the rituals associated with Obon have
 been
 brought
 back.
 The
 
atmosphere is  reverent,  yet,
 very
 comfortable
 and accepting of
 
non-Buddhists.
 Japanese
 and
 Japanese-Americans
 from
 other
 
temples often  attend
 the
 Obon
 Festival
 at
 Senshin
 for
 this
 
reason.
 
Because  Senshin was one of the  first
 temples  in  the area  to
 
be  used as a hostel for
 Japanese-Americans
 returning
 from
 the
 
camps
 after
 World
 War
 II,
 the
 surrounding
 area
 became
 
predominantly Japanese-American.  Many of
 these
 families
 became
 
members of the  Senshin Buddhist
 Church,  The  1950's were the peak
 
period,  with as
 many
 as
 300
 students in the Gakuin and Dharma
 
School.  That number has  decreased
 to
 about
 60
 n o w.
 Reverend
 
Maseo Kodani,  one of the two reverends
 at  the church,  feels  that
 
the membership has leveled  off to a good number and he
 does
 not
 
see a need for  recruiting
 new
 members.
 He explained  that about
 
one third of  the Japanese-American community in
 Los
 Angeles
 is
 
interested  in learning
 about
 their cultural heritage,  one third
 
does not
 care,
 and
 the remaining third avoids it.
 The Senshin
 
Buddhist Church  would  rather have
 a  small
 group
 of
 sincerely
 
- 4 -
interested  members  than
 a  larger  group  of  uninterested  members.
 
The  general  feeling  among  the  congregation  is  that,  regardless  of
 
size,  the  spiritual  level  of  Senshin  is  at  a peak.

THE HISTORY OF THE SENSHIN BUDDHIST CHURCH[3]
 
The  Senshin  Buddhist  Church is located about  ten miles
 west
 
of downtown Los  Angeles.  It was  founded  in  1928 for  the expressed
 
purpose
 of
 teaching
 Japanese
 language,
 and,
 through
 the
 
establishment  of a Dharma School,
 to
 imbue in  the children,  the
 
teaching of  Shinran Shonin,  a  disciple
 of  Buddha and  the leader
 
of  the Jodo-Shinshu sect  of
 Buddhism.
 The
 tacit
 understanding
 
among the  families was that
 the
 superintendent
 of
 the
 school

 Wa s

downtown,  the convenience of a nearby  temple enabled
 Senshin
 to
 
grow quickly.
 With the ever-increasing enrollment of students,  a
 
critical need  for additional  facilities
 arose,
 and,
 in
 March,
 
1938,  the dedication of the  new classroom building was held.
 The
 
Gakuin was  formally
 incorporated
 as a non-profit corporation in
 
the State of California in  1938.
 
With the  bombing of Pearl Harbor
 on
 December
 7
,
 1941,
 a
 
special cabinet meeting was
 called
 to
 consider emergency steps

 The
 following information is paraphrased
 from
 the
 Senshin
 
Buddhist Churches

toward  the  continuance  of  the  Gakuin.  Botn  schools  were  suspended
 
indefinitely,
 toe
 Issei
 Board
 was
 dissolved
 and
 the
 
administrative  duties  were  delegated  to  the  Nisei  Corporate  Board
 
of  Directors.
 
The  Seashin  families,  with  the  exception  of
 those
 wh
 
evacuated  voluntarily,  were  first assembled  on May
 1,
 194
 
the  Santa Anita  Assembly  Center,  in Arcadia  California,  and
 th
 
sent  to  the  Granada  Relocation  Center  in  Amache,  Colorado.
 
The
 interior
 of  the  building was  placed  in  order
 and
 tde
 
exterior
 was
 boarded  for  security.
 Together,
 with
 the
 F
iompa
 
Hongwanji,  Senshin's care  was  entrusted
 to
 Reverend
 Julius
 A.
 
Goldwater,  a caucasian minister
 of
 the
 Jodo-Shinshu  sect.
 The
 
families  were
 able
 to  clear  the mortgage  on  the  Church  prior  to
 
World War  II,  enabling  all  to  evacuate  without  financial  worry.
 
Following
 VJ
 Day,
 August,  11,
 1945,
 Reverend
 Goldwater
 
converted  the  Gakuin  into  a hostel
 for
 the
 returning
 families
 
until  they were  able  to  find  accommodations.
 The
 Dharma
 School
 
was  reopened  immediately,  and,  in  response  to many  requests
 from
 
the members,  the  Gakuin was  also reopened.
 The  Senshin
 Buddhist
 
Church  became  independent  on May  1,  1951.  Because
 of  the  growing
 
Japanese and  Japanese-American population  in
 the
 area,
 it
 was
 
felt  that
 a  community  temple  could  better meet  the  needs  of  the
 
Sangha  (congregation).  Under  incorporation as  Senshin Gakuin,  the
 
membership  was  divided  into  Regular Members  (Nisei)  and Associate
 
Members  (Issei).
 Due
 to
 the
 Alien
 Land
 Law,
 the
 corporate
 
- 7 -
officers were  Nisei and  the  Board was comprised  of  Issei.
 
On September  21,  1963,
 the
 membership
 adopted a five-year
 
plan  to construct a  $250,000.00 religious-education complex plus
 
a  new
 Minister's residence.
 With the
 architectural
 plans
 of
 
Shimosono-Tawa  finalized
 and
 approved,
 construction
 be g an
 on
 
March  10,1965.  On May  1
,  1966,  38 years after  the  founding of  the
 
Gakuin,  Senshin's  facilities were capable of meeting the needs of
 
the 500 Dharma School  students,  150 Gakuin students
 and the many
 
octivtties of
 their
 affiliated
 organizations.
 All
 funds  for

 The

 will
 remain
 untouched,
 with only
 the
 
earnings

 to
 a)
 offset
 any
 operating
 deficit,
 b)
 
underwrite any extraordinary programs,  c)  establish
 scholarships
 
and d)  fund any programs  for  the wellbeing
 of
 the
 Sangha.  With
 
this Zaidan,  the
 temple
 currently
 finds
 itself
 in
 a  strong
 
position to meet  the needs of its Sarigha.

LEADERSHIP
 
There
 
are
 currently
 two Reverends
 at
 Senshin:
 Reverend
 
Hoshin
 Fujikado
 and Reverend Maseo Kodani  (Rev.  Mas,  as
 he
 is
 
called).
 Reverend
 Fujikado is Japanese and
 is
 most
 directly
 
involved with the Japanese  speaking members of  the church.
 He  is
 
also
 principal
 of
 the
 language
 school.
 Rev.
 Mas
 is
 
Japanese-American
 and
 works
 more
 closely
 with
 the
 English
 
speaking members of  the church.
 He
 is
 advisor
 to
 the
 Dharrria
 
School.  This combination
 of
 Japanese and Japanese-American  is a
 
positive
 force
 at
 Senshin
 Rev.
 Mas
 explained
 that
 many
 
Japanese-Americans carry with them a sense of being
 a  "national
 
embarrassment"  to Japan.  They look Japanese,  and,
 in
 many
 ways
 
act Japanese,
 but
 they no longer speak the language nor  do they
 
always
 understand
 their cultural make-up.
 This
 has
 caused
 a
 
barrier
 between
 the
 Japanese and
 Japanese-Americans
 in
 many
 
communities.
 Senshin
 tries to accommodate  the
 needs
 of
 both
 
groups.
 On
 Sunday
 morning,
 the
 service
 begins
 wtth
 51.
 
Reverends present.
 Just after
 Rev.
 Mas's
 sermon,  the Japanese
 
speaking
 members
 leave
 with
 Rev.  Fujikado to
 continue
 their
 
service in a small chapel
 behind
 the
 auditorium.
 The
 others
 
disperse  to  their  various Dharma classes.
 
Rev.  Mas's  sermon is a  very
 important part  of  the cultural

 Mr.  Inouye

The Gakuin  is  governed  by a Cabinet
 made  up of a Principal,
 
Head  Instructor,  Chairperson,  Assistants,  Treasurer,  and Advisor.
 
These  positions are  filled  by members of the Board.  The Board has
 
about 90 members,  30 to  35 of which are  very active.
 All
 major
 
decisions are  brought before
 the
 Board
 for
 discussion
 and
 a
 
ruling.
 Most adult members  of  the

in downtown Los Angeles.  The
 ASJLA
 sponsors
 conferences
 every

 area.
 The
 
purpose is  to
 discuss
 problems,  ideas and curriculum materials.
 
The teachers  determine what  should be included  in  the
 curriculum
 
materials
 and
 seek

Education Department.  Even so,  not all  the  teachers
 in
 Southern
 
California  follow  the  same  format.
 
There is another
 organizations
 which
 offers materials and
 
conferences
 for
 Japanese
 Language teachers
 called
 the
 Kyoto
 
System.  The Kyoto System requires that
 teachers
 be
 trained
 in
 
education.
 While  the teachers at
 Senshin
 are
 not
 trained
 in
 
education,  they
 can
 choose
 to go through a training program of
 
their
 
choice.
 Seminars

A key difference  between AJLSA
 and
 the  Kyoto System is  the
 
-

emphasis
 on
 
the
 various
 
written
 characters
 of  the
 Japanese
 
language.
 The  Kyoto System
 teaches  "katakana" characters  first,
 
then
 "hirakana"
 and,
 last,
 "kanji".
 "Katakana"
 is  used
 for
 
translating
 other  languages into Japanese,  "hirakana"  is
 common
 
Japanese and  ukanji!  is  the complex Chinese
 characters
 used
 in
 
formal
 communication.
 The
 AJLSA
 teaches
 "hirakana"
 first,
 
"katakana"
 second
 and
 intersperses
 a  few
 "kanji"
 from
 the
 
beginning.
 One
 might
 infer
 that
 teaching
 "katakana"
 first
 
emphasizes  the  use of Japanese
 as
 a second  language rather  than
 
as a first
 language
 
language teachers.
 
-
 a  major
 
consideration
 among
 Japanese
 
This consideration is  further  reflected
 in
 the
 choice
 of
 
curriculum materials.
 In  the
 past,
 the
 instructors used  books
 
that were printed and published in Japan.  Now,
 however,  they u
 
books that are  developed  in the
 United
 States.
 Although
 the
 
books are  "much easier"  than  those developed  in Japan,  Mr.  Inouye
 
feels  they are  useful  because they reflect
 American
 ideals
 and
 
"seem to fit
 these
 kids
 better."
 The newer  books do not have
 
much information about Japanese culture
 and
 tradition,
 a  fact
 
that Mr.  Inouye  seems to regret.
 But,
 he  feels the students are
 
better able
 to
 learn
 the language with these  books.
 The  books
 
are accompanied  by
 workbooks
 which have exercises to complement
 
each section
 
in
 the
 textbook.
 Ms.  Ono only gives the students
 
one-half hour of homework from the workbook.
 The
 Kyoto
 System
 
requires much
 more
 homework
 and asks the parents  to help their
 
children.
 Ms.  Ono feels  this  is
 not
 constructive
 because
 the
 
-
 13 -
 
parents end up  doing most  of  the homework and  the children do  not
 
learn.
 Even so,  both teachers feel  the children
 forget all  they
 
have  learned  during the week.
 
Both teachers  design  their own  tests and
 the
 students
 are
 
graded on
 an
 ABC scoring  basis.
 Mr.  Inouye also  designs a test
 
each year  for  the high school  students
 who wish to receive their
 
language credit  in Japanese.  The test is approved by Dr. Kumizuko
 
at  the University of Southern California
 
While 1

upper  level classes at  Senshin for  21  years.
 In  1982 he
 had
 20
 
students,
 
thirteen
 girls
 and
 seven
 boys.
 Three
 students
 
graduated  from the class in June so his classes will remain about
 
the  same size.
 
The
 Gakuin
 classes
 meet
 every
 Saturday
 from 8:30am
 to
 
12:30pm,  September  through the middle of
 June.
 The
 morning
 is
 
divided into four  50 minute  periods
 with
 a  ten
 minute
 recess
 
between each period.
 The subjects  include conversation,  reading,
 
writing,  meaning,  and composition.
 Ms.  Ono begins each day
 with
 
conversation,  or  a new subject,  because  she
 feels
 the
 children
 
are most awake  and  alert at  that hour.
 During  the  second  period,
 
the  focus  is on  reading,  meaning,  and  translation.
 For the  third
 
period
 they
 concentrate
 on
 writing
 single
 characters
 and,
 
occasionally,  composition.
 Composition
 is
 very
 difficult
 for
 
children at  this age so it is kept  to
 a  minimum.
 Because
 the
 
children tend  to  be tired and hungry by
 the
 fourth
 period,  Ms.
 
Ono
 likes
 to involve them in some cultural  traditions
 such
 as
 
origami,
 folktales,
 or
 painting.
 These
 are
 more
 enjoyable
 
learning tools and will hold  the children's attention.
 She  tries
 
to conduct  these  periods entirely in Japanese.
 
Mr.  Inouye
 follows a similar pattern.
 However,  rather  than
 
the cultural  traditions in  the  fourth period,
 
he  gives a test  in
 
the
 second
 period
 on
 a  recent
 lesson.
 The  third  period
 is
 
devoted to
 reading
 and  the  fourth,  to writing.
 In the  past,  he
 
included
 lessons about  Japanese culture,  especially  folk
 dance,
 
-
 15  -
 
but,  now Rev.  Mas includes  so much of  that in  the
 Dharma
 School
 
that  it is not essential  to  include in the language  school.
 This
 
reflects
 the
 complementary
 nature
 of the two
 programs.
 Mr.
 
Inouye does occasionally  tell stories and show films
 about
 life
 
in Japan.  His  focus,  however,
 is
 conversation.
 Both
 teachers
 
feel that,  while reading
 and
 writing
 are
 valuable,
 the
 most
 
important aspect of  learning the language is
 
conversation
 -
 to
 
proper
 pronunciation.
 They seem to
 
ope:ik comfortably and with
  
ortant for students
 returning to Japan
 
the
 Issei
 than
 for
 continuing
 and
 
aintaining the  language in the United States 0Ms.
 Ono
 expressed
 
he  feeling that  since the  students
 are
 Japanese,
 they
 should
 
speak
 Japanese.
 In general,  the students
 read
 and
 understand
 
Japanese  better  than  they  speak it.
 
Again,  the  issue of Japanese
 as
 a first  or  second language
 
is important
 in
 terms of  the  format of the classes.
 Years ago,
 
when the Nisei  were learning Japanese
 in
 order
 to
 communicate
 
with their  family,
 the
 classes
 focused
 on
 grammar
 and
 were
 
conducted entirely in Japanese.  Mr.  Inouye
 said
 he
 would
 "get
 
mad"
 at
 the  students for  using English in  the
 classroom.
 One
 
former student could  remember  the
 smack
 of  the ruler across  the
 
knuckles  for  such an offense.
 Today,
 however,
 the
 third
 and
 
fourth
 generation
 students
 require
 a  different
 method
 of
 
teaching.
 As
 Ms.
 Ono
 explained,
 it
 is
 important
 that
 the
 
teachers speak
 English
 in order  to be able  to  explain things  to
 
the students.
 
-
 16 -
 
I strongly  believe  you  have to communicate  with  the
 
children  first,  then you  teach Japanese to  them.[4]
 
She also  feels  it  is
 essential
 to  build  a positive  relationship
 
with  the
 students
 in order  to spark their  interest.
 The  use of
 
both  languages  seems  to create
 a  more  relaxed  atmosphere  in  the
 
classroom than  was  evident  in  the  past.
 
The classrooms
 are  very much like  public  school  classrooms,
 
with
 rows
 of  desks,  chairs,  large  blackboards  on  two
 walls,
 a
 
bulletin board  on  the back
 wall,
 and
 cabinets
 of
 bookshelves
 
under the windows on the  fourth
 wall.
 Textbooks
 and
 students
 
records
 are
 kept
 in
 a small  room
 adjacent
 to
 Mr.
 Inouye's
 
classroom.
 The
 walls are  decorated with
 posters
 from
 Japan,
 
lists of  "kanji",  a small  shrine with a  drawing
 of
 the Buddha,
 
and  artwork created by  the  students.
 The  bookshelves are
 filled
 
with
 Japanese
 children's magazines,  art  supplies
 and
 Japanese
 
toys.
 
In
 Ms.
 Ono's class,  a few tables are  pulled
 together
 and
 
they all  sit  in  a circle.
 It  has  the  feeling of a school  sessi
 
one
 might
 experience in  the home,  with a feeling
 of
 love
 and
 
caring
 between
 the teacher and students.
 In fact,  one
 of
 the
 
students
 is
 Ms.
 Ono's
 child.
 These
 younger
 students
 seem
 
sincerely interested in what  they
 are
 learning.
 There
 is
 no
 
pressure  placed  on  the students to participate closely
 with

other  students.
 Yet,  they  all are attentive.
 
Mr.
 Inouye's
 class
 was
 a  bit
 different.
 The
 students
 
practice among  themselves while Mr.  Inouye moves  from
 one
 level
 
to  the other,  working individually
 with
 the
 students
 in
 each
 
level.
 Occasionally,
 all  the students listen
 while
 each
 one
 
recites from his or her
 reading
 book.
 In general,  the students
 
seem to enjoy working together.

evident.
 
Again,  the complementary nature of  the  two programs  is
 
The Senshin
 Gakuin culminates each year with the  graduation
 
ceremony held
 
in
 the
 Auditorium of the temple complex.
 In the
 
past,  they
 also
 held
 a speech contest,  but recently,  the class
 
has not been large enough to continue  that  tradition.
 Today,  the
 
graduation ceremony combines  the two.
 
With the
 exception
 of
 a  few
 moments,
 the
 ceremony
 is
 
conducted entirely  in Japanese.  The program is  divided
 into
 two
 
parts.
 During  the  first half,  the students
 sit  in rows with  the

a Japanese  flag hang on the wall behind them.
 The ceremony opens
 
with the Star
 Spangled
 Banner  (in English).  Graduation Diplomas
 
and Perfect Attendance Awards are
 given
 out at  this time.
 Each
 
student walks  up on the  stage
 alone and  receives  the award and  a
 
gift  from the members of
 the
 Cabinet.  Next,  advice and memories
 
are exchanged  between the  graduates
 and
 the
 younger
 students.
 
These

 speeches

For  the  second half  of
 the
 ceremony,  the  students  take  the
 
stage and,
 one
 by one,  recite or  read from their reading books.
 
It is interesting to note that  the  student's performance
 follows
 
the
 awarding
 of
 Diplomas.
 This
 suggests
 that  the
 student's
 
success is not contingent upon the performance at
 the
 ceremony.
 
Instead,
 because
 every
 student
 performs
 in
 Japanese,
 every
 
student is honored for his or her  progress.
 This year,  Ms.  Ono's
 
class recited,  from memory,
 a  Japanese
 folktale.

Initially,
 Japanese 
was
 taught
 to
 children
 because
 
parents  thought  they would  be  returning  to Japan and wanted  their
 
children to
 maintain
 their
 proficiency.
 The
 next  generation
 
taught  their  children so  they  could communicate
 with
 the
 Issei
 
and Nisei.  Now,  the language is taught  so
 the
 children
 will  be
 
able to aid  the United States in maintaining
 good  relations with
 
Japan.  Another  reason expressed by both parents and
 children
 is
 
that Japanese  can satisfy  the  student's  language requirement.
 
In many  cases,  the  parents  do not  speak
 Japanese.  They  grew
 
up
 at
 a time  when most
 Japanese-Americans
 were
 demonstrating
 
their  loyalty  to  the
 United
 States.
 Consequently,  few Japanese
 
traditions were  emphasized  in the home.
 For
 those who did go  to
 
a language school,  the classes were  very
 strict.
 Most
 parents
 
and  teachers agree  that  the
 looser
 
today's children.
 
format  is more  effective  for
 
Despite these motivations,
 Mr.
 Inouye
 occasionally
 feels
 
like he
 is
 "babysitting."
 
He  feels  the parents merely dr
 
children off,  come
 back
 four
 hours
 later,
 and
 do not
 
express an interest
 in
 their child's progress.
 Obviously,  this
 
attitude can also be  found  in
 the public schools,  and  is not  the
 
attitude of all  parents.
 Nonetheless,  Mr.  Inouye  feels  there are
 
many  things the children would  rather
 be
 doing
 on
 a  Saturday
 
morning.
 
-
 21  -
 
Ms.  Ono  also  expressed  her  sorrow  that  the  children
 
•
 .
 .hate  to  go  to  Japanese  school.
 Even my  kids,  they
 
always  (sic)  complaining.
 That  hurting  (sic)  me  a
 
lot. [5]
 
However,  a student
 overhearing
 this  conversation  shook her  head
 
in  disagreement.
 
Despite  these  feelings,  the  children  do
 not
 seem
 to
 mind
 
going  to  the  language  school.
 They may  complain
 about  it  before
 
they  get  there,  but
 once
 there,
 they  seem to  have a good  time.
 
Most  of
 them
 are  there  because their  parents want  them to  learn
 
Japanese.  They  are  not  sure  why
 and,
 when
 asked,
 they
 appear
 
apathetic.
 
Since  I'm  Japanese,  I guess  they  want me  to  learn
 
Japanese  so  if  I go  to  Japan,  I can  talk  to  my
 
relatives. •

Another  student...
 
Well,  I don't know,  I don't  remember,  ur
n  (sic),
 I
 
remember my
 mom
 said,
 like,  when I was  little,  all  I
 
did was  talk
 Japanese.
 But,
 then,
 when
 I  went
 to
 
school,  I forgot everything cuz  (sic)  everyone else was
 
speaking English.  She said  if  I remembered  it,
 then
 I
 
wouldn't have to come,  but,  then,  I didn't  remember
 it
 
so  I have  to come.. .
[7]
 
Because  the  students attend  both  the  Senshin  Gakuin and
 the
 
Dharma School,  they know each other
 well.
 Some
 of
 the
 older
 
students see  each other at  public school  but,  because they are  in
 
different grades,  they do not  spend much
 time
 together.
 There
 
are a few pairs  who are  best  friends.
 The  junior  and  senior  high
 
schools  in  the area are
 culturally
 integrated
 so
 the
 Senshin
 
students have  friends from a variety of cultural  backgrounds.
 In
 
fact,  several of  them expressed an interest in
 learning
 Spanish
 
more  than Japanese.  A few have  friends at other Japanese language
 
schools
 as
 well as  friends who go  to Hebrew
 school.
 However,
 
they rarely share their language
 school
 experiences
 except
 to
 
teach each other  the usual  four-letter words.
 
Given an opportunity  to make
 
any
 changes
 in
 the
 Senshin
 
Gakuin,  the  first concern is  to increase enrollment.
 There  is a
 
feeling
 that,
 as
 parents
 
with
 young
 children
 renew
 their
 
involvement with Senshin,  enrollment will
 
increase.
 Currently,
 
the church has affiliated organizations  for all age groups exce l,
 
the  25-35  year
 olds.
 Consequently,

But,  as  their  children  begin

the  church,  becoming active  in  the  Adult  Buddhist  Association.
 
Another  desired  change  expressed
 particularly  by Mr.  Inouye
 
concerns  the  lack
 of
 conversational
 ease
 on
 the
 part  of  the
 
students.
 He  would  like  to  add  a language
 class
 that
 would  be
 
strictly Japanese  conversation.
 This  kind  of  class  might  also  be
 
offered  for  adults.
 
A final  concern  expressed  by
 the
 students  is  to  update  the
 
books  so  they  are  not  so  "corny" and
 "boring."
 This
 might  make
 
the  class more  enjoyable,  thus  improving  comprehension.
 
In  summary,
 although
 the
 Senshin
 Gakuin
 has  experienced
 
major
 fluctuations
 in
 enrollment,
 it  is  still
 considered
 an
 
important
 means
 for
 this
 Japanese-American
 community
 to
 
understand,  maintain,  and  enhance  its  sense  of  identity.

THE SENSHIN DHARMA SCHOOL
 
Like  the  Senshin Gakuin,  the  Senshin
 Dharrna
 School
 has
 a
 
Cabinet responsible  for making major  decisions.
 
They meet once a
 
month
 with
 all
 the
 teachers
 to
 discuss the program for
 the
 
upcoming two months.
 Although the teachers are allowed
 quite
 a
 
bit  of
 freedom
 in
 planning  their classes,  these meetings are a
 
means
 for
 maintaining a meaningful and
 cohesive
 program.
 No
 
tuition is charged to the  students.
 Instead,
 the
 parents
 are
 
asked
 to
 make
 a  donation
 to
 the
 Dharma
 School
 annually.
 
Occasionally,  the Dharma School
 will
 have
 a fundraising  event,
 
within the church.
 The various affiliated groups  will also
 have
 
fundraisers to support  their  activities.
 
The  teachers
 for
 the
 Dharma School are all members  of  the
 
church.
 They  teach entirely  on a volunteer  basis and all of  them
 
have
 been
 through Dharma School,  many
 at
 Senshin.
 Currently,
 
there are  fourteen teachers.
 They range in age  from seventeen  to
 
fifty,  and in  experience  from two
 to
 thirty
 years.
 When
 the
 
Dharma School  first began,  pre-World War
 II,
 the
 teachers
 all
 
held  jobs as
 public
 school
 teachers.
 That was one of the  few
 
jobs that Japanese women could have
 at  the time,  and most  of  the
 
Dharma School  teachers were women.
 The traditional arts
 at
 the
 
church were also taught by women,  usually
 the
 Reverend's
 wife.
 
-
 25  -
 
She was  trained  in  these  arts
 and
 was
 responsible
 for
 flower
 
arranging and  food preparation  for
 all
 the
 services.
 In
 the
 
past,  all  the classes,  whether  religious or artistic,
 were
 very
 
structured.
 Students were required to stand and  repeat
 a  mor
 
code
 when
 the
 teacher
 entered
 the
 classroom.
 The
 
consisted
 of
 formal
 lectures
 about  the  various
 teach
 
Buddhism.  For  the most part,  the
 teachings
 were
 repeated
 each
 
year
 but
 with
 greater
 detail
 and
 depth as  the  students
 got
 
older.
 Little attention was  directed
 toward
 other
 aspects
 of
 
Japanese life.
 This  format  continued  until after  the war.
 
Today's  Dharma
 School  is  quite  different.
 The classes meet
 
for
 about an hour and
 a  half
 each
 Sunday
 in
 the
 classroom
 
building
 of
 the
 temple
 complex.
 The
 students
 are
 divided
 
according
 to
 age,  with each level
 having
 a  Japanese-Buddhist
 
name.
 There is also an adult
 study class that meets at  the  same
 
time on Sunday
 and
 again
 on
 Wednesday
 evenings
 in
 members'
 
homes.
 The classes are  very  informal,  with many  of  them focusing
 
on specific  projects.
 
The teachers are not  required to have any
 formal
 
yet,  a knowledge of Buddhism and  the
 desire to explore
 
Buddhist
 philosophy
 with
 the
 children
 are
 
qualifications.
 
training,
 
and  share
 
preferred
 
All
 the
 classes
 are taught in
 English.
 The
 
Buddhist
 Churches
 of
 America
 (BCA)
 offers
 conferences
 and
 
workshops for any interested  teachers.
 These are held  throughout
 
the year,  guiding teachers  in  the presentation of materials,
 and
 
offering an opportunity  to share ideas.
 There is
 also an annual
 
-
 26 -
 
conference  for  the
 Young
 Buddhist Association where high  school
 
and  college students can
 interact with other Japanese-Americans.
 
One teacher expressed  the  feeling
 that
 these
 conferences
 have
 
taken on a predominantly
 social
 characteristic
 over  the  years.
 
She  feels  sorrow that an opportunity  to share religious  ideas has
 
become more of a social event,  but agrees that  it  is,  perhaps,  as
 
important for  the students  to
 interact
 comfortably
 with
 other
 
Japanese-American  Buddhists.
 
The BCA,  headquartered  in
 San
 Francisco,
 publishes a wide
 
variety of  educational materials
 for  Buddhist organizations.
 As
 
a member of
 the
 BCA,
 the
 Senshin Dharma School  is entitled  to
 
these materials  free of charge.
 They,
 in turn,  pass them along
 
to
 the
 students.
 However,
 the Senshin Buddhist
 Church
 also
 
publishes a variety of  service  books and is
 currently working on
 
a  history
 of  the altar in  their temple.
 In
 fact,
 the
 church
 
complex includes a
 
large
 Library/Information
 Center  located  in
 
the classroom building.
 The room
 has
 several
 shelves
 stacked
 
with books about a wide variety of belief  systems,  photographs  of
 
all-  past
 Reverends,  a counter  covered
 with
 several
 hand-made
 
objects,  a glass
 case
 containing various religious objects  used
 
in
 the
 service,  and a counter  for  flyers and
 announcements
 of
 
upcoming community events.
 The table
 in
 the middle of the  room
 
is
 currently
 piled
 high
 with
 research
 materials
 for
 the
 
publication on  the altar.
 
In the  past,  the curriculum materials  from the  BCA have  been
 
in pamphlet  form and have  fo cused
 almost
 entirely
 on
 Buddhist
 
-
 27  -
 
teachings.
 Recently,  the
 Dharma
 School  received  the new DHARMA
 
SCHOOL TEACHERS  GUIDE from the BCA.  It is
 in
 notebook
 form and
 
has  433 pages of  guidelines  for teaching Buddhism.
 The
 subjects
 
include
 traditional
 and
 
non-traditional
 arts,
 
ideas
 for
 
conducting
 family
 histories
 and
 exploring
 one's
 self,
 and
 
approaches  to  the many American and Buddhist holidays.
 
Many  significant
 changes have  occurred  in  the  Dharma School
 
over  the past  fourteen years.
 In fact,
 Rev.  Mas  feels  that many
 
of
 the
 changes
 would
 not  have  been
 possible
 at
 most
 other
 
temples.
 Perhaps  the most  drastic,  and  the one most  difficult  to
 
accept,  involves  the  best  time  to teach the Buddhist Doctrines  to
 
the children.
 There are two
 schools
 of thought.
 Some  feel  the
 
Doctrines should  be taught  from
 the
 beginning and  to wait  until
 
the children are older is a waste of valuable time.
 Rev.  Mas,
 
the
 other
 hand,
 believes
 that
 children
 will  understand
 t
 
Doctrines
 better
 if
 they
 can
 apply
 them
 to
 practical
 
experiences.
 He explained  that enlightenment can be quite brutal
 
because it is achieved through
 egolessness.
 One
 must
 have
 a
 
healthy ego in order  to throw it away.
 For this  reason,
 he
 has
 
introduced  several  programs  to help members,  both young and
 old,
 
develop a stronger sense of identity in
 order to  prepare for  the
 
process
 of
 enlightenment.
 He
 feels
 it
 is
 important
 that
 
Japanese-Americans understand  their
 Japanese,
 as
 well as their
 
American background.
 Bi-cultural identity  -
can be quite painful,
 
especially
 for
 young
 adults.
 They
 need
 to
 be
 exposed
 to
 
recognizable
 cultural
 traditions
 as
 well
 as
 those
 hidden
 
-
 28 -
 
traditions,  such as
 relationships
 within  the  family unit,  which
 
contribute  to  one's personality,
 Rev.
 Mas's
 goal
 is
 to
 help
 
Japanese-Americans
 feel
 comfortable
 with
 their
 bi-cultural
 
identity.
 
The Dharma
 School  programs reflect  this  goal.
 The  students
 
are
 involved
 in
 batik,
 researching
 family
 crests,
 haiku,
 
vedeotaping major
 church
 events,
 self-portraits,
 as
 well as,
 
examining Buddhist Doctrines.  Each student is also a member of  an
 
affiliated  social  groups
 within
 the church which offers  several
 
opportunities  for
 
interaction.
 The adult study  classes offer  an
 
opportunity for  adults to learn about  their heritage
 and
 become
 
better able to  encourage and explore  it with their  children.
 One
 
particular
 class
 focused
 on
 the many difference
 between
 the
 
Japanese and
 
the
 Chinese,
 as can be  found in  their literature.
 
The adults  seemed very attentive and  showed much
 recognition
 of
 
the characteristics illustrated.
 Again,
 Rev.  Mas related  things
 
to
 everyday
 living.
 For example,  to
 illustrate
 the
 Japanese
 
preference for odd numbers  versus the Chinese preference for  even
 
numbers,
 he
 asked how one might
 arrange
 four
 chrysanthemums.
 
Most of
 them
 agreed they would remove one or add another  before
 
they could arrange it.
 
The
 Kinnara
 Taiko drum group and
 the
 Gagaku
 traditional
 
court
 music
 group
 are
 also  important activities
 for
 adults.
 
Participants range in age  from seventeen to fifty and  include men
 
and women.
 There
 is
 also
 a  Taiko
 group
 for  younger people.
 
Members often  bring  their  children  to  the Gagaku group classes  to
 
-
 29 -
 
expose them
 
to
 the
 tradition,  and  its  strange  sounds.
 As  Rev.
 
Mas
 explained,
 if his daughter  chooses not  to hold
 on
 to
 her
 
Japanese identity,
 that
 is her choice.
 But  "I want her  to know
 
what  she
 is
 throwing
 away."
 Because of the method of  training
 
for the Taiko and Gagaku groups,  it
 is often difficult  for  young
 
people
 
to
 maintain
 involvement
 for  long.
 The
 philosophy
 of
 
e
 g olessness
 
is
 predominant.
 
Members are encouraged  to learn all
 
the  instruments  and all  their
 parts,
 but
 little
 reinforcement
 
(whether
 positive
 or
 negative)
 
is  given.
 The
 
experience
 is
 
viewed as a kind  of microcosm for  understanding  the  philosophy  of
 
Buddhism as
 well
 as
 the
 realities
 of
 everyday
 life.
 This
 
interrelationship between
 cultural
 traditions
 and
 beliefs
 is
 
characteristic  of  Senshin,  as  is  this method of  teaching.
 
An important aspect of
 these
 two
 musical
 groups
 
is
 the
 
element
 of
 tradition.
 On
 the
 one
 hand,  the  oldest form
 of
 
orchestral music
 in
 the
 world  is being preserved  by  the Gagaku
 
group  (the newest piece was written in 900AD).  On  the other hand,
 
the Taiko group combines the  experiences of Japanese-Americans  in
 
Los.  Angeles
 with the tradition.
 African,
 Latino,
 and
 Native
 
American rhythms are combined with
 jazz,
 rhythm
 &  blues,
 and
 
traditional  forms  in each presentation.
 Rev.  Mas  explains
 
You preserve it,  and  then you have something  else,
 
so,  each time,
 you
 add  something.
 The Japanese never
 
throw it away.
 They always  just
 add
 to
 it.
 That's
 
what we want  to  do.
 We want  to say  that  if  a new form
 
comes,  it  doesn't replace  the old.[8]

 Buddhist
 Church,

This  idea was  expressed
 beautifully
 in
 a  performance
 by
 the
 
Sanghateens  (the  junior
 high
 school affiliate  group)  which  they
 
designed for  their  teacher
 as
 a  bridal
 shower
 present.
 The
 
dancers wore  traditional
 kimonos
 and  samurai  dress and  executed
 
many  traditional  steps.
 But  they danced  to  disco  played
 through
 
a cassette tape  player.
 
The
 Senshin
 congregation
 
seems
 to
 
have
 responded
 
enthusiastically  to the new programming.
 As
 with
 all
 change,
 
reactions were mixed,  initially.
 Even now,  some
 feel
 that
 the
 
cultural
 traditions
 have
 taken precedent
 over
 the
 religious
 
teachings.
 Perhaps,  more  balance is needed.
 Yet,  this need
 for
 
balance may be
 more
 closely
 related
 to a need  for o
 
diverse programming lends an air of disorder.
 Dharma
 t
 
longer has
 the
 format of school.
 One  student  said  that  they do
 
not have regular
 classes
 
"it
 seems
 more
 like hobbies."
 A
 
teacher expressed  frustration  that  she was not able  to fit all  of
 
her  religious lessons into this  year's  schedule
 because
 of
 the
 
many cultural  programs.
 
Reactions  to  the new DHARMA SCHOOL TEACHER"S GUIDE are
 also
 
varied.
 While most of the  teachers
 feel  that  the new GUIDE is a
 
welcomed change,  they indicated  that  it  probably will not be  used
 
much
 at
 Senshin.  Rev.  Mas  said he would probably
 refer
 to
 it
 
occasionally for  a good story  to include in a sermon,  but  that  it
 
is  too structured  for the current Dharma
 School
 teaching
 staff
 
and programs.
 Terry
 Nakatawase,
 a  teacher
 who
 has
 been
 as
 
-
 31  -
 
Senshin
 for
 30
 years,
 said
 that
 the most  productive way
 to
 
utilize the GUIDE would  be to  offer workshops to all the teachers
 
to acquaint  them with all  the  possibilities of  the GUIDE.
 
The GUIDE has not  yet  been implemented
 in  the classes  so  it
 
is difficult  to  know what  the students  reactions will be.
 The  do
 
seem to be responsive to the increased
 cultural
 activities
 and
 
are  now getting  involved  in  conducting oral
 histories
 with
 the
 
Issei
 
Perhaps  the  best assessment
 of
 the
 value
 of
 the
 Dharma
 
School comes  from one student who explained  that
 her
 girlfriend
 
invited her to church one
 day and  she has  been coming on her own
 
ever  since.
 She is only fourteen and,  because the atmosphere has
 
something
 special
 to
 offer
 her,
 she
 has made the choice
 to
 
continue to attend.
 
The
 Senshin
 Buddhist Church,  although uniq
 
California in  1982,  is not unique in the history
 
of
 people
 throughout  the world.
 The church has always
 been
 a
 
central meeting  ground for  immigrant groups as
 they
 arrived
 on
 
foreign soil.
 For
 many,  the church was  the only  tie with their
 
homeland,
 culture,
 and
 language.
 The
 church
 brought
 people
 
together
 and
 gave them a sense of identity and
 security
 in
 a
 
strange
 environment.
 Over
 the  years,
 however,
 as
 immigrant
 
groups began to  feel more comfortable in
 American
 society,
 the
 
church  became  less  important as a cultural center.
 At
 Senshin,
 
the  bond  between belief and  culture is,  once
 again,
 reinforced.
 
-
 32  -
 
And  for  many,  this  bond  gives  them  strength

History of the Senshin Buddhist Church
 
The Senshin Buddhist Church is located about ten miles west of
 
downtown Los Angeles. It was founded in 1
928 for the express purpose of
 
teaching the Japanese language and conveying the teaching of Shinran
 
Shonin, a disciple of Buddha and the leader of the Jodo-Shinshu sect of
 
Buddhism. There are two distinct and on-going school programs at
 
Senshin: the Senshin Gakuin, a Japanese language school, and the
 
Senshin Dharma School, a Japanese Buddhist study school.
 
Because the Hompa Hongwanji (main temple) was located downtown,
 
Senshin grew quickly, offering as it did the convenience of proximity.
 
A critical need for additional facilities arose with the increased
 
enrollment of students which resulted. The dedicatjon of
 ne
 
classroom building took place in March 1
938. The Gakuin was formally
 
incorporated as a non-profit corporation in the State of California the
 
same year. The establishing families were able to clear the mortgage on
 
the church in the closing years of the 1
930s.
 
With the bombing of Pearl Harbor on December 7
, 1
941 a special
 
cabinet meeting was called to consider emergency steps required for the
 
continuance of the Gakuin; however, both schools were suspended
 
indefinitely. The Senshin families, with the exception of those who had
 
evacuated voluntarily, were assembled on May 1
, 1
942 at the Santa Anita
 
Assembly Center in Arcadia, California and sent to the Granada
 
2
 
Relocation Center in Amache, Colorado. The interior of the church
 
building was straightened up and the exterior was boarded for security.
 
Senshin's care, together with responsibility for the main temple, was
 
entrusted to the Reverend Julius A
. Goldwater, a caucasian minister of
 
the Jodo-Shinshu sect.
 
Following VJ )
ay —August 1
1, 1
945--the Reverend Mr. Goldwater
 
converted the Gakuin into a hostel for the returning families until
 
they were able to find accomodations. The Dharma School was reopened
 
immediately; in response to many requests from the church members, the
 
Gakuin was also reopened.
 
The Senshin Buddhist Church became independent on May 1
, 1
951.
 
Because of the growing Japanese and Japanese-American population in the
 
area, it was felt that a community temple could better meet the needs
 
of the sangha (congregation). According to the terms of incorporation
 
for the Senshin Gakuin, the church membership was divided into regular
 
members who are second-generation Japanese-Americans (nisei) and
 
associate members who are first-generation Japanese Americans (
issei). 
The corporate officers were nisei and the board was comprised of issei. 
On September 2
1,  1
963 the church membership adopted a five-year
 
plan to construct a $250,000 religious-education complex and a new
 
minister's residence. Construction began on March 10,  1965, using
 
architectural plans submitted by Shimosono-Tawa. On May 1
, 1
966,
 
thirty-eight years after the founding of the Gakuin, Senshin's
 
facilities were capable of meeting the needs of 500 Dharma School
 
3
 
students and 1
50 Gakuin students, and of housing the many activities of
 
their affiliated organizations. All construction costs over the years
 
have been paid by the churci  membership.
 
A twenty-year, $
25O,00u trust fund (
zaidan) was established in
 
------as
 
a commemorative project, to insure the economic sustenance
 
the congregation. The principle is to remain untouched; the earning
 
are to be used to offset any operating deficit, underwrite
 
extraordinary programs, establish scholarships, and fund projects for
 
the well-being of the congregation. Due to the trust fund, the temple
 
currently finds itself in a strong position to meet the needs of its
 
congregation.
 
Church Leadership
 
There are currently two reverends at Senshin: the Reverend Hoshin
 
Fujikado and the Reverend Maseo Kodani (
"Rev. Mas" as he is called).
 
The Reverend Mr. Fujikado is Japanese and is tk6 most directly involved
 
c)
 
with the Japanese-speaking members of the church. He is also principal
 
of the Gakuin. Rev. Mas is Japanese-American and works more closely
 
with the English-speaking members of the church. He is advisor to the
 
Dharma School. The combination of Japanese and Japanese-American
 
leadership appears to be a positive force at Senshin.
 
4
 
Rev. Mas explained that many Japanese-Americans carry with them a
 
sense of being a "national embarrassment" to Japan. They look Japanese
 
and, in many ways, act Japanese; but they no longer speak the language,
 
nor do they always understand their cultural make-up. This has caused a
 
barrier between the Japanese a
ria Japanese-Americans in many
 
communities. Senshin tries to accomodate the needs of both groups. On
 
Sunday morning the service begins with both reverends present. Just
 
after Rev. Mas's sermon, the Japanese-speaking members leave with the
 
Reverend Mr. Fujikado to continue their service in a small chapel
 
behind the auditorium. The other church members disperse to their
 
various Dharma classes.
 
Rev. Mas's sermon is a very important part of the cultural
 
enlightenment offered at Senshin. He begins talking about some p
Liy L i1
 
aspect of Buddhism (bells, flowers, or batik), explaining not only how
 
it relates to Buddhism, but also how it relates to everyday life. He
 
also relays a story, either from his experiences in Japan or from the
 
storehouse of traditional tales and myths surrounding Buddhism. These
 
sermons are told in a very story-like manner. In fact,  "sermon" seems
 
an inappropriate word. Rev. Mas has the ability and desire to transmit
 
to the listeners an increased understanding of their own
 
personalities. As a leader he has initiated many of the changes at
 
Senshin which have enabled the members to explore their cultural
 
identity.
 
5
 
The Senshin Gakuin currently teaches Japanese to approximately
 
twenty-five students, aged five through sixteen.  At its peak
 
enrollment ran as high as 150. Most of the Japanese and
 
Japanese-Americans who lived in the area have moved away in the past
 
ten years, however. They still return L
 Li
 t
ir h r r
 t
1
 
Sundays, but prefer to send their chiiJr n r
j  I 
to home. There are at least four otiler Japanese language schools in t
 
Los Angeles area. That fact indicates that interest in maintaining the
 
language is still high. Yet, the area surrounding Senshin has changed
 
from Japanese to S±aek, causing a decrease in local interest in
 
O 
learning Japanese. In fact, the school has considered folding twice,
 
but the members decided to continue.
 
The Senshin Gakuin does not pay rent or overhead. The church
 
donates the space to the Gakuin. The students pay a monthly fee of $12,
 
which covers the books and the honorarium paid to the teachers. Any
 
unforeseen expenses are covered by the church.
 
Senshin Gakuin -
 School Administration
 
The Gakuin is governed by a cabinet made up of
 principal, head
 
instructor, chairperson, assistants, treasurer, and advisor. These
 
positions are filled by members of the board. The board has about
 
ninety members, thirty to thirty-five of whom are very active. All
 
major decisions are brought before the board for discussion and ruling.
 
Most adult members of the church are members of the board.

The Senshin Gakuin is also a member of the American Japanese
 
Language School Association (AJLSA), which is part of the Buddhist
 
Churches of America and is headquartered at the Hompa Hongwanji in
 
downtown Los Angeles.
 
Senshin Gakuin -
 Teachers
 
There are only two teachers: Sumiko Ono, who teaches first through
 
third grade, and Henry Inouye, who teaches fourth through nin
1th. Ms.
 
Ono began teaching Japanes
i
A
merica in 1
975 and has been teaching at
 
Senshin for two years  In 1982 she had four students —three girls and
 - 
one boy. Three of those students graduated to the upper level. Mr.
 
Inouye has been teaching the upper level classes at Senshin for
 
twenty-one years. Three students graduated from the class in June 1
982,
 
so his classes will remain about the same size. '
 
The AJLSA sponsors conferences every three months for teachers in
 
the Southern California area. The purpose is to discuss problems,
 
ideas, and curriculum materials. The teachers determine what should be

There is another organizati
ro
s
.ns which offers materials and
 
conferences for Japanese-language teachers called the Kyoto System.
 
The system requires that

in education, they can choose t

through a training program of their choice. S

year through both organizations.
 
A key difference between AJLSA and the Kyoto System i
s the
 
emphasis on the various written characters of the Japanese language.
 
The Kyoto System teaches katakana characters, used for translating
 
7
 
other languages into Japanese, first. The system then goes on t
o teach
 
hirakana, common Japanese writing , and kanji, the complex Chinese
 
characters used in formal communications.  The AJLSA teaches hirakana
  
f
irst and  katakana next, interspersing a few kanji words from the
 
beginning. One might infer that teaching katakana first emphasizes
 
the use of Japanese a
s a second language —a major consideration among
 
Japanese-language teachers.
 
The question of whether Japanese i
s taught a
s a first or second
 
language i
s further t
ref lect ed  in  the  choi ce
o
i
 curriculum. materials. In
 
the past,the instructors used books that were printed and published in
 
Japan. Now, however, they use  books that are developed
 
8
 
American ideals and "
seem to fit these kids better." The newer books
 
do not have much information about Japanese culture and tradition, a
 
fact that Mr. Inouye seems to regret. He feels the students are better
 
able to learn the language with these books, however.
 
The books are accompanied by workbooks which have exercises to
 
complement each section of the textbook. Ms. Ono only gives the
 
students one—half hour of homework from the workbook. The Kyoto System
 
requires much more homework and asks the parents to help their
 
children. Ms. Ono feels this is not constructive because the parent , 
end up doing most of the homework and the children do not learn. Ev
 
so, both teachers feel the children forget all they have learned during
 
the week.
 
Both teachers design their own tests and the students are graded on
 
an A,B,C scoring basis. Mr. Inouye also designs a test each year for
 
the high school students who wish to receive their language credit in
 
Japanese. The test is approved by Dr. Kumizuko at the University of
 
Southern California.
 
While Mr. Inouye closely follows the fo r maL  of  the books, Ms. Ono
 
prefers to combine the books from the United States with a book from
 
Japan. The books from the United States are very basic, teaching how to
 
count, tell time, order lunch, and so forth. They can get quite boring.
 
The book from Japan has stories about Japan, folktales, more grammar,
 
and more words. She explained that the book expresses more Japanese
 
9
 
f
eelings. For instance, the Japanese have many ways of describing the
 
beauty of a flower, each one expressing a different feeling. Ms. Ono
 
wants to teach those feelings to the children.
 
The students at the Senshin Gakuin are divided according t
o
 
proficiency. A student's grade level in the Gakuin many not always
 
correspond to his or her grade level in the regular school. It i
s rare
 
for a s
tudent to fail a Gakuin class.
 
The Gakuin classes meet every Saturday from 8
:30 A.M.  t
o 1
2:30
 
P
.M. from September through the middle of June. The morning is divided
 
in four fifty—minute periods, with a ten—minute recess between each
 
period. The subjects include conversation, reading, writing, meaning,
 
and composition.
 
1
s. Ono begins each day with conversation or a new subject
 
because she feels the children are most awake and alert at that hour.
 
During the second period the focus is on reading, meaning, and
 
translation. For the third period they concentrate on writing single
 
characters and, occasionally, composition. Composition is very
 
difficult for the children at this age, so it is kept to a minimum.
 
Because the children tend to be tired and hungry by the fourth period,
 
Ms. Ono likes to involve them in some cultural traditions, such as
 
origami, folktales, or painting, which are more enjoyable learning
 
tools and will hold the children's attention. She tries to conduct
 
these periods entirely in Japanese.
 
1

Mr. Inouye follows a similar pattern. He gives a t
est on a r
ecent
 
lesson in the second period. The third period is devoted to reading and
 
the fourth to writing. In the past he included lessons about Japanese
 
culture, especially folk dance, but Rev. Mas now includes so much of
 
that in the Dharma School that it is not essential to include it in the
 
language school. This reflects the complementary nature of the two
 
programs. Mr. Inouye occasionally tells stories and shows films about
 
life in Japan; his focus, however, is conversation. Both teachers feel
 
that, while reading and writing are valuable, the most important aspect
 
of learning the language is conversation —to speak comfortably with
 
proper pronunciation. They seem to feel that this is more important for
 
students returning to Japan and speaking with the first-generation
 
immigrants. It is also important for continuing and maintaining the
 
language in the United States. Ms. Ono expressed the feeling that,
 
since the students are Japanese, they should speak Japanese. In
 
general, the students read and understand Japanese better than they
 
speak it.
 
The issue of Japanese as a first or second language is important
 
in terms of the format of the classes as well. Years ago, when the
 
nisei were lea r
ning Japanese in order to communicate with their
 
family, the classes focused on grammar and were conducted entirely in
 
Japanese. Mr. Inouye said he would get mad at the students for using
 
English in the classroom. One former student could remember the smack
 
of the ruler across the knuckles for such an offense. Today, however,
 
the third- and fourth-generation students require a different method of
 
teaching. As Ms. Ono explained, it is important that the teachers speak
 
1
1
 
English in order to be able to explain things to the students. "I
 
strongly believe you have to communicate with the children first," she
 
says. "Then you teach Japanese to them." (ES82-AS-C8) She also feels it
 
is essential to build a positive relationship with the students in
 
order to spark their interest. The use of both languages seems to create
 
a more relaxed atmosphere in the classroom than was evident in the
 
past.
 
The classrooms are very much like public school classrooms, with
 
rows of desks, chairs, large blackboards on two walls, a bulletin board
 
on the back wall, and cabinets of bookshelves under the windows on the
 
fourth wall. Textbooks and students'  records are kept in a small room
 
adjacent to Mr. Inouye's classroom. The walls are decorated with
 
posters from Japan, lists of kanji, a small shrine with a drawing of
 
the Buddha, and artwork created by the students. The bookshelves are
 
filled with Japanese children's magazines, art supplies, and Japanese
 
toys.
 
In Ms. Ono's class a few tables are pulled together and they all
 
sit in a circle, giving the feeling of a school session one might
 
experience in the home. There is a feeling of love and caring between
 
the teacher and students. In fact, one of the students is Ms. Ono's
 
child. The younger students seem sincerely interested in what they are
 
learning. There is no pressure placed on the stu1ents to participate,
 
yet they are all attentive.
 
1
2
 
Mr. Inouye's class is a bit different. The students practice
 
among themselves while Mr. Inouye moves from one level to the other,
 
working individually with the students in each level. All the students
 
listen occasionally while each one recites from his or her reading
 
book. The students seem to enjoy working together. Mr. Inouye is
 
extremely helpful to the students, even while they are taking tests. He
 
seems genuinely concerned about their success. Tae students call him
 
sensei, which means teacher or wise one. Each class begins and ends
 
with a traditional bow of respect.
 
Both teachers make a point of keeping any religious beliefs out of
 
the lessons, so that anyone can take the classes. It is important to
 
keep in mind, though, that almost all of the students ire r
nr
nh r
 
the Senshin Buddhist Church, as are both teachers.
 
The Senshin Gakuin culminates each year with the graduation
 
ceremony held in the auditorium of the temple complex. In previous
 
years they also held a speech contest, but the class has not been large
 
enough recently to continue that tradition. Today the graduation
 
ceremony combines the two.
 
With the exception of a few moments, the ceremony is conducted
 
entirely in Japanese. The program is divided into two parts. During the
 
first half the students sit in rows with the audience, while the
 
president of the church, head instructor, Gakuin advisor, and principal
 
sit on the stage. An American and Japanese flag hang on the wall behind
 
them. The ceremony opens with the "Star Spangled Banner" (in English).
 
1

Graduation diplomas and perfect-attendance awards are given out at this
 
time. Each student walks up on the stage a1one and receives the award
 
and gift from the members of the cabinet. Advice and memories are
 
exchanged between the graduates and the younger students. Their brief
 
speeches are punctuated by traditional Japanese graduation songs. One
 
song has the tune of "Auld Lang Syne," yet is considered traditionally
 
Japanese. This year an award was also given to Mr. Inouye for his
 
twenty-one years of dedication as a language-school teacher at Senshin.
 
During the second half of the ceremony the students take the stage
 
and recite or read from their reading books one by one. It is
 
interesting to note that a student's performance follows the award of
 
diplomas, which suggests that the student's success is not contingent
 
upon the performance at the ceremony. Instead, because every student
 
performs in Japanese, every student is honored for his or her progress.
 
This year Ms. Ono's class recited a Japanese folktale from memory. Each
 
student recited one part of the tale, holding their drawing which
 
depicted that particular aspect of the story. The upper-level students
 
read various dialogues —a story, a proverbial tale, a
i4 an accounting
 
of the geographical features of the earth.
 
Photographs were taken after the ceremony, and a feast was laid out
 
for everyone to enjoy. With the exception of one traditional Japanese
 
cake, the food was typically American. The ceremony is a positive
 
combination of both American and Japanese traditions, reflecting a
 
degree of comfortableness in the Japanese-American community's
 
sense of identity.

Senshin Gakuin -
 Parents
 
On the whole the parents send their children to the language
 
school because they feel it is important for them to have a sense of
 
their cultural identity. They feel that language is one of the most
 
important aspects of culture; understanding the language will help one
 
understand the culture. The parents also feel that, while their
 
children will grow up as Americans, an understanding of the Japanese
 
heritage will help them deal with the fact that they are different from
 
most of the people they will associate with throughout life. For many
 
the Senshin Gakuin is the only opportunity for their children to
 
interact with other Japanese-American children.
 
For some parents it is important that their children be able to
 
communicate in Japanese, should they ever visit Japan. It is
 
understandably difficult for someone who looks Japanese to feel
 
comfortable in Japan without speaking the language. One parent
 
explained the changes in parents' motivations over the years.
 
Initially, Japanese was taught to children becquse parents thought they
 
would be returning to Japan and wanted their children to maintain their
 
proficiency. The next generation taught their children so they could
 
o with the first- and second-generation immigrants. Now the
 
s taught so the children will be able to aid the United
 
1
5
 
States in maintaining good relations with Japan. Another reason
 
expressed by both parents and children is that Japanese can satisfy the
 
student's language requirement in college.
 
In many cases the parents do not speak Japanese. They grew up at a
 
time when most Japanese-Americans were demonstrating their loyalty to
 
the United States; consequently, few Japanese traditions were
 
emphasized in the home. For those who did go to a language school, the
 
classes were very strict. Most parents and teachers agree that the
 
looser format is more effective for today's children.
 
Despite these motivations, Mr. Inouye occasionally feels like he
 
is babysitting. He feels the parents merely drop the children off, come
 
back four hours later, and do not always express an interest in their
 
child's progress. Obviously, this attitude, which can also be found in
 
the public schools, is not the attitude of all parents.
 
Senshin Gakuin -
 Children
 
be doing on Saturday morning. Ms. Ono also expressed her sorrow that
 
the children, "hate to go to Japanese School. Even my kids, they
 
always complaining. That hurting me a lot." (ES82-AS-c8) However, a
 
student overhearing the conversation shook her head in disagreement.
 
1
6
 
The children do not appear to mind going to the language school,
 
however. They may complain about it before they get there, but once
 
there, they seem to have a good time. Most of them are there because
 
their parents want them to learn Japanese. They are not sure why and,
 
when asked, they appear apathetic. "
Since I
'm Japanese, I guess they
 
want me to learn Japanese so, if I go to Japan, I can talk to my
 
relatives .
 .
 .
 ,
 says Yumi Yoshida. (ES82-AS-c1)
 
Harumi Saneto provides a variation on the theme of parental
 
contr 4:
 
Well, I don't know, I don't remember. I remember my mom
 
said, like, when I was little, all I did was talk
 
Japanese. But then, when I went to school, I forgot
 
everything,  'cause everyone else was speaking English.
 
She said if I remembered it, then I wouldn't have to
 
come; but then, I didn't remember it, so I have to come
 
(Es82-As-c3)
 
Because the students attend both the Senshin Gakuin and the Dharma
 
School they know each other well. Some of the older students see each
 
other at public school, but, because they are in different grades, they
 
do not spend much time together. There are a few pairs who are best
 
friends. The junior and senior high schools in the area are culturally
 
integrated, so the Senshin students have friends from a variety
 
cultural backgrounds. In fact, several of them expressed interest in
 
learning Spanish more than Japanese. A few have friends at other
 
Japanese language schools, as well as friends who go to Hebrew school.
 
They rarely share their language school experiences, however, except to
 
teach each other the usu'l four-letter words.

Senshin Gakuin -
 Future of the School
 
Given an opportunity to make any changes i
n the Senshin Gakuin,
 
the first concern is to increase enrollment. There is a feeling that
 
enrollment will increase as parents with young children renew their
 
involvement with Senshin. The church currently has affiliated
 
organizations for all age groups except the twenty-five- to
 
thirty-five-year-olds. Consequently, this age group is less involved
 
with the church when their children are very young. As their children
 
begin school, however, many of the parents rejoin the church, becoming
 
active in the Adult Buddhist Association.
 
Another desired changed, expressed particularly by Mr. Inouye,
 
concerns the lack of conversational ease on the part of the s
tudents.
 
He would like to add a language class that would b
e strictly Japan
 
conversation. Such a class might also be offered for adults.
 
A final concern expressed by the students is to update the books
 
so they are not so "corny" and "boring."  This might make the classes
 
more enjoyable and improve comprehension.
 
In summary, although the Senshin Gakuin has experienced major
 
fluctuations in enrollment, it is still considered an important means
 
by which the Japanese-American community can understand, maintain, and
 
enhance its sense of identity.
 
I
n
 
responsible for making major decisions. They meet once a month with all
 
the teachers to discuss the program for the upcoming two months.
 
Although the teachers are allowed quite a bit of freedom in planning
 
their classes,  these meetings are a means for maintaining a meaningful
 
and cohesive program. No tuition is charged to the students. Instead,
 
the parents are asked to make an annual donation to the Dharma School.
 
The Dharma School occasionally sponsors a fund - raising event within the
 
church. The various affiliated groups also have fund- raisers to support
 
their activities from time to time.
 
The t
eachers for the Dharma School are all members of the church.
 
They teach entirely on a volunteer basis. All of them have attended
 
Dharma School, many at Senshin. There are currently fourteen t
eachers,
 
1
1
 
ranging in age from seventeen to fifty, with betweeKtwo and thirty
 
years of experience. The teachers are not required to have any formal
 
training, yet a knowledge of Buddhism and the desire to explore and
 
share Buddhist philosophy with the children are preferred
 
1

When the Dharma School first began, before World War II, the
 
teachers all held jobs as public school teachers; that was one of the
 
few jobs that Japanese women could have at the time, and most of the
 
Dharma School teachers were women. Traditional arts classes at the
 
church were also taught be women, usually the reverend's wife, who was
 
trained in these arts and was responsible for flower arranging and food
 
preparation for all the services.
 
Classes and Curriculum -
 Senshin Dharma School
 
Previously, all classes, whether religious or artistic, were very
 
structured. Students wer' required to stand and repeat a moral code
 
when the teacher entered the classroom. The classes themselves
 
consisted of formal lectures about the various teachings of Budd'
 
For the most part, the teachings were repeated each year, but wit
 
greater detail and depth as the students got older. Little attention
 
was directed towards other aspects of Japanese life. This format
 
continued until after World War II.
 
Today's Dharma School is quite different. The classes meet for
 
about an hour and a half each Sunday in the classroom building of the
 
temple complex. The students are divided according ço age, with each
 
'3
 
level having a Japanese—Buddhist name. There is also an adult study
 
class that meets at the same time on Sunday and again on Wednesday
 
evenings in members' homes. The classes are informal, with many of them
 
focusing on specific projects.
 
2
0
 
All classes are taught in English. The Buddhist Churches of
 
America (BCA) offers conferences and workshops for a
iiy interested
 
teachers. These are h
eld throughout the year, guiding teachers in the
 
presentation of materials and offering an opportunity to share ideas.
 
There is also an annual conference for the Young Buddhist Association,
 
during which high school and college students can interact with other
 
Japanese-Americans. t
.ne teacher expressed the feeling that these
 
conferences have taken on a predominantly social characteristic over
 
the years. She is sorry that an opportunity to share religious
 
ideas has become mnre of a social event, but agrees that it i
s,
 
perhaps, just as important for students to interact comfortably with
 
other Japanese-Ame?'ican Buddhists.
 
The BCA, headquartered in San Francisco, publishes a wide variety
 
of educational materials for Buddhist organizations. As a member of the
 
BCA, the Senshin Dharma School is entitled to the materials free of
 
charge. They, in turn, pass them along to the students. The Senshin
 
Buddhist Church also publishes a variety of service books, howev ,
 
is currently working on a history of the altar in their temple.
 
fact, the ch"rch complex includes a large library and information
 
center located in the building that houses the classrooms. The library
 
has several shelves stacked with books about a wide variety of belief
 
systems, "hotographs of all past reverends, a counter covered with
 
several handmade objects, a glass case containing religious objects
 
2
1
 
used in the service, and a counter for flyers and announcements of
 
upcoming community events. The table in the middle of the room is
 
currently piled high with research materials for the altar publication.
 
The curriculum materials from the BCA have been in pamphlet form
 
in the past, focusing almost entirely on Buddhist teachings. Recently,
 
however, the Dharma School received the new Dharma School Teachers'  
Guide from BCA. It is in notebook form and contains 433 pages of
 
guidelines for teaching Buddhism. The subjects include traditional and
 
non—traditional arts, ideas for conducting family histories and
 
exploring oneself, and approaches to the many American and Buddhist
 
holidays.
 
Many significant changes have occurred in the Dharma School over
 
the past fourteen years. In fact, Rev. Mas feels that many of the
 
changes would not have been possible at most other temnles. Perhaps the
 
most drastic change, and the one most difficult to accept, revolves
 
aoi md the best time to teach the Buddhist doctrines to the children.
 
There are two schools of thought on the subject. Some feel the
 
doctrines should be taught from the beginning and to wait until the
 
children are older is a waste of valuable time. Rev. Mas, on the other
 
hand, believes that children will understand the doctrines better if
 
they  '
an apply them to practical experiences. He explained that
 
enlightenment can be quite brutal, because it is achieved though
 
letting go of the ego. One must have a healthy ego in order to put it
 
aside, -
however. For that reason he has introduced several programs to
 
help members, both young and old, develop a stronger sense of identity
 
22
 
to prepare for the process of enlightenment. He feels it is important
 
that Japanese-Americans understand their Japanese and theiv American
 
background. Bicultural identity can be painful, especially for young
 
adults. They need to be exposed to overt cultural traditions, as well
 
as to less obvious traditions--such as relationships within the family
 
unit —which contribute to one's personality. Rev. Mas's goal is to help
 
Japanese-Americans feel comfortable with their bicultural identity.
 
The Dhar
ina School programs reflect the goal of exploring
 
bicultural identity. The students learn batik, research family crests,
 
write haiku, videotape major church events, create self-portraits, and
 
examine Budd ist doctrines. Each student is also a member of an
 
affiliated social group within the church, which offers several
 
opportunities for interaction. The adult study classes provide an
 
opportunity for adults to learn about their heritage and become better
 
able to encourage and explore it with their children. One particular
 
class focuses on the many differences between the Japanese and the
 
Chinese, as found in their literature. The adults seem very attentive
 
and appear to appreciate the cultural distinctions made. Once again
 
Rev. Mas relates things to everyday living. For example, to illustrate
 
the Japanese preference for odd numbers versus the Chinese preference
 
for even numbers, he asked how one might arrange four chrysanthemums.
 
Most of the class agreed they would remove one or add another flower
 
before attempting to arrange them.
 
23
 
The Kinnara Taiko drum group and the Gagaku traditional court
 
music group are also important activities for adults. Participants
 
range in age from seventeen to fifty and include men and women. There
 
is also a Taiko group for younger people. Members often bring their
 
children to the Gagaku group classes to expose them to the trai 4tion
 
and its scrange sounds. As Rev. Mas explains, if his daughter chooses
 
not to hold on to her Japanese identity, that is her choice. "I
 
want her to know what she is throwing away," he adds.
 
Because of the method of training for the Taiko and Gagaku group,
 
it is often difficult for young people to maintain involvement for
 
long. The philosophy of lack of ego involvement is predominant. Members
 
are encouraged to learn all the instruments and all their parts, but
 
little reinforcement, either positive or negative, is provided. The
 
experience is viewed as a kind of microcosm of understanding the
 
philosophy of Buddhism, as well as the realities of everyday life. The
 
interrelationship between cultural traditions and beliefs is
 
characteristic of Senshin, as is the method of teaching.
 
An important aspect of the two musical groups is the element of
 
tradition. The oldest form of orchestral music in the world is being
 
preserved by the Gagaku group;  the newest piece of music in the style
 
dates from 900 A.D. The Taiko group, on the other hand, combine  the
 
experieaces of Japanese-Americans in Los Angeles with the Japanese
 
musical tradition. African, Latino, and Native American rhythms are
 
combined with jazz, rhythm and blues, and traditional forms in each
 
presentation. As Rev. Mas explains:
 
24
 
You preserve it, and then you have something else, so,
 
each time, you add something. The Japanese never throw
 
it away, they always just add to it. That's what we
 
want to do--we want to say that if a new form comes it
 
doesn't replace the old. (ES82-AS-C13)
 
This idea was expressed beautifully in a performance by the San hateens
 
(the group affiliated with the junior high school), which they
 
developed  for their teacher as a bridal-shower present. The dancers
 
wore traditional kimonos and samurai dress, ixecuting many traditional
 
steps  -
they danced to disco played through a cassette tape player,
 
howe  r
.
 
The Senshin congregation seems to have responded enthusiastically
 
to the new programming. As with all change, reactions were mixed
 
initially. Some feel even now that the cultural traditions have taken
 
precedent over the religious teachings. More balance may be necessary.
 
Yet, the ne"d for balance may be more closely related to a need for
 
order. The diverse programming lends an air of disorder. Dharma School
 
no longer has the format of school. One student commented that they do
 
not have regular classes--"It seems more like hobbies." A teacher also
 
expressed frustration that she was not able to fit all of her religious
 
lessons into this year's schedule because of the many cultural
 
nrograms.
 
'
eactions to the new Dnarma School Teachers' Guide are also
 
varied. While most of the teachers feel that the new guide is a welcome
 
change, they also indicated that it probably will not be used much at
 
25
 
Senshin. Rev. Mas said he would probably refer to it occasionally for a
 
good story to include in a sermon, but that it is too structured for
 
the current Dharma School teaching staff and programs. Terry
 
Naka ayase  a teacher who has been at Senshin for thirty years, said
 
that the most productive way to utilize the guide would be to offer
 
workshops to all the teachers to acquaint them with all its
 
possibilities.
 
The guide has not yet been implemented in the classes, so it is
 
difficult to know what the students'  reactions will be. They do seem to
 
be responsive to the increased cultural activities and are now getting
 
involved in conducting oral histories w±th first-generation immigrants.
 
Perhaps the best assessment of the value of the Dharma School
 
comes from one student who explained that her girlfriend invited her to
 
church one day and she has been coming on her own ever since. She is
 
only fourteen, but, because the atmosphere has something special to
 
offer her, s e has made the choice to continue attending.
 
"Conclusions
 
Although unusual in Southern California in 1
982, the Senshin
 
Buddhist Church is not unique in the history of the migrations of
 
people throughout the world. The church has always been a central
 
meeting ground for immigrant groups as they arrived on foreign soil.
 
For many the church was the only tie with their homeland, culture, and
 
M 
language.  It brought people together and gave them a sense of ide-lity
 
and security in a strange environment. Over the years, however, as
 
immigrant groups began to feel more comfortable in American society,
 
the church has become less important as a cultural center. At Senshin
 
the bond between belief and culture is reinforced once again. For many
 
the bond gives strength and stability in a fast-paced,  changing world.

SENSHIN BUDDHIST CHURCH OF LOS ANGELES
 
Los Angeles, California
 
Final Report by Amy E. Skillman
 
History of the Senshin Buddhist Church
 
The Senshin Buddhist Church is located about ten miles west of
 
downtown Los Angeles. It was founded in 1
928 for the express purpose of
 
teaching the Japanese language and conveying the teaching of Shinran
 
Shonin, a disciple of Buddha and the leader of the Jodo-Shinshu Sect of
 
Buddhism. There are two distinct and on-going school programs at
 
Senshin:  the Senshin Gakuin, a Japanese language school, and the
 
Senshin Dharma School, a Japanese Buddhist study school.

Senshin grew quickly, offering as it did the convenience of proximity.
 
A critical need for additional facilities arose with the increased
 
enrollment of students which resulted. The dedication of a new
 
classroom building took place in March 1
938. The Gakuin (language
 
school) was formally incorporated as a non-profit corporation in the
 
State of California the same year. The establishing families were able

On September 21, 1

plan to construct a $250,000 religious-education complex and a new
 
minister's residence. Construction began on March 10, 1

architectural plans submitted by Shimosono-Tawa. On May 1

thirty-eight years after the foundfng of the Gakuin, Senshin's

facilities were capable of meeting the needs of 500 Dharma School
 
students and 150 Gakuin students, and of housing the many activities of
 
their affiliated organizations.  All construction costs over the years' _,

A twenty-year, $250,000 trust fund (

the congregation. The principle is to remain untouched; the earnings

extraordinary programs, establish scholarships, and fund projects for
 
the well-being of the congregation. Due to the trust fund,  the temple
 
currently finds itself in a strong position to meet the needs of its
 
congregation.
 
Church Leadership
 
There are currently two reverends at Senshin: the Reverend Hoshin
 
Fujikado and the Reverend Maseo Kodani (Reverend Mas'  as he is
 
called). The Reverend Mr. Fujikado is Japanese .u
is most directly
 
5
 2
 
involved with the Japanese-speaking members (issei) of the church. He
 
is also principal of the Gakuin. Reverend Mas is Japanese-American and
 
works more closely with the English-speaking members of the church. He
 
is advisor to the Dharma School. The combination of Japanese and
 
Japanese-American leadership appears to be a positive force at Senshin.
 
4
 
Reverend Mas explained that many Japanese-Americans carry with them a
 
sense of being a "national embarrassment" to Japan. They look Japanese
 
and, in many ways, act Japanese; but they no longer speak the language,
 
nor do they always understand their cultural make-up. This has caused a
 
barrier between the Japanese and Japanese-Americans in many
 
communities. Senshin tries to accomodate the needs of both groups. On
 
Sunday morning the service begins with both reverends present. Just
 
after Reverend Mas's sermon, the Japanese-speaking members leave with the
 
Reverend Mr. Fujikado to continue their service in a small chapel
 
behind the auditorium. The other church members disperse to their
 
various Dharma classes.
 
Reverend Mas's sermon is a very important part of the cultural
 
enlightenment offered at Senshin. He begins talking about some physical
 
aspect of Buddhism (bells, flowers, or batik), explaining not only how
 
it relates to Buddhism, but also how it relates to everyday life. He
 
also relays a story, either from his experiences in Japan or from the
 
storehouse of traditional tales and myths surrounding Buddhism. These
 
sermons are told in a very story-like manner. In fact, "sermon" seems
 
an inappropriate word. Reverend Mas has the ability and desire to transmit
 
to the l
isteners an increased understanding of their own
 
personalities. As a leader he has initiated many of the changes at

The Senshin Gakuin
 
The Senshin Gakuin currently teaches Japanese to approximately
 
twenty-five students, aged five through sixteen.  At its peak
 
enrollment ran as high as 150. Most of the Japanese and
 
Japanese-Americans who lived in the area have moved away in the past
 
ten years, however. They still return to the church for service on
 
Sundays, but prefer to send their children to a language school closer
 
to home. There are at least four other Japanese language schools in the
 
Los Angeles area. That fact indicates that interest in maintaining the
 
language is still high. Yet, the area surrounding Senshin has changed
 
from Japanese to Afro-American.
9causing a decrease in local interest in
 
learning Japanese.  In fact, the school has considered folding twice,
 
due to low enrollment, but the members decided to continue.
 
The Senshin Gakuin does not pay rent or overhead. The church
 
donates the space to the Gakuin. The students pay a monthly fee of $12,
 
which covers the books and the honorarium paid to the teachers. Any
 
unforeseen expenses are covered by the church.
 
Senshin Gakuin -
 School Administration
 
The Gakuin is governed by a cabinet made up of the principal, head
 
instructor, chairperson, assistants, treasurer, and advisor. These
 
positions are filled by members of the board. The board has about
 
ni n et y  members,  thirty to thirty-five o
f whom are very active.
 
major decisions are brought before the board for discussion and
 
Most adult members of the church are members of the board.
 
The Senshin Gakuin is also a member of the American Japanese
 
Language School Association (AJLSA), which is part of the Buddhist
 
Churches of America and is headquartered at the Hompa Hongwanji in
 
downtown Los Angeles.
 
Senshin Gakuin -
 Teachers
 
There are only two teachers, both of whom are from Japan: Sumiko
 
Ono, who teaches first through third grade, and Henry Inouye, who
 
teaches fourth through nineth. Ms. Ono began teaching Japanese in
 
America in 1
975 and has been teaching at Senshin for two years. In 1982
 
she had four s
tudents —three girls and one boy. Three of those students
 
graduated to the upper level, so there is concern that the lower level
 
class will not continue. Mr. Inouye has been teaching the upper level
 
classes at Senshin for twenty-one years. Three students graduated from
 
the class in June 1982, so his classes will remain about the same size.
 
The AJLSA sponsors conferences every three months for teachers in
 
the Southern California area. The purpose is to discuss problems,
 
ideas, and curriculum materials. The teachers determine what should be
 
7
 
included in the curriculum materials and seek printing assistance from
 
the Japanese Education Department. Even s
o, not all the teachers in
 
Southern California follow the same format.
 
There i
s another organizations which offers materials and
 
conferences for Japanese-language teachers called the Kyoto System. The
 
system requires that teachers be trained in education. While the
 
teachers at Senshin are not required to be trained in education, they
 
can choose to go through a training program of their choice. Seminars
 
are offered every year through both organizations.
 
Senshin Gakuin -
 Classes and Curriculum
 
A key difference between AJLSA and the Kyoto System is the
 
emphasis on the various written characters of the Japanese language.
 
The Kyoto System teaches katakana characters, used for translating
 
other languages into Japanese, first. The system then goes on to teach
 
hirakana, common Japanese writing ,  and kanji, the complex Chinese
 
characters used in formal communications.  The AJLSA teaches hirakana
 
first and  katakana next, interspersing a few kanji words from the
 
beginning. One might infer that teaching katakana first emphasizes
 
the use of Japanese as a second language--a major consideration among
 
Japanese-language teachers.
 
8
 
The question of whether Japanese is taught as a f
irst or second
 
language is further reflected in the choice of curriculum materials. In
 
the past the instructors used books that were printed and published in
 
Japan. Now, however,  they use books that are developed in the United
 
States. Although these books are "much easier" than those developed in
 
Japan, Mr. Inouye feels that they are useful because they reflect
 
American ideals and "seem to fit these kids better." The newer books
 
do not have much information about Japanese culture and tradition, a
 
fact that Mr.  Inouye seems to regret. He feels the students are better
 
able to learn the language with these books, however.
 
The books are accompanied by workbooks which have exercises to
 
complement each section of the textbook. Ms. Ono only gives the
 
students one-half hour of homework from the workbook. The Kyoto System
 
requires much more homework and asks the parents to help their
 
children. Ms. Ono feels this is not constructive because the parents
 
end up doing most of the homework and the children do not learn. Even
 
so, both teachers feel the children forget all they have learned during
 
the week.
 
Bo
 
an A,B,C scoring basis. Mr. Inouye also designs a test each year for
 
the high school students who wish to receive their language credit in
 
Japanese. The test is approved by Dr. Kumizuko at the University of
 
Southern California.
 
9
 
While Mr. Inouye closely follows the format of the books, Ms. Ono
 
prefers to combine the books from the United States with a book from
 
Japan. The books from the United States are very basic, teaching how to
 
count,  tell t
ime,  order lunch, and so forth. They can get quite boring.
 
The book from Japan has stories about Japan, folktales, more grammar,
 
and more words. She explained that the book expresses more Japanese
 
feelings. For instance, the Japanese have many ways of describing the
 
beauty of a flower, each one expressing a different feeling. Ms. Ono
 
wants to t
each those feelings to the children.
 
The students at the Senshin Gakuin are divided according to
 
proficiency. A student's grade level in the Gakuin many not always
 
correspond to his or her grade level in the regular school.  I
t i
s rare
 
for a student to fail a Gakuin class.
 
The Gakuin classes meet every Saturday from 8
:30 A.M.  to 1
2:30
 
P
.M. from September through the middle of June. The morning is di., 
in four fifty-minute periods, with a ten-minute recess between ea
 
period. The subjects include conversation, reading, writing, meaning,
 
and composition.
 
Ms. Ono begins each day with conversation or a new subject,
 
because she feels the children are most awake and alert at that hour.
 
During the second period the focus is on reading, meaning, and
 
translation. For the third period they concentrate on writing single
 
characters and, occasionally, composition. Composition is very
 
difficult for the children at this age, so it is kept to a minimum.
 
10
 
Because the children tend to be tired and hungry by the fourth period,
 
Ms. Ono likes to involve them in some cultural traditions,  such as
 
origami, folktales, or painting, which are more enjoyable learning
 
tools and will hold the children's attention. She tries to conduct
 
these periods entirely in Japanese.
 
Mr. Inouye follows a similar pattern. He gives a test on a recent
 
lesson in the second period. The third period is devoted to reading and
 
the fourth t
o writing. In the past he included lessons about Japanese
 
culture, especially folk dance, but Reverend Mas now includes so much of
 
that in the Dharma School that it is not essential to include it in the
 
language school. This reflects the complementary nature of the two
 
programs. Mr. Inouye occasionally tells stories and shows films about
 
life in Japan; his focus, however, is conversation. Both teachers feel
 
that, while reading and writing are valuable, the most important aspect
 
of learning the language is conversation —to speak comfortably with
 
proper pronunciation. They seem to feel that this is more important for
 
students returning to Japan and speaking with the first-generation
 
immigrants. It is also important for continuing and maintaining the
 
language in the United States. Ms. Ono expressed the feeling that,
 
since the students are Japanese, they should speak Japanese. In
 
general, the students read and understand Japanese better than they
 
speak it.
 
The i
ssue of Japanese as a first or second language is Important
 
in terms of the format of the classes as well. Years ago, when the
 
nisei were learning Japanese in order to communicate with their
 
I
I
 
family,  the classes focused on grammar and were conducted entirely in
 
Japanese. Mr.  Inouye said he would get mad at the students for using
 
English in the classroom. One former student could remember the smack
 
of the ruler across  the knuckles for such an offense. Today, however,
 
the third- and fourth - generation students require a different method of
 
teaching. As Ms.  Ono explained,  it is important that the teachers speak
 
English in order to be able to explain things to the students.  "I
 
strongly believe you have to communicate with the children first," she
 
says.  "Then you teach Japanese to them." (ES82-AS-C8) She also feels it
 
is essential to build a positive relationship with the students in
 
order to spark their interest. The use of both languages seems to create
 
a more relaxed atmosphere in the classroom than was evident in the
 
The classrooms are very much like public school c
lassrooms, with
 
•r
ows of desks, chairs, large blackboards on two walls, a bulletin board
 
on the back wall, and cabinets of bookshelves under the windows on the
 
fourth wall. Textbooks and students' records are kept in a small room

the teacher and students. In fact, one of the students i
s Ms. Ono's
 
child. The younger students seem sincerely interested in what they are
 
learning. There is no pressure placed on the students to participate,
 
yet they are all attentive.
 
Mr. Inouye's class i
s a bit different. The students practice
 
among themselves while Mr. Inouye moves from one level to the other,
 
working individually with the students in each level. All the
 
listen occasionally while each one recites from his or her readi
 
book. The students seem to enjoy working together. Mr. Inouye is
 
extremely helpful to the students, even while they are taking tests. He
 
seems genuinely concerned about their success. The students call him
 
sensed, which means teacher or wise one. Each class begins and ends
 
with a traditional bow of respect.
 
Both teachers make a point of keeping any religious beliefs out of
 
the lessons, so that anyone can take the classes. It is important to
 
keep in mind, though, that almost all of the students are members of
 
the Senshin Buddhist Church, as are both teachers.
 
The Senshin Gakuin culminates each year with the graduation
 
ceremony held in the auditorium of the temple complex. In previous
 
years they also held a speech contest, but the class has not been large
 
enough recently to continue that tradition. Today the graduation
 
ceremony combines the two.
 
1
3
 
With the exception of a few moments, the ceremony is conducted
 
entirely in Japanese. The program is divided into two parts. During the
 
first half the students sit in rows with the audience, while the
 
president of the church, head instructor, Gakuin advisor, and principal
 
sit on the stage. An American and Japanese flag hang on the wall behind
 
them. The ceremony opens with the "Star Spangled Banner" (in English).
 
Graduation diplomas and perfect-attendance awards are given out at this
 
t
ime. Each student walks up on the stage alone and receives the award
 
and gift from the members of the cabinet. Next, advice and memories are
 
exchanged between the graduates and the younger students. Their brief
 
speeches are punctuated by traditional Japanese graduation songs. One
 
song has the tune of "Auld Lang Syne," yet is considered traditionally
 
Japanese. This year an award was also given to Mr. Inouye for his
 
twenty-one years of dedication as a language teacher at Senshin.
 
During the second half of the ceremony the students take the s
tage
 
and recite or read from their reading books one by one. It is
 
interesting to note that a student's performance follows the award
 
diplomas, which suggests that the student's success is not contingent
 
upon the performance at the ceremony. Instead, because every student
 
performs in Japanese, every student is honored for his or her progress.
 
This year Ms. Ono's class recited a Japanese folktale from memory. Each
 
student recited one part of the tale, holding their drawing which
 
depicted that particular aspect of the story. The upper-level students
 
read various dialogues such as a story, a proverbial tale, or an
 
accounting of the geographical features of the earth.

Photographs were taken after the ceremony, and a feast was laid out
 
for everyone to enjoy. With the exception of one traditional Japanese
 
cake, the food was typically American. The ceremony is a positive
 
combination of both American and Japanese traditions, reflecting a
 
degree of comfortableness in the Japanese-American community's
 
sense of identity.
 
Senshin Gakuin -
 Parents
 
On the whole the parents send their children to the language
 
school because they feel it is important for them to have a sense of
 
their cultural identity. They feel that language is one of the most
 
important aspects of culture; understanding the language will help one
 
understand the culture. The parents also feel that, while their
 
children will grow up as Americans, an understanding of the Japanese
 
heritage will help them deal with the fact that they are different from
 
most of the people they will associate with throughout life. For many
 
the Senshin Gakuin is the only opportunity for their children to
 
interact with other Japanese-American children.
 
or  6ome  parents it  is important that their children be able to
 
communicate in Japanese, should they ever visit Japan. It is
 
understandably difficult for someone who looks Japanese to feel
 
comfortable in Japan without speaking the language. One parent
 
explained the changes in parents' motivations over the years.
 
Initially, Japanese was taught to ahildren because parents thought they
 
1
5
 
would be returning to Japan and wanted their children t
o maintain their
 
proficiency. The next generation taught their children so they could
 
communicate with the first- and second-generation immigrants. Now the
 
language i
s taught so the children will be able to aid the United
 
States in maintaining good relations with Japan. Another reason
 
expressed by both parents and children is that Japanese can satisfy the
 
student's language requirement in college.
 
In many cases the parents do not speak Japanese. They grew up at a
 
t
ime when most Japanese-Americans were demonstrating their loyalty t
o
 
the United States;  consequently, few Japanese traditions were
 
emphasized in the home. For those who did go to a language school, the
 
classes were very strict. Most parents and teachers agree that the
 
looser format is more effective for today's children.
 
Despite these motivations, Mr. Inouye occasionally feels like he
 
is babysitting. He feels the parents merely drop the children off, come
 
back four hours later, and do not always express an interest in their
 
child's progress. Obviously, this attitude, which can also be found in
 
the public schools, is not the attitude of all parents.
 
1
6
 
Senshin Gakuin -
 Children
 
Mr.  Inouye feels there are many things the children would rather
 
be doing on Saturday morning. Ms. Ono also expressed her sorrow that
 
the children, "hate to go to Japanese School. Even my kids, they
 
always complaining. That hurting me a lot." (ES82-AS-C8) However, a
 
student overhearing the conversation shook her head in disagreement.
 
The children do not appear to mind going to the language school,
 
however. They may complain about it before they get there, but once
 
there, they seem to have a good time. Most of them are there because
 
their parents want them to learn Japanese. They are not sure why and,
 
when asked, they appear apathetic. "Since I
'm Japanese, I guess they
 
want me to learn Japanese so, if I go to Japan, I can talk to my
 
relatives .
 .
 .
 ,
"
 says Yumi Yoshida. (ES82-AS-C1)
 
Harumi Saneto provides a variation on the theme of parental
 
motivation:
 
Well, I don't know, I don't remember. I remember my mom
 
said, like, when I was little, all I did was talk
 
Japanese. But then, when I went to school, I forgot
 
everything,  'cause everyone else was speaking English.
 
She said if I remembered it, then I wouldn't have to
 
come; but then, I didn't remember it, so I have to come
 
(E582-AS-C3)
 
Because the students attend both the Senshin Gakuin and the Dharma
 
School they know each other well. Some of the older students see each
 
other at public school, but, because they are in different grades, they
 
do not spend much time together. There are a few pairs who are best
 
friends. The junior and senior high schools in the area are culturally
 
integrated, so the Senshin students have friends from a variety of
 
cultural backgrounds.  In fact, several of them expressed interest in
 
learning Spanish more than Japanese. A few have friends at other
 
Japanese language schools, as well as friends who go to Hebrew school.
 
They rarely share their language school experiences, however, except to
 
teach each other the usual four-letter words.
 
Senshin Gakuin -
 Future of the School
 
Given an opportunity to make any changes in the Senshin Gakuin,
 
the first concern is to increase enrollment. There is a feeling that
 
enrollment will increase as parents with young children renew their
 
involvement with Senshin. The church currently has affiliated
 
organizations for all age groups except the twenty-five- to
 
thirty-five-year-olds. Consequently, this age group is less involved
 
with the church when their children are very young. As their children
 
begin school, however, many of the parents rejoin the church, becoming
 
active in the Adult Buddhist Association.
 
Another desired changed, expressed particularly by Mr. Inouye,
 
concerns the lack of conversational ease on the part of the students.
 
He would like to add a language class that would be strictly Japanese
 
conversation. Such a class might also be offered for adults.
 
1
8
 
A final concern expressed by the students is to update the books
 
so they are not so "corny" and "boring."  This might make the classes
 
more enjoyable and improve comprehension.
 
In summary, although the Senshin Gakuin has experienced major
 
fluctuations in enrollment, it is still considered an important means
 
by which the Japanese-American community can understand, maintain, and
 
enhance i
ts sense of identity.
 
Senshin Dharma School -
 School Administration
 
Like the Senshin Gakuin, the Senshin Dharma School has a cabinet
 
responsible for making major decisions. They meet once a month with all
 
the teachers to discuss the program for the upcoming two months.
 
Although the teachers are allowed quite a bit of freedom in planning
 
their classes, these meetings are a means for maintaining a meaningful
 
and cohesive program. No tuition is charged to the students. Instead,
 
the parents are asked to make an annual donation to the Dharma School.
 
The Dharma School occasionally sponsors a fund-raising event within the
 
church. The various affiliated groups also have fund-raisers to support
 
:
heir activities from time to time.

Senshin Dharma School -
 Teachers
 
The teachers for the Dharma School are all members of the church.
 
They teach entirely on a volunteer basis. All of them have attended
 
Dharma School, many at Senshin. There are currently fourteen teachers,
 
ranging in age from seventeen to fifty, with betweem two and thirty
 
years of experience. The teachers are not required to have any formal
 
training, yet a knowledge of Buddhism and the desire to explore and
 
share Buddhist philosophy with the children are preferred
 
qualifications.
 
When the Dharma School first began, before World War II, the
 
teachers all held jobs as public school teachers; that was one of the
 
few jobs that Japanese women could have at the time, and most of the
 
Dharma School teachers were women. Traditional arts classes at the
 
church were also taught be women, usually the reverend's wife, who was
 
trained in these arts and was responsible for flower arranging and food
 
preparation for all the services.
 
Senshin Dharma School -
 Classes and Curriculum
 
Previously, all classes, whether religious or artistic, were very
 
structured. Students were required to stand and repeat 
.a moral code
 
when the teacher entered the classroom. The classes themselves
 
consisted of formal lectures about the various teachings of Buddhis m-
For the most part,  the teachings were repeated each year, but with
 
20
 
greater detail and depth as the students got older. Little attention
 
was directed towards other aspects of Japanese life. This format
 
continued until after World War II.
 
Today's Dharma School is quite different. The classes meet for
 
about an hour and a half each Sunday in the classroom building of the
 
temple complex. The students are divided according to age, with each
 
level having a Japanese-Buddhist name such as Sanghateen. There is also
 
an adult study class that meets at the same time on Sunday and again on
 
Wednesday evenings in members' homes. The classes are informal, with
 
many of them focusing on specific projects.
 
All classes are taught in English. The Buddhist Churches of
 
America (
BCA) offers conferences and workshops for any interested
 
teachers. These are held throughout the year, guiding teachers in the
 
presentation of materials and offering an opportunity to share ideas.
 
There is also an annual conference for the Young Buddhist Association,
 
during which high school and college students can interact with other
 
Japanese-Americans. One teacher expressed the feeling that these
 
conferences have taken on a predominantly social characteristic over
 
the yeirs. She i
s sorry that an opportunity to share religious
 
i
deas has b
ecame more o
t a s
ocial event, but agrees that it is,
 
perhaps, just as important for students to interact comfortably with
 
other Japanese-American Buddhists.

i
"he curriculum materials from the BCA have been in pamphlet form
 
i
:  h
e :ast, focusing almost entirely on Buddhist teachings. Recently,
 
the Dharma School received the new Dharma School Teachers'  
;
uide from BCA. It is in notebook form and contains 433 pages of
 
guidelines for teaching Buddhism. The subjects include traditional and
 
i
on—traditional arts, ideas for conducting family histories and
 
exploring oneself, and approaches to the many American and Buddhist
 
i
olidays.
 
Many significant changes have occurred in the Dharma School over
 
the past fourteen years. In fact, Reverend Mas feels that many of the
 
c
hanges would not have been poss ible at most o
ther temples. Perhaps t
he
 
22
 
most drastic change, and the one most difficult to accept, concerns the
 
best time to teach the Buddhist doctrines to the children. There are
 
two schools of thought on the subject. Some feel the doctrines should
 
be taught from the beginning and that to wait until the children are
 
older is a waste of valuable time. Reverend Mas, on the other hand,
 
believes that children will understand the doctrines better if they can
 
apply them to practical experiences. He explained that enlightenment
 
can be quite brutal, because it is achieved through letting go of the
 
ego. One must have a healthy ego in order to put it aside, however. For
 
that reason, he has introduced several programs to help members, both
 
young and old, develop a stronger sense of identity to prepare for the
 
process of enlightenment. He feels it is important that
 
Japanese-Americans understand their Japanese and their American
 
background. Bicultural identity can be painful, especially for young
 
adults. They need to be exposed to overt cultural traditions, as well
 
as to less obvious traditions —such as relationships within the family
 
unit —which contribute to one's personality. Reverend Mas's goal is to
 
help Japanese-Americans feel comfortable with their bicultural
 
identity.
 
The Dharma School programs reflect the goal of exploring
 
bicultural identity. The students learn batik, research family crests,
 
write haiku, videotape major church events, create self-portraits, and
 
examine Buddhist doctrines. Each student is also a member of an
 
affiliated social group within the church, which offers several
 
opportunities for interaction. The adult study classes provide an
 
opportunity for adults to learn about their heritage and become better
 
23
 
able to encourage and explore it with their children. One particular
 
class focuses on the many differences between the Japanese and the
 
Chinese, as found in their literature. The adults seem very attentive
 
and appear to appreciate the cultural distinctions made. Once again
 
Reverend Mas relates things to everyday living. For example, to illustrate
 
the Japanese preference for odd numbers versus the Chinese preference
 
for even numbers, he asked how one might arrange four chrysanthemums.
 
Most of the class agreed they would remove one or add another flower
 
before attempting to arrange them.
 
The Kinnara Taiko drum group and the Gagaku traditional court
 
music group are also important activities for adults. Participants
 
range in age from seventeen to fifty and include men and women. There
 
is also a Taiko group for younger people. Members often bring their
 
children to the Gagaku group classes to expose them to the tradition
 
and its strange sounds. As Reverend Mas explains, if his daughter chooses
 
not to hold on to her Japanese identity, that is her choice. "I
 
want her to know what she i
s throwing away," he adds.
 
Because of the method of training for the Taiko and Gagaku group,
 
it is often difficult for young people to maintain involvement for
 
long. The philosophy of lack of ego involvement is predominant. Members
 
are encouraged to learn all the instruments and all their parts, but
 
little reinforcement, either positive or negative, is provided. The
 
experience is viewed as a kind of microcosm of understanding the
 
24
 
philosophy of Buddhism, as well as the realities of everyday life. The
 
interrelationship between cultural traditions and beliefs is
 
characteristic of Senshin, as is the method of teaching.
 
An important aspect of the two musical groups is the element of
 
tradition. The oldest form of orchestral music in the world is being
 
preserved by the Gagaku group; the newest piece of music in the style
 
dates from 900 A.D. The Taiko group, on the other hand, combines the
 
experiences of Japanese-Americans in Los Angeles with the Japanese
 
musical tradition. African, Latino, and Native American rhythms are
 
combined with jazz,  rhythm and blues, and traditional forms in each
 
presentation. As Reverend Mas explains:
 
You preserve it, and then you have something else, so,
 
each time, you add something. The Japanese never throw
 
it away, they always just add to it. That's what we
 
want to do —we want to say that if a new form comes it
 
doesn't replace the old. (ES82-AS-C13)
 
This idea was expressed beautifully in a performance by the Sanghateens
 
(the group affiliated with the junior high school), which they
 
developed  for their teacher as a bridal-shower present. The dancers
 
wore traditional kimonos and samurai dress. Executing many traditional
 
steps, they danced to disco played through a cassette tape player
 
The Senshin congregation seems to have responded enthusiastically
 
to the new programming. As with all change, reactions were mixed
 
initially. Some feel even now that the cultural traditions have taken
 
precedent over the religious teachings. More balance may be necessary.
 
Yet, the need for balance may be more closely related to a need for
 
order. The diverse programming lends an air of disorder. Dharma School
 
no longer has the format of school. One student commented that they do
 
not have regular classes —"It seems more like hobbies." A teacher also
 
expressed frustration that she was not able to fit all of her religious
 
lessons into this year's schedule because of the many cultural
 
programs.
 
Reactions to the new Dharma School Teachers' Guide are also
 
varied. While most of the teachers feel that the new guide is a welcome
 
change, they also indicated that it probably will not be used much at
 
Senshin. Reverend Mas said he would probably refer to it occasionally for a
 
good story to include in a sermon, but that it is too structured for
 
the current Dharma School teaching staff and programs. Terry
 
Nakawatase, a teacher who has been at Senshin for thirty years, said
 
that the most productive way to utilize the guide would be to offer
 
workshops to all the teachers to acquaint them with all its
 
possibilities.
 
The guide has not yet been implemented in the classes, so it is
 
difficult to know what the students'  reactions will be. They do seem to
 
be responsive to the increased cultural activities and are now getting
 
involved in gathering oral histories from first—generation immigrants.
 
Perhaps the best assessment of the value of the Dharma School
 
comes from one student who explained that her girlfriend invited her to
 
church one day and she has been coming on her own ever since. She i
s
 
only fourteen, but, because the atmosphere has something special to
 
offer her, she has made the choice to continue attending.
 
Conclusions
 
Although unusual in Southern California in 1
982, the Senshin
 
Buddhist Church is not unique in the history of the migrations of
 
people throughout the world. The church has always been a central
 
meeting ground for immigrant groups as they arrived on foreign soil.
 
For many the church was the only tie with their homeland, culture, and
 
language. It brought people together and gave them a sense of identity
 
and security in a strange environment. Over the years, however, as
 
immigrant groups began to feel more comfortable in American society,
 
the church has become less important as a cultural center. At Senshin
 
the bond between belief and culture is reinforced once again. For many
 
the bond gives strength and stability in a fast-paced, changing world.
