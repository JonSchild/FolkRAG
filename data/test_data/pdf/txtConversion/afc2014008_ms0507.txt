CODE OF ETHICS
 
The following is a Code of Ethics to be followed by NEH
 
grantees whose projects relate to American Indian, Aleut, Eskimo
 
or Native Hawaiian peoples.
 Researchers and scholars should be
 
aware of the  following:
 
(1)
 While the body of law and custom on which the
 
Code is based is rooted in relations with the
 
1
-
1
7ative peoples of North America,  you are urged
 
to follow it whenever living cultures and peoples
 
are involved;  and
 
(
2)
 The Code is based on the Endowment's adherence to,
 
Public Law 95-551,  the Indian Religious Freedom Act;
 
Public Law 95-515,  the National Historic Preserva t
ion
.
 
Act amendments of 1980;  and other relevant public--
 
lags governing relations with Native peoples of
 
";.
6
 
North America,  and is constructed to conform to  ;
 
the principles of these laws.
 
Researchers should familiarize themselves with these laws so
 
that adherence to Federal statutes will accompany compliance with
 
this Code.
 Pleas` sign the following statement,  thereby assuring
 
the Endowment that work funded by this grant will adhere to.�t�he
 
following provisions:
 
(a)
 Every effort should be made in advance of project design
 
and execution to engage the agreem
nent,  advice and cooperation of
 
members of the Native community in planning and execution of the
 
project and  in the disposition
. of results from the project.
 This
 
means that the aims of the investigation,  exhibition,  or project
 
should be communicated to the Native community and the anticipated
 
consequences and results of research or data-gathering should be
 
explained as fully as possible to the individuals and groups likely
 
to be affected.
 
(b)
 where research or exhibition of materials involves the
 
acquisition of material  (objects and documents)  and transfer of
 
information on the assumption of trust between persons,  the rights,
 
expressed interests and sensitivities of those originating the
 
material must be safeguarded.
 
(
c)
 There is an obligation on the part of the scholar/
 
researcher/principal investigator to reflect on the foreseeable
 
reozrcussions of research and publication on the participant
 
por
-ulaticn and  to inform them of prof;able impact.
 
I
 
Code of Ethics,  page two,f
• 
(
d)
 Native community consultants have the right to remain
 
anonymous cr be specifically named and given credit ifA they so choose.
 
This right should be respected where it has been explicitly promised.
 
Where there is no clear understanding to the contrary,  sources should
 
be kept confidential.
 Because funded proposals,  grant reports and
 
other written material in the Endowment's possession are available
 
to the public, no identifications contrary to the wishes of community
 
consultants should appear.
 
(
e)
 Investigators using recording devices such as cameras or
 
tape recorders or the technique of oral interviewing are also subject
 
to the above criteria.
 Subjects under study should understand the
 
capacities of such machines and should be free to accept or reject
 
their use.
 
(
f)
 Individuals or group community consultants should be fairly
 
compensated  (
through reciprocal exchange or monetary payment)  for their
 
services/information and there may be no exploitation of subjects under
 
-
study.
 Scholars should make every attempt to guarantee appropriate
 
credit  (
in the form of co-authorship, co-curatorship or co-investigator-
ship)  and the distribution of financial rewards where appropriate for
 
eroducts resulting from projects.
 
(
g)
 Any report or work considered for publication  (and where
 
--applicable and possible,  films or exhibitions)  should be deposited with
 
the Native representatives of the elders and traditional leaders of the
 
community.
 Every effort should be made to see that such a representational
 
body has an opportunity to view the films or exhibitions which result
 
,
.
-,from work undertaken in the community.
 
(h)
 This Code should not interfere with or preclude any formal
 
agreements made between researchers and Native peoples for the course
 
of research undertaken with Federal funds.
 Further,  the Code does not
 
preclude or supercede ethical codes,  subscribed to and endorsed by
 
various professional associations, but rather,  intends only to make
 
clear the standards expected of those receiving Endowment funds.

FEDERAL COUNCIL ON THE ARTS AND THE HUMANITIES
 
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
 
CONCERNING CERTAIN FEDERAL • .
 
Among
OGRAMS RELATING TO FOLK CULTURE
 
THE AMERICAN FOLKLIFE CENTER OF THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS
 
THE NA'L1
1IONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE ARTS
 
THE NATIONAL
 
.
  THE HUMANITIES
 
THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION
 
The Federal government recoqnizes the need for fostering
 
and supporting American folk culture and encouraging a greater
 
understanding of our traditions and workaday history.
 Recent
 
efforts to answer those needs have built upon earlier Federal
 
initiatives such as the
 
American Ethnology,  the
 
documentary photography
 
Federal Writers Project,  the Bureau of
 
Farm Security Administration's
 
project, and the Library of Congreds'
 
Archive of American Folk Song.
 
Four Federal agencies bear
 
time for addressing the field of
 
evidenced throughout the nation,
 
prime responsibility at this
 
American folklife as it is
 
its territories,  and possessions.
 
2
 
Library of Congress provides programs and services to the field,
 
research and archival services, and public programs and
 
publications.
 The Smithsonian Institution gathers, documents,
 
and maintains collections of the artifacts of American life and
 
presents both museum exhibitions and the major festival of folk
 
culture in our country as well.
 It conducts scholarly research
 
in the subject area of folklife.
 
The efforts of these four agencies have together provided
 
a growing recognition of the significance of America's diverse
 
assemblage of regional cultures and traditions.
 The four
 
agencies recognize that their programs have now evolved to the
 
point where a clearer delineation of agency responsibilities is
 
needed.
 In clarifying their responsibilities,  the agencies
 
intend to make more effective use of limited Federal funds
 
without creating inflexible and artificial divisions.
 
These agencies fall generally into two categories:  they are
 
either funding agencies or programmatic agencies -- either
 
reactive or active.
 The two Endowments are funding agencies.
 
Ordinarily they react to requests for assistance from the field.
 
They do not create activities except insofar as their particular
 
funding patterns have the propensity to encourage certain
 
developments in the field.
 
The Smithsonian Institution and the American Folklife
 
Center are programmatic agencies, acting administratively to
 
produce exhibitions,  festivals and performances,  gather objects
 
and data, and provide direct services to the field.
 As the
 
agencies fall logically into pairs, this document will compare
 
them as such.
 
3
 
With this in mind,  the Smithsonian Institution, American
 
Folklife Center, National Endowment for the Arts,  and National
 
Endowment for the Humanities agree to the following general
 
responsibilities for each agency.
 
II.
 THE FUNDING AGENCIES
 
The National Endowment for the Arts supports activities
 
which make the arts widely available,  strengthen cultural
 
organizations,  preserve our cultural heritage,  and help develop
 
the nation's finest creative talent.
 Support for the nation's
 
folk and traditional arts is considered central to the overall
 
goals of the Arts Endowment.
 Although assistance for the
 
majority of folk arts projects is given through the Folk Arts
 
Program, other Arts Endowment pros-rams may support orojects
 
concerned with the traditional arts.
 
The National Endowment for the Humanities supports
 
projects of
 
humanities.
 
philosophy,
 
research, education, and public activity in the
 
The humanities include such fields as history`,
 
languages,  literature,  linguistics, archaeology,
 
jurisprudence, history and criticism of the arts,  ethics,
 
comparative religion,  folklore and those aspects of the social
 
sciences employing historical or philosophical approaches.
 
Humanities endeavors may concern themselves with folk and
 
traditional cultures from a variety of perspectives.
 Projects
 
involving folklore and folk culture are supported in each of
 
the six major divisions of the National Endowment for the
 
Humanities: Education,  Fellowships,  Research,  Public,  State
 
and Special Programs.
 
4
 
Special Programs also supports projects involving folklore
 
and traditional cultures which fall outside the guidelines of
 
the other program divisions.
 The division also supports model
 
projects which aid groups which have not traditionally been
 
involved in the humanities.
 
EXHIBITION AND PRESENTATION 
The National Endowment for the Arts provides assistance to
 
all categories of exhibition and presentation.
 Its Folk Arts
 
Program supports a broad variety of projects involving presenta-
tions such as festivals,  touring events, and workshops, and
 
supports exhibits primarily in museums,  libraries,  schools,  and
 
other gathering places preferably in traditional communities
 
relevant to the exhibition.
 Where appropriate,  the Folk Arts
 
Program seeks the support of other discipline programs within
 
the Endowment for folk arts exhibition and presentation.
 
The National Endowment for the Humanities,  Division of
  
Public Programs provides assistance to exhibition and presenta-
tion where the primary focus of the effort is humanistic in
 
scope.
 It supports interpretive projects in museums in which
 
the resources of the humanities are specifically brought to
 
bear;  that is,  in which the social,  historical, and cultural
 
contexts of objects and artifacts are emphasized in the
 
presentation.
 The division supports folklife activities drawing
 
upon the resources of libraries serving the public.
 
EDUCATION AND TRAINING
  
The National Endowment for the Arts, Folk Arts Program
 
supports projects involving the location and presentation of
 
5
 
folk and traditional artists in primary and secondary schools
 
as well as in colleges and universities.
 The program also
 
supports short-term apprenticeships for artists who wish to
 
study with a master preferably from their own tradition.
 
The National Endowment for the Humanities, Education
  
Division supports the development, testing, and dissemination
 
of exemplary demonstration projects which will strengthen
 
humanities education in primary and secondary schools and in
 
colleges and universities.
 The division also supports the
 
design,  testing,  implementation, and evaluation of curricular
 
programs to strengthen teaching of the humanities in individual
 
colleges and universities.
 
The National Endowment for the Humanities, Fellowship
  
Division supports scholars to design and direct folklore and
 
folklife summer seminars at institutions with libraries
 
suitable for advanced study.
 It supports teachers at under-

 CONCLUSION
 
A.
 CONSULTATION
  
The agencies agree that regular consultation is a
 
necessary part of effectively coordinated programs.
 The Working
 
Group on Folklife of the Federal Council on the Arts and the
 
Humanities will continue to be a focal point for discussion
 
regarding changes in programming or funding priorities.
 
B.
 DUPLICATION OF GRANTS

 FUNDING VS.  PROGRA_
',I
P
RATIC AGENCIES  
The agencies do not believe that there is significant
 
overlap between the funding and programmatic agencies.
 The
 
process of consultation and the fact that the National Endowment
 
for the Arts, National Endowment for the Humanities, and
 
Smithsonian Institution sit on the Board of the American Folklife
 
Center, should insure that such overlap,  should it occur, will be
 
recognized and dealt with in an orderly fashion.
