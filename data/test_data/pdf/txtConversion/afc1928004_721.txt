TACK THE CONNAUGHT RANGER. 
Written by Jomixr PATTERSON, 
Ant.—" Judy IVI'Carthy." 
ARRAH, come out of the way, make room for ose 
That never knew any sorrow; 
But snaps his fingers at dull care, 
Crying better times to-morrow. 
I 
can do what I 
like with what's my own, 
And to sorrow I 
am a 
stranger ; 
I 
am gay and light both day and night, 
I'm Jack the Connaught Ranger. 
CHORUS. 
Then hurrah, my boys, for fun and noise, 
I'm the boy that fears no danger ; 
My purse is light, but my heart is right, 
I'm Jack the Connaught Ranger. 
Shure I'm in love with a 
fair colleen, 
And her name is Mary Ryan; 
Together we dance upon the green, 
Oh ! about her, faith I'm dying. 
There's lovers comes about her smart, 
Like asses round a 
manger; 
But there's not one can melt her heart 
Like Jack the Connaught Ranger. 
Then hurrah, etc. 
Good night, my friends, I 
must away, 
I 
must, upon my honor, 
For I've promised to have a 
crip of tea 
Along with Judy O'Connor; 
And if I 
call some other night, 
Don't think that I'm a 
stranger, 
For to please you all ' tis my delight, 
I'm Jack the Connaught Ranger. 
Then lamer* etc.

SONG AND REFRAIN. 
Written and composed by J. W. W HEELER. 
lqusic published by CHARLES 1). 13LA.EE & Co., Boston, Mass. 
Sold at all Music Stores. 
Price 40 cents. 
W HEN you see the green flag waving over the red, 
It s 
because it is Irish, you know ; 
And each gal you will find proudly holding her head, 
Now that surely is Irish, you know. 
On St. Patrick's (lay we parade, 
And work every day at our trade, 
At carrying the hod, or turning the sod, 
And find it has paid. 
We like a 
sly drop now and then, 
The same as all tine Englishmen. 
There's never a 
dude = ong the whole brood 
Who's ever an Irishman been. 
REFRAIN. 
For don't you see, this cunning little dude 
With an eyeglass and graceful attitude, 
Would be but a 
toy for a 
bold Irish boy, 
Who dotes on such tender food. 
The wind of his stick would -make them all sick, 
It's Irish, real Irish you know. 
There's an isle o'er the sea that is dear to us all, 
And it's Irish, quite Irish, you know ; 
And if ever perchance you should give them a 
call, 
You will lind them all Irish, you know. 
They carry their " heart on their sleeve," 
In liberty they firmly believe ; 
They're always " true blue," whatever they do, 
And friends they will never deceive. 
There's nothing too Irish for them, 
They love all true-born gentlemen. 
If there you should go, they'll give you a 
show, 
It's natural to all Irishmen. 
REFRAIN. 
On Ireland's shore there's Emmet, O'Connell and Moore, 
Three grand true men, like their sires in days of yore. 
In senate and song they battled time wrong, 
A 
int dealt it full many a 
blow. 
They'd fearlessly fight for Ireland and right, 
It's Irish, real Irish, you know. 
Now, we don't; claim to set all the fashions or style, 
For that wouldn't be Irish, you know ; 
But when out on parade•don't we all sport a 
tile, 
And that is quite Irish, you know. 
We're up to the slang of the day, 
Such as " Boys, now don't give it away," 
And then in the fall we vote one and all, 
And that is quite Irish, you'll say. 
Yes, we know the slang of the day, 
Such as " Boys, don't you give Inc away." 
We'll take a 
sly glass, or blarney a 
lass, 
And that is quite Irish, you'll say. 
REFRAIN. 
At country's call, into line see the Irish fall, 
And hard blows strike for freedom, and home, and all. 
There's Phil Sheridan, a 
true Irishman, 
A 
braver no country can show, 
And Meagher and Kearney, who ne'er used blarney, 
They're Irish, real Irish, you know.

50 IRISH NEED APPLY. 
(New Yerxion.) 
As sung by COTTON and Manta. 
Ix the papers have you read, 
Have you noticed what they said, 
That no Irish people need apply 
To earn their daily bread 7 
'Twill plainly show to you 
The course yCm should pursue ; 
And in honesty I'll show you 
What you really ought to do. 
CHORUS. 
On this you may rely ; 
You will find put by-and-by 
That the sons of Erin's sunny Isle 
Are welcome to apply. 
Just note the Irish girl, 
As she's skipping to the well 
With blossoms blooming on her cheeks 
Like roses in the dell; 
She is so bright and fair, 
With her jet-black eyes and hair— 
Show me your En(*lish lady, 
Who a 
brighter name can bear! 
CHORUS. 
Never let me hear that cry, 
As I 
heard in days gone by; 
(1) 
NO IRISH NEED APPLY.—Concluded. 
That cruel, cold, unpleasing one— 
No Irish need apply ! 
On the plains of Waterloo, 
Where the bullets like hailstones flew, 
There. 
was the Duke of Wellington, 
Bad tuck to him ! what did he do ? 
He beat poor Bonaparte, 
Though he wore an Irish heart, 
And won his wreath of laurels, 
Though the, Irish won their part. 
CHORUS. 
Faugh-a-ballah ! they did cry, 
We will conquer or we'll die! 
Proud England, mind your Irishmen, 
You'll need them by-and-by. (Repeat.) 
Old Ireland I 
will show 
Is the sweetest spot below, 
Where you can get a 
bite or sup 
Wherever there you go; 
So don't treat them with disdain, 
But show each man the same! 
Let all apply, that be the cry, 
And welcome when they come! 
CHORUS. 
Then rise them as you should— 
For ' tis fit we all do good, 
And never crush an Irishman, 
But rise him as you should ! 
(Repeat!)

TOSS THE TURK. 
Words written and Music adapted by TOM Cslotom.

Copyright, 1877, by E. 
H. 
HARDING. 
OH one evening lately, I 
dressed up nately, 
I 
put on my Sunday clothes, plug hat and all, 
And I 
started proudly, while whistling loudly, 
For Neal Brogan's raffle at Hibernian Hall. 
Goino.
t, 
round a 
corner a 
gang of rowdies— 
Oh ! I 
know they're rowdies, for they never work— 
Says, let us give this old Tad a 
racket, 
We will have a 
picnic, boys, and. toss the Turk. 
C1.1011US. 
Now I'm not a 
fighter, nor yet a 
biter, 
But when duty calls I 
never shirk ; 
So I 
tell you plainly, tho' I 
look ungainly, 
That they had no picnic when they toss'd the Turk. 
Oh! the big ringleader, a 
free lunch raider, 
Says, " O'Brien, you had better paint the 
tile,' 
Put crape around it, get an axe and pound it!" 
And he thought 'twas funny when the gang did smile. 
It was then my dander rose like a 
gander, 
For I 
heard one loafer say he'd flash a 
dirk ; 
So I 
tapp'd him lightly, and surprised him quitely, 
And they had no picnic when they toss'd the Turk. 
Now I'm not a 
fighter, etc. 
Oh! they gather'd round me, and thought to pound me, 
But I 
put my back against a 
big brick wall; 
" 
You can't go behind me," .says I, " now mind me, 
If ye stand forninst me I 
can bate ye all." 
Then the gang did face me, and thought to lace me, 
But I 
show'd them tricks I 
learned at Donegal ; 
Right and left I 
pounded, they were dumbfounded, 
And at last for mes.cy they began to bawl. 
SPOKEN. --Well, they looked surprised, and Redheaded 
Mike says, " Who are you ?" " Well," says I, " my name, 
is Cornelius Thomas Francis Meagher O'Brien, and more-
over—"

For coach and horse stop when I 
cross, 
I'm the ladies' own baby ! 
As on they go, they whisper low, 
" 
Are you there, Moriarity !" 
I'm a 
dandy copper, etc.,

WE'RE ALL GOING TO FIGHT FOR DEAR 
OULD IRELAND. 
Written by W ILLIAM SCANLAN, and sung by SCANLAN and CRONIN 
AiR.—" Marching through Georgia." 
ARRAII, here we are, two Irishmen, as you can plainly see, 
We've lately left ould Ireland and come across the sea; 
But it won't be long till we return with comrades brave and 
bold, 
For we're all going to fight for dear ould Ireland. 
CITORUS• 
Hurrah ! hurrah t 
ould Ireland shall be free, 
Hurrah ! hurrah ! ould Ireland shall be free, 
With muskets bright and hearts so light, 
We'll gayly march away, for we're all going to fight 
For dear ould Ireland. 
And when we do return again with warriors brave and gay, 
Our friends will all join in the ranks as we gayly march away ; 
We'll buy them guns and bayonets, and plenty of powder too, 
For we're all going to fight for dear ould Ireland. 
Hurrah ! hurrah ! etc. 
There was dear Robert Emmett, who's now laid in the clay, 
Likewise Daniel O'Connell, who suffered many a 
day, 
When clutched by British tyranny, 0! then was trampled 
down, 
But died in the cause of liberty. 
I'M IN JAIL, MY LOVE. 
Written, and sung with great success, by the Master Banjoist, JOE HART. 
I 
STOOD alone at the bar. 
And got so boiling tight, 
That a 
copper run me to the station-house, 
And there I 
slept all night. 
1 
was thrown down in a 
cell 
With a 
lot of other jays; 
Next morning I 
heard the judge sing out, 
" 
Ten dollars, or ten days ! " 
I 
was clubbed, and run, and made to dance, 
Thrown in with a 
lot.of tramps. 
CHORUS . 
I've had shakes, my love. I've seen snakes, my love, 
I've had the jim-jams and the horrors, my love; 
I've drank ale, my love, I'm in jail, my love— 
Bail out your sailor boy. 
When I 
awoke next morn, 
My hat was seven sizes too small, 
For my head was terribly swelled, 
I'd have given the world for a 
ball. 
I 
was sick and I 
was sore, 
I 
was bruised and I 
was jammed, 
I 
forgot my name and where I 
lived, 
If I 
didn't, I'll be hanged. 
CHORUS. 
I'm sick abed, my love, I'm nearly dead, my love, 
Oh, I've got a 
terrible head, my love, 
A whiskey sour, my love, I 
could devour, my love, 
Send gin fizzes to your sailor boy. 
I'll retire, my love, to the Maria, my love, 
And up on the Island I'll perspire, my love, 
All alone, my love, fll break stone, my love— 
Still I 
ant your sailor boy.

THE TIPPERARY CHRISTENING. 
WHITEN FOR AND SUNG BY JOHN CONROY. 
It was down in that place Tipperary, 
Where they're so airy and so contrary, 
They cut up the divirs figary 
When they christened my beautiful boy. 
In the corner the piper sat thinking, 
And a 
blinking, and a 
winking, 
A 
noggin of punch be was drinking 
And wishing the parents great joy ! 
When home from the church there came, 
With Father Tom and big Mickey Brannigan, 
Scores of as purty boys and girls 
As ever you'd ask for to see. 
Then in flew the door, and 
Hogan, the tinker, and lathering Lannigan 
Kicked up a 
row and wanted to know 
Why they weren't asked to the spree ? 
Then the baby set up such a 
bawling, 
And such a 
squalling, and caterwauling, 
The nurse on his mother was calling, 
Oh ! it was a 
time of great joy. 
And the piper his chants was droning, 
And a 
groaning, and a 
moaning, 
The mild women set up such a 
croning 
When they christened sweet Danny, the boy. 
The aristocracy came to the party ; 
There was McCarthy, light and hearty, 
With Florence Bidalia Fogarty— 
She says that's the French for her name. 
Dionasius Alfonso Marooney, 
Oh, so looney, and so spooney ! 
With the charming Evangeline Mooney, 
Of society she was the crame. 
Cora Theresa Maud McCann, 
Algernon Ronke and Lulu McCafferty, 
Vteginald Marmaduke, Maurice Megann, 
Clarence Ignatius McGuirk.

THE TIPPERARY CHRISTENING.—Conciuded. 
Cornelius Horatio, Flaherty's son, 
Adelaide Grace and Dr. O'Rafferty, 
Eva McLoughlin, Cora Muldoon, 
And Brigadier General Burke. 
They were dancing the polka mazourka, 
'Twas a 
worker, ne'er a 
shirker, 
And the varsovienna In Turka, 
And polka redowa 
Then they marched, and they went into luncheon, 
Oh, such a 
munchin', and such a 
scrunch& ! 
They were as busy as bees at that luncheon, 
With their coffee, tay, whiskey, and wine. 
They had all sorts of tay—they had Shooshong, 
And they had Xing Yong, and they had Ding Bong, 
With Oolong and _13oalong and Toolong, 
And tay that was made in Japan. 
They had sweetmeats imported from Java, 
And from Havre, and from Guava, 
In the four-masted ship, the Menarra, 
That sailed from beyond Hindoostan. 
Cold ice cream, and cream that was hot; 
Boman punch froze up in snowballs, and sparrowgrass 
Patty de foy gras, whatever that means, 
Made out of goose liver and grease. 
Red-headed ducks, with salmon and peas, 
Bandy-legged frogs and Peruvian ostriches, 
Bottle-nosed pickerel, woodcock and snipe, 
And everything else that would please. 
After dinner, of course, there was speaking, 
There was hand shaking, and leave taking ; 
In the corners old mothers match making, 
And other such innocent sins. 
Then they drank a 
good health to each other, 
And to each mother, and to each brother ; 
At the last toast I 
thought I 
should smother, 
When they hoped that the next would be.

JUDY CONNER'S DANCING SCHOOL. 
Written for and sung by Miss Jost Mortals. 
Ann.--" Limerick Races." 
ONCE on a 
time in Dublin Town, 
There lived a 
dame so frisky, oh I 
Who kept a 
school of great renown, 
And also kept good whiskey, oh! 
She used to teach a 
dancin' class, 
And nightly set them prancin', 
And known all over town at last, 
Was Conner's school for dancin'. 
CHORUS. 
With her " Take yer Partners !" " Tune the fiddle," 
'Deed, I'm not romancing' oh! 
Ivery night 'twas down the middle, 
At Conner's school for dancin', oh ! 
SPOKEN.—Good evening, young ladies, jist in time. 
Take yer 
partners for the Ballyhooligan Hornpipe. 
Now thin, attintion. 
1st position. 
Turn your toes out a 
little more, Miss Sullivan ! 
You stand as if your feet didn't belong to you! Mary Brady, 
stop stickin' pins in Tim Kennedy! 
Sure, he's too foine a 
boy 
to be made a 
pin- cushion of! Now thin, Murphy, you needn't 
be after thryin' to kiss Winnie in the corner there ! 
agin the 
rules of the school. 
Now thin, are ye all ready ? 
Shtrike up 
the music! (Dance.) 
Where Judy Conner learnt to dance 
It always was a 
mystery ; 
She used to say she learnt in France, 
But never told her history. 
(1) 
17 
JUDY CONNER'S DANCING SCHOOL. 
Concluded. 
One day she had a 
sign put up, 
The expense sure she was chancin', 
And on the sign in red and gould, 
Was " Conner's School for Dancin'." 
With her " Take yer Partners !" etc. 
SroxEs.—Now thin, get on the floor here every one of ye. 
Johnny Callaghan, don't let me ever see ye come here again in 
them things. 
They're yer poor old mother's injin rubber over-
shoes! 
If ye can't afford a 
dacint pair of shoes, ye needn't 
come to my academy, for I 
wilt have the reshpecktability of it 
kept up. 
And you, McCarthy, d'ye mind, ye owe me saxpence 
hapenny for last week! 
Remember, those who dance must pay 
the piper. 
Now then, are ye all ready ? 
Play us up a 
bit of a 
reel. 
Who°! (
Dance.) 
Now Judy's Dancin' School was known, 
All over the creation; 
In fact the dances she turned out, 
Were a 
credit to the nation; 
She taught the Dublin folks to dance, 
The smart ones and the fools, sir, 
To pass a 
pleasant night—the place 
Is Conner's Dancin' school, sir ! 
With her " Take yer Partners !" etc. 
SPOKEN.—Whoo! Get up here, ivery . mother's son of ye!

BIDDY THE BALLET GIRL. 
Written by J. BRADLEY, and sung with great success by JACK COMMA 
every evening, at G ILL'S, 15 West Houston street. 
I 
Am a 
gay laboring man, 
And I 
have a 
beautiful daughter, 
Who never did care much for work, 
It's her mother's own wish that she anglater ; 
It seems that she fancied the stage, 
So I 
granted her final request, 
And now she's a 
beautiful dancer, 
And ranks along with the best. 
CHORUS. 
On the stage she is Madame La Shortie, 
But her right name is Biddy McCarty ; 
She brings home at night, and at matinees, 
Large baskets of flowers, and also bouquets. 
Oh, she is my only daughter, 
And I 
am the man that taught her 
To wear spangled clothes, and go round on her toes, 
And there is no such a 
girl as Biddy. 
When salary day does arriw, 
All trouble and toil it does smother, 
For, just the day before that there was a 
kick, 
The girl had been scolded by her mother ; 
She's courting a 
clerk in the bank, 
Who sees her safe home at the door, 
And pays a 
big gang in the gallery, 
To applaud in a 
perfect uproar. 
On the stage, etc. 
Last Saturday night I 
got paid ; 
I 
thought I 
would go to the theatre, 
And take the old woman along; 
In the parquette in front I 
did seat her. 
When Biddy came out for to dance, 
My sou Danny was up in the tier; 
Ile cried, " Go in, sister Biddy," 
When they bounced him right out on his ear. 
On the stage, etc.

Words and Music by H. mitt,tab. 
t

And came to this country when scarcely a 
boy : 
And though I 
am Irish, and lived on the Parish, 
Fin first-cousin-german to Patrick Malloy, 
I 
came in short breeches that often lacked stitches, 
Had nails in me choes fit for horses to wear; 
Me mother'd not know me, but if you would show mei, 
I'd quick know me mother and Dublin of yore. 
CHORUS 
rm Teddy McGlynn from the town of Dublin, 
And that is the name you will find on me door. 
I've worked, and I've waited, me brains I've berated; 
I've been to the schools, and to Lanigan's Ball; 
Me father was uncle to Kathleen Mavourneen; 
So l'in proud of me kindred, me mother, and all. 
But now cm a 
lawyer, and feel like a 
warrior; 
I'll dance you the Lancers or jig, if you call. 
I've kept me sbillelah, and own I'm most crazy 
To see me ould mother and Dublin once mole. 
I'm Teddy McGlynn, dz4, 
And soon 1'11 be goin' the truth to be knowincl 
And judge for meself of mild Ireland's woes; 
If green I

The love in me heart for me country's repose. 
For light is now dawning, and Liberty's morning 
Will shed its warm ray on ould Ireland's shore; 
Then Katy I'll marry, and no longer tarry 
To see me ould mother and Dublin once more, 
Then Mister McGlynn, when at home in Dublin, 
Will welcome you all at his new cabin door. 
I've found many cronies amongst toe Malonys, 
And often drank whiskey wid Phelim O'Toole; 
O'Brien and McNielly and poor Miles O'Reilly, 
Were all of us sprung when we waked Tim McDoul 
In the finest society. famed for sobriety, 
I'm welcomed with pride at each Fenian ball ;

Who lives on Fifth Avenue, a.s good as them all,

MICHAEL MURPHY. 
gang by ED. HARRJGAN, at the Theater Comique. 
TEN years two I 
stepped on board. 
A 
ship to England bound, 
My heart and pockets both were light, 
Though I'd not got a 
pound; 
I 
was but young and greesheen then, 
Without deceit or sham, 
But times and things have altered 
With myself, and 
I 
am— 
CHORUS. 
Mister Michael Murphy, a 
man of great ability, 
Known and respected too by all the gentility, 
Patronized by all the nobs amongst the great nobility, 
For Mister Michael Murphy is a 
well known man. 
I 
got some work to carry bricks, 
At fourteen bob a 
week, 
But soon I 
got the sack because 
They said I'd too much cheek; 
So I 
fell back upon the club, 
And when I 
let them see 
That I 
was full of book laming, 
They made a 
secretary—of 
Mister Michael Murphy, etc. 
From that they made me President 
Of our new Home Rule League, 
And I 
soon got acquainted with 
An M. P., Mister Teague; 
My speechifying was so good, 
I 
soon got into fame, 
And everybody tells me that 
The man to make a 
name—is 
Mister Michael Murphy, etc. 
My letters now are all addressed 
Michael Murphy, esquire, 
And if I 
get in Parliament 
I'll set the house on fire ; 
With my great and burning eloquence, 
I'll teach them the right way 
To satisfy the Home Rule League, 
Then every one will say— 
Mister Michael Murphy, etc.

ST. 
PATRICK'S MORN. 
Written and sung with great success by IIENny CARNWY, at TONY 
PASTOR'S Theatre. New York. 
THERE'S a 
day that comes but once a 
year--the 17th of 
March, 
And upon it every Irishman is drinking ; 
All the girls are dressed so gay, and the pipers—how they 
play ! 
And the boys at all the pretty girls are winking, 
Then we all put on the green, and we just feel all serene, 
While the shamrock is our button holes adorning ; 
And every mother's son makes his mind up for some fun 
On St. Patrick's day in the morning. 
CHORUS . 
Then shOut Hurrah for Erin, the land that gave me birth, 
And the darling little shamrock don't be scorning ; 
Such a 
sight ye've never seen as the wearing of the green 
On St. Patrick's day in the morning. 
Upon St. Patrick's eve, when our daily work we leave, 
Every Irishman is frolicsome and frisky ; 
He's a 
coin or two to spend, and another for to lend, 
And at home he's got a 
stinging taste of whiskey. 
At night he goes to bed feeling quare about the head, 
And he snores until the day is gently dawning • 
Then he wakes and rubs his eyes, and then " Bedad," he 
cries, 
"It's St. Patrick's day in the morning." 
Then shout Hurrah, etc. 
And when parade begins, oCh, it's murther for our shins, 
Such hustling and bustling and squeezing ; 
Then of drink there's such a 
lot, and it's always thunder-
ing hot, 
So there's little chance of anybody freezing. 
Then the band and pipes are blowiu' to the chune of 
" 
Garry Owen," 
For to have another chune we would be scorning. 
It's the finest bit of spree that ever you did see 
On St. Patrick's day in the morning. 
Then shout Hurrah, eta.

WHEN McGIIINESS GETS A JOB. 
Sang by O'NEIL and CoNaor. 
LAST winter was a 
hard one, Mrs. Reily, did you say ? 
Well, ' tis myself that knows it, for it's many's the day 
Your husband wasn't the only man sat behind the wall; 
There's my old man MeGuiness didn't get no job at all; 
The Politicians promised him work on the Boulevard 
To handle a 
pick and shovel and, throw dirt on the 
cart. 
Ah, six months ago they promised him work he'd shortly 
get, 
But believe me, my good woman, they are promising him 
yet. 
cnonus. 
Then cheer up, Mrs. Reily, don't give away to the blues, 
You and I 
will cut a 
shine, new bonnets and new shoes ; 
As for me I'm done a 
crying, no more will I 
sigh or sob, 
I'll wait till times gets better when McGainess gets a 
job. 
The Italians, the devil take them, why didn't they stay 
at home, 
Sure we had plenty of our own class to ate up all our 
own; 
They come out like bees in summer-time and sworn for 
to stay ;

WHEN McGUINESS GETS A JOB.—Concluded. 
The contractors they have hundreds for forty cents a 
day, 
They work upon the railroad, they shovel snow 
slush, 
But there's one thing in their 
favor, Italians they 
never do get lush ; 
No, they always bring their money home, taste no gin or 
wine, 
And that one thing I'd like to say of your old man and. 
mine. 
and 
Then cheer up, Mrs. Reilly, etc. 
Ah 1 
the spring-time now is coming we'll all have plenty 
work, 
McGuiness will go back to his trade, shure he's a 
hand-
some clerk. 
You should see him climb the ladder as nimble as a 
fox, 
Faith he's the boy can handle the ould three-cornered 
box. 
The boss is always bawling, Hi! there, don't you stop, 
Keep your eyes upward, don't let no mortar drop ; 
Ah ! the old, man he is always careful, nothing he let's 
I

The divil a

THE LADS WHO LIVE IN IRELAND: 
OR, WHERE THE APPLE PRATIES GROW 
lily name is Ned O'Manney, I 
was born in sweet Killarney; 
I 
can fight, dance or sing, I 
can plough, reap or mow; 
And, if I 
met a 
pretty girl, I 
never practice blarney. 
I've something more alluring, which perhaps you'd like to know: 
I'm none of your Bulgrudderies, nor other shabby families, 
But can unto my pedigree a 
pretty title show: 
Oh I 
I'm of the O's and Mac's, and likewise the sturdy Whacks, 
CHORUS. 
That live and toil in Ireland, where the Apple Praties grow; 
That live and toil in Ireland, where the Apple Praties grow. 
I 
could a 
deal relate, if I 
could but trace my pedigree: 
My Mother was a 
Hogan, but my Father I 
don't know; 
I've ninety-nine relations in a 
place they call Roscarberry, 
And each unto their name has a 
Mac or an 0; 
My Uncle was a 
Brallaghan, my Aunt she was a 
Callaghan: 
And as to my character, why, I 
can plainly show : 
I'm a 
rantin' rovin' blade, and I 
never was afraid; 
For, I 
was born in Ireland, & c. 
May Heaven still protect our hospitable Country. 
Where first I 
drew my living breath, arid heard its cocks to crow; 
Adieu to its green hills and its lovely bay of Bantry ! 
Where many a 
pleasant evening, my love and I 
did go. 
Where shoals of fish, so pleasantly, did sport about so merrily, 
Beneath its glassy surface, their wanton tricks to show. 
Oh I 
those scenes I 
did enjoy, like a 
gay, unthinking boy, 
With the lads who live in Ireland, & c. 
St. Patrick was our Saint, and a 
blessed man in truth, was he; 
Great gifts unto our Country he freely did bestow; 
He banished all the frogs and toads that sheltered in our Country 
And unto other regions it's they were forced to go : 
There is one fact undoubtedly, that cannot contradicted be: 
For, trace the Irish history, and it will plainly show ; 
Search the universe all round, tighter fellows can't be found. 
Than the Ma who live in Irelaxd, 
_ 
BECAUSE WE WERE POOR. 
Sung by GEORGE HUNTER. 
THERE'S a 
dear spot in Ireland I 
long to see; 
It's my own native birth-place, and it's heaven to me. 
Sure my poor widowed mother lies there all alone, 
With my brothers and sisters. 
T'was a 
bright, happy 
home. 
Sure, we hadn't much money, but my own mother dear 
To me gave her blessing, bade me heart be good cheer, 
Then the shadow of poverty darkened my door, 
And I 
left mother and Ireland, because we were poor. 
CHORUS. 
011, my thoughts oft go back to that dear little spot— 
To my brothers and sisters, and that thatched cot— 
To my poor widowed mother—I'll ne'r see he more. 
'Twas a 
shame ! but I 
left her because we were poor. 
I 
will never forget on that bright, rosy morn 
When old Ireland I 
left how my poor heart did mourn, 
When my blessed old mother said, " Be of good cheer! 
Good-bye, Michael darling ! " Farewell, mother, dear ! 
Then my brothers and sisters took me by the hand 
And bade me do right when I 
left Ireland; 
Then I 
bade them good-bye at our cottage door, 
And left Ireland and mother because we were poor. 
Oh, my thoughts, etc. 
Since leaving old Ireland my poor mother's dead. 
" 
God bless and protect him !" were the last words she 
said, 
And the ring that my father gave she sent to me. 
'Tis a 
far dearer prize than bright gems could e'er be. 
And my bothers and sisters, I 
wish they were here, 
For I'm longing to see them; but they'll come, never

HARDING. 
THE regiment is forming now, 
The ranks are nearly tilled ; 
For valor and for victory 
Our hearts are always drilled ; 
All Irishmen unite with us, 
And give their heart's consent 
To live or die like soldiers 
In the Irish Regiment. 
In dashing uniforms :N
.e go, 
So straight in every line— 
Admiring friends their praise bestow, 
And say we look so fine. 
CHORUS. 
Hurrah for the Irish Regiment that waits the bugle's call ! 
Gallant soldiers all, who for their flag would fall ; 
Of raging war or cannon's roar we have no fear a: all : 
We'll march away to glory in the Irish Regiment. 
We'll show our Yankee nation 
What the Irishmen can do I 
In the armory or battle- field 
To duty we are true ; 
When marching on the gay parade 
We are the nation's pride, 
While the stars and stripes and Erin's flag 
Are flying side by side ! 
In dashing uniforms we go, 
So straight in every line ; 
Admiring friends their praise bestow, 
And say we look so fine. 
Hurrah for the Irish Regiment, etc. 
The cause we serve is liberty, 
And we're a 
valiant band— 
Some day we'll see the tyrants fall, 
And freedom in our land ; 
But far away we now must stay, 
And be with hope content, 
While marchinc, on to victory 
In the Irish Regiment. 
In dashing uniforms we go, 
So straight in every line ; 
Admiring friends their praise bestow, 
And say we look so fine. 
Hurrah for the Irish Regiment, etc 
THE CUNARD LIN.r.A. 
By JOHNNY PA'IVERSON. 
ON 
the seventeenth of March, which is known as Pats 
rick's Day, 
From out the river Mersey the " Batavia " sailed away. 
We first put in at Queenstown, for passengers and the 
mail, 
Then our ship she slewed around, and for America aid 
sail. 
CHORUS. 
So, hurrah for the captain, and the officers, too; 
Hurrah for the engineers, and likewise the crew ; 
Hurrah for our stewards ; they were always up to time. 
Oh, there's grand accommodation on the Cunard line. 
Our saloon passengers they were few—just a 
little above 
two dozen. 
We had on board Sir William Vernor, Bart., his lady and 
his cousin. 
The passengers they varied from a 
prince down to a 
clown, 
Who said, to keep our spirits up by letting spirits down. 
So, hurrah for, etc. 
On the nineteenth of March near the bridge there sat a 
group 
Listening to the songs and jokes of some one of a 
circus 
troupe, 
When the chief officer, Mr: McKay, he acted very kind; 
He told the sailors rig some canvas to save us from the 
wind. 
So hurrah for, etc. 
Now we all felt nice and warm, for the funnel it was hot, 
And Patterson amused us with his old coffee pot; 
But when he played an Irish jig with their feet they 
would keep time. 
Sure you'd think it was a 
pie-nic on the Cunard line. 
So, hurrah for, etc. 
Now I'll give advice to all my friends who think of leav-
ing borne, 
To travel by the Cunard line whene'er they wish to roam. 
For safety and civility I'm sure they take the shine. 
Oh, there's no boats half so jolly as the Cunard line. 
So, hurrah for, etc.

THE BOULEVARD. 
A 
POPULAR IRISH SONG. 
the Muffle of this song is published by E. H. HARDING, 229 Bow', New 
York. 
Price 10 cents. 
As sung by Jormr R OACH. 
GOOD evening to you, one and all, 
You're looking well I 
see ; 
I 
took a 
trip in a 
great big skip 
Acrooss the raging sea; 
I've been out of work a 
month or more, 
And you know it's very hard ; 
But now I've got a 
job to do 
Beyant on the Boulevard. 
CHORUS. 
Whist I 
ad id- y ! whist I 
ad-i-d-y! 
Times are very hard, 
But now I've got a 
job to do 
Beyant on the Boulevard. 
So here I 
am, an Irishman, 
And to work I'm not afraid ; 
While my son does carry the pick, my boys 
And I 
do handle the spade; 
My Uncle Dan is an Alderman, 
And he holds a 
grip in the ward-; 
'Tis him that gives the tickets out 
To work on the Boulevard. 
Whist I 
ad-i-dy! etc. 
So now farewell. I'm going away, 
I 
can no longer stay ; 
For if I 
sing any more for you 
I'll lose a 
half a 
day; 
I'm going down to the City Hall, 
To try and get a 
card 
To put my father's uncle to work 
Beyant on the Boulevard. 
Whist I 
ad-i-dy! etc. 
KELLY'S BOARDING-HOUSE. 
MY 
name is Darby Mulligan; 
I 
came from Wicklow; 
I 
reside down in Cherry street, 
In the ould Fourth Ward below. 
I 
live with Mrs. Kelly 
And her husband, Crooked Joe, 
And if I 
say a 
word to her, 
Now, this is how she'll go : 
CHORUS. 
Stop your grumbling, Darby, dear; 
Don't make Cornelius cry. 
Don't you say another word; 
To-morrow you'll have pie. 
I 
suppose you'd like to live upon 
Turkey, quail, and grouse ; 
We can't supply no gentleman 
At Kelly's boarding-house, 
Do you mind ? 
When I 
sit down to the table 
The grub it tastes so nice; 
The tea is just as white as milk, 
And the coffee hot as ice; 
The corned-beef and butter 
They are strong enough to talk, 
And be me soul if they had legs 
I'd take me oath they'd walk. 
Stop your grumbling, etc.

• 
IT'S very strange, indeed, to me, 
That go where'er I 
may, 
So many remarks I 
hear 
About me every day. 
'Twas but last night upon the street 
My style the boys did quiz, 
And one says " you can have it, pards, 
If you can guess what it is ! " 
SPOKEN.--AS soon as they saw me, they shouted. 
" 
Here it comes !" and as I 
approached they all began 
to sing,— 
CHORUS. 
What is it, Heavens, what is it ? 
Is it a 
chromo ? 
Does it live, do you know ? 
Did it blow out or did it grow out ? 
For Heaven's sake what is it ? 
'Twas in the park, a 
lively mob 
At me did talk and stare, 
"I wonder if it's loaded, and 
If that's all it's own hair," 
"It lives, it breathes," one chap did say, 
" 
Its pulse is all serene." 
Approaching me, " old krank," says he, 
" 
I'll see that you're kept green ! " 
SPOKEN. — Yes, and when I 
say a 
word back, they shout, 
" 
look out for it, it's teethin' !" and then again comes 
the conundrum— 
What is it, etc. 
They asked how long I 
walked alone, 
And say " when were you canned," 
And hint, I'd look much better if 
Upon my head I'd stand ; 
( 
1 ) 
WHAT IS IT ?—Concluded. 
And as around the square I 
walk, 
With gl wes and cane and pipe, 
I 
hear them whisper ev'ry where. 
" 
I 
wonder if it's ripe ! " 
SPOKEN.—Yes, and they want to know if I'm natural 
or artificial, and how many of me there are in a 
bunch, 
and whether I'm good raw ! 
But above all, they wildly 
ask— 
What is it, etc. 
THE JOLLY IRISH SPORTS. 
Written and Sung by JACK CONROY and JAS. O'N EIL. 
W E'RE a 
couple of high-toned men ; 
That's what the people say, 
We belong to the upper ten, 
And our style is neat and gay ; 
The ladies all at us smile, 
And say we're full of our tricks, 
Their hearts we do beguile 
And we carry our gold-headed sticks. 
CHORUS. 
With our 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, ha, ha, 
Sure we always tra la la la, 
With our tita tit tit tit ta, 
-We never smoke a 
pipe 
But a 
La Tinidad Cigar, 
Chinese Cigars we hate, we belong to the 
Board of Health, 
And we're always able to treat, 
We're the boys that carry the wealth. 
In summer when we are out, 
To Long Branch we resort, 
The swells they point us out 
As the jolly Old Irish Sports. 
Whenever we get in a 
tight, 
We're bound to make them sick, 
We strike out left and right, 
Sure we always could handle the stick 
With our 1, 2, 3, etc.

Farewell to my father !

Who gave fortune and all, not wishing for fame;

" IRELAND, SWEET IRELAND." 
Sung by BEN. MAGINLEY. 
Ant.--" You never Miss the Water 'till the Well runs Dry." 
On, Ireland, dear Ireland, the sweetest spot on earth, 
The land where on the shamrock grows, sweet paradise of my 
birth ; 
You may search this world, go where you will, and you Will 
never find 
Saco a 
spot on earth for fun and mirth, as the land I've left, 
behind. 
CHORUS. 
Ireland, dear Ireland, the sweetest spot on earth, 
Beautiful Isle of the Sea, sweet paradise of my birth ; 
May Heaven smile upon you, it's the prayer for you I 
give, 
And I'll not forget old Ireland, no, the longest day I 
live. 
The day I 
left old Ireland, and my kind old mother dear, 
I 
never can forget it, for it cost me many a 
tear , 
It almost broke her dear old heart, but I 
told her not to grieve, 
And promised never to forget old Ireland while I 
lire, 
CHORUS. 
Ireland, dear Ireland, the sweetest spot on earth, 
Beautiful Isle of the Sea, sweet paradise of my birth ; 
May Heaven smile upon you, it's the prayer for you I 
give, 
And I'll not forget old Ireland, no, the longest day I 
live. 
When on the seas to America, like an Irishman I 
came, 
I 
thought to make some money, and raise myself a 
name; 
But oh, the .disappointment, not a 
dollar left me now 
When back to mother and Ireland I'm going soon, I 
vow. 
CHORD'S. 
Ireland, dear Ireland, the sweetest spot on earth, 
Beautiful Isle of the sea, sweet paradise of my birth ; 
May Heaven smile upon you, it's the prayer for you I

live.

DANNY, 00 AFTER YOUR FATHER, 
Sung with great success by Jam-
Es BRADLEY. 
I'm Mrs. O'Malley, Roger's wife, 
He is very fond of drink ; 
From Monday morning till Saturday night 
Of nothing else he'll think, 
But go down to the corner store, 
Throw dice and play the cards ; 
Instead of bringing his money home, 
He spends it on all the blackguards. 
CHORUS. 
Danny, go after your father, 
He is down in the corner store, 
Playing forty-fives with the Dutchman—. 
Against it he often swore ; 
Tell him come home to his supper, 
I 
know it will save his life ; 
So that's a 
good lad, 
Go after your dad, 
And tell him come home to his wife. 
Sometimes he takes the pledge, my boys, 
And he keeps it for a 
week, 
Until Saturday night comes over his head, 
To the Dutchman's down he'll sneak ; 
He makes believe he is going for coal, 
And through the side door he'll steal, 
He calls out to the bartender, 
Give me a 
big mug of ale! 
Danny, go after, ete. 
Now, dear fr:ends, he's keeping stra;ght, 
And he never leaves the house; 
He sits down by the fire 
And reads his book, just like any mouse ; 
I 
tell you we are happy, 
Around the house there's peace; 
But I 
understand there's an alderman 
Going to put him upon ti. police. 
"..-
ty, go after, ete.

Where the shot and shell were wlistling,

CHORUS 
We march behind the band, 
True sons of Paddy's land, 
The Irish boys for style are excellent; 
The green above the red, 
With martial step we tread. 
In the gallant Sixty-Ninth Regiment. 
They admit we are the ladies' pride, 
When we're out for a 
grand review, 
They shout huzza from near and far, 
At our Irish boys so true; 
With columns solid as a 
wall, 
Bright unicorn's neat and clean, 
We are one and all sons of Erin, 
From the land of the Shamrock green. 
We march, 
Should America calPon her soldier boys, 
To the front we'd boldly go; 
For a 
righteous cause, our Nation's laws, 
Give battle to the foe. 
We'll ne'er forget old Ireland, 
But keep our powder dry, 
"Faugh a

To conquer or to die.

TE.RRENCE O'ROURKE. 
In Dublin famed city one cold frosty night, 
It's meself, Ted O'Rourke, first saw the daylight ;" 
And when I 
was born, I 
heard my old father say, 
"Biddy, bring the sweet cratur some whiskey and tay." 
SPOKEN.—" Biddy," says me father, " bring the baby some 
whiskey in a 
tay-cup, for by the powers he's the swatest child 
in ,di Ireland, by the blessing of St. Patrick ; Wye see the way 
he sups it?" at the same time she was whisking it down her own 
dirty throat. " Musha where's tne whisky ?" says me father. 
" 
Sure I 
gave it to the baby," said Biddy. " Oh ! that's a 
big 
lie," says 1, " father, for divil a 
drop have I 
tasted." 
While the nurse she was singing and squalling, 
Oh! I 
was crying and bawling, 
My father for whiskey was calling, 
At the birth of poor Terrence O'Rourke. 
At thirteen years ould I 
was sent to a 
school, 
To Father Delancy's at Bally Pantie, 
Who says, " Teddy, me boy, if my advice you will follow. 
I'll make you a 
regular out and out scholar." 
SPOKEN—" So he did; for a 
classical academy was that of 
Itfr. O'Toole's; and here's a 
specimen of one of his best schol-
ars ; he did'nt larn us all about Jew Peter, Brien Bourn, O'Neil, 
Father Matthew, and all the rest of the gods and the goddesses. 
One morning he called me over to him, says he, " come over 
till I 
give you some advice before you go to Amerika—in the 
first place, never give anything away that you hav'nt got. 
Secondly, never steal anything you can't carry. 
Thirdly, never 
forget poor ould Ireland, for if you do, you little trollop, you 
never can say I 
was your teacher." 
With that learning I 
had got quite sufficient, 
With the shelalah I 
too was proficient, 
And nothing but cash was dwfieient, 
To be called Mr. Terrence O'Rourke.

TERRENCE O'ROURKE. (CoNcLuDga.) 
Now I 
began to grow up to manhood's estate, 
I 
thought it high time to look after a 
mate; 
So I 
fixed upon Nora, from Ballyporceen, 
The swatest young crature that ever was seen. 
6POIzEN.—" Be Got! you may well say that—and the head 
et her, it was stuck on the middle of her purty little shoulders 
that would put you in mind of a 
bushel of 'wades tied up in a 
very ugly manner; and then she had two eyes stuck in her dar-
ling little forhead, that would put you in mind of two rotten 
cockles stuck in the burnt holes of a 
blanket ! and the nose of 
the cratur, it would put you in mind of a 
mountain of misery 
looking down a 
hungry man's throat— and the mouth I

mouth I 
the mouth I 'twould put you in mind of the big canal 
for trairsporting praties wholesale, be Gut I And there was a 
beautiful assembly came to our wedding, shure there was all I 
didn't know, and a grate many more too— there was the 
O'Rourkes, the O'Tooles, the Kallagans, the Brallagans, the 
Nolans, the Dolans, the Mullocks, and the Muck Muc-Mullocks, 
and no sooner were we seated down to a 
beautiful dinner of 
pig's tripe and praties, than up jumps Teddy Moore, ( trailing 
his dirty ould coat,) says he, " Who dare tread on the coat of 
an O'Moore," " Musha I 
who dare talk of an O'Moore in the 
presence of a 
Muck Mulloch, who's name was known before the 
birth of Moses, and descended in regular succession down from 
King Shane to Muck, for double Muc-Muc, Muck Mulloch."

THE TWO SERVANT GIRLS. 
Written by T. REAGAN, of McCoNNIN and REAGAN, for the Rus. 
SELLS. 
W E'RE W O 
neat servant girls, Mary Flynn and Kate 
Burke, 
Not far from this spot in a 
hotel we work ; 
It's full of play-actors and all such like boys, 
And from morning till night there's the devil's own noise. 
CHORUS. 
With dancing and singing from morning till night, 
And to imitate each one it is our delight; 
Kind friends, pay attention, we've not long to stay, 
And the doings of play-actors we will now give away. 
There's two song and dance men, sure, in Room No. 9, 
With their .feet they keep bolting the floor all the time ; 
Their legs look like pipe-stems, with tight skinny pants, 
So we'll now imitate them white we have the chance. 
With dancing, etc. 
Now we don't want to tarry ; we are willing to marry; 
Young men, won't you have us !—now here's a good 
chance; 
We are young and good-looking, and can do all your 
cooking, 
And all kinds of jigs we will learn you to dance. 
With dancing, ett.

SWATE CASTLE GARDEN. 
When I 
landed at Swate Castle Garden, 
I'd just came from the say, 
In my p ) ckets I 
had not a 
farthing, 
As I 
stepped out up the Broadway; 
I 
walked up to a 
lamp-lighter, 
The mystery for to unravel, 
His hair was cut short, like a 
fighter, 
So I 
shouldered my bundle and travelled. 
CHORUS. 
Hurrah for the stars and the stripes, 
And the land where we never see fogs, 
if I 
hadn't come here, by the pipes. 
I'd been c1.4≥..ging up turf in the bogs 
Shnre the road it was dirty and sloppy, 
Until I 
came to a 
street they call Wall, 
A blackguard shouted, there goes a 
Croppy. 
Whin I 
kiln to the big City Hall, 
I 
axed a 
Dutch barber the way; 
He answered me dunder and blitzen, 
And a 
big old fat Yankee stepped out, 
And. made me an American citizen. 
Hurrah for the Stars, ik 
The first time 
wint out to Chicago, 
The weather it was very warm 
The Commissioners axed me if I'd go 
And settle upon a 
nice farm. 
No, says I, I'll go back to New-York, 
Where the Politicks they are so pretty, 
Lave your Dutchmen stop here and work; 
But be jabers I'll stick to the City. 
Hurrah for the Stars. eze. 
Bad luck to that villain from Sligo, 
Ohure he tould me his name it was Hubba 
Re sonid me a 
card for Chicago; 
Be my soul, 'twas an on d 
Jack of Clubs, 
But I 
musn't indule-e 
in reflections, 
What I've said isn't worthy of note, 
I'll be running for Sheriff next elcction, 
So step up me brave boys, and vote

Two Irish gossoons from sweet county Kerry,

Thorough bred Micks.

We all go dancing around the room.

The left foot first, then lightly tread

And all the Yankee nation, 
Stars and stripes, and shamrock bright arrayed; 
The Irish shout, the girls turn out, 
To see the celebration ; 
We march stiff as starch, 
In the Patrick's day parade. 
You should see the marshal on his horse, 
Like Napoleon Bonyparte, 
And as he rides along the line, 
lied break each lady's heart, 
And if the rain should fall down then, 
We hoist our umbrellas high, 
For history states that Irishmen 
Are always warm and dry; 
Then two by two away we go, 
Up Broadway through rain or snow; 
We'd face the divil, friend or foe, 
In the Patrick's day parade. 
We shout hurrah, eta. 
Then here's success to Patrick's day, 
Though it comes but once a

And though I'm not a

On that day I'd drink my beer ; 
I'll wear the shamrock in my hat; 
The green, my boys, ' twill never fade, 
And march along with Dan an' Pat, 
In the Patrick's day parade;

'OLD IRELAND IS THE COUNTRY i WAS 
BORN IN .-
By 
JOUNNY PATTERSON. 
On, I 
have just left Donegal, and I 
thought I'd give a 
call— 
It is a 
thing that becomes an honest neighbor— 
For I 
am going to cross the say, bound for America, 
Where I 
am tould a 
man is paid for his labor. 
it is there I'll see, Ochone ! the boys I 
knew at home— 
Oh, the boys I 
often drank with until morning ; 
But wherever I 
may go, sure I'll have you all to know 
That old Ireland is the country I 
was born in. 
CHORUS. 
So now strike up your band in praise of Paddy's land, 
Although I 
am going to it in the morning ; 
But wherever I 
may roam, sure I'll always think of home, 
For old Ireland is the country I 
was born in. 
Ah, then, many a 
weary mile I 
have walked in Erin's Isle, 
And many are the hardships I 
have seen sure. 
I 
have seen both young and old starving in the cold, 
When hurled by the landlord from the door ; 
But now those days have past, and I 
hope I've seen the 
last. 
May the wrongs of my country soon be righted, 
Then the world soon would see Ireland proud and free, 
If her sons would only be united. 
So now strike, etc. 
So now I'll say good-bye, for the time is drawing nigh, 
And the steamer she leaves Queenstown to-morrow; 
Croth, my luggage it is light, and my purse not very bright, 
But my heart is well loaded down with sorrow. 
So farewell, poor Granuail; from you I 
now must sail, 
As thousands of my people done before me; 
5ut if I 
could live at home, sure from there I'd never roam.

He never traveled out without he had his old Blackthorn. 
St. Patrick used it likewise, boys, to banish toads and frogs ; 
And it grows in dear old Ireland on the hills and in the bogs. 
If it could speak what tales 'twould tell, of the heads that it 
has broke, 
And how it made the factions fly from its all powerful stroke; 
It never takes advantage of its enemy when down,

That's the reason why I 
love it so, old Ireland's rale Black,

It never runs in debt at all, but pays what may be ow'n,

1VIRS. CASEY'S RAFFLE. 
Written and sung by Bainir ha SNELL. 
Ir you listen to me for awhile 
I'll tell you a 
tale ; 
You all know Mrs. Casey, down 
The street, that sells the ale. 
She gave a 
raffle for a 
stove, 
And to have a 
dance as well; 
And I 
being the floor manager, 
had tickets for to sell. 
SPOKEN —
Mrs. Casey is a 
particular friend of John McSwe-
gan, and a 
full cousin of William Waterhouse ; and lter husband 
Sam O'Casey, alias Gas house Sam—( he was once employed in 
the Gas House at sixty dollars a 
month, wheeling smoke out in 
a 
push- cart)—he went to the war as a 
soldier, and never re-
turned, and Mrs. Casey raffled off the old stove. 
CHORD'S. 
But oh, what a 
row ! I 
yin tell it to you now ! 
Breaking heads, with slats of the beds ; 
McGuilin fainted, I 
thought he was dead, 
O'Brien lost his hat, what do you think of that 7 
Mrs. O'Leary lost her hoops at Casey's r:t-te 
Now, in came John McIntee, 
Along with Rodger Dunbar ; 
When up jumped O'Brien, the tiddler, 
And says, this is going too far. 
But before he had time to open his 'north, 
He was lying on the floor ; 
And I 
like a 
flg.hting man, 
Busted through the door. 
SPOKEN.—Begorra, I never saw such a 
fracas in my born 
days before. Whin they knocked O'Brien down, he bawled out 
for Nixey, and cheese it ; and they came in with billy-jacks, and 
knocked every body down that came in reach of them. 
And 
Nancy McGowan got excited and jumped clear out of a 
pull-
back dress. 
But oh ! what a 
row, etc. 
The raffling then did commence, 
As you may understand; 
McGutlin threw forty-four, 
And O'Donnell called his hand 
But, Mrs. Casey got vexed then, 
And ordered thim all out; 
When the fiddler played Patrick's day, 
Then you had ought to hear them shout.

Hell shouting you never heard in your life ; but 
when the supper was announced, everything became quiet.

splendid supper. 
There was mackerel and ice-

John Bradley went to wait 
on the ladies. 
Re asked one girl what she would have ? 
Says 
she, " I 
will have quail." 
Says John, " You will have bean 
soup, or you will give your seat to Biddy Doyle." 
Another 
young girl wanted an egg dropped on toast ; says John, " You 
will get some old hen to drop it, or you will not get it here to-
night." 
Then Bermidas Conklin wanted to make a speech. 
Says he, " Would I 
were an eagle ; that I 
might fly over the sea 
and spread the liberty of my country !"

THE OULD HATS OF ' 08." 
The Music of this song is published by W M. A.

Price 35 cents. 
Music by A. H OFFMAN 
THESE hats were made in Dublin town 
In the year of ninety-eight, 
And you can see they are still in style, 
For they look both clean and nate; 
These hats are very dear to us, 
Since we left sweet Dublin Bay, 
And the only time you see them out 
Is on Saint Patrick's day. 
We are Irishmen, both heart and hand, 
From far across the say, 
And the only time we wear these hats 
Is on Saint Patrick's day. 
These hats were worn by heroe.3 bold 
That lived in the Etdrald Isle. 
When O'Connell went to parliament, 
They were then just out in style ; 
They too were worn by dukes and earls, 
For they looked so trim and nate ; 
Three cheers, me boys, for the ould hats 
That were worn in ninety-eight. 
We are Irishmen, etc. 
Oh, when Saint Patrick's day comes on— 
It's the seventeenth of March— 
Then we turn out both brave and stout, 
Everything as stiff' as starch ; 
We march along, and sing a 
song, 
Dressed up in green and blue ; 
It reminds us of the good ould days 
When the ould hats were new. 
We are Irishmen, etc. 
THE IRISH WEDDING. 
Written by BILLY NOONAN and sung by ALICE BATEMAN. 
IN 
our home in Ireland, 
Over across the ocean, 
That's the place where we were born; 
Thin we took the notion 
Just to leave ould Ireland, 
And her bogs and mireland. 
America we love so well 
We'll never leave it more. 
CHORUS. 
Soon we will be married, 
Then we'll give a 
party. 
If you come and see us, 
A 
welcome you'll get hearty. 
You'll find fun and glory, 
Music, song, and story. 
We will sing am- dance for you ; 
To please ye's all we'll try. 
We love fun and pleasure. 
What's the fun in sighing ? 
There's no use in looking sad. 
Cowards do be sighing. 
In this land of plenty 
Pockets never empty, 
Don't forget to call and see 
This Irish couple wed, 
Soon we will, etc.

And shyly glanced upon him from the corner of their eye! 
Unto his master, lea], and true he never swerved an inch,

BIG RUBBER BUSTLE. 
Banjo Solo by ED. H ADDIGI.N. 
I'LL iing of my girl. my lovely girl, 
She could play seven up and rounce, 
One fault she had, she had eyes like a 
shad, 
She couldn't set still but she'd bounce. 
I 
shall never forget the first time we met, 
With a 
wash- tub she was having a 
tussle, 
She fell on the ground and bounced out of town, 
The gal with the big rubber bustle. 
I 
searched far and near till I 
found out my dear; 
She was stuck on the end of a 
steeple, 
High in the air she was hung by the hair, 
Making snouts down at the people. 
A 
rope I 
soon found, fetched her to the ground, 
It used up a 
great deal of muscle ; 
To the preacher we sped, I 
was bound to wed, 
The gal Avid the injun rubber bustle. 
When we got to the place she was red in the face, 
The preacher ses now den I'll tie her ; 
On her bustle she dropped, frough de skylight she popped 
Like a 
base ball de boys call a 
flyer. 
She lit on a 
cloud and went out of sight, 
To get into heaven she'll tussle, 
She made a 
mile at a 
jump, at every thump 
She got on dat big rubber bustle.

Stop with your Kathleen dear.

I've got pots and kettles shining bright, 
To deck our cottage out ; 
The boys and girls are waiting, dear,

And the lark will sweeter sing, 
And the bells from every village spire 
The joyful news shall ring.

DUFFY'S OPENING NIGHT. 
Originally sung by JACK CONROY. 
DID you ever hear tell of Pat Duffy ? 
He came from the County Mayo. 
Last week, shure, he started a 
bar-room 
Down in the Fourth Ward below. 
There was lager, free lunch, and whiskey. 
Faith, indeed, ' twits an elegant sight ; 
But the boys, one and all, they got frisky 
On Duffy's grand opening night. 
CHORUS. 
Ah, but Duffy sold horrible liquor 
It would knock you up high as a 
kite, 
And the bar I'm sure never looked sicker 
Than on Duffy's grand opening night. 
Poor Duffy sent out invitations, 
And invited his neighbors to come. 
He told them he'd treat them all dacent, 
And give them their fill of good rum. 
They came there in droves and by dozens, 
And got into a 
terrible fight.' 
They broke all the doors and the windows 
On Duff,y's grand opening night. 
Ali, but Duffy, ete,, 
They stole all the stock that he had there, 
And drank all his whiskey so sweet ; 
They took both his clothes and his money, 
And threw him out into the street. 
They scattered his family, and left him 
To roam in a 
terrible plight. 
Poor Duffy now lives on free lunches 
Since lie gave the grand opening night. 
Ah, but Duffy, etc.
