"California"When formed our band, we are all well nammed mannia To journey afar to the promised
land.The gold ore in rich in storeOn the banks of the Sacramento shore.Chorus: [md] Then Ho, boys
ho!To California go.There's plenty of gold in the world, I'm told,On the banks of the Sacramento
shore.As oft we roam o'er the dark sea's foam,Will not forget kind friends at home,But memory
kind still brings to mindThe love of friends we left behind.Chorus: [md] [We'll?] expect our share
of the coarsest fare,And sometimes sleep in the open air,On the cold damp ground we'll sleep all
round (sound)Except when the wolves go howling round.Chorus: [md] As we explore to the distant
shoresFilling our pockets with the shining ore,How will it sound as the shout goes round,Filling our
pockets with a dozen of pounds.Chorus: [md] The gold is there almost anywhere,We dig it out rich
with an iron bar,But where it is thick, with spade or pickWe take out chunks as big as a brick.Chorus:
[md]
