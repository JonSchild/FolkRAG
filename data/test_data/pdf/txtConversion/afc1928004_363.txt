'Twas down to Aunty Jacksons, 
Dar was a 
big reception, 
Of high toned aristocratic coons, 
Full of sweet affection ; 
Such singing, and such dancing. 
We made de ceiling shake, 
But de cream oi ad de evening, 
Was walking for dat cake. 
CHORUS. 
Gentle on de toe, we darkies step out so 
Easy and so gracefully, around de room we go, 
Do wenches captivate, we all persumbulate, 
High toned colored people.

HART. 
Whin we came out from Cork, 
This day twelve months ago; 
We landed in New York, 
At the Battery here below. 
We wint out on the railroad, 
On the freight that wint so slow; 
An' settled down a-farmin', 
In the State of Ohio, 
CHORUS. 
Oh, it's bothered we are really, 
We never have no rest, 
Since we met with Horace Greeley, 
And the day that we wint West. 
The divil a 
bite we ate 
Till we got to Chicago; 
Nor not a 
wink of slape, 
Oh, how could they trate us so? 
Then we rid upon the stages, 
All ' cross the prairie land; 
And left the State of Ohio, 
For the State of Michigan. 
Oh, it's bothered, etc. 
We're tired out complate, 
Wid work and fat-i-gue; 
It's our frinds that we will seek, 
D'yees know thim, now, any of you ? 
Sure we would like to find thim, 
If yees would interest 
Yerselves just for a 
moment, sure, 
We're strangers from the West. 
Oh, it's bothered, etc.

It goes flip flap like treeses in de wind. 
Come along, sister, don't get left,

And never, never snore. 
Oh, oh, sweet slumbers. 
Sweet ham bone I

It makes me slumber, slumber in my sleep, 
It curls my hair in ringlets, ringlets tight, 
And keeps me from de night horse in de night

Und smoke, und wait, and snuffoeate, 
Und shoo, und shoo dem flies.

B.—I

The last thing I 
turned up was four aces. 
if — You don't mean to say you found cards in my pocket! 
B--17e.-
i, you rascal, dats a 
nice church you go to. I 
tell you 
you better give it up, its bad policy—bad policy. 
I 
can prove 
to you its had. 
I 
can prove to you that life is nothing but a 
game of cards. 
—How so, prove it. 
13.—You know our life is like a 
game of cards, 
That each man tries to learn, 
Each shuffles, cuts and deals the pack, 
And each a 
trump cloth turn. 
Some turn a 
high card to the top, 
While others turn a 
low. 
Some hold a 
hand flushed with trumps, 
While others none can show. 
When Hearts are trumps we play for love, 
And pleasure decks the hour. 
No thought of sorrow checks our joys, 
in pleasant rosy bowers. 
When Diamonds chance to crown the pack, 
Its then men stake their gold. 
Large sums are often lost and won, 
By gamblers young and old. 
• 
17 
When. Clubs are trumps, look out for war, 
On ocean or on land, 
For horrid deeds are often done, 
When Clubs are in the hand. 
The last game of all, 
Is when the Spade is turned by the hand of time, 
it's him that finishes up the game, 
In every land and clime. 
No matter how much a 
man may make, 
Or how much a 
man may save, 
You'll find the Spade turns up at last, 
And digs the gamblers' grave. 
ifid.—Now we will hear from our Senator on the right. 
(Music.) 
There's music in a 
scolding wife, 
That keeps a 
home in awe, 
There's music in a 
musketor, 
Or the filing of a 
saw. 
There's music in a 
thomas cat, 
Preparing for a 
fight. 
There's music in a 
squalling brat 
At any hour of night. 
There's music in a 
dinner horn, 
There's music in a 
kettle. 
There's music in your knife and fork, 
When you eat your vittals. 
There's music in a 
bumble-bee, 
Or a 
bug that flies about. 
There's music in my Mary Ann, 
But its hard to bring it out.

NOT and SHOT,

Shot, and Shot wrote back to Not, and Mr. Not from Mr. Shot 
the deadly challenge got. 
But Mr. Not, replied to Shot that he 
declined it not. 
So big Mr. Not, and big Mr. Shot, their tried 
revolvers got. 
The friend of Not, and the friend of Shot repair-
ekinto an open lot, where Mr. Not, and Mr. Shot, three glorious 
rounds they fought. 
Mr. Not, he got the shot, but Shot he got 
it not. 
For Mr. Not had missed his shot. 
As Mr. Not had 
missed his shot, and Shot had missed his not. 
Not was shot 
and Shot was not. 
And Shot the glory got. 
BRANDY PUNCH. 
Written by E . H ARRIGAN. 
By 
Johnson do you know what to compare woman 
? 
Mid.—What do you compare woman to? 
Bones.-1 
compare woman to a 
ship. 
Mid:—And why do you compare woman to a 
ship ? 
13014t8.—Because she carries pews from home, and brings it 
in from abroad. 
And again I 
compare woman to a 
ship, be-
cause her rigging cost more than her hull. 
But I 
do think that 
woman was originally intended for a 
bowl of brandy- punch. 
.1Iid.—You are very sarcastic on the ladies. 
End.— Oh no, not at all. 
But I'll tell you why I 
compare 
woman to a 
bowl of brandy- punch. 
In order to make a 
bowl 
of brandy- punch, first, you put in the brandy to make it strong, 
and the water to make it weak. - Now there's a 
contradiction to 
begin with. 
Next you put in the lemon to make it sour, and 
the sugar to make it sweet. 
After you have done all that, stir 
it up with the ladle, and your brandy-punch is ready for use. 
Now, ill prove to you that woman is formed of the same con-
tradiction. 
The circular form of the bunch bowl, denotes the 
daily routine of her domestic duty. 
The brandy denotes her 
courage and strength in the trying hour of sickness, misery or 
affliction. 
The water, the natural purity of her heart. 
The 
lemon— 
Xid.—What of the lemon ? 
19 
Bones.—That's her tongue, but we wont say anything about 
that. 
The sugar denotes the natural sweetness of her disposi-
tion, and the ladle— 
sir, what of the ladle ? 
Bones.—The ladle shows what a 
spoon she can make of her 
husband. when she is a 
mind to stir him up. 
GIANT GAG. 
..1/id.—Now we will hear from Eph. 
Bonts.—Sam I 
took my gal down to the Branch the other day. 
Let's see, there was Grant, Sherman. Butler and all the " boys" 
31-id.—Oh nonsense, Grant -would'nt keep your company. 
Bones.—Oh yes he did, he danced with her all day, and 
the day was so warm he actually smoked. 
Then I 
took the 
"boys" out to the bar 
Grant took his straight. 
Sherman took 
his mixed. 
Butler took his crooked. 
Mid.—How is that? 
Bones.—He bent his elbow on an elevation with his eye. Then 
Grant treated. 
Butler bottled up. 
But Sherman he would'nt 
treat. 
NO.—How's that ? 
Bones.—Because he never was known to retreat. 
Then we 
went out to drive. 
Butler said he drived more than any of em. 
Sherman said he had drived a 
million horses. 
e? 
Bones.—From Atlanta to the sea. 
But Grant sea that's all 
right, but I've got the reins and I'm going to hold ' em. 
Then 
Sherman said his grandmother was no gentleman. 
Then But-
ler ses, what for, and I 
ses, don't say it again, and Grant ses, 
you're another, and Sherman ses, you can't do it, Butler ses, he 
would if he could, Grant ses, if you woultint how could you, 
I 
ses, I 
could'nt, Sherman ses, could you, Grant ses I 
could. 
I 
ses I 
would'nt if I 
could, would you, and could not fib, and 
my eye was awful black. 
But we're good friends now, 
Mid.—How's that ? 
Bones.—Grant ses " Let us have peas." 
We had peas for' 
dinner next day. and that settled it.

THE TERRIBLE OBSTINATE MAN. 
END SONG or BANJO SOLO. 
Air—" Gendarmes" 
Original by NED HARRIGAN. 
OLD Gabriel Withers he was fat. 
With the boys he would go ' round, 
He was limber and as spry as a 
cat. 
He weighed four hundred pounds. 
They said he was a 
natural growl, 
For he uttered many a 
damn; 
And his voice was the worst, 
You ought to hear the old man growl, 
His voice was the worst. 
Such a 
terrible obstinate man. 
If you ask him out to take a 
ride. 
In a 
Pullman Palace Car, 
For an old stage coach he'd make a 
dive, 
He could stand a 
terrible jar. 
Then ask him to take whiskey punch. 
Or a 
sandwich with plenty ham; 
He'd eat pig's feet, pig's feet, you know, 
Just for a 
lunch; 
Ffe'd eat pig's feet, 
Such a 
terrible obstinate man. 
• 
If the lay was fair and as clear as a 
bell, 
He would wear his great big boots, 
And always carry an umbrell, 
While the boys at him made snoots. 
But when a 
stormy day there came, 
In his shirt sleeves he would stand; 
And he'd get awful wet, 
While standing out in the rain; 
He'd get awful wet, 
This terrible obstinate man. 
His friends advised him to take a 
wife, 
Some young girl good as gold; 
That would make him happy all his life, 
But he married something old.

And they said he was dead,

COLORED GENTLEMEN. 
Original by ED. HARRIGAN. 
Performed by HARRTGAN & HART. 
Oh, see our style and dashing figures, 
We always travel with the upper ten, 
Don't you think we're extraordinary niggers? 
We're easy, careless, colored gentlemen. 
We was raised quite young with our fathers and our mothers, 
Ever since we was a 
little picayune; 
We never had no sisters, we never had no brothers, 
We're as lively and as smart as a 
cricket or a 
coon. 
CITORUS. 
Oh! my gracious, can't we sling a 
yam, 
Oh I 
hallelujah, watch these black and tan: 
It's easy for to see these niggers ain't a 
sham— 
Were easy, careless colored gentlemen. 
Oh, you ought to see us when we're out, 
At Saratoga in the Summer time; 
For champagne wine we both do shout, 
We're " A 1" darkies, and extra superfine. 
The ladies all say, as we pass 'em every day. 
That we are quite elegant and mighty high flowr,, 
They nod and they smile. and keep winking all the \--.1111e, 
For we're just as much attraction as a 
bottle of cologne. 
Oh. my gracious, etc.

Sweet Potteen, you deceiver,

Since the day when first I 
met you, 
You threw o'er me a

You're winning, you're enticing, 
As soft as Asia silk,

As the baby loves its milk.

Drink to your friends, 
The dew from the mountain stream;

Upon my soul you'd never stop,

Old Bacchus, you deluder, 
With all your coaxing ways, 
You've enslaved me liked a

When brought within my gaze; 
Wid whiskey I'm so frisky, 
From my head down to my toes, 
I'd praise you, oh my darling, 
To your friends or to your Les.

Grandpa's chair is vacant. 
Near the fire in the grate; 
Where he told his tales of boyhood, 
Kept the little ones awake. 
One eve, so worn and weary, 
Sleeping on his knee they lay, 
Death called that night, like the itre bright, 
Grandpa passed away. 
CHORUS. 
So let the room be cheerful, 
Place the old arm chair 
Where we talked to Grandpa, 
With his silvery snow white hair. 
How he'd watch the falling ashes, 
And sadly meditate, 
Gently sigh, we all must die, 
Like the fire i21 the grate. 
One bitter night in winter, 
The snow fell fast and wild; 
A 
girl looked in the window, 
A careworn, hapless child; 
Then Grandpa whispered " baby," 
And toddled to the gate, 
To save from sin, he brought her in, 
Near the fire in the grate. 
So let the room, etc. 
Keep the fire burning, 
'Tis charity's bright flame; 
Reminding of the evening 
The orphan Mary came, 
So ragged, cold and hungry, 
With Grandpa from the gate; 
For him she kneels, a 
prayer she yields, 
Near the fire in the grate. 
So let the room, etc.

SKATING ON ONE IN THE GUTTER. 
Give Me the Man with an Honest Heart. 
A SERIO COMIC SONG. 
Written, composed and sung by Gus. W ILLIAMS. 
Copyright, 1871', by E. It HARDING, 229 Bowery, opposite 
Prince Street, N. Y. 
Price 10 cents. 
When I 
was a 
boy, 
was brimful of fun, 
For all sorts of tricks I 
was noted; 
From morning till evening I 
never was done, 
On rollicking pleasure I 
doted. 
I 
tried every game, and when winter time came, 
With joy I 
was all in a 
flutter, 
Then out on the ice, Oh, I 
tell you ' twas nice, 
I 
went skating on one in the gutter. 
CHORUS. 
Skatifig on one, skating on one, 
Oh, boys, there was never such glorious fun; 
All other pleasures of youth I 
would shun, 
And go skating on o'ne in the gutter. 
I 
beat all the boys with my far-fetching stride, 
In fact I 
was never artistic; 
While backward and forward so graceful did glide, 
I 
thought every motion majestic. 
I 
cared not to skate on the rink or the park,' 
You may believe its the truth which I 
utter, 
The best of all pleasures from daylight till dark, 
Was skating on one in the gutter. ' 
Skating on one, etc. 
To join in the sport I 
would loiter from school, 
And gain the great wrath of my master; 
Sometimes on the ice I 
would get a 
great fall, 
And go home for a 
piece of shin plaster. 
And oft through the day, I 
would steal soft away, 
With a 
hungry boy's balm, bread and butter, 
To meet my companions, so noisy and gay, 
And go skating on one in the gutter. 
Skating on one, etc. 
• 
As sung by FRANK LEWIS. 
Give me the man with an honest heart, 
I 
care not what he be, 
He may be rich, he may be poor, 
It matters not to me; 
He may not wear a 
silken vest, 
Or boast of high degree, 
But if he owns an honest heart, 
His nature's all to me. 
CHORUS. 
All praise then be to him 
Who acts a 
noble part, 
For a 
right good man is he, 
Who owns an honest heart. 
What if a 
man can learning boast, 
And wealth of golden ore, 
Yet, if he lacks an honest heart, 
I 
call him still but poor; 
Speak not to me of wealth and rank, 
They are bubbles on the sea, 
And man may dwell in gilded halls, 
But may not honest be. 
All praise then, etc. 
Now if he owns an honest heart, 
So gentle, true and kind, 
We need not search the wide world o'er, 
A 
better man to find. 
Then give to every man his due, 
Who acts an honest plan, 
It is the heart and not the coat 
That makes the honest man. 
All praise then, etc.

Some folks will cry ‘• Oh! shame, Mrs. Jones, you are to blame, 
never should have thought it, ma'am, of you," 
While, if they'd look at home before abroad they'd roam, 
I'm positive they'd have enough to do. 
Mrs. Brown says it's a 
sin, that Mrs. Smith thinks gin, 
And harbors - tally- men " from day to day; 
While Mrs. Green was caught doing what she hadn't ought, 
When she in self defenes was heard to say— 
CHORUS. 
"They all do it, they all do it, 
They all do it, though ofttimes they rue it; 
Yet they all do it, they all do it, 
And so it will continue to the end of the world!" 
For hours three or four, lovers 1! pooning at the door, 
On any moonlight evening may be seen; 
Though if they want a 
lark, they have it in the dark, 
And they " do it," though they say " they didn't mean," 
When creeping down the stairs, comes the old man unawares, 
And kissing catch the couple in the act; 
The mother, from above, says " Don't interfere, my love, 
You can't dispute this most important fact—" 
They all do it, etc.

Old women do declare, girls should never dye their hair, 
And then again they say it's very wrong; 
Without the least restraint, their faces so to paint, 
And rob the easy chair for their chignon. 
Each girl a 
little puff, has inside a 
little muff, 
They are never seen without it, night or day; 
And her pretty nose she'll powder, if a 
moment is allowed her, 
When, if you laugh, she'll innocently say— 
They all do it, etc, 
But what does most impress, is the style in which they dress, 
It's enough to make you laugh when them you see; 
They've a 
hat upon their heads, large enough to make up beds, 
For pussy cats with kittens two or three. 
In their panniers, too, behind, if examined you would find, 
The most important papers of the day; 
The Chronicle and Chimes, the Telegraph and Times, 
Or anything that chance puts in their way. 
They all do it, etc. 
There's my neighbor, Dinah Down, brught two lovely boys to 
town, 
And her husband gets but one pound one per week; 
You often hear him say, " If things go on this way, 
We'll a 
lodging in the Union have to seek! 
For the doctor and the nurse, will drain my scanty purse, 
With many more expenses to defray:" 
Then he gets into a 
passion, when they tell him " it's the 
fashion," 
And they soothe him as they sing this truthful lay— 
They all do it, etc.

Our ACTORS and ACTRESSES that are Gone, 
Respectfully dedicated to Mr. W. IL MORTON, 
Theatre Comique, Washington, D. C. 
A companion song to the Minstrel Band, an original song, 
as sung by FRANK LEWIS, 
at the Howard Athem-eum, Boston, Mass. 
I HAVE sung of the minstrels who have all passed away, 
Whose names I 
love to recall, 
Of Bryant, Seymour and Unsworth, 
And Eph. Horn, the last of them all. 
But now as a 'token of sorrow I'll sing, 
Of our actors and actresses that are fled, 
Of the bright mimic heroes who have stood on these boards, 
But whose memory shall never be dead. 
Then success to the stage, and the people who win, 
Upon it a 
record and name, 
Who gain for themselves while our memory shall last, 
A 
seat in the temple of fame. 
There's an actress now gone to the land of the blest, 
The foot-lights will see her no more, 
As a 
true artist, she well stood the test, 
But the day of her triumph is o'er. 
Meg Merrilles now is a 
thing of the past, 
For the queen of the stage, she is gone, 
And none is left to wear the gold crown, 
Charlotte Cushman so often has worn. 
CHORUS. 
There's America's tragedian, who so nobly has worked, 
To win on the stage a 
great name, 
The late Edwin Forrest deservedly has gained, 
A seat in the temple of fame. 
Lucille Western has gone, but her name ne'er forgot, 
Shall be written in letters of gold. 
Mrs. Conway, Brooklyn's favorite actress also, 
But in song shall her triumph be told. 
Claude Burroughs was found when the day-light appeared, 
As he lay by the side of his friend, 
harry Murdoch he died, as the flames he defied, 
And his drama of life was at end. 
CHORUS. 
There is also another, may his name ever be, ) 
As his own native island kept green, 
Our favorite Irish Comedian, Barney Williams now holds, 
A seat in the temple of fame..?

To dat dear old Cabin floor, 
When de shadow of de sun came peeping in: 
At night, when all was dark, 
We would hear de watch-dog bark. 
And we'd listen to the murmur of the wind. 
It seem to say to me. 
"You people must be free," 
For de happy time am coming, Lord be praised! 
For then we would weep and moan, 
For our souls was not our our own, 
In dem agonizing, cruel slav'ry days.

I 
am very old and feeble, 
And our life am nearly done; 
I 
have travell'd in the roughest kind of road; 
Through sicknees, toil and Eorrow 
I 
have reach' de end at last, 
And I'm resting by de wayside wid my load. 
Forget now and forgive, 
Has always been my guide, 
For dat's what de scripture surely says; 
But our meary will turn roun, 
When our souls dey were tied down.

Written and sung by Ilzatax BENNETT. 
You see before you a 
iolly old man, 
My age is sevetty-two; 
I 
ne'er let sorrow remain in my heart, 
And I 
never am sad or blue; 
I've wrestled with fortune many a 
year— 
Of trouble I've had a 
good share ; 
But I 
smokes my pipe, and drinks ray be.-
For misfortune 
misfortune I 
do not care. 
Folde lol, lot de lol, dum t1 
1,tra day, 
I 
sing and dance all my sorrows away; 
I 
like to be merry, jolly and gay— 
Fol de lol, lot de lol, dum de dum day. 
Some people meet all their troubles half way, 
And always are borrowing woe; 
And that is the reason their hair turns gray, 
And their spirits do get so low. 
Now take my advice, give. 
care a 
wide berth, 
Let your hearts be happy and light ; 
For nothing is gained by crying, you know, 
So keep your eyes sparkling and bright.

MOUND OF ROSES. 
Written by ANDY McREE, for SAM MARTIN, America's Most Won. 
derful and Artistic One Legged Song and Dance Artist, and Jig Dancer. 
THE shades of night had fallen, 
The dew was on the'ground, 
'Twos near a 
bed of roses, 
I 
saw while gazing round 
A 
figure pass before me, 
I 
scarcely heard a 
sound, 
She seemed to gather roses, 
From off a 
little mound. 
CHORUS. 
She spoke—her voice it charmed me, 
Then to my side did bound, 
" 
You're welcome to a 
flower, 
From off my rosy mound." 
I 
drew her mantle closer, 
Around her beauteous form, 
That I 
might keep her near me, 
And kiss that hand so warm. 
She passed her little arm through mine, 
We walked the garden round, 
She said I 
might assist her, 
To pick roses from her mound. 
Oh now we have a 
garden, 
Which all belongs to me, 
And several little gardeners] 
That's beautiful to see, 
And should you want some flowers, 
I 
hope you'll call around, 
And gather those to suit you, 
From off our little mound.

DANCING 
Written and sung by En. HARRIGAN. 
I 
was once the queen of the ballet so gay, 
The greatest artist ever seen on the stage; 
In the art Terpsichore, a 
sweet beauty in fact, • 
I 
set the whole town in a 
rage. 
Engaged by Jarrett and Palmer each week, 
To do the solos in the Crook; 
I 
would fascinate your dears, 
With my loving, languishing look. 
CHORUS. 
Dancing in the ballet, 
The beautiful Parisian ballet, 
I 
was the queen, La belle Pauline, 
Dancing in the ballet. 
My name on the bills was Silvina Malki, 
My real name was Johannah McGee; 
So fluent I 
speak the French language, oh my, 
That's warbled in Tip-per-rare- e. 
The young men would call me a 
dazzler so sweet, 
Delightful, entrancing they'd say, 
Now I'm forced to make shirts for the supers I 
meet, 
Considered by all en passe. 
Dancing in the ballet, & c. 
I 
was so bewitchingly, graceful and neat, 
in slow movements 4ny x,vers, Its there I 
excel'. 
Mountains of bouquets and flowers so sweet, 
Was thrown to this pretty gazelle. 
The young girls would say, what a 
beauty and sigh, 
As around on my toes I 
would spin; 
Tr the back line of ballet, I'll stop till I 
die, 
Because I'm so dreadfully thin. 
Dancing in the ballet, & c. 
When standing amidst the coryphees there, 
make such a 
sweet-looking fairy-like queen' 
Could stand on the end of a 
needle, 
And turn or float in cloud in the air. 
My dresses were made and brought out from Paris, 
Most gorgeously trimmed round with gold; 
Now I'm in the back line of the ballet, 
simply because I 
am old. 
Dancing in the ballet. 
PUFFY TO THE FRONT. 
EIARRIGAN'S great song, as sung in his play of "MALONE'S 
NIGHT OFF." 
Copyright 1876, by A. 
J. 
FISHER, 98 Nassau Street, New York 
Cornelius Duffy, the people's choice, 
A 
substantial, solid man, 
Will represent our government. 
And surely lead the van ; 
His head is full of learning, 
his constituents all agree, 
he'll hold the chair and rule it there, 
Far up in Albany. ' 
CHORUS. 
Then rise your voices every one, 
The enemy we will hunt, 
We'll rule New York, ah that's the talk, 
When Dufly's to the front. 
You can drink your lager on Sunday then, 
And speak your mind at will, 
You can fight all night, till broad day-light, 
The police can't keep you still; 
Your influence will be powerful, 
Led by a 
man of ability, 
When Cornelius Duffy's to the front, 
Far up in Albany. 
CHORUS.

many times he's actually forced to say "my darling," when he don't 
mean it: see the new clothes he has to wear out when he ain't 
in the house; see the terrible amount of duels he has to fight 
with tailors and shoemakers—why, it's enough to dissect him. 
See the chances be takes at boarding-houses on the you-rope-in

WHAT I 
KNOW ABOUT FARMING. 
Burlesque Oration by ED. HARRIGAN. 
Co-laborers and tillers of the soil—we meet and I 
trust, 
not the Tribune, but you lend your ears (and three or four dol-
lars) to the cause of farming. (Bus) 
A farm, my friends, is composed of mud or dirt, and is called 
by some eminent philosophers, land. 
I 
suppose they have sub-
stantial grounds for their lay-out. (
Bus) 
Farming was introduced first in a 
town called Eden. 
It's not 
down on the map, and never was interviewed. 
The farmer's 
name was Adam; he had one wife, Eva. 
Adam never was 
Mormonized, and, they do say he raised the largest pippins and 
rusty- coat apples in that district. 
Adam didn't succeed well at 
farming, simply because he pulled the apples before they were 
ripe. 
It was on that farm we got the first pair, but the farms of 
Long Branch and Saratoga can raise more Belle Pairs than 
Adam did. (I 
thought I'd ring the Belle in once, as I'm mighty 
fond of 'em.) 
Now, my friends, let us wade into beans—a 
Isoup-a-fluous fruit. 
The bean was first introduced by the Pilgrim Fathers, who 
brought a 
ship load over with 'em, and while the ahip lay at 
11-
51 
anchor, she sprung a 
leak, and the beans wouldn't mingle with 
a 
leek. 
They skedaddled in the water, where they formed a 
club or a 
rock, and every bean on 'ern was a 
brick. 
(Aside— 
Page 
New York Riots.) 
Well, the Pilgrims landed in the 
morning on beans, and called them Plymouth Rock— I've bean 
there. 
The bean factories of NIassachusetts have done a 
flour-
ishing business since that day—that is, if we take the word of 
Bean-jamin F., of Lowell. (Bus) 
The next thing we have before us is the potato, called in 
Latin, Murphy° or Fogarty°, where we get the Greek of the 
Latin and Irish translation, thus :—Fo, Fogo, Fogardus, and 
Fogarty! 
If you don't believe it, go ask Fogarty ; he keeps 
the little saloon around the corner. 
It is a 
substantial fruit, 
and it came from Cork, an Irish town in Italy, where it was 
devoured with great eclat by the cannibals of that place. 
It is 
highly recommended for corns and bunnions. 
It will produce 
a 
bunnion on your nasal organ when thrown with the gentlest 
force. (Bus) 
Now let us take Salary; there is no family should be with-
out it—not even the Dent family. 
During a 
conversation with 
General Grant, he informed me confidentially that his relations 
kept eating salary, while he kept saying, " Lettuce have peas.' 
You take a 
bundle of Salary, and you will observe it covered 
with a 
green back and tied up with Bonds. It's generally taken 
by senators and politicians as a 
relish. 
I 
must say I 
like it 
myself. (Bus) 
The next fruit we demonstrate is the Beet. 
Beets were first 
found and planted by our government. They stand any amount 
of wear and tear. 
They have to be beat to make 'em fit to 
swallow. 
They are an idle fruit, and hard to get rid of; • they lay 
on your hands a 
long time. There are different classes of beets 
there is the full round plump beet, the spruce spicy beet, the 
turned- up beet, and the hotel beet, which are served up at 
hotels. 
The principal beet is the dead beet; they weigh from 
one hundred to four hundred pounds, and the market is gener-
ally overrun with 'em. 
I 
admit- I've been taken in on beets; 
but I 
have had many a 
beet taken in to get even. (Bus) 
5, 
The next thing before us is the Onion. " In Onion there is 
Strength." 
The onion was first discovered at Lexington, and 
it has grown in size and strength since that day. 
It has made 
us shed tears many a 
day. 
But still we love our onion. 
Its 
breath is strong and sweet, and covers up a 
great deal of ground. 
They tried hard to dig the onions up in the southern country, 
but it's root was so strong it wouldn't be dug. 
It's a 
fruit that 
will stand a 
heap of preserving—yes, a 
heap— a 
heap of pre-
serving. 
So I 
ask you, one and all to go farming. Some of you 
might say, " what on?" I 
answer, on anything. 
If you have 
to sell your false teeth, your wife's false hair, your shoes—buy 
a 
farm. 
Git West! 
Go w—ay out West! 
Go where the 
Rocky Mountains, with their snow-capped pinnacles of might:-
elevated dizziness, looks down with supreme disgust on the 
herds of buffalo that bellow on the Western prairie. 
I've heard 
'em—so's Alexis. 
Yes, let the young and old, and old and 
young, git West! 
You'll git a 
farm for twenty-two dollars and 
a 
hal f, close figures. 
Oh, my friends, think of the beauties of farming I In the 
balmy Indian Summer, you can set by your wigwam, like 
Minnehaha, the Indian basket- maker's daughter, and sew quilts. 
And, amid the dark and languishing smoke of a 
Henry Clay 
pipe, you kiss your wife and babe, and haste to the village, and 
get drunk on pressed cider, (only five cents a 
pail.) 
And, if 
you ain't married, whar can you get a 
wife like a 
farmer's off-
spring ? She mi!ks the cows, she feeds the pigs, she eats seven 
times a 
day. 
Whar can you get such another appetite? 
I 
repeat with increased vehemence, git West! Go plough, mow, 
reap, and sew—your own clothes. 
THE STARS OF THE PERIODi 
Dedicated to Harrigan and Hart 
By EDWARD AUSTIN. 
Hasten for seats, do not delay, 
Great artists are in town to-day ; 
And high upon the roll of fame, 
Resplendent shines their well-known name! 
Refinement's air pervades their acts, 
And what they do no neatness lacks; 
Reputation great they've earned and made, 
No one throws them in the shade! 
In their great act, ":-:. lavery Days," 
Deafning applause they're sure to raise. 
Go and see the " Blue and Gray," 
Clasping hands in bright array; 
And " The Sixty Ninth" ( the " gallant,") 
Observe the boys possess men's talent. 
Nature, Harrigan has surely blest, 
-Made him " different from the rest," 
And by his own majestic sway, 
Banish, he will, all care away. 
Next comes Tony, who sings so wall, 
In dancing, none can him excel; 
Devoid of all that's stale or low, 
No rival does this artist know. 
Homage should to both be paid 
Astonishing is " The Day Parade ;" 
And other sketches they will do 
That are to life and nature true. 
Remember, the music of excellent worth 
In the mind of Braham had its birth; 
Then the manager of this great team— 
Obliging Hanley—deserves esteem ! 
S 
ATISFACTION, great, is given to all— 
Now don't fo..rset this night to call.

W ILLIAM SCANLAN, at the Olympic Theatre, Broadway, N. Y. 
Music published by JOHN. PERRY, Washington St., opposite Boston 
Theatre, Boston, Mass. 
The theatre was full—it was Dorkins' night--
That is, Dorking was going to appear 
At night, in a 
favorite comedy part, 
For he was comedian here. 
Funny I 
why, he'd make you laugh, till the tears 
Ran down your face like rain; 
And every time he came on the stage, 
You'd try to stop laughing in vain. 
A family? yes, he'd a 
family, 
And he lov'd them as dear as his life; 
And you'd scarcely find a 
happier lot 
Than Dorkins' children and wife. 
And you'd scarcely find a 
happier lot 
Than Dorkins' children and wife. 
There came one night, and I 
was in front, 
And Dorkins was going to play 
A character new to himself and the stage, 
Which he'd trod for many a 
day. 
By eight the theatre was perfectly jammed, 
All awaited a 
pleasant surprise; 
For they knew they'd laugh ' till their sides would ache 
And they long'd for the curtain to rise. 
The play soon began—each neck was stretched forth, 
And eagerly watched each eye, 
For Dorkins to make his first entrance, and then 
To give him a 
cheerful hi! hi! 
For Dorkins to make his first entrance, and the). 
To give him a 
cheerful hi! hi I 
At last he appeared, amid loud applause, 
But something was wrong you could see; 
" 
Why, Dorkins is playing quite badly .to-night I" 
The people said, sitting ' round me. 
A hiss ! yes, it was; I 
saw Dorkins start 
As if stung by a 
serpent's fang; 
And he'd cast a 
beseeching look all 'round, 
While his head on his breast he would hang. 
" 
He's drunk !" some one said, and I 
thought so myself, 
For, to me, it was awful at times, 
To see how he'd struggle along with his part, 
And continually stick in his lines, 
To see how he'd struggle along with his part, 
And continually stick in his lines. 
The footlights, at last, he approached very slow, 
And, " Ladies and gentlemen." said— 
"If I 
cannot please you to- night, 
The fault's not the heart, but the head. 
There's many a 
night I've made you all laugh, 
When so ill I 
could scarcely well stand; 
And every effort was pain to me then— 
Yes, if even I'd raise but my hand. 
You hiss me to-night, and say that I'm drunk," 
From his heart came a 
sob and a 
moan; 
" 
I'll tell you the reason—I 
know you won't laugh— 
I've a 
little one dying at home! 
I'll tell you the reason—I 
know you won't laugh— 
I've a 
little one dying at home!" 
THE BLOODLESS DUEL, 
FRANK LEwts's Great Song. 
'TWAS a 
cold winter's night, when King Frost held the sway, 
And darkness it reigned all around, 
A 
mysterious man with revenge in his, mind 
Did wait till his victim was found. 
Waiting, he'd sworn he would wait till the dawn, 
For the man who had promised to wed 
The sister he loved, and he vowed in his wrath, 
lie would ' punch" the young editor's head. 
At last a 
tall figure appeared on the steps, 
As down to his sleigh he di,i 
But he scarcely had gained the sidewalk. ere a 
blow 
Caused him in the gutter to lie. 
The mysterious man cried ." Revenge I 
will have 
And the wrongs of my sister efface." 
And 
May " to " December," he quickly did turn 
In a 
map on the editor's face. 
Fighting, they fought, as young heroes did tight. 
In the glorious days of old Greece. 
When to part them, alas, not a " cop" was in sight, 
Nor a 
blue-coated squad of police. 
The poor man was lifted up by his friends, 
They his story of wrong tried to draw-. 
lie muttered, " The girl I 
did love as my life 
But could not stand that old mother-in-law." 
The scene it is changed to a 
bleak turnip field, 
And grim death, hovered high in the air. 
Not knowing which State, human blood would be shed, 
Maryland, or the great Delaware. 
Slaughter, yes that was the name of the town, 
Where the foemen were ready to fight, 
57 
But they stood such a 
distance, where the seconds them placed 
That they seemed for to be out of sight. 
Blood-thirsty, you bet, for red blood it was shed, 
• 
The foeman they can't explain how. 
At the word, quick they tired, but a 
strange thing to say, 
The only man shot was a 
cow. 
Gordon Bennett he winked, Fred May blew his nose, 
Their hearts with forgiveness did swell, 
They threw down their pistols, ran quick o'er the snow, 
Into each others arms quick they fell. 
Dr. Phelps then his surgical instrument drew, 
Not a 
ball from the men to pull back, 
But to put it by far, to a 
much better nse, 
A 
cork from a 
bottle extract. 
They all did shake hands, ana soon started for home, 
With blood- thirsty duels content, 
..t1Jad the world still moves on, though the battle is o'er.

George Barnwell, THE MERCHANT'S CLERK. --ThiS is an 
extremely sensational sketch, but shows Truth stranger than Fiction. 
This deluded victim went from crime to crime with a 
fearful rapidity, 
urged by the baneful influences of women lost to honor. He realized 
every moment the evils of his course, but, like a 
bird fluttering over the 
basilisk eye of the serpent, he went down, down, into the vortex of ruin 
and despair. 
This book teaches, in the strongest way, the moral lesson 
of resisting that temptation, which comes arrayed like an " angel of 
light"—beautiful to the eye, and blasting to the soul... • Price 25 Cents.

arranged so systematically, and in 
accompanied with directions so plainly written that, with a 
single pe-
rusal, any person may become an adept in an unfailing source of 
amusement. Read what a 
leading Journal says of it: 
" 
an ingenious little book of the thaumaturgic order, has been sent us, 
called ' Hunirry DIIMPTY,' and bound in such a 
way as to give opportn• 
nity for a 
decidedly puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary sp. 
pearance of a 
child's picture book, gaily printed and colored, it is ** 
bound that a 
practised manipulator taking it up and flirting thi, leavee 
over, can make it appear to be filled only with one picture, or with blank 
pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of figures. 
One minute the 
pamphlet, quickly thumbed, appears to contain nothing but the portrait 
of Harlequin, in his tesselated suit; the next only Columbine, then 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or Mephistophiles. A MU( 
practice, and the directions printed with the book will make anybody 
at home in the handling of it."—Phil. Eve. Bull..
