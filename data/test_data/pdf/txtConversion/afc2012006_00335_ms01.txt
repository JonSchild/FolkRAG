David C Morrell interview conducted by Anthony G. Potoczniak 
2012-07-31 
  
 [0:00] David Morrell (DM) is the creator and developer of the pilot scheduling system called 
HarborLights.  
  
 [0:24] DM shares recent success of expanding HarborLights to the Galveston Port Authority, 
which just approved to adopt the harbor management system. Describes the system 
components of the software: the order and billing systems.  
  
 [01:30] Harborlights (HL) is a scheduling system, which incorporates ship pilot data. The ship 
pilot is the primary point of service at the POH that engages an incoming vessel. HL helps to 
optimize port service and increases security by having more eyes on the ship while at the POH.  
  
 [03:55] Explains how ship information is displayed in the system. Original database for 
dispatchers was put together by ship pilot Capt. Lou Vest. The colorization of the dispatch 
system -- how information is represented -- inspired the name HarborLights. Colors assigned to 
ease analysis for the dispatcher to understand where the ship is in the process. DM tried to 
make logic of the colors, i.e., I made the tankers green, because they represented money; red 
represents emergency or hazardous, so when you take red and green and combine them, that 
makes a chemical tanker. These schemes were designed within the commercial environment to 
be able to assess quickly the status of a ship.  
  
 [06:45] Describes how and by whom information accessed: determined by function and 
business -- the pilots, tugs, and mooring companies.  
  
 [08:10] Lou Vests prototype database system tracked ship movement. HL expanded this basic 
idea by adding more data to the system.  
  
 [09:10] Describes the optimization of the ordering process, i.e., linking Lloyds shipping 
database to the HL system; ships still require verification by the pilot, this information also 
becomes part of the HL database.  
  
 [11:05] Shares historical process of how vessels were verified: pilots used paper cards to relay 
information about the ship, pilots verify the accuracy of the information by checking the ships 
placard located at the wheelhouse; charge for services is based on accuracy information about 
the ships tonnage and length of beam.  
  
 [13:25] Describes how tracking ships in the Houston Ship Channel has changed over time. The 
Marine Exchange was a beach house located at Morgans Point -- nearest point of access to the 
channel, and run 24/7 mostly by retired women, who reported ships going in/out of the port.  
  
 [15:02] Explains how ships were being tracked, discovers the problem with the docks, and how 
this information was important to all constituents involved.

 [19:02] DM explains how he joined the Houston Pilots in 1996. First projects were related to 
data recovery. Overtime, he observed how busy it got in the dispatch area, especially when a 
lot of ships appeared at the same time: This place can really be a madhouse!  
  
 [22:10] Describes how the dispatch area worked when the POH was closed down: The phone 
never stopped ringing... Agents and dispatchers have to work to re-schedule the delays.  
  
 [24:58] Compares pre-Harborlights era with the current system: HL gave the ability to research 
the vessel to complete an accurate order without the experience needed to be acquired over 
the years.  
  
 [26:57] Shares the experience of observing and learning the day-to-day work of dispatchers: 
determined a way to optimize the system. The goal was to increase access to information, in a 
secure way, to all the different stakeholders (agents, tugs, pilots): if the main scheduling 
services know exactly what’s happening up to the minute as far as changes to the vessel, then it 
gives them a little more time to utilize their manpower. In most cases, up to 4-hours notice. 
Describes the earlier HTML version of HL postings: it kept the phone calls down a lot. DM 
determined that it would been hard to develop Harborlights without this rudimentary system of 
displaying real-time information.  
  
 [32:16] Timeline of HL implementation: initially a lot of reservation in releasing scheduling 
information: pilots worried about the accuracy, shipping agents were upset, because they did 
not want competing agents in their business. As a result HL had to be taken down for a brief 
time. One of the largest shipping companies (Moran Shipping Agencies, Inc.) decided to share 
their information, convincing others players to share their information.  
  
 [35:15] DM describes the automation of the maritime industry based on regional tours of other 
Ports and their scheduling systems. HL tracks information not found in other port systems: pilot 
rotation, pilot certification, certified deputies for operating certain vessels.  
  
 [38:06] DM describes the eight-year process of creating a patent for Harborlights, and the 
challenge of completing the process.  
  
 [41:01] Discusses the process incorporating Automatic Identification System (AIS) data into HL 
to create a visualization of the ships. DMs daughter, a gifted mathematician, helps to decode 
the encrypted data.  
  
 [45:00] DM describes the process a programmer learned the intricacies of the shipping 
industry, and how HL was developed to reflect the work culture of the Houston Pilots: I had the 
questions, they had the answers.  
  
 [50:55] DM shares story of the first days working on the project that would later become 
Harborlights: When we first got here, there was nothing on a piece of paper that said that this

was a rule or restriction. It just seemed to be in everybody’s head. Without getting that 
information from a pilot, it was going to be impossible to do. He states: Unless you can make 
sense of it, you can’t put it to logic. DM describes the interview process working with the pilots. 
Additional description of how the linemen, tugs, and pilots practices have changed over time.  
  
 [55:06] Discusses the Port of Galveston Authority and the prospect of expanding HL to other 
ports; how the system will become more efficient for billing, scheduling, and verification -- a 
checks and balance between the figures, which is more accurate for the whole industry.  
  
 [59:15] Description of critical historical moments in the past decade, and how they impacted 
the development or operation of HL: closing the port: 9/11, hurricanes.  
  
 [01:01:15] DM shares story about 9/11, when the Port of Houston computers were being 
hacked, forcing the closure of the entire port. Relates the story of how the FBI and Scotland 
Yard used computer logs from HL in the prosecution of Aaron Caffrey - the lovesick hacker.  
  
 [1:05:04] Further description of the Denial of Service (DOS) attack on the HLs servers. After DM 
reports this activity to the authorities, the shipping industries were shut down several days.  
  
 [1:07:27] DM describes how he got interested in electronics and programming. Influence from 
his youth, when a good friend of his had a side-job of buying broken stereos and TVs, and fixing 
them. He thought: that’s a really good career, I think I can make a career out of that. Moved to 
California, attended a program at Addington Labs for two years. Moved back in Houston in 
1979, joined IBM, where he worked in department that maintained mainframes.  
  
 [01:13:04] More information about DMs career: married in 1983, worked in an emerging field 
of digitizing web logs of various oil industries. Worked at several companies that specialized in 
digitizing seismic and well logs, developed new scanner technologies. Unemployed, DM began 
to work in the computer service industry.  
  
 [1:18:22] DM joined the Court of Appeals, revamping the opinion system, so it could be used 
on a shared computer network.  
  
 [1:20:15] DM discusses Harborlights as the largest project: We put in more effort into HL, 
because of the sheer need. The industry didn’t have it. Describes other projects with Pipe Sales 
Inventory, and developing software that improved the companies work flow and accuracy of 
data.  
  
 [1:26:37] Describes his work in the Life Gift Foundation, which keeps track of organ donations.  
  
 [1:29:13] Concludes interview by stressing the family-like atmosphere of the Houston Pilots 
and the sense of belonging he experiences at the Houston Pilots.  
  
 [1:30:39] Conclusion of interview.
