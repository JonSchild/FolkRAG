INTRODUCTION
 
It probably takes 10,000 little girls playing "Fur Elise" on the piano
 
to produce one Dame Myra Hess.  Exactly why this i
s so is not totally clear,
 
but at least two factors emerge as important.  First, the social desirability
 
of piano-playing has to be publicly established and accepted before the
 
Myra Hesses among the 10,000 will dare to identify themselves.  Second, the
 
pedagogical, economic, and distributional support structures have t
o be manned
 
by t
he other  9
,999 in order for a Dame Myra's artistry to be thoroughly and
 
efficiently developed.
 
The most notable examples of all arts and all art f
orms are not skyrockets
 
but atolls, the tips of submerged mountains.  And there is no way to say which
 
is more important t
o a mountain - the base or the top.
 
All this i
s not exactly news.  The Arts Endowment has struggled with the
 
problem of the vastness of the arts continuum ever since its founding.  Such
 
Council members as Gunther Schuller have argued with passion and eloquence
 
that we must pay primary attention to the entire s
ocial climate wherein the
 
arts can flourish.  He calls our proper area of concern "education" in its
 
widest sense.  Others have maintained with equal conviction that, with our
 
limited resources, we can only cultivate the very t
ops of the mountain peaks;
 
thus, the proliferation of individual fellowships.
 
Folk Arts has always s
eemed t
o me like a miniature Endowment.  We have
 
every one of the problems, in a small f
orm but bewildering number.  Statistically,
 
we're close t
o hopeless.  Our most reliable datum i
s that 100`
i of all Americans
 
have practiced some f
orm of folk art at one time or another (
sung a lullaby,
 
told an old story, whittled a chain, whistled a tune, danced a square, "
fooled
 
around" on an instrument).  These are our "Fur Elise" players, and they are
 
omnipresent.
 
2
 
The number of folk artists -- our Myra Hesses -- is undoubtedly finite
 
but hard t
o pin down, since we potentially support all the traditional art
 
forms of all the art-producing groups in the nation, including every tribe,
 
ethnicity, linguistic, and racial family from the Chamorros to the Serbo-
Croations, from the Eskimos to the Mennonites.  The maintenance of alternate
  
aesthetic systems is our central concern.
 
On the eve of commencing our fifth year as a formal Endowment Program,
 
we believe ourselves t
o be in pretty good shape.  Our guidelines are working
 
well; we had set out first thing to reinforce the base of that mountain and it
 
is getting stronger every day.  Now, without relaxing in any wav our concern
  
for the substructure evidenced in our present guidelines, we must turn cart
 
of our attention to the peaks and to the various crumbly bits.
 It is a good
 
time for a major program review.
 
OVERALL FUNDING STRATEGIES
 
1
.  Eighty to ninety percent of our grants will continue to be in the
 
form of matching funds to organizations.  The development of support structures
  
on every level is our major need, and this is one proven way of stimulating
 
their growth.
 Soft match and partial match will continue to be acceptable;
 
we are dealing with economically marginal organizations in many cases.  T
;e
 
are already seeing the payoff from the intelligent fiscal counselling and
 
lessons in how to budget provided by our extraordinarily dedicated staff.
 
2
.  Perhaps 7
5% of all Folk Arts activities are actually or potentially
 
self-supporting, and we are anxious to keep them that way.  Both federal and
 
state support should ideally be reserved for emerging efforts or special
 
occasions.  The bulk of our support, then, will continue to be limited to
 
two or three years for the same project.
 
- 3 -
 
3
.  The state folk arts coordinator program has proved even more
 
successful than predicted in luring out state and local support moneys.  It
 
appears, therefore, that we will eventually be engaged in cooperative
 
programmatic and funding relationships of one kind or another with independent
 
state-based f
olk arts programs in all the states.  At one time we had speculated
 
on some sort of a future block grant program.  Our current experience suggests
 
that i
t would be wiser t
o think in terms of a continuing, flexible one-on-one
 
relationship -- you take this and that will free us up t
o do that  sort of
 
thing.  Folk Arts believes i
t is crucial t
o keep both federal and s
tate support
  
mechanisms in place and in balance. Local funding i
s always desirable, but state
 
governments are t
oo susceptible t
o the political process t
o entrust them with
 
the entire responsibility for support of minority art forms.  We've been pretty
 
successful so far in developing positive and workable relationships with s
tate
 
agencies.
 
4
.  It seems highly unlikely that Folk Arts will ever attract any measure
 
of corporate or private support; this i
s one reason the Program has spent so much
 
energy c
oaxing out state monies.  An optimistic development is the gradually
 
increasing interest in Folk Arts programming shown by large institutions --
museums, concert promotion agencies, and the like.  Here we can ask for --
and get -- hard match and even over-match.
 
5
.  In the next three years, we must examine carefully the potential
 
for fiscal solvency of some of our emerging efforts.  For example, i
t may not
 
be possible f
or given ethnic tours -- provided they c
ontinue t
o perform
 
exclusively for local ethnic communities -- t
o continue without ongoing f
ederal
 
support.  It i
s possible that our two t
o three year funding limitation will have
 
t
o be raised in these cases.

OVERALL CULTURAL STRATEGIES:
 
We have only two that we've been able t
o i
dentify so far.  They overlap,
 
of course.  Thinking at this level -- unscrambling the cultural omelet --
is a pretty imprecise endeavor.
 
1
.  Framing. By encouraging exhibits, documentation through all kinds
 
of media, and various s
orts of f
ormal performances, we have in effect put a
 
frame around the flow of life in t
raditional c
ommunities and said, "Hey, you
 
didn't know it, but this thing you do i
s art." This i
s a very Western
 
European idea, of course; the Chairman observed on his trips t
o Hopi and
 
Samoa that in these places art infuses every day life t
o the point that i
t is
 
difficult t
o distinguish between the two, and -
Aargaret Mead tells us that in
 
such languages as Balinese there i
s even no available word for "art".  On
 
bad days, we tend t
o think of framing as the ultimate c
o-option of the innocent
 
by a s
ociety that i
s determined t
o make a buck out of everything it t
ouches,
 
turning every act into a salable and packageable c
ommodity.  On good days,
 
we hope that we are providing smaller cultures with a defense mechanism
 
whereby they can protect their art f
orms and carry them with them into the
 
strange future.
 
2
.  Feedback. This i
s framing turned around, s
o that the arts of the
 
people are presented back t
o the people who created them.  A
.B. Spellman
 
calls it "inreach", as opposed t
o "outreach".  It i
s probably most effectively
 
done through the media, which carry within themselves a sense of cultural
 
authority and a s
pecial dignity; but such devices as l
ocal festivals, exhibits
 
of community arts within the community e
t al also seem t
o have a strong
 
positive effect.  This has always been Folk Arts' basic s
trategy; our ethnic
 
t
our i
dea i
s a good case in point.
 
5
 
We must now decide if the time has come t
o add a strong outreach program
 
to our list of strategies.  Outreach both reinforces and corrupts simultaneously;
 
the changes essential for presentation to unfamiliar audiences modify the art
 
forms being presented.  On the other hand, they preserve them too; the approval
 
of the general public may be the essential factor in preventing severe cultural
 
loss.
 
SIGNIFICANT TRENDS:
 
1
.  Ever-increasing interest in folk arts coordinator positions on state,
 
local, and regional levels. We even have requests now f
or coordinators for
 
f
olk-artists-in-schools programs.  This is the pay-off f
or our long-maintained
 
insistence that folk arts must be treated with the same high-level critical
 
attention paid to standard disciplines.  Folk Arts are not simply "community
 
arts".  They have their own internally-recognized criteria for excellence, and
 
individual excellence is as rare, as precious, and as widely recognized among
 
Navajo weavers as it i
s among classical pianists.  More and more arts groups
 
are therefore turning to folk arts specialists to assist them in identifying
 
and supporting the highest calibre of the vast range of f
olk artists in their
 
areas.  The Folk Arts Program had first feared that this program might simply
 
result in the proliferation of mid-level bureaucrats and become yet another
 
obstacle in getting funds direct t
o artists.  We're beginning to relax about
 
that now; where the local folk arts coordinator is experienced and sensitive,
 
it i
s making the federal job easier.
 
2
.  A gradual, but significant, emergence of professional-calibre
  
appropriate-to-the-;eneral-public performing groups, museum exhibits, media
  
productions and displays of all kinds. 
"Outreach", in a sense, is being
 
forced on us, and we sometimes find ourselves in the role of assisting in the
 
development of professionalism among the folks (
in particular and special cases).
 
- 6
 
This has not, heretofore, been a s
tated aim, but, when you persuade people to
 
stick their heads up out of the tall grass, you then have t
o stand ready to
 
help them get established in the larger world, if that's what they want.
 
This is where our lack of general support organizations is so hampering.
 
3
.  A general, overall, continuing, increase of high-calibre activity in
  
every state, every region, every territory, and every one of the ethnicities
  
and special groups. Two years ago, we were beating the bushes for strong,
 
fundable applications; now, we have t
o turn them down because of fiscal
 
constraints.  It makes i
t awfully difficult t
o plan sensibly.  I
f we continue
 
t
o insist upon a two t
o three year limit for federal support, we should s
omeday
 
reach a balance point where our budget can remain level, f
or as one group drops
 
out, another can c
ome in.  Nowadays there seem t
o be ever more and more worthwhile
 
and serious groups waiting t
o come in, and we do not know how t
o e
stimate when
 
or i
f we will reach the end.
 
CURRENT PROBLZMS:
 
There are a number of previously unaddressed problems awaiting our
 
attention.  They are arranged here in the order of priority a
s recommended
 
by Folk Arts staff:
 
1
.  The classic performing arts of our Asian and African citizens.
 
At first glance, this area would s
eem t
o be completely outside t
he purview of
 
Folk Arts.  We have dabbled in i
t enough, however, t
o feel with increasing
 
conviction that ours i
s the only Endowment Program where support for these
 
art forms can logically fall, right now. Within the t
raditional context,
 
these art forms are learned t
raditionally; Asians and Africans themselves
 
do not draw t
oo many distinct lines between their f
olk (
or c
ommonly-practiced)
 
arts and their classic (
or specialized) arts.  Most of these artists and
 
artistic c
ompanies cannot qualify f
or support from other Endowment programs,
 
7
 
not because they are amateur, but because their seasons are t
oo short, they
 
are not members of the appropriate unions, their total fiscal activity is
 
t
oo small.  Still, many of them are of outstanding artistic quality; the
 
foremost artists of the Eastern world are now among us, refugees, impoverished,
 
unable t
o speak to the audiences they deserve.  Folk Arts can nurture these
 
artists and these artistic companies until they can achieve a dimension
 
whereby their support can be s
ought from Opera/Music Theater, or Dance, or
 
Music.
 
2
.  The truly "culturally deprived", those people in our society who
 
have lost their sense of cultural identity.  Most prominent among these are
 
urbanized Indians, who cluster t
ogether in multi-tribal groups, desperately
 
trying to invent or reshape cultural forms that will s
omehow, some way,
 
represent what to them is "Indian-ness".  Numbered here, t
oo, are the folks
 
from Saipan, Guam, the Northern Marianas and other areas of the Pacific,
 
whose art forms have been buried under the onslaught of Western materialism
 
so that they no longer know who they are or what they might have been.
 
Finally, this group includes Mid-America. They are the angry ones, the ones
 
who have been told for the last fifty years that their f
orefathers, whom they
 
rightfully and properly honor, despoiled the land, enslaved the blacks,
 
massacred the Indians, polluted the waters, brutalized the immigrants, all in
 
the name of opening up a new nation dedicated to freedom and justice for all.
 
Theirs is perhaps the most difficult problem.  The do have a folk culture;
 
their roots are strong and deep; s
omehow, their perception of themselves must
 
be shifted t
owards that part of their past and that Dart of their heritage of
 
which they can be rightfully proud, instead of being kept forever on the
 
defensive.
 If we solve, or even mitigate, this one, we should take over the
 
entire Endowment budget for 1
983.  Who else is even thinking of tackling it?
 
8
 
3
.  The ever-increasing number of "professional' (
defined here as folk
  
artists and crafts workers who are ready and willing t
o enter the larger
 
community of the arts).  Here, we face issues that are new to the Program,
 
primarily economic. For example, it is clear that one of the reasons our
 
crafts apprenticeship program has not worked too well is that the young
 
people simply don't see crafts as an economically viable way of life, and
 
so they don't apply in large numbers.  For another instance, i
f we were to
 
lift our restrictions on our ethnic tours and let them book mostly into colleges
 
and large community theaters, they could eventually be self-sustaining, but then
 
thev wouldn't be "ethnic t
ours" in the feedback sense, around which the idea
 
originally developed.  These are cruel dilemmas, and may demand a different
 
kind of thinking on the part of Folk Arts' staff and panelists, as well as
 
the invention of new funding patterns and procedures.
 
4
.  Emerging art forms from f
olk communities. Here we have some cheerful
 
news t
o report.  Along with the eruption of "professional" groups of really
 
traditional artists, we are seeing the growth of new and exciting crafts,
 
musics, and dance forms.  Admittedly, they have a way to go, but they're
 
moving right along and they're firmly based in the older f
orms, just as they
 
should be.  As the years go by, we intend to increase our support for these new
 
and emerging groups.
 It may mean a different funding style, but that remains
 
t
o be seen; till then, we can cope under our current guidelines.
 
S
.  Our "
sports", the ones that most people instinctively think of as "folk
 
artists".  These are the loners, the private, untutored visionaries, the
 
Grandma Moseses, the religionists, the creators of the Watts Towers and the
 
c
ountless bottle gardens all across our land.  Their proper support creates
 
s
ome major difficulties.  What, when you really come down t
o it, do they really
 
need?  In some cases, they have created civic statues that should be maintained
 
and preserved by the appropriate civic or environmental authorities; in others,
 
1
 
9
 
they have created works of private and individual visions that can only be
 
properly
 evaluated by fine arts experts.  Folk Arts keeps them in mind and
 
has helped occasionally but hasn't yet figured out a strategy for major support.
 
6
.
 The so-called "revivalists", the ever-emerging generations that seek
 
to identify (at least for a short time) with another culture in
 
and perhaps more fruitful way of looking at the world.
 Some of
 
people are outstandingly successful in absorbing the aesthetics
 
a different
 
these young
 
of another
 
culture; they are, sometimes, actually "better" (more expert, faster, slicker)
 
than the "real thing".
 This puts us in a difficult bind.  When it comes
 
down to the economics of the situation, who should get the money (which is
 
all we have to work with) -- the old man who has lived the life he sings about
 
in his song, or the innocent, golden-throated, young tenor.
 out of a general
 
sense of social justice and a not very specific or provable sense that the
 
life-style controls the aesthetic result, we have opted for the authentic as
 
opposed to the imitative.  Our guidelines, however, remain open on this point;
 
we have not ruled out the revivalists, merely put them further down our list
 
of priorities.
 
7
.  Actual revival projects, cases where there are no known practitioners
 
of the art form, and where we are therefore forced back upon historical
 
reconstructions.
 The Program has made a distinction here between "revitalization
 
and "revival".
 The former represent artistic practices that remain within
 
living human memory but simply haven't been practiced recently; the latter
 
are really and truly dead.
 Folk Arts has supported revitalization projects
 
but has tended to feel that revival activities are better handled by the
 
other programs, especially museums and  media.

CURRENT NEEDS
 
1
.
 Support organizations. The Program chose early on to work with the
 
s
tates through the folk arts coordinator program rather than to wait for the
 
private sector t
o come up with the kind of support organizations that we need.
 
This has been a successful strategy in some ways, but leaves us somewhat stuck
 
within the culturally arbitrary  boundaries of the states themselves.  We are
 
beginning t
o work with the various Regional organizations, but still lack the
 
kind of free-wheeling go-anywhere, do-anything, take-care-of-the-problem-
right-now kind of effort that could be provided by private sector support
 
organizations.
 
Some of these needs, it is true, have been met by our sending out
 
panelists and consultants to provide technical assistance and t
o give us
 
effective evaluations of funded and un-funded projects.  Our service contract
 
with the National Council on the Traditional Arts has been a lire-saver in
 
this regard.  However, getting the right consultant t
o the right place at the
 
right time puts a heavy demand on staff-time and will never work really well
 
without a significant increase in staff.  For example, CPAC has expressed an
 
interest, t
o the point of even volunteering partial funding, in the idea of a
 
Folk Arts team of experts touring all the Pacific Islands to consult with the
 
local arts agencies on how t
o develop their indigenous art f
orms.  Selecting,
 
briefing, and organizing such an effort will be a real burden for the already
 
over-burdened Folk Arts staff, but it must be done.  However, if we had the
 
appropriate support organization, this project could be shifted over, along with
 
the support monies needed t
o see that it is professionally handled.
 
2
.  Training. We are in the ironic position of having more positions open
 
f
or qualified f
olk arts experts than we have sensitive, well-trained, and
 
culturally experienced candidates t
o fill them.
 It is clear that a training
 
effort must be mounted, since the trend to set up more and more of these
 
positions shows no signs of abating.
 Since the major universities so far show
 
no signs of responding to this obvious need, the four federal agencies,
 
with active folk arts and folk life programs, NEA, NEH, Smithsonian, and
 
Library of Congress -- considered from time to time that a federal inter-agency
 
training and/or internship effort might be launched.  The lack of appropriate
 
and necessary staff time has been the major deterrent.
 
3
.  Additional professionally qualified staff. 
(
See above.)
 
IDEAL '
=ER THROUGH T
WHICH THE ARTS ENDOWMENT CAN ASSIST FOLK ARTS
 
1
.  Continued maintenance of the present system of providing one to three
 
times funding for small community-based projects in the folk arts, where these
 
are not being supported by the states.  This is the base of our mountain.
 
2
.  Continuation of the present systems of funding state folk arts
 
coordinators until their positions and programs can be entirely state-
supported -- all fifty-four.  Additional funding f
or local and regional folk
 
arts coordinators, as appropriate.
 
3
.  Continued support for pilot projects for folk artists in AIS,
 
combined with an effort t
o help the states develop intelligent and exciting
 
FATS programs to be funded out of their AIS block grants.  Continued involvement
 
of qualified local folk arts specialists in order to keep the standards high.
 
4
.  Funding for an on-going prime-time major PBS or network series on
 
folk arts and folk artists throughout the c
ountry.
 
5
.
 Support for local radio and video series in the folk arts, to provide
 
community feedback, increase public appreciation, and raise the standards of
 
local traditional arts.
 
6
.  A minimum of twenty-five ethnic t
ours criss-crossing the country.
 
Each t
our should be kept on the road periodically for at least three years
 
(
with a possibility of further application).  After the three near period of
 
visiting local ethnic communities has been completed, each t
our should be
 
evaluated to determine whether or not it should not appear in larger public
 
locales -- universities, civic auditoria, etc. or be presented ov-

The latter activities might or might not be

MINORITY CONCERNS AND SPECIAL CONSTITUENCIES
 
Probably half our grants include older citizens in positions of honor
 
and respect.  We have made several grants in support of folk arts activities
 
in prisons, and intend to continue and improve such support.
 Similarly, we have
 
made many awards to handicapped folk artists.  There are lots of the latter;
 
in traditional communities it has long been the custom for the blind and
 
crippled to become full-time practitioners of the arts.  It started before Homer.
 
If "minority" is expanded somewhat t
o include European ethnics and
 
regional groups, such as Appalachianists, a full half of our grants go 10
 
specifically to minority organizations
 
and the remainder include minority participation -- e
.g. state or city folk
 
festivals.  Folk Arts recommends caution in addressing these issues by federal
 
regulation; a great many of the organizations we support, being themselves
 
minority, would be badly served by culturally ham-handed requirements for
 
participation by other minority groups, and we see that coming down the road.
 
Though we recommend, when asked, general public access to Endowment-funded
 
events, we don't enquire too closely into the conduct of a Navajo ceremonial,
 
and we urge that EEO regulations  not be enforced on every Chicano community
 
festival.
 
PLANNING BY OBJECTIVE
 
Realistically speaking, all Folk Arts activities are in support of the
 
Living Heritage.  Thereby, all the other Basic Policies -- Individual
 
Creativity and Excellence, Institutional Creativity and Excellence, Making
 
Arts Available and Leadership in the Arts -- then become strategies, ways
 
to do what we want t
o do.  That way, madness lies, so we have taken a general
 
stab at another way of organizing it.  Asterisks indicate new efforts.

ADMINISTRATIVE REOUIR
.EMFNTS
 
Folk Arts does its business through endless and complex negotiations
 
rather than through the handling of a large number of applications.  We
 
thus are administratively t
op-heavy and will remain so.  By 1982, we will
 
need to establish an assistant program director slot, add one more arts
 
specialist and one more program specialist (
grants).  By 1
983, we will need
 
one more arts specialist and another clerical worker.  By 1984, we will need
 
one more clerical position.
 
We now have a staff of seven (
assuming that our current arts specialist

Dear Priends of the .
Folk Arts:
 
I 
try and appologize for sending on to you t
ies rag,,
,ed text.
 
It's th e  core of my preliminary t
houghts and the best of v
rhat I
 
read towards the subject of evaluating
; what is being done in thi
 
name of t
r
ee folic arts at i
1"A.
 It will at least '
nave the advantage
 
of Showing you the prccess of r
k y  thoughts and, if yo:
.z're willing,
 
of genuinely incorporating your thoughts into the final version.
 
Yet to come are a summary statement of w
',at alternatives in policy
 
might derive from what I
've said '
mere, as well as a soi:t of
 
practical check sheet of what we should watch for in t
r
.e projects
 
that we have funded.
 Granted that yo ,a should have had the final
 
policy-oriented statements before you can finally say sompthirig
 
about. t
l
^is, I'll at least promise to make them
, brief and to  the
 
point.
 
Beep in mind that this is all very much first draft, needing re-
organization,  editing and summaries.
 Naybe,  though,  just maybe
-,
 
t
'
.e sloppiness of it all will be made up for by the textual
 
energy that went with writing; it in a fury.
 (Fa!)
 
Why Evaluation?
 
Why,  indeed?  Evaluation, like
X
dministration,  is something of an
 
embarassment in matters of culture.  We know too well that the
 
administrator's job is often at odds with the artist's, especially where
 
the administrator is call-3d upon to use standar4; of measurement
 
A08 AS A RE54 4
 
which are not inherent to culture, ^ often missing the *e quality
 
of the thing as seen by the artists and their audiences
 From
 
on the one '
nand
 
th4 19th century forward we've experietegced/the rise of �u t
i�cracy
 
and rationalized planning within the framework of the modern
 
nation state, while on the other a series of artists and artistic
 
movements which consciously resist the planning of culture--Gscar
 
Wilde, art neuveau, symbolism.  surrealism, et al.
 And when one
 
reads in the New York Times (July 23, 1979) that�he Ford Foundation
 
is planning to subsidize a management team to run a cooperative of
 
of New Delhi nstreet performers (Who live under a bridg e once it
 
CA)
 
has "elected a board of directors' the idean seem• daffy.

Still, taking a grand view of things, culture in the long run
 
involves actions which are in some sense adminiat_ative, in  so far
 
as culture has to be assembled,  organized, distributed, and,- .-
y
-&S,
 
evaluated.
 And though this appears to be a ratter that only arose
 
with the rise  o
f the modern indtstrialized state,  it is at least as
 
old as the a debate between l

In any case, there is a long history of administrative intervention
 
CASeS
 
in the folic arts.
 Let me cite only a fey- r
'ontaigne's (again) worries
 
over t
he commercialization of the popular festivalfs (
in 1581),  the
 
committee set up in the late 1700's to ascertain the authenticity of
 
Ossian's oral poetry;  t
he editing and adaptation of folk songs by
 
Fayden, Beethoven, Schubert, Schumann, et al.;  the long
, series of
 
outside organization and intervention into Appalachian folk culture
 
from t
he 1890's on,  the ►
vFA.  . . the escalator goes on and on.

So, I begin sere with a discussion leading towards evaluation within
 
t
re Folk Arts Program.
 Because I am starting from scratch. I assume
 
that it will be necessary to explore some basic features of the
 
Fro�R

 in order to get at what successes or failures are occuring
 
a-
iong grantees.
 In other words, I think that this must be a kind o
-
f
 
two-sided approach, the Program and its grantees being looked at
 
at once.
 This is a first step, designed to provoke discussion.
 
Everything is preliminary and tentative.
 And though I will `ry
 
hard to avoid n
ontifocating, it will be easy to slip into,  for

I could, of course, launch into an ethnomethodological critique of

among a constituency as diverse and diffuse as l

here.
 Instead, let me just say that with the small n's involved
 
hers, talented observers can make better estimates of results,
 
quicker and more economically than could be done by other means.
 
This does not mean that we should ignore numbers, but that they can

concrete about what we
 
might be looking for, for the time being I want to explore some
 
of the things we tell the public we are seeking, supporting, en-
couraging, acknowledging, celebrating, documenting, etc.
 I want
 
to look at these concepts, these terms, and raise discussion about
 
them in order to see where we might begin to make judgements of
 
worth, in and out of the Frogra*te So, what first follows is some
 
discussion of "tradition," '

Culture
 
I take on the vaguest and most troubl�ng term of them all advisedly.
 
It is easy to talk of culture in the abstract, as something one is
 
for or against, but I need to raise the issue of cult,,,re in America,
 
and this is one of the thinest areas �
 systematic work.

are of course the ethnocentric, self-serving, invidious assays
 
which offer up America as a failed poor relative of Europe (Henry

as I
've suggested, there is no total view, no map to the cultural
 
landscape.
 
In order to focus this discussion I'd like to do a strange and
 
possibly indefensable thing: I want to direct my thoughts at (and
 
through) Herbert J. Cans' Fonular Culture and High Cultures An
  
Analysis and Evaluation of Taste (N.Y., 1
974).  This I do for
 
several reasons: Gans has had extrordinary field experience among
 
different peoples of the U.S. and has in addition brought much of
 
i
ris considerable expertise to bear on mass media and cultural
 
apparatus.
 He is a serious 5
C�
 in an area noted for t
;:e lab's of
 
them.
 Also, unlike mast of those who went before him, Gans wants
 
rather consciously- to take a populist perspective `owards America►
 
culture and its sources.
 T
'n
_is then is no effete snot out to pummsl
 
th e masses.
 It  is  aioo  a vGOc:  thought well of  in  many  ci r cl -s.

it deserves a serious response.

-Tlies in 41s exposure of the biases of mass culture
 
critics.  But let me first start by calling attention to the way
 
in which he conceives of the
 -
 -
 culture groups.
 
Cverall, he sees five levels Ad or classes of c
,
-lture and culture
 
audiences in America: high, upper-middle, lower-griddle, low and
 
Cu �

 K

quasi-folk.
 In a footnote (p. 167) he equates these wheasaw with
 
what l
ie sees as their audiences' educational achievements: university,
 
collegiate, high school, 10th grade and grade school.  Fe also
 
equates these groups with social classes and indeed suggests t
l-at
 
social class is the best indicator of an individual's "taste
 
culture."  ;
;ere, I think Gans' simple layering of America into
 
'�educy-f

by contrasting standards of utility, virtuosity, skill and beauty,
 
as well as by different situations of work, all involved in shifting
 
interpenetrations of each other.
 But also see mom `
Rolfe. The
 
Fainted Word, N.Y., 1977•
 The stress in both these works is on the
 
social organization of art production, rather than on the content
 
of art per se.
 Gans is getting at this, but not very clearly.

social, political, and philosophical questions and fundamental

Consider his treatment of "quasi-folk low"
 
culture which he ascribes to "poor people, who work in unskilled blue
 
collar and service jobs;whose education ended in trade school;
 
many of them rural or of r
ttral origin and nonwhite (p. 9
3)."
 
Numerically, at least, I would think that here he had in mind blacks,
 
but blacks appear elsewhere in his S
cheme as m
iembers of a "partial"

if he is
 about them being temporary cultural audiences.  So,
 
(

he is careful to describe immigrants' cultures as "mainly .
folk and
 
quasi-folk low (
p. 102)," "sparse, and dominated by compensatory
 
content to cope with and escape from deprivation (p.101;" (

Again, I should say that vans deserves credit for at least raising
 
So
 
the issue of unqual access to the arts in America, but he does^ in
 
such a way as to obscure some of the vain issues.  For instance,
 
d

while he
 a plurality of audiences (
an terms of a heir 4r
-chy),
 
there are surel? more cultural audiences.than he allows.  Though
 
he hints at male-female differences in audiences at the low level,
 
he does not face the possibility at other levels. fullYe  To take
 
an example, women who have  istoricall  been members of the social

of�art.  But their senskbilities have been important for showing us
 
1
 A
 
that there was a distinctive womens' point of view in various art
 
movements at various periods.
 (But I fear he would dismiss 4�!I's C

I suspect that Gans has in the back of his analysis an awareness that
 
pluralism in the arts of the U
.S. has usually meant pluralism of
 
races, ethnicity, regions, genders, and class identification
, more
 
often than it has  meant differentiation in culture.  Thus. the
 
arts become political tools for validating groap identity.  And
 
it is to this that I think he is @bliquely objecting.  But this  :
ind
 
of manipulation is 
v
 alid use of the arts, and if it has often
 
A 
produced some bad art, it has also produced some good art.

Is
 
ahistorieal focus on tka consumption to the neglect of artistic

 It seems to me that what is being

in America.

I know I have been belaboring the Gans book, but I hope it

be justified as I try to move forward now to what else we nee 4 
to come to terms -with in culture analysis.  Let me rush !I forwal-d
 
a bit.

It's true that we are used to thinking of, say, a lo w class culture

another and as such **usually clair  o
d much for what
 
accomplished, and too little for those they have assayed.
 Instead,
 
I think it might be reasonable to assume that the  culture one learns,
 
that one par
illy inherits and partially creates for oneself, has V---
.cL-
 
been contributed to by many people from many classes, and that some
 
part of what one has in the way of culture is a common culture.
 
And this common culture may be bigger than we have allowed ourselfes
 
t
 Y wadmit.  For example, it is true that there are a number of
 
dialects of English, many of which mark mxmkaxx users as being
 
members of a social or cultural class, but there is also a level of
 
English at which language is shared, and each variety  of English
 
contributes to this level of
 
o
rpmonaiity.  It is certainly the case
 
that w
ivadr linguis 4li� features ^distinguish one class from another are
 
not inherently better or worse than one another, and sadly for
 
people such as Edwin Newman and William Safire, many of the
 
locutions they detest have been with us since Chaucer (as a glance
 
at ti
--
,e Cxford  English Dictionary would tell them), and nave passe::
 
from one social class to anothe r
  
Even the
 
standard language of written English has itsel-

vramscis  hegemony is a concept which goes beyond culture--it includes
 
culture, but aAARm a culture in which t
:
^
iere are also dominant and
 
subordinant forces at work in making,  changing, maintaining and  living
 
culture.
 It thus includes such r
,
-m
atters as inequality and asynetry
 
i
 
in the making and living of culture.
 In brief,  t
l:e hegemonic or the
 
dominant culture is one which is more than the  ideoloEy of the
 
dominant, more than the conscious control mechanisms of the dominant,
 
it goes beyond such ideas as "manipulation," "cooptation," and
 doctri-
�
/
 n
 
nationl
 fixe
s
 
It is a whole body of practices and expectations,  over
 
the whole of living= our senses and assignments of energy,
 
our shaping perceptions of ourselves and our world.
 It is
 
a lived system of meaning and values--constititive and
 
constituting--which as they are experienced as practices
 
appear as reciprocally confirming.
 It thus consti ates a
 
sense of reality for society, a sense of absoluteY because
 
experienced reality beyond which it is very difficult for
 
,'
-most members of the society to move,  in most areas of
 
 
their lives.k
 
f
.i
_  liams, P. I10.
 
The hegemonic,  then, is a culture, but one in which some social forces
 
dominate others in cultural activities.
 In the conception of he ;-emony,
 
and
 
for example,  one does not look for the dominan, Kn armies, governments
 
and bzsinesses�pimwwPr but also in ch�irches,  -fair
ii-lies , sports ;coups,
 
7
 
Ftc., wherever the hegemmnc idea has penetrated.
 
Since the he�emonic is such a pervasive and powerful force, as con-
ceived within this framework,  the problem becomes one of being aule
 
to distinguish between alternative or oppmsitional cultural elements
 
which are 1) made within the hegemonic struct:re, and
 limited,
 
1
,Y4
 
changed
 3 or rejected by it; and those elements which are M
mmpatabi
 
irreduceable to hegemony and are independent developments.
 Here is
 
Williams' conception of cultural relationships (with some modifications
 
by me):
 
a
)  the hegemonic or the dominant cultural elemOn ho
 
b)  the archaic --seen by most people as part of the past, used as if
 
they were of the past, but capable of being revived and used
 
as another form of cultures
 
Q  the r
esidual--cultural elements formed in the past, but still active,
 
M dan
u
 sed in the present,  of the present.
 
cl) active residual elements--largely incorporated into the
 
present dominant culture.
 
c2) alternative/oppositional elem*n*s--i.e., elements alternative
 
or oppositional to those of the dominant present.
 
(Notes  the examples given by Williams for cl and c2 are "religion"
 
and the "rural": that is,  there are elements of religion in contemporary
 
society which have survived from the past, but which are fully incor-
porated into the hegemonic--such as official morality, civil religion,
 
or the other world as ratifying this one; but there is als
, sense of
 
rel l
iion whit; is alternative to the dominant, such as Oa family of
 
man, or service without earthly reward. The rural,  similarly,  is largely
 
incorporated as an 'other', as a fantasy, as a leisure escape,  etc.,
 
but also stands as an at least theoretical alternative to industrial-
ization.)

is is not just a
 
matter of reaching back into the past for ideas, or of the "novel." or
 
�innovatio
 t
e
 ose developments belong within the dominant; rather this is
 
development of cultural elements from radically diverse
 
elements,  something akin to creolization.
 The emergent is thus
 
difficult to predict or to plan for,  though it is a regular feature
 
of cultural life.
 
or t r i e s  t o  take hold
 
when the dominant takes hold/of emergent, residual, and archaic elements
 
it typically uses only part of them, often excluding "tie personf
 a
 
or the private,  the natural,  the metaphysical."
 Here,  it seems to
 
me that Aw Aomments on what many of us find questionable in what we
 
call the "commercialization" of folk arts, or even in some revival
 
efforts.
 nil
lms also notes that in efforts at cooptation,  the original
 
cultural element and its creators may have to fend against the facsimile.
 
and this is a difficult matter,  sincihany will not see the di fIrence,
 
or the differences may seem irrelevant, more costly,  etc.
 And this should

The Traditional
 
Tradlt
.ion for most people means something
, old, something rooted in
 
historic al
 
the past or in conditions of life past.  Many folklorists find it
 
difficult to use the concept uncritically, or at least to use a
 
definiition of folklore too closely identified with ago
-, since it
 
tends to minimize the contemporary functions of folk art, or tj rule
 
out the creation of folk arts .

When tradition is raised we are quite frankly in the midst of
 
discussions which pose questions of the gruality of life in various
 
times and places.  But it is certainly necessary to corfronrit,
 
even in these terms , since theorists of modernity and deviopment
 
(
such as P
lax Weber, Edward Shils or Daniel Beli)have Lpp( �
 
tradition as opposed to economic development and political stability
 
(
I am putting this cr- Aely , but so do development specialists!)
 
Thus they have seen it ncessary to attempt to erode traditional
 
I
 
values in the developing areas of the world.
 (
Cf. Ferbert Gans again,
 
especially his discussion of the way in which popular culture has
 
liberated many people from "traditional values" (p.
 )--which he sees
 
a
 
as^ positive thing.) LThe irony in all of this is that under
 
contemporary political and technological changes our own traditions
 
1
 
have been boldly undermined , think of the consequences of even such
 
simple and straightforward changes as Sunday shopping, TV, the
 
shopping mall and the like . Our own lives thus come to more and
 
more resemble those of the Tq 4
l
 d World in spite of ourselves.
 
One of the outcomes
 
 these pressures is the tendency to t
reat
 
many elements of non-artistic traditional life as somehoq unserious
 
1
  
styles of discourse
 
--such things as child raising practices, mzxxaxsxzfxtxikaxg

Authenticity
 
Authenticity, even more than tradition and culture, is an
 
evaluative term . In d
 eed, it is a kind of moral universal,
 
floating free of the objects it names.  We are

°odernization simultaneously separates these thinks
 
from the people and places that made them, breaks up
 
the solidity of the groups in which they originally
 
figured as cultural elements, and brings the people

or reconstruct a cultural heritage or social identity.

 Tourism and participation in other

 sic  a place
 
for unattached individuals in modern society.
 the act
 
of sightseeing is a kind of Involvement with social

from his disparate experiences.
 Thus, his life and his
 
society can appear to him as an orderly series of formal
 
representations, like snapshots in a family album.

other words, after pulling things from the contexts, breaking
 
the crains of "tradition," and scattering people across the earth,
 
modernity provides tourism as a means of finding or reconstructing
 
a heritage.  What this adds up to is that -- contra Bell , vans, et al.
 
--modernity's triumph is not tkatxk:tkaxAiffaxapasa  "the dissappareance
 
of the nonmodern wcrld, but its artificial preservation and re-
construction in modern society.

nonmodern culture traits from
 
their original contexts and their distribution as .

7accanrell raises authenticity by recalling Daniel Boorstin's
 
thoughts on the matter in his book .he Image: A Guide to Fseud,?!-
�aents in America (N.Y., 1961).  Boorstin made distinctions between
 
real and Dseudo tourist sites, between the traveller and the tourist, 
etc., recalling a time when distinctions were clearer than they
 
are today, what with professiona4image makers, press agents, hype
 
art'sfs, flack people and other hustlers.  MacCannell tries to go
 
b®yond this by situating all of these distinctions within the
 
social structure and defined sociallyspace.  :hou & his arguement is
 
too lengthy and detailed to recount here, in effect he says that
 
the real and the pseudo are both socially constituted axmxts
 
distinctions, and sit in a continuum of reality with aMC

Lodernity presents a shinning surface which usually veils a complex
 
synthesis and resynthesis underneith, a merging of modern and older
 
elements such that community development comes to increasingly
 
depend not on abandoning the old cultures--as the developers would
 
have it--but on incorportating the old into the new in a way which
 
can be sold.  The Amish of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania are a
 
case in point, and MacCannell outlines the fact that an enormous

general point of view of the tourist in the organization of#ha
 
modern towns, museums, displays and drama.  The common goal or :

ethnography and tourism is to determine the point at whicii  forced

T

for Americans," Hazel Scott playing boogie woogie, Carmen Jones,
 
Oklahoma, John Steinbeck, Katherine Dunham's dancers, Disney's
 
fables, the Louis Armstrong of the mid-1930's (as opposec: to the
 
Armstrong of the mid-1920's), and Norman Rockwell.
 From
 
Agee's account I de w out the following characteristics:of pseaco-

false  energy, false sentiment, elipsiS,  incompleteness, self-pity,

The Folk and Folk Arts
 
There appears to be no concept of "folk" possible without a larger
 
unit as a point of references  the units vary froiii "urban" to
 
r
 
t
o
 to sophisticated" and the like.  But "folk" suggests
 
r
�
 '
,
 
a part culture much as does  
peasant suggest a part society, and
 
both words finally point to the historical relationship between
 
two dimensions of the same reality.  Robert Redfield in 1
.is attempt
 
to escape 19th century European monolithic concepts like "nation"
 
and "civilizatio n distinguished between great and little traditions
 
as a way out of the culture problem.  But that distinction implies
 
more and less than the historical record provides.  There were a
 
sometimes
 
number of little traditions and a number of great ones,/even in
 
the same regional and historical context; and in addition, the little
 
tradition was shared by Viose A
v@& practiced the great tradition, at
 
n
 
e
 
least until the 1?00's.
 In any case, there is a rich interpentration
 
A
 
of the two in any-society —for example, the role of several hinds
 
of Catholicism in Italy.
 It seems clear that Redfield--li'ce Conrad
 
10 COAA A L
INI
 
y7j e
S
 
Arensberg and others who studied i
oaaxthe folk
. hroughout the world--
 
r
 
exaggerated the dis:tiaatzmxdistinctiveness of those they studied.
 
Ferhaps t
,l
. best documented case of this is that of 1

ie Jewish sh';eti 
in Eastern Europe.
 Earbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett has shown how
 
Model
 
In her unp �usblished paper, "The Shtetl/in Last Earopean Jewis'
 
Ethnology," '
f
9""
 
this image of self-contained, small, discrete Jewish community was
 
shaped in the  lace of all the cotradictory =
Listorical ev �i
-dence.
 
I think we need to draw attention to the way and which these and all
 
other definitions are constructed:  they are historically and socially
 
situated and depend finally on a need to expres a relationsi;ip of
 
the visual
 
within thei& world.
 Perhaps the popularity of/folk arts
 
in the 20th century provides a parallel case.
 Folk and /Primitive arts
 
grew in popularity (indeed came to be defined) among artists and
 
art audiences alonTside of the rise of modernism in art.
 Harold
 
Rosenberg says that folk
 I can be considered a trendless,  timeless
 
version of modern art, both of which were tied together by having
 
e
 
been rejcted by academicians.

Community
 
A community is a conceptual horizon, said the philosopher '
r
'usse
_rl.
 
Indeed, a
ny a
ttempt to be more specific about communities encounters
 
numerous problems.
 Community studies illustrate that community
 
bo.Andaries are artefacts of the methodolop
zr used and the narrative
 
n
 
form of presentation.
 To be sure, the government and the media
 
•
ase the term without a blink, but close looking suggAsts that 4
900K
 
to
me term in that use is relatively emplty:  what for example does
 
"the black community" mean?  If anything this usage attempts to
 
convert a simple typological statement (such t:
.e "the Jews")  into
 
one w^ich claims for itself some objective reality (
"t:'-
- Jewish
 
community") .
 
Cne of the things handicapping our work in the arts is insufficent
 
concrete information on how Americans are living, of w1
,at vari-ty
 
what the links are between vario:.z5 levels of the nation,
 
of communities there are now./how life in organized witi:in t

All of this comes home to me particularly when I consider that we
 
encounter proposals which proport to serve a specific locale, a

A last thought on something which might be helpful in this area:  t-e
 
relationship between community and culture.
 In trying to see what
 
is or is not cultural,  there is a useful insight in the writings of
 
Edward Sapir, developed further by Dell Hymes.
 Sapir distinguished
 
between the cultural as a snared heritage (consensus) and
 
as t

A Note on Folk Intellectuals

is f
oznding is not works of art, not traditions, not, ir
, s
?^
,ort the
 
ccntent of a certain kind of art or intellectual work:  ' n fact,
 
I would argue that the Endowment as a whole is not f
iAndi.ig these things.)
 
,
[
tatter, it is funding individuals, groups, netweorks and occasionally
 
comm
,anities and larger units of persons.
 This needs special elaboration
 
elsewhere.
 But here I want to say that what is unigote about tris
 
Program is the special nat.1re of the individuals funded and their
 
needs.
 By definition, Folk Arts is not practiced by arts professionals,
 
as that term is usually used.
 But this does not mean that we a-rP not
 
funding intellectuals (and I inc---,
dm artists within that term).  Let
 
T
M
te take a text from Antonio Gramsci:
 
.
 there is no human activity from which every form
 
of intellect:
,al a tixityparticipation can be excluded:
 
?
;omo faber canr t be separated from '
iomo sapiens. 
Each
 
man, finally, outside his professional activ ity, carries
 
on some form of intellectual activity,  that is,  r
P is a
 
'
philosopher', an artist, a man of taste,-he part
'cipates
 
in a particular conception of the world, he bas a con-
scio�is line of moral cond ,i
ct, and therefore contribrtes to sustain
 
a conception of the world or to modify it,  t
'
rat is, to
 
bring into being new modes of tro_ight.
 
A.itonio  Gramsci, selections From t
he Frison Notebooks, N.Y., 19;1, p

.
 
=ere, Gramsci is calling attention to t
he fact that the wore_ of
 
intellectuals lies in what they do, with other people, iii  social

A last thought on Gramscis he distinguished netween traditional
  
intellectuals and organic intellectuals, the difference being that
 
traditional intellectuals serve existing institutions, governments,
 
classes, etc., while organic intellectuals are those "home-grown"
 
figures needed by various groups within society to held give them
 
goals, a sense of being, a direction.  The problem, as it exists, is
 
t
hat the established institutions and classes drain off the l
east
 
intellectuals, leaving other levels unrepresented and ,-
i
 g uide,l.
 
There is a small strain of concern within anthropolo gy and folklore
 
for this type of local intellectual.  Anthropologists' praise of the
 
key informants often
 it, and the Lomax family has more con-
sistently than anyone made g
as aware of such people.  Lately, several
 
reonle have attempted to show that professional country singers

Identity
 
Clearly, much of what folk arts is concerned with caned by called
 
matters of identity.  Questions of identity are apparently always
 
�
\
 e
ve 6 W
 
intense in plural societies, but they a m especially poignant
 
since the 1950's.  The 5
0's, in fact, wer
• a period in which a great
 
deal sot said about identity as a problem, a crisis, but in
 
retrospect that concern was somewhat naive.  It's primary focus
 
was in a narrow range of ego psychology, with its corce ✓ntration
 
of the inividual against the mass.  But identity in America has
 
n
 
enormous social dimensions, involving various permutations of age,
 
race, gender, ethnocoty, religion, occupation, class, location, etc.
 
In the 1960's for example there was a wide-spread discrediting of t
he

"adolescent" is the mode of becoming, discovery, pain and love.
 
These are probably indefensable categories, but useful to make my point:
 
(And, in t
he '
?0's, there appears to be
 
irapi4 disc ^ iting of the
 
adolescent mode!)

views t

he 1950's-60's in terms o
f

of t
he amount of adult modality they represented.  Thus, t
'

 I
 `any case, he says,  the  '60's produced a nation  caught
 
up with a "distanced infatuation with American archetypes and
 
artefacts--we were like "emigres in a new country."
 
Let me talk for a bit about one conception of identity.
 It is
 
possible, I think,  to view it as a forra of performance, as a display,
 
a cultural fore-rounding;
 Identity might
 b e considered also to
 
be more a matter of relationships (of persona,  actions,  of c
i:aracter-
istics)  that it is a matter of content:  it is not so much that a
 
person speaks a certain language that gives '
him such-and-such identity
 
as it is that he is in a specific relationship with others who
 
speak the language and language may or may bot be an important
 
part of that relationship.
 You can imagine a_groap of people
 
p�c .
e
-
1
 
who speak the same language without any P
 
 
social consequences.
 
But if another group's language begins to absorb and replace their
 
own (either by force or by slow abandonment),  the language they speak
 
or spoke becomes relevant ath xixallc--that is,  it becomes culturally
 
foregrounded as important.
 So it is not simply the presence of a
 
c:
iaracteristic that is impo rtant to identity, b
eat also its
 
attenuation or its absence as well.
 
P
 
Bich the same situation can be imagine:? for a number of social
 
--
levels in comblex societies--for sub-cultural :
groups,  ethnic gro�.zps,
 
classes,  races,  whatever.
 Identity, wit'rin degrels,  is al; ,ays to
 
come extent flex ile, ne otiatle, and not socially fixed.
 
tity
 
is a prodact of indi -i
idaal interactions and sccial catei
;orizing, and
 
nothinz ai -hin s
�zcr_ realms is i
r�mutaole.
 
L
l
 
So much is well known, I suppose.  But the tra"ble begins when one
 
atterr 4s to be specific about these issues.  For example, thos
e
 
interested inlie analysis of identity find it useful to disptinguish
 
l
!
 actual
 
between a person's identity (the aocial person one co-l'
, Le pri-.
, i 
to be, without a doubt) and a person's,imputed identity (a social
 
stereotype, either positive of negative in nature).  In thass terms,
 
the first type of identity is more "real" than the otlf
.er.
 3,At the
 
problem arises in that both actual and imputed identities are
 
negotiated realities, not facts determined in advance and for all
 
times an ethnic individual's identity, as an ex
cample, is the resi.ilt
 
of negotiations between himself and his fellow group members and
 
non-members.
 (An actual identity proves impossible to determine,
 
as the real retreats from being fixed in place the closer one comes to
 
it.)  Whatever else it may be, identity, stereo p
typed or not,  is not
 
a stable feature of behavior, but a process occuring across a number
 
of contexts with a variety of persons= and the flexibility of identity
 
is considerable across this range.  Some persons skilled at
 
manipulating identity in a complex society can "pass" as ano '
ier'
 
Toup's member, mask their identity, use a large repetoire of codes,
 
dress in different- styles, spear i n  a different manner, and thereby
 
'
peep their public presentation of self neutral or at least dif:'icult
 
e
 
to decipher or unmask.  '

An example might be useful here.  Recent years have brought a sharp
 
1
- �
 
concern with identity to many younger Native Americans.
 Persons who
 
have seemed to be well on their way to cultural and physical
 
assimilation reverse their direction, at least in part.
 A successful
 
graduate student may suddenly decide to leave the "white world" and
 
to return to his reservation to adopt traditional xzXzstyAle of hair
 
and manner.
 Or persons well established in urban situations amy seep; to
 
renew Indianess in diverse ways, even to learn a traditional language
 
anew.
 In all of this, it is the fact of being Indian t
u
r
,at seems a
 
root cause--whether one participates in dances or not, speaks an Indian

 an
 gU
 u

<
,:
 
or not, or seeks continuity of identity in consciously
 
spiritual and characterological ways, the question of what it means
 
to be Indian is inescapably posed.
 
q

The negotiability of identity cannot be dismissed as it sometimes is
 
as merely an individual phenomenon, for it involves public and
 
intergroup consequences.
 Nor car. it be dismissed merely as a
 
-utter of style, and xatxasxnxxa3Xsimply a cosmetic p
'ieno:nenon,
 
"real"
 
instead of an established, historically derived/idenityt
.) For
 
identity is a social re
*ty which gains its authenticity fro-; its
 
use in specific social contexts, and has no essence that can be
 
specified beyond these contexts.
 
So it is when we speak of a person's ethnic identity or class
 
identity, we are calling attention to some aspect of behavior in
 
some
 
relationship to other personsx inxictkxxxx:itxatijcxxin/specii is
 
situations that may, among other persons,  in other situations. be
 
called some other form of identityJg
qbehavior.  What this adds up
 
single
 
to is that identity emerges not from ax/individual or from a
 
group, but from an individual interactiong  with others, with
 
certain features weing foregrounded within the process.
 The
 
and -

there
 
question is not so much who is what, but when/is what!
 
One last thought on how this affects ethnicity.

work (though I think
 Aless mystified than some).  I might only add
 
that America has reached a stage of development in which the
 
interpenetration of economic and personal life is such that modern
 
packaging and advertisements have produced at least the potential for
 
making individual identity into a conscious product , with all the
 
characteristics of commercial packaging.

A View From Afar
 
Every now and then when the current dilemma of the Arts
 
Endowment leads to incipient mental meltdown,  I try to transport
 
myself back to my hometown in central Missouri  (population 1200)
 
and think about the questions the people I grew up with might
 
raise concerning the past record of arts funding.
 The exercise
 
doesn't always reveal clearer answers but it does often produce
 
more honest questions.
 
The first question that I would get asked back home is:
 "Why
 
should the federal government support artists or the arts?"
 
This is not a malicious query.
 Farmers get asked all the time
 
why they should get paid not to farm through Soil Bank and PIK
 
programs.
 They have to answer that question in their own terms
 
also.
 We just need convincing answers.
 Not unlike the issue of
 
the preservation of the family farm,  a cultural issue rather than
 
an economic one in my opinion, we need to be able to demonstrate
 
why our cultural resources,  in all their diversity,  are important
 
assets to our country's future health and well-being.
 
A second question that might get asked is "Why hasn't
 
government subsidy of art made it less costly to see a play or
 
attend an opera or a symphony concert?"
 From afar lower ticket
 
prices or lower booking fees for artistic productions would seem
 
to be a real benefit to rural and lower income citizens as a
 
%V
 
result of government subsidy.
 This does not appear to be the
 
net result of our public support.
 I must admit that I don't
 
really have a satisfactory answer for this.
 It seems that
 
artists and artistic presenters have received very real economic
 
benefit from our funding but in a way audiences have not.
 
Maybe this is an issue the Endowment of the future should address.
 
A third question I might get asked would be:
 "Why aren't we
 
part of the picture culturally?"
 It is not the inclusion of
 
seemingly obscure or avant garde artistic styles in the funding
 
regime which often troubles the viewer from afar, rather it is
 
the apparent exclusion of local or regional cultural traditions
 
in the aesthetic landscape.
 I should add here that this
 
remoteness is often not assuaged by state and local arts councils
 
who often are even more insistent on a very narrow representation
 
of artistic traditions.
 
I don't exactly have an answer for this question but:from a
 
folk arts perspective I do try to explain our general philosophy
 
of building discovery  (
fieldwork)  into our projects.
 Also a
 
general ethic of cultural equity and the acceptance of multiple
 
aesthetic constellations is at least a partial response to this
 
concern.
 Perhaps the Endowment of the future can futher explore
 
ways to realize these goals through  its various programs.
