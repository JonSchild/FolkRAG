TRY AND BE HOME." 
Music by J. P. 
SKELLY. 
Words by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
Copyright, 1885, by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
THERE is a 
charming little girl that lives down in our street, 
She dresses in a 
manner unassuming, and so neat; 
Of beaux she has a 
score or more, who always take delight • 
In walking with her when the moon is shining clear and bright. 
Her father goes to the theatre, and when he hears a 
tune 
That strikes his fancy greatly, why, he learns it very soon ; 
He applies it to his daughter, and when'er she does go out, 
This is the latest song that you will always hear him shout: 
" 
Try and be home when the clock strikes nine, 
Don't be out late in the bright moonshine ; 
For girls will be girls, and men will be men, 
And there's no use talking nonsense till the clock strikes 
ten." 
She goes to all the parties that are given on the block, 
And while she does enjoy herself, her eyes are on the clock ; 
She joins in all the games that are both funny and sublime, 
And altho' interested, still she nc'er forgets the time; 
Her manners are so charming, and she's such a 
winning way 
Whene'er she wishes to retire, why, this is what she'll say : 
"My ma says if I 
stay out late, I'll grow both lean and tall, 
So now pray do excuse me, for I 
hear my father call "— 
Try and be home, etc, 
She's going to wed a 
farmer lad, a 
handsome one, they say, 
That in the country she first met, upon a 
summer day ; 
Some say she never will be content to be a 
farmer's wife, 
And live out in the country, far away from city life ; 
I 
fancy I 
can see her wed and happy as can be, 
And in the room she's seated, with a 
baby on her kee; 
'Tis evening, and the shadows dark around the household creep, 
And with this song she's lulling her sweet baby to its sleep: 
Try and be home, etc.

SINGING TO 
FIRE. 
Music by J. P. SKELLY. 
Words by Gus WILLuxs. 
Copyright, 1885, by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
M IEN nights are growing late, it's nice before the grate 
To watch the charming pictures come and go; 
To hear the kettle sing like birds in early sprihg, 
'rho' earth is covered o'er with winter's snow; 
What faces there we see that smile so lovingly. 
Oh 
I 
could linger there, mid never tire, 
Tho' lonely is the night, ' tis joy and sweet delight 
To pass the hours by singing to the tire. 
Singing to the fire. I 
think of long ago, 
Singing to the fire, the shadows come and go, 
Singing to the fire, sweet mem'ries then I 
know. 
Oh ! happy are the moments when I'm singing to the 
The friends we knew of old, when days brought joys un-
told, 
Return to bless our hearts once more; 
A mother, kind and dear, in vision comes to cheer, 
Tho' here on earth her journey now is o'er ; 
The scenes of youth arise to brighter make our skies, 
And show in dreams of joy what we desire. 
The winds may blow without, and down the chimney 
shout, 
But naught disturbs us, siwring to the fire. 
- Singing to the fire, etc. 
The winter days will come, but bright will be the home 
Where sweetly glows the pleasant hearth so dear; 
Oh ! limy it never fade; hut scatter every shade, 
An 
ii to all weary hearts bring joy and cheer. 
What mem'ries it will bring, about our lives to cling, 
When front all busy scenes we must retire. 
There's nothing half so dear, the lonely heart to cheer, 
As thoughts that come while singing to the fire. 
Singing to the fire, etc.

A LOCK OF HAIR-
Written by Gus Wimums. 
IN 
the soft and falling twilight of a 
weary, weary day, 
I 
was in a 
garret, searching an old bureau, stored away; 
It for years had been there hidden safe away from frost and 
dew, 
And my curious nature tempted me to search it through and 
through. 
Faded pink and yellow ribbons, laces, half a 
century old, 
And 1 
came across a 
packag'e, bound up with a 
thread of gold. 
Something told me to untie it, which I 
did both then -and 
there, 
And unfolded to my vision lay a 
simple lock of hair. 
Oh 
what meniries crowded o'er me as I 
gazed upon that 
curl— 
how it brouolit to me remembrance of a 
young and lov(ly 4.ie; 
One who was my pride and pleasure-- one, who tho' dead and 
gone, 
Changed my life from joy and gladness to a 
being old and worn. 
Flowly I 
rebound the package, and the tears came down lh 
rain, 
As I 
tenderly replaced it where for ages it had lain ; 
Strange how such things do affect us, make our spirits 
droop, 
But how mad that hair would make us— if we found it in 6.-
,r 
soup,

SHE'S THE IMAGE OF HER MOTHER: 
Music by J. 
P. SKELLY. 
Words by Gus WILLums. 
• Copyright, 1885, by Gus W IT.T3 A 
MS. 
Mr daughter is a 
charming girl, and very dear to me, 
In all domestic duties she's as good as she can be. 
She's full of kind attention, and my comfort is her care, 
I 
could not do without her, for her like's not anywhere ; 
She brings me out my slippers, and she brushes off my clothp,i. 
She darns my damaged stockings, and my buttons on she sews, 
And if I'm in the humor, music sweet for me she plays— 
She's the image of her mother in a 
thousand different ways. 
She's a 
pretty girl and a 
witty girl, she's as sweet as she can 
be, 
Iii some of her accomplishments she much resembles me; 
She is musical and poetical, she brings ine happy days— 
She's the image of her mother in a 
thousand different ways. 
She scolds me when I 
come home nights a-feeling rather queer, 
When I've left my companions in a 
place where they sell beer. 
'Tis then she reads the riot act, till I 
the promise give, 
That I 
will never drink again as long as I 
shall live. 
She keeps away from skating rinks, and, 
never bangs, her hair, 
But in ordering new bonnets there's none with her can com-
pare; 
And when she wants a 
new silk dress, she taffies me with 
praise— 
She's the image of her mother in a 
thousand different ways. 
She's a 
pretty girl, etc. 
She has a 
nice young man who much attention to her shows, 
And when she's in his company her face with pleasure glows ; 
She keeps it very quiet, but the truth she need not hide, 
For very soon I 
know she'll be a 
blushing little bride. 
She likes to go out shopping, just to pass an hour or two, 
In worrying the nice young men that show the fashions new; 
Sometimes into my pocket-book she slyly takes a 
gaze— 
ihe's the image of her mother in a 
thousand different ways. 
She's a 
pretty girl, etc. 
JUST PLAIN JIM. 
Music by J. P. SKELLY. 
Words-by Gus WILLIS. 
Copyright, 1885, by Gus WILLIAMS. 
THERE is a 
nice young man I 
know, a 
fire laddie too, 
He is foreman of a 
company, be is handsome, brave and true ; 
Of friends he has a 
score or more, to keep them is his aim; 
So without further preface I 
will now tell you his name: 
Some call him " James." some call him " Jimmy," 
Others will say " Mister" when they speak to him ; 
Pa calls him " Jeems," Ma calls him " Jamesie 
But all the time to me he's only " Just plain Jim." 
Last winter to a 
ball we went, the finest in the town, 
I 
kept him dancing all the time, which made the ladies frown ; 
He was admired by ev'ry one, and the reporters came 
And asked Inc if I'd kindly give to them my sweetheart's name. 
Some call him " Jim," etc. 
Last night he said to me the sweetest, clearest words in life, 
And very soon I 
am to be his happy little wife; 
And when the parson asks his name, if nervous he should be, 
I 
know what I 
shall tell him if he should refer to me. 
Some call you " James," some call you " Jimmy," 
Others Vill say " Mister " as they look so prim ; 
Pa calls you " Jeems," Ma calls you " Jamesie "— 
But all the time to me you're only " Just plain Jim." 
ENGLAND AND HOME. 
M usic by J.

Words by Gus W ILLIAME. 
Copyright, 1885, by Gus W ILLIAms. 
ALL over the world I 
have wandered, 
All over the world I 
have been, 
I've mixed with the wealth of all nations, 
And all of their pleasures I've seen ; 
But 'midst all the glare and the glitter 
That met me on every hand, 
There's naught could compare with thee, England, 
Old England, my own native land. 
In the " land of the free" I 
am living, 
In the ' land of the free" now I 
roam, 
But my heart ever turns to thee, England, 
Dear England and " Home, sweet, home." 
I 
ne'er knew I 
loved thee so dearly 
Until I 
had roamed far away ; 
Sweet mem'ries of love and devotion 
Still dwell in my heart, night and day ; 
Tho' smiles may be bright all around me, 
• 
And greet me wherever I 
roam, 
Still brighter to me seems the sunshine 
Of England, Old England, my home. 
In the " land of the free," etc. 
Whatever my lot in the future, 
Whatever my station may be, 
My heart still will cling to thee, England, 
I'll always prove loyal to thee; 
And if cruel fate should determine 
That here I 
should die, as I 
roam, 
Let my body be brought to thee, England, 
To rest near the shade of my home. 
In the " land of the free," etc.

WHAT CAN I 
TELL HER ? 
ramie by J. 
P. 
SKELLY. 
Words by Gus Virmaars. 
Copyright, 1885, by Gus WILLIAms. 
I'vE a 
wife who is a 
darling, she weighs twice as much as me, 
And altho' I 
hate to say it, She is strong as she can be ; 
When I 
come home in the morning, and her heart is in despair, 
Of course like ev'ry proper man I 
try to makes things square. 
If I 
call her " duckey darling " she will say it is a " chestnut," 
If I 
tell her she's an angel, she will say that I'm a 
bore ; 
If I 
call her " popsey-wopsey 
she will hit me with a 
mallet; 
So now what can I 
tell her that she has not heard before? 
I 
have tried the old lodge racket, but it never would avail, 
With a 
sick friend I've been sitting up, but that dodge too is 
stale; 
I 
tell her tales in honeyed words, but she will ne'er believe, 
No matter how I 
state my case, she thinks that I 
deceive. 
If I 
say the boat delayed me, she will want to see the captain, 
To ask him if I 
have told the truth, or if I 
was on shore; 
If I 
say the carriage smashed up, she will say I 
should be 
walking; 
So now what can I 
tell her that she has not heard before? 
If I 
send her to the country, in summer bright and gay, 
She will say that I 
ani flirting while she lingers far away; 
Should she want a 
sealskin jacket, and the same should not 
appear, 
She'll say the money I 
have spent on vulgar lager beer. 
If I 
bring her home some oysters, she will surely ask for 
chicken: 
If I 
say " come kiss me, baby," she will faint upon the floor; 
If I 
say I 
lost my night- key, she will say I 
have been drinking; 
So now what can I 
tell her that she has not heard before.

OH I 
WHAT A NIGHT I 
Music by J. P. SlIELLY. 
Words by Gus Maw.= 
Copyright, 1885, by Gus WILLIAms. 
OIIR troubles are over, our cares are at an end, 
henceforth to live in clover, joyously we all intend; 
Oh, what a 
night of worry together we have passed, 
But everything is settled now, and we've got peace at last 
We've wandered here and there, in mystified despair, 
And topsy turvy everything has been ; 
"Oh I 
what a 
night " we've had—to end it we are glad, • 
For such an awful night was never seen._ 
" 
Oh ! what a 
night" of trouble and vexations— 
" 
Oh I 
what a 
night "— its like you can't recall ; 
"Oh ! what a 
night" of funny situations— 
Think of it, just think of it, oh I 
what a 
night" for all.t 
Of pleasures we are weary, of laughter we are tired, 
But hours are never dreary when we know that we're ad-
mired ; 
But now that all is over, let every heart be gay ; 
If you regret the parting hour, we'll meet again some day. 
Now laughter is no crime, we've had a 
happy time— 
Oh! may our life as gay forever seem. 
"Oh ! what a 
night " for us, and what an awful fuss— 
It seems like waking from a 
funny dream. 
" 
Oh ! what a 
ni;ht" of trouble and vexations— 
" 
Oh ! what a 
night "— its like you can't recall ; 
" 
Oh ! what a

Think of it, just think of it, " oh ! what night" for al). •

PRETTY LITTLE DARK BLUE EYES. 
Written and Sung by Gus WI LLiams. • Arranged by J. P. 
SKELLY. 
There is a 
girl, a 
little pearl, - 
And of her to you I'll sing; 
So fair and bright, she brings delight, 
To her fondly I 
will cling: 
Her heart I 
know, is pure as smow, 
And she never frowns or sighs, 
Her voice so clear, I 
love to hear, 
And she has such pretty dark blue eyes.

She's the only girl I 
love, 
She's the only one I 
prize, 
She's the darling of my heart, 
My pretty little dark blue eyes. 
At night, and day, she's ever gay, 
And her laughter ringing clear, 
Makes care depart, and glad the heart,— 
There is sunshine when she's near: 
In happy dreams, to me she seems, 
Like an angel from the skies, 
While o'er me shine like stars divine, 
Those bewitching little dark blue eyes.

love, etc. 
When far away, from her I 
stray, 
Still her image dwells with me, 
In every place, her rosy face, 
Fair and smiling I 
can see; 
She welcomes me, with voice of glee, 
To my arms she fondly flies, 
Though dark the night, like beacon light, 
I 
can see her pretty dark blue eyes.

captain of" the Finest," 
And they are a 
force so grand, 
I 
have risen from Patrolman, 
Now a 
Precinct I 
command; 
When my men are clustered 'round me, 
Proudly I 
the sight behold, 
With good cheer they all obey me, 
Ev'ry one so brave and bold. 
CHORUS. 
Captain Mishler, ev'rybody knows me, 
All around, my praises never cease, 
Bright and gay's the uniform I'm wearing, 
Now I 
am a 
captain of the Finest Police. 
When we lead a 
grand procession, 
I 
am foremost in the line, 
People clear the way before me, 
When my club it makes a 
sign; 
All the ladies smile so sweetly, 
And their handkerchiefs will shake, 
But when plainly dressed off duty, 
They'll no notice of me take. 
Captain Mishler, &c. 
All saloons are closed on Sunday 
In the ward where I 
belong, 
You must pass in through the hallway, 
If you seek for something strong; 
I 
can point out all the drug stores 
Where good liquor can be got; 
And if drunk, and brought before me, 
discharge you on the spot. 
Captain Mishler, &c.

WHEN I'M , ON DUTY. 
Written and sung by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
Music by J. P. SKELLY. 
A member of police am I, dressed in a 
suit of blue, 
I 
wear a 
shield, a 
club I 
wield, to duty I 
am true; 
No fear of danger troubles me, no matter where I 
go. 
And every lady that I 
meet, would like me for a 
beau. 
Cuonus. 
When I'm on duty I 
proudly walk along, 
With an eye for beauty, and an arm that's ever strong, 
To New York's " Finest," remember I 
belong, 
When I'm on duty you should see me. 
At every hour of day or night, I'm always to be found, 
I 
try the doors and watch the stores, as I 
the street go 
'round; 
If on my beat there is a 
row, I 
gently stroll away, 
And when it's over I 
turn up, to hear what people say. 
Cno.—When I'm on duty, etc. 
• 
I 
keep an eye on area ways, the handsome cooks to see. 
Each summer night, they take delight, in making love to 
me ; 
Although I 
am a 
married man, a 
chat can do no harm, 
Policemen are such gallant men, the ladies all they charm. 
Cuo.—When I'm ock day, etc.

KNOCK AT THE WINDOW TO-NIGHT. 
SONG AND CHORUS. 
Arranged by J. P. SKELLY. 
Written and sung by Gus wfwAms. 
I'm courting a 
farmer's fair daughter, 
And often we meet on the sly, 
Her father would scold if he caught her, 
At any one winking her eye, 
But still every evening she meets me, 
And out in the wood- lands we stray; 
When passing her cottage she greets me 
With smiles, and I 
thus hear her say: 
cum:us. 
Knock at the window to-night, love, 
Tap it so softly and light, love; 
Knock at the window to-night, love, 
And there I'll be waiting for you. 
Beside the old porch then I 
linger, 
And soon a 
soft hand is in mine; 
A ring now she wears on her finger, 
To show that our hearts we entwine; 
We roam by the mill and the meadow, 
The stars gently peeping above; 
Each night in the soft twilight shadow, 
I 
think of the words of my love. 
Cuo.—Knock at the window, etc. 
I 
know that she still loves me dearly, 
I 
know that to me she'll be true; 
Her bright eyes are shining so clearly, 
They seem like the sky's azure blue. 
All day of her message I'm thinking, 
And longing the night to appear; 
While watching the golden sun sinking, 
Her soft gentle whisper I 
hear. 
Cno.—Knock at the window, etc.

THE SIGNAL OF SORROW. 
BY GEORGE RUSSELL JACKSON. 
Fast to the front door knob it hung, 
A snow-white silken bow, 
And fitful wintry breezes swung 
Its streamers to and fro. 
The letter- carrier on his round 
The fluttering sign descried; 
His heart recalled a 
little mound; 
He turned away and sighed. 
The signal caught a 
woman's eye; 
Into her face there crept 
A look of grief; as she went by 
She bowed her head and wept. 
The gleeful children, on their way 
To school, the ribbon saw; 
At once they hushed their noisy play 
And gazed around in awe. 
" 
Step softly, please, and shout no more," 
A 
little maiden said; 
" 
Step light on going past the door, 
The little baby's dead." 
The peddler, shouting loud his ware, 
In tones discordant, shrill, 
Observed the fluttering ribbon there, 
And suddenly grew still. 
A tender looked passed o'er his face, 
A tear shone in his eye, 
Ile checked his horse's noisy pace, 
And silently went by. 
SIGNAL OF SORROW—Concluded. 
A man of books, sedate and wise, 
Passed on to take the train; 
The silken signal met his eyes, 
He stopped in sudden pain. 
The meaning of the sign he read, 
That in the breeze did play; 
God keep my little one," he said, 
And, sighing, went his way. 
A wealthy banker passed the spot, 
Its tale the ribbon told, 
And for a 
moment he forgot 
To think of stocks and gold. 
His heart recalled a 
baby face, 
By kisses oft caressed, 
A 
tiny form in creamy lace, 
Laid long ago to rest, 
Thus men their brotherhood reveal, 
The common heart witnin, 
When they that touch of nature feel 
" 
That makes the whole woriti kin."

WHEN LENA PLAYS ON THE GUITAR. 
Words by GUS W ILLIAMS. 
Music by J. 1'. SKELLY. 
Published by POND & CO., 25 "
Union Square, N. Y. 
I'm fond of sweet music and often I 
go, 
At night when its lonely and still, 
To hear my sweet Lena who sings soft and low, 
In the cottage just under the hill; 
She sits in the parlor and watches for me, 
The light in her window's my star; 
I 
soon sit beside her and happy are we, 
When Lena plays on the guitar. 
CHORUS.— She sings and she plays, 
While fondly I 
gaze, 
Upon her my own guiding star. 
There's joy in the air, 
For nothing we mire, 
When Lena plays on the guitar. 
The old folks are sleeping, the dogs are at rest, 
So I 
can do just as I 
please; 
With such a 
companion, of course I 
am blest, 
I 
listen and feel at my ease; 
But Lena is anxious at each little sound, 
She fears for her angry papa; 
I'm not in his graces, he knows I'm around, 
When Lena plays on the guitar. 
Cito.—She sings and she plays, etc. 
I'll go there some evening and knock at the door, 
And sweet Lena I'll serenade, 
And then we will fly to return nevermore, 
With me she will ne'er be afraid; 
And when she is mine, she'll charm me each night, 
While warbling her sweet tra-la-la; 
At home by her side I 
will stay with delight, 
When Lena plays on the guitar. 
Cuo.—She sings and she plays, etc.

— YALLT2R DORG'S LOVE FOR A NIGGER. 
THAR is a 
lone mound in you graveyard cold, 
That, iillOWS no decoration day ; 
For him that's laid away thar to mould, 
is only a 
nigger, they say. 
He died an old vagrant, not a 
cent did he own, 
A 
ml he left not a 
soul to be sad ; 
They gave hint his freedom, he wandered alone, 
And an old yaller dorg was all that he had. 
They dug him a 
grave, and laid him away, 
The poor old worn-out slave ;" 
No prayer for his rest did any one say, 
But his dorg lay down on his grave. 
And there you may see him day after day, 
At morning, at night. and at noon; 
And there's no inducement can get him away 
Front that sad rude grave of the coon. 
Ho lays thin., and moans the whole of the day, 
For no one else does he care; 
And no food can tempt, hint one moment away 
Front the grave of the nigger laid than 
That's a 
mighty fine monument standing rie-lit nigh, 
But to me that poor mound lookshkrger; 
For times a 
monument money can't buy--
A 
yaller dorg's love for a 
nie.ger.

Oh, yes, I 
am one of the finest, 
The finest Police ever known; 
In uniform brilliantly shining, 
As proud as a 
king on his throne; 
The ladies all call me their darling, 
As I 
escort them safe o'er Broadway: 
While strolling my beat through the gay, busy street, 
The people admiringly say— 
CHORUS. 
He's one of the finest, one of the finest, 
Girding our safety and peace; 
Brave and courageous, never outrageous, 
One of the finest Police. 
The flies never plague me in summer, 
Because they are too much afraid, 
I 
use my club like abase drummer, 
That leads a 
big torchlight parade; 
My fam'ly is very domestic, 
I'm sure that they never go out, 
When I 
come to eat, after roaming my beat: 
My.lvifo she is sure for to shout— 
He's one of the rhlest, eta. 
When call'd on I'm always found ready, 
I'm in for protection and peace, 
Though some, I'll admit, are not steady, 
But I'm not that kind of Police ; 
I 
flirt with the girls when off duty, 
Gallivanting with them I 
don't. shun, 
Se gentle I 
am, as a 
little pet lamb, 
And this is the title I've won-

Oh, my, you should have seen her,

And whisper words so sweet, 
It was so nice and so quiet, 
We'd hear our two hearts beat;

My new dress coat he tore, 
In pulling me from where I 
hid— 
Behind the parlor door. 
Behind the Parlor, etc. 
But still we met quite often, 
'Twas business we both meant.

was talking to. 
Walking along the streets in summer time, no matter bow 
dark it was, she could find out more Ice Cream signs, and 
point them out to a 
fellow, than any other girl I 
ever saw. 
I 
never saw a 
girl so fond of Frozen Pudding, and then 
she'd ask me if Soda Water was dangerous, and if oysters

My sweetheart's a 
shy little fairy, 
Her age it is just seventeen, 
Her parents think that she's too airy. 
But a 
sweeter girl never was seen. 
At night she steals out from the cottage, 
Her mother cries after her " Kate," 
She answers, " Dear Ma, I'm not going far, 
I'm just going down to the gate I 
CHORUS. 
I'm just going down to the gate, dear Ma, 
Just down to the old garden gate. 
The moon is so bright, and its such a 
nice night, 
I'll just go as far as the gate. 
Of course at the gate I 
am waiting, 
And sweet are the words that we say, 
While inside the old folks are debating, 
As to whether they'll move first of May. 
Sometimes they call gently for Katie: 
She answers, " Dear Ma, 'tis not late, - 
There's no sign of a 
storm, and the night is so warm; 
I 
love to stand here by the gate! 
I'm just going down, etc. 
They say she's too young to be married,— 
But with them we do not agree; 
Love's message to Katie I 
carried, 
And a 
kiss was the answer for me. 
We'll wander alone in the moonlight,— 
Much longer I'm sure we can't wait— 
Some night, by and by, to the preacher we'll fly, 
When. Katie comes down to the gate! 
I 
am just going down., & e.

I 
KNOW a 
lovely girl, her name is Katie Lee, 
She's charming as can be, she's all the world to me; 
But now we are apart, to see her I'm denied, 
While all the day I 
sigh to clasp her to my side ; 
Each night we used ,o 
meet, down by the garden gate, 
And happy then the hours would fly away; 
But now when 'round the house I 
fondly watch and wait, 
I 
sadly hear my little Katie say, 
Mother keeps the gate locked now, 
To see you love I 
don't know how, 
I 
must stay in the.house, as quiet as a 
mouse, 
For mother keeps the gate locked now. 
We used to meet each night, it was a 
happy spell. 
The moon was shining bright, while tales of love I'd tell, 
But Katie oft would sigh, " Oh what will mother say, 
She thinks I'm at the gate, and I'm so far away ; " 
One night when we returned from a 'delightful stroll, 
Her mother's rage I 
could not pacify : 
I 
quickly went away, but Katie wrote to say, 
That she would come and meet me on the sly, 
For— Mother keeps the gate, etc. 
Now Katie stays at home, and I'm in distress, 
I 
wander all alone, without my happiness, 
I 
try the gate to climb, but there's a 
dog within 
That growls at me and barks, and makes an awful din; 
Poor Katie mopes all day, oh, cruel parents they, 
To treat my little girl so shamefully. 
We'll run away some night, and get married ere daydightl.

I 
loved a 
lady nice and sweet, 
I 
thought her quite a 
queen, 
'Twas happiness her glance to meet, 
Her name was Josephine; 
'We roamed the fields on summer days, 
And when the evening came, 
We used to sit together 
For a 
quiet little game. 
Spoken.—We used to play cards, " Mnggins," " Old Maid," 
and other harmless domestic games, then Josephine would 
ask me to tell fortunes. I 
used to spread the cards out on 
the table, ask her to choose a 
card for herself, and chen com-
mence to tell her fortune in this way— 
CHORUS. 
This is what you don't expect, 
And this is what you do, 
This is what will surely fail, 
And this what will come true. 
This is what you fondly wish; 
A 
kiss then I 
would claim; 
And that's the way we finished up 
Our quiet little game. 
I 
knew her father hated me, 
But still I 
did not care; 
I 
boldly asked his daughter's hand, 
One night when I 
was there; 
The language that I 
used that time, 
I 
think deserves a 
fame; 
8ut he just put a 
damper on 
Our quiet little game.

A QUIET LITTLE G-AME.—Concluded. 
Spoken.—He asked me out in the hallway, and he said, 
"Young man, how much money have you got to support my 
daughter as your wife ?" I 
said, " How much are you going 
to give me ?" He said, " Give you?" 
Well, he hauled off, 
and hit me four or five times, and every timo he struck me 
he said— 
This is what yon don't expect, 
And this is what you do, 
This is what will never fail, 
And this what will come true. 
This is what you fondly wish, 
Ms anger did inflame; 
And I 
was badly beaten 
In that quiet little game. 
But still I 
loved my Josephine, 
And when my wounds were healed, 
I 
managed for to write to her, 
And all my plans revealed; 
One evening, when 'twas dark and still, 
'Round to her house I 
came, 
We run off and got married 
For a 
quiet little game. 
Spoken.—And after we were made man and. wife, I 
wrote 
her father a 
note something like this: Dear Sir, you gave 
me a 
terrible beating sometime ago: this is to inform you 
that I 
am all right now, and last night I 
married your 
daughter and her jewelry; will send you some wedding cake 
when we get one, and— 
This is what you don't expect, 
And this is what you do, 
This is what will surely fail, 
And this what will come true. 
This is what you fondly wish, 
A 
kiss then I 
would claim; 
And that's the way we finished 
Our quiet little game.

While out rusticating last summer I 
met 
A sweet little charmer so dear. 
The smile that she gave me I "'e'er can forget, 
It made me feel awfully queer. 
We walked, and we talked, just as all lovers do, 
IIer name she confided to me. 
As it was too long to put down in a 
song, 
Why I 
call her my sweet Chickadee. 
etiorxs. 
Chickadee. chickadee, 
Sweet little charmer chickadee, 
Chickadee child of the farmer, 
Chickadee, chickadee. 
I 
would not harm her, 
Fer there's none in all the world 
Like chickadee to me. 
I'd meet her each day at the hack kitchen door, 
While her father was out on the farm. 
I 
loved her so much I 
could love her no more, 
To me she'd a 
wonderful charm. - 
I 
went to the garden one still summer's night, 
In hopes there my darling to see, 
When her father's big dog and I 
had a 
fight, 
On account of my sweet chickadee. 
Chickadee, chickadee, etc. 
At last we were married, and now she's all mine, 
And I 
love her more day by day. 
A 
happier couple you never can find, 
So lively, so jolly, so gay. 
We'll grow old together, we'll never he sad, 
And all through the future she'll be, 
The sweet little treasure that makes me so glad, 
My beautiful, sweet chickadee. 
Chickadee, chickadee.

Some married men enjoy themselves, 
By being away from home, 
And some with their dogs all through the day 
They through the woods will roam. 
Some for their pets have little birds, 
But for one thing I 
sigh, 
For music sweet, and joy complete, 
Give me the babies cry! 
Sweet little babies, dear little babies, 
Squaling and brawling all through the day: 
Rosy-faced babies, troublesome babies; 
With the dear babies I 
love to play. 
To hear the babies screaming loud, 
Is music to my ear, 
I 
take them in my arms and say: 
"Oh, Tooksie, Nooksie, dear!" 
I 
dance them gaily on my knee, 
And make them laugh with joy, 
While they rub taffy over me, 
And my necktie destroy. 
Sweet little babies, etc.

SWEET LITTLE BABIES.—Concluded. 
Where'er I 
go, it is the ,same, 
The babies I 
adore, 
I 
love to hear their noisy cries, 
While sprawling on the floor; 
Then I 
go walking in the Park, 
I 
take one on each arm, 
And though some folks may laugh at me— 
I 
think it's quite a 
charm. 
Spoken.—If there is anything I 
do like it's babies, with 
their heads like billiard balls, and they are always trying to 
swallow their fists; I 
remember our first baby, he wasn't 
much larger than a 
minute, and hadn't any more teeth than 
the sign " BEFORE" in a 
dentist's window; he hadn't been 
in the house three days, before he owned more of the house 
than I 
did; he had fat rosy- cheeks, and his face looked so 
much like a 
raw ham that you'd have to guess where his 
eyes were, and when he'd cry, he'd turn as red as sun-down; 
and he could cry loud too, 'twas impossible to get any sleep 
when he was crying. I 
could sleep better in a 
boiler factory 
when they are doing overwork; I 
wouldn't care for the cry-
ing so much if the baby would only change the key once in 
a 
while, a 
baby crying for four hours in A MINOR gets mon-
otonous. 
Then it had Croup, Measles, & c., & c. Oh, a 
baby 
is a 
fine thing to keep a 
man broke,—but still they are a 
great comfort if they don't come too thick; now there's our 
last addition—twins, theyneyer eause us any trouble, if they 
do I 
always sing— 
Sweet little babies, dear little babies, 
Squaling and brawling all through the day; 
Rosy-faced babies, troublesome babies; 
With the dear babies I 
love to play.

I 
vILL now make a

am no 
drinking man, never having drank a 
drop of liquor in my life— 
dot I

I 
am no orator, but shall try ta represend dot 
gread demperance orator, John B. Gough, a 
man whom I've 
ofden been daken for. 
Should I

Deliverance is an old mid veil vorn subject, but like a 
Keno

Id's very hard to approach a

vasn't drinking ?"— 
" 
You mind your business, mid I'll mind yours."—" Come und 
take a 
ball." 
Und oder veil- known expressions used by poli-

I 
vas called upon vonce to see vone of de hardest cases of 
demperance it has ever been my good fortune to vitness. 
A

He said—" Yes, sir; have a

I 
declined to sit, for various reasons. 
I 
spoke to him aboud

At last I 
said, " You have a

g • Yes, sir, de fifth one ; red-headed." I 
said, " You love your

Just den a

und beer)—" Luke Gerloot!"—de man said—" Come in mit 
me, Mr.Whooping-cough." I 
vent in dere, und his vife vos lay-
ing on a

a 
kiss on her forehead in large type. 
She took his foot in her 
hand, looked up, und said—" Oh ! Luke is such a

de first time 
I

De man said—" She says I'm

showed me a

I 
said, " Vere you vaccinated

But she could dance like a

I 
don't speak to her now, because she vanted me to take her 
to a

I

if done so, for 
She vos so stoud, etc.

MEDITATIONS OF A HINDU, PRINCE AND 
SKEPTIC. 
A. C. LYALL. 
All the world over, I 
wander, in lands that I 
never have trod, 
Are the people eternally seeking for the signs and steps of a 
God? 
Westward across the ocean, and northward ayont the snow, 
Do they all stand gazing, as ever, and what do the wisest know ? 
Here, in this mystical India, the deities hover and swarm 
Like the wild bees heard in the tree tops, or the gusts of a 
gathering storm ; 
In the air men hear their voices, their feet on the rocks alo 
seen, 
Yet we all say, " Whence is the message, and what may the 
wonders mean ? " 
A 
million shrines stand open, and ever the censer swings, 
As they bow to a 
mystic symbol, or the figures of ancient kings; 
And the incense rises ever, and rises the endless cry 
Of those who are heavy laden, and of cowards, loth to die. 
For the Destiny drives us together, like deer in a 
pass of the 
hills. 
Above is the sky, and around us, the sound and the shot that 
kills ; 
Pushed by a 
Power we see not, and struck by a 
hand unknown; 
We pray to the trees for shelter, and press ou-r lips to a 
stone. 
The trees wave a 
shadowy answer, and the rock frowns hollovt 
and grim, 
And the form and the nod of the demon are caught in the twi-
light dim ; 
And we look to the sunlight falling afar on the mountain crest, 
Is there never 
it path runs upward to a 
refuge there and a 
rest 2 
39 
The path ah I 
who has shown it, and which is the faithful 
guide? 
The heaven, ah! who has known it ? for steep is the mountain 
' side. 
For ever the shot strikes surely, and ever the wasted breath 
Of the praying multitude rises, whose answer is only death. 
Here are the tombs of my kinsfolk, the first of an ancient name, 
Chiefs who were slain on the war- field, and women who died in 
flame; 
They are gods, these kings of the foretime, they are spirits who 
guard our race— 
Ever I 
watch and worship; they sit with a 
marble face. 
And the myriad idols around me, and the legion of muttering 
priests, 
The revels and rites unholy, the dark unspeakable feasts I 
What have they wrung from the silence ? 
Hath even a 
whis-
per come 
Of the secret-
Whence and Whither ? 
Alas I 
for the gods are 
dumb. 
Shall I 
list to the word of the English, who come from the 
uttermost sea? 
" 
The secret, hath it been told you, and what is your message 
to me ? " 
It is nought but the wide-world story how the earth and the 
heavens began, 
How the gods are glad and angry, and a 
Deity once was man. 
I 
had thought, " Perchance in the cities where the rulers of 
India dwell, 
Whose orders flash from the far land, who girdle the earth 
with a 
spell, 
They have fathomed the depths we float on, or measured the 
unknow main—" 
Sadly they turn from the venture, and say that the quest 1.14 
vain. 
' 
40 
_e, then, a 
dream and delusion, and where shall the dreamer 
awake? 
Is the world seen like shadows on water, and what if the mirror 
break ? 
Shall it pass, as a 
camp that is struck, as a 
tent that is gathered 
and gone 
From the sands that were lamp-lit at eve, and at morning are 
level and lone ? 
Is there nought in the heaven above, whence the hail and the 
levin are hurled. 
But he wind that is swept around us by the rush of the rolling 
world ? 
T. te wind that shall scatter my ashes, and bear me to silence 
and sleep 
NV id the dirge, and the sounds of lamenting, and voices ol 
women who weep. 
ONLY A PIN. 
ANONYMOUS. 
Only a 
pin; yet it calmly lay 
On the tufted floor in the light of day; 
And it shone serenely fair and bright, 
Reflecting back the noonday light. 
Only a 
boy ; yet he saw that pin, 
And his face assumed a 
fiendish grin : 
He stooped for a 
while with a 
look intent, 
Till he and the pin alike were bent. 
Only a 
chair; but upon its seat 
A 
well-bent pin found safe retreat; 
Nor had the keenest eye discerned 
That heavenward its point was turned. 
Only a 
man ; but he chanced to drop 
Upon that chair, when, fizz—bang—pop 1 
He leaped like a 
cork from out a 
bottle, 
And opened wide his valve de throttle. 
Only a 
yell ; though an honest one, 
It lacked the element of fun ; 
And boy and man and pin and chair 
In wild confusion mingled there.

febrifuge I What as exorciser of evil spirits I 
Better than a 
walk before breakfast, or a 
nap after dinner. 
How it shuts the 
mouth of malice, and opens the brow of kindness I Whether 
it discovers the gums of infancy or age, the grinders of folly or 
the pearls of beauty ; whether it racks the sides or deforms the 
countenance of vulgarity, or deep lines the visage, or moistens 
the eye of refinement—in all its phases, and on all faces, con-
torting, relaxing, overwhelming, convulsing, throwing the hu-
man form into happy shaking and queaking of idiocy, and 
turning the human countenance int6 something appropriate to 
Billy Button's transformation, under every circumstance and 
everywhere a 
laugh is a 
glorious thing. 
Like a " thing of 
beauty" it " a 
joy forever." 
There is no remorse in it. 
It 
leaves no sting except in the sides, and that goes off. 
Even 
a 
single unparticipated laugh is a 
great affair to witness. 
But 
it is seldom single. 
It is more infectious than scarlet fever. 
You cannot gravely contemplate a

If there is one 
laughter and one witness, there forthwith are two laughters. 
And so on.

TWENTY " CLUB. 
G. Li. JESSCYr. 
We dined together, twenty strong, 
That glorious summer weather, 
For half our lifetime's little span 
Had been lived out together. 
And schoolboy friendships, schoolboy loves, 
Such rapid plants in growing, 
Were canvassed o'er and toasted deep 
In Champagne's vintage flowing. 
And then the youngest spoke his mind, 
And put the question whether 
We should not fix an annual day 
To meet and dine together. 
The day was fixed, the hour and place, 
And joining hands in promise, 
We swore that naught but: death itself 
Should take our banquet from us. 
And then the youngest spoke again, 
" 
If death should bar our meeting, 
Well dine, and keep the lost one's placQ, 
And give his ghost a 
greeting. 
The spirit land must spare our dead, 
For it has shades in plenty ; 
This party meets here once a 
year 
With places laid for twenty." 
And so we pledged ourselves again, 
And from the table starting, 
With bumpers crowned and clasping hands, 
We sang the song of parting. 
And, ere we went our several ways, 
Exchanged our farewell greeting, 
Each drinking down the farewell toast, 
" 
To our next merry meeting." 
We met next year; the table still 
Was laid with twenty covers, 
And schoolboy friends exchanged once more 
The tales of schoolboy lovers. 
But one chair was unoccupied, 
And at our farewell greeting 
But nineteen voices spoke the toast, 
" 
To our next merry meeting." 
The club met on; and it seemed strange, 
Amid our youthful faces, 
To count each year the growing sum 
Of sadly vacant places. 
And when the wine cup flowed most free, 
And wit was quick and plenty, 
We always missed some song or jest 
In our diminished twenty. 
It almost seemed as if death frowned 
Upon our fond alliance, 
And sent our members far too fast 
His cartels of defiance. 
One toast, indeed, became each year 
More solemn and commanding; 
" 
Our absent friends," and it always 
Was drunk in silence, standing. 
In '61 our club sat down 
With seven vacant places; 
The table seemed but half-filled up 
By thirteen smiling faces. 
Thirteen ! they say the number is 
Unlucky. 
Well, sincerely 
We never called our number less, 
,'or twenty met there yearly. 
45 
3,`L35 
14,1 
.94 
But that year was the worst we had 
Since our first toast was given. 
In ' 6.2 the club sat down, • 
And we were only seven. 
And when we toasted absent friends 
In annual communion, 
We had to sigh for six brave lives, 
Laid down to guard the Union. 
Those war years bore upon us hard, 
But still we never faltered, 
Though the long line of empty chain, 
Told how the club was altered. 
For time, and war, and accident 
Have left their deadly traces ; 
Last year one friend and I 
sat down 
'Midst eighteen empty places. 
I 
go to finish out the plan 
Arranged that summer weather, 
When, years ago, we twenty swore 
To dine to-day together. 
I 
know that my last friend is dead, 
I 
know it will be lonely, 
With nineteen empty places laid, 
And one place taken only. - 
Still we will meet ; if not in flesh 
In spirit they are present, 
Perhaps they find that dinner still, 
As once they found it—pleasant. 
I 
do not know, such themes as these 
Are past my understanding ; 
But I 
must toast my absent friends 
Alone, in silenav, 
47 
A FACE. 
BARTON GREY. 
There is a 
face I 
remember, 
Clear through the shadow of years; 
I 
can see it to-night so plainly— 
Except now and then for my tears. 
A 
face you woeld not hav:.? fancied ; 
It would have meant nothing to you ; 
But to me it has just been the one thing 
To dream of illy whole life through. 
There never was aught between its, 
She never looked into my heart ; 
Friend unto friend spoke greeting ; 
Friend as from friend did part. 
The summers have flushed and faded 
So often since last we met, 
I 
am sure she does not remember— 
I 
know I 
cannot forget. 
For the face is here in my dreaming, 
It walks with me everywhere ; 
The clear dark eyes gleam on me, 
Glimmers the golden hair. 
The faces of men and women 
I 
meet with every day 
Pass and vanish—but this face 
Can never fade away. 
Whether in life's hard journey 
The eyes have lost their light ; 
Whether the mouth's pure sweetness 
Quivers with pain to-night. 
I 
know not, knowing only 
It changes not for me; 
That face my heart keeps safely, 
And my eyes shall never see.

Till; THREE KINGS. 
THOMAS DUNN ENGLISH. 
THREE kings there are to rule the world, and mightier none 
could be; 
Howe'er he strive no man alive from their control is free. 
And one is yellow, and one is black, and one is white as snow— 
The yellow one is the elder one, but not the stronger though. 
By these and theirs the world's affairs are rigorously controlled; 
And the names these mighty monarchs bear are Cotton, Coal, 
and Gold— 
Cotton, the white, and Gold, the bright, and Coal, the sooty-
grim— 
Each sways a 
potent sceptre o'er the many who bow to him. 
They are not rival sovereigns, but close allies and friends; 
And each controls the other, and each to the other bends; 
And each is kin to the other, and strangely, by my troth, 
For Gold is son of Cotion and Coal, though born before them 
both. 
King Cotton in the Southland dwells, far in the South alone; 
The heavy hoe his sceptre is, the dented gin his throne: 
King Cotton in the Southland dwells, and there his court he 
holds, 
And there his servants gather the fleece from a 
hundred thou-
sand folds: 
King Cotton in the Southland dwells, but roams as suits his 
whim; 
And h2 is free on every sea—no port is closed to him. 
Though like a 
cowled and corded friar in rope and sackcloth 
drest, 
The nations clap their hands for joy when comes their welcome 
guest; 
To build him stately ships they rob the forest of its trees; 
They rend the solid rock to rear his hives of human bees; 
-4 
I 
49 
And from their toiling peasantry they send in every land, 
A 
countless host of servitors to wait at his command; 
Wherever in our Northern clime his smile of favor beams, 
Arise the castles of his peers on the banks of pleasant streams. 
Ay ! peers are they whom serfs obey in many a crowded 
room— 
The barons of the spindles and the nobles of the loom. 
One time good Gold was got by arms, but now our Cotton. 
lords 
By spinning-jennies win their wealth, and not by knightly 
swords. 
King Cotton is a 
kindly king—through him, in autumn time, 
Green fields grow white in the morning light, with the snow 
of the Southern clime; 
Through him the loaded barges go, drawn on their many trips; 
Through him the beryl seas are flecked with stout and gallant 
ships; 
Through him a 
myriad shuttles click, and countless spindles 
whirr; 
Throng-
1i him the smoky towns arise, with all their din and 
stir. 
A 
rain of woe would pour around were Cotton cold and dead; 
Then were not countless millions clad, then were not millions 
fed. 
A blight upon his flowery fields, the world with fear would 
pale, 
From quivering lips in crowded streets break famine's feeble 
wail; 
But while he flourishes in pride, then woe and want are 
banned, 
Swarth labor laughs and sings at toil, and plenty fills the land. 
King Coal dwells ever underground, surrounded by his 
gnomes, 
Who carve him chambers in the earth, and scoop out rocky 
dome, 
50 
Ever they work by torch-light there—the clear sun never 
shines 
To glad the heart of the pigmies toiling, moiling in the mines, 
But still they burrow like patient moles, they work and gayly 
sing, 
Their voices ringing through the vaults in praise of their grimy 
king. 
Black are the diamonds of his crown, and black his robes also, 
Yet though Cotton and Gold may reign above, this Coal is king 
below— 
Down in the bowels of England, where first his rule began, 
The torrid Chiriqui region, the strange land of Japan, 
Ohio's river-riven plains, Virginia's ridges tall, 
And the hills of Pennsylvania, these own him one and all. 
Yet his a 
sway on upper earth—a 
sway it may not shun— 
He spreads o'er crowded cities a 
murky cloud and dun; 
His is the roar of furnaces, the rattling noise of mills, 
The scream of the river steamer, fling back from banks and 
hills; 
His are the one-eyed Cyclops that speed on the iron rails, 
Through echoing clefts in riven hills, and down the pleasant 
vales. 
He comes from his home in the rock profound, to wake the 
busy din, 
With the voice of his steam- surf, roaring like the sound of a 
culverin; 
He goes to the broad green prairies, to the desert plains of 
sand, 
And one is peopled with thousands, and the other is fertile 
land— 
Where yesterday the wild-deer roved, and the hunter's rifle 
rang, 
The sun-burst fierce of the forges glows, and the ponderous 
hammers clang. 
4,. 
51 
Gods I 
what a 
sight, those forges bright, and what a 
steady 
roar— 
The voice of the nor'west tempest on the lone and rocky 
shore; 
The stithy of Hephaistos grim, the halting son of Zeus, 
Glowed not so fierce what time he forged the shield of Achil-
4 
leus; 
And never,the giants sweaty and huge, in Etna's fiery hall, 
More terrible seemed than these appear, as the hammers rise 
and fall. 
King Coal beheld the swarming towns, in the silent hours of 
night, 
It refuge for assassins in the dim and faint lamplight; 
Then pity filled his royal heart; the blood from out his veins, 
And the spirit within him he gave to light the darksome streets 
and lanes. 
The craven murderer at the glare shrunk baffled to his den, 
And Coal another blessing gave to glad the souls of men. 
King Gold was once of low estate; he rose from out the earth; 
A 
base-born carle he was at first—he knew not whence his 
birth. 
Man found him lying in the sands, a 
friendless outcast there, 
And took the yellow foundling home, and gave him treatment 
fair. 
So base of mind, so vile of heart, and so forgetful he, 
That o'er his friend he rules as though he were of high degree. 
King Gold was once of low estate, but now in palaces, 
Whereof he has in every land, he dwells in royal ease— 
Palaces rare and splendid, he owns them everywhere; 
Their walls of lapis-lazuli, and studded with rubies rare, 
Propped with pillars of Parian marble, lined with malachite, 
And hung with silken curtains, that temper the noonday light. 
He feeds upon the choicest meats—upon his board must be 
The pates brought from Strasbourg, and turtle from the sea; 
52 
53 
And in his cups of amethyst that glitter there and glow, 
'The wines of oldest vintages in amber currents flow, 
Madeira, of the south side, Champagne, and Rucellai, 
Johannisberger, Xeres, Catawba, and Tokai. 
King Gold one time was meanly clad in dusky yellow vest, 
But now in purple velvet robes, and silken hose is drest; 
On satin cushions takes repose, with vases in the room, 
To hold rare flowers that all the air with delicate scents per-
fume; 
Around him are his ready knaves, his wishes to attend; 
Around him are his parasites in homage low to bend. 
When human kings array their hosts, he says—" ' Tis not my 
will ! " 
He calms the tempest ere it bursts, and whispers—" Peace ! 
be still ! " 
War hushes at his steady glance, and at his potent word, 
To a plowshare turns the keen-edged lance, a 
sickle is the 
sword. 
The battle comes not now from kings; for leave to fight they 
call 
On the cabinets of the Juden-Strasse, Lombard street, and 
Wall. 
There never was in Pagan lands idolatry profound 
As that which now in Christendom bows millions to the 
ground. 
King Gold goes forth like Juggernaut, the earth beneath him 
reels; 
Down fall the blinded worshippers before his chariot wheels; 
The zealot slaves are blissful all, crushed, writhing on the 
sod— 
The dogs made friends with Cotton and Coal, but worshipped 
Gold as God. 
These are the kings whose thrones we serve, and much we 
praise them when 
They feed the hopes, and shape the course, and aid the will of 
men. 
Without the three but poor we be, the world were sad and 
drear, 
And man a 
savage churl indeed, if neither king were here. 
So laud to Gold, who bears our purse, to Coal, whose toil is 
sore, 
And greater laud to Cotton who feeds ten million men or 
more. 
King Coal a 
mighty monarch is, but nathless is controlled 
To do the work of Cotton, and swell thb pride of Gold; 
King Gold has empire widest far, yet, though it chafe his soul, 
Ile tribute pays to Cotton, and a 
heavy tax to Coal; 
But Cotton lie is king of kings, and Coal, the black and grim, 
And Gold, the yellow and smiling, are vassals both to him. 
TIE WORLD IS FULL OF ROSES. 
A 
JAMAICA FARMER. 
THE summer wind is sniffin' round the bloomin' locus trees; 
And the clover in the pastur' is a 
big day fer the bees, 
And they ben a-swiggin' honey, above-board and on the sly, 
Till they stutter in their buzzin', and stagger as they fly. 
The flicker on the fence-rail ' pears to jest spit on his wings, 
And roll up his feathers, by the sassy way he sings; 
And the hoss-fly is a-wettin' up his fore legs for biz, 
And the off mare is a.switehiu' all of her tail they is. 
You can hear the blackbirds jawin' as they foller up the plow— 
Oh! they're bound to git their brekfast, and they're not a-carin' 
how; 
So they quarrel in the furrers, and they quarrel on the wing— 
But they' -^ peae9,abler 1u pot-pies than in any other thing. 
54 
And it's when I 
git my shot-gun drawed up in stiddy rest, 
She's as full of tribbleation as a 
yaller-jacket's nest; 
And a 
few shots before dinner, when the sun's a.shinin' right, 
Seems to kinder-sorter sharpen up a 
feller's appetite 
They's ben a 
heap o' rain, but the sun's out to-day, 
And the clouds of the wet spell is all cleared away, 
And the woods is all the greener, and the grass is greener stilt; 
It may rain agin to-morrow, but I 
don't think it will. 
Some says the crops is ruined, and the corn's drownded out, 
And prophesy the wheat will be a 
failure, without doubt; 
But the kind. Providence that has never failed us yet, 
Will be on hand oncet more at the 'leventh hour, I 
bet I 
Does the medder lark complain, as he swims high and dry, 
Through the waves of the wind and the blue of the sky ? 
Does the quail set up and whistle in a 
disappointed way, 
Or hang his head in silence and sorrow all the day ? 
Is the chipmunk's health a-failin'? 
Does he walk, or does he 
run ? 
Don't the buzzards ooze around up there just like they've allus 
done ? 
Is there anything the matter with the rooster's lungs or voice ? 
Ort a 
mortal be complainin' when dumb animals rejoice ? 
Then let us, one and all, be contented with our lot; 
July is here this morning, and the sun is shining hot. 
Oh ! let us fill our hearts up with the glory of the day, 
And banish every doubt and care and sorrow far away l 
Whatever be our station, with Providence for guide, 
Such fine circumstances ort to make us satisfied; 
For the world is full of roses, and the roses full of dew, 
And the dew is full of heavenly love that drips for me and 
you. 
55 
A BUNOH OF PRIMROSES. 
DAGONET. 
I AM only a 
faded primrose, dying for want of air: 
and my drooping sisters lie in a 
garret bare. 
We were plucked from the pleasant woodland only a 
week 
4 
ago, 
But our leaves have lost their beauty, and our heads are bend-
ing low. 
We grew in a 
yellow cluster under a 
shady tree, 
In a 
spot where the winds came wooing straight from the Sus-
sex sea; 
And the brisk breeze kissed us boldly as we nodded to and 
fro 
ill the smiling April weather—only a 
week ago. 
Only a 
week this morning! Ah, me! but it seems a 
year 
Since the only dew on our petals was a 
woman's briny tear; 
Since the breeze and the merry sunshine were changed for this 
stifling gloom 
And the soot of the smoky chimneys that robs us of our bloom. 
We grew in a 
nook so quiet, behind a 
hedge so high; 
We were hid from the peeping children who, laughing, passed 
us by. 
But a 
primrose gatherer spied us—his cruel hand came down; 
We were plucked in the early morning and packed and sent 
to town. 
We were tossed in a 
busy market from grimy hand to hand, 
'Till a 
great rough woman took us, and hawked us about the 
Strand; 
Clutched in her dirty fingers our tender stalks were tied, 
And " A 
penny a 
bunch, who'll buy 'em 
tine primroses I" 
she cried. 
I 
56 
We 
lay on the woman's basket till a 
white-faced girl came 
past: 
There was, 0 
such a 
world of yearning in the lingering look 
she cast— 
Cast on the tumbled bunches—a 
look that seemed to say, 
" 
0 
if I 
only had you ! "—but she sighed and she turned 
away. 
She was only gone for a moment, and then she was back 
again; 
She'd the look on her pale pinched features that told of the 
hunger pain: 
She held in her hand the penny that ought to have bought her 
bread, 
But she dropped it into the basket and took us home instead. 
Home—how we seemed to wither, as the light of day grew 
dim, 
And up to a 
dreary garret she bore us with weary limb; 
But her clasp it was kind and gentle, and there shone a 
light 
in her eyes 
That made us think for a 
moment we were under our native 
skies. 
She stole in the room on tiptoe, and " Alice," she softly said, 
" 
Sec what I've brought you, Alice !" Then a 
sick girl raised 
her head, 
And a 
faint voice answered: " Darling, how kind of you to 
bring 
The flowers I 
love so dearly—I've longed for them all the 
Spring. 
" 
I've thought of it so often, the green bank far away, 
And the posies we used to gather— it seems but the other day. 
Lay them beside my pillow, they'll last as long as I— 
How quickly in cruel city the country blossoms die I '' 
4 
57 
We pined in our gloomy prison, and we thought how sweet 
we were 
Blooming among the hedgerows out in the balmy air, 
Where we gladdened the eyes that saw us all in our yellow 
pride, 
And we thought how our lives were wasted as we lay by a 
sick 
bedside. 
We thought how our lives were wasted until we grew to 
know 
We were dear to the dying work-girl for the sake of the long 
ago; 
That her anguish was half forgotten as she looked upon us awl 
went 
Back in her dreams to the woodland filled with the primrose 
scent. 
We primroses are dying, and so is Alice, fast; 
But her sister sits beside her, watching her to the last, 
Working with swollen eyelids for the white slave's scanty - 
wage, 
And starving to save her darling and to still the fever's rage. 
We stand on the little table beside the sick girl's bed, 
And we know by the words she murmurs that she wanders in 
her head; 
She stretches her hand to take us, and laughs like a 
child at 
play— 
She thinks that she sees us growing on the old bank far away. 
Forgotten the gloomy garret, the fierce and the fevered 
strife— 
Forgotten the weary journey that is ending with her life; 
The black, black night has vanished, and the weary work-girl 
hies 
Back to the country childhood, plucking a 
primrose prize. 
58 
We have banished awhile her sorrow, we have brought back 
the sunny smile 
That belongs to the children:s faces in the days that are free 
from guile. 
The Babylon roar comes floating up from the street below: 
Yet she-lists to the gentle plashing of a brook in its spring. 
tide flow. 
The gurgling brook in the meadow, with its primrose-laden 
brim— 
How thick were the yellow clusters on the bank where she sat 
with him, 
With him who had loved and lost her, who had trampled a 
blossom down, 
Ah, me ! for the country blossoms brought to the cruel town 
Thank God I 
for the good, brave sister who found the lost one 
there; 
Who toiled with her for the pittance that paid for '
that garret 
bare; 
Who slaved when the wasted fingers grew all too weak to sew, 
And hid all her troubles bravely, that Alice might never 
know ! 
We have brought one country sunbeam to shine in that garret 
bare; 
But to-morrow will see us lifeless—killed by the poisoned air, 
Then the primrose dream will vanish, and Alice will a: sk in 
vain 
For the poor little yellow posy that made her a 
child again. 
On to our faded petals there falls a 
scalding tear, 
As we lie to-night on the bosom of her who held us dear. 
We shall go to the grave together—for the work-girl lies at 
rest. 
With a 
faded primrose posy elpyped to her icy breast.

Twenty years from now we'll live, I 
don't know how; 
Twenty years from now, the future will astound us— 
It's hard to tell what will take place in twenty years from 
now. 
Yes, times will change from day to day, and so will people too. 
The bank cashiers will not skip out to seek for victims new; 
The ladies will not bang their hair so low upon the brow, 
A dude you'll not find anywhere, in twenty years from now. 
Twenty years from now, etc. 
A 
coachman then will not be found, they'll all be millionaires, 
With wealthy wives they'll travel round, like railroad bulls and 
bears ; 
The ladies then will take the reins, while unto faith they bow, 
,And drive the darling coachman out, in twenty years from now. 
Twenty years from now, etc. 
In politics we'll all agree, no matter who the man, 
We'll have to pay no lawyer's fee, the country's vote to scan: 
Good men to office will be sent, each faithful to his vow— 
Ben Butler'll run for president, in twenty years from now. 
Twenty years from now, etc.

THE GERMAN FIFTH. 
Written and sung by Gus Viramuots. 
Copyright, 1876, by Gus Wnalems. 
OF 
you look at me your eyes oud, 
You viii see a 
soldier gay, 
I 
belong to de German Fifth, 
Dot promenades along Broadvay; 
Den ve have de German colors, 
Alit de Red, de Vile, de Blue, 
grid ve alvays look so 'lobby 
Yen ve march de city drough. 
CHORUS. 
Double rank, vatch dot flank, 
Don't dot vos a 
splendid drill ? 
Mark dot time, ain't dot fine, 
Yen ye march ve don't stand sdi'll; 
Hoop- a- la, shout hurrah ! 
Dot's de raw dot's sure to kill; 
Rite face aboud, turn inside oud— 
Hurrah, for the German Fifth. 
%Ten ye vos in dot army, 
Ye got fed on barrel- staves, 
Und ven vu don't vos fight 
Ye had to vork at digging graves; 
Und ye got so awful slim 
Dot you could see us drough und drongb, 
Vile ve vas oud a- marching, 
Den our feet mere plack und plue. 
Double rank, e -
Now ye vos home-guard privates, 
Ye got blenty grub to ead, 
Und all vos jealous of us, 
Yen me valk along de sdreed; 
But den dot doesn't matter, 
For wherever ye may go, 
Ve show such splendid marching, 
In de rain, or drough de snow. 
Double rank, etc.

This book contains a 
greater variety of really choice selections for the 
above uses than can be found in any similar publication. 
Under the proper 
heads will be found :
Dedicatory Pieces, and brief and beauti-
ful extracts suited to every age and condition in life ; Childhood ; 
IT-onth; :11. ,1Canhood; 13eauty; 
Marriage; 
13irthday and other Amni -versari es, all have their appro-
priate sentiments presented in well-chosen pieces, many of which now 
appear in print for the first time. 
The entire alphabet of A CroStiCS 
on proper names, male and female, is also given, and such an array of 
-Valentine Verses as were never before brought together in one 
volume. To crown all, a 
splendid collection of '
Toasts, suitable to 
almost every social event, whether public or private, are given. 
The aim 
of the compiler has been to include only such selections as are most strik-
ingly appropriate in each department, and not, as in other similar works, to 
string together by the hundred a 
mass of poetical extracts, with little or no 
arrangement, and less fitness for the purpose intended. 
The book is strongly bound in handsomely illuminated stiff paper cover.
