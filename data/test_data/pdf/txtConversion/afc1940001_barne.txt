21 E A3W. F. BARNEY MC SHANE
This song, BARNEY MCSHANE , learned from my brother Bogue who lieanred learned it from Walt
Culver, Boulder City, Nevada.
When the clouds began to gather and the thunder it did rollDown the lane came Barney
McShane,And just as he was passing by the Widow Adam's doorAh, what a shame ? it started to
pourAnd he looked in there so longingly at the comely widow's gate,When she hollered, "By the ?
and won't cha waitsYou ought'a come in out of the rain, Barney McShane,And sit down until the sun
comes out again."It's a cup of tea I'll brew just enough for me and youAnd we'll cuddle up together,
and we'll talk about the weather,Barney dear."Ah, there's a queen, she's the sweetest little thing
you've ever seen.She said, "If you like the likes of me like I like the likes of ye, y' Oughta come in out
of the rain, Barney McShane.
