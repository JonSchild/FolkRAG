Dear  Dan Sheehy :
and Rose Morgan,
 
We have just  completed  the second field producti on  for
 
our program on  Minto dance,  music,  and  language.
 We did  it on
 
borrowed money and promises.
 The fish was here .
:
and so was our
 
two weeks of  summer.
 Happily they coincided and we had  a great
 
production.
 Everything  is on  schedule except our  paperwork
 
alliance with  NEA.
 We have sent  in  all  the forms we have
 
received.
 The last one being  sent over a month ago.
 People tell
 
me NEA stands for  Naturall y Endangered Artist  and to get  a grant
 
you join  the club.
 We' ve used up  all  my savings and most of  my
 
friends savings knowing  full  well  the check
:  is  in  the mail.
 
I certainly appreciate your  looking  into this matter.
 
Could  it  be that  there is another  form we don't  know about  that
 
needs to be filled out?
 The Minto Village Council  has sent  in
 
the compliance assurances and  the request  for payment.
 As far  as
 
I know those are the onl y ones we have received.
 I am now
 
getting ready to send  in  the second  payment  request.
 Our  fall
 
season  is approaching.
 We expect snow in  three weeks.
 September
 
will  bring  the Minto Fl ats moose season  and a potlatch--both
 
necessary el ements to the program.
 
Pl ease  let  me know when  you find out  anything  at
 
9 07 - 672-3262.  The tel ephones should be working  again by the ti me
 
you get  this letter.
 
Thanks.

A Friday night moan
  
Q
. Why was Winston F
leury so astonished when he didn't get his Folk Arts ad and
 
Expansion Arts grants?  We had a
ll been warning him, we had been spelling out
 
all the things he had t
o do, each step he would have to take... He hadn't done
 
any of them really, he hadn't, we thought, taken us seriously...
 
A
. Just s
o.  Winston had heard our words but never really believed them.  He
 
took them, I think, t
o be the kind of ritual s
tatements the big world requires
 
of i
ts functionaries.  From the f
irst moment we met, Winston had set himself to
 
the creative task of making relationships -
- getting his kula ring into order,
 
establishing his cultural s
tatus, initiating Dan and Alan and Jeffry and me
 
into his family, getting a
ll the power people and all the power words (
folklorist,
 
anthropologist) onto his s
ide.
 
That waw what his culture required of him as a cultural leader, and he did it
 
very well.  We a
ll told him so, we told him we were friends, and we l
iked him
 
and approved of what he was doing (
or what he dreamed, l
ike all the great
 
chieftains, he was doing).  By virtue of the easy bestowal of our affections,
 
we had s
ignalled we were truly bound t
o him by every t
ie of family or of c
lan,
 
and so he could take our critiques, our nit-picking instructions, to be simple
 
formalities, just part of the routine, nothing really important.  We were on his
 
side.
 
So what happened was that we betrayed him.  We didn't come through l
ike relatives
 
should, and that's the bitter size of i
t.  From our s
tandpoint, our genuine
 
affection for Winston, our endless patience that extended beyond patience into
 
simple endurance, our boundless ability to accept his unboundedness was unrewarded
 
by the l
east c
oncession on his part (
viz. taking our requests seriously).
 
So are we all betrayed, Winston, of course, the more because his vision i
s so
 
intense and s
o narrow.
 I
t must be terribly hard for him to swallow his pride
 
yet once again and approach us.  No wonder his language i
s s
o magniloquent,
 
so extravagant.
 I
t's truly heartening.  By God, con-man or &Rxixxx no, genius
 
or phony, Winston F
leury i
s a splendid human experience, and I wish he'd get
 
his act together....

Dear Dr. Cassidy-
Now pleasant to be recalled from my usual round of business
 
to a world in which an ooch is as important as a megabuck.
 
I had wondered what you were making of that rather strident
 
meeting we had at the Humanities; I shall
. be honored if
 
a small addition to your dictionary is one of its positive
 
results.
 
I recall the word from my childhood  (
I grew up in central
 
Texas -- Austin and Dallas), and my brother and sister confirm
 
my impression that the term was in general usage there at
 
least by the 1920's.
 It was always a verb in our usage,
 
meaning very slightly shoved or manipulated, and it could
 
be used in the active or passive mode.
 Your exemplary sentance
 
was quite correct.
 
In enquiring around from some of my colleagues at the Endowment,
 
however, a friend  (about 30 years old)  said that he had
 
heard 'ooch" used as a noun during his boyhood in the Pennsborough
 
and White Oak region of hest Virginia.
 "We made it by an
 
ooch" was the sentence he aave me, sometimes elaborated to
 
"we made it by an ooch and an eek.", or "It's just an ooch
 
away from here."
 I must disclaim any such usage in Texas;
 
it's clearly a West Virginia anomaly.
 
You have now piqued my curiosity about the term;  if I run
 
across any more examples or a wider provenience, I shall
 
take the liberty of writing you again.
 
Cordially,

I am the person who sat around the corner of the table to
 
your left at the NEH meeting with the folklorists nearly a month
 
ago.
 You remember that I am making a dictionary--see letterhead.
 
I miss no chances to pick up interesting words and I think I heard
 
you say one that we had not recorded before.
 What I wrote down
 
was:
 They kept on gradually ooching me to do the work,  and at
 
last I accepted.
 
Did I hear this correctly?
 Do you know and use the word ooch? 
It's very expressive and in context needs no explanation.
 But I
 
don't want to put it in the Dictionary unless I know that it has
 
some currency--and that I heard it correctly in the first place.
 
Anything you can tell me about it--how familiar it is, whether
 
you connect it with a certain part of the country or with a certain
 
person or group of people, will be most helpful.
 I enclose a re-
turn envelope.

Thanks so much for your excellent letter about ooch. 
I am
 
glad my sharp ear was working that day and that I was just around
 
the corner of the table from you--otherwise DARE might never have
 
had an ooch entry.
 Now we shall have it.
 I'll check it out in
 
other places than Texas and West Virginia for various meanings.
 
I am especially glad to be assured of its reality.
 Otherwise,
 
for me,  it might have remained no more than a variant of ouch, 
perhaps used when the pain is less.
 
I am glad you felt that meeting was "rather strident."
 The
 
humanities people kept their cool so admirably!
 But it seemed to
 
me the best demonstration of a pressure group that I had seen.
 
I sympathize with the folklorists but my head did not go all the
 
way with my heart.
 There must be limits to what one can support
 
and one cannot follow enthusiasms indiscriminately.
 Yes,  I won-
dered what good,  if any,  I was doing there--but I learned something!
 
I
'll be very glad to have further information on ooch if you
 
get any.
 I sorta,  kinda ooch you to get some.

.O. Box 1341

Dear Paula,
 
It is Sunday morning March 1
, 1981
. and I have just finished watching t
he
 
Charles Kurault show.
 
I guess you got left on the cutting room floor, and I
'm sorry about that,
 
but it was worth it (
at least to me ) if it meant getting one second longer
 
to watch Son Thomas in t
he school classroom . Paula, I was really shaken.
 
Here was a down-home Mississippi black man singing old-time blues and talking
 
about hard times to an every day class full of children in a Mississippi
 
public school and the whole thing was being
; broadcast over national television
 
just as though it weren 't anything special at all, as though it was just as
 
ordinary an occurrence as the scenes of the Jackson ballet or the blind ladies
 
feeling
; the sculpture in the sculpture park.
 
I still don't quite believe it.  This is my sixtieth birthday year and I have
 
watched and worked and worried for a pretty long time ;
 maybe it was all for
 
that one minute . I wonder if even you, as an experienced young southerner
., have
 
the least idea how many things had t
o happen before that minute could go out
 
over the Columbia Broadcasting
, System -- how many attitudes changed just a
 
whisper, how many people died, how many born, how many encounters from a brush
 
to a
. blow, how many words written, muttered , orated, swallowed printed , carved
 
into stone.
 
I am talking art, you understand ,
 not politics -- except insofar as politics i
�
,
 
the art of the possible . Ten years ago, five years ago, Son Thomas wouldn't
 
have thought in his wildest dreams that he could sing in that school, the
 
school wouldn 't have considered having him, the parents wouldn't have approved,
 
the school board would have rejected the idea, the Arts Council wouldn't have
 
helped, you wouldn't have been on the job to s
nake the arrangements and there
 
would have been no federal support.  I guess the thing t
hat struck me so powerfully
 
was how normal it all seemed ,
 how everyday- a toe dancer and a museum docent
 
and a country blues picker and a short story writer and an actor, all doing
 
their bit , speaking their piece , giving their particular testimony to truth
 
and life and art.  I kept thinking for once , for just those few minutes , people
 
can see how i
t could be done right.

_
 
Well, in any event, my heartiest congratulations to Son and to you, and to
 
Lida, and to all the Mississippi folks who must have helped and contributed
 
to that show and to your FAIS program.  And my congratulations, too, to the
 
people who weren't there and never could be there but who played a part in
 
making southern Americans realize that in their own blues they had contributed
 
an indigenous art form that would forever represent Mississippi in the musics
 
of the world.  They were a part of it too.
 
Yours always,

.I. Building, Room 217
 
Smithsonian Institution
 
Washington, DC  20560
 
Bear Mr. Ripley,
 
I write in some concern following our brief interchange after your splendid
 
dinner party for the American Folklife Center Board.  If you recall, I
 
brought up the issue of bilingual_ education -- a not very appropriate topic,
 
it occurs to me now, for a well-filled and appreciative guest to raise on
 
the very doorstep.
 
My only excuse i
s that the subject is of critical importance, and widely
 
misunderstood.  Let me propose a "
simple solution' -, one which would turn the
 
whole issue on i
ts head, and bring a new perspective to bear on the problem.
 
Let us advocate boldly that now is the time when the educational system in
 
the United States should dedicate itself to the goal of making every child
 
in this nation -- majority and minority -- bilingual.  Almost every other
 
nation in the world requires of its children some proficiency in two, and
 
sometimes more, languages.  Such an official policy on our part would enable us
 
to join the world community on a more equal footing.  It might even improve
 
our diplomacy.
 
We have led the nations in the task of making every citizen
 
now raise our sights even farther.  Every child in American
 
enabled to acquire a reasonable proficiency in English (
our
 
and in one other language.  Thus, while
 Chippewa-speaking
 
English, English-speaking children can be learning Spanish,
 
as appropriate.
 
You are a scientist.  Let me give you two case histories.
 
literate.  Let us
 
schools can be
 
national language)
 
students are studying
 
French, or Chippewa,
 
Case A.  Bess Lomax Hawes was taught to read at the age of four (
in English,
 
her native tongue), and instruction in Latin was begun at t
he age of six.  By
 
the time I was t
een, I was half-way through Virgil's Aeneid in the original
 
Latin, had polished off Caesar's Gallic Wars, and had had six months instruction
 
in conversational French.  I was regarded as educationally advantaged, and I
 
concur with that opinion.  I was not exactly bilingual, but I was certainly
 
linguistically experienced.
 
i
 
- 2
 
Case B
.  "Maria Gonzalez", a graduate student at the California college where
 
I taught, was born in the Los Angeles barrio and reached the age of six speaking
 
only Spanish.  She was put into a school where instruction was given only in
 
English and managed, by Herculean efforts, to learn to read in a language that
 
she did not, at the time, understand.  I respected her enormously.  One day I
 
asked her casually what books she had read in Spanish while she was growing up.
 
She said, none.  I said, well, a newspaper, magazines?  She said, noneo there
 
weren't any.  With increasing incredulity, I discovered that she had never known
 
that Don Quixote had originally been written in Spanish; she had never heard of
 
Lorca's poetry, nor of the work of any Latin-American novelist.  I took her t
o
 
the Spanish literature section of the college library and left her there,
 
bemused and weeping.  She had never before realized that real books had
. actually
 
been written in her own language.  Maria had been classified as educationally
 
disadvantaged, and I concur with that verdict, too.  She was linguistically
 
far more sophisticated than I
, but she had received educational maltreatment of
 
the first order.
 
What irony.  What educational malpractices, what ethnocentric brutalities have
 
gone uncorrected under the guise of
. "Americanizing" the foreign-born and their
 
children.  Of course, English is our national language.
 (
So it i
s in Chana and
 
in Nigeria, as far as that goes.)  Of course, every American citizen must learn
 
a reasonable competency in our national tongue.  But we could also require that
 
every American child learn that other languages exist, that these languages are
 
in every case noble attempts by different kinds of men to communicate their own
 
especial view of reality and of man's destiny, that the study of these varying
 
tongues will enrich and refine our ability to express the ultimate human truths.
 
Within this context, our "foreign-speaking" students might eventually come to be
 
regarded as assets to our society, rather than deficits.
 
I speak with passion, because you are an important intellectual leader, and your
 
words are heeded.  This i
s a time when reaction is more seductive than action.  I
 
too am weary of the sometimes shrill and tendentious voices of the many, many
 
have-nots that surround us.  But this seems to me a moment when boldness just
 
might work, when a straightforward and clear call to the future might set us on
 
a new path, might re-shuffle the weary contending; f
orces and unite us in a new
 
cause with a new perspective.
 
Anyway, I
've tried.
 
Respectfully yours,

so  
course,
 
Thank you for your comprehensive letter of Octob
 
7th.
 Of course,  I could not agree more that to be bi- o
 
tri- lingual is a splendid growing up experience for any
 
child.
 This is not an issue in my mind.
 It should be,
 
-

ment will be enhanced by being able to speak more than on
 
language.
 I
 
-2-
reason to impose additional languages in such formal terms
 
for the purposes of government or day-to-day business.
 The
 
same thing  has been happening in India, which in its short
 
history as a Republic, has been convulsed a number of times
 
as between the Centre and the States over the issue of 17
 
or 18 regional languages which the State Legislatures at-
tempt to impose on the Centre as formal and official re-
quirements.
 Of course,  in India the problem has to do with
 
the semantic connotations of the word "English" which has
 
been acting as a dead horse on which to beat for a number
 
of years, symbolizing a whipped up political antipathy to
 
the British.
 The fact of the matter is if a government is
 
to achieve effective training in technological and other
 
skills today,  a single language is highly preferable in
 
which to conduct the business of that government,  as well
 
as skilled training.
 I am sure you will agree on that
 
point.
 
Thus you see,  I am sure, we do not differ in
 
principle,  for I too learned French really before English,
 
as you yourself learned Latin by the age of 6.
 All of these
 
experiences are vital in growing up.
 
With kind regards,  I am,
 
Sincerely yours,

Pear Virginia,
 
Here's the letter I told you I had written.  I
'm afraid I still feel exactly
 
the same way.  I
'm also enclosing a short article that you might not have
 
seen that raises some interesting questions on ethnicity.
 It comes from a
 
newsletter published by a Hungarian-American Association in New Jersev, and
 
was written by its president, Kalman Magyar.
 If you're not acquainted with the
 
group, stop by and I can give you their address: they are doing some nice things.
 
Yours,

Dear Virginia,
 
This is just a personal note responding to the article you and Mr. Watman wrote
 
on "Washing Out the Intimate Details of Ethnic Culture."  The copy before me was
 
sent me by the Idaho State Folk Arts Coordinator.  I have several other copies
 
as well, forwarded for my interest by people from other sections of the country.
 
You surely get good coverage.
 
That being the case, I feel particularly ead that you used your important forum
 
as you did.  It happens so many times:  hard-pressed people so often choose to
 
lean on their friends rather than their enemies, perhaps because they believe
 
they can count on their friends to hold still for the treatment.  And so here
 
we go again -- the pitifully small handful of people in the country who care
 
the least bit about ethnic culture (
of which I
'm one) read your article and
 
wind up more neurotic and unsure of ourselves than we already were:  the Smithsonian
 
folks a bit less willing
, to stick their necks out, the folklorists a bit less
 
willing to get "involved" in public sector activities.  They were suspicious
 
enough already.
 
Did you happen to read Secretary Ripley's article tin the Smithsonian some months
 
ago when he practically called for a return to the melting pot theory and
 
implicitly chided the Folklife Festival for presenting "polyglot" cultures on
 
the National Mall?  Why didn't everyone speak English, he enquired, at the
 
Festival?  (
I am paraphrasing, not having his article in front of me, but it was
 
truly a frightening series of statements from a person of his stature.  I wrote
 
him a letter of protest concerning his attack on bilingualism, and he answered
 
me most politely but didn't take back a single word.)
 
We have real enemies.  We are in extremely difficult times.  Surely you could
 
have found a really bad festival to criticize publicly in a national publication,
 
instead of one of the few that is making a serious effort to do the job well.
 
And why a whole article of criticism anyway during* this desperately depressing
 
summer?  Isn't this a time to try to help each other keep our spirits up and
 
our courage high?

Washing Out t
he I
ntimate Details o
f E
thnic Culture
 
Last year as  I attended the National  Gallery
 
of Art's East W
ing exhibit of South Sea  I
sland
 
artifacts,  I was s
truck by the beauty of an
 
enormous, hand-carved wooden bowl.
 I was
 
fortunate enough to attend the show w
ith an
 
anthropologist, and r
aved to h
im about the
 
burl of the wood,  the craftsman's  r
espect for
 
the grain of wood, and the mark of the carver's
 
hand upon the form of the bowl.
 
My companion smiled.
 He asked me what  I
 
thought this grand p
iece of art had been
 
i
ntended for.
 I
ts great s
ize told me  i
t must
 
have been  important, so I guessed i
t had been
 
used to prepare some k
ind of ceremonial  feast.
 
"
Indeed," he said, "
it  i
s the very utensil  i
n
 
which the foreign  i
nvader was scalded and pre-
pared for consumption by a cannibalistic
 
tribe."
 
When he explained the r
itual  s
ignificance of
 
this and nearby objects, my appreciation for
 
them was  radically a
ltered.
 
Though other objects  i
n the exhibit  i
ncluded
 
explanations,  this one d
id not--it was to be
 
appreciated for i
ts beauty only.
 The curators
 
had chosen to spare us  i
ts brutal  reality.
 
Museum curators,  l
ike educators, news and
 
entertainment programmers and other profes-
s
ionals who i
nterpret ethnic l
ife to the
 
public, often edit out or fail  to explain
 
the  i
ntimate details of a group's culture --
i
ts treatment of r
itual, death, sex, sacri-
f
ice and survival.
 The culture on d
isplay
 
i
s thus "cleansed," and the public  i
s
 
thought to be no worse off for what  i
t  i
s not
 
told.
 
The heart of a culture i
s by necessity pri-
vate --
i
t could not survive otherwise.
 Thus
 
many ethnic groups are reluctant to reveal
 
i
ntimate details of their r
ituals.
 Group mem-
bers show only the prettiest components of
 
their culture.
 Fearing others w
ill  not under -
stand them,  they Americanize the menu.
 They
 
may w
ish to avoid the i
ndignity of having
 
their culture m
isunderstood.
 They may even
 
believe that by sharing a r
itual  they will
 
cause i
t to be degraded,  to lose i
ts special
 
meaning.
 
For example, my grandmother never gave the
 
correct  i
ngredients to any recipe she passed
 
on, and that's why her cooking was so impor-
tant.
 I
f you wanted that special  taste,  she
 
had to cook i
t.

The 1= e sti v al o
f American Folklife:
 
Out o
f P
lace, Out o
f T
ime
 
The accompanying article poses the question:
 
Can ethnic fairs and folk art shows ever be
 
anything more than shallow presentations of
 
a culture?
 
We put  this question to a variety of artists,
 
musicians,  craftsmen and others who i
nterpret
 
ethnic and  r
egional  culture to the public at
 
the annual  Festival  of American Folklife  i
n
 
Washington,  D
.C.
 
The festival  has been an  important showcase
 
for ethnic arts s
ince  i
t was  i
nitiated by the
 
Smithsonian  I
nstitute and the National  Park
 
Service  i
n  1
966.
 I
t  i
s the only event of  i
ts
 
k
ind accessible to many federal  policy makers.
 
Approximately 200,000 people v
isited the
 
festival  i
n 1
980 despite cold October weathe r
 
Among the groups participating i
n the 1
980
 
festival were "American Talkers," which
 
featured auctioneers, carnival  "pitchmen"
 
and street criers from a
ll over t
he countr y
 
A delegation from Georgia,  r
epresented in a
 
section called "Community Activities and Food
 
Preservation," made barbeque sauce, canned
 
fruits and vegetables and demonstrated quilt-
i
ng,  ham smoking and w
ine making.
 Craftsmen
 
from the region constructed a "dog-trot"
 
house, an energy-efficient dwelling popular
 
i
n the South for 200 years.
 Musicians p
layed
 
f
iddles, guitars, banjos and harmonicas.
 
The festival  a
lso i
ncluded the foods, crafts,
 
music and dance of Americans of Caribbean,
 
F
innish and Southeast Asian heritage.
 
The participants we  i
nterviewed shared a common
 
d
ilemma: what  l
evel  of understanding about
 
their group would they be able to communicate
 
through the festival?
 Many ethnic groups
 
assume the uninitiated public w
ill  be unable to
 
Washing Out E
thnic Culture .. . (
Continued from Page 1
)
 
understand the i
ntimate details of their
 
cultures.
 Other groups fear they w
ill  l
ose
 
their  i
ntegrity i
f they share those details
 
with outsiders.
 
Our f
irst  impression had been that  festival
 
participants were grateful  for the
 
opportunity to share their cultures w
ith
 
other Americans.
 But after talking with
 
many of them i
t became c
lear that
 
the festival  was at odds w
ith the traditions
 
of the participants and the stated objectives
 
of the sponsors.
 Some of their comments
 
follow.
 
A Carnival  Out of Season
 
A Caribbean Carnival  Parade had been p
lanned,
 
i
n the words of one Smithsonian organizer,
 
"to g
ive v
isitors a taste of what  i
t's  l
ike
 
to take part  i
n Carnival, a holiday celebra-
t
ion that  lasts for several weeks  i
n the
 
Caribbean."
 
Karl  Herbert came to Washington from Trinidae
 
At the festival  he talked about the i
nteqral
 
e
lement of competition  i
n costume design that
 
exists  i
n the Caribbean.
 "Here we are really
 
not competing," he said.
 "There are not so
 
many of us here.
 We can be more  l
ax."
 
He explained the d
ifferences between the Car-
i
bbean Carnival  i
n Trinidad and i
ts  recreatic
 
a
long Constitution Avenue.
 "At home," he
 
said, "more people would be doing this  (makir
 
costumes)  together, and four or f
ive people
 
would work on a s
ingle costume.
 I
 would not
 
be s
itting here a
lone.
 People would walk by
 
stop and voluntee r
 The materials are the
 
same.
 The patterns are t
he same, but at homt
 
I
n spite of their misgivings, ethnic groups
 
do communicate some of their culture through
 
folk festivals.
 I
n some ways festivals can
 
be more  i
nformative than t
he textbooks which
 
have g
iven us  i
mages of drum-beating, dancing
 
Redskins  or the f
lashy neon s
igns of
 
Chinatowns and other commercialized ethnicity.
 
But  folk festivals are  l
imited i
n their abil-
i
ty to convey culture.
 Sponsors and organiz-
ers often have very d
ifferent needs and
 
motives than participants.
 Sponsors may see
 
festivals as part of urban r
evitalization.
 
E
thnics may s
ing and sell  sausages.
 V
isitor
 
may come and spend money.
 The impressions
 
they a
ll  take away from a festival may be ve
 
much at odds w
ith the reality of the culture
 
portrayed.
 
I
f we are to build an honest  r
espect for
 
ethnic culture we must develop a more r
igoro
 
approach to educating each other and the
 
public.
 We must acknowledge the l
imitations
 
of popular expressions of ethnicity and try
 
f
ind ways to express the private s
ides of
 
ethnic culture.

to make costumes.
 
An assistant costume designer
 
val, who hails from Brooklyn,
 
were few s
imilarities between
 
Washington and the r
eal  t
hing
 
for the carni-
conceded there
 
the parade  i
n
 
i
n Trinida d
 
"Well,  t
he excitement  i
s d
ifferent," he said.
 
"
In Trinidad,  i
t goes on for two days contin-
uously,
 Large numbers of people make a d
iff-
erence.
 One  i
ndividual  band could have thou-
sands of people  i
n i
t,
 More people are  i
n-
volved,
.
 And the cold.
 I
t would not be this
 
cold.
 That makes a d
ifference,  too."
 
The mood a
long the Carnival  Parade route was
 
rather subdued, according to one Caribbean
 
American.
 "This d
istinction between the spec-
tators and participants, so sharply delineat-
ed, would not occur  i
n Trinidad.
 This
 
e
lement d
istinguishes this experience from
 
the actual  carnival,
 Perhaps only  some
 
would wear costumes, yet others w---
id feel
 
equally part of the event  i
n thei
- Dwn way.
 
A
ll would make the preparations a
-= celebrate
 
together."
 
A Taste
 
Connie W
illiams was chosen to demonstrate
 
Caribbean cooking at the festival.
 "More
 
people need to know about this so-t of thing,"
 
she sai d
.
 "
I want to serve what people don't
 
have at home."
 
W
illiams, a professional  cook and former
 
proprietor of Caribbean restaurants  i
n New
 
York and San Francisco, c
laimed '
'
there i
s
 
r
eally no Caribbean-style cooking."  Rather,
 
she explained,  i
t  i
s a m
ixture of African,
 
E
ast  I
ndian and Chinese cuisine.
 
W
illiams c
laimed the food she served at
 
the festival was the same traditional  food
 
served  i
n the Caribbean American community,
 
But when asked about the banana pancakes she
 
had prepared,  she admitted the  r
ecipe was not
 
traditional, but her own.
 What traditional
 
foods d
id W
illiams cook i
n her own k
itchen?
 
"
I  don't cook at home," she said. "There's
 
never any food at my house.
 I make coffee."

courtesy of
 
d
ishes at the festival, said she could not
 
offer sticky r
ice because  i
t took too l
ong to
 
prepare.
 She d
id make khao-puon  (
rice noodle
 
soup),  but  l
eft out  the hot pepper, a crucial
 
i
ngredient.
 "
I  used paprika to g
ive i
t the
 
red color," she said.
 "
It g
ives Americans at
 
l
east a chance to taste a traditional  d
ish."
 
A striking example of culture taken
 
out of context  i
s that of a Cambodian sculptor
 
who had been  i
n the country only ten months.
 
He was selling h
is stone carvings at the
 
Festival  just months after  l
eaving the temple
 
at Angkor-Wat, where he carved religious  i
cons
 
as part of a spiritual  community.
 
Another problem was evidenced by Festival
 
staffers'  habit of referring to traditional
 
V
ietnamese dresses,  still worn on a variety of
 
occasions, as "costumes."
 
Festival Transplants  
Some participants promote the marketable s
ide
 
of themselves or their groups at the festival.
 
-HOW AND TELL
 
. .
 
I
so
-linda`Campbell, a Cuban native who l
ives
 
i
n Washington, D
.C., owns a Botanica- -a shop
 
that sells  r
eligious articles,  love potions,
 
candles,  i
ncense and o
intments.
 When asked
 
to explain the mystical  s
ignificance of the
 
Botanica, she said that  i
t took too much t
ime
 
to explain.
 Campbell  c
laimed she "didn't know
 
too much" about the meaning of certain dolls
 
she sold  i
n a booth at the festival.
 She a
lso
 
sold  i
cons and symbols, but kept  their mean-
i
ng to herself.
 
After v
isiting "Laskiainen," a m
id-winter
 
F
innish-American festival  i
n M
innesota, offi-
c
ials from the Smithsonian  i
nvited some of the
 
participants to Washington for the Folklife
 
Festival.
 Laskiainen, which originally had
 
been a pre-Lenten festival  (
the F
innish equiv -
a
lent to Carnival)  became i
n Washington a pre-
sentation of music, dance, food and crafts--
a festival  twice r
emoved from an authentic
 
event.
 
As folk culture moves farther and farther
 
away from i
ts origins,  i
t needs more  i
nter-
pretation for outsiders who are l
ess familar
 
w
ith that group.
 Despite the hard work of the
 
folklorists  i
nvolved,  the Festival was  i
n many
 
ways  i
nauthentic,  l
argely because of the
 
contrived nature of any festival.
 
The professionals assumed that too much detail
 
communicated l
ittle to the uninitiated, pre-
fering to p
ick out a few general  i
tems  (
as  i
n
 
the example of the Caribbean Carnival)  that
 
are l
ikely to be more familiar to more people.
 
I
n some  i
nstances  (
as  i
n the South Sea  I
sland
 
exhibit),  the professionals s
imply l
eft out
 
i
nformation that m
ight prove embarassing to
 
the group or provoke charges of racism from
 
the outside.
 Ethnic groups, ever protective
 
of their private s
ide, were encouraged to
 
promote the l
ighter s
ide of their cultures,
 
r
evealing only t
hat part of their ethnicity
 
w
ith which people would feel  comfortable.
 
i
 
The process of the festival  raises some
 
troubling questions.
 The participation of
 
communal  groups seems to authenticate the
 
festival,  but a festival  i
s a l
imited means
 
for presenting ethnic culture.
 The  impres-
s
ions we receive at ethnic festivals may be
 
very much at odds w
ith the culture that exists
 
i
n communities.
 Culture may not be portable.
 
The problems  r
aised by the festival  raise
 
questions about the role of professionals and
 
staff who organize them.
 What sort of train-
i
ng should be required for them?
 How can
 
ethnic groups communicate part of their
 
private s
ide w
ithout  l
osing their  i
ntegrit�-
L
imited notions of ethnicity, perhaps, are
 
rooted i
n the r
esidue of the "melting pot"
 
image that still  persists  i
n some segments
 
of American society.
 I
nherent  i
n that  image
 
i
s the belief that ethnicity does not have
 
a profound effect on people's  l
ives.
 I
t
 
i
s this v
iew that l
eads professionals to
 
attach l
ittle contemporary value to ethnicity,
 
and explains why many folk festivals fail
 
to communicate that what a group expresses
 
about  i
ts culture  i
s just as  important as
 
how they express  i
t.
 And i
t  i
s why so many
 
ethnic groups tend to downplay the more
 
practical, problem-solving s
ide of their
 
cultures  i
n the belief that t
here are aspects'
,
 
!of their i
dentity that are better left
 
untouched.
 
What motivates the festivals'  professional
 
sponsors and i
ts participants may vary,
 
but  i
n the end,  the price we pay for
 
p
lacing unnecessary r
estraints on ethnicity
 
i
s h
igh.
 Behind every shallow attempt at
 
cultural  sharing l
ies the r
isk of losing
 
the ability to appreciate and l
earn from
 
our cultural  d
iversity.

Folk Arts panelist E
. Richard Hart, Executive Director of the Institute of the
 
Northamerican West, Albuquerque, New Mexico, brought the attached document
 
along with him to the last Folk Arts panel meeting.  He has been acting as an
 
advisor to the Zunis for a long time now and indeed was with them when this
 
case first went to court some fifteen years ago.  He feels rather triumphant
 
that the Zunis won but more importantly that Finding 23 (
page 21 - Zuni
 
Migration Tradition recounted) suggests a precedent that traditional narrative
 
(
oral literature) has "evidentiary probity," at least as far as Zuni traditional
 
myth and legend go.
 
I thought you might find this case of interest and that it probably should go
 
into the Endowment legal files.  We deal in Folk Arts with this kind of
 
literature in various projects as does the Literature Program though we've
 
never been called into court over any of our grants!
 I just thought we ought
 
to keep it around....

I am enclosing a check for the sloop fund that you inadvert-
ently enclosed with your letter to Annette Mader.
 If I can
 
find her letter and address,  I shall certainly send yours
 
along to her.  What such people need,  I believe, much more
 
than money ) is caring -- plain old t.l.c.  They need to be
 
taken seriously and they need to take themselves seriously,
 
so that they put on the best, most deeply-considered, care-
fully-thought-about festival that ever happened.
 
But'all the thinking and research and ideas in the world
 
aren't worth anything if the love isn't there to begin with.
 
Every once in a while, during this crazy job of mine,  I think
 
about once when the children were small and we were poor and
 
they went to a very working-class, not very good public
 
school.
 They had a Halloween carnival on the playground and
 
I went over during the afternoon and visited the little booths
 
they had put up -- a fish pond and a bean bag toss and
 
various little games like that.
 It was a benefit carnival
 
for the PTA,  so everything cost a little bit -- two cents or
 
a nickel -- very exciting.  Anyway, one of the booths had
.
 
those nasty little crushed paper leis you used to see
 
around -- purple and hot pink and yellow -- selling for a
 
penny apiece.
 The lady who ran the booth was black, and
 
she was playing awful fake Hawaiian pop music on a tinny
 
little phon!raph, and she had
. on a fake grass skirt over her
 
housedress, and it was altogether tawdry and awful.  Since
 
I had met her at the PTA,  I complimented her insincerely on
 
how nice her booth looked
., and she looked at me with a big
 
generous smile and said,  "I put this booth up every year,
 
Mrs. Hawes.  I just think it's so good
. for children to learn
 
something about how it is to live in another part of the
 
world!"

The folks always know what the problem is.
 I went home think-
ing that she was doing a heck of a lot more about world peace
 
than I was with all my cultural pretensions.
 She was putting
 
herself on the line in her way, the best way she knew, and we
 
must put ourselves on the line in our ways, the best we know
 
too.
 The crazy thing to me about this job is that the only
 
thing we have to work with is money.  Most of the time, you
 
think that if you only had enough money,  everything could be
 
all right.
 Not true.

The 
 next time you come down,  I
'll show you what the Luiseno
 
Indians of southern California did with time, patience,  love,
 
expertise,  concern, professionalism, unity,  clear thinking,
 
devotion -- and $6,000 of Folk Arts money.
 It's almost
 
parenthetical.  Anyway,  it made my week.

What I would like to see in 1
985;
 
1
)  Twenty-five self-supporting ethnic (
or regional American) tours on the
 
road twelve weeks per year each.
 
2
)  A state folk arts coordinator in every state (
whether employed by the
 
Arts Council, the Historical Society or the Parks and Recreation Department).
 
3
)  A t
raining program in every agricultural college to educate county agents
 
to recognize and encourage traditional artists.
 
4
)  A series of annual non-public--performance-centered convocations similar
 
to the Centrum fiddlers bash model where old and young musicians and
 
artists could foregather to exchange skills, repertoires, i
deas.
 
5
)  A series of small businesses that can supply traditional craftsworkers
 
with their needs:  crochet and other special thread, particular weaves
 
of cloth, musical instruments, beads, hides, etc., etc.
 
6
)  Neighborhood traditional artists, from banjo pickers to duck decoy
 
carvers, employed as traditional artists in residence in a minimum
 
of t
en school districts in every one of the states and territories.
 
7
)  A maximum effort on the part of the federal government to make available
 
t
o every ethnic, Native American and regional culture the f
ederal
  
holdings relevant t
o their particular artistic and cultural  history.
 
8
)  A non-academically-based, but academically-supported, effort to develop
 
a cadre of young, energetic, well-informed, culturally sophisticated,
 
sensitive, and dedicated workers to see that all of the above is super-
latively well done.
