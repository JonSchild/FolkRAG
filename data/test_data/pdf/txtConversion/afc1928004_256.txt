GUS WILLIAMS' " LATEST AND BEST" 25 CENT SONGSTER. 
TO THE PUBLIC. 
BEFORE I 
write a 
word upon the subject of this new Song 
Book, I 
feel that I 
must give my hearty and sincere thanks to 
that generous Public that have, by their liberal support, made 
my path in life so pleasant. 
Not only have my songs as sung by 
me been " applauded to the echo which did applaud again," but 
when printed they have been purchased and perused with such 
avidity as to prove that they have a 
permanent popularity. 
Of 
course I 
am not vain enough to attribute all this to the intrinsic 
merit of my verses or melodies. 
I 
know that much of my pop-
ularity arises from the fact that I 
have been careful to weed out 
every thought or word that could possibly offend the most 
scrupulous; being well convinced that Mirth is by no means a 
necessary companion to Vulgarity. 
Of course with success has come imitation, and herds of fel-
lows, with a 
plentiful lack of brains, but an abundance of brass, 
have tried to " steal my thunder," and, like their proto-type, 
BoTrom, have loudly shouted, " Let me play the lion's part." 
But their career has been as short-lived as it was stupid, and 
they have sunk out of sight like bubbles upon a 
swamp pond. 
" 
There let them sink," as the famous three 11Id Richard 
says. 
tillS WILLIAMS' " LATEST AND BEST" 25 GENT SONGSTER. 
In giving yet another book— my " Latest and Best "— to the 
press, I 
have only to say in explanation that I 
am from tune to 
tin.-
te producing original pieces, and for these I 
am constantly 
receiving applications. 
If I 
had as many hands as Briareas, I 
could not supply all these orders. 
So I 
find the easiest and 
most satisfactory course for me to pursue is to publish this vol-
ume. 
If it has anything like the success of my previous popu-
lar Song Books, my publisher will find to his delight that 
" 
there's millions in it !" 
It is with great pleasure hat I 
sign myself 
Tire Public's most grateful Servant, 
NEW YonK, July, 1875.

SINCE 'TERRY FIRST JOIN ED THE GANG. 
COMIC SONG. 
Words by Wm. SCANLON. 
Music by Wm. CnoNrit. 
The Music of this song is published by E. II. IIARDING, 220 Bowery, New 
York. Price 10 cents. 
MY 
name it is Mike Slattery, 
And from Ireland I 
came, 
And I've a 
son who's a 
big blackguard, 
And Terence is his name; 
He wears a 
gold watch and chain, 
And he calls it a " super " and a " slang." 
Oh, my heart is broke, God knows it is, 
Since Terry first joined the " gang." 
CHORE'S. 
He'll come rolling home in the morning, 
And he'll give the door the devil's own bang; 
Oh, my heart is broke, God knows it is, 
Since Terry first joined the " gang." 
When he came home last Thursday night, 
Sure, I 
talked to him very nice ; 
When he said, " Old man, you're getting too fresh, 
And we'll soon have to put you on the ice." 
He told the old woman for to take a 
drop, 
And to shut up giving him her slang; 
Oh, her heart is broke, God knows it is, 
Since Terry first joined the " gang." 
He'll come, etc. 
Sure, he stands upon the corner 
From morning until night, 
And if the policeman says " move on," 
he'll spit at him with spite ; 
He went to the market only yerterday, 
And there he stole a " wipe" and a " slang;" 
Now he's got three months in the Penitentiary, 
Along with the rest of the " gang." 
He'll come, etc. 
ABOUD DREE MILES AVAY.

Am.—" Mulcahy's Gone Away." 
Da man I'm going to sing aboud, 
Vonce lived in New York town; 
Und in Avenue A, de beoble say, 
Dot he gained gread renown. 
He dought he vos a

But he got licked vone day, 
Und dey sent him up to Blackvell's Isle, 
Aboud dree miles avay. 
CHORUS. 
He vos big und grand, und blayed in a 
band, 
Vent oud on Padrick's day; 
But now he's up -on Blackvell's isle, 
Aboud dree miles avay. 
He stayed ub dere dree months or more, 
Und ven he did get back, 
As a 
politician he did run, 
Bud he got de outside drack; 
Und dot made him so awful vild, 
He killed a 
man dot day; 
Und again he vent to Blackvell's Isle, 
Aboud dree miles avay. 
He vos big und grand, etc. 
His friends dey said he vos insane, 
Und so he vos led oft"; 
He den got drunk und dravelled round 
Along mit John B. Gough. 
He got to be a

Und almosd every day, 
He shows some vone to Blackvell's 1818, 
Aboud dree miles avay. 
He vos big und grand, eta.

When I

I 
embarked in public life,

rugged road, 
Bestrewn with care and strife; 
I 
speculated foolishly, 
My losses were severe, 
But still a 
tiny little voice 
Kept whispering in my ear ;—Cno. 
Then I 
studied strict economy, 
And found, to my surprise, 
My funds instead of sinking 
Very quickly then did rise. 
I 
grasped each chance, and always struck 
The iron while 'twas hot, 
I 
seized my opportunities 
And never once forgot :—Cno. 
I'm married now and happy, 
I've a 
careful little wife, 
We live in peace and harmony, 
Devoid of care and strife; 
Fortune smiles upon us, 
We have little children three, 
The lesson that I 
teach them, 
As they prattle round my knee :—CFro.

MULCAHY'S GO.Isi.b AWAY. 
Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1574, by E. H. 
HAnnrso, 
in the Office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington, D. C, 
The Mtffie of this song is published by E. H. 
H.A.M37NG, 268 Bowery, New 
York. Price 10 cents. 
Words and Music by Josnpn P. Slannue 
Tat hero of my humble song 
Was once a 
mighty man, 
A 
shining light in his neighborhood, 
And chief of all his clan; 
But when he found in course of time 
The tricks his friends did play, 
Sure he left them all, and now they cry, 
Mulcahy's gone away ! 
He was great and grand. and took command 
Of the boys on Patrick's day; 
But now the cry is everywhere, 
Mulcahy's gone away. 
He won our pride and won our praise, 
And he deserved it too: 
Sure many a 
time for nights and days 
We stuck to him like glue; 
He held an office of the State, 
And faith he made it pay; 
But for such a 
place he was too greet. 
And now he's gone away! 
He was are-at, etc„ 
The politicians worshipped him, 
And swore he'd yet be Mayor; 
And tho' the chance looked rather dim, 
He thought it bright and fair; 
(1) 
MITI,CAHY'S GONE AWAY. —Continued. 
But ere he came to rule the town, 
His mind was led astray, 
And now the cry is ererywbere, 
Alulcahy's gone away! 
He was great, e. 
He was as sound a 
Democrat 
A, ever filled a 
chair, 
But he lost his great position, 
And it drove him to despair; 
We know not where to seek for him; 
He must have crossed the say; 
0, it grieves us just to think of it— 
Mulcahy's gone away! 
He was great, etc. 
He treated us like gintlemen 
Whenever we did meet; 
The sight of him would do you good, 
From his head down to his feet; 
Ii‘.f wore a 
collar stiff and high, 
Which made a 
great display; 
He was a 
most distinguished man— 
But now he's gone away 
He was gat, etc. 
The girls went crazy when he winked, 
And many an artful plan 
They put in operation for 
To catch this darline man; 
But now they're left alone, poor things; 
They weep and wail, and say— 
Oh. what'll we do at all, at all 1

WILL A MONKEY CLIMB A TREE 
Written and composed by JOHN REED, and sung by Gus wILLIAms. 
WHILST walking out the other night a 
girl I 
chanced to meet, 
A 
very simple looking lass, as I 
thought, in the street; 
She had a 
lovely head of hair, a 
dark and rolling eye ; 
I 
ask'd her if she'd walk with me, and this was her reply— 
CHORUS. 
Will a 
monkey climb a 
tree 1 
will a 
fish swim in the sea 7 
Will a 
lawyer take his feel a 
Jew his money lose 7 
Will a 
hackman take his fare'? will a 
barber cut your hair 7 
If they say no, then, dear sir, you I 
will refuse. 
I 
thought her very witty, so I 
to her did say, 
" 
Will you go to a 
music hall to pass an hour away 7 
Now, miss, what do you say to this 7 
your answer, yes or no 7 
Just tell rite what you really think, and if you'd like to go." 
SPOKEN.—" Will I 
accompany you?" she said ; " why "— 
Will a 
monkey, etc. 
I 
hired a 
hack, drove to the hall, and paid the man his fare, 
And when we got inside the hall saw the chairman in his chair. 
I 
shook him by the hand and said, " What will you have with 
me— 
Whiskey hot or brandy cold or a 
glass of soda and B.1" 
SPOREN.—" Will I 
take a 
glass of brandy and water, did you 
say 7 Oh !"— 
Will a 
monkey, etc. 
A 
waiter then he brought the drinks, which came to a 
dollar 
and four, 
The same time saying, " Sir, will you require any more 7" 
I 
gave him a 
ten dollar piece, he looked at me so strange; 
I 
then said to the waiter, " Will you accept the change 7" 
SPOKEN — lie first looked at the gold piece and then at me, 
and quickly putting the coin in his pocket, exclaimed— 
Will a 
monkey, etc.

DOT LEETLE GROCERY STORE. 
PARODY ON "Kiss BEHIND THE DOOR." 
ONCE I 
was so gay like a 
pigs as live in clover, 
But now into a 
bundle small you see I 
pine away; 
I 
once had plenty sweitzerkase und beer, but dot is over, 
I 
have to live on free lunches und eat one meal a 
day. 
SPOKEN.—I
'll tole you how it vos. 
You see, I 
vos clerk in a 
green grocery store, und Joudy ( Joudy vos my gal) she come 
und buy couple a 
pounds of cheese shust because I 
vos dere; 
den I 
drow in two three pounds. I 
do goot business dot vay; 
und ven de boss come along be say, " Who vos de money for 
dot cheese?" und I 
say, " I 
expose dot vos all right." 
Jowly 
come in de morning when de boss have not got up yet, und I 
vos sweeping oud the store. 
Den I 
shust hurry up, sweep de 
dirt behind de door, leave de broom dere, und make love mit 
Joudy; but— 
CHORUS. 
I 
viii never sweep dot dirt again 
Behind de front shop door, 
I 
viii never leave my business, nein, 
To make love any more; 
I 
loose my situation in dot leetle grocery store, 
Und Joudy have gone back on me now, 
The boss he find some fault, so I 
gond und leave my places, 
He make me pay for all dot cheese dot I 
have gave avay, 
Und veil I 
tell my Joudy she laffin' in my faces, 
Und yen I 
ask de reason vy, dese cords to me she say— 
SPOKEN.—" You great big grossen fool, why you have so 
much foolishness about dot you diuk I 
vos going to marry you, 
ha ?" Den she sneeze at me (dot way), und tell me go ud. 
Well, 
I 
make my mind out, a 
rolling stone is as goot as two in the 
bush anyhow, and dere is not some use in crying for dot milk 
as got spilled on the ground, but I 
can't got me another situa-
tion. 
Well, I 
tole you de truth; you can accommendation by 
me; und if I

There have been men of genius who have died of despair, 
Unrewarded by fortune and fame; 
In vain they have struggled for many long years, 
They could not establish a 
name. 
Perhaps you will ask me the reason—it is: 
Their modesty caused their defeat, 
They've been passed, in the road for position and place 
By some numskull with heaps of conceit.— Cho. 
So if you have talent, don't hide it, my friend, 
That is, if to rise you aspire ; 
The higher you raise it the more men will praise it, 
If you tell them just what to admire; 
For the public will follow the leader, my boys, 
Like sheep that are led to a 
fold ; 
So if you just tell them how clever you are, 
Ten to ens, they'll believe what they're told.— Cho. 
Blow yotv crwn trumpet, and blazon your name, 
Wherever you happen to be; 
Don't wait for a 
herald to trumpet your name, 
If distinguished you're anxious to be. 
Don't w) to the rear. but push on, never fear, 
And do not forget my advice, 
But blow your owl] trumpet as onward you go, 
And you'll get to the front in a 
trice.— Cho.

TIM FLAHERTY. 
The Music of this song is published by Jorrs CHURCH & CO., 66 West 
Fourth St., Cincinnati, 0. 
Price 30 cents. 
I'm a 
light-hearted paddy, a 
rale Irish laddy; 
I 
came to this country strange wonders to say; 
I 
sailed from dear Cork for the port of New York; 
I 
was eighteen long days a- crossing the say; 
When I 
arrived in the land I 
was tuck by the hand 
By a 
blaggard who said, " Paddy, come go with me, 
I 
will show you the city, the sights are so pretty." 
He says, " What's your name 7" Says I, " Tim Flaherty." 
I'm Tim Flaherty, arrah, gaze upon rne; 
A 
light-hearted paddy is Tim Flaherty. 
He showed me around, the sights were soon found, 
I 
viewed them with wonder and astonishment; 
When he bade me good-bye tears came in my eye, 
I 
found he'd been through me, and took ivery clot. 
What to do I 
didn't know; where was Ito go 7 
So I 
wint to the coort, and explained to the judge. 
He called me a 
pauper, a 
vagrant and loafer, 
And give me six months in the Island above. 
I'm Tim Flaherty, arrah, gaze upon me; 
A 
light-hearted paddy is Tim Flaherty,

TT-TT; MONEYLESS MAN. 
By HENRY STANTON. 
Is there no place on the face of the earth 
Where charity dwelled), where virtue has birth! 
Where bosoms in kindness and mercy will heave, 
And the poor and the wretched shall ask and receive 7 
Is there no place on earth where a 
knock from the poor 
Will bring a 
kind angel to open the door ? 
Ah! search the wide world wherever you can, 
There is no open door for the moneyless man. 
Go look in the hall where the chandelier light 
Drives off with its splendor the darkness of night ; 
Where the rich hanging velvet, in shadowy fold, 
Sweeps gracefully down with its trimmings of gold, 
And mirrors of silver take up and renew 
In long lighted vistas the ' wilderina view ; 
Go there in your patches,and find if you can 
A welcoming smile for the moneyless man. 
Go look in your church of the cloud- reaching spire, 
Which gives back to the sun his same look of fire, 
Where the arches and columns are gorgeous within, 
And the walls seem as pure as a 
soul without sin; 
Go down the long aisle—see the rich and the great, 
In the pomp and the pride of their worldly estate ; 
Walk down in your patches, and find if you can, 
Who opens a 
pew for a 
moneyless man. 
Go to your judges, in dark flowing gown, 
With the scales wherein law layeth quietly down ; 
Where he frowns on the weak and smiles on the strong, 
And punishes right while he justifies wrong; 
Where jurors their lips on the Bible have laid, 
To render a 
verdict they've already made; 
Go there in the court- room, and find if you can, 
Any law for the case of a 
moneyless man. 
Go look in the banks, where Mammon has told. 
His hundreds and thousands of silver and gold ; 
Where, safe from the hands of the starving and poor, 
Lie piles upon piles of the glittering ore ; 
Walk up to the counter—and there you may stay, 
Till your limbs have grow old and your hair turns gray, 
And you' ll find at the bank not one of the clan 
With money to lend to a 
moneyless man. 
(I) 
VTR MONEYLESS MAN.—Concluded. 
Then go to your hovel !—no raven has fed 
The wife who has suffered so long for her bread; 
Kneel down by her pallet and kiss the death frost 
From the lips of the angel your poverty lost— 
Then turn in your agony upward to God, 
And bless while it smites you, the chastening rod ; 
And you'll find at the end of your life's little span, 
There's a 
welcome above for the moneyless man. 
JANE AND JEREMIAH. 
Fyn come this evening to complain 
Of the treatment of a 
girl call'd Jane, 
With eyes and hair as brown as a 
nut, 
Whose business place it was in the Cut; 
Penny ices there she sold, 
But like her trade her heart it was cold, 
Her each night I 
hear in a 
dream 
Cry," Lemon ice, raspberry or cream!" 
CEIOUIIS. 
I 
never shall forget that girl 
Whom all the chaps admire, 
Nor yet the names and little games 
Of Jane and Jeremiah 
She used to drive a 
roaring trade, 
And in the ice line money made, 
She turned them out so very nice, 
I 
lived on nothing else but ice; 
But on this fare I 
grew so thin, 
That I 
was merely bone and skin, 
And after all she told me flat, 
She liked a 
fellow short and fat. 
I 
never shall, etc, 
She said that in the summer days, 
The ice line is a 
trade that pays, 
But in the winter, when it's cold, 
There's very little to be sold. 
She met a 
man called Jeremiah, 
Who kept a 
brazier full of fire, 
And who dealt, in ale winter time, 
In baked chestnuts t.nd elder wine. 
I 
never shall, etc.

At night she dances on the stage,

They cries " Brayvo," but little know

There's not such a

She looks so sweet, sitting on a

Sometimes I

From Kitty's sweet lip, 
And make my own hive in her bowers.

I 
would not build nests in the air, 
But keep close by the side 
Of sweet Kitty Clyde, 
And sleep ki her soft silken hair.

DARLING, I 
am growing old, 
Silver threads among the gold 
Shine upon my brow to-day; 
Life is fading fast away; 
But, my darling, you will be—will be 
Always young and fair to me— 
Yes ! my darling, you will be 
Always young and fair to me. 
CHORUS. 
Darling, T 
am growing, growing old, 
Silver threads among the gold 
Shine upon my brow to- day; 
Life is fading fast away. 
When your hair is silver white, 
And your cheeks no longer bright 
With the roses of the May, 
I 
will kiss your lips and say— 
" 
Oh, my darling, mine alone—alone, 
You have never older grown— 
Yes ! my darling, mine alone, 
You have never older grown ! 
Darling, I 
am growing, etc. 
Love can never more grow old; 
Locks may lose their brown and gold, 
Cheeks may fade and hollow grow, 
But the hearts that love will know 
Never, never winter's frost and chill; 
Summer's warmth is in them still— 
Never winter's frost and chill, 
Summer's warmth is in them still. 
Darling, I 
am growing, etc. 
Love is always young and fair— 
What to us is silver hair, 
Faded cheeks, or steps grown slow, 
To the heart that beats below 7 
Since I 
kissed you mine alone, alone, 
You have never older grown— 
Since I 
kissed you mine alone, 
You have never older grown. 
Darling, I 
am growing, ete

W HAT ! no ! it can't be that they've driven 
Their father, so helpless and old, 
(Oh, God, may their crime be forgiven,) 
To perish out here in the cold. 
Oh, Heavens, I 
am sadden'd and weary, 
See the tears how they course down my cheeks! 
Oh, this world it is lonely and dreary, 
And my beat' for relief vainly seeks. 
CHOILUS. 
For I'm old, and I'm helpless and feeble, 
The days of my youth have gone by; 
Then over the hill to the poor house. 
I 
wander alone there to die. 
Al], me! on that old door-step yonder, 
I've sat with my babes on my knee; 
No father was happier or fonder 
Than I 
of my little ones three. 
The boys, both so rosy and chubby, 
And Lilly with prattle so sweet ! 
God knows bow their father has loved them, 
But they've driven him out in the street. 
For I'm old, etc.

OVER THE HILL TO THE POOR HOUSE.— 
Concluded. 
It's long years since my Mary was taken, 
My faithful affectionate wife ; 
Since then I'm forlorn and forsaken, 
And the light has died out of my life. 
The boys grew to manhood; I 
gave them 
A deed fbr the farm! ay, and more, 
I 
gave them this house they were born in ! 
And now I'm turned out from its door. 
For I'm old, etc. 
Oh, children ! loved children ! yet hear me, 
I 
have journeyed along on life's stage ; 
With the hope that you all would be near me, 
To comfort and cheer my old age. 
My life-blo(0 I'd gladly have given, 
To shield and protect you I 
but bark ! 
Though my heart breaks, I'll say it's you've driven 
Me out here to die in the dark. 
For Pm old. etc. 
But, perhaps, they'll live happier without me 
Farewell, dear old home, all ! farewell ! 
Each pathway and tree here about me, 
Some memory precious can tell. 
Well, the flowers will bloom bright as ever, 
And the birds sing as sweet to the morn ; 
Then over the hill from the poor house, 
Next Spring the old man shall be borne. 
For I'm old, etc.

I'x getting old and feeble now, I

Ole rnassa an' ole miss's am dead, dey're sleepin' side by side; 
Deir spirits now are roaming wid de blest! 
De scene am changed about de place, de darkies am all gone;

Dar was a

When de darkies used to gather round de door; 
When dey used to dance an' sing at night I 
played the old banjo, 
But alas, I 
cannot play it any more. 
De hinges dey got rusted an' de door has tumbled down, 
And de roof lets in de sunshine an' de rain, 
An' de only friend I've got now is dis good ole dog oh mine, 
In de little old log cabin in de lane. 
De chimney's falling down, etc. 
De foot-path now is covered o'er dat led us round de bill, 
And de fences all are going to decay, 
An' de creek is all dried up where we used to go to mill ; 
De time has turned its course anodder way ; 
But I 
ain't got long to stay here, an' what little time I

I'll try and he contented to remain, 
Till death shall call my dog an' me to find a

Dan dat little old log cabin in de lane.

To battle his way through life's throng -; 
Oft finds, to his cost, that cold winter's frost

Induced by sal poverty keen, 
That might have been stayed, had an effort been made 
Before he'd such misery seen.— Cho. 
Misfortune's cold shade, visits every glade, 
The rich man as well as the poor; 
Then hesitate not while wealth you have got, 
To help whom you can from your store. 
Ere long it may be fate's cruel decree 
Your hope's fairest prospects to smother, 
You'll surely find then kind, good-hearted men, 
To help you as you've helped some other.— Cho.

are privates in the Sixty-Ninth, 
We follow up the fife and the drain; 
We can't forget our old comrades, 
And their glory at Bull Run. 
It was there with bayonets bristling, 
In the thickest of the fray, 
Where the shot and shell were whistling, 
Our boys help'd gain the day. 
CHORUS. 
We march behind the band, 
True sons of Paddy's land, 
The Irish boys for style are excellent; 
The green above the red, 
With martial step we tread, 
In the gallant Sixty-Ninth Regiment. 
They admit we are the ladies' pride, 
When we're out for a 
grand review, 
They shout huzza from near and far, 
At our Irish boys so true ; 
With columns solid as a 
wall, 
Bright uniforms neat and clean, 
We are one and all sons of Erin, 
From the land of the Shamrock green. 
We march, etc. 
Should America call on her soldier boys, 
To the front we'd boldly go 
For a 
righteous cause, our Nation's laws, 
Give battle to the foe. 
We'll ne'er forget old Ireland, 
But keep our powder dry, 
" 
Faugh a 
ballairh " our cry, clear the way, 
To conquer or to die.

MY VIFE'S BAGGAGE. 
As sung by Gus W ILLIALIS. 
V ENE' tit my wife goes oud of town, I

Und all de family as well, or else dere'll be a 
row ; 
Und I

row will make 
Aboud de piles of baggage, dot my wife will always take. 
SPOKEN.—Every summer we always go to the country, und 
von 1 
lite mit my wife aboud daking so much baggage, she will 
turn around und say—wy, all I've got is— 
A 
large trunk, a 
leetle trunk, de children's hoops und spades, 
A ledder-bag, a 
carpet-bag, umbrella, und sun- shade ; 
Und of brown- paper bundles, dere are only just a 
few, 
A 
brambula.tor, mid a 
dorg, und den thee squirrels, too. 
A 
grockery-box, a 
rocking-horse, a 
foot-stool, und a 
rug, 
A wrapper und an eil-skin coad just for to keep me snug ; 
A 
dressing- case, a 
box of toys, of children dere are three, 
Dot's simbly all de articles dot does belong to me. 
Vone hack I 
try, but by-und-bye, I 
find dot vone won't do, 
kro hold ourselves mid baggage, so, of course I 
order two; 
Und yen I 
pays, de hackman says, he Tants five dollars more, 
Und I 
declare, und vow, und swear, de whole ding is a 
bore.

for moving a

A

Now to my wife I 
olden say, I'll go from home no more, 
But den she doesn't notice dot, she's heard the same before; 
Vot can I 
do, but grunt und groin, I 
cannot have my say, 
For I

SPOKEN.—Of course, she knows best—" Who should know

don't raise a 
family." 
Dot's vot she says to me if I

ALL TEAT GLITTERS IS NOT GOLD. 
in this world of care and trouble, 
Where men toil with hand and brain; 
Seeking fame— that airy bubble--
And not always seek in vain. 
Though the path be strew'd 
ii Ii dowess, 
And tbe,laurels bind his brow, 
All his friends admire his powers, 
lie can do without them now, 
Still he's wasted, worn and weary, 
And he finds he's growing old; 
Remember thou the sage's adage— 
" 
All that glitters is not gold." 
See the warrior, brave in action, 
Ever ready for the fray! 
Sternly, nobly, scents all faction, 
And to freedom fights his way. 
How he bears with cold and hunger, 
Houseless, homeless, 'neath the sky, 
Be must march a 
little longer, 
Till he hears the battle cry. 
Then his soul is filled with glory, 
Tho' his friends lie stark and cold, 
Thus ends many a 
hero's story— 
" 
All that glitters is not gold." 
See that great and mighty noble, 
Rolling in his coach of state, 
Surely he has ne'er known trouble, 
His seems such a 
happy fate; 
Ile has heaps of land and money, 
Lovely wife and children f. ir, 
What a 
grand ancestral dwelling, 
Surely be has not a 
care ? 
Ask his friends and they will ncuttix, 
By his bankers he's been said, 
And this proves the tri.th I 
utter, 
" 
All that glitters is not gold."

Of the noble colored troops, 
Who march about de streets of York, 
In French imperial suits. 
Black pantaloons and yaller stripes, 
And helmets trimmed with blue ; 
Da wenches shout when we turn out, 
On South Fifth Avenue. 
CHORUS.

Music playing sweet and gay; 
Hats a- waving, we're parading, 
Marching down Broadway.

Talk about your Mulligan Guard, 
Dese 'figs dey can't be beat; 
We march to time, we cut a

Just watch dese darkeys' feet. 
De left foot first, de right foot follow, 
De heel down mighty hard ; 
Ten platoons of dandy coons, 
March in the Skidmore Guard. 
Dar's Mister Brown, de waiter man 
To de Astor House hotel ;

On ' Mancipation day.

POPPING CORN. 
kND there they sat a-popping corn, John Stiles and Susan Cut-
ter ; 
John Stiles as fat as any ox, and Susan fat as butter; 
And there they sat and shelled the corn, and raked and stirred 
the fire, 
And talked of different kind of ears, and hitched their chairs up 
nigher. 
Tooral ooral, etc. 
Then Susan she the hopper shook, then John he shook tho pop-
per, 
Till both their faces grew as red as saucepans made of copper, 
And then they shelled, and popped, and ate, all kinds of fun a-
poking, 
And he haw-hawed at her remarks, and she laughed at his jok-
ing. 
Tooral ooral, etc. 
And still they popped and still they ate, John's mouth was like 
a 
hopper, 
And stirred the fire, and sprinkled salt, and shook and shook 
the popper; 
The clock struck nine, and then struck ten, and still the cona 
kept popping; 
It struck eleven, then struck twelve, and still no signs of stop-
ping. 
Tooral ooral, etc. 
And John he ate, and Susan thought, the corn did pop and pat-
ter, 
Till John cried out, " The corn's a-fire 
Why, Susan, what's 
the matter I" 
She said, " John Stiles, it's one o'clock ; you'll die of indiges-
tion ; 
I'm sick of all this popping corn—why don't you pop the quos-

No matter where you journey, 
Some " motto " strikes the eye; 
'Tis well to think upon it, 
And to use it bye and by, 
When you set out on your race, my boya, 
Jog along until you win it; 
Do a 
good turn always while you may— 
You'll find there's millions in it. 
Then a 
cheer for every honest heart; 
May a 
blessing fall each minute 
On a 
worthy deed to a 
soul in need— 
Oh, you'll find there's millions in it. 
Don't frown when days are gloomy, 
Brace up to meet the storm, 
For winter soon will vanish, 
And summer days grow warm; 
With a 
smile of joy for every one, 
Oh, the heart sings like a 
linnet; 
Tim' a 
kind word never costs a 
cent, 
Why, you'll find there's millions in it. 
Then a 
cheer, etc. 
When bright eyes smile upon you, 
And love lights up your heart, 
Don't linger dumb and bashful 
Till the chance to speak depart ; 
When you find a 
heart that is worth the while, 
Persevere until you win it ; 
Speak your mind for an honest woman's lore— 
Oh, my boys, there's millions in it.

When he's trodden in the dust ;

MY LOVE TO TH -

As sung by 31i6 ANNIE ADAMS. 
Arranged by W. S. M ILTON. 
I'm broken-hearted quite, for me there's no delight, 
Oh ! dear, oh ! dear, what shall I 
do 
My love to the war has gone, and left, me here forlorn ! 
Oh dear, oh dear, my hopes are few. 
CHORUS . 
I 
wish there was no fighting, I 
wish there was no wars, 
If I 
the Goddess were of Love, I'd rule it over Mars ! 
Or if our kings and rulers, they must bark and bite, 
Let those who make the quarrel, take upon themselves to 
fight. 
I 
shed tears fast as rain, and when I 
sleep would fain, 
My screams in dreams alarm the neighborhood round, 
For I 
fancy I 
can see my love so dear to me, 
My Fred, there dead, on the cold, cold ground. 
I 
wish, etc. 
I 
cannot sleep at night, and I've lost my appetite, 
Behold, untold, you all may plainly see, 
I'm wasting fast away, by inches, ev'ry day !

By GEOROn H OEY. 
VON nighd I 
thought I'd go ub to der " Garden," 
Yid my girl vat lifs vay off in " Afenue A," 
Cause I 
had some season tickets vat I'd borrowed, 
Von der man vat kept der blace vas cross der vay. 
Yen I 
got into der hall I 
musd do sotneting 
in society to show I'd peen pefore, 
So I 
kissed a 
girl vas dbrinking sherry cobbleshtenes, 
And purdy soon vent slikipping oud der door. 
Dey vas blaying awful purty kind ov moosic; 
Dere vas valzes, bolkas, succotaches, too ; 
Per first ting vas a " solo by a 
quartette," 
Und der nexd vas somevon's " sympathy in Q." 
Bud der besd ding dat I 
saw blayed in my lifetime 
Vas sornet,Ing dat I'm going to relate ; 
It vas Waving ov a 
lettle game ov " poker," 
Yen a 
fellow blayed two pair I 
had a" shtraight." 
I 
shtayed at dat concert party latish, 
Till der hour ov ten slitruck twelve upon der clock ; 
My key-hole it couldn't find my night- key, 
Und my house vas blaying tag around der block. 
My boarding-house keeper vas looking oud der vinder, 
It vas yust so skill you couldn't drop a 
pin, 
Yen a 
great big man, mit shield und club like so big, 
Came and said ; " he thought he'd haf to take me in." 
Now, I 
nexd pefore der judge vas prought ub shtanding, 
Alit two bolicemen py me all der time ; 
Yen der judge said to me, " Vat's your abbelation 7" 
I 
said, " Hans von Nicholas Gilseyhausenheim." 
He wrode dat on a 
gread big sheed ov baher, 
Und den dat kind judge to ine did say : 
"Hans, you go ub to der Island ; it's so bleasant, 
Und sktay dere yust three veeks vrom to- day." 
Und I 
said, " Justice, don't you tink dat's blayed oud, 
Vat you send me to der Island right avay 
Here's der man vat keeps der hoarding house I

Vill shvare him dot I

Und dot he alvays thought me kinder crazy; 
So Justice, von't you blease to think again 7" 
But der judge riFlid on dat point vas lefel headed, 
Said he didn't " vant to make me oud insane." 
So I

But I

Or can haf a

Und all dis came ov going to der " Garden," 
Und drinking beer.

Vat 1 Vere's der girl dat vent dat nighd til; mid me? 
I

"TANE IT BOB ." 
Written and Composed by A 
irrituf: Ia.ovD. 
I'm a 
jolly Oki iii her, Bob Boll is my name, 
And in my own village I'm well known to fame, 
l've a 
wife and a 
daughter, a 
dear little lass. 
I'm fond of them both, and I'm fond of a 
glass. 
Some say, I'm too fond, well, perhaps that may be, 
I 
try to be steady, and am, as you see, 
But if I 
attempt to refuse drink a-day, 
I 
fancy the wheel of the mill stoma to say— 
C1101016. 
Take it Bob, take it Bob, take it Bob, take It Bob, 
That's chat I 
fancy the mill says to me ; 
Take it Bob, take it Bob, take it Bob, take it Bob, 
Take it Bob, take it Bob, it's better than tea. 
I've tried very oft a 
tee tot'ler to be, 
But my mi'l is quite right, nrandy*S better than tea, 
And altho' what I 
aay, you may all think absurd, 
believe what the mill says is right, ' pon my word. 
I 
called on old Jon's 'bout some business, you know, 
And he sal, Bob, a 
pipe and a 
glass, ' fore ye go, 
Now I 
didn't require it, believe what I 
say, 
But altho' a 
mile off, I 
could hear the mill say— 
Take it Bob, 
Now I 
drr,amt fother night that Bob Bell was no more. 
That he'd died at the age of p'rhaps forty or mars, 
And I 
heard people round me say, drink's done its v,-ornt, 
But :litho' I 
was dead, I 
was dying with thirst. 
A bottle of brandy close by I 
could see. 
It was meant for the mourners, it wasn't for me, 
But as on my bed, still and silent I 
lay, 
in the distance distinctly I 
heard the mill say— 
Take it Bob, 
I'm only up here for a 
bit of a 
sproe, 
My wife thinks its business between yon and me, 
And you know the old saying, that never deceives. 
What the heart 110sn 't see why the eye doesn't gyte72. 
I 
must todd c 
at once, so gJod bye to ye all, 
Nest sea ,,on I 
hope I 
shall give ye a 
call, 
Don't ask me to drink when I'm going away, 
Or I'm certain to fancy I 
hear bear the mill say— 
Take it Bob. &a.

GIVE HIM ANOTHER CHANCE. 
Tuts world's a 
cold and selfish one, 
As many thousands know ; 
Who once were blessed with hope and joy, 
But now are fallen low; 
Whose hearts were ever kind and warm, 
Nor turned from grief aside, 
But always lent a 
listening ear 
When pain and sorrow sighed. 
Then let us aid their sad distress, 
For we like them perchance 
May crave the favor of the world, 
To give us another chance. 
We cannot search their breaking hearts, 
To know the anguish there, 
But kindly acts may heal their smart, 
And soothe their sad despair ; 
For many whom you meet to-day, 
In sorrow broken down, 
Possesses hearts as kind and true 
And noble as thine own. 
Then do no not turn away from them 
With cold and haughty glance, 
But lift your fallen brother up, 
And rive him another chance. 
The riches of the world were made 
Not for a 
selfish end, 
But that we generously might spare 
Some for a 
suffering; friend. 
No matter what the faults may be 
Concealed within his heart, 
To save the wretched erring one 
Is a 
true and manly part ; 
Then when you see a 
fallen man, 
With sorrow in his glance, 
Don't crush him farther in the dust, 
But give him another chance.

THERE'S a 
letter in the candle, 
And it points direct to me; 
How the little spark is shining, 
From whoever can it be ? 
It get's brighter still and brighter, 
Like a 
little sunny ray, 
And I 
dare to guess the writer, 
For it drives suspense away. 
CTIORUS. 
Bright spark of hope, 
Shed your beams on me, 
And send a 
loving message 
From far across the sea. 
Hope and fear alike perplex me: 
Oh, superstitious dread, 
how many idle.fancios 
You conjure in my head ; 
When those we love are absent., 
How wantonly you play— 
Ev'ry shadow seems a 
substance, 
And drives suspense away. 
Bright spark of hope, etc. 
How gladly I 
remember, 
'Tis two short months—no more, 
Since a 
letter in the candle 
Shone out as bright before; 
Then the darling messenger 
Came prompt and safe to me; 
If this is only from the samco, 
How welcome it shall be. 
Bright spark of hope, etc.

On the Premen Steamship Line.

THE BOLD MILITIA MAN. 
BEHOLD a 
noble hero, 
Behold a 
man of might ; 
I 
never have a 
fear, no, 
For I 
never have to fight, 
And I 
hope I 
never shall have to, 
As it would not suit my plan. 
cnonus. 
Then shout hurrah, shout hurrah, 
For a 
bold militia man ; 
Then shout hurrah 
For a 
bold militia man; 
So shout hurrah for glorious war; 
I'm a 
bold militia man. 
My uniform so splendid 
Quite captivates the fair, 
Such grace and valor blended 
You don't find everywhere; 
But of all I 
like the servants, 
For from them I 
get the scran. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, the servants—for your humble servant they 
know how to reward my generous devotion to my country, and 
they do reward we with their masters' victuals ; and when 1 
recount to them the deeds of daring I 
have done, they— 
Shout hurrah, etc. 
I've been in sev'ral battles, 
Sham fights of course I 
mean, 
And where the powder rattles, 
Why there I'm never seen ; 
You may find me in the rear, 
But never in the van. 
SPOICEN.—All, I 
have seen some service-1 
have been in the 
battle of BriOton on Easter Monday, and a 
night attack at Al-
dershot at the end of a 
field day—I 
remember once in the midst 
of the fray we lost sight. of the enemy altogether, but presently 
we found them; ' twas in a 
public house ; the order was given 
to charge, an1 we charged them, and they charged us—in fact, 
overcharged us, sixpence a 
pot for fourpenny ale, but I 
beat 
them all at drinking it— 
So shout hurrah, etc. 
Of war I've such a 
notion, 
So all the soldiers say, 
That I'm sure to get promotion 
If with them long I 
stay ; 
I 
shall become a 
general, 
Or a 
corp'ral if I 
can. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, they say I 
shall soon become one of three—a 
corp'ral, a 
gen'ral, or a 
scoundral, and who knows but what one 
day it may he the latter ?— 
So shout hurrah, etc.

SWEET GENE 
VIEVB. 
Words by GEORG'S COOPER. 
liuSIC by lirsay Timm 
[HENRY TUCKER 
--Inn COMPOSER. 
Oar ?Wien will thank us for giving a 
slight sketch of one who has fin 
many years contributed to their pleasure by the medium of his exquisit I 
songs and ballads. Henry Tucker is a 
self made man in every respect. 
Us is a 
native of Cayuga Co., State of New York, a 
County, by the by, 
tv-aich has given birth to many remarkable men. At, an early age the 
subjtct of this sketch moveloped decided musical talents. 
His first 
3ong—" The Forest Queen,' 
appeared in 1842, after which came 
" 
Agnes May," and " Star of the Evening." 
All of these songs were 
successful, and then followed a 
delicious tide of pure and beautiful 
melodies, that culminated in that outbreak of a 
Nation's hopes and 
fears—the universally popular, " When this cruel war is over.' As far 
as popularity and simplicity and correctness of style are concerned, 
Henry Tucker stands to-day highest among our native composers. In 
character he is a 
kind, genial gentleman—the idol of his many friends. 
His name is a 
synonym ot all that is agreeable in social intercourse. 
In fact, Henry. Tucker —with story—is s 
popular saying in New York 
ci
rcles. 
His latest composition, ' Sweet Genevieve,' shows that his 
Lyre has not yet lost its wonderous charm. He is at present engaged 
in editing a 
series of popular Music for H. M. DeWitt. To use an 
Arabic expression, may Henry Tucker's " shadow never grow 'ess." 
but may the world still be charmed by his heart-moving melodie.s.1 ' 
O. Genevieve, I'd give the world, 
To live again the lovely past; 
The rose of youth was dew iinpearlq, 
But now it withers in the blast. 
I 
see thy face in every dream, 
My waking thoughts are full of thee; 
Thy glance is in the starry beam, 
That falls along the summer sea. 
0 GeneVieVe, sweet Genevieve, 
The days may come, the days may go; 
But still the bands of inem'ry weave, 
The blissful dream of long ago. 0, Genevieve 
Fair Genevieve, my early love, 
The years but make thee dearer far, 
My heart shall never, never rove. 
Thou art my only guiding star, 
For me the past has no regret, 
What e'er the years may bring to me, 
I 
bless the hour when first we met, 
The hour that gave me love and thee. 
0. Genevieve, & C. 
COMING HOME FROM THE BALL. 
Entered aer-erding to Act of Congress, in the year 1874, by E. H. 
HAIIDING, 
in the Office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington, D. C. 
The Music of this song is published by E. 
H. 
HARDING, 238 Bowery, New 
York. 
Price 10 cents. 
THERR is no place so gay as the ball- room, 
When we are dancing in dreamy delight, 
When the cares of the day never greet us 
In the flash of the beautiful night ; 
But the dawn puts an end to our glory, 
And the pleasures we dearly adore, 
We must part from the scene so enchanting, 
And go home looking sleepy and sore. 
Oh, it's all very well to be waltzing, 
And the pleasures we love to recall, 
But you know how you feel in the morning, 
Coming home, coming home from the ball. 
There the ladies are rivals of Venus, 
And their smiles all around us do bestow, 
Every face wears a 
mantle of gladness, 
There is welcome wherever we go; 
But when morn comes around, we are weary, 
And we growl at the pain in our heads, 
And we think we are foolish for dancing 
When we should have been home in our beds. 
Oh, it's all, eta. 
All around us the music is floating, 
Light and gay as the bird's happy song, 
And we sigh when the last note is over, 
Tho' we know we've been dancing too long; 
We are lost in the gladness around us, 
And we heed not the hours as they fly, 
Till the light peeping in through the window 
Makes us all bid each other good-bye. 
Oh, it's all, etc.

Who told me dat she'd love me to substraction— 
My darling leetle Mulkey deiteher belle.

But still I

hobo to be cut rite in two. 
CHORUS. 
lieu hair is red, but dat's not all, 
Yust like some vater it, does fall, 
In her hair she years a 
Russia turnip, 
Until a 
sweed potatoe in her vaterfall, 
And I 
love me dis darling bunch of carrots, 
Dis darling leetle dcitcher gal of all. 
De first dime I 
met dis leetle darling, 
'Dwas at a

Una I 
danced mit my darling Katharina, 
And pooty soon I 
gwick commenced to spark. 
dohl her dal I 
loy'd her, oh ! so muehly, 
I 
couldn't say more dan dat, 
And of she would love me yust a

She said dat she loy'd me very truly, 
Und of I

Till my master rapp'd my knuckles: 
On Sundays I'd trim my face to look grim,

And I, 'shamed of my sinning, 
Bit my lips to keep it down, 
But my eyes would still keep grinning!

And others with much money, 
But to see them on their knees, 
To my mind was quite too funny

'Its evening brings my heart to thee, 
When all is lovely, calm and still; 
That welcome hour so dear to me, 
When purest thoughts my bosom fill ! 
The bird flies homeward to its nest, 
The zephyr woos the wand'ring bee, 
The dewdrop seeks the lily's breast, 
So evening brings my heart to thee. 
CIIORITS . 
To thee! to thee! 
'Tis evening brings my heart to thee. 
A 
truant beam returns ao.ain 
To mingle with the orb of day; 
A 
streamlet, winding through the glen, 
Will lose itself in ocean spray ; 
And when the sky with beauty glows, 
And starry eyes look on the sea, 
When weary nature seeks repose, 
Then evening brings my heart to thee. 
To thee! to thee, et4. 
Oh ! I 
could linger at thy side, 
And dream away my every care; 
Or fancy life a 
silver tide, 
With not a 
wave to ripple there; 
Though fortune frown and coldly spurn, 
And mine a 
chequered path must be, 
Till mem'ry's lamp shall cease to burn, 
Will evening bring my heart to thee. 
To thee ! to thee, ete.

UPON the rustic bridge we met 
One afternoon in spring ; 
His loving words I 
can't forget, 
Within my ears they ring! 
The swans were sailing on the lake, 
And all the park was gay; 
My hand in his he chanced to take 
In such a 
charming way! 
The flowers were blight, but oh, his eyes 
They shone like stars of night; 
His smile was like the glowing skies, 
And filled me with delight; 
I 
seemed in love's delicious dream, 
My heart with rapture beat, 
And while his eyes did on me beam, 
I 
heard his lips repeat, 
" 
There is no harm in kissing; 
Pray tell me, is there, dear 7 
Those rosy lips invite me now, 
And no one lingers near 
Then loving ones are meeting— 
No prying eyes to mark— 
There is no harm in kissing 
At twilight in the park." 
We strolled along where roses grew, 
And all was bright and fair; 
He promised ever to be true, 
And begged my love to share. 
The little birds were flying home ; 
They heard my lips reply, 
And stars were bright in yonder dome 
Before we said good-bye.

THERE IS 140 HARM IN KISSING.—Concluded. 
But oh, he seemed so sad to leave— 
My heart grew sad as well, 
For love within each heart did weave 
Its dear bewitching spell ! 
We lingered though the hour was late. 
How quick the time had sped! 
But when our lips met at the gate, 
He softly to me said, 
".There is no harm in kissing; 
Pray tell me, is there, dear 1 
Those rosy lips invite me now, 
And no one lingers near! 
Then loving ones are meeting— 
No prying eyes to mark— 
There is no harm in kissing 
At twilight in the park."

LOST in the wide world, hopeless and weary ; 
Gone is the gladness that made life so dear! 
Dark is my pathway, lonesome and dreary ; 
No smile to cheer me is lingering near! 
Once bloom'd around me life's fairest roses ; 
Loved ones and fond ones now cheer me no more; 
Lost in the wide world, while calmly reposes 
Each heart that blest me in sweet days of yore. 
CHORUS. 
Lost in the wide world, while calmly reposes 
Each heart that blest me in sweet days of yore. 
Lost in the wide world, wand'ring in sadness, 
Dreaming of dear ones who left me in tears, 
Stars of the midnight whisper with gladness, 
41 Loved ones are waiting, then hush all tny fears I" 
Oh, how I 
miss them, life's lovely roses ! 
Sweet voices call rite to yon further shore I 
Lost in the wide world, while calmly reposes 
Each heart that blest me in sweet days of yore!

THE DUTCHMAN'S SLATE. 
Ata—" Enoch Arden." 
Kind friends, you was listen, I 
told a 
-tu one story 
What happened to me, here, one da: 
I 
keep of this city a 
lager-bier saloon, 
And I 
think of that business will pay. 
But my lager run out, and my Switzer-Kase, too, 
And I 
found out, when it has been too late, 
Of you want to make money in this kind of business, 
By dam! you Anust not keep a 
slate. 
My friend, Gasper Mintz, he called on me one day' 
And asked me for em n 
glass of bier: 
ne drink that, and said: It was bully 1 
anudder, 
And then rubs his belly—right here. 
He called for more lager, and Switzer-Kase, too; 
And then he said : That was first rate I 
When I 
ask him for pay, he do so—mit his eye, 
And told me : Put that on theslato. 
Now, I 
don't like that business : and so I 
was tfq.d 
One day, when be came mit my store, 
And there I 
saw Gasper a- drinking mine lager, 
And huggint my wife mit the door : 
I 
take him shust so, mit the slack of his. Lreeches, 
And pitch him right out on his head : 
I 
hike down that slate, and I 
break up that business, 
And den, ten tausend ! I 
was mad.

Und rubs out de accounts all, 
So I

But I

But I

Of schnapps or lager beer. 
CHORUS.

YOU ARE TOO SLEEBY. 
Written and sung by Gus Wn.nrAms. 
Tor may dink dot I'm grazy, or that I'm drunk, perhaps 
But since I 
vos a 
little boy, I've always had de gaps ;' 
Vot makes me feel so sleeby, I 
really cannot tell, 
I've been to fifdy doctors und dey cannot get me yell. 
SPOSEN.—Und all my friends say yen dey meet me— 
You are too sleeby; come, rouse ub, Jake, be vide avake, 
You are too sleeby; you set rue gaping too ; 
You are too sleeby; come rouse ub, Jake, be vide avake, 
Blease stop your yawning, you make me sleeby too. 
I 
vonce knew a 
young lady, und I 
did love her, too, 
Vone day I 
popped de gwestion, und said dot I'd be true; 
I 
said all sorts of funny dings, as she sat in my lap, 
Yen she got up and shook me just because I 
chanced to gap. 
SposEN.—She said she wanted a vide-avake husband, rind 
not vone dot her friends vould holler out at, und say,__ 
You are too sleeby, etc. 
No matter vero I'm working, no matter vot I 
do, 
I'm certain for to be discharged, in ' bout a 
day or two ; 
I 
set all hands a-gaping mid den dey vork so slow, 
be boss says dot it hurts his trade, und dells me for to go. 
SPOREN.—Und as I

Sung with iDimmise applause by TONY PANTOS.. 
A TINY, pretty boy was seen 
To climb his father's knee, 
And kiss his brawny cheek and say, 
"Now papa, you kiss me." 
The father pressed his darling child, 
And smoothed his silken hair, 
And Willie murmured with a 
sigh, 
"I wish mamma was here !" 
CHORUS. 
I 
wish mamma was here ! 
I 
wish mamma was here!" 
And Willie murmured with a 
sigh, 
" 
I 
wish mamma was here!" 
A 
tear rolled down the father's cheek, 
He pressed his pining boy, 
For her be loved had gone before, 
And Wfdlie's end was nigh; 
lie bore him to his little cot, 
And dried the falling tear, 
And Willie murmured in his sleep, 
" 
I 
wish mamma was here !" 
" 
I 
wish mamma," etc. 
His darling pined that very night, 
Until the turn of tide, 
The angel death was near him then, 
At early dawn he died. 
The father cried in wild despair,' 
" 
Oh ! live, my darling dear I" 
And Willie breathed his last fond sirrh., 
"

NEVER LOOK BEHIND. 
As sung by (its. WILLIAMS. 
How many folks repine at fate, 
And bow their heads to sorrow, 
I 
laugh when cares upon me wait, 
I 
know they'll leave to-morrow ; 
And easily through life I 
glide, 
'Tis always the best I 
find, 
To carry my troubles cheerfully, 
And never look behind. 
CHORUS. 
For what's the use of looking back, 
Or giving way to sorrow, 
The skies to-day that looks so black, 
May brighter be to-morrow. 
easy to drive dull care away, 
If you've the strength of mind; 
To carry your troubles cheerfully, 
And never look behind. 
In journeying 'long the road of Life, 
You'll surely meet with many 
A man who'll throw an X away, 
Because he's lost a 
penny, 
And wander from the beaten track, 
As if he felt inclined, 
`lso look for some new trouble, 
Which he might have left behind. 
For wha:'s the use 
lookhor back. 
Others, too, will try and make 
A fortune in a 
hurry, 
&lid if they don't succeed at once, 
Will fret and fume and worry. 
What can't be cured must be endured, 
Is a 
maxim old and true, 
Don't care for care, then rest assured, 
That care won't care for you. 
For what's the use of looking back, & c. 
In life at times we must expect 
To meet with things unpleasant, 
We can't recall the time that's past, 
But may improve the present. 
Deal fairly with your fellow man, 
To every one be kind, 
And hope for bright and better days, 
But never look behind, 
For what's the use of looking hack, 
Or giving way to sorrow, 
The skies to-day that look so black, 
May brighter be to-morrow, 
easy to drive dull care away, 
If you've the strength of mind, 
To carry your troubles cheerfully, 
And never look behind.

IA poor motherless boy was found stowed away on board of an

such cases, that " he had been put aboard by a 
relative," 
The mate, 
not believing the story, ancl suspecting some of the crew in the matter 
told the boy that he Iva two minutes to live, and advised hint to speak 
the truth, aud save his life. " Oh," said the little boy, " I've told all 
the truth, but let me pray before 1 
die."1 
Sad and weary, far from home, 
None to help or save him there; 
Pale as angry ocean's foam, 
Knelt the ragged boy in praye 
Gently bowed his noble head; 
Mother watched him from the 
These the only words he said; 
"Let me pray before I 
die." 
Pale and tearful all around, 
limbed the noise of breeze and wave, 
Cords are brought, his hands are bound 
All are silent as the grave. 
Mild blue eyes are raised in prayer, 
Death and parting bring no sigh ; 
Please one moment do but spare. 
" 
Let me pray before I 
die." 
Softened thus the sailor stood ; 
Lo 
he heeds that pleading form, 
Brave his heart, so hind and good, 
Brightly fell the tear drops warm. 
Swiftly he flew, as ocean birds, 
ThEre around the joyful cry, 
Kissel the lips that breathed the WOra 
"

THE SHAUGHRAITN . 
Words by GEO. Cooren. 
Am.—" Pat Molloy." 
THERE was a 
brave voting Irish lad, the pride of all the land, 
For dancing and for rattlin cr sport the chief of all the band ; 
The girls they smiled upon him, too, and sighed when he pasw 
ed by, 
And shyly glanced upon him from the corner of their eye! 
Unto his master, leal, and true he never swerved an inch, 
A noble friend he proved to be at each unlucky pinch ; 
lie followed him beyond the sea when tyrarny was rife, 
This darling boy would save him, and would shield him with 
his life ! 
CHORE'S. 
Am.—Chorus of " Regular Army, O." 
Then it's hip hurrah for Irish lads and dear old Ireland, too ; 
Their hearts are kind— you'll always find them generous and 
true ! 
For their native land they'll bravely fl -dit, and everywhere they 
(To 
They charm the girls, and boldly deal destruction to the foe. 
Am.—" Cruiskia Lawn." 
When the Slianohraun's master came 
To green Erin's land of fame, 
From the perils of prison so drear, 
The priest so good and kind 
Sheltered him where none could find, 
And tlui 
noble Irish lad was ever near. 
Then it's hip hurrah, etc. 
But when prison walls so cold 
Did his master's form enfold, 
To the rescue so nobly he sped; 
No bolts and bars can bind 
Those who fight for home, you'll find, 
And the hirelings found an empty ca-,e 
instead. 
Then it's hip hurrah, etc. 
AIR.—" Killarney." 
Love had won the Shauctrann's heart, 
Pierced it with a 
fatal dart ! 
From his oirl he ne'er could part 
Till the life within had flown ; 
Tier's the smile that shone afar 
Like the lovely morning star,

Never grief her beauty mar 
Till he claims her for his own ! 
Angels were not half so bright ; 
Oh, his dreams were sweet delight 
She his vision day and night, 
Pride of dear Killarney. 
Then it's hip hurrah, etc. 
AIR.--" Tim Finnezan's Wake." 
But when they all thought the Shaucidtraun dead, 
A handsome " waking" they gave to him, 
And they laid him upon a 
feather bed; 
There was Mickey and Pat and Ted and Tim! 
And the whiskey it flowed in the sweetest way, 
And the ructions and dancing at once began, 
And there wasn't one that knew that day 
That Conn was a 
real " live" Irishman. 
Then it's hip hurrah, etc. 
BIG RUBBER BUSTLE. 
Bar.jo Solo by ED. HARRIGAN. . 
I'LL sing of my girl, my lovely girl, 
She could play seven up and rounce, 
One fault she had, she had eyes like a 
shad, \ 
She couldn't set still but she'd bounce. 
I 
shall never forget the first time we met, 
With a 
wash- tab she was having a 
tussle, 
She fell on the ground and bounced out of town:, 
The gal with the big rubber bustle. 
I 
searched far and near till I 
found out my dear, 
She was stuck on the end of a 
steeple, 
High in the air she was hung by the hair, 
Makino snouts down at the people. 
A rope I 
soon found, fetched her to the ground, 
It used up a 
great deal of muscle ; 
To the preacher we sped, I 
was bound to wed, -' 
The gal wid the injun rubber bustle. 
When we got to the place she was red in the face, 
The preacher ses now den I'll tie her ; 
On her bustle she dropped, frough de skylight she popped 
Like a 
base ball de boys call a 
flyer. 
She lit on a 
cloud and went out of sight, 
To get into Leaven she'll tussle, 
She made a 
mile at a 
jump, at every thump 
ihe got on dat big rubber bustle,

THE LESS I SLY OF IT, THE BETTER. 
Writtirn and sung by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
Am.—" Its wonderful how we do it, but we do." 
Nsw soners will come around, 
As new subjects they abound, 
And the one I've got ; I 
think is just the cheese, too, 
And if it makes a 
hit, 
Why then, I 
don't care a 
bit, 
For my object is for to sing and to please you. 
It's a 
saying, by the way, 
That you hear every day, 
And sometimes you may read it in a 
letter ; 
So with n: more preface, 
I 
will introduce my case— 
For, I 
think the less I 
say of it, the better. 
A 
young man in the street, 
A 
pretty girl does meet, 
And introduces himself by sweet talking ; 
She thinks he is so nice, 
For he talks as smooth as ice 
To her, as along the street they're walking ; 
And not long after that, 
She's got on a 
new hat, 
And way up town we find that he has met her ; 
And when it does get dark, 
They walk into the park— 
Well, I 
think the less I 
say of it the better. 
I've been idle just a 
year, 
And I'm feeling rr_ther queer, 
As to where I'm going for to raise some money ; 
For it's true, upon my life, 
I've got a 
darling wife, 
And she can't live very long on love and Toney; 
But there's one thing so fine, 
We've no children so divine, 
So poverty it don't seem such a 
fetter. 
But on this you may rely, 
There will come some by- and-bye— 
Well, I 
think the less I 
say of it the better.

NEVER GO BACK ON THT1 BOYS. 
Now my wanderings are over 
I 
hope I 
am greeted by all, 
Then try and assist a 
poor brother, 
Let his offerings be ever so small ; 
Though some people and fortune may sever, 
And have not a 
dollar for toys, 
But then if I 
do live forever, 
I'll never go back on the boys. 
CHORI:JS. 
So here's we may never know sorrow, 
Tog,ether we'll share all our joys, 
I'll meet you again on the morrow, 
And I'll never go back on the boys. 
When a 
man has acquired wealth plenty 
To buy all this world in its joys, 
You'll find nineteen out of twenty 
Will turn their back on the boys ; 
They foraet that they once was lonely, 
And think of their troubles no more, 
They're down on a 
friend because only— 
This friend he chances to be poor. 
So here's we may never know sorrow, etc. 
I've trarplled this wide world over, 
The Srp'uth, the East, and the West, 
And at the end I 
discovered 
That here in the North was the best ; 
The peoilde up here can live quietly, 
And have all the world in its joys, 
That is if they only act rightly, 
And never go back on the boys. 
Suihere's we may never know soi row, etc. 
THE GALLOPPING HORSE ; 
OR, TERRY O'MULLIGAN. 
A broth of a 
boy— full of :mod humor and scientific knowledge. 
Written and composed by Far.Draio ALsccariE. 
my gallopping horse! 
Oh! my gallopping horse! 
I'm at home on the top of my gallopping horse ! 
And I 
never can meet 
With a 
tune half se sweet 
As that made by the feet 
Of 
my galloping horse; 
As 
there he goes prancing, 
And here he comes dancing, 
And rearing and tearing so proudly and strong, 
It is so delightful, 
And makes me feel quite full 
Of daring, don't caring, while rushing along 
On my gallopping horse, 
On my gr Hopping horse, 
I'm at home on the top of my gallopping horse; 
And I 
never can meet 
With a 
tune half so sweet 
As 
that made by the feet 
Of my gallopping horse. 
Oh 
my gallopping horse! 
Oh ! my gallopping horse! 
There was never his equal for mettle or force; 
He's a 
spirited racer 
And bold steeple-chaser, 
My far-leaping, high- lying, gallopping horse. 
He ooes smashing and crashing, 
And splashino and dashing, 
straight at a 
deep ditch, a 
rough fence, or high 
Not badly though madly, 
All obstacles gladly, 
That come in his way, he goes full at them all. 
Oh! my gallopping horse, etc. 
Now 
draw rein with reason, 
And just take my ease on 
The back of this wonderful gallopping horse ; 
And I'll own I 
was wrong 
When I 
put it so strong, 
That there wasn't his equal for mettle or force; 
(1) 
109 
TTTE GALLOPPiNG HORSE.—Continued. 
There is such another 
That makes as much bother 
In rearing and tearing as ever did mine ; 
That prances as gladly, 
Aid dances as madly, 
And who's thlis nag's owner you'll never divine. 
On his gallopping horse, etc. 
Each man's hobby, of eourse, 
Is his galloping horse ; 
He believes Giere's no steed of such mettle or force. 
_tid when he's astride 
Of his hobby, he'll ride 
Just as wildly as I 
do on rny hobby-horse; 
If you ever endeavor 
To stop him, you'll never 
Succeed in persuading him out of his course. 
He thinks he's so clever, 
No logic whatever 
Can reason h'in down from his own hobby- horse. 
That's his gallopping horse, 
That's my gallopping horse, 
That's yours; mine, and every man's gallopping horse ; 
And we never can meet 
With a 
tune half so sweet 
As that made by the feet of our own hobby- horse. 
BLOW GENTLY, WINDS, BLOW GENTLY. 
Written and composed by FP.EDELIC MACCABE, 
As I 
wander tilirough the fields where the sweet flowers are 
growing. 
Or down in the meadow where the streamiet is flowing, 
I 
sing that my love may come safe back to me— 
Blow oently, winds, blow oently, while my love is on the sea; 
For oh ! he is coming, coming back to me— 
Blow ,ently, winds, blow gently, while my love is on the sea. 
Though the sky is fair and calm above, in sunlight brightly 
And through the softly waving trees the mildest breeze is blow-
jug, 
Far. far upon the ocean, ah I 
what storms may there not be— 
Blow gently, winds, blow -ently, while my love is on the sea ; 
For oh I 
he is coming, 
back to me— 
Blow gently, winds, blow 1-:ently, while my love is on the see.

See, when the moonlight falls on the streamlet, 
Silvering each ripple with its brilliant rays, 
Out in the midnight making the heart light, 
Waking the " dickey birds'' before the break of day ; 
Tickling and teasing, kissing and squeezing, 
Telling lots of little fibs, and saying they are true ; 
Some say 'tis naughty, others very pleasing, 
Just wait a

Cao.—Wait till the moonlight, Sze. 
Homeward retreating, one sad heart beating, 
Now she must bid you the last good-night; 
She fondly wishes those stolen kisses 
Could last till to-morrow morning's broad daylight.

Carefully she raises the latch with her key ;

These were the last words of " Americus," the well-known child violinist, 
seven years of age, who expired very suddenly during the night of January 
10th, 1874, in Boston 
So quietly did his spirit take its flight, that his 
father, who occupied the same room, although hearing his son make the 
foregoing exclamation, thought the boy was talking in his sleep, and was 
horrified to had the little child, cold in death, in the morning.

DOLLY DOT. 
Sung by Gus W ILLIAMS-
I'm told that once there lived a 
maid, 
Whose name was Dolly Dot, 
And while her Pa soled boots and shoes, 
She sold potatoes, hot ; 
He never stirred from out his stall, 
But Dolly had to roam, 
For she repaired to 
Union Square 
While he repaired at home, 
Dol'y Dot was handsome, Dolly Dot was fair, 
Dolly Dot potatoes hot sold in Madison Square; 
Oh ! Dolly Dot was charming, Duly Dot was gay, 
And just the sort of a 
girl to steal a 
fellow's heart away, 
Now as she earned her daily bread 
'Tis said that it befel, 
She won the heart of one who came, 
His daily bread to sell ; 
So gay was he that in his coat 
A 
flour was always found, 
And be went round the Square because 
The Square was in his round. 
E-11 
Dolly Dot, & c. 
DOLLY DOT. 
10uNeLuDE.D. 
But Dolly had a 
black amour 
A chimney sweep so cute, 
And as she helped the black-a-moor., 
She looked upon his soot; 
An all persuading tongue had he 
And was such an adept, 
That all he cried was chimneys weep 
And then the chimneys wept. 
Dolly Dot, 4Le. 
These two heroes were bosom friends 
Until it came about, 
That they fell in with Dolly Dot 
And then they both fell out; 
Beside poor Dolly's can they met 
For her fair hand to fight, 
And soon they had the matter up 
And down in black and white. 
11411 
Dolly Dot, (tc., 
The baker soon began to tire, 
For dough is tender stuff, 
And when they'd a 
bout or two 
He'd had about enoug; 
Th3 lucky chimney sweep thus proved 
His right to Dolly's' charms, 
And soon his sweetheart flew unto 
Her love's victorious arms. 
Dolly Dot,

I

Oh wouldn't I

To marry the Russian Maria, 
I'd sail about the sea in ships, 
And set the Thames on fire.— Cite.

BECAUSE I am a 
countryman, 
And a 
stranger in the city, 
All sorts of tricks they play on me, 
And they think their actions witty; 
When I 
go out I 
turn about, 
And peculiar smiles I 
see; 
" 
Oh, ain't he fresh 1" I 
hear them shout, 
While they take long looks at me. 
SPOKEN.—I 
can't understand it at all. 
No matter where I 
go, 
I 
hear some personal remarks. 
I 
don't like personal remarks. 
They strike deep into my sensitive breast, and make me swear. 
I 
say, " Dew it, what does it mean?" and echo answers, " Dew 
it, what does it mean 1" 
The very day I 
arrived in this city I 
asked a 
man up at the Grand Central Depot if he knew where I 
could engage a 
nice furnished room. " Oh," says he " you're 
after furnished rooms, eh 
Well, sir, you're in the wrong 
neighborhood; you don't belong here. 
Well, sir, I 
suppose 
you'll kPep correct by following your nose !" 
I 
told him he 
was very impertinent. But as I 
walked away in silence and dis-
may, I 
heard the fellow say in a 
very peculiar way— 
Young fellah, you're too fresh, 
Young fellah, you're too fresh ; 
It strikes me very forcibly, 
Young fellow, you're too fresh. 
One day last week I 
took a 
car, 
And a 
stranger sat beside me, 
Who stole my watch and pocketbook, 
ThourTh to prove it he defied me ; 
I 
went and saw a 
man of law, 
And ben:oed his best advice ; 
" 
My friend," said be, " you're very fresh ; 
Why, you've just come otfthe ice." 
YOUNG FELLAH, YOU'RE TOO FRESH. 
Continued. 
SPOKEN.—I 
thought that a 
very strange expression for a 
m,Rn 
of law. 
I 
told him he must certainly be m:staken, for I 
had 
never been on ice in my life. " Oh, yes, you have," says he, 
" 
metaphorically speaking, you have, sir ; you have been on the 
ice of innocence; you have lived in an atmosphere of Arctic 
virtue, free from the burning influence of metropolitan wicked-
ness." 
lie wanted to convince me that I 
was an ice man, I 
sup-
pose. 
But as he could give me no satisfaction for the loss I 
sustained, I 
left him 1 
and as I 
came down stairs I 
beard him 
say— 
Young fellah, etc. 
I 
took my girl to Central Park, 
And while there I 
grew quite spoony ; 
I 
asked her if she'd marry me ; 
" 
Why," says she, " you must be loony ;" 
I 
told her no, it is not so, 
I 
assure you, I'm quite sane ; 
You know I 
love you very much— 
Oh, don't let me love in vain. 
SrolzEN.—She didn't seem to understand my feelings correct-
ly, although I 
poured out my love in strains worthy of a 
trou-
badour. 
All she would say was, " Oh, don't! please don't ! 
I 
want to go home ! please don't !" 
" 
Nay, home thou shalt not go 
Till reasons good I 
know 
Why thou NVilt not bestow 
Thy love on me, 
And fill with glee 
This breast now shadowed o'er by woe. 
By jingo! yes, the cause I'll know! 
Speak out I 
Oh, fairest creature speak! 
Tell me what secret bate thou hast ! 
The tale I 
hear may make me weak, 
And all my hopes and fancies blast, 
But I

must know, 
Wherefore thou slightest me." 
I 
began to get excited, so she thought she had better explain 
herself.

THIS IS WHAT I DID. 
Sung by JOHNNY THomesos. 
KIND friends, I'm glad to see you a- smiling all around; 
I 
think I 
can amuse you, for I 
feel so good and sound; 
Oh, at dancing I'm perfection to the music of the fid, 
And when day's work is done to have our fun 
This is what I 
did. (
Dance.) 
When I 
first came to the city I 
was stylish to the feet; 
The ladies all they are so tall and dress so very neat; 
I 
went into an auction store and for these shoes did bid, 
And when the man asked me for the cash, 
This is what I 
did. (Dance.) 
When I 
went to get married, my girl was straight and tall, 
And master's clothes they fitted me like paper on the wall ; 
The parson says to me, Young man, which girl are you to we 7 
When I 
answered the old preacher man, 
This is what I 
did. (Dgnee.)

'WHERE'S ROSANNA GONE.—NONCLUDED.] 
Of her dad I 
was afraid, 
He's a 
disagreeable tanner, 
And he's often promised faithful 
He'd dislocate my neck. 
atorti,s.—So I 
used to kiss Rosanna just behind the kitchen doo; 
But I 
ne'er shall squeedge, &e. 
Of an evening after tea, 
While her daddy blew his 'bacca, 
I'd seek my love Rosanna, 
And ask her to share my lot. 
But when he found it out, 
Oh my how he would whack her, 
While I'd jump over the garden-wall, 
As though I'd just been shot. 
Cho.—I 
shall never kiss my love, die. 
I'd kunped over the wall one night 
In search of sweet Rosanna, 
And though I 
gently whistled, 
My love did not appear; 
But my hair stood bolt upright, 
For out came her dad, the tanner, 
Oh! my teeth they rattled like dominoes, 
And my legs doubled up with fear. 
Spoken.— At the end of our interview I 
felt convinced that he 
understood what "tanning " 
was, and so did /. 
I 
also concluded 
Cho.—I 
shall never see my love, &a. 
Some say she's hid away 
By her cruel dad on purpose, 
To cure her of her love for me, 
Some say my love's no more. 
If she's defunct, then soon 
Shall they find my clay-cold corpus, 
And our ghosts shall come, and frighten her dad 
Behind the kitchen door. 
Cho.—I 
shall never kiss my love, &e.

SONG OF THE FARMER. 
I 
have cattle that feed in the valley, 
And herds that graze on the hill. 
And I 
pride in the fruits of my labor 
For, I'm lord of the land that I 
till. 
I 
have plow'd the rough hill and the meadow, 
- 
Till feeble with age and with toil, 
And I 
know before long that another 
Shall reap the new -fruits of the soil. 
For, the son that bath toil'd for me ever, 
And faithfully stood by my side, 
Bath a 
hand that shall gather the harvest, 
When his feeble old father hath died. 
And the daughter so kind to her mother 
hall share with him all I 
possess; 
For, I 
feel that they love me as father, 
And welcome my tender caress. 
There's my faithful, my trusting companion, 
My kind-hearted, dear loving wife, 
I 
have toiled for her comfort with pleasure; 
For, such was the pride of my life. 
And still in my manhood I 
love her, 
For her kind and affectionate care, 
And all that the eark can afford me, 
With her I 
most willingly share.

On, Molly, my darling, come over the sea; 
I'm waiting, yes, waiting, my darling, for thee; 
I've watched for your sweet rosy face every slay, 
The face that I 
left in the land far away. 
Molly, my darling, I'm longing for you— 
Urn eager to kiss thee so tender and true; 
I'm watching and waiting, I'm sighing in vain, 
To hold to my bosom dear Molly again. 
Molly, my darling, come over the sea;

I've watched for your sweet rosy face every day, 
The face that I

Oh, Molly, my darling, come over the sea, 
And bring with you, dearest, those charms unto me; 
Bring all that I 
cherished at home on our isle, 
And, jewel, remember that fond, loving smile. 
Molly, my darling, don't linger so long— 
Don't keep me in grief, but take heed to my song; 
I'm waiting, my colleen, I'm waiting for you, 
And sigh for a 
glance from your bright eyes of blue. 
Molly, my darling, etc, 
Oh, Molly, my darling, come over the sea, 
And leave your dear cot on that isle of the sea; 
The dear little shamrock and all leave behind, 
And come to a 
country where freedom you'll find. 
Molly, my darling, oh, do not delay, 
But take the next ship that is coming this way ; 
I'm waiting to welcome and comfort you here, 
And, Molly, I 
hope that you soon will be near.

DEIYI BOYS 
'Tut Inventive genius of Yankee juveniles has brought out a 
new toy. 
It consists of a 
tin box with a 
hole punched in the 
end, through which they draw a 
waxed thread, makinu most un-
earthly noises— some like bens, others like sick cats, and some 
perfectly demoniacal in sound. 
The citizens of Brookly, have 
been much annoyed by " leetle boys mit boxes." 
Our foreign 
correspondent from " over the river" sends us the following 
germanesque effusion. 
Der sebades a night vas vallin' down 
Ofer der roofs of Brooklyn town, 
Ten droo der shtreets you bear dear noise 
Of five, six hundred leetle boys 
Mit boxes. 
Dese boxes vet dey shteels, I 
know, 
Dev doesn't buy dem any how; 
Und round der shtreets dey goes in " rings," 
A-bullin' at dem cursed dings, 
Like hens!

Says I, " Mein Gott I 
cooks your goose"—

Dere vas no hens, not any ver&—

Den Himmel' I

If dey don't slitop mid all dose 
You bet 1

Ven now, you can't go any vare,

OIVE A MAN A CHANCE. 
rm tir'd of offering advice, 
So will the subject change, 
And try a 
song of different stamp. 
A title far from strange; 
So, while I 
strive to do my best, 
At rue pray take a 
glance, 
Just lend your sympathizing ears, 
And give a 
man a 
chano:.. 
So always, boys, act fair and square. 
Accept what fortune grants, 
And don't be over critical, 
But give a 
man a 
chance. 
It's anything but proper, 
On a 
couple to intrude. 
To spoil a 
fellow making love, 
is very, very rude ; 
Don't interrupt their tete-a-tete, 
By making an advance, 
But walk a 
mile another way, 
And give a 
man a 
chance. 
Se always, boys, 
Suppose a 
fellow can't stump up 
Twenty shillings in the pound, 
Perhaps if breathing time be given, 
The needful will be found; 
Sa2,- to him, " Well, ill wait a 
bit," 
Think of this circumstance; 
And if you don't press over hard, 
You give a 
man a 
chance. 
So always, boys, etc. 
My song perhaps, may not please you. 
But to do so is my aim; 
To meet your hind approval is 
The summit of my fame; 
But if you do not quite agree 
With what I 
now advance, 
Just be as lenient as you can, 
And give a

I'M A TIMID, IDERVOUS MAN. 
I 
always was a 
timid man, 
And nervous from my birth, 
And nervousness I 
think is worse 
Than anything on earth ; 
For go to do what'er you will, 
You're sure to do it wrong. 
I 
hope it won't attack me now, 
And spoil me in my song. 
So if you will attentive be, 
I'll do the best 1 
can, 
To tell to you the sorrows of 
CetnirS.--- 
I'm nervous, I'm nervous, 
A 
timid nervous man. 
I'm nervous, I'm nervous, 
A 
timid nervous man. 
I 
met a 
most delightful girl, 
Out at a 
ball one night. 
I 
felt my peace of mind was gone, 
When first she came in sight ; 
I 
wanted to be introduced, 
And Brown soon did the job, 
By saying " Miss Jernima Green, 
My friend young Richard Cobb." 
I 
said " a 
lovely morning, 
No ? no, I 
don't mean that, 
It's night of course, I'm quite aware, 
But have you seen the cat ? [rm nervous, & c. 
No doubt she thought it very strange, 
That I 
should talk sueh stuff, 
And as I 
stood, I 
felt that she, 
Must think me quite a 
muff: 
I 
did not mend the matter much, 
When I 
turned round to say, 
" 
There's been a 
deal of weather, Miss, 
About the town to- day ;" 
And having made that sage remark, 
I 
sat down in a 
chair, 
Plump into Mrs. Johnson's lap, 
Whom I 
did not see there. [ I'm nervous, & c..] 
"I beg a 
thousand pardons" now 
I 
said to Mrs. J. 
Who only muttered some such word, 
As " fool" and turn'd iiwav ; 
I 
felt sui flurried and contused, 
I 
turned too quieldv round, 
I'M A TIMID NERIT017S MAIk7 (CONCLUDED) 
And nearly knock'd a 
fat old dame, 
Headlong upon the ground ; 
I 
bow d 
and hoped she was not hurt, 
But what was my dismay, 
To find the waiter stood behind, 
And I'd upset his tray. 
Pm nervous, 4.c. 
I 
said " Miss Green will you oblige 
Me with the next Quadrille ? 
As Waltzes— Polkas, I 
can't do, 
They always niake me ill." 
But lor I 
I 
could not & ilea at all, 
They pull'd me here and there, 
My foot caught in Jemima's dress, 
And that began to tear ; 
The trimming twisted round my legs, 
In such an awful way, 
flat half a 
dozen soon went down, 
And I 
among them lay. 
I'm nervous, & e, 
I 
rush a 
down stairs to leave the house, 
A hat and coat I 
took, 
ittnd not ' till I 
was nearly home, 
Did I 
once at them look : 
But who can tell the shock I 
felt, 
When on the hat I 
found, 
A servant's black cockade was there, 
And gold lace band till round; 
The coat was green and trimm'd with red 
And liv'ry buttons bright, 
In fact it was the servant's coat 
And hat I 
took that night. 
I'm nerveus, & o. 
I 
took them back and got 173 y 
own, 
And ' ere I 
left the door, 
There came frcim out the drawing room, 
Of laughter quite a 
roar ; 
They put me down as " fool" of course, 
And dear Miss Green, no doubt, 
Thought me the greatest " spoon" that she 
had ever met when out ; 
I 
lost the girl I 
doat upon, 
And made myself a 
fool, 
Because my nerves won't let me keep, 
Colket.; ,1, calm, and cool. 
I'm nervcus,

BE ALWAYS UP AND DOING, 
BOYS. 
As sung by Gus WILLtems.

mont street, Boston, Mass. 
Price 85 cents. 
LIFE and its cares are a 
burthon 
To those who hug cloFely the load ; 
Stout hearts must shoulder the knapsack, 
Arid never look back on the road. 
Steer your course with care and caution, 
The deep river noiselessly rolls ; 
To have health on your side is a 
blessing, 
The greatest that Dame Fortune doles. 
CHORUS. 
Let's be up and doing, boys, 
Always up and doing ; 
" 
Forget, forgive," your motto be, 
Always up and doing. 
Unfurl the old banner of duty, 
Advance at the word of command ; 
To help on the faint heart be ready, 
And by a 
true friend ever stand. 
Esteem not a 
man for his learning, 
Throw Tory and Whig overboard ; 
For work is the true stamp of merit, 
Be your man peasant or lord. 
Let's be up and doing, etc. 
Then fear not when old age steals over 
The work you've so happily done ; 
'Tis only by those who will labor, 
The battles of life may be won. 
Then waste not your days in repining, 
'Tis useless regretting the past ; 
But always be up and be doing, 
To honor feud duty hold fast,. 
Then let's be Up and 1

SONG OF THE SEXTON. 
Oh, the sights that I 
see as I 
ply my lone trade, 
In the moldering dust that a 
cent'ry bath made, 
Where the coffin worm cloth creep. 
I 
began long ago, when my life was still green 
And my mattock and spade have been active, I 
ween, 
To fashion the grave so deep. 
Ho! I 
laugh as I 
dig, for they all seek my aid, 
To provide them a 
home with my mattock and spade. 
The rich man bath pass'd me with towering head. 
But I 
sang o'er his grave when the scorner was dead, 
And laugh'd as I 
shoveled the mold. 
The hungry and wretched ne'er entered his door, 
his heart never bled for the wrongs of the poor, 
For the proud man well loved his gold. 
Ho! I 
laugh'd as I 
dug, fcir they wanted my aid, 
To provide him a 
home with my mattock and spade. 
I 
saw a 
young man in the fresh bloom of life, 
As he came to the church with a 
trembling young wife, 
Lift against me the finger of scorn. 
Oh, the revel was joyous, the dance lasted long, 
But the shriek of the widow soon banished the song— 
The young man died ere the morn. 
Ho 1 
I 
laugh'd as I 
dug, when they came for my aid, 
To provide him a 
home with my mattock and spade. 
I 
saw a 
fair child bend her beautiful head, 
And cull the lone flowers that bloom o'er the dead, 
To form a 
pure simple wreath. 
The crimson of hectic suffused her pale face ; 
In her eyes fearful lustre I 
trembled to trace 
'The herald of early death 
But I 
prayed that ere then, the deep home I 
have made, 
May close over me. and my mattock and spade.

York. 
Price 10 cents. 
Words and Music by J. P. S ELL. 
I 
AM a 
swell of the day as you see— 
All other swells are but models of me; 
You must have beard of the name which I 
bear., 
Surely yon must for I'm known ev'rywhere; 
Girls are enchanted when I 
am in view, 
Oents are bewildered and gaze at me too; 
Some criticise me and stare while they say, 
" 
Oh ain't he nobby, that swell of the day !" 
CHORUS . 
I 
am the swell of the day— 
That' s 
what the people all say ; 
Go where I 
will they say to me still, 
He's a 
genuine swell of the day. 
Now I 
confess I'm a 
little low down; 
How can I 
help it when all thro' the town 
People are praying for times to improve 1 
Still I'm contented and keep on the move— 
Why should I 
grumble when care I 
have none 1 
All my delight is in fashion and fun, 
Friends crowd around me, and wine makes us gay, 
Then they all flatter the swell of the day. 
I 
am the swell of the day, eta. 
I 
am accomplished and very refined; 
Once I 
was rich, but my purse has declined; 
Love is a 
stranger as yet to my heart, 
But from the ladies I 
ne'er can depart, 
They are the cause of my joy and despair; 
None can resist them, so charming and fair; 
Some spoony fellows they drive to dismay, 
Itit the/ all elitig to the swell of the day. 
I 
am the swell of the day, etc.

FIFTY MILES UNDER T RP SEA. 
As sung by Gus W ILLI.L.ms. 
The Music of this song is published by WmIT and GCM LLAUD, SG Tr. 
mont street, Boston, Maas. 
Price 35 cents. 
THE other night I 
went to bti, 
In fact I 
often do ; 
And in my sleep went down to the deep, 
Where a 
strange world met my view. 
This world was called Concordia, 
Its people gay and free; 
I 
wished that I 
was one of them, 
Fifty miles under the sea.

This is what I

food, and drink was pure and not 
Adulterated stuff; 
They'd no " Good Templars," for they knew 
When they'd just had enough. 
They'd no " blues " partial to " running in,'' 
No Divorce Court had they got ; 
And they'd never read the " Englishman," 
0 they were a 
happy lot. 
CHORL'S. 
This is what I

FIFTY leITT.TIS UNDER THE SEA.—Concluded. 
They'd never had a 
National debt, 
They never were troubled with war 
They never had a 
man for the rates 
Come " knock, knock, knock," at their doors. 
The toothache income tax and corns 
They knew not—happy souls! 
Of railroad smashes they'd ne'er heard 
Nor the price of a 
ton of coal. 
CHORUS. 
This is what I 
saw when dreaming, 
As plain as plain could be ; 
You may doubt my tale, they'd no workhoust, 
nor jail, 
Fifty miles under the sea. 
Never a 
one had been known to dread 
The approach of quarter day, 
The mothers-indaw all lived by themselves 
Ten thousand miles away. 
No " pater " was troubled with " milliner's '• bilis, 
Their children ne'er numbered a 
score ; 
You may think it strange, it was wisely arranged 
That each should have two and no more. 
This is what I 
saw when dreaming, 
As plain as plain could be ; 
I 
then heard a 
knock, " aFid it's past ten o'clock," 
I 
came up then from under the sea.

FIVE 0 CLOCK IN TILE MORNING 
Words and Music by Ct.taussz.. 
The dew lay glittering o'er the grass, 
A mist lay over the brook, 
At the earliest beam of the golden sun, 
The swallow her nest forsook. 
The snowy blooms of the hawthorn tree, 
Lay thickly the ground adorning, 
The birds were singing in every bush 
At five o'clock in the morning. 
The birds were singing in every bush 
At five o'clock in the morning. 
And Bessie, the milkmaid, merrily sang, 
For meadows were fresh and fair. 
The breeze of the morning Essed her brow, 
And played with her nut-brown hair, 
But oft she turned and looked around, 
As If the silence Booming; 
'Twas time for the mower to whet his scythe, 
At five o'clock in the morning, 
'Twits time for the mower to whet his scythe, 
At five o'clock in the morning. 
And over the meadow the mowers cans, 
And merry their voices raug, 
And one among them wended his way, 
To where the milkmaid sang. 
And as he lingered by her side, 
Daspite his comrade's warning, 
The old, old story SrliS told ags'is, 
At five o'clock in the morning. 
The old, old story was told again., 
At five e'clook in the morning,

MY BEAUTIFUL LOUISA. 
I HOPE you'll sympatise mit me, I'm a 
miserable man, 
Und if you'll listen to my song, I'll tell you if I 
can ; 
Dere reason is I've lost my girl, from me she has departed, 
She runned away mit a 
Dutch musician und left me proken-
hearted. 
C1101111S. 
My beautiful Louisa, her breath smelt like limburger cheese, 
She had a 
big mouth to eat sourkrout, und came from Fader-
land; 
But now she has departed, und left me proken-hearted, 
She runned away mit a 
leader of dot leedle German band. 
My Louisa she was beautiful, her nose was largo und flat, 
Besides she had but vone eye, und she used to squint mit dat; 
To a 
bier saloon I 
dook her von night, vich caused me all dis 
pain, 
For dot Dutch musician winked at Louise, und she winked bark 
again. 
My beautiful Louisa, etc. 
Yen his band stopped playing music, by my gal he took a 
seat, 
She called out for swi lager bier, uncl said dat him she would 
treat; 
I 
said dat dat's played oud, Louise, I'm a 
flat do you subbosel 
Yen dat Dutchman dook a 
lager bier glass, und broke it on my 
nose. 
My beautiful Louisa, etc. 
I 
got me so excited, dat I 
knocked him off his feed, 
Of course de waiters dook his part, and chucked me in de street; 
Dat night she runned away mit him, got marrid, doo, no doubt, 
if ever I 
cotched dot Dutch musician, ill kick my own brains 
oud. 
My beautiful Louisa, etc.

LIUNDRED YEARS AGO.—[CoNcLuDED.1 
The gay and giddy crowd, 
Which every day we view, 
Both old and young have passions strong 
As those our grandsires knew ; 
In friendship and in truth, 
You'll find ' twas ever so, 
For fools believed, and knaves deceived, 
A hundred years ago. 
A 
hundred years ago, 
A 
hundred years ago, 
For fools believed, and knaves deceived, 
A 
hundred years ago. 
Let heroes talk of war, 
In ages passed away, 
The laurels won were proudly borne, 
As those they win to-day ; 
What though our valiant arms 
Lay prostrate every foe, 
The men of old were quite as bold, 
A hundred years ago. 
A hundred years ago, 
A 
hundred years ago, 
The men of old were quite as bold, 
A 
hundred years ago. 
Then since 'twas ever 
Let pleasure be the theme, 
The song entwine with wit and wine, 
And women reign supreme; 
Why (rather life's dark flowers, 
When bright ones around must grow 
It was the same what e'er you name, 
A 
hundred years ago. 
A hundred sears ago, 
A 
hundred years ago. 
It was the same what e'er you name, 
A 
hundred years ago.

I 
sent thee late a 
rosy wreath, 
Not so much bon'ring thee, 
As giving it a 
hope, that there 
It would not withered be. 
But thou thereon didst only breathe, 
And sent it back to me; 
Since then it grows and smells, I 
swear, 
Not of itself— but thee !

BONNIE DUNDEE. 
Sir Walter Scott's Famous Ballad, sung by MRS. HOWARD PAM. 
To the lairds of Convention 'twas Claverhouse spoke, 
Ere the king's crown shall fa' there are crowns to be broke. 
To each cavalier who loves honor and me, 
Let him follow the bonnets of bonnie Dundee. 
CHORUS. 
Come fill up my cup, come fill up my can, 
Come saddin my horses and call out my men; 
Unlock the west port and let us go free, 
For it's up with the bonnets of bonnie Dundee! 
Dundee he is mounted, be rides up the street, 
The bells are rung b 
ielrurards, the drums they are beat; 
But the provost douce mon, said 
just e'en let him be, 
For the town is weel rid o' that dell o' Dundee!" 
Come fill up my cup, eze. 
There are hills beyond Pentland and lands beyond Forth, 
If ye've lairds in the South there are Chiefs in the North, 
There are brave Dhuinee vassals, three thousand times threet, 
Will cry hey I 
for the bonnets of bonnie Dundee! 
Come fill up my cup, dx. 
Then awa' to the hills, to the lea, to the rocks, 
Ere I 
own a 
usurper I'll couch with the fox; 
Aml tremble fause Iniox in the midst o' your glee, 
For ye've no seen the last o' my bonnets and me. 
Conic fill tip, 46. 
ALWAYS ON THE MOVE. 
CURE SONG. 
I 
feel so queer, just listen here, 
I'll tell you a 
queer story : 
My feet they bounce, my arms they flounce, 
I 
feel so Hunkey Dore-e. 
Ain't it strange, some take such pains, 
To be so calm, jnst as a 
dove, 
While I. if in the street or lanes 
Seem always on the move. 
I've got no ma'am, I 
ye got no'dad, 
I'd jump way off to glory, 
I 
am a 
jumping lively lad, 
I 
feel so flunkey Doree. 
My milma she died of Chicken Pox, 
Ma says my dad he died in love, 
They've left me here gay as a 
fox, 
And I'm always on the move. 
Good evening, folks, we've come to sing a 
little song, 
And tell you about that gal who dresses so gay, 
In Central Park I 
seen this dashing little queen, 
They say she is the beauty of Broadway. 
CHORUS. 
Should like an introduction to, that pretty gal dressed 
blue, 
And they say her name is Susina May, 
Oh, how my heart does beat, as I 
trip along the street, [Repeal. 
With this pretty little beauty of Broadway. 
Her pretty coal black eyes, like stars are in the akies, 
They stol'd this darkey's gizzard right away; 
I 
followed her a 
mile, to get a 
pleasant smile, 
From that pretty little beauty of Broadway. 
Should like, eze. 
I'm going to give a 
ball and invite the darkies all, 
And extend aninvitation to Miss May; 
And then \ ° till have a 
chance to join in the dance, 
With the pretty little beauly of Broadway. 
Should like, & tzt 
met her in the valley, where the daisies grow, 
I 
felt that T 
must love her, yes, if he would or no; 
It was a 
happy day, full well, full well, I 
know, 
I 
met her in the valley where the daisies grow. 
She was fair to me, as fair as fair can be, 
SO damsel yet was half so fair as she; 
She vowed that shed be true to me 
Down in -the valley where the daisies grow, 
The daigies -ohl the daisies oh, 
Down in the valley where the daisies grow; 
it was a 
-happy day, full well I 
know, 
Down in the valley where the daisies grow. 
I 
woo'd her 1n the valley where the daisies grow, 
And where beside -a 
streamlet the water-lilies blow; 
It was a 
happy moment when first she let me know 
he loy'd mein the valley where the daisies grow, 
'twas ajoy to The, -my heart was full-of glee. 
When she agreed my loving bride to 'be, 
And vow`d that she'd be true to me, 
'Down in the valley where the daisies grow. 
'The daisies oh the daisies ohl 
Down in the valley where the daisies grow; 
it was a 
happy day, full well I 
know, 
Down in the valley where the daisies grow.
