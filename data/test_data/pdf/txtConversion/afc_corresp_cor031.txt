Dear Dr. Corse:
It is gratifying to know that the records made by Prof. Alton Morris are on their way to us.
The indispensable list and notes, too, will be most welcome. Dr. Spivacke will give your
letter his personal attention as soon as he returns to the office.
Sincerely yours, Edward N. Waters Acting-Chief, Division of Music
