Day 19. Saturdgy. September 23. 1978: I spent the morning 
logging slides and fiddling around with my cassette tape-recorder, 
which has developed an annoying squeal that records on tape right 
along with the sound you want. .Around 2 PM the Eilers and I 
drove off towards the east; our intention was to visit the Keiths 
this morning, but since they were supposed to be haying today, and 
it has been raining, we're not sure vihat will happen. We drove 
E on 58 to Laurel Fork, then S on 638 and then E on 645 to the farm 
of a family named Kimball or Kimble, whose first names I never heard. 
The Eilers set up this session with the Kimble's, who were making 
sorghum molasses; I took quite a few pictures (BR8-TA-32 through 
BR8-TA-33; 14-20544; 6-20544) as did the Eilers. Then vie drove on 
into Floyd Co., and visited for a while with D.J. and Janet Keith. 
We set up an interview session for tomorrow, beginning somewhere 
around 2;00 PM. Mrs. Keith showed us some family photo albums, 
which the Eilers intend to copy tomorrow, and loaned me four cassete 
tapes of her father's string band, the Korn Kutters, as well as some 
of other family members singing and playing music. I will copy 
these onto reels on a Nagra tonight. After spending most of the 
afternoon and early evening doing this, We returned and I stayed up 
till all hours doing the dubs. BR6-TA-B13 through R18. 
Day 20. Sunday. September 24. 1978: Today began with more dubbing 
of the same cassettes, which must be done so that they can be re¬ 
turned to the Keiths today. Evidently the Sony cassette recorder I 
was using (#53214) was not recording properly at all, and so I had to
