PREFACE. 
order to keep my friends fully " up to the times" 
knowledge of the very best songs now popular, I 
arranged this song book. 
It is not crowded with a 
mass of pieces that few can sing, and that fewer will ever 
want to sing; but it is a 
painstaking collection of all the 
choice songs of the day— songs that every vocalist must 
wish to know; songs that become favorites the iloinent 
they are beard. 
Interspersed with the best pieces of our 
leading singers will be found many of my own specialties 
—songs that I 
am justly proud to say are never sung by 
me without winning hearty encores from that generous 
public which has always so kindly appreciated and liber-
ally rewarded my efforts to please. 
Most thankful for past, and hopeful for future, favors, 
I 
am the Public's most obediently, 
Rosca. 
PAT DELANEY. 
PARODY ON FTLTY RN ALLAIN
TNA. 
AS 
sang by JOLINNY ELAM. 
Mu name is Pat Delaney, I 
came across the sea, 
I 
live in a 
great big tenement house way up in Avenue C; 
A family they live next to me, they kick up a 
terrible 
roar 
About their Eileen Allanna, and their Angus Astore ; 
First the eldest b ; cy and then his youngest brother, 
They all join in the chorus with their sister and their mo-
ther ; 
When I 
get home at night, my boys, I 
hear this terrible 
roar 
About their Eileen Allanna and their Aug-us Astore. 
CHORUS. 
Working hard all clay, I 
think it is too bad, 
Climbing a 
forty-foot ladder, carrying a 
great big hod, 
When I 
get home at night, my boys, I 
hear this terri-
ble roar 
About their Eileen Allanna and their Augus Astore. 
Early in the morning before I 
do get up, 
Before I 
eat a 
mouthful, before I 
drink a 
sup, 
I 
hear them in the hallway and then they commence to 
roar 
About their Eileen Allanna and their Angus Astore ; 
If I'd influence in the ward in which I 
do belong, 
I'd go and see the judge and have him push this case 
quite strong, 
I'd have them all arrested, and that would stop their roar 
About their Eileen Allanna and their Augus Astore. 
Working hard all day, etc,

LIST night I 
was out rather late— 
'Twas only an innocent spree— 
My wife for my coming did wait, 
When sleeping I 
thought she would be; 
found her in temper and tears; 
Oh I 
she cried, it's a 
sin and a 
shame— 
And she scratched both my eyes and my ears, 
But I 
told her -
I 
soon would explain. 
CHORUS. 
The " Club" had a 
meeting, to-night, love, 
Of bus'ness we had a 
great sight, love ; 
Don't think for a 
moment I'm tight, by., 
I've only been down to the Club. 
My boots I 
left down in the hall, 
And softly I 
crept up the stairs; 
I 
kept rather close to the wall, 
And thought to ascend unawares; 
But just as I 
got to the door, 
I 
seemed to get lost .in the dark; 
I 
stumbled and fell on the door, 
And just then 1 
could only remark— 
The " Club" had, etc. 
;She sobbed and she wept and she screamed, 
And said she'd go back to her ma; 
'While I 
on the mantel- piece leaned, 
And tried to enjoy my cigar. 
I 
pronalse.d to buy her a 
dress 
If she'd let me alone for awhile-, 
Then I 
ga.ve her a 
sweet little kiss, 
And I 
saw her beginniug to smile. 
S7GKEN.—So 
I 
thought it a favorable opportunity to assure 
her once more, as apositive fact, that— 
The " Club" had, .eto.

To prepare us a 
dwelling place there.

In the sweet by-and-by 
We shall meet on that beautiful shore,

We shall sing on that beautiful shore 
The melodious songs of the blest, 
And our spirits shall sorrow no more--
Not a 
sigh for the blessing of rest. 
CHORUS. 
In the sweet by-and-by 
We shall meet on that beautiful shom, 
In the sweet by-and-by

For the glorious gift of his love, 
And the blessings that hallow our clays.

Come from wickedness and sin; 
Let the devil be deserted, 
Come and join the band within; 
Hear us preach, and hear us pray, 
Join us in each happy lay; 
While you're loose and led astray, 
Come and join the band.

Come, come, every Yankee, 
Every sinner thro' the land; 
Pray with Moody, sing with Sankey, 
Come, come, and join the band. 
Now the glory flows around us, 
Angels blow their bugles loud; 
Sinners bless the day they found us, 
See them creeping through the crowd; 
All the world we've come to heal— 
Into every breast we steal, 
We are for the nation's weal, 
Come and join the band. 
Come, come, etc. 
We have crossed the mighty ocean, 
Now we're back, with glory crown'd ; 
We have gained the world's devotion, 
Such a 
wicked lot we found; 
From the aged and the wise, 
Sever'd from their sinful ties, 
We have heard repenting cries, 
When they joined the band. 
Come, come, etc.

ET GOES AGAINST THE GRAIN.—[CoNetznan.1 
2. A 
young man courts a 
pretty girl, 
And fancies she adores him; 
But when he thinks the game is won, 
With some one else away she'll run; 
Of course, he'll -swear he doesn't care, 
Although it nearly floors him, 
And all the while he seems to smile, 
It goes against the grain. 
Cho.—Hell fit the cap, &c. 
S. Old maids, who don't deny their age 
Is something over thirty, 
May say they hate the sight of men, 
But still we find them now and then, 
At half a 
chance return a 
glance, 
And some get gay and flirty; 
'Which shows, if they still single stay, 
It goes against the grain. 
Cho.—They fit the cap, &c. 
4. The vile garotters, when they're caught, 
And that is none too often, 
Are now rewarded with the cat, 
They very much object to that, 
And if some say its not the way, 
Their brutal hearts to soften, 
It makes them yell, so we can tell 
It goes against the grain. 
Cho.—But they fie the cap, &A. 
S. Since Nelson's day upon the sea, 
W.e've changed our style of fighting; . 
Still the brave blue jacket lads, 
Cooped inside the ironclads, 
Are just as game, and true of aim, 
When wrongs require a 
righting; 
As every foe must know, although 
It goes against the grain. 
Cho.—But they fit the cap, Sio.

Wic march'd bfihind the Branigan's Band on the great klt. Pat-
rick's Day, 
With fifes and drums a- playing martial airs. 
From Ulster, Munster, Connainara, you see we are on hand, 
To march with the music to the tune of the Branigan's Band; 
Oh ! we march so gayly down the street, 
And ev'ry one we meet says, don't they step it neat! 
We smile on all the girls we meet, 
While marching down behind the famous Branigan's Band. 
CHORIJA. 
Mark time, keep step, forward, march away! 
With eyes out, toes in, march in grand array! 
Shoulder arms, with head erect, together hand in hand, 
Like heroes bold the young and old wil) march with the Brani-
gan's Band. 
The chambermaids in the big hotels, they raise the windeys 
high, 
F.or handkerchiefs they're waving towels to catch our soldiers' 
eyes ; 
They've left their hash to come out and mash when the mar-
shal gives command ; 
Then we all raise our hats to the tune of the Branigan's Band; 
Oh ! don't their hearts go pit- a-pat, 
As each one lifts his hat, the lean as well as fat, 
Says, there's my Dan, there goes my Pat, 
He's the Daisy swell that's with the famous Ersnigan's Band. 
Mark time, etc. 
Oh, we had a 
ball in Emerald Hall, and an illegant clipper, too; 
There was beans and peas and frigazees, and oysters fat for you, 
With pickled stews, and hullaboloK and Irish quail so g.I•and ; 
Beets, and cheese, and some potheen for the boys of the Brani-
gan's Band. 
Oh! it's then we sung, and danc'd a 
reel, 
And oh! how good we feel, we make the ladies squeal, 
So when morning comes it's home we steal,' 
With the boys all drunk as lords, with the Branigan's Band. 
Mark time, etc. 
. THE HEN CONVENTION. 
A famous Hen Convention 
Was held in Humbug Green— 
Such a 
s'..ow of fuss and feathers 
Ne'er before was seen, 
With Malays, Bantams, Chitagongs, 
And game- Fowls, fine and tall; 
But Mr. Rooster Shanghai 
Cut the biggest swell of alL 
It was cackle, cackle, cackle, cackloo 
Flap your wings and crow; 
And Shanghai shanged the highest 
At the Hen Convention Show, 
Says Malay, pulling out his gills, 
"I'm the fairest fowl," 
Says Bantam, " You're a 
ben-pick'd race—. 
lien-hearted, with no soul." 
Says SI:1E1110mi, ‘• Your poor Bantatns 
Are a 
race of chicken toys," 
Says Bantam, " If you peck at me, 
You'll and I'm one of the boys." 
It was cackle, 41m. 
A 
poultry duel .came on straight— 
'Twas Bantam and Shanghai ; 
A 
crow at first, and then a 
clip. 
And then the feathers fly. 
Young Bantam spurred him flat, 
Amid a 
loud convention crow; 
And Shang,hai slanged the lowest' 
At the great Convention Show; 
It was cackle, ito.

O'HALLERAN, 
THE BRAVE POLICBMAN. 
A new and original song, written and sung by W ILLIAM SCANLAN', in his 
new and original sketch, entitled, 4- 
Wanted, a 
Lodger; Or, 
The Life of a 
Mulberry Street Policeman," 
MY 
name is O'Halleran, and from Ireland I 
came, 
And since I 
came here I've gained great fame; 
The captains and aldermen all know me well, 
And my heroism and bravery they can easily tell.; 
If at night on my beat as I 
walk to and fro, 
The blackguards they see me, arrah, from me they'll go, 
To an alleyway or bar-room they'll run if they can, 
For they all know well I'm a 
brave policeman. 
CHORUS. 
For as I 
promenade my beat at night through the street 
I'm admired by every young lady I 
meet; 
t
,to• 
You'll hear them all sigh as hard as they can, 
For they're all deep in love with this brave policeman. 
When I 
first came from Ireland I 
was rather green, of course, 
But I 
very soon got smart when I 
went on the force; 
'Twas then I 
plucked up, and my courage did show, 
And was greeted no matter where'er I 
did go; 
As we led the parade on Saint Patrick's day, 
You can bet we looked grand as we all marched away; 
My countrymen would shout " Hurrah for 0 
Halleran, 
He's the pet of the force, and a 
brave policeman." 
For as Ipromenade, etc. 
I 
was very soon promoted to a 
roundsman you see, 
And respected no matter where'er I 
might be; 
They put sthripes on my arms to look solid and grand, 
For they knew I 
was a 
hero from dear Paddy's land; 
But it's very strange, my friends, if I 
don't soon be mayor, 
For there's not a 
man more able or fit for that chair, 
And providing they will, 
do everything I 
can 
hould my reputation as a 
true Irishman. 
-For as I•promenade, etc.

Price 40 cents. 
W HEN I'm dead and gone from you, darling, 
When I'm laid away in my grave, 
When my spirit has gone to heaven above, 
To Him who my soul will save ; 
When you are happy and gay once more, 
Thinking of days that have been; 
This one little wish I 
ask of you— 
See that my grave's kept green. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, the days will come to you, darling, 
When on earth no more I'll be seen; 
One sweet little wish, darling, grant me— 
See that my grave's kept green. 
Though the hOurs of joy now are passing, 
Yet how soon, alas ! they will fade ; 
Though your glances of love are meeting my own, 
Fair sunlight will turn to shade ; 
When from the world and its hopes I 
go, 
Leaving forever this scene, 
Though others are dear, ah, will you then 
See that my grave's kept green ? 
Oh, the days, etc. 
Will you keep me, love, in remembrance, 
Though the voice of chiding be heard ? 
And while others may speak in censure or blame, 
Yet breathe no unkindly word; 
Tell me you'll think of the happy past, 
Think of the joys we have seen ; 
This one little promise keep forme— 
See that my grave's kept green. 
Oh, the dayn, etc.

As soon as e'er the news was told, 
In every neighbor comes; 
Some said, " What a

Others, " Bless its gums I" 
My feelings were so glorious,

THE theatre was full, it was Dorkins' night, 
That is, Dorkins was going to appear 
At night in a 
favorite comedy part, 
For he was comeclian here. 
Funny ? why, he'd make you laugh 
Till the tears ran clown your face like rain, 
And as long as Dorkins was on the stage 
You'd try to stop laughing in vain. 
A 
family ? yes, he'd a 
family, 
And he loved them as dear as life, 
And you'd scarcely find a 
happier lot 
Than Dorkins' children and wife. 
And you'd scarcely find a 
happier lot 
Than Dorkins' children and wife. 
There came one night, 
And I 
was in front, 
And Dorkins was going to play 
A 
character new to himself and the stage 
That he'd trod for so many a 
day. 
- 
By eight the theatre was perfectly crammed, 
All awaited a 
pleasant surprise, 
For they knew they would laugh 
Till their sides would ache, 
And they longed for the curtain to rise. 
The play soon. began ; 
Each neck was stretched forth, 
And eagerly watched each eye 
For Dorkins to make 
His " first entrance," and then 
4: 
To give him a 
cheerful " Hi, hi 1" 
(1) 
DORKINS' NIGHT.—Conelnded: 
He soon appeared 
Amid loud applause, 
But something was wrong 
You could see. 
" 
Dorkins is playing 
Quite badly to-night," 
The people said sitting round me. 
A 
hiss ? yes, it was. 
I 
saw Dorkins start 
As though stung by a 
serpent's fang; 
Then he'd cast a 
beseeching glance all around, 
And his head on his breast would hang. 
He's drunk, and really 
I 
thought so myself. 
For to me it was awful at times 
To see how he'd struggle 
Along with his part, 
And continually stick in his lines. 
The footlights at last 
He approached very slow, 
And, " Ladies and gentlemen," said, 
" 
If I 
cannot please you to-night, 
The fault's not the heart, 
But the head. 
There's many a 
night 
I've made you all laugh 
When so ill I 
could scarcely 
Well stand, 
And. every effort was pain to me then, 
Yes, if even I 
raised but my hand.. 
You hiss me to-night, 
And think that I'm drunk 
(From his heart came a 
sob and a 
moan) ; 
I'll tell you the reason--
I 
know you won't laugh— 
I've a 
little one dying at home."

SOON I 
will leave thee, 
My dear German home, 
In a 
new land afar off, 
A 
stranger I'll roam; 
Away from the friends 
Who have loved me so dear, 
But though far away, 
In my heart ever near. 
CHORUS, 
My old German home, 
On the banks of the Rhine, 
May the sun of prosperity 
On it brightly shine; 
I'm going to leave thee, 
Afar off to roam, 
But I'll never forget 
My old German home. 
I 
see around me, 
Those friends kind and true, 
Who have loved me since childhood,1

To this good. home once more,.

FAR away in sunny meadows, 
Where the merry sunbeams play'd, 
Oft I 
lingered ' mid the clover, 
Singing to a 
village maid; 
She was fairer than the fairest, 
Ever faithful, fond, and true ; 
And she wore beneath a 
bonnet, 
Amber tresses tied in blue. 
CHORT.TS• 
She was fairer than the, fairest., 
Ever faithful, fond, and true : 
And she wore beneath a 
bonlaet. 
Amber tresses tied in blue. 
Ere the summer days departed, 
We had made a 
solemn vow; 
And I 
never, never wearied 
Kissing, her sweet cheek and brow. 
She was dearer than the dearest, 
Pure as drops of morning dew; 
And adown her neck was hanging 
Amber tresses tied in blue. 
She was .her, etc. 
'Twas decreed that rate should part us 
Ere the leaves of autumn fell, 
And two loving hearts were severed, 
That had loved each other well. 
She was all I 
had to cherish, 
She has bade a 
last adieu, 
And I 
see in ev'ry vision 
Amber tresses tied in blue. 
She was fairer, etc. 
HOME RULE. 
As sung by JOHNNY Ros.cu. 
Composed by Mlary Lzsricry. 
Copyright, 18M, by JoaN Rokcir. 
Ifs many years ago in Ireland, you must know, 
Since happiness looked down on our land, 
Our sons they then were free, and the star of liberty 
Shone gloriously on every Irishman. 
But let us bar the door on the days that are no more, 
There's a 
light a 
beaming on us from afar, 
If you listen unto me I 
will tell you, do you see, 
The sentiments of Pat of Mullingar. 
CHORUS. 
Hurrah for Erin's Isle, though her sons you can beguile, 
Because they know the wolf is at the door, 
Yet may our flag be seen aloft. in College Green, 
And a 
Home Rule in Ireland evermore. 
In England they may boast that our Parliament is lost, 
And say that we never should complain; 
Would you have my heart be light when I 
know for this very 
right 
My countrymen are wishing o'er the main 
Gladstone he may rave, but our country for to save, 
These words they should be heard from shore to shore, 
For O'Connell he did say, before he passed away, 
A Home Rule for Ireland for evermore. 
Hurrah for, etc. 
There's one now in his grave who struggled hard to save 
Our country from oppression long ago, 
Henry Grattan is his name, and may heaven be his gain, 
His energy on Ireland did bestow. 
His voice he never gave our people to enslave, 
Nor drive them to a 
far and distant shore, 
May the ilowerlets ever wave upon our hero's grave, 
And a 
Home Rule in Ireland for evermore. 
Hurrah for, etc. 
There's a 
laurel for the brow of the one who's striving now 
To win our Legislature back again, 
John Martin, ever bold our misery to unfold, 
And Ireland for the Irish will maintain. 
But let us all unite to drink this toast to-night, 
May happiness revisit Erin's shore, 
And the plan of Isaac Butts, from the palace to the huts, 
Be a 
Home Rule for Ireland for evermore.

GRANDPA'S chair is vacant, 
Near the fire in the grate, 
'Where he told his tales of boyhood— 
Kept the little ones awake ; 
One eve, so worn and weary, 
Sleeping on his knee they lay, 
Death called that night —like the fire bright, 
Grandpa passed away. 
CHORUS. 
So let the room be cheerful— 
Place the old arm-chair 
Where we talked to grandpa, 
With his sily'ry snow-white hair; 
How he'd watch the falling ashes, 
And sadly meditate, 
Gently sigh, We all must die, 
Like the fire in the grate. 
One bitter night in winter, 
The snow fell fast and wild ; 
A 
girl looked in the window— 
A 
careworn, hapless child; 
Then grandpa whispered, " Baby," 
And toddled to the gate, 
To save from sin he brought her in, 
Near the fire in the grate. 
So let the room be cheerful, etc. 
Keep the fire burning, 
'Tis charity's bright flame, 
Reminding of the evening 
The orphan Mary came, 
So ragged, cold, and hungry, 
With grandpa from the gate; 
For him she kneels, a 
pray'r she yields, 
Near the fire in the grate. 
So let the room be cheerful, etc.

Reverses in business brought me to a

One evening last week, the other end of the town, 
Whilst wandering sadly along, 
I 
picked up a 
purse that a 
lady had dropped, 
The temptation to keep it was strong. 
My pockets were empty, but firmly I 
said, 
She shall have her own come what will; 
She looked at my dress as I 
gave it and said, 
"If you're pour, you're a 
gentleman still."—ao,

Last evening I 
rescued a 
poor homeless girl 
ll'hom a 
swell was insulting; I 
found 
My streno-th for the moment was something immense, 
As I 
hurled the great brute to the ground. 
He cried out, " you beggar. don't meddle with me 
Or very soon you'll get a 
pill." 
But I 
said, " lay a 
hand on that girl arid you'll find 
If I'm poor, I'm a

THE BUSY B'S. 
An original song, as sung by FRANZ LEWIS, with immense succeu. 
A 
STRANGE name for my song I've,selected, 
But still I 
will try you to please ; 
They are men of bad deeds been suspected, 
And I'll call them the great Busy B's. 
Now it's simply because that same letter, 
Is the one that commences their name; 
So I 
took it for want of a 
better— 
They are men of renown and great fame. 
CHORUS. 
Now Beelzebub was the first B, sir, 
He made Eve steal the fruit from the tree, sir; 
Caused mankind its shame first to see, sir, 
He was the most wonderful B. 
Belshazzar one day gave a 
dinner, 
And invited his Senators, all; 
But he found he was scarcely a 
winner, 
When the writing appeared on the wall. 
Brigham Young gets his wives by the hundred, 
He's babies, I'm told, by the score ; 
But not satisfied, the old rascal, 
He is constantly wishing for more. 
CHORUS. 
Ben Butler with one eye does see, sir— 
He goes that same eye on a 
fee, sir— 
He is a 
most comical B, sir, 
That ever this nation did see. 
Mr. Beecher to the people still preaches, 
Giving sly winks at each pretty Miss ; 
Henry Bowen says bad things he teaches, 
He is best at a 
sweet fragrant kiss. 
Spain speaks o.f apologies given— 
Will that bring the dead back to life ? 
;1) 
THE BUSY B'S.—Concluded. 
Will that aid the wives and children 
Of thc; victims who fell in the strife ? 
CHORUS. 
We want Burril, the butcher, on high, sir, 
On a 
gibbet that shall reach to the sky, sir, 
Like the men he has murdered, to die, sir ; 
Not till then will lte listen to Spain. 
Mr. Blaine is a 
B 
that was Speaker, 
He hails from away down in Maine; 
For the chair in the White House, a 
seeker, 
No fool of a 
B 
was old Blaine. 
Mr. Babcock, the gay and the frisky, 
Is a 
B 
that went in for the tin ; 
He made his small pile out of whiskey— 
But stealing by law is no sin. 
CHORUS. 
Boss Tweed and Boss Shephard, so great, sir, 
Made cash at a 
tremendous rate, sir; 
Our currency went to inflate, sir— 
These men were such Busy B's. 
But the worst B 
of all in the nation, 
Who late did his pockets well fill— 
Is the one from the poor soldier's ration 
Did steal what he could at Fort Sill. 
Aaron Burr, we are told, was a 
traitor— 
For his country he did not care a 
rap'; 
Though perhaps his proud soul did bate her— 
Was he worse than our General Belknap ? 
CHORUS. 
Such men you'll agree with me, sir, 
Are a 
disgrace to the land of the free, sir; 
'Tis in prison they all ought to be, sir, 
These wonderful great Busy B's.

Price 10 cents. 
I'VE just been out to see the boys, 
They invited me to drink, 
Well knowing if we taste life's joys 
We must not stop to think ; 
And that's about the right idea, 
At least I've found it so; 
To shout and cheer, drink wine and beer, 
No matter where we go; 
To shout and cheer, drink wine and beer, 
No matter where we go. 
CHORUS. 
Then hip, hurrah! hip, hurrah! we'll go and have a 
spree, 
Hip, hurrah ! hip, hurrah I 
so come along with me, 
Hip, hurrah ! hip, hurrah ! let's go and have a 
lark, 
We never will go home, no, not while it's dark. 
'Tis well for fogies to deny 
The pleasures they forego, 
And tell us that we've got to die, 
We know that to be so; 
Let them enjoy life as they may, 
And we will do the same ; 
Our spirits light, our hearts are gay, 
And we'll uphold our name ; 
Our spirits light, our hearts are gay, 
And we'll upnold our name. 
Then hip, hurrah, etc. 
I 
care not how the times may go, 
I 
never look for pain ; 
I 
do not choose to search for woe, 
For one I 
do refrain ; 
So come and join me in my spree, 
And have a 
jolly game ; 
We now start in with one, two, three, 
Hurrah ! we're off again ; 
We now start in with one, two, three, 
Hurrah I 
we're off again; 
Then hip, hurrah, etc. 
SOMETHING THAT OUGHT TO BE DONE. 
MOTTO SONG. 
Sung by FRANK LEWIS with great success. 
Tins world is advancing each moment and hour, 
And startling improvements are made, 
Each nation is striving to gain greater power, 
All others to throw in the shade ; 
And each individual struggles along, 
For he knows that when life is begun, 
To gain great distinction he really muSt try 
To do something that's never been done. 
This city has many attractions, I 
own, 
But still there is something amiss ; 
The streets and the parks should be kept neat and clean, 
My idea for improvement is this : 
There are plenty of good honest men out of work, 
With hunger and debt overrun, 
rhey are willing to toil, let us give them the chance, 
It is something that ought to be done. 
Our country is burdened with debt and distress, 
Its people are suffering, too; 
Our finances are in a 
terrible mess, 
And the prospect at present looks blue ; 
There is only one way to prosperity now, 
For corruption has had a 
long run, 
We should have the right man at the head of our land, 
It is something that ought to be done.

Ill let the old folks know. (

Don't get weary, don't get weary, children, 
Don't get weary, for I's a-going home; 
Don't get weary, don't get weary, children, 
Don't get weary, for I's a-going home. 
exonus, second. 
When the sun rise in the morning, 
Down by the yellow corn, 
There we darkeys all take warning, 
When Dina blows the horn. (

When I'm gone you'll miss me, 
When I'm gone you'll miss me; 
There is one kind heart will miss me when 
I'm gone, yes, when I'm gone. (
Repeat.) 
Oh, Susie, I've been a 
bad boy, 
But I 
won't do so any more, 
And if you give me your heart and hand, 
We'll go to the old Virginia shore. (

"No, mother, its only the wind, that's whistling through the

That's whistling through the door." 
[PAT, outside, whistles " Garry Owen."] 
MARY (
listening).-013, that's the dear boy. 
Now if I 
only 
can keep him here unbeknown to my mother. 
[Enter the MOTHER, with a 
crutch.] 
MOTHER.—Mary dear. 
Mary, I 
say. 
Where are you ? 
MARY.—Here, mother dear. 
What is it you're after want-
ing with me? 
MorrrEn.—Didn't I 
bear somebody whistling, Mary? 
MARY.—Sure, it was the wind, mother. 
MOTHER sgs. 
I've lived a 
long time, Mary, in this wide world, my dear; 
But the wind to whistle a 
tune like that I 
never before did 
hear. 
MARY sings. 
But, mother, you know the fiddle hangs just behind the 
chink, 
And the wind upon the strings of it is playing a 
tune, I 
think ; 
Is playing a 
tune, I 
think. 
(

THE WHISTLING THIEF.--[CoNneuEn.] 
[PAT, outside, barks like a 
dog.] 
MOTHER sings. 
The dog is barking now, and a 
fiddle can't play a 
tune. 
MARY sings. 
But, mother, you know that dogs will bark when they see 
the moon. 
MOTHER sings. 
But how can he see the moon, when you know he's old and 
blind; 
Blind dogs can't see the moon, nor fiddles be played by the 
wind, 
Nor fiddles be played by the wind. 
[PAT, outside, imitates a 
pig.] 
MOTHER sings. 
And there now is the pig, °fleas), 
in his mind. 
MARY sings. 
But, mother, you know the saying, that pigs can see the 
wind. 
MOTHER sings. 
That's all very well in the day, but allow me, miss, to re-
mark 
That pigs, no more than ourselves, can see anything in the 
dark, 
Can see anything in the dark. 
MOTHER.—So, so, my daughter; get out wid your excuses. 
You can't decave your ould mother. 
MARY. — But, mother dear. 
MOTHER.-011, go 'long wid ye. 
MOTHER sings. 
I'm not such a 
fool as ye think, I 
know very well it is Pat. 
[Goes to window.] 
Get out, ye whistling thief, and get along home out of that;

THE WHISTLING THIEP.—[CoNTINuED.] 
And you, miss, be off to your bed; don't bother me wid you4 
tears; 
For though I've lost my eyes, I 
haven't yet lost my ears, 
I 
haven't yet lost my ears. 
[Exit MOTHER, shaking her crutch at MARY.] 
PAT (
at window).—Whist, Mary mavourneen 
Darlint, aro 
you there ? 
MARY.—Yes, Pat; but be aisy, me mother is wide awake. 
PAT.-011, bad luck to her—I 
mane, God bless the ould 
woman. [Climbs through window.] 
MARY.—Oh, I 
know she'll hear us.

THE WHISTLING THIEr.—[CoNTINTED.] 
Now, boys, don't courting go too near to the house, d'ye mind; 
Unless you're certain sure the old woman's both deaf and 
blind; 
The days when they were young, forget they never can, 
They're able to tell the difference ' twixt a 
fiddle, pig, dog 
and a 
man; 
A

I 
AM thinking to-day 
Of dem years dat passed away, 
When dey tied me up in bondage long ago; 
In old Virginny State, 
It was dar we separate, 
And it fill'd my heart with misery and woe. 
Dey took away my boy, 
He was his mother's joy ; 
From a 
baby in de cradle we him raise; 
Oh, dey put us far apart, 
An' it broke de ole man's heart, 
In dem agonizing, cruel slay'ry days. 
CH 0 
RUS. 
Dey never come again, 
Let us give our praise to Him 
Who looks down whar de little children play; 
So ev'ry night and morn, 
We will pray for dem dat's gone, 
In dem agonizing, cruel Slav'ry days. 
Still my mem'ry will steal o'er 
To dat dear old cabin floor, 
When de shadow of de sun came peeping in; 
At night, when all was dark, 
We would hear de watch- dog bark, 
And we'd listen to de murmur of de wind. 
It seem to say to me, 
" 
You people must be free," 
For de happy time am coming, Lord be praisid! 
For then we would weep and moan, 
For our souls was not our own, 
In dem agonizing, cruel slay'ry days. 
Day never, etc. 
I 
am very old and feeble, 
And our life am nearly done; 
/ 
have travell'd in the roughest kind of road; 
Thro' sickness, toil and sorrow, 
I 
have reach'd de end at last, 
And I'm resting by de wayside wid my load. 
Forget now and forgive, 
Has always been my guide, 
For dat's what de golden Scripture surely says; 
But our mem'ry will turn round, 
When our souls dey were tied down, 
In dem agonizing, cruel slaiery days. 
Dey never, etc. 
PLODDING THROUGH THE RAIN 
Sitting lately at my window 
On a 
rainy day, 
Time I 
whiled away by watching 
All who passed that way. - 
From the weather some protected, 
Others moved in pain; 
Some in hunger, cold, neglected, 
Wretched in the rain. 
Plodding, tripping, 
Drenched and dripprrtg, 
Wretched in the rain. 
Postman conies, delivers letters, 
- Sorely l'm afraid, 
Of public servants, few are better, 
None so badly paid. 
Men must vary in their station, 
Let him not complain ; 
But heaven keep him from temptation, 
Plodding through the rain. 
Plodding, tripping, etc. 
A female form my eye next catches, 
Carrying a 
child, 
Singing snatches, Belling matches, 
See, the infant smiled. 
Still closer nestled to its mother, 
Drops to sleep again ; 
May He befriend them—they've no other. 
Wretched in the rain. 
Plodding, tripping, eta 
Relief I 
gave them, food and money, 
Speedily they're gone ; 
, 
Grim policeman, gaunt and stoney, 
Bids her to move on. 
Duty makes this man suspicious, 
Beggars sigh in vain; 
He thinks all kindness injudicious, 
To paupers in the rain. 
Plodding, tripping, •to. 
Eyes half opened, peeping from an 
Old, uneasy seat, 
Weather-beaten, apple-woman, 
Wherefore in the street? 
To the gin shop should she totter, 
Just to get a 
drain; 
For such indulgence pray blame not her, 
Sitting in the rain. 
Sitting, slipping, etc. 
See, with pliant step and supple, 
Two folks next appear; 
Watch that loving, courting couple, 
Closer drawing near. 
'Neath one small umbrella walking, 
Whispering, love's old strain, 
needless of the weather, talking, 
Happy in the rain. 
Trotting, tripping, eta 
Rest to some men would be hunger, 
Hand to mouth they live ; 
Carma.n, ' busman, oyster dredger, 
Daily have to strive 
Watching life's damp, dreary feature, 
I've not looked in vain, 
If more I 
love my fellow creature, 
Plodding in the rain. 
As sung by TONY PASTOR. 
SoarE very good sayings I've heard in my time, 
And some I 
believe to be true; 
The one I 
will mention to-night in my song 
Is one that is well known to you; 
If you meet a 
man who is down in the world, 
And assistance you can't give him any, 
Remember that many can always help one, 
Where one cannot always help many. 
CHORUS. 
Then give what you can to those in distress, 
Let it be a 
dime or a 
penny, 
For.many can help one, I've heard people say, 
Where one cannot always help many. 
How often a 
trifle would save a 
man's life 
When he is near dying from want; 
He's tried to live honest all through his lifetime, 
But finds in the end that he can't ; 
At last he is tempted to steal or to starve, 
His rich friends they all pass him by, 
They heed not his wishes, they care not his wants, 
lie's left like a 
dog there to die. 
Then give what you can, etc. 
A man may be wealthy one end of the year, 
The next one be wretched and poor; 
He's struggled his hardest to keep himself up, 
But has sunk down to poverty's door; 
Such men as these deserve your support, 
So give it to them who most need, 
For those who've experienced poverty know 
'Tis a 
very hard battle indeed. 
Then give what you can, etc. 
I 
hope what I've mentioned to-night in my song, 
That nothing I've said out of place; 
A man may be poor, but still honest be. 
For poverty, 'tis no disgrace; 
Then give what you can with a 
generous heart, 
No knowing, when the tide it may turn; 
Just give him a 
chance to rise up in the world, 
And your kindness he's sure to return. 
Then give what you can, etc.

MeCAFFREY'S OLD HORSE. 
Written by JACK CONROY, and given by him to his friend JOHNNY ROACH. 
I'M going to sing you a 
ditty, 
I'm sure it will cause you to smile, 
It's about an old horse in the city 
That sticks out his tail in grand style; 
Although the poor creature looks lazy, 
Not a 
horse in the land, I'll go bail, 
Could travel so quick and so easy, 
Providing he got a 
square meal. 
CHORUS. 
He was the horse that could travel, 
Providing you kept him well fed ; 
He could trot upon stones or on gravel, 
And make other horses in dread. 
Some say the horse was short-winded, 
Some say he got nothing to eat, 
gore say he was high-minded, 
And that he was full of conceit ; 
But while the poor horse he was living, 
He eat many a 
bundle of hay ; 
But now that he's dead we'll forgive him, 
For a 
horse, like a 
dog, has his day. 
He was the horse, etc.

BIDDY DOYL E. 
Sung by JOHNNY ROACH. 
! 
I 
nave come over here, Biddy Doyle, 
For to tell you pretty clear, Biddy Doyle, 
For to gain your heart and hand, 
As you will understand, 
And to be at your command, Biddy Doyle. 
So I 
will always prove true, 
No matter what you do, 
And I 
will stick to you like glue, Biddy Doyle 
Oh! the summer is past and gone, Biddy Doylos 
And the winter is coming on, Biddy Doyle; 
And the stormy winds will blow, 
It will hail, rain and snow. 
And what will become of you, Biddy Doyle, 
What will you do at all, 
When the snow begins to fall, 
With your back against the wall, Biddy Doy16 ? 
You know how it is yourself, Biddy Doyle, 
You will soon be on the shelf, Biddy Doyle; 
You know you are old enough, 
And your face is getting rough, 
Another year will make you tough, Biddy Doyle. 
So leave off your lamentation, 
And increase the population, 
Or you are not worthy of your nation, Biddy Doyle. 
Oh ! when I 
go on a 
spree, Biddy Doyle, 
I 
will raise lots of fun, you'll see, Biddy Doyle; 
If I 
should come home tight, 
Don't try to raise a 
fight, 
Or I'll giveyou a 
bos: that will make you quiet, Biddy Doyle; 
Don't call the neighbors around me, 
Or if you do I'll surely pound you, 
And I 
will spit on you and drown you, Biddy Doyle, 
DISSoLvrNG VIEWS. 
posed and sung by GEOHGE HARRIS, English Comic, and given by him 
to JOHNNY' Rosca. 
Am.—" Castles in the Air." 
W HILE thinking of some past events at borne the other night, 
Seated at my cheerful fire, which then was burning bright, 
At last the fire began to fade—a 
shadow o'er it grew; 
I 
fancied I 
was looking at some great dissolving view; 
Some views there were that gave me joy, while others gave me 
pain; 
Oh, may I 
never see them in reality again; 
So give me your attention, and I'll quickly tell to you 
Some pictures that I 
witnessed in my great dissolving view. 
The first view was of sad distress, a 
truly wretched case; 
The family of a 
workimiman, hunger stared them in the face; 
The mother and their children gathered round a 
scanty fire, 
The last spaiks even threatening every moment to expire; 
At last the father enters, and hangs his honest bead, 
And silently he shares with them his last loaf of bread; 
Though honest, be is forced to steal, and into jail he's threw; 
This sad and truthful picture is my second dissolving view. 
The next was a 
police court; two prisoners in were led; 
One, a 
well-dressed swindler, and the other a 
boy ill-fed; 
The boy had stolen, and confessed his guilt, and for pardou 
, did entreat; 
Re said, " I 
am an orphan boy, and nothing bad to eat ;" 
Three months hard labor was his doom—the tears ran down 
his face; 
While he who swindled many a 
man walked out with a 
good 
grace; 
He paid for counsel with his spoil—his money put him through, 
That ends the case, and he gets free in this dissolving view. 
The third it was a 
murder cold, a 
tragic one, I'm sure; 
It was a 
man of manly heart, and a 
good friend to the poor, 
Shot down by an assassin dastardly and cold; 
But shooting men quite unawares is the fashion now, I'm told; 
The murder of Jim Fisk. I 
mean, a 
man known to you all; • 
In this wide world he played his part, and rolling kept the ball; 
I 
hope his spirit's gone aloft, I 
most sincerely do, 
Ever more to rest in peace in this dissolving view. 
44 
ZHEY ALL DO IT. 
As sang by Tn:ir PASTOR. 
SOME folks will cry, " Oh, shame, Mr. Jones, you are to 
blame; 
I 
never should have thought it, sir, of you;" 
While if they'd look at home, before abroad they'd roam, 
I'm positive they'd have enough to do. 
Mr. Brown says it's a 
sin that Mr. Smith drinks gin, 
And harbors all the gang from day to day; 
When Mr. Green was caught doing what he didn't ought, 
When he in self-defence was heard to say--
cam-
vs. 
They all do it, they all do it, 
They all do it, though oft-times they rue it; 
Yet they all do it, they all do it, 
And so it will continue to the end of the world, 
For hours three or four lovers spooning at the door 
On any pleasant morning may be seen; 
And if they have a 
kiss 'twill never come amiss, 
And they enjoy it, though they say they didn't mean; 
When creeping down the stairs comes the old man un-
awares, 
And kissing catches the couple in the act, 
The mother from above says, " Don't interfere, my love, 
You can't dispute this most important fact—" 
They all do it, etc. 
Old women do declare girls ihoulcl never dye their hair, 
And then again they say it's very nice, 
Without the least restraint, their faces so to paint, 
And rob the cats and clogs of all their mice; 
(1) 
4:3 
THEY ALL DO IT.—Concluded. 
Each girl a 
little " puff " has inside a 
seal-skin muff, 
They are never seen without it, night or day; 
And her " turnup 
nose she'll powder, if a 
moment is 
allowed her, 
When, if you laugh, she'll innocently say— 
They all do it, etc. 
But what does most impress is the style in which they 
dress; 
It's enough to make you laugh when them you see; 
They've a 
hat upon their heads large enough to make up 
beds 
For " pussy " cats with kittens two or three; 
In their paniers too behind, if examined, you will find 
The most important papers of the day; 
The " Clipper," if you chose, the " Herald," and the 
"News," 
Or anything that chance puts in their way. 
They all do it, etc. 
There's my neighbor, Mrs. West, who's expensive in her 
dress, 
And her husband only gets nine dollars every week; 
I've often heard him say, " If things go on this way, 
We'll a 
lodging in the station have to seek, 
For the doctor and the nurse will drain my scanty purse, 
With many more expenses to defray; 
Then he gets into a 
passion when they tell him it's the 
fashion, 
And they soothe him when they sing this truthful lay— 
For they all do it, etc.

W 
a 
started for the fair, 
With spirits light and hearty, 
Behind McCarthy's mare; 
Oh, it was a 
lively party! 
You never saw the likes of it, 
Believe me what I 
say! 
Sure we bad a 
roaring racket, 
But the mare she ran away. 
Off she whit! off she wint! 
Be gob, I 
wasn't worth a 
cint I 
The sate was jist as hard as flint, 
Behind McCarthy's mare. 
CHORUS. 
"Hould her in!" McCarthy cried; 
" 
Stop her !" says McCue; 
I 
thought I'd shake to pieces 
As along the road we flew! 
Me head was swimming like a 
top, 
My heart was in despair, 
The divil himself was in the wheels 
Behind McCarthy's mare. 
McCarthy held the reins, 
And Murphy held McCarthy, 
But whiskey filled their brairis, 
And made them wild and hearty; 
Maloney tumbled out behind, 
And there we let him lay— 
Sure I 
offered to assist him, 
But the mare she ran away. 
Off she wint! off she wint! 
Be gob, I 
wasn't worth apcint 
The sate was jist as hard as flint, 
Behind McCarthy's mare. 
" 
floald her in i" mte.

THE RUNAWAY M.ARE.—Conoluded. 
Me dacent coat was tore, 
Me hat was left behind me; 
I 
rattled and I 
swore, 
And I 
thought the dust would blind me; 
In holes and ditches whit the wheels-
0, murther 
such a 
day! 
Sure mesill was kilt intirely, 
With the mare that run away. 
Off she wint 
off she whit! 
Be gob, I

Do not weep, dear loving mother, 
Sad am Ito cause you pain; 
But something tells me I 
shall never 
See the summer flow'rs again. 
How I 
lov'd alone to wander 
In the happy days long flown, 
O'er field and meadow fair, to gather 
Bright-bud blossoms freshly blown; 
Soon beside the rippling river, 
Winding onward o'er the plain. 
The buds will burst, but I 
shall never 
See the summer ilow'rs again.

The first on the page is little Sally Sage, 
She once was a 
lady's maid; 
But she ran away on a 
very dark day, 
With a 
fellow in the fried fish trade. 
The next was a 
Cook, oh! a 
beauty with a 
hook, 
And I'll tell you the reason why! 
For a 
leg she'd a 
stump, on her back was a 
hump, 
And she'd got a 
little squint in her eye !—Cno. 
3 
Another one to charm was a 
Girl on a 
farm, 
Well versed in the harrows and ploughs; 
She guarded the rigs of a 
lot of little pigs, 
And squeezed new milk from the Cows. 
She was sixteen stone all muscle and bone, 
And she looked with an awful leer; 
And she would have been mine, but fell in a 
decline, 
Thro' swallowing a 
mouse in her beer !— Crio. 
4 
Then another one came, ah, a 
right jolly Dame, 
And her purse was as long as my arm, 
All full of yellow gold, such a 
sight to behold! 
Would the heart of a 
miser warm. 
And her only sin was a 
love for gin, 
But it brought our hopes to a 
wreck; 
For she slipp'd with her heel on a 
bit of orange peel, 
Fell down and broke her blessed neck.—Cno. 
5 
I 
could add to the score full a 
half dozen more, 
For the list is a 
long way round: 
One went o'er the sea for a 
better chap than me, 
And some of them were hanged or irowned. 
And the last I 
had through drink went mad, 
In vain I 
tried to stop her: 
And sad was my dismay to discover that one day, 
She'd been slowly boiled to death in the Copper.

WHY DIDINT`r YOU" SAY SO ZEFORE. 
As ou,?; by Gus W ILLIA518. 
New by-words you know now-a-days, are the rage, 
You'll hear them from every tongue ; 
Wherever you go you'll find that it's so, 
The little, the big, old and young; 
Even the ladies are fond of the slang, 
While the boys in the street loudly roar, 
Oh, how they do shout, the latest one out, 
Why didn't you say so before! 
One day driven mad with a 
toothache so bad, 
I 
rushed to the first doctor's shop, 
When the grinder he eyed and the tongs he appliPd, 
And he pulled rue six times round the shop; 
Said I, when he'd done, you've pulled out the wrong one, 
While with agony loud I 
did roar; 
Now it's done, sir, says he, the fault don't lay witli me; 
Why didn't you say so before 
I 
once asked a 
friend me ten dollars to lend, 
And said : I'd return it next day. 
When he did begin at once to rub his chin, 
And these words, unto me he did say ; 
Old boy, it's too bad, I 
should have been glad, 
In fact, I'd have let you have more 
Had you called yesterday,—now, it's all paid away, 
Why didn't you say so before 
My wife yesterday sat crying away, 
Because our first-born was a 
boy; 
All day she would sigh and keep rubbing her eye, 
Instead of being happy ,:
ith joy; 
Says she to me, Joe, I 
hate boys, you know, 
rd soone of girls have a 
score; 
Bap I (with a 
leer) it's too late, now, my dear, 
Why didn't you say so before

THE TIPPERARY MEN. 
OR, Tun ROLLICKING IRISIIMA.N. 
Sung by Jonlarr Rolm 
So, boys, I'm here once more you see, and a 
story I'm going to 
tell; 
It's something new between, me and you, which an Irishman 
befell ; 
'Twas in the town of Liverpool, in a 
street I 
forget the name, 
But to pass the time in the chorus join, just while I 
sing the 
same. 
CHORUS. 
His name was Pat—just think of that! awl beat it if you can; 
There'sm n
ao
n7 so gay, both night and day, 
as

rollicking 
Irish-
Whack, whack, whack, hurroo, tiddy I 
dow de dow, 
Whack, whack, whack, hurroo, tiddy I 
dow de dow; 
Oh, at a 
wake or a 
fair we're always there, the Tipperary men. 
Now the weather was cold, and this hero bold about for work 
did seek; 
He got a 
job to carry bricks at eighteen shillings a 
week; 
He bought a 
hod for half a 
crown from a 
man named Mickey 
Burke, 
And Pat so gay the very next day at six o'clock went to work.

To his work got drilled, when his hod was filled, how quick up

He was going to the top about twelve o'clock, but whether ' twas

This hero bold lie missed his hold, and down he came by the

Now, as Pat down did go, he put his hand so, and then a

He cried, " Och hone!" as down be catne; " may the Lord my

From my father's great ancestors it descended with gallore— 
It's a

An, ha! we're off so gayly, 
Now let others take the rear, 
We're coming solid to the front, 
Of that don't have a 
fear ; 
The Mulligan's, the Hoolahan's, 
The Dougherty's and all, 
When we're paradin' thro' the streets, 
We drive them to the wall. 
CHORUS. 
First the left and then the right, 
But never both together ; 
The tall, the short, the thick, the thin, 
We're worse, begob, than leather; 
As we're paradin' thro' the streets, 
I 
tell you we're the cards, 
We're bound to be the Hummers, 
We're the Donegan Light Guard I 
So now we are the darlings, 
On that you may bet high, 
We have a

And forty more besides. 
We don't mix with the common ones, 
For ourselves we have regard, 
We are " A One" above the crowd, 
We're the Donegan Light Guard! 
First the left, etc. 
Then you should come and see us 
As we march down Broadway; 
They are a 
gallant lot of men, 
I'm sure we'll hear you say. 
The " Seventh " come and gaze at us, 
And then they beat retreat ; 
It's no use, boys, they give it up, 
They know we can't be beat! 
First the left, etc.

My Love Nell." 
M Y name is Mike McClusky, from Ireland I 
came, 
And I've declared my intentions as an American citizen; 
I'm proud of my ancestors, for I 
came from the rale old stock, 
And on Patrick's day we march away and parade with our old 
hats. 
When the band does play we march away, the Kerrigans, the 
O's, and Macks, 
And the boys all shout, when we turn out, " Will you ever shoot 
that a 
t 
This hat was made for a 
cousin of mine in seventeen ninety-
eight, 
And when he died he left it to me, so it will never be out of 
date. 
It's travelled the wide says over, from Ireland to America, 
And it's seen to the best advantage upon St. Patrick's day. 
When the band does play, etc. 
Then come, brave boys, and join with us before it is too late, 
And we'll all turn out on Patrick's day, and that day we'll cele-
brate 
In honor of our native land, that land we wish was free; 
We invite all true-bred Irishmen to join in our company. 
When the band floes play, etc.

DANNY, 
GO AFTER YOUR FATHER. 
Sung with great success by JAMES BRADLEY. 
I'm Mrs. O'Malley, Roger's wife, 
lie is very fond of drink; 
From Monday morning till Saturday night 
Of nothing else he'll think, 
But go down to the corner store, 
Throw dice and play the cards; 
Instead of bringing his money home, 
He spends it on all the blackguards. 
CHORUS. 
Danny, go after your father, 
lie is down in the corner store, 
Playing forty-fives with the Dutchman— 
Against it he often swore; 
'Tell him come home to his supper, 
I 
know it will save his life ; 
So that's a 
good lad, 
Go after your dad, 
And tell him come home to his wife. 
Sometimes he takes the pledge, my boys, 
And he keeps it for a, week, 
Until Saturday night comes over his head, 
To the Dutchman's down he'll sneak; 
He makes believe he is going for coal, 
And through the side door he'll steal, 
He calls out to the bartender, 
Give me a 
big mug of ale! 
Danny, go after, etc. 
Now, dear friends, he's keeping stralght, 
And he never leaves the house; 
He sits down by the fire 
And reads his book, just like any mouse; 
I 
tell you we are happy, 
Around the house there's peace; 
But I 
understand there's an alderman 
Going to put him upon the police. 
Danny, go after, etc.

W HAT should make thee sad, my darling ? 
Why those pearly tears I 
see 
Have I 
caused one thought of sorrow? 
Have I 
not been kind to thee ? 
By the stars that shine above us, 
By their wondrous mystery, 
By this heart that beats within me, 
Still I 
love thee, love but thee. 
CHORUS.

What should make thee sad, my darling 1 
Why those pearly tears I 
see, 
Have I 
caused one thought of sorrow 1 
Have I 
not been kind to thee 1 
O'er the bosom of the ocean 
Shall the sea- bird cease to rove, 
Sun and stars shall cease their motion, 
Winds and clouds forget to move, 
E'er my love for thee shall falter, 
Or my faith forgotten be; 
All things else on earth may alter, 
Still I 
love thee, love but thee. 
What should mate thee sad, etc. 
Joyfully when first I 
found thee, 
Bowed my soul at love's behest; 
Now when sorrows gather round me, 
Thou alone can'st make me blest 
Be my heart thy throne forever, 
Let all tears forgotten be, 
Weal or woe estrange us never, 
Still I 
love thee, love but thee. 
What should make thee sad, eta. 
YOU CAN DO IT IF YOU WANT TO. 
Words and Music by Groner. G. HART.

York. Price 10 cents. 
I 
ONCE was deep in love with a 
charming little dear, 
And when in her society I 
always felt so queer, 
I 
rnuster'd up my cheek, and asked her for a 
kiss, 
She blush'd and hesitated, and answered me like this: 
CHORUS. 
You can do it if you want to, 
For I 
really can't resist you, 
You are such a 
charming fellow, 
To refuse you is absurd. 
As time pass'd on, I 
found I'd have to get a 
wife, 
I 
ask'd her if she'd like to be my better half thro' life 1 
Her answer it was yes, so to papa I 
went, 
And as id money plenty, why, be quickly gave consent. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, I 
was pretty well fixed, as I 
asked the " Old 
Gent" for his daughter's ban l, heart, and so forth, and he says : 
" 
Well, I've no objection of a:ourse; you know " Galatea" hasn't 
any money—but as long.aa you love her, why, that don't make 
any difference—and as to taaarrying her, my dear boy, why "— 
You can do it, etc. 
I 
went with rapid step a 
to tell her of my plan, 
And found her sitting on the lap of a 
handsome looking man, 
I 
scarce believ'd in7 eyes and started with dismay, 
And as be whispered in her ear, I 
plainly heard her say— 
SeoirEN.—" Neve? mind, Charley ; even if I 
do marry that 
" 
Snoozer," it wor.'t make any difference, I'll love you just the 
same as ever." 
7eems-es River! wasn't I 
mad—I 
told her she 
was false to me, and that I 
never would marry her—that I 
would 
not believe 1r even if she'd make a 
statement—and as for her 
" 
Charley," why, be could have her and welcome. I 
told her I 
'would leave, and she should never set eyes on me again—and 
" 
I :lope I 
may never" if she didn't say— 
You can do it, etc. 
The moral of my tale you all can plainly see, 
Don't marry any girl, my boys, tho' handsome she may be, 
Unless she loves but you, I 
(mess you'll find I'm right, 
They're bound to have a " Charley" when you are out of sight. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, and all I've got to say is, if any of you chaps 
want to marry such a 
girl as that, why— 
You can do it, etc.
