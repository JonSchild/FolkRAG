00:02:52:  Began as care provider in 2010 and resumed over last seven months.  Worked for man 
who had had a stroke.  Took him to store, to appointments, cooked, cleaned house.  Other lady

her happy.”

mother, who is disabled and has diabetes.  Same help as others she has worked for.  Needs lots of 
patience. 
 
00:06:52:  In 2010 needed a new job.  Easier job working with clients.  Previously, had client 
with Parkinson’s disease.  Client was big and hard to work with.  Working for mother easier. 
 
00:08:05:  Everyone gets old.  Likes to make older clients feel better.  Thinks about what it will 
be like when she gets old and how she will be treated. 
 
00:09:04:  Care providers need patience.  Make clients feel happy and comfortable with us.  
Some training from state and has to take it again.  Learn a lot of things to help do a good job.  
Clients upset because of life where they can’t do what they used to do.  Find words to explain 
how to make them feel good.

00:13:08:  Typical day:  helps prepare mother for appointments.  Take shower, lay out clothes, 
medicine.  Helps her with everything.  Talks with nurse about her mother’s diet and other things 
she needs. 
 
00:15:32:  Other clients—you can say what you want.  Have to be more careful around your 
mother.  Mother needs her a lot.  Best thing is working together.  Very different from other types 
of clients but also very good to take care of family. 
 
00:16:52:  Quit working with her mother.  Mother asked her to come back.  Much better now for 
both mom and daughter. 
 
00:18:25:  Friends with clients who are not family.  Saw former client in story, who asked her to 
come back. 
 
00:19:27:  Talked about Obama and politics with one client.  Client asked questions about her 
family.  Taught not to talk about your problems with clients.  Mother says she makes tortillas 
that are “more beautiful” for her clients than for her. 
   
00:23:04:  Intimate care:  one client she had to wash from knees down and wash his back.  Pay 
attention to what he needs.  Doesn’t see anything.  Other man she cared for was embarrassed 
during bathing.  Just try to do my work.  Easy for me.  Stay focused. 
 
00:26:28:  Important to be able to laugh but with, not at the people you care for. 
 
00:28:05:  Gratifying to spend time with her mother.  Other clients—gets to see where they live.  
We will all end up there.  Has learned a lot from these experiences. 
 
00:29:01:  Learned English from Anglo clients.  Has to write letters for some clients and has 
improved her writing skills.  Learned about illnesses that affect elderly and how to manage.  
Learns about things she will encounter when she gets older. 
 
00:30:58:  Not difficult in comparison to other work.  “Labor of the home”:  like taking care of 
your own children. 
 
00:31:56:  New to union.  Has been a member for approximately one month.  Wants to help and 
participate.  Union can help with workers compensation, lawyers, support. 
 
00:34:06:  Must have lots of patience.  Take advantage of classes.  Do whatever clients ask.  
Don’t answer questions if you don’t know.

00:35:52:  Relaxes by going swimming, taking walks to park and store, watching TV. 
 
00:37:47:  Clients with multiple caregivers-- need to explain routine to new caregivers.  Need 
greater consistency in these circumstances.  Happened with her mother and having different 
caregivers every day.  No opportunity to get to know new caregivers.  And clients themselves 
sometimes forget. 
 
00:39:31:  End of interview.
