APPETITE BELLE. 
Comic Song. 
Written and Coropo -ied by NEI) STIZAIGHT for 
:ions skl) JAMES IZUSSELT„ and sang by them with great 
success in their White and Slack Character Changes. 
I'll sing cf a 
damsel called Appetite Belle, 
She always could c.u., out the biegest hotel; 
She'd dtlik a 
wAl dry and cat hay by the bale, 
Eat oysters by thous:Inds and swallow a 
whale. 
Her teih were like tombstone --
1 
ali ready to mash 
Clams, lob-qers and ch:ckens, and wind up whit hash; 
She chewed up a 
has; drum ; a 
cornet. aud fife, 
And her chin was as sharp as a 
blade of a 
knife. 
The great Mammoth Cave of Kentucky 
small 
Compared with hcr mouth it was nowhere at all; 
And she was barefooted on top of the bead, 
What few hairs she had were a 
brindle tan red. 
Her left eye Attn.; yellow, the right black and blue, 
Slob- sided nose like a 
Chatham Street Jew; 
Her c,.rs were like dumplings, with no stuffing in, 
Her favorite tonic was onions and gin. 
She washes herself when she's caught in the rain. 
She's humpbacked and spavined, wind-broken and 
lame; 
And when Dr. Tanner once saw this girl eat, 
He went on a 
fast of a 
forly days' feat. 
If she had the victuals all at her command, 
There would be a 
famine all over the land; 
She'd starve us to death and choke us as well, 
She'd eat all the world up would Appetite Belle.

Oh I 
I 
look over yonder, what do I 
see, 
Coming for to carry me home; 
Two little angels a 
winking at me, 
Coming for to carry me home; 
Oh! what kind of shoes do the angels wear, 
Coming for to car y 
me home; 
They don't wear any, for they walk on the air, 
Coming for to carry me ho:ne; 
Going down the canal bank who do I 
chance to see 
Coming for tl carry me home; 
Old Jimmy Taylor was a 
lophing right at me, 
Coming for to carry me home; 
Said he, look here, brethren, I 
do believe, 
Coming for to carry me home; 
That's my chicken you got up your sleeve, 
Coming for to carry me home; 
Said I

You see that nigger over there ? 
His hair is filled with grease and care; 
Whene'er he sees my Rosa, dear, 
With jealous eyes he throws a 
stare; 
To her he wrote a 
billet doux, 
If you love me as I 
love you, 
No knife can cut our love in two; 
But Rosa said it would Jlot do. 
IKE SMITH. 
She is the worst I 
ever knew; 
Sh3 h 
is a 
mouth like a 
rubber shoe; 
She wears a 
pin-back dress so tight, 
And walks along an awful sight. 
(Dialogue. ) 
you don't mean to tell me that she's your gal. Why 
she looks as tall as Jumbo, and has a 
face like halt- past Si; 
and her feet are a 
very picture of a 
horse's hoof. 
JIM LEE. 
You have no right to talk about feet. 
Why your feet 
are so big you have to gct out of bed before you can turn 
over. 
IKE SMITH. 
She had on a 
pin-back dress the other day, and she looked 
so thin I 
thought she was going to fall down. 
JIM LEE. 
That was not a 
pin-back dress, that was a 
pull-back dress. 
IKE SMITH. 
I 
thought. so—the back was all pulled out of it. 
JIM LEE. 
I 
took her into a 
restaurant the other day, and ordered 
some dinner for her. 
Well, how she could eat. 
(Music Cue. 
Sings.) 
She had an appetite, it was a 
daisy; 
She was hungry, she was dry; 
And I 
couldn't see where she put away, 
Or where she stored the oysters, beer and pie. 
IKE SMITH. 
(spoken.) 
There you go again, talking about the gal's appetite. 
JIM LEE. 
I 
am not talking about her appetite, I 
am talking about 
what it cost. 
IKE SMITH. 
Why, you are not kicking about the ten cents you spent 
on her, are you?

(To the audience.) 
I 
saw him walking out with the gal last Tuesday. 
You 
ought to see the walk. 
It's something after this style: 
(Music Cue. 
Stns.) 
Dal da! Gussie dear, you're -a 
pet, 
You've cologne upon your ulster, 
You're a 
masher you can bet. 
You have Zozodont on your hair, 
So all the ladies say, 
I'll meet you in the wintsr 
When the bloom is on the hay. 
Jim LEE. 
Well, how do you suppose I 
won her love? 
IKE SMITH. 
Why, you borrowed ten dollars from her, 
JIM LEE. 
No. sir. I 
used to take my guitar and go under her win-
dow and sing: 
(Music Cue.) 
Awake love, awake love, awake love, and open the door, 
I 
know you're asleep by the way that you t-no:.e; 
And while you're reclining like a 
dove in y 
air nest, 
Your true love is catching a 
cold on his eliest. 
Awake love, awake love, awake lo-.' e, and listen to me, 
Awake love, awake love, yo6r true love an singing to thee. 
IKE Smrru. 
It's a 
wonder she didn't die with cramps af;er that sing-
ing. 
Well, I 
suppose you are going to marry her? 
JIM LEE. 
Yes, indeed, I 
am. 
She is a 
poor girl, but she's a 
good 
lions( keeper. 
She understands all about kitchen work, 
and she knows how to knead bread. 
IKE SMITH. 
Yes, it she marries you she will need (knead) bread.

A 
pathetic Poem, written by JULE KEEN, GERMAN COMEDIAN, 
and recited by JAS. RUSSELL, DICE Gortmas, and PENDY. 
It was in a 
lonely garret room, 
A. mother and daughter lay. 
They hadn't a 
mouthful of food to eat, 
Nor fire in the stove th it day. 
Faint and sick was the woman, poor, 
Stretched on a 
bed or pain, 
Her wrinkled checks and slender hands 
Bespakc how long she'd lain. 
Father, give us this day our daily bread, 
Was what the child did say, 
As she knelt beside the tattered quilt, 
And for a 
loaf of bread did pray. 
Filled with faith, 
She started out to find the place 
Where God dal keep his baker shop 
To Led the human race. 
l've come for that, said the little child, 
I've come for Ilia daily brea:d, 
And I 
want two of the biggest loaves, 
To the baker man she said. 
All ri ,
zht, alt 
Ight, said the baker man, 
There's the best two :ou've Ii : d 
yet. 
But stoo, come back, vod little thief, 
The money I 
did not ,crec. 
Wi h 
frightened look the ch.:d 
id say 
That she could noth m.r p

THE LOAF OF BREAD—CosTnarrn. 
I 
haven't got any money, sir, 
To pay for the bread to-day. 
Well, what do you think, 
You steal the bread? 
The police at once I'll call 
And I'll have you to the Island sent, 
For trying these two loaves to haul. 
With tears rolling down her cheeks, 
These Ivordi the little child said: 
Why the rood Father woul I 
give to all 
That ask this diy - ortie daily bread, 
And so I've come to get that bread, 
That He did say He'd give, 
And take it home to mother, dear, 
That she, poor MA, might live. 
The baker man now felt bad 
For what he had said, 
So he tilled her basket full 
Of this our daily bread. 
She went with speed of lightning, 
With blessings on her head, 
And told her mother she had found 
The place NvIler. God did bake his bread. 
With uplifted hands again .she prayed, 
And the sweet words she sai(l. 
Were thanks to Him for blessings sent, 
And this our DAILY BREAD.

Here we are two maidens fair, 
Of the men we do beware, 
The boys all say we're awful sweet, 
Oh! hi! oh! 
Think we're good enough to eat. 
CHORUS. 
Who wants to wed, 
Two maids well bred? 
Wedlock, wedlock is a 
bliss, 
First a 
squeeze and then a 
kiss, 
Then your tears prepare to shed— 
Who wants to wed? 
Every night when we retire, 
Many things we do require, 
Our cheeks they turn a 
crimson red, 
Oh! hi! oh! 
Men mi-ht be under our bed.

might wear their clothes out,

Darling, fold me to you closer, 
As you did in days of yore; 
Press your lips upon my forehead, 
Ere I 
see the golden shore. 
Life is from me fastly fleeting, 
Soon I'll be in sweet repose; 
When I'm gone I 
ask this favor, 
Lay my head beneath a 
rose.

Lay me where sweet flowers blossom.... 
Where the dainty lily grows; 
'Where the pink and violets mingle, 
Lay my head beneath a

met you, 
When I 
pledged you hand and heart, 
There were roses on your cheeks, love, 
And we vowed we ne'er would part. 
One more kiss, for I 
am going 
Far beyond all earthly woes ; 
Let my grave be like your cheeks, love, 
Covered with the blushing rose. 
Lay me where sweet Bowen, &C.

With dancing and singing from morning till night, 
And to imitate each one it is our delight ; 
Kind friends, pay attention, we've not long to stay, 
And the doings of play-actors we will now give away. 
There's two song and dance men, sure, in Room No. 9, 
With their feet they keep belting the floor all the time ; 
Their legs look like pipe- stems, with tight skinny pants, 
So we'll now imitate them while we have the chance. 
With dancing, &c.

The moon was shining on the lake, 
The stars shone from above ; 
Gazing on the water, 
My heart was filled with love; 
There I 
met my darling, 
Whose eyes with joy did beam; 
As gently I 
spoke to her 
Of young love's sweetest dream. 
CHORUS: 
Moonlight at Killarney, 
While stars shone from above; 
Oh, what bliss a 
loving kiss, - 
From hearts that beat with love; 
Oh! moonlight at Killarney, 
While stars shone from above; 
Oh what bliss a 
loving kiss, 
From hearts that beat with love. 
'Tis by the margin of the lake, 
Battles have been won; 
Not by spear or sword, 
But blarney of the tongue ; 
She I

As stars shone from above; 
She gently smiled upon me, 
While whisp'ring words of love.

remeinber the days that are now past and gone, 
When a 
child how I 
once loved to play, 
By the side of the mill that stands close by the stream, 
Where for pleasure I 
often would stray. 
But now I've grown old and quite feeble you see, 
And so has my poor Katharine, 
But I 
sigh when I 
think of my once happy days, 
In that little old house on the Rhine, 
CHORUS. 
It was lonely and cold and in winter ' twas drear, 
For the wind would assail it at times, 
Still there's no place on earth to my memory more dear. 
Than that little old house on the Rhine. 
Now the old school house stands just the same as before 
With the church and its spires so grand, 
Where fond stories of love to each other we'd tell, 
As together we'd walk hand in hand. 
It was there where the old folks for pleasure would stay, 
And bask ' neath the old shady vine, 
How they'd watch us at play when from school we'd return, 
To that little old house on the Rhine, 
It was lonely, &c. 
They are both dead and gone and they sleep side by side, 
In the grave by the end of the vale. 
Where the birds sweetly sing on a 
bright summer's eve, 
And play in the moonlight so pale. 
Good-bye dear old home, fare you well for awhile, 
You've sheltered me many a 
time, 
Oh ! I'd love to return to my old fatherland, 
And that little old house on the Rhine. 
It was lonely, &s,

THE HOME OF THE SHAMROCK. 
 •:

I'm a 
light-hearted girl from the green shores of Erin, 
The fairest and clearest place to me; 
Although small, its the gem little spot on the ocean, 
And how I 
long to see it free. 
There's where you'll find the true sons of Nature, 
All open-hearted, although some be poor; 
It's the land of my birth-place, forget it, no, never, 
The home of the Shamrock, old Ireland, asthore. 
Clloitus: 
Then hurrah for that bright little spot on the ocean, 
harmless around it the rude billows roar; 
Where true Irish hearts loved with fondest devotion, 
The home of the Shamrock, old Ireland, asthore. 
Soon I'll be back to my forefathers' country, 
There's where I 
ever long to roam; 
Where stout Irish lads they are willing and hearty 
To make for their friends a 
pleasant home. 
There's where my father and my poor aged mother 
Have lived, and are happy on Erin's green she; 
'Tis the land of St. Patrick, forget, I'll never, 
The home of the Shamrock, old Ireland, asthore.

FACES WE'LL NEVER FORGET. 
,g sung by FRANK Lgwis at Hyde & Behman's Theatre, Brooklyn 
have sung or the topics and the events of the day, 
But now for the present I've something new to say; 
I 
will speak of the men you have heard of and seen, 
Whose name in our memory will ever be green; 
The first is a 
friend in the hour of need, 
Who will stretch forth his hand is a 
true friend indeed; 
Wheti your pockets are empty, he'll stick to you yet, 
He's one of the faces we'll never forget. 
I 
will speak first of one in our hearts ever dear, 
And I'm sure our whole nation still wish he was here; 
A Martyr, a 
President, and worthy of mind, 
The exponent of right and virtue combined; 
He was murdered in Washington some years ago, 
Mid how deeply our country has felt the blow; 
Though gone from us now, though gone, we find yet 
Old honest Abe Lincoln we'll never forget. 
New York in its day has produced some good men, 
Who are known from this city unto the world's end; 
There's William Cullen Bryant who handled the pen, 
That has silenced the wrath of this world's greatest men; 
There's poor Tweed who died in Ludlow Street Jail, 
Whose life was a 
warning, a 
history, a 
tale; 
There's Fisk who was shot down whose loss we regret, 
These are some of the faces we'll never forget. 
The stage it has likewise produced some good names, 
Who have struggled how hard for honor and fame; 
There's Cushman, Davenport, Forrest as well, 
Sothern and others too numerous to tell; 
There's one who'll remain in our hearts even more; 
Though she's gone from our midst unto Heaven's bright 
shore; 
As dear a 
little maiden the stage has had yet, 
Ella Mayo's sweet face we should nerer forget.

Sweet woman she was intended to be, 
Everything that is nice! 
But sometimes she's as hot as the mustard pot, 
And sometimes far colder than ice! 
Sometimes she plays the lion's part, 
Whilst we have to play the lamb, 
That's likely to lead to family Jars, 
That never contain ally Jam.

Sometimes we wishi v'efii wings, 
Sometimes they make. sometimes they break,

A 
VIOLET FROM MOTHER'S GRAVE 
Words and Music by W ILL H. Fox. 
sung by Wm. McALoox in all the principal Theatres in A.m.Trica, and 
by OX EII & CONROY. 
Scenes of my childhood arise before my ga7.,e, 
Bringing recollections of my childhood's happy days; 
When down in the meadow in childhood I 
would roam, 
But there's no one left to cheer now within my good 
old home; 
Father and Mother they have passed away, 
Sister and Brother are laid licinntli the clay; 
But while life does remain, there's one thing I'll retain, 
A small Violet I 
plucked from Mother's Grave. 
CHORUS: 
Only a 
Violet I 
plucked when but a 
boy, 
And often when I'm . sad at heart, this plant has 
give rue joy; 
But while life does remain, in memorium I'll retain, 
That small violet I 
plucked from Mother's Grave. 
Flow well I 
remember my dear old Mother's smile, 
As she used to greet me when f 
returned from toil; 
Always knitting in the old arm chair, 
Father used to sit and read for all us children there; 
But now all is silent around the good old home, 
They all have left me in sorrow for to roam; 
While life does remain, there's one thing I'll retain, 
A small Violet I 
plucked from Mother's Grave.

There is no drink like the sweet Potheen for me!

Oh, hear the cuck000 cant 
Oh, hear him calling now 
Cuckoo! cuckoo! 
I 
hear you call, I 
hear you Can 
Hear the cuckoo call, 
Oh, hear him calling nowt 
Oh, sadly the cuckoo is calling now, 
I 
hear him far up in the ruins so gray, 
A.nd softly the moonbeams are falling now 
O'er ,slumbering blossoms of May. 
Soft lilies and the rose 
Wave in the valleys green; 
Sad spirits yearn for their lost love. 
While beautiful shamrock grows. 
Oh, sadly the cuckoo is calling now, 
I 
hear him far up in the ruins so gray, 
And softly the moonbeams are falling noV 
O'er slumbering blossoms of May, 
Yhe blue birds do sing with a 
merry trill; 
Their glad notes sound clear thro' the green woodlamm 
bowers, 
But the cuckoo's call is so sad and still, 
It comes in the twilight's lone hours. 
Soft lilies and the roses 
Wave in the valleys green; 
Sad spirits yearn for their lost loys, 
While beautiful shamrock grows. 
Oh, sadly the cuckoo is calling now, 
I 
hear him far up in the ruins so gray,

Three little leaves of Trish green, 
tailed co, , one stela, 
On Irish Soil an often seen--
They toem a 
riah.;ic : rem. 
One leat is truth, and valor, one, 
The other one is love, 
And these three magic leaves are wet 
By dewdrops from above. 
Cnont-s: 
Oh! the shamrock, the shamrock, 
The shamrock immortal and green, 
By every nook and every brook 
Grows shinnrock so green. 
OW do you love, oh! say, you love 
The shamrock, emblem of love, 
Oh! say you love the shamrock so green. 
When Trish soil received the plant 
The Elfin kings can tell; 
Love. Truth and Valor wandered there, 
And liked the soil 
well. 
Each left an embiem in a 
leaf, 
And these tot,ether grew, 
Sustained hy heaven's warmest beams, 
And nurtured by the dew. 
To thee I 
eive the triple leaf, 
As emblem of in 
love; 
I 
only holy- the modest gift 
May not unwelcome prove. 
A 
flower of more pretensions 
Could not more plainly tell 
The triple faith I 
have in thee, 
Thou shamrock of the dell. 
By EnwiN TALBOT. 
In after years when_ you rcall 
The days of pleasure past, 
And think of joyous hours that al 
Have flown away too F; 
If some forgotten air you hear, 
Bring back past scenes to thee, 
And sadly charms thy list'ning ear, 
Keep one kind thought for me. 
In fairer scenes 'midst brighter skies, 
Perchance you still may roam; 
Then your fond heart may warmly prize, 
0 
The, dear old friends at home; 
And mid thy pleasures should a 
sigh 
Unheeded fall from thee; 
While the bright tear-drop seals thine eyv.„, 
Keep one kind thought for me.
