OX-DRIVING SONG
'Twas on the fourteenth of October-o I hitched my team in order-o To drive to the hills of
Saludio. Sing fal de ral to my rudeo.
Chorus:
Sing fal de ral to my rudeo, Sing fal de ral to my rudeo, To my rudeo; to my ridingdo; Fal
de ral to my ridingdo.
I pop my whip; I bring the blood; I make my leaders take the mud. It breaks my heart to
treat them so, But I have to go to Saludio.
When I got there the hills so steep, 'Twould make any tender-hearted person weep To
hear me cuss and pop my whip, And see my oxen pull and slip.
When I get home, I'll have revenge; I'll land my family among my friends; I'll bid farewell to
the whip and line And drive no more in the winter time.
Sung by H.R. Weaver, Merryville, Louisiana, October, 1940.
