Transcript of Interview with Shanda Dunn, July 29, 2020 
By Ethan Sharp 
 
Ethan (00:00:02): 
Just need to make sure this is working. Okay. This is Ethan Sharp, and I'm here with Shanda Dunn. And it 
is July 29th, 2020. We are at Voices of Hope in Lexington, Kentucky. And Shanda, I would like for you to 
get us started with talking about where you were born, where you grew up, a little bit about your 
childhood. 
Shanda (00:00:32): 
So I was born in Lexington, Kentucky, to two parents from two totally different walks of life. I'm biracial. 
So my dad is African-American, and my mom is Caucasian. They met, and I came about. And they got 
married, and they have been together off and on ever since. And I say off and on, because they did have 
a few years that they split up and divorced, and they have remarried. And that's a big part of my story, 
the being biracial along with being from a broken home. And so I always like to say that in the beginning. 
So I grew up in Lexington for the majority, but my heart was always in Casey County, which is where my 
mom's family is from. And I was always really close with my grandma. So I spent my summers in the 
country, where I wanted to be, and then had to come to Lexington for the school year and was here during 
the school year. 
Ethan (00:01:38): 
Casey County, where is that located? 
Shanda (00:01:41): 
Liberty, Kentucky. So it's kind of south. 
Ethan (00:01:46): 
Yeah, I know. I kind of know where it is. All right. And then you went to school here. So did you did all of 
your school years here in Lexington? 
Shanda (00:01:58): 
I did. I went to a Fayette County Public School, all of my schooling, kindergarten through. And I did not 
graduate. I did get my GED, and that's another part of my story that kind of ties in. So, basically throughout 
my childhood, there was a lot of anger bottled up inside of me because of the, you know, the broken 
home. My dad was involved in drug activity. And there were boundary issues with my mom. So she kinda 
treated me like a friend, would talk to me about things she necessarily shouldn't probably talk to your kid 
about involving my dad. So that set up resentment toward my dad at a really early age. And basically, I 
didn't have a really hard childhood, like physically, like I always was fed and I always had, you know, 
somewhere to live and things like that, but there were a lot of emotional issues that were kind of like 
pushed under the rug. Like you don't air your dirty laundry type thing. And so that I think set up a really 
good stage for early onset alcoholism and all the isms that go with it. And so with that, my mom and dad 
separated when he went to jail for trafficking crack cocaine, and they got a divorce. So for a long time, it 
was just my mom and I, because my little sister lived in Casey County with my grandma. And so I had this, 
2 
 
you know, friendship slash mom-daughter relationship with my mom. We were really close. That lasted 
about a year and a half, two years. And then my dad got out of jail and came back home to live with us. 
And so did my little sister. So like in two years, in a very impressionable two years, I want to say the ages 
were like 8 to 10, I didn't have anybody, but my mom. And then all of a sudden here comes a little sister 
and a dad and all these rules and I'm like, whoa. So with that I started rebelling because for one, I felt like 
I lacked attention because I had to share it with two other people and any type of attention was good 
attention. So I started smoking cigarettes at 10, and they were gross. They were nasty, but I felt like I was 
doing something that I could get by with, and you know, I wasn't supposed to be doing it. And then when 
I got caught, it was all about me for a few days. So I started like displaying these isms, like full-blown, really 
early. And at the time, of course, I didn't know what that, what that was. I was just a bad kid, you know, 
that's what I was labeled as. 
Shanda (00:05:06): 
And so that pretty much set a pattern up. It started with smoking cigarettes, then, you know, I sampled 
alcohol. My parents always had alcohol in the house. So they would go out on the weekends, and my 
friends would come over, you know, sixth grade, seventh grade, and we would get in the liquor cabinet. I 
never, at that time, liked the way alcohol tasted, but I liked the effect that it gave me. Hindsight, I see how 
that's a huge warning sign. So into middle school, I experimented with the alcohol, like I said, and then I 
started maybe dabbling in pills. Do you need to say anything right now? 
Ethan (00:05:50): 
You're good. 
Ethan (00:05:50): 
And so once I found that when I combined alcohol and Xanax, it produced a more intensified feeling and 
I didn't have to drink as much alcohol. I was like, I've arrived. Like, this is where it's at. And so I started 
mixing the Xanax, the benzos, and the alcohol pretty early in middle school into eighth grade. I had to 
have this boyfriend for like a year in middle school, and he was like the star of the football team. And so 
I, he partied a lot. The football players partied a lot, and it just basically was like every weekend I was 
partying, into high school. And then high school, I started branching out doing some other things, 
hallucinogens, mainly acid. It was the easiest to get back then. Ecstasy was on the scene really heavy in 
Lexington. So we did that as well, drove to Florida, got jars, did that whole thing. I always lived on this side 
of Lexington from sixth grade on, the Hamburg area. And so I watched that whole development come up 
because we were one of the first neighborhoods. 
Shanda (00:07:03): 
Like I, four-wheeled where Old Navy and all that is. And so, and we still live there to this day. And so I 
made some pretty close friends because that area, typically people move there, and they stay there. So I 
was able to grow up and have the same set of friends. And there were two guys that I was always really 
close with that lived behind me. And when I was 17, I was 17, I kind of slacked off on the pills. I was more 
smoking pot, drinking, doing the ecstasy and stuff like that. I had tried cocaine a couple of times. It really 
wasn't my thing. I don't like snorting stuff. So at 17, I watched my best friend commit suicide. He shot 
himself in the head. It was one of the guys I'd grown up with on the golf course that I was just talking 
about. And that was kind of a turning point for me in my addiction. All those things that kind of maybe 
had laid dormant, like surfaced. And I went through this trauma, and instead of doctors like sending me 
places to, you know, talk about it, give me tools, resources, they stuck me on Xanaxes. So given I've had 
3 
 
this problem with Xanaxes a few years before, and now I've got a prescription for it. So I just kinda like 
took it and ran with it. Like, I could legally take these now. And so that's what I did for the next year or six 
months is just basically just try to stay as obliviated as I could, because I just didn't want to deal. I ended 
up dropping out of high school because of that. There was a lot of questions with peers, you know, I mean, 
something like that happens not very often to a 17 year old. So people wanted to know what happened, 
you know. It was just a lot for me to deal with. And so I made the decision, because I'm pretty good and 
always have been at just telling my parents what I'm going to do, to drop out of high school and go to Job 
Corps. That was what, and this is where it's, I start trying to do geographical things, like I'm running from 
myself, but I don't realize I'm running from myself. And so I go to Job Corps, and by the grace of God, I 
was able to get my GED, because I never stopped smoking weed. And that was a requirement was that 
you pass a drug test in order to stay there. So when I got there, they tested my marijuana levels. It was 
high and it never went down. So after 45 days of being there and me getting my GED, they retested me, 
and my levels had stayed the same. 
Shanda (00:09:53): 
So clearly I had still been smoking marijuana. So I was discharged from job Corps. I went back home and 
that summer is the summer that I met my ex-husband. And when I met him, things went from bad to 
worse. And I say that not because he made me do anything, but because two addictive personalities 
together is a disaster if there's no recovery there. And so I met him, I always like to tease and say this, are 
you from Lexington? Okay. So I met him at McDonald's on Limestone, and he told me he lived with a 
bunch of guys. I thought he was in a fraternity. It was really the Shepherd's House. So he was, I mean, I 
was in love, like he was six years older than me, and you know, all these things were great. And so slowly 
I start seeing things like he's never got any money, but he works all the time. And like, like I'm starting to 
pick up on these things, but I was really sheltered from like the hardcore drug life. Like, I did like the 
suburban kids on the weekend type of thing. But as far as like being in areas where people were smoking 
crack or doing heroin or things like that, it just never was around me. And so after, I got pregnant with my 
first daughter, Alyssa, and all through the pregnancy, I noticed weird things, you know, going on. Only by 
the grace of God was I always able to stop using drugs and alcohol when I've been pregnant. And so I 
wasn't drinking or doing anything. So I had, you know, a little bit clearer mind to see things that were 
going on. Well, had her. And when she was about four weeks, I walked in the bathroom and he was 
smoking crack. And so I was furious. I didn't know at first what it was like, I was like, oh, my God. So then 
two weeks later after he just wouldn't give it up, I was like, I can't beat him, I'm going to join him. So our, 
my first baby is six weeks old. And I tried crack cocaine. That is when my life changed. The first time I did 
it, I was like, I didn't feel anything. I don't know what the hype is. Like, this is stupid. You just spent a 
hundred dollars, and it's nothing. But I'm an addict. So I tried it again the next day, and the next time it 
was like, I just couldn't think of anything else. So I could give you the whole typical story, but just in a 
nutshell, I went from drinking and taking pills to smoking crack daily. 
Shanda (00:12:47): 
I did any and all of the things that you could possibly think of to get that, with the exception of prostitution 
and that's because I was in a relationship and I just couldn't. So I stole, I begged, I borrowed, I pleaded. 
You know, we manipulated family members. We kept our, our kid. So then we can't pay our bills. So our 
first big move together was from Lexington to Casey County because that's my fallback. Like, that's my 
home in my heart and that's, my grandma's there, and she's my enabler, but I know she loves me. So we 
go there, and I get him a job at Tarter Gate Company, which is one of the biggest gate companies in the 
world. And he works. I stay home with Alyssa, and things are good in the beginning. You know, we've, we 
think we've geographically cured an underlying mental disorder, which was not the case. So after about 
4 
 
three or four weeks--it's a dry county, Casey County is a dry County--so after about three or four weeks 
of, you know, doing nothing but really smoking pot, because that's what they do there. Or they did, now 
it's meth. This is in 2002. So we start driving to surrounding counties to get alcohol, and alcohol is my 
fallback. And that's why I say deep down inside, I am an alcoholic because I can always justify a drink. I 
cannot justify going out and smoking crack. There's no justification for it, but I can justify going to a bar 
and having a margarita with my mom, you know, so I am an alcoholic at heart. And so we, we did that for 
a few weeks, but that, wasn't what we wanted. We wanted crack. And so what ended up happening 
toward the end of us living there was that we were driving to Lexington like two or three times a day to 
get crack cocaine. 
Shanda (00:14:55): 
And so that's like $20 plus in gas. And so I'm like, this is crazy. I mean, this isn't working, we're just wasting 
gas. I'm miserable here. I don't have a job. It's not a county that really accepts people of color just yet in 
life. So we had that as well, even though I was never discriminated against because of who my family was, 
the discrimination was there. So we packed up and moved back to Lexington and was still going strong, 
smoking crack. Still had the, had our baby at this point in time. Hadn't lost custody or given custody of her 
up yet. So what happens is I get my first criminal charges of theft by deception. I had wrote cold checks. 
And so we go to, and I've always loved the law, like I've always had a passion for the legal system. And I 
mean to have as many felonies and, and to be, you know, where I'm at today with my criminal record is 
astonishing because of how much I've always loved the law. Like I've always wanted to be a lawyer. I've 
always wanted to, to be somewhere in the legal system. So we came back to Lexington and got a place. I 
got those charges. Went in front of the judge. I think that it was, I was 19 at this time. So I think that the 
judge said 30 days, six months probation. I thought it was the end of the world, 30 days in jail. So I take 
the probation, which of course, I failed my first drug test. And they sent me to the Schwartz Center. So 
now I'm starting my first, my first treatment round. And I go to the Schwartz Center. What I learned at the 
Schwartz Center is that my manipulation this far in life has gotten me places, but now I'm starting to meet 
people that are not convinced with my manipulation. 
Shanda (00:17:05): 
So I go to these classes. I do these things. I have this counselor that I'm one-on-one with. And I'm telling 
Mary every day, "I understand this now, like I get this, I am not going to drink anymore. I just need to leave 
here and take care of my baby. " Like, you know, just the same thing I even hear to this day, you know. 
And so of course her being 40 years into counseling, drug and alcohol counseling, is laughing at me. And 
so by the 22nd day, it was a 28 day program, by the 22nd day of me going in there trying to manipulate 
her into believing that I was not an addict, that I wasn't going to drink, that blah, blah, blah. She's like, 
"I'm going to just let you go home. That's what you want to do." She's like, just, I mean, "I feel like you 
think you have this." So, I literally had my ex-husband, because we're still not married at this time, pick 
me up in the parking lot with cough syrup. That's all he could get a hold of. So like vinegar with codeine 
or something. I don't know. So I was literally intoxicated before I got, you know, out of the town. So now 
he's living in Bourbon County, which is where he's from, because I was in the Schwartz. He didn't have 
where to go, him and the baby had lived in Bourbon County. So we, I go to Bourbon County. So there's 
another geographic cure--well, I just need to get out of Lexington--but we moved right into his hometown 
and his stomping grounds. So I mean, the drugs just kept getting worse and worse. And I mean, people 
would give him free drugs because of who he was. And it just, it wasn't getting any better. 
Shanda (00:18:41): 
5 
 
And so my mom took custody of my daughter, Alyssa, the only daughter I had at the time. And basically 
she said to me, "Either you sign over temporary custody, or I'm going to take you to court, and you're 
gonna have an open case with DCBS, and you don't want that because it's, you can never get out of the 
system." And I'm like okay. So I volunteered, we voluntarily signed Alyssa over to my parents, which was 
probably just a moment of clarity on our part, because you know, that was like probably the safest, 
smartest thing to do for a child that was being strung around Kentucky with active addictive parents. So 
she, that also though set up me and him wide open, we, we were kind of wide open, but we had this baby, 
so it kind of hindered a lot of what we could be doing. But then I knew she was safe. She was with my 
parents. My sister still lived at home then, so I knew my baby was safe. And like, we literally just hit the 
road running. I mean, we went back and forth. I started dabbling in shrooms again, maybe for a month or 
two. And I got pregnant with my second daughter, Brianna, in a hotel. We were living hotel to hotel, doing 
some crazy illegal stuff to get drugs. I got pregnant with Brianna. I went to jail because of those illegal 
activities and was pregnant in jail with Brianna. She was born--no, they sent me to court for shock 
probation, I asked the judge to go to the Chrysalis House because I was pregnant, and of course, that's 
better than jail. So not really at this time wanting to be sober or stay sober or even entertain the thought, 
but I didn't want to be in jail. But see all of these years going in and out of treatments and doing these 
things just to satisfy people, seeds were planted. 
Shanda (00:20:46): 
And I didn't realize that at the time, but like forced treatment may, I'm a firm believer that forced 
treatment may not be what you want, but you will hear something along the way that will help you later. 
So I go to the Chrysalis House, pregnant with Brianna, and I go into premature labor at 20 weeks. I go to 
the hospital. The doctor was like, "If you cough, you're going to deliver this baby." They put me in 
emergency surgery, was able to save her, but I was on bed rest for the rest of the pregnancy. So Chrysalis 
House discharged me, medically discharged me, cause they said I couldn't be there on bed rest. So I spent 
the remainder of my four months pregnant at my parents' house. Not doing anything really, except laying 
on the couch. Had her. I wasn't doing drugs. Literally, as soon as I found out I was pregnant with her, I quit 
doing drugs. Didn't do anything. Had her in October. I had her October the fifth, 16 days later, October 
21st, I got that lurking notion, you know, I've been pregnant, I've been doing good. I'm just going to go 
have a beer. And I ended up in a crack house, and the whole thing just went on, you know, like it had 
never stopped. I picked up exactly where I left off. So I went, so I left her. Got some, some more charges, 
or maybe it was a probation violation, went to jail. She was with my parents along with my oldest 
daughter, Alyssa, and got double pneumonia in her lungs and was in the hospital for several weeks. I was 
in jail through all of this. My parents were there for her. So I, I start--this is 2005--I start brainstorming 
because that's what I'm good at. I'm so good at brainstorming and coming up with these plans and plots 
and twists and ways to get out of things. And so I am like, I need to go the Hope Center, that's what I need 
to do. Why would I not go to the Hope Center? So this was around the time that DOC steps in and starts 
forming the Recovery Kentucky. And it wasn't in full swing. I was among three other girls that were the 
first DOC clients at the women's Hope Center in 2005. So, they let me out of jail again to go to the women's 
Hope Center. I'm starting to see like, they keep letting me out of jail. Like, it's like weird, but I come up 
with these great plans. And so I go to the women's Hope Center, and I hated it. I hated it. You know, they 
told me when I could eat, they told me when to go to bed. 
Shanda (00:23:36): 
They told me all these things that I really had never been used to in life because I've all had always done 
what I wanted to do. Even at home with my parents, I didn't have those rules. And then when I did start 
having rules, I broke them. So I just hated it. And you would think if somebody hated it, like a non-alcoholic 
6 
 
would be like, let's just get through this and get it over with and move on. Not me. I turned a nine month 
program into a 27 month ordeal because I literally would not change my mindset. I would not. I used to 
tell him I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid. So I would not do what they asked me to or what they suggested, 
because I thought I could do this my way. Like I just thought not using was the answer to my addiction. 
And it, and now I know that it's not. 
Shanda (00:24:28): 
So I'm there. I break every rule. I'm restarted four times because I'm a DOC client. Stephanie Raglin invents 
a consequence for me because I've done something heinous, I'm sure. And she sends me to jail for 30 
days. She's like, "Here's what you can do. I can discharge and you can go do your time, or I can send you 
to jail for 30 days, and you can come back and start the program. I've already talked to your probation 
officer." So I'm like okay. That's one thing about me. I'm pretty determined to do stuff. And so when I get 
that push of determination, which has worked in my advantage a lot in addiction. So I was like, yeah, I'll 
go to jail, come back, and start over. So I went and slept for 30 days in jail, came back, started over for the 
last time. So toward the end of this last time at the Hope Center, I was put on no-male contact. The whole 
house was put on no-male contact because I really never had an issue with men or insecurities and 
needing--like I know a lot of people that are in recovery or have struggled with addiction have that 
insecurity, codependency, need for a relationship--that was never my story. I had a whole lot of other 
character defects, but that was not it. So, and I think now that I know that I'm a lesbian, and I really don't 
like guys that much anyway, that might've played a huge part in it. Because I always tried to just do pretty 
much what society, I was trying to save face, you know what I mean? So, the end of the term there, that 
I was there, we, the whole house got put on no-male contact. I, for some reason at this particular time, I 
think honestly, hindsight, they told me I couldn't be around a guy, and I was like, I'll show you. So I got 
pregnant with my youngest daughter on no-male contact by a Hope Center man. So we're both in 
homeless shelters, and I'm pregnant. 
Shanda (00:26:34): 
My oldest two kids' dad was in prison at this time. So we were split up. I met my youngest kid's dad and 
had a baby with him. Got pregnant by him. Left the Hope Center. So even after 27 months, I did not 
complete. I left on my 10th step, because I was pregnant and didn't want to be there. And so my grandma 
who always saves me, sent me $3,000 to pay the restitution, so I could, they would let me leave. That was 
the only thing holding me there. So I left the Hope Center, moved in with this guy that I literally had known 
five minutes, and got pregnant. And we got a house together in Lexington. He was from Frankfort. And 
we, it was never, it never felt right. I never really was in love with him. It was kind of a forced thing. And 
when I say forced, I mean by standards of society, you know, pregnant, blah, blah, blah. So I was never 
really happy, but I stayed sober the whole time I was pregnant with Shylan. As soon as I had her, he started 
selling cocaine. I started selling pills. He screwed over somebody. They broke into our house. It was a huge 
ordeal. All of the news was there. I was on the news because the guy was still in the house when I came 
home. I mean, it was a huge thing. You can Google it. But anyway, so that happened. And then the police 
kicked down our door because he had sold to an informant. And so that happened. I was, I was only on 
the warrant because my name was on the lease. And so, I ended up going to jail. I got immediately bonded 
out. He didn't. So that comes to the end of our relationship. Like I really wasn't in it to begin with, and 
then this happened, and I'm like, I'm just over it. So around October, he's out of jail, we're living together. 
We're fighting constantly. I'm smoking crack all the time. He's smoking crack when he can. And we've got 
this baby, this, that, you know. I don't know what to do with the baby. I've not raised my other two, but 
I'm older. I'm not in my early twenties. At this time, I'm 26. So I'm getting a little bit older and more mature. 
And so we break up, and literally a week later, my ex-husband gets out of jail. And he comes back around, 
7 
 
because we're not oil and water. And he comes back around, and we get, we're like let's get married. 
Cause that's a great idea, right? No, it was a horrible idea. And so in January of 2020, I'm sorry, January of 
2009, we got married. 
Shanda (00:29:25): 
In March of 2009, he went to the penitentiary for 36 months, total, like flat 36 months. And during that 
time I went to jail as well. And when I went to jail, I went to jail because I left the Hope Center. And so I 
had that open warrant. So they arrested me, went to jail. Anytime, I've ever done class D time felony, 
time, I have, I have manipulated my way to Casey County. My cousin's the jailer there. He runs a class D 
facility for women. And so I want to be comfortable in jail. And so pretty much every time, with the 
exception of this last time, I've made it to Casey County. So I get to Casey County, and I I'm like, how can 
I get outta here? I mean, cause that's the first thing an inmate thinks, how can I get outta here? I'm like, 
"I've done the Hope Center. I've done Chrysalis House. I haven't done drug court. I'm going to try drug 
court." So that was, that was the plan. And I ended up getting an assessment for drug court, and drug 
court has saved my life. I got into Fayette County drug court. And at this time in life, I was tired. So I got, I 
was getting tired. I was, I was learning that like, there had to be something else. I didn't know what it was, 
but I knew that people could not live very long doing what I was doing. So little bitty things started 
happening. Drug court, of course, forced me get a job. They, they made me do things that I really didn't 
want to do. But I did it because I didn't want to go to jail. And so doing these things over and over and 
over started making them habit for me. And that's why I say drug court saved my life because I know that 
it's a hard program. I've done it twice now. And, but it's life-saving, is all I can say. And so the first time I 
do drug court was from 2010 until 2012. It was exactly 18 months. The program is designed 18 months. I 
had not one setback, not one sanction, not one missed group, not one missed drop. I did everything to 
the T. At graduation, I left and got high. I didn't use the whole time I was in drug court. So I had all these 
reservations in my mind. My husband had gotten out of jail like six months before I graduated. I was 
entering after-care. He was getting out of prison. So it was just this recipe for just reservations. And, and, 
and so all of this happened. 
Shanda (00:32:12): 
January 20th, I graduate drug court. And that night I relapsed. I'm in school, working three jobs. It was 
just, I was doing too much. So I relapsed. And then for March, from January till March, my ex-husband 
and I were together. It was just miserable for me, miserable for my kids. This whole time, unless I'm in jail, 
I have my youngest kid. So I'll go to jail, and a family member will keep her. I get out, I immediately get 
her back. So she's been drug through the wringer pretty much her whole life. And so he leaves me in the 
middle of the night in March, after I graduated. So I went two months, going strong without him, and he 
just left me. And he's like, I want a divorce. And I was like, at the time, crushed, but hindsight, he did me 
the biggest favor, you know. So we get divorced. And the next few years, I just move around, Casey County. 
I moved to Campbellsville. My daughter went to seven different elementary schools, the youngest one, 
and my oldest two are just pretty much with my parents. I've always been constant in their life. As far as 
like, my parents have never denied me coming there to spend the night with them. Never denied me 
taking them to King's Island. I've always been very active. I wasn't an absent parent, but I was absent 
physically to do things like sports and things that are important to them. So I drag my daughter around. 
We go back and forth with everything after I graduate drug court. Then I go to jail some more. I catch 
some more charges. In Campbellsville, I get possession of forged instrument charges. They give me 
probation. I come to Lexington. I get more charges. Judge Scorsone ordered me to jail. Let me out to go 
to Brighton in Florence. Was there seven months. Left Brighton. There was a warrant out for me, and then 
June. So I was sober 16 months. I met this girl. So this is when I'm like, I hit the fuck-it button. Cause I was, 
8 
 
I was so miserable with myself, and I started seeing through doing some steps in AA and through doing 
some work, forced work that, for one, I liked women. I really wasn't happy with a man. And for two, I 
didn't really ever like my ex-husband. I was just attracted to the drugs. And so I got with this girl in March 
of 2018 and I mean, I thought I was in love. She was a heroin addict. I was sober. I thought I could save 
her. And what happened was I got high before she got sober. 
Shanda (00:34:56): 
So June 28th, 2018, is my sobriety date for one. I took, I got pulled over. I knew I had that warrant for 
leaving Brighton. There were four cops at the scene, all of them out of their car. And I pulled off, I hit the 
cop car. I drug it. I almost killed a cop and took them on a high speed chase throughout Lexington and got 
away from them. And they came and got me the next day. Took me to jail. And this was the first time I 
had ever gotten to jail, and for a brief moment, thought I'm fucked. You know, like I have literally, they 
came and put 10 charges on me on top of the probation violation in Lexington and Taylor County. So I had 
four felony wanton endangerment first on police officers, like all these major charges. And so it was 
overwhelming to me. I was tired. I really couldn't even think at the time. And so, I just was like, I'm just 
going to lay down. So I laid down for the first few months, but I would go to the AA meetings in there, and 
I would listen and I was getting some hope back. And so, you know, I literally had a conversation with 
myself in my head at one point in time and was like, "This is not you. You do not give up. You're not going 
to give up. You can do this. You may be in prison for 10 years, but you're not going to give up." And so I 
started like that fight, like started coming back to me. And so I started coming up with ideas and plans 
cause they had hit me with a PFO one, which is an automatic 10 years. 
Shanda (00:36:44): 
And so I started coming up with plans, and I'm like, I could probably go back to drug court. I'm an alumni. 
And so the drug court staff would come in and out of the jail to see other people that were like sanctioned. 
And I caught Joanne Goods, who was one of the other three girls that were the first DOC clients in the 
Hope Center. We remained friends the whole time. She worked for drug court. And so she came in to see 
somebody. I took her aside, and I said, "Is there an opportunity for me to come back to drug court?" And 
she said, "I'll talk to the director, see what's going on." Because I'm a really friendly person. So throughout 
anything I've done in life, I've been smart enough to know that you don't burn bridges because you don't 
ever know if you have to walk back over them. And so people in drug court loved me. They loved me. And 
so she talked to them, and she came back two weeks later and said, "Shanda, they would take you back, 
but you haven't been out of drug court for 10 years. And our policy is you have to be out for 10 years in 
order to come back." And I said, "I'm not going to accept that as an answer, but okay." And so I just went 
back to my cell, and I prayed. And I was like, you know, "You have brought me so far. I don't feel like you're 
going to let me down." Two weeks later, Joanne came back and they changed the policy. It only had to be 
five years. So that opened the door for me to just keep fighting. Then the obstacle came that my charges 
were not drug court available, like they wouldn't take wanton endangerment first charges because they're 
violent, they're considered violent. So I was like are you kidding me? And so I was like, what can I do? So 
I literally stayed on the phone for two weeks with my attorney and made an appointment to meet with 
the prosecutor all from jail, which is like unheard of, because you can't get nothing done in jail, anything 
done in jail. And so we met with the prosecutor. I laid out a plan of action. "Can you please?" Cause I knew 
the law, "Can you please reword these charges to where I'm still gonna have the same sentence outcome, 
but drug court will acknowledge me and at least give me an interview?" He did it. So he, he took the 
wanton endangerment first to second cause that made me eligible. So I got, I got that taken care of, drug 
court then said, yes, we'll interview her. 
9 
 
Shanda (00:39:03): 
I had three different judges to go through, Campbellsville, Lexington, Scorsone [in] Lexington, and Travis. 
Travis was the judge on my new charges. So I still had a long battle ahead. This all happened in October. I 
didn't get out until March. And so over the next, those next six months, I wrote letters to the judges. I had 
Joanne write a letter about how I was a model participant the last time I was in drug court. My mom wrote 
a letter. My dad wrote a letter. Just people wrote these letters for me, and they really didn't even want 
to accept phone calls from me. But like other people always saw in me what I couldn't see in myself. My 
grandma died a few years before this happened, and that was really hard on me. So I did not have her to 
fall back on. She had always been there to pick me up, and I didn't have that. And so I felt alone, but I had 
these people that really, I didn't deserve for them to do these things because of the things that I had done 
to them. But they believed in me when I didn't believe in myself. And so, they wrote these letters. The 
first judge I went in front of, I got with my attorney and I said, "I know I'm not a lawyer, but I'm going to 
strategically plan this out to where it's going to work in our benefit. We're going to go in front of Scorsone 
first. He's the judge I violated probation with. If we can get him on board, everybody else is gonna follow 
suit." My lawyer, my lawyer was like, okay. So we did that, and Judge Scorsone, I went in front of Judge 
Scorsone, and probation and parole were standing at the podium giving him 15 million reasons why drug 
court was not something that he should give me. He let them finish. He looked at them and said, "I 
appreciate your input, but I'm going to give her a chance." And so I had one judge down. So the next judge 
I had to go in front of was Judge Travis because I couldn't get a transport order until the charges here. So 
we went. This particular week that I went for final sentencing, Judge Travis's dad died. So he wasn't in 
court. And so we went in front of Judge Bunnell. And Judge Bunnell is a stickler. I mean, she's a hardass. 
And so we went in front of Judge Bunnell, and she had all these, you know, 10 new felonies, PFO one, all 
these probation violations in front of her. And she said, "No, I'm not going to give you a chance. You're 
going to go to the penitentiary." And so she went against Judge Scorsone and what he had already 
ordered. 
Shanda (00:41:40): 
And so I pulled my, I like whispered to my attorney, "She's not my judge. I don't have to take that sentence. 
I want to wait for Judge Travis. I want to take my chances in front of Judge Travis." Because I knew that 
because she wasn't my sentencing judge, I had that option. So we waited two more weeks and came back 
in front, and Judge Travis gave me drug court. He went against Judge Bunnell, and she laughed at me and 
said, "I'll let you take your chances with Travis, but he's not going to tell you any different." Well, he did. 
He gave me drug court. And so then I had to go to Taylor County. That was pretty easy. I went there. Two 
Fayette County judges had given it to me. They gave it to me. They let me out. So I'm back into drug court, 
but the things that are different this time are mainly my mindset. I had this new like determination to just 
do what I needed to do to not ever have to go back to that lifestyle. And so that coupled with the fact that 
I was not going to do the same thing I'd always done, which is move into my parents' basement, let 
somebody else take care of me. I needed to get out this time and do everything opposite of what I've 
always done. And that's what I did. So I got out. I did not have a driver's license. I literally rode the bus to 
Tates Creek Road and applied for a position with BHG, Bluegrass Hospitality Group, and got the position 
serving at Malone's in Hamburg. I rode the bus. I literally left my house two hours early every single day 
to get to work on time, did what I needed to do. I still have that job. I work there on Sundays. So I've 
basically taken the opportunity this time. And instead of slapping them in the face, I've like taken it and 
been grateful for it and just done everything, no matter what, because I'm a firm believer in just, you 
know, bring your body and your mind will follow. Like there've been so many days I did not want to get 
up at eight o'clock in the morning to be at work at 10:30. But when I dragged my body to that bus, and I'd 
get on that bus, and I would get there, I would just be like, it's fine, and it's not a big deal. So I've just done 
10 
 
everything different. I haven't picked up. I've worked with a sponsor. I've got sponsees. Drug court was 
able to pay for me to get my peer certification, peer specialist certification. So they had grant money back 
in February, and they paid for me to get this. I took off. I requested a week off from Malone's. They knew 
what I was doing. My work family at Malone's has been really supportive for all this time, you know, the 
whole 16 months I've worked there. 
Ethan (00:44:11): 
Where did you do the training? 
Shanda (00:44:11): 
It was in Lexington through NAMI. David Briggs led it. So this is, BHG is the longest job I've ever held in my 
whole entire life. So I get the certification, then COVID happens. And it made me, you know, not be able 
to work in a restaurant, clearly. And so I was sitting at home just bored. And I know that in my life, for me, 
that when I have a whole bunch of idle time, I start getting antsy. And so I just threw myself into doing 
productive things, like trying to fix my credit, like I called all these people I had owed money to. I was 
cleaning up the wreckage of my past. I was doing all these things that needed to be done to get where I 
wanted to be in life. And so when I started doing that, and that started falling into place. I'm like, what 
else can you do? So I'm like, you have this certification, you know, apply for places. And so I had, there's 
a guy that works here, who I had went through the class with, and he happened to just text me and was 
like, "They're hiring at Voices of Hope. You should apply. You'd be a great fit." And so I did that. They called 
me in. I came in for the interview, mask and all. It was when it was like really crazy. So I had a panel, I had 
two people interview me. We were all in masks. It was the most awkward interview I've ever been in. But 
I prayed before I came in here, it was in this very room. And I came in, and I was honest. And I was just, it 
was the only time I've ever been able to be honest in an interview and just say, "I'm a criminal. I'm a drug 
addict, but I'm in recovery. And my story will help somebody because I believe in this program, like, I 
believe that if you change your mindset, that things fall into place." I believe that. And when there's belief 
so strong and passion behind something, you can, you can make things work. And so I got the job here 
May 26th, and Robert Capley and I had been discussing this, this meeting that we wanted to start for 
multiple reasons. One, we're both gay and two, the community only has one, maybe two other LGBTQ 
meetings, and they're AA. 
Shanda (00:46:36): 
So we also saw the need for a noon meeting. There's only two other new meetings in Lexington, and both 
of them are so full that people have to stand up. So we started brainstorming these ideas. We presented 
it to drug court, drug court said that they thought it was a great idea, but they couldn't figure out a way 
they could make it work. So when I started working here, it was like, I mean, yeah. So I drew up a proposal 
and gave it to my boss. They loved, loved, loved the idea. And so now we're just giving back that way we, 
we started, you know, a week from today, we're going live at noon to talk about, you know, why it's 
important to us. It's important to me because it took recovery for me to finally identify with what sexuality 
I was, and they go hand in hand. And so I'm really passionate that this meeting that we're gonna start 
could definitely be helpful. 
Ethan (00:47:31): 
So you started it last week or-- 
Shanda (00:47:34): 
11 
 
Today, we're going to do a Facebook Live, and we're just going to talk about it and give a little mini lead. 
Yep. And it starts next Wednesday at noon. 
Ethan (00:47:45): 
I'll have to check that out at noon. So let me ask a couple of questions. So you, when you were going 
through maybe drug court this last time, or any other period where you, you know, when you were getting 
treatment, did you work with peers? Did you have that experience of getting, you know, support from a 
peer support specialist? So you kind of knew about it or-- 
Shanda (00:48:09): 
I've sponsored girls, which is very different than peer support. But always in any setting that I've ever been 
in, recovery-wise, people have been drawn to me for reasons like, I can talk to you about things without 
putting AA in it. I can just tell you real life stuff, and I can give you analogies. And I can give you things that 
make your brain just click. And so people have always been drawn to me in that aspect in recovery. So 
that was kind of a driving force. I'm very resourceful. And with being a peer support specialist, you need 
to have resources. I know a lot of people. And so I had never, until I worked here done that, but so here 
I'm able to just utilize all those tools that I have. Like, you know, you call, you know, I have participants, 
one guy who just literally--he's an older man, he's like 62--he came in to me straight out of, you know, 
some sort of halfway house or something, and didn't even know how to turn on a smartphone. So like, 
that was when I first started, and like yesterday, he got a job, and he was so excited. He was like, "I got, I 
got this job. And they sent me an electronic mail." Cause he didn't have, he didn't know how to set up an 
email. And so I was able to like walk him through that whole process. And an outsider may say that has 
nothing to do with recovery, but it has everything to do with recovery. Because if you can't do simple life 
tasks, you're frustrated. If you don't feel like you fit into society because you can't do certain things, you 
want to use. So, I mean, it was just over the past two months to watch him go from not knowing how to 
turn on a smartphone to like answering emails and filling out. 
Shanda (00:50:00): 
Yeah. So it's really rewarding too. And I tell my participants all the time, and they're like, "You, you helped 
me so much." And I'm like, "No, you helped me so much." So I do that with them. I go out and do 
recruitments, which is basically where I'd go out into the community to sober living houses. Currently, 
we're doing Sparrow Health, which is a Suboxone clinic. And so I go, and I tell about our services, and I 
just advocate for the, for the organization. And I let these people know like what we can offer them. And 
it's just, it's like a totally, it's like I get paid to do what I love. 
Ethan (00:50:45): 
When you were in drug court this second time, did you work with Voices of Hope any? 
Shanda (00:50:49): 
I'm still in drug court. I'm in aftercare. 
Ethan (00:50:56): 
Oh, you're in aftercare, but you weren't, you weren't working with a peer support specialist, you know, 
who was counseling you earlier in the process? 
Shanda (00:51:01): 
12 
 
No, I've never personally had a peer support. I've never had that mentorship. I did have a sponsor in AA. 
I did. But I've never, I never even really knew a lot about it until about a year ago. And so well, yeah, I 
heard about them going to do the training. I signed up for it last August, and it didn't happen until 
February. 
Ethan (00:51:30): 
So like, let's, like just a little bit more about like your work. Like, so you, you've talked about some of the 
projects you're working on. What is your daily work life, you know, when you come into the office, you 
have to check in with people in your caseload. How's that? 
Shanda (00:51:51): 
Well, I come in. Nick and I are both half Hazelden, half RCCs, which is recovery coach. So we're 50-50. And 
so with that, we do a lot of communicating. And then of course, we have to run everything by our 
supervisor, which is [inaudible]. Once we run that through her, whatever we're doing, we do--I check my 
email a lot because we get a lot of stuff through email. I have a lot of missed calls. I have a system to 
where I call my participants once a week. 
Ethan (00:52:30): 
You have a certain number of folks? 
Shanda (00:52:33): 
Right now, I have 30 participants that I work with. Some work closer with me than others. Some just want 
to be like, hey, I'm doing good. Or hey, where's an NA meeting tonight. Others, like the gentleman I was 
telling you about, come in every single week, and we just work toward-- 
Ethan (00:52:51): 
You meet one-on-one? 
Shanda (00:52:51): 
Yeah, we go into one of these small little rooms, and we meet, and we do the recovery capital. I've got 
some GPRA's that are set up to do this week, which is like a survey through UK's study for opioids. I just 
basically do whatever they ask me to do as long as it's within my guidelines. I mean, they tell me they're 
struggling finding a job. I'll find felony-friendly positions for them. They tell me they can't find housing. I 
find income-based housing and give them phone numbers. I will not make their calls for them, but I will 
definitely lead them to the well. 
Ethan (00:53:31): 
You know, because it's a new profession, relatively new, we, you know, we just wanted to learn about 
what's the work like for you from day to day. 
Shanda (00:53:42): 
It changes from day to day. 
Ethan (00:53:47): 
Yeah, I just wanted to let you know why I was asking. 
13 
 
Shanda (00:53:48): 
I think eventually with this position, I want to work in the legal system. I mean, I want, I've literally wracked 
my brain-- 
Ethan (00:53:56): 
Voices of Hope does work with folks in drug court? 
Shanda (00:54:00): 
We have drug court participants. We do, but I want to work like directly for drug court. I want to be a peer 
support specialist for drug court. That's a goal. So we literally, we do sober socials. So we basically go out 
in the community when, whenever we can ever do that again. And COVID has put a damper on a lot of 
those things, but like we'll go out and do like cookouts, or you know overdose awareness day at the, at 
the park, at the Jacobson Park. And so we do things like that as well. We do. Sometimes I have to go 
upstairs and do telephone recovery support, which is basically where I just reach out to people that's 
asked to get calls once a week and just to be checked on. And so sometimes I do that. A lot of my job, 
though, is basically just building relationships with people that are on my participant list. So they're 
comfortable enough to say, "Hey, I don't have soap. Is there any way that you could try to help me find 
some soap?" You know, because if you don't feel comfortable saying that to me, I can't be of maximum 
service. 
Ethan (00:55:13): 
Let me just ask, go back a little bit to the LGBTQ meetings that you're working on. So how do you see 
those as different from AA? Maybe I missed that. 
Shanda (00:55:26): 
So the meeting that Robert and I are starting is an All Recovery meeting. And so we don't just box you up, 
like you can only come if you're an alcoholic, you can only come if you're an addict. We want everybody 
to come to our meeting, and our policy and Voices of Hope's policy is you're in recovery when you say 
you're in recovery. So you come to us today, and you come to our meeting, and then tomorrow you have 
a setback--I want you to come next Wednesday. And we're going to, we're going to get through that 
together. You don't have to start your process all over. You had a setback. So there's a lot of different 
things. We don't do the 12 steps in the all recovery meeting, but we do focus on tools and plans of action. 
We do go around, and we talk about our week, just like you would, you know, you introduce yourself, "I'm 
Shanda, I'm addicted to alcohol," or whatever. And you know, at the end of the meeting, instead of praying 
out, we all go around and say an affirmation about herself. So it's kind of the same, but a lot different. 
Ethan (00:56:31): 
You still use the twelve steps a little bit? 
Shanda (00:56:34): 
We do not do the 12 steps. All Recovery is a system that Voices uses. They do not do 12-step based. It's 
just basically a self-help group. 
Ethan (00:56:48): 
14 
 
I see. And again, some of this is for our listeners, so why a separate meeting for LGBTQ folks? Why, why 
is that important? 
Shanda (00:57:03): 
Well, like I said before, it took me going through recovery to, to grasp who I was, and you can come to the 
meeting, you just need to be, you know, friendly with the gay community. 
Ethan (00:57:19): 
An ally. 
Shanda (00:57:19): 
Yes. So we decided to do that. Robert and myself both are gay. So we decided that we needed to try to 
create something to where that community would feel comfortable coming in. Because I know sometimes 
you cannot feel comfortable in your own skin. And so we wanted to open our doors to that community to 
say, hey, you all can recover too. Come. Come, let's recover together. 
Ethan (00:57:52): 
That's awesome. Well, I did want to ask one other thing. Well, there's a couple of other things I wanted 
to ask about. How are you on time? Do you have 10 minutes? Do you want to take a break now? So I did 
want to ask, so, you know, you did have a little bit of, you had experience, you know, going back a few 
years with treatment, how have you seen treatment options change? How have you seen the recovery 
support change, you know, in these past 10, 15 years. Have you seen, have you seen any changes? 
Shanda (00:58:28): 
Absolutely. And that's another thing that I will eventually tackle. I think a lot of the treatment facilities 
that are beneficial to people, such as peer-driven communities, have turned into be more about money 
than about helping people. I know when I went through the Hope Center in 2005. I felt the love. I felt like 
people genuinely cared if I went out and had a set back the next day, but not, I don't get that so much 
now. Now that DOC has come in and taken over, and they've got all these, you know, this, how much ever 
money you get per inmate you take or whatever it is. I feel like the lines have been blurred. Like you're 
missing what this place is about. It's not about how many beds you can fit because of the revenue. It's 
about how many people that you can save from dying. 
Shanda (00:59:33): 
And so when you, when you complicate things with money, I think it ruins what it could be. And so that's 
where I'm at with it. I just, I wish that, I think in the early two thousands, that recovery in treatment 
facilities were good, because I feel like people, it was like kind of new, not really new, but they were taking 
it off and these things were happening and great things were happening. But just like everything else, 
money came along, and kind of sorted it. So that's my opinion. I think that it's changed. Not for the better. 
I think that in numbers, more people are being reached, but the more people that you try to reach, they 
become just a number and not a person. And so you kind of take away the personal. 
Ethan (01:00:23): 
15 
 
I can see that. But what about when you're working with, you know, folks here at Voices of Hope, how do 
you bring up your story? How does your story come out with, you know, where you're relating to people? 
How's that a point of connection for you? 
Shanda (01:00:44): 
I'm constantly giving like mini leads, especially at recruitments. I'll take like 10 minutes to tell them who I 
am, because I think it's important to build that relationship, and let people know I'm not just an employee 
coming to talk to you. Like I've been where you've been. I've been in sober living. I've been in treatments. 
I'm a felon. I want to say these things that will connect with them. So I'm put, I'm on their level. And so 
every opportunity I get, I try to insert things that can help us connect. And like today, Robert and I are 
going to do the mini leads at noon, just to try to let the community know who we are, so it may bring 
them in. I still, when AA asked me, I go out into the community and give my lead. I just gave a lead Saturday 
night at the women's Hope Center. So anytime I'm asked to speak, I do, because I never know when 
something in my story is going to help someone. 
Ethan (01:01:43): 
What does my lead mean? I'm sorry. 
Shanda (01:01:43): 
So basically you just go, and it's an AA meeting. And for an hour, you give your story, basically what I just 
did except more in depth and more graphic. So it takes about an hour. It takes, it takes an hour. It took an 
hour Saturday night. 
Ethan (01:02:03): 
Wow. Okay. But you know, like if someone, when you're talking to somebody on the phone, you're 
checking in with them, do you ever, do you talk about your experience, you know? 
Shanda (01:02:18): 
Yeah. And so when they're asking for resources, sometimes I can say, "Well, when I was looking for a 
place, and I was, had no credit and I," you know. I can definitely insert things like that. But then also like 
sometimes our sessions last for 40 minutes, sometimes an hour. We, you know, we go back and forth--
they tell me something that they've done, and I can say, I did that, and this is what helped me.  
Ethan (01:02:44): 
Yeah. Well, there's a couple of other things here, but I think we do need to ask about like, sort of where 
you see the profession going? What are some challenges maybe you see with peer support specialists 
going forward and things that need to be dealt with? I don't know if that's something that you've thought 
about. 
Shanda (01:03:11): 
I mean, yeah, I guess. I always have ideas. I think that there's room for improvement. I think that-- 
Ethan (01:03:20): 
Is there a particular challenge-- 
16 
 
Shanda (01:03:26): 
I understand and I respect the fact that we cannot confuse sponsorship and peer support, but I think there 
needs to be a happy medium, because a lot of my participants don't even have sponsors yet. So for them 
to call me, and you know, wat for an hour to talk about Bill's story in the AA book, or want to talk about, 
"I'm not really for sure about this higher power thing." So I think maybe tweaking that particular part of it 
in the long run would be beneficial. Like saying, "No, you can't drop a four-step with the participant. 
However, you can do a handout and go over what step one actually is meant to be like." So that I think 
should maybe be talked about. But as far as the profession-- 
Ethan (01:04:17): 
You would like to see the possibility of doing an inventory as a peer support specialist? 
Shanda (01:04:22): 
No, I don't want to do an inventory with them. I want more clear-cut. Like I want, I want to be able to, if 
they choose the steps as their pathway to recovery, I want to be able to talk to them about that. I want 
to be able for them to say, what did, what exactly does it mean come to believe? So I want to be able to 
say to them, you know, "You have these moments of clarity, think about them. Is that, do you think that's 
what you've done, or do you think that's what a higher power has done?" I want like to be able to discuss 
their, their steps if that's what they want to do. Also we're really limited at kind of what we can do. I think 
that it sometimes can be blurred like what our expectations are, as opposed to what we're asked to be 
done as to what we can do, because we're limited with resources, does that make sense? So I mean, I 
think that this is a great, it's going to be a great profession once it's ironed out. 
Ethan (01:05:29): 
Yeah. Of course. There's lots of challenges with it being new. Well, here's one last thing: you had, you 
know, you had just mentioned, sort of your realization that there was an underlying illness or mental 
disorder, I think is the term you used, so what was that process like of, you know, understanding the 
illness? 
Shanda (01:06:00): 
I can get what you're saying. It just took a lot of unwanted treatment. It took a lot of unwanted exposure 
to people who had the experience that I now have, that I can transmit to other people. It took people 
saying to me, saying things to me, like, "If you can just not drink, why don't you just not drink? If you can 
just have one, show me that you can just have one." It took them showing me the flaws in my thinking, in 
order for me to start accepting that I had flaws in thinking, you know. It took them pointing out to me 
how manipulative I was and controlling because I just thought I was a good leader. You know, I didn't think 
I was controlling. So it took constant people, constant-- Joanne Goods. I talked about her. She wouldn't 
care if I said her name. She's the lady that's does drug court. She has been a major influence in my life 
because like I said, she came into SOS at the Hope Center on the same day as I did. And she stayed sober 
this whole time. So, so having people like that in my life that have been constant with this, constantly 
working against their character defects, constantly changing their thinking process, watching the growth 
in them, watching the things that have happened in their life over the years, has been tremendous for 
me. So I want to be that person to someone--I want to be, be able, cause a lot of people in addiction want 
to work in recovery. And so I want to be that light. I want to be that person that can say, "This is where I 
was. And look, this is where I am now. And this is the work I did to get there."

Ethan (01:07:51): 
Oh, that's great. Well, is there anything else that we should talk about? Okay, well, I appreciate it. 
Shanda (01:08:00): 
No problem. 
Ethan (01:08:05): 
Yeah. Thank you. 
Shanda (01:08:06): 
You're so welcome. 
Ethan (01:08:08): 
It's is a busy day for you because of the thing that you've got going on today. 
Shanda (01:08:13): 
I can never just chill out. My fiance--oh yeah, I got engaged, I forgot to mention that--my fiance says it's 
my fault, it's troubles of my own making because I overbook myself. It was really nice to meet you. 
Ethan (01:08:30): 
Thank you so much. 
Shanda (01:08:30): 
You're so welcome. I would shake your hand, but COVID--do you need help getting out? 
Ethan (01:08:34): 
Oh no, I'll put this away and I'll, I'll head up. Thank you so much.
