POOR LITTLE JOE. 
Sung with great success by JOHNNY GIBBONS
'. 
While strolling one night through New York's gay throng, 
I 
met a 
poor boy, he was singing a 
song, 
Although lie was singing, he wanted for bread, 
And though he was smiling, he wished himself dead: 
I 
spoke to this poor boy, out in the snow, 
He had no home to shelter him, no place to go, 
No mother to guide him, in the grave she is low, 
Cast on the cold street was poor little Joe. 
CHOR1JS. 
Cold blew the blast, down came the snow, 
He had no place to shelter him, no place to go ; 
No mother to guide him, in the grave she is low; 
Cast on the cold street is poor little Joe. 
A 
carriage passed by with a 
lady inside, 
I 
looked on poor Joe's face, and saw that be cried; 
He followed the carriage, she not even smiled 
But fondly oarressing her own darling child. 
I 
looked on this waif, I 
thought it was odd, 
Is this poor ragged urchin forgotten by God ? 
And I 
saw by the lamp light that shone on the snow, 
The pale, deadly features of poor little Joe. 
Cold blew the blast, etc. 
The light had, gone out, the clock had struck one, 
Along came a 
policeman, whose duty was done; 
I 
could tell by the sound of hisi. dull, heavy tread, 
You'd think he was sinking the graves of the dead. 
Oh ! what is this ? the policeman he said, 
It was poor little Joe, on the ground he lay dead. 
With his eyes turned to Heaven, covered with snow. 
Died in the cold street, did poor little Joe. 
Cold blew the blast, etc.

MIGHTY DAY. 
Words and Music by CHAS. H. 
SHEFFER. 
Sung by FOLEY & SHEFFER, with immense succeu. 
As I 
was a-crossing yonder field, 
A 
snake he stung me on the heel; 
Turned right around to do our best, 
Slapped our foot in a 
hornet's nest. 
CHORUS. 
Wasn't that a 
mighty day, 
Wasn't that a 
mighty day, little children; 
Wasn't that a 
mighty day, 
When us two Digs were born. 
What kind of shoes does the angels wear ? 
They don't wear any, for they walk in the air; 
They walk in the air until somebody knocks, 
Then we put all the niggers in the missionary 
box. 
CHORUS. 
Wasn't that a 
mighty day, 
Wasn't that a 
mighty day, little children ; 
Wasn't that a 
raIghty day, 
When us two nigs were born. 
Written by W ELCH AND RICE. 
My child you must keep still, 
Don't tease you mamma so; 
Oh, mother, dear, I 
will, 
It's wrong to tease, I 
know. 
Now, be a 
good little boy, 
That wood right home you'll bring, 
shout aloud with joy, 
• 
Sing, my child, now sing. 
CHORUS. 
Don't get weary; 
Don't get weary, children, 
Don't get weary, 
For we're going home. 
Oh, mother, I 
will be good, 
And try and do what's right, 
I'll always come home soon, 
And won't stay out at night. 
Now that's the way to talk, 
In fine or rainy weather, 
Oh, now let's take a 
walk, 
And joyous sing together. 
Don't get weary, etc.

MANY CAN HELP ONE. 
As sung by A. S. TALBOTT. 
Some very good sayings I've heard in my time, 
And some I 
believe to be true ; 
The one I 
will mention to night in my song 
Is one that is well known to you; 
If you meet a 
man who is down in the world, 
And assistance you can't give him any, 
Remember that many can always help one, 
Where one cannot al ways help many. 
CHORUS. 
Then give what you can to those in distress, 
Let it be a 
dime or a 
penny, 
For many can help one, I've heard people say, 
Where one cannot always help many. 
How often a 
trifle would save a 
man's life 
When he is near dying from want; 
He's tried to live honest all through his lifetime, 
But finds in the end that he can't; 
At last he is tempted to steal or to starve, 
his nch friends they all pass him by, 
They heed not his wishes, they care not his wants, 
He's left like a 
dog there to die. 
Then give what you can, etc. 
A man may be wealthy one end of the year, 
The next one be wretched and poor; 
He's struggled his hardest to keep himself up 
But has sunk down to poverty's door; 
Such men as these deserve your support, 
So give it to them who most need, 
For those who've experenced poverty know 
'Tis a 
very hard battle indeed. 
- Then give what you can, etc 
I 
hope what I've mentioned to-night in my song, 
That nothing I've said out of place ; 
A man may be poor, but still honest be. 
For poverty, ' tis no disgrace ; 
Then give what you can with a 
generous heart, 
No knowing when the tide it may tnrn; 
'rust give him a 
chance to rise up in the world, 
And your kindness he's sure to return. 
Then give what you can, etg

THE MANIA MONIA NIGS. 
Published by permission of JOHNSON & BRUNO. 
Written expressly by Mit. HERRON, for JOHNSON & BRUNO. 
THEY say that we are mad—perhaps it's se— 
But we never could tell the reason why 
We like to rock upon the heel and toe ; 
And sling these number tens away, so high. 
We were born among the cotton and the cane, 
And the Mania Monia Niggers is our name. 
Our hearts are always glad, and of course v,e're 
never sad— 
But everybody tells us that we're mad. 
Oh ! you couldn't keep us still if you should try, 
For we are de wildest darkies in de town 
We're lively as de lightning iii de sky, 
Our daddy says he'll have to nail us down. 
Oh! give us room according to our size, 
We're sure to make you open wide your eyes, 
Our hearts are always glad, anti of course we're 
never sad— 
nut everybody tells us that we're mad.

I'm gwine to see Maria Jane, 
Back of de woods and down de lane, 
A

Eyes so bright, they' shine at night, 
Dressed to death and out of sight, 
There's style about Maria Jane; 
That's what the people say. 
ClIoRUS. 
Going to see Maria Jane, 
Back of de woods and down de lane, 
Turn a 
flip and give me de slip, 
Stab me with a 
sugar cane; 
I'm out of breath and tickled to death, 
About Maria Jane. 
I'd travel through the wind and rain, 
To see my sweet Maria Jane, 
Sweet as 'lasses candy, or honey in the comb, 
Bless her heart, oh ! ain't she nice, 
It's getting so hot I 
want some ice, 
I'm going to marry Maria Jane, 
And get a 
little home.

A 
light-weight of sixteen, 
Wid hair where warmest colors -blaze, 
And heart where truth do beam; 
She have a 
cheek where freshness dwells, 
She'd spoil up any man, 
A lump of carrot gold is she, 
This little Maggie Ann. 
CHORUS. 
This little Maggie Ann, this rosy Maggie Ann, 
She'd strike you blindidumb, this sweet little plum, 
This slick and entirely bewilderin' young girl, 
They call little Maggie Ann. 
This rosy Maggie Ann, a 
Vaynus is she, 
Whate'er that may be, is little Maggie Atm. 
She used to be a 
workingman. 
Down in a 
laundry fine, 
And wrestle wid discouraged shirts, 
'Till wid new life they'd shine; 
But she bekem hightoney, 
As would any other man, 
And now a 
rale, pure Irish nurse 
Is little Maggie Ann. 
This little Maggie Ann, etc. - 
The babies all she wastes, 
And then irons them out well, 
And fetches them a 
lovely slap, 
If out of tune they yell; 
A 
fancy night-cap then she wears, 
This French Hibernian, 
Then to the Park wid all the babes 
Glides little Maggie Ann.

We joined the Yankee army, 
And went away to the war, 
To be penetrated by cannon balls, 
And carry many a 
scar, 
When we went out we were so stout, 
Led on by Sergeant Quinn, 
We've come home all skin and bone, 
We'd drop if ye'd say fall in; 
There's MoClinchy and McGowan, 
MeSwegan and McFudd, 
McDermott and McLaughlin, 
All men of royal blood, 
O'Brien and O'Leary, 
And twenty thousand more, 
We represent the sickest galoots, 
In the regular Invalid corps. 
CHORUS. 
Thin fall in for your castor oil, 
Before you go to bed, 
For if you're sick the (Evil a 
kick 
You'd make whenever you're dead; 
For every pill will surely kill, 
That they put in your jaw, 
If you lose a 
leg the devil a 
peg 
You'd get in the Invalid corps.

To try to get up mixed up wid mud, 
They give us so us well, 
And if we drank a 
drop of it, 
.),.A 
We'd never live to tell. 
„ 
They give us bread that's always tread, 
Down under horses' feet, 
As a 
general rule it's army mules 
They give to us for meat, 
With fever and ague and cholera-cramp, 
An' the barber's itch. 
They throw us in an ambulance, 
Or else into a 
ditch, 
The eagle and crow, and buzzard you know, 
Fly down an' give us the claw, 
They'd eat us up, till a 
divil a 
sup, 
Is left of the Invalid corps. 
Thin fall in for your castor oil, etc. 
Napoleon was a 
soger, 
And the Duke of Wellington, too, 
A hundred thousand million men, 
All in the war they slew ; 
They'd never left a 
cripple, 
Whenever they fought the Dutch, 
They'd cut off their heads when they shoot 'em dead, 
So they never would need a 
crutch. 
But over here when you lose an ear, 
They order you behind, 
And the pension that they give to you, 
Is an Italian organ to grind; 
To sit out on the corner, 
An' play, " Willie Come Home from the War," 
The divel a 
cent from the Government 
You'll get in the Invalid corps. 
Thin fall in for your castor oil, etc.

But I

So watch dis old coon and his son. 
HOTEL DE VARSELAY: 
By ED. HARRIGAN. 
Sung by all the Eastern-bound Fleweys' 
I'm living at a 
boarding-house 
Up.in Houston street, 
Where actors and musicians 
Eat their meals and sleep. 
There the hungry ballet tramp 
That come from Marcela 
Dancing Danish polkas 
In the Hotel Varselay. 
CHORUS. 
All night I 
am uneasy, 
No sleep at all I 
get, 
\Yid bones and clappers rattling 
And a 
Prussian clarionet. 
They never talk in English, 
But parley -vous Prancay,. 
I'll lose my life, upon my soul, 
In the Hotel Varselay. 
When we sat down to breakfast, 
It's Cully, pass me that, 
Or nixy Weedy, Nibzy, 
Stag the tad wid the dizzy hat. 
They have a.soup called bullion, 
The butter runs away, 
The boarders holler out for dates, 
In the Hotel Varselay. 
All night I 
am, etc. 
HOTEL DE VARSELAY. 
(Concluded.) 
The other night I 
tried to sleep, 
When a 
man from Calumet 
Came down through the ceiling 
Turning a 
suramerset. 
I 
grabbed him by his necktie, 
He " Hay Rube! hay Rube!" did say, 
I 
was kicked by a 
circus company 
From the Hotel Varselay. 
All night I 
am, etc. 
I 
went up stairs to get my trunks, 
And have revenge or die, 
When a 
man they called a 
tumbler 
Said " Shoot him—kill the guy." 
I 
drew a 
knife and grabbed my trunk, 
The French said " Allecushay," 
My trunk was nailed unto the floor 
In the Hotel Varselay. 
BUFFALO. 
Written and sung by ED. HARRIGAN. 
FROM Buffalo I've just come down 
On the good boat Danger; 
A 
long, long trip on the Erie, boys,

We'd heavy fogs, aaf wind storms, 
Forget 'em I 
never shall ; 
I'm every inch a 
sailor boy, 
On the E-ri-a Canal. 
CHORUS. 
For the Erie is a 
rising, 
And the gin is getting low ; 
I 
hardly think you'll get a 
drink, 
Till we go back to Buffalo. 
We were loaded down with barley, 
When we bid good-bye; 
When a 
pirate bore upon us, 
With an awful wicked eye. 
I 
saw him through the spy-glass, 
I 
put up a 
flag of truce; 
I 
found it was the Three Sisters, 
Four days from Syracuse. 
For the Erie, etc. 
Three'days out we struck a 
rock, 
Of Lackawanna coal ; 
It gave the boat an awful shock, 
And stove iu quite a 
hole. 
I 
balloed to the driver, 
On the tow-path's treaden dirt; 
He came aboard and stopped the leak, 
With his flannel undershirt. 
For the Erie,etc. 
BUFFALO 
(Concluded.) 
In two years we reached the Hudeon,' 
We hadn't slept a 
wink; 
The crew mutinized 
Because I 
refused to drink 
Keep up your courage, then I 
cried, 
I'll bring you safely in; 
Aud when we strike a 
grocery store, 
We'll swim in barrels of gin. 
For the Erie, etc. 
The storm went down, we went ashore, 
Me and Sal and Hank; 
Greased ourselves with tallow-fat,. 
And slid out on a 
plank. 
Sal is in the Poor House, boys, 
The crew are all in jail ; 
I'm the only sole surviving moke, 
Left to tell the tale. 
5roamt.—So haul in your bow-line, 
Stand by your sorrel mule, 
Low bridge, boys, dodge your heads 
Don't act just like a 
fool.

A 'prentice I

And went to swiping handkerchiefs 
Not many miles from home.

slipped the gaol with a

And sailed from Botany Bay.

A PATHETIC SKETCH. 
TWO CHARACTERS. 
By 
GER. FALCON. 
DRAMATIS PERSON2E. 
TEDDIE, an exile. 
DAN, his brother. 
SCENE. — Rural view on flat ;—set cottage B. humble 
but picturesque—Rustic stile 
E. U. E. practicable. 
Old fashioned arm-chair near cottage door. 
Plaintive music—" Exile of Erin." 
(Enter Dan from cottage, slowly and sorrowfully— 
wiping his eyes. 
Dan—For the soul o' me I 
could stand it no longer. 
It was twistin' and tearin' my dear life strings to look 
upon their partin' and listen to the heart sobs of our 
poor old sick mother over the pride of her old age 
her—(with emotion as he drops into arm-chair) 
lavin' her—God help us, and likely niver to bless her 
failin' sight again this side the grave. 
Oh, sorrow of 
fortune that such sad partin's must be! that the 
Heaven they call so kind should see fit to be so cruel. 
(Enter Teddie from the cottage, hastily and agitated-
ly. 
Teddie— "..
eproachfully) Dan! Dan, my brother, 
what ill words is it 
that I hear abuse your honest 
tongue? 
Dan—If my words are ill, Teddie, they are born of 
sore-hearted sorrow, 
Teddie—Dan—dear Dan, sorrow comes to all in one 
shape or another—to gentle and simple—rich and 
poor alike. 
Let us be strong and bear our share like 
men. 
29 
FAREWELL TO IRELAND. 
(Continued.) 
Dan—(bitterly) Be strong! 
Ah, Teddie, Teddie, it 
is aisy for us in the morning of manhood to boast of 
being strong. 
But think of her (
pointing to cottage) 
that you've just left in anguish, whose poor old heart 
will be stretchin' out to you across the broad ocean 
while her tremblin' form is totterin' to her last low 
restin' place on the green hill side. 
Who, Teddie, 
who will make her strong to bear it? 
Where will she 
look for strength? 
Teddie—(uncovering and raising his hands and eyes 
reverently). 7/mere, Dan, there! Upbraid not in this our 
time of trouble; (Dan, impressed, rises, uncovers and 
bends his head) the only Friend and Helper we can 
look to—the One to whom our poor old mother looks 
for strength to stand the trials of her old days—God 
guard her. 
Think, Dan, think how many a 
time she 
has sat in that old chair from which you've risen and 
spoke of Him to us and taught us to worship Him in 
his works—the bright blue sky and the golden sun-
light and the heathered hills and bright green valleys. 
Dan—( 
falling on Teddie's shoulder with emotion) 
Oh, Teddie, darlin', that's what's crushin' the heart 
' 
within me. To think of the times when she'll ask to 
be carried and seated in this same old chair to sit and 
gaze wearily, drearily, not at the green hills of Ire-
land, God bless them, but beyond them—away far 
away—to the blue sky that caps the forests of Amer-
ca where her brave boy, Teddie— 
Teddie—(interrupting him with much emotion) 
Enough, Dan, cease or you'll drive every ha'porth of 
my bravery away and make a woman of me. 
It is 
our fate to part for the present—mind me now, only 
for the present—and we must put up with it as best 
we may. 
may. 
What can't be cured must be endured. Let 
us make the best of the hardship, Dan, I 
have my duty 
to do abroad and you have yours at home. 
Let us 
keep heart and do it.

FAREWELL TO IRELAND. 
(Continued.) 
Dan—(shake hands warmly) Heaven helping me, I 
will. 
Teddie—My own true-hearted brother, to you with 
the full trust of my soul I 
leave our mother and Patsy. 
Do you care for and comfort them in Ireland, and 
fight the fight of fortune for us all in free America. 
Dan—Our prayers and blessing will follow you. 
Teddie—And now, Dan, ma bouchal, the sorry mo-
ment has come, and the sad, sad word " good bye" 
must be passed between us.

Pointing. off over stile) 
See, the carman is waiting at the rise of the road and 
beheadin' the thistles with his whip out o' sheer im-
patience—and—now—

inevitable moment. 
He turns suddenly and holds out 
his hand silently.

They rush into each other's arms. 
Dan—Teddie! 
Teddie—Dan ?

Dan—Oh, my brother, has the dark hour come at 
last? 
Teddie—Look through the darkness, Dan, dear, for 
the light sure to shine in the future. 
I must away. 
God bless you, Dan. 
(
Embrace.) 
Dan—I 
will go with you a 
bit. 
Teddie—No, not a 
foot, Dan. 
Your place is there. 
(pointing to cottage) See to her, God bless her. 
Kiss 
her for me, Dan, darlin', I 
daren't go back agin—it 
would unman me. 
Dan—Hard as it is, Teddie, it's better not. 
She's 
overwrought with grief already—more might be the 
death of her. 
Teddie—t 'eelingly) Good angels guard her lovingly 
when I 
am gone. 
Poor soul in the far strange land, 
I'll often think of her last small request that I 
could 
not comply with—could only refuse her. 
Dan—What was it, Teddie? 
Teddie—(in low tone) Whether or not it was the.

sickness and trouble that crazed her and made her 
rave I 
don't know—but what do you think? 
Dan—Speak, man. 
Teddie—She asked me to sing one more song for her 
before I 
went. 
Dan—Ravin' or not ravin', Teddie, it was your 
poor old mother's wish, perhaps her last, and why 
wouldn't you humor her? 
Teddie—Shure the grief was chokin' me, and for 
my soul's sake I 
couldn't raise a 
note. 
Dan—Thry it now. 
It will warm her heart to hear 
your voice once more. 
But, hark ye, Teddie' let 
there be more about hope in the future in what you 
sing than of the present sorrow. 
Teddie—Help me to bear out your idea.

DAN AND TEDDIE'S PARTING. 
By C. R. Dockstader. 
Teddie--I am bidding you good-bye, Dan dear, 
I 
am going far away, 
I'm leaving Ireland far behind, 
Going to America; 
Then you be good to mother, Dan, 
And little Patsy, too, 
I'll get work in America, 
And send for all of you. 
• CHORUS. 
Teddie—Good-bye, Daniel dear, 
Dan— 
Teddie are you leaving? 
Teddie—Let your heart be of good cheer, 
And try not to be grieving. 
Bear this parting like a 
man, 
Dan— 
Teddie, I 
will try, 
Teddie—Good-bye, Daniel! 
Dan— 
Farewell, Teddie! 
Both— Daniel!—Ted!—Good--bye!

FAREWELL TO IRELAND. 
(Concluded.) 
Dan— Our home will be a 
sad one, 
Whin you have gone away, 
And we'll watch until a 
letter 
Comes across the sea. 
And mother says her prayer shall be 
God speed her own son Ted, 
Yes, you'll be always in our minds 
Each day we break our bread. 
Good-bye, etc. 
Teddie—So now I 
must be leaving you, 
But, oh, it won't be long, 
I'll save up every cent I 
earn, 
For I 
am young and strong; 
And when I 
reach America 
I'll soon be sending home, 
The money for my brother Dan 
To come across the foam. 
Good-bye, etc. 
During last stanza and chorus they embrace and 
part.

feel so lazy and thick; 
When the old woman saw a

OH! hear I 
am an active gal, 
The folks all call me Saucy Sal, 
The beds I 
make the floor I 
scrub, 
For a 
dollar a 
week and all my grub, 
And if a 
dish I 
even take, 
You may be sure is going to break, 
My mother says she always shall, 
Teach me to be an active gal. 
Oh! I 
can dance, and I 
can sing, 
And I 
can cut a 
pigeon wing, 
And when my work it is all done, 
Why then my pleasures just begun, 
Or if the folks where ere I 
be, 
Do wish to be amused by me, 
The're treated to a 
simple rig, 
For I 
can do an Irish jig. 
I 
alsr.:.ys go to every show, 
To see what I 
can learn you know, 
And when I 
do get home at night, 
The steps I 
try with all my might, 
And when I 
get them down all right, 
To do them here is my delight, 
The last I 
saw Ill show to you, 
Nickademus Johnson I 
can do. 
And now white folks if one you see, 
Wants such an active girl like me, 
I'll cook and wash, bake, iron, and scrub, 
For a 
dollar a 
week and all my grub, 
And if you like this sort of thing, 
To-morrow night your friends all bring, 
And I 
will try and please then' sure, 
So now II finish with the cure. 
Sung by Miss liAGGIE FIELDING 
YOUNG 
ladies tarry, think e'er you marry, 
A 
lesson pray take from that I 
sing, 
For though black slaves are of course unknown here, 
We wives you'll find are the slaves of the ring, 
Our husbands nightly, most unpolitely 
With their companions abroad will roam, 
Of us ne'er thinking, they go off drinking, 
While we are crying our eyes out at home. 
CHORUS. 
Think, think, how slowly the moments pass, 
While you're enjoying your pipe and glass, 
Think, think how slowly the moments pass, 
Now gentlemen pray mind what I 
say, 
And look, look at the clock. 
Now thus to leave us, and so deceive us, 
I'm sure you'll own is a 
monstrous sin, 
For there's no knowing where you are going, 
Or what bad company you may get in, 
For when you tell, deceitful fellows, 
That at your club you have passed the night, 
At that casino you're often seen oh, 
You must acknowledge now that is not right, 
Think, think, cte. 
Then when returning we're soon discerning, 
That in your manner there's something queer, 
You whisper Salmon but that's all gammon, 
It's something stronger than that I 
fear, 
It must be really, for when awaking, 
A 
noise you're making for a 
cup of tea, 
You didn't ought to want Soda water, 
Through eating Salmon you must agree, 
Think, think, 
The cradle rocking or mending stockings, 
The time we strive hard to pass away, 
While you are flirting your health too hurtinz, 
By stopping out till the break of day; 
Besides suspicions will sometimes enter our heads, 
While sitting up waiting alone, 
About your latch keys for who's to know, pray, 
What doors they open besides your own. 
Think, think, ac.

NEVER LOSE YOUR GRIP, 
As sung 
by LARRY Toousr. 
15 through the world in search of pleasure, 
We wander boys together, 
We're knocked about, up and down, but 
The storm of life we weather, 
Some there are who don't succeed, and but 
And let their chances slip, 
lake my advice, you'll find I'm right, 
Boys never lose your grip. 
When courting be the man throughout, 
And if your girls inclined 
To act the flirt, why shut your eyes, 
Her little faults don't mind, 
Don't act the fool, be true to her, and 
Dar a 
it, let her rip, 
If she cares a 
cent for you, my boy, 
You'll never lose your grip. 
When you meet a 
skunk, pass him by, but 
Remember at some time, 
That to be hard up, is no sin, and poverty no crime, 
And when a 
friend is in distress, why 
Your hands in pocket dip, 
And until you find a 
stamp my boy, 
Why never lose your grip. 
When going home late at night, 
Look out for an attack, 
It happens oft a 
loafer steals like, O. 
Sneak behind your back, 
Punch him well, he'll give you no 
Chance, and quickly give the trip, 
And until he kisses mother earth, boys, 
Never lose your grip.

MY NATIVE LAND SO GREEN.

t 
AM a 
true born Irishman, I 
came from Paddy's land, 
Where the stranger finds a 
welcome with the grasp of 
friendship's hand, 
Where the wit it flows spontaneously, and pleasure does 
abound, 
And good nature mixed together in abundance can be 
found, 
Where the boys are all so jolly at a 
pattren race or fair, 
For courting pretty girls, none with them can compare, 
They're the bravest set of boys that ever yet were seen, 
The boys of dear ould Ireland, my native land so green. 
You will surely find that Paddy, his aid will always lend, 
And be ready to assist you, if e'er you want a 
friend, 
If his cabin you should enter, you as well as me, 
He'll treat you to the very best, quite welcome you will be, 
He'll share his pipes and whiskey, your spirits he willc heer, 
Oh ould Ireland you're my darling, the spot I 
love so dear, 
For true hospitality, no matter where I've been, 
There's no place like ould Irelend, my native land so green. 
If e'er you're bent on pleasure, abroad you need not roam, 
There's no such sights in foreign lands like those we have 
at home, 
43 
Killarney's lakes are beautiful as everyone must own, 
And iftyou're fond of nonsense, just kiss the Blarney stone. 
We have scenery in Wicklow, there's the Giant's Causeway 
too, 
The bay and sights round Dublin are splendid to the view, 
I 
have travelled many a 
thousand mile, strange countries 
I 
have seen, 
But none to equal Erin's Isle, my native land so green. 
Then here's success to Erin, my own dear native Isle, 
May discontent soon vanish, and plenty on her smile, 
May discord and ill-feeling be banished from thy shore, 
And prosperity shine on thee as it did in days of yore; 
I 
only wish for happiness, that our troubles soon would 
cease, 
So we might live like brothers in unity and peace, 
May trade increase and flourish and shortly will be seen, 
Tka people gay and happy in my native land MO green.

WAIT TILL YOU GET IT. 
WE'RE always a 
wishing, 
It matters not what, 
For seldom you'll find one 
Content with his lot ; 
Perhaps you wish that a 
fortune, 
Might fall in your way, 
Say—ten thousand a 
year, 
Well—all I 
can say. 
Clionns. 
h 
wait till you get it, 
Wait till you get it, 
And if you don't get it, 
Then wait till you do. Repeat chorus 
If you're hard up, on this 
You may safely depend, 
You'll find it a 
job 
To discover a 
friend; 
Just ask one to lend you. 
Well—only a 
pound— 
He'll make some excuse, 
And sure I'll be bound. 
You may wait, &c. 
Perhaps you've been out of Town, 
And just got back by train, 
You feel doosed thirsty, 
And wish for a " drain," 
But it's past twelve o'clock, 
And a 
man dressed in blue, 
Says, " Now then move hon, sir," 
Yon know what to do. 
You must wait; &c. 
My Income Tax paper 
Comes in, when I 
learn, 
That my income is more 
Than three times what I 
earn! 
To lay it on thick, 
They've a 
beeautiful knack, 
Of course I 
return it, 
And write on the back, 
Wait till you, &c. 
Sometimes you go courting, 
The one you adore, 
And you try for a 
kiss 
Just behind the street door; 
She says " Go along, sir, 
You do if you dare! 
If you kiss me I'll scream, 
I 
will I 
declare !"

PADDY THE PIPER, 
Sung by JORN DALY at TONY PASTOR'S Opera House. 
WHEN I 
was a 
boy in my father's mud edifice 
Tender and bare as a 
pig in a 
sty; 
Out to the door shure I 
looked with a 
steady face, 
Who but Pat Murphy, the piper, came by; 
Says Paddy there's few plays the music can you play, 
Says I 
don't know for I 
never did try, 
And he told me had a 
fine charm, 
To make the pipes prettily speak ; 
And he put the bag under his arm, 
And yelled out with a 
beautiful squeak. 
CHORUS. 
With a 
whack fal de dal, do dal da, 
Oh how he handles the grone, 
And such beautiful music he blew, 
It would have melted the heart of a 
stone. 
Full five years I 
followed him, nothing could sunder us, 
Till he one morning had taken a 
sup, 
He slipped from the bridge to the river just under us, 
And went to the bottom just like a 
blind pup, 
I 
roared out, I 
bawled out, I 
heartily called out, 
Oh Paddy, my friend, don't you mean to come up. 
He was dead as a 
nail on the door, 
Poor Paddy was placed on the shelf, 
So I 
took up the pipes on the shore, 
And now I 
set up for myself. 
With a 
whack fal de dal, Scci

A 
BIT OF MY MIND, 
As sung by EDDIE NORWOOD. 
I'AM not of a 
quarrelsome nature at all, 
But a 
peaceable sort of a 
man, 
And I 
always avoid a 
dispute or a 
brawl, 
That's to say if I 
possibly can, 
Still if people behave in an insolent way, 
Or to argue or fight are inclined, 
Why I 
first listen calmly to all they've to gay, 
Then I 
give them a 
bit of my mind. 
CHORUS. 
A 
bit of my mind, a 
bit of my mind, 
If friends or relations should e'er prove unkind, 
You cannot conceive the relief that I 
rind, 
If I'm able to give them a 
bit of my mind. 
When a 
wild little urchin, of seven years old, 
I 
was under a 
pedagogue's rule, 
And the first time I 
got into trouble, I'm told, 
Was for smashing a 
window at school; 
I 
was promised the cane, as a 
matter of course, 
Which I 
told them was not very kind, 
But I 
didn't much care tho' they flogged me by force, 
For I 
gave them a 
bit of my mind. 
A 
bit of icy tninC, ttc. 
I've bean sadly deceived by my intimate friend, 
Though I 
have treated him just like a 
prince, 
For he took all the cash I 
could manage to lend, 
And I've never set eyes on him since; 
Still I 
wrote him a 
letter, indignant and strong, 
Full of all the bad names I 
could find, 
And it plead me to think, tho' his conduct was wrong, 
That I 
gave him a 
bit of my mind. 
A. bit of my mind, & c. 
So if ever I'm injured, or treated amiss, 
My behavior is always the same, 
And I've one satisfaction at least, which is this, 
That I 
don't think I'm greatly to blame. 
If my wife should elope with a 
rival to-day, 
(Though I 
might not at first be resign'd), 
I 
should feel myself better, " I'm happy to say," 
If I 
gave them a 
bit of ray mind. 
A 
bit of my mind, &e.

ALL DE DARKIES GITTING trP. 
Sung with great success by HARRY WOODSON, at Telly Pas-
tor's Theatre, New York City. 
We are a 
band of sinners, 
And we am gone astray, 
We're sailin' on de sea ob sin, 
And we hab lost de way. 
Old satan stole de compass, 
To see if we had pluck, 
We heard de voice of Gabriel 
Say don't you trust to luck. 
OM yes! he did, oh, yes, he did, 
Den all de darkies gittin' up ; 
Oh. yes ! he did, oh, yes! he did, 
Den all de darkies gittin' up, 
For dey hab lost de way. 
The storm is on de mountain, 
De wind is on de shore, 
When I 
hab climbed de golden gato, 
I'll go and sin no more. 
Ole massa he's a 
hypocrite, 
He prays so loud on Sunday. 
And when we're in del corn - field, 
He whips us all on Monday. 
Oh, yes! oh, yes ! etc.

On, good evening white folks, one and all, 
We ask your attention for awhile; 
We'll sing and dance and do the best we can, 
We hope you'll like our old plantation style, 
Down on the Mississippi, where we were bred and 
born. 
Onouus. 
Bnt now we're gwine away 
We ain't got long Vo stay. 
So faye you well white folks, one and all. 
How often we'd go up on the deck, 
'Twas then the moon was shining bright; 
We sang dar our good old nigger songs, 
And den we jump and dance with all our might; 
The white folks used to laugh, and clap their hands 
so loud, 
They'll make us sing and dance again, 
Then didn't we feel proud.

But now we're gwine away, 
We ain't got long to stay;

THE WHISTLING COON. 
Written and Sang by SAM. DEVERI. 
Copyright 1878, by SAM. Dinrium 
Oh ! I've seen in my time some very funny folks, 
But the funniest of all I 
know, 
Is a 
colored individual, as sure as you're alive, 
As black as any black coon. 
You may talk until you're tired but you'll never get a 
word, 
From this very funny queer old coon; 
He's a 
knock-kneed double-jointed hunky-plunky moke, 
And he's happy when he whistles this tune. 
Whistles, etc, 
Oh, he's got a 
pair of lips like a 
pound of liver split, 
And a 
noso like an ingun rubber shoe, 
He's a 
limpy, happy, chuckle-headed huckleberry fig, 
And he whistles like a 
happy killy be. 
He's an independent, free-and-easy, fat- and-greasy ham, 
With a 
cranium like a 
big baboon, 
Oh, I 
never heard him talk to anybody in ray life, 
But he's happy when he whistles this tune. 
Whistles, etc. 
Oh, he'd whistle in the morning, through the day and 
through the night, 
And he'd whistle like the devil going to bed; 
Oh, he'd whistle like a 
locomotive engine in his sleep, 
And he whistled when his wife was dead. 
One day a 
fellow hit him with a 
brick upon the mouth, 
And his jaw swelled up like a 
balloon ; 
Now he goes along shaking like a 
monkey in a 
fit, 
And this is how he whistles that tune. 
Whistles, etc. 
As sung by Goss AND For. 
You may take me to the east, 
You may take me to the west, 
qut I'll hear the bugle sounding in the morning 
On the land or on the sea, 
No matter where I 
be, 
I 
will bear that bugle soundiug in the morning. 
CHORUS. 
You will hear those sinners cry, 
And look up towards the sky, 
When they hear the bugle sounding in the morning, 
Yes, they'll look up towards the sky, 
And watch the black angels fly, 
When they hear the bugle sounding in the morning. 
Just at the nick of time, 
When we reach the dividing line, 
We will hear the bugle sounding in the morning, 
We'll see sinners on that day, 
Flop their wings and fly away, 
When they hear the bugle sounding in the morning. 
Cllonus. 
You will hear those sinners cry, 
And look up towards the sky, 
When they hear the bugle sounding in the morning, 
Yes, they'll look up towards the sky, 
And watch the black angels fly, 
"When they hear the bugle sounding in the morning. 
UNCLE ZEKE'S BOYHOOD HOME. 
Words and Music by FLORA MOORE. 
As sung by M. H. Fot.Ev. 
good morning, one and all I 
have come to make a 
call, 
But perhaps I 
am forward so to speak ; 
For it's nigh onto twenty years since last that I 
was here, 
And the Nvhite folks used to call me Uncle Zeke. 
It was here in Tennessee old mosso set me free, 
When we used to pick the cotton and the cane ; 
And now I 
have come back to my plantation home, 
I 
will never leave the dear old place again. 
CHORUS. 
Fot it's since I 
have returned my heart is filled with pain, 
When I 
think of those happy times so long ago, 
Awl before I 
say good-bye, one step for you I'll try, 
Just to show you that the old man he ain't slow. 
Now everything is changed and the old man he looks strange, 
To the place that was his boyhood's home ; 
But I 
have traveled many a 
mile, just to see my old wife smile, 
And from her side I 
never more will roam. 
Now I 
remember clear the scenes to me so dear, 
When we wandered arm- in- arm down through the lane ; 
And the niggers used to sing like happy birds in spring, 
But I'll never site those dear old times again. 
For it's since, etc.

UNCLE RUFF'. 
As sung with immense success by HA.RBY BLOODGOOD. 
OH! when I 
was a 
little piccaninny. 
I 
used to love old Massa and Missus too; 
They brought me all the way from old Virgina, 
And not much work they ever made me do; 
But now I'm growing old, yes and feeble, 
And my hair is all a 
turning into gray, 
And when the leafs is brown upon the tree, 
This then old Uncle Ruff will pass away. 
CHORUS. 
Muffle up the banjo, put away the bones, 
The jawbone and the fiddle hold aloft, good lamb, 
Place my old white hat on the peg behind the door, 
And say good-bye to poor Uncle Ruff. 
The Lord has given me orders to be ready, 
And I'll be on hand when Gabriel blows his horn, 
I 
thank the Lord for keeping me so steady, 
To meet him up on high when I 
am gone. 
They say that Heaven is a 
mighty kingdom, 
With corn and cotton fields so bright and gay, 
Where there is no oberseer and but one master, 
And from where de darkies neber runs away. 
Muffle up the banjo, etc. 
TURKISH REGULARS. 
As sung by DICK SANDS. 
I 
am a 
dacent Irish woman; 
As you can plainly see; 
My husband he has left me 
And gone across the sea. 
Now if he don't come back to me 
And his fourte,m little dear:;, 
We'll all hire out as soldiers 
In the Turkish Regulars. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, driven, driven, oh. oho! 
Oh, driven, driven, delish agra, 
Oh, driven, driven, oho! 
Why did you go and leave your darling ? 
Some say he's gone to Turkey, 
The army for to join; 
Others to the Black Hills 
Looking for gold mines. 
Now if he don't come back to me 
And his fourteen little dears, 
We'll all hire out as soldiers 
In the Turkish Regulars. 
Oh, driven, etc.

DORKsTADER, for the great BARLOW BROTHERS. 
Copyright by C. R. DORKSTADER. 
W ELL, how de do, good evening, everybody, 
A 
colored gal I 
come around to see, " 
And I 
heard her shouting down the lane dis morning, 
Quit your fooling, stop your laughing, let me be. 
All de coons about de neighborhood am trying 
To take de gal away from me but shoe, 
We belong together down'in Alabama, 
And together twist the heel and shake de shoe, 
CHORUS. 
Down in Alabama, 
( sDal.) 
Pomp, Ike, Zeke and Hannah, 
(sym.) 
How we wish dat we was back in Alabama 
Among de coons to cause 'em all surprise; 
When dark would come we'd 'semble for de frolic. 
And we'd keep it up until de sun would rise. 
Down de Mississippi River in Alabama, 
We was reared among de cotton and de corn, 
And we love to sing about the sunny country, 
Whar we first beheld the rosey light of morn. 
Well you ought to see us shuffle off de Juba, 
While Uncle Ruben patted de time, 
We'd make de coons get up and scratch de gravel, 
We de bosses was in Alabama's clime. 
Down in Alabama, etc. 
All de coons at night would 'semble in de kitchen, 
Jess to sing and dance upon de floor, 
When Pomp and Zeke got up to play de fiddle, 
And Han would dance, dey all began to roar. 
Wid de picananies playing in de corner, 
A-pulling ob de hair and telling lies, 
'Deed and double tell you what 'twas mighty funny. 
And we'd keep it up until de sun would rise. 
As sung by Ye Old Folks Concert Troupe. 
As I 
look around about, 
My head is in a 
whirl, 
I 
see this world so greatly changed 
Since I 
was but a 
girl. 
Old notions, out of date, 
They're all made over new, 
I 
don't know how they do it quite, 
But yet I 
know—they do. 
CHORUS. 
Yes, times are changed about, 
And everything goes—askew ; 
I 
don't know how they do it quite, 
But yet I 
know—they do. 
Once on a 
time young men 
Were steady and upright, 
But now in sporting spend their time, 
And in it much delight; 
They drive about fast teams, 
On the governor's money, too, 
It shocks me quite, I 
don't know how, 
They do it, but—they do. 
Yes, times are changed, etc 
Young ladies now are not 
Like those I 
used to know; 
When I 
was young we waited 
Till sought after by a 
beau. 
But now things are reversed 
And going all—askew: 
I 
don't know how they do it, 
But—they do. 
Yes, times are changed, etc.
