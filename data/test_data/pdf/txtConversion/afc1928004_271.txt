JOHNSON & BRUNO. — Ah ! now we have got the finest of 
all exponents of Acrobatic Song and Dance. 
The masterly 
skill exhibited by these gentlemen, while executing their 
grotesque and extremely laughable and dffficult dancing is 
something marvellous in its way, and should be seen to be 
fully appreciated, as their act cannot be described and do 
justice to it.— Fall Ricer, 31ass. 
VARIETY ENTERTAINMENT. — The excellence of the amuse-
ment at Barton Opera House, last evening, has not been 
equalled since Manager Smith assumed the control. 
The 
new celebrities that appeared obtained the most substan-
tial recognition, and the audience reluctantly accepted their 
retirement, after repeated responses to their numerous en-
cores. 
Messrs. Johnson & Bruno, in their specialties, ig-
nored the old-fashioned way of singing and dancing and 
gave an exhibition of ground and lofty tumbling, to music 
that would astonish the Acrobatic World. — Syracuse, IV. Y.

JOHNSON 8c, BR-CTN.° 
JAMES M . 
JOHNSON was born in Canada, of French pa-
rents, on the 9th of March 1855. 
Shortly after his birth 
his parents removed to Fall River, Mass., where he attend-
ed school eight years, receiving a 
fair education. At the age 
of fourteen he was sent to Providence, R. I. • to learn the 
art of hairdressing ; butt, accordug to the evidence of his 
employer his love for dancing interfered with his work, 
and finally, at the age of fifteen he deserted a 
calling which 
had always been distasteful to him. 
He next turned his attention to Negro Minstrelsy, and 
organized a 
troupe, called " JOhnson's Ironclad Minstrels," 
making his first appearance with his compan-,,, 
at Tiverton's 
Four Courtiers, near Fall River, and meeting with great 
success. 
After playing in various towns he disband' ti his 
company, and proceeded to Philadelphia, Pa., where he 
performed five months at the Eleventh street Varieties, re-
ceiving unbounded applause at every appearance. 
At the conclusion of his engagement be effected a 
p.trt-
nership with Mr Robert Wilson, an excellent performer. 
Their first appearance together was at the Theatre Co-
mique Washington, D. C.. wh, re their success was simply 
marvellous ( so says the New York Clipper.) 
From thence 
they travelled throughout the country, creating a 
perfect 
furore in every town they visited. 
After a 
partnership of two year's duration they separated 
at Fall River by mutual consent, Mr. Wilson going to 
:5 
Philadelphia, and the hero of this sketch remaining with 
his father, who is a 
wealthy and respectable citizen of Fall 
River. 
While there he played an engagement at the Nov-
elty Varieties, where he met Mr. Bruno, with whom he 
formed an alliance, agreeing to join him at the first conve-
nient date. 
Mr. Bruno proceeded to New York, where he was joined 
by Mr. Johnson shortly afterward. 
They made their first 
appearance as song and dance artists at the Columbia Op-
era House, New York City, Feb. 13, 1875. 
They then went 
to Williamsburg, L. I., playing at the Grand Central The-
atre, and to use the manager's phrase, " made tho biggest 
hit ever made in that town." They next appeared at Hart-
ford, Conn., Providence, R I., Fail River, Mass., Syra-
cuse, N. Y., Buffalo N. Y., Cleveland, 0., and finally, at 
the Olympic Theatre, Broadway, New York City, where 
there success was so astonishing as to justify the manager 
of that theatre ( Mr. John P. Poole , in announcing that 
they had made " the biggest hit on record." 
Mn. AUGUST BONNICHSEN (professionally known as Sig-
nor Bruno), was born in Copenhagen, Denmark, Scandi-
navia, on the 4th oi May, 1852. 
He entered the profession 
as a 
contortionist while only seven years of age, travelling 
through Denmark, Norway and Germany, with various 
circus combinations, until fourteen years old. 
The cruel 
treatment he received at the hands of his employers, how_ 
ever, forced him to leave the business, and he then became 
a 
sailor 
The adventures and hardships of the ensuing six years 
of his life, had . we the space to chronicle them, would 
more than fill this little volume. During his first voyage 
(bound f
,ir Greenland), the vessel was frozen in the ice, 
and he was forced to live four months , among the Esqui-' 
maux. 
He has also visited the following countries, and is 
familiar with their languages, namely :—Denmark ( his 
native land), Norway, Sweeden, Greenland, Germany, 
Spain, France, New Zealand, North, South and Central 
America, China, Japan, Italy, the East and West Indies, 
the Sandwich Islands, the Fejee Islands England, Ireland, 
Scotland, and Wales; has been shipwrecked, barely esca-
ping with his life; and has also participated in a 
bull fight 
in Central America. 
Mr Bruno is probably the most accomplished linguist 
and dialect comedian on the stage, to- day and his imita-
tions and rendition of various languages cause peals of 
laughter at every performance. 
He speaks the English 
language without the slightest foreign accent. 
At the conclusion of his travels, which cover a 
period of 
nearly seven years, he settled in California, playing in dif-
ferent theatres under the name of " the limber boy." 
By 
this time he had become thoroughly Americanized. 
He 
then made a 
contract to travel through Central America 
with a 
troupe called " La Campagnia Le California," which 
company dissolved shortly after their arrival in Guatemala. 
Being without money, he applied to Mr. Maths, the 
American Consul at that place, for assistance ; and that 
gentleman, on learning he could speak Spanish, appointed 
him major domo, or overseer, on his sugar plantation, 
where he remained two months. 
At this time he contracted a 
disease very common in 
that country—fever and ague—and was obliged to leave. 
From that period up to the time of his meeting with Mr. 
Johnson, he played in the principal Variety theatres 
throughout the country, meeting with immense success. 
Although not originally a 
Negro Minstrel, he has very few 
superiors to- day in that line of business. 
That Messrs. Johnson & Bruno are now at the head 03 
'tk 
their profession, is evidenced by the tumultuous applaus4 
nightly bestowed upon them.

THE MANIA MONIA NIGS. 
Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1875, by A. J. 
FISFIER, in the office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington. 
Written expressly by Mr. HERRON, for JOHNSON &V, 
BRUNO. 
They say that we are mad—perhaps its so— 
But we never could tell the reason why 
We like to rock upon the heel and toe ; 
And sling these number tens away, so high. 
We were born among the cotton and the cane, 
And the Mania Monia Niggers is our name. 
Our hearts are always glad, and of course we're 
never sad— 
But everybody tells us that we're mad. 
Oh ! you couldn't keep us still if you should try, 
For we are de wildest darkies in de town ; 
We're lively as de lightning in de sky, 
Our daddy says he'll have to nail us down. 
Oh! give us room according to our size, 
We're sure to make you open wide your eyes, 
Our hearts are always glad, and of course we're 
never sad— 
But everybody tells us that we're mad. 
CORPORAL JIM AND I. 
As sung by QUEEN & W EST. 
Just look at us and you may know 
Our likes, before, has ne'er been seen; 
We both belong to Company G, 
And dress as gay as a 
Horse Marine. 
Recruit—Its our delight, both day and night, 
At the tap of the drum to be ready to fight; 
And willing for our country to die— 
Aye, nobly, Corporal Jim and I. 
CHORUS. 
Corporal—Oh, my! ain't we happy? 
Recruit—Just as happy as we can be. 
For we're going in to town. 
The pretty girls to see. 
(Comic drill) 
Both—Then come and be a 
Horse Marine, 
A 
gayer life there ne'er was seen ; 
So get up courage, come and try 
To be like Corporal Jim and I. 
Corporal— To-day we left the camping ground, 
To march to town, the sights to see ;. 
With martial air and look so grand, 
The Ladies' Pets we like to be. 
Recruit—You should see us when to town we go; 
The girls at us sweet flowers do throw; 
They kiss their hands and warmly try 
To win both Corporal Jim and I. 
Chorus. 
Written 6xpressly for JOHNSON S..r, BRUNO, by H. BFNNETr. 
! 
dancing is a 
happy occupation, 
No matter whether dancing reels or jigs; 
But if you want to see a 
big sensation, 
Cast your optics on these Acrobatic Nigs ; 
We learned our dancing down in Alabama, 
Where all de darkies sing and crack their jokes, 
But if you want to burst yourself with laughter, 
Watch de motion of dese Indian Rubber Mokes. 
CHORUS. 
We're sure to make you think you are in Heaven 
For your troubles, boys, you will not care a 
fig ; 
Oh ! watch us while we sling these number 'levens. 
We are double-breasted Acrobatic Nigs. 
Oh ! the boys were always jealous of these darkies, 
Because they couldn't sling themselves around ; 
Oh ! we used to set de Piccaninnies crazy, 
Two others, like us, never could be found ; 
And often our old Massa used to wonder, 
And many times we've seen him shake his fist; 
For it used to make him just as mad as thunder, 
To watch us while we done our double-twist. 
We're sure to make you, &c. 
LIMBER NIGS. 
As sung by JOHNSON & BRUNO. 
Oh ! kind folks watch our motion, 
And give us a 
little chance ; 
We'll raise a 
great commotion 
With our latest song and dance ; 
We've seen a 
heap of trouble, 
Lut we do not care a 
fig 
For sorrow, for we're known as 
The Happy Limber Nigs. 
CHORUS. 
Oh ! white folks watch de motion of our feet. [Break 
To please you all we are bound to do it neat. [ Break_ 
If we can only please you, 
When we make a 
little noise ; 
It will give us satisfaction 
When we try to please the boys. 
At sundown, when our work was done, 
How gay us .Nigs would be ; 
Its then we used ter babe our fun 
Wid de gals, so gay and free ; 
And since we left that good old home, 
We love to dance our jigs ; 
And happier boys cannot be found 
Than us, lively, Limber Nigs. 
Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1875, by A. J 
ris'azis, in the Office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington 
We lived down South at de breakin' of de war, 
As happy as Niggers could be; 
But the white men came and tuck us from our homes, 
And they told us that we were free ; 
We ' listed, den, with the Federal troops, 
And we went for to fight de foe; 
And when de boys had sorrow in their hearts. 
Why dis am de way we'd go, 
CHORD'S. 
'Things am changed on de old Plantation, now, 
We hung up de shovel and de hoe; 
But we often think of those happy days, 
And de way dat we used to go. 
When work was done, we'd gather in de barn, 
For to rattle de heel and toe; 
And dance dat good old Mississippi fling, 
To de tune of de old banjo. 
We'll never see dem good old times again, 
For death has laid our Massa low; 
But de tears run down our cheeks like de rain, 
When we think of the way we used to go. 
Things am changed,

Original by JOECNSON & BRUNO. 
When dead men yawn at midnight. we come forth, 
And sing of merry days that we have seen; 
And lightly as the rustling of the wind, 
We dance and sing and tumble on the green; 
We revel in the moonlight's yellow gleam, 
Until the chanticleer does loudly crow; 
By mortal eyes we never can be seen, 
For under the cold ground we quickly go. 
CHORUS. 
Rattle our bones, [ Break 
Over the stones ; [ Break 
Oh! pity us poor skeletons, forlorn; 
When the cocks crow, [ Break 
Under we go, [ Break 
We sing and dance until the break of dawn. 
We do not fear the thunder's awful roar, 
Nor lightning, as it rushes through the sky! 
We'll never see our comrades any more, 
Until the day does come for them to die ; 
But when death lays his hanl upon their beads, 
We'll welcome them, and quickly show them how 
We pass away the time among the dead! 
What would they think if they could see us now? 
Rattle our bones, /ze.

We are two colored Congressmen, 
'Who never steal a 
cent— [ Barn 
And for the public good, of course, 
Our efforts all are meant— [ Bain 
We never take back pay, you know, 
It is beneath our gaze! 
We only take our salary— 
It's funny how it pays ! 
CHORUS. 
We are two colored Congressmen, 
And honesty we teach; 
We're never known to take a 
cent— 
When it's out of our reach! 
To serve the public interests, 
It is our only aim; 
And if the Treasury is robbed, 
Why we are not to blame. 
Oh ! when we were elected, 
It was by the people's voice ; 
They knew that we were honest, 
And we were their willing Choice 
And soon we will be Ministers, 
To England or to France ; 
And with the beauties of the Court, 
Oh! we will have a 
dance ! 
We are two colored, L.2.

It's now a 
hundred years ago, 
Since freedom first did dawn ; 
And many a 
thought comes o'er us, 
As we hail the coming morn; 
So we'll make bold, the Scenes unfold, 
The changes from that day; 
The battles won, the great things done, 
Since Freedom gained the day. 
We'll tell you, first, of Bunker Hill, 
There Warren met the foe 
Who wished to tax the people 
That the Tea did overthrow. 
He nobly tried, and bravely died, 
He well the battle won. 
And Washington, the finish gave 
To what he'd left undone. • 
One hundred years since the days of Seventy-Six! 
One hundred years since we did the tyrants fix ! 
Then praise with joyful glee the banner of the free, 
And the men of Seventy-Six! [ Repeat] 
Then Jackson! with his cotton bales, 
He made the red-coats fly ; 
Our banner, still triumphant, 
The invaders did defy ; 
And Lawrence fought, the lesson taught, 
Not to give up the Ship ! 
And Winfield Scott, at Lundy's Lane ! 
In the days of Seventy- Six! 
As sung by JoimszsoN & BRUNO. 
My song is of a 
nice young girl, 
Whose beauty, style and grace, 
I 
know her name, but I 
won't tell; 
Oh ! such a 
pretty little face, 
Oh clear! I 
sigh as she passes down 
By the shady side of the lane ; 
And the eyes in my head goes rolling around, 
Whenever she passes by. 
CI:fonts. 
For she's just as pretty as a 
little butterfly, 
That flies around in the grasses; 
For she's sweeter to me than pump ,z; 
pie, 
Sugar, bread and lasses. 
This little beauty I 
do declare, 
Is sweeter than a 
bowl of cream; 
And the folks all say when she passes by, 
That she is the prettiest ever seen. 
Some day or other she'll be mine, 
I 
can see it in her eye ; 
And if that day don't ever come, 
I 
will lay me down and elk. 
For she's just as pretty, &c.

LITTLE ROSEBUD, are you lonely, 
Now I

For of you I'm thinking only, 
As I

Earth has no delights for me, 
And I

O'er the land, and o'er the sea. 
_Attie Rosebud, I

Home to see you once again ; 
For I'm weary now of roaming, 
Drifting o'er the stormy main ;

To the sunshine of your smile ! 
Then will sadness be a 
stranger, 
And life's F-7weeteist joys beguile.

MASSA'S KITOBEN FLOOR, 
As sung by JOHNSON &.", BRUNO. 
Two old Virginia Niggers, 
You musn't think we're green; 
When working on the Steamboat 
On the Mississippi stream, 
We used to tote the cotton bales, 
And heave the plank ashore; 
And often spend our money 
On the Old Virginia shore. 
CHORUS. 
Two lightning, colored Mokes, [ Break 
From Old Virginia shore. [ Break 
[Repeat 
And now we'll show you how we dance 
On old Massa's kitchen floor. 
When on the old platation, 
Us clarkies held our sway ; 
We'd sing and dance from morn to night, 
And on the Banjo play; 
We'd pick the cotton, hoe the corn, 
And when our work was o'er; 
Then all together we would dance 
On Massa's kitchen floor.

STYLE OF THE DAY. 
As sung by JENN.ZE LDTDSEY. 
I'm a 
jolly young leader of fashion, 
A 
belle that's so festive and free ; 
Of course you will say I 
am clashing. 
For nothing but style suits me ; 
With young swells I 
often go driving. 
They call me so chaiming and gay, 
That I 
try to outdress all the others, 
And bring out the style of the day. 
CHORES. 
Then I 
laugh and I 
wink at the fellows, 
Who oft on their knees to me pray; 
But I 
think I 
will have to stay single, 
To bring out the style of the clay. 
I 
have many rivals who try to 
Outshine my gay style so fine; 
But then I 
always can beat them, 
For my Pa he owns a 
pld mine 
If I 
owe a 
V, X. or a 
50, 
And havn't got it to pay, 
l 
just send my bill to my parient. 
And he pays for the style of the day. 
Then I 
laugh, and I 
wink, &c. 
As Sung by JOHNSON (.4:. BRUNO.

Believe the two professors of 
The terpsichorean art.

SOLID GAY YOUNG MEN, 
As sung by JOHNSON & BILDNO. 
We're what you call two solid, gay young men, 
If you doubt us we will prove it, for we can; 
For tossing and dance at night 
Gives us joy and great delight— 
In this country, our likes you ne'er can find. 
CHORUS. 
For we turn right around, 
Plant our feet upon the ground; 
And all the pretty girls are bound to bow you know, 
As down the street we go, 
From each tongue you'll hear it flow, 
There goes them two, solid gay young men. 
Oh! we were at a 
ball the other night, 
And all the darkies they begin to fight; 
But then we never run, for we're always in for fan, 
And to sing and dance you find is our delight. 
For we turn right around, &c. 
As sung by JOHNSON S: 
BRUNO. 
Have you seen the curious beast, 
They call the Rinorosos, 
With horns upon their noses like 
That Elephant's probosos. 
Oh, yes, my dear! I'm told they come 
From Africa's morasses ; 
And that they revel in the mud— 
Eats various kinds of grasses. 
Oh yes ! We've seen the curious beast, 
The Rinorossorosos; 
With horns upon their noses, like 
'That Elephant's probosoS. 
In their heads they have a 
sparkling eye, 
Like those of the young lasses ; 
And curling o'er their backs a 
tail 
Has the Rinosoros. 
Oh yes, my dear! we'll get a 
team 
Of beautiful Jackasses, 
And then we'll go right down the street 
And see the Rinorossoros.

Making music in its tranquil flow ;

And one was rent and left to die, 
And the other floAted forward all alone,

And it's little I

And I'll pledge all belonging above,

From the heart of the country I 
love.

leave on your shore, 
Though your mountains and streams I 
will see in

As sung by CHNIILE S KON01.I.NAti. 
-rTHINK I've travelled everywhere, and seen wlatt's to be seen: 
Wherever I 
may roam, I 
make my self at home: 
I've flirted down to Long Branch, to Newport I 
have been, 
To Saratoga, Rockaway and to Rome; 
I've seen society in every shape and form, 
I've watched the tide of fashions rise and fall; 
I've viewed it in its calm, I've seen it in its storm, 
And this is my conclusion after all. 
CHORUS. 
Baden-Baden Spa, France and Germany, 
Liverpool or London, Spain or Italy: 
In such society there is much variety, 
But nothing equals New Yuri: society. 
Society as soon as the New York season's o'er, 
Will to the sea run down, where in a 
bathing gown 
dabbles in the water, ot 'wrTs upon the shore, 
It yawns and wishes it was back in town: 
,And though it may be nice to drink the nasty waters, 
And lose your money gambling at the Spa, 
-And meet the sort of men you'd cut at any place, 
The New York season I 
prefer by far. 
Baden-Baden Spa, tic. 
Society I've met with in old Ireland, mid the bogs, 
In Paris ever gay, in London every day, 
In Mt. St. Bernard convent, with the monks and jolly dogs, 
At every place I 
think that) may say; 
But there's a 
charm in town, I 
can't help saying so, 
Which makes me like it more than all the rest: 
To the opera we go, and that will plainly show 
Society in New York is the best.

licGEE was a 
jolly old cobbler, 
He came from the divil knows where; 
Of whiskey he was a 
great gobbler, 
And delighted to go on a " tare." 
He was often persuaded to alter 
His habits and live like a 
man ; 
But whenever he tried he would falter, 
And go back to his bottle and can.

McGee was a 
terrible man, 
He was always so flighty and frisky; 
He tried to reform, but he couldn't keep warm, 
Sure, he'd die if he had'ut his whiskey. 
His wife was a 
dacent old woman, 
And scolded from mornin' till night; 
She told him he must be inhuman 
To be keeping them in such a 
plight. 
He would listen in scorn and derision, 
And drink just as much as before ; 
Till at length she gave out her decision 
To begin on a 
temperance war. 
McGee was, etc, 
She went to a 
temperance preacher 
And stated the case of McGee; 
He promised to help the poor creature—

A 
song with a 
glass in his hand; 
'Twas the glass he was fond of adoring, 
And he seemed hardly able to stand!

Dear Misther McGee," said his rev'rence 
"I hope you will alter your ways;

Front the evil that's blightin g your days!" 
'Pon me soul, sas McGee, ' I

But I 
fear I 
can never be steady 
While a 
drop of good whiskey is near." 
McGee was. etc. 
" 
Fear not," said the man of cold water, 
" 
You'll show us how good you can be; 
The demon of drink we vill slaughter, 
And we'll honor the name of McGee." 
Then he promised to keep at a 
distance. 
All drinks of whatever degree; 
"Noble man, you shall have our assistance— 
In a 
iveek the result we will see. 
McGee was, & c. 
SPOKEN.— The reverend gentleman, after some farther per-
suasions, took his departure, and Mr. McGee at once became a 
strict disciple of temperance. 
The sudden change of life had a 
severe eflect upon him; he lost all his exuberant spirits, being 
entirely under the control of his wife and the temperance advo-
cates, who filled his mind every day with solemn lectures, and 
worked him into such a 
queer state— half comfort, half despair 
--that he would often say to himself, " Begob, I'm not meself 
41 
at all!" 
At last they induced him to state in a 
public meeting 
the various benefits he had derived from his adherence to the 
pledge—the comfort, the happiness, the great joy and peace of 
mind he had experienced during his short season of sobriety. 
He attended the meeting, and with a 
very grave countenance, 
related his experience as follows: 
RECITATION. 
Good people, I 
stand here before you to-night, 
Me mouth very dhry, arid me head very light; 
It's three weeks to-day since I 
joined the r,:ns 
Of the Wather Brigade, I 
left od me ould pranks 
And ever since then, sure, me life has been ieessed 
With a 
great many comforts, and nights of good rest. 
I 
paid all me debts, and I 
bought a 
new gown 
For the wife of me bosom—a 
beautit'Ll brown— 
I 
took from the pawn shop me foine. Sunday coat, 
Which cost me last winter a 
ten dollar note, 
And put a 
new sole on the ould woman's shoes,— 
A 
moighty big job, for she wears " twinty-two's!" 
I 
made a 
new sty for the tine little pigs, 
And fixed up the garden with bushes and twigs; 
I 
wint to a 
lawyer and made out my will, 
My duty to all I 
was bound to fulfill. 
And yesterday morning, ( don't think that I'm scofiln), 
I 
bought for me body an illigant coffin! 
Fori know if my whisky is taken from me, 
You'll very soon make a 
dead man of McGee.

Sing of love, of love only sing. 
CHORUS. 
Sing! Sing! Ah! Ah 
Ah Songs'xr pity me, 
Why ca.n I 
never 
Sing a 
song of rapture like thee? 
Oh sing, sing on, e'en to deceive me, 
Bird with visions glit'tring and vain; 
Rain flatt'ring hopes, oh do not leave me, 
Sing of love, of love only sing. 
Soon from my dreams shall I 
waken to sorrow, 
To day give me rapture, I'll weep to-morrow; 
Oh sing, sing on, e'en to deceive me, 
Sing of love, of love only sing. 
Sing! Sing!

HAYER, the gre,itest Clown of the Northwest. 
The Hero of my humble song 
Was once a 
mighty man. 
A 
shining light in his mighborhood, 
And chief of au his clan ; 
But when he found in course of time 
The tricks his friends did play, 
Sure he left them all, and now they cry, 
Mulcahy's gone away! 
CHORUS. 
He was great and grand, and took command 
Of the boys on Patrick's day ; 
But now the cry is everywhere, 
Mulcahy's gone away ! 
He won onr pride and won our praise, 
And he deserved it too! 
Sure many a 
time tor nights and days 
We stuck to him like glue ; 
He held an office of the State, 
And faith he made it pay ; 
But for such a 
place he was too great, 
And nor he's gone away! 
He was great. k, 
The politicians worshipped him, 
And swore he'd yet be Mayor; 
And tho' the chance looked rather dim, 
He thought it bright and fair; 
But ere he came to rule the town, 
His mind was led astray, 
And now the cry is everywhere, 
Mulcahy's gone away! 
He was great, Jrif 
He was as sound a 
Democrat 
As ever filled a 
chair, 
But he lost his great position, 
And it drove him to despair ; 
'We know not where to seek for him; 
He must have crossed the say ; 
0, it grieves us just to think of it— 
Mulcahy's gone away! 
He was great, ette. 
He treated us like gintlemen 
Whenever we did meet ; 
The sight of him would do you good, 
From his head down to h's feet ; 
He wore a 
collar stiff and high, 
Which made a 
great display; 
He was a 
most distinguished man-. 
But now he's gone away I 
He was great, &c, 
The girls went crazy when he winked, 
And many an artful plan 
They put in operation for 
To catch this darlin' man ; 
But now they're left alone, poor things; 
They weep and wail, and say— 
Oh, what'll we do at all? 
Mulcahy's gone away! 
He was great, ctc.

MESELF and Barney Casey wint to have a 
little spree, 
He had a 
bottle for himself and another one for me, 
We thravell'd round the city till our heads and feet were sore, 
And ev'ry dhrink it was so nice, it made us wish for more. 
CHORUS. 
Bad luck to Casey's whiskey, it made us both so frisky 
We dhrank our bottles empty, and at last we couldn't stand; 
Along the street we rambled, we staggered and we scrambled, 
And sang a 
song, the whole night long, of gay ould Paddy's 
land. 
We:met a 
big policeman, and he looked at us, says he, 
" 
What brings you out so late as this?" says I, " the country's 
free;" 
" 
Shut up," says Casey, " come along!" " 0, divil a 
bit," 
says I, 
"I'll sthrike him if he says a 
word, the durty mane ould 
spy!" 
SPOKE. — And if I 
ever did sthrike him he might well say— 
Bad luck to Casey's whiskey, ..tc. 
He turned around and left us— sure the man was not to blame, 
I 
called him back and axed him, if he'd plase to tell his name; 
" 
Of coorse," says he, " Its Flannigan, I'm from the County 
Clare." 
"Hurroo !" says I, " shake hands me b'y, our whiskey you 
must share." 
Chorus.— Bad luck to Casey's whiskey, .kc. 
Out kern the empty bottle, and I 
put it in his paw, 
'Look out,'' says he, " whin on me post, a 
dhrink's agin the 
law." 
He put the bottle to his mouth. but divil a 
dhrop was there, 
And while we laughed at Flannigan, sure he began to swear. 
Chorus.—Bad luck to Casey's whiskey, A

Tie raised his chili above his head, and vow'd he'd take us in, 
For drinking on the hi!2,-Ilway, " 0 " says Casey, " that's too, 
thin ?" 
He drag,g1-,d 
pcor Casey oil to jail, and tried to take me too, 
But to keep a 
honk on Casey was as much as he could do.

But it was all his own doings. 
The two hotth-s fixed him.

And don't begin for to doubt me; 
I 
own my own house, and a 
bit o' land, 
There's no common stock about nie. 
I

boy. 
And left with heaps of lore; 
And came out here to this free land, 
Just pravious to the war. 
Roger O'Malley, that's my name, 
Quite famous I 
have grown; 
I'm far superior to Muldoon, 
Mulcahey or Malone. 
I'm quite independent in my way, 
High-ton'd and well educated; 
All my taxes I'm ready for to pay, 
And I'm not in the least dissipated.

cigar, 
With comfort and delight; 
But you'll never see me login' round 
The whiskey bars at night. 
Roger O'Malley, Scc. 
I'm as dacent a 
man as you can find. 
Like all my seven generations; 
With a 
good deal of Limning in my mind, 
Which I 
use on important occasions; 
I'm far above yer common scraps, 
That fling their names all round, 
And they'll not catch me in any traps, 
For I'm sensible and sound. 
Roger O'Malley, 36e.,. 
I'm a marshal whenever we parade, 
I 
ride a 
horse from Araby; 
With a 
big stick of honor in my hand, 
Sure, in martial aflairs I'm no baby. 
I 
ate my fill, an(' wear good clothes, 
Made up in the style you see; 
My walk is grand, and plainly shows 
That there's no such man as me.

But. by and by, away be will fly.

With sympathetic voices near 
To whisper these words in her ear:

See when the moonlight falls on the streamlet, 
Silvering each ripple with its brilliant rays; 
Out in the midnight, making the heart. bright, 
Waking up the little birds before the break ot day.

am growing old and weary now, my sight is getting dim. 
And my work on the earth is nearly done; 
Old massa has departed, I

And my friends have cross'd the river one by one. 
Oh, ' tis sad to bid good-by to all that was so dear,

And my good old wife she wander'd by my side ; 
Our little home was humble, but happiness was there—

Now 'tie sinkin:,, to decay, and all is dark and sad, 
And I

Ah, yes, I

The angels soon will call me, I 
soon will be at rest, 
In that bright and happy home so far away. 
Still I 
linger by the door and try to sing my song 
As I 
used to do among the sugar cane; 
And I'm waiting for the summons, and it soon will come 
along 
To my little old log cabin in the lane!

YE may talk about your " Mulligan Guards," and " Regular 
Army, Oh !" 
I

started for to go. 
And be a 
bold milishee boy, so happy, gay and free, 
In the gallant " Sixty- Ninth," I 
jined the ranks of Company 
G
;If 
They put me in the " Awkward Squad," wid about a 
dozen 
more. 
Will a

We marelfd unto the right and left, until me feet were sore, 
When we were in the timid " Awkward Squad."

" 
Lift! Lift !" the sargint used to say, 
"Now ye's have it! can't ye keep it ? 
Turn yer head this way! 
Right about! Shoulder arms !" 
An hour every day, 
Whin we were in the timid " Awkward Squad." 
I 
found it very difilkilt to keep the step at all, 
Along wid all the others when paradin' in the Hall; 
At aieh mistake I 
used to make, the sargint he would say: 
"Yer as awkward as the divil: doan't ye honk' yer gon that 
way!"

Whine'er he'd spake an ordher, but egad! Isms wid a

I 
often wished, upon my soul, to put a 
head on him. 
But he at least weigli'd twenty stone, while I 
was very slim, 
From marching in the timid " Awkward Squad." 
Chorus.—" Lift! Lift !" Abe. 
Whin we're considered compitant, into the company 
They'll put us in the ranks at wanst, and there they'll let us be; 
And undher sargint's orders thin no longer well plod, 
Shoukiher arms and counther marchin' in the timid " Awkward 
Squad." 
Whin out into the strate we go to have a 
foine parade, 
We'll be looked upon wid pride, me boys, by every servant 
maid; 
And wid the sargint on our rhrlit no more we'll be afraid, 
Of marching in the timid " Awkward Squad." 
Chorus.—" Lift! Lift!" kc. 
If ever I'm promoted, and a 
Gineral I 
be, 
I'll make 'em feel me vingeanee, all sar,gints under me! 
I'll have 'em marchin' ivery day, or carryin' the hod, 
For being so uncivil to the timid " Awkward Squad." 
And if they should retalyate or give me any talk, 
rejuice them to the ranks at wance, and there I'll make 'em 
walk! 
If that ain't punishment enough, ' like any other gawk," 
Gad, I'll put them in the timid " Awkward Squad."

Where the pretty little water-lilies grow.

With what I

I 
only be what I

As deep as deep can be ; 
But sure enough I 
find to my coat,

I

That she could ride in me.

And she might go to bathe, 
If she should drown I'd stick to ht.!. 
My loved one's life to save. 
By her hair, or the soles of her fee 
I'd ,drag my prize in shore ; 
I'd live, and love, and die in peace. 
And never go to sea any more. 
I 
wish that she was Tichborne. 
And I 
was the rightful heir, 
I 
wouldn't go to law to know who's who, 
My money she should share ; 
I'd wed her with three wedding rings, 
To make her safe and sure ; 
And dress her in the finest things, 
That a 
fellow could procure. 
I 
wish I 
was a 
little belt, 
That clasps her tiny waist, 
Or else the jewel in her hair— 
Which, by-the-by, is paste. 
I 
wish I 
was a 
little puppy dog, 
Put in a 
show for sale, 
And if she would only purchase me, 
Forever I'd wag my tail. 
I 
wish I 
was a 
tom cat, 
And she was a 
tiny mouse, 
And we should be the occupants, 
Of a 
four-roomed empty house; 
If she should run from her hole, 
And try to escape from me, 
If she'd refuse to be my wife 
Then gobbled up she'd be. 
I 
wish I 
was the Shah. 
With his twenty thousand wives, 
Oh wouldn't I 
then go Harum scar= 
And frighten them out of their lives; 
Or I 
wish I 
was England's Prince, 
To marry the Russian Maria, 
I'd sail about the sea in ships, 
And set the Thames on fire.

THE DAUGHTER OF CHARLOTTE TEMPLE. 
No one who has read the touching account of the 
misfortunes of Charlotte Temple, with that a..bsorb-
ing interest which is inseparable from INT1'S. Row-
son's writings, can rest satisfied while denying them-
selves a 
perusal cf the life of Charlotte Temple's 
Daughter, Lucy .femplc. 
It is a 
sequel possessed of all the thrilling in-
terest that characterizes the life of the unfortunate 
mother, while it exemplifies in a 
wonderful manner 
" 
the visitation of the sins of the parents upon the 
children." 
It depicts sorrows that refuse the balm of sym-
pathy, and consolations which those arcund us 
" 
can neither give nor take away." 
It contrasts in 
living colors the richest fruits of virtue and happi-
ness on the one hand, and the bitter end, blighting 
disappointments and rair resulting from once yield-
ing to the seductive influence of passion. 
It points a 
moral that commends it to the atten-
tion of all, and is pervaded by an interest that will 
hold the reader in ;:apt attention to the end.

It gives information of the modus oper-

THE APPRENTICE, 
OR 
First Book for Mechanics, Machinists& Engineers 
By OLIVER BYRNE. 
12mo., cloth. $ 1.50. 
ENDORSEMENTS OF THE PRESS. 
The highest praise which can be given to this excellent 
elementary work on practical mechanics, consists in the fol-
lowing simple statement of facts: The editor of this journal, 
while teaching natural philot,ophy and chemistry in the 
Cooper Institute from 1859 to 1864, was in need of a 
text-
book of practical mechanics, adapted to the advanced classes 
who had been trained in mathematics; in his search among 
the many mechanical text- books, there was not one which so 
fully answered his requirements as the above work. 
It was 
therefore adopted and used with perfect satisfaction, and it 
is with pleasure that he receives it now as an old friend from 
the publishers, gives it his most earnest recommendation, 
and wishes it in the hands of all who are still in the fog about 
the units of work, calculation of the power of machinery, 
resistance to motion, strain on material, etc.—.1Etnufacturer 
and Builder, July, 1874. 
4,Whe author of this work is well known as an extensive 
wiiter who has made some valuable additions to American 
technical literature, enumerated above in detail. 
The work 
we are now noticing is a 
theoretical treatise on practical me-
chanics, designed to supply a 
recognized deficiency. 
Most 
of the works on mechanics treat the subject in a 
manner 
which is not available to young men commencing as appren-
tices in shops. 
Any young man with a 
fair knowledge of 
arithmetic may, however, use this work to great advantage ; 
it is not only suitable for a 
text-book, but also as a 
work 
of reference. 
Most ambitious young men will make them-
selves so familiar with its contents as to be able to refer 
readily to any portion of the book. 
The author has adopted 
a 
new notation to distinguish units of work from other units, 
which is not without value, and might be advantageously 
introduced into more ambitious works. 
The book is well 
printed on good white paper, and bound in stiff cloth covers.
