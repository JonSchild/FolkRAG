I have no particular questions at the moment

I plan to come alone, leaving my almost grown-up Camily to

 It should be a salutary

Dear Mrs. Hawes:
 
I em pleased to inform you that you have been awarded a grant
 
to participate in our Summer Institute in Anthropology for College
 
Teachers.  You have until April 1 to inform us in writing of your
 
acceptance of this award.
 If I do not hear from you by April 1
, I
 
will assume that you do not wish to participate.
 
Before you send us your decision there i
s some information
 
which I think you should know.
 
1
.  You will be expected to live in dormitory housing especially
 
provided for Institute participants and their families.  Assuming
 
your acceptance, you will receive further information on housing
 
and payment from the office here on campus in charge of these
 
arrangements.  Experience with this kind of housing arrangement
 
makes it necessary that participants with children six years of age
 
and younger live outside the dormitories.
 If this applies to you,
 
please indicate in your letter of acceptance and we will put you in
 
contact with the family housing office here on campus.
 If it does
 
apply, this will perhaps cause some modest inconvenience for you,
 
for even if you live off campus, we request that you eat the noon
 
meal in the dormitory with the other participants and further we
 
will expect you to participate in the other scheduled events In-
volving Institute participants.  The noon meal will be an additional
 
expense of approximately $55 for the ten weeks.
 
2
.  You will wish to know who your instructors will be and how the
 
program is arranged.  This information follows:

that this section may have to be scheduled in the afternoon
 
for this two weeks.)

As you can see, you will be attending three classes a day regu-
larly throughout the summer with the exceptions of the field trip and
 
the last week.  Normally, classes will meet four days per week--
Monday through Thursday with Fridays to be used for examinations.
 
In addition to class attendance, provisions are being made for regular
 
meetings in small groups for discussion purposes.
 
You will want to know about examinations.  Each instructor will
 
give you one examination on his material at the close of his stay.
 
Specifically the examination schedule is as follows:
 
June 30
 Introduction to Cultural Anthropology
 
Introduction to Physical Anthropology
 
July lI
 
-
 Anthropology and Genetics
 
Introduction to Archaeology
 
Nature of Culture, first examination
 
Aug. 4
 -
 Primate and Human Evolution
 
Ethnological Theory
 
Aug. 18  -
 Race
 
Linguistics
 
Nature of Culture
 
These examinations will be required of all participants taking the
 
Institute for credit and optional for those registering for no credit.
 
The type of examination can be expected to vary with each instructor.
 
3
.  No later than June 23 travel checks will be available, figured on
 
the rate of 4 cents a mile, to a maximum of $100.  On July 7 the first
 
stipend will be paid
..
 It will cover the first three week period of the
 
Institute, or a total of $225 per participant.
 In addition, you will
 
'

 cm t
19 rer week rer derendent.

The second payment of the grant will be on July 28 for the three week
 
period prior to that date.  The remainder of the grant, for the final
 
four weeks of study, will be made no later than August 2
1
1.  Your dormi-
tory room and board payments will be sdjiisted so that you will owe
 
one-third of your total on each of the payment days.  You should know
 
in advance that in some cases the amount due may exceed the amount
 
you are paid, depending on the number of dependents you bring with you.
 
L
i
.  We are planning a field trip for midway through the Institute
 
which will be required for all participants.  Possible stopovers include
 
Bandelier National Monument, Chaco Canyon National Monument, the Santa
 
Fe Museum, Aztec National Monument,  Mesa Verde National Park, and the
 
pueblos of Taos, San Ildefonso, and Cochiti.
 In a brief five day trip
 
i
t i
s hoped that participants will obtain an illuminating cross-section
 
of the archaeology and the ethnology of our northern Southwest.  Un-
fortunately, we cannot include the families of participants in this
 
field trip.  We will be able to provide those of you who need them
 
with sleeping bags but we urge you to bring whatever sleeping equip-
ment you may have.  We will work out further details of the field trip
 
after your arrival.
 
5
.  A number of informal gatherings have been planned.
 We expect to
 
have a weekly evening coffee session and an outdoor steak fry.
 
6
.  We will contact the Institute lecturers for bibliographies and
 
will send these references to you as soon as possible.
 
7
.  You will have to make application to the Su mer Session; a form
 
is enclosed.  Fill it out and mail directly to the Director of Ad-
missions, University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado, 80302.
 You
 
should plan to register on the afternoon of the first day of classes,
 
June 19.  The Institute participants will be registered as a group
 
and you should ignore the regular alphabetical registration schedule.
 
Facilities in the dormitory will be ready for occupancy on June 18.
 
Tuition charges are waived for all participants.
 
8
.  You should know also that I will not be here during the summer.
 
I am going to be on a Faculty Fellowship to the Dept. of Genetics
 
at the University of Hawaii.  Responsibility for the Institute will
 
rest with Dr. John Greenway, Professor of Anthropo1o r, and Associate
 
Director of the Sumner Institute.
 
As I look back on this letter it appears that I am being
 
cautious and perhaps discouraging.
 I am sure that you can understand
 
that the main reason for this is to avoid misunderstanding after you
 
arrive.
 If you have any questions, by all means drop me a line.  Let
 
me repeat finally that we are anxious to know your decision as soon
 
as possible, and we must know by April 1
.
 
S
incerely yours,
 
Jack Kelso, Director
 
Suxmner Institute i

Dear Sirs:
 
I am startled at your communication dated October
 
31, 1966 concerning my application for graduate status in
 
which you state you have not received my transcripts from
 
Bryn Mawr College.  Not only did the Bryn Mawr registrar notify
 
me a month ago that the transcripts had been sent, but my
 
check paying for them has already cleared through my bank
 
account.
 
I have written Bryn Mawr asking them to send another
 
set an  I would deeply appreciate your expediting matters as
 
rapidly as possible at your end, since I still have hopes of
 
being able to register for the winter quarter.
 
Sincerely,

I have carefully reviewed your application materials and have obtained
 
the advice of the departmental faculty with whom you wished to be
 
associated.  We are unable to accommodate you in the curriculum which
 
you have recuested due to the large number of highly qualified applicants
 
for the places available.  For this reason, I regret to inform you that
 
I am unable to approve your application for admission for graduate study.
 
In the event that a space should become available, your name has been
 
placed on a waiting list.  You will be notified by the department if a
 
vacancy occurs so that you can let us know if you are still interested
 
in study here at that time.  In the meanwhile, we prefer that you know
 
of our present crowded situation so that you may make your plans ac-
cordingly.  I wish you every success in your further academic studies.
 
Sincerely yours,

We'd like to include as many theories and ideas about play and
 
games as possible.
 Would you be interested in coming for one
 
session to talk informally about your interests?  The majors
 
of students already enrolled range from bio-electronics to
 
folklore, so I look forward to some interesting discussions.
 
The course meets Tuesdays, 4-7 pm, beginning April 7
.
 
I hope you have one Tuesday free to drop by.
 
Sincerely,

similar applications.
 I promise not to talk unless and until
 
you want me to sound off from my own perspective.
 I shall,
 
in any event, turn up at the first meeting and see how over-
crowded you are.

a behalf of the Department and the Graduate Division we welcome you.
 
Materials relevant to your registration are enclosed.  These include a
 
iegistration Circular; a notice of intention to register with information concerning
 
an appointment for your physical examination; the statement of California residence
 
status; a Vaccination certificate; an application for housing and information about
 
parking permits; and a supplementary information sheet provided by the Graduate
 
Division which we hope you will find helpful.  The University has tried intelligently
 
to use automated methods for the registration of its students and preservation of
 
their records.  This is an effort to spare you, as an individual, the inconvenience
 
of more complicated procedures.
 
On the basis of the information we have available, you have been tentatively
 
classified as a
 resident
 of the State of California.  Your final
 
classification will be made on the basis of the statement of residence which you
 
will submit with your notice of intention to register.

If you filed an application for financial support, a separate letter will be
 
sent to you by the Student Support Section of the Graduate Division or your major

delight in flying, horses in running, so the quick stirring of the mind is most
 
proper unto man.
 If we can be of service to you, do not hesitate to call upon us.

Dear Dr. l
ce3sos
 
I understand f
rom Dr. Greenwiy that the Anthropology Department
 
at the Univer s
ity of Colorado has been c
onc
i
 d
ari n
g s
etting up another Institute
 
somewhat along the l
ines of last s
uiumer' a Institute for Teachers of Anthropology
 
(
which I was fortunate enough to attend).  As Dr. Greenway axp].ained it, this
 
one would run for a f
ull academic
 year and would be open to 3
Ux
t er Institute
 
students who wereinterested in continuing towards the i
,A * degree,  He suggested
 
that the matter might be s
ettled, one way or tho other, during e
arly December
 
and t
hat we s
hould write you for information.
 
Is there a
zr possibility you will be off
 uring a program such
 
as I have described for the academic year 1967'8, or possibly l968.9?
 
If s
o  I
 would appreciate your s
ending me any available information or putting
 
me on your l
ist for future notification.  I an interested in wor ing for an
 
1
4.A o in anthropology, and naturally greatly appreciated t
he MA funding that
 
I received last s
um m
er.
 
I also found that I
 reacted well t
o the intensive kind of program
 
in c
omparison to occasional course—taking; it was £n t
o have enough t
ime to
 
dive into a subject rather than s
andwiching it in between a
 thousand o
ther
 
problems.  I understand, by the way, that t
he i
nstitute students owe D
r.
 
Lawrence $
r der's participation directly t
o you; we are surely in your debt.
 
I
 had prepared '
o
tyseif to suffer through genetics in silence, but he is such
 
a magnificent teacher that it was impo
ssible 4a not to become enthusiastic.

At the end of last s

N
DA funds to underwrite another such institute for the acade n

1968.9, the goal of which would be the master's d
egree in  nthropology._,
 
He thought that the project night be firmed up around t
he f
irst of
 
D
ecember, and s
uggested that we write you around that time and inquire
 
as to the possibilities.
