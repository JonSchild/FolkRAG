Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
EC: I wonder if we could start, if you could each just say a little bit about when 
you were born, where you were born, and your family? I guess you’re starting, Ms. Smith. 
[Laughs] 
JS: I was born in Jones County, Free State of Jones. I was born January the 1st, 
1940, and basically I have property up there now, I have the family property, so my heritage 
is deep there. And, eventually I would like to move back to Soso. There’s so many fond 
memories. I had wonderful parents. They really raised us right, under the circumstances, 
being a product of the Free State of Jones. Parents didn’t teach us to hate anyone, and that 
was a good thing for me, especially going through the movement. I stayed in Jackson for a 
while, for two years, then I moved back to Soso, finished high school, and met my husband. 
I married him and moved here to Hattiesburg is 1959, January. 
EC: You know, not everybody is going to know about the Free State of Jones. 
Can you tell us about that? 
JS: Okay. Captain Newton Knight was able to meet my great-great-grandmother, 
Rachel. His grandfather had bought her as a slave. He fell in love with her, and he figured 
that he would just establish his own state. He didn’t believe in segregation. He married her 
and he had a family by her. And, my grandfather was a product of that family. So, he wasn’t 
successful in establishing his Free State of Jones, so he deserted the Confederacy and joined 
the Union. 
RB: And he seceded from the Confederacy. 
2 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
JS: Right. He seceded. And, there is a movie coming out about it. It’s—Dr. 
Bynum was doing like you; she wrote a book on the Free State of Jones. And what that book 
does, it documents my people. 
EC: So, in Mississippi, where we think of things as sort of black and white, right? 
RB: It was never black and white. 
JS: Never. 
EC: And I think this area is one of the places that really shows some of the 
complexity of that. 
RB: Yes. 
JS: Right. It did. And then, that’s one reason—because a mixture of the races-- 
that’s why black people have so much land; because they gave all their children that. 
EC : And that’s the land that’s still in your family? 
JS: That’s the land that I have. But it comes from my mother’s side, which is the 
same—my father’s side, which is the same type of situation. My grandfather was Indian and 
white, and you know, there’s just a mixture like that on both sides, biracial people. 
EC: What kind of work did your family do? Your parents? 
JS: My mother was a black nurse, and my father was a contractor, a carpenter. 
And he did farming; he had his own land. He was hired out, he built a lot of—some of the 
elegant homes there for the doctors and lawyers and people like that. He was independent. 
EC: I want to come back and follow up, but Ms. Branch, could you tell us about 
when and where you were born, and your family? 
3 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
RB: I was born the 1st of September, 1941. We’re of the same age group. I was 
born here in Hattiesburg, 711 Whitney Street in my grandmother’s house. It was a three- 
room shotgun [5:00] house, with outdoor privy. We had sidewalks, so—at that time you paid 
for them, if you wanted to get sidewalks in front of— 
JS : You paid for them? 
EC: Did you pay the city or did you pay somebody to put them in? 
RB: You paid the city. You paid the city and they installed it. So, the street on 
which I was born had a church on the corner, Miss Emma Campbell, who—I don’t know 
where Miss Emma came from—but Miss Emma was even lighter in skin color than Jeannette, 
and Mr. Kelly I think was some way tied up in that. There are several little communities 
around Hattiesburg where there were situations like Jeannette’s parents, and they had 
children. 
I was born here in Hattiesburg. I had one brother born here in Hattiesburg, even 
though they’re ten of us, ten children. And I too, come from family out around Prentice, 
Mississippi, a little village called Mount Carmel, Mississippi. And we went back and looked 
at the books, and my great-grandparents actually bought their property, forty acres. Each 
one—they bought eighty acres. Nobody gave that forty acres and a mule. That never, never 
was a true thing. It might have been on the books, but it wasn’t something that actually 
happened. But land was divided up in forty acres. 
I lived between Hattiesburg and Mount Carmel. Went to school between Hattiesburg 
and Mount Carmel. And I’m a person who, I would say, I would beg to differ with you about 
4 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
the civil rights history. There really—we are making history today, because civil rights is still 
a problem, worldwide. 
EC: Yes, ma’am. 
RB: And I don’t believe in different races of mankind. We’re all men. We’re all 
mankind. We’re not all men but we’re all mankind. I would love to have it before I die, 
where people are like Jeannette and I. We were never taught to hate people, because when 
you went to a funeral, there were blonde and blue-eyed people there who were your closest 
of kin. So, you grew up with this in your head. And I really never knew a difference until 
the death of Emmett Till, and that—I was in Chicago at that time. I was a teenager. And up 
until then, just did not realize the hatred and hate. 
I knew there were differing communities, but the lady who lived next to my great¬ 
grandmother, who was married to a gentleman who did not have much sense, I would say. 
He drank and he didn’t take care of his family properly. He didn’t farm properly. And she 
was what we call today white, Caucasian, of European extraction, poor white folks, some 
folks called them. Poor crackers, some people called them. But, she would come over and 
help my great-grandmother get food in and can, and peas shelled. So, my great-grandmother 
would give food and meat to her to take to feed the host of young’uns, as they say, that she 
had. Her husband was no good, but she would come and help my great-grandmother. So I 
grew up not really understanding because there were situations like that. 
EC: Was that kind of interaction in community, was that the same in town as it 
was out in the country? 
5 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
RB: I think in town, women of color worked in the big houses, in the houses, and it 
was—many times it was a reciprocal relationship. You were able to carry home the food that 
was left over, the clothes that were too little left over. When you wanted to buy a house, 
Miss Anne [10:00] could call the bank, or her husband could call the bank, and say, “Give 
so-and-so that loan for that house.” So, there were—there were relationships, but the badness 
was there. It was there. I think the movie, The Help, tells the story better than anything I’ve 
ever seen, as far as the meanness. 
EC: What kind of work did your parents do? 
RB: My father was a farmer. He died when I was fourteen and he died in Chicago. 
He thought—he couldn’t get a job. There were no jobs. You couldn’t be hired out by 
someone. We—I can remember picking cotton, sitting on what they called a slide, pulled by a 
mule, from one field to another. And my mother was a housewife up until we went to 
Chicago. 
In Chicago, my father worked—the first job he had was Tip Top Bakery, and I’m sure 
it was just scut work. My mother’s first job, I remember, was at Brach Candy Company, and 
my mother was so fair, they hired her thinking she was white. And she didn’t have better 
sense than to go sit and have lunch with the person, the one woman in the building, who was 
colored. She would go and sit and have lunch, and finally the supervisor said to her one day, 
“Why do you go sit with her and have lunch?” And, that n-word. And my mother said, 
“Because I’m one of those.” And she was fired on the spot. And I would have kept the job if 
it helped feed my children, because we lived much better in Mississippi than we ever did in 
Chicago. 
6 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
EC: Was that because you could raise your food, or what was the—? 
RB: You had land, you could raise your food. You had relatives. You had family, 
and everybody in town was kin one way or the other. 
EC: I was going to ask what it was like for you to move to Chicago from 
Mississippi. 
RB: It wasn’t that much different, as a child. There were very few children of 
European extraction in my classes. Very few. There were none here, except for all of those 
little high yellow ones like Miss Smith, or even their blonde, green-eyed cousins, but it 
wasn’t much different. When we went to Oak Park outside of Chicago, or Winnetka, Illinois 
on the train—the school would take you on the school trip. You’d go on the L train and just 
ride so far and get off and come back. And you would see all these big, beautiful homes and 
communities. But you didn’t internalize it as something against you, you just figured that 
your parents couldn’t afford it. But we did own our home in Chicago. My daddy bought a 
home—in fact, he bought two. And he got sick. He had some type of blood dyscrasia, and 
my mother was pregnant, and we lost our home and we ended up in the barn, homeless. 
Furniture in the alley. 
EC : What’d your family do? 
RB: We lived in the park for a while. We were just homeless folks trying to find 
someplace to sleep at night, and that was usually one room and everybody piled into that one 
room. I would never take my children back to a city. Now, this is a city, but I’m now able to 
own and buy and sell, but I would not. People—I see people in, let’s say, out of Africa and 
out of the Middle East, trying to get to Europe. [15:00] Some are getting there and finding 
7 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
out the streets are not paved with gold, and it’s better at home. Even if you had to mash the 
corn by hand, it’s better at home. 
EC: I want to come back to what you said about Emmett Till, but first I was 
wondering if you could both tell me some of the things that you learned in school and from 
your families that you think are important. 
JS: Well, I grew up in a family of self-Seventh-Day Adventists. We had our own 
school. We were called the “white Negro,” so you know, even though our relatives were 
dark, you had to fight racism within both races, and you had the terrorists; the Ku Klux Klan. 
It’s just that, we were descendants of Newt Knight, so didn’t nobody bother Newt, because 
he was known. He didn’t take no stuff. You didn’t bother his people. But, when my mother 
married my daddy, they called him Musgrove, them crazy Musgroves. He said, “My 
children are going to public school. We’re not going to isolate them. They’ve got to live in 
the real world. They’ve got to live with their relatives. Some of them are dark, some of them 
are light. We didn’t have anything to do with this, so what we’re going to do, we’re going to 
live within what’s going on, you’re going to accept what’s going on. You’re not going to 
have any hatred against people that’s darker than you, and white people. You’re going to 
live in the real world. You’re going to love everybody. 
My people were Christian people. They didn’t believe in hatred and stuff like that, 
and if you—you know, open-minded and—. Our people had traveled, and I had never traveled 
that much—but I did—but I had relatives who had been everywhere and were very important 
people. And, you had struggles with terrorists that had been going on from the beginning of 
time. That’s why—. 
8 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
RB: We’re used to terrorism. 
JS: Fm just so appalled that they’re making such an issue on these immigrants. It 
just, to me as a little girl, I always wondered, how can they come in here and take this 
country from the Indians, slaughter them and kill them, and it’s their country? Then I found 
out in California they did the same thing. It’s just people that conquered. And then, my 
mother would teach me to read the Bible. It was going on back then, same thing; brother 
against brother. There’s sin in the world. That has nothing to do—. They don’t even know 
why they’re doing it. 
So, then as a little girl, I have so many questions. Why would this man, knowing it 
was illegal, marry this—well, she was a mixed woman—marry her and try to establish his own 
country, and bring about children that are going to be faced with all this hatred among both 
races? You’re not accepted anywhere. 
So I remember going up the street—you see now, but I had them all the time, but I 
tinted. I tinted my hair just as soon as I could, and I learned because my mother—or, my first 
cousin had a beauty college right by Jackson State, so I learned how to cover it up. I thought 
to myself, I said, “A little pole cat. Fm just strict—. Fm just messed up.” And then my 
mother would get on my case, “Why you asking all these questions?” I said, “Well Mama, I 
just want to know.” She said, “We don’t talk about that. We’re trying to outlive that. I don't 
want you to go back in the past.” You know? “You didn’t have anything to do with being 
born. You’re God’s child.” So I kept pounding on that; Fm God’s child. I don’t feel I have 
any feelings toward anyone, I get along with everyone. Those are just problems of the world. 
You’ve got terrorists all over the world, fighting over a little piece of land over there in Israel 
9 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
that’s not enough for anyone. Same thing all over the world. So, I know that—which my 
mother taught me—and as I get older I know this: I’m Jesus Christ’s child, or whatever 
religion you believe in. My salvation is not of this world. [20:00] It’s somewhere else. 
EC: You know those questions you were asking and your sense of not belonging in 
either community? Do you remember sort of when and how you first had a sense of not 
belonging in either community? Or, how that happened to you? How you understood that? 
JS: Well first of all, they questioned my eyes, you know? You can tell a person is 
biracial; they mostly got the green eyes. You know, they got those eyes. And, they called 
me—I was a devil’s child. You know, I’d just been—. 
EC: Was that at school? 
JS: Well, up in Soso I lived exactly a mile from the school and I couldn’t catch the 
bus because I didn’t want to fight my relatives. I’d walk to school every morning. It was 
something about your hair. They’d pull your hair. They did—. “You’re different.” You 
know? And then I just wanted to be like everybody else. 
RB: We’re still being called different in Hattiesburg. [Laughs] 
JS: You’re right about that. So what I’m saying is, can I be just American? I 
want to be an American citizen. I don’t want to be black or white. Ain’t I an American? 
You know? 
RB: Same thing here. 
JS: Then you think about it within yourself, and then you’ve got to be very 
careful. You don’t want to offend anybody. You can’t be too outspoken because you’re 
10 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
offend someone, and I really don’t want to do that, but it’s very difficult when you’re mixed. 
Very. Even when you’re born, you know you’re different. 
RB: They called my mother “butter gal” because she was blonde and her—at the 
time, her stepfather was her stepfather [.v/c]. My grandmother was raped by the plantation 
owner, and when she found out she was pregnant, she ran off from—it’s a little area out near 
Prentice called Friendship. And, she ran off to Hattiesburg. She worked enough to buy a 
house. They were selling houses from World War I off of Camp Shelby. Little shotgun 
houses they had down there. And they moved them from Camp Shelby up to Hattiesburg so 
there would be just lines of these shotgun—. 
JS: Rows. 
RB: Rows of shotgun houses, they’d stick them beside the railroad track, 
anywhere. She married—my grandmother married what they call a Cajun out of southern 
Louisiana. 
EC: At that time, what did they—what made someone a Cajun? 
RB: They were Frenchmen out of—originally out of Newfoundland, and you know, 
they loaded them down—shipped them down from Newfoundland to the Louisiana territory. 
And the Native Americans—and I don’t know which nation—the Native Americans and 
Africans. And, they are still calling themselves Cajuns. They speak with a little accent. 
They live in those swamps. I’m not saying they’re backwards or anything, it’s just that they 
maintain that culture. And my mother’s father—whom she called Father—she fit him. So, my 
grandmother made a decision never to have another child after he was killed on the railroad. 
He worked on the railroad in 1932. And that was a year when—I did a little research—when 
11 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
there were many men of color who were killed on the railroad. Now, whether it was just 
purely accident or intentional, I don’t know. 
But, my mother was an only child, and my grandmother would put a bowl on top of 
her head and just cut her hair around like that and around the front, and she would deliver the 
butter that my grandmother would make, because my grandad had a cow and a pig that he’d 
keep down on the river, which was just a quarter mile away. So, for my mother, she would 
not talk about the fact of who she was and how she came about. It was a taboo subject. And 
I went looking for [25:00] a birth certificate for her, and the sad thing—I can’t smile on this 
one—the sad thing is that she lived until she was sixty-seven and she never knew her real 
name. On the birth certificate it says Christine Halloway. They mixed my grandmother’s 
name—which was [Fannie May?] Holloway—they took the O—mistook the O and made it an 
A or just didn’t care or whatever. So, she was born and died and never knew her name, but 
her name that we knew was Alfonsia Elsie, after her daddy out of Louisiana. And when we 
looked up Frank Elsie, she was the only child listed under him, even though he had been 
married before. And I don’t know if there was a divorce or anything like that. It was very 
hard for my mother. She was like your family. She was ostracized on both sides. If you had 
one drop—one thirty-second? 
JS: One sixteenth. 
RB: One sixteenth of what they called black blood, you were black. So, you could 
be blonde and you could be blue-eyed, but if there was—as Mr. Carter would say, “One in the 
woodpile”—then you were that. For me, I was dark enough—. The only people who mistakes 
me are the—some people from Thailand, or some of the Hawaiian Islands, Fijians, Koreans. 
12 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
There are some dark-skinned Koreans, and I get mistaken, especially by the men, if Fm 
walking on the street. And I lived—. I went to school part time in New York City and I 
found that those kinds of people would talk to me in their language, and I would say, “Fm 
sorry. I don’t understand what you’re saying.” It was probably good I didn’t understand. 
But I know that many people—. And I straightened my hair at that time. I don’t straighten 
my hair anymore. I just got to where I said, “I have to love me no matter what.” And I love 
me all over. I still own the property that my grandmother inherited. So, my daddy’s dead 
and it came to us children, and we’ve maintained it. In fact, I have a daughter who’s retiring 
next year and I gave twelve acres to her and she’s going to build a house on her twelve acres. 
JS: Well ain’t that something. 
RB : And she’s going back to the country like you. 
JS: I love it. 
EC: Does anybody farm your land or is it timber? 
RB: No, it’s timber. It’s timber. But, it’s beautiful land, and Fm sure if you put 
some—. My great-grandmother used to have her garden closest to the house, and then there 
were fields of corn and cotton and all kinds of vegetables. A smoke house. And once a year 
people would get together—once or twice a year—the women would get together and do all 
the canning, and the men would get together in the fall and make syrup and smoke meat and 
the women would make sausage. So, it was more community than what you have in a city. 
You didn’t have that—well, yes you did. You had those, my uncle and aunt who had a store, 
but his daddy—. 
JS: Ancestors. 
13 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
RB: His daddy was colonel—I mean, Colonel Hall. Colonel Robert Hall and my 
uncle Rohan were first cousins. So, him being green-eyed and very fair and blonde, they—he 
not only had the store in our little village, he was even allowed to sell guns and ammunition, 
which was a law. Blacks could not own hardwares so they could—because they could get 
guns and ammunition, [30:00] but he was allowed because he was who he was. 
EC: That’s interesting. 
RB: That family, Aunt Ella May married one of my uncles on my daddy’s side, 
and Aunt Elemay was blonde and blue-eyed when she died, and she was in her late sixties. 
So, we’re just humans, and you can’t afford to hate anyone, because then you hate 
yourself. And I usually don’t use, you know, “black” and “white.” Everyone here at the 
university knows I don’t. And I think some people do things out of guilt, because I know 
that plaza—. Have you seen that plaza? 
EC: Hm-mm. 
RB: There’s a plaza on campus. It has Armstrong-Branch Plaza. It’s two blocks 
long. It’s wide. It has seats on both sides. International Building is on it, because I had 
made a comment that I would love to have the International Building on the plaza. It was put 
on the plaza. So, I don’t think they could do anything else for us. For twenty—. What, 
[19]93 they started, the Armstrong-Branch Lecture Series. So, you’ve gotten watches and all 
kinds of pictures and things, and dinners, but I would rather them use the money for 
scholarships and not things. Because you can blow down a building, and we’ve had some 
buildings blown down on this campus. I mean, nobody—. I don’t think a tornado had ever 
14 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
been through her before it was built, but the school was built over a hundred years ago. But a 
tornado came through and really—. 
EC: Recently? 
RB: Yes. 
EC: I remember, yes. 
RB: Yes, it was recent. It was 2013; February 10th, 2013. 
EC: I actually remember. I was in New York but I remember, because it’s home. 
RB: Now, this is home for you? 
EC: Claiborne County. 
JS: Really? 
RB: Okay, so you’re a Mississippian. That’s right. You did tell that to me. 
EC: I was raised here. Came when I was eight. 
RB: Okay. 
EC: We haven’t talked yet about the fact that you were one of the first students to 
integrate the University of Southern Mississippi, so I wanted to give that context for what 
you were talking about with the Branch Plaza and the lecture series. We can—. 
RB: Without people like her husband and her and the things they did during the 
late [19]50s, early [19]60s, people like Mr. Vernon Dahmer, the Bournes. There are just so 
many people who helped me, helped us. Elaine Armstrong. Gwendolyn Elaine Armstrong. 
That’s her name. Gwendolyn is six years younger than me. She graduated from the same 
high school I did, Rowan, which was the colored high school. She wanted to go to school at 
home. She wanted to stay at home because her mother was handicapped and she felt it was 
15 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
best for her to not go off to Alcorn or Jackson State. And since Ole Miss had integrated— 
quote-unquote; integration never really came about—they had to be the first school—. The 
politics behind it, they had to be the first one, and poor James Meredith really caught hell 
doing that. And people died and people were injured, and the devil showed its face on that 
campus. 
By the time we came here in [19]65, we didn’t have any problems at all. I think I got 
called a nigger one time, and the ballfield at that time was where the business school is, out 
on the highway there, off the service road. That’s where we went and had gym. I’ll never 
forget the first time I went into the gym building to change clothes. I was putting on my 
shorts [35:00] and there was a big mirror. When I came up I could see these girls standing 
behind me in the mirror. They were watching for my tail. Because, some people actually 
thought we had tails, and I guess they had been reared up with that lie. And, I just smiled. 
You don’t pick a fight over something so silly. They could see I had no tail. Maybe they 
thought I cut it off. I don’t know. But, they alphabetized us in class, so I was always one of 
the last ones. If you look in the yearbook, you’ll see. I’m on almost the last page there; there 
were a few people maybe who had come out of Europe or had Zs or Vs or—you know. I was 
a Y. So, there might have been some Zs after me. But in the classroom, I was usually the 
last student. Most instructors just ignored us. We were just there. Elaine and I never really 
had a class together. She was an A, Armstrong. So she was usually up front in the class and 
I was in the back. And, if you look at the yearbook, you can see; they made us all the same 
color. I mean, you can’t find us by color. 
EC: You can’t. 
16 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
RB: No, not at all. The gentleman who was our advisor was Dr. Geoffrey Fish. 
He was in the science department. And Dr. Fish, in a meeting with Dr. McCain who was the 
president, and he had been told, if he allowed anyone to come here, they would shut down 
the school. The governor, who was Ross Barnett at that time, said they would close down the 
school. 
EC: I should say that we’re actually in the McCain Library here. 
RB: Yes, we are actually —. 
EC: And this is the—this is President McCain you’re speaking about. 
RB: This is President McCain. He lived in what we called the Ogletree House. 
The Ogletrees gave a lot of money. I mean, that’s the only way you get something, of 
course, with your name on it, out here. Except my case. The department of transportation, 
King, who was Senator King, at the time, signed off on over a million dollars to put in this 
plaza. I say, I think they did it out of guilt, but it doesn’t matter; it establishes the fact that 
we were here, and there are bronze plaques in the ground on both the ends. 
But, Dr. McCain had stated that he could not let anyone come, and that’s why he 
didn’t let Clyde Kennard come. And what happened to Clyde was criminal, and everyone 
involved should have gone to jail. But at that time, you could just walk up to someone and 
shoot them. You weren’t going to jail. You weren’t even going to—. I mean, if they had a 
trial it was a mockery. 
EC: I know you said you don’t like to use “black” and “white,” but what you’re 
talking about here, right, is if a white person killed a black person? 
17 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
RB: Yes. There’s a video of the guy and they showed it right in that video, it was 
one of those Eyes on the Prize, where this guy walks up in McComb, Mississippi, white, and 
just shot point blank, a black guy who was going in to register to vote. 
EC: That was, I think, State Representative E.W. Hurst, killed Herbert Lee. 
RB: Yes, and they weren’t—I don’t think anything—. I don’t even think they had a 
trial. 
EC : They had a coroner’s jury, that day. 
RB: Yes, but no real criminal indictment and taken to court. 
EC: No. That’s true. That’s right. 
RB: But he was told that USM—. It wasn’t USM, but Mississippi Southern 
College and then went to University, and what they—. Clyde was a person who believed in 
the goodness of mankind. 
JS: He sure did. 
EC: Do you know the story from when it was happening, or do you know the —. 
RB: Oh yes, I know his story. 
EC: So you knew him? 
RB: I knew him personally. I worked where [40:00] he brought eggs. Not every 
day, he would bring in flats of eggs, crates of eggs. I worked in a little restaurant on Mobile 
Street. And the day he came in—. There were several gentlemen. They would meet at Smith 
Drug Store. The leaders. And, they tried to talk him out of coming out here. Each time—that 
last time he came, he came alone. 
EC: Is that the black leadership? 
18 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
RB: Yes. They tried to talk him out of it. Now, there were conversations behind 
the scenes with Dr. McCain, Mr. N.R. Berger, who was the black principal, if I have to 
identify people black or white, who was the black principal over at Rowan. He and Mr. Roy, 
who was a principal at Eureka [School], wasn’t he? 
JS: Right. 
RB: They wanted a black junior college put here in Hattiesburg. So, in a way, they 
were sellouts, to me. And of course, they’re family. I graduated with one of Mr. Berger’s 
sons. And I know they loved their dad, they loved their mom, but to me they were sellouts. 
We needed access. This was a state run school with state taxes. We needed to be able to go 
here just like everyone else. 
EC: And so they tried to talk Mr. Kennard out of coming. 
RB: From coming, out here alone. 
EC: So that they could make the junior college? 
RB: Oh yes, oh yes. They talked to Clyde several times. I think it’s documented 
in the Sovereignty Commission. It’s certainly documented in some of the other papers. So, 
Dr. McCain played the politics, allowed Ole Miss to be the first one, with James Meredith, 
and since we were girls—girls—Dr. Lucas calls us angels, but Dr. McCain had a few other 
choice words, I’m sure, because he belonged to the John Birch Society. 
JS: Right. 
RB: And, that’s just the same as the Klan. So, when we came to campus, I give all 
credit to Clyde. I mean, that was in the late [19]50s. We came mid-[19]60s. And the good 
people who would supply food to me and helped us and paid tuition and stuff like that. 
19 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
Elaine and I both come from poverty, and there were many days we’d walk back and forth 
from the other side of town to here. 
EC: I want to follow up on some of what you said, but Miss Smith, you nodded 
your head, too. Did you know Mr. Kennard? 
JS: I sure did. I knew him in a different way. I knew of him when he was 
arrested and he was in the jail and he was sick. At that time they had Dr. Willis Walker, a 
white doctor, and the Moin (?) brothers, who were very instrumental in the NAACP, and sent 
in her, and the other young lady —. 
RB: To school. 
JS: To Southern. And the two young ladies —. 
RB: William Carey [University], 
JS: William Carey, and my son, integrated to public schools. I knew him because 
Mr. Bourne then wanted him to see one of our—a physician, which was my husband. He 
checked him, and examined him, and explained to them that he needed a work-up. 
EC: This was when he was at Parchman? 
JS: This was when he was in the Forrest County Jail. 
EC: In Forrest County Jail? 
JS: That’s when I first met him, Forrest County Jail. They later, I think, they still 
sent him on to Parchman. They later, when they did check him out, it was too late; he had 
cancer. 
EC: So you think he already had it when he was here? 
20 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
JS: He had it then. He had the symptoms, but he knew that he had to work him 
up. They could have sent him to the medical center up at Jackson, but —. 
RB: They gave him hard labor. 
JS: They did. They just did him so wrong. But, we tried to keep up with him, but 
you know what? That was his mission. That was his mission. God had to free his people 
and the way I see it, [45:00] those things that happened to me, putting me where the moment 
was happening, when I first met Raylawni, I met Raylawni at an NAACP meeting in 1959. 
So, she was the little secretary. So we had to go up those stairs down on Mobile Street. And 
a lot of people say, “Oh, she didn’t live here. She wasn’t here.” But that’s not true. I’ve 
always known her being a fighter. Being a fighter that’ll stand up by herself. She don’t need 
a crowd. You know, so God has put some of us on this Earth as a mission. We have to thank 
Clyde Kennard for his vision. 
EC: Not everybody is going to know about Mr. Kennard, so can you explain the 
backstory, like what happened with him? 
RB: There’s some I can tell you and some I can’t. 
JS: I can tell you something. 
RB: [Laughs] He lived outside—on the north side of Hattiesburg in a small 
community called Macedonia? Or is that Kelly Settlement? 
JS: Kelly Settlement. 
RB: Kelly Settlement, okay. 
JS: By the airport. Out there by the airport. 
RB: Yes, between here and the airport. 
21 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
EC: So you were going to tell us about Mr. Kennard. 
RB: Mr. Kennard had come to Hattiesburg to help his mother. His father died, and 
they had a chicken farm. They raised biddies, small, baby chickens, up to a certain size, and 
then they went off to the feed stores and, depending on the size when they got bought and by 
whom. And he had come out here a total of three times, but when he started and the 
conversations were going on between McCain, the governor —. It might have been Johnson 
all the way back then when they started, Governor Johnson. 
EC: Was it Governor Coleman? 
RB: I don’t think it was Coleman. 
EC: In the [19]50s? 
JS : It was just before Ross Barnett, though. 
EC: I think it might have been Governor Coleman, then Ross Barnett, then 
Johnson. 
RB: Okay. Well, whichever one it was, there were conversations going on, and l'¬ 
as I said—I knew Clyde because he brought eggs into what we called Fat’s Kitchen. It was 
one of the restaurants right next to Smith Drug Store. Yes, it was Smith in the beginning, 
Smith Drug Store. And, over the years—. I graduated in [19]59. That was the year. And, I 
think his—. Was that the last year he came out here? Whatever the last year it was that he 
came out here. 
JS: Fifty-nine. 
RB: And he came alone, and they arrested him. Eventually it was—. At one time it 
was whiskey in the car, at one time it was something else, and then it was, he stole chicken 
22 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
feed. Now, the story about the chicken feed. A friend of his worked at one of the feed stores 
and the chicken feed came in hundred pound bags. So, sometimes the bags on the bottom 
would get damp, and they wouldn’t sell that. They would throw it out, so he would sweep it 
up and they would rebag it. 
EC: Mr. Kennard’s friend? 
RB: Friend. Mr. Kennard didn’t work there; Mr. Kennard worked on his farm and 
sold eggs and chickens I guess, sometimes. The young man—. The man at the time, he 
wasn’t—. He’s my age. We were the same age. Robert [Johnny Lee Roberts], Robert, 
Robert, Robert. 
JS: I can’t recall his last name. 
RB: I’ll think of it. 
EC: We can put it in. 
RB: Anyway, he would get five—. By the time he would gather together five 
hundred pounds, five bags, he would take it to Clyde, because all the chicken feed places, all 
the feed houses, refused to sell chicken feed to him. They figured that would run him out of 
business. 
EC : That’s because he was trying to go to Southern. 
RB: Because he was trying to go to Southern. So they were doing—you know, 
pressuring him. And then he was arrested and it was just—. It was very devastating for me 
[50:00] to see what was supposed to be the law, do such a terrible thing. And, Mr. J.C. 
Fairley and I tried —. We didn’t try, we did. Mr. Fairley got in touch with Dick Gregory and 
Charles Evers, who was in Chicago. Charles Evers was Medgar’s brother, Medgar Evers’s 
23 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
brother, who was killed in Jackson, Mississippi. They met us at the airport in Jackson on a 
private plane that was paid for by Dick Gregory. And we talked Mr. Roberts—was his last 
name Roberts? Anyway, we talked him into going and telling the truth, because if you look 
at the court case, it’s a comedy. “Mr. Roberts, did you say that Clyde told you to steal that 
chicken feed?” “Yessir. Yessir, he did.” He was nineteen, he was very frightened, scared to 
death of white folks, and just said whatever that lawyer said to say, he said. And he got 
seven years. Now, there’s some things I had to leave out of that. But, he is still living. He 
goes to Shady Grove Baptist Church. And, Jerry Mitchell, out of Jackson with the Clarion 
Ledger, and I got together—and he’ll tell you if you email him—and brought the man to my 
house, and he told us that story. So, there was never any stealing involved. They still say 
Clyde Kennard went to jail for stealing. He didn’t. He went to jail because he tried to come 
to Southern. 
EC: You mentioned Mr. Fairley? 
RB: Mr. J.C. Fairley. 
EC: Yes. And he was president of the NAACP then? Is that what—? 
JS: Yes, at that time. 
RB: At that time, yes. Mr. Dahmer was before Mr. Fairley. 
EC: Miss Smith, did you have parts you wanted to add about Mr. Kennard? How 
you knew him and—? 
JS: Well, I think, I guess. We just—. I knew him because the NAACP was 
helping him. 
RB: Oh yes. 
24 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
JS: And that’s who was with the backbone of everything, integrating of public 
accommodations, voting and everything. The reason that you had the summer of [19]64, 
because Hattiesburg was like a mecca of people that—. You had a group of men in the 1950s 
had filed a suit to get the right to register to vote. In the [19]50s, you had a group that had 
always fought for their rights, and we’ve had a branch—NAACP branch here since 1946. So, 
the people came because it was safe. That’s why you had so many people to come down. 
And sometimes it’s said—. I’ll never forget this little judge from Pennsylvania had said, “If 
it’s not local, it’s not real.” See, we were not writers. We didn’t come down here 
representing churches, organizations. We weren’t documenting any history. We were just 
doing it because we wanted our rights. In fact, I have a kind of feeling about that. You 
know, for people to come in to profit from what the people did. A lot of times they don’t 
even get recognition for it, and it’s kind of a sad thing because the local people haven’t 
gotten recognition. They could have lost their lives. They burned churches, homes, ran them 
out of town. Like, they threatened us. They were terrorists, you know? They threatened 
many people. And they lived through that. They didn’t, after two weeks or three weeks, 
they didn’t go back home. 
And then, I’m a traveler, so this friend of mine who’s a journalist who stayed with 
me, I went to visit her in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The first thing I want to know, what 
kind of community. She lived in a gated community, [55:00] no integrated churches, no 
integrated schools. But she was down here fighting our cause and she needed to be home 
fighting her cause. You know, so it just bothered me the double standards. So it stuck with 
me; if it’s not local, it’s not real. If I see act of, you know, segregation right now or double 
25 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
standards, I want to attack it. I want to get rid of it, because it shouldn’t be. We are in 
America. 
You know, and I don’t have any problems being black. I appreciate the black culture. 
They made me what I am, you know? They made me strong, not bitter. I want to get rid of 
the problem. I want to be like everybody else. I taught my children that. Everybody around 
me, I want them to be that. The black people accepted me because Fm, unlike her, I have 
four cultures in me; Indian, I have white, black, Spanish. You know, and Fm one-fourth of 
each one of those. So I was up there in—gambling in the casinos, and somebody told me that 
I could get me—they had some money up there for me, and all I had to do—. 
RB: At the Choctaw. 
JS: Yes. I could get some because I—. 
RB: Five percent. If you’re five percent. 
JS: But Fm one-fourth. 
RB: Oh gosh, yes. 
JS: Sol said, oh my goodness. 
RB: But you have to go up there to apply. 
JS: That’s what they told me. 
RB: Yes, the chief says. 
JS: I talked to the chief before they got the lady chief, and then I thought about 
that. I said, “You know, Fm not trying to profit off of that. I just want everybody to be 
treated equal.” We have equal rights. We are the only race that came here against our 
wishes as slaves. I don’t want—. I don’t want to be bitter about that. Those people were 
26 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
trying to make money, and their folks who had them on the ship, they cleaned them up and 
they started integration on the ship. How could you have such double standards? How could 
you hate people and you have sex with them and families by them? How could you do that? 
How could you own them behind the scenes, and when you get with someone else, you can’t 
own them? But living through that, and when we got us a—. And I’m so proud—. He called 
himself a black president, because of black people. 
RB: When did he do that? 
JS: He’s the black president. Obama? He’s a black president. He aligned 
himself with the black race. 
RB: Oh, oh. You mean—. Okay. 
JS: Obama. 
RB: He had no choice. [Laughs] If he’d of—. 
JS: Yes, but he did, though. 
RB: Yes, he did. 
JS: You have to admire his—. 
RB: He’s as much one—. He’s as much one as the other. 
JS: Let me tell you what I admire. No matter what they do to him, he doesn’t 
come out with bitterness. He comes out giving them a lesson. And some of the times what 
they do to him, I want to go in my self-defense mode. I want to go in there and defend him, 
do something to them. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. 
RB: [Laughs] 
EC: That’s that aggressive self-defense, right? [Laughs] 
27 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
JS: Disrespecting our president. But for once, Raylawni, we have a--. We have a 
man in there that represents us. So, in America, everybody’s represented. We have a biracial 
president. 
RB: And it’s certainly not the color issue. 
JS: It’s not. 
RB: Because Dr. Carter—. Is it Carter? 
JS: Yes. 
RB: I wouldn’t vote for Dr. Carter [Ben Carson] if he was running for dog catcher. 
JS: Buthe’sagood surgeon. 
RB: But he doesn’t even do that anymore. So, you can’t call him a good surgeon 
anymore. He might have been a good surgeon. 
EC: Can I circle back, Ms. Branch? 
RB: Circle. 
EC: When you mentioned Charles Evers and Dick Gregory and bringing the plane 
to Jackson, was that when Mr. Kennard was released at the very end to go to his sister’s? 
JS: The work-up. 
RB: No. We were trying to get the boy who was the state witness—. 
EC: To tell the truth? 
RB: To tell the truth. And he was so afraid. We did get him to Chicago. And they 
took him out to dinner and he said they had—. They put this big steak in front of him, but 
there was a white woman sitting next to him. He couldn’t eat the steak. He said, “I couldn’t 
I couldn’t swallow with this white woman sitting next to me.” [1:00:00] And he left the 
28 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
group with the excuse he had to go to the bathroom or something, and left the group and 
three—and found his way back to Hattiesburg. 
EC: So he was just really afraid. 
RB: He was scared to death. And all these years, he still—. We have a Clyde 
Kennard Day here on campus, we have a Clyde Kennard Day at Mary Magdalene Church 
where he is buried, and he goes to Shady Grove, where—. There’s some very strong people 
that’s come out of Shady Grove. Mr. Dahmer was one of them. He’s never, never talked 
about it. Now, is that out of fear still, or is that out of shame that he didn’t stand up like a 
man? I would have probably been dead. 
I think I was born, as you say, with a mission. I quit school and got the principal fired 
when I was four and a half in Mount Carmel, Mississippi, because he hit me, four times, 
along with three other students, for going in the book house, and we didn’t go in the book 
house. And I kept telling him, “We weren’t the ones that went in the book house. It was 
those other children that ran when you came.” But he called the assembly and whipped four 
of us little tots. Pre-primer, they called it. Pre-primer, where you read “Wee Willy Winkle.” 
I was reading at four and a half, so they said, “Let her go to school.” So I went to school. 
And he whipped me, and when I got my four licks, I walked down those little three steps off 
the stage and just kept walking, and he’s screaming, “Young lady come back here and sit 
down!” and I turned around and I said, “I’m going home and tell my daddy.” And they 
called a meeting at the church that night and he was fired, because he was wrong. I don’t 
care what your color; if you’re wrong, you’re wrong. 
29 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
EC: So I guess that must have been an early lesson for you. I mean, you stood up 
for yourself and then you got backed up. 
RB: I’ve always stood up for yourself. My great-grandmother, who—on my 
daddy’s side—told this story. She had two boys who were Pullman porters. They fought with 
Philip -. 
EC: Randolph? 
RB: Randolph. Philip A. Randolph, I think it is? 
EC: A. Philip Randolph. She would get a pass—. The family would get a pass, 
and she would go somewhere different—California, Washington State—every year, following 
the Federated Women’s Club. And they would have a national convention. And she was one 
of those who could afford to go because she had the pass. And, she said this conductor was 
taking her ticket and called her auntie. And she said she turned and looked at him and said, 
“You know, I don’t know you. I don’t know your mother and I don’t know your father. I’m 
not sister to either one of them. So how am I your auntie?” So, I come up—. There was a 
shotgun at the door. It wasn’t the shotgun you hunted for food, and nobody was to come 
through that door after your family. 
EC: Did you learn to shoot? 
RB: I learned to shoot. Oh yes. I learned to shoot. 
EC: Both of you? 
JS: Oh yes. You can’t live in the country—. 
RB: And not know how to shoot. My mother hunted. And yet, I’m a person 
against guns. I’ve learned, the NRA is a shameful part of America. 
30 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
JS: I love guns. 
RB: I don’t--. There’s one in our house but it’s an antique. I wouldn’t shoot it; 
it’d probably shoot me. [Laughter] 
JS: I believe in self-defense. You know, some things, you know, in—. I 
understand my mission. I understand people who have been inflicted with fear. It’s 
ingrained in them. So in forgiving people, you’ve got to understand, we were blessed to have 
been bom with a mission. Most people don’t have it. That’s why I’m very forgiving. See, 
you didn’t ask to be born white. I didn’t ask to be bom mixed. But we’re God’s children. I 
don’t want to blame anyone for what somebody else’s sins were during that day. If we’re 
going to get along, we’re going to have to learn to [1:05:00] work with everyone, because the 
masses of the people are not like us. They need us to help them, and I want to help them. 
That’s why, in our home up there—my niece stays right next door to me—there’s a gun in that 
room for the four-legged things like them deer taking over their farm, and the two-legged 
ones, too, because you never know what people are up to. And then when you’re down in 
those woods—and we live in a way that’s very private—you don’t know who else is coming 
from the back of the woods. So they know that we defend ourselves. 
RB: Yes. 
JS: So, unlike most people, I like guns. I’m not going to have a gun on my—. I 
don't have a pickup truck, but I don’t want to put it on my rack. I don’t want to do that. But 
I have it for a purpose; I think you have a right to defend yourself, because if you didn’t, I 
wouldn’t be living today. You know, people know that we believe, we have guns, we will 
defend our property.

AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
EC: Was your house ever shot at in the movement? 
JS: Yes, 1968. 
RB: There was so much going on prior to 1964. I left here in [19]66. Mr. Dahmer 
died January 10, [19]66. I finished school here in [19]66 and got a scholarship to St. John’s 
Episcopal School of Nursing, in New York City. But before 1964, we had, god, the hotel 
downtown, Forrest Hotel, we had had—. Judge [Patrick] Higginbotham was the speaker. 
JS: He was. 
RB: We had integrated that. We had gone to a hotel for lunch or breakfast or 
something, out here on Forty-Nine, and I was stealth. Now, you know the word stealth. 
You’re doing things, but you’re hiding as you do it. I was the first person hired at the 
telephone company. They put me on nights and I had no one to keep my children at night. 
My husband was mentally ill and not with me anymore, and I couldn’t take a job where I had 
no one to take care of my children. So I told them I couldn’t take it, but I had made that first 
step, which meant other people made—stepped up. 
JS : They came with you. 
RB: Joyce Bourne Brown, who is now Yarborough, stepped up and went and got a 
job, and that was her job her whole life. She worked at the telephone company. I was the 
first one hired by Sears. Now, this was with the knowing of the NAACP. Somebody had to 
know where you were. So, we knew that there was someone in the group that would tell 
everything, so there was just maybe four or five of us who would plan to do things. And 
there was a place for everyone. Many of the people who did things are dead and gone, will 
never get any recognition. The first clerk hired at Sears. 
32 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
They put me in shipping and receiving so nobody had to look at me, but one day the 
candy girl didn’t come in. I don’t know if you remember Sears and they had the little candy 
shop, the little candy place in the middle of the store? The candy girl didn’t come in. So, the 
cleanup lady was asked and she worked at Sears out here after they moved it to the mall, she 
retired from there. They asked her, “Do you think you can sell candy?” 
So I had made a step and—which opened up a place for other people. I was the first 
one hired by Big Yank, which made—. 
JS: Clothes. Jeans. 
RB: Jeans and shirts. Work clothes. And we went to the permanent press. They 
had four hundred women working, sewing, cutting and sewing. They refused to work with 
blacks. I bugged them down at the unemployment office to the point of climbing across the 
man’s desk [1:10:00] and getting right up in his face. “I know there’s a job up in here 
somewhere for me, other than Miss Anne’s kitchen or working in a restaurant.” And when 
you worked in a restaurant, you couldn’t even work out where the tables were. If you did, 
you only bussed tables and you had to do that with gloves, white gloves. 
They gave the federal book to me, and that’s what woke me up to the fact that I need 
some more education. I had a high school diploma, but that was all. And I had had three 
babies. So, when I went to Big Yank, they finally hired me and they sent me back and forth. 
I’m walking. I don’t have a car. There’s no buses going back from Big Yank over to Walnut 
Street where the unemployment office was. They finally hired me, and the floor walker said- 
-my supervisor said, “Go out and find yourself three other gals to work with you, because 
we’re going to have to put you on evenings. The other ladies won’t work with you.” Four 
33 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
hundred of them. Well, my plan—. I did. Went out and got three others. They ran a whole 
shift with a floor walker, a supervisor, and they had one gentleman who ran this heating 
machine that the clothes went through to become permanent press. And we got in this—. 
And we went and joined the Amalgamated Clothing Union, which was right down the street. 
It’s a Korean church right now. 
We had this competition going. We will press everything you sew. And there was a 
big chute coming from upstairs down, and we’d walk in and we’d see all these shirts in 
bundles of twenty-five, fifty, whatever they were. They couldn’t sew enough shirts during 
the day. Well, we learned how to run those machine-. And the floor walker had told me, 
“You’re machinist number one, but you’re too short to run that machine.” And I started 
looking around and said, “You have a little box?” Stepped up on that little box. We got used 
to doing what we had to do to those shirts. I was the first one to handle them. I pressed the 
body and then the collars and the shirts, and the last, fourth girl pinned them with the paper 
that they put in, the cardboard. 
We got so good. The rule under the union was, if you finished your piece work 
before the eight hours you could still get paid for eight hours but leave. They couldn’t sew 
enough shirts to keep us there more than six hours. 
EC: You must have loved that. 
RB: And we’d strut out at eleven o’clock at night, and Fd walk home. And I 
walked in the shadows because you didn’t want to be out in the light where somebody could 
shoot you, because they definitely would.

Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
EC: You mentioned that when Emmett Till was murdered, that that really was 
shock—. It was your first exposure, I guess? 
RB: It tipped me that I was different, and that Mississippi and other places, even 
Chicago, was a place that maybe you should be afraid, and that people hated you. I had gone 
to a church with my mother, and there was a table similar to this and we were sitting over 
here, and a little boy about four or five years old, maybe, he’d crawl underneath and he’d get 
right there, and he’d look up at me and say, “Nigger. Nigger.” Now, I know the other 
women, who were all white besides me and my mother, at that table, heard that child. They 
never said a word to him. 
EC: Was that in Chicago? 
RB: That was in Chicago. And, I was in Chicago. I picked up Jet magazine and it 
wasn’t on the front cover, was it? Was it the mid, the center fold? Whichever one it was, he 
was in the casket. And it frightened me so much, I threw the—threw down the magazine, the 
Jet magazine, and ran out of the store. And ran all the way home. And I said, “Mama, they 
killed ahoy in Mississippi.” For Mama, it was a—it wasn’t that it wasn’t news. [1:15:00] 
She wasn’t affected, but it set me—. It affected me so much, it said—. And Mama had always 
said, “If they did anything to one of my boys or my husband, I would get jobs at nursing 
homes and hospitals and I would poison up a lot of people.” So, my family—. I’d grown up 
when I was in the country, with the shotgun sitting there. You protected your family. My 
mother had always said, “They better not do anything to one of my boys.” And to see this 
child having that done, because I always said, “You wouldn't take my grandchild out of my 
house. They’d have had to take me that night.” But they lied or maybe the family was 
35 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
afraid, the grandparents, or whatever it was. But they wouldn’t have gotten one of my 
brothers out of the house unless they’d have killed everyone in the house. We had done 
many, many things. Her husband built a clinic here in Hattiesburg. The building is still 
there. He built the clinic because he was a black doctor and the hospital—Forrest General 
Hospital, in—. It was called Methodist Hospital. It’s now Merit Wesley out on 98. They 
would—. If he had a client that needed to go into the hospital he had to turn them over to a 
white doctor. That’s how bad it was. When I—. All three of my babies were bom at Forrest 
General. I don’t know about yours. 
JS: Just one. 
RB: Just one. 
JS: Mm-hmm. 
RB: The charity hospital was up in Laurel, and it was in the basement. You had to 
walk through the furnace room and the laundry stuff to get to where the colored folks were, 
and you could have TB, gunshot, babies bom. Everything was down there in that dark, dingy 
basement with no light. Forrest General, there was a floor. It’s now a hallway on the way—. 
It’s now a hallway on the backside of the cafeteria. Everyone was put there. Because my 
mother was who she was—. Now, let’s see. Felts, who was a white doctor at Hattiesburg 
Clinic, was out physician, and he would give us a five o’clock appointment so we didn’t have 
to go in that little back room and sit and wait until they saw all the white patients. 
EC: You said because your mother was who she was. Can you explain? 
RB: Being a white father and a black mother. 
EC: So the doctor was willing to give her a little privilege because of that? 
36 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
RB: We got privileges. Now, Bill Thacker, Dr. Thacker, was our dentist. His 
house is on the corner of Broadway and what’s that side street? It’s right across from where 
the Catholic high school is right now. 
JS: Southern. 
RB: Big brick fence around that house, and Bill Thacker, his wife, goes to the— 
went to the church until she died, where I go now. And I asked Bill. I said, “Bill, why did 
you all put that big brick wall around your house?” They had two girls, and the Klan had 
threatened them; they were going to kidnap those girls and kill them because he took black 
patients. We had been terrorized for as long as we’ve been here. We have been fighting this 
fight for as long as we’ve been here. It goes on today. 
EC: Can you—. You said that your mother always said that if anybody did 
anything to her sons or—. 
RB: Or her husband. 
EC: Or her husband. Was she—. 
RB: She was going to get revenge. 
JS: She believed in self-defense. 
RB: Self-defense. 
EC: She was more worried about the males in the family? 
RB: Oh, women, we couldn’t go into a restaurant and go to the bathroom or 
anything like that, downtown here. You couldn’t go to a hotel. But, you could get a job 
when your man couldn’t. It was different. [1:20:00] 
EC: Can you explain that for people that didn’t experience it? 
37 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
RB: Oh, gosh. 
EC : You know what F m asking? 
RB: Like your daddy; he worked the farm or hired out to work for somebody 
white. My daddy wasn’t a carpenter. When he went into the navy, he was one of those 
Mississippians who not only could read, but write, and he had beautiful handwriting. So, he 
was trained to be a teacher in the service, an instructor they called it, in service. And they 
only sit people that could boost their numbers, because most whites out of Mississippi at that 
time—and it’s well documented—could not read or write. 
EC: And the military was having trouble, right? Because people weren’t educated 
enough? 
RB: Oh yes, that weren’t educated enough. 
EC: Is this what that was about? Was trying to—. 
RB: And do you know we’re back to that now? Especially out of the state of 
Mississippi? They have a problem recruiting because there’s so many people who can’t— 
young men who can’t read or write? They might have finished school or got a GED. There 
are two types of GEDs. I didn’t realize that. There’s just one where you attend. You get a 
certificate of attendance. And one where you get a high school diploma. 
EC: That’s a new development, isn’t it? 
JS : It’s been there all the time. 
EC: Really? 
RB: 
EC: 
Really? 
We just didn’t know it. 
Okay, because I—yes, I only learned about that recently. 
38 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
JS: But see, their funds end when they’re a certain age. Maybe eighteen? I think 
twenty. They might go up to twenty. They’ve got to get them out of school, so they just pass 
them whether they really passed or not, and then they put them in vocational school. That’s 
the whole idea. 
RB: But you have to read to get even into a vocation. 
JS: Well, they have a system, moving them on and getting that money. 
RB: At one time, but now many companies cannot get workers who can read and 
who can write. And yes, they—. It’s like jail; jail has become a business. 
JS: Right. 
RB: As Jeannette stated, long before the students and the Freedom Riders came to 
town or came to Mississippi and the South, we were fighting. And were very successful. 
EC: I was wondering if you all could tell me about the early NAACP, because you 
were both involved with it, right? 
JS: She went on to nursing school. We were very active on all levels, because 
we’re so active, we’re the largest member in the state. Life members, and in my resume, 
that’s what I dealt with. And I touched on that. So, because of our activities, and we were 
known, Forrest County was a fighting county. That’s why everybody came here. And like I 
was saying, it’s just amazing how they came here. And some of the stories and books that 
are written should be the stories of the people they stayed with. 
EC: Yes, ma’am. 
JS: You know, that’s a shame that they didn’t even give them credit for it, as if 
they just came here, didn’t speak to someone or nothing—. Bothered me more than anything 
39 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
else. They had funds to help them. They never gave them anything on groceries. You 
know, just—. You know, it was just a transfer like they were going to Africa to help the 
Africans, but when you came home, you didn’t really help them because you were eating 
their food. I know when I fed them, you know, and then that was when we had the kitchen 
down on Mobile Street. Miss Campbell, Miss Fairley, and her sister, Miss Bourne, and 
myself, I was down there trying to cook. That’s how I learned to cook. 
RB: Miss Pinky Hall and her sister. 
JS: Pinky Hall. 
EC: So, was this during the summer, so you all had a—. 
JS: This was before. 
RB : Thi s was b efore. 
EC: Was this when the ministers were coming in? 
RB: From [19]62. The ministry started in—. 
JS: Sixty-one. 
RB: Sixty-one. That’s right. You’re right. 
EC: So, you all—. So that was like cooking for the voter registration? 
JS: For the workers. They were hungry, you know, because we knew that the 
people, if they housed them and to keep them safe and nobody bomb their house, they 
probably—. Crops could have been destroyed. They could have lost a lot of things by just 
helping those civil rights workers. [1:25:00] So, we had to organize in the community. You 
had—. The churches were so wonderful. You had summer school, vacation Bible school, 
40 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
and they were cooking at the church. So, what we did, the churches gave us food that we 
began to cook over there on Mobile Street, to feed the workers. 
EC: So you’re saying “we” and “we organized,” right? 
JS: Yes. 
EC: Can you—. 
JS: “We” being the ACP. 
EC: Okay, so the NAACP? 
RB: Even though we married and became COFO, the NAACP led. 
EC: Can I ask, when did you all first learn about the NAACP? Do you remember? 
JS: I’ve known about it all my life. 
EC: You did? Was your family members? 
JS: They were not members. 
RB: Mine were. 
JS: Because we lived in the country. They didn’t have a branch out there. But 
then Laurel had a branch, Dr. Murph. We just never joined. But we supported. We gave 
them money. You know, we always—. When they did the fund drive, we always gave them 
money. 
EC: Was that true for your family too, Miss Branch? 
RB: It was—. I learned that my grand—one of my grandmothers—both of my 
grandmothers, they had stuck their receipts at cheap—the least expensive one, used to be 
fifteen dollars. 
JS: Ten. 
41 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
RB: Ten? Their receipts were stuck in the Bible, and I was going through their 
Bibles and that’s how I found out they were members of the NAACP. 
EC: You know, in Claiborne they used to burn those cards when they would come 
because they were afraid. 
JS: Oh. 
RB: Oh. That someone would get them. I don’t think my grandmother was too 
afraid of the police, and I wasn’t afraid of the police. 
JS: We weren’t. 
RB: And now, now—. Of course, I was just plain listed as crazy. You know, I did 
things because I was crazy. 
JS: But you know what happened? Jones County, being one of those places 
where the Klan was? See, the Klan was like this; they would go to other communities and 
terrorize them. They wouldn’t kill in their own community. They were scared to come out 
there in Jones County because we knew who were behind them sheets. We knew who they 
were. So, my grandfather, we were up there in Soso meeting, and Harley, he put on his sheet 
and went up there and ran all up there. 
EC: [Laughs] 
JS: Because you couldn’t tell him, because he was a mixture of white and Indian. 
EC: So he was infiltrating the Klan? 
JS: He’s infiltrating—. He says, “You know I know you.” He pulled all them 
sheets off their face, and they were going—. They were getting ready to come down in 
Forrest County and raid these people down here because they had so many kin folks up there. 
42 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
They didn’t want to kill their own folk. Well it’s just amazing how terrorists think, you 
know, and those are the same people that, where we live, my father’s people, we’re down 
there with the Musgroves. We’re with all of them. Once the Musgroves came to—they came 
to join Newt Knight’s deserters. That’s how they came—. 
RB: Now, there was a—. Is that the same as Governor Musgrove? 
JS: They were my cousins. 
RB: Oh, okay. Yes, he did tell that to me once. 
JS : Did he tell you that? 
RB: Yes. 
JS: He did? 
RB: Yes, because I was campaigning for him at one time. Musgrove was all right. 
JS: Well, what happened, you know, I was up there in a meeting with him, and 
you know, like I say, you were terrorized. The reason that I survived, I know, my people 
claimed me. Newt Knight is the father on my grandfather’s birth certificate. They claimed 
their children. They gave them land. So, that’s how I survived. I don’t have to worry about 
who I am because, they will tell you, “Oh, that’s my cousin.” 
EC: So they would put the little protection out? 
JS: Yes, you know—. 
RB: Yes. There were certain people you did not mess with. 
EC: Because they had white kin? 
JS: No. 
RB: Because their—. 
43 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
JS: Because Newt would kill them. 
RB: Their daddies and their granddaddies were who they were. 
JS: Newt would kill them. If they messed with any of his people, he would kill 
them. 
RB: There’s a poster, we had it here during one event, back—. Let me see. I first 
got the poster, it was just a flier, two, four six, about six pages, you know, folded in trifold. 
[1:30:00] And, that’s when I learned that my grandfather had gone to register to vote when 
we started registering downtown with Theron Lynd. 
JS: That’s right. I suspected. 
RB: Papa Blue. 
EC: Can you say his full name for the record? 
RB: Lee Val Graves. L-E-E V-A-L Graves, G-R-A-V-E-S. Lee Val Graves. 
EC: So you found the record that he had—. 
JS: We had a picture of him. 
RB: It was a picture. 
EC: Oh, it was a picture? 
RB: Someone had sent the flier to me from Washington, DC. They had a big 
conference in Washington, and he and another guy were standing there at Theron Lynd’s 
counter. The same counter I had gone to to answer my constitution question. I was 
registered first. I was the youngest—. I think I was the youngest one to register in Forrest 
County. 
JS : You probably were. 
44 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
RB: When I got to be twenty-one I went down there, but at that time—. 
EC: What year would that have been? lean—. Was it 68? 
RB: I was born in [19]41, so [19]61, [19]62? 
JS: But I was registered in [19]61. See, Fm a whole [year] older than she. I was 
born in 1940. 
EC: Tell us what it was like to go to register. 
RB: Oh, I had three big men at my back. 
EC: Who did you have? 
RB: Mr. J.C. Fairley, Mr. James Bourne, and Mr. Vernon Dahmer. 
EC: Is that Mr. Bourne, is he kin to Miss Connor? No, Gould. Fm sorry. I’m 
mistaking the names. 
RB: You’re thinking of Peggy Jean Gould, Mr. Gould. 
EC: Yes, yes. My mistake. Yes. So you said it was Mr. Bourne? 
RB: James Bourne. 
EC: Mr. Fairley? 
RB: J.C. Fairley. 
JS : Was it Dahmer going? 
RB: And Mr. Dahmer. 
EC: So they came with you when you—? 
RB: Standing right at my back. See, Theron Lynd, I don’t know if you’ve ever 
seen a picture of him. 
EC: Please describe him for us. 
45 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
JS: Really fat. 
RB: [Laughs] Huge guy, about like this. 
JS: Really fat. 
RB: About six-three, four. But he had a tiny little head, so you had this huge 
person with this tiny little head. 
JS: Probably weighed about four hundred pounds. 
RB: And he would walk back and forth and he would say, “This is your question. 
Can you answer this constitutional question?” And I wrote and wrote and wrote, because 
you know, Miss Chambers had prepared us well on how—on the constitution. And I wrote 
and I wrote, and finally he walks up and takes it and says, and handed it to a clerk, and said, 
“She passed.” He didn’t even read it. 
EC: When you say you were well prepared, was that your school teacher or was 
that a—? 
RB: Schoolteacher. Ms. Marjory Chambers was our world history teacher, and 
she did a lot with us knowing about the Constitution and things like that. 
EC: Was she specifically trying to prepare you to register, or was that part of the 
teaching? 
RB: No, no. That was just part of Miss Chambers’s teaching. In fact, she was one 
of those teachers, when they quote/unquote integrated the schools, they pulled her out of the 
black school and sent her over to the white school because she was a good teacher. And you 
know, there was a law on the books and I don’t know if it’s still there, and I say, people 
should look to see. I should look to see if it’s still there. If there was something that you 
46 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
wanted to do that wasn’t taught in Mississippi, you could be sent out of the state and the state 
would pay the bill. Well—. 
EC: And, I’ll just say for the record, this is before Brown, and this is when they 
were trying to avoid—. 
JS: Integrating. 
EC: —desegregating the schools, and they thought that way they could avoid the 
whole separate but equals. 
RB: Yes. 
JS: That’s how my husband went to medical school. 
EC: Did he? 
JS: Mm-hmm. 
RB: Really? 
EC: On one of those scholarships? 
RB: I didn’t know that. 
EC: Did he goto—. 
JS: Well, he thought he was, but his grandfather was Jewish and they really had 
sent him to school. We didn’t know that until after we were married. He was trying to pay 
his loan back, and they told him. “You don’t have a loan.” So he came down here with Dr. 
Paris because he was trying to pay off the State of Mississippi. And, there was such a need 
for medical care, so he just stayed. Dr. Paris, he couldn’t take it. He had to go back to 
Chicago. 
EC: Where was your husband from? 
47 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
J S : He was from Memphi s. 
EC: Memphis? And so he came here to pay off his school? 
JS: From Tennessee. 
EC: And then stayed? So did he go to Meharry? 
JS: He went to Meharry. [1:35:00] And his sister, and now that we’re talking 
about him it’s amazing. When he first came, he was trying to take the license, to get his 
license, and he had to go up on the freight elevator, but when he got up in there, he took tests 
with everybody else. He said, he was determined when he came back he would integrate 
Forrest General, the county hospital. He made a complaint with HEW [Department of 
Health, Education, and Welfare], he was going to integrate Methodist. He was going to 
integrate them doctor’s office, just as soon as they started taking Medicare, because it’s 
federal money. He was going to integrate everything. And basically, that’s what he did. 
EC: Did he ever work with the Medical Committee [for] Human Rights? Is that 
what it’s called? It was some of the doctors that came into the Civil Rights Movement. Dr. 
[Robert] Smith, up in Jackson. 
JS: Mason? Jackson? 
RB: You remember Marian Wright? She was part of that group. 
EC: Yes. 
JS: I don’t know if he did or not because--. 
RB: He was so busy. 
JS: One thing about that, I think he was trying to do what he had to do. 
48 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
RB: I think when he was working so hard, he eventually became the president of 
the NAACP, but I wasn’t here then. But before I left, he was busy. 
JS : Delivering babies? 
RB: Because in that clinic, as she said, babies were born there. When we got Head 
Start—and that’s a whole other story—I sent a busload of children to Lady Bird Johnson, to 
Washington, to keep until we got Head Start. They kept saying we were—. You know, it was 
a communist movement. And I had made the comment one night to Robert Beech. We were 
on the phone, and I said, “Robert, I’m having a hard time here. I don’t have a care some 
days. I don’t have money to get on the bus. And I have no money to put my children in 
daycare,” I said. And the few daycares, you know, they had to charge. They had a business. 
JS : They had a business. 
RB: And I didn’t have the money. I said, you know what? I ought to send them to 
Washington. If I had the money I could send them to the White House, because she had 
maids and cooks and it’s a big house. 
EC: She can take care of them? 
RB: And Lady Bird can take care of them. 
EC: [Laughs] 
RB: And he called back the next day, and I still don’t know where that money 
came from. He called back the next day and said, “Raylawni, can you—were you serious 
about sending your children to the White House?” I said, “Yes, I was serious, but—.” He 
said, “Can you get enough children to fill up a Greyhound bus?” I said, “To go to 
Washington?” He said, “Yes, and I need women to go with them to take care of the 
49 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
children,” because they were preschoolers. They were five and under. And it was January, 
and we sent those poor children to Washington, DC, without caps and gloves and hats, and it 
snowed. And someone on that end, women met those children with the proper clothing and 
boots and stuff, and I have a picture of my—. Only two of them went because Timothy was 
in school over at Eaton. Sitting on the floor of the House of Representatives. But we sent a 
busload of children. We got Head Start after that. And I was a resource teacher for Head 
Start. 
EC: Wash—. Excúseme. Was it in Mississippi already? Was CDGM [Childhood 
Development Group of Mississippi] in here, or was that— 
RB: No, that was before. 
JS : That was before. 
EC : It was before that? 
RB: We were doing a whole lot of things before. The one thing I learned from the 
students and people coming in—, I don’t have really anything bad to say. I learned that not 
all white people were bad. 
JS: They’re not. 
RB: Up until then, they were devils. They would—. Excúseme. They would stick 
it in any hole. That’s what I thought. 
JS: That’s the sin in people. They need to be converted. 
RB: But we did so much. I give them credit. I learned from them that not all 
people are bad, but as she said, they came for an experience. Now, there was some people 
who went back and did [1:40:00] some wonderful things. Jill Wakeman, who stayed with 
50 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
that lady that lived on the corner of Tipton and some street over there in East Jerusalem. Jill 
Wakeman was her maiden name. She married but she still goes under Jill Wakeman if you 
look her up on anywho.com. She opened the biggest soup kitchen. It’s still running in San 
Francisco, I believe. They had her on 60 Minutes or 48 Hours, or something like that. She 
and a girl of Chinese extraction. Her name was Marian—. 
JS: You can’t remember her name? 
RB: It’s been so long. But Jill I won’t forget because Jill sent ten dollars in an 
envelope to me the year—the two and a half years I was in school in New York, and that’s 
what I lived on in New York City: ten dollars a month. And she opened this food kitchen 
and it’s still one of the biggest food kitchens in America. 
EC: The reason I asked about the Medical Committee for Human Rights was, 
when you mentioned that your husband was determined to integrate those hospitals, because, 
I can’t remember which law it was, but one of those laws that was passed as part of the war 
on poverty was bringing the federal money into the hospitals. 
JS: Ain’t that right. 
EC: And they were using that as the leverage. And so, I just wondered if he might 
have had any contact with them over integrating the hospitals. 
JS: Oh, he did. They were friends of his. He worked with them, Dr. Mason and 
Dr. Smith and all of them. They had an organization among themselves. 
RB: Yes, because there was no one group. 
JS: See, my husband, the people in Laurel were wonderful. They had a black 
hospital. He transferred his patients up there. That’s how he met me. 
51 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
RB: And what was—. What hospital was that? 
JS: The Benevolent Hospital up there in Laurel. 
RB: I didn’t know about it. 
JS: It’s a black—wonderful. My daddy and my uncle had built a church in 
Lucedale, and they contracted pneumonia. So, my first cousin and I went down for the 
dedication of the church. So, these little black doctors were lying there, and my husband was 
single and the other one was married. So, I thought he was—, I was on my way to Dillard 
University, and I wasn’t looking for no husband. So my husband told my daddy, “Now 
that’s the one I want.” 
RB: [Laughs] 
EC : Did he talk to you? 
JS: No, he didn’t say a word to me. Came out to support my first cousin from 
Soso, teaching out in Pascagoula. That’s how they recruited their patients. So anyway, he 
checked. I said, “Oh, I’m so glad you came. You can check my daddy.” Daddy had 
pneumonia, put him dead in the hospital, and so, he was courting me through my daddy. 
RB: [Laughs] 
JS: Because my husband—. 
EC: So you went, too? Was your daddy going to be in trouble if you wasn’t there? 
JS: No, my daddy was trying to get me married off. 
RB: Well, you didn’t talk to the girl first. You talked to the family. 
JS: No, you talked to the dad. So, he was just boosting me up. And I heard him 
in there saying, “Well, if you get her, you get the right woman.” 
52 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
EC : That’s what your daddy said? 
JS: “She might be young, but she’s very mature. She’s been taking care of my 
business and stuff. She been forty when she was born.” So things like that. I’m listening to 
him talking about me. So that’s how I met him, and then I find he was a very nice person, 
you know, and I really liked him. And I should thank my daddy for finding me a husband. 
EC: So did you still go off to Dillard? 
JS: No, I didn’t. I got married within four months. 
EC: Did you miss going off to Dillard? 
JS: Not really, because you know, education is a continuing thing. You don’t 
have to have those letters to know that you are a sponge. 
RB: That you can learn. 
JS: That you are learning everything coming through your way. 
EC: Yes, ma’am. 
JS: And my husband made me see that. Then I went down to William Carey for a 
while, and I had three little children. And it was just hard on me. So my husband was 
saying, “Why are you doing this? You don’t have to have any letters behind your name. 
You’re already my advisor. You’re everybody’s advisor in Hattiesburg.” So, then I said, 
well you know, maybe that’s not for me. But I thought about going back, but like I said, 
education is something, if you have it within you, you just have it. You don’t have to prove 
that to anyone, unless you’re looking for a particular job or something. You know? But I 
never had no problem. I integrated the tax assessor’s office in 1976. 
RB: Yes, you became—. 
53 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
JS: The first black. I worked down there [1:45:00] with Theron Lynd. 
EC: So you got elected in [19]76? 
JS: No, that was my first--. They were hired. 
EC : You were hired? 
JS: I was elected in ninety—I think [19]92, or something. 
EC: Okay, so it’s—. So, who hired you over there? 
JS: Well, you know it was political. 
RB: Yes, everything’s political. 
JS: My neighbor was named Henry McFall. He made sure he integrated 
everybody. If he supported a candidate, he was going to have to have a job out of here. So, 
Mr. [Warren] Byrd hired me because Henry recommended me, and it worked out real, real 
well. 
EC: So, if he was going to get support from the black community for voting, he 
was going to have to hire somebody that was [inaudible] of you? 
JS: Yes, that’s the political payoff. 
EC: So, what was it like to work in the office with Theron Lynd? 
JS: Well, he and I became friends because, see, once he didn’t have that power, 
and then he was a diabetic, and I would come home and eat. And so, he wanted me to go 
down to Mobile Street and get him some food. And I said, “Okay, now if I’m late coming in, 
you better vouch for me.” I would bring him food back, and I wouldn’t get him all the stuff 
he wanted, because he did begin to lose weight. But you know, that’s why you have to do 
forgiveness. He had a job to do. He had to do that to keep his job. 
54 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
RB: To keep his job. Yes. 
JS: He had the Sovereign [Mississippi State Sovereignty] Commission. He had to 
do that. So, he apologized to me. 
EC: He did? 
RB: Oh really? 
JS: For his behavior. He did. I would stop by. He would go in the little- 
downstairs on the right side? 
RB: Mm-hmm. 
JS: And I’d go out there and take me a break and talk to him, because some things 
I wanted to know. 
RB : I would never have thought you would have been Theron Lynd’s friend. 
JS: I was. 
RB: Wow. 
JS: And also know somebody else, that old Klansman down there, a lawyer? 
What’s his name? 
RB: Jimmy Dukes? 
JS: No, not Dukes. He’s all right. 
RB: He’s all right? [Laughs] 
JS: Yes, the one down there behind Jimmy Dukes. The Klansman. 
RB: They were all Klansmen back then. 
JS: But anyway, what happened was, way back I was trying to do my mission 
work, and they had butane tanks in Palmers Crossing before they incorporated, so I was 
55 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
trying to get some gas for these poor people freezing to death. So anyway, I did one-on-one. 
I would go by Mr. [M.M.] Roberts, the one the stadium is named after, all the politicians, and 
I told him, “What I want you to do, don’t give me any money, but go down there to the 
butane company and I want you to put a hundred gallons, and then leave it open. And I’m 
going to refer them to the people that need it.” And it’s amazing how generous they were in 
helping me with people. 
EC: So that was so that people could have fuel to heat their homes? 
JS: They didn’t have any heat. They couldn’t cook. They was cooking on 
butane. 
EC: So you could get the whites, to donate money that way, or to pay for the gas? 
JS: I did. I had one lady—. I can’t even call her name Thacker. She won’t let me, 
even though she’s deceased. I would go by there and she would have me a bag of a thousand 
dollars. 
EC: This is a white lady? 
JS: White lady. And she would call and tell me, I’m never supposed to tell that, 
her name. I would go by these houses, and “Doc, send your little ole wife out here.” You 
know, so she, “I got something for you all.” Because we had to buy food. Had to feed the 
people. 
EC: Is this in the movement? 
RB: There were—. Yes. During those years, late [19]50s to let’s say until I left, I 
know. There were many people—. 
JS: White. White people. 
56 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
RB: What we’d call white people, who were sympathizers, and who was family. 
And, when Robert—. Robert Beech used to go out, and they would meet at midnight or after. 
JS: To get money. 
RB: To get money. But they couldn’t be seen by anybody in the community. 
JS: Could be cash money, too. 
RB: And it had to be cash, of course. 
EC: What would happen to a white person if they publically stood with the 
movement? 
RB: They probably would be killed, or they would never have a job or anything 
like that. 
JS: A recent one, the young man, the clerk for the city? 
RB: Oh, yes. 
JS: You know, they went over and threatened him and he resigned, because they 
didn’t want him to be the clerk for Johnny DuPree. 
RB: Whatman? 
JS: Mr. [Eddie] Myers. 
RB: Oh yes. 
JS: They ran him away. 
EC: He’s African American? 
RB: No. No, no. 
JS : No, he’s a white man. 
EC: I’m talking about Mr. DuPree. 
57 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
RB: Our mayor is a man of color, yes. 
JS: Yes, he is. [1:50:00] 
RB: Lives right down the street. 
JS: It’s amazing—. 
EC: So they didn’t want the white clerk to work for him? 
RB: Well, they didn’t want him to be on his side, and do anything that was going 
to help him. 
JS: He was on his side. 
RB: See, he had enough—. He was in a position where he really knew what they 
were doing, what the bad—. We have some that we really need to get out. 
JS: This is—. 
RB: They just fired—. They gave him such a hard time. 
JS: Well he resigned. 
RB: Yes, he resigned. 
JS: The young man to have it now, he really is a Republican. He’s black, but they 
see that they had to do the same thing that my friend did; make sure that the white 
Republicans gave him that job because he was the most qualified person. So, the legal guy’s 
there now. 
RB: Oh, they’re so upset about that. 
JS : Oh, he’s a nice little guy. 
RB : You’ re talking about Kermit? 
JS: Kermit. 
58 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
RB: Yes. 
JS: I love him. 
RB: Yes. 
EC: When you all went to register to vote, was that when the lawsuit was going 
on? 
JS : Yes. When I went to—. 
RB: That was the second lawsuit. 
JS: This was the second one. 
EC: Yes. 
JS: We did have one really before that, in the [19]50s. 
EC: This is the one that the justice department was part of. 
JS: Yes. This one was from a private attorney out of McComb, the first one in the 
[19]50s. I went in nineteen—. The reason I know it was 1961, because I just made twenty- 
one. I couldn’t register until then. A friend of mine and I, were bowling bad. We weren’t 
going for nobody, we were going by ourselves. So, when we got down there, that old Cajun, 
this constable, I thought he was going to block us. He opened the door for us, said, 
“Everybody just come on in. You can just go in and register.” I said, “Really?” 
RB : And they just let you go in? 
JS: Yeah, because they had filed a suit. The justice department told them to 
register anybody that come in the door. 
RB: Oh, okay. 
JS : We had already regi stered. 
59 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
EC: And they let you? 
JS: Yes, we went in and registered. We didn’t have to take no test or nothing. 
EC: Were you family people, were they registered? 
RB: Isn’t that something? 
JS: My husband refused to register until everybody else did, because they had 
sent for him to come register. They had twelve on record. He said, “I’m not registering until 
all of my people are registering.” 
EC: They were trying to use him to say they weren’t discriminating? 
JS: Yes. That’s what they were saying. 
RB : And there’s always the thought, whether you are black or white, the vote 
really wasn’t for poor folks, ignorant folks. It was only for the gentlemen. 
EC: It was kind of a privilege almost. 
RB: The gentlemen. 
EC: The gentlemen? 
RB: Yes. You were a landowner. You had to be a landowner to be a gentleman, 
and have money. So it was only for gentlemen in the beginning. That’s why I chuckle when 
people say, “Well, the Constitution—.” You know, the Constitution doesn’t mean the same to 
me as it might to you. 
JS: That’s why they got the Willows to register; because they had a lot of land. 
He was—. There was twelve of them. Mr. Berger was one of them. 
RB: Yes, but look at how—who they were. Mr. Berger—. 
JS: I know, they had just a few, just to say that they didn’t discriminate. 
60 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
RB: Yes, just a few. Oh, okay. Yes. 
JS: Well, I like—. I loved Mr. Berger, because it was—. It was Mr. Berger, 
Professor Todd and Mr. Noonkester is the one that integrated. Dr. [J. Ralph] Noonkester. 
RB: Yes, they got together to integrate. 
JS: They did. 
RB: Quote-unquote integrate Wesley—I mean, William Carey. But we didn’t—. 
There was no—. 
JS : They paved the way, though. 
RB: They didn’t—. Yes. 
JS: They were the background people. See, in the movement, you had different 
kinds of people because you had to communicate with them. You had the biracial committee 
out to boycott. So, some people could communicate with others, and could get them to do—. 
The movement people were so bold in everything, they were so demanding, until the people 
that had to make the change, all those merchants, they were afraid of them. 
RB: When people like Stokely Carmichael, who became [Kwarne] Ture, came to 
town, and there was a mass meeting. Any time any of those kinds of people would come in, 
there would be a mass meeting. They were what we considered really radical. You know, I 
would go down and I had a pee-in once. Excuse me again, sir. 
Ml : My ears are burning. 
RB: We had gone up above Jackson there, [1:55:00] and we planned to take up an 
Air Force base up in North Mississippi, which we did, but I told them, I can’t, because I have 
three children I have to take care of. I need to stay alive. And I really believed that the 
61 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
United States would kill them all. I just thought, when they get on that base they’re going to 
kill them. But they froze them out. And the—. On the way back from that particular 
meeting— 
JS : Was Father Gwynn with you all? 
RB: Who? 
JS: Father Gwynn. Was he there? 
RB: Yes. He might—. Yes. 
JS: He integrated everything, this Catholic priest, and those children. 
RB: He would tell a lot of stuff, too. He was a stoolie. He—, I stopped at a service 
station. Children had to go to the bathroom. It was me and one of those singing boy—Watts 
girls. She lived down on Mobile Street. Mary? Anyway, she was one that went to 
Washington with the children, and the children had to go to the bathroom. We stopped at 
this little service station and I asked for the key. And he said, “Why? Ain’t no lock on the 
washroom back there for the colored folks. You see it back there?” I said, “I want the key to 
the ladies room, right there.” He said, “Oh no, you can’t use that. That’s for white folks 
only.” And I said, “Children, pee right there.” And we peed. I had them all pee in the door. 
We had a pee-in. 
EC: What’dhedo? 
RB: “I can’t believe she—do you see what she—what?” 
JS: They had to go to the bathroom. 
EC: You reckon he gave the next person the key? 
62 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
RB: I said, “Now, the next time someone asks for that key, you give the key to 
them, and you won’t have a pee-in.” 
EC: You wasn’t worried? 
RB: No. 
EC: No? 
RB: No. 
EC: You didn’t have sense to be worried? 
RB: I didn’t have sense enough to be afraid. 
JS: But she had a mission. Em telling you. 
RB: I didn’t have sense enough to be afraid. 
JS: There was a—. It was a mission. 
RB: People ask that question about us coming out here. “Weren’t you afraid?” 
We did everything we could to get rid of the bodyguards after we find out one of them was 
the guy that tried to kill me once, back in [19]62. I said, “Elaine, one of the bodyguards is 
that police officer that tried to kill me.” Well, I guess not many people could tell a story like 
this now, because they will kill you, but he—, I was getting my children from my 
grandmother’s. My husband and I had gone to the movies. About ten o’clock at night. 
When I went to knock on the door, this thing jumps up out of the dark at the edge of the 
porch, cuts the screen, opens the screen, and kicks in the hard door. And, my husband was so 
afraid of white people. I mean, I didn’t have that fear. He did. 
JS: But he did. 
63 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
RB: And, two of the children were in a bed over in the corner, and he had Johnny, 
who was six months old. I remember it so well. Johnny was bom in April and it was 
October. And, my husband said, “Hurry up!” And he took—. The police officer backhanded 
him with his flashlight, and it just missed my baby’s head. Well you know, I was mad as a 
hatter. I said, “Why don’t you hit somebody that’s not holding a baby?” And he was a big 
guy. He picked up a small lamp table next to my great-grandmother’s bed, hit it up against 
the wall and broke it, and come at me with the leg. 
Well, I had long hair then, but I had it in a bun up on top of my head, and when he hit 
me that cushioned, but I scared him by running into him. And I was 94 pounds and he was 
about 300. And he fell on me and we fell back on the bed. And I could feel this gun, and it 
wasn’t locked—it wasn’t locked in the scabbard. I pulled that gun out and I stuck it in his 
belly. I said, “If you don’t get off of me, I will shoot you,” and his partner pulled a gun on 
everybody else. I said, “Do you think—. There’s five boys standing up here and two men 
and several women. Do you think they’re going to ever let you get out of here? We will cut 
you up in little bitty pieces and put you in that toilet hole out there, and we’ll take that car 
and [2:00:00] drop it in the river. So you best get off of me.” He backed up off of me. I 
said, “Now we can go downtown and call the chief.” And we went downtown to—. The old 
police station is in City Hall, and I got on the phone and called the White House. They said, 
“When you get into trouble, call the White House.” I believed it. I called the White House. 
And, the attorney general got on the phone. Who was it then? Oh help me out here. This is 
[19]62. 
EC: Kennedy? Robert Kennedy? JohnDoar? Were you talking to—. 
64 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
RB: No, it wasn’t Kennedy. Kennedy was after that. Anyway, the attorney 
general got on the phone and I said, “I am Raylawni Young. I am at the police station in 
Hattiesburg, Mississippi, and a police officer tried to kill me.” And I could hear the 
operators laughing on the phone. They were listening from right here in Hattiesburg. 
Because they said, “You want what?” I said, “I want the White House and I want it right 
now. We’re supposed to—. I’m supposed to call the White House right now.” That was the— 
. That’s how we knew the boys were dead up there in Meridian, because if you didn’t call 
when you got where you were going, no, you’re dead. They said, “Get this crazy woman out 
of here.” They took me home with my three children and arrested my husband, who hadn’t 
done a thing. 
EC: What kind of things were you involved with at that point in the movement? 
What were you—. 
RB: After that? Everything. 
EC: Well what were you doing before that? 
JS : So much going on. 
RB: There was so much going on. But after that, I was officially on the books as 
the president—as the secretary of the NAACP of Forrest County. I went and joined. I had 
never paid that money. Supported but had never paid that money. I joined the NAACP. 
Later on I worked with all those groups that became COFO, because, you know, we were 
doing one thing, they were doing another. But when people came to town, like Ture, who 
were very, very radical, we would say, you know, Hattiesburg is not for you. 
65 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
EC: Is that after the Meredith march, or would this be like during the 
[19]63,[19]64, [19]65? 
RB: Yes, that was that time frame, when people—. 
JS: The marching really escalated after the death of Medgar Evers. And then 
when Mr. Charles came down. He was so mad with everybody. You know, he had them two 
guns on him. Whenever Charles Evers, he had Deacons for Defense everywhere to the 
protected people. Now that’s when white people really got scared because he was crazy. 
RB: No, he wasn’t. He wasn’t any crazier than I was. 
JS: But I’m saying—. They’ll say you’re crazy. 
RB: But he did. Yes, they’ll call you crazy and supposedly let you get away with 
stuff. 
JS: He went out to this little motel. He got out there. He said, “What am I doing 
out here? I’m integrated now.” Said, “Tell them children that, get on their broom now. I’ve 
got to come in. I’m sleeping.” I said, “Mr. Evers, you’re going to put the children on the 
floor again?” “Yes, ma’am.” 
EC: So you’re telling me he would go integrate the hotel and then he’d come—. 
JS: Sleep at my house. 
RB: Leave and come—. He knew where he was safe. [Laughter] 
JS: He wants some black person, and the children know. They knew what to do. 
See, I had twin beds and I had the one bed, but my son’s bed, he slept in my son’s room. So 
my son had to sleep on the floor in the—with the girls. So anyway, that was his room. He 
wanted some breakfast. He would go to show out and integrate, and have them guns on him. 
66 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
And I felt so safe. I said, “This is a man after my own heart. He said if anybody bothered us, 
he’s going to go through and mow them down.” Ain’t that impressive? 
RB: Mm-hmm. I’m the last one. I’m the last one living now in Hattiesburg that 
went to the March on Washington. 
JS: I was going to--. 
RB: Veri and died. 
JS: Right. I couldn’t go because I had—. 
RB: Well, you were like me. I got someone to keep the children there, but I had—. 
JS: I was going to go with that Farrakhan group, but they said—. They told me 
that they had a bus. A sensible bus out of McComb. And I checked on it. 
RB: Oh, I went out of Greenville. 
JS: I checked on it. They didn’t have it. So I was not. I put them on [2:05:00] a 
van, over at that rental van over at Deermont. They could get in the van. I wasn’t going with 
them. 
EC: Did either of you all ever meet Medgar Evers when he would come through? 
When he was here? 
RB: Oh, yes. We knew Medgar. 
EC: You want to tell us about him? 
RB: Medgar? Oh gosh. 
JS: He would be at that drug store I was at. 
RB: He was our field secretary and he was—. 
JS: At the drug store all the time. 
67 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
RB: He was very, very--. He was a gentleman. He was mild. 
JS: Very articulate. 
RB: But serious. But very serious. 
JS: A scholar-type person. 
EC: Was he organizing a youth branch in Hattiesburg at that time? I know there 
was one near Palmers. 
RB: There were youth branches associated with every chapter. It’s always been. 
JS: We had one. 
EC: Were you all a part of that? 
RB: No, we were old ladies. [Laughs] 
JS: We were young. We were just twenty-one. 
RB: We were young and had children. 
JS: When I first got married I was just nineteen. 
RB: I was eighteen. 
JS: And then we lived in Palmer’s Crossing down by the lumber company. And 
somebody said, “Aren’t you all scared?” And I said, I think I’m waiting on them, if they 
come. So I was in the house when they threw their skunk in my yard. And they said they 
were around there still. I said, “Okay. Come around. So you do know where I live, right?” 
“Yes, we know where you live.” I said, “Well I’m waiting for you. Come on.” And they 
never showed up. Same thing with the little clock start ticking. You know, you call us and 
we got the doctor’s exchange. So they would answer the phone for us. They had arrested us 
when we first came here. Reverend Willow didn’t want us to join until we joined his church. 
68 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
He didn’t want us to be part of the movement, so we had to move our membership over to 
United Methodist Church of St. Paul. 
EC: Why did he—. What did he say to you all? 
JS: He didn’t want this church to be burned. They had just burned down the 
Catholic hall. He was of that age, you know, he feared that they would destroy—. He had a 
whole lot of stuff. 
RB: There weren’t but about six ministers that supported what some people called 
“The Movement.” 
JS: Just a few. 
RB: Just a few. Ponder. 
JS: St. Paul. Ebenezer [Missionary Baptist Church], 
RB: [E.E.] Grimmett from St. Paul. Was it Radiow? The pastor that was at—. 
JS: True Light? 
RB: True Light. 
JS: Just a few. 
RB: And St. James. Just a very few. Zion Chapel. 
JS : They were afraid that they would burn their church. 
RB: And they would have. I mean, they—. 
JS : They would have. 
RB: Yes, they would have. 
JS: That was the Deacons for Defense that kept them from doing that, from 
Bogalusa they came up and guarded us. 
69 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
RB: But I thought that the few pastors that did, that let us use their church for mass 
meetings, and then in [19] 64 for Freedom Summer. I see Freedom Summer totally 
differently than many people. 
EC: Can you tell us about that? 
J S : Who wrote that b ook? 
RB: Well, it was a summer. It was just, you know, an event that happened, where, 
as she said, we lived it every day. 
JS: See, they came in. They would have Vacation Bible School. 
RB: McAdam. DougMcAdam. 
JS: The workers from the movement, when COFO, when they all came together 
and they sent everybody everywhere, mostly they were teachers, musicians, and they 
integrated the libraries, stuff like that. So, the churches—. Some of the churches, Mt. Zion, 
they really didn’t know that they were doing all of that, because they were in vacation Bible 
school, and they lasted all summer. They worked out of little churches. You had all kind of 
people who came here. But Hattiesburg was like, if you came in, we protected everybody 
and they felt safe staying with us. 
RB: But now, northern Mississippi are totally different. Northern Mississippi and 
west Mississippi, like over at McComb, was different. 
JS: Right. 
RB: Where, in Forrest County, Jones County, we’d fight back. 
JS: We would. 
EC: Can you tell me about Mr. Dahmer? 
70 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
JS: Well, Mr. Dahmer, that I remember, one of his wives, his first wife, was 
related to me. And, [2:10:00] I had known the Dahmers. When I was a little girl I used to 
stay with my great, great-uncle, who lived down the street. And I was very familiar with Mr. 
Dahmer and his family, because Fd caught myself, when I was about thirteen, liking one of 
the sons. And he said, “You can’t do that. That’s your cousin.” 
RB: You’re cousins. 
JS: And I said, “Well, Mr. Dahmer, am I kin to everybody?” He said, “Just 
about.” 
RB: Yes, I couldn’t marry anybody from out there. 
JS: If they look like us, you better check them out. 
RB: Yes, check them. 
JS: So, anyway, I have known him all of my life. He was just a kind of person 
that would help everybody, black and white. He was a businessman. He had a lumber mill, 
and he was, you know, a farmer. He would share with people, his crops and stuff. He just 
wanted to register to vote. 
RB: I think he was the first man of color here in Forrest County, or first man 
period, to own an automatic cotton picker. 
JS: That’s right. 
RB: He paid more for people who picked cotton for him. 
JS: Worked for him.

RB: That worked for him on his farm. I didn’t know his first wife, but I knew his 
first children. One of them is still living, Vernon. And the other one died. But, the night—. 
February the 10th, 1966 was the day he died. 
EC: January? 
RB: January 10, 1966. I was here. And that day I told Dr. Fish, he was our 
advisor and plus the work-study we had to work for him because nobody else would have 
anything to do with us. I told him, “I can’t come to work today.” That morning—. That 
night before, Mr. Dahmer, they had a little grocery store. One of his aunts, Aunt Raney, slept 
in the store. And, he had sent two boxes of groceries by his sister, Mrs. Beard, and Mrs. 
Beard’s daughter, Lorna. She was about twelve years old at the time. So, this was before 
midnight, so that would have been the 9th of January. He knew I was having a hard time. 
And I had gone to the Catholic church and asked for some food, and they had refused food. 
There was something not right at that time at that Catholic church. And, the next morning 
about five-thirty, I decided—. I said, “I’ve got to call Mr. Dahmer and thank him for this food 
before I get started on my day,” because some days I walk from the river here, and I had an 
eight o’clock class and had three babies to try to get some peanut butter and jelly on some 
sandwiches and leave at a cousin’s house on the corner, and then Timothy went on to school 
at Eaton. And, they fire bombed his house that night, and he was at Forrest General. Now, I 
had asked some physicians since then, why they didn’t put him on a respirator, and they said 
they only had two and they were in use. I don’t know if that’s the truth or not. But I was 
halfway between here and the hospital, walking on the service road, and someone stopped 
and said, “If you’re going down to the hospital to see Mr. Dahmer, he’s dead. He died.” 
72

Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
That family is very special. They are one of many special families all over this 
country, really, and if we don’t stop and change the language from black and white, this 
whole world is just going to implode. We have to stop. We have to recognize each other as 
humans, all of us. What’s going on now in the Middle East, I would say, “You two better go 
and get some DNA done because you’re probably cousins.” And it’s all over money. I spent 
twenty-six years in the military, and until I got back to Mississippi—, I knew my career was 
up at lieutenant colonel when I got back to Mississippi because [2:15:00] of the person who 
was in charge. You run into these people everywhere; they’re not just in Mississippi. I 
wouldn’t go anyplace else to live. Would you live someplace else now? 
JS: I choose to stay here. 
RB: I choose Mississippi. 
JS: I love it. 
RB: I got called a nigger by a Cuban in Miami, and I had never been—. I’m sitting 
on my front porch and this big-wheeled trunk comes around. They’re flying a Cuban flag 
and call me a nigger in Spanish? I said, “I’m moving back to the United States,” and we 
moved back to Hattiesburg in ninety—in [19]88. I choose to live here. I choose to get along 
with people. I choose to love people. Those are my choices. 
JS: Also, accept differences. I like different cultures, and I think we all can get 
along. If I respect your culture and you respect mine, then you wouldn’t have these labels. 
You know, you can learn from a lot of cultures. Because people think that I’m Spanish, and I 
told my granddaughter, who is half Spanish, she wants to teach me Spanish so I know what 
they’re talking about. So, anyway, at first I was kind of offended, until my son told me, 
73 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
“They’re going to speak their language. They don’t—. They’re not doing that to offend you, 
but you need to learn their language.” But they understand me. 
They’ll try, you know, and one thing about their culture that I really like, I like to 
cook and I like food. When I go to visit my son, they turn the kitchen over to me. She’ll 
come in, my daughter-in-law, and wash dishes and assist me, but she wants the American 
cooking, so I like the Spanish food. So, of the different cultures, I think we can accept each 
other and learn from each other, but if I respect you as a person, then I’m going to give you 
that love that comes from above. I’m going to treat you right. I’m not going to do those 
things—that fear that’s in people, it’s going to take a long time to come out because I don’t 
have any problems with anyone, but a lot of people do. A lot of people feel that there’s a 
difference, that one race is better than the other one. There’s no such thing. People are 
people, and when you—. They love their culture and they just want to retain their culture. 
But if we respect it, like I said, I learned—. I don't know what I would do without the black 
culture, because they really accepted me. 
RB: Well, I love—, I respect people’s different cultures, but I think if you make a 
choice to come to America, you should at least respect my flag, number one, and that’s the 
American flag. If you want to be an American, I don’t care what you do at home. I think, 
that’s the culture you’re talking about. 
JS: I’m talking about the culture, different cultures. 
RB: In the kitchen, the different foods and—. 
JS: The different cultures in America. 
74 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
RB: But I don't believe a Muslim man has a right to cut his daughter’s throat 
because she’s kissed a boy and not married. And there are a lot of those cases in court here 
in America because they want to maintain the way their culture they’ve been in all their life, 
but this is America. You made a choice to come here. 
JS : That’s illegal here. 
RB: Yes. It’s illegal. Well, it’s more than illegal; it’s just not right. And I think if 
you want to live in a place where you do those things—. Of course, it’s in Leviticus, but I 
think they ought to rip out the first five books, Torah, and burn it. That’s what I think. But, I 
love people. I don’t care what your religion. 
JS: I’m doing better about that because I’m trying to understand other religions 
and their practices and see how that relates to me, because it’s amazing when I can talk to 
them. I’m a Christian. I don’t have any problem with that. [2:20:00] If you’re a Muslim and 
you’re not the one that’s believing the violence. 
RB: The Shia or the Sunni. 
JS: I’m with you. But, I’m learning so my mind is so broad now. I’m learning to 
get along with them, just like I would not offend my little Muslim cousins because I wanted 
to put up a wreath because they don’t believe in Christmas. They don’t have Christian 
beliefs in Christ, but I just wanted to be with my Christian decoration. So, what I told him 
and the wife, I said, “What you all need to do now, that has nothing to do with you. I’m 
disabled. I want to put that wreath up there.” [Laughter] I said, “So what you need to do, 
you’re not engaged in my practice. I’m just asking you to put the wreath up there.” So I got 
to teach Jehovah’s Witnesses the same thing. And I said, Well what’s wrong with that, 
75 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
Sandra? Could you help me get—look up there on the shelf and just get those little ornaments 
down for Christmas?” 
EC : Help you out with that? 
JS: Yes. So, she finally, she said, “You’re just as right as you can be. That has 
nothing to do with me. I’m just doing you a favor.” That’s understanding and 
communicating. Now, he wants me—. They’re just so concerned about pork, the Muslims. 
Now, when the Lord died for our sins, there are no unclean food. So, if I believe in that and I 
can show you where it’s biblical, I said, you have to take some of my beliefs, because I’m 
going to eat a little pork every now and then. It might not be good for me, but I’m going to 
do it. 
RB : There’s nothing wrong with it if it’s fresh. 
JS : That’s right. And if it’s clean. 
RB: And there was a reason all of that was written. You have to take the context. 
JS: Ido. 
RB: But they’re just living in the one through five century. 
EC: Can I ask you a quick question? Do you remember any of the SNCC people 
that were coming through? 
JS: Oh yes. 
RB: Yes. 
EC: [Lawrence] Guyot and [Avon] Rollins and Curtis [Hayes]? 
RB: We know all of them. 
JS: Yes. 
76 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
RB: We meet every spring in Lawrence. 
JS: Let me tell you something about that Guyot. I was the supplier. They came by 
my house and they didn’t have no money, they didn’t have things that’s necessary for— 
personal things. Make sure they had deodorant and stuff. So they came by one day, and I 
was so pregnant—I was about eight months—I couldn’t drive my little Volkswagen. So, 
Guyot was saying, “You know, Miss Smith, that little Volkswagen’s just sitting there. I 
could really use that.” I said, “Well, are you twenty-one?” 
RB: That’s Guyot. 
JS: I said, “Now, Doug is not twenty-one.” 
RB: Yes, Doug was a teenager. 
JS: “I don’t even know you.” I said, “But anyway, I’m going to trust you.” So, I 
let him have my little Volkswagen. They took it to New Orleans and burned up the motor. 
RB: [Laughs] Run it out of oil. 
JS: They did. So, the SNCC bought me another motor. So, I said, “When you all 
get through tearing it up, I’m going to buy me another car because I’m not going to be able to 
drive a little stick-shift.” 
RB: Now, we worked very well here together in Hattiesburg. 
JS: We did. Everybody did. 
RB: SNCC, CORE. I remember [James] Farmer came here once, out of Brooklyn. 
JS: He did. 
RB: SNCC, CORE, SCLC, Student Non-Violent. That was King. 
JS: Right. Julian Bond. 
77 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
RB: And we married and became COFO and worked together. 
JS: We had to unify because we were all doing the same thing. 
RB: Yes. No point in being different. We needed to know where each other was. 
JS: Jointly. 
RB: When the spirit, our defensemen, needed to know where they needed to be. 
EC: Who were some of the people that you worked most closely with in that 
context? 
JS: All of them. 
RB: All of them. Gosh, they were here--. 
JS: They were in our homes and stuff because you didn’t have integration. Like, 
when somebody came through, they were hungry, you had to go in there and cook for them. 
RB: And there was no—. They couldn’t go into anyplace. They couldn’t go to 
hotels, they couldn’t go to restaurants. 
JS: You had to house them. 
RB: Yes, you had to. I think Johnny May Walker. Pete Seeger slept on her floor. 
JS: Sure did. 
RB: John O’Neal, Southern Theater. [2:25:00] He did Pnrlie Victorious over at—. 
JS: Mt. Zion. 
RB: Mt. Zion. And when I went to New York and brought my children to New 
York, we went to Broadway to see Purlie. They called it Pnrlie on Broadway. We played—. 
I bought the long playing album. We played it until it had grooves in it, because it made us 
feel at home, because when they were just little, John O’Neal—I call him the Rooster- 
78 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
moving on up? What was his name? Melba Moore, Cleavon Little, John O’Neal. The one 
that had the show on TV that, it was a—. Maude kicked off from it. In the Heat of the Night 
sheriff. O’Connor. Caroll O’Connor. But the guy—. 
EC : Was he in In the Heat of the Night? 
RB: Not—well, there were the movie stars. They usually never got past Jackson or 
the big cities. 
JS : But they came here. 
RB: Yes, some would—they would come here. But the Pur lie Victorious that they 
did—. Meathead. He called his son-in-law Meathead. 
Ml: [Inaudible.] 
EC: Oh no, All in the h'amily? 
RB: No. All in the Family called his son-in-law Meathead. But the Jeffersons that 
lived—/iOc Jeffersons. What was the guy that played Mr. Jefferson? 
EC: Hemsley? 
JS: Hemlsey? 
RB: Something-Hemsley? 
EC: Sherman? 
RB: Sherman. Sherman Hemsley. He was one of those players. 
EC: He was part of the Free Southern Theater? 
RB: And did Purlie Victorious right here in Hattiesburg. Yes. 
EC: I didn’t know that. 
RB: Yes. 
79 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
JS : That’s amazing, like Dick Gregory. 
RB: Oh yes, Dick Gregory would come. F11 never forget hearing Peter, Paul and 
Mary sing in 1963. 
EC: At the March on Washington? 
RB: Yes. 
EC: Yes. 
RB: They did not come here, but Aaron Henry used to recite many of their songs. 
How many miles must a man walk down. How many white doves. He would recite it. 
JS: Dr. Henry was very a very religious man. 
RB: Before Charles Evers and Medgar—. No, Roy used to come. He was national. 
Roy Wilkins was national. 
JS: He’s been in my home, with Higginbotham. 
RB: Judge Higginbotham, yes. Judge Higginbotham was our guest speaker at the 
Forrest Hotel. That was the first time we had ever gone to the Forrest Hotel. My mother 
worked as a chambermaid at Forrest Hotel before we left, when I was just a wee baby. 
JS: I remember that well. It’s just so many barriers that we’ve broken down. I’m 
just so glad that God put me here during this period where I could be a part of change. 
RB: And yet, we’ve remained the same. 
JS: Right. 
RB: Our schools are segregated. I did not think—. I really felt that if we sent our 
children to school, that they would teach them the same, but they don’t. They still don’t. 
There could be twenty students. If half of them are one thing and the other half the other, 
80 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
some are going to get it because it’s done in their—a way that they understand it. The others 
are not going to get it, and that’s because of those different cultures. You have to be cultural 
when you’re teaching, and you have to do it in three different ways for people to remember. 
I can’t think—. I think we have one—no, we have two whites in our band at Hattiesburg High. 
Two. That’s pitiful. [2:30:00] One of those goes to the same church I do. 
Before I even joined the church, we had a luncheon and they were discussing moving 
West. And I listened, because I really didn’t know anything about anybody there. I didn’t 
know who was rich, who wasn’t rich, who was—, I knew the doctors because I worked at the 
hospital. And I told them. They were going to build a separate building out west for their 
children. And I said, “Now, I hear all these stories. Your grandmother, it was Methodist of 
the South.” United—it wasn’t United. It was Methodist Church of the South. “Your 
grandmothers got married here, your mothers got married here. Your babies were baptized, 
you were baptized here.” I said, “Now, if you build a building out there for your children 
and they’re going to have their youth church and all that out there, they’re not going to feel 
the same about this building. So, if you plan to move, you might as well build a church out 
there and go on and be honest.” And they decided to stay. 
And I’ve been there almost twenty years, eighteen years or more. Twenty. And the 
same, you know. Some people left, but we’re right back. Churches aren’t as segregated. We 
have some people of color. And the one thing about culture that I don’t like that we do, 
churches do, they’ll have—. We have one church where the Baptists meet during the day and 
the Chinese meet at night. How about everybody come at the same time so the Chinese can 
81 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
learn English faster, you can learn some Chinese maybe, and you’re American. I don’t 
believe in the separateness. 
When the Spanish came, mostly Mexicans after Katrina, and Red Cross was giving 
away money, you know they showed up like white on rice. And, there would be eight or 
nine sleeping on the floor without a sheet in order to be in place to get money from Red 
Cross. It made me go to work for Red Cross, and I worked for Red Cross long enough to get 
some retirement out of it. But, I just don’t believe in separateness. 
If I’m in your home, I’m going to eat what you cook, and I expect you to do the same 
in my home. Now, if it’s something you really don’t like, or you’re allergic, or you just can’t 
stand it, I can’t eat bloody octopus. I can’t get it past my nose. I can’t eat horsemeat sushi. 
That horse smell, I could smell that horse. I can’t eat it. But I can eat all the other sushi. 
And when I’m in Japan or Germany, I try to speak what little language I can. 
But, love, as Jeannette says, love takes all of those differences away. And some 
things have happened to me that is, some people might say supernatural, and I don’t even 
know how it happened. But I was in Bolivia one year, and the preacher was preaching in— 
he was praying in— Aymara, and we were all a group and we were holding hands. And we 
all understood what he was saying. And after he finished the prayer, we all said amen, we 
looked at each other and I said to my husband, “Did you understand what he said?” He said, 
“Yes, did you understand him?” I said “Yeah.” And we started asking, and we all 
understood what he was saying and he was speaking in Aymara. So, love—. If we loved 
each other, we don’t love each other. Even our creed says race. So, if you say race to me, 
82 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0112 
Raylawni G. Branch and Jeannette Smith 
that means you believe in different races. So, what--. How can Mexican be a race? It’s 
[2:25:00] a—. You know, they speak Spanish. 
JS: It’s a culture. 
RB: That’s a culture. That’s a cultural thing. So you isolate it and you learn the 
dialect of Spanish, and then when the Spanish came over, just like when people from Africa 
were brought over here and enslaved. We were never slaves. I like that. I like that concept; 
we were never slaves. We were enslaved. 
JS: You know, for me to accept myself and move on, when I know exactly who I 
am and what I am, when I got to that point in my life, I became a changed person, and I 
accept all the differences and I try to understand them, but I know that— 
RB: Them you mean whites? Or do you mean anybody? 
JS: Anybody. 
RB: Okay. 
JS: I’m talking about anybody, because I’m really not hung up on—. 
RB: I’m not hung up on black and white, no. 
JS: On white or black. I say white people, but I’m not really saying it in a 
derogatory term, because I really don’t have any problems loving anyone, and I’ve always 
been that way. 
EC: I have more questions, but I think this is actually a really good moment to 
stop. 
RB: Okay.
