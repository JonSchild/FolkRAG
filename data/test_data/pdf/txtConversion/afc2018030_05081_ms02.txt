A display of pottery made by Mark Nafziger at Brush Creek Pottery, including platters, pitchers, jars, mugs, and 
casseroles.

Two platters made by Mark Nafziger on display at Brush Creek Pottery. Like most of his production line, these 
have slip trailing decoration. The glaze is sprayed on in such a way that it fades from blue to orange where it is 
thicker/thinner.

A display of wood fired and salt glazed pottery made by Mark Nafziger at Brush Creek Pottery. These pieces are 
not from his main production line, but he does make and sell some pieces like this on a regular basis.

A display of pottery made by Mark Nafziger at Brush Creek Pottery. Through the window, you can see some of 
the other buildings at Sauder Village, which houses a number of different craftspeople making objects that are 
both historical and contemporary.

A finished mug sitting near some mugs that have the slip trailing decoration applied, but have not yet been fired. 
The finished mug is a slightly smaller model than the unfinished ones, but has the same pattern of decoration.

Mark holds up a finished mug near other mugs that are still in process. The unfinished mugs to the right have the 
slip trailing decoration applied, and the mugs to the left have glaze applied. Once they are fired, they will look 
like the finished piece that he is holding.

This photo shows Mark’s wheel, which is raised up so that he can stand while he throws pots. The door to the 
right of the photo is the main entrance to Brush Creek Pottery; this setup allows Mark to see and interact with 
customers while he works.

These electric kilns are used to bisque fire pottery, a step that makes the clay more stable before the slip and glaze 
are applied.

This photo shows part of Mark’s work space. The upright, labeled containers hold dry glaze materials, and pull 
out for easy access. At this stage the materials are still dry and powdery, a similar consistency to flour. He will 
add water after they are mixed, and the glaze will be applied as a liquid.

This photo shows part of Mark’s storage space. The bags hold a variety of materials that he uses in his glazes. 
They are dry and powdery, a similar consistency to flour.

This is Mark’s spray booth. He sprays glazes onto the pottery, and the booth helps to keep the extra glaze from 
spreading around his studio.

Shelves of decorated but unfinished pots sit in Mark’s studio. Visitors can see nearly all parts of the process.

The foreground of this photo shows pots that are in process; some have slip trailing applied, others have glaze 
applied. The white bricks in the background are the door and floor of Mark’s car kiln. He loads the kiln here, and 
then slides it along the tracks in the floor to close it. 
 
afc2018030_05081_ph14.jpg 
This photo shows Mark’s gas kiln, where he does the glaze firing for all of the pots in his production line. The 
tracks in the floor allow the door and floor of the kiln, which are on wheels, to roll in and out of the kiln, making 
loading and unloading much easier.

Pottery.

This is Mark’s wood kiln, which was built directly outside of his studio building. He only fires this kiln a few 
times per year. He does not fire all of his pots in this kiln; his main production wares are fired in his gas kiln.

This beam in Brush Creek Pottery is adorned with the clay handprints and names (also written in clay) of many 
the assistants who have helped Mark over the years.
