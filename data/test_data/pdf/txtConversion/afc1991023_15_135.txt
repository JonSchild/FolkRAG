Introduction to the Blueberry Slide Series: CDMO15—CDMO20 
Our farm is located in two locations in the Pinelands National 
Reserve: 
Chatsworth and Retreat. 
The Chatsworth location consists 
of twenty acres and was cleared by my Grandfather Thompson 
and my father. 
The other location is Retreat and 
is 
located 
outside of Vincentown where my family lives. 
The slides do not 
show two important aspects of the business. 
First the ethic 
diversity of the pickers and the numbers involved. 
We hire 
approximately 40 —80 hand 
pickers a day 
and they come form many 
locations in the county. 
Also the mechanical nature of picking 
is not represented. 
This process occurs at the end of the season 
and machines are used to strip the bushes 
of their remaining 
fruit. 
This step was accelerated in the late 60's and early 70's 
when labor shortage and minimum wage payments were being infor 
ced. 
It was during this period that our farm was electrified and 
we bought a large sorting machine and individual harvesting 
machines. 
Up to that point most of the sorting was done with 
wire screens with berries that were hand knocked a much older 
process. 
The co—operative that we send our berries to 
is also an 
important 
aspect of the business. 
This was started by members of my 
grandmother Thompson's generation 
with the help of Elizabeth 
White. 
Most of the old growers in the co—operative are 
relatives of the early members and continue in the tradition of 
marketing collectively. 
1-8. 
Team of two kids picking. 
One picks one side of the bush 
and one the other. 
The kids are from the local school 
in 
Chatsworth. 
The kids are picked up 
in the morning and ride 
in 
the back of the pickup and are returned in the early afternoon. 
An average of 20 to 40 students come each morning and represent 
about 30% of our pickers. 
The girl 
in the striped shirt is 
picking with both hands and 
dropping the berries in a can that 
McDonald--84 Color photo logs 
page 15 
is tied around her waist. 
9-11. 
Cluster of a Weymouth variety, an older cultivar that is 
the earliest berry to ripen. 
12-13. 
Cedar trays with added pine rails. 
The trays were 
purchased through the co—operative and the rails were made at a 
hardware store in Vincentown (Halls). 
The trays were made at a 
local sawmill and sold to growers. 
The rails are designed to 
increase the height between each flat or tray 
in order to not 
damage the berries on the bottom when stacking on the truck. 
The 
trays are filled with pint cups made of paper pulp that are also 
purchased from the co—operative. 
The picker fills the trays 
themselves and usually picks two at a time then turn them in 
to 
the person at the truck that is waiting to haul 
in any full ones. 
14-15 
Close up shot of the berries in the tray. 
The light 
colored berry that stands out is one that is not quiet ripe. 
It 
will probably be picked out by the packer on turned over so 
its 
ripest side is displayed to the consumer. 
The pickers are 
instructed to not pick green ones or one not quite ripe. 
Therefore there are people in the Thompson family walking through 
the field supervising the operation. 
16-19. 
A brother and sister partner picking. 
Brad Thompson 
picks these two up 
in the morning on my way through Chatsworth. 
In the back ground another team is working the other way and will 
soon finish the row.

1-3. 
Bending on one knee is one technique which saves stress on 
the back and 
is demonstrated in this series. 
4-5. 
Brad Thompson is giving a ticket to a picker who has 
finished a flat. 
This transaction usually occurs at the truck 
which is at the end of the row on the dirt road. 
The ticket is 
one half inch by by two and has printed on one side, S Thompson, 
twelve pints. 
It 
is 
red and 
is turned in at the end of the day 
for cash. 
A usual trick 
is 
to see how far the pickers can get 
me to come into the field 
in order to save them a few steps. 
My 
trick of course is to see 
if I can get them to carry the tray to 
the tailgate of the truck. 
Generally I only help older people 
who have a hard time moving which of course brings us to another 
trick. 
6-8. 
Debbie Miller joins the team to help them finish the row. 
Most of the pickers have moved to another field and Thompsons are 
trying to finish this field and move all 
the remaining pickers to 
the next area at the same time. 
Debbie Miller is also a student 
of Brad Thompson's brothers at the local school. 
9-10 
Picker walking tray to the truck to receive ticket. 
This 
picker is a student at Trenton State and will finish in a year or 
so. 
She comes and picks with her family and 
is from Willingboro 
a Levitt—planned development near the Delaware just across from 
Levittown, PA. 
11-13. 
Waiting at the end of the row to pick up flats. 
Brad 
hollers each time he stops the truck, "any full ones" and this 
will prompt people to start carrying in the trays. 
Some days it 
is hard to get people to respond. 
They may be hurrying to pick a 
certain number by a certain time and are reluctant to stop and 
bring them down. 
When picking the Weymouth things are usually 
McDonald--84 Color photo logs 
page 17 
slow. 
This particular variety does not crop as well 
as more 
recent varieties and pickers can not pick as many as they do 
later in the season. 
14-20. 
Unloading the truck and puting full flats on carts to be 
rolled into the packing house and packed. 
Slide 18 shows the 
"hock" which was discovered several years ago when a hoe was used 
to slide the berries off the truck. 
The blade of the hoe broke 
and the curved end remained. 
This device saves one from climbing 
on and off the truck. 
All unloading can be done from the ground. 
Before the hock and the increase in production, Brad remembers 
that as a small child his job was to push or carry the trays from 
the back of the truck to the front so his brother could unload 
them.

Continuation of unloading the truck. 
The wrapped brown tan 
package is a box of pints which will be delivered to the truck. 
Part of the routine 
is to pickup flats and drop off supplies. 
The long narrow green strip that runs parallel to the sand road 
is a drainage ditch that helps regulate the water table. 
6-7 
Views of the packing house from north. 
The original 
section or two story structure was built by my father with the 
help of Juber Stephenson in the early forties. 
The packing house 
is made of cedar clapboards and probably came form my grandfather 
Thompson's saw mill. 
Barley noticeable under the porch roof are 
windows that can be covered by by cedar awnings. 
The awnings 
retrack and cover opening and are typical of most packing houses 
in 
the area. 
The "A" frame timbers are reinforcements and a 
modern garage door replaces the somewhat larger original. 
8 View of the packing house form the east showing "L" shaped 
porch, benches and picnic table. 
This area is reserved for the 
pickers and acts as a lunch room. 
9-15 
Unloading truck with the assistance of Peter Boden who has 
been our shed boy for three years. 
He too 
is a student from the 
local school and follows his three older brothers as shed boy. 
This 
is a very prestigious position to hold and 
is reserved for 
the best works and pickers. 
The responsibilities are numerous. 
He tends to the packers, helps unload the truck, fills jugs of 
water and takes them to the pickers, at time picks up flats at 
the end of the row and does all that my mother, brother or my 
self ask him to do. He 
is fourteen and can drive the truck. 
This 
of course is the envy of his contemporaries and one perk of the 
job that is most sought. 
16-19 
Peter loads the 
truck with empty trays that I will take 
McDonald--84 Color photo logs 
page 13 
and unload 
in the field. 
Peter prefers to 
load them in piles and 
I would rather have them lower so they would be jerked off the 
truck. 
I usually win.

Bluecrop a variety that crops well and 
is highly favored by 
consumers. 
This variety is 
ripening as we pick the Weymouth and 
generally motivates the pickers to finish the earlier varieties 
so they can begin picking the Bluecrop. 
This shot was taken at 
our other farm in Retreat which is about three to four days ahead 
of Chatsworth in the ripening cycle.

Beverly Allen Adams and Chad Adams packing. 
Beverly Adams 
is also a local school teacher in Chatsworth who has been working

Chad Adams packing. 
He 
is demonstrating the begining to 
end cycle of packing one pint. 
First the pint is removed from 
the field tray and topped. 
Topping is the step that assures that 
there are not green berries, 
leaves of rotten berries and that 
the pint is fully rounded. 
In slide two you can see Chad's 
right index finger and thumb act as pincers to remove an unwanted 
berry. 
Next Chad has reached and gotten a piece of cellophane and 
centered the sheet on the pint. 
Then the packing frame is place 
over the sheet and moved over the berries wrapping the corners 
around the pint. 
A rubber band is stretched over the pint and 
hold the cellophane on the pint. 
Finally Chad put the packed pint 
in 
the cardboard box. 
The 
process is continued until twelve 
pints are packed and the flat is placed on a cart and the cycle 
begins again. 
Chad 
is paid 22 cents for each flat he packs. 
Usually he can pack between 16 —20 flats in an hour. 
8-10 
Chad Adams and his mother Beverly packing. 
The boxes that 
line the porch are used for mechanical picking and are stored 
under the porch until they are needed.

View of the packing house form the west. 
this view shows 
the wooden awnings that are opened 
and closed each day. 
This 
typical design of packing houses are being replaced by concrete 
block building which lack the cooling nature of cedar. 
With 
awnings porches and double story the packing house remains 
remarkably cool even 
in the hottest weather. 
Also the concrete 
floor retains coolness that it slowly disseminates during the day. 
13-19 
Series of the unloading and loading 
process from inside 
of the packing house. 
The cart is 
loaded and taken to the side 
of a packer who will take one flat at a time and pack. 
The 
packed flat will be placed on a similar cart thus limiting the 
times one has to pick up each flat.

Finished products as they looked stacked on the cart. 
Each 
cart will be stacked with forty flats making the tally at the 
end of the day easy and accurate. 
Each box 
is stamped with the 
growers number and size. 
Our number is 46 and the size 
is moon. 
That determination is made by counting how may berries there are 
in a cup. 
Moon is a small berry and 
counts from 90 berries to 
the cup on up. 
Crown is the larger berry and counts from 90 on 
down. 
3-5 
Flat as 
it appeared in the field. 
At the end of the day all 
berries are turned into the truck reguardless if they are filled. 
A ticket or combination of tickets is given to the picker. 
In 
this case the picker probably received tickets for ten pints. 
That would be two five pint tickets. 
The old flat tickets are 
in 
denominations of five pint tickets and one pint tickets there in 
allowing for payment of any number between 1 and 11 pints. The 
cans are turned in and people are paid under the porch by my 
mother.
