Fieldnotes 
Pre-Interview 
I left for Rick’s place around 9 in the morning, after first picking up my equipment from the museum 
around 830: I always make a point to double check / walkthrough my gear bag before I leave, to make 
sure I don’t forget anything or leave anything behind. I was scheduled to interview Rick in person in 
Rochester around 1030, which is about an hour and a half drive. Getting to Rochester from WNY – 
specifically Niagara County - you have a few options: Route 104, Route 18, or the 90 (thruway). I decided 
to take the thruway this time, as wouldn’t have to worry about traffic at the time.   
I got to Rick’s house right on time around 1030am, and gave him a text to let him know I was outside, 
then came up to the door and he let me in. We setup in his living room for the interview, after trying to 
figure out where a good place to do the interview would be. Rick’s got a few pets (dogs + cats), and this 
was my first interview since having my allergy tests confirmed / completed: which found that I’m allergic 
to pretty much every animal, trees, pollen, etc. (despite always having and currently having a dog.) The 
daily medication I’m on helps – but only to a point, so I kind of keep that in the back of my mind, hoping 
that the masks should also help a bit too. I’m scheduled to start immunotherapy / allergy shots later in 
the year, so that should provide a stronger / more long term solution.  
After walking through the structure for the interview, just checked with Rick if there were any other 
occupations connected to the speedway I wasn’t aware of (I knew he was a Track Announcer, but wasn’t 
sure if he worked in another position or not beforehand), which there wasn’t, and then jumped right in.  
Interview 
During the interview, Rick recalled his first exposure to dirt track racing and the dirt track world through 
following his uncle, who was a driver, and watching him race at local tracks (including the Perry 
Speedway). Before moving to Rochester, Rick lived in Batavia and Buffalo for a number of years, and had 
his first ‘experience’ as an announcer, doing PA announcing while in High School for the high school 
sports team. Then Rick talked about how he got his very first start in working within the realm of dirt 
tracks, getting in touch with the newspaper in Batavia (then Batavia Daily News) and covering local races 
for them. For Rick he mentioned this was kind of getting into the world of working in dirt track racing 
almost through the backdoor, in that he always loved racing and everything about it and getting in touch 
with the newspaper / covering dirt tracks for it gave him the ability to go to more tracks (with press 
pass) and to kind of get a little bit of a new perspective on it.  
 
In the interview Rick talked about his first experience behind the microphone in 1982, at the Perry 
Speedway during a major dirt series: which he joked about was kind of like stepping in for the first time 
and as a race fan, all these major / incredible racers being the ones you’re calling for the first time. Rick 
shared over the years how his experience being a track announcer developed and became more regular, 
including when he first started to fill in at the Ransomville speedway in 1990, and a radio show he did on 
WBEN in the late 80s, for local motorsport news. Although he does track announcing at other tracks as 
well every now and again (more regularly in the past), since moving to Rochester he’s been more fully 
focused (since 2000) at the Ransomville Speedway, as the track is closer than some of the other Buffalo 
area tracks he used to announce for. At Ransomville, Rick co announces with Dave Buchanan, who he 
jokes has known since he was a teenager and basically saw him grow up at the track: again touching on 
the deep community connections within local dirt tracks.  
One of the biggest takeaways I had from the interview which was really eye opening, was Rick sharing 
that there was an “art to being excited”, which was one of the main skills you develop as an announcer. 
In other words, that as an announcer, you need to keep the fans engaged and interested, but also being 
able to deliver clear messages. He also talked about some of the other dirt track announcers he learned 
a lot from, and talked a bit about developing / settling into a style, and the interplay of co-announcing 
dynamics work, and some of the announcers (other than Dave) he’s co-announced with over the years. 
Rick shared that one of the major responsibilities and what he always does, is taking copious amounts of 
notes, talking to drivers, and constantly doing research and being up to date with any changes every 
week – including in the offseason.  
Rick shared that one of the really challenging things to call is when there’s a wreck, and trying to balance 
and maintain calm for the fans: especially as things are being assessed (i.e. what kind of emergency 
response is needed), and knowing that someone’s family members might be in the stands watching as 
well. He also shared a funny story (as no one got hurt), of how one car in a heat had ended up somehow 
sliding over into the woods off the track, and no one really realized it until the cars came around again 
(usually wrecks are recognized right away) as the driver was not in the main pack, and everyone was 
thinking…hold on there’s a car missing. 
As the interview wrapped up and Rick shared some words of advice for those looking to get into 
announcing and shared some more thoughts on announcing, and his journey through it. After thanking 
Rick for the interview, I hit the stop button and ended the recording.   
Post Interview 
After the interview, Rick and I shared small talk for a little bit, talking about some announcers that we 
both knew over the years. I brought up Doc Emrick – one of the announcers I heard a lot being a NJ 
Devils fan in the early 00s – as something about the way that Rick was describing announcing, and 
having that expansive knowledge and preparation (and balancing with excitement) reminded me of his 
style. And sure enough, Rick mentioned that Doc was one of the announcers he loves (outside of dirt 
track)!  
After packing up my gear and saying goodbye to Rick, I load back into my car and head off for my next 
meeting / stop in Rochester, with an artist / friend have not seen since they moved from the Buffalo 
area to Rochester a year or two ago.
