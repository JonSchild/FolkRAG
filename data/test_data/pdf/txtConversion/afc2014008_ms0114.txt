History of the Southern California Academy
 
of  Sciences
 
On November 6, 1891, at the Hotel Lindley in Los
 
Angeles, a small group of men and women interested
 
in science formed the Southern California Science
 
Association.
 The name was changed to the present
 
one in 1896, meeting for the first time under
 
this title at the annual meeting of May 12,  1896.
 
It was not until May 11,  1907, that the Academy
 
was incorporated under state statutes.
 
The first periodical publication of the Academy
 
was known as the Proceedings of the Southern
 
California Academy of Sciences.
 The Bulletin of
 
the Southern California Academy of Sciences first
 
appeared in January,  1902, and has continued
 
regularly to date.
 In 1938 a monograph series
 
was begun - Memoirs of the Southern California
 
Academy of Sciences.
 Memoirs have appeared
 
irregularly as manuscripts have been forthcoming
 
and approved by the Board of Directors.
 
Officers and members of the Board of Directors
 
are listed on the inside front cover of the
 
Program.
 The president, elected by the Board of
 
Directors, may serve two terms of two years each.
 
The members of the board serve three year terms
 
of office and are elected by the membership.
 
A major change in philosophy has taken place
 
within the Academy during the past three years.
 
In an effort to promote growth and involvement in
 
environmental problems of Southern California the
 
Academy is seeking to bring together organizations,
 
both scientific and sociological,  so that mutual
 
interests may be served.
 It is important for
 
the success of this effort for the participating
 
organizations to maintain their individual
 
identities and for the Academy to promote
 
discourse among these groups.
 The annual
 
meeting held this year is the first project in
 
this direction.

 The Effects of Lowered Dissolved
  
Oxygen Concentrations on the Free Amino Acid Pool
 
of the Polychaetous Annelid Neanthes
  
arenaceodentata
 
The effects of varying dissolved oxygen concentrations
 
on the free amino acid pool of Neanthes arenaceodentata  
were studied.
 Twenty - three ninhydrin positive spots,
 
representing 32 alpha - amino nitrogen compounds, were
 
detected in the controls by use of two dimensional
 
descending chromatography.
 It was found that several
 
amino acids, notably proline,  tyrosine,  alanine,
 
aspartic acid,  and others to a lesser degree,  change
 
in relative proportions in response to the stress of
 
lowered dissolved oxygen.
 Possible explanations for
 
the observed changes in relative proportions of these
 
amino acids were offered.

 Converqent Morpholoqy of Chione
  
Californiensis and Chione Undatella
  
Specimens of the Recent_venerid bivalve genus Chione
  
were collected from two localities in Newport Beach,
 
California.
 Many individuals seemed to morphologically
 
transitional between Chione californiensis (Broderip,
 
1835)  and Chione undatella (
Sowerby, 1835).
 To
 
resolve the problem of identification,  measurements of
 
the height,  length and concentric rib spacing were made
 
because these are the criteria used to distinguish
 
the two species in the literature  (Keen and others).
 
These data suggest that the above criteria are not
 
sufficient for distinguishing C.  californiensis from
 
C. undatella morpholigally and that the two species
 
are conspecific.

The Reconstruction of E1
 
Pueblo De Los Anqeles: 
Fact or Fiction? 
Since the early 1920's, many people have attempted
 
to restore both structures and the illusive spirit
 
of early Los Angeles.
 The initial efforts, con -
tinuing to this day, have evolved into Olvera St.
 
Since 1946 the City and County of Los Angeles and
 
the State of California have attempted to restore
 
and otherwise provide for both recreational and
 
cultural activities in the Pico -Garnier block.
 
The recent opposition of historians and the
 
interested public has managed to block a proposed
 
contract which provided for no educational
 
facilities.
 Offered here is a proposed solution
 
to an effective combination of both commercial
 
and educational facilities.

 Conversion
  
of Araqonite to Calcite in the Pulmonate Gastropod
 
Cerion
  
Distribution of aragonite and calcite was deter-
mined in Recent and Late Pleistocene specimens of
 
the pulmonate gastropod, Cerion sp., from the
 
Bahamas.
 
X-ray diffraction analyses show that two Recent
 
pulmonate gastropod shells are entirely aragonite.
 
Calcite in two Pleistocene specimens is distri -
buted throughout the shell in a decreasing weight
 
percentage from the apex to the aperture and
 
then increases at the reflected lip.
 
This variation suggests that different portions
 
of the same specimen undergo several solution -
deposition conversions which are time dependent
 
on the extent of diagenesis in the sediments
 
before conversion occurs.

 Obsidian Hydration
 
Dating of Obsidian Buttes, Imperial County,
 
California
  
Indians have expoited obsidian from Obsidian Buttes
 
since it was exposed by the desiccation of Lake
 
Cahuilla.
 Obsidian hydration readings on artifacts
 
from local Indian middens, therefore, are bracketed
 
in the period from initial exploitation at dessica-
tion to disruption of aboriginal culture.
 Indian
 
traditions and Hubb's radiocarbon dates fix the
 
first about 1600 A.D., while the latter is about
 
1850 A.D.
 Projected from these dates, it is
 
proposed that the primary hydration readings on
 
Obsidian Buttes indicate it was formed about
 
1,000 A.D.

Methods for Estimating Populations of Soil -borne
  
Microflora
  
Repres-ntative counts of soil -borne fungi and
 
bacteria are particularly important in ecological
 
studies and in predicting the incidence of plant
 
or animal disease.
 Yet methods and media used to
 
measure populations of soil -borne microorganisms
 
usually detect only part of the total, viable thalli
 
or propaguels present.
 This research indicates
 
that our capacity for quantitatively estimating
 
the size of actual populations can be improved by
 
selectively treating (temperature, moisture,
 
chemicals)  soil samples prior to standard dilution-
plating procedures.
 Quantitation of Fusarium spp.
 
is emphasized;
 however, other interacting fungi
 
and bacteria are discussed.

The Effect of Dissolved Oxygen
  
Concentration on Enzyme Activity
  
The presence and activity of MDH (both cytosol and
 
mitochondrial) and LDH was determined for the poly -
chaetous annelid, Neanthes arenaceodentata. 
The
 
enzyme activity for the two enzymes was as follows:
 
MDH (cytosol) = 7
.05, MDH (mitochondrial) = 0.58
 
and LDH = 1
.85.
 Units of activity were expressed as
 
micronoles of NADH oxidized per minute per milli -
gram of protein.
 The activity of MDH was higher
 
than LDH indicating that in this invertebrate the
 
end product of anaerobic glycolysis is succinate.
 
Decreased oxygen concentrations caused marked
 
changes in all enzyme activities.
 These changes
 
could be explained by variations in body protein
 
concentration and actual enzyme activity changes.
 
In all cases at a 3
.3 mg/L D.O.  a drop in body
 
protein occurred.
 Subsequently lowered oxygen
 
levels caused an increase in body protein level to
 
about the normal control concentration.

 Science Reporting in
 
American Newspapers
  
A survey of 8 newspapers was made to ascertain how much
 
science news in proportion to other news is reported.
 
Out of almost 16,000 newspaper stories surveyed, only 3
.3
 
percent were devoted to science.
 In addition, a content
 
analysis of the science articles was made with special
 
emphasis on the type and quality of Anthropology news
 
reported.
 Almost one -half of the articles concerned the
 
social and natural sciences, and only 9 percent of the
 
articles were devoted to physical science news.
 Medicine
 
received about twice that amount of coverage while aero -
space news was less than 4 percent of all science news
 
reported.
 The quality of all science reporting was quite
 
high with the sole exception of Anthropology news since
 
in those case$,  science writes rarely consulted with an
 
anthropologist.
 Thus scientists in general must work for
 
increased news coverage and Anthropology needs to increase
 
the quality of its coverage.

Treasure House of Prehistoric Cave Art
 
Prehistoric art has long interested historians and
 
archaeologists alike.
 Its origins extend back more
 
than 30,000 years.
 In order to better understand
 
the significance of prehistoric art people have used
 
a variety of methods ranging from comparative
 
ethnography to computer analysis.
 The majority of
 
results have been litte more than educated guesses
 
and cannot be tested in archaeological situations.
 
However, one method has not yet been adequately
 
applied;
 that of correlating the activity of an
 
archaeological site with its accompanying art forms.
 
Ven 195 is located in the Santa Monica Mountains and
 
is accompanied by a variety of red pictographs.
 The
 
authors hope that excavation of Ven 195 would help
 
answer the question of what the function of picto-
graphs was in the primitive society of this region.
 
The authors found they associated with hunting
 
activity.

conducted around Santa Catalina Island, in connection
 
with the University of Southern California Marine
 
Laboratory there.
 The goals of that initial survey
 
have been essentially accomplished, and emphasis has
 
switched to a more detailed study of a particular
 
area.
 A permanently marked transect, about one mile
 
long, is being established in the Isthmus area;
 and
 
studies will be conducted along its length on a
 
seasonal basis in depths ranging from high intertidal
 
to 200 meters.
 Methods will be developed and tested
 
for standardizing marine biological survey techniques,
 
including the use of closed circuit television.
 The
 
transect will also provide an area for training in
 
underwater survey methods, and will have established
 
stations for physiological experimentation in

atomic alsorption techniques.
 Mg concentrations
 
in the umbonal areas were consistently greater
 
than those along the margins.  Sr concentration
 
remained uniform throughout the shell.
 Maximum
 
concentrations were 353 + 21 ppm for Mg and
 
2690 + 300 ppm for Sr.
 Minimum concentrations

 Voluntary Control of Sinqle Brain
  
Cells durinq Paralysis
  
Rats were chronically implanted with microelectrodes
 
for recording from single brain cells and with stimu-
lating electrodes in rewarding areas.
 After surgery
 
they were trained to make overt responses for rewarding
 
brain shock only during a period signalled by a light.
 
The reward was then made contingent upon responses made
 
by single cells in the brain.
 Finally they were para-
lized and tested for maintenance of the conditioned
 
brain response.
 The results show that there is
 
characteristically poor or non -existent voluntary
 
control in some brain areas while there is character -
istically good voluntary control in others despite
 
the lack of feedback from overt movement.

allowed to regrow to chaparral while other regions for
 
comparative water studies were maintained as grassland.
 
Grassy areas are not normally large in Southern
 
California chaparral regions;
 the granivorous rodents
 
(most notably Dipodomys agilis) normally a minor

 Prehibernatory Fatteninq
  
in the Beldinq Ground Squirrel
  
Body weight and total body lipids were measured
 
in Spermophilus beldinqi beldinqi residing at
 
2
,134 m and 3,048 m in the Sierra Nevada.
 Lipid
 
levels were low during midsummer and then began
 
to increase.
 By the time squirrels entered
 
hibernation their body lipids comprised 20 to 30%
 
of total body weight.
 Within the population
 
most of this fat was deposited during the last
 
six weeks above ground, however, weight records
 
of constantly retrapped individuals showed that
 
the fattening response occurred within two to
 
three weeks.
 The abrupt inception and rate of
 
lipid deposition suggests that it is timed and
 
involves a marked increase in appetite.

 The vaccine

 Within one week after the final
 
injection, the rabbit is exsanguinated by cardiac
 
puncture.
 The blood is

serum, which is then used as a vaccine against the
 
tumor.
 
This serum was successful in preventing tumor growth
 
in 2/3 of the mice tested.
 However,  since only a
 
small number of animals was used, further testing is
 
necessary before a definite conclusion can be made.

The Masking Response to Surge,
 
Sunlight and Ultraviolet Light in Lytechinus
  
Anamesus
 
Examination of the masking reaction (covering
 
with shells) by Lithechinus anamesus in response
 
to ultraviolet irradiation,  sunlight and surge
 
suggests that previous hypotheses are inadequate.
 
Shaded L. anamesus initially reacts to short
 
wave length U.V. with a strong masking response
 
which is followed by death after several days'
 
exposure.
 Long wave U.V.  elicits moderate
 
masking, while the non -irradiated controls
 
rarely masked.
 These responses to U.V.  light
 
are probably artifacts as L.  anamesus and other
 
sea urchins  are seldom exposed to that factor
 
in nature.
 There is a strong and immediate
 
response to direct sunlight.
 
Application of surge induces a response equal to
 
that of sunlight, regardless of the light
 
conditions.
 The intensity of masking during
 
periods of surge appears to increase during the
 
exposure period.
 Cessation of surge results in
 
a rapid reduction in masking and a marked
 
increase in movement.
 We suggest that masking
 
is important in increasing the stability of the
 
sea urchin during periods of increased surge by
 
effectively increasing their density, reducing
 
effective surface area and changing the
 
configuration they present to surge forces.

The Interaction Between Sharks and
 
Dolphins
  
There are many similarities between dolphins and sharks,
 
On the surface, both are highly streamlined and shaped
 
for an active existence.
 Each group is far ranging,
 
being present in practically all oceanic and some fresh
 
water environments.
 Both are active predators,
 
depending on speed and maneuverability for their
 
existence.
 
With these and other similarities there is bound to be
 
contact between these two groups.
 There are
 
differences, however.
 A shark will eat meat, which
 
poses a threat to the dolphin.
 But is this as far as
 
the interaction goes?
 Why will dolphins live in a
 
tank peacefully with a shark and then suddenly kill
 
it,  as has happened in many aquariums?
 Was it that
 
the dolphin had suddenly tired of the outsider, or
 
does this indicate something deeper?
 
In the wild,  sharks will not stay in the immediate area
 
with dolphins, but still are never far away.
 Paths
 
must cross and it is these crossings which I intend

 Aqqreqation and Dispersal
  
Behavior in Captive Gopherus Aqassizi
  
In captive herds of the desert tortoise, Gopherus
 
aqassizi, the population disperses due to a
 
reaction to fecal pellets placed in sleeping
 
areas by dominant male tortoises.
 In the winter
 
when digestion is slowed, fewer fecal pellets are
 
formed and the dominant males are the last to
 
enter the hibernacula so aggregation can occur.
 
Conspecific urine of Gopherus aqassizi does not
 
elicit dispersal but Gopherus berlandieri urine
 
does elicit Gopherus aqassizi dispersal.

The Role of the Tail in
 
Coition in the Desert Tortoise
o
 pherus Aqassizi)
 
The male desert tortoise, Gopherus aqassizi, uses
 
tail as an aid in assuming cloacal contact and as
 
an aid in maintenance of coital posture which
 
appears to be a behavioral correlate to the tail
 
hook of the travancore tortoise, Geochelone
  
travancorica.

 Preliminary Studies of the Plant-
Animal Community on Bird Rock, Santa Catalina Island
  
A permanent transect for marine studies has recently
 
been established near the University of Southern
 
California Marine Laboratory at Santa Catalina
 
Island.
 Although the transect is largely subtidal,
 
it does bisect the small, dense plant community
 
supported by the shallow soil on top of Bird Rock,
 
an isolated rocky island in the Isthmus area.
 Thorne
 
(1967) included Bird Rock in his study of the Catalina
 
flora, but little or no information is available on
 
the seasonality of the few plants that comprise the
 
community, or their response to the abundance of
 
birds and absence of the grazing vertebrates which
 
inhabit the main Island mass.
 The biology of this
 
plant community will be studied as part of the marine
 
transect, to define the total biota of the community,
 
as well as noting seasonal changes.

 Archaeology, Epistemoloqy,
 
Methodology
  
A growing number of archaeologists are beginning to
 
examine the epistemological and methodological
 
foundations of their field.
 There is a tacit agree -
ment among these concerned scientists that archaeology
 
should now make a contribution to the knowledge of
 
social science  by formulating valid laws of human
 
behavior which hold for all places and for all historic
 
and prehistoric times of cultural occupation.
 
This paper focuses on these topics defining archaeology
 
as an epistemological or probability -based science
 
which deals with past human behavior.
 In this context,
 
the kinds of laws that archaeologists may hope to
 
purpose are discussed.
 In addition, certain aspects
 
of methodology are presented which deal with the use
 
of theory in the quest for the relationships between
 
phenomena to which valid statements called laws may be
 
applied.
 These aspects include:
 the usefulness of
 
inductive and deductive approaches to archaeological
 
research, the relationship of data to theory, and the
 
organization of data into conceptual frameworks the
 
sciences call models.

Vision in Dipsosaurus dorsalis
  
Eight out of19 desert iguanas completing trials were
 
trained to move toward one of two monochromatic light
 
sources (red, blue, or green) at the ends of a Y-maze.
 
Lizards that moved toward the positive color were
 
rewarded with heat and/or food.
 The positive color
 
for each lizard remained the same throughout the
 
trials.
 Seven lizards were trained to red;
 one, to
 
green;
 none, to blue.
 Fifteen to 120 trials
 
(ave.  78) were required before lizards clearly exhi -
bited learning.
 No appreciable change in latency

 Physioloqical Variation in
 
Field Populations of Neotoma Lepida in the
 
Colorado Desert
  
Patterns of body water flux and plasmation
 
regulation were obtained for two for two feral
 
populations of Neotoma lepida. 
The total
 
sample size was 39 individuals.
 The following
 
results were obtained:
 
(1) Populations of the same species exhibited
 
physiological variation;
 
(7
_) The frequency of pelage coloration varied
 
between the two populations
 
e3) No physiological differences were found
 
between the two morphological groups, and
 
&
4) No transmigration of marked individuals
 
between the two populations was noted.
 
The significance of these results in speciation
 
is discussed.

completely.
 Scientists could not convert their

and could not agree among themselves on the
 
feasibility or even desirability of stopping
 
smoke.
 Legislators attempting to deal with

 Ecoloqical Notes on Two Species
  
of Froq Chiqqers (Genus Hannemania) in Joshua Tree
 
National Monument
  
Two species of Hannemania occur in Jushua Tree National
 
Monument.
 Hannemania hylae is found on the California
 
Tree Frog Hyla cadaverina and Hannemania bufonis infests
 
the Red Spotted Toad Bufo punctatus. Hyla cadaverina
  
with H. hylae are found at two localities in Joshua
 
Tree National Monument whereas Bufo punctatus with
 
H. bufonis are found at these and other localities.
 
A single study area was selected where both hosts and
 
their chiggers occur.
 The study was conducted from May,
 
1969 to April,  1971, and on each visit these amphibians
 
were caught and released after the toes were clipped
 
and the chiggers counted.
 Using these data estimates
 
of each kind of chigger and their host populations
 
were made for each season.
 Attemps were also made to
 
locate the free -living stage including the predaceous
 
nymphs and adult.

 Soil
 
samples from nearby barren areas served as controls.
 
Chamise soil contained the smallest number of bacteria.
 
Manzanita soil contained twice as many and Scrub Oak
 
soil six times as many bacteria as Chamise soil.
 
Control samples contained 60 times as many bacteria as
 
Chamise soil.
 Water-soluble materials extracted
 
from the plants were used in inhibition tests against
 
the bacteria.
 All extracts demonstrated inhibitive
 
effects.
 Chamise extracts demonstrated the most and
 
Scrub Oak the least inhibition against the nitrite-
and nitrate -producing soil bacteria.

An Open Letter from the Southern California Academy of Sciences
 
As the New Year begins and Southern California is experiencing its own
 
natural beauty on those occasional relatively pollution-free days that
 
are a part of this Season's weather, it seems an appropriate time to
 
bring the Southern California Academy of Sciences to the attention of
 
the Southern California community.  Traditionally this Academy has
 
been concerned with encouragement and promotion of s
tudent interest
 
in s
cience and with providing a publishing outlet for professional
 
papers, primarily in the Natural Sciences.  Our annual meetings
 
provide an opportunity for students and established scientists to
 
get together on both a professional and an informal basis, and our
 
program of periodic lectures, free and open to the public, present
 
topics of more general interest to a wider audience.
 
During this past year we have started moving in a new direction,
 
toward a broader membership base and more involvement in current
 
problems where our position as a professional s
cientific society
 
may be of some use.  In the coming year we will endeavor to continue
 
in this direction.  For instance, our membership now includes s
cien-
tists who are competent in various fields relating to current problems
 
of environmental pollution and management, and we hope to bring to-
gether a register of those who may be contacted for answers to questions
 
in specific areas of concern.  The prospect of an increased and in-
terested membership and the hope of effecting closer relationships
 
among the areas of Science and between the s
cientific and non-scientific
 
elements of the Southern California community are what we look forward
 
to as means of becoming more effective as a regional Academy of
 
Sciences in 1971.

Snakes and Their Tales
  
Snake stories may have started with Adam and Eve, but also occur in a variety of
 
other ethnic and cultural contexts.
 Snakes are usually given the underdog,
 
sinful,  devil role and are thus maligned (
'Original Sin'), or chased out
 
(St.  Patrick)  or beaten  (B.C. Comics).
 Many positive folklore roles of snakes
 
include healing  (Japanese Viper wines), fertility  (Taiwan, Africa)  and as source
 
of all life  (Australian Aborigines).
 But modern medicine and the space age are
 
not without their snake tales too!

Folklore and Bankinq
  
Can folklore be found in banking?
 It would not seem so, but quite a lot can be
 
found.
 The people often say and do things they don't realize as folklore.
 The
 
items range from sayings about the number of customers on Monday can tell you
 
how may will be there during the week to stories of inspections and funny happenings.
 
Often what is said is quite accurate  (or at least it seems that way).

 The purpose of
 
this research was to determine the number of species of Leptophlebioidea which
 
occur in this geographical region,  to describe any new species,  and to study the
 
biogeography of all species.

Food Habits of Rana Muscosa (
Anura: Ranidae)
 
Thirty -eight specimens of Rana muscosa, ranging from 37 to 70 mm snout-vent length,
 
were collected from seven southern California localities.
 The 215 items found
 
in the stomachs consisted of 88.1% inselfs (
11 orders), 6
.1% arachnids,  0
.5%
 
chilopods, and 5
.6% miscellaneous items.
 The frogs were analyzed for effect of
 
body size, sex, and season on food habits.
 Rana muscosa is highly non-selective
 
in its food habits, ingesting any item of appropriate size moving within range.
 
Larger frogs contained more items than smaller frogs;  no significant sexual
 
dimorphism in food was found;
 seasonal variation in food reflects similar
 
variation in prey abundance.

Prelude to the Art of Tal
.e -Tellinq in the Azores: 
Gesture and Action 
The Azorian tale - tellers who are most respected are precisely those who have
 
mastered the use of gesture and action.
 Through gesture and action there is
 
communication behind the words influencing context and determining attitudes
 
towards verbal content,  and such results from a conscious effort to portray the
 
characters,  the action, meaning and drama of a story.
 Hence,  the tal eteller
 
recourses to a non -verbal artistic and dramatic means to captivate the audience
 
and to enhance the plausibility of the tale.
 An expansive bibliography is
 
developing on the subject of gestures as may be seen by R.S. Boggs, "Gestures:
 
A Working Bibliography."
 Scholars differ as to how gestures should be
 
classified.
 I propose here an approach to the study of gestures and action
 
specifically with respect to the Art of tale-telling.

 These charms provide a point of departure

 Much of the

The Concept of Completeness in Nineteenth Century Science
  
A minor but persistent attitude in the late Nineteenth Century was that all the
 
great scientific discoveries had been made, and everything worth knowing was
 
known.
 All that remained was to measure physical constants to another decimal
 
place.
 What was the extent of this view?
 What effect did it have upon
 
science?
 Was it conditioned by other facets of Nineteenth Century culture?

Personal Encounters with a Ship Spirit: 
A Survey of Memorates in the
 
Klabautermann Tradition
  
The Klabautermann is a ship spirit both loved and feared by sailing crews of the
 
Northern Seas.
 An inquiry into the circumstances of personal encounters with
 
the spirit reveals associational and perceptual patterns, which can be discerned
 
in stories not belonging to this genre.
 This similarity speaks strongly of
 
the influence exerted by Memorates on the development of the legend cycle.

Although popular historians often claim that the current American-Soviet domi-
nation in the field of rocketry grew from the Nazi rocket program at Peenemunde,
 
it should be added that the only reason these nations were able to use the
 
Peenemunde fallout is because they already possessed considerable experience
 
in rocketry at the time of the Nazi surrender.
 This experience stemmed
 
primarily from Allied rocket development projects during the War.
 Covered
 
in the presentation are:
 the origins of these projects in the 1930's;
 their
 
growth during the War;
 and a discussion of the teachnical problems they had

Sailors, Scientists, and Rockets
  
Indifference characterized the relationship between U.S.  scientists and
 
military officers before World War II.
 The military typically referred to
 
scientists as "Damn Professors" with impractical ideas.
 Scientists frequently
 
spoke of naval officers as "Deep Water Sailors" suspicious of new ideas and
 
regimented to an inflexible command system.
 
Outstanding examples of both failures and successes in military -scientific
 
collaboration are seen in the history of rocketry from World War I through
 
World War II.
 Examples are reviewed for their application to world dilemmas
 
whose solutions depend on establishing effective interfaces between groups
 
with divergent backgrounds.

The Honey -Guide in Fact and in African Leqend
  
Until the advent of the European the only source of sweets for the African
 
natives was wild bees' honey.
 They long ago learned to follow a bird, the
 
honey -guide, which sought out wild beehives, and as a result many tribes
 
developed legends about this avian symbiont, both as to how to take advantage
 
of it, and how to avoid its displeasure.

scientists as "Damn Professors" with impractical ideas.
 Scientists frequently
 
spoke of naval officers as "Deep Water Sailors" suspicious of new ideas and
 
regimented to an inflexible command system.
 
Cutstanding examples of both failures and successes in military -scientific
 
collaboration are seen in the history of rocketry from World War I through
 
Uorld War II.
 Examples are reviewed for their application to world dilemmas
 
whose solutions depend on establishing effective interfaces between groups
 
wjth divergent backgrounds.

The Honey-Guide in Fact and in African Leqend
  
Until the advent of the European the only source of sweets for the African
 
natives was wild bees' honey.
 They long ago learned to follow a bird, the
 
honey-guide, which sought out wild beehives, and as a result many tribes
 
developed legends about this avian symbiont, both as to how to take advantage
 
of it, and how to avoid its displeasure.

Socioloqy and Folklore in "Derry Gaol" 
Of three theoretical orientations to folklore -
 esthetic, etiological,
 
sociological -
 the latter appears to be in the ascendancy in American folklore
 
scholarship.
 This paper attempts to demonstrate through examination of a
 
single ballad tradition that the first two are indispensable to the formulation
 
of sound sociological conclusions.

Analytical Techniques for the Comparison of Ballad Tunes 
Many techni q
ues for the analysis of music have been devised by ethnomusicologists,
 
folklorists,  and anthropologists.
 Some of these techni q
ues can be applied
 
to the comparison of British and American ballad tunes.
 The computer will be
 
used to ensure that the comparison will be done objectively, consistently,  and
 
accurately.

Los Angeles, California
 
Dear Wayland:
 
v  
This i
s a most embarrassing l
etter to have to write, but the whole situation i
s
 
so embarrassing that I have decided t
o try to get i
t down on paper, if only to
 
c
lear r
ay own thinking.
 
I was, f
rankly, horrified to discover Monday that Mr. Akers had won a first place
 
award at the SCAS meeting, since you know and I know that his paper, though quite
 
acceptable undergraduate work, was folklorically naive and contained more amuse-
ment than neat.  Actually, I had only realized the day before the meeting that
 
there was a student contest involved -
- a
s you say, I sometimes don't read my
 
mail thoroughly.  And though the judge mentioned to me before I went home that
 
afternoon that Mr. Akers was up for an award, I certainly never dreamed that it
 
was for first place or f
or such a substantial sum of money.  At worst, I thou ht
 
he might get a certificate of^
.ierit or have his name read off at the banquet.
 
You note 1 say "at worst".  I should l
ike to go on record here and now a
s saying
 
that I have come to disapprove of student contests, root and branch, and I would
 
not have supported Mr. Akers' entry
,- i
n any way, had I known t
here was a prize
 
involved.  If we are supposed t
o be training future professionals, the reward f
or
 
effort should, I r
eel, be a really professional one! recognition by one's peers,
 
a stimulating discussion of one's i
deas and, a
t best, onAhs name in a prograrr
:.
 
To hol,  out "awards" i
s, to m
_; way of thinking ; kid s
tuff and inappropriate on
 
an academic l
evel, except in such massive sensAs as a %itre award or those honors
 
given by colleagues to a man who has reached a position of eminence in his dis-
cipline, or to a student whose cuss l
at
.i
.ve record i
s of hi h quality.
 
Awards for single papers on a student l
evel are always ultimately unfair and l
ead
 
to hostile feelings, instead of the good f
ellows'ai;) and stimulatin;; interactions
 
we hope to develop by holding meetin s
.  For one thin â€ž what i
s a student?  A young
 
person who, l
ike Mr. Akers, has had only a single semester's exposure to the com-
plex
, concepts involved in f
olklore?  I would say he i
s a student, but so i
s the
 
doctoral candidate who has already been teaching for some years, and so am f
, f
or
 
that matter.  A
ir. Akers "won", in my opinion, because he had the good f
ortune to
 
address himself to a topic of special interest to a great many people; but, f
rankly,
 
my heart bleeds f
or the student scholar who has been working f
or years on some
 
obscurer subject that not t
oo many people cared about or had the necessary exper-
tise to evaluate.
 
Furthermore, a
s a teacher, this kind of thing puts me in an impossible position.  If
 
Mr. Akers wants to present his preliminary study in public f
or criticism and comment,
 
i
t seems there seems to be some means f
or him to do so. And -- mess 1 think the
 
wor.c i
s disastrously bad -

tudent not to apply, when there

realize the problem of student papers has always been a thorny one; my general
 
feeling has been that s
tudents should be encouraged as a part of their education
 
to try themselves out, preferably (
though this i
s difficult f
or undergraduates
 
who often don't take a course in folklore until their senior year) after they
 
1
_ave attended a meeting themselves.  But undergraduate papers are, a
s they should
 
be, on a totally different level than those of trained graduate studnets; what i
s
 
a good sound first year research or collection would be quite unacceptable f
rom
 
a graduate s
tudent of s
cxne experience.  o
n the other hand, i
f undergraduate
 
papers are eliminated from all meetings, this i
tself l
imits s
tudent participation
 
entirely to UCLA and Zerkeley, and that seems an unsatisfactory solution from
 
every point of view.
 
I have no ready answer to the dilemma; but I d
o f
eel, with some intensity, that
 
tie d
ifficulties of presenting s
tudent papers are sufficient in and of L
h
 emselves
 
without further c
ompounding the problem by offering prizes f
or t
he "beat" work;
 
there just i
s no such thing.  And I shall not circulate next year's SCAS call
 
for student papers at Valley State as l
ong as there i
s any element of a contest
 
involved.  I d
o not want my students either to win or to l
ose; I want them Lo
 
learn s=ething.
 
Perhaps I could drop by your office some time next week and we could discuss this
 
a bit further.  One of t
he s
teps that has occurred t
o me i
s to poll the Board
 
informally a
sking them to consider wh
 e
t'her or not the California Folklore Society
 
might properly withdraw unilaterally f
rom the prize-giving a

SCASY  Personally, I would not be satisfied by our simply Insisting that a f
ully

this year's judge, a kindly and

Abstract
 
Germanic Treasure
 
The place and function of a treasure-hoard in literature
 
reflects a tradition considerably older than the texts
 
themselves, representing  an archaic belief of ancient
 
Germanic society,  surviving past the "Age of Migrations."
 
This paper examines manifestations of treasure in traditional
 
medieval Germanic literature, emphasizing the intrinsic
 
properties, location, and acquisition of treasure. Topics
 
treated include the functional contrast between gold and iron,
 
treasure as the tangible equivalent of wisdom, and the
 
association of the exiled man with acquisition of treasure.
 
Examples are drawn, inter alia, from Beowulf, the Nibelungen-
lied, the VRlsungasaga, the Fafnismal, and the Gesta Danorum.

Please do not give the Akers prize another thought.  That is
 
the way things work out this year, and everyone has accommodated him
 
or herself to the decision.
 
It was clearly understood in the letter of solicitation put
 
out by the Academy that student prizes would be awarded.  Only one
 
student that I know of here at UCLA made any special reference to
 
that fact in the course of preparing the paper.
 
It would be well another year, I think, to have a panel of
 
folklorists do the judging.  I
, myself, heard two or three papers,
 
as a minimum, and then missed one or two other student papers which
 
I should like to have heard.  I think that with a three-man panel
 
judging the contest, some assessment can be made of the relative
 
difficulty of the papers, how well the material was researched, and
 
how well it was actually presented at the meetings.
 
Having been brought up in a system where rewards are not
 
always properly measured out, either to students or to professional
 
workers, I am not as disturbed as you are about the aspects of the
 
r
rprize."  I would like to think that students would put the very
 
best they could into a paper, and would rejoice if they should happen
 
to win a prize as a sort of unforeseen bonus.
 
Perhaps I have oversimplified this, and perhaps there is a
 
greater problem than I see.  At any rate, I would be pleased to dis-
cuss this matter in person or over the phone.  Meanwhile, no one
 
begrudges Mr. Akers his good fortune.
 
I hope that things are going well with C.F.S. and I do not see
 
any reason why they should not be.  You will find that next year's meet-
ings will be upon us sooner than you expect.  If you can get the facts
 
about the next meeting (
time and place of meeting, and the committees)
 
into the October number of Western Folklore, you will have done a better
