 Mattison adjusts the action_

Mattison adjusting the action. There are 35 steps in 
the adjustment, times 88 keys. Each key has its own 
action. If you adjust one, you must adjust all of them. 
The “action” is the heart of the piano. Its purpose is to 
transmit the actions of the pianist to the hammers. The 
action mechanism consists of several parts. These 
parts are activated by the key, and work together to 
push the hammer toward the string.  Each key on the 
piano controls its own action mechanism. There are 
typically 88 on the modern grand piano.
