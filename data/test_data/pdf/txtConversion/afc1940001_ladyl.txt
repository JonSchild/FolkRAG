The Lady del RoyThe sun had just risen and shone o'er the plain;The birds they were singing,
all nature serene,I espied a young couple on Erin's green shoreA-viewing the ocean where the
wild billows roar.The one was a maiden, a maiden so fair,The other a soldier persuading his
dear,Persuading his darling to take a convoy,And sail round the ocean in the Lady del Roy[.?]"Oh
captain, oh captain, please stay for a while,"Thus spoke the fair maiden on Erin's green isle,"I'll
pledge to you truly my heart and my hand,With love like the ocean so deep and so grand." *When in
a lone vessel, he sailed on the main,And in a fierce battle with three vessels of Spain,Three vessels
he captured, three vessels so grand,And sailed them in triumph to fair Ireland. *And soon this
young couple from Erin's green shore,Were out on the ocean where wild billows roar,"Oh captain, oh
captain," the maiden did cry,"If some Spanish vessels once more you espy, *"Three ships will convoy
us, for now you are mine,"Then drew her so quietly, his arms round her twine,And then this young
captain, he made this reply,"For the sake of my lady, I fight till I die." *I've named these three vessels
all hailing from Spain;I've named these three vessels, I'll name them again.The one is Piazza, the
other, Del Roy,And the other one, the True Love that none can destroy.

Lady LeRoyBright Phoebus had arisen and shown shone o'er the sea,The song birds were humming,
all nature seemed gay,I spied a young couple, along Erin's shore,A-viewing the ocean where the wild
breakers roar.One was a young lady, exceedingly fair,The other a sea captain, persuading his dear,To
cross the wild ocean without a convoy,In a ship he commanded, called the Lady LeRoy."Oh Sally,
pretty Sally, you're the one I adore,And to go away and leave you would grieve my heart sore,Your
father is great and he's angry with me,And if I tarry with you, my ruin he'll be."Then Sally was sorry
and she hung down her head,But at last she took courage and unto him said,"If I consent to go with
you, we'll have a convoy,A fair ship shall accompany your Lady LeRoy."Then Sally dressed up in a suit
of men's clothes,And a way to her father, disguised she goes.She purchased a vessel, paid down on

demand,And little did he think 'twas from his own daughter's hand.Then away to her lover, away in
great haste,"Make ready, make ready, we've no time to waste."They hoisted their top sails, bright
colors let fly,And away o'er the ocean sailed the Lady LeRoy.Now when her old father came this to
understand,He swore a revenge on this worthy young man;He swore that his daughter would ne'er
be his wife,And for her disobedience he'd end her sweet life.Then away to his captain, away in great
haste,"Make ready, make ready, there's no time to waste."They hoisted their top sails, their colors let
fly,And away in pursuit of the Lady LeRoy. THE LADY DEL ROY
THE LADY DEL ROY as compiled by George Vinton Graham. I havewritten this old song taught to me
by ny Uncle Porter Graham; he wasa miner and pioneer in and around Sutter Fort when this song
was popular.
The sun had just risin' and shone on o'er the plain,The birds they were singing, all nature serene,I
espied a young couple on Erin's green shoreA-viewing the ocean where the wild billows roar.The one
was a maiden, a maiden so fair,The other a soldier, persuading his dear,Persuading his darling to
take a convoy,And sail round the ocean in the Lady del Roy.[["?]Oh captain, please stay for a while, "
Thus spoke the fair maiden on Erin's green isle,"I'll pledge to you truly my heart and my hand,With
love like the ocean so deep and so grand."?][When in a lone vessel, he sailed on the main,And in a
fierce battle with three vessels of Spain,Three vessels he captured, three vessels so grand,And sailed
them in triumph to fair Ireland.And soon this young couple from Erin's green shore,Were out on
the ocean where wild billows roar,"Oh captain, oh captain, "[the?] maiden did cry,"If some Spanish
vessels once more you espy.[?]"Three ships will convoy us, for now you are mine,"Than drew her so
quietly, his arms round her twine,And then this young captain, he made this reply,[ " For the sake
of my lady,I'll I fight till I die."?]"I won these three vessels all hailing from SpainI named these three
vessels, I'll name them again,The one is [ Pias?] [  Piazza? ?] he other del Roy,And the other one is
the true love that none can destroy." 2 2 of 2Lady LeRoyThey had not sailed more than a week or
ten days,When the winds from the south brought a right pleasant gaze;They saw a ship sailing that
caused then much joy,They hailed her and found 'twas the Lady LeRoy.He ordered them backward
to old Erin's shore,"Or a broadside of grape shot this moment I'll pour,"But Sally's young lover made
this reply,"For the sake of my Sally I'll conquer or die."Then broadside after broadside their cannons
did roar,And broadside after broadside the shot and shell poured,But Sally's young lover gained
the victory,And they sailed to a country of sweet liberty.These two noble vessels sailed far o'er the
main,Those two noble vessels I'll mention by name,The one was the Essex, the other LeRoy,Good
luck to fair Sally and her bold Irish boy! [ Warde Ford ?] [25E-B1?]Ben Ricesings [?][some song?][??]of
