I; 
MY MOTHER'S GRAVE. 
WORDS BY HARDY S. SARGENT. 
KUM 
BY E. A. WEDGWOOD. 
Just within the little church yard, 
'Neath the weeping wihow tree; 
Where the birdies sing in summer, 
Lies a 
form 'tis dear to me. 
Oft I 
think, when sad and lonely, 
Of this one whose gone before, 
Up above to dwell with angels, 
In the bright the evermore. 
CHORUg. 
When adrift upon life's ocean, 
Passing o'er each rippled wave, 
Oft my heart is filled with sadness, 
Thinking of my mother's grave. 
I 
remember in my childhood, 
When upon her dying bed, 
Of the counsel that she gave me, 
Then her gentle spirit fled. 
And long since, though years have flown. 
Yet my heart is filled with woe, 
When I 
think how 
have erred 
From the way she'd had me go. 
Chorus. 
• 
Though the years have gone forever, 
And I'll never see her more, 
Yet I 
hope some day to meet her 
On that bright celestial shore. 
And I 
know I'll be forgiven,' 
When I 
climb the golden stair, 
For within the gates of heaven, 
I 
shall find my mother there.

UNCLE PUMP'S RETURN. 
WRITTEN BY HARRY S. SARGENT. 
I 
am aged and gray, and my youth hab passed away 
FOR FALLON 
HALLISY. 
And ' fore many days I'll climb de golden stair; 
For de time am drawing nigh, when old 
Uncle Pomp will die, 
And go up to lib wid angels in de air. 
But 'fore I 
go above 1'11 see de ones I 
love, 
De ones for whom my heart hab often yearned; 
For de good old Dixie's land and dat joyous 
darkey band, 
! 
dey'll be glad old Uncle Pomp's returned. 
CHORUS. 
For I 
am happy now, and de sweat am on my brow, 
From trabbling on dis wicked world's highways, 
To Dixies, sure but slow, dat I 
left long ago, 
Oh! I 
nebber can forget dose happy days. 
I 
can't forget de day dat ole massa passed away, 
Which caused dis chile to stray away from home. 
But now dat I 
am here 'mong de ones dat am so dear, 
I 
nebber any more am going to roam. 
So I'll take de old banjo just as I 
used to do, 
And to de good kind Lord I'll sing my praise, 
And think foreber more of dem good old times 
of yore, 
For I 
nebber can forget dose happy days.

HIS 
BSI! 
OOMIC RECITATION BY HARRY S. 
He said he was an actor, 
And when I 
asked his " biz," 
Allowed he'd tackled Hamlet, 
And knew he might have riz, 
If he'd only been encouraged, 
But his business being bad, 
No manager would star him, 
They knew he'd prove a " cad." 
At last he struck a 
racket, 
With a 
show they said was " bum," 
And fell way down from Hamlet, 
. 
To " prop," and play the drum. 
And he used to do the '• heavies," 
Such as cleaning off the stage, 
And %% hen his " broom-act" came around. 
It set him in a 
rage. 
Before he'd bee ,1 
with them a 
week, 
He proved bin, self a " cake, -
For soon an in () mired, 
And " propy " got the shake. 
When starting on their southern tour 
This man without a 
brain. 
Had put the trunks and oiler props, 
Aboard the western train. 
And now he bangs about the town, 
Still hoping to secure 
(tne of those days a 
inaniger, 
Who'll take him on a 
tour. 
And he weekly takes the Clipper. 
At his neighbor Smith's expense, 
And SCAMS the letter eolunin 
In a 
manner quite intense. 
Somehow be never found the name 
For which he's often looked, 
lie's bored the managers so long. 
They all have got him booked; 
And in lien of acting Hamlet, 
They think the silly gull. 
With months of careful practice, 
Might impersonate the " skull." 
WRITTEN BY HARRY R. SARGENT. 
I'll sing you 'bout a 
dizzy dame, 
Who lived on baxter street; 
Her vase vas red und so vas her head, 
Tind she had such awful big feet. 
...Her maiden name was "`Sukey," 
Her eyes were squinty gray, 
I 
loved this little Venus so, 
I 
often had to say. 
Cnonns. 
I 
wish I 
was a 
crocodiie, 
Her ear I'd quickly chew, 
I'd like to be a 
monkey. 
On a 
bob-tailed kangaroo. 
lit put her in a 
cage with me, 
And tramp the country through, 
And bang up at the Cannibal Isles, 
With Hoop-de-doo-den-doo. 
She said her dad was wealthy, 
That he ( ,wried a 
pea-nut stand; 
So I 
asked this gal to be my wife, 
And join the happy praying band, 
To a 
picnic sail I 
took her. 
When she swallowed a 
great big clam; 
And \vastied it, down with a 
bottle of booze, 
And died with the aleckaymn.

POR PAUL IIAMLIN AND ADA NWWCOMAZ. 
Here we are two solid Micks, 
From far across the say; 
We landed at the Battery, 
A 
year ago to-day. 
Anti since that time we've traveled some, 
And seen the up and down 
Of this free land, and, and now, my boys, 
We've settled in this town. 
Cnonrs. 
So girls, give your attention, 
And wateh us do our tricks, 
For all the boys are jealous of 
The La-de-da-de Micks. 
Whin first we landed here, my bays, 
The blagguards used to shout; 
"say Cully, would yez stag the Micks, 
Go wash yer flannel mouth." 
But of that gang we took no note, 
We felt too mighty big, 
So kape yer eyes upon us, while 
We do an Irish jig. 
Since we've been in America, 
We've learned a 
thing or two, 
And to-night we've done our best 
To give yez something new. 
We've told ye all about ourselves, 
And show ye how we feel, 
So now we'll bid yez all good night, 
And do an Irish reel.

IN A 
FAIRY WOODLAND. 
WORDS BY HARRY S. SARORNT. 
MUSIC BY MISS JANLT ASHTON. 
In a 
fairy woodland by a 
running stream, 
Where the little birds sing so sweet; 
Lives a 
little charmer, dear one of my dream. 
How I've watched her little fairy feet. 
Tripping through the meadow, skipping o'p' 
the brook, 
Singing, dancing all the live long day; 
Close beside the streamlet in a 
shady nook, 
We passed so many happy hours away. 
CHORUS. 
In a fairy woodland by a 
running stream, 
Lives my little darling ' tis to be; 
Oft I 
meet this charmer, dear one of my dream, 
Underneath the greenwood tree. 
Down beside the streamlet where the daisies grow, 
There we pledged our love one starry night • 
While the tiny brooklet singing in its flow 
Made our future seem forever bright. 
Years to come may part us ne'er to meet again, 
Ne'er to press this darling to my heart, 
But in dreams I'll see hr tripping o'er the plain, 
When I 
first was pierced by Cupid's dart. 
Chorus.

WRIITEN BY HARRY S. SARGENT, 
FOR CARET AND HAILIX. 
Here we are two jovial lads, 
From merrie England's shore; 
We never shall forget the time 
Wo crossed the ocean o'er. 
And landed in America, 
The place to us so dear, 
To show the people one and all, 
The dance of Lancashire. 
CHORUS. 
So watch us while we execute 
The steps, and you will hear 
The music in the dancing of— 
The lads from Lancashire. 
(Dame. 
We took to dancing when we were 
Two little baby boys, 
And though the years have passed and gone, 
"Pis one of our greatest joys. 
We're just as happy as can be, 
As on through life we jog; 
Our greatest forte in dancing is 
The jig, the reel and clog. 
- Chorus. 
Now that we've done our best to please, 
We'll bid you all adieu, 
And hope we'll meet some future time, 
Your friendship to renew. 
We've shown you all those little steps, 
To Englishmen so dear; 
And n.)w we'll do tne .f-challenge seven,"

think of the day that we parted, 
When you left me to linger in dear Erin's isle; 
And in thinking of you I 
am sad broken-hearted, 
For you said you'd remember your Kathleen's 
sweet smile; 
But the years they have fled, yet I've heard 
from you never, 
And I 
think you've forgotten the days we

With the silence unbroken, our friendship

Though you told me you'd ne'er forget

Repeat last line. 
I 
ne'er can forget the sweet days of our childhood, 
In the bright long ago that can never return; 
How we prattled and played like the birds in 
the wildwood, 
And you vowed for my love that you ever 
would yearn, 
And now far away on the deep briny ocean, 
You've forgotten our vows of old Ireland so green, 
When I

HE Nr-VER SOLD. HIS VOTE. 
CONIC RECITATION BY HARRY S. 8.63011INT. 
I 
saw him tumble through the door, 
Amid the voter's din; 
His hat was caved, his coat was torn. 
His breath it smelt of gin. 
And as he gazed about the room, 
His ballots in his hand, 
The candidate's constituents 
They round him made a 
stand. 
And one by one they collared him, 
And whispered in his ear; 
" 
Jist paste this slip o'er that ere name, 
Then come and take a 
beer." 
And when they offered him a 
V, 
He then threw off his coat, 
And yelled at them most forcibly, 
" 
I 
never sell ley vote." 
I 
could but look upon ,tha.t man, 
And murmur with a 
sigh; 
"! 
had we thousands more like him. 
Votes would be scarce to buy. 
And as I 
gazed upon that form, 
So full of honor bright, 
I 
saw the crowd around him were 
A-spoiling for a 
fight. 
" 
Make way, make way ! a 
fellow cried, 
.‘ Hear what I've got to tell— 
That bummer's got no rignt to vote. 
J 
know it mighty well. 
Now don't o 
contradicting me, 
Why, darn it! blast my eyes 1 
I 
knew that chap in New Jersey— 
He's ns.it been naturalized." 
The mob then fell upon that man, 
And fired him in the street; 
They rolled him in the mud and min, 
And did him soundly beat, 
And as he rose all broken up, 
These simple words he quote; 
If I 
live here for fifty years, 
I'll never sling a 
vote.

THEYIE STRANGERS TO YOU. 
When You're Broke. 
WORDS BY BARRY S. SAEGENT. MUSIC BY CHAS. J. 317BGEB, 
When your pockets all clink with the jingle of gold, 
And your costume is one of the best; 
Your friends will flock 'rouud you like sheep in 
the fokl,. 
'Till their company has proven a pest. > t; 
But should grim misfortune come suddenly on, 
Bear in mind what I 
say, 'tis no joke; 
You'll find that the friends that have bled you so long, 
Are strangers to you when you're broke. 
CHORUS. 
Then look to yourself in prosperity's hours, 
Or your friends they hill vanish like smoke, 
And when on you the cloud of grim poverty lowers, 
They're strangers to you when you're broke 
There's many a 
man who has squandered his gold, 
On people he thought were his friends; 
Though he imagined himself he had treasures untold, 
They have dwindled down into tens, 
'Tis then he will wish for the days past and gone, 
For he's down like a 
wheel without spokes, 
Should he ask an old friend just to help him along, 
He's a 
stranger to him when he's broke. 
Choruli. 
Now mind what I 
say, and you'll find I 
am right, 
Though not every case, to be sure; 
And when you are rich and your gar shining bright, 
Just open your purse to the poor. 
But beware of those people who round you will flock, 
And give you the best of a 
joke, 
When they praise you up highly, in them take no stools 
They'd be strangers to you when you're broke. 
Chorus. 
GEORGY DEM YOU'RE- AWFUL BAIL 
WRITTEN AND SUNG BY HARRY S. SARGENT. 
Some time ago I 
met a 
girl, 
Her name I'll never tell; 
I 
loved this dear with all my heart, 
And thought she loved as well. 
I 
used to meet her every eve, 
To pass the time away; 
And When I 
asked her for a 
kiss, 
The darling girl would say. 
CHORUS. 
Georgy dear, Georgy dear, don't you touch 
me or I'll holler, 
For you know, yes, you do, that my pa'd 
be awful mad, 
Georgy dear, Georgy dear, I 
wouldn't let you 
for a 
dollar, 
Only think what folks would say—you're 
awful, awful bad. 
One day I 
took this little dear, 
Down by the river side; 
And as we strolled along, I 
asked 
Her, if she'd be my bride. 
She threw her sweetest smile at me, 
Which made me feel so gay, 
I 
put my arm around her waist, 
When to me she did say. 
Chorus. 
And now she's shook her darling George, 
My heart is filled with woe; 
I 
never shall forget this dear, 
No matter where I 
go. 
And though the years have passed and gone, 
I'm sad as sad can be, 
When thinking of this little dear, 
And what she said to me. 
Chorus.

THE LITTLE LOCK OF HAIR. 
WRITTEN AND SUNG BY HARRY S. SARGENT. 
There's an ivy covered cottage in the woodland, 
Close beside the bubbling streamlet's flow; 
Where I 
used to while the happy hours away, 
.With my darling Jennie in the long ago. 
But that time has passed and ne'er will'come again, 
For one summer's eve they laid her down to sleep 
With the angels on the bright and golden shore, 
And a 
lock of hair is all I've got to keep. 
CHORUS. 
That was plucked from her brow on the day 
that she died, 
And that little lock I'll cherish and 
save; 
To her memory so dear I'll often shed a 
tear, 
For she's sleeping in the cold and silent grave, 
I 
never can forget the day she died, 
For with her went my only hope and joy: 
And in my dreams I 
often see her now, 
For I 
fell in love with her when but a boy. 
And the happy future conjured up before me, 
Has vanished, and l'ra broken down with care; 
Yet I 
hope some day to meet her up in heaven, 
And I'll always keep that little lock of hair.

I'm one of the swells, as you can all see, 
I 
mash all the gals, I 
come from Tralee 
Out on the walk the girls say I'm style, 
For they all wink, and they blink, and they smile, 
They say I'm their darling, their own little dear, 
They smile at me sweet, and I 
feel awful queer, 
And when T go out on the street every day, 
The girls all passing by you might hear them all say.

My costume's so fine, it can't be excelled; 
My hat's of the line that is never expelled, 
My high water pants they make the gawks stare, 
And the very next day they all order a

For they say I'm the style that catches them all,

In eighteen hundred and sixty one, 
The war it first broke out; 
The poor unfortunate Irishmen 
Were scattered all about. 
The rich man would not go and fight. 
But for the poor ones they did hunt; 
Then hand in hand to Dixie's land, 
Went the Irishmen to the front. 
CHORUS. 
Then give a 
cheer for we Yankee boys, 
For the enemy we must hunt, 
So hand in hand to Dixie's Land, 
Went the Irishmen to the front. 
When we got on board the train, 
We had not been long gone; 
Until we found our enemy; 
Were about ten thousand strong. 
We sent back telegraph despatches, 
And such time was never made, 
When Gen McClellan our little Mac, 
Led on the Irish Brigade.

And the old school house has cone to ?teeny,

THE BLUE ALSATIAN MOUNTAINS 
WY CLAILIBELL. 
MUSIC BY STEPHEN .1.1/LICS 
By the blue Alsatian mountains, 
Dwelt a 
maiden young and fair; 
Like the careless flowing fountains 
Were the ripples of her hair. 
Were the ripples of her hair; 
Angel mild, her eyes so winning, 
1:ige.1 bright her happy smile, 
When beneath the fountain spinning, 
A-de, A-de, Ade, 
Such songs will pass away; 
Tho' the blue Alsatian mountains, 
Seem to watch and wait alway! 
By the blue Alsatian mountains, 
Many spring-times bloomed and passid, 
And the maiden by the fountains, 
Saw she lost her hopes at last, 
She lost her hopes at last. 
And she withered like a 
flower, 
That is waiting for the rain; 
She will never see the stranger, 
Where the fountains fall again. 
A-de, A-de, A-de, 
The years have passed away, 
But the 
mountains 
Ever watch ar,.4' 
at alway, 
A- de, A-de, A-de. 
The years have parse a 
away, 
But the blue ils&in mountains, 
Seem to watoh and 
tit alway. 
By the blue Alsatiir- -- mountains, 
CAIlle a 
stral . the spring. 
And he lingerea uy the fountains, 
Just to hear the maiden sing, 
Just to hear the maiden sing; 
Just to whisper in the moonlight, 
Words the sweetest she had known, 
Just to charm away the hours, 
Till her heart was all his own. 
A-do, A- de, A- de, 
Such dreams must pass awa7,,.

Unto your busy city. 
I'm a

My maiden name is Tilly,

He came to us one day,

His trousers needed mending; 
Oh! lie could dance and sing, 
Beat any circus man a-bending. 
But now he's gone away, 
And left his little Tilly, 
I

I'll die without my Billy. 
To the one that brings him back, 
I'll pay ten dollars in a

Just tell him, that his own, 
His dear, his darling Tilly,

Years faded away, yet since that- day, 
You've been all the world to me. 
But we're no longer young, Louige, 
And silver shades the gold; 
My thoughts oft flow to the long ago, 
Where first my love I 
told; 
But you are just as dear, Louise, 
And just as fair to see; 
Though years have fled since first I 
said, 
You are all the world to me 
Moms,

Geederening, kind friends, I'll sing you a 
ditty, 
It's of dear old Ireland the sweet Luid of song, 
I 
will sing you of heroes, of men iron- hearted, 
Of brave ones, and of true ones, to Ireland belong, 
For the day we are longing when we'll see Erin free, 
And all sons of Ireland strike for liberty, 
For starved and oppressed. they're stricken with awe, 
They're driven from Ireland, and Erin g Bragh. 
CEIORU .3. 
Then farewell to Ireland. the place I 
was born sis, 
Farewell to Erin, the fairea of earth, 
Farewell till liberty on us is dawning, 
Farewell to Ireland the land of my birth. 
The sweet girls of Erin tc.e 
hopeful yet weeping, 
They're singing for freedom which to them belong. 
And the heroes of Ireland whose name 1 
will mention, 
Whose fame in Irish hist'ry is marked very strong, 
There was Dani,1 
O'Connell a %veil known hero bold, 
And brave Robert Emmett, we're always been told, 
They fotight for old Ireland were true to the core. 
'14y eyed that dear shamrock and Erin go Bragk.

Sure I 
thought I'd make a call, 
So I 
am here to greet you all, 
And to thank ye for yere welcome to a 
stranger; 
I 
got a 
job of work, 
Since I 
landed in New York, 
But my work is attended with great danger, 
For a mason's clerk am I, 
One whose always climbing high, 
And the hod and ladder is my occupation; 
But for politics I'm bound, 
And I'm bound to get around, 
To assist in making laws for this great nation. 
CHORUS. 
Paddy Duff',- is my name, 
I 
will always be the same, 
Whether rich or poor, of high or low degree; 
Like Muldoon the solid guy, 
A bold specimen am I, 
Of a self-made, high-toned gentleman, you see 
(Dance.) 
Otfe day while on the ladder, 
Oh ! 1 
never yet got madder, 
Then I 
did upon that very same occasion; 
Some bricks fell from my hod, 
And lit upon the nob 
Of a German peddlar of the Jew persuasion; 
Sheeney called hard names to Pat, 
For the bricks had broke his hat; 
I 
was angry, and the truth I 
had to. 
Oh ! sez I, you dirty Jew, 
But f'or your ancestors, like you, 
The Lord would be ali vo to-day, and doinz wen

How often have we lingered 
There, t,gether, you alid I, 
To one another told our love, 
When no one elt,e 
was nigh. 
Ah! those happy days have fled, 
Like the waters of the rill. 
That glided by —  
with merry song— 
'lite old bench near the 
CHORUS. 
The miller long has zone to rest, 
The clanking wheel hangs still, 
For everything has gone lo uin, 
hut the old bench near the will. 
Old winter's snows have come and gone, 
Spring Inuit decked with beauteous flowers, 
The irvetinv, place whrre you and I 
Have pamsed such happy hours. 
Now 1 
wander there alone, 
Yet fancy oft cloth fill 
The spot where I 
loive held thy form, 
On the • Id bench near the mill.

TO THE CITIZENS OF CLEVELAND, ORIO. 
With steady step, and muffled drum, 
The cortege passed along; 
And dreaded silence reigned supreme 
Amid the mighty throng. 
The somber tolling of the bells, 
Reminded us in time we must 
Just like our President, 
Return from dust to dust. 
Men with heads uncovered, 
Would mutter Guitau's name; 
And the wishes of each one, 
I 
am certain were the same. 
And if from jail he once were free, 
No power on . arth could save 
The olan that sent our President 
To hi.-4 
mu init-lv grave. 
We say, the strt.ets in mourning, 
Which ever way you would go; 
And f.-.-ery one their sympathy 
In some way tried t
,, show. 
Many a 
wife and m. ; ther, 
A 
fervent prayer has said, 
And taught it to their little ones 
Before they went to bed. 
And when the sufferer was laid 
In his last resting place, 
Then came an aged colored man, 
With the tears running down his faCh 
He bought a 
little bouquet, 
With a 
card marked Uncle Dave,' 
He said it was all he had to give 
For Master Gaptield's grave. 
How sad it is, indeed, to see 
His patient hopeful wife, 
And and gray haired mother, 
For him she would give her life, 
How different their feelings were, 
While about him they did stand; 
When honored with the highest placa, 
There is in our free land. 
Let us hope that his successor, 
Will be as fit to rule, and be a man 
That can't be made the politician's tool, 
o 
peaceful rest the ashes of our soldier, 
True and brave, and our nation's tears 
Will moist the earth on James A Garfield's Grave.

Now Peter Brown was a nice young man, 
Of the age of twenty-one; 
So upon his birth-day he set forth, 
To have a 
little fun. 
He learned the game of faro. 
So he thought he'd try his luck, 
When he lost every cent the boys all naiad, 
Peter, has the comet struck. 
CHOBIJR.: 
Where was Peter when the comet struck, 
Why did Peter at the " Tiger" buck; 
Pay, Pety, Pete, I 
think you'd better treat, 
Peter has the comet struck. 
That night bewent out to see his girl. 
And the question he did pop; 
So he gave her his watch and chain, 
And Peter didn't drop. 
Until he found she'd shook him, 
And was on another struck, 
For silo gave the watch and chain to het decor
