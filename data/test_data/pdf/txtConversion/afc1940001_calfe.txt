Nichols, one of the Argonauts fromMassachusetts, composed a song entitled "The California

"The California Emigrant""Like Argos of the ancient times,I'll leave this modern Greece;I'm bound
to California mines,To find the Golden fleece.For who would work from morn to nightAnd live on
hog and corn,When one can pick up there at sightEnough to buy a farm.Chorus:"O California! that's
the land for me,I'm going to California the gold dust for to see."There from the snowy mountain
side,Comes down the golden sand,And spreads a carpet far and wideO'er all the shining land;The
rivers run on golden beds,O'er rocks of golden ore,The valleys six feet deep are saidTo hold a plenty
more.Chorus: "O California, etc.""I'll take my wash bowl in my hand,And thither wind my way,To wash
the gold from out the sand,In California.And when I get my pocket full,In that bright land of goldI'll
have a rich and happy time;Live merry till I'm old.Chorus: "O California, etc."
