SEM CONFERENCE 11/89
 
PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT:  LESSONS IN ACTIVE ETHNOMUSICOLOGY
 
Practice makes perfect -
-
 an ancient aphorism that only
 
makes sense in situations where there is general agreement as to
 
what perfection consists of.
 Working across either cultural or
 
class  lines will soon indicate that the nature of perfection -
-
or imperfection for that matter -
-
 is highly debatable.
 From my
 
observation post at the National Endowment for the Arts where we
 
find ourselves involved with perhaps 150 totally different
 
cultural projects during a single year,  I can testify that
 
determining the particular degree of perfection attained by each
 
of these efforts has turned out to be pretty tricky,  to say the
 
least.
 
Now my colleague,  Daniel Sheehy,  has already suggested that
 
applied ethnomusicology must be approached in terms of purpose,
 
strategy,  techniques,  and evaluation.
 I am going to assume for
 
this paper that all those here are prepared to come to grips
 
with why they might want to do something and how they might
 
decide to do it.
 I intend to  leap immediately into a discussion
 
- 2 -
of how one might tell after the fact whether of not those
 
decisions were effective.
 
I first faced this issue in 1978 when I learned that in
 
expending governmental moneys,  some kind of formal evaluation
 
was required,  no question about it.
 This seemed reasonable but
 
the activities funded by the Folk Arts Program were so varied,  I
 
found I simply didn't have any idea how to go about it.
 
Finally,  I asked for help from Professor John Szwed,  at that
 
time at the University of Pennsylvania and also a member of Folk
 
Arts'  reviewing panel.
 Professor Szwed is possessed of a
 
remarkable,  adult and subtle mind and enjoys,  as the old folk
 
joke puts it,  "defining the indefinable and unscrewing the
 
inscrutable."
 
Some weeks  later,  I asked him how he was coming on and he
 
told me a most instructive story.
 Quite a large number,  he
 
said,  of Washington bureaucrats were,  like me, worrying about
 
just how to do all this evaluation business,  so much so that the
 
principal evaluators from all the agencies were getting together
 
weekly for luncheon meetings where they could share experiences
 
and problems.
 John finally managed to meet with them and
 
enquired of the assembled experts if they had determined any
 
-3-
single principle of evaluation that they had all agreed upon,
 
one that worked reliably under any and all circumstances.
 
After due consideration,  the answer came -
-
 yes.
 They had
 
indeed determined one immutable and totally reliable principle.
 
Under no circumstances,  they told John, could the results of any
 
action be determined before it was necessary to take the next
 
action...
 I
'm going to say that again .
.
.
 Under no
 
circumstances can the results of any action be determined before
 
it is necessary to undertake the next action.
 
Well.
 z had to admit, my entire life's experience had led
 
me to much the same conclusion, though I didn't know how to
 
articulate it in such a crisp and devastating formula.
 In
 
certain respects it was actually kind of liberating.
 If nobody 
could tell the result of any action in time to correct the next
 
action accordingly,  then everybody was working in pretty much
 
the same
 
based on
 
history.
 
way -
-
 trying out what seemed logical and might work,
 
parallel observations and one's own reading of
 
The Szwed Principle certainly validated the open-ended
 
and relaxed approach taken in the Folk Arts guidelines, but I
 
did have to admit it did not offer much help in exactly how to
 
evaluate the resulting activities.
 And neither did the other
 
-4--
methods I investigated, most of which turned out to involve one
 
kind of questionnaire or another.
 (Personally,  I have never yet
 
found a questionnaire that was the least bit of use in eliciting
 
information on the planning, operation or results of projects in
 
either folklore or ethnomusicology.)
 
Take,  for example,  a "simple" concert.
 One would think that
 
a straightforward test for such an event might be the number of
 
people who attended.
 But suppose they came and then wished they
 
hadn't?
 Suppose lots of people came and the event was so boring
 
that everybody went home at intermission?
 Suppose nobody came
 
at all, hardly, but the performers had a wonderful party and
 
thought it was the greatest thing that ever happened?  Whose
 
perfection are we looking at?  The person who booked the hall?
 
The funding agency?
 The artists?
 The audience?
 
I can tell you about a remarkable occasion when hardly
 
anybody came,  and five years later, people are still talking
 
about what a seminal concert it was and how many significant
 
developments have  stemmed directly out of that ostensibly
 
"disastrous" event in later years.
 
It was indeed a "simple" concert -
-
 conceived of and
 
-5-
energized by a single person essentially -
-
 an independent
 
researcher and discographer named Douglas Seroff who had spent
 
many years of
 
straightening
 
unaccompanied
 
that had been
 
true labor of
 
unpublished.
 
self-imposed drudgery discovering and
 
out the complex history of the African-American
 
vocal quartet movement, especially that part of it
 
captured on 78 r
.p.m.  records.
 This had been a
 
love -
-
 essentially unpaid, unsolicited and
 
A few years ago he came up with what he thought was a
 
wonderful idea for a concert -
 a grand reunion of all the
 
old-time African-American a capella quartets that had risen up
 
around the city of Birmingham, Alabama during the 20's,  30's and
 
40's,  the hey-day of quartet singing.
 He elicited Folk Arts
 
support at the Endowment,  (which is bureaucratese for he got a
 
grant), he tracked down the old-time singers now scattered from
 
California to Brooklyn, he wrote and edited and published a
 
program containing the best of his historical photographs of the
 
older quartets and biographies of the
 
history of the movement.
 He rented a
 
great concerts had been put on in the
 
singers and an over-view
 
hall where many of the
 
old days and lined up
 
radio and newspaper publicity,  and engaged almost half of a
 
nearby motel where the 50-odd singers and their families could
 
-6-
be accommodated.
 Most of the singers you see,  had moved away
 
and were inactive; the general opinion was that a capella
 
quartet singing was dead or dying throughout the south.
 
I came down from Washington for the grand occasion.
 It was
 
in a cavernous hall holding perhaps 3000 people,  fronted by an
 
enormous stage with an absolute forest of microphones, maybe
 
twenty of them strung across in a fragile line.
 And when the
 
performance began, peering around me in the gloom,  I could see
 
no more than perhaps 50 people,  though I later heard there were
 
200 more scattered through the hail.
 And at least five of them
 
were from the Endowment.
 It was hard to know where to look,
 
what to do, what to say.
 But then the first quartet came
 
striding out on the stage,  all duded up in matching pin-striped
 
suits and ruffled white shirts,  full of excitement,  raring to
 
go.
 They grabbed four microphones at random and began to sing
 
with obvious and unblemished delight in the power and excitement
 
of their own performance.
 Other old gentlemen peeked out from
 
the wings whooping them on,  running out to give them high fives
 
and big hugs between songs.
 
The audience began to cheer up.
 We clapped and stamped
 
trying to make up in enthusiasm for our small numbers.
 And the
 
-7-
quartets kept coming,  one after another, bounding out like young
 
Michael Jacksons onto the stage,  ripping the mikes off their
 
stands and parading down through the empty aisles as though
 
thousands were cheering them on.
 As we left the hail at the
 
end, one of the wives who had been sitting near me turned and
 
said, her face glowing with triumph,  "Well now, wasn't that the
 
nicest thing?  When are we going to do it again!"
 
I just couldn't answer her.
 From every technical point of
 
view,  it could hardly have been worse.
 The sound in the hail
 
was appalling,  as the excited singers grabbed microphon after
 
microphone and put them back on the wrong stands; by the end of
 
the evening,  the cords were literally in knots all over the
 
stage and after the first few numbers, we never head a balanced
 
sound again.
 None of the quartets would leave the stage until
 
total exhaustion had set in,  so the whole thing dragged on for
 
hours until well past midnight.
 And -
-
 bleakest of all
 the
 
local audience had simply not shown up; they had not supported
 
their own.
 A Black folklorist friend and I discussed it in
 
whispers.
 Had the whole idea been mis-timed?
 Had it been the
 
wrong thing to do to begin with?
 Had the execution been at
 
fault?
 Had some terrible cultural gaffes been made?
 
-8-
Still,  as I flew back to Washington,  it just didn't feel
 
that wrong.
 Something about that bizarre event had been an
 
absolutely resounding success.
 I kept remembering the breakfast
 
the morning after the concert, when I was in the dumps but when
 
about twenty of the singers had sat hours at the table,  filling
 
themselves with grits and sausages and falling out with laughter
 
over story after story about their early singing exploits -
-
which little country churches they had sung in, how they had
 
duded themselves up, how they had shined up their shoes and
 
their rattle-trap old cars so as to look prosperous and
 
professional, which songs they had sung, what strategies they
 
had used to put down the previous singing groups, what a blast
 
that whole life had been, how much it had meant to them...
 
Well,  as I said,  I flew back to Washington and in the
 
fullness of time,  I closed out the grant,  took several quiet
 
breaths hoping that nobody would notice that the ordinary
 
measures of success hadn't been fulfilled,  that the project
 
hadn't produced the results that might have been expected.
 
Heck,  that I would have expected.
 I
'm no different from anybody
 
else in this culture;  I want lots and lots of big numbers to
 
validate the beauty and importance of what I help present.  But
 
-9-
in this case,  I guess I hoped not too many people would even
 
notice that it had happened.
 
But back in Birmingham, Douglas Seroff's thorough and
 
scholarly and fact-filled program booklet began to circulate.
 
The Alabama State Folk Arts Coordinator made sure that a number
 
of the most forward-looking high school music programs got
 
copies,  and he made sure also that local school music teachers
 
knew that there were several African-American a capella quartets
 
of historical significance still working in the Birmingham
 
district.
 These groups began to appear at a few school assembly
 
programs and everywhere they appeared they handed out copies of
 
the program booklet.
 (There were a lot left over -
 might as
 
well get them around.)
 Douglas Seroff and others began to
 
establish a more solid relationship with the Black disc jockeys
 
of Birmingham,  a few of whom began to broadcast the older
 
recordings along with some new cuts from Brenda McCallum's
 
record (brought out two years after the concert) of the classic
 
Birmingham quartet singers.
 (Folk Arts also helped fund that
 
project,  by the way.)
 The fabled Fairfield Four Quartet of
 
Nashville that had been reunited for the Birmingham event stayed 
reunited and began appearing together again regularly.
 
And then one day Folk Arts heard from the people at the
 
Bureau of Florida Folklife that some folks in Jacksonville,
 
Florida  (original home of the Five Blind Boys) were interested
 
in having an a capella quartet concert too,  and
 
ethnomusicologist Doris Dyen went in to help on that one.
 Her
 
devoted and professional work in sound reinforcement and other
 
technical assistance helped to put on a musically exciting
 
concert that was also poorly attended.
 But then folklorist
 
David Evans'  students  in Memphis began to talk about a quartet
 
concert there,  and i
t also ultimately came to pass,  with
 
folklorist Kip Lornell and others  lending a hand.
 
A year or so  later I began asking my southern-based friends
 
about the state of a capella quartet singing in their areas,  and
 
they mostly reported that it was simmering along--that most
 
groups had annual home-comings,  that the younger men still went
 
out to sing in the more remote churches,  that women's quartets
 
were certainly not unheard of and in some areas were becoming
 
downright fashionable,  that there were still some of the
 
old-time "trainers,"  active senior singers who go around and put
 
the final polishing touches to the younger groups--little
 
pieces of news  like that which led me to feel that on the whole
 
this tradition is moving along as one would hope it would -
 if
 
you loved it -
 differently in different places,  firmly attached
 
-11-
to its roots but out there in the sunshine too.
 Douglas Seroff
 
put on a highly successful concert at the auditorium in Fisk
 
University last year honoring the Fairfield Four quartet,  (and
 
that was a breakthrough event there)  and he is currently in
 
negotiation with Ladysmith Black Mambazo to put on a joint a
 
capella concert with the Sterling Jubilees Quartet,  since it
 
turns out that the two groups like each other 's sound.
 
Well,  plainly,  this is a story that hasn't ended yet.
 But I
 
do think there are a few lessons to be drawn from what we've
 
seen happen so far in this African-American a capella quartet
 
singing business,  ideas that might help shape some future
 
activities.
 I am not going to try to consider why the local
 
community
 black and white -
-
 did not support that original
 
concert.
 It seems possible that certain special unknown norms
 
for successful African-American event organization in Birmingham
 
were not observed, but I don't know for sure.
 I think it is
 
equally possible to predict that the first few times anything is
 
tried, especially in a conservative black community,  it may well
 
not be widely supported -
 not until the word gets around.
 What
 
I can outline for you with some hope for accuracy are a few of
 
the factors that went into the long-range fruitfulness of the
 
concert:
 
-12-
1)
 The musical tradition celebrated had real
 
historical depth and real cultural significance and meaning -
 and
 
it was  intrinsically gorgeous.
 It was  important.
 
2)
 The research into the tradition had been done with
 
great thoroughness and scholarly care,  resulting--among other
 
things--in the logical selection of Birmingham, Alabama,  a
 
major center in the development of quartet singing,  as the
 
concert site.
 (Other centers could have been chosen,  of course,
 
but this was one of the important ones.
 The concert was not
 
staged in Hollywood,  or Washington,  DC,  or New York City or
 
other more fashionable venues.)
 
3)
 Again,  as the result of  intensive research,  the
 
right singers had been invited,  the right ones in this case being
 
all the groups that had participated in the development of the
 
Birmingham style.
 Not everyone was still alive or could
 
participate,  but all the
 
attempt had been made to
 
included.
 And that made
 
singers present knew that a serious
 
include everybody who should have been
 
for an atmosphere of joyful relaxation
 
amongst the singers.
 They were having a reunion--who cared
 
about anything else.
 
-13-
4) The actual research was presented back to the researched
 
community in an inexpensive, profusely illustrated,  interesting,
 
verifiable form.
 It is impossible to look at that program
 
booklet and not be impressed by the extraordinary story of the
 
development of quartet singing in Birmingham.
 The availability
 
of solid pains-taking scholarship has the effect of empowerment
 
to the community studied,  allowing the development of legitimate
 
pride.
 It can form a bridge,  too,  for contact across caste and
 
class lines.
 But it has to be made available,  and that requires
 
major effort.
 
5
) And then there was a concert.
 The living singers
 
came together,  and they opened their throats and poured their
 
passion and skill and liveliness and humor out over the empty
 
hail,  and no one who heard them could ever be convinced that
 
this was a dying art.
 I am in favor of books, publications of
 
all kinds, musical transcriptions,  tapes,  records,  films, but in
 
spite of all the technological and electronic gadgetry in the
 
world,  the primary gestating act of music,  I believe, only
 
happens when musicians and listeners assemble.
 
At the beginning of this talk I put the evaluation problem
 
-14-
to you within a bureacratic context,  and I complained,  in a
 
typical self-pitying bureaucratic way,  about the nonsensicalness
 
of having to work out evaluation methods.
 But evaluation is a
 
real problem and it exists out there in the real world, not just
 
in terms of governmental requirements.
 Evaluation doesn't just
 
happen on paper.
 We may never have to fill in an evaluation
 
form, but the hard fact is that we  do go on evaluating our own
 
and others' work in this field continually.
 
And when I say "we" here I mean everybody -
-
 artists,
 
audiences, everyone who has been touched in any way by the
 
particular event.
 Everyone evaluates -
-
 out loud or in
 
silence.
 And on the basis of those evaluations, the next event
 
will rise or decline, will grow or shrink, will take place  or
 
die a-borning.
 We all need to try to become better evaluators,
 
more cogent critics, broader in range, more precise and more
 
understanding.
 Our evaluations are important -
-
 everybody's
 
evaluations are important.
 
One way in which we could improve our evaluations would be
 
to try to remember that cultural events reflect many interests,
 
that these interests may and generally do vary,  that one man's
 
success may be another man's tedium or even disaster.
 We should
 
-15-
try to notice these variances and think very specifically about
 
them.
 Then we could work at breaking down the significant
 
component elements of a cultural event as I just tried to do for
 
you in describing the Birmingham quartet concert;  in that case,
 
you recall,  I pulled out as important variables the nature of
 
the tradition itself,  the location of the event,  the scholarly
 
research effort, the publication record,  and finally the
 
experience of the artists themselves.
 
But I am beginning to think that the most important
 
perspective to maintain in all our analyses is the long-term.
 
The Birmingham concert was one highly visible move in a long
 
series of events,  some coming
 
converging around the central
 
Black a capella quartet music
 
before and some after,  all
 
tradition of African-American
 
in all its splendor.
 My deep
 
concern over the lack of attendance resulted from my not taking
 
into consideration the events leading up to the concert and my
 
ignorance of what would happen in future.
 I should have known
 
better.
 
Those of us who find a particular kind of music thrilling or
 
those who simply think the world is a more interesting place
 
because it contains this and many other such musics, need to
 
A-
 
-16--
bear in mind that it takes more than one concert or recording
 
project or research effort if a tradition is to continue lively
 
and creative.
 We should try to hang on to a long-range
 
perspective; we should try to look at events in the context of
 
what has gone before and what could come after; we should temper
 
our evaluation of the moment with some understanding that there
 
has been a past and there will be a future.
 And,  as
 
ethnomusicologists,  I believe that a part of that future is our
 
especial responsibility.
 
As I said at the beginning,  practice makes perfect

that everybody went home at intermission?
 Suppose nobody came
 
"
 
at all,  hardly, but the performers b  ow
de 4ul per4y and
 
thought it was the greatest thing that ever happened?  Whose
 
perfection are we looking at?  The person who booked the hall?
 
The funding agency?
 The artists?
 The audience?
 
I can tell you about a remarkable occasion when hardly
 
anybody came,  and five years later,  people are still talking
 
about what a seminal concert it was and how many significant
 
developments have  stemmed directly out of that ostensibly
 
"disastrous" event in later years.
 
It was indeed a "simple" concert -
-
 conceived of and
 
-5-
researcher and discographer named Douglas Seroff who had spent
 
many years of
 
straightening
 
unaccompanied
 
that had been
 
true labor of
 
unpublished.
 
self-imposed drudgery discovering and
 
out the complex history of the African-American
 
vocal quartet movement,  especially that part of it
 
captured on 78 r
.p.m.  records.
 This had been a
 
love -
-
 essentially unpaid, unsolicited and
 
A few years ago he came up with what he thought was a
 
wonderful idea for a concert -
 a grand reunion of all the
 
old-time African-American a capella quartets that had risen up
 
around the city of Birmingham, Alabama during the 20's,  30's and
 
40's,  the hey-day of quartet singing.
 He elicited Folk Arts
 
support at the Endowment,  (which is bureaucratese for he got a
 
grant),  he tracked down the old-time singers now scattered from
 
California to Brooklyn, he wrote and edited and published a
 
program containing the best of his historical photographs of the
 
older quartets
 
history of the
 
great concerts
 
and biographies of the singers and an over-view
 
movement.
 He rented a hall where many of the
 
had been put on in the old days and lined up
 
radio and newspaper publicity,  and engaged almost half of a
 
nearby motel where the 50-odd sinners and their fnmilipq rnn1'

be accommodated.

quartet singing was dead or dying
t
h
-t-
se 4h.
 
I came down from Washington for the grand occasion.
 It was
 
in a cavernous hail holding perhaps 3000 people,  fronted by an
 
enormous stage with an absolute forest of microphones, maybe
 
twenty of them strung across in a fragile line.
 And when the
 
performance began,  peering around me in the gloom,  I could see
 
no more than perhaps 50 people,  though I later heard there were
 
,
' O more scattered through the hail.
 And at least five of them
 
were from the Endowment.
 It was hard to know where to look,
 
what to do, what to say.
 But then the first quartet came
 
striding out on the stage,  all duded up in matching pin-striped
 
suits and ruffled white shirts,  full of excitement,  raring to
 
go.
 They grabbed four microphones at random and began to sing
 
with obvious and unblemished delight in the power and excitement
 
of their own performance.
 Other old gentlemen peeked out from
 
the wings whooping them on,  running out to give them high fives
 
and big hugs between songs.
 
The audience began to cheer up.
 We clapped and stamped
 
trying to make up in enthusiasm for our small numbers.
 And the
 
1
1
 C
 
-7-
quartets kept coming,  one after another, bounding out like young
 
Michael Jacksons onto the stage,
 
stands and parading down through
 
thousands were cheering them on.
 
ripping the mikes off their
 
the empty aisles as though
 
As we left the hall at the
 
end, one of the wives who had been sitting near me turned and
 
said, her face glowing with triumph,  "Well now, wasn't that the
 
nicest thing?  When are we going to do it again!"
 
I just couldn't answer her.
 From every technical point of
 
view,  it could hardly have been worse.
 The sound in the hall
 
was appalling,  as the excited singers grabbed microphon after
 
microphone and put them back on the wrong stands; by the end of
 
the evening,  the cords were literally in knots all over the
 
stage and after the first few numbers, we never head a balanced
 
sound again.
 None of the quartets would leave the stage until
 
total exhaustion had set in,  so the whole thing dragged on for
 
hours until well past midnight.
 And -
-
 bleakest of all -
-
 the
 
local audience had simply not shown up; they had not supported
 
their own.
 A Black folklorist friend and I discussed it in
 
whispers.
 Had the whole idea been mis-timed?
 Had it been the
 
wrong thing to do to begin with?
 Had the execution been at
 
fault?
 Had some terrible cultural gaffes been made?
 
-8-
Still,  as I flew back to Washington,  it just didn't feel
 
that wrong.
 Something about that bizarre event had been an
 
absolutely resounding success.
 I kept remembering the breakfast
 
the morning after the concert, when I was in the dumps but when
 
about twenty of the singers had sat hours at the / table s filling
 
themselves with grits and sausages and falling out with laughter
 
over story after story about their early singing exploits -
-
which little country churches they had sung in, how they had
 
duded themselves up,  how they had shined up their shoes and
 
their rattle-trap old cars so as to look prosperous and
 
professional, which songs they had sung, what strategies they
 
had used to put down the previous singing groups, what a blast
 
that whole life had been  how1ñiiEi
 t had meant to them...
 
I flew back to Washington and in the
 
fullness of time,  I closed out the grant "took several quiet
 
breaths hoping that nobody would notice that the ordinary
 
measures of success hadn't been fulfilled,  that the project
 
hadn't produced the results that might have been expected. j , 74.,c

 that I would have expected.
 
I want lots and lots of big numbers to
 
validate the beauty and importance of what I help present.  But
 
-9-
in this case,  I guess I hoped not too many people would even
 
notice that it had happened.
 
But back in Birmingham, Douglas Seroff's thorough and
 
scholarly and fact-filled program booklet began to circulate.
 
The Alabama State Folk Arts Coordinator made sure that a number
 
of the most forward-looking high school music programs got
 
copies,  and he made sure also that local school music teachers
 
knew that there were several African-American a capella quartets
 
of historical significance still working in the Birmingham
 
district.
 These groups began to appear at a few school assembly
 
programs and everywhere they appeared they handed out copies of
 
the program booklet.
 (There were a lot left over.)- mi
 az
 
Douglas Seroff and others began to
 
establish a more solid relationship with the Black disc jockeys
 
of Birmingham,  a few of whom began to broadcast the older
 
recordings along with some new cuts from Brenda McCallurn's
 
record (brought out two years after the concert) of the classic
 
Birmingham quartet singers.
 (Folk Arts also helped fund that
 
proiecta)by-
er)
 The fabled Fairfield Four Quartet of
 
Nashville that had been reunited for the Birmingham event stayed 
reunited and began appearing together again regularly.
 
-10-
And then one day Folk Arts heard from the people at the
 
Bureau of Florida Folklife that some folks  in Jacksonville,
 
Florida  (original home of the Five Blind Boys) were interested
 
in having an a capella quartet concert too,  and
 
ethnomusicologist Doris Dyen went in to help on that one.
 Her
 
devoted and professional work in sound reinforcement and other
 
technical assistance helped to put on a musically exciting
 
concert that was also poorly attended.
 But then folklorist
 
David Evans'  students  in Memphis began to talk about a quartet
 
concert there,  and it also ultimately came to pass,  with
 
folklorist Kip Lornell and others  lending a hand.
 
A year or so  later I began asking my southern-based friends
 
about the state of a capella quartet singing in their areas,  and
 
they mostly reported that it was simmering along--that most
 
groups had annual home-comings,  that the younger men still went
 
out to sing in the more remote churches,  that women's quartets
 
were certainly not unheard of and in some areas were becoming
 
downright fashionable,  that there were still some of the
 
old-time "trainers,"  active senior singers who go around and put
 
the final polishing touches to the younger groups--little
 
pieces of news  like that which led me to feel that on the whole
 
this tradition is moving along as one would hope it would -
 
-
 
differently in different places,  firmly attached
 
-11-
to its roots but out there in the sunshine too.
 Douglas Seroff
 
put on a highly successful concert at the auditorium in Fisk
 
University -
t year honoring the Fairfield Four quartet,  (and
 
that was a breakthrough event there)  and
 
negotiation with Ladysmith Black Mambazo to put on a joint a
 
capella concert with the Sterling Jubilees Quartet,  since it
 
turns out that the two groups like each other's sound.
 
Well,  plainly,  this is a story that hasn't ended yet.
 But I
 
do think there are a few lessons to be drawn from what we've
 
seen happen so far in this African-American a capella quartet
 
singing business,  ideas that might help shape some future
 
activities.
 I am not going to try to consider why the local
 
community -
-
 black and white -
-
 did not support that original
 
concert.
 It seems possible that certain special unknown norms
 
for successful African-American event organization in Birmingham
 
were not observed, but I don't know for sure.
 I think it is
 
equally possible to predict that the first few times anything is
 
tried, especially in a conservative black community,  it may well
 
not be widely supported -
 not until the word gets around.
 What
 
I can outline for you with some hope for accuracy are a few of
 
the factors that went into the long-range fruitfulness of the
 
concert:
 
-12-
1)
 The musical tradition celebrated had real
 
historical depth and real cultural significance and meaning -
 and
 
it was  intrinsically gorgeous.
 It was  important.
 
2)
 The research into the tradition had been done with
 
great thoroughness and scholarly care,  resulting--among other
 
things--in the logical selection of Birmingham,  Alabama,  a
 
major center in the development of quartet singing,  as the
 
concert site.
 (Other centers could have been chosen,  of course,
 
but this was one of the important ones.
 The concert was not
 
staged in Hollywood,  or Washington,  DC,  or New York City or
 
other more fashionable venues.)
 
3)
 Again,  as the result of intensive research,  the
 
right singers had been invited,  the right ones  in this case being
 
all the groups that had participated in the development of the
 
Birmingham style.
 Not everyone was still alive or could
 
participate,  but all the
 
attempt had been made to
 
included.
 And that made
 
singers present knew that a serious
 
include everybody who should have been
 
for an atmosphere of joyful  relaxation
 
amongst the singers.
 They were having a reunion --who cared
 
about anything else.
 
-13-
4) The actual research was presented back to the researched
 
community in an inexpensive,  profusely illustrated,  interesting,
 
verifiable form.
 It is impossible to look at that program
 
booklet and not be impressed by the extraordinary story of the
 
development of quartet singing in Birmingham.
 The availability
 
of solid pains-taking scholarship has the effect of empowerment
 
to the community studied,  allowing the development of legitimate
 
pride.
 It can form a bridge,  too,  for contact across caste and
 
class lines.
 But it has to be made available,  and that requires
 
major effort.
 
5) And then there was a concert.
 The living singers
 
came together,  and they opened their throats and poured their
 
passion and skill and liveliness and humor out over the empty
 
hail,  and no one who heard them could ever be convinced that
 
this was a dying art.
 I am in favor of books, publications of
 
all kinds, musical transcriptions,  tapes,  records,  films,  but in
 
spite of all the technological and electronic gadgetry in the
 
world,  the primary gestating act of music,  I believe, only
 
happens when musicians and listeners assemble.

 I put the evaluation problem
 
-14-
t
- within a bureacratic context,  and I complained,  in a
 
typical self-pitying bureaucratic way,  about the nonsensicalness
 
of having to work out evaluation methods.
 But evaluation is a
 
real problem and it exists out there in the real world, not just
 
in terms of governmental requirements.
 Evaluation doesn't just
 
happen on paper.
 We may never have to fill in an evaluation
 
form, but the hard fact is that we  do go on evaluating our own
 
and others' work in this field continually.
 
And when I say "we" here I mean everybody -
-
 artists,
 
audiences, everyone who has been touched in any way by the
 
particular event.
 Everyone evaluates -
-
 out loud or in
 
silence.
 And on the basis of those evaluations,  the next event
 
will rise or decline, will grow or shrink, will take place  or
 
f.
 tI
 
We all need to try to become better evaluators,
 
more cogent critics, broader in range, more precise and more
 
understanding.
 Our evaluations are important -
-
 everybody's
 
evaluations are important.
 
One way in which we could improve our evaluations would be
 
to try to remember that cultural events reflect many interests,
 
that these interests may and generally do vary,  that one man's
 
success may be another man's tedium or even disaster.
 We should
 
-15-
try to notice these variances and think very specifically about
 
them.
 Then we could work at breaking down the significant
 
component elements of a cultural event as I just tried to do for
 
you in describing the Birmingham quartet concert;  in that case,
 
you recall,  I pulled out as important variables the nature of
 
the tradition itself,  the location of the event,  the scholarly
 
research effort,  the publication record,  and finally the
 
experience of the artists themseIye .

The Birmingham concert was one highly visible move in a long
 
series of events,  some coming before and some after,  all
 
converging around the central tradition of African-American
 
Black a capella quartet music in all its splendor.
 My deep
 
concern over the lack of attendance resulted from my not taking
 
into consideration the events leading up to the concert and my
 
ignorance of what would happen in future.

 The a

and t

.
 And t
hen t
here was a
 concert. The l
i
ving s
ingers c
ame t
ogether, and
 
t
hey opened t
heir t
hroats and poured t
heir passion and s
kill and l
i
veliness
 
and humor out over t
he empty h
ail, and no one who heard t
hem c
ould e
ver
 
be convinced t
hat t
his was a
 dying a
rt. I
 am i
n f
avor o
f books, publications
 
o
f a
l
l k
inds, musical t
ranscriptions, t
apes, r
ecords, and f
i
lms, but i
n s
pite o
f
 
a
l
l t
he t
echnological and e
lectronic g
adgetry i
n t
he world, t
he p
rimary
 
gestating a
ct o
f music, I
 believe, only h
appens when musicians and l
i
steners
 
a
ssemble.
 
A
t t
he beginning o
f t
his a
rticle I
 put t
he e
valuation p
roblem within a
 
bureaucratic context, and I
 complained, i
n
 a
 t
ypical s
elf-pitying bureaucratic
 
way, about t
he nonsense o
f having t
o work out e
valuation methods. But
 
evaluation i
s
 a
 r
ealproblem and i
t
 exists out t
here i
n t
he r
ealworld, not j
ust
 
i
n t
erms o
f governmental r
equirements. Evaluation doesn't j
ust happen on
 
paper. We may never h
ave t
o f
i
l
l i

orm, but t
he h
ard f
act i
s
 
t
hat we do go on evaluating our own and o
thers' work i
n t
his f
i
eld
 
continually.
 
And when I
 s
ay "we" here I
 mean e
verybody—artists, a
udiences,
 
e
veryone who h
as been t
ouched i

Everyone evaluates, out l

and newspaper publicity, and engaged a
lmost half o
f a
 nearby motel where
 
t
he f
if
ty-odd s

ccommodated. Most o
f t

he general opinion
 
was t
hat a
 c
apella quartet s
inging was dead o
r dying t
hroughout t
he s
outh.
 
I
 c
ame down f
rom Washington f
or t

t was i
n a
 
c
avernous hall built t
o hold perhaps 3
,000 people, f

orest o
f

round

 could s
ee no more t

if
ty people, t
hough I
 
l
a

here were 2

cattered t
hrough t

t
 l
east f

o
f

t
 was hard t

o l
ook, what
 
t

hen t
he f
i

a
l
l duded up i

ull o
f
 
excitement, r
aring t

rabbed f
our microphones a
t r
andom and
 
began t
o s

n t
he power and
 
excitement o
f
 t

rom
 
t
he wings whooping t
hem on, r
unning out t
o g

The audience began t
o cheer up. We c
lapped and s
tamped, t
rying t
o
 
make up i
n
 enthusiasm f
or our small numbers. And t
he quartets kept c
oming,
 
one af

Something about t

s

 kept r

when I

 b

t had meant t
o t
hem.
 
I
 f
lew back t
o Washington and i
n t

f t

 c
losed out t

 would

t

 guess I
 hoped not t

But back i

horough, s

Well, p

 am not going t

 The t

 The r

 Again, a

 The a

 And t
hen t
here was a
 c
oncert. The l
i
ving s

ame t
ogether, and
 
t
hey opened t
heir t
hroats and poured t
heir passion and s
kill and l
i
veliness
 
and humor out over t
he empty hall, and no one who heard t
hem could ever
 
be convinced t
hat t
his was a
 dying a

 am i
n f
avor o
f books, publications
 
o
f a

a
l
l t

n t
he world, t
he p
rimary
 
gestating a
ct o
f music, I
 believe, only happens when musicians and l
i
steners
 
a
ssemble.
 
A
t t
he beginning o
f t
his a
rticle I
 put t
he evaluation p
roblem within a
 
bureaucratic context, and I
 complained, i
n
 a
 t
ypical s
elf-pitying bureaucratic
 
way, about t
he nonsense o
f having t
o work out evaluation methods. But
 
e
valuation i
s
 a

p
roblem and i
t
 exists out t
here i

he hard f
act i

t

And when I
