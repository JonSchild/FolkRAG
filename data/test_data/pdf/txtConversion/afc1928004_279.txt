MR. ROLLIN HOWARD 
Was born in the City of New York, and receiving a 
liberal 
education, was early placed under the tutorship of the finest 
musical masters in America, suc has Clare, W. Beams, Win. A 
King, and other celebrities, as his instructors on the piano-
orte and for theory—and under Madame Valentini ( the in-
structress of Adelina Patti), Signore Errani, and latterly 
finished under Maestro Antonio Paralli, for vocal training. 
He made his appearance in public as a • Boy Soprano" at 
Madame Anna bishop's Concerts, and afterwards travelled 
with Miss Catherine Hayes. 
He in his 18th year debuted 
an actor at the Ailelphi 'theatre, Troy, as ' Francis" in the 
Stranger—and played during that season all the principal 
" 
Eccentric Comedy and Musical" parts. 
Two years after 
he performed in " Lalla.h Itookh," the princi:u1 parts, with 
Mr. and Mrs. W. J. Florence, at Wallack's Theatre, New 
York—he also supported them throughout their Southern 
engagements—returning to New York—he for two seasons 
was a 
great favorite at the Bowery Theatre, New York, 
where he first introduced in America the celebrated songs 
" 
Ever of Thee," " No one to Love," " Hark, I 
hear an An-
gel sing." and m ny others. 
On his retirement from the 
Bowery he was presented with a 
valuable service of silver, 
by prominent citizens of New York City. 
It was at this. 
Theatre the celebrated manager of Wood's Minstruls heard 
him sing and gIve his imitation of Opera Singers, and by 
strong inducements caused him leave the stage and become 
" 
A 
Mins:re21," a 
profession which he has ornamented by the 
original intro(lue`jon of the modern style of 
Furlesque Ope-
ra," and by avritin; composing and singing, some of the most 
popular songs ( vcr heard on the Minstrel stage in America, 
such as • roctztc•-
•il en the Stairs " • Darn. , g 
Little Soplaie," 
" 
The Stcpme:licr," 
Mamma aint I 
Sweet." " Ellie Queen 
of May," 
and his Comic sensations have never been 
.equalled, such as the great and only " Shoo fly, don't bod-
1 
45 
-der me," " Let Me "" " I 
love you," " Good enough," and 
his Songs and Dances are also world renowned, " As we 
parted at the gate," " As she went passing by," " Little 
Belle," " One Sunday Eve at 8," and three hundred other 
compositions too numerous to mention. 
He has success-
fully played long engagements with Dan Bryant's Min-
strels, San Francisco Minstrels, New Yi,rk, and Star en-
gagements with all the other Bands in America ( except 
one.) 
He appeared as Tenore in Engllsh Opera, with the 
American Opera Co., Henry Draper, manager, in " Bohe-
mian Girl," ‘• Maritana," " Fra Diovolo," &e. 
In 1870 Mr. 
Howard, finding there was a 
greater scope for his talent, 
and also a 
larger remuneration—played the most successful 
engagements ever played by any one in his line at the prin-
cipal Variety Theatres of the United States—such as " The 
Union Square Theatre" ( being the only Burlesque Prima 
Donna ever engaged at this Theatre, where he produced 
his " Grand Dutch-us," which had a 
run) Howard Athe-
nmum. Boston, Mass. Fox's American Theatre, PhiladeL 
phia, where he preduced "The Dutch-us," " Lucretia Bor-
gia," and " Hamlet in Black," (all of which had extended 
runs), and so successful was he at the Front Street Thea-
tre, Baltimore, that he was complimented with a 
benefit 
and presented with a " Gold Medal" value one hundred and 
fifty dollars, and this year, 182, he, I 
revious to leaving 
America, was offered the management of Mr. George 
Deagle's Company, the great St. Louis Manager. 
While 
engaged at Wood's Museum, Chicago, Mr. Howard was 
presented with a 
massive gold watch and chain. 
Mr. how-
arch appeared in a 
round of Burksque impersonations at 
Wood's Museum, 1871, with Pauline Mariam, Belle How-
itt, and others— in " Poll and my Partner Joe," " aion," 
" 
Lurline," " Endymion" " Forty 
Thieves," " Eiley 
O'Connor," and others, and was pronounced by the press 
to have made a • decided and genuine hit." 
He was re-
luctantly released, in order to visit England, by Miss Lau-
ra Keene, whom he was engaged to support that season. 
He took his farewell tour during the present summer, and 
was everywhere enthusiastically received, and previous to 
his departure, the entire press of the Metropolis of Ameri-
ca—New York City—paid him the most flattering compli-
ments as an artiste and composer, and for them he is in-
( 
 -401 Ptiow4dmAi. 
debted to The Sew York herald, The Sew York Clipper. 
Sew York Sunday Xercury, Sew York Dispatch, Sew York 
Sunday Times, The Stage, Evening Telegram, The Sun, 
Dramatic News, & c. & c. 
He departed for Europe, per 
Steamship 
Egypt, August 10th, 1872, and on his arri-
val at Liverpool, was most cordially received by the 
profession ingeneral, and received from The Courier and 
Express very flattering welcome notices. 
He made his 
first appearance in England at '• The Londesborough The-
atre," Scarborough, performing " Howard at Home," (lu-
ring which his " Greeting to England was enthusiastically 
applauded, after this Act he received two recalls, and in 
"Little Fraud," being recalled for his Tyrolean Song, and 
at the end of this Act ha concluded with " Any Port in a 
Storm," in which he successfully sang " Come into the 
garden. Maud," and his imitation of Mile. Nilsson, which 
was encored. 
On his return to Liverpool, Mr. Rodin How-
ard appeared with great success for four months. 
He also 
met with great success in Ireland, during his visit there. 
He then visited the British i rovinces, and everywhere met 
with a 
flattering welcome. 
His success in London was so 
great that instead of remaining four weeks ( for which time 
he was orig:nally engaged). ho remained eleven months, 
with unabated success, and was engaged still further 
ahead, but was compelled to visit America owing to family 
afflictions, thus stopping a 
brilliant success, unexcelled by 
any American Artiste. 
He made his last appearance in 
England, at Brighton, on which occasion the stage was 
strewn with flowers, and Mr. II. received many valuable 
presents at parting, from friends and a 
public that had treat-
ed him with kindnesses never to be erased from memory. 
He returned to America after a 
tempestuous voyage of six-
teen days, on the S. S. Egypt, being two days in the Ty-
phoon that the " Villa du Harve" was lost in. 
Too high 
praise cannot be paid Capt. Grogan, for his masterly con-
duct of the Egypt, and in honor of him Mr. Howard has 
named one of the characters in his play of "Boffle.d." On 
Mr. Howard's arrival, manager Geo. Wood, of Wood's Mu-
seum, readily secured his services as Star, where he ap-
peared for two weeks, in February, 1875. 
Mr. Howard 
has since been starring throughout the U. S., in his new 
plays of " Baffled," • Charlotte Ternp'e." " The Stubborn Ju-
ror." 
This season 1875 and ' 76, Mr. Howard travels as 
" 
Star" with Mr. W. II. Lannier's Company. and also plays 
engagements at different Theatres, in the principal Cities 
of the United States and Canadas.

;.a 
Rollin Howard's " Gem" Medley. 
Introducing his famous 
You'll never miss the Water 't11,1 
the Well runs Dry "—As sung by him in his 
great play entitled " BAFFLED." 
There's a 
letter in the candle, 
It points direct to me ; 
How the little spark is shining ; 
From whomever can it be ? 
It gets brighter still, and brighter, 
Like a 
little sunny ray; 
And I 
dare to guess the writer, 
For it drives suspense away. 
Bright spark of hope, 
Shed your beams on me, 
And send a 
loving message 
From far across the sea, 
Bright spark of hope. 
Shed your beams on me, 
And send a 
loving message—From— 
The little log cabin in the lane! 
Al! yes, I 
am old and feeble now, my 
head is bending low, 
And I 
never more shall hoe the corn again! 
Yet the Angels they will lead me, when my time has come t0 
Dance in the dreamy waltz, 
Beautiful, sweet and dreamy waltz, 
As round and round 
To sweet languid strains we whirl; 
Dancing in the dreamy waltz, 
l'eautiful, sweet and dreamy waltz ; 
Oh I 
the joys of dancing, 
In the dreamy waltz! 
Then there is no harm in kissing, 
Pray tell me, is there dear ? 
Those rosy lips invite me now, 
And no one lingers near! 
Then loving ones are meeting— 
No prying eyes to mark— 
There is no harm in kissing, 
At twilight in the Park !— 
But—Wait ' till the moonlight falls on the water, 
Then take your sweetheart out for a 
walk ; 
Mind what you say, boys ; that's how to court her ; 
Tell het that you will wed her when the days grow short. 
Then she'll say—Oh ! aint you awful ! 
It's wrong you know to teaze me so; 
Oh! aint you horrid, 
You naughty, wicked man! 
As we sat by the river, you and I, 
In the sweet summer time, long ago, 
So smoothly the water glided by. 
Mak.ng music in its tranquil flow. 
We threw two leaflets, you and I, 
To the river, as it wandered on ; 
And one was rent and left to die, 
knd the other floated forward all alone, 
And, oh! we were sadden'd, you and I, 
For we felt that our youth's golden dream 
Might fade, and our lives be sever'd, soon 
As the two leaves were parted—As— 
The birds sleeping gently, 
Sweet Lyra g,leameth bright; 
Her rays tinge the forest, 
And all seems glad to-night ; 
The wind's sighing by me, 
Cooling my feverish brow ; 
The stream flows as ever, 
let. Alice, where art thou? 
One year back, this even, 
And thou wert by my side 
Vowing to love me. 
One year past, this even, 
And thou wert by my side— 
Vowing to -- Love me once again, 
Meet me once aga'n ; 
Old love is waiting, shall it 
nit in vain ? 
When a 
child. I 
liv'd at Lincoln with my parents on the 
farm, 
The lessons that my mother taught to me were quite a 
charm ; 
She would often take me on her knee, when tired of child-
ish play, 
And as she pressed me to her breast, I've heard my mother 
say :— 
Waste not, want not, is a 
maxim I 
would teach, 
Let your watchword be, dispatch, and practice what you 
preach; 
Do not let your chances, like sunbeams, pass you by, 
For, " You never miss the water 'till the wall runs dry r 
Is sung by Mr. Rot= HowAr.o. in his unequaled rendi-
tion of " St. Clair," in that famous Drama, 
throughout America. 
" 
ST. CLAIR TO EVA." 
Childless, desolate this heart, 
Naught on earth is left to cherish, 
Every hop and joy must part— 
Every hope and joy will perish. 
Eva, Eva ! charming daughter, 
SmIlo, upon me from above ; 
Open wide those gates of pearl, 
Bless me with thy Heavenly love ; 
Art thou gone from me forever ? 
Shall I 
nevermore behold thee ? 
Oh ! my heart and soul's affection, 
What is now this world to me? 
Home is silent, dread and drear, 
Uncle Tom is seen to weep ; 
Topsy lingers near thy bier, 
Strewing roses at thy feet. 
Eva, Eva ! lovely daughter, 
Are those sweet lips closed and cold, 
That so gently spoke of Heaven, 
Emblem of an Angel's mould? 
Angel of divine perfection, 
Loved by all, enslaved and free; 
Oh! my heart and soul's affection, 
What is now this world to me? 
Sung in " Uncle Tom's Cabin," by -

With golden hair so lovely, 
And eyes of softest blue, 
That say, in looks so heavenly, 
Mamma, I 
so love you. 
Our darling little treasure, 
With footsteps light and fleet, 
With pleading tone comes asking, 
Dear Mamma, aint I 
sweet? 
Cuottus. 
Rosy little cherub, 
With hair of golden hue, 
Ah ! you know not, my darling. 
How well Mamma loves you. 
The first thing in the morning. 
That voice so soft and sweet, 
Comes, its little song a 
singing, 
its Mamma, dear. to greet. 
And at the hour of evening 
Its evening prayer '11 repeat--
But ever, before its sleeping, 
Says—Mamma, aint I 
sweet? 
Rosy little cherub, &c. 
FAREWELL! 
Sung by ROLLIN HOWARD, in the character of 
PERCY DE 
VEEE," in his great play of " BAFFLED." 
Look me in the face, dear, openly and free, 
Put thy hand in mine dear— 
Have no fear of me ; 
So, like friends, old loves should part, 
Each one with a 
quiet heart. 
Oh, farewell! we now must part, dear Susie ; 
Sad you wander, far from me ; 
Oh, farewell! nor time, nor thought, can ever 
Turn my heart, my loving heart from thee. 
Farewell! we part to meet again ; 
Farewell, Farewell! Oh! Fare-thee-well! 
Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1815, by A. J. 
FIfifIER, in the office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington. 
The best ballad in the English language, composed and 
sung by ROLLIN HOWARD, in his impersonation 
of "4130= 7" 
in the great play of " BAFFLED." 
The marriage rite is over, 
And though I 
turn aside 
To keep the guests from seeing 
The tears I 
could not hide, 
I 
wreath my face in smiling, 
And led my little brother 
To greet my father's chosen— 
But I 
could not call her mother 
She is a 
fair young creature 
With meek and'gentle air, 
With blue eyes, soft and loving, 
And silken, sunny hair. 
I 
know my father gives her 
The love he bore another ; 
But if she were an Angel 
I 
could never call her mother. 
Last night I 
heard her singing 
A 
song I 
used to love, 
When its sweet tones were uttered 
By her who sings above ; 
It pained my heart to hear it, 
And the tears I 
could not smother, 
For every word was hallowed 
By the dear voice of my mother. 
My father, in the sunshine 
Of happy days to come, 
May half forget that shadow 
That darkened our old hom. , ; 
His heart no more is lonely, 
But me and little biother 
Must still be orphan children— 
God can give us but one mother. 
They've ta'en my mother's pictur., 
From its accustomed place, 
And placed beside my father's 
A 
younger, fairer face ; 
They've changed her dear old chambt. 
To the boudoir of another ; 
But I 
will ne'er for:rt thee, 
My own, my Ang ,
.-1 mother. 
Sung by ROLLIN HOWARD, in his celebrated character of 
" 
Capt. Montraville," in his emotional play of 
CHARLOTTE TEMPLE. 
Yes, let me like a 
soldier fall. 
Upon some open plain; 
This breast expanding for the ball, 
To blot out every stain ; 
Brave, manly hearts, confer my doom, 
That gentler ones may tell, 
Howe'er forgot, unknown my tomb, 
I 
like a 
soldli r 
fell. 
I 
only ask of that proud race 
Which ends its blaze in me, 
To we the last, and not disgrace 
Its ancient chivalry ; 
Though o'er my grave no banner wave— 
That gentler one:; may tell, 
Howe'er forgot, unknown may tomb, 
I 
like a 
soldier fell.

There's a 
handsome young lover in town that I 
know, 
He's the prettiest fellow I 
know for a 
beau ; 
But he falls in love with each face that he sees, 
And that, if I

love him ' tis true, but what can I 
say, 
If his love for another comes into my way? 
I'll be angry enough to tear out his eyes, 
And all 1113 good looks I 
shall surely despise. 
Well, I'll give him a 
trial and if he don't mend, 
As I, such a 
Tartar, he never could find ; 
I'll give him soft word; . ,.
nd love's sweetest smile, 
And try with love's arts all his hours to beguile; 
And then should another e'en date to intrude, 
'Round his ears such a 
tempest will gather, so rude, 
He'll declare, since the world by a 
deluge was drown'd. 
Like me, not another on earth could be found.

HOWARD —You've written " Shoo fly," and " Let Me Be" two of 
the greatest sensation songs ever known; call your nest one " Good 
Enough," after Inv old saying. and with your music it will be good 
enough for anybody.—Era. HORN. 
Hannah—I'm " good enough" this very day, 
And happy as can be, 
The " Sunflower,' or the " Hollyhock" 
Cannot come up to me. 
Pete—That's so, for now you suit my style, 
You're gay as you can be ; 
What's good enough for Hannah, girls, 
Is good enough for me.

Just see that hair how tight it curb, 
She's good enough for me. 
Mitnnah—The whole thing works so strangely, boys, 
That very much I 
fear 
Unless I 
now own I 
love him, 
He'll " Slip off on his ear." 
Pete—Oh, never fear my darling one, 
For wedded we will be 
In " The little church ' round the corner." 
That's good enough for me. [Chorus.. 
UNCLE TOM'S RELIGION 
Far away from wife and children, 
Still I 
plod my way along, 
Massa Clare has gone to Eva, 
Leaving friendless poor old Tom ! 
Yet, with trust and strength in Heaven, 
I 
remain a 
faithful slave ; 
When de whip to me am gihen, 
I'll think of Him who died to save! 
Shall I 
turn against my brother, 
Raise the hand of cruelty? 
No ! we must love one another, 
Den we'll get where all am free. 
Patience here I'll go to glory, 
There is comfort for the slave ; 
When de lash makes dis flesh gory, 
I'll pray to him who died to save. 
Good bye, Chloe, farewell children, 
Poor old Tom you'll see no more; 
Mind, be good and hab religion, 
'Twill bear you to the faithful shore. 
Do not weep nor feel dejection, 
Suffering's over in the grave; 
But at the glorious resurrection, 
We'll meet with Him who died to save.:

Oh, 'tis sad to bid good-by to all that was so dear,

Oh! can it be, innocent maiden, 
Thou kuowest not the meaning of love' 
When Nature with passion is laden, 
From gray earth to bright sky above ? 
What softens the dar1i. rugged mountain ? 
What daintily ' tireth the corn ? 
What peoples with Naiads the fountain, 
And perfumes the zephyrs of morn? 
Ah! It is love! the spirit of beauty! 
Whose home is the innocent heart 
Where to lodge him is but a 
duty, 
Nor thence let him ever depart. 
And lo, now the gentle dove wooing, 
A 
mate to his desolate nest, 
She turns not away from his cooing, 
Nor ruffles her snowy white breast. 
And why dost thou deign now I 
o 
hear 
Where shading boughs intertwine, 
And why dost thou linger still near me, 
And why slips thy hand into mine?

It is love, the spirit of beauty, 
Whose home is the innocent heart ; 
Where, to lodge him, is but a 
duty— 
Nor thence let him ever depart.

After summer came December, 
Roses perished in the snow; 
While I

WANDERED BY THE BROOKSIDE 
Music Published by FIRTH, POND Sz Co., 547 Broadway, New York 
I 
wandered by the brook-side, 
I 
wandered by the mill— 
I 
could not hear the brook flow, 
The noisy wheel was still. 
There was no soun, of grasshopper, 
No chirp of any bird-
1-ind the beating of my own heart 
Was all the sound I 
heard, 
I 
sat beneath the Elm tree, 
I 
watched the long, long shade, 
And as it grew still longer, 
I 
did not feel afraid— 
For I 
listened for a 
footfall, 
I 
listened for a 
word, 
But the beating of my own heart, 
Was all the sound I 
heard. 
He came not, no, he came not! 
The moon came out alone ; 
The little stars sat, one by one, 
Each on its golden throne. 
The evening wind passed by my cheek, 
The leaves above were stirred, 
But the beating of my own heart 
Was all the sound I 
heard. 
Fast, silent tears were falling, 
When something stood behind, 
A 
hand was on my shoulder, 
I 
knew the touch was kind; 
It drew me nearer, nearer, 
We could not speak a 
word, 
And the beating of own hearts 
Was all the sound we heard.

And the busy days are long, 
And the nights are lonely now 
For you are gone from our little cottage home. 
Below us in the valley, on the Santee's,' dancing tide, 
Of a 
Summer eve I'd launch my open boat ; 
And when the moon was rising and the stars began to shine, 
Down the river we so merrily would float. 
Oh, I 
miss you, &c. 
One sunny morn in Autumn, ere the dew had left the lawn 
Came a 
trader up from Louisiana bay ; 
Who gave to master money, and then shackl'd her with 
chains. 
And then he took her off t.o work her life away. 
Oh, I 
miss you, S:c. 
Since that time the world is dreary, and I 
long from earth 
to rise, 
— 
And join the happy angels gone before, 
I 
never can be merry, for my heart is full of woe, 
And I'm pining for my pretty Nettie Moore. 
Oh, I 
miss you, 
You are gone, lovely Nettie, and my heart must surely' 
break, 
'When the tears come no more into my eyes ; 
But when weary life is past, I 
shall meet you once again, 
In Heaven, darling, up above the skies. 
Oh, I 
miss you, &e.

MULCAHY'S GONE AWAY. 
Entered according to Act of Congress in the year 1874 by E. H. 
H ARDING, in the office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington. 
Words and Music by Joseph P. SKELT,Y. 
The Music of this song is published by E. H HARDING, 288 Bowery, 
New York. 
Price 10 cents. 
As sung by JOELNNY ROACH, the Irish Comic, and DR. JAS. 
L. 
THAYER, the greatest Clown of the Northwest. 
The Hero of my humble song 
Was once a 
mighty man. 
A 
shining light in his neighborhood, 
And chief of all his clan ; 
But when he found in course of time 
The tricks his friends did play, 
Sure he left them all, and now they cry, 
Mulcahy's gone away! 
CHORUS. 
He was great and grand, and took command 
Of the boys on Patrick's day ; 
But now the cry is everywhere, 
Mulcahy's gone away! 
He won our pride and won our praise, 
And he deserved it too ! 
Sure many a 
time tor nights and days 
We stuck to him like glue; 
Be held an office of the State, 
And faith he made it pay; 
But for such a 
place he was too great, 
And nos- he's gone away! 
He was great, Ss 
The politicians worshipped him, 
And swore he'd yet be Mayor; 
And tho' the chance looked rather dim, 
He thought it bright and fair; 
But ere he came to rule the town, 
His mind was led astray, 
And now the cry is everywhere, 
Mulcahy's gone away! 
He was great, 
He was as sound a 
Democrat 
As ever filled a 
chair, 
But he lost his great position, 
And it drove him to despair; 
We know not where to seek for him; 
He must have crossed the say ; 
0, it grieves us just to think of it— 
Mulcahy's gone away! 
He was great, &*. 
He treated us like gintlemen 
Whenever we did meet; 
The sight of him would do you good, 
From his head down to his feet ; 
He wore a 
collar stiff and high, 
Which made a 
great display; 
He was a 
most distinguished ruan--., 
But now he's gone away! 
He was great, &c. 
The girls went crazy when he winked, 
And many an artful plan 
They put in operation for 
To catch this darlin' man ; 
But now they're left alone, poor things; 
They weep and wail, and say— 
Oh, what'll we do at all? 
Mulcahy's gone away! 
He was great, etc.

As sung by TONY PASTOR.: 
DID you ever make love ? If not, have a 
try, 
I 
courted a 
girl once, so bashful and shy, 
A 
fair little creature who by the by, 
At coaxing and wheedling had such a 
nice way; 
Ev'ry night to her house I 
went, 
In harmless delight our evenings were spent, 
She had a 
queer saying, whatever it meant, 
For whenever I 
entered her house she would say : 
CHORUS. 
Pull down the blind, pull down the blind, 
Pull down the blind, love, come don't be unkind. 
Though we're alone, bear this in mind, 
Somebody's looking, love, pull down the blind. 
How loving we were, how cosy we'd chat, 
'Bout one thing and Cother, and this thing and that, 
With my arm round her waist, how cosy we sat, 
Like two little turtle- doves perched on a 
tree; 
Such squeezing and teasing and pleasing we had— 
Such wooing and cooing to make our hearts glad, 
With laughing and chaffing I 
near drove her mad; 
But still she was awfully spooney on me. 
SPOKEN. — And if that soldier would only have left us alone, 
she would never have exclaimed: 
Pull down the blind, etc. 
One night, for a 
change, we went to the play, 
And when we got home she was awfully gay, 
ghe saw them make love, and so learned the way, 
The piece was " Claude Melnotte," and suited her tine; 
She called me her rose- bud, her duck, and her dear, 
She threw her arms round me, while fast fell each tear; 
She cried, oh, don't leave me, for sadly I 
fear 
You don't love me truly, say, will you be mine? 
SPOKEN,— Just at that moment a 
policeman passed, and she 
said: 
Pull down the blind, etc. 
Our courting days o'er, at last we were wed, 
I 
oft bless the hour when to church her I 
led, 
I 
now call her Mary, she calls me Ned, 
We're happy and loving, and never know strife; 
We've a 
fine handsome lass, and two noble boys, 
Trouble or sorrow, never us annoys; 
Of life we've the sweets, and while tasting its joys, 
I'm thankful I'm blessed with a 
good little wife. 
SPOKEN.—And should an angry word rise to my lips, with a 
meek smile on her face she'll exclaim: 
"LITTLE BELLE" THE RUSTIC BEAUTY.

TRA-LA-LA GEORGE! 
As sung by ALICE HARRISON. 
Words and Music by Jos. P. SKELLEY. Music I
CP be had of E. EL. 
HARDING, 229 Bowery, N.Y. 
My love is young, and fair, and sweet, 
My fancy she can please, 
But 0, she is inclined to flirt 
With every one she sees; 
Whenever she goes out alone, 
She's sure to catch a 
beau, 
But then she says it's all for fun, 
And that's no harm you know! 
I 
want her to be mine, 
And oft I 
tell her so, 
But tho' she don't decline, 
She won't say yes or no. 
CHORUS. 
Tra-la-li, George, Tra-la-la, George, 
You must go and ask Papa, George. 
Tra-la-li, George, Tra-la-la, George, 
You must go and ask Pa-pa, Ha, ha, pa. 
One day she'll smile, the next she'll frown, 
She is a 
creature strange, 
But these is no one in this town, 
For whom I 
would exchange; 
She's like the rest of woman kind, 
A 
riddle hard to read,— 
I'd like to know just what she means, 
'Twould please me much indeed ! 
I 
want her to be mine, 
To Me she is most dear, 
But, tho she don't decline, 
Her answer pains my ear. 
Tra-la-li, George, &x. 
Her father's a 
gruff old man, 
With lots"of wordly pelf,— 
He says his charming daughter 
Is a 
fortune in herself; 
In that, of course, we both agree, 
But when I 
speak about 
her hand and heart, we have to part, 
For he cooly kicks me out! 
I 
see my love each day, 
She says it is a 
shame, 
What will we do ?—I 
say— 
Her answer is the same. 
CHORUS. 
Tra-la-li, George, Tra-la-la, George, 
You must go and ask Papa, George.

'Tis sweet on the sea side to wanner 
With the darling who gain'd your first love, 
Or alone o'er his kind words to ponder, 
As with joy you his constancy prove; 
But if pleasure you would be receiving, 
A

feelin ,
:; entrancing, 
You gaze on your partner with pride ; 
Ton dream of his. future, when dancing, 
How to glory he proudly would ide, 
As fondly your waist he is pressing, 
And a 
glance from his bright eye you get, 
You think to yourse,f, what a 
blessing, 
To waltz with a 
West Point Cadet ; 
You think to yourself what a 
blessing, 
To waltz with a 
West Point Cadet. 
You see him in fancy preparing 
To march as a 
Warrior so brave, 
For his life in the battle not caring, 
That his country's bright banner may wave 
In glory and triumph above him; 
To rout the brave foe he has met ; 
You wake from your dream but to love him, 
That noble young West Point Cadet. 
You wake from your dream but to love him, 
That noble West Point Cadet. 
As around, &c. 
Some years have passed by since that morning 
When I 
and that loved one did meet, 
But the memory oft is returning, 
How together our young hearts did beat. 
I 
have oft in the dance trod a 
measure, 
But the night I 
shall never forget, 
It is stored in my heart like a 
treasure, 
That waltz with the West Point Cadet, 
It is stored in my heart like a 
treasure, 
That dance with a 
IVest Point Cadet.

Happy was I; 
Oh! take me to my kind old mudder,

When will I

Down in my good old home?

As she trips along always singing that song, 
Just as happy as a

DOWN by a 
little running brook, 
Where bel-ries .sweetest grow, 
There lives the only girl I 
love, 
Miss ' Liza Jane my beau. 
'Twas in among de bushes, 
De first time I 
espied her; 
She cried aloud, oh darkey come, 
And pull out dis yer briar. 
CHORUS. 
Oh darkey don't you linger der, 
Lord, I 
shall expire, 
Come help dis bleeding finger, 
And subtract away the briar. ( Repeat.) 
I 
grabbed this fainting fair one, 
Right by her little thump, 
Ind pulled the thorney 
out 
Like ' possum from the 
more I 
kissed the tinier, 
Do more it seemed to heal, 
And when I 
kissed her two lips, on, 
How happy she did feel. 
Oh, darkey, 
I 
courted sweet Miss ' Liza Jane, 
And well I 
played my part, 
I 
says subtract de briar out 
Dat's sticking in my- heart;

Wid hymen's knot to tie her.

Since widont a

LOTTE TEMPLE, joyed with her in her early pleasures, sym-
pathized and wept with her in her sorrows, and glowed 
with indignation at the wrongs which she suffered from 
base, calculating villains, an opportunity is afforded of 
reading one of the most absorbing works ever written, 
proving " truth stranger than fiction." 
The poet's lines are but a 
just description of the unfor-
tunate Charlotte Temple: 
Her form was faultless, and her mind, 
Untainted yet by art, 
Was noble, just, humane and kind, 
And virtue warmed her heart. 
But, ah! the cruel spoiler came—" 
This book, in the language of Mrs. Rowsou, " affords a 
striking example that vice, however prosperous in the be-
tinning, in the end leads only to misery and shame."

THE DAUGHTER OF CHARLOTTE TEMPLE. 
www 
No one who has read the touching account of the 
misfortunes of Charlotte Temple, with that absorb-
ing interest which is inseparable from Mrs. Row-
son's writings, can rest satisfied while denying them-
selves a 
perusal of the life of Charlotte Temple's 
Daughter, Lucy 'Tenapis..-. 
It is a 
sequel possessed of all the thrilling in-
terest that characterizes the life of the unfortunate 
mother, while it exemplifies in a 
wonderful manner 
" 
the visitation of the sins of the parents upon the 
children." 
It depicts sorrows that refuse the balm of sym-
pathy, and consolations which those around us 
" 
can neither give nor take away." 
It contrasts in 
living colors the richest, fruits of virtue and happi-
ness on the one hand, and the bitter end, blighting 
disappointments and ruir resulting from once yieki-
ing to the seductive influence of passion. 
It points a 
moral that commends it to the atten-
tion of all, and is pervaded by an interest that will 
hold the reader in rapt attention to the end.

'LAZE 
First Book for Mechanics, Machinists& Engineers 
By OLIVER BYRNE. 
12mo., cloth. $ 1.50. 
ENDORSEMENTS OF THE PRESS. 
The highest praise which can be given to this excellent 
elementary work on practical mechanics, consists in the fol-
lowing simple statement of facts : The editor of this journal, 
while teaching natural philosophy and chemistry in the 
Cooper Institute from 1859 to 1864, was in need of a 
text-
boo. of practical mechanics, adapted to the advanced classes 
who had been trained in mathematics; in his search among 
the many mechanical text- books, there was not one which so 
fully answered his requirements as the above work. 
It was 
therefore adopted and used with perfect satisfaction, and it 
is with pleasure that he receives it now as an old friend from 
the publishers, gives it his most eit-nest recommendation, 
and wishes it in the hands of all who are still in the fog about 
the units of work, calculation of the power of machinery, 
rek,istance to motion, strain on material, etc.—Manufacturer 
and Builder, July, 1874. 
jrhe author of this work is well known as an extensive 
winter who has rnade sonic valuable additions to American 
technical literature, enumerated above in detail. 
The work 
we are now noticing is a 
theoretical treatise on practical me-
chanics, designed to supply a 
r': cognized deficiency. 
Most 
of the works on mechanics tre‘,:; the subject in a manner 
which is not avaitable to young men commencing as appren-
tices in shops. 
Any young man with a 
fair knowledge of 
arithmetic may, however, use this work to great tni vantage ; 
it is not only suitable for a 
text-book, but also as a wcak 
of reference. 
Most ambitions young men will make them-
selves so familiar with its contents as to be able to Icier 
readily to any prtion of the book. 
The author has adopted 
a 
new notation to distinguish units of work from other units, 
which is not without vain, and might be advantageously 
introlneed into more ambitious works. 
Tha book is well 
printed on good white pal ,er, and bound in slit: cloth coven.
