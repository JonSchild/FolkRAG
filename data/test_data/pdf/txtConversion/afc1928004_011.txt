0, mother dear, I 
sigh in vain 
To live my childhood o'er again, 
To see thy clear love-beaming eye, 
Outshine the stars up in the sky. 
0, mother, bright sunny rays, 
That gives such joy and heavenly bliss, 
As by thy knee I 
used to pray, 
Or climb to steal affection's kiss. 
Chorus- 0, mother dear, I 
sigh in vain, 
To live my childhood o'er again, 
To see thy clear, love-beaming eye, 
Outshine the stars up in the sky. 
0 
mother dear, those early scenes, 
The flowery fields, and meadows green, 
As thoughts come back, I 
heave a 
sigh, 
Andowish for happy days gone by; 
Although I 
left my native shore, 
Yet my heart beats now as then; 
Though miles of sea between us roar, 
Dear mother, I'll come home again, 
Chorus — 0, mother dear, 8,:c. 
NATURAL ANXIETY.—A youth standing by whilst his father 
was gambling, observing him to lose a 
deal of money, burst into 
tears. 
His father asked him why he wept. " Oh, father," re-
plied the youth, " I 
have been told that Alexander the Great wept 
when he heard his father had conquered a 
great many towns, 
cities, and countries, fearing he would leave him nothing to win; 
but I 
weep the contrary way, fearing you will leave me nothing to 
lose."

LINA MAY. 
COMPOSED BY FRED WILSON. 
Published by Gilmore & Russell, Court St. 
Now throw a 
log upon the fire, 
Then darkies draw your chairs, 
And listen to a 
tale of woe 
That's made me sad for years; 
While working at old massa's farm, 
'Twas on a 
summer's day, 
I 
saw a 
lovely colored girl, 
They call'd her Lina May. 
Chorus — Now, darkey, lay the banjo down, 
And there let it remain, 
For I'm too old and feeble, now, 
To strike the chord again. 
'Twas love that beamed in those dark eyes, 
And faultless was her form, 
Her voice was sweeter than the birds, 
That warbled in the morn; 
We often met when sun was down, 
Then I 
would sing and play, 
And sit beside the pine-knot fire, 
Along with Lina May. 
Chorus— Now, darkey, lay the banjo down, & c. 
Our wedding day came 'round at last, 
And happy pass'd the time, 
'Till massa died, and I 
was sent 
Into another clime; 
Then sorrow fill'd her pure young heart, 
She droop'd and pined away; 
So, darkies, now I've told you how, 
I 
lost poor Lina May. 
Chorus — Now, darkey, lay the banjo down, &c. 
What smells most in a 
chemist's shop ?—The nose.

THE DARKEY SOLDIER. 
COMPOSED BY FRED WILSON. 
Sung by Billy Morris, the great and popular Comedian and Tanzborinist. 
I've often heard the white folks talk 
About de niggers in New York— 
And that the soldiers I've heard say, 
Go marching up and down Broad.way-; 
There's darkey Sam that opens clams, 
And carries the target on his back, 
They beat the drum, he steps along, 
He likes to hear de muskets crack. 
Chorus — This darkey soldier am content, 
To fly his kite, and let her went, 
While it is up in de sky, 
Shout, " Yankee doodle dandy." 
Now, darkey Sam was fond ob gin, 
He drank so much his head did swim, 
0, then he took both sides de street, 
For de nigger's heels stuck out a 
feet; 
But, strange to tell, there came a 
smell, 
Out of a 
rum- shop just close by, 
With good intent, ole Sambo went, 
For a 
glass of whiskey on de sly. 
Chorus — This darkey soldier, & c. 
He got de liquor in his hand, 
The darkey then could hardly stand, 
To find his mouth, he next did try, 
Instead, he popped it in his eye. 
When he was found, ' twas on de ground, 
Policeman had him by de hair, 
For getting tight that very night, 
Was fined a 
dollar before the Mayor. 
Chorus — This darkey soldier, & c.

I'm goire to sing a 
little song, 
I'll try and not detain you long, 
It's all about my charming Sal,

nice young gal; 
Her mother lives in tin pot alley, 
The boys all call her charming Sally, 
Be our delight she always shall, 
For she is such a 
nice young gal. 
Chorus— 0, for rollicking fun and glee, 
I 
never saw a 
gal like she, 
And with the boys she goes pell-mell, 
For she is such a 
nice young gal. 
Each morning Sal makes it a 
rule, 
To have five cents to take to school, 
And if her mother won't tip up, 
To the common away she cuts; 
She sports away there all the day, 
And with the boys at marbles play, 
She sails a 
boat and flies a 
kite, 
And don't go home ' till it is night. 
Chorus— 0, for rollicking, & c. 
So, now white folks, I 
hope that you, 
Will give her all the praise that's due, 
Mark her behavior and her face, 
And just get her a 
tidy place; 
Try her for a 
month or two, 
You'll see, then, what the gal can do, 
She'll make your beds,—can wash and scrub, 
For a 
dollar a 
week, and all her grub. 
Chorus— 0, for rollicking fun and glee. 
What tree is an offensive gossip ?—The medlar.

And when the time of death draws near, 
(For all are born to die,) 
We'll meet again in heaven above, 
With angels up on high.

WHEN I SAW SWEET NEL Y HOME. 
9 
Sung by Mr. D. P. TVambold, the popular Balladist, with ltlorris 
Bros., Pell Is' 
nowbridge's Minstrels. 
In the sky, the bright stars glittered, 
On the grass the moonlight fell, 
Hushed the sound of daylight bustle, 
Closed the pink- eyed pimpernel; 
As clown the moss-grown wood-path, 
Where the cattle love to roam, 
From Aunt Dinah's quilting party, 
I 
was seeing Nelly home. 
Chorus — In the sky the bright stars glittered, 
On the grass the moonlight shone, 
From Aunt Dinah's quilting party, 
I 
was seeing .Nelly home. 
When the autumn tinged the greenwood, 
Turning all it's leaves to gold; 
In the lawn by elders shaded, 
I 
my love to Nelly told. 
As we stood, together gazing, 
On the star bespangled dome, 
how I 
bless'd the August evening, 
When I 
saw sweet Nelly home. 
Chorus — In the sky the bright stars glittered, & c. 
White hairs mingled with my tresses, 
Furrows steal upon my brow; 
But a 
love- smile cheers and blesses, 
Life's declining moments now; 
Matron in the snowy ' kerchief, 
Closer to my bosom, come; 
Tell me, cost thou still remember, 
When I 
saw sweet Nelly home. 
Chorus — In the sky the bright stars glittered, &c. 
Why is an ill-made coach- wheel like a gang of blackguards 
playing at cards ?—Because it is composed of a 
circle of bad 
fellows,—very rough spoken, and a 
knave in the centre.

GOOD-BYE, LITTLE MAY.

Sung by Ambrose A. Thayer, the beautiful Balladist, of Morris 
Bros., Pell 
Trowbridge's Minstrels. 
I've lost my little May, at last, 
She perished in the spring; 
When earliest flowers began to bloom, 
And earliest birds to sing; 
I 
laid her in her lowly grave, 
And rural soft retreat; 
A marble tablet at her head, 
And violets at her feet. 
Chorus— Good-bye, little May, 
Good-bye little May, 
Farewell, little May, 
Thou art sleeping far away. 
I 
would that she'd come back again, 
In all her childish glee; 
My joy and hope have followed her, 
My heart is in the grave; 
I 
know that she has gone away, 
I 
know that she has fled, 
I 
miss her every where, and yet, 
I 
cannot think she's dead. 
Chorus— Good-bye, little May, &c. 
I 
miss her with her toys, 
Beside my desk in silent play; 
And then I 
turn, and look for her, 
But she has flown away; 
She come and climbed my chair, 
And peep my shoulders o'er, 
I 
hear a 
spirit laugh, but no, 
She cometh never more. 
Chorus — Good-bye, little May, &c. 
Why is a 
black man like an outcast ?—Because he is out of 
the pale of Society.

When I

To play the royal folks a

I

On this old banjo, I

When the wind is still, I 
chase the coon, 
Through the pine-woods, by the clear, bright moon; 
When day's work is over, the darkeys all wander, 
Down in de woods, with banjo and bones, 
What cares have I

I 
want nothing more than those sweet d.ulcit tones.

Where the big, bright stars, shine brightly on high,

I 'm listening to the whipporwilrs song;

Compared to the log-hut where I

Coax CHECKS.—A well authenticated story has been told of a 
certain vicar, who, several years ago, lived at a 
few miles from 
Loughborough. He was rather eccentric, and not easily imposed 
upon. 
On a 
particular occasion he and several of the principal 
inhabitants dined together at one of the inns in the village; and 
one of the company, thinking that the affair would not be remun-
erative to the landlord, suggested that he might charge an extra 
bottle of wine or two on the bill, by way of making it up. 
That," said the landlord, “ might be done," but the vicar put 
every cork in his pocket, as a 
check to the account!

NEAR THE BANKS OF THAT LONE RIVER. 
Sung by Mr. I). S. Wambold, the popular Balladist, with Morris Bros., 
Pell Ss Trowbridge's Minstrels. 
Near the banks of that lone river, 
Where the water-lilies grow, 
Breathed the fairest flower that ever 
Bloomed and faded, years ago. 
How we met, and loved and parted, 
None on earth, can ever know, 
And how pure and gentle hearted, 
Beamed the mourned one, years ago. 
Chorus— Near the banks of that lone river, 
Where the water-lilies grow, 
Breathed the fairest flower that evero 
Bloomed and faded years ago. 
Like the stream, with lilies laden, 
Will life's future current flow, 
'Till in heaven I ' 11 meet thee, maiden, 
Fondly cherished, years ago; 
Hearts that loved like mine, forget not, 
They ' re the same in weal or woe; 
And the stars of memory set not, 
In the grave of years ago. 
Chorus — Near the banks, & c. 
A READY- WITTED SOLDIER.-At a 
recent inspection of the 
Crimean veterans, an artilleryman named Davis, who had lost 
both his arms, was introduced to the Queen. 
She inquired min-
utely into the case, and expressed a 
hope that he would get a 
good pension. " Have you any friends to look after you ?" gra-
ciously asked the Queen. " Sure, an't please your Majesty, (said 
Davis, with that arch gallantry peculiar to his countrymen,) 
haven't I 
the best friend in the country when I 
have yourself ?" 
The Queen smiled and passed on; but she immediately ordered 
Davis a 
pair of steel arms in lieu of those he lost in the Crimea, 
and he had a pension of 2s. per day conferred upon him, al-
though only having two years service to reckon.

THE DARKEY NOBLEMAN. 
COMPOSED BY LON MORRIS. 
Sung by the popular Tamborinist, Billy Morris, Esq. 
From Haytie, one day, dar came a 
colored swell; 
His tongue was as smooth as the clapper of a 
bell, 
his coat was the finest of any in the town, 
His head was so strong, he could butt a 
niggar down; 
When he opened his mouth, for to grin, or cough, 
You certainly would think his head was coming off, 
His feet was so big, as he trod upon de floor, 
It broke up de furniture, and smash de parlor door. 
Chorus — Roast mutton, caper sauce, apple dumplings, too, 
Fotch along de colored folks and put de party through, 
Ring de banjo, tamborine, and play a 
pleasant tune, 
On dat most meliferous instrument de one hoss bassoon. 
Dat niggar courted all de gals, both high and low, 
And gained their confections in a 
way dat wasn't slow, 
They thought he was a 
nobleman, cause he curled his hair, 
He was nothing but a 
boot-black, I 
really do declare; 
He courted a 
widder, with her he did elope, 
Then for New Jersey that darkey he did slope; 
If we ebber cotch him again, as I 
sincerely hope, 
We ' 11 make him dance like Blondin, wid de ' sistance ob a 
rope, 
Chorus— Roast mutton, caper sauce, & c. 
This colored individual, to Portland city went, 
And circulated all about without nary a 
cent, 
He rioted on corn cake, but liv'd within his means, 
Because he learned economy, by eating Gilson's beans, 
At last he got extravagant, and lived on baloney sassage, 
And tried in the Great Eastern to get a 
cabin passage, 
But de captain did inform him dat de cabins was full, 
And that among his freight he ' d 
not have a 
bale of wool. 
Chorus — Roast mutton, caper sauce, & c.

chorus — Like the lily a 
the valley, 
Where the merry songsters play, 
Blooms unseen, the wondrous beauty, 
Of my pretty Minnie Ray. 
.She's a 
dear delightful creature, 
Tripping lightly on her way; 
Where daisies sweet, beneath her feet, 
Kiss each step of Minnie Ray. 
Chorus — Like the lily of the valley, &c. 
Through the woodland in the evening, 
Where the dancing sun- beams play, 
There I 
wander, growing fonder 
Of my pretty Minnie Ray. 
-Chorus— Like the lily of the valley, &c. 
The time will come to call her mine, 
Blessed be that happy day; 
How I'll prize those sparkling eyes, 
Of my pretty Minnie Ray. 
'Chorus— Like the lily of the valley, & c. 
COURTEOUS.— Charles Lamb, sitting down once to play whist

a 
hand you would have."

Our sister Nellie 's 
sleeping upon her mother's knee, 
Her heart has never known a 
care, she's happy, light, and free; 
No sorrows cloud the infant mind, of her we love so well, 
"While one that's dear, still watches near, our darling sister Nell. 
Chorus 
The evening bells are ringing, 
Their chimes so soft and clear, 
They ' 11 not disturb the slumbers sweet, 
Of sister Nellie dear. 
A smile of joy is stealing across her face so fair, 
Around her brow of purest white, bright falls her raven hair ; 
Sleep on, sleep on, sweet Nellie, dear, thy dreams are far away, 
Where fields are ever bright and green, and landscapes ever gay. 
Chorus — The evening bells are ringing, & c. 
She '8 
guileless as the happy bird, that sings beside the brook, 
There 's 
music in her every word, and magic in her look, 
Her mother lays her gently down, and smiling, drops a 
tear. 
And offers up a 
prayer to heaven, for her sister Nellie, dear, 
Chorus— The evening bells are ringing, & e. 
CUTTING IT Tnicx.—A German came into Buffalo with hams to

Sung by Billy Morris, with his original imitations and truthful de-
scription of that Bird of the sunny South, and received 
throughout the Union with ti emendous applause. 
I'm dreaming now of Hally, sweet Hally, 
'm dreaming now of Hally, 
For the thought of her is one that never dies; 
She 's 
sleeping in the valley, the valley, the valley, 
She 's 
sleeping in the valley, 
And the mocking bird is singing where she lies, 
Chorus — Listen to the mocking bird, 
Listen to the mocking bird, 
The mocking bird still singing o'er her grave; 
Listen to the mocking bird, 
Listen to the mocking bird, 
Still singing where the weeping willows wave. 
Ah! well I 
yet remember, remember, remember, 
Ah! well I 
yet remember 
When we gather'd in the cotton side by side; 
'Twas in the mild September, September, September, 
'Twas in the mild September, 
And the mocking bird was singing far and wide. 
Chorus — Listen to the mocking bird, &c. 
When the charms of spring awaken, awaken, awaken, 
When the charms of spring awaken, 
And the mocking bird is singing on the bough, 
I 
feel like one forsaken, forsaken, forsaken, 
I 
feel like one forsaken, 
Since Hally is no longer with me now. 
Chorus — Listen to the mocking bird, & c. 
A Yankee in Boston has set up a 
one-horse thrashing ma-
chine for the convenience of parents and guardians having 
unruly children. 
He'll lick an urchin like thunder for fourpence. 
Small lickings done for a 
cent each, and the most entire satisfac-
tion warranted.

GAL IN THE BALMORAL. 
COMPOSED BY FRED WILSON. 
As I 
was walking down de street, 
There I 
met my pretty Kate, 
I 
ax'd her where she was going to, 
She said, I'm going to skate, 
I 
walked along close by her side 
Did n't she cut a 
swell, 
With high heel boots upon her feet, 
And she wore a 
Balmoral. 
Chorus— 0, ain't there fun upon the ice, 
And lots of nice young gals, 
Mv goodness, how they glide along, 
Dressed in their Balmorals. 
We took a 
car, and reached the Park, 
A man stood at the gate, 
And charged us fifteen cents apiece, 
To let us in to skate; 
I 
paid the dimes, and in we went, 
With such a 
rush, pell-mell, 
It beat my time to keep in track, 
Of that same Balmoral. 
Chorus— 0, ain't there fun upon the ice, &T. 
She flew along, and said she'd kiss 
him that first would catch her, 
Of all the men upon the ice, 
Only one could match her; 
I 
made a 
grab, and down I 
went, 
Right on my nose, I 
fell, 
Some other darkey caught and kissed 
Her in the Balmoral. 
Chorus — 0, ain't there fun, & c. 
My face was cut, my nose did bleed, 
I 
was in such a 
plight, 
'Twas then I 
looked round for my gal, 
But she was out of sight ; 
The white folks laughed, ad told me how, 
She took that colored swell; 
And ever since, I 
faint away, 
To see a 
Balmoral. 
Chorus — 0, ain't there fun, &c.

0, how I 
love to wander forth, 
At eve, when all is still, 
Along the clear, bright, rippling stream, 
That rushes down the hill; 
'Twas there we held our trysting place, 
.'Twas there the vow was made, 
With the purest, purest heart to me, 
Jennie of the forest glade. 
Chorus:— Her clear blue eyes sparkled bright, 
And a 
dimple in her cheek was laid, 
The dearest one on earth to me, was 
Jennie of the forest glade. 
But now those happy days are o'er, 
For her pure spirit's flown, 
To that dear place of rest above, 
While I 
remain alone, 
She slumbers near the old stone church, 
Beneath the willow's shade, 
While flowers sweet are growing o'er, 
Jennie of the forest glade. 
Chorus— Her clear blue eyes sparkled bright, & c. 
My heart is sad now she is gone, 
We ne'er can wander more, 
Along that bright and rippling stream, 
As in those days of yore, 
But when my weary life is pass'd, 
The debt of nature paid, 
0, lay me in the grave beside 
Jennie of the forest glade. 
Chorus — Her clear blue eyes sparkled bright, Sze.

IN THE LOUISIANA LOWLANDS. 
Song and Chorus by Lon Morris, of Morris Bros., Pell 
Trowbridge's 
Minstrels. 
Way down in Louisiana not many years ago, 
There liv'd a 
color'd gemblum, his name was Pompy Snow, 
lie play'd upon de banjo, and on de tpnborine, 
And for rattling of de bones he was de greatest eber seen 
In the Louisiana lowlands, lowlands low, in the Louisiana low-
lands low. 
Chorus — In the Louisiana lowlands, lowlands low, 
In the Louisiana lowlands low. 
One night old Pompy started off to play for Cser Clum, 
But afore he went, he fortified, with a 
good stout glass of rum; 
When on the road, he thought he saw a 
darkey, tall and grim, 
So Pompy laid the banjo down to break the darkey's shin; 
In the Louisiana low-lands, low-lands low. 
Chorus — In the Louisiana lowlands, & c. 
Says he, old chap, just move along, or else I'll spoil your face, 
But dis darkey didn't seem to move from out his hiding-place, 
So drawing back, he crooked his head, and down at him cachunk, 
But Pompy made a 
sad mistake, for ' twas nothing but a 
stump. 
Chorus — In the Louisiana lowlands, & c. 
The stump, it proved a 
little hard, too hard for Pompy's wool, 
For when he struck, the hickory knot went through the darkey's 
skull; 
They found his banjo by his side, and Pompy lying dead. 
Spoken. 
(And ladies and gentlemen, this is the first time 
upon record that it was ever known of a 
darkey's ever coming to 
his death,) 
By de breaking of his head. 
Chorus— Den dey buried him in de lowlands, low, 
Den dey buried him in the lowlands, low. 
When a 
horse speaks what word does he say ?—Neigh. 
(Nay.)

CATS UPON DE SHED. 
COMPOSED AND SUNG BY FRED WILSON. 
Last night, as I 
lay sleeping, 
Quite soundly in my bed, 
I 
was aroused by a 
yell, 
By cats upon de shed; 
I 
on my pillow turned and turned, 
And tried to sleep in vain. 
For just as I 
began to sleep, to snore, 
That yell began again. 
Chorus— Jones' cat went me- o- u-w, 
Aloud as she could bawl, 
And every cat in town began, 
To join the general squall. 
I 
sprang right up, jumped out of bed, 
In very great affright, 
And grabbing up a 
match and lamp, 
And soon I 
had a 
light; 
With iron grasp, I 
seized my boot, 
Then opened wide the slats, 
And threw the thing wid all my might, 
Slap, bang, among the cats. 
Chorus— Jones' cat, & e. 
Now when my boot struck de shed, 
I 
stood and laughed outright, 
To see those clear domestic pets, 
Vamouse clear out of sight, 
But there was one great big tom cat, 
Who didn't even falter, 
But bid defiance, and me-o-u-ed out; 
0! I'm a 
son of Malta. 
Chorus— Jones' cat, & c. 
A Yankee editor says, he was “ like to die a-larfin' to see a 
drinkin' chap tryin' to pocket the shadow of a 
swinging sign for

POOR SALLY WARNER. 
COMPOSED AND SUNG BY FRED WILSON, WITII GREAT APPLAUSE. 
Ballad.— Very Pathetic. 
0, listen awhile, and I 
will tell, 
You of a 
dreadful murder, 
That was done not very far from here, 
Perhaps a 
little further; 
There was a 
gal, and her name was Sal, 
She sold candy on the corner. 
Chorus— Now, while you're here, pray drop a 
tear, 
For poor little Sally Warner, 
There's a 
pop corn man lives down the street, 
He wanted Sal to marry, 
But she loved a 
baker better than him, 
Because his name was Harry. 
Pop corn did black the baker's eye, 
Then, let the loafer take her. 
Chorus— While you're here, & c. 
Now, old Pop Corn thought he'd be revenged 
On little Sally Warner, 
So, he stole behind her, where she sold 
Her candies on the corner, 
With a 
vicious gripe, squeezed her wind-pipe, 
And so died Sally Warner. 
Chorus— When you're here, & c. 
They popped this pop corn man in jail, 
And then a 
jury tried him; 
The verdict was, for killing of her, 
That by his neck he should swing; 
But, alas ! he died with suicide, 
By taking too much laud'num. 
Chorus— While you're here, &c. 
The little boy who undertook to suck an egg-plum, and was 
choked by the yolk, has recovered.
