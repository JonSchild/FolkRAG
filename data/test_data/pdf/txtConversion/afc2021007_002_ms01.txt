Walt was born in 1944 in Arlington Virginia, after joining the Marines at age 17.  He did multiple 
tours in Japan and has had a deep interest in Japanese culture and lived there for extended 
periods.  He spent a year living with and working for a Japanese fishing family in Hokkaido.  He 
first started fishing in the Upper Cook Inlet Salmon fisheries and eventually settled in Seldovia.  
He eventually bought a wooden salmon troller named the Duna and trolled for salmon and 
fished for halibut for twenty years. Primarily fishing out of the northern Southeast Alaska 
community of Yakutat.  Walt is a thoughtful story teller and was very precise in his description 
of different fishing practices.   With his wife Satchiko, they prided themselves on the quality of 
the salmon they caught and delivered. Walt still fishes for halibut.

king salmon. Appeal of troll fishery King salmon fishing begins in July.  Off 
load king salmon and start coho fishing.  Second king opener Fairweather 
Grounds closed.  Fishing in Yakutat declines.  Glacial rebound results in

Changes in fisheries.  Cost of entry has risen.  Got set netting permit prior 
to Limited Entry. Participation in fishing growing so fast, limited entry 
important for conservation.    Different types of trollers, large freezer 
trollers, and smaller ice boats.  Duna was an ice boat, maximum trip 
length was five days prior to needing to make a delivery.   Fished for the 
Sea-food producers Co-op and for Sitka Sound Seafoods.  Receive same 
set price as other fishermen who didn’t care for fish as much.  Good fish 
handing resulted in their fish identified as Dunaf-fish, immaculately clean 
fish, pride in work, Satchiko responsible for the quality of their fish.  Sad 
to see size of king salmon decline.
