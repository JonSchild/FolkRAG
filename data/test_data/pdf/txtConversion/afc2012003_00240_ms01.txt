The “Big Top” Show Goes On  
An Oral History of Occupations Inside and Outside the Canvas Circus Tent 
 
About Faye Marie Loter… 
 
Faye Marie Loter was born in San Antonio, Texas in 1941 to circus performers George and 
Francis Loter. Francis was a snake charmer, cook, as well as other things, and George was a 
roper, knife thrower, and jack-of-all-trades. From an early age, Faye also worked in the 
circus. An early memory is assisting her father with this knife throwing act. At the age of 
eight she stood on the stage and advertised sideshow attractions, did cartooning, and helped 
her grandmother with an act.  
 
Faye has worked with various circuses such as the Stevens Brothers Circus, the Tex Carson 
Show, and the Carson and Barnes Circus. She also had the privilege of working for D.R. 
Miller, long time owner of the Carson and Barnes Circus. She was a parts buyer, a ‘fixer’, a 
purchasing agent, and even helped with recovering some runaway elephants.  
 
Faye and her husband, Gus, are retired and call Hugo, Oklahoma home.  
 
About William Loter… 
 
William “Billy” Earl Loter was born in Hugo, Oklahoma in 1957 to circus performers 
George and Francis Loter. Francis was a snake charmer, cook, as well as other things, and 
George was a roper, knife thrower, and jack-of-all-trades. From an early age, Billy also 
worked in the circus. He started out clowning and added unicycle, trampoline acts, fire-
eating, juggling, and wire walking. He has also worked concessions and for a while ran 
Benevolent Bill’s Bargain Bonus Basement Bonanza. 
 
The Loter family started on the Tex Carson show which later became the Carson and Barnes 
Circus. Billy has also worked for the Kelly Miller Circus and according to him, “about every 
other show in the world.” Additionally, he worked at the Texas State Fair for twenty-nine 
years and at many carnivals around the United States.  
 
Billy continues to call Hugo, Oklahoma home.

About Terry Loter Parkinson… 
 
Terry Loter Parkinson was born in Poteau, Oklahoma in 1955 to circus performers George 
and Francis Loter. Francis was a snake charmer, cook, as well as other things, and George 
was a roper, knife thrower, and jack-of-all-trades. One of Terry’s first roles in the circus was 
to ride on her father’s shoulders as he performed the unicycle and the rolling globe acts. She 
also learned a plate spinning act and later worked with dogs, ponies and monkeys.  
 
The Loter family started on the Tex Carson show which later became the Carson and Barnes 
Circus. From about the age of nine until the age of fourteen, Terry recalls working on a 
small, one-ring, family-owned mud show. As Terry grew older she decided the circus life 
was not the life or career she wanted. She married and left the circus, transferring her skills 
to raising and selling exotic animals.  
 
For a time, Terry lived in Texas but after re-marrying, she returned to Hugo, Oklahoma. 
 
About Moira Loter Curiel… 
 
Moira Loter Curiel was born in Sand Springs, Oklahoma in 1959 and is the daughter of Faye 
Marie Loter and the granddaughter of Francis and George Loter. She is the eighth generation 
of circus performers in her family and spent many years working in the circus. She has 
performed on the trapeze doing such things as the swinging ladder and aerial ballets. Also, 
Moira has performed with elephants, horses, and assisted in knife throwing acts.  
 
Moira worked on the Carson and Barnes Circus for fourteen years. She has worked for the 
Shrine Circus as well as others. She and Alfredo Curiel have three children, and she calls 
Hugo, Oklahoma home. 
  
About Alfredo Curiel… 
 
Alfredo Curiel was born in Mexico in 1949 to a circus family. His grandfather was a clown, 
and his grandmother wanted him to become a musical clown. His parents and siblings 
performed trapeze and high wire acts. In 1958 or 1959 he and his siblings took out their first 
show and until about 1981 had one of the largest circuses in Mexico.  
 
Alfredo learned various aspects of circus work from animal trainer to tent master to 
whatever needed to be done. For a short period he owned and managed his own circus, but 
Hurricane Katrina put an end to it. After twenty years on the trapeze he retired and now 
teaches the next generation of circus performers. He and Moira Loter Curiel have three 
children and he resides in Hugo, Oklahoma.

My name is Juliana Nykolaszyn. Also with me is Tanya Finchum, and 
we’re with the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program at the OSU 
Library. Today is Tuesday, June 14, 2011, and we’re in Hugo, 
Oklahoma interviewing several people about the circus. We have Faye 
Marie Loter with us, Terry Loter, Moira Curiel, did I pronounce that 
right? 
 
Curiel. 
 
Curiel. And Billy Loter. And are you joining us, sir? [Speaking to 
Alfredo Curiel] 
 
Well, yes. (Laughter) 
 
You’d better get a chair.   
 
Well, you’re welcome to join us. We’re going to go around the room and 
find out where everybody was born. We’re going to have you tell us your 
name and where you’re from, originally. 
 
Where we were born or where we’re from? 
 
Both, because I’m sure it’s two different places.  
 
Right. 
 
We’re going to begin with you, Faye. 
 
I was born in San Antonio in 1941.

And who were your parents? 
 
My parents were Francis Loter and George Dixon Loter. They were in 
winter quarters in San Antonio when I was born. I was born right 
straight across the street from the Alamo. All our kids, mostly, were 
born in the wintertime, because we’re going out on the road in the 
summer. So when the show went out again, well, you went out with the 
show as a baby, and that’s the way we lived. The kids just drug along 
and did whatever. 
 
And what did your parents do in the circus? 
 
They were performers, and they did a little bit of everything, really. My 
mother was a snake charmer and a cook, and my dad was… 
 
He did roping. 
 
My dad was a jack-of-all-trades, master of none. (Laughs) We liked to 
tease him about that, but he did everything, too.  
 
Okay. 
 
And my grandparents, on his side of the family, did a lot in the circus. 
My grandfather was crippled. He had a hunchback, and my grandmother 
learned to play the organ in case something happened to him and she 
could continue supporting herself, which she did. 
 
And what were their names? 
 
Happy, which was really William Earl Loter I, which my brother’s name 
is William Earl Loter II, and my grandmother was Mabel Marie—Mabel 
what, Palmer? Mabel Palmer Loter. She always used Marie because she 
hated Mabel. 
 
That’s news to me. I always considered her Grandma Marie. (Laughs) 
 
Well, she hated the name Mabel and she wouldn’t use it.  
 
Well, you were born in Texas, but did you grow up in Texas or 
everywhere? 
 
No, everywhere. 
 
Everywhere.

Wherever they landed for the winter. The reason we were in San 
Antonio is because it was warmer. Then I don’t know where all we did 
winter after that, California one year. I can remember that. 
  
Brothers and sisters? How many? 
 
Seven of us, five girls and two boys.  
 
Well, I bet you have some fun traveling stories. 
 
Yes, a lot of them. This brings back a lot of memories, too. My first 
grade in school, I was in El Monte, California. My sister—I started in 
first grade and she went to kindergarten. Then I was in second grade and 
she was in first grade. In California, you only go a half a day of school. 
She would get lost on the school bus, never made it home. We lived in a 
trailer park, and they’re kind of funny in California about kids in trailers 
and all that. Momma told us, “Don’t touch the fruit on the trees. Don’t 
mess with the fruit. Don’t touch those oranges.” When we left there to 
go back to work, the lady says, “I don’t know why you haven’t picked 
those oranges there. That’s what they’re there for.” And all of us kids 
just had a fit! (Laughs)  
 
It was funny. 
 
Well, we’re going to move on to Moira so we can learn a little bit more 
about her.  
 
My name is Moira Loter Curiel, married name is Curiel. I was born in 
Sand Springs, Oklahoma. It was wintertime as well, November 16, 1959. 
I think all the family was living in Hugo at the time when I was born. 
I’m the oldest granddaughter of Faye Marie—no, not Faye Marie—I’m 
the oldest daughter to Faye Marie. Francis was my grandmother, and I’m 
the eighth generation of circus people. I grew up in Texas, going to 
school in the summer, out on the road in the winter, or vice versa.  
 
Let’s see. I ended up back here because my mother lived here. I used to 
threaten my children if they didn’t behave, that I was going to send them 
to a public school! (Laughter) Well, I finally had to send them to a 
public school. I homeschooled them all the time. They started doing very 
well, and so we got stuck here. (Laughs) That’s why I’m in Hugo right 
now. But, my kids are, I’ve got one in the third year of college and one 
about to be eighteen next week, and he’s ready to go to college. He 
wants to be some kind of scientist, and my daughter wants to be in the 
medical field. 
 
And what did you do in the circus?

I did trapeze, rode elephants, rode horses, flying trapeze and single 
trapeze—there’s a difference—aerial ballet, swinging ladder. I assisted 
in knife throwing acts. Whatever they needed, I was there. 
 
Sounds dangerous. 
 
Well, the dangerous part I didn’t do. I didn’t train lions and tigers. I 
didn’t juggle. I juggled once, I think. I was very limited in what I didn’t 
do. I was young. It was fun. 
 
How did you learn to do all those things? 
 
When we’re kids, we hang off of everything, because to us that is 
normal, and so when they say, “Oh, you’re going to learn trapeze,” we’d 
say, “Cool!” So in a couple days’ time, we’d start getting blisters on our 
hands. We’re okay with that, and we just continue on and learn trapeze, 
and the next year they say, “You’re going in the show.” “Okay. That’s 
fine.” And the worst part was making the wardrobe. It wasn’t the 
practice. It wasn’t anything like that, it was just normal to us to be in the 
circus.  
 
And you had to make your own wardrobe?  
 
Not everybody’s that talented. We were young. It was grandmothers or 
aunts or friends. The circus that I joined made a lot of wardrobe. 
 
Well, I made your wardrobe, too, when you were young.  
 
I don’t remember you making my wardrobe. I remember the wardrobe 
when I first started working. Carson and Barnes made it for everyone. I 
worked on Carson and Barnes, and I spent off and on for fourteen years 
there. I went to the Shrine Circus. I went to various circuses, just 
whichever paid the most and, like I say, I ended up back in Hugo 
because my mom was here, and the kids. We would come in the 
wintertime, visit Mom and my brother, and we just ended up staying, 
because they ended up in school and doing so well. I got off the road, 
which, you still have it in your blood, but you can’t go anywhere. 
You’re grounded.  
 
All right. We’re going to move on to Terry. Tell me about you, Terry. 
 
I’m Terry Loter Parkinson, and I was born in Poteau, Oklahoma, and the 
first show I was ever on was Tex Carson, which was Carson and Barnes 
before Carson and Barnes, which was pretty neat. I have a little more 
background on the family, the history of our family.

This is our historian. 
 
Our great-great grandfather decided he was tired of being a farmer in 
Brown County, Texas, which is Comanche. Him and his brother got 
together with his brother’s four children and took out the first wagon 
show, which was Clark Brothers Circus. That’s how we started, our 
family. My mother’s side of the family started in show business, and 
they went town to town by wagon, and my great-great grandmother was 
the first wagon show owner. 
 
What was her name? 
 
Well, it was Rhoda Johnson Clark, and she was also President Andrew 
Johnson’s aunt. 
 
That’s interesting, especially for a woman at that time.  
 
Very dedicated to show business. To this day, in circus history, it’s the 
most talked about, the most well-known wagon show. They started that 
in 1876.  
 
And the name of the show? 
 
The Clark Brothers show. On my father’s side, his uncles bought and 
sold ponies for Pawnee Bill, traded and bought and sold. That’s how we 
started in show business on my father’s side. My parents were also 
Francis and George. I can’t think of anything else to say. (Laughs) 
 
How did they meet? 
 
Mom and Dad? 
 
Grandma and Grandpa. 
 
Oh, well, they grew up together. They grew up together as children.  
 
But also, on my grandma— 
 
I have a picture of Mom and Daddy in a wash tub. 
 
My paternal [grand]mother, she started on show business when she was 
fourteen, and she was in vaudeville with her father. This is the one 
(gestures to a photograph), Marie Loter. 
 
But I can’t remember how old she was when she played the piano for

silent movies, either. 
 
She was fourteen when they did that.  
 
She was littler than that when she played, because they put telephone 
books on the chair so she could play. 
 
I don’t know exactly, I just know what I know. 
 
I can’t remember how old she was. 
 
Anyway, my grandmother Marie, they did vaudeville and they both 
played mandolin. She played mandolin, he played banjo and bass. I do 
have photos of them online, but none handy right now. 
 
And what did you do in the… 
 
Oh, what did I do in the circus? Well, I think the first thing I ever did 
when I was two or three years old was with Daddy on the unicycle. I 
rode on my dad’s shoulders on the unicycle, and rolling globe. I learned 
a plate spinning act. Later on, I worked the dogs and ponies and 
monkeys, but I did quit show business when I was about fifteen. I’m still 
involved in show business, but personally, I wasn’t on the road, black 
sheep.  (Laughter) 
 
Were you also born in the winter? 
 
Yes, December 17, 1955. 
 
All right, Billy. 
 
All right, my name is William Earl Loter. I was born here in Hugo. 
 
When? 
 
1957. 
 
When? What month? 
 
Were you a winter baby? 
 
In the winter, January. (Laughter) I’ve worked, of course, in Carson and 
Barnes, Kelly Miller, about every other show in the world, and they’ve 
told most all of it. 
 
What would you do?

Unicycle, trampoline. 
 
Unicycle, trampoline, juggler, fire-eater. I walked wire. What else? It’s 
been so long. (Laughs)  
 
You also worked in Dallas. Every one of us can put up a tent. 
 
And take it down. 
 
We know how to put it up, take it down, and load it. We fold that 
canvas, sew it. 
 
It’s like Moira said, we played on the trapeze, played on it with our 
friends. 
 
The fire-eating, how did you learn that? 
 
Well, he still does that. 
 
I still fire-eat. 
 
He just did it last winter. 
 
It was on a show that the fire-eater got fired, and I took over the job for 
twenty-five dollars a week. (Laughter) 
 
How did you learn to do it the first time, though, just trial and error? 
 
It’s on that tape. That movie is my first time when I was like eighteen or 
something. 
 
And our brother was in that too, somewhere.  
 
It was like ’76. 
 
We have another brother, and his name is Richard Barnum Loter.

My uncle is a month older than me. 
 
I was pregnant and so was my mother, at the same time. We liked to 
have burnt up in Hugo. She’d lie on the couch, and I’d lie on the floor. 
We had a little old oscillating fan and we put twenty-five pounds of ice 
in front of it. Lived in a trailer and laid there. It was hot. 
 
We also have a September sister and a February sister. 
 
Right. And May is the latest one.  
 
Linda. 
 
Oh, yes. 
 
Yes, Linda’s in May. That’s like my kids. 
 
But they lived in Dallas. They weren’t on the road.  
 
I had four kids. My winter starts out, October is one daughter. I’m in 
November. My other daughter’s in December and my other daughter’s 
in January. Then my son slid in, in June. (Laughter) Well, we won’t talk 
about that. Girls won’t leave him alone on that one. 
 
Even my great-granddaughter’s born in November. 
 
Yes, but by then they were off the road.  
 
Yes.

Me too. Working with my dad… 
 
I guess… 
 
The Lynn and Richter Show. 
 
Yes, that’s probably it.  
 
I stood for knives while he [George Loter] threw knives. I worked on 
what you call a balley platform, which is the stage in front of the 
sideshow, and advertised what’s going on in the sideshow. That was 
when, oh, I was eight years old. And I helped my grandmother with 
Punch and Judy and I did cartooning in the sideshow at eight years old. 
 
Punch and …? 
 
Punch and Judy. 
 
They’re puppets. 
 
They’re puppets, hand puppets, and they do a kind of a little scene. 
 
You don’t know what Punch and Judy is? 
 
No.

Punch and Judy was. 
 
That was way back then and it was called Stevens Brothers Circus. I 
liked the man that owned it so well that I named my son after him, 
Robert Stevens.  
 
I think my first memory is, when I was about four, watching my dad put 
on his clown make-up before the circus started. If I was allowed, I would 
go watch, but I can remember that. 
 
Show kids were kind of banned from the big top during the performance. 
They weren’t allowed to go running around doing all that. You just 
knew that you weren’t allowed in the big top during the show time, 
unless you had permission. Of course, on a circus like that, you better 
have permission because somebody’s going to tell. That’s your whole 
family. They’re all watching you and it might be some other act that 
might whack you on the butt for being in there. (Laughter) But 
everybody accepts it. I mean, it’s the safest place you want to be and 
raise kids because everybody’s got their eyes on them. If anything bad 
happens, they’re the, for sure, ones that will act just like they’re your 
parents. 
 
I’m trying to remember when my first memory is. I’m thinking… 
 
Stevie, he was five when we first put him in clown make-up so that’s

I’m talking about me. (Laughs) 
 
I know. I’m trying to think. You were on Linda’s and Boots. 
 
No, Me! I remember when we were on the road when Stevie was born. 
 
Right. 
 
My mom went into labor, drives up to the hospital, she said, “Okay, I’m 
going in.” Back then, it wasn’t like it is now. I mean, you didn’t have to 
worry. I slept in the car, and all I can remember is my mom came back 
the next morning, said, “Look, you have a brother!” (Laughter) 
 
I wasn’t in there but overnight. 
 
Yes. And we were on a circus then, right? 
 
Well, yes.

There you go. That was my earliest memory.  
 
I was cooking in winter quarters. 
 
I must have been two and a half, three? 
 
I don’t know. 
 
Cooking in winter quarters. 
 
You don’t believe that? 
 
And she slept in a cardboard box under the concession stand. I put her in 
a cardboard box, and she just… 
 
Things were different. We could all get in trouble for child abuse.  
(Laughter) I used to tie my daughter up to the doorstep, because she had 
the habit of coming out of the compartment when I was riding elephants 
and the elephants used to run! I mean, they didn’t stop. I was afraid she 
was going to come out and get smashed. I’d tie her up by the waist so 
she could go in and out and play, but she couldn’t get out. Everybody 
used to say, “Oh, my God!”I said, “Would it be worse her being tied up, 
or worse if she was smashed?” She didn’t have a problem with it. I 
didn’t have a problem with it. But boy, I could tell you what would 
happen nowadays! (Laughs)  
 
I forgot what show I was on, but I was on one show and Moira was little. 
I was working and I came back to the trailer and this lady that I knew, 
she was an Italian lady, she says, “You know what Moira did?” I said, 
“What?” She said, “She shaved her dog.” She shaved that little dog, and 
they’ve never let me forget it. (Laughter) 
 
That’s the Halls’ mom, right? 
 
Yes.  
 
What’s Jimmy’s mom’s name? 
 
Aurelia?  
 
Aurelia.  
 
But every time I’d pass her trailer, she would try to feed me. I never will 
forget that. She was a terrific cook. I’m still friends with her son now. 
He stops and sees us. It was funny, they’d never let me forget Moira 
shaving that dog. (Laughs)

Then, when Moira was twelve years old, we liked to have gotten fired 
off of Carson and Barnes. 
 
I wasn’t on Carson and Barnes at twelve. I was in school. 
 
Yes. 
 
No, you weren’t. You beat up the trapeze performer.  
 
Now, Mom, I was thirteen and a half. I wasn’t thirteen. (Laughter)  
 
Thirteen and a half. Anyway, they called me to the office and told me, 
“You’re going to have to stop her from beating up the trapeze girl.” She 
was the star of the show. 
 
Well, I had a crush on a guy. Supposedly we were boyfriend and 
girlfriend, young kids. Every time I’d go back there, he was talking to 
her. So I’d go back there and punch her. Come to find out, she was 
going out with his brother. 
 
I said, “Moira…” 
 
But I didn’t know that until years later. 
 
But I called her and I said, “Let me see your hands.” All her knuckles 
were messed up where she’d been beating on that girl.  
 
How old was that girl? 
 
Like nineteen, twenty? 
 
Nineteen or twenty. She was big, and it was hard to correct Moira. 
 
She did trapeze. I was just in the concession. I wasn’t worried. 
 
Billy, do you have an early circus memory? 
 
You ought to remember, Moira… 
 
Yes, Toby Show….  
 
Oh, yes. (Laughter)

Barney wasn’t there. 
 
He wasn’t there much, but that’s way back. I lived with an elephant and 
twenty-six dogs and six ponies in the back of a semi, but it was fun. 
 
You were older, though. 
 
That was the first one, probably. 
 
What do you mean the first one? 
 
Well, we were kids and went on the Toby Show. That’s my first show, I

No, you were on Carson and Barnes and Kelly Miller and Fairyland. 
 
Well, in a shoebox.  
 
Where it all started. (Laughter) 
 
In a shoebox on Carson and Barnes.

Five rings. 
 
Five rings. 
 
Forty-six elephants. 
 
No, there were fifty-something when all the baby elephants came in. 
 
I think their tent was as big as a football field. 
 
Dory [D.R. Miller] had fifty elephants and I worked for him. I was a 
parts buyer and just a go-getter. I did a lot of stuff. Then my husband, 
when I married him, he was a mechanic and we kept that show going a 
lot of times when it was broke down and everybody was sick. 
 
Well, I want to know how you met your husband. 
 
Here in Hugo. He was one of those guys that everybody wanted, and I 
decided I was going to get him. (Laughter) I’ve been married several 
times, and we’ve [current husband] been married now thirty-eight, 
thirty-nine years. But he had a little bit of show business in him and we 
traveled. Here in Hugo it’s hard to make a living, and the easiest place to 
go is back out on the show.

lot? Do the performers kind of stay to themselves? 
 
Oh, yes, yes. 
 
The front yard and back yard.  
 
They call them “kinkers.” 
 
No, Mom. She’s talking about front yard and back yard. 
 
Well, yes, but the kinkers all had… 
 
Performers were back yard… 
 
The kinkers were called performers. 
 
Right. 
 
…the concessioners… 
 
I just threw that in. 
 
The midway stuff was front yard.  
 
If you worked… 
 
Like, us kids couldn’t go to the front yard without begging. 
 
Without getting a five dollar fine or something. (Laughs) 
 
Well, I had to live in the front yard because of what I did. I worked close 
with D.R. [Miller] and I lived in the front yard.

So what happens when you fall in love with somebody in the back yard? 
 
It’s a big one. (Laughter) There you go, right there! There you go! 
 
Problem is… 
 
This is Alfredo—your name, and all that good stuff, mister. 
 
I have to say that? 
 
Yes. 
 
Yes. 
 
Okay. (Laughter) My name is Alfredo Curiel from Mexico, and I was 
born under the big top in 1949. I was a circus performer. 
 
What month? 
 
What year?  
 
What month? 
 
What month? December. (Laughter) December 7. 
 
Yes, D-Day. Wahoo!  
 
Yes, D-Day, 1949. Like I said, I was born under the big top. I’m proud 
to say that. All my family comes from the circus, too, anyway. But if we 
talk about the back [yard] and in the front [yard], see, when I came to 
United States, I didn’t know these new rules. In Mexico, they treat you 
the same, especially when you’re a circus owner. I was a circus owner 
when I came to the United States. Anyways, if you fell in love with 
somebody in the front yard, you’ve got problems.  
 
Until after the show. (Laughter) 
 
Yes, definitely. They had to pause, I think, three weeks, or something 
like that. I don’t know what the strange rule was. 
 
Alfredo, that was a joke! By the way, this is my ex-husband.  
 
Anyway… 
 
That was a joke. We paired up for two weeks, who got the best looking 
guys or the best looking girls. We gave them two weeks. (Laughs)

Yes, but the front yard is the staff. The back yard is, was for all the 
performers. 
 
Like all the executives lived in the front yard. 
 
Exactly. 
 
And we had a cookhouse. 
 
Exactly. 
 
What they call a cookhouse is, say, the restaurant for everybody, but 
they fed us—what do they call it? The cafeteria for you guys. And we 
used to all eat in the same place. 
 
But… 
 
But at different tables. 
 
But at different tables. There was one year they decided to paint the 
tables like, I don’t know, the blue table with the red stripe goes to the 
elephant guys. The red table with the yellow stripe was for performers. 
They did all this because a lot of people came in and ate real fast or a lot 
of people have a lot of kids, and then you have the boss’s table. They 
don’t want to come and sit where all these kids have been eating so they 
had to segregate the tables. 
 
It was very segregated on that. 
 
For a while.  
 
Well… 
 
Yes. 
 
Because it didn’t work.  
 
Yes. 
 
It didn’t work. 
 
That’s something my mother also did when she retired from performing. 
She was the cook in the cookhouse for a lot of years, a lot of people. 
 
Because she had seven kids.

the cookhouse? 
 
Yes. 
 
Yes. 
 
Yes. 
 
Okay.  
 
Yes. 
 
Yes, that’s part of the deal. 
 
That’s part of your contract. 
 
Mary was talking the other day, Mary Rawls, how they had to kind of 
fight to get kids allowed to eat in the cookhouse back in the old days.  
 
Yes, that’s the reason my mother cooked, a lot of times. Or she did 
something extra in order to let us eat in the cookhouse. If she cooked, 
she might as well feed us in there. 
 
Is it still segregated today? 
 
No, no.  
 
No, not today.  
 
No, it’s now more grouped because the animal department does work 
together, the performers, they all know each other. 
 
It’s more clique-y than… 
 
Yes, it’s just wherever you want to sit. 
 
I don’t think it was segregation. I think it was just to put everybody in 
all, include people, this is what they said. 
 
Well, they didn’t want the mechanics, greasy mechanics, to sit next to

this costume and somebody in wardrobe…  
 
Yes, when we’re in wardrobe or something. 
 
…because maybe they’ll get them dirty, and the show was right after 
you eat.  
 
Yes, they were pretty much back to back. If you couldn’t eat, which 
some of us got lucky, because if we had to do what they call doors, we 
would be the ones to stand around and tell the people which way to go. 
 
And take tickets. 
 
Or sell tickets for reserves or take tickets or whatever, which these were 
the people that had to be there early. We could take our plates to our 
compartments, or trailers or whatever they were, and we could eat later. 
But for the most part we had to hurry up and eat and sit there. Like I say, 
you’d have to grab the kids or… 
 
You’d have to be there during serving time, because they only served an 
“X” amount of time, and that would be it. If you’re not there, you don’t 
get anything. So you’ve got to go in and get it early. 
 
And by the way, that’s called, “Flag’s up,” is when they’re serving food. 
A little flag goes up or they ring a bell. 
 
And then they have what you call a… 
 
Wait for it... (Laughter) 
 
They have what you call a pie car, which is where they carry the 
cigarettes and sandwiches and candy bars and chips. 
 
That’s our little convenience store. 
 
Also, they have—what do they call them? 
 
Mickies. 
 
Mickies?

Don’t hang any laundry up.

We used to hang diapers on Tex Carson. We’d tie rope to a rope and 
Momma had a little old washing machine about this big a square. 
(Gestures) You get up and do that laundry, and then we’d hang all the 
baby diapers. They’d get so mad at us for all those diapers being around 
the tent. That was when he was little.

Don’t walk when the people start to come inside the tent. You’re not 
allowed to walk in the front.  
 
To go up front.  
 
Back to the front yard-back yard thing. 
 
You’re not allowed to cross at anytime, even if there are no people in the 
big top, you’re not supposed to walk in the rings. 
 
Oh, yes. Those are old, old rules. 
 
This is something terrible. 
 
Superstitious.  
 
And don’t touch the props of other people. 
 
Don’t play the harmonica, don’t wear yellow… 
 
These are superstitions, circus superstitions.

don’t walk in the front midway when the people are ready to come 
inside the tent. Don’t hang in the guy lines of the tent when some 
performers are working their aerial act. The kids are not supposed to be 
running and close to the trucks. I mean, don’t look the people straight 
face to face if it’s not necessary. You know what I mean? 
 
I haven’t heard that one.  
 
They come in many times.  
 
No, I hadn’t either.  
 
That might be a Mexico one. 
 
“Don’t hang out with that girl. Don’t!” 
 
If I was in the big top, I was always a ticket seller or taker, and I had to 
look at the people. 
 
Well, yes, because you work over there, but they said for me, at that 
time, when I was young and beautiful and  just looking around, they 
would say, “Hey!” and they put just more fines, you know what I mean? 
A five dollar fine. Thank God they never fined me. Honestly, in my 
seventeen years in Carson and Barnes they never fined me. But there are 
many, many, many rules. And later on, you know everything, so you 
don’t do it. You don’t do what is bad.  
 
Are they like a mix of safety rules and don’t want the public to see some 
of the back operation rules? 
 
No, I’ll tell you what it is.  
 
They don’t… 
 
No, actually, there’s nothing we do that anybody couldn’t see. 
 
Okay. 
 
We weren’t supposed to be in the front door when the people came in is 
because can you imagine when you’re walking into a store and 
everybody’s hanging there watching you? You feel uncomfortable. It’s 
just not the correct thing to do. That’s basically it. 
 
And the performers weren’t allowed in the big top in wardrobe unless 
they were ready to do their act. They couldn’t run around in their 
costume.

It’s better for the business. You have to wear clean clothes because 
would you go into a—these are examples—would you go into a 
restaurant with a guy with a bunch of filthy clothes on, or would you go 
in the restaurant with the guy who has got a nice shirt and pants on? 
Those are all common sense things.  
 
They talk about the nasty show people, the town people. I don’t know 
how to say it nicely. 
 
You can say it. It’s okay. 
 
The town people look down on circus people because they confuse them 
with carnival people.  
 
For many, many, many years.  
 
Right. 
 
And carnival people were shysters and thieves and everything else. 
Well, circus people are completely different.  
 
We entertain. 
 
We are entertainers and they’re thieves. (Laughter)

Like when you started a new school somewhere else, you didn’t say, 
“I’m from the circus.” 
 
And I went to school here. 
 
If you didn’t have a life, you made one up. “Oh, I live over there on the 
corner. I’ve lived there all my life,” because the kids, they look at you 
very funny.  
 
They’d go, “Oh, you’re nasty circus people!” or, “You live in a trailer!” 
They don’t know my last trailer cost more than half these houses here in 
Hugo and it was better. It moved, too! (Laughs) 
 
But I wouldn’t talk about it for years, and I went to school here and 
sometimes I just felt like they looked down on me. Well, one thing, they 
knew we were show people, because we’re here only in the time that we 
didn’t have to work. If the show went out in March, we left in March. 
When we came back, it was October and we done missed a month of 
school, that’s too bad. We went back, you go back to school. So I went 
to the eleventh grade and then quit school because of that. But I went 
back thirty-two years later and got my GED. 
 
Well, good for you. 
 
I’m proud of that.  
 
Sure, it’s something to be proud of.  
 
But anyway, there’s a lot of stuff that went on. That’s one reason why 
David Rawls was mayor. I was president of the VFW one time, for the 
Ladies Auxiliary. We just did things to make sure they’d know that we 
could do it. That’s all that mattered. 
 
And really and truly, anybody that was in the circus or had been in the 
circus, whatever, grew up in the old families in the circus, most of the 
kids, they get jobs. They get promotions right away… 
 
They know how to talk to people. 
 
…because we know how to deal with money, we know how to deal with 
people, and we know how to do the job. You don’t procrastinate on 
anything, because it just doesn’t work with our lifestyle. 
 
Most circus people don’t meet a stranger. I mean, they’ll just talk to you 
and tell you whatever you want to know.

Now, I talk about it more than I ever did.  
 
When I was in the carnival, we didn’t talk about circus. I mean, it was a 
putdown. (Laughs) 
 
There was a dividing line. 
 
The reason circus and carnival, they get it mixed up, if you watch TV 
today it’s bad. They say more bad about us, thinking we’re carnival 
people. It’s because we were competition in the old days. 
 
Right. 
 
We sort of were the first. The reason is the sideshow took off with the 
carnival for the week, because they stayed in one town a week. We 
traveled every day, and they made more money but they left it “The 
Circus Sideshow,” and that’s how they sort of got it confused. I think 
Hollywood downgrades us, because in the beginning we were 
competition to the silent pictures.  
 
Well, we still… 
 
And [they] still are competition, because we’re live entertainment. 
 
Well, you worked in both. What do you prefer? 
 
Circus. I always claimed circus.  
 
Well, I’ve been on carnivals, too. 
 
I couldn’t be a thief. I had to do the games that were fifty-fifty chance, 
family games. 
 
Well, that was… 
 
I didn’t have the arson in me to take your house and your car. 
 
How long did you work at the Texas State Fair? 
 
Twenty-nine years at the Texas State Fair and almost all the carnivals in 
the United States, except the smaller ones. I mean, I did all the big 
shows, but I’m a good concessioner. I ran Benevolent Bill’s Bargain 
Bonus Basement Bonanza. (Laughter) 
 
Well, that’s a name. Did you come up with that name?

Bargain Bonus Basement Bonanza. Come on over! Birthday game, 
number one on the midway! Have you ever done it on your birthday? 
Well, come here, I’ll show you how! I’ve done it on May, and May was

Did you do a cigarette game? 
 
What’s the one…? 
 
Yes, I did the cigarette game. Almost every game on the midway I can 
do, except the arson.  
 
Tip sheets at Hot Springs for the races. 
 
I worked at Hot Spring. I’ve never seen a horse race in my life, and there 
I was selling tip sheets, giving y’all guys tips for the horses. (Laughter) 
But I can make change.  
 
That sounds like a racket. 
 
All of us learned how to do that early. 
 
Yes, that’s the first thing you get is an apron.  
 
I think Moira was about six when I taught her. Or five, wasn’t it? 
 
What’s that? 
 
To make change.  
 
Oh, yes. I sold peanuts.  
 
Cotton candy, twenty-five cents.  
 
No, I sold peanuts. 
 
You know why? Because I didn’t have anybody to help me so I put her 
in there while I could go to the bathroom. (Laughs) So I had to teach her

how to make change.  
 
It makes me mad when you see a movie and it says, “The Ferris Wheel 
down at the circus.” Oh, I get so mad! 
 
I do too, I do too.  
 
Well, that, or calling something somebody has done a circus. It has 
nothing to do with the circus. 
 
And wait a minute, I’m trying to think. There have been movies recently 
and I’m trying to think of which one that… 
 
Some new movie. 
 
Oh, what was it? Just recently, and they said something about, “Yeah, 
like the circus people,” and I’m like—and every circus people will do 
the same thing.  
 
They’ll sit up and wonder, “What are they talking about?” 
 
What does this mean? 
 
I think it’s one of their writers. It’s a special line in there because they 
use that line all the time.  
 
Yes, like we’re some kind of freaks. Do we all look like freaks? We’re a 
little strange, but we’re not freaks.  
 
They just said that with Obama this morning.  
 
Well, everybody’s a little strange.  
 
We don’t have arms growing out of our heads and things like, I mean… 
 
We always say that what’s left of the circus when we leave is, 
“Nothing’s left but peanut sacks and wagon tracks.” 
 
Yes, that’s an old saying. Yes, when the movies make comments, we 
catch every one of them. All show people do. 
 
Not just movies. Everything does it, everything.  
 
Yes, songs. 
 
When they refer to a circus when they have a fight.

Oh, it was Casey Anthony. 
 
If you want to know which one is the movie to this… 
 
Always saying, “What a circus!”  
 
Oh, did they convict her today? 
 
No.  
 
…really close to the circus life is Trapeze. That’s the name of the movie, 
Trapeze. 
 
Yes. It had… 
 
With Burt Lancaster and Tony Curtis. 
 
Yes. 
 
And Gina Lollobrigida. How do you pronounce it? 
 
Gina Lollobrigida. 
 
It’s Italian. It’s Italian. Gina Lollobrigida. Anyway, it’s the best movie 
you can find that’s very close to the circus.  
 
Burt Lancaster was catcher in a flying act on a circus before he did that. 
 
And he was also in “real” show business at one point. 
 
Before he became a movie star. 
 
Oh yes, yes. What other actors have been in the “real” show business? 
 
Because in the movie… 
 
One of the Nelsons. 
 
I was trapeze flyer all my life… 
 
David Nelson.

do the triple somersault, he tells him exactly what it is—exactly the 
timing, exactly how he needed to break the—when they jump from one 
to the other one, he tells him exactly what it is in the real life, in the 
circus. In the other movies, I’ve never seen in my life people dressed in 
costumes twenty-four hours a day, but they do in the movies. (Laughter) 
The clowns, they never take the makeup off. It’s just is not true. So 
sometimes they have to make something really, really like the circus. 
But I don’t think they’re going to find a circus, I mean the trouble with 
the circus… 
 
Even the new movie out now, Water for Elephants is just a love story… 
 
Yes, but I didn’t see it. Did you? 
 
That movie was done by a friend—well, not by a friend of mine. The 
equipment in that movie is a friend of mine’s equipment and a lot of the 
people that are in that movie are a lot of my friends. That movie almost 
didn’t take place because they wanted to portray, like in the book, where 
the elephant trainer was an abuser and the elephant trainer that they got, 
he refused to… 
 
Who was the elephant trainer they got?  
 
Gary Thomas.  
 
Oh my, gosh! You know who Gary Thomas is? 
 
Yes, Mother. I had a crush on him at thirteen. Not thirteen and a half!  
(Laughs)  
 
He’s the one that turned the elephants loose here in town. 
 
Yes, that’s the one. 
 
I thought that was you! (Laughs) 
 
No, it wasn’t. I was driving the truck. 
 
Oh, you were driving the truck.  
 
Tell me about the elephants getting loose in town. 
 
Dory Miller called me. I wasn’t doing anything. I was drawing 
unemployment here in town. He called me and asked me to come to 
Minnesota and drive these elephants back down to Laredo. There were 
three of them. We get to Hugo and we had some poles to unload before

we went any further. Well, I went in the house to change clothes, this 
Gary Thomas opened the doors and I told him, “Don’t take those 
elephants out except one at a time.” And Dory told him the same thing. 
Well, I went in the house to change clothes and while I was in the house, 
he takes them all out and they run. They’d been in that dark truck and 
they wanted to get out. They were, oh, I guess they were about five foot 
tall, not very big. They took off, jumped the fence, and it was a month 
later before we got them all back. That’s the story. 
 
Didn’t they find them on an island in Hugo or something or the lake? 
 
No, it was down on the lake, Corps of Engineers’ property, one elephant. 
But the other ones I got right away. But this one, I had to tranquilize him 
to get him loaded and the whole bit. But this Gary Thomas, it was too 
hot for him. 
 
He was in his twenties. He probably stayed in and had the air. 
 
Stayed in the air conditioner with his girlfriend. 
 
I was married and living in Tyler, Texas, which is Southwest of Fort 
Worth—no, I lived in Weatherford, I’m sorry. My husband said, “I think 
you need to wake up. Your sister’s chasing elephants on the news.” He 
was just real laid back. “Oh, okay.” (Laughter) 
 
I had everything, but it all burned up here, last year. Was it last year or 
year before? Last year in our well house—we have a well house, we live 
in the country—and the motor caught on fire and burned a lot of my 
stuff up. I was really upset about that. I had all the clippings and even 
had all the war clippings from the other war—what was it? Before 
Afghanistan. I had all that. I had a lot of stuff, and it all went down the 
drain. It made me sick. But anyway, that’s the story of the elephants.  
 
Well, I want to know about life on the road. I want you to tell me about 
your living quarters. 
 
You’re trying to get some bad stuff out of us, aren’t you? You’re just 
bound and determined! (Laughter) 
 
When I first started, when I got older—well, not older, either.  
 
When you were little you all lived in a bus, and you got soot in your 
nose. That’s all I can remember. (Laughter) 
 
No, that was…

That’s when I was a baby.  
 
There you go. That’s the story I remember.  
 
We had a kerosene heater, and that sucker gets to smoking… 
 
What do you think it did to the baby? (Laughter) 
 
Me! Me! (Laughs) 
 
You get up and wash it off. But that happened about six and a half times 
a week. 
 
It was an old school bus my daddy built bunk beds in and stuff. I had 
seen it years later, right down the road. 
 
That thing was so cold. We’d wake up and there’d be ice on the 
windows about that tall and about that thick, but we lived in that for 
quite awhile. Then, when Moira was born, I lived in a trailer that used to 
belong to my grandfather that he left Mother when he died. It was a 
long—wasn’t it like Schultz or something? 
 
Like I’m going to remember.  
 
Well, I was trying to think.  
 
It had round windows.  
 
It was an old trailer. 
 
It had wheels. (Laughs) 
 
We lived in there quite awhile.  
 
It had round windows on it. 
 
When Moira was born and she lived in there, and Barney was born and 
we lived in there with those two babies. Momma would put Barney in 
the playpen and you got the bed. 
 
Well, I was in the playpen, right? 
 
Oh, okay.

And when Barney, my brother, would crawl by, she’d [Moira] grab his 
diaper and hold it and he’d start screaming and carrying on. 
 
Yes, I finally got him!  
 
Anyway, when he got to walking, he turned the stove on one day and I 
had a date. I was going to keep this date because I really liked that guy, 
and… 
 
Were you thirteen? 
 
No. I was eighteen.  
 
Okay. 
 
Anyway, I went to get a cup of coffee and the stove exploded. Burned 
my eyebrows off, my eyelashes, and I kept the date anyway because I 
liked this guy. (Laughter) 
 
Didn’t you and Darlene and Linda stay in a different trailer when we 
were young? 
 
You want the routine of the circus life? 
 
Sure. 
 
You wake up in the morning, like four o’clock in the morning. You get a 
donut and a cup of coffee, and you drive to the next town. Each truck 
comes in, it’s like the poles first and then the tent… 
 
Usually it was cookhouse first. 
 
Cookhouse first and pole truck, then the tents and then when the tent’s in 
the air, you got to eat breakfast. 
 
About eleven. 
 
About eleven o’clock, and then you don’t get any time off, maybe an 
hour off before the show starts. Then you do a show, and then you go to 
the cookhouse when the flag went up. You got to eat your… 
 
If it was a two o’clock show, it’d be around four o’clock, 4:30, when 
you ate. 
 
You’d get to eat. Then you’d do another show after that when you’ve 
got a full belly. (Laughs)

And then you get to go to the pie car and spend your money.  
 
You got to tear down, you got to bed maybe two, three o’clock in the 
morning, then you get up at four again, and do it every single day. 
 
That’s the run. That was twenty-four—well, when Gus and I were 
working, I was parts buyer and him mechanic, we were on call twenty-
four/seven. We were liable to be out for two days, not get back to the 
show. 
 
And how would you know where you were going next?  
 
You got a little slip of paper each morning… 
 
What they call a route card. 
 
…called a route card and it said how to get there. You had arrows on the 
telephone poles and they led you there, and you just follow the rest of 
them. 
 
They put your route slip on your windshield most of the time and it says, 
“You go on 70. Then you go 271 to so and so,” and you figured it out. 
When we were real little, we learned how to look for arrows going into a 
town, which were about this tall (gestures about twelve inches) and they 
had a language all of their own.  
 
One of the funniest stories… 
 
And that was my job was to look for the arrows. And I learned how to 
read arrows when I was… 
 
…and a map. 
 
No, I still can’t read a map. (Laughter) But it’s a rich life, and we can 
say we’ve probably been in every state in the United States at least once. 
 
I have been.  
 
Yes, me too, at least twice. 
 
And Alaska. 
 
And I’m guessing the living quarters got better as the years went on.

Depends on how much money you made. (Laughs)  
 
Compared to your time? 
 
Well, when we were on the road, my time, we had ice for refrigeration. 
If you didn’t empty the pan under the refrigerator, you had a wet floor. 
Then you go to her [Moira’s] time, where she had a luxurious fifth 
wheel, much nicer than a lot of people’s homes. 
 
And we never had air condition or nothing like that when I was young. 
 
No. 
 
I had central heat and air. (Laughs) 
 
Me, I had a truck cab. 
 
No, we didn’t have running water. We had electricity, but we’d have to 
carry our water to the trailer. 
 
One bucket of water at a time.  
 
I had a big tank. (Laughs) And to go to the bathroom, I had my own 
little bathroom.  
 
That is another good memory. 
 
It wasn’t easy.  
 
You’d have the water truck coming. It’d go fill up somewhere in town 
then come back, and if you wanted to wash your hair you literally stood 
under the little spout.

two brothers, and she would start out with the bathwater and it went 
down from there, the same bathwater, because there wasn’t a lot of 
water. She wasn’t going to carry anymore for us.  
 
And I’m only joking. I only did the trailer thing the last few years. I also 
lived in what they called a compartment and you share a compartment. 
They’re bunk beds, like a dormitory in school. Bunk beds, little bit of 
space, and you might get a closet, if you got lucky and got that big 
compartment.  
 
Except for my younger years, from the time I was nine until the time I 
was fourteen, I was on a very small mud show, what they call a mud 
show, and it was a one-ring family owned and we did everything 
ourselves. We didn’t have outside help and in a way, I was raised 
quite—circus business was different for me.  
 
Come here [talking to daughter who just entered the room]. Let me 
introduce you to these women.  
 
No ugly words. (Laughs) 
 
These women are the ones that are doing the history of the circus. This is 
my daughter, Claudette. She’s the second of my family. When’s your 
birthday? 
 
October 18, ’82. 
 
Winter baby.  
 
We’re talking about everybody being winter babies.  
 
It’s true. 
 
Now, she works at a department store and raising her kids and is going 
to school. 
 
In fact, my first one was a winter baby for that reason, too. 
 
There you go, see?  
 
She works at Stage [department store], but she was also a performer.  
 
Yes, she was. We have pictures of her everywhere.  
 
They’ve been trying to get her to be a manager at Stage.

And what did you do in the circus? 
 
When I was a performer I did the silks, the chiffon, and the roman rings.  
 
That’s what I did.  
 
Are you up there? 
 
And one aerial act with her older sister.  
 
Yes, where are all the real pictures?  
 
I’ve only got a few of them. 
 
That’s her sister right there with the blue costume on. 
 
Well, her older sister will be here over the Fourth of July. 
 
And that’s me in the orange headband.  
 
And when you think about it, get your dad to say Gina Lollobrigida.  
 
Gina Lollobrigida? 
 
Only she doesn’t say… 
 
Gina Lollobrigida. 
 
I said it the same way. What are you talking about? How am I supposed 
to say it? I’m pronouncing all the—I annunciate.  
 
And Moira works at Simple Simons now and she’s assistant manager. 
 
Good organizational skills and time management.  
 
After circus, everything’s easy. (Laughs) 
 
Know why? A lot of it is, we count the money, we’re honest, we get the 
job done, and nobody has to constantly tell us what to do. 
 
Well, we have the incentive to do it. If nobody else is going to do it, we 
just go ahead and do it.  
 
Yes, without being told. 
 
Has anyone mentioned our new circus group up here in Hugo? [referring

to the Circus City Showmen’s Club] 
 
Yes, they were there.  
 
I wasn’t there. 
 
Do you miss being on the road? 
 
It took me a long time to settle in Hugo. I would go to Ada and go 
shopping, just to be going. 
 
When you get sawdust in your blood, you’ve got to go. (Laughs) 
 
I hate to admit it, but when they leave town here in the spring, I go out 
on the highway and watch. You have a certain… 
 
Well, I still go to see David when it’s over. 
 
…you have a certain—Momma used to call it “itchy house shoes,” 
because she wanted to go, but she got too old to go. She had the itchy 
house shoes. 
 
We all have to go and see our friends off and say goodbye if we can, 
which is opening day. All circus people go and they all say goodbye to 
everybody. Then when they come back in the fall, we try to always go to 
the last show and just, “Oh, yes! You have the season and everything 
was great.” That’s what we retired people do. (Laughter) 
 
Well, tell me some lingo. We heard about “flag’s up” and “flag’s 
down.” 
 
The “eagle has landed,” payday.  
 
“Cherry Pie.” 
 
“Cherry Pie,” “Hey, Rube.” 
 
“Hey, Rube.”  
 
Cherry pie—but explain what they are.  
 
“Cherry pie” is just general labor.  
 
Like, say, I get the privilege of selling coloring books. In order to keep 
that privilege, I have to go put up a marquee, or the entrance, or just…

That’s called cherry pie. You have, it’s to keep that privilege, basically. 
“Hey, Rube” is there’s getting ready to be a fight, a head’s up. 
 
If there has been, if it’s real loud, it’s really important.  
 
Kinkers are performers. What is it? 
 
How come circus people talk carnie talk? 
 
The bull. (Laughter)  
 
They do. 
 
Out of self defense. 
 
Maybe. 
 
I was going to say, those are fighting words. 
 
Actually, we do. 
 
Actually, we still speak carnie. 
 
Mizzy spizzizzle spizzy izzle izzon izzie. 
 
Yes, there you go. It’s not Pig Latin. We don’t talk Pig Latin. We talk 
carnie talk.  
 
I spoke it so much in front of my ex-husband, he finally learned it. She 
and I would do it, and he finally picked up on that, but we still use that 
language. 
 
Yes, they use it so the public can’t tell what you’re doing. 
 
Now we do it to keep the kids from knowing what we’re talking about. 
 
Yes, now it’s for the kids.  
 
What else is there, guys? 
 
There’s “bulls,” which are elephants. We call them bulls.  
 
“Rigging.”

“Rigging” is all the props that we use. 
 
Props is equipment for the act. 
 
Oh, yes. Sorry. Property. “Spec” is spectacular. 
 
Which is the… 
 
The walk around that we do when all… 
 
…the parade at the beginning of the show. 
 
“Blow off” is the end of the show.

A “dukie” is a little coupon that you get that you can spend at the pie 
car. 
 
Yes, it’s like a—it used to be a credit card. 
 
Like a tip. Yes, it used to be like a credit card. (Laughter)  
 
They used to use a punch. 
 
A dukie? 
 
A dukie. 
 
A pre-paid credit card. You get a five dollar dukie, then you could spend 
it how you wanted to, and all you had to do is to punch out the holes. I 
forgot about those. 
 
They would have a dollar and fifty cents and all that.

Oh, yes. 
 
Let’s see, what else?  
 
Well, we’ve got the pie car and the cookhouse.  
 
If I was on the show, I could tell you all of them.  
 
I know. It’s all normal stuff to us so we have to think about it. Winter 
quarters, of course, is our place of stay in the winters.  
 
Well, when you pulled onto the lot did you have to go to the same place 
every time, or how did you know? 
 
You usually have what you call a superintendent on a lot that lays it out.  
 
That’s the twenty-four hour man.  
 
It’s called a layout. You’ve got your layout. There you are.  
 
Your twenty-four hour man and superintendent tell you where to park. 
They may change it up for a reason, if there’s not enough room. 
 
But normally… 
 
We never got to go to the front end. 
 
Normally, the animals would be close to the back door because they 
have their cages and things. 
 
Back door is performance. 
 
Performers and then you had the ones that had the most props, or the 
biggest props, and then you had the ones that just did a trapeze act or 
something. I could run. I had no problem.  
 
In the United States, they never live in the little tents. We just always 
lived in trailers or trucks.  
 
Or under the truck, or in the cab. 
 
I’ve slept in possum bellies. [compartment under a semi-trailer] 
 
No, no, see, I remember. Like I said, I was born in the circus and we 
lived in small tents around the circus in my country. We don’t know

anything about travel trailers or motor homes or anything. I remember 
when I started to work, I was seven. My grandfather was a clown and 
my grandmother wanted me to be a clown, a musical clown, and they 
gave me a teacher to teach me music and to play all different kinds of 
instruments when I was a kid. But I was very good in the circus so I do 
almost everything.  
 
The men got to do everything. 
 
And we lived in the small tents. I remember when the rain came, we had 
to make a big ditch around the tent to keep the water out of the tent. 
Sometimes big storms, they would tear down our tents. We would have 
to go to the nearest house over there to keep out of the rain because we 
didn’t have a tent. That was 1954, ’55, and 1957, me and my brothers 
and sisters, we worked in the streets, collecting money, because we want 
to make our own show. It was 1957. We made our first stand in 1958, 
’59, and in 1959 we bought our first truck. From 1959 to 1981, we got 
one of the biggest circuses in my country. So what the funny thing is, we 
were too little, but our parents put us in charge of everything. Everything 
about the—be owner, be—think about it. Keep making orders to the big 
guys. You know what I mean? But we had to do it, because there were 
thirteen in the family and we had to do it. 
 
Of course, like I said, to eighty-something, ’81, ’83, we got a big show. 
We got a big show in 1974 when somebody come and said, “Come to 
United States. It’s nice over there,” and in that time we got good odds of 
the family, and we wanted to see United States so we came to the United 
States. The sons, in 1974, we worked ’74, ’75, and on and on and on and 
on and on, and one good day, I was married already with my ex-wife 
and the American Consulate in Monterrey just told me—she was my 
friend. She gave me a Visa all the time when I wanted one—she said, 
“Alfredo, you have to decide where are you going to live, United States 
or Mexico, now, because your kids have got to go to school.” So I 
decide to come to United States. In that time, I started to know what 
travel trailers were. (Laughs) I was learning what it was like to live in a 
travel trailer because I didn’t know anything. Even the big shows in 
Mexico in the ’60s, they still got out nice tents. Small tents for your bed, 
your big trunk box for your costumes and everything.  
 
Did you speak much English when you came over? 
 
He still doesn’t speak much English. (Laughter) 
 
I still don’t speak English. I’m still, no. The funny thing, when they tell 
me, “We are going to go to United States,” I immediately start studying 
in the records. Remember the records? I started to study a little bit of

English, a little bit, because I didn’t have much time to learn. But, of 
course, over here, I decided all my friends have to be Americans, to 
learn. If I’m stuck with the Mexicans, I won’t learn anything. So then 
my friends were only American friends. At that time, Carson and 
Barnes, everybody is American over there. Now, it’s different, but in 
that time, the big top was American. The candy butchers were 
Americans. The mechanics and everybody were American. So I was the 
guy to be close to them to learn what they said and what I said. I’ve still 
got broken English, but now I understand. If somebody tells me 
something bad, I know. But at that time, it was different. But later, like I 
said, you have the opportunities in the United States and then you start 
to be better and better and better, but I still miss my country. In my time 
in Mexico, we got a big tent. Behind the big top there’s a tent and it’s 
the wardrobe tent. They divide it by a piece of canvas so one side was 
for the men’s costumes and everything, and the other side was for 
women’s. So it was funny, and I mean, was a funny thing over there. 
(Laughs) 
 
I think we did it here, too.  
 
Yes? 
 
Were you a performer? 
 
Yes. Yes, trapeze. 
 
He was. 
 
Since I remember, I was a performer. Yes. My mom was a performer, 
too. She would do one act that—what do you call it now? 
 
Iron jaw.  
 
Yes. They pick it up by… 
 
The teeth. And they’re in the air. 
 
They told me one day she fell, she was hit, she fell, and she didn’t die 
immediately, but she died for that reason. Something was going bad and 
she died. I was three years old. But I still remember the thing. In the 
circus, all the kids, like everybody says here, it’s different because you 
travel too much. Your mind, your brains work in different ways. 
 
Yes, there are some things that I’ve done that I don’t even believe I’ve 
done. You know what I mean? But when my friends bring it up, oh, yes.

You are smart because you travel too much, you learn everything, many 
things, and you are different from town people, I guess. 
 
Yes, it took me like two years to pick up the telephone and answer it 
when I got off the road because I didn’t deal with the telephone. I didn’t 
know what to say on the other end. (Laughs) It was like two years later 
before I’d answer the phone. 
 
Well, what happened if you got injured? 
 
You’re on your own. 
 
You’re on your own, which, for this reason, you practiced a lot.  
 
They do have something for performers, what is it? 
 
Well, nowadays you have to buy your own insurance. 
 
Yes. 
 
If you work for somebody, they pay half and you pay another half, but 
only—if here I go to work at any circus for two weeks, three weeks, we 
call them spot dates. Well, they pay you good money, but you’ve got to 
pay your own insurance. But normally, in my time when I was 
performer, I fell many times, no, you don’t. It’s sad to say, but in the 
contract it’s… 
 
It hasn’t been that long that they’ve made you buy your own insurance.  
 
They say probably ten? Ten years, ten, fifteen years? But before, no. 
 
Would you ever do another job? 
 
Honestly, no. This is my first time. This is my first time and it’s hard. 
It’s hard to stay in one place. Especially—you know what you miss the 
most? What I remember—because I’m an old guy in the circus. All my 
life was in the circus. Twenty years on the trapeze plus I don’t know 
how many years a high wire walker, animal trainer. You name it. But 
you miss the most sometimes at night. This is true. I’m not making it up. 
This is true. Sometimes at night, I wake up and I feel—when you go 
inside the big top and you smell the sawdust, when you hear the roar of 
the lions at night, it’s something. 
 
Let’s face it. The elephant poop smell also has something to do with it.

You smell it. You feel it. It’s something in you. Especially, sometimes 
I’m dreaming and I’m dreaming when, before I go to work, before I go 
all the way up in the trapeze, I dream I put my arm bands on and I’m 
prepared, and when I do any trick in the air, I do in the air. I do in the 
dream. I do it. Before I do, everything is, I hear the [imitates drum roll] 
of the drummer, and when I do the somersault in the air or something, I 
hear what I hear when I really did it, when I was young. You just, you 
hear the air, like a [imitates wind] but silence, and immediately, when 
your catch, you hear the people, the exclamation of the people. “Wow!” 
And then you come back to your trapeze and then you jump and you 
platform and oh my God! It’s so beautiful! And I miss it. I missed that 
for many years. 
 
And we’re too old to do it anymore, though.  
 
And believe me, this is true. Probably, it’s because I really love the 
circus. I really love the circus. 
 
The closest I… 
 
Sometimes, I cry, yes, sometimes. I feel like, I say, “Why me? Why did 
I leave the circus?” But I recognize later on, “I don’t leave the circus, the 
circus leaves me,” because here comes the age when you can’t move 
fast, you understand me? Sometimes it’s hard to accept it and still, I 
practice with the kids right here in the backyard. Sometimes I have to 
tell them and show them how to do the pirouette, and I do. I’m still the 
one at sixty-two. I’m still doing it. But the next day, I can’t move.  
(Laughs) 
 
My husband’s seventy-five. 
 
And… 
 
And he still works on our car and pickups… 
 
…I don’t want to be old. I don’t want to be old. I don’t. I don’t. I want to 
do something all before, I hope. I pray to my God, if I die, have to be in 
the circus. Have to be. I got my trapeze bar and I’ve got my arm bands 
and I already tell my kids, “That is the last thing you’re going to put in 
with me.”  
 
I might need that trapeze bar. (Laughter) 
 
Since I’ve become a towner, the closest thing I’ve got to circus is I was 
doing logos on the water towers around Texas and stuff.

Was it closest? 
 
Yes, because I was up in the air and it was just freedom, and I would run 
around on the rope around the tower. (Laughter) It was great. I mean, 
it’s the closest I’ve come to like performing in a circus. 
 
That’s what I was saying earlier that somehow, we always end up with 
something, like my daughter. My daughter works at Stage. She deals 
with people every day. She’s not really a people-person, but after work, 
she’s looking for parades to go do, sell cotton candy in the parades, and 
she’s selling handbags that she orders and stuff. My other daughter, she 
makes leotards and she’s selling them on eBay. Well, my daughter’s in 
college, but she comes home, she is a tutor-mentor at school, but she 
works the winter parades. I mean, we always are still in it somehow. 
 
Some reason, we have to be… 
 
And she told me that she almost got a job, she goes to Amherst College. 
They were looking for someone to work in the cafeteria. The thing that 
impressed the guy that was interviewing, he says, “I’ve got a lot of 
people above you, but I wanted to meet you because you’re the only one 
that wrote down you could count back change.” (Laughs) So that’s what 
drew their attention. And she said, “Well, my mom taught me when I 
was a little kid. You count back change.” Okay, fifty, one dollar, two 
dollar, three, and you count it back. And they love it without all the 
computers. 
 
Well, how old is too old? Like, what is retirement age? 
 
Look at me. 
 
There used to not be a retirement age. 
 
Look at me! This is it right here!  
 
Your body gives up on your act. 
 
Yes. 
 
Yes. 
 
Here comes the moment, this is it, though. I tell you what I live through, 
because I was, like I said, I was a performer all my life! All my life, 
okay? I do, I swear, so many acts I don’t even remember how many 
because I was a circus person. We call them circus people in my 
country, probably in United States, too, but I don’t know. I talk about

my country, when you say, “I’m a circus person,” it’s because you know 
tumbling in the ground, you know how to go and make a swing and do 
tricks on the trapeze, or do anything else. Important thing you have to 
know how to do is tumbling on the mat, on the ground. I mean, like 
acrobats. This is what makes you a circus person. 
 
But it makes you sore in your old age. (Laughter) 
 
Then I started flying in the trapeze with my brother. My brother has got 
kids. My nephews were starting to fly. My brother’s retired, and I was in 
the trapeze. My nephews are retired and I’m still on the trapeze, because 
in my mind was, “I’m so good and I can do it. I still can do it and I look 
great!” Okay? But here comes the moment when something happens, 
and you say, “I missed it. I missed it. Oh, I got a mistake! I made a 
mistake!” No, you didn’t make a mistake. You did the correct thing, but 
it was your body that didn’t respond like it did before. Everything is in 
your mind. 
 
Yes. 
 
A long time ago, there was no age to retirement. There weren’t as many 
circus people, either. Now, our generation had kids and we taught our 
children. The correct thing to do is to back out and let—that’s what 
happened to me. I quit when I was five months pregnant with my son.  
(Laughs) 
 
Yes. 
 
I flew in the flying trapeze act until I was five months pregnant. 
 
It’s true. 
 
But I had a daughter that was eighteen and I had another daughter that 
was ten, at the time. I had all these other kids that could do it and so 
when I had to back out, they started doing other things to compensate 
the salary, basically, and I ended up being the manager. I ended up doing 
all this other stuff, which we’re still in it, but not the performing thing. 
Then I had to raise my son, of course, and my son’s going to be 
eighteen. So that’s how long I’ve been out of it.  
 
Our other brother that isn’t here, he could tell you some good stories. 
Barney. 
 
Oh, that’s what we were talking about earlier. My grandfather had this 
bright idea, since we were circus people and my mom had just had me 
and my uncle was born right at the same time, his name is Richard

I was wondering if there was a connection. 
 
Yes. I meant to say that earlier, and I had forgotten, but yes, Barnum and 
Bailey.  
 
When they got old enough, one day they had a piece of canvas out there 
in the yard and they put it over their heads and called it Barnum and 
Bailey. 
 
We said, “Oh, now we’ve finally got our circus.” We were like forties. It 
was a little late, but… 
 
But yes, the circus is beautiful. The circus life is beautiful. It’s the most 
incredible life. I don’t know the rest about the—if I got a chance to be 
born again, that’s what I would to do. Here comes the moment when, 
now, my kids are in college, they are starting something. I push them to 
do it. My son says, “Dad, you don’t want to me be like you?” I said, 
“No, you have to be better than me because I don’t want you to fight 
against the winds. I don’t want you to fight in the storms.” Take down 
the tent because the tornado came, and they give you ten minutes to tear 
down all your stuff and run away. I don’t know how many times we had 
to do that? Hundreds.  
 
And if you don’t show up for that tear down, you’re… 
 
You’re in trouble. But I tell him, “Later on, you’ll recognize that there 
are things make your life with flavor, make your life different. Those are 
small things so then your things make you different.” Me, I never think, 
“Here comes the day when I have to say, ‘that’s it.’” One day, when I do 
the trapeze act and I see my brother, my younger brother, he flies so 
incredibly easy, and I had problems to do my tricks. I said, “I think it’s 
time to quit.” It was hard for me, very hard. I cried my last day. I said 
bye and that was it. Like a month later, we were working in Milwaukee, 
Wisconsin, big people, big show, lot of circus people come to the circus. 
The circus was packed, and here comes my older brother. 
 
He said, “Alfredo, put your clothes, put your ties, put your arm bands 
on. You’re going to fly today.” I said, “No,” he said, “Yes!” “No, no, 
no,” I said, “Look, it’s a lot of people, circus people here. Put in the 
young people. They look beautiful.” He said, “No, no, no, no. I want you 
right there.” I said, “Why you want me?” He said, “Alfredo, you were 
great in the trapeze and this is what the people love, to see you, some 
crazy guy, right there and you’re going to do it.” And I did it and I did

my tricks. Everything was okay and my nephew thanks me he said, 
“Thank you, Uncle, because without you we couldn’t do anything like 
that.”  
 
You know me right now, but when I was over there, I was—Mr. D.R. 
Miller, the owner of Carson and Barnes, he told me, he said, “I like to 
see you in the trapeze all the time because you do something different 
every night. You’re a crazy guy in the air.” I took a lot of risk, in other 
words. I do many dangerous things and blah, blah, blah. But you never 
think in the circus, one day it’s going to be over. This is my point. It 
doesn’t matter how good you are, one day you are going to—if you’ve 
got your career, like my kids and how they prepare for their life, one is 
going to be doctor, the other one is going to be in the ocean. I don’t 
know what he wants to do over there. 
 
He’s thinking marine biologist. 
 
I even thought that… 
 
Big words.  
 
Big word for me. 
 
…circus was going to be forever for me. I even thought circus was going 
to go on.  
 
Yes, There are beautiful parts but there are sad parts. The sad part is you 
travel to the most incredibly beautiful and big cities in the world and 
now, I’m stuck in Hugo, Oklahoma. 
 
You’re not stuck. You can go. (Laughter) 
 
Well, how did you two meet? 
 
In the circus. 
 
In the circus. Well, yes. It was in the circus. 
 
He came from Mexico, I was already on the circus and that two week 
period I was talking about, yes, we hooked up in that two week period 
and… 
 
But the funny thing is, at that time, like I told you, I don’t speak good, I 
still don’t speak good English. But she speaks Spanish so I wanted to be 
her friend to catch in other girls because that was my point.

I’m glad I know this now…  
 
We married in Laredo, Texas. After that, after we married, we lived 
together for almost twenty-five years, twenty-six years.  
 
More like thirty. I was counting. (Laughter) 
 
And one good day, probably we tire and we separated and now, we’re 
okay. The kids are here, my kids are here, they love me, and they love 
her. 
 
He lives in my son’s room. We divorced, but he’s still living in the 
house. (Laughs) 
 
I’m still paying the rent, lights, everything, so… 
 
Not everything! Shut up. 
 
And buy a car. 
 
Yes, but most of our family, brother-in-laws or… 
 
Yes, it seems like they never leave. 
 
They’re still family. 
 
Yes. 
 
They aren’t just like, “Get out of here,” and you’re gone. You’re still—
we know you.  
 
Yes, like I’m… 
 
My neighbor’s husband still comes back and they’re divorced.  
 
That’s my oldest daughter. 
 
My daughter, she… 
 
Claudette’s husband, off and on. 
 
…divorced and her ex-husband is my best—is like my son.

They’re still family. 
 
And when she divorced my uncle, I said, “Well, that’s great and all, but 
I want you to know, Scott’s my uncle.”  
 
No, no, it’s, we’ve got something, I think, in our life… 
 
We go down and we visit him. 
 
…in our life and the circus makes you a little bit—we got our roots from 
Americans, from Italians, from Gypsies, from different kind of traditions 
and roots. If anything, even if you don’t know you’re adopted, like him, 
for me, is my uncle. He’s Uncle Billy. He’s my family. His problems are 
my problems. You understand me? That is the beauty of the circus, 
probably, because in the… 
 
I’m going to switch gears for a second on you.  
 
Sure. 
 
Go ahead.  
 
So when the circus comes back and you all are in winter quarters, what 
are you doing? 
 
I love you honey, but the season’s over. (Laughter) 
 
That’s about what it is, too. 
 
That’s true. That’s true. 
 
Are you working any, are you just taking it easy, or are you trying to do 
stuff for next season? 
 
A lot of times they go out and get jobs.

Go out and get a real job. 
 
When I come off the road, the last time, I was with the VFW and 
everything, but I did a tent sale one time. I put up a big top and sold 
spaces for a flea market, just to do something. 
 
You didn’t put the big top up. Your husband and I did. (Laughter) 
 
No, wintertime is… 
 
But I put out flyers and stuff and it went all around. I did real good with 
it. 
 
Wintertime is our relax time, but in the same time, we practice. We 
practice a new act if we have something on our minds. We work with 
animals. We practice the horses all winter.  
 
Make wardrobe. 
 
Make wardrobe for the next year. 
 
And we do visit each other.  
 
Yes. We’re big on Thanksgivings and Christmases, because that is our 
“everybody-together” time. 
 
And we started a Showmen’s Club so we could draw other people in. 
They didn’t have anybody to visit with. 
 
And we had a great big Christmas party for the Showmen’s Club and 
invited everybody, even if they weren’t members, just to open the arms 
of—and everybody got to see each other that they hadn’t seen all year or 
whatever. 
 
And eat.

Well, of course, and eat. 
 
Yes, I still own a cotton candy machine. 
 
Yes, we all own one of those. I own three snow cone machines.

And we work the winter parades, if we want. We do other things in the 
winter.  
 
Teach the smaller kids. And Moira homeschooled her kids. They only 
went to public school how long? 
 
Well, my son started in fourth grade and my daughter, that’s now in her 
third year of college, she started in the eighth grade—public school. 
 
Public school. They were all homeschooled. 
 
I made it to the seventh. 
 
I did too. My daughter went into the eighth grade because I couldn’t find 
the books to teach her that year. They only went to a certain level, the 
books that I was teaching her out of. I couldn’t find the books for eighth 
grade so I put her in the public school. They tested her and she tested 
post high school. But she didn’t want to go up any further because she 
was afraid, she’s small. She’s short. She didn’t want to be in a big kid’s 
class and somebody not her age, so she went right into the eighth grade, 
and just went through it.  
 
Jumped from what? She went to McAlester first. 
 
Alfredo. 
 
You can only question about hard questions. 
 
Well, before you leave us, you mentioned that you’re stuck in Hugo. 
 
No, no, well it was what I said. 
 
I know, but you’ve been everywhere, you’ve seen all over the country. 
 
Many things. 
 
Many different places. I know your family’s here, but why did you come 
back to Hugo? Why do you continue to stay in Hugo? 
 
Okay. One important thing—after we divorced, my ex and I, we made 
agreement. I said, “You don’t have to work,” because she looking for 
work and I said, “Don’t worry about it, I can go and work in any circus,” 
and believe me, the funny thing is I make more money in the circus now 
than when I was performing, my knowledge. I said, “You stay there and

whatever you need, I will take care of.” Well, I took care of everything 
for more than seven years—six years, seven years—and I was in the 
circus. One day, I came back here and my son, he told me, he said, 
“Dad, I see you two weeks a year. Only two weeks in a year. Why don’t 
you look at something in the city and work there?” You know what? I 
said, “Okay.” He said, “I play soccer, I do this, and I want to you go 
with me because you’re a good player. You play soccer very well and I 
want to work with you.” He didn’t tell me exactly, but he wanted to be 
close to me. I’m addicted to my kids. I love them with all my heart. I 
love my kids with all my heart, and I said, “Okay, I’m going to try to see 
what’s going on.” 
 
The first year was easy. I got money in my pockets, a lot of money from 
past years. I got it, and I spent it and I spent it and spent it and I spent. I 
said, “I’m going to find some job,” but in Hugo, you don’t find anything 
good. So finally, the good thing is, if they need a welder to weld 
something, I’ve got a lot of friends and they know me, they’ll call me. If 
they need a driver, I’ve got a CDL, commercial [driver’s license]. I can 
drive big semis. I can do this, handyman. What do you need? Paint the 
house? I’ll do it. So this is what I do to survive in this time. But it was 
for one thing only, my kids. Now, my kids now, they’re grown up. Some 
are already married, they go out. My daughter is in college in 
Massachusetts. My son is going to go out so Hugo, bye-bye. 
 
See, I come from different roots, guys. A lot of people say, “You are 
very crazy, stupid Alfredo, because you still”—this is the truth, they say, 
“You still help your ex. You still help your kids. Your kids are grown 
up. You still give and take care of them. You’re still paying lights, that, 
that, and that. Well. Wait a minute. That woman lived with me for thirty 
years. She’s the mother of my kids and I love my kids. I remember my 
grandmother told me, she said, “Never marry by the church because if 
you marry by the church you’re going to be married for the rest of your 
life, even if you separate.” Unfortunately, I was married by church. So 
I’m a good Catholic. I can’t kill her, but I can divorce her. I live under 
the law of United States and that is why I’m here. But let me tell you 
something, I got just two years over here. This is my second year. Tell 
me, which city of the United States you want to know and I can tell you. 
What you want, what is the best place to eat, what is best place to sleep. 
 
What’s your favorite one, then? 
 
Honestly? My favorite? 
 
Yes. 
 
You don’t even know. Chicago.

Chicago, to me, it’s Chicago and Baltimore. Baltimore is clean. 
 
In the summer, right? 
 
So nice. 
 
Yes.  
 
Well, yes, unfortunately. I work with Ringling Brothers Barnum and 
Bailey for two years and we traveled in big cities, beautiful cities. Also, 
for many years we traveled in the United States. Practically, forty years 
in United States so I know every city and here and Alaska, Hawaii, what 
else? Every state in the mainland and every city. 
 
Yes, but you want to be around your own kind, which is Hugo, 
California, or Florida. (Laughs) That’s it. 
 
Well, here is a lot of friends—and Las Vegas. 
 
Yes, Las Vegas, too. 
 
Now, Las Vegas is like, everybody wants to live in Vegas 
 
And why do you want to be around your own kind? 
 
Because some people don’t know how, we talk to them, they don’t 
understand us. They don’t believe us because we’ve lived a different 
life. You know what I mean? 
 
The place I worked, in the place I worked, I worked with like twenty 
people… 
 
Like, it took me two years to answer a phone. I mean, that’s not normal. 
 
…and you know how many friends I got over there? None. Everybody 
goes outside to smoke a cigarette, I go straight to my job, go out to 
lunch, sleep a little bit in my truck, eat something, go back, and come 
back. But if these people were circus people, I could talk to them about 
trapeze or something.  
 
I understand because I know what it is. But some of the things I’ve told

my friends, they don’t believe you because it’s sort of unbelievable—
like fire-eating. I’m a fire-eater. Well, “Yeah, sure.” But whatever I say, 
I can back it up. You know what I mean?  
 
But this is the truth. 
 
It’s hard to talk to regular people in the first place. 
 
And now if you see my friends on Facebook, it’s the circus people, just 
the circus people. We talk for hours, do nothing. 
 
Do you think the towners in Hugo are open to you all? 
 
Not really. 
 
Not really. 
 
They don’t understand us. 
 
Not really. I came to Hugo because when I was married, my ex-mother-
in-law, she was sick and we lived in San Antonio, Texas. My ex-wife 
said, “I’ve got to go see my mom because…” and so we came over here 
and we parked in her place. That’s it, right there. Then, we worked and 
we came back, we went out, and we made our own circus. The name of 
my circus was Circus Del and we worked for three years until Katrina, 
the hurricane, put me out of business. They caught me close to Jackson, 
Mississippi, and I was right there. I spent money and I don’t know, 
probably because I was a good person, because, see, we don’t work for 
weeks because we can’t go out. There’s no gasoline to put in the trucks. 
We had to go to someplace to the National Guard Armory and they gave 
us water, ice, or something. I had to pay my workers, my performers, 
even if you hadn’t worked. One day, my daughter, she was my treasurer, 
she said, “Dad, we don’t have any more money. Think of what you’re 
going to do.” I said, “Go back to Hugo.” That’s what I did. I gave one 
guy $200, the other one another $300. I had to give them something, 
because we, in the circus, you’re my family. 
 
Yes. 
 
I had to give them something for that, at least to drive 200 miles. The 
good Lord helped me, and we came back to Hugo. We tried to reopen 
again, but one of my daughters said, “No, Dad, I don’t want to go in the 
circus because I want to be a mom.” My other daughter, Claudette, she 
was here. She was my promotion head of the circus, her and her 
husband, and they wanted to divorce. They couldn’t do the job good 
because of that. So I got everything against me. My divorce, my family,

my circus, the Lord probably, the bad weather, and I said, “I think that’s 
it.” I closed the circus for good. I still have my little winter quarters 
somewhere. Once in a while, I go to see the garbage that’s the trailer. I 
decided and then I go to Ringling, Barnum and Bailey. For years, and 
later on, somebody else called me and said “I need a tent master,” I said, 
“I’m ready. I know how to set up every tent in the world: Italian, 
Japanese, Mexican, Americans.” 
 
How did you learn how to be a tent master? 
 
How you do it, when you’re kids… 
 
You had to do it. 
 
It’s just hard work? 
 
When you’re a kid, and your father said… 
 
Drive the stake. 
 
…“Drive your stake and pull this guy line all the way to there because 
over there, there is going to be one stake. It has to be exactly what it is.” 
But I don’t know, count, steps. “This is the long, this is the right. This is 
what da, da, da…” 
 
I think the men of the circus got the worst because we had to do 
everything. 
 
That’s what I learn. I tell you… 
 
And the girls got to perform and the easier jobs.  
 
But I think, I started to be a circus owner when I was eleven years old 
because my father was not a circus person, my mom, yes, but not my 
father. My father, after my mom died, had two kids, me and my sister. 
She lives in Las Vegas, lives with my grandmother, my mom’s mother 
and is in the circus. I didn’t meet my father until I was thirty, thirty-
three, years old. Because my father was like a politician in Mexico, in 
my mind, I wanted to be like my father. Smart. I didn’t want for, one 
day, my father to see me and think I’m stupid. So I started to learn every 
book I got, bibles—any kind of bibles—Buddha, anyone. I learned it, I 
learned it, I learned it. Then when my family, my brothers, they knew 
how I got so much knowledge, they put me in charge of the problems in 
the circus. In Mexico, with money, you can buy anything. 
 
Then I bought a little carnet, we call them. I’m part of one of the biggest

parties, like in the United States, democrats and you know what I mean? 
But it wasn’t in the power at that moment, and also, I said, “I’m a 
lawyer,” because the name of the circus was Circus Beckman. Then, if 
you got a problem I would call and say, “Excuse me, it’s me, Mr. 
Alfredo Beckman, the lawyer. Alfredo Beckman. I’m the owner of the 
circus. What’s happening? What problem is over there?” Well, they tell 
me the problem, and I say, “Okay. Tomorrow, I’m going to fly from 
Mexico City to there.” I was lying because I was in the same city. 
“Okay,” I said, “Tomorrow I’m going to be there. I’m going to fly 
tonight and I’m going to meet you guys.” Let me tell you something, 
you know how many times I took the circus out of the problems, people 
out of the jail? Because I know the law in my country and I don’t let the 
lawyers and I don’t let the judge talk, because I want to be like my 
father. The last time when I see my father, my daughter Claudette was 
ready to be born in 1982. He’s dead. 
 
Claudette will be proud you remembered that. (Laughs) 
 
See, here, still here probably, I’m nobody. In Mexico, probably, I can 
still be Mr. Alfredo Beckman. (Laughs) People remember me. But all 
the stuff, I give thanks to the circus for. The circus makes you—if you 
got in an accident and somebody dies in the accident, you had to go and 
talk with the press, with the policemen, with the law, and then put 
everybody out. With talk and money, then everything is done. I 
sometimes, I said, “I miss all the stuff.” What’s in Hugo? There isn’t—
my kids and her. Probably, we’ll live for many years and costumbre 
[habit], probably. I give you the word costumbre so you can… 
 
Well, we asked Billy and Alfredo about how they felt about people in 
Hugo, the towners. Do you feel like they’re accepting of you all? 
 
Now they are. I went to school here and I still run across people that I 
went to school with. They treat us a lot different. 
 
Most of the children in school are good friends with at least one circus 
kid. It’s a small town and from way back when, they’ve known the 
circus kids. Now they’re grown-ups and now they’re all… 
 
Billy was born here and we lived at the fairgrounds in wintertime. My 
mother was there, my dad was out on another circus that he took out, 
and that was…

But the name of the circus was D-O-N, E., as in an initial—K-E-R-R. It 
was like an inside joke.  
 
Yes, they called it Don E. Kerr and my dad said he called it that because 
it was a bunch of shit. (Laughter) And that’s a true story. 
 
They opened in Broken Bow.  
 
The guy that they had selling tickets and everything, he decided he was 
tired of it and he somehow stole the money and took it with him and left 
them some tuna fish or something for Thanksgiving dinner. (Laughs) 
That was Happy Hanks. 
 
I don’t know Happy Hanks.  
 
That was… 
 
That was before your time.  
 
There you go. 
 
He was off of Tex Carson. He did a long time ago, but there are a lot of 
funny things that went on. 
 
But they were trying to make a buck to feed the family in the wintertime. 
My dad had a bad habit, there was a grocery store here called Kay’s 
Grocery. They’d run a tab and then go out in the summertime and work 
and pay it off. Well, we all had to go work and help pay this off. Then 
we were broke for about two or three months because we were paying 
off the grocery bill. And I hated it.  
 
Butter was a dime, bread was a dime. 
 
What?

Butter was a dime, bread was a dime. Something else was a dime. 
Actually, the circus trailer park was right down the road here, about 
three blocks. 
 
Where that salvage yard is. 
 
Momma would send one of us, usually me, because I was shy and 
always stayed at home, “Go get some butter, Terry Lee.”  
 
What? 
 
“Go get some butter,” and I’d have two dimes, one for bread, one for 
butter. But somehow I always lost one dime, but I always brought back 
the butter. I don’t know how I did that.  
 
It’s that ten cents worth of candy you used to eat. 
 
Probably. 
 
Well, when we were in Dallas in the wintertime, we lived in the bus, a 
big bus, at that time. Momma would always send me to the store for 
milk and at that time, there were no cardboard cartons. I would bring this 
milk back and just when I got to the trailer, I’d drop that milk and break 
it, and I had to make the second trip to go get it again. 
 
Thinking of the family and how the town treats us, I divorced and 
moved back in 2006. I met a man and we started dating, and he said, 
“You said you used to be in the circus,” and I said, “Yes,” and he said, 
“Did you know the girl they used to call Tippy Toes?” Well, come to 
find out, he knew all my circus friends in the winter, where I knew them 
in the summer, ten or fifteen people. He knew every one of them and 
that just helps our relationship because he can talk circus. He was around 
it. It’s very interesting to me. 
 
Are you talking about Schuler? 
 
Yes. But he named off every one of them, “Oh yes, I know what 
happened to her, where she’s at…” and it was pretty neat.  
 
Favorite circus owner to work for? 
 
Dory Miller and he’ll always be my favorite. I said if I ever got on Who 
Wants to be a Millionaire, I was going to use him for a lifeline because 
he knew everything and never forgot anything. He has always been a 
great man for me. Who was yours?

I’m trying to think. 
 
I’m about the only one that fought with him. 
 
I’m trying to figure out which one paid me the most. (Laughs) 
 
Well, it wasn’t the Ringling Show.  
 
No, I didn’t go—well, I went on concession on Ringling.  
 
Ringling Brothers Circus paid the worst salaries in show business 
because you had the, “On the Ringling Show.” 
 
Ted Carter, I never got paid, so… (Laughter) I couldn’t say that. I 
worked for family. 
 
I’ve hauled elephants for Dory. I’ve made trips for Dory. I’ve done a lot 
of stuff for Dory.  
 
She’s asking me. I know she was! (Laughter) 
 
But you can’t think of an answer. 
 
Oh, I can think of all kinds of show owners that I worked for. Every one 
of them was good in their own way, I guess. I didn’t ever not get along 
with any of them.

crushed by the elephants?

Not really. 
 
No, actually, I got… 
 
Beat up. (Laughs) 
 
Beat up is what I was going to say, actually. Beat up. I was working and 
we were in a park in Canada, and she always told me to stay away from 
this one elephant because she would swing her trunk. Well, I stayed 
away from it. It was the other elephant that I should have worried about.  
(Laughs) She would raise—because we used to do mounts where they 
raise their leg and you get on the back of the elephant or you stand on 
their leg, depending on what trick you were going to do. The elephant 
was real fast about raising its leg and I was used to it, but I guess I let 
my guard down one day and she raised it, knocked my feet out from 
under me—because I was holding the head piece—knocked my feet out 
from under me, and I fell back. They used great big railroad ties as the 
ring curb so when I did that, it knocked me out cold. This elephant 
proceeded to take her trunk, pushing me against this railroad tie while I 
was unconscious. Well, next thing I knew I was in an ambulance going 
to the States, Burlington, Vermont, and I had four breaks and fractures 
around my eye and I broke here. (Gestures) 
 
Knocked your teeth out. 
 
Got my ear cut in the back. I mean, it was all minor stuff, but that’s what 
she was talking about. I hadn’t thought of that in years. It’s something 
that’s just in the past, I guess. But yes, that was my accident, per se. But 
it wasn’t the elephant’s fault, either. It was something that happened, but 
yes, they paid all the medical bills. 
 
Well, I worked elephants. I had worked elephants, pulling tent and stuff 
like that on George Matthews Circus and Sells and Gray, when I was 
young. I wasn’t afraid of the elephants. I respected them, and you know 
what to do and what not to do. They weren’t bad elephants, then. But 
I’ve been on shows with bad elephants. One year, over on Gopher 
Davenport’s show, I took approximately fifteen guys to the hospital that 
this one elephant had—he would pick them up and slam them down on 
the ground on their butt and then rake them. Oh, my lands, that was 
terrible! 
 
Was that Boo? 
 
No, it was Tommy.

See, we knew these elephants, you knew that Kay was a good elephant, 
Barbara was a good elephant, and you knew all these. 
 
They had reputations like people.  
 
But weren’t Barbara and the others, aren’t they the runners? 
 
Yes, they’d take off, but I was never on there when they took off. 
 
No, but if they took off, you better just get out of the way. 
 
Yes, they were the kind that—and they ran together. Most of the time it 
was my friend, Lucy [Loyal], right? You met Lucy. We talked about this 
the other day, where she would grab on the wire going out the back door 
because it was the back entrance. They’d take off out the back and she’d 
just grab one of the guy lines on the way out and they’d keep on going 
and she’d just slide down the rope and go on. 
 
And one of the kids, they’d run between the trailers, and you could feel 
your trailer doing this (gestures swaying motion), “Oh, there’s an 
elephant loose.” I mean, you just, you knew, even when you were little, 
you knew. 
 
I remember the time that I was getting laundry out and going in the 
trailer with it, and somebody hollered about the elephants running. I 
threw the laundry and jumped in the trailer! The laundry went 
everywhere. (Laughs) 
 
Yes, but the elephants do have their own names and their own 
personalities and their own reputations. 
 
All girls? 
 
Yes, you’ll learn all that. 
 
No. 
 
No? Well, the ones you named off were female names. 
 
Well, Tommy was the boy. He was an African elephant and he was a 
bad seed. 
 
Right, but African elephants do not have a brain like the Indian

elephants. African elephants, you can teach them something one day, 
you better re-teach them tomorrow before the show, because they forget. 
They’ve got a smaller brain. Then you’ve got swamp elephants and 
you’ve got over the land, like desert elephants. They are the ones that go 
in the swamp and are long-legged. The desert elephants are short legged. 
 
Didn’t know that, did you? 
 
No.  
 
Yes, I rode an elephant. The ones I was telling you about were Gee Gee, 
Roxie, and Michelle, were the three elephants’ names up there.  
 
And in real life, in people life, Gee Gee and Roxie were sisters.  
 
Yes. The owners of these elephants, one lady was Gee Gee, her sister 
was Roxie, and I think they have a… 
 
And I live in Mugsy’s, the other sister’s house. (Laughs) 
 
Did you all have show names? Stage names? 
 
No. 
 
No. It’s just her. 
 
You just go by your names? 
 
That’s like my great-grandson. His name is Balian Valentine. Well, he’s 
lived here and he is Balian Curiel, now. 
 
In his own little head. Don’t tell him any different. 
 
He’ll tell everybody, and he’ll fight with you over that.  
 
And he made the teacher. 
 
No, we were introduced mostly by… 
 
His name… 
 
Well, Vicky and my sister and Moira had an act. They were Rebecca and 
La Moira, just because they probably did four or five other acts in the 
show, trying to stretch it out.

Balian told me, “Look at the back part here.”  
 
I told you, he’s the only blonde on there. 
 
Five-year-old grandson. 
 
What did he tell you? 
 
I said, “Well, where are you?” He was in a float last week and I go, 
“Where are you?” I said, “I can’t…” there was a bunch of little kids, 
“Which one are you?” He says, “Look at this part right here. That’s me 
right here. See this part?” (Laughter) 
 
He had on a white shirt and all the rest of the kids are Indian or 
whatever, they’re all dark. So he’s the only blonde on there.  
 
He was the cowboy.  
 
Well, if you didn’t work for the circus and you could be anything in the 
world you wanted to be, what would you be? 
 
I always wanted to be a nurse or a stewardess, an airline stewardess 
when I was young. 
 
Well, I had, one time… 
 
That was my thing. I wanted, I thought, “Oh, that would be cool, 
because I can still travel everywhere!” Or a nurse, I don’t know why I 
ever thought of a nurse. 
 
Well, I, this one time, had an opportunity to be a buyer for exotic 
animals, but I had to give up my child to do it, let them stay with Mother 
or something, put them in their custody, because I’d be flying 
everywhere. So I didn’t do that. I’ve done public relations. I’m a 
booking agent. 
 
That’s not what she was asking. What would you like to be? 
 
Well, I’m trying to decide. I don’t have any… 
 
It’s a little late, now. You’re seventy. (Laughter) 
 
I wanted to write a book at one time and I probably still could, about the 
elephants that escaped here and everything, and let me tell my story.

Well, what was your favorite position in the circus? What did you like 
most? 
 
I liked public relations and meeting the big wigs of the cities and talking 
to them, and I was able to talk to them. I was what you call a fixer. I did 
weight scales for D.R., but I could talk to people, and I liked doing it. It 
was a challenge. I need something with a challenge. 
 
What are weight scales? 
 
Where the trucks go through. I fixed them to where the trucks wouldn’t 
have to stop and you do that by sliding a little envelope across the 
counter and they go by. That’s just the way they did it. If they do get 
stopped, if the cops stop somebody, you keep them from going to jail. 
I’ve gone to court for guys that they were going to put in jail for no 
driver’s license or suspended license. Talked them out of it. And I was 
good at it. 
 
The fixer.  
 
What I wanted to do, I wanted to run away from the circus and join a 
home, which I eventually did. I got married and raised exotic animals 
most of my married life. 
 
Wow. 
 
In the broad range. 
 
And sold to pet stores, zoos, African hunts. 
 
What kind of animals? 
 
Well in a broad range. 
 
Emu, ostrich, red kangaroos, wallabies, pot-bellied pigs, miniature cows, 
miniature horses, monkeys. Any kind of bird you can think of, from a 
cage bird to swans and peacocks. 
 
Here in Hugo, or somewhere else? 
 
No, I lived outside of Fort Worth. 
 
But in a general thing, we’ve all done something, kind of distant related 
to what we did.  
 
They would know everybody.

you like they don’t believe what you’re saying.  
 
I think my opinion is, circus fans, we couldn’t do without them because 
they do keep people’s minds busy with the circus. They promote it. 
 
On the towner side? 
 
If it wasn’t for circus fans, I think show business wouldn’t be the same, 
now. 
 
There’s a Circus Report that used to come out of California. 
 
Oh, that was another thing on that paper, on one side it says, 
“CircuSpace.” Have you been there? 
 
Yes, I have actually. It’s like a MySpace for the circus world.

When we were all kids, mostly.  
 
We’d tell stories on each other then laugh. That’s about it, “Do you 
remember so and so…” 
 
Like we did out here last weekend with my niece. 
 
My brother that lives in Granbury, he’s pretty funny. He tells a lot of 
stories. He had trained horses and dogs and his wife did foot juggling. 
Our grandfather, great-grandfather did foot juggling. He was ninety-
something years old, foot juggling in front of…Safeway? 
 
A dime store, some dime store in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. 
 
Then my Grandma Marie, when she got off the road, she did 
demonstrations back in stores, like for vegetable deals and she’d show 
them off and sell that stuff. I’ve got a picture of them doing that.  
 
That’s an old one too. 
 
But it’s just a lot of stuff. 
 
Want to hear a funny story about polygamy? 
 
Why not? 
 
My father’s mother, Grandma Marie, we were raised believing that she 
was adopted out of Sun Valley, Idaho. Well, after I started doing 
research, I found out her mother was one of three sisters and there were 
forty-eight children amongst them. She never knew that. I mean, I was 
shocked, totally shocked. 
 
If she did, she never told anybody. 
 
No, she didn’t know it. My dad died in Bagley, Iowa, and after he 
passed, I found out his family founded that town. He didn’t know this. 
It’s just a weird way where you go back where you come from, I think. 
It’s very strange. I wish he did know. It’s very strange about the 
polygamist.  
 
Well, Grandma Marie always said that she was part of the Dalton 
family. 
 
Well, I have pictures that say Dalton on them. 
 
My father looked exactly like Emmitt Dalton.

So did my dad, isn’t that funny? (Laughter) 
 
Anyway… 
 
That was good, wasn’t it? 
 
That was good.  
 
When the Daltons robbed the drugstore in Coffeeville, Kansas, my 
grandfather was up on the roof of the drugstore roofing it when they 
robbed that bank. Right after that’s when he got Grandma Marie and 
tried to marry her everywhere. And she was young.  
 
We’re supposed to be related to the James Gang on my mother’s side, 
the Dalton Gang on my father’s side. 
 
Well, Grandma Faye was married like thirteen times.  
 
That’s not documented. 
 
Well, she was. 
 
She may have been married but I don’t think she ever got divorced.  
 
Anyway, she’s… 
 
I really don’t. I think she just kept getting married and married and 
married. 
 
No, she was married to that lion trainer, Stokes. He married my 
grandmother and she was pregnant with my mother, but my mother’s 
father’s named Blondie Ward. 
 
And he was an all-around cowboy from 1950-something. 
 
And she went in behind the seats. My brother looks just like him. Barney 
looks just like him.  
 
Bill looks like my dad and my brother Barney looks like my mother’s 
father, exactly to the T. 
 
I mean, you couldn’t tell the difference if you looked at a picture. What 
else is there in the background? Harry James is our half-great uncle. He 
was the world’s greatest band leader and trumpet player. He had his own 
band.

He had a dance band, but he never would admit being in the circus until 
he got later in years. 
 
Way older. Then stigma, maybe, but you can type his name in anywhere 
and it’ll tell his circus background. 
 
Well, you all are living here in Hugo. You could live anywhere. Why do 
you live here? 
 
I don’t know, I met my husband and he was from Hugo. I went to school 
here. It’s just a convenient place to live. It always was cheaper than the 
other places to live, but now it’s not. The weather was good. 
 
I moved back here, I was married—oh, I don’t know how long I was 
married—thirty-something years, longer than you [to Moira], a little bit 
longer than you. 
 
I’m still working on mine. 
 
Because this is where family lived and my retired friends. I can still go 
anywhere in the United States or wherever I want to go, but this is where 
I choose to live. I have friends that I’ve known all my life, like Lucy and 
the Rawls. We were raised with the Rawls. 
 
We’ve got a sister in Michigan and she says when something happens to 
her husband, she’s moving back here to be next to us. And the sister in 
Florida, they’ll all move back. My mother moved here and died here. 
 
That would be a scary thing. All of us back in the same… 
 
We’d sit around and laugh all the time. (Laughter) We can’t get together 
without having a laugh party. You ought to have seen them the other 
night out here, acting like… 
 
At one o’clock in the morning, Moira and her daughter, Claudette, my 
niece, her momma’s in Florida, which is also circus people. We sat out 
there until one o’clock and laughed so hard, and I haven’t done that in 
years.  
 
Well, besides that… 
 
Just telling old stories.

…they had water fights and… 
 
Oh, yes. No, Moira had the water fights. We were running. (Laughter) 
 
Acting like a kid. 
 
What was your favorite city that you traveled through? 
 
I like Granite, Oklahoma.  
 
That is a pretty place. Well, I’d like to live in Langston. 
 
It sticks out. The first time I was there, when I was maybe ten years old, 
the show I grew up on was very small, played very small towns, smaller 
than Hugo. My brother-in-law would always educate me on that area, 
and I went there on vacation after I was married because I wanted to go 
back and see. It’s still my favorite city or town. You ever been there? 
 
No. 
 
It’s awesome.  
 
They’ve got a big high-security prison there. 
 
Yes, they do now. The town is flat, but right at the end of the town on 
the main street is this huge mountain, Granite Mountain. It’s just 
uplifting. It’s just real neat. 
 
I liked it in Alaska because I always said being up there, you’re as close 
to God as you’re going to get without being dead. It was beautiful 
country, open spaces. It was really something. But it would just take 
your breath away. Unsettled, drive around the corner, you might see a 
deer, or—I mean, a moose or a bear. In fact, I did meet a grizzly bear on 
the road. I stopped and just watched him because he was so big. But I’d 
like to live there. My favorite, another favorite place is I like the Ozarks. 
I always wanted to be in the Ozarks. 
 
Did someone ever tell us about making the nut? 
 
No.  
 
Oh, you want me to tell you about making the nut? 
 
Please, yes. 
 
Well, when the circus, back then, years ago, would come to a town, they

wouldn’t have a lot of money. They were in wagons and the elephants 
walked. They’d get to a town that they were going to set up in, they 
would take the wagon nuts off the hubs of the wheels, and they would 
take them to town to the mercantile store and put them up there where 
they could get their merchandise—more or less pawn them. They would 
get all the merchandise and feed and everything that they needed. Then, 
the store people would keep the nuts because you knew they wouldn’t 
go anywhere without these. They’d go back to the lot, work their shows 
or trade horses, mostly, is what they were doing. They would make the 
nut and they’d go back to the store, pay the guy off, and redeem the nuts 
and put them on the wagons and go to the next spot. They did this all the 
time. But the show was more or less a front for trading horses, to draw 
the people in. They’d make their money off of trading horses.  
 
Well, in today’s time, how do they do that from town to town? Like 
animal feed and stuff? Do they have to…? 
 
Well, no, it’s cash money. 
 
As you go? 
 
They would give a buyer, a purchasing agent, “X” amount of dollars, 
like, “Here’s $200, go get feed,” and you’d go back and check in your 
bills. If you needed more money, he’d give you some more. You’d go 
spend that and bring back the bills. It’s just a continuous thing because 
you’re feeding a lot of people and your animals. 
 
And there’s a lot more money in it now than there was back then. 
 
They don’t trade horses, now. They give them a show. 
 
Well, in the cookhouse, would the menu vary very much? 
 
Well, it depends on the length of the move, to whether they had time to 
do certain things or if you had a day off, you might get something better 
that cooks longer. 
 
Sunday was chicken, mostly, fried chicken. 
 
A lot of times it was just bologna and sandwiches, bologna, cheese, and 
JELL-O or something like that. 
 
My momma’s the best cook and everybody will tell you my momma’s 
the best cook—for cooking real meals. She sure did.  
 
But it’s all an experience. I mean, it takes special types of people to do

this because you don’t know what’s going to happen. You’ve got to be 
ready for anything.  
 
And you’re moving constantly.  
 
Yes, just like Billy was saying. You don’t get very much sleep and if 
their truck was broke down, we’d have to go after it and still do 
whatever we did during the day, but you had to do it on the spot. If it 
was midnight, two o’clock in the morning, or six o’clock that evening, 
you had to be ready to roll. 
 
Would you do it all over again? 
 
Yes. Yes, I have no regrets. There are some things I would’ve done 
maybe a little different, but I don’t regret any part of my life. 
 
Well, living in such small quarters most of the year, you’d have to be 
very organized? 
 
You have to get along. 
 
You can’t collect much? 
 
No, we never had much. 
 
Well, no, you don’t collect much and you also learned if you take it out, 
put it back. Because all the clutter, there’s a place for everything and 
everything in its place. 
 
And if you left it out and had a mom like ours, it was gone. She would 
find a new home for it. 
 
Well, you had to do the dishes, keep them done up. When we started out, 
you didn’t have a lot of places to haul water so you had to do it 
accordingly. There are a lot of times that we would put a tub of water 
outside and let it warm to wash up in or wash dishes in. 
 
My mom only—my mom, not yours [joking to her sister Faye] only had, 
everybody had their plate. She didn’t have extra. We didn’t have extra 
cups or glasses to get dirty. I mean, she had that many, and I don’t even 
remember having glasses. We had a cup. 
 
Well, plastic. Well, plastic wasn’t out then. Not as bad. But I think 
Melmac, when it came out. We never used paper cups or paper plates. 
They cost too much. No paper towels.

They weren’t even any paper towels. 
 
Well, that’s what I say. We had toilet paper.  
 
Where would you do your laundry from town to town? 
 
Well, you go to the Laundromat. 
 
Or by hand. 
 
Where this Highland store is, down here, that used to be a laundry all 
along there, a big laundry. You’d take your number three washtubs full 
of clothes. When I was pregnant with Moira, I was slinging them in and 
out of that station wagon for Momma so she wouldn’t lift them because 
she was more pregnant than I was. See, my brother was born in October 
and Moira was born in November. 
 
Bunch of hillbilly circus people. (Laughter) 
 
But now I know how to make lye soap. I can make wine. I’m a good 
cook. I bake for the club and fix stuff. So really you just fall into it. 
You’ve got to do what you’ve got to do. And I sew, I crochet, I 
embroidery. What else? 
 
My grandmother Faye used to crochet tights and sell them for three 
dollars a pair. Can you imagine crocheting a pair of tights? 
 
When my husband was in the hospital, I made macramé baskets, 
crocheted them for plants, all kinds of stuff. I’ve done everything, 
worked in Dan River Cotton Mill. 
 
Been a waitress. 
 
Let’s see, I was a waitress in Shawnee. 
 
A&W Root Beer. 
 
And down in Alabama. And that’s where I worked in the cotton mill and 
I learned, see, that’s where my challenge comes in. I’ve got to have a 
challenge. Well, you had to learn to do so many looms, to get up there 
high. Well, when I learned to keep all of the looms rolling, we made 
sheets, I quit my job and went to work somewhere else because I did it. 
That’s all I wanted to do.  
 
You like that challenge.

Yes, and I guess that’s the reason I messed around working elephants 
and stuff. The challenge was there. I just wanted to see if I could do it. I 
went back and got my GED. I wanted to do it. Not for any reason, just 
for me. 
 
That self-satisfaction. 
 
Yes. But I enjoyed it all. Like I say, I’ve done a lot of stuff, too. Only 
thing I regretted is my son dying as young as he was. He wasn’t but 
thirty-seven. Then I married Gus, he’s got a boy that’s, Stevie’s birthday 
was on the twenty-fourth and Billy’s birthday was February second so 
they were that far apart. Well my son, when they were in school, I had to 
take Gus’s son and put him in after-school tutoring because he was 
having trouble in school. My son would get mad because he couldn’t go. 
He didn’t need to go. He was pretty smart in show business, too. Well-
liked, but he didn’t make it. I still miss him today, and he died in 2000. 
 
And you will.  
 
You saw my mother’s tombstone out there [Showmen’s Rest Cemetery], 
didn’t you? 
 
Sure did.  
 
Well, my niece and my son are buried in the grave with her because she 
always wanted to take my son—she always said if she ever went to 
Hawaii, she wanted my son to go with her because he liked to do all that 
running around. Tasha was the same way, wasn’t she? She liked to go 
with Tasha. How old was Tasha when she died? 
 
Twenty-seven. 
 
Twenty-seven. Anyway, we put them together so I guess they’re having 
a good time. I even miss D.R., because he was a great guy. He taught me 
a lot of things, and I’ve got to get off this subject. 
 
Well, when did you retire from the business? 
 
Well, I got sick on the road, ’88, and I had everything wrong. I was 
having a lot of trouble just staying with it. We came home and were 
tearing down houses, old houses, and I got to where I couldn’t even hold 
my head up. I had to sleep all the time. Well, I was a diabetic and that 
put the hiatus on a lot of stuff, and then I’ve got high blood pressure and 
no Thyroid, and what else? 
 
I don’t know, ditto here, diabetic, high blood pressure, eating cookies.

and you’re eating all the cookies.  
 
I know. But they’re thin. (Laughter) 
 
But it’s just getting old. Somebody’s got to do it, I guess. But I’ve 
enjoyed my life and when I married Gus, I never thought it would be 
that way, but I finally met the right guy. Him and I’ve been together ever 
since. He drove a truck for a long time, an over-the-road truck, and I 
hated every minute of it because we’d worked together so much in the 
past years. He said he didn’t know how to leave the house if he didn’t go 
to work. (Laughs) But he’s been a truck driver for thirty years. I made 
him give up his CDL so he wouldn’t go no more.  
 
He’s sitting over there doing the recliner jockey thing now. [imitates 
snoring] 
 
Well, is there anyone in this next generation, the youngest generation, 
that’s going to go into the circus or has it stopped? 
 
I don’t know. Really and truly, it is a dying art. 
 
We do have family that has children and grandchildren. 
 
Well, see, that niece and nephew of ours is going to be on America’s Got 
Talent, which their name is Flores, so… 
 
What’s their talent? What are they going to do? 
 
You know the globe of death? 
 
They ride the motorcycle, the globe of death with a motorcycle. 
 
She’s twelve and he’s eight. 
 
My son is not interested. He used to go with my family, in the summer 
for vacations and he decided he didn’t like show business. He liked 
show business, but he didn’t want to live the life.  
 
Well, Gus’s kids wouldn’t either.

Yes. 
 
Anyway, let’s see, what else I was going to tell you. I don’t know, but 
our family is Irish gypsies on one side, Danish and Swedish on the other 
side. That’s quite a combination—the partying kind and the tight kind. 
(Laughter) Now, they’ve left me to talk and I don’t have anything to say. 
(Laughter) 
 
Are your parents buried at the Showmen’s Rest? 
 
No, just my mother. My dad’s up in Bagley, Iowa. He had another wife 
and he was up there in Iowa. He died up there and he had that fast-
spreading cancer. He got sick and two weeks later he was gone. He 
called me and told me that—he always called me his number one 
daughter. He said, “Well,” he said, “I’ve decided I don’t like that 
chemotherapy and I’m not fighting it anymore,” and he was calling me 
to tell me bye. In no time, he was gone. But my mother, she lived here 
on my property in a small trailer, and she went down to watch her soap 
opera. I always cooked and she’d come up to the house to eat. I fed her 
all the time. I told Gus, I said, “Go down and get Mom,” I said, 
“Supper’s ready and she’s not coming up here.”  
 
So he goes down there, he’s going to pretend that it was real cold outside 
and he bundled up and he goes down to the trailer and he comes back 
and told me, he says, “She’s gone.” I said, “What do you mean, she’s 
gone? Where’d she go?” “No, she’s gone.” She died sitting there 
watching that soap opera. My son died watching that same soap opera, 
All My Children. I said, “Don’t put that thing on. I don’t want to die!” 
(Laughs) I never would watch soap operas, anyway. But she died very 
fast and sudden and didn’t suffer. She was sitting there like she was 
asleep. 
 
Doing what she wanted to do. 
 
She was talking to a friend of hers when she died—I mean, she died 
right after that. But she was talking to Hazel and that was it. She was 
talking to Hazel a little after four and Gus went down there at five. So 
she hadn’t been dead very long. Dr. Irwin said it was a massive heart 
attack. She wasn’t sick that day or anything. Her and I had been

shopping and having a good time. She didn’t plan on it because we got 
groceries that day. 
 
Well, you’ve seen lots of changes in the circus business. 
 
Oh, a lot of things changed. 
 
Where do you think it’s going to go into the future? Do you think people 
are still going to go to circuses? 
 
Well, they’re going to try to keep it going, but D.R.’s daughter, Dory 
Miller’s daughter [Barbara Miller Byrd], is running Carson and Barnes 
now. Her daughters are into show business. I’ve seen Geary [Byrd] and 
he’s retired and got a bunch of grandkids. Barbara Jane is just a typical 
grandma, but they try to keep it going. It’s not like it used to be. It’s a lot 
stricter now.  
 
A lot of regulations. 
 
I imagine that the one they call Kristin, she’ll probably keep it going. 
They’ve got elephants out there, endangered species [arc]. They’ve 
made Hugo. I mean, the town gets well when the show comes in because 
everybody’s got money for the winter. And that’s a lot of it. I imagine 
Mary [Rawls] had some stories, didn’t she? 
 
She did. She was great.  
 
Do you have any interesting or favorite stories of when you were 
traveling, like from point A to point B? 
 
Oh, there are so many things that happened. My husband is a jokester 
and we’d come up on a truck that was broken down, and the guy would 
come out there. And the guy always broke down in front of a liquor 
store. Anyway, this guy walks back to where we were and he says, “My 
truck’s over heated.” So Gus gets out and casually walks up there, takes 
the gas tank top off, he said “It’s full of fuel,” just dead serious. It makes 
this guy so mad!  
 
One time, I don’t know where it was at. We had a driver that stopped on 
the side of a hill in a truck that had lousy brakes, put a rock under it, to 
run back down the hill to pick up some sandwiches that a motorcyclist 
lost. He was mad because they weren’t anything but peanut butter and 
jelly. I laughed over that, and then, let’s see. That same guy, one day, 
broke down, that same truck, and the cops were there. The first thing he 
does is tell the cop—I was walking back. I heard it. Gus was driving the 
truck and I had our truck and trailer. I was walking back to see what was

the matter with this guy, why the cops had him. Just as I got up there 
where I could hear, he tells the cops he put a rock under his wheels 
because he didn’t have any brakes. I turned around and told Gus, “Go 
on. I think I’m going to have a problem.” That stuff happened all the 
time, a lot of funny stuff. (Laughs) 
 
Would you ever do shows outside of the U.S.? 
 
Oh, just in Canada. We did that because we were going to Alaska. But 
my daughter’s been to Hawaii and the little one… 
 
Singapore. 
 
Well, the one that does hula-hoops has been to Singapore, where else, 
Columbia? I can’t think of all the places she has been, but—Tokyo. 
Name the places off that Noella has been.  
 
Where Noella has been? 
 
Yes. 
 
Japan, Singapore, Chile, Hawaii. We went to Singapore and… 
 
Out of the country. 
 
Yes, I’m trying to think. We went to Hong Kong. 
 
Well, didn’t you go to Japan? 
 
Yes, we said that first.  
 
But the food. Noella hated the food, didn’t she? 
 
Oh, yes. They gave us per diem so we always had to choose where 
Noella wanted to eat. We don’t eat fish. None of my kids were really 
fish eaters. I like shrimp, that’s about it. So we would have to have—
they [Japan] do have Kentucky Fried Chicken, they have Kenny Rogers 
Roasters Chicken, McDonald’s, but the thing is, instead of potatoes, they 
always gave you rice so we’d have to do that. In Singapore, everything 
was shipped in from Australia, like the milk and the butter and all that 
stuff because it was kangaroo milk. So we didn’t have a lot of milk 
there, but they made adjustments. We had a big party in Japan. They 
knew we didn’t eat fish so they brought her a bag of potato chips.  
(Laughter) 
 
She said everything smelled like fish.

they would give her free milkshakes. She worked in a mall. They had a 
big spectacular thing going on and they’d give her all these free 
milkshakes, but she didn’t like them because they were made with the 
milk and it tasted terrible. 
 
How many hula-hoops did she do at her age? 
 
Fifty-two. 
 
Fifty-two hula-hoops.  
 
Did you ever look at the picture where he’s got his hands? It always

Noella did fifty-two hula-hoops at the same time at that age. How old

Anyway, that’s funny! 
 
How old was your daughter? 
 
She was six, I think, when we were in Japan.  
 
Well, as we get ready to wind this one down, what’s the one thing we 
should know about the circus and the circus life? 
 
It is a hard life, and if you’re prepared to work hard, you also play hard 
and fast. 
 
It’s not for everybody. 
 
No, it’s not. You’ve got a certain amount of time to do what you’ve got 
to do, and in that twenty-four hour period, you better get some sleep 
because you’re going to do it all again tomorrow. 
 
That wasn’t in one word.  
 
It doesn’t have to be one word. 
 
No, it’s not for everybody. The reason we have all survived it is because 
it was in our blood from the very beginning, and we grew up with it as a 
norm for us. And that’s why we… 
 
Both sides of the family.

“There are no people like show people.” Think of the words to that.  
 
“Like no people we know and everything about it is appealing…” 
 
You guys will need therapy when you’re done with us. (Laughter) 
 
Well, yes, probably our family, especially. But there are a lot of stories 
that we could tell. A lot of things happened. 
 
Yes, I would basically say just that. It’s not for everyone and it’s a hard 
life. You had to have not only one hundred percent, you’d better put two 
hundred percent into it because you’re going to need every ounce. 
 
You can’t go on there and fight with everybody. You’ve got to get 
along. It’s one big family and you can’t really make enemies because if 
you do, there might be fifteen more. 
 
The saying is, “Be careful who you step on, on the way up because 
you’re going to meet them coming down.” 
 
I take it it’s a pretty tight community, even though there are different 
circuses. 
 
That’s what I say. The circus takes care of your kids because everybody 
knows what everybody’s doing.  
 
[Sings] “There are no people…” 
 
That’ll be in my head all night. (Laughter)
