M:  Okay.  You know what I usually do is start by asking people about their backgrounds.  So 
maybe you could tell me first a little bit about your family, how they got to Lowell?  Do you 
know?
G:  Well my mother comes from Rhode Island and my Dad was born in Lowell.  What else do 
you want to know?
M:  Well did they um, you're French-Canadian, right?
G:  Right.
M:  So somebody came down from Canada at some point.
G:  Yeah, my grandmother.  
M:  Your father's mother? 
G:  No, my mother's mother.  
M:  Do you know why she came down?  (G:  When?)  Do you know why?
G:  I have no, no, I don't know.
M:  Because sometimes they came down to work in the mills.
G:  Yeah, I imagine that's probably what it is. 
M:  And your, that was your mother's mother?  
G:  That was my mother's mother.
M:  What about your father's family?
G:  My father's family, I don't know that much about my father's family.  They lived in Lowell 
and they owned a Lumber Yard on Gage Street I believe.  But that's a few years back.  
M:  Yeah, and where did they, what part of Lowell did they come to when they came here?
G:  Centraville.  (M: Yeah?)  We've been living in Centraville all our life.  
M:  They came right to Centraville?
G:  Yup, Centraville?
M:  Was there a French community here when they came?
G:  Yes it was.
M:  Was Saint, oh, Saint Louis was probably already here.  
G:  Yeah, yeah.  
M:  I wonder why they would come here instead of Little Canada?
G:  I don't know.  My Dad, well he came from that part.  But my mother didn't.  When they 
married well they lived in Centraville.
M:  And is this, what we're in now, is this part of Little Canada?
G:  No, no no, (T:  this is part of Centraville.) this is Centraville.  (T:  This was all, this was the 
French part of Centraville.  Like I said before, the western part was Irish and Polish)
M:  The western part of Centraville?
T:  And this part right here was French.  And that's why they migrated from Canada here, 
because you had a French parish and a French school here.  And across the bridge, Little Canada,
at that time, I'm talking about way back in the 1800's when they came in, Little Canada was full. 
So that's when they started migrating into Centraville.  The church was, Saint Louis Church 
came under Saint Jean Baptist.  It didn't come under.  And when they started to build up people 
used to have to go across the bridge to Saint Jean the Baptist from Centraville.  Had to go to 
school across the bridge if you wanted to go to the Catholic School.
M:  Did most of the people go to the Catholic School?
G:  Oh yeah.
T:  Most of them did.  Most of the French people, they're all [unclear].  So they built the school.  
They built the school and the church in Centraville.  And then my mother and father, well my 
father, my mother came from Canada.  But she migrated from Canada with her mother and 
father.  But her, there was fourteen I would say, her uncles and aunts, but they all migrated down 
together.  They didn't come down one at a time.  They all migrated together.  The whole, all the 
families all migrated all down together, all at the same time.  And they came to Centraville.
M:  So they came also right to Centraville.
T:  Right to Centraville.  
M:  Did they have relatives down here?
T:  No.  They just made their mind that they were leaving Canada for a better place to live.  And 
they all, the whole family left all together.  All the brothers and sisters, all the nephews and 
nieces all come.  Like I said, it was fourteen in the family.  My mother's, what I'm talking about 
her brothers and her father's brothers and sisters.  There was fourteen in the family.  And they all 
migrated all together.
M:  And do you know how your father's family got down here?
T:  My father was an Irishman.  
M:  Your father's Irish?
T:  Well he was born in Lowell, but his father migrated from Ireland and Scotland.  But he was 
born in Lowell.
M:  Do you speak French?
T:  Yes I speak French, went to French school.  But my mother was French.  And my father had 
to move in with the Frenchmen.  So that's why he wounded up in Centraville.
M:  Did he learn French?
T:  He could understand French, but he was a thick Irishman, he wouldn't talk French.  [All 
chuckle]  But he understood French and we talked French in the house.
M:  Oh you did?
T:  Yeah, we went to French School.  There was not English in the French School.  It was strictly 
French.  
M:  Oh when you went to the French school there was no [unclear] in English.
T:  Oh no no no.
G:  Yeah, well it was English and French.  In the morning we'd have French (T:  very little 
English), well Saint Louis.  
T:  Yeah, in Saint Louis.  I went to Saint Louis.  Very little English.
G:  Yeah, I used to.  And we'd have English in the morning, French in the afternoon.  Then the 
following month they'd be French, it'd be visa versa.  
M:  Oh French in the morning, English in the afternoon.
T:  But we got most of it was French.  Your Catechism was in French.  Your prayers were in 
French.  And most, you know,(--)
G:  Yeah, oh yeah.  That was all in French.
T:  Most of your books you took home was French.
M:  Oh I never thought of that.  The books were in French.  And you would write in French then.
G:  Oh sure.  That's why the you know (--)
M:  And what about the playground?  What would you talk as a kid?
G:  French, it'd be French.  Like me, when I left Lowell to go in the service, before I left I could 
hardly speak English.  While I was in the service they used to call me Frenchie.  And that's where
I picked it up.  (M:  In the service?)  In the service.  Over here it was all French.  
M:  Do you still pray in French?
G:  And I would write home in French.
T:  I still play in French.  I can't play in English.
M:  That's what Father Soucy said.  Most of the people want to go to Confession in French.  
G:  Oh sure!
T:  It's the same with me.  I mean my name is Burns, okay, but I always go, when I go to 
Confession it's in French.  When I go to say my prayers it's in French.  But that's the way we 
learned them.
M:  What about your children, do they speak French?
T:  Well my uh, I've got two daughters that graduated from Saint Louis Academy.  And he, he got
high honors in Saint Joseph's for French.  
M:  Is that your son?
T:  That's my son.  David.  They don't speak.  They can, you know, at home it's not like I was.  
Now I speak French to my wife so they don't know what's going on.   (T:  laughs)
M:  Is your wife French?
T:  Yes.  She's French, French descent.  Her father and mother migrated from Canada too.  
M:  So when you got married and had children, what was the language of your home?
T:  Well they went, at that time Saint Louis changed.  See, they, my daughter, they went through 
Saint Louis, all the way through Saint Louis.  But the, they had French and English, but you go 
to Saint Louis now, when the kids walk out of the door it's all English.  I mean you don't hear 
them talk French.  Like we walked out of the door you talked French from the time you walk 
through the door until you got home and everything else.  We went to the playground we taught 
French.  But you don't hear that no more.  No.  I just, I go to French school but the language ain't 
there.  
M:  What happened?
T:  I don't know.  I guess, I said they teach it, but I just think that the children just don't want to 
speak it.
G:  Yeah.  They speak English, period.
T:  And when they walk out, that's it, it's forgotten it seems like, you know?  If you stand near the
school, you hear them come out of school, you don't hear nobody talk French, no.  All English.
M:  So it's between your generation and your kids that something changed.
T:  I think it's happening in all generations.  (G:  Oh sure)  I think it's happening.  And I mean all,
like the Polish, they have their school up on High Street.  You come out of there the same way.  
They speak English, you don't hear them.  The Greeks the same way, you know what I mean.  It's
going the other way.  I guess the English language is going to be it and that's it, you know?  It's 
like here at one time.  Like this morning a little bit, but at one time you'd come here, if you didn't
talk you know, you could come it, but if you didn't understand French, forget it, you know?  
Even the bartender, [few words unclear] I used to work behind the bar.  Everybody come in like 
him, he'd be lost if they'd ask him for a drink in French.  You know?
M:  Could you ask for a drink in French?  Do you know how?
T:  No, I don't think he does.
?:  No, I don't speak French.
T:  No, that's uh (--)
M:  Now if I wasn't here would you be speaking French together?
T:  No. 
G:  No.  There's no more.
T:  Like even now, there's no more of that.  
G:  We understand and all that, we can speak it, but (--)
T:  I speak, at home I speak a lot to my wife with the two of us, you know, to get to, if we're 
alone the two of us.  I talk, we talk French a lot, you know, to keep it going.
M:  Oh, keep it going.  
T:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I know my French pretty good.
M:  Do you still get the French newspaper?
T:  Yeah.  There's no more of that.  Well we have, yeah, we have it.
G:  We have [few words unclear].  
T:  Just a, it's a monthly thing now.  Yeah.  
M:  What's the name of it?
T:  Not the LeToile.  There's no more of that.  No.
M:  Oh.  What is the name of this one?  Le France Ce Soir, or something like this.
T:  Yeah, it's put out by uh (--) 
G:  Why don't you get one.  There's one on the machine.
T:  I don't think there's one here.  It comes out.  But they pick it.  We have we'll say fifty copies 
every month.  And we put it on the machine for our members and it goes.  
M:  So they read it.
T:  Well the old ones.  They still you know.  Even my wife, I'll take one home and she'll read 
through it, you know.  
M:  Is your wife French?
G:  I'm not married.  Never married.  
M:  Why don't you tell me a little big about Centraville.  Don't be shy.  Before, I know, as I told 
you I have heard the Greeks say that there was certain sections that Greeks just didn't go in.  And
other people have said, okay, this was the Polish section of Centraville to me, this was Irish, this 
was the French.  And how did you divide up the city?   This part of the city.
T:  Well as far as this part of Centraville compared to the Western part of Centraville, like I say, 
Coburn Street seemed like the burial line.  From Coburn Street on it was French.
M:  The burial line?
T:  Well that was the line that the battle, or the line you shouldn't go.  (G:  Yeah)  And on the 
other side was Polish and French, on this side was uh (--)  I mean on the other side was Polish 
and Irish, on this side was uh, and even on the other side you had uh, let's say uh, the beginning 
of Centraville, or West Centraville, from Coburn on, was mostly and up towards Christian Hill, 
was mostly Irish and a little section around Coburn was to Lakeview Avenue, to Bridge Street, 
that was Polish.  You know.  Where the Dom Polski is, well that used to be, before the flood it 
used to be called River Street and then Front Street.  And all on that section there up to Bridge 
Street, that was Polish.  All the rest of it on the other side, like Saint Michael's and everything 
else.  That's why we got Saint Catherine's Church, that was Polish and they hung, they stood 
around.  That was their section.  They even had like the Greeks, they had their own coffee house,
the Polish did, you know.  
M:  Oh was that Dom Polski, the coffee house?
T:  No, no, before the Dom Polski.  They had a little uh, variety store, and there was a variety 
store, a couple of empty stores.  And that was for the Polish that didn't drink.  They went in there.
they played cards and everything else, you know.  That's where they went.  
M:  So they had a coffee house for those who didn't drink, and then they had, [unclear].
T:  Why I didn't know if it was a coffee house, but it was like a store, you know.  And they used 
to go in there and they used to past their time playing cards and everything like that, you know.  
Talk about Poland, I don't know.  (M:  laughs)  But then after I say uh, well then you have the 
Greenhalge School, which they, if you didn't go to Saint Louis, or you didn't go to Saint Michael,
well that was, that's the only grade school they had.  So from both sections had to use that 
Greenhalge School.  
M:  They didn't have the Varnum?
T:  That wasn't (--)  Yeah, but you didn't go to Varnum until you hit the sixth grade.  (G:  That's 
right)  That was junior high, well part of junior high when you went to Varnum.  Seventh grade I 
think it was.  I think it was the seventh grade.  Before that everybody in Centraville came to the 
Greenhalge School if you didn't go to the parochial school.  And after that you went to the 
Varnum and Lowell High School.  That's where there used to be some pretty good mix up there, 
because you had them all there.  The Polish, the French and the Irish had to go to the Greenhalge,
you know?
G:  But that French school there, there was a building to.  
T:   Well building, that was [unclear], that belonged to Saint Louis.
G:  That was French.  That belonged to Saint Louis.  That was the baby grade.
T:  That was uh, up to the third or fourth grade, you know?  (G:  Yeah)
M:  So why would some kids go to Saint Louis and some to Greenhalge?
T:  Well Greenhalge was the public school, and Saint Louis was actually, Saint Louis was just for
the parish.  Just like Saint Michael's, they had the eighth grade school, it was strictly for, you had
to be a parishioner to go there.  If you wasn't a parishioner you couldn't go to Saint Louis.  Now 
you can, but at that time you couldn't.  You had to be a parishioner to go to school.  And a lot of 
people, like my father, (G:  then you had to pay too) like my father and mother, they got married.
My father was Irish and my mother was French.  Now I have some brothers, they started in Saint
Louis, but they never finished them.  They went to the Greenhalge, they went to Varnum, go on 
to Lowell High, you know?  They just couldn't cope with the learning with French and Irish.  
They just, I don't say cope, I guess they didn't want to.  But they could speak French [unclear]. 
M:  Oh, they still can?
T:  Oh yeah.  Well like I say, when we walk in the house, if my father wasn't there, it was all in 
French, because my uncles and aunts lived in Centraville.  And if they came in the home 
[unclear] sitting there talking French.  My father, when he first got married he lived with his 
in-laws and they couldn't even talk English.  And he couldn't talk French.
M:  He sounds like an unusual person though.  Were there many other Irish, or mixed couples?  
T:  Uh, in Centraville I don't think there was that many at that time.  Maybe on the other part, 
you know.  But he came right into the French section.
M:  What was the French section?
T:  As I say, from Coburn Street down to the Dracut line.  
M:  Is it still?
T:  Yeah.  Well yeah, we can take you around Centraville here, if you go up and down these 
streets, you'll find a lot of, if you look at the names it's mostly French, you know, on the mailbox,
or you know.  But I mean there's a lot of, not like it used to be, no, never.  (G:  You got Greeks, 
you got Polocks, Irish)  This used to be French, period.  
G:  Yeah, you got all the nationalities now that you didn't have before.  
M:  Were there any little French stores here?
T:  Oh yeah, everything was French.  All the candy stores and everyone was French.  You went 
in, you wanted something, you had to tell the candy guy behind the counter in French, you didn't 
tell him in English, you know?
M:  Do you remember the names of any of the stores?
T:  There was Beland.  There was (--)
G:  Jacques Variety Store.
T:  There was uh, across the street was (G:  Delarge) Delarge. 
G:  And Ayotte's.  Ayotte.
T:  There was (--)  And there's (M:  what about Marie's?  Is that French?) still a Market there.  
G:  The one that's across the street now?   No.
T:  There's still a market there?  
G:  That was Delarge.  
T:  There's a market there that was owned from a French generation when they came from 
Canada.  Baribeault's Market.  It's still there.
G:  Oh, that's been there for a long time.
M:  Oh, Beauregard's?
T:  Baribeault's.  Baribeault.  (M:  Oh, okay)  That's been there since uh, oh, I don't know, since 
1900's I imagine.  
G:  Well their grandfather owned that.
T:  That's what I'm saying.  That's been from generation down and still a generation going.  
M:  How do you spell that?
G:  B A R I B E A U L T, Baribeault.
M:  Oh, okay.  Oh, so that's an old time Frenchman.
T:  It's right here on W. Sixth Street.  That was handed down from generation to generation.
G:  It's still in the family today.  They're French also.  I know if you'd go over there they'd talk to 
you.  
M:  So if I went in and asked for something in French, would they know it?
G&T:  Oh sure!
G:  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  Roger I think is the name, huh?  Roger, yeah.
M:  Does their son run it now?
T:  It's uh, well the family from generation down.  He's still the same generation.  
M:  Because I mean will their kids change over now?  Will they still pass it in the family.
G:  I don't know.
T:  I don't know if his (--)
G:  Like this fellow here, I don't know now if he will or now, because they got a son that's on the 
Fire Department right now.  So.
T:  So I don't know if anybody would.  I don't know.  But that was from generation to generation,
you know.  And they made out pretty good, because to run that little store most of the brothers 
had owned a lot of property around.  Even both in Little Canada and Centraville.  They did all 
right with the store.
M:  Did you trade in any stores outside of your area?
T:  Not at the time.  There was uh, well at the time we might have had right here in Centraville, 
five markets.  And you had to trade there because they're the only ones who put you on the 
books, and you pay at the end of the week.  You know?  So if you didn't go there you had to 
choose one of them.  Of course now you talk about that.  Now you had two markets in 
Centraville here owned by Jews.  And they were, they were really good to French people.  
G:  Gordon, Gordon and Curly.
T:  Yeah, Gordon and Curly's.  And they were really good to the French people.  Uh huh.  They 
carried on the books.  And uh, were carrying, some were carrying the books for years when it 
was depression, you know.
M:  Was that here in this part?
T:  Yeah, right here.  (G: Yeah)  Right here in Centraville.  And I'm going back, they were here 
for you know, early, earlier than 1900's they were here, those two markets, you know?
M:  Food markets.
T:  Yup, and they were the biggest two around.
M:  What about clothes?  Wasn't there a Mary Sokoloff?  
T:  Oh yeah.  [Unclear].  Now it's the Lowell Provision now.  Yeah, and the other one now is a 
bicycle shop.
M:  Is Lowell Provision still the same family?
T:  No, no, that's [unclear].  No, no, not the same.  No.  
G:  She's talking about clothes.  And Russell Marchand.  
T:  Oh clothes!
M:  Yeah, did you have, there was somebody that mentioned to me Mary Sokoloff, or something.
A Jewish clothes store.
G:  In Centraville?
M:  I might have it wrong.
G:  There was a Russell Marchand.  
T:  There used to be, years ago there used to be where they go on Moody Street.  That was owned
by Jewish.  What the hell was the name of that one.  Jack?  No, no.  Schwartz?
M:  Well would they keep you on the books in the clothes store too?
T:  That one would, but on Moody Street.  I forget the name of it.  It was run by Jewish people, 
and they used to keep you on the (--)  They had working clothes for the mill people, you know, 
and shoes, big working shoes.  I even for kids, they had a, it was a pretty good store, you know?  
Clothing store.  And this club there was founded about 1900.  And it was founded by Frenchmen 
that lived in Centraville.
M:  Why?  Why did they need a club?  
T:  Well it's like anything else (G:  Just a place to gather) they need a gathering, they need a 
gathering place, you know.  In Canada, it's always a tradition that the Frenchman, well not only 
Frenchman, but I men in Canada that was the thing, they had to have a gathering place.  And they
started.  And across the street was a big complex of blocks, and they rented a little front store 
there, and they started from there.  
M:  Oh, across the street here?
T:  Yeah, across the street.  That's all torn down.  That's Central Savings Bank here.  That's where
the club originated, was from there.  Then they all got together and they started, (G:  they built 
this place) in 1900. 
G:  They used to play a lot of horse shoe in those days.  Huh?  And that was the main (T:  they 
always had softball and everything else) yeah.  
T:  Well there was no tv, no nothing, you know.  It was either making babies, or coming over here
playing cards or horse shoes.
M:  And after you have ten kids I guess you play horse shoes. 
T:  That's why, that's why we all had big families.  (T:  Now I come from a family of twelve)  
That's why they all had big families.  So that's a part of migrating from Centraville over 
[unclear].  They'd say this was a French section, so they call it a French club.  But you didn't 
have to be French to come in.  At the time it was all French, because that's all that lived in 
Centraville was French, you know?
M:  What was the first name of the club?
T:  Centraville Social.  
G:  Centraville Social. 
T:  Yup, we always stayed with it.  
M:  But it was understood that it was mostly French people. Would you ever get a Polish person 
walking into the club?  
T:  Oh sure.  Oh yeah, sure.  Like today, there's all kinds in here today.
G:  Even today.
T:  It's not just French.  Because like I say, a fellow marries someone from Centraville, he lives in
Centraville.  Then he comes down here, you know?  It's the only club around here.  You can 
always go to the East End, or you go to the Dom Polski, or something, by I mean right along this 
section here that's the only club.  So you know, if you live around here you come to the 
Centraville Social.  
M:  Who comes here?
T:  Oh, all kinds.  I mean all, we have uh, I don't know, (--)
M:  Is it men and women?  (T:  huh?)  Is it mostly men?
G:  Oh yeah, men, period.  But there's women that does come, but very few.  
M:  You probably have functions once in awhile for the wives.  
G:  Yeah we do.  Not for the wives, for the men.  Like New Years we probably run a little party 
or something like that.  And the club pays for that. 
M:  And that's for husband and wives, or just the men?
G:  Just the men, but some of the wives does, they come down.  But we, we don't stop them.  
M:  And you open at 9:00 in the morning.  
G:  9:00 in the morning, (M:  When do you clothes) till 1:00 in the morning.  l:00, l:00 in the 
morning.  
M:  You're opened 9:00 a.m. till l:00 a.m., everyday?  
G:  Yup.
T:  How about Sunday?
M:  Sunday you're closed?
G:  Sunday (--)
T:  No, but I mean we can't open up at 9:00 in the morning.  You know, they open up at ll:00 in 
the morning.  
G:  Yeah, Sunday is the only time.  Sunday it's from ll:00 in the morning, till ll:00 at night.  
That's the only time.  That's the only day that (--)
T:  We got lifetime members, that's over 65 years old.  And we have a hundred and thirty-three in
here.  Over 65 years old they become lifetime members, so we got a hundred and thirty-three of 
them in here.  So.
M:  Tell me, do you have any idea what a general number of your membership is?
T:  Yeah, I just told you.  
G:  I would say about 400.
T:  Then we got 500 in one, that'd be 634 members.
M:  What do you have to do to be a member.?
T:  Well over here you're suppose to more or less try to be a social member.  You come in, you try
to live in Centraville, or you don't have to, or if you have a relative, but mostly in good standing, 
you know.  We see that you're not a trouble maker and you know, you're going to be a good 
member.  That's what uh (--)
M:  And do you pay dues?
T:  They pay dues, yes.
G:  It's a dollar a year.
M:  A dollar a year are the dues?
G:  Yeah, that's it.
M:  Where do you get money to run the club then?
G:  Well at the bar.
T:  From the bar.  From the bar.  Everything, well it's non-profit so everything goes right back 
into the, into the club.  
M:  Do you get paid to work here?
G:  Oh yeah, we get paid.
T:  They get paid, and we got the bartender and the Vice President, the President, they get paid.  
M:  Because those are, I'm surprised at such (--)
G:  Because we do a lot of work here ourselves, you know.  We do the repairing and things like 
that.  We do it all.  
T:  We have a Board of Directors, you know, we have three Officers and a Board of Directors.
M:  They are elected?  
T:  Yeah, elected through the Board.  
M:  And those are all of you people that are members of the club.  Do you have to have a French 
descent to be a member?
T&G:  No, no.  
T:  Some clubs I guess that was the by-laws of their thing. 
G:  Like the Lafayette.  
T:  But that's why it's not called a social club, because I guess that's, in their by-laws you had to 
be French to join.  So with this new law and everything else, I don't know how that works out.  
So, but over here it's a social club.  If you live in a neighborhood and they want, you're in good 
standing, you come in and you put an application, and if they qualify they become a member.  
M:  [Few words unclear] does the club do?
G:  We run dances upstairs.   Well we rent the hall.  And they have dances and Jack and Jills, 
wedding reception.  And then you have a kitchen down here?  
M:  And then you have a kitchen down here?
G:  We have a kitchen down here and one upstairs.  
M:  But most of the people when they come to the club, this is where, they come to this part 
down stairs?
G:  Down stairs, yeah, yeah, yeah.
M:  And what do they do in the day when the guys come in?
G:  They talk.  They talk and drink.  [Chuckles]
T:  Like this morning we'll have, we'll have a table here this morning to go out there and there's 
nobody sitting on that table under seventy-five years old.  We got one that's eighty-two.  We got 
uh, we'll have one gentleman coming here, he's ninety-years old.  He just went for his license and
he comes in every morning.  Ninety and he drives his own car [unclear].  He's just as sharp as 
this.  But there's one table there and they'd be sitting there, nobody though under seventy-five 
years old.  And when they talk about, and they talk about old times.
M:  And do they drink coffee, or beer?
G:  Just beer, period.  [Comment unclear]
T:  And they're French, and you won't hear them talk French.  
M:  Oh they'll be talking French, the elders?
T:  No, no.  At one time when they sat together they wouldn't talk English.  Now they hardly ever
talk French.  
M:  And it's the same people?
T:  Same people.  And they're not kids, like I'm saying.  One table not one of them, you have to 
be seventy-five or older to sit there.  And that's every morning, all but Sunday.
M:  Do they play cards, or backgammon?
G:  Oh yeah, they play card.
T:  They play cribbage and you know.
M:  Bridge?
T:  No, cribbage more.
M:  Cribbage.
T:  There used to be checker players.  That's gone now.  They don't play checkers no more.
G:  Yeah, there used to be a lot of that, you know, chess playing, but there's no more of that.  
Young ones don't seem to go for that, you know?
T:  In the old days, the old TV.
G:  The French people.  (T:  Huh?)  The old French people use to.
T:  TV and sports now.  You now, they watch TV and they get interested in sports and stuff like 
that.  It's like in the morning, let's say, in the morning you have a certain group, noontime another
group and then at night you had the working group, you know, come in.  It seems like it's broken 
down, you know?  
M:  Is it by age?
T:  Yeah, well yeah, because the working group.  Not by age, but like in the morning they're 
mostly all retirees, you know?  In the afternoon when you get to ones that early, early out of 
work, or the ones that are late out of bed we call it, they come in, you know.  Then at night well 
you have the working group come in.  
M:  Do you have young guys as members?  Twenties, thirties?
G:  Young fellows?
M:  Yeah.
G:  They got to be over twenty-one. 
T:  Oh yeah, we have them.  Oh yeah, [unclear], they're from the neighborhood.  And their father 
and grandfather quit here.  It's like myself now, my grandfather was a, came here.  And uh, my 
uncle came here and my brothers came here, and I've been here.  Even my father was Irish, he 
used to come here.  
M:  Oh you did?
T:  Well his brother-in-law used to work here.  So you know, he'd come down and see his 
brother-in-law.  And his father-in-law.  Like I said, all the uh, his in-laws were, were part of the 
club, so they came down the club.  
M:  Do they still play horse shoes?
G:  Oh no, there's no more of that.  
T:  That was uh, when there was no TV.  After TV came in it seemed it took all of this away.  You
know, like now they come in they watch TV with the sports.  Before they used to come in, they 
used to have horse shoe pair outside.  They'd come in and have a horse shoe.  They used to play 
all kind of, softball, used to have a softball league, baseball league at one time.  This, I mean 
you're going years ago, you know.  Because I had to walk, I had to walk (--)
M:  Do you still have it?
T:  Well during the Depression there was nothing, there was no work.  So you either played ball, 
or you drank, or you did something.  And there was not too much money to drink, so they played
ball and horse shoes and stuff.  So they started to have teams.  Right across the bridge they had a 
big beautiful ball park.  Aiken, it used to be the Aiken Street.
G:  C.M.A.C?
T:  The Aiken Street Park, right?
G:  Yeah.
T:  They had a big, it was all fenced in you know, just like you're going to a ball park.  They used
to have some good ball games in there, you know?
M:  Who would they play against?
G:  The Laurier Park they called it.
T:  They had leagues.  
G:  They called it The Laurier Park.   
T:  Yeah, the Laurier Park.
M:  The Laurier Park?
T:  Yeah.  That's uh, that was quite a park.  It was all fenced in, bleechers and everything else.
M:  Who would they play?
T:  They'd play teams from Maine.  They'd play teams from all over.  Well they had one team 
around here, [unclear], they used to call them the Aiken Street Stars.  You know, that's a, they 
were a good ball, ball team, you know.  The Paquette's, the twins used to play it, you know?  Oh 
yeah, that was uh, of course I was young.
M:  You stil have a team?  (T:  Huh?)  Do you still have a softball team, or baseball team?
T:  Baseball, regular baseball.  
M:  Now?  Today?
T:  Well no, we don't have any.
G:  No, today, no.  
T:  Like I say, they don't go.  No, you can't get the(--)  It's either TV, like I say, before.  TV and 
that's it.  It seems like the young generation is TV, and their sports is on TV.  I mean they don't 
seem to (--)  Some clubs might, you know, they get enthused into making ball game, or a 
baseball, but over here we don't seem to have that type of club, you know.  
M:  What about music?  Do people play music in here?
T:  No, we just have the (--)  Well during the day we might have the uh (--)
G:  We have the disc jockey that comes in whenever they have a Jack and Jill upstairs, but that's 
it.  You know, the Laurier Park too, they used to have the Wrestling over there at one time too.  
While they'd have baseball, and then every so often they'd have wrestling in the park itself.  
M:  Outside?
G:  Outside. This would be outside.  
M:  Do the French guys go in for wrestling?
G:  Well I guess the people did.  A lot of people did.  Because they used to draw a good crowd.  
There used to be I think at one time Jack Dempsey was the referee.  Do you remember that?   (T: 
unclear)  Yeah he was the referee of the bout.  So that drew the crowd, you know, just the name 
did. 
M:  And I was wondering if you [unclear], wasn't there another French Club in town?  Another 
social club?  C. M., what is it?
G:  Well the Past Time.  
T:  Well you had the Past Time, you had the C.C.A, you had the Pawtucket Social, you had uh, 
well then you're going Back Central. You had the Lithuanian Club and everything else.  And they
used to, a lot of these, not a lot of them, but I mean some of the clubs had, they used to sponsor 
some of these ball clubs, you know?  Like the Aiken Street Stars, I don't know who, if they were 
sponsored by the C.C.A. or Past Time.  The Aiken Street Stars, who they were sponsored by.  I 
don't know, I don't know who they were sponsored by.  But uh, they're a pretty good ball club.  
G:  Actually the Aiken Street Stars, I'm the one that started that.  Then it went into Ray 
Ducharme, [unclear], then he took over.  Remember?  When I went to work (--)
T:  When the Paquettes were playing and everything else?  
G:  Yeah, Paquette played too.  Oh that was uh, Paquette, the was uh (--)  (T:  The two twins)  
No, that was a different one.
T:  Because they're about your age.
G:  Yeah.
T:  [Comment unclear]
G:  Well Ray Ducharme, his father ran the team.  Remember that?
T:  No, not that one.
G:  You don't remember that?
T:  No,no.
G:  The Aiken Stars.
T:  Oh yeah, but that wasn't the one that played in the Laurier Club?
G:  No, no.
T:  I'm talking about the one that played in the Laurier Park.  
M:  That was still a ball club though?
G:  Yeah, that was a different one I guess.  We called it the Aiken, the Aiken, The Aiken Street 
Stars.  
M:  Did you play ball?
G:  Oh I did, yeah.
M:  Did you play too?
T:  No, no.
G:  I played ball until I went to work.  Started to work, then we, we needed money at the house 
because we were twelve in the family and my dad was the only one working.  So uh, I started to 
work, then the baseball went.  I had to give that up.
M:  How old were you when you went to work?  (G:  Huh?)  How old were you when you went 
to work?
G:  How old?  I was about eighteen I guess.  
M:  And you lived at home?  I guess that would be another difference, most of the kids used to 
live at home, didn't they?
G:  Oh yeah.
M:  Till they got married?
T:  Yeah, till they got married.  That's right.  Even today still, I had five, and I never had any that 
left home.  They left home and they got married.  I don't know.  I mean maybe it's a different way
of living, I don't know.  I never, my children never complained about saying I'm going to (--)  
Sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, saying I got to go live on my own.  
G:  Oh there's a lot of that today.
T:  I don't know if it's the parents that cause that or not, but I mean I got five and I never had any 
problem.  And they're not teenagers.  He's my youngest one.  I can't understand.  Maybe a 
different way of living than I did.  I don't know.  Probably a different way you were brought up.  
I have five brothers and no sisters.  Nobody left home until they got married.  Oh, well you left 
home to go in the service, but besides that.
M:  Yeah, and even after the service guys would come home.
T:  Yeah, they came home and they stayed there until they got married.  
M:  Do you have any daughters?  (T:  pardon me?)  Do you have daughters?  (G:  Daughters?)
T:  Yeah, I told you.  I have one, they both go, as I say they both graduated from Saint Louis 
Academy.  Three sons and two daughters. 
M:  Well I want to talk to you about these other French Clubs.  Did you ever go, do people go 
from one French club to another?  
T:  Oh sure!  You mean to visit or just to uh, oh yeah.  We have people coming here that belong 
to every French club in the city.  They'll show you (G:  their cards) a membership for every car, 
for every club, every French club.  And some even have clubs over here.  But now in Centraville 
you have, they come in here, they have a club for the Dom Polski, they have a club for the East 
End.  
M:  (laughing)  They belong to all the clubs?
T:  Yeah, they go, you know.
G:  There's some that will come down here for the morning.  And then they'll go to the C.C.A, or 
the Past Time for the afternoon.  And then they'll probably go to another one at night.  They're 
retired.  That's all they do, you know.  Go from one club to the other.
TAPE I, SIDE I ENDS
TAPE I, SIDE II BEGINS
T:  He'll go down to the Dom Polski, he'll come over here and then go down the East End and 
then go home.  
G:  And he'll probably do the same thing.
T:  Every morning, ninety years old.  
G:  And he drives a car.
M:  So he comes here, the Dom Polski, The East End (--)
T:  He goes to the Dom Polski first.  Then he come in here.  Then he goes to the East End and 
he's on his way home.  
M:  So he must have a group that meets him in each place.  
T:  No, he don't.  This is, no he's not with the others.
G:  No, no, he just goes over and [unclear].
T:  He's not a sitter, he's a drinker.  He's not a sitter.
G:  He's a drinker, you know.
T:  I don't say he's a heavy drinker, but I mean he come in, he has them, and then he goes home.  
But that's his original thing in the morning, every morning.  And I'll tell you he's a pretty sharp 
old son-of-a-gun for ninety years old.  
M:  What do the wives do when the husbands are here?  Do they have a kind off club or 
something.
G:  I guess they're watching TV.
T:  Well, well these gents here they're all pretty up in age.  But I mean uh, like during the 
weekend sometime a fellow will come down, especially Sunday, he'll come down with his wife, 
and they'll sit down for an hour or so, you know.  And they sit here and then they go home.  They
gab sometime, like on a Sunday the wives and husbands, a couple of tables there, they sit 
together and they you know, they get together.  They bring in some food and they sit there and 
eat.  They [unclear] there Sunday night.
G:  They play a little cards just among themselves.
M:  Do you have bingo [few words unclear]?
T:  No, we don't have bingo, no.  We don't have bingo.  We just relying on the bar business and 
the membership and that's it.  
M:  You're one of the few places that doesn't do bingo I think.
T:  Well a lot of places I guess the bingo is to raise money for the club.  (G:  But we don't)  We 
seem to be getting along this way so you know.
G:  It's been running like this for years.  So we never had, we never bothered.  At one time we 
used to run parties, Christmas parties for the under privileged children.  And this would be all 
donation money, donated by the, by the members and outsider also.  We ran, for the under 
privileged I think we ran that for about three or four years.  And then after that we ran it for the 
retarded for two years.  And then that just faded away after that.
T:  It's hard to get the workers now, you know what I mean?  The younger people don't seem to 
want to get involved with committees, you know, like that, you know. 
G:  They want to get paid for everything they do.
T:  So we have a committee down here that goes big for the Goodwill Industry.  They just had, a 
couple of weeks ago they just had a big party upstairs, a cookout, and the donation [unclear] was 
to the Goodwill Industry.  And they have, they'll be making another one now to make a 
Christmas party for.  No, I mean this is a group by themselves.  They do this and belong to the 
Centraville Social, but they, they do work for, they get together and they do work so they can 
give some money to the Goodwill.  This is not the only party.  I guess there's two others.  Now 
they're getting together to make, gathering money up to make a Christmas party for them.  Which
is you know, retarded people that work in Goodwill.  
M:  Oh, so they give the proceeds to the Goodwill after?
G:  Yeah, right.
T:  Like they might uh (--)
G:  They give us the money and we, we give it to them.  See we, actually they're the ones that 
run it, but uh (--)
T:  They get together, maybe two fellows get together and they make a, like I said, they just had a
cookout upstairs and the donation to the Goodwill.  
M:  What about the young guys?  You said they don't get involved with these committees?
T:  Well these are, well these are the, this is young.  (G:  They're in their fifties, or so)  From 
twenty-six on to maybe to thirty-five this group we're talking about, you know.  I mean real 
young, twenty -one, twenty-two, (G:  Yeah, they don't like to get involved) you know, they're TV
watchers, you know?  Over here.  The sports, they'll sit in the bleechers, or they'll sit in front of 
the TV.  And if you ask them to get involved in anything, no, I don't want to.  I'm not saying 
there's anything wrong with it, but that's their way.  
M:  Yeah, sure.  And do you do special stuff for the different holidays?
T:  We have, over here we run four meals.  Well we run four banquets, we give them four 
banquets a year.  We give them the meal, you know.  That we usually do it Christmas time, and 
we'll do it with Saint Patrick's Day, (G:  Saint Patrick's) we'll give a Saint Patrick's Day dinner.  
M:  Corn beef and cabbage?
T:  Yeah.
G:  Corn beef, oh yeah.  Oh yeah.  And that's all for nothing.  
T:  Yeah, you know, we give that to the membership.  And when we have, in fact when the Super 
bowl comes we have something.  Then we have the World Series come and we have something 
again.  So.
G:  That's when most of the members comes down then.  They know there's a free meal.
M:  For the games?  Oh for the meals.  And that's when they bring their families?  Or just 
[unclear]?
G:  Oh no, no.
T:  Well this is just a (--)
G:  Well sometimes their wives.
T:  We let them bring their date, bring their wives down.  Or most of them will say can I have a 
plate to go for my wife, or something like that, you know?  But they usually, the Super bowl and 
the World Series are usually members that are going to come down here and they're going to 
watch the game anyway, you know?  So that's which we put out the meal then.
M:  And what would you say about the French community in Lowell?  Would you say that(--)  
You know, you said that there still is a real French community, right?
T:  Well in Centraville, yeah, I would say there is.  
G:  It's kind of mixed now.
T:  Like I say, it's still on account of Saint Louis Parish.  I don't say you're going to find speaking 
French in the streets like you used to.  You know, not the young people, you know.  I'm not 
saying young, any, like I say, that group there now, they're strictly Frenchmen, and at one time 
they'd sit there and nothing but French, but now they don't talk French no more.  And even the 
old people have to get away from it.  If they know English, they have to talk English, because 
people talk English to them, you know?  They got to get away from it.
M:  But I understood it was important that the people still have a French Mass.  
T:  I don't (--)  Yeah, I think Saint Louis does.  They have a ten o'clock Mass, and a lot of people 
won't miss that ten o'clock mass.
G:  Yeah.
M: In French?
T&G:  In French, yeah. 
T:  And a lot of people just wait for that ten o'clock mass on Sunday just because it is French.  
You know.
G:  But this is just the old people though.  The young, the young won't.  Actually you'd never 
hear them talk French.  If you run into somebody that talking French, you can, you can bet your 
can that they're over sixty, or seventy, you know.  Those are the only ones that will talk French.  
T:  I've got two daughters that went all the way through French School.  (G:  And they don't they 
never talk French)  My oldest daughter and my youngest daughter.  And you know, they don't 
talk French.  They can, but you know, but when they talk French you'd think they came from 
Paris, you know, because that's the way they were taught.  Like this fellow here, he went to Saint 
Joseph's and he won high honors in French.  When he talks it's the same way, you'd think he 
came from France and he thinks twice, you know, before anything comes out.  But he don't use it
that much, you now, after they left school.  Like I say, at home, my wife and I when we're home 
we talk French.  We're in the car we talk French.  If we don't want the children to know what 
we're saying, we talk French.   
M:  Did you just start doing that recently, or you just always.
T:  Oh no.  No we always, since, since, well I, my wife was born in Centraville and I was born in 
Centraville.  We knew ourselves all through life.  And she was French and I came, and I could 
speak French.  I went to French School, so we just keep it up.  Some time we meet people in the 
store or something, they're French.  And we'll talk French.  Like here relatives, she's got some, 
she has uncles and aunts that are pretty old.  And when we gather with them we talk French, you 
know.  
M:  Do you still eat certain French foods?  
T:  Well I might. Well it depends what you like to, we call French food.  We have (--)
G:  Boil dinner is French, isn't it.  (T:  Huh?)  Boil dinner, isn't that French?
T:  No, but we never, like I say (--)  At my house, what you'd call Corton, porkscrap, right?  (G: 
That's French)  What they called porkscrap, Corton.  It's uh, it's not, you wouldn't call luncheon 
meat, but you could put it on your, you know.  Now at my house I still buy it.  They love it.  (G:  
Pork pie)  Now at Christmas time I got to have pork pie.  When they all gather at home from the 
midnight mass I got to have pork pie.  And I buy pork pie and I make pork pie for, well more or 
less in the wintertime than the summer.  We still have it for [unclear].
M:  Can you buy it?
T:  Oh yeah, you can buy them.  Cote's Market across the bridge, which is in the French district 
again, and they cater to that, you know, pork pie.
M:  I'm going to buy some.  I'm going to buy a pork pie.
T:  And even over here in Centraville.
G:  That's on Salem Street, you know, [unclear].
T:  Even in Centraville here, Vic's Bakery.  He, he's a, he sells more pork pies in one day than 
apple pies, that's for sure.  
M:  Vic's Bakery?
T:  Yeah, right here.
G:  Right here at the corner.  At the corner of Lilley and West Sixth.  
T:  He sells more pork pie than apple pie.  Everyday he has orders.  I bet you it's nothing for him 
to sell a hundred pork pies.  
G:  I think you have to put in your order too.  
T:  Yeah, some have to.
M:  But mostly in the wintertime.
T:  No, year round.  (G: year round)  Year round.  Oh yeah.  I mean it's still, a lot of people, that's
a meal.  Pork pie and potato.  And potato, some people make it a different way, you know.   But 
[unclear]  And like I say, this is still, when you talk about Centraville, it's the last [unclear] of 
Centraville.  East Centraville, West Centraville and you know.  In other words, you come from a 
French section, or you come form the Irish section.  [Unclear].
M:  You know, what do they call the different sections?  Nobody ever tells me that, of 
Centraville?  Do you call them different things?  East Centraville you said?
T:  Yeah, and the other part is West Centraville.  Usually you know, like from Coburn Street on is
called West Centraville, you know?  
M:  And [unclear] this is West Centraville.
T:  Well a lot of people would say East Centraville, or Centraville.  When you said Centraville 
you were suppose to be calling this part Centraville.  And if you go on Coburn Street it would be 
West Centraville, [G:  west] you know.  That's where, from Coburn Street, like I say, up to 
Christian Hill.  Up around that section, you know?  
T:  And it's still the same way.  Well I shouldn't say it's still the same way, but you still have 
Fulton Street, West [unclear], and from, that's still, what migrated around there you still find a lot
of polish there, you know, still live in that section.  Like over here, you go in this section here, 
you go from Fisher Street, up to Campaw [G:  yeah, you got a lot of Hispanic there].  You know, 
and where I live, you know, I live on, almost near the Dracut line.  And you go up my section, 
you look at the mailbox you'll see most of them are still French, you know?
M:  Out in the Dracut line?
T:  Well that's from, we'll say from Fisher Street to Dean Avenue, you know, and all up around 
that.  Around Orlean and Lupine and Fred Street.  You look around the mailbox and you'll see it's
mostly all French, you know?  The name.  I wouldn't say they'll talk to you in French, but the 
name is still French, you know?  
M:  Would you mind if your kids married people who weren't French? Or would you rather have 
them marry, would that make you happy?
T:  It don't make no difference to me.  But I mean I don't think it makes any difference to 
anybody now.  But it's just the idea that, I think what it is, more or less, see.  Myself, my father 
came from the other part of the city, but he married my mother and came here.  Now we were 
five brothers.  Out of five brothers there's four of us bought homes in Centraville.  My other 
brother, he's in California.  And we settled in this part of Centraville.  
M:  In this part of Centraville?
T:  The same part of Centraville.  We all bought our home in this part of Centraville.  Out of five,
four bought them in Centraville.  
M:  Because of each other?
T:  No!  Well I don't think it's because of each other.  I think because the mother and father was 
living (--)  My mother and father was living in Centraville and we lived in Centraville and your 
friends were in Centraville, so.  Who you went to school with was in Centraville, so you stayed 
in Centraville.  My wife came from Centraville.  My other three brothers, their wives, my other 
brother's wife came from Centraville.  But the other two, their wives didn't come(--)  No, there's 
only on that got married and his wife didn't come from Centraville.  See, that's another thing.  
Out of four, out of five, there's only one that wasn't, came, didn't come from Centraville.  
M:  The one in California?
T:  The one in California.  Everybody married a girl from Centraville.
M:  Do you know how your parents met?
T:  My four brothers, we all married girls from Centraville.
M:  But with your parents I'm thinking, because your mother married someone who wasn't from 
Centraville.  Do you know how?
T:  I told them my mother married an Irishman on the other side of the city.
M:  Yes.  Do you know how they met each other?
T:  Well he's a fighter, he's a prize fighter.  And that's, you now, and he was a dancer and she was 
a dancer.  You know, they met, you know, that way there.  
M:  At a dance?  Are there still dances around?  
T:  No.  They used to have (--)  Like myself, when I was born and brought up, I used to go, like 
you say, sports.  But my sports I used to look forward to Friday and Saturday to go to CYO 
dances.  But you don't even have that anymore, you know?
G:  The only thing you have now is Jack and Jills.  [Unclear]
M:  What is Jack and Jill.
T:  Jack and Jill, when somebody gets, you know, it's (--)
G:  Somebody getting married and they're just running a good time for them, you know?
T:  Somebody getting married and they run a party for the bride and groom.  But I mean as far as 
a parish dance, I think there's very few around, you know?  
M:  Does the church do any kind of social thing?  
T:  No, they don't have no more.
G:  They have bingo, period.  
T:  When I was (--)  You used to have Immaculate Conception.
G:  They had movies and everything at one time.  
T:  They used to run the dance at the Immaculate Conception, but you didn't have to come from 
Immaculate Conception.  That was the biggest CYO dance around, you know?  But you had to 
behave, because the priest were right there to you know.  And then from the time I was fourteen 
years old to the time I went in the service, I went to CYO Dances.  
G:  The school, once in awhile the school, they'll probably run a bean supper.  (M:  Now?)  Yeah,
they still, probably.  I would say probably four, four times a year.  Sometimes it for the Boy 
Scout and just to make money for them, you know, or for the school.
T:  And even Saint Louis, even Saint Louis had their dance, the CYO dances.  But with the 
generation coming up it just faded out, I don't know, you know?
M:  What about these new immigrant groups?  Who are they in Centraville?  The newer, you 
know, [unclear].
T:  Well this part of Centraville, you don't have too many, this part.  The other part of Centraville 
you can get your Cambodian, you got Vietnamese, you've got the Puerto Ricans, you know.  But 
that's the other part of Centraville. I don't know why.
M:  Is that still West, I mean um, West Centraville?
T:  West Centraville, you know what I mean?
G:  That would be West, yeah.
M:  But we're not in West Centraville.
G:  We're in the East.  Well it's Centraville, or East.  
T:  We're in this part, we're very few, I'm saying if you want refugee, or whatever you want to 
call them, we have very few in this part of Centraville, [G:  Spanish] you know?  We're got a few
Cambodian, but they stay by themselves.  They're only, and I don't know if there's any, anything 
else besides them around on this part of Centraville, you know?
M:  You didn't have any [few words unclear]?
T:  But I mean there's no, why I think there's none is because there's no openings.  I men the 
people that live here stay here, and there's no apartments for them to get.  I don't think, it's not 
that they're not wanted, there's no place for them to move into to, you know?
M:  Do they have their own church?
T:  Well they have a Puerto Rican Church, it used to be a Baptist Church.  But uh, I don't know, 
they must come from someplace else.  I don't think, unless they come from the other part of 
Centraville.  
G:  They do, yeah.  They come from downtown.
T:  Well whatever, I don't know.  
M:  Oh, they go to this one on First Street?
T:  No, right here.
G:  This one is right aside of the Fire House on West Sixth Street.  
T:  It's in this district.
G:  The corner of Ennell and West Sixth.  
T:  It's in this district, but why?  I don't know.
M:  Because they're aren't that many Spanish people around. 
T:  Not, on the other parts, but this part here like I said, I don't know any.
G:  Not on this side.
T:  The only thing I know, maybe four or five families of Cambodians, or Vietnamese, you know,
that's all that I know around here.  
M:  But the Cambodians they don't go to the Saint Louis Church, do they?
G:  No.
T:  I don't know, I don't know what their religion is, so I don't know. 
G:  Yeah, well you may have a few which are Catholic [unclear].  I think there used to be a lot of 
them going to Saint Jean Baptist.  I don't know if they still (--)
T:  Well they have, they have a, Saint Jean Baptist runs a Spanish Mass.  That's why they used to 
see them over there.  That's a French parish, but there's no more Frenchman there.  I mean, the 
families moved away when they had the renewal over there, okay.  When they tore down all the 
blocks in Little Canada, that parish had to, a lot of it on Salem Street turned to the Spanish.  So 
they had to go to, they go to Saint Jean Baptist, because they run a special Mass for them on 
Sunday morning.  I think it's nine o'clock Sunday morning they have a Spanish Mass, you know.
M:  It's funny that the French Church has Spanish Masses.  
T:  Yup.  But as far as saying, I think as any place goes, maybe you might have different 
nationalities, but as far as French goes and Greek go today, I think in Lowell it's all one, you 
know.  It's not, no more of this we'll say, cut this.  This part if yours, this part is mine.  You know 
what I mean?  You know anybody moving into Centraville now, I don't care if you're Polish, 
French, Greek, it don't make no different.  [Voices in the background are getting louder]
M:  See, I was going to ask you what is the neighborhood like now in Centraville.  I mean you 
said it's mixed up.  You don't have a [few words unclear]?
T:  Oh yeah.  Across the street from me now I have a Polish family.  Well he married a Peasley, 
he married to a Polish girl, right?  His family, now his wife was Polish.  So all his children went 
to, on High Street to school.  The one up to uh, [unclear] the Polish School.  That's what he 
wanted.  So they, but they bought their home in Centraville, but they sent their children to Polish 
school.
M:  And they live next to you?
T:  Yeah, they live right across the street.
M:  Who else lives on your Street.
T:  Uh Lup, Lupine.
M:  Is that French?
T:  Well like you said, like I say, it's not all French no more.  It used to be.  You know, a long 
time ago it was French.
M:  So you have French, Polish.
T:  Yeah, I got Polish.  Let's see, we got Irish, you know.  [Few words unclear] you know, you 
can't tell.  You can't actually tell what they are because a lot of them they're home for, like when 
the other people were here their home [few words unclear] because of the children.  And 
whoever married who gets the house.  It's like myself.  I owned my house I don't know how 
many years, and when I get married [comment unclear].  His name will we Burns, you know, 
Irish name.  So I don't care if he's married a French girl.  As far as I'm (--)  Right now I have two,
the first married and they married out of Centraville.  My son is getting married in a couple of 
weeks.  He's not marrying nobody from Centraville.  So maybe he's breaking the tradition.  My 
son and daughter don't even live in Centraville.
M:  Do they live in Lowell?
T:  They live in Lowell, they don't live in Centraville.  That's you know, and they don't seem to 
care where they live.  Unlike myself, when I got married, I wanted to live in Centraville.  They 
don't care where they live, you know, if it's Centraville or not.  So that's, that's a tradition that's 
breaking out too.  At one time you want to live in Centraville where you were born and brought 
up. It's not that mine was French.  I stayed here.  My mother was French.  I went to French 
school.  And that's what uh, it's doing away from that.  Whatever you get an apartment maybe, or
someplace to live.  
M:  So they don't care if they move to Belvidere, or Christian Hill.  I'm not trying to (--)  Is there 
a rich section in Centraville?
T:  Well, in Centraville?  
M:  Rich and poor.
G:  They all run about the same.
T:  Well not this part of Centraville I don't think.  You know, I don't think this part of Centraville. 
The other part of Centraville, it's not because it's rich and poor, I think it's because of the type of 
people that moved out and the type of people that moved in that changed the other part of 
Centraville.  I don't think it's rich or poor. 
G:  It's not like the Acres.  Not at all.  The Acre is where you got some poor people.  
T:  I'm not saying anything about the different nationalities, but I think that we, the other part of 
Centraville you have a lot of Vietnamese, a lot of Puerto Ricans moved in, which changed the 
outlook.  They moved in more, they moved in we'll say, the Polish section of Centraville, you 
know?  The Polish moved out someplace else.  
M:  Where?
T:  I don't know.  At one time around High Street, that was suppose to be a lot of Polish there too.
Now they're, I don't know if they're gone away, or just like I say, they got inter married and they 
moved anyplace, you know.  
M:  What about Christian Hill?  People tell me [unclear].
T:  Well Christian Hill was more, there was money up there because they, it was mostly, if you 
lived on Christian Hill it was a doctor, a lawyer, or you worked for the bank, or you worked for, 
you had a good position in the city hall.  That's, that's not there no more either, you know what I 
mean.  You were born and brought up in Centraville, but you turned out to be something pretty 
good, well you went up on Christian Hill.  Just like Regan, I guess he lives up in Washington.  
They put him in the White House [unclear]. 
M:  That's true.  
T:  That's why I went into Washington this weekend, and I was talking to the tour guide.  She 
says there's only two presidents, only one president that lived in the White House.  I said, you 
better read you history again.  There's two presidents that lived in the White House.  She says, 
no, there's only one president that lives in the White House.  Well I said, okay.  George 
Washington.  Mr. Truman never lived in the White House.  He lived in the Blair House, because 
he had the inside of the White House all done.  Right?
M:  I didn't know that.  
T:  I'm just getting off to (--)  Like I say, Christian Hill.  Christian Hill, if you started getting a 
good job in the bank, or you get this and that, you move from this part to up on the hill, [few 
words unclear].  
M:  Did French people move up there too, when they got good jobs?
T:  Oh yeah, you have the ones that had you know, good position, or something like that.  They 
you know, they went up on the hill.  
M:  Is that what people still do?
T:  No, no.  Christian Hill now is just like any other place else, you know.  Nice homes up there 
on the hill, but I mean as far as because you came here and that (--)  But all of them like I say, 
like the Hall Family, was doctors and lawyers, but they were born and brought up there.  It's not 
because you know, they were, they came from Centraville, they want to stay in Centraville, you 
know?  
M:  If your kids got money, say your son became Vice-President of the bank or something, where
would he move to?
T:  I think today's generation he wouldn't care, you know, I don't think they'd care.  Wherever 
they could uh, we'll say if he's high enough, I'd say he'd get a good plot of land and build his own
house I think, my own, you know?  Even today I have one son, that's what he's looking forward 
to.  He's looking forward to building his own home.  And where?  He don't care.  He can go to 
Pepperell, he don't even have to stay in Lowell.  He can go on the outskirts.  He's not uh, like I 
say, I don't like before where they have to be in one section, you now.  
G:  They like to stay close to the mother and father now.  
T:  I don't (--)  You know, still today close, you got you know, you can go in the outskirts and it 
ain't that far.  But he's looking to buy, he's looking to build his home and he don't care where it's 
going to be.  You know, find a good piece of land and a good place to raise the children, that's all 
he cares about.  
M:  But aren't there still places that are prestigious, like Andover Street, or Andover.
G:  Oh Andover, you've got to have a few dollars.
T:  Well I don't, it used to be.  I think now Andover Street is uh, you got houses are big, on 
Andover Street you got big houses there that they made apartments out of them.  At one time it 
was you know, now who rents these apartments?  Not the doctor and lawyer that used to live on 
Andover Street [unclear], you know?  I don't think it's like it used to be either.  Even the young, 
like you say, if he makes it in Lowell I don't think he's looking to live on Andover Street.  He's 
looking for a nice place to live, you know?
M:  In your case, when they wanted to get together with their friends, like here in old times 
people would you know, take a walk down here with [unclear] the guys.  Where would your sons
go, or your daughters go to meet their friends?  
T:  Well in my case they meet at home.  Because I don't think it's like before.  They, they have a 
group that they go out with, it's with their group, you know.
M:  Do they have groups that they go out with?
T:  Well they have them.  My oldest son Ray has two or three couples and that's what they do.  
They gather one week, it's up his house, next week it's up the other ones house, [unclear].  Then 
if they have a Saturday or Sunday, well they get together and they go on a camping trip, or 
something.  Maybe they'll go on a camping trip, you know.  It's a different way of life than it was
with mine, you know.  
M:  Would you bring your friends home when you were younger, to the house?  
T:  Sure.  My mother and father it was their pet peeve, you bring your friend home and know 
who they are.  You wouldn't chase them away.  That's what gets into what today's problem is.  
They chase them away.  Even my own son and my own daughter.  I'd make sure.  Hey, I don't 
care if you can't go in his house, but you bring him here.  I didn't chase him away.  Like I said, I 
had five of them and none of them never left home.  Even today, they were married or something
like that, I have a little trailer, the couples of my daughters [unclear] you know, they come up on 
Sunday.  They got their friends with them.  You know?  Today I think that's one of the biggest 
thing.  Hey, don't bring them here, or don't do this, you know?  How are you going to know who 
they go out with if don't let them come in and see what they, what they are.  
M:  See I wondered if maybe in the old says, like today the kids will have the party Saturday 
night.  They'll bring their friends like you said, and someone bring friends, would that happen in 
the old days, or would people tend to meet outside the home, like a club or something.  
T:  Well in the olden days, like my, my own experience like when I was young, I'm talking about 
my, you know, my mother and father like I say, they migrated on my mother's side they migrated 
all down from Canada.  And up in Dracut one of the brother's had a big farm out there on Hope.  
Well that was the gathering for the Levi clan, that was my mother's maiden name.  So every 
Sunday off you went to Dracut.  Children, grandchildren, whoever was in that clan, and every 
Sunday they met up there.
M:  And where was it?
T:  In Dracut.  Hope, Hope Avenue, or Hope Street in Dracut.  
M:  Was it a Park?
T:  No, no, that was his, he had a farm.  He was one of them that came here and migrated from 
Canada, which was my uncle, my mother's uncle.  It's where he had the big farm, and one of 
them had a lot of land there.  That was the gathering place on Sunday.  Always up there.  
Everybody bring their own.  My mother, my mother bring something.  Her mother and father 
bring something, you know, the sisters and that was the, that's where they met on Sunday.  You 
were there from Sunday morning after Mass, till they got back, you know.  And they'd take the 
bus.  
M:  Did you sing or dance, or whatever, at those places?
T:  Well some they used to sing.  You could (--)  This was all family though, you know what I 
mean?  (M:  Yeah)  Oh yeah, we used to sing, something like that.  That was strictly French, 
because they were all French, you know.  
M:  Would anybody play an instrument?
T:  Oh yeah, oh yeah.
M:  What?
T:  Well they could play the banjo, guitar.  They used to have piano.  Like they had a porch, a 
big, big porch on top.  Underneath the porch he had made, it was like open, but it was covered 
from the porch and they, you always leave the piano right there.  And they used to gather and 
sing, and you know, oh yeah.  They'd sing and dance out there.  We'd have the cadrilles.  
M:  The cadrilles, I was just going to ask you.
T:  Oh yeah, yeah.  Then like the next, that's what I'm saying, that's how the generation changed. 
Like they started to go and my mother's generation, well after [unclear], and they changed.  They
used to visit at home, brothers and sisters, but there was no more you see big big family 
gathering, you know?  
M:  Do you have reunions anymore?
T:  My own family.  That's my own family.  My mother and father are all, my family are all gone,
and my cousin, well I have one cousin left.  He's in New York.  So I only see him when he comes
down.  But my own family, I'm talking about my five, my five children, and my nieces and 
nephews, well we meet.  
M:  At your house?
T:  At my house, or in the summertime we have it up the campground, you know?
M:  Do you still play music?
T:  No, not my, I play very easy.  You just turn on the stereo, that's what I do.  
M:  Do they know how to dance the Cadrille?
T:  No, no.  I think I'm the only one that knows in the family that's left.  Me and my wife, we 
used to you know,(--)
M:  But I bet if you have a wedding, then you dance it, don't you?  
T:  No.  That's another thing, it don't seem to, it don't seem to come up, you know?  
G:  There's no more of that.  There's no more of that.
T:  It don't seem to come up.  Like I say, the generation are too young and they don't go for that.  
If you go to a wedding, nobody that old is getting married, that's who you know, is going to have 
Cadrille.  But it's very [unclear].  If you ask for it they'll have it, but you might be the only two 
on the floor that's going to dance, you know?  No, you don't find it anymore.  
M:  Are there any French bands in Lowell?
G:  No.
T:  There's no more of that.  (G:  No)  No.  Once in awhile they'll have them come in from 
Canada, you know, or they'll have them (--)  They have French Chorus, they have two French 
Chorus still left in the City of Lowell.  They have the Saint Theresa's Men's Club.  
M:  What is it?
T:  Saint Theresa, which is a French parish in Dracut, that they have (--)
G:  The American Chorus, aint it?   That's Ayotte?  
T:  They have two Chorus, they're still French.  The Dracut (--)
M:  You use the church right?
T:  Huh?
G:  Let me see.
M:  Saint Theresa's [unclear]?
T:  I don't know if they call the other one French.  They come down, they come upstairs in the 
wintertime every Wednesday.  They come upstairs and they practice.  Any time a parish, a French
parish, or something they want, they usually get one of these chorus, because they're the ones 
that sing in French. 
M:  And they sing in French.
T:  Both, but I mean mostly if you want they know everything in French.  You know, they 
practice it in French.  
M:  Are they both church Chorus?
T:  No, no.  They just call them that, but they don't belong to the church.  You know, they take it 
on their own to keep the French Chorus you know, the singing.  And they'll sing not only church 
songs, we'll say religious songs, they go all kinds of French songs.  All kinds of songs, but 
mostly they, if you go into a parish, or if you're going to have a banquet or something you want it
to be in French, well you could get them.  They come down and they sing.  They're a big group, 
they're not small.  You know, there might be twenty, twenty-five of them.
M:  Oh I'd like to hear them.  Do they practice in the summer?  
T:  Yeah, but mostly, unless it's something special.  Like from uh, they usually stop let's say June,
and they'll, well they just started back.  Now every Wednesday in September they started back.  
They started back actually last week.  They'll come back now until next June, every Wednesday.  
M:  At seven or something.
T:  Pardon me?
M:  At seven at night, or something?
T:  Yeah, seven.  Usually seven to nine they come in, you know.
M:  Gee, maybe I can hear them.  (T:  What?)  Maybe I can hear them?  
T:  Yeah, yeah!
M:  That's the Saint Theresa's that practices here?
T:   No, that's (--)  Saint Theresa's, they call it Saint Theresa's Men's Club.  A lot of them in that 
belong to this one.  I don't actually know what the name of this one is. 
G:  I think the name is The American Male Chorus.
M:  The American (G:  Male Chorus).  Do you have their phone number by any chance?  
T:  No, no.
G:  The only one you could get in touch with that, he's the President of the Union National Bank 
in Collinsville.  That's Raymond uh, what's his name?  Ray?
T:  His name is uh (--)
G:  Oh no, you're talking about the (--)  I can't remember his name.
M:  [Phrase unclear].  (G: Huh?)  Is that the one you were thinking of?  Is it [phrase unclear]?
TAPE I, SIDE II ENDS.
LFP-MN-RO41
Side one of this tape begins with Thomas in mid-sentence:
T:  I married a French girl and stayed that way, you know?  My children, they don't [unclear].  
Like I say, so far there's three that's going to be married.  They don't care if they're French or 
English, or whatever.  I men they don't care if they live in Centraville or not either.
M:  But what did you say about Christmas Eve?  They come, they eat pork pies together?
T:  Christmas Eve, Christmas Eve they gather at my home, my family, you know.  And that's 
what we, I have the ritual that we go to midnight Mass together, you know, with my children.  
And they have to have pork pies when they come back from the Mass, you know?  And I make 
the pork pies, so you know.
M:  You make it?  (T:  Yeah)  How do you make it?
T:  Well your ground pork you know, and all the seasoning and it's just like making a pie, you 
know.  You got the ground pork and the seasoning.  Everybody has different seasoning they put 
in.  Everybody, you can't say you're going to take one pork pie is going to be the same as the 
other pork pie.  
M:  What seasoning do you put in?  
T:  Well there's all kinds.  I mean I can't, you know, right off the top, but it's all kinds of French 
seasoning, you know.  It's not French, but you get the zip when you put in.  
G:  The name is Joe Harvey.  
M:  Sorry?
G:  Joe Harvey.  
T:  Harvey, yeah.
M:  The name was Harvey.  [Unclear] pork pie.
G:  What's this, you got another tape on here?
M:  Well I'm only [few words unclear].  I know you got to go, but just tell me about the Christ 
(--)  Do you still celebrate New Years Eve too?  
T:  I don't.  I never did anyway.  And as far as [unclear] generation, me and my father and mother
didn't believe in uh, New Years Eve was a home thing.  There never were, because a lot of (--)  
I'm the same way, my wife and I, New Years is home thing.  I'm not saying we don't go out, my 
children or something some to the home, they don't go out.  And the one, especially now the ones
that are married, they come up the house.  But as far as going out nights, something like that, that
wasn't our cup of tea.
M:  But do you celebrate?  Didn't people use to have, isn't it [Le Reveillon]. 
T:  Reveillon!  Yeah.  I mean that was the only, (G: That's at eight o'clock) that's another thing.  
They get at the house and they'll have pork pie, or whatever, whatever you want.
M:  That's on New Years Eve?
T:  That's New Years Eve.  Yeah.  And they stay up.  
M:  And what do you do now on that?
T:  Well at our house we just you know, talk and have a few drinks.
G:  And that's about it.  
M:  Do people still come, your kids still come to your house for that.
T:  Oh yeah.  The ones that's not married, they usually go out someplace,  but the ones that's 
married, they usually come up the house.  Our thing is Christmas.  Christmas Eve, that's our 
thing.  we have, like I say we go to Christmas, New Years, they go to the Mass, midnight Mass, 
and they stay up.  They call that a Reveillon too.  That's uh, that was an old tradition.  They went 
to midnight mass and they stayed up [few words unclear].  
M:  And in the old days did you used to do that too?
T:  Oh yeah.  My, that's why I kept it up, because that was the tradition in my time, you know.  
We all went to uh, at my time it was my mother and father's house.  And all my brothers, even if 
they were married, we gathered at my mother and father's house, you know?  And when my 
mother was [unclear] up to the grandmother, which was my grandmother and grandfather, you 
know?  [Lots of noise in background]   [Unclear] did mostly the same thing, it was going to 
midnight mass, and your grandmother and grandfather.  It's just like now, I mind, I don't go to 
midnight Mass so I mind the grandchildren.  But this is past down.  You go to the Mass the next 
morning, six o'clock, seven o'clock.  (M:  in the morning?)  By myself.  I don't go to midnight 
mass no more.  I stay in and watch the grandchildren.  But my children, they all go together, they
go to midnight mass together.  
M:  Do you celebrate any of the other holidays?  Easter or?
T:  Oh yeah.  Oh every holiday, like this holiday coming up now, I mean Labor Day, we'll be 
altogether.  (M:  where?)  We'll probably be up the trailer park.  You know I have a trailer.  But 
all of my children will be there with me.  My grandchildren.  And I'll have my uh, I have a niece 
and nephew that my brother and his wife died young.  And they come with us for a week for 
Labor Day, and Christmas [unclear].  Their mother and daughter died very young.  
M:  What other days do you guys get together?  Christmas and Labor Day.
T:  We got Thanksgiving, all the holidays we get together.  The main holidays, you know.  Like 
Thanksgiving, or something like that.  It was that way with my mother and father and I kept it 
that way.  [Unclear] with me after my mother died.  And when I got married and we kept it that 
way.  We always met at the father and mother's house.  And that's the way it is now.  And it was 
my children when we got married.  [Lots of noise on tape]
M:  What about birthdays, or, do you celebrate name days?
T:  Well that depends on the family I think.  Like I say, we celebrate the children's birthdays.  We 
celebrate the grandchildren's birthdays, but a lot of people don't.  We do.  Maybe I'm very 
fortunate, I have a very close knit family.  Maybe I'm fortunate, I don't know.  
M:  And then I guess they all come from (--)
T:  And my brothers and sisters, and my brother-in-laws, they're very close to each other.  
M:  I'm not going to need the two actually.
T:  No.  I think I'm very fortunate that way, you know.
M:  Would you say your family is typical?
T:  I don't know, because to me I think so, because of what I see other families.  Some like, you 
see some of them, they don't even talk to each other, you know?  I don't know if they're all that 
way.  Like his family is pretty close knit, you know.  Even my family, I didn't see much of them 
because of the, between depression they were in the CC's.  Then I have one brother that was in 
the, from 1938 to 1947 I didn't see him.  My oldest brother.  He was in the CC's, he was in the 
army.  
M:  The CC's?
T:  Yeah, well in those days you could call it you know, there was no work.  
G:  UPA, or something like that.
T:  That was like WPA, so the people could (--)
G:  The government ran that.  
T:  You go away and work, the Compensation Corps, you know.  They take them to Vermont, or 
some different place.  They had uniforms and they stayed in camps.  It was kind, not the army, 
but these were from sixteen to eighteen, or sixteen to twenty, whatever it was.  
G:  Yeah it was young, you know.  Sixteen to twenty-one I think it was.  
T:  My oldest brother, it was during the depression, he couldn't get no job.  That's what I'm 
saying.  I didn't see him for like I say, 1938 till 1947.  He come out of the CC's, I mean I seen 
him, but not as a brother, you know.  When I seen him he was a grown man.  And I had four 
brothers the same way.  They, Second World War
I was the youngest one.  So the Second World War they were all gone.  That's four years, five 
years.  And that was their growing years where you could be together.  But still we were close.  
You know when they came back we still were close.  But I think it's not as close as my own 
family, because thank God they didn't have to go through that.  
M:  Yeah, wasn't that great.  But I mean other families would get together over the holidays and 
Labor Day.  I guess there's lots of family cookouts on Labor Day, aren't they?
T:  Oh like I say, we do, I do.  I don't know everybody else.  Like Labor Day they'll be all up the 
Camp Ground, they'll be all there.  The grandchildren and son-in-law, daughter-in-law, they'll all 
be up the camp ground.  That'd be our day, Sunday.  Usually my niece and nephew comes up.  
She'll come up with her, she'll come up with her husband and her children, you know?  [Unclear]
not married.
