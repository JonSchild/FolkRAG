Ron: What about these work trains could you describe them?
<unintelligible text>: When they had a slide on the road, they would haul a ditcher out
there to ditch the slide off. If they had any more work to do other than that, unloading
rails, balances, and loading rails, just anything they had to do on the line of the road. They
would use them instead of a regular schelued frieght train. They would callout on the road
and <maybe?> work for a week at the time, all up and down the road. They would have a
section man to stay with them to do this work until after quitting, and then returned to the
headquarters. They would stay at home, only the train
crew would stay overnight. If they had anything for us to do, they would call us out the next
morning. They would take us to unload ties, balances, ties, or just anything along the road.
That's what they used the work train for.
Ron: Then the camp car ...
<unintelligible text>: Well, they had extra gangs located along the road, in different places
and locations. a bunch of colored men they keep on there. They would service and mind
track. They would put up the worst track along the road then switch to another mans
territory. Like if I had some rough track about a mile here, if I didn't have enough men, they

him.
Ron: Would they just have to stay in these tell they got their job done?
<unintelligible text>: Yes, sir. Yes, they would move them say they done with the work

they was going to work. They would have 30 to 35 colored men and extra gang forman.
He prepared the food for them. He keep a commissary on the car. He boarded them and
board stack them food and keep them on the car. He had shoes, mugs, and overalls,
anything they we need right on there. Of course, he would board stock then and get his
pay cut of the niggers, you know. That's the way they did it.

didn't have no highways and they had to use the passenger trains then. All the employees

Ron: Well, these gates you were talking about over the railroad. Did you ever hear them
not working and causing someone to get hit?
<unintelligible text>: No, they generally work, if they don't work the dispatcher knows
if right now down at Ravenna. I shows up on that board some way or another. If those
don't work it won't be an hour before they have a signal detail working on it. Only thing
sometimes one of these boards will let down as a car comes along and maybe breaks one
of them off. Troy <unintelligible text> had a bread truck come through here, about the time
that board come down. We saw the train and <unintelligible text> scared and tried to back
up and the board fell on the hood of his car. He saw that he had to do something so he
back up and broke the board.
Ron: Was you around when they started building the railroad? If so what year was that?
<unintelligible text>: That Was about <1908?> or <1909?>.
Ron: When was the train depot built down here in Jackson?
<unintelligible text>: They had a small one when the railroad first came through. I just
couldn't tell you. It must have been built in 1928 or 1929. They cleared the smaller one
down and built the new one. You know the <unintelligible text> came through there
before the <unintelligible text> came. The <unintelligible text> came in, they brought the
<unintelligible text> out. The <unintelligible text> then came up to the Dumont tunnel on
account of the Robinson lumber job at quicksand. They had a depot there. That was is far
as the road came at that time. Then about 1928 they took the track out and abandoned the
depot.
