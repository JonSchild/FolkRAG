Dear f
rozen Fellows:
 
Perhaps t
his gambit does not apply where you l
ive, but I
 t
hink i
t
 will s
trike a
 
c
hord f
or t

f us dwelling t
his winter on t
he East Coast and t
hereabouts.
 
Apologies f
or being s
o l
ong i
n s
ending t
he enclosed Minutes f
rom t
he Luncheon a
t
 
t
he AFS Annual Meeting i
n Eugene and t
he ballot. Thanks f
or your patience —I
 
r
eceived only one guilt-inducing i
nquiry (
thanks f
or t
he push, E
lliott).
 
Those o
f you who were not able t
o j
oin u
s i
n Eugene missed a
 c
ouple o
f
 
memorable events. E
lliott Oring delivered with aplomb a
 l
ively Fellows Lecture
 
entitled "
The Arts, Artifacts, and Artifices o
f I
dentity" t
o a
 packed house, and t
he
 
r
esponses by Henry Glassie and Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett were a
lso quite
 
s
t
imulating. The i
deas p
resented by our t
hree d
istinguished Fellows t
hat Thursday
 
c
ontinued t
o r
everberate t
hrough t

f t

 am sure t

Henry f
or s

hat note, I
 
would l
ike t
o mention t
hat our e
steemed P
resident Barre Toelken began t
he event
 
by o
ffering a
 humorous overview o
f t
he h
istory o
f t
he AFS Fellows with s
uperb wit
 
and i
ntelligence. The meeting o
f t
he Fellows held during t
he l
uncheon t
he
 
f
ollowing day must a
lso c
ertainly r
ank among t
he most s
t

r
egarding t

The Fellows voted on a

egarding e

a
l
l o
f which would c
onstitute c

t
 was
 
decided t
hat t
hey s

t t

f

t

even new nominations were
 
added t

lthough t

Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett: Admitting two more F

* = In 1982, the Fellows approved a change in the by-laws, article 4
, paragraph d,
 
to read as indicated above.  Prior to the time of the change, the sentence followed
 
by the asterisk read as follows:
 "A fifty percent vote of the full membership is
 
needed for election."
 
In 1976, the Fellows approved a voluntary annual fee of $5.00 for all Fellows until
 
they reach the age of 70.
 
In 1979, the Fellows set student paper prize awards at $50.00, $25.00, and honorable
 
mention.  There was no indication that this �
,ould necessarily continue in subsequent
 
years. 
In fact, the practice has varied considerably.  In 1982, for example, the
 
first prize (
shared by two individuals) was $100.00 and the second prize was $75.00.
 
In 1983, three cash awards were given in the amounts of $75.00 (
first prize), $50.00
 
(
sec

third prize).
