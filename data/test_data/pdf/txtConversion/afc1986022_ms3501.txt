ICA 001---W129 <unintelligible text> Salmon, ID---9/1/81 Hunting narratives---
<unintelligible text> Tape 1 of 2
18 Why the family came to Montana (not enough game in Missouri)
55 Story about why he quit school -an altercation with an algebra teacher (he had frozen
his feet while hunting coyotes and missed two weeks of school; she would not let him
make up the work). Collocated with another story about a fight with a fellow student, also
in the algebra class. The school principal commended him privately for beating up the
other kid
90 "I run cattle for about thirty years" -also hunted. Coyote hides are worth $100 each for
their fur, which is used for linings and coats
110 How he became interested in hunting--both his father and his grandfather were
hunters. He shot small game age 9 with a muzzle-loader
125 Always interested in guns. An aunt gave him a doll as a gift, but he destroyed it and
"went back to playing with shotgun shells." (Toddler.)
130 Details of the hideous flu epidemic of 1918, Helena (brother killed)

170 His first bear? "I don't remember when I did kill my first one." Describes packing for a
hunting party as a young boy
190 Severe winter 1919-20. He skinned dead horses and cattle. The skins sold for $12
each (money scarce). Severely chapped hands. <unintelligible text> "He's a graduate of
the school of hard knocks."
210 I ask about his son's first kill (both parents were present). My intention is to lead up to
blood ceremonies
225 Funny story about son <unintelligible text> meeting up with a large bear face to face--
Ted got a perfect shot.
238 I ask about blood ceremony. "I've never heard of it." Later: "It may be an Indian
custom."
253 He killed 2 bear before he married. <unintelligible text> mother roasted them.
<unintelligible text> "They were delicious."
260 Story. Grizzly hunt in Alaska. The 12-foot grizzly charged him, yet he remained calm.
It took several shots to kill the bear. (Technical terms re guns--interesting esoterically to
hunters). The hide was no good. I ask whether he was frightened. He says he remained
calm. "Danger always made me cool and calculating."

314 Close calls: Mexico, four men threatened him and his hunting companions. A gunfight
almost happened.
<unintelligible text> cont'd---page 2
*325 Story: Gunfight in Missoula (<unintelligible text> had told us about this one). (This
is the first time <unintelligible text> almost weeps.) Detailed description of setting of gun
battle. He was a paper-boy. Describes his part in notifying authorities, covering the doors,
helping make funeral arrangements.
*398 Immediate collocation with a story about an Irish lady beating her husband. The
sherrif offered to take him off her hands (laughs and laughs).
*417 Memory of first airplane in Missoula, 1915
*425 Collocated story: First automobile, description
*430 Collocated story: Chinatown. "Lot of chinks"-<unintelligible text> imitates the speech
of a Chinese in the story (sounds like a traditional imitation to me) re the first automobile
451 I ask re the Chinese in Helena. He tells a story about a Chinese buried along the
Salmon River with a gold nugget in his hand-later other Chinese exhumed him, took the
gold, and sent the body back to China. The Chinese were all over the west in mining
camps, salvaging gold
471 Description of Chinese matches -best ones. (Tape ends in mid-discussion.)

03 More info on Chinese: "They done all the dirty work. . . . They were mistreated
mostly. . . . Pretty highly respected . . . honorable people."
*12 Imitation of speech of Chinese vegetable vendors in Missoula
*20 Story of how he and some friends as kids tried to pan gold in a "China-man's" garden
stream--they got shot at. "They were honest people"
29 I ask about the most dangerous situation he was in. Cougar story. He was killing deer
for a widow with nine children. The cougar savaged part of the kill. He went after the
cougar. Took pictures while under threat from the cougar.
*76 Trapping a bobcat in Montana, another close call. "I was just a kid. . . . That was too
close for comfort."
90 I ask about hunting camps. Cook-tent, tepees. Whoever cooked: "He didn't enjoy it, but
it had to be done." Dutch oven cooking.
108 <unintelligible text> tells funny story about his awful pancakes. <unintelligible text>
"They were only fit to nail over a rat-hole." He retells the same story in greater deail.
(Essentially, a dog refused to eat them)
117 I fish for "Good, though" stories. None forthcoming.
131 A friend of his killed 2 grizzly yearlings and their dam. <unintelligible text> filmed.

<unintelligible text> cont'd---page 3
140 Another grizzly story. The bears were feeding on salmon (Alaska) under a waterfall.
Again, he tried to take pictures, but no time.
158 Another grizzly story. (All of these describe how many bullets were required for the kill,
and where they were placed.) One of his companions went up to the grizzly thinking it was
dead, but it wasn't dead--this frightened him and he somersaulted quite a distance.
190 Barb asks for description of "a good hunter." "I wouldn't know where to start."
"Average intelligence," training,guts. Stamina helps, but "you've gotta learn the habits of
the game--and move quietly."
200 Elephant-huntingstory. Africa. Also a rhino. It charged <unintelligible text> while he
<unintelligible text>) was caught in brush. Elaborate describtion of the shots required to kill
the rhino.
232 <unintelligible text> almost weeps again for the black African safari men. "Black--but
they couldn't help it."
240 Long story dating from 1925 about his father and another man hunting on the Lochsa.
A bargain that whoever got the first elk would be exempted from cooking and washing
the whole trip. <unintelligible text> introduces this story and participates in the telling.)
<unintelligible text>, who was along, spotted an elk for his father in dim light. His father
tended to get excited, but <unintelligible text> contrived to prevent this. Long narrative,
sub-stories. The father got the first elk.
336 I ask re hunters' pranks. "Sometimes, but poor business. . . . They better leave the
tomfoolery at home."

345 Barb asks re exaggerations about kills: "Same of em are as bad as fishermen."
353 I ask for Munchausens- none forthcoming, though he has heard of them
363 His longest shot: a buck at 600+ yards (2 stories collocated)
*380 Another long-shot story. Hunting deer with a young companion. Tells how he
compensated for length of shot by adjusting his use of the inadequate sights. The 600+-
yard shot got a 400-pound buck elk.
420 One elk he bagged dressed out at 400 pounds.
438 I ask for comparison of elk and deer. Elk are much smarter, except in rutting season.
But then deer are dumber in that season too. "They've got the feminine idea on their mind
and nothing else."
454 I ask about tricks elk play to evade hunters. Story, 1918. The cow elk kept playing
peekaboo from behind trees for two hours. Collocation: Story about a smart buck elk.
478 He took so many photos while hunting because he wanted to sell articles
