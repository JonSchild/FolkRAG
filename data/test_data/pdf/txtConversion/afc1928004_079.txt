THE UPPER TEN. 
Written, Composed and Sung by W. II . 
L1NGARD. 
Like famous Jack Brag, that dashing blade, 
Who lived in be-gone days, 
Disgusted with my father's trade, 
Mysel I 
sought to raise 
High in this fashionable world 
So when my father died, then 
I 
spent the cash I'd earned by work, 
Amongst the upper ten. 
Spoken—Yes, the gov'nor kept an oil and color store in 
Fulton street, but, of course, I 
never talked shop— 
CHORUS. 
When I 
belonged to the upper ten, 
The upper ten, the upper ten, 
Such handsome women and jolly men, 
We swells of the upper ten thousand. 
My style of dzes, as you may see! 
Is always quite correct. 
Park loungers stop to look at me, 
My costume to inspect; 
" 
Whose that man's tailor ?” I 
oft hear 
Remarked by envious men ; 
They took me for " ten thousand a'year" 
Among-t 
the upper ten. 
When I 
belonged, itte. 
But runnireg short of cash I 
tried 
My fortune to recruit, 
By looking round me for a 
wife, 
And soon found one to suit; 
THE UPPER TEN.—[roxcLuDED.] 
A. lovely young Fifth Avenue belle, 
Rich, idolized by men, 
Oh, lucky chance by which I 
fell 
Amongst the upper ten. 
And she belonged, &c. 
She spoke about my family, 
'Twas rather awkward ground, 
For in Debrett my pedigree, 
Can not be be plainly found ; 
But toll her mine was Norman blood, 
And satisfied, she then 
said she'd be mine, and with me shine 
Amongst the upper ten. 
And we both belonged, etre.. 
One day, as we both down Broadway strolled., 
By chance I 
met a -friend, 
-Who'd known me and my dad of old, 
His hand he did extend. 
"How's business, what's the price of oils 
He shouted out, and then 
I 
felt it was all up with me, 
Amon 1st the upper ten. 
s.p'oken—It ruined me; and you should have seen her, as, 
she looked into my face, her eyes filin r 
fire,atal all that sort 
of thing, she said— 
I 
thought you belonged, &c. 
THE COMET OF THE WEST'. 
Sung by the GREAT L:NGARD. 
I'm the ccmet of the west, 
ln the shade 1 
put the rest, 
All ot hers are my sat elites, you see, 
But in,,onttes s 
not. my g-ame, 
I've 
way 0 fame, 
And they all have to stand. aside for me.. 
Shout boys, shout, and let's, be jolly, 
Staul aside and let this swell g p:st. 
I 
like to do the grand with a 
sh , 
it cane in my hand,. 
For, by J v, you see the comets come at last; 
In Fifth Avenue i 
shine, 
With this taking way of mine, 
And i 
in Central Park I 
eliteice to ride, 
1Nly horse holds up his head, 
As though lie proudly said— 
". The comet comes! you fellows stand aside." 
Shout, boys, shout,, &c 
At a 
theatre or a 
ball. 
Or at supt)er One and all, 
To stair: aside. for me find it best, 
For my most impressive way 
ruts them down and seems to say— 
" 
Stand aside, I 
am the comet of tl:e west I" 
Shout. boys, shout, &a. 
If by clemm I'm at a 
rrce. 
In the stand I 
get a 
place, 
No matter what the crowd or who are there, 
It will always be my pride, 
That I 
make them stand aside, 
There' s 
no resisting my important air. 
Shout, boys, shout, &a. 
Every greenroom I 
do know, 
Behind OIL) saines I 
often go, 
And I 
always come off better than the rest; 
The ballet all know me, 
And each pretty star you see 
Is attracted by the comet of the west. 
Shout, boys, shout, &o. 
Though other stars may fall, 
I 
shin brighter than them all, 
And the comet's shining splendor is its pride. 
Your applause then kindly lend, 
For my tale is at an end, 
The comet of the west comes, stand aside. 
Shout, boys, shout, &e.

THE MARSEILLAISE HYMN. 
Ye sons of France, awake to glory; 
Hark, luau Ii. what myriads bid you rise; 
Your chi'dren, wives and glandstres hoary— 
Beho1d 11.e.ar teats and 
ear dicer cries, 
Shall hatefu: tyranny ini,4litef breeding, 
With hireling ho . ts. a 
ruffian band, 
Affright and desolate the land, 
While peace and liberty lies bleeding. 
('HO It US 
To arms, to arms, we brave ! 
The avenging sword unsheath 
March on : march on' all hearts resolved 
On liberty or death. 
Now, now, the treacherous storm is boiling ,
- 
Which treacheroui kin .:s confederate raise, 
The dogs of war. let loose are howling; 
And lo, our fields and cities b:aze , 
And shall we basely view the rum. 
While lawless force, with gui.ty strife, 
Spread desolation far and wide, 
Wilt crime and blood bus arms imbruing! 
To arms, &c. 
With luxury and pride surrounded, 
The vii 
instantly despots are, 
Their thirst of power and gold unbounded, 
To mete and vend the light and air : 
Like beasts of burden would they load us, 
Like gols would bid their slaves adore; 
:But man is man. and who is more 
Then shall they longer lash and goad us ? 
To arms, &e. 
Oh, Liberty, can man resign thee, 
Once haying fit thy generous flame ? 
Can dungeons, bolts or bars confine thee? 
Or whips thy noble spirit tame 
-Too long the world has wep7. bewailing 
That falseho ,d 
s 
daggers tyrants wield; 
But freedom is our swol .d and shield, 
And all their arts are unavailing. 
To arms, ttc.

S I 
met shooting stars who were bent upon sport., 
But who " shot" in a 
very strange manner I 
thought; 
And one thing beat all by chalks I 
must say, 
That was when I 
got into the Milky Way; 
I 
counted the stars, till at last I 
thought, 
Id found out how much they were worth by the quart, 
An unpolite "21erolite" who ran 'gainst my car, 
Wouldn't give "e'er a 
light," to light my cigar. Whilst up, dm 
4 
Next a 
comet went by 'midst fire like hail, 
To give me a 
lift, I 
seized hold of his tail, 
To where he was going I 
didn't enquire, 
We'd gone past the moon, till we couldn't get higher; 
Yes, we'd got to the furthermost!! don't think I 
joke, 
When somehow I 
felt a 
great shock-I 
awoke! 
When instead of balloon, moon and planets, I 
saw, 
I'd tumbled from off of my bed to the floor. 
aorus.-And there was no balloon,-there was no balloon, 
There were not any planets, and there wasn't any moon, 
So never sup too heavy, or by jingo very soon, 
You're like to fancy you are going up in a 
balloon.

STATUES. 
Sung by the GREAT LINGARD. 
Permit me here to represent 
Some great and noble men, 
My photographic studio, 
I 
trust may pleasure give, 
For ever in our memory 
These noted, men all live. 
First the Corsican Brothers, 
As on the stage they burst. 
There is a 
very cutting scene between 
Fabian and the ghost. 
When Fabian aces his brother's ghost, 
It fills his breast with wo..? ; 
And when he goes to seal the letter, 
I 
think he stood just so. 
A statue now l'il show you, 
Beloved by every one, 
The father of the nation, 
The great George Washstngon. 
May many follow in his path, 
And to their country prove no foe, 
So hail Columbia's warrior, 
As I 
represent him so. 
Now we have Mayor Hoffman, 
Who has dello ' all be can 
To stop the great excise law, 
And aid the working man. 
.de's an able politican, 
And has gained himself applause. 
So T 
think now here you'll give a 
cheer 
For T-Toffman and his cause. 
Then there's General 
S. Grant, 
As I'm about to show.. 
Who led his troops to !,•
lory, 
And struck terror to the foe. 
If any foreign enemy, 
His trumpet dares to blow, 
Well find him once more in the front, 
Standing, I 
think, just so.

BEEF, PORE., YarTTOINT, WILL YOU IIUY. 
There was a 
butcher boy, boy, boy, 
Who a ≤virl did much anoy-noy-noy, 
By winking at her his eye, 
And wheneTer she came to his shop, 
To purcha ,e 
a 
steak or a 
nice lean chop. 
CHORUS. 
He cried—beef, pork, mutton, will you buy, buy, buy, 
Beef, pork, mutton, will you buy, 
He love for her did feel, feel, feel, 
Which love he did re-veal, veal, veal, 
And heaved full many a 
sigh; 
Then falling down upon his knees, 
Her hand with rapture he did seize, 
And cried— beef, pork, &e. 
Now a 
smart young brother had she, she, she, 
Who had lately ecme from sea, sea, sea, 
Where he di.1 the waves defy ; 
He is sister embraced without delay, 
Unto the butcher's great dismay, 
Who cried—beef, pork, &c. 
He did not know 'twos her brother, brother, brother, 
But thought of lovers ' twos another-nother-nother. 
So fate he did defy, 
And he walked up to the sailor—who gave him a 
frown. 
But instead of directly knocking him down— 
He cried—beef, pork. &c. 
Then the butcher whetted his knife, knife, knife, 
Resolved to take the life, life, life, 
Of the treacherous girl so sly ; 
So by the hair he caught the maid, 
And after flourishing the blade, 
He cried—beef, pork, &c. 
The sailor coming in like a 
brick, brick, brick, 
Saluted the butcher uith a 
Isiek. kick, kick, 
Which lifted him three fee hi2h; 
And when recoverin ,, from the shock. 
Ile directly ran behind his b'ock, 
And cried— beef, pork, &e. 
Thus being bereft of hope, hope, hope, 
He went and bought a 
rope, rope, rope. 
Resolved that he would die ; 
But a 
1 
explained—became his wife, 
And in Washington Market he still sharps his knife. 
Crying—beef, pork, &-c. 
COME, HASTE TO THE WEDDING. 
Come, haste to the wedding, ye friends and ye neighbors, 
The lovers their biiss can no longer delay ; 
Forget all your sorrows, your care, and your labors, 
And let every heart beat with rapture to-day; 
Ye votaries all, attend t) my call, 
Come, revel in pleasure ,. 
that never can cloy, 
CRORUS—Gune, see rural felicity, 
Which love and innocence ever enjoy. 
Let envy, let pride, let hate and ambition 
Still crowd to anti beat at the breast of the great: 
To such wretched passions we give no aditaission, 
But leave them alone to the wise ones of state. 
We boast of no wealth, but contentment and health, 
In mirth and in friendship, our moments employ. 
Come, see rural felicity, &c. 
With reason we taste of each heart- stirring pleasure, 
With reason we drink of the full flowing bowl; 
Are jocund and gay, but all within measure, 
For fatal excess will ensia,ve the free soul. 
Then come at our bid ling, to this happy wedding, 
No care shall intrude our bliss to annoy. 
Come, see rural felicity, &c.

THE LANCASHIRE LASS.—[coNcLunr.n.] 
The way that I 
won her is strange you will say, 
'Twas one afternoon that I 
went to Bellevue, 
A 
young friend of mine was there for the day, 
And took little Polly for whom he'd to pay; 
When first we met I 
soon could see, 
That with his ohance 'twas all U. P. 
And so I 
asked her if she'd have me, 
This beautiful Lancashire Lass. 
My Lancashire Lass, &e. 
She said " she'd be mine" and she swore to be true 
We've since been like doves, bilLng and cooing! 
We never fall out as some lovers do, 
And she has some money, betwixt me and you; 
She bought this watch which now I 
wear, 
If she don't mind, well I 
don't care, 
She says " that her fortune I 
shall share," 
My beautiful Lancashire Lass. 
My Lancashire Lass, lte. 
She's published the banns, were going to be wed. 
I 
leave those matters for her to settle, 
To-morrow, for time so quickly has fled, 
The Lancashire Lass to the church will be led ; 
I 
need not work whilst there's a 
purse, 
To the idea I'm not averse, 
And p'rhaps one day I 
may have to nurse, 
A sweet little Lancashire Lass. 
My Lancashire Lass, &C.

THE ROLLICKING RAMS. 
Button up your waistcoat, button up your shoes, 
Have attother liquor and throw away the blues, 
Be like me and good for a 
spree, 
Fr,m  now till the day is dawning, 
For I 
am a 
member of the rollicking rams, 
C. me and be a 
member of the rollicking rams, 
The only biys to make a 
noise, 
From now till the day is dawning. 
We scorn such drinks as lemonade, Soda, seltzer, beer. 
'1 lie liquors of our club I'd tell to you, 
But I 
ein't, for there's ladies here. 
Come along, come along, come along, 
CHORUS. 
For I 
am a 
member of the rollicking rams, 
Come and be a 
member of the rollicking rams; 
Out all night till broad daylight, 
And never go home till morning! 
When once you're a 
member of the rollicking rams, 
All things real, we have no shams, 
Except Champagne, good Champagne, 
We drink till the day is dawning ; 
In till the pockets of the rollicking r 
ms, 
Each one puts a 
bottle of Cham. 
And on some doorstep sit and drink, 
Till daylight in the morning. 
With a 
pocket full of money the Police make right, 
To what we do they're blind, 
Such as pulling down bells and breaking lamps, 
For which we should be fined, 
Come along, come along, come along. 
For I 
am a, &c. 
The Milkman in the morning he knows us rams, 
-We follow up behind him and empty the cans, 
Which down the area he has put, 
For breakfast in the morning. 
-Upset a 
coffee stall as we go home, 
With is our landladies pick a 
bone, 
And get kicked out of house and home, 
Without a 
moment's warning; 
But we don't care we're single men, 
Not hampered with a 
wife. 
So DOW my friends if you like the style, 
Come and spend a 
noisy life, 
Come along, come along, come along, 
For I

UNDER THE WILLOW SHE'S SLEEPING. 
Words and Music by S. C. FOSTER. 
Under the willow she's laid with care— 
Sang a 
lone mother while weeping, 
Uncle- the willow, with golden hair, 
My little one's quietly sleeping. 
CHORUS. 
Fair, fair, and golden hair. 
Sang a 
lone mother while weeping ; 
Fair, fair, and golden hair, 
Under the willow she's sleeping. 
Under the willow no songs are heard, 
Near where my darling lies dreaming; 
Naught but the voice of some far-off bit d, 
-Where life and its pleasures are beaming. 
Fair, fair, &c. 
Under the willow, by night and day, 
Sorrowing ever I 
ponder; 
Free from its shadowy, gloomy ray, 
Ah! never again can she wander. 
Fair, fair, &c. 
Under the willow I 
breathe a 
prayer, 
Longing to linger for ever 
Near to my angel with golden hair, 
In lands where there's sorrowing never. 
Fair, fair, &c.

That have bloomed in the summer of my heart.

Shall we never more behold thee, 
Never hear thy winning voice again, 
'When the spring-time comes, gentle Annie, 
'When the wild flowers are scattered o'er the plain ? 
We have roamed and loved 'Death the bowers, 
When thy downy cheeks were in bloom ; 
Now I 
stand alone 'midst the flowers, 
While they mingle their perfumes o'er thy tomb. 
Shall we never more, &c. 
Ah, the hours grow sad while I 
ponder. 
Near the silent spot where thou art laid, 
And my hart bows down when I

By the streams and meadows where we stray'd.

MY Bop:m/1 FRIEND. 
Sung by the GREAT LIN GA RD. 
I 
had a 
bosom friend, whose name, 
Like mine, was Tommy Brown; 
We both at once loved Sarah Jones, 
The finest girl in town. 
But slyly I 
the quastion popped, 
Saying, " Tommy Brown wilt wed?" 
The license if my friend would get 
She'd be married to me, she said. 
Oh, on the twenty-fifth of May, • 
Oh, dear, I 
felt so gay, 
Oh, my heart is palpitating 
While the kindness fm relating, 
Of Tommy Brown, my bosom friend. 
Now I 
thought that Vother Tommy Brown 
Would be, without a 
doubt, 
Annoyed, because with Sarah Jones, 
rd slyly cut him out. 
But no. he said he'd be best man, 
And firmly my hand shook, 
AnI to make the little arrangements 
For my wedding undertook. 
Oh, on the twenty-fifth of May, dte. 
lie got the license for me, 
And bespoke the coaches, too, 
The wedding-breakfast ordered, 
And invited all I 
knew; 
And as my business kept me from 
My S 
rah, late at eve, 
He kindly shopping with her went— 
Such friendship, who'd believe. 
Oh, on tht, tks enty-fifth of May, cto. 
NY BOSOM FRIEND—[CONCLUDED.) 
When the morning came I 
could not rest, 
I 
feared to be too late, 
By eleven I'd to be at church, 
But was up and dressed by eight. 
A coach my friend Tom went to fetch, 
But eleven Caine and passed, 
Still Tom did no return, therefore 
I 
ran to church at last. 
Oh, on the twenty-fifth of May, &e. 
I, warm and dusty, reached the church, 
And looked for Sarah, when, lo! 
The parson said se married was, 
At le st one hour ago. 
I 
ran frum church to Sarah's house, 
But found she'd just left town, 
Having with tile license married 
My namesake, Tommy Brown. 
Oh, on the twenty-fifth of May, &e. 
What's in a 
name ? I've somewhere read, 
Well, this much let me say, 
I 
know that for my name of Brown 
l'd many Browns to pay. 
So, young men, when engaged to wed, 
Upon yourselves depend, 
Nor leave your little arrangements 
To any bosom friend. 
CHORUS. 
Or on the twenty-fifth of May, 
You'll clearly have to pay. 
For if you timidly fiddle faddle, 
Your loving bride will skedaddle 
With some obliging bosom friend.

TENTING ON THE OLD CAMP GROUND. 
We're tenting to-night on the old camp-ground, 
Give us a 
song to cheer, 
Our weary hearts, a 
song of home 
And friends we love so dear ! 
CHORUS. 
Many are the hearts that are weary to-night, 
Wishing for the war to cease: 
Many are the hearts looking for the right, 
To see the dawn of peace: 
Tenting to-night, tenting to-night, 
Tenting on the old camp-ground. 
We've been tenting to-night on the old camp-ground, 
Thinking of the days gone by: 
Of the loved ones at home, that gave us the hand. 
And the tear that said: Good-bye! 
Many are the hearts, & c. 
We are tired of war on the old camp-ground: 
Many are dead and gone, 
Of the brave and true, who've left their homes: 
Others have been wounded long. 
Many are the hearts, & e. 
'We've been fighting to-day on the old camp-ground: 
Many are lying near, 
Some are dead, and some aro dying, 
Many are in tears 
CHORUS. 
Many are the hearts that are weary tonight, 
Wishing for the war to cease; 
Many are the hearts looking for the right, 
To see the dawn of peace : 
Dying to-nig,ht, dying to-night, 
Dying on the old camp-ground.

YrIgliraITOE BOUGH, OR, OLD OAK Gil. 
The Mistletoe hung in the castle ; 
The holly branch shone on the old oak wall; 
And the Baron's retainets were blythe and. gay, 
And keeping their Christmas holiday; 
The Baron beheld, with a 
father's pride, 
His beautiful child, Lord Lovell's bride, 
While she with her bright eye, seemed to be, 
The Star of that goodly company: 
Oh! the Mistletoe Bough I 
Oh ! the Mistletoe Bough 1 
Tin weary of dancing now, she cried, 
Pray, tarry a 
moment, I'll hide, I'll hide. 
And, Lovell, be sure thou'rt the first to trace, 
The clue to my secret lurking place. 
Away she ran, and her friends began, 
Each tower to search, each nook to scan; 
In the highest, the lowest, the loneliest spot, 
'Young Lovell sought wildly, but found her not, 
Oh! the Mistletoe Bough : Oh: the Mistletoe Bough. 
They sought her that night, they sought her next day 
They sought her in vain when a 
week passed away, 
And young Lovell cried: Oh ! where (lost thou hide? 
l'm lonely without thee, my own dear bride. 
And years flew by, and the story at last, 
Was told as a 
sorrowful tale long past; 
And, when Lovell appeared, the children cried: 
See, the old man weeps for his fairy bride, 
Oh, the Mistletoe Bough! Oh, the Mistletoe Bough. 
At length, an old oak chest, that had long laid hid, 
Was found in the Castle: they opened the lid, 
And a 
skeleton fTusrri lay mouldering there, 
In the bridal wreath of a 
Lady fair. 
Oh, sad was her fate, when, in sporting jest, 
She hid, from her Lord, in the old oak-chvst ! 
It closed with a 
spring, and her bridal bloom. 
Lay withering there, in a 
living tomb ! 
Oh, the Mistletoe Bough: Oh, the Mistletoe Bough.

THE PRIVATE STILL. 
An Exciseman once in Brooklyn at the time that I 
was there, 
He fancied that a 
private still was being worked somewhere ; 
He met me out one morning, he fancied that I 
knew, 
But I 
didn't—never mind that—says he, Pat, how do you do ? 
Pal de ral, &c. 
says I, I'm very well, your honour, bui allow me for to say, 
I dont know you at all, by jove! but, says he, perhaps 
you may ; 
I 
want to find something out, assist me if you will, 
Here's filLy dollars if you can tell me where's a 
private still. 
Pal de ral, 
Give me the fifty dollars, says I, upon my soul I 
can, 
I'll keep my word, the devil a 
lie, as I'm an Irishman ; 
The fifty dollars he then put down, I 
pocketed the fee, 
Says I, now button up your coat and straightway follow me. 
Pal de ral, &c. 
I 
took him walking up the street, and talking all the while, 
He little thought I'd got to take him a 
thund'ring many miles; 
Says he, how much farther, Pat ? for I 
am getting very tired, 
Said. I, then let us have a 
ear, and. a 
jaunting car he hired. 
Pal de ral, & c. 
As soon as we got in the ear, said he, now tell me, Pat, 
Where is this blessed private still ?—don't take me for a 
fiat, 
A 
fiat, your honour, no, says I, but hear me if you will 
And I 
at once will tell you, sir, where there's a 
private still.

THE PRIVATE STILL. [CoNTINuED.] 
Go on at once, says ho, said I, all right—now mark well, 
I 
have a 
brother that is close by here, in the barracks he does 
dwell, 
I 
assure you he's a 
soldier, though he went against his will; 
The devil take your brother, says he, where s 
the private still ? 
Pal do ral, &c. 
Hold your wist I 
says I, old chap, and I 
will plainly show, 
That in the army, why, of course, promotion is very slow; 
Said. the Inspector, yes, I'm sure it 
is, they're only meant 
to kill, 
But never mind your brother, tell me where's the priva`e still. 
Pal de ral, &c. 
Said. I, I'm coming to it—the barracks close at hand, 
And if you look straight through the gates, you'll see and hear 
the band; 
And when the band's done playing, you'll see the soldier's 
drill— 
blazes take the soldiers! tell me where's the private still ? 
Pal de ral, &c. 
Half a 
minute more, says T, I'll point him out to you— 
Faith, there he is, says I, old chap, standing 'twixt them two. 
Who the blazes do you mean ? said he •, I 
said, my brother 
Bill, 
Well, says he; well, says I, they won't make hizn a 
corporal, 
so he's a 
private still! 
Pal de ral, &c. 
The Inspector stamped and—and said he'd have his money 
back ; 
But I 
jumped in the car myself, and off was in a 
crack. 
And the people as he walks along, tho' much against his will, 
Shout after him—Inspector, have you found the private still ? 
Pal de ral, &e.

sAD,Airs YOUNG MAN. 
My first love was Sarah, oh ! none could be fairer 
Than she was, in fact, I've neer seen one so fair; 
On her I 
got love-sick, she was a 
domestic, 
And lived at a 
Mansion in Madison square. 
ne'er can forget her: the first time I 
met her, 
As she out of the house for the dinner-beer ran, 
'Twas love at first sight, for, on that same night, 
with joy, was accepted as Sarah's young man. 
I 
oft got invited to tea, and delighted 
I 
felt at the welcome she always gave me, 
While sipping our Souchong, we'd talk of affection, 
And how I 
enjoyed the hot muffits for tea. 
The setvants were Sukey, a 
very fat cookey; 
Jemima, the house-maid; and kitchen maid Fan. 
And as one may sup,)ose, they all had their beaux; 
But no one was favor, d 
like Sarah's young man. 
Unexpected, one night, I 
called, when a 
sight 
Met my view, that I 
scarce could believe my own eyes, 
But, alas! ' twas too true, there, a 
big soldier in blue 
Sat quite cozy with Sarah, who stared with surprise, 
And. when I 
demanded a 
true explanation, 
Of such heartless conduct, Miss Sarah began, 
To laugh and grow boldcr, while her great, clumsy soldier, 
Seized hold of the collar of Sarah's young man. 
Sa d 
he, cooly, to me, Your not wanted, you see, 
If you'll quietly take my advice, you'll walk out. 
Said I: If I 
do, by Juve, you'll go too. 
When the monster began for to knock me about, 
SARAH'S YOUNG MAN. [CoNcLuDED.I 
While strugglnig, we both heard the voice of the master, 
The soldier, with fright, up the area-steps ran, 
While I, soon as abie crawled under the table, 
A 
nice situation for Sarah's young man. 
Well, down came the master; but before him much faster, 
Came a 
nasty black poodle, who scampered about, 
I 
trembled with fear, whene'er it came near, 
And, dreading it find my hiding-place out; 
My breathing I 
smothered, but alas! was discovered, 
For the poodle a 
sniffin and barking began, 
The master he lifted the cloth from the table, 
And dragged out, from under it, Sarah's young man. 
My feelings that moment, I 
cannot decribe them, 
My looks, I 
am sure, must have been most absurd, 
I 
glanced at my captor, then trembled and stammered; 
Tito' trying to speak, I 
could not say a 
word. 
The master he tightened his hold of my collar. 
Saying: who and what are you ? speak out, if you can, 
A 
thief •or a 
lover ?— Said 1, with a 
stutter; 
No, no, no, if you please, sir, I'm Sarah's young man. 
I 
gave to the master all due explanation ; 
He then let me go, and thus ended my fright, 
Miss Sarah, of course, she lost her situation, 
And also her soldier, which served her quite right. 
The last time we met, she was full of regret,

But said I: Oh, no ! fools often fall 'tween two stools, 
And I'm happy I'm no longer Sarah's young man.

DEAR MOTHER I'VE COME TO DIE. 
Words by E. 
BOWERS. 
M USIC 
by H ENRY TUCKER. 
Dear Mother, I 
nmember well 
The parting kiss you gave to me, 
When merry rang the village bell; 
My heart was full of joy and glee; 
I 
did not dream that one short year, 
Would crush the hopes that soar'd so high! 
Oh! Mother dear, draw near to me, 
Dear Mother, I've come home to _die. 
Call sister, brother, to my side, 
And take your SJ1dier's last Good-bye, 
Oh! Mother dear, draw near to me, 
Dear mother, I've come home to die. 
Hark! Mother, 'tis the village bell, 
I 
can no longer with you stay: 
My Country calls, to arms! to arms! 
The foe advance in fierce array! 
The vision's past, I 
feel that now, 
For Country I 
can only sigh; 
Oh! Mother de ar, draw near to me, 
Dear Mother, I've come home to die. 
Call sister, brother, &o. 
Dear Mother, Sister, Brother, all, 
One parting kiss to all: Good-bye ! 
Weep not! but clasp your hand in mine, 
And let me like a 
soldier die! 
I've met the foe upon th3 field, 
Where kindred fiercely did defy, 
I 
fought for right, God bless the Flag! 
Dear, Mother I've come home to die ! 
Call sister, brother, &c. 
BROTHER'S FAINTING AT THE DOOR. 
Yonder comes a 
weary soldier, 
With falt.ring steps across the moor; 
Merdries of the past steal o'er me: 
He totters to the cottage-door. 
Look! my heart can not deceive me: 
'Tis one we deemed on earth no more, 
Call Mother, haste, do not tarry, 
For, Brother's fainting at the door. 
CHORUS. 
Kindly greet the weary soldier, 
Words of comfort may restore, 
You may have an absent Brother, 
Fainting at a 
stranger's door. 
Tell us, Brother, of the battle, 
Why you were numbered with the slain; 
We, who thought you lost forever, 
N ow clasp you to our arms again ; 
Oh I 
may others share the blessing, 
Which Heaven kindly keeps in store : 
May they meet their absent loved ones, 
Ay, & en though fainting at the door! 
Kindly greet, cto. 
I 
was wounded and a 
pris'ner, 
Our ranks were broken, forced to fiy; 
Thrown within a 
gloomy dungeon, 
Away from friends, alone to die. 
Still the hope was strong within me, 
A cherished hope that would restore: 
I 
have lived, by Heaven's blessing, 
To meet my loved ones at the door. 
Kindly greet, cba.

Sure, the nightingale's notes are delightful, 
When he warbles, at night, in the wood, 
And if birds taught us colleen's love's language, 
lie's the sweet little Birdie that could, 
But it wasn't from him I 
learnt singing, 
Not from nightingale, no, nor from dove; 
'Tins my heart in my voice makes the music, 
When I 
see the dear Boy that I 
love. 
Is it lonely ye are thei (te. 
Then, my Darling, oh! speak not of sorrow, 
To her heart's core your Norah is true, 
She knows, Dennis dear, that you love her, 
And, Dennis, you know she loves you. 
And would ye then wait till to-morrow ? 
While the moon shines in heaven so bright, 
And the lane and the kiss so convanient, 
Won't I

WRITE A LETTER TO MY MOTHER. 
Words by E. BOWERS. 
Music by P. B. IsAAEs. 
An Officer, captured at the battle of Bull-Run, relates the 
following incident. 
After our capture, I 
observed a Fed-
eral prisoner tenderly cared for by a 
rebel soldier. 
I 
gleaned, 
from their conversation, that they were brothers. 
The brave 
boy, while battling for the Union, received his death-wound 
from his own brother, at that time a 
private in the rebel ranks. 
Never shall I 
forget the look of utter despair depicted upon 
that rebel's face ; the dying boy, with a 
smile of holy resigna-
tion, clasped his brother's hand, spoke of their father who was 
then fighting for their dear old flag, of mother, of home, of 
childhood—then, requesting his brother to '
write a 
letter to 
mother, and imploring him never to divulge the secret of his 
death, the young hero yielded up his life. 
Raise me in your arms, my brother, 
Let me see the glorious sun; 
I 
am weary, faint and dying, 
How is the battle—lost or won ? 
I 
remember you, my brother, 
Sent to me that fatal dart : 
Brother fighting against brother, 
'Tis well—'tis well that tlins we part. 
MI-OXUS. 
Write a 
letter to my mother, 
Send it when her boy is dead: 
That he perished by his brother: 
Not a 
word of that be saidl 
Father is fighting for the 'Union, 
And you may meet him on the field: 
Could you raise your arm to smite him ? 
Oh ! could you bid that father yield 
He who loved us in our childhood, 
Taught the infant prayers we said 
Brother, take from me a 
warning, 
I'll soon be numbered with the dead. 
Write a 
letter, &c. 
Do you ever think of mother, 
In our home within the glen, 
Watching, praying for her children ? 
Oh! would you see that home again? 
Brother, I 
am surely dying, 
Keep the secret—for, ' tis one, 
That would kill our angel mother, 
If she but knew what you had done!

letter, &c.

The Prisoner's HOpe. 
In the prison-cell I

Thinking, Mother dear, of you, 
And. our bright and happy home, so far away. 
And the tears they till my eyes, 
Spite of all that I 
can do, 
Tho' I 
try to cheer my comrades and be gay.

Tramp, tramp, tramp! the boys are marching, 
Cheer up! comrades, they will come, 
And beneath the Starry Flag, 
We shall breathe the air again, 
Of the Free-land in our own beloved home. 
In the battle-front we stood, 
When their fiercest charge they made, 
And they swept us off, a 
hundred men or more; 
But, before we reached their lines, 
They were beaten back dismayed, 
And we heard the cry of Vicery, o'er and o'er. 
Tramp, tramp, tramp! &c. 
So, within the prison-cell, 
We are waiting for the day 
That shall come to open wide the iron door.; 
And the hollow eye grows bright, 
And the poor heart almost gay, 
As we think of seeing home and friends, once more.

For we knew that want and woe 
We no longer should endure,

On, on, on, the boys came marching, 
Like a

And we're safe at home again, 
And the cause we've fought and suffered for is won ;

'Mid our woes and ' mid our pain, 
How the glorious Union boys came tramping on.

Yes, yes, yes, the boys came marching, 
Like a

And they dashed away the guard from the heavy iron door,

Parson said it was for life,

She is frightful if she cannot have her way.

Not a

ask to drink, 
If I 
do, the rolling pin she at me throws; 
And her aim is pret ty sure, 
If I 
don't make for the door, 
She is safe to crack my skull or break my nose. 
Tramp, tramp,&c. 
Every night she goes away 
To the music hall or play, 
And I 
know she's with companions not a 
few; 
For she cuts it very fine, 
Drinking ale, and gin, and wine, 
And comes rolling home about the hour of two. 
Tramp, tramp, &c. 
If she would but shortly croak, 
I'd the hat-band buy and cloak, 
Get an onion just to water well my eye; 
And they'll know it's but a 
sham, 
For only too glad I 
am, 
When her nose and toes are turned up to the sky.

Still upon the field of battle 
I

And many more are faintly calling,

And how at first sight fall in love, 
When e'er they pass that way, 
But a

And, as I 
looked, my fate was booked, 
I

I 
found that I 
had fell in love 
With a 
dark and roguish eye. 
Her dress was in the fashion cut, 
Hooped up so gay and neat, 
And as she went to cross the way, 
I 
saw her pretty feet, 
By chance she dropped her handkerchief, 
'Twas marked L-u-c-y; 
I 
picked it up, she thanked me with 
A 
dark and roguish eye. 
I 
never can forget her, &e. 
Of course, this little chance I 
took, 
We walked and talked awhile, 
She said her father he was rich, 
He lately had struck Re.

exclaimed: Will you be mine? 
Her fellow he came by; 
Walk off! he said, or I'll give you

WHEN THIS CRUEL WAR IS OVER. 
Words and Music by H ENRY TCCKER. 
Dearest love, do you remember 
When we last did meet, 
How you toll m that you loved me, 
Kneeling at my feet 
Oh! how proud you stood before me, 
In your suit of blue, 
When you vow'd to me and country, 
Ever to be true. 
CHORUS. 
Weeping, sad and lonely, 
Hopes and fear, how vain ; 
Yet praying, when this cruel war is over, 
Praying: that we meet again! 
When the summer breeze is sighing, 
Mournfully, along ! 
Or when autumn leaves are falling, 
Sadly breathes the song. 
Oft, in dreams, I 
see thee lying 
On the battle plain, 
Lonely, wounded, even dying, 
Calling, but in vain. 
Weeping, sad and lonely, eze. 
If, amid the din of _battle, 
Nobly you should fall, 
Far away from those who love you, 
None to hear you call: 
Who would whisper words of comfort, 
-NVho would soothe your pain ? 
Ah ! the many cruel fancies, 
Ever in my brain. 
Weeping, sad and lonely, &e, 
But our country called you, darling, 
Angels cheer your way; 
While our nations's son's are fighting, 
We can only pray. 
Nobly strike for God and liberty, 
Let all nations see 
How we love our Starry Banner,

I KNOW MY MOTHER'S HAND. 
Words by W. DEXTER SMITH, J . 
IISIC 
by HENRI' TECKER. 
In one of our late battles a 
young lieutenant had his right 
foot so shattered by a 
fragment of a 
shell that, on reaching 
Washington after one of those horrible ambulance rides, and 
a journey of a 
week's duration, he was obliged to undergo 
amputation of the leg. 
He telegraphed home, hundreds of 
miles away, that all was going well, and with a 
soldier's forti-
tude composed himself to bear his sufferings alone. 
Unknown to him, however, his mother, one of those dear re-
serves of the army, hastened up to join the main force. 
She 
reached the city at midnight, and the nurses would have kept 
her from him until morning. 
One sat by his Ade fanning him 
as he slept, her hand on the feeble, fluctuating pulsations which 
foreboded sad results. 
But what woman's heart could resist 
the pleadings of a 
mother then? In the darkness she was 
finally allowed to glide in and take the place at his side. 
She 
touched his pulse as the nurse had done. 
Not a 
word had 
been spoken; but the sleeping boy opened his eyes and said: 
"That feeL3 
like my mother's hand! 
Who is 
this be 
side me ? 
It is my mother; turn up the gas, and let me see 
mother I" 
The two dear faces met in one long, joyful sobbing embrace, 
and the fondness pent up in each heart sobbed and panted and 
wept forth its expression. 
The gallant fellow, just twenty-one, his leg amputated on the 
last day of his three years service, underwent operation after 
operation, and at last, when death drew nigh, and he was told 
by tearful friends that it only remained to make him comfort-
ble, said: " he had looked death in the face too many times 
to be afraid npw," and died as gallantly as did the men of the 
Cumberland. 
Thro' the darkness I 
have listened,' 
For the music of her voice, 
For the gentle words of comfort, 
That would make my heart rejoice 
All the weary hours I've counted, ' 
Measured o'er and. o'er again, 
Yet no Mother came to cheer me, 
Or to soothe my throbbing pain. 
I 
have prayedl she might be near me 
Ere I 
seek that other Land, r 
And I 
feel she is beside me, • 
For I 
know my mother's hand-

WHEN JOHNNY COMES MARCHING HOME. 
Hark I 
hear familiar footsteps, 
And a 
well-remembered sigh, 
Bringing back the distant moments, 
When youth's changeful hours went by; 
And I 
feel the gentle pressure, 
On my brow, thy kisses fanned, 
Yes I 
know she is beside me, • 
I 
can feel my mother's hand. 
I 
have prayed, 6,:c. 
Mother! yes, it is my mother, 
She is here beside me now, 
In the world there is no other, 
Who can calm my burning brow; 
Let me look upon her features, 
Which I 
oft with love have scanned, 
Oh! I 
know it is my mother, 
For I 
feel her gentle hand. 
I 
have prayed, &c. 
WHEN JOHNNY COMES MARCHING HOME. 
When Johnny comes marching home again, hurrah, hurrah 
We'll give him a 
hearty welcome then, hurrah, hurrah: 
The men will cheer, the boys will shout I 
The ladies, they will all turn out, 
And we'll all feel gay, 
When Johnny comes marching home. 
The old church-bell will peal with joy, hurrah, hurrah 
To welcome home our darling boy, hurrah, hurrah! 
The village lads and lasses say 
With roses they will strew the way, 
And we'll all feel gay, 
When Johnny comes marching home. 
Get ready for the Jubilee, hurrah, hurrah! 
We'll give the hero three times three, hurrah, hurrah I 
The laurel-wreath is ready now 
To place upon his loyal brow, 
nd we'll all feel gay, 
When Johnny comes marching home. 
Let love and friendship, on that day, hurrah, hurrah 1 
Their choicest treasures then display, hurrah, hurrah! 
And let each one perform some part, 
To fill with joy the warrior's heart, 
And we'll all feel gay, 
When Johnny comes marching home.

KITTY WELLS. 
You ask what makes this darkie weep, 
Why he like others am not gay, 
What causes the tear to flow down his cheek, 
From early morn till close of day. 
My story, clarkies, you shall hear, 
For in my memory fresh it dwells, 
It will cause you all to drop a 
tear 
On the grave of my sweet Kitty Wells. 
While the birds were singing in the morning, 
And the myrtle and the ivy were in bloom, 
And the sun on the hill was a 
dawning, 
It was then we laid her in the tomb. 
I 
never shall forget the day, 
That we together roamed the dells, 
I 
kissed her cheek, and named the day 
That I 
should marry Kitty Wells. 
But death came in my cabin door, 
And took from me my joy and pride, 
And when I 
found she was no more, 
I 
laid my banjo down and cried. 
While the birds, & c. 
I 
often wish that T 
was de ad, 
And laid beside her in the tomb. 
The sorrow that bows down my head 
Is silent in the midnight gloom. 
The spring time has no charm for me, 
Though flowers are blooming in the dells, 
For that bright form I 
do not see, 
'Tis the form of my sweet Kitty Wells. 
While the birds, &c.

ONE AT HOME WHO PRAYS FOR ME, 
OR, 
WHO HAS NOT A PRAYING MOTHER ? 
W ords by HExuy. M. 
Iluar. 
M usic by H ENRY TUCKER. 
At midnight, on my lonely beat, 
When shadow wraps the wood and lea, 
A 
vision seems my view to greet 
Of one at home who prays for me; 
No roses bloom upon her cheek, 
Her form is not a 
lover's dream, 
But o'er that brow so pure and meek, 
A thousand holier beauties gleam. 
CHORUS. 
Who has not a 
praying mother, 
Wheresoe'er his lot may be! 
Ey'ry wand'rer feels in darkest hour 
There's one at home who prays for me. 
How softly shines her silver hair, 
A patient smile is on her face, 
And that mild lustrous light of prayer 
Around her sheds a 
moonlike grace; 
She prays for me so far away— 
The soldier in his holy fight 
And begs that Heaven in mercy may 
Protect her boy and bless the right! 
Who has 
Still though the leagues lie far between, 
This silent incense of her heart 
Steals o'er my soul with breath serene, 
And we no longer are apart; 
So guarding thus my lonely bet 
By shadowy wood and haunted lea, 
That vision seems my view to greet 
Of her at home who prays for me. 
Who has not, &c.

THE MOTHER'S PRAYER. 
Words by G EORGE COOPER. 
Music by J. R. 
The Sun is drooping down the West, 
The little birds have gone to rest, 
And little feet have weary grown, 
And mother watches all alone. 
While fondly bending o'er her child, 
To pleasant land of dreams beguiled, 
Oh, softly sweet is uttered there, 
In pleading words the mother's prayer: 
" 
Oh, sleep, my little darling, sleep!, 
While evening shadows o'er thee creep— 
For He who marks the sparrows flight 
Will keep my babe from harm to-night." 
How fondly 'mid her joys and fears, 
The mother waits the coming years, 
For little feet may go astray, 
And wander from the narrow way. 
That angel-hands may shield his life, 
Amid the never-ending strife,— 
That love may banish pain and care, 
Is all the mother's earnest prayer. 
Tr:tomes. 
" 
Oh, sleep, my little darling, sleep! 
While evening shadows round thee creep— 
For He who marks the sparrow's flight, 
Will keep my babe from harm to-night. 
Will keep my babe front harm tc-night."

FARE THEE WELL! THE CHAIN IS BROKEN. 
Written by M ISS SKYNNER. 
Composed by JUIN DANIEL. 
Fare thee well! the chain is broken, 
Fortune beams upon thy brow, 
Those fond words in sorrow spoken, 
Rest not in thy memory now; 
Gay and lovely friends above thee 
Pleasure's fairy garlands twine, 
May their bosoms beat to love thee 
With a 
faith as deep as mine I 
May their bosoms beat to love thee 
With a 
faith as deep as mine! 
CHORUS. 
Pare thee well! the chain is broken 
Fortune beams upon thy brow, 
Those fond words in sorrow spoken, 
Itot not in thy memory now! 
Think not of me while glances 
O'er thy path Joy's dazzling beam, 
And thy light bark gaily dances 
Down life's bright and sunlit stream; 
But should pain and woe o'ertake thee, 
And thy gay companions flee, 
Love and Joy and Hope forsake thee, 
Then, oh ! then, remember me! 
But should Joy and Hope forsake thee, 
Then, oh ! then, remember me! 
Fare thee well! the chain, &e.

MARY OF THE WILD MOOR. 
It was on one cold winter's night, 
As the wind blew across the wild moor, 
When Mary came wandering home with her babe, 
Till she came to her own father's door. 
Oh, father, dear father, f- he cried, 
Come down and open the door, 
Or this child in my arms will perish and die, 
By the wind that blows across the wild moor. 
Oh, why did I 
leave this dear spot, 
Where once I 
was happy and free ? 
But now, doomed to roam without friends or home, 
And no one to take pity on me. 
The old man was deaf to her cries; 
Not a 
sound of her voice reached his ear; 
But the watch-dog did howl, and the village bell tolfd, 
And the wind blew across the wild moor. 
But how must the old man have felt, 
When he came to the door in the morn, 
Poor Mary was dead, but the child was alive, 
Closely pressed in its dead mother's arms. 
Half frantic he tore his gray hair, 
And the tears down his cheeks they did pour. 
Saying, this cold winter's night, she perished and died, 
By the wind that blew across the wild moor, 
The old man in grief pined away, 
And the child to its mother went soon; 
And no one they say, has lived there to this day, 
And the cottvge to ruin has gene, 
The villagers point out the spot, 
Where the willow droops over the door, 
Saying, there Mary died, once a 
gay village bride, 
By the wind that blows across the wild moor!

JUST BEFORE THE BATTLE, MOTHER. 
Just before the battle, Mother, 
I'm thinking most of you, 
While, upon the field, were watching, 
With the enemy in view. 
Comrades brave are round me lying, 
Filled with thoughts of home and God; 
For, well they know that, on the morrow, 
Some may sleep beneath the sod. 
CHORUS. 
Farewell! Mother, you may never 
Press me to your heart again, 
But oh! you'll not forget me, Mother, 
If I'm numbered with the slain 1 
Oh! I 
long to see you, Mother, 
And the loving ones at home: 
But I'll never leave our Banner, 
Till in honor I 
can come. 
Tell the traitors, all around you, 
That their cruel words, we know, 
In ev'ry battle kill our soldiers, 
By the help they give the foe. 
Farewell! Mother, &c. 
Hark! I 
hear the bugles sounding: 
'Tis the signal for the fight, 
Now may God protect us, Mother, 
As he ever does the right! 
Hear the " Battle-cry of Freedom," 
How it swells upon the air! 
Oh ! yes, we'll rally round our Standard, 
Or we'll perish nobly there! 
Farewell! Mother, &c.

MAID OF ATHENS. 
Maid of Athens, ere we part, 
Give, oh! give me back my heart, 
Or, since that has left my breast, 
Keep it now, and take the rest, 
Hear my vow, before I 
go, 
My life, my life, I 
love thee. 
By those tresses -unconfined, 
Woo'd by each Aigean wind, 
By those lids whose jetty fringe 
Kiss thy soft cheek's blooming tinge, 
By those wild oyez . like the roe's, 
My life, my life I 
hiNe thee. 
Maid of Athens, I 
am gone, 
Think of me sweet, when alone, 
Though I 
fly to Istamboul. 
Athens holds my heart and soul, 
Can I 
cease to love thee 
No. 
My life, my life, I 
love thee.

To sing about my name and occupation.

SHE'S HANDSOME AS A ROSE. 
OR, SHE WAS SUCH A CHARMER. 
I'll sing to you a 
song, 
And try to please you all, 
It's about a 
yellow charmer 
I 
met at a 
fancy ball, 
She was handsome as a 
rose, 
Her eyes were black as sloes, 
And when upon her I 
did gaze, 
She stole my heart away. 
CI-TORT:S. 
Oh! she was such a 
charmer, 
I 
had her for a 
partner, 
She was handsome as a 
rose, 
Her eyes were black as sloes, 
And when upon her I 
did gaze, 
She stole my heart away. 
Now, I 
will her describe, 
As I 
met her at the bail, 
She'd a 
boxing glove upon her head, 
Meant for a 
waterfall, 
Her waist was tall and slender, 
Her feet like a 
giraffe, 
And when she took a 
promenade, 
She made the darkies laugh. 
Oh I 
she was, &o. 
I 
took her to her home 
And lingered at the door, 
Oh 1 
there I 
felt so happy, as 
I'd never felt before I 
I 
asked her mine to be; 
She only gave a 
smile, 
But her eyes they pierced me thro' and thro', 
I 
know she'll yet be mine. 
Oh 
she was, etc.

COME HOME, FATHER. 
Words and Music by HENRY CLAY W ORK. 
Father, dear father, come home with me now, 
The clock in the steeple strikes one; 
You said you were corning, right home from the shop, 
As soon as your day's work was done. 
Our fire has gone out, our house is all dark, 
And mother's been watching since tea, 
With poor brother Benny so siek in her arms, 
And no one to help her but me. 
Come home ! come home! come home! 
Please, father, dear father, come home! 
CHORUS. 
Hear the sweet voice of the child, 
Which the night- winds repeat, as they roam!, 
Oh ! who could resist this most plaintive of prayers; 
Please, father, dear father, conic home 
Father, dear father, come home with me now, 
The clock in the steeple strikes two; 
The night has grown colder, and Benny is worse 
But he has been calling for you: 
Indeed he is worse, ma says he will die— 
Perhaps before morning shall dawn 
And this is the message she sent me to bring 
Come quickly, or he will be gone! 
Come home! come home! come home! 
Please, father, dear father, come home 
Hear the sweet voice, &e. 
Father, dear father, come home with me now, 
The clock in the steeple strikes three; 
The house is so lonely, the hours are so long 
For poor weeping, mother and me! 
Yes, we are alone ; for Benny is dead, 
And gone with the anc-els of light. 
And these were the very last words that he said: 
I 
want to kiss papa good-night. 
Come home! come home! come home! 
Please, father, dear father, come home !: 
Hear the sweet voice, &c. 
iitei414. 
FATHER'S COME HOME, 
A sequel to: " Come Home, Father.” 
Yes, Mary, my Mary, your father's come home, 
You waited through all the long night, 
He was deaf to your pleadings, for, reason was drowned. 
But, oh! it came back with the light. 
It seems like a 
dream, oh! a 
terrible dream— 
But, alas ! now I 
know it was true : 
Poor Benny is dead, but your father's come home, 
Dear Mary, to mother and you. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! no more, through the dark, weary hours, 
Little Mary in sadness shall roam, 
Ah! how glad to her ears are the words which she hears: 
Dear Mary, your father's come home! 
Please, Mary, tell mother that father's come home, 
And kneels by our little boy's bed; 
And he prays for God's help, that the husband may fill 
The place of the boy that is dead ; 
And say, though he left her forsaken to weep, 
All alone to bear sorrow and pain, 
He'll never more cause her a 
pang or a 
tear, 
If once more she will trust him again. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! no more shall the wife watch and weep, 
All in vain for the loved one to come; 
And all gone are her fears, as the iessage she hears 
Tell mother that father's come home. 
Yes, Mary, tell mother that father has left 
The drink that has made him so bad; 
You can say he has taken the Temperance-Pledge, 
I 
know it will make her heart glad ; 
And tell her he waits to clasp mother and child, 
And vo, on his knees, to be true ; 
For father's come home, to his reason, at length, 
Dear Mary, to mother and you! 
CHORUS. 
Oh! no more, to the mother and child, 
Shall the night black and desolate come— 
For, the fire shall be bright, and their hearts shall be light, 
While saying: Dear Father's come home I

Come Hume, Father." 
Mother, dear mother, come home with me now, 
The clock it is just striking ten; 
Poor father has 1 
boured this day for us all, 
And needs the rest, God gave to men. 
He comes home at eve with a 
sigh from his heart. 
Since mother you daily act so, 
Your poor little children go short through your ways, 
For Chink will crush all down with woe. 
CHORUS. 
Come home, come come, come home, 
Dear mother, dear mother, come home. 
Mother, dear mother, come home with me now, 
This sad state indulge in no more, 
And show to your children you cannot still drink, 
And leave them all garbless and poor; 
Return with me now, father sends me to you, 
Indeed, dearest mother, I 
see 
Your ways %yin be bringing him down to the grave, 
This moment come home with me. 
Come home, &c. 
Mother, dear mother, come home with nie now, 
We can't get poor Willie to bed; 
He tells us he's waiting your face there to see, 
While low, weary droopeth his head.

don't be severe, but pity our state, 
And give up for ever the sin; 
So shall we find joy where there only was grief, 
And peace our bright dwelling within. 
Come home, tkc 
MEET ME IN THE LANE. 
Composed by CHARLES BLAMPHIN. 
I'll meet thee in the lane, 
When the clock strikes Nine, 
In ecs'-,acy again, love, 
To call thee mine. 
My heart for thee is burning, 
My brain is almost whirling. 
Thro' loving thee so madly, 
My sweet Mountain Rose: 
When evening stars are peeping, 
Oh! then will be our meeting, 
Old time too swiftly fleeting 
Our happy time away. 
I'll meet thee in the lane, 
When the clock strikes nine, 
In ecstacy- again, love, 
To call thee mine. 
My heart for thee is burning, 
My brain is almost whirling, 
Thro' loving thee so madly, 
My sweet Mountain Rose. 
CHoltUS. 
I'll meet thee in the lane, 
When the clock strikes nine, 
In ecstacy again, love, 
To call thee mine, 
My heart for thee is burning, 
My brain is almost whirling, 
Thro' loving thee so madly, 
My sweet Mountain Rose. 
I'll leave thee in the lane, 
When the clock strikes Ten, 
And faithful will remain, love, 
Believe me then : 
Deceive thee I 
I 
will never. 
And breath from me must sever, 
If I 
forget thee ever, 
My sweet Mountain Rose I 
Thy presence care dispelling, 
All other charms excelling, 
Oh! what to grace my dwelling 
As thee my Mountain Rose. 
Then meet me in the lane, &c.

'TIS BUT A LITTLE WORD. 
BALLAD. 
Composed by ARTHUR W . 
HAWTHORNE. 
'Tis but a 
little word, but, oh, 
How sorrowful the tone, 
When losing all that life held dear, 
We say we are alone. 
When every link that bound the heart 
Has parted one by one, 
And none are by to turn the glass 
As out life's quick-sands run. 
'Tis but a 
little word, oh ne'er 
May it be spoke by me, 
I 
only ask for life while I 
May share my heart with thee. 
To catch thy glance, to hear thy cry, 
Till feeble be its tone, 
To watch thy latest light fade out, 
Nor then to be alone. 
The sun must set, the day decline, 
So we must fade at last, 
The strongest tree must fall before 
The storm's repeated blast. 
As pines the bird whose gentle mate, 
To other climes has flown, 
My heart would break if thou wert dead, 
1 
could not live alone.

THE WEARING OF THE GREEN.

Theatre, hi the Great Sensation- Play oi

Arrah-na-Pogue."

Paddy dear, and did you hear the news that's going round 
The shamrock is forbid, by law, to grow on Irish ground! 
No more St. Patrick's day we'll keep, his color last be seen; 
For, there's a 
bloody law agin the Wearing of the Green! 
Oh! I 
met with Napper Tandy, and he took me by the hand, 
And he says: How is Ould Ireland, and how does she stand ? 
She's the most distressed Country that ever I 
have seen: 
For, they are hanging men and women for the Wearing of the 
Green! 
And since the color we must wear, is England's ernel red, 
Ould Ireland's sons will ne'er forget the blood. that they have 
have shed. 
Then take the shamrock from your hat, and cast it on the sod.: 
It will take root and flourish still, tho' under foot 
is trod. 
When the law can stop the blacks of grass from growing as 
they grow. 
And when the leaves, in summ6... time, their verdure does not 
show. 
Then, I 
will change the color I 
wear in my cabbeen: 
But, till that day, plaze God! I'll stick to the Wearing of the 
Green ! 
But if at last, her colors should be torn from Ireland's heart 
IIer sons, with shame and sorrow, from the dear old soil will 
part; 
I've heard whispers of a 
Country that lies far beyond the say. 
Where rich and poor stand equal, in the light of Freedom's 
day!

Erin! must we lave you, driven by the tyrant's hand ? 
Must we ask a 
Mother's blessing, in a 
strange but happy land, 
Where the cruel Cross ofEnodan.d's thraldom never shall be seen 
And where thank God! we'll live and die, still Wearing of the 
Green?
