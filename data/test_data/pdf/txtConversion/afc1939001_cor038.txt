[Letter from Harold Spivacke to John A. Lomax;
Huntsville, TX]
May 13, 1939
Mr. John Lomax Huntsville, Texas
Dear Mr. Lomax:
Thank you for your nice letter of May 9. I was very pleased to hear that everything is going
so well on your present trip. You may be surprised to hear it from me but the fact remains
that both Lomaxes constitute the smoothest running part of the Division at the present
moment!
Have you heard the Lead Belly album which Alan edited for Musicraft? I consider it a
splendid job.
I am sorry that Dornbusch has caused you any embarrassment but I appreciate your
sending me Broome's letter. I shall know better how to handle the matter from now on.
Sincerely yours,
Harold Spivacke Chief, Division of Music
