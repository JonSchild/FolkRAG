Fuller and WarrenCome all you young, you royal rovyers rovers,Once I was as brisk as you;But all
for the sake of an English lady,A gentleman of note I slew.She was young, airy and handsome,Lately
from old England came.I courted her and gained her fancy,Kathrine Farrer was her name.A ring I
gave, and a pledge of marriage;She the same did gladly take.But, alas, she being fickle-minded,Her
solemn vow she then did break.She formed an acquaintence with former Warren.He unto this
fickle dame did say,"Oh, Fuller's a rake and a rambling follow.Take my advice, send him away."The
ring was returned unto me,Closely confined in a letter of Warren's writing.I swore revenged on
him I'd be.Then my papers I did get ready,And unto Warren I did say,"Come, go with me unto your
office;My business there I can't delay."He being in a pleasant humor,He walked alone and stepped
before.I followed him so closely after,And immediately did shut the door.Then my papers I did
present him,Saying, "Sir, to this you set your name,And own yourself a base deceiver;To the English
lady quit all claim."He smilingly refused to sign it.Then my pistols I did present,Saying, "Take your
choice:Defend yourself, for to take your life is my intent!" * 2 2 of 2Fuller and WarrenHe smiling said,
"You are in romance.You could not think to break my rest."This more enraged my malicious humor;I
instantly shot him through the breast.In the year one thousand eight hundred and twentyJanuary
the tenth day,My pistols being close confinedWhich made a low and a solemn sound.
