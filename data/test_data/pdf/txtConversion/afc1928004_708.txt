"ANYTHING." 
I'vE got a 
song called " Anything," and if you'll lend your ear, 
I'll try and sing it to you ; ' tis sure your heart to cheer ; 
It's about a 
horse, a 
dog, a 
cat, a 
man, a 
boy, a 
baby, 
A 
sealskin sacque, a 
pretty girl, and other topics, maybe ; 
Always chew your own tobacco, never norrow, lend or steal, 
Always make your mush and milk, of milk and Injin-meal ; 
Always treat the ladies kindly, never kiss them on the sly, 
Big pig, little pig, root, hog, or die. 
A 
horse that trots in " two-eighteen" is no mean thing to urive, 
And an English pug, led by a 
string, is just " too sweet to 
live ;" 
A 
cat that sings the tenor, in a 
back-yard opera-bouffe, 
Brings a 
man out with a 
boot-jack to chuck down from the roof; 
A 
boy with a 
slender appetite would surely be a 
sight, 
And a 
baby to be a 
thing of joy must soundly sleep at night; 
A 
sealskin sacque will never make 11 pretty girl of a 
guy, 
Big pig, little pig, root, hog, or Ma. 
Adam was a 
Dutchman, and so was Eve: too ; 
They sold lager beer on Sunday, and paddled their own canoe; 
Cain killed his brother Abel, but he wasn't put in jail; 
Jonah was a 
fisherman, he swallowed up a 
whale. 
Dar's a 
hop-toad in de garden, teasing bumble bees; 
A 
nigger in de wood-pile, with a 
toothpick stabbing fleas ; 
De hornet's on de grindstone sharpening up his sting, 
And I'm breaking up my jaw for you, a-singing anything. 
I'LL MEET HER WHEN THE SUN 
GOES DOWN. 
Words and music by Wm. W ELSH. 
Music published and copyrighted, 1SS2, by the Chicago Music Co., 
Chicago, Ill., and sent postpaid on receipt of 40 cents. 
IN 
an ivy-covered little cot, 
About a 
mile from town, 
Dwells a 
maiden that I 
dearly love, 
And I'll meet her when the sun goes down. 
Her cheeks are like the red, red rose, 
And her hair is a 
beautiful brown, 
She's the idol of this darkey's heart, 
And I'll meet her when the sun goes down. 
CHORUS. 
And its oh, how I 
love pretty little :Mary, 
She's the keeper of a 
dairy, 
Oh, how I 
love. 
And I'h. meet her when the sun goes down. 
In the evening when my work is done, 
With my true love I'm sure to be found,. 
In a 
quiet little nook by the babbling brook 
I'll meet her when the sun goes down. 
When Sunday comes we'll take a 
walk, 
In the woods well roam around. 
Next Sunday at nine I'll call her mine, 
We'll be married when the sun goes down. 
And its oh, how I 
love, etc.

GOING TO THE SHUCKING. 
THE ZOOLOGICAL DAMSEL. 
BANJO SOLO. 
Sung by EDWIN FuExcu, San Francisco Minstrels. 
THERE'S a 
gal lives in this city 
Of a 
very peculiar shape, 
She's something like a 
lizard, 
Or a 
big Brazilian ape; 
Her hair is full of feathers, 
And the color of a 
mole, 
And she carries in her slippers 
A 
couple of tons of coal. 
CHORUS. 
For she's so obtropulous, all the way from Indianapolis, 
Her nose, like a 
barber's pole, red, white and blue, 
And she could hold faster than a 
big mustard plaster, 
She'd skip o'er the gutters like a 
lame kangaroo, 
She was born way down in China, 
And you ought to see her laugh, 
She'd shake the freckles off her face, 
Stretch her neck like a 
giraffe ; 
She used to be a 
mummy, 
And her daddy was a 
miller; 
She followed Barnum's circus, 
And was mashed on the gorilla. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, she WaS so lanky, egotistical and cranky, 
Site wore a 
big blanket to cover her breath; 
AllY " Murphys " 'tvould puzzle when beholding her 
guzzle; 
She could talk any deaf and dumb feller to death. 
She had her picture taken 
On a 
slice of Switzer cheese, 
So each time that you beheld' it 
You'd get a 
healthy breeze. 
She'd make a 
meal of garlic, 
And if you ever got a 
whiff 
You can bet your bottom dollar 
It would knock you cold and stiff. 
CHORUS. 
I 
repeat quite emphatic that she was a 
loon-a-tic— 
Her head it was hollow and light as a 
cork; 
She's a 
dismal old " corpus "—graceful as a 
porpoise--
In walk and in talk she' a big Jersey gawk.

BLNCE MICHAEL LEARNED TO DANCE. 
Sung by JOHN KERNELL. 
M Y 
name it is O'Donovan, 
I 
live in Jersey City, 
I 
have three boys, and four big girls, 
On me they have no pity ; 
My eldest boy's about nineteen, 
He sings a 
song called " Dancing on the Green," 
Not a 
clay's luck in the house is seen 
Since Michael learned to dance. 
He has all the boys and girls taught 
To waltz around upon their toes ; 
He practised kicking yesterday noon, 
And busted all his clothes ; 
He comes from the theatre about daylight, 
And says with the actors he had a 
terrible fight, 
The house is a 
circus from morn till night, 
Since Michael learned to dance. 
He brought home stuff he called burnt cork, 
Which he says he got at the play halls ; 
He broke the clock, 
Trying to stand on his head; 
While he done some funny falls; 
As an actor he says he's great, 
My family to Hoboken must emigrate, 
Since Michael learned to dance. 
He calls his sister a 
leading lad 
He wrote a 
drama, called the " Stolen Cheese," 
He played a 
year at Sing Sing, 
Doing a 
cornet solo upon a 
high trapeze; 
The manager told him to write again, 
He doubled up with Geo. Francis Train, 
Be4,-forra, I 
have water on the brain, 
Since Michael learned to dance.

YOUR POCKET-BOOK IS YOUR BEST FRIEND. 
Words by ARTHUR W . 
FRENCH. 
Music by A. CULL. 
The music of this song is published by E. H. HARDING, 
Bowery, X. Y. 
Price 10 cents. 
THERE are friends you deem true, they will linger near 
you, 
In the flush of prosperity's hours, 
But in poverty's day they will vanish away, 
Like the fading of summer's sweet flowers. 
As you journey along in life's turbulent throng, 
While the hill sides you climb or descend, 
You will see it some day, I 
am right when I 
say 
That your pocket-book is your best friend; 
That your pocket-book is your best friend. 
CHORUS. 
'Tis a 
friend that you need, and a 
true friend indeed, 
Ever ready to give or to lend; 
For wherever you go, you will find it is so, 
That your pocket-book is your best friend; 
That your pocket- book is your best friend. 
Our political life is nothing but strife, 
Where all honor is swallowed in gain ; 
But to hint such a 
thing to a 
man of the ring, 
Why of course they would call you insane. 
Many a 
man is in power at this very same hour 
That our honest votes never would send ; 
And the way it is done is quite plain to each one, 
Why their pocket-book was their best friend. 
'Tis a 
friend, etc. 
-/ 
There's a 
gay young cashier, wiTh a 
thousand a 
year, 
And his horses and ladies and wine, 
Oh, he goes at a 
rate quite alarming to state, 
. 
Though he draws on a 
very big mine. 
They discover, some day, he has gambled away 
Many thousands or more, and the end 
Is, they give him a 
year, after that he gets clear, 
For his pocket-book is his best friend. 
'Tis a 
friend, ete. 
PEEK-A-BOO! 
Words and music by Wm. J. SCANLON. 
Tilige published by T. B. H A 
rtms & Co., 819 Broadway, New York. 
Ox a 
cold winter's evening, when bus'ness is done, 
And to your home you retire, 
What a 
pleasure it is to have a 
bright bouncing boy, 
One whom you love to admire ; 
You hug him, an1 kiss him, you press him to your heart, 
What joy to your bosom ' twill bring I 
Then you place him on the carpet, and you'll hide behind 
the chair, 
And to please him you'll commence to sing: 
CHORUS. 
Peek-a-boo! peek-a-boo! 
Come from behind the chair ; 
Pock-a-boo ? peek-a-boo 1 
I 
see you hiding there, 
Oh! you rascal, there. 
Oh, my heart'fi. 
ways light when at home with my wife, 
There joy and peace ever reign ; 
With my boy on my knee I'm as happy as can be, 
I 
never know care or pain ; 
He's pretty, he's gentle, he's kind and he is good, 
And ev'rything nice him I 
bring ? 
Oh, if he attempts to cry when I 
am standing by, 
Just to please him I 
commence to sing: 
Peek- a-boo ! etc.

Bromfield Street, Boston, Mass. 
Copyrighted, 188.:1, by W. A. Evans & Bro. 
My sweetheart's a 
shy little fairy, 
Her age it is just seventeen, 
Her parents think that she's too airy. 
But a 
sweeter girl never was seen. 
At night she steals out from the cottage, 
Her mother cries after her " Kate," 
She answers, " Dear Ma, I'm not going far, 
I'm just going down to the gate! 
CHORUS. 
I'm just going down to the gate, dear Ma, 
Just down to the old garden gate. 
The moon is so bright, and its such a 
nice night., 
just go as far as the gate. 
Of course at the gate I 
am waiting, 
And sweet are the words that we say, 
While inside the old folks are debating, 
As to whether they'll move first of May. 
Sometimes they call gently for Katie: 
She answers, " Dear Ma, 'tis not late, 
There's no sign of a 
storm, and the night is so warm, 
I 
love to stand here by the gate! 
I'm just going down, etc. 
They say she's too young to be married,— 
But with them we de not agree; 
Love's message to Katie I 
carried, 
And a 
kiss was the ausl-ver for me. 
We'll wander alone in the moonlight,— 
Much longer I'm sure we can't wait— 
Some night, by and by, to the preacher we'll fly, 
When Katie comes down to the gate! 
I 
am just going _down, &c.

in their hab-its, And 
they 
all have a mate but me. 
The first on the page is little Sally Sage, 
She once was a 
lady's maid; 
But she ran away on a 
very dark day, 
With a 
fellow in the fried fish trade. 
The next was a 
Cook, oh! a 
beauty with a 
hook, 
And I'll tell you the recson why! 
For a 
leg she'd a 
stump, on her hack was a 
hump, 
And she'd got a 
little squint in her eye !—Cuo. 
3 
Another One to charm was a 
Girl on a 
farm, 
Well versed in the harrows and ploughs; 
She guarded the rigs of a 
lot of little pigs, 
And squeezed new milk from the Cows. 
She was sixteen stone all muscle and bone, 
And she looked with an awful leer; 
And she would have been mine, but fell in a 
decline, 
Thro' swallowing a 
mouse in her beer !—Cuo. 
Then another one came, ah, a 
right jolly Dame, 
And her purse was as long as my arm, 
All full of yellow gold, such a 
sight to behold ! 
Would the heart of a 
miser warm. 
And her only sin was a 
love for gin, 
But it brought our hopes to a 
wreck; 
For she slipp'd with her heel on a 
bit of orange pee], 
Fell down and broke her blessed neck.—Cno. 
5 I 
could add to the store full a 
half dozen more, 
For the list is a 
long way round; 
One went o'er the sea for a 
better chap than me, 
And some of them were hanged or drowned. 
And the last I 
had through drink went mad, 
In vain I 
tried to stop her: 
And sad was my dismay to discover that one any, 
she'd been slowly boiled to death in the Copper.

A ROW OF TENEMENT HOUSES. 
Originally sung by the swell comedians, NILES and Evixs. 
Aut.—" Blue Alsatian Mountains." 
IN 
a 
row of tenement houses, 
Lived a 
damsel young and fair; 
Her papa wore the trousers 
When her mamma wasn't there. 
Maiden with a 
dimpled eyebrow, 
With a 
voice so young and fair, 
Maiden with a 
yaller 
That followed her everywhere. 
Each day, each day, each day, 
Some family would move away. 
For that row of tenement houses 
Never seemed to please or pay. 
To that row of tenement houses 
Came a 
granger in the Spring, 
Just to talk of sheeps-and cowses, 
And to hear that maiden sing ! 
Just to hear that maiden sing. 
Oh, he spoke about his barnyard, 
Of his chickens and his bog ; 
But she thought he was giving her taffy, 
So she called her yaller dog. 
Hurra ! hurra ! hurra ! 
That granger he ran away, 
But left the bosom of his trousers

Well, if that's Mr. Reilly they speak of so highly, 
Well, upon me soul, Reilly, you're doing right well.

THE FUN AT JOHNSON'S BALL. 
Written by LEW DREWS, and performed successfully by the Two 
REEDS. 
Goon evening, white folks, we've come to make 
call, 
We're going to tell you of the fun we had at Johnson's 
Ball; 
Little Sally Horner and I 
were there, you bet. 
Now Sally is the gal for me, she is my little pet; 
The banjo and de fiddle with music was a-ringin', 
Old Jim Bohee and Chloe Bell was a-singin', 
And all the colored folks from the State of Mississipp 
Was present at do ball, doing Hezekiah Flip. 
In singing and dancing we delight, (

Oh, we danced and pranced, the darkeys all did sing, 
Old Peter Snowey made his fiddle ring, 
Little Sal and I, we danced de Highland fling, 
And Pompey and Chloe cut de pigeon wing; 
Then the fun commenced when we began to eat; 
We had ice-cream and honey, oh golly, aint we sweet? 
And id Pete Hooper, we thought he'd never quit, 
He eat so much, and drank so much, he went into a 
fit.

ONE OF THE FINEST. 
Written, Composed and Sang by Gus W ILLIAMS.

field Street, Boston, Mass. 
Copyright, 1'852, by Gus Wir.uax.s. 
Oh, yes, I 
am one of the finest, 
The finest Police ever known; 
In uniform brilliantly shining, 
As proud as a 
king on his throne; 
The ladies all call me their darling, 
As I 
escort them safe o'er Broadway: 
While strolling my beat through the gay, busy street, 
The people admiringly say— 
CIT.
ORITS . 
He's one of the finest, one of the finest, 
Guarding our safety and peace; 
Brave and courageous, never outrageous, 
One of the finest Police. 
The flies never plague me in summer, 
Because they are too much afraid, 
I 
use my club like a 
base drummer, 
That leads a 
big torchlight parade; 
My fana'ly is very domestic, 
I'm sure that they never go out, 
When I 
come to eat, after roaming my beat, 
My wife she is sure for to shout— 
He's one of the finest, 
When eall'd on I'm always found ready, 
I'm in for protection and peace, 
Though some, I'll admit, are not steady, 
But I'm not that kind of Police ; 
I 
flirt with the girls when off duty, 
Gallivanting with them I 
don't shun, 
So gentle I 
am, as a 
little pet lamb, 
And this is the title I've won— 
He's one of the finest, etc. 
THE HASH FIEND. 
BANJO SOLO. 
Composed by ED. C. 
Surrn, of SMITH and LEOPOLD, the Musioal 
Monarchs. 
THERE'S a 
dizzy lives in this town, 
He's awfully " fond of hash 
He's called the worst beat in the West, 
And he's always on the mash. 
He has hash for breakfast, hash for dinner, 
And warmed up hash for tea ; 
Oh, says he, how I 
wish I 
had a 
house made of hash, 
How happy I 
would be. 
cnoims. 
He's very fond of hash. and he never has any cash, 
And in a 
terrible manner could carry the banner, 
But has no desire to see Doctor Tanner; 
He never could get enough, and he thought it was 
awful tough, 
That no one in the city would on him take pity, 
And give him a 
good free lunch. 
This fellow would stand for hours and hours 
In the windows of a 
hashery ; 
He was the most dog-gon-dest crank for hash 
That ever you did see. 
His mammy said when he was young, 
He'd never cat cake or trash, 
But was sure to wake up in the middle of the night, 
Crying, " mamma, I 
want my hash." 
He's very fond of hash, etc. 
Oh ! this hash destroyer is now content ; 
He's got a 
red hot job, 
He's head hash slinger in a 
dizzy eating house, 
He is, so help me Bob. 
Where his soprano piccolo voice is heard, 
While he's raking in the cash, 
A-yelling out at the top of his voice, 
Wjth his mouth chuck full of hash. 
He's very fond of bash, etc. 
IT'S MONEY, AFTER ALL. 
Sung by TONI IVAIIFIELD. 
THERE are men of all professions whom we meet with every day, 
Let our lives be spent in business or in pleasure, as they may, 
Who profess a 
creed in public which they practice not at all; 
For they all are after money ; so ' tis money, after all. 
The doctor, in his office, sits among his drugs and pills, 
And deals his poison doses out to cure the people's ills ; 
He says he loves. 
to give relief to suffering ones who call, 
But he loves to get their money ; so ' tis money, after all. 
The lawyer hangs his shingle out, and asks the public in, 
He promises to right their wrongs, their cases all to win ; 
He says he labors for the good of people, one and all, 
But he charges forty prices ; so ' tis money, after all. 
The office- seeker raves about reform, from morn till night, 
And says if he'll elected be, he'll legislate for right ; 
But when he gets to Congress, he's the grandest rogue of all, 
And he gobbles up our money; so ' tis money, after all. 
Thus in one common class they're grouped, as by my song you 
see, 
No matter what creed they profess, or what their stations be; 
The merchants, doctors, preachers, lawyers, congressmen and 
all, 
They all are after money ; so 
money, after all.

I 
took my love to see the play, 
As other fellahs do. 
And thought that she'd enjoy herself, 
She cried the whole night through. 
And when we reach'd the street again, 
Some oysters I 
proposed„ 
But she said, " No, not me, young man!" 
Still turning up her nose. 
SPolIEN;--Up it went again at three dozen of the best Dutch 
natives, just think of that. 
To see a 
girl turn up her nose at 
twopence a 
time, I 
said, well, my love, if you won't have any 
supper, we will have a 
Cab and go home. 
She replied, "

Not me, when I'm in Greenwich Park, 
I

wanted to take her for a 
nice quiet lover's walk in 
some shady lane, but size said, "she'd prefer a

Then I

So I 
at once proposed; 
But when I 
mentioned the amount, 
Up went her lovely nose.

DAN MULLIGAN'S MASQUERADE. 
W ords and music by THOMAS E. 
POWERS.

Row, New York. 
Price 40 cents. 
Copyright, 1880, by B. 
W . 
HITCHCOCK. 
OH 
! Dan Mulligan is a 
man 
Of great fame and remtwn, 
His name it is a 
househeld world 
In the country and town ; 
At his breakfast last Tuesday morn 
To his fond wife he said, 
"Cordelia dear, next Monday night 
We'll have a 
masquerade. 
CHORUS. 
Faix, he ripp'd up the carpet, 
Took chromos on' the wall, 
And greas'd the floor with tallow, 
Piled the beds in the ball ; 
He order'd pots of chowder, 
Washtubs of lemonade, 
Invited all the neighbors 
To 'tend the masquerade. 
At nine o'clock Dan rung a 
bell, 
They all lept in the room, 
With black masks on their pale faces, 
On their shoulders a 
broom ; 
With sweet Cordelia on- his arm 
Dan led the promenade ; 
'Twas then the fun began oh, oh, 
At Dan Mulligan's masquerade. 
Now Dan wore his short leg trousers 
And slippers on his feet, 
Cordelia in her snow white robes, 
Begorra, she look'd neat, 
And the blackbird Mrs. Allup, 
Dress'd as the Queen of May, 
Recited poor " Shamus O'Brien," 
WLE!-= tale guests did hooray. 
23 
DAN MULLIGAN'S MASQUERADE.—Concluded. 
CHORUS. 
Faix, Lemmong as a 
leapfrog 
Jump'd in the chowder pot, 
Dan pulled him out by the hair, 
And laid him on a 
cot; 
With a 
clothes-line they tied him 
On the tailor's humpback, 
And as he ran round the room 
All hands hit him a 
whack. 
Tommy Fagin, in skin-tight pants, 
Danced the Society 
With big, fat Mrs. Lochmuller, 
How nice they dipp'd their knee ; 
The great Walsingha,m McSweeney, 
Beside the keg he stayed, 
Singing Tom Moore's sweet melodies 
At Dan Mulligan's masquerade. 
At two o'clock they had supper 
In the back yard below; 
Rebecca pass'd the grub around, 
All hands " 
in," you know, 
And all at once they heard music 
Down in the alleyway; 
'Twas the " Full Moons" in full dress came, 
Their compliments to pay. 
CHORUS. 
Faix, Mulligan receiv'd them 
With a 
shower of red bricks ; 
The nagurs drew their razors, 
The lads fought with hay-sticks 
Mrs. Dublin scaled the fence, 
But a 
nail caught in her dress ; 
There she hung calling for help, 
A 
widdy in distress. 
Captain Primrose on a 
shutter 
Was carried home to die, 
Dan Mulligan in a 
handcart 
Bid Cordelia, good-bye; 
Some had lame legs, others black eyes, 
Troth, all hands dearly paid 
For all the pleasure that they had 
At Dan Mr:lligan's masque-
yrade.

OPHELIA MURPHY'S BIRTHMARK. 
By M. S. BLACELOCK. 
The music of this Song is published by E. II. 
H ARING, 229 Bowery,. 
New 
York. 
Price 10 cents. 
Mr friends, I 
have nearly gone crazy, 
I'm flatter than Brannigan's beer, 
All through a 
deceitful young daisy 
That lately walked off " on her ear." 
I'm shovelling smoke at the gas house, 
And board up in Avenue A, 
And there met Ophelia Murphy, 
A 
girl that lived over the way. 
CHORUS. 
She's the one only daughter of 'Paddy Murphee, 
Who was born in the town of Killbeg; 
She has curls red as carrots, a 
beak like a 
parrot's, 
And a 
strawberry mark on her leg. 
We went to each place of divarsion, 
To pic-nics, to weddings and wakes, 
And every night in the summer 
I'd treat her to ice-cream and cakes; 
And when we'd return from our rambles, 
And find the old fogies in bed, 
We'd sit on the stoop there a-singing, 
" 
Swim out, for you're over your head." 
She's the only daughter, etc. 
At last came a 
cruel disaster, 
We went off one night very gay, 
To see the great Tony Booth Pastor 
As Bunthorne in Soolivan's play. 
Ophelia's eyes, how they sparkled, 
You'd think she was 
crank'd" I'll engage, 
When an actor with hair like a 
woman's 
Came swaggering out on the stage. 
She's the one only daughter, etc. 
From that, sure, she raved of theatres, 
I 
think I 
got what I 
desarved, 
Each dollar I 
had in the bank, boys, 
Was spent on the seats called resarved 
In telling the rest of my story 
I 
feel like the softest of loons; 
Last week she ran off with 
A " supe" in the Patience Dragoons. 
CHORUS. 
When she went she left word that she'd joined the " Balee," 
But I 
fear she's turned out a 
bad egg. 
If it's crazy I'm going, my trouble's all owing 
To that strawberry mark on the leg.

W HAT you gwine to do when de great day comes,

All de little children will be char dat day,

Dar's no use waiting till to-morrow, 
De sun will never set on the sorrow.

We'll send him up higher and higher.

come down de street, 
It reminds me of a 
colored band 
That used to play so sweet; 
Every member was a 
coon, 
And popular airs they played; 
You ought to hear de music, 
At a 
dance, or on parade. 
Turn, tum, turn, the cornet went, 
Played by Jimmie Riddle. 
Zume, zume, ume, de old trombone, 
Johnson played de fiddle. 
Tute, tute, tute, the clarinet, 
Played by Jones' wife. 
Music on de fife. 
When de band begins to play, 
Then the people march away; 
Hear the foolish wenches say, 
Watch them coons, give them room, 
Dey ain't got long to stay. 
Jones' wife am tall and black, 
And seven feet she stands; 
She wants to be the leader 
Of that awful colored band. 
Shw plays the drum and cymbals, 
Most beautiful to see ; 
Her eyes are red, and the wig on her head 
Was built in " forty-three." 
Tum, turn, turn, etc. 
THE COLORED BAND.— Concluded. 
One evening in de summer, 
They went out to serenade; 
They 'roused de folks for miles around 
With the discords that they made. 
The police came to stop de row, 
They thought there was a 
fight. 
That colored band marched baud in hand 
To the station-house that night. 
Turn, turn, turn, etc,

SENSATIONS scarcely pass away, 
When new ones are at hand; 
The latest is imported now 
From France to Yankee land ; 
With serenades and banquets, too, 
Receptions every day; 
A 
fortune we must own indeed 
To see Miss Sarah play. 
HAVE YOU SEEN SARAII ?—Concluded. 
Co, 25 
Upon my knees I 
spoke of l
ove 
And all my railroad shares; 
She raised her foot to my coat-tails 
And flung me down the stairs. 
Have you seen Sarah, etc. 
CHORUS. 
Have you seen Sarah ? ain't she a 
tearer ? 
None could be fairer than Miss Sarah B.; 
Froggies and poodles, claret and noodles, 
And a 
lot of Fitzfoodles ! oh ! parley vous ! Oui! 
Have you seen Sarah ? ain't she a 
tearer ? 
None could be fairer than Miss-Sarah B.; 
Froggies and poodles, claret and noodles, 
And a 
lot of Fitzfoodles ! Oh! parley vous! Oui! 
One evening at the Albemarle 
I 
sought an interview; 
I 
saw her in the corridor, 
And to her side I 
flew; 
Her picture gallery is immense, 
At least so I 
have heard ; 
A " peck " she eats at every gulp, 
Just like a 
little bird. 
A 
sculptor too she claims to be, 
But tell yqu this I 
must— 
When chisling out a 
marble head 
She's always on a 
bust. 
Have you seen Sarah, etc. 
She's many chromos, rich and rare, 
That she'll expose to you ; 
'Twill cost you forty dollars to 
Obtain a 
single view. 
In fact, she is so awful thin, 
Before she leaves us yet, 
We'll use her for a 
piece of reed, 
On a 
yellow clarinet.

A 
BANJO SOLO. 
On, I 
will sing to you of a 
red-headed gal, 
They call her Dry Dock Sal ; 
She sold mutton pies on a 
big tin pan, 
And her lover was a 
gay young sailor man, 
Oh, her lover was a 
harpoon man. 
And her lover was a 
sailor laddie, 
And his American name was Paddie; 
Oh, be was chief harpooner on a 
big whale ship, 
That sailed once a 
year from the foot of Peck Slip, 
Oh, her lover was a 
harpoon man. 
But now she's vamoosed the ranch, 
For she has gone down to Long Branch ; 
For she sits in the light house all day long, 
Looking through a 
clam shell singing this song, 
Oh, my love was a 
sailor man. 
THE YOUNG GAL FROM NEW JERSEY. 
On, in eighteen sixty, I 
used to go to sea,

And buy a

Oh, this young gal from New Jersey who kept company with me. 
This young gal, etc. 
Oh, her mother took in washing, and her father he sawed wood, 
And her sisters and her brothers white washing understood ; 
But now we are to be married, and a

With this young gal from New Jersey who kept company with me.

We used to work for massa, 
In the State of Arkansaw; 
But when the war was over, 
And we darkies were set free, 
We packed our collar boxes, 
This wide world for to see. 
Gloriation goodness, 
We travel on together, 
Without a

We never have a

To mar our happy life, 
We've worked so long together

I 
LOVE a 
fellow nice and sweet, 
A 
beautiful brunette, 
He is not swellish, but he's just 
A 
darling, you can bet; you bet ; 
His form is beautiful and straight, 
He has a 
manly air, 
And then he has a 
lovely head 
Of black and curly hair. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, he is just a 
darling duck, 
My Charlie, sweet and fair; 
The dearest thing in life to me 
Is Charlie's curly hair. 
He has a 
dark and piercing eye, 
A 
killing black mustache, 
And when he promenades the street 
He cuts a " nobby " dash ; you bet; 
The girls they all are after him, 
For them he does not care, 
Altho' they often compliment 
His black and curly hair. 
Oh, he is, etc. 
Together we go out to ride 
Behind a 
trotter fast, 
You ought to see us on the road, 
We never are the last ;. you bet ; 
We " shoot " past all the single teams, 
Oft beat a " fancy pair," 
And all the time I'm thinking of 
My Charlie's curly hair. 
Oh, he is, etc: 
He calls to see me twice a 
week, 
And brings nice things to eat. 
Which he takes from the pockets of 
His clothes made up so neat; you bet; 
And when he bids me sweet " good night,* 
He whispers of an heir 
That we may have in future years, 
With black and curly hair. 
Oh, he is, etc. 
YELLOW PURP. 
BANJO SOLO. 
Written and Sung by Tom WARFEELD. 
COME all young girls, and old ones too, 
And listen to my ditty, 
And when you've heard this doleful tale, 
I'm sure you'll have some pity. 
It's about a 
yellow canine purp, 
So old he couldn't see, 
He lost his teeth in chewing beef, 
With the army in ' 63. 
My mother-in-law, she thought so much 
Of this knock-kneed old kyoodle, 
She'd take him on her lap, and feed him on pap, 
And she'd sing him Yankee Doodle. 
One day the old lady flew into a 
rage, 
A 
circular saw she drew ; 
The dog was up to snuff', you bet he saw enough, 
And he skipped the tra-la-loo. 
My mother-in-law made friends with the dog, 
They sat down side-by-side ; 
She told him funny stories, and fed him up with prog, 
And he laughed until he cried ; 
Her tongue kept going like a 
Steam engine, 
Until she was out of breath ; 
The dog stood on his head, and his breath leaked out ; 
She had talked the poor animule to death. 
DON'T YOU TELL MY FATHER.

The Dry Goods Clerk's Dream. 
Written and sung by SAM DEVERE. 
Calico Ike was a 
nice young man, 
He was clerk in a 
dry goods store; 
His hair was blue and his eyes were red, 
All the girls did him adore. 
One night he imbibed too much hair tonic 
With a 
friend out late it seems; 
And they both went home and iell in bed, 
To wander in the land of dreams. 
Ike dreamt that linens and calicoes 
Were piled up mountains high, 
And rich old dames with daughters fair, 
Were walking in to buy. 
He dreamt that bustles flew in the air, 
That whiskey ran in a 
stream; 
The ' skeeters and bed-bugs bad a 
picnic, 
While this dry goods clerk did dream. 
Ike dreamt of one young fairy form, 
Who cut a 
gorgeous shine, 
That walked into his dry goods store, 
For muslin, superfine. 
He dreamt he was tearing off seven yards, 
Then something went ker smack, 
His friend jumped up with his night shirt torn 
Ker flip right up the back.

GOOD-BYE, LOVELY LOU. 
Written awl sung by Gus W ILLIAMS, the greatest of all vocalists, 
with tremendous- success. 
Copyright, 1879, by Louis P. GOULLATID. 
'TWAS early in the month of May, 
I 
said to my girl Lou, 
As I 
am going far away, 
I'm going to ask if you 
Will constant be while I'm at sea ? 
She bowed her lovely head, 
Then placed her tiny hands in mine, 
And I 
to her then said— 
CHORUS. 
Good-bye, good-bye, good-bye, lovely Lou, 
Think of me when I'm at sea, and I 
will think of you. 
Good-bye, good-bye, good-bye, lovely Lou, 
Think of me "when I'm at sea, and I 
will think of you. 
She said, to you I 
will be true, 
To do the same I 
ought; 
Tho' I 
am told you sailors 
Have a 
wife in every port. 
I 
said, " Now, Lou, don't look so blue, 
Or think me so unkind, 
I 
never could forget 
The girl I 
left behind." 
Good-bye, eta. 
I've one thing, Lou, to tell to you, 
Before the seas I 
roam, 
And that is of the presents 
I'm going to bring you home. 
An Indian shawl, a 
parasol, 
A 
tiny kangaroo; 
A monkey and a 
parrot, yes, 
And they are all for you. 
Good-bye, et) 
I 
bid adieu to lovely Lou, 
We parted on the shore. 
And something seemed to tell me 
I 
should never see her more. 
When I 
returned I 
quickly learned 
That she had gone away; 
So now as Lou has proved untrue, 
Why, I 
can only say— 
Good-by,

HIS NAME WASN'T LARGE ON THE BILLS. 
Written by W M. B. 
CAVANAGH. 
Sung by BILLY CARTER. 
Bill Cotton a 
vocalist young and ambitious, 
'Whose muse was decidedly good and propitious, 
He shili'd for high honors and tuned his banjo. 
And nightly drew plaudits from the gods at the show% 
The fair sex admired hint, he made conquests a 
score. 
The artists, too, laughed at his puns o'er and o'er, 
But sad his misfortune and bitterest of pills, 
His name wasn't large on the regular bills. 
CHORUS. 
The ballet girls adored him and stood in the wings, 
While he tuned his banjo and said funny things; 
But sad his misfortune and bitterest of pills, 
His name wasn't large on the regular bills. 
His fame kept increlsing throughout all the land, 
And scores of new friends he shook by the hand, 
The dailies too praised him in articles long, 
For Ids manipulations of banjo and song. 
Then resolving to be in the profession a 
beau, 
lie called on a 
tailor for a 
suit comme-il faut, 
But the snip would not trust him or measure his limbs, 
For his name wasn't large on the regular bills. 
The ballet girls, Sze. 
He left his cheap lodgings, to a 
hotel did go, 
Detertnined to cut all acquaintances low, 
For to mix in high circles the elite of his elan. 
Was the principal hobby 01 this soaring young man. 
But the landlord being present gave him n 
a 
sly glance, 
And politely demanded his board in advance, 
Get a 
line from time 
u 
e 
manager to secure s 
from ills, 
For your name isn't large on Ihe r r 
bills. 
The ballet girls, &c. 
A bewitching- brunette did his senses entrance, 
Eis heart was a 
slave to her enraptured glance, 
He proposed, was refused, so to end all his woe, 
Packed his things up at night, bade adieu to the show. 
And now o'er the sea in far distant climes, 
He wanders on foot plays his banjo and rhymes, 
For his country or home his heart never thrills, 
For his name wasn't large on the regular bills.

OWEN REILLY. 
sung with immense success by liAnny KERN-ELL. 
OH, my name is Owen Reilly, 
I 
have a 
son that's got me crazy; 
He is out every night singing comic songs 
He learns at some free and easy ; 
He wanted his mother to put on the gloves with him, 
He broke his little brother's leg with a 
poker ; 
He has an old pack of cards he carries in his pocket, 
And he wants me to play Sanco Pedro and the Joker; 
He kicked his sister Honora in the forehead last week. 
He bate the eldest boy of cross-eyed McCarty; 
He goes prancing around to the Sunday eve balls, 
And he has a:girl on the stage at the Varieties. 
He pawned my Sunday clothes last week 
To go and lay a 
wager; 
He brought me down town in the middle of the night 
To fight with a 
big black nager. 
There's his cousin Mike is a 
fine young man, 
With the nicest kind of manners ; 
Night after night they go walking around, 
And they call it carrying the banners; 
But the two of them got in a 
scrape, 
They stole a 
Dutchman's pony ; 
Poor Mike is in the workhouse now 
And Bernard's in California. 
He tied a 
tin can on our dog's tail 
When we went to church last Sunday; 
He got stiff broiling tight, stayed out all night, 
And was up before the Court House on Monday; 
He is got the house all turned inside out, 
He has gone to the bad entirely; 
Some fine day I 
fear he will be hung, 
Lord help you, Bernard Reilly; 
He says he is taking lessons from Professor John Dwyer; 
He wants pie and sponge cake for his supper, 
He comes home every night full of gin, 
And he throws the corn beef and cabbage in the gutter.

THE ANIMALS' 
JUBILEE, 
Sung by Joux FORBES. 
THE tom cat went out on a 
spree, 
Met his friend the bumblebee; 
The bumblebee stung him on the back, 
And the old tom cat, he made tracks. 
A 
monkey sat on Bunker Hill, 
Gave the woodchuck a 
sugar pill ; 
That sugar pill it was so strong, 
It killed a 
snake 'bout four miles long. 
CHORUS. 
The Bengal tiger and the big bulldog, 
They got drunk on good egg-nog; 
The bulldog got so awful drunk, 
He went to sleep in the elephant's trunk. 
The mosquito said unto the flea, 
" 
Shoo-fly I 
don't you pester me ;" 
And the bed-bug came along that way, 
Says, " How are you off for stamps to-day ?" 
The rat and mouse, they had a 
spree, 
The grasshopper with them took tea ; 
The rat told the mouse he was a 
bloat, 
The cat came along and ate them both. 
The shanghai rooster on a 
bender 
Crowed till he busted his suspender; 
He busted his mouth from ear to ear, 
Drinking a 
glass of lager beer. 
CHORUS. 
Hokey poker 71,:tey warn, 
How do you like your taters done ? 
Dipped in 'lasses, washed in rum, 
Lots of gin in the buzard.'s roc's*,

IT DON'T BELONG TO ME. 
sang with great success by H ARRY M ONTAGUI. 
You see I 
am so very good, I 
never claim a 
thing 
That don't belong to me, you know, for that would be a 
sin ; 
I 
assure you I 
am honest and as truthful as can be, 
And I 
wouldn't think of picking up what don't belong to 
me. 
While walking down the street one day, by a 
policeman 
I 
was stopped, 
Who said, " I 
think this purse, young man, from your 
coat pocket dropped ;" 
Now, as I 
never carry one, I've so little cash, you see, 
Like an honest man, I 
said at once, " It don't belong to 
me." 
It don't belong to me, it don't -belong to me, 
You'd better inquire of somebody else, it don't belong 
t--) 
me; 
I 
never saw the purse before, it can't be mine you see, 
I 
know nothing whatever about it, it don't belong to 
me. 
My wages being very small, I 
live in quiet style, 
But with the girls I 
lah-de-dah, and the agony I 
pile;

IT DON'T BELONG TO ME.—Concluded. 
I 
tell them almost anything, for I've got lots of cheek, 
They little think I

One day I 
bought a 
waffle, which I 
popped inside my hat, 
For I 
saw a 
lady coming along, and I 
knew she'd stop and 
chat 
My hat blew off, the waffle fell out, the street boys 
laughed with glee, 
But when they brought it back I 
said, " It don't belong 
to me." 
I 
never saw that waffle before, etc. 
I 
occupied a 
front room in a 
house not far up town, 
And in the back room lived a 
girl, whose name was Jenny 
Brown, 
Whene'er I'd chance to meet her, well, I'd pass the time 
of day, 
And have a 
little talk with her, in a 
friendly sort of way. 
The other night when I 
got home, oh what a 
dreadful 
scene, 
And my landlady asked of me, " Now, what does all this 
mean ? 
" 
Miss Brown has gone, but left behind this bundle, as 
you see." 
Said I, " -You quite surprise me, but it don't belong to 
me." 
I 
never saw the bundle before, etc.

Ox, would I 
were a 
bird, 
I'd rather be a 
bear, 
And in a 
big menagerie, 
For folks at me to stare ; 
I'd dance on my hind feet, 
Then asleep appear to be, 
And when they'd tickle me, 
I'd growl in the key of G. 
Oh, would I 
were a 
fish, 
I'd rather be a 
swallow, 
I'd fly so fast along the shore, 
I'd beat the lightning hollow ; 
And when the boys would come with gun; 
To shoot me on the wing ; 
I'd wink at them with my off eye 
And " Shoo Fly " I 
would sing. 
Oh, would I 
were a 
giant, 
I'd act upon the stage ; 
In tragedy I'd play Hamlet, 
For you know it's all the rage; 
In dress like an Indian Tobacco sign, 
With moccasins number sixteen ; 
To froth at the mouth I'd chew brown soap, 
And eat up all the scenes. 
Oh, would I 
were a 
cat, 
I'd rather be a 
don-, 
A 
little two ounce black and tan, 
As frisky as a 
frog ; 
But best of all I'd rather be, 
The one to please you all ; 
And hoping I 
have done so now, 
Good-night, till again 
call.

SICKING A MAN WHEN HE'S DOWN.

SKELLY.

York. Price 10 cents.

W HEN the sun of prosperity's shining, 
And man's growing richer each day, 
When in ease and in comfort reclining, 
And golden success crowns his way, 
flow friends then will gather around him! 
But if fortune should happen to frown, 
He finds that his former " good fellows " 
Will kick him as soon as he's down. 
CHORUS. 
When poor and astray a 
man's in the way, 
He meets all around him a 
frown ; 
Then reckless and sad, he " goes to the bad," 
Because he is kick'd when he's down. 
How kindly the world smiles upon him 
When life with successes abounds ; 
How blandly each neighbor will greet him 
As in pleasure he's riding around ; 
But then let reverse overtake him, 
And his friends, both in country and town, 
Have not a 
kind sentence to cheer him. 
But will kick him as soon as he's down. 
When poor and astray, etc. 
Let a 
man get position and riches— 
No matter by right or by fraud— 
The world nods approvingly on him, 
And loudly his creatures applaud ; 
But just let bini lose all his treasures, 
Tho' before he was full of renown, 
The people find out he has fallen, 
And then let him die when ne's down. 
When poor and astray, etc. 
0, why is all mankind so selfish'? 
We know it should never he thus ; 
Then why can't we do to our neighbors 
As we would have them do to us'? 
And if in " adversity's ocean " 
We are sinking And ready to drown, 
Twice blest is the friend whose devotion 
Will help a 
man up when he's down. 
When poor and astray, etc. 
GIVE AID TO THE POOR. 
Sung with great success at the New Chicago Theatre, by Cue.m.,Eis 
Dumex. 
I'vE an object in view I 
would like to reveal, 
About a 
poor workingman tempted to steal, 
Whose children at home they were starving for food; 
The poor things were freezing ; there was no coal nor 
wood. 
Alas! be it said sweet charity was dead; 
The friend of the poor to another world had sped. 
This poor workingman he had nothing in store, 
And a 
cry came from heaven, " Give aid to the poor!" 
Alexander T. Stewart, the great New York millionaire, 
Departed this life for another world's care. 
It would not have hurt him I'm certain and sure 
To have left a 
few thousands to help feed the poor. 
He invested, I'm told, in a 
great institute. 
In a 
matter of business " you bet" he was cute. 
He was not like Jim Fisk, nor will be many more, 
With his lightning express giving aid to the poor. 
My object, dear friends, is to ask you to share 
With the poor and the needy wherever you are. 
Remember that poverty is never a 
crime ; 
Good clothes often cover a 
heart filled with slime. 
Don't forget your dear mother wherever you roam, 
Nor the dear darling loved ones she tends well at home. 
Oh! don't let a 
hungry man go past your door, 
ikiad God will reward giving aid to the poor.

THERE'S a 
little girl that charms 
The world as well as me, 
With her eyes of blue, so sweet and true, 
And heart so free. 
Many hours among the flowers, 
Do I 
pass with her, 
Sallie Homer 'round the corner, 
Little one so dear. 
CHORUS. 
Now I 
wonder as I 
ponder, 
If she's true to me, 
If I'm any of the many 
Will she constant be. 
None completer, none is sweeter, 
In this world of ours, 
Sallie, Horner 'round the corner, 
In her home of flowers. 
You'll discover how to love her, 
If you only try, 
You'll be given gleams of heaven 
If you catch her eye. 
Like the stars that gleam and glisten, 
In the azure sky, 
When she speaks the angels listen, 
As they pass her by. 
Now I 
wonder as I 
ponder, etc. 
She is very shy and merry, 
In her roguish ways, 
I 
adore her more and more, 
In all my. love- lit days. 
Always suemg, fondly wooing, 
For her heart divine, 
Sallie Horner 'round the corner, 
Oh ! she must be mine. 
Now I 
wonder as T 
ponder, etc.

THE art of love-making is bard to unfold, 
It's something you can't well explain ; 
Sometimes you are fervent, sometimes you are cold, 
'Tis a 
mixture of pleasure and pain. 
I've lately been caught in that dangerous net 
By a 
creature so charming and fair, 
She has me en chanted, you know how it is, 
I 
guess you have all been there. 
CHORUS. 
I 
guess you have all been there, 
guess you have all been there ; 
You know, I 
MU sure, what lovers endure, 
I 
guess you have all been there. 
I 
take her out walking beneath the bright moon, 
And whisper the old loving tale ; 
The sound of her voice drives away all my gloom, 
We wander by hillside and vale, 
Thro' meadows and groves, like two little doves, 
We ramble it matters not where ; 
I 
can't sleep at night, and its killing me quite, 
I 
guess you have all been there. 
I 
guess you have all been there, etc. 
Her father is wealthy and very high-toned, 
Of his beautiful daughter he's proud ; 
It's already planned that I'll ask for her hand, 
But will my request be allowed ? 
I'm afraid he'll get angry and show inc the door, 
And make my love melt into air ; 
Then what shall I 
do ? now my friends I 
ask you, 
I 
guess you have all been there. 
I 
guess you have all been there, etc. 
I'll keep up my courage and to her be true, 
Although the old gent may oppose ; 
I'll wait at the gate for my sweet little Kate, 
Till time all his hate overthrows ; 
I'll press her soft hand and I'll call her my own, 
While together a 
sweet kiss we share, 
And before I 
go 'way—but what more need I 
say ? 
I 
guess you have all been there. 
I 
guess you have all beer, there, etc.

SOME think that life the most jolly 
Is found in a 
smoky town, 
But give me the glorious country, 
Where one can get healthy and brown. 
I 
like it now better than ever, 
I'll tell you the reason why— 
If you think I'm blind, perhaps I 
am, 
For I've got a 
sweet girl in my eye. 
CHORUS. 
Down, down by the old water mill, 
Close by the side of a 
rippling rill, 
Tit a 
dear little cottage just under the hill, 
There's where I 
met with my darling. 
She showed me the ducks and the drakes, 
She showed me the cocks and the hens, 
She showed me the shovels and rakes, 
And the dear little ba's in their pens. 
She showed me the birds and the bees, 
Likewise the pigs and the sows, 
She showed me the butter and cheese, 
And also the bulls and the cows. 
Down, down, etc. 
The ducks they would waddle to greet her, 
The geese made a 
terrible row, 
The cocks and the hens raced to meet her, 
And merrily grunted the sow. 
She feeds them from out of her apron, 
Her kindness to all never fails, 
Whenever she passes a 
bull or a 
cow, 
They're sure to waggle their tails. 
Down, down, etc,.

BEFORE you now you see the boy 
Who's always full of fun; 
I 
carries my shop upon my back, 
I'm always on the run, 
And all the folks they look at me 
With wonder in their eye, 
And you can tell when I'm about, 
For you can hear me cry— 
SPOKEN.— Black yer boots, shine ' era up 7 
CHORE'S. 
I'm as happy as any one can be, 
The banjo I 
lino-, 
I 
dance and I 
sing; 
It's all the same to me ; 
I'm as happy as any one can be, 
The banjo I 
ring, I 
dance and I 
sing ; 
It's all the same to me. 
I 
serve the rich, also the poor, 
And use them all the same; 
Of course I 
try to do my best, 
To bring them back again. 
You'll always find me gay and free, 
To please of course I'll try, 
And you can tell when I'm about, 
For you can hear me cry— 
SPOKEN.—Black yer boots, shine ' em up 7 
I'm as happy, etr. 
I've got my eye upon a 
girl, 
And to her I'll be true ; 
She keeps a 
little paper stand 
Upon the Avenue. 
When I 
grow up to be a 
man 
To win her then I'll try ; 
With fortune made we'll then retire, 
No more you'll hear me cry— 
Btosim—Black yer boots, shine ' ern up 7 
I'm as happy, etc. 
YOU'VE BEEN DOING SOMETHING 
NAUGHTY. 
OH, when I 
was a 
little boy I 
was on mischief bent, 
And up to every sort of fun, or any devilment; 
And when that I 
had older grown, I'd visit the green 
park, 
And have a 
roll down the green slopes, and play till it 
was dark. 
SPOKEN. — I 
do like a 
roll down the slopes in the park. 
One day I 
met the Simpkinses there, and we had a 
race 
just to see who could roll the fastest, and it was so nice. 
When I 
got home mother said, " What the dickens have 
you been up to, why your elbows are all green ?" 
Then 
between a 
blink and a 
squint she said— 
CHORUS. 
You've been doing something naughty, I 
can tell it by 
your eye; 
You've been doing something naughty, for you look so 
very sly ; 
You've been doing something naughty, since you pull a 
face so long ; 
You've been doing something naughty, you've been doing 
something wrong. 
To Rosherville I 
took Miss Brown, to spend a 
happy day, 
And there we had some jolly fun, which made us feel 
quite gay ; 
We danced upon the platform and listened to the band, 
Than strolled around the garden together hand in hand. 
( ) 
YOU'VE BEEN DOING SOMETHING 
NAUGHTY.—Concluded. 
SPOKEN.—Oh, I 
did enjoy it so much. We walked 
about for some time, and then sat down under some trees 
in a 
retired spot ; then we whispered loving words, and 
it was so nice. 
And just as I 
was about to imprint a 
kiss 
upon her fair cheek, I 
beheld a 
face peeping from behind 
a 
tree. 
It was her father, and this is what he said to 
You've been doing something naughty, etc. 
At length we left the Gardens and journeyed home by 
train, 
I 
pressed her darling little hand and whispered lOw her 
name, 
When some one in our carriage, perhaps thinking it no 
harm, 
While in the tunnel pulled the rope, which caused a 
great 
alarm. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, I 
was just in the act of pressing her 
hand, and it was so nice, when some stupid individual 
pulled the alarm bell, and the train was stopped, and the 
guard came to our carriage window and inquired what 
was the matter ; but the moment he saw me he said, I 
see it all, it's you, sir — 
You've been doing something naughty, etc.

MY BABY. 
As sung by CHARLEY BACKUS at the San Francisco Minstrels' Opera 
House. 
I'M the father of an infant 
Baby mine, baby mine; 
He won't let me rest an instant, 
Baby mine, baby mine; 
He won't do a 
thing he's bid, 
How I 
wish that I 
was rid 
Of that awful sassy kid, 
Baby mine, baby mine, 
Of that awful sassy kid, 
Baby mine. 
At my meals I 
have to hold him, 
Baby mine, baby mine ; 
How I 
Dever dare to scold him, 
Baby mine, baby mine ; 
My face he'll surely scratch, 
And the table-cloth he'll snatch, 
All my crockery goes to smash, 
Baby mine, baby mine. 
All my crockery goes to smash, 
Baby mine. 
He's a 
pimple on his nose, 
Baby mine, baby mine ; 
And we wash him with a 
hose, 
Baby mine, baby mine ; 
You'd ought to hear him roar, 
And I 
have to walk the -floor, 
And I'd like to break his jaw, 
Baby mine, baby mine, 
Yes, I'd like to break his jaw, 
Baby mine. 
In my hair he often lingers, 
Baby mine, baby mine ; 
With molasses on his fingers, 
Baby mine, baby mine ; 
To hear him cry it is a 
sin, 
To quiet him we'll begin, 
Till at last we find a 
pin 
Sticking in baby mine, 
Till at last we find a 
pin, 
Baby mine.

Composed and sung by JOHNNY PATTERSON. 
Music by DAVE BRALIAM. 
Dedicated to ROBERT STICKNEY, Esq. 
Cod all ye lovers, young and old, and listen to my song, 
For I'll relate and truly state the cause of all that's wrong. 
Ere I 
did roam I 
loved at home a 
girl named Molly, Oh! 
Bat now she's gone and left me in a 
state of grief and 
woe. 
onours. 
I'm travelling round the country, and I'm searching high 
and low; 
But she's gone to Cincinnati, in the State of Oho-ho. 
Last week I 
went to Brooklyn to see- some boys from 
Clare. 
I 
saw Michael Ryan, Pat O'Brien, and a 
boy named Mar-
tin Hare. 
They said that Molly went out West, but the place they 
do not know, 
Still they think it's Cincinnati, in the State of Oho-ho. 
CHORUS. 
Your American country is so large, where to go I 
do not 
know 
And look for Cincinnati, or its State of Oho-ho. 
No-w, if I 
don't find my Molly dear, I'll tell you what 
do: 
I'll go to Salt Lake City—'tisn't one I'll have, but two— 
And if ever Molly finds me out, I'll have her for to know 
She may go to Cincinnati, in the State of Oho-ho. 
And if ever Molly finds me out, I'll have her for to know 
She may go to Cincinnati, in the State of Oho-ho.

THE old man ain't himself no mo', he's nearly gone to seed, 
And these hands refuse to do the daily toil ; 
I 
never dream'd ' twould come to this, or that I'd be in 
need, 
After years of service in Carlina 
.71y limbs are bending 'neath their weight, my hair is white 
as snow, 
And I 
cannot see the gentle summer sky ; 
My feet grow weary day by day, my step is weak and slow, 
And I'm gwiue to leave my comrades by and by. 
CHORUS. 
The old man ain't himself no mo', lie's nearly gone to 
seed, 
And his hands refuse to do the daily toil. 
The old man ain't himself no mo', he's nearly gone to

And his hands refuse to do the daily toil. 
The good old days when I 
was young have flitted like a 
dream, 
And I 
hardly knew that I 
was growing old ; 
I 
never stopped to think how these poor arms of mine 
would seem, 
If the poor old man was left out in the cold. 
But now I 
know the feeling well, it almost breaks my heart 
For to think that I 
must die away from home. 
Oh, if I 
could be young again, to-morrow I 
would start, 
And to old Cartna's shores I'd quickly main. 
The old man ain't himself, etc. 
I 
long to see the cotton fields, the tall Palmetto trees, 
And. to hear the happy darkeys shout and sing ; 
I 
never shall forget the good, the old pkintation glees, 
Or the way we used to make the banjo ring ; 
But all is nearly over now, the trumpet soon will sound, 
Then I'll have to cross the river over there ; 
And when I 
set my aching feet upon the sacred gromtd, 
I 
shall know DO MO ' 
about this wordly care. 
The old man ain't himself, etc.

The chaff about the Girls, of This 
Fast period, is past, 
In fact I 
thought the fun was 
Getting much too thick to last ! 
But now you'll find the subject changed 
If you the papers scan, 
Instead of taking off the Girls, 
They chaff our " Fast young 
CnoNais.—The young men of the present day 
They go the pace—yes rather. 
But who the piper has to pay, 
You'd better ast: Tom's father. 
They visit Music halls, of course, 
Casinos, balls as well, 
Wear patent leather boots, and tights, 
And come the heavy swell. 
In strong cigars of course indulge. 
At pool and billiards play, 
And drink like little fishes, 
Can these " Young Men of the day." 
The young men, dica. 
They stay indoors when they have drained 
Their pockets to the dregs, 
Beneath their Dad's " mahogany " 
Then often " kick their legs," 
They never take their sisters out 
It's such a 
bore they vow, 
Oue really cannot tell to what 
Young- men are coming now. 
The young men, tke. 
Sometimes they do " the opera," 
And come out rather grand, 
Of course an Omnibus is slow, 
A cab call from the stand; 
Young ladies are discarded, 
For they're too much trouble, they sat-, 
And marriage ne'er is thought of 
By the 
Young Men of the day." 
The young men, dte. 
But when a 
fellow's youne-, why 
He's of course on pleasure bent., 
And thoite-li he may he rather gay, 
No liar: ii is really meant. 
Young folks must sow their wild oats, 
Or at least as people cay, 
And we'll hope for reformation, 
In our " Yuung Men of the (The young men, dm

NAPOLEON'S ORACITLUM, 
OR, 
BOOK OF FATE. 
The only Complete American, from the Fiftieth 
London Edition. 
This is the oldest, and for that very reason the best of Fortune Tellers. 
It was compiltd in the remote ages, when learned men consulted the stars, 
and watched .)uid interpreted the decrees of fate, and inquired into and 
often mastered the mysteries of what we vaguely term Chance. 
Certain it 
is, that Bonaparte obtained a 
copy of this book, written upon papyrus. 
He 
curiously consults it. 
From that time a 
gloom overspread his massive brow. 
Did it dimly reveal to him Moscow, Waterloo, St. Helena ? We only know 
it was found in his carriage after his last great fight. 
Tens of thousands 
consult this Graculum with daily increasing faith, in its truthful answeriugs. 
Price. 10 cents.
