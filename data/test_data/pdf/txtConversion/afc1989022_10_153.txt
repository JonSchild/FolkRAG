ACKNOWLEDGMENTS 
would like to thank everyone who knowingly and 
unknowingly, directly and indirectly, paved the path which led 
to this study. First, my parents, Paul and Rose Manini, who 
valued education, urged me to go to college and supported me 
as much as possible. I 
owe a 
great deal to my aunts Mary 
Caporale, Sandy Muraca, Katie Lisi and Angela Romero, 
whose religious devotion and home altars fascinated me and 
sparked my interest in folk religion. My father, his sister Angie 
Romero and her daughter Veronica nurtured my interest in Italy 
and all things Italian. Along with my cousins Phyllis Ann 
Caporale and Phyllis Lisi, these people also encouraged my 
educational pursuits. 
Several teachers also deserve thanks. Mr. Gehring, 
Miss Flynn and Mr. Duquette made learning fun in the public 
schools in Dalton, Massachusetts. Dorothy Kaschube, Alan 
Taylor, Esther Zago and Paul Shankman encouraged me at the 
University of Colorado at Boulder (CU). Also at CU, Giovanna 
Jackson and Mike Bell deserve recognition for the introduction 
they gave me to the field of folklore. 
And special thanks to my good friend and teacher Julia 
Amari, professor emerita of Italian at CU, who has given me 
v 
k 
r 
special attention, the special attention she gives to every 
student, since 1978. Julia also kindly read and edited this 
report for me, and her comments led to this revised edition. 
The supervisor of this report, Jose Limon helped me 
develop a 
focus for my research, brought me back to reality 
when I 
was lost in a 
cloud of graduate student anxiety, and put 
up with my procrastination. I 
am very grateful for his useful 
comments and insights. I 
would also like to thank Doug Foley 
for his critique and approval of the report. 
It was an honor to study with Americo Paredes at The 
University of Texas at Austin (UT), and receive my introduction 
to Mexican American folklore from such an illustrious and kind 
man. I 
would also like to thank anthropology faculty members 
Joel Sherzer, Steve Feld and Brian Stross for their support 
during the semesters I 
spent at UT. 
Many, many, many thanks go to friends and Texas 
folklorists Suzanne Seriff and Kay Turner. They encouraged 
me to pursue the Saint Joseph's table as a 
topic for this report, 
and their knowledge about the tradition was a 
valuable 
resource for my study. I 
would also like to thank Suzy for 
reading the first draft of this report and offering several very 
useful suggestions, and Deborah Espinosa, director of the El

ABSTRACT 
"Saint Joseph Isn't Just for Italians:" 
A 
Hispanic Recreation of a 
Sicilian Home Altar Tradition 
by 
Paula Marie Manini, M.A. 
The University of Texas at Austin, 1994 
SUPERVISOR: Jose E. Limon 
This is an examination of a 
Hispanic adoption of a 
Sicilian home altar tradition, called the Saint Joseph's table, 
which takes place in Pueblo, Colorado. In the essay, I 
situate 
the adopted version of this Catholic folk tradition in its cultural, 
social and economic contexts. I 
describe Saint Joseph's tables 
given by various ethnic altar makers, with an emphasis on a 
Hispanic parish which has had a 
Saint Joseph's table every 
147/ 
year since 4.975. 1 
examine issues of religion, economics and 
ethnicity and how these topics emerge symbolically and 
verbally in the Hispanic performance of the Sicilian tradition.

INTRODUCTION 
In Roman Catholicism, Saint Joseph is foster father of 
Jesus, husband to Mary, the patron of the family, the home, 
the poor, charity, workers and the Universal Church 1. He is 
also the patron of the Italian island of Sicily, where a 
tradition 
called the Saint Joseph's table, or altar, has existed for 
centuries. 2 In mementos distributed at these special tables, 
Sicilian Americans in Pueblo, Colorado, say the ancient ritual 
began when famine plagued the island. To end the starvation 
and suffering, the peasants prayed to Joseph. When he 
answered their prayers, they thanked him with altars of food, 
their most prized possession. In Pueblo, the tradition evolved 
into immense open houses, featuring an elaborate altar laden 
with a 
great quantity of food, held on March 19, the Feast Day 
of Saint Joseph on the Catholic calendar. 
1 Joseph is also patron of fathers, virgins, widows, peace, 
social justice, orphans, unwed mothers, carpenters and 
craftsmen, pastry cooks, and of a 
happy death (because he 
died in the presence of Jesus and Mary). According to 
Speroni, Joseph's association with the poor, widows and 
orphans is attributed to words of Jesus in the apocryphal 
History of Joseph the Carpenter (1940:135, note 2). 
2 For historical information on the Saint Joseph's table 
tradition see Giuseppe Pitre (1878-1913) and G. Tamburello 
(1897).

1. 
Many tradition bearers in Pueblo have ancestors who 
brought the ritual with them when they emigrated from Lucca 
Sicula, a 
town in southwestern Sicily. Sicilian Puebloans 
continue the tradition as the primary altar makers, donors and 
visitors to table events. They do, however, invite others to 
their patronal observances through personal invitations, 
memos to coworkers, and announcements in church bulletins 
and newspapers. Some altar givers offer a 
special invitation to 
other ethnic groups. Souvenir fliers often distributed at tables 
say, "Since Saint Joseph is the patron of the Universal Church 
and devotion to him is widespread, parishes of ethnic origins 
may wish to observe or adopt this practice." 
Indeed, Puebloans with roots in the Italian states of 
Calabria3, 
Campagna and Piemonte, in Eastern Europe and 
the Hispanic Southwest have adopted the ritual. Adopted 
versions take place in private homes or at parish halls. For 
several years, tables in Pueblo have been organized as annual 
events at two Catholic parishes. In 1991, 1993 and 1994, 
3 There is a 
similar tradition in some parts of the southern 
Italian regions of Apulia, Basilicata, Abruzzo and Calabria. 
Calabrain Puebloans who I 
met, however, had learned the 
ritual from Sicilian neighbors. The Feast Day of Saint Joseph is 
observed in other ways in Italy, where it was at one time a 
national holiday. See Field (1990), Quaggiotto (1988) and 
Toschi (1963).

these churches sponsored the only Saint Joseph's tables held 
in Pueblo. The tradition is waning, and altar makers attribute 
this to the time pressures which constrict modern households, 
the expense of having a 
table and a 
diminished interest in "the 
old ways." The annual Saint Joseph's table held at one 
church, here given the pseudonym Holy Trinity, began as a 
church event in 1987. When a 
Sicilian parishioner, who is from 
an altar making family, realized the tradition might die out, he 
asked some women in the congregation if they would organize 
a 
Saint Joseph's table at Holy Trinity. Although Sicilian altar 
makers do fear the demise of the ritual, it may be parish tables 
are a 
way for it to endure, albeit in an altered form. 
In this essay, I 
discuss a 
recreation of the Sicilian 
home altar tradition in Pueblo which has undergone changes in 
both ethnicity and venue. I 
examine Saint Joseph's tables 
organized at a 
Hispanic  
church, focusing on the event held in 
1991. The church, to which I 
have given the pseudonym Saint 
i41 
Anthony's, has sponsored a 
table annually since X7.6 when a

4 The term Hispanic refers to Americans who trace their 
ancestry to Spain and/or New Mexico, unless otherwise noted. 
Some Hispanics in Pueblo often distinguish between New 
Mexico, and "old Mexico," which they call the country of 
Mexico. Terms such as Sicilian, Italian, Calabrian, Anglo and 
Czech refer to Americans of those ethnic heritages, unless 
otherwise noted. 
I 1 
Hispanic woman adopted the tradition and introduced it to her 
parish. In the discussion, I 
try to answer four questions. Why 
do Hispanics express their devotion to Joseph with a 
Sicilian 
tradition? How are messages about wealth and poverty 
conveyed through the event? How do Sicilian Puebloans and 
others feel about the Hispanic adoption? Does the situation 
reflect the broader relationship between Pueblo's Hispanic and 
Italian communities? 
The analysis of the Hispanic recreation of the Sicilian 
tradition is based on the premise that expressive cultural forms 
contain implicit and explicit messages about the community or 
communities in which they are based and, therefore, they must 
be examined in their social and historical contexts. Religion is 
the cultural base which gave rise to the transference of the 
Saint Joseph's table from Sicilians to Hispanics. Specifically, a 
Mediterranean Catholic heritage with shared folk practices had 
the greatest influence on the tradition's movement across 
ethnic boundaries. The most relevant element of this folk 
Catholicism is a 
special devotion to Saint Joseph. 
However, the Saint Joseph's table is an expressive 
cultural form which contains not only religious messages but 
statements about economics. Rooted in Sicily's highly classist 
society, tension and interplay between wealth and poverty are

encoded in the tradition, most obviously in the way in which 
Joseph, the patron of the poor, is honored with an expensive 
and conspicuous display of food. According to Quaggiotto 
(1988), this apparent contradiction is the result of a 
highly 
complex social, religious and economic history. 
In Pueblo, this history has acquired yet another layer. 
When Italian immigrants arrived in Colorado in search of 
economic opportunities in the late 1800's and early 1900's, 
they found themselves relegated to society's poorest sectors, a 
pattern repeated in other parts of the United States. In Pueblo, 
Italian immigrants, along with other newcomers from southern 
and eastern Europe, joined local Hispanics at the bottom tiers 
of Pueblo society. Today, however, Italian Puebloans 
generally have attained a 
higher economic status than 
Hispanics. This disparity emerges in the Hispanic recreation of 
the Sicilian tradition. In comparison to abundant Sicilian altars, 
relatively simpler tables are presented by altar givers at Saint 
Anthony's Church. Economic differences between Hispanics 
and Italians is also expressed in the critiques of tables offered 
by participants at table events. 
Much of this discourse includes ethnic issues which 
are, of course, closely tied to economics and religion. The 
Saint Joseph's table is a 
highly ethnically-keyed event which 
5 
r 
I 
I 
emphasizes the Sicilian community's common ethnic identity 
and heritage (Turner and Seriff 1993:91). To some degree in 
Pueblo, however, the tradition has broadened its ethnic 
affiliation to include other Italian Americans who may or may 
not have observed Saint Joseph's Day in the past. Despite a 
primary affiliation with Sicily, some Sicilian Puebloans invite 
other ethnic groups to engage in the tradition, and seem to 
accept the ritual's adoption by non-Sicilian Italians, Slovenians 
and by Holy Trinity Church, whose members are of mostly non-
Hispanic European heritages. 5 Reactions to the tradition's 
adoption by Hispanics, however, range from very positive to 
neutral to strongly opposed. 
To set the stage for further discussions of the religious, 
economic and ethnic issues which emerge in the Hispanic 
recreation of the Sicilian home altar tradition, I 
begin with 
descriptions of Sicilian home tables and of the event held at 
Saint Anthony's Church in 1991. 1 
then present a 
brief history 
of Pueblo and its Italian and Hispanic communities. An 
examination of the religious heritage which I 
believe brought 
about the tradition's cross-ethnic transference follows. Next, 
5 Parishioners and others say Holy Trinity has many Italians 
and a 
few Hispanics. Precise percentages were not available 
from the church nor the diocese.

discuss economic issues which are encoded in the tradition 
and refigured with a 
local interpretation in Pueblo. I 
close with 
an examination of ethnic issues which emerge through the 
social performance of the Hispanic table. 
However, I 
begin with a 
discussion of the research 
experience to disentangle subjective issues involved in 
collecting and analyzing ethnographic data and writing 
ethnographies. Introduced in this examination is a 
sub-theme 
of the report: ethnicity has a 
dynamic and personal nature, and 
it is a 
complex and changing subject with real political and 
social consequences (Waters, 1990: xiii).

THE INFLUENCE OF PERSONAL EXPERIENCES 
IN AN ETHNOGRAPHIC STUDY 
Doing ethnographic fieldwork, selecting 
methodological approaches, interpreting data and writing 
ethnographies involve many difficult issues. As a 
graduate 
student I 
was alerted to potential problems through the work 
of anthropologists such as James Clifford (1988), James 
Clifford and George Marcus (1986), Americo Paredes (1977), 
Renato Rosaldo (1989), and Dan Rose (1987). 1 
learned to 
often ask questions about my fieldwork and analysis. Am I 
distorting data in the way I 
gather it? By whom I 
chose to 
interview? By my own biases and experiences? Am I 
letting 
my opinions determine the direction of this report, or am I 
just 
following the leads presented by the data? Have I 
spoken to 
enough people? And did I 
ask the best questions? (See the 
appendix for information on methodology.) 
Also, how should I 
write the report and organize the 
material? How much of my own experiences should be in the 
essay? I 
followed examples by anthropologists Douglas Foley 
(1990) and Barbara Myerhoff (1978), and fellow graduate 
students Paul Kvinta (1990) and Dorothy Zinn (1990). 1 
liked 
the presence of their voices coupled with the discourse of the 
8 
r 
people with whom they worked. I 
was also influenced by 
ethnographies written by Richard Flores (1989), Paul Kvinta 
(ibid), Americo Paredes (1958), Manuel Pena (1985) and 
Suzanne Seriff (1989)—not only because they worked with 
Mexican Americans but because their research dealt with 
expressive cultural forms of social and political contestation 
(Lombard i-Satriani 1974). 
I 
researched the Saint Joseph's table for the project 
Italian-Americans in the West (IAW) at the American Folklife 
Center (AFC). Pueblo was the last field site chosen by the 
project director, to whom I 
wrote in 1989 for a 
position on the 
research team. When the director called, he told me IAW was 
a 
Columbus Quincentenary project. I 
knew numerous local, 
national and international activities (e.g. parades, galas, 
movies, exhibits, symposia, concerts) were planned in Europe 
and the Americas for the Quincentenary. However, many 
activities were canceled due to the controversy surrounding 
Columbus and his legacy. The impact of Columbus' claim to 
the "New World" for Spain (then called Castille and Aragon) in 
1492 began a 
horrific era for America's indigenous people 
which continues today. Could I 
participate in a 
Quincentennial

project? It was not an easy decision, and I 
sometimes feel I 
made a 
wrong moral choice. 
When Italian American congressmen argued for a 
Quincentennial activity focusing on their ethnic group, the IAW 
project was created. An Italian myself, I 
understood the 
importance they attached to Columbus. My family was proud 
of the great navigator who conquered the unknown, proved the 
world was round and "discovered America." Although I 
observed Columbus Day only by watching New York City's 
Columbus Day parade on the news, the holiday had meaning. 
Perhaps this was because of my experiences in Dalton, 
Massachusetts, the small town where I 
grew up. In Dalton, 
from an early age, I 
encountered racism in the form of jokes, 
insinuations and outright insults, mostly from Irish Americans. 
A 
junior high school teacher, who was Irish, made 
jokes about dirty and cowardly Italians while discussing World 
War II, ignoring the sneers and spitballs directed at me by 
other students. An Irish teacher in high school often joked 
about the Mafia in class and insinuated my father was involved 
in organized crime. My peers called me a 
wop, dago and 
guinea, and made jokes about the Mafia and stupid, dirty and 
cowardly Italians. A 
friend implied Italians were akin to niggers 
(the most hated group in Dalton) because Italy is right next to 
10 
if 
Africa. "That's why you tan so easily," she said one day. In 
Dalton's Rotary Club's variety shows at the high school, I 
watched skits which made fun of Italians. To my amazement, a 
few Italian businessmen acted in the skits, which were 
orchestrated by the show's Irish director. I 
took some solace 
in, however, that although New York also had a 
Saint Patrick's 
Day parade, Saint Patrick's Day was not a 
national holiday. 
Columbus Day was, and Columbus was Italian. 
Still, I 
dreaded going to school on Saint Patrick's Day. 
would be teased, asked to sing Irish songs and see maps of 
Italy painted green with "Green With Envy" written on them. 
One Saint Patrick's Day, there was a 
green snow sculpture at 
the high school. "What is it?" I 
wondered as the bus pulled up. 
As I 
got closer I 
realized it was a 
middle finger rising from a 
fist. 
Instantly I 
felt better, realizing my feelings were not isolated. 
Years later, while working on this report, I 
would read how Irish 
Americans were instrumental in making Columbus into a 
national figure (Williams 1992), and wonder how Irish 
Americans in Dalton would receive this information. 
During the 1960's and 1970's, although I 
continued to 
value Columbus' daring and navigational skills, I 
learned 
people suffered tremendously as a 
result of his 
accomplishments, and that his racist legacy lived on. On

television, I 
saw the events at Pine Ridge and was prompted to 
read Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee. I 
also read about the 
Holocaust. On television, I 
watched marches led by Martin 
Luther King and hateful white people harassing the 
participants. In the comfort of my middle-class home, I 
saw 
poverty beyond belief, race riots and horrific scenes from the 
Vietnam War. 
I 
realized though I 
was harassed, I 
was extremely 
fortunate: I 
wasn't Black, Indian, Jewish or Vietnamese. I 
also 
realized the racists I 
saw on television were like my peers and 
teachers--and some of my relatives who did not like Jews or 
Blacks. Once when they were discussing a 
racist remark about 
Italians by someone's boss, I 
asked, "How come you don't like 
it when people make fun of Italians, but you don't like Negroes 
or Jewish people just because they are Negro or Jewish?" 
"You," they responded, "just don't understand." 
did understand--that racism is so emotionally based 
that reason plays no part in the issue, and that it is deeply 
ingrained in American society. This explains why, for example, 
at a 
class reunion in 1993, an alumnus remarked to the only 
Black person in our class, "You don't mind if I 
call you a 
nigger, 
do you, since we're all friends here?" Or why a 
friend can 
make derogatory remarks about Italians in my presence, even 
12 
though she knows it hurts me. It is why a 
relative was truly 
amazed when a 
Black woman moved to his neighborhood--and 
there was not an increase in crime. Or why a 
Jewish friend 
spoke bitterly about discrimination she suffered in Colorado, 
but made fun of Mexican Americans. Such seemingly mild 
instances indicate the depth to which racism has infiltrated 
American society. 
These were some of the memories and issues which 
came to mind when I 
discovered the IAW project was a 
Quincentennial activity, and during the course of researching 
and writing this report. While trying to rationalize my 
participation in the IAW project, I 
reminded myself that 
anthropology is a 
discipline rooted in the imperialism and 
racism symbolized by Columbus. Its origins, methodologies 
and interpretations, although now critically addressed, have 
largely been constructed by white, educated, wealthy 
European and European American men whose works were 
influenced by ethnocentrism, racism, classism and sexism. 
Ironically, it was my experiences with racism which made me 
appreciate cultural differences and want to study anthropology 
in the first place . 
Obviously, I 
did accept a 
position on the IAW project. 
However, when I 
started to work on this report in the fall of

1992, my guilt resurfaced. I 
read that in Trinidad, the Colorado 
town in which I 
lived, an Italian American organization was 
organizing a 
Columbus Day Parade in honor of Columbus' 
"discovery of America." In nearby Raton, New Mexico, I 
saw 
buttons which said, "The Discovery of America" next to a 
portrait of Columbus. They still believed that Columbus 
"discovered" America. Also that fall, American Indians were 
confronting the Federation of Italian Americans over their 
annual Columbus Day Parade in Denver (Colorado, in 1907, 
was the first state to make Columbus Day an official holiday). 
They cited the atrocities of Columbus and the ways in which 
Indians continue to be exploited. They wanted to stop the 
parade, which they saw as a 
glorification of Columbus and his 
legacy. In its place they suggested an Italian Heritage Parade, 
or a 
celebration of America's cultural diversity. The Italian 
Federation canceled the parade minutes before it was to begin. 
In Pueblo, however, Italian Americans laid a 
wreath at 
a 
bust of Columbus (the monument was dedicated in 1905 and 
is one of the oldest American memorials to the navigator). 
Pueblo's Columbus Lodge also held their 96th annual 
Columbus Day dinner. Many Colorado politicians attended the 
banquet, including Native American senatorial candidate Ben 
Nighthorse Campbell. Campbell had also marched with 
14 
OF 
Columbus' descendent in the 1991 Rose Bowl Parade in 
Pasadena, California. Other Indians who staged a 
protest 
were not able to stop Pueblo's festivities. 
These Columbus Day events illustrate how some 
Italian Americans have constructed a 
particular ethnic identity. 
According to Donald Tricarico, there are three frames of 
references from which to choose when constructing Italian 
American identities: 
One constructs an identity in terms of the 
life of the Italian'contadino,' or peasant. A 
second is grounded in the immigrant 
experience and emphasis on 'la famiglia' 
(the family) and hard work. A 
third is the so-
called 'Renaissance motif whereby a 
'direct 
kinship is established between second and 
third generation Italian-Americans and such 
renowned figures as Dante, DaVinci and 
Michaelangelo' (1984:23). 
Clearly, Columbus fits into the Renaissance motif 
category. Further, in contrast to the many negative portrayals 
of Italians, Columbus offers an "uncontaminated" symbol of 
and for Italian Americans and a 
counterpoint to the racist 
stereotypes which haunt Italians (ibid). Thus, for many Italian 
Americans it is frustrating to have Columbus attacked and 
portrayed as a 
racist himself. A 
colleague who is involved in

several cultural projects in Pueblo has read anonymous letters 
printed in "Tell it to the Chieftain," an editorial column in the 
local paper, The Pueblo Chieftain. In the column, Columbus 
Day has been criticized by non-Italians and defended by 
Italians. When Columbus Day was criticized in meetings, she 
has heard Italians exclaim, "Leave our holiday alone!" 
For Sicilian Puebloans, the Saint Joseph's table, in 
contrast to the Renaissance motif, promotes a 
glamorized 
peasant heritage which highlights the family and hard work. 
Tricarico states identification with Italian peasants and the 
immigrant experience promotes "the expressive emotional 
satisfaction of ethnic belonging" and affirms 
solidarity and a 
meaningful identity within  
the group. References to idealized ethnic 
traditions establish an 'ethnic soul' or 
'symbolic estate' which distinguishes group 
members from nonmembers... Formal 
gatherings of ethnic insiders furnish 
'backstage' opportunities for the display of 
'cultural literacy' and 'ethnic signaling' (ibid). 
For some Sicilian Puebloans, the adoption of the Saint 
Joseph's table by Hispanics infringes on this in-group identity 
and blurs the distinction between members of the group and 
non-members. Thus, some Sicilian Puebloans react negatively 
to the adoption of the tradition by Hispanics because Hispanics 
16 
are, unfortunately, still in some ways and by some people 
stigmatized in Pueblo. Also, now that Columbus and 
Columbus Day have been publicly discredited, it may be too 
much to bear the infringement on yet another Italian holiday. 
Other interesting examples of ethnic identities and 
choices emerged in the course of my fieldwork. The priest at 
Saint Anthony's, the Hispanic church which adopted the 
Sicilian tradition, told me many in the parish dislike being 
called Mexicans since they trace their ancestry to Spain and/or 
southern Colorado and northern New Mexico. He was also 
concerned about parishioners originally from, or whose 
ancestors were from, areas inhabited by Pueblo Indians in 
northern New Mexico, and who had an apparent unwillingness 
to acknowledge an Indian heritage to the same degree as their 
Spanish background. Their apparent apathy towards Native 
American opposition to the Columbus Quincentenary also 
concerned him. Like many Hispanics in New Mexico and 
Colorado, they do not acknowledge a 
connection to Native 
Americans, Mexican Americans or the country of Mexico. This 
choice in ethnic affiliation is also controversial within the larger 
Indian-Hispanic-Mexican community. 
I 
spoke with a 
Slovenian woman who adopted the Saint 
Joseph's table tradition from her Sicilian in-laws. I 
asked her

about Sicilians who were angry that The Pueblo Chieftain had 
published an article in 1992 which focused on my research on 
the Hispanic table. She said they could have featured Italians 
since 1992 was the 500th anniversary of Columbus' discovery 
of America. In fact, invitations to one table that year were 
printed with, 'This year marks the 500 year anniversary for the 
discovery of America by Christopher Columbus and the Italian-
American heritage." As is typical of Columbus Day 
celebrations by Italian Americans, the fact that Columbus 
"discovered America" for Spain is omitted. After this 
conversation, I 
remembered Spain, not Italy, ruled Sicily at the 
time of Columbus' voyages. I 
wondered if anyone I 
had 
interviewed knew this, and if and how that information would 
have changed Sicilian reactions to the Hispanic adoption of the 
table tradition. 
When I 
decided to work on the IAW project, I 
thought, 
"Well, at least I 
am studying my own ethnic group!" This would 
mitigate misinterpretation and misrepresentation, although the 
shared ethnicity of the researcher and the people with whom 
she works is not a 
guarantee of accurate data and its 
interpretation. I 
felt confident, however, about my ability to 
work with Pueblo's Italian community. I 
would be able to relate 
18 
IF 
to them as a 
fellow ethnic and Coloradan, and a 
fan of Italian 
and Italian American culture. Also, I 
had conducted a 
survey 
on Italian Texans for the Institute of Texan Cultures (1980), 
and the IAW project director had assigned me a 
topic with 
which I 
was familiar through research I 
had done in Dallas, and 
the work of friends and folklorists Kay Turner and Suzanne 
Seriff in a 
town in central Texas (1993, 1988). 
1 
did consider my religious beliefs a 
possible hindrance 
to the project. Raised as a 
Catholic, I 
disagreed with most of 
the church's social and religious doctrines and left the church 
while in high school. Over the years I 
have developed an 
eclectic spirituality which includes some Catholic traditions 
along with others from a 
variety of belief systems. I 
knew 
someone in Pueblo would ask, as people in Texas had done, 
"So are you Catholic?" 1 
usually respond, "I'm Italian! We're all 
raised Catholic!" or "I'm not much of a 
church-goer." Is this 
unethical? I 
want people to be open with me but I 
hesitate to 
share my religious views. I 
do not want them to think that I 
do 
not respect their beliefs just because I 
do not share them. I 
do, 
obviously, have an appreciation for Catholic rituals and folk 
expressions, which I 
acquired from four very religious Italian 
aunts. My interest, however, comes from the viewpoint of a 
folklorist, not from religious devotion.

knew my interactions with Italian Puebloans could be 
influenced by other factors, including differences in economic 
background, education levels, age, gender, political opinions 
and personalities. However, I 
knew Italians tend to cooperate 
in projects which document their history and traditions because 
they are important to them. Italian Americans have told me "it is 
about time" their history is studied as much as the "other 
minorities" who "get all the attention." "Italians are a 
minority 
too," I 
have heard more than once, in Colorado, Texas and 
Massachusetts. 
As expected, Italian Puebloans cooperated with the 
IAW researchers, and were very friendly, open and extremely 
generous, inviting us into their homes and to family events and 
assisting us in numerous ways. With their assistance, we were 
able to document much about Italians in Pueblo through 
archival research, oral histories and photographs. However, I 
was concerned about the project's short duration. Would we be 
able to collect substantive data in two or three weeks? I 
knew 
a 
Geertzian "thick description" (1973) of the Saint Joseph's 
table would be impossible. But could I 
obtain more than a 
surface description of the tradition? 
About a 
week after the IAW researchers arrived in 
Pueblo, a 
journalist from The Pueblo Chieftain told me she had 
20 
interviewed a 
Hispanic woman who prepared a 
Saint Joseph's 
table at a 
Hispanic church. She could not, however, remember 
the name of the woman nor the church. Because I 
knew 
Sicilians and Hispanics share a 
devotion to Joseph as well as 
other religious practices, I 
was not surprised to find they had 
adopted the tradition. Having developed an interest in 
Mexican American culture while living in Texas, I 
wanted to find 
out about the Hispanic table. I 
also thought it was important to 
include Hispanics in the project just as I 
had spoken to a 
Slovenian woman who prepared a 
home table, and three 
women who were, respectively, Czech, Calabrese (Calabria is 
a 
southern Italian state) and Piemontese (Piemonte is a 
northern Italian state) who organize the annual table at Holy 
Trinity Church. They had all learned about the Saint Joseph's 
table from their Sicilian in-laws. 
A 
few altar makers had heard about a 
Hispanic Saint 
Joseph's table but did not know anything about it. With the 
assistance of a 
Hispanic maid at the motel where the IAW 
team stayed, I 
finally contacted the woman who organizes the 
annual table at Saint Anthony's Church, a 
predominantly 
Hispanic parish. She wondered why I 
wanted to include her in 
a 
project on Italians. After I 
explained my reasons she 
discussed my request with her priest, who approved of our

meeting. After the interview, I 
told the IAW project director that 
Pueblo was fascinating because the tradition had crossed 
ethnic boundaries in a 
such a 
significant way. 
When I 
returned to Austin, I 
told Kay Turner and 
Suzanne Seriff about the Hispanic table. They were excited 
and encouraged me to make it the topic of my master's report. 
As mentioned, both had studied the tradition in Texas. Turner 
had also studied an Italian American saint's processional in 
Brooklyn (1979) and done extensive research on Mexican 
American home altars (1990, 1982). Seriff had written about 
the Days of the Dead, which includes an altar tradition, in 
Oaxaca, Mexico (1984). Familiar with the similarities between 
Italian and Mexican folk religious customs, they too were not 
surprised that Hispanics were preparing Saint Joseph's tables. 
In fact, Turner had heard of a 
Mexican American family in San 
Antonio, Texas, who had done the same. I 
later found out that 
Hispanics in a 
community in northern New Mexico (Eva 
Cordova: personal communication) and Mexican Americans in 
Wheeling, Illinois (Holly Kyed: personal communication), had 
adopted the Sicilian Saint Joseph's table. 6 
6 Tables are now also organized at Catholic churches with 
mixed ethnic parishes in Dallas, Houston and Austin, Texas, 
and in Denver and Trinidad, Colorado. David C. Estes found

if 
While writing an outline for my master's report, 
thought about Pueblo, not the Saint Joseph's tradition in Dallas 
on which I 
had planned to write. I 
called the IAW project 
director, who said I 
would have access to the data collected by 
the IAW crew and the AFC would finance a 
trip to Pueblo in 
March 1991 so I 
could attend the Hispanic table and visit other 
tables. I 
remembered a 
conversation with a 
visiting folklorist at 
the university. When I 
told him I 
was interested in Mexican and 
Italian American culture, he advised me to chose one or the 
other. Pueblo offered me the opportunity to study both. 
However, now I 
couldn't be so smug about researching my own 
ethnic group! 
I 
do sometimes feel presumptuous when conducting 
fieldwork, as I 
did when I 
went to Mexico in December 1990 as 
the assistant to the director of a 
project on folk toys. Despite 
the director's cultural sensitivity, high professional standards 
and academic qualifications, the project highlighted for me the 
problems of ethnographic research and its products (i.e. 
exhibits, publications, documentaries, symposia, and academic 
an African American Spiritualist Church in New Orleans which 
adopted the ritual from the city's Sicilian community because it 
fit in well with the church's annual cycle of saints' days (1987).

prestige and professional advancement for scholars.) The 
project was fun and fascinating, but it struck me as absurd. 
Relatively wealthy and educated American women, one Jewish 
and the other of eclectic spirituality, who were not native 
Spanish speakers, were interviewing generally poor male 
artisans with little formal education who made many of their 
toys for Catholic festivals. Further, the toys and documentation 
on which the project was based were collected 30 years earlier 
by a 
Jewish doctoral student from New York City who did not 
speak Spanish well. 
My fieldwork in Mexico made me think about Pueblo 
three months later when I 
would attend the Saint Joseph's 
table at Saint Anthony's Church. I 
remembered an article in 
which Americo Paredes related how the ethnocentrism and 
poor Spanish language skills of anthropologists studying 
Chicanos in south Texas had resulted in distorted data and 
faulty interpretations (1977). Could I 
work with Hispanics? 
What problems would arise? Could I 
obtain quality data in five 
days? Could I 
gain anyone's trust? Since my second session 
in the field was so short, I 
decided to focus on two questions. 
Why did a 
Hispanic woman adopt a 
Sicilian tradition to honor 
Joseph? What messages are conveyed via the event? 
24 
iI 
to 
In Pueblo, however, I 
learned people who were angry 
that "Mexicans had stolen their tradition" had called the 
Hispanic altar maker. Because a 
full exploration of the 
complex issues of in-group and out-group ethnic labeling in 
Pueblo is beyond the scope of this essay, suffice it to say the 
term "Mexican" was taken as an insult, as it was surely meant 
to be. When I 
heard about the phone calls, I 
formulated other 
avenues for investigation. What did Sicilians think about the 
tradition's Hispanic adoption? And, how does the adopted 
event reflect the wider context of the relationship between 
Hispanic and Italian Puebloans? 
Before exploring these questions in the analysis of the 
Hispanic recreation of the Sicilian tradition at Saint Anthony's 
Church, however, I 
want to discuss the altar tradition as 
Sicilian Americans in Pueblo have performed it. This 
description is given to illustrate both the tradition's general 
format and how altar makers shape the ritual. I 
then present a 
description of a 
table event at Saint Anthony's Church so 
readers will have a 
sense of the similarities to and differences 
between the Hispanic parish table and Sicilian home tables.

"THE REAL WAY:" 
SICILIAN ALTARS TO SAINT JOSEPH 
Many Sicilian Pueblos promote the idea of an 
"authentic" altar and strive to make a 
table in "the real way," 
replete with the components one "needs to have" for a 
Saint 
Joseph's altar. The tradition does have a 
general structure, 
but there are local variations in Sicily and the United States, 
where Sicilian Americans recreate versions of tables from their 
specific Sicilian ancestral hometowns. Also, altar makers 
shape the ritual on the personal level. Local and personal 
variations illustrate that tradition is "not a 
bounded entity made 
up of bounded constituent parts, but a 
process of 
interpretation" (Handler and Linnekin 1984: 287). The 
following section is a 
not a 
complete description of a 
table's 
numerous components, but it gives the reader a 
sense of the 
tradition's format and the degree to which it can be shaped. 
A 
vow that initiates a 
ritual exchange between Joseph 
and a 
petitioner is the first action in the process of giving an 
altar. Petitioners promise to make the special altar on March 
19 if the saint resolves a 
crisis or assists in its resolution by 
acting as an intermediary between the petitioner and God. A 
woman or man can petition the saint but a 
male usually asks 
26 
I 
the female head of the household to prepare a 
table if Joseph 
fulfills his request. Illness, infertility and economic hardship, or 
the hope that a 
loved one will safely return home from war, 
usually motivate a 
petitioner to seek Joseph's assistance. For 
less serious problems, people may promise Joseph to help 
with a 
table, but not have one of their own. Also, some altar 
makers have prepared a 
table to thank Joseph for their family's 
well-being and prosperity. 7 
When making a 
vow, a 
petitioner may make one or 
more requests; promise to make an altar once or to have a 
table for any number of years; choose to ask for donations to 
help with the table; or decide not to accept any donations at all. 
Some Puebloans remember people who chose to "go begging" 
from house to house, or to "beg barefoot" for donations as an 
act of sacrifice. While attitudes now make this unacceptable, 
the concept of sacrifice remains important in the ritual. Altar 
givers spend substantial amounts of time, energy and money 
as a 
sacrifice undertaken as a 
labor of love and expression of 
gratitude. Despite the intentions of an altar maker to finance a 
7 Even if they do not have a 
Saint Joseph's Day table, Sicilian 
Puebloans may have a 
special dinner for their family, bake 
cookies and Saint Joseph's breads, and place an image of the 
saint in a 
prominent location in the home on March 19.

table herself, donations cannot be refused. Relatives, friends 
and even strangers provide labor, goods and money to an altar 
giver in devotion to Joseph, sometimes to fulfill a 
promise they 
made to Joseph in exchange for his assistance in a 
less 
serious matter. 
Months before the event, altar makers and their 
assistants, who are usually female relatives or friends, 
purchase and order flowers and food, prepare and freeze food, 
and organize many other details required to construct an altar, 
host an open-house, and serve a 
meal to five hundred or more 
people. The week before March 19, male relatives assemble 
the table's wood foundation in a 
large room, usually a 
living 
room. The altar often spans a 
wall from side to side and floor 
to ceiling but the size varies as determined by the size of the 
house. Women cover the three-tiered base with linens, sheets, 
table cloths or other fabrics. They might include objects that 
have personal meaning, such as linens from a 
dowry or a 
crocheted table cloth that is a 
family heirloom. One Sicilian-
born couple displayed the flags of Italy and the United States 
to show they are proud of both their heritages. 
An image of Joseph is placed on the covered altar in 
the center of the highest tier. The image may be of Joseph 
alone, Joseph holding the Infant Jesus or of the Holy Family in 
28 
11 
this family-centered event. As Quaggiotto points out, Joseph is 
the only saint whose presence implies the presence of mother 
and child (1988:288). Jesus, Mary and Joseph are portrayed 
by people during the ritual, and are also represented with 
statuettes, images on votive candles and on prayer cards, and 
in symbolic forms, such as the Sacred Heart of Jesus and 
Joseph's staff sculpted from bread. Also placed on the tables 
are photographs of the people who received Joseph's 
assistance in overcoming problems. Because the tables are 
blessed, they are sacred space within the home and the locus 
of the intersection of the sacred and the secular, of "the 
heavenly family and the earthly family" (Turner and Seriff 
1987:448). The tradition hinges on the belief that the petitioner 
and Joseph can communicate with each other and that a 
personal relationship exists between them. The photos show 
the beneficiaries of this relationship, and highlight the central 
importance of the family in the ritual. 
After the image of Joseph is in place, altar makers 
arrange candles, breads, cakes, fruit, pastries, cookies, raw 
vegetables and other foods in a 
colorful and symmetrical 
assemblage. Bouquets or planters of flowers, including lilies, 
the flower associated with Joseph, are also on the table.

and at least one elaborately decorated fish are the last dishes 
placed on the table. Certain foods must be on the altar, 
including Saint Joseph's Day breads, fried carduni (artichoke 
stalks), frittate (one for each saint represented in the ritual), a 
fish and cakes in the shape of a 
lamb, a 
cross and the Bible. 
These foods symbolize the tradition's religious nature, and its 
Sicilian and agrarian origins. 
Altar makers agree an elegant presentation should be 
created and they often use china, crystal and silverware, even 
if they have to borrow pieces. In the amount of food displayed, 
there is a 
"grandiose and exaggerated display" of abundance 
(Turner and Seriff 1987:448), "of scores and scores of choice 
edibles" (Speroni 1940:136), which is inversely rooted in the 
tradition's working class origins (Quaggiotto 1988:60-119). 
There is also a 
friendly competitiveness in the ritual's 
performance. People who view the tables praise the altar 
givers' efforts but also critique them and compare them with 
tables they themselves have given or attended. 
Some Puebloans say the table represents new life, 
which they symbolize by placing sprouted wheat, candy chicks 
and flowers on the altar. March 19 falls two days before the 
spring equinox and close to Easter, which commemorates the 
resurrection of Christ, the ultimate symbol of rebirth in 
30 
Christianity. Sicilian Puebloans connect the ritual and Easter 
through the proximity of their occurrence and with the use of 
Easter decorations on the table. Field places Saint Joseph's 
Day in the context of springtime observances such as Easter, 
Lent and carnival which are associated with pre-Christian and 
Christian rituals of rebirth (1990:331-333). 
The Feast Day of Saint Joseph usually falls during 
Lent which is a 
period of fasting and cleansing which precedes 
Easter. Participants exclude meat from the Saint Joseph's 
table, related to the time when the Catholic Church prohibited 
the consumption of meat during Lent. An elaborate meal and 
abundant presentation of food are, however, part of the ritual. 
Quaggiotto reports that until recently in Sicily, March was a 
time of hunger at the end of winter and before the growing 
season, making the tradition's requirement of superabundance 
especially burdensome (1988:80-82). 
Altar makers invite the public to view the altar usually 
beginning at noon on March 18, and continuing through the 
next day, when the main ritual occurs. News of a 
table spreads 
by word of mouth, especially through the Sicilian community. 
Altar givers also utilize the local media to announce their 
tables in an effort to invite as many people as possible. 
Because Joseph has assisted the family, they must share their 
31

I 
n 
good fortune by feeding anyone who visits a 
table. When 
March 19 falls on a 
weekend, as many as 800 people might 
visit a 
home table. 
On March 19, the principal ritual act occurs. A 
priest 
says a 
mass at the house and blesses the food on the altar. 
People who represent Jesus, Mary and Joseph then consume 
a 
multi-course ritual meal of blessed food which is served by 
the altar makers. Along with the Holy Family, other saints may 
also be represented as long as there is an odd number of holy 
figures at the table, reflecting the 13 men who participated in 
the Last Supper of Christ. Saint Ann (Mary's mother), Saint 
Anthony of Padua (an Italian saint whose attributes will be 
discussed later), and Saint Lucy (patroness of the eyes whose 
feast day is also observed by Sicilian Puebloans) are often 
included in the ritual. 
Altar givers select friends and relatives who have a 
special relationship to them and/or to the saint they represent. 
When one couple gave a 
table to thank Joseph for their 
family's well-being, they invited people who were godparents to 
themselves and their children. One man and his siblings often 
portrayed saints when they were young because people 
wanted to help them and their widowed mother. In 1992, a 
well-known tradition bearer eliminated the portrayal of the 
32 
01 
saints and their ritual meal from her table, components she had 
said was essential to the tradition. Because there had been 
much illness in the family, she thought everyone who had been 
sick should portray a 
saint. To prevent disappointment by 
omitting someone, she dedicated the table to everyone who 
had been ill, but asked no one to portray a 
saint. With this 
deletion, she preserved one of the tradition's central elements--
the unity of the family. 
People on whose behalf the altar maker petitioned 
Joseph dine with the holy personages at an elegantly adorned 
table near the altar, often directly in front of it. The honored 
guests are served the multi-course meal of the blessed food, 
and they receive boxes filled with sweets from the altar to take 
home. Other guests who visit the table are served a 
meatless 
meal with a 
main course of spaghetti with tomato sauce and 
breadballs or hard-boiled eggs. Extra tables and chairs are set 
up in the house, garage or yard to accommodate the visitors. 
Tables are dismantled the evening of March 19 or the 
following day. Altar makers distribute leftover food to the 
people who portray saints or who help prepare the table. They 
give donated monies to charities and leftover food to the local 
boys' home and soup kitchen, further honoring Joseph, who is 
patron of the poor and of charity. This charitable component is 
33 
q
I'0 
it 
also an expression of the altar maker's resources and shows 
she can amass food and monies to fulfill an obligation which is 
part of the tradition. Some altar givers send letters to the 
newspaper listing the groups to which they contributed. 
This description shows some ways in which altar 
makers shape the Saint Joseph's table. Components can be 
altered or omitted, can convey information about personal 
aesthetics, social class and economic capabilities, family 
history, cultural resources and affiliations, social networks and 
religious devotion. Yet there are commonalties in the way the 
altars are planned and constructed, which are probably 
attributable to the collective ethnic identity of the altar givers 
(Turner and Seriff 1993:91). As mentioned, in Pueblo the Saint 
Joseph's table has also been shaped in its the movement from 
the home to the church hall and from a 
family-centered ritual to 
an annual parish event at Holy Trinity and Saint Anthony's 
churches. 8 1

People have also changed tables in more significant ways. 
In 1992, an elderly woman unable fulfill a 
promise to have a 
home table prayed for Joseph's guidance. One night, in a 
vision of Joseph and Mary, she heard the words "soup 
kitchen," so she decided to pick up the tab for a 
roast beef 
dinner at Pueblo's Community Soup Kitchen (Wood, 1992:1 b).

"A WONDERFUL WAY TO HONOR JOSEPH:" 
A 
HISPANIC RECREATION OF A 
SICILIAN HOME ALTAR TRADITION 
1q 
a2•.•hL•1 
In tW, a 
Hispanic woman adopted and then the 
following year introduced the Saint Joseph's table to her parish 
because she thought it was a 
'Wonderful way to honor Joseph." 
Unfamiliar with the ritual, she asked the advice of an 
acquaintance who referred her to his Sicilian mother-in-law, 
who is a 
noted tradition bearer within the Sicilian community. 
Still concerned after receiving this expert's advice, however, 
the Hispanic woman made a 
promise to Joseph: if everything 
went well, she would prepare an altar every year she was able. 
About forty people came to her home to participate in the first 
table. Sensing the ritual was going to grow among his 
Hispanic parishioners, the priest who was then serving Saint 
Anthony's suggested the table be prepared at the church the 
next year. 9 
9 The priest, who is no longer in Pueblo, has recently asked 
the Hispanic woman for advice about preparing a 
Saint 
Joseph's table at the parish in Albuquerque, New Mexico, 
where he now works.

Saint Anthony's Church sits at the edge of a 
neighborhood of small and older houses and vacant lots. At 
the city's western limit, the area is separated from Pueblo by a 
large hospital complex and connected to town with two bridges, 
one of which is decrepit, narrow and steep bridge scheduled 
for replacement (Ruggles 1993x, 1993b). The steepled and 
stuccoed church rises above arid prairie and is adjacent to a 
small dairy. People from the area often comment that the 
church is difficult to find. The Saint Joseph's table is held in 
the parish hall, which is spacious and relatively new. Until the 
congregation built the hall, special events took place in the 
church's basement. Religious images, including crucifixes, a 
framed hand-carved wood image of Our Lady of Guadalupe, 
statues of Jesus and Mary, a 
photo of the Pope, and prints of 
artwork by Amado Pena adorn the room. Offices, restrooms 
and classrooms are on two sides of the hall, and there is a 
large kitchen in one corner of its far end. 
Like Sicilian tables, many_people and much planning 
are required to create a 
successful event. The woman who 
introduced the tradition to the church is primarily assisted by 
women in the Altar Society and in another group which 
promotes the canonization of Kateri Tekakwitha, a 
Mohawk 
woman who converted to Catholicism. Men in the Holy Name

Society set up and take down chairs, tables and a 
microphone 
and podium used by the priest when he blesses the altar. 
They tend to gather in the hall, apart from the women who are 
in the kitchen. Most of the men and women seem between 50-
80 years old, and many have known each other for a 
long time. 
Several call each other comadre or compadre, terms indicating 
a 
close personal relationship and a 
type of kinship. 
Conversations among them are in Spanish or English, and 
switching between the two languages in a 
single conversation 
or in the same sentence is common. 
On March 18 and 19, 1991, altar makers served 
coffee, pop and cookies to visitors and prepared lunch for 
themselves in the kitchen, where they chatted about the 
evening's pot luck buffet to be held as part of the festivities, 
and about their families and friends, personal religious 
experiences and church work. At least one woman greeted 
people who come to admire the table, answered their 
questions and offered them refreshments. Some visitors 
brought contributions of food for the Saint Joseph's altar, or put 
money in a 
vase on the table. 
Altar makers assembled a 
symmetrical display of 
sprouted wheat, cookies, cakes, candies, fruits, vegetables, 
wine and other foods on a 
three-tiered table. Votive candles, 
38 
0 
Easter candies, bottles of holy water, soda bottles filled with 
colored water, and vases of artificial flowers added color. The 
table, which almost spanned an entire wall, had a 
backdrop of 
a 
draped, gold cloth covered with clear plastic. The table was 
covered with yellow fabric. In 1993, an altar giver pointed out 
a 
new white lace overlay for the yellow cloth; in 1994 they had 
yet a 
different yellow table covering. Flanking both sides of the 
table are two large potted plants. 
In the center of the table, on its highest tier, was a 
statue of Joseph holding the Infant Jesus. In the early years, 
altar givers used a 
paper cross, and then a 
wood one, until a 
family began to annually loan them the statue described 
above. In 1993, however, they had to locate another statue 
because the usual donors had given theirs to an ill relative in 
the San Luis Valley of southern Colorado. Artificial lilies 
flanked the saint's statue, and in front were displayed 
representations of the Sacred Heart, the cross and a 
monstrance which are made from cut dough and filled with figs. 
These were given to the woman who adopted the tradition by 
the Sicilian tradition bearer who advised her years ago. 
There is always a 
whole fish on the table, a 
traditional 
element, placed at the front center of the table. For two years 
they used an artificial fish in place of a 
real one, along with

with one or two small plates of fried fish. There are always 
twelve round braided Saint Joseph's breads purchased from a 
bakery which emanate from the center along each side. Some 
years there were other decorative breads too. In 1994, 1 
noticed a 
bread shaped into a 
fish, decorated with whole grains 
of wheat and with a 
pistachio eye, at Saint Anthony's and Holy 
Trinity. The same Italian family had donated them to both 
tables. Cakes in the shape of a 
cross, Bible and lamb are 
loaned for use on the altar every year by the same families, 
and then returned to them after the event. An Italian woman 
from another church always donates pizzelle and other 
cookies, and an Italian family from an area east of Pueblo often 
brings fava beans and sprouted wheat for the table. Most 
items are displayed in modest amounts on ceramic plates 
covered with paper lace doilies. 
Altar makers do not invite people to portray saints but 
instead they honor guests who sit at a 
special table with the 
priest. Honorees have included homeless people who 
frequented Pueblo's public soup kitchen, nuns from local 
churches, the disabled, special-needs children, and the people 
who organize the event. In 1991, parishioners with loved ones 
at war in the Persian Gulf or at other military posts were 
honored. Soldiers' photographs were placed on the table by 
40 
P 
their relatives, who were invited to sit at the main table and 
were the first served the Saint Joseph's bread which had been 
blessed by the priest. Yellow ribbons and the American flag 
decorated the hall, and the table reserved for the special 
guests was draped in red, white and blue. 
On the evening of March 19, a 
mass at the church was 
followed by the priest's blessing of the special table. Then the 
event's principal organizer sliced a 
loaf of the blessed bread 
and distributed it to the honorees. About 100 people partook 
of a 
buffet dinner which included green chili, enchiladas, 
macaroni, potato salad, chicken, tuna casserole, desserts and 
the blessed bread. Although meat dishes are not allowed on 
the altar, meat was part of the pot luck dinner. People quietly 
spoke as they enjoyed the feast, children played together and 
two men video-taped the event. Many left after they ate but 
several lingered for an hour or so. The crowd consisted mostly 
of extended families with an even distribution of people based 
on age and gender. Within approximately three hours of the 
table's blessing, most of the visitors had left, and the women 
had almost finished cleaning the kitchen and main hall. Like 
Sicilian altar makers, they donated leftover food and collected 
money to charities.

In general, the tables I 
have seen at Saint Anthony's 
Church over four years (1991-1994) have been very similar. 
Each year, however, there were some changes, such as the 
table covering, new food items, colorful yarn vases, and 
different flowers. Compared to previous tables (the earliest in

) 
which I 
had seen documented in photo albums, the most 
recent tables were much more abundant. The same trend is 
true for the Saint Joseph's altars constructed at Holy Trinity 
Church: they have become more elaborate and elegant since 
they began in 1987. 
I 
knew the altar givers prepared tables to express their 
faith and devotion to Joseph, and as a 
special celebration for 
their church. The woman who adopted the tradition and then 
introduced it to her parish has a 
special fondness for Joseph, 
who she likens to her father and to all fathers who protect their 
families and put them above everything else. She remembers 
her mother telling her father to teach their sons whatever task 
he was doing, "Just like Joseph did with Jesus." Her mother 
would tell the children, "Help your father like Jesus helped 
Joseph." As is common in Hispanic culture, her father and 
brother have Jose (Joseph) as their first names but they are 
called by their middle names. 
42

I 
asked why a 
Hispanic parish would use a 
Sicilian 
ritual to honor Joseph. "Because," the primary altar giver said, 
"it is a 
wonderful way to honor Joseph," and to "spread the 
word about Joseph." I 
asked if at the time of her first table she 
had worried that she might anger Sicilians. No, she said, she 
worried because she had never prepared a 
table' before and it 
might not turn out well--that is why she had prayed to Joseph 
before the first table. On March 19, 1992, 1 
walked with her to 
the church to attend mass. With a 
wave of her arm she 
indicated the people entering the church and said, "See, this is 
what it's all about." When I 
posed the same question in 1993, 
she said, "We do all these things for the other saints, but 
nothing for Joseph--I wanted to do something special for him." 
Another time she responded, as the priest once did, "Saint 
Joseph speaks Spanish too." Three people had answered, 
"Saint Joseph isn't just for Italians." 
I 
do believe devotion to Joseph was probably the only 
reason why the principle altar giver had initially adopted the 
tradition, and why the parish has accepted it so readily. 
However, I 
also believe that over the years the event has 
acquired political connotations which must be viewed in their 
historical and contemporary social contexts. In the next 
section, I

Pueblo, which is followed by a

Joseph's table to better understand the event as a

PUEBLO'S  HISPANIC AND ITALIAN COMMUNITIES: 
A 
BRIEF HISTORY 
The transference of the Sicilian tradition to Hispanics 
offers a 
complex example of inter-ethnic relations in the 
Southwest. Much of the social scientific research on Hispanics 
examines Anglo-Hispanic relationships using a 
hegemonic and 
counter-hegemonic model. This is understandable given the 
impact Anglo Americans have exerted on Hispanics. However, 
the Southwest is a 
multi- cultural region inhabited by people 
whose heritages span the globe. Inter-ethnic dynamics are 
complex and do not always neatly fit a 
hegemonic model, as is 
the case of Italians and Hispanics in Pueblo. 
Little work has been conducted on interactions 
between Italians and Latinos (a broad term which includes 
Hispanics) in the United States. One exception is The 
Immigrant World of Ybor City. Italians and Their Latin 
Neighbors in Tampa, 1885-1985, an excellent study of Cuban 
and Italian workers in cigar factories conducted by Mormino 
and Pozzetta (1987). A 
few scholars have dealt to a 
limited 
extent with the relationships between Italians and Hispanics in 
Colorado. In Bessemer: A 
Sociological Perspective of a 
Chicano Barrio, Irene Blea refers superficially to relationships 
45 
0 
p 
between Hispanics and Italians in Pueblo's Bessemer 
neighborhood (1980). Deutsch (1987), Notarianni (1980) and 
Schuler (1988) touch upon the relationships between the two 
groups in the context of the mining and labor history of 
southern Colorado and northern New Mexico. 
Compared to the plethora of ethnographic and 
historical studies done on Italian Americans in the eastern and 
mid-western United States, little in-depth scholarly research 
has been conducted on the group in the western states. Some 
notable exceptions exist, however, including Bohme (1958), Di 
Leonardo (1984), Fichera (1981), Martinelli (1984), Mullens 
(1974), Notarianni (1980) and Taylor and Williams (1992). Of 
special interest to my research is the work of Kay Turner and 
Suzanne Seriff on the Saint Joseph's table tradition in central 
Texas. Using feminist theory as a 
framework, they published 
"'Giving an Altar:' The Ideology of Reproduction in a 
St. 
Joseph's Day Feast" in the Journal of American Folklore 
(1987), and "Giving an Altar to St. Joseph: A 
Feminist 
Perspective on a 
Patronal Feast" in Feminist Theory and the 
Study of Folklore (1993). 
The history and cultures of the Hispanic and Native 
American Southwest have been studied by many scholars.

Mexico form a 
distinct historical and cultural zone (Camps 
1979; Espinosa 1990 [1985]; Mehls and Carter 1984; and 
Weigle and White 1988). Many people at Saint Anthony's 
Church trace their ancestry to northern New Mexico, which was 
originally inhabited by Pueblo and Plains Indians. The city of 
Pueblo's history begins with the presence of Plains Indians 
such as Kiowa, Arapahoe, Ute, Cheyenne and Comanche who 
were attracted by the natural resources provided by the 
Arkansas and Fountain Rivers. Spaniards arrived in the 
Southwest and explored much of the area in the 16th century. 
But settlements in New Spain's northern frontier were few and 
isolated, and trade between •
yNyyee•w` Spain and the United States 
was illegal. However, 4tftGding did occur between fur 
traders, various Indian groups and fur trappers. 
When the United States purchased the Louisiana 
Territory from France in 1803, trappers and traders who came 
in the area to pursue beaver and buffalo established some 
temporary settlements. When Mexico gained independence 
from Spain in 1821, the new government offered land grants to 
encourage permanent settlements and to establish a 
defense 
against raiding Indian tribes, the United States and the 
Republic of Texas. The juncture of the Arkansas and Fountain 
rivers formed a 
natural boundary between Spain, later Mexico, 
47 
and the United States. Mexico, unlike Spain, encouraged 
trade with its citizens in the north. Beginning in 1821, the 
Santa Fe Trail, with terminal points in Santa Fe and at various 
locations in Missouri, brought commercial and cultural 
exchange between Americans and Mexicans. 
According to Nostrand, Pueblo was founded in 1842 by 
twelve Anglo men who constructed a 
trading fort, Fort Pueblo, 
at the crossing of the Arkansas River and Fountain Creek 
(1992:193-202). They built across the river from Mexican 
territory where American trade restrictions could be ignored. 
Most of Pueblo's founders were married or united with Hispanic 
women from Taos and all probably employed Hispanic 
laborers. Nostrand writes that Hispanics at first outnumbered 
Anglos, but dwindled to 60, or 9% of Pueblo's 660 residents, by 
1870, and of the 60 Hispanics, all the adults were from New 
Mexico, all the men worked for Anglos, none owned land, and 
there were no Hispanic women with Anglo husbands. 
In 1846, the United States declared war on Mexico in a 
quest to acquire new territory, which includes what is now the 
American Southwest and California. American merchants had 
capitalized on this desire for territorial expansion by arguing 
that Mexican traders on the Santa Fe Trail had unfair 
advantages due to different tariffs in Mexico and the United 
48 
States. The United States won the war and in 1848 a 
tremendous amount of land, including the territories of 
Colorado and New Mexico, was ceded by Mexico in the Treaty 
of Guadalupe Hidalgo. The victory brought Pueblo, on the 
edge of American territory, firmly under American control. In 
1854, a 
raid by Utes brought an end to the fort. 
Railroads arrived in Colorado in the 1870's, eventually 
rendering the Santa Fe Trail and other caravan routes 
obsolete. By the turn of the century four rail companies served 
Pueblo, and their need for iron rails led to the development of 
the Colorado Fuel and Iron Company (CF&I) in Pueblo. 
Railroads joined with regional coal mining and ore processing 
and the three industries quickly expanded. Because of the 
smelting of gold, silver, copper and lead, coal mining, and iron 
and steel manufacturing, Pueblo's economy boomed. CF&I 
became the center of the region's steel industry until the 1920's 
when the demand for coal decreased with the use of natural 
gas and the country entered the Great Depression. 
Many Italian immigrants arrived in the Pueblo area 
during the economic boom driven by the railroad, mining and 
ore processing (Deutsch 1987; Mehls and Carter 1984; and 
Scamehorn 1976). They found occupational and social 
positions at the bottom tier of society working in the mines and 
49 
steel mills and on the railroad. Some became farmers, grocers 
and bar and restaurant owners who largely served the mill 
laborers and the Italian community. According to Nostrand, by 
1900 Pueblo's population swelled to 28,172 with immigrants 
and others seeking work while Hispanics constituted less than 
2% of the population (1992:193-202). He writes that Hispanics 
were highly segregated into five areas: the Mexican Settlement 
(a barrio where many household heads were laborers at the 
steel mills), in Goat Hill (a largely Italian neighborhood whose 
Italian and Hispanic men worked at a 
smelter), and in three 
areas south of CF&I. 
According to Nostrand, by 1930, significant 
immigration to Pueblo from Mexico had occurred, and Mexican 
nationals outnumbered Hispanics. The possibility of a 
better 
life, Nostrand continues, began to attract increasingly more 
Hispanics from northern New Mexico and southern Colorado. 
By 1950, they represented 10.2% of Pueblo's population and 
15.5% in 1980, when Mexican origin individuals numbered 
16.9%. While some Hispanics and Mexicans were integrated 
residentially with Anglos, most were concentrated in 13 
districts, including the neighborhood in which Saint Anthony's 
Church is located. According to the 1992 City of Pueblo Data 
Book, Hispanics (here meant as an inclusive category which 
50 
includes Hispanics, Mexican Americans and other Latinos) 
number 40% of Pueblo's population. 
Hispanic and European immigrant laborers were 
exploited by Anglos in the region's mineral extraction, refining 
and manufacturing industries (Beshoar 1980[1970]; Blea 1980; 
Deutsch 1987; Frank 1992; Notarianni 1980, Papanikolas 
1982; and Schuler 1988). For many years, CF&I's Sociological 
Department divided workers and their families by ethnicity--and 
at the same time was charged with Americanizing them. 
According to Blea, with its ethnic segregational policies and 
exploitation in the workplace, CF&I "molded Pueblo into a 
classist and racist town," continuously using "class, race and 
sex as means by which to divide its working class population 
and keep them from organizing" (1980:125-126). 
Blea states that as late as the mid-1970's, five of 
CF&I's subsidiary industries were charged with discrimination 
in every department (ibid:108-109). Anglos were assigned to 
"clean" departments and Spanish-surnamed workers to "dirty" 
departments. Unions were criticized for controlling provisions 
that forced Spanish-surnamed workers into lower-paying and 
more hazardous jobs. They were rarely promoted to 
supervisory positions, and they had a 
high incidence of 
51 
r 
injuries, experiencing four out of five deaths in four years. A 
CF&I worker interviewed by Blea said, 
Yes, there is discrimination. I 
am an 
example of that, I 
would say. I 
worked out 
there for 43 years. I 
was the first Mexican 
quality control inspector. Everyone was 
surprised. They (workers) used to think I 
was Italian ... They would say that I 
looked 
Italian. I 
had always hoped to be promoted 
to superintendent. That was my dream. It 
never happened after all those years. 
learned about discrimination on the 
job ... With all my knowledge, all my 
schooling and education I 
never got 
promoted because my name is Jesus 
Andres Montano (ibid, 112). 
Blea says racism could be clearly felt between Italians 
and Mexicans (here Mexican refers collectively to Hispanics, 
Chicanos, Mexicans and Mexican Americans). Some Mexican 
CF&I workers in Blea's study called Italians "Anglos" to signal 
their higher status, and spoke of friction between Italians and 
Mexicans. Italian men, however, who worked for CF&I echo 
the same experiences of Hispanics: 
The mill was a 
place of infernal heat and 
insidious discrimination against non-Anglo 
workers 
... Then there were the injuries...'It 
was a 
lot easier to replace a 
person than it 
was to replace a 
piece of machinery.' Little 
wonder that Joe Genova tried to get off the 
floor and into a 
safer and better-paying job

as a 
crane operator, only to be told by his 
supervisor, 'As long as your name ends in a 
vowel you're gonna stay down in the cellar' 
(Frank 1992:146-147). 
Interestingly, Joe Genova went to inquire about the job with a 
coworker, Joe Hernandez, who was also interested in the 
crane operator job. Both were told they had to stay in the 
cellar because their names ended in a 
vowel (Frank 1990). 
Hernandez, of course, does not end in a 
vowel, but it is a 
Spanish surname. 
"Italians were looked down upon," a 
woman flatly told 
IAW researcher Russell Frank, "It was hard for them to get a 
job in the mill and elsewhere" (1992 147). Frank uses the 
position of a 
cranemen, one of the better blue-collar jobs at 
CF&I, as a 
gauge of discrimination: 
as recently as 1940, out of 125 cranemen, 
three were Italian, two were 'Bojons' (a local 
term for Slays) and two were Mexicans. It 
was only when the union came in 1942 that 
promotions became strict matters of 
seniority. Sam Catalano finally made 
foreman in 1964, after 25 years in the blast 
furnace. 'The name just wasn't right,' he 
said, 'Before it was just the pale faces'(ibid). 
In addition to the unions, civil rights legislation brought 
more equitable employment practices, but affected Hispanics 
and Italians differently. The new laws produced resentment 
53 
towards Hispanics and other newly officially designated 
minorities by some Italians. Many felt and still feel they and 
their parents never had the protection or "special treatment" 
given to minorities although they were equally exploited. Frank 
refers to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and its impact on Italians: 
Instead of being passed over in favor of 
northern Europeans, southern and eastern 
Europeans suddenly found themselves 
being passed over in favor of Mexicans, 
blacks and Indians. 'Before,' Paul Palermo 
said, 'we were just lousy wops.' Now they 
had magically become coequal with the 
Anglos. 'There were a 
lot of hard feelings,' 
according to Joe Genova (ibid). 
Like Hispanics, Italian immigrants were segregated 
residentially as well as in the workplace, and Pueblo also had 
several nationality-based Catholic churches. There was, 
however, interaction between Hispanics and Italians. IAW 
historian John Williams writes, 
Italians were slightly better off than their 
Mexican-American neighbors, but both 
groups tended to be relegated to the 
sweatiest, lowest paying, or most dangerous 
jobs. They also shared the worst 
neighborhoods. Mt. Carmel church held 
masses in Spanish as well as Italian and 
English, and when its members began their 
postwar moves to the suburbs, a 
mixed 
Italian-Mexican parish church, St. Joseph's, 
was established on the edge of the Mesa 
54 
above a 
ravine settlement called Salt 
Creek...a squatter's barrio on CF&1 land. 
Pious Mexican-American women adopted 
Italian religious practices, such as the 
tavolata or St. Joseph's Table tradition of 
the Sicilians, while men from both ethnic 
groups frequented some of the same 
Bessemer bars. Thus in blue-collar 
Pueblo 
... the two communities have a 
good 
deal of interaction (1992:206) 
The interaction, however, has not always been positive 
nor extensive. A 
priest said Italians and Hispanics only 
recently began to intermingle at fund-raisers at Saint Joseph's 
Church. When asked about a 
Hispanic woman in an area east 
of Pueblo who had prepared a 
Saint Joseph's table, a 
Sicilian 
woman said she baked bread for the event, but she did not 
attend the table "because they are not our people." 
Stephenson (1978) and Blea (1980) found ethnic 
residential areas when they conducted their research. Blea 
states while Chicanos and a 
few Blacks dominated Bessemer, 
many elderly Italians and Slovenians still lived in the area even 
though they had achieved more upward mobility than Chicanos 
and Blacks and many of their younger members have moved 
out (ibid:100). Near Bessemer, Blea identified Bojohn town, to 
the east, with a 
high concentration of Slavic people, and to the 
southwest was Chango (Monkey) Town where Mexican 
Americans lived (ibid:29). 
55 
i 
In the course of my research, an Italian-Slovenian 
woman mentioned a 
reunion for Italians and Slovenians from 
the Elm Street area of Bessemer. I 
asked, "Aren't there 
Hispanic families here too?" "No," she responded, surprised 
and obviously uncomfortable with the question. A 
Hispanic 
man in his forties said he had Italian friends in school and in 
sports, but parents discouraged their children from dating kids 
from the other ethnic group. An Anglo woman stated there has 
always been "friction" between Italians and Hispanics in 
Pueblo because Italians were able to gain greater political and 
economic power. Part of this, she said, was due to the annual 
Columbus Day Banquet organized by Italians. (Because the 
holiday falls during the intense campaigning which precedes 
the November elections, Colorado politicians have regularly 
attended the banquet, resulting in the appearance that Italian 
Puebloans wield much political power.) Tension between the 
two groups grew in the 1960's, she thought, when the 
"outrageous" behavior of Chicano activists angered Italians. 
While there is tension between Italians and Hispanics 
as a 
whole, there is great variation in the relationships between 
individuals. I 
met three Italians who learned Spanish before 
English, an Italian man with a 
Hispanic wife, an Italian woman 
with close Hispanic friends and a 
Hispanic god-daughter, many

Hispanic and Italian women who work together in Catholic 
organizations, and Italians who participate in the Hispanic 
Saint Joseph's table. Thus, it is hard to generalize about the 
relationships between Hispanics and Italians because there is 
a 
such wide range of personal experiences and sentiments. 
In the Hispanic recreation of the Sicilian tradition some 
of the complexities in and the range of relationships between 
Pueblo's Hispanic and Italian communities are manifested 
symbolically and verbally. Similarities and differences between 
the two groups emerge in the contexts of three broad 
categories: religion, economics and ethnicity. In the following 
pages, I 
examine these social and cultural contexts, beginning 
with folk religious expression, the area in which Hispanics and 
Italians are most similar. 
57 
"SAINT JOSEPH SPEAKS SPANISH TOO:" 
MEDITERRANEAN FOLK CATHOLICISM IN COLORADO 
Intra-cultural, commercial and political exchange has 
been common in Europe, including the Italic Peninsula (today 
Italy) and the Iberian Peninsula (Spain and Portugal), for 
centuries. In their quest to expand their empire, Romans 
colonized the Iberian Peninsula and other European areas. 
After the fall of the Roman Empire and the establishment of 
Christianity, the Roman Catholic Church and rulers in the 
Iberian and Italic peninsulas remained connected, especially in 
Sicily where Spanish monarchs ruled for four hundred years 
(Finley, Mack Smith and Duggan 1987:7). 
The period of Spanish domination in Sicily includes the 
years in which Christopher Columbus sailed across the Atlantic 
Ocean for Queen Catherine and King Ferdinand of Spain to 
expand their empire. Spanish and Italian clergymen who came 
to the Americas with Spanish colonists continued this cultural 
exchange in New Spain into this century (Bohme 1975; Rolle 
1968; and Sorrentino, no date). They introduced into the 
region religious customs which are still practiced today, often 
having incorporated the practices of the area's indigenous 
groups to produce many local variations. 
58 
The ancestors of many Puebloans involved in the Saint 
Joseph's table came from Lucca Sicula, a 
small town in Sicily 
which lies northwest of the ancient Greek coastal city of 
Agrigento. The Greeks were some of Sicily's first colonizers 
and Agrigento was an important religious center for Magna 
Grecia. Situated in the center of the Mediterranean Sea, Sicily 
had bustling ports frequented by European, Asian and African 
vessels. Many peoples sought to rule the economically, 
politically and strategically valuable island. Sicily was 
controlled by Greeks, Byzantines, Arabs, Romans, Normans, 
Germans, French, and Spaniards before it became part of the 
modern Italian state, which emerged in 1861. 
Previous to 1861 and for several years after the Italian 
nation was unified, the inhabitants of the Italic peninsula, like 
so many European countries, identified with local political 
entities, such as kingdoms, city-states, feudal estates or 
villages. Many Italians who migrated to the United States after 
1861 continued to identify with these local units. In the 
literature on early Italian immigrants there is much discussion 
about campanilismo, or a 
local instead of a 
national 
identification. At the center of Italian cities, villages and 
neighborhoods there is usually a 
church with a 
bell tower, or 
campanile. In the twentieth century, Italian immigrants, like 
59 
R
n
q
n
n
Ia
11 
earlier Spanish colonists and priests, brought to the United 
States, including Colorado, Mediterranean religious practices. 
Their devotional expressions were so different from those of 
the American Catholic Church's ruling Irish hierarchy that 
Italians were often relegated to church basements and 
clergymen wrote on the "Italian problem" (Orsi 1985; Cortes 
1974; Bohme 1958). 
In Pueblo several people, including two priests, 
remarked on the similar religious customs of Hispanics and 
Italians. Shared practices include making promises to and 
engaging in ritual exchanges with saints; the belief in the 
existence of personal relationships between saint and devotee 
and communication between the two; home altars dedicated to 
saints to whom one is devoted; a 
special fondness for the Holy 
Family and Saint Anthony; observances on saints' days; and a 
complex of patron saints which ranges from the personal to the 
national level. The Saint Joseph's table involves many of 
these practices. 
Our Lady of Guadalupe, the manifestation of Mary 
(Jesus' mother and Joseph's wife) as a 
Mexican Indian, is the 
Catholic patroness of Mexico and the Americas. In 1555, New 
Spain adopted Joseph as their male patron saint (Metropolitan 
Museum of Art, 1990:372). Both figures are associated with 
60 
the poor and humble, and Although Guadalupe dominates in 
terms of devotion and ethnic identification, devotion to Joseph 
is common in Mexico and the American Southwest. 10 
In her study of Bessemer, a 
Chicano barrio in Pueblo, 
Irene Blea writes, 
Urbanization and increased contact with the 
dominant Anglo culture have eroded 
traditional Mexican American religious 
practices. The mixture of Spanish and 
Indian society, however, is still evident 
throughout the Southwest in practices 
commonly known as folk religion and folk 
medicine. To a 
limited extent they are still 
present in the city and county of Pueblo 
(1980:172). 
Traditional Hispanic religious practices are a 
source of 
devotional expressions at Saint Anthony's Church, and 
elements of the Saint Joseph's tradition mesh well with many 
Hispanic customs. One characteristic of the Mediterranean 
religious complex is devotion to the Holy Family (Jesus, Mary 
and Joseph). As Quaggiotto points out, "Joseph appears to be 
the only Catholic saint whose presence automatically implies 
10 An interesting example of this devotion is provided by 
Jorge Mora, a 
16-year-old Puebloan who survived brain cancer 
(Espinosa: 1992). To celebrate a 
year of good health, he 
hosted a 
Halloween party for children with life-threatening 
ailments, and he dressed in costume as Saint Joseph.

the (holy) family" (1988:288). One expression of this devotion 
is, according to Hispanic altar makers, having Maria or Jose as 
a 
first name, or naming a 
child Jesus (the latter naming 
practice, they say, is now discouraged). 
Another custom shared by Hispanic and Italian 
Puebloans is the placement of sacred images in the home, 
often on an altar. The priest at Saint Anthony's sees many 
images of Jesus, Mary and Joseph, singularly or as part of the 
Holy Family, in Hispanic homes. Researchers for the IAW 
project found similar images in the houses of Italian 
Puebloans. Many Hispanics and Italians are also fond of Saint 
Anthony of Padua, an Italian saint who is patron of lost things, 
trivial appeals, women desiring husbands, and of infertile 
women wishing to bear children. The latter two patronages 
pertain to the importance of the family and Joseph, remember, 
is patron of the family. Like Joseph, Anthony is also patron of 
the poor, has the lily as a 
symbol, and is usually depicted 
holding the Infant Jesus. 
Thus, many Hispanic and Italian Americans practice an 
identifiable form of Mediterranean Catholicism, notwithstanding 
.variations which developed locally in Spain, Italy, Mexico and 
the United States. These religious practices, I 
believe, 
62 
provided the cultural base which made possible the Hispanic 
adoption of the Saint Joseph's tradition. 
The importance to Hispanics of Lent and Easter, the 
season in which Saint Joseph's Day occurs, also facilitated the 
tradition's ethnic transference, I 
believe. Some men at Saint 
Anthony's are members of a 
religious fraternal organization 
called the Penitentes. During Lent they conduct rituals 
associated with the -Passion of Christ in an area outside of 
Pueblo and in other places in southern Colorado and northern 
New Mexico, but not at the parish itself. Sicilian and Hispanic 
Puebloans do connect Saint Joseph's Day with Easter through 
the proximity of their occurrence and by placing Easter candies 
and decorations on the altar. They also put plates of sprouted 
wheat on the tables to symbolize new life. Easter, as noted, is 
the ultimate symbol of new life in Christianity. The lily is both a 
symbol of Easter and of Saint Joseph, and the flower is 
included on Saint Joseph tables. 
I 
asked a 
Hispanic altar giver if she thought the 
congregation accepted the Sicilian tradition so well because of 
its occurrence during Lent and near Easter. She said maybe. 
When I 
asked the priest, he said he thinks they like the 
tradition because it is a 
"fiesta." A 
nun who had worked at the 
parish, he added, forbade popular devotional expressions, 
63 
d 
d 
such as posadas. Now, however, parishioners participate in 
Pueblo's annual public Christmas posada. The posada is the 
reenactment of Joseph and Mary's search for an inn in 
Bethlehem, where on their third stop, they were granted 
lodging in a 
stable which became the birthplace of their son 
Jesus. Interestingly, this drama is performed in some versions 
of the Sicilian Saint Joseph's table (but not by Sicilian 
Puebloans) in which people who portray Mary and Joseph 
knock on three doors in one house, or at three different 
houses, or three times at one door in one house, and are 
invited to enter only upon the third knock. 
At Saint Anthony's Church a 
revival of a 
folk religious 
practice called matachin dancing has also occurred. In this 
performance, which originates from Taos, New Mexico (the 
ancestral home of some parishioners), matachines reenact the 
conversion of the Aztecs to Christianity by Spanish priests. 
Dancers perform in devotion to Our Lady of Guadalupe, 
traditionally in the winter after December 12, which is the Feast 
Day of Our Lady of Guadalupe. While a 
group of altar makers 
were talking in the kitchen on a 
Saint Joseph's Day, one 
woman said, "Why don't we do something for Guadalupe? We 
could have mariachis come in, and put roses all around..." 
Another woman interrupted her "That's the bishop's baby." 
64 
Observances for the Feast Day of Our Lady of Guadalupe are 
held at Pueblo's Cathedral, which is seat of the diocese. The 
woman, however, had begun to list Hispanic traditions which 
could be used to celebrate Guadalupe's feast day. 
Couldn't they, I 
wondered, also use Hispanic traditions 
to celebrate Joseph's feast day? Was it easier to do so for 
Guadalupe because she is closely tied to Hispanics? Or are 
the expressive forms involved in the Sicilian tradition so 
familiar that it is not necessary to incorporate markedly 
Hispanic customs? Is it just easier to adopt and/or adapt a 
ready-made tradition? Especially when it meshes so well with 
your own customs, and when Sicilians openly invite other 
ethnic groups to adopt it? 
The first question was at least partially answered in 
1994, when I 
went to see both church tables. At Holy Trinity, 
altar makers had altered the stylisitic presentation of the table 
quite drastically from previous years. One altar giver had lead 
an effort to decorate the table in a 
"Southwest" motif. This 
came about when, because of the death of its owner, they did 
not have access to the statue of Joseph which they had used 
previously. In its place, they brought a 
statue of Joseph from 
the church. This statue was a 
much larger, more modern and 
physically squarer image of Joseph wearing an olive green 
65 
P 
Q 
0 
cloak and a 
brown tunic. Altar givers concurred this statue was 
a 
more masculine portrayal of Joseph, and they wanted a 
table 
with decorations compatible with its masculinity. They 
surrounded Saint Joseph with striped, colorful Mexican 
blankets, plain earthenware, brightly colored pottery, and 
sunflowers and daffodils. As in previous years the food was 
predominantly Sicilian and Italian, however. 
This departure from the stylistic norm "took some 
convincing," and visitors had mixed reactions. All agreed the 
table was beautiful, but some people thought the Southwestern 
motif was inappropriate. One man liked the predominance of 
yellow, but not the new motif. 
If they wanted to change it, he 
said, at least they could have used "Italian colors, red, green, 
black. 
The Hispanic altar makers did not like the change 
either. I 
had visited Holy Trinity first, and then asked four 
women at Saint Anthony's Church if they had seen the altar. 
When I 
told there were Mexican blankets and pottery on the 
table, they quickly and unanimously expressed surprise. One 
woman said, "No, that's for Guadalupe, not Joseph." Another 
said, "There shouldn't be one nationality (represented)--Joseph 
is for everyone. Maybe Italian would have been okay, though." 
Another said, "Why make him so Mexican? There aren't even 
66 
many Hispanics at the parish." They said they would never put 
Mexican blankets on their Saint Joseph's table. 
We have seen how the Hispanic adoption of the Sicilian 
ritual reflects the Mediterranean religious heritage shared by 
Pueblo's Hispanic and Italian communities. The comments of 
participants at Saint Joseph's tables reveal how a 
folk religious 
tradition can also become a 
vehicle for political statements. 
The most salient political messages which emerge from the 
Hispanic recreation of the Saint Joseph's table concern 
economics and ethnicity. In the next sections, I 
discuss how 
these two intimately related issues emerge in the performance 
of a 
Sicilian tradition by the Hispanic parish.

"THEY DON'T HAVE ANYTHING WE DON'T HAVE:" 
POVERTY AND PRIDE IN AN ADOPTED TRADITION 
Issues of wealth and poverty are, as mentioned, integral 
to the tradition. Their most obvious manifestation is the 
conspicuous displays of food dedicated to Joseph, a 
humble 
carpenter who is the patron saint of the poor. This apparent 
contradiction has been noted by scholars as well as the 
Hispanic altar makers in Pueblo. Tension between wealth and 
poverty emerges symbolically and in the discourse of Hispanic, 
Sicilian and other altar givers. 
Toschi describes tables in Sicily at which wealthy altar 
givers invite the poor to portray the Holy Family and give them 
three servings of every dish in a 
plentiful multi-course meal 
and food to take home (1963:279-280). Quaggiotto discusses 
the tradition in a 
rural Sicily where people who portray the Holy 
Family must be poorer than the family hosting the table 
(1988:60-119). However, migration to northern Italy and other 
European countries has increased incomes and caused the 
erosion of economic (if not social) classes. This results in the 
increasing inability to find people willing to portray saints, 
which would mark them with a 
low status. Field found a 
similar 
situation in a 
hill town south near Palermo, Sicily (1990:393). 
68 
Among Sicilian communities in central Texas, social and 
economic tension in the ritual occurs along class distinctions 
based on occupation: farmers versus merchants (Turner and 
Seriff 1993:91). In Pueblo, such distinctions occur along ethnic 
lines in the Hispanic recreation of the Sicilian tradition. 
Although Italian Puebloans formerly had a 
low social and 
economic status, they have become so affluent that some 
Hispanics refer to them as "Anglos," a 
term here stripped of its 
cultural meaning to connote only status. In general, Italians do 
have higher economic levels than Hispanics, especially 
compared to parishioners at Saint Anthony's Church. 
Although the census data on Italians is not recorded in 
the same detailed way as it is for Hispanics and other 
designated minority groups, available statistics indicate a 
marked disparity in the groups' economic levels. The City of 
Pueblo 1992 Data Book states Pueblo (population 98,640) is 
40% Hispanic (meaning Hispanics, Mexicans and other 
Latinos), and 32.5% of Hispanics live in poverty, with a 
poverty 
rate of one-in-three compared to one-in-five for the total 
population (Vest 1992:6). William Veitch, a 
school 
administrator in Pueblo, says that "Unfortunately in this city, 
there is a 
strong overlap between being low-income and being 
Hispanic" (Roper 1992:1). 
69 
In the 1990 United States census, 7,698 people, or 
7.8% of Pueblo's population, voluntarily listed their sole or first 
ancestry as Italian. 11 Based on the median family income 
(MFI) of city tracts (the only unit of measure for Italians which 
was available) in which these Italians live, 58.4% of Italian 
Puebloans reside in tracts where the MFI ranges from $25,393 
to $54,508. In comparison, the average MFI (as measured by 
family, not tracts) for the city of Pueblo is $24,997, which is 
less than the low end of the range for the tracts where the 
majority of Italians live. For Hispanics the MFI (by family) is 
$18,718. The count of Italians who live in tracts where the MFI 
is at or below the Hispanic MFI of $18,718 is 18%, and 77.4% 
of the Italians reside in areas where the MFI is above the MFI 
for Hispanics. Although the measures used are not the same, 
they do indicate a 
clear disparity. 12 
The tract in which Saint Anthony's Church is located is 
even poorer than the average $18,718 Hispanic MFI. Karen L. 
Vigil cites United States census figures which indicate the 
11 Of ancestries voluntarily recorded by first and sole 
ancestry, the four largest groups in Pueblo are Germans 
(
I 9%), Irish (13%), English (11 %) and Italians (7.8%). 
A 
few tracts which are divided between the city of Pueblo 
and areas outside of city limits are not included in these 
percentages. Therefore, they total 95.4% instead of 100%. 
70 
neighborhood is 68.2% Hispanic and "low income, with the 
median family income estimated at $15,238, compared to an 
average of $25,000 for the city" (1992:2a). Vigil writes, "bluffs 
and railroad tracks that separate" the neighborhood 
do more than create a 
physical distinction. 
They draw a 
demarcation line between a 
few streets that make up the small middle-
class area above the much larger area that 
seems like a 
village unto itself (ibid). 
A 
real estate agent who is a 
retired teacher who taught in the 
neighborhood called the area a 
"backwater." When I 
asked 
what he meant, he said, "It's its own community." 
Vigil interviewed Don Vest, statistician for the City of 
Pueblo, who says the neighborhood's population 
has declined in the past decade from 2001 
counted in the 1980 census to 1699 in the 
1990 count. Boarded-up buildings stand as 
silent sentinels to the trend ... The population 
is younger compared to the city as a 
whole. 
About one-third of the people are under 
18 
... and two- thirds Hispanic and about 28% 
white 
... Many residents are transient, moving 
in and out of subsidized apartments and 
homes as their incomes dictate... However, 
since there are some multi-generational 
families who have lived there since the 
neighborhood began, there is an underlying 
feeling of stability (ibid).

Vigil also quotes Joanne Dodds, assistant director of the 
Pueblo Library District, who says the area was settled by 
Hispanics in an area prone to flooding by the Arkansas River. 
Dodds said because of the floods, 
people set up low-income, temporary 
housing that became their permanent 
homes. People lived there because land 
was cheap. Then it became a 
neighborhood 
... the area never developed 
into higher quality real estate because of 
the flood risk (ibid). 
Vigil also interviewed the priest and woman who 
introduced the Sicilian tradition to the Hispanic parish. He 
called the neighborhood "a forgotten area." She said, 
We struggled a 
lot to improve our 
neighborhood. I 
think the city has forgotten 
us sometimes, and sometimes we do have 
to go over there and ask for things. 
Sometimes we get them. We really have to 
fight for what we get (ibid). 
When I 
saw her in 1993, 1 
told her I 
had read the article, and 
teased her about being an activist. She said, "We have to be 
or they'll kick us in the---," indicating her derriere.

Some Hispanic altar makers said the lavish Sicilian 
tables are inappropriate for Joseph, while their simpler table is 
a 
more accurate representation of the life of Joseph, a 
humble 
carpenter who is patron of the poor. Yet, Hispanic altar makers 
try to make a 
"bigger table" each year. Sicilians do adhere to 
the tradition's presentation of exaggerated abundance. When I 
visited the 1993 table at Holy Trinity Church, two women were 
looking at a 
photograph of a 
Saint Joseph's table in Sicily 
which was published in Old Ties, New Attachments: Italian-
American Folklife in the West (Taylor and Williams 1991:162). 
Excited to see a 
Sicilian table, they showed it to someone from 
Holy Trinity who, with a 
wave of her hand, dismissed the 
Sicilian table as "primitive." 
At Holy Trinity, Sicilians, other Italians and non-Italians 
familiar with the tradition, usually through marriage to Sicilians, 
provide the cultural and economic capital required to create an 
abundant table which is visually akin to an "authentic table." 
However, it lacks components commonly attributed to a 
"real 
table." It is held at a 
church instead of a 
private home, it is a 
parish event instead of a 
family-based tradition and, not 
dependent on ritual vow and Joseph's intercession in a 
personal matter, it is an annual occurrence. Altar makers also 
eliminate the portrayal of the saints to avoid potential friction, 
73 
feeling they might upset parishioners in the choice of people to 
represent the holy figures. This means the tradition's primary 
ritual, the serving of the meal to the saints, has been omitted. 
Instead, altar givers organize a 
public dinner and donate 
leftover food to their priest and home-bound members of the 
congregation. 
Because Holy Trinity and Saint Anthony churches 
annually sponsor tables, and in some recent years there have 
not been any home tables, it is natural to compare them. Due 
to the economic disparity of their parishioners and 
neighborhoods, the differences are noticeable. While the tract 
in which Saint Anthony's Church is located "is still marked by 
poverty 
... and inferior housing" (Darrow 1992:1), Holy Trinity is, 
according to Vest, in "an affluent tract with many lawyers, 
doctors, teachers and retired CF&I employees" (personal 
communication, July 1993). The tract's MFI is $35,407, which 
is 2.32% times higher than the $15,238 MFI recorded for the 
tract in which Saint Anthony's Church is located. 
In 1991, 1 
went to Holy Trinity twice. On the first visit, I 
saw an Italian woman I 
had met at Saint Anthony's. She said 
to me, "Don't get me wrong, I 
don't want to knock the other 
place, but this is a 
real table." When I 
went again with a 
woman from Saint Anthony's Church, I 
pointed out vegetable 
74 
omelets, fried artichoke stalks, and heaping plates of a 
several 
varieties of Italian cookies as we admired the table. She 
commented on a 
plate of seafood, all of which were absent 
from the table at Saint Anthony's. She noted there were no 
cut-dough, fig-filled pastries in the shape of religious symbols, 
something the Hispanic table did have. 
When we returned to Saint Anthony's Church, she 
announced to the altar makers, "They don't have anything we 
don't have." How could she say that? She would have to 
ignore the food mentioned above and differences in the variety 
and quantity of food. She would have to equate live lilies and 
large bouquets of roses and other fresh flowers with artificial 
flowers. Also, she would have to ignore fine tableware, such 
as china plates and crystal wine decanters. Earlier that same 
day another Hispanic woman had criticized Holy Trinity for 
using linens and crystal. 
I 
asked friends who accompanied me to both tables in 
1993 to compare them. One Sicilian-Anglo woman and her 
family prepare Saint Joseph's tables in Trinidad, Colorado, a 
town 80 miles south of Pueblo with large Hispanic and Italian 
populations. She noted the table at Holy Trinity was larger and 
more elaborate with more traditional foods, and a 
wider variety 
of breads, cookies and sweets. She said it reminded her of 
75 
tables prepared by her family. My other friend said the Holy 
Trinity table was richer in color, texture and levels, that it was 
"more alive," it suggested "largesse" and "generosity," and it 
seemed like a 
"feast that was ready to eat" versus "artifacts" on 
display at the Hispanic table. Both thought the table at Holy 
Trinity was more elaborate, larger, better lit, had fresher 
vegetables and fruits, and that it was a 
more affluent parish. 
Even though it was a 
large table in a 
small room, and Saint 
Anthony's had a 
large table in a 
large room, they thought the 
differences were obvious. 
About a 
month later, I 
showed slides of the tables to two 
other friends, both folklorists who had heard of the tradition. 
They used the words colorful, elaborate and diverse to 
describe the table at Holy Trinity, and restrained for the 
Hispanic table. When I 
showed photographs of the Hispanic 
table to a 
folklorist who studies the tradition in Texas, she 
commented on its simplicity. When I 
showed the photos to a 
Sicilian altar maker in Pueblo, she described it as "sparse." 
Her daughter said maybe they wanted it that way so you could 
see everything. This family actually uses a 
relatively small 
recessed area in their dining room for their Saint Joseph's 
altar. Despite the small area, however, the food is abundantly 
76 
displayed giving the prescribed appearance of exaggerated 
plenitude. 
In contrast, at Saint Anthony's Church, food items are 
displayed in more modest amounts on ceramic and plastic 
plates covered with paper doilies, and there are fewer types of 
foods in general, and especially less Italian foods. Although it 
does contain many of the tradition's basic elements and it is 
admired by visitors, including some Italians, the Hispanic table 
is simpler because of the church's low economic base. Equally 
important, the altar makers are not part of the Sicilian social 
and cultural network whose members expend a 
great amount 
of time, energy and money to create a 
table. The Hispanic 
altar makers do have a 
collection of articles written about the 
tradition, but they do not have the involvement of the Sicilian 
tradition bearers who possess the extensive knowledge and 
experience necessary to prepare "a real table" with all of its 
numerous details. 
Although the Hispanic altar givers try to prepare a 
fuller 
table each year by adding food and other items whenever 
possible, their aim is not to replicate a 
traditional Sicilian table, 
about which they have collected recipes and publications. 
Instead, their primary goals are to "spread the word about 
Joseph," and create something special for their community. 
77 
n
They are proud of their accomplishment on both accounts. 
They warmly and proudly greet visitors and explain the 
tradition to them. When the priest said other clergymen had 
teased him about adopting a 
Sicilian tradition and possible 
reprisals from Sicilians (a stereotypical reference to the Mafia), 
an altar giver responded, "Well, tell them we are in the Library 
of Congress!" When I 
related negative reactions by Sicilians 
to the Hispanics Saint Joseph's table, I 
was invited to sit at the 
main table. This invitation, I 
believe, was also to thank me for 
positively promoting the tradition and the church. 
In my initial conversation with the woman who first 
borrowed the tradition and introduced it to the parish, she said 
the church was "99% Hispanic, and poor." She showed me 
photos of much smaller tables they had when they first began 
having the event at the church. She proudly said the tables 
have grown a 
little each year. In the early years, she made a 
cross out of pink paper flowers for the table instead of using an 
image of Joseph. In 1992, she proudly pointed out a 
new lace 
cloth over the yellow fabric used to cover the table, and a 
bowl 
of saffron rice that had received positive comments from a 
visiting Italian. 
The priest at Saint Anthony's Church believes one 
reason the congregation adopted the tradition so readily is they 
78 
can identify with Joseph. In his 1992 sermon on Saint 
Joseph's Day, he compared Joseph, who was a 
carpenter, to 
the Hispanic santeros of southern Colorado and northern New 
Mexico who carve images of saints. The year before in his 
Saint Joseph's Day sermon, he compared the parishioners to 
Joseph, a 
hard worker who struggled to provide for his family 
and to protect them as all good fathers do. Joseph did not give 
up during hard times, neither should they, he said, knowing 
that many in his parish were experiencing difficulties. 
When I 
spoke to him the next day, he reiterated the 
themes of poverty, hard work and persistence. His 
parishioners can relate to Joseph, he said, because they are 
poor but they work hard to provide for their families, which they 
put above all else. Joseph, remember, is patron of the family. 
The priest also said people in the congregation have faced 
many trying situations, as did Joseph. He added that they 
could not afford a 
fancy table, even if they wanted one, 
because they don't have large enough houses, or china and 
crystal. Anyway, he said, their simpler table is a 
truer 
reflection of the life of Joseph. 
asked a 
Hispanic woman, who is actively involved in 
Pueblo's cultural activities and is familiar with Saint Anthony's 
Church, to read and comment on this report. She believes

Hispanics may have adopted the tradition so easily because, 
"We really buy into poverty--poverty has been our cross. 
Humility through penance and sacrifice--this is our penitential 
rite preserved for hundreds of years on the frontier and 
ingrained in our character." (Poverty, humility and sacrifice are 
characteristics of Joseph.) She added that Hispanics have a 
tradition of offering a 
guest the best they have, no matter how 
humble it may be, and the Saint Joseph's table provided 
another form with which they could express that custom. 
Thus, issues of poverty encoded in the Sicilian tradition 
have acquired a 
unique variation in Pueblo, due to specific 
local economic and social prestige issues. In her study of a 
Chicano barrio in 1980, Blea said traditional Hispanic religious 
practices in Pueblo have been channeled into institutions 
rooted in the dominant society (1980:172). Could something 
similar be occurring with the Hispanic adoption of the Sicilian 
Saint Joseph's table? Based on economic statistics, more 
Italians than Hispanics seem to have become part of Pueblo's 
dominant society. 
Further, is there an intent, conscious or unconscious, to 
participate in a 
tradition which has garnered some social 
prestige and public acclaim? The Pueblo Chieftain usually 
announces Saint Joseph's tables in its "Religion" or "Briefs" 
80 
section and occasionally does a 
story on the tradition. Some 
altar givers also contact local television stations and there has 
been at least one broadcast of a 
home table. Additional 
attention has come from historians, folklorists, writers and 
photographers who have documented table events in Pueblo. 
Within the Catholic community, tables events are listed in 
church bulletins and the diocese paper, and their occurrence 
circulates by word of mouth. 
Other related political questions arise. When irate 
Italians chastised and insulted the Hispanic altar makers for 
stealing the tradition, did it make them more determined to 
continue to do so? To prepare a 
bigger and fancier table each 
year? 
Although I 
believe the ritual's adoption by Hispanics 
was motivated by and is performed primarily as a 
form of 
religious devotion, the annual Hispanic event has acquired 
political connotations related to economics and ethnicity , 
and 
which are a 
result of the historical and contemporary 
relationships between the two communities. In the next 
section, I 
examine the ethnic issues which emerge via the 
Hispanic Saint Joseph's table events.

"WHO DOESN'T EAT CORNED BEEF AND CABBAGE ON 
SAINT PATRICK'S DAY?:" 
THE CROSS-ETHNIC TRANSFERENCE 
OF A 
SICILIAN TRADITION 
To reiterate, the Saint Joseph's altar tradition is a 
highly 
ethnically-keyed event in which the Sicilian community's ethnic 
identity and heritage is repeatedly emphasized (Turner and 
Seriff 1993:91). Despite this strong ethnic affiliation, Sicilian 
Puebloans promote the tradition's adoption by other groups in 
the name of the patron of the Universal Church. When asked, 
Sicilians and other Italians expressed approval of the 
tradition's Hispanic version. I 
sensed ambivalent feelings, 
however, because Italians knew of tables prepared by 
Sicilians, other Italians, a 
Slovenian woman married to a 
Sicilian, and at Holy Trinity Church, and seemingly every table 
in town, except the Hispanic event. 
When I 
asked directly about the Hispanic table, a 
few 
people did say they had heard about a 
Hispanic church which 
had a 
Saint Joseph's table, but did not know what church. 
Because altar givers at Saint Anthony's Church had 
announced their table in the paper for several years and just 
the year before it was featured in an article along with Sicilian 
82 
I 
tables (Porter 1989:1 C), I 
was surprised that more Italians did 
not know about the Hispanic table. One man couldn't 
remember the church's name even though he had given them 
some food one year. A 
Sicilian woman said she did not know 
of a 
Hispanic church which had a 
table, but she had once 
baked special breads for a 
Saint Joseph's table prepared by a 
Hispanic woman at her home. She did not attend the event, 
however, because she said Hispanics "are not our people." 
In 1991, 1 
interviewed a 
Calabrian woman who had 
learned the table tradition from her Sicilian in-laws. She and 
her husband are close friends with their Hispanic neighbors, 
although he was at first reluctant to accept Hispanics as 
friends. She also said a 
generation earlier it had taken her 
Calabrian family a 
while to accept her marriage to a 
Sicilian. I 
asked why she thought Hispanics would adopt a 
Sicilian 
tradition to honor Joseph. "Because they really have the faith," 
she responded. "I know that", I 
said, "but why do you think 
they would use a 
Sicilian tradition to express their devotion?" 
With a 
shrug of her shoulders she said, "Who doesn't eat 
corned beef and cabbage on Saint Patrick's Day?" 
The day before, March 17, was Saint Patrick's Day and 
I, in fact, had eaten corned beef and cabbage at a 
restaurant in 
Colorado Springs before I 
visited a 
museum exhibit and lecture

about the santero tradition of wood carvers from southern 
Colorado and northern New Mexico. I 
wondered, am I 
reading 
too much into this situation? The Calabrian woman implied it 
was natural to borrow traditions. Maybe she is right. We live 
in a 
culturally diverse society in which it is common to adopt 
traditions from many cultures. Even I 
had an Irish meal on 
Saint Patrick's Day, and I 
did not at all have fond memories of 
the holiday. 
Dependent on individual experiences, reactions to the 
Hispanic recreation of the Sicilian home altar tradition varied 
greatly. Indeed, acting in the true spirit of the patron of the 
Universal Church, some Sicilians and other Italians applaud 
the altar makers at Saint Anthony's Church. Some Italians visit 
the table, make donations of food and money every year, offer 
friendly advice on foods which the table "needs to have," 
attend the evening mass given before the meal, and enjoy the 
pot luck dinner. 
In 1992, however, the publication in The Pueblo 
Chieftain of an interview about my research at Saint Anthony's 
Church (Porter 1992:61-2) elicited some negative responses to 
the Hispanic table and my research. In the interview, I 
suggested a 
shared Mediterranean religious heritage and the 
similar experiences of Hispanics and Italians in Pueblo's labor 
84 
history accounted for the Hispanic adoption of the tradition. 
Some Sicilians were upset because the paper had focused on 
the Hispanic table when it is a 
Sicilian tradition. Also, others 
were angry because the photo which accompanied the article 
showed a 
Hispanic woman with breads and pastries made by a 
Sicilian whose work had not been credited. The journalist 
claimed she pulled the photo from their archives and did not 
know the Hispanic woman's ethnicity. 
When I 
visited a 
Sicilian home table, one woman, so 
upset that she was shaking, said, "You never say this is a 
Sicilian tradition. You don't even know this is Sicilian." In fact, 
the article's first sentence reads, 
Anthropologist Paula Manini is researching 
St. Joseph's Day tables and paying special 
attention to Pueblo's interpretation of the 
Sicilian custom which is observed on March 
19 (Porter 1992:61). 
I 
told the woman I 
did know it was a 
Sicilian tradition, and gave 
her a 
copy of Colorado History News which had a 
front page 
article I 
had written entitled "Saint Joseph's Day: A 
Sicilian 
Tradition in Southern Colorado" (1992:1). Seeming somewhat 
appeased, she asked for several copies of the paper. 
When I 
explained to another upset woman that the 
Hispanic altar givers had adopted the tradition because of their 
85 
devotion to Joseph, she countered, "They have Guadalupe, 
they don't need Joseph." She added, "We don't try and steal 
Cinco de Mayo," and "Traditions shouldn't mix." "Don't you 
ever eat corned beef and cabbage on Saint Patrick's Day?" I 
asked. "No," she tersely replied. These conversations took 
place near the altar dedicated to Joseph, patron of charity, the 
poor and the Universal Church. At first I 
felt sorry for upsetting 
them, but then wondered, as I 
looked at the image of Joseph 
on the altar, what would he think? 
Once again, I 
had encountered racism while doing 
fieldwork, which always poses a 
dilemma for me because, as 
an anthropologist, I 
am not supposed to judge people, just 
record data. When asked to be interviewed about my research 
on the Hispanic Saint Joseph's table, I 
did intuit it would anger 
some Italians because of the ambivalent feelings I 
sensed 
about the tradition's adoption by Hispanics. While listening to 
the two women who negatively responded to the published 
interview, however, a 
selfish thought entered my mind: "This is 
great for my report!" Until then the only evidence I 
had about 
disapproval of the Hispanic adoption of the Sicilian tradition, 
was second-hand information that Italians had anonymously 
complained that "Mexicans had stolen their tradition." 
86 
asked people why they thought Italians would react 
negatively to the tradition's Hispanic adoption. A 
woman who 
had also adopted the tradition, which belongs to her husband's 
Sicilian heritage, said "some people are just like that." She 
added that Italian resentment towards Hispanics had 
developed because Civil Rights legislation gave them 
advantages Italians never had. A 
friend who prepares Saint 
Joseph's tables in Trinidad, Colorado, said the angry Sicilians 
"must do the tables for themselves, not Joseph." A 
Sicilian 
man and his Calabrian wife who prepare Saint Joseph's tables 
told me they had received phone calls from Italians who 
wanted them to complain to The Pueblo Chieftain about the 
article. They told the callers the paper has always given their 
tables fair coverage, and that anyone can adopt the tradition. 
However, in the course of my fieldwork some Italians did 
say the tradition does not receive the coverage it deserves in 
The Pueblo Chieftain. Publicity is important to the altar makers 
not only for recognition but because they also strive to invite as 
many people as possible to their table, feeling an obligation to 
share the good fortune bestowed upon them by Joseph. The 
Pueblo Chieftain does list the tables in the weekly section on 
local secular and religious events but only occasionally

features table events in its "Lifestyle" section. To my 
knowledge, it has never been covered on the front page. 
When I 
asked a 
journalist why the paper does not cover 
Saint Joseph's Day events every year, she said although altar 
makers often call, Saint Joseph's tables are "not news." My 
study of the Hispanic event, however, was a 
different approach 
to the tradition and was, therefore, "news." I 
understood the 
frustration and dissatisfaction of Italians about the attitude that 
the Saint Joseph's table tradition was "not news." There are 
other religious and secular ethnic events in Pueblo which must 
be considered newsworthy because they are covered annually, 
often on the front page and sometimes with more than one 
story or photo in one or more issues, by The Pueblo Chieftain: 
the Christmas posada, the annual Fiesta (a celebration for 
Cinco de Mayo), Columbus Day, Juneteenth, Saint Patrick's 
Day. Why not Saint Joseph's Day? 
To conclude this discussion on ethnicity, in several 
aspects the Saint Joseph's tables in Pueblo have ethnically 
based implications. The tables are strongly rooted in the 
Sicilian community, yet Sicilians have invited other ethnic 
groups to adopt the tradition. This, however, has caused 
some friction towards Hispanics who have done just that. 
88 
n 
However, reactions by Sicilians and other Italians to the 
Hispanic tables varied according to personal experiences. 
Celebrations for the Columbus Quincentary provided another 
twist to the situation. 
Italians seemed to overlook, or not be 
aware of, that Columbus sailed for Spain, not Italy, and that at 
the time of his voyages, Sicily was ruled by Spain. Add to this 
the Mediterranean folk religious practices shared by Italians 
and Hispanics, and it is apparent that the two ethnic groups 
have in common some history and cultural traditions. In my 
opinion, this common ground proved fertile for the transference 
of the Saint Jospeh's table tradition from Sicilians to Hispanics.

CONCLUSION 
The transference of the Sicilian tradition to Hispanics 
offers a 
complex example of interethnic relations in the 
American Southwest. In the Hispanic Saint Joseph's tables 
ethnicity, religion and economics are interconnected, and 
implicit and explicit verbal and symbolic messages about 
Pueblo's Hispanic and Sicilian communities are expressed. I 
examined the tradition both in its broad social and historical 
contexts and through the discourse which emerged in its actual 
performance. 
To better understand the Hispanic recreation of the 
Sicilian tradition, I 
attempted to answer four questions. When 
they have their own rich repertoire of devotional customs, why 
do Hispanics honor Joseph with a 
Sicilian tradition? How are 
messages about wealth and poverty conveyed through the 
event? How do Sicilian Puebloans and others feel about the 
Hispanic adoption? How does the Hispanic recreation of the 
Sicilian tradition reflect the broader context of social 
relationships between the two ethnic groups in Pueblo? 
I 
believe the Hispanic altar makers initially adopted and 
continue to prepare Saint Joseph's tables because of their 
devotion to Joseph, who is a 
popular saint in Hispanic culture. 
Because Hispanics and Sicilians share many religious customs 
90 
which derive from a 
common Mediterranean Catholic folk 
heritage, the Saint Joseph's table tradition is a 
familiar 
devotional form for Hispanics, which meshes well with many of 
their folk religious practices. In its actual performance, 
however, the tradition has acquired political as well as religious 
meaning. 
Issues of wealth and poverty are encoded in the 
tradition but have an additional local interpretation due to 
economic differences between Hispanic and Italian Puebloans. 
Because Hispanic altar makers do not possess the economic 
nor cultural capital needed to prepare an "authentic table," 
differences between the ethnic groups are manifested in the 
Hispanic table's relatively sparse presentation and in the 
discourse of participants at table events. This disparity is 
especially apparent in tables held at Holy Trinity and Saint 
Anthony's Church because of the churches' very different 
economic bases. 
There is a 
range of reactions to the Hispanic table by 
Sicilians and others familiar with the tradition because issues 
of ethnicity are personal and vary according to individual 
experiences and beliefs. Some Sicilians and other Italians 
actively support the Hispanic altar makers and participate in 
their table events, and while others believe anyone can adopt

the tradition, they do not participate in the Hispanic event. Still 
others are angry at the tradition's adoptions by Hispanics. 
Clearly, for these people the Hispanic adoption of the Saint 
Joseph's table had violated "a group pride based on the 
integrity of a 
cultural heritage" (Tricarico 1983:83). 
The broader relationships between Pueblo's Hispanic 
and Italian communities are manifested in the adoption of the 
Sicilian tradition in three ways. First, similarities between their 
folk religious customs are salient in the Hispanic Saint 
Joseph's table. Second, the Hispanic event reflects 
differences between the two groups' current economic 
statuses. Finally, the Hispanic recreation of the Sicilian ritual 
highlights unique personal and local ethnic dynamics because 
Hispanics have adopted a 
tradition which is highly ethnically 
keyed for Sicilians. From the blurring of ethnic divisions 
produced by the Hispanic recreation of the Sicilian home altar 
tradition emerges a 
range of personal emotions and opinions. 
These varied reactions mirror the range of relationships and 
experiences which have occurred between Pueblo's Hispanic 
and Italian communities as a 
whole. 
In 1993, 1 
noticed shamrock cookies on the Saint 
Joseph's table at Holy Trinity Church, and cupcakes decorated 
92 
with shamrocks on the table at Saint Anthony's. I 
remembered 
the Sicilian woman who said that "traditions shouldn't mix," and 
that she had never eaten corned beef and cabbage on Saint 
Patrick's Day. I 
wondered if she would approve of this symbol 
of Irish ethnicity on a 
Saint Joseph's table? Would she react 
like a 
woman in Dallas who, I 
was told, got upset when she 
saw a 
shamrock cake on a 
Saint Joseph's table? When I 
commented on the cupcakes to a 
Hispanic altar maker, she 
said, "Don't you know? Patrick and Joseph are first cousins." I 
grinned. My first cousins Pat and Joe have an Italian father 
and Irish mother.

APPENDIX 
Prompted by the dearth of materials on Italian 
Americans in the western states, Alan Jabbour, director of the 
American Folklife Center, at the Library of Congress, 
developed the Columbus Quincentenary project Italian-
Americans in the West (IAW). Directed by David Taylor, the 
project included field and archival research, the collection of 
artifacts, a 
traveling exhibit and the book Old Ties, New 
Attachments: Italian-American Folklife in the West (1992). 
Edited by Taylor and John Williams, IAW project's historian, 
the publication contains a 
variety of articles by the folklorists 
who worked in the six field locations: Gilroy and San Pedro, 
California; Walla Walla, Washington, Paradise Valley, Nevada; 
Carbon County, Utah; and Pueblo, Colorado. 
I 
collected most of the data presented in this essay as a 
folklorist for the project in Pueblo in 1990-91. 1 
also used 
information gathered by some of the other IAW researchers, 
especially John Williams, Russell Frank and Paola Tavarelli. 
Douglas De Natale and Bea Roeder, a 
Colorado state 
folklorist, also worked in Pueblo, with photographers Ken Light 
and Myron Wood. Although the project's focus was Italian 
Americans, the fieldworkers discovered many ethnic groups 
94 
played important roles in Pueblo's development and continue 
to have a 
salient presence in the city. They also found racism, 
in-group and out-group labeling, joking, church festivals, 
secular celebrations, camaraderie, and other forms of behavior 
based on ethnicity constitute a 
strong social dynamic in 
Pueblo. I 
became particularly interested in the Hispanic 
adoption of the Sicilian home altar tradition. 
I 
conducted archival and field research several times 
between 1990-94, engaging in formal interviews and informal 
conversations with people familiar with the tradition as altar 
makers or visitors to table events. I 
always recorded data in 
field notes, sometimes more diligently than at other times, and I 
photographed the festivities. In 1990, 1 
conducted taped 
interviews with nineteen individuals involved with the Saint 
Joseph's altar tradition, including Sicilians, non-Sicilian 
Italians, and a 
Slovenian, a 
Czech and a 
Hispanic woman. I 
also spoke less formally with approximately twenty other 
people involved in or familiar with the tradition. 
Intrigued by the Hispanic adoption of the Saint Joseph's 
table, I 
returned to Pueblo to attend table events at Saint 
Anthony's Church, the Hispanic parish, in 1991. That same 
year, I 
also visited a 
table at Holy Trinity Church, which has 
many Sicilians and other Italians in the parish along with other

European Americans, including a 
few Hispanics. Both 
churches annually host a 
Saint Joseph's table. In 1992, 1 
went 
to Saint Anthony's Church and three home tables on Saint 
Joseph's Day. Home altars were given by a 
Sicilian family; a 
Sicilian man and his Calabrian wife (whose parents had 
learned the tradition from Sicilian neighbors in 1941); and by a 
family largely comprised of Sicilians. In 1993 and 1994, 1 
visited the church tables, the only Saint Joseph's tables held 
those years. 
I 
spoke to the primary altar maker at Saint Anthony's 
Church several times. I 
interviewed her for the IAW project in 
1990 and spoke to her over the phone a 
few times before a 
visit in March 1991. In March 1991, 1 
saw her on the Feast 
Day of Saint Joseph at the parish hall, and the day before 
when the hall was open for people to bring items for the altar. I 
briefly met with her in May 1991 and in March 1993. 1 
also 
spent several hours informally conversing with other altar 
makers at Saint Anthony's Church in 1991-94 at table events, 
and visited the priest who heads Saint Anthony's Church 
several times. 
Accompanied by two friends in 1993, 1 
visited the tables 
at Holy Trinity and Saint Anthony's Church (there were no 
home tables that year). I 
briefly explained the tradition to one 
96 
1 
friend who had seen some photographs of tables. With us was 
a 
woman whose family often hosts a 
church table in Trinidad, 
Colorado, which is located eighty miles south of Pueblo and, 
like Pueblo, has Hispanic and Italian communities. I 
asked the 
two women and, later, three folklorists to evaluate and 
compare the tables. 
At table events, I 
acted as a 
participant, admiring the 
tables, chatting with participants, observing strangers and 
people I 
knew, and listening to their conversations. At Saint 
Anthony's Church in 1992, 1 
was invited to sit at the table 
reserved for people who put on the event in appreciation of my 
positive promotion of the tradition and specifically of its 
adoption by the parish in an interview with me which was 
published in the local paper that year. 
For my research, I 
used direct and indirect questioning 
but found that most statements about difficult or sensitive 
issues arose on their own, without inquiries from me. This 
included information about phone calls from Sicilians angered 
that "Mexicans had stolen their tradition," and comparisons 
between the abundant Sicilian tables and simpler Hispanic 
event. One fruitful research tool was an article written by Mary 
Jean Porter about my research on the Hispanic table in the 
March 17, 1992 issue of The Pueblo Chieftain. The article

elicited reactions which ranged from supportive to neutral to 
irate by Sicilians and others regarding the tradition's Hispanic 
adoption. Some responses confirmed suspicions I 
had about 
an unspoken dislike of Hispanics by some Sicilians. This was 
balanced, however, by Sicilians and other Italians who 
supported the adoption, and visited and contributed to the 
Hispanic event. 
To get a 
sense of the general relationships between 
Pueblo's Hispanic and Italian communities, I 
spoke with current 
and past residents of Pueblo who were Anglo, Jewish, 
Slovenian and Hispanic about their opinions and experiences 
concerning the relationships between Hispanics and Italians.

enrolled as a 
part-time student at Fort Lewis College. After 
four years of part-time study, and working at ski areas in 
Durango and Stowe, Vermont, she enrolled at the University of 
Colorado at Boulder in 1978. In 1983, she graduated with 
distinction with a 
Bachelor of Arts degree, majoring in 
Anthropology and Italian. She also worked as a 
student 
assistant at the University of Colorado Museum. In 1987, 
Manini entered the graduate program in Anthropology at the
