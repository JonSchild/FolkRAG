If you'll just turn the page,  you'll find a warm,  impressive,  exciting
 
story of our Workshop on Negro Folk Music, held in October of 1965 at
 
Highlander Center.
 
We of the Highlander Board are especially proud of one paragraph from
 
this front-page article in "The Southern Patriot."
 As you will read,
 
Alan Lomax,  America's great authority on folk music,  expressed his joy
 
over the involvement of young people from the freedom movement in ef-
forts to preserve old folk forms.
 Then the story goes on to say:
 
The folk revival actually dates back to the late 1950's
 
when Guy Carawan,  California-reared folk singer with fami-
ly roots in the South,  joined the staff of the Highlander
 
Folk School in Monteagle,  Tennessee.
 From there, he took
 
adaptations of old spirituals--including "We Shall Overcome"--
to the communities where the students began to demonstrate in
 
1960.
 
This is but another example of the seminal effect which Highlander has
 
had on the civil rights movement in the South.
 
Another important aspect of Highlander's influence is pointed out in
 
this article .
... the fact that music--so long a part of the Highlander
 
tradition--serves as an effective bridge between Negro and white.
 At
 
Highlander we haven't needed bridges; there everybody has always been
 
together,  in work and play.
 But it's good to know that we have helped
 
create a bridge to bring people together throughout the South.
 
In all this,  you -- our good friends -- have supplied the bone and sinew
 
to keep us going.
 I hope you will enjoy reading about this Highlander
 
Folk Music Workshop,  and I should be pleased to receive your comments.

s very strong.  His
 
words g
o s
omething l
ike this:
 
"

Carlton Reese, d
irector of t
he B i
rmingham Choir understands "why we hear the
 
s
lave s

he c
hildrens' game s

ea d
 
and t
he m
aster t
hought he could t

hought we could d

nothing about i

id, even as children, with t
his music.  And it i
s our own,
 
it i

The d

ecomes s
harp, personal.  Tom Paxton tells of t

n t
he
 
white t
radition t
hat had t
o be r
ejected before he c

he s

light g
irl of
 
perhaps 90 pounds who s
pent two months in a r
otted j

angry.  Her eyes f
lashing s

of this m

Andy Young, a s

rives home a key point with an example,
 
"We a

Je found that o

hey d

At t
he c
oncert t
hat n

he Sea Island S

ere t
he only g

a standing ovation.  Many of the people who had c

Can ton Reese, d

O
r  of the greatest assets of American culture i
s the music that h
as b
een
 
;
treated i
n the South.  Outgrowths of this r
oot music developed by the Negroes
 
from this geographical area have become established as a u
niversal  l
anquaqe.
 
However, because this music c
learly s
hows t
ies to and i
nfluences from Africa!,
 
oriains, many of the people who can continue to crea
te thi s mus
ic h
ave
 come
 to  
feel that i
t i
s a h
inderance to their progress.  They are still r
eac
t
i ng  to 
the undermining i
nfluences of t
h e techniques of s
lavery, which strip a h
uman
 
h
:
;ina of a
ll n
ational and personal  i
dentity.
 
He;-etofore, talented musicians h
ave been `
discovered" a
nd taken out of their
 
,
mmunities to become performing stars on the commercial stage.  Even the
 
p
eople who h
ave done r
esearch i
nto grass-roots music h
ave done so for t
he
 
6
,
2refit of others (
posterity, the National Archives, h
istorians, folklorists,
 
,
i
re.).  The producing communities h
ave benefited l
ittle, neither d
irectly, i
.e.,
 
;
•
v appreciably r
aising their standards of l
iving, nor by the greater yet more
 
s
ubtle advantage of i
nstilling i
n the community a l
ove of a
nd appreciation for
 
t
he music a
nd pride i
n a
n i
dentity w i
th th e pas
t and  its  d
irect i
nfluence on
 
this creativity.
 
After Guy Carawan spent several years on John's I
sland, S
. C
., a
nd after
 
f
estivals i
n Atlanta a
nd E
dwards, M
ississippi, that addressed themselves to
 
these problems,  i
t was d
iscovered that there were several other people across
 
the South w
ho were w
illing to g
ive t
ime to projects that would focus the
 
attention o
' t
he community i
tself u
pon i
ts own cultural heritage a
nd traditions.
 
This conference was called i
n r
esponse to their needs: to h
ear the story of
 
what had been done by Guy Carawan, by Jerome Smith of New Orleans, and by
 
W
illie Peacock, Sam B
lock, and W
illie McGee from M
ississippi; and to make p
lans
 
to n
r
lt a folk music revival program i
nto action a Southwide b
asis.  The meetinq
 
was organized by Bernice Reagan and Guy Carawan; M
iles Horton provided the
 
p
lace; r
epresentatives were i
nvited from the f
ield from Georgia, A
labama,
 
e
nd _
ouisiana; and Dr. W
illis James and A
lan Lomax were called u
pon to enrich
 
-
s
he meting w

 I
ndigenous s
ingers were brought
 
�o s
hare their genuine style w
ith participants.  Newport sent R
alph R
inzler
 
a
nd Julius L
ester to evaluate the meeting.  Present at the meeting, which took
 
p
lace the weekend of October 1
, i
n addition to those a
lready mentioned, were

ingers, Ed Young, and others.
 
W
illie Peacock, S
am B

ong
 
hooed for a chance to work w
ith grassroots culture.  The meetings at
 
E
cwards, M

ith L

nd others, crystalized their i
ntentions.
 
A
fter setting down a p
lan and a budget, they obtained some f
inancial s
upport
 
=
rom H
ighlander from royalties on the song "We Shall Overcome,  which Seeger,
 
Carawan, and others had agreed should be devoted to Negro culture.  The
 
M
ississippi trio i
mmediately set about organizing a f
irst grassroots folk song
 
and music festival  i
n M
ilestone, M
ississippi, a community where i
ndependant
 
Negro l
andowners had r
etained a pride i
n their own tradition.  This f
estival,
 
which took p
lace on August 6
, 1
965, brought together s
ingers, o
ld-time dancers,
 
ar.1 other performers of the area.  An exhibition of Negro and A
frican art,
 
a
long w
ith l
ectures on African culture, deepened the meaning of the f
estival.
 
An o
ld-time s
lavery cookout engineered by the l
adies i
n the community, where
 
ash cakes, b
lack-eyed peas, greens, and h
am hocks were eaten w
ith the f
ingers,
 
a
s i
n s
lavery t
imes, helped to put aside s
uperficial d
ifferences and brinq
 
everybody to the same basic l
evel.  At the end of the three-day music r
evival,
 
t
he people of M
ilestone asked that the festival be made an annual affair.
 
E
ncouraged by the actual and the spiritual s
uccess of this occasion,  i
n which
 
a submerged community h
ad become v
itally of i
ts own creative powers, the
 
M
ississippi trio l
ooked around f
or ways to broaden i
ts work.  When Peacock
 
was asked why he chose to work i
n the delta i
nstead of i
n the h
ills, he s
aid,
 
'
'
1 thought of myself as a song doctor, and I
 thought I
 ought to go where the
 
songs were s
ick."
 
Jerome Smith, from New Orleans, brought p
ictures and told of the Mardi Gras
 
which f
lourishes among the Negroes i
n New Orleans.  Totally u
ninvaded by whites
 
or commercialism, i
t remains one of the strongest bonds i
n the community.  The
 
men belong to tribes which now number about twelve; the songs and d
ances
 
reenact a t
ime when there was hostility and k
illing among the tribes which now
 
i
s r
eenacted only i
n t
he pagentry of the d
ance.  The i
ntricacy of design a
nd
 
detail
 could not have been described.  The p
ictures of these costumes were
 
breathtaking.  Headpieces four or f
ive feet across, feathers and stones
 
embroidered from head to foot i
n designs that speak of both African and
 
American I
ndian i
nfluence.  These costumes are sewed by the me n, as only t
he
 
men are i
n the r
itual d
ances.  They represent the best that the i
ndividual  i
s
 
able to make, each man being proud and jealous of the designs and special
 
things that he i
s able to add to the costume.  They sew on the costumes a

year I
ona.  The f
athers teach t
heir sons.  The f
amilies make tremendous
 
s
acrifices so that money can be spent on materials for the costumes, which
 
cost be -ween twenty-five a
nd several hundred dollars.  These costumes are worn
 
on Mardi Gras day and never again; they are destroyed on the following d
ay,
 
w

STATEMENT OF I
NTENT!
 
Reso�
lved: that this conference be a springboard for a cultural revival in the
 
South at the community or grassroots l
evel; that we will deal f
irst with
 
Ne;
,ro culture and music, since this seems to be in the greatest immediate danger
 
o
 -
'
 being l
ost to posterity, and to have the greatest immediate advantage,
 
t
"
zat of enriching the newly a
zure and modern Negro with a sense of identity
 
;
n his own and American culture.
 
Negroes have created a world-wide musical l
anguage in ragtime, ,
jazz, blues,
 
oosre,
,, rock and roll, etc., but often they are ashamed to accept the richer
 
root music and ,
folk tradition out of which all this emerged.  It will be our
 
a
;temrt, though community gatherings and other projects, to counteract this
 
'
eel nq of shame and this mis-education, and thereby to renew the interest
 
0,
-
'the Negro community in its own artistic output, to the end that much
.
 
'
,eautifuZ music be saved .
from oblivion, and that t
he habits which produced
 
it stay alive, so that more songs will grow in the future.  The following
 
are some of the guide l
ines upon which we h
.ave agreed.
-
(
1)  In d
eveZoping our projects we must face t
he fact that the Negro has been
 
brainwas
,�ed, turned against his cultural heritage because of white-dominated
 
teackina in the schools and in churches, and because of the distorted waY in
 
which h
is music has been presented
, by the mass communications industry.
 
(
2
 we ,
^
g
ust do a serious and l
oving research into the basic f
orms of expression
 
o' the T
egro people--into the sources of the spiritual, the epic sermons.
 
,
he wo�°K songs, the blues, and the dance music which express the particular
 
c
ensus of this people, which record their j
oys and their sufferings and which
 
mus% ?e the basis f
or the future growth of a genuine Negro culture.
 
(
,
,  G
l
e intend to encourage the Negro community to come alive in its own
 
rit c
r
ud on its own t
erms.  f
I
e stand firmly opposed to those who hold that
 
1*causa the Negroes are winning the C
ivil Rights fight that they must be assimi-
l
ated into the sterile ways of Wain Street America.  Political and economic
 
p
rogress does not have to mean conformity.  A rich and beau tifu l
 America  
s
,
zouZd be as culturally varied as possible.

Carawan feels that i

responsibility.  This Christmas, therefore, B

organizer, w

ocal
 
t
p,ent, thus cutting down expenses, and trying to i
nvolve more sectors of

earned that p

the attempt w

I
I. OTHER PROGRAM ACTIVITIES AND IDEAS
 
(
So many program suggestions were made during the conference that it is
 
impossible to mention them all here, but a few specific plans should be
 
:
rut on record as a guide to future work.)
 
(
1) Dr. Willis James record:
 I
t was felt that Dr. James'
 
l
ecture on the A
fro-American music s
hould be recorded so that i
t could
 
be used to break down the stereotypes that h
ave made many people f
eel that
 
A
fro-American music was l
ow-down
,, primitive, and derived from Western
 
Europe.  Ralph R
inzler w
ill r
eturn to Atlanta w
ithin a few weeks and
 
produce a f
inished tape w
ith Dr. James.  This tape w
ill be r
eleased by
 
Folkways.  The committee and the Newport Foundation w
ill try to get this
 
recording w
idely d
istributed to schools, colleges, r
adio stations, and
 
community centers.
 I
t i
s felt that the l
ecture i
tself w
ill answer i
n a
 
very effective way the people who feel that Negro music i
s not the equal
 
c
f any other musical tradition i
n the world.
 
(
2)  Congregational singing in the church:  A
lan L
omax pointed
 
out that the most i
mportant home for Negro choral style was i
n the Negro
 
church service i
tself, but that, because of new f
ashions a
ffecting the order
 
of worship, the p
lace formerly devoted to group s
inging was being taken by
 
choir performances and other non-Negro music.  The church was attempting to
 
"modernize" i
tself by bringing i
n organs, p
ianos, written music, hymn books,
 
trained choirs, a
nd m
icrophones--aZZ perfectly good things in their place--
and, w
ithout r
eally i
ntending i
t, was thus e
liminating the o
ld choral style
 
of the spiritual, s
imply by g
iving this activity no p
lace i
n church l
ife.
 
For this reason, the g
i
lder people i
n the church were effectively excluded
 
from expression i
n music, by means of which, formerly, congregations of
 
Southern "
t,�
groes were able to unite their voices i
n complex and beautiful
 
harmony, i perfec'
. t
ire, w
