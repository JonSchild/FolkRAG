LET'S TALK ABOUT AESTHETICS
 6/95
 
Maine Arts Sponsors Association
 
Thank you so much.  Do you know,  the very first official
 
visit  I made for the Folk Arts Program at the National
 
Endowment  for the Arts was to Maine,  and I still remember how
 
thrilled I was when Denny Wilson called me up way back in
 
1977 and actually invited me  
to pay his  state a visit.  I was
 
so  flattered.
 
Well,  I had a great trip,  and you Maine folks taught me
 
an awful  lot.  And now you' ve been kind enough to ask me back
 
againthis time to talk about aesthetics.  I think that's
 
marvellous.  Down in Washington,  something's exploding every
 
ten minutes;  up in Maine people are still self-confident
 
enough to want to take some time during a busy important
 
conference to try to think about why they' re doing what
 
they' re doing.  I really think you're terrific.
 
But  I' m not a big-time philosopher,  and this paper was
 
probably mis-named.  What  I am going to try to do is to tell
 
you a little bit about how I acquired my own aesthetic
 
philosophy -
-
 as somebody once put  it,  how I came by what
 
I
' ve got.  I hope this won't  seem too self-centered;  I' ve  just
 
found that,  although everybody's  story is different,  hearing
 
another one often helps trigger one's own important
 
recollections.
 
Now when  I was a little girl,  more than seventy years
 
ago,  my family moved from central to east Texas,  out in the
 
country.  It's now a Dallas  suburb,  but then it was pretty far
 
away from anything,  so my mother decided to teach me at home.
 
She taught me Latin and piano and medieval history and lots
 
of unusual things,  but she also taught me day-to-day things.
 
She taught me how to sew,  for example.  I remember sitting
 
with her rag bag that was  full of scraps of material from all
 
the clothes mother had made for us,  and sort of folding doll
 
clothes out of them.
 
But then  I had to learn how to do it right.  My mother
 
was a great believer in doing things right.  She gave me a
 
2
 
Latin motto  (
she gave all of us  children different mottos)
 
Mine was  "Faciendo ediscimus
 facere" which means  "By doing
 
learn to do" and she would tell me  "By reading you learn
 
to read",  "by dancing you learn to dance",  "by sewing you
 
learn to sew".  So I learned how to work her old foot-treadle
 
Singer sewing machine.  She would give me the  front page of
 
the Dallas Morning News after she and father had finished
 
with it,  and -
-
 with the machine unthreaded-- I would sew up
 
and down the newsprint columns and around the photographs
 
until  I learned just how to sew a straight  line and turn a
 
neat corner.
 
And then  I had to learn how to embroider -
-
 because
 
that's what all the little girls did in my part of the
 
country -
-
 at  least little Anglo girls  like me.  Because every
 
November,  my mother and I would go to the dime store downtown
 
and I would get to pick out the presents  I was going to make
 
for Christmas,  secretly,  when nobody was  looking.  In those
 
days you could buy dresser scarves or table napkins or bridge
 
table covers that had designs  stencilled on them with blue
 
dots.  And embroidering was to cover those blue dots with
 
French knots and lazy daisies and outline stitches in
 
different  colors  so that  it would turn out to be a special
 
present that you yourself had a hand in.
 
So after  I had picked out the things  I wanted to
 
embroider for my sister or my mother or my aunts,  I would go
 
to the embroidery thread counter and pick out the colors.
 
That was the best part.  There was always white embroidery
 
thread there,  I remember,  and lots of pastels -
-
 pale green,
 
pink,  lavender,  yellow,  pale blue,  and sometimes black and
 
sometimes  red and sometimes bright green.  I agonized.  I never
 
had enough money for all the colors  I wanted.  One year I
 
remember coming home with red and black and light green and
 
pink and lavender,  and my older sister said,  "Honey,  you
 
don't want to use that red and black.  They won't blend.  You
 
want  it to blend and be pretty."
 And I thought  it might be
 
3
 
pretty,  but  I tried it,  and it wasn't.  It didn't blend,  and I
 
had to pick it all out and start again.
 
Now when  I remember what was  in our ragbag -
-
 scraps
 
from my dresses and from the shirts and blouses mother made
 
for the others,  and her own dresses and aprons and good
 
pieces  from father's old business shirts -
-
 those pieces of
 
cloth weren't  scarlet or magenta or bright green or black.
 
They were  lavender and pink and light blue,  and they were
 
solid colors or small prints.  I guess you could say we were
 
conservative.
 
And every once  in a while my mother would load the
 
ragbag up into the car and we would go to see the quilt  lady
 
who lived about two miles  from us.  Now this was during the
 
depression and everybody did what they knew how to do to make
 
a few cents,  and this  lady really did know how to make
 
quilts.  Mother and she would look over all our scraps,  and
 
she would get out all her patterns she had cut out of the
 
newspapers,  and they would decide which pattern would look
 
best with the material we had.  The idea was,  you see,  not to
 
have to buy material;  nobody could afford that in those days.
 
But this  lady could take all our old bits and pieces and make
 
absolutely beautiful quilts out of them.  Mother always  said
 
she was a real artist at her work.
 
So all the quilts on our beds that we  slept under every
 
night turned out to be blendy.  They were made out of the
 
clothes we wore and the colors we had chosen and according to
 
the aesthetic principles we had learned -
-
 neat corners,
 
straight  lines,  balanced curves,  precise workmanship,
 
unemphasized dividing lines,  subtle color gradations.  It's
 
actually a wonderful aesthetic system -
-
 around the world it
 
has produced beautiful effects from 18th century Italian
 
paintings to British flower gardens to Chinese porcelains to
 
east Texas quilts,
 
But  let us consider other color palettes that are  in use
 
around the world.  American  Indians,  particularly in the
 
southwest,  often emphasize clear primary colors -
-
 blue,  red,
 
4
 
yellow -
-
 each of which can represent a different direction -
 
-
 east,  north,  south,  west,  up,  down.
 They point a way and
 
make distinctions between elements rather than shading things
 
together.  African-American quilters often emphasize movement
 
and energy,  with brilliant  color-soaked contrasts that almost
 
vibrate to the eye:  magenta and lime green and sulphur yellow
 
and lots of black to set  it all off.  The colorful visual
 
playfulness of many Mexican-American traditions depends on
 
the use of shocking pink and scarlet and peacock blues.
 
But nobody ever told me  I was  learning an aesthetic
 
system;  nobody ever thought about  it that way at all -
-
 I was
 
just  learning how to do things the right way.  And I have to
 
confess to you that at home all these years  later  I have a
 
long labored over project -
-
 a wool baby blanket to be made
 
of woven squares.  And I laugh at myself sometimes when I look
 
at  it because with the whole world of color and gaiety to
 
choose from,  the colors  I picked out are white and pale green
 
and pale yellow,  because  I just thought they would work up so
 
pretty.
 
And there  is one other thing I need to say about my
 
early aesthetic training.  One's aesthetic educational
 
experience includes both what you do learn and what you don't
 
learn as well.  For instance,  I was not taught even the
 
rudiments of basket making.  You could have locked me in the
 
tower all night with a bale of straw to weave,  like the
 
princess  in the  fairy tale,  and you would have had to chop my
 
head off the next morning because  I wouldn't have even begun.
 
Basket making was not part of the particular artistic
 
tradition in which I,  a little East Texas Anglo girl,  was
 
being brought up,  unlike some of my neighbors.  Some people in
 
my part of the country might even have  said I was  culturally
 
deprived.  Even though I could play the piano -
-
 why,  the poor
 
little thing,  she couldn't even make a basket bottom!
 
So far I have been trying to show rather than define -
-
demonstrating for you how the traditional
folk arts
 
quietly emerge  from the aesthetic patterns expressive of
 
5
 
particular groups  in our populaton,  the ones that are
 
sometimes  called "folk groups".  And what are  folk groups -
-
just bunches of people who define themselves as themselves by
 
virtue of sharing one or more common factors -
-
 sometimes the
 
same ethnicity,  other times the same occupation,  or language
 
or location or religion,  perhaps.  All of us have belonged to
 
one or more such groups during our lives.  And every person
 
who is a member of such a group is exposed to  (or you might
 
say "learns")  its particular aesthetic pattern and uses  it as
 
a lifelong point of aesthetic reference.
 
It  is astonishing how deep these early experiences  lie
 
and how potent they are.
 Some years ago I was attending a
 
concert that presented a sampling of the musicians scheduled
 
to appear at a large multi-ethnic festival in Los Angeles.  It
 
was quite a show.  There were scores of musical performances
 
from all around the world;  kilted Scots bagpipers marched
 
down the center aisle;  African drummers thundered from the
 
stage,  mariachi orchestras blazed and trumpeted,  gospel
 
choirs filled the enormous hall with sonorities.  I was  in my
 
element,  making knowledgeable remarks to my companions,
 
(
showing off,  frankly),  thrilling to each extraordinary set
 
of sounds.  The whole thing went on for hours,  each
 
performance more special than the last,  until almost at the
 
weary end three  slightly bedraggled looking men carrying a
 
banjo,  a guitar and a string bass  shambled out on the stage,
 
fussed around rather unprofessionally for a minute or two and
 
then struck up --"Red Wing".
 
"Red Wing!" The corniest of all  songs,  the one you never
 
know whether you should sing in public or not,  it's text  is
 
so ultimately silly.  But they played "Red Wing",  and my heart
 
absolutely melted.  The most extraordinary sense of total
 
well-being came over me,  I was comforted,  I was secure,  I was
 
home,  that was j
ny song.  And you know what -
-
 I was
 
embarrassed about  it!  I had to admit to myself that  if  I had
 
seen a copy of the program ahead of time,  I would have said,
 
for pity's  sake,let's  leave out Red Wing!  I had moved so far
 
6
 
away from my East Texas roots,  I had forgotten where they
 
lay.  But my roots hadn't  forgotten.  There they were,  ready to
 
remind me who I am and where  I come from.
 
So that,  ultimately,  is what this thing called multi-
culturalism that  so many people worry over is really about.
 
It's about making sure that everybody on the one hand gets to
 
check back to his own roots every once  in a while  for comfort
 
and dignity and presence and on the other hand gets a chance
 
to revel  in the glories of the inventiveness that other
 
cultures -
-
 whether occupational,  religious,  ethnic or local
 
-
-
 have to share with us.  You' re not  stuck with your early
 
aesthetic principles -
-
 you build upon them and add to them
 
,\
 
your whole life  long i f you' re lucky.
 
It all reminds me of my dear old friend Dewey Balfa,  the
 
great Cajun fiddler from Lafayette,  Louisiana.  You Maine
 
folks know who the Cajuns are -
-
 descendants of the Nova
 
Scotians who were exiled to the Louisiana swamps  in 1755.
 
Their cousins  still live in northern Maine.  Now ever since  I
 
knew Dewey,  when I asked him what he would most  like to be
 
doing,  he used to say,  "Oh,  what  I really want to do is to
 
teach the children in the  schools here how Cajun music works
 
and how interesting Cajun songs are,  and show them how
 
beautiful their own culture  is".  And then he would tell me
 
all over again how he used to get whippings  for speaking
 
Cajun  (which is  simply one of many French dialects)  in the
 
schoolyard when he was a little boy,  and how he would read in
 
the paper that Cajun music sounded like the yowling of cats.
 
And his eyes would fill with tears.
 
Now many people  from France,  from Canada,  many
 
anthropologists and folklorists and even a few of those
 
wicked arts bureaucrats  joined in a major campaign some
 
twenty years ago not  just to have Cajun music presented in
 
the  schools of Louisiana but to have the language and the
 
arts and the aesthetic system of Cajun culture included in
  
the base-line materials that Cajun children were given to
 
7
 
learn and study in the schools that their Cajun parents were
 
supporting with their Cajun tax money.
 
And after a year or so of this,  it all began to happen.
 
And one day when I called Dewey on the long-distance
 
telephone to ask how things were going,  he said,  "Oh,  it's
 
just wonderful.  They' re letting me bring my Cajun band into
 
the music classes  in all the schools around here,  and I can
 
show how each instrument plays a rhythm that's different to
 
the others and how the different voices of the instruments
 
sing high and low,  and the children  just love it,  and the
 
music teachers  love it too.  .
 .
 But  I have to say I' m
 
beginning to worry about  something."
 
And I said,  "Mr.  Dewey,  what are you worrying about
 
now?" And he said,  "You know,  I look at these Cajun children
 
these days and I think how they oughtn't  just to learn about
 
Cajun music.  There's  lots of other kinds of music in
 
Louisiana too -
-
 there's  Italian music and music from Spain
 
and there's music from the Caribbean islands and there's  jazz
 
and symphony music,  and our Cajun children ought to have the
 
chance to learn about all of them.  Don't you think so?"
 And
 
I swallowed down twenty years of effort and said,  "Yes,  Mr.
 
Dewey,  you' re right.  That's the next thing we have to start
 
to work on."
 
You see how it works?
 There's a kind of playground
 
justice and sense of order here,  and it's not  just deeply
 
desired,  it's required.  And what we as arts people have to
 
keep doing is  seeing to it that everybody gets their turn,
 
and that nobody gets too terribly much more than their share.
 
And we of the arts world have an additional responsibility
 
to try to help these different aesthetic systems not  just
 
survive but thrive. You see,  almost everybody is secretly
 
just a teensy bit embarrassed by their early traditional
 
learning;  we tend to think of it as a bit childish and
 
certainly out of date and that's why we forget about  it  so
 
fast.  And that's why it's easier to find a University of
 
Maine student who can play excellent Franco-American fiddle
 
8
 
than a real old-timer.  Because the old-timer hasn't ever seen
 
f
l
'-•' '
 
his  stuff on the t. v.  or on the radio,  and his children in
 
sahool haven't ever learned it or even heard it mentioned.
 
It's the  lucky college kid who occasionally wanders in to a
 
college class where he can hear and see the  joyful creations
 
of the whole world,  and he gets to pick and choose among
 
them.
 
And so the old timers often need extra spec l attention
 
from people to help them re-evaluate their abandoned
 
traditions,  their lovely old art  forms,  and to encourage them
 
to present them once again.  But the pinch comes when we of
 
the arts world discover that letting all the aesthetics  in
 
will mean giving up  just a bit of the prime time on the media
 
and in the schools,  time that is typically reserved for
 
popular music  (that makes a lot of people a lot of money),
 
advertising art  (
that does the same),  and classical European
 
art  forms  (that make most people feel truly educated.)  And
 
that  is and will continue to be a really tough battle;  don't
 
ever under-estimate it.
 
For you see,  popular and fine arts try to speak
 
across cultural or geogra.hic boundaries to the largest
 
possible audienc s
 d
 therefore economically quite
 
Profitabl
_
/ their message  is often necessarily diluted
 
so as to speak to more people.  But they do speak the mass
 
language.  Traditional  folk arts,  though.,  speak of and for
 
their particular group,  and so their particular aesthetic
 
styles are particularly distinctive -
-
 and so they don't
 
always  speak the mass  language.  But they often
 rcome to
 
represent their group as a whole.  Think,  for instance,  of
 
Hawaiian hulas,  African American blues,  Pueblo pottery.  There
 
is nothing to prevent,  say,  an Eskimo from learning to do the
 
hula;  however,  should he do so,  he will be an Eskimo doing
 
the Hawaiian hula,  not an Eskimo doing the Eskimo hula -
-
there  is no such thing.
 
I sometimes tell people that  folk arts are the arts that
 
help you know where you are when you get off the airplane,
 
9
 
The airports have pretty much the same architecture,  the
 
books in the booJ
tands are pretty much the same,  the music
 
over the Musak
 pretty much the same.  And if you get a
 
chance to go to a concert
no matter where it  is
you' ve  landed2 
you'll probably hear much the same program,  if
 it's a
 
symphony orchestra gala or a heavy metal big bash.  And,  sadly
 
enough,  that's happening right around the whole world.  I
 
could say the same things about Tokyo,  or Paris,  or Capetown.
 
And if this continues,  as my brother Alan Lomax once
 
wrote  in an unforgettable phrasing -
-
 "If this condition of
 
world-wide cultural grey-out continues,  pretty soon there
 
will be no place in the whole world worth visiting -
-
 and no
 
particular reason to stay home either." Think about that one
 
for a few minutes.  How can we really comprehend that the
 
lovely multi-colored world that we see in the astronauts'
 
photographs can,  unless we care  for it,  become uniformly dun-
colored -
-
 khaki,  desert-sandy,  mousy-brown.  Am I speaking of
 
the physical or the cultural environment? Really,  both.
 
It's all kind of scary,  isn't  it,  and we're
 meeting at
 
such a tough time too,  aren't we? As  I write these words,
 
there is  just no way of telling how the Congress  is going to
 
move.  But no matter how the Washington wars are temporarily
 
resolved,  I do believe that our comfortable  institutional
 
ways of doing things  in the arts world have already changed
 
and will continue to change, k
d as  long as they are,  why not
 
try to change them for the better?
 
So now is a really appropriate time to think carefully
 
about how we look at the world of the arts and what we
 
actually see there,  how wide and inclusive is our vision.
 
Maybe if we turn our heads,  not  far,  just a fraction,  we
 
could see  some things we have been missing.  Maybe we could
 
notice some new ways and some new groups top help us counter
 
the economically and politically driven pressures that are
 
forcing us,  in spite of all resistance,  towards artistic
 
conformity and cultural uniformity. 
10
 
I could make one suggestion -
-
 a bit of extra
 
consideration for your local traditional art  forms could do a
 
lot.  Like individual  fine artists,  the folk cultures  I' ve
 
been talking about generally operate outside the major
 
aesthetic systems.  And so they keep things  lively for
 
everybody,  and -
-
 as  I' ve also been pointing out-- they are
 
essential  for their own in-group morale.
 
I looked up the word "morale"  in my old Websters once,
 
and he says that  it's the mental or emotional condition of
 
confidence,  enthusiasm,  or loyalty with regard to the
 
function or tasks at hand.  Think about that the next time you
 
start a fund-raising drive.  And then think about how some of
 
the great  local artistic traditions of Maine might be
 
seriously included in your next campaigns.  For possibly they
 
might bring with them the  "confidence,  enthusiasm and
 
loyalty" of a whole new bunch of people.
 
Hey,  you' re working in a great  situation in Maine!  The
 
NEA Folk Arts Program itself has already identified three
 
Maine folk artists as national treasures
 and given National
 
Heritage Fellowships to the late Sister Mildred Barker from
 
the Shaker colony at Poland Springs,  and to Simon St Pierre,
 
a brilliant French-Canadian fiddler from Smyrna Mills and
 
just  last year to Mary Mitchell Gabriel,  a superb
 
Passamaquoddy basket maker.y'2
k-
 c
'
 
Maine's got  it all! ,)
fsh,  French,  Native American
 
Br
7 central European and many south-east Asian
 
traditions abound in your cities.  In the rural areas,  the
 
logging,  lumbering and sea-faring regions of Maine have
 
produced a repertoire of stories and ballads that are known
 
all round the world.  When have you heard one lately?
 And you
 
have an absolutely A+ scholarly tradition,  headed by your
 
internationally known folklorist Charles D. (Sandy)  Ives.at
 
the University of Maine in Orono.  In a trip  I made for the
 
Endowment around the Pacific Islands,  I took along a set of
 
helpful publications to leave behind at each island's local
 
cultural agency,  and every one included a copy of "The Tape
 
11
 
Recorded Interview" by Sandy Ives of Orono,  Maine.  It  still
 
pleases me to think about all those lovely island folks
 
sitting under their palm trees trying to work out where to
 
put their mikes according to Sandy Ives'  suggestions.
 
And then there's your very own state Folk Arts
 
Coordinator,
 Kathy Mundell) who has been doing a job for you
 
that  is recognized by her peers  right across the country.  Amd
 
she told me  just  last night that Maine now has a brand new
 
arts organization -
-
 and there are very few like it anywhere
 
in the nation -
-
 the Maine  Indian Basket Makers Alliance -
-
something to be  really proud of.  Maine  is  in awfully good
 
shape,  really.
 
I want to close by telling you  just one more personal
 
story.  I got a presidential medal last year along with seven
 
or eight other arts people and five or six humanities people
 
and we were all sitting on a platform in the White House back
 
yard on a gorgeous afternoon.  I got to sit next to Ray
 
Charles,  and we held hands the whole time -
-
 I think he was a
 
little bit  scared and I know I was.  Anyway,  at the end of the
 
ceremonies President Clinton went up to the microphone and he
 
said some things  I will never forget.
 
He  started off,  as best  I remember it,  "Well,  folks,
 
it's been a wonderful celebration,  but  it's over now and we
 
have to go on back to work.  But before you leave,  I want you
 
to take a last  look at the people sitting up here on this
 
platform and remember that they were all born in ordinary
 
families,  in ordinary houses,  in ordinary cities or towns or
 
out  in the country all across America.  But what happened to
 
them is that  some time in their growing up,  each one of them
 
managed to catch hold of a great  idea,  a subject,  or a
 
principle that was so compelling that they spent the rest of
 
their lives pursuing and exploring it.  And now,  what we have
 
to do is to see to it that all American children -
-
 every one
 
of them -
-
 get a chance to grab their own great idea,  their
 
own exciting subject,  their own enduring principle to build
 
their lives around."
 
12
 
I really have thought about this.  I guess,  in my case,
 
my "big idea" had something to do with the crucial importance
 
of the traditional arts to every traditional community.  It
 
doesn't  seem like all that much.  But wherever I go,  from
 
Maine to Midway Island,  I realize all over again how strong
 
so many of these local art  forms are,  how brilliant and
 
engaging their practitioners,  how ready they are  for new
 
audiences and new ways to open up and enliven their
 
particular part of the world.
 
To help them with their purposes "
" a wonderful work of
 
the hand and the spirit,  all the better because it will never
 
be finished,  all the better because it always involves us in
 
new partnerships and makes us new friends and shows us the
 
world in new ways.  Let us hope that the years to come will
 
herald a new coalition of energies working steadily and
 
positively to help our country delight  in its own varied
 
artistries,  its own extraordinary histories.  We probably
 
don't know at this moment exactly how to do all this--  I know
 
I don't -
-
 but we should remember what my mother always  said
 
-
-
 Faciendo ediscimus  facere -
-
 by doing we  learn to do.  So
 
let us do,  and let us keep on doing again,  and again.  We'll
 
learn.
