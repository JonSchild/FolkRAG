DUNDREARY O'DONNELL, 
Written and sung by W ILLIAM SCANLAN, in SCANLAN S 
CRONIN'S 
original Irish comedy farce, entitled " O'Donnell's Victory." 
Dundreary O'Donnell is my name, 
I'm a 
man of great renown, 
It's just about twinty years ago, 
Since I 
landed in this town; 
An' since that time I 
a 
family raised, 
Which I'm very proud to tell, 
An' in this city iver since, 
Wid me frinds I've had to dwell. 
Cuotics. 
Dundreary O'Donnell is my name, 
An' all the people say, 
I'm the coining man of this great place— 
The rest have had their day. 
As I 
walked wit this mornin'. 
Sure all the people said— 
" 
There goes O'Donnell, the candidate, 
By him we're to be led; 
Arndt! he's the man that'll rule New York, 
An' won't he cut a 
shine— 
Whin he goes over to Washington, 
As a 
Senator so fine!" 
Dundreary O'Donnell, etc. 
Now that the election is over, 
An' the glorious battle is won, 
My kindest thanks I 
offer to those, 
For the work they have done; 
And whin I 
take my sate, my frinds, 
The public thin I'll show— 
That Dundreary O'Donnell is the people's choice. 
Wherever he may go.

Put a 
Headstone O'er Poor Mother's Grave. 
Written by W ILLIAM SCANLAN. 
Oh, Willie, dear Willie, our mother is dead, 
Our mother whom we loved so dear; 
She's sleeping to- night in her cold, cold grave, 
No more will she be with us here. 
How happy we were when by the fireside. 
With mother we'd sit all alone; 
And what stories she'd tell to both you and I, 
'Rut now she has left our dear home. 
CHORUS. 
Yes, mother has gone to heaven above, 
And there's one thing of you I 
would crave; 
As children should do for a 
mother so true— 
Put a 
headstone o'er her beloved grave. 
How often, when sickness kept us in our beds, 
Not a 
friend in the world could we find 
Half so good as our mother, who'd sit by our side, 
And to us be so gentle and kind. 
Yes, morning and night, she'd watch our sick brows, 
Never thinking of rest; 
But now she has left its alone here to weep, 
And gone to the land of the blest. 
Yes, mother has gone, etc.

THE IRISH COACHMEN. 
Written by W ILLIAM SCANLAN, and performed by the famous 
SCANLAN & CRONIN. 
Air—" Irish Regiment.' 
Just cast your eyes upon us, 
We're dressed up in the style, 
We are two nobby coachmen, 
And we're from mild Erin's Isle; 
Arrah! it's many a 
happy day we seen, 
In that Isle so far away, 
And the same we spilt ever since we came 
To swate America. 
When first we landed in New York, 
We wint to Union Square, 
Where we were engaged to drive 
A coach by a 
man named Dare; 
Ile brought us to his residence, 
Which was in Fourteenth Street, 
And the way we dressed and turned out, 
With us nothing could compete. 
CHORUS. 
Then give three hearty cheers, 
For the land of America, 
The same for dear ould Erin's Isle, 
Although she's far away; 
And whin ye meet us in the street, 
Yer hats to us just rise, 
And yell find we're just what ye may call— 
Two noble Irish boys. 
was engaged as footman, 
c.—Ad I 
was engaged to drive, 
And the way we turned out you'd think 
We were the happiest men alive; 
As we'd drive along through Broadway, 
The people all would say— 
" 
There goes two noble Irish boys, 
Oh, ! don't they look gay!" 
Our boots and buttons shining bright, 
Our clothes so nice and clean, 
Such nobby Irish boys, my friends, 
Ne ter before was seen; 
And though we're now in America. 
And every thing is serene, 
We'll ne'er forget the land of our birth— 
That Emerald Isle so green. 
Then give three hearty cheers, etc.

A 
PARTICULAR FRIEND. 
Sung with great success by W ILLIAM SCANLAN. 
Of all blessings on earth many people agree, 
An affectionate friend is the best; 
And there's hardly a 
treasure as far as I 
see, 
That's more likely to be in request. 
As I 
chanced long ago to be caught in a, snare, 
To advise I 
may safely pretend; 
So I 
beg you to choose with particular care, 
When you choose a 
particular friend. 
CHORUS. 
Friendship's a 
jewel both precious and rare, 
And scarce to be found in this world I 
declare, 
So I 
bid you to choose with particular care, 
When you choose a 
particular friend. 
I 
had once art acquaintance—but not to be rash. 
I'll refer to him simply as Jones 
I 
advanced him a 
good many trifles in cash, 
Which of course I 
regarded as loans. 
When I 
mentioned the fact (in a 
twelvemonth or two) 
'Twas without any wish to offend; 
But he said that the shabbiest thing I 
could do, 
Was to dun a 
particular friend. 
Friendship's a 
jewel, etc. 
At the time I 
acknowledge I 
didn't much care, 
For it scenic d 
there was little to fear, 
I 
was courting a 
lady, accomplished and fair, 
Who had nearly ten thousand a 
year. 
But though matters went on in a 
flourishing way, 
They were far from correct in the end; 
I 
was " cut out " by Jones, for Fni sorry to say, 
She preferred my particular friend. 
Friendship's a 
jewel, etc. 
I 
was robbed of my money and robbed of my wife, 
By this very respectable man; 
And to keep up a 
decent position in life, 
Is as much as I 
possibly can. 
Mr. Jones is ungrateful for all that has passed, 
And to know me will scarce condescend, 
I 
was " cut " like a 
pauper on Saturday last, 
When I 
met my " particular friend!" 
Friendship's a 
jewel, etc. 
Sung by W ILLIAM SCANLAN with great success. 
Air—'' Mulcahey's Gone Away." 
Come listen to me one an' all, 
To what I'm goin' to say, 
It's all about a 
neighbor o' mine, 
Who lives across the way; 
He's the owner of a 
big coal cart, 
An' he likewise drives the same, 
An' he got a 
great big billy goat, 
Who's very much to blame. 
CHORUS. 
For whin he'd jump, he'd hit you a 
thump, 
Unless you'd quickly slope ; 
Oh, the terror of the neighborhood— 
Is Gilfillen's big buck goat 
I'll tell you of the damages, 
That he's done all around, 
He wint into Mrs. Higgins' house, 
And her Sunday gaiters found; 
He began to ate, when she gave a 
bawl, 
Oh, I 
tell you there was a 
row, 
He sint her rollin' over the stove— 
She needs no bustle now. 
For whin he'd jump, etc. 
Now it was here this afthernoon, 
He came into my yard, 
While I 
was piantin' flowers, 
And he sthruck me mighty hard; 
10 
He knocked me down, jumped on me, 
An' he ate the tail o' me coat, 
Blue'd glass have no effect at all 
Oxi Gilfillen's big buck goat! 
For whin he'd jump, etc. 
Last Snnday week he ate my shirt, 
He also ap my hat, 
An' he also knocked the shtuffin' 
Out of Mrs. TMaloney's cat; 
I'm goin' to get a 
warrant now, 
(For my back is nearly broke,) 
To have Gilfillen arrested, 
And his son of a 
gun of a 
goat! 
For whin he'd jump, etc.

THE FIVE O'CLOCK 'BUS. 
Words by F. W. GREEN. 
Music by J. H. Youxu, 
Published by E. H. H ARDING, 229 Bowery, N.Y. Price 10 cts, 
My name it is Stokes, and at Putney I 
dwell, 
And on Tower Hill I've a 
warehouse as well; 
I 
am a 
dry- salter in quite a 
large way, 
A very dry salter I 
think I 
may say. 
I 
always am down in the city at nine, 
And unless I 
come home in the evening to dine, 
My dear little wife really makes such a 
fuss, 
So I 
soothe her by catching the Five o'clock ' Bus. 
CHORUS. 
For the five o'clock 'bus, there are thirteen of us, 
And we start from the bank in the five o'clock ' bus. 
For the five o'clock ' bus, there are thirteen of us, 
And we start from the bank in the five o'clock ' bus. 
The five o'clock riders are all city gents, 
Who talk about shares and the new three per cents, 
Each day the same lot of old gentlemen ride, 
And the five o'clock ' bus carries thirteen inside; 
One evening when starting—depict our dismay, 
When our old conductor quite slily did say, 
" 
Would any gent here like a 
lady to nuss? 
For there's one wants to go by the five o'clock ' bus." 
For the five o'clock 'bus, etc. 
The old buffers smiled, and the old buffers frowned, 
And then came some chaff about handing her round, 
For the five o'clock 'bus was so full, don't you see, 
It was plain she must ride on some gentleman's knee: 
The lady was pretty, and young, it was clear,' 
And so we all said, " Come and sit here, my dear! " 
She giggled and blushed, and she might have done wuss, 
For she sat on my knee in the five o'clock 'bus. 
For the five o'clock ' 1.;us, etc. 
I 
chatted and talked to the girl all the way, 
And slily arranged I 
would meet her next day, 
But when I 
alighted and rung at the bet 
I 
found the young woman was waiting as well; 
I 
shook in my shoes with a 
horrible doubt, 
I 
feared she had come there to let it all out, 
But my wife, when she saw us, said, " Very odd, Gus, 
here's our new servant come by the five o'clock 'bus." 
For the five o'clock ' bus, etc. 
Now I 
never can look that young girl in the face. 
For if she but tells, I 
shall get in disgrace, • 
am chaffed all the way, till I 
reach my abode, 
For somehow the story's got known on the road; 
Then old city gentlemen, be careful, please, 
And don't let a 
young lady sit on your knees, 
Or you'll have to put up with the chaff and the fuss, 
How about the young girl and the five o'clock ' bus. 
For the five o'clock ' bus, etc. 
PAUGH-A-BALLAGH BOYS.

CRONIN. 
Published by JOHN F. PERRI', 538 Washington Street, Boston, 
Mass. 
Oh I 
we've just come out before ye, we'll tell ye who we are, 
We are the jolly warriors that's just returned from war; 
We thrashed the foe before we left, and now we'll shout with 
joy, 
So lift yer hats and give three cheers for the Paugh-a-Ballagh 
boys. 
CHORUS. 
Hip! hip! hurrah! 
Hip! hip! hurrah! 
Hip! hip! hurrah! 
[Sgtout]—Tiger. 
For the Faugh a 
Ballagh boys, the lads that fear no noise; 
Wherever we go, we make a 
show, we are the ladies' joys, 
So clap your hands, and give three cheers, and don't you fear 
the noise; 
The war is past, we're home at last, the Faugh- Ballagh 
boys. 
Oh! the captain who commanded us, his like was never seen, 
He lost an arm, a 
leg, an' a 
head, and was shot through his 
canteen, 
He never lost his courage, until he lost his head. 
When that was taken from him, oh ! this is what it said: 
Hip! hip! hurrah! etc. 
While the band is playing sweetly, the tunes we love to hear, 
Our hearts beat with emotion, when the music strikes our ears: 
The left foot first, the right foot next, with pride we roll our 
eyes, 
While the duckey darlings shake the rag at the Faugh-a-Bal-
lagh boys. 
Hip! hip I

I 
am about the coolest card, 
That ever you did see; 
No matter what is going on. 
It never troubles me; 
I 
never get annoy'd, because 
I 
act up to this rule: 
To treat the world as Burgundy, 
And always take it cool. 
CHORUS. 
Burgundy Benjamin, coolest of men, 
Always cool, that is my rule, 
Burgundy Benjamin, coolest or men, 
By all I'm called " Cool, Burgundy Ben." 
The coolest wine to drink's Champagne, 
Because it makes a 
noise, 
It fizzes, but it don't come up 
To Burgundy, my boys! 
I 
must be cool, I 
won't be vexed, 
No matter where or when, 
And so I 
drink cool Burgundy, 
Ah! that's the stuff for Ben. 
Burgundy Benjamin, etc. 
It's ever my companion 
If breakfast, sup, or dine, 
It's then I 
crack a 
bottle of

At night I 
keep the coolest head, 
No matter where I 
go, 
All friends acknowledge I'm about 
The coolest card they know! 
Burgundy Benjamin, etc. 
I 
hate to see a 
bustling man. 
I 
think that man a 
fool. 
I 
don't know why, this wide wide world, 
All things can't take them cool. 
I'd even have the roughs be cool ; 
Remember what I 
say! 
It's just as well to take things in 
The coolest sort of way. 
Burgundy Benjamin, etc. 
This song has made rue warm. I 
ought 
To be as cold as ice; 
T 
would not for the world look warm, 
No, not at any price. 
If you keep cool and sing this song, 
Wherever you may go, 
It's wonderful how popular 
Cool Burgundy will grow!

YOU KNOW THE SLATE IS BROKE, 
Copyright secured, 1876, by A. J. FISHER. 
As sung by PAT ROONEY, at the Olympic Theatre, 
In these now hard, uncertain times, 
They do things very queer ; 
If you hav'nt got the ready cash, 
You cannot get your beer; 
The man behind the bar will say, 
Just by way of a 
joke— 
He'll shake his head with a 
meaning smile— 
You know the slate is broke. 
CRoars. 
You're welcome in, to spend your tin, 
To have a 
drink or smoke; 
But you'd better put the money up, 
For you know the slate is broke. 
When you're daily labor is ended, 
And to walk you feel inclined ; 
As you pass along the busy street, 
How many friends you'll find; 
They'll say to you, come and take a 
drink--
You'll return it with a 
smoke ; 
But you'd better put the money up, 
For you know the slate is broke. 
You're welcome, &c.

FISHER, in the office of the Librarian of Congr. ss, at Washingt,en. 
Written and sung by the FIELDINOS. 
Erin, dear Erin, when again shall we see thee? 
Those dear days of yore, we nc'er can forget, 
When children, your Emblem, 
The Shamrock, we cherished ; 
But now, in a 
strange land, 
We linger and fret. 
CHORUS, 
Erin, dear Erin, 
Shall we never caress thee, 
Or gaze once again 
On thy green mossy shore ? 
Our hearts they are beating, 
For friendless we wander. 
Erin, dear Erin, 
Shall we see thee no more. 
Erin, dear Erin, our heart's fondest treasure, 
Both day and by night, our thoughts are with thee. 
Our Fathers and Mothers, 
God bless and protect them. 
Oh! when shall we ever, 
Their dear faces see ?

My name is Dunleaven I'm a 
trim Irishman, Sir, 
From the Ca(nt North of Ireland I 
came ; 
I 
was christcn'd Cornelius. if I 
understand, Sir, 
That's the handle ' twas put to my name ; 
When but a 
wee Gossoon, the old man's coat I'd put on, 
For I 
always was fond of such jokes; 
When all of a 
sudden you'd hear him a 
shoutin'— 
Won't you never lave off that ould coat? 
CHORUS, 
I 
have traveled from Belfast all over creation, 
But I 
never yet had such a 
stroke, 
As when those boys shout—without my aprobation— 
Won't you never lave off that ould coat ? 
This coat has seen numbers of great revolutions, 
In what they call fashion and style ; 
But I'm bound to stick to it with a 
firm resolution. 
In spite of their gibes and their smiles ; 
They don't understand this was made for the Grand 
Duke of Derry, whose name I 
can boast, 
Or they'd never cry out, or attempt for to shout, 
Won't you never lave off that wild coat ? 
I 
have traveled, &o.

The mill shut down to-thy, dear wife, 
There's nothing here to eat, 
And look, the boots I've worn a 
year 
Are dropping off my feet; 
My clothes are hardly decent, wife, 
While you are ragged, too, 
And famine stares us in the face, 
Oh, what are we to do. 
Oh, what are we to do, dear wife. 
I 
cannot get my pay; 
The grocer's bill is over due, 
The mill shut down to-day. 
The mill shut down to-day, dear wife, 
The coal is nearly gone. 
And see, there's scarcely wood enough 
To kindle in the morn; 
The landlord will be coming soon 
To get the rent from you, 
And I 
have not a 
cent to pay 
The bills becoming due. 
The mill shut down to-day, dear wife, 
The snow is on the ground, 
And hark! the piercing winds without 
How mournfully they sound; 
The children have no shoes to wear, 
They cry for milk and bread, 
But, wife, the mills have stopped to-day, 
How shall we all be fed ? 
Oh, what, tio. 
THE TIPPERARY MEN, 
Song only by DIAMOND and RYAN. 
LIND friends we've just come over, 
From old Ireland right away, 
For the times they were so very had, 
No longer we could stay; 
For meat and drink we could not get, 
The landlords kept us poor, 
:ill at last we had to bid adieu, 
To Erin's lonely shore. 
crioars. 
Although we're far away, my boys, 
We love Ireland just the same, 
At a 
tight or lair, you 
hnd us there, 
We're both Tipperary men. 
They say 110 Irish need apply, 
Sure, that I 
don't understand, 
For where do they get such brave big boys, 
As those from Paddy's land; 
If Britain was to go to war, boys, 
What would she do then. 
Unless the ranks were well filled up 
With Tipperary men. 
Although we're far away, etc. 
If you happen to go to Ireland, 
Hospitality you'll find there, 
If a 
poor man has only a 
drink of milk, 
By my soul you'll get your share; 
No matter friends, how poor you be, 
Its there you”.1 find a 
friend, 
Yes, warm-hearted you will find, 
The Ti dperary men. 
Although we're far away, etc.

We hope we have amused you, 
With our funny little song; 
Some other time we'll come again, 
When we are passing ' long. 
Vemember this when you go home, 
You have seen something new 
Before, that's very good for you,

SOMETHING THAT OUGHT TO BE DONE, 
Motto Song. 
Sung by FRANK LEWIS with great success. 
This world is advancing each moment and hour, 
And startling improvements are made, 
Each nation is striving to gain greater power, 
All others to throw in the shade. 
And each individual struggles along, 
For he knows that when life is begun, 
To gain great distinction ) he really must try 
To do something that's never been done. 
This city has many attractions, I 
own, 
But still there is something amiss, 
The streets and the parks should be kept neat and clean, 
My idea for improvement is this. 
There are plenty of good honest men out of work, 
With hunger and debt overrun, 
They are willing to toil, let us give them the chance, 
It is something that ought to be done. 
Our country is burdened with debt and distress, 
Its people are suffering, too. 
Our finances are in a 
terrible mess, 
And the prospect at present looks blue. 
There is only one way to prosperity now, 
For corruption has had a 
long run, 
We should have the right man at the head of our land, 
It is something that ought to be done.

ROOK THE ORA 
Written 
DLE, PAT, 
and sung by JOHNNY Roam with great success 
AIR— Rock the Cradle, John. 
PADDY BURKE was a 
man of work, from Limerick town he 
came, 
He married a 
buxom Irish lass, and she went by the nam, 
Kane; 
Now Pat ttnd his wife, through six years' strife, were m 
ver 
blessed with a 
child, 
And when she seen one in any one's arms, this is what sne'd 
cry: 
CHORUS. 
Rock the cradle, Pat, rock the cradle, Pat, 
There's many a 
man would give his right arm, 
To have a 
child like that. 
Now the war broke out, and Paddy, stout, he swore be 4 
go 
and ' list; 
To hear his wife's tongue always ding-dong, ' twould drive hint 
out of his wits; 
So off he went, left her to repent, for doing a 
thing so wrong, 
For fathering him with that mortal sin, and singing that beastly 
song: 
Rock the cradle, Pat, he.-
24 
Now Paddy Burke, this man oi work, he hadn't been Ic-ng 
away, 
Till his wife fell in with a 
big spalpeen who soon led her astray; 
For three years long there love was strong, till one line summer's 
day, 
Paddy Burke, this man of work, came singing her tavoritt. 
Rock the cradle, Pat, &c. 
Well, Pat looked round, and soon he found a 
baby hale and 
strong, 
And turning to his wife, the pride of his life, said, 
"Who has been here since I 
was gone ?" 
It was Providence, Pat," she said, " done that, he was good 
to me three years long, 
Am? now you can, with my other man, sing my favorite song. 
Rock the cradle, Pat, &c.

SOMEONE'S WATCHING AT THE

Price 10 cents. 
Someone's watching at the window, 
Where the people hurry by, 
Listening for a 
well-known footstep, 
With a 
bright and eager eye. 
For they cherish still a 
promise 
Of a 
heart they know is true, 
Who has whispered, love, to- morrow, 
I 
will come again to you. 
CIIORUS. 
Someone's watching at the window, 
With their face.against the pane; 
Someone's softly, sweetly saying, 
"Will he, will he come again ?" 
Someone's growing very weary, 
As the moments come and go; 
Where the wayward one is wandering 
They would dearly like to know. 
Surely he can never linger 
From my side so long and late, 
When he knows the sweetest welcome, 
Here, his coming doth await. 
Someone's:watcliing, etc. 
Someone's dreaming of the story, 
Ever new and ever old, 
That they long to hear repeated, 
Though it often has been told, 
They are from the past recalling, 
All their many dreams of bliss, 
Hearing not the footsteps falling, 
'Till they are startled with a 
kiss. 
Someone's watching, etc.

MY name is Roger O'Malley, understand, 
And don't begin for to doubt me; 
I 
own my own house, and a 
bit o' land, 
There's no common stock about me. 
I 
went to college when a 
boy, 
And left with heaps of lore; 
And came out here to this free land, 
Just pravious to the war. 
CHORUS. 
Roger O'Malley, that's my name 
Quite famous I 
have grown; 
I'm far superior to Muldoon, 
Mulcahey or Malone. 
I'm quite independent in my way, 
Iligh-ton'd and well educated;. 
All my taxes I'm ready for to pay, 
And I'm not in the least dissipated. 
I 
can take a 
drink, and smoke a 
cigar, 
With comfort and delight; 
But you'll never see me Ioafin' round 
The whiskey bars at night. 
Roger O'Malley, &c. 
I'm as dacent a 
man as you can find, 
Like all my seven generations; 
With a 
good deal of laming in my inin 
Which I 
use on important occasions; 
I'm far above yer common scraps, 
That fling their names all round, 
And they'll not catch me in any traps, 
For I'm sensible and sound. 
Roger O'Malipy 
I'm a 
marshal whenever we parade, 
I 
ride a 
horse from Araby; 
With a 
big stick of honor in my hand, 
Sure, in martial aflairs I'm no baby. 
I 
ate my fill, an(' wear good clothes, 
Made up in the style you see; 
My walk is grand, and plainly shows 
That there's no such man as me.

This dashing Irish couple. 
We sailed away fro n

And crossed the briny seal ; 
So now we're here and settled down 
In this tree land—America. 
We've saved enough to buy the farm, 
And we are doing well yon see. 
So you are welcome for to call on us 
In a 
foreign part of sweet Jersey. 
CHORUS. 
So you see we are two thorough brede, 
Our likes you never scanned 
For we are always happy, tear-a-nouns

Written expressly for JAMES O'NEIL by ROBERT McKay. 
I 
AM a 
jovial Irish lad— 
Ever ready for a 
spree; 
A wake or fair, the divil may care— 
It's all the same to me. 
For wid a 
colleen by me side, 
A 
blackthorn in ihe hand; 
I 
show them the style in which it's done 
In dear ould Ireland. 
SPOKEN,--Yis, boys, I'm always in for a 
bit kw fun, no mat-

find it. 
The other day as I 
was walking up 
Broadway, I 
stoppei in at a 
menagerie, an' while I 
was lookin' 
at the sea lion a 
man stepped up, and says he, 
A

"Oh," says he, " he lives on suction." "Is that so?" says I. 
Ye see he was givin' me a " kid," thinkin' I 
was a 
greenhorn. 
That's so," says he, smilin' all over like a 
basket av chips, 
" 
Well, thin," says I, " he must be well kept, for be Heavens 
there's plinty av suckers around :" an' I 
walked oil singin'— 
CHORUS, 
I've only just come over 
From the Green Isle on the sea. 
I'll not forget that little spot 
Wherever I 
may be. 
I've only just come over, 
But make no mistake d'ye see, 
Although Eve just come over— 
Ye 
come over me.

S4 
Thin as I 
walked along the street, 
The boys at me did shout-
-" 
I'll have the coat !" " Pull down yer vest!" 
" 
Does yer mother know yer out ?" 
I 
stopped at wanst, and thin around 
Like bees they quickly flew, 
An' for an hour or more was ruz 
The divil's hulabaloo ! 
SPOKEN.—" Why don't ye shoot the hat ?" says one fellow, 
"Ilould on," says I, " an' I'll shoot it for ye itnmagently," I 
took off me caubeen and put a 
ball through it at wanst. 
afeard it'll never recover.) " Pull down yer vest" says another, 
"I would," says I, " but me uncle' wanted it, an' so I 
lint it 
to him." " Don't give it away," was another's advice; " Divil 
a 
bit," Says I, 
I 
only lint it to him." " Does yeemother know 
yer out ?" remarked a 
cross-eyed chap with red hair; " 
says I, " she gave me her blessin' the da I 
came out to Amer-
ica." 
That set them all laughilf, an' I 
walked oil singin'— 
I've only just come over, 4tc.

As sung by JENNIE IL:Gnus% 
ARRATI ! Mickey, will ye leave 113 thus, 
To cross the raging main; 
When gone, what will become of me, 
Should you neer conic back again: 
The Hawthorn i 
may flower in Spring! 
The Daisy bright may grow— 
But naught to me will comfort bring, 
If you, my darling, go. 
CHORUS, 
Arrah ! Mickey, put your frieze coat on, 
Walk through the bog with me; 
And you can whisper in my ear, 
How dearly you love me. 
What need you leave your native land, 
We've courted many a 
year— 
Then stop where sweet the Shamrock grows, 
Stop with your Kathleen dear. 
Though peace and plenty waits on there, 
In that land 
beyant 
the sea! 
To break my heart is hardly fair, 
So stop with love and m". 
Arrah! Mickey, & c. 
My Granny's got a 
cow and pig-, 
An eight-day clock and all; 
With a 
picture of St. Patrick, 
That hangs against UK, wall. 
There's an arm chair stands beyant the nook, 
Close by the bright turf fire; 
_ 
Where the " potheen 
bottle lies concealed, 
What more can you desire. 
Arrah ! 
I've got pots and kettles shining bright, 
To deck our Cottage out; 
The boys and girls are waiting, dear, 
The welcome news to shout, 
That yon will stay among us all, 
And the lark will sweeter sing; 
And the bells from every village spire 
The joyful news shall ring. 
Arrah' Mickey tkc.

BIDDIE DOYLE. 
As Sung by JAS. O'NEIL. 
Oh 1 
I 
have come over here, Biddie Doyle, 
For to tell you pretty clear, Biddie Doyle, 
For to gain your heart and band, 
As you will understand, 
And to be at your command, Biddie Doyle. 
So I 
will always prove true, 
No matter what you do, 
And I 
will stick to you like glue, Biddie Doyle. 
Ohl the summer is past and gone, Biddie Doyle. 
And the winter is coming on, Biddie Doyle; 
And the stormy winds will blow, 
it will hail, rain and snov,*, 
9nd what will become of you. Biddie Doyle. 
What will you do at all, 
When the snow begins to fall, 
With your back against the wall, Biddie Doyle. 
You know how it is yourself, Biddie Doyle, 
You will soon be on the shelf, Blddie Doyle; 
You know you are old enough, 
And your face is getting rough, 
Another year will make you tough, Biddie Doyle. 
So leave off your lamentation, 
And increase the population, 
Or you are not worthy of your nation, Biddie Doyle. 
Oh 1 
when I 
go on a 
spree, Biddie Doyle, 
I 
will raise lots of fun, you'll see, Biddie Doyle; 
If I 
should come home tight, 
Don't try to raise a 
fight, 
Or 
give you a 
box that wil I 
make you quiet, Biddie Doyle; 
Don't call the neighbors around me. 
Or if you do, 
surely pound you. 
And I 
will spit on you and dromn you, Biddie Doyle.

There's Roger and fat Mickey and big Dan, that makes the three. 
But of all the gang fat Mickey sure he looks the most like me.

At atom' or at slapein sure his like cannot be found. 
At snorein' he's the divil; now believe me when I

You can hear him snore from Tubby hook, across the Dublin hie% 
And lie can ate his size in mate, or pack the grub below; 
At drinking Irish whiskey sure. egad, he is not slow.

day you'll see him every year. 
He walks along the Boulevard, so proudly and so gay, 
And whin the girls observe him, sure you'll always hear them 
say, 
Now there's Dan, Ste. 
They say at Plully-del-phia they're going to have a 
fair, 
And all the curiosities they tell me will be there; 
I. think I'll take fat Mickey there, and enter him for style, 
I 
know his fat appear-u-ance will cause ' em all to smile. 
And it they give a 
premium for " lads that are not quick," 
1 
think he'll get the medal, sure, the boy we calls our Mies.. 
For sure lw is no good at all, he never worked a 
day, 
And it you say a 
word to him his mammy's sure to say, 
Now there's Dan, ite.

Now, Mollie Mavourneen, 
Wherever I 
roam, 
In seeking my fortune, 
Way far from home, 
I'll think of you, darling, 
Where e'er I 
may be. 
Now Mollie, dear, tell me, 
Will you think of me ? 
There's no chance for me haie, 
For the taxes are great; 
Like a 
great many more, 
1aure, I 
must emigrate 
To the laud where our forefathers 
Welcome did get; 
A 
favor that Irishmen 
Never forget. 
Now, Barney, you've axed me 
A 
dozen times o'er, 
To share heart and fortune 
With you, evermoro. 
To part with you, darling, 
lleart t 
viotticl break., 
So I'll leave my birth-place, 
Though it makes my heart ache. 
There's a 
welcome, they say, 
In that land o'er the sea— 
'Tis America, I 
mean, shure, 
The land of the free. 
May the love that we feel 
For each other to-day, 
Never die, when from Ireland 
We 
Lire far away. 
CHORUS. 
Now, Barney Avourneen, 
I 
can't part with you, 
Our parting, you know, 
Would break my heart in OM 
So we will not part, then, 
Acushla Machree, 
But sail for America, 
The land of the Daft. 
As Sung by JENNY IT UGIIE. 
DID you iver see Meg, dashing Galway Meg, 
The wickedest witch in Ould Erin, 
Who has eyes like a 
sloe, and a 
bosom of snow, 
That t 
he boys are all toasting ant cheering, 
Such cheeks, och the roses and the lips (Father Moses), 
To taste them would make you quite tipsy, 
Thin whiniver you're dead or with spirits of lead, 
Take a 
smack from the mouth of this gipsy. 
Meg can clear a 
stone wall with a ! nettlesome nag, 
Leap a 
ditch with the best in the chase, 
Sound the whoop tally ho ! to the hounds on the go, 
And come out the first man in the race, 
Such an air and such hair when she springs don't you 
stare, 
But be aisey and plaise not get friskey, 
For a 
squint at her foot, and her ancle to boot, 
Would warm you all over like whiskey. 
She can dance, she can sing, in the ould Irish way, 
Take a 
noggin, and swing a 
Shillelah, 
She's the belle of the fair when the girls are all there, 
And the queen of the court where she may be. 
Such a 
neck ! such a 
waist ( Och hould me, make haste,) 
To clasp them would make you onaisey, 
Your courage is gone, and you're conquered, 0

IRISH ElVIIGRANTS. 
Written and Sung by SCULLY & MASTER BARRY, 
Oh, kind folks listen to us, 
A 
story we will tell 
About dear old Ireland, 
The place we love so well. 
We left there about a 
year ago 
To seek our fortune in the West, 
But if we'd stayed in Ireland 
It would have been best. 
CHORUS. 
For we are—yes we are— 
Two Irish Emigrants, me boys; 
For we are—yes we are— 
Two Irish Emigrants. 
Ould Ireland is the place 
For frolic or for fun ; 
It is the dearest spot to us 
That's underneath the Sun; 
But here we are strangers, 
In this big City, so grand; 
And we won't be contented 
'Till on Irish soil we stand. 
For we are, &c. 
But we are staying here too long, 
We must be away; 
We hope we pleased ye with our song, 
So we won't stay all clay, 
But we will go right home 
And pack up our clothes; 
For we are off to Ireland, 
Where the apple praties grows. 
For we are, &c.

I 
saw her first in golden hours, 
With primrose stars appearin', 
0, Queen was she of all the flow'rs, 
The lovely Rose of Erin ; 
Beneath the shade of Irish hills, 
Their Isle's own colors wearin', 
Ah! where smiled the shamrock all the day, 
There dwelt the Rose of Erin, 
Dwelt the Rose of Erin. 
I 
saw her next in summer time, 
With ev'ry charm endearin', 
For she was :n 
her girlhood's prime, 
The lovely Rose of Erin ; 
We met beside the banks of Erne, 
No thought of sorrow fearin' ; 
Ah yet oft I 
thought her lily pale, 
My darlin' Rose of Erin. 
Darlin' Rose of Erin. 
Alas! alas on Autumn's wave, 
r0 Heaven her bark was steerin', 
And I, no pray'r of mine might save, 
My lovely Rose of Erin; 
Ah! well a- day the Angela came, 
My heart's own garden nearin', 
Ah! and took from earth to bloom in Ileav'n, 
My lovely Rose of Erin,

I'd give my gold, my silver plate, likewise my army,

I'm proud you know, 
Wnerever I

There's one thing, me boys, I'd have you MAN

Words and Music by HARRY KENNEDY. 
Sung by the Favorite Balladist, Miss ALICE D'Ennie. 
The shores of dear Erin recede from my sight, 
As swiftly our bark glides the waters so bright; 
And eager I 
look, with a 
sorrowful gaze 
Upon the dear land where I've passed all my days. 
My thoughts turn to home, and the dear faces there, 
And for my dear Kathleen I 
breathe a 
fond prayer, 
And say, as the land quickly fades from my view, 
God bless you, Colleen, I 
know you'll be true. 
God bless you, Colleen, I 
know you'll be true, 
True to the heart that beats only for you; 
Think of me, darling, when from you I 
stray, 
God bless you, Colleen, when I'm far away. 
A 
tear dimmed my eyes, as with feeling oppressed, 
I 
stiffied the sob that arose in my breast; 
And thought of the long days of sorrow and pain, 
Before I 
could see thee, my darling again. 
That night in my dream I 
returned to my home, 
And through the green meadows with Kathleen did roam, 
But making the old words come back anew, 
God bless you, Colleen, I 
know you'll be true. 
God bless you, etc.

TWO THOROUGHBREDS FROM IRELAND 
Composed and sung with great success by HABay OssoaNZ

On here we are two thoroughbreds, 
From Ireland all the way, 
Weleft hat sparkling little isle, 
Her brooks and winding bays; 
ricer forget the shamrock green 
Tht grows upon thy shore, 
Not if centurie;: thy freedom should restore. 
CHORUS. 
Machree, Machree, we long to see the day, 
Asthore, Asthore, the enemy to slay, 
And plant the flag of freedom 
With harp and shamrock bright, 
While we are marching to the fight boys. 
That was a 
glorious day of the patriots whose names 
Should emblazon every honored roll 
With glory and with fame; 
They are rescued from the tyrant's grip, 
Australia's fettered chains, 
So hurrah for the gallant boys, the Fenians. 
CHORUS. 
March on, March on, 
One victory is won; 
And yet we'll have that dear green Isle 
Restored to freedom's sons, 
This work we hope will soon be done,
