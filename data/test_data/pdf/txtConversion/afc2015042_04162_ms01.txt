Summary of  Interview / Event: 
Jenni Harris is the fifth generation of the Harris family to lead White Oak Pastures. She describes finding her 
place in the business during a time of transition in US agriculture and in consumer awareness. Marketing and 
selling the meat, eggs, pet treats, leather goods, and more, that the farm produces brings together every aspect 
of the business and supports the growth of the land, each animal, each plant and each employee. 
Interview Log: 
0 00 25 My name is Jennifer Kate Harris. I was born on Sept 28, 1986 in Albany, Georgia and my title is the 
Director of Marketing for White Oak Pastures.  
0 00 48 Jenni describes what a Director of Marketing for a farm does — she maintains the balance of the 
three legs of the business stool: production, processing, and sales. “All three of those legs have to be in line 
with each other for the stool to be a viable seat. Production obviously comes first. As a farm we grow 
animals. We raise ten species of animals —  cattle, goats, sheep, hogs, rabbits, chickens, turkeys, ducks, geese, 
and guineas. The second leg comes in, once we’re done growing. We need to process them according to 
customer specifications or our own line specifications. And, the last leg is the sales leg that takes care of 
inventory.” Jenni describes that on a farm, there aren’t really clear, discreet lines of labor. Since sales is sort of 
the last line in the operation, she says, it’s the job of the sales and marketing staff to understand what is 
happening in the pasture, understand the workflow of the processing plant which harvests the animals for 
sale and then take all of that information and communicate it effectively to the people who might be 
interested in it.  
0 02 12 Doing marketing on the farm is a really fun job because it takes into account every part of the 
production system. This is particularly true, Jenni says, because White Oak Pastures is a vertically integrated 
farm—raising, slaughtering, butchering and shipping all from their location in Bluffton, Georgia. As the 
Director of Marketing it’s a lot of fun to find out what’s happening in the pasture and to make educated calls 
for the plant to then deliver [meat] to the consumer in a way that they’ll appreciate it.  
0 02 58 On keeping tabs on all that is happening on the farm. “We’re blessed with technology and “line of 
site” via cameras.” In addition to regular meetings with livestock managers, Jenni travels the farm to directly 
observe the animals and the land so that she can describe it to customers. “It’s up to sales to paint a picture 
of the ‘X’ months or years of life that went into producing that pork chop…and you can’t really do that from 
behind a computer.”  
0 03 55 On her beginnings at White Oak Pastures, from growing up on the farm to becoming an employee. 
She majored in marketing then moved to Atlanta to work for Sysco’s speciality meat company, Buckhead 
Beef. My dad’s rule was that family had to work 365 days—at least one year—somewhere else before you 
could work for him. Jenni describes how she put in her 365 days at Buckhead Beef, learning about the meat 
industry from a different perspective and on her 366th day in 2010, moving back to the farm. 
0 04 50 What marketing and sales were like when she started in 2010. As a farm, we really focused on 
grassfed beef and focused on retailers like Publix and Whole Foods and distributors, like Sysco. She describes 
White Oak Pastures’ as having very lean administration…there were cowboys and there were butchers. She 
describes the reasons they’ve created a farm that employees a photographer, an accountant and a chef and 
retail staff who work in their farm store.

“Agriculture isn’t just cowboys and processing isn’t just butchering, there’s now a whole team of people…and 
that’s one of the things that I’m most proud of from an agricultural movement perspective…we’ve expended 
what it means to work  in agriculture.  Even if you’re an accountant or a chef, you can still be in the 
agricultural industry, whereas fifty years ago? Probably not.” 
0 06 42 On how she got into marketing given her introverted personality. I knew she would ultimately end up 
on the farm, I wasn’t exactly sure where, but I knew I wanted to work with my father. When Jenni arrived, she 
saw that he had good management and had a vision for what he wanted. She noticed his weak point was 
reaching the consumer and understanding how marketing worked. She studied marketing because she realized 
that it was part of every industry “and so from a job security perspective, I’d be taken care of…and so that’s 
how that’s how I ultimately arrived at marketing…”  
0 08 13 On transition from daughter to family employee. The first two years I followed my Dad around. I had 
some small responsibilities but I was really able to allow him to mentor me in business in general and that was 
an invaluable experience. Learning how to conduct myself….learning what to say and learning the things that 
were special…I was able to watch my father navigate such a burgeoning industry…to figure out where our 
space was…I began wanting to accept more accountability for a part of the business and so I took something 
he had no interest in, which was the online store. I built the website and helped create an environment in 
which we could have some e-commerce and that’s really where I’ve put a lot of my time and effort.  
0 09 43 On the narrative and context provided online. Jenni describes how she crafted the story of White 
Oak Pastures in ways that customers, staff and family alike find compelling and true.  
0 11 35 On her early job to collect the narratives of 150 years of the farm and the complexities of doing so. 
0 12 28 On the moment she understood her father’s new vision for the family farm. It was in 2009 at the 
Georgia Organics conference…Literally not a day ever passed without my talking to him but I didn’t know 
the type of consumer he began marketing to… ‘my college years were spent with him explaining to me 
there’s a specific, sophisticated consumer who’s made a specific decision about the food they eat. They’ve 
studied the food production system and they want something different…” 
0 13 57 On the inspiring diversity of the sustainable agriculture industry…I was at a Georgia Organics 
conference and looked down at people’s feet and saw the loafers of businessmen and the barefeet of some 
farmers who wanted to be as in touch with the land as possible and I thought to myself, ‘what industry can 
have this range of people? 
0 14 30 On why the sustainable agriculture consumer is not mirrored in the local community. 
0 15 26 Jenni describes the Savory Institute and healing land with animal impact through specific grazing 
protocols…White Oak Pastures is one of 27 international Savory Hubs… 
0 16 26 On the farm employees hard work and their understanding of the larger impact of their work in the 
context of the industrial/commodity food system. 
0 17 50 Jenni walks through a typical workday from sunrise with her six month old son…Most of my time is 
in the office unless I’m with a customer…She describes always being in multiple conversations, in constant 
communication with all parts of the farm operations. It’s really important that production, processing and 
sales stay on the same page and I’m the link among all of those different levels…for example, my brother-in-
law has to know that Thanksgiving is coming up and we can sell 5,000 turkeys…so in July he needs to be 
receiving poults for the upcoming Thanksgiving season…then we need to know what we’re able to process in 
terms of a plant perspective at that time and what we’re able to inventory from a freezer perspective…all os 
that we’ve got the ability to sell…it takes so much communication to make this thing work…we’re all used to

not relying on a routine…so there is no typical day…We may have a new grind one day and there will be a 
spontaneous a tasting for the staff… 
0 20 28 On the volume of people they work with. We have sales from Princeton, NJ to Miami, FL. We also 
work with five or six distributors that sell to our meats to universities and they have a lot of buyin power. We 
also sell to chefs in cities like Miami and New York City and Atlanta and the end-consumers is served through 
the online store which probably take the most time… 
0 22 32 On the difference between selling to retail grocery buyers vs. directly to end-consumers. They 
probably don’t understand that that animal they’re eating was two years old at the time we slaughtered it and 
that it’s mama was pregnant with it for 283 days and that all-told it was a three-year investment…and if that’s 
not explained or if they’re not instructed on how to cook a free-range animal, they might have a bad 
experience with it and then just like that, a three-year investment we made is for nothing so we really like to  
see that story of that animal all the way through.  
0 23 25 On how she cultivated the White Oak Pastures community while traveling the US to market their 
meat. 
0 24 45 On the current Paleo diet trend and other public information that affects their business. 
0 25 27 On the popularization of bone broth and how as a farm and as farmers they’ve always looked to 
utilize entire carcass. And how that coincided added value…with a zero-waste production model that creates 
value out of many ‘odd ends’ like tracheas which are used in the pet treat industry…  
0 27 29 On conveying true stories and depth of story on limited package space…on what to say and what not 
to say…On the long website narrative which means more to us than all our certifications… 
0 28 45 We’re not good at marketing from a conventional standpoint, we’re just painfully honest. Our 
marketing strategy is just to be transparent and if it fits with what you’re looking for, we welcome you to take 
part in it. If it doesn’t, good luck on your search.  
0 30 22 On the working parts of the marketing team…from packing and shipping online orders to the staff 
photographer capturing events. On how images are paramount for Jenni’s Facebook-Instagram-Snapchat 
generation. On the five second attention span of our consumer and the importance of investing in 
photography that inspires investigation. 
0 31 40 On transitioning from a poetic, wordy weekly newsletter to a photo-only every-other week newsletter. 
0 32 39 On White Oak Pasture’s legendarily crude sense of humor…A recent blog entry title, “Because You 
Give a Flock.” 
0 33 35 On skills required for someone in her position…patience…and making good on promises as 
marketers… 
0 35 25 On things Jenni would like to see in the future…growing online sales so they support the farm. 
Larger wholesale customers are unstable…it’s a price game and they often only buy one item… 
0 38 58 On the delights of the job…Working with family—working under her father and alongside her wife, 
sister, and brother-in-law and on creating a life for her son and niece…seeing the generational strength in the 
business is a lot of fun for me. I also really enjoy the staff…I know my purpose at 30. 
0 41 15 On the evolution of her physical office space, from sitting between the only two bathrooms in the 
plant—50 people sharing one women’s restroom and one men’s and my desk between the two doors…to 
having her own office, and on why she never closes her office door…
