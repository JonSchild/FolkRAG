THE NEVERSINIC. 
Words and Music by J. E. Murphy, of MURPHY & MACK. 
We'll sing of our good ship Neversink, 
That brought us o'er the sea, 
And of the pretty girls we love, 
Who said, be trne to me. 
Of course we will, was our reply, 
We'll be so true to thee; 
As we said farewell, our bonnie belles 
Both commenced to cry— 
CHORUS. 
Good-bye, Jack, ' till you come back, 
As she kissed her hand to me: 
I'll watch for you, I'll pray for you, 
Will you be true?" says she. 
Good luck, Jack, ' till you come back, 
I'll be so true to thee, 
All for your sake I'll watch and wait 
Untill you return for me. 
We're going on board the Neversink, 
And her jolly crew, 
And laugh at the time we had on shore, 
And how we sang and danced for you. 
When we do retuin again, 
And your smiling faces see, 
You will remember us two arid our jolly crew, 
And the songs we sang for you.

MARY HUGHES. 
Words and music by J. E. 
MURPHY of MuRrnY& MACS. 
At the age of twenty with money plenty 
And a 
trunk lull of clothes and shoes, 
In a 
tenement full of devilment 
I 
first met Mary Hughes; 
As Mary was just over, 
With her relations site stopped then, 
She was neat and sweet and so pretty 
That my heart she did ensnare; 
'Twas only a 
short time after 
Her vows she did abuse, 
She got tight and used to fight, 
And she sold my clothes and shoes. 
CHORUs. 
Mary Hughes you give me the blues, 
Ain't it awful you so fond of your booze, 
You are going to destruction, 
You are doing as you choose, 
You have tue crazy Mary Hughes. 
Mary me honey ; she spent me money 
And I 
working hard all day, 
Upon Saturday night. ' twas me great delight 
To give her al my pay; 
Shure I 
often told her 
For to save for a 
rainy day, 
With a 
jump and a 
skip she'd twist her lip, 
The devil a 
bit she'd care; 
Me troubles are near over, Mary is gone 
I 
don't know where, 
If she's out of me sight I 
can sleep at night, 
For her no more I 
care. 
Mary Hughes you, etc.

And not disturb a

No sooner said than done, 
Oh, you never saw such fun, 
To see him fall and make the dishes ring; 
McCarty got so excited, 
And young Dasey he invited, 
To come outside and have a

Some fellow shouted Mick Dasey threw a

Which laid McCarty out upon the tloor.--Cmit.

BONNIE MOON. 
Words and music by J. Ellen Murphy. 
Composed expressly for Miss LEA BEASLEY and sung by 
her only. 
Oh, see the new moon rising, 
To illuminate the sky, 
I'll say to those that are in love, 
Open wide your eyes and sigh. 
Gaze upon the moon for a 
moment, 
And if on its face you see, 
The one you love dearest, 
if then he does love thee. 
For I 
have often heard the old folks say, 
That it was sure a 
sign, 
If you imagine that you saw, 
Or pictured in your mind, 
The one that you do love the best, 
Appeared with the new moon tide, 
If his name von kept a 
secret, 
You would surely be his bride. 
ettoRUS. 
Bonnie, bonnie moon, 
Won't you show me soon. 
Picture on your pale face, 
A 
figure of a 
groom. 
Bonnie, honnie moon, 
Won't you show me soon, 
The man that Pm to marry, 
Bonnie nmon, bonnie moot ,. 
Fair moon with all your brightnefe,; 
Show me the one I 
love. 
If I 
were you and you were me, 
And I 
was there above, 
And if you were as deep in love, 
I 
would be grateful in showing yen, 
The one you were to marry. 
And tell if his heart was true, 
For I 
will pray both night 
And day till on your face I'll see, 
The one that has my heart in store, 
Fair lima ' tis with thee, 
If there is none my heart la won, 
By him whomI adore am I 
to be forsaktia 
I 
earnestly implore.

FOR GOODNESS SAKE DON'T SAY I

As

Pll 
of some yery strange things to night, 
But for goodness sake don't say I 
told you ; 
And if i 
ain't wrong I 
am certainly right, 
But for goodness sake don't say I told TOU ; 
It will SO(ui he the style of our la-de-da swells 
To wear bustles and longs just like the belles, 
,Tis hard fin. the men from the girls. now to tell, 
Bin for Er,oodne:.s sake don't say I 
told you. 
If you are married of course you'll agree, 
But for goodness sake don't say 
told you; 
That you a 
bachelor would like to be, 
But for goodness sake don't say I 
told YOU ; 
For ' tis the right of the ladies—ancient, young, 
And what is a 
woman if she can't use her tongue? 
For a 
woman would talk if she hadn't a 
lung, 
But for goodness sake don't say I 
told you. 
Now there is a 
charming young widow next door, 
Pot for gau,iness sake don't say I 
told you; 
She 1, :el 
seven hush:mils, and still wants one more, 
But for goodness sake don't say I 
tohi you; 
Though she wears

And LTes Up on Broadway each day to ma sh, 
She'lleaptnre some old ; u01 with plenty of cash, 
But for goodness sake don't say I 
told you. 
Among the bon-ton there's excitement just now, 
But for goodness sako don't say-I 
told you; 
The Wild Eesthetie Oscar is raising the row, 
But for goodness sake don't say I 
told you. 
Like Samson of old he wears very long hair, 
He sits up with a 
lily and (lines upon air, 
But Barnum will catch him it he don't take care, 
But for goodness sake don't say I

When nature smiles, on land and sea, 
I 
will return again to thee. 
When the robins nest again' 
And the flowers are in bloom, 
IX' hen the soringtime.'s sunny smile, 
Seems to banish all sorrow and gloom, 
Then my bonnie line- eyed 
If my heart is true till then, 
Has promised he'll return to me, 
When the robins nest again. 
Life seems so bright when in thought I'm with thee,

Seems to banish all sorrow and gloom; 
Then my bonnie blue-eyed lad, 
If my heart is true till then. 
Has promised he'll return to me,

Last night in a

I 
saw his proud ship wrecked at sea, 
And I

Could never comAack to me. 
But the spring-time and robins will come, 
And with them the bravest of men, 
For his last words were, darling, 
meet you 
When the robins nest again. 
DARLING LI1:14LE CISS. 
Written and sung M ISS M AUD BETHRI.y. 
Near to a 
hill flows a 
rill thro' a 
valley sweet, 
And in this .spot, stands a 
cot, a 
fairy like retreat; 
Within its wall is my all, darling Cissy Leigh, 
This little miss my joy and Miss, my hope and ecstasy. 
To the little homestead I 
oftimes pace, 
And nestle by my loved one's side; 
Rosy lushes inantle the dear little face 
Of my heart's fondest image and pride. 
CHORUS. 
Always smart, light of heart, singing like the thrush, 
Ever gay, come what may, cheeks of rosy blush, 
Pretty lace, nIl el grace, darling bright eyed Cias. 
And when we meet, I 
entreat one sweet, sweet kiss: 
O'er the fell, thro' the dell, in the starry gleam, 
We often stroll neath control of cupid's pious dream. 
From hawthorn tree night-birds see how often we em-
braced, 
The rabbits peep from burrows deep, when'er I 
kiss 
her face, 
And seated ' neath an old oak in this fairy dale, 
The stories of our hearts we nnfurl, 
And kisses often obstruct the sequel of our tale, 
I 
dearly love my darling rural pearl. 
Near dingle dell, bill or fell, not long will she reside, 
:For Cissy dear, in one half year, will leemy treasured bride 
The rural cot and each spot, we'll treasure with our bliss, 
For on its mould love tales we told, and shared many a 
kiss; 
When by the bond of wedlock the becomes my own, 
Often we will visit these scenes, 
For in this cosy welkin our love we have made known 
And spun our happy, Intypy loving dream;.

There is a 
charm I 
can't explain, 
About a 
girl Pie seen, 
My heart teats fast when she goes past, 
In a 
dark dress trim'd in green. 
Her eyes are bright as evening stars, 
So loving and so shy, 
And the folks all stop and look around 
When ever she goes by. 
CHORUS. 
And I 
feel just as happy as a 
big sun flower, 
That nods laid Lends in the breezes, 
And my heart is as light, as the wind that binees, 
The leaves from off the treezees. 
As days past on and we heeame, 
Like friends of olden tnnee. 
I 
thought the question I 
would pop, 
And ask her to be mine, 
But the answer I 
received next day, 
how could she treat nie. so? 
Instead of tieing mine tor life 
She simply answered No. 
And I

To cause me such distress,

ItieGILLIGAN'S SPITZ PUP. 
RECITATION. 
Written by M ANCHESTER and JENNING8 and recited ke 
them with great success. 
McGilligan had a 
Spitz pup 
Whose maiden name was zip, 
-ind everywhere he set his teeth 
He never lost his grip. 
His appetite was wonderful, 
He was never known to fail, 
And he'd bite a 
sirloin from your leg, 
If you stood upon his tail. 
McGilligan's Spitz Pup. 
His eyes they shone like diamonds, 
His head was small and round, 
And his tail it curled so tight 
It rais'd his hind legs from the ground; 
His hair was gray and shaggy, 
His skin so loose and slack, 
And the fleas had built a 
boarding house 
In the middle of his back. 
McGilligan's Spitz pup. 
Now, every dog must have his day, 
And then come down a 
peg, 
He met McGee's blind mule one day 
And grabbed him by the leg; 
In about two minutes 
He was plowing up the sidewal ,c 
with his head; 
He'll never bite another mule— 
McGilligan's Spitz is dead

Price, 40 cents. 
Oh, fancy brings a 
thought to me, 
Of flowers sweet and rare, 
With grace and beauty there combined, 
And brightest hues so fair; 
So like a 
maiden that I 
loved, 
It was my happy lot, 
I 
whispered when we parted last, 
Oh, you'll forget-me-not. 
CHORUS. 
Graceful and as charming as a

rune has passed so swiftly for of her I 
am so fond, 
Daisies and the roses too, they grow around the s!bot 
Where we parted and I 
whispered you'll forget-mead 
We met I 
really don't know where, 
But still ' tis all the same, 
For love walks in the busy streets, 
As well as in the lane. 
I 
gently pressed her tiny hand, 
She glanced at me a 
shot, 
She dropped a 
flower, I 
picked it up, 
A 
sweet forget-me-not. 
At last there came a 
happy day, 
And s•-unething that I 
said 
Just No.::ed 11.,r 
rps to murmur, yes, 
And shortly we were wed. 
A 
little cottage by the brook, 
And a 
tiny garden spot, 
Where grows a 
little flower called 
A

The fairest, sunniest summer 
That I 
shall ever know. 
Oft from this pale, dead blossom, 
I 
see a 
fair face start, 
A 
face like a 
sweet wild flower, 
Out of its faded heart.

Yet to me far dearer

Bringing me hack the June time

The fairest, sunniest summer 
That I

Only a

Faded, unlike the love 
That made that summer sweet; 
Still in this pansy blossom 
her tender face I

Frain under the churchyard grass 
Bringing her back to me. 
Ah! 'tis only, eta.

To show o his corsetted waist;

And every day you hear the girls say, 
"Oh! ain't ha quite a

Oh, ain't he, it.

DOES THY HEART BEAT TRUE TO MX 
Words and music by Miss MAUD BEVERLY. 
Does thy heart beat true to me, my lore, 
He said when last we met; 
His eyes they shone like stars above, 
Methinks I 
see them yet. 
My bosom heaved a 
tender sigh, 
I 
said where e'er you be, 
Remember love until I 
die. 
My heart beats true to thee. 
CHORUS. 
In the bilcut night, 
When the stars shine bright, 
And I 
am far across the sea. 
I'll ask thee loye. 
By the stars above, 
Does thy heart beat true to me. 
Does thy heart beat true to me, my love, 
For now we're going to part; 
And whilst the ocean wild I'll roam, 
Have I 
1 
loving heart. 
Remember Dear, when I'm not here, 
Your fancy will be free, 
And I 
shall say when far away, 
Does thy heart beat true to me.—Csto. 
Does thy heart beat true to me, my love, 
I'll ask when growing old ; 
And will it then be treasured truth, 
When age is wrinkled fold. 
With hair so white, and eyes less bright, 
And all things changed yon see, 
Remember then I'll ask again, 
Does thy heart beat true to me.—Crio.

For on a 
bright summer morning I 
pursued my way, 
As happy as a 
robin when he trills his lay, 
That morning such a 
letter from my true love came, 
Commencing with "My Dearest," and concluding with 
her name. 
Now who the letter came from I 
of course must tell, 
A 
charming little maiden, and her name is Belle, 
She is just as sweet as honey, and she writes to me— 
You see that we are parted, she is far across the sea. 
If you've ever been in love, of course you'll understand, 
The feelings of your heart, when loving letters reach your 
hand, 
How you'll stand and wonder what your sweetheart she 
has said, 
As I 
did, with the one that I 
have read. 
Of course I'm going to answer in a 
true love strain, 
And ask my little darling to return again, 
And soon a 
ship that's sailing o'er the dark blue sea, 
Will bring me such a 
letter, from my sweetheart it 
Then when we are married, I 
will write you all the news, 
Tell you how we get along, and never have the blues, 
What a 
little treasure wife I 
got from o'er the sea, 
Our letters then will spell L, 0, V, E.

As I

'Twas in the surnim-r time, 
I

And since rye called her mine; 
Some flowers she was bending o'er, 
I 
begged. of her a

The glance exchanged was one of love, 
Down where the pansies grew. 
CHORUS. 
And we whispered and we laughed so free, 
And, of course, we were happy tts could be, 
Oh, her smiles they are as bright as the rays 
Of the sun that loves the dew; 
Two hearts were moulded into one, 
Down where the pansies grew. 
The favor asked was but a 
bud, 
A 
rose that she possessed; 
The little flower love implied, 
And that I'd half confessed; 
Her cheeks were blushing like the leaf; 
In all its rosy hue; 
That evening I 
exchanged a 
kiss, 
Down where the pansies grew. 
And we whispered, eta. 
The flowers faded, but her love 
Remains as bright and green; 
And since the day I've called her mine, 
how happy we have been; 
So now the story I 
have told, 
In all its joys to you,

Mr. Finnegan invited his Mends, 
To come from near and far, 
And it wasn't long before they all got tight 
Mrs. Feeney she drank gin, 
When her husband he dropped in 
And saw Big Mike with his arm around her was% 
Just like a

Called Big Mike a 
thief; 
And they had it rough and tumble on the door, 
Omuta 
They played the fiddle and they pranced, 
It would make you laugh to see Big Mary dance, 
Balance down the middle, saesia across the floor, 
Such a 
happy lot of people I 
never saw before. 
Now, the supper it was elegant, 
The best I 
ever saw, 
They had clams and jams and several kinds of pies, 
They had mush in seven languages,: 
And the nicest shadow songs) 
About a 
bucketAll would nicely fill you up. 
The liquors were the best 
That old Finnegan he could but, 
His whiskey cost him seven cents a 
quart, 
And his cigars were imported 
From New Jersey's foreign shores, 
And they oast exactir sixteen cents a

THE WRECK OF THE PRINCESS ALI= 
Written and sung by Miss M AUD BETSRLY, 
She sailed from the shores of Sheerness, 
One eve of a 
bright autumn day; 
With one thousand souls, but few less, 
And all were so joyous and gay. 
As onward they steered towards home, 
They danced, and sang many a 
strain; 
Not thinking, while ploughing the foam, 
That few would their homes see again. 
CHORUS. 
Fearful to think of, sad to behold, 
Our eyes fill with tears, 
When the story is told; 
-We long shall remember 
Tbe third of September, 
And the wreck of the " Princess Alice." 
The people were never so gay, 
Of danger had never thought less; 
When, lo! there was heard with dismay, 
A crush, and a 
cry of distress. 
The laughter now turned to a 
shriek, 
All merriment changed into strife; 
And alm ost- before they could speak, 
ihey found themselves struggling for life. 
It was a 
sad picture of pain, 
'For near to their friends and their home, 
Six hundred were shrieking in vain, 
And struggling like mad ' midst the foam. 
Fond lovers to each other clasped, 
Sons, mothers, and fathers beside; 
And children, with toys tightly grasped, 
All sank ' neath the fast- running title. 
In this truly pitiful wreck, 
Some wildly their lives tried to save, 
While others remained on the deck 
Until she sank under the wave. 
And scarcely five minutes had passed, 
When such was her terrible doom; 
Then o'er her, the waters flowed fast, 
And nothing remained but the gloom.

Met near the stile together;

Good morning sweet Miss Grover" 
"The stile is awkward, take my hand 
And I

And then beside me walking, 
Began to talk, and what could I 
But listen to his talking.

Down among the Blue Bells, 
On that bright and sunny day. 
The birds were singing merry songs, 
Of love in leafy bowers, 
The butterflies and honey bees, 
Were sporting ' mid the flowers. 
The sky was cloudless blue above, 
The brook was running lightly, 
While through the trees, and o'er the flow'rs 
The breeze was playing lightly. 
And Robin still was by my side, 
And still the rogue was talking. 
I 
cannot tell you why it was, 
But still I 
kept on walking.--CaO.

THE OLD WOODEN -ROCKER. 
Words and music by FLORENCE HARPER. 
The Music of this song is published by SPEAR and Drew-

Price 40 cents. 
There it stsnds in the corner, with its back to the wall, 
The old wooden rocker 60 statety and tall! 
With naught to disturb it but the duster or broom, 
For no este now uses that back parlor room. 
Oh I 
how well I 
remember in days long gone by, 
When we stood by that rocker, nty sister and I, 
And we listen'd to the stories that our grandma would tan, 
By that old woodtc rocker we all loved so well. 
CHORUS. 
As she snt 
the fire she would rock, rock, rock, 
And we heard hut the tick of the old brass clock; 
Eighty years bud she sat in that chair grim and tall, 
in that old wooden rocker ! bat stands by the wall. 
If this chair could but speak, oh ! the tales it could tell,— 
[low poor aged grandpa in fierce battle fell: 
'Nesith the stars and the stripes he fought bravely and treak 
He cherished his freedom, the red, white and blue! 
It could tell of bright days awl of dark one beside, 
Of the day when dear grandma stood forth as a 
bride; 
rhi, is why we all love it, this old chair grim and tall, 
The old wooden rocker that stands by the wall. 
But poor grandma is gone, and her stories are done,— 
Her children have follow'd her, yes, one by one, 
They have all gone to meet her in the "sweet by-and-by," 
And all that is left is dear sister and I. 
Never more will we hide her gold specs, or her cap; 
Never more will we tease her while taking her nap; 
Never more will she slumber in that chair grim and tall, 
The old wooden ruukel ; La: , ta.pis by tilt; wall.

COLD STREAM GUARDS. 
Written and sung by Miss M AUD BEVERLY. 
At a 
military ball, a 
sergeant in the cold stream guards. 
Some time ago I 
did chance to meet, 
lie's the finest looking fellow that ever I 
had seen, 
And stood in height I'm sure about six feet. 
So handsome and so tall. I 
in love with him did fall, 
And as we went waltzing round what bliss, 
lie pressed me to his heart, 
Galled me his own Jam Tart, 
And when he said. be mine, • 
I 
answered, yes. 
cuonus. 
For my Charlie is a 
sergeant 
In the cold stream guards, 
lie is the man that can charm me, 
With his hat just on one side, 
And a 
military stride 
lie's the finest looking fellow 
In the army. 
You should see my Charlie on parade, 
Or see him in the park, 
The admiration of the girls is he, 
With chest expanded, head erect, 
He is my heart's delight, 
My Charlie he is all the world to me. 
On Sunday afternoon when we take a 
quiet stroll, 
And do a 
litt'e spooning, what a 
lark, 
The girls all look surprised, - 
With jealous envious eyes, 
They quiz us as we're strolling through the park, 
When the ball was over, 
lie begged to see me home, 
A 
favor that I 
could not well refuse, 
As he placed my arm in his, 
My heart was full of joy, 
For Charlie dear I 
should not like to lose. 
He spoke of future happiness, 
When I 
his wife should be, 
And when he sai i 
good bye at the door, 
He said be true to me, 
And I'll be true to thee, 
I 
know my Charlie will be to the core.

DON'T LEAVE YOUR MOTHER. 
Written and sung by Miss M AUD BEVERLY. 
How well do I 
remember, 
Though many years ago; 
I 
journeyed down td Plymouth, 
With my mother you must know. 
The ships were in the harbor, 
With flags and tanners dressed, 
And weeping wives and children, 
Were waiting with the rest. 
Alv father was a 
sailor, 
-On board a 
Man of War; 
Who once again was going, 
To " cave us bv the shore. 
He kissed our lips at parting, 
While standimr, on the quay; 
And as he bade us both goodbye, 
These word , he said to me: 
cnottus. 
Stick to ,- otir mother, Tom, 
When I 
am gone; 
Don't let her worry lad, 
Don't let her mourn. 
Remember that she nursed you, 
When I 
was far away; 
Don't leave your mother,1 
When her hair turns gray. 
Our hearts were 111111 and heavy, 
Returning 11 ,'Ine again; 
We scarcely spoke a 
whisper, 
Valle riling in the ti. n. 
The journey seemed onerding, 
And leaden was the sk.; 
Until we reqehel the station, 
Where home was Nery nigh 
The cottage 
kt 
And vacant iva 
Si'. et lir, 
In which my lather iingeted, 
When ever he was rear. 
I 
came and stood by mother, 
So full of iwpc Lind tame; 
She fondleti ; ifld 
me, 
As she whispered through her tears.—Cno. 
42 
DON'T LEAVE YOUR MOTHER.—Contirned 
The time rolled slowly onward, 
Many changes had occured; 
But of the good ship Victor, 
For months we had not heard. 
My mother grew so anxious, 
Her cheeks were sad and pale; 
And I 
was very fearful, 
She suddenly would fail. 
One day there came a 
telegram, 
To say the ship was lost; 
She'd foundered many miles away, 
When she'd been tempest tossed. 
My mother fainted at the news, 
But when the swoon had fled ; 
I 
kissed as I 
told her, 
Of the words my father said. 
CHORUS. 
Stick to your mother, Tom, 
When I 
am gone; 
Don't let her worry, lad, 
Don't let her mourn. 
Remember that she nursed you, 
When I 
was far away; 
Don't leave your mother, 
When her hair turns gray. 
She lingered through the summer, 
But when the frost and snow; 
The bitter winds of winter, 
Very quickly laid her low. 
She died in my embraces, 
With a 
spirit calm and brave; 
And now the weeping willow, 
Bend silently o'er her grave, 
I 
often go to see her grave, 
And keep the verdure green, 
And plant some spotless lily's, 
Upon the peaceful scene. 
And feel the satisfaction, 
Of knowing though she's dead; 
I 
tried to do my duty, 
To the words my father said.—CH0.

FORBIDDEN FRUIT. 
Written and sung by MANCHESTER and JXRIWITGIL 
Just at the time mother Eve she did climb 
The apple tree long ' fore the war, 
She threw down the core, though it made her feel eon 
For her hen-peeked husband to chaw. 
Without evil intention Adam made an invention, 
It was got up both simple and cute, 
And he thought to distill from an old-fashioned mill, 
The juice of the Forbidden Fruit. 
Now ever since then all manner of men, 
The deaf, dumb, blind and the mute, 
Our bankers and clerks, politicians and Turks, 
Drink the juice of the Forbidden Fruit. 
New, there's all our preachers and Sunday-school tonekonn 
Drink what they call sassafras root, 
Bat I 
bet all the same, if it had its right name, 
It's the juice of the Forbidden Fruit. 
There's Illy wife, Holly Ann, she takes out the este 
Whenever we have a 
dispute, 
We sit and we sup, as together we make up, 
Froze the juice of the Forbidden Fruit. 
When our leader has time, from his chair he will climb. 
And the gang they all follow suit— 
He will sneak to a 
bar, not for a 
cigar, 
But for juice of the Forbidden Fruit.

THE DANCING LOVER. 
Written and sung by Miss MAUD BEVERLIta.. 
Of all the plug,ues that ever I 
had, 
Enough to drive a 
girl quite mad, 
None before e'er bothered me so, 
As my restless dancing beau. 
When he came to visit us oft, 
I 
used to think the chap was soft, 
Then when he would caper away, 
Thus to him I 
used to say. 
CHORUS. 
Do be still, fidgety man, 
Do be still sir, if you can, 
Here and there, jigging about, 
Never at rest without a 
doubt, 
Up and down, round like a 
top, 
Here and there, hoppety hop, 
Dancing mad—so I 
should say, 
I 
wish you'd dance yourself away. 
He danced me here and he danced me therak, 
He danced me almost everywhere. 
Off we go to visit the Zoo, 
Opera, ball and concert too, • 
Picnic parties, * hen he would make, 
And all of us he used to take. 
Oh such antics with us he'd play, 
Till I 
felt compelled to say.--en0. 
He danced to pa and the question popped, 
lint pa his daneMg very soon stopped, 
13;nntly saying, "are you aware, 
I 
don't approve of a

As for marrying my girl Jane, 
Indeed you shan t, I

Six years ago come next Thursday night; 
At Castle Garden when the big ship landed, 
Oh I

As my friends received me so open handed, 
And " Weloome Dennis!" each one did cry. 
CHORUS.

'Tis an honest name which I'll never deny,

In the old Fourth Ward I 
have gained renown, 
And I've raised myself to a 
high position 
By the votes I 
own in that part of town. 
The resolutions of our ward meetings 
Are framed by me, for I've lots of lore, 
And the bosses say, each with friendly greeting, 
That I'm a 
credit to old Erin's shore. 
Arrah! Dennis Dacia; an

was selected 
For a 
magistrate, out of twenty-three 
And I'm proud to say that I

To take my seat I 
was well contented, 
But I 
was not proud of my high degree— 
By admiring friends I 
was then presented 
With this diamond pin that you see on me. 
Arrah Dennis Doolan, Ms. 
With the Fourth Ward ladies I'm quite a 
darling, 
For my claims to beauty are by all allowed, 
But although I'm flattered from night till morning, 
It doesn't make me a 
damn bit proud. 
rn say, adieu, for it don't become me 
To tarry longer than I 
really can;. 
My friends expect better things now from me 
Since I've been elected an Alderman!

THE KICKING MULE. 
Written by Gus. Peters for CAVA/TA and MA.enza, 
I 
know a 
little kicking man, 
His name is Simon Slick, 
He's got a 
mule with dreamy eyes 
And how that mule would kick; 
He'd wag his tail and wink his eye, 
And greet you with a 
smile, 
And gently telegraph his leg 
And raise you half a 
mile. 
CEO 
a 
This mule was a 
kicker, 
He'd raise you up slicker, 
And knock you down quicker 
Than dizzy had liquor; 
he'd eat like a 'nicker, 
A hungry bill sti k . r, 
A knocker no quicker 
Could ever be found. 
This mule was a 
daisy, 
he'd pulverize a 
hog; 
Dissected seven Chinamen 
And mashed a 
yellow dog; 
He'd kick as quick as lightning 
For he had an iron jaw, 
He was just the thing to have around

PURTY PAT. THE MASHER.. 
Written and sung by PAT. ROONEY. 
purty Pat. the masher, 
They say my photograph 
Looks so very handsome 
It makes a 
jackass laugh. 
Some think I'm Roscoe Conkling 
When I 
swell out my chest, 
You'd think I'd a 
bale of cotton 
Stuffed inside my vest. 
Brorrm—I'd be happy, only Pm married to a 
red-
headed jealous wife. 
The other evening as meself and the 
Jersey Lilly were drinking caster oil ba liga rue at Delmonias 
R7 wife rushed in, grabbed me by the hair and said: 
CHORUS. 
I've caught you Patsy, 
You can't fool Mary Ann, 
Its queer tricks you're playing 
For an ould married man. 
Come home and rock the cradle, 
You know the twins are sick, 
Or I'll crack your thick skull 
With the soft end of a 
brick, 
When I 
go to Coney island 
And put on a 
bathing suit, 
I 
look like an alligator, 
And me they try to shoot. 
If I 
see a 
putty lady 
Swimming on the beach! 
How to swim liLe a 
porpoise 
Tbe lady I

SPDXEN.—As 
I 
was teaching my lady friend, the grand 
Duchess of Hoboken, how to go into the water without 
getting wet, I 
saw what I 
supposed was a 
bag of rags 
lasting toward me. 
It was my wife. 
She caught me 
and held my head under the water for four hours, and as 
soon as she let me up, she said:

There's an old fashioned home that is not far away,

There's an old wooden pump by the side of the gat% 
And a 
sweet lilac tree scents the air. 
There's an old-fashioned woman that always smiles 
As she watches the sweet mountain rose, 
She's an old-fashioned cap on her snowy white head 
And she's dressed in the old style of clothes. 
CHORUS. 
Listen to those sweet bells, 
My

Listen to those sweet bells, 
In the old-fashioned church on the kilL 
There's an old fashioned clock on the old mantle pin% 
With its long swinging pendlum and hands, 
There's a 
large wooden bench by the old &opium, 
And the broom in the corner it stands; 
there's a

And he smokes his long treasured pipe,

OH AINT IT FINE. 
Written and sung by Miss M AUD BEVERLY.. 
I 
courted the Princess, 
My love I 
can't repress. 
No damsel could equal my darling sweet. 
Her eyes are gems of light, 
Her face is fair and bright, 
Her voice as that of any starting. 
I 
love her, yes I 
love her, 
No Pen i 
is above her, 
And I'm resolved her hand to obtain. 
And every morn and night, 
She is my heart's delight, 
And I 
take her for a 
ramble down the lane, 
CHORUS. 
Oh :tint it fine, isn't it divine, 
Oh aint it proper, aint it nice, 
Courting down the lane, 
With my Julia and my Jane, 
You feel as though you were in paradise. 
Among girls I 
chance to roam, 
Abroad, also at home, 
And favored -
I've ever been by beauty. 
Flirtation was an art, 
in which I 
played my part, 
To worship pretty woman is a 
duty. 
They term me captivating, 
indeed the truth I'm stating, 
I 
am sure the Princess will say so to. 
I'm sure she will not snub, 
This dandy for her hub, 
And I'm determined that I 
will woo.

IS YOUR MAMMA WELL. 
Published by E. H. HARDING, 229 Bowery, N.

itten and composed for Miss KATIE COOPER by Crtanzme 
CONNOLLY, author and composer of "Dancing in the 
Dreamy Waltz," "Twilight Coterie," "Levi 
Kassiday," " Waltz with me," etc. 
There's a 
fellow so simple who mils upon me, 
Who thinks he's surprisingly clever, 
To be posted on every expression that's new, 
Is always his eager endeavor. 
"Are you going very far?" "Yes I 
are," "Well, ta, 
And such brilliant nonsense he mutters. 
But of late he has caught something crazier still. 
And this is the question he utters : 
CHORUS. 
Is your mamma well, baby, is your mamma vet, 
it 
Health of papa good, daisy, is your papa cheerffil, tell, 
And your sister is she very bright, brother, too, is he all 
right ? 
And again, love, are you quite sure your mamma's well ? 
In the talk of the day he's a 
genius indeed, 
For certainly none could be wiser, 
Not a 
thing that occurs but he's sure to insist, 
Was "all on account of Eliza." 
"Not this eve!" "Well, good-eve I" he so quickly did learn 
When "What, never I" he had to smother, 
Are you going to the ball, love, this evening?" came nert, 
With its answer, "Not this, but some other." 
Srotraw,—He's a 
regular dictionary of popular slang, 
He snows all about "jays, gillys, freshes, gawks, rubes, 
terrors, daisies," and other curiosities, and talks about 
"Shooting dicers, Taking tumbles, Bracing main guys,* and 
"Going to the hall this evening, or, some other, no other, 
this other, or any other, good evening" until he erases me. 
And now he makes matters worse by asking me, 
Is your mamma well, eta.
