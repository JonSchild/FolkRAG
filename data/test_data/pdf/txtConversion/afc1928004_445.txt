Dan Collyer's Bull Dog, 
Written by Sam DEVERE, and surg with great success by DAN COLLYER. 
Old Dan Collyer had a 
bull dog, 
lie was bred of the good old stock ; 
For twenty-seven hours a 
battle he fought— 
I'm telling you the truth by the clock. 
His tail was a 
neat little bit of a 
stump, 
Bow-legged, with two crooked eyes ; 
One look of his little pug nose was enough, 
He was the devil himself in disguise. 
He had all the neighbors crazy, so he did, 
With his treacherous, villainous tricks; 
They tried for to kill him with pistols and guns, 
And they flung at him thousands of bricks. 
A murdering villain he was, to be sure, 
His equal there never was found, 
For he took Mr. Kelly's pig by the ear, 
And he dragged him all over the ground. 
He tore all the tails off my Sunday coat, 
Eat the bustle off Mary Ann Finn, 
And he run betwixt young Kitty Mulligan's lecr.. 
Now wasn't that truly a 
sin ? 
He caught up the little Dutch shoemaker's dog, 
And he shook him around like a 
rat; 
He murdered McMulligan's beautiful goat, 
And he eat up Mrs. Hennessy's cat. 
A man entered a 
well-known restaurant the other day and 
called for a 
dinner. 
His orders were of the most elaborate 
character, and fairly staggered the resources of even so noted 
a ' restaurant keeper. 
He lingered long at the table, and 
finallyiwound .up with a 
bottle of wine. 
Then lighting a 
cigar he ordered, he leisurely sauntered up to the counter, 
and said to the proprietor: 
"Very fine dinner, landlord! 
Just charge it 
to me. 
I 
haven't got a 
cent." 
" 
But I 
don't know you," said the proprietor, indignantly. 
" 
Of course you don't. 
If you had, you wouldn't have let 
me had the dinner." 
" 
Pay me for the dinner, I 
say." 
"And I 
say I 
can't. 
Haven't got the blunt." 
" 
I'll see about that," said the proprietor, somewhat furious 
at the bill. 
Then he snatched a 
revolver from the drawer 
and leaped over the counter, collared the man, exclaiming, as 
he pointed it at his head : 
" 
Now see if you'll get away with that dinner without pay-
ing for it, you scoundrel." 
"What is that you hold in your hand ?" said the getter-
away-with-free- dinners, drawing back. 
" 
That is a 
revolver, sir." 
"Oh, that's a 
revolver, is it. 
I 
don't care a 
pin for a 
re-
volver. 
I 
thought it was a 
stomach-pump." 
I DO not remember to have seen any epitaph in which a 
man's virtues are more concisely stated than that upon the 
tate Mr. Cut Mink: 
" 
The angels to-night, in theit mansions of light, 
Are waltzing around Anthony Mink ; 
He was faithful and kind as any you'll find, 
And gin was his favorite drink." 
Biddy Muldoon. 
As sung with great success by DAN COLLYER. 
Now, Biddy, I 
see you a-peepin' so sly, 
The stars are a- looking from out of the sky, 
The nightingale warbles his purtiest tune, 
He knows I 
am lovin' you, Biddy Muldoon. 
The grass it is wet, and I'm catchin' a 
cold, 
And, Biddy, now don't you be thinking me bold, 
Just open the dure and I'll go away soon, 
For I'm crazy wid love of you, Biddy Muldoon. 
Biddy, Biddy, Biddy Muldoon, 
Open the window and look at the moon ; 
I'd knock any man in the middle of June, 
If I 
caught him a 
courtin' you, Biddy Muldoon. 
Now, Biddy, my darlin, you're laughing, I'm sure, 
Oh come down, my jewel, and open the dure; 
Would you let a 
man fraze, on an evenin' in June, 
When you could revive him, dear Biddy Muldoon. 
If the old man's awake, bless the name that he bears, 
He'd think it's a 
rat, that is stealing up stairs ; 
'Twould be a 
good joke on the swate old gossoon, 
For he won't know I'm courtin' you, Biddy Muldoon. 
Biddy, Biddy, Biddy Muldoon, &c.

A 
Contradiction. 
" 
The mill will never grind again 
With the water that has past." 
A 
maxim of the olden time 
That will forever last. 
This theme, in verses written. 
Preaches a 
sermon to all ; 
But critically weighed with wisdom, 
How does the lesson fall ? 
The mill upon a 
slope cloth stand, 
it bears an antique shape ; 
Waters from the mountain-land 
Seem happy to escape, 
And, rushing by the old mill's wheel, 
- 
Causing it to grind. 
Bound madly on the vale beyond, 
A 
level there to find. 
The race now o'er, with calmness 
Into a 
lake the water flows, 
And, mingling with the tranquil flood, 
Seeks peace in sweet repose. 
The bright sunbeams then visiting 
This realm to Somnus given, 
The tiny globes in vapors rise 
To space above in heaven. 
Once in air, they congregate, 
Fantastic clouds to be, 
And, wafted by the summer breeze, 
Float off most gracefully. 
Soon the mountain tops are reached, 
Ere they cling for rest; 
Each rugged peak is hid from view, 
Each in vapor dressed. 
At morn the clouds would fain ascend, 
And leave this dreary plain ; 
But, chilled through by the frigid air, 
Condensed, they fall in rain. 
As the pearly drops alight, 
They dance about with glee, 
For are they not of earth again, 
Just as they used to be? 
They prance, they skip, and race along, 
O'er pebbled brook and rill— 
When lo! they reach familiar ground, 
And pass the same old mill. 
In doing so they turn the wheel, 
With sparkling spray o'ercast, 
Thus proving that the mill does grind 
With water that has past. 
Philosophically the lesson's taught, 
Bidding us beware, 
Although a 
chance unheeded pass, 
Not to incite despair. 
Labor on with redoubled zeal, 
Lost hours to redeem, 
And teach your conscience thus to feel, 
That things are what they seem. 
Opportunities appearing lost, 
And numbered with the slain, 
By providential agencies 
Will surely come again. 
Now bear in mind, although the Fates 
Your hopes continually blast, 
Kind Nature's mill will grind again 
With watei that has past. 
The Fairy's Dream. 
Written and Composed by DAN COLLVER. 
They say that in the moonlit dell, 
That still the fairies come ; 
That many a 
tale of love they tell, 
When from the dance they roam. 
They say one little fairy maid 
From words such rapture drew, 
That she slumbered in the glade, 
She dreamt the heart was true. 
CHORUS. 
She dreamt the heart was true, 
Oh, sweet the moon did beam, 
And sweet the star, 
As though it knew the little fairy's dream. 
How pleasant in a 
moonlit dell— 
The busy world afar— 
To slumber ' neath a 
happy spell, 
\Vhile shines the morning star. 
Our hearts are much the same, they say, 
As full of joy they seem ; 
When happy as the little fay, 
We dream the fairies' dream. 
CHORUS. 
We dream the heart is true, 
Oh, sweet the moon did beam, 
And sweet the star, 
As though it knew the little fairy's dream. 
Farewell. 
The last tie is severed that bound me to thee, 
The struggle is over, and now I 
am free ; 
I 
have loved thee so fondly no language could tell, 
So proudly and coldly I 
bid thee " Farewell." 
The conflict is over. I've conquered at last, 
No longer in sadness I 
muse on the past ; 
To my joy I 
have conquered, the conflict is o'er, 
So proudly I 
tell thee I 
love thee " no more." 
You may go and be happy—ne'er think of the past, 
You have slighted a 
love that could love to the last; 
You may now pass me by with that cold smile of yore, 
But proudly I 
tell thee I 
love thee " no more." 
I 
bid thee forget me, wherever thou art, 
Though thoughts of my first love may cling to my heart, 
When friends shall prove false, and fortune decline, 
Thou wilt sigh for the love that no longer is thine. 
WliEN you see a young couple late at night on the lake 
bank, chewing, biting, and eating each other, just let ' em 
alone. 
They are only fooling. 
A HUSBAND got angry with his wife and locked her up. 
At dinner time, to mortify her, he sent her a 
bone by his son. 
The little fellow knocked at the door, saying : " Mother, 
father says here is a 
bone for you to pick." " Tell him he's 
not your father, and there's a 
bone for him to pick,"

Nuff ced." 
Written and Composed by BILL DEVERE, and recited with rounds of ap-
plause by DAN COLLYER. 
Oh the snow, the beautiful snow„ 
That flies in your face wherever you go, 
That's twisted and twirled in the dreary street, 
Till it blinds your poor eyes and freezes your feet. 
Its all very fine, this " beautiful snow," • 
If you've a 
blunt in your pocket, and somewhere to go ; 
But the poet was born in the summer, I 
know, 
That finds something pretty in " beautiful snow." 
Beautiful, is it ? 
Humph, " beautiful snow." 
The thermometer just three degrees below, 
Your " benjareir hocked :" 
not a 
cent in your " hick," 
And " beautiful snow " till you can't see a 
brick 
In the sidewalks around in a 
dreary town, 
And that beautiful snow is still coming down. 
If I 
had a 
room with a 
fire all aglow, 
I 
could envy the " Guy " that wrote " Beautiful Snow." 
Beautiful, is it ? " Beautiful snow,' 
When it falls on a 
sinner with nowhere to go. 
It seems to me now (I'm a 
practical man, 
And no lovesick damsel or innocent lamb ; 
Therefore it cannot be expected, you know, 
To stand on my head about " beautiful snow." 
It seems to me, though) that the Foet should go 
And bury himself in his " beautiful snow." 
"Beautiful snow from the heavens above. 
Pure as an angel, gentle as love." 
I 
wish they would keep it in heaven, not throw 
So much down on earth of that " beautiful snow.' 
" 
Gentle as love," how can they say so ? 
See how it sticks ; it never will go ; 
March, April, May might come and might go, 
And still we'd be blest with that " beautiful snow." 
flow to Catch a 
Plea. 
As described by DAN COLLYER. 
Don't be in a 
hurry and get frantic. 
Watch your chance, 
Take a 
two- foot rule and measure the distance from your 
hand to the flea. 
Take your pencil and calculate the time it 
will take to pass your hand that distance, so you may be sure. 
Take a 
long breath. 
Aim to grab his hind leg. 
Nerve your-
self up, take a 
drink, make a 
ferocious grab, and if the flea 
strays off, continue the chase around the room until you 
tumble over the baby ; then flee. 
Coolness. 
AT 
the theatre, one night, John Phoenix thought he saw an 
acquaintance sitting a 
few feet in front, and asked the gentle-
man between them to poke him with his cane. 
When he 
turned around John discovered his mistake. 
Fixing his at-
tention on the play, and affecting indifference of the whoie 
affair, he left the man with the cane to settle tho disturbance, 
and he, being wholly without an excuse, there was, of COUr:',:, 
a ludicrous and embarrassing scene, during all of whicit 
Phcenix was profoundly interested in the play. 
At last tl. 
man asked, indignantly : " Did you tell me to poke that 
with my stick ?" " Yes." " And what did you want?" 
wanted to see whether you would poke him or not." 
" 
You LIE !" 
The tone was deep and sincere, 
Yet scarce had the words been spoken 
Ere a 
bludgeon and cranium met and embraced, 
And the Sixth Commandment is broken.

Extract from " Fits," 
DAN COLLVER'S GREAT ACT. 
One of the first prisoners under examination was a 
youth, 
who had been arrested at the instance of a 
respectable negro 
man of family, for having " rocked" his house and severely 
injured his daughter with a 
stone thrown through the window. 
At the examination Old Pompey was put upon the stand, and 
proved the charge in such undeniable terms that it would 
have gone bard with the prisoner had it not been for the fol-
lowing cross-examination : 
LAWYER—You say one gtone came into the morn where 
you were sitting with your family, and struck your daughter ? 
POMP— Yes, boss, 
LAWYER—Where did it strike her? 
POMP (
silent for awhile)--I 
don't like to tell, boss. 
LAWYER—But you must tell. 
I 
eemand again, Where did 
it strike her ? 
POMP—Dat all foolishness, boss. 
I 
tell you it hit her. 
I 
don't like to tell where ' fore dese people in court. 
LAWYER— But you must answer. 
Where did it hit her ? 
POMP (SIOWI 
y)—On the buzzum, boss. 
LAW 
YER —.Well, how severely did it injure her? 
POMP—Oh, quit dis foolishnes.. I 
ain't gwine to tell. 
LAWYER—Again I 
must insist upon my question being 
answered. 
Did it injure her? 
POMP in despair)—No, sah ! 
It did not injure ber, but it 
broke three Singers of a 
gentleman that was payin' ' tention 
to her.

The Policeman. 
Written and composed by DAN COLLYER. 
A song for the guards of the city, 
The men who are gallant and true; 
Their praises I 
sing in this ditty— 
The stalwart, the brave men in blue. 
They never will swerve from their duty, 
But danger they keep from our doors, 
The gallant protectors of beauty, 
The shield of our rights and our laws. 
CHoluts. 
Then, hurrah! for the guards of the city. 
The men who are gallant ond true ; 
Their praises we sing in this ditty— 
Hurrah ! for the brave men in blue. 
When stealthily, under night's cover, 
The house-breaker creeps to your door, 
And thinks that he'll pick a 
fat plover 
While the inmates in sweet slumbe.• snore, 
The night guardian strikes him with \vondel-. 
For, just as he's bagging his game, 
The arm of the law grabs the plunder 
And the robber is brought to his shame. 
T:ten, 
Then, long life to the gallant battali,.; 
The marshal. the captain, and all, 
The terror of thief and ra;callion, 
And willing to answer the cal. 
When danger's at hand, they are ready 
To rush to the front and to shielJ; 
Stout hearts, with a 
steD firm and sleady, 
Will soon drive the foe from the field. 
Then hurrah, & c. 
As recited by DAN COLLYER. 
You may get through the world, but ' twill be very slow, 
If you listen to all that is said as you go ; 
You'll be worried, and fretted, and kept in a 
stew, 
For meddlesome tongues will have something to do, 
For people will talk. 
If you're quiet and modest, you'll have it presumed 
That your humble position is only assumed ; 
Vou're a 
wolf in sheep's clothing, or else you're a 
fool, 
But don't get excited, keep perfectly cool, 
For people vill talk. 
If generous and noble, they'll vent out their spleen, 
You'll hear some loud hints that you're selfish and mean 
1!- 
upright and honest, as fair as the day, 
The:'11 call you a 
rogue in a 
sly, sneaking way, 
For 7
-,eole will talk.

A TIMID man wants to know " how to tell a mad dog." 
[I don't know what he wants to tell him, but the safest way 
would be to communicate v.-ith the dog- in writing.] 
A 
Dog For Sale. 
A story told by D AN :COLLYER. 
It does not make any difference whether your name is 
Keyser or not; if you want to buy a 
dog, there is one for sale 
cheap on a 
canal boat, now braying the billows somewhere 
east of Frankfort. 
The captain of the boat is an Oswego 
man, and it is but one short week since he spliced the main-
brace, and let out the reefs in his driver, and got three sheets 
in the wind and made all necessary preparations for a 
pros-
perous voyage. 
His wife sang, " Write me a 
letter, love, ' in 
the cabin, his children played on deck, his steeds aired their 
frames on the tow-path, his hand was on the rudder, and his 
mate was just recovering from his farewell attack of delirium 
tremens in the forward cabin. 
The captain gazed proudly 
around him, and could think of nothing else to complete his 
happiness ; but his wife, wiser than him, thought they needed 
a 
dog—a 
nice Newfoundland to play with the children, fish 
them out when they fell in the canal, and watch the deck 
hands when the captain was off after groceries. 
Coming through West Utica recently, the captain bought a 
nice Newfoundland dog. 
He got him at a 
bargain ; in fact 
he got him for nothing, so to speak, because the man who 
owned the dog was not around when the bargain was made. 
The captain had the dog, but still he was not happy. 
The 
dog had a 
way of barking at passing crafts, and so drew upon 
his captain's boat frequent showers of coal and stove wood, 
and he would dive down the steep cabin steps suddenly and 
upset tu captain's wife. 
Once he lit on the table and spoiled 
a 
pound of butter, in fact he was altogether too playful. 
The captain, who is a 
pious man, tied up and put out his 
plank just east of the city, and started with his children to go 
to the Park, to observe the day, after the manner of this 
18 
vicinity. 
The dog started, too, and as soon as he got on 
shore he began to caper and wag his tail, and so wagged one 
of the blessed children flat on its back. 
The baby yelled, 
and the captain made some tender remark as he set it on its 
precious feet, and some other remarks as he shook his fist at 
the dog. 
The dog misunderstood the man and came running 
back full of fun and made a 
jump to lick his face. 
He missed 
the man but he knocked the other child into the canal, and 
the father, without waiting to make any remarks, jumped in 
after it. 
The dog, being to the water born, knew just what 
to do, and he went cavorting off to get a 
good headway, bark-
ing to himself at every jump, and just as the man got to the top 
of the water with the darling child, the dog took a 
flying leap 
of about twenty feet, and struck on the top of the man. 
Well, 
the water that man spurted around was boiling hot with the 
oaths he sputtered with it, and his wife pranced around on 
the deck of the boat, and flung a 
pole to the old man, which 
the dog promptly dragged and pulled ashore, and that captain 
was nearly drowned before he trod the sod again. 
The dog is an intelligent animal—very intelligent indeed— 
and just as soon as he saw that mariner's face, he knew that 
something was wrong, so he slunk up the plank on board. 
The captain gathered what loose granite and lumber he could 
in a 
hurried but earnest search, and marched up the plank, the 
grimmest figure of Neptune ever done in Mohawk Valley mud. 
As soon as he got aboard, he opened a 
hot fire on the dog, and 
that sagacious brute went yelping thr,Dugh the forward hatch, 
and struck in the bunk, where the mac lay musing about the 
devil. 
When the mate saw the dog, he thought the evil one had 
come for him sure enough, and he braced himself for one lat 
fight, so that when the captain jumped down in the pursuit of 
the dog, there was a 
mutual misunderstanding all around. 
The captain's wife looked down and tried to explain, but 
there was a 
confused whirlpool of bunk boards and hair and 
bedding, and legs and arms, with an occas:$ional infusion cf 
dog, but it seemed idle to waste her breath in talking to such 
a 
circus. 
To-day the bow of that fatal craft cuts the waters solemnly, 
and at the helm stands the wreck of that captain, fastened 
together with strips of plaster and smelling of liniment, and 
ever and anon he surrenders the rudder to his wife, while he 
goes forward to hammer a 
dejected dog, which is for sale, or 
to listen to the ravings of a 
maniac confined under the forward 
hatch. 
Composition on a 
Wheelbarrow. 
hv DAN COLINER. 
If you have occasion to use a 
wheelbarrow, leave it, when 
you are through with it, in front of the house, with the handles 
toward the door. A wheelbarrow is the most complicated 
thing to fall over on the face of the earth. 
A man would fall 
over one when he would never think of falling over anything 
else. 
He never knows when he has got through falling over 
it, either ; for it will tangle his legs and his arms, turn over 
with him and rear up in front of him, and just as he pauses 
in his profanity to congratulate himself, it takes a 
new turn 
and scoops more skin off him, and he commences to evolute 
anew, and bump himself on fresh places. 
A man never 
ceases to fall over a 
wheelbarrow until it turns completely on 
its back, and brings up against something it cannot upset. 
It 'is the most inoffensive looking object there is, but it is 
more dangerous than a 
locomotive, and no man is secure 
with one, unless lie has tight hold of its handles, and is sitting 
down on something. A wheelbarrow has its uses, without a 
doubt, but in its leisure moments it is the great blighting 
curse on true dignity.

The Tables Turned. 
As told amid roars of laughter by DAN COLLYER. 
When I 
used to tend store in Baltimore, the old man came 
around one day, and says he : " Boys, the one that sells the 
most ' twixt now and Christmas, gets a vest pattern for a 
present." 
May be we didn't work for that vest pattern! I 
tell you there were some tall stories told in praise of goods 
just about that time ; but the tallest talker and the one that 
had more cheek than any of us, was a 
certain Jonah Squires. 
who roomed with me. 
Ile could take a 
dollar out of a 
man's 
pocket when the man only intended to spend a 
sixpence ; 
and the women— Lord bless you !— they just handed over 
their pocket books to him and let him lay out what he liked 
for them. 
One night Jonah woke me up with, " By Jove. old 
fellow, if you think that ' ere's got any cotton in it, I'll bring 
down the sheep that it was cut from, and make him swear to 
his wool ! ' TWon't wear out, neither ; wore a 
pair of pants of 
that stuff for five years, and they are as good now as when I 
first put 'em on. 
Take it at thirty cents and I'll say you don't 
owe me anything. 
Eh ! too dear? Well, call it twenty-eight 
cents. What dye say ? Shall I 
tear it ? All right, it's a 
bargain." 
I 
could feel Jonah's hand playing around the bed clothes for a 
minute, then rip ! tear ! went something or other, and I 
hid 
my head under the blankets, perfectly convulsed with laughter, 
and sure that Jonah had torn the best sheet from top to bot-
tom. 
When I 
awoke next morning I 
found—alas! unkindest 
cut of all !—that the back of my night shirt was split from 
tail to collar-band. 
TOM BELL, in Dilk's bar room, fell out with Jack Hess, 
When Jack, who's a 
jovial elf, 
Anointed his brow with an axe that lay near, 
And promptly surrendered himself.

Pat McCoy. 
Written and composed by DAN COLLYER. 
My name is Paddy McCoy, 
I'm a 
true- born Irishman; 
I 
love my adopted country, 
And do for her all I 
can. 
I've not very long been over, 
But I'm smart enough at that, 
Though whenever I 
go to take a 
walk 
The boys will holler " Pat," 
CHORUS. 
Oh, Paddy McCoy, from where did you come, 
You're a 
regular Irish mick ; 
Look at the flannel- mouth son-of-a-gun, 
And gaze on his blackthorn stick. 
In politics I'm a 
leading man, 
In the Fourth Ward I 
reside; 
I 
elect my men again and again, 
And with the boys the sugar divide. 
When any man wants an office, 
To me he is certain to come, 
I 
will send him there as sure as fate, 
If he planks down a 
good round sum. 
Oh, Paddy McCoy, & c. 
So, if any of you wants to be Governor, 
Come and have a 
chat with me, 
And if we can come to arrangements 
Why, Governor you surely will be ; 
For the boys I 
must treat to lager, 
And cigars and whiskey too; 
Now, what wealth do you think you'll stand ? 
Just say a 
thousand or two. 
Oh, Paddy McCoy, & c.

Funnygraphs, 
NEVER interfere with a 
policeman in the discharge of his 
pistol. 
NOT every one can tell when hot weather is coming. 
Some err. 
THERE is nothing in the world which keeps Lent so well as 
an umbrella. 
M AN glories in his strength ; woman glories in her hair ; 
butter glories in both. 
THERE are 3,064 languages spoken, and a 
man feels like 
using all of them when he sits down on a 
cat. 
I 
CAN not find time to sing the song sent me, beginning, 
" 
Fill up with wine your flowing bowels." 
The spelling is 
not correct. 
"ARE there any fools in this town ?" asked a 
stranger of a 
newsboy, recently. " I 
don't know," replied the boy; " why, 
are you lonesome ?" 
DAN COLLYER says he once prevented a 
severe case of hydro-
phobia by simply getting on a 
high fence, and sitting there 
for two hours and a 
half, until the dog had gone away. 
PETER QUIGG, entertaining some serious doubts 
Of his consort's connubial devotion, 
Took an arsenic lunch, then indulged in a 
dive 
In eternity's fathomless ocean. 
A GOOD way to restore a man apparently drowncd is to 
first dry him thoroughly, inside and out, and then clap a 
speaking trumpet to his car and inform him that his mother-
in-law's dead. 
TIIE most interesting part of a 
man's life occurs when he 
watches a 
woman get over the fence. 
First she looks to see 
if anybody is watching her. 
Then she gathers her skirts 
around her, and the man wonders if she will hop over. 
She 
then takes another look and—crawls ut.J.Q. the fence.

Add Ryman's Celebrated 4th of July Oration. 
It is useless and more than foolish to enter into prefatory 
remarks explanatory of the origin, growth and pedigree of the 
Fourth of July. 
That it was born of poor and honest parents, 
is a 
fact known Lo us all. 
That it's birth gave us freedom there 
,:an he no doubt. 
That that freedom inspired us with enter-
prise and industry make no blooming error 
That industry 
and enterprise has made us the greatest nation the sun ever shone 
on, you can bet your bottom dollar. 
And in how short a 
time? 
How rapid have been the strides of improvement. 
Rivers that 
but yesterday rolled from the icy north to the tropical south, 
whose 6urfaces were only disturbed by the Indian's canoe, to-
day are full of llat-boats and stern- wheel-steamers. 
In the Ian-
olutelt 
ol the Poet— 
Behind the redman's bark canoe, 
The steamboat putts and raves, 
And city lots are advertised for sale, 
Above old Indians' graves. 
Hey! 
Where was this ,:it' two hundred years ago? 
Where was it? 
Was it where she now stands ? No, my hearers. it was not. But 
on this spot the war-whom)) or the Indian chief might have been 
heard to echo and reecho trom Woodbine Cottage to the Jersey 
Ferry. 
But where is the war-whoop now ? 
It has passed into 
the dim distance, and to- day as you walk down Broadway 
instead of being greeted with the war- whoop of the Indian 
chief, all you hear is: 
how is the old thing working? 
But 
we know how it is ourselves. 
We know that, as a 
people 
we are huge. 
We have everything to be proud of. 
We have 
a 
President that can smoke more cigars, make longer excur-
sions and shorter speeches, catch more trout and allow the 
American Flag to ask more apologies than any other ruler on 
the face of tin earth. 
We have men in our halls of Congress 
who would sacrifice their lives rather than rob t 
he government of 
anything 
They couldn't get away with, and if we keep on 
progressing as we have been in the last few years, there will be 
nothing left of the Old Constitution but the Freedmen's Bureau, 
Woman's Suffrage and the 15th Amendment. 
Ain't we huge? 
I 
tell you we're business. We're the most peaceful when abused 
and the most warlike when let alone of any people on the earth. 
We had a 
standing challenge in the Clipper for years and years. 
No nation took it up, so we took it up ourselves. 
We had a 
fight in our own family just to show outsiders how we could 
make the fur fly. 
But the cruel was is over and how our hearts 
beat with joy, our bosoms heaved with emotion to see our 
brothers and friends after their long, tedious marches and hard 
fought battles, returning home 
from Canada. 
Yes, my friends, the war is over and the Star Spangled Banner 
still floats triumphant. 
We still celebrate the Anniversaryof 
the Declaration of Independence. 
And the bald-headed eagle 
Ins perched himself on the snow-capped summits of the Mocky 
Rountains, flaming his wings, spreading his tail feathers, bid-
ding defiance to the world and spiling for a 
muss. 
But he'll 
never spite, he's not long to wait. 
We are on the eve of a 
great war, which if not stopped will cause rivers of blood to 
flow. 
I 
fancy I 
hear you asking yourselves, what will cause 
this war? I 
will tell you, 
During the last three years there 
has Leen more emigration to this country than there has been 
during the last thre years. 
Scarcely a ship arrives but that 
irings froni twenty-five to one hundred Italian organ g,inders, 
sent to this country by Italy to make harmony between the two 
,-,reat nations, but how are they treated, how are Italians treat. 
ed in this country? Calumniously. Have we commissioners at • 
pointed to show them : Town], to take them by the hand and 
ruzini them against the piLfalls and allurements that beset their 
path to lead them astray ? 
No, in 
No 
Why it was only 
two days, three weeks and four months ago that an Italian 
friend of mine, an organ-grinder by profession, landed in this 
your beautiful city of New York. how was he received ? Who 
was there to take him by the hand and show him round among 
25 
the gangs 
Noboby, not even " Nobody's Daughter ' 
What 
was the consequences? 
He stood grinding his organ three 
days end three nights, in front of a 
Deaf and Dumb Asylum. Its 
enough to bust up any business. 
And it is likely to cause war 
between this country and Italy. 
Let us prevent it, " Let us 
have peace," for, as Gen. Grant says, the country is in no con-
dition to fight and he wouldn't say so unless he wa.3 paid for 
it. 
But I'll detain you no longer, hoping you may all live for 
mittmy years to fire your crackers and shout for the " Star Ban-
glen Smasher." The Fourth of July and the Dec---le—pru—dence 
ot In—dig—na—tion. I 
bid you a-jew, a-----streetjew.

An Address to an Old Wooden Pipe. 
Sung by MILES MMUS. 
SO they say your a 
villain old friend, 
That you rob me of sleep and of sense, 
r0 ruin my strength that you tend, 
And walk off with my hardly earn'd pence. 
That you lead to late hours and bad ways, 
And encourage a 
taste for strong drink, 
One friend in particular says, 
Without hesitation you stink 
That you are not a 
beauty I 
fear, 
An old blackened tube at the best; 
Your odor—decidedly queer, 
And you'r seldom if ever at rest. 
I 
do take a 
glass when I 
smoke, 
Especially after I've dined; 
And my friends are most welcome to croak 
if it any-way eases their mind. 
I 
think I 
with safety may state 
That you have cost me fourpence a 
days 
That I 
sometimes have sat up too late 
And smoked you whilst losing at play, 
Still those fourpence I 
well can afford, 
They make no great bole in my purse ; 
And I 
really don't think, on my word, 
That the smoke made play any worse. 
Of one thing I'm perfectly sure, 
If my temper should follow my pelf, 
My friends from bad words are secure 
For I 
take it all out on yourself. 
I 
gnaw at your dirty old stem, 
And I 
shut myself in with a 
cloud, 
And until I've recovered my phlegm 
I 
do not emerge from my shroud. 
You help me bear sorrow and pain, 
You smooth the rough journey of life: 
You stand by me in sunshine and rain 
And you keep me from anger and strife. 
The longest song must have an end, 
Mine has with this simple recipe; 
If you want to keep terms with a 
friend 
Don't endeavor to put out his pipe.

I love 
so 
well. 
Now don't you think it's very nice, in such a 
scene as this, 
To fix your arm around her waist— steal a 
gentle kiss, 
And whisper tales of love to her, and press her to your heart, 
And vow by all the purple heads your love will ne'er depart? 
Cho. — It's all among the clover, &c. 
Then pluck the gentle clover, that blushes at her feet, 
Then robe your love in garlands, there's nothing half so 
sweet, 
The rose will mantle on her cheek, her eyes will sparkle 
bright, 
All among the clover, on a 
summer's night. 
Cho. — It's all among the clover, Szc. 
There's nothing in this wide, wide world, could please you 
half so well, 
As strolling in the clover, with tales of love to tell; 
It makes your heart rebound with joy, and fills your soul 
with bliss, 
To stroll among the clover, and steal a 
loving kiss. 
Cho.—It's all among the clover, &a.

Broadway, New York. 
Price 30 cents. 
I've wandered very far away 
From the clime where I 
was born 
And my poor heart has been so sad, 
Dejected and forlorn; 
No master kind to treat me well, 
To cheer me when in pain, 
I 
want to see the cotton fields, 
And the dear old home again. 
CHORUS. 
Oh the good old days are passed and gone, 
I 
sigh for them in vain; 
I 
want to see the cotton fields, 
And the dear old home again. 
I'm left all sad and lonely now, 
When my days are very few, 
My wife and children both are gone, 
I 
don't know what to do; 
My master too, he may be dead, 
His hair was turning gray, 
Ott, let me see that good old home, 
Before I 
pass away. 
Oh, the good old days, etc. 
When I 
was free I 
left that land, 
Where the days are bright and fair, 
Where missus spoke to me so kind, 
When I 
was bowed with care; 
I 
left that home no friends to find, 
My heart was filled with pain, 
Oh, take me to that good old home, 
To see it once again. 
Oh, the good old days,

THE WATERMILL. 
As recited by Gus W ILLIAMS, at the Olympic Theatre. 
Listen to the watermill, through the livelong day, 
How the clicking- of its wheel wears the hours away, 
Languidly the autumn wind stirs the greenwood leaves, 
From . the fields the reapers sing, binding up the sheaves; 
And a 
proverb haunts my mind, as a 
spell is cast— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past 
Autumn winds revive no more leaves that once are shed, 
And „he sickle cannot reap corn once gathered; 
And the rippling stream flows on, tranquil, deep and still, 
Never gliding back again to the watermill. 
Truly speaks the proverb old, witk a 
meaning vast— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past 
Take the lesson to thyself, loving heart and true, 
Golden years ar6 fleeting by, youth is passing, too; 
Learn to make the most of life, lose no happy day, 
Time will never bring thee back chances swept away. 
Leave no tender word unsaid, love, while love shall last— 
Tic mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Work while yet the daylight shines, man of strength and will, 
Never does the streamlet glide useless by the mill; 
Wait not till to- morrow's sun beams upon the way, 
All that thou canst call thine own lies in thy— to- day, 
Power, intellect and health may not always last— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Oh ! the wasted hours of life that have drifted by, 
Oh! the good we might have done, lost without a 
sigh! 
Love that we might once have saved by a 
single word, 
Thoughts conceived, but never penned, perishing unheard, 
Take the proverb to thine heart, take and hold it fast— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Oh! love thy God and fellow-man, thyself consider last, 
For come it will, when thou must scan dark errors of the past; 
And when the fight of life is o'er, and earth recedes from view, 
And Heaven in all its glory shines, 'midst the pure, the good 
the true. 
Then you'll see more clearly the proverb deep and vast— 
The null 
never grind with the water that is past.

ME WEARING OF THE GREEN. 
As sung by ALICE BENNETT. 
Oh! Paddy, dear, and did you hear the news that 
goin' 
round, 
The shamrock is forbid by law to grow on Irish ground; 
Saint Patrick's day no more we'll keep, his color can't be 
seen, 
for there's a 
bloody law agin, the wearin' o' the green ? 
I 
met with Napper Tandy and he tuk me by the hand, 
And he said " how's poor ould Ireland, and how does she 
stand?" 
She's the most distressful country that.ever you have seen; 
They're hanging men and women there for • • Wearin' o' 
the Green !" 
[Repeat as Chorus.] 
Then since the color we must wear. is England's cruel red, 
Sure Ireland's sons will ne'er forget the blood that they 
have shed; 
You may take the Shamrock from your.hut, and cast it on 
the sod, 
But ' twill take root and flourish still, tho' under foot ' tis trod 
When the law can stop the blades of grass from growing 
as they grow, 
And when the leaves in summer time their verdure dare 
not show ; 
Then I 
will change the color I 
wear in my corbeen; 
But 'till that day, please God, I'll stick to " Wearin' o' the 
Green." 
[Repeat as Chorus.] 
But if at last our color should be torn from Ireland's heart, 
Her sons with shame and sorrow from the dear old soil will 
part; 
I've heard whisper of a 
country that lies far beyant the say, 
Where rich and poor stand equal in the light of freedom's 
day; 
Oh, Erin must we lave you, driven by the tyrant's hand, 
Must we ask a 
mother's welcome from a 
strange but hap-
pier land ? 
Where the cruel cross of England's thraldom never shall 
be seen, 
And where, thank- God, we'll live and die, still 
Wearin' 
o' the Green." 
[Repeat as Chorus.]

TIME ALONE 
This song was given to JOHNNT RoAcir by Christ. Highland. 
IN doing what we all think best in life's all busy throng 
It's time alone will prove if we are right or if we' re wrong; 
Our judgment's apt to go astray, as through the world we 
move, 
But would you be surprised to hear that time alone will prove'

Time alone will prove as on through life we move, 
You can never read the future, no, it's time alone will prove.

Marriage is a 
lottery, you'll own beyond a 
doubt 
That woman is a 
sort of thing no fellow can make out, 
For he who chose a 
wife in haste, too often has been sold, 
BO when you get a 
good one, you've found a 
mine of gold, 
Time alone, & c. 
Too oft we pat our faith In those who make the greatest show, 
And take their glitter all for dross before their worth we know, 
The gilt wears off, we find them out and somehow they suggest, 
The olden shows at country fairs—the outside is the best. 
Time alone, &c.

Originally sung by VIRGINIA STICKNET. 
Have you seen my Molly Malloy, 
She looks so nice and gay, 
She's left me here to pine and die, 
For she has gone away, 
She ran away the other night, 
Which did my brain annoy, 
Last Friday night she did elope, 
With a 
Tipperary boy. 
CHORUS. 
Have you seen my Molly Malloy,-, 
She's gone with a 
Tipperary boy, 
Tipperary, Tipperary, Tipperary boy. 
It was outside her mother's door, 
She heard this fellow play, 
She sobbed and sigled and said oh my, 
He's stole my heart away, 
'Twas the music that enchanted her, 
Till her heart jumped like a 
toy, 
So last Friday night she skedaddled 
With the Tipperary boy 
Have you seen, &c. 
I've searched the village through and through, 
But her I 
cannot find, 
I've wept till I 
can weep no more, 
My eyes are nearly blind; 
But if ever I 
come across them, 
I 
mean him and Molly Malloy, 
I'll_ put a 
head on her and choke

l'OU NEVER MISS ME 
WATE.m- DIME 
WELL RUNS DRY. 
WHEN a 
child I 
lived at Lincoln with my 
parents at the farm, 
The lessons that my mother taught to me were quite a 
charm; 
Slie would often take me on her knee when tired of childish: 
play, 
And as she pressed me to her breast I've heard my mothe! 
say— 
Waste not, want not, is a 
maxim I 
would teach; 
Let your watchword be " dispatch," and practice what you 
preach; 
Do not let your chances, like sunbeams, pass you by, 
For you never miss the water till the well runs dry. 
As years roll'd on I 
grew to be a 
mischief-making boy, 
Destruction seem'd my only sport, it was my only joy; 
And well do I 
remember, when ofttimes well chastised, 
how father sat beside me then and thus has me advised. 
Waste not, 8
,
:n. 
When I 
arrived at manhood, I 
embark"d in public life, 
And found it was a 
rugged road bestrewn witlr care and strife, 
I 
speculated foolishly. my losses were severe, 
But still a 
tiny, little voice kept whisp'ring in mine ear. 
Waste not, & C. 
Then I 
studied strict economy, and found, to My surprise,. 
My funds, instead of sinking, very quickly then did rise, 
grasp'd each chance and always struck the iron while ' twai 
hot, 
seiz'd my opportunities and never once-forgot— • 
Waste not_ ct-
Im' married now and happy , I've a 
careful little wife, 
.!•1 
We live in mace and harmony, devoid of care and strife; 
Fortune smiles upon us, we have little children three, 
The lessons that I 
teach them, as they prattle round my knney 
Ts, waste not.

We never make a

'Tis one of life's best joys, 
You can see our feet move up and down, 
But you'll never here a

To balls and parties we do go, 
And with the ladies flirt, 
Oh, ain't they nice young fellows, 
The girls they all assert; 
The other gents get jealous 
And say we'er fast young boys, 
They envy us because we sing 
And dance without a

Just watch the way, &c.

We're sorry we must leave,

You'll always find 11.3 boys, 
Ready to sing and dance for you,

When I 
was a 
young horse, and in my youthful prime, 
My master used to ride on me, and thought me very fine. 
Poor old horse! 
Poor old horse! 
But now I'm growing old, and nature does decay. 
My master frowns upon me, and these words to me does say, 
Poor old horse!

When I 
was a 
young horse, I've travelled for many a 
mile 
Over hedges, over ditches, over bridges, gates, in style. 
Poor old horse! 
Poor old horse! 
But now I'm growing old, and nature does decay. 
My master frowns upon me, and these words to me does say, 
Poor old horse! 
Poor old horse! 
To anyone I 
will give my old horse, and his shoes, 
And as for his old carcass for glue they won't refuse. 
Poor old horse 
Poor old horse! 
For now I'm growing old, and scarcely fit to crawl. 
I'm forced to eat the coarsest grass, that grows against the wall.

And don't you tire of dance. 
As recited by DAN CoLLYER. 
Lemme sit down a 
minute, a 
stone's got in my shoe; 
Don't you commence your cussin', I 
ain't done nothin' to you. 
Yes, I'm a 
tramp. 
What of it ? 
Folks say we ain't no good 
But tramps has to live, I 
reckon, though folks don't think we 
should. 
Once I 
was strong and handsome, had plenty of cash and 
clothes, 
That was afore I 
tippled and gin got into my nose. 
Down in the Lehigh Valley me and my people grew, 
I 
was a 
blacksmith, Cap'en—yes, and a 
good one, too; 
Me and my wife and Nellie. 
Nellie was just sixteen, 
She was the pootiest creeter the Valley had ever seen. 
Beaux ? 
Why, she had a 
dozen—had 'em from near and fur, 
But they were mostly farmers—none of 'ern suited her. 
There was a 
city stranger—young, handsome, and tall, 
Damn him—I 
wish I 
had him strangled agin that wall. 
He was the man for Nellie--she didn't know no ill; 
Mother, she tried to stop it, but you know a 
young gal's will. 
Well, it's the same old story—common enough, you'll say, 
He was a 
soft- tongued devil, and got her to run away.. 
More than a 
month or after we heard from the poor young 
thing, 
He'd gone away and left her without a 
wedding ring. 
Back to her home we brought her, back to her mother's side, 
Filled with a 
raging fever—she fell at my feet and died. 
Frantic -with shame and trouble, her mother began to sink, 
Dead—in less than a 
fortnight—that's when I 
took to drink. 
Gimme one glass, Curnel, and then I'll be on my way, 
I'll tramp till I 
find that scoundrel, if it takes till the Judg-
ment Day.

American Fortune-Telling Cards.-This is rne old-
est and most widely known pack of Fortune-Telling Cards. We have 
published it for years, and the demand is continually increasing. 
ftese Cards are arr ngal and printed in series-Hearts, Clubs, Dia-
liaonds and Spades-and each or these into K for King, Q for Queen. 
Said K 
for Knave, and numbers 1, 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
lour rows, and are to be read according to directions. Many of the an. 
ewers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. The 
nxethod of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under-
standing. 
Many professional Fortune-Tellers use these cards, and we 
are in receipt of letters in relation to them from all parts of the U. S. 
/Inclosed in handsome case 
Price 25 Cents. 
Courting Cards.-This Series of Cards has been arranged 
bo meet a 
want frequently felt by young people-a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too die. 
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an nnlady-like encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many 
lives are spent as an unloved 
'tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and belt] g 
in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own. unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two ialayers, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties

Little Book has lately appeared in print at Mr. A. J. Finals's, 98 Nee-
Stu street called the •` Little Flirt." We cannot say that we recommend 
it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, as we think it would only 
encourage the bad habit of " flirting." 
Unfortunately, there is enough. 
ef it done without any further necessity of explaining " how, whore aid 
eehere to do it," and this little volume would advise and initiate the U.S. 
corrupted in practicing what is commonly called "flirting."
