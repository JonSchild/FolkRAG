One of [Mr Milwaukee nephews?] was recently burned to death in a hotel fire in Baltimore [?] [I
Think?] it would be kinder [if?] omit his one[.?] [Tain't?] a very good song anyhow [md] just [a?] good
sample [md] [?][?][2:40+?][substitute?][?]
THE MILWAUKEE FIRE'Twas the gray of early morning when the dreadful cry of "Fire!"Rang out upon
the cold and piercing air.Just that little word alone was all it did requireTo [send?] dismay and panic
everywhere.Milwaukee was excited as she never'd been beforeOn learning that the fire bells all
aroundWere ringing through eternity a hundred [souls?] orAnd the Newhall House was burning to
the ground.When the dreadful alarm was sounded through that oft-condemned hotel,They rushed
in mad confusion [?] every way.The smoke was suffocating, and blinded them as well:The Fire King
could not be held at bay.[(Sung in 1937 but omitted in 1954)?](Oh, hear the fire bells ringing on the
morning's early dawn!Oh, hear them as they give the dreadful [cry?]!Oh, hear the wail of terror, mid
fierce and burning flames!Heaven protect and bless those waiting there to die!)From every window
men and women wildly would beseechFor help in tones of anguish and despair;What could have
been their feelings when the ladders [would?] not reach, [??????????] And (they [found?]) death (['s?]
grasp) clasped around them [everywhere?]!In one window you could see a man , his wife stood by
his [side?] [md] They tell us that this was a millionaire.To save him from this dreadful fire. they left no
means untried,(But) Gold nor treasure had no value there.A boy stood in the window and his mother
down below,And when she saw the flames approaching wild,With up-raised hands to pray for him,
she knelt down in the snow,And the stoutest hearts heart could not restrain a tear.She madly rushed
towards the fire and wildly tore her hair,Saying, "God, take me, but spare my pride and joy!"She
saw the flames surround him, and then in dark despair,Said: "Oh God, have mercy on my only
boy!"Up in the highest window [s tood?] a servant girl alone,And the crowd beneath all [s tood?] with
[bated?] breath,They [t urned?] away their faces with many's the [s tifled?] groan,When she jumped
to meet perhaps as hard a death.They tell us now that this hotel had been on fire before,[Andnot?]
considered safe for several years.But the man that owned it let it run on as before;And they are not
to blame, it now appears.Incendiarism this time has been the cause, they say,But who the fiend is,
they cannot tell.But Milwaukee will not rest, neither by night or day,Until this matter is investigated
well. 2 Milwaukee FireBut that will be no benefit to those who passed awayIn Milwaukee's greatest
funeral pyre.And peace be[-?]to their [a shes?]! [?] the best that we can sayFor the victims of this
great [a nd?] [d readful?] fire.

The [?] Newhall House in [Milwuakee?] burned to the groundJanuary 10, 1883, 5 months before
the singer was born. [ [?]?] Itstill seemed perfectly reasonable to him and his friends thatthe
hotel's owner should be held morally innocent of thehigh percentage of death's, his responsibility
apparentlylimited only to first causes,[?] not [e xtending?] to [su ch?] indirectprotection as fire [e
scapes?].
This song is typical of those made up about variousdisasters, fires and explosions being an especially
popular subject,along with sea disasters like the sinking of the Titanicand various tragedies on
[e xcursion?] steamers. Unlike the balladsbuilt upon tragedies that occur in the almost noraml
course ofwork, [md] in mines, on river drives, accidents [to s ailorsat?] sea [md] where the particular
incident is [?] made to stand for hazardscommon to a large group of people, taking on therefore
a classicand symbolic air. The present ballad belongs to a group ofparticular accidents that
involve people who did not know theywere running any risk, and the general tone is personal and
individualand inclined to [bathos?].
The tune is [?] a late 19th [c entury?] popular type ofmelody.Sung by Robert Walker,1942 1952.
