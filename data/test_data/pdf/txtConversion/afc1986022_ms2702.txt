0445.1 What do you like to talk about? IN: Hot-rodding, mostly. FW: Hot-rodding, huh? No
kidding! Do you have model cars of your own? IN: Yea. FW: <unintelligible text> IN: No.
One thirty-second scale. The big ones. FW: Do you have some sort of a track from these?
IN: Yes, I have a track for them, but mostly we take them to the places where you race
them on the FW: Slot racing. IN: yes. Places. FW: What are those driven by? IN: Uh, by
0445.2 electricity, say. Well, there's your hand-control which shuts off the electricity and
puts on the electricity, and, uh, mostly you have it on all of the time instead of having it off.
FW: Oh, yea? Has this got variable speeds? You can make it go faster or slower? IN: Yes.
You hand control. it's numbered from ten to 120, and in between there they have all the
other speeds of the car and everything. Fw: Do the front-wheels turn by
0445.3 electricity too? IN: No, there's a guiding pin underneath it. It turns the whole car
at the same time. FW: Oh, I see. And, do you have a track in your own basement or
something? IN: Upstairs in my bedroom. Not much, but it makes a figure eight, that's all.
FW: How many cars do you have, just one? IN: Uh, no. I have six. Yea, six! FW: Six! IN:
But, see, there's only three bodies, you know, the motors and everything, and there
0445.4 are six shells to put them on. FW: (yes) Oh, I see. You've got three bodies and six
shells. And what body types do you have? IN: I have Ford G.T., the Cobra G.T., and, uh,
I got two Baracuda's, I have the, uh, Dodge C-500, and I have the, uh, well, it's a crazy

afc1986022.afc1986022_ms2702
model. They have these models out, and, uh, sometimes you get interested and you work
on it and put it on your car and it's called Super Fuzz that I got. FW: (yes) IN: (yes)
0445.5 So that's all six. FW: (yes) The super, what was it? IN: Super Fuzz. It's a crazy
man in a car like that. Once in a while you buy them and put them on your cars like that.
FW: Oh, yea. I see. Sort of a stunt man, huh? IN: Yea. FW: (yes) Sounds like real great
fun. Do you get your friends together and race with them? Is that the idea? IN: No, usually
all of my friends have H.O. cars, and I only have, let's see, three friends
0445.6 that have 1/32 scale. That's all. FW: Do they live right near here or somewhere
else? IN: Well, uh, one lives on Yemans over there and one lives way in Detroit over there.
And he comes around here once in awhile. FW: Is 1/32 scale better than the H.O., is it?
IN: Well, the H.O., it's only that big, and the 1/32 scale is that big and they have the 1/25
scale and the 1/24 scale and the 1/24 scale is the biggest. It's
0445.7 about that big, the cars come, but, uh, if I wanted to race a 1/25 and 1/24 on my
track it would be too big. It would take up the whole track, so I couldn't race it. And, uh,
that's all. Just four kinds of car. And the H.O. can't race on these tracks that they have, like
on Campeu (Joe Campeu street name) like that, they have these racing places where the
H.O. can't race on them because they don't have the same kind of guiding pin like
0445.8 that. They have two pieces of metal underneath the car, uh, that, uh, and they have
two different kinds of contacts on the track, different then ours. Ours is bursh contacts. We
have these, uh, brush wires like that stick up from guiding pin going into the guiding pin
they contact with it, and we have uh, they have only a little pin like that we go, uh, we got a
straight piece of plasitc underneath ours that guides them along

0445.9 the track. FW: Tell me, if I were to buy model cars like this for my little boy, do you
think I'd be best to buy the H.O., 1/25, 1/24, or 1/32? Which do you think's the best? IN:
Well, I don't really know because I got interested in the 1/32 so I bought the 1/32, and my
boyfriends, well, liked the H.O. so they bought the H.O., so I couldn't really know. FW: Are
there any advantages to having the bigger car? IN: Well,
0445.10 the advantages are that you could race them on different...you can go on different
places, and on these big slot cars, but, the H.O., you can only have your own, they can't
go on couple like that and race them in those big places because they don't have places
like that. There's supposed to be one store on Campeu, it's called D.J.'s Store, hobby
store, he sell all kinds of things. They're supposed to open up an H.O. track
O445.11 because there never been an H.O. track opened up for racing H.O.'s on these big
old lanes like that. And, uh, the 1/32 scale, well, you can go to these places because they
have the same kind of guiding pin like that. FW: (yes) IN: And, uh, couldn't say which one
is better if you liked it or not. FW: Can you race the 1/24 and 1/25 on these places, too?
IN: Yes, they're very big. They have eight lanes and some have twelve.
0445.12 lanes, one at a time, and they have racing there for championship and you can
get trophies like that if you win and everything. FW: Yea? IN: (yes) FW: Do you have to
pay so much for track fielding anywhere? Is that it? IN: Yea. It's usually 75 cents an hour,
and, uh, 50 cents a half an hour, and usually you get a big old gang of kids and they all
pitch in, you know, and you just go there and you race your cars. Usually you have..you
0045.13 pitch in, and then, uh, say like there's six kids and you got a half an hour, well,
each kid gets, uh, his car for hour like that and you go for six hours. FW: Yea. That's really
great. That's not too expensive though is it? IN: Uh, I put thirty bucks into my racing set.

afc1986022.afc1986022_ms2702
FW: Oh, yea? IN: And most of the kids, my boyfriend has a $150 bucks into his racing set,
and, my other boyfriend, he has $75 into his racing set. FW:
0045.14 Boy, that's expensive. IN: He has 25 cars, I think. Bodies and shells and
everything. FW: Are the H.O.'s a lot cheeper than the other ones? IN: Oh, yes. The 1/32
scale, uh, the kit, to put it together yourself cost $4, and, uh, when it's all completef like
that in the box, it usually costs about $7, and the H.O., it's all completed at once and only
costs about $2.95. That's all. FW: So there is a difference in price,
0045.15 then? IN: Yes. Fw: Well, that sounds really interesting. Have you won any
trophies with your sets? IN: No. I don't go for racing with the,. My boyfriend did. He won
one. He came in second place, I think. FW: Is there any way you can make your cars go
faster or things like that? IN: Well, you buy these books and, uh, they tell you, usually you
buy these books and they tell you to rewind your motors inside, and to make
0045.16 them go faster. I did that once, and it picked up about two miles per hour more
then it did usually. That's all it picked up. FW: It's a lot of work rewinding the motor, isn't
it? IN: Well, it takes time, but you have to have the patience and everything. You don't
work on it all in one day. Usually you do, well, there's three..you have to wind three
watchamacallit, little things in the motor, and you usually do one a day, you
0045.17 solder itup to the fly wheel. That's all. FW: Really rough, huh? Do you think that
maybe, uh, after you finish school and at <Ostera?>, you'll go into something like that? IN:
Uh, not really. I wanted to be a commercial pilot. Go into flying school. First I finish, uh,
high school, then I go into, actually, after four years in college and then I have to go to the,
uh, flying school, and then from flying school to electronics, and

afc1986022.afc1986022_ms2702
0045.18 from electronics to, uh, a master degree in flying. And then from that, well, get my
own plane to start flying. FW: I suppose in every it's like that, but you'll still be a mechanic.
Tell me, what kind of games do other kids play around here? IN: Uh, we have baseball
diamonds and in the winter we have hockey in the ice skating rinks in the alley, and, uh,
playing badmiton and, well, tennis ain't too hot, but we usually
0045.19 play it once in awhile, and, then volleyball and basketball. FW: Do you play any
of these sports? IN: Uh, Yes, I play most of them. Basketball, volleyball, hockey, and
baseball. FW: Do you have your skates and stick for hockey? IN: Yes. Also a puck. FW:
Well, that's interesting. Do you ever watch professional teams play in Detroit? IN: Yes.
N.H.L, uh and the Globetrotters in basketabll, Pistons and
0045.20 everything, usually go to some of their games with, uh, watch, you call it.
Altarboys, and everything like that. FW: Detroit Red Wings didn't do too badly last year,
did they? IN: No, they didn't. They won, watch you may call, mostly all of them that they
played, except the Montreals. Well, the Montreals, they were cheating mostly, they said in
the papers that they were, uh, they were cheating on stealing the
0445.21 puck away from them. I don't know what it was. I read it. I forgot about it now. FW:
Hockey's a pretty rough sport,though, isn't it? IN: Oh, yes. You hear about them getting
their teeth bashed in, and getting broken legs, like that, and everything. But they say if you
play the game right, like in football, uh, they have a manager, in school, and, um, he tells
you if you play the game right you won't get hurt like that and every-
0045.22 thing. I guess it's the same thing with hockey and baseball, and everything else.
FW: You won't get hurt so bad if you play right? IN: Yes. FW: Do you have a league that
you play in at school? IN: Um, a football. We have a football team, but no hockey team

afc1986022.afc1986022_ms2702
or baseball team like that. Just a football team. FW: In the summer is there a little league
team in baseball? IN: Uh, not from our school. We go to Hamtramck Park and
0045.23 we sign up for our baseball leagues like that and we get picked for teams,
and..FW: Do you play in the summer? IN: Uh, I was called back this year because I played
four years in our little leagues. I was supposed to go to pony league, but I couldn't go this
year. I don't know why, but I just didn't go back. FW: You didn't go back, huh? IN: NO. FW:
(yes) That sure sounds interesting. Tell me, do you watch T.V. much? IN: Uh, not
0045.24 lately. Mostly spend my time around the house. Uh, my sisters get flats on their
bikes so I fix them, and I usually go out with my boyfriend fishing, and, only in the night
time between, uh...we watch about three movies in the night time. That's all. I don't watch
any in the day time. FW: Where do you go fishing with your boyfriend? IN: Uh, at Lake St.
Clair. FW: Oh, yea? IN: Yes. FW: Good fishing there? IN: Oh, I catch yellow
0045.25 bellied perch and sometimes carps, but that's once in a great, great long while.
And then, there comes the sheephead, you catch very often, and the suckers, uh, catfish.
That's all catfish (garble). FW: How long has it been since you've been fishing? IN: Uh,
three years now. I got my rods and reels and everything, my tackle box and everything
when I was ten, and, uh, my father bought a cottage and we've been going out there very
0045.26 often and we ice fish in the winter time, and we skate in the wintertime, and fish
in the...well, he has a sixteen foot boat we fish in the summertime, when we go out there.
FW: Sounds great. IN: Well, if you like fishing, it's okay. FW: Been this year yet? IN: Yes.
I've been there about, well, not that he's...he lives so far out there not that we have to stay
for about a couple days and we stayed there for about

0045.27 two weeks, fishing, and we went around there and had lots of fun there, go
swimming. We had a beach down by the dock over there. FW: What's the biggest fish
you've caught? IN: Uh, a catfish. He was five pounds, I think. FW: Do you eat catfish? IN:
No. They don't--we just eat perch and sheephead. That's all my family likes. FW: What do
you do with the catfish? Do you give them to the dog, do you? IN: No,
0045.28 uh, there's a woman down the block. She likes them. She takes them off our
hand. FW: Must be a lot of fun, though, huh? IN: Oh, yes. It's okay. I like it. FW: Yes.
Do you take Bonnie with you out to the lake? IN: No. Well, she doesn't like the water
mostly. We give her a bath, we have to drag her into the bathtub, cause she doesn't like
the...everytime we go some place she's always out to the car first. FW: Oh, yea? IN:
0045.29 And she knows our car by heart, the yellow and white Ford. FW: She knows when
it's coming down the lane, does she? IN: (yes) She knows when it's coming. Everytime my
father comes home with it. We can tell when my father's home, when she goes by the door
and starts wagging her tail. We know he's home right there. FW: It's nice to have a dog like
that, isn't it. IN: Oh, yea. FW: Does she belong to anybody in the family
0045.30 or is she just the family's dog? IN: Well, she's the whole family's dog. We play
with her. FW: Uh, tell me about your school. IN: Oh, it's okay. I don't like it much because
we don't have very many sports, uh--there...and there's mostly, uh, well, the only sport that
they have is basketball, and that's after school, and you read about all these other kids.
They have swimming and everything, and it just makes
0445.31 you sick because they have swimming and everything, and you just have gym
and, uhm, it's after school at the same time, and, well, it's okay. We learn very much in
there, and uh, well, we have switching of the classes. I'm glad for that because it's boring

just to sit in one class after all that time, you know. And just listen to the same teacher over
and over, and now in the seventh grade, we have the--we go from eight grade Sister
0045.32 to the seventh grade Sister and then back to our class again. We switch classes
three time. I like it. Well, it doesn't get you bored all the time, and in these classes we have
three major subjects. Switching of the classes, and your major subjects. And, uh, we don't
have very much, whatchamacallit, lunch period, see, we go--we start from quarter to to
twelve, and by the time we get done with our lunch it's about ten after twelve,
0045.33 and we sometimes don't even stay out until twelve thirty, uh, playing.
It's...we..she, the superior usually rings the bell at twenty after twelve. That's only ten
minutes of playing and we're usually supposed to get from, uh, twelve to twelve thirty and
we go to lunch, to the cafeteria at, uh, quarter to twelve, so we usually play football out
there with, uh, one of the teachers call Mr. Philly, he teaches fifth grade, and we stay
0045.34 out there until twelve thirty, and when we come in, we get bawled at, we get
yelled at,... we get bawled out by the nun because, uh, she told the bells rang at twenty
after twelve and, uh, every body was in there and we said our prayers at the time, and,
well, it's just not enough playing time, I guess. FW: You like sports alot, huh? IN: Yes. I like
them. FW: How about when you get to high school? They'll have sports
0045.35 there, won't they? IN: Well, I'm not going to St. Florine High School because for
the simple reason, the only sport there is, uh, baseball, and now there's not going to be
any baseball, I heard. I'm not sure because it's supposed to trade baseball from track, and,
uh, if we can--we cannot get track then baseball and track is gonna be out at the same
time and the only thing we'll have is gym. That will be after school, too, in high

0045.36 school. So... FW: So you're going to Hamtramck High, are you? IN: No, I
picked De La Salle, uh, whatchamacallit, High School. FW: Is that a Catholic High
School? IN: Yes. That's Catholic. FW: Where is that? IN: Uh, it's down by the airport, on
whatchamacallit, I forgot which road it is, but it's down by the airport down over there. It's
right across the street from the airport, uh, it's a very short ride on a bus,
0045.37 but you should take a bike there. Doesn't take that much time to get there or
nothin'. Just take whatchamacallit, Van Dyke down to Lynch Road and Lynch Road
straight dow. FW: So you go by bike everyday, huh? IN: NO. I don't know, now. I'm still not
in the school yet. And I have one more year in St. Florian and the--switch to De La Salle.
FW: I'm interested in the way you pronounce some of the names of the furni-
0045.38 ture in the classroom, so will you pronounce some of the names of furniture in
the classrooms? IN: Well, our desk, um, our teacher's desk, and then the book mark, and
then the shelves, uh...FW: Does the teacher have something to write on in the front of the
classroom? IN: On the blackboard, and then, uh, let's see. FW: Does the teacher have
something to sit on? IN: Chair. FW: When you step outside your classroom, you're
0045.39 in what room of the building? What the name of the room outside of the

catcher, the face mask, knee pads, chest matt, and, uh, the spikes for everybody playing
baseball. And then for tennis you have your shorts, you have your short-sleeved, uh,
0445.41 pull-over shirt, and you have your tennis shoes, and you have your ball. FW: How
about, uh, I was thihking of this equipment that stays in the park. Uh, the things you go
back and forth on. IN: Well, that stuff, the bats and ball in baseball, the knee pads... FW: I
was thinking of things like swings. IN: Oh, swings? Well, the swings, the see-saw, uh, the
monkey bars, and then, uh, that's all. FW: What are monkey bars
0445.42 like? IN: Well, you climb all over them. It's,uh, shaped like a, uh, a U, upside
down U, and they have a kind of bars across it, and everything. You climb on them and
everything. You swing on them. FW: What do the kids do after school's out? IN: Well,
the first thing you usually do when school is out, you come home, well, you first do your
homework so you've got more time to play after you get done eating, but it turns night. But
0445,43 for most of the kids, like my boyfriends, and I stay out at night and play flash-light
tag in the wintertime. FW: Oh, you're kidding. IN: Pardon? FW: That sounds interesting.
IN: It's just a game. It's played with a flashlight and if you spot the person you have to
catch them with the beam of the flashlight before he touches glue. And it's played mostly at
night. FW: He touches the glue? IN: Glue. Yea. Usually it's
0445,44 something like a telephone pole or something. You call it a glue. I don't know why,
but it's usually called glue. You have to touch that before he touches you with the beam of
the light. FW: Tell me, did you ever have a teacher who hollered at you a lot? IN: Oh, yea.
Well, not a teacher. Mostly a Sister. Uh, I have three of them, I think it was. Yes, it was last
year in the seventh grade, and then it was in, uh, fourth grade,

afc1986022.afc1986022_ms2702
0445.45 and then in sixth grade. FW: Why did they holler at you? IN: Well, it was mostly
for, in seventh grade, um, she hollered at everybody, mostly all the boys, because, uh, we
have to put our name on the board for a penalty, and usually you don't go up there to put
it on because you know it's not your fault. The other kid hit me in the back and you fell like
turning around and hitting him so you wait when the nun isn't looking at you
0445.46 and you turn around and hit him and then he holds you there and the nun turns
around and he lets go of you and you're ready to turn around into the front and she spots
you, you know, and you have to go put your name on the board, so I didn't go one time,
so she started hollering at me, and so, well, to get out of it, well, we go to church in the
morning and you wait for the...mass to be over and you get first one in line and you
0445.47 run with the boy with the keys to open the door, and you go inside real fast and
you erase your name at the same time, and she forgets about it, so you're cleared over
there. And in the sixth grade, we, everybody used to go out on Campau during the lunch
hour. We used to buy a bag of candy..50 bag of candy, and, uh, we used to eat it in class
and if she'd catch you she'd tell you to put your name on the board, and
0445.48 she'd tell you how much it would cost, you know, and, oh, I usually have to pay
a dollar fifty, and if I didn't pay the dollar fifty I wouldn't get my report card, so I didn't pay
the dollar fifty and I got my report card. It was in the beginning of, uh, seventh grade,
uh, in September first I got my report card back, my sixth grade report card. That's when
everybody else got their report card, too. FW: It didn't
0445.09 make any difference actually? IN: Well, no. It didn't. Well, it's lots of fun, I mean,
but you're not supposed to do it very often. Only did it once or twice like that. Just joking
around, because if you, uh, if you pretend, like, you know, if you're always a good guy in

class the boys would, you know, they'd look at you, you know, and they'd call you some
kind of sissy, and everything. And, well, the marks don't care,
0445.50 say, like you get all A's. Well, you don't mind getting all A's even if they do call
you, uh, whatchamacallit, uh, smartie or anything. You don't care if you get A's. But when
you sit-good in class like that, well, looks different on you, like they start calling you baby
and everything like that. That's only in class, but in report cards I usually get good marks.
Like one time I got A's and B's without no C's,
0445.51 and I topped my boyfriend off three <unintelligible text> time in the first three
semesters, and he was calling me baby and everything like that. I didn't care about it
because I got better marks than he did. But when yon, whatchamacallit, don't fool around
in class, you don't look too hot. FW: You have to be a little bit bad, huh. IN: Yes. So they
can look good. FW: Did you ever have a teacher who was really the best teacher in your
whole
0445.52 life? IN: Well, the best one was, uh, in fourth grade. We had two teachers. Uh.
she was <unintelligible text>. She was a nice teacher, never yelled at anybody, and, uh,
she never hit anybody. Well, we always obeyed her. She and I got along good. She used
to go with the kids and, uh, you know, when they'd ask for no homework, she'd sometimes
give them no homework, but once in a while when we'd fool around when she was talking,
she'd
0445.53 give us a little bit of homework, and she'd let us do our homework in class like
that, and, uh, sometimes she'd have a spelling bee in class, and we'd play baseball in
spelling and all sorts of things like that. We'd have parties like that, birthday parties. So,
she wasn't so bad. That's the only good teacher I ever had, I guess.
