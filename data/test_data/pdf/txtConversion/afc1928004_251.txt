NICODEMUS JOHNSON, 
As sung by COOL BCRGESS. 
Music published by °LIM DITSON & CO 
I'VE just arrived in town to-day, 
And here I 
is before you, 
To sing about my name mut occupation; 
I 
come from Old Virginia State, 
De best in all de nation; 
Oh, ho! oh 
ho! to Nicodemus Johnson. 
My master was a 
Union man, 
He did not like Secession; 
And so, he had to leave the old plantation: 
I 
thought to stay behind him there, 
'Twould be an aggravation: 
Oh, ho! oh! ho! to Nicodemus Johnson. 
1'se glad dis war come to an end, 
And peace come fro'd de nation; 
I'll go right back to Dixie's land, and stay dar 
For, I 
isn't any contraband, 
I 
love de old plantation; 
Oh, ho ! oh! ho ! that's Nicodemus Johnson.

THE HOOLAHAN MUSKETEERS. 
Copyrighted 1875, by, and Music to be had of, E. H. ITALDING, R20 
Bowery, opposite Prince St. 
Words and Music by T. 
E. 
POWT:DB. 
As sung by MAXWELL 36 REYNOLDS. 
It was on a 
Saturday night 
That we started a 
Company, 
And elected Anthony Wright, 
Our Captain to be; 
Ho accepted office with thanks, 
And appointed us Pioneers 
For to march in front of the ranks, 
In the Hoolahan Musketeers! 
CHORUS. 
We march like soldiers thro' the streets, 
With our new flags flying so gay; 
And bate the time wid both our feet, 
'While the band did sweetly play ; 
From windows high the girls did look, 
And they smiled at the Pioneers, 
And then their handkerchiefs they shook, ' 
At the Hoolahan Musketeers. 
To the guests invited we gave 
All the prizes to carry round, 
And at nine o'clock we did lave, 
For to go to the shooting ground, 
Where we stopp'd for two hours or more; 
And we toasted the Pioneers, 
Had eating and drinking galore, 
Did the Hoolahan Musketeers ! 
We march'd, 
But when we got back to the Ward, 
It was then we felt light and gay ; 
And our Captain flourish'd his sword, 
While the crowd did lave the way; 
At Mona.hans we broke up then, 
And faith, we gave three hearty cheers, 
For the officers fr:nd the men. 
In the Hoolahan Musketeers 
We march'd, leb 
The Less I 
Say of It, the Better. 
Written and Sung by Gus W ILTJANTs. 
Its Wonderful how we do it, but we do." 
New songs will come around, 
As new subjects they abound, 
And the one I've, got, I 
think is just the cheese too, 
And if it makes a 
hit, 
Why then, I 
don't care a 
bit, 
For my object is for to sing and to please you. 
It's a 
saying by the way, 
That you hear every day, 
And sometimes you read it in a 
letter ; 
So with no more preface, 
I 
will introduce my case— 
For, I 
think the less I 
say of it, the better. 
A 
young man in the street, 
A 
pretty girl does meet, 
And introduces himself by sweet talking ; 
She thinks he is so nice, 
For he talks as smooth as ice 
To her, as along the street they're walking; 
And not long after that, 
She's got on a 
new hat, 
And way up-town we find that he has met her; 
And when it does get dark, 
They walk into the Park— 
Well, I 
think the less I 
say of it the better. 
I've been idle just a 
year, 
And I'm feeling rather queer, 
As to where I 
m going for to raise some money; 
For it's true upon my life, 
Iv'e got a 
darling wife, 
And she can't live very long on love and honey; 
But there's bne thing so fine, 
We've no children so divine, 
So poverty it don't seem such a 
fetter. 
lint on this you may rely, 
There will come some by-aul-bye— 
Well, I 
think the less I 
say of it 
better.

OH! NICODEMUS. 
My 
lover he's going to sea, Oh! Nicodemus, 
He's going away and leaving me, 
To watch the little fishes, swimming in the sea 
Hut he'll soon wish for home, and to be back with ntte, 
The ship will heave to, Nicodemus! 
And so wretched you will be, so wretched you will be. 
Cnolte. 
(Spoken.) So she said— 
Oh, Nicodemus ! Nicodemus! 
don't you go away? 
I've loved you Nicodemus and I've loved you many a 
day, 
I've loved you in your plain attire, your lovely fustian co. 
Don,t leave me Nicodemus, for that boiler-bursting boat. 
(SPoxEN.) And again she began to sing— 
Salt water, you know, is very wet, Oh, Nicodenins 
You know you are my only pet, 
And your absence will cause me to fume and fret; 
They will feed you on salt junk and nasty soft boiled peas 
Think of this well: Nicodemus ! 
Ere you cross those watery seas, those windy watery sea.s; 
Sc ehe said, Ltc. 
And she also said— 
Of pumpkins boiled you'll get no more, Ob. Niovglenzast 
Convince yourself of this before, 
You can't run away there's no flack door f 
Reef' the anchor, Nicodemus, the Captain he will sal 
You'll have to hold on by your eyebrows, 
Or you'll be blown away, straight down to Botany Bay 4 
So she said, &Q. 
This is what he said— 
It's no use you talking tome; said Nicodemus ? 
For I 
intend agoing out to sea, 
Out to China for Souchong and Lingo Tea. 
That's a 
profitable cargo, in fact you eau't get a 
better,„ 
Direct from Hong Kong, Australia, 
Witeu you send to me a 
letter, you send to me a 
lettee 
A_nd she began again yelping, 
Oh, Niccel,emes,

GOOSE AND INGUNS. 
As sung by Sof, Smrria RossELL. 
Oh, dear! I'm nearly starving, 
I 
want something nice to eat, 
I 
fancy myself carving; 
Big pies and joints of meat. 
Roast pork or leg of mutton, 
To me would be of use; 
And though I'm not a 
glutton, 
Still, I'd polish off a 
goose! 
Cnon-
es. 
For it is my opinion, 
That stuffed with sage and ing,un, 
No bird that flies is halt so nice, 
As a 
goose with sage and ingun. 
Tra -very fond of Turkey, 
Spring Chicken is good to take; 
Of Partridge or of Pheasant, 
A 
dinner I 
could make. 
1like corned beef and mustard, 
Or sirloin steak with juice, 
Or Prairie hen or Bustard fat, 
But most I 
love a 
Goose! 
For it is ray opinion, &c. 
I've liver tried, and bacon, 
And tripe both boiled and fried; 
A 
sheep's-head I 
have taken, 
And put myself outside. 
•Th,qigh turtle soup is filling, 
And fish-balls joy produce; 
'Tis not the rapture or the joy, 
That appertains to goose ! 
For it i7 my opinion, &c.

DISSOLVING VIEWS. 
Composed and sung by GEORGE HARRLS. 
AIM — Castles in the Air. 
While thinking of some past events at home the other night, 
Seatal.at my cheerful fire, which then was burning bright, 
At last the fir& began to fade—a 
shadow o'er it.grew; 
I 
fancied I 
was looking'at some great dissolving view; 
Some views there were that gave me joy, while others gave 
me pain; 
Oh! may I 
never see them in reality again ; 
So give me your attention, and I'll quickly tell to you 
Some pictures that I 
witnessed in my great dissolving view. 
The first view was of sad distress, a 
truly wretched case .; 
The family of a 
workingman. hunger stared them in the face 
The mother and their children gatherd round a 
scanty fire, 
The last sparks even threatening every moment to expire; 
At last the father enters, and hangs his honest head, 
And silently he shares with them his last loaf of bread, 
Though honest, he is forced to steal and into jail he's threw; 
This sad and truthful picture is my second dissolving view. 
The next was a 
police court; two prisoners in were led ; 
One, a 
well-dressed swindler, and the other a 
boy ill-fed ; 
The boy had stolen, and confessed his guilt, and for pardon 
did entreat. 
He said, " lam an orphan boy, and nothing had to eat; 
Three months hard labor was his doom—the tears ran 
down his face • 
While he who swindled many a 
man walked out with a 
good grace; 
Be paid for counsel with his spoil—his money put him 
through— 
That ends the case, and he gets free in this dissolving view. 
The third it was a 
murder cold, a 
tragic one, I'm sure ; 
It was a 
man of manly heart, and a 
good friend to the poor, 
Shot down by an assassin, dastardly and cold! 
• 
But shooting men quite unawares is the fashion now, I'm 
told; 
The murder of Jim Fisk, I 
mean, a 
man known to you all. 
In this wide world lie played his part, and rolling kept the 
ball; 
I 
hope his spirit's gone aloft, I 
most sincerely do, 
Ever more to rest in peace, in this dissolving view.

PULL DOWN THE BLIND, 
say by To'' 
DID you ever make love ? If not, Ihc:1-, ; I 
try, 
I 
courted a 
girl once, so bashful and. 
A. fair little creature who by the 4, 
At coaxing and wheedling had 
nice way; 
.7v'ry night to her house I 
went, 
In harmless del:ght our evenings NI%Te spent, 
She had a 
queer saying, whatever it meant, 
for whenever I 
entered 
she would say : 
CHORUS. 
Pull down the blind, pull down the blind, 
Pull down the blind, love, come don't be unkih 
Though we're alone, bear this in mind, 
Somebody': looking, love, pull down the blind. 
How loving we wera, how cosy we'd chat, 
'Bout oue thing and Cother, and this thing and that, 
With my arm round her waist, how cosy we sat, 
Like two little turtle- doves perched on a 
tree; 
Such squeezing and teasing and pleasing we had— 
Such wooing and cooing to make our hearts 
lad, 
With laughing and chaffing I 
near drove her mad; ' 
But still she was awfully spooney on me. 
SPOKEN.—And if that soldier would only have left us alone, 
she would never have exclaimed: 
Pull dc.rwn the ; 111141, etc. 
ii 
211 
Due night, for a 
change, we went to the play, 
And when we got home she was awfully gay, 
She saw them make love, and so learned the way, 
The piece was " Claude Melnotte," and suited her line; 
She called me her rose- bud, her duck, and her dear, 
She threw her arms round me, while fast fell each tear; 
She cried, oh, don't leave me, for sadly I 
fear 
You don't love me truly, say, will you be mine? 
SPOKEN,— Just at that moment a 
policeman passed, and she 
said: 
Pull down the blind, etc.. 
Our courting days o'er, at last we were wed, 
I 
oft bless the hour when to church her I 
led, 
I 
now call her Mary, she calls me Ned, 
We're happy and loving, and never know strife; 
We've a 
fine handsome lass, and two noble boys, 
Trouble or sorrow, never u.s annoys; 
Of life we've the sweets, and while tasting its joys, 
I'm thankful I'm blessed with a 
good little w.fe. 
SPOKEN.—And should an angry word rise to my lips, with a 
:r.eek smile on her face she'll exclaim: 
22 
23 
PERHAPS SHE'S ON THE RAILWAY, 
BEHOLD in me a 
wretched man, quite broken down by 
woe, 
I've lost my wife and cannot find her anywhere I 
go; 
At fir* she robbed me of my heart and now she's flovna 
from me, 
A.nd taken all my furniture, wherever can she be? 
Crtor.us. 
Perhaps she's on the railway, with a 
swell so fair,— 
Perhaps she't) up in a 
balloon, flying thro' the air; 
Perhaps she's dead, perhaps alive, perhaps she's on the sm 
Perhaps she's gone to Brigham Young, a 
Mormonite to be. 
Bhe read so much of Mormonites, of nothing else she'd talk, 
And with a 
sanctified young char) each day she used tt.) 
walk; 
lihe said he wag a 
Mormon rr 
from far across the sea, 
I 
have not seen her for a 
r 
wherever can she be ? 
Perhaps she's, &c. 
She can't respect the marriage vows, that faithfully she 
swore, 
I 
only hope her Mormon spouse has' fifty wives or more; 
I 
hope he'll thrash her every night when he comes home 
to tea, 
I 
h8pe they'll always row and fight wherever they may be. 
Perhaps she's, &c. 
I 
hope she'll have a 
lot of hungry, squalling brats to keep, 
I 
hope they'll cry all night, and never let her go to sleep; 
I 
hope her chimneys all may smoke, her lodgers never pay, 
• 
And German bands and organ men annoy her all the day. 
Perhaps she's, (.4:c.

If she is in the railway train, I 
hope that it will smash, 
If up in a 
balloon, I 
hope sh::'11 fall out with a

If on the mid to Salt Lake, then, I 
hope she may get 
drowned, 
Then I 
will get another wife and quickly I'll be bound.

I 
WISH I 
WAS, 
SUNG BY JOHN FLELDUSG. 
I'm not satisfied at all 
With what I 
am, but could 
I 
only be what I 
am not, 
Depend on it I 
would; 
For madly I'm in love, 
As deep as deep can be ; 
But sure enough I 
find to my cost, 
The girl don't care for me. 
I 
wish I 
was a 
bee, 
From her lips to gather honey, 
Or like the great Baron Rothschild, 
With heaps of ready money. 
I 
wish I 
was a 
train, 
Or her Bath chair I 
would be, 
- 
I 
wish I 
was a 
Hansome cab, 
That she could ride in me. 
I 
wish she was the Octopus, 
And she might go to bathe, 
If she should drown I'd stick to 
My loved one's life to save. 
By her hair, or the soles of her feet 
I'dAlrag ray prize in shore; 
I'd live, and love, and die in pace, 
And never go to sea any more. 
I 
wish that she was Tichborne. 
And I 
was the rightful heir, 
I 
wouldn't go to law to know who's who, 
My money she should share; 
I'd wed her with three wedding rings, 
To make her safe and sure ; 
And dress her in the finest things. 
That a 
fellow could procure. 
I 
wish I 
was a 
little belt, 
That clasps her tiny waist, 
Or else the jewel in her hair— 
Which, by-the-by, is paste. 
I 
wish I 
was a 
little puppy dog, 
Put in a 
show for sale, 
And if she would only purchase me, 
Forever I'd wag my tail. 
I 
wish I 
was a 
torn cat, 
And she was a 
tiny mouse, 
And we should be the occupants, 
Of a 
four-roomed empty house; 
If she should run from her hole, 
And try to escape from me, 
If she'd refuse to be my wife 
Then gobbled up siie'd be. 
I 
wish I 
was the Shah, 
With his twenty thousand wives, 
Oh wouldn't I 
then go Harum scarum 
And frighten them out of their lives ; 
Or I 
wish I 
was England's Prince, 
To marry the Russian Maria, 
I'd sail about the sea in ships, 
And set the Thaiiv-q on fire.

THE GALLOPPING HORSE, 
OR, TERRY O'M uLnloax. 
Written and Composed by FREDERIC MAcc.unt. 
Oh! my gallopping horse! 
! 
my gallopping horse! 
I'm at home on the top of my gallopping horse! 
And I 
never can meet 
With a 
tune half so sweet 
As that made by the feet 
Of my gallopping horse; 
As there he goes prancing, 
And hcre he comes dancing, 
And rearing and tearing so proudly and strong. 
It is so delightful, 
And makes me feel quite full 
Of daring, don't caring, while rushing along 
On my gallopping horse, 
On my gallopping horse, 
I'm at home on the top of my gallopping horse; 
And I 
never can meet 
With a 
tune half so sweet 
As that made by the feet 
Of my gallopping horse. 
Oh! my gallopping horse! 
Oh! my gallopping horse! 
There was never his equal for mettle or force; 
He's a 
spirited racer 
And bold steeple- chaser, 
My far-leaping, high-flying, gallopping horse. 
He goes smashing and crashing, 
And splashing and dashing, 
Straight at a 
deep ditch, a 
rough fence, or high wall, 
Not badly, though madly, 
All obstacles gladly, 
That come in his way, he goes full at them all. 
Oh! my ,gallopping horse, th. 
.4161110.4aidt 
27 
Now I'll draw rein with reason, 
And just take my case on 
The back of this wonderful gallopping horse; 
And I'll own I 
was wrong 
When I 
put it so strong, 
That there wasn't his equal for mettle or force; 
There is such another 
That makes as much bother 
In rearing and tearing as ever did mine 
That prances as gladly, 
And dances as madly, 
And who's this nag's owner you'll never divine. 
On his gallopping horse, Ste, 
Each man's hobby, of course, 
Is his gallopping horse ; 
He believes there's no steed with such mettle or force. 
And when he's astride 
Of his hobby, he'll ride 
Just as wildly as I 
do on my hobby-horse; 
If you ever endeavor 
To stop him, you'll never 
Succeed in persuading him out of his course. 
Tie thinks he's so clever, 
No logic whatever 
Can reason him down from his own hobby-horse, 
That's his gallopping horse, 
That's my gallopping horse, 
That's yours, mine, and every man's gallopping horse; 
And we never can meet 
With a 
tune half so swect 
As that made by the feet of our own hobby-horse.

I'VE been thinking of late, I've been thinking. 
Ify thoughts I 
can scarcely define, 
I've been thinking- why people can wonder, 
At this terrible increase of crime; 
Cries, Old Uncle Sam it's a " poser," 
There's a 
something I 
can't understand, 
I 
would just give a 
trifle to know, sir, 
Why crime should increase in our land. 
I'm sure that we've plenty of gold, sir, 
Our banks are as full as can hold, sir, 
We could buy the whole world I 
am told, sirs, 
Yet still, there's an increase of crime. 
It's true what you say, Uncle Samuel, 
We've plenty of gold laid away, 
Mouldy with mildew and rust, sir, 
Guarded by night and by day; 
While you like a 
dog in the manger, 
Your 
to yourself you confine, 
When a 
little would make a 
great change, sir, 
In this terrible increase of crime. 
For expenses you don't care a 
groat, sJr, 
Politicians, you feed a 
whole lot, sir, 
While the poor man, with hunger may rot, It, 
And still you wonder at crime. 
.1 am sure you will own Uncle Sam, sir, 
Temptation is hard to resist, 
Just look at our poor working girl, sirs 
Striving her best to exist • 
Can you wonder at weak constitutions, 
When blood-sucking firms, barely give, 
Enough to keep off destitution, 
A 
girl, though she's poor, she must live. 
There's our poor needle girl, God defend her, 
With feelings as proud and as tender, 
As your proud city lady, remember, 
Uncle Sam can you wonder at crime. 
Can you wonder at crime can you wonder, 
When you see the police on his beat, 
Arresting a 
poor starving man, sir, 
For begging his bread on the street; 
While the thief on the corner stands grinnins 
In the broad open light of the day, 
Your pockets he'd pick for a 
shilling, 
And the law cannot touch himithey say. 
He smiles with contempt and derision, 
He defies a 
whole police division, 
While the poor man is sent off to prison, 
And still you wonder at crime. 
Just think while your drinking your wine, RIF 
How the poor of our land thoy are fed, 
While you, with your rich folks can dine, sir, 
'Tis a 
god-send for them to get bread; 
Go visit the home of the poor, sir, 
Such sights you will never behold, 
To our prisons then go and explore, sir, 
And scatter your hoardings of gold. 
A 
little would soon break asunder, 
The chains the poor sufferer is undw.. 
Go, list to that great voice of hunger, 
And you'll never more wonder at crcai

As sung by TONY Pes-ron. 
THE other night I 
went to bed, 
In fact, I 
often do, 
And in my sleep, went down to the deep, 
Where a 
strange world met my view; 
This world was called Concordia, 
Its people gay and free, 
I 
wished that I 
were one of them, 
Fifty miles under the sea, 
CHORUS. 
This is what I 
saw when dreaming, 
As plain, as plain could Le, 
They were oh so content, they never paid rent, 
Fifty miles under the sea. 
Their food and drink was pure, and not 
Adulterated stuff; 
They'd no Good Templars, for they knew 
When they'd just had enough. 
They'd 110 " blues," partial to running in, 
No Divorce Court had they got, 
And they never read " The Englishinan," 
they were a 
happy lot. 
CII0P.I18. 
This is what I 
saw when dreaming, 
As plain, as plain could 
They'd ne'er had an " Odger," no claimant. Sir Iloger,', 
Fifty miles under the sea. 
They'd never had a 
haLiol.a: 
They never were troubled with wars, 
They never had a 
man for the rates 
Come knock, knock, knock at their doors; 
The toothache, income tax, and corns 
They knew not—happy souls! 
Of railway smashes they'd ne'er heard, 
Nor the price of a 
ton of coals. 
CTIORU61. 
This is what I 
saw when dreaming, 
As plain, as plain could be, 
You may doubt my tale, they'd no workhouse nor jail,. 
Fifty miles under the sea. 
Never a 
one had been known to dread 
The approach of quarter day, 
The mothers-in-law all ived by themselves 
Ten thousand mil( s 
away; 
No pater was troubled with milliners' bills, 
Their children ne-er numbered a 
score, 
You may think it strange, it was wisely arranged 
That each should have two and no more. 
CHORUS. 
This is what I 
saw when dreaming, 
Is plain, as plain could be, 
I 
then heard a 
knock, and its past ten o'clock, 
cume up then from under the sea.

We sat by the river, you and I! 
In the sweet summer time long ago. 
Bo smoothly the water glided by, 
Making music in its tranquil flow; 
We threw two leaflets, you and I, 
To the river, as it wander'd on, 
And one was rent and left to die, 
And the other floated forward all alone, 
And oh! we were sacicie..fd, you and I! 
For we felt that our youth's golden dream 
Might fade, and our lives be sever'd soon, 
As the two leaves were parted in the stream ! 
'Tis years since we parted, you and I! 
In that sweet summer time, long ago. 
And I 
smile as I 
pass the river by, 
And I 
gaze into the shadow depths below. , 
I 
look on the grass and bending reeds, 
And I 
listen to the soothing song, 
And I 
envy the calm and happy life 
Of the river, as it sings and flows along, 
For oh! how its song brings back to me 
The shade of our youth's golden dream! 
In the days ere we parted, you and I, 
As the two leans were parted in the stream

We've landed, just landed, 
We're the two Irish cuckoos

We'll at least be aldermen, 
We will run for big positions;

We'll join the oliticians 
And of course for us you'll vote.

Goes a 
little maiden just as fair as maid could be; 
Like a

nappy as a 
little queen is my darling Dora Dare. 
Mocking all the song birds, as they swtetly 
hear the voice of winsome Dora through the valley ring, 
Waking sweetest echoes thro' the wildwood far and near, 
Waking love-born echoes in the hearts of all who hear. 
CHORUS. 
Sweet Dora Dare, my darling Dora Dare, 
Dora with the lillies of the. 
valley in her hair, 
Darling little Dora, she's the fairest of the fair,

All the laddies are sighing at fair Dora's feet, 
Happy for a 
week at one bright smile of hers so sweet, 
If they think she loves them just because she drops a 
smile, 
They'll soon know that Dora Dare was fooling them the 
while, 
What has passed between us, Dora Dare and I, 
Must be strictly confidential between you and I; 
When the summer comes again my Dora Dare will wear, 
Orange flowers with lilies of the valley in her hair. 
Sweet Dora Dare, fkc.

A 
few years ago, from Ireland we sailed, 
Upon a 
big ship that carries the mail ; 
Niue days from the time that we left the Green Ide, 
We were both landed on American Soil. 
'Twas at Castle Garden we first struck free clay. 
To see the City. we walked up Broadway. 
As we kept walking, the people would stare, 
Remarking, 
Who is that beautiful pair !" 
Cnonus. 
They're Paddies from Cork! 
Paddies from Cork! 
Only just landed in sweet New Yort-,. 
As we walk the street, 
Each one we meet 
Say, " There's two Green Horns, 
They're Paddies from Cork ! " 
Since we have landed, we've traveled a 
bit, 
And have not seen half this country yet 
I've learnt a 
lot, the short time I'm here; 
Yes, he has learnt to drink Lager Beer; 
Yes, and play Billiards and Bagatelle ; 
And smoke his Cigar just like a 
swell ! 
Some day. of this City I 
may he Mayor. Misa, 
Then I 
shall be known as the Mayore.-43 
We're not from Cork, but the City Dublin. ; 
And she to the world has give some Lra men. 
In Ireland to-day, in almost any part 
You'll find many the man eq+:ally as -:triart. 
But the Government that rules won't kt them rise, 
So what they possess. of course with hem (lies. 
Some, who's good fortune is to get to New York, 
Are greeted, wlin lam14?d, fe4 Paddies from Cork!

WHEN THESE OLD CLOTHES WERE NEW 
EIGHT years ago, I 
looked a 
swell, sirs, 
With walking cane, and purse as long, 
I 
quizzed the ladies in the street, sirs, 
Alas, that game did not last long, 
I 
married got, to my misfortune, 
From that day every penny flew, 
For soon I 
spent the marriage portion, 
On my wedding-day these clothes were new. 
We went to church, so blythe and merry, 
This hat of mine was new and light, 
We drank our crusted port and sherry, 
And ev'ry eye was beaming bright. 
But you, poor hat, can tell the hisCry 
Of where we go and what we do, 
But how you stand it is a 
myst'ry— 
Think of the days when you were new. 
And you, poor coat, have got quite seedy, 
I 
never cuffed you, speak the truth, 
You cannot say that I 
was greedy, 
I 
filled your pockets, yes, forsooth; 
For ev'ry morning you I 
studied. 
And after dinner open threw, 
And seldom were you skirts e'er muddied, 
I 
kept a 
trap when you were new. 
And you, poor boots, were bright as any, 
You really were a 
lovely pair, 
Cleaning you've cost many a 
penny, 
I 
took you with me errywhere, 
But farewell to the soles departed— 
For my poor toes they do peep through— 
And you, poor tops, look quite faint-hearted, 
flow different now, than you were new. 
And yOu poor gloves, my hands did shelter, 
Yet'still I 
hen you in ivy love, 
We through the werld went helter skelter, 
Like true friends, living hand and glove. 
But farewell clothes, we part too soon.

COURTING IN THE RAIN. 
ONE April morn, when walking down, 
A 
quiet country lane, 
I 
overtook a 
fair young girl, 
Whilst hurrying through the rain. 
I 
asked her " If she would accept 
My arm and take a 
share 
Of my umbrella ?" " Thanks, kind Sir, 
I 
will," replied the fair. 
SPOKEN.—One with golden locks, by Jove, and without otie 
of those useful 
articles ( holding up Umbrella)--when she 
-)opped her little iu re in mine, my heart beat to that degree it 
early dislocated my rIns (Gine Umbrella I 
mean*/ it's a 
fact I 
thought to myself, here's a 
chance, to go— 
CHORUS. 
Courting in the rain, courting in the rain,

ne'er regret the day I 
met my charmer in the lawn

Whilst courOng Mary Jan( 
The rain poured down alarmingly, 
When to a 
tree we came, 
And shelter took beneath it: 
There I 
quickly learnt her name. 
3ha also told me where she lived, 
With Pa Clown at the farm, 
k. farmer's daughter: well, said I, 
That is an extra charm.

SPOKEN. —I 
glory In country life, an a 
farmer% daughter.... 
what could be better ? I 
wished the rain would keep on as fi 
taller liked— 
Courting in the rain, &c. 
At length the rain abated, 
And the sun shone out quite bright, 
The little birds began to sing, 
My heart it felt so light— 
I 
gently pressed her arm in mine, 
And said: " Now don't say nay, 
Ent let me come and meet you here 
Again, some other day." 
SPOTIEN.—" Well, she said, I 
can't exactly decide, you must 
ask my Pa—" So I 
made up my mind to go in and inform th3 
old gentleman we'd been 
Courting in the rain, ttc. , 
We reached the old farm-house, and than 
She introduced to me 
Her Pa, a 
jollv nice old boy, 
With him I 
made quite free: 
I 
told him where and when I'd met, 
His daughter in the rain, 
And bleitaed the lucky chance that took 
Me down that country lane— 
Srogms.—The old gentleman was quite delighted with my 
kind attention, null soon gained his consent, which proves the 
truth of the old proverb—" it never rains out it pours," and ge

Macoabes's Excursion Train. 
OR, THE TRIALS OF A 
RAILWAY PORTER. 
'Am.—" King of the Canibal 
Ever since the world began. 
There never was, nor ever can 
Be found such a 
very useful man 
As a 
railway porter. 
He carries your luggage civilly, 
And never expects to get a 
fee. 
Though his hand will close quite readily 
If you slip in a 
small gratuity. 
When friends are on the platform parting, 
He rings the bell when it's time for starting, 
And the last man you see, as away you're darting, 
Is the railway porter. 
VENTRILOQUIAL CONVERSATION WITH THE PASSENGFRA 
Starting the Train—Right !—Train off—Incidents of Rail-
way Travel—Pleasant and Unpleasant Fellow-passengers— 
Arrival at Station—Pull Up. 
And when the train is pulling up, 
At a 
station on the line to stop, 
And the passengers want to know how far 
They've come, and wonder where they are ; 
The porter shouts the name of the station, 
But you only hear the termination, 
So on that point you never get information 
From the railway porter. 
VErrnruporrAL CONVERSATION. — 1 
he Fat Old Gentleman 
who wants more Room—The Loquacious Old Lady who is 
anxious about her Luggage—The Young Swell who wants 
to Smoke, and the Asthmatical Gentlman who objects— 
The Tipsy Man who wants the Refreshment Station— 
And the Yankee who chaffs the Porter. 
So ever since the world began, 
There never was, nor ever can 
Be found such a 
very useful man 
As a

The Hero of my humble song 
Was once a

A

But when he found in course of time 
The tricks his friends did play,

Of the boys on Patrick's day; 
But now the cry is everywhere, 
Mulcahy's gone away! 
He won our pride and won our praise, 
And he deserved it too ! 
Sure many a

We know not where to seek for him; 
He must have crossed the say ;

Mulcahy's gone away! 
He was great, &4. 
He treated us like gintlemen 
Whenever we did meet ; 
The sight of him would do you good, 
From his head down to his feet; 
He wore a 
collar stiff and high, 
Which made a 
great display; 
He was a 
most distinguished man— 
But now he's gone away! 
He was great, &e. 
The girls went crazy when he winked, 
And many an artful plan 
They put in operation for 
To catch this darlin' man ; 
But now they're left alone, poor things; 
They weep and wail, and say— 
Oh, what'll we do at all? 
Mulcahy's gone away!

A dog the old woman saw walking past, 
When she'd waited a 
little while: • 
Dear do-', said she. will you bite my pig, 
And make it go over the stile. 
Oh, my. was the old woman's cry, 
She was in a 
dreadful plight; 
Dog, dog, bite pig, 
Pig won't get over the stile, 
And 
never get home to night. 
3. 
The dog looked up at the dame and smiled, 
But politely declined the job: 
When the dame by her side, a 
stick descried 
And asked it to beat the dog. 
Oh, my, was the old Ivoman's cry, 
She was in a 
dreadful plight; 
Stick, stick, beat dog, dog won't bite pig, 
Pig won't get over the stile, 
And I'll never get home to night. 
4. 
The stick then replied, pray excuse me, old dame 
For I 
feel so lazy and thicl; 
'When the old woman saw a 
blazing fire, 
And be,o,red it \void(' burn the stick. 
Oh, my, was the old woimin's cry, 
She was in a 
dreadful plight; 
Fire, lire, burn stick, stick won't beat dog, 
Dog won't bite pig. 
Pig won't gut over the stile, 
And I'll never get home to night. 
5. 
Said the fire. the stick is so large and thick, 
Of Inv job very soon I 
should tire; 
When the dame discovered some water near, 
And praed it would quench the fire. 
Oh, my. was the old woman's cry, 
She was in a 
dreadful plight; 
Water, water. quench tire. 
Fire won't burn stick, stick won't beat dog, 
Dog won't bite pig. 
Pig won't get over the stile, 
And I'll never get home to night.

6. 
The water said, Madam, I 
beg to decline, 
For I 
don't see why I 
oughter; 
When seeing an Ox, a 
taking a 
walk, 
She begged it would drink the water. 
0, my, was the old woman's cry, 
Ox, ox, drink water, water won't quench fire, 
Fire won't burn stick, stick 'won't beat dog, 
Dog won't bite pig, 
Pig won't get over the stile, 
And I'll never get home to night 
7. 
The Ox said, old womar, I'll do no such thing 
Such a 
deed my teehne• shocks: 
When a 
butcher passin,, the dame entreated 
That he would kill the ox. 
Oh, my, was the old woman's cry, 
She was in a 
dreadful plight:

Water won't quench tire, 
Fire won't hum stick, stick won't beat dog,

8. 
The butcher then answered, with pleasure, dear dame,. 
For the ox to you has been rude; 
I'll kill it dame, and cut it up, 
For I 
know it will make good food. 
Oh, my, was the old wonlzill'S cry 
Recovering from her fright, 
For the butcher began to kill the ox, 
The ox began to drink the water, 
The water began to quench the fire,

YOU NEVER MISS THE WATEE TILL THE, 
WELL RUNS DRY 
WHEN a 
child I 
lived at Lincoln with my parents at the farm, 
The lessons that my mother taught to me were quite a 
charm
he  ; 
would often take me on her knee when tired of childish 
play, 
And as she pressed me to her breast I've heard my mothet 
say— 
Waste not, want not, is a 
maxim Itwould teach; 
Let your watchword be " dispatch," and practice what you 
preach; 
Do not let your chances, like sunbeams, pass you by, 
For you never miss the water till the well runs dry. 
As years roll'd on I 
grew to be a 
mischief-making boy, 
Destruction seem'd my only sport, it was my only joy; 
And well do I 
remember, when ofttimes well chastised, 
How father sat beside me then and thus has me advised. 
Waste not, & c. 
When I 
arrived at manhood, I 
embark'd in public life, 
And found it was a 
rugged road bestrewn with care and strife ; 
I 
speculated foolishly. my losses were severe, 
But still a 
tiny, little voice kept whisp'ring in mine ear. 
Waste not, Sc. 
Then I 
studied strict economy, and found, to my surprise, 
3Iy funds, instead of sinking, very quickly then did rise, 
I 
eTasp'd each chance and 
al
ways 
struck 
the iron while ' twas 
-  
hot, 
I 
Seiz'd my opportunita and never once forgot— 
Waste not, &c, 
Im' married now and happy , I've a 
careful little wife, 
We live in peace and harmony, devoid of care and strife; 
Fortune smiles upon us, we have little children three, 
The lessons that I 
teach 1...ora, as ti‹: prattle round may knee

It is the Fac-simile of a Trick practised by alt,

in an unfailing source of amusement.

leading Journal says of it: 
" 
An ingenious little book of the thaumaturgic order has 
been sent us called HUMPTY DU31PTY,' and Pound in such a 
;way as to give opportunity for a decidedly puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary appearance of a 
child's picture-
book •

prac-
tised maniF-ls.tor taking it up and fli rt
ing the leaves rapidly 
over, can mak: t 
appear to be filled with copies of only one 
picture. or wi11 blank pages, or with any one of quite a 
suc-
cession of figures. 
One minute the pamphlet, quickly thumb-
ed, appears to contain nothing but the portraits of Harlequin, 
in nis tesselated suit: the next, only Columbine , 
then, 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or Alephistophiles.

LOT TE TEMPLE, oyed with her in her early pleasures, sym-
pathized and wept with her in her sorrows, and glowed 
with indignation at the wrongs which she suffered from 
base, calculating villains, an opportunity is afforded of 
reading one of the most absorbing works ever written, 
proving " truth stranger than 
etion." 
The poet's lines are but a 
just description of the unfor 
tunate Charlotte Temple: 
Her form was faultless, and her mind, 
Untainted yet by art, 
Was noblv, just, humane and kind, 
And virtue warmed her heart. 
But, ah! the cruel spider came—" 
This book, in the language of Mrs. Rowson, " affords n 
Eriking example that vice, however prosperous in the be-
ginning, in the end leads only to misery and shame."

U8Y TEMPLE, 
THE DAUGHTER OF CHARLOTTE TEMPLE. 
No one who has read the touching account of the 
misfortunes of Charlotte Temple, with that absorb-
ing interest which is inseparable from Mrs. Bow-
son's writings, can rest satisfied while denying them-
selves a 
perusal cf the life of Charlotte Temple's 
Daughter, Lucy Templc. 
It is a 
sequel possessed of all the thrilling in-
terest that characterizes the life of the -unfortunate 
mother, while it exemplifies in a 
wonderful manner 
" 
the visitation of the sins of the parents upon the 
children." 
It ,depicts sorrows that refuse the balm of sym-
pathy, and consolations which those around us 
" 
can neither give nor take away." 
It contrasts in 
living colors the richest fruits of virtue and happi-
ness on the one hand, and the bitter end, blighting 
disappointments and rzzir resulting from once yielf.1-
ing to the seductive influence of passion. 
It points a 
moral that commends it to the atten-
tion of all, and is pervaded by an interest that will 
hold the reader in rapt attention to the 'end.

THE APPRENTICE, 
on 
First Book for Mechanics, Machinists & Engineers 
By OLIVER BYRNE. 
12mo., cloth. $ 1.50. 
ENDORSEMENTS OF THE PRESS. 
The highest praise which can be given to this excellent 
elementary work on practical mechanics, consists in the fol-
lowing simple statement of facts: The editor of this journal, 
while teaching natural philosophy and chemistry in the 
Cooper Institute from 1859 to 1864, was in need of a 
text-
book of practical mechanics, adapted to the advanced classes 
who had been trained in mathematics; in his search among 
the many mechanical text-books, there was not one which so 
fully answered his requirements as the above work. 
It was 
therefore adopted and used with perfect satisfaction, and it 
is with pleasure that he receives it now as an old friend from 
the publishers, gives it his most ea-nest recommenthtion, 
and wishes it in the hands of all who are still in the fog about 
the units of 'work, calculation of the power of machinery, 
re‘istance to motion, 9train on material, etc.—Manufacturer 
and Buitder, July, 1874. • 
Elie author of this work is well known as an extensive 
vr:iter who has made some valuable additions to American 
technical literature, enumerated above in detail. 
The work 
we are now noticing is a 
theoretical treatise on practical me-
chanics, designed to supply a 
recognized deficiency. 
Most 
of the works on mechanics treat the subject in a manner 
which is not available to young men commencing as appren-
tices in shops. 
Any young man with a 
fair knowledge of 
arithmetic may, however, use this work to great advantage ; 
it is not only suitable for a 
text-book, but also as a \yolk 
of reference. 
Most ambitious young men will make them-
selves so familiar with its contents as to be able to ider 
readily to any portieu of the book. 
The author has adopted 
a 
new notation to distinguish units of work from other units, 
which is not without value, and might b<1 advantageously 
introduced into more ambitious works. 
Tli,; book is well 
printed on good white paper, and bound in still cloth covers.
