For, sure there's a 
charm, love, about you, 
Whenever I 
know you are nigh. 
Like the beam of the star when 'tis smiling, 
Is the glance which your eye can't conceal, 
And your voice is so sweet and beguiling, 
That I 
love you, sweet Norah O'Neal. 
Oh ! don't think that ever I'll doubt you, 
My love I 
will never conceal; 
Oh ! I'm lonely to-niolt, love, without you, 
My darling sweet Norah O'Neal I 
Oh ! the nightingale sings in the wild-wood, 
As if every note that he knew 
Was learned from your sweet voice in childhood, 
To remind me, sweet Norah, of you ; 
But I 
think, love, so often about you. 
And you don't know how happy I

Oh ! why should I

Or why to let hope los') its place? 
Won't I

And smile on your beautiful face ? 
Will you meet me ? 
Oh ! say, will you meet me

That I'll never be lonely again.

REPLY TO NOILkII O'NEAL. 
IS 
it lonely ye are then without me ? 
Only \wait, and 1il come bye-and- bye : 
For meselt's just entirely as lonely, 
And, Daring, I 
give sigh for sigh. 
If the glance of my eye's like the star, love, 
If my voice sweetly sounds on your ear. 
In your own looks of love my eyes brighten, 
And my voice tender grows vhn you're near. 
CHORUS. 
Is it lonely ye are then without me ? 
Only wait, and I'll come bye-and bye : 
For, meself's just entirely as lonely, 
And, Darling, I 
give sigh for sigh. 
Sure, the nightingale's notes are delightful, 
When he warbles, at night in the wood : 
And if birds taught us colleen's love's language, 
He's the sweet little Birdie that could : 
Bat it wasn't from him I 
learnt sin trintr 
Not from nightingale, no : nor from dove ;

She knows, Dennis dear, that you love her, 
And, Dennis, you know that she loves you : 
And would ye then wait till to-morrow ? 
While the moon shines in heaven so bright, 
And the lane and the kiss so convanient,

Of the ups and downs in Ireland, 
Sinca the year of Ninety-Eight. 
But if that nation had its own, 
Her noble sons might stay at home; 
But since fortune has it otherwise, 
Poor Pat must emigrate. 
The devil a 
word I 
would say at all, 
Although our wages are but small, 
If they left us in our cabins, 
Where our fathers drew their breath; 
When they called upon rent-day, 
And the divil a 
c 
nit you have to pay, 
They will drive you from your house and home, 
To beg and starve to death. 
What kind of treatment, boys is that 
To give an honest Irish Pat? 
To drive his family to the road, 
To bee- and starve for meat ? 
But I 
stood up with heart and hand, 
And sold my little spot of lend ; 
That is the reason why I 
left, 
And had to emigrate. 
Such sights as that I've often seen ; 
But / saw ‘vorse in Skibareen. 
In Forty-Eight (that time is no mo:e) 
When famine it was great : 
I 
saw fathers, boys, and girls! 
With rosy cheeks and silken curls, 
All a-missine-, 
and starving 
For a 
mouthful of food to eat. 
When they died itt Skibareen, 
No shroud or coffins were to be seen; 
But pati-ntly reconciling themselves 
To their desperate, horrid fate. 
They were Virown in graves by wholesale, 
Which caused many an Irish heart to wail. 
And caused many a 
boy and girl 
To be most glad to emigrate.

And beat her foes wherever seen :

If You please, come tell me that: 
We have pursued the Indian Chief,

Who skivered babes and mothers, 
And left them in their gore. 
But why should we be so oppressed. 
In the land Saint Patrick b:essed?

Since they took our Liberator,

The Mabel Waltz. 
Ara :---" Naval Waltz." 
I 
on 
ail know a 
pretty girl, 
She dressed so very neat ; 
&le used to run a 
sewing- machine, 
Down in Chatham Street. 
Her eye re bright, complexion light, 
Her cheeks were like the rose ; 
She'd a 
dimple chin, end pouting lips, 
And a 
beautiful turn- up nose. 
I 
never can forget the night 
I 
met her at a 
ball: 
'Twos it fancy hop, a 
dollar a 
head, 
Up at Irving Hall. 
CHORUS: 
She looked so neat, I 
never thought 
She ever would prove nlSe; 
Her step was light as the bounding fawn, 
Dancing the Mabel Waltz. 
I 
often met her after that, 
Of tender things we talked ; 
And every Sunday out of two, 
I'd take her out to walk.

I 
bought her lots of diamonds, 
At a-dollar-jewelry store. 
And also bought her a 
new silk dress, 
Which every day she wore. 
In buying presents for that girl, 
I 
all my money spent, 
Until I 
found myself dead-broke, 
And I 
hadn't got a 
cent. 
She looked, &c. 
And. then, I 
thought ' twas getting time 
The question for to top. 
I 
went, one day, dressed in my best, 
Strain- lit down to the shop : 
She didn't come; I 
asked the cause, 
And learned from one Miss Brown 
My charmer had, that very day, 
'Just gone out of town. 
Judge my feelings: when Miss Brown 
These cruel words let slip; 
It's my opinion she's gone off 
Upon her wedding trip. 
She looked, &c. 
And when a 
year had passed away, 
At a 
window I 
did see 
My fair, but false one sitting 
With a 
baby on her knee. 
I 
quickly marched into the house, 
And, there, what met my view 
'Twits a

Killmurrymacmahon's a 
place you would bless, 
Where whiskey costs nothing, and buttermilk 
less : 
And it's near to that same is a 
neat little spot, 
Where my grandfather's grandfather dwelt in his 
cot; 
Whose children, from Denis to Terrence and Pat, 
Each stuck up a 
peer for a 
traveller's hat. 
For 'twos land of their own where the Murphys first 
grew, 
And they all were descended from Brien Born. 
In our garden, to charm both the eye and the nose, 
Nature always seem'd drest in her holiday clothes, 
And so sweet was the smell of the whiskey we 
brew 1d, 
That pig in the parlour wou'd smnetimes intrude. 
Then at the assize, I've ta'en up a 
broom 
To leather a 
cow nem' the Counsellor's room ; 
For we let off a 
chamber, as other folks do, 
Who may not be descended from Brien Born. 
But sweetest of all, was that beautiful maid, 
At the door of whose cabin I've oft left my spade ; 
From the window she'd peep, like a 
sly fairy elf, 
Crying, mister Kilrooney, get out wid yourself— 
If you stop till I 
open the wicket my dear, 
I'll be making a 
noise which nobody can hear— 
Then I 
always behav'd, as all gentlemen do. 
Who 
like me are descended from Brien Boru 
Why are you Weeping. 
Why are you weeping, dear mother, 
When I

Is the same Providence, mother, 
Watching no more o'er me?

Think of the lesson you taught me, 
E'en in my earliest years; 
Practice their precepts, dear mother, 
And they will calm your fears. 
Have I 
not seen you watching. 
Oft from the storm-lash'd shore. 
When the lighning dart was flashing 
Felted you the thunder's roar 
When for my father's danger 
I 
like a 
child have wept : 
Do you not say that in heaven, 
Watch o'er his life was kept 2 
Be of good cheer, dear mother.

At last she consented, I

seemed to Inc a

wished it had been twenty long mile. •

" 
They tell me that both are asleep in the tomb. 
The gipsy is kind, but my mother was fonder, 
She sang me so sweetly to rest in her arms; 
But now she is gone, and her darling must wan-
der 
Though the soft words she wispered my bosom'

" 
And soon will I

And take my best flowers to plant by their side, 
That summer, when all their ;bright tints are un-

May bless the green turf with their heautrand

And so to do I

But oh ! it seems I 
never shall, 
I've so unlucky been. 
My name's a 
nice one—Fanny Good— 
It looks well in a 
letter, 
Now who would change the name of Good 
Unless ' twere for a 
better. 
My Pa and Ma they scold and fret, 
But I

Although from morn till night they ask

I 
had a 
beau—I 
liked him too, 
At Fort Lee 't 
was we met, 
His whiskers were Dundreary ones, 
Their color black as jet, 
Mamma and Pa went out one day, 
Left us at home quite snug, he 
Went down upon his knees and said, 
" 
Will you be Mrs. Buggey 9" 
That such a 
nice young man should have 
A name like that's a 
shame, 
I 
toll him " No," and yet they ask, 
Why don't I 
change my name? 
" 
The course of true love never did 
Ron smooth," they do declare, 
Another beau I 
found, thought I, 
I 
need not yet despair. 
He wrote fine sonnets to my eyes, 
He brought me ellarmine• books, 
But when he did propose, I 
found ; 
His name was Mr. Snooks. 
Of course I 
cried, and told hlm lie 
Must go from whence he came, 
And yet they tease me still and say, 
Why don't I 
change_ my name? 
'Twas at a 
ball, just after that, 
A 
partner I 
did gain, 
He pressed my hand, and how he sighed 
When we did ' ladies' chain," 
He called next day—again—again, 
At last, thought I, he'll speak, 
I 
felt ashamed when out it came, 
" 
Sweet love, be Mrs. Cheek l" 
Upon my qbeek I 
felt the blush, 
it must have glowed like flame 
I'm single still—and still they say, 
Why don't I 
change my name ?

" 
I've got a 
most important case which really can-
not wait, 
Perhaps you'll send for the Crowner and the big-
gest Magistrate." 
He said " I 
will." and so next day to court I 
brought the sack, 
The place was very crowded, so I shouted out 
" 
stand back !" 
I 
said, " Behold the victim I" and I 
cut the sack 
lengthwise, 
And out rolled the corpse of a 
donkey, dead, to 
their astonished eyes. 
They burst out laughing, judge and all, and fun of 
me did make, 
The Crowner thro' his goggles looked, and said, 
" 
Here's some mistake," 
Says I, " I 
think there is, confound that cook and

So off I 
bolted, cut my throat—I

Black Eyes or Blue. 
Black eyes or blue, black eyes or blue, 
Which the most lovely, most brilliant and bright ? 
Those softly beaming with heavenly hue, 
Or those shining out like the stars of the night ? 
Each in its turn plays a 
mischievous part, 
Why then dispute what its colour may be; 
Both own a 
language that speaks to the heart, 
Give me the eyes that speaks only to me. 
Some love the blue for their temperate glow, 
Some love the black for their brilliance and fire; 
If but for me, when their tears gently flow, 
What is there more that I 
need to desire? 
Love from the eyes shoots his mischievous dart, 
Nor heeds he what colour his arrows may be ; 
From black eyes or blue they go straight to the 
heart. 
Then give me the eyes that look kindly on me.

The Norah O'Neal 
The Good-tempered Man. 
What a 
pity to hear some people declare, 
That life is a 
burden of sorrow and care; 
I've lived forty years in this valley of tears, 
And of troubles I've had a 
full share, 
And I 
find it is wiser to laugh than to cry, 
And merrily sing if you can, 
Clouds that are dark may clear bye-and-bye,1 
So laugh like a 
good-tempered-man, 
Ha! ha! ha! 
I 
was always a 
good-tempered-man. 
My courting I 
paid to a 
fair pretty maid, 
When I 
ask'd her to wed she lovingly said, 
" 
Dear Daniel, it's true I'm faithful to you, 
Believe me and don't be afraid ;" 
But in less than a 
month her promise she broke, 
And off with another she ran; 
I 
laugled and treated it all as a 
joke, 
For I'm such a 
good- tempered-man, 
Ha! ha ! ha! 
Oh! I'm such a 
good-tempered man. 
A mob in the street I 
happened to meet, 
A 
thief with a 
snatch ran away with my watch, 
My hat with surprise was knocked over my eyes, 
Crying " Stop thief I" the people all ran; 
But I 
never moved an inch from the spot, 
But to laugh and dance I 
began, 
To think what a 
guy at that moment I 
look'd, 
Oh! l'm such a 
good-tempered man, 
Ha ha ! ha I 
Oh! I'm such a 
good-tempered man. 
Then never give way to that demon dismay, 
if to-day you are down and acquaintances frown, 
To-morrow may bring quite a 
different thing, 
And life's but a 
flash in the pan: 
If care as they tell us once killed the poor cat, 
Though scarcely believe it I 
can, 
Like me you are bound to get jolly and fat, 
Ha! ha! 
I 
was always a 
good-tempered man.

I 
met him at a

Attention so pertailer to me be did show, 
I 
was dressed like a 
nurrshoness in muslin delaine, 
By the young man on the railway, who drove the 
mail train. 
Oh, my misery's, &c.

And never would do anything to make my heart 
pain, 
Oh the young man on the railway who drove the 
mail train. 
Oh, my misery's, &c. 
One day there came a 
postman with a 
rat-tat, 
It made my poor heart beat with a 
pit-ty-pat, 
For it said, " I 
am married, so farewell!. Anne 
Jane," 
Oh the young man on the railway who drove the 
mail train.

Or the biter abustin with misery and pain, 
Thro' that young man on the railway that drives 
the mail train. 
Oh, my misery's, &c. 
Thou Art Not What Once Thou Wert. 
Thou art not what once thou wert, 
Thy form no longer glads mine eye, 
Thou sheddest o'er this broken heart 
No light, save that of memory; 
Yet though thus distant, not unseen, 
Though absent, not belov'd the less, 
How'er betray'd my hopes have been 
This heart still loves—these lips still bless. 
I 
see thee when my burning brow 
Throbs with those visions of unrest, 
Which float above my couch of pain, 
To tell me that I 
have been blest.

Thou art not here—thou art not here— 
My best, my only lov'd one, now, 
Thou canst not check this burning tear, 
Thou canst not cool this burning brow.

And more belov'd-0 love may be 
Enshrin'd within a

Of my youth's spring was wild and free.

The sea is bold Columbia's 
And Columbia's shall remain, 
While Columbia's have hearts of oak, 
Her freedom to maintain ; 
And as her gallant vessels sail 
Amid the foaming tide, 
It bears them up as if it knew, 
It nursed Columbia's pride. 
CHORUS, 
So sing we ever boldly, 
With honest might and main, 
The sea is bold Columbia's 
And Columbia's shall remain.

The Hardware Line. 
Yes, my old dad was a 
money-making notary, 
And sipping his wine has often told, 
That woman was a 
riddle and marriage a 
lottery, 
And wives at the altar were bought and sold. 
His reason for that I 
cannot divine, 
For it was not the case with this wife of mine, 
She'd a 
father and a 
mother, and a 
sister and a 
brother, 
And they all got a 
living in the hardware line. 
The words that he uttered caused quite a 
panic, 
In my youthful mind, I 
soon did decide, 
To cut broadcloth, and in the garb of a 
mechanic, 
From the unwashed multitude seek a 
bride. 
'Twas there I 
found this girl of mine, 
When I 
laid my heart at Cupid's shrine. 
She'd a 
father and a mother, and a 
sister and a 
brother, 
And they alt got a 
living in the hardware line. 
Her brother was a gunsmith, her sister was a 
burnisher,

Her mother made buttons at three-pence a

Her father he plated harness furniture, 
She kept the books of profit and loss ; 
Three months for her did I 
waste and pine,

That all mot a

She's a

My days they pass in one round of pleasure. 
I 
feel ns if I 
should never grow old, 
For a 
wife that is a 
priceless treasure, 
And more to a 
man than silver and gold. 
Far better than a

2So. . The Demon 
of the Desert. 
This book is one of the most powerfully 
exciting 
novels 
ever written. 
The 
scenes are laid in the laud of the rifle, 
tI-.omahawk and the scalping-knife, 
'Terrible 
adventures crimson almost 
every page. 
No. 2. Prairie Pete; or, Tho 
Trapper's Avenger. 
Of all the tales of 
wild adventure in forest and prairie 
this is the most excellent. The reader 
seems to actually hear the yell of the 
demon red- skins, sees 
their painted 
faces, and witnesses the lurid flames of 
the frontier log cabin. 
No. 3. Wild Bill, the Indian 
Slawr• Wild Bill, who is an inveter-
ate hater of the Indians. 
Re never 
walks out of the house without a 
brace 
of fine revolvers slung to his waist, and 
woe to the Indians that cross his path. 
No. 4. The Death Trail. Vividly 
are these pages filled with the doings of 
the terrible Regulators of Arkansas. 
Some of these incidents are fearfully 
terrific, such as the vigil of the Indian 
by the corpse of his wife, and his awful 
revenge upon her slayer, in the ruined 
wigwam. 
No. 5. Grey-E'yed Luke. Every 
page of this thrilling book is full of in-
cident. 
The characters are natural, 
the actions life-like and full of daring. 
The hot sun of Sonora fills their veins 
and excites them to deeds of despera-
tion. No book of its class can begin to 
compare with it. 
No. G. Six- Shooter Jim. This 
book will find readers as long as there 
exists a 
taste for the wild, the terrible, 
and the sanguinary. It is a 
truthful 
picture of real life as it exists upon the 
frontiers where the revolver, meets the 
rifle, the tomahawk and scalping knife. 
No. 7. The Wrecker's Victim. 
This Story is terribly interesting. The 
daughter of the iron- hearted smuggler 
and the wrecker is one of the loveliest 
maidens that ever pressed foot on sea-
sand. Rer admirers were many among 
the ruffians that surround her—ruffians 
more cruel than the awful waves that 
dash on the wreck-strewn shore by 
which she lives. 
No. S. The Storm Child. The 
dark caverns that honey-comb the storm 
lashed shores of Cornwall witness terri-
ble crimes in their recesses. 
Smugglers, 
aye, and red-handed pirates, are the ac-
tors who seek by the fiercest means to 
perpetrate terrible and unholy crimes. 
[ovEn.1 
De Witt's Ten Cent Romances continued. 
No. 9. Captain Bob, the Moun-
tain Devil. A 
few years ago there 
dwell in the almost impenetrable reces-
ses of the Ozark Mountains, a 
wretch 
whose name was a 
terror to the inhabi-
tants of the surrounding region. 
With 
his band of outlaws, Indians and cut-
throats, he made raids upon the outlying 
plantations, plundered them, and, if op-
position were attempted, arson and mur-
der were added to the other dark deeds. 
No. 10. Wile, Pill's _First Trail. 
Is a 
plain recital of the first of the many 
advoitures in which this daring Indian 
Fighter, Buffalo Hunter, Trapper and 
Union Guide, was an actor. The story 
is told by himself; and is very entertain 
ing. 
No. 11. Sant Sutton, the Scalp 
Taker. In this bock figure many of 
the Indians who are now making the 
Great Plains is " dark and bloody 
ground." Sam will be readily recogniz-
ed as a 
real character by all our officers 
who have been stationed in the Indian 
country.. 
No. 12. The Crandi»g Snake. 
This famous Scout and Indian Scalper , 
went far ahead of the most cunning In-
dian in 
tricks and stratagems. 
Re 
could crawl right through the best 
watched camp, and knife an Indian in 
the heart of his encampment. 
No. 13. Big _Lige; or, The Red 
Cloud of the Soshones. The best of good 
stories. 
It tells of a 
young hunter who 
found a 
brave Indian- slayer wounded 
to death: he succors him, and receives 
his blessing and his rifle. When he 
himself is attacked Big Lige comes to 
his aid. 
No. 14. Zoph Slaughter. A Scout 
with the eye of a 
hawk and a 
heart of 
steel—with a 
wit keen as his scalping-
knife. 
A love story runs its silver 
cord through the blood- stained tissue. 
No. la. Leathers:fan; or, The 
Prairie Guide. This well-hnown Scout 
was an odd mixture of Kit Carson and 
Old Adams the grizzly-tamer; and 
could out-ride, out- shoot and out-fight 
the tallest 
red-skin that ever took a 
white man's scalp. 
No: 16—Mark-Beard. This fero-
cious pirate, who seemed to love crime 
for its own sake, was one oi the most 
skillful sailors that ever took hie " trick 
at the helm ;" and his terrible deeds are 
lis'ened to with a 
strange interest in the 
fo'castle, when the wind is " blowing 
great guns." 
No. / 7. Adelaide, the Avenger. 
How a 
young, lovely and innocent girl, 
followed the fortunes of a 
black- hearted 
corsair, ( seeking to avenge the wrongs 
inflicted on her lover) is fully told in 
these pages. Amid toe hushed calm or 
the feartel storm, thc fair girl follows 
the wretch like the figure of doom.

Trader.
