Madeleine Hall-Arber: There we go okay [laughing]. Okay so I'm going to give a little formal 
introduction first. This is an interview for the New Bedford Fishing Heritage Center funded by 
Archie Green Fellowship from the Library of Congress. As part of this project we're interviewing 
shore side workers in the New Bedford/ Fairhaven Fishing Industry to record their stories, 
document their skill and knowledge, and better understand their important role in the fishing 
industry. Both the recording and transcript will become part of the permanent collection at the 
Library of Congress. I'm Madeleine Hall-Arber and today I'm speaking with Debra Kelsey at the 
Fishing Partnership Support Services in New Bedford and the time is about 11 o'clock. So you 
did give us permission to record this, right? 
Debra Kelsey: Yes I do. 
MHA: Okay. Can you introduce yourself? 
DK: So I'm Deb Kelsey and I'm a navigator here at the Fishing Partnership Support Service 
office in New Bedford. 
MHA: Okay great. When and where were you born? 
DK: So I was bom in 1967 right here in the city of New Bedford. Born and raised. 
MHA: Do you come from a fishing family? 
DK: I do not come from a fishing family. Ironically, growing up in New Bedford, I really didn't 
know much about the fishing industry as a young girl; it was only in my adult life that I started to 
become more and more aware of our fishing industry that was so big here in the city of New 
Bedford. So, you would think that being born and raised here I would have known about 
fishermen from the get-go but for some reason that wasn't— I didn't learn about fishing or 
fishermen in school. I didn't learn about it from my immediate family. And it took getting to my 
adult life for— before I realized there was this great big industry here that supported my city, my 
community, and the people I care about. 
MHA: So what is your— did your family come from New Bedford originally? 
DK: No, so actually mom is from Puerto Rico and she moved here with her parents when she 
was 12 and so she attended school here and my dad is from a surrounding town but I didn't grow 
up with my dad, I grew up with my mom in a Puerto Rican household and culture. So, I don't 
know if that was part of the reason— maybe they didn't know about the industry, not being from 
here. 
MHA: So did you grow up speaking Spanish? 
Interview with Debra Kelsey, January 5, 2017

DK: We did. We actually, when I was in the fourth grade my mom moved us, my three brothers 
and myself, we actually moved to Puerto Rico for a year and that's where we really learned to 
read, write and speak Spanish at home. My mom would speak to my grandparents in Spanish but 
she would speak to us in English so we did pick up words. Sometimes my grandmother would 
start speaking to me in English and then she'd cross over to Spanish or the other way around so 
we did grow up having a second language. 
MHA: So did that— has that helped you here because I know there's a fairly large Spanish¬ 
speaking population thaf s moved into New Bedford. 
DK: I think what helped— I think it helps me with all different cultures. It helps me to understand 
that not everybody is brought up the same, with the same beliefs or the same way of handling 
situations. So I think it has helped me to embrace the Portuguese community and culture and the 
Latino community and culture. I think it just helps me understand— because the industry is full of 
different cultures. I feel it helps me to understand their way of thinking, their beliefs, their fears, 
whether they be culturally-based or factual. 
MHA: So... what brought your mom here? 
[5:00] DK: You know thaf s a great question. I know that when my grandmother, her brother, 
lived here. So when I was growing up it was my grandmother, and then she had a brother that 
lived here, and then we had several cousins so we all— it was weird, it was like— all— I felt back 
then, this is in the 70s, that all the Puerto Ricans, we all lived in the south end of New Bedford. 
So my grandparents lived there and next door were Puerto Rican families, then the next door 
would be my uncle, you know, her brother. I'm really not sure exactly what brought them to New 
Bedford. 
MHA: If s interesting though I didn't realize there was a whole— 
DK: Oh yes, there was— I mean I just— it was all— I can remember at Christmas time, you 
know, them coming— they would could come from house to house and they would be singing in 
Spanish with their little maracas and these, you know and I totally felt that I lived in like, little 
Puerto Rico. Even though I was bom here, I felt, I was surrounded by Puerto Rican communities, 
we went to Spanish churches. Big time. 
MHA: How about in school? Were there groups of? 
DK: No in school I felt— that was— so I went to a Catholic school. I didn't go to public school so 
maybe thaf s why— I went to Catholic school, so I felt that I was in the minority back then. 
Definitely, I felt I was in the minority by having a Puerto Rican mom. 
MHA: Did you have any— did you feel any prejudice? 
Interview with Debra Kelsey, January 5, 2017

DK: I never did. I personally didn't. I'm very sensitive though to how people stereotype others, 
I'm very sensitive to that. I don’t— I'm not the type of person who would categorize an industry 
or a culture or a race or a sex by the doings of one person. If that makes any sense to you. 
MHA: And how about the neighborhood that you grew up in? Were any of them in the industry? 
Probably not if— 
DK: No. I'm honestly trying to remember any... any fishermen that I encountered back in the day 
and I can honestly say, no. The families that I knew they worked at like the mills, you know, 
that's what they did. 
MHA: And how about in Catholic school? Were any of the kids children of . . 
DK: I also don't recall ever meeting. I never— you would think in the city of New— and I'm not 
sure if, you know we're going back a long time. I'm not sure if it was because it was a Catholic 
school versus— I don't know if the public schools here in New Bedford ever taught about our 
fishing industry. I don't know. I just know that— no, you know I remember those dads being like 
business men but coming to pick up their daughters in their shirts and their ties. No, it was only 
into my adult life that... 
MHA: What was your first introduction to...? 
[8:43] DK: So it was actually— I met this— I met a man who was a fisherman. So when I met him 
he was actually working on land; he had not fished for a couple of years. So I met him working 
on land and he had said that he had been a fisherman, but he was trying something new now, so 
we had a relationship and... even though he was no longer a fisherman, his life was surrounded 
with fishing families. His father is a fisherman, his uncle's a fisherman, his brother is a 
fisherman— his son's a fisherman, his friends. So I got to know fishing families and in all honesty 
my impression of fishermen once I was older, was the stereotype, which I'm so against and can't 
believe that I— I had a stereotype of fisherman. And so I felt that that wasn't the type of lifestyle 
for me, so it was never something that I was interested in or pursued. I was ignorant and I just 
didn't know. So then in meeting this man, and now again he goes back to being a fisherman and 
so I'm thrust into that world and I came to meet families that are just like me. I met these men 
who go out and work hard, who feed the world, who sacrifice their time, their safety... I realized 
that not every fisherman is that stereotypical drunk, drug addict, whatever you may think it is. 
And then it was like my— it was very important for me to share that information with the rest of 
the community, because I wanted people to know who these families really are; that they're 
people just like you and me and just like there are bad apples in any industry or community... 
fishermen, they weren't who I thought they were. They were so much more and they did so much 
more for our community and for our city and I grew a great appreciation for them and their 
families and grateful for what they have done for our city where I can live and work and where 
I've raised my son. That is a great deal, I believe, because of the industry. It employs so many. It

brings so much to our city. If we didn't have this industry I don't know what we'd be. I hate to 
even think of that. I really do. 
MHA: So how did you get involved with the Partnership? 
DK: So, I was a wife who was very involved in my husband's life, so when he went to get gear 
work, I was with him and when he grubbed up, I was grubbing when he left, I was there to pick 
him up. So I met a shore side business owner, Kirstin and I remember we had gone into her shop 
and he was working on some nets and I walked in and she said, “you looking for a full time job 
because Fishing Partnership is looking for a fisherman's wife to be an advocate” and she said, “I 
thought of you immediately.” So that to me, that was like a dream come true for me, because I 
wanted to help my husband and I wanted to help my family. I wanted to help other fishing 
families and it was also a way of me being able to show our community what the industry is and 
what the industry does. So it was like a... wow... I was like, “absolutely” and she called the vice 
president of Fishing Partnership up while I was there and we spoke over the phone and I sent him 
my resume that night and a couple weeks later, five years ago, here I am. 
MHA: So what do you do on a day-to-day basis? 
DK: I do— I have a variety of fun things that I get to do. We're Navigators for the 
Commonwealth of Mass, so that I get to assist fishing families, as well as anybody in our 
community, to enroll into healthcare. Thaf s not an easy task. They call us Navigators because we 
have been trained through the Commonwealth how to navigate through that system so we can 
assist families with applying for health insurance, understanding how to enroll, selecting a plan, 
going through the plans, making payments, this is just a little way to assist our fishing families. 
These guys are out for 10 days, 14 days, in for one or two, they don’t have time to sit down and 
spend hours going through the marketplace, so this is a benefit. Come on in here. I'll do it with 
you, hopefully we'll get it done in an hour, you can go back to spending time with your family, 
your kids, you know the things you need to do. That's one way, we promote the health and 
wellbeing of fishing families and we do that by, again, the health insurance assistance. We offer 
free safety at sea trainings for commercial fishermen, drill conducting courses, CPR courses. We 
do— we have these discounted dental cleanings where they can come into the office, we have a 
dental hygienist set up, they get their teeth cleaned, oral health check. It's $25, you can bring 
your family. If you have Mass Health, if s free, if you don't, if any other coverage or if you don't, 
if s a $25 fee and your whole family can come in and get their teeth cleaned. We offer financial 
workshops. I have one coming up next month. This is going to be about successful credit and 
debt management; just teaching you how to look at your credit score, ways to help increase your 
credit score, different ideas on when applying for student loans, when looking to buy a car, just 
little things to help our families save money, just some helpful tips. We're also now doing opioid 
awareness. These courses have been amazing. Our community is in the middle of this epidemic; 
it not only affects our fishing industry, it affects our community, so we're doing these opioid 
awareness trainings. We're showing fishing families how to administer Narcan, have a plan of 
action if an emergency were to happen and not only is this for, as I said, our industry, we tell

these families this could be your neighbor's son. It could be the little old lady next door to you 
who forgot she took her meds and took it again. The life you save could be anywhere, grocery 
store, the gas station, the pharmacy, the waterfront, the car. So, that's— on a daily basis I'm 
dabbling in any of those, all of those offerings, always trying to figure out what more we could 
do for our families, always grateful to hear from fishermen's wives or mothers or daughters or 
other people that are in the— shore side support. What are the needs? What can we bring to you 
that could help? In the past we've heard free flu shots, free tetanus shots, so we do that as well. 
We partner with Southcoast Health. We bring flu shots, pneumonia, tetanus; we'll check your 
cholesterol, glucose, blood pressure. We partner with them to do oral cancer screenings. I feel 
like a lot of fishermen smoke and this is important to have these screenings available, they're 
free, so we just try to keep them healthy and safe not only physically, but mentally and 
emotionally as well. We have this Riverside Trauma Center that we have partnered with. They 
have offerings so if there was an overdose, we have a psychological first aid team that could 
come out specifically to speak to you and to yours — in November we had some fishermen. New 
Bedford fishermen who went out on their pleasure boat and they're lost at sea and they've not 
returned so we have services where we actually assisted those families with this psychological 
first aid. I feel that... this service is going to be something that is really going to be needed as we 
move forward with the way this epidemic is. And with all these safety hazards and regulations 
that they face, I really think this service is going to be something that's going to be really utilized 
as time goes on. 
MHA: So do you serve mainly as sort of a gatherer of these different services? 
DK: I like to think that we're like— we try to be the human resource department for our fishing 
families. And that's what I want. I mean I may not have everything right here on my desk but if 
you need something and you call me and you ask me. I'm going to do everything that I can to 
find out what you can do or who you can go to so that's what I like for our families to know, that 
I'm here for anything. You have— you want to talk about opioid use and abuse. I'll do that with 
you. I'm not a professional but I can start that conversation with you and see where it goes. You 
want to talk about alcoholism, you want to talk about financial planning, I got that for you too. 
You need your teeth cleaned, I can help you with that. You need CPR, wait a minute? 
[Laughing] We've got that too. You know, I just want them to know that we're here. We're here. 
They're not alone. There are people here on land, we got your back. 
[20:53] MHA: How many people know about you and come in and utilize your services? Can 
you estimate? 
DK: Jeez. I mean, I wish I had some numbers in front of me. 
MHA: It doesn't really matter, just— I guess what I'm really asking is, do most people know, the 
crew members... are they the ones that come mostly? 
Interview with Debra Kelsey, January 5, 2017

DK: It's a variety that come. I feel that a lot of people in the industry, they do know about us 
because of our safety trainings. I don't think— I think they know about Fishing Partnership, they 
see the hats, they see the logo— they might know Fishing Partnership. Oh they're the health 
insurance people. Oh they're the safety people. Oh thaf s the girl with the van. I don't think that 
they know all the services that we have to offer. I think that if you— if I got down to the 
waterfront, they either see me as safety— you know this group of guys might see me as a safety 
girl, and this group of guys they see me as the—oh, that's the health insurance girl, where the 
other guys will be like oh, that's the shot lady, she always wants you to come and get shots. 
BOTH: [laughing] 
DK: So I think that there are a lot of fishermen that don't know about us. But I think that there 
are more fishermen today then there were 5 years ago that know about Fishing Partnership and 
that have utilized the services that we've been able to offer. I definitely believe that. And I think 
that the more we do these events, the workshops, the CPR, the word spreads. 
MHA: And you— it sounds like you do go down to the waterfront. 
DK: I love to go to the waterfront. That's my favorite place to be. You have to go to where they 
are, I do— I find— I make out— I will see way more fishermen, obviously, if I got to the 
waterfront then if I were just to sit here all day. I mean lots of guys— this is a heavily— you know 
there's the sector manager downstairs and then we have Joan doing the settlements. So there's a 
lot of fishermen that come in here, but for me the waterfront— on my way to work, I drive down 
all three just to see what boats are in, what boats are out. Just so they keep seeing me. I feel like 
the more I go down there, the more comfortable they are with talking to me. They're actually 
happy to see me now. I can see the smiles from all the way down there when they— you know. 
So yeah, I go— I attend industry meetings. I volunteer with other fishing organizations to do 
Veterans Day, to take out inner-city kids, I mean, you got to go where they are and you have to 
be part of their life. And I am. And I’m happy to do that. I go to MLA meetings. I go to Boston 
Harbor meetings. I, whatever, that's how I let them know who we are and what we have to offer 
and if I didn't go to those things, it would just be pointless. 
MHA: So most of— probably most people know about you through word-of-mouth? 
[24:43] Yes. Definitely, through word-of-mouth. And like I notice with the health insurance for 
example. Like four years ago— I mean, I still see the people, I see some of the same people 
coming for insurance today, as I did four years ago. Those were like captains, boat owners, shore 
side— I see more now... crew. Oh, my captain told me you helped him out, he told me to come 
here, come see you. Or I'll have a captain come in, “hey, I brought these two, they need help”— 
if s just— so yes, word-of-mouth. Definitely. Word-of-mouth. 
MHA: So do you see any change in your— in— well if s only been 5 years but have you seen 
change at all in say, the age? The average age of the fishermen? 
Interview with Debra Kelsey, January 5, 2017 
9 
DK: It's so funny because I— you know it all depends on the fishery, when you think about it. I 
see these young lobstermen. I see these young scallopers. So when people ask me, oh— or say 
fishermen are aging out, aging out, I don't know— in some, yes, but in others I see younger— 
especially in the lobster and the scalloping industry there's younger fishermen. It is only been a 
short time. If anything I've noticed I'm— in the last 5 years I've assisted more younger fishermen, 
then I knew there were. Especially when I'm assisting with Maine fishermen. Those are all 16- 
year old young boys, that's amazing to me. I love to see that. I think that... I think part of the 
reason why there aren't so many younger fishermen maybe in the fisheries that we are most 
familiar with is... all the regulations and all— it just— I hear guys saying to their kids, “no, you 
don't want to be a fisherman.” I'm like Wahhh! Thaf s hurts my heart. But, if s like, if s not worth 
it. They should go to school or get another job because it's not going to be here anymore or, it's 
just not worth it. They're not talking about the danger. If s the going out and being limited and so, 
I don't know. I feel that I see— I've seen a lot more younger fishermen then I thought there were. 
Maybe that's because I've gotten more involved with... in other fisheries. 
MHA: Now when you first became involved with the industry as a wife; did you find that hard to 
adjust to? 
DK: Oh my gosh. So like these— these financial workshops that we hold now are in part was 
something that— so I worked on land and I was used to getting paid to either every week or every 
other week. My household, I knew how to budget based on every week or every other week and 
now I get married and now I don't know when my husband's getting paid and I don't know how 
much my husband's getting paid and I don't know if this month if s going to be $400 or if if s 
going to be $4,000. That was very stressful for me. I was always worried. I never wanted to 
spend any money because I didn't know— I knew what was going out, I just didn't know what 
was coming in. And that was very stressful and I didn't know how to budget and I didn't know 
who to turn to. And then I felt a little embarrassed to try to talk to other people about such 
private things. So it was a big adjustment. I was used to my partner being home at night, taking 
out the trash, being an equal partner, not all of a sudden for 14 days I'm running this house. I'm 
the queen of the castle, I have all the responsibilities. And then, all of a sudden you've got to step 
aside because now your man's home and he wants to be the king of the castle and he wants to run 
the house. So it was very challenging. And I wished back then that I had a group of wives... that I 
could ask these questions to or just say, hey, I feel like this sometimes, like I can't wait for him to 
go, like is that bad? So thaf s what I like— a part of what I do here is that we do have these 
financial workshops and we do have these opportunities where we can gather and talk freely and 
comfortably and you're with your own. So yeah, that was quite the challenge. It was scary. I just 
never felt... comfortable because I never knew when he came in. What if the price of fish went 
down? What if, whatever. You never knew, nothing was like— nothing was for sure, where at 
least with an on land job, you know that in two weeks you're going to get so much and you can 
plan on that. In this crazy world of fishing, you can't count or plan on anything. You're going to 
be in for Christmas? I don't know. You want to schedule a doctor's appointment 6 months from 
now; how the heck do you know if— like that was part of the problem with my own husband. 
Interview with Debra Kelsey, January 5, 2017

Part of the reason why we did partner with the van. Like for a simple flu shot or a tetanus shot. 
They don't have time for that. So it was like well, maybe if we can bring it to them at least they'll 
get their flu shot, at least they'll get their tetanus shot, at least they can get their blood pressure 
checked. Oh, if your sugar's high, at least it gave them— it was something, more than nothing, 
which thaf s all they had time for. Nothing. 
[32:05] MHA: I'm curious too about the health— the mental health aspect, I know that a lot of 
people are under pressure from the regulations and the changes. 
DK: Absolutely, that's part of the reason why—I think thaf s part of why Fishing Partnership has 
partnered with this Riverside Trauma Center to help... to help talk about these issues. To help... 
realize that whatever feelings you're feeling are valid and that everybody can deal with things 
differently and that mental health is part of your whole health and we— you know we've been 
focusing all on the physical stuff, but we're hearing more and more— we know— knowing more— 
there's the mental part is needed as well to keep you all in balance. So I mean, I think that it is a 
challenge to get people to talk about mental health. But it was also a challenge to talk about 
opioid awareness and alcohol abuse. But the more you talk about it the more people are— they've 
been open about it... 
MHA: How about abusive family relations. Are those showing up at all? 
DK: So if they are... if they are. I've not had that conversation or any... well... thaf s not true, 
there is one family in particular where I— the husband actually said something to me about his 
wife, when she drinks, hits him. And it was— we were actually— I was volunteering for another 
fishing— and we were doing a Veteran’s Day for the vets and there was like 20 lobster boats and 
we were all just talking and I— you know I met his wife because it was like my third year doing 
it so I was like how is your wife? And he was like, ugh, things are not good. Things are not good, 
I don't know if it's going to work out and I'm like. I'm so sorry and he's like, well if s not 
cheating, if s not cheating and I'm like, oh, okay and he's like, but when she drinks she just like to 
[claps]. Oh my god. So I just— you know, I listened and all I could say to him was that if at any 
time he wanted to talk about it that I could— I'd be happy to talk to him about it, but that I was 
not a professional, so that if he was looking for somebody that could really help him out I could 
connect him with that person and if s thank you but if s not— it hasn't come to happen. But at least 
we had that conversation. 
[35:26] MHA: Right. 
DK: And he brought it up. You know? But it was weird because— but it was outside of work. We 
were doing a volunteering thing and now this is the third year in a row that I had done it with 
them and... 
MHA: Huh. 
Interview with Debra Kelsey, January 5, 2017 
11 
DK: You know, and I had... a person approach me who thought they had maybe an alcohol 
problem and I said I can set something up with such and such, all you have to do is call me and 
within three days, I just gave him all the info and I haven't heard from him and if I do I will 
follow through, and if I don't at least he knows that if and when he's ready, there's somebody 
here who's like yeah, we've got you. We've got you over here, so. 
MHA: I know that was one of the few years when we were doing social impact assessments 
when they started putting in the new ground fish regulations and so on, that there would be more 
mental health issues, alcoholism and domestic abuse, that kind of thing, so. 
DK: Absolutely... I mean, definitely. You know if s just I guess if s trying to take away the stigma 
that... mental health means you're mental, you know? But I think that it can be done, you just 
have to do it delicately and you have to be sincere when you talk to these families about wanting 
to help, because they know a bull-shitter. You can't bullshit a bull-shitter. 
MHA: [laughing] So when you first got started was there any push back from women since you 
were—? 
DK: A girl, since I'm a girl. You know, I... I honestly don't feel that there ever has been. And I'm 
very— I'm very sensitive that I am a woman working in a man's world and I am very sensitive to 
spouses and I always try to present myself in a professional manner, caring, but a professional 
manner because I want— I never want a wife to feel like threatened or uncomfortable. I want her 
to be able to come to me with an issue and I want her to feel comfortable that I'm calling her 
husband to ask him to come to CPR. So I honestly... I haven't felt that way. I really haven't. 
MHA: How about other women on the waterfront? Do you see anybody in what were 
traditionally male— men's jobs and... do you see any push back for them? 
DK: No way, I think the women— I think the industry is led by women when— you know, look at 
Joan Fenner, look at Anne, we've got Edie and Marie over here. We have Virginia. No and I 
think... nope. I don't know, I... I don't really know if when these guys look at us, if they see man 
or woman, or if they just see this is a person who's true and wants to help. Thaf s how I'd like to 
think that when people look at me. They don't see five feet, you little,... you know, they just see 
this good person who wants to give back for all that I've been given. That I just—thaf s how— 
when I look at a person, I don't see age, I don't see gender. I've never been like that. That's why if 
somebody asks me how old do you think I am, I have no idea. Because quite frankly I just see 
the person— a person. And either you're good to me or you're not. You know? Simple. 
[40:02] MHA: So what do you think is the hardest part of your job? 
DK: Oh, the hardest part about my job would be disconnecting my feelings. Thafs the hardest 
part. I get— when somebody's hurting whether it be whatever, they have a toothache or their 
husband is lost at sea... or they're having trouble with health insurance, I worry and I think about

it and I carry it with me. I definitely— I try to, I want to make everybody feel like so good, so 
sometimes I just take on too much and I hold it in my heart. That's I think the— that's the hardest 
part for me is like, letting go. You know, I assisted this fisherman's wife two years ago with 
health insurance. There was a particular medication that she needed to take. So we check that 
medication is on the formulary, which means it's covered. So she enrolls in that plan, she gets 
going, then she calls me and—well, she couldn't get that medication, even though it was on the 
formulary, the reason she couldn't get it was because her numbers weren't high enough. I mean it 
was just so stupid, but do you know that... that totally freaked me out for a long time. I was like 
what more could I have done to make sure— and there was nothing more that I could have done. 
There was nothing more that I could have done, it was up to— it's up to the doctors and 
pharmaceutical companies, whatever percentage you have to be at, in order to be able to receive 
this particular medication. But stuff like that, that stays with me. She wasn't upset, it was nothing 
that I did, but I felt like... did I not do due diligence? Could I have done more? I worried because 
now she can't have her medicine. It was weird. That sort of stuff that— you know these ladies 
that, you know, their husbands are lost. I thought about them all Christmas and New Year’s, just 
thinking about what are they doing, what are they feeling, what about their kids. Just... that's the 
stuff that... but that's good stuff too, I guess. 
MHA: Well what's your favorite part about the job? 
DK: I don't know, I have a lot of favorite parts of my job. I guess... I love the safety trainings. I 
do, I love safety trainings, I feel that that makes a big difference and that it's, we're making it— 
we're helping to keep bringing these guys home to their wives and to their kids which is all— 
what— I always wanted my husband to come home, so I mean that's one of my favorite parts. 
Safety training and watching these guys go through safety trainings and see them shooting off 
the flares, putting out fires and getting their survival suit on and then hearing them say, “wow 
that was excellent,” or “I didn't know about this” or, “oh, my survival suit had a leak.” I feel that 
the safety trainings, after every safety training, I know that we have touched, we've made a 
difference in at least one person's life if not many. So that's one of my favorite parts of the job is 
my safety trainings, I love that. 
MHA: Have you ever gotten into a survival suit—? 
DK: Oh yes. Oh yes. Because I— a couple years ago we were at the Mass Lobstermen's 
Association Weekend and we were doing a pool module there and there were two fishermen and 
there was an older one and I was— I said to him. I'll do it if you do it, so the next morning I got in 
my survival suit—actually, Lauren did it that day too and we went in with the other two 
fishermen and we did the— we did all the maneuvers and the worst part was— by the time we did 
all the maneuvers I was great, so now I was the second one to get into the life raft and I got up to 
my waist and I couldn't kick anymore. I had no energy I was like, please pull me in. 
BOTH: [laughing] 
Interview with Debra Kelsey, January 5, 2017 
13 
[45:05] DK: All those maneuvers were exhausting because I can't— I need to put my money 
where my mouth is. So then— now I say, when I hear a guy ugh, I'm claustrophobic. I'm like, if I 
can do it, you can do it. Or I'll be like, “I'll do it with you if you want.” Like with my CPR Class 
coming up next week. I'm like, “come take CPR with me” because I will be right down there on 
the floor doing it with them. I'll take one for the team, I don't care, I take CPR every year 
because— and they all love it. They all love it that I'm doing CPR with them. Or that I'm going in 
the pool. They're like wow, alright, she's not all just talk, she will... so get in there— get in the 
trenches, get on the boats and— I'm not afraid. I'll go fishing with you [laughing]. 
MHA: Have you ever gone out? 
DK: I've been out lobstering, just on day boats I've not gone out... lobstering is pretty cool. I 
would like to go. I'd like to see clamming and I'd like to see how long-lining is done. I'd love to 
see how clamming is done. 
MHA: How many clam boats are there? 
DK: There's a few of them here, three, maybe four. Yep. I'd like to see that. But lobstering yeah 
I've done that. Thaf s all cool. I don't know if I could leave my family like these guys do. It's 
tough. 
MHA: So you have a son, do you have other? 
DK: No, just my son. He's 26. He could never be a fisherman. 
MHA: [laughing] 
DK: He did, he used to come and clean out the hold— do the boards but, yeah. It takes a special 
kind of person to do that. 
MHA: Can you elaborate on that? 
DK: Alright, well first of all I think you have to be like one with the universe. Think about it. 
Their lives is by the ebb and the flow if s just amazing— I think you need to be— you like to be 
your own boss. You're very independent. You need to be a hard worker. You need to know how 
to sacrifice: sleep, food, family, deprive yourself of all the luxuries. Yeah, you have to be pretty 
special to be able to give up all the... to me they're luxuries that we have. You know where you're 
laying your bed every night. You know you're going to look over and your wife is there. You 
know you're going to get up you're going to have eggs and toast, your kids are going to go to 
school. That's not how they live. They may get up thinking they're going fishing and they get up 
and the tide's this or the wind's that and now if s, okay, switch gears. And I guess maybe you 
have to be... selfless, because I'm too selfish. I don't want to be away from home. I don't want to 
be missing my family. I don't want to be afraid out there. 
Interview with Debra Kelsey, January 5, 2017 
14 
MHA: Do people talk about that at all? Do they talk about the fear? 
[48:50] DK: Sure they talk about when something has happened like... the Pilgrim. I don't know 
if you've heard of the Pilgrim. They're a long-liner. Anyway he's— the captain was in here and he 
was like I had to jog for 23 hours before another vessel could— his mast broke, so the Coast 
Guard, they had called the Coast Guard and ever34hing but— so yeah, he sat here and he was just 
like talking about the 23 hours of jogging and then wondering, because the mast was in the water 
and he was like, that's why I'm all about safety, and I know— since I've known him, he's been 
through at least three safety trainings. Yeah, because I'll ask him, how was it out there? What 
was the weather like? Yeah, they... they get scared. I think a lot of them don't want to talk about 
it. Don't like to think about it. And then some might think you're jinxing it, if you talk about it. 
And then others are just— because like I said to them, you need to come in March so you can tell 
your story and he's like, I have no problem doing that. It all depends on the person. But like, 
yeah. This particular guy, he had— he's like, “I was scared, we all had our survival suits on.” 
Yep. “Made the Mayday call.” 
MHA: So did the Coast Guard get him, or? 
DK: No, actually the sister ship went out and got them. So if s Linda McCann downstairs. It was 
her husband's two boats. So that was her step-son who was one captain, the captain that was out 
there and then, I guess, her husband. And he said— oh he said he was calling the Coast Guard and 
either the Coast Guard couldn't hear him, so thaf s when he said he called Linda for her to call the 
Coast Guard. So thaf s weird too. And thaf s actually. So yeah, they do, or and if s— especially at 
safety trainings, you know, they'll be like has anybody been on a boat that had a fire? You know, 
somebody will raise his hand and he'll talk about it and then that encourages, oh well, “I had one 
too,” so I think safety trainings is awesome because it is like a gathering. I remember when we 
first started, the instructors were like, well we should try to keep lobster men with lobster men 
you know because its different fisheries, and I was like no. 
MHA: [chuckling] 
DK: No, I was never for that. Let them all be together. Let them all get to meet each other. Oh, 
this is what I do, oh well, this is what I do. So I think if s great, because we don't segregate or— 
if s all, you get to learn what a dragger does, what a long-liner does. 
MHA: Thaf s good. So... how many people work here? 
DK: In the New Bedford office? 
MHA: Mhm. 
Interview with Debra Kelsey, January 5, 2017 
15 
DK: So it's Monica and myself and then Verna is coming back two days a week, I guess, starting 
next week. So there's yeah. 
MHA: And how many altogether? 
DK: There's Nina and Angela in Gloucester, and then there's Morgan and Shannon in Chatham 
and Laurie is in Plymouth and Monica and myself, and then Verna. So eight of us. 
MHA: And I know sometimes you end up going up to Maine? So it is one of? 
DK: So what it is, is thaf s the Maine Lobstermen's association and somehow, I don't know how, 
but there's some grant money that pays for... the Navigator in Maine. I can't think of her name 
now. So yeah but I think thaf s grant money that pays for her to be a Navigator in Maine. So she 
doesn't do— they don't do all— the only thing they do that we do is the health insurance. There's 
no— I mean there's safety trainings that we bring up there, those are grants too. I don't think they 
come from Maine Lobstermen's Association. 
MHA: So does the Partnership still rely on grant money mainly to keep going? So JJ is in charge 
of getting the grant? 
DK: Yeah, that's all their stuff Yeah I don't know anything about that. 
MHA: [laughing] 
DK: Lm so glad that's not on me. But yeah. I think there might be some... private donations but I 
think that from what I know it's mostly grants. Federal and state. 
MHA: So do you ever have anxiety about whether they'll be able to keep getting grants or? 
DK: Well you know what, I figure... I don't worry, I just figure Fishing Partnership has been 
around since 1997 so if they could go— if they could withstand these 20 years— because I feel we 
bring so much to the industry, if s not like we're just health insurance, if s not like we're just 
safety. So no, I don't worry because what's worrying going to do? All I worry about is— doing 
what I can to do, right now while I'm here, to do what I can. Tomorrow is another day. We'll see- 
- we'll get to that when it comes. 
[55:12] MHA: Thaf s great. So I think I asked you all the questions that I planned to ask you. Is 
there anything that I haven't asked you that I should have? 
DK: I don't think so. 
Interview with Debra Kelsey, January 5, 2017 
16 
MHA: Or how about anything that you would like to make sure that when we start designing our 
next couple of exhibits that we... say about either the Partnership or just in general, the services 
you provide. 
DK: You know, I just want people to know that the Partnership is here and that we are from the 
community, we are fishing families so... we get it. I understand your struggle, I understand your 
way of life, I understand your challenges. This is a no judgment zone and I'm just— we're here to 
help in any way we can. That’s it. Plain and simple. I love you man! 
BOTH: [laughing] 
MHA: And who would have thought when you— 
DK: No kidding! 
MHA: —were in high school? 
DK: Never. I worked in printing for 20 years. Printing was my— I worked in commercial printing 
that was what I did. I knew that like the back of my hand. I made a decent living, I was able to 
raise my son on that pay and then, I got laid off There was years of layoffs and I was— I kept 
seeing three years of layoffs, all of a sudden I was like, “oh my God, my time is coming soon” 
you know? And it did. I decided well, since printing is no more, I thought I was going to go into 
the medical field. I went to the Salter School full time for 10 months, I became a medical 
assistant, I graduated with a 4.0 GPA, and then I started doing it, and I don't like to touch people. 
MHA: [laughing] 
DK: So I was like, oh, I do not like to touch people and I don't like people touching me. Oh my 
God. So then it was like, “now what?” Now what? And then like I said, it was like a miracle- 
walked into Reidar's and Kirsten was like, you looking for a full-time job? She's like, they're 
looking for a fisherman's wife to be an advocate and I thought of you immediately and I was like 
yes, I am! 
MHA: [laughing] 
DK: And I thought, wow, what a dream come true. How awesome to be helping an industry, to 
be helping my own. It's the best. The best. 
MAH: Thaf s true. Well, Debby, I really appreciate the time. 
DK: Awesome, no, this was my pleasure I hope— I know I'm all over the place because my brain 
goes like ch-ch-ch-ch.
