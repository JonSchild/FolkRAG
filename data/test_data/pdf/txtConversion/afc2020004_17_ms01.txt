Peacemaking  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
We long ago made a peace   
—a treaty— 
between enemy neighbors  
like this  
striped blankets 
 sashes worked with colored beads 
animal-shaped pipes  
of red stone 
 iron hatchets inlaid with lead designs   flutes carved to look  
like a duck or goose 
belts woven with colored threads 
brass bells 
copper water vessels 
red wool 
rich gifts to seal the peace 
 
Sometimes the deal did not go down  
 
Some wanted more 
to be upheld as great men 
(yes—only men)  
 
We take your names with us to speak in honor of your greatness always  
and when we ever hear your name, we will say “That is a great man you speak of”  
and we will tell the stories of all the deeds you’ve done and how fine a figure you  
made, how arrayed in fine clothes, and how many horses and how large your voice… 
 
You get the idea 
 
Except we had to mean it  
 
 
irreversibly  
Even though those men might have stolen 
broken families  
murdered 
 
or maybe it was their thieving sons we killed even then we had to forget  
and mean what we said 
 
Imagine how hard it would be to humble ourselves to humanity  
Tell their stories as if they were our brothers-fathers-kin folk—with pride  
As if just making peace with them made them relatives whose shine  
shined on us 
 
We seek your peace now  
for futures we cannot gift amends 
unless like this 
sleep—under blankets  beads of bright creatures pollinating flowers  animals  
red stone 
 iron 
 flute song 
duck and goose 
 earth full of microbes  
and minerals  sun stored to serve you 
wind making light and nights cool enough 
 
water and vessels to drink  
   —all once a given then a gift  
future riches  
 
You get the idea 
 
We came in peace but left the aftermath of war like mud tracked in  
messed up your carpets and ate all your bread 
left milk jugs empty in the fridge and worse 
 
 much worse  
 
Let our peace be one you can reverse  
No gift can be enough—if we left you and  
even gone 
we keep stealing your summers 
 leaving just the storms 
if we left you winters brutal beyond history 
 birds gone and bugs in tornadoes 
all the fish gutted  
 
 
 
 
 
water run off 
 
It would be OK then to reverse the peace we made when you were born  
You do not need to hold up our names  
 
irreversibly  
only do not curse as you say them or 
please  
leave us off as relatives— 
make us ancestors only  
as worthy as names on paper signs 
 
 
Uphold the great ones 
 
and if we can’t be them  
  
 
don’t speak our names at all
