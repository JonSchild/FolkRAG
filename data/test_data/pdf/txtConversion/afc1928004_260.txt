TO THE PUBLIC! 
In launching cur little book out on the Ocean of Popu-
lar favor, we deem it necessary to say a 
few words in its 
behalf, as well as our own. 
It is our aim to have new and 
Original Music, Songs, etc., to keep up with the times ; 
and we think we have succeeded in getting together a 
col-
lection of new and popular Songs, mostly written by our-
selves and sung by us with great success, at the popular 
resort of amusement lovers, the Olympic Theatre, 621 
Broadway, New York, where we are at present engaged, 
hoping that this, our second edition, will meet with favor 
at your hands and prove a 
success both financially and 
critically ; and if in perusing its contents it serves to while 
away an hour, and perchance may cause a 
smile, we will 
be satisfied, and feel that we are doing something for the 
good of our fellow- men. 
So, Dear Public, accept our 
thanks for your past many marks of favor showered upon 
us—We Remain— 
Yours, Truly, 
HARPER k STANSILL .

I'VE sang to you quite oft' before, 
Of charming girls divine; 
But now I've found a 
clearer one. 
She is a 
bean of mine. 
Her eyes are bright as evening stars, 
As soft as heavens bin ; 
Each day I 
bless the hour I 
met 
My charming, little Lou. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, yes, I 
love her dear as life, 
And to me she is true, 
Fm only waiting for the day 
I 
shall wed my little Lou. 
We met one summer's evening 
When the sun was sinking low, 
In Central Park, down by the fount, 
Where sparkling waters flow. 
She smiled so sweet, and then she blushed 
As I 
was passing by; 
Mect me to- morrow evening here, 
A 
smile was my reply. 
Oh, yes, I 
love her, Sze.

YOU may talk about your dashing blondes, 
And lovely brunettes gay; 
But there's none so fair that can compare 
With my Belle of Pleasure Bay. 
She's only seventeen years old, and has such modest crrace, 
'Twould do you good, indeed it would, to see her smiling face, 
And hear her little prattling tongue, 
Would steal your heart away. 
Her feet are small, and she's not tall,

Who think that her they'll win; 
They praise her hair but she don't care, 
She's not to be taken in 
She treats them all with kind ic : pect but says she must refuse, 
For gold nor land can win her hand, from the lover she did

So soon we'll married be, aivi then

SHINE YOUR BOOTS? 
Written by Tom H ARPER. 
Sung by the LA 
VERDE'S. 
Dedicated to the Boot-blacks of New York. 
I'm a 
boot-black, here, in this City, 
And I've come to sing a 
ditty, 
Hoping it will excite your pity 
For the boot-blacks throughout our glorious land; 
You'll find that they are honest blades, Sir, 
And of hard work not afraid, Sir, 
Although they're in the boot- black trade, Sir ; 
So give to them a 
helping hand. 
Cnonus. 
Shine I 
shine 
shine your boots, 
In a 
style that surely snits ; 
If you'll only shine your boots with ma, 
You'll find that I'm an honest blade, 
And of hard work not afraid, 
Although I'm in the boot black trade— 
As yOil can plainly site, Sir. 
We know we often look seedy, 
But it's only when we are needy ; 
And with each other we are never greedy, 
But always try to do the best we can. 
How many men in our mighty Nation, 
Who are holding, now, a 
higher station, 
Have risen from an humbler occupation 
Than blacking boots, throughout the laud. 
Shine ! Shine ! &c. 
Now, boys, there comes a 
peeler, 
I 
know him well, for he's a 
squealer ! 
He'd tell the Judge, up town, that you're a 
stealer, 
So I 
must hurry and finish up my song. 
He tc2Is Inc to move off his beat, Sir, 
And he kicks me out into the street, Sir ; 
Why can't he m3 with kindness treat, Sir, 
For, surely, I 
do nothing wrong. 
Shine ! Shine!

And I

I

My pet, in the dollar store ! 
Next Sunday is the happy day, 
She says we're to be wed. 
I

I'm really out of my head ; 
For when you love a

You'll ash for nothing more; 
So hurry up! get on the mash, 
There's plenty in the store.

WHO'LL BUY MY PAPERS? 
Written and composed by Tom HARPER, ESQ., and sung 
with great success, by the LA 
VEP.DES. 
Dedicated to the Newsboys of New York. 
Oh! listen, kind stranger, and gentlemen too ! 
I've come here to sell my papets to you ; 
All day, through the City, foot sore I 
do roam, 
I'm a 
poor little newsboy, and I 
have no home; 
Poor Father is dead; and Mother's gone too! 
What, in this world, can a 
little boy do ? 
Shoeless—supperless—miserable, am I— 
I 
can't sell my papers, for no one will buy. 
Cnonus. 
Come buy ? conic buy a 
paper, Sir, You ? 
Here's a 
Herald, or Sun—buy one, Sir, do? 
And a 
poor boy's blessing, then, will be yours ! 
And you'll keep starvation away from my door. 
To-night, in the snow, I 
could lay me down 
And die there, for nothing I 
meet with but frowns ; 
Forced to go hungry, day after day, 
Oh! Heaven, have pity on me I 
pray ! 
And give to us all a 
plenty to-night ; 
And keep my heart pure, that I 
may do right; 
Freezing— starving—miserable, am I, 
For I 
can't sell my papers, for no one will buy. 
Come buy, S:o.

Old man, what is the matter, what makes you look so blue? 
Is it anything that this little girl has said or done to you'? 
If so, I 
feel so sorry, to make you look so sad, 
And if you have come home again, I'm sure you should 
be glad. 
HE. 
Oh no, my child, it's nothing you've said or clone to me, 
But I'm all alone in this world, without friend or family ; 
And now I've nothing left me but for to pine and sigh, 
And hunt me out a 
resting place to lay me down and die. 
I'm sure you oughtn't to feel so, for I'm an orphan too, 
My father's gone for a 
soldier and donn'd the army blue ! 
I 
suppose that he is dead, for we've never receiv'd a 
line, 
And I 
know that he is in his grave way down in Caroline. 
HE. 
It's now about ten years ago I 
left old Aunty Sue; 
I 
ran away for a 
soldier, put on the army blue ; 
I 
left here my dear old wife, and Susan was her name, 
And now I 
find that she is dead, I 
wish that I 
were the 
same.

Respectfully dedicated to the Veterans of the ( 9th New York 
Regiment Volunteef, 
Oh! I've latdy come from America, the land of the brave

And an Irishman, tacre, is as good as an:: one, 
Althou,gh he may ba a. little green. 
When first I 
crossed the water and landr d

They extended then, to me, a 
welcome hand ; 
And they said you're welcome here, your country to us is 
dear, 
And we love you, the Irishman.

Then hurrile for Ainerica, the land of the free ! 
Sure that's the place, my boys, where there is no 
slavery. 
Oh ! I 
had not been there, very long when a 
war broke out, 
And spread its (I:isolation over the land ; 
When they railed upon the Irlshman to help go and fight, 
I 
gave to them, then a 
lielpinr band ; 
I 
enlisted in the tanks with many a 
noble man, 
Along with hrave 
rcoran and his noble crew 
And they marched us down Son .h 
to what they cell Dixie's 
land, 
To fight for the Red, White and Blue ! 
Then hurrah for America, kc. 
There is a 
nation that's been trying to cause America 
trouble. 
Of course, I 
mean the country called ..3pain 
But she'd better mind her business or she soon wil see, 
What is her loss will be Ama's gain ; 
For with Cuba annexed unto the 'United States, 
We'll add to their banner another star ; 
And I 
hope that Ireland soon will, like America, be free ! 
And you bet, the time is not so very far.

That one foot's as good as two.

IT SUITS POOR PAT. 
Written by Tom HARPLit. 
Respectfully dedicated to my 
friend Mn. PAT ROONEY. 
Oh ! my name it is Pat Rooney, 
And from Ireland I 
came ; 
Yes, rye lately emigrated from 
That little Isle so green ; 
To tell you what I 
like the best, 
So listen while I 
sing, 
I'll tell ye of a 
dainty dish, 
That's fit for any king. 
Cnottus. 
Then move not, speak not, until I 
do get through, 
I 
will spake out my mind, and tell you what is true ; 
You may talk about your cabbages, your turnips, and all 
that, 
But I 
love the Irish praties, for they suit poor Pat ! 
Some likes 'em biled, with the skins left on, 
And others, in a 
stew ; 
But I 
like them best of all my friend, 
When they are young and new; 
Just give to me a 
dozen or so. 
Most any time of day, 
And 1.11 show you how an Irishman 
With them will get away. 
Then move not, &e. 
Now you may like biled oysters. 
And others, quail on toast, 
And some they like good pork and beans, 
And others a 
good beef ; 
Well you can take them all, my boys, 
In welcome, too, at that ; 
But leave to me the praties, for 
They always suit poor Pat

TIM FLAHERTY, 
As sung by W ILLIAM SCANLAN. 
a nate Irish Paddy, a true Irish laddie, 
Audi came to this con try, great wanders to see; 
I 
sailed from swate Cork, for the Port of New York, 
And was eighteen long days sure crossing the sea. 
When I 
came to this land, I 
was took by the hand, 
By a 
fellow who says now come along with me, 
And ill show you the city, where the sigh ts.are so pretty, 
And then he says, Paddy, now what is your name? 
CHORUS. 
Arrah, Pm Tim Flaherty, new gaze upon me, 
A 
nate Irish Paddy is Tim Flaherty. 
Now we walked all around, and the sights We Seen found, 
And I 
gazed upon them with great astonishment-, 
Then he bade me good bye, the tears came to my eye, 
For I 
found he went t , rough me and took every cent, 
I 
knew not what to do, or faith where to go, 
So I 
went to the court house un explained to the Judgo 
When he called me a 
loafer, a 
fag-rant and toper, 
And gave me six months, n 
the Island above 
CHORUS.— Arrah, & c. 
Now, Whell I got out, sure I 
went straight about 
For to hunt ti,) an old friend, one Biddy McGee, 
And before me passed, arrah, I 
found her at last, 
And it's now that I've me..le her Mrs. Tim Floherty. 
Fts now that we'er wed, and our names are all said, 
And we are as happy as happy can be, 
Arrah,l'm Tim Flaherty, now gaze upon me, 
A 
nate Irish Paddy is Tim Flaherty.

I'VE just come here before you 
To tell ye who I 
am, 
And about a 
darling son of mine 
Who once d d 
lead a 
gang, 
lie was the terror of the neighborhood 
And the corners where he'd hang, 
But he's taken his father's and mother's advice. 
And entirely shook the gang. 
CHORtIs, 
lie's working now and he steals no more, 
lie's given up all t e 
slang; 
God only knows how proud I 
feel, 
Since Terry shook the gang. 
When he came from lie Island, 
I 
was as happy as a 
duke, 
lie sat down there beside the stove, 
And began to read his book. 
He says, dear father, I'll never go away, 
For FL never more steal a 
ham; 
Oh, I've given up all card playing, 
And entirely shook the gang. 
He goes to church every Sunday now, 
And works then all the week, 
He stays home in the evening, 
lie no longer roams the street; 
He never goes to hops or balls, 
Or strikes the door the oule bang; 
Oh, our hearts are tilled with joy, my friends, 
Since Terry shook the gang.

OH! if in

Be careful ho') you ch ose them, 
For real friends are hard to gain, 
And trifling tniT.'.gs may lose them. 
Hold out your hand to every palm 
That reaches forth to greet _,,

But keep your neart for those alone 
Who with pure friendship meet you. 
Then if in life a 
friend you'd find, 
Be careful how you choose one, 
True tri, lids are scarce amongst mankind 
A 
trifling thing may lose them.. 
A 
friend your heart may now relieve, 
And one day want relieving, 
So if from others you'd receive, 
Ne'er shrink from wisely giving. 
Be grateful when you find a

Th heart that's thankless, spurn it; 
Let conscience guide you to the end 
Take friendship and return it.

WHEN only a 
year in this country, 
And a 
month in this wonderful town ; 
Strang. things I 
have seen and s 
ranger things heard 
Which to me appeared queer I 
must own; 
I 
don't want you to think I'm perfoction, 
Nor I 
wouldn't be indeed if I 
could, 
Yet whenever I 
go among the rich or the poor, 
Th(re is some one to say I 
am no good. 
CHORL7S. 
For the boys in the street they cry out 
In a 
way can't be misunderstood; 
Will you ever go home to old Ireland; 
Murphy, lay down, you're no good. 
When first I 
arrived in the city, 
To a 
first-class hotel sure I 
went; 
Straight up Broadway I 
r 
rAbled, 
To vicw all the sights I 
was bent; 
Into a 
neat little gin-mill I 
wandered, 
Like a 
r 
al Irish gentle an should; 
When the puppy that sto C 
behind the bar, 
Says you can't hang me up, you're no good. 
For the Boys, Jic., 
Says I 
do I 
look ike a 
hangman,:, 
Or any of that rascally crowd; 
Who in Ireland for less than a 
shilling, 
To take a 
man's life would be proud; 
No, indeed, now 111 
friend, you don't know rne; 
Thou2-hpoor I 
might be and need food, 
Yet there is not a 
man in the country, 
Begorra could say I 
am no good 
For the Boys, &e. 
When at home I 
was a 
lit of a 
boxer, 
And could Ecla my own with the rest, 
And in many an off hand encounter, 
I 
was known to have come out the best; 
Yet I 
hardly reached Castle Garden, 
Scarcely knew, be dad, where I 
sto d, 
When a 
shaver shot up to my shoulder, 
Says Murphy, lay down, you're no good. 
For the Boys, &e. 
This saying at first did surprise me, 
But now I 
am used to it all, 
And along with the rest of the gang, 
I 
can daily be seen at die hall ; 
Now when the poor and the sick need assistance, 
By you all it is well understood, 
There is not a 
man in tile ward 
Will say Murphy, lay down you're no good. 
For the boys in the street, t" ey all shout, 
In a 
voice can't i.e misunde7stood, 
There goes Mr. Murphy the solid man, 
rare any of yc. u

I'VE been dreaming—oh, yes I've been dreaming— 
Of things that occur Wry day ; 
I've been dreamin,g, of people who worry 
And plod through the world la dismay; 
They grumble at all that's around them, 
And snarl like a 
cur in the street, 
While, if you attempt to approach them, 
They'll sq.:Arm like a 
snake at your feet. 
This world is as good as he make them, 
But snarlers, I 
say, we must " shake" them; 
For, no matter wha v 
ay you may take them, 
They'll wo ry and grumble the same. 
I've been dreaming— oh, yes, I've been dreaming— 
Of men who pretend to be tine, 
But neglect their poor wives and their daughters, 
That they may seek pleasure, and shine; 
They flirt t
- a 
the strEets and the highways, 
And car, y 
a 
proud, ea pty hea 
While in some dark alley or by ways 
Their children are crying for bread. 
Why m n 
act so queer and so bold, sir, 
Is not at all strange: f.u. we're told, sir, 
That a 
score of poor women are sold, sir, 
By armies of rascal:,ike these. 
I've hen dreamin---oh, yes, I've been dreaming— 
Of women who try to do well, 
But are always abused by their husbands 
For failin,-s too numerous to tell; 
If 
ict als ain't cooked right to suit them, 
They'll curse ev'ry thing in the land ; 
And if the p 
or woman disputes them, 
She'll feel the effects of a 
hand. 
A 
wife should be ever respected, 
And never at all be neglected, 
For surely she must feel affected 
At treatment she often receiv,s. 
I've been dreaming— oh, yes I've been dreaming— 
Of days in the future I 
see, 
When acts of the present will vanish, 
And all will be happy and free; 
As things at this time are progressing, 
A 
change f 
r 
the better we 
eed; 
For now it is really distressing 
To look on each dastardly di ed 
Let e 
cry one hereabouts plead it 
For surely a 
ch nge is much needed, 
And now is the time we should lead it, 
And have a 
reform in our laud. 
LAUGHING EYES OF BLUE 
DELETIANTY and cummisns• new duet. Written and Composed by 
W . 
11. D ELEHANTY. 
I 
KNOW a 
little maiden, fair and 3 
oung, 
The most bewitching creaturo in the village; 
Her face is like a 
garden of flowers newly sprung, 
And 53he dwells within a 
Ii tie rustic cot age. 
There may be other maidens just as fair, 
With the same bright, winsome, happy ways; 
But none have eyes half so lovely, 
Such a 
sweet, b 
witching gaze. 
Oh, yes; she is a 
beauty, 
So loving, kind and true, 
And the only girl to suit me, 
With her laughing eyes so blue. 
That's why I'm always happy, light and gay; 
Because, you see, my heart with love s 
laden; 
Cupid came and drove dull care away 
The day I 
met this pretty little maiden. 
CHORUS. 
I 
know she loves m d 
ar'y— 
Her actions prove it clearly--
That's why I'm always, etc 
One day, while we were walking side by side 
(I never shall forget the look she gave me,) 
I 
asked her f 
she'd be my own, my bride; 
She blushed and answered: '• Yes, if you will have me." 
Then threw her arms around my neck, 
Which I 
took not amiss, 
And in that happy moment 
You might have heard a 
kiss. 
Oh, yes; she loves me dearly, 
And I 
love her the same; 
And 
actions prove it clearly 
That she'd like to change her name. 
So there will be a 
weddin one fine day, 
And you will hear the merry bells a 
ringing. 
We'll live out in the country, where the new mown hay 
Shall perfume the air while merry birds are singing.--

Good evening to you one and all,

Acrooss the raging sea ;

am, an Irishman, 
And to work I'm not afraid 
While my son does carry the Pick, my boys, 
And I

And he bolds a

'Tis him that gives the tickets out

I 
come with news to-night, me boys. 
Just heed me for ft while ; 
My song will give delight. me boys, 
For it makes me grin an 1 
smile ; 
You've heard about that famous man, 
Who left us all in pain ! 
Sure ! he's back at last, all safe and sound! 
Mulcahy's home again ! 
CELOIMS. 
The shout and cheer and drink yer beer, 
No mote in grief remain ; 
For now the cry is everywhere, 
" 
Mulcahy's honi3 again !" 
I 
met him down in Chamhers Street, 
A 
week ago to- day ; 
And when I 
shook him by the hand, 
Sure, I 
thought I'd faint away' 
He's ag an.. stout, and walks about, 
In dress .3oth nate and cane ; 
says 1, with glee, " 
can this be," 
kluicaay's home again?" 
Then shout and cheer, Sze. 
I 
axed him why he f:tmysi away, 
And left us all behind! 
But a 
divil a 
word would he reply, 
To satisfy me mind ; 
He may have lived in foreign lands,— 
In Jarsey, or in Spain; 
But none will care . rom whence he came, 
When he's home with us again. 
Then shout and cheer, eze. 
He talks no more of Politics, 
He says he's had enough; 
To stand their capers and their tricks, 
One must be bold and tough! 
He thinks he'll start a 
corner store, 
And paint a 
sign so plain, 
To greet us when we reach the door— 
" 
Mulcahy's Home Again !"

WE often read of the power 
Of princes and of kings, 
Who stripp'd of all their grandeur, 
Are but poor mortal things; 
But there's a 
p.,wer strongcr, 
Which lasts for time untold, 
To which all men must bow and that's 
The bright, bright Gold. 
CnoRus. 
Gold, Gold, Gold I 
love to Lear it i 
Gold, Gold, Gold ! its power is untold, 
We men strive bard to store it, 
And woman she'll adore it, 
The best friend that a 
man can have is 
Gold, Gold, Gold! 
The man that's minus money, 
The world will cell a 
tlatt 
And pass him by, but if ne's rich, 
will gaily raise its hat; 
It sneers at the unlucky, 
But smiles on he who wins, 
And gold will gloss and cover, 
Quite a 
multitude of sins. ./ 
Gold, Gold, (SI,
,c. 
The maid both plain and ancient, 
Appears a 
perfect " sweet," 
If rich, her gold magnetic draws 
"Fond" lovers to her feet ; 
Seme say this Gold's a 
curse, and that 
It causes strife and pride, 
That we know it is a 
blessing, 
When its properly applied. 
Love and content in a 
cottage, 
I've heard of, so have you, 
But I 
fear that 1:;m1 of bliss, 
Is only experienced by few: 
When trouble conies unto the door, 
Love flies, or else grows cold, 
And the only thing to warm it up is 
Gold, Gold, Gold!

Sung by J. L. Txra. 
Now some girls are bashful, 
And others are bold, 
Now I 
khow a 
charm,r 
Of nineteen yearz old ; 
About her— like scum: o:hers— 
There was much pretense, 
For at th: least thing 
She'd be sure to commence with her) 
CHORUS. 
Oh, my! fIe, for shame, 
What would .Mamm I 
say? 
What would .1\.pa say? 
Oh, my ! lie, fcr shame ; 
Get along Joseph, Co. 
I'd take hr about 
To wherever she'd please 
When we were alone 
She'd appear ill at ease ; 
Now a 
hiss, once a 
week, 
Every fellowit expect, 
But when I 
tried fcr one. 
She'd be sure to object ( with ber) 
Ch, my! fie, for shame, Sze. 
Her Pa and her Ma 
Out of town chanced to be, 
So I 
called on my charmcr, 
And with her took tea ; 
The time like a 
slow 
Quaker's meeting did pass, 
Till she somehow by ace:dent 
Turned out the gas. 
SPOKEN.

we were all in the dark. 
I 
was afraid 
to L1GV3 for fear of breaking something, and she couldn't 
or wou'dn't find the matches ; when she found I 
didn'l 
move, she said--
Oh, my! fie 
for shame, &e. 
She seemed, oh, so awfully 
Coy and demure, 
That I 
thought her complaint 
Only marriage would cure ; 
So I 
asked, " If she wed, 
Did she think she would die ?" 
She pretended to faint, 
But her only reply was— 
Oh, my 
fie, for shame, 8:13. 
Now I 
found out this bashful 
And timid young lamb 
Was simply a 
con-
glom-cr-a-tion of sham ; 
To two other ptrties 
ILr kisses v-ero free ; 
Perhaps she had one of them, 
But she didn't ‘• have me," ( with her)

PULL DOWN 1TE BLIND. 
As s 
zing by TONY PASTOR. 
DID you ever make love? If not. have a 
try, 
I 
courted a 
girl on(71,, 
so bashful and shy, 
A 
tor little creature who by the by, 
At coaxing and wheedlinir, had such a 
nice way; 
Ey'ry night to her house I 
went, 
In harmless del glit our evenings were spent, 
She had a 
queer snyin7, whatever it meant, 
For whenever I 
entered her house she would say : 
coolies. 
Pull down the blind, pull down the blind, 
Pull down the blind, love, come don't be unkind,. 
Though were alone, bear this in mind, 
Somebody's looking, love, pull down the blind. 
How loving we were, how cosy we'd chat, 
'Bout one tiling and rother, and this thing and that, 
With my arm round her waist, how cosy we sat, 
Like two little turtle- doves perched on a 
tree; 
Such squeezing and tolsing and ple isinf2; we had— 
Such wooing and cooing to mak our hearts glad, 
With laieThin ,r 
and chaffing I 
near drove her mad; 
But still she was awfully spooney on me. 
SPOKEN — And if that soldier would only have left us alone, 
she would never have exclaimed: 
Pull down the blind, etc. 
It  
It 
One night, for a 
change, we went to the play, 
And when we got home she was awfully gay, 
Sho saw them make love, and so learned the way, 
The piece was " Claude Melnotte," and suited her fine; 
She called me her rose- bud, her duck, and her dear, 
She threw her arms round me, while fast fell each tear; 
She cried, oh, don't leave me, for sadly I 
fear 
You don't love me truly, say, will you be mine? 
SPOKEN,—Just at that moment a 
policem,:n passed, and she 
said: 
Our courting days o'er, at last we were wed, 
I 
oft bless the hour when to church her I 
led, 
I 
now call her Mary, she calls me Ned, 
We're happy and loving, and never know strife; 
We've a 
fine handsome lass, and two noble boys, 
Trouble or sorrow, never us annoys; 
Of life we've the sweets, and while tasting its joys, 
I'm thankful Fm blessed with a 
good little w.fe. 
SPOKEN.—And should an angry word rise to my lips, with a 
meek smile on her face she'll exclaim:

-rwAs in the pleasant summer time, I met him all by 
chance, 
The robins sang their sweetest rhyme, and loving was his

We wander'd 'mid the blooming flow'rs, he called me sweet

Those eyes that shone with sparkling glow, the day when 
first we met; 
The lilies all will fade and die, the birds will fly away,

It is a
