I should l
ike to thank you and your staff for the excellent cooperation
 
you gave me in arranging the details of the secent California Folklore
 
Society meetings on this campus.  '
Everything in your department went
 
extremely smoothly with the s
ingle exception of the mixup over
 
Engineering 1
00 on April 1
9th, and I feel that was at l
east as much
 
my fault as anyone else's.  But I would l
ike to compliment your
 
staff on their efficiency during the planning s
tages and most
 
especially on how unfailingly pleasant your officers were in directing
 
l
ost folklorists around the campus.  Several members of the Society
 
commented to me spontaneously on the courteous and helpful treatment
 
afforded their
s by the officers on duty at the parking kiosk on Friday
 
and Saturday.
 
Since I suspect your share of brickbats these days -
- as do we all -

thought a bouquet might make a p
leasant change of pace.  Please consider
 
one thrown.

I am enclosing a check to cover the amount billed me for the
 
California Folklore Society luncheon, April 1
9th.
 The Department
 
of Anthropology underwrote the expenses for the coffee served
 
on that same day, so payment will reach you for that amount from
 
another source.
 
I would also l
ike to express my regrets again for the inconvenience
 
caused your staff by the large numbers of people who apparently
 
decided only that day to stay and have lunch with us.
 I knew there
 
would be at least five extra by ten o
'clock but had absolutely no
 
idea that there would be ah additional sixteen!
 I am sorry for the
 
confusion, but I would l
ike to congratulate your staff on its
 
ability to rise to the situation and cope with it with such efficiency
 
and courtesy.
 Several people remarked on the ease and speed with
 
which the extra people were accomodated and how polite and welcoming
 
your entire staff was.
 Also the quality of the food was excellent!
 
It was a delicious lunch and most successful from the Society's point
 
of view.

one of those rare people who thinks that the function of a service department
 
is to serve,  Ixzi&kz:khzzmzx& =

D
ear Bess:
 
If you or any of y
,our students would l
ike to come to the critique
 
described in the attached announcement, please join us.  The motivation
 
for t
he critique came from several of our students, who have both
 
constructive criticisms and specific suggestions (as well a
s the usual
 
k
inds of questions) about CFS meetings.
 
I continue to feel that the meeting went better than most that I
 
have attended, thanks to your hard work and good planning.

Dear Bess:
 
I think your suggestion is a good one to have a University of
 
California Press exhibit.  I have asked Barnard Norris to arrange it
 
if he can.
 
I was secretly hoping that the Program Committee would find someone
 
who looks a little more like George Jessel than I do to be Master of
 
Ceremonies at the banquet; however, since you put it so generously, I
 
will be happy to do my usual thing.  It sounds as though you have every-
thing neatly organized and under control.  I hope there will be a lot of
 
students there.  We can afford, you know, to let them in without paying
 
the registration fee, even though our membership registration may be
 
light.  If more .
funds are needed (
within reasonable limits, of course)
 
to balance the budget, the California Folklore Society has a small
 
reserve.
 
Sincerely,
 
Hector H
. Lee

California Folklore Society Luncheon (April 1
9th, 1

Concerning the attached contract, the time of the l
uncheon should be
 
changed from 1
:00 till 1
:15, I think, since i
t turns out our prior
 
session will run until 1
:00.  Concerning the program at the
 
luncheon i
tself, the Society uses the occasion to conduct a brief
 
business meeting but there i
s no formal speaker.  I am sure we can just
 
work around your clearing problems; however, we would l
ike to be
 
able to use the room for perhaps an hour and a half (
eating t
ime
 
included).  There will, as it l
ocks now, be closer to thirty than
 
forty guests, so I
'll trust you to arrange tables in the most
 
appropriate manner.

POs
 The Officers c
-
f the California Folklore Society
 
e .:
,
N  Hector H
. Lee, Executive Vice President
 
S M:  New Blood
 
On April 19, 1969, at San Fernando Valley State College, we'll be holding our
 
annual business meeting.  I hope you can all be present.  ne conference will
 
be worth coming f
or, e
ven if the business meeting may not be.  Until then,
 
here is something t
o b
e thinking about.
 
Certain new officers will need to be elected, and I am asking the Regional
 
Vice Presidents i
n attendance plus Al Friedman plus Barney "
Iorris t
o be the
 
nominating committee.  A new Regional Vice President will be elected t
o r
e-
place Sam Hinton, whose term expires this year.
 
also, I have decided r
i
ot to stand up for re-election, so you will be looking
 
f
or a new E
Sce;utive V
ice President.  There are several good people available,
 
I think:  any of the Regional Vice Presidents world be eligible (
including
 
those of you who might be present), or such people an Bob Georges, Alan Dundee,
 
Don Ward, Ed Cray, Ed
. Kahn, Peter Tamony
 „ etc.
,  You will think of other
 
possibilities.  I have not mentioned any of the old guard: Bascom, Hand,
 
Tidwell, Girdler, Bronson, Wilgus--that sterling group of proven leaders--because
 
they are full professors, their careers are already made, and i
n my opinion they
 
do not need the
' oppo•rtunity to grow professionally through this office.  But
 
that's only my view, and in this context it is entirely gratuitous; you will, of
 
course, nominate anyone
 yo
^u cho
w.
 
As f
or me, I have made up my mind that the j
ob should go to someone else.  I
 
have held it down f
or about ten years.  It has been p
leasant, a
nd I have always
 
had the enthusiastic support of the other officers and the membership.  For
 
this I am grateful.  I hope I have been able to do the Society some good.
 
If you w
ish, I can continue the Sourdough o
Cr ck another year or two--antil
 
some new officer comes forward to take itr over or to replace i
t with another
 
kind of Newsletter.  I a
rmy have birthed it -0 but I have no maternal attachment
 
to it.  I have been proud of its almost universal acceptance and popularity,
 
but I know f
ull well that sooner or later someone will come along with a
 
better idea; when he does, the Society should be ready t
o accept it.
 
I
'll see you all, I hope, next month.

OFFICE OF THE DEAN OF THE COLLEGE
 
Dear Bess:
 
October 25, 1958
 
We don't want to schedule a conference in conflict with the
 
anthropologists; many of our good members will want to go to both
 
meetings.
 
It seems to me, therefore, that a good date for us would be
 
April 18 and 19.  `hat would give us a Friday and Saturday.  We
 
could go over into Sunday the 20th if we wanted to, but that
 
should depend on the plans and wishes of the program chairman or
 
chairmen working with you.
 
I am planning to ask Don Ward and Ed Cray to act as co-Chairmen
 
of the program.
 I am hoping that they will counter-balance each
 
other and give us the best of two worlds: scholarly respectability
 
and a faithful following among the traditional scholars on the one
 
hand and fresh new and daring ideas.
 
I
'll ask Ward to phone you as soon as he can, and perhaps the
 
three of you can get together and work out plans.
 
Yours,
 
Hec
- or H Lee

Hear Lew:
 
I
'm enclosing a schedule for the airport bus in hopes that this
 
w
ill make your journey to SFVSC more convenient.  Please be sure
 
to note, however, the caveat at the bottom of the page; I don't
 
quite know what i
t weans, but assume i
t's t

Anthropology Department at the college when you get to the motel,
 
should you need a r
ide to the cam pus and I
'll have someone come
 
over to pick you up.
 (
349-1200, extension 7

I
've spoken 4
zb a few people concerned with arrangements for the
 
meeting about your request to have the sessions taped, and run
 
into a great deal of oppositional static.  In view of the vehemence
 
of the objections vo$ced to me, it appears that we should thrash
 
this out at the board meeting rather than just going ahead on our
 
own.  How about raising i
t at the l
uncheon meeting?  Or I will, if
 
you prefer; it seems to me we should try to arrive at an official
 
continuing policy on this watter, rather than having i
t decided
 
by one or two people each year.
 
I

Dr. Hector Lee

Rohnert Park, California
 
Dear Hector:
 
Just a quick note which I hope you can forward on to someone else so
 
that you won't have to fiddle with it yourself . It occurs to me and
 
Bob Georges that we should have a table set up at the registration
 
desk during the spring meetings where WESTERN FOLKLORE can be displayed
 
and memberships in the Society solicited . I could see that this i
s
 
done, and staff the table , if you could have the necessary materials
 
sent to me , preferably a few days ahead of time.  Or perhaps someone
 
from the University of California Press should do it; come to think of it, a
 
display of U
.C. Press books would be nice too.  We will be setting aside
 
one rood for registering , drinking coffee, socializing and general
 
relaxing ,
 and I should think that a display of books there would be
 
well patronized . I don't want to get too elaborate about thinvs though,
 
since so far the advance registration has been disappointing.  What
 
do you think?
 
Also , in case Bob Georges hasn't already written you about this, we are
 
hoping to be able to cajole you into giving your services as master of
 
ceremonies at the banquet . I fear you are in the position of "everlasting
 
rope -turner" as far as the California Folklore Society i
s concerned.
 
Please don 't feel exploited ,
 and please do accept.  The program so far
 
includes Charles Seeger as speaker and then the Dance Department at UCLA
 
will be showing a short film of Yugoslavian peasant dance . We are also
 
urging some of the graduate students in folk music at UCLA to bring their
 
instruments with then, and hope that people may want to stay around after
 
the formal program for some music and talk.  We have the restaurant room
 
for the whole evening and the bar will remain open , so perhaps this way we
 
can bridge that awkwaud gap for the out-of-towners that occurs between the
 
end of the banquet and time-to -go-to-bed.
 
I
'll l
ook forward to seeing you on the 1
8th.

 SPACE ALLOCATION FOR CALIFORNIA FOLKLORE ASSOCIATION MEETING
 
In order to hold a professional conference, the Anthropology Department
 
requests that the following rooms be reserved for Friday afternoon
 
April 1
8 and all day April 1
9,  1
969:
 
SAS 214,  220, 222, 238, 239 (and 239A), 240.
 
These are the, minimum rooms necessary to handle the conference of the
 
California Folklore Association.
 If possible, for optimum success of
 
the meetings, all rooms on the west half of Sierra Hall South should
 
be reserved.
 
For any professional meeting, all rooms should be centrally and
 
adjacently located in order to facilitate movement of participants
 
between sections of papers being delivered.
 We will have between three
 
and five simultaneous sessions in progress at the same time on these
 
days.
 Papers will be given according to major topic under discussion.
 
Participants will want to be able to move from one section to another
 
in order to catch various papers dealing with particular interest topics.
 
Having the rooms centrally and adjacently located is imperative given the
 
fact that a large percentage of the participants will be coming from
 
out of town and will be unfamiliar with the campus.
 By centrally
 
locating the rooms, in addition, we will be able to post signs advising
 
that the conference is in session, thereby avoiding interruptions from
 
"lost debaters."
 
In addition to the above room, several additional rooms (of more modest
 
size) should be available for participants to hold informal conferences
 
of their own.
 Participants will be attending this conference from all of
 
the Western States (Texas, Oregon, etc.)  They will want to be able to carry
 
on informal professional functions (
such as hiring) which are a major part
 
of any regional professional meeting.
 Ample space for this type of
 
function must be offered.
 
In the eight years of existence of the Department of Anthropology, we cave
 
never been honored by hosting a professional meeting.
 This is our first
 
opportunity and we wish to have the most successful meeting possible.
 
Of course, a successful meeting will affect these professionals' evaluation
 
of San Fernando Valley State College and its Department of Anthropology.
 
Having recently inaugurated our graduate program, we want to give our
 
students the opportunity to participate in a professional meeting (as part
 
of their training).
 Ample accomodations must be available.
