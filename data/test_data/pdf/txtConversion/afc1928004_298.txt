As Sung by Tut; BRATTAMA. 
I've heard folks sing of moonlight walks, 
And rambling in the dell. 
Or strolling down the promenade, 
And by the village well. 
Bu i 
courting i a 
pleasure, 
AU young folks so admire— 
(live me a 
bit of courting 
In the Winter. by the fire. 
Client's. 
Draw near the fire, 
Draw near the fire; 
Fireside courting I 
so much admire ; 
What nice words are said. 
When old folks are in bed. 
Laughing and joking ( lose by the tirr.. 
As Sung by THE BRAHAMS. 
I'm a 
very romantic young lady, 
On poetry fondly I 
doat. 
I'm fond of nooks, quiet and shady, 
And Byron incessantly quote— 
And Byron incessantly quote. 
Iv friends, ev'ry one, say I'm pensive, 
(Tho' I'm never oppress'd with ennui,) 
And they say that they feel apprehensive 
Lest perchance I 
an old maid should be. 
CHORUS. 
I'm known as poetical Ettie, 
As I 
stroll on the beach or the jetty ; 
And to ev'ry kind friend, 
Such sweet sonnets I 
send, 
So charming, so graceful and pretty. 
I 
write for the " Family Herald," 
Short stanzas and verses, at times ; 
And though I've not the wit of a 
Jerrold, 
Pm never deficient in rhymes ; 
I'm never deficient in rhymes. 
I 
oft write a 
sonnet or ditty, 
'Bout moonlight and sweet sily'ry streams ; 
They are certainly not very witty, 
But I 
always avoid two extremes. 
enonus. 
I'm known as Poetical Ettie, 
And verses I 
oft send to Betty : 
Rut somehow I 
find 
They are thankfully declin'd— 
And yet they are all very pretty. 
Some may think, who aro given to mocking, 
" 
Those girls of the Period" I 
mean; 
That just because I'm a 
blue stocking. 
I'm in slang parlance " awfully green"--
I'm in slang parlance " awfully green." 
In that case, they're certainly rushing 
To erroneous conclusions, I 
think; 
if they fancy because I 
am gushing. 
I 
am always beclabbled with ink:— 
I'm known as, &e. 
Now, I'm certain, although I'm romantic, 
And what lit'rary men call a " blue," 
I'm by no means stuck up or pedantic, 
And no one can say I'm a 
shrew ; 
And no one can say I'm a 
shrew. 
Then there's one fact I 
have not yet stated, 
It may sound rather strange, but ' tis true, 
That I'm perfectly domesticated, 
I 
can make bread, and bake, boil, or brew. 
I'm known as, dze. 
I've a 
heart that is loving and tender, 
And sub rosa, between me and you, 
I 
wish I'd a 
noble defender, 
To answer an unkind review; 
To answer an unkind review. 
For those critics give me such a 
slating, 
They declare I 
am not a " true blue ;" 
But that question it's no use debating, 
Altho' I'm not yet Seventy-two. 
For I'm known as, dr„c.

As Sung by THE BRAT:TAMS. 
I'm one of those very unfortunate men 
You read of. and sometimes oehold. 
No matter how careful I 
am. now and then 
1 
feel certain I'm sure to be sold : 
For I'm always meeting with people who try 
To ease me of what I 
possess. 
Which they very soon do, though I've got a 
sharp eye, 
And so I'm compelled to confess,—that 
CHORUS. 
They're a 
little too old for me, 
Rather too old for me; 
Though youthful in years, to me it appears, 
They're a 
little too old for me. 
If ever I 
go to the races. I'm sure 
To come home with tar less than I 
start , 
For even if I 
back the horse that has won, 
1 
can't get the fellows to part. 
In fact, l'm welshed when I 
fancy I'm right, 
And sharpers get off with my pelf; 
So, when I 
return home a 
skinner, at night, 
I'm forced to admit to myself,-- that 
They're a 
little, k 
I'm a pretty good player at billiards, I'm toil, 
I 
can handle the cards pretty wed. 
Put I'm bound to be done if I 
play for much gold, 
The reason I 
really cant 
But, perhaps, just a 
game or two I 
may win, 
That is if the stakes are but small ; 
But when, at the finish, I 
lose all my tin, 
I'm forced to admit, after all,—that 
They're a 
little, 
With the fair sex I'm no better off, I 
declare. 
I 
can't get on that way at all— 
Except the girl turns out more ugly than fair— 
Or her fortune ' tis wretchedly small 
Though the wealthy and gay are awfully fond 
Of flirting, just in a 
mild way; 
But as for the ladies going beyond, 
Vrom experience I'm bound to say, —that 
0! when I 
was a 
littIe-bOy 
I 
was not very big; 
I 
used to walk on hands and knees, 
As fat as a 
little pig. 
My mammy'd squeeze me in her arms, 
And say I 
was her joy ; 
By jingo, they were jolly times, 
When I 
was a 
little boy. 
CHORUS. 
Oh I 
when I 
was a 
little boy, 
A " sweet" little boy, a " dear" little boy— 
'Tween you and me I'd like to he 
A 
little boy again. 
When I 
was sleepy they would " lay 
Me in my litle bed :" 
If I 
fell down how they would run 
To rub my little head. 
They'd give me chums and sugar plums, 
Which I 
would much enjoy; 
But now, they'd let me break my neck, 
'Cause I'm not a 
little boy. 
So I'd like to be,, 
c. 
They'd give me pretty rides ; and oh ! 
So pretty they would talk ; 
But now, I 
find that whenever I 
want 
To ride, I 
have to walk. 
Then I 
used to kiss what girls I 
liked, 
They never, then, seemed coy— 
If I 
did so now I'd get a 
month, 
'Cause I'm not a 
little boy. 
So I'd like to be, Ite. 
They'd give me all I 
fancied, 
There was nothing too good in the town ; 
And an uncle often gave me 
A 
glorious brand new crown: 
But now I 
may fancy what I 
please, 
Want of cash my wants destroy, 
And there's many an " uncle's" lent me a 
crown, 
Since I 
was a 
little boy. 
I 
used to fish in our water butt, 
With some cotton and a 
pin, 
And now and then I 
would contrive 
Head first to tumble in : 
And then my dear old dad would come, 
And some time he would employ, 
For he'd go and he'd get a 
nice little stick 
And he'd wallop his little boy. 
CHORUS. 
-Yes, then I 
was a 
little boy, 
A 
sore little boy, a 
raw little boy ; 
But, ' tween you and me. I'd like to be 
A 
little boy again. 
As Sung by Tun BnActxms. 
Pon my life I'm so dreadfully naughty, 
I'm always at some naughty act ; 
clon't want to startle you ladies, 
By stating so well known a 
fact. 
In confidence, mind, it's a 
secret, 
You'll keep it- --I 
know ladies can— 
I 
am, oh ! I 
am, though I 
say it, 
am such a 
naughty young man. 
CHORUS. 
Pon my life, now, I'm dreadfully naughty, 
Oh ! so naughty—very naughty ; 
And the ladies ' twixt sixteen and forty, 
Say I 
am such a 
naughty young man. 
I 
once took my Grandma to Greenwich, 
She paid for the shrimps and the tea; 
But then we gay naughty young fellows, 
Do love, so, a 
deuce of a 
spree ; 
We didn't get home till past seven— 
The evening was growing quite dark, 
Mamma wa.:; so anxious about us— 
But then we, fast boys love a 
lark ! 
Spagys.—I was always of a 
fast turn of mind; I 
go in for 
glorious dissipation, keep white mice and silk-worms— 
the silk-worms are fast too—I

love a 
joke, but then— 
Pon my life, now, /kc. 
I've a 
cousin, and she's Uncle's daughter, 
I 
took her out once for a 
walk, 
You'd really have thought we were lovers, 
To judge from our looks and our talk ; 
She into a 
pastry-cook's, took me, 
And I 
had two tarts and an ice ; 
And that you'll admit's dissipation, 
And filling besides. at the price.

At '• Kiss in the King" I'm considered, 
A

And at that fast game '• Hunt the Slipper," 
They call um a

At Christmas the ladies avoid me, 
'Cos, under the Misletoe bough 
I

And didn't I

The poets have sung about women and wine, 
But smoke is the theme of this ditty of mine ; 
I 
look on my pipe as a 
trusty old friend, 
Who's faithful whatever luck fortune may send ; 
Wherever I 
travel, north, east, west or south 
I've always a 
pipe or cigar in my mouth, 
For when I 
am smoking I'm up in a 
cloud, 
But of course, never go where no smoking's allowed. 
CHORUS. 
No smoking allow'd, what a

When they put out my pipe I

No smoking allow'd, what a

One day, by express on the Great Eastern line,

I'd lighted my pipe, and was watching the curl 
Of the smoke, when there popp'd in a 
pretty young girl 
I 
cried " smoking carriage" the train was just ott, 
Of course I 
could not make the dear creature cough, 
So put down my pipe and submissively bow'd 
To my fate, which I 
felt was " No smoking allow'd." 
No smoking allowed, 
looked at the ceiling, I 
fear, with a 
frown, 
I 
looked at the lady, of course, she looked down; 
I °tiered the paper, of weather I 
spoke, 
And talked about steam tho' I 
thought about smoke, 
So charming a 
damsel I'd never seen before, 
But soon I 
admired her fifty times more ; 
One small remark proved she with sense was endowed, 
She said, '• Go on smoking, sir, smoking's allowed." 
No smoking allowed, Atc. 
In comfort the rest of the journey was passed, 
I'd met with a 
sensible woman at last, 
And now we are married, I, oft say in joke ; 
Our joys and our sorrows have ended in smoke. 
She knows that those ladies who smoke cannot bear, 
Have husbands who take pipes and glasses elsewhere, 
So ladies pray try to get used to a 
cloud, 
And don't join the cry of " DO smoking allowed." 
No smoking allowed, &c.

THE LITTLE HIBERNIAN HARP. 
Written and compoaed by SAY. BAGNALL. Sung by Jr:Nustr. EX4EL 
Al! 
well I 
remember, one frosty December 
The winds whistled cold and the snow it fell sharp, 
3aw a 
young maiden whose arms were (mite laden, 
;She carried a 
little Hibernian harp; 
Hie , topped near the door of a 
mansion so stately, 
Tile lights from the windows shone full in her face, 
thought it my duty to watch that young beauty 
Whose foot pressed the snow with such delicate grace. 
CHORUS. 
The wind whistled keenly, but she sang serenely, 
And tinkled her little Hibernian harp, 
The wind whistled keenly, but she sang serenely, 
And tinkled her little Hibernian harp. 
Bright jewels were shining, ' mid tresses entwining 
On heads of fair beauties, all blushes and sigh, 
But they saw not the beautiful jewels that sparkled 
And fell from the lids of this poor maiden's eyes 
As over the harp strings her fingers were straying 
The notes on the night wind came plaintive and slow 
The pale lamp of heaven shone forth on the maiden 
Who stood like a 
statue transfixed to the snow. 
And the wind, ttc. 
I 
spoke to this maiden, whose heart was so laden, 
Who stood so forlorn in the streets for a 
while, 
Her sobs rung my heart as she answer'd me sadly, 
And said I 
am far from the Emerald Isle ; 
My parents are dead and I 
wander dejected, 
In search of a 
boy that I 
love and adore ; 
'Re's long since departed from me brolzen-heattA, 
And I 
inn alone far from Erin's green shore. 
'I he wind whistled, S7c. 
Need I 
say, I 
saw her, with bright hopes before her. 
Embark in a 
vessel for Erin's green shore, 
I 
watched her on deck ' till the evening's dark shadows 
Shut out from my sight, and I 
saw her no more ; 
On a 
cold winter's night as I 
sit by the fire, 
And mournful winds whisper that snow's falling sharp. 
I 
think o. the desolate, poor Irish maiden 
Who tinkl&I the little Hibernian harp. 
The wind whistled, &-c.

" 
Gang awa," was Donald's cry, 
" 
Let's hae nae mair parley ;" 
As the piper, standing by. 
Strum up " Rigs o' Barley." 
Donald was a 
wealthy lad, 
But music was not in him : 
Bagpipes alwa s 
drove him mad; 
The piper could not win him. 
But alack! one summer day 
He cross'd Loch Leven's water ; 
And he met upon his way, 
The piper and his daughter. 
Donald look'cl, and Donald saw 
Bonnie gray eyes glancing, 
And his heart was beating time 
While those eyes were dancing. 
Donald gaz'd with soul amaz'd, 
While he stood before them; 
And never stirr'd, although he heard 
That horrid " Tullochgorum." 
The old man play'd, yet Donald stay'cl, 
Each moment seeming shorter; 
The piper's drone had chang'd its tone 
Beside the piper's daughter. 
Alack! alas ! it came to pass 
That Donald cross'd Loch Leven 
As often, and as willingly, 
As though it lead to Heaven 
A 
wondrous change came o'er his mind, 
He thought the bagpipes pleasant ; 
But then the piper he was blind, 
And those gray eves were present. 
Donald loved the old man's child, 
With golden ling he sought her, 
rd took the pipes and piper homer 
Ae well as piper's eta-nal:ter

Never was Meant for the Sea. 
[Copyright.) 
As Sung by HARRY BRAHAM. 
When I 
was yet of tender age, 
I 
thought I'd go to sea; 
A 
boat I 
often would engage, 
And paddle merrily ; 
And when by skimming up and down, 
Experience I 
had got— 
I 
said I 
was not born to drown— 
By jove, I'll start a 
yacht. 
CHORUS. 
But that queer sort of up and down motion, 
Which one meets on the treacherous ocean ; 
Has inspired me, at length, with a 
notion 
I 
never was meant for the sea. 
I 
bought nay yacht, I 
hired my crew, 
We look'd a 
tidy craft; 
No end of naval terms I

But when the ship began to roll, 
And skies were black and dark, 
pledg'd my whole immortal soul, 
To sell my new bought bark ! 
For that queer sort, &c. 
Gilt buttons and a 
sailor's cap,

But pleasure on the ocean's lap. 
To say the least, is rough ;

THE BELLE OF THE RINK. 
As Sung by THE BRAHAMS. 
'Twas down beside the sad sea waves, 
That I 
first met fair Helen ; 
At once my heartfelt Cupid's dart, 
'Gailist which there's no rebelling. 
I 
asked her, ‘• Would she have a 
sail ?" 
She answered—what d'ye think ? 
" 
Not me, no fear it makes me queer, 
For I'm the Belle of the Rink," 
CHORUS. 
Yes, Pm the Belie of the Rink, 
The Skating Rink's now all the go, 
It's awfully jolly, don't you know, 
To be the Belle of a 
Skating Rink ! 
I'd not essayed the skates before, 
But when I 
saw her action. 
I'd try awhile, she gave a 
smile, 
Rap easing satisfaction ; 
But, oh ! no Aooner did I 
start, 
(I'd not e'en time to wink,) 
Ere on my back I 
came a 
crack. 
Beside the Belle of the Rink! 
Yes, I'm the Belle, :!.z.e. 
She helped me up officiously, 
But had no sooner done so. 
Than butt I 
ran against a 
man. 
Who didn' see the f 
on so ; 
With his two fists he pommelled me. 
And made any poor eyes blink— 
But where was she ? I 
could not see 
The beauteous Belle of the Rink! 
Yes, l'm the Belle, kc. 
I 
soon imioved thu hateful skates, 
Then in my pockets feeling. 
I 
found my purse, and what was worse. 
My watch they had been stealing! 
"That lady and her friend are gone,'' 
The man said, with a 
wink. 
"My ! you was green or you'd ha' seeii. 
She ain't no Belle of the Itink !" 
Yes, I'm tlo. Bell, kc. 
I 
never saw fair Helen more. 
Nor yet my watch and money, 
nd have not tried again to slide. 
Which p'rhaps you think is funny, 
iatit now I 
warn young gentlemen. 
Who're not perfection's pink, 
To hare a

Bright American Girls, dear American Girls ! 
Fair American Girls for me. 
Talk not of damsels

With dark flashing glance ; 
Proud Spanish maidens, 
Though haughty and grand. 
Can ne'er equal those 
Of our dear native land. 
Fair American Girls, & e. 
No American e'er spreads 
His fair sails to the wind. 
But sighs for some dear one

And though he may wander. 
The world o'er and o'er; 
No fairer maids meet him, 
Than those we adore. 
Fair American Girls. &c. 
Each darling may rival, 
The Lily or Rose!

Her fair American Girls.

DON'T BOTHER ME, CHARLIE. 
As Sung by THE BEAHAMS. 
Oh! dear, what a 
plague and a 
bother 
Now all you men are to be sure ; 
Its really too bad, ' pon my honor, 
In fact, I 
may say quite a 
bore; 
There's Charlie does nothing but worry me 
All about naming the day ; 
But, I 
tell him that fin in no hurry, 
And often he makes me say— 
CHORUS. 
" 
Don't bother me, Charlie, 
Don't you be such a 
tease ! 
It's no use, Charlie, 
I 
shall marry whenever I 
please I" 
You men you are all such deceivers, 
We find you out more ey'ry day ; 
And we girls are such silly believers 
In ev'rything you choose r) say ; 
Such sweet, pretty, soft little speeches 
Such devotion, ah! never wvs seen; 
only sometimes experience teaches, 
That you've said rather more than you mean! 
" 
Don't bother," & c. 
You all say that as soon as you're married, 
You'll settle down quiet in life ; 
And never away you'll be carried, 
From your dear little, good little wife ; 
Hut, oh ! I've known one or two cases, 
Where the dear loving husband will roam ! 
And you'll see him in all sorts of places, 
But seldom you'll see him al /tome ! 
"Don't bother," 
e 
r 
Charlie says he will do something shocking 
For a 
soldier, or sailor he'll go ; 
Or hang himself up with his stocking ! 
I 
hope he don't mean it, you know. 
Of course, I 
should not like to lose him, 
For I 
do think thnt Charlie is true; 
And, perhaps, it's not right to abuse him— 
I 
don't think it is, now,—do you?

"NEVER GIVE IN." 
As Sung by Mr- BIZAHANS. 
Now, if you wiil listen a 
mon,,
,
..nt or two, 
I'll sing yon a 
bit of a 
rhyme, 
And tell you what I 
thinli 
ni<Ln must do, 
To make the bent use of his time : 
k He must keep up his pluck, and must laugh at bad lue*':. 
And be brAve if he means to win ; 
His eye must be bright. and his heart must be right. 
And his motto be, •• Never give in." 
Caor.r3. 
Then keep yourselves steadily moving, Lids, 
For laziness never can win ; 
Let hand and heart each play a 
part. 
And your motto be " Never give in." 
Since the days of my youth I 
have traveled a, bit, 
And sojourned in many a 
clime ; 
And I 
think of the truth I've unravelled a 
bit, 
Although I 
am still in my prime ; 
And this I 
have found, in my journeying round 
'I he world, from the East to the West, 
That he who has gone most steadily on, 
Is a 
happier man than the rest, 
Then keep, 
c. 
I'll help a 
poor brother whenever I 
can, 
But a 
thing most offensive to me, 
Is to see a 
great lubbering lump of a 
man, 
With a 
heart of the size of it pea ; 
So as long as I 
live, this maxim I 
give 
To youngsters about to begin ; 
Don't falter or shirk, but stick to your work, 
4.. 
Be patient, and ' Never give in." 
Then & c. 
Then forward ! my lads, and you're sure to be right, 
Don't wait ' till your chances are gone ; 
'Us better to struggle and fall in the fight, 
Than stand pun Took slothfully on; 
And when in your grave, ' twill be said you were bravc. 
And men will be proud of your kin ; 
They'll say th it you tried, and you manfully died 
In your harness, but " Never gave in."

P.A.T.,Pn W ATTS, 
One morn when thinking o'er event 
In our Central Park so great, 
On a 
rustic bench I 
sat, 
O'er things to ruminate ; 
When sleep o'ercame me for a 
time, 
A. dense mist did arise ; 
A 
panorama of strange forms 
Did pass before my eyes ! 
I 
raised aloft my wond'ring gaze, 
It seemed to pierce the clouds. 
As by me pass'd, in strange arra: -, 
A. great and bustling crowd. 
I 
notic'd each familiar face, 
And marked each stirring scene, 
The record of a 
hundred years— 
I 
saw them in my dream. 
The fog to me it cleared away, 
There came a 
brilliant light, 
And as a 
Keystone to the Arch 
Theie shone a 
rainbow bright! 
And in the centre Freedom stood, 
Aloft— she rais'd her hand— 
And pointed, as they pass'd me by, 
Tint ) the patriot band ! 
I 
saw the men cf Boston march, 
So noiseless to the Sea, 
To strike the Keynote of our fame, 
And overthrow the tea ; 
And then I 
saw them swiftly go 
To Concord's distant town, 
Where low the Union Jack did drool, 
By Freedom's sons cast down. 
I 
next saw Lafayette embark 
To cross the raging main ; 
Saw Warren lying stark and stiff. 
When t‘ jie laLtt 
71,i P. 
Saw Putnam ride his gallant steed 
Way down those stairs, so swift, 
And Washington upon the ice 
Of Delaware, adrift! 
I 
next did see our gallant boys 
In Valley Forge, forlorn ; 
And still their hearts with patriot fir 
Defied the wintry storm ; 
Then came upon my vision 
A 
dark cloud in the sky— 
It was the traitor, Arnold, 
That in shame was passing by. 
A 
ray of ligh:; the cloud dispelled, 
As Paulding,glided by 
With Major Andre in his grasp, 
As he went forth to die ! 
Saw Jefferson the paper write, 
Which made us slaves no more ! 
Our glorious Constitution, boys! 
As wrote in days of yore : 
Saw Lincoln sign the Freedom 
Of all men throughout the land! 
And Ethan Allen take the Fort, 
By Lake Champlaine does stand; 
Saw Jackson with his cotton bales, 
Defy the invading foe ; 
And Taylor hold our banner up 
Way down in Mexico. 
But at this moment I 
awoke, 
As loud a 
bell did ring, 
And saw unto the breeze our Flag 
Its graceful emblem fling ! 
I 
saw old Independence Hall, 
So bright in the sun's ray, 
As Hancock to the people spoke, 
" 'Tis our Centennial Day !" 
And all the spirits of my dream 
Did join in joyful cry— 
This is the year of Seventy-Six— 
The Fourth day of July! 
And sweet Columbia, far above, 
She pointed down with pride 
Unto our Flag, and proudly said— 
" 
It has the world defied !"

Sweetest girl I

Her rosy cheeks do blush ; 
With her blue eyes and cunning, shy, 
She seems to say oh hush ! 
Her wealth of Ringlets flowing ! 
I 
watch her form of grace ; 
Like Cupid's dart she won my heart, 
This girl with an Angel face.

My love is the belle of the Avenue, 
She walks up and down ey'ry day ; 
And charms ev'ry one as she passes by, 
So beautiful, graceful and gay ; 
The swells, when they see her, go crazy ; 
And silently wish they were free 
To walk by her side, but they are denied, 
For she will have no one but me. ( Oh ! ) 
CHORUS. 
She is the belle of the Avenue, 
Graceful and bright, full of fairy light, 
Sweet and enchanting with eyes of blue, 
Beaming with love and glee ; 
She is the star of society, 
Pride of the ball with her fairy form. 
Joy and delight of her home so bright, 
And dearer thiCi life to me. 
Sometimes, when ifs fine in the afternoon. 
Her ma sends her out for a 
walk ; 
" 
Now, darling," she'll say, " don't be long away, 
Don't stand with the voting men to talk 
" 
0, ma!" sha replies, `• do not fear me— 
You know such a 
thing cannot be ;" 
Then smiling she goes in all her nice clothes, 
And waits on the corner for me. ( Ha ! ha !) 
She is the belle, etc. 
We walk and we talk of the latest balls, 
And view all the styles of the day; 
And when she must leave, oh ! yon can't efrnad 
How much I 
would wish her to stay; 
But she will return on the morrow, 
That is, if mamma will agree ; 
Ind while we're apart, I 
know in my heart, 
She's all the time wishing for me. (Ah!) 
She is the belle, etc.

Call me " thine own," natre fond endearing, 
Like music sweet it falls on mine ear ; 
Tells me of hope, life's pathway cheering. 
Whispers of home, with thee ever near ; 
Call me " thine own," doubt would destroy. 
For only thro' faith are we secure ; 
Making our hearts strong to endure 
What lies before us, sorrow or joy. 
'all me " thine own", thine, thine alone 7 
Name fond, endearing, call me " thine own.' 
Years may roll on, youth's dreams may leave us 
Hopes faint and die that lighted our way ; 
Trials may come, sorrows may grieve us, 
Friends may depart r 
falsely betray ; 
Call me " thine own," all else may fail, 
With love in our hearts, Heaven still remains 
Each bond, with time fresh vigor gains, 
And o'er life's tempests love shall prevail. 
Call me " thine own," thine, thine alone. 
Name most endearing, call me " thine own.''

JOHN DOBBS was tickled when a 
child, 
By a 
nurse who drove him almost wild, 
And Johnny laugh'd he, he, he, 
And shook his little sides with glee; 
He laughed so long, he laughed so loud, 
The neighbors gathered in a 
crowd, 
They turned poor Johnny upside down, 
They poured cold water on his crown. 
They bit his fingers, pinched his oar, 
And tho' it -may seem very queer; 
lie still lanfthed on, and some folks say, 
He'll laugh until his dying day. 
Now John crrew up a 
fine young boy, 
Hi ,
-•• father's hope, his mother's joy. 
His smile was bland, his laugh was clear, 
His month it stretched from ear to ear; 
His nose turned up, his hair was brown, 
And John was known throughout the town, 
And if on him you turned your chaff, 
lie quite convuls'd you with his laue:11: 
A 
parson once the task essay'd, 
To make him grave and did upbraid. 
But Johnny made a 
wry grimace, 
And sent the parson from the place. 
When John went courting, people say, 
lie wont in such a 
funny way, 
He said, my dear, will you have me, 
And be my wife, he, he, he; 
The maid reply'd ho, ho, Ito, 
Well, John, yo t 
see I 
can't say no, 
And so they married very soon, 
And had a 
happy honey- moon, 
John laughs at Mary, so they say, 
And Mary tickles John all day, 
Tne more iie ickles John you zee, 
The inure he laugns he, he, he, 
And now this merry little pair, 
have children ten, but they don't care 
The children laugh just like their dad, 
They drove their pour old granny mad; 
And John he gave a 
loud gullaw. 
As he parted with his mother-in-law. 
For they laughed so much site could'ut 
But went to dis,aut parts away, 
And now this happy family, 
spend all their tithe in merry glee, 
And when lie itiLs some pc- pie doubt,

THE BEAUTIFUL SNOW, 
"r11 ,-, 
author found at itit—Ann RMIAN's Morunn Tsz-Lt:ur, 
Oil! the snow, the beautihil snow, 
Filling the sky and the earth beow; 
Over the house-tops, over the streets, 
Over the heads of the people you meet. 
Dancing, flirting, skimming slow?. 
Beautiful snow, it can do nothing wrong, 
Flying to kiss a 
fair lady's cheek; 
Clinging to lips in a 
frolicsome freak, 
Beautiful snow from heaven above. 
Pure as an angel, gentle as love. 
Oh ! the snow, the beautiful snow. 
how the flakes gather and laugh as they go, 
Whirling about in their maddening fun, 
It plays in its glee wdh every one--
Chasing, laughing, hurrying by. 
It lights on the face and it sparkles the eye, 
And the dogs with a 
bark and a 
hound, 
nap at the crystals that eddy around; 
The town is alive and its heart in aglow, 
To welcome the coming of the beautiful snow. 
How wildly the crowd goes swaying along, 
Flailing each other with humor and song; 
!tow the gay sledges like ineeors flash by. 
Bright for a 
moment, then lost to the eye ! 
Ringing, swinging, dashing they go. 
Over the crust of the beautiful snow— 
.- now so pure when it falls from the sky, 
As to make one regret to see it lie, 
To be trampled and tracked by the thousands of feet ; 
Till it blends w:th the filth in the horrible street. 
Once 
was as pure as the sno 
but 
fell; 
Fell like the snowdlakes from :•.eaven to hell, 
Fel to be trampled as MC. '21 the street, 
Fell to be scoffed, tc be spit on and beat, 
Plea&-.(.,:, cursing, dreading to die. 
Se:ing my soul to whoever would buy. 
Dealing in shame for a 
morsel of bread, 
Hating the living and fearing the dean, 
Merciful God ! have I 
fallen so low ? 
And yet I 
was once like the beautiful snow . 
Once I 
was as fair as the beautiful snow. 
With an eye like a 
crystal a 
heart like its glow 
Once 1 
was loved for my innocent grace— 
Flattered and sought for the charms of my take. 
Father, mother, sister, alL 
God and myself I 
have lost by my fall, 
Th veriest wretch that goes shivering by, 
Will make a 
wide sweep lest I 
wander too nigh; 
For all that is on or above me I 
know, 
There's nothing as pure as the neautiful snow. 
How strange it should be, that this beautiful snow, 
Should fall on a 
sinner with nowhere to go ; 
llov strange should it be when night conies a ! Ain. 
If the snOW and the ice struck my desperate Li:alit. 
Fainting, freezing, dying alone. 
Too weak for prayer, too weak for a • man, 
To be heard in the streets of the • uzy ! own: 
Gone mad in the joy of the snow c,::.,11ig down; 
To be and to die in my terrible woe.

Kind friends give your attention, 
To please, is our intention ; 
So listen while we mention what occurred the other day, 
While we were wa:king down the street, 
A 
protV girl we chanced to meet ; 
To se her smile was such a 
treat, so bewitching and so gay, 
We both then raised our hats at once, 
For she hzd caught us with her glance, 
With such beauty we were entranced, this charming fairy 
Queen.

CHORUS. 
She's the sweetest girl we've seen, 
And her name is Emeline, 
And to win her we will try, 
And should she refuse us both, 
Then we will take an oath 
To live single ' till we die. 
We'll meet again this evening, 
When the shyer Moon is beaming. 
And the little stars are gleaming then we will tell our love. 
When we meet her after dirk, 
Then we stroll around the Park ; 
She thinks it such a 
jolly lark to win from us our love; 
And though we're rivals as you see, 
And she may love him and not love me, 
ill we find out we'll both agree, and win her if we can.

UNDER THE SEA. 
As gung, by TONY PASTOR. 
THE other night I 
went to bed, 
In fact, I 
often do, 
And in my sleep, went down to the deep, 
Where a 
strange world met my view ; 
This world was called Concordia, 
Itc: people gay and free, 
.1 wished that I 
were one of them, 
Fifty miles under the sea, 
CHORUS. 
This is what I 
saw when dreaming, 
As plain, as plain could be, 
They were oh so content, they never paid rent, 
Fifty miles under the sea. 
Their food and drink was pure, and not 
Adulterated stuff, 
They'd no Good Templars, for they knew 
When they'd just had enough. 
They'd no " blues," partial to running in, 
No Divorce Court had they got, 
And they never read " The tahrlisbman," 
0 they were a 
happy lot. 
CHORUS. 
This is what I 
saw when dreaming, 
As plain, as plain could lie 
They'd ne'er had an " Othr,er," no claimant" Sir Roger,', 
Fifty miles under the sea. 
4i4 
They'd never had a 
national debt, 
They never were troubled with wars. 
They never had a 
man for the rates 
Come knock, knock, knock at their doors; 
The toothache, income tax, and corns 
They knew not—happy souls! 
Of railway smashes they'd ne'er heard, 
Nor the price of a 
ton of coals. 
CHORUS. 
his is what I 
saw when dreaming, 
Am.plain, as plain could be,

A 
VOICE FROM THE OCEAN. 
By W . 
H. 
DF,LEHAVTT. 
It was meet in early childhood, 
To he rocked and hushed, " hushoe 
When an infant, screaming wild, would 
Soon fall sleeping, and lay low, 
But ' twas on a 
Mother's bosom. 
Softly, sweetly lulled to rest. 
Different, far, the raging Ocean— 
Cold and cheerless is its breast. 
But our Saviour—Great Omnipotent! 
Knoweth best the way to plan. 
On the Mother's breast the infant— 
On the Ocean's breast the man. 
Daring hearts are those who venture 
O'er the wild and treacherous Sea. 
Faithful hearts are those who rest sure 
In God's guidance, safe to be. 
Even here, sweet thoughts remind us 
Of old friends and kindred dear ; 
While we cast a 
look behind us, 
Gushes forth a 
kindly tear. 
We may never reach old England. 
Still, we hold bright hope in store. 
Angels guide us to the end, and 
We may reach a 
better shore.

When de shadow of de sun came peeping in; [bark, 
At night when all was dark, we would hear de watch-dog 
And we'd listen to de murmur of de wind. 
It seem to say to me, " You people must be free," 
For de happy time am coming, Lord be prais'd 
For then we would weep and moan, for our souls were not

ing a 
rare amusement for young ladies and gentlemen. Read what two 
leading New York papers say of it: 
The N. Y. Evening Mail writes' 
"A 
Little Book has lately appeared In print at Mr. A. J. Fumes's, 98 Nas-
sau street ca led the 
Little Flirt." We cannot say that we recommend 
it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, as we think it would only 
encourage the bad habit of " flirting." 
Unfortunately, there is enough 
of it done without any further necessity of explaining " how, when and 
where to do it." and this little volume would advise and initiate the un-
corrupted in practicing what is commonly called "flirting." 
'The N. Y. Eeening Telegram writes: " We have lately seen a 
neat little 
book, bound in Morocco leather, costing twenty-five cents, called the 
"Little Flirt," published by A. J. FISHES, No. 98 Nassau street. 
It 
gives information of the modus operandi of flirting, and of the meaning 
of every motion of the handkerchief, fan, glove and parasol. 
As there 
is nothing at all objectionable in the volume, and its contents might af-
ford some innocent amusement to many, we do not hesitate to recom-
mend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers." 
Elegantly bound in cloth, gilt 
Price 25 Cents. 
Lover's Telegrapit.—Containing Additional Signals for we 
in Flirtations not contained in the " Lillie Flirt." Window Telegraph-

Napoleon's Oraeuluni.—A Verbatim Copy of the Lon-
don edition (originally published at the price of $ 5.00), which professes

abided by, or been ruled by the answers of this Oracle. No further lib-
erties have been taken in ihe translation, than merely to adapt it to the 
usages of this country. 
The questions being snore numerous, and the 
the answers more diversified than any edition ever before published in
