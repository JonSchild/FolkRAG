DEXTER SMITH. 
The New York Season gives the following inter-
esting particulars concerning the recognized song-poet 
of America: 
We need make no apology for adding to our gal-
lery of portraits, the counterfeit presentment of the 
author of such a 
song as " Put me in my little bed." 
The words and sentiment of the felicitous melody are 
known all over our land, and have become popular 
across the sea, wherever the English language is spo-
ken. 
• 
Dexter Smith was born in Salem, Mass., in 1839 
His earlier literary efforts appeared in various maga-
zines and newspapers, and were particularly noticeable 
for their musical rhythm, simplicity, purity and cor-
rectness. 
It was not until " Ring the bell softly " was pub-
lished, however, that Dexter Smith became so widely 
known. 
This poem sprung into popularity at once, 
and was extensively quoted throughout the country, 
translated into foreign languages, and cited in Con-
gress by Hon. Mr. Ashley, Dec. 17th, 18GS, on the oc-
casion of the memorial services on the life and char-
acter of Thaddeus Stevens. 
Other popular poems followed in rapid succession, 
" 
Put me in my little bed "— a cradle song— being 
the author's last great " bit." 
The masses have no idea of the obstacles in the 
way of success in song- writing. 
Not more than one 
song in a 
thousand becomes popular, and very few 
more than pay the expense of publishing. 
DEXTER SMITH. 
The production of hundreds of would-be famous 
writers lie upon the shelves of the music-stores, un-
heard of by the general public. 
Dexter Smith's songs and poems are as popular 
abroad as at home, a 
statement which is assured by 
the fact that he has recently accepted several flatter-
ing offers from leading London publishers. 
Although Mr. Smith is thoroughly American in 
feeling, it must have been gratifying to him to have 
received a 
letter from Queen Victoria, dated at Buck-
ingham Palace, October 10th, 1870, expressing her 
approval of his poems, which it seems are familiar to 
the members of the royal family. 
A contemporary (The Phrenological Journal) consid-
ers Dexter Smith the " Hobert Burns of America." 
This is, indeed, high praise. 
In addition to Mr. Smith's numerous engage-
ments with music publishers, he is the editor of the 
leading musical monthly of Ndw England; corres-
pondent of the London Orche8tra; a 
contributor to 
several magazines ; correspondent of a 
dozen musical 
journals ; musical and dramatic critic, etc. 
These numerous and varied occupations make Mr. 
Smith one of the busiest of men ; in fact, a 
representa-
tive, pushing young American. 
With his musical and literary tastes, Mr. Smith 
combines that shrewd business tact and foresight which 
mark an enterprising, successful career. 
His 
paper 
furnishes 
abundant 
proof 
of 
his 
many and varied qualifications. 
He has achieved a 
fame and fortune remarkable for one so young, espe-
cially in his own country.

DEXTER SMITH'S LATEST POPULAR SONG. 
Now ' tis bed time, mother, darling, 
For the sun has gone to rest, 
And the wee birds now are sleeping, 
Safe within their downy nest; 
Little Fido, too, is weary, 
He has played with me all day, 
Down the lane and in the meadow, 
Where the mowers make the hay; 
Mother, have I 
been a 
good child? 
Tell me ere I 
go to sleep ; 
If I 
have, the holy angels 
Will o'er me their vigils keep. 
C110 Bus. 
Kiss me, mother, God will keep us 
Through the shadows of the night. 
And His hand shall softly lead us 
To the land of golden light; 
Now ' tis bed time, kiss me, mother, 
Kiss me, then I'll go to sleep, 
For I've asked the Lord to love us, 
And our poor souls now to keep. 
Now ' tis bed time, kiss me, mother, 
Ere 1 
say my evening prayer, 
Ere I 
close my eyes in slumber, - 
Free from every thought of care; 
Now I 
pray that God will keep me, 
Till the morning's sunny light; 
Mother, is not angel sister, 
In the heavenly home so bright ? 
Should He take my spirit upward, 
Ere the coming of the day, 
I 
shall meet with little Minnie, 
In the land so far away. (CnoRuS.) 
"Now I 
lay me—" say it, mother, 
Let me hear your gentle voice, 
It will soothe me to sweet slumber, 
It will make my heart rejoice ; 
Father loves me, in the morning 
He will take me on his knee; 
Mother, why does darling brother 
Stay so long upon the sea ? 
Kiss me, mother, God will keep us 
Through the shadows of the night, 
And his hand shall safely lead us 
To the land of golden light. 
cuonus. 
Kiss me, mother, God will keep us 
Through the shadows of the night, 
And His hand shall softly lead us 
To the land of golden light ; 
Now ' tis bed time, kiss me, mother, 
Kiss me, then I'll go to sleep, 
For I've asked the Lord to love us, 
And our poor souls now to keep.

Some one has gone from this strange world of ours, 
No more to gather its thorns with its flowers, 
No more to linger where sunbeams must fade, 
Where on all beauty death's fingers are laid ; 
Weary with mingling life's bitter and sweet, 
Weary with parting and never to meet, 
Some one has gone to the bright golden shore; 
Ring the bell softly, there's crape on the door. 
Weary with mingling life's bitter and sweet, 
Weary with parting and never to meet, 
Some one has gone to the bright golden shore, 
Ring the bell softly, there's crape on the door. 
Some one is restin ,,
,: 
from sorrow and sin, 
happy where earth's conflicts enter not in ; 
Joyous as birds, when the morning is bright, 
When the sweet sunbeams have brought us their light, 
Weary with sowing and never to reap, 
Weary with labor and welcoming sleep, 
Some one's departed to Heaven's glad shore; 
Ring the bell softly, there's crape on the door. 
Angels were anxiously longing to meet, 
One who walks with them in Heaven's bright street ; 
Loved ones have whispered that some one is blest, 
Fkee from earth's trials, and taking sweet rest; 
Yes ! there is one more in angelic bliss, 
One less to cherish, and one less to kiss, 
One more departed to Heaven's bright shore; 
Ring the bell sofily, there's crape on the door.

When the world is fast asleep, 
And the stars shine o'er the deep, 
And the winds roar wildly at their play, 
When the white- winged ships go by, 
When the sea runs mountain high, 
Then I 
think of Bell far down the bay. 
CHORUS—Riven hair and eyes of jet, 
Sparkling orbs, they haunt me yet, 
has the maiden of the dashing spray; 
Yes, let me go. where I 
will, 
I 
am thinking of her still, 
Bell, the lighthouse girl of Boston bay. 
Amid the ocean's fitful damps, 
Sits she there and trims the lamps, 
As a 
beacon to the stmln-tossed bark ; 
And she fears not wind nor tide, 
For her duty is her pride, 
And she sits and sings like any lark. (Cno.) 
There's a 
sailor far away 
From the lights of Boston bay, 
She has promised to become his bride 
And when he returns again, 
To his home far o'er the main, 
He will have the maiden by his side. 
Cnonns— Raven hair and eyes of jet, 
Sparkling orbs that haunt me yet, 
Has the maiden of the dashing spray; 
Yes, let me go where I 
will,

Bell, the lighthouse girl of Boston bay, 
Put Me in my Little Bed..

Oh, birdie, I 
am tired now,

You've sung your happy songs all day, 
Now put your head beneath your wing.

I 
want to lay me down and rest: 
So, put me in my little bed.

Come, sister, come, kiss me gootl-nigbt, 
For I 
my evening prayer have said; 
I'm tired now., and sleepy too: 
Come, put me in my little bed. 
Oh, sister, what did mother say, 
When she was called to heaven away? 
She told me always to be good, 
And never, never go astray; 
I 
can't forget the day she died— 
She placed her band upon my head, 
She whispered softly, " Keep my child—" 
And then they ' told me she was dead I (Cno.) 
Dear sister, come and bear my prayer, 
Now, ere I 
lay me down to sleep, 
Within my Heavenly Father's care, 
While angels bright their vigils keep; 
And let me ask of Him above, 
To keep my soul in paths of right— 
Oh, let me thank Him for his love, 
Ere I 
shall say my last good-night I (Cno.)

One sultry summer morning, 
A. year ago, or past, 
We met beneath an awning, 
When it was raining fast 3 
She looked so very sweetly, 
As never had hiss before, 
I 
was in love completely. 
Before the rain was o'er.

She looked so very sweetly, 
As never had lass before; 
I was in love completely, 
Before the rain was o'er. 
I 
said ' twas " quite a 
shower," 
" ' Tis so," the lass replied, 
And for a 
full half-hour, 
We chatted, side by side; 
I 
found I 
knew her brother, 
And she had heard of mine, 
Arid then somehow or other, 
She asked me home to dine. (Cno.) 
Soon after, we were married, 
And settled down in life, 
And I 
have often tarried, 
Where first I 
met my wife ; 
And though life's pleasant morning 
Has dawned on us again, 
I'll never forget the awning, 
Nor that sweet summer rain.

How happily- the moments pass. 
From dewy morn till night, 
While we behold in fortune's glass, 
Sweet pictures of delight; 
Two loving hearts one there may see, 
Beneath a 
cloudless sky, 
Perhaps those loving ones may be 
My little wife and I. 
Perhaps those loving ones may be 
My little wife and I. 
No sorrow comes to cloud our lot, 
Or cast its shadow here, 
And every trouble is forgot, 
While one we love is near; 
There is no harsh or cruel word, 
There is no saddened sigh, 
We never have but kindness heard, 
My little wife and I. 
We never have but kindness heard, 
My little wife and I. 
We know that some day we must part, 
When death shall come between. 
When one poor tried and trusting heart 
Alone on faith must lean ; 
But we shall part to meet again, 
Beyond earth's clouded sky, 
Beyond earth's sunshine and its rain, 
My little wife and I. 
Beyond earth's sunshine and its rain,

There's a 
pair of little hands,

Death has sealed two little eyes,

Little baby's gone to sleep. 
Tiny windows of the soul, - 
Little baby's gone to sleep. 
There's another bud removed, - 
Ere it felt the blight of sin ; 
Through the door the angels made, 
Darling baby has passed in. 
Far beyond the azure skies, 
Where the tiny star- eyes peep, 
From all earth's sad doubts and fears, 
Little baby's gone to sleep. 
From all earth's sad doubts and fears, 
Little baby's gone to sleep. 
She will make in fairer land, 
Where the angel voices sing ; 
There the floweret shall expand, 
There shall love perfection bring. 
She has reached the golden shore, 
Through the river, cold and deep,_ 
Angels bore her safely there, 
Baby's only gone to sleep.

When I 
Went Courting Sallie!

One clear, cold night, the stars shone bright, 
I 
think twas in December, 
And on the snow the moon's sweet glow 
Gleamed like a 
flickering ember; 
The air was still, o'er mead and hill, 
And hushed each brook and valley, 
When to the town I 
sauntered downy 
To call on lovely Sallie. 
CHORUS. 
Sweet Sallie Grey, I 
bless the day 
I 
met thee in the valley, 
And never yet did I 
regret 
That I 
went courting Sallie. 
Tears swiftly rolled their heat and cold, 
Their fair and cloudy weather, 
And there were two fond beans and true, 
That smiled and wept together; 
So one fair night, when skies were bright, 
I 
thought I 
would not daily, 
My heart went " thump," while I 
asked, plump 
If she would be my Sallie. (Cnotaus.) 
Long years have flown, we're older grown, 
An I 
silver flecks her tresses, 
Since she, a 
bride, stood by my side, 
And now my way she blesses; 
We pass through life, its joy and strife, 
Toward death's dreary valley, 
And never yet did I 
regret 
That I 
went courting Sallie. (Cnonns.)

There's a 
boy without a 
mother, 
homeless in the streets to rove, 
Ne'er a 
father, sister, brother, 
To surround his path with love; 
Speak a 
kind word to the orphan, 
Take him gently by the hand, 
Tell him of the paths supernal, 
Leading to the golden land. 
Save the boy! save the boy ! 
Hear the mother's cry so sweet; 
Save the boy, the precious boy, 
Wandering in the city street. 
'Tis long since he felt the pressure 
Of a 
mother's loving kiss, 
When she left a 
world of sorrow, 
Changing earth-life such as this, 
For a 
land of bliss immortal, 
For a 
sweet home full of joy, 
Leaving to the care of strangers, 
Her beloved, darling boy. 
(
Cnonts.) 
Lead him from the world's temptations, 
To a 
home within your heart, 
That from ways of truth and virtue, 
He may ne'er be called to part; 
And his mother's spirit watching, 
From her home above the skies, 
Will bestow the richest blessings, 
Sweet foretaste of paradise. (Cnonus.)

In the realm beyond the stars, 
Past the gate which death unbars, 
Dwells the dear, happy angel of our love; 
Clad in robes of spotless white, 
Chanting praises day and night, 
In the glad home of angels sweet above; 
how our hearts with anguish burned, 
When our darling we returned 
To the Hand that had blest our lot awhile; 
Oh, her gentle, winning ways, 
Were as sweet as autumn days, 
And we never can forget her loving smile. 
CHORUS. 
She is waiting, 
She is waiting, 
She is waiting, yes, she's waiting for us there; 
In the realm beyond the stars, 
Past the gate which death unbars, 
She is waiting, yes, waiting for us there. 
Oh 1 
her days were like a 
gleam 
Of glad sunshine o'er life's stream, 
And they passed like a 
brief and cloudless day; 
And her spirit took its flight, 
At the coining of the night, 
To the sweet land of angels far away; 
Yes we hope to meet her there, 
'Tis the burden of our prayer, 
That when stern death shall claim us for his own; 
That we once again may meet, 
In her home supernal sweet, 
'Twill cheer us, though we walk through life alone.

Put away the little dresses, 
That the darling used to wear, 
She will need them on earth never, 
She has climbed the golden stair; 
She is with the happy angels, 
And I 
long for her sweet kiss, 
Where the little feet are waiting, 
In the realms of perfect bliss. 
CHORUS. 
Angels whisper that our darling 
Is in lands of love so fair, 
That her little feet ara waiting 
Close beside the golden stair. 
Lay aside her little playthings, 
Wet with mother's pearly tears, 
how we shall miss little Nelly, 
All the coming, weary years! 
Fold the dainty little dresses, 
That she never more will wear, 
For her little feet are watiting, 
Up above the golden stair. (Cno.) 
Kiss the little curly tresses, 
Cut from her bright golden hair, 
Do the angels kiss our darling 
In the realm so bright *and fair ? 
Oh! we pray to meet our darling, 
For a 
long, long sweet embrace, 
Where the little feet are waiting, 
And we meet her face to face. (Cno.)

When the day was growing late, 
Willie met me at the gate, 
Ere the stars came to twinkle in the sky, 
Ere the nightingale was heard, 
Or the evening zephyrs stirred, 
Where the brooklet sung sweet songs as it ran by; 
But no song so sweet to me, 
• 
As my Willie's voice can be, 
When he whispers, " Meet me, Josie, at the gate," 
So I 
gladly met him there, 
Where the roses bloomed so fair, 
When the day was so quickly growing late. 
CHOutis—There's no song so sweet to me, 
As my Willie's voice can be, 
When he says, " Meet me, Josie, at the gate," 
So I 
gladly met him there, 
Where the roses bloomed so fair, 
When the day was so quickly growing Lite. 
Willie now is far away, 
And alone I 
often stray, 
To the gate where we parted that sweet hour, 
Yet I 
know his heart is true, 
As the sunshine and the dew, 
To the petals of the fragrant summer flower 
As he whispered in my ear, 
Something sweet for me to hear, 
I 
was glad I 
was asked his bride to be, 
Though I 
did not whisper " yea," 
Still I 
did not answer " nay," 
For my thoughts in my face he sure could see. 
The Little One that Died.

In our dreams we often hear, 
Sweetest voices soft and clear, 
Gently whispering of the little one that died, 
Of our darling angel child, 
happy little Mabel Wilde, 
Now at rest where no sorrow may betide; 
Angels guard, protect and bless, 
Cherish thee with tenderness, 
Till we meet at heaven's portal, Mabel Wilde ; 
• Oh ! we ever love to think, 
That we soon shall reach life's brink, 
That we're nearing thee and heaven, angel child. 
CHORUS. 
In our dreams we often hear, 
Sweetest voices soft and clear, 
Gently whispering, gently whispering, 
Of the little one that died: 
As we wander day by day, 
O'er life's weary, fruitless way, 
Angel voices seem to murmur in our ear; 
Do not feel that she is dead, 
Though she was by death's hand led, 
Happy is thy little darling, do not fear; 
Then the clouds and shadows fade, 
And the future seems arrayed, 
With a 
promise, o'er which happy visions smiled, 
That when life's sad dream is o'er, 
On the great eternal shore, 
We shall greet our little darling, Mabel Wilde.

Oh! bring back my childhood again with its joy, 
When life was a 
garden of sunshine and flowers, 
As softly it glided when I 
was a 
boy, 
And happiness dwelt in the swift-passing hours; 
How vividly now one fond picture appears, 
Engraven by time on 
page of the mind, 
And once more it seems as in life's sunny years, 
I'm holding the skein for my grandma to wind. 
I'm standing again by my grandmother's side, 
As often I 
stood in the sweet days of yore, 
And through the quaint window the bright sun-
beams glide, 
And dance with delight on the white sanded floor; 
My schoolfellows, weary of waiting for me, 
Are beckoning and calling for me, but in vain, 
Till at length from tired arms the last band is free, 
And grandma has wound up the whole of the skein. 
The sunlight that streamed through the small win-
dow pane, 
Illumed the old room with its bright cheerful beams, 
And fell on the form which for long years has lain, 
Where green willows wave, and the summer day 
dreams; 
She told me .of life, which oft tangled and rough, 
That throughout its strands many knots I 
should 
find, 
That might be unraveled with patience enough, 
While holding life's skein for the future to wind.

Lady, come, my boat is waiting, 
Where the morn its sweetness tells; 
Come, and soon we shall be sailing, 
Down among the lily- bells; 
Like bright stars upon the water, 
Sweetly, peacefully tliey gleam, 
Let us steal upon their slumber, 
Wake them from their happy dream. 
CHORUS. 
Lady, come, my boat is waiting, 
-Where the morn its sweetness tells, 
Come, and soon we shall be sailing, 
Down among the lily-bells. 
I 
will cull the fairest flower, 
Front the lakelet's cold embrace, 
And amid thy raven tresses, 
That pure emblem I 
will place ; 
Type of love, so sweet and holy, 
Blooming beautiful and bright, 
Though ingulfed in life's dark waters, 
Cast in sorrow's deepest night. (Cuo.) 
Come, my bride, my boat is waiting, 
O'er the waters we will glide, 
We will dream . of bygone moments, 
As we drift upon the tide ; 
And, perhaps thou wilt remember, 
If thy memory rightly tells, 
When a 
lass gave me her promise, 
Down among the lily-bells. (Ctuntrs.)

Where the bright sunny rays of the swixt summer 
days 
O'er the meadow at noontide are beaming, 
Where the soft, balmy breeze chants a 
song through 
the trees, 
And the birds through the long days are dreaming; 
Where the meadow's rich bloom sheds a 
sweet, sweet 
perfume, 
And the daisy in beauty reposes, 
Where the clover-heads wave o'er a 
grass-covered 
grave, 
Sleeps our darling one under the roses. 
She sleeps, an angel now, where death true life dis-
closes, 
Yes! angels bore our fair one home, where bloom 
eternal roses. 
There is sadness and grief that her life was so brief, 
That she faded in life's early morning, 
Yet she dwells where the blest take their sweet final 
rest, 
Where the joys of a 
new life are dawning. 
Oh I 
we tnis her sweet smile, that the hours would 
beguile. 
When the long weary day dawns and closes, 
And our sad hearts lie there, with our darling so fair, 
With our darling one under the roses. (Cno.).

Beautiful in form and feature, 
He's a 
crafty little creature, 
Yet I 
do not fear his art; 
For I've seen his base deceiving, 
Till I 
now am unbelieving, 
In the archer of the heart. 
You may tell me of his graces, 
Pretty words and smiling faces, 
lie is acting but his part; 
Heedless of the hearts he's hurting, 
He will say he's " only flirting," 
Wicked archer of the heart. 
When he sets nice young men sighing, 
And they vow for me they're dying, 
Cupid plays a 
wicked part ; 
Though I 
do not wish to grieve them, 
Yet I 
really can't believe them, 
Can I, archer of the heart. 
Though the chances are but narrow, 
Sometimes he will send his arrow, 
Binding hearts that were apart, 
Into one sweet, loving union, 
Dwelling in a 
glad communion, 
Little archer of the heart. 
So until I 
thus can marry, 
Why I 
think I'd better tarry, 
And defy the boy-god's dart; 
You may call me dull and stupid, 
Yet I 
don't believe in Cupid, 
Fickle archer of the heart.

"That little church around the corner," 
How dear to me the spot! 
And though far o'er the earth I 
wander, 
It neer can be forgot. 
'Twos there in childhood's days I 
listened, 
To the songs I 
loved so well, 
And there I 
learned of God and heaven, 
Where holy angels ever dwell. 
CHORUS. 
The sun may shine, the clouds may darken, 
No gloom this life can cast, 
That little church around the corner, 
Will take me home at last. 
Alas I 
the days that were so sunny, 
Have slowly passed away, 
And clouds have gathered o'er my pathway, 
Old friends no longer stay ; 
Yet still I 
hear the sweet birds singing, 
'Round above the old church door, 
And holy hymns glad thoughts are bringing, 
To cheer my heart forevermore! 
I 
care not how the world may darken, 
Or earthly friends prove cold, 
I 
know there is a 
future for me, 
Within my Father's fold ; 
And when my soul shall leave its casket, 
Free from all life's sun or storm, 
That little church around the corner 
Shall welcome home my mortal form.

Oh I 
years that have flown with thy pleasure and sad-
• ness, 
flow sweet are the memories I 
cherish of thee 
As out of the depths of thy sorrow and gladness, 
The haunts of my childhood in fancy I 
see; 
The cot in the valley, the broad silver river, 
The schoolhouse that stood beneath the far-spread-
ing tree, 
These scenes in my memory will linger forever, 
Although far removed from the spot I 
may be. 
The schoolhouse is standing where first I 
beheld it, 
Now old, weather-beaten and mossy with age, 
And there is the bench where I 
first learned the les-
sons 
That cluster so thickly on youth's glowing page; 
The schoolmates that gathered at call of the teacher, 
Again I 
behold in the old, happy place, 
I 
hear their sweet voices in glad chorus ringing, 
I 
see the bright smile on each young, eager face. 
! 
where are those schoolmates? all scattered for-
ever I 
The voice of the teacher is heeded no more, 
And some have passed over the beautiful river, 
To meet the great Teacher on heaven's bright 
shore; 
And may those still learning the world's changeful 
lessons, 
When all of the scenes of life's sad school are past, 
Be gathered together in realms that are fairer, 
In one sweet vacation forever to last. 
Mollie's Welcome to Pat Malloy,

Oh I 
Patrick, dear, I'm glad to hear you love me still 
the same, 
You left me long, long years ago, but you were not 
to blame; 
'Twas poverty that drove you forth from your old 
cabin home; 
And much I 
grieved that you must go, among strange 
lands to roam, 
I 
know that you have thought of me, wherever you 
have been, 
And of our dear old country, our hills and vales so 
green, 
And I'll be glad to welcome you, my * rue heart's 
only soy, 
I 
know that you will love me while your name is 
Pat -
Malloy. 
No matter how poor you have been, bow poor -
yoti 
now may be, 
For you've a 
heart that's rich with love, and that's 
enough for me. 
I 
care not for the hoarded wealth that misers may 
possess, 
It can not purchase earthly love, nor buy our happi-
ness; 
We'll walk life's road together, Pat, forever hand in 
hand, 
A happier pair you will not find, throughout our own 
fair land.. 
32 
Remember that while time shall last, you're still my 
own clear boy, 
And may no changes take from me the love of Pat 
Malloy. 
Your mother, Pat, has passed away to brighter 
realms than this, 
But, ere she died, I 
took her hand, and felt her dy-
ing kiss, 
Her last words were of you, my love, and whispered 
soft and low, 
She left her blessing for the lad who cheered her 
life below; 
" 
Tell Pat," said she, while tear-drops rolled adown 
her whitening cheek, 
" 
I 
waited for his coming with a 
hope I 
could not 
speak, 
But we shall sometime meet again, in scenes of love 
and joy, 
And until then, oh Mollie, dear, be true to Pat Mal-
loy."

When farewells were spoke; 
I 
left the dear spot, 
And as I 
departed, 
gazed on the cot, 
The home of my childhood; 
And turning once more, 
I 
plucked some sweet roses, 
That bloomed by the door. 
CHORUS. 
That bloomed by the door, 
That bloomed by the door, 
I 
plucked some sweet roses 
That bloomed by the dom.. 
Now, home and its pleasures 
Are left far behind, 
And naught but sweet momories 
Their bright spell cloth bind; 
I 
sigh for the dear ones, 
And fair scenes of yore, 
And gaze .on the roses 
That bloomed by the door. (Cuonus.) 
I've Irathered the flowers 
Of fair, sunny climes, 
Yet childhood's sweet echoes 
Still mingle their chimes; 
Though fortune its blessings 
-Upon me may pour, 
I 
cherish the roses 
That bloomed by the door. (Cnonus.) 
The petals have faded 
And lost their perfume, 
Yet memory endows them 
With fragrance and bloom ; 
And hope is e'er smiling, 
With greetings in store, 
With dear ones, where roses 
Shall bloom by the door. (Cnonus.)

She's sitting by the window, 
And looking on the sea, 
Iler hands are folded idly, 
She sees not you nor me. 
She crones a 
queer old ballad, 
"Alt ! can my love be dead," 
And stilt she sits and gazes, 
The flower of Marblehead. 
I 
can not well remember, 
The day her lover sailed, 
He was a 
brave, strong fellow, 
Who for no foeman quailed; 
She was a 
wondrous beauty, 
" 
A handsome pair," they said, 
And wished her happy future, 
The flower of Marblehead. 
The good ship left the harbor, 
One beautiful Spring day, 
And though ' tis twenty years since, 
It never came this way 
The rays from hope's sweet beacon, 
Are yet around her shed, 
And still she waits his coming, 
The flower of Marblehead. 
And when returning sailors, 
Come up the little bay, 
She asks " Have you seen Jamie," 
They answer sadly " Nay."

She crones a 
queer old ballad, 
." Ali, can my love be dead;" 
And still she sits and gazes, 
The flower of Marblehead.

Oh! beautiful _ sunset ! bow radiantly bright, 
_See where the twilight is wedding the night ; 
Beautiful altar, splendor untold, 
Curtains of crimson and silver and gold; 
Ohl proudly the sunbeam is wearing his crest, 
While going to welcome his bride from the West! 
Look where the mist-cloud is vailing the trees, 
While a 
sweet anthem is sung by the breeze. 
Oh ! beautiful rainbow, now hanging on high, 
Crescent of colors that vie with the skie ; 
Beautiful promise spanning the dome, 
Giving the sun-orb good speed to his home ; 
Now _softly the twilight leans down through the mist, 
Leans down -o'er the flowers the shower has kissed, 
Over the lake, which, with tremulous glow, 
Mirrors the sunbeams, which swing to and fro! 
Oh! beautiful sunset! the last breath of day 
Softly the features of light pass away; 
Soon shall the starlight come with its gleam, 
Gilding the earth like a 
soft fairy dream ; 
Oh I 
thus may life's sunset be sweetly serene, 
When we shall look backward o'er life's final scene, 
Prelude of joys that shall gladden our sight, 
After life's sunset and after life's night!

I 
have heard its dulcet song, 
Heard its sweet, unceasing strain, 
As the brooklet ran along 
On its way toward the main; 
And I 
think of childhood's days, 
When I 
wandered by its side, 
Listening to the merry lays 
Rippling on its silvery tide. 
Now I 
wander once again 
On its margin, soft and green, 
And I 
roam o'er memory's plain, 
Thinking of what might have been; 
Sing, sweet rivulet, thy song, 
Flowing onward to the sea, 
To the past thy strains belong, 
Yet the change is all in me.

Did I 
not gaze, sweet star, on thee ; 
When somber clouds obscure the light, 
And all is wrapped in shades of night, 
My eyes can pierce the gloom around, 
Until thy radiant beams are found. 
When fades the light of friendship's smile, 
When love and faith no more beguile, 
And o'er the earth we blindly grope, 
How welcome is thy light, sweet hope ! 
A foretaste of the realm divine, 
Is given forth by rays of thine ; 
Shine on, sweet star, above my way, 
And guide me to the perfect day.

I 
wandered where the roses red 
A sweet and lasting perfume shed, 
Where lay the violets peeping through, 
The green grass, with their eyes of blue; 
While over all, the birds of spring, 
Were softly, sweetly caroling ; 
Their music fell upon my ear, 
And warmed my heart with precious cheer. 
Tral Is, tral In, tral la, 
Tral la, tral la, tral In. 
$ 
But redder than the roses' hue, 
More azure than the violets' blue, 
Were cheeks and eyes of one I 
loved, 
Who through the valley with me roved; 
And sweeter than the robin's song, 
Her warbling as we passed along, 
This little maiden by my side, 
Who smiled the words her lips denied. 
Tral la, tral in, tral la, etc. 
As down life's valley, hand in hand, 
We go to reach life's final strand, 
Where death's deep ocean gathers up 
The joys and sorrows of earth's cup; 
Her smile shall every pleasure bless, 
Her voice will sing our happiness, 
And though her smiles shall speak alone,

There's a 
lass of beauty rare, 
With blue eyes and golden hair, 
One who meets me often in the shady lane; 
And she loves me well I 
know, 
Though she's never told me so, 
And 
.I 
know I 
dearly love sweet Kate O'Shane; 
There's a 
charm about the girl, 
More than dainty eye or curl ; 
More than all that lovers fancy may beguile ; 
'Tis a 
good and loving heart, 
That from me will never part, 
I 
can read it in her happy, truthful smile. 
CHORUS. 
There's a

'Though site's never told me so, 
And I 
know I 
dearly love sweet Kate O'Shane. 
Come there sunshine or come storm, 
There's a 
gentle fairy form, 
That will ever cheer life's path as forth we go ; 
Come there sadness or come joy, 
There's -a 
peace without alloy, 
For the hearts that ever trust each other so; 
Those blue eyes may gently fade, 
As we go down earth's fair glade, 
And the soft hair lose its tint of brightest gold, 
Yet along life's varied strand, 
As we wander hand in hand, 
We shall never, never let our hearts grow cold.

A 
little wanderer am T, 
No pleasant home beneath the shy, 
And if no kind friend shelters me, 
Must lay me down at once to die ; 
The snow is drifting o'er my path, . 
The cold and piercing winds benumb, 
And I 
shall starve for I 
have not 
Of bread to eat a 
single crumb. 
CII0RUS. 
Oh ! think of your own darling child, 
And pity, yes, pity, oh ! pity 
One who roams the wild. 
Oh ! think of one who does not know 
A 
father's care, a 
mother's love, 
Whose lot is bitterness and woe, 
-Where'er on earth I 
chance to rove ; 
But there is One who hears my cry, 
Who listens to the orphan's call, 
He surely will not let me die, 
Who heedeth even the sparrow's fall. 
Oh ! stranger, do not turn aside, 
When you my humble prayer have heard, 
But cheer the little orphan's heart, 
With kindly deed and gentle word ; 
And you will not regret the thought, 
You gave to wanderers such as we, 
When you shall hear those blessed words, 
That " Ye have done it unto me."

A. gay, dashing lover, 
I've roamed the world over, 
In search of a 
true, faithful wife, 
But vainly I've sought her, 
For no charming daughter 
I've yet found to brighten my life. 
I 
went o'er the ocean, 
Awl caused a 
commotion 
Among the fair damsels of France ; 
But no mademoiselle 
Seemed to suit very well, 
And Cupid made no great advance. 
I 
traveled again, 
Through England and Spain, 
And visited every grand mart, 
But donnas nor ladies, 
Their love (I'm afraid) is 
Not such as I 
want for my heart; 
I 
want a 
fair maiden, 
With graces well laden, 
With love beaming forth from her eyes, 
With step like a 
fairy, 
So queenly and airy, 
Oh ! such a 
wife I 
should well prize. 
Perchance I 
may find, 
. That very rare kind 
Among you, where beauties abound 
So show me your faces, 
Ye bashful young graces, 
While I 
for a 
choice look around! 
Alas! such dear creatures, 
With heavenly features, 
I 
never beheld in my life; 
But out of so many, 
'Tis hard to choose any, 
Though fondly I 
sigh for a 
wife.

Let me breathe my mother's name, 
Ere my spirit takes its flight, 
Ere they lay this mortal frame, 
Evermore from earthly sight; 
Let me dream of home again, 
Let me gaze on happy scenes, 
Where I 
mingled joy and pain, 
Ere death's river intervenes, 
elionts. 
Let me breathe my mother's name, 
Ere my spirit takes its flight, 
Ere they lay this mortal frame, 
Evermore from earthly sight. 
Let me see my mother's smile, 
Ere I 
take my last farewell, 
'Twill the weary hours beguile, 
And a 
lasting pleasure tell ; 
Oh, I 
dream of heaven now, 
With a 
spirit pure and bright, 
Mother's kiss has pressed my brow, 
And I 
pass to realms of light" ( Cno.)

We've " Mother I've come borne to die I" 
And " Mother the battle is o'er I" 
" 
Mother if I 
laid wings I 
could fly I" 
And now we don't want any more; 
The " Mothers " have long had the track, 
And led off the first in the dance, 
But now they must " kinder " stand back, 
And give the old man a 
chance.. 
CHORUS. 
Yes, do give the old man a 
chalice, 
Give him a 
chance, 
Yes, yes give the old man a 
chance, 
Give the old man a 
chance. 
There's " Mother, I 
think it will rain," 
And " Mother I 
wish I 
was rich," 
And " Mother I'm soft in the brain," 
And " Mother, my coat needs a 
stitch ;" 
Why don't they sing- some of their " dad," 
And let him once " tilt a 
lance," 
I 
think it is almost too had 
Not to give the old man a 
fair chance. (Cno.) 
There's " Mother will greet me" again,. 
I 
guess that 
the " Father " will, too, 
They've snubbed the old fellow, ' tis plain, 
It must make him feel rather blue ; 
Write " Father, musketoes w 
ill bite," 
Or, " Father I'm going to France," 
But don't always give him a 
slight, 
Do give the old man a 
fair chance.. (Cno) 
Just think what a 
world this would be, 
If " Fathers" should take the back seat, 
" 
Woman's rights," like waves of the sea, 
Would deluge our country complete; 
Their fashions would ruin our purse, 
Don't let their queer notions advance, 
I'm sure you'll make matters much worse 
If the " Fathers " don't get a 
fair chance.

We'll take a

Down in the starlight dell, 
Where we have strolled so oft before, 
We know the path quite well ; 
I've something I

A whisper you may heed, 
My fortune is all gone, Willie, 
I'm penniless indeed. 
But what is that to you, Willie, 
If my heart still is true, 
You still may praise my " golden hair," 
My " eyes so soft and blue." 
Is all your fortune gone, Maggie? 
Your lands and money, too, 
My fortune, large enough for me, 
Is scarce enough for two ; 
Don't take a 
grief to heart, Maggie, 
If, when I 
come this way 
To-morrow, at the twilight hour, 
I 
walk with Bessie Gray; 
And I

say to you, Maggie, 
I 
shall not keep my vow, 
A lady „should not seek to woo, 
I 
can not wed you now. 
" 
A lady should not woo," Willie, 
Nor should a 
lover win, 
Who seeks a 
maiden's gold alone. 
I 
hold your love a 
sin; 
Your false words shall not break the heart, 
That loved you so before ; 
If you my fortune came to win, 
I 
care for you no more; 
My fortune I 
have still, Willie, 
My lands and gold remain, 
But confidence in man's false words 
I 
never shall have again.

The heroes of our Northern land, 
Where snow-clad mountains rise, 
Where fair scenes smile on every hand, 
Beneath our clear, blue skies, 
Marched forth to meet our country's foes, 
When duty sent its plea, 
And where the sweet magnolia grows, 
They died for you and me. 
CHORUS,. 
They stayed not, though the light of home 
Gleamed with alluring light, 
But where war's terrors cast their gloom, 
They battled for the right; 
And when fair peace had crowned our land 
With sweetest liberty, 
We mourned the absence of the band 
Who died for you and me. 
Now peace and plenty fold their wings 
Above our Union shield; 
To living heroes memory brings 
Scenes from the battle-field; 
And while we honor those who yet 
Dwell beneath our banner free, 
The brave men we can not forget, 
Who died for you and me. (Cnonts.)

I climb the frowning rock again, 
Where, oft in days my childhood knew, 
I 
watched the white ships on the main, 
The clouds that drifted o'er the blue; 
flow bright the dreams that came to me, 
how sweet the songs that fancy sung, 
As on the old cliff by the sea 
The pearls of ocean were unstrung. 
The dreams have faded one by one, 
The songs have sadly died away, 
I 
see naught but the setting sun, 
Hear but the music of the spray. 
Thus after long and clouded years, 
Along the rocky cliff I 
range, 
The same old scene around appears, 
how sad that hearts alone must change !

Oh! I

If I

Some one is sure to be 
Within the little parlor, 
Where they can hear and see 
She has a 
roguish brother, 
With such a 
keen, black eye, 
Some one may black the other, 
When no one else is by. 
She smiles so very sweetly, 
When ever I 
meet her now, 
That I 
am sure she could not 
Refuse to hear my vow; 
I'll tell her that I 
love her, 
And shall until I 
die, 
If I 
can only see her, 
When no one else is by. (Crro.)

No matter though it rains or shines, 
I 
do not care a 
pin, - 
I 
never grumble o'er my lot, 
I 
think it is a 
sin; 
To cheer the heart and make you laugh, 
I 
always gladly .snive, 
I 
know you'll always welcome me, 
The jolliest boy alive 1 
cutouts. 
Old folks, young folks, listen to my ditty, 
If you can't smile you deserve my pity, 
To cheer the heart and make you laugh, 
I 
always gladly strive, 
I 
know you'll always welcome me, 
The jolliest boy alive 
I 
like to hear a 
funny song, 
Providing it is nice, 
And if they sing it very well, 
I 
make them do it twice ; 
Good dances, also, I 
admire, 
As sure as you're alive, 
Oh 1 
I'm a 
happy juvenile, 
The jolliest boy alive (Cutouts.) 
The girls are all in love with me, 
Deny it if you can, 
You must allow they much prefer 
To wed a 
happy man; 
To old or young I'm just the same, 
And if hard times arrive, 
I 
laugh them off, ha I 
ha! I 
am, 
The jolliest boy alive! (Cnout 
s.) 
What use is it to fret and scold, 
It doesn't change a 
thread, • 
If you are born with coal- black hair, 
You can not make it red ; 
There is no limit to your wants, 
If once you let them drive, 
'You'd better take it cool, like me, 
The jolliest boy alive (Cnonts.) 
If ever I 
get married, and 
I 
hardly think I 
shall, 
I'll marry no one for my wife, 
Except a 
happy " gal ;" 
If I 
should get a 
scolding wife, 
I 
should no longer thrive, 
No longer should I 
be, my friends,

'Twas many and many a 
year ago 
That young Edward came wooing me, 
But I 
told him I 
could not give ear to him, 
For my lover was o'er the sea; 
My heart was near breaking when Jamie left, 
To be gone for many a 
day, 
And though I 
was kind to young Edward Lane, 
Yet I 
could not but answer " nay." 
So I 
told him my husband he never could be, 
For I 
knew that James would come back to me, 
So I 
told him my husband he never could be, 
For my love,_my love would come back to me. 
The roses have bloomed and the snows have come, 
Yet my sailor boy comes not back, 
I 
have lived through long years with their smiles and 
tears, 
But I've ever been true to Jack ; 
c.,

I 
sit at my window and gaze afar, 
r1111 my poor eyes grow weak and dim, 
Yet never a 
sailor conies back to port, 
That can bring me a

I 
tell Edward my husband lie never can be, 
For I 
know that James will come back to me, 
So I 
tell him my husband he never can be, 
For my love, my love will come back to me. 
The lasses have wedded the lads they loved, 
And the villagers gaze at me, 
And they whisper that Jamie will never come back, 
From his voyage far o'er the sea; 
And Edward still comes to our cottage door, 
For a 
word and a 
smile from me, 
And urges his suit with each coming year, 
Yet my husband he never can be. 
Yes, I 
tell him my husband he never can be, 
For I 
know that James will come back to Inc, 
So I 
tell him my husband he never can be, 
For my love, my love will come back to me. 
A white-winged vessel sails up the bay, 
And it gladdens my weary eyes, 
For I 
know that my Jamie is on its deck, 
And my heart to his welcome flies; 
I 
know I 
have waited, but not in vain, 
For my Jamie to come to me, 
And now we shall never be parted more, 
lie has come from the deep blue sea. 
Yes, I 
told them my heart was far over the sea, 
For I 
knew that ,Times would come back to me.

Little Tottie's in the meadow, 
Where the morning sunbeam lies, 
Where the clover blooms are thickest, 
Chasing golden butterflies. 
Here and there she picks a 
flower, 
And a 
merry song she sings, 
As she tries in vain to capture 
One with yellow-spotted wings.

Little Tottie's in the meadow, 
Where the morning sunbeam lies, 
Where the clover blooms are thickest, 
Chasing golden butterflies! 
Now her laugh rings out so cheery, 
As she frights the honey-bee, 
As he sips from fragrant roses, 
Nectar fit for king to see; 
Then she shouts aloud for " mamma!" 
As she nears the butterfly, 
Saying, " mamma, come and help me, 
You can catch him if you try !" (Cno.) 
• 
Little Tottie, sweetest sunbeam 
That has blest our earthly way, 
May the brightness that surrounds thee 
Never, never pass away! . 
And though contact dims the luster 
Of the butterfly's gilt wings, 
May'st thou find the priceless blessings, 
Fading not with earthly things ! (Quo.)

Gone where the shadows of life can not come, 
Where every stranger may find a 
sweet home ; 
Severed the chain that has bound them to earth, 
Gone to the land where the soul has new birth; 
Where there are treasures of beauty untold, 
Rivers of silver and mountains of gold, 
Weep not to miss o4,e from earth's weary shore, 
Earth has an angel less, Heaven one more. 
CHORUS. 
Where there are treasures of beauty untold, 
Rivers of silver and mountains of gold, 
Weep not to miss one from earth's weary shore, 
Earth has an angel less, heaven one more. 
Gone where the angels are chanting His praise, 
Freed from the tumult of earth's dreary ways, 
Gone from the darkness of life's bitter night, 
Into the stillness of heaven's sweet light; 
Only a 
brief while before we must go, 
From life's mixed chalice, its joy and its woe, 
Weep not to miss one from earth's weary shore, 
Earth has an angel less, heaven one more. 
Gone where the battle is over and won, 
And the true life of the spirit begun ; 
Gone where the anthem is full and complete, 
Sung by the angels in heavenly street; 
Gone where the harvest is gathered to God, 
Soul to its Maker and dust to its sod, 
Weep not to miss one from earth's weary shore, 
Earth has an angel less, heaven one more.

In Heaven 
Rock Thee to Sleep.

Yes, darling one, I 
will rock thee to sleep, 
Stay not to murmur, or sadly to weep, 
Smile, though.thy pathway is rugged and cold, 
Soon shall I 
greet thee in heaven's sweet fold; 
Cease thy repinings, for troubles must come, 
Where'er on earth thou shalt find thee a 
home, 
Over life's desert the shadows will creep, 
In realms of joy I 
will rock thee to sleep. 
CII011US. 
Over life's desert shadows will creep, 
In realms of joy I 
will rock thee to sleep, 
In realms of joy I 
will rock thee to sleep. 
No love like that of thy mother thou'lt find, 
No hand to guide thee, no ties that will bind, 
No eyes to watch tine, and no heart to love, 
As love the angels in mansions above; 
Still doth my heart sweetly roam to my child, 
When tempests come, and when life's night is wild, 
Over my darling my fond watch I'll keep, 
Till when in heaven Pll rock thee to sleep. (Ciro.) 
Soon wilt thou cross the dark river of death, 
Ere long thou wilt feel the great reaper's cold 
breath, 
Angels shall bear thee from life's cheerless shore, 
To realms where beauty shall fade nevermore; 
Sweet songs shall greet thee and bright forms ap- - 
pear, 
Nevermore care and grief's shadows thoult fear, 
But where dwells happiness, lasting and deep, 
Gladly, my loved one, I'll rock thee to sleep.
