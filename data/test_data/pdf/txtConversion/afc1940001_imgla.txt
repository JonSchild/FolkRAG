I'M GLAD MY WIFE'S IN EUROPE. I'm glad my wife's in Europe,And she can't get back, she can't get
back.While I'm making lamb ? and cheese,? with the refugees.The only way she can get backIs to
swim across the seas.I am sorry there must be war,I don't know what they're fighting for,But I'm glad
my wife is in Europe,For she can't get back to me.
