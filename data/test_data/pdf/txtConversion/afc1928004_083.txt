I CANNOT CALL HER MOTHER. 
The marriage rite is over; 
And though I 
turn aside, 
To keep the guests from seeing 
The tears I 
could not hide, 
I 
wreathed my face in smiling, 
And led my little brother, 
To greet my father's chosen; 
But I 
cou'd not call her Mother I 
She is a 
fair young creature, 
With meek and gentle air; 
With blue eyes soft and loving, 
And silken sunny hair, 
I 
know my father gives her, 
The love he bore another; 
But if she were an angel, 
I 
could not call her Mother 
To night I 
heard her singing, 
A song I 
used to love, 
When its sweet notes were uttered, 
By her who sings above: 
It pained my heart to bear it, 
And my tears I 
could not smother, 
For every word was hallowed, 
By the dear voice of my Mother. 
My father, in the sunshine 
Of happy days to come, 
May half forget the shadow, 
That darkened our old home, 
His heart no more is lonely ; 
But me, and little brother, 
Must still be orphan children— 
God can give us but one Mother!

Tr* PINIGAN'S 
Air:—" The French Musician." 
Tim Finigan lived in Walker street, 
A 
gehtleman Irishman—mighty odd— 
He'd a 
beautiful brogue, so rich and sweet— 
And to rise in the world, he carried the hod, 
nut, you see he'd a 
sort of a 
tippling way, 
With a 
love for the liquor poor Tim was born, 
To help him through his work each day, 
Lle'd a 
drop of the creatur' every morn'. 
CHORUS. 
Whack, hurrah! blood and 'ounds! ye soul, ye, 
Welt the fibre, ye're trotters shake 
Isn't it the truth I've tould ye ? 
Lots of fun, at Finigan's wake I 
One morning, Tim was rather fu , 
His bead felt heavy, which made him shake, 
He fell from the ladder, and broke his skull— 
So they carried him home, his corpse to wake. 
They rolled him up in a 
nice clean sheet, 
And laid him out. upon a 
bed, 
With fourteen candles round his feet, 
And a 
couple of dozen around his head. 
Whack, hurrah 1 &c. 
His friends assembled at the wake, 
Missus Finigau called out for the lunch. 
First, they lay in tay and cake; 
Then pipes and tobacky,' and whiskerpunch 
Miss Biddy O'Brien began to cry: 
Such a 
purty corpse did ever you see ? 
Arrah I 
Tim avourneen, an' why did ye die? 
Och, none of your gab, sez Judy Magee. 
Whack, hurrah I &c. 
• 
Then, Peggy O'Connor took up the job: 
Arrah ! Biddy, says she, you're wrong I'm sure. 
But July, then, gave her a 
belt on the gob, 
And left her sprawling on the flure, 
Eltch side in war did soon engage, 
'Twas woman to woman and man to man; 
Shillaleb-law was all the rage— 
An' a 
bloody ruction soon began. 
Whack, hurrah! 
THE WANDERING RR-FUGER 
Micky Mulvaney raised hii head, 
When a 
gallon of whisky" or at hint: 
It missed him—and, hopping on the bed 
The liquor scattered over Tim, 
Bedad! he revives! .soe h)w ho raises! 
An' Timothy, jumping from the bed, 
(hies, while he lathered around, like blazes, 
Bad luck till yer souls I 
Tye think I'm dead!

-WOODMAN SPARE TEAT TREE. 
'Wards by a P. 
MORRIS. 
Music by 11-RussEr.u. 
Woodman, spare that tree, 
Touch not a 
single bough, 
In youth it sheltered me, 
And I'll protect it now. 
'Twas my forefather's hand 
That placed it near his cot, 
-There, woodman, let it stand, 
Thy axe shall harm it not. 
That old familiar tree, 
Whose glory and renown 
Are spread o'er land and sea, 
Say, wouldst thou hack it down:! 
'Woodman, forbear thy stroke, 
Cut not its earth=bound ties, 
13, spare that aged oak, 
Now towering to the skies. 
-Oft when a 
careless child, 
Beneath its shade I 
heard 
The wood-notes sweet and wild 
Of many a 
forest bird. 
My mother kissed me here, 
My father pressed my hand, 
I 
itsk you with a 
tear, 
To let that old oak stand. 
My 
heart-strings round thee cling, 
-Close to thy hark, old friend, 
'Here shall the wild bird sing, 
And still thy branches bend. 
Old tree the storm still brave, 
And woodman leave the spot, 
'While I've a 
hand to save, 
-Thy axe shall harm it not.

Words by A. Bt. 
Oh! smile as thou wert wont to smile, 
Before the weight of care 
Had crushed thy heart, and for awhile 
Left nought but sorrow there. 
Some thoughts, perchance, ' twere best to quell,„ 
Some impulse to forget, 
On which should memory cease to dwell, 
We may be happy yet. 
Oh never name departed days, 
Nor vows you whispered then, 
Round which too sad a 
feeling plays 
To trust their tones again. 
Regard their shadows round thee eas4 
As if we ne"er had met; 
And thus, unmindful of the past,. 
We may be happy yet.

THE LONE ROCK BY THE SEA,_ 
Oh ! tell me not the woods are fair, 
Now spring is on her way: 
Well, well I 
know how brightly, there, 
In joy the young leaves play ; 
How sweet, on winds of morn or eve, 
The violet's breath may be; 
Yet ask me, woo me not to leave 
My lone rock by the sea. 
The wild waves' thunder on the shore, 
The curlew's restless cries, 
Unto my watching heart are more 
Than all earth's melodies, 
Come back, my ocean rover, come I 
There's but one place for me, 
Till I 
can greet thy swift sails home, t.

WILLIE, WE HAVE MISSED YOU. 
Words and Music by STEPHEN C. 
FosTint. 
Oh l 'Willie, is it you, dear, safe, safe at home ? 
They did not tell me true, dear; they said you would not 
come. 
1 
heard you tut the gate, and it made my heart rejoice; 
For, I knew that welcome footstep, and that familiar 
voice, 
Making music on my ear in the lonely midnight gloom. 
Oh 1 'Willie, we have missed you—welcome, welcome home! 
We've longed to see you nightly, but this night of. 
all, 
The fire was blazing brightly, and lights were in the hall ; 
The little ones were up till ' twits ten o'clock and past, 
Then their eyes began to twinkle, and they've gone to sleep 
at last! 
But they listened for your voice till they thought you'd 
never come, 
Oh I 
Willie we have missed you—welcome, welcome home. 
The days were sad without you, the nights were long and 
d 
rear, 
My dreams have been about you, oh l 
welcome, Willie 
dear; 
Last night, I 
wept and watched, by the moonlight's cheerless 
ra y, 
Till I 
thought I 
heard your footstep, then I 
wiped my tears 
away; 
But my heart grew sad again, when I 
found you had not 
come; 
Oh I 
Willie, we have missed you—welcome, welcome home.

With a

Then with passion shook, then quietly took

THE HUSBAND'S DREAM. 
Why, Dermot, you look healthy, now, your dress is neat and 
clean: 
I 
never see you drunk about, oh! tell me where you've 
been; 
Your wife and family all are well, you once did use them 
strange; 
Oh! you are kinder to them now, how came the happy change ? 
It was a 
dream, a warning voice, which Heaven & nt to 
me. 
To snatch me from the drunkard's curse, grim want and 
misery; 
My wages all were spent in drink, oh ! what a 
wretched 
view! 
I 
almost broke my Mary's heart, and starved my children 
too. 
What was my home or wife to me ? I 
heeded not her sigh; 
Her patient smile has welcomed me when tears bedimmed 
her eye; 
My children, too, have oft awoke; oh, father dear, they've 
said, 
Poor Mother has been weeping so because we've had no 
bread. 
My Mary's form did waste away, I 
saw her sunken eye, 
On straw my babes in sickness laid, I 
heard their wailing 
cry; 
I 
laughed and sung in drunken joy, while Mary's tears did 
stream, 
Then like a 
beast I 
fell asleep and had this warning dream! 
THE HUSBAND'S DREAM —[coNcLuDED.] 
I 
thought I 
once more staggered home, there seemed a 
solemn 
gloom; 
I 
missed my wife, where can she be ? and strangers in the 
room; 
I 
heard them say; Poor thing, she's dead, she led a 
wretched 
life, 
Grief and want has broken her heart ; who'd be a 
drunkard's 
wife r' 
I 
saw my children weeping round, I 
scarcely drew my breath; 
They called and kissed her lifeless form for ever stilled in 
death. 
Oh! father, come and wake her up, the people say she's dead, 
Oh! make her smile and speak once more, we'll never cry for 
bread. 
She is not dead , t 
frantic cried, aud rushed to where she 
lay, 
And madly kissed her once warm lips, forever cold as clay; 
Oh! Mary, speak one word to we, no more I'll cause you 
pain, 
No more I'll grieve your loving heart, nor ever drink again. 
Dear Mary, speak, 'tis Dermot calls. Why, so I do! she 
cried. 
'woke and true my Mary dear was kneeling by my side. 
I 
pressed her to my throbbing heart, while joyous tears did 
stream, 
And ever since I've heaven blessed for sending me that

THE RING MY MOTHER WORE. 
VIE STANDARD BEARER. 
Upon the tented field a 
Minstrel Knight, 
Beside his standard lonely watch was keeping, 
And thus, amid the stillness of the night, • 
He strikes his lute, while all around is sleeping— 
CHORUS. 
The lady of my love—I 
will not name, 
Although I 
wear her colors as a 
token, 
For I 
would fight for liberty and fame, 
Beneath the flag where first our vows were spoken. 
The night is past, the conflict's come with dawn, 
The Minstrel Knight has seen its fortifyihg ; 
'Midst . 
death and carnage onward still are borne— 
His song is heard ' midst thousands around him dying. 
The lady of my love, & c. 
Stern Death now sated quits the gory plain ; 
The life blood from the Warrior Bard is streaming, 
White on his gag he rests his band with pain, 
And faintly sins— his eyes with fervor beaming. 
The lady of my love I 
will not name ; • 
I'll still retain her colors as a 
token ; 
I've fought and fell for lib( rty and fame, 
And never have our knightly vows been broken.

LOUIS DEL.. 
The earth has many treasures raie, 
In gems and golden ore; 
My heart hath one more precious far— 
The ring my mother wore, 
I 
saw it first, when I, a 
child, 
playing by her side ; 
She told me then, 'twas father's gift, 
When she became his bride.. 
I 
saw it oft in sorrow's /mars, 
Which marked the after years, 
When shining on the soft, white hand, 
That wiped away my tears,. 
And oh! I 
savr it once again, 
When, on her dying bed, 
She lifted up her hand in prayer 
And laid it on my head. 
Beside that bed, where fell my tears, 
The ring to me was given; 
She placed it on my baud, and said: 
" 
We'll meet again in heaven I" 
I 
kissed the cheek I 
oft had pressed. 
From which the rose bad fled ; 
And bowed with grief, stood motherh ,ss, 
Alone, beside the dead. 
Among the blest in realms above, 
Where sorrows are unknOwn, 
Oh ! may I 
meet my mother clear, 
No more to weep alone. 
Her dying words of love and faith, 
I'll cherish evermore, 
Within the heart which bolds so dear, 
The ring my mother wore. 
THE HAZEL DELL. 
In the Hazel Dell my Nelly's sleeping, 
Nelly loved so long: 
And my lonely, lonely watch I'm keeping, 
Nelly lost and gone; 
Here, in moonlight, often we have wandered 
Through the silent shade; 
Now where leafy branches drooping, 
Little Nelly's laid. 
CHORUS. 
All alone my watch I'm keeping 
In the Hazel Dell; 
For, my darling Nelly's near me sleeping, 
Nelly, dear, farewell! 
(Repeat. ) 
In the Hazel Dell my Nelly's Sleeping, 
Where the flowers wave, 
And the silent stars are nightly weeping 
O'er poor Nelly's grave; 
Hopes that once my bosom fondly cherished, 
Smile no more for me, 
Every dream of joy, alas I 
has perished, 
Nelly dear, with thee. 
All alone my watch, Sic. 
Now I'm weary, friendless and forsaken, 
Watching here alone; 
Nelly, thou no more will fondly cheer me, 
With thy loving tone. 
Yet forever shall thy gentle image 
In my mem'ry dwell, 
And my tears thy lonely grave shall moisten, 
Nelly dear, farewell 
All alone my watch, &c.

And

Up, up %% ith my flag, let it float o'er the sea,

The night gathers o'er us, the thunder is heard, 
What matter ? our vessel skims on.like a 
bird; 
What to her is the dash of- 
the storm-ridden main, 
She has braved it before and will brave it again. 
The fire-gleaming flashes around us may fall--
They may strike, they may grieve, but they cannot appal; 
With lightning above us, and darkness below, 
Through the wild Waste of waters right onward we go. 
Hurrah I 
my brave comrades, ye may drink, ye may sleep, 
The storm fiend is hushed, we're alone on the deep ; 
Our flag of defl . nce still waves o'er the sea,

grave in the wild wood shade 
Where the trees gently wave in the bloom, 
Where the wild birds sing, and the soft summer air 
Wafts seas of melodies o'er her tomb. 
'Tis there little Carrie Lee lies sleeping in death 
The pride of the village was she; 
There many friends, in their gloom, 
Sadly weep o' er the grave of our own Carrie Lee.

Then sleep, let her sleep in the grave we have made; 
From the cares of the world she is free;

'Where the violets now bloom in the green, 
Where naught is heard but the warbling of birds, 
And the noi ,e

No more her sweet smile can be been ; 
But, all hushed now in death, she has gone to her rest,

And such the trust that still were mine,

love. 
citORTIS. 
Dear Evelina, sweet Evelina, 
My love for thee shall never, never die. 
She's straight as a 
post, like an eel she's sleek, 
And she never was knonm to put paint on her cheeks; 
In neat graceful curls hangs her raven black ,hair, 
And she never requires perfumery there. 
Sweet Evelina, &c. 
Evelina and I, one evening in Jane, 
Took a 
walk all alone, by the light of the moon— 
The planets shone, for the heavens were clear, 
And I 
felt round my heart most mightily queer. 
Sweet Evelina, &c. 
Three years have gone by, and I've not got a 
dollar, 
Evelina still lives in the green grassy hollow, 
Although I 
am fated to marry her never, 
I'm sure it will last for ever and ever. 
Sweet Evelina, &c.

I'll give you a 
kiss for a

And all the fond yews that I've made you, I'll keep— 
What more can I 
promise than this ? 
Does the sea have such bright and such beautiful charms 
That your heart will not leave it for me ? 
Oh! why did I

Like a

And my heart is still trusting and kind; 
It was you who first took it, and can you forget, 
That love for another you'd find ? 
No I 
no ! if you break it with sorrow and pain, 
I'll then have a

If you'll bring it to me, I'll mend it again, 
And trust it, dear Shamus, to you.

ST. PATRICK WAS A GENTLEMAN. 
Oh I 
St. Patrick was a 
gentleman, 
Who came of decent people: 
He built a 
church in Dublin town, 
And on it built a 
steeple. 
His father was a 
Gallagher, 
His mother was a 
Brady, 
His aunt was an O'Shaughnessy, 
His uncle an O'Grady. 
CHORUS. 
So, success attend St. Patrick's fist, 
For he's a 
saint so clever; 
Oh! he gave the snakes and toads a 
twist,. 
And banished them for ever. 
The Wicklow Hills are very high, 
And so's the bill of Howth, sir ; 
But there's a 
hill much bigger still, 
Much higher nor them both, sir. 
`Twas on the top of this hill, 
St. Patrick preached his sarmint 
That drove the frogs into the bogs, 
And banished all the varmint. 
Oh I 
success, 
There's not a 
mile in Ireland's isle 
Where dirty varmin musters, 
But there lie put his dear fore- foot, 
And murdered them in clusters. 
The toads went pop, the frogs went hop, 
Slap dash into the water, 
And the snakes committed suicide 
To save themselves from slaughter. 
Oh I 
success, Ste. 
ST. PATRICK WAS A GENTLEMAN.—[cortmvnED.1 
Nine hundred thousand reptiles blue 
He charmed with sweet discourses, 
And dined on them at Killa]oe, 
In soups and second courses.. 
Where blind worms crawling in the grass 
Disgusted all the nation, 
And gave them a 
rise which opened their eyes, 
To a 
sense of their situation. 
Oh I 
success, &e.. 
No wonder that those Irish lads 
Should be so gay and frisky, 
For sure St. Pat he taught them that, 
As well as making whiskey; 
No wonder that the saint himself 
Should understand distilling, 
Since his mother kept a 
shebeen shop 
In the town of Enniskillen. 
Oh r 
success, rte. 
Oh! was I 
but so fortunate 
As to be back in Munster, 
'Tis I'd be bound, that from the ground 
I 
never more would once stir. 
For there St. Patrick planted turf, 
And plenty of the praties; 
With pigs galore, ma gm, ma store, 
And cabbages—and ladies.

Then my blessing on St. Patrick's fist, 
For he's the darling saint, 0 1 
Oh he gave the snakes aud toads a

One day be had stuft'd him full as an egg, 
When a

But he kick'd him out without broaching a

And in kicking hint out he broke his leg. 
Ri too ral, &c. 
A 
surgeon—the first in his vocation, 
Came and made a

So finished his joly by amputation.

Said Mynheer, says be, when he'd done his work, 
By your sharp knife I

But on two crutches I 
never will stalk, 
For I'll have a 
beautiful leg of cork. 
Ri too ral, &c. 
An artist in Rotterdam ' twould seem, 
Had made cork legs his study and theme; 
Each joint was as strong as an iron beam, 
The springs a 
compouud of clock work and steam.

The leg was made and fitted tight, 
Inspection the artist did invite, 
The fine shape gave Mynheer delight, 
As he fixed it on and screwed it tight. 
Ri too.ral, 
THE cppa LEG,—[CONCLUDED.3 
He walk'd through squares and past each shop, 
Of speed lie went to the utmost top ; 
Each step be took with a

And he found his leg he could not stop. 
Ri too ral, 
Horror and fright were in his face, 
The neighbors thought lie was running a 
race; 
He clung toa gas lamp post to stay his pace, 
But the leg wouldn't stay but kept on the chase. 
Ri too ral, &c. 
Then he card to some men with all his might,. 
‘` Oh, stop this leg, or I'm murder'd quite!" - 
But though they heard him 8,id invite, 
He in less than a 
minute was out of sight. 
Ri too ral, &c. 
He ran o'er hill and dale and plain, 
To ease his weary bones he'd fain; 
Did throw himself down but all in vain, 
The leg got up and was off again. 
He walk'd of days. and nights tt.scoe,. 
Of Europe lie had made the tour; 
He died—but though he was no more, 
The leg walk'd on the same as before.

My tale I've told both plain and free,

THE GLORIOUS VINTAGE OF CHAMPAGNE. 
Words by EDMUND FALCONER. 
Music by M. 
W. 
BALFZ. 
When fortune frowns and friends forsake, 
And faith in love is dead; 
When man has nothing left to stake, 
To hope, nor yet to dread, 
One god-like pleasure doth remain, 
Worth all the joys he's lost— 
The glorious vintage of champagne, 
To drink at some knave's cost. 
CHORUS. 
Let life's last song have for refrain, 
The glorious vintage of champagne. 
When one by one fade all the beams, 
That light morning's path, 
So dull the world around us seems, 
At life itself we're wrath. 
New vigour then would we regain, 
Let's drink at some knave's cost, 
The glorious vintage of champagne, 
Worth all the joys we've lost. 
Let life's last song, (to. 
BEAUTIFUL VENICE. 
Beautiful Venice! City of song! 
What mem'ries of old to thy regiols belong! 
What sweet recollections still ciing to my heart. 
As thy fast- fading shores from my vision depart! 
Oh I 
poesy's home is thy light colonades, 
Where the wind gently sigh as the sweet twilight fades I 
CHORUS. 
I 
have known many homes, but the dwelling' for me, 
Is beautiful Venice, the bride of the sea! 
Beautiful Venice! queen of the earth 
Where dark eyes shine brightly ' mid music and mirth, 
Where gay serenaders, by light of the star, 
Oft mingle their sotto- with the dulcet guitar: 
All that's lovely in life, all that's deathless in song, 
Fair Italy's Isle 
to thy regions belong I 
I 
have known many homes, &c. 
CROSSING ON THE FERRY. 
Oh I 
please don't laugh when I 
relate 
To you a 
story sweet: 
It's all about a 
charming girl 
That I 
by chance did meet. 
'Twas love at first sight when we met, 
Those lips so red and cherry. 
Oh I 
what a 
stunning girl it was, 
That I 
met on the ferry. 
CHORUS. 
Walking through the cabin, passing all the style, 
Smiling on the fair sex, hours to beguile, 
Nothing yet can cheer me; for, I 
can't be merry, 
Since I 
met that little dear crossing on the ferry. 
I 
scarcely knew which way to look; 
For, she a 
magnet seemed; 
Electric sparks I 
thought I 
felt, 
So bright her eyes they beamed; 
For, every glance was like a 
lance, 
As in my heart they'd bury : 
Until I 
felt, I 
scarce know how, 
While crossing on the ferry. 
Walking through the cabin, tto. 
Our journey's end at last approached, 
My heart beat slow and fast, 
While passengers ran here and there, 
My love among them passed. 
She turned her head and spoke to me. 
In a 
voice so soft and merry, 
Saying : 
Write a 
note to Station D. 
Sign, Crossing on the ferry. 
Walking through the cabin, &c.

THE BANKS OF CLAUDY. 
It was on a 
summer's morning all in the month of May, 
Down by you flowery garden where Betsy did stray, 
overlie:L rd a 
damsel in sorrow to coin plain, 
Al 1 
for her absent lover that plows the raging main. 
I 
went up to this fair maid and put her in surprise, 
I 
own she did not know me, I 
being in disguise. 
Said I : my charming creature, my joy and heart's delight, 
how far do you travel this dark and rainy night ? 
The way, kind sir, to Claudy, if you please to show, 
Pity a 
maid distracted, for there I 
have to go ;' 
I 
ant in search of a 
faithless young man, Johnny is his name, 
AU on the bauk of Claudy I 
am told he does remain. 
If Johnny was here this night, he'd keep me from all harm. 
H'5 in the field of battle all in his uniform; 
As he's in the field of battle, his foes lie will destroy, 
Like a 
ruling king of honor he fought in the wars of Troy. 
It's six weeks and better since your true love left the shore, 
He, is cruising the wide ocean where foaming billows roar, 
lie's cruising the wide ocean for honor and gain, 
I 
was told the ship was wrecked off the coast of Spain. 
When she heard the dreadful news, she fell in despair, 
To wringing of her bands amil tearing of her hair. 
Since he is gone and left me, no man I 
will take, 
In some lonesome valley I 
will wander for his sake. 
His heart was filled with joy, no longer be could stand, 
lie flew into her arms, saying, Betsy, I 
ant the man ; 
I 
am the faithless young man whom you thought was slain, 
And since we are met on Claudy's banks we'll never part again. 
THE BLACKBIRD. 
It was on one fine morning for soft recreation, 
I 
heard a 
fair damsel making a 
sad ! roan, 
Sighing and sobbing with sad lamentati 
Saying Inc Blacabird most loyal has flown. 
My thoughts they deceived me, reflection. it grieves me, 
And I 
ant o'er-burden'd with sad in:silty ; 
But if death should blind me, as true love ine:ines me, 
My Blackbird Iill iseek out wherever I 
Fe. 
Once in fair England my Blackbird did flourish, 
lie was th 
chief- flower that in it did spring, 
Fair ladies of honor his person did nourish, 
Because that he was the true son of a 
king 
But 0, that false fortune lias proved 80 uncertain, 
That caus'd the parting b 
two 0 
you and me, 
But if he remain in Era cc or in S;-ain, 
I'll he true to my Blackbird wherever ho be. 
In England my Blackbird mind I 
were together, 
When he AV.S the most noble and gen'rons of heart, 
But woe to the time when be arrived there, 
Alas l 
he was soon forced from me to part. 
In Italy he beam'd and was highly esteemed, 
In England he seems but a 
s ranger to me, 
But if he remain in Franc 
or in Spain, 
All blessings on my Blackbird wherever he be. 
But if by the fowler my Blackbii.d is taken, 
Sighing and sobbing will be all the tune, 
But if he i 
safe, and I'm not mistaken, 
I 
hopeil shall see him in Iilay or in June. 
The birds of the forest, they all flock together, 
The turn,: was chosen to dwell whim the dove, 
So I'm r 
solved in fair cr f 
Once in the spring to seek out my love. 
Oh, lie is all my treasure, may joy and my pleasure.

It's not the wide ocean can fright me with danger,

For I'll find more friendship from one that's a

That lives in Tipperary.

A

knowed him well. 
Leftenant Carter's only son, 
A comely youth nigh twenty-one. 
On Monday morning he did go, 
Into the meadow for to mow, 
And all ter once he thar did feel, 
A 
pizen sarpent bite his heel. 
Quick as he felt the sn.rpent bite,' 
He raised his scythe with all his might-, 
He strick ter once a 
deadly blow, 
That laid the pizen creature low. 
He tuk the ryptiIe in his hand, 
And straight he went to Molly Bland: 
Oh I

pizen sarpent what bit me.

why did you go, 
Inter the meadow for to mow ? 
Oh Molly Bland, I

And sucked p'zen from the wound; 
But oh I 
she had a 
rotten tooth, 
The venim soon affected both°. 
Oh I

With all the colors the sarpent wore;

WINKING AT DIE. 
Kind friends, your attention I'll ask for a 
while, 
And I'll try to amuse you in my simple style, 
To sing to you nightly it's a 
pleasure, I 
see : 
For the gents in the house all keep winking at me.

'Winking at me, winking at me,

sing while you're winking at me? 
Tnere's a

terrible plight, 
He's lately been jilted by a 
fair one you see, 
And now he comes here and keeps winking at me. 
Winking at me, &c. 
Mr.  , our leader, as every one knows,

rose in his buttonhole, 
No wonder you blush, sir o married man as you be, 
To sit there all night and keep winking at me. 
Winking at me, &c. 
There's a 
gent, sitting there, dressed . with elegant taste. 
By the side of a

THE EXILE OF ERIN. 
There came to to the beach a 
poor exile of Erin. 
The dew on his robe was heavy and chill : 
For his country he sighed when at twilight repairing, 
To wander alone by the wind- beaten hill. 
But the day- star attracted his eyes's sad devotion: 
For, it rose on his own native isle of the ocean, 
Where once, , in the flow of his youthful emotion, 
He sang the bold Anthem of Erin go brag,h. 
Oh ! sad is my fate, said the heart- broken stranger, 
The wild deer and wolf to a 
covert can flee, 
But I 
have no refuge from famine or danger, 
A 
home -and a 
country renains not for me! 
! 
never again, in the green shady Lower 
Where my foretatlers lived, shall f 
spend the sweet hotm 
Or cover my harp with the wild-woven flowers, 
And strike the sweet numbors of Erin go bragh! 
Oh, Erin, my country! though sad and forsaken, 
In dreams I 
revisit thy sea- beaten slore ; 
But, alas! in a 
far foreiou land I 
awaken, 
And sigh for the friends that can meet me no more; 
I 
And thou, cruel Fate! wilt thou never replace Ine 
In

A

Tney dhd to defend me, or live to deplore, 
Where now is my cabin-door, so fast by the wildwood ? 
Sisters and sire did weep. for its fall. 
Where is the not her that looked on my childhood ? 
And where is may bosom- friend —doer•than all ?

BEN BOLT: 
Oh ! don't you remember sweet Alice, Ben Bolt, 
Sweet Alice, with eyes hazel brown, 
flow he wept with delight when you gave her a 
smiler 
And trembled with fear at your frown. 
In the old churchyard, in the valley, Ben Bolt, 
In a 
corner obscure and alone ; 
They have fitted a 
slab- of granite so gray, 
And sweet Alice lies under the stone. 
Oh! don't you remember the wood, Ben Bolt, 
Near the green sunny slope of the hill, 
Where oft we have sung, 'neath its wide spreading shade; 
And kept time to the click of the mill. 
The mill has gone to decay, Ben Bolt, 
And a 
quiet now reigns all around; 
See the old rustic po?cli, with its roses so sweet, 
Lies scattered ell over ttie ground. 
Oh! don't you remember the school, Ben Bolt, 
And the master so kind and true; 
And the little nook, by the clear running brook, 
Where we gathered the flowers as they grew. 
O'er the master's grave grom a 
the grass, Ben Bolt, 
And the clear running brook is now dry; 
And of all our old friends, who were schoolmates, then, 
There remains, Ben, but you and I. 
/ HAVE TRIED NOT TO LOVE THEE.. 
I 
have tried not to love thee, 
To- drive from my heart 
Each sweet recollection, 
With which I 
should part: 
The one gleam of sunshine, 
My life has ever known, 
Thy smile, and the music 
Thy voice made alone. 
I've tried not to love thee, 
To drive from my heart 
Each sweet recollection,. 
With which I 
should part. 
I 
may never more see thee, 
And hope may depart: 
But why should I 
banish 
Thy love from my heart ? 
'Tis all that you've left me, 
The old golden beam 
Of light to illumine 
Life's future dark stream. 
I've tried not to love thee, ito, 
SEND BACK MY BARNEY TO ME. 
He is gone, and Pin now sad and lonely, 
He has left me to cross the wide sea, 
But I 
know that he thinks of me only, 
And will soon be returning to me. 
His eyes they were filled with devotion, 
As my husband he said he'd soon be, 
Then blow gently ye winds of the ocean, 
And send back my Barney to me. 
If at night as I 
rest on my pillow, 
The wind heaves a 
moan and a 
sigh, 
I 
think of each angry billow, 
And watch every cloud o'er the sky. 
My bosom it fills with emotion, 
As I 
pray for one over the sea, 
Then blow gently ye winds of the ocean, 
And send back my Barney to me. 
He has left me his fortune to better, 
I 
know that he went for my sake, 
Soon I'll be receiving a 
letter, 
If not sure my poor heart will break, 
To say that he'll soon be returning, 
To his dear native Ireland and me, 
Then blow gently ye winds of the ocean. 
And send back my Barney to me.

BINGEN ON THE RHINE. 
A

tears ; 
But a 
comrade stood beside him, while his life-bloOd ehbeil away 
A:01 bent with pi: ying glances to hear what he might say. 
The dying soldier faltered as he took that comrade's hand, 
And he sad

Take a

Tell my brothers and companions, when they meet and crowd 
around 
To hear my mournful st ,ry, in the pleasant vine-yard ground, 
That we fiugh the battle brtvely, and when the hay was done, 
Full many a 
corpse lay ghastly pale beneath the setting stm ; 
An 1 ' mid it the dead and dying were some groiva old in ' wars, 
The death- won nil on their ga lant breasts t.ie last of :many sears ; 
But some Ivcre yo. lig, and suddenly b • held

And one had come from Bingen—fair Bingen on the P. 
Tell my mother that her other sons shall comfort her old age; 
And I 
was, ave, a

For my father was a

My heart leaped forili to hear him tell of s-ritg,;les fierce and wild. 
And w

BINGEN ON THE RHINE.---EcONCLUDED.] 
And if a 
comrade seek her love, I 
ask her, in my name, 
To listen to him kindly, without regret or shame, 
And to hang the o 
d 
sword in its place (my father's sword and 
thine, 
For the honor of old Bingen -- dear Bingen on the Rhine. 
There's another not a

You'd have known her by the merriment that sparkled-in her eve ; 
Too ilmocent for coquetry—too fond for idle se ;

Tellher that the last night of my life,--- for ere this m ,- on be risen, 
My body will be out of pai n, my soul be out of prison---
I 
dreamt I 
stood wi h 
her, and saw the yellow sunlight shine 
On the vie- clad kids of Bin,;(en---fair Bingen on the Rhine. 
I 
saw the blue Rhine sweep along, I 
heard, or seemed to hear 
The Germa so ag 
we used to sing in chorus sweet and clear; 
And down he pleasant river, and up the slanting hill, 
That echoing eh - rus sounded through the eve ing calm and still ; 
And her glad blue eyes were on me, as we passed with friend y 
talk 
Down many a

ot yore and well remembered walk; 
And her little hand lay lightly, confi lingly in mine, 
But we'll meet no more at Bite-

His voice grew faint and hoarser, Ids grasp was childish weak--
His eyes put on a 
clyin4 look, he sighed, and ceased to speak— 
His comride bent to lift bun, b t 
the spark of life was lc d, 
The sol icr of th Legion i a 
foreign land was dead! 
And the soft moon rose up slow y, and calmly she looked down 
On the red sad o 
the battle-field, with bloody corpses strewn ; 
Yea, calmly on th it dreadful scene her pale light seemed to shine, 
As it shone on distant Biogeu-4.dr Bingen on the Rhine!

FIVE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING. 
Words and Music by CLARIBEL. 
The dew lay glittering o'er the grass, 
A mist lay over the brook, 
At the earliest beam of the golden sun, 
The swallow her nest forsook. 
The snowy blooms of the hawthorn tree, 
Lay thickly the ground adorning, 
The birds were singing in every bush 
At five o'clock in the morning. 
The birds were singing in every bush 
At five o'clock in the morning. 
And Bessie, the milkmaid, merrily sang-, 
For meadows were fresh and fair. 
The breeze of the morning k 
ssed her brow, 
And played with her nut-brown hair, 
But oft she turned and looked around, 
As if the silence scorning; 
'Twas time for the mower to whet his scythe, 
At five o'clock in the morning, 
'Twas time for the mower to whet his scythe, 
At five o'clock in the morning. 
And over the meadow the mowers came, 
And merry their voices rang, 
And one among them wended his way, 
To where the milkmaid sang. 
And as he lingered by her side, 
Despite his comrade's warning, 
The old, old story was told again, 
At five o'clock in the morning. 
The old, old story was told again, 
At five o'clock in the morning. 
I'VE NO SISTER NOW. 
By THEODORE ROBBINS. 
I 
have no mother now, I'm weeping. 
Hark, the soft wind s 
sighing, 
Through every bush and tree, 
'Where now sweet sister's lying, 
Away from love and me. 
From eyes the tears are starting, 
And sorrow shades my brow, 
Oh, weary was our parting, 
I 
have flo sister now. 
I 
see the stars are shining, 
On sistoes white tombstone, 
The rose bush around it twining, 
Is here, like me, alone. 
And 
just, like me, are weeping, 
Those dewdrops from the bough 
Long time has she been sleeping, 
I 
have no sister now. 
My heart is ever lonely, 
My lire is dreary and sad. 
Twas her sweet presence only, 
That made my spirit glad, 
From morning until even, 
Care rests upon my brow, 
Bile's gone from me to heaven, 
I 
have no sister now.

THE YOUNG WIDOW. 
My path of life is choked with weeds, 
I'm wearing them because 
My late, lamented husband's gone, 
Oh, what a 
man he was! 
I 
am his relic now, alas ! 
Reduced to skin and bones, 
Through mourning day and night the late 
Lamented Mr. Jones. 
Spoken.—And what a 
pleasant man he was. I 
met him 
first at Jamaica. We had ice cream, etc. and Jones was so 
honorable he wouldn't allow me to pay. 
No, he stood treat 
and—borrowed the money off me. 
CHORUS. 
I mourn all day and night my fate, 
In melancholy tones, 
Oh, what a 
treasure was the late 
Lamented Mr. Jones. 
'We used to keep a 
liquor store, 
'Twas called the '' Lover's Arms," 
And lots of nice young men came in, 
Attracted by my charms. 
They'd squeeze my hand and talk to me, 
in such bewitching tones, 
Which often raised the ire, 
Of the late lamented Jones. 
I 
mourn, &c. 
lie trusted Inc with any one, 
And never had a 
doubt. 
The last at night who came to bed 
Would put the candle out. 
But now, alas! I 
have to pass 
My nights in tears and moans, 
And put the candle out— and not 
The late lamented Jones. 
I 
mourn, &c. 
THE YOUNG WIDOW.--lcoNcLuDED.] 
He really was a 
model man 
And sober, so to speak— 
I 
never knew him tipsy more 
Than seven times a 
week. 
But one day with a 
pewter pot„ 
Their hearts were bard as stones--
They knocked upon the head the late 
Lamentdd Mr. Jones. 
Spoken". — And he died quite peaceful, poor man, and his 
last words were—" That .he was quite happy, for he had 
pested,quite as many as had over pested him."•

There's Mr. Robinson, a 
mult 
Who's well to do in life. 
Or, Mr. Brown, the greengrocer, 
Would have me for a 
wife. 
The one makes love upon his knees, 
The other sighs and groans, 
But bless you— not a,patch upon 
The late lamented Jones. 
I 
mourn, &c. 
My lime of mourning's nearly o'er, 
I 
think l'd better go, 
Some forward chap I 
saw just. now, 
Was laughing at my,,woe. 
But though I'm bound to pass the time 
In tears and sighs and groans. 
I 
May find a 
successor to 
The late lafnented Jones, 
Spoken — But until I 
find one— 
I

There are a

To hold a

Such jolly cats are they. 
They kick up such a 
jolly row, 
In vain to sleep I 
tries, ' 
Their little claws I'm sure were made 
To scratch each other's eyes. 
For they always, &c. 
They wander round the chimney pots, 
And climb the water spout, 
And oft I 
have to throw a 
brick, 
To put them to the rout. 
And they always, tee. 
To watch their gambols and their pranks 
Sometimes is jolly fun, 
Although I 
never shot the cat, 
I 
mean to buy a 
gun. 
For they always, &c. 
They drink our milk and steal our meat., 
And think it not a 
crime, 
And when they bring forth kittens, 
They come fifty at a 
time. 
For they always, &c.

And dearly she loves me; 
Her star-like eyes are full of love 
That softly shine for me.

My light fantastic toe.

Your attention I 
ask for a 
while, 
To a 
song I'm going to sing you, 
it's about a 
pretty yeller gat I 
met while I 
was walking, 
And she threw such a 
glance- 
at me— 
She was pretty and as sweet as a 
flower, 
Such clothes you never did see— 
She'd a 
darling little bonnet with a 
flower-garden on it, 
Had the yeller gal that winked at me.

Oh my! she looked so sweet and she dressed so neat, 
With her tilting-hoops and, pretty little feet, 
As she went skipping along. 
Pretty little yeller gal I 
met while I 
-Was' walking,. 
As she skipped across the gutter, my heart went in a 
flutter 
For the yeller gal that winked at me., 
immediately asked her nnme, 
And she said it was Lucinda 
She said I 
was a . stnnner, and for life that I 
had won her, 
And married we should be. - 
So, I'd. dress up, and I'd walk by her house, 
Every afternoon; about three, 
And I'd glance up at the window for to see my dear Lucinda. 
She's the yeller gal that winked me. 
Oh my! she looked, Jce. 
Oh ! you should have seen her, on her wedding 
She was handsome as a 
Venus— 
When the Parson made us one, ah then I 
the thing was don 
And I 
never felt so happy in my life. 
So, I've bought a 
little place out of town— 
If yon go by, stop in and see— 
You'll be welcomed by a 
wife that's. as dear to me a, life, 
She's the yeller gal that winked at me.

DORAN'S ASS. 
One Paddy Doyle lived in Killarney, 
He courted a 
girl named Biddy Toole; 
His tongue was tipped with a 
bit of blarney, 
The same to Paddy was a 
golden rule. 
Both day and dawn she was his colleen, 
When to himself he'd often say: 
What need I 
care when she's my drolleen, 
A-coming to meet me on the way ? 
Whack fol de darral ido, 
Whack fol de darral lal la. 
One heavenly night in last November, 
Paddy went out to meet his love; 
What night it was, I 
don't remember, 
But the moon shone brightly from above. 
That day the boy had got some liquor, 
Which made his spirits light and gay. 
Arrah 
what's the use of walking quicker, 
When I 
know she'll meet me on the way ? 
Whack fol de darral, 
He tuned his pipes, and fell a 
humming, 
As gently onward he did jog; 
But fatigue and whiskey overcame him, 
So Paddy lay down upon the sod. 
He was not long without a 
comrade, 
One that could kick up the hay; 
For a 
big jackass soon smelt out Paddy, 
And lay down beside him, on the way. 
Whack fol de darral, &c. 
As Pat lay there in gentle slumbers, 
Thinking of his Biddy dear--
He dream't of pleasures without numbers, 
A 
coming on the ensuing year; 
DORAN'S ASS.—[CONCLUDED.) 
He spread his arms out on the grass, 
His spirits felt so light and gay— 
But instead of Biddy, he gripped the ass, 
Roaring out; I 
have her, anyway! 
Whack fol de darral, &o 
He hugged and smugged his hairy messer— 
And flung his hat to worldly care. 
Says Pat ; She's mine, and may Heaven bless her! 
But, oh 1 
be me soul! she's like a 
bear 1 
He put his hand on the donkey's nose, 
With that, the ass began to bray ; 
Pat jumped up, and roared out: 
Who sarved me in such a 
way ? 
Whack fol de darral, cto. 
Pat ran home as fast as he could, 
At railway speed, or as fast, l'm sure; 
He never stopped a 
leg or foot, 
Until he came to Biddy's door. 
By that time, 'twas getting morning; 
Down on his knees he fell to pray; 
Crying: Let me in, my Biddy darling, 
I'm kilt, I'm murdered on the way! 
Whack fol de darral, 
He told her his story mighty civil, 
While she prepared a 
whiskey glass ; 
How he hugged and smugged the hairy divil; 
Go long, says she, 'twas Doran's ass I 
I 
know it was, my Biddy darling. 
They both got married the very next day, 
But he never got back his ould straw hat, 
That the jackass ate up, on the way.

JOCKEY HAT AND FEATHER. 
As I 
was walking out one day, 
Thinking of the weather, 
I 
saw a 
pair of roguish eyes, 
'Neath a 
hat and feather ; 
She looked at me, I 
locked at hor, 
It made my heart pit-pat, 
Then turning round she said to me, 
"How de you like my hat ? " 
cnonus. 
Oh 1 
I 
said its gay and pretty, too, 
They look well together, 
Those glossy curls and jockey lot, 
With a 
rcoster's feather. 
She wore a 
handsome broadcloth basque, 
Out the latest fashion, 
And flounces all around her dress, 
Made her lcok quite dashing; 
Her high-h.. clod boots as she walked on 
The pavement went pit-pat, 
ne'er forget the smile I 
saw, 
Beneath that jock ,y 
hat. 
Oh ! I 
said its gay, ikc, 
She kissed her hand and said " Au revoir," 
Then I 
was a 
goner, 
Before I'd time to say " Good-bye," 
She was round the corner. 
I 
tried that night, but could not sleep, 
So up in bed I 
sat, 
And right before my face I 
thought 
I 
saw that jockey hat. 
Oh 11

plan, 
That will render me as happy as a

And if you will allow me, I'll tell it to you now, 
For time you know is always on the wing. 
CHORUS. 
Work, boys, work, and be contented, 
As long as you've enough to buy a

The man, you may rely, will be wealthy by-and-by, 
If he'll only put his shoulder to the wheel. 
Will fretting make you fat ? No, there's nothing gained by 
that ? 
Assist yourself and fortune will help you; 
Tears are only vain, if defeated try again, 
You'll find it all the better if you do. 
Work, boys, work, &X. 
Discontented people say, all work and little play, 
Will make a

You can answer them and say, " Never work and always 
play, 
Will make him both a 
blockhead and a 
fool." 
Work, boys, work, &c. 
You'll enjoy a " quiet crust" more by " rubbing off the

You ask what makes this darkie weep, 
Why he like others am not gay, 
What causes the tear to flow down his cheek, 
From early morn till close of day.

For in my memory fresh it dwells, 
It will cause you all to drop a

While the birds were singing in the morning, 
And the myrtle and the ivy were in bloom, 
And the sun on the hill was a

It was then we laid her in the tomb. 
I 
never shall forget the day, 
That we together roamed the dells, 
I 
kissed her cheek, and named the day 
That I 
should marry Kitty Wells. 
But death came in my cabin door, 
And took from me my joy and pride, 
And when I 
found she was no more, 
I 
laid my banjo down and cried. 
'While the birds, &c. 
I 
often wish that I

Anti laid beside her in the tomb. 
The sorrow that bows down my head 
Is silent in the midnight gloom. 
The spring time has no charm for me, 
Though flowers are blooming in the dells, 
For that bright form I

'Tis the form of my sweet Kitty Wells.

ROCK ME TO SLEEP, MOTHER. 
Words by FLORENCE PERCY. 
Music by ERNEsT LESLIL 
Backward, turn backward, 0 
Time, in your flight I 
Make me a 
child again, just for to-night 
Mother, come back from the echoless shore, 
Take me again to your heart, as of yore. 
Kiss from my forehead the furrows of care, 
Smooth the few silver threads out of my hair, 
Over my slumbers yonr loving watch keep, 
Rock me to sleep, Mother, rock me to sleep 
CnonUS. 
Clasped to your heart, in a 
loving embrace, 
With your light lashes just sweeping .my face, 
Never hereafter to wake or to weep, 
Rock me to sleep, Mother, rock me to sleep I 
Over my heart, in the days that are flown, 
No love, like mother-love, ever has shone; 
No other worship abides and endures, 
Faithful, unselfish and patient, like yours. 
None, like a 
mother, can charm away pain 
From the sick soul and the world-weary brain; 
Slumber's soft calms o'er my heavy lids creep, 
Rock me to sleep, Mother, rock me to sleep 
Clasped to your heart, cte. 
Come, let your brown hair, just lighted with gold, 
Fall on your shoulders again, as of old; 
Let it drop over my forehead to-night, 
Shading my faint eyes away from the light, 
For, with. 
its sunny-edged shadows, once more, 
Haply will throng the sweet visions of yore, 
Lovingly, softly, its bright billows sweep, 
Rock me to sleep, Mother, rock me to sleep! 
Clasped to your heart, &e.
