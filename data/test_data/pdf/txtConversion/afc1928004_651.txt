Oh, I'm a 
lone wieldy, meself and my daughter; 
We live in a 
house where there's welcome galore; 
l5dy husband he formally carried up mortar, 
rom the ground to the third or fourth floor; 
When he died he will'd over the land and the shanty; 
His pipe and his stick, and his frieze overcoat; 
The pig and the goslins, the chickens so banty, 
And his favorite pet, oh, my buck Billy goat. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, hone; 
Come back to my bosom, my own darling Billy, 
Oh, oh, oh, oh hone; 
idy favorite pet, oh, my buck Billy goat. 
Wid horses he slept ev'ry night in the stable; 
He'd rise in the morn at the break o' the day; 
When breakfast was; ready he'd come to the table: 
Sure I 
never could drive him away; 
tie could butt down a 
fence oh so gentle and aisy; 
He'd stand near the pond for to see the ducks ,:leat., 
he'd climb o'er the hills, sure he never was lazy;

His whiskers were long like the Wandering Jewxnan; 
He ate up old hoop- skirts, newspapers and rags; 
When a 
kid he belonged to young Mary Ann Doolan; 
He would skip and sleep out on the flags; 
'Twas a 
blast from the quarry struck him on the shoulder, 
The morning my husband went out for to vote; 
He laid sick a 
bed from the fall of the boulder 
Did my favorite pet, oh, my buck Billy goat. 
Oh, oh, oh, etc., 
He'd fight like a 
trooper; his horus were like sabers; 
He'd bate all the goats for so many miles round; 
Sure he'd butt at a 
stranger, butt never a 
neighbor; 
Sure they could not take him to the pound; 
Oh, his right name was 'Willy, but I 
called him Billy; 
He was my companion; on him sure I'd doat; 
So fond of sunflowers and daffydown-dillies 
Was my favorite pet, oh. my buck Billy goat. 
Oh, ho, ho, etc., 
His white hairs were silken, they hung long and drooping; 
He traveled some time with Mike Regan's Big Nan; 
If a 
child in the neighborhood took on a 
crooping. 
He'd halt and he'd gaze like a 
man; 
All the dogs and the cats sure they'd never come near tam 
Wid his horns he would puck them a 
terrible smote; 
The long years and days it took me for to rear him, 
Oh, my favorite pet, oh, my buck Billy goat.

When first I 
saw in days of yore 
The moon behind the hill, 
Until my eyes could scarcely see 
The moon behind the hill, 
It brought me back my Mary's grave, 
The moon behind the hill, 
it brought me back my Mary's grave, 
The moon behind the hill. 
It brought me back the visions grand, 
That purpled boyhood's dreams, 
Its youthful loves, its happy lands, 
As bright as morning beams; 
It brought me back the spreading lea, 
The steeple and the mill, 
Until my eyes could scarcely see 
The moon behind the hill, 
Until my eyes could scarcely see 
The moon behind the bill. 
When first I 
saw, etc. 
It brought me back a 
mother's love, 
Until in accents wild, 
I 
pray'd her from her home above 
To guard her lonely child; 
It brought me one across the wave, 
To live in meni'ry still. 
It brought me back my Mary's grave, 
The moon behind the hill, 
It brought me back my Mary's grave,

CALL ME THINE OWN. 
Sung with great success by P. 0. Foy. 
Call me thine own, name fond, endearing, 
Like music sweet it falls on mine ear, 
Tells me of hope life's pathway cheering, 
Whispers of home, with thee ever near. 
Call me thine own, doubt would destroy, 
For only thro' faith are we secure; 
Making our hearts strong to endure 
What lies before us, sorrow or joy. 
Call me thine own, thine, thine alone, 
Name fond endearing, 
Call me thine own. 
Years may roll on, youth's dreams may leave us, 
Hopes faint and die that lighted our way; 
Trials may come, sorrows may grieve us, 
Friends may depart, or falsely betray. 
Call me thine own, all else may fail, 
With love in our hearts, Heaven still remains; 
Each bond with time fresh vigor gains, 
And o'er life's tempests love shall prevail. 
Call me thine own, thine, thine alone, 
Name most endearing, 
Call me thine own.

THE WAIERMILL. 
.c Recited by GUS W ILLIAMS. at TONY PASTOR=1; 
success. 
LISTEN to the waten»ill, through the livelong day, 
How the clicking of its wheel wears the hours away. 
Languidly the at:annul wind stirs the greenwood leaves ; 
From the fields the reapers sing, binding up the sheaves; 
And a 
proverb haunts my mind, as a 
spell is cast— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Autumn winds revive no more leaves that once are shed, 
'And the sickle cannot reap corn once gathered ; 
And the rippling stream flows on, tranquil, deep, and still, 
Never gliding 1:21ck again to the watennill. 
Truly speaks the proverb old, with a 
meaning vast— 
irill never grind with the water that is past 
J'nk"! the esson lo thyself, loving heart and true; 
Golden : -e.ars are fleeting by; youth is passing. toe ; 
Learn to make the most of life lose no happy day, 
Time will never bring thee back chances swept away; 
Leave no tender word un3aid, love, while love shall last-
The mill will never grind with the water that is pmt. 
Work while yet the daylight shines, man of strength and wilt, 
sever does the streamlet glide useless by the mill ; 
Wait not till to- morrow's sun beams, upon the way, 
All that though canst call thine own lies in thy— to- day ; 
Power, intellect, and health may not always last— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
AR !

Oh ! the good we might have done, lost without 1. sighl 
Love that we might once have saved by a

Thoughts conceived, but never penned, perishing, unheare 
Take the proverb to thine heart, take and hold it fast— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past.

A TRAMP. 
(A RECITATION.) 
La AwfalastlityCzwass BURKE, of CAMPBELL 
& 13Intcs, with trod 
success. 
Lemmt sit down a 
minute, a 
stone's got in my shoe; 
Dont you commence your cussin', I 
ain't done nothin' 
to you. 
res, I'm a 
tramp. 
What of it? 
Folks say we ain't 
no good, 
But tramps has to live, I 
reckon, though folks don't 
think we should. 
Once I 
was strong and handsome, had plenty of cash 
and clothes, 
That was afore I 
tippled and gin got into my nose. 
Down in Lehigh Valley me and people grew, 
I 
was a 
blacksmith, cap'en—yes, and a 
good one, too; 
Me and my wife and Nellie—Nellie was just sixteen, 
She was the pootiest creature the Valley had ever seen, 
Beaux? Why she had a 
dozen—Lad 'em from near 
and fur, 
But they were mostly farmers, ffone of 'em suited her. 
There was a 
city stranger, young, handsome and tall, 
Damn him—I 
wish I 
had him strangled egin that wall 
Me was the man for Nellie—she didn't know no M; 
Mother, she tried to stop it, but you know a 
young 
gal's will. 
Well, it's the same old story—common enough, you'll 
say, 
He was a 
soft-tongued devil, and got her to run away. 
More than a 
month after we heard from the poor 
young thing, 
He'd gone away and left her without a 
wedding ring. 
Back to her home we brought her, back to her moth-
er's side, 
with a 
raging fever—she fell at my feet and died. 
Frantic with shame and trouble, her mother began to 
sink, 
Dead—in less than a 
fortnight— that's when I 
took 
to drink. 
Gimme one glass, Curnel, and then I'll be on my way, 
I'll tramp ' till I 
find that scoundrel, U it takes 'till 
the Judgement DatY.

THE BABY'S GOT A TOOTH. 
As sung by JAMES 
The sun will soon refuse to shine, 
We're going to lose the moon, 
There will be a 
great catastrophe, 
'Twill happen very soon; 
The age of wonders has revived, 
Old age will turn to youth, 
And you'll agree that 1 
am right, 
When you have heard the tru th .

was suddenly awakened by a 
violent Budge from the .partner of my joys, w ho cri

George, George, dear, George, you brute, put your finger in 
the baby's dear little mouth." I 
did, and found a 
tooth. 
CHORUS: 
George, dear, George, dear, would you guess the truth? 
George, dear, the baby dear, bless the little youth; 
Do get up and light the fire, turn the gas a 
little higher, 
Run and tell my Aunt Maria, baby's got a 
tooth. 
Now, since that wonderful event, 
The house, both day and night, 
Is crowded with mammas, who come 
To wonder at the sight 
Of baby's wondrous primal tooth; 
To dance it on their knees, 
And hum their approbation 
Like a 
hive of busy bees. 
SPorn-N—Yes, they are all busy, some are busy eating, some 
are busy drinking, and all are busy singing: 
George, dear, etc. 
My wife will get up a 
party, 
In honor of the (lay; 
I 
dare not utter one protest, 
But must the piper pay. 
The house from top to bottom looks 
As i twere wrecked with bombs, 
Because the kid has pushed a 
bit 
Of ivory through his gums. 
She says I 
am a 
nasty brute, 
Without an ounce of sense, 
That I 
think not of the honor, 
But only the expense; 
But, if I

And when the time for breaking up the party did arrive, 
To see this little damsel home somehow I 
did contrive; 
But ere we parted at the door I 
boldly asked if I 
Might call and see her sometime when she gave me this reply, 
CHORUS 
Don't come in the morning, for that will be too soon, 
And never call to see me in the afternoon; 
Don't come in the evening and never call at night, 
But call at any other time and then you'll be all right. 
Bo strange an answer really I 
could not make out at all, 
Unless it was a 
gentle hint that I 
must never call; 
And yet I 
did not think she could treat me so unkind, 
For somehow she to favor me appeared to be inclined. 
go once again I 
asked her, but the answer was the same; 
And at that very moment to the door the servant came. 
Good-night, she said and vanished, did this darling little dear. 
And kept me standing with an answer ringing in my ear: 
Don't conic in the morning, etc. 
I 
strolled along and wandered what the dickens could she mean 
As all night long 
dreamt about that darling little queen; 
Bile more her answer came to me, which seemed to be absurd: 
But in the morning when I 
woke a 
happy thought occurred. 
She said if I 
would call at any time I 
should be all right, 
Except the morning, afternoon, the evening or at night; 
Any time that I 
could call was neither late nor soon; 
Of course you all have guessed by now she never more will 
say: 
Don't come in the morning, etc.

Cuckoo! cuckoo! 
I 
hear you call, I 
hear you call, \. 
Hear the cuckoo call. 
Oh! hear, he's calling now, 
Oh! sadly the cuckoo is calling now,".. 
I 
hear him far up in the ruins so gray; 
And softly the moonbeams are falling now,' 
O'er slumbering blossoms of May. 
Soft lilies and the rose. 
Wave in the valleys green, 
Sad spirits yearn for their lost love, 
While beautiful shamrock grows, 
Oh! sadly the cuckoo is calling now, 
I 
hear him far up in the ruins so gray! 
And softly the moonbeams are falling now, 
O'er slumbering blossoms of May. 
The birds do sing with a 
merry trill, 
Their glad notes sound clear through the green 
woodland bowers, 
But the cuckoo's song is so sad and still. 
It comes in the twilight's lone hours. 
Soft lilies, etc.

Publishing Co., 32 Beekman Street, New York. 
As sung by N D 
BARRY, with great success. 
I 
like honest pluck in this warfare of life, 
No matter whoever I 
meet ; 
I 
like a 
man boldly to say what he thinks, 
And not fill me with hollow deceit. 
It may not be pleasant at all times to hear 
The truth plainly told in your ear ; 
Yet ' tis better to know ou're prepar'd for the Nip or*, 
Than tremble like children with tear. 
CHORUS. 
I 
do like a 
man that will boldly stand up, 
And tell me at once what he feels, 
r 
can fight with the lion that roars in my face, 
But I 
can't bear a 
cur at my, heels. 
like to be told of my faults like a 
man, 
And I 
ne'er knew the man who had none ; 
Para words may be used, yet I 
like him the most 
Who has pluck all my faults to make known. 
If wrong I 
can cure the foul slander at once, 
And destroy every venomous part ; 
Vet I 
reel when a 
Judas: who smiles in my face, 
Gives a 
stab at my back in the dark. 
I 
do like a 
man 
So behind a 
man's back always mind what you say, 
If you can't do him no good, do him no harm; 
If you don't like back-biting, don t 
do it yourself, 
And your good name will spread like a 
charm. 
We all have to live so let's try and make life 
A r.,,d open field for the race, 
And Vi you have cause of complaint ' gainst man, 
C.f.'t '

I 
grew to be a

And on the road to ruin I 
was bent.

In her home of flowers. 
You'll discover how to love her 
If you only try; 
You'll be given gleams of heaven 
If you catch her eye; 
Like the stars that gleam and glistui 
In the azure sky, 
When she speaks the angels listen 
As they pass her by.
