Ant—" Croquet." 
I 
suppose you all have heard of a 
funny little game, 
That has corhe out here of late in New York; 
The sports have all gone cranky, and have got it on 
the brain, 
And about it 'round the city they all talk. 
They play it night and day, spend the last cent they 
have got, 
And " Keno !" you will hear them loudly shout; 
But it's my opinion now, since Kelso made the raid, 
That the little game of Keno is played out. 
CHORUS. 
Keno! Keno! that is now played out, 
Keno! Keno! yes, without a 
doubt; 
I've played it all the night, had my pockets emptied 
quite, 
At that awful funny game of Keno 
T'other night while walking out, a 
friend of mine I 
met, 
Who asked me if I 
wouldn't go and play; 
Of course I 
then consented, for I knew no better 
then, 
And we started for a 
game up on Broadway. 
DICK WEAVER'S 
We soon reached the place, and admittance we gained, 
And at Keno then we both began to play, 
But I 
very soon found out, to my sorrow and sm 
prise, 
That the little game of Keno didn't pay. (Ono.) 
We won a " pot" or two, but we lost it all again, 
And besides we lost a 
many dollar more; 
When we heard a 
feller say," Cheese it, Cully, here's 
the caps 1" 
And we saw a 
dozen cops come in the door. 
They collared us so quick, marched us to the station-
house, 
Ten dollars in the morn we had to pay; 
Bo I 
came to the conclusion that it was a 
losing game, 
And resolved no more at Keno I 
should play.

The Fascinating Swell. 
SUNG BY HARRY HOLMES, THE GREAT SENSATION COMIC. 
Oh, here I 
am again, my boys, 
Just take a 
look at me; 
A nobby, fascinating swell, 
So jolly and so free. 
The pet of all the girls am I, 
As any one can tell, 
Indeed they've all gone crazy o'er 
This fascinating swell. 
CHORUS. 
For they can't resist my figure, boys, 
It's the style that suits so well, 
The girls are growing crazy o'er 
This fascinating swell. 
GREAT KENO SONGSTER. 
If on Broadway I 
chance to go, 
To take a 
little walk, 
The ladies all stare at me so, 
And then commence to talk. 
They smile and say, " Oh, ain't he sweet ?" 
And then each charming belle 
Will heave a 
sigh as she passes by 
This fascinating swell. (Cnoitus.) 
At all the balls and parties 
I 
am always to be found, 
For where the girls do congregate 
You'll find me, I'll be bound. 
And there I 
trip the light fantastic 
With some charming belle, 
Who talks sweet, loving nonsense to 
This fascinating swell. 
(CH0Rus.) 
But soon a 
married man I'll be, 
For Vother day as I 
Was walking out I 
chanced to see 
A pretty girl go by. 
She winked at me, I 
winked at her, 
Then straight in love she fell 
With Charles Augustus Fitz de Gray, 
The fascinating swell.

The other girls have beaus in scores, 
But all alone I 
sigh, 
Although I'm nearly sweet sixteen, 
Yet not a 
beau have I. 
CHORUS. 
Indeed it is a 
candid fact, 
An old maid yet I'll die, 
For though I'm nearly sweet sixteen, 
Yet not a 
beau have I. 
And why I 
cannot catch a 
beau 
I 
really cannot tell, 
For when they conic to visit me 
I 
always treat them well ; 
I 
laugh, and chat, and sing, and play, 
To please them all I 
try, 
But though I'm nearly sweet sixteen, 
Yet not a 
beau have I. (Cuonus.) 
There's sister May— I've heard her say 
She's got a 
half a 
score, 
But still she is not satisfied, 
She always cries for more. 
Poor little nic's left all alone— 
I've half a 
mind to cry, 
For though I'm nearly sweet sixteen, 
Yet not a 
beau have I. (Cnonus.) 
Ah, well, I 
think I'll let them go, 
They're quite too hard to please; 
I'll let them go, and set.le down, 
And live a 
life of ease. 
Oh, yes, indeed, I'll let them go, 
To please them I'll not try, 
For here I'm nearly sw(et sixteen, 
Yet not a

When Daylight was yet Sleeping un-
der the Billow. 
SUNG BY DICK WEAVER. 
AIR-fatty of Coleraine. 
When daylight was yet sleeping under the billow, 
And stars in the heavens still lingering shone, 
Young Kitty, all blushing rose up from her pillow, 
The last time she e'er was to press it alone ; 
For the youth whom she treasured her heart and her 
soul in, 
hat! promised to link the last tie before noon, 
And when once the young heart of a 
maiden is stolen, 
The maiden herself will start after it soon. 
As she looked in the glass which a 
woman ne'er 
misses, 
Nor ever wants time for a 
sly glance or two, 
A 
butterfly, fresh from the night-flower's kisses, 
Flew o'er the mirror and shaded her view ; 
Enraged with the insect for hiding her graces, 
She brushed him—he fell, alas I 
never to rise; 
" 
Ah I 
such," said the girl, " is the pride of our faces, 
For which the soul's innocence too often dies." 
'While she stole through the garden where heart'seasc 
was growing, 
She culled some, and kissed off its night-fallen dew, 
And a 
rose further on looked so tempting and glowing, 
That, spite of her haste, she must gather it, too. 
But while o'er the roses too carelessly leaning, 
Her zone flew in two and the hearesease was lost; 
" 
Ah I 
this means," said the girl, (and she sighed at 
its meaning,) 
" 
That love is scarce worth the repose it will cost."

tamed from DICK NN kAVER, No. 145 Eighth Av., New York. 
Tho' the last glimpse of Erin with sorrow I 
see, 
Yet wherever thou art shall seem Erin to me ! 
In exile thy bosom shall still be my home, 
And thine eyes make my climate wherever we roam. 
To the gloom of some desert or far-distant shore, 
Where the eye of the stranger can haunt us no more, 
I 
will fly with my Colleen, and think the rough wind 
Less rude than the foes we leave frowning behind. 
And I'll gaze on thy gold hair, as graceful it wreathes, 
And hang o'er thy soft harp, as wildly it breathes, 
Nor dread that the cold hearted Saxon will tear 
One chord from that harp or one lock from that hair.

Good-evening, my friends, I'd have you to know

Now the bawling and shouting of poor Jeremiah 
Caused Sophia to fall as she stood on the wire, 
Her little foot slipped and so downward she fell, 
And as she descended poor Jerry did yell: (Ono.) 
Now Sophia broke her fall, and did so repeat, 
When showers of bouquets they fell at her feet, 
They turned out poor Jerry, and as he retreated, 
This is the chorus the company repeated: 
Look where he goes, poor Jeremiah,

Let Erin remember the days of old, 
Ere her faithless sons betrayed her, 
When Malachi wore the collar of gold, 
Which he won from her proud invader; 
When her kings, with standards of green unfurled. 
Led the red branch knights to danger, 
Ere the emerald gem of the western world 
Was set in the crown of a 
stranger. 
On Lough Neagh's bank as the fisherman strays, 
When the clear, cold eve's declining, 
He sees the round towers of other days 
In the wave beneath him shining. 
Thus memory often in dreatr.s sublime, 
Catch a 
glimpse of the days that are over, 
Thus sighing look through the waves of time, 
For the long- faded glories they cover.

Golden-Haired Nell. 
SONG AND DANCE. 
WRITTEN AND SUNG BY DICK WEAVER. 
Down in the valley, close by the dell, 
Lives a 
little maiden, golden-haired Nell, 
Sweet as a 
daisy, winsome and bright, 
Singing so gayly from morning till night. 
Cheeks just as red as the roses of June, 
Sweet little, dear little belle, 
Her voice is as sweet as the nightingale's tune, 
Dear little golden-haired Nell. 
C 
Golden- haired Nell, sweet little belle, 
how I 
adore her, words cannot tell; 
Come to me, darling, never to part, 
Sweet little golden-haired queen of my heart. 
Straying one day by a 
clear running stream, 
I 
first met this maiden—I 
thought ' twas a 
dream, 
For she burst on my sight like a 
vision so rare, 
I 
thought 'twas an angel I 
saw standing there. 
But the smile that she gave from her blue, roguish 
eyes 
Such delusions as those did dispel ; 
And I 
found to my joy I 
had gained a 
rich prize 
In my sweet little golden-haired Nell. (CnoItus.) 
Last Sunday night, as we roamed through the dell, 
I 
whispered a 
something so softly to Nell— 
What it was I 
whispered I 
leave you to guess, 
But the answer so shyly she made me was " Yes." 
And now when the springtime comes round again, 
And the song-birds warble in the dell, 
I'll be married in the little brown church 'neath the 
hill, 
To my sweet little golden-haired Nell. (thronus.)

The Gal that Peddled Tripe. 
BY DICK WEAVER. 
I 
pretty damsel once I 
knew, 
She lived in Baxter street, 
Her eyes were bright, complexion light, 
She'd pretty little feet; 
With pearly teeth and dimpled chin, 
And lips like cherries ripe, 
She'd a 
stall in Fulton Market, where 
She used to peddle tripe_ 
CHORUS.

Her name was Sarah Angeline, 
Her cheeks were round and fair, 
Her eyes did shine like diamonds, 
And she'd pretty golden hair. 
In business she did very well; 
And every thing looked gay, 
Till a 
lawyer's clerk, on pleasure bent, 
Did happen down that way; 
His office was in Maiden Lane, 
His name was Mr. Snipe, 
lie fell in love right then and there, 
With the gal that peddled tripe. (C no.) 
lie offered her his heart and hand. 
And said, " My dearest maid, 
If you love me as I 
love you, 
Our love will never fade ; 
Then say the word, my dearest one, 
Wilt thou be Mrs. Snipe 
No more you'll live in Baxter street, 
No more you'll peddle tripe." (Cno.) 
She faintly murmured, " Yes: sir-ee," 
That filled him with delight,

The market-stall Was quickly closed, 
They married were that night. 
But fate did frown upon the pair— 
At least it did on Snipe, 
For he did lose his life that night, 
By the too free use of " tripe." (Cnowes.) 
When Sarah heard the awful news, 
Her heart sunk in despair, 
She loudly did bewail her fate, 
And tear her pretty hair ; 
But soon her grief did pass away, 
She soon forgot poor Snipe, 
And went right back to the market, 
Where still she peddles tripe. (Cnonus.)

Of a 
long night of bondage thy spirit appears I 
Din! oh, Erin ! thus bright through the tears 
Of a

The nations have fallen, but thou still art young, 
Thy sun is but rising when others' are set ; 
And though slavery's cloud o'er thy morning bath hung, 
The full noon of freedom shall beam 'round thee yet.

Thy star will shine out when the proudest shall fade!

But though I've grown to man's estate—

But it hasn't happened yet. 
Now there's the Nathan murder, 
That took place some time ago, 
The full particulars of which 
I'm sure you all do know. 
It caused a 
great excitement, 
And a 
great deal of regret— 
They said they'd catch the murderer, 
But it hasn't happened yet. 
Then there's the great East River Bridge, 
Of that you all have beard, 
The way they've gone to work on that 
Is really quite absurd; 
Some months ago the job commenced, 
The men to work were set, 
But though they promised us a 
bridge, 
It hasn't happened yet. 
The Spaniards have been making war 
'Gainst Cuba, as you know, 
But little Cuba still holds out

Paddy McCaffrey's Cow. 
WRITTEN AND SUNG BY DICK WEAVER WITII IMMENSE 
SUCCESS. 
Ain—Darling Old Stick. 
One Paddy McCaffrey, a 
tight Irish lad, 
Was born in the county of Ballynafad; 
There he spent his young days and to manhood did 
grow, 
And came to America sometime ago; 
Where he settled down nicely and nately, 
And good luck attended him greatly, 
But one trouble vexed him complately, 
'Twas the want of a 
cow to give milk. 
So he straightway consulted his wife, Peggy Ann, 
A nate little girl from the county Covan, 
Who said that her milk she must have anyhow, 
So he made up his mind that he'd buy him a 
cow. 
So to buy one he set off so gayly, 
Twirling his blackthorn shillaly, 
When he met on the road farmer Bailey, 
A thoroughbred Yankee, so cute. 
Good - evening, friend Bailey," bold Patrick then 
said, 
And by way of respect touched the hat on
- his bead, 
" 
Can you tell me," he asked, as he made him a 
bow, 
" 
Where you think I'll be able to buy me a 
cow ?" 
" 
A cow ?" said the ,farmer; " I 
do, Pat, 
For sure it's myself 'that owns two, Pat, 
And one of them I'll sell to you, Pat, 
That is, if you pay me my price." 
Well they haggled awhile and a 
bargain soon made, 
Then the price of the cow to the farmer he paid; •

DICK WEAVER'S 
Said Pat, " She's a 
very fine baste, I 
allow, 
'Won't Peggy be pl'ased when she sees my fine cow? 
And fresh rallk have every day, sirs, 
And ' pon my soul that will be gay, sirs." 
So singing so gay all the way, sirs, 
lie drove home his newly-bought cow. 
He arrived at his house, met his wife at the door, 
Who said such a 
beauty she'd ne'er seen before; 
" 
Arrabl where did you buy her ?" said Peggy, so 
gayly. 
"I bought her," said Paddy, " of old farmer Bailey." 
Then Peggy stared at him in wonder, 
And said, " Sure you've made a 
big blunder, 
That Protestant thief 1 
blood and thunder! 
Sure, Pat, it's a 
Protestant cowl" 
" 
Hould aisy," said Paddy, " and I'll soon fix that, 
Go into the house now and mind what you're at, 
And some holy water bring here—hurry, now, 
And, faith, I'll soon make her a 
Catholic cow!" 
So Peggy went in in hot haste, sirs, 
Resolving that no time she'd waste, sirs, 
But to christen the Protestant baste, sirs, 
And make her a 
Catholic cow. 
But she brought out a 
bottle of vitriol instead, 
Which Pat began pouring upon the cow's head, 
And making the sign of the cross as he poured, 
When all of a 
sudden the cow loudly roared. 
For the vitriol her flesh began burning, 
And she commenced twisting and turning, 
As though the idea she were spurning, 
Then madly she dashed down the road. 
They watched the old cow till she ran out of sight, 
Not knowing the cause of the creature's affright,

Then turne'd tb each other with faces quite blue, 
Both thinking the cow was a 
Protestant true. 
Said Peggy, " Sure, there's something wrong in 
her; 
Oh, my! ain't the Protestant strong in her !" 
Said Paddy, " The divel go 'long wid her 
She's Protestant to the backbone !"

You may talk of your girls, of your blondes and bru-

Of your girls with their sweet golden hair, sirs, 
You may praise them by day, you may praise them 
by night, 
And sing of their virtues so rare, sirs ; 
As for me, I'll now sing of a 
sweet little pet, 
Her name it is Sally Ann Warner, 
She's the sweetest young girl that I

Is that dear little girl ' round the corner. 
We met on the avenue one Monday night, 
The stars were out shining so brightly ; 
I 
paused, said " Good-evening, how are you, my dear ?" 
She bowed as she tripped past me lightly. 
I 
soon gained her side and I 
offered my arm, 
She took it—then I 
was a

With heart beating fast, up the street then I 
passed, 
With that dear little girl 'round the corner. 
I 
asked her to dine and she didn't refuse— 
For oysters and wine then we went, sirs, 
And the way she ate oysters and drank sherry wine, 
'Pon my word, it near made me repent, sirs. 
Two bottles of sherry, four stews and a 
raw, 
And a 
hot whisky punch as a 
warmer; 
Don't you think that she's got a 
real good appetite? 
This dear little girl 'round the corner. 
Having eaten so much that she couldn't eat more, 
We rose from our sets and departed ;

We chatted on pleasantly all the way home— 
Thinks I 
to myself, I'm a 
goner, 
For she's quite won my heart and I'll ne'er get it 
back, 
From that dear little girl 'round the corner. 
Her house we soon reached—up the stairs then we 
ran, 
She opened the door and went in, sirs, 
When a fellow sprung out and caught me by the 
throat, 
And to knock me around did begin, sirs. 
As he kicked me doWn stairs he bawled out, " That's 
my wife! 
If you do not clear out you're a 
goner !" 
Then I 
heard some one say, " Cully, how's that for 
high?" 
'Twas that mean little girl 'round the corner. 
Bashful Young Bachelor. 
WRITTEN AND SUNG BY DICK WEAVER. 
In Brooklyn, that city right over the river, 
There once lived a modest and bashful young 
man, 
lie was handsome and rich, and was just turning 
thirty, 
All the girls in the neighborhood after him ran ; 
But with all their fine talk and their love-making 
nonsense, 
They'd frighten him so not a 
word could he say, 
But he'd stammer and stutter, not a 
word could he 
utter, 
This bashful young bachelor over the way. 
22 
DICK WEAVER'S 
He was sought for by mothers with elderly daugh-
ters, 
By spinsters who wanted to settle in life ; 
His relations would all throw out hints to him 
gently. 
How he'd better be thinking of taking a 
wife. 
But he told them he never would dare pop the ques-
tion, 
He thought he'd forever a 
single man stay, 
He never could ask any lady to marry, 
This bashful young bachelor over the way. 
He vowed and declared that the ladies, dear crea-
tures, 
Bewildered him so when they happened to meet, 
That he hardly could tell 
if 
he had hi S 
right 
senses, 
If he stood on his head or he stood on his 
feet. 
He said that he never could tell of the reason 
Why the ladies he shunned—but be that as it 
may, 
He was not to be coaxed into popping the ques-
tion, 
This bashful young bachelor over the way. 
But all things must end either sooner or later, 
'Twas so in the case of my modest young friend, 
For a 
crusty old maid on the wrong side of forty 
Soon brought all his bachelor days to an end. 
She hitched on his " knibbs " and she'd take no re-
fusal, 
She frightened him so not a 
word could he say; 
And in less than a 
week she in triumph did marry 
This bashful young bachelor over the way.

Charming Young Widow in Black.

Ant- 0 
harming Young Widow I 
met on the Train. 
As I 
was on,t walking one evening last summer, 
A handsome young lady I 
happened to meet, 
She was dressed up in black, and looked very charm-
ing, 
As onward she tripped it down through Chatham 
street. 
And as it was raining I 
ventured to ask her 
If she'd not like to have me to call for a 
hack; 
She smiled, oh, so sweetly, and said, " I'd be thankful," 
Did this handsome young widow I 
met dressed in 
black. 
For a 
carriage I 
went, and I 
found one quite easy, 
And soon we were seated so nicely inside ; 
I 
thought as I 
gazed on her beautiful features, 
How happy I'd feel then if she were my bride. 
So I 
made up my mind that I'd pay her attention, 
In popping the question I 
would not be slack; 
She quite won my heart with her innocent prattle, 
Did this charming young widow I 
met dressed in 
black. 
I 
asked her the reason why she was in mourning, 
She replied, " For my husband," in accents so wild, 
Said she, " He was killed by a 
railroad collision, 
And has left me alone with a 
two year old child; 
For his horrible fate I 
am sadly bewailing, 
And my heart feels as though it were ready to 
crack; 
This world is all dark since my darling has left me I" 
Said this charming young widow I 
met dressed in 
black. 
24 
DICK WEAVER'S 
When her grief had subsided, I 
asked her politely, 
To go to a 
saloon and have oysters and wine; 
She said she'd be glad to accept of my kindness, 
So to Taylor's we went then and sat down to dine. 
And the way that she stowed away wine, cake and 
punches, 
I 
tell you, my friends, I 
was taken aback ; 
I 
really ne'er thought she was such a 
strong feeder, 
This handsome young widow I met dressed in 
black. 
The bill being paid then we sallied out gayly, 
Arm in arm through the streets then we wended 
our way, 
Till to Stewart's we came, where she made ,large pur 
chases, 
Of silks, shawls and laces, for which I 
did pay. 
I 
thought that the widow was drawing it heavy, 
But still on the darling I 
could not go back; 
But thinks I, when we're married I'll soon stop the 
.shopping 
Of this handsome young widow I met dressed in 
black. 
We soon reached her house and she asked me to 
enter, 
I 
did, but oh my! what a 
sight met my view; 
'Twas a 
big, burly ruffian, who sprung at me fiercely, 
And said, " I've been looking a 
long time for 
you!" 
To beat and to pound me he then did commence, sirs, 
Down four flights of stairs I 
was thrown on my 
back, 
While some one above cried, " How are you, spooney ?" 
'Twas that handsome young widow I 
met dressed 
in black.

Ant—Big Sunflower. 
Now, white folks, listen while I 
sing 
Of a 
nice young radish-girl; 
Her cheeks were red, her eyes were black, 
And her hair was made to curl. 
Her maiden name was Sarah Jane, 
Her dad's was Hans Van Stark, 
He owned a 
great big radish-farm 
Up near the Central Park. 
CHORUS. 
Oh 1 
she was as pretty as the roses of June, 
With a 
step like a 
fawn, light and airy, 
She was known far and wide as the prettiest of girls, 
This pretty little radish-girl, Sary. 
Every morning in the summertime, 
Before the day would dawn, 
With a 
basketful of radishes, 
' 
To the city she'd be gone: 
And there her flute-like voice you'd hear, 
On business quite intent, 
Cry out so loud, " Fresh radishes, 
Two bunches for a 
cent!" ( CuoRus.) 
Now Sarah Jane was deep in love 
With a 
very nice young man, 
He used to peddle porgies, and 
His name was " Cranky Dan." 
That his parents were respectable 
I 
think there's ample proof, 
For in Rue de Baxter they did dwell, 
On the first floor near the roof. (Cm.)

26 
DICK WEAVER'S 
Now Sarah Jane, at Dan's request, 
Had named the happy day 
When he could claim her as his bride, 
And carry her away; 
But old Van Stark heard of their plans, 
And swore an awful oath 
That he would separate the pair, 
Or else he'd kill them both. 
(CHORUS.) 
That night he told sweet Sarah Jane 
That she must shake poor Dan; 
The news it did affect her so, 
To " beller " she began. 
He heeded not her sobs and tears, 
He thought not of her pain, 
But he said no man that peddled fish 
Could wed his Sarah Jane. 
(CHORUS.) 
Her spirits sunk beneath the weight, 
She resolved on suicide, 
Then she ate ten pounds of horse-shoe nails, 
And laid right down and died. 
When " Cranky " heard of her awful fate, 
He nearly lost his breath, 
He fell thro' the seat of his skin-tight pants, 
And choked himself to death. (CHoRus.)

He was climbing so bould wid a 
hod on his shoulder, 
When he fell on his head, and his neck he broke 
clan e ; 
Now I've come out to tell of the glorious row that 
Took place at the wake of Long Barney McShane. 
At his house all his friends and relations assimbled, 
'Twas in Mulberry street, up six flight of stairs, 
Poor Barney was there, wid his best suit of clothes on, 
Laid out for the wake upon three or four chairs. 
Poor widow McShane was there crying so hearty, 
At the thoughts of poor Barney she'd ne'er see 
again, 
There was laughing and crying, and sobbing and 
sighing, 
All at once at the'wake of Long Barney McShane. 
There was Terry O'Rann and his cousin, Tim Dooley, 
And big Biddy Welsh and young Danny O'Shea, 
There was Barney's young brother, his father and 
mother, 
And Conny O'Reagan and Biddy McGee. 
Paddy Sheehan was there wid his goold watch, sirs, 
And a 
fine yaller duster, so nate and so cane, 
And his seven big brothers from Ireland came over 
To dance at the wake of Long Barney McShane 
There was bold Patsey Fagan and Shamus O'Brien, 
And blind piper Tim and old Carroty Ned, 
There was Judy McCann wid a 
big waterfall 
Stuck up all so grand on the back of her head. 
Larry Murphy was there wid his colleen, young 
Molly, 
Tom Donnelly, too, and young Billy McClane, 
And a 
score or two more I 
can hardly remimber, 
Were there at the wake of Long Barney McShane.

On one side of the room all the ladies were seated, 
The gents took their seats on the other, of course, 
Then Pat Sheehan requested Miss Molly to sing, sirs, 
But she vowed she could not, she was rather too 
hoarse. 
Then Paddy got vexed, and he said she was sham-
ming, 
Larry Murphy jumped up and said, " What dO you 
mane ?" 
By way of reply, Paddy hit him a 
skelt, sirs, 
That opened the wake of Long Barney McShane. 
Then Larry called loud on his party to back him, 
He said he was struck in the wrong, he was sure; 
Then Danny O'Shea and the most of the party 
Jumped up at the call and leaped out on the flure. 
Then Paddy's big brothers, wid their seven stout 
blackthorns, 
Jumped up and cried out, " Is it 
fight that you 
mane ?" 
In less than a 
minute they were at it quite hearty, 
Breaking skulls at the wake of Long Barney Mc-
Shane. 
When the row commenced all the ladies departed, 
And the brothers and Pat soon the men put to 
flight; 
But to crown all the fun, wid themselves soon they 
quarreled, 
And it broke out ere long in a 
family fight. 
In the midst of the row the corpse was turned over, 
'Twas thrown down the stairs and then thrown Op 
again, 
The coffin was broke, divel a 
thing was left whole, 
sirs, 
That ended the wake of Long Barney McShane.

When first we chanced to meet, 
Where she cooked fish-halls and oyster stew's, 
'Twas down in Chatham street.

Oh, Rose, I'll ne'er forget you, 
Nor that pretty puggy nose,

Deceiving fish-ball Rose.

To see my lovely Rose, 
She's got such pretty curly hair, 
And such a

Her mouth is full ten inches wide, 
Her foot's as wide again ; 
At cooking fish-balls she's a

She's got it on de brain. (Cnonus.) 
'Twas on one Sunday evening, 
I 
drove out for a

In a

With my Rosey by my side;

That my future wife she'd be, 
Then de niggers all got jealous, 
But dat did not trouble me. (Cnonus.)

Said this girl with the domino mask. (Cno.) 
I 
asked her then to show her face, 
But that she would not do, 
"For," said she, " my husband's here to-night, 
And he might see it too; 
And I 
wouldn't like to have him know 
That I 
am here at all, 
For he thinks that I 
am safe at home,

We sat and talked, but what we said 
I'm sure I

And then you know you'll see my face," 
Said this girl with the domino mask. (Ciro.)

Then for my love I

His melodious voice you could hear every night, 
Crying out, " Hurry up! now's your time 
Shoe- blacking, shoe-laces and matches, 
give 
Two boxes to you for a 
dime I" 
This lumber merchant had fourteen sons, 
Of daughters he had about eight, 
In the lumber trade he had put them all, 
Excepting his daughter Kate. 
She told the old man if he put her at that, 
She'd kick up and spoil all his plans, 
So to Catherine Market he sent her then, 
To learn how to open clams. 
At the oyster stand where Kitty did work, 
Was a 
gallus young oyster-boy; 
Admired he was by all of the girls, 
And his name was Sammy McCoy. 
And he and Kitty soon got on nice, 
She thought a 
great deal of Sam, 
For he was the one that showed her how 
To open her very first clam. 
But the love of Kate for the oyster-boy 
Was not very- strong or true, 
For she soon hitched in with a 
charcoal man, 
Whose name was Jimmy McCue. 
The way he was used made Sam feel sore, 
Loud curses he lahl on the pair, 
And he said if she didn't come hack right away, 
That he'd do something bad to get square. 
But Charcoal Jimmy he stuck to Kate, 
And Kitty she stuck to him, 
Then Sammy McCoy, with an oyster-knife, 
Went looking for Charcoal Jim. 
But Kitty and Jim soon heard of the news, 
Which made them soon take to their heels, 
SO 
to Russian Adnevica then they went, 
To learn haw to fish for seals. 
When the news was brought to the oyster-boy, 
He knew not what to do, 
So he thought he would try to ease his mind 
By eating an oyster stew. 
That oyster stew was the cause of his death, 
He was choked by a 
piece of a 
shell, 
And that was the last of the oyster-boy, 
For now he has gone to—Hoboken.

The neighbors all laughed at.her folly, 
And wanted to coax her away,

But she paid no attention whatever, 
But sat herself down on the floor, 
As though she would sit there forever,

At last they convinced the dear creature 
That what we were doing was right, 
And growling, she tock Iler departure, 
And left us alone for the night.

And see that you take nothing more;

With hair in curl, 
Whose acquaintance I

She'd auburn hair,

Her waist was small, 
But best of all 
Were her pretty little feet.

In love I

We onward walked, 
And gayly talked 
About the heat and rain; 
It looks absurd, 
But 'pon my word, 
She fairly turned my brain; 
She talked so gay, 
As on Broadway 
We slowly sauntered down, 
I 
found my heart 
From me did part, 
It went with Polly Brown. (Cuo.)

By another in my love I've been supplanted, 
And I 
find no peace nor quiet wherever I 
go, 
By the memory of that false one I 
am haunted. 
Oh, she was charming, young and fair, with hair of 
golden hue, 
She told me that she loved me, but I 
found it wasn't 
true; 
When dressed up in her Sunday clothes how pretty 
she did look, 
But alas! she did desert me for a 
nasty pastry-cook.

Oh, pretty Jemima Hopkins, the sweetest girl in town, 
She's prettier than a

But she ran away and left me for a

Who kept a 
shop 'way over in the Bowery. 
Tile Way I've been deluded by this false and fickle maid 
Is a 
caution to the young men of the city, 
For she lured me on with promises, with my affections 
played, 
And left me broken-hearted, more's the pity.

Were I

Suffice to say I'm broken both in heart and pocket too, 
I'm wandering on, quite sick of life, not knowing 
what to do. - (Caonus.) 
On every pleasant afternoon the both of us would go, 
Out riding to the Central Park so flowery, 
And returning in the evening, with spirits all aglow, 
We'd always stop at Brown's Shop in the Bowery. 
And there on cookies, cakes and tarts, ice-cream and 
waffles too, 
She'd make a 
meal and put away of oyster pies a 
few; 
While I, blind fool, could not perceive the fond and 
loving look, 
And tender smile she always gave to Brown, the pas-
try-cook. (Cuottus.) 
At last I 
did perceive things weren't altogether right, 
And saw ' twas foolish longer then to tarry, 
So I 
quickly made my mind up, and on that very night 
I 
asked Jetnima dear if she would marry. 
But, oh! imagine my surprise, my deep despair and 
woe, 
When, instead qf saying " yes " at once, she quickly 
answered " No!" 
She told me that with love on me she never could 
look, 
For she had given all she had to Brown, the pastry.

And got in such a 
jolly row. 
I'm just as drunk as I

So, Johnny, heed what I

So put me in my little bed. 
Oh, what did that old buffer say 
Who tried to have me taken in ? 
He told the " coppers " I 
was drunk, 
And said that I 
was full of gin. 
I 
can't forget the row we had, 
I 
tried to stand him on his head; 
But now I 
want to take a 
snooze, 
So put me in my little bed. (CnoRus.) 
Dear Johnny, come and take a 
drink, 
Now, ere I 
lay me down to rest; 
Just call for what you think you'd like, 
But I 
think milk punch is the best. 
It's what I've drank the whole day long, 
And now it's got up in my head ; 
So gently take me home, dear Johnny, 
And put me in my little bed.

Ant— Captain with his Whiskers. 
As the paper I 
was reading the other afternoOn, 
I 
spied an advertisement that caught my eye quite 
soon; 
It was calling the attention of those who wished to 
know 
Of the present, past and future;' how it read I'll 
quickly show. 
It commenced in great big letters,” Madame Perriggo, 
the wise, 
Can correctly tell your fortunes by the stars up in 
the sides; 
She can tell of absent loved ones,, how a 
fortune you 
can make, 
And she can tell you truly what trade to undertake. 
She can cure all kinds of sickness, tells lucky num-
bers too, 
And correctly she can tell you how your sweetheart 
you should woo; 
She can give you informatidn on 'most anything you 
wish, 
From telling how to win at cards to peddling clams 
and fish. 
She reveals to you the secrets no mortal ever knew, 
'Tis perfectly astonishing to see all she can do; 
She causes speedy marriages with those whom we 
love best, 
And makes up lovers' quarrels along, with all the 
rest." 
Then it said, " Young men and ladies, who .your bet-

I 
can send their pictures to you, one dollar is thejee ; 
By sending me your age and hight, and a 
small lock 
of your hair, , 
I 
can tell the day you'll marry "—which I 
thought 
was very fair. 
So I 
straightway wrote a 
letter, which I 
sent to Ma-
dame P., 
And I 
told her I 
was anxious my future wife to see; 
I 
told her answer quickly, not to keep me in suspense, 
Inclosed I 
sent a 
dollar bill to cover the expense. 
Then patiently I 
waited, for I 
thought she would not 
fail 
To send an answer to me by the next return of mail; 
But days and weeks have glided by, but still I 
look 
in vain, 
I'll never hear of Madame, or my dollar bill again. 
But I 
have learnt a 
lesson that will last me all my 
life, 
For I 
vow I'll never try again to see my future wife; 
And of fortune•telling madames I 
want no more to

DICK WEAVER'S 
Is simply a 
damsel with fair golden hair; 
The name of this fairy is sweet little Mary, 
Sweet Mary, the wet nurse of Washington Square. 
One day in the Square, sir, while taking the air, sir, 
The door being open, I 
quickly passed through; 
My heart with love itchin', I 
went to the kitchen, 
When, Lord ! what a spectacle there met my 
. view I 
My love was deep-seated, but what my eyes greeted 
Soon turned all that love into rage and despair; 
For there at his ease, man, a 
great big policeman 
Sat hugging the wet nurse of Washington Square. 
For them I 
did jump, sir, when, Lord I 
what a 
thump, 
sir, 
This policeman gave me then on my poor head 1 
Then off to the station, without hesitation, 
He quickly did run me, and I 
nearly dead. 
And there he abused me, and foully ill used me, 
And called me hard names, which of course wasn't 
fair; 
And then to my grief, sir, swore I 
was a 
thief, sir, 
And so did the wet nurse of Washington Square! 
Next morn to the court, sir, I 
quickly was brought, 
With'very good prospects o
rf 
going to jail, 
But a 
friend who had heard of my troubles was there, 
sir, 
And very soon had me released upon bail. 
I 
quickly'departed, and for my home started, 
Quite cured of my folly for damsels so fair, 
They're all so deceiving, they're past all believing, 
They're all 
like the wet nurse of Washington

And some to laugh began, 
But said he, " I

Said he, " I 
am acquainted with 
And well know Mister Brown, 
But then you cannot see him now,

While the sights to me he'd show. 
Of course I 
gave him my consent, 
For I 
well liked the plan, 
So to see the sights I 
then did go, 
With this very polite young man. (Cno) 
We went in several places, and 
We had a 
drink or two ; 
To an oyster house we then did go, 
And had an oyster stew. 
To a 
house in Prince street then we went, 
And up the stairs we ran; 
He seemed to be acquainted there, 
Did this very polite young man. (Cno) 
At a 
table then we both sat down, 
'Twas covered o'er with green, 
Such a 
curious game as there was played 
Before I'd never seen. 
At his advice I 
bought some checks, 
To play I 
soon began, 
When soon I 
lost cash, watch and all, 
Through this very polite young man. (Cno) 
When from the table I 
arose 
I 
didn't have a

And my polite young friend had left, 
And none knew where he went.

tore my hair, 
And down the stairs I 
ran, 
And I've been looking ever since 
For this very polite young man. (Clio)

I'm going to sing of a 
flashy young gent, 
Who once lived in this city, but now he has left it, 
To go to a

This nobby young gent always wore a 
gold watch,

And a 
nice diamond ring and a 
pin, I 
declare, 
Though his wages were small, for by trade he was only 
A 
journeyman barber with. nice curly hair. 
This journeyman barber played Keno and Faro, 
And visited all the flash places in town ; 
Of cash he had plenty, and freely he'd spend it, 
He was voted by ali the best fellow around.

On the corners he'd stand when the day it was fine, 
sirs, 
As the girls would pass by then at them he would 
stare, 
For he was a " killer " among the young ladies, 
Was this journeyman barber with nice curly hair. 
This journeyman barber he owned a 
light wagon, 
And a 
mare that could go at a 
two-forty pace; 
At the race- course you'd always be sure for to find him, 
Whenever there happened to be any race. 
lIe'd then bet his money on this horse and that one, 
But he'd lay all he had on his favorite mare ; 
Oh! he was a 
sport that but few could get over, 
This journeyman barber with nice curly hair. 
This journeyman barber at last he got tired 
Of cutting men's hair and of shaving their chins ; 
He concluded to leave, as the trade didn't suit him, 
And six dollars a 
week wouldn't keep him in pins. 
So he then left his place, but he still was a 
sport, sirs, 
For of money he yet always had a 
good share, 
And his nice horse and wagon he yet would ride 
out in, 
Would this journeyman barber with nice curly 
hair. 
This journeyman barber to all was a 
puzzler, 
For no one could tell how his money he made, 
Till at last he was nabbed " dead to rights" " shoving 
queer," sirs, 
When all his bright hopes for the future did fade. 
He begged for release, but the judge couldn't see it, 
So to Sing Sing he went for a 
little fresh air; 
And now he is there breaking stones in the quarry, 
This journeyman barber with nice curly hair.

Can only be found in thee.

And her sweet, laughing eyes, just as blue as the skies, 
Are the things to drive dull care away. 
She can dance like a

Her voice is the sweetest I 
ever have heard, 
She's the " pink of perfection "—don't think me ab-

At the balls and the parties with dear little Nell, 
For I'm sure that at all she'll be crowned as the belle, 
Will that dear little charmer of mine. (Clio.)

WRITTEN AND SUNG BY DICE WEAVER. 
Now, kind friends, all attention pay, 
And listen to my ditty: 
I'll tell what to me did befall, . 
When I 
came to New York City. 
The first night that I 
came to town, 
I 
went to the theater, 
And there I 
lost my heart upon 
A dandy hoop-skirt- maker. 
Cnouus—Yes-sir-ee, . 
She was a 
nobby girl, 
Oh! yes-sir-ee I 
I 
sat beside her all the time 
Until the play was ended, 
I 
asked her how she liked the piece, 
Said she, " I 
think its splendid," 
She kindly asked me then if I 
To her lodging-place would take her; 
Said I, " I'll take you anywhere, 
My dandy hoop-skirt maker." (Csouus.) 
So then she slipped her arm in mine, 
And off we trudged so gayly; 
Her troubles then she told to me, 
flow she was working daily. 
Said she, " My name is Sarah Jane, 
My other name is Laker; 
I 
belong to the crinoline brigade, 
I'm a 
dandy hoop- skirt-maker." (CHouus.) 
58 
DICK WEAVER'S 
Before her lodging-place was reached, 
She'd all of my affections ; 
I 
asked if I 
could call again, 
She said she'd no objections. 
Then she kissed her hand and said " Good-
night," 
As meek as any quaker, 
And up the stairs did go in haste, 
My dandy hoop-skirt-maker. 
(CHORUS.) 
I 
often called to see her then— 
At last I 
popped the question ; 
She simpered, smiled, and blushing, said, 
" 
Well, I've got no objection." 
Bich presents then I 
made to her, 
And everywhere I'd take her, 
For nothing was too good, you know, 
For my dandy hoop-skirt-maker. (Cuo.) 
I 
gave her money then to buy 
An outfit for the wedding, 
And a 
house I 
furnished nice and neat 
With furniture and bedding. 
The minister was then engaged, 
Who said my wife he'd make her, 
And the wedding-day was settled by 
My dandy hoop-skirt-maker.. (aromas.) 
But just before the day came 'round 
She falsely did deceive me ; 
She broke her vow and broke my heart 
The day that she did leave me. 
For all my furniture she sold, 
Then ran off with a 
baker; 
And that's the last I've ever seen 
Of my dandy hoop-skirt-maker. (CrtoRtra.)

Huckleberry Kate and Gooseberry Joe. 
PATHETIC BALLAD. 
WRITTEN AND SUNG WITH GREAT SUC-
CESS BY DICK WEAVER. 
Come listen to me every one, 
And a 
sad tale I'll relate, 
Of a 
pair of youthful lov-i-ers, 
Who lived in New York State. 
They lied somewhere near Squedunk town, 
In the neighborhood of Buttermilk Hill, 
Where huckleberries grow on chestnut trees, 
And Canary birds are fed on swill. 
CHORUS. 
So draw your handkerchiefs every one, 
For the tears like rain will flow, 
When you hear the sad fate of Huckleberry Kate, 
And her true love, Gooseberry Joe. 
Now Gooseberry Joe was a 
fine young man, 
His hair curled so nice and neat; 
He was six foot four, but the devil a 
foot more, 
And be Was rather stout—around the feet. 
He was chief dish-licker in a 
coffee and cake saloon, 
And his wages didn't amount to much; 
He fell deep in love with Huckleberry Kate, 
Whose parents were extremely Dutch. 
Now Huckleberry Kate and Gooseberry Joe 
Were walking out together one night, 
The little Katy-don'ts were singing in the trees, 
And the moon was shining out so clear and bright. 
He asked her if she'd marry him ; she said, " I 
guess 
I 
will, 
For I 
think that you love me pretty much ; 
So let us go to- night and get married slick and 
tight," 
Then she said a 
little something else in Dutch. 
DICK WEAVER'S 
To the parson's they were going, to get married right 
away, 
When an accident cud happen unto Joe, 
For a great big ugly p'ison snake jumped up from 
out the grass, 
And bit poor Joseph on his biggest toe. 
He howled and shrieked most mournfully, ' twas aw-
ful for to hear, 
Then gave a 
jump and fell upon his side; 
He tore his hair in agony, kicked up an axOul fuss, 
Then quietly gave up the ghost and died. 
Poor Kate stood there in mute surprise, she knew not 
what to do, 
When she saw him lying there so stiff and dead ; 
" 
Oh ! won't you speak to me ?" she cried, " to me, 
your Katie dear ?" 
But the divel a 
word to her poor Joseph said. 
Then she pulled a 
great big butcher-knife out of her 
waterfall, 
To cut her throat I 
thought she would begin ; 
But she quietly turned on her heel and walked to-
ward her home, 
And the very next day got blind drunk on gin.

BANJO SOLO. 
WRITTEN AND SUNG BY DICK WEAVER. 
Now, white folks, your attention give, 
And listen to my ditty : 
It's of a 
piece of Crinoline, 
Who sports it ill this city. 
She lives around in Hester street, 
Her name is Miss Van Blade, 
Her daddy keeps a 
sausage-shop, 
And sells them ready made. '

I 
met her in an omnibus— 
I 
really do declare ! 
Such e) es and lips I 
never saw, 
And oh I 
such coal- black hair. 
I 
could not keep my eyes from her, 
But at her I 
did stare ; 
When she got out I 
followed, and 
Forgct to pay my fare! 
I 
went- next day down to the shop, 
Ana by surprise I 
caught her t 
Scraping the bristles"otT a 
pig 
In a 
big tub of water. 
Those coal-black curls I 
did not see, 
But in their place, I 
swear, 
Was nothing but a 
scanty crop 
Of dirty reddish hair. 
I 
stood and looked at her awhile, 
At her confusion smiled ; 
IIer face at once got very red, 
I 
knew that she was " riled"; 
She turned on me, and in a 
rage, 
Said," Du, vat vilst du here ? 
Git arouse tam quick— I'll 
slog you on de 
kopf," 
Then she hit Inc with a 
sausage on the ear. 
Advice I'll give to all young men 
Who like to cut a 
shine, 
Don't let your fancy run away 
With a 
piece of crinoline. 
The outward show may all seem fine, 
And pleasing to the sight, 
But on a 
nearer view you'll find 
Things do not look so bright.

As by-words now are all the go, 
I 
think I'll try and sing, sirs, 
About a 
new one that's come out, 
You'll say it's just the thing, sirs. 
As we all journey on through lire, 
Each one will seek for pelf, sirs, 
But of course I 
needn't tell 
on diat, 
For you know how it is yourself, sirs. 
A rusty old cove of three-score ten 
Runs after a 
maiden fair, sirs, 
He praises all her charms, and falls 
In love with her golden hair, sirs. 
He takes her to private supper-rooms, 
hugs and kisses this little elf, sirs, 
And what comes in then after that, 
Why, you know how it is yourself, sirs. 
A politician visits you, 
And asks you for your vote, sirs, 
And slyly slips into your hand 
A twenty-dollar note, sirs. 
Of course you take his money, for 
You don't go back on pelf, sirs, 
And his rival gives you twenty more, 
And you vote to suit yourself, sirs,. 
There's Grant, that President of ours, 
A man who don't know much, sirs, 
We're sick and tired of him, I 
vow, 
And don't want any such, sirs. 
He spends his time in traveling 'round 
And spending the nation's wealth, sirs, 
GREAT KENO SONGSTER. 
But of course I 
needn't tell you that, 
For you know how it is yourself, sirs. 
He's trying to purchase, you know, 
A place called San Domingo; 
A worthless, useless place it is, 
A regular fraud, by jingo ! 
Ly annexing it to the United States, 
, 
He'll make a 
pile of pelf, sirs, 
But of course I 
needn't tell you that, 
I For you know how it is yourself, sirs. 
But now I 
think I'll say adieu, 
It's time for me to go, sirs; 
There's a 
damsel waiting for me, too, 
I 
must not delay, you know, sirs. 
For there's somezhing good in store for me, 
When I 
see this little elf, sirs, 
But of course I 
needn't tell you that, 
For you know how it is yourself, sirs.

In the wonderful days of mysteries, 
How many strange things we see 
How many strange sayings we hear on the streets, 
Wherever we happen to be I 
Sensations, you know, are all the go, 
But they often turn out a 
bilk, 
But the greatest sensation that's out of late 
Is the one about " -gin and milk." 
CHORUS. 
They say it's a 
very fine drink indeed, 
It makes you so jolly and blithe,

'Twas invented, you know, by the great gin and 
milkest, 
The Rev. Mr. Smythe. 
They say it's becoming a 
popular drink, 
And all the boys now scoop it in 
They never more ask for brandy and wine, 
They're all going cranky on gin 
L 
The congressmen, statesmen, and ministels too, 
And .a great many more of that ilk, 
Are all going hack on the old-fas.hioned drinks, 
And the order is," Gin and milk." (Craprius.) 
Now the Reverend Mr. See Bee Stnythe' 
Is a 
very nice man, I 
vow, 
To preach a 
good sermon on gin and milk, 
"Kira just bet your eatt he knOws how. 
The ladies admire his nice, winning ways, 
And his whiskers, as soft as silk, 
But they say it's not right for him to get tight 
On his favorite " gin and milk." (Cnonus.) 
Now the Reverend Mr. See Bee Smythe 
Will give'fip`bis pre-aching Soon,' 
lie tells me that preaching is getting played out, 
So he's going to start a 
saloon; 
And he hopes that you'll visit him once in'a 
And.he'll show you that he's no bilk, 
But he'll sell neither brandy or bourbon or wine, 
He'll only sell " gin and milk." (Cuonus.)
