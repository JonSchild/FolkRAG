April 26, 2014, Mark Wagler interviewing Nancy Lanyon in Madison, Wisconsin. 
Nancy born in Dodgeville, Wisconsin in 1945. Her ethnicity is Cornish and Irish. And her triple-
great-grandfather was Solomon Juneau, who married a French-Menominee woman, so she 
has a very small amount of native blood. Has a B.S. in Education, K-8 level and a Masters in 
Educational Technology. 1989-1991 taught at Lincoln Elementary, and at Hawthorne 
Elementary from 1991 to present time. Before teaching, she had two careers. With her ex-
husband, she had a touring children’s theater group for about 15 years; they traveled to 
elementary schools in Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin and Minnesota. After they divorced, she 
worked under the Wisconsin Arts Board as an artist-in-residence, where she would go to 
elementary schools and help them create dramas and children’s theater. But since she was 
divorced with two children, she needed to stay in one place. She went to University of 
Wisconsin Continuing Studies for counseling, and they suggested she become a teacher. She 
said, “Oh my god, I’ve been in schools for twenty years, do you know what I think of public 
education?” The counselor told her to put her money where her mouth was. So, she thought 
she’d teach for 5-7 years, until her kids were grown, and then she’d go back to creative drama. 
She went to the university where they made a lot of accommodations for her to get her 
degree quickly. She did 53 credits in 13 months, got good grades, was sure she’d be a great 
teacher. She went off with very little student teacher experience, and fell flat on her face 
when she went to Lincoln. She didn’t know anything practical. She had a lot of theoretical, but 
no practical. She couldn’t run a mimeograph, didn’t know how to store things in a classroom—
it was a funny year. 
00:05:15  
A typical day: the perfect days she remembers are totally connected with the 
Heron Network. Such a day would include leaving the school building—she doesn’t like school 
buildings.  All of her principals were okay with her taking her students out of the building for 
half a day. When she started teaching at Hawthorne, they were near an empty marsh, which 
they would go to and explore. Some kids started out afraid of being outside. One girl who was 
afraid in September, by November allowed a spider that was on her crawl down her arm to 
the ground. After a half day in the marsh, they would walk back to the school. Nancy would 
give them a Jolly Ranger as a reward to suck as they walked back to school, then they’d spend 
the rest of the day examining what they had learned. That fieldtrip would be the basis for 
classroom exploration for multiple days afterward, reading and measuring and researching. It 
would offer real-world context to pull the academics. Toward the end of the week, there 
would be more academics and Nancy would try to find information about things she thought 
they would next observe in the marsh as seasons changed. Every week, they would leave the 
building for half a day to observe in the marsh. Nancy said that she would teach as long as she 
could outwalk ten-year-olds.

What makes a rough day? Nancy is having rougher days now, because the time 
has changed and the ability to leave the building has been curtailed: teachers have to change 
classrooms with other people; specials get scheduled in the middle of the morning; the town 
put a parking lot, a walkway, a soccer field, a picnic area where the marsh used to be. It 
became much less safe and less wild.  In school it became harder to find a block of time when 
somebody didn’t want some of her children. Nancy used to be able to argue against that, but 
now requirements by law make it harder for them to say yes to Nancy. About 3-4 years ago, it 
got harder, so they’d go every two weeks or every month. But you can’t watch context change 
with sporadic visits. They began giving her more and more technology, more computers, 
which she loved. She thought it balanced with the outside world—but now it is all flat-screen. 
There is no balance. She wants her workbench, pots and plants back, because these children 
need to touch things. But she hasn’t the space, because technology has invaded; she hasn’t 
the time, and now she has children who are no longer developmentally at the right kinesthetic 
level. She has ten year olds who want to break things because they are really just four or five 
in their kinesthetic development. They want to break expensive science stuff, and she has to 
talk to them every 90 seconds to avoid that, whereas in the marsh she could let them observe 
for an hour without that intervention. She spends a lot more time saying “No” rather than 
“Wow.”  She and the children find it rough, more stressful. 
00:12:40 
Her teaching has been influenced by the Heron Network. The Heron Network is 
a group that does “narrative inquiry”—it has kids do something and then tell the story. Nancy 
liked that because she is a storyteller. A group of teachers, which varied in size, investigated 
science, then math, then history, then personal culture. The Heron Network was looking at 
culture long before it became popular to do so. The Heron Network let children investigate 
whatever interested them.  One of Nancy’s favorite research questions was, How would 
chocolate chip cookies work without certain ingredients?  That child set up the experiment, 
but her mother wouldn’t go buy her the things that she needed, so the narrative started out 
scientific but ended up as social science because she had to make the cookies with just what 
she had and they didn’t turn out. Someone might look at that and say, that’s not science. But 
Nancy still remembers it twenty years later, and what it reveals about a culture that cannot 
facilitate something as simple as the purchase of baking soda so that the cookies don’t get 
made right—that is very important, crucial, sad, informative—it doesn’t have to be just one 
thing.  
00:15:45  
It was watching the children ask questions. So, they might be at the marsh and 
want to race. But they knew they had to ask a research question to justify racing: “What is the 
average time it takes a 4th and 5th grader in Nancy Lanyon’s class to run fifty meters?” So, 
then they had to measure fifty meters, and they used a watch to time the runs, then they 
wrote the times down, then averaged the times. This was all directed by the kids, not Nancy.  
For three days afterward, Nancy taught averages—which she hadn’t planned to do, but the 
kids wanted to learn it. When the Heron Network would meet, the teachers would share 
stories and then try out each other’s ideas, to do child-centered education. Child-centered 
education doesn’t mean pandering to whatever the child wants to do. It was children doing, 
Wisconsin Classroom Teachers

and teachers as serious academics very skilled in their jobs, seeing the point that could be 
elucidated by the investigation of the child. And that is how Nancy has tried to teach ever 
since, even now when she is confined in her “box,” she tries not to follow the rules. 
00:19:25  
What are some signature interactions with students? Nancy tells a story: her 
third year teaching, she had an African-American boy who interrupted about fifteen times a 
minute. He couldn’t be quiet. She had a nice class that year; they had a system where if a 
student was naughty they’d get an X and a certain number of Xs meant they would lose recess 
time. The class knew this boy was special, so they agreed he could have five times the 
numbers of Xs as the rest of them before he lost recess time. On their Harvest Festival day, 
Nancy sent him home because she held to a bottom line for behavior. She made his mother 
come get him; she held him accountable for two years. About a year and a half ago, Nancy was 
in the dog park, and a 6’4” African American man comes running across the park, throws his 
arms around her in a hug, and says, “Nancy Lanyon! Nancy Lanyon!” She recognized his smile 
and said his name. He told Nancy that his life now is good; he is training to be a carpenter. 
When he was a child, his life at home was bad, “But I would come to school, and you would 
love me. You never let me get away with anything. And I think you think I didn’t like you. But I 
knew you loved me. And all my life I knew you loved me. No matter what I did you just kept 
loving me.” Nancy was stunned and flattered.  
All her life she has been the “take the naughty kids” person—everyone gave her the “naughty” 
kids. Sometimes she worried that she only gave them person-specific affection, but this man 
made her think it went farther. About four months later, another 6’4” man—a Caucasian 
one—comes into her classroom, hugs her. This is a child that was physically violent, 
emotionally in turmoil, and Nancy held a bottom line with him and kept loving him. If students 
misbehaved, they had to stand at the wall. At the class picnic that year, he misbehaved and 
had to stay at the wall—Nancy brought him a hotdog, but he couldn’t play any games. That 
summer, he knocked on her door and said “I don’t mean to bother you, but I wanted to tell 
you that next year, I am going to be at that picnic!” His problem was that he wouldn’t stop 
misbehaving, so the recess time being taken away from him would be doubled or more. But 
the next year, he came running across the playground to Nancy, waving his homework and 
saying, “I got it! I got it! I have learned that one is much better than five!” He told Nancy that 
he knew she loved him, for the two years he was in her classroom.  His father had died, his 
mother was an alcoholic, and he had to be the adult at home. That’s what Nancy did for 
“naughty” kids—she had a line that couldn’t be crossed. Kids could swear at her, throw things 
at her, but they can’t forget their homework. She wants to teach them how to be responsible. 
00:26:10  
How did her students learn real-world culture? Hawthorne school is fortunate; 
it is a third Caucasian, a third African American, and a third other cultures of the world, 
primarily Hmong and Hispanic, but also African, Chinese, South American and other Asian 
countries. Exploration of world cultures fits both 4th and 5th grade curriculum. It fits “who 
came to Wisconsin” as well as what cultures are in the U.S. Most years, her students would 
investigate some aspect of their personal culture. It could be music, food, dress, story, 
language. One year a student did a project on the idioms in his language. One student brought 
Wisconsin Classroom Teachers 
 afc2013/017

in Jamaican food one year. Some years it was less flamboyant, but they would always attempt 
to show elements of other cultures so kids would be exposed to it. Nancy didn’t have to find it, 
it was all right there at the school. 
 
00:30:05  
Working with colleagues: for a while at the school, five of the teachers had 
been either student teachers or practicum teachers of Nancy’s. Currently just two were 
student teachers of Nancy’s—her best friend and a teacher she partners with. Her school was 
as close to home environment as she could want. A lot of the teachers at her school are artists 
and musicians. At her school, people might fight but they make up, and everyone supports 
each other. For a while, there were a lot of gay teachers at the school because it was a safe 
place to be. It is one of the most supportive buildings in the district. Everyone says hello to the 
substitute teachers; that doesn’t happen in other schools. They do out-of-school activities 
together, such as bowling. In school, it’s like parenting—you don’t tell people how to parent or 
how to teach. So it is more formal in school, it’s a little hard to form those relationships in the 
building, but they have all tried very hard to create events. They are near the restaurant 
Pedro’s, so there were two teachers who worked hard to get everyone to go to Pedro’s every 
Thursday for Happy Hour. Would have Magical Mystery Tours—someone would get a school 
bus, and they would get on it and not know where they were going. They had a Game Night. In 
the last eight years, the principal has gotten them funds to go places. They have been to 
Atlanta, to the Black Child Development Conference. They went to Harlem for an investigative 
thing.  
 
00:36:00  
They went to California, where they met Sharroky Hollie, and got him to come 
to Madison for a year “to tell us what to do.” When everyone in the whole school is going to 
be criticized by someone, each person comes out of their session and everyone asks “what 
about you?” It isn’t the good things that bind you—it’s the stressful things, like being stuck in 
an airport together or being critiqued—that binds you together. Staff meetings don’t support 
the kind of community that Nancy has been speaking of. Not because they don’t try; their 
principal is very supportive of experimental events. A couple of years ago they told the 
principal they couldn’t take the staff meeting anymore because it was a waste of time. 
Couldn’t they teach themselves? So for a year or two, they took that staff meeting time, broke 
it into three 30 minute blocks, and people would sign up to teach something they knew, and 
each person would sign up to attend two of them. And the principal had 15 minutes to 
“deliver the nonsense”, and then they’d go off to teach culturally-relevant material, or a 
literacy topic, or a lesson done well. After two years, the district stepped in and made them do 
other things. 
 
00:39:35  
[cell phone ringing; phone shut off] Other colleagues who aren’t the staff at 
Hawthorne school? The Heron Network, because they used to meet very regularly; those were 
colleagues from about five other schools. In the beginning, they all talked a lot of philosophy, 
and discussed how they could break the rules. Once the students started doing inquiry, they 
discussed what to do with it. Then they started a journal and had to raise money to print it, so 
they had a talent show. The kids would come together at the university to share their 
questions in a conference. The Heron Network would meet weekend after weekend to put the 
Wisconsin Classroom Teachers 
 afc2013/017

journal together and learned a lot about computers. Situations like that create strong 
relationships, when you are working until 4 in the morning and you are not happy.  When you 
get angry with someone and still keep working with them, that becomes a friendship and 
develops relationships you can trust. Those friendships include not just teachers but people 
from the university. Nancy still has a video recorder from a grant that Michael Streibel wrote 
at the university. 
00:45:12  
The stories that Heron Network teachers told about their students were similar 
to those told by the teachers that Nancy worked with at Hawthorne, because children behave 
the same way. Heron Network stories differed in looking for the real world; most teachers at 
Hawthorne didn’t go out of the building the way Nancy did, except her friend and former 
student teacher Mary.  Because Nancy is a storyteller, the stories she tells to people outside 
the school are very similar to the ones she tells to people in the school—if it is a great story, 
she shares it. Because she is a storyteller, she has to tell the whole story to everyone; it’s why 
her family says she talks so much. 
00:50:10  
How has teaching changed from 1989 when she began until now, when she is 
retiring? It’s way less fun. The culture has changed. The technological revolution has created 
something that education is desperately trying to accommodate. Scores are going down; 
colleges are saying you are sending us students who can’t read or form sentences; they have 
come up with common core standards. Now it is like cattle in chutes. “Do it this way so you 
can have an outcome, because the student is a business.” Nancy knows it isn’t meant badly, 
that they want to do what is best for the student, but she doesn’t think they have found it. 
You have to go back to the “want” and change the “want” so that the child can self-direct 
themselves into a learning experience. Flat screen is not it; they might go to the computer and 
learn something, but it isn’t very real-world translatable. Just like when you watch TV for more 
than half an hour, you become crabbier and more indolent and less able to walk around the 
block. Students want to work with real, physical things. Real world stuff is fun. When Nancy 
had them making tri-cornered hats, they were loud and after an hour and a half, they didn’t 
want to stop. School right now is not very fun. 
00:55:15  
What does good teaching look like? Most students in the room are eyes-on the 
event, whether a person, a video—heads move, they listen to each other because they want 
the next thing coming. They stay focused. Not all kids—for some kids, attention and focus are 
a struggle. These days, about 80% of the class can stay focused. More and more kids need 
one-on-one instruction; some can’t even stay focused in a small group situation; a large group 
is a complete impossibility. This is something we are not attending to, but they can learn 
perfectly well one-on-one. You have to learn how to be a teacher. You have to learn when to 
talk and when to shut up. For 15-16 years, Nancy has attempted to teach herself to shut up, 
and only speak when she has to be at a door or a path of choice or when paraphrasing would 
be a good idea. A child doesn’t always need to be paraphrased. You have to be intentional 
about what you say. Teaching isn’t about standing in front of people and yammering on like a 
college professor—and they shouldn’t do it either. Teaching is: “we are going to learn about 
Gettysburg, and here is all the junk. Here is corn to grind and rope to braid.”  She describes the 
Wisconsin Classroom Teachers 
 afc2013/017

in-school museum that they are putting together exploring Gettysburg. People who don’t 
know much about teaching, like student teachers, want to come in and talk too much. Nancy 
wanted to do that at first. Now she only tells stories when she has a point to make. 
01:00:50  
How did Nancy learn how to manage a classroom?  She learned that skill when 
she was working for the Arts Board as an artist in residence and had to manage month-long 
residencies. She took the skill with her to teaching. As an artist, they might send a hard-to-
manage child to her, and she would love that child. Because she was 43 when she started 
teaching, she could manage multiple groups. For her it is as easy as rolling off a log. She can 
have six groups working, and that kind of noise doesn’t bother her. You have to distinguish 
between chaos and confusion.  You don’t just pick up on differentiation—that you have to 
learn and that’s what you have to study about children. One thing that she has had to work at 
for years to improve her teaching is geometry. She doesn’t get it. Her visual intelligence is low. 
Her only visual skill is reading a map. She doesn’t get tessellation. Also, there is an exercise 
where you show the students a picture of a cube for a few seconds then take it away so they 
can build one—she has taught that fifteen years and still doesn’t get it. Maisie Jenkins, who 
was her children’s teacher and Nancy’s cooperating teacher, was a gift to the teaching 
profession. She became a math teacher, and Nancy took three classes with her, and still could 
never remember how to make a cube. She has to have her student teacher teach geometry, 
because she can’t. She has learned that in any classroom, there will be amazing visual 
learners, and so she finds that child, and with a little bit of skill from Nancy, they teach the rest 
of the class geometry. 
01:05:42  
Nancy wishes there were more people in the profession of teaching; it’s 
essential. If there could be paraprofessionals hired by the millions. We are in a period where 
many professions are being eliminated. A computer can do in a weekend what it used to take 
200 lawyers to do. There are levels of professionals that are unemployed. We can’t keep 
having kids in groups of 25; we have kids who have had five or more different primary 
caretakers. We need to flood kids with adults who can help them learn. We call them 
educational aides, but Nancy thinks they should be called paraprofessionals, they should be 
paid and get insurance; they should be trained to teach, overseen by the teacher and there 
should be 3-5 in each room. Children need to have adults around, that’s what families have 
historically been about. You can’t have 25 kids with one person. Children need someone who 
knows them, who can tell when they can be taught and when they need to play. If our culture 
honored education, we could employ people who need jobs and put them in the classrooms 
to assist, and we would close the learning gap in ten years. 
01:09:015   
Nancy would tell a person who wants to become a teacher that teaching is 
changing. As a new teacher, you should do what they want you to do for about five years. You 
have to learn what they want before you can walk around it. Don’t worry about it, just hold 
onto your ideals, suffer through it, be a little ticked off, and do what they want. Find out if you 
like it. Can you do that job? And then you can find out which prong of the rules you can bend 
so that your soul can grow.” You have to love this. It is a ministerial professional. You care-
take, and you have to go past what you think you can do—you have to stay longer during the 
Wisconsin Classroom Teachers 
 afc2013/017 
6
day; it’s not an 8-to-5 job. “It’s an achingly difficult profession.” But as a new teacher, you 
have to do what they say for the first five years, because if you bend the wrong prong, you can 
get into a lot of trouble. They really watch you the first five years. They observe you the first 
three years, it’s tough, you don’t know all the rules. A friend says, ‘The first year, they lose 
money on you. The second year they kind of break even, as a school district. The third year, 
they maybe start to make money.” So, at first, don’t judge yourself harshly. Cry if you want to, 
get back on the horse. Then, try to make a profession that suits your soul and the rules. If you 
can’t do it, better find a different profession. 
01:12:35  
Nancy followed Mark Wagler through the University of Wisconsin education 
program, and they all asked her as a storyteller, “Oh, do you know Mark Wagler?” Mark made 
it so easy for Nancy; it was a joy ride through school. She really intended only to teach about 
five years, raise her kids and get back out into the artistic profession. She didn’t think she’d 
like it because as an artist, she didn’t think much of teaching. Somewhere around year five, 
when she went to Hawthorne and found a place she could thrive, she decided to stay in 
teaching. There were a lot of artists at Hawthorne. Nancy still doesn’t think much of public 
education. She thinks it’s a mediocre place to be, but she gets it now. In our culture, it brings 
the up down a little, and it brings the down up a little, so we are all a little medium. Nancy had 
the gift of three principals who appreciated what she could do. Before the end of the year, she 
would give a lot of kids low grades so they could go to summer school, because non-English 
students need year-round schooling. Her principal closed her eyes to that. So Nancy stayed for 
twenty-five years, and she loved it—until suddenly she didn’t love it. She decided to retire 
because she was done. And a month after she decided, she found out a lot of nonsense was 
going to be coming down the pike; she doesn’t like any of it. But she didn’t retire because she 
didn’t like it; there is no negative in her retirement at all; she was just done. It’s a positive 
closure.
