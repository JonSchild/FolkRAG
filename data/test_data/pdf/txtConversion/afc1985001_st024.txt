The Dying Girl's Message
THE DYING GIRL'S MESSAGE
Lois Judd Arvin, 1940
Raise the window Mother Darling For no air can harm me now Let the breeze blow in upon
me It will cool my fever brow For Death will soon relieve my sorrow And will still this aching
heart But I have a dying message I must speak before we part.
There is one you know dear Mother Though I can not call his name How with loving words
he won me How my tender love he gained How he won my own affection Now he's casting
me aside How he's wooed and won another For a girl to be his bride.
Take this ring from on my finger Where he's placed it long ago Tell him indeath I bestowed
Tell him it is a token, Mother Of the sorrows caused me pain - Tell him I am dying easy
And I hope we'll meet again Hark I near a band of music 'Tis my saviour's voice I hear And
the angels they are waiting On the other side. Mother meet your child in heaven One more
kiss and then goodbye.
