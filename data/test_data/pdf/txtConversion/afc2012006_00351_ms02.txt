Log – G. MARTINEZ -  09-26-2012 
 
[00:02] Recorded 09-26-2012 at the home of Gilbert Martinez, Houston, Texas. 
[00:06] Gilbert Martinez [GM] born 08-27-1975 Aransas Pass, TX. Lived in Rockport 
until high school graduation. Father, Gilbert Sr. was a shrimper; stepfather, Mike 
Campbell, owned a fisherman’s supply in Aransas Pass. His extended family was all 
shrimpers.  
[03:59] Father was against him being a fisherman, but [GM,SR.] moved to Virginia 
when [GM] was a boy. They remained close. 
[06:10] After graduation [GM] visited uncle, Hector Saucedo, a tugboat captain in 
Hawaii who helped him enroll in the Maritime Training School, Tongue Point in 
Astoria, Oregon. He graduated in ’95 with a deck rating as an Able Bodied Seaman. 
[11:21] It was first time away from home. His 1st  job was with Hornbeck Offshore 
out of Port Aransas on the Canonaro, a supply boat for offshore oil rigs. The Captain, 
Dana Dyer, took him under his wing. 
[17:36] Next job was on an Oil Response Boat in Galveston to deal with oil spills. 
Joined the Seafarer’s International Union and hired on with Moran Towing for 30 
days on a tanker, Shelia Moran, going to Florida. Tool a full time job on the Doris 
Moran, a gas barge and tug working the Gulf and up the east coast. Chief Engineer, 
Wallace “Scooter”Ashwood, worked w/[GM] to get his Mate’s License and became 
the 2nd Mate on the ‘Doris.’ [29:43] Took an interest in tug assist boats used in ports 
to help vessels dock. Got relief work with G&H Towing in Corpus. Left Moran for full 
time job w/G&H as a wheelman on tug in the Houston Ship Channel where he 
moved with future wife, Allison. [41:23] Moved thru the 6 classes of tugs to Z drives, 
the most advanced. Became Captain after 4 yrs. In May ’07 while working a Z drive 
tug, the Shannon, was voted in to Houston Pilots. Because he worked tugs, [GM] had 
not sailed a ship.   
[48:41] Captain Luna, Houston Pilot, encouraged him to apply and helped move the 
process along at the Pilot’s Association. For [GM’S] 3 yr. apprenticeship as a deputy 
pilot was assigned to Captain Barkley his Master to oversee training. Got 1st Class 
Captain’s License for the Port of Houston after 30 transits (round trips) of the Ship 
Channel and a 90 testing period. This rigorous test required 6 month’s of his living 
at home and his son and wife living in Rockport to make the studying possible. 
[59:33] To learn piloting the ships [GM] rode with Pilots 18 months before piloting 
on his own. At 1st 1000 ft. tankers were intimidating. For the final 18 months he 
piloted without observation on limited tonnage vessels. On his time off  he piloted 
larger ships under observation, including car ships, container ships, crew tankers 
and oversize tankers. His trip with Captain Pizzatola on an Exxon 5 docking taught 
him the value learning from one’s mistakes. This shaped [GM’s] approach to training 
Deputy Pilot’s today. 
[1:16:14] Among the people who were inspirations to [GM] are: Hector Saucedo 
who helped him when starting his career, Wallace “Scooter” Ashwood, who helped 
him get licensed as an officer, Charlie Tuck and Bill Palmer who supported him on 
becoming a Houston Pilot, and finally his wife Allison who has supported him 
throughout his career of working a demanding schedule.
