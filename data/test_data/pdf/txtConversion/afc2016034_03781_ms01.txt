Commissioner; discussion of difficulties for people with sex offenses; she wants people to 
ask about people's crimes—how long ago, what type; 
Lack of affordable housing; housing was expensive during the oil boom, now the market is 
softer; people with any mark on their record or who don't have all the money for security 
deposit and rent will not be selected as a tenant; "Grandma's House" was a place with units 
to rent to these folks and she would work with people there, but new ownership has 
changed that a bit;

front area has the rule of Benedict "Let all be received as Christ", but being Christian is not

coffee 
• Separate sacred space where people pray or just be quiet; 
• Food pantry is very large; Anyone can shop; Mathew 25: "I was hungry, you fed 
me"; each shopper is accompanied by a volunteer to promote relationship; people

• Children's play area; every child gets a new toy; 
• Conference room; primarily used by people working with youth who can enter 
through the back of the building for privacy; 
Challenges; the unfairness of things; how to support someone and then send them back into 
the cold; people who may never get the support they need; uses the Serenity Prayer and 
focus on people for the two hours she can; the "second prison" of being an ex-offender; 
How she effects systems change; she was a senate intern in Washington, D.C., comes from a 
social change family; father was in the North Dakota legislature; she wants to change the 
world in a local way and with others and with spirituality; parents still active; father 
advocates for affordable housing for people in mobile homes; 
A success is that people leave knowing that they're important people and know they are 
loved; when someone leaves homelessness for a home; story about a gentleman getting a 
job; story about a man in the penitentiary; success is that we don't lock people up in any 
kind of institution and forget them;

Other meals for people in the area are scant; a former soup cafe closed and will re-open 
nearby; 
Advice for people who want to serve in this way: listen to people; listen to the passions of 
volunteers to leverage their talent; she works with two phrases: "Thank you" for the 
abundance, and "I didn't know" to express an invitation to learn; 
Sr. Kathleen feels this is sacred work; the trust and fragility of people;
