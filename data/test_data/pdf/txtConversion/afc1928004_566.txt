THE WHITEWASH MAN. 
Written, Composed and Sung by DAN COLLYER, at Tony Pastor's 
Theatre. A very popular song. 
Copyrighted, 1881, by A. J. FISHER. 
I'm a 
retired old whitewasher, 
And I've saved a 
little cash; 
When I 
was a 
little younger, 
I 
used to cut a 
dash; 
But now I 
am much wiser, 
I 
don't possess a 
care; 
So come and spend an evening, boys, 
At my house around the square. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, although I 
look rather old, I feel very 
yout. 
Aly milk of human kindness has not turned into 
cheese yet. 
Oh, dear, no! I 
am very fond of society, too; 
I 
invite you all around to my house in the square s but— 
Chorus—Mind you come, diddle dum, 
Oh to my, diddle dum, 
Little house, diddle dum, 
If it's fair, diddle dum, 
You shall have, diddle dum, 
Oh, such nice, diddle dum, 
At my house around the corner 
In the square. 
Once I 
was a 
gay young fellow, 
I 
was fond of seeing life; 
But now I'm old and mellow, 
I 
should like to take a 
wife; 
I'm not like young men of the day, 
Who often do engage; 
To snare and catch a 
pretty bird, 
Before they've bought the cage. 
SPoKEN.—Whenever I 
do my courting, I 
do it in the 
good, old-fashioned style; not like the young men now- a-
days— falling in love in ten minutes, and wanting to get 
married in a 
quarter of an hour. 
Ha! ha! ha! ha! 
sow, 
I've got a 
very nice little cage, and should there be any 
pretty little birds here to-night that would like to come and 
see it, they are quite welcome, but— (Chorus), 
Papa's Chest Protector's Faded. 
Written by DAN Commat, and sung with great success. 
Papa's chest protector's faded, 
Lost the color on his chest; 
Faded now for once and ever, 
From the sweat caused by his vest; 
Oh, the many years he's worn it, 
Never has it seen a 
change; 
How our bull-pup slept upon it, 
And from it he's caught the mange. 
CHORUS: 
Papa, papa, darling papa, 
Don't spread your mug at me with wrath; 
For its true that you've grown lighter, 
Since you took that Turkish bath. 
Think of when you had the jim-jams, 
How I 
never left your bed; 
How I 
hired Tom Jones, the Cooper, 
To put a 
hoop around your head; 
Oh, my gall, how you do flutter, 
For, of chest protectors, when I 
think 
How you've oft protected papa, 
When he's braced men for a 
drink. 
Pap, you darling, old brace, papa, 
At hoisting schooners you're the boss; 
But your nose is growing brighter, 
Since you've been budging at O'Rourkes,

I've a 
neat little cabin that's built out of mud, 
Not far from the County Kildare; 
I've an acre or two where I 
grow my own spuds, 
I've enough and a 
little to spare; 
Sure I've not come over here seeking your jobs, 
But a 
short little visit to pay; 
So be aisy and free while you're drinking with me, 
I'm a 
man you don't meet every day. 
I've a 
neat little colleen that dwells in my cot, 
Oh, happy, contented is she; 
I've a 
thumping big lad that will say to his dad, 
There's a 
man you don't meet every day; 
And when for my leisure I'm out for a 
walk, 
The boys they all stop and they stare; 
And they say to each other as I'm passing by, 
There's a 
man you don't meet every day.

WHEN THE FLOWERS ARE ASLEEP. 
Written by CHARLES R. DocKsTADTEn, and sung by DAN CCLLYER, 
with Tony Pastor's Immense Company: 
Where the watermelons grow, 
The wind in the key of G 
doth blow; 
Where the rippling waters ramble, 
O'er the mossy jack-stones; 
Meet me with thy glossy smile, 
Blushes fan thy granite brow; 
Sylph-like glide thy cow-hide footsteps, 
Oh, ho, ho, hallo me Hannah. 
Cnottus: 
When the flowers walk in their sleep, 
And the night-mare trots the deep, 
Oome back home in your bare feet. 
Beloved, fair one, me Annie. 
When thy young heart's pure and free, 
Beats, dead beats, alone for me; 
Musha Mickey, .Mikey, oh, ho, ho, ho, 
Thin be jabers, Annie; 
Ach du bit verrtickt mein kind, 
Pigeon-toed are thy footsteps; 
Hear the hydrant how it fizzles, 
Down by the Tan Yard, me Annie. 
CHORUS: 
When the flowers are sound asleep, 
And the willows sob and weep, 
Rush back home and let us eat, 
Oh, ho, ho, be gosh, me Annie.

ABSENT-MINDED. 
Written by DAN COLLYER, and sung by him with great success at 
Tony Pastor's Opera House. 
Dedicated to SAM DEVERE. 
" 
Ever thine own Sam." 
Fm very absentminded, of course it's want of thought, 
But somehow I 
can always do things wrong; 
I 
make such sad mistakes, that my heart it nearly breaks, 
And don't think that I 
shall live so very long; 
A 
girl the other day fell o'er a 
heap of clay, 
And to render some assistance I 
did stop; 
But I 
left the girl for dead, and picked up some clay instead 
And with care I 
took it to a 
doctor's shop. 
Ukortts—Do pity me, my sorrows you can see, 
To do the thing that's right I 
feel inclined; 
But I'm very often fixed that I 
get tny suses mixed 
Because I've such a 
very absent mind. 
A 
lady in a 
train, placed a 
baby on my knees. 
It flurried me a 
hit beyond a 
doubt; 
The sn.oke from my cigar made the little baby sneeze, 
So through the window meant to throw it out; 
I 
was trying to be so kind, but still my absent mind, 
It very nearly drove me off my head; 
I 
thought 'twas my cigar, but a 
scream from baby's ma, 
Silo Ned me that I 
had slung the baby out instead. 
I'm quite as bad at home, once it was my \vife's desire, 
That I 
would take the kettle from the hob; 
Fill it full of water, and place it on the fire, 
But of course I 
made a 
muddle of the job 
When I 
brought the kettle hack, altho' with soot 'twas black 
I 
placed it on the chair where I 
reposed; 
Still my absence did aspire, I 
placed myself upon the fire 
And I 
toasted something else beside my clothes. 
I've a 
dog, a 
very large one, which many people dread, 
We'd both been out, ' twas raining very hard; 
I 
was so ab entminded, I 
placed the dog in bed, 
And myself I 
went and chained up in the yard; 
Things appeared all right, I 
lay there all the night, 
It rained, besides the night was very dark; 
I 
lay just like a 
dog, I 
thought I 
was a 
dog, 
&nd I 
never knew until I 
tried to bark,

The raccoon is a 
sassy thing, 
He walks all in the dark; 
He neither fears or he neither cares, 
'Till he hears the old dog's bark. 
CHORUS: 
Git along home yaller gals, 
For the evening stars are shining; 
Git along home yaller gals, 
For the evening stars are shining. 
I 
went down to see my gal, 
Miss Susan wasn't home; 
I 
sat myself in de old arm-chair, 
And played on de old jaw-bone. 
CHORUS: 
Git along home yaller gals, 
For the evening stars are shining; 
Git along home yaller gals, 
For the evening stars are shining.

ANGEL'S CALL. 
Written by J. K. JOHNSON. Sung and made popular by DAN COLLIER. 
As the sun is resting gently, 
At the close of this fair day; 
Angels fair from heavenly mansions, 
Gently, gladly float away; 
Through the halls of golden splendor, 
Through the maze of azure sky; 
Pause they o'er a 
cottage threshold, 
Where a 
bud has bloomed to die; 
Chorus.---Sweet heavenly music, 
Dear cherubic band; 
I 
will sing with you soon, 
In sweet glory land. 
Hark, and hear the faintest whisper, 
Friends, I'm really going there; 
4. 
There's a 
host of angel's truly, 
Floating round me everywhere; 
Cherubs robed in dazzling splendor, 
With immortal crowns of light; 
I 
shall view them all in glory, 
In that land that is so bright. 
Chorus.—They are taking me now, 
On their bosoms I 
lie; 
I'm going to glory, 
Dear friends, sweet, good-bye. 
As the sun is setting, gently, 
At the close of this fair day; 
As I 
wander o'er the foliage, 
Thinking of days past away; 
There are heavenly visions round me, 
Heavenly visions everywhere; 
For the mound in yonder church-yard, 
Represents an angel fair. 
Clwru8.—She's sleeping so sweetly, 
Oh, there let her rest; 
With roses and Hines, 
Upon her pure breast.

The Tramp. 
As recited by DAN COLLYER. 
Lemme sit down a 
minute, a 
stone's got in my shoe; 
Don't you commence your cussin', I 
ain't done nothin' to you. 
Yes, I'm a 
tramp. 
What of it ? 
Folks say we ain't no good 
But tramps has to live, I 
reckon, though folks don't think we 
should. 
Once I 
was strong and handsome, had plenty of cash and 
clothes, 
That was afore I 
tippled and gin got into my nose 
Down :n 
the Lehigh Valley me and my people g..:ew, 
I 
was a 
blacksmith, Cap'en—yes, and a 
good one, too; 
Me and my wife and Nellie. 
Nellie was just sixteen, 
She was the pootiest creeter the Valley had ever seen. 
Beaux? Why, she had a 
dozen—had 'em from near and fur, 
But they were mostly farmers—none of 'em suited her. 
There was a 
city stranger—young, handsome, and tall, 
Damn him—I 
wish I 
had him strangled agin that wall. 
He was the man for Nellie—she didn't know no ill; 
Mother, she tried to stop it, but you know a 
young gal's will. 
Well, it's the same old story—common enough, you'll say, 
He was a 
soft-tongued devil, and got her to run away. 
More than a 
month or cdter we heard from the poor young 
thing, 
He'd gone away and left her without a 
wedding ring. 
Back to her home we brought her, back to her mother's side, 
Filled with a 
raging fever—she fell at my feet and died. 
Frantic -with shame and trouble, her mother began to sink, 
Dead—in less than a 
fortnight—that's when I 
took to drink. 
Gimme one glass, Curnel, and then I'll be on my way, 
I'll tramp till I 
find that scoundrel, if it takes till the Judg-
ment Day.

THE TURNPIKE GATE. 
As sung by REYNOLDS k W ALLING. 
I 
am thinking-of ,the day when but a 
little child, 
I 
wandered o'er the meadows to the bill, 
Where the sweet flowers grew and forever growing wild 
And the stream e'er flowed by the mill. 
'But the old mill house has gone to decay, 
I 
loved it and so did darling.. 
Tat', 
And the miller he lies sleeping where the gentle breezes 
blow, 
And we played 'neath the Turnpike gate. 
CHORUS. 
For the Turnpike gate is the pride of my heart, 
I 
loved it and so did darling Kate, 
When she sits beside me now, there's a 
smile upon her 
brow, 
That reminds me of the Turnpike gate. 
And the old school-house has gone to decay, 
Where the schoolmaster heard us recite, 
And those happy, happy days have faded from our view, 
When our little hearts were filled with delight. 
And when the school was out we would wander to the 
spring, 
AV here I 
drew for you pictures on your alate„ 
And those happy childhood days they'll come again no 
more, 
When we played on the Turnpike gate. 
(Chorus.) 
12 
The Tables Turned. 
As told amid roars of laughter by DAN COLLYER. 
When I 
used to tend store in Baltimore, the old man came 
around one day, and says he: " Boys, the one that sells the 
most 'twixt now and Christmas, gets a 
vest pattern for a 
present." 
May Ile we didn't work for that vest pattern! I 
tell you there were some tall stories told in praise of goods 
just about that time; but the tallest talker and the one that 
had more cheek than any of us, was a 
certain Jonah Squires, 
who roomed with me. 
He could take a 
dollar out of a 
man's 
pocket when the man only intended to spend a 
sixpence; 
and the women—Lord bless you !—they just handed over 
their pocket books to him and let him lay out what he liked 
for them. 
One night Jonah woke me up with, " By Jove, old 
fellow, if you think that ' ere's got any cotton in it, I'll bring 
down the sheep that it was cut from, and make him swear to 
his wool 1 'Twon't wear out, neither; wore a 
pair of pants of 
that stuff for five years, and they are as good now as when I 
first put 'em on. 
Take it at thirty cents and I'll say you don't 
owe me anything. 
Eh! too dear? Well, call it twenty-eight 
cents. What d'ye say ? Shall I 
tear it ? All right, it's a 
bargain." 
I 
could feel Jonah's hand playing around the bed clothes for a 
minute, then rip ! tear! went something or other, and I 
hid 
my head under the blankets, perfectly convulsed with laughter, 
and sure that Jonah had torn the best sheet from top to bot-
tom. 
When I 
awoke next morning I 
found—alas! unkindest 
cut of all !—that the back of my night shirt was split from 
tail to collar-band. 
TOM BELL, in Dilk's bar room, fell out with Jack Hess, 
When Jack, who's a 
jovial elf, 
Anointed his brow with an axe that lay near, 
And promptly surrendered himself.

Sung by J. E. Munrar, of Mutants & MACK, for seventy-five consecutive

Our club is always noted for its larking and sparkins

Would set you wild with pleasure at the Twilight Coterie.

And still the fiddle and the horns are soundin' while 
boundin' 
Are all the merry spielers of the Twilight Coterie. 
CHORUS. 
Then it's on a 
summer's night in the park, my boys, 
Where the merry girls are singin' light and free, 
Hands around and round, and round, oh! what a 
lark, my 
boys, 
How the spielers prance, at the moonlight dance, of the 
Twilight Coterie. 
There's honored delegations from the " Starlights" and 
" 
Skylights," 
The " Ours" and " Yours" and other coteries, 
Together with their friends and their ladies, the daisies, 
Invited guest whose hearts are blessed with all the beet 
they please; 
It's skip and dip, and sachez round in glory, - 
Oh, Kate asthore! bang the floor, that's the style of girl 
for me, 
And so around we balance, and each daisy is crazy 
Wid great hilarity, all at the Twilight Coterie. 
(Chorus.)

and hides behind scene and peeps out, as enter through the door.) 
Low 
EEsE.—I wonder who that was throwing beans against 
the window ? 
That used to be the signal of my sweetheart 
when he wanted me to come out for a 
walk in the moonlight. He 
used to throw beans against the window and sing, come into the 
garden -.1tutd. 
But be has been away for a 
long time. 
The last 
time I 
heard of him, he was shipwrecked and cast away on the 
isle of Blackvell for six months, and I

don't see anybody around. 
Well, I 
will just warble a 
few notes and if it should be my 
sweetheart and he hears my voice he will come to me. (

A 
Contradiction. 
" 
The mill will never grind again 
With the water that has past." 
A 
maxim of the olden time 
That will forever last. 
This theme, in verses written, 
Preaches a 
sermon to all; 
But critically weighed with wisdom, 
How does the lesson fall ? 
The mill upon a 
slope doth stand, 
It bears an antique shape; 
Waters from the mountain-land 
Seem happy to escape, 
And, rushing by the old mill's wheel, 
Causing it to grind. 
Bound madly on the vale beyond, 
A 
level there to find. 
The race now o'er, with calmness 
Into a 
lake the water flows, 
And, mingling with the tranquil flood, 
Seeks peace in sweet repose. 
The bright sunbeams then visiting 
This realm to Somnus given, 
The tiny globes in vapors rise 
To space above in heaven. 
Once in air, they congregate, 
Fantastic clouds to be, 
And, wafted by the summer breeze, 
Float off most gracefully. 
Soon the mountain tops are reached, 
Ere they cling for rest; 
Each rugged peak is hid from view, 
Each in vapor dressed. 
At morn the clouds would fain ascend, 
And leave this dreary plain; 
But, chilled through by the frigid air, 
Condensed, they fall in rain. 
As the pearly drops alight, 
They dance about with glee, 
For are they not of earth again, 
Just as they used to be? 
They prance, they skip, and race along. 
O'er pebbled brook and rill— 
When lo! they reach familiar ground, 
And pass the same old mill. 
In doing so they turn the wheel, 
With sparkling spray o'ercast, 
Thus proving that the mill does grind 
With water that has past. 
Philosophically the lesson's taught, 
Bidding us beware, 
Although a 
chance unheeded pass, 
Not to incite despair. 
Labor on with redoubled zeal, 
Lost hours to redeem, 
And teach your conscience thus to feel, 
That things are what they seem. 
Opportunities appearing lost, 
And numbered with the slain, 
By providential agencies 
Will surely come again. 
Now bear in mind, although the Fates 
Your hopes continually blast, 
Kind Nature's mill will grind vain 
With watet that has past.

A 
Dog For Sale. 
A story told by DAN [COLV ER. 
It does not make any difference whether your name is 
Keyser or not; if you want to buy a 
dog, there is one for sale 
cheap on a 
canal boat, now braying the billows somewhere 
east of Frankfort. 
The captain of the boat is an Oswego 
inan, and it is but one short week since he spliced the main-
brace, and let out the reefs in his driver, and got three sheets 
in the wind and made all necessary preparations for a 
pros-
perous voyage. 
His wife sang, " Write me a 
letter, love, ' in 
the cabin, his children played on deck, his steeds aired their 
frames on the tow-path, his hand was on the rudder, and his 
mate was just recovering from his farewell attack of delirium 
tremens in the forward cabin. 
The captain gazed proudly 
around him, and could think of nothing else to complete his 
happiness; but his wife, wiser than him, thought they needed 
a 
dog—a 
nice Newfoundland to play with the children, fish 
them out when they fell in the canal„and watch the deck 
hands when the captain was off after groceries. 
Coming through West Utica, recently, the captain bought a 
nice Newfoundland dog. 
He got him at a 
bargain ; in fact 
he got him for nothing, so to speak, because the man who 
owned the dog was not around when the bargain was made. 
The captain had the dog, but still he was not happy. 
The 
dog had a 
way of barking at passing crafts, and so drew upon 
his captain's boat frequent showers of coal and stove wood, 
and he would dive down the steep cabin steps suddenly and 
upset tn captain's wife. 
Once he lit on the table and spoiled 
a 
pound of butter, in fact he was altogether too playful. 
The captain, who is a 
pious man, tied up and put out his 
plank just east of the city, and started with his children to go 
to the Park, to observe the day, after the manner of this 
27 
vicinity. 
The dog started, too, and as' SOon a he got ort 
shore he began to caper and wag his tail; and so wagged one ' 
of the blessed children flat on its back. 
The baby yelled, 
and the captain made some tender remark as lie set it on its 
precious feet, and some other remarks as he shook his fist at 
the dog. 
The dog misliderstood the man and came running 
back full of fun and made a 
jump to lick his face. 
He missed 
the man but he knocked the other child into the canal,, and 
the father, without waiting to make any remarks, jumped in 
after it. 
The dog, being to the water born, knew just what 
to do, and he went cavorting off to get a 
good headway, bark--
ing to himself at every jump, and just as the man got to the top' 
of the water with the darling child, the dog took a 
flying leap• 
of about twenty feet, and struck on the top of the man. 
Well, 
the water that man spurted around was boiling hot with the 
oaths he sputtered with it, and his wife pranced around on 
If 
the deck of the boat, and flung a 
pole to the old man, which 
the dog promptly dragged and pulled ashore, and that captain 
was nearly drowned before he trod the sod again. 
The dog is an intelligent animal—very intelligent indeed— 
and just as soon as he saw that mariner's face, he knew that 
something was wrong, so he slunk up the plank on board. 
The captain gathered what loose granite and lumber he could 
in a 
hurried but earnest search, and marched up the plank, the 
grimmest figure of Neptune ever done in Mohawk Valley mud. 
As soon as he got aboard, he opened a 
hot fire on the dog, and 
that sagacious brute went yelping through the forward hatch, 
and struck in the bunk, where the mate lay musing about the 
devil. 
When the mate saw the dog, he thought the evil one had 
come for him sure enough, and he braced himself for one last 
fight, so that when the captain jumped down in the pursuit of 
the dog, there was a 
mutual misunderstanding all around. 
The captain's wife looked down and tried to explain, but 
there was a 
confused whirlpool of bunk boards and hair and 
bedding, and legs and arms, with an occassionai infusion 
1

dog, but it seemed idle to waste her breath in talking to such 
a 
circus. 
To-day the bow of that fatal craft cuts the waters solemnly, 
and at the helm stands the wreck of that captain, fastened 
together with strips of plaster and welling of liniment, and 
ever and anon he surrenders the rudder to his wife, while he 
goes forward to hammer a 
dejected dog, which is for sale, or 
to listen to the ravings of a 
maniac confined under the forward 
hatch. 
Composition on a 
Wheelbarrow. 
BY DAN COLLYER. 
If you have occasion to use a 
wheelbarrow, leave it, when 
you are through with it, in front of the house, with the handles 
toward the door. A wheelbarrow is the most complicated 
thing to fall over on the face of the earth. A man would fall 
over one when he would never think of falling over anything 
else. 
He never knows when he has got through falling over 
it, either; for it will tangle his legs and his arms, turn over 
with him and rear up in front of him, and just as he pauses 
in his profanity to congratulate himself, it takes a 
new turn 
and scoops more skin off him, and he commences to evolute 
anew, and bump himself on fresh places. A man never 
ceases to fall over a 
wheelbarrow until it turns completely on 
its back, and brings up against something it cannot upset. 
It is the most inoffensive looking object there is, but it is 
more dangerous than a 
locomotive, and no man is secure 
with one, unless he has tight hold of its handles, and is sitting 
down on something. A 
wheelbarrow has its uses, without a 
doubt, but in its leisure moments it is the great blighting 
curse on true dignity. 
Dan Collyer's' Bull Dog. 
29 
Written by SAM DEVERE, and sung with great success by DAN COLIN= 
Old Dan Collyer had a 
bull dog, 
He was bred of the good old stock; 
For twenty-seven hours a 
battle he fought— 
I'm telling you the truth by the clock. 
His tail was a 
neat little bit of a 
stump, 
Bow-legged, with two crooked eyes; 
One look of his little pug nose was enough, 
He was the devil himself in disguise. 
He had all the neighbors crazy, so he did, 
With his treacherous, villainous tricks; 
They tried for to kill him with pistols and guns, 
And they flung at him thousands of bricks. 
A 
murdering villain he was, to be sure, 
His equal there never was found, 
For he took Mr. Kelly's pig by the ear, 
And he dragged him all over the ground. 
He tore all the tails off my Sunday coat, 
Eat the bustle off Mary Ann Finn, 
And he run betwixt young Kitty Mulligan's legs, 
Now wasn't that truly a 
sin ? 
He caught up the little Dutch shoemaker's dog, 
And he shook him around like a 
rat; 
He murdered McMulligan's beautiful goat, 
And he eat up Mrs. Hennessy's cat.

TEMPERANCE SPEECH, 
BURLESQUE ON JOHN B. GOUGH'S SPEECH. 
Delivered by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
I 
yin now make a few remarks on demperance. 1 
am no 
drinking man, never having drank a 
drop of liquor in my life— 
dot I 
paid for. 
I 
am no orator, but shall try to represend dot 
greed demperance orator, John B. Gough, a 
man whom I've of-
den been daken for. 
Should I 
possess the eloquery,, of Gen-
eral Grant, I 
could give more scope to de subject I 
am now 
aboud to wrestle mit. 
Demperance is an old und veil vorn subject, but like a 
Kenc. 
box ye can shake it ub, und get anoder number. 
It's very hard to approach a 
man vat ain't a-drinking; you're 
apt to be met with—" Who tole you I 
vasn't drinking ?"— 
" 
You mind your business, nnd I'll mind yours."—" Come und 
take a 
ball," und oder veil-known expressions used by politi-
cians. 
I 
vas called upon vonce to see vone of de hardest cases of 
demperance it has ever been my good fortune to vitness. 
A 
man, who yen drunk vos de kindest of husbands; but ven sober 
he vos a 
perfect devil. 
I 
vent to de house, a 
beautiful brown 
curb-stone front, knocked de door down, und vent in. 
De man 
vos dere. 
I 
said to him—" Viii you please give me a 
drink of 
vater ?"—(de firsd dime I 
ever dook vater in my hie.) 
He said, 
" 
Yes, sir; have a 
seat," pointing to a 
red-hot sdove. I 
de-
clined to sit, for various reasons. I 
spoke to him aboud Infle-
ction, Seven Oud, but I 
avoided c
.
le subject of demperance. 
At 
'T 
last I 
said, " You have a 
vife, I 
believe ?" 
He replied, " Yea, 
sir; de fifth one; red-headed." 
I 
said, " You love your vile, 
don't you ?" 
He said, " Veil, id's unnatural for a 
man to love 
his vile now-a-days." I 
said, " Don'd you dink of you vould 
sign dis paper, und go und get full vid me to-night, you could 
come home, get a 
club, imd have a 
good deal of fun around de 
house ?" 
He said, " Yes, I 
suppose so." I 
said, " You'll do 
Id?" 
He said, " I 
till." 
I 
pulled oud a 
coby of" Good-Look-
ing Snow," I 
laid id on de dable; he placed his hose in the ink-
bottle, und wrote his name. 
Just den a 
voice came from anoder room—(full of emodion 
und beer)—" Luke Gerloot1" 
De man said, " Come in mit me, 
Mr. Whooping-cough." I 
vent in dere, und his vile vos laying 
on a 
bed, she vos dead—drunk. 
He knelt down und printed a 
kiss on her forehead in large types. 
She took his foot in her 
hand, looked up, und said, " Oh 1 
Luke is such a 
good husband 
yen he's drunk, but ven sober, he's N. G 
1" (de first time I 
ever 
knew she spoke Latin.) 
De man said, " She says I 
am good 1" 
at de same time pulling down de neck of his shirt, he showed 
me a 
second-hand scar. 
I 
said, " Vere you vaccinated dere?" 
His vife said, " I 
cannot tell a 
lie, I 
done it mit a 
little hatchet." 
Of my lips had been dry yen I 
came in dere, I 
assure you dey

alvays carry de stuff mit me. 
But dis is

Add Ryman's Celebrated 4th of July Oration. 
It is useless and more than foolish to enter into prefatory 
remarks explanatory of the origin, growth and pedigree of the 
Fourth of July. 
That it was born of poor and honest parents, 
is a 
fact known io us all. 
That it's birth gave us freedom there 
can be no doubt. 
That that freedom inspired us with enter-
prise and industry make no blooming error 
That industry 
and enterprise has made us the greatest nation the sun ever shone 
on, you can bet your bottom dollar. 
And in how short a 
time? 
How rapid have been the strides of improvement. 
Rivers that 
but yesterday rolled from the icy north to the tropical south, 
whose surfaces were only disturbed by the Indian's canoe, to-
day are full of flat-boats and stern-wheel-steamers. 
In the lan-
guage 02 the 
t,Poet— 
Behind the redman's bark canoe, 
The steamboat puffs and raves, 
And city lots are advertised for sale, 
Above old Indians' graves. 
Hey! 
Where was this city two hundred years ago? 
Where was it ? 
Was it where she now stands ? No, my hearers, it was not. But 
on this spot the war-whoop of the Indian chief might have been 
heard to echo and reecho from Woodbine Cottage to the Jersey 
Ferry. 
But where is the war-whoop now ? 
It has passed into 
the dim distance, and to-day as you walk down Broadway 
instead of being greeted with the war-whoop of the Indian 
chief, all you hear is: 
How is the old thing working? 
But 
we know how it is ourselves. 
We know that as a 
people 
we are huge. 
We have everything to be proud of. 
We have 
a 
President that can smoke more cigars, make longer excur-
sions and shorter speeches, catch more trout and allow the 
American Flag to ask more apologies than any other ruler on 
the face of tin; earth. 
We have men in our Halls of Congress 
who would sacrifice their lives rather than rob the government of 
1 
83 
anything 
They couldn't get away with, and it we keep On 
progressing as we have been in the last few years, there will be 
nothing left of the Old Constitution but the Freedmen's Bureau, 
Woman's Suffrage and the 15th Amendment. 
Ain't we huge? 
I 
tell you we're business. We're the most peaceful when abused 
and the most warlike when let alone of any people on the earth. 
We had a 
standing challenge in the Clipper for years and years. 
No nation took it up, so we took it up ourselves. 
We had a 
fight in our own family just to 3how outsiders how we could 
make the fur fly. But the cruel was is over and how our hearts 
beat with joy, our bosoms heaved with emotion to see our 
brothers and friends after their long, tedious marches and hard 
fought battles, returning home 
from Canada. 
Yes, my friends, the war is over and the Star Spangled Banner 
still floats triumphant. 
We still celebrate the Anniversary of 
the Declaration of Independence. 
And the bald-headed eagle 
has perched himself on the snow-capped summits of the Mocky 
Rountains, flapping his wings, spreading his tail feathers, bid-
ding defiance to the world and spiling for a 
muss. 
But he'll 
never spile, he's not long to wait. 
We are on the eve of a 
great war, which if not stopped will cause rivers of blood to 
flow. 
I 
fancy I 
hear you asking yourselves, what will cause 
this war? I 
will tell you. 
During the last three years there 
has been more emigration to this country than there has been 
during the last three years. 
Scarcely a 
ship arrives but that 
brings from twenty-five to one hundred Italian organ-grinders, 
sent to this country by Italy to make harmony between the two 
great nations, but how are they treated, how are Italians treat-
ed in this country ? Calumniously. Have we commissioners ap-
pointed to show them around, to take them by the hand and 
guard them against the pitfalls and allurements that beset their 
path to lead them astray ? 
No, in Italic, No. 
Why it was only 
two days, three weeks and four months ago that an Italian 
friend of mine, an organ-grinder by profession, landed in this 
your beautiful city of New York. How was he received ? Who 
was there to take him by the hand and show him round among 
34 
the gang? Noboby, not tven " Nobody's Daughter ' 
What 
was the consequences? 
He stood grinding his organ three 
days and three nights, in front of a 
Deaf and Dumb Asylum. Its 
enough to bust up any business. 
And it is likely to cause war 
between this country and Italy. 
Let us prevetit it, " Let us 
have peace," for, as Gen. Grant says, the country is in no con-
dition to fight and he wouldn't say so unless he was paid for 
it. 
But I'll detain you no longer, hoping you may all live for 
many years to fire your crackers and shout for the " Star Ban-
glett Smasher." The Fourth of July and the Dec--le—pru---denco 
of In—dig—na—tiou. I 
bid you a-jew, a---street jut. 
Biddy Muldoon. 
As sung with great success by DAN COLLYER. 
Now, Biddy, I 
see you a-peepin' so sly, 
The stars are a-looking from out of the sky, 
The nightingale warbles his purtiest tune, 
He knows I 
am lovin' you, Biddy Muldoon. 
The grass it is wet, and I'm catchin' a 
cold, 
And, Biddy, now don't you be thinking me bold, 
Just open the dure and I'll go away soon, 
For I'm crazy wid love of you, Biddy Muldoon.. 
CHORUS. 
Biddy, Biddy, Biddy Muldoon, 
Open the window and look at the moon ; 
I'd knock any man in the middle of June, 
If I 
caught him a 
courtin' you, Biddy Muldoon. 
Now, Biddy, my darlin, you're laughing, I'm sure, 
Oh come down, my jewel, and open the dure; 
Would you let a 
man fraze, on an evenin' in June, 
When you could revive him, dear Biddy Muldoon. 
If the old man's awake, bless the name that he bears, 
He'd think it's a 
rat, that is stealing up stairs ; 
'Twould be a 
good joke on the swate old gossoon, 
For he won't know I'm eourtin' you, Biddy Muldoon.

BILLY BARRY'S PINAFORE. 
Composed, and sung with great success .by the Great 
Billy Barry. 
I 
am the monarch of Limburger cheese, 
When I 
eat, it's go as you please; 
I 
wear piccadilly's and tight- legged pants, 
And so does my sisters, cousins and my aunts. 
Now I 
think that it's awfully mean, 
To treat a 
girl to ice cream, 
When you've only got a 
half-a-dollar in your pants, 
And she invites all her sisters, her cousins and her aunts. 
Henry Ward Beecher is a 
fine plum, 
He says that he never drinks rum, 
But he'll kiss a 
pretty girl when he gets a 
chance, 
And he'll never tell his sisters, cousins or his aunts, 
I 
am a

All the Irish will be there; 
Oh, such howling and such growling, 
And such cutting up so quare; 
All the Cork and Kerry people 
That resides in New York Town; 
Wearing high hats like a

All the gang will sure be down. 
CHORUS: 
All the Irish will be there, 
Bring along your Bridget fair; 
Make her wear her Sunday hair, 
When in the set she's dancing; 
Won't there be a

When the gang gets in a 
row; 
None but buffaloes will be there, 
At Casey's Tin Pan Wedding. 
There will be ale, stale beer and whisky, 
Goose chowder and cat pie; 
And when Casey he gets tipsy, 
He will slug Riley in the eye; 
Old Pat Shay and Tim Maloney, 
From the town of Donnegal; 
Danced a 
reel for stale bologna, 
Qn the top of Casey's wall.

Cuckoo! cuckoo! 
I

Hear the cuckoo call, 
Oh, hear him calling now! 
Oh, sadly the cuckoo is calling now, 
I 
hear him far up in the ruins so gray, 
And softly the moonbeams are falling now 
O'er slumbering blossoms of May. 
Soft lilies and the rose 
Wave in the valleys green; 
Sad spirits yearn for their lost love, 
While beautiful shamrock grows. 
Oh, sadly the cuckoo is calling now, 
I 
hear him far up in the ruins so gray, 
And softly the moonbeams are falling now 
O'er slumbering blossoms of May. 
The blue birds do sing with a 
merry trill; 
Their glad notes sound clear thro' the green woodland 
bowers, 
But the cuckoo's call is so sad and still, 
It comes in the twilight's lone hours. 
Soft lilies and the roses 
Wave in the valleys green; 
Sad spirits yearn for their lost love, 
While beautiful shamrock grows. 
Oh, sadly the cuckoo is calling now, 
I 
hear him far up in the ruins so gray, 
And softly the moonbeams are falling now

Oh, scorn not moments made for love and thee.

Come, my love, and gaily dance around.

Two pretty little arms that 'round my neck entwine, 
Two ruby lips, my love, that warmly kiss, my love; 
Two pretty eyes of azure blue like thine.

Music to be had at Mrs. P. LIEDER'S Music House, 60 Chatham Street,

Can you so soon forget me, 
You loved me once so well; 
You loved me in the Summertime, 
The Wintertime as well; 
You said you would never leave me, 
My love you would never forget; 
And often in our tales of love, 
I 
called you my dearest pet. 
CHORUS: 
In the evening when 'twas twilight, 
You've often sat beside me; 
Whispering love, my turtle dove, 
Can you so soon forget me; 
I'm fading like the flowers, 
That blushed and bloomed in Summer 
Dear is the vision that merrily recalls, 
Can you forget me so soon? 
Then my heart shall feel no trouble, 
My head shall feel no pain; 
Only to see thee, darling, 
And hear thy voice again. 
Just to press thy ruby lips, 
Your sunny face I 
see; 
Don't forget me, darling, 
Can you so soon forget me?

MODERN SWELL" OF ERIN. 
Written, Composed and Sung by HARRY W HALING at 
TONY PASTOR'S THEATRE, 
Good evening, boys, you don't know me, 
As you've not seen me before; 
I'm a 
gentleman you all can tell, 
From Erin's lovely shore; 
So if you will just list to me, 
I'll make you understand; 
A 
few things that some here don't know, 
Of my own dear native land. 
CHORUS: 
Then for wit, good nature, 
Where's the men to beat those from our Soil? 
They're ever frisky, ever gay, 
And willing hard to toil; 
They'll shake a 
stranger by the hand, 
And greet him with a 
smile; 
These are the sort of men you'll find. 
If you visit Erin's Isle. 
I've heard you call us ragged Pat, 
And dirty Irish, too; 
But we can dress in pomp and style, 
Ah! just as well as you; 
We've gained respect through all the world, 
And on every distant shore— 
They praise " O'Connell," " Goldsmith," 
And our late " Sir Thomas Moore."

AN IRISHMAN'S TOAST. 
A 
VIOLET FROM MOTHER'S GRAVE, 
As sung with great success by TONY PASTOR. The greatest and 
most popular song in New York. 
Don't call me weak-minded, perchance I 
should sing, 
Of the dearest old spot upon earth; 
And don't think me foolish should memory bring, 
To my mind the dear land of my birth; 
With its hills and its valleys, its mountains and vales, 
Of which our forefathers would boast; 
Of a 
dear little island all covered with green, 
Ah, but list' and I'll give you an Irishman's toast. 
Here's to the land of the shamrock so green, 
Here's to each boy and his darling colleen, 
Here's to the ones we love dearest and most, 
May God speed old Ireland, that's an Irishman's toast. 
My mind's eye oft pictures my old cabin home, 
Where it stood by the murmuring rill, 
Where my playmates and I 
oft together did roam, 
Through the castle that stood on the hill; 
But the stout hand of time has destroyed the old cot, 
And the farm now lies barren and bare; 
Around the old porch there is ivy entwined, 
But the birds seem to warble this toast in the air. 
(Chorus). 
The church and the schoolhouse have long been replaced, 
In the Harp Hotel dwells a 
new host; 
The white-haired old veteran has long been at rest, 
And his wife has deserted her post; 
King Death, the stern reaper, has called them away, 
And their children have gone o'er the seas; 
There is nothing but strangers around the old spot. 
Still this toast seems to waft to my ears on the breeze. 
(Chorus). 
Words and Music by W ILL H. Fos, 
Sung by W M. McALoori in all the principal Theatres in America, and 
by O'NEIL & CONROY. 
Scenes of my childhood arise before my gaze, 
Bringing recollections of my childhood's happy days; 
When down in the meadow in childhood I 
would roam ? 
But there's no one left to cheer now within my good 
old home; 
Father and Mother they have passed away, 
Sister and Brother are laid beneath the clay; 
But while life does remain, there's one thing 
retain, 
A 
small Violet I 
plucked from Mother's Grave. 
CHORUS: 
Only a 
Violet I 
plucked when but a 
boy, 
And often when I'm sad at heart, this plant has 
give me joy; 
But while life does remain, in memorium I'll retain, 
That small violet I 
plucked from Mother's Grave , 
How well I 
remember my dear old Mother's smile, 
As she used to greet me when I 
returned from toil; 
Always knitting in the old arm chair, 
Father used to sit and read for all us children there; 
But now all -is silent around the good old home, 
They all have left me in sorrow for to roam; 
While life does remain, there's one thing I'll retain, 
A 
small Violet I 
plucked from Mother's Grave.

My name is O'Brien from Harlem, 
An Irishman as you can see; 
I 
can sing like a 
thrush or a 
starling, 
Or the little bird up in a 
tree. 
But the gang that stands there on the corner, 
Are trying the steps and the dance; 
And they shout out whenever I'm passing, 
There's O'Brien with his high-water pants. 
CHORUS: 
They tell me to go over to England, 
And pay a 
short visit to France; 
And there to bring out my new fashions, 
And call them the high-water pants. 
Last week I 
went to the theatre, 
Along with my first cousin Dan; 
We hired a 
seat down in the parquette, 
Behind the big man in the band. 
When a 
pager came out with a 
banjo, 
lie played up a 
high-land clog dance; 
And he gave out a 
gag and a 
con-nun-drum, 
'Bout O'Brien and his high-water pants. 
CLorus, 
One night as I 
strolled down the Bowery, 
Along with a 
friend, Paddy Brock. 
We tho't we'd just drop into Geoghan's, 
To try some of his rye and rock. 
When the gang all cried there's Dan O'Leary, 
The bar-keeper shot me a 
glance; 
" 
Howld your tongues " then said he to the loafers 
That's O'Brien with his high-water pants.

THE WATERMILL. 
As recited by Gus VirthisAltS, at the Olympic Theatre. 
Listen to the watermill, through the livelong day, 
How the clicking of its wheel wears the hours away, 
Languidly the autumn wind stirs the greenwood leaves, 
From the fields the reapers sing, binding up the sheaves; 
And a 
proverb haunts my mind, as a 
spell is cast— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Autumn winds revive no more leaves that once are shed, 
And he sickle cannot reap corn once gathered; 
And the rippling stream flows on, tranquil, deep and still, 
Never gliding back again to the watermill. 
Truly speaks the proverb old, witlt a 
meaning vast— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Take the lesson to thyself, loving heart and true, 
Golden years are fleeting by, youth is passing, too; 
Learn to make the most of life, lose no happy day, 
Time will never bring thee back chances swept away. 
Leave no tender word unsaid, love, while love shall last— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Work while yet the daylight shines, man of strength and will, 
Never does the streamlet glide useless by the mill; 
Wait not till to-morrow's sun beams upon the way, 
All that thou canst call thine own lies in thy— to- day, 
Power, intellect and health may not always last— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Oh the wasted hours of life that have drifted by, 
Oh! the good we might have done, lost without a 
sigh! 
Love that we might once have saved by a 
single word, 
Thoughts conceived, but never penned, perishing unheard, 
Take the proverb to thine heart, take and hold it fast— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Oh! love thy God and fellow-man, thyself consider last, 
For come it will, when thou must scan dark errors of the past; 
And when the fight of life is o'er, and earth recedes from view, 
And Heaven in all its glory shines, 'midst the pure, the good 
the true. 
Then you'll see more clearly the proverb deep and vast— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past.

And gets drunk on German wine.

Her features are like her pa.

An engagement for life she has signed, 
She is hitched to a 
man named Freddie McCan, 
He has a 
million dollars in his mind.

Wenches on Our Block. 
Written by Bon SHIMMER. Sung by PETTIT and W HITE in the principal 
Variety Theatres in the Canary Islands. - 
If you want for information, just list to what I 
say, 
And I'll tell all about the wenches up our way. 
They're dirty and they're greasy, each face would stop a 
clock, 
There ne'er was such a 
terrible gang as the wenches on our block 
There's dirty Lize, big-foot Sal, and cross-eyed Sarah Jane; 
There's bow-legged Sue and pug-nose Loo, and some without 
a 
name. 
They'll cut you with a 
razor, they'll hit you with a 
rock— 
And that's the way the wenches fight a 
living on our block. 
CHORUS. 
Little Sally Snodgrass, playing in the mud, 
When they want to wash her they throw her in a 
tub. 
They throw her on a 
line to dry, and wipe her with a 
frock, 
That,s what you'll see the wenches do a 
living on our block. 
They stand upon the corner und fight about their beaux., 
They always have a 
big black eye or else a 
broken nose. 
They work and get a 
dollar a 
day, and hide it in their sock, 
And that's the way the wenches act a 
living on our block. 
When they fight they will bite, and gouge out your eye, 
And they'll cut and they'll but, and fight till they die. 
They drink coal oil and alcohol, or anything that's hot, 
And now you know a 
thing or two of the wenches on out 
block.

And the neighbors all say as they pass by our door, 
They never heard laughing so hearty before.

Kind friends, we advise you to laugh and grow fat, 
Now you certainly will pay attention to that; 
To laugh and be jolly like my wife and I, 
Is a

We'll get home by and by, 
Little children can't you hold on, hold on, 
We'll land on Canaan's shore, 
Sunday morning. 
Hold your light, Monday morning, 
Hold your light, Tuesday morning, 
hold your light on Mount Calvary. 
Hold your light, Monday morning'

Yaller Dog's Love For a 
Nigger. 
Recitation, as delivered by FRANK eUSTIMAN. 
Dar's a 
lone grave on de oder side of de creek 
Dat knows no Decoration Day, 
For him who over yonder sleeps 
Is only a 
Nigger, dey say! 
Dey gave him his freedom, but took away his home, 
lie died an old vagrant, entirely unknown, 
And left not a 
soul to be sad 
But an ole yaller dog—'twas all dat he had. 
Dey dug a 
rude hole and chucked him away, 
Dis poor ole colored slave; 
Not a 
prayer for his rest did anyone say, 
And dat ole yaller dog lay down on his grave, 
And dar you can see him day after day, 
At morning, at eve and at noon; 
But dar's no inducements can drive him away 
From his place beside de grave of a 
coon. 
Dar's a 
mighty Brie monument close by, - 
But to me dis little mound looks bigger; 
For dar's a 
monument money can't buy— 
A 
yaller dog's love for a 
nigger.

THE OLD WOODEN ROCKER. 
Words and Music by FLORENCE H ARPER.. 
Music published by SPEAR & DENnoFr, New York, and sent postpaid 
on receipt of 40 cents. 
Copyright, 1878, by HARRISON M ILLARD. 
Sung with tremendous success by W. FRED AYMAR, America's 
Greatest Grotesque Clown. 
There it stands in the corner with its back to the wall, 
The old wooden rocker so stately and tall; 
With naught to disturb it but the duster or broom. 
For no one now uses that back parlor room; 
Oh, how well I 
remember in days long gone by, 
When we stood by that rocker, my sister and I; 
And we listened to the stories that our grandma would tell 
By that old wooden rocker we all loved so well. 
CHORUS: 
As she sat by the fire she would rock, rock, rock, 
And we heard but the tick of the old brass clock; 
Eighty years she had sat in that chair grim and tall, 
In that old wooden rocker that stood by the wall. 
If this chair could but speak, oh, the tales it could tell, 
How poor aged grandpa in fierce battle fell; 
'Neath the stars and the stripes he fought bravely and true 
He cherished his freedom, the red, white and blue; 
It could tell of bright days and of dark ones, beside, 
Of the day when dear grandma stood forth as a 
bride; 
This is why we all love it, this old chair grim and tall, 
The old wooden rocker that stands by the wall. 
(Chorus) 
But poor grandma is gone, and her stories are done, 
Her children have followed her, yes, one by one; 
They have all gone to meet her " in the sweet by and-bye," 
And all that is left is dear sister and I; 
Never more will we hide her gold specks or her cap, - 
Never more will we tease her while taking her nap; 
Never more will she slumber in that chair grim and tall, 
The old wooden rocker that stood by the wall. 
(Chorus),

McCORMICK'S MULE. 
Written by JAMES RICHMOND. 
Recited by PAT ROONEY with great success. 
McCormick had a 
Jack-ass, 
Blind in the teeth, lame in one eye; 
He had a 
celebrated record, 
For eating water and drinking pie; 
This Jack-ass was a 
high kicker, 
lie won many an undisputed prize; 
He kicked out seven rows of Mrs. Murphy's teeth, 
And jabbed out both her eyes. 
McCormick's Mule. 
This mule was born in Ireland, 
lie wears the Shamrock on his nose; 
At the Centennial he stole an iron safe, 
And dressed himself in a 
suit of clothes; 
He broke into a 
Jewelry store, 
Stabbed the proprietor with a 
nail; 
Chased four Policeman into the river, 
And set fire to the Jail. 
McCormick's Mule. 
McCormick was arrested, and produced the mule, 
For him all the neighbors had a 
grudge; 
lie slapped the Jury in the mouth with his tail, 
And kicked the neck-tie off the Judge; 
The mule escaped, and they held McCormick, 
For the doings of the mule he was tried; 
He was just getting ten years' sentenee, 
When a 
telegram came the mule had died. 
McCormick's Mule.

Moral on his Grave- Stone. 
Judge me as a 
Jack-ass, 
Or judge me as a 
fool; 
I 
was smarter than some politicians, 
That went to Grammar School: 
I 
had the brains of a 
mighty man, 
But for one I 
could not pass; 
So please have printed on my grave, 
McCormick's little Jack-ass.

SWEET FORGET-ME-NOT.

No. 50 West 4th Street, Cincinnati, Ohio, can be 
obtained at any Music Store. Price, 40 cents. 
fancy brings a 
thought to me 
Of flowers sweet and rare, 
With grace and beauty there combined, 
And brightest hues so fair— 
So like a 
maiden that I 
loved— 
It was my happy lot: 
I 
whispered when we parted last— 
" 
Oh you'll forget me not! " 
CHORUS. 
Graceful and as charming as a 
lily in the pond— 
Time has passed so swiftly—for, of her I 
am so fond--
Dasies and the roses, too, they grow around the spot 
Where we parted and I 
whispered— 
" 
You'll forget me not! " 
(Dance) 
We met—I 
really don't know where— 
But still 'tis all the same— 
For love walks in the busy streets 
As well as in the lane: 
I 
gently pressed her tiny hand: 
She glanced at me a 
shot— 
She dropped a 
flower, I 
picked it up— 
A sweet forget-me-not 
(Chorus and Dance.) 
At last there came a 
happy day 
And something that I 
said 
Just caused her lips to murmur " ves I " 
And shortly we were wed. 
A 
little cottage by the brook, 
And a 
tiny garden spot 
Where grows a 
little flower called— 
A sweet forget-me-not! 
,(Chorus and Dance.)

WHAT I'D ADVISE YOU TO DO. 
Written and Sung by M R. HARRY -W HALING With great success a) 
TONY PASTOR'S THEATRE. 
Some advice I 
will give you, if you will list to me, 
On the way to get on in this land; 
If you're wealthy don't sneer at a 
man when he's down, 
For we all on life's wheel have to stand; 
And as it moves round, none of us can tell, 
How soon we may stumble and fall; 
Then, tvhen too late, to your sorrow you'll find, 
The weakest must go to the wall. 
Chorus— So ne'er be too selfish, nor yet be too proud, 
As this world you go travelling through; 
If your wealthy why stretch out your hand to 
a 
friend, 
That's what I'd advise you to do. 
There are men in this world who are well-off and great 
And they have heaps of gold hoarded away; 
They ne'er are contented though riches their lot, 
But they crave on for more day by day; 
But when summoned away by the grim captain death, 
Or their tombs they grow feeble and old: 
Had they but their time to live over again, 
They freely would give up their gold. 
Chortes. 
Penny-wise and pound-foolish is a 
maxim you've heard, 
And I 
firmly believe it is true; 
For there lot's of young sparks get money in hearts, 
And with it don't know what to do; 
They'll refuse a 
poor man who asked for a 
coin, 
Ills fiimily from hunger to save; 
And spend all they have on debauchery and drink, 
Which quickly sends them to their grave. 
Chorus. 
Speak well of the bridge that carries you o'er, 
You may one day have to cross it again; 
If today you're blessed with the rays of the sun, 
To- morrow may drown you in rain; 
If you're cosey and warm and not out in the storm, 
And you see a 
friend naked and bare; 
Oh ne'er let hint pass by or at him look shy, 
Of your shelter pray give him a 
share. 
Chorus.

I WANT TO SEE THE OLD HOME. 
Words by FRANK DUMONT. 
Music by J'. E. STEWART. 
The Music of this song is published by J. L. 
PETERS, 599 
Broadway, New York. 
Price 30 cents. 
I've wandered very far away 
From the clime where I 
was born, 
And my poor heart has been so sad, 
Dejected and forlorn ; 
No master kind to treat me well, 
To cheer me when in pain, 
I 
want to see the cotton fields, 
And the dear old home again. 
CHORUS. 
Oh the good old days are passed and gone, 
I 
sigh for them in vain; 
want to see the cotton fields, 
And the dear old home again. 
I'm left all sad and lonely now, 
When my days are very few, 
My wife and children both are gone, 
I 
don't know what to do; 
My master too, he may be dead, 
His hair was turning gray, 
01), let me see that good old home, 
Before I 
pass away. 
Oh, the good old days, eta. 
When I 
was free I 
left that land, 
Where the days are bright and fair, 
Where missus spoke tone so kind, 
When I 
was bowed with care; 
I 
left that home no friends to find, 
My heart was filled with pain, 
Oh, take me to that good old home, 
To see it once again.

"ANTI-FAT TWINS." 
As performed by Jonxsox & PowEus, of the SAN FRANCISCO MIN. 
STELS, with great success. 
We're full of joy and glee to-day, 
And as frisky as a 
mule; 
We heard the bell—now don't you tell— 
We ran away from school. 
Our A B 
C's we know with ease, 
And c-a-t 
spells cat; 
We are so stout we waddle about, 
And we're taking Anti-Fat. 
. CHOR178: 
We float around like big balloons, 
But yet we never will complain; 
We dance and sing, and then we swing 
All day in the shady lane. 
The neighbors all do loudly bawl 
When we climb their fences no matter how tall; 
And down the apples and peaches do fall, 
When into their orchards we make a 
call. 
We never study so very hard, 
For a 
dunce we'd rather be; 
And on a 
stool we stand in school 
No books for him and me. 
We are too fat to learn to spell, 
We never will be wise; 
We 
sit all day in the sun and play 
At baking and making mud pies.

The Greatest Trick Book of the Age. 
IT PLEASES BOTH OLD AND YOUNG, 
It is a Fac simile of a Trick practiced by ali 
the Professors of Magic. 
It is arranged so systematically, and is accom-
panied with directions so plainly written„ that, with 
a 
single perusal, any person may become an adept 
in an unfailing source of amusement. 
Read what a leading Journal says of it: 
" 
An ingenious little book of the thaumaturgic order 
has been sent us, called HIIMPTY DIIMPTY,' and bound 
in such a 
way as to give opportunity for a 
decidedly 
puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary appear-
ance of a 
child's picture-book, gayly printed and colored, 
it is so bound that a 
practiced manipulator, taking it 
up, and flirting the leaves rapidly over, can make it ap-
pear to be filled with copies of only one picture, or with 
blank pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of 
figures. 
One minute the pamphlet, quickly thumbed, 
appears to contain nothing but portraits of Harlequin, 
in his tesselated suit; the next, only Columbine; then, 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or Mephisto-
pheles. A little practice, and the directions printed 
with the book will make anybody at _ home in the hand-
ling of it."—Phila. Evening Bulletin.
