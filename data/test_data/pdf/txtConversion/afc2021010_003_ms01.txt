Musician and Augusta Heritage Center Artistic Director Emily Miller of Elkins, West Virginia had put 
me in touch with Jim Bibey, who had been Emily’s postmaster when she lived in Valley Bend. Bibey (b. 
1952, Barbour County, West Virginia) worked for the United States Postal Service from 1989-2015, at 
various post offices in West Virginia including Cass, Elkins, and Valley Bend. He has been a clerk, 
postmaster, and carrier. Bibey took a federal retirement from the Postal Service in 2015. Bibey is also an 
amateur musician.

JB: James "Jim" Bibey 
EH: Emily Hilliard 
 
00:00 
EH: Alright, so why don't you introduce yourself and let's see--tell me your name and where you're from 
and what year you were born. 
 
JB: My name is James Bibey. I was born and raised in Barbour County (West Virginia). Live here in 
Elkins, West Virginia and I was born on [redacted] 1952. 
 
EH: And why don't you tell me a little bit about what you did at the post office for the Postal Service? 
 
JB: I started out at the Postal Service, I believe it was in July of 1989 after trying several years to try to 
get in with the Postal Service. Started out as a PTF Clerk in Burnsville, West Virginia. A year later I was 
able to transfer up to Weston, West Virginia as a full-time clerk and I stayed there for 2 years and then 
was able to transfer back home here to Elkins to the Elkins Post Office. Stayed there for around 7 years, 
either as both as a PTF or part-time flexible clerk or a carrier. I did both and then was able to after about 7 
years, was able to get into my first office as a manager, postmaster in Cass, West Virginia. Stayed there 
for two and a half years, and then wanting to get back closer to home to Elkins, there was an opening at 
the Dailey, West Virginia Post Office, which was the same level. These were Level 11 Post Offices, so I 
asked for a lateral transfer and my district manager at the time agreed to it. So fortunately I was able to go 
from driving about an hour and 15 minutes each way to 10 minutes each way, which was not only 
financially, but physically and mentally a lot better. Stayed there with the intentions of hopefully, 
eventually moving up to a higher level post office. At the time there was an 11 which was pretty much an 
entry level 8 hour office. And then there was a 13 level and 15 level and then 18 and higher. So there was 
a 13 level post office that came upon in Valley Head, West Virginia. I asked for an Officer in Charge 
assignment when that came open, that was granted that, so I was basically just filling in there, and then 
when it did finally get bided out, I bid on it. Received that bid, stayed there for a couple years, and then 
still wanted to get back closer to Elkins. Another same level office came open in Huttonsville. I 
transferred there. Stayed there for several years and finally ended up in Valley Bend, West Virginia for a 
couple years and stayed there for my remaining time in the Post Office. I was there for I think 7-8 years. 
And then they, the Postal Service, in order to cut costs, decided that they was going to reduce the hours on 
post offices. My office got downgraded to a 4-hour a day post office, 6 days a week. I could have stayed 
there for that, but I had the years and age to take a retirement. And at the same time, I thought it was 
maybe time to try something else and so I just, in July or in June of 2015, I took a federal retirement. 
 
04:00  
 
EH: What are the different levels of post offices? 
 
JB: The level determines, or is basically determined by the administrative duties. There's several different 
criteria--administrative duties, number of PO boxes, number of routes, rural routes or highway contract 
routes that are, come out of your office. Size of the office. So they say--there were actually-- I can't 
remember what they called them--there was actually at the time 2, I think, 2 and 4 hour offices. But for a 
full 8 hour office, level 11 was a basic start out.  
 
EH: And so as a postmaster at those offices, you were overseeing rural routes and contractors? 
 
JB: Not all offices have routes out of them. But I say the majority did. You may not be the administrator 
of a route, you may be the intermediate, but basically they would start out of their head-out office, they

would deliver until they got to your office, and then they would get more mail there, case it, take it out, 
deliver it, and some of 'em might have 2-3 different offices on their whole route that they end up going to. 
 
05:24  
 
EH: What was initially appealing to you about working with the Postal Service? 
 
JB: I mean it sounds like kind of a cliche, maybe, but I can remember, I think it was in middle school, I 
believe, or it might have even been before that, that where they have a time where you write down what 
you would like to be. And I can remember putting that I'd like to grow up, and someday I would like to be 
a postmaster. I can remember in the town close to where I grew up in Belington, and Red Payne was the 
postmaster’s name. I can remember going in there and doing business or getting our mail and 
remembering thinking, now there would be a great job to have. And knowing later on growing up, I knew 
it was good money and good benefits and a good retirement. So then again it wasn't real easy to get in 
with the Post Office. I mean you had to take an exam, a test, and make a fairly high score on it. So after 
several tries, I was finally fortunate enough to get in.  
 
EH: His name was Red Payne? 
 
JB: Red Payne. 
 
EH: That's a good name. 
 
JB: Yeah! (laughs)  
 
EH: Why don't you tell me about some of your day-to-day work as a postmaster. 
 
JB: Basically, especially in the smaller offices, they would, there would be a contract route that would 
bring the mail to us. They would drop it off so you first came in, you either, the mail would already be 
there in the vestibule or shortly it would be coming. It would come in tubs or in trays and back when I 
first started, it was before the DPS or Direct Point Sequencing, so it all came in raw, so a big part of your 
morning was casing, separating the mail into either your box section or for the route carrier. Now the 
route carrier would come in later and he actually cased his own mail in his case, so separate it into his 
delivery sequence, so in the meantime you had to separate his mail out of your mail. Then you had to line 
up your box mail to case it, and also you do the same thing with the magazines and the partial post, or the 
packages. So generally like for example in Valley Head, the office I finally retired from, on a given day, 
that was my procedure, and I'd say, probably would  take me on an average an hour and a half to get all 
that separated and boxed. We had to post a box-up time in the lobby, so the carriers would know basically 
what time they should be able to expect their mail to actually be in the boxes and but during the whole 
time, as soon as you opened up your office or your front door, then you had to be waiting on customers at 
the same time. So it could get hectic, especially in a heavy part of the season, like Christmas time. But 
then you would have a lull in the middle of the day, after say 11 o'clock 'til probably about 3 o'clock, you 
were just basically waiting on customers, doing all your computer work which it got to a point, got to a 
place there where there was a lot of that. I mean there was, everything was controlled, overseen, so but 
then you would start your process of dispatch which would be getting your outgoing mail ready and 
package that you've taken in during the day. Well, and actually in the meantime is when your carrier 
would come in, if you had a route carrier. You had to have all of his stuff ready and then get him out the 
door. So it was--there was a long time in the middle of your day, as far as being really busy, but then it 
would get hectic in the afternoon. You'd get your mail and your deposit, back deposit out.

09:55  
 
EH: How did the work change from when you first started? 
 
JB: I'd say a lot of the procedure pretty much stayed the same except, what I alluded to earlier, the 
management--oversight management got probably a little more--I mean it was, kind of referred to as big 
brother watching over you. I mean it was, everything was, you posted how much mail you put up, you 
posted what time it got up, so they--and towards the end, I was actually was able to OIC a 18 level office 
shortly before I retired and they, it was like you knew, you went on and looked at a program, you knew 
how much mail was actually coming to you from the plant, that at the time was out of Clarksburg. You 
could, because of the processing machines that they ran the mail on, you knew how much mail was 
coming, how many packages were coming and based on that, you calculate, or they calculate for you how 
much time it should take you to process that mail and when you should be done. So management 
oversight (laughs). So I'd say that earlier on, it was like you, there's your mail, to me it always looked at 
it, they gave me the power and the authority, and they trusted me to do my job and that was part of getting 
into management that I really liked and wanted was that, I mean I worked in the Elkins Post Office and 
there was several employees there. So basically it was a lot, it was basically a group process where for me 
as an individual, you're the only one in there, so you're the one that's responsible whether it gets done or 
how it gets done. If it doesn't get done, you're also responsible. So I mean I liked that feeling of it. 
 
EH: So it became a computerized system? 
 
JB: Yes, a lot more than it did when I first started. 
 
12:21  
 
EH: Tell me about some of your customers and relationships you developed with customers over the 
years? 
 
JB: I could tell you a good story. I've often mentioned it to people when they've asked similar questions 
is, when I was in Cass. And Cass is a very remote little community, old logging town. Again, that was my 
first office. They have, back then the general delivery was still popular, especially in the smaller offices. I 
had a PO box section but there was a little short older lady who lived in one of the old row houses and I'm 
pretty sure, I'm pretty sure she cooked and heated by wood and coal. So I kinda referred to her as the coal 
lady. She would come in and again, the typical older lady with the hair pulled back, the long dress on, real 
sweet. But one day I remember she got her mail in General Delivery, which was at my lobby at the 
counter. I kept my General Delivery mail right there to my right and the phone was right there. Phone 
rang I picked it up and it was her. She said, wanted to know if she had any mail. I looked and I said yeah, 
there's a letter here for yeah. She said, oh well could you tell me where it's from? I said sure. So I pulled it 
out and looked at the return address and told her who it was, what it said, she goes "Oh! Well that's Aunt 
so and so" or something and I said okay. And she said, "I wonder if that's..." and I can't remember what 
she wondered that was and I said I don't know! I said, it's sealed up. "Oh. Well, could you open that up 
and read it to me?" I said Deed, I can't I'm not allowed. That's first class mail and we're not allowed to 
open mail like that. So I mean, and that's just, and small offices like that you get to know your customers. 
A lot of them [fan comes on] 
 
EH: Oh, heating system. (laughs) Okay. 
 
JB: A lot of them will come in on a daily basis. My office in Dailey, I can remember that when there was 
like 4 or 5 gentlemen would come in early in the morning knowing that the mail wasn't ready yet, but they 
AFC 2021/010: Rural Free Delivery: Mail Carriers in Central Appalachia / Emily Hilliard 
Interview with James “Jim” Bibey – 12/9/21

would come in, they'd come in there together and BS, you know? And what was interesting about it was 
like I'd be back in there in this really small office so whatever you, whatever conversation is going out in 
the lobby, you can hear it. But I'd be back there working the mail and getting it ready and they'd be out 
there chitchatting about different things that was going on. What was so interesting was they all had their 
spot in that little lobby and if somebody was late and didn't get there when they usually did, if somebody 
else was standing in that spot, there wasn't any question, they would just automatically move and they 
would slide right in. But it was interesting. It was fun times. 
 
EH: What about Emily Miller and Jesse Milnes? Emily put me in touch with you, so how did you become 
friends with them? 
 
JB: Emily was, first came into the office I remember and she--I can't remember whether how we, I think it 
was just a matter of coming in several times. If you see, once a regular customer comes in, I think they 
got--no, I think they had a PO box I believe. But anyway, they got to conversing with her and I think 
somehow she--I don't remember if she approached it or maybe I...I believe I saw something that came 
through the mail that made me wonder. Maybe it was something that was addressed to Sweetback Sisters 
at the time. But not that I don't read the mail (laughs) but you have to look for it to see where it goes and 
while you're boxing it, I mean it was, I probably approached it at one point in time and asking. So we got 
to talking about that and I remember, and Jesse came in with her one day and we got talking. It was 
always--I enjoyed when they would come in and we would just discuss and we got to talking about music. 
Her music, what she did, her traveling--at times she was still--they were still doing the traveling. Every 
once in a while, they would come in and she would say that they would be gone for a little while because 
they was headed overseas somewhere for a little tour. And then later I can remember one time they come 
in and they gave me one of her CDs and so then, a couple times I've been able, when they would be 
playing around here, I'd go watch them. And then we had a state convention--postmaster's convention-- 
that I was in charge of--convention chair at that time, of getting different things set up, so one evening 
entertainment I had asked her and Jesse if they would play for us, which they did a great job and were 
well received. 
 
EH: Nice. Are you a musician yourself? 
 
JB: I play. (laughs) I don't know that...I'm fortunate enough that for one season I played with a local band 
here and we was fortunate enough to play some decent venues for that experience. But then it's very time 
consuming and so yeah, I remember at one point I, for Augusta [Heritage Center, which offers workshops 
and classes in traditional music], when Augusta first started a friend of mine at the time was taking 
classes, but he was taking classes with, I can't remember--Phil Wiggins and... 
 
EH: uh-huh! 
 
JB: His buddy. 
 
EH: Cephas? I can't remember his first name, but [John] Cephas who was a blues guitar player? 
 
JB: Yeah, yeah. And he was doing the harmonica part of it, so he told me, he said, he did it one year and 
the second year they were back again. This was like earlier on in Augusta and he said you ought to take 
the guitar classes and I was like eh! I said I do, I mean sounds good, but I don't want to waste their time or 
mine, I said, he said because they had beginner, intermediate, and advanced classes. And I said I don't 
know where I would fit in, He said, well, I can ask him! I said, I'll see him. He said, well what do you 
want me to tell him you know? (laughs) I say, well tell him I know G, C, and D. So it was about 2 weeks 
later I saw my friend and he said, yeah I asked him. He said, and he even asked he said, well what does he 
AFC 2021/010: Rural Free Delivery: Mail Carriers in Central Appalachia / Emily Hilliard 
Interview with James “Jim” Bibey – 12/9/21

know? And he said to tell ya he knows G,C, and D. He said, the guy just looked at him and kind of rolled 
his eyes and said, "Well tell him there ain't nothing else!" (laughs) 
 
EH: (laughs) 
 
19:58  
 
JB: But no, I wouldn't consider myself, well I guess I am a musician. I've never formally taken lessons. I 
mean I picked up from other people. I enjoy it, it's good mental escape if you don't take it too seriously. 
 
EH: Right, right. Wondering--it's [the heater] actually really loud in the microphone. I'm wondering 
maybe if you sit over here, it's a little, I'm picking it up from the vent. 
 
JB: Or if we can move, if you want to move up into there, I don't think it's doing that up there. 
 
EH: Okay. 
 
END OF TAPE 
20:43  
 
00:00 
EH: Yeah, that's better. Okay. Why don't--what are some stories that you would hear from your 
coworkers and employees about their jobs and carrying the mail? 
 
JB: There was especially around in this area, during the wintertime, the rural route carriers could be a bit 
of a challenge because I can remember, well we had, I can't remember what year it was but storm Sandy 
or something I think it was called, came through and there for several days there was a lot of side roads 
that they had to go up and rural areas that, very challenging and there was, I can remember, this was at 
Valley Head, or Valley Bend, my carrier came in and was of course, by the time he got to my office was 
already running behind. And then there was one road that it actually, actually that day his assistant was 
carrying and she was very concerned about especially one area of getting up through. She had a 4-wheel 
drive so I, I think it was actually, it was on a weekend, occasionally that I would cover the weekend office 
for a time. So I remember going out with her and there was one section, literally, she was pushing snow 
with her front bumper and so I was just in the passenger side and for those, of course, all your mailboxes 
are on your passenger side. So most of the time if they didn't have a right-drive vehicle, they would have 
to actually literally sit in the middle of their console (laughs) so they could reach the boxes. So in that 
case I said, well I'll go with you and that way I can put the mail in the boxes for you, 'cause you're gonna 
have a hard enough time just steering or getting it through the snow. There was times when literally there 
must have been 10-12 inches of snow on top of the rural box (laughs) that you'd have to worry about not 
come cascading down into the mail, so it can be very challenging for them.  
 
I can tell you from carrying the mail, when times when I was still on foot carrying the mail, one of things 
you really hard to watch about was dogs, of course, and there was I think in the time, all the time I've 
carried, I think there was 3 times that I'd actually got nipped. Never serious but, and usually it was by a 
little smaller dogs because you wasn't paying attention to 'em. (laughs) Bigger dogs, I mean you knew. 
But I can remember there was, when I was carrying here in Elkins for the city carrier, I was a sub so I had 
to carry different routes whenever they were off or on their days off. And there was one route that the 
gentleman, I think maybe he was injured--the regular carrier and he would come in and case the mail and 
get it all ready and then I would take it out and then actually deliver it on foot. The first day we did that, I 
did that, when I was out walking around I said this dog, there was actually, there ended up being 3 little 
AFC 2021/010: Rural Free Delivery: Mail Carriers in Central Appalachia / Emily Hilliard 
Interview with James “Jim” Bibey – 12/9/21 
8 
 
dogs that started to follow me, I mean literally following me around. I'd deliver mail on a porch, come 
walking down the porch and there would be a dog. A little bit later halfway down the block there'd be 2 
dogs, and I remember at one time there was actually 3 dogs that was following me, I was like what are 
you guys, you know, what are you doing? I mean they weren't aggressive or anything, it was just like 
they'd be standing there looking at me. So when I came back in that evening or the next morning actually, 
I said something to the carrier, I said, "Oh" he said, "Did you feed them?" (laughs) I said, no I didn't feed 
them! He said, "Oh well I always take little dog biscuits out with me." I said they were waiting for that. 
And I was like oh! He said, so when you leave, before you leave, go back in my locker, there's a bag back 
in there. And I was like, alright, which we really wasn't supposed to do. So I got a few biscuits, put 'em in 
my satchel, and sure enough, there was that first little dog and I was like okay. So I threw him, he got his 
biscuit, off he goes, and the rest of 'em did the same (laughs) but there was one big black shepherd there 
that was on a chain and you come out of an alleyway and right away I mean he would just be, like he 
could just tear you up. So I always made sure I kinda circumvented around that one. So I remember 
asking him, I said, so what about that dog over on so and so street? "Yeah, yeah," he said. I feed him too. 
And I was like really? And he's like yeah! I was like, okay. (laughs) So that afternoon when I come out of 
that alley, there he was--that dog was just, a big old German Shepherd looking thing--just at the end of his 
chain, just like he would like to eat me up. I was like, well, maybe, maybe this is one of those...so I 
started walking towards him and he did, he shut up. But he was just staring at me. Had this look. So I got 
about I don't know 4 foot from him, I'm not getting any close than this. I had a little biscuit in my hand, I 
was like, okay, here buddy, here buddy, and kind of threw it over to the front of him, actually hit him 
right in the nose with it. He didn't even look down at the biscuit--he was still staring at me (laughs) like he 
was...later it was like, he was looking at me like, what in the world are you doing? (laughs) Are you 
crazy? So when I get back in I said buddy, I said, I told him what happened, he said, "Oh you didn't try to 
feed Satan did ya?" (laughs) I said the dog over on this street, whatever street, he was like "Yeah, oh 
yeah," he says, "Stay away from him!" 
 
EH: (laughs) So it was a different German Shepherd? 
 
JB: No, it was the same one.  
 
EH: Oh, okay. 
 
JB: I don't know whether he--initially I think he misunderstood which dog I was talking about. It was in 
the same area, evidently. But yeah, he says oh no, stay away from that dog, that thing is vicious! I said, 
yeah okay! (laughs) But yeah it's, other than, one thing I did learn about small offices though in 
communities, is what, and again like I mentioned earlier, you in a small office like that, even when you're 
in the back processing the mail, if somewhere is out there talking, there's no way, I mean you can hear 
'em. It's not like you're eavesdropping, but you can hear. So I learned real quick that what you hear out in 
the lobby of your post office stays in the lobby of your post office. I mean it's, there was a case where 
there was a situation where somebody else came in later and said, was so and so in here with so and so? I 
was like, uh, I'm not sure--they could have been, I heard someone out there, but I'm not sure, so (laughs). 
 
EH: Uh-huh. Yeah, someone else I interviewed said that, he's a rural carrier and he sort of avoids the post 
office because he says it just gets real gossipy. (laugh) 
 
JB: Yeah, I mean you're, well you are privy even the mail, I mean yeah, you can't help but see, well you're 
handling the mail, you're seeing the mail, packages. I mean I guess if you were real nosy (laughs) that's a 
good word, that yeah, you could learn, you could learn things or make assumptions of things from that. 
So yeah, it's best just to, here's your mail, it's--that's all I'm here for.

EH: Or if you were a writer you could write a great novel. 
 
JB: My wife at different times has said you should write all this stuff down and just keep a journal and 
make...I said, uh, no. It's (laughs) 
 
08:44  
 
EH: It's the postmaster's code to keep it quiet. (laughs) 
 
JB: The other thing we was, one thing they, the Postal Service would want you to do, when you took over 
an office is to become involved with the community and for a lot of, because the post office for small 
communities was a focal point. So I always tried, there was, with me it was, mostly of the offices 'til I got 
to Valley Bend, where I don't know my intention was to permanently stay there, but at least I was close 
back to my home to where it was, it wasn't a hassle to get there. And it was close enough it was only 8-10 
miles. So it wasn't really that I needed to move there to become part of the community. So there would be 
things like Homecoming, stuff like, I would always set up a stamp special stamp event type thing. 
Especially there was the Homestead community up there where they would have a yearly celebration for 
that, so we would always try to set up a special stamp event for that one. Schools, different times I would 
go into the school and do something there as the postmaster. One of the things I can remember, there was, 
this was part of my being an officer in our postmaster's organization in the national level, that there was a 
postmaster down in Virginia that had approached me at the time I was a area vice president for the 
organization, and we would, at our board meeting, he asked me to present to the board a program that he 
was starting down in oh, Stuart's Draft, I think it was, West Virginia [Virginia], that he would go into 
schools and show like grade school-level children how to address an envelope. And he would actually 
buy the envelopes, put the stamps on them out of his own pocket, show them and then encourage them to 
write a letter to whoever, to their parents or whatever or even to themselves, and to do it in cursive 
because that was a lost, becoming a lost art and I presented it to the board and was trying to get that 
presented to other areas, postmasters in other areas to do similar. And so yeah, we try to do stuff for the 
community, to be at events like that. 
 
11:46  
 
EH: Yeah, what do you think the importance of those post offices are for rural areas? 
 
JB: Very important. I know like then, there was a period of time when for cost-cutting measures and again 
our, the Postal Service was not funded by the government. Back in, I think it was the early 70s we became 
a quasi-governmental agency, which means we were still controlled by the government, regulated by it, 
but not funded by it. So we were expected to make a profit to keep in business. Well one of the troubles 
for that is, we were a postal service and not a postal business. So there was always a conflict there. So 
anyway, it came to the point where when the internet hit, it really knocked the revenue down. One line, 
like, first class mail used to be the money maker. Then when the internet hit, then it became 3rd class mail 
or business mail, catalogs, that kind of thing started picking it up. So then when a lot of that started going 
online, there was another knock on that. So they, the postal service needed to cut costs. Well, they come 
up with this idea that they were going to close and consolidate offices. Well when they did that, of course, 
understandably, say my office was slated on that list to be closed and consolidated with a local office 
somewhere close. Well right away the customers when they found out, they would started writing their 
congressional representatives, like woah, woah, we don't want to lose our office because this was, it was a 
focal point, which was understandable. They didn't want to lose that distinction, that recognition, even 
though they might have, if it was a physical building they would be losing, they didn't want to lose that 
zip code (laughs) was a recognition. Plus it's something, people growing up, they've had that address for

their whole lives! You know, for years, some of 'em forever. So yeah, it was, that's when, and it took a 
congressional action to actually close an office. So our postmaster general at the time, and I personally 
believe that this was all, they knew this was going to happen, I mean it was a no-brainer. I think this plan 
was already set in place, that okay, yes, I need your permission to close an office, but I can change the 
hours on it to whatever I feel that's needed. So the minute they changed like at the time my office was an 
8-hour office. As soon as they changed it to a 4-hour office, that eliminated my position as the postmaster. 
So there, it you know, to their benefit, I suppose, the Postal Service's benefit, they gave me 2 hours, or 2 
years to find something else. To find an upper level post office that was going to be staying open. Trouble 
with that was that it's kind of like, I always looked at it as musical chairs because there was very few 
chairs left and when that music got close to being stopped, a lot of those available offices that was going 
to stay open for 8 hours, again were few and far between and were pretty much already handpicked who 
was going to be slotted into those. So, yeah, I applied for 2 or 3 and you know, my, I was offered to go to 
Charleston to the plant to supervise, and at the time, of course I was married and still had 2 kids in school. 
And I was fortunate at the time to have the years and age to take a retirement. So I thanked them but said 
no thanks and I'll take the retirement. And then in July or June of 2015 I retired and stayed retired until 
no, I take that [back], in February of '15 I retired and in June of '15 I went to work for the County 
Courthouse. 
 
16:44  
 
EH: What impact did you see those closures or reduction of hours have on the community? 
 
JB: You unfortunately, you know, say like my office went down to 4 hours, so where, what hours do you 
stay open for 4 hours? You know, for a lot of people it's hard enough, at the time when I left, I think my 
office hours was from 8-5 with an hour break for lunch. But even at that, there was a lot of my customers 
that went to work before 8 o'clock. Left the community before that and then some of 'em didn't get back, I 
pushed them to get back to do business by 5 o'clock. So when they reduced it down to 4 hours, I'm not 
even sure what they went to, but I know the discussion was like 10, a straight 10-2. But there again, that's 
even worse for people, you know, to actually go do physical business at the post office, but then again, 
the push then from the Postal Service was this online. You could buy your stamps online, you could 
actually just drop your, get your postage online and drop it off in the drop-off box, so you, the brick and 
mortar Post Office business, they was pushing to get away from that. Or telling customers that they can 
go to one of these bigger offices that was open 8 hours a day. So yeah, it definitely impacted the people 
being able to come in and actually do their business face-to-face. 
 
EH: Did customers ever bring you gifts or when you were carrying the mail, leave things for you? 
 
JB: Yeah, that was the other thing too, I mean you (sighs) I can't remember exactly but you weren't 
allowed to, supposedly not allowed to accept I think it was maybe over a certain amount or something 
like that. But yeah, it was, I can remember in one office, it was the Valley Head office that whenever I, 
shortly after I took over that office, there was a lady that came in, older lady, real nice, and she comes in 
and started to wait on her. She had a package, a little box, and as soon as she laid it up on the counter, I 
could smell it. It was fresh bread! (laughs) It was just that distinguished, distinguishable smell and I was 
like, and actually the package still felt warm (laughs). I said something to her, I said is this bread? She's 
like yeah, she said, I just baked this, I mail it to her daughter. And I said I don't think--it's still not going 
to be warm when it gets there ma'am. I'm pretty sure of that (laughs). She laughed and said no, I said I 
know. She said, but she likes it, I like doing it for her. I said oh! And I kind of joked, I said, I just should 
tell you, I don't know whether the other postmaster that was here before mentioned this, I said, but we're 
pretty much required to test everything that goes through the mail (laughs). And she just grinned and she

said next time I'll make sure I bring you a sample. And I think it was the next time she came in, she 
actually mailed it out and handed me a loaf.  
 
EH: Nice. 
 
JB: So it was...I can remember during the season, people bringing ramps in to mail. That was always fun 
because they would bring it in first thing in the morning, my mail didn't go our dispatch until that 
afternoon, and so they was supposed to cold pack it, but half the time, it got to the point they did require 
that it had to be sent priority mail because you know, down the line as it was going through, they don't 
want it sitting somewhere for a long. It was pretty smelly stuff. 
 
20:54  
 
EH: Yeah, where were they sending ramps--to family members or selling them or what? 
 
JB: Yeah, out of state. Yeah.  
 
EH: Wow. Both, all of the above? 
 
JB: Yeah. It was quite interesting. I can remember earlier on in my career I farmed myself out or subbed 
myself out to work at the Buckhannon office, which then was a sect [sectional] center, which means the 
mail would come in in great big containers from all parts of the country and then you separated those out 
into smaller containers that actually went to different communities. We called it sectional center. So we 
started there at like 2 in the morning. Started separating the mail, getting it ready to go out to different 
branches. I can remember at one point in the time when you did as much as you could and then they 
would, someone would holler, "It's time to break down." So you would just start, people would just be 
scrambling trying to get the mail out to the dock to put them in separate vehicles to go to the different 
places. Well there was, there was people, they would, you could send poultry like little chicks and ducks. 
So if you had a little box of those, you didn't want to throw them down in one of these big containers in 
the bottom and stuff being piled on top of it, so you laid it down at the side so that, and waited, and made 
sure that it got up on top. Well, somebody had put one right below one of these containers. These 
containers, they called them ACPs and they have wheels on it of course, and they would put it right down 
there at the bottom and we were scrambling around trying to get things ready and just as I was walking by 
one of the containers, one of the guys had reached up to get ahold of the handle to start moving it and 
when I looked down I saw that they hadn't moved that--it was little chickens--and it just crushed the end 
of the box and I hollered and said, "Woah, hold it," and it just crushed enough, before I could get over 
there I seen this little head stick out (laughs) it was almost like, looking around going like...and he was 
like, "Come on!" (laughs) and next thing I know there's like 3 or 4 of those little chickens scrambling 
trying to, starting to run across the floor. So there were 3 or 4 of us running around trying to grab that and 
get 'em back in the box and fix the edge of the box back up. So yeah, it was, bees--my office in Valley 
Head, or Valley Bend, had a customer that would regularly get a load of bees coming in. So yeah, it was, 
some of it, there was chickens, rooster, I remember one time there was a rooster that came, fairly good 
sized rooster 'cause it started roostering (laughs) 
 
EH: Wow! 
 
23:52  
 
JB: Everybody was looking around like where's that coming from? 
 
AFC 2021/010: Rural Free Delivery: Mail Carriers in Central Appalachia / Emily Hilliard 
Interview with James “Jim” Bibey – 12/9/21 
12 
 
EH: Just in a big box? 
 
JB: Yeah. 
 
EH: And how would they package the bees? 
 
JB: The bees came in, I know, 'cause I remember the one guy up there at Valley Bend, actually there's 
always a queen in there with them and then several of the bees. I don't know whether they--they were 
alive, I mean you could see 'em moving around in the package. Because I remember he ended up--I don't 
know whether they got delayed somehow because there was a time frame that they were supposed to be 
able to deliver those in and for some reason I think they ended up coming, this one came in a few days 
late, so I don't know what happened for the delay. But the queen, I think the queen had died. And that 
pretty much I guess messes up the whole hive or whatever it was. It was interesting! (laughs) 
 
EH: (laughs) Wow. What kind of uniform did you wear and did it change over the years? 
 
25:02  
 
 
JB: The clerks, well the clerks and if you worked the window service area, there was a different uniform--
shirt and pants. The carriers I remember when we first started out, you get a uniform allowance so we 
had, it had certain--there was a different color scheme, slightly different color scheme and different shirt 
for that, and then pants. And then they would, got their shoes too. So it was a general allowance for that. 
But yeah, there was, there's very few ideal days to carry the mail, as a city carrier. Well, you know, rural 
carrier in a car but then you have to deal with the weather, road condition stuff, but for a city carrier 
walking the street, I mean it's--it was either too cold, too hot, or the mail was too heavy (laughs). And 
then you were on a time, you were expected to stay within a certain time frame to carry the mail, not 
matter, irregardless of the volume of the mail. So yeah, there was some days it would really hustle you to, 
because you had to prep the mail and again, when I was carrying the mail it was before the DPS or Direct 
Point Sequencing so they had to wait until the mail got separated and then you had to, you had your 
carrier case where it came in raw too, so you had to case all that into the delivery sequence, pull it all 
down, put it in your tray, get your packages ready, take it out to the dock, load it into your vehicle and 
hopefully load it how it's being delivered. I can remember, again, I was, I never had a regular route so to 
really get totally familiar with and comfortable with so I may not carry a city route for a month, two 
months, and then all of a sudden, I have to go in there and so then you constantly have changes, people 
moving, new people coming in and you get, so I of course, I'm always running late. You're late trying to 
get out of the office, so then you have to try to make up time once you're out there on the route. (Laughs) 
So I've got, oh gosh, I don't know how many trays of mail packages loaded on this, it's called a Nutting 
truck--big flat cart looking thing. So I pulled it out onto the dock and I'm like I said hurrying up, the 
Jeep's pulled up to the back of the dock. It was a windy day, I can remember, because I pulled it out to the 
dock and there were several other Nutting trucks already out there because pretty much all the other 
carriers already left. So I had to move a couple of those out of my way so I could move up to load my 
Jeep. Turned around to push one out of the way, when I turned around to walk back, there I see my 
Nutting truck (laughs) heading for the edge of the dock. And just as I saw it the front end was just tipping 
over. I reached over, ran over and grabbed the back of it and was trying to pull it, hold it and it was 
pulling me down so I had to let it go. There went my mail--scattered. Most of it come out of the trays and 
I was like oh no! Already running late. So some of the trays were still okay. I had to bundle it as best I 
could, take it out, so that was, it was one of those nightmare days where I can remember a time, literally, 
towards the end of my route, in order to try to make it back in the office on time, because there was a 
dispatch there too so if you picked up any mail out of it, you had to get it back in or you were delaying the 
AFC 2021/010: Rural Free Delivery: Mail Carriers in Central Appalachia / Emily Hilliard 
Interview with James “Jim” Bibey – 12/9/21 
13 
 
mail. I was always conscious about that. So literally running between deliveries, I mean between houses, 
just trying to make it back in there before the dispatch went out. 
 
EH: Wow. 
 
29:54  
 
JB: So yeah, it was, it could be--but there was some days where it was interesting. Your customers 
generally, I've never really had any, a few--you're always going to get a few that no matter how nice you 
try to be, and they may be having a bad day and so yeah, it's, it could be, it could be interesting! I had, I 
remember one lady, this was in Weston--it was one of the carrier part that I did and she lived just a little 
bit back off the sidewalk I mean you walked down the back end to her house, it offset a little bit. There 
was a front, full porch in the front of it. Nice old lady, older lady but she (laughs) she rubbed. But she 
always wanted to--I'm sure she lived by herself and she wanted to socialize with you. And you really 
don't, you don't really have time to stop and gab. I mean again you're on a short time frame thing and I 
mean you have time to say hi, how you doing, have a nice day type thing, but she'd want to stop and just 
talk for a while. But she would, the chew (laughs) would be running down her cheek and then in the hot 
summer day it was that small. Ugh. So I can remember going up on her...going on up on the sidewalk and 
in the summertime, she had a screen door, and the door would be open but the screen door shut and I'd 
ease up on the porch kinda (laughs) and open up her box there on the side of the wall there and put the 
mail in real quiet (laughs) and she'd hear me and I could hear her, I could hear her coming towards the 
door (laughs). Yeah, it was. Overall, like I say, I never had any major problems with any customers.  
 
EH: Is there a culture among postal workers, like jokes you tell to each other or a specific language or 
phrases that maybe only people who work at the post office would know? 
 
32:30  
 
JB: Ah, nothing I can think of right off. One thing that I always hated to hear was "going postal" and it 
became such a oh what would be the word, something associated with something negative or I mean, 
"You better watch out or that guy might go postal on you." Which I always thought that it was a shame 
that that connotation got put on as "going postal." But it could be, you know, actually, no I can't think of 
anything...I know in like say in Elkins, before DPS when we would go in we'd start early and the mail 
would come in raw and there would be like 5-6 stations set up, cases where for about, oh about an hour, 
hour and a half, you're just separating mail for the carriers, for the city carriers and rural route carriers and 
then you'd be on one side putting the mail in and they would walk on the back side and pull their mail out 
while you were doing it. So it was, there was times the camaraderie, I mean it'd be like 4 or 5 of us at one 
time doing that. And you're hustling but I can remember there was a lady that sit to my right. Generally 
you use the same cases all the time. Not that it mattered--it was all laid out the same, but that's where you 
just take your case. And she was to my right and (laughs) her ex-husband was to my left! Well they 
would, he especially would always, he would kind of like to turn the screw a little bit every once in a 
while, like if he could get her riled up, and it wasn't really hard to get her riled up. And here I am sitting 
right between them. So that could be interesting at times! 
 
EH: (laughs) 
 
JB: But he, she, and to her, she was on the end so there was a radio there that they had and so she liked 
country music and some of the other carriers, some of the other carriers that was on the other side of the 
room there would, the one guy liked to listen to the oldies station. So they made an agreement that they 
would switch off days. One day it'd be the oldies the next day she could listen to her country music, 
AFC 2021/010: Rural Free Delivery: Mail Carriers in Central Appalachia / Emily Hilliard 
Interview with James “Jim” Bibey – 12/9/21

especially on that morning part of it when everybody was working the mail. And I can remember, there 
was one day she had to get up to go up to the front at one point in time to get the certified mails and stuff 
ready, for the carriers. So she left, the carrier came up to get his, pull his mail out of the back, and he said, 
"Where's she at?" I said, "Well she had to go up front." "Oh well if she's gone I'm going to switch the 
channel back over." I said okay! So he switched it over. A little bit later, she came back. Sat down, she 
was like, wanted to know who switched the channel over to that music. And she said, "Did you do that." I 
said, "No, I didn't do it." And she said, "Oh I figure you did because you don't like that country music." I 
said, her name was Patty, I said, "No Patty, Patty, no! I like country music." She said, "You do not." I 
said, "Oh sure, hey Patty I was country before country was cool! When you're looking at country, you're 
looking at me!" And there was like 2 or 3 songs that I could think of (laughs) and I remember she looked 
at me and she made her little fist and she shook it and she said, "Oh, you! You see this?" She said, I 
turned around and I said, "Yeah, looks like a fist only smaller." (laughs) 
 
EH: (laughs) 
 
JB: So yeah, it was. I think I mentioned before maybe that I enjoyed the camaraderie of working in a 
group setting like that. It was interesting, it could be fun. And we all pretty much in the office here, in 
Elkins, we all got along. But my whole goal going into the Postal Office, my [unintelligible] goal was to 
finally get into management. And I can remember one of the guys I worked with in Elkins, after I got my 
office in Cass, which I mean it went from (laughs) Cass, in the off season, Cass was a touristy, I mean it 
had the train up there so during the summer when the train was going on, I had quite a bit of customers. A 
lot of customers coming in and out, tourists, very few local customers but in the wintertime or in the off 
season, it could be, I could go all day long and maybe only see a dozen people. So I remember a friend of 
mine that I worked with in the Elkins office, shortly after I had taken over the Cass office, I saw him and 
he asked me, he said, wondered how it was going and he said something about, he said yeah, I imagine 
there's a lot less stress, you know, there. (laughs) I said "Buddy, the only stress I have up there is self-
induced." (laughs) So yeah, that part of it was nice. 
 
38:21  
 
EH: Are you a fan of the Post Office, like ephemera and stamps and that sort of thing? 
 
JB: Having worked, you mean like collecting, that sort of stuff? 
 
EH: Yeah, and the history. 
 
JB: Yeah, having worked in the Post Office, like for stamp collecting, it was real easy for me, especially 
when they started coming out with the commemorative type stamps, especially the sheets of different 
stamps, of course it would have been real easy for me to be a collector, I mean obviously I had to pay for 
them too. And a lot of times in smaller offices when they would come out with a new commemorative 
stamp, you only got so many sheets of them. Actually automatically distributed to you. I mean you could 
order more if you needed, but a lot of times you didn't because you didn't have a whole lot of people that 
was collectors. So then I finally came, someone was telling me that they actually made a yearbook, a year 
that had all the stamps in it at one time with the nice little hardbound cover. So I started buying most of, 
you know, doing it that way. But yeah, there was--and then I can remember at one point in time--this was 
when the Looney Tunes stamps came out, a whole collection of them. Then the Post Office automatically 
started selling hats, ties, so then they would automatically send you that stuff too. I mean that, for smaller 
offices, that wasn't a real big seller. But I'm sure now, probably looking back on it, they might be collector 
items too. So I definitely have a few of those somewhere around. Because a lot of times I would buy them 
myself just so, to get them out of my office (laughs).

Interview with James “Jim” Bibey – 12/9/21

EH: Well is there anything else you'd like to share that we haven't talked about? 
 
40:44  
 
JB: Ah, like I say, I retired with 25 years in the Postal Service and I'm glad, I mean I was fortunate. It was 
a good career. I met a lot of people. And it's funny because one thing I can remember is that where I'm 
working now, somebody had brought up, mentioned somebody's name here in the local area and I said, oh 
you mean Liz over there at 1214 South Davis, or something, I can't remember...and they was like, "Yeah, 
you know them?" And I was like no! (laughs) Never met them! And then like I say, I have the, 5 offices 
that I, or more that I've been in, there's people that will bring, somebody's name will be brought up and I 
said yeah, I know them or they'll say something about them and in my mind I'm trying to think, let’s see, 
that was PO Box something, you know. But yeah, the downside to it I found out too is that people now, 
I'll meet 'em and they'll say something to me or come up and mention something to me and there will be 
that slight recognition but because of that, because of your position they know you, but I don't know 
them. I never knew them well enough other than their mail to really recognize or remember the name. So 
there's sometimes when I feel a little, kind of like embarrassed. You know, like, I guess it's right to say I 
don’t remember you, you know? (laughs) 
 
EH: Right, right. 
 
JB: Who are you? 
 
EH: (laughs) 
 
JB: Why are you talking to me? But yeah, I had a good career. I would have stayed with the Postal 
Service and would like to have stayed right there where I was at for a few more years, but like I say, 
unfortunately events just happened. And I, I'm concerned, I know the Postal Service, there has been 
mention about privatizing it several times, it's been discussed, and I think that would be disastrous for the 
service, for the service part of it. Because that universal mandate service, like, so you put, what now, I 
think 58 cents a stamp. You put a 58 cent stamp on a letter and I can mail that letter from here across the 
street. And unfortunately (laughs) for now it might take 3 days for it to get there! And that's just a 
biproduct of the fact of them closing and consolidating distribution plants. But my thought, the reason I 
brought that up is that same stamp for 58 cents can be mailed from here to Puerto Rico or Alaska. You 
privatize the Postal Service, that's going to have to change because it's gonna maybe cost you, you know 
58 cents to mail it across the street, but to get it to Alaska, that same mail might cost you 2 or 3 dollars. 
But then again, and it's just like our smaller post offices versus the larger post offices which bring in the 
better revenue. That whole thing was set up, my office, I don't know that any of the smaller offices I ever 
ran really made a profit. But we were there for that service. We relied, we were relying on the larger post 
offices to compensate for that revenue so that we would be able to give universal service. But I, my, I'm 
concerned that some kind of privatization will take place, will eventually happen with the postal service. 
How soon or to what extent that will go, I don't know, I mean even now, for years now, any new 
development that goes in, if at all possible, they make that a highway contract route instead of a rural 
route, because a rural route gets benefits through the Postal Service. So it [doesn't] benefits the Postal 
Service to make it a rural route, the only trouble with that is the regulation and oversight and control of 
that because you're contracting it out to somebody and then you kind of lose control over it, and who 
actually they get to handle your packages and your private mail. 
 
EH: Because they can subcontract?

retirement out of it. I just wasn't ready, I just wasn't totally ready to stop working. So, but I'm getting
