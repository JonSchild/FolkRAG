TWO WHITE HORSES STANDIN' IN LINE
Two white horses standin' in line, Goin' take me to my buryin' ground.
Did you ever hear that coffin sound? You know now that poor boy is in the ground.
Your heart stop beatin' an' your feet get cold, You can let me down with a golden chain.
It's one kind favor I ask of you; Be sure my grave be kept clean.
Did you ever hear the church bell tone? You know now the poor boy's dead an' gone.
Now two white horses standin' in line; Oh, take me to my buryin' ground.
Did you ever hear that coffin sound etc.
Sung by Smith Cason with guitar (Negro convict), Clemens state farm, Brazoria, Texas,
