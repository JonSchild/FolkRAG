 John A,  Lomax
 
Hand-written on stationery of the Office of the Comnmittee on
 
Affiliated Schools  (T.P.  Junkin,  John A.  Lomax)  Agricultural
 
and Mechanical College of Texas,  College Station,  Texas.
 No
 
date.  Paper margins crumbled away and some words had to be
 
guessed at.
 
I am to talk to you this evening on the Stewardship of
 
Influence.  A steward,  as  I shall use the term,  is one who
 
takes care of something that has been put  into his keeping by
 
another.  Then "stewardship" means simply the office of a
 
steward,  or to put  it  in the language of my first definition,
 
the word stewardship means the act of taking proper care of
 
what  is entrusted to us.  Websters gives one definition of
 
"influence" that  fits exactly the use to which I wish to put
 
the word.  He says  influence is power quietly exerted.  Power
 
is a strong word.  It  is a high tribute to say of one that he
 
is a man of power.  It  is a greater tribute,  as we see,  to say
 
of one that he posses  influence,  for that means that he
 
possesses power and that also he exerts that power quietly.  A
 
gentleman has been defined as a man who is quiet.  An
 
influential man then,  is a gentleman who exercises,  without
 
ostentation or noisiness,  power.  To become such a man is
 
surely not an unworthy ambition.  Indeed,  in my opinion,  the
 
desire to wield influence  is one of the strongest and one of
 
the most universal motives of the human heart.
 
In the being of every person,  there live two forces,  the
 
force that prompts to evil and the force that prompts to
 
good.  This  statement  is as close to a theological one as any
 
I shall make,  for it  is not my purpose to deliver a sermon;
 
but my own experience,  and I believe also yours,  supports the
 
truth of the doctrine of the good and evil impulses that
 
dwell in a man's nature,  that take up their abode with him
 
whether he wills or no,  that  fight  for the mastery of his
 
life,  that give him struggle after struggle,  until at last
 
one or the other proves the stronger.  St.  Paul had this
 
struggle  in mind when he wrote,  "When I would do good,  evil
 
is present with me." Poets have  sung of this  combat,  and
 
painters and sculptors have left us  in permanent  form their
 
conception of the war that goes on in the consciousness of
 
every individual.  I have in mind especially a piece of work
 
from the hands of a famous American sculptor which expresses
 
in beautiful marble the battle scene that is repeated over
 
and over again in our lives.  Two strong young athletes,  equal
 
in physical grace and strength,  are engaged in a terrific
 
struggle  for mastery,  the one of the other.  The result of the
 
combat  is  left  in utter doubt,  while the inscription on the
 
marble tablet below the struggling figures contains the words
 
of St.  Paul,  which I have  just quoted.  "When  I would do good,
 
evil  is present with me."
 
As  I have  said before,  I believe  in the real existence
 
of these two forces,  and I believe,  furthermore,  that one of
 
the forces ultimately is the conqueror of every individual.
 
It may seem unfair that the controlling powers have willed
 
that the fiercest battles must be fought by us when we are
 
least prepared for them.  For it  is to the youth when all his
 
sensibilities are most keen,  when every faculty of his mind
 
and heart  is most open to impressions,  when all his passions
 
are most active and unreliable,  when he lacks the experience
 
and forethought that  come only with years -
-
 it is  just  such
 
a one who must  furnish the theatre as well be the arbiter of
 
momentous decisions.  This,  however,  is the lawt of life.  It
 
is the young who suffer most  severely through temptation,  and
 
it  is a truth that  should be squarely faced and bravely met.
 
Shall we not be thankful that the forces that impel him to
 
goodness are strong and that they grow stronger through
 
successive generations? And is it not a further occasion for
 
thankfulness that,  as we grow older,  if we continually resist
 
the impulse to evil,  our powers of resistance become
 
practically impregnable?  If such an asseretion did not
 
negative  (?)  a specific statement  in the Bible,  I should like
 
to say that  I believe there are many men in the world who
 
live day by day,  year after year,  without committing sin.
 
The man who consistently yields to the promptings of
 
evil we shall say exercises an evil influence.  He has mis-
used a power that has been given to him.  His  stewardship is
 
in the realm of evil,  in furthering ruin and destruction.  For
 
him as  far as this talk goes,  I have no concern.  The man who
 
yields to the good in his nature,  on the contrary,  until it
 
becomes the motive of his  life,  has,  it  seems to me,  acted
 
most wisely.  He has  come into possession of influence  just
 
because he has  shown himself a successful fighter.  In other
 
words,  he possesses power.  How shall he most wisely use that
 
power? This question must  carry a strong appeal to every
 
thoughtful young man.  I possess power that might be used
 
efficiently  (
 )
, if my life attains the highest
 
usefulness.
 
The Bible gives a specific answer to the question of how
 
a man shall use his  influence with his  fellow men when it
 
says,  "Whosoever would be chief among you,  let him be the
 
servant." You will remember that the doctrine of service is
 
at the heart of the teaching of the wise President of
 
Harvard.  He says that every man was put  into this world to
 
serve and the sole reason for man's education is that it  is
 
to make him a more efficient  servant.  A popular misconception
 
of education is that  it  is  intended to free us from a life of
 
service.  On the other hand,  it  should only equip us for wider
 
fields of service and furnish us with the knowledge and
 
wisdom to render more efficient  service to a larger number of
 
those who need service.  An education,  we must remember,  is
 
simply power given to us  for use,  and if we are good stewards
 
we must exercise the  influence that education brings with us,
 
to service mankind.
 
Not  only is a life of service  laid upon us as the chief
 
responsibility of education,  but  it  seems to me also the
 
chief activity of a religious  (person) .
 Christ  summed up half
 
of the Commanmdents when he called on us to love our
 
neighbors as ourselves.  Surely we cannot  love without at the
 
same time  (giving)  service.
 
Men often made the mistake of waiting for opportunities
 
for service to mankind that seem big and of looming
 
importance.  Such opportunities come to but  few.  But each of
 
us,  every day,  may render help and comfort if we are guided
 
by a heart that  is not  shut to tenderness to those who need
 
the counsel and sympathy of a friendly nature.  Surely a cadet
 
on this college has a great opportunity to serve his fellows,
 
especially the men of the entering class,  who in many
 
instances are away from home for the first time and who often
 
grow lonely and heartsick in a life so new and strange to
 
them.  Such services any cadet of generous  impulse,  I feel
 
sure,  is always glad to render.  But  it  seems to me that work
 
of this character belongs particularly to the college Young
 
Mens'  Christian Association.  If religion means anything at
 
all,  it certainly carries with  (it)  the idea of intelligent
 
and tender service to our fellow men.  Render such service
 
here and now,  during your college days,  and thus carry out
 
the office of a good steward -
-
 one who exercises power and
 
who wields that power nodestly,  quietly,  intelligently.
 
If you once grant the possible existence of two opposing
 
forces  in the nature of man,  pulling in opposite directions,
 
one to a life of evil,  the other to a life of beneficence,
 
then it may be possible that  in some instances the two forces
 
practically equalize each other.  We thus have the negative
 
character,  a man whose life stands neither for evil nor for
 
good,  who lacks the positiveness either to do right or to do
 
wrong.  Such a man again has been the theme for philosophers
 
and poets who hold him up to ridicule and scorn.  Perhaps,  in
 
this connection,  some of you will recall Kipling's story of
 
Tomlinson.  Tomlinson died and,  his  spirit appearing before
 
St.  Peter,  could not  recall any one good deed he had done for
 
man  "or ever he come to die." St.  Peter would not receive him
 
and Tomlinson wended his way to the gates of hell where the
 
Devil also greeted him with an enquiry,  asking him of the
 
"harm he did to the sons of man or ever he came to die".  The
 
wretched Tomlinson was  forced to confess that his  life had
 
been so colorless that he had neither done one deed of
 
positive harm.  So the Devil in disgust bade him:
 
"Go back to the earth with lip unsealed -
-
 go back with
 
an open eye,
 
And carry my word to the sons of men,  as ever ye come
 
to die,
 
That the sins they do by two and two,  they must pay for
 
one by one."
 
Whether or not there be a grain of truth in the story,
 
you all will agree that the most admirable characters are
 
those who are positive,  that  show their colors,  that live
 
their lives  in the open,  and with manly courage.  The negative
 
character described by Kipling is the  servant who hid his one
 
talent  for fear he would lose it;  the man who has the proper
 
rergard for the stewardship of his  influence,  on the other
 
hand,  lays out his talents and is ready to exhibit ripened
 
fruit on the coming of the Master of the Vineyard.
 
I now have probably said enough,  but you will forgive an
 
additional word from one who is a bit older than you.  I
 
believe in youth,  and I love and honor all the manifestations
 
of a healthy-hearted young man.

the tender age of seventeen life had dropped over his slender shoulders
 
a robe of sombre responsibilities. His driving he also took seriously, 00

THE OLD WOMAiT AND THE LITTLE PIG
 
rhere was an S
IO].d
h
 Woman Who Had a Little Pig" is a very
 
nice lullaby.  Where it came from to our family is lost in the mists
 
of time.  John, 3
re says he heard it on a Boy Scout hike.
 I think I
 
brought it home from one of our Sunday afternoon walks.  Even though
 
it tells a sad story, really its a jolly song.  You can hum in
 
between the verses, its nice to pat your foot to, and the general
 
effect is enjoyed by young children.
 
The fact that "the general effect is enjoyed by young
 
children" is the main reason of survival for all our American animal
 
songs, of which there are a tremendous number.  Some are remnants
 
from English tradition;
 others were early Negro songs;  many were
 
probably made up as jigs and lullabies by pioneer parents for the
 
amusement of the young-tins.
 
American animal son s run the gamut of the common fish,
 
flesh and fowl -
-
 even insects are represented.  Most of the songs,
 
like "The Old Woman and the Little Pig" are nonsensical;  many of
 
them are a collection of scattered verses like
 
Raccoon has a bushy tail
 
Possum's tail is bare,
 
Rabbit's got no tail at all
 
But a little bunch of hairJ
 
Though most of the songs concern woods animals -
-
 rabbits,
 
coons, jaybirds and the like, barnyard animals are not neglected.
 
I know three songs about pigs which, considering his unromantic
 
nature and looks, is a pretty good average2

DONEY GAL
 
One day as I passed by the building in San Antonio where
 
the indigent musicians of that city and vicinity were putting in
 
eight hours a day in return for a Federal hand out, I heard the un-
mistakable sound of hillbilly music.  Their leader turned out to be
 
a black-haired woman.  She was friendly, busy on her job of keeping
 
twenty or more other hillbillies busy.  I was to call at her home
 
that night with my recording machine and hear her songs.  She played
 
a guitar skillfully.
 
She was half-Indian from Western Oklahoma, deserted by her
 
husband, and she supported five children on fifty-four dollars a
 
month from Washington.  That night she sang a store of songs now
 
deposited in the Archive of American Polk Song in the Library of
 
Congress.  Among her songs -
 the song that touched my heart -
 a song
 
about the rain which does sometimes fall on the plains -
 was the story
 
of a cowboy who turns his back on the comforts of home, the companion-
ship of loved ones, and heads North on the cattle trail--
I'm bound to follow the longhorn steer
 
Until my race is run.
 
Said Mrs. Louise Henson:
 "One time my uncle came to see us folks on
 
our ranch in Oklahoma.  When he got ready to leave the rain was pour-
lug down;  but the weather never stopped him.  We watched him ride
 
over the hill headed for the round up, singing his favorite song about
 
his pony, "Doney Gal".  He was a good singer, too.
 None of us ever
 
saw him again."
 
Probably the word '
tDoney" cor
nea through the Spanish.  Anyhow
 
the cowboy was calling his pony his sweetheart, his most precious
 
possession.  Did not his life depend on the sure feet and clear eyes
 
of his pony, running through the storm and darkness helping the cowboy
 
flank a herd of stampeding steers?
 
I
L
  
-
 
-2-
Only once before had I heard the expression "Doney Gal".
 
In a low Negro dive in notorious Beale Street, Memphis, Tennessee, I
 
was trying to get from a Negro guitarist some of the folk-song creations
 
of the Negro race, when drunkenly he pointed to his woman companion
 
who carried his extra "picks" and other musical gear,  "She's my doney.
 
Ain't you my doney?" he said to her.  "I sure am", said the woman.
 
Introductory:
 
We're alone, Doney Gal, in the wind and hail,
 
Got to drive these dogies down the trail.
 
Stanzas:
 
We'll ride the range from sun to sun,
 
For a cowboy's work is never done;
 
He's up and
 
gone at the break of day,
 
Drivin' the dogies on their weary way.
 
It's rain or shine, sleet or snow,
 
Me and my Doney Gal are on the go,
 
Yes, rain or shine, sleet or snow,
 
Me and my Doney Gal are bound to go.
 
A cowboy's life is a weary thing,
 
For it's rope and brand and ride and sing;
 
Yes, day or night in the rain or hail,
 
He'll stay with his dogies out on the trail.
 
Rain or shine, sleet or snow,
 
Me and my Doney Gal are on the go;
 
We travel down that lonesome trail
 
Where a man and his horse seldom ever fail.
 
We whoop at the sun and yell through the hail,
 
But we drive the poor dogies down the trail;
 
And we'll laugh at the storms, the sleet and snow,
 
Then we reach the little town of San Antonio.
