Dr. Harold Spivacke Chief, Division of Music Library of Congress Washington, D. C.
Dear Dr. Spivacke:
A report on Professor Morris's records was forwarded to Mr. Chas Seegar in the
Washington office of the Music Project. Professor Morris is quite willing to donate the
originals to the Library of Congress provided duplicates are available to him for study
at State headquarters of the Florida Music and Writers' Projects. These two projects
have agreed that the duplicates which you will give us shall be placed in the files of the
Florida Music Project, to be available to both projects and to Professor Morris, who is our
consultant. I trust this arrangement is agreeable to you.
Sincerely yours, Carita Doggett Corse Carita Doggett Corse State Supervisor, Statewide
