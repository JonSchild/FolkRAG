He was horn about the year of '49; 
His head was full of scars from stopping railroad 
ears, 
lie was ring- boned, spavined, deaf and blind; 
Tie could kick a

And send you where Bob Ingersoll belongs; 
He died at half past four, he's gone to that beauti-

Empty is the stable, Davy's gone. 
His hoof was like a 
slingshot, he could raise you 
through the roof, 
he'd e,otne into the house and kick you out of bed; 
His feet was full of bunions, he could eat a

BROOKLYN BRIDGE. 
Copyright Secured, 1882. 
Sung with great success by LESTER & W ILLIAAM 
— 
Things in the city are uncertain, 
3 
Queer changes take place every day; 
Politicians are sighing and crying, 
And prize fighters they have a 
sway. 
There's a 
question I've never heard answered,' 
Although asked by most every one, 
By the question I 
mean the conundrum, 
When will the new Brooklyn Bridge be done. 
When the river dries up and stops flowing, 
When aldermen won't take a 
bribe, 
When Kelly runs for the president, 
And poor Mary Walker has died, 
When Anna Dickinson writes a 
new drama, 
And lets Fanny Davenport play it for fun, 
When Bernhardt goes looney and marries Pat 
Rooney 
Why, the new Brooklyn Bridge will be done. 
When tenement houses won't tumble, 
And Lorillard his horses won't run, 
When Tahnage preaches for pastime, 
Arid New York linsn't a 
bum, 
When Conklin and Maine love each other, 
And gamblers deal faro for fun, 
When Bob Ingersoll tells how he prospered in 
Why, the new Brooklyn Bridge will be done. 
THE STABLE ISN'T EMPTY, 
DAVY SMILED. 
Written by D. F. MORTON, and sung with great SIICee8S by LEST= 
& W ILLIAMS. 
Davy, our old donkey, is a 
ten-day bum, 
He navigates upon three wooden legs; 
lie takes a 
Chinese laundry for a 
restaurant, 
He'll waltz right in and order ham and eggs. 
He can bray in Latin, Irish, French and Greek, 
In Thompson Street he ate a 
colored child; 
We thought he'd hydrophobia chewing nigger wool, 
But the stable isn't empty. Davy- smiled. 
CHORUS. 
Davy is a 
la la, his tail he used to bang, 
His good looks drove the female donkies wild, 
He got struck by Jersey lightning, that kills at forty 
yards, 
Yet the stable isn't empty. Davy smiled. 
On a 
keg of powder Davy smoked a 
butt., 
lie wanted in this wicked world to raise; 
Then he let a 
spark fall, then he rose sky-high, 
And ate hay above the clouds for forty days; 
When he went on rackets he would look for fight. 
He'd kick the City Hall down when riled, 
lie wrestled collar and elbow with the- &tat River 
Bridge, 
Yet the :;table isn't empty, Davy smiled. 
CHORns. 
The skin on this here Donkey is nailed with carpet 
tacks, 
A 
fly upon his rear end made him wild, 
He kicked both his legs off trying to knock it off, 
Yet the stable isn't empty, Davy smiled. 
Now Pm going to sing a 
little song, the tune you've 
heard before, 
'Tain't Grimes' cellar door, or love in days of yore; 
You've young fellows slipped upon a lean banana 
core. 
But here is something new; 
I'm in love with Cranky Ann, and I asked her for 
her hand, 
And she gave it to me right across the ear.

to some beer,

Oh, the pawnshop! the pawnshop! 
The place to pawn diamond rings. 
On every street you'll surely meet 
Some one pawning their things. 
Mrs. Murphy tried to pawn her child

Owney Geoghegan tried to pawn himself, 
And so did. Lawrence Barrett; 
Will you lend me a

And give you a

dreamt of a 
beautiful time 
Wlieit the world shall happy be;

When the elephants and hyenas 
Shall blossom on every tree; 
When tamarinds and potatoes 
Shall cease their dreadful roar; 
When turnip trees shall blossom 
In the garden forevermore.

dreampt of a 
great republic 
When the people shall all go West. 
Sow plums and reap tomatoes 
In the land they love the best; 
When pig iron and molasses 
Shall bloom on every hill, 
And chickens low in the barnyard. 
White gooseberries toil at the mill. 
I'm weary of seeing the cabbage 
Handle the rake and the hoe; 
I'm weary of watching and waiting 
For the grasshopperbush to grow; 
I 
long for the time when spinach 
Shall cope with bread and milk; 
When hens shall lay potatoes, 
And horses spin raw silk. 
Oh! sweet were the vanished hours 
When_ I 
wandered down the glen, 
And wreathed my brow with tomatoes, 
Or plucked the ripened hen; 
When the donkey twined up the trellis. 
And the cuctimber chirped in the grass: 
And the sweet potato whistled 
To its maid on the mountain pass. 
But gone are the days of childhood,. 
And manhood's dreams are mine; 
Yet I 
long for by- gone hours, 
As 'I 
sit 'neath this Turkish vine. 
Oh! WITO the your blossoms about me, 
And soothe my aching breast; 
While gooseberry plaintively warbles 
And lulls me into rest.

GRANDPA'S DONKEY. 
A.m.--" Violet FromIllot.`ter's Grave. 
- Sang with great success by LEsTF.a. & Wmt„,..444s. 
-Grandpa had a 
donkey, his maiden name was Pete, 
The masher of the stables he had no nose or feet, 
lie would get drunk on oysters, was cross-eyed and 
too fresh, 
ills bones weighed forty ounces, and you could not 
see his flesh. 
.As a 
kicker, none slicker, he won the cake and cheese, 
He'd wear out any sidewalk and eat up house and trees, 
He was trained in the hind legs, he could juggle 
stale beer kegs, 
Grandpa's heart is broke since Peter died. 
CHORUS. 
Peter kicked the bucket, for he had the yellow 
jaundice, 
They made mincemeat of his ears, tail and hide, 
To remove him they were not able, 
so 'they put 
crape upon the stable, 
Grandpa's heart is broke since Peter died. 
He was born in the south of Italy, his parents they 
were Jews, 
He stood seventeen feet high in stockings without 
shoes; 
With Roscoe he went to Congress, and if he had 
acted smart, 
He might have been conductor on a 
dizzy railway cart 
But he was a bummer, a loafer, a turncoat and a 
tramp, 
His sickness was caused from drinking out of a 
Chinese lamp; 
He ate up fourteen hens, cleaned out sixty-eight pig 
pens, 
Grandpa's heart is broke since Peter died. 
CHORUS. 
Snowballs on his tombstone to keep his memory fresh, 
This quadruped I 
don't think ever lied, 
He is buried in our back yard, his headstone is a 
postal card, 
So 
grandpa's heart is broken since Peter died. 
OH , CLARENCE. 
Azu..—' Oh. Fred, Tell Them to Stop." 
Sung with great success by LESTER & W ILLIAMS. 
A young fellow name Clarence had a 
nice little girl, 
She was chambermaid in a 
drug store, 
She -had forty-live lingers upon her left hand, 
And her age it was just ninety-four, 
Tier hair it was false, and so were her bangs, 
And her face was the shape of a 
cracker, 
And when he would kiss hth she'd always exclaim, 
Clarence, throw away that chew of tobacco. 
Cnonus. 
Oh, Clarence, you are too fresh, 
Shut. up, Mary Jane, you're a 
liar, 
I'll darken your eye, if you go out on the sly, 
And then make you walk the slack wire. 
She loved Clarence dearly, yes, as dear as her life-
But Clarence, of course, loved another, 
When she heard of this she committed :suicide 
And Clarence then married her mother, 
Re tickles her under the chin every night 
And calls her his darlings, his duck, 
This sweet little daisy, she'd near set you crazy, 
in a 
hot& she arives it big truck. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, Clarence, kiss me. again, 
Squeeze me and 
never tire. 
Lay your head on my breast, then pull down your 
- vest, 
And draw your chair nearer the fire, 
A COMICAL MAN. 
Words by CHARLES GLIDDEN. Music by ClIARLESS HAMA& 
Now give me your attention for a 
couple of years, 
And I'll crack you a 
comical weeze.; 
About a 
young man who was found in a 
tank, 
With nickle-plated pads on his knees. 
For flirting with a 
corpse one day, he was collared, 
They brought in a 
case of big Annie, 
As he sat in the cooler, he tried to fool her, 
As he played on his iron peannie. 
CHORUS. 
Plinkie plunk, plinkie plunk, 
That was the tune, 
Be played it from August 
Till the middle of June. 
Last night he escaped, 
Through a 
lager beer saloon; 
But on Sarah Bernhardt's stocking, 
He'll soon reach the moon. 
Now I'll finish my song of this hemale young maxi; 
His coat was bound round with cheese binding; 
His pants they were tin with the fussie side in; 
So the dogs couldn't catch on behind him. 
His vest was red leather, bound round with a 
feather, 
For buttons he wore cranberry tarts, 
As he walked along the streets with his celluloid feet, 
He'd buist all the young ladies hearts. 
CHORUS. 
Spider's legs, ham and eggs, 
Skip the gutter, let her go; 
Who pulled the string? 
It's creeping so slow. 
'Twas his size took the prize; 
So we thought it our duty, 
To ship him to Forepaugh, 
For the ten thousand beady.

Now my pocket's empty, friends are gone. 
But alas! for friendship such as money buys, 
For they are naught but seekers after wealth; 
They'd not lend a 
dollar t'ease my wants and sighs, 
They who often drank my wine and health. 
They who used my carriage now refuse to speak, 
To them I'm no longer known, 
Why should I 
disparage, why should I 
grow weak? 
I'm a 
man, tho' friends and wealth are gone. 
Money it is mighty, etc. 
At my home are children crying now for bread, 
They who've had the cream of all the land, 
Weeping with their mother, and from want. near dead 
She who had so much at her command. 
Work they all refuse me, help they will not give, 
And I 
feel all hope has flown, 
Badly Pate cloth use me, all, why should I 
live? 
Now my pocket's empty, friends are gone. 
Money it is mighty, eto. 
AMERICA'S ROYAL . BALL 
Composed and sang by P. J. DowNST. 
I'd like to tell you all and one, 
A 
ball came off with lots of fun, 
I 
very nearly lost a 
lung, 
The music was entrancing. 
Hancock and English went there to choke, 
McLoughlin and Kelly for loosing the vote, 
From Ciartieki's mouth there came a 
look, 
When Kelly gave English a 
hand and foot., 
Hancock came up to strike a 
blow, 
McLoughlin proved his overthrow, 
Arthur marched up to the onslaught. 
Backed by a 
tribe of men he brought, 
Garfield stepped out into his place, 
And brought the bosses face to face, 
John Kelly cries, Garfield, I 
said grace, 
And then commenced the dancing, 
America's own Ulysses Grant, 
From looking on began to pant, 
They want a 
king by all that's damp, 
For glory I 
am dying. 
Beecher then began to cheer, 
And Talmage soused him in the ear, 
The Devil was there with a 
flea in his skull, 
.Dancing with Bob Ingersoll:

When Hayes stepped up and bounced him out; 
Kearney cried out, "Me bowl is filled, 
When all the Chineemen are killed;" 
"Amen to that," says Fagan the Jew, 
"They'd make the best of Irish stew;" 
When Tanner cried out cold water would do, 
The eggs began a

George Washington Childs was sent In quest, 
Of Francis Train, invited guest; 
Ben Butler cried, "May I 
be blessed, 
The dead beads they are splendid." 
George found Train among a 
bunch, 
Of bar-room. nobles eating lunch; 
George says, "Train, come have some tripe,* 
And out of that there came a 
fight; 
Grant dived in amongst the jars, 
And filled his pocD eta with cigars; 
For the money Beecher made a 
grab, 
But Talmage made another dab; 
"Enough of that," says Fagan the Jew, 
When in his eyes an oyster flew; 
Then in the street the crowd was threw, 
The Royal Ball was ended.

A PARODY. 
Written by JAS. RICHMOND, for JOSEPH SPARKS of the SPARK:i BROS. 
There is a 
great many lies that are known to be false, 
While chest protectors are twelve cents a 
dozen; 
Don't talk about Grant because he is Irish, 
And California is Beechr:T's first cousin. 
If peanuts was seventeen dollars an ounce, 
We'd feed Italians on gravel stone cake, 
Don't believe that Queen Victoria gets live million a 
minute, 
And Ireland is starving on porter-house steak. 
CHORUS.

say is a 
notorious lie,

A 
LEAN banana, decayed to the core, 
E'er since I 
slipped on thy peel I've been so sore, 
On my back I 
lingered just where I 
fell, 
The sweet words I 
uttered would ne'er do to tell, 
If I 
could have caught then the dizzy looking gawk, 
Who threw that banana peel out on the walk, 
It made me see stars that I 
neer saw before, 
A 
lean banana I'll love thee no more. 
CHORUS. 
Liglatly I'll tread on the sidewalk evermore, 
A. lean banana rotten to the core; 
I 
slipped orally peel, I'll be careful evermore, 
A 
lean banana from some foreign shore. 
A 
lean banana you've caused many a 
roar, 
I 
slipped on thy peel and you turned me o'er and o'er, 
And young girls have blushed so when thrown off their 
pegs, 
S!ipping on a 
banana and showing their dear legs, 
Numerous are the pedestrains that you have caused to 
fall, 
Great big and little, lean, lank and tall, 
The seats of fat men's pants you've busted and you'y 
tore, 
A lean banana, how they have swore. 
CHOR us. 
Wa*tchful I 
am from the time I 
leave my door, 
A 
lean banana I've heard of you before, 
E'er since I 
slipped on thy peel I've been so sore, 
A 
lean banana from some Dutch grocery store.

THE BLESSED BABY SHOW. 
Written and sung with immense success by SAM DEvitar..) 
Have you been to the buby show 
To see the darling babies, oh ? 
Old maids and bachelors ought to go, 
To se:, nose blessed babies. 
To hear the little cherubs squall 
Dig and fight, and scratch, and bawl, 
They'd secretly wish they ownad them all 
Those blessed little babies. 
Fat, and lean, and big, and small, 
How they love to kick and squall; 
Everybody likes to go 
To see the blessed baby show. 
If a 
baby raises a 
hullabaloo, 
You'll hear its mammy say to you; 
Its toothy wootsies are truntnin through, 
Don't ky, you blessed baby. 
Some babies act as though on springs, 
Some yell until they bust their strings, 
Some chew on their toes and rubber rings. 
it pleases those blessed babies.

BRANNIGAN'S PUP, 
Bang by JANES O'NEIL and JOHN CONROY with great sue-eess. 
Now old Mickey L..annigaa had a 
ball-pup, 
He was bred of rale elegant stock; 
For seventeen hours a 
battle he fought, 
He did, by my soul, by the clack. 
His tail was a 
neat little bit of a 
stump, 
Bow-legged, and twO crooked eyes; 
One look at his ugly-looking mug was enough, 
He was the divil himself, iu disguise. 
CHORUS. 
Bow-ow-ow, what a 
pup, to be sure, 
For fighting he'd never give up; 
There never was known such a wonderful dog 
As Mickey Brannigan's pup. 
He tore the tail off Maloney's best coat, 
Ate the bustle of Mary Ann Flynn; 
And run between young Kitty Mulligan's legs, 
Now wasn't that truly a 
sin? 
He caught up the Dutch shoemaker's dog, 
And shook him around like a 
rat; 
He murdered Tim Finnegan's beautiful goat, 
Ate the tale off McManus's cat. 
Bow-ow-ow, eto. 
An Italian came round with an organ one day, 
And a 
monkey tied fast to a 
string; 
And when the pup saw them, he yowled with delight, 
And made a 
most wonderful spring. 
He upset monkey, grinder, and all, 
And bursted the organ inside; 
And, be jabers, he tried to swallow the monk, 
But he choked on his tail, and he died. 
Bow-ow-ow, etc.

ME BIG AQUARIUM. 
Written composed and sung by SAM 
DEVERL 
I 
stopped at the big aquarium, 
Not very long ago; 
To see the bass and suckers, 
And to hear the white whale blow. 
A 
skate and a 
flounder making love, 
And they shook .each others fins; 
And a 
crab with a 
sunshade over his bead, 
Come along with a 
pair of twins. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, the big sea lion he howled and growled, 
And the seal beat time with the drum; 
And the whale he swallowed a 
ton of eels, 
At the big aquarium. 
I 
had my gal along with me, 
She's purty, but she's dark ; 
But when she laughed and opened her mouth, 
I 
thought she'd swallow the shark. 
The lobster smiled and sucked his thumb, 
And laid as still as death ; 
When the turtle winked his eye at Sal, 
It nearly took her breath. 
Oh, the big sea lion, etc-. 
The music played and the sturgeon danced, 
But the porpoise cleared the track; 
The eel he tied himself in a 
knot, 
And the crab walked on his back. 
The trout and the catfish danced a 
reel. 
And the sea lion let a 
roar; 
When the whale got up and blowed his ese, 
My gal, Sal, bounced out the door.

COUGH , 
JOHN, 
COUGH, 
AND MAKE THE BABY. 
LAUGH. 
As sang by NED BARRY, with great success. 
You see that I'm a 
married man, at least I 
think you ought, 
By eighteen months of wedded bliss some trouble I've beeu 
taught, 
I'm father of a 
bouncing boy who's always wide awake ; 
And I've to cough to keep it quiet until my jaws they ache. 
SPOKEN. — Yes, I'm the happy parent of a 
crying doll 
I've 
bought rattles, India rubber tooth- rings, sugar-sticks, and every-
thing else I 
could think of, but it is impossible to keep the child 
quiet, except in one manner ; and that is why my wife is al-
ways crying out--
toit us. 
Cough, John, cough, John, cough, and make the baby laugh, 
Cough, John, cough, John, and make the baby laugh, 
Why don't you keep it still ? it's crying makes me ill, 
Cough, cough, cough John, and make the baby laugh. 
Some call the baby pretty pet, awl ask us out to tea, 
Where I've to act the part of nurse, and dance it on my knee ; 
My wife she sits down with the rest to have a 
good blow out, 
But as the blessed infant squalls, to me she's sure to shout— 
Cough, John, etc. 
I 
never get a 
wink of sleep, for when in bed at night, 
The baby's sure to waken up, and cry out with affright ; 
My wife commands ire with one word, and then begins to snore 
While I've to hug that wretched child about the chamber floor 
• 
SPOKEN .—Fancy me roused from my virtuous couch at mid-
night by a 
dig in the ribs, and told to carry that wretched baby 
about in my night-shirt, singing, " hush ' a- bye- baby,'' etc. 
ft's 
don't you hear, John ; wake up, John ; get up, John, and 
Cough, John, eta. 
• 
My trouble never has an end, it's morning, night, and noon ; 
If I 
continue coughing so, I'll have a 
coffin soon ; 
I 
hear the baby coughing now, and as my throat is sore ; 
If you, my friends, will cough with me, you'll quiet it I'm sure. 
SPOKEN.—I 
feel as though I 
had the whooping cough. and 
could swallow a 
box of cough lozenges. 
So just keep the baby 
quiet, we'll 
Cough, boys, etc.

I'm bothered, yes, I'm bothered, 
Completely perplexed; 
I'm the father of a 
little boy, 
I'm not happy, but I'm vexed. 
I 
have ninety-nine relations, 
And they nearly drive me wild, 
Both one and all, both great and small, 
They want to name tne child. 
Cnonus. 
My wife she wants him Michael, her sister wants him 
Matt, 
Her brother wants him Charlie, whilst her aunty 
wants him Pat. 
Whilst her mother wants him Shamus, and my father 
waqts him Paul, 
I 
do declEe, I 
don't know what I'll name the boy at all 
'Twas only here this morning, 
My brother came from Troy, 
He swore by this, he swore by that, 
That he would name the boy. 
8ays my wife's brother Darby, 
He be hanged if that would do, 
And they jumped together on the floor, 
And had a 
bold set-to. 
My wife she said it'll be Michael, etc 
Next Sunday is the christening, 
And I'll tell you by the way, 
I'll have none of their connMngs, 
I'm hound to have my say. 
They may call him this, and call him that, 
I 
don't give that for their call, 
I'm bound to call him Dennis, 
Or he'll have no name at all. 
My wife she may want him Michael, etc.

MOINAHAN'S MULE, 
Written by MIRE BRADLEY, 
Sung by FLORA Moons. 
YOU'VE heard of my donkey, 
And horse 1suppose; 
But I. have another 
That none of ye knows. 
He's a 
mule short and thin, 
And he has a 
short tail, 
You can count. all his bones 
While he's eating his meat 
The way to my stable 
Is just one foot wide; 
lie can run all the way up 
And ne'er touch his side; 
He's too short for my cart, 
And as black as a 
moke, 
take him apart some day 
Just for a 
joke. 
(Repeat last four ?
fttes.). 
I 
think that. I'll kill him, 
And go get him stuffed, 
For he is no good, 
For he's lived long enough ; 
I'll take out his teeth 
To give to may girl, 
I'll cut off his tail 
And preserve it in oil. 
I'll take out his eyes, 
They'll make good billiard balls, 
I'll have him in a 
glass ease 
At Hibernia Hall. 
If Bergh interferes 
And comes off, 
I'll tell him my mule 
Died of the whooping cough.

THE MAN THAT STOLE THE COUNTRY. 
Written by FRANK E. 
McNisll expressly fur Mum-tiv & MACK. 
W e'll tell you of a 
terrible thief, 
Who for stealing things could not be beat, 
he'd even steal the grub he'd eat, 
The man that stole the country. 
In 
his sleep he'd dream of what he'd done, 
And when he'd awake, the son of ,a 
gun, 
he'd get up and go out and steal for fun, 
The man that stole the country. 
Caonus. 
-He stole a 
horse, he stole a 
cow, 
A stack of hay and a 
cast-iron plow. 
He 
swiped a 
dog most dead with old age, 
A 
whole row of footlights off from the stage. 
L ast night he came in this very place, 
And took the nose right elf a 
man's face. 
All kinds of fish, from a 
whale to a 
perch, 
Even the steeple from Trinity Church. 
A 
pile of timber, a 
liberty pole, 
Stewart's body he must have stole. 
He 
was bread of a 
family of very bad rank, 
He 
stole all the bonds in the Manhattan Bank. 
The Elevated Read he would have got 
If 
it hadn't been riveted to the spot. 
He'd steal the tongue out of your mouth 
W hile you would be talking; 
He 
stole the shoes off O'Leary 
W hile he was a 
walking. 
He 
stole a 
mule that was dying with cramps, 
Then went out W est and colored all tramps; 
Into a 
shop and sneaked out the boss, 
Ose-r to Philadelphia and nipped Charlie Ross. 
In Gilmore's. Garden he colored the track, 
He 
even tried to steal Murphy and M ack, 
And still he wasn't satisfied— 
The luau that stole the country.

THE MAN THAT STOLE THE COUNTRY, 
Continued. 
To 
Blackwell's Island he was sent, 
Aud life-time given to repent 
For things he'd done with bad intent. 
The man that stole the country. 
But the villain he was very bold, 
And prison walls could not him bold. 
And he's around again, so -we're told—. 
The man that stole the country. 
CHORUS. 
A 
pait of boots, a 
tub and a 
saw, 
The wonderful man with with the cast-iron jaw, 
A 
full brass band, and a 
new piano, 
The ballot boxes in Louisiana. 
President Hayes' ulster and beaver, 
Went to New Orleans and took the fever; 
Came to New York to steal Hell Gate; 
And he'd had it, too, if he hadn't been late. 
Fe stole a 
whole gang that were out on a 
lark, 
If he hadn't been watched he'd had Central Park, 
Stole a 
street car, the driver and all. 
Then went up and took Tammany Hall. 
Took r. cop right oft from his beat, 
Stole all the bears that -were in Wall Street. 
To steal the City Hall he often did wish; 
He took the false teeth away from MaNish. 
He stole a 
house they bad just finished building, 
Took Bessie Turner from Theodore Tilton. 
Into a 
sellool and nipped the teacher, 
He'd had Elizabeth, too, if it wasn't for Beecher. 
Stole some young folks that were playing backgamn.inh 
W ent to the London and stole Murphy and Shannon, 
And still he was not satisfied— 
The man that stole thre country.

MARY'S GONE WITH A COON. 
Cepyright, 1880, by GEO. D.
-NEWHALL & co. 
Dar's heaps of trouble on de old man's mind

My Mary Ann's run away wid a

And he's black, he's black as he can be. 
But I 
wouldn't care if he was only yellow, 
But he's black all o'er; he's porter in a 
store, 
And my heart it is tore, when I 
think the matter o'est 
Dat de child dat I 
bore, should think of me no IMAM 
Dan to run away wid a 
great black coon. 
CHORUS. 
Mary's gone wid a

Mary's gone wid a

Heaps of trouble on de old man's auk 
Since Mary's gone wid a 
coon. 
Oh! I 
never thought, when I 
raised dat child, 
Of de trouble she would be to me; 
She had everything dat her heart could wish, 
She was raised in the lap of luxury; 
And I 
never once for a 
moment suspected 
But dat she'd reflected, before she selected 
A. man more respected, more highly connected, 
Less darkly compleeted, and not have dejected, 
Dis old man's mind with troublc like dis. 
- 
Mary's gone, et. 
Now all you people who have children to raise, 
Take warning at my fate; 
Watch over dein carefully or else you'll f.hd, 
Like me, dat you have been too late.,

Dey're always after beaux, and wbaring good sliothai 
And going to shows, and no one knows,

MY OLD WOOLEN BREECHES. 
Written by JAS. P. 
GLENN, of Phila. 
There they hang in the corner, on a peg in the wall, 
My old woolen breeches, suspenders an' all; 
With naught to disturb 'em 'cept the roaches or bugs, 
But when I 
used to wear'em how I'd put on "lugs." 
How well I 
remember the summer nights gone by, 
When we stood by the tree-box, my sweetheart an' I; 
We'd give each other " taffy," my head she 'ud 
"

"In my old woolen breeches," she said, " I 
alwisys 
looked well." 
CHORUS 
One night, while retiring, they did rip, rip, rip, 
They busted up the side from the knee to the hip; 
After many years of service bright scenes they recall, 
My old " Camden Cooler" now hangs on the wall. 
If those breeches could but speak, oh, the tales it ' ud

How he " rassled" with his mother-in-law, so bravely

It could tell of bright days an' of a " dark" one

The day when " that " mother-in-law stood longside

She said: " Jimmy, you must shake 'em, 'cause they

Sung with enthusiastic applause nightly by the ever popular

Never empty cradle, though you're in my care,

Nursey pursey came one wintEr morn;

Crowded was the cradle—twins were born.

Twins are in the cradle, making twenty-four, 
Sons and daughters making me forlorn, 
go to the " angel" and have two penn'orth more 
Crowded is the cradle—twins are born. 
In her shady bed-room nurse is always found 
All night long the fat old humbug sleeps, 
she's round the corner standing glasses round, 
Drinking till she gin and water weeps; 
While the little twinses squalling more and more, 
Swell until they burst their little bed; 
And one little angel wallops on the floor, 
Tumbles from the cradle on his head. 
CHORUS. 
Twins are in the cradle making twenty-four, 
In my side they are a 
dreadful thorn, 
They don't sing of angels, I 
am blessed sure, 
Crowded '
is the cradle—twins are born. -

THE NEVER EMPTY CRADLE— TWINS IS BORN, 
(Concluded.) 
Hang the blessed cradle, nearly every night, 
Just as I 
get into my first snore; 
Twinses with the quinses N
-vake me in a 
fright. 
Keep me up till half-past three or four. 
Mother sleeps in comfort, says she knows that dal 
Sees her little chicks don't come to hurt. 
But, poor meh the father, I 
get cold and mad. 
In my cradle costume— that's a 
shirt. 
CHORUS. 
Never empty cradle, baby's in galore, 
Bachelors against it I 
would warn 
If you wed your angel you'll find it a 
bore, 
When you rock the cradle in the morn. 
Who would be a 
father when he knows the price, 
Sees how soon the punishment begins? 
Half a 
dozen times I've been a 
father twice— 
Half a 
doken pair of healthy•twins. 
All my pieces spent and all my peace is gone, 
All my friends now look on me with scorn, 
Say there is no reason in such goings on, 
Worn out is the cradle—twins are born. 
CHORUS. 
Twins are in the cradle, both are in a 
roar, 
Aroarer early morning to adorn, 
They make pretty angels, never sure before 
Were such little cusses ever born.

O'REILLY'S BILLY ( OAP. 
(A 
RECITATION .) 
O'Reilly owned a 
billy goat 
And a 
great buck goat was he, 
He would buck almost anything 
That he'd happen for to see. 
And if at night he'd roam the streets 
And a 
drunken man he'd meet, 
He'd buck hint till he.  was sick and tired, 
And then his clothes he'd eat— 
O'Reilly's billy goat. 
He knew every policeman on the beat, 
And he knew if him they found 
That he'd spend a 
short vacation 
Down here in the city pound. 
He ate Mrs. Mulligan's underclothes 
That was hanging on the line, 
Shure he bucked a 
Dutchman in the belly, 
And knocked him out of time— 
O'Reilly's billy goat. 
But every goat must have his day, 
And this goat's day did come— 
He met a 
butclier's dog one day, 
And the do.- for him did run. 
He chased the goat through the streets, 
Shure the dog for him was too smart, 
lie chased him till he lost his wind 
And he died of a 
brol= en heart— 
O'Reilly's billy goat. 
;Now, down here in a 
vacant lot 
in a 
corner quite alone, 
There we buried o'Reilly's goat, 
And over hint raised it stone; 
And perchance you'd pass that way, 
You'll ! Ind these \vords on it are wrote: 
Sacrad to tlw memory of 
O'Reilly's . 
great buck goat.

Written and sung by SAM DEVER& 
'Twas a 
stormy, cloudless night, 
The moon was shining bright, 
A 
night that lovers love the best of all ; 
But the scene was quickly marked, 
By a 
noise in our back yard, 
When I 
heard a 
great big torn cat loudly call— 
CHORUS. 
Oh, Maria! Oh Maria! 
Maria, your Thomas with love is on fire ; 
Oh, Maria! Oh, Maria! 
That's what I 
heard the whole blessed night. 
At love they both did play, 
In their own peculiar way, 
With now and then a 
most unearthly yell ; 
Their courtship was immense, 
'Till from over another fence, 
Another great big torn cat loud did bawl— 
roitus. 
On, Maria ! 
Oh, Maria! 
If you shake your Thomas, he'll surely evict. 
Oh, Maria! Oh, Maria! 
That's what I 
heard the whole blessed niglit. 
These torn cats humped their backs, 
And made some wild attacks, 
Each other's hides they terribly did mawl ; 
While they were fighting hard, 
A Thomas in the next back yard, 
just took Maria's ear and loud did bawl— 
Crionus. 
Oh, Maria! Oh, Maria! 
Come over in our yard sand sit by the fire, 
Oh, Maria ! Oh, Oh, Maria! 
That's what I 
heard that whole blessed night.

The many happy evenings, 
I 
spent when but a 
lad, 
On Paddy Duffy's lumber cart, 
'Quite safe away from dad; 
It stood down on the corner, 
Near the old lamplight 
You should see the congregation there 
On every summer's night. 
There was Tommy Dobson, 
Now a 
senator, 
Billy Flynn, Johnny Glynn, 
They were killed in war. 
All merry, boyish comrades, 
Recollections bring, 
Seated then in Duffy's cart, 
On summer nights to sing. 
Chorus of " Twinkling Star:!" 
We'd gather in the evening, 
All honest working boys, 
And sit on Paddy Duffy's cart, 
No one marred our joys; 
All seated in the moonlight, 
Laughing mid its rays, 
I 
love to talk of old New York, 
And my boyish days. 
There was Henry Gleason, 
Now a 
millionaire, 
Curly Bob, Whitey Rob, 
They're living on the air. 
All merry, boyish, eta, 
Chorus of " Little Fraud." 
A merry little maiden, 
Nobby, neat and coy, 
smiling up at Duffy's cart 
Upon her sweetheart boy, 
It made a 
jealous feeling, 
A quiet bit of chaff, 
All in play it died away, 
And ended in a 
laugh. 
There was Larry Thompson, 
He was a 
chum of mine; 
Sandy Green and Lemy Freon 
Died in forty-nine.

grocery store planted on every corner, 
You can get potatoes, onions, sugar, and what'ki

If you want to buy flour, teas, or resins, 
They'll never kick the buyer from the door. 
CHORUS. 
Then gather around the Tombs of a 
Sunday mort-

And see the prisoners' heads feel awful sore; 
The keeper eyeing like a 
watch dog, 
He'll never chase the prisoner out of the door. 
In a 
tenement house on any Fourteenth Ward street, 
Where you see a 
three-cent liquor store, 
If you kick against paying for the alcohol, 
They'd smash your nose and chase you from the 
door. 
Written and sung by SA

Oh, I'm waiting for your sire, 
Baby mine—baby mine ; 
But he's such an awful liar, 
Baby mine—baby mine. 
He was coming at nine o'clock, 
But he's up on the Dutchman's block, 
Getting full of Rye and Rock, 
Baby mine—baby mine, 
And his ulster 513 in the hock, 
Baby mine. 
Oh, your dad's a 
terrible boozer, 
Baby mine—baby mine, 
He's a 
whiskey-soaked old s.nOozer, 
Baby mine—baby mine. 
If he comes home drunk, I 
swear 
I'll dissect his jaw with care, 
And demolish him with a 
chair, 
Baby mine—baby mine; 
With a 
brick I'll part his hai; 
Baby mine.

SALLIE HORNER. 
il'opyright, 1880, by H. G. HoLLENBERO. 
There's a 
little girl that chant 3 
The world as well as me, 
With her eyes of blue, so sweot and true, 
And heart so free; 
Many hours, and the flowers, 
Do I 
pass with her; 
Sallie Horner, round the corner, 
Little one so dear. 
CLTORUS. 
Now I 
wonder, as I 
ponder, 
If she's true to me? 
If I'm any, of the :many— 
Will she constant be? 
None completer, none is sweetu 
In this world of ours; 
Sallie Homer, round the cornea., 
In her home of flowers. 
you'll discover how to love her 
If you only try; 
You'll be given gleams of heaven 
if you catch her eye; 
Like the stars that gleam and gliatcn 
In the azure sky, 
When she speaks the angels listen 
As they as her by. 
Now I 
wonder, .A6, 
She is very sly and merry 
In her rogueish way; 
t 
adore her more and mon) 
In all my love-lit days; 
Always suing, fondly wooing 
For her heart's divine; 
Sallie Horner, round the corner, 
Oh, she must be mine.

PARODY ON " PUT ME IN MY LITTLE BED.', 
Words by JERRY COHEN. 
Sung by BILLY W EST. 
Oh, Birdie, I 
am exceedingly fatigued at this moment, 
I 
do not care for an exhibition of your vocal abilities, 
All day you've displayed them to satisfactory advan-
tage, 
So put your head beneath its usual feathered pro' 
tector. 
I'm sleepy too, the approach of slumber is apparent, 
And, Birdie, when my habitual devotions have been 
disposed of, 
1 
want to prostrate my person in the arms of Mor-
pheus, 
go put me in that soothing harbor designated as my 
virtuous couch. 
CHORUS. 
Come affectionate feminine relative approach, 
Kiss me with compliments of the hour, 
I 
my evening devotion have uttered, 
Pm infinitely fatigued and fain would seek repose, 
So put me in that resting place designated by the 
appellation of my little bed. 
Oh, Birdie, repeat the ejaculations of our maternal 
protector, 
When she to the abode of eternal bliss was sum-
moned, 
She told me always to assume a 
disposition of amia-
bility, 
end never, never stray from the paths of virtue and 
prudence. 
Ill ne'er forget the day her spirit departed from its 
mortal casket, 
She placed her digits upon my devoted cranium, 
And whispered softly, retain my obedient offspring, 
And then I 
received information to the effect that she 
had shuffled off this mortal coil. 
Come affectionate, etc.
