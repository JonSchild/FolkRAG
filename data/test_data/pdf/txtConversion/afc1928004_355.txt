REMEMBER YOU HAVE CHILDREN OF 
YOUR OWN 
An original song by FRANK LEWIS. 
Sung at the Olympic 
Theatre, N. Y. 
Music published by E. H. HAnnisG, 229 Bower:. 
Price 35 
cents. 
Copyright secured. 
In your path through life each day, you will meet upon the 
way, 
Fellow mortals upon whom this world doth frown, 
Who, from poverty or crime, have fallen in their time, 
Or by circumstances crushed and striken down; 
Young men with blighted names, who once had noble aims. 
Young girls with shame and sorrow on their brow, 
Whom a 
kindly word might save, from a dark, dishonored 
grave, 
While a 
cruel one would drive to madness now. 
They were once to some one dear, so don't pass them with a 
sneer, 
But speak a 
kindly word in cheering tone; 
You know not what's in store, for the loved ones you adore, 
Remember you have children of your own, 
The shop girls on the street, with as much respect should meet, 
As the millionaire who in his carriage rolls, 
And the honest laboring man, with his strong and horny hand, 
They too have hearts and feelings—yes, and souls; 
Their family is as dear to them as any here, 
Though their clothes may be all ragged, torn and old, 
Dejected and forlorn, yet, still their hearts are warm, 
Though they lack the rich man's cheerful home and gold. 
They are all to .onie one dear, so don't pass them with a 
jeer, 
But speak it gentle word in soothing tone; 
You know not what's in store, for those whom you adore, 
Remember you have children of your own. 
Don't despise the wretched poor, whom perhaps grim want 
may lure, 
To steal the bread their starving children crave, 
Be not the one to blame, you yourself would do the same, 
With starvation at your door you'd dare the grave; 
And the wretched drunkard, too, who perhaps was once like 
you, 
Respected and beloved by one and all, 
Who no doubt through care and strife, or some sorrow of their 
life. 
Have fallen, lint not quite beyond recall. 
And the poor outcast forlorn, don't pass them by with scorn, 
But speak unto them in a 
gentle tone ; 
Perhaps they're not to blame for their lives of sin and shame, 
Remember you have children of your own. 
A true illustration of life, written expressly for FRANK LEwt: 
by Bonny NEWCOMB, America's Character Artist. 
When I 
was of age my father he left 
To me quite a 
snug little stun ; 
Ile says—" Now, my boy, good sense please employ, 
And remember you've reached twenty-one." 
My friends when they heard of what had occurred, 
how they hastened to borrow or beg ; 
For I 
dew a 
high kite, and they said, when in sight— 
" 
He's the goose with the golden egg." 
To my utmost surprise I 
attracted all eyes, 
And people inquired my name, 
Who a 
few months before, pronounced me a 
bore. 
And of my dress and my features made game. 
They'd laugh when I'd joke, with me dine, drink or smoke, 
To my face they were dumb as a 
keg; 
But when I'd turn my back. how they'd laugh and 
they'd_ 
clack, 
At the goose with the golden egg. 
The,girls all so fair, admired my hair, 
l'et was auburn—before it was red: 
They spoke of my style, drooped their eyes when T'd 
And mamas marked me tit to be wed. 
Their daughters they sighed, and some their hair dyed, 
I 
was loved by Jane, Martha and Meg; 
My presents they took,. and they all tried to hook— 
The poor goose with the golden egg. 
But a 
day came at last, I'd been living too fast, 
Pun in debt and my money all flown; 
WI iere'er I 
would call, they'd let me wait in the ball, 
And the message I'd get—" Not at home." 
They'd giggle and jeer, where'er I 
appeared, 
Pass me by with a 
nod or a 
sneer; 
For the goose it was dead, arid the egg turned to lead, 
had bought my experience dear. 
Now my subject of rhyme may just be in time. 
For the world I 
don't care it peg : 
But what T 
would say- 1 
was once in my day, 
A 
poit- goose with a 
golden egg.

GIVE A 
THOUGHT TO THE HONEST WORK-
INGMAN. 
An original song sung by FRANK LEwis, at the Grand Central 
Theatre, Philadelphia. 
This is a 
world of luck and chance, of losses and of gain, 
Some lives are filled with pleasure, while others naught but pain, 
If yours is filled with comfort enjoy it while you can, 
But sometimes try and give a 
thought to the honest workingman, 
There's many a 
mighty millionaire who now sleeps in his grave. 
Who never gave a 
single dime the laboring man to save. 
Of such as these to sing about ' tis not my aim or plan, 
For I'll sing of men who gave a 
thought to the honest working-
man. 
There is one, who though in wealth he rolled, whose charity 
was sure, 
And the clink of his bright yellow gold was music to the poor, 
And many a 
cheerless hearthstone by his kindness was made 
bright 
In noble deeds of charity that never saw the light. 
By some beloved, by some adored, by others fawned around, 
He turned not to the right or left but nobly stood his ground, 
In every mrghty enterprise each project or each plan, 
George Peabody always gave a 
thought to the honest working-
man. 
There was a 
man who rose to fame and fortune, swift and sure, 
Whose name will be remembered in our hearts forevermore; 
Though wealth rolled in his coffers for years on every hand, 
He shared it with the hungry and the poor of this bright land. 
He was a 
Nature's nobleman if ever there was one, 
A 
tender, loving husband, a 
kind and gentle son; 
His bright face we will see no more, forget him now who can ? 
Abe Lincoln always gave a 
thought to the honest workingman 
THE MINSTREL'S DREAM. 
An original song, as sung by FRANK LEWIS with immense 
success. 
One eve while sitting in my chair before my fire so bright, 
Its rays dispelled the midnight gloom, and lightened up the 
night, 
My thoughts reverted to the past, and brought before my gaze, 
The shadowed forms of minstrels great, the kings of by-gone 
days; 
I 
saw the people laugh and cry, as alternately they gave— 
The merry pull, the mirthful joke, the ballad sweet and grave, 
They formed a 
quaint procession, as they passed before my 
sight, 
The minstrels of our former days, thus conjured from the night. 
I 
saw George Christy shake the bones, sweet innsic from them 
drag, 
And how the audience it would roar, as he told each merry gag, 
Saw " Daddy" Rice in ecsutcy, those legs of his to throw 
The father of the minstrels—he who danced the first " Jim 
Crow ;" 
Heard Mulligan, with towering form, pathetic ballads sing, 
When Long John opened once his mouth, ' twa.s down the house 
he'd bring., 
Stevie Rogers gave his excelsior clog, the greatest ever seen, 
And other well-known faces came to till my minstrel's dream. 
Noise Seymour showed his giant form, and passed me by and 
smiled, 
A 
friend to every one in need, the minstrel's favorite child, 
How oft l'A-0 heard his merry laugh, as he made the night pass 
o'er, 
Give out the joke which ever sot the audience in a 
roar; 
He scarcely disappeared when came the minstrel king and 
The glory of the boys in black—the merfn, laughing Dan, 
As Bryant passed me by, his face with radiance seemed to 
beam, 
lie cast a 
brilliant halo upon my minstrel's dream. 
Young Jerry, of the Bryants, too, with bones and tamborine, 
Recounted every great success in minstrelsy he'd seen, 
Billy Manning, of Chicago fame, then passed me swiftly by. 
And Unswortit gave his great stump speech, in which he the 
world defied; 
Jimmy Bradley danced his unequalled jig, familiar t.o us all, 
Billy Pastor sang his comic songs, and was many times recalled, 
Epli Horn, the last bright face I 
saw, he threw a 
radiant gleant 
Upon the spirits who had gone to fill my minstrel's dream. 
DESCRIPTIVE SONG, 
Sung originally by FRANK LEwis, at the Holliday Street 
Theatre, Baltimore, Md. 
In New York they had a 
carnival which did not come off well. 
Like man v 
things in that great town, 
King Rex " was but a 
" 
sell;" 
Mr. Barnum will ten thousand give, if he can run across 
And find the mysterr of the age—the long-lost Chancy Ross. 
They say that three bells you must have if 
iquor you will sell, 
The law- of the Excise reads you must keep a 
large hotel: 
You dare not to a 
laborer a 
glass of lager give. 
In fact a 
workingman has now no earthly chance to live. 
You know there's been a 
mighty strike throughout our own 
dear land, 
And brothers fought with brothers brave, when as foemen they 
did stand; 
'Twas not against the soldiers the strikers stood at bay, 
But the railroad kings who grind them down to seventy cents 
a 
day. 
We ask for peace and friendship, and hope none will destroy 
The flag that now protects our land— both woman, man and 
boy: 
We also ask that rich men all a 
fair day's pay will give, 
For it's only right a 
workingman should have a 
chance to live. 
Our great Beecher he a 
sermon preached, a 
few short years 
ago, 
That men should guns to Kansas take, to shoot down every 
foe; 
thought it a 
strange doctrine (scarcely Christian, by the way,) 
That lie should think the laboring man. who gets but a 
dollar a 
day, 
Should live on bread and water, with Ins wife and children 
dear, 
While he himself does drink his wine, and thousands gets a 
year; 
Let him try bread and water once, and a 
new sermon he will 
give, 
Tie 11 say it's right a 
workingman should have a 
chance to live.

HITS ON THE TIMES, 
As sung by FRANK LEWIS, at Irving Hall. N. Y. 
Here's my latest batch of telegrams that's come o'er land and 
sea, 
From the snow-clad hills of Greenland to the fields of Tennes-
see; 
There's some very fnnny incidents transpiring every day, 
And which I'll tell you in my song, but don't you give them 
away. 
We've had some funny lawsuits in this, our glorious town, 
But the strangest one that I have heard, and the latest going 
'round ; 
Count Joannes he has lately sued our Sothern for damage done, 
Because, as a 
crushed tragedian, he the Count's great fame has 
won. 
Our ex- President, now in Europe, is in that land across the sea, 
He treads upon a 
foreign shore, so gallant and so free; 
Whether Russia or old Turkey in their struggle may be right, 
Our General Grant, the soldier bold, can show them how to 
fight. 
Some did not like him as a President, but this much we can 
say— 
That he did his duty nobly in the thickest of the fray ; 
God bless him on his journey, for he is a 
warrior brave, 
And well he fought in days gone by, our country's flag to save. 
We're having strange scenes in our courts, a 
case occurred last 
week, 
Where two fathers tried, at the same time, a 
little girl to seek; 
Now I know there's many children who do nc,t their father 
know, 
But one to have two at a 
time is a 
curious thing to show. 
Still I'm glad she's not lost to the stage, but give her genius 
scope, 
She'll become, like Clara Morris, the people's pride and hope; 
I'm sure that in the future Mabel Leonard will be seen— 
The brilliant actress of her day, upon the stage a 
queen. 
11 
ALWAYS HELP THE POOR, 
Written by CHARLES BURKE, for FRANK LEWIS, and sung by 
him with marked success. 
Oh, what a 
pleasure 'tis to have a 
man extend the hand 
Of friendship to you, when perhaps a 
stranger in his land; 
But greater still to know and feel on him you can depend, 
Who proves by acts, and not mere words, the value of a 
friend. 
Then never turn your back upon a 
man because he's down, 
But always lend a 
helping hand with smiles and not with 
frowns; 
Let him but think that happiness is yet for him in store, 
And he will bless the giver, boys, who always helps the poor. 
There's the poor boys, one and all, they've many noble traits, 
The millionaire might well be proud to have within his gates; 
The poorest bootblack on our streets may yet gain wealth and 
fame, 
And smile to hear them say, he once was poor, but that's no 
shame. 
Upon the crossing of the streets you'll find them every day, 
Some with barely clothes enough to keep the cold away; 
Yet happiness is beaming upon each face secure, 
For well they know they're numbered to be helped among the 
poor. 
There's the working-girls, God save them from poverty and 
shame, 
A cruel word in idle jest might blacken their fair name; 
Then do them all the good you can, and ne'er let it be said— 
You gave them cause to wish themselves as numbered with the 
dead. 
From midnight until early dawn you'll find some hard at work, 
While others in the stores, by day, they gain their bread as 
clerks; 
They do the best they can to keep the wolf from out their door, 
Some future day God will repay the man who helps the poor. 
GIVE BREAD TO THE POOR. 
As sung with tremendous success at the New National Theatre, 
Philadelphia, by FRANK LEW1S. 
I've an object in view I 
would like to unfold, 
It's about this great city that's revelled in gold. 
The pride of our nation well tested above, 
In Philadelphia's great city of brotherly love, 
In the famine of late, though ' tis hard for to state, 
The thought of starvation, and sad was the fate 
Of tte many poor families who had nothing in store, 
Till a 
cry came from Heaven, '• Give bread to the poor l'' 
Now, there's A. T. Stewart, the New York millionaire, 
Who some time ago sought another world's care, 
Would it have hurt his kind heart to throw out a 
dime 
To keep our poor sufferers from prisou it..Il critne,? 
He invested, Um told, in a 
great institato, 
In a 
matter of business, you bet he wa.i cute; 
He was not like Jim Fisk, nor will be 
more, 
With his lightning express giving b 
-end to the poor. 
There's another kind heart, tho' he has been misused, 
In South Carolina, where all was confused; 
He kept down the riot, gave his wilco for peace, 
While the Rads, in the White House, they sat at theirease. 
In the town of Columbia, which all of you know, 
Their suffering was great with hunger and woe ; 
With his shirt sleeves rolled up, like old Jackson at war, 
Stood Governor Wade Hampton 0iving bread to the poor. 
13 
PENNSYLVANIA'S FAVORITE SONS. 
As sung by FRANK LEWIS, with great success. 
I'll sing to you of men so great we lost with deep regret, 
And men whose present deeds are such we never shall forget, 
Whose names are written boldly on the title page of fame, 
That our children in the future might seek for such a 
name. 
To lead an honest, upright life some people think it hard, 
It is the sure and only way our future peace to guard ; 
Look always on the brighter side as the sands of life it runs, 
You may be numbered e'er you die with Pennsylvania's favor-
ite sons. 
Ned Forrest formed the actor's home, a 
rest for poor old inen, 
Whose life was passed upon the stage, a 
home he made for 
them ; 
Great Curtin, our war Governor, each regiment well manned, 
Stephen Girard he won a 
name when he our college planned, 
Sam Randall, now our Speaker, in this State first did live, 
And the patriots in the days of old did freedom to us give ; 
Our library stands supreme, more thanks to Dr. Rush, 
Who left a 
million dollars cash that none its power could crush. 
In this State John Morton lived, in it " Thad." Stevens died, 
From here brave Hancock went to fight when he the foe defied ; 
Within this town Ben. Franklin lies, the glory of all men, 
I 
glory when I 
sing to you ye sons of William Penn. 
Horace Binney was a 
lawyer great, and many cases won, 
James G. Blaine, now great in Maine, is Philadelphia's favorite 
son; 
'Tis here that liberty was born and tyrants met their fate, 
It is the pride of free-born men our noble " Keystone State." 
WHERE IS OAKEY HALL? 
The hit of the season, as- sung for three consecutive months at 
the New National Theatre, Philadelehia„ by FitAxx 
Lewis. 
Written after the sudden disap-
pearance of OAKEY HALL. 
We read in the papers every day some one does disappear. 
The people all will run away and none be left I 
fear; 
Father Adam left his garden, and Eve could not prevail, 
To make him stop a 
moment when he saw the serpent's tail. 
Now Jonah hid himself one day in the tail- fin of a 
shark, 
Boss Tweed he travelled o'er the sea but only for a 
lark. 
The railroad engineers have struck, and for higher wages call, 
The Reading Road is going to smash, but where is Oakey Hall ? 
The policemen, so the prisoners say, they think that clubs are 
trumps, 
Dr. Landis took a 
blue glass pill to cure him of the clumps; 
Jim Bennett is in Europe fighting duels o'er the sea, 
Steve Nash has signed the temperance pledge and joined the 
T. A. B.'s. 
Geo. W. Childs each and every day does affecting rhymes indite, 
He's the champion poet of them all, who epitaphs do write; 
Peter Cooper's wind- bag lately burst, when the price of glue did 
fall, 
They're killing goats for the alms-house poor, but where is 
Oakey Hall ? 
Bill McMullen joined the Free Love Church, he with the box 
goes round, 
But when the collection is turned in there's nothing to be 
found, 
Sim Plaine and Wendell Phillips are united hand in hand, 
Wade Hampton, in South Carolina, as the Governor, takes 
command. 
We hear of nothing now but fighting, in the streets warlike at-
tacks, 
Look at the battles lately fought between the mighty Macks. 
The fun came off on Chestnut street, they had a 
lively ball, 
McKay he blacked McClure's two eyes, but where is Oakey 
Hall? 
Pat Rooney has a 
brand new walk, Mayor Stoltely has a 
corn, 
The hucksters in this mighty town they wish they'd not been 
born. 
General Grant is still in England, dining with kings and queens, 
While Hayes is travelling thro' Vermont living on pork and 
beans. 
Sammy Tilden soon will married be, and have some children 
born, 
Sunset Cox has a 
baby sweet, he's no bachelor forlorn. 
They run steam cars on Market street, but what, does puzzle all, 
Is where is the Centennial money gone, and where is Oakey 
Hall ?

OUR ACTORS OF THE PAST. 
THE HERALD COMPLAINT BOOK. 
As originally sung by FRANK Lmvis, at the Howard Athenamm, 
Boston, Mass. 
I 
have told you of the minstrel of our past and by-gone day, 
I 
will sing you now of actors great who from us have passed 
away, 
Of men who trod the mimic stage, our glory and our pride, 
Of women who have shown so bright, and all the world defied. 
No more will Burton's merry laugh, as " Toodles," greet our ears, 
No more George Holland, in " Rosedale," awake our smiles or 
tears: 
No more will Mrs. Conway her brightest comedies play, 
She was an actress of the past, one of the by-gone day. 
No more as " Sir Giles Overreach " will our great Davenport 
stand, 
Nor yet matilde Heron as " Camille " entrance the land. 
No more will Lucille Western as " Poor Nancy Sykes " defy 
The Brutal husband she still loved and yet not fear to die. 
No more will dear old Ben de liar with joy the footlights see, 
Nor G. L. Fox, the king of clowns, " Humpty Dumpty " net for 
me. 
And Charlotte Cushman we will love while life itself shall last, 
Though as " Meg Merillies" she has gone a 
bright actress of the 
past, 
No more Claude Burroughs speak his lines, our hearts with 
love inspire, 
He fell whh Murdock ' midst the flames a 
victim to the fire. 
No more will Barney Williams as the " Connie Soogah " stand, 
Within the fairy circle with his Colleen hand in hand. 
No more will Mark Smith tune his note to sing his jovial song, 
Ned Forrest face the footlights where his gloricus fame be-
longs ; 
No morr, will Edwin Adams his " Enoch Arden " play, 
A 
brilliant actor of the past from us now torn away. 
A new idea for a 
song, taken from the column in the _V Y. 
Herald, called the " Complaint Book," written by Toxv 
PASTOR, and sung by FRANK LEWIS. 
The hit 
of the season at 
the Academy 
of 
Music, 
Pittsburg. 
Of course in search of novelties are people now-a- days. 
New subjects they are sure to find in novels, songs and plays 
But if in search of something new, you only have to look 
And read the various grumbles in the Herald " Complaint, 
Book." 
POKEY,—This is from a 
gentleman who takes his meals out— 
Mr. Editor, in the restaurant where I 
make my daily calls, 
I 
formd an India rubber shoe in one of my codfish balls: 
Now, will I 
sue the proprietor, or will I 
pinch the cook ? 
Or will I 
show the rascal up in the Herald " Complaint Book ?" 
There's a 
question I

Why Mabel Leonard from the stage they forcibly eject? 
While the ragged urchins on the street they quietly overlook. 
Our Commissioners should look after them.

THE HONEST WORKING CLASSES 
An Original Song by Mr. FRANK LEWIS, 
How the world has wrote the praises of our politicans of fame, sir— 
And balls and suppers given them in honor of their name, Sir. 
The Poets, too, have sung of them, and such kind favor passes ; 
But none have sung in praise of our honest working classes. 
There's many a 
battle has bceri won by those who get no thanks sirs 
The tide of victory oft been turned by the solid poor man's rank Sir: 
Where would they be, these nabobs and dictators of the masses, 
if it was not for the solid votes of our honest working classes. 
The honest, brown face working man, with his hands so tough and 
hard, Sir, 
A trudging to his daily toil, is the noblest work of God, Sir. 
No Duke's or Earl's fine silver plate, e'er equals or surpasses 
'the homely, plain tin dinner pails of our honest working classes. 
Now, I 
think It would be about as well, for those high up in office, 
To try and help the poor man, and feed his empty coffers— 
Take the money that they spend for wine, big suppers and finis 
dashes, 
And feed the starving children of our honest working classes. 
There's the newsboys and the bootblacks, often sick, poor and for. 
lorn, Sir, 
They meet the ignorau snob's contempt, the haughty rich untres 
scorn Sir ; 
But some may go to Congress, and there control the masses— 
A 
noble representative of our honest working classes. 
Now, there are good men, brave and true, who represent our nation 
And who will not be offended at any insinuations: 
There are some, by deeds have earned their names, not by gold or 
clink of glasses, 
Alva have nobly risen, step by step, from our honest working classes

Eminent Men we Have and Have Not, 
As Sung Originally at the Olympic Theatre, N. Y. 
BY FRANK LEWIS. 
Now a 
few days ago while on things ruminating, 
I 
thought of the present, I 
thought of the past. 
I 
thought of the strange things we're every day meeting, 
And to tell you my meaning shall now be my task. 
We have not Patrick Henry, who spoke for our freedom ; 
We have rot Lafayette, who front France came to fight— 
But we have Mr. Grant and his many relations, 
Who would like a 
third term, just t L,et IL1 ,Aters right. 
We have not General Geo. Mead, Ge Ltysbur.,;11's 
But we have the brave Sherm . n, wno marched to tl.e Sea. 
We have not Geo. Peabody, the poor man's true friend— 
But his name in our memory ever shall be. 
We have lost poor Jim Fisk, who sent food to Chicago, 
When the fire fiend upon them made such a 
great raid; 
But we have Moody and Sankey, who set weak people cranky, 
And send you to Glory, all stamped and prepaid. 
We have lost Mr. Lincoln, who gave the slaves Freedom! 
But we have Jay Cooke, who took from the bank all the tin t 
And we have our gallant Phil Sheriden, Winchester's great 
He strove for his country bright laurels to win. 
We have lost our Great Father, our pride and our glory, 
Our Washington, who from our hearts shall ne'er fade: 
But we have gt.11ant Little Mac, who at Antietam fighting, 
Quite proved that in battle he was not afraid. 
Ben Franklin has left us, and Henry Clay also; 
Ben Butler's still with us, one eye on the spoons— 
And 13maam Young still keeps a

THE BELL OF INDEPENDENCE. 
As Sung Originally by FRANK LEWIS, at Fox's American Theatre for 
eight weeks, with tumultuous applause. 
In the days of Glorious Washington our fathers, brave, did try, 
To raise our Starry Banner up in I

And how they fought, and how they won, has history not told ? 
The noble deeds which they lit.ve wrought, those heroes great and

There is not a

but now respects our cause, 
And shrinks in fear front Uncle Sam when Freedom's sword he 
draws.

And all have joined to celebrate our Great Centennial Day.

SCENES ON THE BOWERY, 
Dedicated to M R. HARRY M INER, of Volk's Garden. 
(in Original Song, as Sung by FRANK LEWIS, with im-
mense success. 
I 
have been thro' the streets in each City 
In Germany, England and Rome; 
But the street on which I've made this ditty, 
Is the pride of them all here at home. 
From the pole to the great fiery regions, 
Where the sun in its fierceness is seen, 
There is nought like the Bowery for pleasure, 
And in all the great places I've been. 
CHORUS. 
They may talk of the pleasures of Paris, 
The buildings you see in Berlin; 
The remains of Solomon's Great Temple. 
But the Bowery I 
would rather live in. 
Of course we don't do the Grand Opera, 
With gloves and a 
spy-glass to peep; 
Nor our gents part their hair in the middle, 
And appear like Sankey's lost sheep, 
But you bring your dear wife or your sweetheart, 
Your sister or mother—with glee, 
You enjoy a 
good song and some lager, 
The Bowery's the place, boys, for me. 
They may talk, &c, 
15 the Homestead of mighty Frank Duffy, 
And our great Harry Howard, so brave ; 
The place where he risked his fife boldly, 
When the child from the fire he did save. 
'Tis the home of Ton_ Hamblin and Kirby, 
The triumph of Fox as a 
clown; 
The place Tony Pastor coined money, 
And made his big hit in the town. 
They may talk, & c. 
'Tis the spot Barney Williams appeared in, 
Our Lingard, and many of the rest; 
And our Nt w York's Great favorite, Gus Will aim , 
'‘‘ hose efforts were crowned with success. 
We have not the Swells as oti Broadway, 
Nor the damsels of fashion you'll see ; 
But for bright eyes and sons of hard labor, 
Thty can't befit the Old Bowery. 
They may talk, ike.

.1211 Laugh! And that's Always the 
Last of It. 
Original Music by PROF. JAS. KENNEDY. 
Sung, by Mt. 
FBANg LEWIS, at Fox's Theatre, Philadelphia. 
'Tis my maxim in life to aN oid care and strife, 
And to walk through this world with a 
smile: 
How I 
pity the man, who to laugh never can, 
Has no joy his sad hours to beguile. 
Let Us live by the way, think how short is our stay. 
Do not waste time with foolish repining, 
You will act a 
wise part if you take to your heart. 
Every bright ray of light that is shining. 
CHORUS. 
So a 
fig for despair, I 
will drive away care, 
I 
regret not my life what is past of it: 
If sorrow draws nigh, to defeat it I'll try; 
I'll laugh! and that's the last of it. 
If the girl that I 
love, she should false to me prove, 
Do you think I 
would sit down and cry— 
No 1 
I 
would start out anew, other dear ones pursue, 
And to live out my trouble, would try. 
I'd keep a 
stiff upper lip ; never give up the ship, 
The sad wrinkles of woe ever scorning; 
Thcugh dense be the shroud of a 
darkening to ond, 
'Tis dispelled by the sunlight of morning. 
So a 
fig for despair, &c. 
Did I 
once trust a 
friend and was wronged in the end, 
Still the sweet cup of joy I 
would quaff ; 
And if trouble it came, not a 
soul would I 
blame. 
But my manhood I'd rouse with a 
laugh; 
Not a 
tear would I 
shed, but be jolly instead, 
For sorrow I 
never could borrow; 
I'd with patience abide, ' till the turn of +The tide, 
And the bright sun it shone on the morrow. 
So a 
fig for despair, & d.

An Original Song, as Sung by FRANK LEWIS, with im-
mense success. 
A 
strange name for my song I've selected, 
But still I 
will try you to please ; 
They are men of bad deeds been suspected, 
And I'll call them the great Busy H's. 
Now ifs simply because that same letter, 
Is the one that commences their name; 
So I 
took it for want of a 
better— 
They are men of renown and great fame. 
CHORUS. 
Now Belzebub was the first B, sir, 
He Made Eve steal the fruit from the tree, sir; 
Caused mankind its shame first to see sir, 
He was the most wonderful B. 
Belshazzar one day gave a 
dinner, 
And invited his Senators, all; 
But he found he was scarcely a 
winner, 
When the writing appeared on the wall. 
Brigham Young gets his wives by the hundred. 
He's babies, I'm told, by the score ; 
But not satisfied, the old rascal, 
He is constantly wishing for more. 
CHORUS. 
Ben Butler with one eye does see sir— 
He goes that same eye on a 
fee sir— 
He is a 
most comical B, sir, 
That ever this nation did see. 
Mr. Beecher, to the people still preaches, 
Giving sly winks at each pretty Miss ; 
Henry Bowen says bad things he teaches 
Fie is best at a 
sw 
fragrant kiss, 
Spain speaks of apologies iziven— 
Will that bring the dead back to life15 
Will that aid the wives and the children 
Of the victims who fell in the strife? 
CHORUS. 
We want Burril, the butcher, on high, sir, 
On a 
gibbet that shall reach the sky, sir 
Like the men he has murdered, to die, sir; 
Not till then will we listen to Spain. 
Mr. Blaine is a 
B 
that was Speaker. 
He hails from away down in Maine; 
For the chair in the White House, a 
seeker, 
No fool of a 
B, was old Blaine. 
Mr. Babcock, the gay and the frisky, 
Is a 
B 
that went in for the tin; 
He made his small pile out of whiskey— 
But stealing by law is no sin. 
CHORUS. 
Boss Tweed and Boss Shephard, so great, sir, 
Made cash at a 
tremendous rate, sir; 
Our currency went to inflate, sir— 
These men were such Busy B's. 
But the worst B 
of all in the nation, 
Who late did his pockets well fill--
Is the one from the poor soldier's ration 
Did steal what he could at Fort Sill. 
Aaron Burr, we are told, was a 
Traitor— 
For his country he did not care a 
rap ; 
Though, peihaps his proud soul did hate her— 
Was he worse than our General Belknap? 
CHORUS. 
Such men you'll agree with me, sir, 
Are a 
disgrace to the land of the free, sir ; 
'Tis in prison they all ought to be, sir, 
These wonderful great Busy B's.

An Original Song by FRANK L EWIS. 
In the battle of life, if you would win in the strife, 
Should you fail at the start, try again: 
Keep a 
stiff upper lip, never give up the ship, 
Sunshine always comes after rain. 
Whatever you do, strive to push your way through, 
And keep this sound maxim in mind, 
Fortune favors the brave, she'll yet come to your aid— 
It is only a 
question of time, 
CHORUS. 
So, if for a 
fortune or fame you may strive 
Or a 
wife suited just to your mind : 
Go in with a 
will, your time will come s• ill - 
It is only a 
question of time. 
Our Conductors are fond of milk punches, thy say: 
But the Bell Punches, they made them sick, 
For the Spotters discovered their secret machines, 
They rang under their arms with a 
click. 
Now, the secret is out, and their pickings they miss : 
Knocking down's almost ceased on our lines; 
But someeYankee will invent an improvement on this — 
It is only a 
question of time. 
Directors are sharp, but Conductors are fly, 
They have got these things down pretty floe; 
They will soon punch this Bell Punch, and send it 
high! 
It is only a 
quest on of time. 
My friend Jones has been married fi‘e years now or so, 
He's the father of five—so they say__ 
But what's strange to relate and curious to know, 
I

But my mother-in-law says, now don't you despair, 
Fight h 
out, my boy, on that same line ! 
Dame Nature will be good to you never fear— 
It is only a 
question of time.

If your family affairs are like mine 
If your house has no heir, why never despair—,

THE AMERICAN FLAG. 
Mn. FRANK LEwis' Great Original Song, as Sung by him 
over 100 times, in New York and Philadelphia. 
onderful that glorious emblem, boys, the banner of the free, 
'11,e stars and stripes which brightly wave, supreme o'er land and sea 
it floated proud when nations tried to drag it through the mir,t, 
it filled brave men in every clime with patr.otic fire. 
It shed its radiance through the world on Concord's Village Green ! 
Wherever Liberty, it shines, that emblem can be seen.

It floated proud at Trenton, boys, where prostrate lay the foe; 
O'er Washiligton it placed its wings, as in the boat he stood, 
When bold the Delaware he crossed, and braved its angry flood. 
It brightly waved at Dallymount, when Gildersleeve he shot ; 
When Bodine, Fulton, and the rest, the golden prizes got; 
And when the Cumberland went down ' mid screams of wild deepair, 
It proudly floated o'er the wreck, undaunted still was there.

It spread out its victorious stripes with Scott at Lundy's Lane. 
It went with Rough and Ready against a

On sea, that emblem, far and wide, is worshipped by our tars;

THE ACTOR'S GREAT BALL. 
An Original Song by PRANK LEWIS. 
As snug by hine 
with Great Success. 
A 
comical story I'm going to tell you, 
I 
wrote it to please both the great and the small; 
It's about some good fun I 
had in this City, 
One night at the Actor's Professional Ball. 
The first set of Quadrilles was danced by Tony Pastor, 
Of which Clara Morris the figures did call. 
Mr. Daly and Pique waltzed round faster and faster— 
There was fun, you can bet at the Actor's 
reat Ball! 
Josh Hart brought his Eagle to fly at the party, 
John Brougham a 
kiss from Miss Neilson he took i 
Lester Wallack, he shaved off his whiskers, and gave thorn 
Unto the two Orphans of Sheridan Shook. 
Mr. Levy, he played on his Cornet, a 
Solo, 
As he sat in the Crucible of Oakey Hall I 
Pat Rooney and Harry Bennett, to enliven the meeting, 
Danced the Tra-la-loo, at the Actor's Great Ball. 
Jennie Engle appeared with her flags used in singing, 
And Sol Smith Russell commenced for to blow. 
Harry Hill's Female Boxers went in to fling him. 
To the place underneath, where all Actors do go. 
Then Kelly and Leon went in rough and tumble, 
Tore Leon's new dress, which cost thousands, he'll say. 
Gus Williams got his steam up and bursted his boiler, 
And John Hart, the skeleton, he fainted away. 
Billy Pastor then tried to waltz with Miss Markham, 
But his body was larce and his legs they were small— 
So he got the two Braharns to drop all their H's, 
They tripped up Jennie Hughes, her sweet vocals and all. 
Anna Dickinson then danced, her crown of thorns wearing. 
Which gave to the critics an unmerciful shock. 
While Jarrett & Palmer made Tooker keep swearing— 
There was no boat afloat like the great Plymouth Rock! 
As daylight approached, the fun kept increasing; 
Mr. Theodore Moss called his Jockey a 
fool— 
Then Boucicault came in with a 
play he had stolen, 
And closed up the daylights of friend John F. Poole. 
Just then occurred what you would call a 
commotion; 
Kate Claxton had Fannie Davenport Pinned ,gainst the wall. 
Harrigan & Hart then appeared in their unequalled effusions, 
And that put an end to the Actors Great Ball!

THE PATRIOT'S DREAM. 
Copyrighted 1876, and Music Pub. E. H. HARDING, 229 Bowery, 11. 
Written and adapted by FRAXIC LEWIS, 
0-ae morn when thinking o'er events, 
In our Central Park so great, 
Oa a 
rustic bench I 
sat, 
O'er things to ruminate; 
When sleep o'ercame me for a 
time, 
A. dense mist did arise; 
A 
panorama of strange forms 
Did pass before my eyes ! 
I 
r 
used aloft my wond'ring gaze, 
It seemed to pierce the clouds. 
As by me pass'd, in strange array, 
• A 
great and bustling crowd. 
I 
notic'd each familiar face, 
And marked each stirring scene, 
The record of a 
hundred years-
1 
saw them in my dream. 
The fog to me it cleared away, 
There came a 
brilliant light, 
And as a 
Keystone to the Arch 
Theie shone a 
rainbow bright! 
And in the centre Freedom stood, 
Aloft—she rais'd her hand— 
And pointed, as they pass'd me by, 
lint) the patriot band! 
I 
saw the men of Boston march, 
So noiseless to the Sea, 
To strike the Keynote of our fame, 
And overthrow the tea; 
And then I 
saw them swiftly go 
'Co Concord's distant town, 
Where low the Union Jack did droop, 
By Freedom's sons cast down. 
I 
next saw Lafayette embark 
To cross the raging main; 
Saw Warren lying stark and stiff, 
When in the battle slain ; 
Saw Putnam ride his gallant steed 
Way down those stairs, so swift, 
And Washington upon the ice 
Of Delaware, adrift! 
I 
next did see our gallant boys 
In Valley Forge, forlorn; 
And still their hearts with patriot fir, 
Defied the wintry storm; 
Then came upon my vision 
A 
dark cloud in the sky— 
It was the traitor, Arnold, 
That in shame was passing ley. 
A 
ray of light the cloud dispelled, 
As Paulding glided by 
With Major Andre in his grasp, 
As he went forth to die ! 
Saw Jefferson the paper write, 
Which made us slaves no more! 
Our glorious Constitution, boys! 
As wrote in days of yore: 
Saw Lincoln sign the Freedom 
Of all men throughout the land! 
And Ethan Allen take the Fort, 
By Lake Champlaine does stand; 
Saw Jackson with his cotton bales, 
Defy the invading foe; 
And Taylor hold our banner up 
Way down in Mexico. 
But at this moment I 
awoke, 
As loud a 
bell did ring, 
And saw unto the breeze our Flag 
Its graceful emblem fling! 
I 
saw old Independence Ball. 
So bright in the sun's ray, 
As Hancock to the people spoke, 
our Centennial Day !" 
And all the spirits of my dream 
Did join in joyful cry— 
This is the year of Seventy-Six— 
The Fourth day of July! 
And sweet Columbia, far above, 
She pointed down with pride 
"Unto our Flag, and proudly said— 
"4It has the world, defied f-
35 
WHAT legions of friends always bless us, 
When golden success gilds our way, 
How they smile as they softly address us, 
So cordial, good humored and gay. 
But oh if the sun of prosperity 
Has set, then how quickly they frown, 
And cry out in tones of severity, 
Kick the man don't you see that he's down. 
CHORE'S. 
Then let all your dealings be honest and true, 
And do unto others as you'd have them to do, 
Sickness and sorrow may yet come to you, 
So lift up a 
man when he's down. 
What then if you had not a 
sorrow, 
Your heart was as open as day, 
Your friends when they wanted to borrow, 
You'd oblige and ne'er ask them to pay, 
But when if a 
friend you ne'er slighted, 
You wander about through the town, 
This friend becomes very near sighted, 
And don't seem to know you when down. 
Then let all, &c. 
Then give me the heart that forever, 
Is free from the worlds selfish rust, 
And the man whose high noble endeavor, 
Is to raise fallen men 
om the dust, 
And when in adversity's ocean, 
A 
victim is likely to drown, 
All hail to the man whose devotion, 
Will lift up this man when he's down. . 
Then let all, &c. 
Motto Song. 
Sung by FRANK LEWIS with great success. 
This world is advancing each moment and hour, 
And startling improvements are made, 
Each nation is striving to gain greater power, 
All others to throw in the shade. 
And each individual struggles along, 
For he knows that when life is begun, 
To gain great distinction ; he really must try 
To do something that's never been done. 
This city has many attractions, I 
own, 
But still there is something amiss, 
The streets and the parks should be kept neat and cleal k, 
My idea for improvement is this. 
There are plenty of good honest men out of work, 
With hunger and debt overrun, 
They are willing to toil, let us give them the chance 
It is something that ought to be done. 
Our country is burdened with debt and distress, 
Its people are suffering, too. 
Our finances are in a 
terrible mess, 
And the prospect at present looks blue. 
There is only one way to prosperity now, 
For corruption has had a 
long run, 
We should have the right man at the head of our land, 
It is something that ought to be done. 
WHAT THE OLD COCK SPARROW SAID. 
As sung by FRANK LEWIS with immense applause. 
One day I 
took a 
walk, rambling thro' the Central Park, 
It was at the close of a 
bright Autumn day, 
To enjoy the evening breeze as it swift sped thro' the trees, 
And watch the fountain's water brightly play. 
After walking once around, a 
rustic bench I 
found, 
And sitting down a 
moment just to rest, 
When a 
voice I 
heard above, saying 
Soon to you I'll prove 
That honesty of purpose is the best.. 
As I 
looked up with surprise, a 
strange sight met my eyes, 
Some fifty sparrows gathered o'er my head; 
A 
big cock sparrow spoke, with age his feathers broke, 
And this was what the old cock sparrow said. 
" ' Tis strange such things to hear, we are getting worse each 
year, 
The laboring man now cannot get a 
meal, 
About fifty cents a 
day is all they earn for pay, 
Its no wonder that the poor man has to steal. 
And our parsons do not preach, or longer virtue teach, 
At secret kissing they are most expert; 
And our politicians all for their living shout 
A 
bawl, 
And talk of nothing but that bloody shirt. 
And our lecturers who roam, like naughty men from home, 
Through sleeping cars in dreams be blindly led, 
Like Tilton, sweet to furl his arms ' round some pretty girl!" 
This was part of what the old cock sparrow said. 
" 
To the demagogues who dare'Ilk again of civil war, 
On the Fourth of March ' twi I 
be all right, I 
say , 
Boss Tweed is back again from that dirty land called Spain, 
And I 
hope that in confinement he'll not stay. 
For. supposing he did rob, no poor man wanted a 
job, 
He took it from the itch to give the poor! 
It\ 
I'd rather run die risk, be ruled by men like him and Fisk, 
For then no beggars hungered at your door. 
Of such things soon we'll tire, look at the great Brooklyn fire; 
They condemned the theatres—when the folks were dead! 
Had they done it but before, we should not the fire deplore"— 
This was part of what the old cock sparrow said. 
" 
In the election long since gone, none knows which man has 
won, 
They did the " counting" just themselves to please; 
Let Returning Boards act fair, and do things on the square, 
And we care not if it's Tilden or it's Hayes. 
But one thingve must see, in this land so great and free, 
That work in plenty shall be got for all; 
And the scoundrels who would lower the wages of the poor, 
How quickly we will send them to the wall!" 
At this a 
shout did rise, which ascended to the skies, 
From the sparrows that did flutter o'er my head; 
They said his words were right, as they flew into the night, 
And they voted all the old cock sparrow said.

Frank Lewis's Great Local Statue Song. 
As sung by him at the different Theatres with success. 
WE are erecting many statues to great people in our land, 
And well I 
love to honor them, a 
noble gallant band. 
In Union Square stands Washington, the chief who made out 
name. 
And honest Abraham Lincoln, almost of an equal fame. 
And in the centre Lafayette beholds the noble work, 
And fifty others proudly stand, in the City of New York. 
So I 
myself have made a 
list of men who fame have won, 
That should have statues made for them, for things which they 
have done. 
So now I'll open out my list, and tell you in my song, 
The position that each statue holds, as best to him belongs. 
I'd have Belknap cheating soldiers out of rations every day, 
And Mr. Schenck slipping the cut, when poker he did play. 
I'd have a 
crucible fast tied on the back of Oakey Hall, 
And Grant a 
smoking a 
cheap segar, with two bull- dogs great 
and small. 
I'd have Harriet Beecher Stowe, :', st tied on the back of Byron 
Ghost, 
And Sankey's hundred sheep, served up in one big mutton roast. 
I'd have an Alderman in great surprise, putting on a 
nice clean 
shirt, 
A Policcman seeking danger, where there's no chance to be hurt. 
A 
Ballet Girl with nothing on, whirling round upon her toes, 
Each Politician safc in jail, playing chequers with his nose. 
I'd have Peter Cooper's Greenbacks, spread around like the 
Suns' ray 
And every workingman should earn, lot: of them every day. 
I'd have Ben. Butler with his larboarcl eye, out upon a 
taro, 
And Hayes as he took his seat, in the Presidentia] chair.

GOD BLESS OUR DEAR OLD FLAG. 
Dedicated to my esteemed friend Miss C. E. 
DE 
SHEPPARD, 
with best wishes. 
Original song, as sung by FRANK LEms, at 
the New National Theatre, Philadelphia. 
IN this glorious land of freedom, exciting times have been, 
I 
often picture in my mind, each great and stirring scene. 
I 
never looked upon the place, where our starry flag did fly, 
But the great events of by-gone days, to picture them I'd try. 
'Twas a 
noble sight at Yorktown, when Washington did stand. 
And took the sword from that great lord, who did invade our 
native land. 
He tried his best to win the fight, and low our banner drag, 
But the Yankee boys rose in their might, and saved our dear 
old flag. 
Again when shot and shell they flew, like hailstones thick and 
fast, 
A gallant youth he braved them all, as he clung to the mast. 
He seized our country's emblem, which- had been shot away, 
And waved it in the foernan's face, way down in Mobile bay, 
A Yankee cheer it then went up, in triumph from our fleet, 
And soon the enemy gave way, defeated, cowed and beat. 
The boy descended to the deck, of Farragut we brag, 
And every brave tar with joy cried out, " God bless our dear 
own old flag." 
Again when trouble came us o'er, and darkest was the licur, 
A noble general staunch and brave, he proved his mighty power. 
He stood upon the battle plain, as thousands did him fight, 
His emblem was our Stars and Stripes, his motto " Truth and 
Right." 
Though treated bad by friends at home, he scorned the fight to 
yield, 
He swore he'd win the victory, or perish on the field. 
He led his columns manfully, repelled each fierce attack, 
The battle was Antietam boys, the hero, Little Mac. 
And when the great Centennial came, each nation in this world, 
Did bless our glittering emblem, when its bunting was wisfurl'd 
They came from Asia's sandy plains, from Afric's burning clime, 
From far Australia's lonely wilds, from Europe's sunny Rhiue. 
They came to see the poor man's home, where the Sun sinks in 
the West, 
Where every wanderer finds a 
bed, and is with plenty blest. 
And when our banner bright went up, no tyrants flaunting rag, 
The nations all with joy they cried, God bless that dear old flag!

WE WANT A 
PRESIDENT, 
As sung by FRANK LEWIS, throughout the Country during 
the late exciting election. 
EXCITEMENT now is all the rage in these United States, 
The people want to know who'll be the lucky candidates, 
Now I 
show no partiality, while my rhymes I 
do present, 
But I 
hope we'll get an honest man for our next President. 
We want no present-taking man, who thinks of naught but gain 
We want a 
man who'll bring us back, the good old-times again. 
When peace and plenty rules the land, and funds more rightly 
spent, 
We want a 
man like honest Abe. for our next President. 
Our Country is a 
glorious one, the finest on the earth, 
We've just passed the Centennial of this great nation's birth. 
As marksmen we were champions, last September at Creedmoor 
But to make our rulers we must show a 
clearer score. 
We want no men in office who will violate their trust, 
By shielding " Crooked Whiskey Rings," or doing things unjust 
We care not for their politics, if they're on honest purpose bent, 
We want a 
true and worthy statesman, for our next President. 
We want no men who try to make of politics a 
trade, 
And tried to throw our honest name forever in the shade. 
We've had enough of Useless Grant, and his relations too, 
We want a 
man who'll keep his oa4 .i 
and the constitution too. 
V° do not want a 
wooden man, we do not want a 
fool, 
Ve want a 
man with ::.ommon sence, who can't be made a 
tool. 
We want a 
man like Washington, who never stole a 
cent, 
Cion this Country will be bles 1

I 
Wonder What They're Going to do Next, 
An origninal song, sung by FRANK LEWIS, at the Theatre 
Comique, St. Louis, Mo., with rounds of applause. 
In the century now gone, there has been many battles won 
And upon this subject I 
will take my text; 
From things that are absurd, this idea to me occurred— 
I 
wonder what they're going to do next ? 
When this world it first began, Father Adam was the man, 
He lived alone—which made him much perplexed; 
So a 
rib he gave away, a 
nice wife to make, they say, 
I 
wonder what they're going to do next? 
Mr. Moody lost a 
sheep when the shepherd was asleep, 
And Sankey counted only ninety-nine; 
Anna Dickinson wrote a 
play on the topics of the day, 
Gordon Bennett's roaming in a 
foreign clime. 
The ladies in our land, they have formed a 
temperance band, 
But their husbands only stronger cocktails mixed; 
Theodore Tilton, it is said, has been getting in the wrong bed, 
I 
wonder what he's going to do next ? 
They've made a 
saint of Brigham Young, so many babes to him 
belong, 
Sent Quakers to fight the Indian foe; 
They let Custer lose his life, in the battle's deadly strife, 
Because they had no soldiers there to go. 
They have lowered the poor man's pay—he but a 
dollar gets 
a 
day I 
While the heads of each department are well fixed; 
When their swindles are found out, they laugh at us and shout, 
I 
wonder what they're going to do next? 
Orignal Motto Song, Sung by FRANK LEWIS.

SOME hundreds of mottoes to you have been sung,

Give Me the Man with an Honest Heart. 
As sung by FRANK LEWIS. 
Give me the man with an honest heart, 
I 
care not what he be, 
He may be rich, he may be poor, 
It matters not to me; 
lie may not wear a 
silken vest, 
Or boast of high degree, 
But if he owns an honest heart, 
his nature's all to me. 
Cuonrs. 
All praise then be to hint 
Who acts a 
noble part, 
For a 
right good man is he, 
Who owns an honest heart. 
What If a 
man can learning boast, 
And wealth of golden ore, 
-Yet, if he lacks an honest heart, 
I 
call him still but poor; 
Speak not to me of wealth and rank, 
They are bubbles on the sea, 
And man may dwell in gilded halls, 
But may not honest be. 
All praise then, etc. 
Now if he owns an honest heart, 
So gentle, true and kind, 
We need not search the wide world o'er, 
A 
better man to find. • 
Then give to every man his due, 
Who acts an holiest plan, 
It is the heart and not the coat 
That makes the honest man. 
All praise then, etc.

THE WATERMILL. 
As recited by GUS W ILLIAMS, at the Olympic Theatre. 
Listen to the watermill, through the livelong day, 
How the clicking of its wheel wears the hours away, 
Languidly the autumn wind stirs the greenwood leaves, 
From the fields the reapers sing, binding up the sheaves; 
And a 
proverb haunts my mind, as a 
spell is cast— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Autumn winds revive no more leaves that once are shed, 
And .he sickle cannot reap corn once gathered; 
And the rippling stream flows on, tranquil, deep and still, 
Never gliding back again to the watermill. 
Truly speaks the proverb old, with a 
meaning vast— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Take the lesson to thyself, loving heart and true, 
Golden years are fleeting by, youth is passing, too; 
Learn to make the most of life, lose no happy day, 
Time will never bring thee back chances swept away. 
Leave no tender word unsaid, love, while love shall last— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Work while yet the daylight shines, man of strength and will, 
Never does the streamlet glide useless by the mill; 
Wait not till to-morrow's sun beams upon the way, 
All that thou canst call thine own lies in thy— to- day, 
Power, intellect and health may not always last— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Oh I 
the wasted hours of life that have drifted by, 
Ohl the good we might have done, lost without a 
sigh! 
Love that we might once have saved by a 
single word, 
Thoughts conceived, but never penned, perishing unheard, 
Take the proverb to thine heart, take and hold it fast— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Ohl love thy God and fellow-man, thyself consider last, 
For come it will, when thou must scan dark errors of the past; 
And when the fight of life is o'er, and earth recedes from view, 
And Heaven in all its glory. shines, 'midst the pure, the good 
the true. 
Then you'll see more clearly the proverb deep and vast— 
.The mill wP1 never grind with the water that is past.

Respectfully dedicated to Mr. W . 
H. 
MORTON, 
Theatre Comique, Washington, D. C. 
A companion song to the Minstrel Band, an original song, 
as sung by FRANK LEWIS, 
at the Howard Athenaeum, Boston, Mass. 
I HAVE sung of the minstrels who have all passed away, 
Whose names I 
love to recall, 
Of Bryant, Seymour and Unsworth, 
And Eph. Horn, the last of them all. 
But now as a-token of sorrow I'll sing, 
Of our actors and actresses that are fled, 
Of the bright mimic heroes who have stood on these boards, 
But whose memory shall never be dead. 
CHORUS. 
Then success to the stage, and the people who win, 
Upon it a 
record and name, 
Who gain for themselves while our memory shall last, 
A 
seat in the temple of fame. 
There's an actress now gone to the land of the blest, 
The foot-lights will see her no more, 
As a 
true artist, she well stood the test, 
But the day of her triumph is o'er. 
Meg Merrilles now is a 
thing of the past, 
For the queen of the stage, she is gone, 
And none is left to wear the gold crown, 
Charlotte Cushman so often has worn. 
CHORUS. 
There's America's tragedian, who so nobly has worked, 
To win on the stage a 
great name, 
The late Edwin Forrest deservedly has gained, 
A seat in the temple of fame. 
Lucille -Western has gone, but her name ne'er forgot, 
Shall be written in letters of gold. 
Mrs. Conway, Brooklyn's favorite actress also, 
But in song shall her triumph be told. 
Claude Burroughs was found when the day-light appeared, 
As he lay by the side of his friend, 
Harry Murdoch he died, as the flames he defied, 
And his drama of life was at end. 
CIIORUS. 
There is also another, may his name ever be, 
As his own native island kept green, 
Our favorite Irish Comedian, Barney Williams now holds, 
A 
seat in the temple of fame.

THE BLOODLESS DUEL. 
FRANK LEWIS'S Great Song. 
'TWAS a 
cold winter's night, when King Frost held the swat. 
And darkness it reigned all around, 
A 
mysterious man with revenge in his mind, 
Did wait till his victim was found. 
Waiting, he'd sworn he would wait till the dawn, 
For the man who had promised to wed 
The sister he loved, and he vowed in his wrath, 
He would " punch" the young editor's head. 
At last a 
tall figure appeared on the steps, 
As down to his sleigh he did hie, 
But he scarcely had gained the sidewalk, ere a 
blow 
Caused him in the gutter to lie. 
The mysterious man cried " Revenge I 
will have 
And the wrongs of my sister efface." 
And " May" to " December," he quickly did turn 
In a 
map on the editor's face. 
Fighting, they fought, as young heroes did tight, 
In the glorious days of old Greece. 
When to part them, alas, not a " cop" was in sight, 
Nor a 
blue-coated squad of police. 
The poor man was lifted up by his friends, 
They his story of wrong tried to draw, 
He muttered, " The girl I 
did love as my life 
But could not stand that old mother-in-law." 
The scene it is changed to a 
bleak turnip field, 
And grim death, hovered high in the air. 
Not knowing which State, human blood would be shed, 
Maryland, or the great Delaware. 
Slaughter, yes that was the name of the town, 
, 
Where the foemen were ready to fight, 
but they stood Stich a 
distance, where the seconds them placed 
That they seemed for to be out of sight. 
Blood- thirsty, you bet, for red blood it was shed, 
The foernan they can't explain how. 
At the word, quick they fired, but a 
strange thing to say, 
The only man shot was a 
cow. 
Gordon Bennett he winked, Fred Vey blew his nose, 
Their hearts with forgiveness did swell, 
They threw down their pistols, ran quick o'er the snow, 
Into each others arms quick they fell. 
Dr. Phelps then his surgical instrument drew, 
Not a 
ball from the men to pull back, 
nut to put it by far, to a 
much better use, 
A 
cork from a 
bottle extract. 
They all did shake hands, ana soon started for home, 
With blood- thirsty duels content, 
Ad 
the world still moves on, though the battle is o'er.

THINGS THAT OUGHT NEVER TO BE. 
An original song, sung by FRANK LEWIS, with great success, 
THERE'S a 
great many things have been done in this world, 
You will find it so hard to believe, 
A 
great many born are quite good of their kind, 
While some seem but made to deceive. 
So your attention I'll ask for a 
moment or more, 
And the theme of my song you will see, 
My subject I'm sure will please one and all, 
Of things that ought not to be. 
C 
Prom beginning of time, until this very day, 
From swindles we've never been tree, 
And I'll try to describe as I 
go thro' my song, 
Some things that ought never to be. 
Our young-ladies now wear a 
comical dress, 
Blown up like a 
bladder behind, 
Madam fashion ordains it should set tight in front, 
With a 
baloon and a 
clothes- prop combined. 
On the top of their heads a 
long steeple they wear. 
'Tis,a mountain of back-hair to see; 
8hould, they ever.fall over, they'd never get up, 
Its a 
thing that ought never to be. 
From beginning of, &O. 
I 
have known a 
poor girl trudging home --am her work 
As by some rich fop she would run, 
Proclaim the attention of some passer by 
From this ape in the form of a 
man 
I 
have seen gallant sailors and soldiers also, 
Who were wounded by land and sea, 
Turning round a 
hand-organ the picture of woe, 
It's a 
thing that ought never to be. 
From beginning of, &e. 
When a 
poor man is arrested for stealing a 
loaf, 
His pale starving family to save, 
He will go for a 
year, with hard labor I'm told, 
While his children may go to the grave, 
But let a 
swell steal by millions, or, else rob a 
bank, 
With the money he soon will be free, 
They'll imprison the poor man while the rich live at ease, 
It's a 
thing that ought never to be. 
From beginning of, tte. 
As sung by WILL. MORTON, 
When but a 
little boy, oh, it really was my joy 
To visit the theatre, I'll admit, 
And how happy I 
would be, the performances to see 
While seated in the gallery or pit. 
I 
fancied all was real, that the curtain did reveal, 
But since that I 
have passed beyond my teens; 
I 
begin to understand, though in front it may look grand 
It's very different just behind the scenes. 
f.3o if if you will attend for a 
moment, now my friends, 
I'll do the best within my humble means, 
To show to you to-night, though in front it may look bright, 
It's very different just behind the scenes. 
\ 
The comedian is one, who, while causing lots of fun, 
His heart may yet hang heavy in his breast; 
And he who plays the king, though it seems a 
curious thing, 
In private may be very poorly dressed. 
Then the ballet girl so fair, who goes floating throfigh the air, 
And looks like little angels there Instead ; 
Sometimes they have to roam, into a 
wretched home, 
And oftentimes go supperless to bed. 
And those who play the parts, of the men with stony hearts, 
And look as if their tempers were like fiends; 
Could you see them while away, you certainly would say 
They're the mildest looking men behind the scenes. 
Now there's many a 
married pair, I've no doubt you are aware, 
Who in public are so tender and so kind; 
But could you only see them at home in privacy, 
A 
very difierent state of things you'd find. 
LSometimes it is the wife who causes all the strife, 
Sometinaes it is the husband who's to blame ; 
_ _  
55 
But be that as it may, who causes all the fray, 
Their quarreling continues just the same. 
And oft they try to hide from all the world outside, 
The snarls and jars with which their household teem , 
And often when you hear them call each other dear, 
They hate each other just behind the scenes. 
Now:lts just the same in life, though what lots of care an 
strife. 
And suffering some folks will undergo 
Just to cut a 
shine, and to make themselves look fine, 
They think of nothing else but outside show. 
Some fancy and suppose, that those who wear good clothes, 
Always are they richest and the best ; 
But an honest heart and mind, is respected most you'll find, 
No matter whether rich or poorly dressed. 
Then no matter where we go, from the highest to the low, 
From peasantry ' way up to kings or queens, 
Whatever we enjoy, therb's something to annoy, 
If we could only peep behind the scenes. 
I. 
PITT BY FOR A 
RAINY DAY. 
OFTTIMES the world may laugh and jeer at what I'm going to 
to say, 
That is, provide yourselves, my friends, in case of a 
rainy day; 
For if you don't, when you grow old, on what I 
say depend, 
If you can't help zrourself, 'tis hard to find a 
friend. 
CHORCg. 
So now be careful, and be wise, and like:me, stow away, 
A 
little pelf, to protect yourself, in ease of a 
rainy day; 
Be not extravagant or mean, have just what you require, 
Be kind and provident to all, it is my heart's desire; 
When I 
see my fellow creature is trodden down with strife, 
To help him on the wad is a 
proud time of my life. 
So now be careful, &c. 
a' Waste not, want not," my motto is a 
maxim I 
would teach, 
And this another I'd prescribe: "Touch nothing out of reach ;-
For " honesty's best policy," so honest people say, 
And just remember, though but smali, put up for a 
rainy day. 
So new be careful, &c. 
A 
pin a 
day, is a 
groat a 
year, which proves that the smalle.s. 
mite 
Put by will soon accumulate, and shows my words are right; 
So persevere when in your youth, and then when old you'll say, 
I 
care not how the world treats me, I 
thought of a 
rainy clay. 
So now be careful, &e. 
57 
rrn hale, rm 
jolly, as you can see, and I 
like my friends to call, 
Though the best of friends I've ever found was my pocket, after 
nil; 
For that old friend sticks to me still, through thick and thin I 
say 
If you would he advised by me, put by for a 
rainy day. 
So now be careful, &c. 
"A friend in need's a 
friend indeed," but how often when you'rt, 
poor, 
Those friends will pass you one by one, and on you close the door ; 
So let your motto be like mine, whate'er the world may sax. 
Look out for number one, that is—put by for a 
rainy day. 
So now be careful, 41r4

CRIME, 
Music published by WIIITE X 
tton.Laun. Boston, IfiagE 
I'VE been thinking of late, I've been thinking. 
My thoughts I 
can scarcely define, 
I've been thinking why people can wonder, 
At this terrible increase of crime; 
Cries, Old Uncle Sam it's a " poser," 
There's a 
something I 
can't understand, 
I 
would just give a 
trifle to know, sir, 
Why crime should increase in our land. 
I'm sure that we've plenty of gold, sir, 
Our banks are as full as can hold, sir, 
We could buy the whole world I 
am told, sirs 
Yet still, there's an increase of crime. 
It's true what you say, Uncle Samuel., 
We've plenty of gold laid away, 
Mouldy with mildew and rust, sir, 
Guarded by night and by day; 
While you like a 
dog in the manger, 
Your f, „id to yourself you confine, 
When a 
little would make a 
great change, sir, 
In this terrible increase of crime. 
For expenses you don't care a 
groat, air, 
Polkicians, you feed a 
whole lot, sir, 
While the poor man, with hunger may rot., " 
And still you wonder at crime. 
1 
am sure you will own Uncle Sam, sir, 
Temptation is hard to resist, 
Just look at our poor working girl, sire 
Striving her best to erist • 
Can you wonder at weak constitutions, 
When blood-sucking firms, barely give, 
Enough to keep off destitution, 
A 
girl, though she's poor, she must live. 
There's our poor needle girl, God defend hoc, 
With feelings as proud and as tender, 
As your proud city lady, remember, 
Uncle Sam can you wonder at crime. 
Can you wonder at crime can you wonder, 
When you see the police on his beat, 
Arresting a 
poor starving man, sir, 
For begging his bread on the street; 
While the thief on the corner stands grinnini, 
In the broad open light of the day, 
Your pockets he'd pick for a 
shilling, 
And the law cannot touch himIthey say. 
He smiles with contempt and derision, 
He defies a 
whole police division, 
While the poor man is sent off to prison, 
And still you wonder at crime. 
Just think while your drinking your wine, sir 
How the poor of our land they are fed, 
While you, with your rich folks can dine, sir, 
'Tis a 
god-send for them to get bread; 
Go visit the home of the poor, sir, 
such sights you willuever behold, 
To our prisons then go and explore, sir, 
And scatter your hoatnings of geld. 
A 
little would soon break asunder, 
The chains the poor sufferer is under.

THE WASHINGTON BALL. 
Dedicated to my friend TOMMY TURNER, of the 3 
Turner Bros. 
As Sung by FRANK LEWIS, originally, at Fox's American Thea-
tre, Philadelphia, with great success. 
A comical story I 
am going to tell you, 
And I 
know it win please if you listen to me. 
I 
attended a 
party in WaElaington City, 
And 
mention a 
few of the sights I 
did see. 
was a 
Ball that was iven to Moody and Sankey, 
Of which Mayer Wickam the figures did call. 
Mysel f, Governor Tilden, and Barnum's What s 
It, 
Vi e 
formed the first set, at the Washington Ball. 
We al- took 
snifter when each dance was over, 
'Till getting excited, they quick came to blows. 
The. British Ambassa dor went tor Dom Pedro, 
And received for his trouble a 
bang on the nose. 
Mr. Senate: Thurman, he then got entangled 
With sweet Mrs Tilton, while arranging her shawl; 
And our great Tony Pastor, he bursted his boiler, 
Too fat for to dance, at the Was', ington Ball. 
Vice President Ferry he then did get merry: 
He borrowed a 
dime from a 
fierce looking chap ; 
He said, from his stealings, he soon would repay • t, 
When an Agent he was made by Mr. Bel nap. 
Tennie Clatlin was seen squeezing Blair in the comer ; 
Mr. Beecher shed t 
ears a 
s 
he kissed them all; 
Bessie Turner took a 
cocktail, she said 'twas to warm her, 
And that staited the fight at the Washington Ball 
Miss Kate Fields gave a 
Lecture on Nursing the Baby, 
She said Brigham Young was the best of them all; 
She grasped Lester Wallack by the tip of nis whiskers, 
And she shook the black dye from hi - mouetache and all. 
The Congressmen, drunk, they lay under the table 
In a 
knot, tied together, both little and tall; 
Mr. Moody gave Sankey a 
kick in the stomach, 
Just to keep up the fun, at the Washington Ball. 
Col. Fred. Grant drew his sword for the first time in battles 
He as b 
ed when the fight - 'as going to begin; 
He said many a 
scrimmage he had in Chicago. 
When he went there so boldly, his young wife to win. 
Boss Sheppard then ran in to stop all the fighting; 
Mrs. Marsh, she threatened to blow on them all. 
She seid she'd report them to the Smelling Committee! 
Alid that put an end to the Washington Ball.

Courting Cards.— This Series of Cards has been arranged 
'to meet a 
want fiequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too diffi. 
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unlady-like encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are speut as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. This pack of Cerds will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of qi.estions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The, sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players. 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties  ...... Price 25 Cents.
