dDear Bill,
 
I don't know just where you are right now and I don't know where
 
you're going either, but I wi ltzshmotztkisxaxrmwxixlmxtkxxxixxim want to
 
tell you how how proud and pleased I am txtx)rww about where you've been
 
these last years. And you're leaving at what seems from here a very good
 
time; I managed to hang on too l
ong, I think now, getting relatively l
ittle
 
except angry these
 
Nxthe last couple of years and not setting up my the next hit of my
 
l
ife as thoughtfully as I might have. I
t doesn't appear to me you're
 
making e
ither mistake.
 
I
've been thinking back over Ruth
 
Crawford Seeger and the New Deal ea lately, and the brave and effective job
 
she did in insisting to the "classical" "serious music" world that there
 
valuable
 
were other/musical systems a that didn't spring from western Europe. She
 
and that even came from uneducated working-class wN Americans back in the hills.
 
set out to prove it in part, too, though she did get distracted by a small
 
matter of raising four children and taking care of a brilliant husband Vho
 
wanted her to take care of him But she fought a f
ight no one e
lse was
 
taking on exa tiyxÂ±sxk x t
hxc.as cheerfully and bunptiously and she had a
 
real impact.
 
that my period moved all this a bit further but that
 
I
t seems to me that/y ux sv ztakeiza l
lztkixxx you were ble to demonstrate
 
to the world of the arts how all these systems could fit together.
