The Ukrainian families who form the congregation of St. Michael's
 
Ukrainian Orthodox Church trace their history to the turn of the century,
 
economically inspired, exodus from eastern Europe.
 They came to New
 
England, via Canada or United States port of entry, because work was
 
available in the textile mills.  Parishioner Anne Michaluk says that
 
her parents left Ukraine, "to make-money and pick the gold up off the
 
street."  The original Ukrainian church was St. Michael's, but it was
 
Eastern Rite Greek Catholic in affiliation.
 
In Ukraine there are two major faiths, Orthodox and Catholic, and
 
there has been constant conflict over which is the "true" Ukrainian
 
faith.  In refugee camps the Unia Church combined the practices of
 
both Orthodox and Catholic.  The early churches established in the
 
United States often served mixed congregations.  United only by their
 
common homeland, parishioners continuing disagreements sometimes
 
resulted in the establishment of two separate Ukrainian parishes in a
 
single community.  This is the case in Woonsocket, Rhode Island.
 
The congregation of the original, Catholic-affiliated church had
 
a conflict with the Bishop over the appointment of a priest who had not
 
been properly ordained.  A church committee voted to overrule the Bishop
 
and padlocked the church.  The congregation was divided over this issue
 
and a complicated court case ensued.
 Control of the church property,
 
located in Rhode Island, was given to the existing, Catholic congregation.
 
Control of the cemetery, located in nearby Blackstone, Massachusetts,
 
went to the rebellious Orthodox members of the congregation.
 
The Ukrainian Orthodox parishioners held services in various church
 
sites throughout Woonsocket while they raised funds for their own church.
 
In 1938 they purchased the land, house and barn on Harris Avenue for
 
$18,000.  The barn was converted into what is presently an auditorium
 
with a huge kitchen.
 This space served as both sanctuary and the site
 
of fund-raising dinners, dances and bingo games.  Within two years
 
a parish numbering five or six hundred persons had raised enough money
 
to lay the cornerstone of the church.  The mortgage was burned in 1952.
 
Today, St. Michael's Ukrainian Orthodox Church has a congregation of
 
four to five hundred persons and owns the church building, the priest's
 
residence, the auditorium building -
 all insured for a total of three
 
million dollars.  In addition to its operating funds, the church has
 
investments totalling nearly $75,000.
 
On Blackstone Street, one and one half blocks away stands "the other"
 
St. Michael's, still a viable Ukrainian Catholic parish.
 Such a Catholic-
Orthodox split is not unknown in other Ukrainian communities.  For example,
 
Linda Oryhon, the wife of the present priest, did not attend Ukrainian
 
school in her home town of Passaic, New Jersey.  The school was operated
 
by the Ukrainian Catholics and Ukrainian Orthodox children were not welcome.
 
In larger cities, like Chicago and New York, with greater resources and
 
access to teachers and materials, the Ukrainian school exists as an entity
 
entirely separate from the churches.
 Students attend the religious classe
 
of their faith, but join with Ukrainians of both faiths to study their
 
culture, history and language.
 
Ukrainians do not represent a large percentage of the population of
 
the United States.  According to the most recent census there are slightly
 
over half a million Americans who claim Ukrainian descent.
 In Woonsocket,
 
-3-
the Ukrainians are overwhelmed by the dominant French-Canadian population.
 
Rhode Island is a predominantly Roman Catholic state and Woonsocket is
 
a Roman Catholic community.  Natalie Michaluk, teacher of the Kindergarten
 
class at St. Michael's illustrated this with several episodes from her
 
own childhood.
 In elementary school, for example, the children were re-
leased from public school classes one morning each week to attend catechism
 
class.  Natalie was the only child left behind in the classroom.  Her
 
Roman Catholic classmates thought she was lucky, but she remembers feeling
 
very much the lonely outsider.
 
On another occasion, Natalie met a woman who turned out to live in
 
the same neighborhood as the Michaluks.  In amazement, the woman exclaimed,
 
u1 don't remember seeing you in church."  Obviously it never occurred to
 
this woman that a resident of Woonsocket would not attend her local
 
Roman Catholic church.
 
Within this context, the Ukrainian Orthodox congregation tried to
 
educate their children -
 to teach them about their religion and the
 
language and culture of their ancestry.  Anne Michaluk, a parishioner
 
of St. Michael's for forty years says that years ago,  "it was very,
 
very simple, now its become complicated."  One complication is the
 
loss of the Ukrainian language in the home.
 
Mrs. Michaluk and her oldest daughter, Barbara, grew up in bi-
lingual homes.  The Ukrainian school reinforced a spoken language.
 
It added grammar and structure to a language used daily.
 The books
 
and classroom materials were all in Ukrainian and no English was
 
necessary.  Mrs. Michaluk attanded Ukrainian school in Boston where
 
she was taught by the priest and his wife.  This was, and still is,
 
the traditional form of the Ukrainian school, with classes conducted
 
-4--
on weekday afternoons and Sunday morning.  The priest is primarily
 
responsible, and he and his wife are the main teachers.  Parish
 
volunteers may be called in to teach the younger children, if a need
 
exists.  Mrs. Michaluk states, "the Priest would teach the classes
 
unless the group was large enough or had enough money to hire a pro-
fessor."
 
St. Michael's was neither large enough nor rich enough, but in 1950
 
they did acquire the services of a professor.  Trofim Pasichnyk was a
 
60 year old Czechoslovakian
 college professor with decidedly anti-
Communist political feelings.  When his writings and outspoken lectures
 
became dangerous, the underground spirited him out of Europe by way of
 
England.  He came to Woonsocket because of its isolation.  According
 
to everyone with whom we spoke, he lived in fear; he truly believed
 
that the Communists would find him and eliminate him.  Father Halleck,
 
then pastor of St. Michael's, provided a bachelor apartment at the rear
 
of the Parish House.  Mr. Pasichnyk became "the Professor" and that is
 
how he is remembered.  He taught Ukrainian language and culture to thirty-
eight children from first grade through high school.  He conducted
 
classes in reading and writing the Ukrainian language for interested
 
adult members of the congregation.  He directed the choir and the
 
Bandura Male Chorus.  In his free time, he wrote poetry and played the
 
violin.  The Professor remained at St. Michael's for eighteen years,
 
through five different priests.  He retired to a friend's home and died
 
of old age soon after his retirement.  After his death there was a
 
period of a few years where no Ukrainian school was conducted.  The priest
 
continued to offer religious classes but that was all.
 
The parish then acquired a new priest, Father Kovaleneko.  He and
 
-5-
his wife were recent immigrants to the United States and he, himself,
 
participated only marginally in the religious education program.  Mrs.
 
Kovalencko began teaching Ukrainian language and culture classes to
 
the children as they reached the age of ten.  The younger children were
 
taught by Janice Meschiesen,
 later by Natalie Michaluk.  Both Natalie
 
and the children currently in the high school class remember "Mrs. K"
 
as a woman of the old world.
 She spoke heavily accented English and
 
did not interact well with the children.
 They, in turn, barely tolerated
 
the classes.
 She used to use a timer to let her know when the class
 
time was up.
 The children would push the time ahead when her back was
 
turned.  If she gave them a few minutes break in mid-session, they
 
would hide outside in the bushes, forcing her into a time-consuming
 
search for her pupils.
 
Despite these antics, all of the individuals interviewed reported
 
that she did teach them the Ukrainian alphabet and how to read aloud
 
in Ukrainian.
 They did not enjoy the teacher or her classroom techniques
 
but they did learn the material.  They had regular homework assignments
 
which they usually completed under pressure from their parents.  Natalie
 
recalls learning a recitation for a Christmas program but never knowing
 
what it was that she was  reciting.
 
In the late 1970's, the church leadership became aware that this
 
parish had a sizeable number of younger members whose needs were not
 
being met.  The President, Mr. Chaharyn, went to South Bound Brook,
 
New Jersey to consult with the Metropolitan, spiritual leader of the
 
church, about a new priest for
, the parish.  The Metropolitan was re-
luctant to assign a young priest (
from a limited supply) to such a
 
small church in what he considered an isolated area.  He preferred to
 
-
6-
send them to the larger urban areas and to assign the older priests
 
or even those in semi-retirement to the less active parishes.  Mr.
 
Chaharyn says that he was forced to threaten to take the church out of
 
the diocese and seek a new priest in Canada.
 Father Myron Oryhon,
 
a newly ordained seminarian, and his wife, Linda, came to Woonsocket for
 
a visit.  The decision to affiliate was mutual and in 1979 Father Myron
 
became the priest of St. Michael's Ukrainian Orthodox Church.  In
 
addition to his duties as the priest, Father Myron and Pa i (mother)
 
Linda had to evaluate and revamp the religious and cultural education
 
offered to the church's young people
 
Father Myron stresses that this i
s an "old immigration" parish.
 
This means that the children in his church school are second and
 
third generation Americans.  They are the descendants of those who
 
left Ukraine in the early years of this century seeking economic
 
opportunity in the land of milk and honey.  Many of his students come
 
from families in which only one parent is Ukrainian and homes in which
 
Ukrainian is no longer, or never was, spoken.
 From Mrs. Kovalencko
 
the older children learned the Cyrillic alphabet and are able to "read"
 
Ukrainian.  Further questioning, however, revealed that while they are
 
able to properly pronounce the words in Ukrainian, they have no idea
 
what they are reading.  Eric, a student in the fifth and sixth grade
 
class said, "I can read it and write it but I really don't know what
 
anything means."  They cannot speak or understand spoken Ukrainian.
 
In contrast, newer immigration parishes are populated by those who
 
left Ukraine after World War II, usually for political reasons.  In
 
those parishes most households are still bilingual and the children
 
learn Ukrainian history and an ethnic identity through the Ukrainian
 
school.  Major "new immigration" parishes exist in Chicago, New York,
 
and Philadelphia.
 There i
s a sizeable Ukrainian community in Canada,
 
as well.
 
In 1979, when Father Myron, who majored in education for two years,
 
examined the curriculum of the classes taught at St. Michael's, he
 
found that the children did not understand the concept of Orthodoxy
 
nor the growth of the Orthodox faith in Ukraine.  Father Myron decided
 
to try to separate the faith from the culture.  He and his wife, who
 
holds a degree in art education, set up the tentative curriculum so
 
that the younger children would begin to learn about their Orthodox
 
religion.  They would understand the rituals and paraphernalia of their
 
faith, first, and then could begin to examine questions which relate
 
to ethnicity and cultural history.  Father Myron, himself, grew up as
 
an old immigration Ukrainian in a new immigration setting near Chicago.
 
He did not attend Ukrainian school but did take religious instruction.
 
He, himself, can read and write Ukrainian only with difficulty and
 
cannot converse.  He believes that his lack of fluency in the lang. .,
 
is not a problem in the Woonsocket parish, although it would be in
 
other settings.
 
Not all members of the parish agree with Father Myron's evaluation.
 
Several with whom we spoke thought that maintaining the Ukrainian
 
language ought to be a duty of all Americans of Ukrainian descent.  They
 
were somewhat appalled that their priest, the leader of their church and
 
thus, symbolically, their cultural as well as spiritual representative,
 
did not share these feelings.  There is intense feeling about .
the
 
Ukrainian language within the parish.  Much of this feeling is related
 
to anti-Soviet sentiment generated by the belief that the Soviets are
 
eliminating the Ukrainian language and culture.
 Loss of the language,
 
despite recognition that the Ukrainian spoken by immigrants and that
 
used in Ukraine must be idiomatically quite different, represents a
 
loss of Ukrainian identity.
 
Linda Oryhon mentions that she took private lessons in Ukrainian
 
before her marriage because she feared that her lack of fluency might
 
inhibit her ability to properly fill the role of the priest's wife.
 
Parish members have suggested that Father Myron should enroll in an
 
intensive course in conversational Ukrainian offered by Harvard.
 
The teenage and pre-teenaged school children comment on their inability
 
to carry on a conversation in Ukrainian.  When they attend Ukrainian
 
summer camp in Pennsylvania or the dance workshops in New York, they
 
come together with young people from all over the United States and
 
Canada.  Many of these children, particularly the Canadians, come from
 
extremely nationalistic family situations and speak fluent Ukrainian.
 
The contingent from St. Michael's feels a little lost and a little
 
threatened.  As one teenager commented, "I don't know whether they're
 
talking to me or about me."
 
Father Myron believes that, while the language is important, not
 
knowing the language does not make you less important.  He believes
 
that tradition and history can be kept alive without a functional
 
knowledge of Ukrainian.  His older students would like very much to
 
extend their knowledge of the language but he maintains that St.
 
Michael's cannot provide the minimal re uirements for such language
 
study:  a qualified instructor, taDe recordings of spoken Ukrainian,
 
a language lab in which to use those tapes, and most importantly,
 
the reinforcement of repetition through regular use of the language.
 
This is an English speaking parish.
 Even the conversation of the oldest
 
parishioners is full of English words with Ukrainian endings tacked on.
 
One of the ways in which Father Myron encourages the church school
 
participants to feel good about their Ukrainian identity is through
 
membership in the Ukrainian Orthodox League.
 The U.O.L.  is an organization
 
affiliated with the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the U.S.A.  The
 
membership consists of the children of old immigration families who
 
have not kept up the language.
 There are a number of hew immigration
 
organization like Vadum, Plast, and Sum, which are offshoots of
 
Ukrainian political organizations, drawing membership from both Orthodox
 
and Catholic churches.  Like the Boy Scouts, members of these organizations
 
wear uniforms.
 They study Ukrainian language and culture.  According
 
to Father Myron, through the U.O.L., individuals who do not speak
 
Ukrainian can "feel that they also belong to the Ukrainian community."
 
The children from St. Michael's feel uncomfortable, even apprehensive
 
in the company of other Ukrainians who are fluent in the language.
 
They feel that they are not truly Ukrainian or that they are second-
class Ukrainians.  The U.O.L. strives to provide an identity for them
 
through parish activities and regional conferences.
 
The present church school is directed by Father Myron and Pani
 
Linda.  Their primary goal is to provide their students with a fir
 
understanding of their religion.  Many of the children came into tI
.
 
services but did not understand what was going on.  They didn't know
 
about the rituals and their symbolism.  The children must understand
 
their Orthodox faith so that they can participate fully in the service,
 
whether it is conducted in English or Ukrainian.  Ukrainian customs and
 
traditional songs are included in this understanding because they are
 
an integral part of the worship.
 The ever-changing curriculum was
 
designed to provide this basic understanding in the first few years
 
of schooling so that topics relating to the complex Ukrainian history
 
and culture might be added as the children grow older.  Present
 
church school students aged ten and older studied with Mrs. Kovalencko
 
and "read" Ukrainian.  The younger children have had no language
 
training within the church school.  They will learn some Ukrainian as
 
it is used in the liturgy and in traditional prayers.
 Since Father
 
Myron has only been with the parish for three years, the curriculum is
 
still developing in response to his perceptions of church school needs.
 
It should also be noted that the Diocesan Commission on Education has
 
a curriculum but it was regarded as too inflexible by the Oryhons.
 
Classroom materials are purchased by P ni Linda from a number of
 
sources.  She maintains contact with other Orthodox churches in the
 
area, since basic religious concepts are shared, and she has attended
 
church school conferences sponsored by both Antiochan Orthodox and
 
Russian Orthodox (Orthodox Church of America) groups.  The Ukrainian
 
Orthodox Consistory sponsors regional and national conferences for
 
teachers, as well.  Most classroom materials come from the Orthodox
 
Christian Education Commission in Syracuse, New York.
 
In addition to the Oryhons, there are two certified, elementary
 
school teachers on the faculty.  These two women, Janice Meschiesen and
 
Natalie Michaluk, grew up in Woonsocket and studied under "the Professor"
 
and Mrs. Kovalencko.  As a teenager, Janice, who is in her mid-thirties,
 
was Natalie's instructor.  As classroom teachers, they have input into
 
the selections of materials to be used and the direction of classroom
 
information.
 If something doesn't work or if questions arise, Father
 
-12-
commitment to the church.  They are taught by Janice Meschiesen, a
 
certified, elementary school teacher.  Janice grew up in a bilingual
 
home and began teaching Sunday School while she was in high school.
 
Her former pupil, Natalie Michaluk,  is now the teacher to her five
 
year old daughter, Melissa.
 It appears that families within St.
 
Michael's church community remain committed to church life through
 
generations -
 children like Janice go through the church school
 
(
she studied with the "Professor"), teach in the church school, and
 
then bring their own children into the experience.  Priests come and
 
go but the church and its families remain.
 
While she is delighted with Father Myron and believes that he
 
brings discipline and order to the church and the educational process,
 
Janice is disappointed over the absence of Ukrainian classes at the
 
church.  She speaks Ukrainian and her husband understands the language,
 
although he is reluctant to speak.  She feels that retaining the
 
language is an important aspect of maintaining Ukrainian culture.
 
Even the priest's wife, Linda Oryhon, expressed concern that her two
 
year old son learn the language.  She said that she wanted to speak
 
Ukrainian to him but found herself tongue tied.  She expressed a de-
sire to find a Ukrainian School for him some day.
 
First Confession is not the same occasion as First Communion in the
 
Roman Catholic Church.  These children have received communion during
 
the service since Father Myron came to the church in 1979.  He preaches
 
that young children cannot know sin and are, therefore, able to re-
ceive communion.  Preparation for the first confession involves a be-
ginning understanding of church doctrine and continuing reinforcement
 
of the details of the altar and the rituals begun during the kinder-
-13-
garten year.
 Of primary concern on our last visit to this class was
 
the understanding that fasting from midnight until after the confession
 
did not mean they could stay up until midnight.
 In their classes at
 
St. Michael's Ukrainian Orthodox Church there is little to remind these
 
very young children of their Ukrainian heritage.  They are learning
 
about their Orthodox faith and understanding the position of the faith
 
in their ethnic background will come later.
 
Third and fourth grade students are taught by P ni Linda using a
 
text entitled Finding Your Way through the Bible (Mayes, Paul B. and
 
Carolyn, Abingdon Press, 1971).  The intent is to view the Bible on
 
two levels -
 as an historical document and as the basis of the faith.
 
In addition, these children are studying the Ukrainian holidays.
 
They are particularly i
mpressed by their unique (and enviable) oppor-
tunity to celebrate occasions twice, once during the school holiday
 
and again a week later on the Orthodox date.
 In this class homework
 
is assigned and graded, but on the basis of effort, not correctness.
 
One student in the class is Lisa, a fourth grader at St. Cecelia's,
 
a Roman Catholic School in Pawtucket, Rhode Island.  Lisa's mother is
 
Ukrainian, her father is not.  But, her father provides her trans-
portation to religious classes and babysits for the Oryhons.' son so
 
that Pnj Linda is free to teach her class.  Lisa is friendly with
 
the other students in her class but because of distances they do not
 
socialize except at church functions.  She knows no Ukrainian except
 
the names of

Myron.  This group of ten to twelve year olds studied Ukrainian with
 
-14-
Mrs. Kovalencko.
 All of them know the Cyrillic alphabet and can
 
"read and write" Ukrainian.
 That is, they can pronounce the correct
 
sounds to go with the letters that they see or produce the correct
 
letter in a written exercise.
 Only one of them actually understands
 
spoken Ukrainian and many prayers are simply memorized sounds.  They
 
come to religious classes because their parents make them come, but
 
also because they have been coming since they were very small.  The'
 
are vocal in their dislike of situations, such as summer camp, wher
 
they must interact with peer group members who are fluent in Ukrainian.
 
The shared sentiment was that studying Ukrainian was boring!
 
Yet, Eric is the head altar boy and has accepted the responsibility
 
to help train the younger boys with some eagerness.  They seem to be
 
genuinely fond of one another and supportive of the problems of being
 
the only Ukrainians as well as the only Orthodox students in their
 
school situations.  They enjoy activities of their U.O.L. group, such
 
as a recent car wash.  The girls are eager to become full-fledged
 
performing members of the dance group, as they feel that their younger
 
group gets short changed when it comes to performing.  A few of the
 
boys have recently begun to dance but they are not at all sure about
 
their commitment.
 
The textbook for this group is God With Us, published by the
 
Standing Conference of Canonical Orthodox Bishops in the Americas in 1966.
 
In addition, they have workbooks, homework and examinations and receive
 
grades at the end of the year.  Their relationship with Father Myron is
 
a warm one and they like and respect him.' They feel less pressure to
 
do the homework he assigns as compared to their public school work, but
 
the work is done and usually on time.
 
The high school class members also studi ed with �
frs. Yovalencko and
 
also read Ukrainian.  Many of the s
tudents in this class are related
 
t
o e 
.
 
ach other and see each other at family gatherings as well as at
 
religious classes, church, the dance group and U
.O.L. functions.
 
Their textbook, Heroes for Truth: the Orthodox Christian Church through
  
the Ages, Volume 1
, was provided by the Religious Education Department
 
of the Russian Orthodox Church of America.  The classroom studies
 
are directed toward an understanding of the history of orthodoxy and
 
the parallel history of Ukraine.  These students also have workbooks,
 
homework and examinations.  They -seem to do the work, although they
 
do not appear to take i
t as seriously as the s
tudents a f
 ew years
 
younger.  This is the age, Father Myron pointed out, at which most
 
s
top attending religious school.  Natalie Michaluk, too, mentioned
 
that during high school most students have many other commitments and
 
religious school usually fades in importance.  With an eye toward
 
keeping them actively involved in church life, Father Myron has arranged
 
for this group to become a church chorus.  They will study with an
 
instructor from Boston who will teach them songs in Ukrainian.  Along
 
with the songs they will receive subtle instruction in Ukrainian
 
history and traditional life.  The songs may also increase their
 
Ukrainian vocabularies.
 
Only one member of this class, Candace Gemski, comes from a home
 
in which Ukrainian is spoken.  She understands enough so that her
 
parents cannot keep secrets from her by speaking in Ukrainian.  Her
 
grandparents encourage her to use the language.  These students ex-
pressed frustration over their inability to speak and understand
 
Ukrainian, again, particularly in situations where they were outsiders
 
-16-
in a group of Ukrainian-speaking teenagers.  They would, for the
 
most part, like to learn the language but do not perceive any
 
opportunities to do so.
 
All of the students in the high school class are members of the
 
Odessa Ukrainian Dancers, directed by Thomas Chaharyn and Natalie
 
Michaluk.  The dance group is affiliated with the church; weekly
 
rehearsals are held in the church auditorium, performances raise
 
funds for church activities.  This dance group was begun in 1976
 
by Mr. Chaharyn who has been teaching Ukrainian dancing for fifty
 
years.  At age 68, he is no longer physically able to participate
 
as fully in the rehearsals as he would like, so he recruited Natalie
 
to assist.  Eventually, Natalie assumed major responsibility for
 
the group's organization, rehearsals and bookings.  They rehearse
 
once a week for one and one half to two hours.  The dancers and
 
their families accept this responsibility; absence from rehearsal
 
for frivolous reasons is almost unknown.
 On the other hand, each
 
of the children is involved in numerous school and sports activities
 
which cause scheduling problems.
 The dancers are escorted to rehearsals
 
by a parent or relative who then remains as an observer.
 For those
 
who travel some distance to the church, the commitment involves a full
 
evening.
 
Paula Hreczuck is Mr. Chaharyn's daughter and both of her teenage
 
children, Julia and Michael, as well as a number of nieces and her
 
nephew, Mark, are dancers.  She was a dancer, herself, in one of her
 
father's earlier troupes.  Paula's children do not attend religious
 
classes at St. Michael's although their parents do attend services.
 
Mrs. Hreczuck cited time and distance as the reasons why the children
 
did not attend the one hour religious class held immediately before
 
dancers from St. Michael's at a disadvantage.
 The cost of attending
 
the workshop is raised by the dancers during the preceding year and
 
supplemented,  if necessary, by their parents.  At Soyuzivka, one may
 
participate in any number of workshops including those in Ukrainian
 
language and culture.
 
The Odessa Ukrainian Dancers do not stress the regional identification
 
of their dances, except those from the Carpathian Mountains.
 In per-
formance, each dance is introduced, by Natalie, with a brief explanation
 
of its geographic and social context.  The younger dancers are taught
 
basic steps by Mr. Chaharyn.  When they are proficient in these, Natalie
 
begins their instruction in basic choreography.  As needed, they are
 
then integrated into the performing troupe.
 The pre-teenage girls
 
cannot wait to become performers, but the boys, as previously stated,
 
are less enthusiastic.  They think dancing is for sissies, although they
 
hear from the two male dancers, Mark and Michael, the amount of physical
 
strength and agility that is necessary.
 
Dancers usually remain with the group until they graduate from high
 
school.  Some former dancers, now in college, still perform with the
 
troupe occasionally, but for the most part college, marriage and other
 
commitments end the affiliation.
 
Our relationship with St. Michael's Ukrainian Orthodox Church, as
 
with any intensive fieldwork effort, had its moments of exhilaration
 
and some times of total depression.  Our study revealed that the
 
present church school places far more emphasis on the Orthodox faith
 
and far less on the Ukrainian identity-than we had been led to expect.
 
Father Myron, Pii Linda. the Mich luk , and all of the students in
 
the church school impressed us with their warmth, their o"enness, and

ST.  MICHAEL'
 UKRAINIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH SCHOOL
 
Woonsocket,  Rhode Island
 
Final Report by Carole 0. Bell and Mary—Louise Haas
 
The Ukrainian families who form the congregation of  St. Michael'
 
Ukrainian Orthodox church link their arrival in the United States wit
 
the economically-inspired exodus from Eastern Europe that took place
 
at the turn of  the  century. They settled in New England because work
 
was available in the textile mills.  Parishioner Anne Michaluk says th
 
her parents  left  the Ukraine,  "to make money and pick the gold up off
 
the street."
 I 
The original Ukranian church in Woonsocket,  Rhode Island was  St.
 
Michael's,  an Eastern Rite Greek Catholic  church.  In the Ukraine there
 
are two major  faiths: O rthodox Catholic and Catholic. There has been
 
constant  conflict over the years  regarding which is the "true"
 
Ukrainian faith.  The early churches established in the United States
 
often served mixed congregations. United only by their common homeland,
 
continuing disagreements on the parishioners' part sometimes resulte�,,
 
in the establishment of two separate Ukrainian parishes  in a single
 
community.  That is  the case in Woonsocket.
 
The congregation of the original, Catholic-affiliated church in
 
Woonsocket had a conflict with the bishop over the appointment of a
 
priest who had not been properly ordained. A church committee voted  to
 
overrule the bishop and padlocked the church.  The congregation was
 
divided over  the  issue. A complicated court case ensued.  Eventually,
 
control of  the church property,  located in Rhode Island, was given to
 
2
 
the existing Catholic congregation, and control of the cemetery,
 
located in nearby Blackstone, Massachusetts, went to the rebellious
 
Orthodox members of t
he congregation.
 
The Orthodox parishioners,  left with a cemetery and no church,
 
held services in various church sites throughout Woonsocket while they
 
raised funds for their own church. In 1
938 they purchased land, a
 
house, and a barn on Harris Avenue for $
18,000. The barn was converted
 
into what is now an auditorium with a huge kitchen. This space served
 
as b
oth a sanctuary and gathering place for fund-raising dinners,
 
dances, and bingo games. Within two years a parish numbering f
ive or
 
six hundred persons had raised enough money to lay the cornerstone of
 
the church. The mortgage was burned i
n 1
952.
 
Today,  St. Michael's Ukrainian Orthodox Church has a congr
ri
 
of four to five hundred persons and owns the church building,  t
he
 
priest's residence  and the auditorium building--all insured for a
 
total of $3 million. In addition to its operating funds, the church has
 
investments totaling nearly $75,000.
 
On Blackstone S
treet, one and a half blocks away, stands "the
 
other" S
t. Michael's, still a viable Ukrainian Catholic parish. Such a
 
split is not unknown in other Ukrainian communities. For example, Linda
 
Oryhon,  the wife of the present priest at St. Michael's, did not attend
 
Ukrainian school in her home town of Passaic, New Jersey. The school
 
was operated by the Ukrainian Catholics and Ukrainian Orthodox childrer
 
were not welcome. In larger cities,  like Chicago and New York, with
 
3
 
greater resources and access to t
eachers and materials, the Ukrainian
 
school exists as an entity entirely separate from the churches.
 
Students attend the religious classes of their faith, but join with
 
Ukrainians of both faiths to study their culture, history, and
 
language.
 
Ukrainians do not r
epresent a l
arge percentage o
f the population
 
o
f the United States. According t
o the most recent census, there are
 
slightly over 500,000 Americans who claim Ukrainian descent. In
 
Woonsocket the Ukrainians are outnumbered by the dominant
 
French-Canadian population.
 
Rhode Island i
s a predominantly Roman Catholic state and
 
Woonsocket is a Roman Catholic community. Natalie Michaluk, the
 
kindergarten teacher at St. Michael's, illustrated this with several
 
episodes from her own childhood. In elementary school, for example,  the
 
children were released from public school classes one morning each
 
week t
o attend catechism class. Natalie was the only child left behind
 
in the classroom. Her Roman Catholic classmates thought she was lucky,
 
but she remembers feeling very much the lonely outsider. On another
 
occasion Natalie met a woman who turned out to l
ive in the same
 
neighborhood as the Michaluks. The woman exclaimed in amazement,  "
I
 
don't r
emember seeing you in church." I
t never occurred to the woman
 
that a resident of Woonsocket would not attend her local Roman Catholic
 
church!
 
4
 
Within this context the Orthodox Ukrainian congregation t
ried to
 
educate its children —to teach them about their religion and the
 
l
anguage and culture of their ancestry. Anne Michaluk, a parishioner
 
of S
t. Michael's for forty years, says that years ago, "it was very,
 
v
ery s
imple,  and now i
t's b
ecome complicated." One complication i
s the
 
loss o
f the Ukrainian l
anguage in the home.
 
Mrs. Michaluk grew up in a bilingual home. The Ukrainian school
 
reinforced the spoken language, adding grammar and structure t
o a
 
l
anguage used daily. The books and classroom materials were a
ll in
 
Ukrainian and no English was necessary. Mrs. Michaluk attended
 
Ukrainian school in Boston, where she was taught by the priest and his
 
wife. This was,  and s
till is, the traditional form of the Ukrainian
 
school--classes are conducted on weekday afternoons and Sunday
 
mornings, and the priest and his wife are the main teachers. Parish
 
v
olunteers may be called in to teach the younger children, if a need
 
exists. As Mrs. Michaluk recalls, "the priest would teach the classes,
 
unless the group was large enough or had enough money to hire a
 
professor."
 
S
t. Michael's was neither large enough nor rich enough, but in
 
1
950 they did acquire the services of a professor--Trofim Pasichnyk, a
 
60 -year--old Czechoslovakian college professor with decidedly
 
anti-Communist political feelings. When his writings and outspoken
 
lectures became dangerous in his home country,  the underground spirited
 
h
im out o
f Europe by way of England. He was attracted to Woonsocket
 
I
 
5
 
because of its isolation. According to everyone with whom we spoke, he
 
l
ived in fear; he truly believed that the Communists would f
ind him and
 
eliminate him.
 
Father Halleck, then the pastor of St. Michael's, provided a
 
bachelor apartment at the rear of the Parish House. Mr. Pasichnyk
 
became "the Professor" and is still remembered in those terms. He
 
taught Ukrainian language and culture to thirty-eight children from
 
first grade through high school. He conducted classes in reading and
 
writing the Ukrainian language for interested adult members of the
 
congregation. He also directed the choir and Bandura Male Chorus.  In
 
his free t
ime he wrote poetry and played the violin.
 
The Professor remained at St. Michael's for eighteen years,
 
through the tenure of five different priests. He then retired t
o a
 
friend's home, dying of old age shortly after his retirement. After his
 
death there was a period of a few years during which no Ukrainian
 
school was conducted; the priest continued to offer religious classes,
 
but that was all.
 
The parish then acquired a new priest, Father Kovalencko. He and
 
his wife were recent immigrants to the United States. Father Kovalenr
 
participated only marginally in the religious-education program. Mrs.
 
Kovalencko began teaching Ukrainian language and culture classes to the
 
children as they reached the age of ten. The younger children were
 
taught by Janis Meschiesen, and later by Natalie Michaluk. Both Natalie
 
and the children currently in the high school class remember  Mrs. K
 
a
s a woman o
f the old world. She spoke heavily accented English and did
 
not interact well with the children. They, in turn, barely t
olerated
 
t
he c
lasses. She used a t
imer to l
et her know when the class was up.
 
-
The children would push the t
ime ahead when her back was turned. I

Despite these antics,  all of the individuals interviewed reported
 
that she did teach them the Ukrainian alphabet and how to read aloud in
 
Ukrainian. They did not enjoy the teacher or her classroom techniques,
 
but they did learn the material.  They had regular homework assignments,
 
which they usually completed under pressure from their parents.  Natalie
 
recalls learning a recitation for a Christmas  program,  but never
 
knowing what it was she was reciting.
 
7
 
decision to affiliate was mutual; in 1
979 Father Oryhon became the
 
priest of St. Michael's Ukrainian Orthodox Church. In addition to his
 
duties as the priest, Father Myron, as the parishioners call him,
 
and Pan! (mother) Linda had to evaluate and revamp the religious and
 
cultural education offered to the church's young people.
 
Father Myron stresses that his i
s an "old immigration" parish.
 
That means that the children in his church school are second- and
 
third-generation Americans, the descendants of those who left the
 
Ukraine in the early years of this century seeking economic
 
opportunity. Many of his students come from families in which only one
 
parent i
s Ukrainian and homes in which Ukrainian is no longer, or n
r
 
was, spoken. Older children in the school learned the Cyrillic alphabet
 
from Mrs. Kovalencko and are able to "read" Ukrainian. Further
 
questioning revealed, however, that while they are able to pronounce
 
the words in Ukrainian properly, they have no idea what they are
 
reading. Eric, a student in the fifth and sixth grade class, says,  .
I
 
can read it and write it, but I really don't know what anything means."
 
They cannot speak or understand spoken Ukrainian either.
 
In contrast, newer immigration parishes are populated by those who
 
left the Ukraine after World War II, usually for political reasons. In
 
those parishes most households are still bilingual. The children learn
 
Ukrainian history and develop a sense of ethnic identity through the
 
Ukrainian school. Major "new immigration" parishes exist in Chicago,
 
New York, and Philadelphia. There is a sizeable Ukrainian community in
 
Canada, as well.
 
When Father Myron, who majored in education for two years,
 
examined the curriculum o
f the classes taught at S
t. Michael's i
n 1
979,
 
he found that the children did not understand the concept o
f Orthodoxy,
 
nor did they know about t
he growth o
f the Orthodox faith in t
he
 
Ukraine. Father Myron decided t
o t
ry t
o separate the faith from the
 
culture. He and his wife, who holds a d
egree i
n art education, s
et up
 
a tentative curriculum designed so that younger children would begin
 
l
earn about their Orthodox r
eligion. The new
.curriculum meant that
 
students would b
e introduced t
o the rituals and paraphernalia o
f their
 
faith f
irst, and later would begin t
o examine questions relating t
o
 
ethnicity and cultural history.
 
Father Myron grew up as an old -immigration Ukrainian in a
 
new-immigration setting near Chicago. He did not attend Ukrainian
 
school, but did
; take religious instruction. He can read and write
 
Ukrainian only with difficulty, and cannot converse. He feels that his

anti-Soviet sentiment generated by the belief that the Soviets are
 
eliminating the Ukrainian language and culture. Loss of the language,
 
despite recognition that the Ukrainian spoken by immigrants and that
 
used in the Ukraine must be idiomatically quite different, represents a
 
loss of Ukrainian identity to many parishioners. Linda Oryhon mentions
 
that she took private lessons in Ukrainian before her marriage because
 
she feared that her lack of fluency might inhibit her ability to fill
 
the role of the priest's wife properly. Parish members have suggested
 
that Father Myron should enroll in an intensive course in
 
conversational Ukrainian offered by Harvard.
 
The t
eenage and pre -t
eenage school children comment on their
 
inability to carry on a conversation in Ukrainian. When they attend
 
Ukrainian summer camp in Pennsylvania, or the dance workshops in New
 
York, they gather with young people from all over the United States and
 
Canada. Many of the children, particularly the Canadians, come from
 
extremely nationalistic family situations and speak fluent Ukrainian.
 
The contingent from St. Michael's feels a little lost and threatened.
 
As one teenager commented,  "
I don't know whether they're talking to me
 
or about me."
 
Father Myron believes that, while the language is important, not
 
knowing the language does not make you less important. He believe
 
that tradition and history can be kept alive without a functional
 
knowledge of Ukrainian. His older students would l
ike very much
 
extend their knowledge of the language, but he maintains that S
t.
 
Michael's cannot provide the minimal requirements for such language

study: a qualified instructor, tape recordings of spoken Ukrainian, a
 
language lab in which to use those tapes, and, most importantly, the
 
r
einforcement of regular use of the language. St. Michael's i
s an
 
English-speaking parish. Even the conversation of the oldest
 
parishioners i
s full of English words with Ukrainian endings t
acked on.
 
One of the ways in which Father Myron encourages the church school
 
participants to feel good about their Ukrainian identity is through
 
membership in the Ukrainian Orthodox League (UOL), an organization
 
affiliated with the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the United States of
 
America. The membership of the UOL consists of the children of
 
old-immigration families who have not kept up the language. According
 
t
o Father Myron, through the UOL Individuals who do not speak Ukrainian
 
can "
feel that they also belong to the Ukrainian community." The
 
children from St. Michael's feel uncomfortable, even apprehensive, in
 
the company of other Ukrainians who are fluent in the language. They
 
feel that they are not truly Ukrainian, or that they are second-class
 
Ukrainians. The UOL strives to provide an identity for them through
 
parish activities and regional conferences.
 
There are also a number of new-immigration organizations, l
ike
 
Vadum, Plast, and Sum, which are offshoots of Ukrainian political
 
or ganizations , drawing membership from both Orthodox and Catholic
 
churches. Like the Boy Scouts, members of these organizations w
'o
 
uniforms. They also study Ukrainian language and culture,

The p
re
-se"  church school is d
irected by Father Myron and Paul
 
Linda. Their primary goal is to provide their students with a firm
 
understanding of their religion. Previously many of the children went
 
t
o the services but did not understand what was going on; they did not
 
know about the r
ituals and their symbolism. In Father Myron's v
iew the
 
children must understand their Orthodox faith so that they can
 
participate fully in the service, whether it is conducted in English or
 
Ukrainian. Ukrainian Customs and traditional songs are part of what
 
should be understood, because they are an integral part of the
 
worship.The constantly changing curriculum was designed to provide a
 
basic understanding of the religion in the first few years of
 
schooling, so that topics relating t
o the complex Ukrainian history and
 
culture can b
e added a
s the children grow older.
 
Present church-school students aged ten and older studied with
 
Mrs. Kovalencko and "read" Ukrainian. The younger children have had no
 
language training within the church school. They will learn some
 
Ukrainian as it is used in the liturgy and in traditional prayers.
 
Since Father Myron has only been with the parish for three years, the
 
curriculum is still developing in response to his perceptions of
 
church-school needs. It should also be noted that the Diocesan
 
Commission of Education has a curriculum,  but i
t is regarded as t
oo
 
inflexible by the Oryhons.

sources. She maintains contact with other Orthodox churches in the
 
area, since basic religious concepts are shared. She has also attended
 
12
 
church-school conferences sponsored by both Antiochan Orthodox and
 
Russian Orthodox (Orthodox Church of America) groups. The Ukrainian
 
Orthodox Consistory sponsors regional and national conferences for
 
teachers, as well. Most classroom materials come from the Orthodox
 
Christian Education Commission in Syracuse, New York.
 
In addition t
o the Oryhons,  there are two certified
 
elementary-school teachers on the faculty. Both of them--Janice
 
Meschiesen and Natalie Michaluk-
.-grew up in Woonsocket and studied
 
under the Professor and Mrs. Kovalencko. Janice, who is in her
 
mid - thirties, was once Natalie's instructor. They b

)
 
the selection of material to be used and the directi
 
take. If something does not work, or if questions arise, Father Myru
 
is the final arbiter. The curriculum is still being developed. The
 
choice of textbooks and supplementary classroom materials is always
 
open to change as newer items become available. There is no cost for
 
the students —all classroom materials are provided by the church.
 
The students are grouped by age. The youngest class is the
 
nursery, with students aged three and four. Mary Ann Gritchenko, the
 
mother of one of the children, and high school student Margaret
 
Zelechevsky teach the nursery. The nursery children are really too
 
Young to understand the meaning of the rituals; nonetheless, they have
 
discussions about God and learn the names of certain objects, such as
 
icons and censers. They participate in the Sunday morning service and
 
may receive communion.

Natalie Michaluk teaches the kindergarten class and directs the
 
dance group. Natalie, a kindergarten teacher by profession, has a
 
classroom demeanor that is patience personified. She uses Colorforms
 
(plastic stick-otis) to represent the altar in the church and the items,
 
used during the service. The children learn the name of each i
tem and
 
its correct placement in the sanctuary. Small printed pamphlets
 
describe the significance of the particular Sunday in the church
 
calendar and provide hands-on activities, such as illustrating a given
 
situation. There are also coloring book pages that illustrate and
 
explain the numerous icons. There are six children in the class, which
 
begins and ends with a prayer and the traditional crossing o
f oneself
 
from r
ight to left three t
imes.
 
The first confession class consists of first and second grade
 
pupils —those who are ready to comprehend the significance of their
 
commitment to the church. The class is taught by Janice Meschiesen, a
 
certified elementary schoolteacher. Janice grew up
 
and began teaching Sunday school when she was in h
 
former pupil, Natalie Michaluk, is now the teacher of her five-year-old
 
daughter Melissa.
 
It appears that families within St. Michael's church community
 
remain committed to the church life through generations. Children like
 
Janice go through the church school, teach in the church school, and
 
then bring their own children to the experience. Priests come and go,
 
but the church and its families remain.
 
I
 
While she is delighted
 
brings discipline and order
 
Janice is disappointed over
 
1

with Father Myron and believes that he
 
to the church and the educational process,
 
the absence of Ukrainian classes at the
 
church. She speaks Ukrainian and her husband understands the language
 
although he is reluctant to speak. She feels that retaining the
 
language is an important aspect of maintaining Ukrainian culture. Even
 
the priest's wife Linda Oryhon expressed concern that her two-year--old
 
son learn the language. She said that she wanted to speak Ukrainian to
 
him, but found herself tongue tied, expressing a desire to f
ind a
 
Ukrainian school for him someday.
 
First Confession i
s not the same as First Communion in the Rom .
;
.
 
Catholic Church. Parish children have received communion during the
 
service ever since Father Myron came to the church in 1
979. He preaches
 
that young children cannot know sin and are able to receive communion
 
therefore. Preparation for First Confession involves learning church
 
doctrine and becoming ever more familiar with the details of the altar
 
and the rituals, a familiarity begun during kindergarten. During our
 
last visit to this class one of the primary points made for the
 
children was that fasting from midnight until after the confession did
 
not mean that they could stay up until midnight. There is little to
 
remind the very young children of their Ukrainian heritage in their
 
first classes at the church school. They are learning about their
 
rthodox faith;  understanding the position of the faith in their ethnic
 
background will come later.

Third and fourth grade students are taught by Pani Linda, using
 
the text Finding Your Way through the Bible.l The book discusses the
 
Bible on two levels —as a historical document and as the basis of the
 
faith. The children also study the Ukrainian holidays. They are
 
particularly impressed by their unique (and enviable) opportunity to
 
celebrate occasions twice, once during the school holiday and again a
 
week later on the Orthodox date. In this class homework i
s assigned and
 
graded, on the basis of effort, not correctness.
 
One student in Pani Linda's class, Lisa, i
s a fourth grader at St.
 
Cecelia's, a Roman Catholic School in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. Her
 
mother is Ukrainian, her father is not. Her father takes her to
 
religious classes and babysits for the Oryhons' son so that Pani Linda
 
is free to teach the class. Lisa is friendly with the other students in
 
her class, but, because of the distances, they do not socialize except
 
at church functions. She knows no Ukrainian except the names of items
 
used during the service and some prayers, learned phonetically.
 
The students in the fifth and sixth grades are taught by Father
 
Myron. This group of ten- to twelve-year-olds studied Ukrainian with
 
Mrs. Kovalencko. All of them know the Cyrillic alphabet and can "read
 
and write" Ukrainian. That is, they can pronounce the correct sounds to
 
go with the letters that they see, or produce the correct letter in a
 
written exercise. Only one of them actually understands spoken
 
Ukrainian.

Students in Father Myron's class attend the classes because their
 
parents make them, but also because they have been going to the school
 
since they were small. They are vocal in their dislike of situations,
 
such a
s summer camp, in which they must interact with  members of their
 
peer group who are fluent in Ukrainian. The shared sentiment among them
 
i
s that s
tudying Ukrainian i
s boring!
 
On the other hand, the students seem t
o be genuinely fond of one
 
another and supportive of the problems of being the only Ukrainians as
 
well a
s the only Orthodox s
tudents in their school situations. They
 
enjoy the activities of their UOL group, such as a recent car wash. The
 
girls are eager to become full—fledged performing members of the dance
 
group, since they feel that their group gets short changed when it
 
comes to performing. A few of the boys have recently begun to dance
 
too, but they are not at all sure about their commitment.
 
The textbook for Father Myron's fifth and sixth grades is God with
 
Us, published in 1
966 by the Standing Conference of Canonical Orth odox
 
Bishops in the Americas. They also have workbooks, homework, and
 
examinations, receiving grades at the end of the year. Their
 
relationship with Father Myron is a warm one; they like and respect
 
him. They feel less pressure to do the homework he assigns, compared to
 
their public—school work, but the work is done and usually on time.

Members of the high school class studied with Mrs. Kovalencko too
 
and also read Ukrainian. Many of the students in the class are related
 
to each other and see each other at family gatherings, as well as at
 
religious classes, church, the dance group, and UOL functions. Their
 
textbook, Heroes for Truth; The Orthodox Christian Church through the  
Ages, Volume 1
, was provided by the Religious Education Department of
 
the Russian Orthodox Church of America. The classroom studies are
 
directed towards understanding the history of Orthodoxy and the
 
parallel history of the Ukraine. These students also have workbooks,
 
homework, and examinations. They seem to do the work, although they do
 
not appear to take it as seriously as the students a few years younger.
 
This is the age, Father Myron pointed out, at which most stop attending
 
religious school. Natalie Michaluk also mentioned that during high
 
school most students have many other commitments, and religious school
 
usually fades in importance. With an eye towards keeping them actively
 
involved in church life, Father Myron has arranged for this group to
 
become a church chorus. They will study with an instructor from Boston
 
who will teach them songs in Ukrainian. Along with the songs, they will
 
receive subtle instruction in Ukrainian history and traditional life.
 
The songs may also increase their Ukrainian vocabularies.
 
Only one member
 
from a home in which Ukrainian is spoken. She understands enough so
 
that her parents cannot keep secrets from her by speaking the language.
 
Her grandparents encourage her to use Ukrainian. The high school
 
students expressed frustration over their inability to speak and
 
understand Ukrainian, particularly in situations in which they were
 
IV
 
outsiders in a group of Ukrainian- speaking teenagers. They would, for
 
the most part,  like to learn the language, but do not perceive any
 
opportunities of doing so.
 
All of  the students in the high school class are members of the
 
Odessa Ukrainian Dancers, directed by Thomas Chaharyn and Natalie
 
Michaluk.  The dance group is affiliated with the church; weekly
 
rehearsals are held in the church auditorium;  their performances raise
 
funds for church activities.  This dance groups was begun in 1976 by Mr.
 
Chaharyn, who has been teaching Ukrainian dancing for fifty years. At
 
age 68 he is no longer physically able to participate as  fully in the
 
rehearsals as he would like,  so he recruited Natalie to assist him.
 
Natalie has since assumed major responsibility for the group's
 
organization,  rehearsals,  and bookings.

Both of  the  teenage children of Paula Hreczuck, Mr. Chaharyn's
 
daughter, are dancers,  along with a number of her nieces and her
 
nephew. Mrs.  Hreczuck was a dancer herself in one of her father's
 
1
9
 
earlier troupes. Her children do not attend r
eligious classes at St.
 
Michael's, although their parents do attend services. Mrs. Hreczuck
 
cited time and distance as the reasons why the children do not attend
 
the one-hour religious class held immediately before the rehearsal.
 
Initially, her children began the dancing to please their grandfathe r
;
 
now they are  committed to  it.  As P i1a exri

ethnic identity.'
 
Margaret Zelechevsky's mother Anne stressed that her husband was
 
the son of a priest and a dancer from the age of six. Margaret is one
 
of the most talented of the female performers, and her family is very
 
involved in church activities. Since they live some distance from the
 
church, they do not interact with the families of the other dancers at
 
church-sponsored activities.
 
The dancers' costumes are handsewn copies of costumes brought to
 
this country by the family of Natalie's mother. They are paid for by
 
the families and the dancers own them. New dancers joining the troupe
 
have to make the costume or have  i
t made for them. The red leather
 
boots are ordered from Canada at a cost of $
100 per pair. Some dancers
 
buy their own boots, while others use and hand down pairs purchased by
 
the group.
 
Dancers attend a two-week workshop at Soyuzivka, the Ukrainian
 
National Association resort in the Catskill Mountains at Kershonksen,
 
New York in the summer. The resort is known affectionately as  Suzie
 
0  among the parishioners of St. Michael's. The workshop is conducted
 
by Peter Malenchuk, a professionalibincer from Canada, who tours with
 
three professional companies. Dancers come from all over the United
 
States and Canada to learn and to share their skills and
 
accomplishments. Everyone is extremely enthusiastic about the workshops
 
and the learning that goes on there. The only negative point once again
 
i
s the fact that many of the dancers are fluent in Ukrainian and speak
 
the language exclusively throughout their time at the resort, leaving
 
the dancers from St. Michael's at a disadvantage-The cost of attending
 
the workshop is raised by the dancers during the preceding year and
 
supplemented, if necessary, by their parents. At Soyuzivka one may
 
participate in a number of workshops, including those in Ukrainian
 
language and culture.
 
The Odessa Ukrainian Dancers do not stress the regional
 
identification of their dances, except those from the Carpathian
 
Mountains. In performance each dance is introduced by Natalie with a
 
brief explanation of its geographic and social context. The younger
 
dancers are taught basic steps by Mr. Chaharyn. When they are
 
proficient in those steps, Natalie begins their instruction in basic
 
choreography. They are then integrated into the performing troupe as
 
needed. The pre-teenage girls cannot wait to become performers, but the
 
boys, as previously noted, are less enthusiastic. They think that
 
dancing is for sissies, although they hear from the two male dancers,
 
Mark and Michael, about the amount of physical strength and agility
 
that is necessary.
 
Dancers usually rem ain with the group until they graduate from
 
high school. Some former dancers, now in college, still perform with
 
the troupe occasionally. For the most part, however, marriage and other
 
commitments end the affiliation with the group.
 
Our relationship with St. Michael's Ukrainian Orthodox Church, as
 
with any intensive fieldwork effort, had its moments of exhilaration
 
and a
-me times of total depression. Our study revealed that the present
 
church school places far more emphasis on the Orthodox faith and far
 
less on the Ukrainian identity than we had been led to expect. Father
 
Myron, Patti Linda, the Michaluks, and all the students in the church
 
school impressed us with their warmth, openness, and pride in their
 
ethnic heritage.
 
The parishioners of St. Michael's Ukrainian Orthodox Church

Micha.-l's Ukrainian Catholic Church. Each has a church school, each has
 
a dance group, and each believes that it represents the true Ukrainian

The Ukrainian families who form the congregation of S
t. Michael's
 
Ukrainian Orthodox church link their arrival in the United States with
 
the economically-inspired exodus from Eastern Europe that took place

The original Ukranian church in Woonsocket, Rhode Island was St.
 
Michael's,  an Eastern Rite Greek Catholic church. In(A
 �
Ukraine th� -
 
are two major faiths: Orthodox Catholic and Catholic. There has bee.
 
constant conflict over the years regarding which is the "true"
 
Ukrainian faith. The early churches established in the United States
 
often served mixed congregations. United only by their common homeland,
 
continuing disagreements on the parishioners' part sometimes resulted
 
in the establishment of two separate Ukrainian parishes in a single
 
community. That is the case in Woonsocket.
 
The congregation of the original, Catholic-affiliated church in
 
Woonsocket had a conflict with the b
ishop over the appointment of a
 
priest who had not been properly ordained. A church committee voted to
 
overrule the bishop and padlocked the church. The congregation was
 
divided over the issue. A complicated court case ensued. Eventually,
 
control of the church property, located in Rhode I
sland, was given t
o
 
2
 
the existing Catholic congregation, and control of the cemetery,
 
located in nearby Blackstone, Massachusetts, went to the rebellious 5  
Orthodox members of the congregation.
 
The Orthodox parishioners,  left with a cemetery and no church,
 
held services in various church sites throughout Woonsocket while they
 
raised funds for their own church. In 1938 they purchased land, a
 
house, and a barn on Harris Avenue for $18,000. The barn was converted
 
into what is now an auditorium with a huge kitchen. This space served
 
as both a sanctuary and gathering place for fund-raising dinners,
 
dances, and bingo games. Within two years a parish numbering five or
 
six hundred persons had raised enough money to lay the cornerstone of
 
the church. The mortgage was burned in 1952.
 
Today, St. Michael's Ukrainian Orthodox Church has a congregation
 
of four to five hundred persons and owns the church building, the
 
priest's residence, and the auditorium building--all insured for a
 
total of $3 million. In addition to its operating funds,  the church has
 
investments totaling nearly $75,000.
 
On Blackstone S
treet, one and a half blocks away, stands "
the
 
:
i
er" St. Michael's, still a viable Ukrainian Catholic parish. Such a
 
L
it is not unknown in other Ukrainian communities. For example, Linda
 
Oryhon, the wife of the present priest at St. Michael's, did not attend
 
Ukrainian school in her home town of Passaic, New Jersey. The school
 
was operated by the Ukrainian Catholics and Ukrainian Orthodox children
 
were not welcome. In larger cities,  l
ike Chicago and New York, with
 
3
 
greater resources and access to teachers and materials,  the Ukrainian
 
school exists as an entity entirely separate from the churches.
 
Students attend the religious classes of their faith, but join with
 
Ukrainians of both faiths to study their culture, history, and
 
language.
 
Ukrainians do not represent a large percentage of the population
 
of the United States. According to the most recent census, there are
 
slightly over 500,000 Americans who claim Ukrainian descent. In
 
Woonsocket the Ukrainians are outnumbered by the dominant
 
French-Canadian population.
 
Rhode Island is a predominantly Roman Catholic state and
 
Woonsocket is a Roman Catholic community. Natalie Michaluk, the
 
kindergarten teacher at St. Michael's, illustrated this with several
 
episodes from her own childhood. In elementary school, for example, the
 
children were released from public school classes one morning each
 
week to attend catechism class. Natalie was the only child left behind
 
in the classroom. Her Roman Catholic classmates thought she was lucky,
 
but she remembers feeling very much the lonely outsider. On another
 
occasion Natalie met a woman who turned out to live in the same
 
neighborhood as the Michaluks. The woman exclaimed in amazement, "I
 
don't remember seeing you in church." It never occurred to the woman
 
that a resident of Woonsocket would not attend her local Roman Catholic
 
church!

Within this context the 
rthodox Ukrainian'
ongregatjon tried to
 
educate its children —to teach them about their religion and the
 
language and culture of their ancestry. Anne Michaluk, a parishioner
 
of St. Michael's for forty years, says that years ago, "it was very,
 
very simple, and now it's become complicated." One complication i
s the
 
loss of the Ukrainian language in the home.
 
Mrs. Michaluk grew up in a bilingual home. The Ukrainian school
 
reinforced the spoken language, adding grammar and structure to a
 
language used daily. The books and classroom materials were all in
 
Ukrainian and no English was necessary. Mrs. Michaluk attended
 
Ukrainian school in Boston, where she was taught by the priest and his
 
wife. This was, and still is, the traditional form of the Ukrainian
 
school--classes are conducted on weekday afternoons and Sunday
 
mornings, and the priest and his wife are the main teachers. Parish
 
volunteers may be called in to teach the younger children, if a need
 
exists. As Mrs. Michaluk recalls, "the priest would teach the clas r
,
 
unless the group was large enough or had enough money to hire
 
professor."
 
St. Michael's was neither large enough nor rich enough, but in
 
1950 they did acquire the services of a professor —Trofim Pasichnyk, a
 
60 -year-old Czechoslovakian college professor with decidedly
 
anti-Communist political feelings. When his writings and outspoken
 
lectures became dangerous in his home country, the underground spirited
 
him out of Europe by way of England. He was attracted to Woonsocket
 
5
 
because of its isolation. According to everyone with whom we spoke, he
 
lived in fear; he truly believed that the Communists would find him and
 
eliminate him.
 
Father Halleck, then the pastor of St. Michael's, provided a
 
bachelor apartment at the rear of the Parish House. Mr. Pasichnyk
 
became "the Professor" and is still remembered in those terms. He
 
taught Ukrainian language and culture to thirty-eight children from
 
first grade through high school. He conducted classes in reading and
 
writing the Ukrainian language for interested adult members of the
 
congregation. He also directed the choir and Bandura Male Chorus. In
 
his free time he wrote poetry and played the violin.
 
The Professor remained at St. Michael's for eighteen years,
 
through the tenure of five different priests. He then retired to a
 
friend's home, dying of old age shortly after his retirement. After his
 
death there was a period of a few years durin.  w
 
school was conducted; the priest continued to
 r
:
r  ro
 
but that was all.
 
The parish then acquired a new priest, Father Kovalencko. He and
 
his wife were recent immigrants to the United States. Father Kovalencko
 
participated only marginally in the religious-education program. Mrs.
 
Kovalencko began teaching Ukrainian language and culture classes to the
 
children as they reached the age of ten. The younger children were
 
taught by Janis Meschiesen, and later by Natalie Michaluk. Both Natalie
 
and the children currently in the high school class remember "Mrs. K
'
 
6
 
as a woman of the old world. She spoke heavily accented English and did
 
not interact well with the children. They, in turn, barely tolerated
 
the classes. She used a timer to let her know when the class was up.
 
The children would push the time ahead when her back was turned. If she
 
gave them a few minutes break at mid -session, they would hide outside
 
in the bushes,  forcing her into a t
ime-consuming search for her pupils.
 
Despite these antics, all of the individuals interviewed reported
 
that she did teach them the Ukrainian alphabet and how to read aloud in
 
Ukrainian. They did not enjoy the teacher or her classroom techniques,
 
but they did learn the material. They had regular homework assignments,
 
which they usually completed under pressure from their parents. Natalie
 
recalls learning a recitation for a Christmas program, but never
 
knowing what it was she was reciting.
 
In the late 1970s the church leadership became aware that this
 
parish had a sizeable number of younger members whose needs were not

o
  
being met. The presid en t of  
�_ 4 , Mr. Chaharyn, wen
t to Sou th ,
<

Bound Brook, New Jersey to consult with the metropolitan, the spiritual
 
leader of the church. The  
metropolitan was reluctant to assign a young
 
priest (
from a limited supply) to such a small church in what he
 
considered an isolated area; he preferred to send the young priests to
 
the larger urban areas and to assign the older priests, or even those
 
in semi-retirement, to the less-active parishes. Mr. Chaharyn says that
 
he was forced to threaten to take the church out of the diocese and
 
seek a new priest in Canada. Father Myron Oryhon, a newly ordained
 
seminarian, and his wife Linda then came to Woonsocket for a visit. The
 
7
 
decision to affiliate was mutual; in 1
979 Father Oryhon became the
 
priest of St. Michael's Ukrainian Orthodox Church. In addition to his
 
duties as the priest, Father Myron, as the parishioners call him,
 
and Pani (mother) Linda had to evaluate and revamp the religious and
 
cultural education offered to the church's young people.
 
Father Myron stresses that his is an "old immigration" parish.
 
That means that the children in his church school are second- and
 
third-generation Americans, the descendants of those who left
 
Ukraine in the early years of this century seeking economic
 
opportunity. Many of his students come from families in which only one
 
parent is Ukrainian and homes in which Ukrainian is no longer, or never
 
was, spoken. Older children in the school learned the Cyrillic alphabet
 
from Mrs. Kovalencko and are able to "read" Ukrainian. Further
 
questioning revealed, however,  that while they are able to pronounce
 
the words in Ukrainian properly, they have no idea what they are
 
reading. Eric, a student in the fifth and sixth grade class, says,  "I
 
can read it and write it, but I really don't know what anything means."
 
They cannot speak or understand spoken Ukrainian either.
 
In contrast, newer immigration parishes are populated by those who
 
left W
ukraine after World War II, usually for political reasons. In
 
those parishes most households are still bilingual. The children learn
 
Ukrainian history and develop a sense of ethnic identity through the
 
Ukrainian school. Major "new immigration" parishes exist in Chicago,
 
New York, and Philadelphia. There is a sizeable Ukrainian community in
 
Canada, as well.

When Father Myron, who majored in education for two years,
 
examined the curriculum of the classes taught at St. Michael's in 1
979,
 
he found that the children did not understand the concept of Orthodoxy,
 
nor did they know about the growth of the Orthodox faith in
 
Ukraine. Father Myron decided to try to separate the faith from the
 
culture. He and his wife, who holds a degree in art education, set up
 
a tentative curriculum designed so that younger children would begin to
 
learn about their Orthodox religion. The new curriculum meant that
 
students would be introduced to the rituals and paraphernalia of their
 
faith first, and later would begin to examine questions relating to
 
ethnicity and cultural history.
 
Father Myron grew up as an old-immigration Ukrainian in a
 
new-immigration setting near Chicago. He did not attend Ukrainian
 
school, but did take religious instruction. He can read and write
 
Ukrainian only with difficulty, and cannot converse. He feels that his
 
lack of fluency in the language is not a problem in the Woonsocket
 
parish, although it would be in other settings.
 
Not all members of the parish agree with Father Myron's
 
evaluation. Several with whom we spoke thought that maintaining the
 
Ukrainian language ought to be a duty of all Americans of Ukrainian
 
descent. They were somewhat appalled that their priest, the leader of
 
their church and, symbolically, their cultural and spiritual
 
representative, did not share their feelings. There i
s intense f
eeLf
 
about the Ukrainian language within the parish, much of it connected to
 
9
 
anti-Soviet sentiment generated by the belief that the Soviets are
 
eliminating the Ukrainian language and culture. Loss of the language,
 
despite recognition that the Ukrainian spoken by immigrants and that
 
used i
 
Ukraine must be idiomatically quite different, represents a
 
loss of Ukrainian identity to many parishioners. Linda Oryhon mentions
 
that she took private lessons in Ukrainian before her marriage because
 
she feared that her lack of fluency might inhibit her ability to fill
 
the role of the priest's wife properly. Parish members have suggested
 
that Father Myron should enroll in an intensive course in
 
conversational Ukrainian offered by Harvard 
(V i
Fv .
 
The teenage and pre-teenage school children comment on their
 
inability to carry on a conversation in Ukrainian. When they attend
 
Ukrainian summer camp in Pennsylvania, or the dance workshops in New
 
York, they gather with young people from all over the United States and
 
Canada. Many of the children, particularly the Canadians, come from
 
extremely nationalistic family situations and speak fluent Ukrainian.
 
The contingent from St. Michael's feels a little lost and threatened.
 
As one teenager commented,  "I don't know whether they're talking to me
 
or about me."
 
Father Myron believes that, while the language is important, not
 
knowing the language does not make you less important. He believes
 
that tradition and history can be kept alive without a functional
 
knowledge of Ukrainian. His older students would like very much to
 
extend their knowledge of the language, but he maintains that St.
 
Michael's cannot provide the minimal requirements for such language

s
tudy: a qualified instructor, tape recordings of spoken Ukrainian, a
 
language lab in which to use those tapes, and, most importantly, the
 
reinforcement of regular use of the language. St. Michael's is an
 
English-speaking parish. Even the conversation of the oldest
 
parishioners is full of English words with Ukrainian endings tacked on.
 
One of the ways in which Father Myron encourages the church school
 
participants to feel good about their Ukrainian identity is through
 
membership in the Ukrainian Orthodox League (UOL), an organization
 
affiliated with the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the United States of
 
America. The membership of the UOL consists of the children of
 
old-immigration families who have not kept up the language. According
 
to Father Myron, through the UOL 
) individuals who do not speak Ukrainian
 
can "feel that they also belong to the Ukrainian community." The
 
children from St. Michael's feel uncomfortable, even apprehensive, in
 
the company of other Ukrainians who are fluent in the language. They
 
feel that they are not truly Ukrainian, or that they are second-class
 
Ukrainians. The UOL strives to provide an identity for them through
 
parish activities and regional conferences.
 
There are also a number of new-immigration organizations, l
ike
 
Vadum, Plast, and Sum, which are offshoots of Ukrainian political
 
organizations, drawing membership from both Orthodox and Catholic
 
churches. Like the Boy Scouts, members of these organizations wear

The present church school is directed by Father Myron and Pani
 
Linda. Their primary goal is to provide their students with a f
irm
 
understanding of their religion. Previously many of the children went
 
to the services but did not understand what was going on;  they did not
 
know about the rituals and their symbolism. In Father Myron's view the
 
children must understand their Orthodox faith so that they can
 
participate fully in the service, whether it is conducted in English or
 
Ukrainian. Ukrainian customs and traditional songs are part of what
 
should be understood, because they are an integral part of the
 
worship The constantly changing curriculum was designed to provide a
 
basic understanding of the religion in the first few years of
 
schooling, so that topics relating to the complex Ukrainian history and
 
culture can be added as the children grow older.
 
Present church-school students aged ten and older studied with
 
Mrs. Kovalencko and "read" Ukrainian. The younger children have had no
 
language training within the church school. They will learn some
 
Ukrainian as it is used in the liturgy and in traditional prayers.
 
Since Father Myron has only been with the parish for three years
 
curriculum is still developing in response to his perceptions
 
church-school needs. It should also be noted that the Diocesan
 
Commission of Education has a curriculum, but it is regarded as too
 
inflexible by the Oryhons.
 
Classroom materials are purchased by Pani Linda from a number of
 
sources. She maintains contact with other Orthodox churches in the
 
area, since basic religious concepts are shared. She has also attended
 
1
2
 
church-school conferences sponsored by both Antiochan Orthodox and
 
Russian Orthodox (Orthodox Church of America) groups. The Ukrainian
 
Orthodox Consistory sponsors regional and national conferences for
 
teachers, as well. Most classroom materials come from the Orthodox
 
Christian Education Commission in Syracuse, New York.
 
In addition to the Oryhons,  there are two certified
 
elementary-school teachers on the faculty. Both of them--Janice
 
Meschiesen and Natalie Michaluk--grew up in Woonsocket and studied
 
under the Professor and Mrs. Kovalencko. Janice, who is in her
 
mid-thirties, was once Natalie's instructor. They both have input into
 
S
 
the selection of materialAto be used and the direction classes are to
 
take. If something does not work, or if questions arise, Father Myron
 
is the final arbiter. The curriculum is still being developed. The
 
choice of textbooks and supplementary classroom materials is always
 
open to change as newer items become available. There is no cost '

nursery, with students aged three and four. Mary Ann Gritchenko, the
 
mother of one of the children, and high school student Margaret
 
Zelechevsky teach the nursery. The nursery children are really too
 
young to understand the meaning of the rituals; nonetheless, they have
 
discussions about God and learn the names of certain objects, such as
 
icons and censers. They participate in the Sunday morning service and
 
may receive communion.
 
Natalie Michaluk t

While she is delighted with Father Myron and believes that he
 
brings discipline and order to the church and the educational process,
 
Janice is disappointed over the absence of Ukrainian classes at the
 
church. She speaks Ukrainian and her husband understands the language,
 
although he is reluctant to speak. She feels that retaining the
 
language is an important aspect of maintaining Ukrainian culture. Even
 
the priest's wife Linda Oryhon expressed concern that her two-year-old
 
son learn the language. She said that she wanted to speak Ukrainian to
 
him, but found herself tongue tied, expressing a desire to find a
 
Ukrainian school for him someday.
 
First Confession is not the same as First Communion in the Roman
 
Catholic Church. Parish children have received communion during the
 
service ever since Father Myron came to the church in 1
979. He preaches
 
that young children cannot know sin and areAable
 to receive communion
 
thcreforc  Preparation for First Confession involves learning church
 
doctrine and becoming ever more familiar with the details of the altar
 
and the rituals, a familiarity begun during kindergarten. During our
 
last visit to this class one of the primary points made for the
 
-
-
children was that fasting from midnight until after the confession did
 
not mean that they could stay up until midnight. There is little to
 
remind the very young children of their Ukrainian heritage in their
 
first classes at the church school. They are learning about their
 
orthodox faith; understanding the position of the faith in their
 
background will come l
ater.

Third and fourth grade students are taught by Pani Linda, using
 
the text Finding Your Way through the Bible.1 The book discusses the
 
Bible on two levels —as
 
historical document and as the basis of the
 
faith. The children also study the Ukrainian holidays. They are
 
particularly impressed by their unique (and enviable) opj
 
celebrate occasions twice, once during the school holiday
 
week later on the Orthodox date. In this class homework is assigned and
 
graded, on the basis of effort, not correctness.
 
One student in Pani Linda's class, Lisa, is a fourth grader at St.
 
Cecelia's, a Roman Catholic School in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. Her
 
mother i
s Ukrainian, her father is not. Her father takes her to
 
religious classes and babysits for the Oryhons' son so that Paul Linda
 
is free to teach the class. Lisa is friendly with the other students in
 
her class, but, because of the distances, they do not socialize except
 
at church functions. She knows no Ukrainian except the names of items
 
used during the service and some prayers, learned phonetically.
 
The students in the fifth and sixth grades are taught by Father
 
Myron. This group of ten- to twelve-year-olds studied Ukrainian with
 
Mrs. Kovalencko. All of them know the Cyrillic alphabet and can "read
 
and write" Ukrainian. That is, they can pronounce the correct sounds to
 
go with the letters that they see, or produce the correct letter in a
 
written exercise. Only one of them actually understands spoken
 
Ukrainian.
 
1

S
tudents in Father Myron's class attend the classes because their
 
parents make them, but also because they have been going to the sch
 
since they were small. They are vocal in their dislike of situation,
 
such as summer camp, in which they must interact with
 
peer group who are fluent in Ukrainian. The shared Sen
 
i
s that studying Ukrainian is boring!
 
On the other hand, the students seem to be genuinely fond of one
 
another and supportive of the problems of being the only Ukrainians as
 
well as the only Orthodox students in their school situations. They
 
enjoy the activities of their UOL group, such as a recent car wash. The
 
girls are eager to become full—fledged performing members of the dance
 
group, since they feel that their group gets short changed when it
 
comes to performing. A few of the boys have recently begun to dance
 
too, but they are not at all sure about their commitment.
 
The textbook for Father Myron's fifth and sixth grades is God with
 
Us, published in 1
966 by the Standing Conference of Canonical Orthodox
 
Bishops in the Americas. They also have workbooks, homework, and
 
examinations, receiving grades at the end of the year. Their
 
relationship with Father Myron is a warm one; they like and respect
 
him. They feel less pressure to do the homework he assigns, compared to
 
their public—school work, but the work is done and usually on time.

Members of the high school class studied with Mrs. Kovalencko ) too )
 
and also read Ukrainian. Many of the student' in the class are related
 
to each other and see each other at family g
:ttherings, as well as at
 
religious classes,  church, the dance group, :nd UOL functions. Their
 
textbook, Heroes for Truth; The Orthodox C
1
tian Church through the
 
Ages, Volume 1
, was provided by the Religiourl Education Department of
 
the Russian Orthodox Church of America. The classroom studies are
 
directed towards understanding the history of Orthodoxy and the
 
parallel history of t -
 Ukraine. These students also have workbooks,
 
homework, and examinations. They seem to do the work, although they do
 
not appear to take it as seriously as the students a few years younger.
 
This is the age, Father Myron pointed out, at which most stop attending
 
religious school. Natalie Michaluk also mentioned that during high
 
school most students have many other conunitIn nts, and religious school
 
usually fades in importance. With an eye towards keeping them actively
 
involved in church life, Father Myron has arranged for this group to
 
become a church chorus. They will study with an instructor from Boston
 
who will teach them songs in Ukrainian. Along with the songs,  they will
 
receive subtle instruction in Ukrainian history and traditional life.
 
The songs may also increase their Ukrainian vocabularies.

 'doing so.
 
All of the students in the high school class are members of the
 
Odessa Ukrainian Dancers, directed by Thomas Chaharyn and Natalie
 
Michaluk. The dance group is affiliated with the church; weekly
 
rehearsals are held in the church auditorium; their performances raise
 
funds for church activities. This dance group
s begun in 1
976 by Mr.
 
Chaharyn, who has been teaching Ukrainian dancing for fifty years. At
 
age 68 he is no longer physically able to participate as fully in the
 
rehearsals as he would like, so he recruited Natalie to assist him.
 
Natalie has since assumed major responsibility for the group's
 
organization, rehearsals, and bookings.
 
The group rehearses once a week for one and a half to two hours.
 
The dancers and their families accept the responsibility and absence
 
from rehearsal for a frivolous reason is almost unknown. On the oth
 
hand, each of the children is involved in numerous school and sport
 
activities, which cause scheduling problems. The dancers are escorted
 
to rehearsals by a parent or relative, who then remains as an observer.
 
The commitment takes up an entire evening for those who travel some
 
distance to the church.
 
Both of the teenage children of Paula Hreczuck, Mr. Chaharyn's
 
daughter, are dancers, along with a number of her nieces and her
 
nephew. Mrs. Hreczuck was a dancer herself in one of her father's
 
1
9
 
earlier troupes. Her children do not attend religious classes at St.
 
Michael's, although their parents do attend services. Mrs. Hreczuck
 
cited time and distance as the reasons why the children do not attend
 
the one-hour religious class held immediately before the rehearsal.
 
Initially, her children began the dancing to please their grandfather;
 
now they are committed to i
t. As Paula explains,  "it brings out their
 
ethnic identity."
 
Margaret Zelechevsky's mother Anne stressed that her husband was
 
the son of a priest and a dancer from the age of six. Margaret is one
 
of the most talented of the female performers, and her family is very
 
involved in church activities. Since they live some distance from the
 
church, they do not interact with the families of the other dancers at
 
church-sponsored activities.
 
The dancers'  costumes are handsewn copies of costumes brought t
 
this country by the family of Natalie's mother. They are paid for b
 
the families and the dancers own them. New dancers joining the troupe
 
have to make the costume or have it made for them. The red leather
 
boots are ordered from Canada at a cost of $100 per pair. Some dancers
 
buy their own boots, while others use and hand down pairs purchased by
 
the group.
 
Dancers attend a two-week workshop at $oyuzivka, the Ukrainian
 
National Association resort in the Catskill Mountains at Kershonksen,
 
New York in the summer. The resort is known affectionately as "Suzie
 
0" among the parishioners of St. Michael's. The workshop is conducted
 
by Peter Malenchuk, a professionalllbqncer from Canada, who t
ours with
 
three professional companies. Dancers come from all over the United
 
States and Canada to learn and to share their skills and
 
accomplishments. Everyone is extremely enthusiastic about the workshops
 
and the learning that goes on there. The only negative poin 5 once again
 
i
s the fact that many of the dancers are fluent in Ukrainian and speak
 
the language exclusively throughout their time at the resort, leaving

t
'ie workshop is raised by the dancers during the preceding year and
 
supplemented, if necessary, by their parents. At Soyuzivka one may
 
participate in a number of workshops, including those in Ukrainian
 
language and culture.
 
The Odessa Ukrainian Dancers do not stress the regional
 
identification of their dances, except those from the Carpathian
 
Mountains. In performance each dance is introduced by Natalie with a
 
brief explanation of its geographic and social context. The younger
 
dancers are taught basic steps by Mr. Chaharyn. When they are
 
proficient in those steps, Natalie begins their instruction in basic
 
choreography. They are then integrated into the performing troupe as
 
needed. The pre—teenage girls cannot wait to become performers, but the
 
boys, as previously noted, are less enthusiastic. They think that
 
dancing is for sissies, although they hear from the two male dancers,
 
Mark and Michael, about the amount of physical strength and agility
 
that is necessary.

Dancers usually r
emain with the group until they graduate from
 
high school. Some former dancers, now in college, still perform with
 
the troupe occasionally. For the most part, however, marriage and other
 
con
imitments end the affiliation with the group.
 
Our relationship with S

turn of the century. They settled in New England because work
 
s available in the textile mills. Parishioner Anne Michaluk says that
 
r parents left Ukraine,
 t
o make money and pick the gold up off
 
the street."
 
The original Ukranian church in Woonsocket, Rhode Island was St.
 
Michael's, an Eastern Rite Greek Catholic church. In Ukraine there
 
are two major faiths: Orthodox Catholic and Catholic. There has been
 
constant conflict over the years regarding which i
s the "true"
 
Ukrainian faith. The early churches established in the United S
tates
 
often served mixed congregations. United only by their common homeland,
 
continuing disagreements on the parishioners' part sometimes resulted
 
in the establishment of two separate Ukrainian parishes in a single
 
community. That is the case in Woonsocket.
 
The congregation of the original, Catholic-affiliated church in
 
Woonsocket had a conflict with the bishop over the appointment of a
 
priest who had not been properly ordained. A church committee voted to
 
overrule the bishop and padlocked the church. The congregation was
 
divided over the issue. A complicated court case ensued. Eventually,
 
control of the church property, located in Rhode Island, was given to
 
tne existing Catholic congregation, and control or the cemetery,
 
located in nearby Blackstone, Massachusetts, went t
o the rebellious,
 
Orthodox members of the congregation.
 
The Orthodox parishioners, left with a cemetery and no church,
 
held services in various church sites throughout Woonsocket while they
 
raised funds for their own church. In 1938 they purchased land, a
 
house, and a barn on Harris Avenue for $
18,000. The barn was converted
 
into what i
s now a
n  auditorium with a huge kitchen. This space served
 
as both a sanctuary and gathering place for fund-raising dinners,
 
dances, and bingo games. Within two years a parish numbering five or
 
six hundred persons had raised enough money to lay the cornerstone of
 
the church. The mortgage was burned in 1
952.
 
Today, St. Michael's Ukrainian Orthodox Church has a congregation
 
of four to five hundred persons and owns the church building, the
 
priest's residence, and the auditorium building--all insured for a
 
total of $3 million. In addition to its operating funds, the church has
 
investments totaling nearly $
75,000.
 
On Blackstone Street, one and a half blocks away, stands "
the
 
other" St. Michael's, still a viable Ukrainian Catholic parish. Such a
 
split is not unknown in other Ukrainian communities. For example, Linda
 
Oryhon, the wife of the present priest at St. Michael's, did not attend
 
Ukrainian school in her home town of Passaic, New Jersey. The school
 
was operated by the Ukrainian Catholics and Ukrainian Orthodox children
 
were not welcome. In larger cities, like Chicago and New York, with
 
3
 
greater resources and access to teachers and materials, the Ukrainian
 
school exists as an entity entirely separate from the churches.
 
Students attend the religious classes of their faith, but join with
 
Ukrainians of both faiths t
o study their culture, history, and
 
language.
 
Ukrainians do not represent a large percentage of the population
 
of the United States. According to the most recent census,  there are
 
slightly over 500,000 Americans who- claim Ukrainian descent. In
 
Woonsocket the Ukrainians are outnumbered by the dominant
 
French-Canadian population.
 
Rhode Island is a predominantly Roman Catholic s
tate and
 
Woonsocket is a Roman Catholic community. Natalie Michaluk, the
 
kindergarten teacher at St. Michael's, illustrated this with several
 
episodes from her own childhood. In elementary school, for example,  the
 
children were released from public school classes one morning each
 
week to attend catechism class. Natalie was the only child left behind
 
in the classroom. Her Roman Catholic classmates thought she was lucky,
 
but she remembers feeling very much the lonely outsider. On a
 
occasion Natalie met a woman who turned out to live in the sa
 
neighborhood as the  '
1
ichaluks. The woman exclaimed in amazement, "I
 
don't remember seeing you in church." It never occurred to the woman
 
that a resident of Woonsocket would not attend her local Roman Catholic
 
church!
 
4
 
Within this context the Ukrainian (Orthodox) congregation tried t
o
 
educate its children —to teach them about their religion and the
 
language and culture of their ancestry. Anne Michaluk, a parishioner
 
of S
t. Michael's for forty years, says that years ago,  "it was very,
 
very simple, and now it's become complicated." One complication i
s the
 
loss of the Ukrainian language in the home.
 
Mrs. Michaluk grew up in a bilingual home. The Ukrainian school
 
reinforced the spoken language, adding grammar and structure to a
 
language used daily. The books and classroom materials were al
l i
n
 
Ukrainian and no English was necessary. Mrs. Michaluk attended
 
Ukrainian school in Boston, where she was taught by the priest and his
 
wife. This was, and still is, the traditional form of the Ukrainian
 
school —classes are conducted on weekday afternoons and Sunday
 
mornings, and the priest and his wife are the main teachers. Parish
 
volunteers may be called in to teach the younger children, if a ne
 
exists. As Mrs. Michaluk recalls, "the priest would teach the classes,
 
unless the group was large enough or had enough money to hire a
 
professor."
 
St. Michael's was neither large enough nor rich enough, but in
 
1950 they did acquire the services of a professor--Trofim Pasichnyk, a
 
60 -year-old Czechoslovakian college professor with decidedly
 
anti -Communist political feelings. When his writings and outspoken
 
lectures became dangerous in his home country, the underground spirited
 
him out of Europe by way of England. He was attracted to Woonsocket
 
5
 
because of i
ts isolation. According t
o everyone with whom we spoke, h
e
 
lived in fear;  he truly believed that the Communists would find him and
 
eliminate him.
 
Father dalleck, then the pastor of St. Michael's, provided a
 
bachelor apartment at the rear of the Parish House. Mr. Pasichnyk
 
became "
the Professor" and i
s still remembered in those terms. He
 
taught Ukrainian language and culture to thirty-eight children from
 
first grade through high school. He conducted classes in reading and
 
writing the Ukrainian language for interested adult members of the
 
congregation. He also directed the choir and Bandura Male Chorus. In
 
his free t
ime he wrote poetry and played the violin.
 
The Professor remained at St. Michael's for eighteen years,
 
through the tenure of five different priests. He then retired to a
 
friend's home, dying of old age shortly after his retirement. After his
 
death there was a period of a few years during which no Ukrainian
 
school was conducted; the priest continued to offer religious classes,
 
but that was all.
 
The parish then acquired a new priest, Father Kovalencko. He and
 
his wife were recent immigrants to the United States. Father Kovalelicko
 
participated only marginally in the religious education program. Mrs.
 
Kovalencko began teaching Ukrainian language and culture classes to t
 
children as they reached the age of ten. The younger children were
 
taught by Janis Meschiesen, and later by Natalie Michaluk. Both Natalie
 
and the children currently in the h
igh school class remember "Mrs. K"
 
as a woman of  the old world. She spoke heavily accented English and did
 
not interact well with the children. They,  in turn, barely tolerated
 
the classes.  She used a timer to let her know when the class was up.

The children would push the time ahead when her back was turned.  If she

for a visit. The decision to affiliate was mutual; in 1
979 Father
 
Oryhon became the priest of St. Michael's Ukrainian Orthodox Church.  In
 
addition to his duties as the priest, Father Myron, as the parishioners
 
call him, and Pani (mother) Linda had t
o evaluate and revamp the
 
religious and cultural education offered to the church's young people.
 
Father Myron stresses that his i
s an "old immigration" parish.
 
That means that the children in his church school are second- and
 
third-generation Americans, the descendents of those who left Ukraine
 
in the early years of this century seeking economic opportunity. Many
 
of his students come from families in which only one parent i
s
 
Ukrainian and homes in which Ukrainian is no longer, or never was,
 
spoken. Older children in the school learned the Cyrillic alphabet from
 
Mrs. Kovalencko and are able to "read" Ukrainian. Further questioning
 
revealed, however, that while they are able to pronounce the words in
 
Ukrainian properly, they have no idea what they are reading. Eric, a
 
student in the fifth and sixth grade class, says, '
.1 can read it and
 
write i
t, but I really don't know what anything means." They cannot
 
speak or understand spoken Ukrainian either.
 
In contrast, newer immigration parishes are populated by those who
 
left Ukraine after World War II, usually for political reasons. In
 
those parishes most households are still bilingual. The children learn
 
Ukrainian history and develop a sense of ethnic identity through the
 
Ukrainian school. Major "new immigration" parishes exist in Chicago,
 
New York, and Philadelphia. There i
s a sizeable Ukrainian community in
 
Canada, as well.

When Father Myron, who majored in education for two years,
 
examined the curriculum of the classes taught at S
t. Hichael's in 1
979,
 
he found that the children did not understand the concept of Orthodoxy,
 
nor did they know about the growth of the Orthodox faith in Ukraine.
 
Father Myron decided t
o try to separate the faith from the culture. He
 
and his wife, who holds a degree in art education, set up a tentative
 
curriculum designed so that youngel
 children would begin to learn about
 
their Orthodox religion. The new curriculum meant that students would
 
be introduced to the rituals and paraphernalia of their faith first,
 
and later would begin to examine questions relating t
o ethnicity and
 
cultural history.
 
Father Myron grew up as an old-immigration Ukrainian in a
 
new-immigration setting near Chicago. He did not attend Ukrainian
 
school, but did take religious instruction. He can read and write
 
Ukrainian only with difficulty, and cannot converse. He feels that his
 
lack of fluency in the language is not a problem in the Woonsocket
 
parish, although it would be in other settings.
 
Not all members of the parish agree with Father Myron's
 
evaluation. Several with whom we spoke thought that maintaining the
 
Ukrainian language ought to be a duty of all Americans of Ukrainian
 
descent. They were somewhat appalled that their priest, the leader of
 
their church and, symbolically, their cultural and spiritual
 
representative, did not share their feelings. There is intense feeling
 
about the Ukrainian language within the parish, much of it connected to
 
anti-Soviet sentiment generated by the belief that the S
oviets are
 
eliminating the Ukrainian language and culture. Loss of the language,
 
despite r
ecognition that the Ukrainian spoken by immigrants and that
 
used in Ukraine must be idiomatically quite different, represents a
 
loss of U
krainian i
dentity to many parishioners. Linda Oryhon mentions
 
that she t
ook private lessons in Ukrainian before her marriage because
 
she f
eared that her lack of fluency might inhibit her ability t
o f
ill
 
the role o
f the priest's wife properly. Parish members have suggested
 
that Father Myron should enroll in -an intensive c
ourse in
 
conversational Ukrainian offered by Harvard University.
 
The t
eenage and p
re-teenage school children c
omment on their
 
inability t
o carry on
 
Ukrainian summer camp in Pennsylvania, or the dance workshops in New
 
York, they gather with young people from all over the United States and
 
Canada. Many of the children, particularly the Canadians, come from
 
extremely nationalistic family situations and speak f
luent Ukrainian.
 
The contingent from S
t. Michael's feels a little lost and threatened.
 
As one teenager commented, "I don't know whether they're talking t

Father Myron believes that, while the language i
s important, not
 
knowing the language does not make you less important. He believes
 
that tradition and history can be kept alive without a functional
 
knowledge of Ukrainian. His older s
tudents would l
ike very much t
o
 
extend their knowledge of the language, but he maintains that S

One of the ways in which Father Myron encourages the church school
 
participants to feel good about their Ukrainian identity is through
 
membership in the Ukrainian Orthodox League (UOL),  an organization
 
affiliated with the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the United States of
 
America. The membership of the UOL consists of the children of
 
old - immigration families who have not kept up the language. According
 
to Father Myron,  through the UOL,  individuals who do not speak
 
Ukrainian can "feel that they also belong to the Ukrainian community."
 
The children from St. Michael's feel uncomfortable, even apprehensive,
 
in the company of other Ukrainians who are fluent in the language. They
 
feel that they are not truly Ukrainian,  or that they are second-class
 
Ukrainians. The UOL strives to provide an identity for them through
 
parish activities and regional conferences.
 
There are also a number of new-immigration organizations, lik,
 
Vadum, Plast,  and Sum, which are offshoots of Ukrainian political
 
organizations,  drawing membership from both Orthodox and Catholic
 
churches. Like the Boy Scouts, members of these organizations wear
 
uniforms. They also study Ukrainian language and culture.

The present church school is directed by Father Myron and Pani
 
Linda. Their primary goal i
s to provide their students with a firm
 
understanding of their religion. Previously many of the children went
 
to the services but did not understand what was going on;  they did not
 
know about the rituals and their symbolism. In Father Myron's view the
 
children must understand their Orthodox faith so that they can
 
participate fully in the service, whether i
t i
s conducted in English or
 
Ukrainian. Ukrainian customs and traditional songs are part of what
 
should be understood, because they are an integral part of the worship
 
space.The constantly changing curriculum was designed to provide a
 
basic understanding of the religion in the first few years of
 
schooling, so that topics relating to the complex Ukrainian history and
 
culture can be added as the children grow older.
 
Present church-school students aged ten and older studied with
 
Mrs. Kovalencko and "read" Ukrainian. The younger children have had no
 
language training within the church school. They will learn some
 
Ukrainian as i
t is used in the l
iturgy and in t
raditional prayers.
 
Since Father Myron has only been with the parish for three years,
 H
 
curriculum i
s still developing in response to his perceptions o
 
church-school needs. It should also be noted that the Diocesan
 
Commission of Education has a curriculum, but it is regarded as too
 
inflexible by the Oryhons.
 
Classroom materials are purchased by Pani Linda from a number of
 
sources. She maintains contact with other Orthodox churches in the
 
area, since basic religious concepts are shared. She has also attended
 
1
2
 
church-school conferences sponsored by both Antiochan Orthodox and
 
Russian Orthodox (Orthodox Church of America) groups. The Ukrainian
 
Orthodox Consistory sponsors regional and national conferences for
 
teachers, a
s well. Most classroom materials come from the Orthodox
 
Christian Education Commission in Syracuse, New York.
 
In addition t
o the Oryhons, there are two certified
 
elementary school teachers on the faculty. Both of them--Janice
 
Meschiesen and Natalie Michaluk--gfew up in Woonsocket and studied
 
under the Professor and Mrs. Kovalencko. Janice, who is in her
 
mid-thirties, was once Natalie's instructor. They both have input into
 
the selection of materials to be used and the direction classes are to
 
take. If something does not work, or if questions arise, Father Myron
 
is the final arbiter. The curriculum is still being developed. The
 
choice of textbooks and supplementary classroom materials is always
 
open to change as newer items become available. There is no cost to
 
the students —all classroom materials are provided by the church.
 
The s
tudents are grouped by age. The youngest class is the
 
nursery, with students aged three and four. Mary Ann Gritchenko,  the
 
mother of one of the children, and high school student Margaret
 
Zelechevsky teach the nursery. The nursery children are really too
 
young to understand the meaning of the rituals; nonetheless, they
 
discussions about God and learn the names of certain objects, such as
 
icons and censers. They participate in the Sunday morning service and
 
may receive communion.
 
1
3
 
Natalie Michaluk t
eaches the kindergarten class and directs the
 
dance group. Natalie, a kindergarten teacher by profession, has a
 
classroom demeanor that i
s patience personified. She uses Colorforms
 
(plastic stick-ons) to represent the altar in the church and the items
 
used during tae service. The children learn the name of each item and
 
its correct placement in the sanctuary.  Small printed pamphlets
 
describe the significance of the particular Sunday in the church
 
calendar and provide hands-on activities, such as illustrating a given
 
situation. There are also coloring book pages that illustrate and
 
explain the numerous icons. There are six children in the class, which
 
begins and ends with a prayer and t
he traditional crossing of oneself
 
from right to left three t
imes.
 
The first confession class consists of first and second grade
 
pupils--those who are ready to comprehend the significance of their
 
commitment to the church. The class is taught by Janice Meschiesen, a
 
certified elementary school teacher. Janice grew up in a bilingual home
 
and began teaching Sunday school when she was in high school. Her
 
former pupil, Natalie Michaluk, is now the teacher of her five-year-old
 
daughter Melissa.
 
remain committed to the church life through generations. Children like
 
Janice go through the church school, teach in the church school, and
 
then bring their own children to the experience. Priests come and go,
 
but the church and its families remain.
 
1
4
 
While she is delighted with Father Myron and believes that he
 
brings discipline and order to the church and the educational process,
 
Janice i
s disappointed over the absence of Ukrainian classes at the
 
church. She speaks Ukrainian and her husband understands the language,
 
although he is reluctant to speak. She feels that retaining the
 
language is an important aspect of maintaining Ukrainian culture. Even
 
the priest's wife Linda Oryhon expressed concern that her two-year-old
 
son learn the language. She said that she wanted t
o speak Ukrainian to
 
him, but found herself tongue tied,- expressing a desire to f
ind a
 
Ukrainian school for him someday.
 
First Confession is not the same as First Communion in the Roman
 
Catholic church. Parish children have received communion during the
 
service ever since Father Myron came to the church in 1979. He prei
1i-
that young children cannot know sin and, therefore, are able
 
receive communion therefore. Preparation for First Confession involves
 
learning church doctrine and becoming ever more familiar with the
 
details of the altar and the rituals, a familiarity begun during
 
kindergarten. During our last visit to this class one of the primary
 
points made for the children was that fasting from midnight until after
 
the confession did not mean that they could stay up until midnight.
 
There is little to remind the very young children of their Ukrainian
 
heritage in their first classes at the church school. They are learning
 
about their Orthodox faith; understanding the position of the faith in
 
their ethnic background will come later.

Third and fourth grade students are taught by Pani Linda, using
 
the text Finding Your Way through the Bible -
1 The book discusses the
 
Bible on two levels —as a historical document and as the basis of the
 
faith. The children also study the Ukrainian holidays. They are
 
particularly impressed by their unique (and enviable) opportunity to
 
celebrate occasions twice, once during the school holiday and again a
 
week later on the Orthodox date.  In this class homework is assigned and
 
graded, on the basis of effort, not correctness.
 
One student in Pani Linda's class, Lisa, is a fourth grader at S
t.
 
s
, a Roman Catholic School in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. Her
 
is Ukrainian, her father is not. Her father takes her to
 
ious classes and babysits for the Oryhons' son so that Pani Linda
 
ee to teach the class. Lisa is friendly with the other students in
 
ncr class, but, because of the distances, they do not socialize except
 
at church functions. She knows no Ukrainian except the names of items
 
used during the service and some prayers, learned phonetically.
 
The students in the fifth and sixth grades are taught by Father
 
Myron. This group of ten- to twelve-year-olds studied Ukrainian with
 
Mrs. Kovalencko. All of them know the Cyrillic alphabet and can "read
 
and write" Ukrainian. That is, they can pronounce the correct sounds to
 
go with the letters that they see, or produce the correct letter in a
 
written exercise. Only one of them actually understands spoken
 
Ukrainian.

him. They feel less pressure t

their public schoolwork, but the work i

Members of the high school class studied with Mrs. Kovalencko, too,
 
and also read Ukrainian. Many of the students in the class are related
 
t
o each other and see each other at family gatherings, as well a
s at
 
religious classes, church, the dance group, and UOL functions. Their
 
textbook, Heroes for Truth; The Orthodox Christian Church through the
  
Ages, Volume 1
, was provided by the Religious Education Department of
 
the Russian Orthodox Church of America. The classroom studies are
 
directed toward understanding the history of Orthodoxy and t
he
 
parallel history of Ukraine. These students also have workbooks,
 
homework, and examinations. They seem to do the work, although they do
 
not appear t
o take it as seriously as the students a few years younger.
 
This is the age, Father Myron pointed out, at which most stop attending
 
religious school. Natalie Michaluk also mentioned that during high
 
school most students have many other commitments, and religious school
 
usually fades in importance. With an eye toward keeping them actively
 
involved in church life, Father Myron has arranged for this group t

become a church chorus. They will study with an instructor from Boston
 
who will teach them songs in Ukrainian. Along with the songs,  they will
 
receive subtle instruction in Ukrainian history and traditional life.
 
The songs may also increase their Ukrainian vocabularies.
 
Only one member of the high school class, Candace Gemski, comes
 
from a home in which Ukrainian is spoken. She understands enough so
 
that her parents cannot keep secrets from her by speaking the language.
 
Her grandparents encourage her to use Ukrainian. The high school
 
students expressed frustration over their inability to speak and
 
understand Ukrainian, particularly in situations in which they were
 
1
8
 
outsiders in a group of Ukrainian-speaking teenagers. They would, for
 
the most part, like to learn the language, but do not perceive any
 
opportunities for doing so.
 
All of the students in the high school class are members of the
 
Odessa Ukrainian Dancers, directed by Thomas Chaharyn and Natalie
 
Michaluk. The dance group is affiliated with the church; weekly
 
rehearsals are held in the church auditorium;  their performances raise
 
funds for church activities. This dance group was begun in 1
976 by Mr.
 
Chaharyn, who has been teaching Ukrainian dancing for fifty years. At
 
age 68 he i
s no longer physically able to participate as fully in the
 
rehearsals as he would like, so he recruited Natalie to assist him.
 
Natalie has since assumed major responsibility for the group's
 
organization, rehearsals, and bookings.
 
The group rehearses once a week for one and a half to two hours.
 
The dancers and their families accept the responsibility and absence
 
from rehearsal for a frivolous reason is almost unknown. On the other
 
hand, each of the children is involved in numerous school and sports
 
a
ctivities, which cause scheduling problems. The dancers are escorted
 
to rehearsals by a parent or relative, who then remains as an observer.
 
The commitment takes up an entire evening for those who travel some
 
distance to the church.
 
Both of the teenage children of Paula Hreczuck, Mr. Chaharyn's
 
daughter, are dancers, along with a number of her nieces and her
 
nephew. Mrs. Hreczuck was a dancer herself in one of her father's
 
1
9
 
earlier t
roupes. Her children do not attend religious classes at S
t.
 
Michael's, although their parents do attend services. Mrs. Hreczuck
 
cited t
ime and distance as the reasons why the children do not attend
 
the one-hour religious class held immediately before the rehearsal.
 
Initially, her children began the dancing to please their grandfather;
 
now they are committed t
o i
t. As Paula explains, "it brings out their
 
ethnic identity."
 
Margaret Zelechevsky's mother Anne stressed that her husband was
 
the son of a priest and a dancer from the age of six. Margaret is one
 
of the most talented of the female performers, and her family is very
 
involved in church activities. Since they live some distance from the
 
church, they do not interact with the families of the other dancers at
 
church-sponsored activities.
 
The dancers'  costumes are handsewn copies of costumes brought t
o
 
this country by the family of Natalie's mother. They are paid for by
 
the families and the dancers own them. New dancers joining the t
roupe
 
have to make the costume or  have  it made f

Dancers attend a two-week workshop at Soyuzivka, the Ukrainian
 
National Association resort in the Catskill Mountains at Kershonksen,
 
New York in the summer. The resort is known affectionately as "
Suzie
 
Q among the parishioners of St. Michael's. The workshop is conducted
 
20
 
by Peter Malenchuk, a professional dancer from Canada, who t
ours with
 
three professional companies. Dancers come from all over the United
 
States and Canada to learn and to share their skills and
 
accomplishments. Everyone is extremely enthusiastic about the workshops
 
and the learning that goes on there. The only negative point once again
 
is the fact that many of the dancers are fluent in Ukrainian and speak
 
the language exclusively throughout their t
ime at the resort, leaving
 
the dancers from St. Michael's at a disadvantage. The cost of attending
 
the workshop is raised by the dancers during the preceding year and
 
supplemented, if necessary, by their parents. At Soyuzivka one may
 
participate in a number of workshops, including those in Ukrainian
 
language and culture.
 
The Odessa Ukrainian Dancers do not stress the regional
 
identification of their dances, except those from the Carpathian
 
Mountains. In performance each dance is introduced by Natalie with a
 
brief explanation of its geographic and social context. The younger
 
dancers are taught basic steps by Mr. Chaharyn. When they are
 
proficient in those steps, Natalie begins their instruction in basic
 
choreography. They are then integrated into the performing troupe as
 
needed. The pre—teenage girls cannot wait to become performers, but the
 
boys, as previously noted, are less enthusiastic. They think that
 
dancing is for sissies, although they hear from the two male dancers,
 
Mark and Michael, about the amount of physical strength and agility
 
that is necessary.

Dancers usually remain wi t h  the group until they graduate f
rom
 
high school. Some former dancers, now in college, still perform with
 
the troupe occasionally. For the most part, however, marriage and o
ther
 
commitments end the affiliation with the group.
 
Our relationsH
 .
 
with any intensive fieldwork effort, had its moments of exhilarati
 
and some t
imes of total depression. Our study revealed that the present
 
church school places far more emphasis on the Orthodox faith and far
 
less on the Ukrainian identity than we had been led to expect. Father
 
Myron, Pani Linda, the Michaluks, and all the students in the church
 
school impressed us with their warmth, openness, and pride in their
 
ethnic heritage.
 
The parishioners of St. Michael's Ukrainian Orthodox Church
 
perceive their Ukrainian culture as indistinguishable from their
 
Orthodox religion. They are not just Orthodox or just Ukrainian, they
 
are Ukrainian Orthodox. Since Father Myron Oryhon's arrival in 1979,
 
the school has stressed Orthodoxy and there has been no instruction in
 
Ukrainian language. The culture and the history are presented only so
 
far as they pertain to the faith. Father Myron is a third-generation
 
Ukrainian-American serving what he perceives as an old-immigration
 
parish. His immediate predecessors, the Kovalenckos, were
 
first-generation Americans and approached the education of the children
 
from a different perspective.

In French-Canadian Woonsocket, Rhode Island there are two
 
Ukrainian parishes —St. Michael's Ukrainian Orthodox Church and S
t.
 
Michael's Ukrainian Catholic Church. Each has a church school, each has
 
a dance group, and each believes that it represents the true Ukrainian
 
faith.
