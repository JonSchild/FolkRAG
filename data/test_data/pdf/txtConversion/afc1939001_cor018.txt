[Letter from John A. Lomax to Harold Spivacke]
Port Aransas, Texas, 3/12/ 19 39.
Dear Mr. Spivacke:
Without waiting for formal approval of the details of my trip, if you will forward the machine
to me now with no further delay, I agree:
1. In case anything develops to call the trip off to get the machine back to you without cost
to the Library.
2. To include no item in my expense account until the formal approval comes to me from
you.
I'd like to have a few days to practice up and also to get the machine in prime running
condition.
Yours, John A. Lomax
If this request raises any particular problem, tear up the letter and forget it.
