John Holly was a wily desperate man And he carried a gun every day He killed him a man
in the west and then You ought to see John Holly get away.
John Holly he went to the Big Bend train He purposed to make escape But the Big Bend
train was not on time John Holly he proved too late.
John Holly he went to the big ball-room Tossed fifty cents in the game “The man that wins
this fifty cents My gun's gonna blow him away.”
“Oh, fifty cents is all I've got But with fifty cents I'll play And the man that gets this fifty
cents My gun's gonna blow him away.”
“I've been to the east and I've been to the west And I've been this wide world around I've
been on the waters and I've been baptised And I'm standing on my hanging ground.”
“With a silver spade go and dig my grave And a golden chain let me down O, give my
mama the remains of me While I'm sleeping in the cold, cold ground.”
When John Holly was a little boy He was set on his daddy's knee …Big Bend tunnel on the
K & O road Is gonna be the death of me.
