I 
AM drifting down de hill of life, 
I 
never can work any more; 
But de home of childhood still I 
love 
The same as in bright days of yore; 
I've laid down de spade and de hoe, 
With sorrow de heart ne'er can tell; 
And now I'se gwine to lib and die 
In de old log cabin in de dell. 
CHORUS . 
I'se going, going back 
To de home I 
love so well, 
And now I'se gwine to lib and die 
In de old log cabin in de dell. 
When they speak of how I'se gwine te live, 
I 
don't ' zactly know how ' twill be, 
But I 
don't ' spect want will eber come 
While mama libs who set me free; 
He always did like all de hands, 
He was sad when he bid dem farewell ; 
I 
don't think he would see dem starve 
In de old log cabin in de dell. 
I'se going, etc. 
Many changes I 
have passed in life, 
Some bard ones I. don't like to tell— 
But dere soon must be anoder change, 
In de old log cabin in de dell; 
The angel of peace will be dere 
Wid de keys of de home where he dwell; 
And den I'll bid a 
long farewell 
To de old log cabin in de dell. 
I'se going, etc,

WILL YOU LOVE ME WHEN I'M OLD P 
Music by J. Form. 
The Music of this song is published by F. 
A. 
NORTH & CO., 1308 Chest-
nut st., Phila. 
Price 40 cents. 
I 
WOULD ask of you, my darling, 
A 
question soft and low, 
That gives me many a 
heart- ache, 
As the moments come and go. 
Your love I 
know is truthful, 
But the truest love grows cold ; 
It is this that I 
would ask you— 
• 
Will you love me when I'm old '1 
It is this that I 
would ask you— 
Will you love me when I'm old 
CHORUS. 
Life's morn will soon be waning, 
And its ev'ning bells be toll'd; 
But my heart will know no sadness 
If you'll love me when I'm old. 
Down the stream of time together 
We are sailing, side by side, 
Hoping some bright day to anchor 
Safe beyond the surging tide. 
To- day our sky is cloudless, 
But the night may clouds unfold, 
And its storms may gather round us— 
Will you love me when I'm old I 
And its storms may gather round us— 
Will you love me when I'm old 
Life's morn, etc. 
When my hair shall shame the snow- drift, 
And mine eyes shall dimmer grow, 
I 
would lean upon some loved one, 
In the valley as I 
go. 
I 
would claim of you a 
promise, 
Worth to me a 
world of gold; 
It is only this, my darling, 
That you'll love me when I'm old. 
It is only this, my darling, 
That you'll love me when I 
am old. 
Life's morn, etc.

On, promise to meet me when twilight is falling 
Beside the bright waters that slumber so fair; 
Each bird in the meadow your name will be calling, 
And ev'ry sweet rosebud will look for you there; 
It's morning and evening, for you I 
am sighing, 
The heart in my bosom is yours evermore; 
watch for yon, darling, when daylight is dying, 
Sweet rose of Killarney, Mavourneen Astore. 
My heart is a 
nest that is robbed and forsaken, 
When gone from my sight is the girl that I 
love! 
One word from your lips can my gladness awaken— 
Your smile is the smile of the angels above 
Then meet me at twilight beside the bright waters, 
The love that I've told you, I'd whisper once more; 
Oh, sweetest and fairest of Erin's fair daughters— 
Dear rose of Killarney, Mavourneen Astore. 
TELL ME WHERE IS FANCY BRED. 
TELL me where is fancy bred, 
Or in the heart, or in the head 1 
How begot, how nourished 7 
It is engender'd in the eyes, 
With gazing fed; and fancy dies 
In the cradle where it lies : 
Let us all ring fancy's knell; 
I'll begin it,—Ding, dong, bell, 
Ding, dong, bell.

A SKETCH FOR TWO CHARACTERS—PomrzY and LISA JAKR. 
[Scene, full stage garden. 
Set cottage R. H. Sd E. A 
small 
box or barrel on stage to sit on. 
Enter POMPEY to introductory 
Music. 
Sits on barrel or box, and lights a 
small pipe.] 
POMPEY.—Just come down to see the apple of my eye, that 
dear, sweet, bewitching little yellow gal, Lisa Jane! 
Talk 
about your Venuses and such trash! You ought to see her. 
Why, she's so sweet, that she can't go out in the fields with-
out a 
veil, for fear of the bees lighting on her, she looks so 
much like a 
walking rose. 
Then she says I'm her darling. 
Hi 
I 
feel like a 
sunfish just caught. I 
can't keep still. 
I 
think I 
must be in love. 
That's her cottage, where she lives 
with her ma and pa. I 
wonder if she's home. 
011,.my I 
bow 
I 
would like to see her; yet my heart beats as if I 
had a 
loco-
motive and train of cars inside my shirt-front. 
[Liss JANE sings inside cottage.] 
Am —" 
Old Kentucky Home." 
The sun shines bright in my old Kentucky home, 
'Tis summer, the darkies are gay; 
The corn-top 's 
ripe, and the meadows are in bloom, 
And the birds make sweet music all the day. 
The young folks roll on the little cabin floor, 
All merry, all happy and bright; 
Bimeby hard times comes a-knocking at the door, 
Then my old Kentucky home " good night I " 
[POMPEY listens attentively. 
LISA JANE, at the end of the 
1st verse, backs out of the cottage. POMPEY joins in the chorus, 
without being discovered by LISA JANE until the end.] 
CHORUS. 
Weep no more, my lady, weep no more to-day, 
For we'll sing one song for my old Kentucky home 
For my ad Kentucky home far away. 
LISA JANE.—Is that you, Pompey? [Gives hand.] How 
you frightened me!

GOLDEN SHOWERS.—[CONTINUED.] 
POMPEY.—Did I? I 
take it back. 
You don't know, Lisa 
Jane, how glad I 
am to see you. 
Howlve you been ? How's 
ma and pa? 
LISA JANE.—All well, and lively as crickets. 
POMPEY.—Do 
you know, Lisa Jane, that I've come down to 
ask the old couple if they'll have me for a 
son-in-law? 
Liss JANE.—Oh, go 'way now! For fie I 
that's ' very un-
wrong of you! [
Biting her apron corner.] 
POMPEY.—FactI that's what I 
came down here for. 
Took 
the gravel train early this morning and walked. 
Liss JANE — Oh, stop your fooling now. 
POMPEY.—Tell me, now, you don't like any other fellow, do 
you? 
LISA JANE.—Oh, go 'long! 
POMPEY.—Do you care for fat Jake? 
LISA. JANE.—Now. who's been telling you 'bout him 2 
POMPEY.—There I 
I 
knew you didn't care for him. 
Or slim 
Jim ? 
LISA JANE — Oh, behave! how you like to tease I 
POMPEY.—I 
thought I 
was the only one. 
You don't know 
how happy you make me, when you talk like that. 
[The first strain of galop is played very softly. 
LISA. JANE 
and POMPEY strike positions, and stand perfectly still and lis-
ten. 
At second strain, played very loudly, a 
burlesque around 
the stage, both going in opposite directions, until the song begins. 
At second strain of the song they work to the back of the stage; 
and at third strain of the song they schottish down to the front 
again.

THE LITTLE OLD LOG CABIN IN THE LANE 
[Copyright, 1875, by ROBERT M . 
DEW ITT.] 
A SKETCH FOR TWO CHARACTERS—W urrz AND BLAcK. 
[Scene, a 
little log cabin. POMP is seated by the door. 
As 
th,e curtain rises the symphony of the sang is played softly.] 
POMP.—How the good ole times am changed! 
Dare's no-
body left about the place to talk to old Pomp now. 
Massa 
tone, and missis too. 
Even my dog has left me. 
Well, well, 
I'm only waiting for de summons to come along for poor old 
Pomp. Many and many a 
year I've trabbled on de road, and 
I'm footsore and weary now. 
[Enter HENRY] 
HENRY.—Why, as I 
live, it's old Pomp! Pomp, don't you 
know me? 
Pon'.—Yes—no. Why—why, it's Massa Henry! 
HENRY.—The same. I 
see your old eyes are good for some-
thing yet. 
PomP.—Well, well, war did ye come from ? 
HENRY.- 0h, I've been traveling up and down the world 
for the last seven or eight years. 
But how is everything on 
the old plantation ? 
Pon'.—All gone to ruin. 
Everybody 'cept me gone dead. 
HENRY.—Cheer up, old friend. 
Why, you used to be as 
lively as a 
cricket. 
No song was as gay as yours on the old 
plantation. 
Where's the old banjo? 
POMP.—Hangs up on the wall; I 
haven't the heart to pick 
on de strings any more. 
HENRY.—Come, Uncle Pomp, sing us a_ song. 
Maybe 'twill 
rouse you up. 
Tell me something about the old home. 
POMP.—W ell, well, Massa Henry, I 
can't sing like I 
used 
to, but I'll try. 
[The music plays " The Little Old Log Cabin." Pomp is as-
sisted on his feet by HENPY. They came forward, and POMP 
sings. 
At the end of each chorus PONP listens to the dance which 
is played, and after one or two efforts he throws aside his hat, 
and commences the step. 
At the conclusion of the song he is 
completely tired out, and is assisted to the door of the cabin by 
HENRY. 
The dance is played softly until the curtain falls.]

LITTLE darling, mill upon me, 
Turn to me thy face so bright, 
Let thine eyes with love beam on me, 
Fill my heart with deep delight,; 
Ah, sa fondly art thou cherish'd, 
Life itself hangs on the thought, 
That some day I 
hope to win thee, 
Sweetest prize that love e'er sought. 
Ah ! 
CHORUS. 
Little darling, smile upon me, 
Let me by thy side remain, 
While your eyes with love, beam on me, 
Little darling, smile again, again. 
Little darling, smile upon me,

how sweet that smile of thine! 
Lay thy hand, so soft and dainty, 
Trustingly to rest in mine ; 
For thy life so bright and happy, 
Safe I'll guard from care or pain ; 
Little darling, smile and bless me, 
Tell me not to hope in vain. 
Ali! 
Little darling, etc. 
Little darling, smile upon me, 
Let me hear thy voice so sweet, 
Whisper softly that you love me, 
Dearest one, those words repeat; 
Do not let those wavy tresses 
Veil from me those lovely eyes ; 
Turn, my darling, smile upon me, 
Brightest treasure 'neath the skies. 
Ah

York. Price 10 cents. 
Copyright, 1876, by E. H. HARDING. 
0, GIVE me one true heart, 
I 
crave no other boon than this. 
To know affection's tender wiles, 
And all its joy and bliss; 
On some fond, faithful heart to lean 
This weary head of mine, 
And then forget the woes of earth, 
And all its cares resign. 
CHORUS. 
0, give me one true heart, 
I 
crave no other boon than this; 
To know affection's tender wiles, 
And all its joy and bliss. 
I 
do not know if in this world, 
There is another soul, 
Which feels the wild and wayward grief, 
That o'er my own doth roll; 
For even when they deem me gay, 
Because my laugh is light, 
My spirit's lost within itself, - 
In solemn, starless night.

Price 30 cents. 
ONE day, as I 
was going by that part of Holborn christened High, 
I 
heard a 
wild and sudden cry that chill'd my very blood ; 
Out from a 
court like one possess'd, a 
woman ran with heaving 
breast; 
She turned her East, turn'd her West, and then bounced thro' 
the mud. 
At length her pent-up fury ' gan to reach that boiling point, just 
capable of speech, 
And with a 
cry as wild as ocean birds with wild exclaim, she 
gave her sorrow words. 
0, Lord! 0, dear! my heart will break—I 
shall go stick, 
staring, stark wild ! 
Has ever a 
one seen anything like a 
lost-looking crying child 7 
Lawk help me! I 
don't know where to look or run! 
If I 
only 
knew which way, 
But a 
child as is lost in the " Seven Dials " is like a 
needle in 
a 
bottle of hay. 
Oh, will no one tell me where he's gone? 
With bursting grief 
my heart is torn; 
I 
wish I 
never had been born—I've lost, I've lost my child. 
Do, good people, move on, and don't be staring like a 
parcel of 
stupid young pigs; 
Saints forbid ! perhaps he's been inveigled up a 
court, for the 
sake of his clothes, by the prigs— 
He'd got on nearly all his best, and they wasn't so very much 
tore; 
His jacket and pants cost eighteen pence—but I 
shan't see him 
nor them any more. 
Oh, will no one tell me where he's gone? 
With bursting grief 
my heart is torn ;. 
I 
wish I 
never had been born— I've lost, I've lost my child. 
He'd got on a 
very good pinafore, with two slits and a 
burn on 
the breast; 
But. his shirt, it's lucky I'd in the washtub, or it might have 
gone with the rest; 
He'd a 
goodish sort of a 
hat, if the crown was left in, and not 
so much jagged at the brim, 
With one shoe off— and the shoe's a boot, and not a 
fit, and 
you'll know him by that, if it's him. 
Oh, will no one tell me where he's gone ? 
With bursting grief 
my heart is torn ; 
I 
wish I 
never had been born— I've lost, I've lost my child.

THE LOST CHILD.—Concluded. 
The last time as I 
ever seed him was with my own two blessed 
motherly eyes, 
Sittin' as good as goold in the gutter, a- making of little dirt-
pies; 
Why should he leave the court, where he was better off than 
all the other boys? 
With two bricks, an old shoe, nine oyster- shells, and a 
dead 
kitten, by way of toys 
Oh, will no one tell me where he's gone I With bursting grief 
my heart is torn; 
I 
wish I 
never had been born—I've lost, I've lost my child. 
And if I 
call him a 
beauty, it's no lie, but only as a mother 
ought to speak— 
I 
never set eyes on a 
handsomer face—only it ain't been washed 
for a 
week; 
As for his hair, tho' it's red, it's the nicest red, when I've time 
just to show it the , comb— 
owe him five pounds, and a 
blessing besides, as will bring 
him safe and sound home! 
Oh, will no one tell me where he's gone 1 With bursting grief 
my heart is torn ; 
I 
wish I 
never had been born—I've lost, I've lost my child. 
lie's blue eyes and not to be call'd a 
squint, tho' a 
little cast 
he has got. 
And his nose is still a good ' un, tho' the bridge is broken ,by 
falling over a 
pewter pint-pot; 
Oh, Billy, I'm as hoarse as a 
crow, thro' calling after you, you 
young sorrow, 
And I 
shan't have half a 
voice left for crying " red-herrings," 
to- morrow! 
Oh, will no one tell me where he's gone 1 • With bursting grief 
my heart is torn ; 
I 
wish I 
never had been born—I've lost, I've lost my child. 
I 
only wish l'd got him safe in these arms—oh, wouldn't I 
hug 
and kiss him! 
I 
never thought how precious he was—but a 
child don't feel like 
a 
child till you miss him; 
Why, there he is, Punch and Judy hunting— it's that young 
wretch, Billy, as certain as sin ; 
But—just let me get him by the scruff of the neck, and I 
won't leave a 
whole hone in his skin! 
Oh, you little varmint! ain't I 
riled ! but saints be praised, I've 
found my child! 
With joy I 
shall go almost wild! I've found, I've found my 
child.

To meet her smile and loving greeting; 
Farewell, darling,

OLD BLACK JOE.

DEWITT.] 
A f'lliETCH FOR TWO CHARACTERS—WHITE and BLAott. 
[See?-e, a road—plantation in the distance. 
Enter OLD 
BLACI JOE, as the music plays "Home, sweet home." He 
leans upon his staff, and listens.] 
OLD BLACK JOE.— Home, sweet home! 
Oh, how long I 
have sighed to see it once again. 
I've been a 
wanderer up 
and don the world for the last twelve years, and many a 
time have I dreamt of the old plantation and the old folks 
there. 
1",nd now, when I'm almost to my journey's end, I 
arrive in sight of the dear old place at last. 
I haven't gat 
many more miles to go before I'll lay these poor old bones of 
mine down for the last time. 
How well I 
remember good old 
massa and missis. 
Den there was young Massa Charles, and 
den there waN my wife Clohoe. 
De tears come rolling down 
my cheeks when I 
think of old times. 
But I 
must plod along 
to the old plaukt tion. 
[Enter CHARLES.] 
CHARLES. — Why, as I 
live, it's Old Black Joe! 
OLD JOE.—W ho calls Old Black Joe? I 
haven't heard that 
name in twelve leg years. 
CHARLES.—why, don't you know me, Joe? 
Don't you 
know your old MaiNsa (:‘' Ilarles' son, whom you used to danea 
upon your knee ? 
OLD JOE.—What1 ye Massa Charles' son—young Massa 
Charles ? 
Well, well. 
[They shake hands.] 
CHARLES.—Yes, Joe; awl I'm glad to see you back. 
OLD JOE.—But tell mA. how is old massa, Massa Charles 7 
Is he well ? 
CHARLES.—Joe, I'm sorry to say the old gentleman, my 
father, has passed away. 
OLD JOE.—Old massa gonn! 
Good old massa! 
How is 
missis? 
CHARLES.-011, thanks be to haven, she is still an-onEr us, 
OLD JOE. —
And—and—Charles, how is my pcor old wife, 
Aunt Clohoe ? 
Is she well ? 
CHARLES.—Alas 
she's been to rest tbese Eve years.

OLD BLACK JOE.—{CONTINUED.1 
OLD JOE.—Oh, don't say that, Massa Charles! 
Don't say 
that! 
CHARLES.—IVS too true, Joe. 
But cheer up! 
Welcome 
back home; you shall never leave us again. 
OLD JOE.—Can I 
stay on the old plantation, mama! 
CHARLES.—Yes, my dear old playmate. 
OLD Jo.—Thank ye, Massa Charles, thank ye! 
And so 
they are all gone. 
Even my poor wife. 
I think I 
hear their 
' 
voices calling me; and I 
feel that I 
soon shall go. 
CHARLES.—Don't you recollect that good old song you used 
to sing once on a 
time, Joe? 
The one you called Old Black 
Joe? 
OLD JOE. — Yes, yes; but I 
haven't had the heart to sing it 
these many days. 
CHARLES.—Do sing it for me now, that's a 
good fellow; and 
I'll go down to the foot of yonder tree, and listen as I 
used to 
do when I 
was a 
little boy. 
OLD JOE.—If it will please you, Massa Charles, I 
will. 
CHARLES.—Do. 
The sound of your voice, once again, will 
bring back a 
thousand reminiscences of the days that are past. 
Sing the old song, Joe. 
[Exit CHARLES.] 
OLD JOE.—Ah I once I 
was happy when I 
sung; but novr 
Old Joe is pretty nigh broken down. 
[The music plays " Old Black Joe." OLD JOE sings the 1st 
verse. 
In the Chorus, the words" I'm coming," are echoed after 
JOE behind the scenes; the remainder of Chorus is sung by JOB, 
with the exception of the last line, which is sung very softly 
behind the scenes also. 
After the conclusion of the song, 
CHARLES returns, and slowly leads OLD JOE off the stage. 
OLD JOE, overcome with emotion, leans upon his young massa.

UNDER the snow, the cold white snow, 
My darling she's sleeping to- night, 
A 
chaplet of flow'rs encircles her brow, 
Her brow now so spotless and white; 
They laid her away in the cold, dark grave, 
Where the moonbeam's silv'ry light 
Shines down on her home where the willows wave 
Above my darling to-night. 
CHORUS. 
Sleeping to- night, sleeping to-night, sleeping, 
Sleeping, sleeping to-night, 
Sleeping, sleeping 'neath the cold white snow, sleeping. 
I'm sitting to-night in her lonely room, 
The midnight hour draws near; 
Methinks I 
hear duo' the silent gloom, 
My loved one's step on the stair; 
All, no! ' twas the sound of the wind harp that sigh'd 
Through the ivy that climbs round the door; 
For my darling's at rest, she's an angel now, 
And her step I'll hear no more. 
Sleeping to- night, etc. 
Spring, with its fragrant vales and flowers, 
Will soon be here again; 
In wooded dell, and vine-clad bowers, 
I'll seek for my darling, in vain; 
When sunbeams shall fall on her lowly bed, 
I'll strew there sweet emblems of love. 
And where snows never come, and flowers ne'er fade, 
I 
will find my lost darling above. 
Sleeping to- night, etc.

StLv'nv stars are softly gleaming 
In the peaceful evening sky, 
And I 
think my love is dreaming, 
Sweetly dreaming I 
am nigh; 
O'er her eyes like dewy pansies 
Silken lashes gently sweep, 
And the angels guard are keeping 
Round my darling's peaceful sleep. 
CHORUS. 
Silv'ry stars are softly gleaming 
In the azure arch above, 
And I 
know that thou art dreaming, 
Dreaming, dear, of me and love. 
Breezes blowing from the southland, 
Where the summer never dies, 
Go and kiss her lips in slumber, 
• 
Kiss my darling's pansy eyes; 
Whisper to her softly, gently, 
Of the one from whom you came, 
And I 
know that in her slumber 
She will smile, and speak my name. 
Silviry stars, etc. 
Sleep, and may the angels keep you 
Ever always in their care; 
May your life-dreams be as pleasant, 
As your dreanis in slumber are ; 
Sleep, and dream of him who loves you 
With a 
love both deep and strong, 
And your dreams shall be an echo 
Of his little starlight song. 
Silviry stars, etc.

W ELL, there now, did you ever 7 
Ma says I'm dreadful bold ; 
Because when men come courting, 
not reserv'd or cold ; 
Now, gents, pray tell We, would you have me 
Make a 
face that's wry 7 
Or when you ask me once to kiss you, 
Like a 
fool to cry ? 
SPOKEN.—No, no! 
I'm sure you would rather I'd say— 
cnonus. 
Keep on kissing me, keep on kissing me, 
Bless me, Bob, don't be so shy ; 
Keep on kissing me, keep on kissing me ! 
Once more, only, love, to try; 
Keep on kissing me, keep on kissing me! 
'Tis the height of true love's bliss, 
Keep on kissing me, keep on kissing me ! 
No joy equals love's fond kiss. 
Bob says not to mind mother, 
When she was young like me 
She ne'er thought men a 
bother, 
Or married would not be ; 
And so I 
thought if men would follow, 
l'd not say them nay; 
Nor for my mother, or any other, 
Bid them turn away. 
SPOKEN.— But I've made up my mind that when the rigt z 
one comes along I'll say— 
Keep on kissing, etc. 
I 
think that Bob means business, 
Tho' not much yet he's said ; 
But truly from his actions, 
I 
think he means to wed; 
Now should he ask me if I'll have him, 
I'll not bid him wait, 
And say the sea bolds plenty fishes, 
For oft we lose our bait. 
SPOKEN.—Oh, yes! I 
tell you, these giddy girls who kee; 
saying, " There's just as good fish in the sea as ever wen 
caught!" 
They forget that sometimes they lose their bait 
Not for me! 
Oh, no! 
I'll continue saying— • 
Keep on kissing, etc.

COME twine your white arms 'round my neck, love 
And lay your dear head on my breast; 
For then I 
can watch and protect you 
And nurse you, my darling, to rest. 
The rays of the moon thro' the window, 
The twinkle of stars in the skies, 
Will give me the light to admire 
Those beautiful dreaming eyes. 
'Come twine your white arms 'round my neck, love, 
And lay your dear head on my breast; 
For then I 
can watch and protect you, 
And nurse you, my darling, to rest. 
Come touch your pink lips to my cheek, love, 
And bring the red rose tint again; 
For it has, you see, long departed, 
And left me an object of pain. 
The cares of the past have been many, 
And trouble the patient defies ; 
So, come, dear, and let me admire 
Those beautiful dreaming eyes. 
Come twine, etc. 
Come breathe your affection to me, love, 
And say that you'll always be true; 
For all that's concealed in this bosom, 
My sweet one, I'd give unto you. 
The time will not linger a 
moment, 
So, darling, make haste, and arise; 
For happiness ' tis to admire 
Those beautiful dreaming eyes. 
Come twine, etc.

Hold me, mother, to your breast, 
Let my weary head find rest, 
Fold me in your kind embrace, 
Cheer me with your smiling face. 
Hold me, mother, to your breast, 
For I 
feel like one oppress'd ; 
Take me in your arms again, 
Rid my broken heart of pain; 
In that summer long ago, 
Little did I 
dream of woe, 
Or that I 
should now come back 
In this solemn garb of black. 
Hold me, etc. 
Hold me, mother, to your breast, 
For my heart is sore distress'd ; 
Drive away this care and grief, 
In your voice there is relief; 
Where the south winds gently blow, 
They have laid my darling low; 
And I 
now return to you, 
Dearest mother, kind and true. 
Hold me, eta.

In days that have long pass'd away 
Oh, where is her sweet smiling face, 
Those lips that I

Her vision I 
see in my dreams, 
It whispers to me of the past, 
And like a 
bright angel it seems 
As from me it vanishes so fast.

Oh, where is her sweet smiling face, 
And lips that I 
kiss'd ev'ty day 7 
Oh, she was the dearest of all; 
Her vOws they were tender and true, 
And then her dear, soft, laughing voice, 
Those eyes of a 
calm summer blue; 
The warbling of birds in the wood 
Could never compare with my love, 
For she was both faithful and good— 
Oh, she was a 
darling little dove. 
Oh, where is, etc. 
They tell me that far o'er the hill, 
Where often in childhood we played, 
she's sleeping that long peaceful sleep, 
her grave with sweet flowers is array'd ; 
If angels have bade her arise 
From parents and kindred so dear, 
I'll seek once again those dear skies, 
And drop on her silent mound a 
tear. 
Oh, where is, etc.

MY GAL. 
[Copyright, 1875, by ROBERT M . 
DEWITT.] 
A SKETCH FOR TWO CHARACTERS—DRESSED ALIKE. 
[Scene, a 
street. 
Enter AUGUSTUS, who looks around as if 
expecting some one. 
He is dressed as a 
fop.] 
AUGUSTUS.—I 
wonder where she can be? 
She made an ap-
pointment to meet me here precisely at eight. 
It's past that 
now. 
I 
wonder if she will disappoint me? No; I 
don't be-
lieve she will, for I 
flatter myself I have won that palpitating 
little heart of hers. 
Oh, she's a beauty I Nobody else stands 
a show to win her from me. 
Why, she wouldn't look at 
another chap. 
I'm her only beau. 
Where can she be? 
Girls 
are always late. 
Hello! I 
wonder who this is? 
He ooks 
enough like me to be my twin. 
[Enter ADOLPHUS.] 
ADOLPHUS.—She said she'd be here at eight. I 
hope she's 
not going to disappoint. 
I never knew her to break her 
promise. 
Oh, she's just the sweetest little angel out of para-
dise I Such eyes! 
Such hair! 
And then she loves me so. 
She calls me pet and sugar-plum, and all sweet cognomens 
like these. 
Then the best of it is she won't even look at any 
other fellow. [
Sees AuGusTus.] 
Hello! [
Aside.] 
I 
wonder 
what he's dodging around here for. 
Why, he's got into my 
clothes. 
I'll 
accost his royal highness. 
How do you do, 
stranger ? 
AUGUSTUS.--Pin lively, thank you. 
What's the news? 
ADOLPHUS.—Oh, nothing. 
You didn't happen to see a 
pretty little gal passing by here, did you? 
AuGusTus.—What sort of a gal? 
Tall, short, slim, stout, or 
otherwise? 
ADOLPIIUS.—Well, I 
guess otherwise. 
AUGUSTUS.—No. I 
was looking for a 
little gal myself. 
ADOLPHUS.—Yes; what kind of a looking gal is she? 
AuGusTurs.—Oh, she's not very tall, dark eyes, lovely ring-
lets, dimpled chin, and pearly teeth. 
She was to meet me 
here at eight. 
ADOLPHUS (
aside).—I 
begin to smell a mice. 
AUGUSTUS.—She never failed to keep her appointment 
(

MY GAL.—[CoNTINITED .] 
before. I 
guess she'll come along soon. [
Begins to draw on 
gloves.] 
ADOLPHUS (draws on gloves of the same color).—I 
guess 
she'll be here. 
What's your gal's name? 
AUGUSTUS.—Melinda Jane. 
ADOLPHUS.-0 heavens! that's my gal's name! 
AUGUSTUS.—Your gal's name? Do you mean to 
know my Melinda Jane ? 
ADOLPHUS.— Your Melinda Jane ? 
AUGUSTUS.—Yes; my Melinda Jane I 
ADoLPHUS.—Why, I 
guess not; she's going to meet me 
here at eight. 
AUGUSTI7S.—She promised to meet me, too 
ADOLPHUS.—Oh, I 
guess not! 
AuGusTus.—Oh, I 
guess yes! 
ADOLPHUS.—Oh, no! 
AUGUSTUS.-01i, yes I 
ADOLPHUS.—She says I'm her only beau. 
AuGusTus.—She says she'll expire for me. 
ADOLPHUS.—Oh, go 'way, child. 
AUGUSTUS.—Shrimp, depart! 
ADOLPHUS.—She's my 
gal, anyhow. 
AUGUSTUS.—I say she's my gal. 
ADOLPHUS.—She's mine! 
AUGUSTUS.—She's mine! 
say you

Bring the absent back to me.

Will point the sunny way, 
And with a

I'll reach where all obey.

[Copyright, 1876, by Roam' M. DEWirr.] 
A SKETCH FOR TWO CHARACTERS. 
Enter JOHN, an old man. [ The symphony of song is played.] 
and then enter in an oppositte direction, JOE, an old Irian. 
JOHN. —Well, well, as I 
live it's my old friend and crony, Joe ! 
well, well. 
JOE. — Is that you, John ? Why it can't be that you are in 
the land of the living. 
JOHN. — Well, if I'm not, at any rate I'm a 
pretty lively sort 
of ghost, ain't I, Joe ? 
Give us your fist. 
Ha! ha! 
JOE.—Glad indeed to see you, old friend John! 
JOHN. —Glad to see you, old friend Joe! [They shake hands 
cordially.] 
Jos.—Why, let me see, its a 
long while since we've met, and 
we're both very near to the bottom of the hill, hey, John ? 
JoHN.—Aye, aye; but barrin' a 
little bit of rheumatiz, these 
old legs of mine are good for many a 
mile yet. 
JOE. — Yes, yes; why, we're as good as the best of 'em: al-
though the snow is falling on our heads, there's plenty of 
warmth beneath. 
Ha! ha! 
JoHN.—And then what good old times we've had, hey, Joe / 
Do you remember the rosy-cheeked girls we've kissed in our 
youth ? 
JOE. — Do I ? 
Shall I 
ever forget 'ena ? 
JOHN. —And the jolly meeting with our companions! 
JOE.—And the bouts we've had over our punch ! 
JOHN. -And the picnics! 
JOE.—And the songs we've sang. 
JOHN. — Ha! ha! 
ha! 
[Suddenly checks himself, and holds 
his side as if in pain.] 
Joz.—Ho! 
ho! 
ho! 
[Suddenly puts his hand to his 
back.] 
The symphony is played very softly. 
John and Joe clasp 
hands, and each in turn sing a 
verse of the song, both joining 
in the chorus. 
Evit at the conclusion, singing the chorus.

John.—There's gladness in remembrance, Joe, 
Our friendship has been true, 
In all the weal and woe of life, 
No change that friendship knew. 
We've miss'd some lov'd ones, one by one, 
And twin'd our wreaths of heather, 
In fancy as we've cleck'd their tombs, 
Since we were boys together. 
Both. 
Since we were boys, merry, merry boys, 
Since we were boys together, 
Unalter'd is our friendship, Joe. (or John.) 
Since we were boys together. 
Joe.—I 
need not bid thee ponder, John, 
You know our prime is o'er: 
The flow'r, the nest, the humming-bee, 
For us will charm no more, 
And our frail forms are fading fast, 
We could not bound the heather, 
As hand in hand with gladsome brows, 
We did when boys together. 
.Both. 
When we were boys, merry, merry boys, 
When we were boys together, 
Through many sunny years, friend John, (or Joe.) 
May we yet live together.
