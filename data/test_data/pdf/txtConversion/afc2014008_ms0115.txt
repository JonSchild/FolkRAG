Dear Portia:
 
P
 
It was great to get a chance t
o t
alk with you during the SEM meetings.  Vet
 
sorry I didn't see you again before I left.  I had wanted t
o congratulate you
 
for the efficient and eloquent way i
n which yott chaired the panel, and f
or
 
all the work and planning that l
ay behind i
t.  My contribution aside, I
 
thought the three other papers as a group were f
ar and away the most interesten;,
 
effectively presented and well thought out of any such set I heard at e
ither
 
meeting.  I hope you feel good about i
t too.
 
I am enclosing some of the things I promised to send along.  The others will
 
arrive l
ater when I can get to them.  So :
c
ar, I
've been able to round up a
 
copy of my brother's paper on the homogeneity of African and Afro-American
 
singing style, plus an earlier paper of his, "Song Structure and Social
 
Structure" which I think explains his approach better than any other he's
 
done, and which I would recommend your reading before the African one.  If
 
you have time, I
'd l
ike to hear what you think of there.  The African article,
 
by the way, has been reprinted in slightly shortened form, in Afro-American
 
Anthropology by Norman Whitten and John S
vwed; somebody has borrowed my copy
 
and I f
orget the publisher but i
t car
ne out in 1
970, I
'm s
ure.  I
i y
ou haven't
 
seen that book, I think you would be interested.
 
I
'm also enclosing a xerox of the description of the Summer Institute in Visual
 
Anthropology I mentioned to you.  The fellow I borrowed this from had already
 
sent his application in; i
f you're interested, y
ou can get an application by
 
writing Dr. Jay Ruby, SIVA, '
Temple University, Philadelphia, Pa., 19122.  The
 
deadline f
or receipt of completed applications i
s December lith.
 
I haven't been in touch with our computer friend, Jerome, a
s yet; I
'll write
 
about that l
ater, plus sending you the film information you asked f
or.  Our campus
 
computer ;
aan
. s
ays we have a GE computer rather than the kinds you wrote down f
or n
te;
 
however, he assures r
i
ie that any program c
an be adapted to any kind of hardware.
 
Again, i
t was a real pleasure to get acquainted.  I hope we'll be seeing you next
 
semester.

Dear Professor Maultsby:
 
`hank you for your informative letter of September 24th.  Unfortunately, throu6h
 
no fault of your own, it left me with a njinber o' questions.
 
When Mrs. Krader invited me to the 6Ebi meeting, she asked me to present one or more
 
of the various films I had done.  Since she wasn't very specific, I wrote her givinr;
 
fill details on the three fiLas o
.i
' Afro.-American folk z
i
iusic that I have had a hand
 
in, and she replied sa6gesting that I plan to present all three, since there would
 
be a session on Saturday evening (possible) and on Sunday morninL (for sure).
 
It seems  rom the pro`
;ran that the Saturday session has been eliminated; in the
 
meantime, Mrs. Krader wrote suE;6esting I plan to present both Pizza Pizza Daddy 0 --
a film on the traditional musical games of black urban children -
- and Briijht 
Star Shining in G
lo m -
- a film on the religious music and dance oi
` St Simon 's 
Island, Georgia.  However, both films run 18' each, so, with your schedule, I
 
can't see the possibility of showing
; both.
 
I assume, also from the program, tbpt Pizza has been the film of choice, but I do
 
want to confirm this with you so that I can be prepared with appropriate comment.
 
You say,  "
I was impressed by your abstract", which confuses we a trifle, since I
 
sent no abstract except a brief account 02 what was on each film.  The point is that
 
if you want an account of the clapping practices I wrote Mrs. Krader about, Pizza 
does not show them, except for one brief sequence of children clappin  triple time
 
a
fainst a song in duple meter (standard practice among; black children hereabouts).
 
Either of the other two films, Bright Star or Buck Dancer would show adult complex
 
clapping; better; Bright Star runs, as I said, 18 minutes and Buck Dancer 8 minutes.
 
I
'm perfectly happy to bri m all three and probably will anyway.  I had also hoped
 
to be able to re?Ort in a sort of interim way on an analysis via C
ilia '
time-motion''
 
study techniques of the adult clapping; style; however, it seems clear that there
 
will be no time for that since the films run so long.  I don't want to seen to be
 
shif
'tine; the burden of decision upon you; I really just want to be sure that what
 
the program says you're getting is what you want.  Actually, I
'm flexible as all
 
get-out and wouldn't mind changing; horses even after I get there; this whole area
 
has been an interest of mine for some years now and I
'm prepared to spout off ad
 
lib, anless a highly technical approach is desirable, in whi ch case I would prepare
 
di: 2erently.
 
I hope you are not as confused as I now 3
'eel.  If you want i
ie to make up my own mind
 
and come and do what I want to do, that's fine.  On the other hand, having been per-
sonally invited to attend and having had certain specific reques
ts ma de of  me,  I 
want to be sure to do what my kind hosts most want.

k
itortunately, through
 
no fault of your own, it left me with a number of questions.
 
When Mrs. 1
(re4er invited me to the S4 meeting, she asked me t

sn't very specific, I wrote har diving

in, and she replied suggesting that I plan to present all three, s
ince there Voi1d
 
be a session on Saturday evening (possible) and on Sunday moruin  (for sure).
 
It seems from the program that the Saturday session has been el
.ixiii.t
.ed; in the
 
meanti m
e, Mrs. Krader wrote suggesting I plan to present both Pizza Pizza Daddy 0 -
-
a film an the traditional musical games of black urban children -
 and Bright

.8' each, so, w
i t
h your schedule, I
 
can't ass the possibility of shov ing  both.
 
I assume, also from the program, that Pizza has been the film of choice, but 1 do
 
want to confirm this with you so that I can be prepared with appropriate comment.
 
You say,  '
I was impress " by your abstract", which confuses me a trifle, since I
 
sent no abstract except a brief account or what was on each Li
la.  The point is that
 
if you want an account of the clapping practices I wrote Mrs. Xr.4.r about, Pizza

Either of the other tvo films, Bright Star or Buck Dancer wou l
d show adult complex

I

am glad to find there i

In any case, you sent me just the kind of information I needed, and
 
I thank you very much.  I enclose a copy of the prel6nAnary program, to
 
show you what we hope to do.  The Saturday evening session of films may
 
not work out, but we definitely would like you to show films on the

'erhaps that eliminates the one you are still working on

you will know better how it stands.  You could be free about which films

Dear Farbara,
 
Tha ks for your latest l
etter.  I was happy to note that all appears
 
to be shipshape for the Chapel hill meeting.
 
You .
asked for further subLestions and I ;
}ve one.  I saw Pess Loma-
,
 
Hawcs r
ecently at the AAA meeting and I learned more about the f
ascinntin€
:
 
res;arch she is doing on Sea I
slander music.  For s
ome tine  she has
 
s
}onsored a marvelous Sea I
slander group which performed this fall at
 
S.F. State.  They back up their singing/dancing w
ith fantastic polyrKythmic
 
and polytonal h
-
:
indelapping--they deliberately produce a low, middle and
 
high clapping tones.
 Frof. Hawes is currently doing a frame by frame
 
analysis of a film s
he made  of them, and I got the im- ression that s
he
 
is far enough along with her tesearch to give a paper(:  show the film? at
 
oub reeting. Asi�e from discussing the music ly s
e, she right choose
 
to stress h
er methodological technivues and pxobleys.
 
Could we fit her in to the existing profram, or. alternatively, bend
 
it a bit to accomodate her?
 Since I a
re weak on the musicological s
ide,
 
you ray :
wish to communicate with her direc Q :

Dear Fred L
ieberman:
 
I was p
leased to s
ee that you are to be program chairman f
or the SEM
 
meetings i
n San Francisco.  Are you planning to s
chedule any f
ilm
 
showings?  We've just f
inished a 20 minute black and white f
ilm
 
on an e
lderly M
issouri-born traditional f
iddler now resident in Los
 
Angeles t
itled "Say, Old Man, Can You P
lay the F
iddle?" (
after the
 
t
itle of one of h
is best tunes) that I
'd l
ike to show.  I
t i
s an
 
absolutely s
traight-forward unfancy footage of this o
ld gentleman
 
p
laying f
ive of h
is s
ongs and occasionally making remarks about his
 
views on s
tyle; my i
dea was take this relatively common-place musical
 
e
vent going on within a relatively ordinary urban setting and expose
 
the uncommon degree of e
xpertise and refinement involved.  He's a
 
whale of a f
iddler, and, a
s he says in the f
ilm, he hardly ever made
 
a dime a
t i
t.
 
I realize that southern white music i
s awfully declassee these days,
 
but i
n these parts i
t represents just as much of a minority cultural
 
s
tyle a
s does B
lack music.  Anyway, see what you think about i
t, and
 
if i
t would f
it i
n anywhere.  I
'd be glad to send you a preview copy
 
if that would be helpful.
 
By the way, did Alan ever see that marvellous S
ikhim footage of yours?
 
I
 wrote h
im about i
t.
 
Best wishes,
