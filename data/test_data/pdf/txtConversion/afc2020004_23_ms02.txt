Joe Dale Tate Nevaquaya:  I am Joe Dale Tate Nevaquaya. I am Yuchi on my mother’s side and 
Comanche on my father’s side. The title of the poem is “In the Field.”

JDTN:  Hopefully the imagery that’s provided through the words creates a sense of place—the 
use and the sound and the imagination of color, smell, creates a time, a place. When we 
remember place and time, it creates, within us all, a sense of isolation. So, in order to comfort 
that isolation, we go back to our words, our language, our memories, to give ourselves comfort, 
sustenance, resistance. To speak is resistance. To be a poet is to be resistant.  
 
The Yuchis were a very isolated language group and in living in these times, these places with 
their neighbors, there was war, there was counter-war, there was life and death, birth—all the 
things that imply as human beings, as isolates. And during the Removal, we were part of 
Andrew Jackson’s “Indian Problem” to be solved, and so when we left, we left—not just the 
Yuchis themselves but, the tribes had to leave everything behind, their homes, their love for the 
land, their ancestors’ homes, their graves, the waters, the sounds of the waters that nurtured 
them.  
 
As the poet, I feel like that I have that sense of dislocation and loss, and for me the recovery is 
through the language. There is a wonderful Yuchi language program that was implemented 
several years ago and has been a huge success, especially with the immersion program of the 
younger people. And as a former speaker of the Yuchi language, and learning the English 
language and the way to express myself, and the feeling of being Yuchi through the English 
language—it creates a surrealism for me. And so hopefully that feel of loss and recovery comes 
through the tone of the poem; the place comes through the poem; the arrangement of the 
words. The words may sound random, but they are carefully worked and reworked, and worked 
and reworked, such as a painting.  
 
We all know that we’ve lived through many, many, many millennia of time with the Earth, and 
from the Earth, and of the Earth, and so the beginning, you know, the fracturing of the Earth 
and the ice and the seasons that lasted for millennia—the Ice Age, things like the Mesozoic, 
those type of ages that geographica speaks of—has a wonderful language to it because it is of 
the land. The sense of glacials, for me, gives it a sense of timelessness, and yet moving and 
replacing the Earth with water, things of that nature.
