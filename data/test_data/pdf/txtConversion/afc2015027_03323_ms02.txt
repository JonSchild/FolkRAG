Christine Lewis interviews Lorna Robley 
Section 1 of 15 
[00:00:00 - 00:10:04] (NOTE: speaker names may be different in each section) 
Christine Lewis: 
Are we good? Again, my name is Christine Lewis doing this interview together 
with the Brooklyn Art Console, through the Archie Green grant for the archiving 
of the voices of domestic workers in the library of commerce. What is your 
name? 
Lorna Robley: 
My name is Lorna Robley. 
Christine Lewis: 
Should she speak up a little more? 
Chris Mul√©: 
It's okay, she's fine. 
Christine Lewis: 
What is your current occupation? 
Lorna Robley: 
I am presently a babysitter. 
Christine Lewis: 
[00:00:30] What borough or neighborhood do you live in? 
Lorna Robley: 
I live in the borough of Brooklyn. 
Christine Lewis: 
Where are you originally from? 
Lorna Robley: 
I am originally from Trinidad. 
Christine Lewis: 
What brought you to the United States? 
Lorna Robley: 
It was not to work. I came because my son wanted to pursue his education. 
[00:01:00] I decided after being in Trinidad and him here, I decided to come and 
join him. He came here at the age of 17. Presently he is an attorney because he 
decided after he wanted to be a lawyer, so he did that. I stayed, [00:01:30] 
because I used to sew at home in Trinidad. I was a seamstress. When my sister 
decided that she wanted to get married I came to do her wedding, and then my 
son said that he was getting married also. They said "Why do you want to go 
back home when you can stay here?" Someone introduced me to this woman 
that wanted a babysitter for her son, and so I decided to stay. I came into 
[00:02:00] working here in America as a babysitter for the past 20, 20 years, 21 
years. 
Christine Lewis: 
That answers the other question of how you became a domestic worker.

Lorna Robley: 
Yes. That is how I became a domestic worker. 
Christine Lewis: 
We kind of hate that word right?  
Lorna Robley: 
Yes, in a way. 
Christine Lewis: 
We struggle with the word. As you outline ... Caribbean people are prideful 
people. 
Lorna Robley: 
Yes we are. 
Christine Lewis: 
They send their children away to be educated. I could sense the pride in your 
voice and the joy in your voice and [00:02:30] we really wouldn't be doing this 
work, but situation and circumstance ... Our work is good work. It is good work. 
Lorna Robley: 
The whole point is, as I tell them, I do not have to be a domestic worker. Even if 
I choose to do the job of babysitting, I can't see why I'd have to be on a 
domesticated side as some of the people that you work for [00:03:00] prefer to 
make it, as if it's not a worthwhile to you. 
Christine Lewis: 
I hear you. 
Lorna Robley: 
Although you are taking care of the most important thing in their life, but in the 
end still they don't consider you to be anything. 
Christine Lewis: 
I'll help you to understand why that is the way it is. Because of the new deal and 
the injunction, and domestic workers being excluded from labor laws and the 
[00:03:30] inferiority of the job. Who did the job back in the 1930s, were black 
workers, slaves who did the work. 
Lorna Robley: 
Right. 
Christine Lewis: 
It has that connotation still up. It's all about a respectability factor. Domestic 
kind of puts an edge on it and the way the people, as you say, to use what you 
just said, the way the workers are treated in a low feared kind of a way, it puts a 
bite [00:04:00] on it. All that work is good work. Thanks for that. 
Lorna Robley: 
Oh yes. 
Christine Lewis: 
How long, and I think you said it before or you [inaudible 00:04:06] answer that 
question. How many positions have you had since you've been with the job? 
Lorna Robley: 
I do nanny. I do just the nanny part. I try to avoid doing any kind of 
domesticated work as they will see. Although sometimes [00:04:30] they might 
want you to help wash or to cook. I don't mind cooking because I love to cook.

Christine Lewis: 
Yes. I see that with your bread, your zucchini bread. Oh my God, that zucchini 
bread was something else. That gives it away right there, so I would like you to 
take care of me with food. 
Lorna Robley: 
Any job that I have, and I had a few already ... 
Christine Lewis: 
Did Chris have any of your zucchini bread? 
Lorna Robley: 
I don't know if he did. 
Chris: 
[inaudible 00:05:00]. 
Christine Lewis: 
Oh no. 
Lorna Robley: 
[00:05:00] Oh my goodness. 
Christine Lewis: 
You'll have to make another one so Chris can get some. Please? 
Lorna Robley: 
I promise. 
Christine Lewis: 
Everything we send up there, [inaudible 00:05:07] food so much. 
Lorna Robley: 
I don't make, although it is not part of my job description, but I choose to cook. 
Christine Lewis: 
You choose to cook? 
Lorna Robley: 
Yeah, I choose to cook. I was never ordered or said that I have to cook s part of 
my job, but I choose to cook [00:05:30] because I love to cook. Anything other 
than seeing about the children, that they tell themselves that I have to do, I 
make them understand that is not part of my job description. If you want to fire 
me, let me go, however you want to put it, is fine with me. 
Christine Lewis: 
With that said, walk me through a typical day routine on your job. What does 
that look [00:06:00] like? Walk me through from point A to Z if you [crosstalk 
00:06:05]. 
Lorna Robley: 
It varies because when I first started to work I used to do live in. Living in in 
people's houses is very difficult because you have a starting time, but you never 
have an ending time in some places. 
Christine Lewis: 
I hear you. That means what to be specific? 
Lorna Robley: 
Your starting to work sometimes from about 6:30 [00:06:30] in the morning. 
You have to be up because some of these children go to school from about 7:30. 
You have to get up to make sure they are up, get them ready. Then you have to 
get breakfast ready for them. The next thing with me is, I drive. It was not part 
of the, for the interview, that I have to drive, but you know as soon as they 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027

know you can do something it becomes [00:07:00] part of your job. As soon as 
you do it one time. Sometimes I might have to drop the children off to school, 
especially if something goes wrong with the bus and all of that. Then you come 
back now. Then you have to start to ... Once the children are out of the house 
they started to introduce you to "Do me a favor." They want you to do this. 
"Could you wash? Could you help me do this?" 
Christine Lewis: 
[00:07:30] Carry the shoe to the shoemaker. Carry the clothes to the laundry, to 
the dry cleaner, assist them, and drop it. 
Lorna Robley: 
"Could you go to the grocery?" There are some different errands that you have 
to run or do just because they know that you're in the house and the children 
aren't there. 
Christine Lewis: 
Let me ask you, what happens when you start to do that? If they ask you and do 
you that favor, what happens? Just the kind of [inaudible 00:07:58] they request 
in the answer. 
Lorna Robley: 
[00:08:00] The family becomes a job because after that every day or every other 
day they have something to ask you, a favor. It's always a favor. The word favor 
is always part of the job, part of asking you to do the particular ... What has 
happened with us, [00:08:30] I know with me, is you say "Okay, you aren't doing 
anything" and then your maternal instinct kind of kicks in and you tell yourself. 
"It's okay. I will do it", so you do it. There comes a point where you have to ask 
the question, "Is this my job or will I [00:09:00] be paid extra for doing these 
things?" Then the answer is no. 
 
One of the jobs I was in, when the child reached to go to school for [inaudible 
00:09:14], the mother told me that "Oh, you know, now that Karen is going to 
full time the husband said, the housekeeper doesn't need to come three times 
for the day. Maybe [00:09:30] you can take over doing ..." So I told her, I said 
"there's nothing wrong with work ..." as you said rightly just now. I said "there's 
nothing wrong with work, but I will not be living in because the child is going to 
school now, that means my job description will be changing. You don't need a 
babysitter anymore. You don't need a nanny. There's no reason for me to live 
in." 
Christine Lewis: 
[00:10:00] Right. 
Lorna Robley: 
"No, no, no. Nothing will change."

Lorna Robley: 
"No no no, nothing will change." I say, you need me to come and clean out? And 
then nothing will change. I said "No. I'm sorry, I will not be doing it." 
Christine Lewis: 
Okay. 
Lorna Robley: 
I said, so, "Come the end of the year, December month, I will be leaving." And I 
did just that.  
Christine Lewis: 
So what was your responsibility now? You did to their responsibility. 
Lorna Robley: 
Now this present time? 
Christine Lewis: 
Yes. 
Lorna Robley: 
This job that I am in? 
Christine Lewis: 
Yes. 
Lorna Robley: 
Which I've been in for 11 years. 
Christine Lewis: 
Okay. 
Lorna Robley: 
I [00:10:30] have to take a deep breath because- 
Christine Lewis: 
Oh, yi yi. 
Lorna Robley: 
I am presently working with an autistic boy child. 
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah. 
Lorna Robley: 
Part of two boys. I went, my job was, I went as when the little boy was a baby. I 
started with a baby. And I went for the interview, the mother said, "Oh, well I 
know, I have this other son I want you to meet." But he was just walk and 
[00:11:00] walk and walk. So I was like okay. My phone. My daughter. 
Speaker 3: 
If you need to get it, you can get it if you have to. If you need to answer it. 
Lorna Robley: 
I call you back [00:11:30] in the next 1/2 an hour. No.  
Voice on Phone: 
[inaudible 00:11:27] 
Lorna Robley: 
I'm doing something. Bye. 
Christine Lewis: 
I like your watch. Your watch very pretty.  
Lorna Robley: 
Yes.

Christine Lewis: 
What kid of watch you have Miss Nanny?  You talking it light up.  [inaudible 
00:11:43] Fancy. 
Lorna Robley: 
Thank you. 
Christine Lewis: 
Yes. 
Lorna Robley: 
I put it on mute. Yes. 
Christine Lewis: 
Yes, so yeah, you were talking about the autistic kid. 
Speaker 3: 
The one that walks. 
Christine Lewis: 
Yes. 
Lorna Robley: 
Yeah, he keeps walking and walking and I'm like okay. So [00:12:00] I waited 
around and then he came and then I saw, you know all these different 
movement of this child. So, I'm like okay, what's going on here. 
 
And it was short and then I left, that was I think a Tuesday. And then by the 
Sunday she was calling to ask me if I could start because her father died. So she 
would need me, yeah know, to come in the Monday. You know they are 
[00:12:30] Jews so the burial was Monday. So, I, that's how I started my job with 
this family. And it has been a journey with this boy child at the age of 6 he was. 
Because I never knew anything about autism.  
 
She never said that he was autistic. So at least I would have you know 
researched it or ask a question, because there are members of my family 
[00:13:00] who was in the profession, that I could have you know said 
something about it. It wasn't until a fellow Trin Island babysitter that I met. 
 
And then I was telling her and then the school that he used to go to, I when I 
mentioned the school to her, because she used to work in Manhattan, she said, 
"Lorna, he is autistic." 
Christine Lewis: 
Okay. 
Lorna Robley: 
I said, "Autistic?" Oh, she said, "You ever seen the movie Rain Man?"  
 
I said, "Yes!" She said, "Well, want to look at it again?" And [00:13:30] that is the 
child that you are looking at. And that is how I realized, you know that.  So it has 
had its challenges. And then the mother, she is a corporate lawyer, so she 
always out of the house so there are times that I have to be there with him, by 
both of them. Living in again, with them, well I said I didn't want to but this was 
different. 
Domestic Workers United

[00:14:00] But it was just when she's away that I have to be there helping out. 
And it was very challenging. 
Christine Lewis: 
Oh, how so do, tell me. Tell me, tell me, with this autistic boy and his brother 
that you just mentioned, the other kid, what is that like do? Give me- 
Lorna Robley: 
The brother is, he is okay. 
Christine Lewis: 
Yes. 
Lorna Robley: 
But the autistic one, is an experience [00:14:30] that I think I would like other 
babysitters to see. And to work with especially you know at least this him, he is 
verbal. 
Christine Lewis: 
He's verbal? 
Lorna Robley: 
Yes. He is verbal, but there are times when it's difficult. You know, he, when he 
kinda express himself he would bang his head. He [00:15:00] can't take noises, 
like certain dog barking. Like it has an effect on him. So you always have to be 
watching him. You don't know, he can't understand directions. So like we go out 
on the street, he doesn't know if to stop, if to stop to see if a car is coming. He 
will keep walking. 
 
So he has no form of, [00:15:30] is direction the right word to use? Because you 
will be coming towards like a whole group of people. And he will just keep 
walking. 
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah, direction. He doesn't have a right sense of direction. 
Lorna Robley: 
You know somebody, you know when you're walking you will move, shift your 
body to ... no, he doesn't- 
Christine Lewis: 
He can't articulate there? 
Lorna Robley: 
No. So he will walk right into you. You know just, last week I think, we were 
coming from I think something he had in his school, [00:16:00] and it was the 
same thing he did with a gentleman, he walked right onto the man. We were 
going down some steps to go to the house, back to their room and he bumped 
straight into the man. The man phone dropped, yeah know. And, as a reaction, 
as I was telling the brother, I said, yeah know a reaction like that somebody just 
dropping on your back, your first thing reaction is to raise your hand, [00:16:30] 
because you are telling yourself somebody is coming, you know, to attack you. 
Christine Lewis: 
Attack you.  
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027

Lorna Robley: 
You know? So as the man spin around, with a fist first, because I was on top of 
him and not attacking him and he realize that. So I have to apologize, I always 
have to be apologizing for him. You know, for his behavior. 
 
For the past 2 years he has this, he has he and his maturity was in a conflict. So 
he was [00:17:00] there you know on the train, in the park- 
Christine Lewis: 
Doing what? 
Lorna Robley: 
With his penis. 
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah? 
Lorna Robley: 
Yes. And his penis was, and you're seeing it. 
Christine Lewis: 
Okay, and you're beside him? 
Lorna Robley: 
Yeah, I'm there! 
Christine Lewis: 
So, so what do you do? So what is your daily, and I understand that he is 
autistic, what is mandated of you to do with him going through all that he is 
going through, knowing that he is a special needs child? And which brings 
another question [00:17:30] to me. You're the caregiver to this babysitter, 
domestic worker if you may, to this child, without an education in special needs- 
Lorna Robley: 
That's right. 
Christine Lewis: 
For clearly this is a special needs child. 
Lorna Robley: 
That he is. 
Christine Lewis: 
So I'm curious, the final, what you, you, you Lorna do with this kid on a day to 
day. How do you maneuver? I want to get into your head on a day to day work 
with this kid. 
Lorna Robley: 
It is- 
Christine Lewis: 
With all that he is doing. 
Lorna Robley: 
It is very difficult. 
Christine Lewis: 
[00:18:00] Yeah. 
Lorna Robley: 
You know you have to- 
Christine Lewis: 
What is your time waking up for him? 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027

Lorna Robley: 
Six in the morning. 
Christine Lewis: 
So, you live in or you practically live out. 
Lorna Robley: 
No, I live out. 
Christine Lewis: 
You live out? 
Lorna Robley: 
But there are times as I say, when the mother is not there. 
Christine Lewis: 
Yes. 
Lorna Robley: 
That I have to be there. And she travels. 
Christine Lewis: 
And you're up by 6 o'clock. 
Lorna Robley: 
6 o'clock. Yes, I put an alarm at 6. 
Christine Lewis: 
My Lord. So when you get up at 6, what you doing at 6 o'clock? 
Lorna Robley: 
My, I have to start to prepare him now for school. After I do his breakfast, 
[00:18:30] then I have to do his lunch. 
Christine Lewis: 
And his brother? 
Lorna Robley: 
And his brother. But the brother is off at eight. So at least I have, you know, I 
have a half an hour after he leaves.  
Christine Lewis: 
Wow. 
Lorna Robley: 
That I can just drink some coffee, take a deep breath and then do the brother. 
 
But he is a little bit more difficult. 
Christine Lewis: 
Of course. 
Lorna Robley: 
Because, for instance, if the bus runs late, that is a problem. 
Christine Lewis: 
[00:19:00] In the sense? 
Lorna Robley: 
Because he will keep pacing, the bus, the bus, where is my bus? Where is my 
bus? Where is the bus? So he would keep going. 
Christine Lewis: 
And do you respond? What is your? 
Lorna Robley: 
Tell him, "Max, your bus is late because the bus might have problem." 
Domestic Workers United

Christine Lewis: 
Yes. 
Lorna Robley: 
But he don't understand that. 
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah. 
Lorna Robley: 
He will not understand that. 
Christine Lewis: 
Wow. 
Lorna Robley: 
So you can tell him the bus is running late because the bus has a problem. 
[00:19:30] The bus is running late because there is traffic. The bus is running late 
because maybe snow, it snowed.  
 
No, nothing works. And he will just keep pacing and pacing and pacing and 
talking about his bus. Until they either call on my phone and say they're 
downstairs or the doorman say Max's bus is there. 
 
Then there's the time of day, [00:20:00] well back to the story. It doesn't matter 
where he is. 
Section 2 of 15 
[00:10:00 - 00:20:04] 
Section 3 of 15 
[00:20:00 - 00:30:04] (NOTE: speaker names may be different in each section) 
Lorna Robley: 
Well back to the story. It doesn't matter where he is and he will tell him. We 
were going out today because he was home and I say, "I'm not staying any 
house with him," because that's the next story. I say, "Okay we will go out." I 
said, "Listen to me, we are going to go for the train, but we get on the train I 
don't want you to talk about your penis," Because he and his penis, as my mom 
tell me, "He's a man." 
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah, he understands [00:20:30] that though? 
Lorna Robley: 
I don't think so. 
Christine Lewis: 
Okay. Like a baby though, like a baby who's exploring. 
Lorna Robley: 
Yes. 
Christine Lewis: 
You know babies explore, right? Their penis they touch. 
Lorna Robley: 
He has a mind of, I think, a five year old in a 17 year old body right now. 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027

Christine Lewis: 
Okay. How old is his younger brother? 
Lorna Robley: 
He's 10 going on 11. 
Christine Lewis: 
Okay. Oh lord. Your hands full. I know- 
Lorna Robley: 
I have us to make an announcement in the train. 
Christine Lewis: 
Really? 
Lorna Robley: 
Yes. I had no choice. 
Christine Lewis: 
To say what? 
Lorna Robley: 
"Excuse me ladies and gentlemen [00:21:00] but right now he has autism and he 
and his penis is having a little problem." 
Christine Lewis: 
Lorna. You did that? 
Lorna Robley: 
Yes, I did. I had no choice because he was just holding, grabbing, pulling at it and 
talking about it and everybody was, you know. 
Christine Lewis: 
Of course. 
Lorna Robley: 
This is a tall ... he's tall. 
Christine Lewis: 
Okay. I was about to ask you his height.  
Lorna Robley: 
He's very tall.  
Christine Lewis: 
[00:21:30] Looks like a young man. 
Lorna Robley: 
He looks, yes, handsome young man. Looking at him, you will not believe 
anything is wrong with him. You see somebody like that come in and standing 
up and grabbing their, and pulling and ... Everybody start moving away and want 
to know some people running this direction, moving to that direction. I have his 
little brother. The little brother, he walks with a book everywhere we go. 
Christine Lewis: 
Because of that you [00:22:00] think? 
Lorna Robley: 
Yes. As we sit in the train, he buries his head in his book. He blocks him off 
completely because it is very shameful. Then as I tell him, I say, you know. 
Christine Lewis: 
He's a special need kid. 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027

Lorna Robley: 
What I am saying is this. [Inaudible 00:22:21], I believe that if I said, I don't want 
you to do this, I think he should know that he's not supposed [00:22:30] to do it. 
Sometimes I want to know if he deliberately does it. 
Christine Lewis: 
Then he's a little kid, a juve ... 
Lorna Robley: 
Because if you tell a five year old child, "Don't touch that," or "Don't go there" 
and they still go there, then that means that. I think there is some form of 
direction that they're supposed to understand that you're not supposed to do. I 
said not to do it and you're not supposed [00:23:00] to do it. He will continue 
doing it, and making you know that he's doing it. Sometimes I will ... if he's in 
the house with me, he will do things to draw my attention to him. I will 
deliberately turn my back for him. 
Christine Lewis: 
Let me stop you, but this is a kid who's autistic, who you have to be watching 
24/7. How [00:23:30] does that impact you because you're in the house with 
him pacing now. You don't want him to pace through the window, you don't 
want him to pace and knock his head, because that it tremors, it becomes pretty 
rigorous. 
Lorna Robley: 
As you say window. I had just started to work with him. They were moving from 
one house to the other. We moved to the 3rd Avenue and 38th Street. We're on 
the 47th floor. I came in the morning, the father is telling me, [00:24:00] "I don't 
want you to ... I want you to stop Max from jumping on the windowsill." I'm 
looking at him, I said, "Excuse me what are you talking about?" "Oh he jumped 
from the ... he went up on the kitchen counter, and jumped over to the 
windowsill." I said, "He didn't do that. I have no idea what you're talking about 
because he never did it with me."  
Christine Lewis: 
He doesn't do it with you, yeah.   
Lorna Robley: 
They are [00:24:30] furious with me as if I know what they are speaking about. I 
said, "Okay." The both of them left and they went to work. When he came 
home in the evening, I said, "Max, I need you to show me what it is you did 
when you jumped in the windowsill." Oh he made a big grin on his face and he 
climbed up on the kitchen counter. He leaped over to the windowsill. Forty-
seven floors, a window [00:25:00] like that. 
Christine Lewis: 
Oh my god. I've got bay windows.  
Lorna Robley: 
I said, "Excuse me." I said, "Do you know you're not supposed to do that?" I said, 
"No, that is unacceptable." 
Christine Lewis: 
How old he was when he was doing that? 
Lorna Robley: 
About eight years, going on nine.  
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027

Christine Lewis: 
He's very spiry at eight, springy.  
Lorna Robley: 
Yeah, but the point of the matter is this. They [00:25:30] see their child doing it. 
Why didn't you tell him not to do it? Why did you come to me to tell me to stop 
him from doing it? 
Christine Lewis: 
When he was doing it with them.  
Lorna Robley: 
Exactly so. There were many things that he was doing with them, that he was 
not doing with me and they will never ... they will tell me about it sometime 
after the fact. Another time I'm going with the both of them, a little one in 
[00:26:00] the stroller and him holding the stroller. We reached crossing the 
street, thank god that I waited for the light. We reached to the middle of the 
street and he run right back ... 
Christine Lewis: 
On the other side. 
Lorna Robley: 
Let go of the stroller and went right back on the other side.  
Christine Lewis: 
Oh my lord.  
Lorna Robley: 
I froze. I'm like, "What?" I'm screaming at him now to come back. He run back 
and hold [00:26:30] the stroller and he did it again. He run ... 
Christine Lewis: 
Right back. 
Lorna Robley: 
In the middle of the street.  
Christine Lewis: 
Go back to the other side.  
Lorna Robley: 
Christine. Yes. You know when I mentioned it to the mother, the mother told 
me that's how he did it to her and you never said that to me so at least I would 
have an idea or look out for that. 
Christine Lewis: 
Considering that you're the baby sitter and not a special need teacher. 
Lorna Robley: 
Yes, that's right. Who maybe knew about these things.  
Christine Lewis: 
Or prepare you to be because [00:27:00] it's two defining jobs. A special need 
teacher and I did special need with [inaudible 00:27:07] so I understand that, 
but it's clearly two different definition of jobs here.  
Lorna Robley: 
Yes it is.  
Christine Lewis: 
You're giving care to a child and you have to be the special needs teacher 
without any specific training.

Lorna Robley: 
That's right.  
Christine Lewis: 
Or know-it-all for them to say, "Well he's autistic and this is what you have to 
watch out for or be careful of." How did that make you feel? Because you 
cannot sit on with an autistic child in the room [00:27:30] and let that child go 
haywire. You have to ...  
Lorna Robley: 
Listen.  
Christine Lewis: 
While you have other things to focus on because you have to cook, prepare to 
go out and meet the other kid. For me, it's [crosstalk 00:27:41] 
Lorna Robley: 
Listen, it was because I ended up in the hospital the first year I worked for these 
people.  
Christine Lewis: 
Oh my god. With what? 
Lorna Robley: 
Well first they said it was anxiety attack.  
Christine Lewis: 
Okay a panic attack.  
Lorna Robley: 
Yes. I thought it was my heart. [00:28:00] I thought I was getting a heart attack. 
Christine Lewis: 
I see. 
Lorna Robley: 
I tell him call the ambulance ... I call my son, he tell me, "Open the door, unlock 
the door, the ambulance on the way." They came, they took me in to the 
hospital, run all the tests and everything and they decided it was not a heart 
attack. It was an anxiety attack brought on by all of that anxiety in my body 
because of this child.  
Christine Lewis: 
It was your first year? 
Lorna Robley: 
Yes.  
Christine Lewis: 
The first year's the ...  
Lorna Robley: 
First year.  
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah, it's trying. It's [00:28:30] trying. I could understand how trying that is 
because the parents' on your back, you really don't have the know it all.  
Lorna Robley: 
I started the work in September and in January of the next year, the first day in 
January of the following year, I was in the hospital. Within one year.  
Christine Lewis: 
You every step of this child move from point A to B, you behind this child at the 
B point.

Lorna Robley: 
Listen, they will not let him off the bus [00:29:00] unless I am standing in front 
of their face. They will not let him off the bus and he's 17 years old now. That 
has been happening from since I started work there. It will be 11 years just now.  
Christine Lewis: 
I am curious about the penis story, why? Because here it is a 17 year old kid 
who's pulling at his penis. He doesn't really have any semblance of sense right 
now, right? [00:29:30] Why would they employ you to go on the train with this 
kid? You know what I'm saying? Why you have to make this public ... 
Lorna Robley: 
I told ... 
Christine Lewis: 
Announcement ... 
Lorna Robley: 
The mother ... 
Christine Lewis: 
It's not fair to you ... 
Lorna Robley: 
No, it isn't.  
Christine Lewis: 
And the passengers on the train.  
Lorna Robley: 
No, it isn't.  
Christine Lewis: 
Who don't understand that this is a sick kid. This is a special need kid, right? A 
mentally challenged kid or [inaudible 00:29:48] whatever the word is.  
Lorna Robley: 
Yeah because he looks normal.  
Christine Lewis: 
I want to be politically correct. Of course, sickness doesn't have a look or mental 
issues doesn't have a look. Autism doesn't have a look. Here it is, you're on a 
bus, a crowded train with passengers, [00:30:00] who doesn't know. I think it's 
so unfair to you the caregiver

Lorna Robley: 
That's right.  
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027

Christine Lewis: 
To stand up and give this public announcement. Why? What would your mother 
say? Why didn't they pay for taxi or a cab service for you to shuttle him from A 
to B? 
Lorna Robley: 
I told them about it, but it doesn't have to happen to her, because most of the 
time, when they are going anywhere, that's what they do. They take taxi. 
Christine Lewis: 
Okay. Wow. 
Lorna Robley: 
But when I have to ... I was going, and most of the time is when, [00:30:30] 
because the parents are separated now, so most of the time now is on a Friday, 
the trains are crowded at four o'clock in the evening. 
Christine Lewis: 
Yes. Rush hour.  
Lorna Robley: 
I'm on the train with these two kids, fighting train traffic, to take them to meet 
their father.  
Christine Lewis: 
And having to handle this kid in a special way. 
Lorna Robley: 
In Wall Street. They are not hand to mouth people. They are not people who- 
Christine Lewis: 
Lived in abject poverty, if you mean. 
Lorna Robley: 
Yes.  
Christine Lewis: 
They [00:31:00] have money. 
Lorna Robley: 
Yes.  
Christine Lewis: 
The wealth.  
Lorna Robley: 
They are. 
Christine Lewis: 
The woman is a corporate lawyer, right? 
Lorna Robley: 
Yes. They are wealthy. The father works on Wall Street.  
Christine Lewis: 
Okay. Wow. 
Lorna Robley: 
They can do better but you tell them about it and everybody looks at you with a 
blank look on your face. 
Christine Lewis: 
Have you ever told them the embarrassment that had causes on the train where 
people shift to the side? 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
16
Lorna Robley: 
Oh yes. You know, it's not until it happens to them, then ... When it does 
happen to them, [00:31:30] they want to ... They blame me. It happened to the 
father in Florida on the beach. He blamed me. He called me to ask me why it 
was happening.  
Christine Lewis: 
They're not realizing that the kid is autistic? 
Lorna Robley: 
Yeah. 
Christine Lewis: 
I mean I sat in a room with an autistic kid. We went to an event and clearly, he 
was doing the same thing. My friend and I looked at each other and we said, 
"Oh my god. Look, the boy fluchen us." When you look at the [00:32:00] kid, you 
know that the kid - 
Lorna Robley: 
They realize something is ... 
Christine Lewis: 
You can tell. You go, "No, no. My kid said sudden fingers themselves." I'm 
looking and so I can imagine ... I mean, as the caregiver. 
Lorna Robley: 
Yep. It's so different. 
Christine Lewis: 
You're not the parent though. 
Lorna Robley: 
That's right. 
Christine Lewis: 
The humiliation of it as the caregiver and having to carry it to me. I'm listening 
to that story and I'm feeling giddy about it because as the caregiver, who you 
are is a burden on your shoulder. This child is not your child but [00:32:30] here 
it is. You're making a public announcement to a train and all in-sundry, that this 
kid is fingering ... Playing with his penis on the train. It's not your son and you go 
to tell his mother. My lord. You go to tell his mother who turns the blind eye or 
looks the other way. 
Lorna Robley: 
I don't know why I'm getting emotional right now [inaudible 00:32:57]. 
Christine Lewis: 
The indignity, [00:33:00] the indignity. It's okay. That's why you're telling your 
story. 
Lorna Robley: 
Because sometimes it is so unfair. 
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah. It is though. I'm listening to you to tell this story and it's giddy in me 
because if anything was to go wrong as a caregiver myself, with this kid, there is 
no amount to see what that the authorities could. I just had a story [00:33:30] 
with Doreen about the ACS. 
Lorna Robley: 
I had it with him. 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
17
Christine Lewis: 
For what? 
Lorna Robley: 
He said that I hit him. With the same story, with the window. Yeah, and I 
recently had it. 
Christine Lewis: 
Again? 
Lorna Robley: 
Well, no. He brought it up now to a new school he's going to because of his age. 
He started to tell him that I hit him with a wood spoon, [00:34:00] so they came 
to investigate me. 
Christine Lewis: 
[inaudible 00:34:06] Why stay? Why stay? Why stay? 
Lorna Robley: 
Because I have no idea. There's a connection with me and him. 
Christine Lewis: 
Okay I see. Yeah. Yeah, you see that's why ... I'm going to stop you. That's what 
makes it difficult as a caregiver, [00:34:30] and I think I said it before in another 
interview. When you bond with this kid, they kind of could do no wrong. It's 
what you call an agape love, especially, but you're right. I think it's the care 
[inaudible 00:34:45]. 
Lorna Robley: 
I think it was because of my son. The first time this thing happened to me when 
I ended up in hospital and I told my son that I was leaving. He told me don't do 
it. 
Christine Lewis: 
He told you don't leave. 
Lorna Robley: 
Yeah. 
Christine Lewis: 
[00:35:00] What was his reason for telling you don't leave? 
Lorna Robley: 
Because he met him, I think, two times. You know, he said ... My son is the type 
of person to that [inaudible 00:35:13]. I don't know, but he said don't leave him. 
Christine Lewis: 
Kind of like from a brotherly ... 
Lorna Robley: 
Then I went ... They had something [00:35:30] a time and I think it was to my 
granddaughter. They had a ... Something who they invited me to. I took my 
granddaughter. She didn't know. She was, I think, about five years. She's seen 
this big boy. Didn't have much to run into place so she knew that I work with 
him. She tried to go and play with him. 
Christine Lewis: 
Of course. Our kids bond [00:36:00] with their kids. 
Lorna Robley: 
Well you know, in  [inaudible 00:36:01] they don't bond with people. 
Christine Lewis: 
Right. 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
18
Lorna Robley: 
They don't bond with children. 
Christine Lewis: 
Okay. 
Lorna Robley: 
So he keep running away from her. 
Christine Lewis: 
Of course. Right. 
Lorna Robley: 
She went and she told the father. 
Christine Lewis: 
Her father? 
Lorna Robley: 
She told his father. 
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah. 
Lorna Robley: 
The guy I'm working ... The child. Max's father. That she's trying to play with him 
and he keeps running away. The man came to me and he was telling me. He 
said, "Imagine this dinner. My son ..." And tears was in his eyes. 
Christine Lewis: 
The father? 
Lorna Robley: 
[00:36:30] Yes. "That my son has this beautiful young woman trying to talk with 
him and play with him and he keeps running away with him, from him, from 
her." You know, because he doesn't know better. 
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah. His [inaudible 00:36:47] is not there. 
Lorna Robley: 
You know, so after this thing happened, my son told me, "No, don't leave 
them." 
Christine Lewis: 
Knowing that you haven't endured this with your [00:37:00] ... You have one kid 
right? 
Lorna Robley: 
Nope. Two children I have. 
Christine Lewis: 
Two children, and you haven't endured this. You leave your children, right? 
Whatever it is. Grown and they become who they become in society. The care 
for some people now, and the indignity, the injustice that moves you to tears ... 
I feel it too. I get goosebumps because it's so much to do, especially special 
needs job. It's not an easy job. Let's face it. You're not qualified though. 
Lorna Robley: 
No, that's the thing. I had the opportunity to be and she [00:37:30] ... You know 
the usual thing. The time that you have to go to class and it was at his school. 
They give you the opportunity as a caregiver to come in and do this seminar, 
this class. The hours you're suppose to go there, she find in time something for 
you to do. 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
19
Christine Lewis: 
She fill in that time. 
Lorna Robley: 
Within that hour, within that time. 
Christine Lewis: 
So you shouldn't educate yourself? 
Lorna Robley: 
Yes, so I will not educate myself and get that certificate that says, "Yes, 
[00:38:00] you are certified in that special needs group." 
Christine Lewis: 
To be able to assist him. 
Lorna Robley: 
Yes because it was going to ... It was a similar thing like this. You know, you do 
the class and then they come and interview you now with the child. What you 
do with the child on a daily basis. 
Christine Lewis: 
I see. 
Lorna Robley: 
Then they certify you. I just shake my head and yeah. 
Christine Lewis: 
[00:38:30] That's why I ask you. You give the reasoning. That‚Äôs why I ask you 
why you stay. I walked off a job. Detention and stress of the job. I just ran it and 
walk off jobs because it wasn't worth my stress or my sanity. I'm telling you. 
People talk about giving care, giving care on any level is not easy. I don't care if 
you're working on Wall Street and I have to come home to care for your family. I 
don't care what job you're doing to come home and care for your family. 
Especially when families have special needs. [00:39:00] Listen. It's not easy to 
have a baby crying in your arm and then to help nurture the little one whose, 
"Mommy, mommy, mommy" as an alternate parent. It's not the easiest thing. I 
know what I feel when that baby cries and that baby cry, because you're holding 
that baby and nothing pacifies the baby. 
Lorna Robley: 
No. 
Christine Lewis: 
Much less walking behind the special need kid who you have to ... And you have 
to be careful. 
Lorna Robley: 
He used to wake up all over the night. You [00:39:30] know, you're sleeping. You 
get up and you're asleep because like ... I do not sleep when I'm on my job. 
Christine Lewis: 
Oh gosh. 
Lorna Robley: 
I do not sleep, so that's when I was ... I was there last week because she went 
away. The first thing I do when I ... On the Sunday morning, I went to do a 
massage because I just needed to release that tension. He used to wake up and 
put on all the lights in the house. 
Christine Lewis: 
That waking up time [00:40:00] is what time?

You don't have a good quality of sleep? 
Christine Lewis: 
Nope, nope, nope, nope.

Lorna Robley: 
Wow. 
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah. 
Lorna Robley: 
Talk about the ACS, let's visit the ACS. When the ACS people come, the Child 
Protective Services came to you, what became of that? Because we were just 
talking about at the last interview how long and drawn out that must be. 
Christine Lewis: 
He came [inaudible 00:40:59], because when [00:41:00] the guy came, he spoke 
to the mother and the father first. Well, the father is not living in the house, but 
the mother called the father and told the father, so he came in. 
Lorna Robley: 
Yeah. 
Christine Lewis: 
[inaudible 00:41:14] We like a brother and a sister. You know you and your 
brother just butt heads? 
Lorna Robley: 
Yup. 
Christine Lewis: 
Well that is me and him. 
Lorna Robley: 
Yup. 
Christine Lewis: 
He came, he hugged me, he said everything going to be okay, I said of course. 
[00:41:30] He talked with her, then the people came. They interviewed the two 
of them.  
Lorna Robley: 
Yeah. 
Christine Lewis: 
I went into one of the rooms with the boys, then he came out. Then he came 
and he asked ... He talked to them. Well I know the other one, he kept asking, 
because the guy, when he came in the door, he rung the doorbell, [inaudible 
00:41:50] opened the door. Regardless of where he is, he reach the door first. 
You could be right here [00:42:00] and answer the door, and he reach out and 
open it. 
Lorna Robley: 
Yeah, he's before you. 
Christine Lewis: 
First thing he asked the man, what's your name? And the man tell him, and the 
man was kind of, you know. How did you come here? What car did you use? 
Yeah, he asked a lot of questions. 
Lorna Robley: 
Okay yeah, they do too, uh-huh. 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027

Christine Lewis: 
The man asked him well, what is that to him. He was [00:42:30] like [inaudible 
00:42:32] didn't even know he was autistic. 
Lorna Robley: 
He must've thought he was a precautious little boy. 
Christine Lewis: 
That's when he realized after, the mother [inaudible 00:42:39] and tell him Max, 
it's okay. That's when the man was kind of ...  
Lorna Robley: 
Really? 
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah. 
Lorna Robley: 
Okay. 
Christine Lewis: 
He came on in, talking to both of them, and then after he came he called me. 
The first thing I ask him is do I need an attorney? Because I had already called 
my son and tell him. He told me well, when he start [00:43:00] to ask question 
just put the phone on, but then after I didn't bother, because I realized I didn't 
do anything, I didn't have anything to hide. 
Lorna Robley: 
Okay, no, okay. 
Christine Lewis: 
He came in. I was ... You, time for you to go and take a shower. You go and take 
a ... I was doing my job. 
Lorna Robley: 
Yes, as usual. 
Christine Lewis: 
As usual, because I know I didn't have anything to hide, I did not do anything 
wrong. 
Lorna Robley: 
Good for you. 
Christine Lewis: 
Then he said I understand that you are the babysitter. I [00:43:30] said okay. I'm 
listening to him. I'm answering, but I'm listening. I said babysitter. Yeah, well I 
understand that all you do is collect them after school when school [inaudible 
00:43:48]. I said is that so? He said you are not the babysitter? I said well if they 
say so. I say but, I am here [00:44:00] from 7 in the morning to whatever clock in 
the night sometimes. Sometimes I am here because the mother travels. If you 
want to call that a babysitting job, then I'm the babysitter. 
Lorna Robley: 
Okay, wow. 
Christine Lewis: 
I say but I'm the jack of all trades and master of none. He look at me. No, I want 
him to know that I am no fool. 
Lorna Robley: 
Of course not, right.

Christine Lewis: 
You know? I said my son is an attorney, so I spoke to [00:44:30] him, so I need 
to know. Him, oh we cannot, because of my son he wouldn't be able to talk to 
him as an attorney, but if I want to ... You could talk to him after. I said well fine, 
I'll give you his phone number after. Then I told him exactly what happened. 
What went down, what happens during the day, and all of that. He said okay, 
then he left. He came back one [00:45:00] time after that, like a surprise, they 
come to catch you off guard kind of thing. 
Lorna Robley: 
Oh yeah. Oh, okay. Wow. 
Christine Lewis: 
So what, he came in the house and observe you? They came in the house and 
observed you? 
Lorna Robley: 
Yeah he came, the guy came back a day. [inaudible 00:45:20] so he came up. 
Doorbell rang, I open it, it was him. Come in. 
Christine Lewis: 
Nothing to hide. 
Lorna Robley: 
No. I just tell him, I say [inaudible 00:45:29] [00:45:30] . Then the next time I 
heard from him is when he came back to tell me that everything was squashed 
because they didn't find any. It was like about six months. 
Christine Lewis: 
Six months they came to look at you? 
Lorna Robley: 
No, six months ... He came twice. Well three times. The first day he came, then 
he came back again, then he came to say everything- 
Christine Lewis: 
Okay. 
Lorna Robley: 
It took about six months. 
Christine Lewis: 
Okay, I [00:46:00] see what you're saying. 
Lorna Robley: 
I have no idea if there was ... 
Christine Lewis: 
Just the things you hear. I would never even think this. 
Lorna Robley: 
I don't know if there was doing school observation or something like that. 
Christine Lewis: 
Could be, too. 
Lorna Robley: 
I just stay away from him. I tell the mother, I said I will work with him, but at the 
same time I am not doing [00:46:30] too much close contact. I know he doesn't 
really understand what he was doing or anything like that, but because he likes 
to talk. He talks a lot. He hears ... If he knows your voice, Christine, and you call 
me, or I call you and we are talking on [inaudible 00:46:59], he will ask me for 
you.

[00:47:00] Okay, interesting though.

Very. 
Christine Lewis: 
He's not that one who goes ahh. He has that moment when he goes ahh. 
Because it seems articulate. Interesting.  
Lorna Robley: 
Yes. 
Christine Lewis: 
He talks, he carries a conversation. 
Lorna Robley: 
[inaudible 00:47:20] is Christine on the phone? 
Christine Lewis: 
Really? Amazing. 
Lorna Robley: 
Yeah, I was talking with this friend of mine Michelle, [00:47:30] but he know 
Michelle because we used to do play dates. I got the job for her because it was 
her friend, my [inaudible 00:47:42] friend had wanted somebody. That day I was 
talking to Michelle on the phone, and he came and asked me to talk to Michelle. 
Christine Lewis: 
Interesting. 
Lorna Robley: 
I took a deep breath. I say Michelle [inaudible 00:47:56]. Yes. 
Christine Lewis: 
My Lord. 
Lorna Robley: 
I say Max want to talk to you. [00:48:00] She what? [inaudible 00:48:03] on the 
phone. 
Christine Lewis: 
Wow. This is heavy. This is a story [inaudible 00:48:12]. You needed to exhale. 
Lorna Robley: 
I needed to exhale, so as soon as ... It was around December when they came, 
the guy came and he told me everything, I said bye. I call my daughter [inaudible 
00:48:30] get me on a flight [00:48:30] to Trinidad. 
Christine Lewis: 
Your daughter's in Trinidad? 
Lorna Robley: 
No, I call her here and tell her get a flight for me. 
Christine Lewis: 
I see. After that.

Lorna R.: 
Some of this ... There's things that he will do and say. 
Christine L.:

... 
Christine L.: 
Yeah. 
Lorna R.: 
First time I'm meeting her, his psychologist, or whatever they call it. 
Christine L.: 
Yeah.

Lorna R.: 
So I am dreading- 
Christine L.: 
I hear you. 
Lorna R.: 
[00:56:00] Because now he is a little more older.  
Christine L.: 
I mean it's nothing to laugh, we said through the bad things. Yes we're laughing. 
And yeah, I see. 
Lorna R.: 
I know. But I'm seeing signs of that behavior pattern, starting to come in ...  
Christine L.: 
Again.  
Lorna R.: 
Again. 
Christine L.: 
Yeah.  
Lorna R.: 
Yes. 
Christine L.: 
Do you think-

He is regressing back to ... like with the things from like since he was ten years 
old ... 
Christine L.: 
[00:56:30] Yes.

"It's funny. Laughing is funny. Kid, kid. Gosh, gosh." 
Christine L.: 
It really is funny. 
Lorna R.: 
And then his voice starts to get- 
Christine L.: 
[00:57:00] Loud. 
Lorna R.: 
Loud. 
Christine L.: 
I see.  
Lorna R.: 
Like if he close the door?

Christine L.: 
Yeah, yeah.  
Lorna R.: 
Yeah, I have family members who are afraid for me. 
Christine L.: 
Yeah. I would imagine. 
Lorna R.: 
Especially when you living in-story, and when you sleeping [crosstalk 00:57:54]- 
Christine L.: 
Yeah, yeah. Those things. Yeah. 
Lorna R.: 
I said, "I don't sleep." 
Christine L.: 
Okay.  
Lorna R.: 
That is the only thing that is bothering me. 
Christine L.: 
And that could be the stress. [00:58:00] That could be the nervous thing- 
Lorna R.: 
Yes. 
Christine L.: 
Because you need ... It's a ... 
Lorna R.: 
That's the only thing that is bothering me.

Your job is a just a high tension job. 
Lorna R.: 
Yes.  
Christine L.: 
It is. 
male speaker: 
Mm-hmm (affirmative). 
Christine L.:

Lorna R.: 
That's what my doctor told me.

As you say, your son tell you to stay, and I don't know why. What? Why? 
Lorna R.: 
I don't know. 
Christine L.: 
Is it that it's giving you something to do? 
Lorna R.: 
No. I mean ... 
Christine L.: 
Okay. 
Lorna R.: 
I could sew. 
Christine L.: 
I know. I mean you could bake. You could cook. I know. I mean, [00:58:30] 
people want clothes. 
Lorna R.: 
People keep asking me.  
Christine L.: 
I know. 
Lorna R.: 
What ... 
Christine L.: 
Wow. No, so that's my point. Is it giving you something to do, work-wise? You 
know, because you could be retired.  
Lorna R.: 
Yeah. 
Christine L.: 
You could be retired woman, not so? 
Lorna R.: 
I have job interviews that I went on already. 
Christine L.: 
Okay.  
Lorna R.: 
And- 
Christine L.:

Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
37
Lorna R.: 
[00:59:00] But it's just that I am worried about ... who is going to see about him? 
male speaker: 
Mm-hmm (affirmative). 
Christine L.: 
Okay. 
Lorna R.: 
Who will understand him? 
Christine L.: 
But why do? Why? Because, ten years from now he might know your name. 
Lorna R.: 
I have no idea why. 
Christine L.: 
Yeah. So what we say in the lingo ... in the lingo of caregiver. 
Lorna R.: 
What I keep saying is I am with- 
Christine L.: 
Why? 
Lorna R.: 
I think there is a- 
Christine L.: 
The parents not treating you right, in terms of monetary gain? 
Lorna R.: 
No.  
Christine L.: 
And so why? You [00:59:30] know, I could say this to you. 
Lorna R.: 
I think it has something to do with my spiritual connection ... 
Christine L.: 
I see. Okay.  
Lorna R.: 
Kind of thing.  
Christine L.: 
I see. Okay. Wow. Big faith. 
Lorna R.: 
Because I don't want anybody ... And you know, all that he ... I am going 
though? 
Christine L.: 
Yes. 
Lorna R.: 
With the mother not giving me the fine. 
Christine L.: 
Yeah. The wage staff. The wage staff. 
Lorna R.: 
Because I tell her about that already. 
Christine L.: 
Mm-hmm (affirmative). The poverty wages.

Lorna R.: 
I am telling her ... it's ten years, I have not gotten a- 
Christine L.: 
A raise. 
Lorna R.: 
[01:00:00] A raise increase.  
Christine L.: 
Mm-hmm (affirmative). 
Lorna R.: 
When I ask her, she tell me when she get a raise, I will get a- 
Section 6 of 15 
[00:50:00 - 01:00:04] 
Section 7 of 15 
[01:00:00 - 01:10:04] (NOTE: speaker names may be different in each section) 
Speaker 1: 
Yes.

Is increased. When I ask her, she tell me when she get a raise, I will get a raise. 
Speaker 1: 
Yeah. She's gotten many raises. She's a corporate lawyer, right? 
Speaker 2: 
I spoke to her rabbi. He made me know to know when she got a job. When her 
job-

Raise. 
Speaker 2: 
Raise up. What you call it? Give her a- 
Speaker 1: 
An increase.  
Speaker 2:

Speaker 1: 
The [01:00:30] rabbi? 
Speaker 2: 
The rabbi. She doesn't know I know that, but I will have to let her know very 
soon. 
Speaker 1: 
Wow. 
Speaker 2: 
You know ... As I tell him, I say- 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
39
Speaker 1: 
Wow. 
Speaker 2: 
I'm still ... I'm living. I'm still, as you say, pay my rent. 
Speaker 1: 
That's what I'm saying ... How are you spirituality? [01:01:00] We could bring 
Jesus as black ... As women of color who are Christianized, and you're right. I 
don't like the fact that you mentioned that for even the women before us who 
did this work and the white womans in the south ... As I like to say, they would 
say nobody knows the trouble I've seen. 
Speaker 2: 
Uh huh. 
Speaker 1: 
They give their black breasts in white babies mouth. And technically that's the 
same thing. 
Speaker 2: 
Yes, yes. It is. 
Speaker 1: 
Nothing has changed. 
Speaker 2: 
No. 
Speaker 1: 
Technically, your black colored breast is in this baby's mouth because here what 
you're saying [01:01:30] ... Your faith kind of informs your spirituality which is 
your faith which is kind of the way, but then religion does keep us back to we 
was. As back to, and as much as we love our Jesus, it holds us back. 
Speaker 2: 
Yeah. 
Speaker 1: 
Because here it is. You're ill-treated in terms of which [inaudible 01:01:48]. 
You're salary is pretty meager for all that you do. You're dealing with a special 
needs kid- 
Speaker 2: 
Yes. 
Speaker 1: 
And listen, especially teach them as you want and drive $50 an hour to deal with 
this sort of ... Or $75 [01:02:00] an hour. 
Speaker 2: 
Of course. Yeah. 
Speaker 1: 
I kind of exaggerated a little bit, but trust me. A special need teacher not 
demanding less than $20 to see more this kid. 
Speaker 2: 
Of course. 
Speaker 1: 
You and I know this. 
Speaker 2: 
$45.

She used to have one of the teachers come in. 
Speaker 1: 
Okay. 
Speaker 2: 
In the evening. 
Speaker 1: 
Okay. 
Speaker 2: 
$45 and that was 10 years ago.  
Speaker 1: 
Okay, and it's increased now. 
Speaker 2: 
Of course. 
Speaker 1: 
With all these ... With the teachers strike [01:02:30] and increase in living wage 
and all of that. 
Speaker 2: 
One of the teachers from his school used to come and say she's taking him out 
in the park and blah, blah, blah, blah. 
Speaker 1: 
As form of rehabilitation. 
Speaker 2: 
For 2 hours. 3 hours. 
Speaker 1: 
Socialization skill. 
Speaker 2: 
$45 an hour, and all I knew is the day she didn't leave a check with her- 
Speaker 1: 
For $90 if you're 2 hours, right? 
Speaker 2: 
She called me and asked me if I could give her some of the money. 
Speaker 1: 
Really? 
Speaker 2: 
I had to go to the bank and withdraw money from my- 
Speaker 1: 
Account. 
Speaker 2: 
Account. 
Speaker 1: 
To give to [01:03:00] the woman. 
Speaker 2:

Can you imagine these people, for real? 
Speaker 2: 
When we gave them she asked me and I text her. She was in somewhere ... 
Brazil or some country she was- 
Speaker 1: 
Wow. 
Speaker 2: 
So I text her and tell her, "You didn't leave any money for Ray." "Uh, I forgot." 
Speaker 1: 
Uh huh. 
Speaker 2: 
She want her money. 
Speaker 1: 
She want her money. So wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.

When she came the day, she pay me. [01:03:30] I said, "Excuse me, this has-"

This is what the women in the basement of churches who met when they 
couldn't meet to talk about their jobs. Back in the south, we look at a book 
called The Help, those women were in the basement [01:04:00] of churches 
talking about their jobs, loving on these children despite what it is still hanging 
in the air. 
Speaker 2: 
Yeah. 
Speaker 1: 
Had to walk out on those streets in Alabama when it was ... You have no dark 
lights- 
Speaker 2: 
No lights. 
Speaker 1: 
[crosstalk 01:04:13] coming faithfully, but it's the same thing though because a 
wedge is being [inaudible 01:04:14].  
Speaker 2: 
Oh, yes. 
Speaker 1: 
Clearly. You're being underpaid for all that you do for this little boy. 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027

Speaker 2: 
We're underpaid all the time. 
Speaker 1: 
Wow. 
Speaker 2: 
I mean, you know. 
Speaker 3: 
If I could just interrupt. This connection that you have with this boy- 
Speaker 1: 
Kid. 
Speaker 3: 
I mean, [01:04:30] we talked on the set at the last interview and we talked 
about boundaries. 
Speaker 1: 
Yup. 
Speaker 3: 
With your employer. She spends a lot of time really keeping up boundaries 
because she knows that the minute you get that close connection, they love 
her. This and that. They ask ... They're take advantage of that. 
Speaker 2: 
Oh, yes. 
Speaker 1: 
Yup. 
Speaker 3: 
It's tricky with that boy because it's not the same type of dialog. He doesn't have 
the same mind [crosstalk 01:05:00]. 
Speaker 2: 
That's right. 
Speaker 3: 
You might have the closest connection to him as a person. 
Speaker 2: 
To him. Yup. 
Speaker 1: 
Yes. 
Speaker 3: 
You probably [crosstalk 01:05:08]. Is that how you feel? 
Speaker 1: 
Yeah. 
Speaker 2: 
There's many things ... I mean, you know- 
Speaker 1: 
Nobody else is coming in to the life. 
Speaker 2: 
She'll ask ... There are things that he will do and she will ask me. She will want to 
find out if he, you know- 
Speaker 1: 
Did he eat?  
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
43
Speaker 2: 
She doesn't even know. 
Speaker 1: 
What did he eat? How was school today? He couldn't tell her, but you're right. 
That's a spiritual [01:05:30] thing. [crosstalk 01:05:34] You're right. It's a 
connection, though, that she and [inaudible 01:05:36] can understand. 
Speaker 2: 
Yes, it is. 
Speaker 3: 
It's very hard to get [crosstalk 01:05:41]. 
Speaker 1: 
Because I ask her many times, "Why are you not leaving?" To the detriment of 
her health. 
Speaker 2: 
Yes, it is. 
Speaker 3: 
Right, yeah. 
Speaker 1: 
What it is. It's not like you're getting more money. 
Speaker 2: 
Nope. 
Speaker 1: 
Because, you see, it's again black women. Hello, hello, hello. Again, it's black 
women and faith informed. It's a big thing. When we talk about this loving thing 
[01:06:00] ... Even your son say, "No, don't go." 
Speaker 2: 
Yeah, he tell me not to, you know ... Because, I was, in my mind- 
Speaker 1: 
[crosstalk 01:06:05] I might can leave. I won't have nothing to do. Because the 
money ... Yes, you say it's paying the rent. There's a soul. There's a karma. 
There's a peace, because I rarely know peace, because in that house you have to 
protect every step of the way with that little boy. Every step of the way with 
that little boy. You can't turn the other eye. They're not paying you for that.  
Speaker 2: 
You know that ... You know the [01:06:30] one thing with him is ... It has 
everything to do with the mother- 
Speaker 1: 
Yeah. 
Speaker 2: 
Because once you see she is not there, he is a whole different child. 
Speaker 1: 
I see. 
Speaker 2: 
He will ... When it's 8:00 he's in his bed. 
Speaker 1: 
Okay. 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
44
Speaker 2: 
When she's around he's ... He paces, he paces, he paces. So now she'll say, 
"What time are you going to bed because I try for him to go to bed." 9:00 or 
9:30 [01:07:00] because he knows I leave at 9, so he will not go and sleep- 
Speaker 1: 
While they there. 
Speaker 2: 
Yes, until I leave. 
Speaker 1: 
A connection. 
Speaker 3: 
Stability. It is what it is. 
Speaker 1: 
Yeah. 
Speaker 2: 
That's what my son ... You know my son ... My son said the same thing. He said 
he's looking to you- 
Speaker 1: 
A mother. 
Speaker 2: 
For direction. 
Speaker 1: 
A mother. 
Speaker 2: 
He's looking to you for- 
Speaker 1: 
That's why you don't leave. 
Speaker 2: 
He said when he sees me he knows- 
Speaker 1: 
Maternal. You're not leaving him. 
Speaker 2: 
Yes, yes. 
Speaker 1: 
[01:07:30] The mother's always on the move. 
Speaker 2: 
[crosstalk 01:07:38] Because, on Mother's Day, I went to my son and we were 
talking somewhat, and I was telling him about some of the things he's doing 
again. 
Speaker 1: 
Yeah. He's regressing. He know you as a mother figure. 
Speaker 2: 
He said it comes like, you know ... He knows you are there and he knows that 
when I'm there, I have certain things to do because you don't ... This is him, eh? 
Speaker 1: 
Yeah. Yeah. 
Speaker 2: 
He don't [01:08:00] take his eyes off of me. 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
45
Speaker 1: 
The mother is not there to do what you do. 
Speaker 2: 
So I say, "Why are you look at me like that?" 
Speaker 1: 
Yeah. He understands that. 
Speaker 2: 
I said, "Stop." He will sit ... Just like you're sitting there and stare at me. Just sit. I 
go there and come back, he sits. He stare at me. Go over there and come back, 
he stare at me. I say, "Max, don't you have something to do? Why do you keep 
staring at me?" He'll drop his head down. [inaudible 01:08:34] So my son is 
trying to tell me why he is doing that, but I don't know. Maybe I'm missing it 
somewhere. 
Speaker 1: 
What does your son say? 
Speaker 2: 
He's saying that he keeps looking at me because ... If I- 
Speaker 1: 
His mother? 
Speaker 2: 
No. If I ... His brain knows that he have something to do so keep looking at me ... 
It will keep reminding him that he has to do something. 
Speaker 1: 
Okay. 
Speaker 2: 
Then maybe [01:09:00] when I see it then he will remember or some story like 
that. 
Speaker 3: 
It's a very complicated mindset that ... Being an autistic child. [crosstalk 
01:09:14] 
Speaker 1: 
It is. 
Speaker 2: 
It is. I am telling the story, but it is very, very deep. 
Speaker 1: 
Deep. But the fact that you say your faith- 
Speaker 2: 
Yes. 
Speaker 1: 
Wouldn't allow you. Your religion. 
Speaker 2: 
It will not. 
Speaker 1: 
Your Christianity. 
Speaker 2: 
It's not even my religion. 
Speaker 1: 
Yeah. Okay. Religion [inaudible 01:09:25]. 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
46
Speaker 2: 
Yes. 
Speaker 1: 
Your faith. 
Speaker 2: 
It's something ... [01:09:30] It's like I'm ... It come like a mother. 
Speaker 1: 
Yeah, yeah, yeah. How can a woman stand that change ... Cease to watch the 
child today. [crosstalk 01:09:35] Be at him, but as a mother, you feel for the 
special need kid. 
Speaker 2: 
Yes. 
Speaker 1: 
You know that after- 
Speaker 2: 
And it's like the first- 
Speaker 1: 
Yeah, okay. So you kind of don't want ... You're safeguarding him, too? 
Speaker 2: 
He was telling me the other day ... you know the [inaudible 01:09:54] kill you? I 
said, "Well, he's a [inaudible 01:10:03]" 
Speaker 1: 
It's the old Caribbean lingo. [crosstalk 01:09:58] It's the old Caribbean lingo. 
Speaker 2: 
So, here, I mean, I say [inaudible 01:10:03]. 
Speaker 1: 
[01:10:00] Yeah. I hear what you're saying, but I understand that concept- 
Section 7 of 15 
[01:00:00 - 01:10:04] 
Section 8 of 15 
[01:10:00 - 01:20:04] (NOTE: speaker names may be different in each section) 
Christine: 
Yeah, I hear what you're saying.  
Loma: 
I say his brother is the last.  
Christine: 
I understand that concept, though.  
Loma: 
Yes, yes. 
Christine: 
Because it's a lot.  
Loma: 
Oh, yes.  
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
47
Christine: 
You're internalizing it, too. The may I dey go to the doctor, the doctor tell you- 
Loma: 
Yeah, he said that, yeah.  
Christine: 
The last time you get an anxiety. I understand that lingo about that last child 
killing you because you care for him, you love him, too. You care for him.  
Loma: 
The reason why he said is that I went to him with the same ears a couple 
months ago and while I'm there [01:10:30] my phone rings. When I look it was 
her calling me and he's looking at me, he's writing and he's looking at me, the 
doctor.  
Christine: 
The doctor? 
Loma: 
I took out the phone and shouted where, where are you? I say I'm at the doctor 
office.  You know, they relates, tell me something worse. She's on her bed with 
some story. I said, "Okay, when I reach, we'll [01:11:00] deal with that." When I 
hang up the phone, he just stood and he looked at me. He said, "That is your 
problem." 
Christine: 
The doctor? Clearly, clearly. He said, "Ms. Robley that is your problem." That is 
... Yeah.  
Loma: 
Wow. We haven't even reached our next questions. That's the daily run. 
[01:11:30] He said that insightfully, that is your problem and that is your 
problem. Not the child.  
Christine: 
No. Not the child, because the energy is parlayed onto the child. That's why 
when she's there he pays.  
Loma: 
That's right.  
Christine: 
When he's there, there's a little boundary. He also know that you is not his 
mother, but he know that he's getting the love that rivals any other, even the 
one that his mother's giving, that she can't give him because she's busy hustling 
for life for them, a living [01:12:00] for them. Not a life, a living.  
Loma: 
For her son.  
Christine: 
That's is fleeing for herself.  
Loma: 
Nothing for them, for herself because- 
Christine: 
So, that's my point. It's not a life.  
Loma: 
Because the father is capable.  
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
48
Christine: 
It's a living. Yeah, if you understand the sentiments in my word. She's not there 
for his every need, you are. That's why the doctor could say that's your problem.  
Loma: 
Yeah, because I do everything.  
Christine: 
In that insightful, deep profound way. That's your problem.   
Loma: 
They have parents, who when the children have to go to the doctor to do 
medical and everything, [01:12:30] they go with them, no? 
Christine: 
Yeah.  
Loma: 
I have to do it.  
Christine: 
I get your point. Any doctor's office will tell you about the sheet and ask you 
about her son. The minute I knew she called and said ‚ÄúWhat's the doctor's 
report?‚Äù 
Loma: 
It had nothing to do with ... It wasn't anything to do with them. She called me 
about to do about herself.  
Christine: 
Okay, while you were at the doctor's office? 
Loma: 
Yeah, she called me to tell me.  
Christine: 
No, just for clarification.  
Loma: 
I was at the doctor office ... She called me the morning.  
Christine: 
With her son? 
Loma: 
No.  
Christine: 
Or you? 
Loma: 
I was doing ... I went by the doctor the morning. I was ... [01:13:00] This is not 
even, this is early morning, Christine, 10:00 or 11:00.  
Speaker 3: 
You were getting yourself checked out? 
Loma: 
Yes.  
Christine: 
Okay, I thought you was with her son, yes, and she calls you? 
Loma: 
No, I was in the doctor office. I went because my ear- 
Christine: 
He said- 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
49
Loma: 
Yeah.  
Christine: 
Wow, this morning? 
Loma: 
No. The ears came back again.  
Christine: 
Oh, my Lord.  
Loma: 
It was the same ears.  
Christine: 
Yeah, and he said to you- 
Loma: 
So I realize now what's going on because I [01:13:30] went again to him this 
morning to tell me there's nothing wrong with my ear.  
Christine: 
Let me ask you a question. I like the fact that he said to you that's your problem 
and he said nothing else.  
Loma: 
Yeah, nothing else. He said, "That's your problem." 
Christine: 
Well, you awoke when he said that? 
Loma: 
I was sitting in his office.  
Christine: 
No, you don't understand me. You understand, right? Were you awoke when 
said it.  
Loma: 
Oh, yes, oh, yes.  
Christine: 
That's my point.  
Loma: 
Oh, yeah. I know it.  
Christine: 
Okay, and what the person tell you? The young one, the skinny mother, right? 
[01:14:00] The Trini lingo is that the young one that's killing mother, giving 
mother the most problems. He's the young one and true. You have a big son. 
You have a son son and he's like a son because he, he become more a baby than 
his 10-year-old brother.  
Loma: 
Oh, yes.  
Christine: 
So like the young one.  
Loma: 
Oh, yes.  
Christine: 
So you had to watch that, too. That's why is say if you was awoke when the 
doctor said what he said to you.  
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
50
Speaker 3: 
What do your kids say? What does your son say when they [01:14:30] see you 
going through this and so many ... 
Loma: 
That's another story. I don't think that story need to be with this story. No, but 
he knows, they know.  
Christine: 
No, but remember the son tell us stay.  
Speaker 3: 
I know.  
Loma: 
Yeah, so that's why now anytime, anything I call him, 2:00 in the morning I can't 
sleeping, I calling my son.  
Speaker 3: 
Right.  
Loma: 
So he just tell me take a Benadryl.  
Christine: 
Oh, the lawyer now? He's kind of complex. Take [01:15:00] a Benadryl.  
Loma: 
Because it's nothing. Benadryl going to make me sleep. You know it's another 
business. That's why I can't sleep.  
Christine: 
Yeah, but then what happens. No, but then what happens when they begin to 
take the Benadryl just to go through now. You become a drug addict, too.  
Loma: 
No, I don't do that.  
Christine: 
Okay, I hear you. Wow.  
Loma: 
I am too wise for this.  
Christine: 
I feel like question was so loaded that I don't even what to go through. I mean, 
she outlined so much with him.  
Speaker 3: 
Yeah, I [01:15:30] mean, maybe if we talk about the ... I mean are there specific 
tactics because we talk about on question four, things to do about when caring 
for a child like how do you help them fall asleep. [01:16:00] These are questions 
we're asking everybody. Are there certain things that you do with a special 
[crosstalk 01:15:56] 
Loma: 
To make them? With him, because he's medicated.  
Christine: 
Oh, he's medicated? 
Loma: 
He do medication.  
Christine: 
Oh, so you have to make sure now to give him this medication.  
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
51
Loma: 
Which he really doesn't need, but, you know.  
Christine: 
Oh, no.  
Loma: 
So that medication when he takes it, it makes him sleep. So, I don't have that 
problem with the sleeping with him, but the other one, I have to put him to bed 
because if I don't go in the bed with him and sit with him and talk or read ... 
Well, now he reads for himself, but you have to be [01:16:30] there. He will not 
sleep.  
Christine: 
I'll revisit a question. What skill, we already outlined and you give, oh, my God, I 
am so moved by just as you are, I know, what skill do you need to be a domestic 
worker? I'll ask you that question, I'll go back.  
Loma: 
What skill? 
Christine: 
Yeah, what skill? 
Loma: 
You have to be a mother. That's all.  
Christine: 
Okay.  
Loma: 
What skill does a mother have? 
Christine: 
Mother with a natural skin.  
Loma: 
Good.  
Christine: 
It didn't come with a book, right? 
Loma: 
[01:17:00] You see, on my passport when asked where you worked, what was 
his? 
Christine: 
Place of employment or something like that.  
Loma: 
I think so, yeah. No, what is your something, I just put mother. Everything I write 
mother.  
Christine: 
Okay.  
Loma: 
Your job- 
Christine: 
Description.  
Loma: 
For you job description, I write mother.  
Christine: 
Okay.  
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
52
Speaker 3: 
Just hold that thought for one second.  
Christine: 
I can't even find it.  
Speaker 3: 
Okay, there are you guys. Go [01:17:30] ahead.  
Christine: 
A mother.  
Loma: 
Yes. I am a mother. Christine, a mother, a special mother.  
Christine: 
What training is necessary to be a successful domestic worker? Are we talking 
about training in terms of your job as you outlined, as you tell the story so 
poignantly and profoundly. Clearly, I mean, what [01:18:00] training is necessary 
to be a domestic worker? 
Loma: 
I think we have ... You have to have love. You have to have patience. You have 
to have understanding because I don't think there's no amount of training to say 
where could you go to learn [01:18:30] to be a domestic worker, doing the 
things that we do.  
Christine: 
That comes naturally, you think? 
Loma: 
Yes, that comes natural to us.  
Christine: 
There's no training.  
Loma: 
No.  
Christine: 
That's okay, too.  
Loma: 
The first thing we have ... The first thing comes out in us.  
Christine: 
Yeah, don't want to stigmatize or stereotype or put in a box.  
Loma: 
[01:19:00] Is a mother's love. Is a love I should say. Is a love. You know? I don't 
think there's nowhere you can go and learn to love somebody.  
Christine: 
You see there you have or you don't right? 
Loma: 
Yes. We put out our love for these ... [01:19:30] Because you can't ... You might 
go somewhere and they will teach you how to make a bed.  
Christine: 
Okay, yeah.  
Loma: 
Because I work for ... It had one time that I say I'm not going back and work in 
nobody house to work with children because when these children show their 
love for you, some parents don't like it. I work with one family a time and the

child, I was sick and [01:20:00] I stayed for a couple of days and then when I 
went back work ... 
Section 8 of 15 
[01:10:00 - 01:20:04] 
Section 9 of 15 
[01:20:00 - 01:30:04] (NOTE: speaker names may be different in each section) 
Lorna Robley: 
I stayed home for a couple days and when I went back to work, she told me she 
said, "Lorna, Mommy said [inaudible 01:20:08] was sick." I said, "Yes," because 
you know ... She said, well Lorna, you know I love you." And the mother was 
there. Then about a week later, the child came to me and she told me. She said, 
"You know, Mummy's told me to tell you ... Nah, Mummy told me not to say 'I 
love you.'" Not to tell me ...  
Christine Lewis: 
And children will repeat. They repeat. 
Lorna Robley: 
She was five years old. 
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah. They'll repeat. You just said it before. They'll repeat. They're [01:20:30] 
articulate. Listen, a four year old I work with is amazing. Articulate. Very 
precocious. You ask them, "Yes or no?" And they'll repeat, "My mother used to 
say, 'Monkey see, monkey do.'" A lot of Caribbean folks say, "When you lock the 
door, hide the key. The monkey will see the key." These kids are articulate. 
They're really articulate. They'll repeat and they know they can read a story 
good very succinctly. 
Lorna Robley: 
You can go somewhere and learn how to ... I went by this man in a place. 
[01:21:00] I said, "You know what I'll do? Some housekeeping for the time 
being." I went and was working with this rich guy and he brought in these 
people from some one of these French places to teach us how to make ... There 
was two of us. Teach us how to make the bed. I know how to make beds. 
[01:21:30] Teach us how to make the bed, tuck in, and ...  
 
You can go and learn how to make a bed. You maybe could go and learn how to 
cook. You could learn how to ... 
Christine Lewis: 
Sew. 
Lorna Robley: 
To sew, yes. I learned how to sew. I mean, I knew how to sew before, but just ... 
You know when you want to do it as a profession, you have to learn. But you 
can never learn ... Nobody [01:22:00] can teach you how to be ... 
Christine Lewis: 
A mother. 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
54
Lorna Robley: 
A babysitter. 
Christine Lewis: 
A mother. A love. 
Lorna Robley: 
A mother with love. 
Christine Lewis: 
No Dr. [leash 01:22:10] and Spock. None of them. All the books, they're right. 
The parents come to me and say, "He said this at a certain point," and I say, 
"Yeah, well he'll grow up. He'll grow to this. He'll grow to that. He'll grow up." 
What will Dr. [leash 01:22:23] matter? Every motherhood is different. 
Lorna Robley: 
Yeah, you walk into the house and they hand you a book and I look at them and 
I put the book down. 
Christine Lewis: 
[01:22:30] Or they come to you with ... [Dr. Leash 01:22:33] says, "After 15 
months, he'll do that." Who's to say after 15 months what he will think? He will 
start up and toddle. Let him toddle around the room. Dr. [Leash 01:22:44] didn't 
say how to finger paint or push the stroller this way. He'll get up and fall down. 
Lorna Robley: 
Because the same one, when I went to the other interview, she was asking me 
about how I will talk to the children and ... I said, "Well, there [01:23:00] will 
come a time when I will have to speak loud to them because if they are doing 
something wrong or if I see them in any kind of danger, I am going to shout and 
my words will not fall ..." 
Christine Lewis: 
So far. 
Lorna Robley: 
"To the ground." 
Christine Lewis: 
It came a time when you had to. 
Lorna Robley: 
I always have to be shouting at an autistic boy child. 
Christine Lewis: 
You know something? That could be a problem. 
Lorna Robley: 
No, because as I told you, he doesn't have any form of direction. 
Christine Lewis: 
[01:23:30] Of course. 
Lorna Robley: 
Sometimes, we are walking. I live right out on the street and I'm walking with 
the other brother who's ... We are in conversation and he is just walking. He will 
not know to stop before the car is coming. 
Christine Lewis: 
Let me ask you a question. Do you have to hold his hand still?

Yeah, but what I ... He likes to know. He has this thing where he wants me to 
walk in front of me, ahead of me, so I have to keep telling him, "Hello. I need 
you to walk either next to me or in back of me." 
Christine Lewis: 
He understands [01:24:00] that? 
Lorna Robley: 
Yes. 
Christine Lewis: 
Okay. 
Lorna Robley: 
He understands, but he doesn't follow orders. He doesn't do it. 
Christine Lewis: 
I see. 
Lorna Robley: 
That's why I always have to be shouting out. I always have to be saying, "Stop! 
Max, stop!" Because unless you say it loud enough for him to hear, like a ... 
Christine Lewis: 
A jolt. 
Lorna Robley: 
Yes. 
Christine Lewis: 
Okay, he gets that. 
Lorna Robley: 
Yes. 
Christine Lewis: 
Wow, and that could take a toll on you, [01:24:30] right? 
Lorna Robley: 
And then he will stop. 
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah, because the shouting reverberates back to your ear, too. You [inaudible 
01:24:37]. Everything's connected, the whole orifice. That's why you say he ... 
That's the problem. 
Lorna Robley: 
You always have to be ... 
Christine Lewis: 
Is there some specialty or expertise that you have? And you do. Is there some 
specialty or expertise that you have? And you have many. 
Lorna Robley:

Christine Lewis: 
Craft-wise, right? 
Lorna Robley: 
Yes. I'm very crafty, and not because ... Because [01:25:30] I learned from my 
mom. She taught us how to do a lot of things and I teach my children. I can do a 
lot of ... The woman I work with, every time ... Her mother always tells me I 
should have been a ... Some way to dress people, what do you call them? 
Christine Lewis: 
A stylist. 
Lorna Robley: 
Yes. If [01:26:00] I go anywhere ... One thing with the family ... It could be that, 
maybe another thing. The family, they have high regards for me.  
Christine Lewis: 
They appreciate.  
Lorna Robley: 
Yes, so if I go to anything with them or anything in the house and anybody 
comes, they will introduce me and the mother will always introduce me as a 
dressmaker and a stylist.  
Christine Lewis: 
Really? 
Lorna Robley: 
She says, "If you want anybody to go and shop with you if you want, call 
[01:26:30] Lorna." 
Christine Lewis: 
Wow. They're paying a stylist money, right? 
Lorna Robley: 
Yesterday, she's going out on a date and I have to dress her. 
Christine Lewis: 
The mother? 
Lorna Robley: 
Yes. 
Christine Lewis: 
Really? 
Lorna Robley: 
Uh huh! Which shoes? She put one on this foot, one that foot. Which one looks 
better? Which dress? No, no, no, wait! And she runs and changes three or five 
outfits. Which one looks good? Which earring? Which necklace? How is my 
[01:27:00] makeup? All of that I have to do, as I told her I did because of my 
children. 
Christine Lewis: 
And you like nice things too. You put yourself together nicely. 
Lorna Robley: 
Yes, I'm the best babysitter on the block. She knows that from all her other 
friends. 
Christine Lewis: 
That's fabulous. I believe that.

Lorna Robley: 
[crosstalk 01:27:25] she come and says, "Oh, everybody's saying I have the best 
dressed babysitter." [01:27:30] I said, [That's fine 01:27:32]. I said thank you 
very much. 
Christine Lewis: 
But you're not paid for that, right? Best dressed, being able to cook the curry 
chicken and taking care of your son, walking foot and foot ... 
Lorna Robley: 
I cook all the time. We go to the house in the Hamptons, I cook. Having a 
barbecue or a ... Everything, I cook. 
Christine Lewis: 
So how do you get them to eat? They‚Äôre natural eaters? The kids. How do you 
get them to eat? They love what you do? 
Lorna Robley: 
Yes. 
Christine Lewis: 
So it's [01:28:00] not a problem for them to eat? 
Lorna Robley: 
No. Oh, no. The smaller one, he loves meat. 
Christine Lewis: 
He loves meat. 
Lorna Robley: 
So I do barbecues for him, barbecue chicken, barbecue ribs. He loves fish so I do 
my fish. Yeah, I cook. I cook.  
Christine Lewis: 
So when they get fussy, how do you deal with that, especially with the autistic 
one when he starts to get in a little ... 
Lorna Robley: 
[01:28:30] With him, when he gets fussy, that is a challenge, but ... 
Christine Lewis: 
How so? 
Lorna Robley: 
Because you have ... There's something in my voice that he knows when I say to 
stop, to stop. He ... [01:29:00] The smaller one, all I have to do is shout at him. 
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah, the smaller one? 
Lorna Robley: 
Yeah. All I have to do is shout at him and then when I shout at him, then I have 
to apologize because he looks at me, but he gets the message. Then both of us 
are apologizing. He apologizes to me for whatever it is that he was doing that 
made me had to shout at him and then I shout at him for having to shout at him 
because [01:29:30] you know what you were doing was wrong and you know 
that I don't like to shout at you. So I apologize for that, but then he apologizes to 
me to and he says it won't happen again or whatever. With the autistic one 
now, you have to ... I usually just have to go to him.

And having the rigor that ... When you could be doing anything else. You could

it coming back to me, I give him a choice.

and have to come to a house now, and keep a house in order now. When, as I 
say, you could retire. You could go back to ...

wouldn't pay me. I said 'It's quite okay, miss.'

She wouldn't pay you?

Speaker 1: 
Okay. 
Speaker 2: 
I said ...

[01:35:30] why she pay you ...

Listen to me, I said ...

'I have a bank account in Trinidad, you know.' 
Speaker 1: 
Oh, see, you're telling her a lot. Too much, too!

No, no, no, no, no. 
Speaker 1: 
Because that's why she don't want to pay you, too! 
Speaker 2: 
No, no! 
Speaker 1: 
Because if you're telling her you have a bank account ... Let's get real, now.  
Speaker 2: 
Yes. 
Speaker 1: 
You're telling this woman you have a bank account ...  
Speaker 2:

Okay.

I am not letting ... As I told her one time ... 
Speaker 1: 
Okay.

I said 'I didn't come to this country because of poverty.'

Domestic Workers United

Speaker 2: 
'I was not [01:36:00] born in poverty.' 
Speaker 1: 
And that's what the woman ... That's what Camilla wrote in her book. 
"Caribbean woman came here educated!" 
Speaker 2: 
'I wasn't born in poverty.' 
Speaker 1: 
Okay. 
Speaker 2: 
'I didn't grow in poverty.' 
Speaker 1: 
Okay. 
Speaker 2: 
'And I didn't leave my country because of poverty to come here.' 
Speaker 1: 
Right. We all ... Different reasons.  
Speaker 2: 
I said 'I come here because my son wanted to ...' 
Speaker 1: 
Go to school. 
Speaker 2: 
'Go to school and educate himself.' 
Speaker 1: 
I came here to get involved in the arts. That's why [crosstalk 01:36:22] 
Speaker 2: 
I said 'They coming here since they was 7 years old.' 
Speaker 1: 
Yeah.

'So they know about America.'

Of course. So that is a privilege right there.

Into a job, where, okay, whether your paper is here or not, or you're 
undocumented ... Even, no matter what ... 
Speaker 2: 
That is none of their business.  
Speaker 1: 
Right. 
Speaker 2: 
If you're not documented. 
Speaker 1: 
But it's not a badge. It's not [01:37:00] a rod to treat you the way they treat you. 
Speaker 2: 
That's right! That's right! 
Speaker 1: 
Because, as you just say, you're giving care to kit and cane on plantations that 
history says, in my writing ... Here it is, right? You have ... You're giving ... I 
mean, I believe ... I haven't even begin to fathom the level of care given to this 
autistic child. Not being qualified and taking less wage and still saying here that 
you're faith, I'm just paraphrasing, about your faith and forms. But why you 
don't leave?

Speaker 1: 
Scottsdale is money, too. 
Speaker 2: 
And she found a reason every Thursday so that I will not get a leave. 
Speaker 1: 
Of course the Negroes cannot read and write. It's still prominent. It still 
permeates. You [01:38:30] understand? From that 1913 New Deal. 
Speaker 2: 
Imagine this thing! 
Speaker 1: 
Yeah! Because they feel that. They feel you're not entitled to ... Because your 
time is their time. You're putting out them thing in their time ... In their leisure 
time. 
Speaker 2: 
And there and then, you know, I should have left. Because that ... I had now 
started to work ... Come here, and started to work in this country. 
Speaker 1: 
I am curious, though. With you having to put this kid on the bus, do you have to 
put the 10 year old on the bus ... What happens with you and that 10 year old?

No, he ... He walks to school.

[01:39:00] You walk to school with him? 
Speaker 2: 
Mm-hmm (affirmative). 
Speaker 1: 
So, wait. So how ... 
Speaker 2: 
And I pick him up every evening.  
Speaker 1: 
So you walk with the autistic kid to school, with him? Or the autistic kid is gone 
by that time?

No, he's gone by that time. 
Speaker 1:

take a 5 minutes breather, literally, and then head out the door. 
Speaker 2: 
Listen, there's only now ... There's only now ... This year, as he turned 17, that I 
have not carried him with me. When I'm ... If he's at home ...

leave him in the house.

Okay.

But now that he turned 17 ...

I'm taking a chance and doing it.

And you're taking a chance!

Yes. I'm taking a chance.

But you say he opens the door.

No, I lock my ... I lock the door.

Lorna Robley: 
Yes, once he's not ... I'm doing it.  
Christine Lewis: 
Why you would rather not carry him though? 
Lorna Robley: 
Hmm? 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027

Christine Lewis: 
Why you would rather not carry him with a boy? 
Lorna Robley: 
Because he just, his whole behavior. He has a behavior pattern with them. 
[01:41:00] Sometimes it's a little too much. Then you have him in the household 
going on doing that. I just need that 10 minute break too.  
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah, for you.  
Lorna Robley: 
Yes. Just to break the monotony of the ... 
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah.  
Lorna Robley: 
Sometime I just say, "Okay let me just run ... " So now I'll tell him, "I'm going for 
Alex, you are not coming with me. Go on the computer, I'll be right back".  
Christine Lewis: 
Okay, he understands that and he goes on the computer? 
Lorna Robley: 
Sometimes he say yes and sometimes he tells me no [01:41:30] computer. He 
wants to go on the chair and watch the dog.  
Christine Lewis: 
I'm curious, he knows to get on ... he navigates the computer? 
Lorna Robley: 
Yeah.  
Christine Lewis: 
Interesting, really. What he does on the computer when he goes on the 
computer? 
Lorna Robley: 
Only Sesame Street, and YouTube or lesbian joke. He sits in the day the mother 
on the sofa doing whatever, he on the other sofa, I in the kitchen trying to do 
some [01:42:00] preparation for dinner. The next thing we hear him say is 
Lesbian Jokes. 
Christine Lewis: 
What? 
Lorna Robley: 
I look up, say, look at the mother, what's that Max? 
 
"Lesbian Jokes" 
 
And he laughs with a big grin.  
 
And his mother lying on her stomach and she looks back at me. 
Christine Lewis: 
[01:42:30] (Laughing) Lesbian Jokes.  
Lorna Robley: 
So hear me, "Max, where you hear that from"? 
 
"Youtube"

(Laughing) 
Christine Lewis: 
(Laughing) 
Lorna Robley: 
Lesbian jokes on YouTube. 
Christine Lewis: 
On YouTube. 
Lorna Robley: 
What's he doing on YouTube? 
Christine Lewis: 
No but ... 
Lorna Robley: 
Okay.  
Christine Lewis: 
I'm telling ...  
Lorna Robley: 
Amazing.  
Christine Lewis: 
Listen, the mind is a terrible thing to waste. 
Lorna Robley: 
Christine, Amazing. 
Christine Lewis: 
Amazing, you hear what I'm telling you? [01:43:00] (laughing) I'm baffled. 
Amazing. That's why I say the mind is a terrible thing to waste. 
Lorna Robley: 
Yes.  
Christine Lewis: 
You wonder, it's funny.  
Lorna Robley: 
And everybody say, you cracking up. It's funny and he's laughing, its funny. 
Christine Lewis: 
So it's funny you say this because ... 
Lorna Robley: 
I was like this is unbelievable.  
Christine Lewis: 
One day I call my aunt, my aunt has Alzheimer, and I call my aunt. I said to my 
mother, "Let me talk to auntie Dixie". Auntie Dixie [01:43:30] sang for me from 
beginning to end ‚ÄúI Know My Redeemer Lives.‚Äù You know that is not an easy 
hymn.  
Lorna Robley: 
No.  
Christine Lewis: 
In her Alzheimer mind. 
Lorna Robley: 
Okay.  
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
72
Christine Lewis: 
Okay. And when she was done singing it she went back to asking me, "A long 
time I didn't see you all, how's the weather over there"? In her Alzheimer mind. 
So that comes to mind, he's looking at YouTube with one autistic mindset and 
when asked you surfing YouTube lesbian jokes? 
Lorna Robley: 
Lesbian Jokes.  
Christine Lewis: 
Oh, Lord.  
Lorna Robley: 
I keep looking, haven't wanted to go [01:44:00] and check this thing out. Up to 
now I just never remember. I just need to go on YouTube, lesbian jokes. 
Christine Lewis: 
Interesting. Lesbian jokes, what did mother say? 
Lorna Robley: 
She just look at me and I just look at her. 
Christine Lewis: 
A little grin or no? 
Lorna Robley: 
Yes.  
Christine Lewis: 
You say, [inaudible 01:44:14] 
Lorna Robley: 
I'm like, what? And she goes ... 
Christine Lewis: 
(Laughing) Oh, God no. So this is too much. My Lord. Have you ever used ... you 
know [01:44:30] we were talking about things we use for the kids that pacifies 
them that the doctor's medicine don't. Think, we come in from the Caribbean 
and we know all these little mix and that. So have you ever used any 
homeopathic remedies or folk remedies to help cure a child who is sick? Like if 
they have something and you feel that western medicine ... Have you ever tried 
anything? 
 
Both of them, between both of them, are there things that you go to? 
Lorna Robley: 
Not really. The only thing that I use on them is the Vicks.  
Christine Lewis: 
Oh, [01:45:00] the Vicks.  
Lorna Robley: 
This is Richard's cupboard. 
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah, universal, Vicks is universal.  
Lorna Robley: 
The mother, she have a constipation problem so I give her Cera and salts.  
Christine Lewis: 
Oh, parents don't like that you know. They don't like ... I used to bring the kids 
alkalol when I having my sinus problem and I would have that sore throat. It 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027

solves the sore throat. I stopped sucking herbs and all of them zubes lozenges, I 
stopped sucking [01:45:30] those things.  
Lorna Robley: 
I agree.  
Christine Lewis: 
Anytime my sinus are starting and I'm getting the post-nasal drip I drink alkalol. 
You don't find it by the Rite-Aid you find it in the little Indian pharmaceutical 
centers. You know them little fly by night ... Not fly by ... They've been around 
years. I would drink alkalol and it would solve the mucus. I would bring it to the 
kids. alkalol. 
Lorna Robley: 
Well I need some of that right now.  
Christine Lewis: 
It's in a bottle and you gargle with a little portion of warm water, they say put 
salt. Anytime I feel my throat getting sore through the sinuses [01:46:00] I 
gargle it with a bit of warm water.  
 
I would bring to the kids I used to work for, I would buy them a bottle and I 
realized they don't want the taste of that and I took back the bottle and I 
brought it home and I was glad that I did. I'm saying that to say, Americans they 
don't like nothing bitter. It's funny that the mother drinks the Cera and salts, 
and it works? 
Lorna Robley: 
Mm-hmm (affirmative)  
Christine Lewis: 
It works, for the mother? 
Lorna Robley: 
She try it as a tea. I brought up some and I went to the pots.  
Christine Lewis: 
You don't give her the ballerina tea? The ballerina tea will do it too.  
Lorna Robley: 
Nothing works for that lady, trust me. 
Christine Lewis: 
It don't [01:46:30] work? 
Lorna Robley: 
That works but she has to drink the tea ... I give her the salts one time. She tell 
that didn't work. I said okay. So I brought some Cera pods I had home, I dried it 
for her. I put some ginger in it. I say do not drink it now, wait.  
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah, let it marinate.  
Lorna Robley: 
Yes. So apparently she drank it about 10 o'clock. [01:47:00] Then she text me in 
the morning. "Oh, it didn't work, it did nothing. I tell you nothing doesn't 
works".  
Christine Lewis: 
Okay, mine said too.  
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
74
Lorna Robley: 
Then when it hit her she tell me, she text back, "Oh my God this thing really 
work". She said one time she had a ... what you call it, phone thing, phone what 
you call it ... 
Christine Lewis: 
An app? 
Lorna Robley: 
No she had a conference [01:47:30] call. 
Christine Lewis: 
Oh my God, that would have been problems. (laughing) Not with cera and salts. 
Lorna Robley: 
Of course then it matters not.  
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah, yeah, that would have been problems.  
Lorna Robley: 
She said, "Oh my God, it's a good thing I had a conference call this morning". 
Christine Lewis: 
At home.  
Lorna Robley: 
Yeah. 
Christine Lewis: 
Mm-hmm (affirmative)  
Lorna Robley: 
Like when it hits you so.  
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah, like ra-ra-ra-ra-ra with cera and salts.  
Lorna Robley: 
But whenever I give them a home remedy they use it.  
Christine Lewis: 
Mm-hmm (affirmative) I was telling somebody, I think I was saying in one of the 
interviews where [01:48:00] this babysitter say ... Kids get eczema. 
Lorna Robley: 
Yes.  
Christine Lewis: 
And she couldn't stand to see nothing the doctor give the child would work. She 
say, "Christine, when them people wasn't there I put the child in some warm 
water with Epsom salt and baking soda". She said, "It's okay that I relieved the 
child's itch". 
Lorna Robley: 
No I ... 
Christine Lewis: 
That's what it is. We insert here, because sometimes ... It come like the baby I'm 
working for. The mother doesn't feed the baby, sometimes I go and I want to 
bring a can of formula to feed the baby, because we know the baby ... at nine 
months the baby [01:48:30] should be drinking about six ounces a feed, that's 
all? 
Lorna Robley: 
One thing I have to say with her, she doesn't mind. I give him, Alex, sago. 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
75
Christine Lewis: 
Sago porridge. It's a little ...  
Lorna Robley: 
It's like ... 
Christine Lewis: 
It looks like little noodles, little couscous.  
Lorna Robley: 
Yeah like couscous.  
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah, and it's a porridge.  
Lorna Robley: 
It's good for [01:49:00] infants. Well we know it will nurture and ... You mix it 
with formula and it give them like a body and I give Alex that and she didn't 
mind.  
Christine Lewis: 
Like something I think my employer would say ... 
Lorna Robley: 
I started to work with him when he was three months, two months going on 
three.  
Christine Lewis: 
That baby delivered there.  
Lorna Robley: 
Yeah. All this jazz of the food. I take that and I ... 
Christine Lewis: 
Throw it out.  
Lorna Robley: 
Yeah. I put it in the cupboard.  
Christine Lewis: 
[01:49:30] You don't give them kids stuff at all. 
Lorna Robley: 
I used to go and buy the yam ... 
Christine Lewis: 
The sweet yam. 
Lorna Robley: 
The sweet yam and the sweet potato and the white sweet potato ... 
Christine Lewis: 
And crush it, and feed him.  
Lorna Robley: 
And he would eat it.  
Christine Lewis: 
And how old? 
Lorna Robley: 
Three months, from three months when I started to work with him. I 
immediately hand me the pacifier and I throw that away. I tell her I say, I don't 
work with this.  
Male : 
No pacifier?

Lorna Robley: 
No pacifier.

Lorna Robley: 
Yeah.  
Christine Lewis: 
Caribbean children don't ...  
Lorna Robley:

and throw it away.

Lorna Robley: 
You know how much time I see babysitters and I want to take it out and throw it 
away? 
Christine Lewis: 
I do it, no, I give the kid a pacifier but that's not something that we practice. 
Male: 
Okay.  
Christine Lewis: 
Kids cry and they get over. We tell them Hmm-mm (no), stop it now, little boy, 
when I saw Hmm-mm (no) you're getting into trouble. John-John, no-no, no-no, 
Hmm-mm (no). Listen to Christine, he stops, 9 months. We didn't give our kids 
pacifiers. 
Male: 
At night my son doesn't like them, he never liked it. 
Lorna Robley: 
Liked it? Very good. 
Christine Lewis: 
And he goes to sleep without fussing? 
Male: 
Yeah, I mean he fusses, but the pacifier just never [01:50:30] caught.  
Christine Lewis: 
Do it.  
Male: 
We tried it and then we just gave up. 
Lorna Robley: 
I always, with the children I work with from babies, I always have free reign with 
them. I worked with one family before this one, super rich, everywhere we go

we fly private jet and that kind of thing. Two kids, they had 2 babysitters, but 
[01:51:00] when we had to travel, which they used to do often, it was only me 
because the rest of them couldn't travel. I was the travelling babysitter. 
Christine Lewis: 
I see. 
Lorna Robley: 
The little boy named Alexander, oh, he didn't used to sleep. 10 o'clock, 11 
o'clock in the night, I went in to put him down, you had to be like a cat sneaking 
out of the room. Then 3 o'clock in the morning he up again, cry cry cry.  
Christine Lewis: 
It's penance.  
Lorna Robley: 
[01:51:30] I used to just pick him up and just ... Another time, we were in, 
what's one of them Caribbean islands?  [inaudible 01:51:38] The house was right 
near the beach. I got up every morning like 4 o'clock. As soon as I sit down, sun 
up, go outside in the porch, as soon as I see the sun coming up on the thing, I 
walk straight out in the ocean and beat him, in the ocean. I tired, I said, no, 
[01:52:00] he's got to sleep. Might I beat his skin on that water, that salt water.  
Christine Lewis: 
By that time it's drooping.  
Lorna Robley: 
I come back and in then, [inaudible 01:52:10] knock him out.  
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah, he's out like a light.  
Lorna Robley: 
I said, you will sleep now. I went back in the house, change the clothes, I said I 
walked straight out in the ocean.  
Christine Lewis: 
She said water [inaudible 01:52:20] I know right, you funny.  
 
So is there any special skill you might have taught your employer? Is there 
anything that you bring? 
Lorna Robley: 
[01:52:30] The cooking, because we share ... I teach them something ... 
Christine Lewis: 
She cooks Caribbean? 
Lorna Robley: 
Of my skill, my cooking. I do the ... our seasoning.  
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah, you do that for them? 
Lorna Robley: 
They want it, I have [01:53:00] to grind up all my seasoning. 
Christine Lewis: 
All the seasoning, the cilantro, the parsley, the chives, the onions ... 
Lorna Robley: 
Everything.  
Domestic Workers United

Christine Lewis: 
Oh she wants that? 
Lorna Robley: 
Yes, I do it for the family. Not only her but her mother.  
Christine Lewis: 
So you put it in the bottles, so they marinate chicken like a Trinidadian then? 
Get out of here.  
Lorna Robley: 
The mother, like especially ... I don't do it all the time, but during the summer 
the thing they tell us is like for barbecuing. I have to make that and give it to 
them. [01:53:30] Then my hot sauce.  
Christine Lewis: 
Okay. You give them pepper sauce? 
Lorna Robley: 
Hello, yeah.  
Christine Lewis: 
(Laughing) and you mince Jalapeno? 
Lorna Robley: 
Yes.  
Christine Lewis: 
Darn. Darn. All of that, Lord, Father, you good. 
Lorna Robley: 
My hot sauce.  
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah, why do they want pepper sauce? They want that pepper sauce? 
Lorna Robley: 
Yes.  
Christine Lewis: 
And you're doing Kongo pepper? 
Lorna Robley: 
My barbecue, I have to [01:54:00] make barbecue sauce. 
Christine Lewis: 
No wonder she feel she got to pay you Lorna, why buy the cow when you can 
get the milk for free? 
Lorna Robley: 
Yep.  
Christine Lewis: 
That ain't right.  
Lorna Robley: 
That's what they just tell me.  
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah, you do. I don't understand it though.  
Lorna Robley: 
They say, "You spoil us". So what do you expect.  
Christine Lewis: 
You tidy?  
Lorna Robley: 
Mm-hmm (affirmative)  
Domestic Workers United

Christine Lewis: 
And it be because of the little boy.  
 
So tell me now, what is the best part of your job? With all that you outline, and 
oh my God I feel for you, what is the best part of your job? 
Lorna Robley: 
[01:54:30] The best part of my job is ... what's the best part of my job, Lord? 
She's a working mother, should I say mother or woman? 
Christine Lewis: 
Woman. Yeah, mother, woman. 
Lorna Robley: 
The autistic boy she has to deal with in her mind. [01:55:00] Because with him, 
is death do us part. He is a child ... she can't say, "Well I have two sons " ... 
Christine Lewis: 
He's a baby for life.  
Lorna Robley: 
And in the next five years that one is going to be off my hands. He's going to be 
married or get grandchildren from him, no. 
Christine Lewis: 
The reality is ... 
Lorna Robley: 
I kind of feel for her in that way.  
Christine Lewis: 
And that's what keeps you [01:55:30] to that job.  
Lorna Robley: 
The best part of my job, I would say, is just working with the two boys, 
especially when the mother not home, not there.  
Christine Lewis: 
The energy.  
Lorna Robley: 
When she's not there it's a different type of energy. I just ...  
Christine Lewis: 
So you can say when she's not there that's the best part of your job. It's easy 
going and you can maneuver and do what you want to do.  
Lorna Robley: 
Yes, when [01:56:00] the mother is not at home that's the best part of the job.  
Christine Lewis: 
It's a difference, yeah. 
 
What is the worst part of your job? 
Lorna Robley: 
The worst part of my job is, not really understanding, the autism, the autistic ... 
[01:56:30] The meaning of the word autistic. Having to deal with the autistic 
child that I work with, that's the hardest part of my job because I don't really 
understand ...  
Christine Lewis: 
The sickness, the disease. 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
80
Lorna Robley: 
Yes. I never really study it or have somebody, an expert, sit down and talk about 
it. Still in the house she ... although you know, I [01:57:00] know that you 
shouldn't really treat him as an autistic child per say, but she's supposed to let 
me know that, hey, this is what's going on. She still hides some of his ... 
especially his medical ... even in the school. I know there are certain times when 
they call her to let her know that his behavior is not appropriate [01:57:30] or 
acceptable and she will not saying anything to me.  
Christine Lewis: 
She's not being upfront.  
Lorna Robley: 
That's the worst part, not knowing sometimes the things that he does and she's 
not communicating, communication.  
Christine Lewis: 
I see, that‚Äôs why I ask you. I'm curious that you're working a job as a caregiver 
and it segues into a special need class. [01:58:00] You're not getting paid for it 
and you're still not clear about what it is. It is a disease, it's something kids are 
born with.  
Lorna Robley: 
They even asked me. They had a time, the phone, I saw the school, the name of 
the school came up and I answered the phone and they were asking me if 
anything changed during the week because he was agitated and he was 
misbehaving.  
Christine Lewis: 
Let me ask you a question, have you ever asked the [01:58:30] school ... Have 
you ever gone to the school and say to the school, "I don't understand. I'm 
working with this kid, is there a class or something"? 
Lorna Robley: 
I went the first time he started with the school. I think all of that was part of 
that ACS story and in conversation with one of the teachers I was telling her that 
... About ... I keep telling myself because ... He had just gone to this school, they 
didn't have any bus service for him at the time. It's all [01:59:00] the way in 
Delanty Street. I have to go and get him, I have to carry him. Which sometimes 
she would drop him in mornings which was difficult for her. 
Christine Lewis: 
Of course. So stop me, if it's difficult for her, it's also difficult for you? 
Lorna Robley: 
It's more difficult for me.  
Christine Lewis: 
Hello.  
Lorna Robley: 
Okay.  
Christine Lewis: 
I bet.  
Lorna Robley: 
Remember it's two children I'm dealing with.  
Christine Lewis: 
Hello.

Lorna Robley: 
I have to pick him up. I [01:59:30] have to go and get him from school. So on my 
way, I have to stop off at West Broad [Broadway?] street, take ... 
Christine Lewis: 
My Lord. 
Lorna Robley: 
The M or the F train back to Delancey street, walk eight blocks ... 
Christine Lewis: 
With this kid, who by this time getting agitated.  
Lorna Robley: 
Well he's in the school. I don't take him until I get [02:00:00] there and then 
they bring him out of the class. I have to walk all of that way to get ... 
Section 12 of 15 
[01:50:00 - 02:00:04] 
Section 13 of 15 
[02:00:00 - 02:10:04] (NOTE: speaker names may be different in each section) 
Christine Lewis: 
And then they would bring him off of the [class 02:00:01]. 
Lorna Robley: 
Okay. 
Christine Lewis: 
I have to walk all of that way to get him out of school. Then I have to walk all the 
way back to Delancey Street, get on a train to 42nd, Grand [Pac 02:00:15] then 
get the 7 ... 
Lorna Robley: 
To Queens? 
Christine Lewis: 
To the job. 
Lorna Robley: 
Yeah. 
Christine Lewis: 
Then to go and get Alex. 
Lorna Robley: 
My lord. 
Christine Lewis: 
The trains sometime have problems. 
Lorna Robley: 
Yup, yup, yup, for real. 
Christine Lewis: 
So now I have to [02:00:30] see if I can call somebody to ask them if the ... Or 
see if I can call or text and tell them, "The train's having problem, I'm running 
late", to see if she can get somebody to get Alex off of school. 
Lorna Robley: 
To pick up- 
Domestic Workers United

Christine Lewis: 
[Foreign Language 02:00:44]. 
Lorna Robley: 
Yes, thank you very much.  
Christine Lewis: 
Wow, and you're still in [B&P 02:00:50]. 
Lorna Robley: 
Yes. That went on for ... About four months before they got the bus [02:01:00] 
to started come to pick him up. 
Christine Lewis: 
I am curious too, I am curious. When you started to bring him to school, and she 
would do it, was there a difference, did he have any reaction because now is the 
babysitter bringing him, as opposed to his mother, you know when you started 
it was ... 
Lorna Robley: 
He don't care for the mother, yeah, when I coming to meet him- 
Christine Lewis: 
But when you don't start with them when they're young and they know the 
difference, they know the difference, this is mom and this is Lorna. 
Lorna Robley: 
They bring him and I just start to work with him. 
Christine Lewis: 
[02:01:30] How old he was again, remind me? 
Lorna Robley: 
Six years. No, he had his school bus, the bus used to pick him up. He used to go 
to school right there on 42nd, 47th, is a special school, close to the ... 
Christine Lewis: 
UN? 
Lorna Robley: 
To the UN, yes, Iran school. Used to go there. 
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah. 
Lorna Robley: 
So, the bus used to pick him up and then, you know ... Then bring him back by 
the evenings. Sometimes I used to have to go and get him. 
Christine Lewis: 
In the city? 
Lorna Robley: 
Yeah. I had a special pass. 
Christine Lewis: 
[02:02:00] Okay. 
Lorna Robley:

Lorna Robley: 
Like any kind of emergency, right at United Nations, and they block off the 
whole area, I had a pass so that I had to show them, to get in, to go and get him 
from the school.  
Christine Lewis: 
I see.  
Lorna Robley: 
All of that was my responsibility. 
Christine Lewis: 
He never fussed with the transition? 
Lorna Robley: 
No.

Never fussed.

We're not on question 12, but I don't know if you ... I feel like you've answer 
[02:02:30] that. 
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah, I think, yeah- 
Male: 
The question is: "How is the relationship with your current employer?" 
Christine Lewis: 
I think we could have, did she- 
Male: 
It's up to you. 
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah, I don't think she answered ... In little slivers, it came out, but will directly 
ask her again. What is your relationship with your employer, it came out but I 
want ... 
Lorna Robley: 
We have a good working relationship. 
Christine Lewis: 
Okay. 
Lorna Robley: 
Because I ... [02:03:00] I like to talk and put things on the table. The only thing is 
the finances that she does not want to discuss. I brought it up again not too long 
ago. 
Christine Lewis: 
I'll tell you something with finances, relationship and finances don't gel. When 
it's husband and wife, most times, men and women get divorced because of 
finances, [inaudible 02:03:28], relationship [02:03:30] don't sustain because of 
finances, work relationships, work relationships. I'm just curious, with all that 
was said today in this interview, in this storytelling here, that you still stay, but 
yet you would trade off a good relationship, you know what I'm saying, because 
you have a laxity on the job, and it happened with me. When I had just come 
here, I used to work for [Trader 02:03:50] $50 from 8:30 to 10:30 at night. 
Domestic Workers United

Lorna Robley: 
Yeah, me too. 
Christine Lewis: 
But here, I had the whim of the house to myself. I could've raised the boy 
[02:04:00] however I wanted. She wasn't over me with an iron rod and saying, 
"Do this or do it my way." The one here today, would say, "Doctor say do it this 
way" or "No, let's try it this way." I'm tired of that nonsense. If the first one, she 
leave me up to my own device. Do whatever I want with him.  
 
So, the $350 was enough, it was a [salve 02:04:23], I wouldn't trade it in, though 
it was little, but yet she gave [02:04:30] every end of the year, she'd give a 
bonus. I always look at that, that's what I know from the beginning when I came 
to this country, as small as the money was, as pitiful as it was, I still get a bonus. 
But as pitiful as it was, I run that ship better as if it was in my house. So 
sometimes the tradeoff is-so I hear you say, within the relationship, you have a 
good relationship despite the finances. 
Lorna Robley: 
Yes. 
Christine Lewis: 
So I guess that's what it is. Because you might leave the job, the thing about 
these jobs, they're so uncertain [02:05:00] and shaky, how I leave these jobs of 
running these people's home without them breathing- [crosstalk 02:05:05] 
Lorna Robley: 
But I mean, after- 
Christine Lewis: 
Hold your thought. Without them breathing down my throat. Same thing with 
the one who's 21 and 17, getting ready to turn 17, their parents allowed me, 
free rein, I had that whole-stay over, could bring a party of people, eat, cook 
food, nobody ask. Now, you move onto another job, the people say I don't want 
this one in my house, I don't want that, don't cook this food, don't bring your 
food here. I'm happy, it's interesting that you say, you have a good relationship 
[02:05:30] but except the finances, so elaborate. 
Lorna Robley: 
All my jobs is the same thing. From Scarsdale, you can bring anybody, we cook. 
Christine Lewis: 
The way you want. 
Lorna Robley: 
Yeah. At the end, the babysitters always ... 
Christine Lewis: 
Come to your space. 
Lorna Robley: 
Yes. We cook, everything. Same thing with the finance. I went to 64th and 
Madison, same thing. 
Christine Lewis: 
And that's what makes the jobs- 
Lorna Robley: 
You go to the Hamptons. 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
85
Christine Lewis: 
[02:06:00] Same thing. 
Lorna Robley: 
Yeah, cook. Free rein, but they were the fine, I got paid there. 
Christine Lewis: 
But technology the balance and budget back on your back, right? In terms of 
finance. 
Lorna Robley: 
64th and Madison was the best. No, I got paid. I work, I get paid. I travel, I get 
traveling allowance. Although, I used to drive, I used my car to go to the 
Hamptons, [02:06:30] they pay me, he give me money, he make me fill up, he 
pay me, you know. They had a credit card inside one of those stores up there, 
you can have one by, take anything you want. You buy anything you want, to 
cook, to eat, whatever.  
Christine Lewis: 
But the finance. 
Lorna Robley: 
They pay for it. That's the best one, and everything was good. But I left because 
... [02:07:00] They wanted, I think she and the husband looked like they was 
going to eventually divorced. It was the beginning of the divorce thing and she 
wanted a live-in, I did not, I did just about of that live-in, [story 02:07:16]. 
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah, you didn't want another live-in. 
Lorna Robley: 
I didn't want to live-in again, so I left. That's how I came to this one. 
Christine Lewis: 
Okay, wow. 
Lorna Robley: 
This one, the lawyer story, the [02:07:30] money thing with them, the two of 
them get into cahoot, so the money that I had asked for, they refuse to give it to 
me. 
Christine Lewis: 
This one? 
Lorna Robley: 
This person I'm working at. 
Christine Lewis: 
They refuse to give it to you. 
Lorna Robley: 
Yeah. 
Christine Lewis: 
But it puts a strain though. 
Lorna Robley: 
But you know what happened too? I did it in the beginning because I didn't plan 
to stay, so, I said, "It's all right, I will just be ..." 
Christine Lewis: 
In the meantime, and that's wrong though, because it set it up for somebody 
else. I mean, no, [02:08:00] it's not true. 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
86
Lorna Robley: 
I set it up for myself.  
Christine Lewis: 
You set it up for yourself, because the other person will come and say, "I'm not 
working here, I'm not working [inaudible 02:08:04]." 
Lorna Robley: 
I am her first babysitter. 
Christine Lewis: 
Okay. 
Lorna Robley: 
She never had a babysitter before me. 
Christine Lewis: 
Okay, why have the freedom in the home to do as you please, it puts a pressure 
though because in the back of your mind, you're doing all this, and you're still 
not compensated. 
Lorna Robley: 
I think too she tell herself that I wasn't legal, wasn't straight. 
Christine Lewis: 
[inaudible 02:08:27]. 
Lorna Robley: 
Until it's [02:08:30] later, you know when you realize certain things and so I 
confronted her then, at times. 
Christine Lewis: 
And you ask her what? 
Lorna Robley: 
I told her, I said, "Listen to me." I said, "I asked you all for certain things." Like 
when we did weekends, I told her I wanted like $180, she gave me $150 and 
claimed that they didn't have no, she did two of them, they didn't have ... I had 
to sit down, I said, "I'm not [inaudible 02:08:55]." 
Christine Lewis: 
Okay. Not [inaudible 02:08:57]. Put that out there. [02:09:00] Because not 
everybody undocumented, thank you. 
Lorna Robley: 
First she give me a $50 raise. 
Christine Lewis: 
Increase. 
Lorna Robley: 
Increase, and then that was it. 
Christine Lewis: 
The base rent. The base salary. 
Lorna Robley: 
Yes, after that, nothing. I think all in all, I have a good working relationship with 
her, in the fact that she's not breathing down my throat, she is more out than 
in. 
Christine Lewis: 
Than in, right, right. 
Lorna Robley: 
As I say, I have the run of the house.  
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
87
Christine Lewis: 
Because you have the other side of that [02:09:30] story where the employer's 
inside, and you hear them say, "Oh, god, this man won't go outside, this woman 
won't go outside. Damn, he working from home." 
Lorna Robley: 
"She don't do anything." 
Christine Lewis: 
"He rubbing me the wrong way." 
Lorna Robley: 
She doesn't do anything without consulting me, so now I just have to say, 
"Today's my day off, why she texting me?" "We need anything in the house? We 
need any this? We need that?" But it's just the finances and the [02:10:00] 
stress of ... 
Section 13 of 15 
[02:00:00 - 02:10:04] 
Section 14 of 15 
[02:10:00 - 02:20:04] (NOTE: speaker names may be different in each section) 
Lorna: 
The stress of the autistic-   
Christine: 
The autistic behavior, not understand it.  
Lorna: 
Child.  
Christine: 
Yeah, because you're not a special need teacher. That's on the school.  
Lorna: 
He's getting older and has more responsibility.  
Christine: 
It's more money, too. If you don't address that, you'll eventually walk because 
you're right. He's getting older, he demands more.  
Lorna: 
Yes.  
Christine: 
You will have to start to speak up now.  
Lorna: 
It's not only demanding more. In out socially, like I tell you with his- 
Christine: 
On the train.  
Lorna: 
His sexuality [02:10:30] thing.  
Christine: 
Yeah, he exploring it, too.  
Lorna: 
It is- 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
88
Christine: 
It's uncomfortable, though.  
Lorna: 
That isn't even ... Because somebody could even take out my [inaudible 
02:10:40], I molest- 
Christine: 
From the boy.  
Lorna: 
That's right.  
Christine: 
Yeah, hello, we have wicked people. We have people who do those kind of 
things.  
Lorna: 
I say last time, I say you seen a black woman with a white young man telling 
what the penis ... What is going here? 
Christine: 
Could you imagine having to get up and announce.  
Lorna: 
Yes, I have to do it. That day [02:11:00] I did not have a choice. I had addressed 
right there in the cemetery and going into- 
Christine: 
You funny. You real funny.  
Lorna: 
42nd Street.  
Christine: 
Tell me now, I hear you mention other kids. Do you still have relationships with 
the other kids you care for? 
Lorna: 
No. I don't see any of them.  
Christine: 
No? You don't have a relationship with other kids? Not at all? 
Lorna: 
Mm-hmm (negative). I called. I went and, well, once at 65th and Madison when 
the parents separated, they moved. [02:11:30] When I back by the place, the 
doorman tell me oh, they have moved out.  
Christine: 
Okay, wow.  
Lorna: 
The first set, the one in Scarsdale, I called the father, I call one time to find out 
how and the father answered the phone and asked me what I want.  
Christine: 
Oh, really? 
Lorna: 
I said, nothing, I just, you know, wanted to see if the kids all right and 
everything.  
Christine: 
Oh, yeah, say, what you want. Wow. My folks call me all the time or email me or 
Facebook me, "'Christine, how are you doing? We [02:12:00] could meet for 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
89
dinner." This kids will call, "How you doing so we make comments on each 
other's pages." 
Lorna: 
I know babysitters right by me here that say they had dinner with the people.  
Christine: 
The first, listen, the kid I worked for in this country took me to dinner and 
revealed to me that he's gay. The very first kid I worked for in this country, took 
me to dinner, revealed to me, "Christine, I'm gay." He went to one of the old-
fashioned schools of upstate New York, took me to dinner. He was 23 at the 
time. Yeah, because [02:12:30] I know it was five when I started to work with 
him, five, four-and-a-half. He was 9 months old, so they kind of close and they 
grew up together, but he took me to dinner and reveal that to me. Could you 
imagine somebody calling you and telling you stop for a minute? 
Speaker 3: 
I'm sorry [inaudible 02:12:47] battery. Let's do the questions because this is a 
long interview, so I just want to see if you guys ... I don't want you to go crazy 
with your list, but are there a couple of [02:13:00] questions, just look at those 
and see if there's a few we can maybe kind of out[crosstalk 02:13:05]. 
Christine: 
All right, okay, yeah, because we close down the wire now.  
Speaker 3: 
Yeah.  
Christine: 
We pretty much close- 
Speaker 3: 
[inaudible 02:13:09].  
Christine: 
All right.  
Lorna: 
Oh, yes, it is.  
Christine: 
Oh, okay. Yeah, what time is it? 
Speaker 3: 
It's 8:30.  
Lorna: 
Oh, my God.  
Christine: 
Yeah, we had a long day.  
Speaker 3: 
You know this is just, it's a great interview and you're ... Thank you so much for 
all that you're- 
Christine: 
I know, yeah, she really ... You know what? This is your [inaudible 02:13:26], 
too. You had to cry, [02:13:30] you had to, yeah. That's what storytelling does, 
eh?  
Lorna: 
I mean it wasn't a [inaudible 02:13:37].  
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
90
Christine: 
Yeah.  
Speaker 3: 
Yeah, so maybe we could, maybe 16 I think we've talked about. Go ahead, go to 
14.  
Christine: 
Yeah, we don't have to do 16, because she talk about the [inaudible 02:13:49], 
right.  Yeah, you know, so we done now, right. We pretty much ... We could just 
make it a little [02:14:00] shorter, the conversation.  
Lorna: 
Oh, yes, oh, yes.  
Christine: 
I could ask her the question because we get the meat, I think we get a lot of 
meat on the bone, yeah.  
Speaker 3: 
I think a lot of question have been answered.  
Christine: 
Yeah, a lot of question have been- 
Speaker 3: 
Just in not this order.  
Christine: 
Yeah. She did, she really did.  
Speaker 3: 
Oh, yeah.  
Christine: 
You did the storytelling. I didn't really have to ... Yeah.  
Speaker 3: 
Do you want to talk about [inaudible 02:14:21] stuff? 
Christine: 
Yeah.  
Lorna: 
Oh, yes, we can do that and wrap up.  
Christine: 
Yeah, right. Right because I think she talk about the immigration [02:14:30] 
issue already. She talk about, right ... She had to let the lady know that she was 
legal.  
Lorna: 
Yes, oh, yes.  
Christine: 
Do you think ... Do you feel right, I'll go to 14. Yeah, I think we didn't. So we 
leave out these two questions because she talk about ... Right. Yeah, we don't 
have to ask her that, those two questions. You ready? 
Speaker 3: 
Mm-hmm (affirmative).  
Christine: 
We could go? Do you feel like the amount of hours you work and your holiday 
schedule are being respected? 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
91
Lorna: 
[02:15:00] No.  
Christine: 
Explain.  
Lorna: 
Because- 
Christine: 
Tell me more.  
Lorna: 
Before, she cut on my pay and I should have stand up for that, eh? You know, 
sometimes it just ...  
Speaker 3: 
What's that? 
Christine: 
You have another paper? I think this is one of your older papers. You want to 
give me that one? 
Speaker 3: 
Is that [02:15:30] the same thing? 
Christine: 
I didn't see the last question.  
Speaker 3: 
There's another page here.  
Christine: 
Really? 
Speaker 3: 
That's the DWU stuff.  
Christine: 
Let me see, okay.  
Speaker 3: 
It's the same thing.  
Christine: 
It's the same.  
Speaker 3: 
We could just compress that. You can ask her this question.  
Christine: 
All right, go ahead, all right, okay.  
Speaker 3: 
Then just compress the- 
Christine: 
All right, yeah.  
Speaker 3: 
Bill of rights- 
Christine: 
Right, right. All right, good.  
Speaker 3: 
What would you like changed? Yeah, this is a good question.  
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
92
Christine: 
Right. Finish up the question I asked.  
Lorna: 
What it was again? If [02:16:00] I take- 
Christine: 
If you feel your- 
Speaker 3: 
Hours are respected.  
Christine: 
Yeah.  
Lorna: 
Financially, no. Okay? Because I sometimes, as I said before, when she is out of 
the country and her job takes her out of the country a lot and the type of work 
she's doing, I know that she is getting paid for that and since I have to be there 
working with these boy children 24 hours a day, [02:16:30] I think that I deserve 
more, but she refuses to give it to me. Refuse. Not that ... I asked, she refused.  
Christine: 
How do you manage balancing your personal life, family life and your work life 
with having to live in when she goes away? You have a life. I know you have a 
life. How do you manage? 
Lorna: 
[02:17:00] I don't know. I don't have any romantic life, well, husband. I think 
that may be because that was one of the reason why I do what I do.  
Christine: 
I see.  
Lorna: 
It's not that I have somebody to go home to or a relationship going on in my life.  
There's just my kids and my grandchildren ... My granddaughter and myself. 
[02:17:30] I believe that's one of the reason why I do what I do, the way that I 
do it.  
Christine: 
Tell me, how you became a part of Domestic Workers United? 
Lorna: 
Working in ... Was it Scarsdale I was working? Or is it in the [inaudible 02:17:54] 
61st and Madison I met up with ... It's Joyce in the park [02:18:00] and they 
were talking about it and I ... Yes, I was working 61st and Madison and she give 
me the information, the literature that I put it in the stroller. That family I was 
working, it was two babysitters. They had two kids, two babysitters. Then one of 
the babysitters ... The other babysitter, she took the thing out of the stroller and 
went and show it to the [02:18:30] ... Thinking that, you know? 
Christine: 
Show it to who? 
Lorna: 
Show it to the woman, the boss.  
Christine: 
The employer? 
Lorna: 
The employer, yes.  
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
93
Christine: 
My lord, mm-hmm (affirmative).  
Lorna: 
She came and she asked me about it. I'm like, "It was given to me in the park."  
Christine: 
Wow.  
Lorna: 
I will go and see what it is all about. I was never afraid of confrontation.  
Christine: 
Could you imagine, though? Why would she come to ask you? It's your right. It's 
none of her business, though. I'm curious about [02:19:00] that because I hand 
out babysitters flyers every day and I could see those who are apprehensive. 
Again, the field Negros and house Negros, you couldn't read and write. Some of 
the employers trade treat the women, when you hand them the flyers, they fold 
it up, quick, quick, quick. I say, "It's not for your employer, it's for you." They all 
right, they all right. It's you that's not all right.  
Lorna: 
I never entertained the slave mentality. That's why I keep making them to 
understand that in my family, we have educated people.  
Christine: 
Of course, of [02:19:30] course.  
Lorna: 
My other brother who died, he was a teacher. He rose to the rank of principal of 
the school that he was teaching in.  
Christine: 
Teaching in.  
Lorna: 
My son is an attorney. The first thing, anytime we reached a confrontational 
path, the first thing I asked them if I need an attorney.  
Christine: 
Okay, all right, your son. Back to this question. When she asked you what it is 
about, how did she ask you? In what way did she ask you? 
Lorna: 
She just came to it [02:20:00] and asked me, "What is this?" I was taken back 
because ... 
Section 14 of 15 
[02:10:00 - 02:20:04] 
Section 15 of 15 
[02:20:00 - 02:31:55] (NOTE: speaker names may be different in each section) 
Lorna Robley: 
People ask me "what is this?" I was taken aback because, I wasn't expecting. You 
know... 
Christine Lewis: 
Could you imagine though? 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
94
Lorna Robley: 
The other girl to show her... 
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah, and that's all right. 
Lorna Robley: 
So I said, "I have no idea what it is, as of yet" because I didn't read it. But, it was 
given to me right away in the back. So, when I read it, I will let you know. 
Christine Lewis: 
And so you decided to come to the meetings. 
Lorna Robley: 
Yes. 
Christine Lewis: 
You followed up. So what has it meant for you, that the Domestic Bill of Rights 
[02:20:30] was passed in 2010. 
Lorna Robley: 
It meant everything because...It meant that now, we have somebody 
representing "us" and...I mean it is not a Union. A lot of other organizations that 
have Union that could represent them. 
Christine Lewis: 
Yes. 
Lorna Robley: 
So...This, as far as I look at it...It was like we had a little weapon, that we could 
go and tell our Employers [02:21:00] "hello" now we have the Bill of Rights that 
was passed. We are no longer, living in the shadow. You can no longer tell me, 
you can't tell me that I cannot get leave without pay...I cannot have vacation 
without pay. The most important thing was that. The hours of work. I no longer 
decided [02:21:30] to work from eight in the morning until ten in the night, until 
eleven in the night. 
Christine Lewis: 
Without pay, without overtime. 
Lorna Robley: 
Without giving me the overtime, and I got what I deserved. 
Christine Lewis: 
Good for you. 
Lorna Robley: 
So I stopped that. I made them [inaudible 02:21:42] Is eight hours, after that is 
overtime. 
Christine Lewis: 
Nice. 
Lorna Robley: 
And that is what I keep doing up to, today. 
Christine Lewis: 
So what would you like to see happen if you deal with the Bill of Rights. 
Lorna Robley: 
[02:22:00] That...Well I think right now, with the economy. That the minimal 
wage thing...Especially, babysitters. Dependent on your job description, for you 
to get a better wage. There is not "one pay" for equal, because there are many 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
95
of us, who work [02:22:30] different types of jobs in the Domestic Industry. In 
the home. 
Christine Lewis: 
And that is what. 
Lorna Robley: 
Because some Babysitters have to clean, some have to cook. 
Christine Lewis: 
No definition or guideline. 
Lorna Robley: 
Right. I mean...With me, I choose to cook, but I'm not cleaning. 
Christine Lewis: 
Okay, I see what you're saying. They have cleaners. 
Lorna Robley: 
Yes, they have somebody come in and clean. Like yesterday, she asked me to 
change her sheets. I said, "You have to pay me." 
Christine Lewis: 
[laughter] [inaudible 02:23:01] 
Lorna Robley: 
[02:23:00] No, she come up and she said...Oh I'll come back and...Because it's a 
big bed.  
Christine Lewis: 
Okay, and she says she'd do it. 
Lorna Robley: 
Yes, so I helped her...And then I told her how much she owed me. No, she's still 
not getting away. 
Christine Lewis: 
Okay, good for you. So from your perspective, why is the domestic work as 
important for domestic workers? 
Lorna Robley: 
Because we have...Just as I said, we have somebody that you can go to. You 
[02:23:30] have a place now, that you can go and let out that anxiety in your 
body. You know, like me...This anxiety sometimes you don't have anybody to 
talk to. 
Christine Lewis: 
Sure.  
Lorna Robley: 
Even though it's once a month, we can at least come together as the same body 
of people and talk about the similar things that we are going through, and 
relieve some of [02:24:00] that stress. There are a lot of us who live by 
ourselves, there are a lot of Babysitters in this country that live alone. 
Christine Lewis: 
That don't have family members? 
Lorna Robley: 
That live alone, that don't have family members here. They have nobody to talk 
to and then they can't call home and say what they are going through...Because 
you see how long it takes to tell my story?

Christine Lewis: 
Okay, it sure did. 
Lorna Robley: 
They understand what...Three or four [inaudible 02:24:24] and they don't have 
that amount of money. 
Christine Lewis: 
Okay. 
Lorna Robley: 
Therefor to do that. You know, [02:24:30] some of them just need once. The 
home, to know what kind of living condition they are working under.  
Christine Lewis: 
So true, what a shame. Number one you leave there, some of us might even 
have money stored up, God forbid to even go back home. So again, it's a shame. 
Lorna Robley: 
That is exactly so. 
Christine Lewis: 
I agree. Some people want to go back and have nowhere to begin.  
 
What would you want the Legislators to know? If you had to talk about 
[02:25:00] domestic work and you know the Bill of Rights passing. What would 
you want the Legislators to know, at this point. 
Lorna Robley: 
That there are lots of people who are employing, women of color and Latino's to 
work in their home and they're not treating them properly. They are just putting 
up a front, we need to get out from under the shadows. [02:25:30] We need to 
let these people know that you are employing people in your home, and you 
need to treat them better and give them a fair wage. 
Christine Lewis: 
So I guess at this area of life, what area or skill are you looking to gain? I should 
ask you that. I know you're gifted and talented. 
Lorna Robley: 
Right now? 
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah. 
Lorna Robley: 
To go back to school?  
Speaker 3: 
It could just be a skill. 
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah, it could be a skill, it doesn't [02:26:00] have to be....You already have 
skills. 
Speaker 3: 
Some people, sometimes they want to learn a new language. 
Christine Lewis: 
I think you said it...Travel. 
Lorna Robley: 
I would like to do the EMT.

Christine Lewis: 
You still want to do it. 
Lorna Robley: 
Yes, yes. 
Christine Lewis: 
Okay, It's never too late. 
Lorna Robley: 
No, I still want to do that EMT job. 
Christine Lewis: 
It's never too late. What skill if any, did DW teach you and what type of training. 
[02:26:30] What did DW give to you...what do you feel they gifted to you. 
Lorna Robley: 
A sense of...Freedom of expression. You know, because...You came in...I should 
also say bravery, because you come in and you're hearing some of these women 
[02:27:00] saying the things they are going through in their jobs. You know that 
they have to take it because a lot of them have their children back home. Some 
of them don't even have their children here and had to leave their children. My 
one was all grown, but still, it doesn't matter how grown they still need in crisis 
their Mother in their life.  
 
[02:27:30] When you come in and hear that, you feel a sense of strength. You 
want to take on these people in a way. I used to go to work with [inaudible 
02:27:48]. You are not going to "do me." 
Christine Lewis: 
As, you want...Not today. 
Lorna Robley: 
Not today. 
Christine Lewis: 
They empowered you. 
Lorna Robley: 
Empowered, that's right. That's the word, they empowered [02:28:00] me. 
Christine Lewis: 
We're down to the wire. What would you...What last words, you want to send 
out to anyone who is listening to this interview, passing by the Library of 
Congress and tapping to [inaudible 02:28:15] What do you want to share, what 
do you want to see? What is the last part in [inaudible 02:28:19] that you want 
to give? 
Lorna Robley: 
To the Domestic Workers [02:28:30] United that I have become a part of...The 
"uplift ment" I have gotten from a lot of the women of the organization. To just 
let people know that, you allow people to do you...Sometimes [02:29:00] we 
allow people to "do us" the things that they "do us." There are things that we 
suffer for and it's not out of...because you are stupid or that you are 
uneducated. It is because [02:29:30] of love.  
 
Some people might take your kindness for stupidity. So you go into these 
people's homes, and you go in with a love that you got from your Grandmother, 
in the country that you were born. Some of us were born out of love, and we

didn't come here to work in people's [02:30:00] houses...Because a lot of us 
leave our country with skills. Some of us are Nurses, some of us are Firemen. 
One of my brothers is a Fireman. He ended up coming here and not working, 
and driving bus. People might look at you and feel like, oh she's just form the 
island, she's from a third world country.  
 
No. [02:30:30] We can teach I'm sure, people how to live, how to run their 
homes, how to bring up their children with respect. As undaunting as we may 
look. We have a lot to share, we have a lot of love. We have a lot of patients, I 
[02:31:00] think it all comes from the way that we were brought up. We were 
brought up with...To respect and that is one of the things that is lacking mostly 
in this country. Respect. There's no respect anymore...Especially in the young 
generation, and it is "we" Caribbean women who are teaching the children 
[02:31:30] in this country to show respect. 
Christine Lewis: 
Thank you, thank you, thank you Lorna. 
Speaker 3: 
Wow, thank you. That's amazing. 
Christine Lewis: 
Heavy, powerful. Every story has a different confidant.
