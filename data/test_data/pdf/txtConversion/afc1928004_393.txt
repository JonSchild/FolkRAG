BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH 
OF THE 
BARLOW BROTHERS. 
__t ot 
THE Variety profession possesses many performers of ac-
knowledged ability, but there are none who are more deserv-
ing of public ettlegium than the subjectsif thi 
seteii. 
They 
were born at Mt. Savage, a village a 
few miles from Cum-
berland, Alleghany Co., Maryland. 
James was born April 26th, 
1851, and William was born February 1 
1th. 1853. 
When they 
were quite young, their parents moved to Pittsburg, where 
they ( the Barlows) entered the glass factory and learned the 
trade of glass-blowing, which they followed for a 
few years. 
But manifesting considerable talon t 
for the stage, they succeeded 
in obtaining an engagement from the old veteran, Charles 
'White ( who was then playing at the old Drury Theater) to open 
with him in Boston at Morris Bros. Opera- llouse, where they 
made a 
decided hit as clog dancers. 
In 1871 they joined the 
famous Morris Bro's. Minstrels, and traveled with them for 
two seasons, doing songs and dances and jigs. 
Since then they 
traveled through the principal cities of the United States and 
Canada, and achieved a 
reputation which is invulnerable. They 
have since connected themselves with various combinations. 
In conjunction with William Carleton, the cornique and Irish 
singer, took a 
company on the road under the name of Comet 
Comb nation, which run very successful for one season; later 
with Charles Bartine's Circus and Barlow Brothers Novelty 
Company; ruid lastly with Pat Rooney's Combination, which 
comprised some of the brightest soars of the profession. 
They 
are the originators of their different styles of dancing. 
Their 
Clock Work Jig has been pronounced by the profession, press 
and public to be a 
masterpiec of art. 
Their songs and dances 
are a 
true representation of plantation life, and are undoubtedly 
the finest in their line. 
Their Burlesque Prize Fight is origi-
nal, and is considered to be the most ludicrous act on the stage. 
They are recognized both in and out of the profession as thor-
ough gentlemen and universal favorites. 
As lack of space will 
not allow me to narrate the many incidents in their profess 
sionuieareer, I 
will now close,

THE FOLLOWING ARE A FEW OF THE MANY 
COMPLIMENTS OF THE PRESS. 
The dancing of the BARLOW BROTHERS is a 
wonderful exhi-
bition of the result of careful training. 
They move as if ani-
mated by one soul, and controlled by, one brain.—Norristown 
Herald. 
The great champion jig- dancers of the United States, the 
BARLOW BitomEus, take the p 
ace by storm on each appearance. 
Their popularity increases as their engagement progresses.— St. 
Louis Times. 
The BARLOW BROTHERS are the finest in their line that has 
ever appeared on the Adelphi Stage.— Buffalo Express. 
The BARLOW BROTHERS were seen in a 
double-jig, conspicu-
ous by reason of the great variety of steps introduced, and for 
the excellence of time maintained — Kew York Clipper. 
The BARLOW BROTHERS are two of the best dancers we have 
ever seen, particularly in their double-jig, which never fails to 
bring down the house; but if you want to laugh until the tears 
roll down your cheeks, every button in danger of being torn 
from its fastening, and your throat almost ready to burst, just 
go and see their Sparring Act. 
It is the funniest thing ever 
given here.— The Buffalo Evening Post. 
The singing and dancing of the BARLOW BROTHERS are clever, 
and a 
number of encores are accorded them nightly.—.New York 
Clipper. 
The BARLOW BROTHERS are two of the most artistic song and 
dance men in the country.— The Ballo Bee. 
The burlesque prize fight of the 13.taLow BROTHERS is a 
big 
card.— Cleveland Leader. 
The BARLOW BROTHERS in their eccentric song and dance, 
" 
Black and Tans," introducing their original prize fight. 
No 
better actors walk the stage in their line. 
They are, in them-
selves, a 
whole show.— Columbus Statesman. 
The BARLOW BROTHERS, as song and dance men, have few 
equals, and i 
one superior.— Columbus Sunday Herald. 
The BARLOW BROTHERS are very clever performers, and their 
Eihcopian song and dance and double-jig were artistically given. 
—Providence Press. 
Among the notable features of the company are the BARLOW 
BROTHERS, excellent dancers and comic actors.—Providence 
Daily Journal. 
The big card at Trimbles last week was undoubtedly the 
BARLOW BROTHERS, who, besides their comic and artistic danc-
ing, have the additional prestage of being Pittsburghers, anti 
universal favorites here,— The Pittsburvh ?Sunday Leader, 
CABIN FLOOR. 
5 
An original Song and Dance, sung by BARLOW BROTHERS at 
Harrigan & Hart's and Tony Pastor's Theatres. 
WHEX we were two little coons, 
On old Virginia shore, 
The old man showed us how to dance 
Upon the cabin floor; 
The steps he learned us how to take, 
We'll show them now to you, 
And this is how we done it, 
Before we wore a 
shoe. 
CHORUS. 
The old man learned us this rap, 
[Sym.] 
He made our toes flv flip-flap, 
[Spit. 
Our education we did get; 
In happy days gone by, 
Old mother she would laugh at us, 
Until she'd almost cry; 
I 
wish those days would come again, 
Thosc happy days of yore, 
When first we learned how to dance, 
Upon the cabin floor. 
When we hear the music play, 
We like to get a 
dance, 
To knock the dust out of the cracks, 
Because we love to dance; 
And when we get so very old, 
That we can't dance no more, 
We hope our bones will get a 
rest, 
Beneath the cabin floor. 
The old man, etc.

DOUBLE CLOCK WORKING DARKIES. 
Respectfully dedicated to my friends, BARLOW TIaommts, 
by THOMAS W INNETT. 
W ERE the double dancing darkies, 
'\Vith movements just the same ; 
Our " Wonderful Clock Working Jig" 
Has gained for us great fame. 
Our steps they have a 
finish, 
So artistically they're done; 
We work so well together that 
They say we are one. 
When we appear and make our bow, 
A 
grand reception greets us; 
We accomplish with ease the most difficult steps, 
Which proves that none can beat us. 
Like lightning rapidity our feet do fly 
To sweet strains from the band ; 
Impossible seems the execution 
Through radiant silver sand. 
Our " Slender Mokes" is ludicrous, 
And " Quit Dat," " Let Me Be." 
Our figure stands for number eleven, 
As you can plainly see. 
Our dashing style par excellence, 
Like Hildebrandt Montrose ; 
We trol-er-la-lar upon Broadway, 
And dine at Delmanico's, 
7 
LEAN AND GENTEEL GUARD. 
Written and performed by BARLOW BROTIIERS at all of the 
Vaudeville Theaters. 
W E'RE gallant soldiers, true as steel. 
And take the part from head to heel; 
Our uniforms, so trim and clean, 
The finest that was ever seen; 
The people laugh and call us lean, 
We know we are genteel. 
[Synt.] 
We march down the street with colors gaily flying, 
Our forms and style so neat sets all tire girls a 
sighing; 
Such martial figures grand, to beat us is very hard 
As we march behind our band in the lean and genteel guards. 
We do not fear the war's alarm, 
For safe at home we're free from harm: 
That others mingle in the fight, 
And strive in battle day and night, 
We do not think such conduct right; 
Besides, 'tis much too warm. 
We march down the street, etc. 
S 
NORAH O'MILLIGEN, 
As sung by the 13Aanow BROTHERS. 
On Norah 0-Milligen, say that you willigen, 
Promise you'll surely be mine; 
Darling, so dear to me, sit you down near to me. 
Cling to me love, like a 
vine. 
CHORUS. 
Oh ! oh! Norah O'Nfilligen, say, say, say, that you willigen, 
Ali ! Mrs. O'Milligen, promise that you'll surely be mine, 
Oh! oh! darling, so dear to me, come, come, sit you down near 
to me, 
Ali I 
ah! come over here to me, cling to me like a 
vine. 
I'll buy you red dresses, and silk for your tresses, 
And ribbons to tie up your hair, 
And once every year, without any fear, 
I'll take you to Donnybrook Fair. 
Oh! oh! etc. 
Norah, my only love, gentle and turtle-dove, 
Norah, the sweetest and best; 
We'll live like two banties in our own little shanty, 
Just like two doves in a 
nest. 
Oh! oh! etc.

POOR WHITE SLAVE. 
By HARRY BURNS. 
AiR.—Slavery Days. 
TOILING slowly, day by day, ' till his life has pass'd away, 
And they give him scarcely room to lay his head; 
He drudges, morn and night, to earn his scanty bite ; 
All his luxuries are water, scorn and bread. 
They never sing his praise ' cept on election days ; 
And they often call him scoundrel, tramp or knave; 
All the world may keep him down with many a 
sullen frown— 
He is nothing only a 
poor white slave. 
Cuoaus. 
No matter where it be still he never can be free; 
The poor will ever have to stoop and crave. 
His coat is ragged, tore, let us kick him from the door— 
He is nothing only a 
poor white slave. 
Great Beecher tells the poor they are well enough, he's sure, 
If they get but bread and water all the while. 
If ever there is a 
hell they'll chuck him in pell mell ; 
He will surely get the middle of the pile. 
We never look for joy, there's none for you or I; 
Still how our suffering hearts try to be brave ; 
How it makes the tear- drops fall when they tell us after all 
We are nothing only a 
poor white slave. 
No matter where it be, etc. 
Those with riches hold full sway for their millions gaineth day; 
It has been our valiant legislator's boast, 
The slaves may put me in, but I'm sure ' twill be no sin, 
To always work for those who pay the most; 
Yet, still we can forgive, ' tis only while we live, 
When this mortal life is passing at the grave; 
Then we'll surely bless the day we so often heard them say 
He is nothing only a 
poor white slave. 
No matter where it be, etc.

THERE'S ONLY ONE, 
By HARRY BURNS. 
IN 
all this wide world with its dazzle and glow 
There's only one heart that I 
love here below; 
There's only one spirit looks kindly in mine 
And tells me its motions are true and devine; 
Only one pair of sweet, dark loving eyes, 
That lifts my poor soul from this filth to the skies. 
There's only one name that I 
love for to say; 
There's only one thought in my heart day by day; 
There's only one sweet loving face that I 
see, 
And it haunts me with pleasure wherever I 
be; 
Whenever it's absent it fills me with pain, 
Oh I 
then how I 
long for its presence again. 
But tell me, sweet heart, will you always be true 
And cherish sweet thoughts for the one who loves you? 
Or will you, like others, be cruel and cold, 
And forget those fond words you so often have told; 
Fond words that my heart breathes with joyous delight. 
And fills me with bliss even morn. noon and night. 
Sweet darling, 
pray, take my poor heart in store, 
And tell me your love will be true evermore; 
But why should I 
ask when your eyes silent speak 
And tell me so plainly the wish that I 
seek; 
In all this wide world. wherever you be, 
You're the same happy, darling sweet creature to me.

BETTER THAN '
GOLD, 
BY HARRY BURNS. 
Written for A. 
L—IE. 
A IR —" Kiss Me A.gain." 
ONE in this bright world to me is fair, 
Voice like an angel and dark flowing hair. 
Sweetly does life give moments of bliss, 
Sealing our love with an angelic kiss. 
Swiftly the moments are passing away, 
Quickly the dawn of life is turning gray; 
But every moment, as life is growing old, 
Tells me I 
love you far better than gold. 
CHORUS. 
Better than gold with sweet thoughts I 
love thee, 
Nothing can ever unfold, 
Better than gold with feelings untold; 
Darling, I 
love you far better than gold. 
When your dark eyes are beaming in mine, 
Firing my heart like the nectar of wine, 
Thou art ever the same unto me, 
Filling my bosom with love's ecstacy, 
Wafting my soul to the realms of the blest, 
Passing and leaving love's wild unrest; 
Then if you love me why treat me so cold ? 
Whom my heart praises far better than gold. 
Better than gold, etc. 
Would you still love, through trouble and woe ? 
Follow my footsteps wherever I 
go ? 
Ever to thee my poor heart will cling, 
Loving and trusting whatever may bring. 
Let ill betide or lay at thy door, 
Still I 
will love thee the same evermore. 
All the sweet secrets my heart can unfold 
Tells me I 
love you far better than gold. 
Better than gold, etc.

There's a 
Sweet Face at the Window. 
By HARRY BURNS. 
There's a 
sweet face at the window, 
And it's looking o'er at me, 
Till its glances soft and loving 
Fills my soul with ecstacy, 
And its pretty eyes are blending 
Like the moon- lit sky when blue 
With its radiance transcending 
Like the rainbow's lovely hue. 
CHORUS. 
There's a 
sweet face at the window, 
See it glancing, through the pane. 
And my heart is sadly waiting 
Till I 
see it once again. 
There is music softly flowing. 
From those sweet hips thro' the air 
And my heart with love is glowing 
For that sweet face over there, 
Arid its melody is sound:rig, 
Till I 
feel its joyous thrill, 
And my spirit quickly bounding 
To its music sweet and still. 
There's a 
sweet face, etc. 
Yes, your eyes of dark blue flashing, 
Sends me feeling so divine, 
You who are so handsome, dashing, 
That I 
love to call you mine : 
And your sweet face at the window, 
How it haunts me in my dreams! 
Then how sad when I 
awaken 
Finding life not what it seems. 
There's a 
sweet face, etc. 
'Tis your sweet face at the window 
That is ever in my view, 
And it fills me o'er with gladness. 
For my thoughts are all for you ; 
Yes, my thoughts are always flying 
To the one I 
love so dear, 
And my heart is sadly sighing 
For that sweet face over there. 
There's a 
sweet face, etc. 
THE BLACK AND TANS. 
Written and Composed by W. GROGAN, and respectfully 
dedicated to the Monarchs of tong and Dance, 
CAMERON BROTHERS. 
JUST gaze upon us happy nigs 
For the little time we'll stay, 
We'll do our best to please you all. 
Before we go away; 
We are happy while we're singing, 
And in dancing take delight, 
For that's the way we occupy our time. 
CHORUS. 
It is the exclamation of the white folks far and near, 
We create a 
great sensation wherever we appear; 
Our style is very taking, and our execution neat, 
We're the Black and Tans from Alabama State. 
Alabama is our home, 
And there we long to be, 
That place we soon deserted, 
When of bondage we got free, 
But soon we will return again, 
And there we're going to stay, 
Until our days to shake the hoof are done. 
It is the exclamation, etc. 
The " Liver Eaters " gave a 
ball 
On the other side of town, 
South Fifth Avenue was aroused, 
And the neighborhood all around; 
We went there dressed up in our best. 
To show them what we could do. 
And we look the" Cake - with the citron in. you bet! 
It is the exclamation, etc.

BIG LONG JOHN, 
As sung by L. ScuooLcuIrr. 
BIG long John was a 
Chinaman, 
And he lived in the land of the free, 
He peddled cigarettes on the upperland, 
Way out in Milwaukee. 
He could eat more hash than a 
free lunch cadet, 
And he never was late to his meals, 
Ile wore a 
long tail from the top of his head, 
Which hung way down to his heels. 
CHORUS. 
Ching, citing, chum, chow ching a 
ring a 
rue, 
Long John was a 
Chinaman, 
He is a 
barber by birth and a 
butcher by trade, 
I 
tell you he oil from the can. 
Ile went to San Franc!sco for a 
Chinee gal to see, 
Feeling tired, he laid down to rest 
Beneath the shade of a 
huckleberry tree, 
lie feeling very warm soon feel asleep, 
And he laid his head on a 
plank, 
Along came an Indian with a 
big tomahawk, 
And chopped off a 
piece of his scalp. 
Ching, Ching, Chum, &c. 
Now when he awo':e he felt so had, 
That he hollered with all his might, 
Put his hand to his head and it made him so sick, 
That he died that very same night. 
Ile was found next day about 12 M. 
By the captain of a 
Hong Kong crew; 
lie wrote to his sweetheart, Chum Chum Fee, 
That he died from loss of his cue.

HE'S GOIN' AWAY TO LEAVE ME NOW. 
Written by Joe Banks, and sung by "The Banks" 
Music by C. J. Miers. 
He's going away to leave me now; 
To cross the ocean wave, 
To that land that's called "America," 
Where no man is a 
slave, 
To follow in the footsteps 
Of the thousands gone before, 
Who by dint of honest industry 
Laid by their little store, 
Where Ireland's exiled patriots 
Will greet him as he lands, 
And give " cacti mille'a failtha" 
By the grasp of honest hands. 
But where'er he be, on bind or sea, 
he'll not forget " the while," 
That " bit of earth" that gave him birth 
Our own dear " native Isle," 
Thowrii oceans may divide us, still 
I 
will be true to him, 
He's going away to leave me now, 
And my heart is filled with pain, 
For it may be many years before 
I'll look on him ag.in ; 
0, he kissed me when we puled, 
And pressed me to his breast ; 
"Acushla macree"—be true to me, 
His tears choked down the rest. 
All angels guard and bless him, 
And keep him for my sake, 
Is the prayer that I 
will offer up 
To him that did us make : 
But where'er he be, on land or sea, 
he'll not forget the while, 
That bit o' earth that gave him birth 
Our own dear native Isle, 
Though oceans may divide us, still 
I 
will be true to him.

JOG ALONG, BOYS, 
Sung by LEW TimmoNs. 
FROM me no dole-a-ful dirge you'll hear, 
To make you sad or leave you queer. 
But if you're dull this chant of mine, 
Will wake you up like sparkling wine. 
Ups and downs in life I've seen, 
Lucky and unlucky been, 
But wrong or rigi t, or right or wrong, 
This is the burthen of my song.

Gives me a 
name for noise and fun.

When the sun is sinking low, 
Helter, skelter, out we go, 
A 
jolly dinner is the thing, 
And a-; we pass the wine we sing, 
Jog along, jog along, &c. 
Then to the music halls we post, 
And visit those we like the most, 
There in stalls our weeds we smoke, 
And shout encore to song and joke. 
Ballet pets are in our way, 
We throw the prettiest a 
bouquet, 
Eau de vie, we gaily draia, 
And then why off we start again. 
Jog along, jog along, &c, 
The small hours now are drawing nigh, 
And supper, supper, is the cry; 
Then Lobster salads disappear, 
With oysters, stout and lager beer, 
Deviled chicken, kidneys too, 
A 
glorious bowl of punch we brew, 
Clinking glasses gaily sound, 
While our merry chaunt goes round. 
Jog along, jog along, Sze.

LAUGH ALL YOUR TROUBLES AWAY, 
Copyright 1875, by J. Nasit. 
SOME veople are born disconteni ed I 
think, 
No matter what station they hold, 
Be they rich, be they poor, they are dissatisfied 
With the lot fortune to them has doled; 
They're sure to find fault with the most trivial things 
And they alwa)s seem full of dismay, 
But its best to be cheerful and ha py like me, 
And laugh all your troubles away. 
CITORus. 
It's best to be cheerful and happy like me, 
It's best to be merry and gay, 
It's best to take things just the same as they co, 
And laugh all your trolbles away. 
Some grumble because things are no: to their in!...(14 . 
And others at what they have got, 
Some grumble at trouble they've brought on therrisebe, 
And others at no matter what ; 
They're always in trouble for trouble they make, 
And they meet trouble more than half way, 
But it's best to take things just the same as they 
And laugh all your troubles away. 
It's best, &c. 
I've tasted misfortune in every way, 
Been kicked out of the house for the rent, 
One day I've had money and dress'd like a 
lord, 
And another day not worth a 
cent, 
But still I'm content as a 
king on his throne, 
And l'm happy by nignt and by day, 
For I 
always take things just the same as they come. 
And I 
laugh all my troubles away. 
It's best, &c.

Banjo Solo as sung by BILLY R

M going to sing a 
little song, 
It's nonsense you'll agree, 
But then you know the wisest men, 
Must sometimes merry be. 
My subject is the many songs, 
You hear now every day, 
So with my rhymes the music chimes, 
It's good I 
hope you'll say. 
There's Mollie Bawn goas walking cut, 
When the Band begins to play, 
Oh, give me back my Arab steed, 
For I 
could not stay away; 
Josephus Orange Blossom says, 
Pour out the good Rhine wine, 
For the Old Man Le is Drunk Again, 
And still you wonder at Crime. 
Off Like a 
Rocket went Captain Jinks, 
Oh, Johnny, quit your tricks, 
My little German Band's gone up, 
So I'll stiek to Mortar and Bricks;

Oh. Will you Love me then as now,

And now but feel a

To share my life as well. 
In ignorance I 
sealed my fate, 
And so, alas, I 
fell. 
My father turned me from his door, 
And cruel words he said ;

THE MAN WITH THE MONKEY. 
MY trouble is a 
female, one I 
met just like a 
dream, 
And tho' she was a 
milkmaid, of all milkmaids was the crelm; 
te' P 
To me her can seemed silver, and her cotton dress a 
silk; 
I 
cottoned to her, when I 
first heard her sweet voice crying; 
Milk! 
CuoRus. 
Ding-dong goes the bell, I'm a 
most unfortunate flunkey: 
I 
loved a 
girl that didn't love me, " cos" she loved a 
man wit : i 
a 
monkey! 
Now, all went on like a 
clock till, one sad wr.etched day, 
As we went out to take a 
walk, I 
saw her start and say, 
Oh, dear! look at that monkey, do; and his master ain't he 
clever ? 
He's fencing with him on his drum: oh! did you ever, ever! 
Ding-dong goes the bell, &c. 
I 
gave this monkey-man a 
cent,to go and get a 
drink; 
lie bowed and shrugged his shoulders then and tipped my girl 
the wink. 
Said I: Now, Mounseer, none of that—or I 
will punch your head, 
Pardon, Mounseer, me no mean to offend, the fellow said. 
Plug-Doug goes the hell? &c,

Just then some fellow smashed my hat, and when I 
turned 
around 
(
My milkmaid and the monkey-man was 110 where to be found: 
- 
This got my MONKEY up, of course, and like a 
desperate flunkey, 
Said: I 
By gar! he's got my girl, I'll have his infernal monkey ! 
Ding-Dong goes the bell, &c. 
This monkey with the monkey-man and my girl the wretched 
three, 
I 
met to-day, and into them I 
pitched right manfully. 
My milkmaid fainted with alarm, on the monkey-man I 
got

Dedicated to GEO.

FA 
iiEwELL, dear Erin, I 
now must leave thee, 
With good heart I'll bear it, if ' tis fate's decree; 
With a 
burden of sorrow, an exile I 
roam, 
Through cruel misfortune I'm driven from home. 
My aged, lonely mother I 
leave in despair, 
Who is helpless and feeble from sorrow and care. 
II ordship and trouble we long did endure, 
I 
leave Ireland and Mother because IA e 
are poor. 
To racet on the past it occasions regret, 
The days of my boyhood I 
ne'er can forget; 
The home that my father left mother and T, 
We now must abandon. and are turned out to die. 
Farewell, to your valleys and moss-bordered stream, 
Your mountains so lofty, and meadows so green, 
The place of my birth, darling sweet Donaghmore, 
I 
leave Ireland and Mother because we are poor. 
When leaving my mother she grieved we should part, 
She said separation almost broke her heart. 
My blessing be with you, prosperity attain, 
Is the wish of a 
mother you may ne'er see again; 
She filled with emotion, it pained her to speak, 
As the large pearly tears coursed down her pale cheek. 
With a 
parting farewell, at our old cottage door, 
I 
leave Ireland and Mother because we are poor.

MARY ANN HASLETT. 
Am.—Dark- eyed Sailor. 
Written by W. J. GROGAN, and sung by him, with tremendous 
applause, in his version of the sketch " Wit° 
OWNS THE ASH BARREL." 
A vEttv sad occurrence I'll endeavor to relate, 
That betel a 
pretty female in Jersey State, 
Which neither judge or jury e'er did investigate; 
rwas the collapse of the female smuggler,— 
The assassination of the female smuggler, 
Vivo Vivimus O'Reilly. 
This Mary Ann Haslett a 
true lover had, 
Who's occupation was selling shad; 
On poor Mary Ann he was clean gone mad, 
Mary Ann's dilapidated lover,— 
Mary Ann's " Nom Comptis Mends" lover, 
Patriae pietatis, imago McFarlane. 
Tie asked Mary Ann to become his wife, 
She answered in the negative, which caused great strife; 
lie swore by the Court House he would take the life 
Of the infatuating female smuggler,— 
Of this heart-breaking female smuggler, 
Detectundo pariter, quo Monendo Cusick. 
Her lover went down stairs to the very house-top, 
And from beneath a

UP A 
TREE. 
As Sang by TONY PASTOR. 
YOU see before you one who's been, 
In life throiedi ninny a 
changing scene ; 
And yet withal a 
little green, 
Of course I 
know it now. 
A 
Itho' I've been unfortunate, 
in 
will allow Me CO 
relate, 
That 01 lee I owned a 
large estate, 
'T was then friends used to bow. 
Dear Jack, old Noy," they then would say, 
I'm pr i 
eel of such a 
meeting ; 
how do you do ? where have you been ? 
Ymn. looking well I 
see ; 
But now they've grown so very shy, 
They can't ; Ilford a 
greeting— 
in vulgar phraseology, 
Because I'm up a 
tree. 
I 
once could give good dinners, 
'twas then the hungry sinners, 
Would haunt my [ alit'. daily, 
Praise my judgment, jokes and wine, 
Join in con-vi-vi-ality, 
Accept my hospi-tal-1_t, 
Until Orough prodiga-h-ty, 
My fortune did decline. 
And so did they, for one by one, 
They left me in my glory ; 
A friend I 
stood in need of 
But not one could I 
see— 
My money gone and so had they--
Well ' tis the same old story, 
So while you have it keep it, 
Or you'll soon be up a 
tree. 
I 
once could drive my four-In-hand, 
had money too at my command. 
Could do the grand— you understand--
I 
low fo6lish I 
have been. 
I 
stand here to exemplify', 
Sweet uses of adversity ; 
To prove my friends in poverty— 
Acquaintances, I 
mean. 
Better times may come again, 
A 
leson ' twill have taught me. 
Preserve me from my friends, 
For the future it shall be : 
I've paid for my experience tho'. 
You see to what its broicrht me--
I'm a 
sadder yet a 
wiser man, 
Although I'm up a 
tree.

Now I 
went out the other night 
Upon a 
bit of spree, you know, 
A 
Policeman did soon request 
That I 
with him should quickly go. 
I 
swore a

TONY'S TELEGRAMS. 
As sung by TONY l'ArsTOR. 
Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1874, by A. J. 
FISHER, in Office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington. 
I 
AM going to tell a 
curious yarn, if you'll listen unto me, 
I 
have all the late dispatches, that have come across the sea; 
And I'm certain I 
will do my best to make this audience laugh; 
When they hear 
the 
funny messages, sent through my 
telegraph ; 
Ilere's the latest by the cable, which to Europe now is laid. 
The King of Spain has cleared out, and quick tracks for home 
has Made, 
The Flag of Freedom's spreading, and our battle will be won , 
In spite of king or Kaiser, Chassepot, or Needle Gun. 
They want " Home Rule " in Ireland, which I 
hope they'll soon 
obtain ; 
So that the flag of Sarstield may in triumph wave again. 
The Treasury has been robbed again—old Pomeroy's in the 
shade; 
The Italians on the peanut stands have made a 
furious raid; 
The grizzly bear has had a 
lit—Sumner's now a 
Tammany 
man. 
We are all going straight to glory, now the waiter girls are 
gone. 
Harriet Beecher Stowe and Byron's ghost their troubles have 
smoothed o'er, 
The Committee of 70's frightened Belzebub as the devil is no 
more, 
43 
Our Congressmen are honest, they won't take what they can-
not reach, 
Tennie Claflin to the darkies now her funny drill does teach; 
John Bull has got the " Jim Jams " a 
complaint he's often had 
before, 
Because we get the Alabama claims although we should have 
more, 
harry Stanley has found Livingstone, Tony Hartman's won a 
prize— 
Through " burstin" the Revere House, eating forty oyster pies 
The Christian Association has just received a 
shock, 
For old Bill Tovee's joined them since be left " Around the 
Clock." 
There will be fighting soon in India—then the people's chance 
will be 
To help the Bear of Russia and set, ould Ireland free. 
Up in a 
Baloon went Col ax, for the people he has fleeced, 
have sent him to his turnip farm, among the saints down East: 
But now I 
think its time to stop, yet each and every day 
I'll sing my latest telegrams as they flash across the set-L— 
IT change them for you often, so I 
hope you'll not refuse 
To often give my place a 
call, and hear the latest news, 
MRS. MURPHY'S SLEIGHING PARTY. 
Entered according to the Act of Congress, in the year 1874, by A. J. 
FISHER, in the Office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington. 
MRS. MURPHY kept a 
grocery store, upon the boulevard, 
And one night for myself and frienas, a 
great feast she 
prepared, 
I 
never shall forget that time, it was a 
wintry night. 
When we engaged that four- horse sleigh, and started with 
delight. 
SPOKEN.—Yes! we all arranged to have a 
jolly time, 
Mrs. Murphy supplied the hash, and we found the whisky. 
So I 
went among my acquaintances to make up the party, 
And a 
finer lot of boys and girls never started on a 
trip to-
gether, such hugging and loving as there was in that sleigh, 
I 
can scarcely describe. These are the names of the crowd. 
CHORUS. 
There was Sam and Mick, and Pat and Dick, and Bill, with 
the carroty hair, 
There was Sue and Sal, and Bridget and Nell and Lucy, so 
pretty and fair, 
First Sam kissed Sal, then Dick kissed Nell, 
And Bill with the carroty hair, kissed Lucy so pretty and 
fair, 
But I 
with Kitty, the charming girl, of hugging I 
took my 
share. 
We started in the greatest glee, a 
merry laughing party, 
We kissed and joked, and joked and kissed, and sung with 
voices loud, 
Till just beyond the Central Park, we overboard did go, 
Our drunken driver for a 
lark, he pitched us in the snow. 
45 
spolum.—And of all the screeching that ever you heard, 
our gals beat it by chalks. 
It seem'd as if by mutual con-
sent, all the men folks went into the snow-drift, and the 
gals after them. 
Sally Cassidy made a 
tenstrike with her 
bustle on Sam Jones' nose, while Sue Snyder stuck fast in 
the bank wrong side up, doing the manual exercise with 
her garters. 
Mickey Kelly and Lucy Jones got tied to-
gether in a 
sailor's slip knot. it took us ten minutes to un-
ravel them. As for me, I 
struck Sally Smith so hard with 
my corporosity, I 
drove her down into the drift like a 
spile 
and we thought for some time, she'd have to lay there 
till spring and get thawed out, 
But at last we got fixed all 
right again for another start, and off we went, both 
Sam and Nick, &c. 
To Mrs. Murphy's house we got, and straightway all went 
in, 
We eat her hash and fish-balls up, we drank her beer and 
gin, 
In fact a 
jollier crowd, was never seen before, 
Than we, when starting to go home, from Mrs. Murphy's 
door. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, you can bet your stamps there wasn't a 
gal 
or fellow belonging to that party, but was fifty above proof. 
We got " spilled out of the sleigh two-by-two. 
Sam fell 
into Florence's water trough; while Sue spent the night in a 
frog pond, singing Home Sweet Home. Dick was found 
in the middle of Harlem Lane, trying to strangle himself 
with Bridget Delany's pompadour. 
Nick got entangled 
in Lucy's hoop-skirts, and as for myself and Kitty, we shall 
never forget the time, when we went sleighing 
With Sam and Nick, &c.

Tt iE night I

When myself and all the'hig bugs met, 
For a 
glorious supper they had met, 
At the hash and lish-ball party. 
A darkey cook of great reit-iwn,

Miss Susan Anthony did try, 
To hit John G. Saxe with an oyster Pie, 
While the British Ambassador drunk cud lie,

Ohl Greenback Chase broke every dish,

Mr. Boston Jubiloo Gilmore, said, 
lie could swallow a 
sausage : old stand on his head, 
Then Mrs. John Wood went tight to boil, 
I'rom the hash and tish-ball party. 
Miss Cady Stanton feared the worst, 
For she eat so notch her corset joust, 
Then Sunset Cox he fumed and cursed, 
And all the sapper he'd el.tt disliursed. 
The company there sorm . rcreame.1 with pain,

Henry Stanley Ilegged for one plat' more, 
('hail s 
Francis Adonis for pudding- at roar, 
While the darkey waiters loudly swore,

The Congressmen all, as drunk they lay, 
Did vote themselves more extra pay, 
And eat anything that It

That Venus IS the cause of our downfall. 
Those pretty dove-like eyes 
That waft us to the skies, 
Then dashes us to mother earth again, 
With arms entwining fair, 
Aml bonnie silken hair— 
Alas, art thou the cause of all our pain ? 
Must I

Or dissolve this earthly dream of love, 
Awl live It

Thy guardian angel weeping, waits for thee,

THE CITY CHARTER, 
AIR : 
King of the Cannibal islands. 
AS 
Sung by TONY PASTOR. 
Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1874, by A ,T. 
FISIIER, in Unice of the Librarian of Congi 0,4s, at Washington. 
WHAT a 
funny tale I've got to tell 
A 
tale I 
think will please you well, 
'Tis about that late political sell, 
They call the City Charter, 
In it they tax the people all, 
Men and women, great and small ; 
Dogs and babies, short and tall, 
No matter how they bark or bawl, 
You are taxed for what you eat and drink, 
You are also taxed for what you think, 
And you'll have to pay if you ever wink— 
'Tis the law of the City Charter. 
A 
baby on its mammy's knee, 
A 
cobbler having his Monday's spree, 
The man who his sweetheart goes to see— 
Are taxed in the City Charter. 
If you dye your hair you've got to pay, 
You must wash your face but once a 
day ; 
And wear a 
dress till it drops away. 
If you find a 
dollar you must let it lay, 
58 
But kiss a 
lady you think nice, 
The Albany men being made of ice, 
Will make you pay for the luxury twice— 
'Tis marked down in the Charter. 
You are not allowed to change your clothes, 
You've got to pay if you blow your nose, 
It's a 
dollar for wearing nails on your toes— 
All in the City Charter. 
They tax you for soap, they charge you for dirt) 
'Tis a 
quarter for having a 
tail to your shirt, 
And if the ladies wear a 
bustle or skirt, 
They'll have to settle or cut them short. 
In fact it does exceed belief, 
You must swallow your food without using your teeth 
And every fat man must take in a 
reef— 
Or they'll go for him in the Charter. 
You must pay for your fat, they charge you for lean, 
For too much sense, or for being green: 
Such clauses never before were seen— 
As they've got in the City Charter. 
You'd have to pay if you loudly spoke, 
They charge you extra for being broke, 
And if you at a 
nice girl look, 
Such privileges are from you took : 
'Tis a 
fine to go upon the " tare," 
Or use a 
false switch with your hair; 
But charge what they like, I'll at them swear 
When they put in force—the Charter. 
Entered according to the Act cf Congress, in the year 1874, by A. J. 
Fist!En, in the ° thee of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington. 
IF you take tip a printed newspaper, I 
will prove there's 
as much common sense, 
If you read it from corner to corner, 
or down at the 
bottom commence; 
Now I'll show it by yesterday's issue, that what I 
have 
told you is true, 
Of course I 
shall read the print backward, if you think its 
the same thing to you. 
A 
robbery of bonds down in Wall street, ' twas done by the 
great Dr. Tyng, 
Peter Cooper has choked Josie Mansfield, the loan that 
was found in Sing ,Sing ; 
Jew Irving, our prince of detectives, got Judge Cox in a 
very nice fix, 
He was dealing right "mug from the bottom, at casino with 
Governor Dix. 
Jenny Engel, the great lady comic, with Bonner's horse 
Dexter did trot, 
Barney Williams discovered a 
comet, in Baxter street right 
On the spot. 
Sheriff Connor from Nichols, the tailor,with 114: six dollar 
pants ran away, 
55 
Ben Wood hung himself on the Island, with the mustache 
of famed Charley Shay. 
Harry Hill joined the church as a 
member, he was con-
verted by Leona Dare; 
lie bought a 
house on i 
he waters of Jordan, so he now for 
the " Devil " don't care. 
Ithinie Warren she wants a divorce soon from Com-
modore Nutt to be free, 
To elope with that infant Olialdwin, and a beautiful 
couple they'll be. 
Pauline Markham got seized with the colic, she swallowed 
a 
plate of fish- balls, 
And she spent for her share of the frolic a 
night in the 
Tombs marble halls. 
But now of this page there's an ending, to turn over I 
don't 
feel inclined, 
Though some other night when I'm singing, I'll read all 
the news I 
can find. 
A JOLLY OLD COCKLE AM I. 
! 
a 
jolly old Cockle am I, 
And a 
merry life I 
lead. 
Making my bed of shingle red, 
Under the green sea- weed, 
Under the green sea- weed. 
Under the briny wave, 
Over the slimy sand, 
Where the silver waters lave 
The shell on the pebbly strand, 
On I 
whirl, 
On I 
whirl a 
son of the sea, 
On thro' the waters joyously, 
On through the waters joyously. 
Oh! a 
jolly old Cockle am I, 
And a 
glorious life I 
lead, 
Making my bed of shingle red, 
Under the green sea-weed, 
On I 
whirl a 
son of the sea, 
On thro' the waters joyously. 
A 
respectable black is my garb, 
Turn'd up with a 
white cravat 
And pilgrims long as they tell in song, 
have borrow'd my shape for a 
hat, 
Have borrow'd lily shape for a 
hat. 
Whirl, and wind, and wriggle. 
Where ocean spiral; roam, 
The Fisherman's net will only go 
The Cockle away from his home. 
On I 
whirl, 
On I 
whirl a 
son of the sea, 
On thro' the waters joyously. 
On thro' the waters joyously. 
Oh, a 
jolly old Cockle am I, 
And a 
glorious life I 
lead, 
Making my bed of shingle red, 
Under the green sea-weed, 
On I 
whirl a 
son of the sea, 
On thro' the waters joyously, 
On I 
whirl a 
son of the sea, 
On thro' the waters joyously.

GRANT'S INAUGURATION BALL. 
As sung by TONY PASTOR. 
A CURIOUS story I 
am now going to tell you, 
If but for a 
moment you'll listen to me, 
A 
bull-dog was presented to Hiram Ulyssis, 
So of course we determined to all have a 
spree. 
A 
dance was given by Grant, the great smoker, 
At which Parson Brownlow the figures did call, 
While mysel Edwin Booth and Barnum's What Is It, 
Did form the first set at the President's ball. • 
They all took a 
cocktail, when each dance was over, 
Till getting excited they quick came to blows, 
Oakes Ames called Beecher an old corner loafer, 
Charles Sumner he pulled Anna Dickinson's nose, 
henry Wilson he kissed the black cook in the kitchen, 
Lydia Thompson accused him of stealing her shawl, 
Fred Douglas when drinking he swallowed the bottle. 
And was punip'd out by Carl Shurz at the President's ball. 
Ben Butler was caught with a 
spoon in his pocket, 
lie tried for to palm it on Father Tom Burke, 
Colfax stole the back hair of Miss Tennie Clallin. 
Captain Jack tried to find how the old thing did work, 
Mrs. Woodhull got fighting with big Ned 0' Baldwin, 
Judge Poland's committee they blackmailed them all, 
Old Pomeroy was seized with tne eppipizootics, 
And tried to bribe all the folks at the President's ball. 
Dr. Newman, the parson, proposed to play cribbage, 
To cheat Senator Caldwell, he put up a 
job, 
George Francis Train got knock'd down in the scrimmage, 
With a 
hit from the crib- board, called one for his nob, 
Geceral Grant by this time wits " tight" under the table, 
Andy Johnson he flattened his nose'gainst the wall, 
John B. Gough upon temperance he read them a 
lecture. 
And then got drunk himself at the President's ball. 
When daylight approached they lay close together, 
The guests and the waiters were all in a 
heap, 
General Sherman was hooked on to Miss Josie Mansfield, 
With Fronde, the historian taking a 
peep. 
They made such a 
rumpus they woke Mrs. Grant up, 
She called in the militia to clear out them all, 
Brigham Young eat so much that he busted his boiler, 
And that put an end to the President's ball.

Courting Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
st, meet a 
want frequently felt by young people-a want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a way as to be non-committal. 
Itlauy young :,adies are visited by gentlemen who are either too dim. 
dent or too tearful of a 
iepulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. 
The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unlady-like encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many 
lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. This Pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
-
se phase of courtship. 
Th e sen ti ments conveyed therein need not be 
-
41* adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties  - • Price 25 Cents,

encourage the bad habit of " flirting." 
Unfortunately, there is enough

where to do it," and this little volume would advise and initiate the um-
oerrupted in practicing what is commonly called "flirting."
