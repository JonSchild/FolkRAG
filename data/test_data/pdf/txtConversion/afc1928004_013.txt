IRISH SONGS, 
I'M A RANTING, ROVING BLADE. 
Wrfoo! I'm a 
ranting, roving blade, 
Of never a 
thing was I 
afraid ; 
I'm a 
gintleman born, and scorn a 
thrade, 
And I'd be a 
rich man if my debts was paid. 
But my debts is worth something ; this truth 
they instil, 
That pride makes us fall all against our will ; 
For ' twas pride that broke me—I 
was happy 
until 
I 
was ruined all out by my tailor's bill. 
I'm the finest guide you ever did see, 
I 
know every place of curiosity 
From Thig-a-na Vauragh to Donaghadee, 
And if you're for sport come along wid me. 
I'll lade you sporting round about— 
We've wild ducks and widgeon, and snipe, and 
throat ; 
And I 
know where they are, and what they're 
about, 
And if they're not at home, then I'm sure they're 
out.

LOVER'S 
The miles in this counthry much longer be— 
But that is a 
saving of time d'you see, 
For two of our miles is aiqual to three, 
Which shortens the road in a 
great degree. 
And the roads in this place is so plenty, we say, 
That you've nothing to do but to find your way; 
If your hurry's not great, and you've time to 
delay, 
You can go the short cut, that's the longest way. 
And I'll show you heaps of good drinkin' too, 
For I 
know the place where the whiskey grew; 
A 
bottle is good when it's not too new, 
And I'm fond of one, but I'd die for two. 
Truth is scarce when liars is near, 
But squeeling is plenty when pigs you shear, 
And mutton is high when cows is dear, 
And rint is scarce four times a 
year. 
Such a 
country for growing you ne'er did be-
howld, 
We grow rich when we're poor, we grow hot 
when we're cowld; 
And the girls they know bashfulness makes us 
grow bowld, 
We grow young when we like, but we never 
grow o 
wld. 
And the sivin small senses grows natural here, 
For praties has eyes, and can see quite clear; 
And the kitties is singing with scalding tears, 
And the corn- fields is listening with all their ears. 
IRISH SONGS. 
7 
But along with sivin senses we have one more— 
Of which I 
forgot for to tell you before: 
'Tis nonsense, spontaneously gracing our shore, 
And I'll tell you the rest when I 
think of more. 
Let the farmer praise his grounds, 
Let the huntsman praise his hounds, 
The shepherd his dew- scented lawn ; 
But I, more bless'd than they, 
Spend each happy night and day, 
With my charming little cruiskin lawn, 
lawn, lawn. 
With my charming little cruiskin lawn. 
Immortal and divine, 
Great Bacchus, god of wine, 
Create me by adoption your son, 
In hope that you'll comply, 
That my glass shall ne .er run dry, 
Nor my smiling little 
cruiskin lawn, 
lawn, lawn. 
Nor my smiling little cruiskin lawn. 
And when grim Death appears, 
In a 
few but pleasant years, 
To tell me that my glass has run; 
I'll say, begone you knave, 
For bold Bacchus gave me leave 
To take another cruiskin lawn, lawn, 
lawn, 
To take another cruiskin lawn. 
8 
LOVER'S 
Then fill your glasses high, 
Let's not part with lips adry, 
Though the lark now proclaims it is dawn; 
And since we can't remain, 
May we shortly meet again, 
To fill another cruiskin lawn, lawn, lawn. 
To fill another cruiskin lawn. 
:THE BOWLD SOJER BOY. 
Oh, there's not a 
trade that's going, 
Worth showing, 
Or knowing, 
Like that from glory growing, 
For a 
bowld sojer boy; 
Where right or left we go, 
Sure you know, 
Friend or foe, 
Will have the hand—or toe, 
From a 
bowld sojer boy ; 
There's not a 
town we march through, 
But the ladies' looking arch through 
The window-panes, will search through 
The ranks to find their joy; 
While up the street, 
Each girl you meet, 
With look so sly, 
Will cry 
" 
My eye! 
Oh, isn't he a 
darling—the bowld sojer boy !" 
But when we get the rout, 
How they pout, 
IRISH SONGS. 
9 
And they shout, 
While to the right about 
Goes the bowld sojer boy; 
'Tis then that ladies fair, 
In despair 
Tear their hair, 
But the dev'l a 
one I 
care, 
Says the bowld sojer boy; 
For the world is all before us, 
Where the landladies adore us, 
And ne'er refuse to score us, 
But chalk us up with joy; 
We taste her tap, 
We tear her cap, 
" 
Oh, that's the chap, 
For me," 
Says she, 
" 
Oh, isn't he a 
darling—the bowld sojer boy." 
Then come along with me, 
Gramachree, 
And you'll see 
How happy you will be 
With your bowld sojer boy; 
Faith, if you're up to fun, 
With me run, 
'Twill be done 
In the snapping of a 
gun, 
Says the bowld sojer boy; 
And ' tis then that without scandal, 
Myself will proudly dandle 
The little farthing candle 
Of our mutual flame, my joy; 
10 
LOVER'S 
May his light shine, 
As bright as mine, 
Till in the line 
He'll blaze 
And raise 
The glory of his corps, like a 
bowld sojer boy. 
TIIE BLARNEY. 
Mils. S.C. HALL. 
Oh, when a 
young bachelor woos a 
young maid, 
Who's eager to go, and yet willing to stay, 
She sighs and she blushes, and looks half afraid, 
Yet loses no word that her lover can say, 
What is it she hears but the blarney ? 
Oh, a 
perilous thing is this blarney ! 
To all that he tells her she gives no reply, 
Or murmurs and whispers so gentle and low ; 
And though he has asked her when nobody's by, 
She dare not say " yes," and. she cannot say 
" 
no." 
She knows what she hears is the blarney, 
Oh, a 
perilous thing is this blarney ! 
But people get used to a 
perilous thing, 
And fancy the sweet words of lovers are true ; 
So let all their blarney be passed through a 
ring, 
The charm will prevent all the ill it can do. 
And maids have no fear of the blarney, 
Nor the peril that lies in the blarney. 
IRISH SONGS.

IT'S LITTLE FOR GLORY I 
CARE. 
It's little for glory I 
care, 
Sure ambition is only a 
fable; 
I'd as soon be myself as Lord Mayor, 
With lashins of drink on the table. 
I 
like to lie down in the sun, 
And. drame when my fay Lures is scorchin', 
That when I'm too ould for more fun, 
Why, I'll marry a 
wife with a 
fortune. 
And in Winter, with bacon and eggs, 
And a 
place at the turf fire basking, 
Sip my punch as I 
roasted my legs, 
Oh, the devil a 
more I'd be asking. 
For I 
haven't a 
jaynius for work, 
It was never the gift of the Bradies, 
But I'd make a 
most illigant Turk, 
For I'm fond of tobacco and. ladies. 
THE LOW—BACKED CAR. 
When first I 
saw sweet Peggy, 
'Twas on a 
market day, 
A 
low- backed car she drove,. and. sat 
Upon a 
truss of hay ; 
But when that hay was blooming grass, 
And decked. with flowers of Spring, 
No tlow'r was there that could compare 
With the blooming girl I 
sing. 
As she sat in the low- backed car— 
The man at the turnpike bar 
Never asked. for the toll, 
But just rubbed his old poll, 
And looked. after the low-backed car. 
12 
LOVER'S 
In battle's wild commotion, 
The proud and mighty Mars, 
With hostile scythes, demands his tithes 
Of death—in warlike cars ; 
While Peggy, peaceful goddess, 
Has darts in her bright eye, 
That knock men down, in the market town, 
As right and left they fly— 
While she sits in her low backed car, 
Than battle more dangerous far— 
For the doctor's art 
Cannot cure the heart 
That is hit from that low backed car. 
Sweet Peggy, round her car, sir, 
Has strings of ducks and geese, 
But the scores of hearts she slaughters 
By far out-number these; 
While she among her poultry sits, 
Just like a 
turtle dove, 
Well worth the cage, I 
do engage, 
Of the blooming god of love! 
While she sits in her low-backed car, 
The lovers come near and far, 
And envy the chicken 
That Peggy is pickin', 
As she sits in the low-backed car. 
Oh, I'd rather own that car, sir, 
With Peggy by my side, 
Than a 
coach-and-four, and goold galore, 
And a 
lady for my bride; 
For the lady would sit forninst me, 
On a 
cushion made with taste, 
While Peggy would sit beside me 
With my arm around her waist—

IAISH SONGS.

While we drove in the low-backed car, 
To be married by Father Maher, 
Oh, my heart would beat high 
At her glance and her sigh— 
Though it beat in a 
low-backed car. 
THE POPE HE LEADS A HAPPY LIFE. 
CHARLES LEVER. 
The Pope he leads a 
happy life, 
He knows no cares nor marriage strife; 
He drinks the best of Rhenish wine— 
I 
would the Pope's gay lot were mine. 
But yet not happy- 
is his life— 
He loves no maid or wedded wife, 
Nor child hath he to cheer his hope--
I 
would not wish to be the Pope. 
The Sultan better pleases me, 
He leads a 
life of jollity, 
Has wives as many as he will— 
I 
would the Sultan's throne then fill. 
But yet he's not a 
happy man— 
He must obey the Alcoran; 
And dares not taste one drop of wine— 
I 
would not that his lot were mine. 
So here I 
take my lowly stand, 
I'll drink my own, my native land; 
I'll kiss my maiden's lips divine, 
And drink the best of Rhenish wine. 
And when my maiden kisses me, 
I'll fancy I 
the Sultan be; 
And when my cheering glass I 
tope, 
I'll fancy then I 
am the Pope.

THE WHITE COCKADE. 
King Charles he is King James's son, 
And from a 
royal line is sprung; 
Then up with shout, and out with blade, 
And we'll raise once more the white cockade. 
Oh, my dear! my fair-hair'd youth, 
Thou yet 'fast hearts of fire and truth ; 
Then up with shout, and out with blade, 
We'll raise once more the white cockade. 
My young men's hearts are dark with woe; 
On my virgins' cheeks the grief- drops flow; 
The sun scarce lights the sorrowing day, 
Since our rightful prince went far away ; 
He's gone, the stranger holds his throne ; 
The royal bird far off is flown; 
But up with the shout, and out with blade— 
We'll stand or fall with the white cockade. 
No more the cuckoo hails the Spring, 
The woods no more with the stanch-hounds ring; 
The song from the glen, so sweet before, 
Is husli'd since Charles has left our shore. 
The prince is gone, but he soon will come, 
With . trumpet sound, and with beat of drum ; 
Then up with shout, and out with blade— 
Huzza for the right and the white cockade. 
WIDOW MACHREE. 
f 
Widow Machree, it's no wonder you frown, 
Och hone ! Widow Machree ; 
Faith, it ruins your looks, that same dirty black 
gown, 
Och hone! Widow Machree. 
IRISH SONGS. 
How altered you air, 
With that close cap you wear— 
'Tis destroying your hair, 
Which should be flowing free; 
Be no longer a 
churl 
Of its black silken curl, 
Och hone I 
Widow Machree. 
15 
Widow Machree, now the Summer is come, 
Och hone Widow Machree; 
When everything smiles, should a 
beauty look 
glum ? 
Och hone! Widow Machree. 
See the birds go in pairs, 
And the rabbits and hares, 
Why, even the bears 
Now in couples agree; 
And the mute little fish, 
Though they can't spake, they wish, 
Och hone! Widow Machree. 
Widow Machree, and when Winter comes in, 
Och hone ! Widow Machree; 
To be poking the fire all alone is a 
sin, 
Och hone ! Widow Machree. 
Sure the shovel and tongs 
To each other belongs, 
And the kittle sings songs 
Full of family glee; 
Yet alone with your cup, 
Like a 
hermit you sup. 
Och hone! Widow Machree. 
And how do you know, with the comforts I've 
towld, 
Och hone! Widow Machree, 
- 
IC 
LOVER'S 
But you're keeping some poor fellow out in the 
cowld! 
Och hone! widow Machree. 
With such sins on your bead, 
Sure your peace would be fled, 
Could you sleep in your bed, 
Without thinking to see 
Some ghost or some sprite, 
That would wake you each night, 
Crying " Och hone! Widow Machree ?" 
Then take my advice, darling Widow Machree, 
Och hone! Widow Machree; 
And with my advice, faith I 
wish you'd take me, 
Och hone! Widow Machree. 
You'd have me to desire 
Then to stir up the fire, 
And sure Hope is no liar 
In whispering to me 
That the ghosts would depart 
When you'd me near your heart, 
Oda hone! Widow Machree. 
THE BLARNEY. 
SAMUEL LOVER. 
Air " Kate Kearney." 
Oh, did you ne'er bear of the Blarney, 
That's found near the banks of Killarney; 
Believe it from me— 
No girl's heart is free, 
Once she hears the sweet sound of the Blarney. 
IRISR SONGS. 
17 
For the Blarney's so great a 
desaiver, 
That a 
girl thinks you're there—tho' you leave 
her, 
And never finds out 
All the thricks you're about, 
Till she's quite gone herself, with your Blarney. 
Oh, say, would you find this same Blarney, 
There's a 
castle, not far from Killarney, 
On the top of the wall— 
But take care you don't fall, 
There's a 
stone that contains all this Blarney. 
Like a 
magnet, it's influence such is, 
That attraction it gives all it touches, 
If you kiss it, they say, 
That from that blessed day, 
You may kiss whom you plaze, with your Blarney. 
WIDOW MALONE. 
CHARLES LEVER. 
Did you hear of the widow Malone, 
Ohone! 
Who lived in the town of Athlone ? 
Ohone! 
Oh, she melted the hearts 
Of the swains in them parts, 
So lovely the Widow Malone, 
So lovely the widow Malone. 
Of lovers she had a 
full score, 
Ohone 
Or more, 
LevER's 
And fortunes they all had galore, 
In store ; 
From the minister down 
To the clerk of the crown, 
All were courting the Widow Malone, 
Ohone! 
All were courting the Widow Malone. 
But so modest was Mistress Malone, 
'Twas known, 
That no one could see her alone, 
Ohone! 
Let them ogle and sigh, 
They could ne'er catch her eye, 
So bashful the Widow Malone, 
Ohone 
So bashful the Widow Malone. 
'Till one Mister O'Brien, from Clare— 
How quare! 
It's little for blushing they care 
Down there, 
Put his arm around her waist— 
Gave ten kisses at laste— 
" 
Oh," says he, " you're my Molly Malone, 
My own !" 
" 
Oh," says he, " you're my Molly Malone." 
And the widow they all thought so shy, 
My eye,! 
Ne'er thought of a 
simper or sigh, 
For why ? 
But " Lucius," says she, 
" 
Since you've now made so free, 
You may marry your Mary Malone, 
Ohone! 
You may marry your Mary Malone."

If for widows you die, 
Learn to kiss, not to sigh, 
For they're all like sweet Mistress Malone, 
Ohone! 
Oh, they're all like sweet Mistress Malone. 
There's a 
moral contained in my song, 
Not wrong, 
And one comfort, it's not very long, 
But strong, 
THE BOYS OF KILKENNY. 
Air " Meeting of the Waters." 
Oh, the boys of Kilkenny are nate roving blades, 
And whenever they meet with the dear little 
maids, 
They kiss them, and coax them, and spend their 
money free; 
Oh, of all towns in Ireland, Kilkenny for me. 
Oh, of all towns, &c. 
Through the town of Kilkenny there runs a 
clare 
strame, 
In the town of Kilkenny there lives a 
fair dame, 
Her cheeks are like roses—and her lips much the 
same— 
Or a dish of ripe strawberries smothered in 
crame. 
Or a 
dish, &c. 
Her eyes are as black as Kilkenny's famed coal, 
And 'tis they through my poor heart have burnt 
a 
big hole; 
20 
LOVER'S 
Her mind, like its river, is deep, clear, and pure, 
But her heart is more hard than it's marble, I'm 
sure. 
But her heart, Sze. 
Oh, Kilkenny's a 
fine town that shines where it 
stands, 
And the morel think on it the more my heart 
warms ; 
If I 
was in Kilkenny I'd feel quite at home. 
For it's there I'd get sweethearts, but here I 
get 
none. 
For it's there, &c. 
RORY O'MORE. 
Young Rory O'More courted Kathleen bawn, 
He was bold as a 
hawk—she as soft as the dawn; 
He wished in his heart pretty Kathleen to please, 
And he thought the best way to do that was to 
tease ; 
" 
Now Rory, be aisy," sweet Kathleen would cry, 
Reproof on her lip, but a 
smile in her eye ; 
" 
With your tricks, I 
don't know, in troth, what 
I'm about, 
Faith, you've tea,s'd till I've put on my cloak in-
side out!" 
" 
Och jewel," says Rory, " that same is the way 
You've thrated my heart for this many a 
day, 
And ' tis plased that I 
am, and why not, to be 
sure ? 
For ' tis all 
for good luck," says bold Rory 
O'More.

" 
Indeed then," says Kathleen, " don't think of 
the like, 
For I 
half gave a 
promise to soothering Mike, 
The ground that I 
walk on he loves, I'llbe bound,' 
" 
Faith," says Rory, " I'd rather love you than 
the ground." 
" 
Now, Rory, I'll cry, if you don't let me go, 
Sure I 
dhrame every night that I 
am hating you 
so," 
" 
Och, says Rory, " that same I'm delighted to 
hear, 
For dhrames always go by conthraries, my dear; 
So, jewel, keep dhramin' that same till you die, 
And bright mornin' will give dirty night the black 
lie; 
And ' tis pleased that I 
am, and why not to be 
sure ? 
Since ' tis all for good luck," says bold Rory 
O'More. 
"Arrah, Kathleen, my darlint, you've teased me 
enough, 
Sure I've thrash'd for your sake Dinny Grimes 
and Jim Duff, 
And I've made myself, dhrinkin' your health, 
quite a 
baste, 
So I 
think, after that, I 
may talk to the priest." 
Then Rory, the rogue, stole his arm round her 
neck, 
So soft, and so white, without freckle or speck; 
And he looked in her eyes that were beaming 
with light, 
And he kiss'd her sweet lips—don't you think 
he was right ? 
"Now Rory, leave off, 
sir, you'll hug me no 
more,

O'More. 
OVER THE HILLS AND FAR AWAY. 
Once I 
bloom'd a 
maiden young, 
A 
widow's woe now moves my tongue; 
My true love's barque ploughs ocean's spray, 
Over the hills and far away. 
Chorus.—Oh! had I 
worlds, I'd yield them now, 
To place me on his tall barque's prow, 
Who was my choice through child-
hood's day, 
Over the hills and far away. 
Oh ! may we yet our lov'd one meet, 
With joy- bells' chime, and wild drums' beat; 
While summoning war-trump sounds dismay, 
Over the hills and far away 1 
Oh ! had. I 
worlds, &c. 
Oh! that my hero had his throne, 
That Erin's cloud of care were flown, 
That the proudest prince would own his sway, 
Over the hills and far away !

Oh ! once we were illigant people, 
Though we now live in cabins of mud; 
And the land that ye see from the steeple, 
Belonged to us all from the flood. 
My father was then king of Connaught, 
My grandaunt viceroy of Tralee; 
But the Sassenach came, and, signs on it! 
The divil an acre have we. 
The least of us then were all earls, 
And jewels we wore without name ; 
We drank punch out of rubies and pearls 
Mr. Petrie can tell you the same. 
But, except some turf mould and potatoes, 
There's nothing our own we can call ; 
And the English—bad luck to them !—bate us, 
Because we've more fun than them all!

And an illigant song- he could sing, NI be bail; 
He would. ride with the rector, and drink with

Oh, the broth of a

It's little he cared for thejuage or recorder, 
His house was as big and as strong as a

With a 
cruel four-pounder, he kept all in great 
order, 
He'd murder the country, would Larry WHale.

He'd a

I 
wish you could see how he'd empty a

For he handled it nately, did Larry 
His ancestors was kings before Moses was born ; 
His mother descended from great Grana, Uaile; 
He laughed all the Blakes and the Frenches to 
scorn; 
They were mushrooms compared to old Larry 
WHale. 
He sat down every day to a 
beautiful dinner, 
With cousins and uncles enough for a 
tail ; 
And, though loaded with debt, oh, the devil a 
thinner 
Could law or the sheriff make Larry M'Hale. 
With a 
larder supplied, and. a 
cellar well stored. 
None lived half so well from Fair Head to 
Kinsale, 
And he piously said, " I've a 
plentiful board, 
And the Lord he is good to old Larry M'Hale." 
So fill up your glass, and a high bumper give 
him,

fine country to live in, 
If we only had plenty like Larry M'Hale.

Thy tresses so brightly adorning ? 
Oh, light of foot and heart were then

The cares that shade the brows of men 
Ne'er darkened childhood's morning. 
Oh, who can forget the young innocent hours

The hunter's horn did ring, 
As the milk-white doe 
Escaped his bow, 
Down by the haunted spring; 
In vain his silver horn he wound, 
'Twas echo answer'd back ; 
For neither groom nor baying hound 
Was on the hunter's track ; 
In vain he sought the milk-white doe 
That made him stray, and ' soaped his bow, 
For' save himself, no living thing, 
Was by the silent haunted spring. 
The purple heath-bells, blooming fair, 
Their fragrance round did fling, 
As the hunter lay, 
At close of day, 
Down by the haunted sprinc:; 
A 
lady fair, in robe of white, 
To greet the hunter came ; 
She kiss'd a 
cup with jewels bright, 
And pledged him by his name ; 
" 
Oh, lady fair," the hunter cried, 
" 
Be thou my love, my blooming bride,

And wakes the peasants' evening fears, 
While distant bugles faintly ring 
Around the lonely haunted spring.

True love can ne'er forget ; 
Fondly as when we met, 
Dearest, I

Thus sung a

His sweet impassion'd lay, 
Down by the ocean's spray 
At set of sun; 
But wither'd was the minstrel's sight, 
Morn to him was dark as night, 
Yet his heart was full of light; 
As he his lay begun.

True love can ne'er forget; 
Fondly as when we met, 
Dearest, I

Long years are past and o'er, 
Since from this fatal shore, 
Cold hearts and cold winds bore 
My love from me."

When quick, with flashing stroke,

boat's light oar the silence broke 
Over the sea; 
Soon upon her native strand 
Doth a 
lovely lady land, 
While the minstrel's love- taught hand 
Did o'er his wild harp run— 
" 
True love can ne'er forget; 
Fondly as when we met, 
Dearest, I 
love thee yet, 
My darling one!" 
Where the minstrel sat alone 
There, that lady fair hath gone, 
Within his hand she placed her own, 
The bard dropped on his knee; 
From his lips soft blessings came, 
lie kiss'd her hand with truest flame, 
In trembling tones he named—her name, 
Though her he could not see. 
But oh !—the touch the hard could tell 
Of that dear hand, remember'd well,

Time went on and left Beauty in tears; 
He's a

So he boasted to all of the fair lady's fall,

So shock'd was poor Beauty to find that her fame

He from his quiver drew ;

In vain," said she, " you shoot at me,

Oh, lore is the soul of an Irish dragoon, 
In battle, in bivouac, or in saloon— 
From the tip of his spur to his bright saber-
tasche. 
With his soldierly gait and his bearing so high, 
his gay, laughing look, and his light, speaking 
eye; 
He frowns at his rival, he ogles his wench, 
lie springs on his saddle and chasses the French, 
With his jingling spur and his bright saber-
tasche.

His spirits are high and he little knows care, 
Whether sipping his claret or charging a 
square, 
With his jingling spur and his bright saber-
tasche. 
As ready to sing or to skirmish he's found, 
To take off his wine or to take up his ground : 
When the bugle may call him how little he fears 
To charge forth in column and beat the Moun-
seers— 
With his jingling spur and his bright saber-
tasche. 
When the battle is over he gaily rides back 
To cheer every soul in the night bivouac__ 
With his jingling spur and his bright saber-
tasche. 
Oh ! there you may see him in full glory crown'd, 
And he sits ' mid his friends on the hardly- won 
ground. 
And hear with what feeling the toast he will 
give, 
As he drinks to the land where all Irishmen lire, 
With his jingling spur and his bright saber-
tasche.

The night both drear and dark, 
Our poor devoted bark, 
Till next day, there she lay, 
In the Bay of Biscay, 0! 
Now dash'd upon the billow, 
Our opening timbers creak ; 
Each fears a

None stops the dreadful leak ; 
To cling to slipp'ry shrouds 
Each breathless seaman crowds, 
As she lay, till next day, 
In the Bay of Biscay, 0 ! 
At length the wish'd for morrow 
Broke thro' the hazy sky ; 
Absorb'd in silent sorrow, 
Each heav'd a 
bitter sigh ; 
The dismal wreck to view 
Struck horror to the crew, 
As she lay, on that day, 
In the Bay of Biscay, 0! 
Her yielding timbers sever, 
Her pitchy seams are rent, 
When Heaven, all bounteous ever, 
Its boundless mercy sent ; 
A

Now we sail, with the gale,

Oh, Mary dear, oh, Mary fair, 
Oh, branch of generous stem, 
White blossom of the banks of Nair, 
Though lilies grow on them ; 
You've left me sick at heart for love, 
So faint I 
canhot see ; 
The candle swims the hoard above, 
I'm drunk for love of thee ! 
Oh, stately stem of maiden pride, 
My woe it is, an(i pain, 
That I, thus severed from thy side, 
The long night must remain. 
Through all the towns of Innisfa,iI, 
I've wandered far and wide, 
But, from Downpatrick to Kinsale, 
From Carlow to KiLbride, 
'Moth; lords and dames of high degree, 
Where'er my feet have gone, 
My Mary, one to equal thee 
I 
never looked upon ; 
I 
live in darkness and in doubt, 
Whene'er my love's away; 
But were the gracious sun put out, 
Her shadow would make day. 
'Tis she, indeed, young bud of bliss, 
As gentle as she's fair— 
Though lily-white her bosom is, 
And sunny bright her hair, 
And dewy azure her blue eye, 
And rosy red her cheek,

Hours like those I 
spent with you, 
So bright, so passing, and so few, 
May never bless me more— farewell! 
My heart can feel, but dare not tell, 
The rapture of those hours of light 
Thus snatched from sorrow's cheerless night. 
'Tis not thy cheek's soft blended hue ; 
'Tis not thine eye. of Heavenly blue ; 
'Tis not the radiance of thy brow, 
That thus would win or charm me now ; 
It is thy heart's warm light, that glows 
Like sunbeams on December snows. 
It is thy wit, that flashes bright 
As lightning on a 
stormy night, 
Illuming e'en the clouds that roll 
Along the darkness of my soul, 
And bidding with an angel's voice, 
The heart that knew no joy—rejoice.

Too late we meet—too soon we part, 
Yet dearer to my soul thou art 
Than some whose love has grown with years, 
Smiled with my smile, and wept my tears. 
Farewell ! but, absent, thou shalt seem 
The vision of some heavenly dream, 
Too bright on child of earth to dwell; 
It must be so—my friend, farewell!

I 
love my love in the morning, 
For she like morn is fair, 
Her blushing cheek, its crimson streak,

Her glance, its beam so soft and kind ;

And her voice, the tender whispering wind 
That stirs the early bowers.

MY MOTHER DEAR. 
There was a 
place in childhood that I 
remember 
well, 
And there a 
voice of sweetest tone bright fairy 
tales did tell, 
And gentle words and fond embrace were giv'n 
with joy to me, 
When I 
was in that happy place— upon my 
mother's knee. 
When fairy tales were ended, " good night," she 
softly said, 
And kiss'd and laid me down to sleep within my 
tiny bed ; 
And holy words she taught me there—methinks 
I 
yet can see 
Her angel eyes, as close I 
knelt 
beside my 
mother's knee. 
In the sickness of my childhood ; the perils of 
my prime, 
The sorrows of my riper years; the cares of 
ev'ry time, 
When doubt and danger weigh'd me down—then 
pleading, all for me, 
It was a 
fervent pray'r to heaven that bent my 
mother's knee.

THE BIRTH OF SAINT PATRICK. 
On the eighth day of March it was, some people 
Say, 
That St. Patrick at midnight he first saw the 
day; 
While others declare ' twas the ninth he was 
born, 
And ' twas all a 
mistake between midnight and 
morn;

For mistakes will occur in a 
hurry and shock, 
And some blamed the baby—and some blamed 
the clock— 
'Till with all their cross questions sure no one 
could know 
If the child was too fast—or the clock was too 
slow. 
Now the first faction fight in owld Ireland, they 
say, 
Was all on account of Saint Patrick's birth- day, 
Some fought for the eighth—for the ninth more 
would die, 
And who wouldn't see right, sure they blacken'd 
his eye! 
At last both the factions so positive grew 
That each kept a 
birthday—so Pat then had two, 
'Till Father Mulcahy, who showed them their 
sins, 
Said " no one could have two birthdays but a 
twins." 
Says he, " boys, don't be fighting for eight or for 
nine, 
Don't be always dividing—but sometimes com-
bine ; 
Combine eight with nine, and seventeen is the 
mark, 
So let that be his birthday." " Amen," says 
the clerk. 
"If he wasn't a twins, sure our hisery will 
show— 
That, at least, he's worth two saints that we 
know !" 
Then they all got blind drunk—which completed 
their bliss, 
eind we kept up the practice from that day to

As on by bower, and town, and tower,

At. the dawning of the day. 
Her feet and beauteous head were bare, 
No mantle fair she wore, 
But down her waist fell golden hair 
That swept the tall grass o'er; 
With milking-pail she sought the vale, 
And bright her charms' display, 
Outshining far the morning star, 
At the dawning of the day! 
Beside me sat that maid divine, 
Where grassy banks outspread— 
" 
Oh, let me call thee ever mine, 
Dear maid," I 
sportive said. 
"False man, for shame, why bring me blame ?" 
She cried, and burst away—

Then come to the West, and the rose on thy 
mouth 
Will be sweeter to me than the flow'rs of the 
. South ! 
The North has its snow-tow'rs of dazzling array, 
All sparkling with gems in the ne'er-setting day; 
There the Storm- king may dwell in the halls he 
loves best, 
Bat the soft- breathing Zephyr he plays in the 
West. 
Then come there with me, where no cold wind 
doth blow, 
And thy neck will seem fairer to me than the 
snow! 
The Sun, in the gorgeous East, chaseth the night 
When he riseth, 
refresh'd, in his glory and 
might; 
But where cloth he go when he seeks his sweet 
rest ? 
Oh, cloth he not haste to the beautiful West ? 
Then come there with me, ' tis the laud I 
love 
best, 
'Tis the land of my sires !—' tis my own darling 
West!

LOVER'S 
MY NATIVE TOWN. 
We have heard of Charybdis and Scylla of old ; 
Of Maelstrom the modern enou ,rh has been told ; 
Of Vesuvius's blazes all travelers bold 
have established the bright renown : 
But spite of what ancients or moderns have 
said 
Of whirlpools so deep, or volcanoes so red, 
The place of all others on earth that I 
dread 
Is my beautiful native town. 
Where they sneer if you're poor, and they snarl 
if you're rich; 
They know every cut that you make in your flitch; 
If your hose should be darn'd, they can tell 
every stitch ; 
And they know when your wife got a 
gown. 
The old one, they say, was made new, for the 
brat; 
And they're sure you love mice—for you can't 
keep a 
cat; 
In the hot flame of scandal how blazes the fat, 
When it falls in your native town. 
If a 
good stream of blood chance to run in your 
veins, 
They think to remember it not worth the pains, 
For losses of caste are to them all the gains, 
So they treasure each base renown. 
If your mother sold apples—your father his oath 
And was cropp'd of his ears—yet you'll hear of 
them both; 
For loathing all low things they never are loath, 
In your virtuous native town. 
IRISH SONGS. 
69 
If the dangerous heights of renown you should 
try, 
And give all the laggards below the go-by, 
For fear you'd be hurt with your climbing so 
high, 
They're the first to pull you down. 
Should Fame give you wings, and you mount in 
despite. 
They swear Fame is wrong, and that they're in 
the right, 
And reckon you there—though you're far out of 
sight, 
Of the owls of your native town. 
Then give me the world, boys! that's open and 
wide, 
Where honest in purpose, and honest in pride, 
You are taken for just what you're worth when 
you're tried, 
And have paid your reckoning down. 
You coin's not mistrusted—the critical scale 
Does not weighevery piece, like a 
huckster at sale; 
The mint-mark is on it—although it might fail 
To pass in your native town. 
THE ROAD OF LIFE; 
OR, SONG OF THE IRISII POST-BOY. 
Oh, youth, happy youth ! what a 
blessing 1 
In thy freshness of dawn and of dew ; 
When Hope the young heart is caressing, 
And our griefs are but light and but few ; 
Yet in life, as it swiftly flies o'er us, 
Sonic musing for sadness we find; 
In youth—we've our troubles before us, 
In age—we leave pleasure behind. 
70 
LOVER'S 
Aye—Trouble's the post-boy that drives us 
lip hill, till we get to the top ; 
While Joy's an old servant behind us 
We call on for ever to stop ; 
" 
Oh, put on the drag, Joy, my jewel, 
As long as the sunset still glows ; 
Before it is dark ' twould be cruel 
To haste to the hill- foot's repose. 
• 
But there stands an inn we must stop at,. 
An extinguisher swings for the sign ; 
That house is but cold and but narrow : 
But the prospect beyond it's divine ! 
And there—whence there's never returning, 
When we travel—as travel we must— 
May the gates be all free for our journey? 
And the tears of our friends lay the dust ! 
cWHEN THIS OLD CAP WAS NEW. 
S. 
FERGUSON. 
Since this old cap was new, 
Now fifty-two long years, 
(It was at the review 
Of the Dublin Volunteers,) 
There have been brought to pass' 
With us a 
change or two ; 
They're altered times, alas I 
Since this old cap was new. 
Our Parliament did sit 
Then in our native land, 
What good came of the loss of it 
I 
cannot understand; 
IRISH SONGS. 
71 
Although full plain I 
see 
That changes not a 
few 
Have fallen on the countrie 
Since this old cap was new. 
They are very worthy fellows, 
(And much rd be distrest 
To think them else,)who tell us 
That all is for the best: 
Though full as ill inclined, 
Now the bargain's closed, to rue, 
Yet I 
can't but call the times to mind 
When this old cap was new. 
What rights we wanted then 
Were asked for above board, 
By a 
hundred thousand gentlemen, 
And render'd at the word. 
'Twas thus in fair day- light, 
With all the world to view, 
We claimed and gained our right, 
When this old cap was new. 
But patriots now-a-days, 
And state reformers, when 
A 
starving people's cry they raise, 
Tarn out like trenchermen. 
Ah, we'd have done the work, 
If it had been to do, 
With other tool than spoon or fork, 
When this old cap was new. 
The nobles of the country 
Were then our neighbors near, 
And ' mong us squires and. gentry 
Made always jolly cheer; 
72 
LOVER'S IRISH SONGS. 
Ah, every night at some one's 
Or other's was a 
crew 
Of merry lords and commons, 
When this old cap was new. 
They're altered times entirely, 
As plainly now appears ; 
Our landlord's face we barely see 
Past once in seven years. 
And now the man meets scorn 
As his coat is green or blue ; 
We had no need our coats to turn 
When this old cap was new. 
Good counsel to propose 
I 
have but little skill ; 
Yet ere a 
vain lament I 
close, 
In humble trust, I 
will 
Beseech for all His aid, 
Who knows what all should do ; 
And pray, as I 
have often prayed. 
Wb.eii this old cap was new.
