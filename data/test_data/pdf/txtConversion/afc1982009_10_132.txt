At the store, Clinton and Mae Iroler were joined by Berlie Largen 
and Ginny Lyon werergo4^ to demonstrate dances. MXfXK&X At the 
request of the dancers, Blanton Owen supplied M the music by 
playing the banjo. First, the two men demonstrate step dancing, 
as soloists. A full-body shot is followed by a retake in relative 
closeup on the feet. There are snatches of conversation between 
dances. At the end of the session (which stretches across two tapes), 
the two couples attempt to show some things about group dancing, but 
this is difficult in the cramped quarters and in the face of the 
many watchers. 
Two microphones were set up,iiH8XBX across from each other on two 
sides of the room. One of them probably gets more of the sound of 
the feet than the other.

On a regular basis thru the summer, local folks from the 
area around Meadows of Dan came to Mabry Mill to dance and 
. play music, a sort of volunteer program for the MfelKO tourists. 
Margaret Owen was interested in one of them, Luther Boyd. Some 
of this footage shows the group of dancers, but it features 
a good look at Boyd. 
At the end of the session, there is footage of the 
&&X banjo playing of Frank Dalton, made under the direction 
of Blanton Owen. 
The session covers three tapes (V3, V4, and V5). 
The Dalton material is on V5.

See MO fieldnotes for remarks BXXXH on this series of tapes. 
The series is V6, V7, and V8. 
- This was an attempt to document group dancing. 
Dix (pronounced Dick) Freeman owns this "extra dwelling," 
I believe, and gives it over to social events. This assemblage 
came together for the sake of our videotaping. (I was not present) 
Evidently the M&IX affair was only so successful, but there is 
a bit of footage of group dancing. I don't know the 
dancers' names. The musicians are identified by Margaret as 
the Pine Ridge Boys. Ernest East, fdl; Dix Freeman (bjo); 
Scotty East (gtr); Mac Snow (gtr); Chester McMillan (mndolin)
