Some More Greenback Dollar
SOME MORE GREENBACK DOLLAR
Indio Newspaper 1940
I don't want your little rag houses I don't want your navy beans All I want is a greenback
dollar For to buy some gasoline.
The scenery here is gettin' rusty I'll go further up the line Where the fields are green and
purty It will satisfy my mind
We don't want to be a burden On the people of this land We just want to earn our money
And you people know we can.
So goodbye my friends and neighbors We are on the tramp Many thanks to all officials Of
this migratory camp.
